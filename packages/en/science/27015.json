In order to render the issue of the present cheap edition\r\npossible, it has been found necessary to restrict its size a little by\r\nthe omission of chapters dealing with Glaciers, Ferns and Fern-seed,\r\nand the history of the Sea-squirts or Ascidians, which are contained\r\nin the original larger book. My hope is that this collection of\r\npapers, \"about a number of things,\" may meet with as kind a reception\r\nfrom my readers as that which they have accorded to its predecessors.\r\n\r\nE.

It is the case of the little girl of whom\r\nit is recorded that \"When she was good she was very good, and when she\r\nwas not she was horrid.\" This morning, after four days' misconduct,\r\nInterlaken was very good. The tremendous sun-blaze seemed to fill the\r\nvalleys with a pale blue luminous vapour, cut sharply by the shadows\r\nof steep hill-sides. Here and there the smoke of some burning weeds\r\nshowed up as brightest blue. Far away through the gap formed in the\r\nlong range of nearer mountains, where the Lütschine Valley opens into\r\nthe vale of Interlaken, the Jungfrau appeared in full majesty,\r\nabsolutely brilliant and unearthly. So I walked towards her up the\r\nvalley. Zweilütschinen is the name given to the spot where the valley\r\ndivides into two, that to the left leading up to Grindelwald, under\r\nthe shadow of the Mönch and the Wetterhorn, that to the right bringing\r\none to Lauterbrünnen and the Staubbach waterfall, with the snow-fields\r\nof the Tchingel finally closing the way--over which I climbed years\r\nago to Ried in the Loetschen Thal.\r\n\r\nThe autumn crocus was already up in many of the closely trimmed little\r\nmeadows, whilst the sweet scent of the late hay-crop spread from the\r\nnewly cut herbage of others.\r\n\r\nAt Zweilütschinen, where the white glacier-torrent unites with the\r\nblack, and the milky stream is nearly as cold as ice, and is boiling\r\nalong over huge rocks, its banks bordered with pine forest, I came\r\nupon a native fishing for trout. He was using a short rod and a\r\nweighted line with a small \"grub\" as bait. He dropped his line into\r\nthe water close to the steep bank, where some projecting rock or\r\nhalf-sunk boulder staved off the violence of the stream. He had\r\nalready caught half-a-dozen beautiful, red-spotted fish, which he\r\ncarried in a wooden tank full of water, with a close-fitting lid to\r\nprevent their jumping out. I saw him take a seventh. The largest must\r\nhave weighed nearly two pounds. It seems almost incredible that fish\r\nshould inhabit water so cold, so opaque, and so torrential, and should\r\nfind there any kind of nourishment. They make their way up by keeping\r\nclose to the bank, and are able, even in that milky current, to\r\nperceive and snatch the unfortunate worm or grub which has been washed\r\ninto the flood and is being hurried along at headlong speed. Only the\r\ntrout has the courage, strength, and love of nearly freezing water\r\nnecessary for such a life--no other fish ventures into such\r\nconditions. Trout are actually caught in some mountain pools at a\r\nheight of 8,000 ft., edged by perpetual snow.\r\n\r\nYou are rarely given trout to eat here in the hotels. A lake fish,\r\ncalled \"ferras,\" a large species of the salmonid genus _Coregonus_, to\r\nwhich the skelly, powan, and vendayce of British lakes belong, is the\r\ncommonest fish of the _table d'hôte_, and not very good. A better one\r\nis the perch-pike or zander. It is common in all the larger shallow\r\nlakes of Central Europe, and abounds in the \"broads\" which extend from\r\nPotsdam to Hamburg, though it is unknown in the British Isles. It is\r\nquite the best of the European fresh-water fish for the table, and\r\nthere should be no difficulty about introducing it into the Norfolk\r\nBroads. It would be worth an effort on the part of the Board of\r\nAgriculture and Fisheries to do so, as the perch-pike, unlike other\r\nfresh-water fishes, would hold its own on the market against haddock,\r\nbrill, and plaice. Another interesting fresh-water fish which grows to\r\na large size in the Lake of Geneva (where I have seen it netted) is\r\nthe burbot--called \"lote\" in French--a true cod of fresh-water habit\r\nwhich, though common throughout Europe and Northern Asia, is, in our\r\ncountry, only taken in a few rivers opening on the east coast. It is a\r\nbrilliantly coloured fish, orange-brown, mottled with black, and is\r\nvery good eating.\r\n\r\nPassing up the Lauterbrünnen valley, I came upon some wild raspberries\r\nand quantities of the fine, large-flowered sage, _Salvia glutinosa_,\r\nwith its yellow flowers, in shape like those of the dead-nettle, but\r\nmuch bigger. They were being visited by humble-bees, and I was able to\r\nsee the effective mechanism at work by which the bee's body is dusted\r\nwith the pollen of the flower. I have illustrated this in some\r\ndrawings (Fig. 1) which are accompanied by a detailed explanation. Two\r\nlong stamens, _a1_, arch high up over the lip of the flower, _li_, on\r\nwhich the bee alights, and are protected by a keel or hood of the\r\ncorolla. Each stamen is provided with a broad process, _a2_, standing\r\nout low down on its arched stalk, and blocking the way to the nectar\r\nin the cup of the flower. When the bee pushes his head against these\r\nobstacles and forces them backwards, the result is to swing the long\r\narched stalk, with its pollen sacks, in the opposite direction,\r\nnamely, forwards and downwards on to the bee's back. It was easy to\r\nsee this movement going on, and the consequent dusting of the bee's\r\nback with pollen. In somewhat older flowers, which have been relieved\r\nof their pollen, the style, _st._, or free stalk-like extremity of the\r\negg-holding capsule, already as long as the stamens, grows longer and\r\nbends down towards the lip or landing-place of the yellow flower. When\r\na pollen-dusted bee alights on one of these maturer flowers the sticky\r\nend of the now depending style is gently rubbed by the bee's back and\r\nsmeared with a few pollen-grains brought by the bee from a distant\r\nflower. These rapidly expand into \"pollen tubes,\" or filaments, and,\r\npenetrating the long style, reach the egg-germs below. Thus\r\ncross-fertilization is brought about by the bees which come for the\r\nnectar of _Salvia_. The stalks and outer parts of the flower of this\r\nplant produce a very sticky secretion which effectually prevents any\r\nsmall insects from crawling up and helping themselves to the nectar\r\nexclusively provided for the attraction of the humble-bee, whose\r\nservices are indispensable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--Diagrams of the flower of the yellow sage\r\n(_Salvia glutinosa_) a little larger than life. 1. An entire flower\r\nseen from the side. _st._ The stigma, _a2_. The pair of modified\r\nhalf-anthers which are pushed back by the bee when inserting its head\r\ninto the narrow part of the flower. 2. A similar flower at a later\r\nstage when the stigma, _st._, has grown downwards so as to touch the\r\nback of a bee alighting on the lip of the flower, and gather pollen\r\nfrom it. 3.

Then some children emerged\r\nfrom unsuspected lurking-places in the wood and offered bunches of\r\nedelweiss (Fig. 2). This curious-looking little plant does not grow\r\n(as pretended by reporters of mountaineering disasters) exclusively in\r\nplaces only to be reached by a dangerous climb. I have gathered it in\r\nmeadows on the hillside above Zermatt, and it is common enough in\r\naccessible spots. The flowers are like those of our English groundsel\r\nand yellow in colour--little \"composite\" knobs, each built up of many\r\ntubular \"florets\" packed side by side. Six or seven of these little\r\nshort-stalked knobs of florets are arranged in a circlet around a\r\nsomewhat larger knob, and each of them gives off from its stalk one\r\nlong and two shorter white, hairy, leaf-like growths, flat and\r\nblade-like in shape and spreading outwards from the circle, so that\r\nthe whole series resemble the rays of a star (or more truly of a\r\nstar-fish!). They look strangely artificial, as though cut out of new\r\nwhite flannel (with a greenish tint), and have been dignified\r\nby the comparison of the shape of the white-flannel rays with that\r\nof the foot of the lion and the claws of the eagle. They are\r\nextraordinary-looking little plants, and are similar in their\r\nhairiness and pale tint to some of the seaside plants on our own\r\ncoast, which, in fact, include species closely allied to them\r\n(\"cud-weeds\" of the genus _Gnaphalium_).\r\n\r\nThe huge cliffs of rocks on either side (in some parts over a thousand\r\nfeet in sheer height from the torrent) come closer to one another in\r\nthe part where we now are than in most Alpine valleys, so as almost to\r\ngive it the character of a \"gorge.\" At some points the highest part of\r\nthe precipice actually overhangs the perpendicular face by many feet.\r\nA refreshing cold air comes up from the icy torrent, whilst the heat\r\nof the sun diffuses the delicious resinous scent of the pine trees.\r\nAbove the naked rock we see steep hill-sides covered with forest, and\r\naway above these again bare grass-slopes topped by cloud. But as the\r\nclouds slowly lift and break we become suddenly aware of something\r\nimpending far above and beyond all this, something more dazzling in\r\nits white brightness than the sun-lit clouds, a form sharply cut in\r\noutline and firm, yet rounded by a shadow of an exquisite purple tint\r\nwhich no cloud can assume. The steely blue Alpine sky fits around this\r\nmarvel of pure whiteness as it towers through the opening cloud, and\r\nsoars out of earth's range. What is this glory so remote yet impending\r\nover us? It is the Jungfrau, the incomparable virgin of the ice-world,\r\nwho bares her snowy breast. She slowly parts her filmy veil, and, as\r\nwe gaze, uncovers all her loveliness.\r\n\r\nThe rock walls of the Lauterbrünnen valley show at one place a\r\nthickness of many hundred feet of strongly marked, perfectly\r\nhorizontal \"strata\"--the layers deposited immense ages ago at the\r\nbottom of a deep sea. Not only have they been raised to this position,\r\nand then cut into, so as to make the profound furrow or valley in the\r\nsides of which we see them, but they have been bent and contorted in\r\nplaces to an extent which is, at first sight, incredible. Close to one\r\ngreat precipice of orderly horizontal layers you see the whole series\r\nsuddenly turned up at right angles, and the same strata which were\r\nhorizontal have become perpendicular. But that is not the limit, for\r\nthe upturned strata are seen actually to turn right over, and again\r\nbecome horizontal in a reversed order, the strata which were the\r\nlowest becoming highest, and the highest lowest. The rock is rolled up\r\njust as a flat disc of Genoese pastry--consisting of alternate layers\r\nof jam and sponge-cake--is folded on itself to form a double\r\nthickness. The forces at work capable of treating the solid rocks, the\r\nfoundations of the great mountains, in this way are gigantic beyond\r\nmeasurement. This folding of the earth's crust is caused by the fact\r\nthat the \"crust,\" or skin of the earth, has ceased to cool, being\r\nwarmed by the sun, and therefore does not shrink, whilst the great\r\nwhite-hot mass within (in comparison with which the twenty-mile-thick\r\ncrust is a mere film) continually loses heat, and shrinks definitely\r\nin volume as its temperature sinks. The crust or jacket of stratified\r\nrock deposited by the action of the waters on the surface of the globe\r\nhas been compelled--at whatever cost, so to speak--to fit itself to\r\nthe diminishing \"core\" on which it lies. Slowly, but steadily, this\r\n\"settlement\" has gone on, and is going on. The horizontal rock layers,\r\nbeing now too great in length and breadth, adjust themselves by\r\n\"buckling\"--just as a too large, ill-fitting dress does--and the Alps,\r\nthe Himalayas, and other great mountain ranges, are regions where this\r\n\"buckling\" process has for countless ages proceeded, slowly but\r\nsurely. Probably the \"buckling\" has proceeded to a large extent\r\nwithout sudden movement, but with a lateral pressure of such power as\r\nultimately to throw a crust of thousands of feet thickness into deep\r\nfolds a mile or so in vertical measurement from crest to hollow,\r\nprotruding from the general level both upwards and downwards, whilst\r\noften the folds are rolled over on to each other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--Diagrams to show the \"folding\" of rock strata.\r\nA. Normal horizontal position of the strata, _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_; _xy_,\r\nhorizontal line. B. Folding due to a shortening of the horizontal _xy_\r\nby lateral pressure, acting in the direction of the arrow and due to\r\nshrinkage. C. More extreme case of folding, in which a raised ridge is\r\nmade to fall over so as to bring the lowest layer _d_ above _a_, _b_\r\nand _c_.]\r\n\r\nThis crumbling and folding has gone on at great depths--that is to\r\nsay, some miles below the surface (a mere nothing compared with the\r\n8,000 miles diameter of the globe itself), though we now see the\r\nresults exposed, like the pastry folded by a cook. Immense time has\r\nbeen taken in the process. A folding movement involving a vertical\r\nrise of an inch in ten years would not be noticed by human onlookers,\r\nbut in 600,000 years this would give you a vertical displacement of\r\nmore than 5,000 ft. (nearly a mile!). It has been shown that in\r\nSwitzerland, along a line of country extending from Basle to Milan,\r\nstrata of 10,000 ft. to 20,000 ft. in thickness, which, if\r\nstraightened out, would give a flat area of that thickness, and of 200\r\nmiles in length, have been buckled and folded so as to occupy only a\r\nlength of 130 miles! The former tight-fitting skin of horizontal rock\r\nlayers has \"had to\" buckle to that extent here (and in the same way in\r\nother mountain ranges in other parts of the world), because the whole\r\nterrestrial sphere has shrunk, owing to the gradual cooling of the\r\nmass, whilst the crust has not shrunk, not having lost heat.\r\n\r\nFilled with interest and delight in these things, I reached the\r\nrailway station at Lauterbrünnen, from whence the little train is\r\ndriven far up the mountain, even into the very heart of the Jungfrau,\r\nby an electric current generated by a turbine, itself driven by the\r\ntorrent at our feet, the waters of which have descended from the\r\nglaciers far above, to which it will carry us. In a few minutes I was\r\ngently gliding in the train up the to the \"Wengern Alp\" and the\r\n\"Little Scheidegg\"--a slope up which I have so often in former years\r\npainfully struggled on foot for four hours or more. One could to-day\r\nwatch the whole scene, in ease and comfort, during the two hours'\r\nascent of the train. And a marvellous scene it is as one rises to the\r\nheight of 8,000 ft., skirting the glaciers which ooze down the rocky\r\nsides of the Jungfrau, and mounting far above some of them. At the\r\nScheidegg I changed into a smaller train, and with some thirty\r\nfellow-passengers was carried higher and higher by the faithful,\r\nuntiring electric current. After a quarter of an hour's progress we\r\npaused high above the \"snout\" of the great Eiger glacier, and\r\ndescended by a short path on to it, examined the ice, its crevasses\r\nand layers, and its \"glacier-grains,\" and watched and heard an\r\navalanche. The last time I was here it took a couple of hours to reach\r\nthis spot from the Scheidegg, and probably neither I nor any of my\r\nfellow-passengers could to-day endure the necessary fatigue of\r\nreaching this spot on foot. Then we remounted the train, and on we\r\nwent into the solid rock of the huge Eiger. The train stops in the\r\nrock tunnel and we got out to look, through an opening cut in its\r\nside, down the sheer wall of the mountain on to the grassy meadows\r\nthousands of feet below.\r\n\r\nThen we start again, and on we are driven by the current generated\r\naway down there in Lauterbrünnen, through the spiral tunnel, mounting\r\na thousand feet more till we are landed at an opening cut on the\r\nfurther side of the rocky Eiger, which admits us to an actual footing\r\non the great glacier called the Eismeer, or Icelake. We lunch at a\r\nrestaurant cut out as a cavern in the solid rock, and survey the\r\nwondrous scene. We are now at a height of 10,000 feet, and in the real\r\nfrozen ice-world, hitherto accessible only to the young and vigorous.\r\nI have been there in my day with pain, danger, and labour, accompanied\r\nby guides and held up by ropes, but never till now with perfect ease\r\nand tranquillity and without \"turning a hair,\" or causing either man\r\nor beast to labour painfully on my behalf. We had taken two hours only\r\nfrom Lauterbrünnen; in former days we should have started in the small\r\nhours of the morning from the Scheidegg, and have climbed through many\r\ndangers for some six or seven hours before reaching this spot.\r\n\r\nI confess that I am not enchanted with all of the modern appliances\r\nfor saving time and labour--the telegraph, the telephone, the\r\nautomobile, and the aeroplane. But these mountain railways fill me\r\nwith satisfaction and gratitude. When the Jungfrau railway was first\r\nprojected, some athletic Englishmen with heavy boots and ice-axes,\r\nprotested against the \"desecration\" of regions till then accessible\r\nonly to them and to me, and others of our age and strength. They\r\ndeclared that the scenery would be injured by the railway and its\r\ntroops of \"tourists.\" As well might they protest against the\r\ndesecration caused by the crawling of fifty house-flies on the dome of\r\nSt. Paul's. These mountains and glaciers are so vast, and men with\r\ntheir railroads so small, that the latter are negligible in the\r\npresence of the former. No disfiguring effect whatever is produced by\r\nthese mountain railways; the trains have even ceased to emit smoke\r\nsince they were worked by electricity. I quite agree with those who\r\nobject to \"funiculars.\" The carriages on these are hauled up long,\r\nstraight gashes in the mountain side, which have a hideous and\r\ndisfiguring appearance. But I look forward with pleasure to the\r\ncompletion of the Jungfrau railway to the summit. I hope that the\r\nSwiss engineers will carry it through the mountain, and down along the\r\nside of the great Aletsch glacier to the Bel Alp and so to Brieg. That\r\nwould be a glorious route to the Simplon tunnel and Italy!\r\n\r\nI took three hours in the unwearied train descending from the Eismeer\r\nto Interlaken, and was back in my hotel in comfortable time for\r\ndinner, \"mightily content with the day's journey,\" as Mr. Pepys would\r\nhave said. I have always been sensitive to the action of diminished\r\npressure, which produces what is called \"mountain sickness\" in many\r\npeople. Many years ago I climbed by the glacier-pass known as the\r\nWeissthor from Macugnaga to the Riffel Alp, with a stylographic pen in\r\nmy pocket. The reservoir of the pen contained a little air, which\r\nexpanded as the atmospheric pressure diminished, and at 10,000 feet I\r\nfound most of the ink emptied into my pocket. Probably one cause of\r\nthe discomfort called \"mountain sickness\" arises from a similar\r\nexpansion of gas contained in the digestive canal, and in the\r\ncavities connected with the ear and nose. The more suddenly the change\r\nof pressure is effected, the more noticeable is the discomfort. But I\r\nwas rather pleased than otherwise to note, as I sat in the comfortable\r\nrailway carriage, that when we passed 8,000 feet in elevation the old\r\nfamiliar giddiness, and tendency to sigh and gasp, came upon me\r\nas of yore, as I gathered was the experience of some of my\r\nfellow-passengers: and when we were returning, and had descended\r\nhalf-way to Lauterbrünnen, I enjoyed the sense of restored ease in\r\nbreathing which I well remember when the whole experience was\r\ncomplicated by the fatigue of a long climb. A white-haired American\r\nlady was in the train with me ascending to the Eismeer. \"I have longed\r\nall my life,\" she said, \"to see a glaysher--to touch it and walk on\r\nit--and now I am going to do it at last. I and my daughter here have\r\ncome right away from America to go on these cars to the glaysher.\"\r\nWhen we were descending, I asked the old lady if she had been pleased.\r\n\"I can hardly speak of it rightly,\" she said. \"It seems to me as\r\nthough I have been standing up there on God's own throne.\" I do not\r\nsympathise with the Alpine monopolist who would grudge that dear old\r\nlady, and others like her, the little train and tramway by which alone\r\nsuch people can penetrate to those soul-stirring scenes. They are at\r\nleast as sensitive to the beauty of the mountains as are the most\r\nmuscular, most long-winded, and most sun-blistered of our friends--the\r\nacrobats of the rope and axe.\r\n\r\nInterlaken\r\n  _September, 1909_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nSWITZERLAND IN EARLY SUMMER\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is the early summer of 1910 and I have but just returned from a\r\nvisit to Switzerland. The latter part of June and the beginning of\r\nJuly is the best for a stay in that splendid and happy land if one is\r\na naturalist, and cares for the beauty of Alpine meadows, and of the\r\nflowers which grow among and upon the rocks near the great glaciers.\r\nThis year the weather has, no doubt, been exceptionally cold and wet,\r\nand at no great height (5,000 feet) we have had snow-storms, even in\r\nJuly. But as compared with that of Paris and London the weather has\r\nbeen delightful. There has been an abundance of magnificent sunshine,\r\nand many days of full summer heat and cloudless sky. A fortnight ago\r\n(July 16th), and on the day before, it was as hot and brilliant in the\r\nvalley of Chamonix as it can be. Mont Blanc and the Dome de Goutet\r\nstood out clear and immaculate against a purple-blue sky, and, as of\r\nold, we watched through the hotel telescope a party struggling, over\r\nthe snow to the highest peak.\r\n\r\nAt Chillon the lake of Geneva, day after day, spread out to us its\r\nlimitless surface of changing colour, now blending in one pearly\r\nexpanse with the sky--so that the distant felucca boats seemed to\r\nfloat between heaven and earth--now streaked with emerald and\r\namethystine bands. The huge mountain masses rising with a vast sweep\r\nfrom St. Jingo's shore displayed range after range of bloom-like greys\r\nand purples, whilst far away and above delicately glittered--like some\r\nincredible vision of a heavenly world beyond the sun-lit sky\r\nitself--the apparition of the snows and rocks of the great Dents du\r\nMidi. All this I have left behind me, and have passed back again to\r\ndull grey Paris, to the stormy Channel, and to the winter of London's\r\nJuly.\r\n\r\nThe incomparable pleasure which the lakes and valleys and mountains of\r\nSwitzerland are capable of giving is due to the combination of many\r\ndistinct sources of delight, each in itself of exceptional character.\r\nA month ago, in bright sunshine, I went, once again, by the little\r\nelectric railway (most blessed invention of our day) from the\r\npine-shaded torrent below to the great Eiger rock-mountain, and\r\nthrough its heart to the glacier beyond, more than 10,000 feet above\r\nsea-level. On the way back I left the train at the foot of the Eiger\r\nglacier, and walked down with my companion amongst the rocks of the\r\nmoraine and over the sparse turf of these highest regions of life.\r\nEverywhere was a profusion of gentians, the larger and darker, as well\r\nas the smaller, bluest of all blue flowers. The large, plump, yellow\r\nglobe-flowers (_Trollius_), the sulphur-yellow anemone, the glacial\r\nwhite-and-pink buttercup, the Alpine dryad, the Alpine forget-me-nots\r\nand pink primroses, the summer crocus, delicate hare-bells, and many\r\nother flowers of goodly size were abundant. The grass of Parnassus and\r\nthe edelweiss were not yet in flower, but lower down the slopes the\r\nAlpine rhododendron was showing its crimson bunches of blossom. It is\r\na pity that the Swiss call this plant \"Alpenrose,\" since there is a\r\ntrue and exquisite Alpine rose (which we often found) with deep red\r\nflowers, dark-coloured foliage, and a rich, sweet-briar perfume.\r\nLovely as these larger flowers of the higher Alps are, they are\r\nexcelled in fascination by the delicate blue flowers of the\r\nSoldanellas, like little fringed foolscaps, by the brilliant little\r\nred and purple Alpine snap-dragon, and by the cushion-forming growths\r\nof saxifrages and other minute plants which encrust the rocks and\r\nbear, closely set in their compact, green, velvet-like foliage, tiny\r\nflowers as brilliant as gems. A ruby-red one amongst these is \"the\r\nstalkless bladder-wort\" (_Silene acaulis_), having no more resemblance\r\nat first sight to the somewhat ramshackle bladder-wort of our fields\r\nthan a fairy has to a fishwife. There are many others of these\r\ncushion-forming, diminutive plants, with white, blue, yellow, and pink\r\nflorets. Examined with a good pocket lens, they reveal unexpected\r\nbeauties of detail--so graceful and harmonious that one wonders that\r\nno one has made carefully coloured pictures of them of ten times the\r\nsize of nature, and published them for all the world to enjoy. Busily\r\nmoving within their charmed circles we see, with our lens, minute\r\ninsects which, attracted by the honey, are carrying the pollen of one\r\nflower to another, and effecting for these little pollen flowers what\r\nbees and moths do for the larger species.\r\n\r\nThus we are reminded that all this loveliness, this exquisite beauty,\r\nis the work of natural selection--the result of the survival of\r\nfavourable variations in the struggle for existence. These minute\r\nsymmetrical forms, this wax-like texture, these marvellous rows of\r\ncoloured, enamel-like encrustation, have been selected from almost\r\nendless and limitless possible variations, and have been accumulated\r\nand maintained there as they are in all their beauty, by survival of\r\nthe fittest--by natural selection. All beauty of living things, it\r\nseems, is due to Nature's selection, and not only all beauty of colour\r\nand form, but that beauty of behaviour and excellence of inner quality\r\nwhich we call \"goodness.\" The fittest, that which has survived and\r\nwill survive in the struggle of organic growth, is (we see it in these\r\nflowers) in man's estimation the beautiful. Is it possible to doubt\r\nthat just as we approve and delightedly revel in the beauty created by\r\n\"natural selection,\" so we give our admiration and reverence, without\r\nquestion, to \"goodness,\" which also is the creation of Nature's great\r\nunfolding? Goodness (shall we say virtue and high quality?) is, like\r\nbeauty, the inevitable product of the struggle of living things, and\r\nis Nature's favourite no less than man's desire. When we know the ways\r\nof Nature, we shall discover the source and meaning of beauty, whether\r\nof body or of mind.\r\n\r\nAs these thoughts are drifting through our enchanted dream we suddenly\r\nhear a deep and threatening roar from the mountain-side. We look up\r\nand see an avalanche falling down the rocks of the Jungfrau. The vast\r\nmountain, with its dazzling vestment of eternal snow, and its slowly\r\ncreeping, green-fissured glaciers, towers above into the cloudless\r\nsky. In an instant the mind travels from the microscopic details of\r\norganic beauty, which but a moment ago held it entranced, to the\r\ncontemplation of the gigantic and elemental force whose tremendous\r\nwork is even now going on close to where we stand. The contrast, the\r\nrange from the minute to the gigantic, is prodigious yet exhilarating,\r\nand strangely grateful. How many millions of years did it take to form\r\nthose rocks (many of them are stratified, water-laid deposits) in the\r\ndepths of the ocean? How many more to twist and bend them and raise\r\nthem to their present height? And what inconceivably long persistence\r\nof the wear and tear of frost and snow and torrent has it required to\r\nexcavate in their hard bosoms these deep, broad valleys thousands of\r\nfeet below us, and to leave these strangely moulded mountain peaks\r\nstill high above us? And that beauty of the sun-lit sky and of the\r\nbillowy ice-field and of the colours of the lake below and of the\r\nluminous haze and the deep blue shade in the valley--how is that\r\nrelated to the beauty of the flowers? Truly enough, it is not a beauty\r\ncalled forth by natural selection. It is primordial; it is the beauty\r\nof great light itself. The response to its charm is felt by every\r\nliving thing, even by the smallest green plant and the invisible\r\nanimalcule, as it is by man himself. As I stand on the mountain-side\r\nwe are all, from animalcule to man, sympathizing and uniting, as\r\nmembers of one great race, in our adoration of the sun. And in doing\r\nthis we men are for the moment close to and in happy fellowship with\r\nour beautiful, though speechless, relatives who also live. Even the\r\ndestructive bacteria which are killed by the sun probably enjoy an\r\nexquisite shudder in the process which more than compensates them for\r\ntheir extinction.\r\n\r\nThe pleasures of flower-seeking in Switzerland are by no means\r\nconfined to the great heights. At moderate heights (4,000 to 5,000\r\nfeet) you have the Alpine meadows, and below those the rich-soiled\r\nwoods which fill in the sides of the torrent-worn valleys. You cannot\r\nsee an Alpine meadow after July, as it is cut down by then. It is at\r\nits best in June. It bears very little grass, and consists almost\r\nentirely of flowers. In places the hare-bells and Canterbury bells and\r\nthe bugloss are so abundant as to make a whole valley-floor blue as in\r\nMacWhirter's picture. But more often the blue is intermixed with the\r\nballs of, red clover and the spikes of a splendid pale pink polygonum\r\n(a sort of buckwheat) and of a very large and handsome plantain. Large\r\nyellow gentians, mulleins, the nearly black and the purple orchids,\r\nvetches of all colours, the Alpine clover with four or five enormous\r\nflowers in a head instead of fifty little ones, the Astrantias (like a\r\ncircular brooch made up of fifty gems each mounted on a long elastic\r\nwire and set vibrating side by side), the sky-blue forget-me-nots, and\r\nthe golden potentillas, are usually components of the Alpine meadow.\r\nAt Murren, and no doubt commonly elsewhere, there are a few very\r\nbeautiful grasses among the flowers, but the most remarkable grass is\r\none (_Poa alpina_), which has on every spikelet or head a bright green\r\nserpent-like streamer. Each of these \"streamers\" is, in fact, a young\r\ngrass-plant, budded off \"viviparously,\" as it is called, from the\r\nflower-head, or \"spikelet,\" and having nothing to do with the proper\r\nfertilized seed or grain. The young plants so budded fall to the\r\nground, and striking root rapidly, grow into separate individuals. It\r\nis probably owing to some condition in Alpine meadows adverse to the\r\nproduction of fertilized seed that this viviparous method of\r\nreproduction has been favoured, since it occurs also in an Alpine\r\nmeadow-plant allied to the buckwheat, namely, _Polygonum viviparum_\r\n(not the kind mentioned above), where the lower flowers are converted\r\ninto little red bulbs, by which the plant propagates. Both the\r\nviviparous grass and the polygonum are found in England. In fact, a\r\nvery large proportion of Alpine plants occur in parts of the British\r\nislands (a legacy from the glacial period), though many which are\r\nabundant in Switzerland are rare and local here.\r\n\r\nAt a lower level, in the woods, we come upon other plants, not really\r\n\"Alpine\" at all, but of great and special beauty. We found four kinds\r\nof winter-green (_Pirola_), one with a very large, solitary flower,\r\nwhite and wax-like, and the beautiful white butterfly-orchid with\r\nnectaries three quarters of an inch long, and other large-flowered\r\norchids. We were anxious to find the noble Martagon lily, and hunted\r\nin many glades and forest borders for it. At last, concealed on a bank\r\nin a wood, between Glion and Les Avants, it revealed itself in\r\nquantity, many specimens standing over three feet in height. Martagon\r\nis an Arabic word, signifying a Turkish cap. A very strange and\r\nuncanny-looking lily, which I had never seen before, turned up near\r\nKandersteg at the Blue Lake, beloved of Mr. H. G. Wells. This is \"the\r\nHerb Paris.\" It has four narrow outstretched green sepals, and four\r\nstill narrower green petals, eight large stamens, and a purple seed\r\ncapsule. Its broad oval leaves are also arranged in whorls of four.\r\nIts name has nothing to do with the \"ville lumière,\" nor with the\r\nTrojan judge of female beauty, but refers to the symmetry and \"parity\"\r\nof its component parts. I was not surprised to find that \"the Herb\r\nParis\" is poisonous, and was anciently used in medicine. It looks\r\nweird and deadly.\r\n\r\nMarmots, glacier fleas (spring-tails, not true fleas), admirable\r\ntrout, and burbot (the fresh-water cod, called \"lote\" in French),\r\noutrageous wood-gnats, which English people call by a Portuguese name\r\nas soon as they are on the Continent, and singing birds (usually one\r\nis too late in the season to hear them) were our zoological\r\naccompaniment. There were singularly few butterflies or other insects,\r\nprobably in consequence of the previous wet weather.\r\n\r\n_July, 1909_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nGLETSCH\r\n\r\n\r\nVaried and uncertain as the weather was in Switzerland during July of\r\nthe year 1910, it showed a more decided character when I returned\r\nthere at the end of August. For three weeks there was no flood of\r\nsunshine, no blazing of a cloudless blue sky, which is the one\r\ncondition necessary to the perfection of the beauty of Swiss\r\nmountains, valleys and lakes. The Oberland was grey and shapeless, the\r\nLauterbrünnen valley chilly and threatening; even the divine Jungfrau\r\nherself, when not altogether obliterated by the monotonous,\r\nimpenetrable cloud, loomed in steely coldness--\"a sterile promontory.\"\r\nCrossing the mountains from the Lake of Thun, we came to Montreux,\r\nonly to find the pearl-like surface of the great Lake Leman\r\ntransformed into lead. Not once in eight days did the celestial\r\nfortress called Les Dents du Midi reveal its existence, although we\r\nknew it was there, immensely high and remote, far away above the great\r\nbuttresses of the Rhone valley. So completely was it blotted out by\r\nthe conversion of that most excellent canopy, the air, into a foul and\r\npestilent congregation of vapours, that it was difficult to imagine\r\nthat it was still existing, and perhaps even glowing in sunshine above\r\nthe pall of cloud. Italy, surely, we thought, would be free from this\r\ndreadful gloom.\r\n\r\nThe southern slopes of the Alps are often cloudless when the colder\r\nnorthern valleys are overhung with impenetrable mist. In four hours\r\nyou can pass now from the Lake of Geneva through the hot Simplon\r\nTunnel to the Lago Maggiore. So, hungering for sunshine, we packed,\r\nand ran in the ever-ready train through to Baveno. Thirty years ago we\r\nshould have had to drive over the Simplon--a beautiful drive, it is\r\ntrue--but we should have taken sixteen hours in actually travelling\r\nfrom Montreux, and have had to pass a night _en route_ at Brieg! A\r\ntreacherous gleam of sunshine lasting half an hour welcomed us on\r\nemerging from the Simplon tunnel, and then for eight days the same\r\nleaden aspect of sky, mountain, and lake as that which we had left in\r\nSwitzerland was maintained. Even this could not spoil altogether the\r\nbeauty and interest of the fine old garden of the Borromeo family on\r\nthe Isola Bella. Really big cypress trees, magnificent specimens of\r\nthe Weymouth pine--the white pine of the United States, _Pinus\r\nstrobus_, first brought from the St. Lawrence in 1705, and planted in\r\nWiltshire by Lord Weymouth--a splendid camphor tree, strange varieties\r\nof the hydrangea, and many other old-fashioned shrubs adorn the quaint\r\nand well-designed terraces of that seat of ancient peace. The granite\r\nquarries close behind Baveno, and the cutting and chiselling of the\r\ngranite by a population of some 2,000 quarrymen and stonemasons, were\r\nnot deprived of their human interest by rain and skies more grey than\r\nthe granite itself. But, at last, we gave up Italy in despair,\r\nretreated through the tunnel one morning, and an hour after mid-day\r\nwere careering in a carriage along the Rhone valley--with jingling of\r\nbells and much cracking of a harmless whip--upwards on a drive of\r\nseven hours to the Rhone glacier, to the hotel called \"Gletsch,\"\r\nstaking all on the last chance of a change in the weather.\r\n\r\nWe passed the enclosed meadow near Brieg, whence three days later the\r\nsplendidly daring South-American aviator started on his flight across\r\nthe Alps, only to die after victory--a hero, whose courage and fatal\r\ntriumph were worthy of a better cause. After some hours, passing many\r\na black-timbered mountain village--the houses of which, set on stone\r\npiles, are the direct descendants of the pile-supported lake dwellings\r\nof the Stone Age on the shores of the Lake of Neuchatel--we came to\r\nthe upper and narrower part of the valley. The road ascended by\r\nzig-zags through pine forests, in which the large blue gentian, with\r\nflowers and leaves in double rows on a gracefully bowed stem, were\r\nabundant. In open places the barberry, with its dense clusters of\r\ncrimson fruit, was so abundant as actually to colour the landscape,\r\nwhilst a huge yellow mullen nearly as big as a hollyhock, and bright\r\nAlpine \"pinks,\" were there in profusion. Before the night fell, a\r\nlong, furry animal, twice the size of a squirrel, and of dark brown\r\ncolour, crossed the road with a characteristic undulating movement, a\r\nfew feet in front of our carriage. It was a pine-marten, the largest\r\nof the weasel and pole-cat tribe, still to be found in our own north\r\ncountry. It must not be confused with the paler beech-marten of Anne\r\nof Brittany, which often takes up its abode in the roofs of Breton\r\nhouses, according to my own experience in Dinard and the\r\nneighbourhood. Night fell, and our horses were still toiling up the\r\nmountain road. Impenetrable chasms lay below, and vast precipices\r\nabove us. We crossed a bridge, and seemed in the darkness to plunge\r\ninto the sheer rock itself, and, though thrilled with a delightful\r\nsense of mystery and awe, were feeling a little anxiety at the\r\nprospect of another hour among these gloomy, intangible dangers, when\r\nwe rounded a projecting rock, and suddenly a brilliant constellation\r\nburst into view in the sky. It was the electric outfit of the\r\nBelvedere Hotel, 7,500 feet above the sea, and far up more than a\r\nthousand feet above us and the glacier's snout. In another minute the\r\ngreat arc lamps of the Gletsch Hotel, close to us, blazed forth, and\r\nwe were welcomed into its snug hall and warmed by the great log-fire\r\nburning on its hospitable hearth.\r\n\r\nThe next day we were early afoot in the most brilliant sunshine, under\r\na cloudless sky--really perfect Alpine weather. In the shade the\r\npersisting night-frost told of the great height of the marvellous\r\namphitheatre which lay before us. The valley by which we had mounted\r\nthe previous night abruptly abandons its steep gradient and gorge-like\r\ncharacter, and widens into a flat, boulder-strewn plain, a little over\r\na mile in diameter, surrounded, except for the narrow gap by which we\r\nhad entered, by the steep, rocky sides of huge mountains. At the far\r\nend of the plain, a mile off, the great Rhone glacier comes toppling\r\nover the precipice, a snowy white, frozen cascade of a thousand feet\r\nin height. It looks even nearer than it is, and the gigantic teeth of\r\nwhite ice at the top of the fall seem no bigger than sentry-boxes,\r\nthough we know they are more nearly the size of church steeples. The\r\ncelebrated Furca road zig-zags up the mountain side for a thousand\r\nfeet close to the glacier, and when you drive up it and reach the\r\nheight of the Belvedere, you can step on to the ice close to the road.\r\nThen you can mount on to the flat, unbroken surface of the broad\r\nglacier stream above the fall, and trace the glacier to the\r\nsnow-covered mountain-tops in which it originates. There is no such\r\nclose and intimate view of a glacier to be had elsewhere in Europe by\r\nthe traveller in diligence or carriage. We walked by the side of the\r\ninfant Rhone, among the pebbles and boulders, to the overhanging snout\r\nof the great glacier from beneath which the river emerges. A very\r\nbeautiful wine-red species of dwarf willow-herb (_Epilobium\r\nFleischeri_) was growing abundantly in tufts among the pebbles, and\r\nmany other Alpine plants greeted our eyes. The heat of the sun was\r\nthat of midsummer, whilst a delicate air of icy freshness diffused\r\nitself from the great frozen mass in front of us.\r\n\r\nSome large blocks of the glacier ice had fallen from above, and lay\r\nconveniently for examination. Whilst the walls of the ice-caves which\r\nhave been cut into this and other glaciers present a perfectly smooth,\r\ncontinuous surface of clear ice, these fragments which had fallen from\r\nthe surface exposed to the heat of the sun, were, as seen in the mass,\r\nwhite and opaque. When a stick was thrust into the mass, it broke into\r\nmany-sided lumps of the size of a tennis-ball, which separated, and\r\nfell apart in a heap, like assorted coals thrown from a scuttle,\r\nthough white instead of black. These were the curious glacier nodules,\r\n\"grains du glacier,\" or \"Gletcherkörne,\" characteristic of glacier ice\r\nas contrasted with lake ice. This structure of the glacier ice is\r\npeculiar to it, and is only made evident where the sun's rays\r\npenetrate it and melt the less pure ice which holds together the\r\ncrystalline nodules. According to Dr. J. Young Buchanan, these nodules\r\nare masses of ice crystals comparatively free from mineral matter,\r\nwhilst the water around them, which freezes less readily, contains\r\nmineral impurities in solution. The presence of saline matter in\r\nsolution lowers, in proportion to its amount, the freezing-point of\r\nthe water. Accordingly, although frozen into one solid mass with the\r\nnodules, the cementing ice melts under the heat of the penetrating\r\nrays of the sun sooner--that is, at a lower temperature--than do the\r\npurer crystalline nodules, and allows them to separate. It is owing to\r\nthis that the exposed surface of glacier ice is white and powdery,\r\ndisintegrated by the superficial heat, and forming a rough surface, on\r\nwhich one can safely walk. Lake ice does not break up in this manner\r\nunder the sun's rays, but as it melts retains its smooth, slippery\r\nsurface. It is formed in water, and not from the cementing and\r\nregelation of the powdery crystalline snow, as is glacier ice.\r\n\r\nPictures of the Rhone glacier published in the year 1820 and in the\r\neighteenth century show that in old days the terminal ice-fall did not\r\nend abruptly in a narrowed \"snout,\" as it does now, but spread out\r\ninto a very broad half-dome or fan-shaped, apron-like expanse, some\r\n700 feet high and a quarter of a mile broad at the base. It was\r\nconsidered one of the wonders of Switzerland, and was pictured in an\r\nexaggerated way in travellers' books. In 1873, when I first drove down\r\nthe Furka road and saw the Rhone glacier, this wonderful, apron-like,\r\nterminal expansion of the glacier was still in existence. It has now\r\ncompletely disappeared. In those days, and for many years later, there\r\nwas only a mule-path over the adjacent Grimsel Pass, but now there is\r\na carriage road leading out of the Rhone glacier's basin northwards to\r\nMeiringen, whilst the old-established Furka road, at the other side of\r\nthe amphitheatre, leads eastward to Andermatt, the St. Gothard, and\r\nthe Lake of Lucerne. Hence three great roads now meet at Gletsch.\r\nBefore leaving this wondrous spot we inspected some plump marmots, who\r\nwere leading a happy life of ease and plenty in a large cage erected\r\nin front of the hotel; then in absolutely perfect weather we mounted\r\nthe Grimsel road. We heard the frequent whistling of uncaged marmots\r\nas we ascended, and saw many of the little beasts sitting up on the\r\nrocks and diving into concealing crevices as we approached, just as do\r\ntheir smaller but closely allied cousins the prairie marmots\r\n(so-called \"prairie dogs\") of North America. The view, as one ascends\r\nthe Grimsel, of the snow-peaks around Gletsch is a fine one in itself,\r\nbut is vastly enhanced in beauty by the plunge downwards of the rocky\r\ngorge made by the Rhone as it leaves the flat-bottomed amphitheatre of\r\nits birth. The top of the Grimsel Pass, which is a little over 7,000\r\nfeet above sea-level, is the most desolate and bare of all such\r\nmountain passes. The rock is dark grey, almost black, and of unusually\r\nhard character. It is unstratified, and so resistant that it is\r\neverywhere worn into smooth, rounded surfaces, instead of being\r\nsplintered and shattered. A small, black-looking lake at the top of\r\nthe pass contains to this day the bones of 500 Austrians and French\r\nwho fought here in 1799. It is called the Totensee, or Dead Men's\r\nLake. At this point one stands on a great watershed, dividing the\r\nrivers of the north from the rivers of the south. You may put one foot\r\nin a rivulet which is carrying water down the Aar Valley, and through\r\nthe Lakes of Brienz and of Thun to the Rhine and North Sea, whilst you\r\nkeep the other in another little stream, whose particles will pass by\r\nthe Rhone gorge and valley through the Lake of Geneva to the great\r\nRhone and the Mediterranean. Three incomparably fine days--September\r\n17th, 18th, and 19th--atoned for three weeks of sunless cloud. One of\r\nthem we spent in the high valley of Rosenlaui, where are hairy-lipped\r\ngentians and the blue-iced glacier, but of these I have not space to\r\ntell. Then the clouds and the rain resumed their odious domination,\r\nand we left Lucerne and its lakes invisible, overwhelmed in grey fog,\r\nand made for Paris.\r\n\r\n_October, 1910_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE PROBLEM OF THE GALLOPING HORSE\r\n\r\n\r\nUntil instantaneous photography was introduced, a little more than\r\ntwenty-five years ago (by the discovery of the means of increasing the\r\nsensitiveness of a photographic plate), and gradually became familiar\r\nto everyone in the exhibitions known as the \"biograph\" or\r\n\"cinematograph,\" the actual position of the legs in a galloping horse\r\nat any given fraction of a second was unknown. Anyone who has tried to\r\n\"see\" their position will agree that it cannot be done. Attempts had\r\nbeen made to make out what the movements and positions of the legs\r\n\"must\" be, by studying the hoof-marks in a soft track laid for the\r\npurpose. But the result was not satisfactory.\r\n\r\nAs everyone knows, the so-called \"biograph\" pictures are produced by\r\nan enormous series of consecutive instantaneous photographs taken on a\r\ncontinuous transparent flexible film or ribbon. The camera has a\r\nmechanism attached to it by which the sensitive film is jerked along\r\nso as to expose a length of two inches (the size of the picture given\r\nby the camera) for, say, one-thirtieth of a second without movement.\r\nThe film is then jerked on and a second bit of two inches is brought\r\ninto place for a thirtieth of a second and so on until a ribbon of\r\nsome thousand pictures is obtained. The interval between each picture\r\nis usually also about one-thirtieth of a second, so that at least\r\nfifteen pictures are taken in every second of time, and according to\r\nthe requirements of illumination and the rapidity of the movements of\r\nthe men or animals photographed this number may be greatly increased.\r\nThe film is developed, printed and fixed on a similar rolling\r\nmechanism and the pictures are thrown one by one by a powerful\r\nlantern on to a screen, and are jerked along at the same rate as that\r\nat which they were taken, and are magnified enormously. Animals and\r\nmen in rapid movement, railway trains, the waves of the sea are thus\r\nphotographed, and when the serial pictures are thrown successively on\r\nthe screen the result is that the eye detects no interval between the\r\nsuccessive pictures--the figures appear as continuous moving objects.\r\nThis is due to the fact that whilst the impression produced on the\r\nretina of the eye by each picture lasts for a tenth of a second (less\r\nwith brighter light), the interval between the successive pictures is\r\nonly one-thirtieth of a second, and accordingly the retinal impression\r\nhas not gone or ceased before the next is there; hence there is no\r\nbreak in the series of retinal impressions, but continuity.[1]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate I.--Figs. 1 to 11, drawings from Muybridge's\r\nphotographs of consecutive poses of the galloping horse, each\r\nphotograph taken by an exposure of one fortieth of a second and\r\nseparated from the next by an interval of one fortieth of a second.\r\nThe horse in Fig. 10 has returned to the same pose as that with which\r\nthe series starts in Fig. 1. Fig. 11 gives a pose one hundredth of a\r\nsecond earlier in the series than that taken in Fig. 2. Fig. 12 shows\r\na combination of the hinder half of Fig. 9 with the front half of Fig.\r\n6, giving thus the maximum extension of both fore and hind legs.]\r\n\r\nIt is this duration of the impression on the retina which prevents us\r\nfrom separating or \"seeing distinctly\" the successive phases of a\r\nhorse's legs as he gallops by, and has led to the remarkable result\r\nthat no artist has ever until twenty-five years ago represented\r\ncorrectly any one phase of the movement of the legs in a galloping\r\nhorse, and it is doubtful whether that correctness is what the painter\r\nof a picture really ought to put on his canvas. If we examine the\r\nseparate pictures of a galloping horse as taken on a cinematograph\r\nfilm, we have before us the actual record of the positions assumed by\r\nthe legs at intervals of the thirtieth of a second (or whatever less\r\ninterval and length of exposure may have been chosen), and it is\r\nsimply astonishing to find how utterly different they are from what\r\nhad been supposed. Twenty years ago Mr. Muybridge produced a number\r\nof these instantaneous photographs of moving animals--such as the\r\nhorse in gallop, trot, canter, amble, walk, and jumping and\r\nbucking--also the dog running, birds of several kinds flying, camel,\r\nelephant, deer, and other animals in rapid movement. The animals were\r\nphotographed on a track in front of a wall, marked out to show\r\nmeasured yards; the time was accurately recorded to show rate\r\nof movement and length of exposure, and of interval between\r\nsuccessive pictures. By means of three cameras worked by electric\r\nshutter-openers, a side, a back, and a front view of the animal were\r\ntaken simultaneously. Repeated photographs were obtained at intervals\r\nof a fraction of a second, giving a series of fifteen or twenty\r\npictures of the moving animal. The length of exposure for each picture\r\nwas one-fortieth of a second or less, and the interval between\r\nsuccessive pictures was about the same. Muybridge's great difficulty\r\nhad been to invent a shutter which would act rapidly enough. I have\r\nsome of these pictures before me now (see Pl. I). They show that what\r\nhas been drawn by artists and called the \"flying gallop,\" in which the\r\nlegs are fully extended and all the feet are off the ground, with the\r\nhind hoofs turned upwards, never occurs at all in the galloping horse,\r\nnor anything in the least like it. There is a fraction of a second\r\nwhen all four legs of the galloping horse are off the ground, but they\r\nare not then extended, but, on the contrary, are drawn, the hind ones\r\nforward and the front ones backward, under the horses' belly (see Pl.\r\nI, figs. 2 and 3). A model showing this actual instantaneous attitude\r\nof the galloping horse has recently been placed in the Natural History\r\nMuseum. When the hoofs touch the ground again after this instantaneous\r\nlifting and bending of the legs under the horse, the first to touch it\r\nis that of one of the hind legs (Pl. I, fig. 4), which is pushed very\r\nfar forward, forming an acute angle with the body. The shock of the\r\nhorse's impact on the ground is thus received by the hind leg, which\r\nreaches obliquely forward beneath the body like an elastic <- spring.\r\nSince the instantaneous photographs have become generally known\r\nartists have ceased to represent the galloping horse in the curious\r\nstretched pose which used to be familiar to everyone in Herring's\r\nracing plates (see Pl. II, fig. 1), with both fore and hind legs\r\nnearly horizontal, and the flat surface of the hind hoofs actually\r\nturned upwards! Indeed, as early as 1886 a French painter, M. Aimé\r\nMorot, availed himself of the information afforded by the then quite\r\nnovel instantaneous photographs of the galloping horse, and exhibited\r\na picture of the cavalry fight at Rezonville between the French and\r\nGermans, in which the old flying gallop does not appear, but the\r\nattitudes of the horses are those revealed by the new photographs. The\r\npicture is an epoch-making one, whether justifiable or not, and is now\r\nin the gallery of the Luxembourg. It must be noted that though\r\nMeissonier and others had succeeded in representing more truthfully\r\nthan had been customary, other movements of the horse, such as\r\n\"pacing,\" ambling, cantering, and trotting, yet in regard to them,\r\nalso, more easily observed because less rapid, the instantaneous\r\nphotograph served to correct erroneous conclusions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate II.--Various representations of the gallop.

Conventional Gallop\r\n\r\nFig. 6.]\r\n\r\nTwo very interesting questions arise in connection with the discovery\r\nby instantaneous photography of the actual positions successively\r\ntaken up by the legs of a galloping horse. The first is one of\r\nhistorical and psychological importance, viz. why and when did artists\r\nadopt the false but generally accepted attitude of the \"flying\r\ngallop\"? The second is psychological and also physiological, viz. if\r\nwe admit that the true instantaneous phases of the horse's gallop (or\r\nof any other very rapid movement of anything) cannot be seen\r\nseparately by the human eye, but can only be separated by\r\ninstantaneous photography, ought an artist to introduce into a\r\npicture, which is not intended to serve merely as a scientific\r\ndiagram, an appearance which has no actual existence so far as his or\r\nother human eyes are concerned, viz. that of the actual pose assumed\r\ninstantaneously and simultaneously by the four legs of the galloping\r\nhorse? And further, if he ought not to do this, what ought he to do,\r\non the supposition that his purpose is to convey to others the same\r\nimpression of rapid movement which exists--not, be it observed, in his\r\neye, or on the retina of that eye--but in his mind, as the result of\r\nattention and judgment?\r\n\r\nThe first of these questions has been answered by the great French\r\nauthority on archæology and the history of art, M. Salomon Reinach,[2]\r\nwhose writings are as lucid and terse as they are accurate, and\r\nsolidly based on research. M. Reinach shows (and produces drawings to\r\nsupport his statement) that in Assyrian, Egyptian, Greek, Roman,\r\nmediæval, and modern art up to the end of the eighteenth century \"the\r\nflying gallop\" does not appear at all! The first example (so far as\r\nthose schools are concerned) is an engraving by G. T. Stubbs in 1794\r\nof a horse called \"Baronet.\" The essential points about \"the flying\r\ngallop\" are that the fore-limbs are fully stretched forward, the hind\r\nlimbs fully stretched backward, and that the flat surfaces of the\r\nhinder hoofs are facing upwards. After this engraving of 1794 the\r\nattitude introduced by Stubbs became generally adopted in English art\r\nto represent a galloping horse, and the French painter, Géricault,\r\nintroduced it into France in 1821 in his celebrated picture, the\r\n\"Derby d'Epsom,\" (see Pl. II, fig. 1) which is now in the Louvre.\r\n\r\nPreviously to this there had been three other conventional poses for\r\nthe running horse in art, of which only the third (to be mentioned\r\nbelow) has any resemblance to a real pose, and that not one of rapid\r\nmovement. We find: (1) The elongated or stretched-leg \"prance\"\r\n(French, \"_cabré allongé_\"), in which, whilst the front legs are off\r\nthe ground, and all four legs are stretched nearly as much as in the\r\nflying gallop, there is this essential difference, viz. that the hoofs\r\nof the hind legs are firmly planted on the ground (see Pl. II, fig.\r\n7). This pose is seen in a picture by the same artist (Stubbs) of two\r\nyears' earlier date than that in which he introduced \"the flying\r\ngallop.\" The \"stretched-leg prance\" is found in Egyptian works (Pl.\r\nII, fig. 8) of 580 B.C., and is a favourite pose to indicate the\r\ngallop, in ancient Assyrian as well as mediæval art, for instance, in\r\nthe Bayeux tapestry (Pl. II, fig. 6). We find, further, (2) that the\r\nsecond pose made use of for this purpose is the \"flexed-leg prance,\"\r\nin which all the four legs are flexed, so that the hind legs rest on\r\nthe ground beneath the horse's body, whilst the forelegs \"paw\" the\r\nair. This is seen both in Egyptian, Greek, and Renaissance art\r\n(Leonardo, Raphael, and Velasquez). It is by no means so graceful or\r\ntrue to Nature as the next pose, but gives an impression of greater\r\nenergy and rapidity. The third pose represents a kind of \"prancing,\"\r\nand is seen on the frieze of the Parthenon (Pl. III, fig. 4), and in\r\nmany subsequent Greek, Roman, and other works copied from or inspired\r\nby, this Greek original. One only of the hind legs is on the ground,\r\nand the animal's body is thrown up as though its advance were checked\r\nby the rein. It is called \"the canter\" by M. Reinach, but that term\r\ncan only be applied to it when the axis of the body is horizontal and\r\nparallel to the surface of the ground.\r\n\r\nThe reader will perhaps now suppose that we must attribute the \"flying\r\ngallop\" to the original, if inaccurate genius of an eighteenth century\r\nEnglish horse-painter. That, however, is not the case. M. Reinach has\r\nshown that it has a much more extraordinary history. It is neither\r\nmore nor less than the fact that in the pre-Homeric art of\r\nGreece--that which is called \"Mycenæan\" (of which so much was made\r\nknown by the discoveries of that wonderful man Schliemann when he dug\r\nup the citadel of Agamemnon)--the figures of animals, horses, deer,\r\nbulls (see the beautiful gold cups of Vaphio), dogs, lions, and\r\ngriffins, in the exact conventional pose of \"the flying gallop,\" are\r\nquite abundant! (See Pl. II, figs. 2, 3 and 4.) There was an absolute\r\nbreak in the tradition of art between the early gold-workers of Mykené\r\n(1800 to 1000 B.C.) and the Greeks of Homer's time (800 B.C.). Europe\r\nnever received it, nor did the Assyrians nor the Egyptians. Thirty\r\ncenturies and more separate the reappearance in Europe of the flying\r\ngallop--through Stubbs--from the only other European examples of\r\nit--the Mycenæan. What, then, had become of it, and how did it come to\r\nEngland? M. Reinach shows, by actual specimens of art-work, that the\r\nMycenæan art tradition, and with it the \"flying gallop,\" passed slowly\r\nthrough Asia Minor north eastwards to the Trans-caucasus (Koban, 500\r\nB.C.), to Northern Persia, and thence by Southern Siberia to the\r\nChinese Empire (Pl. III, fig. 2) as early as 150 B.C., and that the\r\n\"flying gallop,\" so to speak, \"flourished\" there for centuries, and\r\nwas transmitted by the Chinese artists to the Japanese, in whose\r\ndrawings it is frequent (Pl. III, fig. 3). It was at last finally\r\nbrought back to Europe, and to the extreme west of it, namely,\r\nEngland, by the importation in the eighteenth century into England of\r\nlarge numbers of Japanese works of art. It was a Japanese drawing (M.\r\nReinach infers) which suggested to Stubbs the upturned hinder hoofs\r\nand the detachment from the ground of \"the flying gallop\" which he\r\ngave in his portrait of \"Baronet,\" and so established that pose for a\r\ncentury in modern European art. This is a delightful tracing out of\r\nthe wanderings of an artistic \"convention,\" and the curious thing is\r\nthat its chief importance is not that it has to do with the movements\r\nof the horse, but that it tends (as do other discoveries) to establish\r\nthe gradual passage of pre-classical Mycenæan art across Central Asia\r\nto China and Japan by trade routes and human migrations which had no\r\ntouch with later Greece nor with Assyria nor India.\r\n\r\nHow did the Mycenæans come to invent, or at any rate adopt, the\r\nconvention of \"the flying gallop,\" seeing that it does not truly\r\nrepresent either the fact or the appearance of a galloping horse?\r\nThough 20,000 years ago the earliest of all known artists, the\r\nwonderful cave-men of the Reindeer period, drew bison, boars, and deer\r\nin rapid running movement with consummate skill, they were (be it said\r\nto their credit!) innocent of the conventional pose of the \"flying\r\ngallop.\" I base this statement on my own knowledge of their work. M.\r\nReinach thinks that the \"flying gallop\" was devised as an intentional\r\nexpression of energy in movement. I venture to hold the opinion that\r\nit was observed by the Mycenæans in the dog, in which Muybridge's\r\nphotographs (now before me) demonstrate that it occurs regularly as an\r\nattitude of that animal's quickest pace or gallop (see fig. 5, Pl.\r\nII). It is easy to see the \"flying gallop\" in the case of the dog,\r\nsince the dog does not travel so fast as the galloping horse, and can\r\nbe more readily brought under accurate vision on account of its\r\nsmaller size. The late Professor Marey (a great investigator of animal\r\nmovement) appears to have denied that the dog exhibits the full\r\nstretch of both limbs with the pads of the hind-feet upturned, and all\r\nthe feet free from the ground. He was mistaken, as Muybridge's\r\nphotograph giving side and back view of a galloping fox-terrier amply\r\ndemonstrates. It is quite in accordance with probability that the\r\nearly Mycenæan artists, having seen how the dog gallops, erroneously\r\nproceeded to put the galloping horse, and all other animals which\r\nthey wished \"to make gallop,\" into the same position.\r\n\r\nIt appears, then, that the poses used by artists at different times\r\nand in different parts of the world to represent the \"galloping\" of\r\nthe horse have no correspondence to any of the poses actually assumed\r\nby a galloping horse as now demonstrated by instantaneous photography.\r\nThe \"prancing\" attitude of the horses of the frieze of the Parthenon\r\nwas probably not intended to represent rapid movement at all. The\r\n\"stretched-leg\" pose and the \"flex-leg\" pose are, as a matter of fact,\r\nphases of \"the jump,\" and are definitely recorded in Muybridge's\r\ninstantaneous photographs of the jumping horse, but have no existence\r\nin \"galloping\" nor in any rapid running of the horse. They were\r\nprobably adopted by the artists of Egypt, Assyria, Greece, and their\r\nsuccessors in Europe as an expedient without conviction, to represent\r\nrapid movement, the true poses of which defied satisfactory\r\nreproduction. And it is also the fact that the \"flying gallop,\" which\r\nappeared in Mycenæan art thirty-seven centuries ago, and then\r\ntravelled by a \"Scythian\" route through Tartary to China, and came\r\nback to Europe at the end of the eighteenth century, is also--so far\r\nas it has any real representative in the action of the horse--only\r\napproached by a brief phase of the \"jump.\" The poses of the horse in\r\njumping are shown in the small figures taken from instantaneous\r\nphotographs and reproduced in Fig. 6 of Pl. III. The \"flying gallop\"\r\n(\"_ventre a terre_\"), with all four legs stretched, and the under\r\nsurface of the hind feet upturned, is really seen by us all every day\r\nin the dog, and is recorded in instantaneous photographs of that\r\nanimal going at full speed. In fact, the gallop of the dog (and of\r\nsome other small animals) is a series of jumps; the animal \"bounds\r\nalong.\" But this is a totally different thing from the gallop of the\r\nhorse. It is probable that the dog's gallop was transferred, so to\r\nspeak, to the horse by artists, and a certain justification for it was\r\nfound in one of the attitudes of a jumping horse, which, however,\r\nnever exhibits both the front and the hind legs simultaneously in so\r\ncompletely horizontal a position as they are made to take in the\r\nMycenæan gold-work and the modern \"racing plates.\"\r\n\r\nHow, then, we may now ask, ought an artist to represent a galloping\r\nhorse? Some critics say that he ought not to represent anything in\r\nsuch rapid action at all. But, putting that opinion aside, it is an\r\ninteresting question as to what a painter should depict on his canvas\r\nin order to convey to others who look at it the state of mind, of\r\nimpression, feeling, emotion, judgment, which a live, galloping horse\r\nproduces in him. The scientific draughtsman would, of course, present\r\nto us a series of drawings exactly like the instantaneous photographs,\r\nhis object being to show what \"is,\" and not what the artist aims at,\r\nnamely, what \"appears,\" \"seems,\" or (without pondering and analysis)\r\n\"is thought to be.\" The painter, in his quality of artist, would be\r\nwrong to select any one of the dozen or more poses of the galloping\r\nhorse published by Muybridge, each limited to the fortieth of a\r\nsecond, since no human eye can fix (as the photographic camera can)\r\nseparate pictures following one another at the rate of twenty a\r\nsecond, each enduring one fortieth of a second, and each separated by\r\nan interval of a fortieth of a second from the next. All the phases\r\nwhich occur in any one-tenth of a second (only two, or possibly three\r\nof the Muybridge series shown in Pl. I) are, as it were, fused in our\r\nvisual impression, because each picture lasts on the retina of the eye\r\nfor one-tenth of a second, or (to put it more accurately) because the\r\n\"impression\" or condition of the retina produced by each picture\r\npersists or endures for the tenth of a second.\r\n\r\nIt may, perhaps, be suggested (and, indeed, has been), that it is the\r\n\"blurred\" or \"fused\" picture produced by the successive poses of the\r\ngalloping horse's legs in one-tenth of a second that the painter ought\r\nto imitate on his canvas. In support of this notion we have the fact\r\nthat the rapidly running wheels of a coach or of a gun-carriage (as in\r\nthe pictures by Wouwerman) are represented by artists, not with the\r\ntwelve or fourteen spokes which we know to be there--and would be\r\nphotographed as separate things in an exposure of the fortieth of a\r\nsecond--but as a blurred haze of some fifty or more indistinct\r\n\"spokes.\" In this case it undoubtedly results that the observer of the\r\npicture is satisfied and receives the mental impression or illusion of\r\na rapid rotation of the wheel. I have tried the experiment with\r\ninstantaneous photographs of the galloping horse, and I get three\r\nresults: first, no combination of successive phases occupying\r\none-tenth of a second gives anything resembling the \"flying gallop\" of\r\nthe racing plates (the Mycenæan and Stubbsian pose), or any other\r\nconventional pose; second, no combination of successive instantaneous\r\nphotographs limited to ten second gives any pose which satisfies the\r\njudgment and suggests a movement like the gallop; third, the\r\ncombination which comes nearest to satisfying the judgment as being a\r\nnatural appearance, but does not quite succeed in doing so, is one\r\nformed by the fusion of figs. 2 and 3 of Pl. I. This gives all four\r\nlegs off the ground, drawn up or flexed beneath the horse's body, as\r\nin Morot's picture of the sabre-charge at Resonville.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that we have to take into consideration two other factors\r\nin the process, which we call \"seeing,\" besides the duration of the\r\nretinal impression or excitation. These are, first, attention, and\r\nsecond, judgment. We are apt to think that \"seeing\" is a simple,\r\nstraightforward sort of thing, whereas it is really a strangely\r\ncomplex and delusive process. \"I did not see it, therefore it was not\r\nthere,\" or \"You must have seen it; it was right in front of you,\" are\r\ncommon assertions, and the belief that such assertions are justified\r\nleads to miscarriage of justice in courts of law. Yet everyone knows\r\nthat he may stare out of the window of a railway carriage and have a\r\nlong panorama pass before his eyes, or may walk along a crowded street\r\nand look his acquaintances in the face, and in neither case will he\r\nhave \"seen\" or recognized anything, or be able to give an account of\r\nthe scene that was pictured on the back of his eye. Attention, the\r\ndirection of the mind to the sensation, is necessary; and it appears\r\nthat it is very difficult (to some more than to others) to hold the\r\nattention alert, and to give it to the _unexpected_. In fact, to a\r\nvery large extent we can only \"see\" (using the word to signify the\r\nultimate mental condition) that which we are prepared to see or that\r\nwhich we expect to see. In the absence of such expectation, a very\r\nstrongly illuminated or well-marked, outstanding object is far more\r\nreadily \"seen\" than less marked objects. Accordingly, the outstretched\r\nlegs of the galloping horse, now in front and now behind, are \"seen,\"\r\nwhilst the rest of the phases are not observed. Moreover, it is a fact\r\nthat the swinging pendulum of a clock is \"seen\" at the extreme\r\nposition of the swing on each side, and not in the intermediate space.\r\nThis is because the image is formed very quickly, twice in the space\r\nwhere the bob of the pendulum is coming to the limit of its swing and\r\nis again returning on its course. For the same reason, the\r\noutstretched legs of the horse going up to their limit and at once\r\nreturning give in very quick succession, near their extreme limit, an\r\nascending and a descending phase which are not strictly but sensibly\r\nalike, and so doubly impress the retina, and obtain for the legs\r\n\"attention\" when in that extreme position. The choice of the attitude\r\ndepicted by Morot is explained by the fact that, as is shown by its\r\npersistence through two successive pictures (figs. 2 and 3 of Pl. I),\r\nthis pose must produce a more continuous impression on the retina than\r\nany other of the attitudes shown, since none of them endure through\r\ntwo successive pictures.\r\n\r\nThe mental process of attention results in a certain duration or\r\nmemory of the mental condition which is a distinct thing from the\r\nprimary retinal impression, and leads to the ignoring or mental\r\nobliteration of an instantaneous interval separating two phases of the\r\nposition of moving legs which have strongly \"arrested the attention.\"\r\nHence, it seems that the most forward pose of the galloping horse's\r\nfront legs and the most backward pose of its hind legs--though far\r\nfrom simultaneous, even in the slow changing retinal impressions--may\r\nbe mentally combined by \"the arrest of attention,\" and that the artist\r\nreally ought to present his picture of the galloping horse with those\r\ntwo poses combined (although as a matter of scientific truth they do\r\nnot occur simultaneously) in order that he may produce by his painted\r\npiece of canvas, as nearly as he can, the mental result which we call\r\n\"seeing\" a horse gallop. This combination of the front half of one\r\nfigure with the hinder half of another so as to give in each case the\r\nextreme phase of extension of the legs I have made in Pl. I, fig. 12.\r\n\r\nBut there is, further, in all \"seeing\" before even a mental result of\r\n_attention_ to the retinal picture is, as it were, \"passed,\" admitted\r\nand registered as \"a thing seen,\" the further operation of rapid\r\ncriticism or _judgment_, brief though it be. We are always\r\nunconsciously forming lightning-like judgments by the use of our eyes,\r\nrejecting the improbable, and (as we consider) preposterous, and\r\naccepting and therefore \"seeing\" what our judgment approves even when\r\nit is not there! We accept as \"a thing seen\" a wheel buzzing round\r\nwith something like fifty spokes--but we cannot accept a horse with\r\neight or sixteen legs! The four-leggedness of a horse is too dominant\r\na prejudice for us to accept a horse with several indistinct blurred\r\nlegs as representing what we see when the horse gallops. The mind\r\nrevolts at such a presentation, though it is true, and the whole\r\nscheme and composition of the artist is perverted or fails to gain\r\nattention and to exercise its charm--by the unwelcome presence in his\r\npicture of the revolting truth. It is the consideration of facts of\r\nthis kind which enables us to understand the origin and importance of\r\nwhat are called \"conventions\" in pictorial or glyptic art. The artist\r\nis, in fact, operating by means of his painted canvas or moulded clay\r\nupon a queer, prejudiced, ill-seeing, dull, living creature--his\r\nbrother-man. In order to give if possible to that brother, by means of\r\na painted sheet, some or all of the delights, emotions, suggestions,\r\nperceptions of beauty, and so on, which he himself has experienced in\r\ncontemplating a real scene, the artist has to present that scene, not\r\nas it really is, nor even as he thinks it really is, but in such a way\r\nthat his canvas shall appeal to his brother's attention and judgment\r\nwith the same emotional and intellectual result as the scene itself\r\nproduced in him. Therefore he must not aim at accuracy of reproduction\r\nof natural fact nor even of visual fact, but at the transference to\r\nanother mind of his own mental condition--his inner judgment as to\r\n\"things seen\"--by means of necessarily imperfect pictorial mimicry. He\r\nmust therefore avoid startling or abnormal truthfulness of observation\r\nof the unessential and even more strictly must he refuse to make his\r\npicture a scientific diagram demonstrating what \"is\" rather than what\r\nis \"seen\" or is \"thought to have been seen.\"\r\n\r\nOn these grounds I find that the most satisfactory pictures of the\r\ngalloping horse are those which combine a phase of the movement of the\r\nfront legs with a phase of the movement of the hind legs, not\r\nsimultaneous in actual occurrence, but following one another. It is\r\nfor the artist to select the combination best suited to producing the\r\nmental result aimed at. Some of the Chinese and Japanese\r\nrepresentations of the galloping horse and some of their European\r\nimitations (but not all--certainly not that of Stubbs, of the Epsom\r\nDerby of Géricault, and the racing plates) seem to me to be eminently\r\nsatisfactory and successful in this respect. In the pictures to which\r\nI allude (Pl. III, figs. 3 and 5) all the legs are off the ground; the\r\nfront legs are advanced, but one or both may be more or less flexed,\r\nwhilst the hind legs, though directed backwards with upturned hoofs,\r\nare not nearly horizontal (as they actually are in the galloping dog),\r\nbut show the moderate extension which really occurs in the horse, and\r\nis recorded by instantaneous photography. This pose, favoured by many\r\nEuropean and Japanese artists, can be obtained by uniting the\r\noutstretched hind legs of fig. 9 of the Muybridge series (Pl. I), with\r\nthe outstretched forelegs of fig. 6, as shown in Pl. I, fig. 12, or by\r\nuniting the hind legs of fig. 10 with the forelegs of fig. 4 as shown\r\nin Pl. III, fig. 1.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the representation of other \"gaits\" of the horse than\r\nthat of the rapid gallop--such as canter, trot, amble, rack, and\r\nwalk--I have no doubt that instantaneous photography can (and in\r\npractice does) furnish the painter with perfectly correct and at the\r\nsame time useful and satisfactory poses of the horse's limbs. These,\r\nthough of longer duration than the poses of the gallop, can only be\r\ncorrectly estimated by the eye with great difficulty, and only\r\nsketched by artists of exceptional skill and patience. The movement of\r\nthe wings of birds in flight has been very successfully analysed by\r\ninstantaneous photography. Some of the poses revealed must familiarise\r\nthe public with what can be, and, in fact, has been, observed in the\r\ncase of large sea-birds, by the unassisted eye, and has been\r\nrepresented in pictures by the more careful observers of nature among\r\nmodern painters. A large sea-bird sailing along with apparently\r\nmotionless wings has been photographed in the act of giving a single\r\nstroke so rapid as to escape observation by the eye.\r\n\r\nAn interesting question in regard to the movements of the horse is\r\nthat as to how far any known \"pace\" is natural to that animal, and how\r\nfar it has been acquired by training and is, in a sense, artificial.\r\nWe know so little of the wild horse, and of the more abundant wild\r\nasses and zebras, that it is difficult to say anything precise on this\r\nquestion. There is only one region in which the true original wild\r\nhorse of the northern part of Asia and Europe still exists. That is\r\nthe Gobi Desert, in Central Asia. This horse is known as Prevalsky's\r\nwild horse, in honour of the Russian traveller who discovered it. Live\r\nspecimens are now to be seen in the Zoological Gardens and elsewhere.\r\nIt closely resembles the drawings of horses made by the palæolithic\r\nCromagnard cave-men. A century ago a wild horse, probably of the same\r\nrace as this, inhabited the Kirghiz Steppes, and was known as the\r\nTarpan: it is now extinct. The more southern Arabian horse is not\r\nknown in the wild state, whilst the wild horses of America are\r\ndescendants of domesticated European horses which have \"run wild.\" I\r\ndo not know of any studies of the movements of the true wild horse,\r\nnor of those of wild asses and zebras, carried out by the aid of\r\ninstantaneous photography. It would be interesting to know whether\r\nuntaught wild \"equines\" would fall naturally into the gaits known as\r\n\"the amble\" and \"the rack,\" or whether the walk, the trot, and the\r\ngallop are their only natural gaits.\r\n\r\nThe amble, in which the fore and hind leg on the same side are\r\nadvanced simultaneously, is a natural gait of the elephant, the\r\nfastest Muybridge could get from that great beast. He made a menagerie\r\nelephant amble at the rate of a mile in seven minutes. The only other\r\nanimal known to habitually exhibit \"the amble\" is the giraffe. It is\r\noften exhibited by the giraffes in the Zoological Gardens in London,\r\nbut has not, I believe, been recorded by a series of instantaneous\r\nphotographs. When going at full speed over the grass wilds of Central\r\nAfrica the giraffe exhibits a gait more like the galloping of deer and\r\nantelopes, and carries the long neck horizontally. No complete study\r\nof the \"gaits\" of large animals other than the horse has been made,\r\nsince menagerie specimens and menagerie conditions are not\r\nsatisfactory for the purpose, and, unfortunately, it has not been\r\npossible as yet to take series of photographs of them in their wild\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nThe electric spark furnishes a most important means of taking\r\ninstantaneous photographs, but the operator must perform in the dark.\r\nAn electric spark can be obtained which lasts only the one\r\ntwo-thousandth of a second, and by its use as the sole illuminating\r\nagent we can get a photograph of a phase of movement lasting only that\r\nexcessively short space of time, or, if we please, a succession of\r\nsuch phases by using a succession of sparks. Thus, a rifle bullet is\r\nreadily photographed while in flight with scarcely perceptible\r\ndistortion. A wheel revolving many hundred times a second can thus be\r\nphotographed, and appears to be stationary. Dr. Schillings has applied\r\nthis method to the photography of wild animals by night in the forests\r\nof tropical Africa, and has published an interesting book giving his\r\nphotographic results. In order to take these pictures the track\r\nfollowed by certain animals has to be detected, and then a thread is\r\nstretched \"breast-high\" across the track, so that the animal coming\r\nalong it by night shall pull the thread. Immediately the thread is\r\npulled it sets an electric contact in action. There is a brief flash\r\nof one two-thousandth of a second, and a picture is taken by a camera\r\npreviously fixed, out of harm's way, so as to focus the area where the\r\nthread was stretched.\r\n\r\nDr. Schillings obtained some very remarkable photographs of \"the night\r\nlife of the forest\" in this way--lions and leopards advancing on their\r\nprey were suddenly revealed, and the helpless antelope or other victim\r\nwas shown crouching in the dark, or making a desperate effort to\r\nescape.\r\n\r\nThe electric-spark method was applied by a friend of mine to\r\ndemonstrate the movements by which a kitten falling backwards from a\r\ntable succeeds in turning itself so as to alight on its feet. During a\r\nfall of less than 3 feet he obtained five successive spark-pictures of\r\nthe kitten, which, I beg it may be clearly understood, was a pet\r\nkitten, and was neither frightened nor hurt by the proceedings.\r\n\r\nInstantaneous photographs, whether obtained by the use of an electric\r\nspark as a means of illumination, or by the less rapid method of a\r\nspring shutter working in combination with a sensitive film, which is\r\njerked along so as to be exposed when the shutter is open and travel\r\nwhen it is shut, has been applied to the analysis of other movements\r\nthan those I have mentioned, and has yet to be applied to many more,\r\nsuch as the crawling of insects and millipedes, and the beautiful\r\nrippling movement of the legs and body by which many marine worms\r\nswim. It has been extensively used in the study of human locomotion,\r\nand of the successive poses of the arms and legs in various athletic\r\nexercises, and in such games as baseball and golf.\r\n\r\nA first-rate fencer of my acquaintance had a five-minutes' film of\r\nhimself taken when fencing, giving 10,000 consecutive poses. He wished\r\nto see exactly what movements he made, and to ascertain by this minute\r\nexamination any error or want of grace in his action, in order to\r\navoid it. An unexpected picture is obtained when a man or woman is\r\nthus \"biographed\" whilst walking rapidly, and suddenly turns to the\r\nright or left. A fraction of a second occurs when the toes of the two\r\nfeet are directed towards one another (that is to say, are \"turned\r\nin\"), as one of the legs swings round in the break-off to right or\r\nleft. This instantaneous phase is very awkward and ugly in appearance.\r\nIt is never pictured by artists, although regularly occurring, and\r\nseems to have been as little known before instantaneous photography\r\nwas introduced as were most of the phases of the horse's gallop. The\r\npositions assumed when in the air by a high-jump athlete are almost\r\nincredible as revealed by the camera. He appears to be sitting in a\r\nmost uncomfortable way on the rope over which he is projecting\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nA very fine attitude is fixed for the artist in one of Muybridge's\r\ninstantaneous series of the \"bowler\"--the cricket \"bowler.\" The\r\nup-lifted right arm, the curve outwards of the whole figure on the\r\nright side, and the free hang of the right leg make a most effective\r\npose for a sculptor to reproduce. Among the most remarkable results\r\nobtained in Muybridge's series are the stages of the growth or\r\ndevelopment of strong \"expression\" in the face. The anxiety in the\r\nface of the baseball batsman as he awaits the ball is painful; as he\r\nhits at the ball his expression is one of savage ferocity, and in a\r\nfraction of a second this gives place to a dawning smile, which as we\r\npass along two or three later \"_instantanèes_\" develops into a broad\r\ngrin of satisfaction. Another genuine study of expression both of face\r\nand gesture and movement is given in the series where a pailful of\r\ncold water is unexpectedly poured over the back of a bather seated in\r\na sitz bath--astonishment, dismay, anger, eagerness to escape, and the\r\nreaction to shock are all clearly shown. Darwin's studies on \"the\r\nexpression of the emotions\" would have been greatly assisted by such\r\nanalysis, and the subject might even now be developed by the use of\r\nserial instantaneous records obtained by photography. It may be useful\r\nto those interested in this subject to know that copies of\r\nMuybridge's large series of instantaneous photographs[3] of animal and\r\nhuman subjects in movement are preserved both in the library of the\r\nRoyal Academy of Arts in London and in the Radcliffe Library at\r\nOxford. I may also mention the extremely valuable series of\r\ninstantaneous photographs of living bacteria, blood-parasites and\r\ninfusoria produced by MM. Pathé, and the series of fishes and various\r\ninvertebrates (including the curious caterpillar-like Peripatus) taken\r\nby Mr. Martin Duncan.\r\n\r\nThe representation of the moon in pictures of the ordinary size (some\r\nthree feet long by two in height) is a case in which the artist\r\nhabitually--one may almost say invariably--departs greatly from\r\nscientific truth, and it is a question as to whether he is justified\r\nin what he does. Take first the case of the low-lying moon near the\r\nhorizon as contrasted with the high moon. Everyone knows that the moon\r\n(and the sun[4] also) appears to be much bigger when it is low than\r\nwhen it is high. Everyone who has not looked into the matter closely\r\nis prepared to maintain that the luminous disc in the sky--whether of\r\nmoon or of sun--not merely seems to, but actually does, occupy a\r\nbigger space when it is low down near the horizon than when it is high\r\nup, more nearly overhead. Of course, no one nowadays imagines that the\r\nmoon or the sun swells as it sinks or diminishes in volume as it\r\nrises. Those who think about it at all, say that the greater length of\r\natmosphere through which one sees the low sun or moon, as compared\r\nwith the high, magnifies the disc as a lens might do. This, however,\r\nis not the case. If we take a photograph of the moon when low and\r\nanother with the same instrument and the same focus when it is high,\r\nwe find that the celestial disc produces on the plate (as it does on\r\nour eyes) a picture-disc of practically the same size in both\r\npositions. In fact, the high moon or sun produces a picture-disc of a\r\nlittle larger size than the low moon or sun. I have here reproduced\r\n(Pl. IV) a photograph, published by M. Flammarion, in which the moon\r\nhas been allowed to print itself on a photographic plate exposed\r\nduring the time the moon was rising, and it is seen that the track of\r\nthe moon has not diminished in width as it rose higher and higher. No\r\none will readily believe this, yet it is a demonstrable fact.\r\nAstronomers have made accurate measurements which show that there is\r\nno diminution of the disc under these circumstances, but a slight\r\nincrease--since the moon is a very little nearer to us when overhead\r\nthan when we see it across the horizon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate IV.--The track of the rising moon registered by\r\ncontinuous exposure of a photographic plate. It is given here in order\r\nto show that the diameter of the visible disc of the moon does not\r\ndiminish as it rises. The slight increase in the breadth of the track\r\nregistered by the moon's disc is probably due to a little distortion\r\ncaused by the side portion of the lens. After M. Flammarion. The\r\nactual width of the moon's disc as printed here is a little over one\r\neighth of an inch, which, if we regard it as \"a picture\" and not\r\nmerely as a mechanical record, implies that the observer's eye is only\r\nabout 14-1/2 inches distant from the picture plane instead of the more\r\nusual 18 inches, which corresponds to a diameter of the pictured\r\nmoon's disc of between 1/6th and 1/7th of an inch (.156 inch).]\r\n\r\nIf we put a piece of glass coated with a thin layer of water-colour\r\npaint into a frame, and then make a peep-hole in a board which we fix\r\nupright between us and the upright piece of framed glass, we can keep\r\nthe framed glass steady (let us suppose it to be part of the window of\r\na room), and then we can move the peep-hole board back from it into\r\nthe room to measured distances. At a distance of one and a half feet\r\nfrom the framed glass, which is that at which an artist usually has\r\nhis eye from his canvas or paper, we can trace on the smeared or\r\ntinted piece of glass the outlines of things seen through it exactly\r\nas they fill up the area of the glass--men, houses, trees, the moon.\r\nThe moon's disc (and the same is true of the sun) is found always to\r\noccupy a space on the glass which is 1/115th of the distance of the\r\neye from the framed glass plate. When the eye-to-frame distance is\r\neighteen inches, the diameter of the disc of the moon on the smeared\r\nglass will occupy exactly 1/115th of eighteen inches, which is between\r\none-sixth and one-seventh of an inch. Similarly if the peep-hole is at\r\nnine and a half feet or 114 inches from the framed glass (which stands\r\nfor us as the equivalent of an artist's picture) the moon will occupy\r\nalmost exactly one inch in diameter--the size of a halfpenny. With\r\nsuch a simple apparatus of peep-hole and smeared glass in an upright\r\nframe, it is easy to mark off the size covered by the moon (or sun),\r\nwhether low or high, on the smeared glass, and it is found never to\r\nvary whether high or low--so long as the same \"eye-to-frame\" or\r\n\"peep-hole\" distance is preserved. That seems to be an important fact\r\nfor painters of sun-sets and moon-rises. But what do they do? They\r\nnever give the right size (namely one-sixth of an inch) which\r\ncorresponds to an eye-to-frame distance of eighteen inches. They give\r\nto a high moon, if they are very careful, a quarter of an inch for\r\ndiameter. This means that the observer is about two and a half feet,\r\nor thirty inches from the picture--nearly twice what the artist's eye\r\nreally is as he paints. And then--if painting a moon-rise or\r\nsunset--they suddenly pretend to go to a distance of nine and a half\r\nfeet from the picture and make the moon an inch across because it is\r\nlow down, or even give the moon two inches in diameter, which would\r\nmean that they (and those who look at the picture when hung up for\r\nview) are observing at nineteen feet distance from the front plane or\r\nframe of the picture. They do not alter the other features in the\r\npicture to suit this change of distance of the eye from the frame and\r\nthere is no warning given. Certainly there is no obvious and necessary\r\nreason for treating a picture containing a high moon as though you\r\nwere three feet from the front plane of the scene presented, and a low\r\nmoon as though you were twenty feet from that plane! The confusion\r\nwhich may result in the representation of other objects when these\r\nchanges of eye-to-frame distance are made is shown by the following\r\nsimple facts. According to the simple laws of perspective, if the eye\r\nis at thirty inches from the picture-plane or frame (as declared by a\r\nmoon drawn of a little more than a quarter of an inch broad), a post\r\nor a man six feet high drawn on the canvas as three inches high\r\nabsolutely and definitely means that that man or post is sixty feet\r\naway from the observer inside the picture. The height of the\r\nrepresented object is the same fraction of the real object as the\r\neye-to-frame distance is of the distance of the observer to the real\r\nobject. If by a two-inch moon the artist has thrown you back from the\r\nfront plane of the scene to a distance of nineteen feet, then the\r\nsix-foot post or man drawn as three inches high definitely asserts\r\nthat it or he is 456 feet distant within the picture. So, too, if the\r\nchurch tower which cuts the moon is really sixty feet high and is\r\ndrawn of two inches vertical measure in the picture, it is an\r\nassertion--when the moon is represented one quarter of an inch\r\nbroad--that the church tower is 290 yards, or a sixth of a mile\r\ndistant. If, on the other hand, other things remaining the same, the\r\nmoon is drawn two inches in diameter, the church tower is now asserted\r\nto be eight times as far off, or about a mile and a third. Very\r\ngenerally these facts are not considered by painters. They represent\r\nthe low moon (or sun) big because the erroneous mental impression is\r\ncommon to all of us that it _is_ big--that is, bigger, much bigger,\r\nthan the high moon or sun, and they do not follow out the consequences\r\nin perspective of the pictorial increase of the moon's apparent\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\nIf we could ascertain why it is that the low moon produces a false\r\nimpression of being bigger--as a mere disc in the scene--than does the\r\nhigh moon, we might be able to discover how an artist could produce,\r\nas Nature does, an impression or belief in its greater size whilst\r\nkeeping it all the time to its proper size. The explanation of the\r\nillusion as to the increased size of the sun's or moon's disc when\r\nlow, given by M. Flammarion and other astronomers, is that the low sun\r\nor moon is unconsciously judged by us as an object at a greater\r\ndistance than the high moon or sun. This is due to the long vista of\r\narching clouds above and of stretching landscape or sea below when the\r\nsun or moon is looked at as it appears on or near the horizon. The\r\nillusion is aided by the dulness of the low moon and the brightness\r\n(supposed nearness) of the high moon. Being judged of (unconsciously)\r\nas further off than the high moon, the low moon is estimated as of\r\nlarger size although of the same size. This is, I believe, the correct\r\nexplanation of the illusion. When one gazes upwards to the sky, a\r\nsmall insect slowly flying across the line of sight sometimes is\r\n\"judged of\" as a huge bird--an eagle or a vulture--since we refer it\r\nto a distance at which birds fly and not to the shorter distance to\r\nwhich insects approach us. It seems that it would be possible for the\r\npainter, by carefully studying actual natural facts and introducing\r\ntheir presentation into his picture, to produce the impression of\r\ngreater distance, and therefore of size, into a quarter-inch moon\r\nplaced near the horizon. He is not compelled for want of other means\r\nto \"cut the difficulty\" and paint a falsely inflated moon which shall\r\nbrutally and by measurement call up the illusion of increased size. I\r\nreproduce here (Pl. V) an interesting drawing which shows how such\r\nillusions of size _can_ be produced. It is none the worse for my\r\npurpose because it is an advertisement by the well-known firm who\r\nhave kindly lent it to me. The three figures represented in black\r\nare all of the same height, yet the furthest one appears to be much\r\ntaller and bigger altogether than the middle one, and the middle one\r\nthan the nearest. This result is obtained by suggesting distance as\r\nseparating the right-hand figure from us, whilst giving it exactly the\r\nsame height as the others. This seems to me to be a simple case of an\r\nillusion of increased size produced by a suggestion of increased\r\ndistance when all the time there is equality in size--as in the case\r\nof the moon on the horizon compared with the moon overhead. It would\r\nbe interesting to see an attempt on the part of a competent painter to\r\nproduce in this way (which is, I believe, Nature's way) the illusion\r\nof increased size in a low-lying moon without really increasing the\r\nvisual size of his painted moon as compared with one in another\r\npicture (to be painted by him) representing the moon bright, clear and\r\nsmall, overhead.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate V.--Drawing of three figures--Lord Lansdowne, Mr.\r\nLloyd George, and Mr. Asquith--showing how an illusion of size may be\r\nproduced in a picture. The figure of Mr. Asquith is of the same actual\r\nvertical measurement as that of Lord Lansdowne, viz. two inches and\r\none eighth. Yet owing to the position in which the three figures are\r\nplaced and the converging lines--suggesting perspective--the drawing\r\nof Mr. Asquith does not merely represent a much taller man than does\r\nthat of Lord Lansdowne, but actually gives the impression, at first\r\nsight, that the little black figure representing Mr. Asquith is longer\r\nand bigger altogether than that representing Lord Lansdowne. Yet the\r\nfigures are of the same dimensions. It is owing to illusion of the\r\nsame nature that the disc of the low moon appears larger than that of\r\nthe high moon.]\r\n\r\nThe theatrical scene-painter has another kind of difficulty with the\r\nlow moon and the setting sun. He can never be right for more than one\r\nrow of seats--one distance--in the theatre. Here there is no\r\npeep-hole, no frame or picture-plane. The observer is _in_ the\r\npicture. If the moon is represented by an illuminated disc of one foot\r\nin diameter, it will, when looked at at a distance of 115 feet, have\r\nthe same visual size as the moon itself, but if your seat is nearer\r\nthe scene it will look too large, if further off it will look too\r\nsmall. There is no getting over this difficulty, as the standard of\r\nactual Nature is set up on the stage by the men and women appearing on\r\nit at a known distance. It used to be asked in classical times by\r\ningenious puzzle-makers--\"What is the size of the moon?\" A true answer\r\nto that question would be \"that of a plate a foot in diameter seen at\r\na distance of a hundred and fifteen feet.\"\r\n\r\nTo a large extent the painter, like other artists, has to produce\r\nthings which do not shock common opinion and experience, and must even\r\nconsciously concede to that necessity, and make the sacrifice of\r\nobjective truth, in order to secure attention for his higher appeal to\r\nthe sense of beauty, to emotion, and sentiment. Approved departures by\r\nthe artist from scientific truth are those which are deliberately made\r\nin order to give emphasis--as, for instance, in the huge, but tender\r\nhand of the man in the emotional masterpiece, \"Le Baiser,\" by the\r\ngreat sculptor Rodin. Another departure from objective truth which is\r\njustified, is seen in Troyon's picture in the Louvre, where the false\r\ndrawing and exaggerated size of the leg of a calf advancing towards\r\nthe observer suggest, and almost give the illusion of, movement.\r\n\r\nBut it can hardly be maintained that any and all the liberties which a\r\npainter or a whole school of painters choose to take with fact in\r\ntheir presentation of Nature--are beyond criticism. It is possible for\r\na landscape painter to improve in his treatment of the moon by better\r\nobservation and increased knowledge--just as other painters have\r\nlearnt not to introduce into their pictures the sort of wooden\r\nrocking-horse to stand for a beautiful living animal, which satisfied\r\nVelasquez, Carl Vernet and the ancient Egyptians.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See note on page 46.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: \"La Representation du Galop dans l'art ancien et\r\nmoderne,\" 'Revue Archeologique,' vol. XXXVI _et seq._, 1900.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: A word is needed in amplification of what was said on p.\r\n26 as to the blending of successive images produced on the retina of\r\nthe eye by the bioscope or cinematograph or by the old \"wheel of\r\nlife.\" The point which is of importance is not the length of time\r\nduring which the stimulation of the retina caused by an image\r\n_endures_--becoming weaker and weaker as fractions of a second\r\npass--but it is this: How long will a stimulus last in _undiminished\r\nbrightness_? How soon must it be followed by another stimulus (another\r\nimage) so that there may be fusion or continuity, the one succeeding\r\nthe other before the earlier has had time, not to disappear, but to\r\ndecline. If it has had time to decline in intensity, the appearance of\r\nflickering results. That is what the cinematographer has to avoid. It\r\nis found that a quicker succession--a shorter interval--is necessary\r\nwith strong light than with weaker light in order to produce\r\ncontinuity. With a faint light the interval may be as great as\r\none-tenth of a second; with a strong light it must not exceed\r\none-thirtieth (or with still stronger light, one-sixtieth) of a\r\nsecond. With the stronger light there is a more rapid and a greater\r\nloss of the initial intensity of the impression or effect of stimulus,\r\nand though each successive effect remains as long, or longer, in\r\ndwindling intensity, you get want of continuity, or \"flicker.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: What we may call the \"visual size\" of the sun happens to\r\nbe owing to its far greater size and its far greater distance from\r\nus--very nearly the same as that of the moon--and is subject to the\r\nsame numerical law of apparent diameter, viz. a disc of any given\r\nmeasurement in diameter will cover it exactly when held at a distance\r\nfrom the eye which is 115 times that measurement.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE JEWEL IN THE TOAD'S HEAD\r\n\r\n\r\nTo what jewel or precious stone was Shakespeare alluding when he makes\r\nthe exiled Duke in \"As You Like It\" (after praising his rough life in\r\nthe forest of Arden, and declaring that adversity has its\r\ncompensations), exclaim:\r\n\r\n    \"The toad, ugly and venomous,\r\n    Wears yet a precious jewel in his head\"?\r\n\r\nNo doubt the unprejudiced reader supposes when he reads this passage\r\nthat there is some stone or stone-like body in the head of the toad\r\nwhich has a special beauty, or else was believed to possess magical or\r\nmedicinal properties. And it is probable that Shakespeare himself did\r\nsuppose that such a stone existed. As a matter of fact there is no\r\nstone or \"jewel\" of any kind in the head of the common toad nor of any\r\nspecies of toad--common or rare. This is a simple and certain result\r\nof the careful examination of the heads of innumerable toads, and is\r\nnot merely \"common knowledge,\" but actually the last word of the\r\nscientific expert. In these days of \"nature study\" writers familiar\r\nwith toads and frogs and kindred beasts have puzzled over\r\nShakespeare's words, and suggested that he was really referring to the\r\nbeautiful eyes of the toad, which are like gems in colour and\r\nbrilliance.\r\n\r\nThis, however, is not the case. Shakespeare himself was simply making\r\nuse of what was considered to be \"common knowledge\" in his day when he\r\nmade the Duke compare adversity to the toad with a magic jewel in its\r\nhead commonly known as \"a toad-stone,\" although that \"common\r\nknowledge\" was really not knowledge at all, but--like an enormous mass\r\nof the accepted current statements in those times, about animals,\r\nplants and stones--was an absolutely baseless invention. Such baseless\r\nbeliefs were due to the perfectly innocent but reckless habit of\r\nmankind, throughout long ages, of exaggerating and building up\r\nmarvellous narrations on the one hand, and on the other hand of\r\nbelieving without any sufficient inquiry, and with delight and\r\nenthusiasm, such marvellous narrations set down by others. Each writer\r\nor \"gossip\" concerning the wonders of unexplored nature, consciously\r\nor unconsciously, added a little to the story as received by him, and\r\nso the authoritative statements as to marvels grew more and more\r\nastonishing and interesting.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the time of Shakespeare himself that another spirit\r\nbegan to assert itself--namely, that of asking whether a prevalent\r\nbelief or tradition is actually a true statement of fact. Men\r\nproceeded to test the belief by an examination of the thing in\r\nquestion, and not by merely adducing the assertions of \"the learned\r\nso-and-so,\" or of \"the ingenious Mr. Dash.\" This spirit of inquiry\r\nactually existed in a fairly active state among the more cultivated of\r\nthe ancient Greeks. Aristotle (who flourished about 350 B.C.), though\r\nhe could not free himself altogether from the primitive tendency to\r\naccept the marvellous as true because it is marvellous and without\r\nregard to its probability--in fact because of its improbability--yet\r\non the whole showed a determination to investigate, and to see things\r\nfor himself, and left in his writings an immense series of first-rate\r\noriginal observations. He had far more of the modern scientific spirit\r\nthan had the innumerable credulous writers of Western Europe who lived\r\nfifteen hundred to two thousand years after him. Even that delightful\r\nperson Herodotus, who preceded Aristotle by a hundred years,\r\noccasionally took the trouble to inquire into some of the wonders he\r\nheard of on his travels, and is careful to say now and then that he\r\ndoes not believe what he heard. But the mediæval-makers of\r\n\"bestiaries,\" herbals, and treatises on stones, which were collections\r\nof every possible fancy and \"old-wife's tale,\" about animals, plants,\r\nand minerals, mixed up with Greek and Arabic legends and the\r\nmystical, medical lore of the \"Physiologus\"--that Byzantine cyclopædia\r\nof \"wisdom while you wait\"--deliberately discarded all attempt to set\r\ndown the truth; they simply gave that up as a bad job, and recorded\r\nevery strange story, property and \"application\" (as they termed it) of\r\nnatural objects with solemn assurance, adding a bit of their own\r\ninvention to the gathered and growing mass of preposterous\r\nmisunderstanding and superstition.\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth century the opposition to this method of omnivorous\r\ncredulity (which even to-day, in spite of all our \"progress,\"\r\nflourishes among both the rich and the poor) crystallised in the\r\npurpose of the Royal Society of London for the Improvement of Natural\r\nKnowledge--whose motto was, and is \"_Nullius in verba_\" (that is, \"We\r\nswear by no man's words\"), and whose original first rule, to be\r\nobserved at its meetings, was that no one should discourse of his\r\nopinions or narrate a marvel, but that any member who wished to\r\naddress the society should \"bring in,\" that is to say, \"exhibit\" an\r\nexperiment or an actual specimen. A new spirit, the \"scientific\"\r\nspirit, gave rise to and was nourished by this and similar societies\r\nof learned men. As a consequence the absurdities and the cruel and\r\ninjurious beliefs in witchcraft, astrology, and baseless legend,\r\nmelted away like clouds before the rising sun. In the place of the mad\r\nnightmare of fantastic ignorance, there grew up the solid body of\r\nunassailable knowledge of Nature and of man which we call \"science\"--a\r\ngrowth which made such prodigious strides in the last century that we\r\nnow may truly be said to live in the presence of a new heaven and a\r\nnew earth!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.--Representation of a man extracting the jewel\r\nfrom a toad's head; two \"jewels\", already extracted are seen dropping\r\nto the ground. From the \"Hortus Sanitatis,\" published in 1490.]\r\n\r\nIt was, then, a real \"stone,\" called the toad-stone, to which\r\nShakespeare alluded. It is mentioned in various old treatises\r\nconcerning the magical and medicinal properties of gems and stones\r\nunder its Latin name, \"_Bufonius lapis_,\" and was also called Borax,\r\nNosa, Crapondinus, Crapaudina, Chelonitis, and Batrachites. It was\r\nalso called Grateriano and Garatronius, after a gentleman named\r\nGratterus, who in 1473 found a very large one, reputed to have\r\nmarvellous power. In 1657, in the \"translation by a person of\r\nquality\" of the \"Thaumatographia\" of a Polish physician named\r\nJonstonus, we find written of it: \"Toads produce a stone, with their\r\nown image sometimes. It hath very great force against malignant\r\ntumours that are venomous. They are used to heat it in a bag, and to\r\nlay it hot, without anything between, to the naked body, and to rub\r\nthe affected place with it. They say it prevails against inchantments\r\nof witches, especially for women and children bewitched. So soon as\r\nyou apply it to one bewitched it sweats many drops. In the plague it\r\nis laid to the heart to strengthen it.\" Another physician of the same\r\nperiod (see \"Notes and Queries,\" fourth series, vol. vii, 1871, p.\r\n540) appears to be affected by the new spirit of inquiry, for he\r\nrelates the old traditions about the stone and how he tested them. He\r\nsays it was reported that the stone could be cut out of the toad's\r\nhead. (In the book called \"Hortus Sanitatis,\" dated 1490, there is a\r\npicture, here reproduced [Fig. 4], of a gentleman performing this\r\noperation successfully on a gigantic toad.) Our sceptical physician,\r\nhowever, goes on to say that it was commonly believed that these\r\nstones are thrown out of the mouth by old toads (probably the tongue\r\nwas mistaken for the stone), and that if toads are placed on a piece\r\nof red cloth they will eject their \"toad-stones,\" but rapidly swallow\r\nthem again before one can seize the precious gem! He says that when he\r\nwas a boy he procured an aged toad and placed it on a red cloth in\r\norder to obtain possession of \"the stone.\" He sat watching the toad\r\nall night, but the toad did not eject anything. \"Since that time,\" he\r\nsays, \"I have always regarded as humbug ('badineries') all that they\r\nrelate of the toad-stone and of its origin.\" He then describes the\r\nactual stone which passes as the toad-stone, or \"_Bufonius lapis_,\"\r\nand says that it is also called batrachite, or brontia, or ombria. His\r\ndescription exactly corresponds with the \"toad-stones\" which are well\r\nknown at the present day in collections of old rings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.--The palate of the fossil fish Lepidotus,\r\nshowing the stud-like teeth in position. These are often found singly,\r\nand stained of a dull brown colour by the rock in which they were\r\nembedded. It was the colour of these fossil teeth, like that of a\r\ntoad's body, which led to the assertion that they were produced in the\r\nhead of the toad. _a._ A single detached tooth or \"toad-stone\" seen\r\nfrom the bright unattached surface. _b._ The same seen from the\r\nattached surface. _c._ A section of the tooth showing its cup-like\r\nshape. (Original drawings.)]\r\n\r\nI have examined twelve of these rings in the British Museum, through\r\nthe kindness of Sir Charles Read, P.S.A., the Keeper of Mediæval\r\nAntiquities, and four in the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford. Two of these\r\nare of chalcedony, with a figure of a toad roughly carved on the\r\nstone, and are of a character and origin different from the others.\r\nThe others, which are the true and recognised \"toad-stones\" or\r\n\"_Bufonius lapis_,\" are circular, slightly convex \"stones,\" of a drab\r\ncolour, with a smooth enamel-like surface. They are plate-like discs,\r\nbeing of thin substance and concave on the lower surface, which has an\r\nupstanding rim. I recognised them at once as the palatal teeth of a\r\nfossil fish called \"Lepidotus,\" common in our own oolitic and wealden\r\nstrata, and in rocks of that age all over the world. I give in Fig. 5\r\na drawing of a complete set of these teeth and of a single one\r\ndetached. They were white and colourless in life, but are stained of\r\nvarious colours according to the nature of the rock in which they were\r\nembedded. A drab colour like that of the skin of the common toad is\r\ngiven to them by the iron salts present in many oolitic rocks; those\r\nfound in the wealden of the Isle of Wight are black. That the\r\n\"toad-stones\" mounted in ancient rings are really the teeth of a fish\r\nhas been already recorded by the Rev. R. H. Newell (\"The Zoology of\r\nthe English Poets,\" 1845), but he seems to be mistaken in identifying\r\nthem with those of the wolf-fish (Anarrhicas). They undoubtedly are\r\nthe palatal teeth of the fossil extinct ganoid fish Lepidotus.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the queer inventions and assertions of the old writers\r\nabout these fossil teeth, which they declared to be taken out of the\r\ntoad's head, let me quote one delightful passage from a contemporary\r\nof Shakespeare (Lupton: \"A thousand notable things of sundry sortes.\r\nWhereof some are wonderful, some strange, some pleasant, divers\r\nnecessary, a great sort profitable, and many very precious,\" London,\r\n1595). \"You shall know,\" he says, \"whether the Toadstone called\r\n'crapaudina' be the right and perfect stone or not. Hold the stone\r\nbefore a toad, so that he may see it. And if it be a right and true\r\nstone, the toad will leap towards it and make as though he would\r\nsnatch it from you; he envieth so much that a man should have that\r\nstone. This was credibly told Mizaldus for truth by one of the French\r\nKing's physicians, which affirmed that he did see the trial thereof.\"\r\n\r\nWe have thus before us the actual things called toad-stones, and\r\nbelieved by Shakespeare and his contemporaries to be found in the head\r\nof the toad. How did it come about that these pretty little\r\nbutton-like, drab-coloured fossil teeth were given such an erroneous\r\nhistory? This question was answered by the late Rev. C. W. King,\r\nFellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, in his book on \"Antique Gems\"\r\n(London, 1860). He says, \"I am not aware if any substance of a stony\r\nnature is ever now discovered within the head or body of the toad.\r\nProbably the whole story originated in the name Batrachites\r\n(frog-stone or toad-stone), given in Pliny to a gem brought from\r\nCoptos, and so called from its resemblance to that animal in colour.\"\r\nWe have not, it must be noted, any specimens of the toad-stone at the\r\npresent day actually known to have been brought from Coptos. It is\r\nquite possible that the fossil fish-tooth was substituted ages ago for\r\nPliny's Batrachites, and was never found at Coptos at all! Whether\r\nthat is so or not, the fact is that Pliny never said it came out of a\r\ntoad, but merely that it was of the colour of a toad.\r\n\r\nThe Pliny referred to is Pliny the Elder, the celebrated Roman\r\nnaturalist who wrote a great treatise on natural history, which we\r\nstill possess, and died in A.D. 79 whilst visiting the eruption of\r\nVesuvius. He says nothing of the Batrachites being found inside the\r\ntoad, nor does he mention its medicinal virtues. The name\r\nalone--simply the name \"Batrachites,\" the Greek for toad-stone--was\r\nsufficient to lead the fertile imagination of the mediæval doctors to\r\ninvent all the other particulars! It is a case precisely similar to\r\nthat of the old lady who was credited with having vomited \"three black\r\ncrows.\" When the report was traced step by step to its source it was\r\nfound that her nurse had stated that she vomited something as black as\r\na crow!\r\n\r\nThe belief in the existence of a stone of magical properties in the\r\nhead of the toad is only one of the many instances of beliefs of a\r\nclosely similar kind which were accepted by Pliny (although he records\r\nno such belief as to the toad-stone), and were passed on from his\r\ntreatise on natural history in a more or less muddled form to the\r\nmiddle ages, and so to our own time by later writers. Thus Pliny\r\ncites, as stones possessing magical properties, the \"Bronte\" found in\r\nthe head of the tortoise, the Cinædia in the head of a fish of that\r\nname, the Chelonites, a grass-green stone found in a swallow's belly,\r\nthe Draconites, which must be cut out of the head of a live serpent,\r\nthe Hyænia from the eye of the Hyæna, and the Saurites from the bowels\r\nof a green lizard. All these and the Echites, or viper-stone, were\r\ncredited with extraordinary magical virtues, and many of the\r\nassertions of later writers about the toad-stone are clearly due to\r\ntheir having calmly transferred the marvellous stories about other\r\nimaginary stones to the imaginary toad-stone. The only stone in the\r\nabove list which has a real existence is that in the fish's head. Fish\r\nhave a pair of beautiful translucent stones in their heads--the\r\near-stones or otoliths--by the laminated structure of which we can now\r\ndetermine the age of a fish just as a tree's age is told by the annual\r\nrings of growth in the wood of its stem. The fresh-water crayfish has\r\na very curious pair of opaque stones (concretions of carbonate and\r\nphosphate of lime) formed in its gizzard as a normal and regular\r\nthing. They are familiar to every student who dissects a crayfish, and\r\nI am told that in Germany to-day, as in old times also, the\r\n\"krebstein\" is regarded by the country-folk as possessed of medicinal\r\nand magical properties. I am not able, on the present occasion, to\r\ntrace out the possible origin of all the stories and beliefs about\r\nstones occurring within animals. They are more numerous than those\r\ncited by Pliny; they exist in every race and every civilization and\r\nrefer to a large variety of animals. Probably many of these beliefs\r\ndate from prehistoric times. In the East the most celebrated of these\r\nstones, since the period of Arabic civilisation, is called a\r\nbezoar-stone, \"Bezoar\" is the Persian word for \"antidote,\" and does\r\nnot apply only to a stone. The true and original \"bezoar-stone\" of the\r\nEast is a concretion found in the intestine of the Persian wild goat.\r\nThose which I have seen are usually of the size and shape of a\r\npigeon's egg and of a fine mahogany colour, with a smooth, polished\r\nsurface. The Persian goat's bezoar-stone is found, on chemical\r\nanalysis, to consist of \"ellagic acid,\" an acid allied to gallic acid,\r\nthe vegetable astringent product which occurs in oak-galls used until\r\nlately in the manufacture of ink. The bezoar-stone is probably a\r\nconcretion formed in the intestine from some of the undigested\r\nportions of the goat's food. Such concretions are not uncommon, and\r\noccur even in man. \"Bezoar-stones\" are obtained in the East from deer,\r\nantelopes, and even monkeys, as well as goats, and must have a\r\ndifferent chemical nature in each case. Minute scrapings from these\r\nstones are used in the East as medicine, and their chemical qualities\r\nrender their use not altogether absurd, though they probably have not\r\nany really valuable action. It is probable that their use had a later\r\norigin than that of the \"stones\" connected with magic and witchcraft.\r\nSixteenth century writers, ever ready to invent a history when their\r\nknowledge was defective, declared the bezoar-stone to be formed by the\r\ninspissated tears of the deer or of the gazelle--the \"gum\" which\r\nHamlet remarked in aged examples of the human species.\r\n\r\nThe substance called \"ambergris\" (grey amber), valued to-day as a\r\nperfume, is a fæcal concretion similar to a bezoar-stone. It is formed\r\nin the intestine of the sperm-whale, and contains fragments of the\r\nhard parts of cuttle-fishes, which are the food of these whales.\r\n\"Hair-balls\" are formed in the intestines of various large vegetarian\r\nanimals--and occasionally stony concretions of various chemical\r\ncomposition are formed in the urinary bladder of various animals, as\r\nwell as of man. The \"eagle-stone\" is also a concretion to which\r\nmagical properties were ascribed. I have seen a specimen, but do not\r\nknow its history and origin. Glass beads found in prehistoric\r\nburial-places are called by old writers \"adders' eggs,\" and\r\n\"adder-stones,\" and were said (it is improbable that one should say\r\n\"believed\") to hatch out young adders when incubated with sufficiently\r\nsilly ceremonies and observances. A celebrated \"stone\" of medicinal\r\nreputation in the East is the \"goa-stone.\" This is a purely artificial\r\nproduct--a mass of the size and shape of a large egg, consisting of\r\nsome very fine and soft powder like fullers'-earth, sweetly scented,\r\nand overlaid with gold-leaf. A very little is rubbed off, mixed with\r\nwater, and swallowed, as a remedy for many diseases. The deep\r\nconnection of medicine with magic throwing light on the strange\r\napplication of stones and hairs, bones and skins, by imaginative\r\nmankind, in all ages and places, is exhibited in the common practice\r\nof writing with ink a sentence of the Koran (or other sacred words) on\r\na tablet, washing off the ink and making the patient swallow the water\r\nin which the sacred phrase has been thus dissolved! How convenient it\r\nwould be were it possible thus to impart knowledge, virtue, and health\r\nto suffering humanity!\r\n\r\nA good example of one of the ways in which magical properties become\r\nattributed to natural objects is the stone known as amethyst. The\r\nancient Indian name of this stone had the sound represented by its\r\npresent name. In Greek this sound happens to mean \"not intoxicated\";\r\nhence, without more ado, the ancients declared that the amethyst was a\r\npreventive of, and a cure for, drunkenness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nELEPHANTS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the novel by that clever but contradictious writer, Sam Butler,\r\nentitled \"The Way of All Flesh,\" an amiable and philosophically minded\r\nold gentleman, who pervades the story, states that when one feels\r\nworried or depressed by the incidents of one's daily life, great\r\ncomfort may be derived from an hour spent at the Zoological Gardens in\r\ncompany with the larger mammalia. He ascribes to them a remarkable\r\nsoothing influence, and I am inclined to agree with him. I am not\r\nprepared to decide whether the effect is due to the example of\r\npatience under adversity offered by these animals, or whether it is\r\nperhaps their tranquil indifference to everything but food, coupled\r\nwith their magnificent success in attaining to such dignity of size,\r\nwhich imposes upon me and fills me for a brief space with resignation\r\nand a child-like acquiescence in things as they are. The elephant\r\nstands first as a soothing influence, and then the giraffe, the latter\r\nhaving special powers, due to its beautiful eyes and agreeable\r\nperfume. Sometimes the hippopotamus may diffuse a charm of his own, an\r\naura of rotund obesity, especially when he is bathing or sleeping; but\r\nthere are moments when one has to flee from his presence. I never\r\ncould get on very well with rhinoceroses, but the large deer, bison,\r\nand wild cattle have the quality detected by Mr. Butler. So has the\r\ngorgeous, well-grown tiger, in full measure, when he purrs in answer\r\nto one's voice: but the lion is pompous, irritable, and easily upset.\r\nHe never purrs. He is unpleasantly and obscurely spotted. He seems to\r\nbe afraid of losing his dignity, and to be conscious of the fact that\r\nhis reputation--like that of some English officials--depends on the\r\noverpowering wig which he now wears, though his Macedonian forerunner\r\nhad no such growth to give an illusive appearance of size and capacity\r\nto his head. However opinions may differ about these things, we will\r\nagree that the elephant (or \"Oliphant,\" as he was called in France 400\r\nyears ago) is the most imposing, fascinating, and astonishing of all\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.--The Indian elephant (_Elephas maximus_ or\r\n_indicus_). Observe the small size of its ear-flap.]\r\n\r\nAt the present day there are two species only of elephant existing on\r\nthe earth's surface. These are the Indian (Fig. 6) (called _Elephas\r\nindicus_, but sometimes called _Elephas maximus_ on account of the\r\npriority which belongs to that designation, although the Indian\r\nelephant is smaller than the other), and the African (Fig. 7) (called\r\n_Elephas Africanus_). In the wild state their area of occupation has\r\nbecome greatly diminished within historic times. The Indian elephant\r\nwas hunted in Mesopotamia in the twelfth century B.C., and Egyptian\r\ndrawings of the eighteenth dynasty show elephants of this species\r\nbrought as tribute by Syrian vassals. To-day the Indian elephant is\r\nconfined to certain forests of Hindoostan, Ceylon, Burma, and Siam.\r\nThe African elephant extended 100 years ago all over South Africa, and\r\nin the days of the Carthaginians was found near the Mediterranean\r\nshore, whilst in prehistoric (late Pleistocene) times it existed in\r\nthe south of Spain and in Sicily. Now it is confined to the more\r\ncentral and equatorial zone of Africa, and is yearly receding before\r\nthe incursions and destructive attacks of civilised man.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.--The African elephant (_Elephas Africanus_)\r\nwith rider mounted on its back. The drawing is an enlarged\r\nrepresentation of an ancient Carthaginian coin.]\r\n\r\nAt no great distance of time before the historic period, earlier,\r\nindeed, than the times of the herdsmen who used polished stone\r\nimplements and raised great stone circles, namely, in the late\r\nPleistocene period, we find that there existed all over Europe and\r\nNorth Asia and the northern part of America another elephant very\r\nclosely allied to the Indian elephant, but having a bow-like outward\r\ncurvature of the tusks, their points finally directed towards one\r\nanother, and a thick growth of coarse hair all over the body. This is\r\n\"the mammoth,\" the remains of which are found in every river valley in\r\nEngland, France and Germany, and of which whole carcases are\r\nfrequently discovered in Northern Siberia, preserved from decay in the\r\nfrozen river gravels and \"silt.\" The ancient cave-men of France used\r\nthe fresh tusks of the mammoth killed on the spot for their carvings\r\nand engravings, and from their time to this the ivory of the mammoth\r\nhas been, and remains, in constant use. It is estimated that during\r\nthe last two centuries at least 100 pairs of mammoths' tusks have been\r\neach year exported from the frozen lands of Siberia. In early mediæval\r\ntimes the trade existed, and some ivory carvings and drinking horns of\r\nthat age appear to be fashioned from this more ancient ivory.\r\n\r\nAlready, then, within the human period we find elephants closely\r\nsimilar to those of our own time, far more numerous and more widely\r\ndistributed than in our own day, and happily established all over the\r\ntemperate regions of the earth--even in our Thames Valley and in the\r\nforests where London now spreads its smoky brickwork. When we go\r\nfurther back in time--as the diggings and surveying of modern man\r\nenable us to do--we find other elephants of many different species,\r\nsome differing greatly from the three species I have mentioned, and\r\nleading us back by gradual steps to a comparatively small animal,\r\nabout the size of a donkey, without the wonderful trunk or the immense\r\ntusks of the later elephants. By the discovery and study of these\r\nearlier forms we have within the last ten years arrived at a knowledge\r\nof the steps by which the elephant acquired in the course of long ages\r\n(millions of years) his \"proboscis\" (as the Greeks first called it),\r\nand I will later sketch that history.\r\n\r\nBut now let us first of all note some of the peculiarities of living\r\nelephants and the points by which the two kinds differ from one\r\nanother. The most striking fact about the elephant is its enormous\r\nsize. It is only exceeded among living animals by whales; it is far\r\nlarger than the biggest bull, or rhinoceros, or hippopotamus. A\r\nfair-sized Indian elephant weighs two to three tons (Jumbo, one of the\r\nAfrican species, weighed five), and requires as food 60 lb. of oats,\r\n1-1/2 truss of hay, 1-1/2 truss of corn a day, costing together in\r\nthis country about 5_s._; whereas a large cart-horse weighs 15 cwt.,\r\nand requires weekly three trusses of hay and 80 lb. of oats, costing\r\ntogether 12_s._ or about 1_s._ 8-1/2_d._ a day. It is this which has\r\nproved fatal to the elephant since man took charge of the world. The\r\nelephant requires so much food and takes so many years in growing up\r\n(twenty or more before he is old enough to be put to work), that it is\r\nonly in countries where there is a super-abundance of forest in which\r\nhe can be allowed to grow to maturity at his own \"charges\" (so to\r\nspeak) that it is worth while to attempt to domesticate and make use\r\nof him. For most purposes three horses are more \"handy\" than one\r\nelephant. The elephant is caught when he is already grown up, and then\r\ntrained. It is as a matter of economy that he is not bred in\r\nconfinement, and not because there is any insuperable difficulty in\r\nthe matter. Occasionally elephants have bred in menageries.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the African elephant at the present day grows\r\nto a larger size than the Indian, though it was the opinion of the\r\nRomans of the Empire that the Indian elephant was the more powerful,\r\ncourageous, and intelligent of the two. It seems next to impossible to\r\nacquire at the present day either specimens or trustworthy records of\r\nthe largest Indian elephants. About 10 ft. 6 ins. at the shoulder\r\nseems to be the maximum, though they are dressed up by their native\r\nowners with platforms and coverings to make them look bigger. In India\r\nthe skin of domesticated individuals is polished and carefully\r\nstained, like an old boot, by the assiduity of their guardians, so\r\nthat a museum specimen of exceptional size, fit for exhibition and\r\nstudy, cannot be obtained. On the other hand, the African elephant not\r\nunfrequently exceeds a height of 11 ft. at the shoulder. With some\r\ntrouble I obtained one exceeding this measurement direct from East\r\nAfrica for the Natural History Museum, where it now stands. It seems\r\nhighly probable that this species occasionally exceeds 12 ft. in\r\nheight. On the ground, between the great African elephant's fore and\r\nhind legs, in the museum, I placed a stuffed specimen of the smallest\r\nterrestrial mammal--the pigmy shrew-mouse. It is worth while thus\r\ncalling to mind that the little animal has practically every separate\r\nbone, muscle, blood-vessel, nerve, and other structure present in the\r\nhuge monster compared with it--is, in fact, built closely upon the\r\nsame plan, and yet is so much smaller that it is impossible to measure\r\none by the other. The mouse is only about one fifth the length of the\r\nelephant's eye. According to ancient Oriental fable, the mouse and the\r\ndragon were the only two animals of which the elephant was afraid.\r\n\r\nThe African elephant has much larger tusks relatively to his size than\r\nthe Indian, and both males and females have them, whereas the Indian\r\nfemale has none. A very fine Indian elephant's tusk weighs from 75 lb.\r\nto 80 lb. The record for an African elephant's tusk was (according to\r\nstandard books) 180 lb. But I obtained ten years ago for the museum,\r\nwhere it now may be seen, an African elephant's tusk weighing 228-1/2\r\nlb. Its fellow weighed a couple of pounds less. It measures 10 ft. 2\r\nin. in length along the curvature. This tusk was recognised by Sir\r\nHenry Stanley's companion, Mr. Jephson, when he was with me in the\r\nmuseum, as actually one which he had last seen in the centre of\r\nAfrica. He told me that he had, in fact, weighed and measured this\r\ntusk in the treasury of Emin Pasha, in Central Africa, when he went\r\nwith Stanley to bring Emin down to the coast. As will be remembered,\r\nEmin had no wish to go to the coast, but returned to his province. He\r\nwas subsequently attacked and murdered by an Arab chief, who\r\nappropriated his store of ivory, and in the course of time had it\r\nconveyed to the ivory market at Zanzibar. The date of the purchase\r\nthere of the museum specimen corresponds with the history given by Mr.\r\nJephson.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.--The crowns of three \"grinders\" or molars of\r\nelephants compared. A is that of an extinct mastodon with four\r\ntransverse ridges; B is that of the African elephant with nine ridges\r\nin use and ground flat; C is that of the mammoth with sixteen narrow\r\nridges in use--the rest, some eight in number, are at the left hand of\r\nthe figure and not yet in use.]\r\n\r\nThe African elephant (as could be seen by comparing the small one\r\nliving in Regent's Park with its neighbours) has a sloping forehead\r\ngraduating into the trunk or proboscis, instead of the broad, upright\r\nbrow of the Indian. He also has very much larger ears, which lie\r\nagainst the shoulders (except when he is greatly excited) like a short\r\ncape or cloak (see Fig. 7). These great ears differ somewhat in shape\r\nin the elephants of different parts of Africa, and local races can be\r\ndistinguished by the longer or shorter angle into which the flap is\r\ndrawn out. The grinding teeth of the two elephants differ very\r\nmarkedly, but one must see these in a museum. The grinders are very\r\nlarge and long (from behind forwards), coming into place one after the\r\nother. Each grinder occupies, when fully in position, the greater part\r\nof one side of the upper or of the lower jaw. They are crossed from\r\nright to left by ridges of enamel, like a series of mountains and\r\nvalleys, which gradually wear down by rubbing against those of the\r\ntooth above or below. The biggest grinder of the Indian elephant has\r\ntwenty-four of these transverse ridges, whilst that of the African has\r\nonly eleven, which are therefore wider apart (see Fig. 8). An extinct\r\nkind of elephant--the mastodon--had only five such ridges on its\r\nbiggest grinders, and four or only three on the others. Other\r\nancestral elephants had quite ordinary-looking grinders, with only two\r\nor three irregular ridges or broad tubercles. Both the Indian and\r\nAfrican elephant have hairless, rough, very hard, wrinkled skins. But\r\nthe new-born young are covered with hair, and some Indian elephants\r\nliving in cold, mountainous regions appear to retain a certain amount\r\nof hair through life. The mammoth (which agreed with the Indian\r\nelephant in the number of ridges on its grinders and in other points)\r\nlived in quite cold, sub-Arctic conditions, at a time when glaciers\r\ncompletely covered Scandinavia and the north of our islands as well as\r\nmost of Germany. It retained a complete coat of coarse hair throughout\r\nlife. The young of our surviving elephants only exhibit transitorily\r\nthe family tendency.\r\n\r\nThe last mammoth probably disappeared from the area which is now Great\r\nBritain about 150,000 years ago. It might be supposed that no elephant\r\nwas seen in England again until the creation of \"menageries\" and\r\n\"zoological gardens\" within the last two or three hundred years. This,\r\nhowever, is by no means the case. The Italians in the middle ages, and\r\nthrough them the French and the rulers of Central Europe, kept\r\nmenageries and received as presents, or in connection with their trade\r\nwith the East and their relations with Eastern rulers, frequent\r\nspecimens of strange beasts from distant lands. Our King Henry I, had\r\na menagerie at Woodstock, where he kept a porcupine, lions, leopards,\r\nand a camel! The Emperor Charlemagne received in 803 A.D. from Haroun\r\nal Raschid, the Caliph of Bagdad, an elephant named Abulabaz. It was\r\nbrought to Aix-la-Chapelle by Isaac the Jew, and died suddenly in 810.\r\nSome four and a half centuries later (in 1257), Louis IX, of France,\r\nreturning from the Holy Land, sent as a special and magnificent\r\npresent to Henry III, King of England (according to the chronicle of\r\nMatthew Paris), an elephant which was exhibited at the Tower of\r\nLondon. It was supposed by the chronicler to be the first ever brought\r\nto England, and indeed the first to be taken beyond Italy, for he did\r\nnot know of Charlemagne's specimen. In 1591 King Henry IV of France,\r\nwishing to be very polite to Queen Elizabeth of England, and\r\napparently rather troubled by the expense of keeping the beast\r\nhimself, sent to her, having heard that she would like to have it, an\r\nelephant which had been brought from the \"Indies\" and landed at\r\nDieppe. He declared it to be the first which had ever come into\r\nFrance, but presented it to Her Majesty \"as I would most willingly\r\npresent anything more excellent did I possess it.\" Thenceforward\r\nelephants were from time to time exhibited at the Tower, together with\r\nlions and other strange beasts acquired by the Crown.\r\n\r\nNone of these elephants were, however, \"the first who ever burst\" into\r\nremote Britain after the mammoths had disappeared, and we were\r\nseparated from Europe by the geological changes which gave us the\r\nEnglish Channel--La Manche. Though Julius Cæsar himself does not\r\nmention it, it is definitely stated by a writer on strategy named\r\nPolyænus, a friend of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius, but not, I am sorry\r\nto say, an authority to whose statements historians attach any serious\r\nvalue--that Cæsar made use of an elephant armed with iron plates and\r\ncarrying on its back a tower full of armed men to terrify the ancient\r\nBritons when he crossed the Thames--an operation which he carried out,\r\nI believe, somewhere between Molesey and Staines.\r\n\r\nElephants are often spoken of as \"Ungulates,\" and classed by\r\nnaturalists with the hoofed animals (the odd toed tapirs,\r\nrhinoceroses, and horses, and the even-toed pigs, camel, cattle, and\r\ndeer). But there is not much to say in defence of such an association.\r\nThe elephants have, as a matter of fact, not got hoofs, and they have\r\nfive toes on each foot. The five toes of the front foot have each a\r\nnail, whilst usually only four toes of the hind foot have nails. A\r\nspeciality of the elephant is the great circular pad of thick skin\r\noverlying fat and fibrous tissue, which forms the sole of the foot and\r\nbears the animal's enormous weight. This buffer-like development of\r\nthe foot existed in some great extinct mammals (the Dinoceras family,\r\nof North America), but is altogether different from the support given\r\nby a horse's hoof or the paired shoe-like hoofs of great cattle or\r\nthe three rather elegant hoofed toes of the rhinoceros.\r\n\r\nThe Indian elephant likes good, solid ground to walk on, and when he\r\nfinds himself in a boggy place will seize any large objects\r\n(preferably big branches of trees) and throw them under his feet to\r\nprevent himself sinking in. Occasionally he will remove the stranger\r\nwho is riding on his back and make use of him in this way. The\r\ncircumference of the African elephant's fore-foot is found by hunters\r\nto be half the animal's height at the shoulder, and is regarded as\r\nfurnishing a trustworthy indication of his stature.\r\n\r\nThe legs of the elephant differ from those of more familiar large\r\nanimals in the fact that the ankle and the wrist (the so-called knee\r\nof the horse's foreleg) are not far above the sole of the foot\r\n(resembling man's joints in this respect), whilst the true knee-joint\r\n(called \"the stifle\" in horses)--instead of being, as in horses, high\r\nup, close against the body, strongly flexed even when at rest, and\r\nobscured by the skin--is far below the body, free and obvious enough.\r\nIn fact, the elephant keeps the thigh and the upper arm perpendicular\r\nand in line with the lower segment of the limb when he is standing, so\r\nthat the legs are pillar-like. But he bends the joints amply when in\r\nquick movement. The hind legs seen in action resemble, in the\r\nproportions of thigh, foreleg, and foot, and the bending at the knee\r\nand ankle, very closely those of a man walking on \"all fours.\" The\r\nelephant as known in Europe more than 300 years ago was rarely seen in\r\nfree movement. He was kept chained up in his stall, resting on his\r\nstraight, pillar-like legs and their pad-like feet. And with that\r\ncurious avidity for the marvellous which characterized serious writers\r\nin those days to the exclusion of any desire or attempt to ascertain\r\nthe truth, it was coolly asserted, and then commonly believed, that\r\nthe elephant could not bend his legs. Shakespeare--who, of course, is\r\nmerely using a common belief of his time as a chance illustration of\r\nhuman character--makes Ulysses say (referring to his own stiffness of\r\ncarriage) (\"Troilus and Cressida,\" Act II) \"The elephant hath joints,\r\nbut none for courtesy; his legs are legs for necessity, not for\r\nflexure.\" An old writer says: \"The elephant hath no joints, and, being\r\nunable to lye down, it lieth against a tree, which, the hunters\r\nobserving, do saw almost asunder; whereon the beast relying--by the\r\nfall of the tree falls also down itself, and is able to rise no more.\"\r\nAnother old writer (Bartholomew, 1485), says, more correctly: \"When\r\nthe elephant sitteth he bendeth his feet; he bendeth the hinder legs\r\nright as a man.\"\r\n\r\nA writer of 120 years later in date (Topsell) says: \"In the River\r\nGanges there are blue worms of sixty cubits long having two arms;\r\nthese when the elephants come to drink in that river take their trunks\r\nin their hands and pull them off. At the sight of a beautiful woman\r\nelephants leave off all rage and grow meek and gentle. In Africa there\r\nare certain springs of water which, if at any time they dry up, they\r\nare opened and recovered again by the teeth of elephants.\" The blue\r\nworm of the Ganges referred to is no doubt the crocodile; both in\r\nIndia and Africa animals coming to the rivers to drink are seized by\r\nlurking crocodiles, who fix their powerful jaws on to the face (snout\r\nor muzzle) of the drinking animal and drag it under the water. Thus\r\nthe fable has arisen of the origin of the elephant's trunk as\r\nrecounted by Mr. Rudyard Kipling. A young elephant (before the days of\r\ntrunks), according to this authority, when drinking at a riverside had\r\nhis moderate and well-shaped snout seized by a crocodile. The little\r\nelephant pulled and the crocodile pulled, and by the help of a\r\nfriendly python the elephant got the best of it. He extricated himself\r\nfrom the jaws of death. But, oh! what a difference in his appearance!\r\nHis snout was drawn out so as to form that wonderful elongated thing\r\nwith two nostrils at the end which we call the elephant's trunk, and\r\nwas henceforth transmitted (a first-rate example of an \"acquired\r\ncharacter\") to future generations! The real origin of the elephant's\r\ntrunk is (as I will explain later) a different one from that handed\r\ndown to us in the delightful jungle-book. I do not believe in the\r\nhereditary transmission of acquired modifications!\r\n\r\nTopsell may or may not be right as to the result produced on elephants\r\nby the sight of a beautiful woman. In Africa the experiment would be a\r\ndifficult one, and even in India inconclusive. Topsell seems, however,\r\nto have come across correct information about the digging for water by\r\nan African elephant by the use of his great tusks--those tusks for the\r\ngain of which he is now being rapidly exterminated by man. Serious\r\ndrought is frequent in Africa, and a cause of death to thousands of\r\nanimals. African elephants, working in company, are known to have\r\nexcavated holes in dried-up river beds to the depth of 25 feet in a\r\nsingle night in search of water. It is probable that the Indian\r\nelephant's tusk would not be of service in such digging, and it is to\r\nbe noted that he is rather an inhabitant of high ground and\r\ntable-lands than of tropical plains liable to flood and to drought.\r\nThe tusk of the Indian elephant has become merely a weapon of attack\r\nfor the male, and there are even local breeds in which it is absent in\r\nthe males as well as in the females. The mammoth was a near cousin of\r\nthe Indian elephant, and inhabited cold uplands and the fringes of\r\nsub-Arctic forests, on which he fed. His tusks were very large, and\r\ncurved first outward and then inward at the tips. They would not have\r\nserved for heavy digging, and probably were used for forcing a way\r\nthrough the forest and as a protection to the face and trunk.\r\n\r\nThe trunk of the elephant was called \"a hand\" by old writers, and it\r\nseems to have acted in the development of the elephant's intelligence\r\nin the same way as man's hand has in regard to his mental growth,\r\nthough in a less degree. The Indian elephant has a single tactile and\r\ngrasping projection (sometimes called \"a finger\") placed above between\r\nthe two nostrils at the end of the trunk; the African elephant has one\r\nabove and one below. I have seen the elephant pick up with this\r\nwonderful trunk with equal facility a heavy man and then a threepenny\r\npiece.\r\n\r\nThe intelligence of the elephant is sometimes exaggerated by reports\r\nand stories; sometimes it is not sufficiently appreciated. It is not\r\nfair to compare the intelligence of the elephant with that of the\r\ndog--bred and trained by man for thousands of years. So far as one can\r\njudge, there is no wild animal, excepting the higher apes, which\r\nexhibits so much and such varied intelligence as the elephant. It\r\nappears that from early tertiary times (late Eocene) the ancestors of\r\nelephants have had large brains, whilst, when we go back so far as\r\nthis, the ancestors of nearly all other animals had brains a quarter\r\nof the size (and even less in proportion to body-size) which their\r\nmodern representatives have. Probably the early possession of a large\r\nbrain at a geological period when brains were as a rule small is what\r\nhas enabled the elephants not only to survive until to-day, but to\r\nspread over the whole world (except Australia), and to develop an\r\nimmense variety and number of individuals throughout the tertiary\r\nseries in spite of their ungainly size. It is only the yet bigger\r\nbrain of man which (would it were not so!) is now at last driving this\r\nlovable giant, this vast compound of sagacity and strength, out of\r\nexistence. The elephant--like man standing on his hind legs--has a\r\nwide survey of things around him owing to his height. He can take time\r\nto allow of cerebral intervention in his actions since he is so large\r\nthat he has little cause to be afraid and to hurry. He has a fine and\r\ndelicate exploring organ in his trunk, with its hand-like termination;\r\nwith this he can, and does, experiment and builds up his individual\r\nknowledge and experience. Elephants act together in the wild state,\r\naiding one another to uproot trees too large for one to deal with\r\nalone. They readily understand and accept the guidance of man, and\r\nwith very small persuasion and teaching execute very dextrous\r\nwork--such as the piling of timber. If man had selected the more\r\nintelligent elephants for breeding over a space of a couple of\r\nthousand years a prodigy of animal intelligence would have resulted.\r\nBut man has never \"bred\" the elephant at all.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks and Romans knew ivory first, and then became acquainted\r\nwith the elephant. The island of Elephantina in the Nile was from the\r\nearliest times a seat of trade in the ivory tusks of the African\r\nelephant, and so acquired its name. Herodotus is the first to mention\r\nthe elephant itself; Homer only refers to the ivory by the word\r\n\"elephas.\" Aristotle in this, as in other matters, is more correct\r\nthan later writers. He probably received first-hand information about\r\nthe elephant from Alexander and some of his men after their Indian\r\nexpedition. The Romans had an unpleasant first personal experience of\r\nelephants when Pyrrhus, King of Epirus, landed a number with his army\r\nand put the Roman soldiers to flight. But the Romans then, and\r\ncontinually in after-times, showed their cool heads and sound judgment\r\nin a certain contempt for elephants as engines of war. They soon\r\nlearned to dig pits on the battlefield to entrap the great beasts, and\r\nthey deliberately made for the elephants' trunks, hewing them through\r\nwith their swords, so that the agonised and maddened creatures turned\r\nround and trampled down the troops of their own side. The Romans only\r\nused them subsequently to terrify barbaric people, and as features in\r\nmilitary processions. But Eastern nations used them extensively in\r\nwar. In A.D. 217 Antiochus the Great brought 217 elephants in his army\r\nagainst 73 employed by Ptolemy, at what was called \"the Battle of the\r\nElephants.\" The battle commenced by the charging head to head of the\r\nopposing elephants and the discharge of arrows, spears and stones by\r\nthe men in the towers on their backs.\r\n\r\nAn interesting question has been raised as to whether the elephants\r\nused by the Carthaginians were the African species or the Indian.\r\nThere is no doubt that the elephants of Pyrrhus and those known to\r\nAlexander were the Indian, though they were taken in those days much\r\nto the West of India, namely, in Mesopotamia, and it would not have\r\nbeen difficult for the Carthaginians to convey Indian elephants, which\r\nhad certainly been brought as far as Egypt, along the Mediterranean\r\ncoast. An unfounded prejudice as to the want of docility of the\r\nAfrican elephant has favoured the notion that the Carthaginians used\r\nthe Indian elephant. As a matter of fact, no one in modern times has\r\ntried to train the African elephant, except here and there in a\r\nzoological garden. Probably the Indian \"mahout,\" or elephant trainer\r\ncould, if he were put to it, do as much with an African as he does\r\nwith an Indian elephant. It would be an interesting experiment. In the\r\nnext place, there is decisive evidence that it was the African\r\nelephant which the Carthaginians used, since we have a Carthaginian\r\ncoin (Fig. 7) on which is beautifully represented--in unmistakable\r\nmodelling--the African elephant, with his large triangular cape-like\r\nears and his sloping forehead. In the time of Hannibal there were\r\nstables for over 300 of these elephants at Carthage, and he took fifty\r\nwith him to the South of France with his army for the Italian\r\ninvasion. He only got thirty-seven safely over the Rhone, and all but\r\na dozen or so died in the terrible passage of the Alps. After the\r\nbattle of Trebia he had only eight left, and when he had crossed the\r\nApennines there was only one still alive. On this Hannibal himself\r\nrode.\r\n\r\nSince the period when the white chalk which now forms our cliffs and\r\nhills was deposited at the bottom of a vast and deep ocean--the sea\r\nbottom has been raised, the chalk has emerged and risen on the top of\r\nhills to 800 feet in height in our own islands, and to ten times that\r\nheight elsewhere, and during that process sands and clays and shelly\r\ngravels have been deposited to the thickness of some 2,800 feet by\r\nseas and estuaries and lakes, which have come and gone on the face of\r\nEurope and of other parts of the world as it has slowly sunk and\r\nslowly risen again. The last 200 feet or so of deposits we call the\r\nPleistocene or Quaternary; the rest are known as the Tertiary strata.\r\nThey are only a small part of the total thickness of aqueous deposit\r\nof stratified rock--which amounts to 60,000 feet more before the\r\nearliest remains of life in the Cambrian beds are reached, whilst\r\nolder than, and therefore below this, we have another 50,000 feet of\r\nwater-made rock which yields no fossils--no remains of living things,\r\nthough living things were certainly there! Our little layer of\r\nTertiary strata on the top is, however, very important. It took\r\nseveral million years in forming, although it is only one-fortieth of\r\nthe whole thickness of aqueous deposit on the crust of the earth. We\r\ndivide it into Pliocene, Miocene, and Eocene, and each of these into\r\nupper, middle, and lower, the Eocene being the oldest. Our London clay\r\nand Woolwich sands are lower Eocene; there is a good deal of Miocene\r\nin Switzerland and Germany, whilst the Pliocene is represented by\r\nwhole provinces of Italy, parts of central France, and by the White\r\nand Red \"crags\" of Suffolk.[5]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.--Skeleton of the Indian elephant. Only four\r\ntoes are visible, the fifth concealed owing to the view from the\r\nside.]\r\n\r\nIt is during this Tertiary period that the mammals--the warm-blooded,\r\nhairy quadrupeds, which suckle their young--have developed (they had\r\ncome into existence a good deal earlier), and we find the remains of\r\nancestral forms of the living kinds of cattle, pigs, horses,\r\nrhinoceroses, tapirs, elephants, lions, wolves, bears, etc., embedded\r\nin the successive layers of Tertiary deposits. Naturally enough, those\r\nmost like the present animals are found in late Pliocene, and those\r\nwhich are close to the common ancestors of many of the later kinds are\r\nfound in the Eocene, whilst we also find, at various levels of the\r\nTertiary deposit, remains of side-branches of the mammalian pedigree,\r\nwhich, though including very powerful and remarkable beasts, have left\r\nno line of descent to represent them at the present day. We have been\r\nable to trace the great modern one-toed horses, zebras, and asses,\r\nwith their complicated pattern of grinding-teeth back by quite gradual\r\nsteps (represented by the bones and teeth of fossil kinds of horses),\r\nto smaller three-toed animals with simpler tuberculated teeth, and\r\neven, without any marked break in the series, to a small Eocene animal\r\n(not bigger than a spaniel) with four equal-sized toes on its front\r\nfoot, and three on its hind foot. We know, too, a less direct series\r\nof intermediate forms leading beyond this to an animal with five toes\r\non each foot and \"typical\" teeth. In fact, no one doubts that\r\n(leaving aside a few difficult and doubtful cases) all such big\r\nexisting mammals, as I mentioned above, as well as monkeys and man,\r\nare derived from small mammals--intermediate in most ways between a\r\nhedgehog and a pig--which flourished in very early Eocene times, and\r\nhad five toes on each foot, and \"a typical dentition.\" Even the\r\nelephants came from such a small ancestral form. The common notion\r\nthat the extinct forerunners of existing animals were much bigger than\r\nrecent kinds, and even gigantic, is not in accordance with fact. Some\r\nextinct animals were of very great size--especially the great reptiles\r\nof the period long before the Tertiaries, and before the chalk. But\r\nthe recent horse, the recent elephant, the giraffe, the lions, bears,\r\nand others, are bigger--some much bigger--than the ancestral forms, to\r\nwhich we can trace them by the wonderfully preserved and wonderfully\r\ncollected and worked-out fossilised bones discovered in the successive\r\nlayers of the Pliocene, Miocene, and Eocene strata, leading us as we\r\ndescend to more primitive, simplified, and smaller ancestors.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand the initial character of the foot of the\r\nearly ancestral mammals. It had five toes. By the suppression or\r\natrophy of first the innermost toe, then of the outermost, you find\r\nthat mammals may first acquire four toes only, and then only three,\r\nand by repeating the process the toes may be reduced to two, or right\r\naway to one, the original middle toe. There is no special difficulty\r\nabout tracing back the elephants in so far as this matter is\r\nconcerned, since they have kept (like man and some other mammals) the\r\nfull typical complement of five toes on each foot.\r\n\r\nBut I must explain a little more at length what was the \"typical\r\ndentition,\"--that is to say, the exact number and form of the teeth in\r\neach half of the upper and the lower jaw of the early mammalian\r\nancestor of lower Eocene times, or just before. The jaws were drawn\r\nout into a snout or muzzle, an elongated, protruding \"face,\" as in a\r\ndog or deer or hedgehog, and there were numerous teeth set in a row\r\nalong the gums of the upper and the lower jaw. The teeth were the same\r\nin number, in upper and in lower jaw, and so formed as to work\r\ntogether, those of the lower jaw shutting as a rule just a little in\r\nfront of the corresponding teeth of the upper jaw. There were above\r\nand below, in front, six small chisel-like teeth, which we call \"the\r\nincisors.\" At the corner of the mouth above and below on each side\r\nflanking these was a corner tooth, or dog-tooth, a little bigger than\r\nthe incisors, and more pointed and projecting. These we call \"the\r\ncanines,\" four in all. Then we turn the corner of the mouth-front, as\r\nit were, and come to the \"grinders,\" cheek-teeth or molars. These are\r\nplaced in a row along each half of upper and lower jaw. In our early\r\nmammalian ancestor they were seven in number, with broader crowns than\r\nthe peg-like incisors and canines, the bright polished enamel of the\r\ncrown being raised up into two, three or four cone-like prominences.\r\nThe back grinders are broader and bigger than those nearer the\r\ndog-tooth. The three hindermost grinders in each half of each jaw are\r\nnot replaced by \"second\" teeth, whilst all the other teeth are.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.--The teeth in the upper and lower jaw-bone of\r\nthe common pig--drawn from photographs. A and B represent the right\r\nhalf of the lower jaw (A) and the right half of the upper jaw (B) seen\r\nin horizontal position. _Inc._ are the incisors or chisel-like front\r\nteeth, three in number, in each half of each jaw and marked 1, 2, 3.\r\n_C_ marks the canine or dog-tooth, which here grows to be a large\r\ntusk. The molars, \"grinders,\" or cheek teeth are marked 1 to 7. Figs.\r\nC and D give a side view of the left halves of the upper (C) and of\r\nthe lower jaw-bone (D), with the teeth in place. The bone has been\r\npartly cut away so as to show the fangs or roots of the teeth, which\r\nare double in the molars, and even threefold in molar No. 7. The\r\nexplanation of the lettering is the same as that given for Figs. A and\r\nB. The letter _p_ in Fig. B points to a \"foramen\" or hole in the upper\r\njaw-bone. These drawings are introduced here as showing the _complete_\r\nnumber of teeth which the ancestor of pigs, goats, elephants, dogs,\r\ntigers, men, and even whales possessed. The reduction in number and\r\nthe alteration in the shape of the primitive full set of teeth is\r\nreferred to in the present chapter on \"Elephants,\" and in those on\r\n\"Vegetarians and their Teeth\" (p. 102), and on \"A Strange Extinct\r\nBeast\" (p. 92).]\r\n\r\nNow this typical set of teeth--consisting of twenty-eight grinders,\r\nfour canines, and twelve incisors--is not found complete in many\r\nmammals at the present day, though it is found more frequently as we\r\ngo back to earlier strata.[6] Though some mammals have kept close to\r\nthe original number, they have developed peculiar shape and qualities\r\nin some of the teeth as well as changes in size. The common pig still\r\nkeeps the typical number (Fig. 10), but he has developed the corner\r\nteeth or canines into enormous tusks both in the upper and lower jaw,\r\nand the more anterior grinders have become quite minute. The cats\r\n(lions and tigers included) have kept the full number of incisors (see\r\nFigs. 21 and 22, pp. 103, 104); they have developed the four canines\r\ninto enormous and deadly stabbing \"fangs,\" and they have lost all the\r\ngrinders but three in each half of the lower jaw and four in each half\r\nof the upper jaw (twelve instead of twenty-eight), and these have\r\nbecome sharp-edged so as to be scissor-like in their action, instead\r\nof crushing or grinding. Man and the old-world monkeys have lost an\r\nincisor in each half of each jaw (see Pls. VI and VII); they retain\r\nthe canines, but have only five molars in each half of each jaw\r\n(twenty in all instead of twenty-eight). Most of the mammals--whatever\r\nchange of number and shape has befallen their teeth in adaptation to\r\ntheir different requirements as to the kind of food and mode of\r\ngetting it--have retained a good long pair of jaws and a snout or\r\nmuzzle consisting of nose, upper jaw, and lower jaw, projecting well\r\nin front of the eyes and brain-case. Man is remarkable as an\r\nexception. In the higher races of men the jaws are shorter than in the\r\nlower races, and project but very little beyond the vertical plane of\r\nthe eyes, whilst the nose projects beyond the lips. Another exception\r\nis the elephant. This is most obvious when the prepared bony skull and\r\nlower jaw are examined, but can be sufficiently clearly seen in the\r\nliving animal. The lower jaw and the part of the upper jaw against\r\nwhich it and its grinders play is extraordinarily short and small. The\r\nelephant has, in fact, no projecting bony jaw at all, no bony snout,\r\nits chin does not project more than that of an old man, and even the\r\npart of the upper jaw into which its great tusks are set does not bend\r\nforward far from the perpendicular (Fig. 9).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.--A reconstruction of the extinct American\r\nmastodon (_Mastodon ohioticus_) from a drawing by Prof. Osborne. Other\r\nextinct species of mastodon are found in Europe.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.--A. Skull, and B. restored outline of the head\r\nof the long-jawed extinct elephant called Tetrabelodon--the name\r\nreferring to its four large tusks--two above and two below.]\r\n\r\nThe elephant (see Fig. 9) has no sign of the six little front teeth\r\n(incisors) above and below which we find in the typical dentition and\r\nin many living mammals, nor of the corner teeth (dog-teeth, or\r\ncanines). In the upper jaw in front there is the one huge tusk on\r\neach side, and in the lower jaw no front teeth at all! Then as to the\r\ngrinders. In the elephant these are enormous, with many transverse\r\nridges on the elongated crown, and so big that there is only room for\r\none at a time in each half of upper and lower jaw. Six of these\r\nsucceed one another in each half of each jaw, and correspond (though\r\ngreatly altered) to six of the seven grinders of the typical\r\ndentition. Are there amongst older fossil elephants and animals like\r\nelephants any which have an intermediate condition of the teeth,\r\nconnecting the extremely peculiar teeth of the modern elephants with\r\nthe typical dentition such as is approached by the pig, the dog, the\r\ntapir, and the hedgehog? There are such links. We know a great many\r\nelephants from Pleistocene and Pliocene strata--some from European\r\nlocalities, more from India, and some from America. A little elephant\r\nnot more than 3 feet high when adult is found fossil in the island of\r\nMalta; other species were a little larger than the living African\r\nelephant. Whilst the Indian elephant has as many as twenty-four\r\ncross-ridges on its biggest grinding tooth (Fig. 8) there is a fossil\r\nkind which has only six such ridges. But besides true elephants we\r\nknow from the Pliocene, Miocene, and Upper Eocene of the old world,\r\nthe remains of elephant-like creatures (some as big as true\r\nelephants), which are distinguished by the name \"Mastodon\" (Fig. 11).\r\nAnd, in fact, we are conducted through a series of changes of form by\r\nancient elephant-like creatures which are of older and older date as\r\nwe pass along the series, and are known as (1) Mastodon, (2)\r\nTetrabelodon, (3) Palæomastodon, (4) Meritherium, until we come to\r\nsomething approaching the general form of skull and skeleton and the\r\ntypical dentition of the early mammalian ancestor. Mastodons of\r\nseveral species are found in Pliocene strata in Europe and Asia;\r\ndetached teeth are found in Suffolk. One species actually survived\r\n(why, we do not know) in North America into the early human period,\r\nand whole skeletons of it are dug out from the morasses such as that\r\nof \"Big-bone Lick.\" The Mastodons had a longer jaw and face than the\r\nelephants, though closely allied to them. They bring one nearer to\r\nordinary mammals in that fact, and also in having (when young) two\r\nfront teeth or incisors in the lower jaw. Their grinders had the\r\ncrowns less elongated than those of the elephants, and there were only\r\nfive cross-ridges--on the biggest--and these ridges tend to divide\r\ninto separate cones (Fig. 8). So here, too, we are approaching the\r\nordinary mammals, of which we may keep the pig and the tapir in mind\r\nas samples. But the Mastodons still had the great trunk and huge tusks\r\nof the elephants.\r\n\r\nNext we must look at Tetrabelodon (Fig. 12), and it is this creature\r\nwhich has really revealed the history of the strange metamorphosis by\r\nwhich elephants were produced. The Tetrabelodon is known as \"the\r\nlong-jawed mastodon,\" because, as was shown in a wonderfully\r\nwell-preserved skeleton from the lower Pliocene of the centre of\r\nFrance, set up in the Paris Museum, it had a lower jaw of enormous\r\nlength, ending in two large horizontally directed teeth (Fig. 12).\r\nInstead of a lower jaw a foot long, as in an elephant or in the common\r\nkind of mastodon--this long-jawed kind had a lower jaw 5 feet or 6\r\nfeet long! The tusks of the upper jaw were large, and nearly\r\nhorizontal in direction, bent downwards a little on each side of the\r\nlong lower jaw. This lower jaw seemed incomprehensible, almost a\r\nmonstrosity--until it occurred to me that it exactly corresponds to\r\nthe elongated upper lip and nose which we call the elephant's\r\ntrunk--and that the trunk of \"Tetrabelodon\" must have rested on his\r\nlong lower jaw. In descending to Tetrabelodon we leave behind us the\r\nelephants with hanging unsupported trunk; the lower jaw here is of\r\nsufficient length to support the great trunk. When the lower jaw\r\nshortened in the later mastodons and elephants the trunk did not\r\nshorten too, but remained free and depending, capable of large\r\nmovement and of grasping with its extremity. Photographs, casts, and\r\nactual specimens of the extraordinary skull of the long-jawed mastodon\r\nor Tetrabelodon and of the creatures mentioned below may be seen in\r\nthe Natural History Museum.\r\n\r\nLastly we have the wonderful series of discoveries made about twelve\r\nyears ago by Dr. Andrews (of the Natural History Museum) of\r\nelephant-like creatures in the upper Eocene of the Fayoum Desert of\r\nEgypt. Palæomastodon (the name given by Dr. Andrews to one of them) is\r\na \"pig-like\" mastodon, with an elongated, bony face, the tusks of\r\nmoderate size, and the lower jaw not projecting more than a few inches\r\nbeyond them, so that the proboscis is quite short and rests well on it\r\n(Fig. 13). This animal had six moderate sized grinders (molars or\r\ncheek-teeth) on each side of each jaw in position simultaneously, as\r\nmay be seen in the complete skull shown in Fig. 14. Of other teeth it\r\nhad only the two moderate-sized front tusks above and two very big,\r\nchisel-like \"incisors\" in the front of the lower jaw. Exactly how\r\nthese were used and for what food no one has yet made out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.--Head of the ancestral elephant--Palæomastodon--as\r\nit appeared in life. It shows, as compared with the earlier ancestor,\r\nan elongation both of the snout and the lower jaws. The tusk in the\r\nupper jaw has increased in size, but is still small as compared with\r\nthat of later elephants. (After a drawing by Prof. Osborne.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.--Restored model of the skull and lower jaw of\r\nthe ancestral elephant Palæomastodon from the upper Eocene strata of\r\nthe Fayoum Desert, Egypt. It shows the six molar teeth of the upper\r\nand lower jaw (left side), the tusk-like upper incisors and the large\r\nchisel-like lower incisors in front.]\r\n\r\nThe remains, which finally bring the elephants into line with the\r\nordinary mammals with typical dentition, were discovered also by Dr.\r\nAndrews and named \"Meritherium\" by him, signifying \"the beast of the\r\nLake Meris.\" This creature is not bigger than a tapir, and had the\r\nshape of head and face which we see in that and the ordinary hoofed\r\nanimals (Fig. 15). It had no trunk, and whilst it had six small and\r\nsimplified mastodon-like grinders in each half of each jaw, it had six\r\nincisors in the upper jaw and a canine or corner tooth on each side.\r\nIn the lower jaw there were only two large incisors besides the\r\ncheek-teeth or grinders. Not the least interesting point about\r\nMeritherium is that it tells us which of the front upper teeth have\r\nbecome the huge tusks of the later elephants. Counting from the middle\r\nline there are in Meritherium three incisors right and three left. The\r\nsecond of these upper teeth on each side is much larger than the\r\nothers. It is this (seen in Fig. 15) which has grown larger and larger\r\nin later descendants of this primitive form and become the elephant's\r\ntusk, whilst all the others have disappeared.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.--Head of the early ancestor of\r\nelephants--Meritherium--as it appeared in life. Observe the absence of\r\na trunk and the enlarged front tooth in the upper jaw, which is\r\nconverted in later members of the elephant-stock or line of descent\r\ninto the great tusk. (After a drawing by Prof. Osborne.)]\r\n\r\nWe now know the complete series of steps connecting elephants with\r\nordinary trunkless, tuskless mammals. The transition from the \"beast\r\nof Meris\" on the one hand to the common typidentate mammalian\r\nancestor, and on the other hand to the elephants, is easy, and\r\nrequires no effort of the imagination. His short muzzle (upper and\r\nlower jaw), first elongated step by step to a considerable length,\r\ngiving us Palæomastodon (Fig. 13). Then the lower jaw shrunk and\r\nbecame shorter than it was at the start, and the rest of the muzzle\r\n(the front part of the upper jaw, carrying with it the nostrils),\r\ndrooped and became the mobile muscular elephant's trunk!\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: I am inclined to think that the line between Pliocene and\r\nPleistocene or Quaternary ought, in this country, to be drawn between\r\nthe White and Red Crag of Suffolk. Glacial conditions set in and were\r\nrecurrent from the commencement of the Red Crag deposit onwards.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Mammals having the number and form of teeth which I have\r\njust described as typical--or such modification of it as can easily be\r\nproduced by suppression of some teeth and enlargement of others--are\r\ncalled Typidentata. On the other hand, the whales, the sloths,\r\nant-eaters, and armadilloes, as also the Marsupials, are called\r\nVariodentata, because we cannot derive their teeth from those of the\r\nTypidentate ancestor. They form lines of descent which separated from\r\nthe other mammals before the Typidentate ancestor of all, except the\r\ngroups just named, was evolved.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nA STRANGE EXTINCT BEAST\r\n\r\n\r\nThe terraces of gravel deposited by existing rivers and the deposits\r\nin caverns in the limestone regions of Western Europe--the so-called\r\n\"Pleistocene\" strata--contain, besides the flint weapons of man and\r\nrare specimens of his bones, the remains of animals which are either\r\nidentical with those living at the present day (though many of them\r\nare not living now in Europe) or of animals very closely similar to\r\nliving species. Thus we find the bones of horses like the wild horse\r\nof Mongolia, of the great bull (the Urus of Cæsar), of the bison, of\r\ndeer and goats, of the Siberian big-nosed antelope, of the musk-ox\r\n(now living within the Arctic circle), of the wild boar, of the\r\nhippopotamus (like that of the Nile), and of lions, hyenas, bears, and\r\nwolves. The most noteworthy of the animals like to, but not identical\r\nwith, any living species are the mammoth, which is very close to the\r\nIndian elephant, but has a hairy coat; the hairy rhinoceros, like, but\r\nnot quite the same as, the African square-mouthed rhinoceros; and the\r\ngreat Irish deer, which is like a giant fallow-deer. These three\r\nanimals are really extinct kinds or species, but are not very far from\r\nliving kinds. In fact, the most recent geological deposits do not\r\ncontain any animals so peculiar, when compared with living animals, as\r\nto necessitate a wide separation of the fossil animal from living\r\n\"congeners\" by the naturalist who classifies animals and tries to\r\nexhibit their degrees of likeness and relationship to one another by\r\nthe names he adopts for them. The mammoth is a distinct \"species\" of\r\nelephant. It requires, it is true, a \"specific\" or \"second\" name of\r\nits own; but it belongs to the genus elephant. Hence we call it\r\n_Elephas primigenius_, whilst the living Indian elephant is _Elephas\r\nIndicus_. The reader is referred to the preceding chapter for further\r\nnotes about elephants.\r\n\r\nThe strata next below the Pleistocene gravels and cave deposits are\r\nascribed to the \"Pliocene age\"--older than these are the \"Miocene\" and\r\nthe \"Eocene,\" and then you come to the Chalk, a good white landmark\r\nseparating newer from older strata.\r\n\r\nWe know now in great detail the skeletons and jaws of some hundreds of\r\nkinds of extinct animals of very different groups found in the Eocene,\r\nthe Miocene, the Pliocene, and the Pleistocene layers of clays, sands,\r\nand gravels of this part of the world. Nothing very strange or unlike\r\nwhat is now living is found in the Pleistocene--the latest\r\ndeposits--but when we go further back strange creatures are\r\ndiscovered, becoming stranger and less like living things as we pass\r\nthrough Pliocene to Miocene, and on--downwards in layers, backwards in\r\ntime--to the Eocene.\r\n\r\nThough the past history of the Mediterranean sea shows that it was\r\nformerly not so extensive as it is now, and that there were junctions\r\nbetween Europe and Africa across its waters, yet the deeper parts of\r\nthat sea are very ancient, and some of the islands have long been\r\nisolated. In Malta the remains of extraordinary species of minute\r\nelephants have been found, one no larger than a small donkey, and in\r\nthe island of Cyprus an English lady, Miss Dorothea Bate, has\r\ndiscovered the bones of a pigmy hippopotamus (like that still living\r\nin Liberia) no larger than a sheep. Miss Bate some three years ago\r\nheard of the existence of a bone-containing deposit of Pleistocene age\r\nin limestone caverns and fissures in the island of Majorca, and with\r\nthe true enthusiasm of an explorer determined to carry on some\r\n\"digging\" there and see what might turn up. In the following spring\r\nshe was there, and obtained a number of bones, jaws, and portions of\r\nskulls, which appeared at first sight to be those of a small goat. Its\r\nsize may be gathered from the fact that its skull is six inches long.\r\nThese and the bones of a few small finches were all that rewarded her\r\npains. The bones of fossil goats (of living species) are found in\r\ncaves at Gibraltar and in Spain; so at first the result seemed\r\ndisappointing. But on carefully clearing out the specimens and\r\nexamining them in London, Miss Bate found that the supposed goat bones\r\nobtained by her in Majorca were really those of a new and most\r\nextraordinary animal, to which (in a paper published in the\r\n\"Geological Magazine\" in September, 1910) she has given the name\r\n\"_Myotragus balearicus_.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.--Side-view of the skull and lower jaw of a\r\ngoat. _inc. i._ The three lower incisor teeth of the left side. _can.\r\ni._ The little canine teeth grouped with them. _p._ The toothless\r\nfront part of the upper jaw. _m. s._ Upper molars or \"grinders.\" _m.\r\ni._ Lower molars or grinders.

In front of the lower jaw the group of three\r\nincisors (_inc. i._) and one canine is seen, whilst the toothless bony\r\nplate (_p._) of the upper jaw, against which they work, is seen in the\r\nright-hand half of the figure. The molars, \"grinders,\" or cheek-teeth\r\nare numbered 1 to 6 in each jaw.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.--Side view of the skull of a typical \"rodent\"\r\nmammal, the Coypu rat (_Myocastor coypus_) from South America. _inc.\r\ns._ Upper incisor. _inc. i._ Lower incisor. _m. s._, _m. i._ Upper and\r\nlower molars, grinders or cheek-teeth.]\r\n\r\nI must ask the reader now to look at the figures here given (Figs. 16\r\nand 17) of the skull and the lower jaw of a goat. The lower jaw might\r\n(except for size) pass for that of a sheep, ox, antelope or deer. They\r\nare all alike. There are on each side six grinding cheek-teeth\r\n(molars), and then as we pass to the front we find a long toothless\r\ngap until we come to the middle line where the two halves of the jaw\r\nunite. There we see a little semicircular group of eight chisel-like\r\nteeth, which work against the toothless pad of the upper jaw opposed\r\nto them, and are the instruments by which these animals, with an\r\nupward jerk of the head, \"crop\" the grass and other herbage on which\r\nthey feed, to be afterwards triturated by the grinding cheek teeth. A\r\nvast series of living and of fossil animals, called the\r\nRuminants--including the giraffes, the antler-bearing forms called\r\ndeer, the cavicorn or sheath-horned bovines, ovines and caprines, and\r\nthe large series of antelopes of Africa and India--all have precisely\r\nthis form of jaw, this number and shape and grouping of the teeth. Now\r\nlet me call to mind the lower jaw of a hare or rabbit or rat (Figs. 18\r\nand 19). There we find on each side the group of grinding cheek-teeth,\r\nwith transverse ridges on their crowns, and a long, toothless gap\r\nbefore we arrive at the front teeth. But the front teeth are only two\r\nin number, one on each side, close to each other, very large, and each\r\nwith a tremendously long, deeply set root. They meet a similar pair of\r\nteeth in the upper jaw, and give the hare, rabbit, rats, mice,\r\nbeavers, and porcupines the power of \"gnawing\" tough substances.\r\nThese animals are hence called Rodents, or gnawers, and the two great\r\nfront teeth are called \"rodent-teeth.\" No two arrangements of teeth\r\ncould be much more unlike than are the group of eight little\r\nchisel-like teeth of the lower jaw of the Ruminants and the two\r\nenormous gnawing teeth of the Rodents. Apparently the two rodent\r\nincisors, or front teeth, of the lower jaw of the rat correspond to\r\nthe two middle incisors of the Ruminant's lower jaw; the other front\r\nteeth of the Ruminant have atrophied, disappeared altogether. The\r\nrodent condition has been developed from that of an ancestor which\r\nhad several front teeth and not two large ones only; but we have not\r\nat present found the intermediate steps.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.--View in the horizontal plane of the teeth of\r\nthe left half of the lower and the left half of the upper jaw of the\r\nCoypu rat to show the single great gnawing incisor on each side, the\r\nfour flat grinding molars and the wide gap between molars and\r\nincisors. Compare with Figs. 17 and 22.]\r\n\r\nThe reader should compare the teeth of the goat and the large rat here\r\npictured with the more typical and complete series of the pig, given\r\nin Fig. 10, p. 84. The pig's teeth are the same in number as those of\r\nthe ancestral primitive typidentate mammal, and their form is near to\r\nthat of the ancestor's teeth.\r\n\r\nNow I come to the extraordinary interest of Miss Bate's goat-like or\r\nantelope-like animal from Majorca. Although it is shown by its skull\r\n(Fig. 20) and other bones to be distinctly one of the sheath-horned\r\nRuminants, very like a small goat or antelope, the lower jaw, of which\r\nthere are several specimens, does not present in front the little\r\ngroup of eight small chisel-like \"cropping\" teeth, but, instead, two\r\nenormous rodent teeth placed side by side, very deeply fixed in the\r\njaw, and quite like those of some rat-like animals in shape. Hence the\r\nname given to this little marvel by Miss Bate--\"Myotragus,\" \"the\r\nrat-goat.\" This strange little animal also differs from goats and\r\nantelopes in having proportionately much thicker and shorter \"feet\"\r\n(cannon-bones) than they have.\r\n\r\nIf the remains of this strange little creature had turned up in more\r\nancient strata--in Pliocene or Miocene--it would have not been quite\r\nso astonishing. But it would be still very remarkable, since it has\r\nall the characters of a goat-like creature in the shape of its skull,\r\nits bony horn-cores, its limb-bones, and its cheek-teeth; and yet, as\r\nit were monstrously and in a most disconcerting way, protrudes from\r\nits lower jaw two great rats' teeth. Nothing like it or approaching it\r\nor suggesting it, is known among recent or fossil Ruminants. They all\r\nwithout exception have a lower jaw with the teeth of the exact number\r\nand grouping which you may see in a sheep's lower jaw. We know\r\nhundreds of them, both living and fossil, many from the Pleistocene,\r\nothers from Pliocene deposits, and even from the still older Miocene,\r\nbut all keep to the one pattern of lower jaw and lower jaw teeth. It\r\nis only in this little island of Majorca, surrounded by very deep\r\nwater and not known to have nurtured any other animal so large in size\r\neither in recent or geologic times, that we come upon a Ruminant with\r\nhorns like a goat's, but with great rat-like front teeth in place of\r\nthe semicircle of eight little cropping toothlets. The wonderful thing\r\nis that the bones found by Miss Bate are light and well preserved,\r\nevidently not very ancient--probably late Pleistocene in age.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.--Drawing of the skull of the rat-toothed goat,\r\nMyotragus--the new extinct beast discovered in limestone fissures in\r\nthe island of Majorca by Miss Bate. 1. Side view of the skull and\r\nlower jaw. 2. Appearance of the two rat-like teeth as seen when the\r\nend of the lower jaw is viewed from above.]\r\n\r\nThe questions that arise are: Where did the rat-goat come from? How\r\ndid this utterly peculiar change in a Ruminant's teeth come about?\r\nWith regard to the second question, it is a matter of importance that\r\nalthough we have hitherto not discovered any Ruminants with this\r\nmodification of the teeth, still less any cavicorn or sheath-horned\r\nRuminant so altered, yet it is by no means rare amongst herbivorous\r\nmammals to find such rat-like teeth making their appearance, whilst\r\nthe smaller side-teeth of the incisor group or front teeth disappear.\r\nThe Australian kangaroos and wombats are a case in point--so is the\r\nlemur-like aye-aye of Madagascar (an insect eater). So is the Hyrax or\r\n\"damian\" of the Cape, and also the very ancient Plagiaulax from the\r\npræ-chalk Purbeck clay. But perhaps the best case for comparison with\r\nthe ruminants is that of the rhinoceroses. There are a great many\r\nspecies and even genera of fossil and recent rhinoceroses. An old\r\nMiocene kind (called Hyracodon) has eight little teeth in the front of\r\nthe lower jaw. In a Pliocene kind of rhinoceros (called _R.\r\nincisivus_) these are reduced to two, the middle two, which are of\r\ngreat size and project far forward--like those of the rat-goat of\r\nMajorca. Among living rhinoceroses the Indian species have these two\r\nfront teeth, but smaller, whilst the square-mouthed African rhinoceros\r\nhas none at all! This helps us, as a parallel, to understand \"the\r\nstrange case\" of Myotragus. But, of course, the rhinoceroses are a\r\ndistinct line of animal descent--remote from Ruminants. They are (like\r\nhorses and tapirs) odd-toed hoofed beasts--not even-toed ones, as are\r\npigs, camels, and ruminants.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn first considering the question of the origin of the rat-goat of\r\nMajorca, some naturalists will, no doubt, be tempted to suggest that\r\nit is a case of a sudden \"sport,\" a \"mutation\" as they now call it,\r\nand not a result of gradual slowly developed reduction of the now lost\r\nteeth and correspondingly gradual enlargement of the two middle ones,\r\ntaking many thousand generations to bring about. The fact that the\r\nrat-goat is found on an island cut off from competition with other\r\nanimals will favour this view. On the other hand, there is the\r\nimportant and really remarkable fact that familiar as man has been for\r\nages with Ruminants of many kinds--such as sheep, goats, cattle,\r\ndeer--there is absolutely no case on record of an \"oddity\" or\r\n\"monstrosity\" resembling the rat-goat's condition occurring in the\r\nteeth of any of the hundreds of thousands of these animals killed and\r\neaten by man, and therefore closely examined. Professor Bateson, who\r\na few years ago ransacked the museums of Europe for instances of\r\n\"discontinuous variation,\" or \"sports,\" and wrote a valuable book on\r\nthe subject, did not discover any example of the kind. Apart from the\r\nview, which is very generally held, that such sudden \"mutations\" as\r\n\"rat-teeth in a ruminant\" are--even should they occur--not\r\nperpetuated, we are not really in any way driven to suppose that the\r\nrat-goat of Majorca originated in that island. It is true that we know\r\nnothing like it in the Pliocene and Miocene of the Mediterranean\r\nregion which could have been its immediate ancestor. But probably the\r\nancestors of the rat-goat were slowly developed from a Miocene\r\nsheath-horned ruminant, a primitive sort of antelope in some part of\r\nNorth-west Africa, or in an extension of it now submerged in the\r\nAtlantic, and stragglers of this curious and now lost Ruminant stock\r\nwere left in Majorca when in Miocene or early Pliocene times that\r\nisland became detached from its Hispano-African connection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nVEGETARIANS AND THEIR TEETH\r\n\r\n\r\nNo mistake, said Huxley, is more frequently made by clever people than\r\nthat of supposing that a cause or an opinion is unsound because the\r\narguments put forward in its favour by its advocates are foolish or\r\nerroneous. Some of the arguments put forward in favour of the\r\nexclusive use by mankind of a vegetable diet can be shown to be based\r\non misconception and error, and I propose now to mention one or two of\r\nthese. But I wish to guard against the supposition that I am convinced\r\nin consequence that animal substances form the best possible diet for\r\nman, or that an exclusively vegetable diet may not, if properly\r\nselected, be advantageous for a large majority of mankind. That\r\nquestion, as well as the question of the advantage of a mixed diet of\r\nanimal and vegetable substances, and the best proportion and quantity\r\nof the substances so mixed, must be settled, as also the question as\r\nto the harm or good in the habitual use of small quantities of\r\nalcohol, by definite careful experiment by competent physiologists,\r\nconducted on a scale large enough to give conclusive results. The\r\ncogency of the arguments in favour of vegetarianism which I am about\r\nto discuss is another matter.\r\n\r\nIn the first place it is very generally asserted by those who advocate\r\na purely vegetable diet that man's teeth are of the shape and pattern\r\nwhich we find in fruit-eating or in root-eating animals allied to him.\r\nThis is true. The warm-blooded hairy quadrupeds which suckle their\r\nyoung and are called \"mammals\" (for which word perhaps \"beasts\" is the\r\nnearest Anglo-Saxon equivalent) show in different groups and orders a\r\ngreat variety in their teeth. The birds of to-day have no teeth, the\r\nreptiles, amphibians, and fishes have usually simple conical or\r\npeg-like teeth, which are used simply for holding and tearing. In some\r\ncases the pointed pin-like teeth are broadened out so as to be\r\nbutton-like, and act as crushing organs for breaking up shell-fish.\r\nThe mammals alone have a great variety and elaboration of the teeth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.--Side view of the skull of a clouded tiger\r\n(_Felis nebulosa_) to show the teeth. _inc. s._ The three incisors.\r\n_can. s._ Upper canine, corner-tooth, or dog-tooth. _can. i._ Lower\r\ncanine. _m. s._ The four upper molars or cheek-teeth (called\r\n\"grinders\" in herbivorous animals). _m. i._ The three lower molars or\r\ncheek-teeth.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.--View in the horizontal plane of the teeth of\r\nthe lower and upper jaw of the same clouded tiger's skull. _inc. i._\r\nLower incisors. _inc. s._ Upper incisors. _can. i._ and _can. s._\r\nLower and upper canine. _m._ The cheek-teeth--three only in the lower\r\njaw, a minute fourth molar present in the upper.]\r\n\r\nIn shape and size, as well as in number, the teeth of mammals are very\r\nclearly related to the nature of their food in the first place, and\r\nsecondly to their use as weapons of attack or of defence. When the\r\nsurface of the cheek-teeth is broad, with low and numerous tubercles,\r\nthe food of the animal is of a rather soft substance, which yields to\r\na grinding action. Such substances are fruits, nuts, roots, or leaves,\r\nwhich are \"triturated\" and mixed with the saliva during the process\r\nof mastication. Where the vegetable food is coarse grass or tree\r\ntwigs, requiring long and thorough grinding, transverse ridges of\r\nenamel are present on the cheek-teeth, as in elephants, cattle, deer,\r\nand rabbits (see Figs. 8, 17, 19). Truly carnivorous animals, which\r\neat the raw carcases of other animals, have a different shape of\r\nteeth. Not only do they have large and dagger-like canines or\r\n\"dog-teeth\" as weapons of attack, but the cheek-teeth (very few in\r\nnumber) present a long, sharp-edged ridge running parallel to the\r\nlength of the jaw, the edges of which in corresponding upper and lower\r\nteeth fit and work together like the blades of a pair of scissors. The\r\ncats (including the lions, tigers and leopards) have this arrangement\r\nin perfection (see Figs. 21 and 22). They cut the bones and muscles of\r\ntheir prey into great lumps with the scissor-like cheek-teeth, and\r\nswallow great pieces whole without mastication. Insect-eating mammals\r\nhave cheek-teeth with three or four sharp-pointed tubercles standing\r\nup on the surface. They break the hard-shelled insects and swallow\r\nthem rapidly. The fish-eating whales have an immense number of\r\npeg-like pointed teeth only. These serve as do those of the\r\nseals--merely to catch and grip the fish, which are swallowed whole.\r\n\r\nIt is quite clear that man's cheek-teeth do not enable him to cut\r\nlumps of meat and bone from raw carcases and swallow them whole, nor\r\nto grip live fish and swallow them straight off (Pl. VI). They are\r\nbroad, square-surfaced teeth, with four or fewer low rounded tubercles\r\nfitted to crush soft food, as are those of monkeys (see Pl. VII and\r\nits description). And there can be no doubt that man fed originally,\r\nlike monkeys, on easily crushed fruits, nuts, and roots. He could not\r\neat like a cat.\r\n\r\nA fundamental mistake has arisen amongst some of the advocates of\r\nvegetarianism by the use of the words \"carnivorous\" and \"flesh-eating\"\r\nin an ill-defined way. Man has never eaten lumps of raw meat and bone,\r\nand no one proposes that he should do so to-day. Man did not take to\r\nmeat-eating until he had acquired the use of fire, and had learnt to\r\ncook the meat before he ate it. He thus separated the bone and\r\nintractable sinew from the flesh, which he rendered friable and\r\ndivisible by thorough grilling, roasting, or baking. To eat meat thus\r\naltered, both chemically and in texture, is a very different thing\r\nfrom eating the raw carcases of large animals. Man's teeth are\r\nthoroughly fitted for the trituration of cooked meat, which is,\r\nindeed, as well suited to their mechanical action as are fruits, nuts,\r\nand roots. Hence we see that the objection to a meat diet based on the\r\nstructure of man's teeth does not apply to the use of cooked meat as\r\ndiet. The use by man of uncooked meat is not proposed or defended.\r\n\r\nYet, further, it is well to take notice of the fact that there are\r\nmany vegetarian wild animals which do not hesitate to eat certain soft\r\nanimals or animal products when they get the chance. Thus, both\r\nmonkeys and primitive men will eat grubs and small soft animals, and\r\nalso the eggs of birds. Whilst the cat tribe, in regard to the\r\nchemical action of their digestive juices, are so specialised for\r\neating raw meat that it is practically impossible for them to take\r\nvegetable matter as even a small portion of their diet, and whilst, on\r\nthe other hand, the grass-eating cattle, sheep, goats, antelopes, deer\r\nand giraffes are similarly disqualified from any form of meat-diet,\r\nmost other land-mammals can be induced, without harm to themselves, to\r\ntake a mixed diet, even in those cases where they do not naturally\r\nseek it. Pigs, on the one hand, and bears, on the other, tend\r\nnaturally to a mixed diet. Many birds, under conditions adverse to the\r\nfinding of their usual food, will change from vegetable to animal\r\ndiet, or _vice-versâ_. Sea-gulls normally are fish-eaters, but some\r\nwill eat biscuit and grain when fish cannot be had. Pigeons have been\r\nfed successfully on a meat diet; so, too, some parrots, and also the\r\nfamiliar barn-door fowl. Many of our smaller birds eat both insects\r\nand grain, according to opportunity. Hence it appears impossible to\r\nbase any argument against the use of cooked meat as part of man's diet\r\nupon the structure of his teeth, or upon any far-reaching law of\r\nNature which decrees that every animal is absolutely either fitted\r\n(internally and chemically, as well as in the matter of teeth) for a\r\ndiet consisting exclusively of vegetable substances, or else is\r\nimmutably assigned to one consisting exclusively of animal substances.\r\nThere is no _à priori_ assumption possible against the use as food by\r\nman of nutritious matter derived from animals' bodies properly\r\nprepared.\r\n\r\nSo far as _à priori_ argument has any value in such a matter, it\r\nsuggests that the most perfect food for any animal--that which\r\nsupplies exactly the constituents needed by the animal in exactly\r\nright quantity and smallest bulk--is the flesh and blood of another\r\nanimal of its own species. This is a startling theoretical\r\njustification--from the purely dietetic point of view--of\r\ncannibalism. It is, however, of no conclusive value; the only method\r\nwhich can give us conclusions of any real value in this and similarly\r\ncomplex matters is prolonged, full, well-devised, well-recorded\r\nexperiment. At the same time, we may just note that the favourite food\r\nof the scorpion is the juice of the body of another scorpion, and that\r\nthe same preference for cannibalism exists in spiders, many insects,\r\nfishes, and even higher animals.\r\n\r\nAnother line of argument by which some advocates of vegetarianism\r\nappeal to the popular judgment is by representing flesh-food derived\r\nfrom animals as something dirty, foul, and revolting, full of microbic\r\ngerms, whilst vegetable products are extolled as being clean and\r\nsweet--free from odour and putrescence and from the scaremonger's\r\nmicrobes. This, I perhaps need hardly say, is a gigantic illusion and\r\nmisrepresentation. I came across it the other day in a very\r\nunreasonable pamphlet on food by the American writer, Mr. Upton\r\nSinclair. Putrefactive microbes attack vegetable foods and produce\r\nrevolting smells and poisons in them, just as they do in foods of\r\nanimal origin. It is true that on the whole more varieties of\r\nvegetable food can be kept dry and ready for use by softening with hot\r\nwater than is the case with foods prepared from animals. This is only\r\na question of not keeping food too long or in conditions tending to\r\nthe access of putrefactive bacteria. It is, on the whole, more usual\r\nand necessary, in order to render it palatable, to apply heat to\r\nflesh, fish, and fowl than to fruits. And it is by heat--heat of the\r\ntemperature of boiling water--applied for ten minutes or more, that\r\npoison-producing and infective bacteria are killed and rendered\r\nharmless. More people have become infected by deadly parasites and\r\nhave died from cholera and similar diseases, through having taken the\r\ngerms of those diseases into their stomachs with raw and over-ripe\r\nfruit or uncooked vegetables and the manured products of the kitchen\r\ngarden, than have suffered from the presence of disease-germs or\r\nputrefactive bacteria in well-cooked meat. Here, in fact, \"cooking\"\r\nmakes all the difference, just as it does in the matter we were\r\ndiscussing above of the fitness of flesh and bone for trituration by\r\nman's teeth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate VI.--The series of teeth in the upper (1) and\r\nlower jaw (2) of a modern European (natural size). The teeth are\r\nplaced closely side by side without a gap--an arrangement which does\r\nnot occur in the apes nor in any other living mammal, although it is\r\nfound in some extinct herbivores--the Anoplotherium and the\r\nArsinöitherium. The shape of the arch formed by the row of teeth\r\nshould be compared with that shown by the same arch in the Gibbon (Pl.\r\nVII). The crowns of the teeth are very carefully drawn in this figure,\r\nwhich is from a plate published by Professor Selenka.\r\n\r\nIt must be noted that the number of tubercles on the true molars may\r\nbe in exceptional cases one more or one less than that given in this\r\ndrawing which gives the most usual number. The word \"molar\" is often\r\nused to include the five cheek-teeth on each side of each jaw, but\r\nmore strictly the anterior bicuspid teeth are called \"pre-molars,\" and\r\nthe three larger teeth behind them, which have no predecessors or\r\nrepresentatives in the first or milk dentition, are called true molars\r\nor simply \"molars\"--a rule we have followed here.\r\n\r\nIn both upper and lower jaw we see the four incisors in the middle\r\n(Inc. 1, Inc. 2); on each side of them is the conical crown of a\r\ncanine--a tooth which is greatly enlarged in the ape (see Pl. VII),\r\nbut is no larger proportionately than it is here even in the most\r\nancient known human jaw, that from the Pleistocene of Heidelberg (see\r\n\"Science from an Easy Chair,\" Methuen, 1910, p. 405). The two small\r\nbicuspid \"pre-molars\" and the three large molars follow these on each\r\nside in each jaw. The crown of the most anterior (or \"first\") molar of\r\nthe upper jaw has four cusps, tubercles, or cones on it. It is\r\n\"quadri-tuberculate.\" The second and third molars of the upper jaw\r\nhave three such prominent tubercles (excluding a row of small\r\ntubercles on the hinder margin of the second); they are, in fact,\r\ntri-tuberculate; whilst the two hindermost molars of the lower jaw\r\nhave four tubercles and are called quadri-tuberculate. The first molar\r\n(M1) of the lower jaw has in this specimen five tubercles. In 60 per\r\ncent. of European lower jaws this is the case. But in 40 per cent.\r\nthis tooth is quadri-tuberculate. In Polynesians, Chinese, Melanesians\r\nand negroes five tubercles are found on this tooth in 90 per cent. of\r\nthe jaws examined. The apes are characterised by five tubercles on\r\nthis tooth, and they are found also on the first lower molars of\r\nprehistoric men. Four tubercles only on this tooth is a departure from\r\nthe ape's condition and is found more frequently in Europeans.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that these big molar teeth, as well as the two smaller\r\nones in front of them on each side of each jaw, are adapted for\r\nbreaking up rather soft, pulpy food, and not for cutting lumps of bone\r\nor raw flesh, as are the molars of the clouded tiger (identical with\r\nthose of all species of the genus _Felis_), shown in Figs. 21 and 22,\r\npp. 103, 104, nor for rubbing grain, grass or herbage to a paste, as\r\nare those of the goat (Fig. 17), those of the Coypu rat (Fig. 19), and\r\nthose of the elephants and mastodons (Fig. 8).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate VII.--Drawings of (1) the upper and (2) the lower\r\nseries of teeth of the Gibbon (_Hylobates concolor_), one of the\r\nanthropoid or most man-like apes (enlarged by one third). If these\r\ndrawings are compared with those in Pl. VI, showing man's teeth, the\r\nmost striking difference seen is that the \"arch\" or series of teeth is\r\nhere elongated and squared, not rounded in front, whilst there is\r\nplenty of room in both jaws for the last or wisdom tooth, which is not\r\nthe case in modern races of men, though in the ancient Neander man's\r\njaw and in that from Heidelberg there is ample space for the last\r\nmolar as in the apes. The next most important difference is that in\r\nthe gibbon the four canine teeth are very large and tusk-like, and\r\nmust certainly be of value as weapons of attack--which man's are not.\r\nConnected with the large size of the canines is the presence of a gap\r\n(or \"diastema\" as it is called) between the four front teeth or\r\nincisors of the upper jaw and the upper canine--which allows the lower\r\ncanine to fit in front of the upper canine when the jaw is closed. The\r\nnumber of the tubercles or cones on the molars (the two smaller\r\npre-molars and the three hinder large molars) can be compared in\r\ndetail in these beautiful drawings from Professor Selenka's work,\r\nwhich are the most careful and perfect which have ever been published.\r\nThe agreement of these teeth in man and the gibbon is very close: but\r\nthere are differences. The first, or most anterior pre-molar of the\r\nlower jaw has one predominant cusp or cone; the second, like both in\r\nthe upper jaw, is \"bicuspid,\" or bi-tuberculate, as in man. The three\r\nbig molars of the upper jaw are closely similar to those of man, with\r\nsome small differences, the second being quadri-tuberculate, whilst in\r\nman it is as often tri-tuberculate (as it is in Pl. VI) as it is\r\nquadri-tuberculate. But the two anterior big molars of the lower jaw\r\nare seen to have each five well-marked cones, cusps or tubercles; they\r\nare quinqui-tuberculate, whilst in man the first lower molar is often\r\nquadri-tuberculate and the second even more frequently so. The last\r\nlower molar (wisdom tooth) of the gibbon is like that of man,\r\nquadri-tuberculate.\r\n\r\nThe details of the tubercles on these molar teeth distinctly justify\r\nthe conclusion that they are adapted in the two animals\r\ncompared--namely, man and the gibbon--to food of the same mechanical\r\nquality, and this undoubtedly is fruit and nuts. Nevertheless such a\r\nform of tooth is equally well adapted to the texture of cooked meat,\r\nwhich has served many races of man for probably hundreds of thousands\r\nof years as food.]\r\n\r\nOnce we remember that man is not fitted for the \"raw meat\" diet of the\r\ncarnivora, but is fitted for the \"cooked meat\" diet which he has\r\nhimself discovered--alone of all animals--we shall get rid of a\r\nmisleading prejudice in the consideration of the question as to\r\nwhether civilised men should or should not make cooked meat a portion\r\nof their diet, with the purpose of maintaining themselves in as\r\nhealthy and vigorous a state as possible. Do not let us forget that\r\nancient Palæolithic cave-men certainly made use of fire to cook their\r\nmeals of animal flesh, and that probably this use of fire dates back\r\nto a still earlier period when, in consequence of this application of\r\nthe red, running tongues of flame, which he had learned to produce,\r\nprimitive man was able to leave the warmer climates of the earth and\r\ntheir abundant fruits, and to establish himself in temperate and even\r\nsub-Arctic regions.\r\n\r\nExperiments on a large and decisive scale in regard to the value of\r\nthe different foods taken by man and the question of the desirability\r\nof cooked meat as part of his diet have never been carried out, nor\r\nhas the use of alcohol been studied by direct experimental method on a\r\nlarge scale. Inasmuch as the feeding of our Army and Navy, of\r\nprisoners, lunatics, and paupers, is the business of the State, it is\r\nobviously the duty of the Government to investigate this matter and\r\narrive at a decision. It can be done by the Government, and only by\r\nthe Government. The Army Medical Department is fully capable, and, I\r\nam told, desirous, of undertaking this investigation. Five hundred\r\nsoldiers in barracks would find it no hardship, but an agreeable duty\r\n(if rewarded in a suitable way), to submit to various diets, and to\r\ncomparative tests of the value of such diets. There would be no\r\ndifficulty in arranging the experimental investigation. Fifty years\r\nago similar work (but not precisely in regard to the questions now\r\nraised) was done by the Army Medical Department, under Parkes, with\r\nmost valuable and widely recognised results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nFOOD AND COOKERY\r\n\r\n\r\nAnimals, taking one kind with another, nourish themselves on an\r\nimmense variety of food. The flesh and the blood of other animals of\r\nall kinds, warm or cold, the leaves, twigs, fruits, juices of plants,\r\nputrid carcases, hair, feathers, skin, bran, sawdust, the vegetable\r\nmould or \"humus\" of the earth's surface, the sand of the sea, with its\r\nminute particles of organic detritus, all serve as food to different\r\nkinds of animals. Some are very little fettered in their tastes, and\r\nare called \"omnivorous,\" others are bound in the strictest way to a\r\ndiet consisting of the leaves of some one species of plant or the\r\njuices of one species of animal. Some of the latter class, under\r\nstress or privation, can accommodate themselves to a new food very\r\ndifferent in character and origin from that which is habitual to them;\r\nothers have no elasticity in this respect, and must have their exact\r\nhabitual food-plant or food-animal, unless they are to die of\r\nstarvation.\r\n\r\nMan exhibits his great powers of accommodation to changed\r\ncircumstances in respect of food as well as in other matters. If we\r\nare to suppose, as is probable, that our original ape-like ancestors\r\nfed exclusively upon fruits and an occasional egg or juicy grub, how\r\nvast are the changes in diet to which man has habituated himself! Man\r\nis sometimes said to be omnivorous, but this is not a sufficient\r\ndescription of the state of things which has grown up as he has spread\r\nover the earth's surface. Every race--and even many a small group of\r\nmen--has its accustomed diet, to depart from which is a pain and a\r\ndifficulty, even though new kinds of food may be gradually accepted\r\nand even become popular. Man has in this, as in so many other things,\r\na large range of possible accommodation, but he has at the same time\r\nhabits the continuance of which are necessary for the healthy working\r\nof the nervous system. The psychical element in the matter of\r\nfood-habit is important in all higher animals, but most of all in man.\r\nThe digestive organs are controlled by the nervous system, and the\r\nbrain acts upon the latter in such a way as to favour or to restrain\r\nthe \"appetite\" and the secretion of the elaborate digestive juices, so\r\nthat fear, surprise, disgust, and \"nausea\" (that strange product of\r\nmental and physical reactions) may destroy appetite and inhibit the\r\ndigestive process. There are vast populations of men who live on rice,\r\nor beans, or meal, and never eat animal food, not even milk (after\r\nbabyhood), nor cheese, and would be, at a first attempt to eat it,\r\n\"put off\" and disgusted by a mutton chop. There are others who subsist\r\nalmost entirely on fish, others who live on dried beef, others who\r\nlive on the fat of whales and seals, and would be for a generation or\r\ntwo injured, half starved, and some of them even killed, by a change\r\nof diet. Again, there are others who consider that they must have and\r\nwill be \"ill\" unless they had the cooked flesh of an ox or sheep as\r\npart of their daily food. Let us examine this latter group a little\r\nmore fully--a group to which the nations of Europe belong, with the\r\nexception of the Italians, who are essentially a meal-, fruit-, and\r\ncheese-eating people.\r\n\r\nApparently at a very early time, even before the last glacial period,\r\nman had learnt the use of fire, and roasted or grilled the carcases of\r\nother animals which he killed in the chase, in order to consume them\r\nas food. We have no reason to suppose that man ever made use of the\r\nraw flesh of higher animals as his habitual diet. His teeth are not,\r\nand never were, from his earliest ape-like days, adapted to true\r\ncarnivorous diet. Cooked meat is not the food of a carnivor, but is an\r\nadaptation of the flesh of animals to the requirements of a\r\nfrugivorous animal. Probably the use of grain and cultivated vegetable\r\nfood is a later step in human progress than the roasting of meat. The\r\nNeandermen, and even the later Reindeer-men (Cromagnards), had no\r\ncultivated fields, but lived on roasted meat (of beasts, birds, and\r\nfish) and wild fruits. We know how thoroughly the most ancient Greeks\r\nenjoyed the long slices of roasted meat cut from the chine, as told in\r\nthe Homeric poems, and everywhere in Europe after the neolithic or\r\npolished-stone period, meat was a main article of diet, in conjunction\r\nwith the vegetable products of agriculture. In this country, after the\r\nNorman conquest, meat-eating was greatly favoured by the important\r\nindustry which grew up in hides. The land was well suited for the\r\npasturage of cattle, and owing to the smallness of the population and\r\nthe abundance of cattle slaughtered for their hides, meat was almost\r\nto be had for the asking. It was thus that Englishmen became great\r\nmeat-eaters and that \"the roast beef of Old England\" was established.\r\nLater the same superfluity of meat--in this case, \"mutton\"--recurred\r\nand became general when wool-growing and the manufacture of woollen\r\ngoods developed into important industries. Relatively to the\r\npopulation there was more \"meat\" of oxen and sheep in this country\r\nthan on the continent of Europe, and this disproportion has been\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\nBut the increase of population has led to a considerable change in the\r\ndiet of a very large proportion--the poorer part--of the community.\r\nWhilst the families of the better-paid working class and all the\r\nmiddle and upper class continue to eat meat, the agricultural labourer\r\nand the poorer workmen in towns live chiefly on flour, sugar, bacon,\r\nand cheese. Probably they have become habituated to this diet, and,\r\nprovided that the quantity is sufficient, it cannot be maintained that\r\nthe diet, in which meat is nearly or altogether absent, is unhealthy.\r\nMany vigorous and muscularly well-developed populations in other lands\r\nthrive on exclusively vegetable food.\r\n\r\nA curious and not altogether comforting reflection is that if the\r\ninexpensive and simple food of the agricultural labourer is\r\nsufficient, the section of the community which spends from five to ten\r\nshillings per head a day on a mixed diet of meat, fish, eggs, and\r\nvegetables is guilty of waste and excess. Here, however, the\r\nremarkable, and, in fact, exceptional domination of \"habit\" (in the\r\ncase of man), in regard to both the actual articles of food and the\r\nmode of its preparation, has to be recognised. Such and such\r\ninexpensive and unskilfully prepared food may contain more than the\r\nnecessary amount of proteids (that is, matters like flesh, the casein\r\nof cheese and of vegetables, and the albumen of eggs), of\r\nhydro-carbons (_i.e._, fats), of carbo-hydrates (_i.e._, starch and\r\nsugar), yet if you were suddenly to compel a man accustomed to\r\nwell-cooked meat to live on such food he would be unable to assimilate\r\nit, his digestive organs would refuse to work, and he would become, if\r\nnot seriously ill, yet so ill-nourished and sickly that he would be\r\nunfit for his work and readily fall a victim to disease. It is, in\r\nfact, impossible to lay down any scheme of diet based on the mere\r\nprovision of the necessary quantities of food materials whilst\r\nignoring the formed habits of the individual and the relation of the\r\npsychical conditions which we call \"taste,\" \"appetite,\" \"fancy,\"\r\n\"disgust,\" to the actual processes of digestion and the consequent\r\nefficiency of the proposed diet.\r\n\r\nNo doubt gradually, after a few generations, a whole people may become\r\nhealthily habituated to a diet which would have been positively\r\ninjurious to their forebears, and no doubt individuals may be led by\r\nfortitude or by necessity in time (perhaps weeks, perhaps years) to\r\nacquire a tolerance, or even enjoyment, of food at first repulsive,\r\nand therefore injurious. The difficulty in the matter is not that of\r\ncorrectly determining what is physiologically sufficient for the human\r\nanimal, nor even what would be a healthy diet for a community when\r\nonce, after a transition period of distress and injury, habituated or\r\n\"attuned\" to that diet. The difficulty is to arrive at a conclusion as\r\nto what is really the suitable and reasonable diet for an\r\nindividual--yourself or one like yourself--having regard to the\r\nlifelong habits of the individual, and the consequent nervous\r\nreactions established in him or her in relation to the taste, quality,\r\nand mode of presentation of food. Robust people, so long as they get\r\nwhat suits their own uncultivated taste, are apt to make very light of\r\nwhat they call \"fancies\" about food, and to overlook their real\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nFeeding on the part of civilised man is not the simple procedure which\r\nit is with animals, although many animals are particular as to their\r\nfood and what is called \"dainty.\" The necessity for civilised man of\r\ncheerful company at his meal, and for the absence of mental anxiety,\r\nis universally recognised, as well as the importance of an inviting\r\nappeal to the appetite through the sense of smell and of sight, whilst\r\nthe injurious effect of the reverse conditions, which may lead to\r\nnausea, and even vomiting, is admitted. Even the ceremonial features\r\nof the dinner table, the change of clothes before sitting down to the\r\nrepast, the leisurely yet precise succession of approved and expected\r\ndishes, accompanied by pleasant talk and light-hearted companionship,\r\nare shown by strict scientific examination to be important aids to the\r\nhealthy digestion of food, which need not be large in quantity,\r\nalthough it should be wisely presented.\r\n\r\nThese psychical conditions of healthy feeding are not trivial matters,\r\nas we are too apt to suppose. They are part, and a very important\r\npart, of the physiology of nutrition, and so deserving of scientific\r\ninquiry and of practical attention. They have been made the subject of\r\ncareful experiment by a Russian physiologist, Pavloff. At a recent\r\nmeeting of the British Association this matter was brought under\r\ndiscussion in the Physiological Section, and it was pointed out by the\r\nauthor of a very interesting communication that the whole question as\r\nto what is and what is not a sound and healthy diet is too often dealt\r\nwith by writers who ignore the psychical (or shall we say the\r\ncerebral?) factor. Cases were cited of dangerous arrest of the power\r\nof digesting, or even of swallowing, food which were cured by giving\r\nthe patient some apparently inappropriate and probably harmful article\r\nof food for which he or she had a fancy, such as a grilled\r\nsalmon-steak, the last thing which would be spontaneously recommended\r\nby a medical man to a patient who had been suffering for weeks from\r\ninability to take food. The willingness is all--the assent, the\r\napproval of the cerebral centres, and the consequent unlocking of the\r\nwhole arrested mechanism of digestive secretions and movements. Such a\r\ncase is only an extreme instance. But it is undoubtedly the fact that\r\njust as the sight of so small a thing as a drop of blood, or even the\r\nword \"blood,\" will on occasion cause a strong, healthy man to faint,\r\nso quite a small excess or defect in the accustomed quality of food\r\nwill at times arrest the appetite and digestive processes of a healthy\r\nman. To many a healthy individual one among many flavours and savours\r\nassociated with agreeable food is necessary in order that healthy\r\nappetite and proper digestion may be set going, and the absence of the\r\nright flavour and the presence of what is, in his experience, a wrong\r\nand disgusting smell or taste in the food set before him, will produce\r\nnausea and complete arrest of the digestive processes.\r\n\r\nIt is apparently owing to this cause that \"tinned meats\" have proved\r\nto be of little value as rations for an army in campaign, for\r\nexploring expeditions, and for remote mining camps. It is not that\r\nsuch tinned meats do not contain the necessary constituents of food,\r\nor that they contain poisonous substances, but that they produce a\r\nsense of disgust, and arrest the digestive processes. Soldiers,\r\ntravellers, and miners have assured me that they prefer a dry biscuit\r\nand dried, or salted, or sugared meat, to the supposed more \"tasty\"\r\ntinned meats, and that such is the general experience of their\r\ncomrades.\r\n\r\nOf similar nature is another very serious trouble, in regard to the\r\nhealthy feeding of the modern Englishman, which has come upon us in\r\nconsequence of the quite modern system of huge restaurants, whether in\r\nLondon or in the very large hotels, which are now run in Swiss,\r\nItalian and English summer resorts. Hundreds of visitors are \"catered\r\nfor\" daily. There is no attempt at anything which deserves the name of\r\ncookery. Great monopolists control the supplies, and contract to\r\ndeliver to these hotels, even in out-of-the-way localities, so much\r\nice-stored, \"mousey\" fish, \"mousey\" quails, stringy meat, impossible\r\nvegetables and fruits, gathered from the cheapest markets of Europe\r\nand of a quality just not bad enough to cause a revolt among the hotel\r\nvisitors. The heating of the food is done by patent machinery in ovens\r\nand by the use of boiling fat. No cook is in these circumstances\r\npossible, with his artistic feeling for the production of a perfect\r\nresult of skill and taste. A kind of bottled meat-flavoured sauce,\r\nmanufactured from spent yeast, is used to make the soups, and is\r\npoured, with an equally nauseating result, over the hard veal, the\r\ntough chicken, the \"mousey\" quails, and the tasteless beef and mutton,\r\nwhich are never roasted, but are baked or stewed in boiling\r\nfat--though shamelessly described as \"rôtis\" in the pretentious and\r\nmendacious \"menu\" placed on the dinner-table. The consequence is that\r\nthe tourist, who has been overfed at home, eats very little, and his\r\nhealth benefits. But in such an hotel the man who lives carefully when\r\nat home, and desires a simple but properly cooked meal, is reduced to\r\na state of indigestion, semi-starvation and misery.\r\n\r\nThe Englishman who is disgusted by the new mechanical methods of\r\ncookery in the great hotels of Continental \"resorts,\" returns to\r\nLondon, and finds the same atrocious system at work--not only in the\r\npublic restaurants, but in his club. Nowhere in London can you rely on\r\nbeing served with really fresh fish, however highly you may pay for\r\nit. Rarely it is fresh, usually it is not. The ice storage people take\r\ngood care that you shall not obtain fresh fish, and so retain your\r\ntaste for it. Nowhere at club or restaurant, with rare exceptions, can\r\nyou obtain meat roasted in the old-fashioned way on a roasting-jack,\r\ncarefully \"basted\" during the process, and served when exactly cooked\r\nto a turn. There were, only a few years ago, one or two such places\r\nsurviving--both clubs and restaurants--where proper roasting was done,\r\nbut, like the rest, they have now adopted lazy, economical,\r\nmoney-saving methods. Their managers calculate that what they do will\r\nserve. It is good enough for the crowd! So at last you abandon the\r\nefforts to obtain decent simple food, in club or hotel, and dine with\r\nyour friend _en famille_. The same thing confronts you. The joint has\r\nbeen baked in an oven, of which it smells, and is surrounded by a\r\nsickly gravy, produced by pouring hot water over it! In conversation\r\nwith your hostess, you find that she knows nothing whatever about the\r\nsimplest elements of the preparation of food. She tells you she avoids\r\nroasting because it necessitates a large fire and an extra expenditure\r\nof £5 a year on coal, and she also purchases those mouldy,\r\nfrost-bitten potatoes instead of the best, because they cost half as\r\nmuch as sound ones--and she herself does not care for potatoes. They\r\nare fattening!\r\n\r\nSometimes at a restaurant or club, served by a foreign \"chef,\" a\r\nYorkshire pudding, as hard as a stale loaf of bread, is handed round\r\nin slabs with the so-called \"roast\" beef. It is not roasted: it is\r\nbaked beef, and the pudding is an ill-tasting baked mess, also.\r\nNowhere in London in public or private house do I ever see the\r\nproperly cooked article. True Yorkshire pudding can only be made by\r\nplacing it under the roasting joint, which drips digestion-promoting\r\nessences into the pudding whilst itself rotating, hissing and\r\nspluttering--as did the joints roasted in the caves long ago by the\r\nprehistoric Reindeer-men. The scientific importance of good roasting\r\nand grilling is that a savour is thereby produced which sets the whole\r\ngastric and digestive economy of the man who sniffs it and tastes it,\r\nat work. Possibly our successors, a generation or two hence, will have\r\nlearnt to do without this, and will have acquired as intimate and\r\nhappy a gastronomic relation to what now are for us the nauseous\r\nflavours of superheated fat (rarely renewed), and of the all-pervading\r\ngravy fabricated by chemical treatment of yeast, as that which we\r\nourselves have acquired in regard to the old-established and\r\npainstaking cookery of the early Victorian and many preceding ages.\r\n\r\nMedical men who are occupied as specialists with the study of very\r\nyoung children have clearly demonstrated that the implanting of\r\ntastes, tendencies and habits in infants of from two to eight years of\r\nage has an immense importance in their subsequent development.\r\nCharacter and capacity are really formed in those early years. Food\r\npreferences, no less than mental and moral qualities, are then\r\ncreated. Yet the children of both rich and poor are in these early\r\nstages either left to haphazard or entrusted to ignorant nursemaids.\r\nFor those of us who were not born to the present system the transition\r\nto the new methods of wholesale cookery is an abomination, and to\r\nescape from them a matter of difficulty. We have to secure an ancient\r\nroasting-jack and a large clear fire in our own kitchen, and to\r\ninstruct our cook--since no woman has taught her what she ought to\r\nknow--in the art of roasting and grilling, in the preparation of\r\nYorkshire pudding, in the mystery of the marrow-bone and the proper\r\nand distinct use of garlic, onions, shalots, chives, chervil,\r\ntarragon, marjoram, basil, other herbs, and divers peppers, and\r\nfinally to train her in the supreme accomplishment of the seasoning of\r\na salad.\r\n\r\nMaybe that the present established relations of our appetites to the\r\ntime-honoured savours, by which the ancient Jews sought to propitiate\r\nthe Deity, are destined to be superseded. On the other hand it is\r\nquite possible that all the juggling of modern \"machine\" cookery is a\r\nfalse step, and injurious to digestion and health. It is not unlikely\r\nthat there is no relish which has so sure a hold on the digestion of\r\nEuropean man, no appeal to the cerebral mechanism controlling the\r\nliberation of his gastric juices, which is so infallible as that\r\nemanating from \"well and truly\" roasted or grilled meat.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to account for the present neglect of decent cookery\r\nand the triumph of the sham French cookery (for it is not French at\r\nall!) which is at present foisted on a long-suffering public. Probably\r\nthe enormously increased number of visitors to foreign resorts and of\r\nfrequenters of restaurants in London have led to huge enterprise in\r\n\"catering,\" and to a monopoly which has driven out of existence the\r\nsmaller establishments, where alone the artist-cook can flourish. But\r\nit seems that the neglect of decent cooking is also due in this\r\ncountry to a racial incapacity and indifference which leads both men\r\nand women to despise \"taking pains\" about small things, and brings\r\nthem into the world devoid of the desire to carry out with skill those\r\nsmall enterprises on which much of the sweetness and gaiety of life\r\ndepends.\r\n\r\nEven in the time of Charles II the skill and seriousness of French\r\ncookery as compared with our own was recognised. The high reputation\r\nof Scotch cooks at the present day seems to be due to an inheritance\r\nof traditions from the days of close association of the Scotch and\r\nFrench Courts. Up to nearly 100 years ago roasting was as usual a\r\nmethod of cooking meat in Paris as in London. There were \"rôtisseries\"\r\nin Paris in the old days. High prices and thrift have led to the\r\ndecadence of roasting as a popular method of cooking meat in France,\r\nbut the great \"chef\" in a private house in Paris still produces the\r\nmost perfect roast beef and roast saddle of mutton (better than you\r\nwill find in England) in the old-fashioned way. So indifferent, or\r\nperhaps hopeless, are Englishmen in regard to cookery that they drink\r\na strong champagne throughout dinner, content to drown the insipid\r\ntaste of the food in the fine flavour of a drink upon which they can\r\nrely. An Englishman dining at a first-rate restaurant will usually\r\nspend twice as much for wine as for food, whilst a Frenchman will\r\nreverse the proportions. Another difference is one for which women are\r\nresponsible. In Paris a party of French men and women at a table in a\r\ngood restaurant enjoy their food, laugh and talk with one another, and\r\ndo not concern themselves with the company at other tables. It would\r\nbe bad manners to do so. But English-speaking women, when dining in\r\npublic, seem to be chiefly interested, not in their food nor in their\r\nown party, but in pointing out to one another the celebrities or\r\nnotorieties or eccentricities seated at other tables. So long as the\r\nplace is fashionable and noisy, the food is negligible and neglected.\r\n\r\nFor some reason, which I am unable to discover, the women of England\r\n(it is not the case with those of France and Germany) have, with rare\r\nexceptions, no interest in or liking for \"cookery,\" and yet the men\r\nhave left the management of it entirely in their hands. Male \"chefs\"\r\nof English nationality are rare specimens, though they are, as a rule,\r\nthe best at grilling and roasting. On the other hand, in France, where\r\nwomen no less than men value and understand cookery, there is an\r\nenormous body of professional male cooks. English-women of means and\r\neducation have to such a degree neglected all knowledge of cookery and\r\nof the quality and criticism of kitchen supplies, such as meat, fish,\r\nbirds, and vegetables, that there is no one to teach the poor country\r\ngirls (who become cooks in the majority of households) the elements of\r\nthe very difficult and important duties which they are expected--in\r\nvirtue of some kind of inspiration or native genius--to discharge with\r\nskill and judgment: nor is there any head of a household capable of\r\nseeing that the necessary care and trouble are given. It is wonderful,\r\nunder the circumstances, how clever and willing our domestic cooks\r\nare. A considerable section of English middle-class women at the\r\npresent day are allowed by the men, who should guide them so as to\r\nmake them honourable and useful members of the community, to grow up\r\nin complete ignorance of the essential parts of the art of cookery.\r\nThis was not the case a hundred years ago. Now a large proportion of\r\nthem have been led by bad example and foolish notions to give up such\r\nmatters to \"the servants,\" whether they are able to afford competent\r\nservants or even to judge of the competence of a servant or not. Many\r\nof these \"mistresses\" now devote themselves exclusively to \"dress,\"\r\n\"amusements,\" \"charity,\" \"politics,\" and dabbling inconsequently in\r\nvarious crazes. They are not to blame. It is the men who are to blame\r\nwho deliberately neglect to give to their womenkind a training and\r\neducation which shall make them real mistresses of household arts and\r\nbusiness, so that they may be thus filled with the happy conviction\r\n(which is the one thing they most desire and most often cannot gain)\r\nthat they are of real use--are really wanted--in the world.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, let me tell of a great German sports-man, Major von\r\nWissman, Governor of German East Africa, now no more, who came to see\r\nme at the Museum nine years ago. It was his first visit to London, and\r\nI took him to lunch at a famous grill-room. Happily, though roasting\r\nis dying out, the art of grilling still survives in this country, but\r\nnowhere else in Europe. Von Wissman said--\"Can I have beer where we\r\nare going?\" \"Yes, certainly,\" I said. \"German beer?\" he asked. \"No,\" I\r\nreplied. \"Something much better.\" When we were seated, I ordered a\r\npint tankard of Reid's London stout for my friend. It was in perfect\r\ncondition. He put his lips to it in doubt, but did not remove them\r\nuntil, with reverential drooping of the eyelids, he had emptied the\r\ntankard. \"The very finest beer I have ever swallowed,\" he said. \"What\r\nin the name of goodness is it?\" I told him, and ordered him more. Soon\r\na perfectly grilled chop and a large, clean, floury potato were before\r\nhim. He proceeded to eat, and was really and unaffectedly astonished.\r\n\"But this is marvellous,\" he said, \"wonderful! enchanting! I have\r\nnever really tasted meat before in my life. Reitzend! Colossal!\" He\r\nhad a steak to follow, and I was pleased to have been able to show him\r\nsomething which I knew (by experience of that city) they could not\r\nproduce in Berlin. Three days later I went over to the same hospitable\r\ngrill-room for a chop, and told the gifted grill-cook (the French, in\r\nformer centuries, had a proverb, \"Anyone may learn to be a cook, but\r\none must be born a 'rotisseur'\") of the admiration he had excited in\r\nthe Emperor William's friend. \"Yes, sir,\" he said, \"I fancy he did\r\nlike it, for he came here by himself yesterday and the day before, and\r\ntook the same grills and stout.\" Von Wissman was staying at the German\r\nEmbassy, but was drawn all the way to South Kensington by the sweet\r\nsavour of the grill-room--an instance of what the physiologists call\r\n\"positive chemotaxis.\"\r\n\r\nWhat I have here written on food and cookery is no \"gourmet's\" praise\r\nof indulgence in the pleasures of the table, nor is it an expression\r\nof a mere personal preference. It is a protest, based on scientific\r\ngrounds, against the neglect of one of the bulwarks of health--the\r\nhonest traditional cookery which flourished in London forty years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nSMELLS AND PERFUMES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old saying, \"_De gustibus non disputandum_,\" is based upon the\r\nfact that both liking and the repulsion evinced by human beings for\r\ndifferent odours (including those odours which we call flavours) are\r\nnot matters of general agreement. Thus the smells of garlic and of\r\nonions, and even of assafoetida, are to many men among the most\r\nattractive and appetising in existence--to very many they are, on the\r\nother hand, repulsive. High game, a certain kind of putrid fish\r\n(\"Bombay ducks\"), and again rotten cheese are attractive to many men\r\nand offensive to as many more. Many animals revel in the smell and\r\nflavour of carrion, and even of manure, which they devour. There are\r\nwell-known flowers which attract insects, not by the possession of the\r\nsweet perfumes appreciated and extracted by mankind, but by a smell\r\nlike that of putrid meat, which so far misleads blue-bottle flies as\r\nto cause them to lay their eggs on the reeking blossom. So diverse are\r\nthe tastes of men and animals in these matters that it is remarkable\r\nwhen we find agreement among them, as, for instance, in the attraction\r\nfor butterflies of those delicate scents which also are agreeable to\r\nourselves in such flowers as the rose, the jasmine, the heliotrope and\r\nthe honeysuckle.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be no rule or principle at work by which smells can be\r\ndefinitely classed as either pleasant or unpleasant. Even perfumes\r\ncarried by some of the inhabitants of Western Europe with the\r\nintention of making themselves attractive to their fellow-citizens are\r\noften repulsive to a certain proportion of those who come near them,\r\nas, for instance, is the case with the extract of the East Indian herb\r\n\"patchouli.\" In regard to our other senses there is a general\r\nagreement amongst mankind, which extends also to all animals, as to\r\nwhat is agreeable and what is disagreeable. There are definite\r\nmathematical laws as to harmony and melody in sound and colour which\r\naffect animals and ourselves to a large extent similarly. Sweets are\r\nagreeable and bitters are disagreeable, though it is the fact that the\r\nsnail, which loves sugar, recoils from saccharine, and there are\r\n\"mites\" (_Acari_) which feed with avidity on bitter strychnine! Excess\r\nof heat and of cold is disliked by animals and all men, whilst the\r\nsense of touch is pleasurably or painfully affected in much the same\r\nway in most men and animals, more than is the case with regard to any\r\nother of the senses. The sense of smell depends upon immediate and\r\npersonal experience of \"association\" for the determination of pleasure\r\nor pain, attraction or repulsion, as the result of its being called\r\ninto operation. It is a very general experience that odours are more\r\nefficient in arousing memory than are mere colour effects or sounds.\r\nNot only in animals with acutely developed olfactory powers, but also\r\nin man, an odour--a peculiar perfume--will start a whole chain of\r\nreminiscence when sight and sound have failed to do so. It is due to\r\nthis close association with memory (conscious or unconscious) that an\r\nodour is agreeable or disagreeable.\r\n\r\nIn itself an odour is neither attractive nor repulsive. The acrid\r\nfumes of sulphur, chlorine, ammonia, and such bodies are not simply\r\n\"odours\" but corrosive chemical vapours, which act painfully upon the\r\nnerves of common sensation within the air-passages of the nose and\r\nthroat and not exclusively, if at all, on the terminations of the\r\nolfactory nerves. An odour--that which acts on the special nerves of\r\nsmell distributed in chambers of the nose--acquires its attractive or\r\nits repulsive quality only as the result of mental association with\r\nwhat is beneficial (suitable food, mates, friends, safety, home, the\r\nnest), or with what is injurious (unsuitable food, poison, enemies,\r\ndanger, strange surroundings, solitude). Hence it is intelligible that\r\nthe man accustomed to garlic or onions in his food is strongly\r\nattracted by their smell. So too the man whose tribe or companions\r\nhave learnt by necessity to eat slightly putrid meat, fish, and cheese\r\nis attracted by their odour, though for others these odours are\r\nassociated rather with what is poisonous and injurious. The dislike of\r\nthe smell of sewer-gas and foul accumulations of refuse was not known\r\nto former generations of men (even in European cities a couple of\r\nhundred years ago) any more than it is to-day to the more unfortunate\r\npoorer classes, to many modern savages, to hyenas, and several other\r\nanimals and birds which inhabit lairs and caves which they make foul.\r\nThe odour of putrescence has become actually painful and almost\r\nintolerable to the more cleanly classes of mankind, owing to the\r\nassociation with it, as the result of education, of fear of disease\r\nand poisoning. Either conscious or unconscious association of an odour\r\nwith what is held, either as the result of tradition or through\r\npersonal experience, to be beneficial and of pleasant memory, or, on\r\nthe contrary, injurious and of painful connection, determines man's\r\nliking for and choice or rejection of, odours and flavours. One can\r\naccount with fair success on this basis for one's own preferences and\r\ndislikes in the matter.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, odours exist in vast variety amongst plants and\r\nanimals which have not acquired any special association or\r\nsignificance. We find that some organisms produce as a result of their\r\nchemical life material which oxidises and gives out light and so these\r\norganisms are \"phosphorescent\" without any consequence, good or bad,\r\nto themselves. And then we come upon others (as, for instance, the\r\nglow-worms and fire-flies) which have made use of this \"accidental\"\r\nquality, and produce phosphorescent light in special organs so as to\r\nattract the opposite sex. Again, we find that the red-coloured\r\noxygen-seizing crystalline substance hæmoglobin exists in the blood of\r\na vast number of animals, and might as well be green or colourless for\r\nall the good its colour does them. Yet here and there the splendid red\r\ncolour which this chemical gives to the blood becomes of great\r\nimportance as a \"decoration,\" or \"sex-ornament.\" The comb of the\r\ndomestic fowl, the wattles of the turkey, but above all the supreme\r\nbeauty of the human race--the cherry-red lips and the crimson-blushing\r\ncheek of healthy youth--owe their wonderful colour to the red blood\r\nwhich flows through them. So at last the redness, of the\r\noxygen-carrier is turned to account. So it must be also with odorous\r\nsubstances. Many have been called into existence, but few have been\r\nchosen in the long course of animal evolution and selected as the\r\nimportant means of repulsion or attraction.\r\n\r\nThere are odorous substances attached to many of the lower animals\r\nwhich seem to have no significance, but just happen to be the result\r\nof necessary chemical changes, not aimed (so to speak) at their\r\nproduction. Of course, it is very difficult to form a certain and\r\ndefinite conclusion as to their uselessness as odours. For instance,\r\nnearly all the sponges when fresh and filled with living protoplasm\r\nhave a curious smell which reminds one of that given off by a stick of\r\nphosphorus. Marine sponges have it and so has the beautiful green or\r\nflesh-coloured liver sponge (common on the wood of rafts and weirs in\r\nthe Thames). A rather uncommon marine worm, called _Balanoglossus_ or\r\nthe acorn worm, has a very strong and unpleasant smell like that of\r\niodoform. In neither case is the nature of the odorous body known, nor\r\nits use to the animal suggested. Smelts smell like cucumbers: the\r\ngreen-bone fish and the mackerel smell alike. One of the common\r\nearth-worms has a strong aromatic smell, and the common snail, as well\r\nas the sea-hare and one of the cuttle-fishes (_Eledone_), smells like\r\nmusk. Musk itself is produced, as a scent attracting the opposite sex,\r\nby several animals--musk-deer, musk-sheep, musk-rats. I am not now\r\nattempting to enumerate the well-recognised odours of animals such as\r\nare extracted from them by man in order to \"opsonize\" himself, but am\r\npointing to the more obscure cases. There is not a very great or\r\nmarked variety in the odours of fishes; but reptiles with their dry,\r\noily skins give off various aromatic smells, none of which are valued\r\nby man. Toads have distinct odours, and one kind (_Pelobates fuscus_,\r\nor the heel-clawed toad), common in Europe, but not British, is known\r\nlocally as the garlic toad on account of its smell. There are amongst\r\ncarnivorous mammals various smells allied to that of civet which are\r\nnot so agreeable to man as that substance; for instance, the odour of\r\nthe fox and of the badger, and yet more celebrated, the terrible,\r\nawe-inspiring smell of the fluid emitted in self-defence by the skunk\r\nfrom a sac in the hinder part of the body. Horses, cows, goats, sheep,\r\nand the giraffe have their distinctive odours. Many of the herbivorous\r\nanimals secrete a colourless fluid from large glands opening on or\r\nnear the feet, and also from a gland in front of the eye (similar\r\nglands occur in other strange positions), which has not a smell\r\nfamiliar to man--that is to say, not one which has been recognised and\r\ndescribed--yet seems to be readily \"smelt\" by the animals of its own\r\nkind. The bats--especially the large frugivorous bats--have a very\r\nunpleasant, frowsy smell.\r\n\r\nAn important fact about animal smells is that many which we might be\r\ninclined to attribute to the animal which diffuses them, are really\r\ndue to the fermentative or putrefactive action of bacteria which swarm\r\non the skin and in the intestines of animals. It is often difficult to\r\ndecide how far a peculiar animal odour is due directly to a substance\r\nsecreted by the animal, and how far the odour of that substance is\r\nmodified or even entirely produced by the chemical changes set up in\r\nsecretions of the body-surface by bacteria. Several distinct repulsive\r\nsmells liable to occur on the human body are due to want of\r\ncleanliness in destroying bacteria by proper antiseptics. The fatty\r\nand waxy secretions of the skin are often decomposed by bacteria, even\r\nbefore complete extrusion from the glands in which they are formed,\r\nwhilst the decomposition of food in the mouth and intestines by\r\nbacteria alters materially both the natural odour of the animal's\r\nbreath and the smell of the intestinal contents. In young and healthy\r\nanimals in natural conditions there is some check--it is not easy to\r\nsay what--upon the putrefactive activities of the omnipresent\r\nbacteria. The skin of a healthy young animal has a pleasant odour,\r\nand its breath (notably in the case of the cow and the giraffe) is\r\nnaturally sweet-smelling. The same should be the case, under perfectly\r\nhealthy conditions, with human beings.\r\n\r\nThere is one important cause of animal odours and flavours upon which\r\nI have not hitherto touched. Many animals acquire an odour or flavour\r\ndirectly from the food upon which they feed. Certain odorous bodies\r\nare in the food and are taken up into the blood of the consuming\r\nanimal unchanged, and are then thrown out by secreting glands on the\r\nskin. This is the case with the odorous substance of onions. People do\r\nnot smell of onions after they have eaten them in consequence of\r\nparticles of onion remaining in the mouth. The volatile odoriferous\r\nmatter of the onion is absorbed into the blood. It passes out first\r\nthrough the lungs and later through the small fat-forming glands in\r\nthe skin. It is difficult to ascertain how far animals derive their\r\nodours in this way in a complete state from their food, and how far\r\nthey chemically construct them afresh by their own activity. No doubt\r\nboth processes occur; but in plants the odorous bodies are built up\r\nentirely by the chemical action of the plant itself upon simple salts\r\nof carbonic acid, ammonia and nitrates. Animals can certainly take\r\nhighly elaborated chemical bodies into their digestive organs without\r\ndestroying them and absorb them unchanged into the blood and deposit\r\nthem in the tissues. Thus the canary is made to take up the red colour\r\nof cayenne pepper and deposit it in the feathers. Thus the green\r\noysters of Marennes acquire their colour from minute blue plants\r\n(diatoms) on which they feed. And thus, too, the canvas-backed ducks\r\nof the United States take into their tissues the odorous matter of\r\ncelery, and our own grouse the flavour of heather, whilst fish-eating\r\nbirds and whales in this way acquire a fishy taste. So, too, the\r\nflounders and the eels of the Thames, and even salmon in muddy rivers,\r\nacquire a taste like the smell of river mud. It is probable that many\r\nof the odours of animals (but by no means all) are thus derived\r\ndirectly from their food, or are produced by very slight changes of\r\nthe odorous bodies absorbed in food. Mutton and beef owe their savour\r\nin some degree to the scents of the grasses on which sheep and oxen\r\nfeed. And it is not improbable that the sheep-like smell which the\r\nChinese detect in the European, comes to the latter direct from his\r\ngeneral use of the sheep as food.\r\n\r\nPlants are the great chemical manufacturers in the world of life, and\r\nsecond to them come our human industrial and scientific chemists. And\r\nthough we must claim for animals some power of manufacturing distinct\r\nodorous bodies from inodorous nutritive matter assimilated by them, it\r\nis probable that in many cases the odour which is characteristic of an\r\nanimal is derived by no very complicated change from odorous bodies\r\nexisting in its habitual food.\r\n\r\nA curious case of a substance valued as perfume by civilised man, and\r\nyet coming from a source whence sweet odours would hardly be expected,\r\nis that which is known as \"ambergris,\" or \"ambre gris\" (grey amber).\r\nIt is still used in the manufacture of esteemed perfumes, and is sold\r\nat five guineas the ounce. It is found floating on the surface of the\r\nocean, and is a concretion of imperfectly digested matter from the\r\nintestine of a whale--probably the sperm-whale. It is a grey, powdery\r\nsubstance, and in it are embedded innumerable fragments of the horny\r\nbeaks and sucker-rings of cuttle-fishes--creatures which form the\r\nchief food of the sperm-whale and other toothed whales. I have already\r\nmentioned above that one of our common cuttle-fishes (the _Eledone\r\nmoschata_) has a strong odour of musk, and it is possible that\r\nambergris owes its perfume to the musk-like scent of the cuttle-fish\r\neaten by the whale in whose intestine it is formed. Another \"smell\"\r\nwhich is extremely mysterious is that produced by two quartz-pebbles,\r\nor even two rock-crystals, or two pebbles of flint or of corundum,\r\nwhen rubbed one against the other. A flash of light is seen, and this\r\nis accompanied by a very distinct smell, like that given out by\r\nburning cotton-wool. It is demonstrated--by careful chemical cleaning\r\nbefore the experiment--that this is not due to the presence of any\r\norganic matter on or in the stones or crystals used. It seems to be an\r\nexception to the rule that \"odours\" (as distinct from pungent vapours\r\nor gases) are only produced by substances formed by plants or animals.\r\nPerhaps that is not so completely a rule as I was inclined to think.\r\nIt is true that one can distinguish the \"smells\" of chlorine, of\r\nbromine, and of iodine from one another. And there are statements\r\ncurrent as to the distinctive smells of metals--though they may\r\npossibly be due to the action of the metals on organic matter. In any\r\ncase it seems, according to our present knowledge, that the smell\r\ngiven out by the rubbing of pieces of silica (quartz, flint, etc.) is\r\ndue to particles of silica (oxide of silicon) volatilised by the heat\r\nof friction, which are capable of acting specifically on the olfactory\r\nsense-organ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nKISSES\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Among thy fancies, tell me this,\r\n    What is the thing we call a kiss?\r\n    I shall resolve ye what it is.\"\r\n\r\n    --Robert Herrick\r\n\r\nKissing is an extremely ancient habit of mankind coming to us from far\r\nbeyond the range of history, and undoubtedly practised by the remote\r\nanimal-like ancestors of the human race. Poets have exalted it, and in\r\nthese hygienic days doctors have condemned it. In the United States\r\nthey have even proposed to forbid it by law, on the ground that\r\ndisease germs may be (and undeniably are in some cases) conveyed by it\r\nfrom one individual to another. But it is too deep-rooted in human\r\nnature, and has a significance and origin too closely associated with\r\nhuman well-being in the past, and even in the present, to permit of\r\nits being altogether \"tabooed\" by medical authority.\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of \"kissing\" practised by mankind at the present\r\ntime--one takes the form of \"nose-rubbing\"--each kiss-giver rubbing\r\nhis nose against that of the other. The second kind, which is that\r\nfamiliar to us in Europe, consists in pressing the lips against the\r\nlips, skin, or hair of another individual, and making a short, quick\r\ninspiration, resulting in a more or less audible sound. Both kinds are\r\nreally of the nature of \"sniffing,\" the active effort to smell or\r\nexplore by the olfactory sense. The \"nose-kiss\" exists in races so far\r\napart from one another as the Maoris of New Zealand and the Esquimaux\r\nof the Arctic regions. It is the habit of the Chinese, of the Malays,\r\nand other Asiatic races. The only Europeans who practise it are the\r\nLaplanders. The lip-kiss is distinguished by some authorities as \"the\r\nsalute by taste\" from nose-rubbing, which is \"the salute by smell.\"\r\nThe word \"kiss\" is connected by Skeat with the Latin \"gustus,\" taste;\r\nboth words signify essentially \"choice.\" But it would be a mistake to\r\nregard the lip-kiss as merely an effort to taste in the strict sense,\r\nsince the act of inspiration accompanying it brings the olfactory\r\npassages of the nose into play. Lip-kissing is frequently mentioned in\r\nthe most ancient Hebrew books of the Bible, and it was also the method\r\nof affectionate salutation among the Ancient Greeks. Primarily both\r\nkinds of kissing were, there can be no doubt, an act of exploration,\r\ndiscrimination, and recognition dependent on the sense of smell. The\r\nmore primitive character of the kiss is retained by the lovers' kiss,\r\nthe mother's kissing and sniffing of her babe, and by the kiss of\r\nsalutation to a friend returning from or setting out on a distant\r\njourney. Identification and memorising by the sense of smell is the\r\nremote origin and explanation of those kisses. The kissing of one\r\nanother by grown-up men as a salutation was abandoned in this country\r\nas late as the eighteenth century. \"'Tis not the fashion here,\" says a\r\nLondon gentleman to his country-bred friend in Congreve's \"Way of the\r\nWorld.\" But we have, most of us, witnessed it abroad, and perhaps been\r\nunexpectedly subjected to the process, as I once was by an\r\naffectionate scientific colleague. Independently of the more ordinary\r\npractice of kissing--there is the \"ceremonial kiss\"--the kissing of\r\nhands, or of feet and toes, which still survives in Court\r\nfunctions--whilst the Viennese and the Spaniards, though they no\r\nlonger actually carry out their threat, habitually startle a foreigner\r\nby exclaiming--\"I kiss your hands.\" The Russian Sclavs are the most\r\nprofuse and indiscriminate of European peoples in their kissing. I\r\nhave seen a Russian gentleman about to depart on a journey \"devoured\"\r\nby the kisses of his relations and household retainers, male and\r\nfemale. Among the poor in rural districts in Russia this excessive\r\nhabit of kissing leads to the propagation of the most terrible\r\nulcerative disease among innocent people--as related by Metchnikoff in\r\nthe lectures on modern hygiene which he gave in London some seven or\r\neight years ago (published by Heinemann).\r\n\r\nWe may take it, then, that the act of kissing is primarily and in its\r\nremote origin an exploration by the sense of smell, which has either\r\nlost its original significance, and become ceremonial, or has, even\r\nthough still appealing to the sense of smell, ceased to be (if,\r\nindeed, it ever was so) consciously and deliberately an exercise of\r\nthat sense. This leads us to the very interesting subject of the sense\r\nof smell in man and in other animals. There is no doubt that the sense\r\nof smell is not so acute in man as it is in many of the higher\r\nanimals, and even in some of the lower forms, such as insects. It is\r\nthe fact that so far as we can trace its existence and function in\r\nanimals, the sense of smell is of prime importance as distinguishing\r\nodours which are associated either with objects or conditions\r\nfavourable to the individual and its race, or, on the other hand,\r\nhostile and injurious to it. It never reaches such an extended\r\ndevelopment as a source of information or general relation of the\r\nindividual to its surroundings as do the senses of sight, hearing and\r\ntouch. It depends for its utility on the existence of odorous bodies\r\nwhich are not very widely present, and are far from universal\r\naccompaniments of natural objects. Apart from some pungent mineral\r\ngases, all odorous bodies are of organic origin. Even as recognised by\r\nthe less acute olfactory sense of man, the number and variety of\r\nagreeable and of disagreeable scents, produced by various species of\r\nanimals and plants, is very considerable. But there is no doubt that\r\nthe number and variety discriminated by such animals as dogs and many\r\nof the other hairy, warm-blooded beasts is far greater. The nature of\r\nthe particles given off by odorous bodies which act on the\r\nnerve-endings of the organs of smell of animals, is remarkable. They\r\nare volatile; that is to say, they are thrown off from their source\r\nand float in the air in a state of extreme subdivision. Unlike the\r\nparticles which act upon the nerves of taste, they are not\r\nnecessarily soluble in water, and though often spread through and\r\ncarried by liquids, are in fact rarely dissolved in water. The\r\ndissolved particles which act upon the nerves of taste can be\r\ndistinguished by man into four groups--sweet, sour, bitter, and\r\nsaline. But no such classification of \"smells\" is possible. As a rule\r\nmankind confuses the \"taste\" of things with their accompanying\r\n\"smell.\" The finer flavours of food and drink not included in the four\r\nclasses of tastes are really due to odoriferous particles present in\r\nthe food or drink, which act on the terminations of the olfactory\r\nnerves in the recesses of the nose, and excite no sensation through\r\nthe nerves of taste.\r\n\r\nThe part of the brain from which the nerves of smell arise is of\r\nrelatively enormous size in the lower vertebrates--as much as one\r\nfifth of the volume of the entire brain in fishes--a fact which seems\r\nto indicate great importance for the sense of smell in those forms.\r\nEven in the mammals (the hairy, warm-blooded, young-suckling beasts)\r\nthe size of the olfactory lobes of the brain and of the olfactory\r\nnerves, and the labyrinthine chambers of the nose on which the nerves\r\nare spread, is very large, as one may see by looking at a mammal's\r\nskull divided into right and left halves. And it seems immoderately\r\nlarge to us--to man--because, after all, so far as our conscious lives\r\nare concerned, the sense of smell has very small importance. Yet man\r\nhas a very considerable set of olfactive chambers within the nostrils\r\nand has large olfactory nerves. Not rarely men and women are found who\r\nare absolutely devoid of the sense of smell, and the same thing occurs\r\nwith domesticated cats and dogs. In these cases the olfactory lobes of\r\nthe brain are imperfectly developed. It is found that men in this\r\ncondition suffer but little inconvenience in consequence. We are able,\r\nthrough their statements, to ascertain what parts of the savoury\r\nqualities of food and drink belong to taste and what to smell. Such\r\nindividuals do not perceive perfumes, the bouquet of wine, or the\r\nfragrance of tobacco, nor can they appreciate the artistic efforts of\r\na good cook. But they are spared the pain of foul smells, and\r\npossibly in this way they may incur some danger in civilised life\r\nthrough not being able to detect the escape of sewer-gas or of\r\ncoal-gas into a house, or the putrid condition of ice-stored fish,\r\nbirds, and meat. A friend of my own, who is devoid of the sense of\r\nsmell, inherited this defect from his father, and has transmitted it\r\nto some of his children. I was surprised to find in conversing with\r\nhim how often I alluded to smells, either pleasant or unpleasant, when\r\n(as we had agreed he should) he would interrupt me and say that my\r\nremark had no meaning for him.\r\n\r\nSome have a far more acute sense of smell than others, and again some\r\nmen, probably without being more acutely endowed in that way, pay more\r\nattention to smells, and use the memory of them in description and\r\nconversation. Guy de Maupassant is remarkable as a writer for his\r\nabundant introduction of references to agreeable and mysterious\r\nperfumes, and also to repulsive odours. But some men certainly have an\r\nexceptionally acute sense of smell, and can, on entering an empty\r\nroom, recognise that such and such a person has been there by the\r\nfaint traces--not of perfumery carried by the visitor--but of his\r\nindividual smell or odour. This brings us to one of the most important\r\nfacts about odorous bodies and the sense of smell, namely, that not\r\nonly do the various species of animals (and plants) each have their\r\nown odour--often difficult or impossible for man, with his aborted\r\nolfactory powers, to distinguish--but that every individual has its\r\nown special odour. As to how far this can be considered a universal\r\ndisposition is doubtful. It is probable that the power of\r\ndiscriminating such individual odours is limited (even in the case of\r\ndogs, where it is sometimes very highly developed), to a power of\r\ndiscriminating the distinctive smells of the individuals of certain\r\nspecies of animals, and not of every individual of every species.\r\nEveryone knows of the wonderful power of the bloodhound in tracking an\r\nindividual man by his smell, but dogs of other breeds also often\r\npossess what seems to us extraordinary powers of the kind. On a pebbly\r\nbeach I pick up one smooth flint pebble as big as a walnut. It is\r\nclosely similar to thousands of others lying there. I hold it in my\r\nhand without letting my fox-terrier see it, and then I throw it. It\r\ndrops some eighty yards off among the other pebbles, and I could not\r\nmyself find it again. But the dog runs forward, notes vaguely by ear\r\nand by eye the spot where it strikes, and then commences a systematic\r\ncircling within about ten yards of the spot. In half a minute he\r\npounces with the utmost assurance on to one selected stone, and brings\r\nit to me. It is invariably the stone which had been in my hand, unseen\r\nby the dog, thrown by me, and detected by the smell I have\r\ncommunicated to it.\r\n\r\nNot only is the discrimination of individuals by the sense of smell a\r\nvery astonishing thing, but so also is the obvious fact that the total\r\namount of odoriferous matter which is sufficient to give a definite\r\nand discriminative sensation through the organ of smell is of a\r\nminuteness beyond all calculation or conception. These two facts--the\r\nalmost infinite individual diversity of smell and the almost infinite\r\nminuteness of the particles exciting it--render it very difficult to\r\nform a satisfactory conclusion as to the nature of those particles. It\r\nhas been from time to time suggested that the end organs of the\r\nolfactory nerves may be excited, not by chemically active particles,\r\nbut by \"rays,\" olfactive undulations comparable to those of light.\r\nPhysicists have not yet been able to deal with the problem, but the\r\nrecent discoveries and theories as to radio-active bodies such as\r\nradium may possibly lead to some more plausible theory as to the\r\ndiffusion and minuteness of odorous particles than any which has yet\r\nbeen formulated. An example of the minuteness of odoriferous particles\r\nis afforded by a piece of musk which for ten years in succession has\r\ngiven off into the changing air of an ordinary room \"particles\"\r\ncausing a readily recognised smell of musk, and yet is found at the\r\nend of that time to have lost no weight, that is to say, no weight\r\nwhich can be appreciated by the finest chemical balance. An analogy (I\r\nsay only an analogy, a resemblance) to this is furnished by a pinch of\r\nthe salt known as radium chloride, no bigger than a rape-seed, and\r\nenclosed in a glass tube, which will continue for months and years to\r\nemit penetrating particles producing continuously without cessation\r\nmost obvious luminous and electrical effects upon distant objects, the\r\nparticles being so minute that no loss of weight can be detected in\r\nthe pinch of salt from which they are given off.\r\n\r\nThe sense of smell is of service to animals--\r\n\r\n(1) In avoiding enemies and noxious things.\r\n\r\n(2) In tracing and following and discriminating prey or other food.\r\n\r\n(3) In recognising members of their own species and individuals of\r\ntheir own herd or troop, and in finding their own young and their own\r\nnests.\r\n\r\n(4) In seeking individuals of the opposite sex at the breeding season.\r\n\r\nIt is in connection with the last of these services that we come\r\nacross some of the most curious observations as to the production and\r\nperception of odorous particles. Butterflies and moths and some other\r\ninsects have olfactory organs in the ends of the antennæ and the\r\n\"palps\" about the mouth. The perfumes of flowers have been developed\r\nso as to attract insects by the sense of smell, as their colours have\r\nbeen also developed to attract insects by the eye. The insects serve\r\nthe flowers by carrying the fertilizing pollen from one flower to\r\nanother, and thus promoting cross-fertilization among separate\r\nindividual plants of the same species. But probably concurrently with\r\nthis has grown up the production of perfume by the scales on the wings\r\nof moths and butterflies--perfumes which have the most powerful\r\nattraction for the opposite sex of the same species. Curiously enough\r\n(for these perfumes might very well exist without being detected by\r\nman) some of the perfumes produced by butterflies are \"smellable\" by\r\nman. That of the green-veined white is described as resembling the\r\nagreeable odour of the lemon verbena. It is produced by certain scales\r\non the front border of the hinder wings of the male insects, and not\r\nat all by the females, who are, however, attracted by it, and flutter\r\naround the sweet-smelling male. Other male butterflies produce a scent\r\nlike that of sweet briar, others like honeysuckle, others like\r\njasmine, and so attract the females. Other butterflies are known which\r\nproduce repulsive odours, and so protect themselves from being eaten\r\nby birds and lizards. Again, there are moths (for instance, the\r\nemperor moth, Saturnia), the females of which produce a perfume which\r\nattracts the males, and is of far-reaching power. The French\r\nentomologist, Fabre, placed one of these female moths in a box covered\r\nwith net-gauze, and left it in a room with open window, facing the\r\ncountryside. In less than an hour the room was full of male emperor\r\nmoths--more than a hundred arrived, although none had been previously\r\nvisible in the neighbourhood. They crowded over the box, and even\r\nafterwards, when the female moth had been removed, the perfume\r\nremained in the box, and the male moths eagerly sought it. The perfume\r\nmust have carried far from the room where the female was, out into the\r\nwoods where it was perceived, and followed up to its source by the\r\nmale moths.\r\n\r\nSuch perfumes are very generally produced by little pockets or glands\r\nin the skin, the secretion having, in the case of insects, birds and\r\nmammals, an oily nature. In mammals they are largely produced by both\r\nmales and females, and serve to attract the sexes to one another.\r\nHairs are situated close to the minute odoriferous glands and serve an\r\nimportant part in accumulating and diffusing the characteristic\r\nperfume. Musk and civet are of this nature, and it is a significant\r\nfact that these substances are used as perfumes by human beings. It\r\nwould seem as though mankind had lost either the power of\r\nsatisfactorily perceiving the perfumes naturally produced by the human\r\nskin, or that the production of such perfumes had for some reason\r\ndiminished. Either condition would account for the use by mankind of\r\nthe perfumes of other animals and of flowers. There are a variety of\r\nodorous substances produced by different parts of the human body, of\r\nwhich some are agreeable and others disagreeable. One of the most\r\ncurious facts in regard to odorous bodies is the close resemblance\r\nbetween agreeable and repulsive odours, and the readiness with which\r\nthe judgment of human beings may pronounce the same odour agreeable at\r\none period or place, and disagreeable at another. There also seems to\r\nbe a \"dulling\" of the power to perceive an odour which is a\r\nconsequence of constant exposure to that odour. Thus the Chinese say\r\nthat Europeans all smell unpleasantly, the odour resembling that of\r\nsheep, although we do not observe it; whilst Europeans notice and\r\ndislike the smell of the negro, a smell of the existence of which he\r\nis unaware. The blood of animals, including that of man, has, when\r\nfreshly shed, a smell peculiar to the species, which has not, however,\r\nany resemblance to that of the skin or of the waxy glands of the same\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nIt seems that in regard to the exercise of the sense of smell by man,\r\nwe must distinguish not only greater from less acuteness and variety\r\nof perception, but in the case of this sense-organ, as in regard to\r\nthe others, we must distinguish \"unconscious\" from \"conscious\"\r\nsensation. All our movements are guided and determined by sensations\r\nto touch and sight, and to some extent, of hearing, of which we are\r\nunconscious. A vast amount of our sense-experience comes to us and is\r\nrecorded without our having consciousness of anything of the kind\r\ngoing on. It is probable that the world of smells in which a dog with\r\na fine olfactive sense lives, produces little or nothing in the dog's\r\nmind which is equivalent to our conscious perception of degrees of\r\nagreeable and disagreeable odours. The dog is simply attracted and\r\nrepulsed in this direction and in that by the operation of his\r\nolfactive organs, without, so to speak, giving any attention to the\r\nsensation which is guiding him or being \"aware\" of it. No doubt at\r\ntimes, and with special intensities of smell, he is, in his way,\r\nconscious of a specific sensation. It is probable that whilst man's\r\ngeneral acuteness in perceiving and discriminating smells has dwindled\r\n(as has that of the apes) in comparison with what it was in his remote\r\nanimal ancestry, yet he retains a large inherited capacity of\r\nunconscious smell-sense, which most of us are unable to recognise,\r\nalthough it is there, operating in ourselves unknown to us and\r\nunobserved. The consciousness of smell-sensations is what we value and\r\ntalk of. It does not extend to the more primal smell-excitations,\r\nexcept in extraordinary individuals. Thus, it seems to be not\r\nimprobable that we are attracted or repelled by other human\r\nindividuals by the unconscious operation upon us of attractive or\r\nrepulsive odours, and that the unaccountable liking or disliking which\r\nwe sometimes experience in regard to other individuals is due to\r\nperfumes and odours emanating from such persons, which act upon us\r\nthrough our olfactory organs without our being conscious of the fact.\r\nIt seems that we can thus arrive at a probable explanation of the\r\nuniversality of the habit of kissing, and of \"what is that thing we\r\ncall a kiss.\" It is not consciously used among civilised populations\r\nas a deliberate attempt to smell the person kissed, but it\r\nnevertheless serves to allow the unconscious exercise of\r\nsmell-preference, testing, and selection, with which are mingled, more\r\nor less frequently, moments of conscious appreciation of the complex\r\nof odours appertaining as an individual quality to the person kissed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nLAUGHTER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ancients associated laughter with the New Year. I am not sure\r\nwhether or no it is of good omen to begin the New Year with laughter.\r\nOmens are such tricky things that I have given up paying any attention\r\nto them. One would think it might be held to be unlucky to stumble on\r\nthe doorstep as you set out from home, but the old omen-wizards,\r\napparently from sheer love of contradiction, said, \"Not at all! It is\r\nunlucky to stumble as you come into the house, and therefore it is\r\nlucky to stumble as you go out!\"\r\n\r\nWhat is laughter? It is a spasmodic movement of various muscles of the\r\nbody, beginning with those which half close the eyes and those which\r\ndraw backwards and upwards the sides of the mouth, and open it so as\r\nto expose the teeth, next affecting those of respiration so as to\r\nproduce short rapidly succeeding expirations accompanied by sound\r\n(called \"guffaws\" when in excess) and then extending to the limbs,\r\ncausing up and down movement of the half-closed fists and stamping of\r\nthe feet, and ending in a rolling on the ground and various\r\ncontortions of the body. Clapping the hands is not part of the\r\nlaughter \"process,\" but a separate, often involuntary, action which\r\nhas the calling of attention to oneself as its explanation, just as\r\nslapping the ground or a table or one's thigh has. Laughter is\r\nspontaneous, that is to say, the movements are not designed or\r\ndirected by the conscious will. But in mankind, in proportion as\r\nindividuals are trained in self-control, it is more or less completely\r\nunder command, and in spite of the most urgent tendency of the\r\nautomatic mechanism to enter upon the progressive series of movements\r\nwhich we distinguish as (1) smile, (2) broad smile or grin, (3)\r\nlaugh, (4) loud laughter, (5) paroxysms of uncontrolled laughter, a\r\nman or woman can prevent all indication by muscular movement of a\r\ndesire to laugh or even to smile. Usually laughter is excited by\r\ncertain pleasurable emotions, and is to be regarded as an \"expression\"\r\nof such emotion just as certain movements and the flow of tears are an\r\n\"expression\" of the painful emotion of grief and physical suffering,\r\nand as other movements of the face and limbs are an \"expression\" of\r\nanger, others of \"fear.\" The Greek gods of Olympus enjoyed\r\n\"inextinguishable laughter.\"\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to see how far we can account for the strange\r\nmovements of laughter as part of the inherited automatic mechanism of\r\nman. Why do we laugh? What is the advantage to the individual or the\r\nspecies of \"laughing\"? Why do we \"express\" our pleasurable emotion and\r\nwhy in this way? It is said that the outcast diminutive race of Ceylon\r\nknown as the Veddas never laugh, and it has even been seriously but\r\nerroneously stated that the muscles which move the face in laughter\r\nare wanting in them. A planter induced some of these people to camp in\r\nhis \"compound,\" or park, in order to learn something of their habits,\r\nlanguage, and beliefs. One day he said to the chief man of the little\r\ntribe, \"You Veddas never laugh. Why do you never laugh?\" The little\r\nwild man replied, \"It is true; we never laugh. What is there for us to\r\nlaugh at?\"--an answer almost terrible in its pathetic submission to a\r\njoyless life. For laughter is primarily, to all races and conditions\r\nof men, the accompaniment, the expression of the simple joy of life.\r\nIt has acquired a variety of relations and significations in the\r\ncourse of the long development of conscious man--but primarily it is\r\nan expression of emotion, set going by the experience of the\r\nelementary joys of life--the light and heat of the sun, the approach\r\nof food, of love of triumph.\r\n\r\nBefore we look further into the matter it is well to note some\r\nexceptional cases of the causation of laughter. The first of these is\r\nthe excitation of laughter by a purely mechanical \"stimulus\" or action\r\nfrom the exterior, without any corresponding mental emotion of\r\njoy--namely by \"tickling,\" that is to say, by light rubbing or\r\ntouching of the skin under the arms or at the side of the neck, or on\r\nthe soles of the feet. Yet a certain readiness to respond is necessary\r\non the part of the person who is \"tickled,\" for, although an unwilling\r\nsubject may be thus made to laugh, yet there are conditions of mind\r\nand of body in which \"tickling\" produces no response. I do not propose\r\nto discuss why it is that \"tickling,\" or gentle friction of the skin\r\nproduces laughter. It is probably one of those cases in which a\r\nmechanism of the living body is set to work, as a machine may be, by\r\ndirectly causing the final movement (say the turning of a wheel), for\r\nthe production of which a special train of apparatus, to be started by\r\nthe letting loose of a spring or the turning of a steam-cock, is\r\nprovided, and in ordinary circumstance is the regular mode in which\r\nthe working of the mechanism is started. The apparatus of laughter is\r\nwhen due to \"tickling\" set at work by a short cut to the nerves and\r\nrelated muscles without recourse to the normal emotional steam-cock.\r\n\r\nThen we have laughter which is purely due to imitation and suggestion.\r\nPeople laugh because others are laughing, without knowing why. This\r\nthrows a good deal of light on the significance of laughter. It is\r\nessentially a social appeal and response. Only in rare cases do people\r\nlaugh when they are alone. Under conditions which in the presence of\r\nothers would cause them to laugh they only \"chuckle\" or smile, and\r\nmay, though ready to burst into laughter, not even exhibit its minor\r\nexpressions when alone. On the other hand, some sane people have the\r\nhabit of laughing aloud when alone, and there is a recognised form of\r\nidiocy which is accompanied by incessant laughter, ceasing only with\r\nsleep. Then there is that peculiar condition of laughter which is\r\ncalled \"giggling,\" which is laughter asserting itself in spite of\r\nefforts made to restrain it, and frequently only because the occasion\r\nis one when the \"giggler\" is especially anxious not to laugh. This\r\nkind of \"inverted suggestion,\" as in the case where an individual\r\n\"blurts out\" the very word or phrase which he is anxious not to use,\r\nis obviously not primitive, but connected with the long training and\r\ndrilling of mankind into approved \"behaviour\" by \"taboos\" and\r\nrestrictive injunctions. Efforts to behave correctly, by causing\r\nanxiety and mental disturbance in excitable or so-called \"nervous\"\r\nsubjects, lead to an over mastering impulse to do the very thing which\r\nmust not be done!\r\n\r\nIt seems that laughter has its origin far back in the animal ancestry\r\nof man, and is essentially an expression to others of the joy and\r\nexhilaration felt by the laugher. It is an appeal through the eye and\r\near for sympathy and comradeship in enjoyment. Its use to social\r\nanimals is in the binding together of the members of a group or\r\nsociety in common feeling and action. Many monkeys laugh, some of them\r\ngrinning so as to show the teeth, partly opening the mouth and making\r\nsounds by spasmodic breathing, identical with those made by man. I\r\nhave seen and heard the chimpanzees at the Zoological Gardens laugh\r\nlike children at the approach of their friend and my friend, the\r\ndistinguished naturalist, Mr. George Boulenger, F.R.S., recognising\r\nhim among the crowd in front of their cage when he was still far off.\r\nAnd I have often made chimpanzees laugh--\"roar with laughter,\" and\r\nroll over in excitement--by tickling them under the arms. The saying\r\nof Aristotle (inscribed over the curtain of the Palais Royal Theatre\r\nin Paris) that \"Laughter is better than tears, because laughter is the\r\nspeciality of man,\" is not true. Not only do the higher apes and some\r\nof the smaller monkeys laugh, but dogs also laugh, although they do\r\nnot make sounds whilst indulging in \"spasms of laughter.\" But their\r\ndistant cousin, the hyena, does laugh aloud, and its laughter agrees\r\nwith that of the dog and with the laughter of children and grown men\r\nin simpler moods in that it is caused by the pleasurable emotion set\r\nup by the imminent gratification of a healthy desire. The hyena\r\nlaughs, the dog grins and bounds, the child laughs and jumps for joy\r\nat the approach of something good to eat. But it is a curious fact\r\nthat the whole attitude is changed when the food is within reach, and\r\nthe serious business of consuming it has commenced! Nor, indeed, is\r\nthe satisfaction which is felt after the gratification of appetite\r\naccompanied by laughter. It seems that the display of the teeth by\r\ndrawing back the corners of the mouth, which is called a \"grin,\" and\r\nis associated in many dogs with a short, sharp, demonstrative bark,\r\nand in mankind with the cackle we call a \"laugh,\" is a retention, a\r\nsurvival, of the playful, good-natured movement of gently biting or\r\npulling a companion with the teeth used by our animal ancestors to\r\ndraw attention to their joy and to communicate it to others. Gradually\r\nit has lost the actual character of a friendly bite; the fore-feet or\r\nhand pull instead of the teeth; the sound emitted has become further\r\ndifferentiated from other sounds made by the animal. But the movement\r\nfor the display of the teeth, though no longer needed as a part of the\r\nact of gripping, remains as an understood and universal indication of\r\njoy and kindly feeling. So universal is it that this friendly display\r\nof the teeth under the name \"smile\" is attributed to Nature, to\r\nFortune, and to deities by all races of men when those powers seem to\r\nfavour them.\r\n\r\nLaughter is, then, in its essence and origin, a communication or\r\nexpression to others of the joyous mood of the laugher. There are many\r\nand strangely varied occasions when laughter seizes on man, and it is\r\ninteresting to see how far they can be explained by this conception of\r\nthe primary and essential nature of the laugh, for many of them seem\r\nat first sight remote from it. There is, first of all, the laughter of\r\nrevivification and escape from death or danger. After railway\r\naccidents, earthquakes, and such terrible occurrences, those who have\r\nbeen in great danger often burst into laughter. The nervous balance\r\nhas been upset by the shock (we call them \"shocking accidents\"), and\r\nthe emotional joy of escape, the joy of recovered life, asserts itself\r\nin what appears to the onlooker to be an unseemly, an unfeeling laugh.\r\nIt is recorded that one of the entombed French coal miners, who two\r\nyears ago were imprisoned without food or light for twenty days a\r\nthousand feet below in the bowels of the earth, burst into a ghastly\r\nlaugh when he was rescued and brought to the upper air once more. The\r\nGreeks and Romans in some of their festal ceremonies made the priest\r\nor actor who represented dead nature returning to life in the spring,\r\nburst into a laugh--a ceremonial or \"ritual\" laugh. Our poets speak of\r\nthe smiles, and even of the laughter of spring, and that is why\r\nlaughter is appropriate to New Year's Day. It is the laughter of\r\nescape from the death of winter and of return to life, for the true\r\nand old-established New Year's Day was not in mid-winter, but a\r\nquarter of a year later, when buds and flowers are bursting into life.\r\nIt is recorded by ancient writers that the \"ritual laugh\" was enforced\r\nby the Sardinians and others who habitually killed their old people\r\n(their parents) upon their victims. They smiled and laughed as part of\r\nthe ceremony, the executioners also smiling. The old people were\r\nsupposed to laugh with joy at the revivification which was in store\r\nfor them in a future state. So, too, the Hindoo widows used to laugh\r\nwhen seated on the funeral pyre ready to be burnt. So, too, is\r\nexplained (by Reinach) the laughter of Joan of Arc when she made her\r\nabjuration in front of the faggots which were to burn her to death.\r\nHer laugh was caused by the thought of her escape from persecution and\r\nof the joyful resurrection soon to come. It was not an indication that\r\nshe was not serious, and that her abjuration of witchcraft was a\r\nfarce, as her enemies asserted.\r\n\r\nMore difficult to explain is the laughter excited by scenes or\r\nnarrations which we call ludicrous, funny, grotesque, comic; and still\r\nmore so the derisive and contemptuous laugh. Caricature or burlesque\r\nof well known men is a favourite method of producing laughter among\r\nsavages as well as civilised peoples. Why do we laugh when a man on\r\nthe stage searches everywhere for his hat, which is all the time on\r\nhis head? Why do we laugh when a pompous gentleman slips on a piece of\r\norange-peel and falls to the ground, or when one buffoon unexpectedly\r\nhits another on the head, and, before he has time to recover, with\r\nequal unexpectedness hooks his legs with a stick and brings him\r\nheavily to the ground? Why did we laugh at the adventures of Mr.\r\nPenley in \"Charley's Aunt\"? In all of these \"ludicrous\" affairs there\r\nis an element of surprise, a slight shock which puts us off our mental\r\nbalance, and the subsequent laughter, when we realise either that no\r\nserious harm has been done or that the whole thing is make-believe,\r\nseems to partake of the character of the \"laugh of escape.\" It is\r\ncaused by a sense of relief when we recognise that the disaster is not\r\nreal. We laugh at the \"unreal\" when we should be filled with horror\r\nand grief were we assured that there was real pain and cruelty going\r\non in front of us. The laughter caused by grotesque mimicry or\r\ncaricature of pompous or solemn individuals seems to arise from the\r\nsame (more or less unconscious) working of the mind as that caused by\r\nsome unexpected neglect of those social \"taboos\" or laws of behaviour\r\nwhich we call modesty, decency, and propriety. They either cause\r\nindignation and resentment in the onlooker at the neglect of respect\r\nfor the taboo, or, on the contrary, the natural man, long oppressed by\r\npomposity or by the fetters of propriety imposed by society, suddenly\r\nfeels a joyous sense of escape from his bonds, and bursts into\r\nlaughter--the laughter of a return to vitality and nature--which is\r\nenormously encouraged and developed into \"roars of merriment\" by the\r\nsympathy of others around him who are experiencing the same emotion\r\nand expressing it in the same way.\r\n\r\nThe laugh of derision and contempt and the laugh of exultation and\r\ntriumph are of a different character. I cannot now discuss them\r\nfurther than to say that they are either genuine or pretended\r\nassertions of joy in one's own superior vitality or other superiority.\r\nThe \"sardonic smile\" and \"sardonic laughter\" have been supposed by\r\nsome learned men to refer to the smiles of the ancient Sardinians when\r\nstoning their aged parents. But they have no more to do with\r\nSardinians than they have with sardines or sardonyx. The word\r\n\"sardonic\" is related to a Greek word which means \"to snarl,\" and a\r\nsardonic grin is merely a snarl. In it the teeth are shown with\r\nmalicious intent, and not as they are in the benevolent appeal of true\r\nlaughter. Mrs. Grote, the wife of the great historian (who was\r\nherself declared by a French wit to furnish the explanation of the\r\nword \"grotesque\"), wrote of \"Owen's sugar-of-lead smile\"--referring to\r\nthe great naturalist, Richard Owen. There was no malice in the\r\ndescription, for he had, as some others have, a very sweet smile,\r\naccompanied by a strangely grave and disapproving glare in his large\r\nblue prominent eyes. It was only apparently sugar of lead; really, it\r\nwas sugar of milk--the milk of human kindness. The smile of the lost\r\npicture called \"La Gioconda\" is by fanciful people regarded as\r\nsomething very wonderful. It is really the clever portraiture of the\r\nhabitual \"leer\" of a somewhat wearied sensual woman. It had a\r\nfascination for the great Leonardo, but no profound significance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nFATHERLESS FROGS\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting discoveries of recent date in\r\nregard to the processes which go on in that all-important\r\nmaterial--protoplasm--which is the physical basis of life and the\r\nessential constituent of \"cells\"--those minute corpuscles of which all\r\nliving bodies are built--was made in 1910 by a French naturalist, M.\r\nBataillon, and has been examined and confirmed by another French\r\nbiologist, M. Henneguy. To explain this discovery, a few words as to\r\nwell-known facts are necessary. It is well known that if we isolate a\r\nfemale frog at the egg-laying season and let her swim in perfectly\r\npure filtered water, and proceed to deposit some of her eggs in that\r\nwater, the eggs will not germinate; they remain unchanged for a time\r\nand then decompose--become, in fact, \"rotten.\" It is a matter of\r\ncommon knowledge that it is necessary for the eggs to be \"fertilised\"\r\nin order that they may start on that series of changes and growth\r\nwhich we call \"development,\" and become tadpoles and eventually young\r\nfrogs. The \"fertilisation\" of the frog's eggs is effected in ordinary\r\nconditions by the presence in the water of the pond, into which the\r\nfemale sheds them, of microscopic sperm-filaments (often called\r\nspermatozoa, or simply \"sperms\") which are shed into the water at the\r\nsame time by the male frog.\r\n\r\nThe egg (the blackish-brown spherical body, as big as a rape-seed,\r\nwhich is imbedded in a thin jelly, and is familiar to those who are\r\ndrawn by curiosity to look into the waters of wayside ponds in spring)\r\nis a single cell or corpuscle of protoplasm distended with\r\ndark-coloured and other granules of nutrient substance. A single sperm\r\n(though requiring the microscope to render it visible) is also a\r\nsingle cell. It is a minute oval body, with a long serpentine tail of\r\nactively undulating protoplasm. Hundreds of thousands of these are\r\nshed into the water at the breeding season by the male frog. One is\r\nenough to fertilise the egg. The sperm-cells swim in the water, and\r\nare chemically attracted by the eggs. As there are so many sperms, one\r\nof them is sure to reach each black egg-sphere. It drives its way into\r\nthe substance of the egg, making a minute hole in its surface; then\r\nthe protoplasm of the sperm fuses with the protoplasm of the egg, and\r\nbecomes intimately mixed with it. The egg-cell has a \"nucleus,\" that\r\ndense, peculiar, deep-lying, and well-marked \"kernel\" of its\r\nprotoplasm which all cells have. It is of essential importance in the\r\nlife and activity of the cell. The sperm-cell has also a \"nucleus,\"\r\nand now (as has been carefully ascertained) the nucleus of the sperm\r\nand the nucleus of the egg-cell unite and form one single nucleus. The\r\negg is thereupon said to be \"fertilised\"--that is to say, \"rendered\r\nfertile.\" It at once commences to move. Its surface ripples and\r\ncontracts and nips in deeply, so that the sphere is marked out into\r\ntwo hemispheres. These are two \"cells,\" or masses of protoplasm,\r\nadhering to each other. Each is provided with its own distinct nucleus\r\nor cell-kernel, for the first step in the division of the egg-sphere\r\nis the division within it of its newly constituted nucleus into two,\r\neach half consisting of nearly equal proportions of the mingled\r\nsubstance of the sperm-nucleus and the egg-nucleus. The two first\r\ncells or hemispheres again divide, and so the process goes on until\r\nthe little black egg has the appearance of a mulberry, each granule of\r\nthe berry being a cell provided with its own nucleus derived from the\r\noriginal nucleus formed by the fusion of the nuclei of the paternal\r\nand maternal cells. In the course of a day or two the division has\r\nproceeded so far that the resulting \"cells\" are so small as to be\r\ninvisible with a hand-glass, and require one to use a high magnifying\r\npower in order to distinguish them. And there are hundreds of them;\r\nthe whole mass of the \"egg\" within, as well as on the surface, has\r\ndivided into separate cells. They go on multiplying, take up water,\r\nand nourish themselves on the granular nutritive matter present from\r\nthe first in the egg-cell. The little mass elongates, increases in\r\nsize, and gradually assumes the form of a young tadpole.\r\n\r\nWe see, then that the process of fertilisation consists in two things,\r\nthe latter of which necessitates the former, viz. in the breaking or\r\npenetration of the surface of the egg-cell by the active sperm\r\nfilament and second in the fusion of the substance of the sperm\r\nfilament with that of the egg in such a way that there is a distinct\r\nand intimate fusion of the nucleus of the sperm filament with the\r\nnucleus of the egg-cell. The recent discovery of M. Bataillon is this,\r\nviz. that you can make the frog's egg develop in a perfectly regular\r\nway and become a tadpole and then a young frog without the admission\r\nto it of a sperm-filament or of any substance derived from the male\r\nfrog. All you have to do--and the operation, though it sounds easy and\r\nsimple, is an exceedingly delicate and difficult one--is to prick with\r\na fine needle the surface of the little black egg-sphere (not merely\r\nof the jelly surrounding it) when it is shed by the female frog into\r\nperfectly pure water free from sperms or anything of the sort. The\r\nslight artificial puncture acts as does the natural puncture by the\r\nswimming sperm-filament, and is sufficient! The egg proceeds to\r\ndevelop quite regularly. There is no fusion of the nucleus of the\r\negg-cell with any matter from the outside; no paternal \"material\" is\r\nintroduced, but the nucleus of the egg-cell divides just as though\r\nthere had been! The whole progeny of cells, successively formed, are\r\nthe pure offspring of the maternal egg-cell and its nucleus. The\r\ntadpoles and young frogs so produced are examples of what is called\r\n\"parthenogenesis\"--that is to say, virginal reproduction--reproduction\r\nwithout fertilisation by material derived from a male parent! The\r\nneedle, which gives off no material, but simply makes a tiny break in\r\nthe surface of the egg, does all that is necessary!\r\n\r\nTo those not acquainted with all that has been ascertained as to the\r\nreproduction of lower animals such as insects, crustaceans, and worms,\r\nthis discovery will appear more astonishing than it really is. We\r\nknow of many lower animals in which the egg-cells produced by the\r\nfemales do regularly and naturally develop without the intervention of\r\na male and without fertilisation. In an earlier volume[7] of this\r\n\"Easy Chair Series\" I wrote of this curious subject, and described the\r\nvirgin reproduction or parthenogenesis of the hop-louse and\r\nother plant lice, of some moths, of some fresh-water shrimps,\r\nand of the queen bee (who produces only drones by eggs which are\r\nnot fertilised). But I had to point out then that no case was known of\r\n\"parthenogenesis\"--that is to say, reproduction by unfertilised\r\neggs--among the whole series of vertebrate animals, the fishes,\r\namphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. The chief point of novelty\r\nin M. Bataillon's discovery is that we have now an experimental\r\ndemonstration of parthenogenesis in a vertebrate animal, and in one so\r\nhighly organised as the frog. And equally interesting, indeed more\r\nimportant from the point of view as to the real meaning and nature of\r\nfertilisation, is the mode in which the parthenogenesis of the frog is\r\nset going, namely, by a mere prick of the surface film of the ripe\r\negg!\r\n\r\nThere have, however, been important experiments on the subject of the\r\ndevelopment of eggs without fertilisation in recent years, prior to\r\nthese discoveries as to the frog's egg. A favourite subject for such\r\ninquiries is the sea urchin (Echinus of different kinds). The female\r\nsea urchin, or sea egg, like its close allies the star fishes, lays a\r\ngreat number of very transparent minute eggs (each about the 1/200th\r\nof an inch in diameter) in sea-water, and they are there fertilised by\r\nthe mobile sperm filaments discharged by the males. The eggs are so\r\ntransparent and so easily kept alive in jars of sea-water that there\r\nis no difficulty in watching under the microscope the penetration of\r\nthe egg by a sperm, and the fusion and other changes in the nuclei.\r\nDelages of Paris, and Loeb of California, have made valuable studies\r\non these eggs. Loeb has shown that they may be artificially\r\nstarted on the course of development and cell division without\r\nfertilisation--simply by the action of minute quantities of simple\r\nchemicals (fatty acids, etc.) introduced into the sea-water by the\r\nexperimenter. These chemicals appear to act on the delicate pellicle\r\nwhich forms the surface of the egg-cell in much the same way as the\r\nprick of a needle acts on a frog's egg. A limited and delicately\r\nadjusted disturbance of the cohesion (or of the surface-tension) of\r\nthe egg-cell seems to be all that is necessary for starting the\r\negg-cell on its career of development. It becomes, in the light of\r\nthese experiments, not so much a wonder that egg-cells should develop\r\n\"on their own,\" but that they do not more frequently do so. It must be\r\nremembered that the \"germination\" and development of unfertilised\r\neggs, even when the whole range of animals and plants is taken into\r\naccount (for plants also are reproduced by single cells identical in\r\ncharacter with the egg-cells and sperm-cells of animals), that is to\r\nsay, the existence of \"parthenogenesis\" as a natural, regularly\r\nrecurring process, is exceptional. We must distinguish cases in which\r\nit regularly occurs as part of the life-history of an animal or plant\r\nfrom cases in which it has been successfully brought about by\r\nexperimental \"artificial\" methods designed by man. The plant-lice\r\n\"naturally\" reproduce through the summer by unfertilised eggs\r\nproducing only females, but in the first cold of autumn males are\r\nhatched from some of the eggs, and the eggs of this generation are\r\nfertilised and bide through the winter, hatching in the following\r\nspring. Some few moths and flies also reproduce naturally during\r\nsummer by unfertilised eggs, and the brine-shrimps and some other\r\nfresh-water shrimps produce \"fatherless\" broods from their eggs,\r\nsometimes for years in succession, until \"one fine day\" some males are\r\nhatched, owing to what causes we do not know. The queen bee naturally\r\nand regularly lays a certain number of unfertilised eggs, and these\r\nproduce, not females as do the unfertilised eggs of plant-lice, etc.,\r\nbut male bees--the drones--and it is only from such eggs that the\r\ndrones of bees are born. These are the chief cases of regular and\r\nnatural parthenogenesis, but there are others which might be\r\nenumerated.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, examples of artificially induced development of\r\neggs, not fertilised, are very few. The first known came accidentally\r\nto notice. Female silkworm moths reared in confinement sometimes lay\r\neggs when kept apart from the male, and these have been found to\r\nhatch, and give rise to caterpillars, which were not reared to\r\nmaturity. Other moths bred by collectors behaved in the same way, but\r\nthe grubs were reared to maturity, and three successive generations of\r\n\"fatherless\" moths were obtained. In these cases the hatching of\r\nunfertilised eggs is not known to occur in a state of nature, although\r\nit probably occurs occasionally. It has also been observed--an\r\nimportant fact when considered with the history of the frog's egg and\r\nthe needle--that \"brushing\" the unfertilised eggs of the silkworm and\r\nother moths, that is to say, gently polishing the little egg-shells\r\nwith a soft camel's-hair brush, has the effect of starting\r\ndevelopment. Taking two lots of unfertilised eggs adhering to slips of\r\npaper, as laid by the mother moth, it is found that those gently\r\nbrushed will hatch, whilst those not brushed will either not hatch at\r\nall, or in very small number. The brushing seems to disturb the\r\nequilibrium of the protoplasmic egg-cell within the egg-shell just\r\nsufficiently to set it going--going on its course of division and\r\ndevelopment. The only other case of \"artificially-induced\r\nparthenogenesis\" at present recorded is that of the common frog, due\r\nto M. Bataillon. There are questions of great interest still to be\r\nmade out as the result of his discovery. Can the fatherless brood be\r\nreared to maturity and again made to yield a fatherless generation?\r\nWhat is the precise structure of the nuclei of the cells which\r\noriginate from the nucleus of the egg-cell only, and not from a\r\nnucleus formed by the fusion of that with a sperm-cell nucleus? These\r\nand similar questions are the motive of further careful study now in\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nThe important conclusion is forced upon us by these experiments with a\r\nneedle, that even in so typical and highly organised a creature as one\r\nof the higher or five-fingered, air-breathing vertebrates, the\r\negg-cell does not require any material admixture from the sperm-cell\r\nin order that it may successfully germinate and develop, but only a\r\ndisturbance of equilibrium, which can be administered as well by a\r\nneedle's point as by a sperm-filament! Yet the whole process of sexual\r\nreproduction undoubtedly has, as its origin and explanation, the\r\nfusion in the first cell of the new generation from which all the rest\r\nwill arise, of the material of two distinct individuals. Thus the\r\nqualities of the young are not a repetition of the qualities of one\r\nparent, nor are they a mere mixture of the qualities of both parents\r\n(for contradictory qualities cannot mix). They are a new grouping of\r\nqualities comprising some of the one parent and some of the other and\r\nhence a great opportunity for variation, for departure from either\r\nparent's exact \"make-up,\" is afforded, and for the selection and\r\nsurvival of the new combination. It is, it would seem, only in\r\nexceptional cases and for limited periods that uni-sexual or\r\nfatherless reproduction can be advantageous to a species of plant or\r\nanimal. Such cases are those in which abundant food, present for a\r\nlimited season, renders the most rapid multiplication of individuals\r\nan advantage to the species. But after this exceptional abundance has\r\ncome to an end, the more usual process of reproduction by fertilised\r\neggs (also necessary and advantageous for the preservation of the race\r\nby \"natural selection in the struggle for existence\" of the new\r\nvarieties so produced) is resumed until again the abundant food is\r\npresent, as in the annual history of plant lice and the plants on\r\nwhich they feed.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: \"Science from an Easy Chair,\" Methuen & Co., 1910.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nPRIMITIVE BELIEFS ABOUT FATHERLESS PROGENY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapter I related the curious and exceptional cases\r\nof \"fatherless reproduction\" by means of true egg-cells, those cells\r\nof special nature produced in the organs called \"ovaries,\" present in\r\nall but the simplest animals and plants. These egg-cells are usually,\r\nwith elaborate sureness and precise mechanism after liberation from\r\nthe ovary, fertilised by (that is to say, fused with) the complemental\r\nreproductive cells--the sperm-filaments--produced by other\r\nindividuals, the males.\r\n\r\nBut we must not forget--and, indeed, one should not enter on the\r\nconsideration of this subject without a knowledge of the fact--that\r\nvast numbers of animals and plants reproduce themselves \"asexually,\"\r\nas it is termed, namely, by breaking-off or separating buds, branches,\r\nor other good solid bits of their structure which, when thus\r\nseparated, are capable of individual life and growth. Thus plants very\r\nlargely multiply, using this method in addition to the sexual method\r\nof egg-cells and sperm-cells. One may take \"cuttings\" from plants and\r\nrear them, and plants also \"cut\" or detach such bits themselves, in\r\nthe form of runners, of dividing bulbs, of bulbules, and such\r\nreproductive growths seen on the lily, on the viviparous, alpine\r\ngrass, and many other plants. Even a bit cut off from the leaf of a\r\nplant (for instance, a begonia) will sprout, root itself, and grow\r\ninto a completely formed and healthy individual. Animals, too, such as\r\npolyps or zoophytes, and many beautiful and elaborate worms, multiply\r\nby \"fission,\" dividing into two or more parts, each of which becomes a\r\ncomplete animal. This process is not seen in any fish, amphibian,\r\nreptile, bird, or mammal, nor in molluscs, nor in insects,\r\ncrustaceans, myriapods, and arachnids (spiders and scorpions). It is\r\nalmost wholly confined to lower animals (worms and polyps) and to\r\nplants, and hence is often called \"vegetative reproduction.\" The most\r\nremarkable case of its appearance among higher forms is that of the\r\nmarine Ascidians, or tunicates--close allies of the true\r\nvertebrates--where reproduction by budding and the formation of\r\nwonderfully elaborate star-like forms produced by budding and the\r\ncohesion of the budded individuals as one composite individual are\r\nwell known. Their beautiful shapes and colours have been reproduced in\r\nhundreds of exquisite pictures by our great artist-naturalists. We\r\nthus have to recognise that there are two distinct kinds of\r\nreproduction in living things. One is \"asexual,\" by means of division\r\nor separation of large or special masses of their existence, made up\r\nof ordinary tissue cells. Co-existing with this, often in the same\r\nindividuals, is the other method, the \"sexual,\" by means of detached\r\negg-cells and sperm-cells which are thrown off from the parents, and\r\ndo not (except in rare instances) proceed to develop unless the\r\negg-cell is \"fertilised\" by the fusion with it of a sperm-cell.\r\n\r\nThe whole subject of the reproduction of animals and plants was, until\r\nthe introduction of the microscope, involved in obscurity and mystery.\r\nThe Greeks and Romans had necessarily very imperfect and erroneous\r\nnotions on the subject, and it was not until 300 years ago that\r\nWilliam Harvey, the discoverer of the circulation of the blood,\r\ndeclared, as a general law, that every living thing is born from an\r\negg. During that 300 years his conclusion has been examined and\r\nmodified, corrected and expanded, and the microscope has at last\r\nenabled us to see and follow the excessively minute particles and\r\nstructures by which sexual reproduction is effected. Harvey's dictum\r\nwas a step in advance when it was made, for previously the belief was\r\ncurrent that living things were \"bred\" in all sorts of queer ways. It\r\nwas supposed that the putrefying flesh of a dead animal actually was\r\nconverted by a sudden process into maggots, and that rotten wood\r\nwould breed, out of its own substance, ships' barnacles and even young\r\ngeese and mice--an opinion contested only 200 years ago by Sir Thomas\r\nBrowne! No difficulty was felt in admitting that whole swarms of\r\ninsects, fishes, and even herds of larger beasts were spontaneously\r\ngenerated from mud, from putrid matter, or from the waters of the sea.\r\nThat, indeed, was the popular notion set forth by the poet, John\r\nMilton, as to the mode in which living things were \"miraculously\"\r\nbrought into existence at the beginning of things by the \"fiat\" of the\r\nCreator. What more probable than that such a creation should still be,\r\nhere and there, at work? However, not three centuries ago, actual\r\nexperiment gradually convinced the learned that maggots are bred in a\r\ndead body only from the eggs laid by parent flies, as shown by the\r\nItalian Redi in 1668 who found that no maggots were bred when he\r\nsimply excluded the flies from access to the dead body by covering it\r\nwith wire gauze, but that the blow-flies swarmed on the gauze and\r\nvainly laid their eggs on it! It was only gradually recognised that\r\nbirth by means of eggs or germs extruded from parental organisms of\r\nthe same history and character as their offspring is the explanation\r\nof all such swarms of flies, worms, and even mushrooms and moulds as\r\nhad been formerly ascribed to a mysterious power of breeding these\r\norganisms possessed by inanimate dirt and refuse.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this progress in knowledge the belief in \"spontaneous\r\ngeneration\" of such excessively minute organisms as the bacteria and\r\nyeasts was general until Theodore Schwann in 1836 performed with them\r\njust the same experiment as Redi had performed with blow-flies in\r\n1668. He showed that if a putrescible liquid (for instance, soup) were\r\nboiled in a retort so as to destroy all germs, and then the open neck\r\nof the retort was kept heated in a flame, so that no floating germs\r\ncould enter alive, the soup did not putrefy, and no bacteria or other\r\norganisms appeared in it. The old notions, nevertheless, survive to\r\nthis day. Peasants, fisher-folk, and even uneducated wealthy\r\ncountrymen cling to them with the confidence arising from profound\r\nignorance. And occasionally a man of some scientific training and\r\nknowledge astonishes the world by a futile attempt to show that the\r\nold fancies were true in regard, at any rate, to the lowest\r\nmicroscopic forms of life. But these are but the echoes of the past;\r\nwe do not believe nowadays in \"spontaneous generation,\" nor in sudden\r\ntransformations of lower into higher forms of life. The doctrine,\r\n\"_omne vivum e vivo_\"--every living thing (in the present condition of\r\nour earth) is born from a living thing--is now held by scientific\r\ninvestigators as a reasonable generalisation of experience.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Harvey's dictum, \"Every living thing comes from an\r\negg,\" is only true in a limited sense, namely, that whilst the\r\nindividual among most larger animals and plants is always traceable to\r\nan egg-cell detached from a parental individual of a like kind of\r\nspecies, there are whole groups and series of lower animals and most\r\nplants in which the individual born or \"developed\" from an egg-cell\r\ndoes not proceed when grown to full size to reproduce in turn by eggs\r\nand fertilising sperms, but divides into two or more individuals or\r\ngives off detached buds or reproductive bulbs, which become separate\r\nindividuals, and only after these and several successive generations\r\nof individuals have been thus produced \"asexually,\" by fission or by\r\nbudding, does a generation appear which produces true egg-cells and\r\nsperm-cells and reproduces by their means. Thus it is true that the\r\nindividuals \"budded off\" or separated by fission from an asexual\r\nparent can be ultimately traced through one or more generations of\r\nprevious asexual parents to an egg-cell produced and fertilised in the\r\nregular way, and with this important modification Harvey's dictum is\r\njustified. These facts and the wonderful histories of the animals and\r\nplants in which egg-and-sperm-producing generations \"alternate\" with\r\ngenerations which multiply by fission and budding have only been\r\nworked out in detail and by the aid of the microscope during the great\r\ncentury of scientific discovery which lies just behind us. Often the\r\ntwo generations, reproducing, the one by fission, the other by egg and\r\nsperm-cells, are alike in appearance, but often they are very\r\ndifferent, and have naturally been supposed at first to have nothing\r\nto do with each other.\r\n\r\nThus some of the little \"coralline polyps\" and other most beautiful\r\nlittle marine flower-like polyps attached to rocks, weeds, and shells\r\nin the sea reproduce by budding and division. But after a period of\r\nsuch growth and such budding they produce on their stalks--jelly-fish!\r\nThese jelly-fish are budded and thrown off by them, as glass-like\r\nswimming bells, which lead an independent life, seize prey, nourish\r\nthemselves, and grow to a size varying from that of a sixpence to that\r\nof a cart-wheel. These \"bells\" are commonly known as \"jelly-fish.\"\r\nThey discharge thousands of egg-cells into the sea and fertilise them\r\nwith sperms! From those fertilised eggs grow young polyps, which fix\r\nthemselves to rocks or weeds, and grow up to bud and multiply by\r\nfission, and eventually to produce again by fission a generation of\r\njelly-fishes! Such a marvellous history of alternating modes of\r\nreproduction has been discovered, and described in greatest\r\nmicroscopic detail and with most ample pictorial representations of\r\nall the minutest structures of the organisms studied, not only in many\r\nmarine polyps, but also in the case of many parasitic worms, such as\r\nthe tape worms and the liver-flukes. Some of the most fascinating\r\ncases, on account of the beauty of the little creatures concerned, are\r\nfound amongst the surface-swimming Ascidians of the sea--the\r\nglass-like Salps. But our common ferns and mosses also show this same\r\nalternation of sexual and sexless generations, the two generations\r\ndiffering greatly in size, form, and structure from one another,\r\nwhilst the whole story of \"flowers\" and their structure is bound up\r\nwith a wonderful \"telescoping\" or rolling of the two generations\r\n(sexless and sexual) into one plant!\r\n\r\nIt was not until long after Harvey's time that these things were\r\nunderstood, and there was every excuse--in the absence of observation\r\nof the facts, especially those yet to be revealed by the\r\nmicroscope--for the erroneous suppositions and explanations which were\r\nformerly entertained as to the mode of reproduction of the less\r\nfamiliar plants and animals. If we go back to the starting-point of\r\nEuropean science, to the great Aristotle, we find that he had formed\r\nsingularly correct conclusions as to the reproduction of the larger\r\nkinds of animals, though he knew nothing about \"sperms,\" having no\r\nmicroscope, and only regarded the fluid produced by male animals as\r\nexercising a fertilising effect on the eggs, which in many instances\r\nare large enough for anyone to see. But, of course, he could not have\r\nany knowledge of the egg-cell, nor does he say anything about the\r\nreproduction of plants. Later, however, the sexuality of flowering\r\nplants was taught by his pupils, and at the time of the Roman Empire\r\nthere was a very definite belief among learned men (such as Pliny)\r\nthat the larger plants and animals reproduce by eggs or by seeds\r\nproduced by the females which require to be \"fertilised\" by a product\r\nformed in the males--the spermatic fluid in the case of animals and by\r\nthe pollen in the case of a few flowering plants (_e.g._ the\r\ndate-palm). But there was no idea of holding this as a general and\r\nuniversal law. From Pliny to Harvey and later, those who concerned\r\nthemselves with natural history accepted without difficulty any\r\nstrange accounts or appearances as to the reproduction or the sudden\r\nproduction in fanciful and astonishing ways of the lower and smaller\r\nanimals and plants. They did not expect these inferior creatures to\r\nhave the same methods of reproduction as the higher and bigger\r\ncreatures. It is only now, since the later years of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, that we are able to show that all animals and plants, even\r\nthe minutest microscopic kinds, reproduce by the formation and\r\nseparation of egg-cells, and that these egg-cells are (in all but a\r\nfew exceptional cases) fertilised by sperm cells, which are smaller\r\nthan the egg-cells, and usually provided with active swimming\r\nfilaments.\r\n\r\nNot only did our mediæval ancestors believe all sorts of fancies as to\r\nthe propagation of lower animals and plants, but they were quite\r\nprepared to accept stories as to reproduction in the case of higher\r\nanimals, and even in mankind, by irregular methods, such as\r\nparthenogenesis, or the defect of an ordinary male parent. In the\r\nMiddle Ages in Europe, and earlier in the East, the belief in the\r\nfrequent occurrence of the birth of a child which had no human male\r\nparent was common. It was, so to speak, an admitted though irregular\r\noccurrence. A very curious thing is that when such cases were supposed\r\nto occur, they were not ascribed to any natural process such as we now\r\nrecognise in the \"parthenogenesis\" of insects and crustaceans, but to\r\nthe visitation of the mother by a spirit--a floating, volatile demon\r\nor angel (known as an \"incubus\" in the Middle Ages) beneficent or\r\nmalicious as the case might be. Stories of the nocturnal visits of\r\nthese mysterious ghostly \"incubi\" are on record in great number and\r\nvariety, both in European and Oriental tradition and legend. There\r\nseems to have been a readiness to believe the theory of paternity from\r\namong the hidden world of goblins, fairies, and sprites which was very\r\nnaturally made use of by a woman and her relatives when she could not\r\nproduce the father of her child.\r\n\r\nWe come across examples of such beliefs in invisible agents of\r\npaternity even among the more cultivated Romans. Thus Virgil in his\r\n\"Georgics\" cites as a fact that mares are fertilised by the wind. His\r\nwords are given on the next page.\r\n\r\nIt is now known that, quite apart from any motive of concealment of\r\nthe true paternity of their offspring, some of the native tribes of\r\nAustralia have the belief that, as the regular and normal thing,\r\nchildren are begotten by strange fairy-like spirits which haunt the\r\nrocks and trees of certain localities and enter the future mother as\r\nshe passes by these haunted rocks and trees. These Australian \"black\r\nfellows\" hold that the human father counts for nothing in the matter.\r\nThe belief of these Australian savages is referred to by writers on\r\nthe subject (Mr. Andrew Lang and others) as \"the spiritual theory of\r\nconception.\" There are some reasons for thinking that this curious\r\ntheory and the accompanying ignorance as to the natural causes of\r\nconception were widely spread among primeval men. The fact that most\r\ntrees are fertilised by the wind (which carries to their female\r\nflowers the invisible powder, or pollen, of the male flowers,\r\nconveyed in the case of smaller plants which have gay-coloured flowers\r\nby bees and butterflies) may have been noticed by primitive man, and\r\nhave started the belief that there are fertilising spirits or demons\r\nin the air. However the fancy arose, it is only a parallel to the\r\nstrange fancies as to spontaneous generation of all sorts of animals\r\nand plants current 200 years ago among civilised men. And, further, it\r\nis worth noting that the uncanny belief in the \"incubus\" which was\r\ngenerally prevalent in the Middle Ages may possibly be considered as a\r\nsurvival in (or incursion into) Europe of the primitive spiritual\r\ntheory of all human conception, and of the fertilising activity of the\r\nhaunting spirits of the air which was held by primeval man, and is\r\nstill found in full force among the Arunta tribes of Australia.\r\n\r\n    \"Ore omnes versæ in Zephyrum stant rupibus altis\r\n    Exceptantque leves auras et sæpe sine ullis\r\n    Conjugiis vento gravidæ, mirabile dictu.\"\r\n\r\n    Georgic iii. 275.\r\n\r\n    (Facing the west on lofty rocks\r\n    All stand and sniff the buoyant breeze\r\n    And often--marvellous to tell--\r\n    Without conjunction with a sire,\r\n    Bear young engendered by the wind.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE PYGMY RACES OF MEN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tradition of the existence of dwarfs, not as isolated examples,\r\nbut as a race with their own customs, government, and language is\r\nfamiliar among civilised people, and exists among scattered and remote\r\nsavages. We have all heard of them in that treasury of primitive\r\nbeliefs--the nursery. Therefore, the fact that there are at this\r\nmoment in various parts of the world dwarf or pygmy tribes of men,\r\nliving in proximity to but apart from those races which have a stature\r\nidentical with our own, has a great fascination and interest. Some few\r\nraces of men have an average height of an inch, or thereabouts,\r\ngreater than that of the people of the British Islands, whilst some\r\nare shorter by as much as two or three inches. But, on the whole, it\r\nmay be said that, putting aside the pygmy races, of which I am about\r\nto write, mankind generally does not show a very striking range of\r\nnormal stature--the mass in any race or region of the globe varying\r\nfrom 5 ft. 4 in. to 5 ft. 8 in., and tending to the higher rather than\r\nthe lower figure.\r\n\r\nThe pygmy races are sharply separated from normal mankind by as much\r\nas a foot, and even more, in average stature, ranging from 4 ft. to\r\nsomething less than 4 ft. 11 in. in height. They are, enumerating them\r\nin the order of their purity of race and completeness of their\r\nisolation: (1) The Mincopies, or Andaman Islanders; (2) the Congo\r\npygmies (comprising the tribes known as the Akkas, or Tiki-Tikis, the\r\nBambutis, the Watwas, the Obongos, and Bayagas); (3) the bushmen of\r\nSouth Africa; (4) the Aetas of the Philippine Islands; (5) the Samangs\r\nof Malacca, and very similar isolated pygmy tribes which have been\r\nobserved in New Guinea, and also in the Solomon Islands and in\r\nFormosa. The Veddas of Ceylon, the Senois of Malacca, and the Toalas\r\nof Celebes are apparently races which have resulted from the\r\n\"crossing\" of true pygmies with other normal-statured races inhabiting\r\nthe islands in which they are found. The Brahouis of Beloochistan and\r\nthe \"monkey-men,\" or Bandra-Loks, east of the Indus, appear also to\r\nbelong to the pygmy race.\r\n\r\nNext to their agreement in small size, the most interesting facts\r\nabout the pygmies we have just enumerated is that, notwithstanding the\r\nwide area over which they are found in scattered, isolated\r\ncommunities--viz. from the Congo to South Africa on the one hand, and,\r\non the other hand, from Central Africa to the Indian Ocean, and on to\r\nNew Guinea, the Philippine Islands, and Formosa--yet they all have\r\nshort, round skulls of full average brain capacity, and have their\r\nhair growing in tightly curled-up peppercorn-like tufts--two\r\ncharacters found combined in no other race. They usually have\r\nfinely-developed, straight foreheads, and the jaws do not project\r\nstrongly; the lips are usually fine and thin, and the nose, though\r\nvery broad, is not always greatly flattened. They are well-shaped,\r\nwell-proportioned little people, neither grotesque nor deformed. To a\r\ngreat extent their corporeal features suggest an infantile or\r\nchild-like stage of development, and the same is true of their\r\nintellectual condition and of their productions. Their habitations are\r\nvery primitive, either caves or low clay-made huts, of the shape of\r\nhalf an egg. They do not make pottery, and neither keep herds nor till\r\nthe ground, contenting themselves with such food as wild fruits and\r\nroots and the animals they kill with spear or arrow or capture in\r\ntraps. They do not mutilate or bedaub their bodies (though the\r\nAndamanese indulge in a kind of \"tattooing\"). Among them the struggle\r\nfor life does not exist in its more brutal forms. They take care of\r\nthe sick and feeble, the children, and the old people. Cannibalism is\r\nunknown amongst them; they punish murder and theft. They are honest,\r\nand, moreover, are monogamous, and punish adultery, which is rare\r\namong them. Their religion is remarkably simple. It is limited to\r\nreverence for a Supreme Being, without any offering of sacrifice, and\r\nthey do not worship ancestors nor exhibit the superstitions known as\r\n\"animism.\" It has been argued that these characteristics, taken\r\ntogether, indicate a primitive condition of humanity. On the other\r\nhand, many writers regard them as degenerate offshoots of negro-like\r\nraces of larger stature and more complicated mental development.\r\n\r\nThere is no name by which the whole series of these small-sized people\r\nis indicated excepting the ancient designation of \"pygmies.\" Many\r\ncareful students of human races separate the pygmies of Africa as\r\n\"negrilloes\" from the pygmies of Asia, whom they designate\r\n\"negritoes,\" and it is held that the negrilloes (Congo pygmies and\r\nbushmen) hold the same relation to African negroes and Zulus as the\r\nnegritoes (Andamanese, and scattered tribes in New Guinea, the\r\nPhilippines, Formosa and the Solomon Islands, as well as in Malacca\r\nand Annam and in the north-west and in other parts of Hindustan) hold\r\nto the full-sized, frizzly haired Papuans. This, no doubt, is a\r\nconvenient way of stating the case, but the important fact remains\r\nthat the pygmies of purest race, both of Africa and Asia, have the\r\nremarkable characteristics in common which we have noted above. Their\r\nbodily and mental peculiarities certainly suggest, whether the\r\nsuggestion can be verified or not, the former existence in the\r\ntropical regions of Africa and Asia of a widely spread pygmy race of\r\nuniform character, a race which has been, to a large extent, destroyed\r\nby other races of larger and more powerful individuals, but has also\r\nin many regions (especially on the Asiatic Continent) intermarried\r\nwith the surrounding larger people, and given rise to hybrid races. At\r\nthe same time, it seems that in other regions this race has, by\r\nisolation in forests and mountain ranges and by the exercise of\r\nspecial skill in the use of poisoned arrows and in the arts of\r\nconcealment, evasion, and terrorising, succeeded in maintaining its\r\nexistence and primitive independence dating from remote prehistoric\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nWhether we regard the pygmies as one race or as the result of local\r\nmodification of larger races, it is noteworthy that they are of\r\nlighter tint than the black races close to or among whom they live.\r\nSome, both of the African and Asiatic pygmies, are very dark\r\nbrown--practically black--but many are of a paler and yellowish tint.\r\nWe must not forget that the babies and quite young children of negroes\r\nare nearly \"white.\" The Asiatic pygmies, notably the Andamanese, are\r\ndarker than their African fellows. It must necessarily be difficult in\r\nstudying such a race to make due allowance not merely for admixture of\r\nblood from surrounding populations, but to estimate correctly what the\r\nlittle people have learnt in the way of art and habit from their\r\nneighbours and what is their own. The Andaman Islanders, though\r\nprovided with metal by trading, still use the sharp-edged splinters of\r\nvolcanic glass-stone to shave their heads, which they keep entirely\r\nbald!\r\n\r\nIt is one of the merits of the showman's enterprise in modern times\r\nthat he brings to a great city like London groups of interesting\r\nsavages, without imposture and without ill-treatment, and enables us\r\nto see and talk with them almost as though we had travelled to their\r\nremote native forests. It would certainly be a successful and worthy\r\nenterprise on the part of the Anthropological Society of London to\r\nstart a garden and houses such as those maintained by the Zoological\r\nSociety, but arranged so as to receive some five or six groups of\r\ninteresting \"savages.\" The society would be responsible for careful\r\nand humane treatment of their guests, and return them after a sojourn,\r\nsay, of a couple years, to their native country and replace them by\r\nspecimens of other races. Under the auspices of showmen I have seen\r\nZulu Kaffirs, Guiana Indians, North American Indians, Kalmuck Tartars,\r\nSouth African bushmen, and Congo pygmies in London, besides many\r\nhundreds of African negroes of various tribes. Farini's bushmen and\r\nHarrison's Congo pygmies were perfect samples of the dwarf race about\r\nwhich I am writing. But I also saw and examined carefully, in 1872, at\r\nNaples, with my friend Professor Panceri, the two African pygmies,\r\nTebo and Chairallah, who were the first to reach Europe. They were\r\nsubsequently adopted by and lived for some years under the care of\r\nCount Miniscalchi Erizzo. They were very intelligent, and learnt to\r\nread and to write well, and to play difficult music on the piano, with\r\nfeeling and appreciation. We were especially concerned to determine by\r\nthe stage of growth of their teeth and other indications whether they\r\nwere merely ordinary young negroes, as some anthropologists supposed,\r\nor really representatives of the dwarf race as asserted by the\r\ntraveller Miani, who bought them, in exchange for a dog and a calf, in\r\nthe country of the Mombootoos, south of the Welle River, and west of\r\nthe Albert Nyanza. They were still young and growing when we examined\r\nthem, but Tebo ceased growth when he had reached a stature of 4 ft. 8\r\nin. We had no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that they were,\r\nwhen we saw them, really of exceptionally small stature for their age\r\nas indicated by the teeth which were in place in their jaws.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.--Copy of a figure from a group drawn on a\r\nGreek vase (dating from 300 B.C.), representing a number of the\r\npygmies of the remote Upper Nile engaged in battle. The resemblance of\r\nthe peaked cap and of the beard to those of the little figures carved\r\nby Black Forest peasants and intended to represent the mythical\r\n\"gnomes\" or dwarf mining-elves is noteworthy. (From Saglio and\r\nDerenberg's \"Dictionnaire des Antiquités Grecs et Romaines.\")]\r\n\r\nThe Akkas living near the sources of the Nile were known to the\r\nancient Egyptians, and were the foundation of stories and fabulous\r\nexaggerations among the ancient Greeks. Even before Homer these\r\nstories existed, and the little people were called \"pygmies,\" which\r\nmeans \"of the length of the forearm\" (Greek, pugmé). Homer refers to\r\nthe wars of these pygmies with the cranes, and as a matter of fact the\r\nAfrican pygmies do wage a kind of war upon the great cranes which\r\nswarm in the marsh-land of their country. Naturally enough the really\r\nsmall size of the African pygmies (they are about 4 ft. in height,\r\nsome two or three inches less, some as much as eight inches more) was\r\nexaggerated by report and tradition, just as the really big eggs of\r\nthe great extinct ostrich-like bird of Madagascar were represented in\r\nthe story of Sindbad, in the \"Arabian Nights,\" as being as large as\r\nthe dome of a temple, and the bird large in proportion. The Egyptians,\r\nas we have seen, knew the pygmy Akkas, and Egyptian fact was ever the\r\nromance of the Greeks.\r\n\r\nHerodotus mentions the African pygmies from beyond the Libyan desert,\r\nciting, as is his wont, the accounts of certain travellers with whom\r\nhe had conversed, and a later Greek writer tells of a pygmy race in\r\nIndia, a statement which our present knowledge confirms. It is a\r\ncurious fact that Swift's Lilliputians are thus traceable to the\r\nCentral African dwarf race, for Greek legend related that Hercules\r\nvisited the country of the pygmies, where on waking from sleep he\r\nfound one division of the army guarding his right leg, another his\r\nleft, and others his arms. Hercules got up, swept them all into the\r\nlion's skin which he used as a cloak, and went on his way, shaking out\r\nhis small tormentors from their prison as though they were so many\r\nants. It seems fairly certain that Swift derived the initial scene in\r\nhis story of Gulliver's adventures among the Lilliputians from this\r\nlegend.\r\n\r\nMiani's pygmies were members of a tribe discovered by the\r\ndistinguished traveller Schweinfurth, who, in 1870, was the first to\r\nvisit the country of the Niam-Niam, to the west of the sources of the\r\nNile, and had the honour of showing that the myths of the ancient\r\nGreeks as to a nation of pygmies were based on fact, and that the\r\ndefinite words of Aristotle as to the existence of these pygmy people\r\non the upper reaches of the Nile were correct. Schweinfurth found to\r\nthe south of the Niam-Niam country a tribe of full-statured negroes\r\ncalled the Mombootoos, whose chief, Moonza, kept close to the Royal\r\nresidence a colony of pygmies who were called in that country by the\r\nname \"Akkas.\" Schweinfurth ascertained that they are spread to the\r\nnumber of many thousands along the borders of the great Congo forest\r\nand form numerous tribes. They are very generally well treated by\r\ntheir more powerful neighbours, as by Moonza. Partly from fear of\r\ntheir poisoned arrows and their crafty methods of attack and\r\nsubsequent disappearance into the forest, partly on account of a\r\nsuperstitious dread of them, the Congo pygmies are not only tolerated,\r\nbut protected, by the larger people. They alone are at home in the\r\nsteaming darkness of the immeasurable forest into which no other\r\nnatives dare to enter.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable fact that the Egyptologist Mariette had, before\r\nthese discoveries, found on an ancient Egyptian monument the portrait\r\nof a dwarf inscribed with the word \"akka\"--the identical name by which\r\nthey are known at this day in the region where Schweinfurth found\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nPublic interest in the pygmy race was rearoused three years ago by the\r\nannouncement that the party of English naturalists at that time\r\nexploring the interior of New Guinea had come across a tribe of these\r\nlittle people in the mountains of that island. The existence of these\r\npygmies in New Guinea was already well known, but fuller accounts of\r\nthem will be valuable. The Italian traveller Beccari, in 1876, speaks\r\nof them as \"Karonis,\" and states that they occupy a chain of mountains\r\nparallel to the north coast of the north-west peninsular of the\r\nisland. D'Albertis, Lawes, and other travellers have seen and\r\ndescribed individuals of the pygmy race of the mountains of New\r\nGuinea. It is interesting to find that they are described as having\r\nthe body covered with fine, woolly hair, a feature which is recorded\r\nby Schweinfurth, by Stanley, and by an ancient Greek writer, in regard\r\nto the Congo pygmies of Africa, and led in former times to the notion\r\nthat the old traditions and accounts of African pygmies referred, not\r\nto human beings, but to chimpanzees!\r\n\r\nThe Laplanders are the only very small-sized people in Europe, but\r\nthey run from 5 ft. upwards, whereas the negrites and negrillos run\r\nfrom about 4 ft. to less than 5 ft. The Lapps (of whom there are about\r\n25,000 in Finmark and Lapmark) are a thick-set, round-headed\r\n(brachycephalic), dark-yellow race, and have always been credited with\r\npowers of witchcraft and magic by their neighbours and by modern\r\nsailors. They live in immediate contact with the Finns (both are\r\nMongolian races), who are very tall and have fair hair and blue eyes.\r\nSome writers have supposed that the Lapps are the remnants of a small\r\nrace which was formerly spread over the whole of Europe, and was\r\nexterminated or driven out by the larger races. But we have no\r\nevidence in favour of this view and strong evidence against it, since\r\nwe now know the skulls and skeletons of a great number of the\r\nprehistoric inhabitants of Europe belonging to the Bronze, to the\r\nNeolithic, and to the Palæolithic periods. None of these skeletons\r\nbelong to an abnormally small-sized race, though the Bronze-age people\r\nwere smaller than their predecessors and successors. The cave-dwellers\r\nof the \"reindeer\" epoch of the Palæolithic period were big men, with\r\nfine, high skulls, and even the earlier Palæolithic men of the glacial\r\nperiod, the man of the Neanderthal, the couple from Spy, and the three\r\nrecently dug up near Perigueux (of whom I have written in another\r\nbook),[8] were not diminutive men. It is true they were not tall--only\r\nabout 5 ft. 4 in. in height--but they were very powerful and muscular,\r\nand totally different physically from the Lapps or from any of the\r\ntropical pygmy men. It is a remarkable fact that in one cave at\r\nMentone, on the Riviera, explored by the Prince of Monaco, two\r\nskeletons have been found belonging to a shortish negro-like race\r\n(indicated by the form of the skull), and apparently a little later in\r\ndate than the Neandermen. We must remember that at that remote date\r\nthere was continuous land connection between Europe and Africa. There\r\nis, in fact, no reason to suppose that a pygmy race ever existed in\r\nEurope, though, of course, individuals of exceptionally small stature\r\nare often produced, and in some regions the whole population is\r\nshorter than it is in others.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA very interesting question in connection with the origin and\r\nsignificance of pygmy races of men is, \"Why is any race smaller in\r\nsize than another?\" Every species among the higher animals has its\r\nstandard size from which only in the rarest cases are there\r\ndepartures. That in itself is a curious fact. How was the standard\r\nsize determined, and how is it maintained? The whole question lies\r\nthere. At first sight it seems to many people quite simple to account\r\nfor \"pygmies\"; they will tell you that the poor creatures are\r\nhalf-starved and so unable to grow to full size. That explanation does\r\nnot, however, meet the case, for the African and Asiatic pygmy races\r\nare just as well nourished as most of their neighbours. Also if we\r\nlook a little further we find that the women of every race are smaller\r\nthan the men, and often much smaller. That is not because they are\r\nill-nourished as compared with the men. And, again, we find very\r\nclosely similar species of animals existing side by side, one a large\r\nspecies and the other a small one, having the same opportunities of\r\nobtaining regular nourishment. There are many instances, but take for\r\nexample the beautiful Great Koodoo antelope of Africa, with its fine\r\nspiral horns, which measures 5 ft. at the shoulder, and the Little\r\nKoodoo, a complete miniature of it existing alongside of it, and\r\nstanding only 3 ft. 5 in. at the shoulder. Take the two common white\r\nbutterflies of this country, the Large White and the Small White, also\r\nthe Large Tortoiseshell butterfly and the small. Take the instance of\r\nmany plant genera of which larger and smaller species are found\r\ngrowing side by side. The difference in size in these cases cannot be\r\ntraced to any insufficiency of nutrition in the smaller kind.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that difference of size in animals has some deep-lying\r\ncause, which is not merely the greater or less abundance of food.\r\nNumerous specimens of a perfectly well-formed elephant, closely allied\r\nin structure to the Indian elephant, but only 3 ft. high, are found\r\nfossil in Malta and the neighbouring Mediterranean region, and in\r\nLiberia a species of hippopotamus, distinct from that of other African\r\nregions, is common, which is not bigger than a common pig. Pygmy hogs,\r\npygmy deer, pygmy buffaloes (and many other pygmy animals) are known\r\nas thriving wild species, so that it seems clear that there are other\r\ncauses at work than semi-starvation in the production of pygmy races.\r\n\r\nA second suggestion which is sometimes made is that the smaller race,\r\nor smaller species of two allied forms, is the original one, and that\r\nthe larger forms have developed from these and established themselves,\r\nwithout completely destroying the smaller original race. This view has\r\nat various times been favoured in regard to the pygmy race of man.\r\nThere is something plausible in the view that these little men are\r\nnearer than normal mankind are to the monkeys, and the fur-like\r\nhairiness of their skin has been cited in support of it; but a fatal\r\nobjection is that the men of the pure pygmy race of Africa and Asia\r\nare really not more, but less, monkey-like than many full-sized\r\nsavages. They have heads and faces nearer in shape to those of\r\nEuropeans than have the Australians, the Tasmanians, and the negroes.\r\nThey are more intelligent, shrewd, and skilful than their full-sized\r\nneighbours. It is quite possible that they are a very ancient\r\nrace--more ancient, in their isolation and freedom from complicated\r\ncustoms, habits, and mode of life than other savages--but they are not\r\nprimitive in the sense of being ape-like in structure or in want of\r\nmental capacity.\r\n\r\nA third possibility in regard to the pygmy people is that they have\r\nbeen \"selected\" by natural conditions which favoured the survival of\r\nsmall individuals, and thus established a small race--just as man has\r\nestablished small races of horses, dogs, cattle, or what not, by\r\ncontinually selecting small individuals for breeding, until he has\r\nproduced such races as the Shetland pony, the toy terrier, and the\r\nKerry cow. It is necessary to discover or to suggest (if this\r\nexplanation is to be accepted) what precisely is the advantage, in a\r\nstate of nature, to a small-sized race in being of small size. The\r\nguess is made that the small people can more easily hide, whether in\r\nforest or among the rocks and caves of mountainous regions, from\r\naggressive larger-sized mankind. The objection to this view is that\r\nthough it may explain the present habits and dwelling-places of some\r\nof the pygmy race, it is not capable of explaining their first\r\nsegregation and formation as a distinct race. Another general\r\nadvantage which small animals have over larger ones of the same\r\nspecies is that if the food of the species is widely distributed but\r\nlimited in amount, a hundred individuals weighing 5 st. each will\r\nsecure more of it than fifty individuals weighing 10 st. each. The\r\ntotal weight of individuals is the same, but the smaller series will\r\ncover twice the area and have twice as much opportunity to secure the\r\nlimited amount of food, whilst, in proportion to their size, requiring\r\nless. It cannot be doubted that, other things being equal, this\r\nobvious relation must tend to limit the increase in size of animals\r\nwhich have to search for their special food, and must favour small\r\nraces.\r\n\r\nSome writers have supposed that small limited areas, such as small\r\nislands, favour the production of small races by some mysterious law\r\nof appropriateness similar to that which lays down that \"who drives\r\nfat oxen should himself be fat.\" The pygmy buffalo of the island of\r\nCelebes, the Anoa, is cited as an instance, and the pygmy men of the\r\nAndaman Islands as another. But there are plenty of facts which would\r\nlead to an exactly opposite conclusion. Gigantic tortoises are found\r\nin the Galapagos Islands and in the minute islands of the Indian\r\nOcean, and never on the big continents. Gigantic birds bigger than\r\nostriches abounded in the islands of New Zealand and Madagascar. Some\r\nof the tallest races of men are found in the Pacific islands, whilst\r\nthe tallest European population is that of the north of the island\r\ncalled Great Britain. Probably the real relation of islands to the\r\nmatter is that owing to their isolation and freedom from the general\r\ncompetition of the vast variety of living things in continental areas,\r\nthey offer unoccupied territory in which either exceptionally small or\r\nexceptionally big races may flourish--if once they reach the island\r\nshelter, or are by variation produced there--without competitive\r\ninterference.\r\n\r\nAn important consideration in regard to the formation and segregation\r\nof a human variety or race is that mankind shows a tendency to\r\nsegregate in groups, like with like. To a large extent this is true\r\nalso of animals, but in man it acquires a special dominance, owing to\r\nthe greater activity in him of psychical or mental influences in all\r\nhis proceedings. The \"cagots\" of mid-France are the descendants of\r\nformer leper families. They remain separated from the rest of the\r\npopulation, and do not now know why, nor do their hostile neighbours.\r\nSuch \"outcast\" or \"accursed\" tribes and family groups are found also\r\nin Great Britain, and throughout the world. Possibly the \"pygmies\" owe\r\ntheir preservation to this tendency. Virchow regarded the Lapps as a\r\nrace produced by disease--a pathological product. It is possible that\r\nformer liability to disease and present immunity from it is the final\r\nexplanation of the tropical pygmy race. In the United States black\r\npigs are able to eat, without harm, a common marsh herb, the\r\n\"Red-root\" _Lachnanthes tinctoria_, which kills other pigs. Hence a\r\nblack race is established, not because it is black, but because, in\r\nit, blackness is \"the outward and visible sign of an inward and\r\nchemical grace\"--that is to say, of a physiological or chemical power\r\nof resistance to, and immunity from, the poison of an otherwise\r\nnutritious plant. Such \"correlations\" were described by Darwin, and\r\nare of extreme importance and interest--far more so than is, at\r\npresent, recognised by naturalists. I am inclined to the supposition\r\nthat the obvious outward signs, the round head, bombous forehead,\r\nfurry skin, and diminutive size of the pygmies are the outcome of an\r\ninward physiological condition peculiar to them, which has enabled\r\nthem to resist disease or to eat certain kinds of food, or possibly to\r\ndevelop great mental acuteness, and so has led to the establishment of\r\nthese peculiar small people as a race, without their smallness itself\r\nhaving anything to do with their selection and preservation. In that\r\ncase smallness would be a \"by-product,\" a \"correlated\" character, not\r\nthe \"effective life-saving\" character.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: \"Science from an Easy Chair,\" Methuen, 1909.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nPREHISTORIC PETTICOATS\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the last great extension of glaciers in Europe, during which\r\nnearly all of Great Britain and the North of France and Germany were\r\nburied with Scandinavia under one great ice-sheet--and when this\r\nice-sheet had receded, and the climate was like that of the Russian\r\n\"steppes,\" cold and dry--there were men inhabiting the caverns on both\r\nsides of the Pyrenees. The tract of land which we call \"Great Britain\"\r\nwas a part of the Continent of Europe. There was no \"English Channel.\"\r\nThe Thames and the Rhine opened by a common mouth into the North Sea.\r\nThe mammoth and the hairy rhinoceros still lingered on in France and\r\nthe more central regions of Europe. Wild horses, the great ox\r\n(Aurochs), the bison, ibex, chamois, were abundant, and the\r\nthick-nosed Saiga antelope, now confined to the Russian and Asiatic\r\nsteppes, was present. The most abundant and important animal\r\nimmediately north of the Pyrenees was the reindeer. The cave-men of\r\nFrance and Central Europe were a fine race--living by the chase, and\r\nfabricating flint knives and scrapers, fine bone spearheads and\r\nharpoons, as well as occupying themselves in carving ivory and\r\nreindeer antlers, so as to produce highly artistic representations of\r\nthe animals around them.\r\n\r\nThey rarely attempted the human face or figure, and when they did were\r\nnot so successful as in their animal work. They also painted on the\r\nwalls of some of their caverns, with red and yellow ochre, carbon, and\r\nwhite chalk representations--usually about one-third the size of\r\nnature--of some of the most important animals of the chase. They must\r\nhave used lamps, fed with animal fat, to illuminate the walls, both\r\nwhen they were at work on the pictures and also afterwards, when they\r\nexhibited the finished pictures to the less gifted members of the\r\ntribe, as wonderful, even magical appearances. It is uncertain to what\r\nextent races of men succeeded one another or were cotemporaries in\r\nthis period in Europe, but there is good reason for attributing the\r\ncave pictures to an early occupation of the caves by men who also\r\ncarved, in ivory and stone, small figures of women resembling the\r\nHottentot Venus--whilst the later occupants made no such statuettes,\r\nbut carved in relief on bone or engraved it.\r\n\r\nThis was probably not less than 50,000 years ago, and may well have\r\nbeen much more. Earlier than the date of these Reindeer men (the\r\nMagdalenians, Solutrians and the Aurignacians[9]), in the preceding\r\ncold, humid period of the glacial extension (probably from 80,000 to\r\n150,000 years ago) these and other caves were occupied by an inferior\r\nrace--the Neandermen. They could not carve beasts on ivory nor paint,\r\nbut could make very good and well \"dressed\" flint weapons, and could\r\nmake large fires in and about the caves, both to cook their meat and\r\nto keep off the wild beasts (lions, bears, and hyenas), who contended\r\nwith the strange, low-browed Neandermen for the use of the caves as\r\nhabitations.\r\n\r\nOn this side of the Pyrenees the Reindeer men have left some\r\nwall-pictures, and new discoveries of great importance in the form of\r\nrock carvings of human figures as well as pictures and huge figures of\r\nhorses, etc., are being made in France as I write these lines. But the\r\nbest preserved and most numerous wall pictures are those of the cave\r\nof Altamira near Santander. These comprise some partially preserved\r\nrepresentations in yellow, red, white, and black of the great bison,\r\nthe wild boar, the horse, and other animals. A group representing some\r\ntwenty-five or more animals (each about one third the size of nature),\r\nirregularly arranged, exists on a part of the roof, and others are\r\nfound in other parts of the cavern. Among the wall-pictures made by\r\nancient cave-men are numerous drawings of human beings in masks\r\nrepresenting animals' heads--probably indicating the \"dressing-up\" in\r\nanimal masks of priests or medicine men in the way in which we know\r\nto-day is the custom among many savage tribes. Twenty-seven of these\r\n\"decorated\" caverns were known in 1910--eleven in Spain, one in Italy,\r\nand fifteen in South and Central France--and others are continually\r\nbeing discovered. The most careful and critical examination by\r\nscientific men leaves no doubt as to the vast antiquity of these\r\npaintings, and as to their dating from a time when the animals painted\r\n(including in some cases mammoth and rhinoceros, as well as bison,\r\nreindeer, wild boar, ibex, red deer, bear, and felines) were existing\r\nin the locality. The covering up of some of the drawings (which are\r\npartly engraved and partly painted) by earthy deposits and by\r\nencrustations of lime, and the presence in the cave deposits of the\r\nworked flints and bones characteristic of the Reindeer men, leave no\r\ndoubt that these pictures are of that immense antiquity which we\r\nexpress by the words \"Quaternary period,\" \"Upper Pleistocene\" or\r\n\"Reindeer epoch.\"\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, only in accordance with what one would expect that\r\nthese pictures are of very varying degrees of artistic merit. But some\r\n(a considerable number) are quite remarkable for their true artistic\r\nquality. In this respect they differ from the rock paintings of modern\r\nsavage races--the Bushmen of South Africa, the Australians, and the\r\nCalifornian Indians--with which, however, it is instructive to compare\r\nthem. Many of them agree in their essential artistic character with\r\nthe carving and engraving of animals on bone and ivory so abundantly\r\nproduced by the later Reindeer men. It is also the fact that these\r\nFranco-Spanish wall paintings were executed at different periods in\r\nthe Reindeer epoch. Some are more primitive than others; some are very\r\nbadly preserved, mere scratched outlines with all the paint washed\r\naway by the moisture of ages; but others are bright and sharp in their\r\ncolouring to a degree which is surprising when their age and long\r\nexposure are considered. The French prehistorians, M.M. Cartailac and\r\nthe Abbé Breuil, have produced a sumptuous volume containing an\r\naccount, with large coloured plates, of the best preserved of the\r\nAltamira paintings--a copy of which I owe to the kindness of H.S.H.\r\nthe Prince of Monaco, who has ordered the publication of the work at\r\nhis own charges. This has been followed by an equally fine work under\r\nthe same auspices, illustrating the wall-pictures of the Cavern of the\r\nFont-de-Gaume in the Dordogne, for which we have to thank the Abbé\r\nBreuil. A further volume on Spanish Caves has also appeared from the\r\nsame source in the present year. It is not surprising that the country\r\nfolk, who, in some of the Spanish localities, have known the existence\r\nof these paintings from time immemorial, should regard them as the\r\nwork of the ancient Moors, all ancient work in Spain being popularly\r\nattributed to the Moors, as a sort of starting-point in history. It\r\nis, however, very remarkable that little damage appears to have been\r\ndone by the population to the paintings, even when they exist in\r\nshallow caves or on overhanging rocks. No doubt weathering, and the\r\noozing of moisture, and the flaking caused by it, has destroyed most\r\nof the Pleistocene paintings which once existed, and it is an\r\nascertained fact that some--for instance, those of Altamira--are\r\nbreaking to pieces owing to the opening-up and frequentation of the\r\ncaverns.\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked that, although these paintings belong to what is\r\ncalled the \"reindeer epoch,\" yet in the cave of Altamira there are no\r\nrepresentations of reindeer, but chiefly of bison and wild boar. It is\r\nalso remarkable that in the case of the painted rock shelters of\r\nCalapata (Lower Aragon) and of Cogul (near Lerida, in Catalonia), no\r\nreindeer are represented; but on the former there are very admirable\r\ndrawings of the red deer, and on the latter silhouettes of the bull,\r\nof the red deer, and the ibex. In fact, no representations of reindeer\r\nhave been observed on cave walls or rock-shelters south of the\r\nPyrenees. It is possible that this may be due to the date of the\r\nSpanish paintings being a good deal later than that of those French\r\ncave-paintings which show reindeer, mammoth, and rhinoceros. And we\r\nhave to bear in mind that in the North of Africa (Oran) engraved\r\ndrawings on exposed rocks are known, which are for good reasons\r\nattributed to the Neolithic period; that is to say, they are later\r\nthan the Reindeer epoch of the Palæolithic period, whilst some are\r\neven much later.\r\n\r\nIn any case we have to remember that there are two very different and\r\npossible explanations of the presence or absence either of certain\r\nanimals' bones or of representations of certain animals in one\r\n\"decorated\" cave and not in another. The one explanation is that\r\nanimals have succeeded one another in time in Western Europe--changing\r\nas the climatic conditions have changed--and that when, in two\r\ncave-decorations or cave-deposits compared, the animals are different,\r\nthe cause may be that the one deposit or cave-decoration is more\r\nrecent than the other. The other explanation is that (as we well know)\r\nat one and the same moment very different animals occupy tracts of\r\nland which are only a hundred miles or so apart, but differ in climate\r\nand general conditions. At this moment there are wild bears and also\r\nwolves in France, but none in England; the elk occurs in Sweden and\r\nRussia, but not in the West of Europe; the porcupine in Italy and in\r\nSpain, but not in France. As late as the historic period the African\r\nelephant flourished on the African shore of the Mediterranean, but not\r\nin Spain; now it is not found north of the Sahara at all. So we have\r\nvarious possibilities to consider in comparing the animal pictures on\r\nthe cave walls of Spain with those found in France, and may well\r\nsuspend judgment till we have knowledge of a greatly extended area.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI am anxious to draw attention in this chapter to the painted group of\r\nten human figures lately discovered on a rock shelter at Cogul, near\r\nLerida, in Catalonia, and figured and described in the admirable\r\nFrench journal called \"L'Anthropologie.\" These figures are those of\r\nyoung women dressed in short skirts and curious sleeves, the hair done\r\nup in a conical mass rising from the sides to the top of the head.\r\nEach figure is about ten inches high. The great interest about these\r\ndrawings is that they are probably tens of thousands of years old,\r\nand present to us the women of the reindeer or late Pleistocene epoch.\r\nNo other such painting of the women of this period is known, and the\r\nastonishing thing is that, though these are by no means fine specimens\r\nof prehistoric art, yet there is a definitely modern look about the\r\nfigures and a freedom of touch about the drawing which makes one think\r\nat first that the picture is some modern, hasty but clever sketch in\r\nsilhouette of a number of short skirted school girls at play. The\r\nwaist is extremely small and elongated, the skirt, or petticoat, bell\r\nshaped, and the whole figure \"sinuous.\" One of the figures appears to\r\nhave a cloak or jacket, but the breasts and legs are bare.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24.--Reproduction of drawings from a rock shelter\r\nnear Lerida, in Catalonia, representing a group of women clothed in\r\njacket and skirt with \"wasp-like\" waists. The original figures are ten\r\ninches high, and the drawing probably dates from the late Palæolithic\r\nperiod.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25.--A further portion of the same group as that\r\nshown in Fig. 24. In front is a small deer-like animal.]\r\n\r\nSome three years ago Sir Arthur Evans discovered in the palace of the\r\nancient Kings of Crete coloured frescoes some 3,500 years old\r\nrepresenting in great detail elegant young women with greatly\r\ncompressed waists, strongly-pronounced bustles, and elaborately\r\nornamented skirts. These Cretan paintings of prehistoric young women,\r\nboth in costume and pose, are like nothing so much as the portraits of\r\ndistinguished ladies of the fashionable world of Paris exhibited by\r\nthe painter, Boldini, in the \"Salon.\" It is remarkable that explorers\r\nshould have found contemporary paintings of young ladies who lived\r\nnearly as long before Cleopatra as she lived before us. And it is\r\nstill more remarkable that those young ladies were \"got up\" in the\r\nsame style, and apparently aimed at much the same effects of line and\r\nmovement, as those which have become the latest fashion in Paris, and\r\nmay be described as sinuous and serpentine. Not only is that the case,\r\nbut it is evident that the painter of Knossos, the Minotaur city, and\r\nM. Boldini have experienced the same artistic impression, and have\r\npresented in their pictures the same significance of pose and the same\r\nform, from the tip of the nose to the ends of the fingers and the\r\npoints of the toes--thus revealing a sympathy reaching across many\r\nages. It seems to me that the same artistic impression is to be\r\ndetected in the still earlier paintings of the wasp-waisted little\r\nladies of the Cogul rock-shelter in Catalonia. We find here the same\r\nsinuous figure with exaggeratedly compressed waist, prominent bosom,\r\nand emphasised haunches. But it is many, perhaps forty, thousands\r\nyears earlier! One is led to wonder whether this type of human\r\nfemale--to-day expressed with such masterly skill by Boldini--may not\r\nbe at the back of the mind of a portion of the human race--that which\r\npopulated what are now the shores of the Mediterranean, and probably\r\ncame there travelling northwards from the centre of Africa. Possibly\r\nthey brought with them that tendency to, and admiration for,\r\nmegalopygy which is evidenced by the makers of the earliest known\r\npalæolithic cave sculptures (the Aurignacians), and has persisted in\r\nsome degree ever since in Europe--a tendency and a taste which are on\r\nthe one hand totally absent in the East and Far East (Japan), and on\r\nthe other hand have a strong development in the modern Bushmen (and\r\nthe related Hottentots), an African race, and like the Spanish\r\ncave-men, rock painters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate VIII.--Votary or priestess of the goddess to whom\r\nsnakes were sacred. The original is a statuette in faïence, ten inches\r\nhigh, and was discovered by Sir Arthur Evans in the palace at Knossos\r\nin Crete. It dates from 1600 B.C.]\r\n\r\nI am able to reproduce here (Plates VIII and IX), through the kindness\r\nof Sir Arthur Evans and Dr. Hogarth, the keeper of the Ashmolean\r\nMuseum at Oxford, two very interesting drawings--showing certain\r\nfeatures in the dress of women in the prehistoric race which inhabited\r\nthe island of Crete for some three thousand years previous to the date\r\nof these representations, which is about 1600 B.C. They are\r\ninteresting to compare both with the much more ancient figures from\r\nthe Spanish cave and with modern female costume. The first (Plate\r\nVIII) is a figure in coloured pottery (faïence), representing either a\r\nvotary or priestess of a goddess to whom snakes were sacred. The\r\npetticoat of this lady is very modern, being long, decorated with\r\nflounces (a series of five) and bell-shaped. The dress is further\r\nremarkable for a tight ring-like girdle which greatly compresses the\r\nwaist and emphasises the broad hips. The little statue is about ten\r\ninches high, and was found by Sir Arthur Evans at Knossos, the ancient\r\nburied city the capital of Crete, in the Later Palace. Its date is\r\nthat of the close of the Minoan period, namely 1600 B.C. The two\r\nfigures in Plate IX are copied from frescoes representing acrobatic\r\nwomen from the bull-ring, also from the Later Palace at Knossos, and\r\nare a couple of centuries later in date. Religious ceremonies in\r\nconnection with the worship of the bull (whence the fable of the\r\nminotaur) were practised in Knossos, and possibly there was a kind of\r\nbaiting of bulls and jumping over and away from the infuriated animals\r\nsuch as may be seen at this day in the South of France and in\r\nPortugal. Possibly the employment of girls in this sport gave rise to\r\nthe story of the maiden tribute from Athens to be sacrificed to the\r\nCretan minotaur. The drawings are remarkable for the pose--that of the\r\nleft-hand resembling an attitude assumed in boxing, whilst the\r\ndress--a kind of maillot or \"tights\"--is gripped round the waist by a\r\nfirm ring (like a table-napkin ring), the compression of which is no\r\ndoubt exaggerated. This fresco and many others of extraordinary\r\ninterest, as well as much beautiful pottery and the whole of the plan\r\nof the city, its public buildings, granaries, library and sewers at\r\nseveral successive ages (the remains lying in layers one over the\r\nother), were discovered and described by Sir Arthur Evans, who is\r\nstill at work on the wonderful history and art of these prehistoric\r\nCretans, from whom the Mycenæans of the mainland of Greece were an\r\noffshoot.\r\n\r\nThe point to which I chiefly desire to call attention is that this\r\nCretan people practised compression of the waist, and so have a\r\ncertain point of agreement with the prehistoric race of Lerida\r\nrepresented in Figs. 24 and 25 and with Boldini's modern ladies. We\r\nknow from carvings and pottery that the men as well as the women of\r\nthe Mycenæan people wore a tightly-compressing girdle. The form of\r\nfigure thus produced--viz. relatively small, flexible waist, and large\r\nhips with protruding buttocks--seems to be a less pronounced variety\r\nof that of the small ivory figures of Aurignacian age (late\r\nPalæolithic) found in cave deposits of France and of that of the\r\nBushmen women. It seems as though the \"ideal\" female figure or that\r\nadmired and pictured by these races and by the modern Latin races is\r\nthe same in its main features, and differs altogether from that\r\nadmired in the Far East. Such deeply seated tastes may possibly\r\n(indeed, not improbably) be due to a common origin of the\r\nMediterranean and African peoples distinct from that of the Mongoloid\r\nAsiatic races.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate IX.--Fresco drawing of two female acrobats from\r\nthe palace of Knossos, date about 1400 B.C. The originals were\r\ndiscovered by Sir Arthur Evans.]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: A brief account of the skulls and implements of primitive\r\nman, with illustrations, is given in the first series of \"Science from\r\nan Easy Chair,\" published in 1910 by Methuen & Co.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nNEW YEAR'S DAY AND THE CALENDAR\r\n\r\n\r\nI came across a discussion the other day as to whether it is right to\r\ntell children and to let them believe that Santa Claus puts Christmas\r\npresents in their stockings, and that Peter Pan really comes in at the\r\nwindow and teaches nice little boys and girls to float through the\r\nair. I was surprised that anyone should be so singularly ignorant of\r\nchild-nature as to hold that children really believe these things.\r\nChildren have a wonderful and special faculty of \"make-believe,\" which\r\nis not the same as \"belief.\" All the time when a child is indulging in\r\n\"make-believe\" (a sort of willing self-illusion or waking dream) its\r\nreal, though tender, reasoning-power is merely \"suspended,\" and is not\r\noffended or outraged. That power can on emergency be brought to the\r\nfront, and the little one will say, \"Of course, they're not real,\" or\r\n\"I always knew he didn't really come down the chimney.\" So that I do\r\nnot think anyone need be anxious as to doing harm or laying the\r\nfoundations of future distrust by telling fairy-tales to the very\r\nyoung. If told in the right form and spirit they are received by\r\nsix-year-old and older children readily and naturally as belonging to\r\nthat delicious world of \"make-believe\" which (as one of their own\r\norators, I believe, has said) \"children of even the meanest\r\nintelligence will not be guilty of confounding with that very inferior\r\nevery-day world of reality in which we find, much to our regret, that\r\nit is necessary to spend so large a part of our time.\" The power of\r\nmake-believe is almost limitless, and makes its appearance even in the\r\nspeechless infant of less than two years old, who will gather fruit\r\nfrom a coloured picture, generously offer you a bite, and pretend to\r\nswallow the rest itself. Make-believe must have been a very big\r\nfactor in the life of the ape-like predecessors of prehistoric man.\r\n\r\nDeception in the world of reality is very different from make-believe,\r\nand a terrible thing. To the child--deception in regard to real\r\nthings, whatever excuses adults may put forward in its defence, is\r\nwell-nigh unforgivable. To be one who never says \"it is\" when it is\r\nnot, nor \"it will be\" when it will not be--that is to be a friend on\r\nwhom a child rests in perfect trust and happiness.\r\n\r\nWhat have these thoughts to do with the New Year? Merely this, that it\r\nis not only with and for children that we make-believe at this\r\nseason--we all of us, more or less, indulge in a make-believe about\r\nthe New Year. As the clock strikes its twelve notes at midnight on\r\nDecember 31st, and all the bells of a great city are heard hovering in\r\nthe air, sending forth their sweet sounds from far and near into the\r\nfateful night, there are few of us who have not a feeling that a great\r\nevent has occurred. A physical change has set in--the Old Year is dead\r\nand gone, and the New Year, something tangible, which you can let in\r\nat the door or the window--has just come into being, and is there\r\nwaiting for us. We are, of course, indulging in \"make-believe,\" for\r\nthere is no New Year, with any natural, noteworthy thing to mark its\r\ncommencement, starting at midnight on December 31st. New Years begin\r\nevery day and hour, and it is by no means agreed upon by all nations\r\nof the earth to pretend that the 1st of January is the critical day\r\nwhich we must regard as that portentous epoch, the beginning of the\r\nNew Year. This choice of a day was made by the Romans, and that\r\nwonderful man Julius Cæsar had a great deal to do with it; modern\r\nEurope adopted his arrangement of the year or calendar. But the Jews\r\nhave their own calendar and their own New Year's Day, which varies\r\nfrom year to year, from our September 5th to our October 7th. It is,\r\nhowever, to them always the first day of the month Tishri, and the\r\nfirst day of their new year. The Mahomedans took the date of the\r\nflight of Mohammed from Mecca to Medina--the night of July 15th, 622\r\nA.D.--as the commencement of their \"era,\" and its anniversary is the\r\nfirst day of their month Muharram and the first day of their\r\nyear--their New Year's Day. As, although they reckon twelve months to\r\nthe year, their months are true lunar months, and are not corrected as\r\nare those in use by us (as I will explain below); their year consists\r\nof 354 days 8 hours, and so does not run parallel to our year at all.\r\nTheir New Year's day, which began by being our July 16th, was in the\r\nnext year coincident with our July 6th, then in three successive years\r\nit occurred on different days of June, and so on through May, April,\r\nand the preceding months, so that in thirty-two and a half of our\r\nyears their New Year's Day has run through all our months and comes\r\nback again to July.\r\n\r\nSo much for New Year's Days; they are arbitrary selections, and though\r\nthe Roman New Year's Day, or January 1st, has been precisely defined\r\nand fixed by the determination by astronomers of the position of the\r\nearth on that day in its revolution around the sun, yet the original\r\nselection of January 1st for the beginning of the year seems to have\r\nbeen merely the result of previous errors and negligence in attempting\r\nto fix the winter solstice (which now comes out as December 22nd).\r\nThis is the day when the sun is lowest and the day shortest; after it\r\nhas passed the sun appears gradually to acquire a new power, and\r\nincreases the duration of his stay above the horizon until the longest\r\nday is reached--the summer solstice (June 21st). Julius Cæsar took\r\nJanuary 1st for New Year's Day as being the first day of a month\r\nnearest to the winter solstice. The ancient Greeks regarded the\r\nbeginning of September as \"New Year.\"\r\n\r\nWere mankind content with the measure of time by the completion of a\r\ncycle of revolution of the earth around the sun--that is the year--and\r\nby the revolution of the earth on its own axis--that is the day or\r\nday-night ([Greek: nychthêmeron]) of the Greeks--the notation of time\r\nand of seasons would be comparatively simple. No one seems to know why\r\nor when the day was first divided into twenty-four hours, nor why\r\nsixty minutes were taken in the hour and sixty seconds in the minute.\r\nThe ancient astronomers of Egypt and China, and their beliefs in\r\nmystical numbers, have to do with the first choosing of these\r\nintervals in unrecorded ages of antiquity (as much as 2000 or 3000\r\nB.C.). The seven days of the week correspond to the five planets known\r\nto the ancients, with the addition of the sun and the moon. But the\r\nGreeks made three weeks of ten days each in a month. The true\r\nyear--the exact period of a complete revolution of the earth around\r\nthe sun--is 365 days 5 hours 18 minutes and 46 seconds. It was\r\nmeasured with a fair amount of accuracy by very ancient races of men,\r\nwho fixed the position of the rising sun at the longest day by\r\nerecting big stones, one close at hand and one at a distance, so as to\r\ngive a line pointing exactly to the rising spot of the sun on the\r\nhorizon, as at Stonehenge. They recorded the number of days which\r\nelapsed before the longest day again appeared, and they marked also\r\nthe division of that period by the two events of equally long sunlight\r\nand darkness--the spring and the autumn \"equinox.\" It is obvious that\r\nif they took 365 days roughly as the period of revolution they would\r\n(owing to the odd hours and minutes left out) get about a day wrong in\r\nfour years, and it was the business of the priests--even in ancient\r\nRome the pontiffs were charged with this duty--to make the correction\r\nadd the missing day, and proclaim the chief days of the year--the\r\nshortest day, the longest day, and the equinox-days of equal halves of\r\nsunshine and darkness. In ancient China, if the State astronomer made\r\na wrong calculation in predicting an eclipse he was decapitated.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand how it became desirable to recognise more\r\nconvenient divisions of the year than the four quarters marked by the\r\nsolstices and the equinoxes. Various astronomical events were studied,\r\nand their regular recurrence ascertained, and they were used for this\r\npurpose. But the most obvious natural timekeeper to make use of,\r\nbesides the sun, was the moon. The moon completes its cycle of change\r\non the average in 29-1/2 days. It was used by every man to mark the\r\npassage of the year, and its periods from new moon to new moon were\r\ncalled, as in our language, \"months\" or \"moons,\" and divided into\r\nquarters. It is, however, an awkward fact that twelve lunar months\r\ngive 354 days, so that there are eleven days left over when the solar\r\nyear is divided into lunar months. The attempt to invent and cause the\r\nadoption of a system which shall regularly mark out the year into the\r\npopular and universally recognised \"moons,\" and yet shall not make the\r\nyear itself, so built up, of a length which does not agree with the\r\ntrue year recorded by the return of the rising sun to exactly the same\r\nspot on the horizon after 365 days and a few hours, has been\r\nthroughout all the history of civilised man, and even among\r\nprehistoric peoples, a matter of difficulty. It has led to the most\r\nvaried and ingenious systems, entrusted to the most learned priests\r\nand state officers, and mostly so complicated as to break down in the\r\nworking, until we come to the great clear-headed man Julius Cæsar.\r\n\r\nIn the very earliest times of the city of Rome the solar year, or\r\ncomplete cycle of the seasons, was divided into ten lunar months\r\ncovering 304 days, and it is not known how the remaining days\r\nnecessary to complete the solar revolution were dealt with, or\r\ndisposed of. The year was considered to commence with March, probably\r\nwith the intention of getting New Year's Day near to the spring\r\nequinox. The Celtic people and the Druids, with their mistletoe rites,\r\nkept New Year also at that time. The ten Roman months were named\r\nMartius, Aprilus, Maius, Junius, Quintillis, Sextilis, September,\r\nOctober, November, December. In the reign of the King Numa two months\r\nwere added to the year--namely, Januarius at the beginning and\r\nFebruarius at the end. In 452 B.C. February was removed from the end\r\nand given second place. The Romans thus arranged twelve months into\r\nthe year, as the ancient Egyptians and the Greeks had long before\r\ndone. The months were made by law to consist alternately of\r\ntwenty-nine and of thirty days (thus keeping near to the average\r\nlength of a true lunar cycle), and an odd day was thrown in for luck,\r\nmaking the year to consist of 355 days. This, of course, differs from\r\nthe solar year by ten days and a bit. To make the solar year and the\r\ncivil or calendar year coincide as nearly as might be, Numa ordered\r\nthat a special or \"intercalary\" month should be inserted every second\r\nyear between February 23rd and 24th. It was called \"Mercedonius,\" and\r\nconsisted of twenty-two and of twenty-three days alternately, so that\r\nfour years contained 1465 days, giving a mean of 366-1/4 days to each\r\nyear. But this gave nearly a day too much in each year of the calendar\r\n(as the legal or civil year is called) as compared with the true solar\r\nyear, agreement with which was the object in view. So another law was\r\nmade to reduce the excess of days in every twenty-four years.\r\nObviously the superintendence of these variations, and the public\r\ndeclaration of the calendar for each year, was a very serious and\r\nimportant task, affecting all kinds of legal contracts. The pontiffs\r\nto whom the duty was assigned abused their power for political ends,\r\nand so little care had they taken to regulate the civil year and keep\r\nit in coincidence with the solar year that in the time of Julius Cæsar\r\nthe civil equinox differed from the astronomical by three months, the\r\nreal spring equinox occurring, not at the end of what was called March\r\nby the calendar, but in June!\r\n\r\nJulius Cæsar took the matter in hand and put things into better order.\r\nHe abolished all attempt to record by the calendar a lunar year of\r\ntwelve lunar months; he fixed the length of the civil year to agree as\r\nnear as might be with that of the solar year, and arbitrarily altered\r\nthe months; in fact, abandoned the \"lunar month\" and instituted the\r\n\"calendar month.\" Thus he decreed that the ordinary year should be 365\r\ndays, but that every fourth year (which, for some perverse reason, we\r\ncall \"leap\" year) should have an extra day. He ordered that the\r\nalternate months, from January to November inclusive, should have\r\nthirty-one days and the others thirty days, excepting February, which\r\nwas to have in common years twenty-nine, but in every fourth year (our\r\nleap year) thirty. This perfectly reasonable, though arbitrary,\r\ndefinition of the months was accompanied by the alteration of the name\r\nof the month Quintilis to Julius, in honour of the great man. Later\r\nAugustus had the name of the month Sextilis altered to Augustus for\r\nhis own glorification, and in order to gratify his vanity a law was\r\npassed taking away a day from February and putting it on to August, so\r\nthat August might have thirty-one days as well as July, and not the\r\ninferior total of thirty previously assigned to it! At the same time,\r\nso that three months of thirty-one days might not come together,\r\nSeptember and November were reduced to thirty days, and thirty-one\r\ngiven to October and December. In order to get everything into order\r\nand start fair Julius Cæsar restored the spring equinox to March 25th\r\n(Numa's date for it, but really four days late). For this purpose he\r\nordered two extraordinary months, as well as Numa's intercalary month\r\nMercedonius, to be inserted in the year 47 B.C., giving that year in\r\nall 445 days. It was called \"the last year of confusion.\" January 1st,\r\nforty-six years before the birth of Christ and the 708th since the\r\nfoundation of the city, was the first day of \"the first Julian year.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough Julius Cæsar's correction and his provisions for keeping the\r\n\"civil\" year coincident with the astronomical year were admirable, yet\r\nthey were not perfect. His astronomer, by name Sosigenes, did his\r\nbest, but assumed the astronomical year to be 11 min. 14 sec. longer\r\nthan it really is. In 400 years this amounts to an error of three\r\ndays. The increasing disagreement of the \"civil\" and the \"real\"\r\nequinox was noticed by learned men in successive centuries. At last,\r\nin A.D. 1582, it was found that the real astronomical equinox, which\r\nwas supposed to occur on March 25th, when Julius Cæsar introduced his\r\ncalendar (not on March 21st, as was later discovered to be the fact),\r\nhad retrograded towards the beginning of the civil year, so that it\r\ncoincided with March 11th of the calendar. In order to restore the\r\nequinox to its proper place (March 21st), Pope Gregory XIII directed\r\nten days to be suppressed in the calendar--of that year--and to\r\nprevent things going wrong again it was enacted that leap-year day\r\nshall not be reckoned in those centenary years which are not multiples\r\nof 400. Thus Pope Gregory got rid of three days out of the Julian\r\ncalendar, or civil year, in every 400 years, since 1600 was retained\r\nas a leap-year, but 1700, 1800 and 1900, though according to the\r\nformer law leap-years, were made common years, whilst 2000 will be a\r\nleap-year. In order to correct a further minute error, namely, the\r\nfact that the calendar year as now amended is 26 sec. longer than the\r\ntrue solar year, it is proposed that the year 4000 and all its\r\nmultiples shall be common years, and not leap years. This is a matter\r\nwhich, though practical, is of distinctly remote importance. Some\r\npeople like to look well ahead.\r\n\r\nThe alteration in the calendar made by Pope Gregory was successfully\r\nopposed for a long time in Great Britain by popular prejudice. It was\r\ncalled \"new style,\" and was at last accepted, as in other European\r\ncountries, but has never been adopted in Russia, which retains the\r\n\"old style.\" An Act of Parliament was passed in 1751 ordering that the\r\nday following September 2nd, 1752, should be accounted the fourteenth\r\nof that month. Many people thought that they had been cheated out of\r\neleven days of life, and there were serious riots! The change had been\r\nalready made in Scotland in the year 1600 without much outcry. The\r\nScotch were either too \"canny\" or too dull to \"fash\" themselves about\r\nit.\r\n\r\nLet us now revert for a moment to the proceedings of Oriental\r\npotentates in regard to astronomers, a class of scientific\r\nfunctionaries whom they have from remote ages been in the habit of\r\nemploying. It appears that in China there is no attempt to make the\r\ncivil year or year of the calendar coincide with the astronomical\r\nyear. The astronomical year is reckoned as beginning when the sun\r\nenters Capricorn, our winter solstice, and is thus more reasonably\r\ndefined than is the commencement of our New Year, which is nine days\r\nlate. Twelve months are recognised; the first is called Tzu, the\r\nsecond Chou, and the third Yin, and the rest respectively Mao, Chen,\r\nSu, Wu, Wei, Shen, Yu, Hsu, Hai. But the calendar year, on the other\r\nhand, begins just when the Emperor chooses to say it shall. He is like\r\nthe captain of a ship, who says of the hour, \"Make it so,\" and it is\r\nso. With great ceremony he issues a calendar ten months in advance,\r\nfixing as he pleases all the important festive and lucky days of the\r\nyear. Various emperors have made New Year's Day in the fourth, third,\r\nsecond, first, or twelfth month. It has now been fixed for many\r\ncenturies in the second astronomical month. I have mentioned above\r\nthat the ancient Greeks reckoned the New Year as beginning about the\r\nend of September. But the reckoning differed in the different States,\r\nand so did the names of the months. Although the Greek astronomers\r\ndetermined the real solar year with remarkable accuracy, and proposed\r\nvery clever modes of correcting the calendar so as to use the lunar\r\nmonths in reckoning, there was no general system adopted, no agreement\r\namong the \"home-ruling\" States.\r\n\r\nI have stated above that the official Chinese astronomers sometimes\r\nget their heads cut off for not correctly foretelling an eclipse.\r\nIllustrating this there is the following story of a visit paid about\r\nforty years ago to the Observatory in Greenwich Park by the Shah of\r\nPersia of that date. The Persians have many close links with the\r\nChinese, and share their view of astronomy as a sort of State\r\nfunction, in which the Emperor has special authority. The Shah\r\naccordingly made a great point of visiting the British State\r\nobservatory, in company with King Edward, who was then Prince of\r\nWales. Sir George Airy was the Astronomer Royal, and showed the party\r\nover the building and gave them peeps through telescopes. \"Now show me\r\nan eclipse of the sun,\" said the Shah, speaking in French. Sir George\r\npretended not to hear, and led the way to another instrument. \"Dog of\r\nan astronomer,\" said the Shah, \"produce me an eclipse!\" Sir George\r\npolitely said he had not got one and could not oblige the King of\r\nKings. \"Ho, ho!\" said the Shah, turning in great indignation to the\r\nPrince of Wales. \"You hear! cut his head off!\" Sir George's life was,\r\nas a matter of fact, spared, but in the course of a year he retired,\r\nand was succeeded by another Astronomer Royal. On his appointment that\r\ngentleman was astonished at receiving a letter of congratulation from\r\nthe Shah of Persia. The Shah evidently thought that his bloodthirsty\r\nrequest had been attended to, though with some delay. He proceeded to\r\ntell the new Astronomer Royal that he had a few days before writing\r\nwitnessed a total eclipse of the sun in the observatory at Teheran.\r\nThis was perfectly correct. The suggestion was that the Teheran\r\nastronomers knew their business, and had the good sense to arrange an\r\neclipse when a Royal Visitor wished for one, and so escape\r\ndecapitation--a course which the kindly Shah evidently wished to\r\nindicate to the new and young Astronomer Royal as that which he should\r\npursue in order to avoid the fate of his unhappy and obstinate\r\npredecessor. The attitude of the Shah towards science is one which is\r\nnot altogether unknown in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nEASTERTIDE, SHAMROCKS AND SPERMACETI\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people think of Easter as a Christian festival, but it is really\r\nin name and origin a pagan one. The word \"Easter\" is the modern form\r\nof \"Eastra,\" the name of the Anglo-Saxon goddess of spring (in\r\nprimitive Germanic, \"Austro\"). The Germans, like ourselves, keep its\r\ntrue pagan name, \"Ostern.\" The Latin nations use for Easter the word\r\nPascha (French, Pâque), the Greek form of the Jewish name for the\r\nfeast of the Passover, with which it is historically associated by the\r\nChristian Church. Terrible quarrels have occurred in early ages over\r\nfixing Easter Day and its exact relation to the Jewish calendar. This\r\nis the explanation of its being \"a movable feast\" and of the\r\nconsequent inconvenience to Parliament, schoolboys, and\r\nBank-holiday-makers at the present day. It must be admitted that when\r\nEaster comes as early as it sometimes does those who have but the\r\nshort spring holiday of the Easter week-end are hardly used. Instead\r\nof enjoying the sunny spring weather of Austro, and the flowers and\r\nthe bursting buds which an Easter at the end of April often gives,\r\nthey have to put up with the dreary chill of arid March, and this,\r\nabsurdly enough, is all on account of a mistaken attempt at accuracy\r\nmade by the Church some sixteen hundred or more years ago in trying to\r\nbring the Christian festival into line with the Jewish Passover. If it\r\nwere desired to celebrate the Feast of the Resurrection each year on\r\nthe day corresponding astronomically with that indicated in the\r\nGospels, the Astronomer Royal would have no difficulty in exactly\r\nfixing the day, making due allowance for the changes of the calendar\r\nand for the irregularities of the Jewish year. I do not know what day\r\nin what month such a calculation would finally establish as that of\r\nthe ecclesiastical festival, but the Bank Holiday and the Anglo-Saxon\r\nEaster might be dealt with separately, and assigned, once for all, to\r\nthe end of April, the real \"opening,\" or spring month.\r\n\r\nThe yellow \"tansy cakes\" which used to be, and the coloured eggs which\r\nstill are, given away at Easter throughout Europe, are not of\r\nChristian origin, but belong to the Roman celebration (at the same\r\nseason, viz., April 12th to 15th) of the goddess of Plenty--Ceres.\r\nEggs are the symbols of fecundity and the renewal of life in the\r\nspring. They were decorated and given in baskets by rich Romans to\r\ntheir friends and dependents at this season. \"Hot-cross buns\" are\r\npeculiar to England, and no doubt have a Christian significance. They\r\nhave not survived in Scotland, although Easter eggs are well known\r\nthere (sometimes they are called \"pace-eggs\"), nor on the Continent,\r\nwhere \"Pascal eggs\" are an institution. \"Buns\" owe their name to the\r\nold Norse word \"bunga,\" a convexity or round lump, preserved also in\r\nour words \"bunion\" and \"bung.\" In Norman French it became \"bonne,\" and\r\nin the fourteenth century was applied to the round loaf of bread given\r\nto a horse; the loaf was called Bayard's bonne (pronounced \"bun\"). In\r\nsome parts of England a \"bunny\" still means a swelling due to a blow.\r\n\r\nThe April fish, the \"poisson d'Avril,\" is the polite French term for\r\nwhat we call an \"April fool.\" But why a fish is introduced in this\r\nconnection I am unable to say. The custom of sending people on fool's\r\nerrands on the First of April is probably due to the change of the\r\ncalendar in France in 1564; but there is a Hindoo feast on March 31st,\r\nwhen similar jokes are perpetrated. It is called \"Huli,\" which, in\r\naccordance with phonetic laws, readily becomes \"Fooli.\" This is\r\nprobably only a coincidence.\r\n\r\nA curious Easter custom in country districts in England used to be\r\n(perhaps still is) that called \"lifting\" or \"heaving.\" On Easter\r\nMonday two men will join hands so as to form a seat; their companions\r\nthen \"by right of custom\" compel the women they may meet to sit, one\r\nafter the other, on the improvised throne and be lifted or heaved as\r\nhigh as may be. On Easter Tuesday the women perform the same rite upon\r\nthe men. Strangers thus assailed have been much disconcerted and have\r\nrecorded their astonishment in \"notes of travel.\" The custom is said\r\nto be a popular degeneration of the celebration of the Resurrection.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn early Easter falls little in advance of St. Patrick's Day, when\r\nthere is much \"wearing of the green\" and questioning as to what plant\r\nis \"the real shamrock.\" This matter has become so involved and\r\ndeveloped by wild enthusiasm, ignorance, and false sentiment that it\r\nis difficult to deal with it. A distinguished Irishman once showed me\r\nthe \"shamrock\" he was wearing in his buttonhole as \"the true\" plant of\r\nthat name. He assured me that he had studied the subject from boyhood\r\nand knew well the true and the false. \"What is its flower like?\" I\r\nasked him. \"It never has a flower at all,\" he said. Another injustice\r\nto Ireland, one must suppose, or a miracle of St. Patrick's! His\r\n\"green\" was a bit of the small variety of the common clover,\r\n_Trifolium repens_, which, of course, produces the usual tuft of\r\nflorets or clover-head. It is true that this plant has now been\r\nvulgarly substituted for St. Patrick's shamrock. The shamrock is not\r\nreally the common clover nor any variety of it. The common Dutch\r\nclover and its varieties were introduced into Ireland two hundred\r\nyears ago from England and are not Irish at all! The true shamrock is\r\nthe delicate little wood-sorrel, _Oxalis acetosella_, which has a\r\nbeautifully formed three-split or trefoil leaf of the most vivid green\r\ncolour, and a white flower like that of a geranium. It is called\r\n\"fairy-bell\" by the Welsh, and was believed to ring chimes for the\r\nelfin folk. It was also greatly esteemed for its acid flavour and for\r\nvarious reputed medicinal and magical properties by the Druids and\r\namong the early inhabitants of Great Britain and Ireland. Pliny says\r\nit never shelters a snake, and is an antidote to the poison of\r\nserpents and scorpions--a good reason for its association with St.\r\nPatrick! It had already a reputation and sanctity when, if tradition\r\nbe true, St. Patrick used its threefold leaf to symbolise the doctrine\r\nof the Trinity.\r\n\r\nIt is much rarer to find the wood-sorrel trefoil with a fourth leaflet\r\nthan it is to find the clover trefoil so provided. The two plants\r\nbelong to families widely separated from one another. The ancient\r\narchitectural decoration of trefoil carving, and also the heraldic\r\nshamrock in the arms of the United Kingdom, represent the leaf of the\r\nwood-sorrel, and not that of the clover. No doubt there has been some\r\nsentimental intention in putting forward the humble, abundant,\r\ndown-trodden dwarf-clover, the very sod itself of Ireland (really\r\nintroduced from England) as \"the shamrock!\" But, as often happens in\r\nsuch cases, truth and the ancient and honourable tradition of a\r\nbeautiful thing have been wantonly disregarded in order to do business\r\nin cheap sentiment. Traders are always ready to take advantage of an\r\nignorant public. Common sprats are called \"sardines,\" the name of\r\nanother and rarer fish, in order to conceal the fact that they are\r\nsprats; clarified horse fat is called \"fresh country butter,\" and\r\nIrish regiments are made to decorate themselves with common clover\r\nunder the delusion that it is the shamrock. Other plants have been\r\nfrom time to time utilised to usurp the title of \"shamrock.\" Thus the\r\nsmall Lucerne clover or medicago is often sold as \"shamrock\" to Irish\r\npatriots, and the watercress has been solemnly pat forward as the true\r\nshamrock simply because old writers tell us, as evidence of the\r\nbarbarous state of the Irish, that they fed upon shamrocks and\r\nwatercress. The true shamrock (the wood-sorrel) was formerly greatly\r\nvalued all over Europe as a salad and a flavouring herb on account of\r\nits leaves containing oxalic acid. It was used for the manufacture of\r\noxalic acid, which was sold as \"salts of lemons\" for removing\r\niron-mould. It was the basis of the soup and of the green sauce for\r\nfish, in which the dock-sorrel (Rumex) has now taken its place. The\r\nname \"shamrock\" is an old Irish word, written \"seamragg,\" and means a\r\nlittle \"trefoil.\" Curiously enough there appears to be an Oriental\r\nword, \"shamrakh,\" which I am told is of Arabic origin, and also means\r\na trefoil. In English writers from the seventeenth century onwards the\r\nIrish shamrock is variously written of as \"shamroots,\" \"shamerags\"\r\n(this and the next following with hostile intent), \"shame-rogues,\"\r\n\"sham-brogues,\" and \"sham-rug.\"\r\n\r\nI am sorry to say that Shakespeare does not mention the shamrock at\r\nall. No Irishman who knows the little oxalis or wood-sorrel could wish\r\nfor a more beautiful floral emblem of the Emerald Isle, or dream of\r\nletting the vulgar Saxon intruder--the dwarf clover--take its place.\r\nPerhaps it is the Ulstermen who have set up the foreign \"Dutch\" clover\r\nto replace the true shamrock, the wood-sorrel. These changes are\r\neasily made. For instance, \"green\" is not the original colour of\r\nIreland, but light blue--Cambridge blue!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis chapter is one of varied material, and I now pass abruptly from\r\nfresh emerald leaflets to the waxy crystals stewed out of the fat of a\r\nmonster's head. There has seldom been a controversy so entertaining as\r\nthat between Dr. Bode (the talented director of the Art Gallery of\r\nBerlin) and his opponents, in regard to the age of the wax-bust which\r\nhe purchased not long ago for £8,000 in Bond Street in the belief that\r\nit was the work of Leonardo da Vinci. Science has had its share in the\r\nexamination of the bust. The last scientific contribution to the\r\nmatter was the discovery by an analytical chemist, Dr. Pinkus, that\r\nthe waxy mixture of which the bust is composed consists in definite\r\nproportion of spermaceti. Now since spermaceti was not used before the\r\nyear 1700, the bust cannot (say Dr. Bode's opponents) have been made\r\nby Leonardo da Vinci, who died in the early part of the sixteenth\r\ncentury. \"Nonsense!\" reply Dr. Bode's supporters, \"Shakespeare makes\r\nHotspur speak of 'parmaceti,' and it was well known to the doctors of\r\nSalerno in 1100 A.D., and probably used by the ancients.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the opponents of Dr. Bode are right. I am sorry, because\r\nDr. Bode is, in regard to \"works of art,\" a most able expert, and I\r\nthink it is better that experts should always be right. Spermaceti was\r\nknown, probably from classical times onwards, as a rare and precious\r\nunguent, \"resolutive and mollifying,\" as M. Pomel, \"chief druggist to\r\nthe late French King Louis XIV,\" says in his treatise on drugs,\r\ntranslated into English in 1737. It was applied as a liniment for\r\nhardness of the skin and breasts, and was also taken internally.\r\nShakespeare's reference to it is \"parmaceti for an inward bruise.\" The\r\nfact is it was known and used in small quantity before 1700 A.D. in\r\nconnection with medicine and the toilet, but was not consumed by the\r\nthousand tons a year, as it was after the hunting of the sperm whale\r\nor cachalot (_Physeter mecrocephalus_) had been set a-going by the\r\nbrave fishermen of Nantucket and the Northern Atlantic coast of\r\nAmerica in 1690. In 1730 or thereabouts the English and the Dutch also\r\nsent out ships to take part in this perilous industry, which is now\r\nagain, in its dwindled condition, exclusively American. It is the\r\npursuit of by far the biggest and fiercest animal which man has doomed\r\nto extinction. Those who enjoy such stories of adventure should read\r\nMr. Bullen's personal narrative, \"The Cruise of the Cachalot.\" It was\r\nat the end of the eighteenth century that spermaceti became so\r\nabundant in the market that candles of it were manufactured and sold\r\ncheaper than those of wax. From about 1860 it was superseded by\r\nparaffin and other wax-like products: and it was at its cheapest\r\nperiod, and when it was most widely in use, that Lucas, the English\r\nartist, who made many wax busts and statuettes, is known to have mixed\r\nit, in the form of \"old candles,\" with beeswax, in order to form the\r\ncomposition which he used in his works. The evidence given by the\r\nchemist, Dr. Pinkus, appears to me to be conclusive (even without the\r\nevidence of the old clothes stuffed into the hollow of the bust)\r\nagainst the theory that the Bode wax-bust of Flora is more ancient\r\nthan the nineteenth century, and much in favour of its being the work\r\nof Lucas, who is exceptionally known as a wax-modeller of repute sixty\r\nyears ago, who did use spermaceti.\r\n\r\nSpermaceti is a perfectly definite chemical body, which can be\r\nrecognised without chance of error. It is a combination of palmitic\r\nacid and a peculiar hydrocarbon, called (after the whale) \"cetyl,\" and\r\neasily forms pure crystals. Before sperm whales were hunted it was\r\nobtained in relatively small quantity from individual sperm whales,\r\nwhich by misadventure landed themselves on the coast of France, Spain,\r\nor Great Britain, and was eagerly purchased by the apothecaries and\r\nperfumers of the great cities of Europe. There are several records of\r\nsuch strange mistakes on the part of the great sperm whale. Only ten\r\nor fifteen years ago one was stranded on the Lincolnshire coast,\r\nwhilst the specimen exhibited in the Natural History Museum was washed\r\nashore at Thurso in Caithness. The spermaceti is found dissolved in\r\nthe more ordinary oil (or fat), which occupies a huge region above the\r\nbones of the upper jaw and gives the sperm whale its barrel-shaped\r\nhead. It separates on cooling, from the liquid oil, in crystalline\r\nflakes, forming great masses, which are purified by re-melting and\r\ncooling. In early times the fine waxy, flaky material thus obtained\r\nwas known in samples of a few ounces, and sold by apothecaries. It was\r\nknown that it came from a whale, and was believed to be the seed or\r\nsperm of that animal, hence its name \"spermaceti.\" M. Pomel, whom I\r\ncited above, believed it to come from the brain of the whale called\r\n\"cachalot.\" No one would have dreamt in the sixteenth century of\r\nmixing this precious stuff with beeswax for modelling purposes. At\r\nthat date one would as soon have mixed amber with pitch. That reminds\r\nme that \"grey amber\" or \"ambergris\" is also a product of the sperm\r\nwhale not to be confounded with spermaceti. It is an unhealthy\r\nintestinal concretion like bezoar-stone (see p. 64), only\r\nexceptionally produced. It is found floating in the ocean, and is\r\nrecognised as coming from the cachalot owing to its being largely made\r\nup of the horny beaks of cuttle-fish, upon which the cachalot feeds.\r\nIt is still used in perfumery, and fetches the extraordinary price of\r\nfour guineas the ounce. A piece weighing 4-1/2 oz. may be seen in\r\nCromwell Road.\r\n\r\nThough the oils (or fats) of plants and animals are very similar to\r\none another in appearance, there are a very large number of them\r\ndiffering chemically from one another. Thus the fat or oil of dozens\r\nof different nuts and plant-products and of lower animals and fishes,\r\nand of sheep, oxen, pigs, dogs, elephants, and men contain different\r\nand special chemical substances, corresponding to the \"cetyl\" which is\r\npresent in the fat of the sperm whale's head. Many of them have\r\nacquired as a result of experience and tradition special value for\r\nsome special purpose. Several oils have peculiar fitness and great\r\nvalue for oiling delicate machinery; others are used in curing\r\nleather, for burning, and for medicinal ointments, whilst a large\r\nvariety is used as human food.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nMUSEUMS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe word \"museum\" is not one of those which explain themselves and\r\ngive an indication of what the thing to which they are applied should\r\nbe, when it has ceased to be what it was intended to be. In ancient\r\nGreece the word \"mouseion\" meant \"the place of the Muses\"--a grove or\r\na temple--and there was such a place on a part of the Acropolis of\r\nAthens, the rocky temple-crowned hill around which the city was built.\r\nThere were other \"museums,\" or seats of the Muses, in ancient Greece;\r\nthose on the slopes of Mount Helicon and of Mount Olympus were the\r\nmost famous. In modern times a picture gallery and art collection,\r\nthat of the Louvre, in Paris, is called \"the Musée,\" whilst \"the\r\nMuséum\" (the Latin form of the same word) is the name distinctively\r\napplied in Paris to the collections of natural history and the\r\nlaboratories connected with them in the Jardin des Plantes. In London\r\n\"the British Museum,\" founded in 1753, originally comprised the\r\nnational library as well as collections of antiquities and of natural\r\nhistory. In Heidelberg \"the Museum\" was the name, when I was there,\r\nfor a delightful club, with a garden. It belonged to the professors,\r\ntheir families, and their friends in the town, and concerts and dances\r\nwere given in it. It seems that the Heidelberg \"Museum\" comes nearest\r\nto the original meaning of the word as \"a seat of Muses,\" for nearly\r\nall those mythical ladies were remarkable for their special patronage\r\nof music, dancing, and song.\r\n\r\nWho were these goddesses, the Muses, and what were their names? What\r\nwas the speciality of each, and how do they come to have to do with\r\ncollections of works of art and specimens of natural history? Two\r\nlearned \"classical\" friends whom I lately met in Paris could not help\r\nme further than by giving me the names of the first three. I was a\r\nlittle shocked, but the next evening discovered that these goddesses\r\nare, in modern times, very generally neglected and ignored. In an\r\nextremely amusing play, called \"Le Bois Sacré\"--the Sacred Grove (of\r\nthe Muses)--a name applied jocosely to the Ministry of Fine Arts--I\r\nfound that the minister of that department was represented as a\r\npompous and fatuous person who completely fails to call to mind, in\r\nthe course of an eloquent speech, the name of more than one. On\r\nringing for his secretaries and airily asking them to refresh his\r\nmemory, he did not succeed in extracting from them more than two\r\ndoubtful additions to his list!\r\n\r\nI am able, nevertheless (after due investigation), to put my reader in\r\npossession of the facts so unfamiliar to the modern oracles of\r\nclassical mythology! Briefly, it appears that in the best period of\r\nancient Greece nine Muses were recognised, namely, Calliope, the Muse\r\nof epic poetry; Euterpé, of lyric poetry; Erato, of erotic poetry;\r\nMelpomené, of tragedy; Thalia, of comedy; Polyhymnia, of sacred hymns;\r\nTerpsichoré, of choral song and dance; Clio, of history; and Urania,\r\nof astronomy. The last two seem to have very little in common with the\r\naddiction to singing and dancing characteristic of the rest, and are\r\nthe only ones who can be imagined as feeling themselves at home in a\r\nmodern museum, excepting on those evenings when the authorities use\r\nthe museum (as is the custom in London) for a \"conversazione,\"\r\nenlivened by brass bands and songs.\r\n\r\nApollo was said to be the leader and master of the Muses, but was not\r\nrelated to them. They were in origin the \"nymphs\" or \"genii\" of\r\nmountain streams worshipped by an ancient bardic race (resembling our\r\nown sweet-singing Welsh folk), the Thracians. At first the number of\r\nthe Muses was indefinite, and they had no names. Then three were\r\nnamed--one of Meditation (Meleté), one of Memory (Mnemé), and one of\r\nSong (Aöidé)--a much prettier embodiment of the impression made on a\r\npoetical mind by rock-pools and cascades and leafy gorges than the\r\nformal and redundant nine of later times. One can associate the\r\nprimitive three with a museum of natural history; but the later\r\nofficial goddesses, each insisting on her own department of poetry,\r\nare too clearly representative of the all-appropriating pretensions of\r\nliterature in modern seats of learning. They remind me of the\r\nenumeration of studies which a dear old head of an Oxford college\r\ninnocently regarded as complete and reasonable when he assured me that\r\nall branches of knowledge were fairly and equally represented on the\r\ncollege staff. \"We have,\" he said, \"a lecturer on Greek literature,\r\none on Latin literature, one on Greek history, one on Roman history,\r\none on classical philology, one on modern history, one on mathematics\r\nand one on the natural sciences.\" What more, he asked, could you wish\r\nfor?\r\n\r\nIt appears that, without any special reference to the attributes of\r\nthe Muses, the word \"museum\" has been adopted in recent times for a\r\nbuilding in which collections of works of art and specimens of natural\r\nhistory are housed, and even for the collections themselves--in\r\nconsequence of the foundation by the Ptolemaic Kings of Egypt of a\r\nsplendid institution at Alexandria to which the name museum (mouseion)\r\nwas given. It included the great library, apparatus for the study of\r\nastronomy, anatomy, and other sciences, and collections of all kinds.\r\nThe most learned men were employed in its management and were lodged\r\nthere and provided with the means of study and teaching. It was a\r\ncombination of university, learned academy, and temple, and was the\r\npride of the ancient world. It survived many changes of lordship, but\r\nat last the library and collections were deliberately destroyed by\r\nMoslem invaders in 640 A.D. The precious manuscripts were served out\r\nas fuel for the public baths, and were so numerous that it took some\r\nmonths to consume them! The destruction of the museum of Alexandria\r\nmarks the commencement of the \"Dark Ages\"; the ancient culture was\r\ndead. Eight centuries of submergence with strange mysterious\r\nupfloatings were its fate until the Renascence, when its fragments\r\nwere recovered, and soon did more harm than good to the\r\nfetish-worshipping peoples of Europe.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first use of the word \"museum\" in this country for a place in\r\nwhich collections of ancient works of art and specimens of natural\r\nhistory were stored and arranged for exhibition was in the early\r\neighteenth century, when it was applied to the building at Oxford,\r\nerected for Mr. Ashmole's collections, presented to the University.\r\nThis was called \"Ashmole's Museum,\" or the Ashmolean Museum.\r\nPreviously such a collection and its location were spoken of as \"a\r\ncabinet of rare and curious objects.\" \"Museum\" was occasionally used\r\nfor what we now call a \"study,\" and even to describe lecture-rooms and\r\nlibrary. I have not been able to discover that the word was used in\r\nits modern sense at an earlier date on the Continent than in England.\r\nThe first great typical example of a \"museum\" was the British Museum,\r\nfounded in 1753. Montagu House, in Bloomsbury, was purchased by the\r\nState to serve as a \"repository\" (the word used in the Act of\r\nParliament of that date) for the vast collections of natural history\r\nmade by Sir Hans Sloane, with which were associated certain valuable\r\nlibraries and collections of manuscripts, of coins, and antique\r\nmarbles. A large part of the money required for the undertaking was\r\nraised by a public lottery, over which the Archbishop of Canterbury,\r\nthe Lord Chancellor, and the Speaker presided (according to the custom\r\nof those days in regard to State lotteries), and it is thus that this\r\nremarkable group of great officials became, and have remained ever\r\nsince, \"the Three Principal Trustees of the British Museum.\"\r\nAdditional trustees were named (since increased to a total of nearly\r\nfifty), and provision was made for the appointment of a principal\r\nlibrarian and other curators of the collections. The Act declared that\r\nthe collections placed in the \"repository\" (Montagu House) were to\r\nremain there for the benefit and enjoyment of posterity for ever--a\r\nprovision which until seven years ago was misinterpreted, so as to\r\nprevent the sending out of unnamed and unstudied collections of small\r\nportable objects like insects, dried plants, and shells, to be named\r\nand compared with other specimens, by foreign naturalists.\r\nConsequently, there was a great accumulation of specimens unstudied\r\nand useless, and a great loss to knowledge. But the late Lord\r\nChancellor (Halsbury) decided that it was not only legally within the\r\npower of the trustees temporarily to remove specimens from \"the\r\nrepository\" for the purpose of having them named and studied, but\r\nactually their duty to do so.\r\n\r\nWe now very generally recognise in Great Britain, as in other parts of\r\nthe civilised world, the value and importance of public \"museums\" in\r\nthe sense of \"repositories of collections of objects of ancient and\r\nmodern art and of natural history.\" Museums, as at present existing,\r\nmay be divided into four kinds, according to the nature of the public\r\nor private bodies by which they have been set up and carried on. There\r\nare, first of all, national museums maintained and continually\r\nincreased by the expenditure of a great State, and placed in the\r\ncapital city; secondly, provincial or local museums, supported by a\r\nmunicipality or by local munificence; thirdly, academic museums, which\r\nare those related to the instruction and investigations carried on in\r\na university or a school, and forming part of its regular provision\r\nfor study; and, fourthly, the museums of private individuals (which as\r\na rule, become eventually transferred by gift or purchase to some\r\nexisting public museum).\r\n\r\nThe word \"museum\" would, and often does, fitly include picture\r\ngalleries, but very usually in Great Britain a museum is not\r\nconsidered as comprising a picture gallery, and a picture gallery is\r\ntreated and managed as something distinct from \"a museum.\" The\r\ndistinction is recognised in London, where we have as separate\r\ninstitutions the British Museum and the National Gallery. Probably the\r\ndistinct method of exhibiting and caring for pictures, and the very\r\nlarge amount of special knowledge connected with the reasonable\r\nemployment of public funds in the purchase of these very high-priced\r\nobjects, as well as the example of private collectors of pictures, are\r\nthe causes which have led in the past to the complete separation of\r\n\"picture galleries\" from \"museums.\" It is, however, a curious fact\r\nthat the British Museum (which once possessed some oil paintings, now\r\nremoved to other public galleries) retains and expends money on its\r\nsplendid collections of water-colour pictures, drawings, and\r\nengravings, whilst in the latter half of the last century (in\r\nopposition to the custom of separating pictures from other museum\r\nobjects) there grew up in London, under the State Department of\r\nEducation, a vast collection of all kinds of works of art (pottery,\r\nfurniture, lace, metal-work, etc.) of all countries and ages,\r\nincluding pictures, which is now sumptuously housed in the Victoria\r\nand Albert Museum.\r\n\r\nThough I propose to write here with special reference to \"museums,\" in\r\nthe more limited sense as repositories of objects which are the bases\r\nof our knowledge of the history of man and his arts, and as the\r\nstorehouses of specimens which in the same way are the material by the\r\nstudy of which we arrive at a knowledge of the history of the earth,\r\nand of the living things which have existed, and of others which still\r\nexist on its surface--yet it is obvious that the general purposes of\r\nall collections of interesting objects (including even pictures) and\r\ntheir arrangement for public use and benefit must be the same,\r\nalthough there are special purposes in view in regard to some\r\ncollections which do not exist in regard to others. Not long since Mr.\r\nClaude Phillips ably set forth some of the principles which should\r\nguide the arrangement and exhibition of objects in an art museum, and\r\ncriticised the plan at present adopted in the Victoria and Albert\r\nMuseum. As I hold views in regard to the arrangement of natural\r\nhistory museums which are very similar to his, I think it may be\r\nuseful to explain here what they are.\r\n\r\nI may point out that nearly every branch of knowledge should have--in\r\na civilised well-provided community--its collection of material\r\nobjects, either specimens, models, or ancient examples and remains,\r\nwhich should be \"records\" to be religiously preserved for future\r\nreference and comparison by expert students, whilst others should be\r\nthere to serve as demonstrations of \"great\" facts of nature or of\r\nhuman art--direct and straightforward appeals--to the ordinary\r\nintelligent (but not specially learned) man. You might well have (what\r\ndoes not at present exist!) a museum (in the modern sense) of\r\nastronomy, containing models of the solar system showing the relative\r\ndistances and sizes of the heavenly bodies--as well as modern and\r\nancient astronomical instruments, and the records obtained by their\r\nuse. Again, you might have (and to some extent such museums exist), at\r\nthe other end of the scale in dignity and age, a museum illustrating\r\nthe history and present developments of the smelting of iron and other\r\nmetals, their purification, their alloying, and properties--as also a\r\nmuseum of paper-making and one of the steam engine and its modern\r\nrivals. In such cases the purpose of the museum would be plain enough\r\nand comparatively easy to carry out.\r\n\r\nMost museums which have come into existence within the last 200 years\r\nsuffer from the fact that they are mere enlargements of the ancient\r\ncollector's \"cabinet of rare and curious things,\" brought together and\r\narranged without rhyme or reason. No one has ever attempted to say\r\nwhat is precisely the aim and intention as a public enterprise of any\r\nof our great museums, and accordingly there has been no consideration,\r\ndiscussion, or agreement as to the methods of collection, selection,\r\narrangement, exhibition, and storage of the objects assembled within\r\ntheir walls. Thousands, even millions of pounds, have been expended on\r\nthe building of museums, on the purchase of specimens, on cases and\r\ncataloguing, and on the salaries of directors, and keepers, and\r\nassistants, yet the museums remain, so far as any declaration of\r\npurpose and principle is concerned, mere \"repositories,\" as in the\r\nwords of the old Act of Parliament constituting the British\r\nMuseum--for the use and enjoyment of the public, it is true, but\r\nwithout any expression of a conception of how that use and enjoyment\r\nis to be limited so as to make them something better than a dime-show,\r\nor how any serious purpose is to be achieved by their costly housing\r\nand up-keep. No doubt various directors and keepers have from time to\r\ntime shown intelligence and laboured to make museums not only places\r\nof enjoyment and \"edification,\" but also the means of increasing\r\nknowledge and rendering service to the State. But the scope of our\r\npublic museums, and the principles and methods by which it may be\r\nrealised, have never been agreed upon, and consequently are not\r\ndefinitely recognised by the State nor by the curiously ill-chosen\r\ncommittees of managers, or trustees, to whose tender mercies the\r\nultimate control of these institutions is confided--apparently by\r\nhaphazard or misapprehension.\r\n\r\nThe notion of a town corporation, or of the central government at this\r\nor that date, has been that museums are best controlled and public\r\nmoney expended in connection with them by persons who know nothing\r\nabout the real importance of the collections, and receive no guidance\r\nfrom any scheme or statutable declaration of specific purpose drawn up\r\nby a competent authority. I will endeavour to state what those\r\npurposes should be.\r\n\r\nWhen one tries to estimate what is really the value to the community\r\nof public \"museums,\" one is led inevitably to the conclusion that\r\ntheir most important purpose--whether they are museums of natural\r\nhistory, of antiquities, or of art--is to serve as safe and permanent\r\n\"repositories\" (the old word used in the British Museum Act of 1753)\r\nfor specimens which are costly and difficult to obtain--not to be\r\neither \"picked up\" or readily \"housed\" by everybody, and at the same\r\ntime of real importance as \"records.\" The first and most commanding\r\nduty of those who set up and maintain a public museum is to preserve\r\nactual things as records--records of the existence in this or that\r\nlocality of each kind of plant and animal, records of the former\r\nexistence of extinct plants and animals, with irrefragable certainty\r\nas to the locality and the exact strata in which they were\r\nfound--records of prehistoric man, his weapons and art, and of the\r\nanimals found with them, records of modern times. Everyone is familiar\r\nwith this duty of the State and of local public bodies, when it is a\r\nmatter of preserving written and printed records. They are preserved\r\nin various public offices and libraries, and are continually being\r\nstudied by experts (volunteers or official) and copied in print, so as\r\nto furnish us with accurate knowledge of the past.\r\n\r\nIt is the first and leading business of museums to collect and\r\npreserve, with great accuracy as to the locality and circumstances in\r\nwhich each was found, the actual concrete things which are the records\r\nof nature, and of the various stages of man's art and industries in\r\nevery region of the world, just as a library or the Record Office\r\npreserves manuscripts and printed documents and books. Collections of\r\nsuch specimens are often made by private individuals, and become too\r\ncumbersome for him or his heirs to keep in order. They are then\r\nfrequently given to a public museum, and I regret to say in many\r\nprovincial museums are neglected and become mere rubbish, even if they\r\nwere not so when first given. Often such gifts are rubbish before they\r\nare received, and should never have been accepted. But in a great many\r\ninstances the local museum of a country town is nothing but a\r\nrubbish-heap, because the townspeople will not spend the money\r\nnecessary to obtain the services of a capable curator and to provide\r\ncases, labels, catalogues, and attendance. The town councillors\r\nusually know nothing about the museum or the value of the objects\r\ngathered there, and do not recognise the duty of making it an orderly\r\nand carefully tended storehouse of the records of Nature and antiquity\r\nof the neighbourhood. Too frequently the town museum is made the means\r\nof gratifying the vanity of some local collector, who hands over all\r\nsorts of ill-chosen, badly preserved specimens to its ignorant\r\nguardians, and is advertised by labels on the cases and by votes of\r\nthanks, whilst valuable records placed there in a previous generation\r\nare swept into a corner or broken and cast into the cellar in order to\r\nmake space for the new rubbish!\r\n\r\nUnless funds are found to place a specially educated man at the head\r\nof a local museum, the museum had better be shut, and such of its\r\ncontents, as may be desired, offered to one of the big city museums or\r\nto the National Museum in London. It is no child's play, maintaining\r\nand guarding efficiently a museum which contains \"records.\" It would\r\nbe a good thing were a committee of naturalists and antiquaries to\r\nvisit the local museums of the United Kingdom and report on the\r\nefficiency of their guardianship and the state of the treasures which\r\nthey contain. I know two provincial museums very well in which\r\nextremely valuable records of prehistoric man and of wonderful extinct\r\nanimals--found in the neighbourhood and preserved by those who\r\nestablished the museums fifty years ago--are utterly neglected and\r\ndestroyed by loss of the labels and mixing up of the specimens, in\r\nconsequence of the death of the persons originally interested in the\r\nmuseum and of the refusal of the town councils to find money to pay\r\nfor the care of the collections. There can be little doubt that in the\r\npresent state of local interest in such matters all really important\r\nrecord specimens should find their way to the British Museum in\r\nLondon, where, if accepted, their preservation, so far as it is\r\nhumanly possible, is assured. That is the distinctive and most\r\ncreditable feature of our great State-supported museum. At the same\r\ntime it seems obvious that the records of a provincial area can be,\r\nand should be, kept in the county town museum, with a detail and\r\ncompleteness impossible elsewhere, and that it should be the pride of\r\nthe county to be able to show to a stranger full records of the\r\ndistinctive features of its natural history and antiquities.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that whatever failures in this respect may be inevitable\r\nin those hopelessly starved and mismanaged \"museums\" at present\r\nsurviving to bear witness to the decay of public spirit and\r\nintelligent culture in our country towns, the prime duty of the great\r\nLondon museum is to preserve \"records\" with the greatest nicety and\r\nreadiness for reference, whilst the duty of actively adding to these\r\nrecords from all parts of the Empire, and, therefore, of the world,\r\nand that of minutely studying and reporting upon the collections so\r\nobtained and guarded, follow as a matter of course. These collections\r\nare the absolutely necessary foundation for the building-up of our\r\nknowledge of Nature and of man. We can never say that this branch of\r\nscientific knowledge is valuable and that another is a mere fanciful\r\npursuit. Every year it becomes more and more clear that unexpectedly\r\nsome apparently insignificant piece of detailed scientific knowledge\r\nmay become of value to the State and to humanity at large. Everyone\r\nknows that geology has a great practical value in mining, water\r\nsupply, and various kinds of engineering, also that botany, as\r\nrepresented by the great State institution at Kew, is of immense\r\nvalue to those who introduce useful plants from one part of the\r\nworld for cultivation in another. But of late we have seen that\r\nentomology--\"bug-hunting\" as it is scornfully termed--is a science\r\nupon which hang not only the revenue of an Empire, but also the lives\r\nof millions of men. Destructive insects must be known with the utmost\r\naccuracy in order to stop their injury to crops in the distant lands\r\nwhich they inhabit, and also in order to check the diseases carried by\r\nthem which sweep off vast herds of costly cattle. The mosquitoes and\r\nthe tsetze flies have been, only recently, proved to be the causes,\r\nthe carriers, of diseases--malaria, yellow fever, and sleeping\r\nsickness--which annually have killed hundreds of thousands of men,\r\ncolonists as well as natives. I was able to bring together at the\r\nNatural History Museum collections of mosquitoes from every part of\r\nthe world, amounting to thousands of specimens and to some hundreds of\r\nkinds. The study of these and of the tsetze flies by skilled\r\nentomologists employed in the museum has been a necessary part of the\r\nsteps now being taken everywhere to preserve human population from\r\nthe attacks of certain deadly kinds among them, distinguished from\r\nthe others which are harmless.\r\n\r\nThus, then, it seems that the first and most important purpose for\r\nwhich great \"museums\" exist is that of \"the making of new\r\nknowledge\"--the increase of science--by furnishing carefully gathered\r\nand preserved \"specimens\" of all kinds, and by working out the history\r\nand significance of those collections. But there is a second and\r\ndistinct purpose which is often ignorantly put in the first place. It\r\nis of less importance and quite unlike the first in the methods\r\nnecessary for its attainment, and yet is conveniently and\r\nsatisfactorily carried out in conjunction with the first. This second\r\nand distinct purpose is the exhibition of such portions of the\r\ncollections in a museum as are suitable for exhibition (only a smaller\r\nportion are so) in public galleries, so chosen, arranged, lighted and\r\nlabelled as to afford to the public at large the maximum of enjoyment\r\nand edification. This is, as it were, a readily accessible enjoyment\r\ngiven to the public in recognition of the large sums of public money\r\nexpended on the severer and less easily appreciated enterprise of the\r\nmuseum. The public galleries of a museum, whether of natural history,\r\nantiquities or art, should not contain the bulk of the collection, but\r\nonly special things, carefully selected, and equally carefully placed\r\nin case or on wall, with artistic judgment as to space-bordering and\r\ncolour of background, and with scientific perfection of illumination,\r\nso as to produce the \"just\" impression on the leisurely visitor. The\r\npublic \"exhibit\" should be arranged so as to draw attention to a\r\nseries of important facts of structure or quality clearly shown by the\r\nspecimens, whether they are natural products or works of art, and\r\nthese facts should be described in printed labels fully, and the\r\nreason for attaching importance to them explained at sufficient\r\nlength. The man who arranges the public galleries (as distinct from\r\nthe closed study-rooms) of a public museum, should have a special gift\r\nof exposition in plain language, and be able to separate (both in\r\nregard to his words and to the specimens he selects) the essential\r\nfrom the non-essential, the significant from the redundant.\r\n\r\nIt is important to make a complete distinction between an exhibition\r\nintended for the general public and that intended for advanced\r\nstudents in schools, colleges and universities. The confusion of these\r\ntwo kinds of exhibition is the cause of the failure of many museums\r\nand of the dislike with which most people regard a visit to them. The\r\npublic museum--metropolitan or local--should not include in its\r\npurpose the \"academic\" instruction of schoolboys and university\r\nstudents. That requires a different kind of museum, which is (or\r\nshould be) provided by the school or university, though, of course,\r\nthe students should also visit the more popular museums. The funds and\r\nstaff and space required for the one are not sufficient for both. If\r\nboth are attempted, the unpopular academic, or scholars', exhibition\r\nwill get the upper hand and suppress the other, since it is a far\r\neasier thing to carry out successfully (for the class aimed at) than\r\nis the carefully planned exhibition intended for the \"edification\" of\r\nthe greater public. The university museum aims at imparting a much\r\ngreater amount of detailed and elaborate information than does the\r\ngreat public museum, and requires from the student who uses it a\r\nspecial previous study of the subject, and an exceptional amount of\r\nattention and pains in examining the objects exhibited.\r\n\r\nToo many of the public museums of Europe aim at the \"instruction\" of\r\nthe special student rather than at the \"edification\" of the general\r\npublic, whilst most aim at nothing at all except showing, without\r\nexplanation or comment, a vast mass of specimens or pictures, at the\r\nsight of which the patient but bored public gapes with wonder. The\r\npublic galleries of the Natural History Museum in London have been\r\narranged more distinctly with a view to the edification of the public\r\nthan those of any other museum which I know. But they still contain\r\ntoo large a number of specimens, and still require an immense amount\r\nof work in weeding, selection and labelling, and in deliberately\r\nmaking the specimens exhibited tell a tale which is worth remembering,\r\nand can be remembered. Except in the case of the larger specimens, and\r\nespecially those of fossilized skeletons and shells of extinct\r\nanimals, it must be remembered that the bulk of the specimens (and,\r\nindeed, all the valuable skins of animals and birds, and the vast\r\nseries of insects and such small things) in that, as in every other\r\nlarge museum, are contained in cabinets protected from the destructive\r\naction of light, and arranged for the most part in rooms to which\r\naccess is obtained only by serious workers after special application.\r\nThe fishes and other animals preserved in alcohol are kept in a\r\nspecial fire-proof \"spirit-building.\"\r\n\r\nA provincial public museum, even if it does not aim at the\r\nguardianship of important local \"records\" of natural history and\r\nantiquity, should aim at the edification of the public--the grown-up\r\npublic--and not at the instruction of school children. The notion that\r\nmuseums are meant for children, which exists, I am sorry to say, even\r\nin regard to so splendid and expensive a display of wonderful things\r\nas that to be seen at the Natural History Museum, is due to the bad\r\ntradition justified by the condition of other museums, where a child\r\nmay enjoy being astonished, but a grown-up person can take in nothing\r\nwhich appeals to the intelligence. A new city museum is, it is\r\nreported, to be established at Birmingham. We may hope that it will\r\nnot contain the usual unsatisfactory series of badly stuffed exotic\r\nanimals, birds, and reptiles, and trophies of South Sea islanders'\r\nclubs and spears. It should contain first-rate specimens of the living\r\nand extinct fauna of Warwickshire, and specimens of foreign animals\r\ncarefully selected to compare with them and throw light on them; also\r\nlocal prehistoric and antiquarian specimens, illustrated by comparison\r\nwith the work of savage and remote races. The excellent suggestion has\r\nbeen made that it should contain specimens of the insect-pests of\r\nWarwickshire crops. It should also exhibit the minerals from which\r\nmanufactories of Birmingham draw their metals, and should show the\r\nstages of their preparation. It should appeal, not to the boys and\r\ngirls of Birmingham in the first place, but to the adults, and to do\r\nthis it should be placed under the care of a really first-rate and\r\ningenious man, who might possibly do for the Birmingham Museum what\r\nskilful arrangement and sound knowledge have done for its Art\r\nGallery--an institution intended to appeal not to school children, but\r\nto the reasonable adult population of the city.\r\n\r\nThe principle of exhibiting permanently in public galleries a portion\r\nof our great national collections and of preserving another and larger\r\nportion in smaller rooms, where they can be more closely but not less\r\ncarefully disposed and brought out into perfect light and position\r\nwhen required, should be applied to collections of pottery,\r\nmetal-work, carving, embroidery and such objects, and also to pictures\r\nas well as to collections relating to natural history. The chief\r\nreason for this is the enormous space required in order to place\r\npermanently \"on exhibition\" all the objects contained in our national\r\nart collections, which are continually growing. The vast size of the\r\ngalleries required, if the entire collections are to be exhibited so\r\nthat the public may walk in and see anything and everything in it,\r\npermanently displayed on walls or in cases--entails gigantic and\r\never-increasing expenditure of public funds.\r\n\r\nBut this is not the only objection to these great galleries. The\r\nmultitude of objects--it may be of pictures--exhibited creates a state\r\nof mind in the visitor which prevents his enjoyment of the works of\r\nart so exhibited. He is overwhelmed by the vastness of the series\r\noffered for his examination and confused and distressed by the close\r\nsetting of things which require isolation and appropriate surroundings\r\neach in its own special way, if they are to be duly appreciated. Not\r\nonly this, but pictures, as well as other works of art, are, in\r\nconsequence of the necessity of placing them all in the great public\r\ngalleries used for the purpose, rarely placed in the most favourable\r\nconditions of lighting, and are very often so ill-lighted as to lose\r\nall their beauty even if they are not nearly invisible. More public\r\nmoney would be available for the proper care and study of works of art\r\nwere less spent on the land, building and up-keep necessary for huge\r\ngalleries.\r\n\r\nThe desirability of separating a large unexhibited portion from the\r\nwell-chosen and well-shown exhibited portion of works of art,\r\nexclusive of pictures, is, I believe, generally admitted. In the case\r\nof pictures the opinion has been expressed that there would be great\r\ndifficulty in managing a reserved unexhibited portion of our national\r\ncollections so that the pictures could be properly cared for and yet\r\nreadily brought into view when required. One can well believe that a\r\nsimilar difficulty was anticipated when it was first proposed to keep\r\nbooks on shelves instead of on tables. Those who take this objection\r\nhave overlooked the resources of modern engineering. Reserved pictures\r\ncould be affixed in perfect security in appropriate groups on large\r\nscreens, and these disposed, like the scenery above a stage, upright\r\nand in series, each screen 4 ft. distant from its neighbours. There\r\ncould be three or four floors of such closely packed screens arranged\r\nin two rows, twenty in a row. On a lower floor there would be provided\r\na room with the most perfect light possible for seeing, enjoying and\r\nstudying a single one of these screens. They would all be numbered and\r\nthe pictures on each catalogued. A person duly authorised and approved\r\ndesires to see such and such a picture. He is given a seat in the\r\nspecial exhibition room. The attendant or assistant in charge touches\r\nthe appropriate button, and by simple electric-lift machinery the\r\nscreen upstairs carrying the desired picture travels automatically\r\ninto position and then gently descends into the special exhibition\r\nroom. There the other pictures on the screen may be, if it be so\r\ndesired, covered by drapery, the light may be varied in intensity or\r\ndirection, and, in fact, the most perfect examination of the picture\r\nin question may be made. When another button is touched, the\r\npicture-screen returns automatically to its place upstairs.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that in the case of the growing collection of pictures\r\nknown as \"The National Portrait Gallery,\" this treatment would not\r\nonly avoid the necessity of constantly providing new galleries for new\r\nacquisitions--but would enable the Trustees to separate those\r\nportraits, which are of more general interest and suitable for\r\npermanent exhibition in a good position, from less important\r\nportraits, which nevertheless must be acquired and preserved as public\r\nrecords. From time to time special groups of the reserved or\r\nunexhibited portraits might be put for six months in one of the public\r\nrooms--thus providing a change and variety of interest for the general\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nThe same plan might be adopted with regard to the pictures in the\r\nNational Gallery--though no doubt a large number of splendid pictures\r\nwould be permanently placed in the exhibition rooms. Three things\r\nshould be remembered in regard to the disposal of these pictures:\r\nFirstly, that not one in a hundred among them was intended by the\r\npainter to be hung in a gallery closely side by side with other\r\npictures; secondly, that no picture should be exhibited in a public\r\ngallery unless it is worthy of the best lighting and surroundings;\r\nthirdly, that it is reasonable that the expert and the student should\r\nbe asked to take some special trouble in order to see special pictures\r\nnot on public exhibition, and that \"the man in the street\" who says\r\nthat he likes to walk in and see all his pictures at any time and\r\nwithout any trouble, will value his collection more when he can only\r\nsee some of it on special occasions.\r\n\r\nThe heavy and sometimes fragile character of the \"frames\" affixed to\r\nlarge pictures has been made an objection to the proposal that they\r\nshould be fixed to screens moved by electric gear. I cannot venture to\r\ndiscuss the subject of picture frames here. I am aware that it is a\r\nvery serious and important subject, and that a great deal of the\r\neffect of a picture depends on its being bordered by a frame of\r\nsufficient size and dignity and one which is really and artistically\r\nfitted to allow the finer qualities of the picture to become apparent.\r\nHow often is such a frame seen? Who is there who has an adequate\r\nunderstanding of picture-frames as adjuncts to, or necessary\r\naccompaniments of, great pictures? The splendid carved and gilded\r\nwooden frames of some great pictures have a value of their own as\r\nexamples of design. But how many of them are really suited to the\r\npicture which they surround? How much attention has been given by art\r\nexperts to the question of the best possible \"exhibitional\"\r\nsurroundings--nearer and more distant--for this, that and the other,\r\namong the great pictures of Europe?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nTHE SECRET OF A TERRIBLE DISEASE\r\n\r\n\r\nThis generation, which is so thankless to the great discoverers of the\r\ncauses of disease, so forgetful of the epoch-making labours of the\r\nEnglish sanitary reformers of last century, has not seen nor even\r\nheard of the awful thing once known as \"gaol-fever.\" A hundred years\r\nago it was as dangerous to the life of an unhappy prisoner to await\r\nhis trial in Newgate as to stand between the opposing forces on a\r\nbattlefield. Gaol-fever attacked not only the prisoners, but the judge\r\nand the jury and the strangers in the court. The aromatic herbs with\r\nwhich the hall of justice was strewn were supposed to arrest the\r\nspread of the terrible infection, and it is still customary to provide\r\nwith a bouquet of such plants the judge who presides at a \"gaol\r\ndelivery.\" The inexorable ministers of justice, who, seated high above\r\nthe common herd, and clad in their ancient robes of office, were about\r\nto deal shameful death to the guilty wretches brought from the prison\r\ncells, were often themselves struck down by the Angel of Death moving\r\ninvisibly through the court. The \"black assizes\" were not isolated,\r\nbut repeated occurrences in our great cities. Typhus fever was the\r\nname given by the learned to this awful pestilence. There was a\r\nmystery and horror surrounding it which paralysed those who came into\r\ncontact with it, and produced something like consternation. Men fled\r\nin terror from the infected buildings, business was arrested, the\r\nuniversities deserted, palaces left empty, and the dying abandoned to\r\ntheir misery when it appeared. There was a feeling that some deadly\r\nunseen power was present, irresistible and malignant.\r\n\r\nIt is only to-day--in fact, within the last two years--that we have\r\nlearnt what that unseen power was. The Angel of Death which moved\r\nthrough the Old Bailey Sessions House in bygone days was, indeed, a\r\nliving thing. It passed silently and unseen from the prisoner to the\r\nwarder, from him to the usher, thence to the bar--the jury and the\r\nexalted judge. It had no wings, yet it moved slowly and surely\r\ncarrying black death with it. This terrible and mysterious assassin\r\nhas at last been unveiled. The shroud of concealment has been torn\r\naway and there the dire monster stands--naked, remorseless and\r\nhideous. It is of small size, though it makes us all shrink with\r\nhorror and disgust. It has six claw-like legs and no wings. It is, in\r\nfact, neither more nor less than the clothes louse, the _Pediculus\r\nvestimenti_. The filthy, crowded condition in which the prisoners were\r\nkept, and (let us well remember and reflect thereon) the personal want\r\nof cleanliness of judge, jury, barristers and ushers, rendered the\r\nexistence of the little parasite and its effective transference from\r\nman to man possible. Those pompous emblems of authority, the horsehair\r\nwigs--those musty robes of unctuous dignity--were full of dirt, and\r\nharboured the wandering bearer of typhus infection. Gaol-fever was due\r\nto dirt; its infecting germs were distributed by loathsome insects.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting and really instructive thing to pass in review\r\nthe gradual process by which the cleanliness of the population of\r\nWestern Europe has advanced, and to observe that, consciously or\r\nunconsciously, the end pursued has been, step by step, the removal\r\nfrom man's body outside (and inside), from his clothing, from the\r\nwater he drinks, from the food he eats, from the air he breathes, and\r\nfrom the surfaces with which he necessarily comes into contact,\r\nof injurious parasites and hurtful living things which lurk\r\nin dirt and rubbish. At first the larger and more obvious hurtful\r\ncreatures--snakes, rats, mice, scorpions, blow-flies--were eliminated\r\nby some elementary attempts at removal of rubbish and kitchen\r\nmiddens. Then ticks (which African savages still do not trouble to\r\nremove from their bodies) and later fleas and bugs became unpopular;\r\nlice were long regarded as inevitable, and even beneficial, and by\r\nsome populations and by part of the most civilised at the present day,\r\nare still, not merely tolerated, but favoured. In a country school in\r\nFrance a child who was found to be afflicted in this way was the\r\ndaughter of the local medical practitioner. She remarked, \"Oh! Ce\r\nn'est rien; papa dit que c'est la santé des enfants\"! Parasitic worms\r\nof various kinds, though they often cause disease and death, are\r\naccepted and tolerated even by the most refined and luxurious, who\r\nrisk infection rather than submit to the precaution of abstention from\r\nraw vegetables and fruits, or to the expenditure of trouble in\r\ncleansing those nests of infective germs. It is only within the last\r\nthirty or forty years that such cleanliness of body and of clothing\r\nand of house-fittings as will banish parasitic insects has become at\r\nall general. The common house-fly is still tolerated, although it is a\r\nnotorious carrier of dirt and disease, and is bred by dirt and dirt\r\nonly, its eggs being hatched in old stable manure. The diminution of\r\nlate years of house-flies in London houses is simply and solely due to\r\nlegislation compelling the removal of horse manure from the \"mews\" so\r\nfrequent at the back of London streets. Egyptian natives still allow\r\nflies to gather on their eyelids without protest.\r\n\r\nOf the bacteria and similar microscopic germs of disease--to which all\r\nour infective fevers are due--we have only become aware quite\r\nrecently, within the half-century. Before they were known, cleanliness\r\nand the destruction of putrescible matter in man's surroundings had,\r\nit is true, been urged by sanitary reformers. Disinfectants and\r\nantiseptics were deliberately made use of for this purpose in the\r\nmid-Victorian period, when carbolic acid and chlorinated lime were\r\nestablished in the place of those feebler destroyers of the germs of\r\nputrefaction and disease--namely, the extracts of aromatic herbs or\r\nthe essential oils themselves. These, as perfumes and unguents, really\r\nserved, not merely to gratify the olfactory sense, but to destroy by\r\ntheir chemical action the germs of disease. Men tolerated gnats and\r\ntheir bites (mosquitoes as we prefer to call them in order to delude\r\nourselves into the belief that they are not British) until it was\r\ndiscovered that they, and they only, carry the parasitic germs of two\r\ndeadly diseases--malaria, or ague, and yellow fever. Now we shall\r\ndestroy the pools in which they breed, just as we are destroying the\r\nmanure heaps in which the house-fly breeds. When we look over the list\r\nit is really astonishing how much remains to be done, even in England,\r\nin establishing increased cleanliness and freeing ourselves from the\r\nmurderous tyranny of parasites. It is a simple but horrible fact that\r\nthe poorest class in our big cities still swarms with vermin. And not\r\nonly are the poor in great cities thus afflicted. The recent\r\ncompulsory medical inspection of school children has shown that in\r\nsome of the smiling rural districts of England 80 per cent. of the\r\nchildren have lice in their heads. Everyone should help to gain\r\nfurther cleanliness and freedom from this form of oppression.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the nineteenth century, England alone, and with\r\nabsolute conviction and determination, demonstrated to the civilised\r\nworld the beneficial results in diminishing the death-rate of large\r\ntowns, to be obtained by cleanliness, the destruction or removal from\r\nman's body and surroundings of organic \"dirt,\" viz. his excreta, the\r\nexudations and exuviations of his body, the waste and fragments of his\r\nfood. The names of Rawlinson, Chadwick and Simon remain as those of\r\nthe prime movers in that legislation which has given us improved water\r\nsupply, sewerage, removal of dust heaps, clearance of cesspits,\r\ncleansing of houses, and prevention of over-crowding. Yet there are\r\nwriters who, in ignorance and infected with the modern madness which\r\nmakes half-educated Englishmen presume to teach where they have yet to\r\nlearn, and to pose as prophets by belittling and running down,\r\nwithout regard to truth, their own country and its finest efforts in\r\nthe cause of civilisation, actually declare that Germany has led the\r\nway in this matter. This is the very reverse of the truth. Foreign\r\ncountries are, in this matter, following long in the wake of England.\r\nThere are no cities in the world so healthy as British cities.\r\nPractical measures of cleansing, faithful activity in destroying dirt\r\nand preventing over-crowding, enforced by legislation, have reduced\r\nthe death-rate of our great centres of population in fifty years by\r\nmore than one third--that is to say, from something like 29 per 1,000\r\nto something like 18 per 1,000. No other country can show such a\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nGaol-fever, spotted or putrid fever, or typhus fever has practically\r\nceased to be a regularly occurring disease in the West of Europe. The\r\nlast cases in London were, I well remember, in a poor district near\r\nthe Marylebone Road about thirty years ago. A very few cases have\r\nappeared since, in the over-crowded and poorest districts of our\r\nlargest cities. Beleaguering armies and beleaguered cities suffered\r\nfrom it as late as in the Crimean War, but we may now fairly say that\r\nit has disappeared from our midst. It, however, still abounds in\r\nRussia and her eastern provinces, and in Algeria, Tunis, and Morocco.\r\nIt is a disease of cold and temperate climates rather than of the\r\ntropics.\r\n\r\nIn the last century typhus was distinguished definitely and clearly\r\nfrom \"typhoid\" or \"enteric\" fever, and from \"relapsing\" or \"famine\"\r\nfever, with which it had previously been confounded. The bacterial\r\ngerms causing enteric and relapsing fevers are now known, and have\r\nbeen isolated and cultivated, and the mode in which they are conveyed\r\ninto the body of a previously healthy patient is ascertained. But\r\nuntil the past year we knew neither the parasitic germ which causes\r\ntyphus fever nor the mode by which it passes from one individual to\r\nanother. A vague idea that it was spread through the air prevailed.\r\nTyphus is remarkable for the frequency with which the nurses and\r\ndoctors attending a case become infected. About 20 per cent. of those\r\nattacked by it die, but in persons above forty-five years of age the\r\nmortality is much greater--about half succumb.\r\n\r\nDr. Nicole and his colleagues of the Institut Pasteur in Tunis have\r\nrecently had the opportunity of studying typhus there. They found that\r\nthe ordinary local monkey could not be made to take the disease. But a\r\ndrop of blood of a typhus patient injected into a chimpanzee (which is\r\nfar nearer akin to man) produced the disease after an incubation\r\nperiod of three weeks. This fact was definitely established. From what\r\nis now known as to relapsing fever, malaria, yellow fever, plague, and\r\nsleeping-sickness, it seemed probable that some migratory insect must\r\nbe the carrier of the typhus infection from man to man. The typhus\r\npatients brought into the hospital at Tunis were carefully washed\r\nbefore admission, and no infection of other patients or nurses took\r\nplace in the wards, although the cases were not isolated, and bugs\r\nwere abundant. The only cases of infection which occurred were in\r\npersons who had the duty of collecting and disinfecting the clothing\r\nof the patients when admitted. This seems to exclude the bug as a\r\ncarrier. The flea is excluded by the fact that in the phosphate mines\r\nof Tunis the flea is abundant, and bites both natives and Europeans.\r\nYet when typhus fever broke out among the miners--although all were\r\nequally bitten by the fleas--no European was infected. The indication,\r\ntherefore, was that if any insect is the carrier, it is neither the\r\nflea nor the bug, but probably the clothes-louse. Although the smaller\r\nmonkeys cannot be directly infected with typhus fever from man, it was\r\nfound that (as with some other infections) the bonnet monkey was\r\nsusceptible to the infection after it had passed through the\r\nchimpanzee. Experiments were, therefore, made with clothes lice taken\r\nfrom a healthy man, and kept for eight hours without food. They were\r\nplaced on a bonnet monkey which was in full typhus eruption. A day\r\nafterwards they were removed to healthy bonnet monkeys with the\r\nresult that the healthy bonnet monkeys developed typhus fever. There\r\nis thus no doubt whatever that typhus fever can be carried in this way\r\nfrom bonnet monkey to bonnet monkey. The whole history of typhus fever\r\nfits in with the carriage of the infection in the same way from man to\r\nman, and not with the notion of an aërial dispersion of the infection.\r\n\r\nThe fact that typhus only exists in very dirty and crowded\r\npopulations, and that it has disappeared where even a moderate amount\r\nof cleanliness as to person and clothing has become general, coincides\r\nwith the possibility of the body louse as carrier. This little\r\nparasite is known to be a wanderer, and is gifted with a very acute\r\nsense of smell. An individual placed in the centre of a glass table\r\ninvariably walked, guided by the scent, towards the observer, at\r\nwhatever position he placed himself. Sulphurous acid is a violent\r\nrepellant of these creatures. Not only will it kill them if they are\r\nexposed to its fumes, but traces of it drive them away. Hence doctors\r\nand nurses who have to handle typhus patients or their clothes have\r\nonly to wear a small muslin bag of sulphur under their garments, or to\r\nrub themselves with a little sulphur ointment in order to be perfectly\r\nguarded against infection; the louse will not approach them, nor\r\nremain upon them should it accidentally effect a lodgment.\r\n\r\nIt is not always obvious at once in what way a knowledge of the mode\r\nof carriage of a deadly disease can be of service to humanity. But in\r\nthis case it is strikingly and triumphantly clear. In the vast\r\npoverty-stricken population of Russia typhus is still common. Public\r\nmedical officials attend these cases, and the Russian Government keeps\r\na record of the annual deaths of its medical staff, and of the causes\r\nof their deaths. In the first six months of last year 530 Russian\r\nmedical officers died, and twenty-four of these deaths were caused by\r\ntyphus fever acquired by these devoted public servants in attendance\r\nupon cases of that fever. Henceforth they will make use of sulphur or\r\nsulphurous ointment to keep the little infection-carriers at a\r\ndistance, and not one medical man or nurse will catch the disease,\r\nstill less be killed by it.\r\n\r\nA remarkable fact in this history is that the actual parasitic germ\r\nwhich causes typhus, whether a bacterium (Schizophyte) or a protozoon,\r\nhas not been detected, although the louse has been shown to be its\r\n\"carrier.\" The same is true of yellow-fever: we have not seen with the\r\nmicroscope the microbe which produces it. But we know with certainty\r\nthat the gnat, _Stegomya fasciata_, and no other, is the carrier of\r\nthe unseen germ, and that we can obliterate that fever by obliterating\r\nthe gnat. So, too, although we know how the infection of rabies acts,\r\nand how it is carried, yet no one has yet isolated and recognised the\r\nterrible infective particle itself. There is a very high probability\r\nthat in these cases, and also in cancer (where as yet no specific\r\ninfective germ or parasitic microbe has been detected), such an\r\ninfective microbe is nevertheless present, and has hitherto escaped\r\nobservation with the microscope on account of its excessive minuteness\r\nand transparency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nCARRIERS OF DISEASE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has now been discovered that a great number of human diseases are\r\ncaused by microscopic parasites, which are spoken of in a general way\r\nby the name invented by the great Pasteur, viz. \"microbes.\"\r\nWool-sorter's disease, Eastern relapsing fever, lock-jaw, glanders,\r\nleprosy, phthisis, diphtheria, cholera, Oriental plague, typhoid\r\nfever, Malta fever, septic poisoning and gangrene have been shown to\r\nbe caused each by a peculiar species of the excessively minute\r\nparasitic vegetables known as bacteria (or Schizophyta). Others, for\r\nexample, malaria and sleeping sickness, have been shown to be caused\r\nby almost equally minute microbes, which are of an animal nature, and\r\nsimilar to the free-living animalcules which we call Protozoa, or\r\n\"simplest animals,\" whilst a third lot of diseases--rabies, smallpox,\r\nyellow fever, scarlet fever, and typhus--are held to be caused by\r\nsimilar minute parasites, although these have not yet actually been\r\nseen and cultivated, but are surely inferred (from the nature and\r\nspread of these diseases) to exist.\r\n\r\nThe difference of the microbes called bacteria from the\r\ndisease-causing microbes classed as \"Protozoa\" consists in their\r\nsimpler structure and mode of growth. They are essentially filaments\r\nwhich continually multiply by fission--a process often carried so far\r\nthat the little organisms present themselves as short rods, or as\r\ncurved (comma-shaped), or even spherical particles (micrococci)--and\r\nonly in favourable conditions arrest their self-division so as to grow\r\nfor a time into the thread-like or filament shape. Often these\r\nfilaments are not straight, but spirally twisted, and are called\r\n\"spirilla.\" Some of them are blood parasites, but the larger number\r\nattack the tissues, and others occur in the digestive canal.\r\n\r\nThe parasitic disease-producing protozoa, on the other hand, are of\r\nsofter substance, often have the habit of twisting themselves in a\r\ncorkscrew-like manner, and usually are provided with an undulating\r\nmembrane or frill, as well as with one or with two whip-like swimming\r\nprocesses (the latter are present also and are often numerous in the\r\nactively swimming phases of bacteria), and have a more complicated\r\nlife-history. They divide, as a rule, longitudinally and not\r\ntransversely, and pass from one \"host\" to a second, where they assume\r\ndistinct forms--males and females, which conjugate and break up (each\r\nconjugated or fused pair) into a mass of very numerous, excessively\r\nminute, young. The disease-producing protozoa of this kind are\r\nfrequently parasitic in the blood of man and animals, and were only\r\nrecently recognised, after the disease-producing bacteria of many\r\nkinds had been thoroughly studied. These animal microbes are often\r\nspoken of as \"blood-flagellates\" or hæmo-flagellata, and the larger\r\nkinds are called \"Trypanosomes,\" or \"screw-form parasites,\" or whilst\r\na series of more minute ones are called \"Piroplasma,\" or \"pear-shaped\r\nparasites.\" Many, but not all, are found during a certain period of\r\ntheir life, actually inside the corpuscles of the blood. The fact that\r\nmany of these blood-flagellates (if not all) have, besides their life\r\nin the blood of one species of animal, a second period of existence in\r\nthe juices or the gut of another animal, has made it very difficult to\r\ntrace their migrations, since in the second phase of their history\r\ntheir appearance differs considerably from that which they presented\r\nin the first. And often they exist in one kind of animal without doing\r\nany harm, and are only poisonous when introduced by insects into the\r\nblood of other kinds of animals!\r\n\r\nThere is, further, another set of disease-causing protozoan parasites\r\nwhich are similar to the amoeba or proteus-animalcule, and a third,\r\nwhich belong to the group of \"ciliated infusoria.\" They are not so\r\nminute as the preceding set, and are not usually referred to as\r\n\"microbes.\" They inhabit the intestine of man and animals, and cause,\r\nin some instances, dysentery. These two later kinds of protozoan\r\nparasites I will at the moment leave out of consideration, as well as\r\nthe \"coccidia,\" which multiply in the tissue-cells of animals--for\r\ninstance, rabbits and mice--and cause an unhealthy growth and\r\nexcessive multiplication of the cells of the tissues, which in some\r\nrespects resembles that seen in the terrible disease known as cancer.\r\nIndeed, it is held by many investigators that some such\r\nparasite--though not yet discovered--is the cause of cancer.\r\n\r\nA very important question is: How do these poison-producing parasites\r\n(for it is by the poison which they manufacture that they upset the\r\nhealthy life of their hosts) make their way into the human body? The\r\nsurface of the body of animals, like man, is protected by a delicate,\r\nhorny covering--the epidermis--through which none of these parasites\r\ncan make their way. They can only get through it, and so into the\r\nsoft, juicy tissues and the fine blood-vessels which it covers, when\r\nit is cracked, broken, pierced, or cut. But they also have a way to\r\nopen them through the softer moist surfaces of the inner passages,\r\nsuch as the digestive canal and the lungs. They enter (some kinds only\r\nand not a few) with food and drink into the digestive canal, and with\r\nthe air into the air-passages and the lungs; and once in these\r\nchambers, which have only soft lining-surfaces, they are able to\r\npenetrate into the substance of the body. Many of those which enter\r\nthe digestive canal do not require to penetrate further, but multiply\r\nexcessively in the contents of the bowel, and there produce poisons,\r\nwhich are absorbed and produce deadly results--such are the bacteria\r\nwhich produce Indian cholera and ordinary diarrhoea--whilst the kind\r\ncausing typhoid fever not only multiplies in the gut, but penetrates\r\nits surface.\r\n\r\nThe protective surface of man's body is broken, and the way laid open\r\nfor the entrance of microbes in various ways. A slight scratch,\r\nabrasion, or even \"chapping\" is enough. Thus, a mere breaking of the\r\nskin of the knuckles by a fall on to dirty ground lets in the deadly\r\nbacterium of lock-jaw (tetanus), which is lurking in the soil. Leprosy\r\nis communicated from a leper in the same way. The almost ubiquitous\r\nbacteria of blood-poisoning (septicæmia) may enter by the smallest\r\nfissure of the skin, still more readily by large cuts or wounds. The\r\nbites and stabs of small and large animals--wolves, dogs, flies,\r\ngnats, fleas and bugs, also open the way, and often the deadly microbe\r\nhas associated itself with the biting animal and is carried by it,\r\nready to effect an entrance. Thus rabies (hydrophobia) is introduced\r\nby the bites of wolves and dogs, and a whole series of diseases, such\r\nas plague, malaria, sleeping-sickness, gaol-fever (typhus), yellow\r\nfever, relapsing fever, and others, are introduced into the human body\r\nby blood-sucking insects. Hence the immense importance of treating\r\nevery slightest wound and scratch with chemicals (called\r\n\"antiseptics\"), which at once destroy the invading microbe--and of\r\nkeeping a wounded surface covered and protected from their approach.\r\nIn ways at one time unsuspected, such openings may be made by which\r\npoisonous microbes enter the body. Thus the little hard-skinned\r\nparasitic thread-worms which are often brought in by uncooked food\r\ninto man's intestine, though by themselves comparatively harmless,\r\nscratch the soft lining of the bowel and enable poison-making microbes\r\nto enter the deeper tissues, and cause dangerous abscesses and\r\nappendicitis.\r\n\r\nThe carriers of disease germs thus become a very important subject of\r\nstudy. There are carriers which make no selection, but are, so to\r\nspeak, \"casual\" in their proceedings, and there are others which have\r\nthe most special and elaborate relations to some one kind of\r\ndisease-causing microbe for which alone they are responsible, and to\r\nthe life of which they are necessary. Let us look first at the more\r\ncasual group. Man himself is a great carrier and distributor of his\r\nown diseases. Unless and until he has learned to be careful and guard\r\nagainst thoughtless proceedings, he is always spreading the microbes\r\nof his diseases and passing them on to his fellow men. He pollutes the\r\nwaters, rivers, lakes, and pools from which others drink. He manures\r\nhis crops, and then eats some of them uncooked. His hands are polluted\r\nby disease-causing microbes, and he handles (to an alarming and\r\nunnecessary extent) the food, such as bread and fruit, which is\r\nswallowed by his fellows, without cleansing it by heat. It has lately\r\nbeen shown that apparently healthy men and women often harbour within\r\nthem the microbes of typhoid fever or of cholera (and probably other\r\ndiseases), without themselves suffering in health, and that\r\nunsuspected they thus become distributing centres of these diseases.\r\nThe names \"typhoid carrier\" and \"cholera carrier\" have actually been\r\nintroduced to describe the condition of such persons. Then, again, by\r\nhis breath, and by coughing and spitting, a man acts as a carrier to\r\nothers of disease-microbes already lodged in him, as well as by actual\r\ncontact in the case of those infections which are called \"contagious.\"\r\nThe numerous animals which surround and are associated with man act\r\nvery largely as casual carriers and distributors of disease microbes.\r\nThus dogs and even the cleanly cat are frequently carriers of disease.\r\nBut more especially those creatures which visit man's food stores and\r\nfood ready for consumption (such as bread, fruits, cold meat, etc.)\r\nare active carriers. Rats and mice run over such stores and pollute\r\nthem. But the most widely active in this way is the common house-fly.\r\n\r\nWhilst white men have developed an almost automatic resistance and\r\nobjection to the visits of flies to their lips, eyelids, and any wound\r\nor scratch of the skin--a resistance which is not shown by many savage\r\nraces--they yet allow house-flies to swarm in their dwellings, to run\r\nabout and sample their food, with an indifference which is, when the\r\ntruth is known, truly horrible in its fatuity and foolhardiness. For\r\nthe fact is that the feet and proboscis of the common house-fly are\r\ncovered with microbes of all sorts, picked up by his explorations upon\r\nevery kind of filth. At every step which he takes he plants a few\r\ndozen microbes, which include those of infantile diarrhoea, typhoid,\r\nand other prevalent diseases. This is easily shown by allowing him to\r\nwalk over a smooth plate of sterilised nutritive gelatine and\r\npreserving it afterwards free from the access of microbes from the\r\nair. In twenty-four hours every footstep of the fly on the gelatine is\r\nmarked by an abundant and varied crop of microbes, which have\r\nmultiplied from the individuals let drop by the little pedestrian.\r\nThere is no doubt whatever that the house-fly is a main source of the\r\ndissemination of the microbe of infantile diarrhoea, and the cause\r\nannually of hundreds of thousands of deaths of children in the great\r\ncities of Europe and America. Also in camps and infected districts he\r\nis largely responsible for the introduction of the microbe of typhoid\r\nfever into the human food to which he has free access after his\r\nprevious visits to open latrines. The house-fly is himself a product\r\nof dirt and neglect. The eggs are laid in old manure heaps and kitchen\r\nmiddens, and the maggots, which eventually are transformed into flies,\r\nnourish themselves in those accumulations. When this refuse is rapidly\r\nand regularly removed by the care of the sanitary officials of a town,\r\nthe flies diminish in number, as they have diminished in London within\r\nthe last thirty years. We no longer are overrun by flies in London in\r\nthe summer months. The man selling sheets of sticky paper is no longer\r\nheard in our streets calling \"Catch 'em alive, oh!\" But in country\r\nplaces, where a neglected stable-yard is near the dining room of the\r\ninn, house-flies are as great a nuisance and danger as ever. There is\r\nno difficulty, if the simplest rules of cleanliness are observed, in\r\nabolishing them altogether from human association, but combined and\r\nsimultaneous action against them is an essential condition of success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nIMMUNITY AND CURATIVE INOCULATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the last twenty years the whole attitude of the study and\r\ninvestigation of disease-causing microbes has advanced from the\r\npreliminary step of merely identifying certain microbes as the causes\r\nof certain diseases to a further step, viz. that of attempting to\r\ndefend the animal and the human body against their attacks in the\r\nmanner already so finely started by Pasteur. For many years disease\r\nafter disease was examined and found to be caused by special bacteria\r\nor other microbes. Even non-infectious diseases or diseases only\r\ncommunicable under very special conditions were found to be due to\r\nmicrobes, so that it is probable that all disease that is not due to\r\ncongenital malformation or to mechanical injury, or to poison\r\nfabricated in the weapons of larger animals and plants, or by man\r\nhimself, is due to microbes. \"Life,\" says Lord Justice Moulton, \"is\r\none ceaseless war against these enemies, and the periods of our\r\ntoo-transient successes are known as health.\" One of the last diseases\r\ntraced to microbes is that sad condition known as \"infantile\r\nparalysis,\" by which so many of the brightest and best members of the\r\ncommunity have been crippled, from childhood onwards, through life.\r\n\r\nOf late we have been making rapid strides in arriving at a knowledge\r\nas to how Nature herself protects higher creatures from the excesses\r\nand exuberance of destructive microbes, and we are now able to see\r\nthat it is in adopting her methods that our best hope of increasing\r\nthat protection lies. Nature is satisfied if the efficacy of her\r\ndefence is sufficient to save enough individuals to carry on the race.\r\nMan desires in the case of his own fellows to out-do Nature and to\r\nsave all.\r\n\r\nA century and a half ago, before the true character of infective\r\ndisease was understood, it was observed that an individual who was\r\nattacked by the smallpox and recovered became incapable of receiving\r\nthe infection again. He was \"protected\" or \"immune.\" The practice of\r\n\"inoculation\" was introduced from the East by Lady Montague. The\r\ninfectious matter was introduced from a smallpox patient into the\r\nperson to be protected by rubbing it into a scarified part of the\r\nskin. A much less severe attack of smallpox was thus produced than\r\nthat which usually followed the natural infection, which (though we do\r\nnot know precisely its mode of entrance) is more widely spread through\r\nthe blood. At the same time the condition of \"immunity\" after the\r\nattack was brought about with equal efficacy. When Jenner introduced\r\ninoculation with \"cowpox\" for the purpose of establishing \"immunity\"\r\nin the vaccinated person, inoculation with smallpox itself was a very\r\nusual practice. It was open to the objection that sometimes an\r\nunexpectedly violent attack of the disease was produced, resulting in\r\ndeath, and that the active infection was kept alive and ever present\r\nin the community. The notion with regard to the mode in which\r\n\"immunity\" was produced by either the Montacutian or Jennerian\r\ninoculation was, even after the general knowledge of microbes as the\r\nliving contagion of disease had been arrived at, that the mild attack\r\ndue to inoculation \"used up\" something in the blood--in fact,\r\nexhausted the soil, so that the infective matter or microbe could no\r\nlonger flourish in the blood. And this view was accepted as the\r\nexplanation of the \"immunity\" to the anthrax disease conferred on\r\ncattle and sheep by Pasteur's inoculations of weakened, but still\r\nactively growing, cultures of the anthrax bacillus. Another theory was\r\nthat they produced something in the blood by their own life-processes\r\nwhich checked their further growth, just as yeast will not grow in\r\nwort in which it has produced 8 per cent. of alcohol, and as a fire\r\nmay be choked by its own smoke or ashes.\r\n\r\nWe now know that both these explanations of \"immunity\" are incorrect.\r\nNature provides at least three varieties of defence within the blood\r\nof higher animals against disease-producing microbes which have broken\r\nthrough the outer line of fortification, the skin. These three methods\r\nare effective in different cases (one in this disease, the other in\r\nthat), and, on the whole, are sufficient to preserve the races of\r\nanimals (including man) from complete destruction. These are (1) the\r\nproduction in the blood of an antidote to the toxin or poison\r\nelaborated by the invading microbe--an antitoxin, which chemically\r\nneutralises the toxin; (2) the production in the blood of the attacked\r\nanimal of a \"germicidal\" poison which repels and kills the attacking\r\nmicrobes themselves (not merely neutralising their poisonous\r\nproducts); (3) the extermination of the intrusive, disease-producing\r\nmicrobes by a kind of police, which scour the blood channels and\r\ntissues and \"eat up\"--actually engulf and digest--the hostile\r\nintruders. These latter agents, actual particles of the living animal\r\nin which they exist, are the \"eater-cells,\" or \"phagocytes\"--minute,\r\nviscid, actively moving cells, resembling the animalcules called\r\n\"amoeba.\" They are only the one two-thousandth of an inch in\r\ndiameter, and are known as the white or colourless corpuscles of the\r\nblood. They are far less numerous than the red blood-corpuscles, which\r\nare the agents for carrying oxygen, but there are eight thousand\r\nmillion of them in a large spoonful of blood. They are the really\r\nimportant agents in protecting us from microbes, since they not only\r\nengulf and digest and so destroy those intruders, but it is probable\r\n(not certain) that they also are the manufacturers of the antitoxins\r\nand of the germicidal poisons.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf these three defensive processes given us by Nature are in working\r\norder, that is to say, if we are \"healthy,\" they should secure to us a\r\nsufficient \"immunity\"--at at any rate, \"recovery\"--from any attack of\r\ndisease-producing microbes. But they are not in \"unselected,\" widely\r\nranging mankind always equal (in their unaided natural state) to their\r\ntask.\r\n\r\nThe attempts to produce immunity by vaccination with weakened or\r\nlocalised disease germs is really an attempt to train and develop to a\r\nhigh point the activities of the phagocytes or eater-cells of the\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of antitoxins by injection of them into the blood (as\r\nin the treatment of diphtheria, lock-jaw, and snake-bite) is an\r\nattempt to bring to the rescue of a patient who would sooner or later\r\nproduce his own antitoxins (but perhaps too late or in insufficient\r\nquantity) the similar antitoxin obtained from the blood of another\r\nanimal which has been artificially made to produce in its blood an\r\nexcessive quantity of that substance.\r\n\r\nMithridates, King of Pontus, was, according to ancient legend, in\r\nconsequence of his studies and experiments, soaked with all kinds of\r\npoisons to which he had become habituated by gradually increasing\r\ndoses, and he had at last reached a condition in which no poison could\r\nharm him, so that when he was captured by the Romans and wished to\r\nkill himself (which was the correct thing in those days for a fallen\r\nking to do), he wept because he was unable to get any poisons which\r\nwould act upon him. He was \"immune\" to all poisons. This real or\r\nsupposed immunity resulting from the introduction into the living body\r\nat intervals of a series of doses of a poison gradually increasing\r\nstrength has been called \"Mithridatism,\" and animals and men so\r\ntreated have been said to be \"mithradatized.\" The toleration of\r\npoisonous drugs--such as tobacco and alcohol, and even of mineral\r\npoisons, such as arsenic--was, until lately, regarded as merely a\r\nspecial exhibition of that habituation of \"adaptation by use\" which\r\nliving things often show in regard to some of the conditions of their\r\nlife. Unusual cold, unusual heat, unusual moisture, salinity or the\r\nreverse, unusual deprivation of food, unusual muscular effort may be\r\ntolerated by animals without injury provided that they have been\r\n\"gradually accustomed\" to the unusual thing, or, in other words, that\r\nthe unusual has been gradually made the usual; so that there is a\r\nsaying that eels after a time even get used to being skinned. There\r\nwas no attempt to explain the details of this process of habituation;\r\nit was assumed to be a part of the general \"educability\" of living\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nThe study of the education of living matter, in regard to various\r\nconditions which can act upon it, has yet to be further carried out,\r\nbut the way in which the poisons made by disease germs and the like,\r\nand the disease germs themselves, are dealt with in the blood and\r\ntissues has, on account of its urgent importance, from a medical point\r\nof view, been already profoundly studied by experimental and\r\nmicroscopic methods of late years. The old notion as to \"mithridatism\"\r\nwas that an animal or a man would have to be separately prepared and\r\n\"immunised\" by habituation for every distinct kind of poison. We now\r\nknow that this is not the usual way in which Nature confers immunity\r\nto poisons. Most astonishing, and at first sight magical or\r\nmysterious, powers exist in the living protoplasmic cells in and\r\naround the blood of man and higher animals, which enable their\r\npossessors to resist and combat the poison-producing microbes, and\r\nalso the poison itself, of all kinds, by which the race is liable to\r\nbe attacked.\r\n\r\nFew of us realise what a wonderful and exceptional fluid the blood of\r\na higher animal is. The Australian natives attach so little importance\r\nto it that they actually cut themselves and use their blood as a sort\r\nof paste for sticking decorative feathers on to a pole! The Papuans\r\nare more advanced, since they regard the flow of blood from a cut or\r\ngraze as an evil portent. And some respect to the greatness and wonder\r\nof blood is shown by those persons among civilised peoples (more\r\nfrequently men than women) who faint when they see blood, or even at\r\nthe mention of its name! This stream of red fluid within us (of which\r\nan average man has about fifteen pints in his vessels) courses at a\r\ntremendous rate from the heart through all the endless branches and\r\nnetworks of arteries, capillaries and veins, and back to the heart. It\r\nfeeds, cleanses, warms and takes \"vital air\" (the old name for oxygen\r\ngas) dissolved in it to every particle of our bodies, fresh and fresh\r\nat every pulse-beat as it rushes on. It not only absorbs crude\r\ndigested food through the walls of the gut, but conveys it to where it\r\nis worked up and distributes the worked-up product. It removes the\r\nquickly used-up substances from every part, and the choke-damp or\r\ncarbonic acid which would stop the whole machine, and kill us, were it\r\nnot got rid of through the lungs as the blood hurries through the\r\nwalls of these air-sacs, whilst other used-up materials are carried by\r\nit to the kidneys and passed out of the body through them. Every part\r\nof the body is brought into common life with every other part by this\r\nimpetuous blood-stream--which is here, there, and everywhere, right\r\nround, and back again, in twenty-five seconds! It is obviously a very\r\nserious thing if a poison-producing microbe gets into this\r\nblood-stream and multiplies within it, or if poison-producing microbes\r\nlodge somewhere beneath the skin in a wound, and keep on discharging\r\nvirulent poison into the blood! The mischief is spread all over the\r\nbody at once.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising, then, that the long course of natural selection\r\nand survival of the fittest has resulted in the fixing in the blood\r\nand the living cells immediately connected with it of extraordinary\r\nprotective powers. The floating scavenger cells (eater-cells or\r\nphagocytes, first recognised as such and so named by Metchnikoff) are\r\nalready found in the blood of quite simple animals in worms,\r\nshell-fish and insects. I have watched them with the microscope at\r\nwork in transparent minute living water-fleas eating up, and digesting\r\nmicrobes which had got into the water-flea's blood. In higher animals\r\nwhat we call \"inflammation\" is a condition--the result of a new and\r\nadvantageous mechanism--which consists in a local retarding of the\r\nblood-current, effected by the action of the nerves on the muscular\r\nwalls of the blood-vessels, and the consequent escape of the\r\neater-cells into the injured or infected tissue, there to eat up and\r\ndestroy the injurious microbes or other particles. Special and\r\nremarkable properties--chemical activities of an extraordinary\r\ncharacter--have been gradually developed in the floating phagocytes\r\nand in similar non-floating fixed cells over which the blood flows.\r\n\r\nThese special chemical activities are of several distinct kinds. The\r\nfirst is the power to convert the poison of a microbe into a destroyer\r\nof that poison--toxin into antitoxin. The atoms of these poisons are\r\nelaborately composed combinations of the organic elements. By a\r\n\"shake\" or a \"twist\" (so to speak) administered by the living cells of\r\nthe blood the combination is altered, and the toxin becomes an\r\nantitoxin, destroying by chemically combining with it the very toxin\r\nfrom which it was formed. This is a far more efficacious method than\r\nthe supposed mithridatic \"habituation\" or \"toleration\" of a poison,\r\nwith small doses of which you have to be gradually prepared. The\r\nhealthy blood converts any one of a large series of microbe poisons\r\ninto antitoxins. It is true that apparent \"opposites\" are often\r\nclosely allied in Nature. Evil smells and tastes are closely allied to\r\nsweet perfumes and flavours, and what is healthy and agreeable to some\r\nmen acts as virulent poison to others (_e.g._ shell-fish, egg,\r\nquinine, opium). The smallest change in the substance administered or\r\nthe smallest difference in the living substance of an individual (what\r\nis called \"idiosyncrasy\") makes all the difference between \"poison\"\r\nand \"meati.\"\r\n\r\nIf the phagocytes and similar cells in the blood of a man or animal\r\nexposed to the poison produced by localised microbes (such as those of\r\ntetanus, diphtheria and septic growths) cannot produce enough\r\nantitoxin so as to quickly destroy the poison, we can, and do,\r\nnowadays, save his life, by injecting into his blood the required\r\nantitoxin, obtained from another animal which we have caused (by\r\ninjection of the toxin) to produce the antitoxin in excess. That is\r\none sort of \"immunity\" or \"resistance\" which we can confer, and is\r\nlargely in use at the present day--the \"antitoxin\" treatment.\r\n\r\nThe second poison-repelling chemical activity of the blood, produced\r\nby the living cells in and about it, consists in the blood becoming\r\ndirectly poisonous to injurious microbes. It becomes \"bactericidal,\"\r\nproduces a bactericidal poison (called an alexin) which is usually\r\npresent in normal blood, but is greatly increased when large numbers\r\nof certain poisonous microbes (_e.g._ those of typhoid fever) get into\r\nthe blood. Again, by other chemical substances produced in it, the\r\nblood may, without actually killing the invading bacteria, only\r\nparalyse them, and cause them to \"agglutinate\" (that is, to adhere to\r\none another as an inactive \"clot\" or \"lump\"). As the \"agglutinating\"\r\npoison is peculiar (or nearly so) for each kind of microbe, we can\r\ntell whether a patient has typhoid by drawing a drop of his\r\nblood into a tube, and adding some fresh living typhoid bacilli\r\nto it. If the patient had typhoid he will have begun to form the\r\n\"typhoid-agglutinating\" or \"typhoid-paralysing\" poison in his blood,\r\nand the experiment will result in the \"agglutination\" (sticking\r\ntogether in a lump) of the typhoid bacilli. And so we prove, in a\r\ndoubtful case, that the patient has typhoid.\r\n\r\nThe third chemical activity of the blood in dealing with poisonous\r\nmicrobes is also one which is conferred upon it by its living cells\r\nwhen excited by the presence of those microbes. It is the production\r\nof a \"relish\" (for so it must be called) which attaches itself to the\r\nmicrobes and renders them attractive to the eater-cells (the\r\nphagocytes), so that those swarming amoeba-like floating particles\r\nat once proceed to engulf the microbes with avidity. In the absence of\r\nthe relish (the Greek word for it used by Sir Almroth Wright, its\r\ndiscoverer, is \"opsonin\"), the eater-cells are sluggish--too\r\nsluggish--in their work. They resemble a child who will not eat dry\r\ntoast, or, at best, only slowly, but will devour rapidly many pieces\r\nwhen the toast is buttered. It is of the utmost importance to us that\r\nour white corpuscles, or eater-cells, should not be sluggish but\r\ngreedy.\r\n\r\nThere are some microbes which will produce deadly poison if grown in\r\nthe clear fluid (serum) of the blood of an animal (as, for instance,\r\nthe cholera-microbe when grown in the serum of the frog's blood), yet\r\nwhen inoculated living into the blood of that animal never cause the\r\nslightest illness! Why? Because they are at once eaten by the vigilant\r\nphagocytes of the blood before they can produce any appreciable amount\r\nof poison. That is easily demonstrated by experiment. Our main means\r\nof defence against microbial disease, says Metchnikoff--though\r\ncleanliness and precaution against access of microbes are all very\r\nwell in their way--is the activity of our phagocytes. Now it appears\r\nthat just as in the other cases I have been considering, so in the\r\nproduction of \"relish,\" the power to produce it resides in the blood\r\n(and perhaps the cells of its vessels), but is not set at work until\r\nthe enemy is in the blood. Suppose there is an infection, an invasion\r\nof the blood and tissues by one or other disease-causing microbe.\r\nGradually if the body is healthy the \"relish\" is produced and becomes\r\nattached to the invading microbes. The phagocytes swallow them\r\ngreedily and make an end of the invasion.\r\n\r\nIt is proved that this aroused avidity of the phagocytes is due to no\r\nchange in the phagocytes themselves; since if they are transferred to\r\nthe serum of a normal man they show no such predilection for the\r\nspecial invading microbe. The \"opsonin,\" or \"relish,\" is something\r\nexuded into or produced in the blood fluid when the attacking microbe\r\narrives. It attaches itself to them: that is the essential fact. In\r\nmany of us the phagocytes are not at a given moment so \"avid\" of this\r\nor that disease-microbe as they should be in order to protect us from\r\nits multiplication and poison production. But it is found that by\r\ninjecting boiled and cooled (therefore dead) microbes of a particular\r\nkind into the blood of a man, you can start the production of the\r\n\"relish\" appropriate to that kind. The dead microbes answer this\r\npurpose; they excite the production of the opsonin appropriate to them\r\nand yet are not themselves dangerous, since they are dead. When\r\nsubsequently (or possibly concurrently in small quantity) living\r\nmicrobes of the same disease enter the blood, the opsonin is ready for\r\nthem. They are, to put it picturesquely, like oysters at the\r\noyster-bar, peppered and vinegared \"in no time,\" and then swallowed by\r\nthe phagocytes by the dozen. This seems almost too comic a view of the\r\ndeadly struggle of man and higher animals for health and freedom from\r\nthe swarming pests which everywhere invade him. Yet it is correct, and\r\ninvolves a simple and fundamental truth. Our properties and appetites\r\nare but the sum of those of the protoplasmic organisms--the cells--of\r\nwhich we are built up. Our need for a relish with oysters is the same\r\nthing as the need of the phagocyte for a relish with its microbes, not\r\nsomething \"poetically\" compared to it. The story of \"the oysters and\r\nthe carpenter\" might be replaced by that of \"the microbes and the\r\nphagocyte.\" The saying, \"Fine words butter no parsnips,\" finds a\r\nparallel in the remark that \"The drinking of drugs does not opsonise\r\nmicrobes.\"\r\n\r\nHalf-way between us and the amoeba-like unicellular organisms we\r\nfind the earth-worm preparing his piece of lettuce (as Darwin showed)\r\nwith a juice exuded from his mouth, a \"relish\" reminding one of the\r\nKava drink of the South Sea Islanders. To \"opsonise\" or render\r\nattractive by the application of chemical \"relish\" is a proceeding\r\nwhich we find in operation in the feeding of the minute colourless\r\ncorpuscles which engorge the still more minute bacteria--and also in\r\nthe preparation of their food by various lower animals, and finally in\r\nthe elaborate flavouring and cooking of his food by civilised man!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nTHE STRANGE STORY OF ANIMAL LIFE IN NEW ZEALAND\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Zealand consists of two islands, together more than 1,000 miles\r\nlong and of about 200,000 square miles area. It is 1,000 miles distant\r\nfrom New Caledonia, the nearest island of any considerable size, and\r\nis 1,500 miles from the great Continental island of Australia. There\r\nis no other island in the world so large and at the same time so\r\nremote from other considerable tracts of land. Australia is closely\r\nconnected by island groups at a distance of only 100 miles to Asia.\r\nThe isolation of New Zealand is unique. The seas around it are of vast\r\ndepth and of proportionately great age. During the chalk\r\nperiod--before the great deposits and changes of the earth's face\r\nwhich we assign to the Tertiary period--New Zealand consisted of a\r\nnumber of small scattered islands, which gradually, as the floor of\r\nthe sea rose in that part of the world, became a continent stretching\r\nnorthward and joining New Guinea. In that very ancient time the land\r\nwas covered with ferns and large trees. Birds (as we now know them)\r\nhad only lately come into existence in the northern hemisphere, and\r\nwhen New Zealand for a time joined that area the birds, as well as a\r\nfew lizards and one kind of frog, migrated south and colonised the new\r\nland. It is probable that the very peculiar lizard-like reptile of New\r\nZealand--the \"tuatara\" or Sphenodon--entered its area at a still\r\nearlier stage of surface change. That creature (only 20 in. long) is\r\nthe only living representative of very remarkable extinct reptiles\r\nwhich lived in the area which now is England, and, in fact, in all\r\nparts of the world, during the Triassic period, further behind the\r\nchalk in date than the chalk is behind our own day. For ages, this\r\n\"type\" with its peculiar beak-like jaws, has survived only in New\r\nZealand. Living specimens have been brought to this country, and are\r\nto be seen at the Zoological Gardens in Regent's Park. Having\r\nreceived, as it were, a small cargo of birds and reptiles, but no\r\nhairy, warm-blooded quadruped, no mammal, New Zealand became at the\r\nend of the chalk-period detached from the northern continent, and\r\nisolated, and has remained so ever since. Migratory birds from the\r\nnorth visited it, and at a late date two kinds of bat reached it and\r\nestablished themselves.\r\n\r\nThus we are prepared for the very curious state of things in this\r\nlarge tract of land. Looking at New Zealand as it was a thousand years\r\nago, we find there were no mammals living on it excepting a couple of\r\nbats and the seals (so-called sea lions, sea elephants, and others)\r\nwhich frequent its coasts. There were 180 species of birds, and many\r\nof these quite peculiar to the island. Many of the birds showed in the\r\nabsence of any predatory enemies--there being no carnivorous\r\nquadrupeds to hunt them or their young--a tendency to lose the power\r\nof flight, and some had done so altogether. The gigantic, wingless\r\nMoas--allied to the ostrich and the cassawary--had grown up there, and\r\nwere the masters of the situation. There were many species of\r\nthese--one of great height--one fourth taller than the biggest known\r\nostrich; others with short legs of monstrous thickness and strength.\r\nAllied to these are the four species of Kiwi or apteryx, still\r\nexisting there. They are very strange wingless birds, about the size\r\nof a large Dorking fowl. The Kiwis are still in existence, but the\r\nMoas and some of the other flightless birds have died out since the\r\narrival of the Maori man, who killed and ate them.\r\n\r\nA bird which was believed sixty years ago both by the natives and\r\nwhite men to have become extinct, the Takahe, or Notornis, was known\r\nby its bones and from the traditions of the natives. Much to the\r\ndelight of naturalists, four live specimens of it were obtained at\r\nintervals in the last century, the last as late as 1898. The beautiful\r\ndark plumage and thick and short beak, which is bright red, as are the\r\nlegs, are well known from the two specimens preserved in the Natural\r\nHistory Museum. The Notornis is a heavy, flightless \"rail.\" Rails are\r\nremarkable for their size and variety in New Zealand, where there are\r\ntwenty species, some of them very sluggish in flight, or like\r\nNotornis, flightless (the wood hens). Amongst the flightless birds of\r\nNew Zealand is a duck, as helpless as the heaviest farmyard product,\r\nand yet a wild bird, and then there are the penguins, which swim with\r\ntheir wings, but never fly, and belong entirely to the southern\r\nhemisphere. Many species are found on the shores of New Zealand. Other\r\nnoteworthy birds of New Zealand are the twelve kinds of cormorants,\r\nthe wry-bill plover, the only bird in the world with its beak turned\r\nto one side, the practically flightless Kakapo, or ground parrot\r\n(Stringops), the Huia, a bird like a crow in appearance, whose male\r\nhas a short straight beak, whilst the female has a long one, greatly\r\ncurved; the detested Kea, the parrot which kills the sheep, introduced\r\nby the colonists, by digging out with its beak from their backs the\r\nfat round the kidneys; also very peculiar owls and wrens, and the fine\r\nsinging bell-birds.\r\n\r\nThe peculiarity of the indigenous animals of New Zealand is seen not\r\nonly in the absence of mammals and the abundance of remarkable birds,\r\nmany of them flightless, but also in the fact that there are no snakes\r\nin this vast area--no crocodiles, no tortoises--only fourteen small\r\nkinds of lizard (seven Geckoes and seven Skinks), and only one species\r\nof frog (and that only ever seen by a very few persons)! There were\r\nfish in the rivers when settlers arrived there, but none very\r\nremarkable. Insects and flies of every kind, scorpions, spiders,\r\ncentipedes, land-snails and earth-worms were all flourishing in the\r\nforests of New Zealand a thousand years ago, serving in large measure\r\nas the food of birds, fish and lizards. The great island continent of\r\nAustralia, 1,500 miles away, is peculiar enough in its living\r\nproducts, quite unlike the rest of the world in its egg-laying\r\nduck-mole and spiny ant-eater, and in its abundant and varied\r\npopulation of pounched mammals or marsupials, emphasized by the\r\nabsence (except for two or three peculiar little mice and the\r\nlate-arrived black-fellow and bush-dog) of the regular type called\r\n\"placental\" mammals which inhabit the rest of the world. The rest of\r\nthe world except New Zealand! Strange as Australia is, New Zealand is\r\nyet stranger. Long as the isolation of Australia has endured, and\r\narchaic and primitive in essential characters as is its living freight\r\nof animals and plants navigated (as it were) in safety and isolation\r\nto our present days, yet New Zealand has a still more primitive, a\r\nmore ancient cargo. When we divide the land surfaces of the earth\r\naccording to their history as indicated by the nature of their living\r\nfauna and flora and their geological structure, and the fossilised\r\nremains of their past inhabitants, it becomes necessary to separate\r\nthe whole land surface into two primary sections: (_a_) New Zealand,\r\nand (_b_) the rest of the world, \"Theriogoea,\" or the land of beasts\r\n(mammals). Then we divide Theriogoea into (1) the land of Marsupials\r\n(Australia) and (2) the land of Placentals (the rest of the world).\r\nThis last great area is divisible according to the same principles\r\ninto the great northern belt of land, the Holarctic region and the\r\n(three not equally distinct) great southward-reaching land\r\nsurfaces--the Neo-tropical (South America), the Ethiopian (Africa,\r\nsouth of the Sahara), and the Oriental (India and Malay).\r\n\r\nThe bird-ruled quietude of New Zealand was disturbed 500 years ago by\r\nthe arrival of the Polynesian Islanders, the Maoris, in their canoes.\r\nThey brought with them three kinds of vegetables which they\r\ncultivated, a dog and a kind of rat. The dogs soon died out, but the\r\nrat has remained, and is considered to have done little or no harm. It\r\nwas not one of the destructive proliferous rats of the northern\r\nhemisphere. The Maoris hunted the big birds--the Moas and others--for\r\ntheir flesh, and ate their eggs, and it is probable that they caused\r\nor accelerated the extinction of the Moa and two or three other birds.\r\nIn the north island they nearly exterminated the white heron, the\r\nplumes being valued by them. On the whole, very little damage was done\r\nto the natural products of the islands by the Maoris. \"It was with the\r\nadvent of the Europeans,\" says Mr. John Drummond, F.L.S., in his\r\ninteresting and well-illustrated book on 'The Animals of New Zealand,'\r\n\"that destruction began in earnest. It seemed as if they had been\r\ncommanded to destroy the ancient inhabitants.\" They killed right and\r\nleft, and, in addition, burnt up the primæval forests and bushes till\r\na great part of the flora was consumed. It was never a very varied or\r\nstrong one, consisting only of some 1,400 species, which are now in\r\nlarge proportion vanishing, whilst 600 species of plants, most of them\r\nintroduced accidentally rather than intentionally by the European\r\nsettlers, have taken their place.\r\n\r\nHere I may state the great principle which, in regard to plants as\r\nwell as animals, determines the survival of intruders from one region\r\nto another. It appears that setting aside any very special and\r\npeculiar adaptations to quite exceptional conditions in a given area,\r\nthe living things, whether plants or animals, which are brought to or\r\nnaturally arrive at such an area, survive and supplant the indigenous\r\nplants and animals of that area, if they themselves are kinds\r\n(species) produced or formed in a larger or more variegated area; that\r\nis to say, formed under severer conditions of competition and of\r\nstruggle with a larger variety of competitors, enemies and adverse\r\ncircumstances in general. Thus, the plants of remote oceanic islands\r\nare destroyed, and their place and their food are taken by the more\r\nhardy \"capable\" plants of Continental origin. And, in accordance with\r\nthe same principle, as Darwin especially maintained, the plants of the\r\nnorthern hemisphere, produced as they are in a wide stretching belt\r\nof land--Europe, temperate Asia, and North America--always push their\r\nway down the great southern stretches of land (by cool mountain\r\nroadways), and when they have arrived in the temperate regions of the\r\nsouthern hemisphere, they have at various geological epochs starved\r\nout, taken the place of, or literally \"supplanted\" the native southern\r\nflora, which in every case has been formed on a narrow, restricted and\r\npeninsula-like area. The same greater \"potency\" of the animals of the\r\nHolartic region has in the past established them as intruders into\r\nSouth America, Ethiopia and India, and has led to the inevitable\r\nsurvival of the animal of the large area when brought into contact\r\nwith the animal of the small and restricted area. Applying these\r\nprinciples to New Zealand, we see that no country, no area of land,\r\ncould have a worse chance for the survival of its animal and vegetable\r\nchildren than that mysterious land, isolated for many millions of\r\nyears in the ocean, the home of the Tuatara, solitary survivor of an\r\nimmensely remote geologic age, the undisturbed kingdom of huge birds,\r\nso easy-going that they have ceased to fly, and have even lost their\r\nwings!\r\n\r\nThe first European animals to settle there were the pigs benevolently\r\nintroduced into New Zealand by Captain Cook. They multiplied apace,\r\nserved for food and sport both to the natives and the early settlers,\r\nand destroyed the ancient Triassic reptile, the Tuatara, which only\r\nsurvives now on rocky islands near the coast. In less than a hundred\r\nyears the settlers had introduced sheep and cattle, and looked upon\r\nthe abounding pigs as a scourge. In 1862, pig-hunters were employed to\r\ndestroy them--three hunters would kill 20,000 pigs in a year. Dogs,\r\ncats and the European rats came in early with the settlers, and\r\ndestroyed the flightless birds, driving them for shelter to the\r\nmountains. As the settlers increased they shot down millions of birds\r\nof all kinds, and burnt up grass, shrub, and bush. At last, a few\r\nyears ago, the Government established three islands as \"sanctuaries,\"\r\nwhere many of the more interesting birds survive, and are increasing.\r\n\r\nBesides cattle and sheep (which have flourished exceedingly) the\r\ncolonists introduced rabbits, pheasants and the honey-bee, and later\r\non quails, hares, deer, and trout. Clover depends on bees for its\r\nfertilisation and seeding. White clover, taken over there for pasture,\r\ndid not seed in New Zealand until the honey-bee was imported in 1842,\r\nand later, as they could not seed red-clover without it, the colonists\r\nhad to introduce the humble-bee, and the red-clover now also seeds\r\nfreely and the imported farm-beasts have their accustomed food.\r\nBesides the animals already named, the colonists have introduced\r\nferrets and weasels, to reduce the destructive excess of the imported\r\nrabbits; and they, whilst failing to subdue the rabbits, have\r\nthemselves become a serious nuisance. Of small birds there were\r\nintroduced the house-sparrow, which is too prolific, and is hated by\r\nthe farmers; the greenfinch, a pest; the bullfinch, a failure. The\r\nintroduced skylark and the blackbird (alas! poor colonists) are not\r\nthe joy of New Zealanders--the farmers hate them. The European\r\nsettlers had the audacity to introduce also the most beautiful and\r\nbeloved of all birds, our own perfect \"Robin Redbreast,\" and they add\r\nwant of manners to their violent and uncalled-for hospitality by\r\nspeaking ill of this sweetest and brightest of living things. After\r\nthis, I am rather glad to report that the esteemed table-delicacies,\r\npheasants and partridges, don't get on well in New Zealand; nor do\r\nturtle-doves. The thrush is spreading and meets with the approval of\r\nthe hypercritical New Zealander. The hedge-sparrow, the chaffinch and\r\nthe goldfinch have flourished abundantly, but the linnet has failed. A\r\nvery interesting and important problem for New Zealand naturalists to\r\nsolve is that as to why one bird succeeds in their remote land and\r\nanother does not. The British trout have grown to an enormous size and\r\nare destroying all other fresh-water life. Imported red-deer flourish,\r\nand are shot with great satisfaction by the colonists. The American\r\nelk has been introduced in the South Island, and the mountain\r\ngoats--the ibex and the thar--are to be acclimatized in the mountains,\r\nso that unnatural sport may flourish in this ancient land of quiet and\r\nof wondrous birds, turned topsy-turvy by enlightened man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nTHE EFFACEMENT OF NATURE BY MAN\r\n\r\n\r\nVery few people have any idea of the extent to which man since his\r\nupgrowth in the late Tertiary period of the geologists--perhaps a\r\nmillion years ago--has actively modified the face of Nature, the vast\r\nherds of animals he has destroyed, the forests he has burnt up, the\r\ndeserts he has produced, and the rivers he has polluted. It is, no\r\ndoubt, true that changes proceeded, and are proceeding, in the form of\r\nthe earth's face and in its climate without man having anything to say\r\nin the matter. Changes in climate and in the connections of islands\r\nand continents across great seas and oceans have gone on, and are\r\ngoing on, and in consequence endless kinds of animals and plants have\r\nbeen, some extinguished, some forced to migrate to new areas, many\r\nslowly modified in shape, size, and character, and abundantly\r\nproduced. But over and above these slow irresistible changes there has\r\nbeen a vast destruction and defacement of the living world by the\r\nuncalculating reckless procedure of both savage and civilised man\r\nwhich is little short of appalling, and is all the more ghastly in\r\nthat the results have been very rapidly brought about, that no\r\ncompensatory production of new life, except that of man himself and\r\nhis distorted \"breeds\" of domesticated animals, has accompanied the\r\ndestruction of formerly flourishing creatures, and that, so far as we\r\ncan see, if man continues to act in the reckless way which has\r\ncharacterised his behaviour hitherto, he will multiply to such an\r\nenormous extent that only a few kinds of animals and plants which\r\nserve him for food and fuel will be left on the face of the globe. It\r\nis not improbable that even these will eventually disappear, and man\r\nwill be indeed monarch of all he surveys. He will have converted the\r\ngracious earth, once teeming with innumerable, incomparably beautiful\r\nvarieties of life, into a desert--or, at best, a vast agricultural\r\ndomain abandoned to the production of food-stuffs for the hungry\r\nmillions which, like maggots consuming a carcase, or the irrepressible\r\nswarms of the locust, incessantly devour and multiply.\r\n\r\nAnother glacial period or an overwhelming catastrophe of cosmic origin\r\nmay fortunately, at some distant epoch, check the blind process of\r\ndestruction of natural things and the insane pullulation of humanity.\r\nBut there are, it seems probable, many centuries of what would seem to\r\nthe men of to-day deplorable ugliness and cramping pressure in store\r\nfor posterity unless an unforeseen awakening of the human race to the\r\ninevitable results of its present recklessness should occur. Whatever\r\nmay be the ultimate fate of the earth under man's operations, we\r\nshould endeavour at this moment to delay, as far as possible, the\r\nhateful consummation looming ahead of us.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note a few instances of man's destructive action.\r\nEven in prehistoric times it is probable that man, by hunting the\r\nmammoth--the great hairy elephant--assisted in its extinction, if he\r\ndid not actually bring it about. At a remote prehistoric period the\r\nhorses of various kinds which abounded in North and South America\r\nrapidly and suddenly became extinct. It has been suggested, with some\r\nshow of probability, that a previously unknown epidemic disease due to\r\na parasitic organism--such as those which we now see ravaging the\r\nherds of South Africa--found its way to the American continent. And it\r\nis quite possible that this was brought from the other hemisphere by\r\nthe first men who crossed the Pacific and populated North America.\r\n\r\nTo come to matters of certainty and not of speculation, we know that\r\nman by clearing the land, as well as by actively hunting and killing\r\nit, made an end of the great wild ox of Europe, the aurochs or urus of\r\nCæsar, the last of which was killed near Warsaw in 1627. He similarly\r\ndestroyed the bison, first in Europe and then (in our own days) in\r\nNorth America. A few hundred, carefully guarded, are all that remain\r\nin the two continents. He has very nearly made an end of the elk in\r\nEurope, and will soon do so completely in America. The wolf and the\r\nbeaver were destroyed in these British Islands about 400 years ago.\r\nThey are rapidly disappearing from France, and will soon be\r\nexterminated in Scandinavia and Russia and in Canada. At a remote\r\nprehistoric period the bear was exterminated by man in Britain and the\r\nlion driven from the whole of Europe, except Macedonia, where it still\r\nflourished in the days of the ancient Greeks. It was common in Asia\r\nMinor a few centuries ago. The giraffe and the elephant have departed\r\nfrom South Africa before the encroachments of civilised man. The day\r\nis not distant when they will cease to exist in the wild state in any\r\npart of Africa, and with them are vanishing many splendid antelopes.\r\nEven our \"nearest and dearest\" relatives in the animal world, the\r\ngorilla, the chimpanzee and the ourang, are doomed. Now that man has\r\nlearnt to defy malaria and other fevers the tropical forest will be\r\noccupied by the greedy civilised horde of humanity, and there will be\r\nno room for the most interesting and wonderful of all animals, the\r\nman-like apes, unless (as we may hope in their case, at any rate) such\r\nliving monuments of human history are made sacred and treated with\r\ngreater care than are our ancient monuments in stone. Smaller\r\ncreatures, birds like the dodo and the great auk and a whole troop of\r\nothers less familiar, have disappeared and are disappearing under the\r\nhuman blight. Even some beautiful insects--the great copper butterfly\r\nand the swallow-tail butterfly--have been exterminated in England by\r\nhuman \"progress\" in the shape of the drainage of the Fen country.\r\n\r\nBut the most repulsive of the destructive results of human expansion\r\nis the poisoning of rivers, and the consequent extinction in them of\r\nfish and of well-nigh every living thing, save mould and putrefactive\r\nbacteria. In the Thames it will soon be a hundred years since man, by\r\nhis filthy proceedings, banished the glorious salmon, and murdered the\r\ninnocents of the eel-fare. Even at its foulest time, however, the\r\nThames mud was blood-red (really \"blood-red,\" since the colour was due\r\nto the same blood-crystals which colour our own blood) with the swarms\r\nof a delicate little worm like the earth-worm, which has an\r\nexceptional power of living in foul water, and nourishing itself upon\r\nputrid mud. In old days I have stood on Hungerford Suspension Bridge\r\nand seen the mud-banks as a great red band of colour, stretching for a\r\nmile along the picture when the tide was low. In smaller streams,\r\nespecially in the mining and manufacturing districts of England,\r\nprogressive money-making man has converted the most beautiful things\r\nof nature--trout streams--into absolutely dead corrosive chemical\r\nsewers. The sight of one of these death-stricken black filth-gutters\r\nmakes one shudder as the picture rises, in one's mind, of a world in\r\nwhich all the rivers and the waters of the sea-shore will be thus\r\ndedicated to acrid sterility, and the meadows and hill-sides will be\r\ndrenched with nauseating chemical manures. Such a state of things is\r\npossibly in store for future generations of men! It is not \"science\"\r\nthat will be to blame for these horrors, but should they come about\r\nthey will be due to the reckless greed and the mere insect-like\r\nincrease of humanity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the destruction of trees and all kinds of plants man has\r\ndeliberately done more mischief than in the extermination of animals.\r\nBy inadvertence he has completely abolished the strange and remarkable\r\ntrees and shrubs of islands--such as St. Helena--where the herbivorous\r\nanimals introduced by him have made short work of the wonderful native\r\nplants isolated for ages, and have completely exterminated them, so\r\nthat they are \"extinct.\" We have just had the opportunity of studying\r\none of the few oceanic islands--\"Christmas Island\" (forty square miles\r\nin area)--untouched by man until thirty years ago. It lies 200 miles\r\nsouth of Java. Its native inhabitants, plants and animals were\r\ncarefully examined, and specimens secured twenty years ago. There were\r\nthen no human inhabitants, and the island was rarely visited. It was,\r\nhowever, about twelve years ago handed over by its proprietors to some\r\nthousand Chinamen to dig and ship the 15,000,000 tons of valuable\r\n\"phosphate\" (at a profit of a guinea a ton), which forms a large part\r\nof its surface. And now from time to time we shall have reports of\r\nthis result of contact with man, and through him with all the plagues\r\nand curses of the great world. Already a remarkable shrew-mouse and\r\ntwo native species of rat, peculiar to the island, have disappeared.\r\nDr. Andrews (\"Proceedings of the Zoological Society,\" February 2nd,\r\n1909), who has twice explored the island, gives evidence that this is\r\ncaused by a parasitic disease (due to a trypanosome like those which\r\ncause sleeping-sickness and various horse and cattle diseases)\r\nintroduced by the common black rats from the ships which now frequent\r\nthe island. The further progress of destruction will be carefully and\r\nminutely observed and recorded--but not arrested!\r\n\r\nIt is, however, in cutting down and burning forests of large trees\r\nthat man has done the most harm to himself and the other living\r\noccupants of many regions of the earth's surface. We can trace these\r\nevil results from more recent examples back into the remote past. The\r\nwater supply of the town of Plymouth was assured by Drake, who brought\r\nwater in a channel from Dartmoor. But the cutting down of the trees\r\nhas now rendered the great wet sponge of the Dartmoor region, from\r\nwhich the water was drawn all the year, no longer a sponge. It no\r\nlonger \"holds\" the water of the rainfall, but in consequence of the\r\nremoval of the forest and the digging of ditches the water quickly\r\nruns off the moor, and subsequently the whole countryside suffers from\r\ndrought. This sort of thing has occurred wherever man has been\r\nsufficiently civilised and enterprising to commit the folly of\r\ndestroying forests. Forests have an immense effect on climate, causing\r\nhumidity of both the air and the soil, and give rise to moderate and\r\npersistent instead of torrential streams. Spain has been irretrievably\r\ninjured by the cutting down of her forests in the course of a few\r\nhundred years. The same thing is going on, to a disastrous extent, in\r\nparts of the United States. Whole provinces of the Thibetan borders of\r\nChina have been converted into uninhabitable, sandy desert, where\r\ncenturies ago were fertile and well-watered pastures supporting rich\r\ncities, in consequence of the reckless destruction of forest. In fact,\r\nwhether it is due to man's improvident action or to natural climatic\r\nchange, it appears that the formation of \"desert\" is due in the first\r\nplace to the destruction of forest, the consequent formation of a\r\nbarren, sandy area, and the subsequent spreading of what we may call\r\nthe \"disease\" or \"desert ulcer,\" by the blowing of the fatally exposed\r\nsand and the gradual extension, owing to the action of the sand\r\nitself, of the area of destroyed vegetation. Sand-deserts are not, as\r\nused to be supposed, sea-bottoms from which the water has retreated,\r\nbut areas of destruction of vegetation--often (though not always) both\r\nin Central Asia and in North Africa (Egypt, etc.), started by the\r\ndeliberate destruction of forest by man, who has either by artificial\r\ndrainage starved the forest, or by the simple use of the axe and fire\r\ncleared it away.\r\n\r\nThe great art of irrigation was studied and used with splendid success\r\nby the ancient nations of the near East. They converted deserts into\r\ngardens, and their work was an act of compensation and restitution to\r\nbe set off against the destructive operations of more barbarous men.\r\nBut they, too, long ago were themselves destroyed by conquering hordes\r\nof more ignorant but more war-like men, and their irrigation works and\r\nthe whole art of irrigation perished with them. One of the absolutely\r\nnecessary works to be carried out by civilised man, when he has ceased\r\nto build engines of war and destruction, is the irrigation of the\r\ngreat waterless territories of the globe. A little home-work of the\r\nkind has been carried on in Italy regularly year by year since the\r\ndays of Leonardo da Vinci, and our Indian Government is slowly\r\ncopying the Italian example. In Egypt we have built the great dam of\r\nAssouan, whilst in Mesopotamia it is proposed to re-establish the\r\nirrigation system by which it once was made rich and fertile. But, as\r\nhas lately been maintained by Mr. Rose Smith in his book, \"The Growth\r\nof Nations,\" the vast possibilities of irrigation have not yet been\r\nrealised by the business men of the modern world. Millions of acres in\r\nthe warmer regions of the earth now unproductive can be made to yield\r\nfood to mankind and rich pecuniary profits to the capitalists who\r\nshall introduce modern engineering methods and a scientific system of\r\nirrigation into those areas.\r\n\r\nThe whole problem of the increase of the more civilised races and the\r\nnecessary accompanying increase of food-production depends for its\r\nsolution on the speedy introduction of irrigation methods into what\r\nare now the great unproductive deserts of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nTHE EXTINCTION OF THE BISON AND OF WHALES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe almost complete and very sudden disappearance of the bison in\r\nNorth America thirty years ago does not seem to have been due simply\r\nto the slaughter of tens of thousands of these creatures by men who\r\nmade a commerce of so-called \"buffalo-rugs.\" These \"hunters\" miscalled\r\nthe unhappy bison, which is not a buffalo, nor at all like that\r\ncreature, just as they gave the name \"elk\" to the great red deer (the\r\nwapiti), although there was a real elk, the so-called \"moose,\" staring\r\nthem in the face. The sudden extinction of the bison resulted partly\r\nfrom the slaughter and partly from the breaking up of the herds and\r\nthe interference with their free migration by the trans-continental\r\nrailway. An interesting discovery made only this year, in regard to\r\nthe closely allied European bison, suggests that disease may also have\r\nplayed a part in the destruction of the North American bison. A few\r\nhundred individuals of the European bison are all that remain at this\r\nday. Some are carefully preserved by the Emperor of Russia in a tract\r\nof suitable country in Lithuania and another herd exists in the\r\nCaucasus. Some of the Lithuanian bison have lately been dying in an\r\nunaccountable way, and on investigating a dead individual a Russian\r\nobserver has discovered a \"trypanosome\" parasite in the blood. The\r\ntrypanosomes are microscopic corkscrew-like creatures, of which many\r\nkinds have become known within the last ten or fifteen years. They are\r\n\"single cells\"--that is to say, \"protoplasmic\" animalcules of the\r\nsimplest structure--provided with a vibrating crest and tail by means\r\nof which they swim with incessant screw-like movement through the\r\nblood. They rarely exceed one thousandth of an inch in length\r\nexclusive of the tail. The poisons which they produce by their life in\r\nthe blood are the cause of the sleeping-sickness of man (in tropical\r\nAfrica), of the horse and cattle disease carried by the tsetze fly,\r\nand of many similar deadly diseases--a separate \"species\" being\r\ndiscovered in each disease. A peculiar species is found in the blood\r\nof the common frog, and another in that of the sewer-rat. The last\r\ndiscovery of a \"trypanosome\" is that of one in the blood of the\r\nAfrican elephant, announced to the Royal Society by Sir David Bruce.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of great interest that a trypanosome has been found in\r\na death-stricken herd of European bison. It suggests that one of the\r\ncauses of the disappearance of the bison, both in Europe and America,\r\nmay be the infection of their blood by trypanosomes, and that\r\npossibly, whilst a freely migrating and vigorous herd would not be\r\nextensively infected, a dwindled and confined herd may be more liable\r\nto infection, and that thus the final destruction of an already\r\ndecadent animal may be brought about. It would now be a matter of\r\nextreme interest to ascertain whether the few dwindled herds of bison\r\nin North America are infected by trypanosomes, and no doubt we shall\r\nsoon receive reports on the subject.\r\n\r\nA most interesting branch of this subject of the unthinking\r\nextermination of great animals by man is that of the extermination of\r\nwhales. Man is worrying them out of existence. Some are already beyond\r\nsaving. It would be interesting to know whether there are trypanosomes\r\nor other blood-parasites in whales. I suppose that no one has an\r\nill-feeling towards whales. Most of us have never seen a whale, either\r\nalive or in the flesh--only a skeleton. I have seen a live whale or\r\ntwo off the coast of Norway; and I once, in conjunction with my friend\r\nMoseley, when we were students at Oxford, cut up one, 18 ft. long,\r\nwhich had been exhibited for three weeks during the summer in a tent\r\non the shores of the Bristol Channel, where we purchased it. The\r\nskeleton of that whale is now in the museum at Oxford, but happily the\r\nsmell of it exists only in my memory. The late Mr. Gould, who produced\r\nsuch beautifully illustrated books on birds, told me that he once fell\r\ninto the heart of a full-sized whale, which he was cutting up. He\r\nnarrowly escaped drowning in the blood. The whale was not very fresh,\r\nand Mr. Gould was unapproachable for a week.\r\n\r\nAn immense number of whales are killed every year for their oil, and\r\ntheir highly nutritious flesh is wasted. There was an attempt some\r\nyears ago to make meat extract from it. Some which was brought to me\r\nreminded me of the whale on the shores of the Bristol Channel. I do\r\nnot know if the extract has proved palatable to other people. The\r\nNorwegians are specially expert in killing whales. They have been\r\nallowed to set up \"factories\" on the west coast of Ireland and in the\r\nShetlands, where they kill whales with harpoons fired from guns, cut\r\nthem up, and boil down the fat.\r\n\r\nWhales are warm-blooded creatures which suckle their young, and have\r\nbeen developed in past geological times from land animals--the\r\nprimitive carnivora--which were also the ancestors of dogs, bears,\r\nseals and cats. Whales have lost the hind limbs altogether and\r\ndeveloped the forelegs into fingerless flippers, whilst the tail is\r\nprovided with \"flukes\" like the fins of a fish's tail in shape, but\r\nhorizontal instead of vertical. The whole form is fish-like, the skin\r\nsmooth and hairless. It is a remarkable conclusion arrived at by the\r\ninvestigators of the remains of extinct animals that a little\r\nfour-legged creature the size of a spaniel, and intermediate in\r\ncharacter between a hedgehog and a dog, was the common ancestor from\r\nwhich have been derived such widely different creatures as the whale\r\nand the bat, the elephant and the man. We can at the present day trace\r\nwith some certainty the gradual modifications of form by which in the\r\ncourse of many millions of years the change from the primitive,\r\ndog-like hedgehog to each of those four living \"types\" has proceeded.\r\n\r\nThe whales of to-day are divided into the toothed whales and the\r\nwhalebone whales. The great cachalot or sperm whale is captured,\r\nchiefly in the Southern Ocean, and killed in large numbers for the\r\nsake of the \"spermaceti,\" or \"sperm oil,\" which forms the great mass\r\nof its head, but he is so fierce and active that he is not easily\r\ncaptured, and is not in immediate danger of extinction. The smaller\r\ntoothed whales, the killers, dolphins, and porpoises (though one of\r\nthem--the bottle-nosed whale--is being killed out), are not as yet\r\nseriously threatened by commercial man. But the whalebone whales are\r\nin a parlous state. The Right whales, as they are called, are the\r\nchief of these. They are huge creatures, 60 ft. in length, with an\r\nenormous head: it is as much as one third of the total length in the\r\nGreenland whale. Besides the Greenland species there are four other\r\n\"right whales,\" which may be considered as four varieties of one\r\nspecies. The head is not quite so large in them. The Biscay whale is\r\none of them, and was hunted until it was exterminated in the Bay of\r\nBiscay, when the whalers, extending their operations further and\r\nfurther north, came upon the Greenland whale, which proved to be even\r\nmore valuable than the Biscay species. The huge mouth in these two\r\nwhales has hanging from its sides within the lips a series of long\r\nbars or planks of wonderfully strong, elastic, horny substance--the\r\n\"baleen\" or \"whalebone\"--each plank being as much as eight or in rare\r\ncases twelve feet long. Following close on one another and having\r\nhairy edges, they act as strainers so as to separate the floating food\r\nof the whale from the water which rushes through its mouth as it\r\nswims. The whalebone is of great value commercially, as is also the\r\nfat or oil. A hundred years ago whalebone fetched only £25 a ton, now\r\nthe same quantity fetches more than £1,500. The Rorquals, or\r\n\"Finners,\" have smaller heads and mouths; their whalebone is so short\r\nas to be valueless, but they grow to even greater size than the Right\r\nwhales and are found on our own coasts and all over the world. The\r\nHumpback whale is one of these \"Finners,\" distinguished by its\r\nexcessively long flippers and huge bulk.\r\n\r\nThe Biscay whale was the first of these great creatures to be hunted.\r\nThe Basques began its capture as early as the ninth century. It was\r\nexterminated by them in the Bay of Biscay, and only saved from\r\ncomplete extinction elsewhere by the discovery of the more valuable\r\nArctic or Greenland whale. The capture of the Greenland whale began in\r\n1612; and in 200 years the unceasing pursuit of this species had\r\ndriven it to the remote places of the Arctic Ocean. It is now so rare\r\nthat it is not worth while to send a ship out for the purpose of\r\nhunting it, and it will probably never recover its numbers. An idea of\r\nits value and former abundance may be formed from the fact that\r\nbetween 1669 and 1778 it yielded to 1,400 Dutch vessels about 57,000\r\nindividuals, of which the baleen and oil produced a money value of\r\nfour million pounds sterling. Of late years a single large Greenland\r\nwhale would bring £900 for its whalebone and £300 for its oil. These\r\ntwo great Right whales having been practically exterminated, the\r\nmerciless hunt has now been turned on to the wilder and less valuable\r\nFinback whales or Finners. In these days of steam and electric light\r\nthe Arctic night is robbed of its terrors, and the whale chase goes on\r\nvery fast. The shot harpoon was invented in 1870 by Sven Foyn, a\r\nNorwegian, and is the most deadly and extraordinary weapon ever\r\ndevised by man for the pursuit of helpless animals. It is this\r\ninvention (a commercial, not a scientific, discovery!) which has, in\r\nconjunction with swift steamships, rendered the destruction of whales\r\na matter of ease and deadly certainty. It is this which is being used\r\non the Irish as on the Scandinavian coast, resulting in the pollution\r\nof the air and water by the carcases of the slaughtered beasts from\r\nwhich the oil has been extracted. This revolting butchery, without\r\nforesight or intelligence, is carried on solely for the satisfaction\r\nof human greed, and apparently will be stopped only by the extinction\r\nof the yet remaining whales. In forty years in the middle of last\r\ncentury the whale fishery of the United States yielded 300,000 whales\r\nto 20,000 voyages, and a value of sixty-million pounds sterling in\r\nbaleen and oil. It is calculated that in the thousand years during\r\nwhich man has hunted the great whales not less than a million\r\nindividuals have been captured. Man's skill and capacity have now\r\nbecome such that he will soon have cleared the ocean of these\r\nwonderful creatures, since, like the bison, the whales cannot persist\r\nwhen harried and interfered with beyond a certain limited degree.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the curious musk ox, which now lives on the fringe of\r\nthe Arctic circle, and in the glacial period existed in the Thames\r\nValley, is doomed. There (as in similar instances in other lands), the\r\ncomparatively harmless savage race of men (in this case the Eskimo),\r\nwhose weapons did not enable them seriously to threaten the existence\r\nof the animals around them, have now obtained efficient firearms. The\r\nmusk ox is consequently now between two lines of fire--that of the\r\nwhite hunter on the south, and of the Eskimo on the north.\r\n\r\nFrom regions far remote from the Arctic complaints come of an even\r\nmore reckless destruction of helpless animals. Perhaps our legislators\r\nmay feel some personal concern in this case, since it is neither more\r\nnor less than the approaching extinction of the turtle, the true green\r\nturtle of City fame, to eat which at the invitation of City\r\ndignitaries is one of the few duties of a legislator. Both the green\r\nturtles and the tortoise-shell turtles are being destroyed\r\nindiscriminately on the coast of Florida and in many West Indian\r\nIslands by brutal, careless, \"white\" beach-combers and idlers. By\r\nproper care of the eggs and young the turtles could easily be\r\nincreased enormously in number, and a regulated capture of them be\r\nmade to yield a legitimate profit. But neither the United States\r\nGovernment nor our own take any steps to restrain promiscuous\r\nslaughter of the turtles which come to the shore in order to lay their\r\neggs. Soon the City Fathers will have to do without the \"green fat\"\r\nand their wives without tortoise-shell combs. It will serve them\r\nright. Such destitution in these--and, be it noted, in many other\r\nmatters--will deservedly fall upon those who ignorantly, wilfully, and\r\ncontentedly neglect to take steps to understand and to control the\r\nwithering blight created by modern man wherever he sets his foot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nMORE ABOUT WHALES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe possibility of protecting whales from wanton slaughter by man is,\r\nno doubt, a matter open to discussion. Protection has, however, been\r\naccorded to one particular whale in an exceptional instance. Passenger\r\nsteamers along the coast of New Zealand used to call at a station in a\r\nnarrow inlet of the coast, called Pelorus Sound. A black whale, said\r\nto be of the kind known as Risso's Grampus, of about 14 ft. in length,\r\nwas apparently a settled inhabitant of this channel, and used to\r\nfollow the steamers and accompany them through the sound. He became\r\nfamous and popular, and was known as \"Pelorus Jack.\" He was always\r\nlooked for and recognised by the sailors and passengers. Certain\r\nsavagely destructive persons on one of these steamers--to the horror\r\nand disgust of the New Zealand world--made an attempt to shoot\r\n\"Pelorus Jack.\" It is stated, and believed by sailors, that ill-luck\r\nconsequently fell on that steamer. On its next voyage it was avoided\r\nby the whale, who had never failed to welcome friendly and\r\nnon-aggressive steamships, and on a third voyage the steamer was\r\nwrecked. The feeling about \"Pelorus Jack\" was so strong that his\r\nExcellency the Governor of New Zealand, Lord Plunket, signed, on\r\nSeptember 26th, 1904, an Order in Council, protecting \"Pelorus Jack\"\r\nby name for five years, and any person interfering with him was made\r\nliable to a fine of £100.\r\n\r\nIt appears that under the New Zealand Sea Fisheries Act of 1894 the\r\nGovernor in Council is empowered to make regulations protecting any\r\nfish. Although zoologically not belonging to the class of fishes,\r\nwhales are, technically and for all legal and commercial purposes\r\n\"fishes,\" since they are \"fished\" and are the booty of \"fisheries.\" I\r\nbelieve that no Governor, Council, or Secretary of State has power in\r\nthe British Islands similar to that conferred on the Governor of New\r\nZealand by a modern State which desires good and effective government.\r\nSuch power is needed in all parts of the British Empire.\r\n\r\nThe whales, as compared with their dog-like ancestors, are modified to\r\na more extreme degree and in more special ways than is the case in any\r\nother group of which we can trace the history over a similar period of\r\ndevelopment. This is connected with the complete change of conditions\r\nof life to which these mammals (\"warm-blooded, air-breathing\r\nquadrupeds which suckle their young\") have become adapted in passing\r\nfrom a terrestrial to a marine existence. Other mammalian ancestors\r\nhave independently taken to a marine life and given rise to\r\nstrange-looking adaptations, namely, the seals and also the Manatee\r\nand Dugong known as the Sirenians (so-called because they give rise to\r\nsailors' stories of mermaids and sirens), but these are far less\r\nchanged, less modified than the whales. The whales have acquired a\r\ncompletely fish-like form. They frequently have a large back fin, and\r\nhave lost the hind legs altogether. The horizontally spread flukes of\r\nthe whale's tail have nothing to do with the hind legs, whereas the\r\ncommon seal's hind legs are tied together so as to form a sort of\r\ntail. In the bigger whales, sunk deep in the muscle and blubber, we\r\nfind on each side well forward in the body (not near the tail) a pair\r\nof isolated, unattached bony pieces, which are the hip-bone and\r\nthigh-bone--all that remains of the hind limbs. The neck is so short\r\nthat in many whales the seven neck-bones, or \"vertebræ,\" are all fused\r\ninto one solid piece not longer than a single ordinary vertebra, and\r\nshowing six grooves marking off the seven vertebræ which have united\r\ninto one.\r\n\r\nThe head is more strangely altered than any other part of the whale.\r\nThe jaws are greatly elongated--so as to give a beak-like form in\r\nall--but this region is specially long and narrow in the \"beaked\r\nwhales\" known to zoologists by the name Ziphius, in which it consists\r\nof a solid piece of ivory-like bone, which we find in a fossil state\r\nin the bone-bed of the Suffolk Crag. Farther back the bones of the\r\nface are suddenly widened in all whales and porpoises, and in many\r\nthese bones grow up into enormous crests and ridges. The nostrils,\r\ninstead of being placed, as in other animals, at the free end of the\r\nsnout or beak, lie far back, so as to form the \"blow-hole,\" which is\r\nnear the middle of the head.\r\n\r\nThe circulation of the blood and the breathing of whales (including in\r\nthat term the smaller kinds known as dolphins and porpoises) is still\r\na matter which is not properly understood. When a Greenland whale is\r\nstruck by the harpoon it dives vertically downward to a depth of 400\r\nfathoms and more (nearly half a mile), and occasionally wounds the\r\nskin and bones of its snout by violently striking it on the\r\nsea-bottom. It remains below as long as forty minutes. Physiologists\r\nwish to know how the sudden compression of the air in the lungs in\r\nplunging to this depth and the equally sudden expansion of it in\r\nrising from such a depth is dealt with in the whale's economy, so as\r\nto prevent the absolutely deadly results which would ensue were any\r\nordinary air-breathing animal subjected to such changes of pressure.\r\nMan can endure without suffering an increase of pressure of the gases\r\nin his body amounting to three or four times that to which he is\r\naccustomed, as, for instance, when working in the compressed air of\r\n\"caissons.\" But the whale goes suddenly to a depth at which the\r\npressure is eighty times that at the surface! Then, too, man (and\r\nother terrestrial animals), after being subjected (for instance, in a\r\ncaisson) to a pressure of four times that which exists on the free\r\nsurface of the earth, is liable to be killed by suddenly passing from\r\nthat high pressure into the ordinary air. The gases dissolved in his\r\nblood expand like the gas in a bottle of soda-water when the cork is\r\ndrawn, and the bubbles interfere with the circulation of the blood in\r\nthe finer blood-vessels (of especial importance being those of the\r\nbrain and spinal cord), and the serious illness and the death of\r\nworkmen has frequently resulted from this cause. Accordingly, the men\r\nwho work in such \"compressed atmospheres\" are now made to pass slowly\r\nthrough a series of three chambers, in each of which the pressure is\r\ndiminished and brought nearer to that of the normal atmosphere. By\r\nspending twenty minutes in each chamber successively, the workman is\r\ngradually brought to the pressure of the outer world, and his blood\r\nprevented from \"effervescing.\" But what must be the condition of the\r\ngases in the blood of a whale which suddenly rises from 400 fathoms to\r\nthe surface? The whale suddenly goes, not from a pressure of four\r\ntimes the normal (\"four atmospheres,\" as it is called), but from\r\neighty times the normal, to the normal pressure.\r\n\r\nWhales, and also seals, are provided with remarkable special networks\r\nof blood-vessels in various parts of the body (called \"retia\r\nmirabilia\" by the old anatomists,) and also with a thick layer of fat\r\nunder the skin, the \"blubber\" (some feet deep in a large whale), full\r\nof blood-vessels. It has been suggested that these networks of\r\nblood-vessels are related in some way both to the power of keeping\r\nlong (forty minutes!) under water without breathing, and also to the\r\nfreedom of these marine monsters from the deadly effects of rapid\r\npassage from great to little gas-pressure. But it is only a\r\nsuggestion; no one has shown how the networks can act so as to effect\r\nthese results, and I am quite unable to say how they do so. Another\r\nsuggestion worth considering is that the whale completely empties the\r\ngas out of its lungs by muscular compression of the body-wall before\r\ndiving, so that there is no gas left in the body to be acted on by the\r\nincreased pressure resulting from its sinking into deep water. I am\r\nunable to deal with this puzzle myself, and I have not been able to\r\nfind any naturalist or physiologist who can throw light on the matter.\r\n\r\nThe toothed whales are nearer to the ancestral primitive whales than\r\nare the whalebone whales. The latter are the more peculiar, and\r\nspecially adapted with their huge heads and mouths (a third the length\r\nof the whole animal in the Greenland whale), and their palisades of\r\n350 whalebone planks, some 12 ft. long, on each side of the mouth. I\r\nmay mention in parenthesis that, whilst whalebone has been largely\r\nsuperseded by light steel in the making of umbrellas and corsets, its\r\nvalue remains, or rather increases, on account of its being the only\r\nmaterial for making certain kinds of large brushes which are used in\r\ncleaning machinery. The whalebone whales have, when first born, very\r\nminute teeth hidden in their jaws; they disappear. Some of the toothed\r\nwhales have teeth only in the lower jaw (the cachalot), others (the\r\nbeaked whales, Ziphius, etc.) have only one pair or two pairs of\r\nteeth. These are tusk-like, and placed in the lower jaw. Others (the\r\ndolphins and porpoises) have very numerous peg-like teeth in each jaw.\r\nSome of them feed on fish, pursuing the shoals of fish in parties or\r\n\"schools.\"\r\n\r\nA truly terrible toothed whale is the large porpoise called the killer\r\n(known to zoologists as _Orca gladiator_). He is the wolf of the sea,\r\nfar more active and formidable than any shark, about 10 ft. long, and\r\nstrangely marked in black, white, and yellow. He has jaws bigger than\r\nthose of the largest Mugger crocodile, and a tremendous array of\r\nfang-like teeth. These killers hunt the Right (or whalebone) whales in\r\nall parts of the world, in parties of three to twelve. They hang on to\r\nthe lips of their enormous \"quarry,\" and once they get a hold, in\r\ntwenty minutes tear it into pieces. Often they satisfy themselves with\r\ntearing out and devouring the gigantic tongue of their victim, leaving\r\nthe carcase untouched.\r\n\r\nThe narwhal and the white whale, or Beluga, which furnishes\r\n\"porpoise-hide\" for boots and laces, are both caught in northern seas,\r\nand form a closely allied pair, similar to one another in shape and\r\ncolour (the one white, the other grey), and of moderate size, about 12\r\nft. long. They both feed on cuttle-fish and minute shrimps, but the\r\nBeluga has many teeth and the narwhal (with the exception of some\r\nrudimentary ones) only a single pair, and these in the front of the\r\nupper jaw. In the female narwhal their pair of teeth remain\r\npermanently concealed in the jaw bone, and so does the right side one\r\nof the male. But the left side tooth of the male grows to an enormous\r\nsize, projecting horizontally in front of the narwhal to a length of\r\nseven or eight feet. It is a powerful weapon, and is formed of ivory\r\nspirally grooved on the surface. The narwhal was called \"the unicorn\r\nfish\" or \"Monoceras\" in ancient times, and its spirally marked tooth\r\nwas confused with the horn of the terrestrial unicorn--the rhinoceros.\r\nVery rarely the right tooth of the male narwhal grows to full size\r\nside by side with the left tooth. A specimen showing this\r\ndouble-toothed condition is in the Natural History Museum. A most\r\ncurious fact, quite unexplained as yet, is that the spiral grooving on\r\nboth the teeth turns in the same direction; in both it is like a\r\nspiral staircase in mounting which (starting from the base implanted\r\nin the jaw) you continually turn to the right. Now, in all other\r\nanimal structures which have a spiral growth and are paired--one\r\nbelonging to the right side of the animal, the other to the left, as,\r\nfor instance, the spirally marked horns of antelopes and the more\r\nloosely coiled horns of sheep and cattle--one of the pair forms a\r\nright-handed and the other a left-handed spiral. They are\r\n\"complementary\"; one is the reflection, as in a mirror, of the other.\r\nWhy the narwhal's tooth does not conform to this rule is a mystery.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable fact that only a few whales and porpoises eat fish\r\nor the flesh of other whales. The large toothed-whales, including the\r\ncachalot or sperm whale, and also the Ziphius-like beaked whales, live\r\nupon cuttle-fish. And it seems that they know where to hunt for this\r\nspecial article of diet and how to find it in quantity (probably at\r\ngreat depths in the ocean), which naturalists do not. Many new kinds\r\nof cuttle-fish have been discovered by examining the contents of the\r\nstomach of captured whales. The sperm whale feeds on monster squid\r\nand poulp such as we rarely, if ever, see alive or washed up on the\r\nshore. The hide of these cuttle-fish-eating whales and porpoises is\r\nscratched and scarred by the hooks attached to the suckers on the arms\r\nof the great cuttle-fish, and a test of the genuine character of\r\nambergris which forms as a concretion in the intestine of the\r\nsperm-whale is that it contains fragments of the horny beaks and hooks\r\nof the cuttle-fish digested by the whale. The food of the whalebone\r\nwhales consists of minute crustacea and of the little floating\r\nmolluscs known as _Clio borealis_, as big as the last joint of one's\r\nlittle finger, which float by millions in the Arctic Ocean. The\r\nwhalebone whales, after letting their huge mouths fill with the\r\nsea-water in which these creatures are floating, squeeze it out\r\nthrough the strainer formed by the whalebone palisade on each side--by\r\nraising the tongue and floor of the mouth. The water passes out\r\nthrough the strainer, and the nourishing morsels remain.\r\n\r\nSome fossil jaws and skulls of whales from miocene and older tertiary\r\nstrata are known which tend to connect the toothed whales with those\r\nmammals not modified for marine life. But the approach in that\r\ndirection does not go very far. The extinct whales called Squalodon\r\nhave tusk-like front teeth and molars which have the outline of a leaf\r\nwith a coarsely \"serrated\" edge. The bones of the face are also, in\r\nthem, more like those of an ordinary mammal than is the case with\r\nmodern toothed whales. The snout is not so long, and the bones which\r\nform it are a little more like those of a fox's snout than are those\r\nof the dolphin's \"beak.\" But on the whole it is astonishing how little\r\nwe know of fossil whales. We have yet to discover ancestral forms\r\npossessing small hind legs, but whale-like in other features. Some day\r\na lucky \"fossil-hunter\" will come upon the remains of a series of\r\nwhale-ancestors probably of Eocene age, and we shall know the steps by\r\nwhich a quadruped was changed into a cetacean--just as we have\r\nrecently learned the history of the development of elephants. We know\r\neven less about the ancestry of bats and the steps by which they\r\nacquired their wings than we do about the history of whales. These\r\ndiscoveries await future generations of men when \"cuttings\" and \"pits\"\r\nand quarries shall have been made in the rest of the earth's surface\r\nto the same extent as they have been in Europe and in parts of the\r\nAmerican continent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nMISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT SCIENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nI submit, as the final chapter of this little volume of miscellaneous\r\ndiversions, a few words intended to meet what has become a recurrent\r\nmisrepresentation and absurdity for which the annual congress of the\r\nBritish Association for the Advancement of Science furnishes the\r\nopportunity. Glib writers in various journals regularly seize this\r\noccasion to pour forth their lamentations concerning the incapacity of\r\n\"science\" and the disappointment which they experience in finding that\r\nit does not do what it never professed to do. They deplore that those\r\nengaged in the making of that new knowledge of nature which we call\r\n\"science\" do not discover things which they never set out to discover\r\nor thought it possible to discover, although the glib gentlemen who\r\nwrite, with a false assumption of knowledge, pretend that these things\r\nare what the investigations of scientific inquirers are intended to\r\nascertain. We read, at that season of the year, articles upon \"What\r\nScientists do not know\" and \"The Bankruptcy of Science,\" in which it\r\nis pretended that the purpose of science is to solve the mystery, or,\r\nas it has been called, the \"riddle,\" of the universe, and it is\r\npointed out, with something like malicious satisfaction, that, to\r\njudge by the proceedings of the congress of scientific investigators\r\njust concluded, we are no nearer a solution of that mystery than men\r\nwere in the days of Aristotle: and it is added that false hopes have\r\nbeen raised, and that matters which were once considered settled have\r\nagain passed into the melting-pot!\r\n\r\nThis kind of lamentation is not only (if I may use an expressive term)\r\n\"twaddle,\" but is injurious misrepresentation, dangerous to the\r\npublic welfare. The actual attitude of the investigators and makers of\r\nnew knowledge of nature is stated in a few words which I wrote ten\r\nyears ago: \"The whole order of nature, including living and lifeless\r\nmatter--from man to gas--is a network of mechanism, the main features\r\nand many details of which have been made more or less obvious to the\r\nwondering intelligence of mankind by the labour and ingenuity of\r\nscientific investigators. But no sane man has ever pretended, since\r\nscience became a definite body of doctrine, that we know or ever can\r\nhope to know or conceive of the possibility of knowing, whence this\r\nmechanism has come, why it is there, whither it is going, and what\r\nthere may or may not be beyond and beside it which our senses are\r\nincapable of appreciating. These things are not 'explained' by science\r\nand never can be.\"\r\n\r\nSo much for those who reproach science with the non-fulfilment of\r\ntheir own unwarranted and perfectly gratuitous expectations.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, having created in their readers' minds an unreasonable\r\nsense of failure and a mistrust of science, such writers go on to make\r\nuse of the want of confidence thus produced, in order to throw doubt\r\nupon the real conquests of science--the new knowledge actually made\r\nand established by the investigators of the last century--it becomes\r\nnecessary to say a little more. The public is told by these false\r\nwitnesses that science has \"dogmas,\" and that men of science are less\r\nsatisfied than they were with the \"dogmas\" of the last century.\r\nScience has no dogmas; all its conclusions are open to revision by\r\nexperiment and demonstration, and are continually so revised. But\r\nscience takes no heed of empty assertion unaccompanied by evidence\r\nwhich can be weighed and measured. \"_Nullius in verba_\" is the motto\r\nof one of the most famous Societies for the promotion of the knowledge\r\nof nature--the Royal Society of London.\r\n\r\nIt is especially in the area of biology--the knowledge of living\r\nthings--that the enemies of science make their most audacious\r\nattempts to discredit well-ascertained facts and conclusions. They\r\ntell their readers that those greater problems of the science (as they\r\nerroneously term them), such as the nature of variation among\r\nindividuals, the laws of heredity, the nature of growth and\r\nreproduction, the peculiarities of sex, the characteristics of habits,\r\ninstinct, and intelligence, and the meaning of life itself, have\r\nadvanced very little beyond the standpoint of the first and greatest\r\nbiologist, Aristotle. This statement is vague and indefinite; the\r\nconclusion which it suggests is absolutely untrue. Aristotle knew next\r\nto nothing about the mechanism of the processes in living things above\r\ncited. At the present day we know an enormous amount about it in\r\ndetail. But when men of science are told that they do not know the\r\n\"nature\" of this and the \"meaning\" of that, they frankly admit that\r\nthey do not know the real \"nature\" (for the expression is capable of\r\nendless variety of significance) of anything nor the real \"meaning\"\r\nnot only of life, but of the existence of the universe, and they say,\r\nmoreover, that they have no intention or expectation of knowing the\r\nultimate \"nature\" or the ultimate \"meaning\" (in a philosophical sense)\r\nof any such things. These are not problems of science--and it is\r\nmisleading and injurious to pretend that they are.\r\n\r\nI recently read an essay in which the writer is good enough to say\r\nthat, owing to the work of Darwin, the fact that the differences which\r\nwe see between organisms have been reached by a gradual evolution, is\r\nnot now disputed. That, at any rate, seems to be a solid achievement.\r\nBut he went on to declare that when we inquire by what method this\r\nevolution was brought about biologists can return no answer. That\r\nappears to me to be a most extraordinary perversion of the truth. The\r\nreason why the gradual evolution of the various kinds of organisms is\r\nnot now disputed is that Darwin showed the method by which that\r\nevolution can and must be brought about. So far from \"returning no\r\nanswer,\" Darwin and succeeding generations of biologists do return a\r\nvery full answer to the question, \"By what method has organic\r\nevolution been brought about?\" Our misleading writer proceeds as\r\nfollows: \"The Darwinian theory of natural selection acting on minute\r\ndifferences is generally considered nowadays to be inadequate, but no\r\nalternative theory has taken its place.\" This is an entirely erroneous\r\nstatement. Though Darwin held that natural selection acted most widely\r\nand largely on minute differences, he did not suppose that its\r\noperation was confined to them, and he considered and gave importance\r\nto a number of other characteristics of organisms which have an\r\nimportant part in the process of organic evolution. The assertion that\r\nthe theory of natural selection as left by Darwin \"is now generally\r\nheld to be inadequate\" is fallacious. Darwin's conclusions on this\r\nmatter are generally held to be essentially true. It is obvious that\r\nhis argument is capable of further elaboration and development by\r\nadditional knowledge, and always was regarded as being so by its\r\nauthor and by every other competent person. But that is a very\r\ndifferent thing from holding Darwin's theory of natural selection to\r\nbe \"inadequate.\" It is adequate, because it furnishes the foundation\r\non which we build, and it is so solid, complete and far-reaching that\r\nwhat has been added since Darwin's death is very small by comparison\r\nwith his original structure.\r\n\r\nLastly, we are told by the anonymous writer already quoted that at the\r\npresent time discussion is chiefly concentrated on the question as to\r\nwhether life is dependent only on the physical and chemical properties\r\nof the living substance, protoplasm, or whether there is at work an\r\nindependent vital principle which sharply separates living from\r\nnon-living matter! And the obvious and common-place conclusion is\r\nannounced that \"the ultimate problems of biology are as inscrutable as\r\nof old.\" All ultimate problems are, I admit, inscrutable. It is, on\r\nthe other hand, the business, and has been the glory and triumph, of\r\nscience, to examine and solve problems which are scrutable! It is\r\ncertainly not the case that, at the present time, discussion is\r\nconcentrated on the question of the existence of a vital principle.\r\nThere is absolutely no discussion in progress on the subject. No one\r\neven knows or attempts to state what is meant by \"a vital principle.\"\r\nIt is a phrase which belongs to \"the dead past,\" when men of science\r\nhad not discovered that you get no nearer to understanding a difficult\r\nsubject by inventing a name to cover your ignorance. Thirty-five years\r\nago the word \"vitality\" was used as some few philosophising writers\r\nare now using the term \"vital principle.\" Huxley at that time attacked\r\nthe views of Dr. Lionel Beale, who called in the aid of a mystical\r\n\"principle,\" which he named \"vitality,\" in order to \"account for\" some\r\nof the remarkable properties of protoplasm. As Huxley pointed out,\r\nthis supposed principle \"accounted for\" nothing, since it was merely a\r\nname for the phenomena for which it was supposed to account. Huxley\r\npointed out that many chemical compounds have remarkable\r\nproperties--as assuredly have the chemical compounds which are present\r\nin protoplasm--but men of science have not found it to help them in\r\ninvestigating the mechanism of those properties to ascribe them to\r\nmystical intangible \"principles\" differing from the agencies at work\r\nin other less exceptional substances.\r\n\r\nThus, for instance, water, though a very common and abundant chemical\r\ncompound formed by the union of two chemical elements, hydrogen and\r\noxygen, which, at the temperature and pressure of the earth's surface,\r\nare gaseous, offers many strange properties to our consideration not\r\nshared by other compounds of gaseous elements. For instance, hydrogen,\r\nwhen it combines with gaseous elements other than oxygen, does not\r\nform a compound which is liquid at the temperature and pressure of the\r\nearth's surface. Its combinations with nitrogen, with chlorine, with\r\nfluorine, and even some with the solid element carbon, are under those\r\nconditions gaseous. What a special character, therefore, has water!\r\nMoreover, water, though a liquid, yet behaves in a most peculiar way\r\nwhen either cooled below ordinary temperatures or heated above them.\r\nIt becomes solid when cooled, but expands at the same time, so that it\r\nis less dense when solid than when liquid--a most unusual proceeding!\r\nAnd when heated it is converted into vapour, but with a loss or\r\n\"making latent\" of heat, which, like its behaviour when solidifying,\r\nindicates that water is endowed with a very peculiar structure or\r\nmechanism in the putting together of its molecules. We might call\r\nthese combined peculiarities of water \"aquosity,\" and as we certainly\r\ncannot say why water should possess the lot of them, whilst other\r\ncompounds of either hydrogen or of oxygen, or, in fact, of any other\r\nelements, do not possess this combination, we might say that their\r\npresence is due to \"the aqueous principle,\" or \"aquosity,\" which\r\nenters into water when it is formed, but does not exist in other\r\nnatural bodies, and, indeed, \"sharply separates aqueous from\r\nnon-aqueous matter.\"\r\n\r\nHappily, though such a view would have been considered high philosophy\r\n200 years ago, no one is deluded at the present day into the belief\r\nthat by calling the remarkable properties of water \"aquosity\" you have\r\nadded anything to our knowledge of them. Yet those who invoke \"a vital\r\nprinciple\" or \"vitality\" in connection with protoplasm should, if they\r\nwere consistent, apply their method to the mystery of water. Let us\r\nsee how it would run. Though we may (the \"vitalists\" or \"aquosists\"\r\nwould say) experiment with water, determine exactly the temperature\r\nand pressure at which these remarkable phenomena are exhibited, though\r\nwe may determine its surface tension and its crystalline form, and\r\neven though we may weigh exactly the proportion of hydrogen to oxygen\r\nin its composition, yet when we look at a drop of water, there it is,\r\na wonder of wonders, endowed with \"aquosity,\" the ultimate nature of\r\nwhich is as inscrutable now as it was to Aristotle! It is perfectly\r\ntrue (we concede to the \"aquosists\") that the properties of water are\r\nnot accounted for by science; that is to say that, though we can\r\nimagine the molecular and atomic mechanism necessary for their\r\nexhibition, we cannot offer any suggestion as to how it is that that\r\nparticular mechanism is present in the chemical compound which the\r\nchemist denotes as H_{2}O, and is not present in other compounds,\r\nstill less can we say \"why\" these remarkable properties are\r\npresent--that is to say, for what purpose, although we know that if\r\nthey were not present the whole history and economy of our globe would\r\nbe utterly different from what it is. Nevertheless, in spite of their\r\nignorance about the real nature of water, men of science do not invent\r\nan \"aqueous principle\" or \"aquosity\" with the notion of \"explaining\"\r\nwater. And I have yet to hear of any duly trained and qualified\r\nbiologist who is prepared at the present moment to maintain the\r\nexistence of a \"vital principle,\" or of a force to be called\r\n\"vitality,\" supposed to be something different in character and\r\nquality from the recognised physical forces, and having its existence\r\nalongside, yet apart from, the manifestations of those forces.\r\n\r\nLord Justice Fletcher Moulton recently said: \"The advance in science\r\ntakes the workers in science more and more beyond the ken of the\r\nordinary public, and their work grows to be a little understood and\r\nmuch misunderstood; and I have felt that, as in many other cases, the\r\nneed would come for interpreters between those who are carrying on\r\nscientific research and the public, in order to explain and justify\r\ntheir work.\" Probably everyone will agree with the Lord Justice: but\r\nwhat are we to say of those responsible owners of great journals who\r\nnot only abstain from providing such interpretation but allow\r\nanonymous and incompetent writers to mislead the public? Is the\r\nliterary critic of a prosperous journal employed to write the City\r\narticle?\r\n\r\nThere has been a repetition this year (1912) of the usual\r\nmisrepresentation on the occasion of the meeting of the British\r\nAssociation. The President, Professor Schäfer, had let it be known\r\nthat his address would be concerned with the chemistry of living\r\nprocesses, the gradual passage of chemical combinations into the\r\ncondition which we call \"living,\" and the possibility of bringing\r\nabout this passage in the chemical laboratory without the use of\r\nmaterials already elaborated by previously existing \"living\" material.\r\nThe announcement was immediately made in some \"newspapers\" that\r\n\"startling revelations\" were to be made by the President, that he was\r\n\"to throw a bomb-shell\" into the camp, etc. He did nothing of the\r\nkind. He gave an admirable and clear statement of the progress during\r\nrecent years towards the realisation of the construction in the\r\nlaboratory by chemical methods of the complex chemical combination\r\nwhich exhibits those \"activities\"--essentially movements, unions,\r\ndisruptions and re-unions of extremely minute particles--which we call\r\n\"living.\" The conclusion that such a gradual building up has taken\r\nplace in past ages of the history of our earth was formulated more\r\nthan forty years ago by Spencer, Tyndall, Huxley, Haeckel, and others,\r\nand has not been seriously attacked in the interval, but, on the\r\ncontrary, generally accepted as a legitimate inference from the facts\r\nascertained and the theory of the evolution or gradual development of\r\nwhat we call the material universe.\r\n\r\nProfessor Schäfer expressed the opinion, anticipated and shared by\r\nmany other investigators, that the progress of chemical experiment\r\nrenders it probable that further steps, culminating in the successful\r\nconstruction of \"living\" matter in the laboratory, are not beset by\r\nany insurmountable obstacles and will sooner or later be accomplished.\r\nThere was no \"bomb-shell\" in this statement, and no excitement as its\r\nresult among scientific workers nor amongst those who do not neglect\r\nto study the writings of the \"interpreters\" desired by Lord Justice\r\nMoulton. There are still some such interpreters carrying on the work\r\nof Huxley and of Tyndall, those great interpreters whose writings\r\nshould be studied and treasured as classics.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting result of the attempt to treat the discussions\r\nat Dundee as a newspaper \"sensation,\" comparable to the reports\r\nrelating to motor-car bandits or the pronouncements of political\r\nfactions, has been its complete failure. Serious thinkers of all\r\nschools seem to have adjusted themselves to the more modern way of\r\nregarding natural processes even when these relate to matters of such\r\nage-long interest to mankind as the inception of \"living\" organisms\r\nand of conscious humanity itself. There are fewer now than there were\r\nforty years ago who insist on the older barbaric \"explanations\" of\r\nthese marvels. Few indeed venture to assert the existence of\r\n\"spirits\"--ghostly essences of various grades and capacities which\r\nenter the bodies of living things and escape from them like so much\r\ngas when they die.[10] The vegetable soul, the animal soul and the\r\nhuman soul are no longer imagined and described to us as definite\r\n\"things\" supposed to \"explain\" the complex processes which go on\r\nrespectively in plants, animals and men.\r\n\r\nSeventy years ago the facts which were known as to that changing state\r\nof material substances which we describe by the words \"hot\" and\r\n\"cold,\" were held to be \"explained\" by the existence of a ghostly\r\nthing called \"caloric,\" which was believed to enter various bodies and\r\nmake them hot and then to escape from them and so make them cold.\r\nPrimitive man multiplied such ways of explaining each and every\r\nprocess going on in the world around him and in himself. Mere words or\r\nnames lost their first simple signification and acquired permanent\r\nassociation with imaginary spirits, demons, and haunting intangible\r\nghosts, by reference to which our ancestors in their earliest\r\n\"reasoning\" explained to their own satisfaction the strange and sudden\r\nevents fraught to them with the daily experience of pain or pleasure.\r\nThe whole world was held by them to be \"bewitched,\" and it was only by\r\nslow and painful steps that some knowledge of the persistent order of\r\nNature was obtained, whilst the phantastic imagery which had served in\r\nits place, bit by bit disappeared. \"Caloric\" was a late lingerer, and\r\nwas only got rid of when what had been so called was shown to be a\r\nvibration of particles--a mode or kind of motion--a \"state,\" and not a\r\nmysterious fluid existing as a thing in itself.\r\n\r\nJust as \"caloric\" no longer serves and is no longer possible as the\r\nsupposed \"explanation\" of the behaviour of bodies in the hot or the\r\ncold state, so we no longer require the supposition of \"spirits\" of\r\none kind or another as \"explanations\" of the living state of those\r\nproducts of our mother earth which are called plants, animals and men.\r\nIn neither case do such \"spirits\" really \"explain\" the state in\r\nquestion; they are only names for the activity which it was imagined\r\nthat they served to explain. These states or affections of matter\r\nremain as wonderful and important to us as they were before. But by\r\ngiving up the prehistoric notions about them which have been handed on\r\nuntil the present day we can think of them in a more satisfactory\r\nway--a way which avoids the multiplication of unnecessary imaginary\r\nagencies and the conception of an intermittent and hesitating Creative\r\nPower, and substitutes for it the operation of continuous orderly and\r\npreordained forces.\r\n\r\nIt is true that we can neither ascertain nor imagine either the\r\nbeginning or the end of the orderly process which we discover in\r\noperation to-day. We can trace it back by well-established inference\r\ninto a remote past, but a beginning of it is not within the\r\npossibilities of human thought. We can, with reasonable probability of\r\nbeing correct, foretell the changes and developments which time will\r\nbring in many combinations and dispositions which are the\r\nmanifestations of that process at this moment of time, but we cannot\r\neven think of a cessation of that process.\r\n\r\nShould we ask, \"Why does this process exist?\" there is no answer.\r\nNature does not reply; an awful silence meets our inquiry. The\r\nreproach is often urged against science--the knowledge of the order of\r\nnature--that it does not tell us \"why we are here.\" Man inevitably\r\ndesires to know why he is here; but \"science,\" as that word is now\r\nunderstood, does not profess or even seek to answer that question,\r\nalthough the false hope has been raised in ignorant minds, sometimes\r\nby knavery, sometimes by honest delusion, that it could do so. By\r\nknowledge of nature mankind can escape much suffering and gain the\r\nhighest happiness, but that is all that we can hope for from it. We\r\nshall never satisfy our curiosity; we shall never know in the same way\r\nas we know the order of nature, why--to what end, for what\r\npurpose--that order and not another order exists.\r\n\r\nIt is very generally supposed that it is the business and profession\r\nof science \"to explain\" things--that is to say, to show how this or\r\nthat must and does come about in consequence of the operation of the\r\ngreat general properties of matter, known as the \"laws\" of chemistry\r\nand physics. This is true enough, but it is equally the work of\r\nscience to assert that of many things for which mankind demands \"an\r\nexplanation,\" there is no explanation. It is further the work and the\r\nservice of science to destroy and to remove from men's minds the\r\nbaseless and pretended \"explanations\" which are no explanations but\r\ncauses of error, blindness, and suffering.\r\n\r\nScience, the destroyer of \"explanations,\" is the purifier of the human\r\nmind, its cleanser from the crippling infection of prehistoric error\r\nand from domination by the terrifying nightmares of our half-animal\r\nancestry.\r\n\r\nFinally, in reference to the very ancient attempt to \"explain\" life\r\nand consciousness by the assertion that they are due to \"spirits\"\r\nwhich enter the bodies of animals and men, I must caution the reader\r\nagainst supposing that--for those who do not accept the belief that\r\nsuch spirits exist--the gravity and mystery of the manifestations of\r\nlife and consciousness are in any way lessened. Those who reject the\r\nbelief in \"spirits\" do not in consequence reject the ethical and moral\r\ndoctrines which have too long been rendered \"suspect\" by the shadow\r\ncast over them by ancient superstition. The disappearance of that\r\nshadow will reveal friends where enemies were supposed to be\r\nentrenched.\r\n\r\nAt the meeting of the British Association in 1879 I delivered an\r\naddress on \"Degeneration: a Chapter in Darwinism.\" In the printed\r\nversion of that address, published in the same year, there are some\r\nstatements bearing on the matter above discussed which I reproduce\r\nhere, since I can still make them with conviction.\r\n\r\n\"Assuredly it cannot lower our conception of man's dignity if we have\r\nto regard him as 'the flower of all the ages' bursting from the great\r\nstream of life which has flowed on through countless epochs with one\r\nincreasing purpose, rather than as an isolated miraculous being, put\r\ntogether abnormally from elemental clay, and cut off by such\r\nportentous origin from his fellow animals and from that gracious\r\nnature to whom he yearns with filial instinct, knowing her, in spite\r\nof fables, to be his dear mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"A certain number of thoughtful persons admit the development of man's\r\nbody by natural processes from ape-like ancestry, but believe in the\r\nnon-natural intervention of a Creator at a certain definite stage in\r\nthat development, in order to introduce into the animal which was at\r\nthat moment a man-like ape, something called 'a conscious soul' in\r\nvirtue of which he became an ape-like man.\"\r\n\r\n\"No one ventures to deny, at the present day, that every human being\r\ngrows from the egg _in utero_, just as a dog or a monkey does; the\r\nfacts are before us and can be scrutinised in detail. We may ask of\r\nthose who refuse to admit the gradual and natural development of man's\r\nconsciousness in the ancestral series, passing from ape-like forms\r\ninto indubitable man, 'How do you propose to divide the series\r\npresented by every individual man in his growth from the egg? At what\r\nparticular phase in the embryonic series is the soul with its\r\nconsciousness implanted? Is it in the egg? in the foetus of this\r\nmonth or that? in the new-born infant? or at five years of age?' This,\r\nit is notorious, is a point upon which churches have never been able\r\nto agree; and it is equally notorious that the unbroken series\r\nexists--that the egg becomes the foetus, the foetus the child, and\r\nthe child the man. On the other hand we have the historical\r\nseries--the series, the existence of which is inferred by Darwin and\r\nhis adherents. This is a series leading from simple egg-like organisms\r\nto ape-like creatures, and from these to man. Will those who cannot\r\nanswer our previous inquiries undertake to assert dogmatically in the\r\npresent case at what point in the historical series there is a break\r\nor division? At what step are we to be asked to suppose that the order\r\nof nature was stopped, and a non-natural soul introduced?... The\r\ntheologian is content in the case of individual development of the egg\r\nto admit the fact of individual evolution, and to make assumptions\r\nwhich lie altogether outside the region of scientific inquiry. So,\r\ntoo, it would seem only reasonable that he should deal with the\r\nhistorical series, and frankly accept the natural evolution of man\r\nfrom lower animals, declaring dogmatically, if he so please, but not\r\nas an inference of the same order as are the inferences of science,\r\nthat something called the soul arrived at any point in the series\r\nwhich he may think suitable. At the same time, it would appear to be\r\nsufficient even for the purposes of the theologian, to hold that\r\nwhatever the two above-mentioned series of living thing contain or\r\nimply, they do so as the result of a natural and uniform process of\r\ndevelopment, that there has been one 'miracle' once and for all\r\ntime....\r\n\r\n\"The difficulties which the theologian has to meet when he is called\r\nupon to give some account of the origin and nature of the soul\r\ncertainly cannot be said to have been increased by the establishment\r\nof the Darwinian theory. For from the earliest days of the Church,\r\ningenious speculation has been lavished on the subject.\r\n\r\n\"St. Augustine says (I give a translation of the Latin original):\r\n'With regard to the four following opinions concerning the soul--viz.\r\n(1) whether souls are handed on from parent to child by propagation;\r\nor (2) are suddenly created in individuals at birth; or (3) existing\r\nalready elsewhere are divinely sent into the bodies of the new-born;\r\nor (4) slip into them of their own motion--it is undesirable for\r\nanyone to make a rash pronouncement, since up to the present time the\r\nquestion has never been discussed and decided by catholic writers of\r\nholy books on account of its obscurity and perplexity--or, if it has\r\nbeen dealt with, no such treatises have hitherto come into my hands.'\"\r\n\r\nThere must be many who will be glad to shake off the illusion of\r\nexplanation which is no explanation, and to escape from the futile\r\ndiscussion of the possible behaviour of spirits and ghosts born in the\r\ndreams of primæval savages. They will gladly accept the conclusion\r\nthat the marvellous qualities and activities of living things and that\r\ninscrutable wonder, the mind of man, are outcomes of the orderly\r\nprocess of Nature no less than are the miracles which we call a\r\nbuttercup, a rock crystal, a glacier, the noon-day sun! We can trace,\r\nby observation and inference, the orderly growth and development of\r\nthese things from simpler things; we can discover continuity and\r\ncommon properties determining their diverse existence. But we find no\r\nexplanation of them; we cannot account for the properties of matter\r\nwhich determine them, nor for the existence of anything--whether it be\r\na drop of water, or human thought and consciousness. There are no\r\nspecial and exceptional \"incomprehensibles\" requiring us to assume\r\nthat special \"principles\" or \"spirits\" are concerned with them whilst\r\nthe rest are to be accounted for and explained in a more general way.\r\nWherever we push our inquiries we come equally and inevitably, as did\r\nprimæval man, to that of which there is no explanation--the perpetual\r\nmiracle, the miracle of the nature of things, of existence itself. The\r\nman of science bows his head in the presence of this all-pervading\r\nmystery. He is called arrogant by those who arrogate to themselves the\r\nright to \"explain\" things and to deal in vital spirits and\r\nmetaphysical nostrums for that purpose. From time to time they fill\r\nwith their proclamations the great silence which he has learnt to\r\naccept with reverence and humility. As the years roll on their hollow\r\nphrases are less frequent, and acquire the pathetic interest which\r\nbelongs to all such decaying remnants of the thought and effort of the\r\nchildhood of man.\r\n\r\nIt seems still to be necessary to insist that it is not reasonable to\r\nassume as an indisputable fact that man can arrive at an \"explanation\"\r\nof existence and the nature of things. This assumption has been made\r\nin the past, and, by a well-known trick of advocacy, it has been\r\nargued that since science fails to \"explain\" these things, the old\r\nprehistoric fancies as to spirits--even though they \"explain\" nothing\r\nand have themselves to be \"explained\"--hold the field and must be\r\naccepted as true. There is an alternative, and that is to admit our\r\nignorance. No man has ever seen or knows what is on the other side of\r\nthe moon, that which does not face our earth. There are few amongst us\r\nwho, in this admitted and complete state of ignorance, would persist\r\nin declaring that we must accept as true the suppositions of ancient\r\nraces of men as to the existence there of men-like creatures, or would\r\nbe deluded by the argument that since we do not know what is there the\r\nsuppositions in question must be accepted as true. We cannot, as a\r\nmatter of observation, assert that these supposed beings are not\r\nthere, but we can find no reason to make it appear even probable, nor\r\nany means of proving by experiment, that they are. We refuse to\r\nentertain such suppositions.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: This subject is discussed and some account of the\r\nchemical nature of protoplasm given in my book, \"Science from an Easy\r\nChair\" (Methuen, 1910), which consists of a first series of papers\r\nsimilar to those which are collected in the present volume as a\r\n\"Second Series.\" The chapters in the earlier volume to which I wish to\r\ndirect the reader's attention are those entitled \"The Universal\r\nStructure of Living Things,\" \"Protoplasm, Life and Death,\" \"Chemistry\r\nand Protoplasm,\" \"The Simplest Living Things.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Printed in Great Britain by_\r\n\r\nUNWIN BROTHERS, LIMITED\r\n\r\nWOKING AND LONDON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA FEW OF Messrs.
