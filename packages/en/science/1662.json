Information is raw data from any source that may be\r\nfragmentary, contradictory, unreliable, ambiguous, deceptive, or\r\nwrong. Intelligence is information that has been collected,\r\nintegrated, evaluated, analyzed, and interpreted. Finished\r\nintelligence is the final product of the Intelligence Cycle ready to\r\nbe delivered to the policymaker.\r\n\r\nThere are three types of finished intelligence: basic, current, and\r\nestimative. Basic intelligence is the fundamental and factual\r\nreference material on a country or issue, current intelligence reports\r\non new developments, and estimative intelligence judges probable\r\noutcomes. The three are mutually supporting because basic intelligence\r\nis the foundation on which the other two are based, current\r\nintelligence helps to continually update the knowledge foundation, and\r\nestimative intelligence serves to revise overall interpretations of\r\ncountry and issue prospects for both basic and current intelligence.\r\nThe World Factbook, The President's Daily Brief, and National\r\nIntelligence Estimates are examples of the three types of finished\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\nThe United States has carried on foreign intelligence activities since\r\nthe days of George Washington, but only since World War II have they\r\nbeen coordinated on a governmentwide basis. Three programs have\r\nhighlighted the development of coordinated basic intelligence since\r\nthat time: (1) the Joint Army Navy Intelligence Studies (JANIS), (2)\r\nthe National Intelligence Survey (NIS), and (3) The World Factbook.\r\n\r\nDuring World War II intelligence consumers realized that the\r\nproduction of basic intelligence by different components of the US\r\nGovernment resulted in a great duplication of effort and conflicting\r\ninformation. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 brought home\r\nto Congressional and executive branch leaders the need for integrating\r\nand coordinating departmental reports to national policymakers.\r\nDetailed general information was needed not only on such major powers\r\nas Germany and Japan, but also on places of little previous interest.\r\nIn the Pacific Theater, for example, the Navy and Marines had to\r\nlaunch amphibious operations against many islands about which\r\ninformation was unconfirmed or nonexistent. Intelligence authorities\r\nresolved that the United States should never again be caught\r\nunprepared.\r\n\r\nIn 1943, Gen. George B. Strong (G-2), Adm. H. C. Train (Office of\r\nNaval Intelligence - ONI), and Gen. William J. Donovan (Director of\r\nthe Office of Strategic Services - OSS) decided that a joint effort\r\nshould be initiated. A steering committee was appointed on 27 April\r\n1943 that recommended the formation of a Joint Intelligence Study\r\nPublishing Board to assemble, edit, coordinate, and publish the Joint\r\nArmy Navy Intelligence Studies (JANIS). JANIS was the first\r\ninterdepartmental basic intelligence program and fulfilled the needs\r\nof the US Government for an authoritative and coordinated digest of\r\nstrategic basic intelligence. Between April 1943 and July 1947, the\r\nboard published 34 JANIS studies. JANIS performed well in the war\r\neffort, and numerous letters of commendation were received including a\r\nstatement from Adm. Forrest Sherman, Chief of Staff, Pacific Ocean\r\nAreas, which said \"JANIS has become the indispensable reference work\r\nfor the shore-based planners.\"\r\n\r\nThe need for even more comprehensive basic intelligence in the postwar\r\nworld was well expressed in 1946 by George S. Pettee, a noted author\r\non national security, when he wrote in The Future of American Secret\r\nIntelligence (Infantry Journal Press, 1946, page 46) that world\r\nleadership in peace requires more elaborate intelligence than war.\r\n\"The conduct of peace involves all countries, all human activities-not\r\njust the enemy and his war production.\"\r\n\r\nThe Central Intelligence Agency was established on 26 July 1947 and\r\nofficially began operating 18 September 1947. Effective 1 October\r\n1947, the Director of Central Intelligence assumed operational\r\nresponsibility for JANIS. On 13 January 1948, the National Security\r\nCouncil issued Intelligence Directive (NSCID) No. 3, which officially\r\nauthorized the National Intelligence Survey (NIS) program as a\r\npeacetime replacement for the wartime JANIS program. Before adequate\r\nNIS sections could be produced, it was necessary to develop gazetteers\r\nand maps for an accurate presentation of intelligence by the\r\ncontributing agencies. The US Board on Geographic Names (BGN) compiled\r\nthe names, the Department of the Interior produced the gazetteers, and\r\nCIA produced the maps.\r\n\r\nThe Hoover Commission's Clark Committee, set up in 1954 to study the\r\nstructure and administration of the CIA, reported to Congress in 1955\r\nthat: \"The National Intelligence Survey is an invaluable publication\r\nwhich provides the essential elements of basic intelligence on all\r\nareas of the world. . . . There will always be a continuing\r\nrequirement for keeping the Survey up-to-date.\" The Factbook was\r\ncreated as an annual summary and update to the encyclopedic NIS\r\nstudies. The first classified Factbook was published in August 1962,\r\nand the first unclassified version was published in June 1971. The NIS\r\nprogram was terminated except for the Factbook and gazetteers in 1973.\r\nThe 1975 Factbook was the first to be made available to the public\r\nwith sales through the US Government Printing Office (GPO). The 1996\r\nedition was the first to be printed by GPO. The year 1997 marks the\r\n50th anniversary of the establishment of the Central Intelligence\r\nAgency and the 54th year of continuous basic intelligence support to\r\nthe US Government by The World Factbook and its two predecessor\r\nprograms.\r\n\r\n______________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nNOTES AND DEFINITIONS\r\n\r\nThere have been some significant changes in this edition. A schema or\r\nGuide to Country Profiles has been added. The new maps and flags\r\naccompanying each country profile are in color. The country name Zaire\r\nhas been officially changed to Democratic Republic of the Congo. Congo\r\nis now referred to as Republic of the Congo. New reference maps of the\r\nUnited States, Ethnolinguistic Groups in Afghanistan, and Central\r\nAfrica have been included. Introduction is a new category with two\r\nentries--Current issues and Historical perspective that now appear in\r\nonly a few country profiles, but will be added to all countries in the\r\nfuture. The Area--comparative entry was separated from the Area entry.\r\nThe lowest point and highest point information has been removed from\r\nthe Terrain entry and put into a new entry called Elevation extremes.\r\nThe former Environment entry has been replaced by three new\r\nentries--Natural hazards, Environment--current issues, and\r\nEnvironment--international agreements. US diplomatic representation\r\nhas been renamed Diplomatic representation from the US in order to\r\nparallel the Diplomatic representation in the US entry. The former\r\nAirports entry has been split into three separate entries--Airports,\r\nAirports--with paved runways, and Airports--with unpaved runways. The\r\nDefense category has been renamed Military. The Branches entry has\r\nbeen renamed Military branches. The former Manpower availability entry\r\nhas been replaced by four new entries--Military manpower--military\r\nage, Military manpower--availability, Military manpower--fit for\r\nmilitary service, and Military manpower--reaching military age\r\nannually. The former Defense expenditures entry has been replaced by\r\ntwo new entries--Military expenditures--dollar figure, and Military\r\nexpenditures--percent of GDP. Transnational Issues is a new category\r\nthat now includes only two existing entries (Illicit drugs and\r\nDisputes--international) but additional entries will be considered in\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\nAbbreviations: This information is included in Appendix A:\r\nAbbreviations which includes all abbreviations and acronyms used in\r\nthe Factbook with their expansions.\r\n\r\nAdministrative divisions: This entry generally gives the numbers,\r\ndesignatory terms, and first-order administrative divisions as\r\napproved by the US Board on Geographic Names (BGN). Changes that have\r\nbeen reported but not yet acted on by BGN are noted.\r\n\r\nAge structure: This entry provides the distribution of the population\r\naccording to age. Information is included by sex and age group (0-14\r\nyears, 15-64 years, 65 years and over). The age structure of a\r\npopulation will affect a country's investment pattern. Countries with\r\nyoung populations (high percentage under age 15) need to invest more\r\nin schools, while countries with older populations (high percentage\r\nages 65 and over) need to invest more in the health sector. The age\r\nstructure can also be used to help predict potential political issues.\r\nFor example, the rapid growth of a young adult population unable to\r\nfind employment can lead to unrest.\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: This entry is a rank ordering of major crops\r\nand products starting with the most important.\r\n\r\nAirports: This entry gives the total number of airports. The runway(s)\r\nmay be paved (concrete or asphalt surfaces) or unpaved (grass, dirt,\r\nsand, or gravel surfaces), but must be usable. Not all airports have\r\nfacilities for refueling, maintenance, or air traffic control.\r\n\r\nAirports--with paved runways: This entry gives the total number of\r\nairports with paved runways (concrete or asphalt surfaces). For\r\nairports with more than one runway, only the longest runway is\r\nincluded according to the following five groups--(1) over 3,047 m, (2)\r\n2,438 to 3,047 m, (3) 1,524 to 2,437 m, (4) 914 to 1,523 m, and (5)\r\nunder 914 m. Not all airports have facilities for refueling,\r\nmaintenance, or air traffic control. Only airports with usable runways\r\nare included in this listing.\r\n\r\nAirports--with unpaved runways: This entry gives the total number of\r\nairports with unpaved runways (grass, dirt, sand, or gravel surfaces).\r\nFor airports with more than one runway, only the longest runway is\r\nincluded according to the following five groups--(1) over 3,047 m, (2)\r\n2,438 to 3,047 m, (3) 1,524 to 2,437 m, (4) 914 to 1,523 m, and (5)\r\nunder 914 m. Not all airports have facilities for refueling,\r\nmaintenance, or air traffic control. Only airports with usable runways\r\nare included in this listing.\r\n\r\nAppendixes: This section includes Factbook-related material by topic.\r\nArea: This entry includes three subfields. Total area is the sum of\r\nall land and water areas delimited by international boundaries and/or\r\ncoastlines. Land area is the aggregate of all surfaces delimited by\r\ninternational boundaries and/or coastlines, excluding inland water\r\nbodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers). Water area is the sum of all water\r\nsurfaces delimited by international boundaries and/or coastlines,\r\nincluding inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers).\r\n\r\nArea--comparative: This entry provides an area comparison based on\r\ntotal area equivalents. Most entities are compared with the entire US\r\nor one of the 50 states based on area measurements (1990 revised)\r\nprovided by the US Bureau of the Census. The smaller entities are\r\ncompared with Washington, DC (178 sq km, 69 sq mi) or The Mall in\r\nWashington, DC (0.59 sq km, 0.23 sq mi, 146 acres).\r\n\r\nBirth rate: This entry gives the average annual number of births\r\nduring a year per 1,000 population at midyear; also known as crude\r\nbirth rate. The birth rate is usually the dominant factor in\r\ndetermining the rate of population growth. It depends on both the\r\nlevel of fertility and the age structure of the population.\r\n\r\nBudget: This entry includes revenues, total expenditures, and capital\r\nexpenditures.\r\n\r\nClimate: This entry includes a brief description of typical weather\r\nregimes throughout the year.\r\n\r\nCoastline: This entry gives the total length of the boundary between\r\nthe land area (including islands) and the sea.\r\n\r\nCommunications: This category deals with the means of exchanging\r\ninformation and includes the radio, telephone, and television entries.\r\n\r\nCommunications--note: This entry includes miscellaneous communications\r\ninformation of significance not included elsewhere.\r\n\r\nConstitution: This entry includes the dates of adoption, revisions,\r\nand major amendments.\r\n\r\nCountry map: Most versions of the Factbook provide a country map in\r\ncolor. The maps were produced from the best information available at\r\nthe time of preparation. Names and/or boundaries may have changed\r\nsubsequently.\r\n\r\nCountry name: This entry includes all forms of the country's name\r\napproved by the US Board on Geographic Names (Italy is used as an\r\nexample): conventional long form (Italian Republic), conventional\r\nshort form (Italy), local long form (Repubblica Italiana), local short\r\nform (Italia), former (Kingdom of Italy), as well as the abbreviation.\r\nSee the Terminology note regarding the use of the term \"country.\"\r\n\r\nCurrency: This entry identifies the local medium of exchange and its\r\nbasic subunit.\r\n\r\nCurrent issues: This entry briefly characterizes major geographic,\r\nsocial, political, and military developments in the past 12 months and\r\nmay include a statement about one or two key future trends. This entry\r\nappears for only a few countries at the present time, but will be\r\nadded to all countries in the future.\r\n\r\nData code: This entry gives the official US Government digraph that\r\nprecisely identifies every land entity without overlap, duplication,\r\nor omission. AF, for example, is the data code for Afghanistan. This\r\ntwo-letter country code is a standardized geopolitical data element\r\npromulgated in the Federal Information Processing Standards\r\nPublication (FIPS) 10-4 by the National Institute of Standards and\r\nTechnology at the US Department of Commerce and maintained by the\r\nOffice of the Geographer and Global Issues at the US Department of\r\nState. The data code is used to eliminate confusion and\r\nincompatibility in the collection, processing, and dissemination of\r\narea-specific data and is particularly useful for interchanging data\r\nbetween databases. Appendix F cross-references various country codes\r\nand Appendix G does the same thing for hydrographic codes. Data\r\ncodes-country: This information is presented in Appendix F:\r\nCross-Reference List of Country Data Codes which includes the US\r\nGovernment approved Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS),\r\nthe International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and Internet\r\ncountry codes.\r\n\r\nData codes--hydrographic: This information is presented in Appendix G:\r\nCross-Reference List of Hydrographic Data Codes which includes the\r\nInternational Hydrographic Organization (IHO), Aeronautical Chart and\r\nInformation Center (ACIC; now National Imagery and Mapping Agency or\r\nNIMA), and Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) hydrographic codes. The\r\nUS Government has not yet approved a standard for hydrographic data\r\ncodes similar to the FIPS 10-4 standard for country data codes.\r\n\r\nDates of information: The information cutoff date was 1 January 1997,\r\nalthough a few important changes after that date have been included.\r\nMost demographic statistics are estimates for 1997.\r\n\r\nDeath rate: This entry gives the average annual number of deaths\r\nduring a year per 1,000 population at midyear; also known as crude\r\ndeath rate. The death rate, while only a rough indicator of the\r\nmortality situation in a country, accurately indicates the current\r\nmortality impact on population growth. This indicator is significantly\r\naffected by the age distribution, and most countries will eventually\r\nshow a rise in the rate, in spite of continued declines in mortality\r\nat all ages, as declining fertility results in an aging population.\r\n\r\nDebt--external: This entry gives the total amount of public foreign\r\nfinancial obligations.\r\n\r\nDependency status: This entry describes the formal relationship\r\nbetween a nonindependent entity and a sovereign nation.\r\n\r\nDependent areas: This entry contains an alphabetical listing of all\r\nnonindependent entities associated in some way with a particular\r\nsovereign nation.\r\n\r\nDiplomatic representation: The US Government has diplomatic relations\r\nwith 184 nations, including 178 of the 185 UN members (excluded UN\r\nmembers are Bhutan, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, former Yugoslavia,\r\nand the US itself). In addition, the US has diplomatic relations with\r\n6 nations that are not in the UN--Holy See, Kiribati, Nauru,\r\nSwitzerland, Tonga, and Tuvalu. Diplomatic representation from the US:\r\nThis entry includes the chief of mission, embassy address, mailing\r\naddress, telephone number, FAX number, branch office locations,\r\nconsulate general locations, and consulate locations. Diplomatic\r\nrepresentation in the US: This entry includes the chief of mission,\r\nchancery address, telephone number, FAX number, consulate general\r\nlocations, consulate locations, honorary consulate general locations,\r\nand honorary consulate locations.\r\n\r\nDisputes--international: This entry includes a wide variety of\r\nsituations that range from traditional bilateral boundary disputes to\r\nunilateral claims of one sort or another. Information regarding\r\ndisputes over international terrestrial and maritime boundaries has\r\nbeen reviewed by the US Department of State. References to other\r\nsituations involving borders or frontiers may also be included, such\r\nas resource disputes, geopolitical questions, or irredentist issues,\r\nhowever, inclusion does not necessarily constitute official acceptance\r\nor recognition by the US Government.\r\n\r\nEconomic aid: This entry refers to bilateral commitments of official\r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) and other official flows (OOF). ODA is\r\ndefined as financial assistance which is concessional in character,\r\nhas the main objective to promote economic development and welfare of\r\nLDCs, and contains a grant element of at least 25%. OOF transactions\r\nare also official government assistance, but with a main objective\r\nother than economic development and with a grant element less than\r\n25%. OOF transactions include official export credits (such as Ex-Im\r\nBank credits), official equity and portfolio investment, and debt\r\nreorganization by the official sector that does not meet concessional\r\nterms. Aid is considered to have been committed when agreements are\r\ninitialed by the parties involved and constitute a formal declaration\r\nof intent. The entry is separated into two components--donor and\r\nrecipient.\r\n\r\nEconomy: This category includes the entries dealing with the size,\r\ndevelopment, and management of productive resources, i.e., land,\r\nlabor, and capital.\r\n\r\nEconomy--overview: This entry briefly describes the type of economy,\r\nincluding the degree of market orientation, the level of economic\r\ndevelopment, the most important natural resources, and the unique\r\nareas of specialization. It also characterizes major economic events\r\nand policy changes in the most recent 12 months and may include a\r\nstatement about one or two key future macroeconomic trends.\r\n\r\nElectricity--capacity: This entry gives the maximum designed potential\r\nfor electricity production expressed in kilowatts.\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption per capita: This entry gives the figure for\r\nannual electricity generation plus net imports or minus net exports,\r\ndivided by total population for the same year expressed in kilowatt\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: This entry gives the annual amount of\r\nelectricity actually generated expressed in kilowatt hours.\r\n\r\nElevation extremes: This entry includes both the highest point and the\r\nlowest point.\r\n\r\nEntities: Some of the nations, dependent areas, areas of special\r\nsovereignty, and governments included in this publication are not\r\nindependent, and others are not officially recognized by the US\r\nGovernment. \"Nation\" refers to a people politically organized into a\r\nsovereign state with a definite territory. \"Dependent area\" refers to\r\na broad category of political entities that are associated in some way\r\nwith a nation. \"Country\" names used in the table of contents or for\r\npage headings are usually the short-form names as approved by the US\r\nBoard on Geographic Names and may include nations, dependencies, or\r\nother geographic entities. There are a total of 266 separate\r\ngeographic entities in The World Factbook that may be categorized as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nNATIONS\r\n\r\n184 nations that are UN members (excluding the former Yugoslavia,\r\nwhich is still counted by the UN)\r\n7 nations that are not members of the UN--Holy See, Kiribati, Nauru,\r\nSerbia and Montenegro, Switzerland, Tonga, Tuvalu\r\n\r\nOTHER\r\n\r\n1 Taiwan\r\n\r\nDEPENDENT AREAS\r\n\r\n6 Australian dependencies--Ashmore and Cartier Islands, Christmas\r\nIsland, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Coral Sea Islands, Heard Island and\r\nMcDonald Islands, Norfolk Island\r\n2 Danish dependencies--Faroe Islands, Greenland\r\n2 Dutch dependencies--Aruba, Netherlands Antilles\r\n16 French dependencies--Bassas da India, Clipperton Island, Europa\r\nIsland, French Guiana, French Polynesia, French Southern and Antarctic\r\nLands, Glorioso Islands, Guadeloupe, Juan de Nova Island, Martinique,\r\nMayotte, New Caledonia, Reunion, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, Tromelin\r\nIsland, Wallis and Futuna\r\n3 New Zealand dependencies--Cook Islands, Niue, Tokelau\r\n3 Norwegian dependencies--Bouvet Island, Jan Mayen, Svalbard\r\n1 Portuguese dependency--Macau\r\n16 UK dependencies--Anguilla, Bermuda, British Indian Ocean Territory,\r\nBritish Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Falkland Islands, Gibraltar,\r\nGuernsey, Hong Kong, Jersey, Isle of Man, Montserrat, Pitcairn\r\nIslands, Saint Helena, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands,\r\nTurks and Caicos Islands\r\n14 US dependencies--American Samoa, Baker Island, Guam, Howland\r\nIsland, Jarvis Island, Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, Midway Islands,\r\nNavassa Island, Northern Mariana Islands, Palmyra Atoll, Puerto Rico,\r\nVirgin Islands, Wake Island\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS\r\n\r\n  6 Antarctica, Gaza Strip, Paracel Islands, Spratly Islands, West\r\nBank, Western Sahara\r\n\r\nOTHER ENTITIES\r\n\r\n  4 oceans--Arctic Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Pacific Ocean\r\n  1 World\r\n__________\r\n\r\n266 Total\r\n\r\nEnvironment--current issues: This entry lists the most pressing and\r\nimportant environmental problems.\r\n\r\nEnvironment--international agreements: This entry separates country\r\nparticipation in international environmental agreements into two\r\nlevels--party to and signed but not ratified. Agreements are listed in\r\nalphabetical order by the abbreviated form of the full name.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental agreements: This information is presented in Appendix D:\r\nSelected International Environmental Agreements which includes the\r\nname, abbreviation, date opened for signature, date entered into\r\nforce, objective, and parties by category.\r\n\r\nEthnic groups: This entry provides a rank ordering of ethnic groups\r\nstarting with the largest and sometimes includes the percent of total\r\npopulation. Exchange rates: This entry provides the official value of\r\na nation's monetary unit at a given date or over a given period of\r\ntime, as expressed in units of local currency per US dollar and as\r\ndetermined by international market forces or official fiat.\r\n\r\nExecutive branch: This entry includes several subfields. Chief of\r\nstate includes the name and title of the titular leader of the country\r\nwho represents the state at official and ceremonial functions but may\r\nnot be involved with the day-to-day activities of the government. Head\r\nof government includes the name and title of the administrative leader\r\nwho is designated to manage the day-to-day activities of the\r\ngovernment. Cabinet includes the official name for this body of\r\nadvisers and the method of selection for members. Elections includes\r\nthe nature of election process or accession to power, date of the last\r\nelection, and date of the next election. Election results includes the\r\npercent of vote for each candidate in the last election. In the UK,\r\nthe monarch is the chief of state, and the prime minister is the head\r\nof government. In the US, the President is both the chief of state and\r\nthe head of government.\r\n\r\nExports: This entry includes three subfields. Total value is the total\r\nUS dollar amount of exports on an f.o.b. basis. Commodities is a rank\r\nordering of exported products starting with the most important and\r\nsometimes includes the percent of dollar value. Partners is a rank\r\nordering of trading partners starting with the most important and\r\nsometimes includes the percent of dollar value.\r\n\r\nFiscal year: This entry identifies the beginning and ending months for\r\na country's accounting period of 12 months, which often is the\r\ncalendar year but may begin in any month. FY93/94 refers to the fiscal\r\nyear that began in calendar year 1993 and ended in calendar year 1994.\r\nAll yearly references are for the calendar year (CY) unless indicated\r\nas a noncalendar fiscal year (FY).\r\n\r\nFlag description: This entry provides a written flag description\r\nproduced from actual flags or the best information available at the\r\ntime the entry was written. The flags of independent nations are used\r\nby their dependencies unless there is an officially recognized local\r\nflag. Some disputed and other areas do not have flags.\r\n\r\nFlag graphic: Most versions of the Factbook provide a color flag\r\navailable at the beginning of the country entry. The flag graphics\r\nwere produced from actual flags or the best information available at\r\nthe time of preparation. The flags of independent nations are used by\r\ntheir dependencies unless there is an officially recognized local\r\nflag. Some disputed and other areas do not have flags.\r\n\r\nGDP: This entry gives the gross domestic product (GDP) or value of all\r\nfinal goods and services produced within a nation in a given year. GDP\r\ndollar estimates in the Factbook are derived from purchasing power\r\nparity (PPP) calculations. See the note on GDP methodology for more\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nGDP methodology: In the Economy section, GDP dollar estimates for all\r\ncountries are derived from purchasing power parity (PPP) calculations\r\nrather than from conversions at official currency exchange rates. The\r\nPPP method involves the use of standardized international dollar price\r\nweights, which are applied to the quantities of final goods and\r\nservices produced in a given economy. The data derived from the PPP\r\nmethod provide a better comparison of economic well-being between\r\ncountries. The division of a GDP estimate in domestic currency by the\r\ncorresponding PPP estimate in dollars gives the PPP conversion rate.\r\nWhen converted at PPP rates, $1,000 will buy the same market basket of\r\ngoods in any country. Whereas PPP estimates for OECD countries are\r\nquite reliable, PPP estimates for developing countries are often rough\r\napproximations. Most of the GDP estimates are based on extrapolation\r\nof PPP numbers published by the UN International Comparison Program\r\n(UNICP) and by Professors Robert Summers and Alan Heston of the\r\nUniversity of Pennsylvania and their colleagues. In contrast, currency\r\nexchange rates depend on a variety of international and domestic\r\nfinancial forces that often have little relation to domestic output.\r\nIn developing countries with weak currencies the exchange rate\r\nestimate of GDP in dollars is typically one-fourth to one-half the PPP\r\nestimate. Furthermore, exchange rates may suddenly go up or down by\r\n10% or more because of market forces or official fiat whereas real\r\noutput has remained unchanged. On 12 January 1994, for example, the 14\r\ncountries of the African Financial Community (whose currencies are\r\ntied to the French franc) devalued their currencies by 50%. This move,\r\nof course, did not cut the real output of these countries by half. One\r\nimportant caution: the proportion of, say, defense expenditures as a\r\npercentage of GDP in local currency accounts may differ substantially\r\nfrom the proportion when GDP accounts are expressed in PPP terms, as,\r\nfor example, when an observer tries to estimate the dollar level of\r\nRussian or Japanese military expenditures. Note: the numbers for GDP\r\nand other economic data can not be chained together from successive\r\nvolumes of the Factbook because of changes in the US dollar measuring\r\nrod, revisions of data by statistical agencies, use of new or\r\ndifferent sources of information, and changes in national statistical\r\nmethods and practices. For statistical series on GDP and other\r\neconomic variables, see the [1]Handbook of International Economic\r\nStatistics available from the same sources as The World Factbook.\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector: This entry gives the percentage\r\ncontribution of agriculture, industry, and services to total GDP.\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: This entry shows GDP on a purchasing power parity\r\nbasis divided by population as of 1 July for the same year.\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: This entry gives GDP growth on an annual basis\r\nadjusted for inflation and expressed as a percent.\r\n\r\nGeographic coordinates: This entry includes rounded latitude and\r\nlongitude for finding purposes of the approximate geographic center of\r\nthe country and is based on the Gazetteer of Conventional Names, Third\r\nEdition, August 1988, US Board on Geographic Names and on other\r\nsources.\r\n\r\nGeographic names: This information is presented in Appendix H:\r\nCross-Reference List of Geographic Names which indicates where various\r\ngeographic names--including the location of all US Foreign Service\r\nPosts, alternate names of countries, former names, and political or\r\ngeographical portions of larger entities--can be found in The World\r\nFactbook. Spellings are normally, but not always, those approved by\r\nthe US Board on Geographic Names (BGN). Alternate names are included\r\nin parentheses, while additional information is included in brackets.\r\n\r\nGeography: This category includes the entries dealing with the natural\r\nenvironment and the effects of human activity.\r\n\r\nGeography--note: This entry includes miscellaneous geographic\r\ninformation of significance not included elsewhere.\r\n\r\nGNP: Gross national product (GNP) is the value of all final goods and\r\nservices produced within a nation in a given year, plus income earned\r\nby its citizens abroad, minus income earned by foreigners from\r\ndomestic production. The Factbook uses GDP rather than GNP to measure\r\nnational production.\r\n\r\nGovernment: This category includes the entries dealing with the system\r\nfor the adoption and administration of public policy.\r\n\r\nGovernment type: This entry gives the basic form of government (e.g.,\r\nrepublic, constitutional monarchy, federal republic, parliamentary\r\ndemocracy, military dictatorship).\r\n\r\nGovernment--note: This entry includes miscellaneous government\r\ninformation of significance not included elsewhere.\r\n\r\nGross domestic product: see GDP\r\n\r\nGross national product: see GNP\r\n\r\nGross world product: see GWP\r\n\r\nGWP: This entry gives the gross world product (GWP) or aggregate value\r\nof all final goods and services produced worldwide in a given year.\r\n\r\nHeliports: This entry gives the total number of helicopter takeoff and\r\nlanding sites (which may or may not have fuel or other services).\r\n\r\nHighways: This entry includes the total length of the highway system\r\nas well as the length of the paved and unpaved components.\r\n\r\nHistorical perspective: This entry contains a brief summary of the\r\nbackground information necessary to understand the current situation\r\nin a country. The entry appears for only a few countries at the\r\npresent time, but will be added to all countries in the future.\r\n\r\nIllicit drugs: This entry gives information on the five categories of\r\nillicit drugs--narcotics, stimulants, depressants (sedatives),\r\nhallucinogens, and cannabis. These categories include many drugs\r\nlegally produced and prescribed by doctors as well as those illegally\r\nproduced and sold outside of medical channels.\r\n\r\nCannabis (Cannabis sativa) is the common hemp plant, which provides\r\nhallucinogens with some sedative properties, and includes marijuana\r\n(pot, Acapulco gold, grass, reefer), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC,\r\nMarinol), hashish (hash), and hashish oil (hash oil).\r\n\r\nCoca (mostly Erythroxylum coca) is a bush with leaves that contain the\r\nstimulant used to make cocaine. Coca is not to be confused with cocoa,\r\nwhich comes from cacao seeds and is used in making chocolate, cocoa,\r\nand cocoa butter.\r\n\r\nCocaine is a stimulant derived from the leaves of the coca bush.\r\n\r\nDepressants (sedatives) are drugs that reduce tension and anxiety and\r\ninclude chloral hydrate, barbiturates (Amytal, Nembutal, Seconal,\r\nphenobarbital), benzodiazepines (Librium, Valium), methaqualone\r\n(Quaalude), glutethimide (Doriden), and others (Equanil, Placidyl,\r\nValmid).\r\n\r\nDrugs are any chemical substances that effect a physical, mental,\r\nemotional, or behavioral change in an individual.\r\n\r\nDrug abuse is the use of any licit or illicit chemical substance that\r\nresults in physical, mental, emotional, or behavioral impairment in an\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\nHallucinogens are drugs that affect sensation, thinking,\r\nself-awareness, and emotion. Hallucinogens include LSD (acid,\r\nmicrodot), mescaline and peyote (mexc, buttons, cactus), amphetamine\r\nvariants (PMA, STP, DOB), phencyclidine (PCP, angel dust, hog),\r\nphencyclidine analogues (PCE, PCPy, TCP), and others (psilocybin,\r\npsilocyn).\r\n\r\nHashish is the resinous exudate of the cannabis or hemp plant\r\n(Cannabis sativa).\r\n\r\nHeroin is a semisynthetic derivative of morphine.\r\n\r\nMandrax is a trade name for methaqualone, a pharmaceutical depressant.\r\n\r\nMarijuana is the dried leaves of the cannabis or hemp plant (Cannabis\r\nsativa).\r\n\r\nMethaqualone is a pharmaceutical depressant, referred to as mandrax in\r\nSouthwest Asia.\r\n\r\nNarcotics are drugs that relieve pain, often induce sleep, and refer\r\nto opium, opium derivatives, and synthetic substitutes. Natural\r\nnarcotics include opium (paregoric, parepectolin), morphine\r\n(MS-Contin, Roxanol), codeine (Tylenol with codeine, Empirin with\r\ncodeine, Robitussan AC), and thebaine. Semisynthetic narcotics include\r\nheroin (horse, smack), and hydromorphone (Dilaudid). Synthetic\r\nnarcotics include meperidine or Pethidine (Demerol, Mepergan),\r\nmethadone (Dolophine, Methadose), and others (Darvon, Lomotil).\r\n\r\nOpium is the brown, gummy exudate of the incised, unripe seedpod of\r\nthe opium poppy.\r\n\r\nOpium poppy (Papaver somniferum) is the source for the natural and\r\nsemisynthetic narcotics.\r\n\r\nPoppy straw concentrate is the alkaloid derived from the mature dried\r\nopium poppy.\r\n\r\nQat (kat, khat) is a stimulant from the buds or leaves of Catha edulis\r\nthat is chewed or drunk as tea.\r\n\r\nQuaaludes is the North American slang term for methaqualone, a\r\npharmaceutical depressant.\r\n\r\nImports: This entry includes three subfields. Total value is the total\r\nUS dollar amount of imports on a c.i.f. or f.o.b. basis. Commodities\r\nis a rank ordering of imported products starting with the most\r\nimportant and sometimes includes the percent of dollar value. Partners\r\nis a rank ordering of trading partners starting with the most\r\nimportant and sometimes includes the percent of dollar value.\r\n\r\nIndependence: This entry gives the date that sovereignty was achieved\r\nand from what nation.\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: This entry gives the annual\r\npercentage increase in industrial production (includes manufacturing,\r\nmining, and construction).\r\n\r\nIndustries: This entry provides a rank ordering of industries starting\r\nwith the largest by value of annual output.\r\n\r\nInfant mortality rate: This entry gives the number of deaths of\r\ninfants under one year old in a given year per 1,000 live births\r\noccurring in the same year. The infant mortality rate is often used an\r\nindicator of the level of health in a country.\r\n\r\nInflation rate-consumer price index: This entry furnishes the annual\r\npercent change in consumer prices compared with the previous year's\r\nconsumer prices.\r\n\r\nInternational disputes: see Disputes--international\r\n\r\nInternational organization participation: This entry lists in\r\nalphabetical order by abbreviation those international organizations\r\nin which the subject country is a member or participates in some other\r\nway.\r\n\r\nInternational organizations: This information is presented in Appendix\r\nC: International Organizations and Groups which includes the name,\r\nabbreviation, address, telephone, FAX, date established, aim, and\r\nmembers by category.\r\n\r\nIntroduction: This category includes two entries--Current issues and\r\nHistorical perspective.\r\n\r\nIrrigated land: This entry gives the number of square kilometers of\r\nland area that is artificially supplied with water.\r\n\r\nJudicial branch: This entry contains the name(s) of the highest\r\ncourt(s) and a brief description of the selection process for members.\r\n\r\nLabor force: This entry contains the total labor force figure and a\r\nrank ordering of component parts by occupation.\r\n\r\nLand boundaries: This entry contains the total length of all land\r\nboundaries and the individual lengths for each of the contiguous\r\nborder countries.\r\n\r\nLand use: This entry contains the percentage shares of total land area\r\nfor five different types of land use. Arable land--land cultivated for\r\ncrops that are replanted after each harvest like wheat, maize, and\r\nrice. Permanent crops--land cultivated for crops that are not\r\nreplanted after each harvest like citrus, coffee, and rubber.\r\nPermanent pastures--land permanently used for herbaceous forage crops.\r\nForests and woodland--land under dense or open stands of trees.\r\nOther--any land type not specifically mentioned above like urban\r\nareas, roads, desert, etc.\r\n\r\nLanguages: This entry provides a rank ordering of languages starting\r\nwith the largest and sometimes includes the percent of total\r\npopulation speaking that language.\r\n\r\nLegal system: This entry contains a brief description of the legal\r\nsystem's historical roots, role in government, and acceptance of\r\nInternational Court of Justice (ICJ) jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nLegislative branch: This entry contains information on the structure\r\n(unicameral, bicameral, tricameral), formal name, number of seats, and\r\nterm of office. Elections includes the nature of election process or\r\naccession to power, date of the last election, and date of the next\r\nelection. Election results includes the percent of vote and/or number\r\nof seats held by each party in the last election.\r\n\r\nLife expectancy at birth: This entry contains the average number of\r\nyears to be lived by a group of people born in the same year, if\r\nmortality at each age remains constant in the future. The entry\r\nincludes total population as well as the male and female components.\r\nLife expectancy at birth is also a measure of overall quality of life\r\nin a country and summarizes the mortality at all ages. It can also be\r\nthought of as indicating the potential return on investment in human\r\ncapital, and is necessary for the calculation of various actuarial\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\nLiteracy: This entry includes a definition of literacy and Census\r\nBureau percentages for the total population, males, and females. There\r\nare no universal definitions and standards of literacy. Unless\r\notherwise specified, all rates are based on the most common\r\ndefinition--the ability to read and write at a specified age.\r\nDetailing the standards that individual countries use to assess the\r\nability to read and write is beyond the scope of the Factbook.\r\nInformation on literacy, while not a perfect measure of educational\r\nresults, is probably the most easily available and valid for\r\ninternational comparisons. Low levels of literacy, and education in\r\ngeneral, can impede the economic development of a country in the\r\ncurrent rapidly changing, technology-driven world.\r\n\r\nLocation: This entry identifies the country's regional location,\r\nneighboring countries, and adjacent bodies of water.\r\n\r\nMap references: This entry includes the name of the Factbook reference\r\nmap on which a country may be found. The entry on Geographic\r\ncoordinates may be helpful in finding some smaller countries.\r\n\r\nMaritime claims: This entry includes the following claims: contiguous\r\nzone, continental shelf, exclusive economic zone, exclusive fishing\r\nzone, extended fishing zone, none (usually for a landlocked country),\r\nother (unique maritime claims like Libya's Gulf of Sidra Closing Line\r\nor North Korea's Military Boundary Line), and territorial sea. The\r\nproximity of neighboring states may prevent some national claims from\r\nbeing extended the full distance.\r\n\r\nMerchant marine: Merchant marine may be defined as all ships engaged\r\nin the carriage of goods; all commercial vessels (as opposed to all\r\nnonmilitary ships) which excludes tugs, fishing vessels, offshore oil\r\nrigs, etc.; or a grouping of merchant ships by nationality or\r\nregister. This entry contains information in two subfields--total and\r\nships by type. Total includes the total number of ships (1,000 GRT or\r\nover), total DWT for all ships, and total GRT for all ships. Ships by\r\ntype includes a listing of barge carriers, bulk cargo ships, cargo\r\nships, combination bulk carriers, combination ore/oil carriers,\r\ncontainer ships, intermodal ships, liquefied gas tankers, livestock\r\ncarriers, multifunction large-load carriers, oil tankers, passenger\r\nships, passenger-cargo ships, railcar carriers, refrigerated cargo\r\nships, roll-on/roll-off cargo ships, short-sea passenger ships,\r\nspecialized tankers, tanker tug-barges, and vehicle carriers.\r\n\r\nCaptive register is a register of ships maintained by a territory,\r\npossession, or colony primarily or exclusively for the use of ships\r\nowned in the parent country; also referred to as an offshore register,\r\nthe offshore equivalent of an internal register. Ships on a captive\r\nregister will fly the same flag as the parent country, or a local\r\nvariant of it, but will be subject to the maritime laws and taxation\r\nrules of the offshore territory. Although the nature of a captive\r\nregister makes it especially desirable for ships owned in the parent\r\ncountry, just as in the internal register, the ships may also be owned\r\nabroad. The captive register then acts as a flag of convenience\r\nregister, except that it is not the register of an independent state.\r\n\r\nFlag of convenience register is a national register offering\r\nregistration to a merchant ship not owned in the flag state. The major\r\nflags of convenience (FOC) attract ships to their registers by virtue\r\nof low fees, low or nonexistent taxation of profits, and liberal\r\nmanning requirements. True FOC registers are characterized by having\r\nrelatively few of the registered ships actually owned in the flag\r\nstate. Thus, while virtually any flag can be used for ships under a\r\ngiven set of circumstances, an FOC register is one where the majority\r\nof the merchant fleet is owned abroad. It is also referred to as an\r\nopen register.\r\n\r\nFlag state is the nation in which a ship is registered and which holds\r\nlegal jurisdiction over operation of the ship, whether at home or\r\nabroad. Maritime legislation of the flag state determines how a ship\r\nis crewed and taxed and whether a foreign-owned ship may be placed on\r\nthe register.\r\n\r\nInternal register is a register of ships maintained as a subset of a\r\nnational register. Ships on the internal register fly the national\r\nflag and have that nationality but are subject to a separate set of\r\nmaritime rules from those on the main national register. These\r\ndifferences usually include lower taxation of profits, use of foreign\r\nnationals as crew members, and, usually, ownership outside the flag\r\nstate (when it functions as an FOC register). The Norwegian\r\nInternational Ship Register and Danish International Ship Register are\r\nthe most notable examples of an internal register. Both have been\r\ninstrumental in stemming flight from the national flag to flags of\r\nconvenience and in attracting foreign-owned ships to the Norwegian and\r\nDanish flags.\r\n\r\nMerchant ship is a vessel that carries goods against payment of\r\nfreight; commonly used to denote any nonmilitary ship but accurately\r\nrestricted to commercial vessels only.\r\n\r\nRegister is the record of a ship's ownership and nationality as listed\r\nwith the maritime authorities of a country; also, the compendium of\r\nsuch individual ships' registrations. Registration of a ship provides\r\nit with a nationality and makes it subject to the laws of the country\r\nin which registered (the flag state) regardless of the nationality of\r\nthe ship's ultimate owner.\r\n\r\nMilitary: This category includes the entries dealing with a country's\r\nmilitary structure, manpower, and expenditures.\r\n\r\nMilitary branches: This entry lists the names of the ground, naval,\r\nair, marine, and other defense or military-type forces.\r\n\r\nMilitary expenditures--dollar figure: This entry gives current\r\nmilitary expenditures in US dollars; the figure is calculated by\r\nmultiplying the estimated defense spending in percentage terms by the\r\ngross domestic product (GDP) in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms.\r\nThe figure should be treated with caution because of different price\r\npatterns and accounting methods among nations.\r\n\r\nMilitary expenditures--percent of GDP: This entry gives current\r\nmilitary expenditures as an estimated percent of gross domestic\r\nproduct (GDP).\r\n\r\nMilitary manpower--availability: This entry gives the total numbers of\r\nmales and females age 15-49 and assumes that every individual is fit\r\nto serve.\r\n\r\nMilitary manpower--fit for military service: This entry gives the\r\nnumber of males and females age 15-49 fit for military service. This\r\nis a more refined measure of potential military manpower availability\r\nwhich tries to correct for the health situation in the country and\r\nreduces the maximum potential number to a more realistic estimate of\r\nthe actual number fit to serve.\r\n\r\nMilitary manpower--military age: This entry gives the minimum age at\r\nwhich an individual may volunteer for military service or be subject\r\nto conscription.\r\n\r\nMilitary manpower--reaching military age annually: This entry gives\r\nthe number of draft-age males and females entering the military\r\nmanpower pool in any given year and is a measure of the availability\r\nof draft-age young adults.\r\n\r\nMilitary--note: This entry includes miscellaneous military information\r\nof significance not included elsewhere.\r\n\r\nMoney figures: All money figures are expressed in contemporaneous US\r\ndollars unless otherwise indicated.\r\n\r\nNational capital: This entry gives the location of the seat of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nNational holiday: This entry gives the primary national day of\r\ncelebration--usually independence day.\r\n\r\nNationality: This entry provides the identifying terms for\r\ncitizens--noun and adjective.\r\n\r\nNatural hazards: This entry lists potential natural disasters.\r\n\r\nNatural resources: This entry lists a country's mineral, petroleum,\r\nhydropower, and other resources of commercial importance.\r\n\r\nNet migration rate: This entry includes the figure for the difference\r\nbetween the number of persons entering and leaving a country during\r\nthe year per 1,000 persons (based on midyear population). An excess of\r\npersons entering the country is referred to as net immigration (e.g.,\r\n3.56 migrants/1,000 population); an excess of persons leaving the\r\ncountry as net emigration (e.g., -9.26 migrants/1,000 population). The\r\nnet migration rate indicates the contribution of migration to the\r\noverall level of population change. High levels of migration can cause\r\nproblems such as increasing unemployment and potential ethnic strife\r\n(if people are coming in) or reducing the labor force, perhaps in\r\ncertain key sectors (if people are leaving).\r\n\r\nPeople: This category includes the entries dealing with the\r\ncharacteristics of the people and their society.\r\n\r\nPeople--note: This entry includes miscellaneous demographic\r\ninformation of significance not included elsewhere.\r\n\r\nPipelines: This entry gives the lengths and types of pipelines for\r\ntransporting products like natural gas, crude oil, or petroleum\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\nPolitical parties and leaders: This entry includes a listing of\r\npolitical organizations and their leaders.\r\n\r\nPolitical pressure groups and leaders: This entry includes a listing\r\nof organizations with leaders involved in politics, but not standing\r\nfor legislative election.\r\n\r\nPopulation: This entry gives an estimate from the US Bureau of the\r\nCensus based on statistics from population censuses, vital statistics\r\nregistration systems, or sample surveys pertaining to the recent past,\r\nand on assumptions about future trends. Starting with the 1993\r\nFactbook, demographic estimates for some countries (mostly African)\r\nhave taken into account the effects of the growing incidence of AIDS\r\ninfections; in 1997 these countries were Botswana, Brazil, Burkina\r\nFaso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Republic of the\r\nCongo, Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Guyana, Haiti, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi,\r\nNigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Thailand, Uganda, Zaire which\r\nis now known as Democratic Republic of the Congo, Zambia, and\r\nZimbabwe. The total population presents one overall measure of the\r\npotential impact of the country on the world and within its region.\r\n\r\nPopulation growth rate: The average annual percent change in the\r\npopulation, resulting from a surplus (or deficit) of births over\r\ndeaths and the balance of migrants entering and leaving a country. The\r\nrate may be positive or negative. Also known as growth rate or average\r\nannual rate of growth. The growth rate is a factor in determining how\r\nrapidly a country responds to the changing needs of its people in\r\nterms of infrastructure (e.g., schools, hospitals, housing, roads),\r\nresources (e.g., food, water, electricity), and jobs. Rapid population\r\ngrowth can also be seen as threatening by neighboring countries.\r\n\r\nPorts and harbors: This entry lists a few ports and harbors selected\r\non the basis of overall importance to each country. This is determined\r\nby evaluating a number of factors (e.g., dollar value of goods\r\nhandled, gross tonnage, facilities, military significance).\r\n\r\nRadio broadcast stations: This entry includes the total number of AM,\r\nFM, and shortwave broadcast stations.\r\n\r\nRadios: This entry gives the total number of radio receivers.\r\n\r\nRailways: This entry includes the total length of the railway network\r\nand component parts by gauge: broad, dual, narrow, standard, and\r\nother.\r\n\r\nReference maps: This section includes world, regional, and special or\r\ncurrent interest maps.\r\n\r\nReligions: This entry includes a rank ordering of religions starting\r\nwith the largest and sometimes includes the percent of total\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nSex ratio: This entry includes the number of males for each female in\r\nfive age groups-at birth, under 15 years, 15-64 years, 65 years and\r\nover, and for the total population. Sex ratio at birth has recently\r\nemerged as an indicator of certain kinds of sex discrimination in some\r\ncountries. For instance, high sex ratios at birth in some Asian\r\ncountries are now attributed to sex-selective abortion and infanticide\r\ndue to a strong preference for sons. This will affect future marriage\r\npatterns and fertility patterns and could cause unrest among young\r\nadult males who are unable to find partners. The sex ratio at birth\r\nfor the World is 1.06 (1997 est.).\r\n\r\nSuffrage: This entry gives the age at enfranchisement and whether the\r\nright to vote is universal or restricted.\r\n\r\nTelephone numbers: All telephone numbers in the Factbook consist of\r\nthe country code in brackets, the city or area code (where required)\r\nin parentheses, and the local number. The one component that is not\r\npresented is the international access code which varies from country\r\nto country. For example, an international direct dial telephone call\r\nplaced from the US to Madrid, Spain, would be as follows:\r\n\r\n011 [34] (1) 577-xxxx where\r\n011 is the international access code for station-to-station calls\r\n(01 is for calls other than station-to-station calls),\r\n[34] is the country code for Spain,\r\n(1) is the city code for Madrid,\r\n577 is the local exchange, and\r\nxxxx is the local telephone number.\r\n\r\nAn international direct dial telephone call placed from another\r\ncountry to the US would be as follows:\r\n\r\nAn international direct dial telephone call placed from another\r\ncountry to the US would be as follows:\r\n\r\n[1] is the country code for the US,\r\n(202) is the area code for Washington, DC,\r\n939 is the local exchange, and\r\nxxxx is the local telephone number.\r\n\r\nTelephone system: This entry includes a brief characterization of the\r\nsystem with details on the domestic and international components.

Economic considerations have played second fiddle to political\r\nand military upheavals during more than 17 years of war, including the\r\nnearly 10-year Soviet military occupation (which ended 15 February\r\n1989). During the war one-third of the population fled the country,\r\nwith Pakistan and Iran sheltering a combined peak of more than 6\r\nmillion refugees. Now, only 750,000 registered Afghan refugees remain\r\nin Pakistan and about 1.2 million in Iran. Another 1 million have\r\nprobably moved into and around urban areas within Afghanistan. Gross\r\ndomestic product has fallen substantially over the past 17 years\r\nbecause of the loss of labor and capital and the disruption of trade\r\nand transport. Millions of people continue to suffer from insufficient\r\nfood, clothing, housing, and medical care. Inflation remains a serious\r\nproblem throughout the country, with one estimate putting the rate at\r\n240% in Kabul in 1996.

The economy rebounded in 1993-95 after a severe depression\r\naccompanying the collapse of the previous centrally planned system in\r\n1990 and 1991. However, a weakening of government resolve to maintain\r\nstabilization policies in the election year of 1996 contributed to\r\nrenewal of inflationary pressures, spurred by the budget deficit which\r\nexceeded 12%. The collapse of financial pyramid schemes in early 1997\r\n- which had attracted deposits from a substantial portion of Albania's\r\nadult population - triggered unrest in much of the south in early\r\n1997. The economy continues to be buoyed by remittances of some 20% of\r\nthe labor force which works abroad, mostly in Greece and Italy. These\r\nremittances supplement GDP and help offset the large foreign trade\r\ndeficit. Most agricultural land was privatized in 1992, substantially\r\nimproving peasant incomes. Overall economic performance is likely to\r\nbe substantially worse in 1997; inflation will easily top 50% and GDP\r\nmay drop by 5% or more.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $4.4 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 5% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $1,290 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 56%\r\nindustry: 21%\r\nservices: 23% (1995)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 17.4% (1996)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 1.692 million (1994 est.)

Algiers' efforts\r\nto reform one of the most centrally planned economies in the Arab\r\nworld began after the 1986 collapse of world oil prices plunged the\r\ncountry into a severe recession. In 1989, the government launched a\r\ncomprehensive, IMF-supported program to achieve economic stabilization\r\nand to introduce market mechanisms into the economy. Despite\r\nsubstantial progress toward economic adjustment, in 1992 the reform\r\ndrive stalled as Algiers became embroiled in political turmoil. In\r\nSeptember 1993, a new government was formed, and one priority was the\r\nresumption and acceleration of the structural adjustment process.\r\nBuffeted by the slump in world oil prices and burdened with a heavy\r\nforeign debt, Algiers concluded a one-year standby arrangement with\r\nthe IMF in April 1994. Following a Paris Club debt rescheduling in\r\n1995, a robust harvest, and elevated oil prices, the economy\r\nexperienced a strong recovery and key economic improvements.

Tuna fishing and tuna processing plants are the backbone of the\r\nprivate sector, with canned tuna the primary export. The tuna\r\ncanneries and the government are by far the two largest employers.\r\nOther economic activities include a slowly developing tourist\r\nindustry. Transfers from the US Government add substantially to\r\nAmerican Samoa's economic well-being. According to one observer,\r\nattempts by the government to develop a larger and broader economy are\r\nrestrained by Samoa's remote location, its limited transportation, and\r\nits devastating hurricanes.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $128 million (1991 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $2,600 (1991 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture : NA%\r\nindustry: NA%\r\nservices: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: NA %\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 14,400 (1990)\r\nby occupation: government 33%, tuna canneries 34%, other 33% (1990)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 12% (1991)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $97 million ($43 million in local revenue and $54 million in\r\ngrant revenue)\r\nexpenditures: $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA (FY90/91)\r\n\r\nIndustries: tuna canneries (largely dependent on foreign fishing\r\nvessels), handicrafts\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 33,000 kW (1993)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 100 million kWh (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 1,743 kWh (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: bananas, coconuts, vegetables, taro,\r\nbreadfruit, yams, copra, pineapples, papayas;

An estimated 10\r\nmillion tourists visit annually, attracted by Andorra's duty-free\r\nstatus and by its summer and winter resorts. Andorra's comparative\r\nadvantage has recently eroded as the economies of neighboring France\r\nand Spain have been opened up, providing broader availability of goods\r\nand lower tariffs. The banking sector, with its \"tax haven\" status,\r\nalso contributes substantially to the economy. Agricultural production\r\nis limited by a scarcity of arable land, and most food has to be\r\nimported. The principal livestock activity is sheep raising.\r\nManufacturing consists mainly of cigarettes, cigars, and furniture.\r\nAndorra is a member of the EU Customs Union and is treated as an EU\r\nmember for trade in manufactured goods (no tariffs) and as a non-EU\r\nmember for agricultural products.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $1.2 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $18,000 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: NA%\r\nindustry: NA%\r\nservices: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: NA%\r\n\r\nLabor force: NA\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 0%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues : $138 million\r\nexpenditures: $177 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n(1993)\r\n\r\nIndustries: tourism (particularly skiing), sheep, timber, tobacco,\r\nbanking\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 35,000 kW (1992)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 140 million kWh (1992)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: NA kWh; note - Andorra exports\r\nmost of its electricity to France and Spain\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: small quantities of tobacco, rye, wheat,\r\nbarley, oats, vegetables; sheep raising\r\n\r\nExports:\r\ntotal value : $47 million (f.o.b., 1995)\r\ncommodities: electricity, tobacco products, furniture\r\npartners : France 49%, Spain 47%\r\n\r\nImports:\r\ntotal value: $1 billion (1995)\r\ncommodities: consumer goods, food\r\npartners: France, Spain, US 4.2%\r\n\r\nDebt - external: $NA\r\n\r\nEconomic aid: none\r\n\r\nCurrency: 1 French franc (F) = 100 centimes; 1 peseta (Pta) = 100\r\ncentimos; the French and Spanish currencies are used\r\n\r\nExchange rates: French francs (F) per US$1 - 5.4169 (January 1997),\r\n5.1155 (1996), 4.9915 (1995), 5.5520 (1994), 5.6632 (1993), 5.2938\r\n(1992); Spanish pesetas (Ptas) per US$1 - 134.77 (January 1997),\r\n126.66 (1996), 124.69 (1995), 133.96 (1994), 127.26 (1993), 102.38\r\n(1992)\r\n\r\nFiscal year: calendar year\r\n\r\n@Andorra:Communications\r\n\r\nTelephones: 21,258 (1983 est.)\r\n\r\nTelephone system:\r\ndomestic : modern system with microwave radio relay connections\r\nbetween exchanges\r\ninternational: landline circuits to France and Spain\r\n\r\nRadio broadcast stations: AM 1, FM 0, shortwave 0\r\n\r\nRadios: 10,000 (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nTelevision broadcast stations: 0\r\n\r\nTelevisions: 7,000 (1991 est.)\r\n\r\n@Andorra:Transportation\r\n\r\nRailways: 0 km\r\n\r\nHighways:\r\ntotal: 269 km\r\npaved: 198 km\r\nunpaved : 71 km (1991 est.)\r\n\r\nPorts and harbors: none\r\n\r\nAirports: none\r\n\r\nMilitary\r\n\r\nMilitary - note: defense is the responsibility of France and Spain\r\n\r\nTransnational Issues\r\n\r\nDisputes - international: none\r\n______________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nANGOLA\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\nCurrent issues: Civil war has been the norm since independence from\r\nPortugal on 11 November 1975. A cease-fire lasted from 31 May 1991\r\nuntil October 1992 when the insurgent National Union for the Total\r\nIndependence of Angola (UNITA) refused to accept its defeat in\r\ninternationally monitored elections and fighting resumed throughout\r\nmuch of the countryside. The two sides signed another peace accord on\r\n20 November 1994 and the cease-fire is generally holding, but military\r\ntensions persist and banditry is increasing. In order to bring armed\r\ninsurgents under government control the peace accord of 20 November\r\n1994 provided for the integration of former UNITA insurgents into the\r\nAngolan armed forces. Military integration began in June 1996 and a\r\nGovernment of National Unity and Reconciliation was installed in April\r\n1997. Efforts which began in May 1997 to extend government into\r\nUNITA-occupied areas are proceeding slowly. The original 7,200-man UN\r\npeacekeeping force began a phased drawdown in late 1996. All UN\r\npeacekeepers are scheduled to depart by September 1997 but a small UN\r\nmilitary observer force will probably remain in Angola through 1998.\r\n\r\n@Angola:Geography\r\n\r\nLocation: Southern Africa, bordering the South Atlantic Ocean, between\r\nNamibia and Democratic Republic of the Congo\r\n\r\nGeographic coordinates: 12 30 S, 18 30 E\r\n\r\nMap references: Africa\r\n\r\nArea:\r\ntotal: 1,246,700 sq km\r\nland : 1,246,700 sq km\r\nwater: 0 sq km\r\n\r\nArea - comparative: slightly less than twice the size of Texas\r\n\r\nLand boundaries:\r\ntotal: 5,198 km\r\nborder countries: Democratic Republic of the Congo 2,511 km of which\r\n220 km is the boundary of discontiguous Cabinda province, Republic of\r\nthe Congo 201 km, Namibia 1,376 km, Zambia 1,110 km\r\n\r\nCoastline: 1,600 km\r\n\r\nMaritime claims:\r\nexclusive fishing zone: 200 nm\r\nterritorial sea: 20 nm\r\n\r\nClimate: semiarid in south and along coast to Luanda;

Despite its\r\nabundant natural resources, output per capita is among the world's\r\nlowest. Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for\r\n80%-90% of the population but accounts for about 12% of GDP. Oil\r\nproduction and the supporting activities are vital to the economy,\r\ncontributing about 50% to GDP. Notwithstanding the signing of a peace\r\naccord in November 1994, sporadic violence continues, millions of land\r\nmines remain, and many farmers are reluctant to return to their\r\nfields. As a result, much of the country's food must still be\r\nimported. To take advantage of its rich resources - notably gold,\r\ndiamonds, extensive forests, Atlantic fisheries, arable land, and\r\nlarge oil deposits - Angola will need to observe the cease-fire,\r\nimplement the peace agreement, and reform government policies. Despite\r\nthe high inflation and political difficulties, total output grew an\r\nestimated 9% in 1996, largely due to increased oil production.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $8.3 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 9% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $800 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 12%\r\nindustry: 56%\r\nservices: 32% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 1,700% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 2.783 million economically active\r\nby occupation: agriculture 85%, industry 15% (1985 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: extensive unemployment and underemployment\r\naffecting more than half the population (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $928 million\r\nexpenditures: $2.5 billion, including capital expenditures of $963\r\nmillion (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: petroleum;

Output growth had\r\naveraged about 7% in recent years, mainly as a result of a boom in\r\ntourism thanks to economic expansion in North America and the UK. The\r\neconomy, and especially the tourism sector, suffered a setback in late\r\n1995 due to the effects of Hurricane Luis in September. Agricultural\r\noutput had only just begun to recover from a drought in 1994 when Luis\r\nhit. Anguillan officials have put substantial effort into developing\r\nthe offshore financing sector. A comprehensive package of financial\r\nservices legislation was enacted in late 1994.

The dual island nation's\r\nagricultural production is mainly directed to the domestic market; the\r\nsector is constrained by the limited water supply and labor shortages\r\nthat reflect the pull of higher wages in tourism and construction.\r\nManufacturing comprises enclave-type assembly for export with major\r\nproducts being bedding, handicrafts, and electronic components.\r\nProspects for economic growth in the medium term will continue to\r\ndepend on income growth in the industrialized world, especially in the\r\nUS, which accounts for about half of all tourist arrivals.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $446 million (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 4.7% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $6,800 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture : 3.5%\r\nindustry: 19.3%\r\nservices: 77.2% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 4% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 30,000\r\nby occupation : commerce and services 82%, agriculture 11%, industry\r\n7% (1983)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 5%-10%(1995 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues : $134 million\r\nexpenditures: $135.4 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n(1995)\r\n\r\nIndustries: tourism, construction, light manufacturing (clothing,\r\nalcohol, household appliances)\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 54,000 kW (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: NA kWh\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: NA kWh\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: cotton, fruits, vegetables, bananas, coconuts,\r\ncucumbers, mangoes, sugarcane;

Nevertheless, following decades of\r\nmismanagement and statist policies, the economy in the late 1980s was\r\nplagued with huge external debts and recurring bouts of\r\nhyperinflation. Elected in 1989, in the depths of recession, President\r\nMENEM has implemented a comprehensive economic restructuring program\r\nthat shows signs of putting Argentina on a path of stable, sustainable\r\ngrowth. Argentina's currency has traded at par with the US dollar\r\nsince April 1991, and inflation has fallen to its lowest level in 50\r\nyears. Argentines have responded to price stability by repatriating\r\ncapital and investing in domestic industry. Growth averaged more than\r\n8% between 1991 and 1994, then fell to 4.6% in 1995, largely in\r\nreaction to the Mexican peso crisis. The economy grew at 4.4% in 1996,\r\nwith the strongest growth occurring in the second half of the year.\r\nUnemployment increased slightly - to over 17% - and Buenos Aires was\r\nforced to renegotiate fiscal targets with the IMF.

Although a cease-fire has been in effect since May 1994, the\r\nsides have not made substantial progress toward a peaceful resolution.\r\nPresident TER-PETROSSIAN's latitude on the issue may be further\r\nconstrained by his controversial reelection in September 1996. When\r\nsupporters of the main opposition candidate stormed the parliament\r\nfollowing the announcement of TER-PETROSSIAN's victory, MVD forces\r\nwere called in to restore order. The subsequent political standoff\r\nbetween government and opposition supporters diminished in late 1996\r\nas the government has gradually attempted reconciliation. Despite\r\nthese political problems, the Armenian government has been pursuing\r\nits aggressive economic reform program, although implementation of its\r\nprivatization program stalled in late 1996.\r\n\r\n@Armenia:Geography\r\n\r\nLocation: Southwestern Asia, east of Turkey\r\n\r\nGeographic coordinates: 40 00 N, 45 00 E\r\n\r\nMap references: Commonwealth of Independent States\r\n\r\nArea:\r\ntotal : 29,800 sq km\r\nland: 28,400 sq km\r\nwater: 1,400 sq km\r\n\r\nArea - comparative: slightly smaller than Maryland\r\n\r\nLand boundaries:\r\ntotal: 1,254 km\r\nborder countries: Azerbaijan-proper 566 km, Azerbaijan-Naxcivan\r\nexclave 221 km, Georgia 164 km, Iran 35 km, Turkey 268 km\r\n\r\nCoastline: 0 km (landlocked)\r\n\r\nMaritime claims: none (landlocked)\r\n\r\nClimate: highland continental, hot summers, cold winters\r\n\r\nTerrain: high Armenian Plateau with mountains;

Since the\r\nimplosion of the USSR in December 1991, Armenia has switched to\r\nsmall-scale agriculture away from the large agroindustrial complexes\r\nof the Soviet area. The privatization of industry has been at a much\r\nslower pace. Armenia is a food importer and its mineral deposits\r\n(gold, bauxite) are small. The ongoing conflict with Azerbaijan over\r\nthe ethnic Armenian-dominated region of Nagorno-Karabakh and the\r\nembargoes imposed by Azerbaijan and Turkey contributed to a severe\r\neconomic decline in the early 1990s. By 1994, however, the Armenian\r\nGovernment had launched an ambitious IMF-sponsored economic program\r\nthat has resulted in positive growth rates in 1995 and 1996. Armenia\r\nalso managed to slash inflation and to privatize most small and\r\nmedium-sized enterprises. The chronic energy shortages Armenia\r\nsuffered in recent years has been partially offset by the energy\r\nsupplied by one of its nuclear power plants at Metsamor, which in 1996\r\nsupplied about 40% of the country's energy needs, according to the\r\nArmenian Government. Moreover, Armenia is expanding its energy imports\r\nfrom Iran.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $9.7 billion (1996 estimate as\r\nextrapolated from World Bank estimate for 1994)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 4% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $2,800 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 35%\r\nindustry: 35%\r\nservices : 30% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 5.7% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal : 1.6 million (1996)\r\nby occupation: industry and construction 23%, agriculture 38%,\r\nservices 37%, other 2%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 7.4% officially registered unemployed, but large\r\nnumbers of underemployed (December 1996)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues : $NA\r\nexpenditures: $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n\r\nIndustries: much of industry is shut down;

Rich in natural resources,\r\nAustralia is a major exporter of agricultural products, minerals,\r\nmetals, and fossil fuels. Commodities account for about 60% of the\r\nvalue of total exports, so that a downturn in world commodity prices\r\ncan have a big impact on the economy. The government is pushing for\r\nincreased exports of manufactured goods, but competition in\r\ninternational markets continues to be severe. Australia has suffered\r\nfrom the low growth and high unemployment characterizing the OECD\r\ncountries in the early 1990s, but the economy has expanded at\r\nreasonably steady rates in recent years. In addition to high\r\nunemployment, short-term economic problems include a balancing of\r\noutput growth and inflationary pressures and the stimulation of\r\nexports to offset rising imports.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $430.5 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 3.6% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $23,600 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 3.1%\r\nindustry: 27.7%\r\nservices: 69.2% (1994)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 3.1% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 8.4 million (December 1996)\r\nby occupation : finance and services 34%, public and community\r\nservices 23%, wholesale and retail trade 20%, manufacturing and\r\nindustry 17%, agriculture 6% (1987 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 8.5% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $95.69 billion\r\nexpenditures : $95.15 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n(FY95/96 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: mining, industrial and transportation equipment, food\r\nprocessing, chemicals, steel\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 1.2% (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 38.83 million kW (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 173 billion kWh (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 8,278 kWh (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: wheat, barley, sugarcane, fruits;

Austria's\r\neconomy is closely integrated with Germany and other EU members -\r\nAustria joined the EU on 1 January 1995. Since the early 1980s, the\r\nAustrian economy has experienced stable growth. EU membership has had\r\na positive impact on foreign investment and has helped to lower\r\ninflation. In April 1996, the government passed a two-year austerity\r\nbudget - including cuts in social allowances, a freeze on civil\r\nservants' wages, and new energy and capital gains taxes - designed to\r\nbring the economy in line with the Maastricht criteria for membership\r\nin the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). EMU convergence has\r\nbecome a top priority for Austria. Despite Austria's generally\r\nfavorable prospects, the economy faces a number of medium-term\r\nchallenges; for example, fiscal tightening is constraining expected\r\ngrowth, and unemployment is expected to increase.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $157.6 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 1.1% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $19,700 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 3%\r\nindustry: 27%\r\nservices : 70% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 1.8% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 3.648 million (1996)\r\nby occupation: services 56.4%, industry and crafts 35.4%, agriculture\r\nand forestry 8.1%\r\nnote : an estimated 200,000 Austrians are employed in other European\r\ncountries; foreign laborers in Austria number 177,840, about 5% of\r\nlabor force (1988)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 6.2% (December 1996)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $61.2 billion\r\nexpenditures: $71 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n\r\nIndustries: food, iron and steel, machines, textiles, chemicals,\r\nelectrical, paper and pulp, tourism, mining, motor vehicles\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 0.6% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 17.43 million kW (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 56.5 billion kWh (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 5,960 kWh (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: grains, fruit, potatoes, sugar beets; cattle,\r\npigs, poultry; sawn wood\r\n\r\nExports:\r\ntotal value: $55.5 billion (1996 est.)\r\ncommodities: machinery and equipment, iron and steel, lumber,\r\ntextiles, paper products, chemicals\r\npartners: EU 64.8% (Germany 38.1%, Italy 8.1%), Eastern Europe 11.8%,\r\nJapan 1.6%, US 3.5% (1994)\r\n\r\nImports:\r\ntotal value : $65.8 billion (1996 est.)\r\ncommodities: petroleum, foodstuffs, machinery and equipment, vehicles,\r\nchemicals, textiles and clothing, pharmaceuticals\r\npartners: EU 68.4% (Germany 40%, Italy 8.8%), Eastern Europe 6.55%,\r\nJapan 4.3%, US 4.4% (1994)\r\n\r\nDebt - external: $30.2 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nEconomic aid:\r\ndonor: ODA, $544 million (1993)\r\n\r\nCurrency: 1 Austrian schilling (AS) = 100 groschen\r\n\r\nExchange rates: Austrian schillings (AS) per US$1 - 11.302 (January\r\n1997), 10.587 (1996), 10.081 (1995), 11.422 (1994), 11.632 (1993),\r\n10.989 (1992)\r\n\r\nFiscal year: calendar year\r\n\r\n@Austria:Communications\r\n\r\nTelephones: 3.47 million (1986 est.)\r\n\r\nTelephone system:\r\ndomestic: highly developed and efficient\r\ninternational : satellite earth stations - 2 Intelsat (1 Atlantic\r\nOcean and 1 Indian Ocean) and 2 Eutelsat\r\n\r\nRadio broadcast stations: AM 6, FM 21 (repeaters 545), shortwave 0\r\n\r\nRadios: NA\r\n\r\nTelevision broadcast stations: 47 (repeaters 870)\r\n\r\nTelevisions: 2,418,584 (1984 est.)\r\n\r\n@Austria:Transportation\r\n\r\nRailways:\r\ntotal : 5,624 km\r\nstandard gauge: 5,269 km 1.435-m gauge (3,263 km electrified)\r\nnarrow gauge: 355 km 1.000-m and 0.760-m gauge (86 km electrified)\r\n(1995)\r\n\r\nHighways: 200,000 km\r\npaved: 200,000 km (including 1,596 km of expressways)\r\nunpaved: 0 km (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nWaterways: 446 km\r\n\r\nPipelines: crude oil 554 km; petroleum products 171 km; natural gas\r\n2,611 km\r\n\r\nPorts and harbors: Linz, Vienna\r\n\r\nMerchant marine:\r\ntotal: 28 ships (1,000 GRT or over) totaling 84,623 GRT/116,682 DWT\r\nships by type: bulk 1, cargo 22, combination bulk 2, container 1,\r\nrefrigerated cargo 2 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nAirports: 55 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nAirports - with paved runways:\r\ntotal: 51\r\nover 3,047 m: 1\r\n2,438 to 3,047 m : 5\r\n1,524 to 2,437 m: 1\r\n914 to 1,523 m: 3\r\nunder 914 m: 41 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nAirports - with unpaved runways:\r\ntotal: 4\r\n914 to 1,523 m : 4 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nHeliports: 1 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nMilitary\r\n\r\nMilitary branches: Army (includes Flying Division)\r\n\r\nMilitary manpower - military age: 19 years of age\r\n\r\nMilitary manpower - availability:\r\nmales age 15-49: 2,107,905 (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nMilitary manpower - fit for military service:\r\nmales: 1,754,823 (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nMilitary manpower - reaching military age annually:\r\nmales: 46,298 (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nMilitary expenditures - dollar figure: $2.1 billion (1995)\r\n\r\nMilitary expenditures - percent of GDP: 1% (1995)\r\n\r\nTransnational Issues\r\n\r\nDisputes - international: none\r\n\r\nIllicit drugs: transshipment point for Southwest Asian heroin and\r\nSouth American cocaine destined for Western Europe\r\n______________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nAZERBAIJAN\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\nCurrent issues: Azerbaijan continues to be plagued by an unresolved\r\nnine-year-old conflict with Armenian separatists over its\r\nNagorno-Karabakh region. The Karabakh Armenians have declared\r\nindependence and seized almost 20% of the country's territory,\r\ncreating almost 1 million Azerbaijani refugees in the process. Both\r\nsides have generally observed a Russian-mediated cease-fire in place\r\nsince May 1994, and support the OSCE-mediated peace process, now\r\nentering its fifth year. Nevertheless, Baku and Xankandi (Stepanakert,\r\nNagorno-Karabakh region) remain far apart on most substantive issues\r\nfrom the placement and composition of a peacekeeping force to the\r\nenclave's ultimate political status, and prospects for a negotiated\r\nsettlement remain dim.\r\n\r\n@Azerbaijan:Geography\r\n\r\nLocation: Southwestern Asia, bordering the Caspian Sea, between Iran\r\nand Russia\r\n\r\nGeographic coordinates: 40 30 N, 47 30 E\r\n\r\nMap references: Commonwealth of Independent States\r\n\r\nArea:\r\ntotal: 86,600 sq km\r\nland: 86,100 sq km\r\nwater: 500 sq km\r\nnote: includes the exclave of Naxcivan Autonomous Republic and the\r\nNagorno-Karabakh region;

It\r\nresembles the Central Asian states in its majority nominally Muslim\r\npopulation, high structural unemployment, and low standard of living.\r\nThe economy's most prominent products are oil, cotton, and gas.\r\nProduction from the Caspian oil and gas field has been in decline for\r\nseveral years, but the November 1994 ratification of the $7.5 billion\r\noil deal with a consortium of Western companies should generate the\r\nfunds needed to spur future industrial development. Azerbaijan shares\r\nall the formidable problems of the ex-Soviet republics in making the\r\ntransition from a command to a market economy, but its considerable\r\nenergy resources brighten its long-term prospects. Baku has only\r\nrecently begun making progress on economic reform, and old economic\r\nties and structures are slowly being replaced. A major short-term\r\nobstacle to economic progress, including stepped up foreign\r\ninvestment, is the continuing conflict with Armenia over the ethnic\r\nArmenian-dominated region of Nagorno-Karabakh. Trade with Russia and\r\nthe other former Soviet republics is declining in importance while\r\ntrade is building up with the nations of Europe, Turkey, Iran and the\r\nUAE.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $11.9 billion (1996 estimate as\r\nextrapolated from World Bank estimate for 1994)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 1.2% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $1,550 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 26%\r\nindustry : 30%\r\nservices: 44% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 20% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 2.789 million\r\nby occupation: agriculture and forestry 32%, industry and construction\r\n26%, other 42% (1990)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 1.1% includes officially registered unemployed;\r\nalso large numbers of unregistered unemployed and underemployed\r\nworkers (December 1996)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $565 million\r\nexpenditures: $682 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n(1996 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: petroleum and natural gas, petroleum products, oilfield\r\nequipment;

Tourism\r\nalone accounts for more than 50% of GDP and directly or indirectly\r\nemploys 40% of the archipelago's labor force. A slowdown in the\r\nexpansion of the tourism sector - especially stopover travel from\r\nEurope - led to a reduction in the country's GDP growth rate in 1995,\r\ndown to an estimated 2% from 3.5% in 1994. The construction sector\r\nbenefited from hotel rehabilitation and the government's ongoing\r\nhousing development program. Earnings from exports of vegetable and\r\ncitrus production have been decreasing since 1993 but were expected to\r\nincrease in 1996 due to storm damage to crops in Florida. Overall\r\ngrowth prospects in the short run will depend heavily on the fortunes\r\nof the tourism sector and continued income growth in the US, which\r\naccounts for the majority of tourist visits.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $4.8 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 2% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $18,700 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture : 3%\r\nindustry: 6%\r\nservices: 91% (1994)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 2.1% (1995)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 136,900 (1993)\r\nby occupation : government 30%, tourism 40%, business services 10%,\r\nagriculture 5% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 15% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $665 million\r\nexpenditures: $725 million, including capital expenditures of $94\r\nmillion (FY95/96 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: tourism, banking, cement, oil refining and transshipment,\r\nsalt production, rum, aragonite, pharmaceuticals, spiral-welded steel\r\npipe\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 267,000 kW (1993)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 874 million kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 2,717 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: citrus, vegetables;

Annual GDP growth has averaged over 4% in recent\r\nyears from a low base. Its economy is largely agricultural, with the\r\ncultivation of rice the single most important activity in the economy.\r\nMajor impediments to growth include frequent cyclones and floods, the\r\ninefficiency of state-owned enterprises, a rapidly growing labor force\r\nthat cannot be absorbed by agriculture, delays in exploiting energy\r\nresources (natural gas), inadequate power supplies, and slow\r\nimplementation of economic reforms. Frequent strikes that crippled the\r\neconomy in 1995 and early 1996 subsided after Prime Minister Sheikh\r\nHasina WAJED's Awami League government assumed power in mid-1996,\r\nallowing a return to normal economic activity. The current government\r\nhas made some headway improving the climate for foreign investors and\r\nliberalizing the capital markets; for example, it has negotiated with\r\nforeign firms for oil and gas exploration, better countrywide\r\ndistribution of cooking gas, and the construction of natural gas\r\npipelines and power plants.

The start of the Port Charles Marina project in Speightstown\r\nhelped the tourism industry continue to expand in 1996. The industry\r\ngenerated $331.8 million by the end of June and was expected to double\r\nby the end of the year. Prime Minister Owen ARTHUR called for\r\n\"prudent\" financial management to ensure that economic growth would\r\ncontinue. As part of his plan, the Prime Minister introduced a\r\ncontroversial Value Added Tax (VAT) in an effort to reform the tax\r\nadministration process. The VAT will be administered at 15% for most\r\nindustries and 7% for the tourism industry. The government has also\r\ncontinued its efforts to promote regional integration initiatives, to\r\nreduce the unacceptably high unemployment rate, and to encourage\r\ndirect foreign investment.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $2.65 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 3.5% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $10,300 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 6.4%\r\nindustry: 39.3%\r\nservices: 54.3% (1994)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 1.8% (1995)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 126,000 (1993)\r\nby occupation: services and government 41%, commerce 15%,\r\nmanufacturing and construction 18%, transportation, storage,\r\ncommunications, and financial institutions 8%, agriculture 6%,\r\nutilities 2% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 16.2% (1996)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $550 million\r\nexpenditures: $710 million, including capital expenditures of $86\r\nmillion (FY95/96 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: tourism, sugar, light manufacturing, component assembly\r\nfor export\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 7.7% (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 153,000 kW (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 644 million kWh (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 2,208 kWh (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: sugarcane, vegetables, cotton\r\n\r\nExports:\r\ntotal value: $235 million (f.o.b., 1995)\r\ncommodities: sugar and molasses, rum, other foods and beverages,\r\nchemicals, electrical components, clothing\r\npartners: US 13%, UK 10%, Trinidad and Tobago 9%, Windward Islands 8%\r\n\r\nImports:\r\ntotal value: $763 million (c.i.f., 1995)\r\ncommodities: consumer goods, machinery, foodstuffs, construction\r\nmaterials, chemicals, fuel, electrical components\r\npartners: US 36%, UK 11%, Trinidad and Tobago 11%, Japan 3%\r\n\r\nDebt - external: $359 million (December 1996)\r\n\r\nEconomic aid: $NA\r\n\r\nCurrency: 1 Barbadian dollar (Bds$) = 100 cents\r\n\r\nExchange rates: Barbadian dollars (Bds$) per US$1 - 2.0113 (fixed\r\nrate)\r\n\r\nFiscal year: 1 April - 31 March\r\n\r\n@Barbados:Communications\r\n\r\nTelephones: 87,343 (1991 est.)\r\n\r\nTelephone system:\r\ndomestic: island wide automatic telephone system\r\ninternational: satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean);\r\ntropospheric scatter to Trinidad and Saint Lucia\r\n\r\nRadio broadcast stations: AM 3, FM 2, shortwave 0\r\n\r\nRadios: NA\r\n\r\nTelevision broadcast stations: 2 (1 pay)\r\n\r\nTelevisions: 69,350 (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n@Barbados:Transportation\r\n\r\nRailways: 0 km\r\n\r\nHighways:\r\ntotal: 1,610 km\r\npaved : 1,542 km\r\nunpaved: 68 km (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nPorts and harbors: Bridgetown\r\n\r\nMerchant marine:\r\ntotal: 51 ships (1,000 GRT or over) totaling 453,828 GRT/684,470 DWT\r\nships by type : bulk 16, cargo 27, combination bulk 4, oil tanker 3,\r\nrefrigerated cargo 1 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nAirports: 1 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nAirports - with paved runways:\r\ntotal: 1\r\nover 3,047 m: 1 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nMilitary\r\n\r\nMilitary branches: Royal Barbados Defense Force (includes Ground\r\nForces and Coast Guard), Royal Barbados Police Force\r\n\r\nMilitary manpower - availability:\r\nmales age 15-49: 71,547 (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nMilitary manpower - fit for military service:\r\nmales: 49,446 (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nMilitary expenditures - dollar figure: $NA\r\n\r\nMilitary expenditures - percent of GDP: NA%\r\n\r\nTransnational Issues\r\n\r\nDisputes - international: none\r\n\r\nIllicit drugs: one of many Caribbean transshipment points for\r\nnarcotics bound for the US and Europe\r\n______________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nBASSAS DA INDIA\r\n\r\n(possession of France)\r\n\r\n@Bassas da India:Geography\r\n\r\nLocation: Southern Africa, islands in the southern Mozambique Channel,\r\nabout one-half of the way from Madagascar to Mozambique\r\n\r\nGeographic coordinates: 21 30 S, 39 50 E\r\n\r\nMap references: Africa\r\n\r\nArea:\r\ntotal: 0.2 sq km\r\nland: 0.2 sq km\r\nwater: 0 sq km\r\n\r\nArea - comparative: about one-third the size of The Mall in\r\nWashington, DC\r\n\r\nLand boundaries: 0 km\r\n\r\nCoastline: 35.2 km\r\n\r\nMaritime claims:\r\nexclusive economic zone: 200 nm\r\nterritorial sea: 12 nm\r\n\r\nClimate: tropical\r\n\r\nTerrain: a volcanic rock 2.4 meters high\r\n\r\nElevation extremes:\r\nlowest point: Indian Ocean 0 m\r\nhighest point: unnamed location 3 m\r\n\r\nNatural resources: none\r\n\r\nLand use:\r\narable land : 0%\r\npermanent crops: 0%\r\npermanent pastures: 0%\r\nforests and woodland: 0%\r\nother: 100% (all rock)\r\n\r\nIrrigated land: 0 sq km (1993)\r\n\r\nNatural hazards: maritime hazard since it is usually under water\r\nduring high tide and surrounded by reefs;

However, the breakup of the Soviet Union and its\r\ntraditional trade ties in December 1991, as well as the government's\r\nfailure to embrace market reforms, has resulted in a sharp economic\r\ndecline. Privatization is virtually nonexistent and the system of\r\nstate orders and distribution persists. Although President LUKASHENKO\r\npronounces his 1995 macro stabilization policies a success - annual\r\ninflation dropped from 2,220% in 1994 to 244% in 1995 - the IMF has\r\ncriticized his exchange rate policies and suspended Minsk's $300\r\nmillion standby program in November 1995. The overvalued ruble has\r\nespecially hurt Belarusian exporters, most of which now operate at a\r\nloss. In addition, the January 1995 Customs Union agreement with\r\nRussia - which required Minsk to adjust its foreign trade practices to\r\nmirror Moscow's - has resulted in higher import tariffs for Belarusian\r\nconsumers; tariffs rose from 5%-20% to 20%-40%. In general, as of the\r\nbeginning of 1997, Belarus has badly lagged in moving away from the\r\nold centrally planned policies of the former USSR.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $51.9 billion (1996 estimate as\r\nextrapolated from World Bank estimate for 1994)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 3% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $5,000 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 21%\r\nindustry: 49%\r\nservices: 30% (1991 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 33% (1996)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 4.731 million\r\nby occupation: industry and construction 36%, agriculture and forestry\r\n19%, services 45% (1995)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 3.1% officially registered unemployed (December\r\n1996); large numbers of underemployed workers\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues : $NA\r\nexpenditures: $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n\r\nIndustries: tractors, metal-cutting machine tools, off-highway dump\r\ntrucks up to 110-metric-ton load capacity, wheel-type earth movers for\r\nconstruction and mining, eight-wheel-drive, high-flotation trucks with\r\ncargo capacity of 25 metric tons for use in tundra and roadless areas,\r\nequipment for animal husbandry and livestock feeding, motorcycles,\r\ntelevision sets, chemical fibers, fertilizer, linen fabric, wool\r\nfabric, radios, refrigerators, other consumer goods\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 3.2% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 7.21 million kW (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 23.7 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 2,553 kWh (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: grain, potatoes, vegetables; meat, milk\r\n\r\nExports:\r\ntotal value: $5.2 billion (f.o.b., 1996)\r\ncommodities: machinery and transport equipment, chemicals, foodstuffs\r\npartners: Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Germany\r\n\r\nImports:\r\ntotal value: $6.8 billion (c.i.f., 1996)\r\ncommodities: fuel, natural gas, industrial raw materials, textiles,\r\nsugar\r\npartners: Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Germany\r\n\r\nDebt - external: $2 billion (September 1995 est.)\r\n\r\nEconomic aid:\r\nrecipient: ODA, $186 million (1993)\r\nnote : commitments, $3,930 million ($1,845 million disbursements),\r\n1992-95\r\n\r\nCurrency: Belarusian ruble (BR)\r\n\r\nExchange rates: Belarusian rubles per US$1 - 16,613 (September monthly\r\naverage 1996),15,500 (yearend 1996), 11,500 (yearend 1995), 10,600\r\n(yearend 1994), 699 (yearend 1993), 15 (yearend 1992)\r\n\r\nFiscal year: calendar year\r\n\r\n@Belarus:Communications\r\n\r\nTelephones: 1.849 million (1991 est.)\r\n\r\nTelephone system: telephone service inadequate for the purposes of\r\neither business or the population; about 70% of the telephones are in\r\nhomes; over 750,000 applications from households for telephones remain\r\nunsatisfied (1992 est.); new investment centers on international\r\nconnections and business needs\r\ndomestic : the new NMT-450 analog cellular system is now operating in\r\nMinsk\r\ninternational: international traffic is carried by the Moscow\r\ninternational gateway switch and also by satellite; satellite earth\r\nstations - 1 Intelsat (through Canada) and 1 Eutelsat (through the UK)\r\n\r\nRadio broadcast stations: AM 35, FM 18, shortwave 0\r\n\r\nRadios: 3.17 million (1991 est.)

Growth in real output, which had averaged a sound 4% in\r\n1990-95, rose to 5.5% in 1996. Rapid population growth offset much of\r\nthis growth in output. Inflation jumped to 55% in 1994 (compared to 3%\r\nin 1993) following the 50% currency devaluation in January 1994, but\r\nhas subsided gradually over the past two years, with 14.5% inflation\r\nin 1995 and a target of 4.5% inflation in 1996. Commercial and\r\ntransport activities, which make up a large part of GDP, are extremely\r\nvulnerable to developments in Nigeria as evidenced by decreased\r\nreexport trade in 1994 due to a severe contraction in Nigerian demand.\r\nSupport by the Paris Club and official bilateral creditors has eased\r\nthe external debt situation in recent years.

The tourist industry\r\nattracts 91% of its business from North America. The industrial sector\r\nis small, and agriculture is severely limited by a lack of suitable\r\nland. About 80% of food needs are imported. International business\r\ncontributes over 60% of Bermuda's economic output; a failed\r\nindependence vote in late 1995 can be partially attributed to\r\nBermudian's fear of scaring away foreign firms.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $1.8 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 2.4% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $29,000 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: NA%\r\nindustry: NA%\r\nservices: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 2.5% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 34,133\r\nby occupation: clerical 23%, services 23%, laborers 17%, professional\r\nand technical 16%, administrative and managerial 12%, sales 7%,\r\nagriculture and fishing 2% (1995)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NEGL% (1995)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $406.2 million\r\nexpenditures : $405.9 million, including capital expenditures of $34.5\r\nmillion (FY94/95 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: tourism, finance, insurance, structural concrete products,\r\npaints, perfumes, pharmaceuticals, ship repairing\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 145,000 kW (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 527,526,728 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 7,856 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: bananas, vegetables, citrus, flowers;

Agriculture consists largely of subsistence farming and animal\r\nhusbandry. Rugged mountains dominate the terrain and make the building\r\nof roads and other infrastructure difficult and expensive. The economy\r\nis closely aligned with India's through strong trade and monetary\r\nlinks. The industrial sector is small and technologically backward,\r\nwith most production of the cottage industry type. Most development\r\nprojects, such as road construction, rely on Indian migrant labor.\r\nBhutan's hydropower potential and its attraction for tourists are key\r\nresources; however, the government limits the number of tourists to\r\n4,000 per year to minimize foreign influence. The Bhutanese Government\r\nhas made some progress in expanding the nation's productive base and\r\nimproving social welfare, but growth continues to be constrained by\r\nthe government's desire to protect the country's environment and\r\ncultural traditions. Growth picked up in 1995 and the country's\r\nbalance of payments remained strong with comfortable reserves. The\r\ncautious fiscal stance planned for FY95/96 suggests continued economic\r\nstability in 1996. However, excessive controls and uncertain policies\r\nin areas like industrial licensing, trade, labor, and finance continue\r\nto hamper foreign investment.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $1.3 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 6.9% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $730 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 42%\r\nindustry: 31%\r\nservices : 27%\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 8.6% (FY94/95 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: NA\r\nby occupation : agriculture 93%, services 5%, industry and commerce 2%\r\nnote: massive lack of skilled labor\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $52 million\r\nexpenditures: $150 million, including capital expenditures of $95\r\nmillion (FY93/94 est.)\r\nnote: the government of India finances nearly three-fifths of Bhutan's\r\nbudget expenditures\r\n\r\nIndustries: cement, wood products, processed fruits, alcoholic\r\nbeverages, calcium carbide\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 7.6% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 351,000 kW (1989)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 1.67 billion kWh (1994)\r\nnote: exports electricity to India\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 79 kWh (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: rice, corn, root crops, citrus, foodgrains;\r\ndairy products, eggs\r\n\r\nExports:\r\ntotal value: $70.9 million (f.o.b., FY94/95 est.)\r\ncommodities: cardamom, gypsum, timber, handicrafts, cement, fruit,\r\nelectricity (to India), precious stones, spices\r\npartners: India 94%, Bangladesh\r\n\r\nImports:\r\ntotal value: $113.6 million (c.i.f., FY94/95 est.)\r\ncommodities : fuel and lubricants, grain, machinery and parts,\r\nvehicles, fabrics, rice\r\npartners: India 77%, Japan, UK, Germany, US\r\n\r\nDebt - external: $141 million (October 1994)\r\n\r\nEconomic aid:\r\nrecipient: $NA\r\n\r\nCurrency: 1 ngultrum (Nu) = 100 chetrum;

However, Bolivia has\r\nexperienced generally improving economic conditions since the PAZ\r\nEstenssoro administration (1985-89) introduced market-oriented\r\npolicies which reduced inflation from 11,700% in 1985 to about 20% in\r\n1988. PAZ Estenssoro was followed as president by Jaime PAZ Zamora\r\n(1989-93) who continued the free-market policies of his predecessor,\r\ndespite opposition from his own party and from Bolivia's once powerful\r\nlabor movement. By maintaining fiscal discipline, PAZ Zamora helped\r\nreduce inflation to 9.3% in 1993, while GDP grew by an annual average\r\nof 3.25% during his tenure. Inaugurated in August 1993, President\r\nSANCHEZ DE LOZADA has vowed to advance the market-oriented economic\r\nreforms he helped launch as PAZ Estenssoro's planning minister. His\r\nsuccesses include the signing of a free trade agreement with Mexico\r\nand the Southern Cone Common Market (Mercosur) as well as the\r\nprivatization of the state airline, phone company, railroad, electric\r\npower company, and oil company.

The Dayton Agreement, signed by Bosnian President\r\nIZETBEGOVIC, Croatian President TUDJMAN, and Serbian President\r\nMILOSEVIC, divides Bosnia and Herzegovina roughly equally between the\r\nMuslim/Croat Federation and the Bosnian Serbs while maintaining\r\nBosnia's currently recognized borders. In 1995-96, a NATO-led\r\ninternational peacekeeping force (IFOR) of 60,000 troops served in\r\nBosnia to implement and monitor the military aspects of the agreement.\r\nIFOR was succeeded by a smaller, NATO-led Stabilization Force (SFOR)\r\nwhose mission is to deter renewed hostilities. SFOR will remain in\r\nplace until June 1998. A High Representative appointed by the UN\r\nSecurity Council is responsible for civilian implementation of the\r\naccord, including monitoring implementation, facilitating any\r\ndifficulties arising in connection with civilian implementation, and\r\ncoordinating activities of the civilian organizations and agencies in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina. The Bosnian conflict began in the spring of\r\n1992 when the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina held a referendum\r\non independence and the Bosnian Serbs - supported by neighboring\r\nSerbia - responded with armed resistance aimed at partitioning the\r\nrepublic along ethnic lines and joining Serb-held areas to form a\r\n\"greater Serbia.\" In March 1994, Bosnia's Muslims and Croats reduced\r\nthe number of warring factions from three to two by signing an\r\nagreement in Washington creating their joint Muslim/Croat Federation\r\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Federation, formed by the Muslims and\r\nCroats in March 1994, is one of two entities (the other being the\r\nBosnian Serb-led Republika Srpska) that comprise Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina.\r\n\r\n@Bosnia and Herzegovina:Geography\r\n\r\nLocation: Southeastern Europe, bordering the Adriatic Sea and Croatia\r\n\r\nGeographic coordinates: 44 00 N, 18 00 E\r\n\r\nMap references: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Europe\r\n\r\nArea:\r\ntotal: 51,233 sq km\r\nland: 51,233 sq km\r\nwater: 0 sq km\r\n\r\nArea - comparative: slightly smaller than West Virginia\r\n\r\nLand boundaries:\r\ntotal: 1,459 km\r\nborder countries: Croatia 932 km, Serbia and Montenegro 527 km (312 km\r\nwith Serbia, 215 km with Montenegro)\r\n\r\nCoastline: 20 km\r\n\r\nMaritime claims: NA\r\n\r\nClimate: hot summers and cold winters;

Bosnia was partitioned by fighting during 1992-95 and\r\ngoverned by competing ethnic factions. Bosnia's current governing\r\nstructures were created by the Dayton Accords, the 1995 peace\r\nagreement which was officially signed in Paris on 14 December 1995 by\r\nBosnian President IZETBEGOVIC, Croatian President TUDJMAN, and Serbian\r\nPresident MILOSEVIC. This agreement retained Bosnia's exterior border\r\nand created a joint multi-ethnic and democratic government. This\r\nnational government - based on proportional representation similar to\r\nthat which existed in the former socialist regime - is charged with\r\nconducting foreign, economic, and fiscal policy. The Dayton Accords\r\nalso recognized a second tier of government, comprised of two entities\r\n- a joint Muslim-Croat Federation and the Bosnian Serb Republika\r\nSrpska (RS) - each presiding over roughly one-half the territory.\r\nThese Federation and RS governments are charged with overseeing\r\ninternal functions. As mandated by the Dayton Accords, the Bosnians on\r\n14 September 1996 participated in the first post-war elections of\r\nnational, entity, and cantonal leaders. The Bosnians have been slow to\r\nform and install new joint institutions. A new Federation cabinet was\r\nsworn in 18 December 1996 and the new Bosnian central government\r\ncabinet was confirmed on 3 January 1997.\r\n\r\nEconomy\r\n\r\nEconomy - overview: Bosnia and Herzegovina ranked next to The Former\r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia as the poorest republic in the old\r\nYugoslav federation. Although agriculture has been almost all in\r\nprivate hands, farms have been small and inefficient, and the republic\r\ntraditionally has been a net importer of food. Industry has been\r\ngreatly overstaffed, one reflection of the rigidities of communist\r\ncentral planning and management. TITO had pushed the development of\r\nmilitary industries in the republic with the result that Bosnia hosted\r\na large share of Yugoslavia's defense plants. The bitter interethnic\r\nwarfare in Bosnia caused production to plummet by perhaps 90% since\r\n1990, unemployment to soar, and human misery to multiply. No reliable\r\neconomic statistics for 1992-96 are available, although output almost\r\ncertainly is well below $1,000 per head. In the Federation,\r\nunemployment remains in the 40%-50% range and inflation is low. By\r\ncontrast, growth in the Republika Srpska in 1996 was flat and\r\ninflation surpassed 30%. The country receives substantial amounts of\r\nhumanitarian aid from the international community. Wide regional\r\ndifferences in war damage and access to the outside world have\r\nresulted in substantial variations in living conditions among local\r\nareas.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $1.9 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $600 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: NA%\r\nindustry: NA%\r\nservices: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: NA%\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 1,026,254\r\nby occupation: NA%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: officially about 70% but probably much lower,\r\nperhaps 40%-50% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $NA\r\nexpenditures: $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n\r\nIndustries: steel, coal, iron ore, lead, zinc, manganese, bauxite,\r\nvehicle assembly, textiles, tobacco products, wooden furniture, tank\r\nand aircraft assembly, domestic appliances, oil refining;

Prior to the institution of a stabilization\r\nplan - the Plano Real (Real Plan) - in mid-1994, stratospheric\r\ninflation rates had disrupted economic activity and discouraged\r\nforeign investment. Since then, tight monetary policy has brought\r\ninflation under control - consumer prices increased by only 10% in\r\n1996 compared to more than 1,000% in 1994. At the same time, GDP\r\ngrowth slowed from 5.7% in 1994 to 2.9% in 1996 due to tighter credit.\r\nThe steadily appreciating currency has also encouraged imports,\r\ncontributing to a growing trade deficit, and depressed export growth.\r\nBrazil's more stable economy allowed it to weather the fallout in 1995\r\nfrom the Mexican peso crisis relatively well, and record levels of\r\nforeign investment have since flowed in, helping to swell official\r\nforeign exchange reserves to $60 billion in 1996; stock markets\r\nreflected this increased investor confidence, gaining 53% in dollar\r\nterms. President CARDOSO remains committed to further reducing\r\ninflation in 1997 and putting Brazil on track for expanded economic\r\ngrowth, but he faces several key challenges. Fiscal reforms requiring\r\nconstitutional amendments are stalled in the Brazilian legislature; in\r\ntheir absence, the government is continuing to run deficits and has\r\nlimited room to relax its interest and exchange rate policies much if\r\nit wants to keep inflation under control. High interest rates have\r\nmade servicing domestic debt dramatically more burdensome for both\r\npublic and private sector entities, contributing to federal and state\r\nbudget problems and a surge in bankruptcies.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $1.022 trillion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 2.9% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $6,300 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 13%\r\nindustry: 38%\r\nservices: 49% (1995)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 10% (1996)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 57 million (1989 est.)\r\nby occupation: services 42%, agriculture 31%, industry 27%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 5.2% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $86 billion\r\nexpenditures: $90 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n(1995)\r\n\r\nIndustries: textiles, shoes, chemicals, cement, lumber, iron ore, tin,\r\nsteel, aircraft, motor vehicles and parts, other machinery and\r\nequipment\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 3.5% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 59.036 million kW (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 268.874 billion kWh (1995)\r\nnote: imports some electricity from Paraguay\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 1,572 kWh (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: coffee, soybeans, wheat, rice, corn,\r\nsugarcane, cocoa, citrus;

It is almost totally\r\nsupported by exports of crude oil and natural gas, with revenues from\r\nthe petroleum sector accounting for perhaps half of GDP. Per capita\r\nGDP is among the highest in the Third World, and substantial income\r\nfrom overseas investment supplements income from domestic production.\r\nThe government provides for all medical services and subsidizes food\r\nand housing.

Slow advancement on\r\neconomic reforms pitched the economy into crisis in 1996, marked by a\r\nbanking system in turmoil, a depreciating currency, inflation of 311%\r\nand contracting production and foreign trade. Foreign exchange\r\nreserves dwindled to extremely low levels ($518 million), while\r\ndramatically hiked interest rates added to the domestic debt burden\r\nand stifled growth. GDP fell by 10% in 1996, after experiencing 2.6%\r\ngrowth in 1995. Privatization of state-owned industries stagnated,\r\nalthough the first auction of a mass privatization program was\r\nundertaken in late 1996. Lagging progress on structural reforms led to\r\npostponement of IMF disbursements under a $580 million standby loan\r\nagreed to in July. In November 1996, the IMF proposed a currency board\r\nas Bulgaria's best chance to restore confidence in the lev, eliminate\r\ndiscretionary spending, and avoid hyperinflation. The government has\r\npledged to sell some of the country's most attractive state assets to\r\nthe highest foreign bidders in 1997. The Bulgarian economy is\r\nprojected to have another year of negative growth (minus 5%), and\r\ninflation near 700% in 1997, assuming introduction of a currency board\r\nin July of 1997.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $39.9 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: -10% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $4,630 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 12.6%\r\nindustry: 35.7%\r\nservices: 51.7% (1994)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 311% (1996)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 3.57 million (1996 est.)\r\nby occupation : industry 41%, agriculture 18%, other 41% (1992)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 12.5% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $3 billion\r\nexpenditures : $4.1 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n(1996 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: machine building and metal working, food processing,\r\nchemicals, textiles, construction materials, ferrous and nonferrous\r\nmetals\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: -6.5% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 12.09 million kW (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 36.07 billion kWh (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 4,491 kWh (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: grain, oilseed, vegetables, fruits, tobacco;\r\nlivestock\r\n\r\nExports:\r\ntotal value: $4.2 billion (f.o.b., 1996 est.)\r\ncommodities : machinery and equipment 12.8%;

Government policy in the last eight\r\nyears, 1989-96, has aimed at revitalizing the economy after three\r\ndecades of tight central planning. Thus, private activity has markedly\r\nincreased; foreign investment has been encouraged, so far with\r\nmoderate success; and efforts continue to increase the efficiency of\r\nstate enterprises. Published estimates of Burma's foreign trade are\r\ngreatly understated because of the volume of black-market trade. A\r\nmajor ongoing problem is the failure to achieve monetary and fiscal\r\nstability. Although Burma remains a poor Asian country, its rich\r\nresources furnish the potential for substantial long-term increases in\r\nincome, exports, and living standards.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $51.5 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 7% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $1,120 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 63%\r\nindustry: 9%\r\nservices : 28% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 30%-40% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 16.007 million (1992)\r\nby occupation: agriculture 65.2%, industry 14.3%, trade 10.1%,\r\ngovernment 6.3%, other 4.1% (FY88/89 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $5.3 billion\r\nexpenditures : $10 billion, including capital expenditures of $3\r\nbillion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: agricultural processing;

since October 1996,\r\nan estimated 92,000 Burundi Hutus who fled to Zaire have been forced\r\nto return to Burundi by Tutsi rebel forces in Zaire, leaving an\r\nestimated 35,000 still dispersed there; in Burundi, the ethnic\r\nviolence between the Hutus and the Tutsis continued in 1996, causing\r\nan estimated additional 150,000 Burundi Hutus to flee to Tanzania,\r\nthus raising their numbers in that country to about 250,000\r\n\r\n@Burundi:Geography\r\n\r\nLocation: Central Africa, east of Democratic Republic of the Congo\r\n\r\nGeographic coordinates: 3 30 S, 30 00 E\r\n\r\nMap references: Africa\r\n\r\nArea:\r\ntotal: 27,830 sq km\r\nland: 25,650 sq km\r\nwater: 2,180 sq km\r\n\r\nArea - comparative: slightly smaller than Maryland\r\n\r\nLand boundaries:\r\ntotal: 974 km\r\nborder countries: Democratic Republic of the Congo 233 km, Rwanda 290\r\nkm, Tanzania 451 km\r\n\r\nCoastline: 0 km (landlocked)\r\n\r\nMaritime claims: none (landlocked)\r\n\r\nClimate: equatorial;

The economy is predominately\r\nagricultural with roughly 90% of the population dependent on\r\nsubsistence agriculture. Its economic health depends on the coffee\r\ncrop, which accounts for 80% of foreign exchange earnings. The ability\r\nto pay for imports therefore rests largely on the vagaries of the\r\nclimate and the international coffee market. As part of its economic\r\nreform agenda, launched in February 1991 with IMF and World Bank\r\nsupport, Burundi is trying to diversify its agricultural exports,\r\nattract foreign investment in industry, and modernize government\r\nbudgetary practices. Since October 1993 the nation has suffered from\r\nmassive ethnic-based violence which has resulted in the death of\r\nperhaps 100,000 persons and the displacement of a million others.\r\nProduction continued to fall in 1996; foods, medicines, and\r\nelectricity are in extremely short supply.

Government leaders are moving\r\ntoward restoring fiscal and monetary discipline and have established\r\ngood working relations with international financial institutions.\r\nGrowth, starting from a low base, has been strong in 1991-96. Despite\r\nsuch positive developments, the reconstruction effort faces many tough\r\nchallenges because of the persistence of internal political divisions\r\nand the related lack of confidence of foreign investors. Rural\r\nCambodia, where 90% of about 9.5 million Khmer live, remains mired in\r\npoverty. The almost total lack of basic infrastructure in the\r\ncountryside will hinder development and will contribute to a growing\r\nimbalance in growth between urban and rural areas over the near term.\r\nMoreover, the government's lack of experience in administering\r\neconomic and technical assistance programs and rampant corruption\r\namong officials will slow the growth of critical public sector\r\ninvestment. The decline of inflation from the 1992 rate of more than\r\n50% is one of the bright spots.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $7.7 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 7.4% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $710 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture : 51%\r\nindustry: 14%\r\nservices: 35%\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 5% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 2.5 million to 3 million\r\nby occupation : agriculture 80% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $261 million\r\nexpenditures: $496 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n(1995 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: rice milling, fishing, wood and wood products, rubber,\r\ncement, gem mining, textiles\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 7.9% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 100,000 kW (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 180 million kWh (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 17 kWh (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: rice, rubber, corn, vegetables\r\n\r\nExports:\r\ntotal value: $464 million (1996 est.)\r\ncommodities: timber, rubber, soybeans, sesame\r\npartners : Singapore, Japan, Thailand, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia\r\n\r\nImports:\r\ntotal value: $1.4 billion (1996 est.)\r\ncommodities: cigarettes, construction materials, petroleum products,\r\nmachinery, motor vehicles\r\npartners : Singapore, Vietnam, Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, Indonesia\r\n\r\nDebt - external: $1.9 billion (1994)\r\n\r\nEconomic aid:\r\nrecipient : ODA, $NA\r\nnote: international donors pledged a total of $1.8 billion in 1995 and\r\n1996\r\n\r\nCurrency: 1 new riel (CR) = 100 sen\r\n\r\nExchange rates: riels (CR) per US$1 - 2,723.0 (January 1997), 2,624.1\r\n(1996), 2,450.8 (1995), 2,545.3 (1994), 2,689.0 (1993), 1,266.6 (1992)\r\n\r\nFiscal year: calendar year\r\n\r\n@Cambodia:Communications\r\n\r\nTelephones: 7,000 (1981 est.)\r\n\r\nTelephone system: service barely adequate for government requirements\r\nand virtually nonexistent for general public\r\ndomestic: NA\r\ninternational: landline international service limited to Vietnam and\r\nother adjacent countries;

Still,\r\nit faces many of the serious problems facing other underdeveloped\r\ncountries, such as political instability, a top-heavy civil service,\r\nand a generally unfavorable climate for business enterprise. The\r\ndevelopment of the oil sector led to rapid economic growth between\r\n1970 and 1985. Growth came to an abrupt halt in 1986, precipitated by\r\nsteep declines in the prices of major exports: coffee, cocoa, and\r\npetroleum. Export earnings were cut by almost one-third, and\r\ninefficiencies in fiscal management were exposed. Since 1990, the\r\ngovernment has embarked on various IMF and World Bank programs\r\ndesigned to spur business investment, increase efficiency in\r\nagriculture, improve trade and recapitalize the nation's banks.\r\nPolitical instability, following suspect elections in 1992, has\r\nlimited the effectiveness of aid programs. Currently, Cameroon\r\nreceives only minimal assistance from the IMF and the World Bank.\r\nAlthough the 50% devaluation of the currency of 12 January 1994\r\nimproved the potential for export growth, mismanagement remains and is\r\nthe main barrier to economic improvement. The devaluation led to a\r\nspurt in inflation to 48% in 1994, but it moderated in 1995-96.\r\nProgress toward privatization of remaining state industry remains\r\nslow.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $17.5 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 3.4% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $1,230 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 29%\r\nindustry: 25%\r\nservices: 46% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 6% (FY96/97 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: NA\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues : $2.23 billion\r\nexpenditures: $2.23 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n(FY96/97 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: petroleum production and refining, food processing, light\r\nconsumer goods, textiles, lumber\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 630,000 kW (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 2.71 billion kWh (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 186 kWh (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: coffee, cocoa, cotton, rubber, bananas,\r\noilseed, grains, root starches;

Since\r\nWorld War II, the impressive growth of the manufacturing, mining, and\r\nservice sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural\r\neconomy into one primarily industrial and urban. Canada started the\r\n1990s in recession, and real rates of growth have averaged only 1.1%\r\nso far this decade. Because of slower growth, Canada still faces high\r\nunemployment - especially in Quebec and the Maritime Provinces - and a\r\nlarge public sector debt. With its great natural resources, skilled\r\nlabor force, and modern capital plant, however, Canada will enjoy\r\nbetter economic prospects in the future.

The economy is service\r\noriented, with commerce, transport, and public services accounting for\r\nalmost 70% of GDP. Although nearly 70% of the population lives in\r\nrural areas, the share of agriculture in GNP is only 14%, of which\r\nfishing accounts for 4%. About 90% of food must be imported. The\r\nfishing potential, mostly lobster and tuna, is not fully exploited.\r\nCape Verde annually runs a high trade deficit, financed by remittances\r\nfrom emigrants and foreign aid, which form important supplements to\r\nGDP. Economic reforms, launched by the new democratic government in\r\n1991, are aimed at developing the private sector and attracting\r\nforeign investment to diversify the economy. Prospects for 1997 depend\r\nheavily on the maintenance of aid flows, remittances, and the momentum\r\nof the government's development program.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $472 million (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 4.7% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $1,000 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture : 14%\r\nindustry: 17%\r\nservices: 69% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 7.8% (1995)\r\n\r\nLabor force: NA\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA %\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $253.7 million\r\nexpenditures: $276 million (FY96/97 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: fish processing, salt mining, garments, ship repair, food\r\nand beverages\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 17,000 kW\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 15 million kWh (1991)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 39 kWh (1991 est.)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: bananas, corn, beans, sweet potatoes,\r\nsugarcane, coffee, peanuts;

Timber has accounted\r\nfor about 16% of export earnings and the diamond industry for nearly\r\n54%. Important constraints to economic development include the CAR's\r\nlandlocked position, a poor transportation system, a largely unskilled\r\nwork force, and a legacy of misdirected macroeconomic policies. The\r\n50% devaluation of the currencies of 14 Francophone African nations on\r\n12 January 1994 had mixed effects on the CAR's economy. Diamond,\r\ntimber, coffee, and cotton exports increased, leading an estimated\r\nrise of GDP of 7% in 1994 and nearly 5% in 1995. Inflation, however,\r\nremains a problem.

His transitional\r\ngovernment eventually suppressed armed rebellion in all quarters of\r\nthe country, settled the territorial dispute with Libya on terms\r\nfavorable to Chad, produced a democratic constitution which was\r\nratified by popular referendum in March 1996, held multiparty national\r\npresidential elections in June and July 1996 (DEBY won with 67% of the\r\nvote), and held multiparty elections to the National Assembly in\r\nJanuary and February 1997, in which Idress DEBY's party, Patriotic\r\nSalvation Movement or MPS, won a majority of the seats.\r\n\r\n@Chad:Geography\r\n\r\nLocation: Central Africa, south of Libya\r\n\r\nGeographic coordinates: 15 00 N, 19 00 E\r\n\r\nMap references: Africa\r\n\r\nArea:\r\ntotal: 1.284 million sq km\r\nland: 1,259,200 sq km\r\nwater: 24,800 sq km\r\n\r\nArea - comparative: slightly more than three times the size of\r\nCalifornia\r\n\r\nLand boundaries:\r\ntotal: 5,968 km\r\nborder countries: Cameroon 1,094 km, Central African Republic 1,197\r\nkm, Libya 1,055 km, Niger 1,175 km, Nigeria 87 km, Sudan 1,360 km\r\n\r\nCoastline: 0 km (landlocked)\r\n\r\nMaritime claims: none (landlocked)\r\n\r\nClimate: tropical in south, desert in north\r\n\r\nTerrain: broad, arid plains in center, desert in north, mountains in\r\nnorthwest, lowlands in south\r\n\r\nElevation extremes:\r\nlowest point : Djourab Depression 175 m\r\nhighest point: Emi Koussi 3,415 m\r\n\r\nNatural resources: petroleum (unexploited but exploration under way),\r\nuranium, natron, kaolin, fish (Lake Chad)\r\n\r\nLand use:\r\narable land: 3%\r\npermanent crops : 0%\r\npermanent pastures: 36%\r\nforests and woodland: 26%\r\nother: 35% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nIrrigated land: 140 sq km (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nNatural hazards: hot, dry, dusty harmattan winds occur in north;\r\nperiodic droughts; locust plagues\r\n\r\nEnvironment - current issues: inadequate supplies of potable water;\r\nimproper waste disposal in rural areas contributes to soil and water\r\npollution; desertification\r\n\r\nEnvironment - international agreements:\r\nparty to: Biodiversity, Climate Change, Desertification, Endangered\r\nSpecies, Nuclear Test Ban, Ozone Layer Protection, Wetlands\r\nsigned, but not ratified: Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping\r\n\r\nGeography - note: landlocked; Lake Chad is the most significant water\r\nbody in the Sahel\r\n\r\n@Chad:People\r\n\r\nPopulation: 7,166,023 (July 1997 est.)\r\n\r\nAge structure:\r\n0-14 years: 44% (male 1,586,873; female 1,579,086)\r\n15-64 years: 53% (male 1,854,645; female 1,931,519)\r\n65 years and over: 3% (male 94,516; female 119,384) (July 1997 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation growth rate: 2.67% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nBirth rate: 43.85 births/1,000 population (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nDeath rate: 17.15 deaths/1,000 population (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nNet migration rate: 0 migrant(s)/1,000 population (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nSex ratio:\r\nat birth : 1.04 male(s)/female\r\nunder 15 years: 1 male(s)/female\r\n15-64 years: 0.96 male(s)/female\r\n65 years and over: 0.79 male(s)/female\r\ntotal population: 0.97 male(s)/female (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nInfant mortality rate: 118.7 deaths/1,000 live births (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nLife expectancy at birth:\r\ntotal population: 47.88 years\r\nmale: 45.49 years\r\nfemale: 50.37 years (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nTotal fertility rate: 5.79 children born/woman (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nNationality:\r\nnoun : Chadian(s)\r\nadjective: Chadian\r\n\r\nEthnic groups: Muslims (Arabs, Toubou, Hadjerai, Fulbe, Kotoko,\r\nKanembou, Baguirmi, Boulala, Zaghawa, and Maba), non-Muslims (Sara,\r\nNgambaye, Mbaye, Goulaye, Moundang, Moussei, Massa), nonindigenous\r\n150,000 (of whom 1,000 are French)\r\n\r\nReligions: Muslim 50%, Christian 25%, indigenous beliefs (mostly\r\nanimism) 25%\r\n\r\nLanguages: French (official), Arabic (official), Sara and Sango (in\r\nsouth), more than 100 different languages and dialects\r\n\r\nLiteracy:\r\ndefinition: age 15 and over can read and write in French or Arabic\r\ntotal population: 48.1%\r\nmale : 62.1%\r\nfemale: 34.7% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\n@Chad:Government\r\n\r\nCountry name:\r\nconventional long form: Republic of Chad\r\nconventional short form: Chad\r\nlocal long form : Republique du Tchad\r\nlocal short form: Tchad\r\n\r\nData code: CD\r\n\r\nGovernment type: republic\r\n\r\nNational capital: N'Djamena\r\n\r\nAdministrative divisions: 14 prefectures (prefectures, singular -\r\nprefecture); Batha, Biltine, Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti, Chari-Baguirmi,\r\nGuera, Kanem, Lac, Logone Occidental, Logone Oriental, Mayo-Kebbi,\r\nMoyen-Chari, Ouaddai, Salamat, Tandjile\r\n\r\nIndependence: 11 August 1960 (from France)\r\n\r\nNational holiday: Independence Day, 11 August (1960)\r\n\r\nConstitution: 31 March 1995, passed by referendum\r\n\r\nLegal system: based on French civil law system and Chadian customary\r\nlaw; does not accept compulsory ICJ jurisdiction\r\n\r\nSuffrage: 18 years of age; universal\r\n\r\nExecutive branch:\r\nchief of state: President Lt.

Its economy is hobbled by\r\npolitical turmoil, drought, and food shortages. Consequently the\r\neconomy has shown little progress in recent years in overcoming a\r\nsevere setback brought on by civil war in the late 1980s. About 85% of\r\nthe work force is involved in subsistence farming and fishing. Cotton\r\nis the major cash crop, accounting for at least half of exports. Chad\r\nis highly dependent on foreign aid, especially food credits, given\r\nchronic food shortages in several regions. Of all the Francophone\r\ncountries in Africa, Chad has benefited the least from the 50%\r\ndevaluation of their currencies on 12 January 1994. Despite an\r\nincrease in external financial aid and price increases for cotton -\r\nthe primary source of foreign exchange - the corrupt and enfeebled\r\ngovernment bureaucracy continues to postpone payment of public sector\r\nsalaries and to dampen economic enterprise by neglecting payments to\r\ndomestic suppliers. The devaluation resulted in stepped-up inflation\r\nof 41% in 1994; inflation fell to 9% in 1995 but it remains high\r\ncompared with other Francophone countries. In one favorable\r\ndevelopment, Chad in December 1996 concluded an agreement with\r\nESSO/Chad (EXXON) for drilling and extracting petroleum at Doba. Oil\r\nwill be piped through Cameroon for export.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $3.3 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 2.6% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $600 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 48%\r\nindustry: 18%\r\nservices : 34% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 9% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: NA\r\nby occupation : agriculture 85% (subsistence farming, herding, and\r\nfishing)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues : $136 million\r\nexpenditures: $222 million, including capital expenditures of $107\r\nmillion (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: cotton textiles, meat packing, beer brewing, natron\r\n(sodium carbonate), soap, cigarettes, construction materials\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 40,000 kW (1991)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 70 million kWh (1991)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 14 kWh (1991 est.)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: cotton, sorghum, millet, peanuts, rice,\r\npotatoes, manioc (tapioca);

Civilian governments - which took over from the military in\r\nMarch 1990 - have continued to reduce the government's role in the\r\neconomy while shifting the emphasis of public spending toward social\r\nprograms. Growth in real GDP averaged more than 6.5% in 1991-1996, and\r\ninflation is nearing a 40-year low. Chile's currency and foreign\r\nreserves also are strong, as sustained foreign capital inflows -\r\ndriven in part by state privatizations - have more than offset\r\noccasional current account deficits and public debt buybacks.\r\nPresident FREI, who took office in March 1994, has placed improving\r\nChile's education system and developing foreign export markets at the\r\ntop of his economic agenda. Despite this progress, the Chilean economy\r\nremains largely dependent on a few sectors - particularly copper\r\nmining, fishing, and forestry. Success in meeting the government's\r\ngoal of sustained annual economic growth of 5% depends largely on\r\nworld prices for these commodities, continued foreign investor\r\nconfidence, and the government's ability to maintain a conservative\r\nfiscal stance. In 1996, Chile became an associate member of Mercosur\r\nand concluded a Free Trade Agreement with Canada.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $120.6 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 6.5% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $8,400 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture : 8%\r\nindustry: 33%\r\nservices: 59% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 6.7% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 5.5 million (1996 est.)\r\nby occupation: services 38.3% (includes government 12%), industry and\r\ncommerce 33.8%, agriculture, forestry, and fishing 19.2%, mining 2.3%,\r\nconstruction 6.4% (1990)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 6.5% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $17 billion\r\nexpenditures: $17 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA (1996\r\nest.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: copper, other minerals, foodstuffs, fish processing, iron\r\nand steel, wood and wood products, transport equipment, cement,\r\ntextiles\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 4.8% (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 5.964 million kW (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 27.908 billion kWh (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 1,662 kWh (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: wheat, corn, grapes, beans, sugar beets,\r\npotatoes, fruit;

To this end the\r\nauthorities switched to a system of household responsibility in\r\nagriculture in place of the old collectivization, increased the\r\nauthority of local officials and plant managers in industry, permitted\r\na wide variety of small-scale enterprise in services and light\r\nmanufacturing, and opened the economy to increased foreign trade and\r\ninvestment. The result has been a quadrupling of GDP since 1978.\r\nAgricultural output doubled in the 1980s, and industry also posted\r\nmajor gains, especially in coastal areas near Hong Kong and opposite\r\nTaiwan, where foreign investment helped spur output of both domestic\r\nand export goods. On the darker side, the leadership has often\r\nexperienced in its hybrid system the worst results of socialism\r\n(bureaucracy, lassitude, corruption) and of capitalism (windfall gains\r\nand stepped-up inflation). Beijing thus has periodically backtracked,\r\nretightening central controls at intervals. In 1992-96 annual growth\r\nof GDP accelerated, particularly in the coastal areas - averaging more\r\nthan 10% annually according to official figures. In late 1993 China's\r\nleadership approved additional long-term reforms aimed at giving still\r\nmore play to market-oriented institutions and at strengthening the\r\ncenter's control over the financial system; state enterprises would\r\ncontinue to dominate many key industries in what was now termed \"a\r\nsocialist market economy.\" In 1995-96 inflation dropped sharply,\r\nreflecting tighter monetary policies and stronger measures to control\r\nfood prices. At the same time, the government struggled to (a) collect\r\nrevenues due from provinces, businesses, and individuals; (b) reduce\r\ncorruption and other economic crimes; and (c) keep afloat the large\r\nstate-owned enterprises, most of which had not participated in the\r\nvigorous expansion of the economy and many of which have been losing\r\nthe ability to pay full wages and pensions. From 60 to 100 million\r\nsurplus rural workers are adrift between the villages and the cities,\r\nmany subsisting through part-time low-paying jobs. Popular resistance,\r\nchanges in central policy, and loss of authority by rural cadres have\r\nweakened China's population control program, which is essential to\r\nmaintaining growth in living standards. Another long-term threat to\r\ncontinued rapid economic growth is the deterioration in the\r\nenvironment, notably air pollution, soil erosion, and the steady fall\r\nof the water table especially in the north. China continues to lose\r\narable land because of erosion and economic development; furthermore,\r\nthe regime gives insufficient priority to agricultural research. The\r\nnext few years will witness increasing tensions between a highly\r\ncentralized political system and an increasingly decentralized\r\neconomic system. Rapid economic growth likely will continue but at a\r\ndeclining rate.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $3.39 trillion (1996 estimate as\r\nextrapolated from World Bank estimate for 1995 with use of official\r\nChinese growth figure for 1996;

Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has\r\nexpanded every year for more than 25 years, and unlike many other\r\nLatin American countries, Colombia did not default on any of its\r\nofficial debts during the \"lost decade\" of the 1980s. Since 1990, when\r\nBogota introduced a comprehensive reform program that opened the\r\neconomy to foreign trade and investment, GDP growth has averaged more\r\nthan 4% annually. Growth has been fueled in recent years by the rapid\r\nexpansion of the oil sector, progress in the construction and\r\nfinancial service industries, and an influx of foreign capital. Direct\r\nforeign investment, especially in the oil industry, is rising at a\r\nrapid rate. In 1996, oil overtook coffee as Colombia's main export.\r\nNon-petroleum economic growth slowed, however, due mostly to high\r\ninterest rates - the result of high government spending and a tight\r\nmonetary policy - and a real appreciation of the exchange rate.\r\nBusiness confidence was also damaged by a political crisis stemming\r\nfrom allegations President SAMPER solicited contributions from drug\r\ntraffickers during the 1994 campaign. The slowdown in the growth of\r\nlabor-intensive industries such as manufacturing has caused\r\nunemployment to rise to 11.5% by the end of 1996 and interfered with\r\nPresident SAMPER'S plans to lower the country's poverty rate, which\r\nhas remained at about 40% despite the expanding economy.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $201.4 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 2.1% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $5,400 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture : 20%\r\nindustry: 27%\r\nservices: 53% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 21.6% (1996)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 12 million (1990)\r\nby occupation: services 46%, agriculture 30%, industry 24% (1990)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 11.5% (yearend 1996)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $27 billion\r\nexpenditures: $30 billion including capital expenditures of $NA (1997\r\nest.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: textiles, food processing, oil, clothing and footwear,\r\nbeverages, chemicals, cement;

Agriculture,\r\nincluding fishing, hunting, and forestry, is the leading sector of the\r\neconomy. It contributes nearly 40% to GDP, employs 80% of the labor\r\nforce, and provides most of the exports. The country is not\r\nself-sufficient in food production; rice, the main staple, accounts\r\nfor the bulk of imports. The government is struggling to upgrade\r\neducation and technical training, to privatize commercial and\r\nindustrial enterprises, to improve health services, to diversify\r\nexports, to promote tourism, and to reduce the high population growth\r\nrate.

While\r\nmeaningful economic figures are difficult to come by, the high rate of\r\ninflation, chronic large government deficits, and plunging mineral\r\nproduction have made it one of the world's poorest countries. Most\r\nformal transactions are conducted in hard currency as indigenous bank\r\nnotes have lost almost all value, and a barter economy now flourishes\r\nin all but the largest cities. During the bitter civil strive of\r\n1996-97 most individuals and families have hung on grimly through\r\nsubsistence farming and petty trade. The new KABILA government will be\r\nhard pressed to meet its financial obligations to the IMF or to put in\r\nplace the financial measures advocated by it.

Oil has supplanted forestry as the mainstay of the\r\neconomy, providing about 90% of government revenues and exports. In\r\nthe early 1980s, rapidly rising oil revenues enabled the government to\r\nfinance large-scale development projects with GDP growth averaging 5%\r\nannually, one of the highest rates in Africa. Subsequently, falling\r\noil prices cut GDP growth by half. Moreover, the government has\r\nmortgaged a substantial portion of its oil earnings, contributing to\r\nthe government's shortage of revenues. The 12 January 1994 devaluation\r\nof Franc Zone currencies by 50% resulted in inflation of 61% in 1994\r\nbut inflation has subsided since.

Manufacturing activities are limited to a\r\nfruit-processing plant and several clothing factories. Trade deficits\r\nare made up for by remittances from emigrants and by foreign aid,\r\nlargely from New Zealand. In 1996, the government declared bankruptcy,\r\nciting a $120 million public debt. Efforts to exploit tourism\r\npotential and expanding the mining and fishing industries have not\r\nbeen enough to adequately deal with the financial crisis. In an effort\r\nto stem further erosion of the tenuous economic situation, the\r\ngovernment slashed public service salaries by 50%, condensed the\r\nnumber of government ministries from 52 to 22, reduced the number of\r\ncivil servants by more than half, began selling government assets, and\r\nclosed all overseas diplomatic posts except for the one in New\r\nZealand.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $57 million (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $3,000 (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 17%\r\nindustry: 6%\r\nservices: 77% (FY90/91)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 5.8% (1994)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 6,601 (1993)\r\nby occupation: agriculture 29%, government 27%, services 25%, industry\r\n15%, other 4% (1981)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $NA\r\nexpenditures: $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n\r\nIndustries: fruit processing, tourism\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 7,500 kW (1990)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 20 million kWh (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: NA kWh\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: copra, citrus, pineapples, tomatoes, bananas,\r\nyams, taro, coffee\r\n\r\nExports:\r\ntotal value: $3.9 million (f.o.b., 1993)\r\ncommodities: copra, fresh and canned citrus fruit, clothing, coffee,\r\nfish\r\npartners: NZ 80%, Japan, Hong Kong\r\n\r\nImports:\r\ntotal value : $67 million (c.i.f., 1993)\r\ncommodities: foodstuffs, textiles, fuels, timber\r\npartners: NZ 49%, Italy, Australia\r\n\r\nDebt - external: $160 million (1994)\r\n\r\nEconomic aid:\r\nrecipient: ODA, $1.275 million from Australia (FY96/97 est.);

Poverty has been\r\nsubstantially reduced over the past 15 years, and a strong social\r\nsafety net has been put in place. Recent trends, however, have been\r\ndisappointing. Economic growth slipped from 4.3% in 1994 to 2.5% in\r\n1995, and to 0.9% in 1996. Inflation rose to 22.5% in 1995 from 13.5%\r\nin 1994, then dropped back to 13.9% in 1996. Unemployment appears\r\nmoderate at little more than 5% but substantial underemployment\r\ncontinues. Furthermore, substantial government deficits have\r\nundermined efforts to maintain the quality of social services. The\r\ngovernment thus faces a formidable set of problems: to curb inflation,\r\nreduce the deficit, encourage domestic savings, and improve public\r\nsector efficiency while increasing the role of the private sector, all\r\nthis in harmony with IMF agreements.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $19 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: -0.9% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $5,500 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 18%\r\nindustry: 24%\r\nservices: 58% (1995)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 13.9% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 868,300\r\nby occupation: industry and commerce 35.1%, government and services\r\n33%, agriculture 27%, other 4.9% (1985 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 5.5% (1996 est.);

After several years of lagging\r\nperformance, the Ivorian economy began a comeback in 1994, due to\r\nimproved prices for cocoa and coffee, growth in nontraditional primary\r\nexports such as pineapples and rubber, limited trade and banking\r\nliberalization, offshore oil and gas discoveries, and generous\r\nexternal financing and debt rescheduling by multilateral lenders and\r\nFrance. The 50% devaluation of Franc Zone currencies on 12 January\r\n1994 caused a one-time jump in the inflation rate to 32% for 1994, but\r\nthis rate fell to 8% by 1996, in part as the economy adjusted to the\r\ndevaluation. Moreover, government adherence to donor-mandated reforms\r\nled to a jump in growth rates - 6.5% in GDP in 1996.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $23.9 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 6.5% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $1,620 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 31%\r\nindustry: 20%\r\nservices : 49% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 8% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: NA\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $1.9 billion\r\nexpenditures: $3.4 billion, including capital expenditures of $408\r\nmillion (1993)\r\n\r\nIndustries: foodstuffs, beverages;

Croatia faces considerable economic problems stemming from:\r\nthe legacy of longtime communist mismanagement of the economy; damage\r\nduring the internecine fighting to bridges, factories, power lines,\r\nbuildings, and houses; the large refugee population, both Croatian and\r\nBosnian; and the disruption of economic ties. Western aid and\r\ninvestment, especially in the tourist and oil industries, would help\r\nrestore the economy. The government has been successful in some reform\r\nefforts - partially macroeconomic stabilization policies - and it has\r\nnormalized relations with its creditors. Yet it still is struggling\r\nwith privatization of large state enterprises and with bank reform.\r\nThe draft 1997 budget boosts expenditures on the repair and upgrading\r\nof infrastructure.

The government has\r\nundertaken several reforms in recent years to stem excess liquidity,\r\nincrease labor incentives, and alleviate serious shortages of food,\r\nconsumer goods, and services. The liberalized agricultural markets\r\nintroduced in October 1994, at which state and private farmers sell\r\nabove-quota production at unrestricted prices, have broadened legal\r\nconsumption alternatives and reduced black market prices. Government\r\nefforts to lower subsidies to unprofitable enterprises and to shrink\r\nthe money supply caused the peso's black market value to move from a\r\npeak of 120 to the dollar in the summer of 1994 to a low of 18-20 to\r\nthe dollar in late September before climbing to 20-21 at the end of\r\n1996. New taxes helped drive down the number of legally registered\r\nself-employed workers from 208,000 in January 1996 to 180,000 by\r\nDecember. Havana announced in 1995 that GDP declined by 35% during\r\n1989-1993, the result of lost Soviet aid and domestic inefficiencies.\r\nThe drop in GDP apparently halted in 1994, when Cuba reported a 0.7%\r\ngrowth. Government officials claimed that GDP increased by 2.5% in\r\n1995 and 7.8% in 1996. Export earnings rose an estimated 40% in 1996\r\nto $2.1 billion, largely on the strength of increased sugar shipments\r\nto Russia and higher nickel production through a joint venture with a\r\nCanadian firm. With the economic recovery, imports rose for the second\r\nstraight year, growing by an estimated 26% to $3.5 billion. Living\r\nstandards for the average Cuban, however, have not improved\r\nsignificantly.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $16.2 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 7.8% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $1,480 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 7%\r\nindustry: 31%\r\nservices: 62% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: NA%\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal : 4.71 million economically active population (1989);

Industry contributes 23% to\r\nGDP and employs 25% of the labor force, while the service sector\r\ncontributes 72% to GDP and employs 62% of the labor force. Erratic\r\ngrowth rates in the 1990s reflect the economy's vulnerability to\r\nswings in tourist arrivals (caused by fluctuations in political and\r\neconomic conditions in Western Europe and the Middle East) and the\r\nneed for structural changes in the economy. One bright spot has been\r\nthe low rate of inflation. In 1996 Cyprus fully satisfied all the\r\nMaastricht convergence criteria. The Turkish Cypriot economy has less\r\nthan one-third the per capita GDP of the south. Because it is\r\nrecognized only by Turkey, it has had much difficulty arranging\r\nforeign financing, and foreign firms have hesitated to invest there.\r\nThe economy remains heavily dependent on agriculture and government\r\nservice, which together employ about half of the work force. Moreover,\r\nthe small, vulnerable economy has suffered because the Turkish lira is\r\nlegal tender. To compensate for the economy's weakness, Turkey\r\nprovides direct and indirect aid to nearly every sector. In January\r\n1997, Turkey signed a $250 million economic cooperation accord with\r\nthe Turkish Cypriot area to support tourism, education, and industry.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $8.8 billion (Greek area: purchasing\r\npower parity - $8,300,000,000;

Inflation and unemployment\r\nof 8.7% and 3.3% respectively in 1996 are among the lowest in the\r\nregion. Prague's mass privatization program, including its innovative\r\ndistribution of ownership shares to Czech citizens via \"coupon\r\nvouchers,\" has made the most rapid progress in Eastern Europe. About\r\n80% of the economy is in private hands or is partially privatized. The\r\nCzech Republic appears to be the East European frontrunner in economic\r\nintegration with the West; for example, in 1996 it began to strengthen\r\nits bankruptcy law and to improve the transparency of stock market\r\noperations. It was the first post-Communist member of the OECD and is\r\nexpected to be in the next group of new EU members. Its solid economic\r\nperformance has led Standard and Poor's to upgrade the country's\r\nsovereign credit rating to \"A\" and has attracted over $6.7 billion in\r\ndirect foreign investment to Czech industry between 1990 and September\r\n1996 - one quarter from the US. Prague's biggest macroeconomic\r\nconcerns now are mounting trade and current account deficits. In\r\naddition, the Czech economy still faces transition problems. The\r\ngovernment continues to exert too much direct and indirect influence\r\non the privatized economy, and the management of privatized firms\r\nsometimes is ineffective. Insufficient regulation and lack of public\r\ninformation in the capital markets and the banking system, combined\r\nwith a shortage of experienced financial analysts, limit the ability\r\nto distribute new credit efficiently. The judicial system also has\r\ntrouble speedily processing bankruptcy cases. Prague has promised to\r\noverhaul its bankruptcy law and improve stock market and bank\r\noperations, but it will take years to ensure compliance.

Denmark is a net exporter of\r\nfood. The center-left coalition government will concentrate on\r\nreducing the persistently high unemployment rate and the budget\r\ndeficit as well as following the previous government's policies of\r\nmaintaining low inflation and a current account surplus. The coalition\r\nalso vows to maintain a stable currency. The coalition has lowered\r\nmarginal income taxes while maintaining overall tax revenues; boosted\r\nindustrial competitiveness through labor market and tax reforms and\r\nincreased research and development funds; and improved welfare\r\nservices for the neediest while cutting paperwork and delays.

Two-thirds of the inhabitants live in\r\nthe capital city, the remainder being mostly nomadic herders. Scanty\r\nrainfall limits crop production to fruits and vegetables, and most\r\nfood must be imported. Djibouti provides services as both a transit\r\nport for the region and an international transshipment and refueling\r\ncenter. It has few natural resources and little industry. The nation\r\nis, therefore, heavily dependent on foreign assistance (an important\r\nsupplement to GDP) to help support its balance of payments and to\r\nfinance development projects. An unemployment rate of 40% to 50%\r\ncontinues to be a major problem. Per capita consumption dropped an\r\nestimated 35% over the last six years because of recession, civil war,\r\nand a high population growth rate (including immigrants and refugees).\r\nFaced with a multitude of economic difficulties, the government has\r\nfallen in arrears on long term external debt and has been struggling\r\nto meet the stipulations of foreign aid donors.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $500 million (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: -3.1% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $1,200 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture : 3%\r\nindustry: 21%\r\nservices: 76% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 4.9% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 282,000\r\nby occupation: agriculture 75%, industry 11%, services 14% (1991 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 40%-50% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $150 million\r\nexpenditures: $181 million, including capital expenditures of $34\r\nmillion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: limited to a few small-scale enterprises, such as dairy\r\nproducts and mineral-water bottling\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 115,000 kW (1991)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 200 million kWh (1991)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 577 kWh (1991)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: fruits, vegetables;

In 1996, there was increased mineral and petroleum\r\nexploration, and a new investment law that allows for repatriation of\r\ncapital dividends has drawn more investment to the island. Upon coming\r\nto power in August 1996, President FERNANDEZ nevertheless inherited a\r\ntrouble-ridden economy hampered by a pressured peso, a large external\r\ndebt, nearly bankrupt state-owned enterprises, and a manufacturing\r\nsector hindered by daily power outages. In December, FERNANDEZ\r\npresented a bold economic reform package - including such reforms as\r\nthe devaluation of the peso, income tax cuts, a 50% increase in sales\r\ntaxes, reduced import tariffs, and increased gasoline prices - in an\r\nattempt to create a market-oriented economy that can compete\r\ninternationally.

As an exporter of primary products such as oil,\r\nbananas, and shrimp, fluctuations in world market prices can have a\r\nsubstantial domestic impact. Growth has been uneven in recent years as\r\nthe government has repeatedly initiated ill-conceived fiscal\r\nstabilization measures. The populist government of Abdala BUCARAM\r\nOrtiz proposed a major currency reform in 1996, but popular discontent\r\nwith new austerity measures and rampant official corruption undermined\r\nhis government's position. Congress replaced BUCARAM with Fabian\r\nALARCON in February 1997. ALARCON has adopted a minimalist economic\r\nprogram that puts off major decisions until the next elected\r\ngovernment takes office in August 1998. Ecuador has joined the Word\r\nTrade Organization in 1996, but has failed to comply with many of its\r\naccession commitments. Growth slowed to 2.0% in 1996, due to a lack of\r\ninvestment caused by political uncertainty and high domestic interest\r\nrates.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $47 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 2% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $4,100 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture : 13%\r\nindustry: 38%\r\nservices: 49% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 26% (1996)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 3.4 million\r\nby occupation: agriculture 29%, manufacturing 18%, commerce 15%,\r\nservices and other activities 38% (1990)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 8.5% with widespread underemployment (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $3.6 billion (1997)\r\nexpenditures: $3.6 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n(1996 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: petroleum, food processing, textiles, metal work, paper\r\nproducts, wood products, chemicals, plastics, fishing, lumber\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 3.3% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 2.754 million kW (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 9.27 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 600 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: bananas, coffee, cocoa, rice, potatoes,\r\nmanioc, plantains, sugarcane;

In the face of\r\nthese pressures, in 1991, Egypt undertook wide-ranging macroeconomic\r\nstabilization and structural reform measures. This reform effort has\r\nbeen supported by three successive IMF arrangements, the last of which\r\nwas concluded in October 1996. Egypt's reform efforts - and its\r\nparticipation in the Gulf war coalition - also led to massive debt\r\nrelief under the Paris Club arrangements. Egypt's foreign debt fell to\r\nabout $31 billion at yearend 1996. Although the pace of reform has\r\nbeen uneven and slower than envisaged under the IMF programs,\r\nsubstantial progress has been made in improving macroeconomic\r\nperformance - budget deficits have been slashed while foreign reserves\r\nin 1996 were at an all-time high - and in moving toward a more\r\ndecentralized, market-oriented economy. Egypt was able to capitalize\r\non its progress during the third Middle East/North Africa economic\r\nconference which it hosted in November 1996. Egypt's President MUBARAK\r\ntold reporters that Egypt had concluded deals worth $10 billion in\r\ninvestment during the conference, 20 times the country's estimated\r\ntotal direct foreign investment for the 1995/96 fiscal year. According\r\nto press reports, Egypt and foreign investors agreed on nine\r\nmegaprojects, including the export of liquefied natural gas from Egypt\r\nto Turkey, estimated at $2 billion to $4 billion. Egypt has a\r\nbroad-based inventory of geographic, human, and physical assets which\r\nin a liberalized market environment could spur rapid, sustainable\r\ngrowth into the next century.

Subsistence farming predominates. Although\r\npre-independence Equatorial Guinea counted on cocoa production for\r\nhard currency earnings, the deterioration of the rural economy under\r\nsuccessive brutal regimes has diminished potential for agriculture-led\r\ngrowth. A number of aid programs sponsored by the World Bank and the\r\nIMF have been cut off since 1993 because of the government's gross\r\ncorruption and mismanagement. Businesses, for the most part, are owned\r\nby government officials and their family members. Undeveloped natural\r\nresources include titanium, iron ore, manganese, uranium, and alluvial\r\ngold. Oil exploration, taking place under concessions offered to US,\r\nFrench, and Spanish firms, has been moderately successful and has\r\ncontributed to Equatorial Guinea's strong growth rates in the early\r\n1990s.

Most of the population must continue to depend\r\non subsistence farming. Domestic output (GDP) is substantially\r\naugmented by worker remittances from abroad. Government revenues come\r\nfrom custom duties and income and sales taxes. Road construction is a\r\ntop domestic priority. Shortages persist in housing, education, and\r\nhealth care. Eritrea has inherited the entire coastline of Ethiopia\r\nand has long-term prospects for revenues from the development of\r\noffshore oil, offshore fishing, and tourism. Ethiopia is largely\r\ndependent on Eritrean ports for its foreign commerce.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $2 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 3.9% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $570 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 19%\r\nindustry: 18%\r\nservices : 63% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 8% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: NA\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues : $214 million\r\nexpenditures: $397 million, including capital expenditures of $78\r\nmillion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: food processing, beverages, clothing and textiles\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 73,000 kW (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: NA kWh\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: NA kWh\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: sorghum, lentils, vegetables, maize, cotton,\r\ntobacco, coffee, sisal (for making rope);

Bolstered by a\r\nwidespread national desire to reintegrate into Western Europe, Estonia\r\nhas adhered to disciplined fiscal and financial policies and has led\r\nthe FSU countries in pursuing economic reform. Monthly inflation has\r\nbeen held to 2% in 1995-96. Following four years of decline, Estonia's\r\nGDP grew at 3% in 1995 and 1996. Despite these positive economic\r\nindicators, the current account deficit is widening. The resident IMF\r\nrepresentative in Estonia has been worried since early 1996 about a\r\nrising public sector deficit boosted by local government spending.\r\nSmall- and medium-scale privatization is essentially complete, and\r\nlarge-scale privatization is progressing gradually. In 1996, Estonia's\r\nnational airline was privatized; in 1997 Estonia plans to privatize\r\nlarge infrastructure, i.e., Eesti Energia, Tallinn Port, Estonian\r\nTelecom, and Oil Shale. Estonia has successfully reoriented its trade\r\ntoward the West, two-thirds of exports now going to Western markets.\r\nEstonia's free trade policies were the cornerstone of its negotiations\r\nwith the European Union, and led to the signing of an association\r\nagreement in June 1995. Estonia was the only Baltic state not to have\r\na transition period imposed by the EU prior to its implementation of a\r\nfree trade agreement.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $8.1 billion (1996 estimate as\r\nextrapolated from World Bank estimate for 1994)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 3% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $5,560 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 10%\r\nindustry: 37%\r\nservices : 53% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 23% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 750,000 (1992)\r\nby occupation: industry and construction 42%, agriculture and forestry\r\n20%, other 38% (1990)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 5% (1996 official est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $620 million\r\nexpenditures : $582 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n(January-October 1995)\r\n\r\nIndustries: oil shale, shipbuilding, phosphates, electric motors,\r\nexcavators, cement, furniture, clothing, textiles, paper, shoes,\r\napparel\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 3% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 3.29 million kW (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 8.6 billion kWh (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 4,005 kWh (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: potatoes, fruits, vegetables;

Its economy is based on agriculture, which accounts for more\r\nthan half of GDP, 90% of exports, and 80% of total employment; coffee\r\ngenerates 60% of export earnings. The agricultural sector suffers from\r\nfrequent periods of drought, poor cultivation practices, and\r\ndeterioration of internal security conditions. The manufacturing\r\nsector is heavily dependent on inputs from the agricultural sector.\r\nOver 90% of large-scale industry, but less than 10% of agriculture, is\r\nstate-run. The government is considering selling off a portion of\r\nstate-owned plants and is implementing reform measures that are\r\ngradually liberalizing the economy. A major medium-term problem is the\r\nimprovement of roads, water supply, and other parts of an\r\ninfrastructure badly neglected during years of civil strife.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $24.8 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 7.7% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $430 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 57%\r\nindustry: 10%\r\nservices: 33% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 10% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 18 million\r\nby occupation: agriculture and animal husbandry 80%, government and\r\nservices 12%, industry and construction 8% (1985)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues : $1 billion\r\nexpenditures: $1.48 billion, including capital expenditures of $415\r\nmillion (FY96/97)\r\n\r\nIndustries: food processing, beverages, textiles, chemicals, metals\r\nprocessing, cement\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 630,000 kW (1991)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 1.27 billion kWh (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 23 kWh (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: cereals, pulses, coffee, oilseed, sugarcane,\r\npotatoes, other vegetables;

Dairy farming supports domestic consumption; crops furnish\r\nwinter fodder. Exports feature shipments of high-grade wool to the UK\r\nand the sale of postage stamps and coins. Rich stocks of fish in the\r\nsurrounding waters are not presently exploited by the islanders. So\r\nfar, efforts to establish a domestic fishing industry have been\r\nunsuccessful. The economy has diversified since 1987, when the\r\ngovernment began selling fishing licenses to foreign trawlers\r\noperating within the Falklands exclusive fishing zone. These license\r\nfees total more than $40 million per year and support the island's\r\nhealth, education, and welfare system. To encourage tourism, the\r\nFalkland Islands Development Corporation has built three lodges for\r\nvisitors attracted by the abundant wildlife and trout fishing. The\r\nislands are now self-financing except for defense. The British\r\nGeological Survey announced a 200-mile oil exploration zone around the\r\nislands in 1993, and early seismic surveys suggest substantial\r\nreserves capable of producing 500,000 barrels per day. An agreement\r\nbetween Argentina and the United Kingdom in 1995 seeks to defuse\r\nlicensing and sovereignty conflicts that would dampen foreign interest\r\nin exploiting potential oil reserves.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $NA\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $NA\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: NA%\r\nindustry: NA%\r\nservices: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: NA%\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 1,100 (est.)\r\nby occupation: agriculture 95% (mostly sheepherding)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%;

In the early 1990s, property\r\nvalues plummeted, and the FHRG had to bail out and merge the two\r\nlargest Faroese banks. Fishing is now improving; wage costs are\r\nincreasing; the FHRG's budget is almost in balance; and the large\r\nforeign debt has come down significantly. Nevertheless, the total\r\ndependence on fishing makes the Faroese economy extremely vulnerable,\r\nand the reduction in the foreign debt is at the cost of low\r\ninvestment. Oil finds close to the Faroese area give hope for deposits\r\nin the immediate Faroese area, which may lay the basis for an eventual\r\neconomic rebound. Aided by a substantial annual subsidy from Denmark,\r\nthe Faroese have a standard of living comparable to the Danes and\r\nother Scandinavians.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $800 million (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 6% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $16,300 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 20%\r\nindustry: 16%\r\nservices : 64% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 2.8% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 20,345 (1995 est.)\r\nby occupation: largely engaged in fishing, manufacturing,\r\ntransportation, and commerce\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 11% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues : $467 million\r\nexpenditures: $468 million, including capital expenditures of $11\r\nmillion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: fishing, shipbuilding, construction, handicrafts\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 91,000 kW 000 kW\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 175.4 million kWh\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 4,043 kWh (1995)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: milk, potatoes, vegetables;

Sugar exports\r\nand tourism are the major sources of foreign exchange. Sugar\r\nprocessing makes up one-third of industrial activity. Roughly 250,000\r\ntourists visit each year. Political uncertainty and drought, however,\r\ncontribute to substantial fluctuations in earnings from tourism and\r\nsugar and to the emigration of skilled workers. In 1992, growth was\r\napproximately 3%, based on growth in tourism and a lessening of\r\nlabor-management disputes in the sugar and gold-mining sectors. In\r\n1993, the government's budgeted growth rate of 3% was not achieved\r\nbecause of a decline in non-sugar agricultural output and damage from\r\nCyclone Kina. Growth in 1994 of 5% was largely attributable to\r\nincreased tourism and expansion in the manufacturing sector.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $5.1 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 5% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $6,500 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 21%\r\nindustry: 18%\r\nservices: 61% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 3% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 235,000\r\nby occupation: subsistence agriculture 67%, wage earners 18%, salary\r\nearners 15% (1987)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 6% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $540.65 million\r\nexpenditures : $742.65 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n(1997 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: sugar, tourism, copra, gold, silver, clothing, lumber,\r\nsmall cottage industries\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 2.9% (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 200,000 kW (1993)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 510 million kWh (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 660 kWh (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: sugarcane, coconuts, cassava (tapioca), rice,\r\nsweet potatoes, bananas;

Its key economic sector is manufacturing -\r\nprincipally the wood, metals, and engineering industries. Trade is\r\nimportant, with the export of goods representing about 30% of GDP.\r\nExcept for timber and several minerals, Finland depends on imports of\r\nraw materials, energy, and some components for manufactured goods.\r\nBecause of the climate, agricultural development is limited to\r\nmaintaining self-sufficiency in basic products. Forestry, an important\r\nexport earner, provides a secondary occupation for the rural\r\npopulation. The economy has come back from the recession of 1990-92,\r\nwhich had been caused by economic overheating, depressed foreign\r\nmarkets, and the dismantling of the barter system between Finland and\r\nthe former Soviet Union under which Soviet oil and gas had been\r\nexchanged for Finnish manufactured goods. The Finns voted in an\r\nOctober 1994 referendum to enter the EU, and Finland officially joined\r\nthe Union on 1 January 1995. Attempts to cut the unacceptably high\r\nrate of unemployment and increasing integration with Western Europe\r\nwill dominate the economic picture over the next few years.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $97.1 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 2.5% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $19,000 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture : 7%\r\nindustry: 37%\r\nservices: 56% (1994)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 0.7% (1996)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 2.533 million\r\nby occupation: public services 30.4%, industry 20.9%, commerce 15.0%,\r\nfinance, insurance, and business services 10.2%, agriculture and\r\nforestry 8.6%, transport and communications 7.7%, construction 7.2%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 16.6% (1996)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $25.9 billion\r\nexpenditures: $35 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA (1995\r\nest.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: metal products, shipbuilding, pulp and paper, copper\r\nrefining, foodstuffs, chemicals, textiles, clothing\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 7.4% (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 14.14 million kW (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 60.5 billion kWh (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 12,373 kWh (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: cereals, sugar beets, potatoes;

In running important industrial\r\nsegments (railways, airlines, electricity, telecommunications),\r\nadministering an exceptionally generous social welfare system, and\r\nstaffing an enormous bureaucracy, the state spends about 55% of GDP.\r\nFrance has substantial agricultural resources and a diversified modern\r\nindustrial sector. Large tracts of fertile land, the application of\r\nmodern technology, and subsidies have combined to make it the leading\r\nagricultural producer in Western Europe. Largely self-sufficient in\r\nagricultural products, France is a major exporter of wheat and dairy\r\nproducts. The industrial sector generates about one-quarter of GDP,\r\nand the growing services sector has become crucial to the economy.\r\nFollowing stagnation and recession in 1991-93, French GDP expanded\r\n2.4% in 1994 and in 1995 but at only 1.3% in 1996. Persistently high\r\nunemployment still poses a major problem for the government, as will\r\nthe need to cut back on government spending to keep the economy\r\ninternationally competitive and enable France to qualify for European\r\nEconomic and Monetary Union, slated to introduce a common European\r\ncurrency in January 1999.

Gabon depended on timber and manganese\r\nuntil oil was discovered offshore in the early 1970s. The oil sector\r\nnow accounts for 50% of GDP. Real GDP growth has been feeble since\r\n1991 and Gabon continues to face fluctuating prices for its oil,\r\ntimber, manganese, and uranium exports. Despite an abundance of\r\nnatural wealth and a manageable rate of population growth, the economy\r\nis hobbled by poor fiscal management. In 1992, the fiscal deficit\r\nwidened to 2.4% of GDP, and Gabon failed to settle arrears on its\r\nbilateral debt, leading to a cancellation of rescheduling agreements\r\nwith official and private creditors. Devaluation of its Francophone\r\ncurrency by 50% on 12 January 1994 sparked a one-time inflationary\r\nsurge, to 35%; the rate dropped to 6% in 1996. The IMF provided a\r\none-year standby arrangement in 1994-95 and a three-year Enhanced\r\nFinancing Facility (EFF) at near commercial rates beginning in late\r\n1995. Those agreements mandate progress in privatization and fiscal\r\ndiscipline. France provided additional financial support in January\r\n1997 after Gabon had met IMF targets for mid-1996.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $6.3 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 2.6% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $5,400 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 8.2%\r\nindustry: 44.7%\r\nservices: 47.1% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 6.2% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: NA\r\nby occupation: agriculture 65%, industry and commerce, services\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 10%-14% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $1.3 billion\r\nexpenditures: $1.6 billion, including capital expenditures of $311\r\nmillion (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: food and beverage;

Permanent status negotiations began on 5 May 1996. Under\r\nthe DOP, Israel agreed to transfer certain powers and responsibilities\r\nto the Palestinian Authority, which includes a Palestinian Legislative\r\nCouncil elected in January 1996, as part of interim self-governing\r\narrangements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. A transfer of powers and\r\nresponsibilities for the Gaza Strip and Jericho has taken place\r\npursuant to the Israel-PLO 4 May 1994 Cairo Agreement on the Gaza\r\nStrip and the Jericho Area and in additional areas of the West Bank\r\npursuant to the Israel-PLO 28 September 1995 Interim Agreement. The\r\nDOP provides that Israel will retain responsibility during the\r\ntransitional period for external security and for internal security\r\nand public order of settlements and Israelis.

Gaza has depended upon\r\nIsrael for nearly 90% of its external trade. The Persian Gulf crisis\r\nand its aftershocks has dealt blows to Gaza since August 1990. Worker\r\nremittances from the Gulf states have dropped, unemployment and\r\npopular unrest have increased, and living standards have fallen. The\r\nwithdrawal of Israel from the Gaza Strip in May 1994 has added to the\r\nset of adjustment problems. This series of disruptions has meant a\r\nsharp decline in employment in Israel since 1991 and a drop in GDP as\r\na whole. An estimated 378,000 persons were in refugee camps in 1996.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $1 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: -1% to -2% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $1,100 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture : 33%\r\nindustry: 25%\r\nservices: 42% (1995 est., includes West Bank)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 11% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: NA\r\nby occupation: construction 33.4%, agriculture 20.0%, commerce,\r\nrestaurants, and hotels 14.9%, industry 10.0%, other services 21.7%\r\n(1991)\r\nnote: excluding Israeli settlers\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 35% to 40% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $684 million\r\nexpenditures : $779 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n(1996)\r\nnote: includes West Bank\r\n\r\nIndustries: generally small family businesses that produce textiles,\r\nsoap, olive-wood carvings, and mother-of-pearl souvenirs; the Israelis\r\nhave established some small-scale modern industries in an industrial\r\ncenter\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: NA kW\r\nnote: electricity supplied by Israel\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: NA kWh\r\nnote : electricity supplied by Israel\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: NA kWh\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: olives, citrus, other fruits, vegetables;\r\nbeef, dairy products\r\n\r\nExports:\r\ntotal value: $235 million (f.o.b., 1996 est.)

Separatist conflicts in\r\nAbkhazia and South Ossetia have been dormant since spring 1994,\r\nalthough political settlements remain elusive. Russian peacekeepers\r\nare deployed in both regions and a UN Observer Mission is operating in\r\nAbkhazia. As a result of these conflicts, Georgia still has about\r\n250,000 internally displaced people. In 1995, Georgia adopted a new\r\nconstitution and conducted generally free and fair nationwide\r\npresidential and parliamentary elections. In 1996, the government\r\nfocused its attention to implementing an ambitious economic reform\r\nprogram and professionalizing its parliament. Violence and organized\r\ncrime were sharply curtailed in 1995 and 1996, but corruption remains\r\nrife.\r\n\r\n@Georgia:Geography\r\n\r\nLocation: Southwestern Asia, bordering the Black Sea, between Turkey\r\nand Russia\r\n\r\nGeographic coordinates: 42 00 N, 43 30 E\r\n\r\nMap references: Commonwealth of Independent States\r\n\r\nArea:\r\ntotal: 69,700 sq km\r\nland : 69,700 sq km\r\nwater: 0 sq km\r\n\r\nArea - comparative: slightly smaller than South Carolina\r\n\r\nLand boundaries:\r\ntotal: 1,461 km\r\nborder countries: Armenia 164 km, Azerbaijan 322 km, Russia 723 km,\r\nTurkey 252 km\r\n\r\nCoastline: 310 km\r\n\r\nMaritime claims: NA\r\n\r\nClimate: warm and pleasant;

The country imports the bulk of its energy needs, including\r\nnatural gas and oil products. Its only sizable internal energy\r\nresource is hydropower. Despite the severe damage the economy has\r\nsuffered due to civil strife, Georgia, with the help of the IMF and\r\nWorld Bank, has made substantial economic gains in 1995-96, pushing\r\nGDP growth and slashing inflation. Georgia had been suffering from\r\nacute energy shortages, although energy deliveries improved in 1996.\r\nGeorgia is pinning its hopes for long-term recovery on the development\r\nof an international transportation corridor through the key Black Sea\r\nports of P'ot'i and Bat'umi. The decision in 1996 to construct an\r\nearly Caspian oil pipeline through Georgia underscores the viability\r\nof such a corridor and may spur greater western investment in the\r\neconomy.

The government has implemented an austerity budget in its\r\nattempt to get the deficit down to 3% of GDP as required by\r\nMaastricht, but further cuts probably will be necessary and there is\r\nlittle consensus among the parties or elites about next steps toward\r\nthat end. In recent years business and political leaders have become\r\nincreasingly concerned about Germany's apparent decline in\r\nattractiveness as a business location. They cite the increasing\r\npreference of German companies to locate new manufacturing facilities\r\n- long the strength of the postwar economy - in foreign countries,\r\nincluding the US, rather than in Germany, so they can be closer to\r\ntheir markets and avoid Germany's high taxes and labor costs. At the\r\nsame time, Germany faces its own unique problem of bringing its\r\neastern area up to scratch after 45 years of communist rule. Despite\r\nsubstantial progress toward economic integration, the eastern states\r\nwill continue to rely on the annual subsidy of approximately $100\r\nbillion from the western part into the next century. Assistance from\r\nthe west helped the east to average nearly 8% annual economic growth\r\nin 1992-95, even though the overall German economy had averaged less\r\nthan 2% growth; growth in the east, however, tumbled to 2% in 1996,\r\nwith unemployment a particularly severe problem.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $1.7 trillion (western: purchasing\r\npower parity - $1.56 trillion;

Ghana has made steady progress in\r\nliberalizing its economy since 1983. Overall growth continued at a\r\nrate of approximately 5% in 1995 and 1996, due largely to increased\r\ngold, timber, and cocoa production - major sources of foreign\r\nexchange. The economy, however, continues to revolve around\r\nsubsistence agriculture, which accounts for almost half of GDP and\r\nemploys 55% of the work force, mainly small landholders. In 1995-96,\r\nGhana has made mixed progress under a three-year structural adjustment\r\nprogram in cooperation with the IMF. On the minus side, public sector\r\nwage increases, regional peacekeeping commitments, and the containment\r\nof internal unrest in the underdeveloped north have led to continued\r\ninflationary deficit financing, depreciation of the cedi, and rising\r\npublic discontent with Ghana's austerity program.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $27 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 5% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $1,530 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture : 46%\r\nindustry: 16%\r\nservices: 38% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 36% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 3.7 million\r\nby occupation: agriculture and fishing 54.7%, industry 18.7%, sales\r\nand clerical 15.2%, professional 3.7%, services, transportation, and\r\ncommunications 7.7%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 10% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $1.05 billion\r\nexpenditures: $1.2 billion, including capital expenditures of $178\r\nmillion (1993)\r\n\r\nIndustries: mining, lumbering, light manufacturing, aluminum, food\r\nprocessing\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 3.3% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 1.19 million kW (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 6.1 billion kWh (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 304 kWh (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: cocoa, rice, coffee, cassava (tapioca),\r\npeanuts, corn, shea nuts, bananas;

Tourism is a major\r\nsource of foreign exchange, and agriculture is self-sufficient, except\r\nfor meat, dairy products, and animal feedstuffs. Macroeconomic\r\nproblems include mediocre GDP growth, the huge public sector,\r\nsubstantial budget deficits, and 10% unemployment. The government's\r\nhard drachma policy and public sector wage restraint are largely\r\nresponsible for the downward trend in inflation, now at the lowest\r\nlevel in 22 years. Investment is likely to be the primary engine for\r\neconomic growth in 1997. Athens continues to rely heavily on EU aid,\r\nwhich currently amounts to about 4% of GDP. Despite widespread\r\nprotests from unions and farmers, Prime Minister SIMITIS presented a\r\ntough 1997 budget to help bring Greece closer to meeting the EU\r\ncriteria for participating in economic and monetary union. SIMITIS\r\nfaces strong opposition to further privatization and further\r\nausterity. Plans to increase defense spending could undermine\r\nSIMITIS's goal to curb government expenditures.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $106.9 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 2.2% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $10,000 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 11%\r\nindustry: 25%\r\nservices : 64% (1994)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 8.6% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 4.21 million\r\nby occupation : services 52%, agriculture 23%, industry 25% (1995)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 10% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $33 billion (excluding privatization receipts)\r\nexpenditures: $45 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA (1996\r\nest.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: tourism;

Nonetheless,\r\nprospects for substantial economic growth in the near future are poor.\r\nThe Greenland Home Rule Government (GHRG) has pursued a light fiscal\r\npolicy since the late 1980s which has helped create surpluses in the\r\npublic budget and low inflation. Since 1990, Greenland has registered\r\na foreign trade deficit following the closure of the last remaining\r\nlead and zinc mine in 1989. Greenland today is critically dependent on\r\nfishing and fish exports; the shrimp fishery is by far the largest\r\nincome earner. Despite resumption of several interesting hydrocarbon\r\nand minerals exploration activities, it will take several years before\r\nproduction can materialize. Tourism is the only sector offering any\r\nnear term potential and even this is limited due to a short season and\r\nhigh costs. The public sector, including publicly owned enterprises\r\nand the municipalities, plays the dominant role in Greenland's\r\neconomy. About half the government revenues come from grants from the\r\nDanish Government, an important supplement of GDP.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $892 million (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $15,500 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: NA%\r\nindustry : NA%\r\nservices: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 1.8% (1995)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 24,500 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 10.5% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $706 million\r\nexpenditures: $697 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n(1995)\r\n\r\nIndustries: fish processing (mainly shrimp), handicrafts, furs, small\r\nshipyards\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 92,500 kW\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 274.4 million kWh\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 2,691 kWh (1994-95)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: forage crops, small garden vegetables;

Tourism, the\r\nleading foreign exchange earner, continued to do well, as did\r\nmanufacturing. Construction boomed in 1996 due to concessions for low\r\nand middle income mortgages. The government introduced a 5% tax on\r\nelectricity and telephones and doubled the general consumption tax,\r\nwhich caused a small rise in the inflation rate.

It is also dependent upon France for large\r\nsubsidies and imports. Tourism is a key industry, with most tourists\r\nfrom the US. In addition, an increasingly large number of cruise ships\r\nvisit the islands. The traditionally important sugarcane crop is\r\nslowly being replaced by other crops, such as bananas (which now\r\nsupply about 50% of export earnings), eggplant, and flowers. Other\r\nvegetables and root crops are cultivated for local consumption,\r\nalthough Guadeloupe is still dependent on imported food, which comes\r\nmainly from France. Light industry consists mostly of sugar and rum\r\nproduction.

In both 1990 and 1991, the economy\r\ngrew by 3%, the fourth and fifth consecutive years of mild growth. In\r\n1992 growth picked up to almost 5% as government policies favoring\r\ncompetition and foreign trade and investment took stronger hold. In\r\n1993-94, despite political unrest, this momentum continued, foreign\r\ninvestment held up, and annual growth averaged 4%. Strong\r\ninternational prices for Guatemala's traditional commodity exports\r\nfeatured 4.9% growth in 1995; growth receded to 3% in 1996.

Natural resources are limited, and\r\nfood and raw materials must be imported. Manufacturing and\r\nconstruction account for about 18% of GDP. Goods and services exports\r\naccount for about 50% of GDP.

The reform process slowed in 1993-94, however, in part\r\nbecause of the May 1994 elections and the resulting change in\r\ngovernment. By 1994 the privatization of state firms had ground to a\r\nhalt, while both the budget and current account deficits soared to\r\nunsustainable levels - about 8% and 10% of GDP, respectively. The\r\nsituation improved sharply in 1995: an austerity program introduced in\r\nMarch reduced both deficits; and a renewed privatization effort later\r\nin the year resulted in more than $3 billion worth of sales of state\r\nfirms to foreign investors - money used mostly to reduce Hungary's\r\nlarge foreign debt. Real GDP increased 2.9% in 1994 - following\r\nseveral years of steep decline - and about 1.5% in 1995 and only 0.5%\r\nin 1996. Unemployment reached 14% in early 1993 before gradually\r\nfalling back to 11% in 1996. Inflation has oscillated; it reached 40%\r\nin mid-1991, dropped to 17% in early 1994, jumped back to 31% by\r\nmid-1995, and settled at 20% in 1996. Prospects for 1997 and 1998 are\r\ngood compared with the situation earlier. Most forecasters expect 2%\r\nto 3% GDP growth in 1997 and slightly higher growth in 1998. Inflation\r\nand unemployment are edging down. With the government still committed\r\nto reform, both the budget and current account deficits are at IMF\r\ntarget levels - about 4% of GDP. Budapest also is making good progress\r\nin restructuring the pension, health, tax, education, and other\r\nsystems as part of the effort to decrease the role of government. This\r\ndramatic shift in economic policy was rewarded in 1996 by the IMF,\r\nwhich finally signed the standby agreement Budapest had sought, and by\r\nthe OECD, which welcomed Hungary as a member.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $74.7 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 0.5% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $7,500 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 7.3%\r\nindustry : 31.9%\r\nservices: 60.8% (1994)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 20% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 6.2 million (1996)\r\nby occupation: services 58.7%, industry 34.7%, agriculture 6.6 (1996\r\nest.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 11% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $10.2 billion\r\nexpenditures : $11 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n(1995)\r\n\r\nIndustries: mining, metallurgy, construction materials, processed\r\nfoods, textiles, chemicals (especially pharmaceuticals), motor\r\nvehicles\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 2% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 6.98 million kW (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 31.63 billion kWh (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 3,200 kWh (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: wheat, corn, sunflower seed, potatoes, sugar\r\nbeets;

The economy depends\r\nheavily on the fishing industry, which provides 75% of export earnings\r\nand employs 12% of the work force. In the absence of other natural\r\nresources - except energy - Iceland's economy is vulnerable to\r\nchanging world fish prices. The economy remains sensitive to declining\r\nfish stocks as well as to drops in world prices for its main exports:\r\nfish and fish products, aluminum, and ferrosilicon. The center-right\r\ngovernment plans to continue its policies of reducing the budget and\r\ncurrent account deficits, limiting foreign borrowing, containing\r\ninflation, revising agricultural and fishing policies, diversifying\r\nthe economy, and privatizing state-owned industries. The government\r\nremains opposed to EU membership, primarily because of Icelanders'\r\nconcern about losing control over their fishing resources.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $5.3 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 3.3% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $19,800 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 9.6%\r\nindustry: 22.1%\r\nservices: 68.3% (1991)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 2.5% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 145,000 (1994)\r\nby occupation: commerce, transportation, and services 60.0%,\r\nmanufacturing 12.5%, fishing and fish processing 11.8%, construction\r\n10.8%, agriculture 4.0%, other 0.9% (1990)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 5% (1996)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $1.9 billion\r\nexpenditures: $2.1 billion, including capital expenditures of $297\r\nmillion (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: fish processing;

A large share\r\nof the population, perhaps as much as 40%, remains too poor to afford\r\nan adequate diet. The policy in the 1980s of fueling economic growth\r\nthrough high government expenditure proved unsustainable, however, and\r\nin the wake of an international payments crisis in 1991 India has been\r\ntransforming its semi-socialist, insular economy into a more open,\r\nmarket-oriented economy. Production, trade, and investment reforms\r\nsince 1991 have provided new opportunities for Indian businesspersons\r\nand an estimated 200 million plus middle class consumers. New Delhi\r\nhas stimulated exports, attracted foreign investment, and revived\r\nconfidence in India's economic prospects. GDP growth exceeded 6% in\r\n1995 and in 1996. Most of the country's external fundamentals -\r\nincluding the current account balance and reserves (now about $19\r\nbillion) - are healthy. Even so, the Indian Government needs to\r\nrestore the early momentum of reform, especially by continuing\r\nreductions in the extensive remaining government regulations. The\r\ngovernment will also have to deal with rising government expenditures\r\nand higher debt servicing which could create a debt trap by the turn\r\nof the century. Even if a series of weak coalition governments come to\r\npower in the next few years and are unable to push reforms\r\naggressively, parts of the economy that have already benefited from\r\nderegulation will continue to grow. Moreover, the country can build on\r\nother strengths, including its diverse industrial base, large\r\nscientific and technical pool, its well-developed legal system, and\r\nits large middle class.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $1.538 trillion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 6.5% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $1,600 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 30%\r\nindustry : 28%\r\nservices: 42% (1993/94)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 10.3% (1995)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 370 million (1995 est.)\r\nby occupation: agriculture 65% or more, services 4%, manufacturing and\r\nconstruction 3%, communications and transport 3%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $34 billion\r\nexpenditures: $52.3 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n(FY95/96)\r\n\r\nIndustries: textiles, chemicals, food processing, steel,\r\ntransportation equipment, cement, mining, petroleum, machinery\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 11.2% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 83.288 million kW 1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 380 billion kWh (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 419 kWh (1995)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: rice, wheat, oilseed, cotton, jute, tea,\r\nsugarcane, potatoes;

This was impressive, but not sufficient to cut\r\nunderemployment while absorbing the 2.3 million workers annually\r\nentering the labor force. Foreign investment has boosted manufacturing\r\noutput and exports in recent years. The economy's growth is driven by\r\ncontinuing expansion of nonoil exports. Plantation crops - rubber and\r\npalm oil - and textiles and plywood are being encouraged for both\r\nexport and job generation. Industrial output is based on diverse\r\nnatural resources, including crude oil, natural gas, timber, metals,\r\nand coal. Japan remains Indonesia's most important customer and\r\nsupplier of aid.

In the early 1990s, Iran experienced a financial crisis\r\ncaused by an import surge that began in 1989 and general financial\r\nmismanagement. In 1993-1994, Iran rescheduled $15 billion in debt,\r\nwith the bulk of payments due in 1996-97. The strong oil market in\r\n1996 has helped ease financial pressures, however, and Tehran has so\r\nfar made timely debt service payments. In 1996, Iran's oil earnings -\r\nwhich account for 85% of total export revenues - climbed 20% from the\r\nprevious year. Iran's financial situation will remain tight through\r\nthe end of the decade, and continued timely debt service payments will\r\ndepend, in part, on persistent strong oil prices during the next few\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $343.5 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 3.6% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $5,200 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 21%\r\nindustry : 37%\r\nservices: 42% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 23% (1996)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 15.4 million\r\nby occupation: agriculture 33%, manufacturing 21% (1988 est.)\r\nnote: shortage of skilled labor;

The economy has been dominated by\r\nthe oil sector, which has traditionally provided about 95% of foreign\r\nexchange earnings. In the 1980s, financial problems caused by massive\r\nexpenditures in the eight-year war with Iran and damage to oil export\r\nfacilities by Iran, led the government to implement austerity measures\r\nand to borrow heavily and later reschedule foreign debt payments; Iraq\r\nsuffered economic losses of at least $100 billion from the war. After\r\nthe end of hostilities in 1988, oil exports gradually increased with\r\nthe construction of new pipelines and restoration of damaged\r\nfacilities. Agricultural development remained hampered by labor\r\nshortages, salinization, and dislocations caused by previous land\r\nreform and collectivization programs. The industrial sector, although\r\naccorded high priority by the government, also was under financial\r\nconstraints. Iraq's seizure of Kuwait in August 1990, subsequent\r\ninternational economic embargoes, and military action by an\r\ninternational coalition beginning in January 1991 drastically changed\r\nthe economic picture. Industrial and transportation facilities, which\r\nsuffered severe damage, have been partially restored. Oil exports are\r\nat 25% of the prewar level following the implementation of UN Security\r\nCouncil Resolution 986 in December 1996. Shortages of spare parts\r\ncontinue. The UN-sponsored economic embargo has reduced exports and\r\nimports and has contributed to the sharp rise in prices. The Iraqi\r\nGovernment has been unwilling to abide by UN resolutions so that the\r\neconomic embargo could be removed. The government's policies of\r\nsupporting large military and internal security forces and of\r\nallocating resources to key supporters of the regime have exacerbated\r\nshortages. In accord with a UN resolution Iraq agreed to an\r\noil-for-food deal in 1996, under which it would export $2 billion\r\nworth of oil in exchange for badly needed food and medicine. The first\r\noil was pumped in December 1996, and the first supplies of food and\r\nmedicine should arrive in March 1997. Per capita output for 1995-96\r\nand living standards are well below the 1989-90 level, but any\r\nestimates have a wide range of error.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $42 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 0% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $2,000 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: NA%\r\nindustry: NA%\r\nservices: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: NA%\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 4.4 million (1989)\r\nby occupation: services 48%, agriculture 30%, industry 22%\r\nnote : severe labor shortage;

Although exports remain the primary\r\nengine for Ireland's robust growth, the economy is also benefiting\r\nfrom a rise in consumer spending and recovery in both construction and\r\nbusiness investment. Since the 1980s, inflation has fallen sharply and\r\nchronic trade deficits have been transformed into annual surpluses.\r\nUnemployment remains a serious problem, however, and job creation is\r\nthe main focus of government policy. To ease unemployment, Dublin\r\naggressively courts foreign investors and recently created a new\r\nindustrial development agency to aid small indigenous firms.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $59.9 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 7% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $16,800 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 8.9%\r\nindustry: 38.6%\r\nservices: 52.5% (1994)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 1.8% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 1.474 million (1996 est.)\r\nby occupation: services 62.3%, manufacturing and construction 26.0%,\r\nagriculture, forestry, and fishing 10.6%, utilities 1.1% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 11.9% (April 1996)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues : $22.6 billion\r\nexpenditures: $23.6 billion, including capital expenditures of $4.3\r\nbillion (1995)\r\n\r\nIndustries: food products, brewing, textiles, clothing, chemicals,\r\npharmaceuticals, machinery, transportation equipment, glass and\r\ncrystal\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 8.9% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 3.62 million kW (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 17.9 billion kWh (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 4,343 kWh (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: turnips, barley, potatoes, sugar beets, wheat;\r\nmeat and dairy products\r\n\r\nExports:\r\ntotal value: $43.4 billion (f.o.b., 1995)\r\ncommodities: chemicals, data processing equipment, industrial\r\nmachinery, live animals, animal products\r\npartners: EU 70% (UK 26%, Germany 14%, France 9%), US 6%\r\n\r\nImports:\r\ntotal value: $32.7 billion (c.i.f., 1995)\r\ncommodities : food, animal feed, data processing equipment, petroleum\r\nand petroleum products, machinery, textiles, clothing\r\npartners: EU 58% (UK 37%, Germany 7%, France 4%), US 17%\r\n\r\nDebt - external: $17.5 billion (1995)\r\n\r\nEconomic aid:\r\ndonor: ODA, $81 million (1993)\r\n\r\nCurrency: 1 Irish pound (£Ir) = 100 pence\r\n\r\nExchange rates: Irish pounds (£Ir) per US$1 - 0.6123 (January 1997),\r\n0.6248 (1996), 0.6235 (1995), 0.6676 (1994), 0.6816 (1993), 0.5864\r\n(1992)\r\n\r\nFiscal year: calendar year\r\n\r\n@Ireland:Communications\r\n\r\nTelephones: 900,000 (1987 est.)\r\n\r\nTelephone system: modern digital system using cable and microwave\r\nradio relay\r\ndomestic: microwave radio relay\r\ninternational: satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean)\r\n\r\nRadio broadcast stations: AM 9, FM 45, shortwave 0\r\n\r\nRadios: 2.2 million (1991 est.)\r\n\r\nTelevision broadcast stations: 86 (1987 est.)\r\n\r\nTelevisions: 1.025 million (1990 est.)\r\n\r\n@Ireland:Transportation\r\n\r\nRailways:\r\ntotal: 1,947 km\r\nbroad gauge: 1,947 km 1.600-m gauge (37 km electrified; 485 km double\r\ntrack) (1996)\r\n\r\nHighways:\r\ntotal: 92,430 km\r\npaved : 86,884 km (including 70 km of expressways)\r\nunpaved: 5,546 km (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nWaterways: limited for commercial traffic\r\n\r\nPipelines: natural gas 225 km\r\n\r\nPorts and harbors: Arklow, Cork, Drogheda, Dublin, Foynes, Galway,\r\nLimerick, New Ross, Waterford\r\n\r\nMerchant marine:\r\ntotal : 39 ships (1,000 GRT or over) totaling 130,029 GRT/148,516 DWT\r\nships by type: bulk 1, cargo 27, chemical tanker 2, container 5, oil\r\ntanker 1, short-sea passenger 3 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nAirports: 40 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nAirports - with paved runways:\r\ntotal: 37\r\nover 3,047 m: 1\r\n2,438 to 3,047 m: 1\r\n1,524 to 2,437 m : 3\r\n914 to 1,523 m: 3\r\nunder 914 m: 29 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nAirports - with unpaved runways:\r\ntotal: 3\r\n914 to 1,523 m: 3 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nMilitary\r\n\r\nMilitary branches: Army (includes Naval Service and Air Corps),\r\nNational Police (Garda Siochana)\r\n\r\nMilitary manpower - military age: 17 years of age\r\n\r\nMilitary manpower - availability:\r\nmales age 15-49: 959,807 (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nMilitary manpower - fit for military service:\r\nmales : 778,234 (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nMilitary manpower - reaching military age annually:\r\nmales : 36,560 (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nMilitary expenditures - dollar figure: $618 million (1994)\r\n\r\nMilitary expenditures - percent of GDP: 1.3% (1994)\r\n\r\nTransnational Issues\r\n\r\nDisputes - international: Northern Ireland question with the UK;\r\nRockall continental shelf dispute involving Denmark, Iceland, and the\r\nUK (Ireland and the UK have signed a boundary agreement in the Rockall\r\narea)\r\n\r\nIllicit drugs: transshipment point for and consumer of hashish from\r\nNorth Africa to the UK and Netherlands and of European-produced\r\nsynthetic drugs; transshipment point for heroin and cocaine\r\n______________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nISRAEL\r\n\r\n(also see separate Gaza Strip and West Bank entries)\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\nCurrent issues: The territories occupied by Israel since the 1967 war\r\nare not included in the data below, unless otherwise noted.

It depends on imports of crude oil, grains,\r\nraw materials, and military equipment. Despite limited natural\r\nresources, Israel has intensively developed its agricultural and\r\nindustrial sectors over the past 20 years. Manufacturing and\r\nconstruction employ about 29% of Israeli workers, agriculture,\r\nforestry, and fishing 3.5%, and services the rest. Israel is largely\r\nself-sufficient in food production except for grains. Diamonds,\r\nhigh-technology equipment, and agricultural products (fruits and\r\nvegetables) are leading exports. Israel usually posts sizable current\r\naccount deficits, which are covered by large transfer payments from\r\nabroad and by foreign loans. Roughly half of the government's external\r\ndebt is owed to the US, which is its major source of economic and\r\nmilitary aid. To earn needed foreign exchange, Israel has been\r\ntargeting high-technology niches in international markets, such as\r\nmedical scanning equipment.

This basically capitalistic economy is still\r\ndivided into a developed industrial north, dominated by private\r\ncompanies, and a less developed agricultural south, with large public\r\nenterprises. Most raw materials needed by industry and over 75% of\r\nenergy requirements must be imported. In the second half of 1992, Rome\r\nbecame unsettled by the prospect of not qualifying to participate in\r\nEU plans for economic and monetary union later in the decade; thus, it\r\nfinally began to address its huge fiscal imbalances. Subsequently, the\r\ngovernment has adopted fairly stringent budgets, abandoned its\r\ninflationary wage indexation system, and started to scale back its\r\ngenerous social welfare programs, including pension and health care\r\nbenefits. In November 1996 the lire rejoined the European monetary\r\nsystem, which it had left in September 1992 when under extreme\r\npressure in currency markets. Italy in early 1997 faces the problem of\r\nrestructuring its economy to meet Maastricht criteria for inclusion in\r\nthe EMU, together with other problems of refurbishing a tottering\r\ncommunications system, curbing industrial pollution, and adjusting to\r\nnew EU and global competitive forces.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $1.12 trillion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 0.8% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $19,600 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 3.3%\r\nindustry : 33%\r\nservices: 63.7% (1994)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 4% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 22.851 million\r\nby occupation: services 61%, industry 32%, agriculture 7% (1996)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 12% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $416 billion\r\nexpenditures : $506 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n(1996 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: tourism, machinery, iron and steel, chemicals, food\r\nprocessing, textiles, motor vehicles, clothing, footwear, ceramics\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 0.5% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 57.19 million kW (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 241.6 billion kWh (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 4,238 kWh (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: fruits, vegetables, grapes, potatoes, sugar\r\nbeets, soybeans, grain, olives;

One notable characteristic of the economy is the working\r\ntogether of manufacturers, suppliers, and distributors in closely knit\r\ngroups called keiretsu. A second basic feature has been the guarantee\r\nof lifetime employment for a substantial portion of the urban labor\r\nforce; this guarantee is slowly eroding. Industry, the most important\r\nsector of the economy, is heavily dependent on imported raw materials\r\nand fuels. The much smaller agricultural sector is highly subsidized\r\nand protected, with crop yields among the highest in the world.\r\nUsually self-sufficient in rice, Japan must import about 50% of its\r\nrequirements of other grain and fodder crops. Japan maintains one of\r\nthe world's largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the\r\nglobal catch. For three decades overall real economic growth had been\r\nspectacular: a 10% average in the 1960s, a 5% average in the 1970s,\r\nand a 4% average in the 1980s. Growth slowed considerably in 1992-95\r\nlargely because of the aftereffects of overinvestment during the late\r\n1980s and contractionary domestic policies intended to wring\r\nspeculative excesses from the stock and real estate markets. Growth\r\npicked up in 1996, largely a reflection of stimulative fiscal and\r\nmonetary policies as well as low rates of inflation and social\r\ndisorder. As a result of the expansionary fiscal policies and\r\ndeclining tax revenues due to the recession, Japan currently has one\r\nof the largest budget deficits as a percent of GDP among the\r\nindustrialized countries. The crowding of habitable land area and the\r\naging of the population are two other major long-run problems.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $2.85 trillion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 3.6% (1996)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $22,700 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 2%\r\nindustry : 41.5%\r\nservices: 56.5% (1995)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 0.3% (1996)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 67.23 million (March 1997)\r\nby occupation: trade and services 50%, manufacturing, mining, and\r\nconstruction 33%, utilities and communication 7%, agriculture,\r\nforestry, and fishing 6%, government 3% (1994)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 3.4% (1996)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $528 billion\r\nexpenditures: $673 billion, including capital expenditures (public\r\nworks only) of about $75 billion (FY97/98 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: among world's largest and technologically advanced\r\nproducers of steel and nonferrous metallurgy, heavy electrical\r\nequipment, construction and mining equipment, motor vehicles and\r\nparts, electronic and telecommunication equipment, machine tools,\r\nautomated production systems, locomotives and railroad rolling stock,\r\nships, chemicals;

In\r\nrecent years, the government has encouraged light industry to locate\r\nin Jersey, with the result that an electronics industry has developed\r\nalongside the traditional manufacturing of knitwear.

In the remainder of the 1980s, however, reductions in\r\nboth Arab aid and worker remittances slowed real economic growth to an\r\naverage of roughly 2% per year. Imports - mainly oil, capital goods,\r\nconsumer durables, and food - outstripped exports, with the difference\r\ncovered by aid, remittances, and borrowing. In mid-1989, the Jordanian\r\nGovernment began debt-rescheduling negotiations and agreed to\r\nimplement an IMF-supported program designed to gradually reduce the\r\nbudget deficit and implement badly needed structural reforms. The\r\nPersian Gulf crisis that began in August 1990, however, aggravated\r\nJordan's already serious economic problems, forcing the government to\r\nshelve the IMF program, stop most debt payments, and suspend\r\nrescheduling negotiations. Aid from Gulf Arab states, worker\r\nremittances, and trade contracted; and refugees flooded the country,\r\nproducing serious balance-of-payments problems, stunting GDP growth,\r\nand straining government resources.

It also\r\nhas considerable agricultural potential with its vast steppe lands\r\naccommodating both livestock and grain production. Kazakstan's\r\nindustrial sector rests on the extraction and processing of these\r\nnatural resources and also on a relatively large machine building\r\nsector specializing in construction equipment, tractors, agricultural\r\nmachinery, and some defense items. The breakup of the USSR and the\r\ncollapse of demand for Kazakstan's traditional heavy industry products\r\nhave resulted in a sharp contraction of the economy since 1991, with\r\nthe steepest annual decline occurring in 1994. In 1995-96 the pace of\r\nthe government program of economic reform and privatization quickened,\r\nresulting in a substantial shifting of assets into the private sector.\r\nThe December 1996 signing of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium agreement\r\nto build a new pipeline from Kazakstan's western Tengiz oil field to\r\nthe Black Sea increases prospects for substantially larger oil exports\r\nin several years. The emigration of large numbers of skilled Slavic\r\nmanagers and technicians from the northern industrial areas will hold\r\nback future growth.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $48.6 billion (1996 estimate as\r\nextrapolated from World Bank estimate for 1994)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 1.1% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $2,880 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 12%\r\nindustry: 30%\r\nservices : 58% (1995)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 28.7% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 6.9 million\r\nby occupation: industry 27%, agriculture and forestry 23%, other 50%\r\n(1996)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 2.6% includes only officially registered\r\nunemployed;

Steps\r\nhave included the removal of import licensing and price controls,\r\nremoval of foreign exchange controls, fiscal and monetary restraint,\r\nand reduction of the public sector through privatization of publicly\r\nowned companies and downsizing the civil service. With the support of\r\nthe World Bank, IMF, and other donors, these reforms have led to a\r\nturnaround in economic performance following a period of negative\r\ngrowth in the early 1990s. Kenya's real GDP grew at 5% in 1995 and 4%\r\nin 1996, and inflation remained under control. Substantial barriers to\r\ngrowth and development remain, including electricity shortages, the\r\ngovernment's continued and inefficient dominance of key sectors,\r\nendemic corruption, and the country's high population growth rate\r\n(which has declined substantially in recent years).\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $39.2 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 4% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $1,400 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 29.7%\r\nindustry: 11.1%\r\nservices: 59.2% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 1.6% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 8.78 million (1993 est.)\r\nby occupation: agriculture 75%-80%, non-agriculture 20%-25%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 35% urban (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $2.7 billion\r\nexpenditures : $2.7 billion, including capital expenditures of $620\r\nmillion (FY95/96)\r\n\r\nIndustries: small-scale consumer goods (plastic, furniture, batteries,\r\ntextiles, soap, cigarettes, flour), processing agricultural products;\r\noil refining, cement;

Commercially viable phosphate\r\ndeposits were exhausted at the time of independence in 1979. Copra and\r\nfish now represent the bulk of production and exports. The economy has\r\nfluctuated widely in recent years. Real GDP growth has declined from\r\nabout 10% in 1988 to about 2.6% in 1995. Economic development is\r\nconstrained by a shortage of skilled workers, weak infrastructure, and\r\nremoteness from international markets. The financial sector is at an\r\nearly stage of development. Foreign financial aid, largely from the UK\r\nand Japan, is a critical supplement to GDP, equal in amount to 25%-50%\r\nof GDP in recent years.

agricultural land is collectivized; and state-owned\r\nindustry produces 95% of manufactured goods. State control of economic\r\naffairs is unusually tight even for a communist country because of the\r\nsmall size and homogeneity of the society and the strict rule of KIM\r\nIl-song in the past and now his son, KIM Chong-il. Economic growth\r\nduring the period 1984-88 averaged 2%-3%, but output declined by an\r\naverage of 4%-5% annually during 1989-96 because of systemic problems\r\nand disruptions in socialist-style economic relations and\r\ntechnological links with the former USSR and China. The leadership has\r\ninsisted on maintaining its high level of military outlays from a\r\nshrinking economic pie. Moreover, a serious drawdown in inventories\r\nand critical shortages in the energy sector have led to increasing\r\ninterruptions in industrial production. Abundant mineral resources and\r\nhydropower have formed the basis of industrial development since World\r\nWar II. Manufacturing is centered on heavy industry, including\r\nmilitary industry, with light industry lagging far behind. Despite the\r\nuse of improved seed varieties, expansion of irrigation, and the heavy\r\nuse of fertilizers, North Korea has not yet become self-sufficient in\r\nfood production. Indeed, a shortage of arable lands, several years of\r\npoor harvests, systemic inefficiencies, a cumbersome distribution\r\nsystem, and extensive floods in 1995-96 have resulted in recurring\r\nfood shortages. Substantial grain shipments from Japan and South Korea\r\nare offsetting a portion of the losses. North Korea remains far behind\r\nSouth Korea in economic development and living standards.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $20.9 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: -5% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $900 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 25%\r\nindustry: 60%\r\nservices: 15% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: NA%\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 9.615 million\r\nby occupation: agricultural 36%, nonagricultural 64%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $19.3 billion\r\nexpenditures : $19.3 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n(1992 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: military products;

Three decades ago\r\nits GDP per capita was comparable with levels in the poorer countries\r\nof Africa and Asia. Today its GDP per capita is eight times India's,\r\n15 times North Korea's, and already up with the lesser economies of\r\nthe European Union. This success has been achieved by a unique system\r\nof guidance by an authoritarian government of what is essentially an\r\nentrepreneurial process. The government has sponsored large-scale\r\nadoption of technology and management from Japan and other modern\r\nnations; has successfully pushed the development of export industries\r\nwhile encouraging the import of machinery and materials at the expense\r\nof consumer goods; and has pushed its labor force to a work effort\r\nseldom matched anywhere even in wartime. Real GDP grew by an average\r\n10% in 1986-91, then paused to a \"mere\" 5% in 1992-93, moved back up\r\nto 8% in 1994 and 9% in 1995, and about 7% in 1996. With a much higher\r\nstandard of living and with a considerable easing of authoritarian\r\ncontrols, the work pace has softened. Growth rates will probably slow\r\ndown over the medium term.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $647.2 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 6.9% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $14,200 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 8%\r\nindustry: 45%\r\nservices: 47% (1991 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 5% (1996)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 20 million\r\nby occupation: services and other 52%, mining and manufacturing 27%,\r\nagriculture, fishing, forestry 21% (1991)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 1.9% (1996)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $69 billion\r\nexpenditures : $67 billion, including capital expenditures of $17\r\nbillion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: electronics, automobile production, chemicals,\r\nshipbuilding, steel, textiles, clothing, footwear, food processing\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 11.9% (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 31.67 million kW (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 155.89 billion kWh (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 3,563 kWh (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: rice, root crops, barley, vegetables, fruit;\r\ncattle, pigs, chickens, milk, eggs;

Kuwait has rebuilt its war-ravaged petroleum sector; its\r\ncrude oil production averaged 2 million barrels per day in 1996.\r\nPetroleum accounts for nearly half of GDP, 90% of export revenues, and\r\n75% of government income. Kuwait lacks water and has practically no\r\narable land, thus preventing development of agriculture. With the\r\nexception of fish, it depends almost wholly on food imports. About 75%\r\nof potable water must be distilled or imported. Because of its high\r\nper capita income, comparable with Western European incomes, Kuwait\r\nprovides its citizens with extensive health, educational, and\r\nretirement benefits. The bulk of the work force is non-Kuwaiti, living\r\nat a considerably lower level. Per capita military expenditures are\r\namong the highest in the world. The economy improved moderately in\r\n1994-96, with the growth in industry and finance. The World Bank has\r\nurged Kuwait to push ahead with privatization, including in the oil\r\nindustry, but the government will move slowly on opening the petroleum\r\nsector.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $32.5 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 3% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $16,700 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 0%\r\nindustry : 42%\r\nservices: 58% (1994)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 4.5% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 1 million (1994 est.)\r\nby occupation: industry and agriculture 25%, services 25%, government\r\nand social services 50% (1994 est.)\r\nnote: 72.07% of the population in the 15-64 age group is non-national\r\n(July 1997 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 1.8% (official 1996 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $10 billion\r\nexpenditures : $14 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n(FY96/97 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: petroleum, petrochemicals, desalination, food processing,\r\nconstruction materials, salt, construction\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 1% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 6.99 million kW (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 21.76 billion kWh (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 12,793 kWh (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: practically no crops;

The results, starting from\r\nan extremely low base, have been striking - growth has averaged 7.5%\r\nannually since 1988. Even so, Laos is a landlocked country with a\r\nprimitive infrastructure. It has no railroads, a rudimentary road\r\nsystem, and limited external and internal telecommunications.\r\nElectricity is available in only a few urban areas. Subsistence\r\nagriculture accounts for half of GDP and provides 80% of total\r\nemployment. The predominant crop is rice. In non-drought years, Laos\r\nis self-sufficient overall in food, but each year flood, pests, and\r\nlocalized drought cause shortages in various parts of the country. For\r\nthe foreseeable future the economy will continue to depend on aid from\r\nthe IMF and other international sources; aid from the former\r\nUSSR/Eastern Europe has been cut sharply. As in many developing\r\ncountries, deforestation and soil erosion will hamper efforts to\r\nmaintain the high rate of GDP growth.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $5.7 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 7.5% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $1,150 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 56%\r\nindustry: 19%\r\nservices: 25% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 15% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 1 million-1.5 million\r\nby occupation: agriculture 80% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 5.6% in urban areas (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues : $218 million\r\nexpenditures: $379 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n(1996 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: tin and gypsum mining, timber, electric power,\r\nagricultural processing, construction\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 7.5% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 261,000 kW (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 890 million kWh (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 48 kWh (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: sweet potatoes, vegetables, corn, coffee,\r\nsugarcane, cotton;

Two major long-term concerns are the\r\ngrowing trade deficit and the impact of organized crime. The economy\r\nin 1996 has largely recovered from the mid-1995 collapse of several\r\ncommercial banks - including Latvia's large bank, Bank Baltija - and a\r\nsevere government budget crisis. Prime Minister SKELE has stated that\r\nhe expects the country's GDP to grow 5% in 1997 through the\r\nimplementation of the government's new economic reform program. In\r\nDecember 1996, the government passed a balanced 1997 budget - its\r\nfirst - that SKELE predicts will reduce inflation to 10% to 12% in\r\n1997. Unemployment, which has held steady at about 6% over the past\r\ntwo years, reached roughly 7.5% in 1996. One of SKELE's key objectives\r\nfor 1997 is to speed up the privatization program, which has lagged\r\nbehind other areas of reform.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $9.4 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 2.5% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $3,800 (1996 estimate as\r\nextrapolated from World Bank estimate for 1994)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 9%\r\nindustry : 34%\r\nservices: 57% (1994)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 13.2% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 1.268 million (1995)\r\nby occupation: industry 41%, agriculture and forestry 16%, services\r\n43% (1990)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 7.5% (1996 official est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $NA\r\nexpenditures : $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n\r\nIndustries: buses, vans, street and railroad cars, synthetic fibers,\r\nagricultural machinery, fertilizers, washing machines, radios,\r\nelectronics, pharmaceuticals, processed foods, textiles;

Most of the militias have\r\nbeen weakened or disbanded. The Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) has seized\r\nvast quantities of weapons used by the militias during the war and\r\nextended central government authority over about one-half of the\r\ncountry. Hizballah, the radical Shi'a party, retains most of its\r\nweapons. Foreign forces still occupy areas of Lebanon. Israel\r\nmaintains troops in southern Lebanon and continues to support a proxy\r\nmilitia, the Army of South Lebanon (ASL), along a narrow stretch of\r\nterritory contiguous to its border. The ASL's enclave encompasses this\r\nself-declared security zone and about 20 kilometers north to the\r\nstrategic town of Jazzin. Syria maintains about 30,000 troops in\r\nLebanon. These troops are based mainly in Beirut, North Lebanon, and\r\nthe Bekaa Valley. Syria's deployment was legitimized by the Arab\r\nLeague during Lebanon's civil war and in the Ta'if accord. Citing the\r\ncontinued weakness of the LAF, Beirut's requests, and failure of the\r\nLebanese Government to implement all of the constitutional reforms in\r\nthe Ta'if accord, Damascus has so far refused to withdraw its troops\r\nfrom Lebanon.\r\n\r\n@Lebanon:Geography\r\n\r\nLocation: Middle East, bordering the Mediterranean Sea, between Israel\r\nand Syria\r\n\r\nGeographic coordinates: 33 50 N, 35 50 E\r\n\r\nMap references: Middle East\r\n\r\nArea:\r\ntotal: 10,400 sq km\r\nland: 10,230 sq km\r\nwater : 170 sq km\r\n\r\nArea - comparative: about 0.7 times the size of Connecticut\r\n\r\nLand boundaries:\r\ntotal : 454 km\r\nborder countries: Israel 79 km, Syria 375 km\r\n\r\nCoastline: 225 km\r\n\r\nMaritime claims:\r\nterritorial sea : 12 nm\r\n\r\nClimate: Mediterranean;

Economic recovery has been helped by a financially sound\r\nbanking system and resilient small- and medium-scale manufacturers,\r\nwith family remittances, banking services, manufactured and farm\r\nexports, and international aid as the main sources of foreign\r\nexchange. Lebanon's economy has made impressive gains since Prime\r\nMinister HARIRI launched his $18 billion \"Horizon 2000\" reconstruction\r\nprogram in 1993. Real GDP grew 8% in 1994 and 7% in 1995 before\r\nIsrael's Operation Grapes of Wrath in April 1996 stunted economic\r\nactivity. During 1992-96, annual inflation fell from more than 170% to\r\n10%, and foreign exchange reserves jumped to more than $4 billion from\r\n$1.4 billion. Burgeoning capital inflows have fueled foreign payments\r\nsurpluses, and the Lebanese pound has remained relatively stable.\r\nProgress also has been made in rebuilding Lebanon's war-torn physical\r\nand financial infrastructure. Solidere, a $2-billion firm, is managing\r\nthe reconstruction of Beirut's central business district, the stock\r\nmarket reopened in January 1996, and international banks and insurance\r\ncompanies are returning. The government nonetheless faces serious\r\nchallenges in the economic arena. The government has had to fund\r\nreconstruction by tapping foreign exchange reserves and boosting\r\nborrowing. The stalled peace process and ongoing violence in southern\r\nLebanon could spawn wider hostilities that would disrupt vital capital\r\ninflows. Furthermore, the gap between rich and poor has widened since\r\nHARIRI took office, sowing grassroots dissatisfaction over the skewed\r\ndistribution of reconstruction's benefits and leading the government\r\nto shift its focus from rebuilding infrastructure to improving social\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $13 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 3.5% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $3,400 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 13%\r\nindustry: 28%\r\nservices: 59% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 10% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 1 million plus as many as 1 million foreign workers\r\nby occupation: services 60%, industry 28%, agriculture 12% (1990 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 20% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $1.9 billion\r\nexpenditures: $3.9 billion, including capital expenditures of $1\r\nbillion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: banking;

Its economy is based on\r\nagriculture, light manufacturing, and remittances from miners employed\r\nin South Africa. The number of such mine workers has declined steadily\r\nover the past five years; in 1996 their remittances added about 33% to\r\nGDP compared with the addition of roughly 67% in 1990. The great\r\nmajority of households gain their livelihoods from subsistence farming\r\nand migrant labor; a large portion of the adult male work force is\r\nemployed in South African mines. Manufacturing depends largely on farm\r\nproducts which support the milling, canning, leather, and jute\r\nindustries. Although drought has decreased agricultural activity over\r\nthe past few years, completion of a major hydropower facility will\r\npermit the sale of water to South Africa and will support the\r\neconomy's continued expansion.

The deterioration\r\nof economic conditions has been greatly exacerbated by the flight of\r\nmost business people with their expertise and capital. Civil order\r\nended in 1990 when President Samuel Kenyon DOE was killed by rebel\r\nforces. In April 1996, when forces loyal to faction leaders Charles\r\nGhankay TAYLOR and Alhaji KROMAH attacked rival ethnic Krahn factions,\r\nthe fighting further damaged Monrovia's dilapidated infrastructure.\r\nFighting waned in late May 1996, allowing West African peacekeepers to\r\nregain control of Monrovia. The Abuja II peace accord was signed in\r\nAugust 1996 replacing the Chairman of the ruling Council of State,\r\nWilton SANKAWULO, with Ruth PERRY.

In 1990 per capita GDP was\r\nthe highest in Africa at $5,410, but subsequently GDP growth has\r\nslowed on average and has fluctuated sharply in response to changes in\r\nthe world oil market. Import restrictions and inefficient resource\r\nallocations have led to periodic shortages of basic goods and\r\nfoodstuffs. The nonoil manufacturing and construction sectors, which\r\naccount for about 20% of GDP, have expanded from processing mostly\r\nagricultural products to include the production of petrochemicals,\r\niron, steel, and aluminum. Although agriculture accounts for only 5%\r\nof GDP, it employs 18% of the labor force.

With the help of the IMF and other\r\ninternational institutions, the government has adopted a disciplined\r\nprogram to restrain inflation, abolish most price controls, lower the\r\nbudget deficit, and privatize the economy. More than two-thirds of its\r\nindustrial facilities as well as most housing and agricultural\r\nenterprises have been privatized. Although some important \"strategic\"\r\nenterprises remain exempt from privatization, the new government has\r\noutlined plans to privatize large companies dealing with transport,\r\npipelines, communications, and energy. While Lithuania has reduced its\r\ntrade dependence on Russia and other republics of the FSU from 85% in\r\n1991 to about 40% in 1995, Russia remains Lithuania's leading trading\r\npartner. Lithuania has made great strides in reducing its annual rate\r\nof inflation - from over 1,100% in 1992 to about 35% in 1995 and 13.1%\r\nin 1996. Although the government tried to stay the course on economic\r\nreform and fiscal discipline in 1996, the new government, which took\r\noffice in 1996 inherited high debts for energy supplies. As for real\r\nresources, Lithuania's growth depends largely on its ability to\r\nexploit its strategic location - with its ice-free port at Klaipeda\r\nand its rail and highway hub in Vilnius connecting it with Eastern\r\nEurope, Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine. Lacking important natural\r\nresources, it will remain dependent on imports of fuels and raw\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $14.1 billion (1996 estimate as\r\nextrapolated from World Bank estimate for 1994)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 3.4% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $3,870 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 13%\r\nindustry: 32%\r\nservices: 55% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 13.1% (1996 official est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal : 1.836 million\r\nby occupation: industry and construction 42%, agriculture and forestry\r\n18%, other 40% (1990)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 8% (January 1997)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $1.4 billion\r\nexpenditures: $1.5 billion, including capital expenditures of $168\r\nmillion (1995)\r\n\r\nIndustries: metal-cutting machine tools, electric motors, television\r\nsets, refrigerators and freezers, petroleum refining, shipbuilding\r\n(small ships), furniture making, textiles, food processing,\r\nfertilizers, agricultural machinery, optical equipment, electronic\r\ncomponents, computers, amber\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 3.7% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 5.46 million kW (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 9.57 billion kWh (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 2,151 kWh (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: grain, potatoes, sugar beets, vegetables;\r\nmeat, milk, eggs;

Agriculture, including fishing and forestry, is the\r\nmainstay of the economy, accounting for 33% of GDP and contributing\r\nmore than 70% to export earnings. Industry features the processing of\r\nagricultural products and textile manufacturing. Growth in output in\r\n1992-95 averaged only 1.4%, less than half the growth rate of the\r\npopulation. Growth has been held back by antigovernment strikes and\r\ndemonstrations, a decline in world coffee demand, and the erratic\r\ncommitment of the government to economic reform. Formidable obstacles\r\nstand in the way of Madagascar's realizing its considerable growth\r\npotential; the extent of government reforms, outside financial aid,\r\nand foreign investment will be key determinants.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $12.1 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 3.5% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $880 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture : 33%\r\nindustry: 15%\r\nservices: 52% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 47% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 4.9 million\r\nby occupation : agriculture 45,500, domestic service 29,750, industry\r\n26,250, commerce 24,500, construction 19,250, service 15,750,\r\ntransportation 10,500, other 3,500 (1985 est.)\r\nnote: 175,000 workers (3.6% of the total work force) earn money wages;\r\n4,725,000 workers receive no monetary wage (of these, 91% are engaged\r\nin subsistence agriculture)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues : $250 million\r\nexpenditures: $265 million, including capital expenditures of $180\r\nmillion (1991 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: meat processing, soap, breweries, tanneries, sugar,\r\ntextiles, glassware, cement, automobile assembly plant, paper,\r\npetroleum, tourism\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 3.8% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 208,000 kW (1991)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 450 million kWh (1991)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 36 kWh (1992)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: coffee, vanilla, sugarcane, cloves, cocoa,\r\nrice, cassava (tapioca), beans, bananas, peanuts;

In 1994, tourism,\r\nMaldives largest industry, accounted for about 18% of GDP and more\r\nthan 60% of the Maldives' foreign exchange receipts. Fishing is a\r\nsecond leading growth sector. Over 90% of government tax revenue comes\r\nfrom import duties and tourism-related taxes. The Maldivian Government\r\ninitiated an economic reform program in 1989 initially by lifting\r\nimport quotas and opening some exports to the private sector.\r\nSubsequently, it has liberalized regulations to allow more foreign\r\ninvestment. Agriculture and manufacturing continue to play a minor\r\nrole in the economy, constrained by the limited availability of\r\ncultivable land and the shortage of domestic labor. Most staple foods\r\nmust be imported. In 1994, industry which consisted mainly of garment\r\nproduction, boat building, and handicrafts accounted for about 15% of\r\nGDP.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $423 million (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 5.8% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $1,620 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 21.5%\r\nindustry: 15.3%\r\nservices: 63.2% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 7.7% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 56,435 (1990 est.)\r\nby occupation: fishing industry and agriculture 25%, services 21%,\r\nmanufacturing and construction 21%, trade, restaurants, and hotels\r\n16%, transportation and communication 10%, other 7%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NEGL%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $88 million (excluding foreign grants)\r\nexpenditures: $141 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n(1995 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: fish processing, tourism, shipping, boat building, coconut\r\nprocessing, garments, woven mats, rope, handicrafts, coral and sand\r\nmining\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 6.3% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 18,000 kW (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 40 million kWh (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 163 kWh (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: coconuts, corn, sweet potatoes;

Economic activity is\r\nlargely confined to the riverine area irrigated by the Niger. About\r\n10% of the population is nomadic and some 80% of the labor force is\r\nengaged in farming and fishing. Industrial activity is concentrated on\r\nprocessing farm commodities. Mali is heavily dependent on foreign aid\r\nand vulnerable to fluctuations in world prices for cotton, its main\r\nexport. Nonetheless the government has successfully implemented an\r\nIMF-recommended structural adjustment program that is helping the\r\neconomy grow, diversify, and attract foreign investment. Mali's\r\nadherence to economic reform, and the 50% devaluation of the African\r\nFranc in January 1994, has pushed up economic growth. Several\r\nmultinational corporations increased gold mining operations in 1996\r\nand the government projects that Mali will become a major Sub-Saharan\r\ngold exporter in the next few years.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $5.8 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 5.2% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $600 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 49%\r\nindustry: 17%\r\nservices: 34% (1995)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 12.7% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 2.666 million (1986 est.)\r\nby occupation: agriculture 80%, services 19%, industry and commerce 1%\r\n(1981)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues : $730 million\r\nexpenditures: $770 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n(1997 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: minor local consumer goods production and food processing;\r\nconstruction;

Agricultural production is concentrated on small farms, and\r\nthe most important commercial crops are coconuts, tomatoes, melons,\r\nand breadfruit. Small-scale industry is limited to handicrafts, fish\r\nprocessing, and copra. The tourist industry is the primary source of\r\nforeign exchange, employs about 10% of the labor force, and remains\r\nthe best hope for future added income. The islands have few natural\r\nresources, and imports far exceed exports. The government is drafting\r\neconomic reforms designed to increase revenue and compensate for\r\nreductions in US Government grants - in 1994, the US Government\r\nprovided grants of $50 million, equal to 55% of the Marshall Islands'\r\nGDP. About 25% of the government's FY95/96 budget was devoted to debt\r\nrepayment. In 1996, efforts to stabilize the economy included a 27%\r\nreduction in the government's work force and a 10% cut in the budget.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $94 million (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 1.5% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $1,680 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 16%\r\nindustry: 14%\r\nservices : 70% (1994)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 4% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal : 4,800 (1986)\r\nby occupation: NA\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 16% (1991 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues : $67.2 million\r\nexpenditures: $79.6 million, including capital expenditures of $21.6\r\nmillion (FY94/95 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: copra, fish, tourism, craft items from shell, wood, and\r\npearls, offshore banking (embryonic)\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 16,000 kW (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 57 million kWh (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: NA kWh\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: coconuts, cacao, taro, breadfruit, fruits;\r\npigs, chickens\r\n\r\nExports:\r\ntotal value: $21.3 million (f.o.b., 1995 est.)\r\ncommodities: fish, coconut oil, live animals, trochus shells\r\npartners: US, Japan, Australia\r\n\r\nImports:\r\ntotal value: $69.9 million (c.i.f., 1995 est.)\r\ncommodities: foodstuffs, machinery and equipment, fuels, beverages and\r\ntobacco\r\npartners: US, Japan, Australia\r\n\r\nDebt - external: $170 million (1994)\r\n\r\nEconomic aid:\r\nrecipient: under the terms of the Compact of Free Association, the US\r\nis to provide approximately $40 million in aid annually\r\n\r\nCurrency: 1 United States dollar (US$) = 100 cents\r\n\r\nExchange rates: US currency is used\r\n\r\nFiscal year: 1 October - 30 September\r\n\r\n@Marshall Islands:Communications\r\n\r\nTelephones: 800 (1988 est.)\r\n\r\nTelephone system: telex services\r\ndomestic: islands interconnected by shortwave radiotelephone (used\r\nmostly for government purposes)\r\ninternational: satellite earth stations - 2 Intelsat (Pacific Ocean);\r\nUS Government satellite communications system on Kwajalein\r\n\r\nRadio broadcast stations: AM 1, FM 2, shortwave 1\r\n\r\nRadios: NA\r\n\r\nTelevision broadcast stations: 1\r\n\r\nTelevisions: NA\r\n\r\n@Marshall Islands:Transportation\r\n\r\nRailways: 0 km\r\n\r\nHighways:\r\ntotal : NA km\r\npaved: NA km\r\nunpaved: NA km\r\nnote: paved roads on major islands (Majuro, Kwajalein), otherwise\r\nstone-, coral-, or laterite-surfaced roads and tracks\r\n\r\nPorts and harbors: Majuro\r\n\r\nMerchant marine:\r\ntotal: 94 ships (1,000 GRT or over) totaling 4,040,788 GRT/6,780,092\r\nDWT\r\nships by type: bulk carrier 44, cargo 5, combination ore/oil 1,\r\ncontainer 21, oil tanker 21, refrigerated cargo 1, vehicle carrier 1\r\n(1996 est.)\r\n\r\nAirports: 16 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nAirports - with paved runways:\r\ntotal : 9\r\n1,524 to 2,437 m: 3\r\n914 to 1,523 m: 1\r\nunder 914 m: 5 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nAirports - with unpaved runways:\r\ntotal : 7\r\n914 to 1,523 m: 7 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nMilitary\r\n\r\nMilitary branches: no regular military forces (a coast guard may be\r\nestablished);

Agriculture accounts for about 6% of GDP\r\nand the small industrial sector for 11%. Sugar production has\r\ndeclined, with most of the sugarcane now used for the production of\r\nrum. Banana exports are increasing, going mostly to France. The bulk\r\nof meat, vegetable, and grain requirements must be imported,\r\ncontributing to a chronic trade deficit that requires large annual\r\ntransfers of aid from France. Tourism has become more important than\r\nagricultural exports as a source of foreign exchange. The majority of\r\nthe work force is employed in the service sector and in\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $3.95 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $10,000 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 6%\r\nindustry: 11%\r\nservices: 83% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 3.9% (1990)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 160,000\r\nby occupation: agriculture 10%, industry 17%, services 73% (1992)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 23.5% (1993)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $620 million\r\nexpenditures: $2.1 billion, including capital expenditures of $170\r\nmillion (1992)\r\n\r\nIndustries: construction, rum, cement, oil refining, sugar, tourism\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: NA kW\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: NA kWh\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: NA kWh\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: pineapples, avocados, bananas, flowers,\r\nvegetables, sugarcane for rum\r\n\r\nExports:\r\ntotal value: $220 million (f.o.b., 1994)\r\ncommodities: refined petroleum products, bananas, rum, pineapples\r\npartners: France 57%, Guadeloupe 31%, French Guiana (1991)\r\n\r\nImports:\r\ntotal value : $1.6 billion (c.i.f., 1994)\r\ncommodities: petroleum products, crude oil, foodstuffs, construction\r\nmaterials, vehicles, clothing and other consumer goods\r\npartners: France 62%, UK, Italy, Germany, Japan, US (1991)\r\n\r\nDebt - external: $180 million (1994)\r\n\r\nEconomic aid:\r\nrecipient: ODA, $NA\r\nnote: substantial annual French aid\r\n\r\nCurrency: 1 French franc (F) = 100 centimes\r\n\r\nExchange rates: French francs (F) per US$1 - 5.4169 (January 1997),\r\n5.1155 (1996), 4.9915 (1995), 5.5520 (1994), 5.6632 (1993), 5.2938\r\n(1992)\r\n\r\nFiscal year: calendar year\r\n\r\n@Martinique:Communications\r\n\r\nTelephones: 209,672 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nTelephone system: domestic facilities are adequate\r\ndomestic: NA\r\ninternational: microwave radio relay to Guadeloupe, Dominica, and\r\nSaint Lucia;

Mauritania has extensive\r\ndeposits of iron ore, which account for almost 50% of total exports.\r\nThe decline in world demand for this ore, however, has led to cutbacks\r\nin production. The nation's coastal waters are among the richest\r\nfishing areas in the world, but overexploitation by foreigners\r\nthreatens this key source of revenue. The country's first deepwater\r\nport opened near Nouakchott in 1986. In recent years, drought and\r\neconomic mismanagement have resulted in a substantial buildup of\r\nforeign debt. The government has begun the second stage of an economic\r\nreform program in consultation with the World Bank, the IMF, and major\r\ndonor countries. Short-term growth prospects are gloomy because of the\r\nheavy debt service burden, rapid population growth, and vulnerability\r\nto climatic conditions.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $2.8 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 6% (1995)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $1,200 (1995)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 25%\r\nindustry: 31%\r\nservices: 44% (1994)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 6.5% (1995)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 465,000 (1981 est.);

The Mexican economy enters 1997 in the midst of\r\nan economic recovery that began to pick up steam in mid-1996. After\r\nplummeting more than 6% in 1995 in the aftermath of the peso crisis,\r\neconomic activity in Mexico grew by an estimated 5.1% in 1996. Many\r\nprivate forecasters who had scoffed at the ZEDILLO administration's 3%\r\ngrowth target for 1996 are now projecting economic expansion of 4-5%\r\nfor 1997. Strong export growth continues to drive the economy; total\r\nexports were up roughly 16% in 1996 compared to 1995. By the end of\r\n1996, however, Mexican government statistics showed that increased\r\ndomestic consumption and investment spending were also beginning to\r\ncontribute to the recovery. Despite these positive economic trends,\r\nstructural problems and vulnerabilities remain. Low savings rates will\r\nkeep Mexico dependent on foreign capital; national savings as a share\r\nof GDP plunged from a peak of 25% in 1983 to less than 14% in 1994.\r\nAdditionally, Mexico City is still struggling to bail out a banking\r\nsector burdened with bad debts. Mexico's international trade continues\r\nto be highly dependent on the US market. The US/Mexico trade balance\r\nhas shifted over the last two years because of the peso's rapid\r\ndevaluation in late 1994, which made Mexican exports much more\r\nattractive. In 1995 and 1996, the US ran trade deficits with Mexico, a\r\nlarge turnaround from 1994's trade surplus of about $1.3 billion.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $777.3 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 5.1% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $8,100 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture : 8%\r\nindustry: 28%\r\nservices: 63% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 28% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 36.3 million (November 1996)\r\nby occupation: services 31.7%, agriculture, forestry, hunting, and\r\nfishing 28%, commerce 14.6%, manufacturing 11.1%, construction 8.4%,\r\ntransportation 4.7%, mining and quarrying 1.5%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 10% (1996 est.) plus considerable underemployment\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $73.8 billion\r\nexpenditures: $74 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA (1996\r\nest.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: food and beverages, tobacco, chemicals, iron and steel,\r\npetroleum, mining, textiles, clothing, motor vehicles, consumer\r\ndurables, tourism\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 11% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 40.502 million kW (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 142.344 billion kWh (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 1,206 kWh (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: corn, wheat, soybeans, rice, beans, cotton,\r\ncoffee, fruit, tomatoes;

As a result, the economy\r\ndepends heavily on agriculture, featuring fruits, vegetables, wine,\r\nand tobacco. Moldova must import all of its supplies of oil, coal, and\r\nnatural gas, largely from Russia. Energy shortages contributed to\r\nsharp production declines after the breakup of the Soviet Union in\r\n1991. The Moldovan Government has recently been making progress on an\r\nambitious economic reform agenda, and the IMF has called Moldova a\r\nmodel for the region. As part of its reform efforts, Moldova\r\nintroduced a stable convertible currency, freed all prices, stopped\r\nissuing preferential credits to state enterprises and backed their\r\nsteady privatization, removed export controls, and freed interest\r\nrates. With the election of President LUCINSCHI in December 1996, it\r\nis unclear how rapidly the reforms will be pushed.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $10.8 billion (1996 estimate\r\nextrapolated from World Bank estimate for 1994)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 1.5% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $2,400 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 48%\r\nindustry: 28%\r\nservices: 24% (1994)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 15% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 2.03 million (January 1994)\r\nby occupation: agriculture 39.5%, industry 12.0%, other 48.5% (1994)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 1.4% (includes only officially registered\r\nunemployed;

Mongolia's severe climate, scattered\r\npopulation, and wide expanses of unproductive land, however, have\r\nconstrained economic development. Economic activity traditionally has\r\nbeen based on agriculture and the breeding of livestock. In past years\r\nextensive mineral resources had been developed with Soviet support;\r\ntotal Soviet assistance at its height amounted to 30% of GDP. The\r\nmining and processing of coal, copper, molybdenum, tin, tungsten, and\r\ngold account for a large part of industrial production. The dramatic\r\ndrop in the price of copper which accounts for half of the country's\r\nexport earnings, has held back economic growth. The Mongolian\r\nleadership also has been soliciting support from international\r\nfinancial agencies and foreign investors. The economy, however, has\r\nstill not recovered from the loss of Soviet aid. The country continues\r\nto suffer substantial economic hardships, with one-fourth of the\r\npopulation below the poverty line.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $5.1 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 3% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $2,060 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 28%\r\nindustry: 35%\r\nservices: 37% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 53% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 1.115 million (mid-1993 est.)\r\nby occupation : primarily herding/agricultural\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 6% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $1.5 billion\r\nexpenditures : $1.3 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n(1995 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: copper, construction materials, mining (particularly\r\ncoal);

The island's main export is electronic components which are\r\nmainly shipped to the US. The agriculture sector is small; cabbages,\r\ncarrots, cucumbers, and onions are grown for the domestic market;\r\nadditionally, some hot peppers and live plants are exported to the US\r\nand Europe. Volcanic activity in late 1995 led to the repeated\r\nevacuation of Montserrat's capital, Plymouth, and deep ash from the\r\nvolcano destroyed much of the yearend crops. These disruptions,\r\ncompounded by hurricanes, caused production in 1995 to drop\r\nprecipitously. The likely slow recovery of tourism and the continued\r\ndanger of an eruption dimmed the prospects for rapid recovery in 1996.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $55.3 million (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: -2.9% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $4,360 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 4.8%\r\nindustry: 18.4%\r\nservices: 76.8% (1990 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 4% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 4,521 (1992)\r\nby occupation : community, social, and personal services 40.5%,\r\nconstruction 13.5%, trade, restaurants, and hotels 12.3%,\r\nmanufacturing 10.5%, agriculture, forestry, and fishing 8.8%, other\r\n14.4% (1983 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 6% (1995)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: NA\r\nexpenditures : NA\r\n\r\nIndustries: tourism, rum, textiles, electronic appliances\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: NA kW\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: NA kWh\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: NA kWh\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: cabbages, carrots, cucumbers, tomatoes,\r\nonions, peppers;

Since the early 1980s the government has pursued an\r\neconomic program toward these objectives with the support of the IMF,\r\nthe World Bank, and the Paris Club of creditors. The dirham is now\r\nfully convertible for current account transactions; reforms of the\r\nfinancial sector have been implemented; and 43 state enterprises have\r\nbeen privatized. Drought conditions in three of the last four years\r\nhave depressed activity in the key agricultural sector, holding down\r\nexports and contributing to a 7.5% contraction in real GDP in 1995.\r\nFavorable rainfall in 1996 nurtured a record wheat crop and\r\ncontributed to the 9% overall growth. Servicing the large external\r\ndebt, preparing the economy for freer trade with the European Union,\r\nand finding jobs for Morocco's youthful population remain long-term\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $97.6 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 9% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $3,260 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 21%\r\nindustry: 30%\r\nservices: 49% (1994)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 5% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 7.4 million\r\nby occupation: agriculture 50%, services 26%, industry 15%, other 9%\r\n(1985)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 20% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $10.4 billion\r\nexpenditures: $10.75 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n(1996 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: phosphate rock mining and processing, food processing,\r\nleather goods, textiles, construction, tourism\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 4.5% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 3.79 million kW (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 10.17 billion kWh (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 385 kWh (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: barley, wheat, citrus, wine, vegetables,\r\nolives;

Agricultural output is at\r\nonly 75% of its 1981 level, and grain has to be imported. Industry\r\noperates at only 20%-40% of capacity. Foreign assistance programs\r\nsupply the foreign exchange required to pay for imports of goods and\r\nservices. The peace accord, signed in October 1992, has improved\r\nMozambique's prospects. The restoration of electrical transmission\r\nlines to South Africa and the completion of a new transmission line to\r\nZimbabwe (permitting the giant Cahora Bassa hydropower plant to export\r\nlarge amounts of electricity), proposed construction of a natural gas\r\npipeline to South Africa, and reform of transportation services will\r\ngreatly improve foreign exchange receipts. The Mozambique and South\r\nAfrican governments are developing the Maputo corridor, linking the\r\nport of Maputo with Witbank, South Africa. In the past few years, more\r\nthan 500 state enterprises have been privatized, including the\r\ncountry's largest commercial bank and a number of sizable\r\nmanufacturing firms.

Few other resources exist, so most necessities must be\r\nimported, including fresh water from Australia. The rehabilitation of\r\nmined land and the replacement of income from phosphates are serious\r\nlong-term problems. Substantial amounts of phosphate income are\r\ninvested in trust funds to help cushion the transition. However,\r\ndividends from the trusts have declined sharply since 1990 and the\r\ngovernment has been borrowing heavily from the trusts to finance\r\nfiscal deficits. In an effort to stem further escalation of fiscal\r\nproblems, the FY96/97 budget calls for a freeze on government wages\r\nfor two years, a reduction of over-staffed public service departments,\r\ndrastic cutbacks in hiring new government staff, privatization of\r\nnumerous government agencies, and closure of some overseas consulates.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $100 million (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $10,000 (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: NA%\r\nindustry: NA%\r\nservices : NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: -3.6% (1993)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\nby occupation : employed in mining phosphates, public administration,\r\neducation, and transportation\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 0%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues : $23.4 million\r\nexpenditures: $64.8 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n(FY95/96)\r\n\r\nIndustries: phosphate mining, financial services, coconut products\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 13,250 kW (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 48 million kWh (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: NA kWh\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: coconuts predominate\r\n\r\nExports:\r\ntotal value: $25.3 million (f.o.b., 1991)\r\ncommodities: phosphates\r\npartners : Australia, NZ\r\n\r\nImports:\r\ntotal value: $21.1 million (c.i.f., 1991)\r\ncommodities: food, fuel, manufactures, building materials, machinery\r\npartners: Australia, UK, NZ, Japan\r\n\r\nDebt - external: $33.3 million\r\n\r\nEconomic aid:\r\nrecipient: ODA, $2.25 million from Australia (FY96/97 est.)\r\n\r\nCurrency: 1 Australian dollar ($A) = 100 cents\r\n\r\nExchange rates: Australian dollars ($A) per US$1 - 1.2835 (January\r\n1997), 1.2773 (1996), 1.3486 (1995), 1.3667 (1994), 1.4704 (1993),\r\n1.3600 (1992)\r\n\r\nFiscal year: 1 July - 30 June\r\n\r\n@Nauru:Communications\r\n\r\nTelephones: 2,000 (1989 est.)\r\n\r\nTelephone system: adequate local and international radiotelephone\r\ncommunications provided via Australian facilities\r\ndomestic: NA\r\ninternational: satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat (Pacific Ocean)\r\n\r\nRadio broadcast stations: AM 1, FM 0, shortwave 0\r\n\r\nRadios: 4,000 (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nTelevision broadcast stations: 1 (1991 est.)\r\n\r\nTelevisions: NA\r\n\r\n@Nauru:Transportation\r\n\r\nRailways:\r\ntotal: 3.9 km;

Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy,\r\nproviding a livelihood for over 80% of the population and accounting\r\nfor more than 40% of GDP. Industrial activity is limited, mainly\r\ninvolving the processing of agricultural produce including jute,\r\nsugarcane, tobacco, and grain. Production of textiles and carpets has\r\nexpanded recently and accounted for about 80% of foreign exchange\r\nearnings in the past two years. Apart from agricultural land and\r\nforests, exploitable natural resources are mica, hydropower, and\r\ntourism. Agricultural production is growing about 5% on average as\r\ncompared with annual population growth of 2.5%. Since May 1991, the\r\ngovernment has been moving forward with economic reforms particularly\r\nthose that encourage trade and foreign investment, e.g., by\r\neliminating business licenses and registration requirements in order\r\nto simplify investment procedures. The government has also been\r\ncutting expenditures by reducing subsidies, privatizing state\r\nindustries, and laying off civil servants. The government made some\r\nprogress in 1996, signing trade agreements with countries including\r\nIndia, and attracting substantial foreign investment in hydropower.\r\nProspects for foreign trade and investment in areas besides hydropower\r\nand tourism will continue to remain poor because of the small size of\r\nthe economy, its technological backwardness, its remoteness, and its\r\nlandlocked geographic location highly susceptible to natural disaster.\r\nThe international community provides funding for more than 60% of\r\nNepal's development budget and more than 30% of total budgetary\r\nexpenditures.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $26.5 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 2.9% (FY95/96 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $1,200 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 42%\r\nindustry: 22%\r\nservices: 36% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 9.2% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 9.2 million (1996 est.)\r\nby occupation: agriculture 90%, services 7%, industry 3%\r\nnote : severe lack of skilled labor\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%;

The government makes its presence felt,\r\nhowever, through many regulations, permit requirements, and welfare\r\nprograms affecting most aspects of economic activity. Industrial\r\nactivity features food-processing, oil-refining, and metalworking. The\r\nhighly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 4% of the labor\r\nforce but provides large surpluses for export and the domestic\r\nfood-processing industry. Indeed, the Netherlands ranks third\r\nworldwide in value of agricultural exports, behind the US and France.\r\nSharp cuts in subsidy and social security spending have been\r\naccompanied by sustained growth in output and employment. The Dutch\r\nwill almost certainly qualify for the first wave of countries entering\r\nthe Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in 1999.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $317.8 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 2.7% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $20,500 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 3%\r\nindustry: 26%\r\nservices: 71% (1993)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 2% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 6.4 million (1993)\r\nby occupation: services 73%, manufacturing and construction 23%,\r\nagriculture 4% (1994)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 6.5% (November 1996)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $107.2 billion\r\nexpenditures: $118.9 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n(1996 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: agroindustries, metal and engineering products, electrical\r\nmachinery and equipment, chemicals, petroleum, fishing, construction,\r\nmicroelectronics\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 2.9% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 18.65 million kW\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 78 billion kWh\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 5,140 kWh (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: grains, potatoes, sugar beets, fruits,\r\nvegetables;

This dynamic\r\ngrowth has boosted real incomes, broadened and deepened the\r\ntechnological capabilities of the industrial sector, and contained\r\ninflationary pressures. Business confidence strengthened in 1994, and\r\nexport demand picked up in the Asia-Pacific region, resulting in 6.2%\r\ngrowth.

Since March 1991, when President CHAMORRO launched an\r\nambitious economic stabilization program, Nicaragua has reduced\r\ninflation and obtained substantial economic aid from abroad. Annual\r\ninflation fell from more than 750% in 1991 to less than 5% in 1992.\r\nAfter rising again to an estimated 20% in 1993, the annual inflation\r\nrate dropped to roughly 11% in 1994-96. Economic growth rose sharply\r\nin 1995-96, thanks to surges in most export categories. The\r\ngovernment's efforts to liberalize trade include a December 1995\r\ndecision to stop requiring exporters to bring their foreign exchange\r\nearnings into Nicaragua. On the debt front, the Nicaraguan Government\r\nlaunched a successful debt buyback program in 1995, purchasing 73% of\r\nits $1.373 billion commercial debt inherited from previous\r\ngovernments. Progress also occurred on reducing bilateral debt in 1996\r\nas Nicaragua reached an agreement with Russia, reducing Nicaragua's\r\ndebt by $3.3 billion. Debt reduction agreements with Paris Club\r\ncreditors and rescheduling with Latin American creditors also took\r\nplace. Unemployment remains a pressing problem, however, with roughly\r\nhalf the country's work force unemployed or underemployed.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $7.7 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 5.5% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $1,800 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 34%\r\nindustry: 21%\r\nservices: 45% (1995)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 11% (1996)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal : 1.086 million\r\nby occupation: services 43%, agriculture 44%, industry 13% (1986)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 16%;

Terms of trade with\r\nNigeria, Niger's largest regional trade partner, have improved\r\ndramatically since the 50% devaluation of the African franc in January\r\n1994; this devaluation boosted exports of livestock, peas, onions, and\r\nthe products of Niger's small cotton industry. The government relies\r\non bilateral and multilateral aid for operating expenses and public\r\ninvestment and is strongly induced to adhere to structural adjustment\r\nprograms designed by the IMF and the World Bank.

Nigeria's unpopular military rulers have failed to make\r\nsignificant progress in diversifying the economy away from\r\noverdependence on the capital intensive oil sector which provides half\r\nof GDP, 95% of foreign exchange earnings, and about 80% of budgetary\r\nrevenues. Regime officials also appear divided on how to redress\r\nfundamental economic imbalances that result in troublesome inflation\r\nand the discouragement of investors. The government's resistance to\r\ninitiating greater transparency and accountability in managing the\r\ncountry's multibillion dollar oil earnings continues to limit economic\r\ngrowth and prevent an agreement with the IMF and bilateral creditors\r\non debt relief. The largely subsistence agricultural sector has failed\r\nto keep up with rapid population growth, and Nigeria, once a large net\r\nexporter of food, now must import food.

Government\r\nexpenditures regularly exceed revenues, with the shortfall made up by\r\ngrants from New Zealand - the grants are used to pay wages to public\r\nemployees. Niue has cut government expenditures in 1994-96, however,\r\nby reducing the public service by almost half. The agricultural sector\r\nconsists mainly of subsistence gardening, although some cash crops are\r\ngrown for export. Industry consists primarily of small factories to\r\nprocess passion fruit, lime oil, honey, and coconut cream. The sale of\r\npostage stamps to foreign collectors is an important source of\r\nrevenue. The island in recent years has suffered a serious loss of\r\npopulation because of migration of Niueans to New Zealand.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $2.4 million (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $1,200 (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: NA%\r\nindustry: NA%\r\nservices: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 5% (1992)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 1,000 (1981 est.)\r\nby occupation: most work on family plantations;

The rate of funding has declined as locally\r\ngenerated government revenues have grown. An agreement for the years\r\n1986 to 1992 entitled the islands to $228 million for capital\r\ndevelopment, government operations, and special programs. Since 1992,\r\nfunding has been extended one year at a time. The commonwealth\r\nreceived $27.7 million from FY93/94 through FY95/96. For FY96/97\r\nthrough FY02/03, funding of $11 million will be provided for\r\ninfrastructure, with an equal local match. A rapidly growing major\r\nsource of income is the tourist industry, which now employs about 50%\r\nof the work force. Japanese tourists predominate.

The economy consists of a combination of free market\r\nactivity and government intervention. The government controls key\r\nareas, such as the vital petroleum sector (through large-scale state\r\nenterprises), and extensively subsidizes agriculture, fishing, and\r\nareas with sparse resources. Norway maintains an extensive welfare\r\nsystem that helps propel public sector expenditures to more than 50%\r\nof GDP and results in one of the highest average tax levels in the\r\nworld (46%). A small country with a high dependence on international\r\ntrade, Norway is basically an exporter of raw materials and\r\nsemiprocessed goods, with an abundance of small- and medium-sized\r\nfirms, and is ranked among the major shipping nations. The country is\r\nrichly endowed with natural resources - petroleum, hydropower, fish,\r\nforests, and minerals - and is highly dependent on its oil sector.\r\nOnly Saudi Arabia exports more oil than Norway. Norway imports more\r\nthan half its food needs. Economic growth, only 1.6% in 1993, has\r\nimproved steadily over the past few years, resulting in a budget\r\nsurplus in 1996. Oslo opted to stay out of the EU during a referendum\r\nin November 1994. Despite their high per capita income - outstripped\r\namong major nations only by the US - and their generous welfare\r\nbenefits, the Norwegians worry about that time in the 21st century\r\nwhen the oil and gas run out.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $114.1 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 4.8% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $26,200 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 2.9%\r\nindustry: 34.7%\r\nservices : 62.4% (1991)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 1.2% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 2.13 million\r\nby occupation: services 71%, industry 23%, agriculture, forestry, and\r\nfishing 6% (1993)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 4.5% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $48.6 billion\r\nexpenditures: $53 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA (1994\r\nest.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: petroleum and gas, food processing, shipbuilding, pulp and\r\npaper products, metals, chemicals, timber, mining, textiles, fishing\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 3% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 26.43 million kW (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 123.2 billion kWh (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 24,586 kWh (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: oats, other grains;

the western Pacific is monsoonal - a rainy\r\nseason occurs during the summer months, when moisture-laden winds blow\r\nfrom the ocean over the land, and a dry season during the winter\r\nmonths, when dry winds blow from the Asian land mass back to the\r\nocean;

southern shipping lanes subject to icebergs from\r\nAntarctica; occasional El Nino phenomenon occurs off the coast of\r\nPeru, when the trade winds slacken and the warm Equatorial\r\nCountercurrent moves south, killing the plankton that is the primary\r\nfood source for anchovies; consequently, the anchovies move to better\r\nfeeding grounds, causing resident marine birds to starve by the\r\nthousands because of the loss of their food source; ships subject to\r\nsuperstructure icing in extreme north from October to May and in\r\nextreme south from May to October;

In 1985 over half (54%)\r\nof the world's fish catch came from the Pacific Ocean, which is the\r\nonly ocean where the fish catch has increased every year since 1978.\r\nExploitation of offshore oil and gas reserves is playing an\r\never-increasing role in the energy supplies of Australia, NZ, China,\r\nUS, and Peru. The high cost of recovering offshore oil and gas,\r\ncombined with the wide swings in world prices for oil since 1985, has\r\nslowed but not stopped new drillings.\r\n\r\n@Pacific Ocean:Communications\r\n\r\nTelephone system:\r\ninternational : several submarine cables with network nodal points on\r\nGuam and Hawaii\r\n\r\n@Pacific Ocean:Transportation\r\n\r\nPorts and harbors: Bangkok (Thailand), Hong Kong, Kao-hsiung (Taiwan),\r\nLos Angeles (US), Manila (Philippines), Pusan (South Korea), San\r\nFrancisco (US), Seattle (US), Shanghai (China), Singapore, Sydney\r\n(Australia), Vladivostok (Russia), Wellington (NZ), Yokohama (Japan)\r\n\r\nTransnational Issues\r\n\r\nDisputes - international: some maritime disputes (see littoral states)\r\n______________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nPAKISTAN\r\n\r\n@Pakistan:Geography\r\n\r\nLocation: Southern Asia, bordering the Arabian Sea, between India on\r\nthe east and Iran and Afghanistan on the west\r\n\r\nGeographic coordinates: 30 00 N, 70 00 E\r\n\r\nMap references: Asia\r\n\r\nArea:\r\ntotal : 803,940 sq km\r\nland: 778,720 sq km\r\nwater: 25,220 sq km\r\n\r\nArea - comparative: slightly less than twice the size of California\r\n\r\nLand boundaries:\r\ntotal: 6,774 km\r\nborder countries: Afghanistan 2,430 km, China 523 km, India 2,912 km,\r\nIran 909 km\r\n\r\nCoastline: 1,046 km\r\n\r\nMaritime claims:\r\ncontiguous zone: 24 nm\r\ncontinental shelf: 200 nm or to the edge of the continental margin\r\nexclusive economic zone: 200 nm\r\nterritorial sea: 12 nm\r\n\r\nClimate: mostly hot, dry desert; temperate in northwest; arctic in\r\nnorth\r\n\r\nTerrain: flat Indus plain in east; mountains in north and northwest;\r\nBalochistan plateau in west\r\n\r\nElevation extremes:\r\nlowest point: Indian Ocean 0 m\r\nhighest point: K2 (Mt.

Even though GDP\r\ngrowth has remained strong, at roughly 5% annually, international\r\nconfidence in Prime Minister Benazir BHUTTO's government declined in\r\n1996. The IMF suspended a Standby Agreement in the spring; foreign\r\ninvestment declined; and the budget and trade deficits rose\r\nsubstantially. In October 1996, BHUTTO responded to IMF pressure to\r\nimplement reforms, devaluing the rupee by about 8% and raising\r\npetroleum prices in an attempt to slow the drain on foreign exchange\r\nreserves. But Islamabad still failed to meet IMF revenue and borrowing\r\ntargets. Pakistan's interim government - in power since President\r\nLEGHARI sacked BHUTTO on 5 November 1996 - agreed to slash the budget\r\ndeficit, push down bank borrowing, implement an agricultural tax; and\r\nspeed up reforms in the financial sector; accordingly, the Standby\r\nAgreement was reinstated in December 1996 and a tranche of $80 million\r\nreleased; but Pakistan fell out of compliance in February 1997. For\r\nthe long run, Pakistan must deal with serious problems of\r\ndeteriorating infrastructure, low literacy levels, and persistent\r\nsectarian and political violence.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $296.5 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 5.5% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $2,300 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 24.8%\r\nindustry: 26.5%\r\nservices: 48.7% (1996)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 10.8% (FY95/96)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 36.7 million (1997)\r\nby occupation: agriculture 47%, mining and manufacturing 17%, services\r\n17%, other 19%\r\nnote : extensive export of labor, mostly to the Middle East, and use\r\nof child labor\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues : $12.5 billion\r\nexpenditures: $14 billion, including capital expenditures of $2.8\r\nbillion (FY95/96 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: textiles, food processing, beverages, construction\r\nmaterials, clothing, paper products, shrimp\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 6.1% (FY95/96 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 13.17 million kW (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 46.1 billion kWh (FY95/96)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 403 kWh (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: cotton, wheat, rice, sugarcane, fruits,\r\nvegetables;

Panama's former protectionist policies have taken their\r\ntoll, and the economy has been sluggish the last two years, with GDP\r\ngrowth at 1.9% in 1995 and 1.5% in 1996. Although tourism and the\r\nPanama Canal posted growth in 1996, most sectors remained stagnant,\r\nand some, like the Colon Free Zone, banana and shrimp exports, and\r\nconstruction, were down from 1995. Although the PEREZ BALLADARES\r\nadministration has advanced an economic reform program designed to\r\nliberalize the trade regime, attract foreign investment, privatize\r\nstate-owned enterprises, institute fiscal reform, and encourage\r\njob-creation through labor code reform, the positive effects of this\r\nprogram have not yet been felt at the macroeconomic level. In 1996,\r\nthe government concluded a Brady-type plan to restructure the\r\ncountry's commercial debt - one of the highest in the world in per\r\ncapita terms - allowing it to reenter international financial markets.\r\nPanama also completed all requirements to join the World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTrO) and is awaiting legislative ratification to become\r\na full member.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $14 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 1.5% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $5,300 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 10%\r\nindustry : 16%\r\nservices: 74% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 1.3% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal : 1.015 million (1996 est.)\r\nby occupation: government and community services 31.8%, agriculture,\r\nhunting, and fishing 26.8%, commerce, restaurants, and hotels 16.4%,\r\nmanufacturing and mining 9.4%, construction 3.2%, transportation and\r\ncommunications 6.2%, finance, insurance, and real estate 4.3%\r\nnote: shortage of skilled labor, but an oversupply of unskilled labor\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 14% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues : $1.86 billion\r\nexpenditures: $1.86 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n(1995)\r\n\r\nIndustries: construction, petroleum refining, brewing, cement and\r\nother construction materials, sugar milling\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 0.4% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 1.1405 billion kW (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 3.519 billion kWh (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 1,069 kWh (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: bananas, rice, corn, coffee, sugarcane,\r\nvegetables;

Agriculture\r\nprovides a subsistence livelihood for the bulk of the population.\r\nMineral deposits, including oil, copper, and gold, account for 72% of\r\nexport earnings. Budgetary support from Australia and development aid\r\nunder World Bank auspices have helped sustain the economy. In 1995,\r\nPort Moresby reached agreement with the IMF and World Bank on a\r\nstructural adjustment program, of which the first phase was\r\nsuccessfully completed in 1996. A second phase structural adjustment\r\nloan will be negotiated in 1997. The structural adjustment program\r\nincludes liberalization of trade and investment policies, sustainable\r\ndevelopment of the forestry sector, improvement of government planning\r\ncapacity and better delivery of public services.

The informal sector features both reexport of\r\nimported consumer goods (electronics, whiskeys, perfumes, cigarettes,\r\nand office equipment) to neighboring countries as well as by the\r\nactivities of thousands of microenterprises and urban street vendors.\r\nThe formal sector is largely oriented toward services, but a large\r\npercentage of the population derive their living from agricultural\r\nactivity, often on a subsistence basis. The formal economy has grown\r\nan average of 3% to 4% over the past five years. However, population\r\nhas increased at 3% a year over the same period, leaving per capita\r\nincome nearly stagnant. The WASMOSY government has continued to pursue\r\nits economic reform agenda - with mixed success - in close\r\ncoordination with its partners in Mercosur (Southern Cone Common\r\nMarket). Paraguay's ongoing integration into Mercosur offers potential\r\nfor investment and growth.

In the 1980s,\r\nthe economy suffered from hyperinflation, declining per capita output,\r\nand mounting external debt. Peru was shut off from IMF and World Bank\r\nsupport in the mid-1980s because of its huge debt arrears. An\r\nausterity program implemented shortly after the FUJIMORI government\r\ntook office in July 1990 contributed to a third consecutive yearly\r\ncontraction of economic activity, but the slide came to a halt late\r\nthat year, and in 1991 output rose 2.4%. After a burst of inflation as\r\nthe austerity program eliminated government price subsidies, monthly\r\nprice increases eased to the single-digit level and by December 1991\r\ndropped to the lowest increase since mid-1987. Lima obtained a\r\nfinancial rescue package from multilateral lenders in September 1991,\r\nalthough it faced $14 billion in arrears on its external debt. By\r\nworking with the IMF and World Bank on new financial conditions and\r\narrangements, the government succeeded in ending its arrears by March\r\n1993. In 1992, GDP fell by 2.8%, in part because a warmer-than-usual\r\nEl Nino current resulted in a 30% drop in the fish catch, but the\r\neconomy rebounded as strong foreign investment helped push growth to\r\n7% in 1993, about 13% in 1994, and 6.8% in 1995. Growth slowed to\r\nabout 2.8% in 1996 as the government adopted tight fiscal and monetary\r\npolicy to reduce the current account deficit and meet its IMF targets.\r\nCapital inflows surged to record levels in early 1997 despite the MRTA\r\nhostage crisis.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $92 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 2.8% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $3,800 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 13%\r\nindustry: 42%\r\nservices: 45% (1994)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 11.5% (1996)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 7.6 million (1996 est.)\r\nby occupation: agriculture, mining and quarrying, manufacturing,\r\nconstruction, transport, services\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 8.2%;

The transition began on\r\n1 January 1990, when the new democratic government instituted shock\r\ntherapy by decontrolling prices, slashing subsidies, and drastically\r\nreducing import barriers. Although real GDP fell sharply in 1990 and\r\n1991, in 1992 Poland became the first country in the region to resume\r\neconomic growth with a 2.6% increase. Growth advanced to 3.8% in 1993,\r\n5.2% in 1994, 6.5% in 1995, and 6.0% in 1996. Most of the growth since\r\n1991 has come from the booming private sector, which now accounts for\r\nmore than 60% of GDP, attributable mostly to the creation of new\r\nprivate firms. Large-scale industry still remains largely in state\r\nhands. The trade and current account balances officially are in\r\ndeficit but in fact both have comfortable surpluses because of large,\r\nunrecorded sales to cross-border visitors.

The Socialist\r\ngovernment's primary economic goal is to place Portugal in the first\r\ngroup of countries adopting the single European currency, and it has\r\ninstituted a disciplined 1997 budget to bolster Lisbon's chances.\r\nPortuguese government forecasts suggest that it is likely to meet\r\npartially the Maastricht monetary convergence criteria by lowering its\r\nbudget deficit from 4% of GDP in 1996 to 2.9% in 1997, although the\r\ngovernment predicts that government debt will be cut only to 68% of\r\nGDP, overshooting Maastricht's 60% target. Social programs - a\r\npriority for the Socialists - will still grow slightly faster than GDP\r\nin 1997, mandating strict budget discipline in other areas. As for the\r\nlong run, Portugal is increasing its infrastructure spending - much of\r\nit in anticipation of hosting the world's International Exposition in\r\n1998 - while working to modernize its capital plant and increase\r\ncompetitiveness in hopes of increasing Portugal's GDP, which remains\r\nbelow 65% of the EU's average GDP per capita.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $122.1 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 2.5% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $12,400 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture : 6%\r\nindustry: 36%\r\nservices: 58% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 3.4% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 4.53 million (1996 est.)\r\nby occupation : services 54.5%, manufacturing 24.4%, agriculture,\r\nforestry, fisheries 11.2%, construction 8.3%, utilities 1.0%, mining\r\n0.5% (1992)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 7% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $48 billion\r\nexpenditures: $52 billion, including capital expenditures of $7.4\r\nbillion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: textiles and footwear;

Sugarcane has been the primary crop for more than a\r\ncentury, and in some years it accounts for 85% of exports. The\r\ngovernment has been pushing the development of a tourist industry to\r\nrelieve high unemployment, which recently amounted to one-third of the\r\nlabor force. The gap in Reunion between the well-off and the poor is\r\nextraordinary and accounts for the persistent social tensions. The\r\nwhite and Indian communities are substantially better off than other\r\nsegments of the population, often approaching European standards,\r\nwhereas indigenous groups suffer the poverty and unemployment typical\r\nof the poorer nations of the African continent. The outbreak of severe\r\nrioting in February 1991 illustrates the seriousness of socioeconomic\r\ntensions. The economic well-being of Reunion depends heavily on\r\ncontinued financial assistance from France.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $2.9 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 2.7% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $4,300 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: NA%\r\nindustry : NA%\r\nservices: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: NA%\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 242,169 (1993)\r\nby occupation: agriculture 30%, industry 21%, services 49% (1981)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 35% (1994)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $NA\r\nexpenditures: $NA\r\n\r\nIndustries: sugar, rum, cigarettes, handicraft items\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: NA kW\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 1.09 billion kWh (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 1,670 kWh (1994)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: sugarcane, vanilla, tobacco, tropical fruits,\r\nvegetables, corn\r\n\r\nExports:\r\ntotal value: $171.776 million (f.o.b., 1994)\r\ncommodities: sugar 63%, rum and molasses 4%, perfume essences 2%,\r\nlobster 3%, (1993)\r\npartners: France, Mauritius, Bahrain, South Africa, Italy, Madagascar\r\n\r\nImports:\r\ntotal value: $2.354 billion (c.i.f., 1994)\r\ncommodities : manufactured goods, food, beverages, tobacco, machinery\r\nand transportation equipment, raw materials, and petroleum products\r\npartners: France, Mauritius, Bahrain, South Africa, Italy, Madagascar\r\n\r\nDebt - external: $NA\r\n\r\nEconomic aid:\r\nrecipient: substantial annual subsidies from France\r\n\r\nCurrency: 1 French franc (F) = 100 centimes\r\n\r\nExchange rates: French francs (F) per US$1 - 5.4169 (January 1997),\r\n5.1155 (1996), 4.9915 (1995), 5.5520 (1994), 5.6632 (1993), 5.2938\r\n(1992)\r\n\r\nFiscal year: calendar year\r\n\r\n@Reunion:Communications\r\n\r\nTelephones: 191,647 (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nTelephone system: adequate system;

Over the past seven years, economic restructuring has\r\nlagged behind most other countries in the region. Consequently,\r\neconomic performance is declining, with slowing GDP growth, ballooning\r\nbudget deficits, accelerating inflation, a plunging exchange rate, and\r\nanemic foreign investment. Unemployment was low at about 6% at the end\r\nof 1996, but the rate will rise when restructuring gets underway. A\r\nnew government elected in November 1996 promises to accelerate\r\neconomic reform, restructuring, and privatization, introduce fiscal\r\nand monetary austerity, reduce the state's role in the economy, and\r\nopen Romania to foreign investment. The government will tackle its\r\nformidable economic problems in two stages, with an emergency plan\r\nover the winter of 1996/97 to ensure social and political stability,\r\nfollowed by a radical structural reform program over its remaining\r\nthree-and-one-half years aimed eventually at EU accession. At the same\r\ntime, it wants to keep campaign promises to increase benefits to\r\ndisadvantaged groups. Bucharest hopes to receive financial and\r\ntechnical assistance from international financial institutions and\r\nwestern governments and negotiations over a new IMF standby agreement\r\nare underway. If reform stalls, however, Romania's bond rating - just\r\nbelow investment grade - could fall and needed capital from both\r\npublic and private sources could quickly dry up. Rich agricultural and\r\noil resources are strengths for the future.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $113.2 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 4.1% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $5,200 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 20%\r\nindustry: 33.4%\r\nservices: 46.6% (1995)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 56.9% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal : 10.1 million (1996 est.)\r\nby occupation: industry 28.8%, agriculture 36.4%, other 34.8% (1994)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 6.1% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $6 billion\r\nexpenditures: $7.3 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n(1996 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: mining, timber, construction materials, metallurgy,\r\nchemicals, machine building, food processing, petroleum production and\r\nrefining\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 7% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 22.06 million kW (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 52.48 billion kWh (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 2,245 kWh (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: wheat, corn, sugar beets, sunflower seed,\r\npotatoes, grapes;

Most of 1996 was a lost year for economic reforms, with\r\ngovernment officials focused in the first half of the year on\r\nPresident YEL'TSIN's reelection and then on his medical problems. The\r\nonly major success was in the fight against inflation, which fell from\r\n131% in 1995 to 22% in 1996. Russia failed to make any progress in\r\nrestructuring its social welfare programs to target the most needy -\r\namong whom are many of the old pensioners - or to pass needed tax\r\nreform. While approximately 75% of industry has now been privatized,\r\nthe agricultural sector has undergone little reform since the break-up\r\nof the Soviet Union. Stockholder rights remain weak while crime and\r\ncorruption are rampant in much of the economy. Many enterprises\r\ncontinue to operate without hard budget constraints, resulting in\r\nbarter trade and increased inter-enterprise debts. According to\r\nofficial statistics, the Russian economy declined for the fifth\r\nstraight year since the beginning of reforms, with GDP in 1996 falling\r\nby 6% and industrial output by 5%. The true size of the Russian\r\neconomy remains controversial, however, with estimates of unreported\r\neconomic activity ranging from 20%-50% of GDP. Indeed, according to\r\nRussian statistics, the Russian consumer has seen a small improvement\r\nin the last several years, with real average incomes growing by about\r\n8% from early 1993 to late 1996. The share of the Russian population\r\nliving below the poverty line is said to have dropped from one-third\r\nin early 1993 to one-fifth in late 1996. Few Russians lack basic\r\nnecessities, and ownership of consumer goods such as VCRs and\r\nautomobiles has increased markedly. The growth of wage and pension\r\narrears slowed in the second half of 1996, and the government pledged\r\nto clear all budget-funded wage and pension arrears by the end of\r\n1997. The government continued to be plagued with tax collection\r\nproblems during 1996, forcing it to cut its planned spending by 18%. A\r\ncrackdown on major tax debtors at the end of the year had only limited\r\nsuccess. Spending by all levels of government remains high, between\r\n40%-45% of GDP. The economy is continuing its integration into world\r\nmarkets. Russia's trade surplus, after adjustment for unreported\r\n\"shuttle\" trade, grew to a record $28.5 billion in 1996, according to\r\nofficial Russian statistics. Export growth, which slowed from 18% to\r\n9%, was due mostly to increased raw material prices. After increasing\r\nby 15% in 1995, imports dipped by 2% in 1996 as Russian demand for\r\nWestern consumer goods slackened. Russia is continuing to make\r\nprogress in its WTrO negotiations; the government has made quick\r\naccession one of its major policy goals. The continued unsettled\r\neconomic and political situation has discouraged foreign investment,\r\nwhich totaled only $6.5 billion in 1996, including $2.1 billion in\r\ndirect investment; furthermore, capital flight continues to exceed in\r\nvolume the inflow of foreign capital. The central bank estimates that\r\n$30 billion in US currency circulates in the Russian economy. In March\r\n1997, YEL'TSIN signaled his intention to restart stalled economic\r\nreforms by reorganizing the cabinet, bringing in a new team of\r\nministers with strong reform credentials.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $767 billion (1996 estimate as\r\nextrapolated from World Bank estimate for 1994)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: -6% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $5,200 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: NA%\r\nindustry: NA%\r\nservices: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 22% (1996)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 73 million (1996)\r\nby occupation : NA\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 9.3% (December 1996) (according to ILO definition)\r\nwith considerable additional underemployment\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues : $NA\r\nexpenditures: $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n\r\nIndustries: complete range of mining and extractive industries\r\nproducing coal, oil, gas, chemicals, and metals;

The agricultural sector dominates the\r\neconomy; coffee and tea normally make up 80%-90% of exports. The\r\namount of fertile land is limited, however, and deforestation and soil\r\nerosion continue to reduce the production potential. Manufacturing\r\nfocuses mainly on the processing of agricultural products. A\r\nstructural adjustment program with the World Bank began in October\r\n1990. Ethnic-based insurgency since 1990 has devastated wide areas,\r\nespecially in the north, and displaced hundreds of thousands of\r\npeople. A peace accord in mid-1993 temporarily ended most of the\r\nfighting, but resumption of large-scale civil warfare in April 1994 in\r\nthe capital city Kigali and elsewhere took 500,000 lives in that year\r\nalone and severely damaged already poor economic prospects. Sketchy\r\ndata suggest that GDP dropped 50% in 1994 and came back partially, by\r\n25%, in 1995. Plentiful rains helped agriculture in 1996, and outside\r\naid continued to support this desperately poor economy. The economy\r\ncontinues to suffer massively from failure to maintain the\r\ninfrastructure, looting, neglect of important cash crops, and lack of\r\nhealth care facilities. Because of the accumulated damage to capital\r\nplant and the decline in public discipline, recovery of domestic\r\nproduction will proceed slowly.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $3.8 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $400 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture : 52%\r\nindustry: 13%\r\nservices: 35% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 22% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 3.6 million\r\nby occupation: agriculture 93%, government and services 5%, industry\r\nand commerce 2%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $NA\r\nexpenditures: $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n\r\nIndustries: mining of cassiterite (tin ore) and wolframite (tungsten\r\nore), tin, cement, processing of agricultural products, small-scale\r\nbeverage production, soap, furniture, shoes, plastic goods, textiles,\r\ncigarettes\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 60,000 kW\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 190 million kWh\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 23 kWh (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: coffee, tea, pyrethrum (insecticide made from\r\nchrysanthemums), bananas, beans, sorghum, potatoes;

About 40% of GDP\r\ncomes from the private sector. Economic (as well as political) ties\r\nwith the US are especially strong. The petroleum sector accounts for\r\nroughly 75% of budget revenues, 35% of GDP, and 90% of export\r\nearnings. Saudi Arabia has the largest reserves of petroleum in the\r\nworld (26% of the proved total), ranks as the largest exporter of\r\npetroleum, and plays a leading role in OPEC. For the 1990s the\r\ngovernment intends to bring its budget, which has been in deficit\r\nsince 1983, back into balance, and to encourage private economic\r\nactivity. Roughly four million foreign workers play an important role\r\nin the Saudi economy, for example, in the oil and service sectors. For\r\nover a decade, Saudi Arabia's domestic and international outlays have\r\noutstripped its income, and the government has cut its foreign\r\nassistance and is beginning to rein in domestic programs. A\r\nsubstantial rise in oil prices was the key to a successful 1996. For\r\n1997, the country looks to its policies of maintaining moderate fiscal\r\nreforms, restraining public spending, and encouraging non-oil exports.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $205.6 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 6% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $10,600 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture : 9%\r\nindustry: 50%\r\nservices: 41% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 1% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 6 million-7 million\r\nby occupation: government 40%, industry, construction, and oil 25%,\r\nservices 30%, agriculture 5%\r\nnote: 35.87% of the population in the 15-64 age group is non-national\r\n(July 1997 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 6.5% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues : $43.7 billion\r\nexpenditures: $48.3 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n(1997 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: crude oil production, petroleum refining, basic\r\npetrochemicals, cement, two small steel-rolling mills, construction,\r\nfertilizer, plastics\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 17% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 20.9 million kW (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 62.75 billion kWh (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 3,228 kWh (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: wheat, barley, tomatoes, melons, dates,\r\ncitrus;

After years of foot-dragging, the government\r\npassed a liberalized labor code which should lower the cost of labor\r\nand improve the manufacturing sector's competitiveness. Inroads also\r\nhave been made in closing tax loopholes, eliminating monopoly power in\r\nseveral sectors, and privatizing state-owned firms. At the same time,\r\nthe government is holding the line on current fiscal expenditure under\r\nthe watchful eyes of international organizations on which it depends\r\nfor substantial support. The IMF, in mid-1995, announced that the\r\ngovernment met most economic targets as called for in its Enhanced\r\nStructural Adjustment Facility agreement and released the second $50\r\nmillion tranche. The country's narrow tax and resource base,\r\nenvironmental degradation, and untamed growth of the population will\r\ncontinue to hold back improvement in living standards over the medium\r\nterm.

Output in Serbia and Montenegro dropped by\r\nhalf in 1992-93. Like the other former Yugoslav republics, it had\r\ndepended on its sister republics for large amounts of energy and\r\nmanufactures. Wide differences in climate, mineral resources, and\r\nlevels of technology among the republics accentuated this\r\ninterdependence, as did the communist practice of concentrating much\r\nindustrial output in a small number of giant plants. The breakup of\r\nmany of the trade links, the sharp drop in output as industrial plants\r\nlost suppliers and markets, and the destruction of physical assets in\r\nthe fighting all have contributed to the economic difficulties of the\r\nrepublics. One singular factor in the economic situation of Serbia and\r\nMontenegro is the continuation in office of a communist government\r\nthat is primarily interested in political and military mastery, not\r\neconomic reform.

In recent years the government has encouraged foreign\r\ninvestment in order to upgrade hotels and other services. At the same\r\ntime, the government has moved to reduce the dependence on tourism by\r\npromoting the development of farming, fishing, and small-scale\r\nmanufacturing. The vulnerability of the tourist sector was illustrated\r\nby the sharp drop in 1991-92 due largely to the Gulf war. Although the\r\nindustry has rebounded, the government recognizes the continuing need\r\nfor upgrading the sector in the face of stiff international\r\ncompetition.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $450 million (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 1.1% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $6,000 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture : 3.6%\r\nindustry: 15%\r\nservices: 81.4% (1994)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: -0.3% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 26,000 (1996)\r\nby occupation: industry and commerce 31%, services 21%, government\r\n20%, agriculture, forestry, and fishing 12%, other 16% (1985)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $220 million\r\nexpenditures: $241 million, including capital expenditures of $36\r\nmillion (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: tourism;

However, the economic and social\r\ninfrastructure is not well developed, and serious social disorders\r\ncontinue to hamper economic development. Agriculture employs about\r\ntwo-thirds of the working population, with subsistence agriculture\r\ndominating the sector. Manufacturing consists mainly of the processing\r\nof raw materials and of light manufacturing for the domestic market.\r\nThe mining of diamonds, bauxite, and rutile is the major source of\r\nhard currency. The government has worked hard to meet its IMF- and\r\nWorld Bank-mandated stabilization targets, holding down fiscal\r\ndeficits and retiring much of its domestic debt, but at a steep cost\r\nin terms of forgone capital investments and social spending. Moreover,\r\nthe economic infrastructure has nearly collapsed due to neglect and\r\nwar-related disruptions in the mining and agricultural export sectors.\r\nThe continuing civil war in Liberia has led to a large influx of\r\nrefugees, who place additional burdens on Sierra Leone's fragile\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $4.7 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 5% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $980 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 49%\r\nindustry: 21%\r\nservices: 30% (1995)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 5.6% (1996)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 1.369 million (1981 est.)\r\nby occupation: agriculture 65%, industry 19%, services 16% (1981 est.)\r\nnote: only about 65,000 wage earners (1985)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues : $75 million\r\nexpenditures: $128 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n(FY94/95 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: mining (diamonds, bauxite, rutile);

Macroeconomic performance improved steadily in 1994-96, but\r\nprivatization progressed only in fits and starts. Strong export\r\nperformance boosted GDP growth to 4.8% in 1994 after a four-year\r\ndecline. GDP surged to 7.4% growth in 1995 and should be only slightly\r\nless in 1996, the fastest growth in Central and Eastern Europe.\r\nUnemployment fell to about 12% in 1996 and inflation dropped from 26%\r\nin 1993 to 5.5% in 1996, the lowest in the region. Foreign debt of\r\n$4.6 billion also is the lowest in the region and the second lowest\r\nper capita. Private activity now makes up roughly two-thirds of GDP.\r\nPositive international financial performance has led Standard & Poor's\r\nto raise its rating of the National Bank of Slovakia's foreign\r\ncurrency debt to just one step below investment grade. Although Slovak\r\neconomic performance continues to be impressive, many warning signs of\r\npossible danger ahead have been raised. Aggregate demand has surged in\r\nthe form of increased personal and government consumption. At the same\r\ntime that the budget deficit is growing, the money supply has been\r\nrapidly increasing, which could apply upward pressure on inflation.\r\nThe trade and current account deficits both are mounting as imports\r\nsoar and exports sag. Perhaps most troubling, Slovakia continues to\r\nhave difficulty attracting foreign investment because of perceived\r\npolitical problems and halting progress on restructuring and\r\nprivatization. The government projects 6.4% growth in 1997 and 5% in\r\n1998. Continuing economic recovery in western Europe should boost\r\nexports and production, but Slovakia's image with foreign creditors\r\nand investors could suffer setbacks in 1997 if progress on\r\nprivatization and restructuring stalls.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $42.8 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 7% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $8,000 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 5.4%\r\nindustry: 39.9%\r\nservices: 54.7% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 5.5% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 2.538 million\r\nby occupation : industry 29.3%, agriculture 8.9%, construction 8.0%,\r\ntransport and communication 8.2%, services 45.6% (1994)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 12% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $5.3 billion\r\nexpenditures : $5.6 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n(1995)\r\n\r\nIndustries: metal and metal products;

Its per capita GDP is now the highest in Central and Eastern\r\nEurope and comparable to the levels in the poorer West European\r\ncountries. Slovenia has benefited from strong ties to Western Europe\r\nand suffered comparatively small physical damage during Yugoslavia's\r\nbreakup. The beginning was difficult, however. Real GDP fell 15% in\r\n1991-92, while inflation soared to 200% in 1992. The turning point\r\ncame in 1993, when real GDP grew 1%, unemployment leveled off, and\r\ninflation slowed dramatically. In 1994, real GDP rose 5.5%, tapering\r\noff to an estimated 3.5% in 1995 and an estimated 3% in 1996. The\r\ngovernment gets good marks from foreign observers for fiscal policy -\r\nthe budget deficit has not exceeded 1% of GDP in any year since 1991,\r\nand the current account balance has remained in surplus throughout the\r\ntransition period, with the exception of 1995-96. The Slovene\r\nprivatization program, which began in 1994, involves about 1,400\r\nfirms, but less than half have been privatized. Growth in the near\r\nterm depends largely on economic revitalization in Western Europe\r\nwhich buys 70% of Slovenia's exports. Slovenia itself must press on\r\nwith privatization, restructuring, the encouragement of foreign\r\ninvestment, and the maintenance of a stable tolar.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $24 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 3% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $12,300 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 4.8%\r\nindustry: 33.2%\r\nservices : 62% (1996)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 8.8% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal : 857,400\r\nby occupation: NA%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 13% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues : $8.48 billion\r\nexpenditures: $8.53 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n(1996 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: ferrous metallurgy and rolling mill products, aluminum\r\nreduction and rolled products, lead and zinc smelting, electronics\r\n(including military electronics), trucks, electric power equipment,\r\nwood products, textiles, chemicals, machine tools\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: -1% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 2.361 million kW (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 12 billion kWh (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 5,362 kWh (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: potatoes, hops, wheat, sugar beets, corn,\r\ngrapes;

Moreover, much of the economy\r\nhas been devastated by the civil war. Agriculture is the most\r\nimportant sector, with livestock accounting for about 40% of GDP and\r\nabout 65% of export earnings. Nomads and seminomads, who are dependent\r\nupon livestock for their livelihood, make up a large portion of the\r\npopulation. Crop production generates only 10% of GDP and employs\r\nabout 20% of the work force. The main export crop is bananas; sugar,\r\nsorghum, and corn are grown for the domestic market. The small\r\nindustrial sector is based on the processing of agricultural products\r\nand accounts for less than 10% of GDP; most facilities have been shut\r\ndown because of the civil strife. The greatly increased political\r\nturmoil of 1991-93 resulted in a substantial drop in agricultural\r\noutput, with widespread famine. In 1994 economic conditions stabilized\r\nin the countryside, followed in 1995 by slight improvements. However,\r\nongoing civil strife in Mogadishu and outlying areas is interfering\r\nwith any substantial recovery.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $3.6 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 2% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $500 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture : 65.5%\r\nindustry: 8.7%\r\nservices: 25.8% (1990 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: NA\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 3.7 million (very few are skilled laborers)(1993 est.)\r\nby occupation: agriculture (mostly pastoral nomadism) 71%, industry\r\nand services 29%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $NA\r\nexpenditures: $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n\r\nIndustries: a few small industries, including sugar refining,\r\ntextiles, petroleum refining (mostly shut down)\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 144,000 kW prior to the civil war, but now\r\nlargely shut down due to war damage; some localities operate their own\r\ngenerating plants, providing limited municipal power; note - UN and\r\nrelief organizations use their own portable power systems\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 60 million kWh (1991)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: NA kWh\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: bananas, sorghum, corn, mangoes, sugarcane;\r\ncattle, sheep, goats; fishing potential largely unexploited\r\n\r\nExports:\r\ntotal value: $130 million (1994 est.)\r\ncommodities: bananas, live animals, fish, hides (1995)\r\npartners: Saudi Arabia 57%, Yemen 14%, Italy 13%, US (bananas) (1995\r\nest.)\r\n\r\nImports:\r\ntotal value: $269 million (1994 est.)\r\ncommodities : manufactures, petroleum products, foodstuffs,\r\nconstruction materials (1995)\r\npartners: Kenya 24%, Djibouti 18%, Pakistan 6% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nDebt - external: $2.6 billion (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nEconomic aid:\r\nrecipient: ODA, $NA\r\n\r\nCurrency: 1 Somali shilling (So.

Many of the white one-seventh of the South African\r\npopulation enjoy incomes, material comforts, and health and\r\neducational standards equal to those of Western Europe. In contrast,\r\nmost of the remaining population suffers from the poverty patterns of\r\nthe Third World, including unemployment, lack of job skills, and bleak\r\nliving conditions. The main strength of the economy lies in its rich\r\nmineral resources, which provide two-thirds of exports. Economic\r\ndevelopments for the remainder of the 1990s will be driven largely by\r\nthe new government's attempts to improve black living standards, to\r\nset the country on a steady export-led growth path, and to cut back\r\nthe enormous numbers of unemployed. The economy in recent years has\r\nabsorbed less than 5% of the more than 300,000 workers entering the\r\nlabor force annually. Local economists estimate that the economy must\r\ngrow at least 5% in real terms annually to absorb all of the new\r\nentrants, much less reduce the accumulated total.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $227 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 3% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $5,400 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture : 5%\r\nindustry: 37%\r\nservices : 58% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 9% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 14.2 million economically active (1996)\r\nby occupation: services 35%, agriculture 30%, industry 20%, mining 9%,\r\nother 6%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 34% (1996 est.);

Its\r\ncenter-right government has staked much on gaining admission to the\r\nfirst group of countries to implement the European single currency by\r\ndeveloping an austere 1997 budget - including a wage freeze for\r\npublic-sector employees - in hopes of meeting the Maastricht monetary\r\nconvergence criteria. The government slashed spending by $1.6 billion\r\nin mid-1996 to ensure that Spain's deficit did not exceed its target\r\nof 4.4% of GDP for the year; the government forecasts a deficit of 3%\r\nfor 1997. The AZNAR administration advocates liberalization,\r\nprivatization, and deregulation of the economy, and has introduced\r\nsome tax reforms to that end. Unemployment, nevertheless, remains the\r\nhighest in the EU at about 22%, but the government, for political\r\nreasons, has made only limited progress in changing labor laws or\r\nreforming pension schemes, which are key to the sustainability of\r\nSpain's economic advances.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $593 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 2.4% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $15,300 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 3.6%\r\nindustry: 33.6%\r\nservices: 62.8% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 3.7% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 12.475 million\r\nby occupation: services 62%, manufacturing, mining, and construction\r\n29%, agriculture 9% (1996)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 22% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $113 billion\r\nexpenditures : $139 billion, including capital expenditures of $15\r\nbillion (1995)\r\n\r\nIndustries: textiles and apparel (including footwear), food and\r\nbeverages, metals and metal manufactures, chemicals, shipbuilding,\r\nautomobiles, machine tools, tourism\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 5% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 39.58 million kW (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 163.7 billion kWh (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 3,752 kWh (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: grain, vegetables, olives, wine grapes, sugar\r\nbeets, citrus;

The economy has been plagued by high rates of unemployment\r\nsince the late 1970s. Economic growth accelerated in 1991-95 as\r\ndomestic conditions began to improve and conditions for foreign\r\ninvestment brightened. In 1996, however, a drought, slow economic\r\nreform, and civil war exacted a heavy economic toll. Insufficient\r\nmonsoon rains caused power cuts that hurt industrial and agricultural\r\nproduction, and the stepped-up Tamil insurgency reduced foreign\r\ninvestment and tourism - two key sources of foreign exchange.\r\nMeanwhile, Colombo's counterinsurgency efforts caused defense\r\nexpenditures to overshoot budget targets by 42%. In 1997, agricultural\r\nproduction should recover from the effects of last year's drought, but\r\nindustry will still be hampered by high real interest rates, slow\r\nimprovement in foreign investment inflows, and stalled progress on\r\nprivatization. The government's main challenge this year will be to\r\ncurb defense and social welfare spending to cut the budget deficit as\r\na percentage of GDP in half by 1998, as stipulated in its deficit\r\nreduction program.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $69.7 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 3.7% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $3,760 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 23.8%\r\nindustry: 24.7%\r\nservices : 51.5% (1994)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 15.9% (1996)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 6.2 million (1994)\r\nby occupation: agriculture 42%, services 40%, industry 18% (1994)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 13.1% (1994)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues : $3 billion\r\nexpenditures: $4.2 billion, including capital expenditures of $1\r\nbillion (1997)\r\n\r\nIndustries: processing of rubber, tea, coconuts, and other\r\nagricultural commodities;

The private\r\nsector's main areas of activity are agriculture and trading, with most\r\nprivate industrial investment predating 1980. Agriculture employs 80%\r\nof the work force. Industry mainly processes agricultural items.\r\nSluggish economic performance over the past decade, attributable\r\nlargely to declining annual rainfall, has kept per capita income at\r\nlow levels. A large foreign debt and huge arrearages continue to cause\r\ndifficulties. In 1990 the International Monetary Fund took the unusual\r\nstep of declaring Sudan noncooperative because of its nonpayment of\r\narrearages to the Fund. After Sudan backtracked on promised reforms in\r\n1992-93, the IMF threatened to expel Sudan from the Fund. To avoid\r\nexpulsion, Khartoum agreed to make payments on its arrears to the\r\nFund, liberalize exchange rates, and reduce subsidies, measures it has\r\npartially implemented. The government's continued prosecution of the\r\ncivil war and its growing international isolation continued to inhibit\r\ngrowth in the nonagricultural sectors of the economy during 1996.\r\nHyperinflation has raised consumer prices above the reach of most.\r\nPopular unrest erupted several times in 1996 in reaction to unpopular\r\ngovernment economic decisions.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $26.6 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 4% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $860 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 33%\r\nindustry : 17%\r\nservices: 50% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 133% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 11 million (1996 est.)\r\nby occupation: agriculture 80%, industry and commerce 10%, government\r\n6%\r\nnote: labor shortages for almost all categories of skilled employment\r\n(1983 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 30% (FY92/93 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $382 million\r\nexpenditures: $1.06 billion, including capital expenditures of $91\r\nmillion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: cotton ginning, textiles, cement, edible oils, sugar, soap\r\ndistilling, shoes, petroleum refining\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 6.8% (FY92/93 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 500,000 kW (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 1.3 billion kWh (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 37 kWh (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: cotton, groundnuts, sorghum, millet, wheat,\r\ngum arabic, sesame;

Following a dismal year in 1994 which saw the value of the\r\nSurinamese currency plummet by about 80%, inflation rise to more than\r\n600%, and national output fall for the fifth consecutive year, nearly\r\nall economic indicators improved in 1995-96. The government unified\r\nthe exchange rate and maintained a fairly tight monetary policy.\r\nInflation apparently has been eliminated, and tax revenues have\r\nincreased sufficiently to erase the budget deficit. The release of\r\nsubstantial development aid from the Netherlands - which had been held\r\nup due to the government's failure to initiate economic reforms - also\r\nhas helped buoy the economy.

Although US, UK, Dutch, and Swedish coal\r\ncompanies have mined in the past, the only companies still mining are\r\nNorwegian and Russian. The settlements on Svalbard are essentially\r\ncompany towns. The Norwegian state-owned coal company employs nearly\r\n60% of the Norwegian population on the island, runs many of the local\r\nservices, and provides most of the local infrastructure. There is also\r\nsome trapping of seal, polar bear, fox, and walrus.\r\n\r\nLabor force: NA\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues : $11.6 million\r\nexpenditures: $11.6 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n(1995 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: NA kW\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: NA kWh\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: NA kWh\r\n\r\nCurrency: 1 Norwegian krone (NKr) = 100 oere\r\n\r\nExchange rates: Norwegian kroner (NKr) per US$1 - 6.4475 (January\r\n1997), 6.4498 (1996), 6.3352 (1995), 7.0576 (1994), 7.0941 (1993),\r\n6.2145 (1992)\r\n\r\n@Svalbard:Communications\r\n\r\nTelephones: NA\r\n\r\nTelephone system:\r\ndomestic: local telephone service\r\ninternational: satellite earth station - 1 of NA type (for\r\ncommunication with Norwegian mainland only)\r\n\r\nRadio broadcast stations: AM 1, FM 1 (repeaters 2), shortwave 0\r\nnote: there are five meteorological/radio stations\r\n\r\nRadios: NA\r\n\r\nTelevision broadcast stations: 1\r\n\r\nTelevisions: NA\r\n\r\n@Svalbard:Transportation\r\n\r\nRailways: 0 km\r\n\r\nHighways:\r\ntotal : NA km\r\npaved: NA km\r\nunpaved : NA km\r\n\r\nPorts and harbors: Barentsburg, Longyearbyen, Ny-Alesund, Pyramiden\r\n\r\nMerchant marine: none\r\n\r\nAirports: 4 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nAirports - with paved runways:\r\ntotal: 4\r\n1,524 to 2,437 m: 1\r\nunder 914 m: 3 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nMilitary\r\n\r\nMilitary - note: demilitarized by treaty (9 February 1920)\r\n\r\nTransnational Issues\r\n\r\nDisputes - international: Svalbard is the focus of a maritime boundary\r\ndispute in the Barents Sea between Norway and Russia\r\n______________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nSWAZILAND\r\n\r\n@Swaziland:Geography\r\n\r\nLocation: Southern Africa, between Mozambique and South Africa\r\n\r\nGeographic coordinates: 26 30 S, 31 30 E\r\n\r\nMap references: Africa\r\n\r\nArea:\r\ntotal: 17,360 sq km\r\nland: 17,200 sq km\r\nwater: 160 sq km\r\n\r\nArea - comparative: slightly smaller than New Jersey\r\n\r\nLand boundaries:\r\ntotal : 535 km\r\nborder countries: Mozambique 105 km, South Africa 430 km\r\n\r\nCoastline: 0 km (landlocked)\r\n\r\nMaritime claims: none (landlocked)\r\n\r\nClimate: varies from tropical to near temperate\r\n\r\nTerrain: mostly mountains and hills;

Manufacturing features a number of agroprocessing\r\nfactories. Mining has declined in importance in recent years;\r\nhigh-grade iron ore deposits were depleted by 1978, and health\r\nconcerns have cut world demand for asbestos. Exports of soft drink\r\nconcentrate, sugar and wood pulp are the main earners of hard\r\ncurrency. Surrounded by South Africa, except for a short border with\r\nMozambique, Swaziland is heavily dependent on South Africa from which\r\nit receives nearly 90% of its imports and to which it sends more than\r\nhalf of its exports. Remittances from Swazi workers in South African\r\nmines supplement domestically earned income by as much as 20%. The\r\ngovernment is trying to improve the atmosphere for foreign investment.\r\nOvergrazing, soil depletion, and drought persist as problems for the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $3.8 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 2.9% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $3,800 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 12%\r\nindustry: 43%\r\nservices: 45% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 14.7% (1995)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 160,355 (1986 est.)\r\nby occupation: private sector about 65%, public sector 35%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 15% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $397 million\r\nexpenditures: $413 million, including capital expenditures of $78\r\nmillion (1995/96)\r\n\r\nIndustries: mining (coal and asbestos), wood pulp, sugar, soft drink\r\nconcentrates\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 4.2% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 50,000 kW (1993)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 84 million kWh (1993)\r\nnote: imports 90% of its electricity from South Africa\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 612 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: sugarcane, cotton, maize, tobacco, rice,\r\ncitrus, pineapples, corn, sorghum, peanuts;

It has a modern distribution system, excellent internal and\r\nexternal communications, and a skilled labor force. Timber,\r\nhydropower, and iron ore constitute the resource base of an economy\r\nheavily oriented toward foreign trade. Privately owned firms account\r\nfor about 90% of industrial output, of which the engineering sector\r\naccounts for 50% of output and exports. Agriculture accounts for only\r\n2% of GDP and 2% of the jobs. In recent years, however, this\r\nextraordinarily favorable picture has been clouded by budgetary\r\ndifficulties, inflation, growing unemployment, and a gradual loss of\r\ncompetitiveness in international markets. To curb the budget deficit\r\nand bolster confidence in the economy, the government adopted an\r\nadjustment program in November 1994 that aims to eliminate the\r\ngovernment budget deficit and to stabilize the debt to GDP ratio.\r\nSweden has harmonized its economic policies with those of the EU,\r\nwhich it joined at the start of 1995.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $184.3 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 1.4% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $20,800 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 2%\r\nindustry : 27%\r\nservices: 71% (1993)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 0.2% (September 1996)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 4.552 million (84% unionized, 1992)\r\nby occupation: community, social and personal services 38.3%, mining\r\nand manufacturing 21.2%, commerce, hotels, and restaurants 14.1%,\r\nbanking, insurance 9.0%, communications 7.2%, construction 7.0%,\r\nagriculture, fishing, and forestry 3.2% (1991)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 8% (September 1996) plus about 6% in training\r\nprograms\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $109.4 billion\r\nexpenditures : $146.1 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n(FY95/96)\r\n\r\nIndustries: iron and steel, precision equipment (bearings, radio and\r\ntelephone parts, armaments), wood pulp and paper products, processed\r\nfoods, motor vehicles\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 2% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 35.46 million kW (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 147.7 billion kWh (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 14,862 kWh (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: grains, sugar beets, potatoes;

GDP has dropped for five consecutive quarters,\r\nunemployment is reaching record levels, and the fiscal deficit is\r\nagain above 3% of GDP. In 1997, growth may reach barely 0.6%; a\r\nrecovery is not likely before mid to late 1997. Weak domestic consumer\r\ndemand is partly at fault; declining real disposable income is\r\ncombining with a reluctance to reduce saving rates in the face of an\r\nuncertain employment outlook. Switzerland's leading sectors, including\r\nfinancial services, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, and\r\nspecial-purpose machines, will therefore be more reliant on export\r\nmarkets at the same time they are being squeezed by the strong franc.\r\nConsequently, growth in machinery and equipment investment, for\r\nexample, is expected to taper off. On the other side, import growth in\r\n1997 also is likely to be lower than the 1995 rate of 6.6%, but higher\r\nthan 1996's expected 1.9%.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $161.3 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: -0.75% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $22,600 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 2.8%\r\nindustry: 31.1%\r\nservices: 66.1% (1995)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 0.8% (1996)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 3.776 million (939,000 foreign workers, mostly Italian)\r\nby occupation: services 67%, manufacturing and construction 29%,\r\nagriculture and forestry 4% (1994)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 5.3% (December 1996)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $31 billion\r\nexpenditures : $36.9 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n(1995)\r\n\r\nIndustries: machinery, chemicals, watches, textiles, precision\r\ninstruments\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: -2% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 14.27 million kW (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 62.2 billion kWh (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 6,810 kWh (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: grains, fruits, vegetables;

After an economic rebound in the\r\nearly 1990s in the wake of the Persian Gulf war, economic growth has\r\nslowed as the traditionally volatile economy has once again slumped.\r\nCurrent account and budget deficits and inflation are increasing. The\r\ndominant agricultural sector remains underdeveloped, with roughly 80%\r\nof agricultural land still dependent on rain-fed sources. Although\r\nSyria has sufficient water supplies in the aggregate at normal levels\r\nof precipitation, the great distance between major water supplies and\r\npopulation centers poses serious distribution problems, and the water\r\nproblem is exacerbated by rapid population growth, industrial\r\nexpansion, and increased water pollution. Unemployment remains a\r\nnagging problem because about 60% of the population is under the age\r\nof 20, ensuring a steady flow of job seekers into the already tight\r\nlabor market. Private investment is critical to the modernization of\r\nthe agricultural, energy, and export sectors, particularly because\r\nDamascus is saddled with a heavy foreign debt. Oil production is\r\nleveling off, and the efforts of the nonoil sector to penetrate\r\ninternational markets have fallen short. Syria's inadequate\r\ninfrastructure, outmoded technological base, and weak educational\r\nsystem hamper competition with neighbors such as Jordan and Israel.\r\nThe dominant public sector continues to be plagued by labor,\r\nfinancial, and management problems, and much of the private sector is\r\nhobbled by a shortage of capital. The economic benefits of any peace\r\ntreaty with Israel will depend in large part on the pace of economic\r\nreform.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $98.3 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 5.2% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $6,300 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 28%\r\nindustry: 18%\r\nservices: 54% (1994)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 20% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 4.7 million (1995 est.)\r\nby occupation: services 40%, agriculture 40%, industry 20% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 9% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $3 billion\r\nexpenditures : $3.7 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n(1995 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: petroleum, textiles, food processing, beverages, tobacco,\r\nphosphate rock mining\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 4.3% (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 4.16 million kW (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 14.25 billion kWh (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 902 kWh (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: wheat, barley, cotton, lentils, chickpeas;\r\nbeef, lamb, eggs, poultry, milk\r\n\r\nExports:\r\ntotal value: $4.4 billion (f.o.b., 1996 est.)\r\ncommodities: petroleum 56%, food and live animals 16%, textiles 16%\r\n(1994 est.)\r\npartners: EU 57% (Germany 17%, Italy 16%, France 11%), Lebanon 14%,\r\nSaudi Arabia 7% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nImports:\r\ntotal value : $5.2 billion (c.i.f., 1996 est.)\r\ncommodities: machinery 25%, food and live animals 15%, transport\r\nequipment 12%, chemicals 8% (1994 est.)\r\npartners: EU 33% (Italy 9%, Germany 8%, France 4%), South Korea 4.5%,\r\nUS 4%, Japan 3% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nDebt - external: $22 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nEconomic aid:\r\nrecipient: $4.2 billion (1990-92)\r\n\r\nCurrency: 1 Syrian pound (£S) = 100 piastres\r\n\r\nExchange rates: Syrian pounds (£S) per US$1 - 41.9 (January 1997);\r\nofficial fixed rate 11.225\r\n\r\nFiscal year: calendar year\r\n\r\n@Syria:Communications\r\n\r\nTelephones: 541,465 (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nTelephone system: fair system currently undergoing significant\r\nimprovement and digital upgrades, including fiber-optic technology\r\ndomestic: coaxial cable and microwave radio relay network\r\ninternational: satellite earth stations - 1 Intelsat (Indian Ocean)\r\nand 1 Intersputnik (Atlantic Ocean region);

The current president,\r\nEmomali RAHMONOV, was elected in November 1994, yet has been in power\r\nsince 1992. The country is suffering through its fourth year of a\r\ncivil conflict, with no clear end in sight. Underlying the conflict\r\nare deeply rooted regional and clan-based animosities that pit a\r\ngovernment consisting of people primarily from the Kulob (Kulyab),\r\nKhujand (Leninabad), and Hisor (Hissar) regions against a secular and\r\nIslamic-led opposition from the Gharm, Gorno-Badakhshan, and\r\nQurghonteppa (Kurgan-Tyube) regions. Government and opposition\r\nrepresentatives have held periodic rounds of UN-mediated peace talks\r\nand agreed in September 1994 to a cease-fire which has been\r\nperiodically extended. Russian-led peacekeeping troops are deployed\r\nthroughout the country, and Russian-commanded border guards are\r\nstationed along the Tajikistani-Afghan border.\r\n\r\n@Tajikistan:Geography\r\n\r\nLocation: Central Asia, west of China\r\n\r\nGeographic coordinates: 39 00 N, 71 00 E\r\n\r\nMap references: Commonwealth of Independent States\r\n\r\nArea:\r\ntotal : 143,100 sq km\r\nland: 142,700 sq km\r\nwater: 400 sq km\r\n\r\nArea - comparative: slightly smaller than Wisconsin\r\n\r\nLand boundaries:\r\ntotal: 3,651 km\r\nborder countries: Afghanistan 1,206 km, China 414 km, Kyrgyzstan 870\r\nkm, Uzbekistan 1,161 km\r\n\r\nCoastline: 0 km (landlocked)\r\n\r\nMaritime claims: none (landlocked)\r\n\r\nClimate: midlatitude continental, hot summers, mild winters;

Industry is limited to a large aluminum plant,\r\nhydropower facilities, and small obsolete factories mostly in light\r\nindustry and food processing. The Tajik economy has been gravely\r\nweakened by four years of civil conflict and by the loss of subsidies\r\nfrom Moscow and of markets for its products, which has left Tajikistan\r\ndependent on Russia and Uzbekistan and on international humanitarian\r\nassistance for much of its basic subsistence needs.

The economy is heavily dependent on agriculture, which accounts\r\nfor 57% of GDP, provides 85% of exports, and employs 90% of the work\r\nforce. Topography and climatic conditions, however, limit cultivated\r\ncrops to only 4% of the land area. Industry accounts for 17% of GDP\r\nand is mainly limited to processing agricultural products and light\r\nconsumer goods. The economic recovery program announced in mid-1986\r\nhas generated notable increases in agricultural production and\r\nfinancial support for the program by bilateral donors. The World Bank,\r\nthe International Monetary Fund, and bilateral donors have provided\r\nfunds to rehabilitate Tanzania's deteriorated economic infrastructure.\r\nGrowth in 1991-96 has featured a pickup in industrial production and a\r\nsubstantial increase in output of minerals, led by gold.

Cocoa,\r\ncoffee, and cotton together generate about 30% of export earnings.\r\nTogo is self-sufficient in basic foodstuffs when harvests are normal.\r\nIn the industrial sector, phosphate mining is by far the most\r\nimportant activity, although it has suffered from the collapse of\r\nworld phosphate prices and increased foreign competition. Togo serves\r\nas a regional commercial and trade center. The government's\r\ndecade-long effort, supported by the World Bank and the IMF, to\r\nimplement economic reform measures, encourage foreign investment, and\r\nbring revenues in line with expenditures has stalled. Political\r\nunrest, including private and public sector strikes throughout 1992\r\nand 1993, has jeopardized the reform program, shrunk the tax base, and\r\ndisrupted vital economic activity. Although strikes had ended in 1994,\r\npolitical unrest and lack of funds prevented the government from\r\ntaking advantage of the 50% currency devaluation of 12 January 1994.\r\nResumption of World Bank and IMF flows will depend on implementation\r\nof several controversial moves toward privatization and on downsizing\r\nthe military, on which the regime depends to stay in power.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $4.45 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 6% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $970 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 35%\r\nindustry: 23%\r\nservices: 42% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 7.2% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 1.538 million (1993 est.)\r\nby occupation: agriculture 64%, industry 9%, services 21%, unemployed\r\n6% (1981 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $242 million\r\nexpenditures: $262 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n(1997 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: phosphate mining, agricultural processing, cement;\r\nhandicrafts, textiles, beverages\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: NA kW\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: NA kWh\r\nnote: imports electricity from Ghana\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: NA kWh\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: coffee, cocoa, cotton, yams, cassava\r\n(tapioca), corn, beans, rice, millet, sorghum;

Squash, coconuts, bananas, and vanilla beans\r\nare the main crops, and agricultural exports make up two-thirds of\r\ntotal exports. The country must import a high proportion of its food,\r\nmainly from New Zealand. The industrial sector accounts for only 13%\r\nof GDP. Tourism is the primary source of hard currency earnings, but\r\nthe country also remains dependent on sizable external aid and\r\nremittances to offset its trade deficit. The economy continued to grow\r\nin 1993-95 largely because of a rise in squash exports, increased aid\r\nflows, and several large construction projects, but contracted in\r\n1995-96. The government is now turning its attention to further\r\ndevelopment of the private sector and the reduction of the budget\r\ndeficit. Current proposals include selling Tongan citizenship and\r\npassports to foreigners, leasing its seven equatorial satellite spots,\r\nand setting up a joint venture gas production facility with South\r\nKorea.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $228 million (FY95/96 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: -1.9% (FY95/96 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $2,140 (FY95/96 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 36%\r\nindustry: 13%\r\nservices: 51% (1994)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 1.4% (1995)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 32,013 (1990 est.)\r\nby occupation : agriculture 70% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $44 million\r\nexpenditures : $86 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n(1995 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: tourism, fishing\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 7,000 kW (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 30 million kWh (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: NA kWh\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: coconuts, copra, bananas, vanilla beans,\r\ncocoa, coffee, ginger, black pepper\r\n\r\nExports:\r\ntotal value : $15.25 million (f.o.b., 1995)\r\ncommodities: squash, vanilla, fish, root crops, coconut oil\r\npartners: Japan 59%, US 14%, Australia 6%, NZ 6% (FY93/94)\r\n\r\nImports:\r\ntotal value: $80.3 million (c.i.f., 1995)\r\ncommodities : food products, live animals, machinery and transport\r\nequipment, manufactures, fuels, chemicals\r\npartners: NZ 38%, Australia 28%, US 10%, Fiji 7.5% (1995)\r\n\r\nDebt - external: $48.4 million (FY93/94)\r\n\r\nEconomic aid:\r\nrecipient: ODA, $7.8 million from Australia (FY96/97 est.);

Successful\r\neconomic reforms implemented in 1995 are expected to bring an average\r\ngrowth rate of 2% over the next three years, and foreign investment\r\nand trade are flourishing. Unemployment - a main cause of the\r\ncountry's socio-economic problems - is high, but has decreased to its\r\nlowest point in five years. The country enjoys a healthy trade surplus\r\nof $500 million, yet its heavy dependence on oil and petrochemical\r\nprices makes its trade balance vulnerable to sudden shifts.\r\nFurthermore, Caricom, Trinidad and Tobago's main market, is saturated,\r\nprovoking some countries to establish non-tariff trade barriers.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $17.1 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 3.1% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $13,500 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 2%\r\nindustry: 45%\r\nservices: 53% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 5.3% (1995)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 404,500\r\nby occupation: construction and utilities 13%, manufacturing, mining,\r\nand quarrying 14%, agriculture 11%, services 62% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 16.1% (December 1996)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $1.65 billion\r\nexpenditures: $1.61 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n(1996 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: petroleum, chemicals, tourism, food processing, cement,\r\nbeverage, cotton textiles\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 1% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 1.253 million kW (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 4.229 billion kWh (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 2,885 kWh (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: cocoa, sugarcane, rice, citrus, coffee,\r\nvegetables;

Real growth has averaged 4.5% in 1991-96, and\r\ninflation has been moderate. Growth in tourism and increased trade\r\nhave been key elements in this solid record. Agricultural production\r\naccounted for a major portion of growth in GDP in 1996, growth having\r\nbeen adversely affected by drought in 1995. Further privatization, the\r\nattraction of increased foreign investment, and improvements in\r\ngovernment efficiency are among the challenges for the future.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $43.3 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 7.1% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $4,800 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 13.5%\r\nindustry: 33.8%\r\nservices: 52.7% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 6% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 2.917 million (1993 est.)\r\nby occupation: services 55%, industry 23%, agriculture 22% (1995 est.)\r\nnote : shortage of skilled labor\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 16% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues : $5.2 billion\r\nexpenditures: $7.2 billion, including capital expenditures to $1.4\r\nbillion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: petroleum, mining (particularly phosphate and iron ore),\r\ntourism, textiles, footwear, food, beverages\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 3.5% (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 1.7 million kW (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 6.5 billion kWh (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 678 kWh (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: olives, dates, oranges, almonds, grain, sugar\r\nbeets, grapes;

The economy has a strong and rapidly growing\r\nprivate sector, yet the state still plays a major role in basic\r\nindustry, banking, transport, and communication. The current economic\r\nsituation is marked by strong growth coupled with worsening\r\nimbalances. Real GDP expanded by about 7% in 1996 but inflation rose\r\nto 80%, the current account deficit reached about 3% of GDP, and the\r\npublic sector fiscal deficit probably topped 10% of GDP, leading to\r\nspeculation that the country could be headed toward a repeat of its\r\n1994 financial crisis. To some extent, Ankara is caught in a vicious\r\ncircle because half of all central government revenue in 1996 went to\r\npay interest on the national debt. The government that took office in\r\nJuly 1996 - an unusual coalition of Prime Minister ERBAKAN's Islamic\r\nWelfare Party and Deputy Prime Minister CILLER's conservative True\r\nPath Party - is trying to solve the fiscal problem by greatly\r\naccelerating Turkey's privatization program. It has proposed a\r\nbalanced budget for 1997, although this is widely regarded as over\r\noptimistic because it is based on earning more privatization revenue\r\nin one year than Turkey has earned over the last decade. Ankara is\r\ntrying to increase trade with other countries in the region but most\r\nof Turkey's trade is still with OECD countries. Despite the\r\nimplementation in January 1996 of a customs union with the EU, foreign\r\ndirect investment in the country totaled only about half a billion\r\ndollars, perhaps because potential investors were concerned about the\r\nprospects for economic stability.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $379.1 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 7% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $6,100 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture : 15%\r\nindustry: 33%\r\nservices: 52% (1995)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 80% (1996)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 21.3 million\r\nby occupation: agriculture 47%, services 33%, industry 20% (1995)\r\nnote: about 1.5 million Turks work abroad (1994)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 6.3% (April 1996);

One-half of its irrigated land is planted\r\nin cotton, making it the world's tenth largest producer. It also\r\npossesses the world's fifth largest reserves of natural gas and\r\nsubstantial oil resources. Until the end of 1993, Turkmenistan had\r\nexperienced less economic disruption than other former Soviet states\r\nbecause its economy received a boost from higher prices for oil and\r\ngas and a sharp increase in hard currency earnings. In 1994, Russia's\r\nrefusal to export Turkmen gas to hard currency markets and mounting\r\ndebts of its major customers in the former USSR for gas deliveries\r\ncontributed to a sharp fall in industrial production and caused the\r\nbudget to shift from a surplus to a slight deficit. The economy\r\nrecovered slightly in 1996, but high inflation continued. Furthermore,\r\nwith an authoritarian ex-communist regime in power and a tribally\r\nbased social structure, Turkmenistan has taken a cautious approach to\r\neconomic reform, hoping to use gas and cotton sales to sustain its\r\ninefficient economy. In 1996, the government set in place a\r\nstabilization program aimed at a unified and market-based exchange\r\nrate, allocation of government credits by auction, and strict limits\r\non budget deficits. Privatization goals remain limited. Turkmenistan\r\nis working hard to open new gas export channels through Iran and\r\nTurkey to Europe, but these will take many years to realize.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $11.8 billion (1996 estimate as\r\nextrapolated from World Bank estimate for 1994)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 0.1% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $2,840 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture : 16%\r\nindustry: 48%\r\nservices: 36% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 600% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal : 1.68 million (1995)\r\nby occupation: agriculture and forestry 43%, industry and construction\r\n20%, other 37% (1992)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $NA\r\nexpenditures: $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n\r\nIndustries: natural gas, oil, petroleum products, textiles, food\r\nprocessing\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 17.9% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 3.95 million kW (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 9.87 billion kWh (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 1,855 kWh (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: cotton, grain;

The country has no known\r\nmineral resources and few exports. Subsistence farming and fishing are\r\nthe primary economic activities. The islands are too small and too\r\nremote for development of a large-scale tourist industry. Government\r\nrevenues largely come from the sale of stamps and coins and worker\r\nremittances. About 1,000 Tuvaluans work in Nauru in the phosphate\r\nmining industry. Nauru has begun repatriating Tuvaluans, however, as\r\nphosphate resources decline, which will present additional problems\r\nfor Tuvalu's already stretched economy. Substantial income is received\r\nannually from an international trust fund established in 1987 by\r\nAustralia, NZ, and the UK and supported also by Japan and South Korea.\r\nIn an effort to reduce its dependence on foreign aid, the government\r\nis pursuing public sector reforms, including privatization of some\r\ngovernment functions and personnel cuts of up to 7%.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $7.8 million (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 8.7% (1995)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $800 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture : NA%\r\nindustry: NA%\r\nservices: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 2.9% (1989)\r\n\r\nLabor force: NA\r\nby occupation : NA\r\nnote: people make a living mainly through exploitation of the sea,\r\nreefs, and atolls and from wages sent home by those working abroad\r\n(mostly workers in the phosphate industry and sailors)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $4.3 million\r\nexpenditures: $4.3 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n(1989 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: fishing, tourism, copra\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 2,600 kW (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 3 million kWh (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: NA kWh\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: coconuts;

Agriculture is the most important\r\nsector of the economy, employing over 80% of the work force. Coffee is\r\nthe major export crop and accounts for the bulk of export revenues.\r\nSince 1986 the government - with the support of foreign countries and\r\ninternational agencies - has acted to rehabilitate and stabilize the\r\neconomy by undertaking currency reform, raising producer prices on\r\nexport crops, increasing prices of petroleum products, and improving\r\ncivil service wages. The policy changes are especially aimed at\r\ndampening inflation and boosting production and export earnings. In\r\n1990-94, the economy turned in a solid performance based on continued\r\ninvestment in the rehabilitation of infrastructure, improved\r\nincentives for production and exports, and gradually improving\r\ndomestic security. The economy again prospered in 1995 with rapid\r\ngrowth, low inflation, growing foreign investment, a trimmed\r\nbureaucracy, and the continued return of exiled Indian-Ugandan\r\nentrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $16.8 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 7.1% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $900 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 55%\r\nindustry : 12%\r\nservices: 33% (1995)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 7.3% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 8.361 million (1993 est.)\r\nby occupation: agriculture 86%, industry 4%, services 10% (1980 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $766.5 million\r\nexpenditures : $894.3 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n(FY94/95 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: sugar, brewing, tobacco, cotton textiles, cement\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 15% (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 155,000 kW (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 611 million kWh (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 31 kWh (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: coffee, tea, cotton, tobacco, cassava\r\n(tapioca), potatoes, corn, millet, pulses;

Likewise, its\r\ndiversified heavy industry supplied equipment and raw materials to\r\nindustrial and mining sites in other regions of the former USSR.\r\nShortly after the implosion of the USSR in December 1991, the\r\nUkrainian Government liberalized most prices and erected a legal\r\nframework for privatization, but widespread resistance to reform\r\nwithin the government and the legislature soon stalled reform efforts\r\nand led to some backtracking. Output in 1992-96 fell precipitously to\r\nless than half the 1991 level. Loose monetary policies pushed\r\ninflation to hyperinflationary levels in late 1993. Since his election\r\nin July 1994, President KUCHMA has pushed a comprehensive economic\r\nreform program, maintained financial discipline, and tried to remove\r\nalmost all remaining controls over prices and foreign trade.\r\nImplementation of KUCHMA's economic agenda is encountering\r\nconsiderable resistance from parliament, entrenched bureaucrats, and\r\nindustrial interests. However, if KUCHMA succeeds in implementing\r\naggressive market reforms during 1997, the economy should reverse its\r\ndownward trend, with real growth occurring by late 1997 and into 1998.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $161.1 billion (1996 estimate as\r\nextrapolated from World Bank estimate for 1994)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: -10% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $3,170 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture : 14%\r\nindustry: 45%\r\nservices: 41% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 40% (yearend 1996)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 23 million (January 1996)\r\nby occupation: industry and construction 33%, agriculture and forestry\r\n21%, health, education, and culture 16%, trade and distribution 7%,\r\ntransport and communication 7%, other 16% (1992)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 1% officially registered;

Over the past 17 years the\r\nruling Tories have greatly reduced public ownership and contained the\r\ngrowth of social welfare programs. Agriculture is intensive, highly\r\nmechanized, and efficient by European standards, producing about 60%\r\nof food needs with only about 1% of the labor force. The UK has large\r\ncoal, natural gas, and oil reserves; primary energy production\r\naccounts for 12% of GDP, one of the highest shares of any industrial\r\nnation. Services, particularly banking, insurance, and business\r\nservices, account by far for the largest proportion of GDP while\r\nindustry continues to decline in importance, now employing only 25% of\r\nthe work force. The economy registered 3.9% GDP growth in 1994, the\r\nbest rate for six years, but slipped back to 2.7% in 1995 and 2.4% in\r\n1996. Exports and manufacturing output have been the primary engines\r\nof growth. Unemployment is gradually falling. Inflation is a\r\ncomfortable 2.6%. A major economic policy question for the UK in the\r\nlate 1990s is the terms on which it participates in the financial and\r\neconomic integration of Europe.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $1.19 trillion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 2.4% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $20,400 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 1.9%\r\nindustry: 34.1%\r\nservices : 64% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 2.6% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal : 28.1 million (September 1996)\r\nby occupation: services 62.8%, manufacturing and construction 25.0%,\r\ngovernment 9.1%, energy 1.9%, agriculture 1.2% (June 1992)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 6.7% (December 1996)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues : $421.5 billion\r\nexpenditures: $474.9 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n(FY95/96 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: production machinery including machine tools, electric\r\npower equipment, automation equipment, railroad equipment,\r\nshipbuilding, aircraft, motor vehicles and parts, electronics and\r\ncommunications equipment, metals, chemicals, coal, petroleum, paper\r\nand paper products, food processing, textiles, clothing, and other\r\nconsumer goods\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 1% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 66.15 million kW (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 327.7 billion kWh (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 5,178 kWh (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: cereals, oilseed, potatoes, vegetables;\r\ncattle, sheep, poultry;

In this\r\nmarket-oriented economy, private individuals and business firms make\r\nmost of the decisions, and government buys needed goods and services\r\npredominantly in the private marketplace. US business firms enjoy\r\nconsiderably greater flexibility than their counterparts in Western\r\nEurope and Japan in decisions to expand capital plant, lay off surplus\r\nworkers, and develop new products. At the same time, they face higher\r\nbarriers to entry in their rivals' home markets than the barriers to\r\nentry of foreign firms in US markets. In all economic sectors, US\r\nfirms are at or near the forefront in technological advances,\r\nespecially in computers, and medical, aerospace, and military\r\nequipment, although their advantage has narrowed since the end of\r\nWorld War II. The onrush of technology largely explains the gradual\r\ndevelopment of a \"two-tier labor market\" in which those at the bottom\r\nlack the education and the professional/technical skills of those at\r\nthe top and, more and more, fail to get pay raises, health insurance\r\ncoverage, and other benefits. The years 1994-96 witnessed moderate\r\ngains in real output, low inflation rates, and a drop in unemployment\r\nbelow 6%. Long-term problems include inadequate investment in economic\r\ninfrastructure, rapidly rising medical costs of an aging population,\r\nsizable budget and trade deficits, and stagnation of family income in\r\nthe lower economic groups. The outlook for 1997 is for continued\r\nmoderate growth, low inflation, and about the same level of\r\nunemployment.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $7.61 trillion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 2.4% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $28,600 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 2%\r\nindustry: 23%\r\nservices: 75% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 3% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 133.943 million (includes unemployed) (1996)\r\nby occupation: managerial and professional 28.8%, technical, sales and\r\nadministrative support 29.7%, services 13.6%, manufacturing, mining,\r\ntransportation, and crafts 25.1%, farming, forestry, and fishing 2.8%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 5.4% (1996)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $1.351 trillion\r\nexpenditures: $1.514 trillion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n(1995)\r\n\r\nIndustries: leading industrial power in the world, highly diversified\r\nand technologically advanced;

Economic\r\ndevelopment has been restrained in recent years by high - though\r\ndeclining - inflation and extensive government regulation. The\r\nSANGUINETTI government's conservative monetary and fiscal policies are\r\naimed at continuing to reduce inflation, at 24.3% at yearend 1996;\r\nother priorities include extensive reform of the social security\r\nsystem and increased investment in education. Uruguay recovered from\r\nrecession in 1996 - partly due to the recovery in Argentina - and\r\nended the year with a nearly 5% rise in GDP. Uruguayan trade continued\r\nto expand and the potential for new markets continued to open through\r\nthe negotiations of Mercosur (Southern Cone Common Market) with\r\nneighboring countries and the European Union (EU).

It was\r\none of the poorest areas of the former Soviet Union with more than 60%\r\nof its population living in overpopulated rural communities.\r\nUzbekistan is now the world's third largest cotton exporter, a major\r\nproducer of gold and natural gas, and a regionally significant\r\nproducer of chemicals and machinery. Following independence in\r\nDecember 1991, the government sought to prop up its Soviet-style\r\ncommand economy with subsidies and tight controls on production and\r\nprices. Faced with high rates of inflation, however, the government\r\nstepped up the pace of reform in mid-1994, by introducing tighter\r\nmonetary policies, expanding privatization, slightly reducing the role\r\nof the state in the economy, and improving the environment for foreign\r\ninvestors. Nevertheless, the state continues to be a dominating\r\ninfluence in the economy, and reforms have so far failed to bring\r\nabout much-needed structural changes. The IMF suspended Uzbekistan's\r\n$185 million standby arrangement in late 1996 because of governmental\r\nsteps that made impossible fulfillment of Fund conditions.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $57 billion (1996 estimate as\r\nextrapolated from World Bank estimate for 1994)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 1.6% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $2,430 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 29%\r\nindustry: 24%\r\nservices: 47% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 55% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 8.2 million\r\nby occupation: agriculture and forestry 44%, industry and construction\r\n20%, other 36% (1995)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 0.3% includes only officially registered\r\nunemployed;

It is likely to become even more\r\nimportant as the state petroleum company plans to double its\r\nproduction over the next ten years. The non-petroleum sectors have\r\nbeen contracting, however, with GDP shrinking by 1.6% during 1996.\r\nRealizing the failure of interventionist policies, the CALDERA\r\nadministration embarked on a comprehensive reform program and\r\nsuccessfully negotiated a $1.4 billion stand-by agreement with the\r\nIMF. The state eliminated price and exchange controls, reduced the\r\nlong-standing subsidy on gasoline, and revitalized its stalled\r\nprivatization program. Foreign investors reacted positively and the\r\nCaracas stock exchange ended 1996 as the world's best performing stock\r\nmarket. The influx of foreign investment and a windfall of oil\r\nrevenues resulting from higher-than-expected international oil prices\r\nraised Venezuela's reserves to over $15 billion. As a result,\r\nVenezuela used only the first tranche of the IMF credit - $400\r\nmillion. The currency depreciated sharply following the exchange\r\nliberalization, and caused an inflationary burst that led to a 103%\r\nyearly rate of inflation, the highest in Venezuelan history. The\r\nbolivar has since strengthened and inflation fell near the end of the\r\nyear. The macroeconomic adjustments should take hold in 1997, and the\r\neconomy is expected to grow by 4% or more. Increased salary demands by\r\npublic and private sector workers, however, threaten a renewal of\r\ninflationary pressures.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $197 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: -1.6% (1996)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $9,000 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 5%\r\nindustry: 41%\r\nservices: 54% (1993)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 103% (1996)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 8.8 million\r\nby occupation : services 64%, industry 23%, agriculture 13% (1993)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 13% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $11.99 billion\r\nexpenditures : $11.48 billion, including capital expenditures of $2.3\r\nbillion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: petroleum, iron ore mining, construction materials, food\r\nprocessing, textiles, steel, aluminum, motor vehicle assembly\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 0.5% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 18.966 million kW (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 74.886 billion kWh (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 2,887 kWh (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: corn, sorghum, sugarcane, rice, bananas,\r\nvegetables, coffee;

Substantial progress has been achieved over the past\r\n10 years in moving forward from an extremely low starting point.\r\nEconomic growth continued at a strong pace during 1996 with industrial\r\noutput rising by 14% and real GDP expanding by 9.4%. Foreign direct\r\ninvestment rose to an estimated $2.3 billion for the year, up by about\r\n30% from 1995. These positive numbers, however, masked some major\r\ndifficulties that are emerging in economic performance. Many domestic\r\nindustries, including coal, cement, steel, and paper, reported large\r\nstockpiles of inventory and tough competition from more efficient\r\nforeign producers. Vietnam's trade deficit widened to $4 billion in\r\n1996, up over 80% from a year ago. While disbursements of aid and\r\nforeign direct investment have risen, they are not large enough to\r\nfinance the rapid increase in imports and it is widely believed that\r\nVietnam may be using short-term trade credits to bridge the gap - a\r\nrisky strategy that could result in a foreign exchange crunch during\r\n1997. Meanwhile, Vietnamese authorities continue to move very slowly\r\ntoward implementing the structural reforms needed to revitalize the\r\neconomy and produce more competitive, export-driven industries.\r\nPrivatization of state enterprises remains bogged down in political\r\ncontroversy, while the country's dynamic private sector is denied both\r\nfinancing and access to markets. Reform of the banking sector is\r\nproceeding slowly, raising concerns that the country will be unable to\r\ntap sufficient domestic savings to maintain current high levels of\r\ngrowth. Administrative and legal barriers are also causing costly\r\ndelays for foreign investors and are raising similar doubts about\r\nVietnam's ability to maintain the inflow of foreign capital.\r\nIdeological bias in favor of state intervention and control of the\r\neconomy is slowing progress toward a more liberalized investment\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $108.7 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 9.4% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $1,470 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 28%\r\nindustry: 28%\r\nservices: 44% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 4.5% (1996)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\ntotal: 32.7 million\r\nby occupation: agriculture 65%, industry and services 35% (1990 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 25% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues: $4.67 billion\r\nexpenditures: $5 billion, including capital expenditures of $1.36\r\nbillion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: food processing, garments, shoes, machine building,\r\nmining, cement, chemical fertilizer, glass, tires, oil\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 14% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity - capacity: 5.32 million kW (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - production: 11.78 billion kWh (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 154 kWh (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nAgriculture - products: paddy rice, corn, potatoes, rubber, soybeans,\r\ncoffee, tea, bananas;

Permanent status negotiations began on 5 May 1996. Under\r\nthe DOP, Israel agreed to transfer certain powers and responsibilities\r\nto the Palestinian Authority, which includes a Palestinian Legislative\r\nCouncil elected in January 1996, as part of interim self-governing\r\narrangements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. A transfer of powers and\r\nresponsibilities for the Gaza Strip and Jericho has taken place\r\npursuant to the Israel-PLO 4 May 1994 Cairo Agreement on the Gaza\r\nStrip and the Jericho Area and in additional areas of the West Bank\r\npursuant to the Israel-PLO 28 September 1995 Interim Agreement. The\r\nDOP provides that Israel will retain responsibility during the\r\ntransitional period for external security and for internal security\r\nand public order of settlements and Israelis.

Industries using\r\nadvanced technology or requiring sizable investment have been\r\ndiscouraged by a lack of local capital and restrictive Israeli\r\npolicies. Capital investment consists largely of residential housing,\r\nnot productive assets that would enable local Palestinian firms to\r\ncompete with Israeli industry.

Increasingly, tourism is becoming\r\na significant source of revenue, earning approximately $34 million in\r\n1995. While registering an overall economic improvement in 1995,\r\nhowever, the country continues to struggle with a series of natural\r\ndisasters from the early 1990s which wiped out the nation's\r\ninfrastructure as well as its then-major export crop, taro root.\r\nAgriculture continues to be a key source of wealth for Apia, employing\r\nmore than one-half of the labor force, and furnishing 90% of exports.\r\nThe bulk of these export earnings comes from the sale of coconut\r\ncream, coconut oil, and copra.

And once more, results varied\r\nwidely among regions and countries. Average growth of 2.3% in the GDP\r\nof industrialized countries (55% of GWP in 1996) and average growth of\r\n6.5% in the GDP of less developed countries (39% of GWP) were partly\r\noffset by a 2% drop in the GDP of the former USSR/Eastern Europe area\r\n(only 6% of GWP). With the notable exception of Japan at 3%,\r\nunemployment was typically 6%-12% in the industrial world. The US\r\naccounted for 21% of GWP in 1996; Western Europe accounted for 20%;\r\nand Japan accounted for 8%. These are the three \"economic superpowers\"\r\npresumably destined to compete for mastery in international markets on\r\ninto the 21st century. As for the less developed countries: China,\r\nIndia, and the Four Dragons - South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and\r\nSingapore - once again posted records of 5% growth or better; however,\r\nmany other countries, especially in Africa, continued to suffer from\r\ndrought, rapid population growth, inflation, and civil strife. Central\r\nEurope and the 15 successor states to the USSR generally made progress\r\nin moving toward \"market-friendly\" economies, but output in Russia and\r\nUkraine continued to fall. Externally, the nation-state, as a bedrock\r\neconomic-political institution, is steadily losing control over\r\ninternational flows of people, goods, funds, and technology.\r\nInternally, the central government in a number of cases is losing\r\ncontrol over resources as separatist regional movements - typically\r\nbased on ethnicity - gain momentum, e.g., in the successor states of\r\nthe former Soviet Union, in the former Yugoslavia, in India, and in\r\nCanada. In Western Europe, governments face the difficult political\r\nproblem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to\r\nincrease investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment. The\r\naddition of nearly 100 million people each year to an already\r\novercrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of pollution,\r\ndesertification, underemployment, epidemics, and famine. Because of\r\ntheir own internal problems, the industrialized countries have\r\ninadequate resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the\r\nworld, which, at least from the economic point of view, are becoming\r\nfurther marginalized.

Future\r\neconomic development depends heavily on Western-assisted development\r\nof the country's moderate oil resources. Former South Yemen's\r\nwillingness to merge stemmed partly from the steady decline in Soviet\r\neconomic support. The low level of domestic industry and agriculture\r\nhas made northern Yemen dependent on imports for practically all of\r\nits essential needs. Once self-sufficient in food production, northern\r\nYemen has become a major importer. Land once used for export crops -\r\ncotton, fruit, and vegetables - has been turned over to growing a\r\nshrub called qat, whose leaves are chewed for their stimulant effect\r\nby Yemenis and which has no significant export market. Economic growth\r\nin former South Yemen has been constrained by a lack of incentives,\r\npartly stemming from centralized control over production decisions,\r\ninvestment allocation, and import choices. Yemen's GDP has been\r\nsupplemented by remittances from Yemenis working abroad and by foreign\r\naid. Since the Gulf crisis, however, remittances have dropped\r\nsubstantially. Floods in June 1996 caused the loss of much valuable\r\ntopsoil in the agricultural sector, increasing the need for imports of\r\nfoodstuffs. Oil production and GDP as a whole are expected to increase\r\nmoderately in 1997.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $39.1 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - real growth rate: 2.8% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $2,900 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP - composition by sector:\r\nagriculture: 14%\r\nindustry: 35%\r\nservices : 51%\r\n\r\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 85% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: no reliable estimates exist, most people are employed in\r\nagriculture and herding or as expatriate laborers;

Zambia's copper mining sector, which accounts for over 80%\r\nof the nation's foreign currency intake, is struggling. Production\r\nrates are down as are world copper prices. Aid cuts by Zambia's\r\ndonors, arising out of concern for the November 1996 flawed election,\r\nwill severely damage Zambia's economic prospects.

Real growth in GDP has averaged about 9% a year\r\nduring the past three decades. Export growth has been even faster and\r\nhas provided the impetus for industrialization. Inflation and\r\nunemployment are low. Agriculture contributes less than 4% to GDP,\r\ndown from 35% in 1952.
