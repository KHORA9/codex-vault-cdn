They shot two men off the Moon--out from the sun and away from the\r\nearth--in a new great ship with a shiny hull and a miracle fuel.\r\n\r\nThe ship went out with a blast and a prayer. After three years it came\r\nback with a sigh, unpowered, fuel-less, floating in slow-spiralled\r\norbit through empty sky around the Moon. It came back with its hull\r\nscratched and dented and darkened from the dust and debris of space,\r\nthe wind and sands of Mars. It came back with one man in it instead of\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\nJohnny Wendt was the one who came back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART ONE\r\n\r\n_January 1976--June 23, 1977_\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rockland, N. Y.--Thursday, June 23, 1:30_ A.M. (_E.D.S.T._)\r\n\r\nHe woke up screaming again.\r\n\r\nOr else he dreamed the scream?\r\n\r\nBut when his eyes started to open, they closed reactively against the\r\nlight. So Lee was up. And so it was no dream.\r\n\r\nSweat tickled his neck, but he lay still, breathing evenly, eyes shut.\r\nHe would talk to her in the morning. Not now. In the morning it would\r\nbe better, but not _now_....\r\n\r\nHe opened his eyes a slit to make sure. It was her light, all right.\r\nShe was sitting up, watching him.\r\n\r\n“Sorry, darling,” she said. “I couldn’t get to sleep, I didn’t think\r\nthe light would bother you....”\r\n\r\n“Huh?” He blinked his eyes open wider. She was sitting, but with a\r\npillow propped behind her back, book on her lap. “No, ‘sarigh’,” he\r\nmumbled. “Go ’head. Light don’ bother....”\r\n\r\nShe’d been reading.... _She had been up first!_ He shook his head,\r\nclearing it, got her in focus. The flicker of frown on her forehead was\r\napology, not worry....\r\n\r\nSo it _had_ been a dream?\r\n\r\n“Hey,” he said, “Was I...?” He twisted his neck cautiously, felt for\r\nthe knot in back with an exploring hand. “I feel like.... Was I keeping\r\nyou up, babe? Thrashing around, or ... anything?”\r\n\r\n“No. It was just this damn book. I got started reading it and I kept\r\nthinking and I couldn’t sleep--I’m sorry, darling,” she said again.\r\n\r\nShe closed the book with a snap and reached for the light switch.\r\n\r\n_No!_\r\n\r\n“Don’t quit on account of me,” he said quickly. “Light doesn’t bother\r\nme.” _Jesus, what a dream!_ “Anyhow, I’m up now.” He rubbed at his\r\nneck, groped under the pillow and found his handkerchief. “I guess I\r\nwas dreaming.” He wiped sweat from his forehead and neck and face. Then\r\nhe swung his legs out of the bed and stood up. “Coffee?”\r\n\r\nLisa hesitated, shook her head: No.\r\n\r\nJohnny found his shorts on the floor, pulled them on. There was sweat\r\non his thighs, too. Sticky and drying. _A shower_, he thought ...\r\n_too damn hot in here_. He peered at the thermostat; it said 68, but\r\nthe room was hot. He turned it down. _Check it out in the morning_, he\r\nthought. Couldn’t be working right. A drink and a shower would do it,\r\nall right. Then he could get back to sleep. Just one drink....\r\n\r\n“Maybe a brandy...?”\r\n\r\nIt took a moment to register--she meant for _her_. He looked down at\r\nher, grinning. “Hey!” he said, “Don’t you think one lush around here is\r\nenough?” She smiled and he leaned over, meaning to drop a quick kiss on\r\nher hair. Then it hit him again: the incredible fact of her presence,\r\nright there, in his house, in his bed ... the look and shape of her,\r\nthe curve of shoulder, the _aliveness_ just below her skin, the way\r\nher cheek curved with her smile ... smiling light in her eyes, and all\r\nfor him ... _for him_ ... even while the faint line of frowning ...\r\nfor him, too ... lingered above. The cloudy feel and fragrance of her\r\nhair, and the strange blend of scents on her skin; soap, grass, sex,\r\nsomething else, something sweet and delicious and way-back in memory.\r\n\r\n“Oh, _baby_!” he said and sat down to do an all-out job of kissing\r\nher. “Maybe I _don’t_ want that coffee--Nope!” He stood up, abruptly\r\naware of dried sweat on his face, in his hair. “The lady wants a drink,\r\nthat’s what she gets!”\r\n\r\nIn the kitchen, he got the bottle and two glasses and went straight\r\nback, not giving himself time for the quick one he would have had while\r\nhe mixed his coffee. He gave Lisa the bottle.\r\n\r\n“Pour me. I’ll be right back.”\r\n\r\n_And what the Hell do you think you’re proving?_ he jeered at himself\r\nas he turned on the shower. All the answers he could think of sounded\r\nmore like Phil Kutler’s brand of idiocy than like any of his own. He\r\nstepped impatiently out of the air blast and wrapped a towel around his\r\nstill-damp waist. _Well_, he thought, _any way you look at it, it’s\r\nyour own damn fault!_\r\n\r\nHe went out, took the glass Lee held out, and belted it fast. He filled\r\nit again, leaving the jug carefully on her table, not his own. Then he\r\nwalked around the bed and sat down, leaning against the headboard.\r\n\r\n_Sip it_, he told himself. Lisa leaned back beside him. He watched her\r\nbreasts move under the fullness of the thin nightgown: rising, as she\r\nsettled into place, and again as she raised her glass to her lips;\r\nfalling when she lowered it; shifting again when she turned to smile at\r\nhim. Her hair was freshly brushed, he saw, and her lips newly, lightly,\r\nrouged. There was a trace of perfume, too, that had not been there\r\nbefore--and the other smell, the special one he couldn’t quite place,\r\nwas lost under it. That was when he remembered something she’d said\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n“What’s with the morning bus?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“I have to be at the studio at ten. They’re taping the Bartok. Didn’t I\r\ntell you Hal called...?”\r\n\r\n“Yeah.” She _had_ told him. So okay. One more thing he didn’t remember.\r\nHe looked at her again. _What the Hell is that smell, anyway...?_\r\n\r\n“Lee....” He could sense her tension, her shrinking from what he was\r\ngoing to say. “I could go down too ... while we’re there ... we could\r\nsee about that license, you know?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, _Johnny_....” She paused, and because he did love her, he didn’t\r\nwait to make her say the rest.\r\n\r\n“Okay, doll. Listen....” _No good._ “Oh, Hell! Just don’t forget old\r\nJohnny did his best to make an honest woman out of you!” What the Hell\r\nshould _he_ care? If that’s how she wanted it....\r\n\r\nShe’d do anything for him, he knew. Anything--except marry him.\r\n\r\n_Okay!_ “Better get some sleep,” he said stiffly.\r\n\r\n“Mmmmm?” She emptied her glass, squashed out her cigarette, and slid\r\ndown on her pillow. Her hand hovered over the light switch while her\r\neyes questioned his.\r\n\r\n“Hand me the jug first,” he said. _Jesus! What a dream!_ He filled his\r\nglass again, setting the bottle down on his own table. The Hell with\r\nit. This time he needed it.\r\n\r\n“Jesus!” he said. “What a dream!” He laughed but it didn’t sound right.\r\n“You know how words can get all mixed up? _Choke_ and _artichoke_.\r\nFirst somebody’s pushing my head in, then they’re pulling me apart.\r\nJust like an artichoke--Christ! You know, you take off one leaf at a\r\ntime and dip it in butter and suck all the good part off and throw it\r\naway and pull off another one. Then you get down to the heart--just\r\nsitting there naked with all the leaves off, and you can’t even yell\r\nfor help, who the Hell’d ever hear an _artichoke_...?”\r\n\r\nThe goddam glass was empty. In the dark, the gurgling sound of pouring\r\nwas too loud.\r\n\r\n_The Hell with it!_\r\n\r\nLisa didn’t say anything.\r\n\r\nWell, what _could_ she say?\r\n\r\nWhat the Hell did he _want_ her to say?\r\n\r\n“There’s a moon tonight.” That’s what she said.\r\n\r\n“_Is_ there?”\r\n\r\nThe Hell with that too!\r\n\r\nShe shouldn’t have put on that perfume, he thought. Then, startled,\r\nhe found that his hand had gone out to the switch, and the wall that\r\nhad been milky glass before turned transparent. A near-full moon,\r\nheavy and low on the hilltops silhouetted the silvery birches and tall\r\npines: brought them so close he could feel the night breeze outside. He\r\nshivered, suddenly and uncontrollably, then remembered he’d turned the\r\nconditioner down before.\r\n\r\nHe reached for the panel light. Lee stirred in the bed, turned her back\r\nto him. _Fooled you!_ he thought with childish malice as he found the\r\nlight ... but no more childish than her back when she thought he was\r\ngoing for the bottle again, he decided. She moved again, and he saw she\r\nwas propped on an elbow, staring out. A current of air, from her back\r\nmaybe, carried that scent again--what in Hell was it?--An old smell, a\r\nhappy one, something from back when the Moon was a moon, and the man in\r\nthe moon was a joke, and not Chris, and Mars was an orangey spot in the\r\nsky, with no man in it anywhere....\r\n\r\nHis hand on the thermostat wavered. He stood up, dropped the towel, and\r\nshivered again.\r\n\r\n“Mind if I light the fire?” His voice sounded harsh in his ears. Hell\r\nwith that _too_....\r\n\r\n“Mmmmm....” That could have meant anything. He crossed the room, set\r\na match to the kindling and crouched at the fireplace, hugging the\r\nwarmth, while he watched flames leap up. Smell of pine burning, the\r\ncrackle of pitch, and then he remembered....\r\n\r\n_Vanilla!_\r\n\r\nA year ... more than a year now ... fourteen, fifteen months, that\r\nflavor, the scent of it on Lisa’s skin had been haunting him. _The\r\nsmell of vanilla!_ He laughed. She made an inquiring noise and he\r\nlooked around.\r\n\r\nThe moon was gone. The milky wall was black. His panel light glowed\r\nfor a moment, then she moved toward his side of the bed and stretched\r\nout her arm and the small glow died. Firelight leaped up, warming him\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\n“Hey, babe!” he said. “Oh, baby, I love _you_....”\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Moon--January, 1976_\r\n\r\nAcross the broad pock-marked face of the Moon, like blue-tinged boils\r\non chin, cheek, and forehead, three air-filled pressure domes gleamed\r\nin the hard rays of the naked sun.\r\n\r\nLargest and best-advertised of these was the joint military and\r\nastronomical observatory base of the United Nations World Peace\r\nControl and International Scientific Congress, nestled appropriately,\r\nor at least hopefully, inside a hilltop between the great dry “seas,”\r\n_Tranquilitatis_ and _Serenitatis_.\r\n\r\nFlanking it, at distances of about 800 miles each, were the\r\nLow-atmosphere and Low-temperature Laboratory of the Soviet Union of\r\nAsian Republics, and the All America Laboratory for the Investigation\r\nof Extra-Terrestrial Phenomena.\r\n\r\nIn both cases, the official designations of the smaller domes stated\r\nsomething less than the whole truth. Certainly, valuable scientific\r\nresearches into the properties and effects of near-zero and near-vacuum\r\nwere being pursued, eagerly, in the Red Dome. Just as surely,\r\nextra-terrestrial phenomena were being studied with active interest\r\ninside Dollars Dome. But the primary purposes of the two national labs\r\nwere somewhat less academic than the “pure” scientific research which,\r\nfor the most part, motivated the mixed crews of physicists, chemists,\r\nand astronomers in the big World Dome.\r\n\r\nThere was just one objective that could have induced either the USAA\r\nor the SUAR to finance and maintain experimental scientific bases more\r\nthan a quarter of a million miles out from under the quivering noses\r\nof, respectively, the Congressional Committees and the Politburo.\r\nIn his stronghold far out of sight beyond the Lunar Appenines, some\r\n1500 miles from the United States of All Americas Dome in Playfair\r\nCrater, Dr. Chen Lian-Tsu was occupied just as busily as was Dr.\r\nPeter Andrew Christensen in Dollars Dome with the application of\r\nknown physical, chemical, and astronomical data to the specific\r\npolitical-economic-imperial requirements of practical space-flight\r\n(tomorrow ... for _our_ side).\r\n\r\nIn the surface matters of dress and taste, preference in food, sport,\r\nand language, as well as national allegiance, the two men were worlds\r\napart. In the basics of personality both of them were so well suited to\r\nthe similar jobs they held that they were almost absurdly alike--even\r\nto the fact that neither (though both were in their mid-forties) had\r\never married. They were the kind of men who “marry their work”; but,\r\nunlike others _almost_ of their own type, both had avoided entanglement\r\nin arid marriages to which they could bring no real emotions. Their\r\npassions were already committed, wholly and without reserve, to the\r\ngreat dream of Space: of _man_ in Space.\r\n\r\nFor these two, the immediate physical world, the Earth, was already\r\nabandoned; and from the perspective of an inward life based in the\r\nuniverse-at-large, either one could see with tragic clarity the narrow\r\nlimits and uses of the old, little, world. They understood well enough\r\nthe need of _other_ men for competitive glories. They understood\r\nprofit-and-loss and its importance to other _other_-men. And they knew\r\nperfectly well that for the non-imperial realities of the UN or the ISC\r\nthere was _no_ economic, political, or social need for space flight.\r\n\r\nSo they had cause to be loyal nationals, each to his own. And each\r\ntook care, as he had all his life, that no breath of suspicion sully\r\nhis name or place in doubt (by a wary government) his suitability for\r\nthe work he had to do. And if on rare and most private occasions,\r\neither one of them thought briefly, wistfully, of the advantages of a\r\nunited approach to the Dream--he knew well enough that for _other_ men,\r\nSpace was no dream at all, but a prize enhanced--if not created--by\r\ncompetition. The isolation, security measures, and endless duplication\r\nof research and planning were, _realistically_, necessary.\r\n\r\nThis attitude was of course easier to maintain on the Moon than\r\non Earth. Fifteen hundred miles of rugged lunar terrain, and the\r\nexigencies of rocket fuel economy, kept physical contact between the\r\ndomes down to a minimum. Two hundred fifty thousand miles of empty\r\nspace, and the economics of human existence on the Moon, kept political\r\ncontact with the home governments down to a minimum too: on the Moon,\r\na really rigid security could be sustained with almost no worry about\r\ninfiltration, no possible worry about associations, and no pettyfogging\r\nannoyances from suspicious, ambitious policemen or politicians.\r\n\r\nThe prevailing state of by-mutual-consent _laissez-faire_ isolation\r\nwas such an inherent fabric that Dr. Chen and Dr. Christensen had\r\nnever even met personally. There had simply been no occasion. For that\r\nmatter, up till the day of Johnny Wendt’s return, the men on either\r\nstaff who had even _seen_ the other dome could be counted on two hands;\r\nnone had ever been further inside the other than the landing lock--and\r\nthat only on the occasions of the inevitable minor emergencies that\r\ncalled for humane sharing of survival (_not_ scientific) equipment.\r\nWith the exception of these instances, USAA ships made it a point not\r\neven to fly inside a line-of-sight of Plato Crater, and Red pilots\r\nstayed equally clear of Playfair.\r\n\r\nThe only modification of this “natural security” status that had\r\noccurred between the times that the two domes went up, in ’69, and\r\nthe orbiting of the _Moon Messenger_ in ’74, was when an outraged AA\r\nCongress learned that the Reds had succeeded in sending a ship to Mars\r\nwithout any previous knowledge at Dollars Dome.\r\n\r\nBut even then, no real attempt was made at an Intelligence network\r\noperating directly between the domes; it just wasn’t worth the\r\nwaste of oxygen on a Dome resident doing less than a full-time job\r\nof research or development. The money authorized as a result of\r\nthe indignant Congressional Investigation went into tightening and\r\nimproving existing infiltrations on Relay Station, the 400-mile Earth\r\nsatellite, and at World Dome.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, counter-espionage was strengthened correspondingly--and\r\nwith just as little effect on the Red Dome itself as the USAA move had\r\non life at Playfair. Not till the orbiting of the _Messenger_, the\r\ngiant wheel of space that rode the great ellipse from a 12,000-mile\r\norbit around Earth out to the convenient dropping-distance of the\r\nMoon, carrying shuttle-ships of all three domes, was there the kind of\r\nintergrouping that breeds espionage. In eighteen months of operation,\r\nthe _Messenger_ had already started to acquire an aura of the sort of\r\nglamour that once permeated Istanbul, Paris, Lisbon, and Rome, complete\r\nwith agents, counter-agents, and double agents.\r\n\r\nCongressional apprehension had increased sharply when it was finally\r\nadmitted, less than a year after the _Messenger_ went up, that the\r\nwhole spectrum of psychogenic and psychosomatic ailments plaguing\r\nthe dwellers on the Moon could be relieved by nothing less than a\r\nmonth-long quarterly rest leave on Earth. For a time, there was even\r\ntalk of “rest camps” and “recreation centers” where top-secret Moon\r\nDome scientists could take their rehabilitation leaves on Earth. But\r\npublic distaste for the idea prevailed--and the original Congressional\r\nfears dissolved almost out of shape when, 32 months after its\r\nunheralded departure, the _Lenin_ failed to make its scheduled return.\r\nBy that time--Christmas, 1973--the _Colombo_ was six months out, en\r\nroute to Mars. And when a strenuous Intelligence effort confirmed that\r\nthe Soviet ship was really lost (and not just secretly arrived), Dr.\r\nChristensen did not hesitate to remind the genial Congressmen that he\r\n_had_ Told Them So, three years earlier, when he explained his failure\r\nto alert anyone to the possibility of a Red Mars-trip in the spring of\r\n’71.\r\n\r\nThe fact was he had assumed his opposite number would wait, as he\r\nwas doing, for the next A-orbit date, in June ’73, so as to gain the\r\nadvantages that might accrue from the results of the ISC Observatory’s\r\nstudies during the close Mars opposition of ’71. _After_ the fact, he\r\nremembered that Chen had been faced with an extra intangible that had\r\nnot troubled him: the history of Soviet “firsts.” From Sputnik I on up\r\nthrough the first Moon-landing, SUAR (or USSR) rocket men had been\r\nfirst. The Party Chairman desired to keep it that way--so the _Lenin_\r\nleft first.\r\n\r\nBut the _Colombo_ came back.\r\n\r\nIt came back with no news of the Red ship.\r\n\r\nAnd it came back with one man instead of two.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dollars Dome--January 12, 1976_\r\n\r\nJohnny Wendt was the one who came back.\r\n\r\nThey met him with cheers and rejoicing, welcomed him home with\r\nmusic and medals and speeches on worldwide video beamed from the\r\nbunting-draped central square of the United States Moon Dome.\r\n\r\nThey sent relays of shuttles up to the big ship, with fuel and\r\nship-to-base radio and an ace pilot, encased in the newest and safest\r\nof protective gear, to guide her down. The first shuttle took Johnny\r\noff, while official cameras recorded for all time the opening of the\r\nhistoric lock and the return of mankind’s first space-traveler to\r\nTerra’s Moon.\r\n\r\nThe cameras kept grinding inside the shuttle while Major Wendt was\r\nbathed under batteries of ultraviolet, and a medic in Geiger-suit\r\nlooked down his throat, checked his heartbeat and pulse and lungs,\r\nlooked at his insides under a fluoroscope, took smears and samples\r\nand ran off fast lab checks--then smiled and handed him a brand-new\r\nuniform, one they could trust to harbor no alien virus or unknown seed.\r\n\r\nThe camera followed him out of the shuttle, into the dome lock. Another\r\ncamera, and the live video scanners, picked him up inside the dome. But\r\nin the lock, for the sixty-nine seconds it took to bleed air, no record\r\nwas made. And Chris was there, alone, to meet him first.\r\n\r\nHe pumped Johnny’s hand, grinning with triumph. “_Man!_” he said. “We\r\nmade it, man!”\r\n\r\nThen his grin faded. “_You_ did,” he corrected. “Johnny--what happened\r\nto Doug?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” Wendt said.\r\n\r\nThe inner door opened. Cameras swung into action. General Harbridge\r\nstepped forward and shook Johnny’s hand.\r\n\r\n“Congratulations--Colonel!” he said, and pinned the new eagles onto the\r\nnew uniform. But when they were under way, out of range for a moment of\r\naudio pickups, he asked anxiously, “Wendt--what happened to Laughlin?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” Johnny said, “sir.” Then, wearily: “Everything I know\r\nis in the Log, sir. I brought it down with me. I figured you’d want it.\r\nThe doctor’s got it.”\r\n\r\nHarbridge nodded and said nothing more. But his smile when he led\r\nJohnny up to the platform on the Mall was a shade forced. And as soon\r\nas he decently could, he whispered a word to an aide and ducked out,\r\nleaving the assembled Dignitaries to welcome the space hero home.\r\n\r\nNobody missed him. The Ambassadors and Senators pinned a whole chestful\r\nof medals on the new uniform, and found a few for Dr. Christensen and\r\nhis staff too. Then the VIPs and the cameras followed the new colonel\r\nto his first meal. The staff conference room had been turned into a\r\nbanquet hall. Johnny was toasted and feted and fed.\r\n\r\nThey asked him to speak.\r\n\r\nHe stood up and looked at them all and his face was grim. Chris,\r\nsitting next to him, knowing him almost too well from five years of\r\ntraining and planning before the trip, stood up quickly beside him and\r\ngrabbed the mike.\r\n\r\n“Boy’s all choked up,” he said.\r\n\r\nWhile the room laughed he managed to cover the mike for a moment. “Just\r\ntell ’em thanks, Johnny.”\r\n\r\nWhen it was quiet again, Wendt looked around, indecisive, looked down\r\nat Chris and grinned painfully. “I’m not much of a speaker,” he said.\r\n“I ... Hell, I’m glad to be home!”\r\n\r\n“Thanks,” Chris said.\r\n\r\nWhen it all broke up, Chris took him up to his room.\r\n\r\n“Thanks?”\r\n\r\n“For keeping your mouth shut. Whatever’s bugging you....”\r\n\r\n“You seen Harbridge yet?”\r\n\r\n“No. He took off during the speeches.”\r\n\r\n“I know.” Johnny smiled the new one-sided smile again. “He went to read\r\nthe Log.”\r\n\r\nPete Christensen looked at the stranger who had been a friend. “All\r\nright,” he said. “What the hell happened?”\r\n\r\n“It’s in the Log, Chris--all _I_ know about it. Ask Harbridge.” He\r\npaused. “Hey,” he said, “You got something up here to drink?”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEverything on the _Colombo_ was tested and touched (and in some cases\r\ntasted too) by teams of two: a scientist and an Intelligence officer.\r\nJohnny had done his job all right, and Doug apparently had completed\r\nhis before he disappeared. The boxes and bottles, tubes and jars,\r\nnotebooks and tape recorders and camera films were all filled and\r\nfiled, packed with the answers to centuries of human questioning.\r\n\r\nYes, there had once been intelligent life on Mars.\r\n\r\nNo, it was there no more.\r\n\r\nThere were pictures of crumbling ruins, a very few carefully packed\r\nfossil remains, atmosphere samples, terrain maps and photographs, wind\r\ncharts, rock samples, analyses, assays, and boxes of “Mars-Earth,”\r\nfrom seven different “canals,” alive with one-celled life-forms that\r\nmade planet-life possible in the dry air above ground. The record\r\nof Laughlin’s work on the symbiosis between the moisture-retaining\r\n“Mars-bugs” and the sparse photo-sensitive lichen of the “canals” were\r\nthere too, neat and in order, properly filed away and labeled in Doug\r\nLaughlin’s hand. And Johnny had finished the job; he’d brought back\r\nall the pictures and records and readings, the answers they sent him\r\nto get. Nothing was missing, not a thing out of place--nothing but\r\nLaughlin himself, one specially designed sand-caterpillar-tractor, two\r\noxygen cylinders, and the four pages torn out of the Log.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDaily, sometimes hourly, press releases were beamed down to Earth,\r\ntelling it all to a waiting world--all but the last bit, about the Log.\r\n\r\nThe teams of two went through the ship of space.\r\n\r\nThe semanticists, psychers, and medics went to work on the Hero, and on\r\nthe Log he brought back.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe last entry before the torn-out sheets was in Laughlin’s hand,\r\ndated April 26, 1975, roughly a month before scheduled takeoff for\r\nthe return trip to Earth: a routine report on routine existence,\r\nnoting temperature, wind, and moisture readings; cataloguing the men’s\r\nwhereabouts and accomplishments during the twenty-four-and-a-half hours\r\nthat made one Martian day; listing lab findings of the past several\r\ndays. Nothing remarkable in any way--except that it broke off in\r\nmid-sentence at the end of the page.\r\n\r\nNo clues or hints, no intimations, no cryptic allusions to Doug’s\r\nimpending act--not in that entry or any previous one. Presumably,\r\nthe missing pages _did_ hold some such references; but they were\r\ngone--presumably wherever Laughlin himself had gone.\r\n\r\nHandwriting experts, called in by the Psych staff, agreed that\r\nLaughlin’s last entry showed signs of emotional upset. But both men’s\r\nhandwriting showed a slow increase of tension throughout the Log,\r\nmounting sharply after the landing on Mars, and more swiftly again\r\nduring the month since the sampling and mapping were finished, until\r\nthe day of Laughlin’s departure.\r\n\r\nThe next entry, after the missing four pages, was Wendt’s, on April\r\n29, at 1816 hours: “Laughlin gone out alone without notice. No signals\r\nfrom sand cat. I do not believe he plans to return. Tire tracks visible\r\nfrom cargo lock point N39W. Going out in heli now, no flight plan, will\r\nfollow tracks. Carrying four hours fuel, standard 24-hr oxy-water etc.\r\nFigure two hours tot. flight time, unless I find him in trouble. Tape\r\n237, a-6.”\r\n\r\nThe next notation, at 2129 hours, said briefly: “No luck. Lost tracks\r\nin hills. Saw what looked like sand cat dust trail at N32W on other\r\nside. Going out again now, with six hours fuel. Oxy-water, 12 hrs. Tape\r\n237, a-9.”\r\n\r\nThen: “4/30/75, 0110--Dust storm, 50 mi. past previous flight limit.\r\nN32W dust cloud could have been storm approaching. Any tracks will be\r\ncovered now. Will commence standard search pattern, 3-hr. flights, when\r\nstorm passes.”\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later, at 0048: “Thought I’d catch a nap till storm let\r\nup, but might as well get the story down, as much as I know, before I\r\nforget anything. Doug left the ship sometime between 2315 (approx) last\r\nnight and 0650 this morning (Mars-time. eq: 1108 and 1754, 4/29/75).\r\nMost likely he left just before I woke up, say between--”\r\n\r\nHere, the Mars time had been written in and scratched out, and Earth\r\ntime (which was Standard Log procedure), written in instead.\r\n\r\n“--1745, say, and 1754. This is hunch mostly, I think the sound of the\r\nairlock might have been what woke me, since I did not actually go to\r\nsleep till an hour or more after 1108, when I went to my bunk, and I\r\nwas surprised to see the time when I woke. Usually sleep longer. Was\r\nnot aware of what woke me (if anything) at first, and did not take\r\nspecial notice of Doug’s absence. Assumed he was sleeping. Got dressed,\r\nstarted making breakfast, then noticed panel signal that a sand cat\r\nwas out--but no beeps coming in. Checked Doug’s bunk, which was empty.\r\nChecked Log, for his trip plan. Found missing pages. Checked time; then\r\n1812. Found dust cloud that _could_ have been cat trail on scope at\r\nN37W. Proceeded on first search, as noted, at 1816.\r\n\r\n“Throughout first search, I kept helmet radio tuned for automatic\r\nsignals from cat, except for a five minute waveband search every half\r\nhour after trying helmet-radio calls. No signals received.\r\n\r\n“Storm seems to be mostly past now. Will now commence search pattern.”\r\nFuel and oxy-water data and signal tape reference numbers followed.\r\n\r\nLaughlin had then been gone at least seven hours. Longer trips than\r\nthat had been made before--but not by either man alone. Nor were\r\n_any_ trips--prior to this one--made singly by either partner without\r\nadvance arrangements. If one of them went out alone, the other was\r\nrequired, by operating procedures established beforehand, to stand by\r\nand maintain continuous radio contact. When they left ship together,\r\nthe same continuous radio contact was maintained, one-way, and\r\nautomatically taped on board the ship. Both sand cats, the helicopter,\r\nand the small plane were equipped with radio transmitters that operated\r\nautomatically, sending signal directions, as long as the vehicle was\r\nin operation. There was no switchoff on the devices, and there was a\r\nsecondary system designed to cut in if the primary were damaged in any\r\nway.\r\n\r\nNo direction signals had been recorded from Laughlin’s cat at any time.\r\nWendt’s immediate reaction, written before his first search, “I do not\r\nbelieve he plans to return,” had appeared filled with sinister import\r\nwhen the log was first examined. On consideration, the quick conclusion\r\nseemed a natural one, in view of Doug’s failure to inform Johnny of his\r\ntrip plans, or to file a route plan, plus the absence of any direction\r\nsignals from the cat (which pointed toward deliberate dismantling of\r\nthe automatic equipment), and, finally, Johnny’s discovery of the\r\nmissing pages in the log book.\r\n\r\nThe next entry, made several hours later, debated the advisability\r\nof further search. The first effort had turned up no trail of any\r\nkind. The rule against simultaneous departures from line-of-sight had\r\nto be considered. Everything pointed to one extreme likelihood that\r\nLaughlin’s departure had been planned and purposeful, and that no\r\namount of searching would be rewarded. Nevertheless, Johnny continued\r\nto search for five more days, two or three flights a day, until the\r\nsearch pattern was finished, the flight coordinates adding up to a\r\ncircle whose radius represented a narrow margin of safety above the\r\nflight limits imposed for one-man trips.\r\n\r\nThe final entry on the search was brief:\r\n\r\n“I do not believe there is a possibility that Laughlin is still alive.\r\nHe did not take any extra oxygen cylinders with him. At minimum usage,\r\nthe two standard tanks in the cat, if full when he started, would\r\nhave been stretched to 95 hours. He has now been gone from the ship\r\nfor at least 127 hours. I have seen no sign of him, or of any ship’s\r\nequipment, or of any trail he might have left, on any flight since the\r\nsecond one.”\r\n\r\nThere were no further entries except for routine daily temperature\r\nand atmosphere reading, until the one that gave the calculations for\r\ntakeoff and homeward orbit. Doug Laughlin’s name was not mentioned\r\nagain, nor was any reference to him made. No opinion was volunteered as\r\nto why he should have left the ship.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey went back to Johnny again.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” he kept saying.\r\n\r\n“Why did you tear those pages out of the Log?”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t.”\r\n\r\n“Who did?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know.”\r\n\r\n“You think Laughlin did it?”\r\n\r\n“I know _I_ didn’t.”\r\n\r\n“Why would he do a thing like that?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know.”\r\n\r\n“What made you think he wasn’t coming back?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. I just thought so.”\r\n\r\n“How did it happen that you weren’t aware of his going?”\r\n\r\n“It’s all in the Log.”\r\n\r\n“Now look, Colonel Wendt ...” (or “Johnny” or “son,” depending on\r\nwho did the questioning) “... you must have had _some_ idea _why_ he\r\nwent....”\r\n\r\nSilence, usually. If the interrogator was friendly, a quiet curse.\r\n\r\n“_What happened to Laughlin?_”\r\n\r\n“Search me,” he said.\r\n\r\nSo they did. They searched him with “truth” drugs which only confirmed\r\nwhat he’d told them. He did not know what had happened to Doug\r\nLaughlin. He did not know what had happened to the missing pages of the\r\nbook. And he had no knowledge of having had anything to do with the\r\nloss of the man or of the material from the Log.\r\n\r\nMeantime, reporters and commentators, interviewers and feature-writers\r\nfrom every corner of Earth fraternized restlessly in a well-appointed\r\nsuite at Mexcity’s best hotel where a Public Relations man in Space\r\nAcademy brass buttons smilingly poured drinks, dealt out freshly-inked\r\nmimeographed sheets from a cardboard box, and made sure the free-lunch\r\nwas kept replenished.\r\n\r\nSecurity would be lifted, and Colonel Wendt would be personally\r\navailable, as soon as the ship was completely unloaded, he told the\r\nreporters.\r\n\r\nHow long would that be?\r\n\r\nWell, it was hard to say....\r\n\r\nSoon....\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mexcity, U.S.A.A.--February, 1976_\r\n\r\nThey brought him back to Earth, on the next downswing the Messenger\r\nmade. Security would have preferred to keep him on the Moon till they\r\nhad something--anything--on Laughlin, or on the missing Log pages at\r\nleast. But the M. I. squad had to have expert consultants and some\r\npsych equipment which Dr. Christensen irritably, arbitrarily, would\r\nnot grant shuttle space. And the Psych man attached to the team was\r\ninsisting they’d never get anything out of John Wendt till they let him\r\ngo home, back to Earth.\r\n\r\nSo, twenty days after the feasting and medals, Colonel Wendt and an\r\nescort of nine guards and questioners left Dollars Dome. Five days\r\nlater, they landed on a snow-swept concrete prairie in the Andes. The\r\nlanding and clearance routine seemed to take an absurdly long time;\r\nit was after dark when a plain helicopter finally left the spaceport,\r\ncarrying Johnny and two “bodyguards” from Security. By the time the\r\nreporters got wind of the hero’s arrival, he was already installed in\r\nhis prison-of-honor--a whole floor of luxury in the tower penthouse\r\nof the same hotel where, nineteen floors down, in the pressroom, free\r\nlunch and free drinks were still passing around.\r\n\r\nThey showed Johnny through the place and explained politely, very\r\npleasantly, that it would be best if he stayed in his rooms for a\r\nwhile. Adjustment period. Psych tests. All that sort of thing. Then\r\nthey posted a very polite, pleasant, guard at each door to keep\r\nunauthorized visitors out--and Johnny in. Just as politely, and very\r\nfirmly, they told the clamoring press:\r\n\r\n“Not yet....”\r\n\r\nWhen the records of the trip had been fully examined, when all the\r\nfilms and test-tubes and tapes and sample-boxes had been classified and\r\nexamined, Security could be lifted completely....\r\n\r\nHow long would that be?\r\n\r\nWell, it was hard to say....\r\n\r\nSoon. Very soon....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne after another, different men of eminence in different schools\r\nof psychiatric practice came up to the hotel penthouse. Johnny met\r\nthem politely and listened--at first with interest, and then with\r\nindifference--and agreed, passively, to the succession of exhumative\r\ntechniques they proposed.\r\n\r\nThey explained to him how a man’s memory worked, how the brain stores\r\nand holds memories, how a memory block occurs, how the subconscious\r\nmind can dominate a person’s consciousness. Johnny nodded patiently,\r\nand remembered nothing more than before.\r\n\r\n“You can remember if you want to,” one man said.\r\n\r\n“Yeah.” Johnny grinned, and looked embarrassed. “But what about if I\r\n_don’t_ want to?”\r\n\r\nThey told him that the information he withheld--from them as well as\r\nfrom himself--would probably make a difference of years in sending out\r\nanother ship.\r\n\r\n“Okay,” he said, with the same one-sided grin, “Do yourselves a favor.\r\n_Don’t_ find out.”\r\n\r\nHe made it very clear that he himself fully intended to spend the\r\nremainder of his days on Earth; and that he was quite convinced any man\r\nin his right mind would do likewise.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPete Christensen came down to see him. Chris was a friend, twice: not\r\njust Johnny’s friend, but Doug’s too. It had been his job to choose the\r\nmen for that trip. The training and planning that had prepared them had\r\nbeen by his orders, and much of the time at his hands. And they had all\r\nshared the dream....\r\n\r\nHe said, “Listen, Johnny, _we’ve got to know_!” He talked about\r\nCongress and the new appropriations bill, about the dream that was\r\ndying in a morass of reaction and funk; and added, “There’s nothing in\r\nyour Log about the _Lenin_ either.”\r\n\r\n“We never saw it.”\r\n\r\n“All right, you never saw it. So now you come back, without Doug, and\r\nsomething happened, but you won’t talk....”\r\n\r\n“Chris, if I _knew_ anything....”\r\n\r\n“Okay, but you know these Mexcity characters, four pages missing from\r\nthat damn Log, Doug missing, the _Lenin_ missing. And now you not only\r\n_won’t_ talk, but what they’re saying is, you _can’t_. You see what I\r\nmean? Christ, you read enough science fiction and horror stuff to see\r\nthe picture. And you can believe me, they’ve got lobbies working nights\r\npainting the pic. Not just in Mexcity, either. You should see the\r\nSunday supplement trash on tri-di!”\r\n\r\n“I’ve seen it. What do you mean--lobbies?”\r\n\r\n“The Undersea Dome crowd, Arctic reclamation. Half a dozen of ’em.\r\nMostly the Undersea bunch, though.”\r\n\r\n“Undersea? I thought that bunch was so rich they didn’t _bother_ with\r\nCongress?”\r\n\r\nChris laughed. “You think that means they don’t want public money to\r\nwork with?”\r\n\r\nWendt shook his head and grinned: a nice young boyish grin, rueful,\r\namused.\r\n\r\n“Okay, look,” Chris said. “They’ve got a bill going in now to cut _all_\r\nSpace money outside of routine Lab funds, only for maintenance, see?,\r\nand some work on the stuff you brought back. But no new ship. Not even\r\na refit for the old bird. No Venus job. You know what that means?”\r\n\r\nJohnny nodded. He still smiled; but now it had twisted to the new\r\none-sided kind.\r\n\r\n“Damn it, they’re _scared_,” Chris said. “And damn it, you scared ’em!\r\nJohnny, you know even pressure from a group like Undersea wouldn’t work\r\nif those guys didn’t know all the folks back home were scared right out\r\nof their pants too?”\r\n\r\n“That’s right.”\r\n\r\nChris looked at him, shook his head. “What the _hell_ is out there?” he\r\nasked. “_What made you feel this way?_”\r\n\r\nWendt stood up and paced the length of the big room and back again.\r\n“Okay!” he said. “You want to know what’s out there? I’ll tell you.\r\nAll right, I’ll tell you, and you can have a good laugh and forget all\r\nabout it. Forget it until you manage to wheedle some more dough out of\r\nCongress, and send some other poor goof out there. Then if he gets back\r\nalive and tells you the same thing, you might even start to believe it.\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you what’s out there: _God_, that’s what. Mars is heaven,\r\nsee--just like it said in the story--only different--and God lives\r\nthere. So if you know some guy holy enough to meet up with the Hot Shot\r\nin person, send him on out. Otherwise, you better forget the whole\r\nthing.”\r\n\r\nChris stood up stiffly. “Okay,” he said. “I know when I’m licked.”\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter?” Johnny said bitterly. “You’re not laughing. Don’t\r\nyou think it’s funny?”\r\n\r\n“No. Maybe I haven’t got any sense of humor. You know how us dedicated\r\nsouls are. Anyhow, the joke is on me.”\r\n\r\nIt was only after Chris left that Johnny realized the older man hadn’t\r\nbelieved that he meant it. _Score one for the psychers_, he thought; at\r\nleast they could tell when he was not kidding. _They’d_ believe that\r\none all right: believe that he meant it; what would bug _them_ was\r\ntrying to figure out what he meant _by_ it.\r\n\r\nWhich was a good question too, when you thought of it....\r\n\r\nIt was some hours later that he realized he couldn’t answer that one\r\nfor himself--because it wasn’t really his idea to start with. It was\r\nsomething Doug had said, in that bad month, the last month, before he\r\nwent....\r\n\r\nOkay, he thought grimly, _let’s see how long it takes for them to dig_\r\nthat _out_....\r\n\r\nBy that time, it was a game with him, a bitter game, to see how much he\r\ncould throw the psychers off without actually telling a lie they could\r\nspot.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mexcity--March, 1976_\r\n\r\nPhil Kutler would never have gotten a crack at the Wendt case, except\r\nthat none of the big men in the field had gotten anywhere, and that\r\nJohnny and Phil happened to have gone to school together. And when\r\nthey examined the tapes that carried a record of every word Johnny\r\nWendt had spoken in his luxury-prison, they realized that the most\r\nrevealing thing anybody had gotten out of him--if only they knew what\r\nit revealed--was his bitter little speech to Pete Christensen. So they\r\nasked Kutler to come from New York, and sent him up, not quite sure\r\nhimself whether he was there as friend or doctor.\r\n\r\nJohnny greeted him suspiciously. They ordered some beer, and yakked for\r\na while about things they’d done and places they’d been since they saw\r\neach other five-six years before. Mostly Phil’s places and people and\r\nthings; Johnny found he could damn near enjoy himself when someone else\r\ndid the talking.\r\n\r\nFinally Phil said, “Look, I’m a doctor. You know why I’m here. I got a\r\nbig pep talk downstairs about all the stuff I’m supposed to find out\r\nfor the sake of Progress and the Human Race, and a pile of high-minded\r\nstuff like that....\r\n\r\n“Don’t get me wrong, man. I’ve got nothing against noble abstractions.\r\nI’m all for the human race, and I guess progress is real peachy too.\r\nBut like I said, I’m a doctor. We all get our kicks different ways,\r\nand I get mine curing sick people. And man, you’re sick. Maybe I’m not\r\nsupposed to come out and tell you like that, but it’s sticking out all\r\nover....”\r\n\r\n“Sure, sure,” Johnny said quickly. “How do you want to do it? Sometimes\r\nthey want me to lie down. Sometimes I’m supposed to shut my eyes. One\r\nguy brought up a little tank of CO₂, and there was one with some\r\nvitamin guk, and they tried scop, or something like it, a couple of\r\ntimes and--”\r\n\r\n“Okay, chum.” Phil stood up and stuck out his hand. “I’ll tell ’em it\r\nlooks promising and maybe they’ll let me come and see you again some\r\ntime.”\r\n\r\n“Not on your life,” Johnny said. “They’ve got every word of this down\r\non their magic spy rays.”\r\n\r\n“Oh?” Kutler looked around the room curiously, then with visible\r\nirritation, and finally with explosive fury: “The stupid brassbound\r\nidiots! What in God’s name are they trying to do to you? Take a guy\r\nwith the most obvious case of exposure fears any half-assed medic ever\r\ndiagnosed, and sit him in a great big glass house with the whole world\r\nlooking in....” He broke off abruptly. “Well, they got _me_ on record\r\nnow, too,” he said quietly.\r\n\r\n“You mean they sent you up here without telling you that?” Johnny asked.\r\n\r\n“How come they told _you_?”\r\n\r\nJohnny shook his head. “They didn’t. I just figured it. Things the\r\nwrong people know about. Stuff like that. Yeah, sure, I know, it could\r\nall be--what do you call it?--‘projection?’ Eyes and ears in the wall?\r\nStuff like that?”\r\n\r\nKutler looked at him thoughtfully. “Have you asked anyone about it?”\r\n\r\n“Hell, no!”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“What difference would it make? Like you said, I’m in a glass box\r\nanyhow. Maybe I felt good knowing something they didn’t know I knew....\r\nWell I shot _that_ wad, now, didn’t I?”\r\n\r\n“Yeah.” Kutler sat back in the soft chair, picked up his beer,\r\nstretched his legs, and watched Johnny pacing from piano to windows\r\nand back. “Yeah, you sure did. If you’re right, then they already have\r\nit....”\r\n\r\n“What did you mean, ‘exposure fears’?” Johnny broke in. He stood\r\ntensely, half way from the wall to the piano. “Don’t you think I _want_\r\nto get out of here?”\r\n\r\n“Huh? Oh, no. I meant--just what you said. ‘Eyes and ears in the wall.’\r\nOnly now I’m not sure which came first, the chicken or the egg--Listen,\r\nJohn, do you want to find out? Right now?” He got up and went to the\r\nphone, but he did not pick it up, waiting for Johnny’s answer.\r\n\r\n“I don’t give a damn one way or the other!”\r\n\r\n“Oh?” He took his hand off the phone, half-turned away. “Of course if\r\nyou don’t think you’d feel better knowing you’re right, then maybe\r\nyou’d just rather not take a risk of being wrong. Oh, hell! Who’s\r\nkidding whom anyway?” He turned angrily back and picked up the phone.\r\n“_I_ want to know.”\r\n\r\n“Okay, okay. Go ahead. I told you I don’t care....”\r\n\r\n\r\n_New York City--March-May, 1976_\r\n\r\nThat was the beginning. Kutler came up every day for a while, just\r\nto talk. He was the only personal visitor Johnny would admit; and he\r\nhimself refused to consider the visits professional in the bugged\r\napartment. By the end of the week, a compromise agreement had been\r\nreached all around. Kutler had him for a patient, and his patient would\r\ncome, like any other, to the doctor’s office for treatment. Johnny was\r\nmoved to a new hotel penthouse in New York.\r\n\r\nThree months of probing, plus Wendt’s agreement, finally, to the use\r\nof hypnotic recall technique, told them what they didn’t want to know:\r\nwhich was, essentially, that they already knew just as much as he did.\r\n\r\nOh, they gained a few details, but none of any importance. The fact\r\nremained simply that Doug Laughlin had walked out of the ship one day\r\nwhile Johnny was asleep. He hadn’t come back. He had taken nothing\r\nwith him except what he wore on his back, and the food and equipment\r\nnormally kept in the sand cat, plus, presumably, four pages out of the\r\nLog. Nowhere in the detailed memories of the days before Laughlin’s\r\ndisappearance, or the months after, was there slightest evidence that\r\nWendt had torn those sheets out, nor that he had even read them at any\r\ntime. Nowhere was there anything to relate Laughlin’s disappearance,\r\nor the mutilation of the Log, to the Soviet ship, _Lenin_. Nowhere was\r\nthere any shred of cause to believe that either of the two who went out\r\nin _Colombo_ had seen or heard anything at all of the other ship.\r\n\r\nThe objective facts of the case, as far as Johnny Wendt knew them,\r\nor ever had known them, were exactly as stated before. But, adding\r\nKutler’s findings to those of the men who had preceded him, and to the\r\nevidence of conversations on tape, they could at least form an opinion\r\non which it was just barely possible to rest a theory.\r\n\r\nAs far as Johnny himself was concerned, the final official verdict was\r\nthat he was guilty of nothing but guilt itself. The two ideas to which\r\nthe guilt was most frequently attached were--\r\n\r\na) the obvious possibility that he had in some way been personally,\r\ndirectly, responsible for Laughlin’s death: and\r\n\r\nb) the completely suppressed (except under hypnotic recall) fear of\r\nremembering that for a time, before Laughlin’s disappearance, a strong\r\nhomosexual attraction had apparently been developing between the two\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nIn neither case was there any reason to believe that Johnny’s\r\nself-accusations were based on anything other than fearful fantasies.\r\n\r\nAs to what had actually happened to Doug--it was still anyone’s\r\nguess. The best guess seemed to be that he was suffering from the\r\nsame developing fear of inversion that had afflicted Wendt; that he\r\nhad been even more horrified at the idea than Johnny was, and had\r\nchosen deliberate suicide in preference to involuntary surrender to\r\n“degeneracy”; and that, perhaps, he had written something into those\r\nfour pages that he thought might be revealing, and so removed them\r\nbefore he left.\r\n\r\nIt hung together. As a theory, it made sense. The only trouble was,\r\nif the theory was correct, then the wrong man had come back. The same\r\npsychiatrists who formulated the theories swore up and down that\r\npsych-tests on both men before the trip made it absurd to think that\r\nLaughlin would have reacted in this way. If _any_one did, it should\r\nhave been Wendt; and that would not have made much _more_ sense.\r\n\r\nBut the theory was all they had. The only way they would ever know more\r\nwas to go back and find out--and the very fact that they _didn’t_ know\r\nmore was enough to whittle down the chances of going back, any time\r\nsoon, almost to the vanishing point.\r\n\r\nThe great All American public was scared.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Earth--May, 1976-May, 1977_\r\n\r\nWhen they were satisfied that Johnny had told all he knew, they let\r\nhim go home--which was no place in particular. He didn’t like having a\r\nlot of people around, so he skipped the big whirl he could have had in\r\nNew York or Washington or Buenos Aires. He bummed around as quietly as\r\npossible for a while; found that liquor helped, and women, mostly, did\r\nnot; set himself up as a kind of roving consultant in engineering and\r\ndesign, and found that work could help, too, for short spells. If it\r\nhappened to catch his interest.\r\n\r\nGetting jobs was easy; the name of Johnny Wendt was enough, even though\r\nhis qualifications could be equalled by any number of other bright\r\nyoung cybernetics engineers. But _wanting_ to get jobs was tougher.\r\nHe had all the money he’d ever need; and if he needed more, after\r\nthe life-time pension and bonus pay, there were always advertisers\r\nclamoring for his endorsements, and manufacturers for the use of his\r\nname.\r\n\r\nHe could get money, jobs, liquor, women. But what he wanted, he\r\ncouldn’t get, and didn’t even know a name for.\r\n\r\nThe therapy had helped. But not enough. He knew for a fact that he\r\nhadn’t killed Doug; but between fact and belief there is a world of\r\ndifference. He knew, too, that he hadn’t--done any of the things he’d\r\nbeen afraid even to think about, before the therapy. Now he could\r\nthink about them; and did. Now he knew what he’d wanted to do. Now he\r\ncouldn’t forget.\r\n\r\nAfter a while he met Lisa, or rather, met her again. He didn’t really\r\nremember her from before, but she remembered him. When he first went up\r\nto the Moon, one of the beglamoured selectees from the Space Academy,\r\nto train for the Mars flight, she was one of a crowd of worshipful\r\nand willing girls--young actresses, models, dance students--the whole\r\ngang dated. In the intervening years, she had made a name for herself\r\non world-wide tri-di--which would have disqualified her from Johnny’s\r\ncynical viewpoint (“The higher they get, the easier they fall,” he was\r\nfond of saying just then), except that he met her quite unsuspiciously\r\nduring her twice-a-week stints as dance-therapist for a group therapy\r\nclinic of Kutler’s.\r\n\r\nOddly, she had remained just as worshipful, and just as willing. And\r\nJohnny found, after a bit, that he was reassured by some special warmth\r\nin her willingness; later he was fascinated by the calm pleasure she\r\ntook in knowing that a million people were watching her when she danced\r\non tri-di. Later still, when fascination and reassurance progressed far\r\nenough, he found at least a partial answer, with her, to some of the\r\nquestions he was still asking himself about Johnny Wendt.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rockland, N. Y.--Thursday, June 23, 1977, 2_ A.M. (_E.D.S.T._)\r\n\r\nShe watched him straighten up and come back to the bed. There were two\r\nwomen in her. One woman was glad because it would be all right now: he\r\nwouldn’t drink any more tonight. The other woman, watching as he came\r\nto her, was just glad....\r\n\r\nHe sat on the bed and pulled her against him with both hands. “Oh,\r\nbaby,” he said, and lowered his head to her breast. His hands moved up\r\nher back to her shoulders, pulled down the straps of her gown. “Oh,\r\nLisa, Lisa,” he murmured against her skin. His lips moved down and\r\nencountered the crumpled gown again. “What’s _that_ doing there?”\r\n\r\nHis head came up again, with the good smile, and he was still smiling\r\nas his lips met hers, while his hands pulled the gown down and off her\r\nhips.\r\n\r\nWhen he was asleep again, she knew it really was going to be all right\r\nthis time. He lay on his side, a faint smile on his face still, his\r\nbreathing even, untroubled, one hand cupping her breast. He looked _so\r\nyoung_....\r\n\r\nNow, the lines smoothed from his face, he could almost have been the\r\nsame man she had first met five years, and a world, ago.\r\n\r\nShe lay quiet under his hand. _Oh, Johnny! If you could just._...\r\n\r\nBut she stopped the thought. _No pushing_, she reminded herself. _No\r\npulling. He’ll come through his own way._\r\n\r\nBut this time she didn’t believe it. It was taking too long. And the\r\ntruth _was_, it didn’t get better. It only got worse.\r\n\r\n_Would it help if I left?_\r\n\r\nThat was the hardest part, to know if she herself did more good or more\r\nharm....\r\n\r\nShe tried to lie still and the effort defeated itself. One by one,\r\nthe muscles in her leg, her arm, her back and neck, stiffened to\r\nunsustainable tensions. She moved warily and he mumbled, his fingers\r\ntightening. Then he came up a little out of sleep, muttered “Sorry,”\r\nand rolled over, freeing her to move.\r\n\r\nBut now she was afraid that if she moved at all, the tears would spill\r\nout, so she lay still again. Not till his breathing was quiet once\r\nmore did she start edging over, an inch at a time, to her side of the\r\nbed. Then, holding herself balanced, as one might handle a bowl of hot\r\nsoup, she shifted her weight till her feet touched the floor and her\r\nbody was erect. She crossed the room, one silent padding footstep at a\r\ntime, nudged the door noiselessly closed behind her, went through the\r\nshadowed living room to the kitchen, and closed another door.\r\n\r\n_Coffee_, she thought. She put the percolator on, remembering he’d\r\noffered her coffee to start with. But she’d thought that if she drank\r\nwith him, he wouldn’t drink more than she did. Not much more, anyhow....\r\n\r\n_Well, it worked_, she thought, and added: _this time_.\r\n\r\nThe pot bubbled on the stove; Lisa sat on a stool and cried. No one\r\nheard either sound.\r\n\r\nAfter a while she got up and rinsed her face at the sink. She poured\r\nher coffee, took it into the living room, and sat restlessly. Got up\r\nand went to the bedroom, tiptoed in and got the book from her table.\r\n\r\nIt was a good thing he hadn’t looked to see what she was reading. She\r\nhad grabbed the first thing at hand when she woke up. She laughed\r\nsoftly, remembering his righteous engineer’s horror the first time the\r\nsubject of ESP came up. Now he could joke about it, mostly.... _You\r\nbetter watch out--my girl can read minds. She studies up on it_....\r\n\r\nBut in the ugly aftermath of the dream, if he had noticed, he would\r\nhave seized on it furiously.\r\n\r\nWell, it had all worked out.\r\n\r\nThis time.\r\n\r\nShe opened the book and read, sipping at coffee, till she felt ready to\r\nsleep again. Then she went back to bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART TWO\r\n\r\n_Thursday, June 23, 1977_\r\n\r\n\r\n_New York City--1_ P.M. (_E.D.S.T._)\r\n\r\nHe was only ten minutes late. _Pretty good--for me_, he thought\r\nruefully. The image of Doc Bronski came alive again behind his eyes,\r\nthe pink-cheeked old man listening and nodding while a much younger\r\nPhil Kutler talked importantly about his future plans. _Good!_ the old\r\ndoctor said. _Good!_ Then at the end, straight-faced: _Good! For you\r\nit’s right. Only once a day you got to get someplace. The rest of the\r\ntime, your patients worry about being on time._...\r\n\r\nUsually, he made sure to keep it that way; he did not ordinarily go out\r\nfor lunch. But on Thursdays, one to three was free and--for some reason\r\nhe had not yet examined--he had been very reluctant to have Lisa come\r\nto the office.\r\n\r\nHalf-way down the block, he saw her in front of the restaurant. She\r\nwas wearing green, a startling sea-green with a soft full skirt that\r\nseemed to float around her legs. She stood alone, very straight, with\r\nthe dancer’s solidity under her slenderness that always took him by\r\nsurprise. He noticed, too, that in her flat green sandals she somehow\r\nhad the posture of a woman in high heels; and that she stood without\r\nany impatience; and that something about her kept the other people who\r\nhurried heedless along the sidewalk, from bumping or brushing her.\r\n\r\n_She’s a good waiter_, he thought.\r\n\r\nWhatever had held her attention across the street released it. She\r\nturned and saw him, took a step forward as he hurried up.\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry,” he started. “You know how--” He saw her smile start. “You\r\ndidn’t have to wait out here. I had a table reserved.”\r\n\r\n“I was enjoying it.” She glanced across the street. “They’re gone now.\r\nThere were two girls waiting for someone over there--just kids, they\r\nlooked like--and three boys came down from the loft building next door\r\nhere and kept watching them. Then one of them went across, and the\r\ngirls wouldn’t talk at first, and I guess they were mad at their dates\r\nor whoever they’d been waiting for. Anyhow, they got together, and--”\r\nShe laughed, and took his arm. “--I’ll tell you this, you almost lost\r\n_me_. The third boy looked so _lonesome_--”\r\n\r\nThey sat down and ordered drinks. “I ordered lunch before,” he told\r\nher, “They make a good _cacciatore_ here, but you have to wait if you\r\ndon’t give them notice.”\r\n\r\n“Fine!” She talked on, still glowing, about the girls across the street\r\nand the ragged old man who had tipped his hat to her as he passed: the\r\nway the whole city _tingled_ on this kind of June day.\r\n\r\nShe had always loved New York. And she didn’t get down much these\r\ndays. Like a kid, on a holiday, he thought--or more like a kid playing\r\nhookey....\r\n\r\n“Does Johnny know you’re out?” It started light, but by the time the\r\nwords were on his lips, he had to work at keeping it that way.\r\n\r\nShe laughed. She had a good laugh, but this time it had lost the\r\nspontaneity of the sidewalk. “I’m not ... an escaped prisoner,” she\r\nsaid. “Johnny thinks it’s great I’m doing a little work for a change.”\r\n\r\nA few more minutes of holiday would have been nice, Phil thought\r\nirritably. Not _escaped_, no....\r\n\r\nShe went on, “He just flew me down, and I had a recording date at the\r\nCenter. That’s what made me think of calling you--I knew I’d be in the\r\nneighborhood.” The waiter set frosted martini glasses in front of them.\r\nLisa lifted her glass and held it toward Phil in a smiling toast. She\r\nsipped slowly. “All right, mastermind, you’re way ahead of me. No, he\r\ndoes _not_ know I’m out--” she set the glass back on the table with\r\ncare--“with _you_.”\r\n\r\nAbruptly, the cloak of detached relaxation that had enveloped her, held\r\nher apart from the sidewalk crowd, fell from her shoulders. It was,\r\nperversely, like watching another woman take off a too-tight dress,\r\nsighing out of girdle, stockings, brassière, into naked comfort. Lisa\r\nseemed almost to vent the same sigh of relief as she stripped the\r\npracticed, professional, surface of calm from the coiled tense energies\r\ninside her.\r\n\r\n“In fact, I almost called you to call it off,” she said. “After I\r\ncalled yesterday, I realized Johnny wouldn’t--Well, I guess I was sort\r\nof peeved. He was being silly about this morning. Oh Hell! I don’t have\r\nto explain it to you.” The edge of brightness in her voice was sharp.\r\n\r\nPhil leaned back in his chair, his hand twirling the stem of his glass\r\non the cocktail napkin, making wet circles. Across the table, Lisa sat\r\nstraight on her chair, her lips moving with taut animation, shoulders\r\ntensing a little with each new sentence. “You know, when we first\r\nstarted--seeing each other--he used to talk about you all the time:\r\n‘Phil said this,’ and ‘Phil told me that’ and ‘The way Phil explains\r\nit....’ It got to where I was actually jealous of you for a while\r\nthere....” She hesitated.\r\n\r\n“Fair enough,” he smiled. “I was kind of jealous myself....”\r\n\r\n“I bite,” she said. “Of whom?”\r\n\r\n“‘And to which, and with what?’”\r\n\r\nThis time her laugh was genuine. “Hey, Doc, remember me? I’m not a\r\npatient. I’m just your lunch date. The rule book says you have to\r\n_answer_ my questions.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I did. _Both_ of you, if you’ve got to know.”\r\n\r\nShe was embarrassed; he knew why, and let himself enjoy her confusion a\r\nmoment before he explained:\r\n\r\n“First of all, I kicked myself six times around the block for letting\r\n_anyone_ else walk away with you. And then I noticed this little cloud,\r\nsee? Absolutely no bigger than a man’s hand. You know what it was?\r\n_Professional_ jealousy. My psychiatrist explained it all to me. I was\r\nsore because you could get things out of Johnny that I couldn’t.” He\r\ngrinned. “And we _won’t_ go into anything about my choice of words,\r\neither--”\r\n\r\n_Or anything about why a girl who’s as miserably “in love” as you are,\r\nshould feel sorry for me for being single._... “Did you say a recording\r\ndate?” he went on aloud. “A new show?”\r\n\r\n“Well, not exactly a _show_.” She tasted her chicken and nodded\r\napprovingly. “They’re doing a tape series--Bartok--tri-di. We did the\r\nfirst movement of that percussion and celeste thing this morning.”\r\n\r\n“A series?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I haven’t _committed_ myself after this one. I didn’t know--This\r\nchicken is marvelous, Phil.”\r\n\r\n“Was this the recording or just rehearsal?”\r\n\r\n“Recording. I did most of my practice at home. Only had to come down a\r\ncouple of times.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” he said neutrally, “it’ll be good to see a new Trovi tape. You\r\nhaven’t done much recently.”\r\n\r\nShe looked at him with brittle amusement. “That’s like saying, ‘Johnny\r\ntook a long trip.’ You know damn well I haven’t done anything for the\r\nlast year, almost. Since we moved up there.” She stopped, waited,\r\nhoping he’d pick it up, give her an opening.\r\n\r\n_Not yet_, he thought with faint annoyance, and fed her a question\r\ninstead about the morning’s work. He ate slowly, watching from under\r\nhalf-lowered lids as she talked just a little too briskly about the\r\nsession: musicians; dancers; cameramen and their idiocies. The dark\r\nshadows under her eyes and strained set of her mouth did not match the\r\nbright narrative. She caught his eye, and her talk trailed off.\r\n\r\n“Okay,” he said, “So you got over being jealous of me. And Johnny does\r\nnot know you called me. And you’re back at work. Maybe. _And_ you\r\nhaven’t been sleeping. So?”\r\n\r\n“So--Well--Actually, it was sort of silly, I guess, calling you. I\r\nwas feeling kind of low, and I--well, Johnny was drinking a lot again\r\nand--in spite of what I said before, I guess he didn’t like my taking\r\nthis job too well. He may have to face up to _something_ he won’t like,\r\nsoon, though ...” she added, half to herself. “Actually, things are\r\nmuch better now. I almost called you up to call it off, and then I\r\nthought it would be good to see you again anyhow. I’ll probably tell\r\nJohnny when I get home.” But her face tensed again when she said it.\r\nThen she broke into a smile: “Only, I think I might better say I just\r\nbumped into you? If your conscience will let you back me up...?”\r\n\r\nHe nodded. Inside him a slot opened up, and like letters, the thoughts\r\nthat were not spoken slid safely into a waiting-room of his mind where\r\nhe could pick them up, open them and spell them out at his leisure.\r\n\r\n“Phil, the truth is, he--The way it is now, he _hates_ you! He hates so\r\nmany--Oh, I’m _sorry_, Phil! Does everyone treat you like this? Like a\r\npiece of furniture or something? As if you had no feelings?”\r\n\r\n_Not everyone, kid. Just my patients._ “If I’m lucky they do,” he said,\r\nlaughing. “That’s how you can tell your friends from a psychiatrist.\r\nSure, Johnny hates me, Lee. He’s got reasons. How would you feel about\r\na doctor who told you what was wrong with you, and then wouldn’t cure\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\n“_Wouldn’t?_ Oh. I guess he does feel that way.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not sure he’s wrong, Lee. I’ve been over that file fifty times in\r\nthe last year if I’ve looked at it once. And I _still_ don’t know why\r\nit fizzled. Which makes it pretty sure that the blind spot’s in _me_.”\r\n\r\n“But nobody else got anywhere at all with it!”\r\n\r\n“That’s just what I mean. He had some good solid frontline defenses.\r\nI got through. Period. Then I got lost somehow. I’m the guy who’s\r\npeddling road maps, see? And I didn’t have one for him. So he found\r\nhis own way out. Period and exclamation point.” He ate a forkful of\r\nhigh-priced sawdust, and added, “Also crazy-mixed-up metaphors. But you\r\ndig me, kid.”\r\n\r\n_Only you don’t_, he realized with an unanticipated pang of dismay.\r\n_You used to, but now you don’t. Lee, honey, can’t you think anything\r\nany more but Johnny Wendt? Or see, or hear, or feel._\r\n\r\n_Ah, cut the crap, Kutler!_ he told himself. Of course she couldn’t.\r\nWouldn’t. Shouldn’t. He knew that beforehand. He had it all planned for\r\nthem. _What the hell, Doc? You wrote the prescription yourself!_\r\n\r\n_So open up. Take the nice medicine._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mexcity--12_ M. (_C.S.T._)\r\n\r\nIt was not excessively hot, for late June in Mexcity. But four blocks,\r\nfrom the air-conditioned Government office to the cool stone walled\r\ninterior of the club left Chris sweat-sodden and near exhaustion. He\r\nwas a big man, with a powerful frame, who tended to run to flesh. He\r\nwas conscientious about exercise; he had to be, more than most of them.\r\nThey came up, mostly, for six months, a year--maybe six years. He had\r\ngone up with the first crew to work on the Dome; he had every intention\r\nof dying there--or farther out.\r\n\r\nBut meantime, he thought (as he thought every time he came down) he\r\nought to come Earthside more often; his muscles were in good condition,\r\nand the regular centrifuge workout topside kept the giant gravity\r\ndown here from overcoming him. But his heart pumped too hard; his\r\nblood rushed too much; and the unfiltered air out of doors clogged his\r\nnostrils; the sun bursting out from behind clouds seared his eyeballs;\r\nclouds hiding the sun obscured his vision. It was always too bright or\r\ntoo dim, too damp or too dry, too cold or too hot, when you were used\r\nto Dome-regulated atmosphere.\r\n\r\nToday, it was--for him--steaming hot.\r\n\r\nAnd, when he entered the cool lobby of the club, it was clammy cold.\r\n\r\nHe went up to his room, switched on the air conditioning and lay down.\r\nAfter a while his heart stopped thumping, and the sweat on his neck and\r\nback dried. He got up, peeled off the sticky clothes, called down for\r\nice cubes. A tall drink and a quick shower, and it was twelve-thirty.\r\nHe might still catch Harbridge for lunch.\r\n\r\nThe General was out, the Decagon switchboard said. He should be back by\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\nChris left his name. “Please have him call me as soon as he gets back,”\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\nIt was a relief, in a way. He ordered lunch sent up, and ate in comfort\r\nin the room, without having to venture out into the street again. As\r\nhe ate, he pulled out his notebook and pencil, and started figuring. A\r\nsmall smile settled on his mouth, while his second cup of coffee cooled\r\nin the pot. His pie sat forgotten on the back of the tray. Names and\r\nfigures and layouts and lists of equipment filled page after page,\r\nas Dr. Christensen practiced the day-to-day magic of modern science:\r\nfitting five pet projects into the money allotted for one. Twice, he\r\nstopped to make calls out: the first to New York, the second to St.\r\nThomas.\r\n\r\nHe was smiling grimly over a column of figures when they buzzed back,\r\nand he reached for it unthinkingly. He had already flicked the switch\r\nwhen he thought of his rumpled shirtsleeves, and the messy lunch tray\r\nstill in view. Too late....\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t Harbridge anyhow; it was Kutler, from New York.\r\n\r\n“Phil, for krissake! How’ve you been?”\r\n\r\n“Mostly good. I got a message here to call you back--what brings you\r\ndown to Earth? I thought you took vows up there--?”\r\n\r\n“Damn near.” He laughed. “Only thing I come down for is begging trips.\r\nSay, what’s the chances of getting together while I’m here? I’ve got a\r\ncouple of ideas I’d like to toss around with you.”\r\n\r\n“What’s on your mind?”\r\n\r\n“Couple of things. I’ll tell you, I’d just as lief not do it on the\r\nphone. Any chance of getting you down here?”\r\n\r\nThe other man hesitated, looked down at something on his desk. “Over\r\nthe weekend, I guess,” he said. “What’s your schedule?”\r\n\r\nChris shook his head. “I have to be at the base tomorrow afternoon.”\r\nBut there was nothing really to keep him in Mexcity till then. He\r\ndidn’t mind traveling: flying was more comfortable a lot of ways than\r\nsitting still, and he had enough vanity left to relish his VIP’s\r\nprivilege of a seat on the Mexcity-New York mail rocket--thirty-two\r\nminutes, pad to cradle. “Suppose I make it up your way?” he suggested.\r\n“Could we get together for a couple of hours? Tonight, maybe? Or\r\ntomorrow?”\r\n\r\n“Tonight would be better,” Kutler said. “I don’t see where I could\r\nsqueeze anything in at all during the day. Look--can you give me _any_\r\nidea what’s on your mind?”\r\n\r\n“Well, this much at least: I need a psycher to do a job for us. It’s\r\na big job. And I think you might be the right guy. There’s nothing\r\nsecret about it, really, but it just happens to be tied up sideways\r\nwith a Security problem, so--that’s all I can say on the phone.”\r\n\r\n“I see.” He was thoughtful. “Then it has nothing to do with--our mutual\r\nfriend?”\r\n\r\n“Friend? Oh--Johnny? No.”\r\n\r\n“Have you been in touch with him lately?”\r\n\r\n“No. What’s up?” He asked it casually enough, but in the time it\r\ntook to say the three words, a whole new set of possibilities and\r\nprobabilities opened up. The whole wild plan with Harbridge could be\r\nthrown out ... maybe even the lab transfer bit wouldn’t matter ...\r\nthough that was going to be necessary anyhow ... unless, of course,\r\nKutler--or somebody--could solve the leave problem....\r\n\r\nSlice it any way you liked, if Wendt was about to come out of his funk,\r\nthe whole picture changed--for the damsight better.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know exactly,” the doctor said. “I was sort of hoping when\r\nI got your message that you’d heard something. I just had lunch with\r\nLisa--”\r\n\r\n“Lisa?”\r\n\r\n“Trovi. The dancer. You know, she and Johnny are--engaged?”\r\n\r\n“Oh. Yeah. I knew about it. Didn’t know her name.” He dug back in\r\nmemory. “I thought they were married by now?”\r\n\r\n“Sort of.” Kutler smiled.\r\n\r\n“Oh. Well, you’re in touch then?”\r\n\r\n“Not really. I had lunch with Lisa, but that’s the first I’ve seen\r\neither of them in six months. You know Johnny quit on the therapy? He\r\nwouldn’t consider analysis, and we’d about had it with anything else.”\r\n\r\n“Oh. Well how does it look now?”\r\n\r\n“Offhand, bad. But I don’t know. I know Lee pretty well. She used to\r\nwork with me, you know? Dance and music stuff with a clinic group I\r\nhad for a while? She--well, just say, she’s not the panic type; but\r\nshe was pretty shook today. I figured things were just getting worse.\r\nThen I got back and found your message, and thought maybe you’d heard\r\nfrom him, and that got me wondering if whatever’s up with them could be\r\njust--call it _crisis_. You follow?”\r\n\r\n“Yeah.” _All the way. In fact, I’m way out front._ “And better slow\r\ndown, too. It could be nothing. But it _could_ be--”\r\n\r\nHe did not let himself pursue it further.\r\n\r\n“... any chance of your seeing them while you’re down? I know you’re\r\nbusy as hell, Chris, but I can’t go myself; I’m the last one he’d\r\ntalk to right now. And I don’t know who else would even _know_ what\r\nthe difference was, if anything’s happened at all--one way or the\r\nother. Lee’s a good kid, but I can’t rely altogether on what she says.\r\n_You’re_ not in love with the guy.” He paused, and added: “This is pure\r\nhunch, Chris. I haven’t got fact one to go on, but I’ve got a feeling,\r\nthat’s all. I think maybe this is the time that you could get through\r\nto him.”\r\n\r\n“Through, how?” he asked cautiously. Prayers don’t get answered like\r\nthat, on the phone.\r\n\r\n“I wish I knew. I don’t. I couldn’t tell you where or what or how or\r\neven who. I just think that something’s about to bust there. Could be\r\njust _her_, and you’d be wasting your time. But--I think it’s a good\r\ntime for you to see Johnny. If you still want him back that is?”\r\n\r\n“Yeah. We could use him.” _Want him? Jeeeeesus!_ “Okay, I’ll tell you\r\nwhat. I’ll try calling him. See what happens.” He thought quickly.\r\n“Suppose I get hold of him and call you back? See how his time stacks\r\nup--if he’ll see me at all. Then you and I can work out some time to\r\nget together.”\r\n\r\n“Good. I’ll juggle my time if I have to, for this.”\r\n\r\n“Right.”\r\n\r\nAfter he switched off, he sat and thought for a while. Then he moved\r\nthe tray, combed his hair, got his jacket back on, and tried Jed again.\r\nHe got through this time.\r\n\r\n“Say, don’t you get any phone messages there?” he demanded.\r\n\r\n“Sure, but I never get to make any calls. There’s always one coming in.”\r\n\r\nThe general and the scientist grinned at each other.\r\n\r\n“I take it you made out?” Harbridge said.\r\n\r\n“_I_ didn’t. _You_ did,” Chris told him. “They were all ready to let me\r\nout the back door with a pat on the head and a promise of a box of old\r\nclothes for my little Mars-bugs as soon as they had some to spare. But\r\nlab facilities down here for Earth-normal environment studies? Sorry!\r\nSo ... I told them, very sincerely, that I thought perhaps General\r\nHarbridge could be persuaded to handle the Earthside part of the\r\nproject--and we sat down and talked.”\r\n\r\nJed looked very innocent. “You know,” he said, “sometimes I wonder what\r\nwe ever did to make them so--_touchy_ over there?”\r\n\r\n“It’s a long story,” Chris said, and then, soberly: “Look, I still got\r\ntroubles. It worked out about the way we figured--some personnel money,\r\nand maybe a bit for supplies. Okay, we can run some good studies on\r\nthe bugs down here, which we need to, but they won’t even consider\r\ntransferring the whole lab setup down till the September report.\r\n_After_ elections, that means. It was a stone wall, Jed. We’re already\r\nshut out.”\r\n\r\n“Not _quite_,” Harbridge said. “But--” He didn’t have to finish it;\r\nthey’d been all over the ground the night before. “Well?” he said\r\nfinally. “What do you think? You want to try it the hard way?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know, Jed,” Chris said slowly. “It looked good last night,\r\nbut--Let’s say, if it looks necessary, a month from now would be soon\r\nenough. Don’t you think?”\r\n\r\n“Better,” the General said. “Silly season.”\r\n\r\n“Yeah. Okay. Hell, I hope we don’t have to--I’ve got a new line to try,\r\nanyhow.”\r\n\r\n“Something good?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. Phil Kutler just called me. You know--the psycher? I was\r\ntelling you about him last night?”\r\n\r\nJed nodded.\r\n\r\n“He’s been following up on Johnny Wendt. Thought I ought to see him,\r\nabout now.” He saw Harbridge’s wary glint. “If there’s anything to it\r\n...” he said prayerfully.\r\n\r\n“Well, if you get Wendt, you won’t need--” He broke off again.\r\n\r\n“What I was thinking--I’m going to call Johnny now. If I get anywhere,\r\nI’ll let you know.” He smiled. “_Or_ if I don’t. Either way, I’ll talk\r\nto you tomorrow before I take off.”\r\n\r\n“Right. Good luck, Chris.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks.”\r\n\r\nHe made several rapid calls, checking on the routine of the trip. Then\r\nhe built himself one more tall drink and switched on the phone.\r\n\r\n“I want Rockland, New York,” he told the operator. “The residence of\r\nColonel John Wendt. I don’t know the number. It’s person to person for\r\nColonel Wendt....”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rockland--4_ P.M. (_E.D.S.T._)\r\n\r\nThe phone chime couldn’t compete with Beethoven. He didn’t even hear it\r\ntill it rang once in an interval. Then he tried _not_ to hear it. But\r\nwhen the music began again, he was listening for it, and at the next\r\nchime he got up and went inside, turned the volume down and switched\r\nthe phone onto audio only.\r\n\r\n“Yes?” _Lisa!_ She was never this late....\r\n\r\n“Colonel Wendt? Hold the line for Mexcity, please.”\r\n\r\nMexcity? Not Lisa, anyhow. _Colonel_ Wendt? Who the hell--? What did\r\nMexcity want with him anyhow, at this late date?\r\n\r\n“Colonel Wendt?” The voice was familiar.\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“Johnny--hi! This is Chris.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll be damned! I thought you were away up there.”\r\n\r\n“Was. Will be. Tomorrow. Don’t you ever answer your phone? I’ve been\r\ntrying to get you for the last half hour.”\r\n\r\n“What’s on your mind?”\r\n\r\nA moment’s silence, after which Christensen’s voice came through just\r\na bit too loud and too jovial: “At the moment: dinner. What are you\r\npeople doing tonight? I thought maybe I could talk you into coming down\r\nto New York for the evening. I’m planning to hop the mail rocket there\r\nright away.”\r\n\r\n“Anything in particular, Chris?” _You’re not calling me just for love,\r\nole bud!_\r\n\r\n“Several things.” The voice was more normal.\r\n\r\nOkay. Backslapping gambit rejected. “How about tomorrow?” Johnny said.\r\n“I’m not sure I could, but--?” He let it dangle.\r\n\r\n“I can’t tomorrow. Got to be in Denver by three.”\r\n\r\n“Hate to miss seeing you,” Johnny said evenly. “Next time around,\r\nmaybe?” _Yeah, next century._ Perversely, he reached out and switched\r\non the video. After all, it wasn’t Chris’ fault. He’d been pretty\r\ndecent, all round.\r\n\r\n“My God, you look comfortable!” Christensen said. “It’s miserable here!”\r\n\r\n_So go back up where you belong._... “Yeah,” he said. “Hate to go into\r\ntown myself.” The perverse impulse swept him again. “Listen, why don’t\r\nyou come up here instead? Why don’t you eat with us? You know Lee,\r\ndon’t you?” _No, you don’t._\r\n\r\n“Only from watching her. Matter of fact, I’d like to. If you really\r\nmean it?”\r\n\r\n“Right. You can pick up a heli in New York, fly right in here. Just\r\nnorth of Nyack. Our strip is number seventeen. You can’t miss it.”\r\n\r\n“Okay. If I have any trouble getting on the rocket, I’ll call you back.\r\nOtherwise--let’s see--I guess I should make it about seven?”\r\n\r\n“We won’t eat till eight, probably.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll see you.”\r\n\r\n“Right.”\r\n\r\nHe switched off, and snapped off the player angrily. Well, it was his\r\nhome and his dinner, after all. He didn’t have to listen to anything he\r\ndidn’t want to.\r\n\r\nAnd where in Hell was Lisa?\r\n\r\nAfter four, now.\r\n\r\nHe went outside and got the coffee cup from the grass. Took it in to\r\nthe kitchen and poured it down the sink. Scrubbed the cup by hand, and\r\nfilled it up again, with just coffee. Got out another tape, a new piano\r\nboogie revival, and started the player again--loud.\r\n\r\nHe went into the work room and sat down at the drafting board, with\r\nits half-finished sketch. Lisa would be in any minute now. He got up\r\nand opened the door from the kitchen. Make her feel good to find him\r\nworking....\r\n\r\nHe stared at the sketch, trying to feel like a man who was working.\r\nThen something hit him--the ghost of an idea. Or the memory of one?\r\nThere was a picture in back of his mind of what the sketch _should_ be.\r\n\r\nThe memory was of a time when the pictures were always there, waiting,\r\nready to go onto paper, into wire and contacts and complex machines.\r\n\r\nThis picture was not shiny-new, the way they used to be. This was\r\nremembered, a legacy from himself. But it was sharp and clear. It was\r\ngood design. It would work.\r\n\r\nHe ripped the old sheet off the drawing board, pinned on a fresh one,\r\nand started sketching.\r\n\r\nThe coffee got cold between sips. The boogie tape came to an end, and\r\nbegan playing over. After a while, the kitchen door closed, or almost\r\ndid. He looked up. Lee was home. Going to start supper, he thought,\r\ndidn’t want to disturb him.\r\n\r\n_Hah! That’s a good one!_ He looked at the drawing. What the hell had\r\nhe been trying to do? _What for?_\r\n\r\nBut he felt good.\r\n\r\nHe went out and watched her move, wifely, around the room. When she\r\ncame within reach, he grabbed her and pulled her down on his lap.\r\nLaughing, she told him about the morning session, about the pickup\r\nshe’d watched on Sixty-third Street, the weird redhead salesgirl at\r\nBest’s that afternoon.\r\n\r\nSomething nagged at his mind; then he remembered. It wouldn’t be one of\r\ntheir good nights at home after all.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I should have told you before, I guess. Pete Christensen called.\r\nYou know, Moon Lab guy? He’s coming for dinner--?”\r\n\r\n“_Dinner?_” she pushed away, and stood up. “What _time_?”\r\n\r\n“Seven-ish.” He looked at the clock. It was almost a quarter of. He\r\ngrinned. “Well,” he said, “I forgot. I’m sorry, babe.” Then he pulled\r\nher back on his lap, and kissed her.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rockland_--9 P.M. (_E.D.S.T._)\r\n\r\n“I heard about this place,” the big blond man said slowly, “But I don’t\r\nthink I really believed it before.”\r\n\r\n_I like him_, she thought. And he _really_ liked the house. Lisa\r\npiled the last of the dinner dishes into the conveyer, and followed\r\nChristensen’s gaze out across the patio to the pink and purple glory of\r\nthe fading sun reflected in the river far below. She hadn’t seen any of\r\nit this way for a while. The house, the river, the sheer brown cliff on\r\nthe other side that was the twin of the one on which their house stood.\r\nThe food, the furniture, the porch on which they sat. All this, through\r\nthe stranger’s eyes, re-acquired meaning.\r\n\r\nChristensen was saying something, a question, about the conveyer.\r\nLisa opened her mouth, but Johnny was answering him. Well, that was\r\nsomething: at least he could still talk about his own bright ideas.\r\n\r\nThe flashing hostility of the thought shocked her. I’m over-anxious,\r\nshe told herself. She was being foolish about the whole thing. He\r\njust didn’t want company. He’d been working, and he didn’t want to be\r\ninterrupted, that’s all.\r\n\r\nJust the same, she was glad Chris was there. If they were alone, no\r\nmatter how much his mind was on what he was doing, sooner or later\r\nJohnny would have looked at her sharply, questioning. _Where’d you go,\r\nbabe? What took you so long?_\r\n\r\nSooner or later, she thought again. He still would ask: tonight or\r\ntomorrow, or next year. Sooner or later....\r\n\r\n_I won’t think about it. I won’t worry._\r\n\r\nIt had been easy enough not to mention Phil before. She had just talked\r\nall around it. The sense of shock returned as she realized that was\r\nwhy she’d gone shopping, why she had stayed so late. Luncheon was\r\nincidental to him by this time; it was the afternoon that bothered him.\r\n\r\n_I won’t think about it!_ She sat back in the chair, half-listening\r\nto Johnny’s explanation, and concentrated on visualizing what was\r\nhappening behind the conveyer door. Soundless, sterile processing of\r\ndirty dishes: along the perforated belt where floods of hot water\r\nrinsed the food particles down the drain into the grinder; then into\r\nthe washer, where detergent foamed around them; then out again along\r\nthe belt, through the rinsing spouts and the drying jets, and at last\r\nthrough the side opening of the long shelf in the kitchen, still neatly\r\nracked, ready to use.\r\n\r\nLucky Lisa. _Lucky, lucky Lisa._ Nothing to do. The dinner cooks\r\nitself, cleans up after itself. _Next week we put in the automatic\r\ndigester. Then there’ll be nothing left for Lisa to have to do except\r\nsit and stew about Johnny. And Lisa._\r\n\r\nShe stood up. “The view is really better from the living room this\r\ntime of day,” she said. _The girl speaks her lines well_, she\r\nthought idiotically, and watched the characters move to the new set,\r\nrearranging themselves with just the sort of almost-right staging that\r\nwas inevitable without a really _good_ director.\r\n\r\nThe Successful Scientist said something to the Ex-Rocket Jockey.\r\nEx-Rocket Jockey replied, rather shortly.\r\n\r\nBoth look at Girl. S S smiles successfully. E-R J smiles X-ly.\r\n(_Crookedly? I suppose_)\r\n\r\nGirl: (Smiling girl-ly) “Mmmmmm? I was daydreaming.”\r\n\r\nS S: “Just looking at your book here. I used to be fascinated with this\r\nstuff myself, but I haven’t done any serious reading outside the job\r\nsince--I don’t know when.”\r\n\r\nE-R J: (Points to Book) “_Serious?_ You too, Chris? Well, I’ll be\r\ndamned!”\r\n\r\nS S: (Embarrassed, but genial) “Oh, I don’t know. If you’d brought back\r\na couple of telepaths, now, instead of just bugs, we might have got\r\nsomewhere.”\r\n\r\n_Oh, God!_ she thought. _Oh my dear God!_ That did it. _Okay, here goes\r\nnothing!_\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“It is fascinating,” Lisa said slowly. “They’ve done a lot of work on\r\nit the last three or four years, you know.”\r\n\r\nChris shook his head. “I didn’t know. Anything really new?”\r\n\r\n“This fellow--what’s his name?--Potter,” she went on, as Chris held the\r\nbook jacket up to the light. “He has a theory that all the different\r\nkinds of psi powers that have been proved to exist so far--”\r\n\r\nShe offered the bait consciously, deliberately.\r\n\r\n“--all boil down to some form of PK....”\r\n\r\n“_Proved_ to exist?” Johnny asked coldly, taking the bait.\r\n\r\n“All right, _demonstrated_?”\r\n\r\n“Not to _me_.” He took the hook too.\r\n\r\n“Well, they’ve run enough experiments to show at least--all right, to\r\n_indicate_--”\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t hard to do. Easier than if he’d had a chance to sit there\r\nreacting to the mention of the trip. Why in _hell_ hadn’t she\r\nremembered beforehand that Dr. Christensen was the one who’d been in\r\ncharge of the whole trip? “Moon Lab” just meant some vague kind of\r\nresearch to her. But of course--\r\n\r\nIf she _had_ connected, what good would it have done? It was too late\r\nto stop him from coming.\r\n\r\n“--to _indicate_ that there are people who are--well, _sensitive_--”\r\n\r\nWhat was the book doing out there anyhow? She’d left it in the bedroom.\r\n\r\n“--and others who can control--All right, who _seem_ to be able to\r\ncontrol--”\r\n\r\nShe saw his smile loosen up a little bit, and found she could breathe\r\nagain without thinking about it.\r\n\r\n“--to control the motion of inanimate objects--”\r\n\r\n_Damn!_ She’d done it herself. She’d left it--No she hadn’t. She’d left\r\nit in the _kitchen_. Johnny must have picked it up during the day....\r\nThen he’d been reading it himself?\r\n\r\n“--‘non-physical’ isn’t the right word,” she said, still floundering\r\nhalf-deliberately. “That would put the whole thing right back on a\r\nmystical plane.”\r\n\r\n“Which is a fine place for it.” Johnny stood up. “Your glass is empty,\r\nChris. Lee? You ready?” She shook her head. He went out to the kitchen\r\nwith the two empty glasses.\r\n\r\n“You worked yourself into a hole,” Chris said, laughing, not knowing\r\nwhat had happened, or what had almost happened--maybe--either.\r\n\r\n“Back up about ten sentences, will you?” he asked. “You started to say\r\nsomething about Potter’s theory?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I haven’t finished the book,” she said. “Actually, I just got\r\nstarted on it last night. I wouldn’t want to try to explain it.” Her\r\nsmile looked less nervous than it felt, she hoped. “Do you get down\r\noften?” she asked, stalling until she could come up with something\r\nbetter. If they could get onto something _safe_ before he came back....\r\n\r\n“Not often enough, I’m beginning to think.” She liked the way he\r\nsmiled: he _meant_ it. And he meant what he said. All the time. “You\r\nsaid something before about ‘PK,’ and I’ve been trying to remember--”\r\n\r\n_Oh, no-o-o-o!_\r\n\r\n“--I told you, it’s been years since I followed the literature on this.\r\nPK is teleportation, isn’t it? Stuff like that?”\r\n\r\n_All right_, she thought recklessly, _the_ hell _with it_! Let Johnny\r\nhave all the fits he wanted to. This man was really interested: he\r\n_meant_ it. _And_ she liked him. And liked talking to him.\r\n\r\n“Psychokinesis is what it actually stands for,” she said. “That’s\r\ncontrol of physical objects--Well, actually, any psi activity that\r\ninvolves application of energy, rather than just perception.” Damn\r\nif she was going to keep floundering, either. She wasn’t setting up\r\nstraw houses now. “And Potter’s approach basically is that perception\r\ninvolves an energy transfer, too. Light rays have to strike the eye, or\r\nsound waves hit your ear, before you see or hear. Even internally, the\r\nmessage goes to the brain through a series of impulses that he claims\r\nwork like a radio condenser. I mean, he says the nerves don’t actually\r\ntouch, but energy stores up in one end until it sort of sparks to the\r\nend of the next one. So--wait a minute, let me find it here.”\r\n\r\nShe reached for the book. He had been studying the back jacket. “This\r\nman, Potter, is a neurologist,” he said thoughtfully. “Got interested\r\nin this stuff from working on neural exchange process. You know, that’s\r\ngoddam interesting. Say, Johnny, this is right up your alley, you\r\nknow? Thanks.” He took the full glass. “I never thought of it that way\r\nbefore, but if anyone ever _does_ crack this nut, I’ll bet it’s a cybe\r\nman who does it!”\r\n\r\n“Wouldn’t surprise me,” Johnny said drily. “Some of the squirrel tracks\r\nthey’re following now are no nuttier.”\r\n\r\nThe silence did not really last long. Christensen said mildly,\r\n“Which set of tracks did you have in mind, John? Cybernetics or\r\nparapsychology?”\r\n\r\n“Take your pick. I was thinking of some of the commercialized, excuse\r\nthe expression, _robots_. But if you want to drag para- or any other\r\nkind of psychology into it, that’s okay with me.”\r\n\r\n_The X-smile again_, Lisa noted. _I ought to do something._ This could\r\nget out of hand with no trouble at all. Everything she could think of\r\nseemed too absurd. It was quite evident that neither of them wanted\r\ncoffee. Or music, or cards, or a look at the Moon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_What the hell am I doing here?_ He knew the answer to that one, too\r\nwell: there were dozens--or hundreds?--of men who could handle the job\r\nhe wanted Wendt for. Handle it better than John could, from the looks\r\nof things. But none of them were named _Johnny Wendt: Space Hero_.\r\n\r\nAnd he, Peter Christensen, didn’t owe anything to them, either.\r\n\r\n_Oh, crap. You don’t need a new conscience, chum. You just need\r\nheadlines. Go fetch!_\r\n\r\nThen he saw that the glass in the other man’s hand was empty again.\r\n\r\n_Already?_ Things were worse than he’d thought....\r\n\r\n“Hey, Johnny, wait up!” He drained the glass, and decided he’d been\r\nmoralizing too damn much. If he didn’t have to fly back tonight, he\r\nwouldn’t mind tying one on himself. He followed his host to the kitchen.\r\n\r\n“What are you working on, now?” He asked, then chuckled. “Or have you\r\ngot an idea-conveyor-and-processor to do your designing jobs too?”\r\n\r\nThe answering grin was almost like a guy he used to know named Johnny\r\nWendt. “Not yet. Matter of fact, I got into something today that’s\r\nbeen half on my mind all evening. I keep forgetting to be sociable. We\r\ndon’t have much company here, you know....” He trailed off, and eyed\r\nhis drink. Then abruptly: “Got nine-tenths of something on the drawing\r\nboard,” he said, “if you want a look?”\r\n\r\n“Sure. I’d like to.”\r\n\r\nHe turned to follow and saw Lisa, halfway through the door, stop\r\nherself fluidly in midstride, and melt back into the living room.\r\n\r\n_Smart girl_, he thought. He stepped into the study.\r\n\r\nIt was a good room, well-designed, like the rest of the house, arranged\r\nfor comfort and use as well as looks. And it was Johnny’s room,\r\nbeyond a doubt. If he’d been brought here blindfolded, Chris thought,\r\nhe’d have known this room belonged to John Wendt. But there was also\r\nsomething that _didn’t_ fit: something you couldn’t quite put your\r\nfinger on. It bothered him.\r\n\r\nHe started for the drawing board, but Johnny waved him to the couch\r\ninstead. “Nothing worth looking at,” he said. “Not yet, anyhow.”\r\n\r\nChris sat down obediently. Anything he said was going to be the wrong\r\nthing. Let Wendt keep the ball.\r\n\r\nAfter a while, Johnny said, “Okay, let’s get it over with. _What_\r\ndidn’t you want to talk about on the phone?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know if you’d be interested,” Chris said slowly. “I just\r\nfinagled some dough for an increase in personnel. There’s a job I\r\nthought you might do for us, but....” He waved a hand to include not\r\njust the room, but the house and the river, and the life it stood for.\r\n“Why should you?” he finished.\r\n\r\n“Yeah. Why should I?”\r\n\r\nMore silence. Chris looked around still trying to pin down the elusive\r\nwrongness of that room.\r\n\r\nThen he got it.\r\n\r\nThere was a gilded football on a shelf from Johnny’s college days.\r\nThere were old books, and a couple of photographs on the wall that\r\ncouldn’t have any meaning except in one person’s memories. There were\r\nnew things, too. But there was nothing, nothing at all, in this room,\r\nor anywhere in the house, to remind Johnny Wendt or anyone else that\r\nthe man who lived here had spent most of five years of his life off of\r\nEarth: on the Moon, on Mars, inside the _Colombo_.\r\n\r\nInvoluntarily, Chris shivered, as a child shivers in the ghost-filled\r\ndark. He stood up, feeling tired. He had to get up early tomorrow\r\nmorning. He ought to be leaving.\r\n\r\n“Okay, so you changed your mind,” Johnny said. “What were you...? A-ah,\r\nnever mind. Skip it.” He picked up his glass. It was empty again. He\r\nstared at it, then put it carefully down, still empty. “I’m sorry,\r\nChris,” he said suddenly. “I’m being damn rude. I get--jumpy. Sit down\r\nfor krissake, and tell me what’s on your mind. You came all the way up\r\nhere to see me. I can at least listen to what you want.”\r\n\r\n“Okay,” Chris said. “But do me a favor?”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“Get the jug.” He caught Wendt’s eye and held it. “Then we can _both_\r\nsettle down. All right?”\r\n\r\nIt was close. Johnny wavered, then grinned crookedly and went for the\r\nbottle. _All right._ There wouldn’t have been much sense even in trying\r\nto talk if Wendt was lushing so bad he couldn’t admit it. _All right_,\r\nChris thought: _Here goes nothin’...._\r\n\r\nHe talked steadily for half an hour. Wendt sat and listened, arms\r\nfolded across his chest, legs crossed, lips pressed in, his whole face\r\nnarrowed and closed. When he spoke at all, it was in monosyllables.\r\nMore likely, he would just grunt a reply to a question. But he listened.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Damn place has turned into a bio lab,” Chris said.\r\n\r\nJohnny shrugged, didn’t smile. The man was a guest in his home; he’d\r\nbeen childish enough already.\r\n\r\n“Those damn bugs you brought back....”\r\n\r\nJohnny lifted his glass to his mouth, barely sipped, put it down. _So I\r\nbrought ’em back. All right. We’ve made that point now. Let’s drop it,\r\nhey, boy?_ He folded his arms across his chest, sat listening.\r\n\r\n“Look, before I get into this any more--this is so new, some of it,\r\nI mean, it hasn’t even been classified yet. But they’ll probably\r\ntop-secret it out of habit. For that matter, it might be pretty big. If\r\nyou’d rather _not_ hear--?”\r\n\r\n“It’s okay with me,” Johnny said. “Who the hell would _I_ talk to?” And\r\ncursed himself for an idiot. There went the last chance to get out from\r\nunder the whole damn fool thing gracefully. _Well_, he thought, _maybe\r\nI like to suffer_ ... or maybe it was time to find out how bad it was\r\nto sit through this kind of crap. Some day it had to get to where it\r\njust didn’t make any difference. It wasn’t _his_ ball game now. He was\r\noff the team. He was too old for it. If the kids still wanted to play,\r\nwhy should it matter to him if they babbled about it?\r\n\r\n_About time_, he decided, approvingly, biting his fingers into his\r\nbiceps across his chest.\r\n\r\n“Okay. Well, you remember those freak results on the first chromosome\r\ncharts?”\r\n\r\nHe nodded. Doug had--_Hell with that bit_! Listen to the man....\r\n\r\n“Well it got even freakier when we got some good clear micropics and\r\ntried it again. Turns out all seven varieties had the _same damn\r\ncharts_--let alone the same crazy number of genes.”\r\n\r\n“Yeah?” This time he allowed himself a small smile. It was getting just\r\ntoo damn silly. He knew where the damn bugs came from, and what they\r\ndid, and they were no more related than--\r\n\r\n_The Hell with it! Nobody’s asking you anything. Just listen, that’s\r\nall you have to do--listen!_\r\n\r\nAfter that he managed to sip and hear, hear and sip, and not think at\r\nall, mostly.\r\n\r\n“... maybe different parts of a cycle, or even mutated species of the\r\nsame bug? And we had just about decided we were dead wrong, when this\r\ncrazy new thing comes up--\r\n\r\n“Understand, now, we had these things under twenty-four-hour-a-day\r\nobservation, cameras on the microscopes around the clock, and not a\r\ndamn one of ’em ever did anything except make more of the same. No\r\nmeiosis, no conjugation, nothing to account for the diploid chart or\r\nmake any use of it. No mutations--but, _none_, see? That’s about the\r\nonly thing that kept anybody interested.\r\n\r\n“We figured at first maybe the lab is too clean. So we x-rayed a few\r\nbatches, and _still_ no mutations. Then some bright lad pops up with\r\nfigures showing that the increase in cell _deaths_ under radiation\r\ncorresponded to what you’d expect statistically for total of deaths\r\nplus mutations in protozoa down here. So these damn things would rather\r\ndie than change--they’re just not _capable_ of adaptation. It says here.\r\n\r\n“We had a couple of bio men around who thought this was the most\r\nfascinating thing since the original rib job, and I was kind of tickled\r\nat the idea of getting whatever those cells were using to resist\r\nradiations with--or I was until those statistics popped up to show it\r\nwasn’t resistance, it was just complete lack of flexibility.\r\n\r\n“So one of the bio boys gets the bright notion of trying a culture\r\nin Earth-normal atmosphere. I think he was chasing some notion about\r\nmutations being a complex result of radiations and some elements in\r\nthe atmosphere. And the first reaction looked like high score for him,\r\nbecause the damn bugs went wild. Not one friggin one of them stayed the\r\nway it was. _Every single one_ changed at least slightly.\r\n\r\n“So they started all over again, and when we ran off the first\r\nrolls of film, we found out we were not only getting meiosis and\r\nconjugation, but getting it between what were supposed to be different\r\nspecies--which was what we’d figured all along. The only thing we\r\n_weren’t_ getting was mutation!\r\n\r\n“Johnny, every damn one of those changes could be charted on the maps!\r\nAnd every damn one of ’em came out the way they were supposed to.\r\nSome of ’em were wild but not wild, crazy--just wild, way-out. You’d\r\nget a bacterium conjugating with an alga--or what we had figured for\r\nbacteria and algae, and the one of the products mixing with one of the\r\nwater-retentive fungi, maybe, while the other one went into symbiosis\r\nwith an unchanged alga and wound up like a new lichen--oh, some of\r\nthose things mixed and matched seven or eight times around before they\r\nwere done. But it all settled down into a group of five different types\r\nperfectly adapted to the environment they were in, and just as viable\r\nin it as they’d been on Mars.”\r\n\r\nIt seemed to be time to say something again. Chris looked like it was\r\ntime for an answer. It was damn sure time to wrap the whole thing up.\r\n\r\n“So?” he said. “What’s the scoop?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve just told you essentially all we know so far. What I came down\r\nfor this trip was to dig up some extra dough for a big program on\r\nit. Frankly, I’d hoped I could get all or most of it transferred to\r\nEarthside Labs. I think I’ll be able to get that come fall. Right now,\r\nit’s all upstairs, and if you feel the same way you did, I guess\r\nthere’s no point in asking--but let’s put it this way: I have a hunch\r\nour best approach to this will be with the math and, if we can do it,\r\nwith analogs. I don’t think straight bio experimentation will ever\r\ncrack this--unless we can set up the labs on Mars.”\r\n\r\n_All right, man, all right, get to it, will you? The answer is_ No!\r\n\r\n“So the first thing I need is a hell of a good cybe man, and you--”\r\n\r\n“Lots of good cybe men around,” Johnny broke in evenly.\r\n\r\n“Yeah. You realize, that part could just as easily be done down here?\r\nChrist, no reason you couldn’t work at home--don’t blame you not\r\nwanting to swap a setup like this for--”\r\n\r\n“Ready for a refill?” Johnny asked. “Wish I could help you out, Chris,\r\nbut I tell you, I’ve got my hands full right now. I--”\r\n\r\nChris was eyeing the bottle and glass in his hands. _Why so eager, son?\r\nI thought_ I _was the lush_...? Then he got it. His hand tightened on\r\nthe bottle neck as he poured.... _I’ve got my hands full_, he’d said.\r\n\r\n“Yeah,” he said out loud. He handed the glass back, and poured himself\r\none. “Yeah. Well--luck.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“... _really_ a pleasure. It’s a lovely place....”\r\n\r\n_Too smooth, too polite._ Whatever he come for, he didn’t find, Lisa\r\nthought. She was sorry.\r\n\r\n“Too lovely, maybe,” she said suddenly. “I think sometimes we forget\r\nwe’re still part of the human race.”\r\n\r\nShock raced around the room, bouncing off each of them to boomerang on\r\nthe others.\r\n\r\nJohnny’s grin was a social grimace. “Her trouble is just not having\r\nthings tough enough,” he said. “When we were still putting the place\r\ntogether, she didn’t have a gripe in her. Now I think she’d be jealous\r\nof the dishwasher.”\r\n\r\n_Laugh_, she told herself. _Go ahead. The man made a funny._ Chris was\r\nlaughing: a polite laugh, too. Surely she ought to do as much.\r\n\r\n“Frankly, I think it would get _me_ that way,” Chris said. “You know,\r\nthis is the only place I’ve ever been on Earth that has all the\r\ncomforts of home. And right now, I’d give anything to have, say, a\r\nweek, with nothing to do in a joint like this--Just lie around in the\r\nsun and listen to music and boss the servos around. But I’d bet I’d\r\nbe half-nuts in three days--” He stopped short. “I’m sorry. I didn’t\r\nmean....”\r\n\r\n“Well, why don’t you stick around...?”\r\n\r\n“We keep talking about taking a camping....”\r\n\r\nThey broke in at once, both broke off at once, and for some reason the\r\ntension was gone.\r\n\r\n“Well, any time you think you can stand a day or two of it,” Johnny\r\nsaid, “just give us a couple days’ notice....”\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t what you’d call wild enthusiasm; but for Johnny, it was an\r\neffusion.\r\n\r\n“Thanks,” Chris said, and meant it. He _did_ understand. “I’ll take you\r\nup on that one of these days. Right now--Look, how about turning that\r\naround? It wouldn’t be as uncomfortable as camping out, I’m afraid,\r\nbut at least it’s _different_. Changed a lot since your time, too,\r\nJohnny--You ever been up, Lee?”\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. She could feel the pinkness of her cheeks, and her\r\nown quickened breathing. She tried to see Johnny’s face, but he moved\r\nback a step into the shadow. She couldn’t even tell if her own feeling\r\nwas more excitement or apprehension.\r\n\r\n“We’ll think it over,” Johnny said. “Might be an idea.” His tone was\r\ncompletely flat.\r\n\r\n“You understand,” Chris said, “This has nothing to do with what we\r\ndiscussed? I’m talking about just a visit.”\r\n\r\n“Carfare’s pretty high, isn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“It’s on the company. The boss has some privileges.”\r\n\r\n“Well, we’ll think it over.” And this time, she thought, he really\r\n_meant_ it. He _would_ think about it.\r\n\r\n_What did Chris say to him? What did it?_\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey stood outside together, and watched the heli lift. Johnny switched\r\noff the landing lights, and the Moon jumped out of the background and\r\nhung like a lantern right over the patio wall.\r\n\r\nLisa stared up with a new fascination. After a while she became aware\r\nof Johnny’s eyes watching her, with mixed amusement and tenderness.\r\n\r\nShe moved closer to him. And broke the spell. “Nice to see Chris,” he\r\nsaid abstractedly. “Maybe we ought to take him up on that some time--if\r\nyou want to, I mean. But I--well, Hell, I wish he’d picked some other\r\ntime to come. I was only half here tonight. Look, babe, you mind if I\r\nsit up some? Got a little work I’ve been thinking about--design stuff.\r\nI was working on while you were in town today.”\r\n\r\n_Mind?_ “Go ahead,” she said, and made a face at him. “At least I’ll be\r\nable to finish that book of mine without giving you bad dreams.”\r\n\r\n_Mind?_ She watched him till he disappeared through the kitchen door,\r\nreading the angularity of his shoulders, the swinging of his hands,\r\nthe forward thrust of his head, and delighting in what she read. _We\r\nshould see more people_, she thought. But Chris was special.\r\n\r\nShe got ready for bed slowly, and lay there a long time, with the book\r\nopen in front of her, but not really reading. _What a day!_ The dance\r\nsession--Kutler--Christensen--and maybe even a trip to the Moon! And on\r\ntop of it all, Johnny working again.\r\n\r\nAfter a while, a sentence caught her attention, and she began reading.\r\nIt was after two when she finished the book, and turned out the light.\r\nShe fell asleep almost instantly, and dreamed of cute little fat\r\nviruses, teaching her telepathy, so that she didn’t have to wait for\r\nher baby to talk before she could communicate with it.\r\n\r\nHer baby....\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dollars Dome--10:30_ P.M. _(C.S.T.)_\r\n\r\nHer name was Rita. She stood immobile behind the high counter, head\r\nbent in a posture of reverie--almost of prayer--to the microscope\r\neyepiece.\r\n\r\nHis name was Thad. He was holding two culture plates which he had just\r\ncarried up from the Mars lab. He intended to set the plates down on a\r\nrack at the end of the room. But when he saw her, he stopped.\r\n\r\nHer new lab coat was spotless white, and she had pinned a stiff white\r\nsquare of cloth around her head to cover her hair. The way she stood,\r\nonly the shoulders and collar of her coat showed; the folds of the\r\nheadcloth draped so that the coat and cloth framed her face with the\r\nsuggestion of a robed and cowled young nun.\r\n\r\nShe was not pretty. But the serenity of her fresh-skinned cheek,\r\nemphasized by the furrows of concentration on her brow, gave her so\r\nmuch the look of the eternal virgin that he could not, at first, do\r\nanything but stand and stare.\r\n\r\nHe had seen her before, of course: in the cafeteria, several times;\r\non the Mall; at a party the week before; in the projection room,\r\nyesterday. It was a month, at least, since she came up. They had been\r\nintroduced at the party, and again yesterday, watching some films. He\r\ncould not have seen her less than fifteen-twenty times, altogether. And\r\neach time he had noted, without interest, only that she was new, quiet,\r\nplain-looking; and of course goggle-eyed and stumble-footed, like all\r\nnewcomers.\r\n\r\nNow he wondered how he could possibly have thought her _plain_; or\r\nwhy, when they met, he had registered only her name, Rita Donovan, and\r\nher background--a _summa cum_ type from Johns Hopkins. He had not been\r\nconcerned enough to learn if she were married or single, or otherwise\r\nunattached.\r\n\r\nIt might have been half a minute that he stood watching her. Then he\r\nwalked on and set his culture plates down. Neither his stillness nor\r\nhis action penetrated the distant focus of her concentration. He walked\r\naround back of her counter, and noticed she had damn good legs, too.\r\n\r\n“Something good?” he asked.\r\n\r\nShe started, and looked up.\r\n\r\n“_Good?_” She laughed. “Every time I see these things--They’re just\r\n_fantastic_!”\r\n\r\n“Right out of this world,” he reminded her, smiling.\r\n\r\n“Oh, of course.” She flushed faintly and her laugh held a note of\r\nembarrassment. “I guess I’ll get used to it too. Some day. But--”\r\n\r\n“Not very damn likely you won’t, if you’re working up here,” he said.\r\n“Not at the rate _these_ babies are going. We get to where it all\r\nseems almost normal, downstairs--every once in a while, that is. Then\r\nsomebody comes up with something like Hendrickson’s idea on controlled\r\nevolution, and you know you haven’t even scratched the surface yet!”\r\n\r\n“Have you seen his films?” she asked eagerly.\r\n\r\n“Not the whole thing. I caught part of the run this morning. They’re\r\nshowing ’em again at sixteen hundred.” He glanced at the big wall\r\nchrono, pleasurably aware that until his eyes moved, the pink lingering\r\nin her cheeks had been, in part at least, a (pleased?) response to the\r\nway he was looking at her. (Yes, pleased, he was sure, when he looked\r\nback.) There was an hour to kill before the showing. “Got anything\r\ncooking you have to stick with?” he asked. “We’d have just about time\r\nfor some coffee before they start.”\r\n\r\nShe looked around carefully, checking. “I guess nothing special....”\r\nHer hesitation was _not_ about leaving the lab; he was sure of it.\r\n\r\n“I’ll help you check out the cameras,” he said, and headed for the far\r\nend, brushing her arm as he passed. The intensity of joint awareness\r\nstartled--almost stopped--him. He debated suggesting his room for the\r\ncoffee: but only an hour....\r\n\r\n“Why don’t we go up to my place for coffee?” _she_ said. The words\r\nbroke the bubble of tension surrounding the touch.\r\n\r\nHe grinned. “I’m with you,” he said fervently.\r\n\r\n“What’s Hendrickson getting at anyhow?” she asked. “I didn’t hear\r\nhim the other night, but the way it looked in the _Abstracts_, he’s\r\nhypothesizing what amounts to _intelligent_ choice when he says\r\n‘controlled.’ Did you hear his talk?”\r\n\r\n“I missed it too. There’s so damn _much_ all the time, you never know\r\nwhich one to go to. But I got hold of him last night, and he won’t put\r\nit that way of course, but it seemed to me that’s how it added up.”\r\n\r\nThey left the building and went outside into the bright glow of\r\n“afternoon sunlight,” diffused from the dometop lights during the lunar\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n“But that means you also have to accept the idea of--I mean, what does\r\nthe _deciding_?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I guess that’s why he won’t use the word, ‘intelligence.’ He\r\nkeeps saying his theory is purely pragmatic--a description of behavior,\r\nhe says, not an explanation. So you can’t pin him down.” The most\r\nfantastic thing of all, he thought contentedly, more startlingly even\r\nthan the stuff you worked on up here were the people you worked _with_.\r\nShe had taken off the white kerchief, and out in the “sunlight,” her\r\nhair shone a rich reddish brown and her face glowed with something\r\nquite other than the austere intensity in the lab.\r\n\r\nThey entered the dorm building, and she started up the stairs. “Wait\r\na minute!” he said. “Anyone showed you the _right_ way to go upstairs\r\nhere yet?”\r\n\r\nShe laughed. “You mean ‘giant steps’?”\r\n\r\n“Yup. Race?”\r\n\r\n“You’re on.” They both knelt to remove their shoes. “Three flights,”\r\nshe said, and they set off together, bounding up four, five, six steps\r\nat a time under the light gravity of the Moon.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rockland--2_ A.M. _(E.D.S.T.)_\r\n\r\nAcross the patio, a glow of light from the opaqued bedroom wall showed\r\nhim Lisa was still up. He thought about that, and decided against it.\r\nToo much of that. Too much liquor; too much Lisa. Too much mash, too\r\nmuch mush. Half the drink was still in the glass. He stepped outside,\r\nand slowly, carefully, quietly, let it trickle over the edge of the\r\ntilted glass, till it was all gone, back to the soil. _Asses to ashes\r\nand alcohol to earth._ He lit a cigarette, and looked up again at the\r\nlooming deceitful lure of the Moon. He wasn’t going there. He wasn’t\r\ngoing. _Anywhere._ He’d done all his going. And all his coming. Yeah.\r\nToo much.\r\n\r\nHe looked at the drawing board. The design that had seemed so good,\r\nso _right_ in the afternoon now looked dead and clumsy. Hell with it.\r\nHell with--Damn him! _Damn him!_ Coming in here with his talk and his\r\nproblems and his five-year-old daydreams, throwing everything out of\r\nwhack. Tilting the machine.... Great big blond baby who didn’t know it\r\nwas too big to be out there. Nice safe little Moon base.\r\n\r\nHell, the Moon was part of Earth, didn’t they know that? Took all the\r\nknow-how they had to make out even there....\r\n\r\n... And they wanted to go to Mars! All the big babies, like Chris, out\r\nof the yard for the first time.... Stand on the curb screaming blue\r\nmurder to get across the street.\r\n\r\nWell he’d been across the street. And back. Back for good. If they\r\nwouldn’t listen to him, that was their tough luck.\r\n\r\nWhat he needed was a drink.\r\n\r\nHe went back and filled his glass. The bedroom light was out. Good. For\r\nonce, there was nobody watching, waiting, listening, to see what he’d\r\ndo. Nobody...? He walked through the living room and pushed the door\r\nopen, suddenly, silently. She was asleep, sound asleep, sprawled on the\r\nbed like a kid. She was smiling a little bit. She was beautiful. He\r\nclosed the door just as softly, and padded back to his work room.\r\n\r\n_Work_ room! That was a laugh. He laughed. _Haw, haw!_ The sound came\r\nout, too loud and not funny.\r\n\r\nWhat does Johnny Wendt want with a work room? Used to work. Don’t got\r\nto work now.\r\n\r\n_What for?_\r\n\r\nMoney? Smile once for a whiskey ad. That’s money. Science? That was\r\na laugh, too, but he didn’t try it this time. Science is a big blond\r\nbastard, fixing it for everybody to go the way Doug went.\r\n\r\n_Which way? Which way did you go, Doug?_\r\n\r\n_Doug, for krissake, where are you?_\r\n\r\n_Come back, Doug._\r\n\r\n_Doug, migod!_ And you stand on the dry dust with your suit all around\r\nyou to keep you safe in the thin air, and miles away, whichever way you\r\nlook, is nothing, nothing at all.\r\n\r\nBetter have another drink. Put the bottle down, now. Careful. Might\r\nspill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART THREE\r\n\r\n_Friday, June 24, 1977_\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rockland--8:30_ A.M. _(E.D.S.T.)_\r\n\r\nHe woke with a twist in his neck and his shoulders and arms stiff and\r\nsore. Faint sounds somewhere took on shape and meaning. Lisa, in the\r\nkitchen. Breakfast. His stomach turned over, and settled down to hunger.\r\n\r\nHe’d decided to go to the Moon. _Why?_\r\n\r\n_Who knows?_ He shrugged. _What’s the difference?_\r\n\r\nHe’d decided something; that was an accomplishment right there. Yeah,\r\nbig deal: go see ole buddy Chris and get yapped at some more. Okay,\r\nhe’d _decided_, hadn’t he? Give Lee a kick anyhow.\r\n\r\nLisa Goes To The Moon. He started to laugh, but he coughed and\r\nhalf-choked instead. He was thinking of the magazines when he was a\r\nkid. Too bad Lisa couldn’t wear one of those bubble-type outfits the\r\ngirls on the magazine covers had. That would go over big, in the Dome!\r\nHe could just see them, Chris’s crew of tame scientists, goggle-eyed.\r\n\r\nSpent two damn years up there and never saw a babe worth looking at.\r\n_All_ goggle-eyed.\r\n\r\nThis time the laugh almost came out right.\r\n\r\nIf it was a magazine story, though, Chris’s little Mars-bugs would\r\nturn out to be secret-super-intelligences with invincible powers, from\r\nBetelgeuse.\r\n\r\nOr Arcturus.\r\n\r\nThat would be nice, he thought. Let it turn out poor old Doug was just\r\na rabbit mesmerized by these snakey protozoan _intelligences_. Pretty\r\nsoon they’d take the whole world over, too--except for The Hero, who’d\r\ndash in and save everyone just in time.\r\n\r\nSinging: “I’ll be glad when you’re dead, you amoeba, you.”\r\n\r\nLee was making breakfast. He wasn’t ready to see her yet. He found the\r\ncoffee jar, and made himself some, boiling scalding hot, turned the\r\noutside wall to full light and transparency, and propped himself on the\r\ncouch with the hot coffee and the hot sun shining on him.\r\n\r\nWhen he was ready to go out to the kitchen, he found her just finishing\r\nher breakfast, wearing yellow shorts, _very_ short, and a bright\r\npurple halter top, looking about sixteen years old.\r\n\r\n“Hi, doll.” Grinning made his face feel cracked and a million years\r\nold. “How come you look like that when I feel like this? I worked\r\nlate,” he said. “Lay down to think something out, and I fell asleep.”\r\n\r\n“Sure,” she said.\r\n\r\nHe looked straight in her eyes for a moment, and remembered she wasn’t\r\nreally a kid. She was two months older than he was. He hated her for\r\nknowing what he wouldn’t tell; and blessed her for not trying to make\r\nhim say it. He sat down and patted her hand.\r\n\r\n“Hey, babe?”\r\n\r\n“Hmmmm?”\r\n\r\n“I seem to have made a decision.”\r\n\r\n“Yes?” But there was something scared in her _eyes_.\r\n\r\n“I have some recollection of deciding last night that we would go to\r\nthe Moon.”\r\n\r\nShe surprised him. Last night, he was sure she was all hopped up about\r\nit. And even now, the scared look left her eyes. _Scared? Why? What\r\nof?_ She looked pleased, all right. But she didn’t say a word.\r\n\r\n“That is, if you still _want_ to go,” he said stiffly.\r\n\r\n“I--well, yes, but--Let me think about it a little. All right?”\r\n\r\n“Sure.” He stood up and went and looked in the warmer. Bacon and toast.\r\n_You goddam lucky bastard_, he thought, _You’re so used to her doing\r\nthings your way, you think you have to get sore if she doesn’t climb\r\nall over you and yell Hallelujah!_\r\n\r\nHe made a sandwich out of the bacon and toast, and went back to the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n“Whatever you want, baby,” he said softly.\r\n\r\n\r\n_New York City--6:15_ P.M. _(E.D.S.T.)_\r\n\r\n“Well, I’m sorry,” Kutler said. “I guess it was a bum hunch.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. You weren’t too far off--I don’t think. But damn if I\r\nknew how to get through. You’re sure there’s no way _you_--?”\r\n\r\nThe doctor shook his head. “I wish I could. I’ve tried a couple of\r\ntimes. I’ll keep on trying. But--” He shrugged, and finished his drink.\r\n\r\nPete Christensen cleared his throat. “What do you say to some dinner?\r\nThis place serve any food?” _Damn it, the guy actually gives a damn!_\r\nYou didn’t find many like that any more.... _Any more_...? Damn fool\r\nthought. Never was more than one in a million who did--outside his own\r\nyard or his own pocketbook.\r\n\r\n“Well, they serve it,” Kutler said. “Nobody in his right mind would\r\neat it. Tell you what--there’s a place down the street here--You like\r\nSwedish cooking?”\r\n\r\n“Grew up on it.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor nodded, pleased. “Okay, let’s get out of here.” He caught\r\na waiter, paid the check, and they walked down Lexington toward the\r\nSwedish place, talking trivia about the city and how it changed. It\r\nmust have been seven-eight years, Chris thought, since he’d seen this\r\npart of town; yet some blocks, you could go back twenty years after,\r\nand nothing changed at all.\r\n\r\n“I used to love this damn town,” he said, surprised, because it had\r\nbeen so long since he had even thought about New York, let alone\r\n_looked_ at it. Kutler was good for him; the man _cared_. It was a\r\nlittle painful even to visualize all the things he seemed to care\r\nabout. Like a wheel hub, with another spoke reaching out every\r\npart-turn. “I guess,” he said slowly, “I’ve put it all into one.” And\r\nthen thought, _That was dumb._ Then: _But he knows what I meant._\r\n\r\n“Rockets only go one way at a time, don’t they?” the doctor said.\r\n\r\nChris cleared his throat.\r\n\r\n“Here we are,” Phil said.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they’d ordered, Chris plunged in. “Here’s what I wanted\r\nto see you about, Phil. You know, we’ve had a personnel problem up\r\nthere all along that’s a little unusual. I suppose you know the\r\nbackground--I’m sure you do, because we fed you this stuff when you\r\nworked with Wendt. Our psychogenic troubles?”\r\n\r\n“Yeah. Fascinating stuff, too. I figured if you wanted me, it would be\r\nsomething to do with that. But you want a good psychosomaticist, Chris,\r\nthere are a hell of a lot of ’em better than me. I’ve always been\r\ninterested, but it’s not really my field.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t need just a good psychosomatics man,” Chris said. “We’ve\r\ngot the problem under control from the point of view of our people’s\r\nhealth. Nothing to it. Every damn contract calls for one month Earth\r\nrest leave after each working quarter. Three months up, one down.\r\nKeeps ’em healthy as hell. Any good psychosomatics man will tell\r\nyou that’s the only answer, short of an all-out training program\r\nthat adds up to something like studying yoga, f’krissake!” He dipped\r\ninto heaven-scented pea soup, and broke crisp bread. “Phil, what I’m\r\nafter is someone who’ll look at it from the point of view of a new\r\nenvironment that men damn well _can_ live in. _I_ do. Have, more than\r\nten years now. Some of the others could, if the contracts let ’em. I\r\ndon’t know how you feel about this. Maybe you’ll take the same stand\r\nthe others do: we’re asking for something ‘unnatural,’ and we have to\r\npay the price. I just had a hunch you might--feel differently.”\r\n\r\n“Because of Johnny?” the doctor asked quietly.\r\n\r\n“All right.” Chris let himself look at the other man for the first time\r\nsince he’d started his speech. “Because of Johnny. But I mean it a\r\ncouple of ways.”\r\n\r\n“Relax, will you?” Phil looked as if he could take some of his own\r\nadvice, too. “Who’s kiddin’ whom? _I_ know I feel guilty about Johnny.\r\nSo what difference does it make if _you_ know it too? But that doesn’t\r\nmean I’m going to throw up a good practice here and go tromping off to\r\nOuter Space to offer myself up in his place.”\r\n\r\nChris finished the pea soup, looked at the other man, and laughed.\r\n“Damn it, I’ve got to get down more often,” he said, and laughed again.\r\n“I keep saying that. When I’m down. Now look: first of all, I said it\r\nwas a _couple_ of ways ‘because of Johnny.’ Sure, that was one of them.\r\nThe other is, you _did_ get _some_where with him. Or come to think\r\nof it, that’s just _one_ other part of it. You got through to him;\r\nnobody else could. That means, the way I see it, you maybe--speak our\r\nlanguage some? You don’t start with the idea that being off of Earth is\r\n‘unnatural.’ Am I wrong?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t think so,” Kutler said slowly. “Hadn’t really looked at it\r\nthat way. Maybe so--What’s the other bit?”\r\n\r\n“Obvious. Just that you’ve had some experience with our kind of nut.”\r\n\r\n“Oh _now_! Just because two guys have been to the same place, and both\r\ncome back sick doesn’t mean--” He stopped short. Chris grinned. “Yeah.\r\nI see what you mean,” the doctor went on, slowly. “Nine times out of\r\nten, it does mean just that. Only,” he finished, “Johnny didn’t get\r\nsick on the Moon.”\r\n\r\n“Well, frankly, I didn’t mean it that strongly anyhow. You’re way ahead\r\nof me, as usual. But--let’s just say, if I’ve got a sick horse, and I\r\ncan’t get a vet--because nobody’s invented veterinary medicine yet--I’m\r\ndamn well going to try to find a doctor who’s at least _worked_ on a\r\nhorse before.”\r\n\r\n“Even if it died?”\r\n\r\n“He’s not dead,” Chris said drily. “Far from it. You seen that layout\r\nup there?”\r\n\r\n“Not since it was finished.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you’ve seen the girl.”\r\n\r\n“Yeah.” Kutler looked at him levelly. “I saw her yesterday. He’s not\r\ndead. Yet.”\r\n\r\n“He’s sick. Okay. You _still_ know more about--horses--than a man who’s\r\nnever opened one up.” Kutler started to speak, but Chris went on. “At\r\nleast, _I_ think so. So here’s what I’d like to ask you to do--”\r\n\r\nHe opened his briefcase, and pulled out the folder of case histories\r\nand medic reports. “Here’s the background stuff. If you can find time\r\nto look it over, and you think you’re willing to consider the idea at\r\nall, what I’d like to do is start sending my leave people in to see\r\nyou. Not for treatment,” he said hastily, as the doctor tried to stop\r\nhim again, “Just interviews, sort of. Get your own histories on them.\r\nSee what ideas you get. This thing is wide open, Phil. I don’t know if\r\nwhat we need is a man on the job up there, or a consultant, or a whole\r\nstaff and program, or what the hell. I figure you can at least give us\r\na push the right way. Will you hire on as consultant for now on that\r\nbasis? Then if you think you’re not the right man, find us one. Or a\r\ndozen. Or tell us what we need. Or tell us you can’t even do that. But\r\ngive it a whirl, will you? I don’t know where else to start with.”\r\n\r\nKutler hesitated, still. “How much time do you figure I’ll need for\r\nthat ‘month’?”\r\n\r\n“You decide. Give it what you can. Take what time you need. Bill us\r\nat whatever your hourly rates for government jobs are. We’re used\r\nto cost-plus,” he added drily. “Don’t stint yourself on the expense\r\naccount. When you’ve got a yea or nay or maybe for me, let me hear it.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor was silent a moment, and Chris held his breath, almost.\r\nHe’d had the right hunch this time. If Kutler took it at all, he just\r\n_might_ actually crack it--because if he took it, he’d kill himself\r\n_trying_.\r\n\r\n“I can at least look over the literature,” Phil said finally. He\r\ngrinned. “Which in English means, all right, so you’ve got me curious.\r\nOr hooked?”\r\n\r\nChris passed over the envelope with the folder. He saw Phil’s eyebrows\r\ngo up.\r\n\r\n“What’s this bit?” He was indicating the red-stamped TOP SECRET.\r\n\r\n“Christ, I get to where I don’t even see it. Every damn thing we do\r\nup there--But on this job, they mean it. Only reason I got funds for\r\nanything as--way out?--as this was Security has fits about these people\r\ngoing up and down all the time. Anything to keep ’em up on the farm,\r\nthe way they see it. Frankly,” he added, “that was another reason for\r\nwanting you. You’re cleared already. God knows how long I’d wait before\r\nthey found another man they’d put their gold star on.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Acapulco--7:30_ P.M. _(C.S.T.)_\r\n\r\n“What do you think?”\r\n\r\nBrigadier General Jedro Arthur Harbridge, USA ASF, turned from the\r\nbar cabinet in the study of his country home with an air of some\r\nsatisfaction. He carried two palest-gold martinis to the desk, handed\r\none ceremoniously to his Press Secretary.\r\n\r\n“Hard to say,” Prentiss answered. “Thanks. Well--here’s luck!” He\r\nsipped appreciatively. “Okay, you win. The Dutch gin _is_ better.” He\r\npicked up the memo he’d been looking at while the General mixed drinks.\r\n“I can’t see anything in here that will make headlines--that’s sure.”\r\n\r\n“Okay.” Harbridge settled down in an anachronistically\r\nsolid-comfortable leather chair. “What _are_ you going to make ’em\r\nwith, then?”\r\n\r\nAl Prentiss shrugged one gray dacron shoulder. “What’s the rush?”\r\n\r\n_You wouldn’t understand, boy, if I spelled out every word!_ This\r\nparticular rush had started a _long_ time ago--for some people. For\r\nothers, including all or damn-near-all PR men, the General thought,\r\nthere _was_ no rush: just the crush of the crowd.\r\n\r\n“That’s my problem,” he said heavily. “Now _your_ problem is getting\r\nthe Dome in the papers, and getting it in good.”\r\n\r\nPrentiss studied his chief’s face, and nodded. “Okay. So let’s take it\r\nfrom One. How much of this stuff has been released before?”\r\n\r\nHarbridge frowned. “Just the general background. Nothing on the genetic\r\nstructure at any time. Seems to me, the only thing that went out was a\r\nfilm made up from their lab micros, with a very basic sound-track--you\r\nknow, the little Mars whachahoosies in their natural habitat?--the\r\nsymbiosis stuff, or fission or fusion, or whatever these dingusses do\r\ninstead of screw--that kind of thing. That’s about a year ago, I guess,\r\nlittle less. On the other hand, I think the only stuff mentioned here\r\nthat’s been officially classified is the chromosome chart stuff: or\r\nanything that was done before June 1, come to think of it, unless it’s\r\nbeen released. That was the last full regular report, and _they_ get\r\nstamped before they’re read.”\r\n\r\n“So I’m stupid,” said Prentiss, “but what’s such hot news about\r\nchromosomes? We all got ’em.” He stood up abruptly. “Damn it, sir,\r\nyou just can’t make good copy out of what a bunch of amoebas do for\r\nsex--even if they come from Mars.” He held the papers fanned out, and\r\nlooked at them with scorn.\r\n\r\nHarbridge took the sheets, and held them in his lap. A slow smile\r\nspread on his face. “All right, Al. I’ll give you a story to write. Two\r\nof ’em. First one is the bugs. Just what’s in here, but no details.\r\nLeave out the chromosomes: they might not be copy to you, lad, but\r\nthey’re hot, believe me. Now let’s see.”\r\n\r\nHe put his drink down, picked up the papers again, and reached for\r\na clipboard and pencil. Then he went through carefully checking and\r\ncrossing-out.\r\n\r\n“Use this, you can quote this bit direct,” he said, as Prentiss came\r\naround the desk to look over his shoulder. “‘... startling adaptation\r\nsyndrome, which does not conform so much to the concept of mutation as\r\nof controlled evolution.’ Hey, you know this stuff is pretty jazzy,\r\nAl. Come to think of it, we better leave out the last bit--What the\r\nhell does he mean, ‘controlled’ evolution? Who’s doin’ the damn\r\ncontrolling?--Never mind. Just make it, ‘does not conform entirely\r\nto the usual concept of mutation.’ Leave out all this part about the\r\nEarth-normal environment--that’s _really_ secret. Here, this bit won’t\r\nhurt anything, ‘... genetic relationships between species ...’ and if\r\nyou just change this about capacity for cross-breeding to something\r\nabout experiments at cross-breeding--make it sound like Luther Burbank\r\nor something--you follow all this?”\r\n\r\n“From a distance,” Al Prentiss said dourly. “Or maybe through a glass,\r\ndarkly.”\r\n\r\n“Okay. Now this chromosome chart bit I guess is pretty touchy too,\r\nbut there’s no reason we can’t say something like ‘unusual’ or\r\n‘unanticipated’ chromosome count. What do you think?”\r\n\r\n“I’d hate to say--_sir_. But if you mean, do I think I can write a\r\nstory out of this that sounds like telling something without actually\r\nanything classified--sure. Just let me run home for my trusty old\r\nbio notebook, so I know what I’m talking about, and I’ll whip right\r\nout--one, two, three.”\r\n\r\nThe General put down the memo, stood up, and laughed. “In your own\r\nunpleasant way, Al, you’re a good boy. Drink up, you’re too slow.” He\r\ntook the empty glasses back to the bar, and immersed himself once more\r\nin his elaborate martini ritual.\r\n\r\n“I take it,” Prentiss said thoughtfully, “that when I get this written,\r\nyou’d like to see it in print somewhere?”\r\n\r\n“Probably.”\r\n\r\n“I see. Following the same thought, I come up with the notion that\r\nyou’d want to see it--if you did--in some paper whose publisher does\r\nnot play golf with you?”\r\n\r\nHarbridge nodded solemnly. “Not even the editor,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Right. I assume then....”\r\n\r\nThe phone buzzer sounded. Harbridge lost all interest in the bar. He\r\npicked up the phone, leaving his inscreen dead. “Hello.”\r\n\r\n“Jed? Hi. Listen--”\r\n\r\n“I’ve got company,” Harbridge said. “I think he’d rather not know who\r\ncalled. What’s the word?”\r\n\r\n“No dice. I spent five hours and had a lovely time. Nice wife. Or\r\nwhatever she is. But no dice. Stone cold dead, I’d say. You better take\r\nthe ball.”\r\n\r\n“Okay. You know this can get rough?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve got callouses.”\r\n\r\n“You’re on, man.” He hung up, wondering just how sure young Prentiss\r\nwas as to Chris’ identity: and whether it mattered.\r\n\r\n“In short,” said Prentiss smoothly, “I assume that once the thing’s\r\nplanted, we never _heard_ of it. Do I dig you, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Right where I live,” said the General. “And, by the way--I _do_ want\r\nto see it in print, for _sure_.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART FOUR\r\n\r\n_June 28--August 4, 1977_\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rockland--Tuesday, June 28_\r\n\r\nFor four days, she’d been waiting for Johnny to leave the house: leave\r\nit long enough so she’d _know_ she had ten minutes’ time all alone.\r\n\r\nIt was hard to believe it could have gone that far; but when she\r\nthought back, it must have been going on quite a while now. Unless they\r\nwent somewhere together, days--or weeks?--might go by till Johnny found\r\nany reason to go even down the road.\r\n\r\nThey had built the house in the exact center of their own thirty-five\r\nacres: no near neighbors to plague them--or to gossip with or play\r\nbridge, or borrow lawn-mowers, or any one of the things that might take\r\na man ten minutes’ walk to the next house.\r\n\r\nThe place was provisioned and stocked for every possible need. They\r\nmarketed once a month--together.\r\n\r\nOn rare occasions, if the heli needed work Johnny did not want to do,\r\nhe’d fly down to Nyack; usually, she went along, anyhow, and they’d\r\nhave dinner out, take in a show, spend an evening pub-crawling,\r\nsomething like that.\r\n\r\nBut the house had everything that he wanted; most of all, it had _her_.\r\nUp till now, that knowledge by itself had been enough to allow her to\r\noverlook, not-notice, or never-mind all the rest.\r\n\r\nBut now, for four days, she had wanted to make one single phone call\r\nwithout him around: and there had never been a time she could be _sure_\r\nhe wouldn’t wake up, or pick up an extension from some other room,\r\nor--or _some_thing.\r\n\r\nThe whole thing was ridiculous. Most of all, her own feeling about it\r\nwas all out of proportion. She kept telling herself that.\r\n\r\n_Just pick up the damn phone and call!_ He was in the shower; how was\r\nhe going to hear her from there?\r\n\r\nBut, again, she jittered around until, just as she reached for the\r\nswitch, he came out.\r\n\r\n_Damn!_\r\n\r\n“Hi, babe.” He came over and kissed her. And at the touch, the easy\r\nrelaxation with which he had entered the room vanished. “What’s the\r\nmatter, babe?” He sat down and put his arms around her; tilted her face\r\nup with one hand under her chin.\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” she said unconvincingly, and tried to smile a response to\r\nhim. That was not very convincing either. She saw the small muscles\r\nin his jaw tighten up, and start knotting. _Oh, God damn!_ “Probably\r\njust--time of month, I guess,” she said.\r\n\r\nHe bought it. He grinned and patted her on the head sympathetically;\r\nhis face relaxed; he stood up with the confident nonchalance of\r\nmasculinity, not prey to nervous cyclic emotions, and went into the\r\nkitchen. A moment later, he called back: “I’m going out and see what I\r\ncan do about that door handle.” The door slammed.\r\n\r\nShe saw him cross the back lawn toward the hangar. She watched till he\r\nwent inside. With her eyes still on the window, she switched on the\r\nphone.\r\n\r\n“May I speak to the doctor?” she asked the pert nurse who answered.\r\n\r\nDr. Aaronson looked harassed as usual, but his smile was beatific:\r\n“Everything’s fine,” he said. “All down the line. Don’t give it a\r\nthought. You ought to come in, say, oh, two-three weeks?”\r\n\r\nShe tried to look as she thought she ought to feel. “That’s wonderful,”\r\nshe said. “Look, I’ve got a problem.”\r\n\r\n“Hmmm?” His eyes were watching something else off the screen. His\r\nmanner said clearly: _I already told you, you don’t have a problem._\r\n\r\n“It’s just--well, is there any reason--” It sounded so _silly_, when\r\nyou came to ask it. “--reason I shouldn’t take a trip to the Moon?”\r\n\r\n“How far--” he’d started to ask before she finished. His eyes swivelled\r\nback sharply. “Well!” It was the first time she’d ever heard him laugh\r\nout loud. “Well!” he said again, satisfied, “I thought I knew _all_ the\r\nquestions by now! Offhand, let’s see--I can’t see any reason not to, in\r\nthe shape you’re in. When did you plan to go?”\r\n\r\n“I’m not sure--two or three weeks? A month, maybe?”\r\n\r\nHe nodded thoughtfully. “Well, I’ll check up, but I don’t see why not.\r\nStop in for a checkup before you go.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks. I will. I’m sorry if I interrupted you--”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense. It was a pleasure, believe me. I think that’s the first\r\n_new_ question anyone’s asked me in fifteen years.”\r\n\r\nShe switched off and sat there a minute, her eyes at last off the\r\nwindow, her whole self composed for the first time in days.\r\n\r\nHe found her half-asleep in the sun at the edge of the pool, her orange\r\nswimsuit with the tigerish black stripes a splash of color on pale\r\ngreen tiles. She lifted her head and squinted at him from some faraway\r\nplace inside herself.\r\n\r\n“Hi, handsome,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Hello, babe.” He dropped into a chair, looking down at her. She was\r\nokay now. She started lifting herself up from the tiles, backbone\r\nfirst, as if someone had tied a rope around her torso, and was pulling\r\nher up. He watched, fascinated; incredible, what she could do with\r\nherself!\r\n\r\n“How’s the water?” he asked lazily.\r\n\r\n“Good.” It looked good too. He went inside for his trunks, and she\r\ncalled after him to switch the player on.\r\n\r\n“There’s a tape on already,” she said. “That new one you got.”\r\n\r\nThe soft beat of African drums was beginning when he came back out.\r\nLisa sprawled in the grass past the pool, and with each beat, she\r\nraised herself higher, till as the tempo grew furious and swelled into\r\ncrashing crescendos she was moving swiftly in a whirling ecstasy of\r\nliquid orange flame and streaked black shadow.\r\n\r\nIt was a long time since she had danced for him this way, he realized\r\nabruptly. She danced by herself, or unselfconsciously in front of him,\r\nall the time; but this was a performance--planned, staged, presented\r\nfor his pleasure. He sat back and let the poetry of her pervade all his\r\nsenses.\r\n\r\nWhen the dance was done, she fell in a huddled heap at his feet, the\r\nfingers of one hand outstretched to almost-grasp his toes. She lay so\r\nstill that he hardly dared breathe, while the memory of sound died.\r\n\r\nThen she opened one eye, half-raised her head, grinned, and winked at\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“Swim?” she said.\r\n\r\n“You’re on.”\r\n\r\nAs they climbed out of the pool, she asked, casually, as if were\r\nsomething they’d just stopped talking about, “Still want to go to the\r\nMoon?”\r\n\r\n“Sure,” he said quickly. “Why don’t we make it a honeymoon trip?”\r\n\r\nHe saw the tautness begin in her face, and he had to do _some_thing:\r\n“Christ!” he said, “What a tin-pan-alley bonanza. Song called ‘Do You\r\nWant a Moon Honeymoon, Honey?’ We’ll make a million, babe!”\r\n\r\n“Get a good old-fashioned Turkey In The Straw type tune for it,” she\r\ncame back, “and the callers can say, ‘Everybody rise an’ shine, for\r\n_Moon Honeymoon, Honey_--’” But the troubled tension was still there.\r\nAnd he could feel it stretching the skin on his own face now. “--On the\r\nother hand,” she said, too lightly, “I always did want to live in sin\r\nwith a Man in the Moon.”\r\n\r\n_Okay, let it go, the kid’s trying_.... “You mean you’d rather have the\r\nwedding _after_ the honeymoon?” he persisted compulsively. “It’s kind\r\nof--unconventional, Lee--” _Stop! For krissake, stop!_\r\n\r\n“I never commit myself to more than one drastic action before four\r\nP.M.,” she said primly.\r\n\r\n_Commit yourself?_ Well, that was that. _Neatly done, babe_, he\r\nthought. And then remembered that _he_ was the one who had started the\r\nMoon bit.\r\n\r\nOkay. Okay, they’d go. What the hell? The Moon was just part of the\r\nEarth’s backyard, that’s all. Right across the street, nothing else.\r\n\r\nOkay, they’d go.\r\n\r\n“Okay, babe,” he said, stepping toward her. “But if you won’t have me,\r\nI don’t know what I can do about it, except for _me_ to have you....”\r\n\r\n    Rockland, N.Y.\r\n    July 25, 1977\r\n\r\n  Dear Chris--\r\n\r\n  You guessed it, I suppose, as soon as you saw the envelope. (I\r\n  suppose this is what they really mean by a ‘dilatory correspondence?’\r\n  I’ve gotten to feel as if I’ve known you for years, just through\r\n  exchanging delaying letters--)\r\n\r\n  Turns out now we can’t do it on the 31st. Johnny got some sort of\r\n  (hush-hush) job onto the drawing board today, and they’ve got to have\r\n  it Aug. 3, he says. Has to take his first plans in Saturday, and then\r\n  he could leave, if they like what he’s done, but he won’t go until he\r\n  sees the final blueprints, so--\r\n\r\n  Frankly, as you realized (from what you said in your note last week),\r\n  I can’t really say I’m sorry to see him so wrapped up in new work.\r\n  But must confess I am getting kind of wistful about the trip up too--\r\n\r\n  Anyhow, I rearranged my own schedule as soon as he told me about this\r\n  last night, and have now got things set so the recording series will\r\n  be finished by Aug. 5--working all next week like mad--so that _I_\r\n  won’t have any dates I can’t break, and I’ll be free to pick up and\r\n  go any week after this coming one, any time Johnny can tear himself\r\n  away from the drawing board.\r\n\r\n  Did Phil finally make it? I know he’s been champing at the bit the\r\n  past week or so, since he made up his mind to the trip.\r\n\r\n  (Just phoned his office, found out he took off yesterday.)\r\n\r\n  Tell him hello from us, and I hope the whole thing works out. He\r\n  never said whether it would mean his staying up there or not, but\r\n  I gather this trip is just a visit anyhow? Maybe we’ll make it up\r\n  before he leaves--?\r\n\r\n  _Do_ give him regards, anyhow.\r\n\r\n    Very best, and from J.,\r\n    Lisa\r\n\r\n  P.S. Will assume any date after the 31st is okay, unless you let us\r\n  know otherwise....\r\n\r\n    L\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mexcity--July 27, 1977_\r\n\r\n“I guess they’re not going to pick up on it,” the General admitted.\r\n\r\n“You can’t win _every_ time,” Prentiss said.\r\n\r\n“I know. But how many battles lose a war? Any bright thoughts?”\r\n\r\n“Only complicated ones.”\r\n\r\n“Okay. Even not-so-bright. Something is better than nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it’s not _that_ complicated, I guess. Just tricky. Pick up on it\r\nourselves.”\r\n\r\n“You mean plant it?” Harbridge was thoughtful. “No,” he said. “Too\r\nrisky. If we got caught out on the first plant, so we’re devious\r\nbastards with something up our sleeves. If we didn’t do the first one,\r\nand got caught on this, we’re not so devious, and it’s obvious we’re\r\nout to get Christensen. If we got caught on both, it would smell real\r\nfunny--and too many people have good noses in this town--hey!”\r\n\r\n“Something?”\r\n\r\n“I think so. This thing is a windfall to anyone who’s after Chris’\r\nhide. Or it ought to look that way, if they were just looking. I think\r\nyou did too good a job, Al. They just didn’t realize there was anything\r\nthere _shouldn’t_ have been in that article.” Which shows just how much\r\n_any_one is worried about what goes on up there, he thought. Chris used\r\nto keep an eye on his public relations, but he’s been out of touch too\r\nmuch. Well, let’s give a push--“I think--let’s see, that Dartmouth\r\nboy we got shoved at us, what’s his name?, Jennings? Yuh. He’s Andy\r\nJennings’ son?” Prentiss nodded. “Okay. That’s it. I _think_ this kid\r\nis just dumb enough so if you clucked at him about the kind of leaks\r\nthat let important stuff like that get out, he’d be very likely to\r\ngo home and tell his pop. And in view of the fact that Andy Jennings\r\njust bought himself a small interest worth a half million dollars in\r\nUndersea, I think we might just get our work done for us.”\r\n\r\n“You think Jennings can remember a whole sentence that long? I mean,\r\nget home and tell it straight?”\r\n\r\n“Well you better make it _very_ clear.” The General laughed.\r\n\r\nPrentiss went out to find young Jennings, and Jed sat down to write to\r\nChris.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dollars Dome--July 28, 1977_\r\n\r\nNESNETSIRHC .RD said the lettering on the translucent plastic door and\r\nthen, underneath it, ROTCERID HCRAESER. Nature’s own idiot, spelled\r\nbackwards, the Director thought. Peter Andrew Christensen, Big Brain.\r\nIf you’re so smart, why aren’t you a University President? Or Research\r\nDirector for General Atomics? Or a respectable dues-paid master\r\nplumber, maybe?\r\n\r\nIrritably, he flipped the reader switch and swung his chair ninety\r\ndegrees to the glowing screen beside his desk, where Lisa Trovi’s\r\nragged typing explained, as adequately as possible, why the visit had\r\nto be postponed _again_. He flipped the frame, and got Jed Harbridge’s\r\ncarefully composed message on the screen. Might as well start writing\r\nanswers--get them on the shuttle back. He sat, thought about what to\r\ntell Jed, and flipped back to Lisa’s note. Switched on the dictaphone,\r\nand thought some more.\r\n\r\nKnock on the door. “Come in!” The shadow behind the panel moved, and\r\nthe door opened. “Oh, Phil.” _Good._ He turned off both machines.\r\n\r\n“Busy? I can come back....”\r\n\r\n“You couldn’t have picked a better time. I’ve just been sitting here\r\nstewing in my own juices--such as are left. Sit down. What’s on your\r\nmind?”\r\n\r\n“Questions, mostly.”\r\n\r\n“Like...?”\r\n\r\n“Like, to start with, what’s in _your_ mind?”\r\n\r\nChris grinned briefly. “You decided I’m a case too?”\r\n\r\n“Sure. What of? If it’s all the same with you, I haven’t had an\r\nagoraphobiac in a long time....”\r\n\r\n“You know, I might’ve been better off that way.” He laughed. “What can\r\nI do for you outside of that? I don’t suppose you’ve had time enough\r\nyet to have any idea....”\r\n\r\n“Pretty damn good idea,” Phil broke in cheerfully. “I’ll do you up a\r\nproper report when I get back down, but I can tell you offhand now that\r\nI think any kind of half-decent psych staff up here could solve most of\r\nthe problem, without half trying. In fact, the most interesting damn\r\nthing about it isn’t the diseases, but the patients. They _don’t want_\r\nto be sick. I’ve never seen a more co-operative group in my life. It’s\r\na headshrinker’s heaven, man!”\r\n\r\n“That right?” Chris thought it over. “Well. Of course, I guess it helps\r\nto start out with a high IQ level and--” He broke off at the doctor’s\r\namused headshake.\r\n\r\n“Chris, if you asked me before I came up here I’d have said you\r\n_couldn’t_ take a batch of human beings, selected for ability rather\r\nthan stability, and shut ’em up in an enclosed system where the\r\nenvironment violates every bit of early conditioning, and expect any\r\nthing but Trouble, with a capital T. You did it. Which proves only that\r\nmy preconceptions are as useless as yours or anybody else’s.”\r\n\r\n“You think we’re in pretty good shape, then?”\r\n\r\n“No. _Astonishingly_ good shape. I have never seen a group of human\r\nbeings working with such a high integration of aims and abilities;\r\nor expressing their own emotions so satisfactorily, with so little\r\napparent hostility--or in such good physical shape, for the most part,\r\nconsidering the unfamiliar conditions.”\r\n\r\n“Well, of course, those rest-leaves have a lot to do with it,” Chris\r\nconceded.\r\n\r\n“I’ll bet. If it wasn’t for that, I couldn’t honestly even consider\r\ntaking the job. I’ve been counting noses, and I figure there are enough\r\nof ’em ready to try giving up their leaves so I can count on a few\r\ncases, anyhow....”\r\n\r\nIt finally penetrated. “Say! Do you mean you’ve decided?”\r\n\r\n“I haven’t decided anything. I just want to know: where and how do I\r\napply for employment around here? And _which_ is more to the point?”\r\n\r\n“You mean it?” The depression that had weighed on him for the\r\npast week, and had hung so thickly in the air all morning that it\r\nimmobilized him, began to lift. “Damn it, that’s great! Never mind the\r\nemployment office, you’re hired! How much do you want and--?”\r\n\r\n“Who-a-oa.... Like I said, first I want to know what I’m hired _for_.”\r\n\r\n“How do you mean?” Chris asked slowly. “We went all through that to\r\nstart with...?”\r\n\r\n“That was the official request. Now suppose we lay it on the line\r\nfor each other. I don’t think you’d sacrifice any work-time up here\r\njust to solve the pro-tem personnel problem. And I frankly would not\r\nbe interested in giving up a fairly well-established and moderately\r\nlucrative Earthside practice, just to solve your hiring problems.\r\nYou’ve got your own reasons, and I’ve got mine, but I think what we’re\r\nboth interested in is finding out how to make human beings tolerate\r\nlife off of Earth--here, or on Mars, or in a starship or any other\r\nplace. Do I read you right, friend?”\r\n\r\n“Well--I’ll--be--damned!” He looked across the desk at the young doctor\r\nwith a new respect. “Am I all _that_ transparent?”\r\n\r\nPhil smiled. “Let’s just say I’m a trained observer.”\r\n\r\n“No, I mean it,” Chris said earnestly. “Does it all show right out\r\nthere on my face? I mean, I can see where you’d know what was going\r\non--but I’d hate to think of some of these Decagon jerks or the buggers\r\ndown in Accounting knowing everything I thought about--”\r\n\r\n“Relax, man! No, it doesn’t show that much, Chris. Like I said, I’m a\r\ntrained observer, and--” He broke into laughter. “Don’t worry, Chris.\r\nUnless you go around feeding the Decagon boys the same stories you gave\r\nme, I doubt they’d be fretting about your intentions. You gave it away\r\nwhen you dragged Johnny into it. Or rather, you got me hooked that\r\nway, so it wasn’t too hard to figure maybe you _meant_ what you said.\r\nI don’t know if I’d have read it the same way at all, if I didn’t have\r\nthis jazzy old Johnny-monkey on _my_ back--so to speak.”\r\n\r\nWell, what in hell did you say to something like that? “Oh! By the\r\nway--I have another note from Lisa today. Begins to look like they\r\nwon’t make it at all, the rate he’s stalling.” He had a sudden worried\r\nthought. “I hope that wasn’t what you were counting on--?”\r\n\r\n“Noooooo. Tell you the truth, I never figured that was better than an\r\noutside chance. Last I heard, he still was flipping his lid if anyone\r\neven _talked_ about space. I don’t know how he’d face up to the trip\r\nout here.”\r\n\r\n“Yeah, I know.” He was thinking of Lisa’s frantic efforts to control\r\nthe conversation that one night at their home--to keep away from\r\n_any_thing that bothered John. He scowled. “As a matter of fact you\r\ncould’ve knocked me over with any handy feather when I got that first\r\nletter from him, but I guess--dammit!” He cut himself off, and switched\r\non the reader speaker briefly.\r\n\r\n“Note: If John Wendt comes up, he is to have sedation for full trip.\r\nCopies to all Earth launch sites. Request special handling. Full\r\nsedation, delivered as much as possible according to pre-Messenger\r\nroutine, without comment, as if still normal procedure. That’s all.\r\n\r\n“Excuse me,” he said to the doctor. “I’ve been meaning to get that\r\nnotice out ever since he said he was coming. Didn’t want to forget it\r\nagain. I just don’t want to take any chances.”\r\n\r\n“Good idea,” Phil nodded, then, explosively: “Damn it to hell anyhow!”\r\n\r\n“That boy really is under your skin, hey?” He watched the doctor’s face\r\nwith interest; it was the first time he had seen the professional mask\r\ncompletely gone.\r\n\r\n“Well, hell, we were old buddies, and--That’s not it, though, really. I\r\nused to be fond of Johnny, but I don’t think that’s even specially true\r\nany more. It’s just--well, put it this way:\r\n\r\n“Suppose a patient comes in and tells me he keeps imagining that he’s\r\nchained to the floor of a dungeon and that a gorgeous babe comes in\r\nevery evening to give him a good time? Chances are, I’ll nod my head\r\nlike a wise old doctor and start explaining about erotic fantasies,\r\nmasochism, and all that. _But_--\r\n\r\n“Supposing, for instance, this guy really _is_ getting chained up every\r\nnight, and this gorgeous doll really _is_ raping him each time? It’s\r\nso damn unlikely, the guy might even think he was dreaming if it _did_\r\nhappen. Right?\r\n\r\n“_Or_--supposing this fellow was sure enough imagining things, only\r\nhe wasn’t having erotic or masochistic fantasies at all? Like, let’s\r\nsay he works in a bicycle chain factory, and hates his job, and maybe\r\nthere’s a supervisor who’s a beautiful dish, and she’s always giving\r\nhim a hard time. So maybe his fantasies are fear and revenge instead?\r\n\r\n“Okay, so this I’d find out a lot easier than I would anything about\r\nthe guy who’s really getting tied up. But that’s because everybody\r\ntalks about their jobs and bosses, on the couch or off it. So you take\r\nJohnny Wendt, and Doug Laughlin for that matter, too. Here are two guys\r\nwho got psych-tested inside out and upside down before they left. They\r\nalso got all kinds of training and preparation for the things they\r\nmight encounter, and I’ve taken the trouble to find out--you probably\r\nalready know--that homosexuality was an eventuality the training\r\nprogram prepared them to cope with. Plus, neither one of them showed\r\nany appreciable tendency to panic over anything like that, if it _did_\r\nhappen.”\r\n\r\n“Okay. I know all that,” Chris said. “It still happens to be what\r\n_did_ happen. So, like with the guy who really gets the chains and\r\nthe babe, maybe there was something in the psychological--I don’t\r\nknow--atmosphere?--that we couldn’t prepare for and don’t know about,\r\nand--Hell, whatever the reason was, at least you found out _what_\r\nhappened. _Why_ is something else.”\r\n\r\n“Sure as hell is,” Kutler said wryly. “And maybe you’re right that what\r\nJohnny--or rather, Johnny’s unconscious--thinks happened _did_ happen.\r\nOnly I don’t think so. I find it easier to think there was something\r\nin the _physical_ environment which was just so completely different\r\nand new and unprepared for that maybe neither one of them could even\r\nperceive it fully; and to the half-assed extent that they were aware of\r\nit at all, they interpreted it by association of some kind and--I just\r\nwish to hell Laughlin hadn’t torn those pages out! If we knew what _he_\r\nthought was the matter, it might--Well, hell, forget it. I just thought\r\nyou might like to know what’s pushin’ _me_.”\r\n\r\n“Yeah. Thanks.” There ought to be something better to say, he thought.\r\n“Tell you what: _you_ get the money for the next trip, and I’ll see to\r\nit you get to go in person.”\r\n\r\nKutler shrugged and smiled. “It’s a deal. Meanwhile, suppose I start on\r\nmy elementary-school work up here? Your people have problems people on\r\nEarth don’t have. Maybe they have nothing to do with Johnny’s troubles.\r\nOr maybe they do. But the principle is the same. When you already know\r\nfive languages, the next three are easier to learn. If I find out what\r\none-sixth gravity and Dome atmosphere do to people, maybe I’m that much\r\ncloser to what one-third and a Mars atmosphere can do?”\r\n\r\n“I take it,” Chris said slowly, “that what you mean is you want the\r\njob, and you’ll do what you’re hired for, but with the understanding\r\nthat you expect to be free to do more than that, too?”\r\n\r\n“Man, you dig me the most!”\r\n\r\n“Okay. Let me lay it on the line now, and make sure we _both_ know what\r\ngoes on. When I first thought of you for the job, it was mainly because\r\nI knew you were bugged about Johnny. Well so am I. But a different way.\r\nFrankly, if we never find out what happened to Doug or to Johnny, it\r\ndon’t make no never mind for me--just _so_ we can get the next guys\r\nback alive--and get ’em _there_, to start with.”\r\n\r\nHe stood up and walked around the desk; turned and went back and stood\r\nat his own seat looking at the doctor across the desk top. “Listen,\r\nPhil, you talk about me being ‘a case.’ Well, I am one, all right,\r\nand I guess you know it as well as I do. Johnny was my friend. So was\r\nDoug. But I’d send ’em again, even if I knew it would happen the same\r\nway again--unless I knew some _better_ men to send. And I figure I\r\nowe Johnny a whole lot now--but that comes second with me. If it came\r\nfirst, I’d leave him alone, I guess.”\r\n\r\n“I think you might do a lot more for Johnny by _not_ leaving him\r\nalone,” Kutler broke in.\r\n\r\n“Good. Only it’s still secondary. I’ve been busting a gut to get him\r\nback on the job with us, but you know as well as I do _why_ I want him.\r\nIt all comes down to Congress, the Care and Feeding Of.”\r\n\r\n“I know,” the doctor said slowly, “Okay, so while we’re showing our\r\ncards, let me add this: that’s one of the reasons I want this job.\r\n_Another_ one of the reasons. I know what you’re trying to do--but I\r\ndon’t want to see Johnny fouled up any more either.”\r\n\r\n“Okay, so stick around and keep an eye on me. That’s all right too.\r\nThe way it is right now, Kutler, I can see a good chance of every damn\r\nthing we’ve done so far going right swoosh down the drain for God only\r\nknows how long--another ten, twenty, thirty years, maybe. Unless the\r\nReds make it, that is--”\r\n\r\n“Yeah, that’s something else. What’s _with_ them over there? You’ve had\r\nthese bugs Johnny brought back and the other stuff to work on--I take\r\nit the bugs get the most attention now?” Chris nodded. “So what are\r\nthey doing there? They run shuttles up and down, and from what I saw\r\ncoming up, and the scuttlebutt hither and yon, there’s enough espionage\r\ngoing on to support a half dozen space programs. So what are they\r\n_doing_?”\r\n\r\n“I wish to hell I knew! About the only thing I’m pretty sure of is,\r\nthey haven’t got anything big going out soon. If they _did_--well,\r\nfrankly, I’d be the last to know. But the Decagon boys would know all\r\nabout it before the New Kremlin did, I’ll guarantee. Then maybe we’d\r\nsee some changes here too. _Maybe, hell!_ That’s the _only_ thing that\r\nwould get us off the ground again, the way it is now.”\r\n\r\n“_A la_ Sputnik?”\r\n\r\nChris nodded. “_And_ Muttnik, _and_ Lunik, _and_ Mechta--and the\r\n_Lenin_, for that matter. Frankly, Phil--” He hesitated. It was\r\ntempting to talk to this man; it would be a damn big help to have\r\n_someone_ to talk to. But--“I wonder if some of the big-scare reaction\r\nto the whole _Lenin-Colombo_ bust wasn’t--encouraged a little? After\r\nall, Johnny _did_ bring the ship back. It _went_ to Mars. It came\r\n_back_. He’s alive, in one piece, sane--as much as anyone, I guess?”\r\n\r\nPhil nodded, smiling.\r\n\r\n“So why the big scare? The way it adds to me--bearing in mind that\r\nI’m a wild-eyed scientist, see? Not a politico--” He grinned. “I keep\r\nthinking, the _Colombo_ puts us one-up. As long as they don’t make\r\nanother move, we stay one-up. As far as the politicians go, that means\r\nthe Space Program has done its bit for God and country--for now,\r\nanyhow. And meantime, for this new Undersea Corporation.... And the\r\nArctic Circle crowd has some big money behind it too. So why throw\r\naway the taxpayers’ hard-earned loot on spaceships? No profits, no\r\nporkbarrel, not even any damn propaganda value. See?”\r\n\r\n“That figures,” Kutler said thoughtfully. “So?”\r\n\r\n“So I don’t know. I’m just trying everything I have. Or can get.\r\nIncluding--” He hovered on the brink of filling in the rest of the\r\npicture, and decided against it. Not till he knew Phil Kutler a little\r\nmore. And not till Harbridge was fully committed. “Including you, and\r\nWendt, and the psych program and the bug research, and anything else I\r\ncan dream up that might either be some _real_ help, or might work to\r\npush Congress the right way, or both.”\r\n\r\n“But right now if you have to make a choice, what counts is the\r\npropaganda end of it?”\r\n\r\n“Frankly--yes.”\r\n\r\n“Okay.” The doctor stood up. “I just like to know what I’m doing when I\r\ndo it. Where do I sign up?”\r\n\r\nChris stood too and held out his hand. “You just did. I’ll get the\r\ncontracts and stuff taken care of. When do you think you can start?”\r\n\r\n“Hard to say for sure. As soon as possible--could be two weeks, could\r\nbe six. I can’t make the move till I get my patients settled with other\r\nmen. Call it three-four weeks, with moderate luck.”\r\n\r\n“From when you go down?” Chris frowned. Add a week and a half, and it\r\nwas going to run right into September anyhow.\r\n\r\nKutler nodded. “Is it too late to catch the Messenger back this trip?”\r\n\r\nHe hadn’t thought of that. “No. The passenger shuttles don’t leave till\r\nevening anyhow. But don’t you need more time--?”\r\n\r\n“What for? I had my case histories before I came up, and I’d already\r\nseen twenty-five per cent of your people. I’ve seen enough up here now\r\nto know there’s a job to do, and I want to do it. The rest can wait.”\r\n\r\nChris nodded. _Damn it, I like this guy!_ He thought. Then he\r\nremembered. He switched on the deskreader and flicked back to Lisa’s\r\nletter. “Say, I almost forgot, Lee sent you all kinds of regards.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe was ridiculously conscious of Chris’ eyes on his face as he read,\r\nand of his own determinedly neutral expression.\r\n\r\nThe note was typically Lisa: the wording, punctuation, even the typing,\r\nheld that quality of--what?--mock-effrontery?--that had drawn him so\r\nstrongly that day in front of the restaurant.\r\n\r\nThen he got to the bottom, and smiled. Great little intriguer _she’d_\r\nmake--like real subtle messages, hey?\r\n\r\n“I take it she thinks I should haul out of here before Buster gets on\r\nboard,” he murmured.\r\n\r\n“Well, you thought so too, didn’t you?”\r\n\r\nHe nodded and glanced at the other man’s face. _Just what is it that\r\ngirl’s got?_ he wondered again. _And what difference does it make?\r\nNever mind her ... what about him?_\r\n\r\n“Looks like _some_thing’s going on with our boy, anyhow,” he said\r\ncarefully. “Maybe my hunch wasn’t all the way off after all. I’m glad\r\nyou got up there, Chris. Maybe you scared him back to work at least.”\r\n_Unless she meant “sideboard” where she wrote “drawing board.”_\r\n\r\nChris switched off the screen. “That’s quite a gal,” he said--a shade\r\ntoo casually.\r\n\r\n“First time you met her?” Phil asked.\r\n\r\n“Yup.” _Very_ casual now. “What’s with those two, Phil? I mean--” He\r\nlet it trail off.\r\n\r\nPhil shrugged and refrained from smiling. “I guess the girl knows what\r\nshe wants,” he said noncommitally.\r\n\r\n“I mean--well, hell, what’s the deal? How come he doesn’t break down\r\nand propose?”\r\n\r\nThis time he let himself smile. “He does. Every day and twice on\r\nTuesdays, the way I hear it. _She’s_ the one who won’t play.”\r\n\r\nChris looked up sharply. “What the hell--?”\r\n\r\n“Look, I’m not telling any stories out of school; I would have thought\r\nyou’d know that much anyhow. Don’t your people keep any tabs on Wendt\r\nat all?”\r\n\r\n“Not _my_ people,” the other man said bitterly. “Just Security. And\r\nwhat they don’t tell _me_ would--would probably launch a thousand\r\nspaceships, come right down to it. Hell, I wouldn’t even know as much\r\nas I’ve told you if I didn’t take that trip Earthside last month.”\r\n\r\n“Oh?” _Well, you’ve got some connection, then._... He caught himself\r\nup, astonished at his own hostility. _Well, something new has been\r\nadded!_ Only it wasn’t new at all. The only thing was that Chris had\r\njoined the club. Phil Kutler grinned inside himself, not pleasantly.\r\n_Strange bedfellows_, he thought--_goddam strange!_\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mexcity--Thursday, August 4_\r\n\r\nThe General dictated the last letter of the morning, dismissed his\r\nsecretary with a tired pleasantry, and buzzed Al Prentiss.\r\n\r\n“You seen the papers yet?”\r\n\r\nPrentiss was in a good mood--and a good thing, Harbridge thought. He\r\nhimself was beginning to think again wistfully about the pleasures of\r\nretirement.\r\n\r\n“Only the _Times_,” he said warily. He hoped Al’s good humor was not\r\nthe fine edge of battle. This would be a good day not to get clobbered\r\nby anything.\r\n\r\n“I’ll be right in.” _Click._ That’s the trouble with civilians,\r\nHarbridge thought. No damn manners. Al came bursting in, three folded\r\nnewspapers under his arm, all early afternoon editions.\r\n\r\n“Like a charm,” he said, spreading them to the marked articles.\r\n\r\n    MOON DOME ADMINISTRATION\r\n    SCOURGED BY CONGRESSMAN\r\n\r\n    _McLafferty Will Investigate\r\n    Dome Security Practices_\r\n\r\n  Iquique, Aug. 4: Representative Ramon E. McLafferty (I., E. Ch.)\r\n  announced today that he was in receipt of ‘evidence of incredible\r\n  sloppiness’ in the handling of what ought to be Top-Secret space\r\n  research projects at Moon Dome.\r\n\r\n  The Congressman, who is newly appointed Chairman of the Security\r\n  Subcommittee of the Joint Space Affairs Committee, declined to reveal\r\n  his sources, but promised an ‘immediate and vigorous investigation.’\r\n  Asked if his statement was connected in any way with his interview\r\n  earlier today with Andrew Jennings, a close neighbor and friend\r\n  of Rep. McLafferty in the northern mountains, the Industrialist\r\n  Congressman refused to comment....\r\n\r\nThat was the gist of them all, except for one columnist’s item: “Ray\r\nMcLafferty will gain a lot of momentum for the Senatorial elections\r\nthis fall, if the Moon Dome hearings turn out half as popular as you’d\r\nthink. Not to mention a well-known neighbor of Ray’s who has what you\r\nmight call a small interest in persuading Congress that some of the\r\nSpace Research funds could be better applied under water....”\r\n\r\nHarbridge chuckled. The day was not going to be so bad after all. “I\r\nhope it doesn’t get _too_ rough,” he said.\r\n\r\n“It’s what the man ordered,” Prentiss reminded him.\r\n\r\n“I know. I just hope it doesn’t get too rough. I forgot about\r\nMcLafferty.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART FIVE\r\n\r\n_August 24, 1977_\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dollars Dome--6_ P.M. (_C.S.T._)\r\n\r\nThey had buckled her into the comfortable safeness of the couch, and\r\nshe had swallowed a pill, and then vaguely felt the faint prick in her\r\narm.\r\n\r\nThere had been dreams and dreamy times and maybe-dreams which were\r\nhard to sort out, but as she came more awake, she decided the\r\ntruly-half-awake times had been only the ones where she swallowed what\r\nsomeone told her to, and float-walked to the toilet and back again.\r\n\r\nShe was very hungry. Somebody came and unstrapped her arms, and left\r\nher to free herself after that from the rest of the fastenings. She sat\r\nup stiffly, stood up on prickling feet, and stepped into the corridor.\r\nA whitecoated young man looked horrified, came running at her.\r\n\r\n“Sorry, Miss, I didn’t think you’d be up so quick.”\r\n\r\nVaguely, she recognized him--or his jacket?--as the one who’d\r\nunfastened her. Then, with a rush of clarity, she saw it was Johnny\r\nhe’d been standing with down the corridor. She stepped forward and\r\nwhitejacket caught her arm.\r\n\r\n“Steady--”\r\n\r\n“I’m all right.” She took another step, and the prickling began to\r\nease. Johnny didn’t look any better than she felt.\r\n\r\n“Home was never like this,” she muttered.\r\n\r\n“Huh? Feeling rocky, babe?” His face was gray but he was a lot steadier\r\non his feet. “Takes getting used to,” he said, but he didn’t sound as\r\nif it made much difference. He wasn’t even looking at her. He kept\r\nstaring at the couch behind him.\r\n\r\nShe stood still. _Getting my Moon legs_, she thought nervously, and\r\nwished the damn whitejacket character would go away, or Johnny would\r\nkiss her, or preferably both.\r\n\r\n“Hello?” she said, smallvoiced, and put her hand on his arm.\r\n\r\n“Hi, babe.” He turned and really looked at her this time, and\r\nclosed his other hand over hers. “Better yet? I was just looking at\r\nthis setup--didn’t get a chance when we boarded. It’s changed some\r\nsince--They’ve improved it a lot, but it seems to me there should\r\nbe something better than all this belt-and-buckle junk. There must\r\nbe some kind of synthetic fabric that would do the job,” he said\r\nthoughtfully. “See, if you had--”\r\n\r\n_If I had half a brain_, she thought, turning the mounting irritation\r\nback on herself, _I’d have stopped to think_ I’m _not the one who needs\r\ncoddling this time!_\r\n\r\n“--made up into a net--soft enough for comfort, but rigid--”\r\n\r\nHe was keeping his brain busy. _Fine. But what happens next?_\r\n\r\n“--enough to hold shape on a frame, you could work the whole thing with\r\na pushbutton--”\r\n\r\nThe whitejacket type looked as impatient as she felt.\r\n\r\n“--Give it a kind of dead man’s brake,” Johnny rattled on, impervious,\r\n“so it won’t work during blast--”\r\n\r\nWhitejacket gave her a pleading look. She took a deep breath. “Hey,”\r\nshe said. “Mister! You know which way to the Dome? I’m a stranger here\r\nmyself--”\r\n\r\nHe grinned, shook his head as if to wake himself up. “Sure. Right down\r\nthis aisle, lady. Step right through the double doorway to your right\r\n... ea-ea-ea-zee does it. You are now breathing the fresh pure air\r\nof Kansas City, imported direct to the Moon for the benefit of Dr.\r\nChristensen’s walking talking researching exiles. Siberia was never\r\nlike this either. Well, how do you like it?”\r\n\r\n_I don’t know_, she thought. _I’m too busy liking you._ She made\r\nherself stand still, not look around. If she looked, if she seemed to\r\nnotice anything different, it would go away. _Oh, Johnny!_ she thought,\r\nremembering suddenly, sharply, the man who had gone to Mars.\r\n\r\n_But he’s still that way, lots of times_, she defended automatically,\r\neven to herself; and told herself right back, _Sure he is--on Earth!_\r\nBut they weren’t on Earth: they were on the Moon, and Johnny hadn’t\r\neven been able to listen to _talk_ about space for a year and a half\r\nnow without flipping his lid....\r\n\r\n_Never mind_, she stopped herself. She didn’t have to understand it;\r\nshe could just be grateful for it.\r\n\r\n“All right, snotty, _be_ blasé,” she said aloud. “Me, I’m a greenhorn.\r\nI’m impressed.” And she was, too. Startling, how anything could be so\r\nmuch like what you expected, but so much--what--so much more _real_.\r\nLike seeing art-book reproductions of Degas’ dancers, and suddenly\r\nfinding yourself in front of a full-scale canvas, alive with the breath\r\nand brush of the artist. And even now, all she was seeing was through\r\nthe protective refraction of the great air dome. She wondered if\r\nvisitors could ever get outside....\r\n\r\n“Hey, babe, stop staring and come say hello to the nice man.”\r\n\r\nShe turned and smiled at Chris, with what she meant to be only a\r\nsideways glance at Johnny. His face was open and relaxed and easy ... a\r\nface she remembered from long long ago, and saw now only for fleeting\r\nmoments in great privacy and dim light. But even while she watched, it\r\ndisappeared under the familiar mask.\r\n\r\n“You’ll have to excuse the lady,” he was saying to Chris. “It’s her\r\nfirst experience as visiting firelady off the planet of her birth,\r\nand....”\r\n\r\n“I’m just Moon-struck,” she broke in. “Hello, Chris. I ... it ... well,\r\n_thanks_ for asking us.”\r\n\r\n“Believe me, it’s a pleasure to see you.” He reached out a big hand,\r\nand took hers in it, then released her to shake hands with Johnny.\r\n“Having any trouble walking? Good. Those shoe plates are supposed to\r\nmake just enough difference, but gravity and magnetism aren’t exactly\r\nthe same. Some people have trouble at first. Come on. Got some chow\r\nwaiting for you. Even the Moon has traditions. Banquet in the dining\r\nroom every time a ship comes in.”\r\n\r\nThey were walking across a curious concrete flooring, flecked with\r\nsparkling bits of silvery stuff, away from the dome and wall, the great\r\nair-lock “gate” through which they had entered, leaving the two tall\r\nships and the Moon-vista behind them as they approached the center of\r\nthe base.\r\n\r\nThe shiny bits in the floor must be the magnetizing element, she\r\ndecided, and became pleasantly aware of the difference Chris had\r\nmentioned. She felt light, buoyant, fluidly effortless in all her\r\nmovements--but still her feet behaved as they were accustomed to\r\nbehaving under normal gravity.\r\n\r\n“I guess the people who feel uncomfortable walking must be the ones\r\nwith feet out of proportion to their bodies,” she said thoughtfully,\r\nremembering how the plates had been carefully trimmed to size and\r\nattached to her shoes at the spaceport on Earth. “I mean, if your\r\nfeet were a little small, the surface wouldn’t give you quite as much\r\nattraction as you needed to make it feel the same...?”\r\n\r\nChris nodded. “We have special plates made up with thicker soles for\r\noverweight people, if they’re staying on. Although, once you get used\r\nto the idea, it’s kind of fun not to use them at all.” He smiled. “You\r\nsee what kind of solitary pleasures a man is reduced to in a setup\r\nlike this? But I can’t very well go floating around the place where\r\nthe hired hands can see me, so I only do it when I’m alone in the\r\nexecutive suite,” he added, to Johnny, and went on: “Listen, if you\r\nfolks would rather skip the love-feast today, we can have something\r\nsent up to my place. Whatever you’d rather--?”\r\n\r\n“Makes no difference,” Johnny said curtly. “Whatever you want. They’ll\r\nbe expecting you, won’t they?”\r\n\r\nShe heard the tightness in his voice, shot a quick unnecessary look at\r\nhis face, and did her duty: “Frankly, I _would_ appreciate it if it’s\r\nnot too much trouble,” she lied. “I’m ... kind of dazed.” _That_ was no\r\nlie.\r\n\r\n“Sure thing. Wait here a minute, will you?” Chris stepped off more\r\nbriskly in the direction they had been going, caught up with a group\r\na little way ahead, and spoke quickly to a tall gangling redhead in\r\nshorts and a violent patterned shirt. The redhead glanced back at them,\r\nnodded, and rejoined his group. Chris came back, smiling, and they\r\nturned off the wide main “street,” down a side corridor, heading “out”\r\nagain now, toward a different part of the dome wall. A little later\r\nthey turned again, and lost sight of the outside, walking up a ramp\r\nthat led to another corridor, this one lined with doors. Chris paused\r\nin front of the last door along the row, and pushed it open.\r\n\r\nLisa took one step inside and gasped. Her first impressions of the\r\nroom itself were vague. That didn’t matter. She was facing a full wall\r\nsection of the dome. From floor to ceiling, and perhaps eighteen feet\r\nalong the side, the clear plastic brought the incredible outside right\r\nin with them.\r\n\r\nShe heard Chris laugh, and Johnny said, “Hey, babe, you’re obstructing\r\ntraffic.” She stepped forward to let them in, but never moved her eyes.\r\nThe only thing she thought about at all in that brief time of pure\r\nperception was to wish that Chris would go away, so she could know if\r\nJohnny was sharing her delight. Then Chris went away.\r\n\r\n“’Scuse me. Check messages ’noffice,” he said. Or something like that.\r\nHe vanished through a side door, and she took her eyes off the outside\r\nlong enough to look to Johnny and reach out her hand. He stepped\r\ncloser, took her hand in his own, and stood next to her, seeing it with\r\nher--but just for an instant; then he stepped away.\r\n\r\nAwareness of his movements around the room intruded gradually on her\r\npreoccupation. She turned, and found him studying the titles in a\r\nbookshelf; looked around herself, and took in a low couch, table,\r\ncomfortable looking sling chair. Another table, writing height, in the\r\nfar side of the room, with a straight chair in front of it. Everything\r\nelse was built in: shelves, drawers, cupboards.\r\n\r\nNo pictures. She was beginning to approve of Pete Christensen. Anyone\r\nwho’d hang a picture on a wall in the same room with what she’d just\r\nbeen looking at....\r\n\r\nDinner was the biggest surprise yet, because it was so normal--normal\r\nfor Earthside luxury, that is. It arrived, scant minutes after Chris\r\nhad mixed and served cocktails, on a hotel-type wheeled table, which\r\ncame up in a sort of oversized dumbwaiter. On a plastic cloth, plastic\r\ndishes and earthenware containers held what was literally the banquet\r\nChris had promised: appetizer to mints, with all stops in between,\r\nand roast beef featured in the middle. _Plus_ a wine she could not\r\nidentify, but found delightful.\r\n\r\n“Our own brand,” Chris chuckled. “So was the ‘gin.’ For that matter,\r\ndamn near everything on the table is. I’m not sure offhand whether\r\nthe dishes were made here or not, but the ceramic stuff was. And the\r\nplastic cloth. _And_ the roast beef.”\r\n\r\nShe had known about the hydroponics farm, and there was really nothing\r\nstartling, if you thought about it, at the idea that where man can grow\r\nstarch, he can, and will, also distill spirits. “Which tank do you grow\r\nyour beef in?” She asked skeptically.\r\n\r\n“No tank,” he said, beaming. “That pink slice represents one of our\r\nbiggest scores to date, gal. Experiment in transporting animals _in\r\nutero_. First viable one we got was a pig--wouldn’t you know it? But\r\nwe have practically a complete livestock farm here now, and we’ve got\r\nthe process down to where we--” He stopped, as if checking himself, and\r\nthen finished smoothly. “--we think we can pack up any kind of stock a\r\nspace traveler orders and ship it to him--anywhere, any time. Not bad,\r\nhey? We’re fooling around with deepfreeze now--the embryos, I mean. No\r\nluck so far, but--?”\r\n\r\nHis shrug, Lee thought, was magnificently eloquent: all around her,\r\nin front of her, even being ingested inside her, was evidence of the\r\nstubborn, determined, bull-headed damn dumb optimism of that shrug.\r\nPete Christensen had _made_ this station--fought for it, worked at it,\r\nschemed on its behalf--_made_ it almost as literally as though he’d\r\nbuilt it with his hands, unaided.\r\n\r\n“You still headin’ for the wild blue yonder, man?”\r\n\r\n_Johnny._ Lisa looked once at his tight sardonic withdrawal and thought\r\nwith a shiver:\r\n\r\n_He made_ that, _too_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dollars Dome--7:30_ P.M. (_C.S.T._)\r\n\r\n_Half an hour_, Phil thought. He’d give it another half hour, then he’d\r\nhave to go up.\r\n\r\n“You get so it seems normal,” he said in answer to the comment from one\r\nof the three new all-alike young biochemists. _How do they turn ’em\r\nout so same-all-over?_ Once upon a time, scientists at least had been\r\nodd ducks, individualists--Okay, escapists; but _individuals_. Now...?\r\n“It’s morning now, Moonwise. Just dawned yesterday. But at Moon-night,\r\nall the difference is the blinds are down--that’s the effect. The dome\r\nlights actually give you the same color and quality of light. You just\r\ncan’t see out, very far. You have to make your own day-and-night for\r\nliving purposes. That’s one of the tests you’ll be getting this week.\r\nFind out what kind of routine or schedule looks best for each one of\r\nyou, and after a while ‘night’ is the time you go to your room to\r\nsleep.” _You’ll get used to it before_ I _will, I bet_, he thought,\r\namused at the knowledgeable confidence he managed to convey.\r\n\r\n_Half an hour, at the most._ God only knows which bit of fur Chris was\r\nrubbing backwards now. _Or which way Lightning Boy will strike when ole\r\nDoc Kutler shows! Well, might as well live dangerously--if there was no\r\nsafe way to do the job._...\r\n\r\nHe confirmed the opinion of another of the triplet fledglings that\r\nthe day-night bit might be behind some of the psychogenic systemic\r\nmalfunctions he’d been warned about.\r\n\r\n“Damnedest industrial hazards popping up these days,” the third one\r\nsaid. “Used to be in our line all you worried about was catching\r\nmalaria or getting too much roentgen. Now you sign a release about\r\nasthma and psychosomatic hypertension before they’ll hire you.”\r\n\r\n“Well, that’s really my job here,” Phil said. “I’m the chief\r\nheadshrinker in charge of eustachian tubes. The day-night thing makes\r\ntrouble, but nothing like what that inner ear of yours will try to do.\r\nNot to mention all the things your involuntary reflex system has to\r\nlearn all over, and--”\r\n\r\n“You know, I never thought of just how _many_ things low gravity and\r\nrhythm disruption could do to a man!” Biochem No. 1 broke in, “Man,\r\n_that_ could be fascinating!”\r\n\r\n_Well, all right._ Phil started to feel better. At least one out of\r\nthree was not Cool Cat straight to the core. The lad had spoken out of\r\nturn, and out of character. Phil made a mental approving note and fixed\r\nthe still-nameless face in his mind. Then he stood up.\r\n\r\n“I’m going to have to run out on you for a while,” he apologized.\r\n“Boss-man has super-visitors upstairs.” No. 1 grinned; the others\r\nlooked politely baffled. _Carrera_--that was his name.\r\n\r\n“Scuttlebutt around St. Thom wasn’t so far off, I guess,” No. 2 said to\r\nNo. 3.\r\n\r\n“Everyone was saying _Johnny Wendt_ would be on board,” No. 3\r\nexplained. “Who is it anyhow? Or do we get Classified Personnel up\r\nhere?”\r\n\r\n_Johnny Wendt._ In emphasis. Even from this jerk....\r\n\r\n“Everyone was right,” Phil said flatly. “He’s up with Dr. Christensen\r\nnow.”\r\n\r\n“Oh?”\r\n\r\n“Dammit!” said No. 2. “I _know_ I’d have recognized him. I’ll swear he\r\nwasn’t on the Messenger.”\r\n\r\nPhil shrugged. “Maybe they have private luxury compartments?” he said\r\nwith a suggestion of a leer. “He brought Lisa Trovi with him.” And\r\nturned and went, knowing he had penetrated the professional boredom of\r\nNo.’s 1 and 2.\r\n\r\n_Johnny Wendt!_\r\n\r\nMaybe the boys back at the table were more jazzed up about Lee being\r\nthere--but they didn’t say her name in caps or italics. Well, he\r\nthought, it was nice to know you weren’t the _only_ sucker in town. And\r\nChristensen’s bulldoggish efforts for the first time to get Wendt’s\r\nname back on the rolls made full _objective_ sense to Phil.\r\n\r\nHe tossed a mental apology at Chris. Amendment, rather. He’d actually\r\nbegun to think the director _cared_ about Wendt.\r\n\r\nOr maybe he did; it wouldn’t matter, _if_ he did. He didn’t care enough\r\nabout _himself_ to make a centimeter’s difference if the blueprint was\r\nthe plan for space. Whether he cared or not, he _needed_ Wendt.\r\n\r\nPhil started up the stairs to see the immovable object visiting the\r\nirresistible force.\r\n\r\nPlus, of course, Lisa.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dollars Dome--8_ P.M. (_C.S.T._)\r\n\r\nThe big wheel drifted in a sunlit void. Cargo ships snuggled cozily\r\ninto the vast hub hold. Tiny toy-robots and toy-men who looked, in\r\noutspace gear, more like the robots than the robots did, clung to the\r\nouter shell, making their way in spiralling circuits around the great\r\nrim and the hub, checking, repairing, resealing the scars of cosmic\r\ndust and ultra-high-velocity pinpoint pebbles.\r\n\r\nInside the ion tubes, geiger-suited crews cleaned and inspected.\r\nFuel shuttles took their turns at the maw of the tanks. In the rim\r\nliving quarters, crew couches were stripped and sprayed, deodorized,\r\nsanitized, and u-vee’d, covered with fresh plastic sheets. A team of\r\ntwo went through inspecting straps and webbing, and buckles.\r\n\r\nAll the routine of the _Messenger’s_ two-day Moonside orbit went on\r\nas it always did. Shuttles came and went from and to the three domes.\r\nAnd as routinely as all the rest, magnetic tweezers plucked a thin\r\nstrip of microfilm from a minute wall hole; a piece of candy offered\r\nand accepted was sucked till the candycoat came off the hard center--a\r\npellet precisely shaped and sized to tonguing into the cavity of a\r\nfalse tooth; two men conversed about supplies and schedules, talking\r\nfluently meanwhile with their hands.\r\n\r\nThe shuttles went in and out, and before most of the residents of\r\nDollars Dome knew who their guests were--or that they _had_ special\r\nguests--the top man in every national delegation at World Dome, plus\r\nDr. Chen and his aides in Plato Crater, knew that _John Wendt_ had come\r\nback.\r\n\r\nThey also knew that Wendt had refused to go back into space since his\r\nfirst return from Mars--or that that was what the American government\r\n_said_. Now he was brought up, with absolute secrecy--kept in his bunk\r\nthe whole way--as a prisoner? or for Security reasons? by choice?\r\n_why?_--and that a “woman friend” had accompanied him: presumably the\r\nAmerican tri-di dancer, Trovi.\r\n\r\n_Why?_\r\n\r\nIn at least sixteen different rooms in the three man-made Moon oases,\r\nmen sat silently asking themselves the same questions, or conferring\r\nworriedly with other men about it.\r\n\r\nIn Dollars Dome, the word gradually spread too. And in Dr. Peter\r\nAndrew Christensen’s living room, Trovi and Wendt sat sipping wine and\r\ncoffee, while the Director made small talk and speculated about those\r\nsixteen--or more--rooms, and what was going on inside them all.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“... still headin’ into the wild blue yonder?” It didn’t come out\r\nlight, the way he’d meant it to. He avoided Lee’s quick look.\r\n\r\n“You seen any leopards change spots lately, John?” The bastard laughed\r\nas if the joke was on himself. Sure.\r\n\r\n_Yeah. This cat over here, man. Flyin’ tiger turned to pussy-cat.\r\nYeh-man!_\r\n\r\nThe self-made leopard looked like licking cream, rambling on to Lisa\r\nabout food again. “Food gets ridiculously important to us here,” he\r\nsaid. “But the psych boys had that taped ahead of time. Found it in the\r\nWorld War Two, with the sub service, and then they doubled it in spades\r\non the nuclear jobs. I guess they figure all of us for--what do they\r\ncall it?--oral regressives--anybody who’ll get into this kind of spot\r\nat all. Anyhow, that’s one thing I never had to fight for. Johnny can\r\ntell you, even at the beginning, before we really had the farm going,\r\nwe used to get beef and turkey sent up, even when there was no shipping\r\nspace for lab supplies! Lord, how that used to gripe me!” He stopped a\r\nminute, to empty his wine glass. “Coffee?”\r\n\r\n“Let me do it,” Lee said.\r\n\r\n_Busy little bee, ain’t you just, baby?_\r\n\r\n“Of course that was before we had the Messenger,” Chris was going\r\nagain. “Every ounce counted, ten times over then.”\r\n\r\n“Yeah,” Johnny heard himself saying, his voice coming from somewhere\r\noutside his volition, but inside himself: “We had pretty good chow\r\non. The. _Colombo._ Too.” That was how it came out. But how was\r\nunimportant. From where? _Why?_\r\n\r\nHe tried to remember when he had last so much as completed a conscious\r\n_thought_ about that travesty--let alone said a word about it--Except\r\n_No_ or _Go to Hell_! Or like that. He tried to see Lee’s face without\r\nher noticing. Tried to find something else to say, while they sat\r\nwaiting. Tried to think of some way for them to be on the shuttle\r\ntomorrow when it took off again.\r\n\r\n_Eight_ days, he thought. Eight whole long\r\ntwenty-four-hours-to-the-each old-fashioned Earth-type days. _My God!_\r\n\r\nIt had been a mistake to come. But he’d known that. _Old\r\nJohnny-can’t-turn-down-a-dare_, he thought, with small amusement.\r\n\r\nThat wasn’t quite right, either. It took _three_ dares: Chris; then\r\nLisa; then that damfool McLafferty with his idiot committees. Good ole\r\nSolidarity Wendt, all-out for ole buddy Chris. Yeah.\r\n\r\nThere was a little wine still in the bottle. He picked it up. “Lee?”\r\n\r\n“No thanks,” she said. “I’m on coffee now.”\r\n\r\n“Chris?”\r\n\r\n“Just a drop--no, never mind,” Chris said. “I’ve got some brandy\r\nsomeplace around--” But he made no move to get it. “I’ve got to get\r\nsome work done tonight yet. Always busy as hell around here when the\r\nMessenger’s up,” he added, to Lee.\r\n\r\n“How long does she stay in orbit?” Johnny asked, hoping it sounded idle.\r\n\r\n“Two days. Starts back Friday morning, but for our purposes, it’s\r\nThursday night. Anything out of here has to get off the ground by\r\nten tomorrow at the latest, to make orbit. Then she’s back by next\r\nWednesday. One thing, at least, you don’t have to worry about late\r\ntrains when they run on orbit!”\r\n\r\n_And when did I hear that joke the first time?_ Johnny thought, while\r\nLisa gave her nicest duty-laugh. _This party’s sure getting dead_, he\r\nthought. _And guess who killed it? Hell!_\r\n\r\n_Eight days. Okay._\r\n\r\n_Eight days?_\r\n\r\nHe finished the wine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“By the way,” Chris said, leaning back, “I’ve been catching up on that\r\nESP stuff since I saw you that time, Lee. You know, I used to fool\r\naround with it quite a bit back in school--the Rhine cards and all\r\nthat. But I lost touch.”\r\n\r\n“Decided you couldn’t push rockets with wishes?” Johnny bit in.\r\n\r\n“That’s about it,” said Chris equably. “Now I think maybe I should have\r\nstood with it. I’m sure as hell not pushing ’em any _other_ way.”\r\n\r\n“If spaceships were wishes,” Johnny said, and stood up. “It’s in there,\r\nisn’t it?” He pointed to the bedroom door.\r\n\r\n“Huh?” Chris double-took. “Oh, yeah, right through the bedroom.”\r\n\r\n“Excuse me.” He went out and left the other two in brief uncomfortable\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n“You know,” Chris said after a moment. “Telepathy would be damn useful\r\nsometimes, when you think of it.”\r\n\r\n“It’s okay, Chris.” Lee smiled, with obvious effort, and stood up. No\r\nmatter where she sat or what she did, her eyes kept turning back to the\r\nstark lithographic contrasts of the weird lunar landscape on the other\r\nside of the curved wall. “It’s--”\r\n\r\n... _a lot better than I was afraid of_.... Well, you didn’t say a\r\nthing like that: not even to a beaming-father-type like Chris. _He’s\r\nnot married_, she realized suddenly. That was too bad; he was a man who\r\nought to have children. _Children!_\r\n\r\nThe landscape blurred, and she blinked hard and fast.\r\n\r\n“... matter of fact,” he was saying, “Your man Potter seems to be\r\ngetting a lot of respect. Maybe we _will_ push ships with PK someday,\r\nif he’s right. Telepathy would be a lot more help just now, though--I’d\r\ngive a pretty to know what they’re up to at Red Dome, and Intelligence\r\ndoesn’t come up with much. His idea on telepathy is that it amounts to\r\na semantic translation of a total set of somatic conditions, right?”\r\n\r\n“That’s how I get it.” Outside, a shimmering blue-tailed beetle skimmed\r\nin a long parabola through the sky. Somebody’s shuttle-ship. _That’s\r\nhow we looked, coming in!_ “Doesn’t sound too likely, though--I mean,\r\nhow many people would get the right message ever, if it depended first\r\non one of them being able to--well, _project_ his own nerve and muscle\r\nsets to another, and then the other one having the right frame of\r\nreference, semantically, to ‘read’ the somatic set? Like, it won’t do\r\nus any good when we meet up with Jovians or the bug-eyed types from\r\nArcturus Three, will it?” _Keep it light_, that’s all. _Just keep it\r\nlight._\r\n\r\n“Oh, I’m willing to let the Arcturians wait,” he laughed. “I just want\r\nto know what the boys in Red Dome are dreaming up. Now if you just fill\r\nme in on how to make your muscles feel like my muscles--come to think\r\nof it, that’s up Kutler’s alley, isn’t it? Wonder if he’s up on this at\r\nall?”\r\n\r\n“Talking dirty again?” Johnny stood in the bedroom doorway looking from\r\nher to Chris to her. “Kindly keep y’all’s muscles in different parts\r\nof the room,” he said, with a grin that was not a grin at all. “Or,”\r\nhe went on, facing Chris, still with the smile that made the words an\r\nofficial joke, “you will start feeling _my_ muscles.”\r\n\r\n_Oh, Lord! Stop it, Johnny!_ please _stop_!\r\n\r\n“How in hell did you two get around to the Phys Ed department?” he went\r\non. “I thought I left you up on thought-steam rocket ships?”\r\n\r\n“Too rarefied,” Chris said. “They forgot to think us up some\r\natmosphere.”\r\n\r\n“Oh? Oh, yes, when did Young Doctor Kutler join the party?”\r\n\r\n“Well, he hasn’t yet. Matter of fact, I thought he’d be up here by now.\r\nHe took over as official greeter for me with the new people who came up\r\nwith you.”\r\n\r\n“You mean,” Johnny said slowly, “Kutler is up here too?”\r\n\r\n“Sure. Didn’t you know? Lee, _you_ knew...?”\r\n\r\n_Yes. Yes, I did._ “Hmmm?” She made a great thing out of tearing\r\nherself from the view. “Oh, is he here _now_? I knew he _had_ been up,\r\nbut--?”\r\n\r\nChris swallowed it. Not Johnny. Damn him, damn his eyes! He had no\r\nright to know so much about her and so stupid-silly little about _him_.\r\n\r\n“Sure, he’s on the payroll now. First time I ever did anything the\r\nSecurity boys loved me for. We’ve had this problem of sending people on\r\nleave one month out of every four. Plays hell with our schedules and\r\npersonnel problem, which didn’t bother them downstairs--but when they\r\nstarted tightening up on Security, they got _damn_ bothered about all\r\nthese classified project people being Earthside on their own so much.\r\nBut if they stay up here, without that relief, they don’t last a year,\r\nmost of ’em. Every psychogenic trouble in the books--plus some Phil can\r\nwrite his own book about it when he’s done. They--there he is. Come in.\r\nHi--we were talking about you.”\r\n\r\nPhil came in, smiled quietly, nodded to Lisa, and crossed to where\r\nJohnny stood, hand held out.\r\n\r\n“It’s good to see you again,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Is it?”\r\n\r\nPhil dropped the hand Johnny had ignored.\r\n\r\nShe knew exactly what would happen next, and could not even start to\r\nthink how to avoid it. She was appalled, but in a way almost relieved,\r\nto find she was not even going to _try_.\r\n\r\nThe two men stood two feet apart, face to face, for a hovering moment.\r\nThen Phil turned, with a faint shrug. “How do you pick these guys you\r\nhire, Chris? I swear, when you talk to a bunch of them, you’d think\r\nthey were all manufactured in the same--”\r\n\r\n“_I_ hire?” Christensen started. “Hell of a lot _I_ have to do with....”\r\n\r\n“I asked you something, Doc,” Johnny said at the same time, and reached\r\nout and put his hand on Kutler’s shoulder, turning him back. “Are you\r\nso damn sure it’s so good to see me?”\r\n\r\nKutler shook his shoulder sharply; Johnny’s grip tightened.\r\n\r\nLisa stood watching.\r\n\r\n“For krissake, Wendt!” Chris stepped forward. “What did _he_ do?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” Johnny said through almost clenched teeth. “Not a goddam\r\nthing!” He didn’t look at Chris; just at Phil. He dropped his hand.\r\nNeither one moved.\r\n\r\n“So _you’re_ the bright boy who’s been making plans?” Johnny laughed, a\r\nshort ugly bark. “I should of known. Okay, boy, here I am. Still in my\r\nhead, more or less. You proved your point. Lightning didn’t strike. I\r\nmade the trip, and so what? What’s next on your list of magic tricks?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Christ, Wendt, forget it, will you?” Kutler said. “I didn’t ask\r\nto get you here. I only work here.” He turned to Chris. “I’ll see you\r\nlater, I guess?” He turned to Lee. “I’m sorry.”\r\n\r\nThat was the cue, of course. Johnny took two steps forward and his arm\r\ndrew back. “Leave. Her. Out. Of. It,” he said. “You. Son. Of. A. Bitch.”\r\n\r\nFor one quick instant, the script almost went through to the end.\r\nSomething exploded in Phil Kutler’s eyes that Lisa had known must be\r\nin the man--because he _was_ a man--but had never seen or heard in any\r\nway. Then the doctor reached out again and drew back the male response.\r\n\r\n“Okay,” he told Johnny mildly. “Have it _your_ way.” He turned and left.\r\n\r\nThe silence he left was like the death of sound after a thunderclap.\r\nJohnny stood tense, his arm still half-set for a blow, until the door\r\nclosed. Then he dropped into the nearest chair, went loose all over,\r\nand looked down at the floor.\r\n\r\n“I guess I figured things a little wrong, Chris,” he said tiredly. “I\r\nshouldn’t have come. I’m sorry as all hell.” After a moment he looked\r\nup at Lisa, and then away. He said nothing to her. Dimly she knew\r\nthat--for the first time?--maybe not?--she had had nothing to offer him.\r\n\r\n_Damn it, oh damn, damn, damn, oh damn it all!_\r\n\r\n“Maybe it would be better if we went back down this trip,” Johnny said,\r\nstill to the floor.\r\n\r\n“I’ll see if I can work it,” Chris said. Something in his voice made\r\nher look closer. It was incredible, but it was true: Chris wasn’t\r\nangry; not even disappointed, specially; he just knew it was no good.\r\nMaybe he also knew it hurt Johnny even more than it did him to know it;\r\nbut he no longer cared. It wouldn’t work: that finished it. He went to\r\nthe cabinet, set a full bottle of Earthside brandy on the table, and\r\ntwo glasses.\r\n\r\n“Why don’t you two take this along to your place?” he said, casually as\r\nthough nothing had ended, nothing had even begun. “I’ll see what I can\r\ndo about shifting some schedules. We might have to try and get you onto\r\na UN ship, okay?”\r\n\r\nJohnny nodded. “Thanks.” He stood up, started to pass the bottle up,\r\nand couldn’t do it. Lee followed. _Damn it_, she thought, _this time he\r\nwasn’t even drunk!_\r\n\r\nHe made up for it. He was drunk _and_ asleep when Chris phoned to the\r\nroom two hours later. “He’s sleeping,” Lee said softly.\r\n\r\n“Oh? Well, listen, we’ve got a problem here. I can get _one_ bunk.\r\n_Only_ one. UN ship’s full up, a bunch of VIP’s who won’t wait. And I\r\ncan’t squeeze out more than one here, this trip.”\r\n\r\nShe was silent. She looked at the square solid face in the screen, and\r\nwished ... well, what was there _to_ wish?\r\n\r\n“The only way I could do it, Lee, would be as Priority Emergency, and I\r\nthink that might make some--well, some unpleasant publicity.”\r\n\r\n“It’s all right, Chris,” she said clearly. “Suppose Johnny takes this\r\none, and I’ll go next week, the way we planned.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think that’s--a good idea?”\r\n\r\nShe smiled. Johnny was not going to think it was a good idea at all.\r\n“It looks like the only thing we _can_ do, doesn’t it?” Well, Johnny\r\ncould think what he liked. “I--frankly, I’d just as lief stay the week,\r\nif it won’t--Well, you’re the boss. Just, if you think that’s best,\r\nit’s perfectly all right with me.”\r\n\r\nShe waited breathlessly. “Sure,” he said. “I just didn’t think you’d\r\nwant--I thought you might be uncomfortable staying by yourself.”\r\n\r\n“No. I’ll tell Johnny when he wakes up,” she said.\r\n\r\n“You send him to me,” Chris said. “I’ll tell him.” She did not\r\ncontradict.\r\n\r\nAfter she hung up, she went to the outside wall and pulled back the\r\ndrapes that Johnny had drawn. Light flooded the room. She closed the\r\ndrapes again, and stood outside them, nose to the window like a kid at\r\na candy store.\r\n\r\nInstead of being worried, or upset, or angry, or nervous, or anything\r\nshe _ought_ to be, she kept looking and wondering if people ever got\r\ntired of a scene like that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART SIX\r\n\r\n_August 25--September 2, 1977_\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dollars Dome--Thursday, August 25_\r\n\r\n“Yeah. Sure. If it’s all right with Lee, it’s okay.” _Sure, what the\r\nHell? Why shouldn’t I leave my girl behind? Give the other boys a\r\nchance._... That was idiocy. Or was it? You couldn’t say Chris had\r\nfailed to _notice_ Lee. _Well, who does? You want a babe nobody else\r\nwants, find yourself some old bag. Plenty of girls who’ll be overjoyed\r\nto marry the great Wendt._ Plenty of ’em. Sure. For all he knew, this\r\ntime might have torn it with Lee anyhow. He stood up. “I’ll go see if I\r\ncan round her up and see what she thinks, okay?”\r\n\r\n“Right. See you in half an hour? I’ve got to get the changes cleared\r\nthrough soon as possible.”\r\n\r\n“Right.” He went out of Admin and across the mall to the guest\r\nresidence. The place had changed since--well, sure it had, he was\r\nthinking four years back and more. He hadn’t really _seen_ it when he\r\ncame through on the way back from--\r\n\r\n_All right, leave it lay.... Forget it!_\r\n\r\nShe wasn’t in the room. He found her finally in the dining room,\r\ndrinking a glass of milk with a tableful of awed young scientists. If\r\nhe could laugh today, it would be funny--the way their eyes swiveled\r\nafter her when she got up to come to him. _Plus_ the double-take when\r\nthe whispered word went round the table about who it was she’d gone to.\r\n_The great Wendt!_\r\n\r\nWell, the great Wendt was getting sent home for being bad. And he\r\ncouldn’t have mama’s hand to hold, this trip.\r\n\r\n“Chris says he can swing one berth, but that’s all,” he said. “The way\r\nI see it, I’m a heel no matter what I do. You rather stay alone till\r\nnext trip, or what?”\r\n\r\n“Well--what do you think?”\r\n\r\n“I think--never mind, babe, you don’t _want_ to know that. I guess\r\nthere’s nothing to do but go along with it? Unless you think you’d be--”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. It’s that ole sou’then gennulman training coming out.\r\nYou know what I mean.”\r\n\r\n“_Here?_ Don’t be an idiot, darling. I’ll keep my chastity.”\r\n\r\nDamnedest part of it was: she would, too.\r\n\r\n“Okay, babe. I’ll go let him know.” But he stayed where he was. “Babe?”\r\n\r\n“Hmmm?”\r\n\r\n“Hell, I--I’m sorry, that’s all. I don’t know what the Hell...!”\r\n\r\n“It’s okay, Johnny. Let it ride, huh?”\r\n\r\n“Sure.”\r\n\r\nBut there was something missing. After he talked to Chris, he wandered\r\nout, thinking he’d find her and see if there was anything he could do,\r\nin the three hours he had, to help things. Then he knew what he really\r\nmeant by “help things,” and made sure he _didn’t_ find her.\r\n\r\n_She_ wouldn’t stop him. But it wasn’t what she wanted. Or what he had\r\nany right to ask.\r\n\r\nBe a good thing if she did find someone else, he thought. He swallowed\r\nthe fury in his throat, and found the bar.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRIP TO MOON FOR PROCESS SERVER?\r\n\r\n  DOME DIRECTOR SUBPOENAED\r\n\r\n    _McLafferty Demands Christensen\r\n    Testify at Special Hearing For\r\n    Space Security Next Week_\r\n\r\n  Mexcity, Aug. 25: Dr. Peter A. Christensen, Director of the\r\n  All-Americas Laboratory for The Investigation of Extra-Territorial\r\n  Phenomena, has been summoned to testify at a Special Hearing of\r\n  the Security Subcommittee of the Joint Congressional Space Affairs\r\n  Committee (SAC).\r\n\r\n  The Subcommittee convened in special session yesterday to study\r\n  evidence previously announced by Chairman Ramon E. McLafferty (I.,\r\n  E. Ch.) as “seriously questioning the efficacy of Space Research\r\n  Security.” The nature of the evidence has not yet been revealed.\r\n\r\n  Special Hearings on the matter, which Rep. McLafferty describes as\r\n  “most urgent,” will commence next week, in advance of the convening\r\n  of Congress. Dr. Christensen was called upon by the Committee today\r\n  to appear voluntarily for questioning in regard to Security measures\r\n  in the Moon Dome.\r\n\r\n  Queried on the procedure of the Subcommittee if the Moon Research\r\n  Director should fail to comply with the request for voluntary\r\n  appearance, Rep. McLafferty said that a subpoena definitely would be\r\n  issued.\r\n\r\n  “The Moon Dome is a territorial part of the Americas,” stated the\r\n  East Chilean Industrialist, who is a candidate for Senator from\r\n  Chile this fall. “If it is necessary to send a subpoena there,” he\r\n  told a press conference this morning, “we will do so.” He added that\r\n  he did not believe Dr. Christensen would fail to comply with the\r\n  Subcommittee’s request.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dollars Dome--Sunday, August 28_\r\n\r\nThe Biochem labs occupied a complete “building”--a structural unit\r\nshaped like a pie-slice with the first forkful already gone--a pumpkin\r\npie, possibly, or any fallen custard filling that would provide\r\nfor greater height at the outside than in the center. Eight such\r\nbuildings extended from the central Mall to the crater walls, rising by\r\nstepped-back stories till the top two levels in each were single rows\r\nof rooms facing the transparent dome wall above the crater. These were,\r\nfor the most part, living quarters, but in Bio even the top stories\r\nwere taken over for lab space by now.\r\n\r\nStill, there was not room enough in the one building. The “Mars-bugs,”\r\nwhich had occupied perhaps one cubic meter in their sample boxes on\r\nthe _Colombo_ twenty months earlier had been so carefully, prudently,\r\nfrequently, and multi-experimentally proliferated in the meantime\r\nthat a department which had once shared the single building with\r\ntwo other sections had now--and recently, nearly half of the growth\r\nhaving occurred in the past three months--overflowed into corners and\r\ncorridors all through the Dome.\r\n\r\nThere was a batch of cultures in Metallurgy being studied for\r\n“evolution-mutation” response to various mineral environments. With the\r\nassays and testing of (non-self-reproducing) Mars samples long finished\r\nin that department, and its original function in connection with rocket\r\nconstruction and propulsion become an economic dodo, the once-proudly\r\n_in_organic chemists turned eagerly to working with bugs.\r\n\r\nThe hydroponics farm had suffered no such financial blight as had\r\nMetals and Fuels and other non-maintenance projects; but efficiency\r\nin the building known as the Farm had so minimized space requirements\r\nduring eleven years of steadily increased personnel _and_ improved\r\nliving standards, that one whole tank room was available--and thus put\r\nto use--for “farming” experiments with bugs.\r\n\r\nA section of Electronics was currently being cleared and remodeled for\r\nthe cybernetic approach to a theoretical understanding of “controlled\r\nevolution” by construction of analog computers which might “act out”\r\nthe mathematics that had to date eluded all other efforts at analytical\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the bugs had already, in one sense, overflowed the\r\nDome itself. One farm-tank full had been “planted” in an open pavilion\r\noutside the walls, roofed against meteors, but incompletely enclosed:\r\n“The Shack” was the simplest way to conduct Moon-environment tests.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLisa followed Thad Bourgnese down ramp after ramp in the Bio building,\r\nlistening with half an ear as she was trailed through the upper\r\nlevels where the Earth-normal atmosphere work was done, down to\r\nthe glassed-off pressurized chambers near the crater floor where\r\nexperiments were conducted by space-suited scientists in Mars-normal,\r\nor at least a half-dozen variant approximations of Mars-normal,\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nThis was the only building she had not previously toured at least\r\nsuperficially; and Thad was seeing to it that her tour here was _not_\r\nsuperficial at all. But by this time she was chronically half a day\r\nbehind herself, still absorbing mentally what she had seen in the\r\nmorning, while she tried to retain what was shown her in the afternoon\r\nlong enough to digest it that evening.\r\n\r\nShe hadn’t realized; she hadn’t even _begun_ to realize before\r\nshe came: she had known everything there was to know about Johnny\r\nWendt--except what mattered.\r\n\r\nShe knew the public hero, the lover, and the tortured man. From very\r\nfar and very near, especially from near--from inside-out almost--she\r\nknew him better than, perhaps, she knew herself: certainly better than\r\n_he_ knew himself. But now, in his absence, she was learning for the\r\nfirst time in concrete specific terms just _who_ Johnny was--what he\r\nhad done--and _why_ so many people _gave_ a damn.\r\n\r\nNine-tenths of the research inside the Dome was directly connected\r\nwith what Johnny had brought back from Mars. Half of the total stemmed\r\ndirectly from investigations initiated by either Wendt or Laughlin on\r\nMars, or by Johnny on the trip home.\r\n\r\nThe popular tag, _astronauts_, was misleadingly limited, and Johnny\r\nhad never done or said anything to correct the misconception for Lee.\r\nThe fact was, he and Doug had not been sent just to pilot a ship,\r\ncollect specimens, and carry them safely home. That job could have been\r\naccomplished with robots; the justification for risking human life was\r\nthe requirement of trained human judgment. The two men had not just\r\npicked samples: they had decided _what_ to pick; had run the first\r\ntests and experiments on the spot; initiated whole lines of research;\r\nand judged on the basis of their findings what was worth carrying home\r\nand what was not.\r\n\r\nThey had worked hard for a year and more on Mars; and harder, perhaps,\r\ntraining for ten long years before. Between them, they had contained\r\na practicing knowledge of the whole spectrum of analytical and\r\ninvestigative sciences. Doug was the “biologist”--which, in that team,\r\nmeant doctor, farmer, organic chemist, cook, as well as the branches of\r\nthe life sciences; Johnny was “physicist,” which meant, in particular,\r\nthe whole range of cybernetics, from its application to neurology and\r\nlinguistics, to its most abstruse “big-brain” computing techniques.\r\nAs such, he was pilot and navigator, engineering crew, construction\r\nand repair man, inorganic chemist, civil, mechanical, and electrical\r\nengineer, nuclear physicist, and mathematician.\r\n\r\nIt had taken ten years of Academy and post-grad work, and then special\r\ntraining on the Moon, to prepare these two, and a score of others for\r\nthe complex job. In the end, Johnny and Doug had seemed the best team\r\nfor the trip.\r\n\r\nLisa had known all this, but known it as one knows, for instance,\r\nthat the diameter of Earth is 7928 miles; now she was learning it\r\nfirst-hand, as one knows the diameter of a plum is small enough to be\r\nheld inside one’s hand.\r\n\r\nAnd it was awkward, always, because everyone--bar Chris and Phil--took\r\nit for granted that she knew already.\r\n\r\nNaturally, Johnny would have told her everything; naturally, she’d have\r\nseen the slides and films, read the records, heard the stories over and\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nBut--naturally--she knew nothing, except what she had read in public\r\nprint, heard from Phil Kutler, or pieced together from Johnny’s\r\ninfrequent, oblique, and most often uncompleted references. If he even\r\nowned any slides or pictures, Lisa did not know about it; she finally\r\nhad to ask to see the stereos of the Martian “city”--the crumbling\r\nruins of whatever civilization had once existed there. Then, when they\r\nfound out that she really never _had_ seen anything, they brought\r\nthe whole works out for her: Marscapes and space shots and all the\r\n“Mars-bug” micro-shots that were not _too_ classified to show.\r\n\r\nAnd all the time, wherever she went, whatever she did, right outside\r\nand visible every time you crossed the mall, was the Beyond, the\r\nstill-unborn world of the Moon, and Space itself, the stuff of dreams\r\nthat ruled the whole life of a man like Peter Christensen--that _had_\r\nruled, guided, channelled Johnny’s life, until--\r\n\r\nTill what? Till he went out too far? Till he woke up? Until the big\r\ndream turned to a steady nightmare for some reason no one, Phil or\r\nChris, Johnny, or she herself, quite knew.\r\n\r\nThe strange thing was, the more she learned, the more she understood,\r\nabout the John Wendt she had never met, the harder it was to think of\r\ngoing home to the sad travesty of the whole man who waited for her back\r\non Earth.\r\n\r\nWell, not yet quite on Earth: it was now Sunday afternoon, and he would\r\nbe en route along the Belt from Perigee--or even spiraling downward in\r\nthe Earth bird by now. Since Thursday night, he would have been in the\r\nsame state of drugged calm in which they had both awakened just enough\r\nto take nourishment and eliminate wastes, still half-unaware, all the\r\nway up.\r\n\r\n“Well, that’s about it....”\r\n\r\nLisa pulled herself out of her private world of worry and wonderment,\r\nand followed Thad back up the ramps.\r\n\r\n“About the only thing you haven’t seen yet is the Shack,” he was saying.\r\n\r\n“Shack?”\r\n\r\n“Outside,” he explained. “We figured the easiest way to study these\r\nbabies at Moon conditions was right out there on the Moon. You’ve\r\nprobably seen the Shack from your window. You’re in North Hall, aren’t\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\n“Yesss ... oh, of course. I thought--” She giggled, realizing for the\r\nfirst time how absurd the immediate assumption had been. “I thought it\r\nwas some kind of _guard_ house.”\r\n\r\nThad laughed and pushed the lounge room door open for her, leaned past\r\nto hold it as she went through. He nodded to two men deep in discussion\r\nnear the door, waved to a group across the room. It was cheerful and\r\nlate-afternoon-feeling inside. A handsome red-haired girl detached\r\nherself from a knot of white-coated technicians at the tea table and\r\napproached them.\r\n\r\n“Hi, Ree.” His voice held a special warmth that made Lisa look again,\r\nmore closely, at the girl. It was astonishing, really, how many of\r\nthese girl scientists were lovely women as well....\r\n\r\n_Well! How quaint! Shades of great-granddad!_ ... but it was true, all\r\nthe same, she thought stubbornly. You just _didn’t_ see this particular\r\nkind of--well, loved-loveliness--in most busy-brain career types on\r\nEarth. But here, even the plain ones seemed to have that sort of\r\n_glow_....\r\n\r\n_So?_ There were at least as many men as women here, she reminded\r\nherself--and no fluffy chicks to grab off the men from the brainy\r\ntypes. So why shouldn’t they look loved-and-lovely? They _were_, that’s\r\nall. As to wit, Thad’s voice just now....\r\n\r\n_Oh, Johnny! Johnny, come back! Wherever you are, all the rest of you,\r\ndarling--come back!_\r\n\r\nThe three of them sat together, drinking hot tea and talking: the\r\ndance, and biology, McLafferty and psychosomatic cures, the current\r\ntopics of gossip and news in the Dome--all but one, Lisa thought. None\r\nof them mentioned John Wendt.\r\n\r\n_He’s down by now, I guess._...\r\n\r\n“What time does the rocket get down to Earth usually?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Oh, six, seven, eight, maybe nine--depends on the Belt and ionosphere\r\nconditions, mostly.”\r\n\r\nShe nodded, sipped tea. It was nearly six now; he’d be on Relay, or on\r\nthe way down. What was he thinking? What had he been thinking...?\r\n\r\nNothing, of course. He’d been asleep all this time. Four days in her\r\nlife that had simply _not-been_ for him: it was a strange thought, and\r\nan unpleasant one.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShe was up in her room, just done changing for dinner, when Chris\r\nphoned, to tell her he’d received clearance on the Earth landing. “I\r\njust wanted to let you know,” he said a bit awkwardly. “Everything’s\r\nfine....”\r\n\r\n“Johnny--?” She took a firm grip on the words this time: “Johnny was\r\nall right? He wasn’t upset, or--anything?”\r\n\r\n“He’s fine. Tell you the truth, Lee, I asked for a special call on it.\r\nHe came out of it fine. Calm. Sent word he’d meet you at Baja next\r\nweek.”\r\n\r\n“Oh thank _God_!”\r\n\r\nShe had not meant that to be said aloud; she was not even _certain_\r\nthat she had. But the words stayed in her brain like a refrain for\r\nhours afterward: _thank God, oh, thank God!_\r\n\r\n“... told them I’d ask you, and see what you....”\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry, Chris. I was wandering. I missed something.”\r\n\r\n“The World Dome call.”\r\n\r\n“Which World Dome call?”\r\n\r\n“You _were_ wandering, gal. I was telling you, I had a call from the\r\nUN Dome right after the one from Relay. They heard you were staying on\r\nthis week, and wanted to know if there was any chance of getting you to\r\ngive an evening performance before you go?”\r\n\r\n“Performance? Here? On the _Moon_?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I _said_ I didn’t know--Why not? I should think this place would\r\nbe a dancer’s dream?”\r\n\r\nHe was dead right, of course. And she was shocked that in five days\r\nhere she’d never even _thought_ of the things you could do dancing at\r\none-sixth gravity!\r\n\r\n“I’d _love_ to, Chris, but--listen, I’ll try some stuff tonight and see\r\nhow it goes, okay? Can you let them know tomorrow morning?”\r\n\r\n“Sure. It would be all rush-rush, anyhow. Not much difference tonight\r\nor tomorrow. You had dinner yet?”\r\n\r\n“I was just going. I told Thad I’d eat with him and that lovely\r\ngirl--Rita?”\r\n\r\n“Rita Donovan?”\r\n\r\n“That’s right. But if I’m going to practice, I think I’ll eat later.\r\nAre you going down now?”\r\n\r\n“I suppose so. Why?”\r\n\r\n“Well, would you explain to Thad? Or what’s his room? I’ll call--”\r\n\r\n“I’ll let him know. Now can _I_ ask a favor?”\r\n\r\n“Any time, Chris.” He was such a _nice_ man....\r\n\r\n“Frankly, I feel kind of foolish,” he said, with his slow smile, “but\r\nKutler’s been up here sounding off about your dancing, and tell you the\r\ntruth, I don’t usually take much time for that kind of thing on tri-di.\r\nI--”\r\n\r\nShe let out a peal of delighted laughter. “_Doctor_ Christensen, are\r\nyou asking for a stage-door pass to watch rehearsal?”\r\n\r\n“I guess that’s the size of it.” He actually looked sheepish...!\r\n\r\n“Okay, but on one condition--”\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“Where’s the stage?”\r\n\r\nHe started to answer, and she interrupted. “I didn’t mean _the_ stage.\r\nI meant a place for practice. All I need is floor and something to play\r\ntapes on. Oh--can I get some stuff from the library now?”\r\n\r\n“All the time,” he said. “Like the dining room. Library has to stay\r\nopen, around here. Everyone’s on such whacky schedules.”\r\n\r\n“Well, good, I’ll change and go see what they’ve got. Suppose--how\r\nabout meeting me there? Then you can show me where to set up shop?”\r\n\r\n“Great. Twenty minutes. I’ll see Thad on the way.”\r\n\r\n“You’re a doll.” She switched off, humming the tune that had started\r\nto run through her head as soon as she thought at all seriously about\r\ndancing here. But _how_ could she not have thought of it once all this\r\ntime?\r\n\r\nShe shook her head, smiling, still humming, and changed to dance\r\nleotards, added a full skirt, and slipped on soft dance shoes.\r\n\r\nBefore she left the room, she stood for a long moment looking through\r\nthe dome wall at the brilliant mid-day moonscape outside.\r\n\r\n_If I ask to see the Shack, they’ll let me go out_, she thought; and\r\nthought, afterwards, it was silly to _want_ to so much. But she would\r\nask.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mexcity--Monday, August 29, 9:30_ A.M. _(C.S.T.)_\r\n\r\nThe General refolded his morning paper, and set it neatly in its\r\naccustomed upper left hand corner of his desk. He was pleased. By now\r\nthe gossip columnists would be in full cry; the afternoon papers would\r\nbe worth seeing.\r\n\r\nFrom his briefcase, he took a flat envelope, and excerpted three\r\nmicrofilms. He threw the first one on the desk reader, and glanced\r\nthrough it again: Chris was too damn _involved_ with Wendt, he thought\r\nworriedly. The message was somehow, almost intangibly, fuzzy; not\r\nChris’ usual clear-stated summary, anyhow. And somehow the man had\r\ncompletely missed seeing the obvious newspaper advantages.\r\n\r\nPrentiss had just about bust a gut getting the press release ready when\r\nword came from Relay--and Chris hadn’t even thought to call him during\r\nthe week on it, so they could get set ahead.\r\n\r\nNobody (but _no_body, the General thought chuckling reminiscently) was\r\ngoing to believe that Johnny Wendt had gone up to the Moon, in the\r\ncompany of a beautiful dancer, both under strictest security to the\r\npoint of full-trip sedation, and come back, the same way, the same\r\n_Messenger_ orbit, leaving the gal behind, for purely _personal_,\r\nnon-significant reasons.\r\n\r\nHe found it hard to believe himself. The more he thought about it,\r\nthe more the overtones--or undertones?--of the courier-message from\r\nChristensen bothered him.\r\n\r\n_Hell_, he decided: _It’s good copy. That’s all._\r\n\r\nAnd what _could_ Chris be pulling?\r\n\r\nIt didn’t make sense enough to worry over.\r\n\r\nSo he stopped worrying.\r\n\r\nThe next film he had also seen at home the night before, but he\r\nstudied it carefully again. It was long: five single-spaced typed\r\npages, compactly written; and it contained the life history of\r\nRamon E. McLafferty, Congressman from East Chile, white hope of the\r\nIndustrialist Party, Chairman of the Space Security Subcommittee of the\r\nJoint House-Senate Space Affairs Committee--former ranch hand, bookie,\r\nstock yard “insurance”-protection boss, newspaper owner, fighting union\r\nsmasher, contractor for nearly 20% of the work on construction of the\r\n_Messenger_, minority holder of Undersea Corp. stock, and probable next\r\njunior Chilean Senator.\r\n\r\nThe General spent some time rereading, and reading again, the story\r\nof Ray McLafferty’s rags-to-riches rise--plus an abstract of a\r\npsychoanalytic report, and some dirty-edges peripheral track-trailing.\r\nWhen he felt quite sure he had all the pertinent facts in his mind, he\r\ntook the film and placed it immediately in the special miniature safe\r\nat the back of his bottom desk drawer.\r\n\r\nThe third film was a standard form from M.I., stamped across the top\r\nwith block-lettered TOP SECRET’s. This one Harbridge had gotten on his\r\nway to work. It was, as it turned out, the most interesting document of\r\nthe three.\r\n\r\nIn one unsensationally worded paragraph, it stated conclusively that\r\ndefinite evidence had finally been obtained regarding the Palisades\r\nQuery. There had been a physical transferral of subjects (ref. PQ\r\n1579J-2z) on several occasions, first known being 9/12/76; most recent,\r\n3/14/77; two known dates in between, and three suspected. Transferral\r\nin small quantity, but sufficient for purpose of investigation by\r\ninstigators.\r\n\r\nWhich meant simply that on at least four occasions, small, but\r\nsignificant, samples of Mars-bugs _had_ been successfully turned over\r\nto agents of Red Dome, where said samples might now be assumed to\r\nhave flourished and multiplied, and to be under study at _least_ as\r\nintensive as that at Playfair.\r\n\r\nThe General pursed his lips thoughtfully. He removed the film, and held\r\na match to the edge, dropped it into a metal bowl set with precision at\r\nthe right front edge of the desk top, watched it dissolve into smoke\r\nand a small residue of chemical matter.\r\n\r\nHe repeated the procedure with Chris’s report, smiling as he thought\r\nabout Ray McLafferty:\r\n\r\n_Lordy, what he’d give to see that damn paper!_\r\n\r\nThe smile was because there was no possibility that any such\r\ninformation could get to the Congressman’s hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dollars Dome--Tuesday, August 30, 1977_\r\n\r\n“I hate to stop and eat, even,” she said. Her cheeks were pink, and\r\nher smile was one of pure sensual pleasure. You could see in the way\r\nshe walked that she was still feeling the wild pleasures of leaps and\r\npirouettes to soaring music, free from the weight of a lifetime on\r\nEarth. “You know, I just can’t figure out why I never even _thought_ of\r\nit till they asked!”\r\n\r\nPhil smiled, and manufactured a leer. “Come let me show you my couch,”\r\nhe said. “We’ll find _out_ why.”\r\n\r\n“Darling,” she said, “But I’m _hungry_.”\r\n\r\n“Wellll--okay,” he said. “_After_ dinner.”\r\n\r\nThey laughed at each other, and impulsively, she reached for his hand\r\nas they walked into the dining room. Damn if it wasn’t catching,\r\nhe thought with amusement, and yet with a sharpening edge of\r\nconcern--because it just didn’t _fit_. But when you looked at the\r\ntables in here, the groups of two, four, five, six, eating and talking\r\nand smiling....\r\n\r\nIt reminded him of something dim, in the background of memory....\r\n\r\nHe caught it: photographs, in his childhood, of Israeli and Russian\r\nco-ops. Propaganda shots, of happy smiling healthy “free workers.”\r\n\r\nBut the scene here was not posed. It was for real. And it went on all\r\nthe time, all the hell over the slaphappy Dome. _And_ it was getting\r\nmore pronounced. He noticed it more than he had at first, in spite of\r\ngetting used to it. _And_ he thought it had started to show up in the\r\nclinical picture too. Nothing conclusive yet, but--\r\n\r\n“Hey?” She’d said something he missed.\r\n\r\n“Just--I wish I was going to have time to _do_ that show.”\r\n\r\n“Well, why not? Chris said something about them calling again today. If\r\nyou gave the word now, I’ll bet they’d get it set for tomorrow night?”\r\n\r\n“_Tomorrow?_ Don’t be silly, dear. I’d need at _least_ four more--well,\r\nmaybe three days. But I’m just _starting_ to get an idea what I can do.\r\nPhil, it’s like--like starting all over, say to learn ballet, _after_\r\nyou’ve been an expert in, say, African dance. It’s _that_ different!”\r\n\r\n“Yeah? Well you could fool me, kid. I’m just ignorant enough to think\r\nyou looked damn good back there.”\r\n\r\nThey took their dinners to a table where Thad Bourgnese and the\r\nDonovan girl and a couple of others were already seated. Thad jumped up\r\nto move a chair for Lee next to his own. Phil pulled up his own chair\r\nalongside Rita, watching her.\r\n\r\nBy every damn bit of experience he had with anyone he’d ever known,\r\nthis particular girl ought to flip her lid this time. Instead, she\r\nturned and smiled and said, “She is just too beautiful to believe,\r\nisn’t she?”\r\n\r\n“Yeah.” Phil ate his soup, and kept his thoughts to himself. When Chris\r\njoined them a few minutes later, and took Lisa’s other side, engaging\r\nher in intense quiet-voiced conversation, he watched Thad from out of\r\nthe edge of his vision.\r\n\r\nBourgnese turned to Rita again. That was all. You’d have sworn no one\r\nanywhere around the table had felt the least ruffle of irritation at\r\nany point.\r\n\r\nPhil was beginning to believe they _hadn’t_; for the first time,\r\nhe started mentally reviewing, _seriously_, some of the startling\r\nimprovements he’d seen in his hypertension cases. _It figures_, he\r\nthought, reluctantly. _Damn if it don’t figure_....\r\n\r\n“Phil!”\r\n\r\n“Hmmm?” He looked past Rita and Thad to Lee’s rosy face.\r\n\r\n“Remember what we were saying before?”\r\n\r\n“Yeah?” _Which what? Which before?_\r\n\r\n“Well,” she said, brimming with laughter, “Chris wants to know if I’d\r\nbe willing to give up my berth this week, so he can take it!”\r\n\r\n“I got the official bit just now,” Chris told them all. “They want me\r\nto testify next Tuesday. But, Lee, we can switch someone else, if you\r\nthink--”\r\n\r\n“Oh, _no_. I mean, thanks, but--well, frankly, I was just telling Phil\r\nwhen we came in, I wished I could have some more time for practicing.\r\nNow I’ve got started, I’m just _flabbergasted_....”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLater, he got her alone long enough to make sure she had not spoken\r\nspur-of-the-moment, before she thought about Johnny.\r\n\r\nShe hadn’t.\r\n\r\n“Chris said I could radiowire him this evening, and if he wants, he’ll\r\nbe able to call me, tonight or tomorrow. So we’re not announcing\r\nanything about the performance yet. But he got a report that Johnny was\r\nfine when he landed, and--oh, dammit, Phil, one week won’t _kill_ him.\r\nOne _more_ week, I mean. And when do you think I’ll ever get a chance\r\nto do this stuff again?”\r\n\r\n“Honey--_I’m_ not saying No.”\r\n\r\n“I know.” She looked at him with such affection it almost hurt. “I’m\r\nnot arguing with you, either, dear--just with me. But you know--I’m\r\nbeginning to think maybe Johnny’s a lot tougher than we give him credit\r\nfor. _I_ think he’ll be okay.” She stepped away, turned back for a\r\nmoment. “Or maybe I want to find out if he is,” she added, and vanished\r\ndown the ramp to her practice room.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. Croix, U.S.A.A.--Friday, September 2, 1977_\r\n\r\nThe bar was cool and dim in the daytime, a good place to sit and look,\r\nwithout the added haze and heat and too-bright light, into the anyhow\r\ndoubtful mirror of your mind. But as dusk dropped on the island, the\r\nbar conversely brightened. With the evening’s coolness, it grew warmer\r\ninside. At midnight, it had become a gaudy splotch of brilliance aburst\r\nwith noise, fragrance and stench, sweat and promises.\r\n\r\nLight and color, odors and entreating bodies, these could be shut\r\nout, he had learned quickly, simply by keeping his eyes on his glass,\r\nand his glass full enough. But the noises--shrieking and murmuring,\r\nlaughter and shouts, the sound of glasses, of cards and rolling dice\r\nand clicking wheels, of shuffling feet, pounding heels, of silver coins\r\nand golden rum in swift exchange,--the bloodbeating rhythm of the\r\ncalypso band in back of the thousand sounds of passion and delight,\r\ndespair, forgetfulness, lust and seduction in the tropic night--these\r\ncould not be shut out, nor would he do so if he could. They built a\r\nbarrier over the darkness that shrouded the mirror of his soul.\r\n\r\nJohnny sat where he had been since noon, in the carved wooden booth,\r\nand the girl’s voice for some reason emerged by itself, separately,\r\nfrom the sound of the room, drawing him back from the dazed withdrawal\r\nwith which he had countered the bar’s evening dawn.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her apprehensively: lovely kid. He shook his head: “No\r\nthanks, doll. Thanks, but no thanks. Siddown. Have a drink.”\r\n\r\nShe sat.\r\n\r\nShe was young, very young. Her shoulders were bare, and the white\r\nruffles of her blouse on breast and arms gave her an oddly _pure_ look\r\nin the cacophony of color in the midnight-bar. When she sat, the\r\ncerise skirt and black lace ruffle of her petticoat were hidden; all he\r\ncould see was the blouse and bare skin above. Light spilled on golden\r\nskin; the crimson of her lips was all the impact of color she made; all\r\nthe rest was black (hair and eyes), and white (blouse, teeth, eyes),\r\nand glowing tan-gold. She might have been anything from a grown-up\r\ntwelve to well-preserved twenty-two--well-preserved, that is, for an\r\nisland girl of her trade. Johnny guessed seventeen.\r\n\r\nWhile she drank rum-and-coke, and he sipped a fresh bourbon, he\r\ngave the whole idea some serious thought. A lovely girl, certainly.\r\nClean-looking, too. He could check with Jake. Jake would know; Jake was\r\nhis buddy. Jake said, don’t take any babes up without checkin’ first.\r\nHalf of ’em’s sick, and most of the rest is thieves. Jest check with me\r\nfirst. That’s what Jake said.\r\n\r\nJake was at the bar now. Johnny toyed with the thought of taking the\r\ngirl to the bar, and then maybe upstairs. The room upstairs was big and\r\ndim, cool, quiet now at midnight as it had been in the bar when he came\r\nin at noon. At noon the room was hot, and even through the blinds the\r\nwhiteness of high sun crept in.\r\n\r\nThe room was cool now: cool and quiet and all alone.\r\n\r\n_Lisa_....\r\n\r\n“What’s your name, doll?”\r\n\r\nShe told him, and it was hilariously funny, because it was Dolly, and\r\nhe’d called her _doll_ so she’d thought he knew all along, and the band\r\ncame and played _Dolly Dawn_. When they went to the bar, Jake nodded\r\nand said Dolly was fine, Dolly be good for him. So he gave Dolly five\r\ndollars, for being a good girl, and shook hands with Jake, and went up\r\nalone to the dim cool aloneness where nobody knew or cared anything\r\nanyhow he could sleep deep and no dreams.\r\n\r\nBut he remembered before he was all the way asleep that it was\r\nFriday--_had_ been Friday--and tomorrow--today--he would have to leave\r\n... back to where the world was and people who knew all about it ...\r\nabout everything.\r\n\r\nWhen he woke up, the newspaper was under the door for him: he’d told\r\nthem when he came: no papers, no tri-di, no nothin’, till Saturday.\r\nBring me a paper on Saturday. And here it was.\r\n\r\nThey were all right. Jake, all of them, they were okay.\r\n\r\nThe headline was right on page one.\r\n\r\n  _MOON LAB DIRECTOR WILL TESTIFY_\r\n\r\n  _Christensen To Appear At SAC Hearing Tuesday_\r\n\r\n  Mexcity, Sep. 2: Dr. Peter A. Christensen, Research Director of the\r\n  U.S.A.A. Moon Laboratory, is en route to Earth today, to testify\r\n  voluntarily for the McLafferty Committee, at a hearing next Tuesday,\r\n  Sep. 6.\r\n\r\n  The announcement of Dr. Christensen’s compliance with the request of\r\n  the S.A.C. Security Subcommittee Chairman, Rep. Ramon E. McLafferty\r\n  (I., E. Ch.) was made today by Brigadier General “Jed” Harbridge,\r\n  Decagon Science and Space chief. The Moon Lab program, although under\r\n  Congressional control primarily, is sponsored in part by the U.S.A.A.\r\n  Space Academy, and associated Decagon Space Research units.\r\n\r\n  There was no comment from Gen. Harbridge on the “evidence” McLafferty\r\n  claims to have regarding Security leaks, and general laxity, at\r\n  the Moon Dome. The official Decagon statement said only that Dr.\r\n  Christensen boarded the Messenger satellite last night, and will\r\n  appear, of his own volition, at the Tuesday hearing.\r\n\r\n  Dr. Christensen’s decision followed an official request from the\r\n  Subcommittee radioed to the Moon Tuesday. Acknowledgement of the\r\n  message and compliance with the request was received Wednesday\r\n  by Rep. McLafferty, it was learned at his office here today. Dr.\r\n  Christensen will arrive on Earth Sunday, Sep. 4, at about 8 P.M.,\r\n  at St. Thom Spaceport. The rocket, previously announced to land at\r\n  Baja Spaceport, was rescheduled for St. Thom after receipt of Dr.\r\n  Christensen’s message to the Decagon.\r\n\r\nJohnny smiled wryly. Poor Chris--everything had looked so rosy to him\r\nfive years ago. They were really ganging up on the guy now. _Yeah--poor\r\nChris! Poor benighted bastard! Damn good thing_ ... but you couldn’t\r\nhelp feeling sorry for the man. He meant well; he was a Hell of a good\r\nguy.\r\n\r\n_Just stupid, that’s all!_\r\n\r\nJohnny shrugged, dropped the paper, picked it up and riffled through\r\nfor other news, feeling luxurious because he didn’t have to leave today\r\nafter all. The ship was coming to St. Thom. Twenty minutes away, was\r\nall. Plenty of time, if he left on the six o’clock jitney tomorrow.\r\n“About 8 P.M.” usually wound up to mean about midnight....\r\n\r\n  TROVI TO DANCE ON MOON\r\n\r\n_Well, well, we’re getting around, aren’t we?_\r\n\r\nIt was a good picture of her, one of the batch they had taken out at\r\nthe edge of the pool last September: Lee in Peter Pan costume, poised\r\non one toe, it seemed, right on the edge of the pool--about to take\r\noff, you’d swear it.\r\n\r\n  A new art-form will be born this Saturday night [it said\r\n  underneath] when Lisa Trovi, world-renowned tri-di dancer, gives a\r\n  precedent-making performance at the Moon’s World Dome. Miss Trovi has\r\n  been on the Moon, at the U.S.A.A. Dome, since August 24, practicing\r\n  for her appearance this Saturday.\r\n\r\n  “It’s a completely new kind of dance,” Miss Trovi says. “I’m just\r\n  beginning to realize what can be done in light gravity. It’s like\r\n  changing from swimming in treacle to swimming in water.”\r\n\r\n  The performance, scheduled for 8.30 P.M. (G.S.T.--3.30 P.M. C.S.T.)\r\n  will be broadcast live if conditions permit. Tri-di tapes will be\r\n  aired from New York at a later date.\r\n\r\n_Saturday_....\r\n\r\nBut _this_ was Saturday. She wasn’t on the wheel. She wasn’t coming.\r\n\r\nHe realized only slowly that he was not surprised.\r\n\r\n“Stands to reason,” he thought. He showered and went down for breakfast\r\nof ham and eggs, pineapple juice, and good native rum at the bar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART SEVEN\r\n\r\n_September 5-18, 1977_\r\n\r\n\r\n_Acapulco--Monday evening, September 5._ “Still no dice?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing. God knows where the damfool is.” Chris came back from the\r\ntelephone, sat down in the webbed chair, and stared without seeing at\r\nan expanse of mountain, sun, water, and forest that would have demanded\r\nthe full attention of any man who did not live in daily view of heaven\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n“How bad _was_ it?” Harbridge asked.\r\n\r\n“Not too. He had sense enough to suggest going back himself, before it\r\ngot worse. I just wish to hell _I_ hadn’t been such a fool. I should\r\nhave known--I’ll tell you, the one I feel sorry for is the girl. Lisa.\r\nHe doesn’t know what he’s--Hell, sure he does!” _I keep forgetting_, he\r\nthought, ashamed. _Johnny’s entitled to anything he can get!_\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what’s going to happen now,” he said thoughtfully. “If\r\nhe’s not home, he might not have gotten her wire either. Hell to pay if\r\nhe finds out from the papers, or--Well, let’s hope he took off on a bat\r\nafter he _did_ get the message. But I hope she’s heard from him.”\r\n\r\nHarbridge was smiling with a sort of tolerant amusement. “Must be quite\r\na girl,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Go to Hell,” said Chris amiably. Both men laughed, and turned their\r\nattention to the less entertaining but more urgent business of the next\r\nday’s testimony.\r\n\r\nChris was astonished, as always, at a glimpse into the workings of a\r\nHarbridge operation. Jed had a list of the questions that he would\r\nbe asked. Jed also knew that McLafferty planned on parlaying the\r\nweek’s hearings into a trip to the Moon for himself. And he knew which\r\nreporters would cover the day with what biasses.\r\n\r\n“Reporters?” Chris was surprised. “Isn’t it on the air?”\r\n\r\n“Nope.” Jed’s mouth wrinkled briefly in half-smile. “The Honorable\r\nCongressman from East Chile says that he will not further endanger\r\nthe Security of the Americas by utilizing a hearing chamber in which\r\nmatters of utmost secrecy must be discussed as an open-air forum for\r\npersonal publicity. I quote,” he added, “from a rather extensive\r\narticle in the current _Time_.”\r\n\r\n“Well, well. Whaddya know? This boy is not stupid.”\r\n\r\n“Not even a little. Bear it in mind. Now; suppose we run through the\r\nquestions. Take the stand, Doctor.”\r\n\r\nThey went down the list. Occasionally, Jed would stop listening to make\r\na suggestion. Once he proposed a complete change of treatment. Mostly,\r\nhe nodded with satisfaction. “You’re really doing a job up there,\r\nChris,” he said when they finished. “Damn! It’s a pleasure to see\r\nsomeone once in a while who knows what goes on in his own bailiwick.”\r\nHe went to the bar. “What’ll you have? Scotch?” He poured, shaking\r\nhis head. “Sometimes, lately, it gets to seem as if everyone has his\r\neye on the ball so hard that you’d swear they don’t know what team\r\nthey’re playing for. Or what game it is. I don’t think I know more\r\nthan a dozen men in Mexcity who actually _do_ their jobs--that’s not\r\ntrue, either,” he stopped himself. “I know plenty of them--but they\r\nwork _for_ somebody. I meant men at the top. They’re so busy staying\r\nthere, somebody else has to ‘handle the details.’ Which means, do their\r\nwork for them, while they keep a weather-eye out on the lookout post.\r\nAnyhow,” he said briskly, “Ray McLafferty _knows_ what he’s doing. He’s\r\nno pushover, Chris.” He drank deeply, and walked over to where his\r\ncomrade-in-arms of twenty years’ battles sat.\r\n\r\n“Listen, Chris, what I’m saying is: watch out for this guy. He’s\r\ndangerous. Frankly, I think I might just have outsmarted myself this\r\ntime.”\r\n\r\n“That’s not how you sounded an hour ago.” Chris twirled his glass in\r\nhis hand. He did not look up. He knew Jed Harbridge pretty well. There\r\nwas more coming. “I thought we had it made?”\r\n\r\n“Here’s how I see it--as of right now. Ray’ll shoot the works on this\r\nthing. It’s a sure ticket into the Senate for him, if he plays it\r\nright. And he wants that seat _bad_. He’s aiming high. Frankly, I’m\r\nwith him. He’s smart and he works hard, and he’s got enough imagination\r\nto see what that ass in Americas House couldn’t see if you painted it\r\nout for him color by color. The day Ray gets in there--and I think\r\nhe’ll make it in twelve years, with any luck--we’ll _have_ a Space\r\nprogram and we won’t ever have to go through this kind of friggin\r\ncorruption to get what we need again.”\r\n\r\n“So? This is bad?” Chris put his glass down. He was beginning to\r\nunderstand, and he did not like the way it felt, somewhere around the\r\nmiddle of his belly.\r\n\r\n“Maybe. For you. Play it tough tomorrow, Chris. But when he comes to\r\nthe Dome--I’d play it soft if I were you. He wants a Space program--but\r\nhe wants it under his thumb. If you’re _too_ tough-- Well, he’ll\r\nprobably be head of SAC next year.”\r\n\r\n“I think I follow you, but I don’t know if I like the looks of the\r\nterrain. I take it you mean, _we’re_ going to win, but _I_ just might\r\nlose?”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t figure it that way, Chris-- Well, hell, you know that. This\r\nMcLafferty is new; I underestimated him at first ... I still think\r\nwe can handle him. I just don’t want to see you go in there without\r\nknowing everything.”\r\n\r\n“Yeah. I know.” Chris stood up. “Guess I’ll try Johnny once more,\r\nbefore I quit. Say--wasn’t there something about a subpoena for him?\r\nMaybe he’s ducking--”\r\n\r\n“Or maybe they’re keeping him tanked up and happy until the right day.\r\nThat’s one thing that does worry me, Chris. I hope you find the guy.”\r\n\r\n“Yeah. Well, there’s nothing that he can say, really. Christ, he didn’t\r\neven _see_ anything but the Dome. Had him kept under sedation the whole\r\nway.” He stopped in the doorway and turned back. “Here’s how I figure\r\nit, Jed. Like, I dragged Johnny up there because his name would help,\r\nand I guess after I met the girl, I knew she’d push too, right with us.\r\nShe wants him back on his feet. She’s a smart chick. She knows he can’t\r\nmake it from flat on his fanny; he needs a job to do. So: I get the\r\nguy up there. But I keep him knocked out all the way up. Why? Because\r\nI knew damn well he’d flip sooner or later, and I wanted to be on hand\r\nmyself when he did. Hell, I don’t mean I thought it out that way, in so\r\nmany words--but I can see it easily enough from here.\r\n\r\n“So Johnny’s my old buddy. Like you and me. Blood and sweat. And tears.\r\nThe whole routine. I didn’t give much of a damn what it did to _him_. I\r\ngot my newspaper story. If he’d cracked some other way from how he did,\r\nI might even have got to him and got him back to work. Snake pit. You\r\nknow? But I wasn’t thinking about _him_.\r\n\r\n“So if Johnny’s expendable, who gives a damn about _me_? Tell you the\r\ntruth, I’m getting old enough so I should maybe get back to Earth\r\nanyhow.” _And get married...?_\r\n\r\nThe unbidden thought stopped him cold. “Don’t rush anything,” Jed said\r\ndrily. “You’re not quite fired yet.” His mouth wrinkled again in the\r\nnot-quite smile. “Why don’t you give this dish a job up there, man,\r\ninstead of trailing her back here?”\r\n\r\n_That sonofabitch knows too_ damn _much!_\r\n\r\n“Okay,” he said. “Why don’t you talk the boys up on the hill into\r\nsetting up an institute of the dance upstairs? Maybe a whole Art\r\nAcademy? They might go that a lot quicker than a manned flight again.”\r\n\r\nWhen he got the operator again, he was surprised, and obscurely annoyed\r\nwith himself, to find he had to clear an adolescent lump from his\r\nthroat before he could give Johnny’s number.\r\n\r\nAnd there was no answer, still.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dollars Dome--Monday, September 5, 5_ P.M. (_C.S.T._)\r\n\r\nThe job itself was proving unexpectedly satisfying. Dr. Kutler brought\r\nhis last patient’s card up to date and sat back, swiveled his chair\r\naround and pulled aside the shutters that closed off the Dome wall\r\nduring consultations. For the victims of the variety of ailments that\r\nconstituted what they had started to call “loony-sickness,” even the\r\nsight of the alien land could interfere with the effort at therapy--no\r\nmatter how eager the patient was to be there, or how idealistically or\r\naesthetically pleased by the sight. When a man’s body is in rebellion\r\nagainst the disruptive effects of just-too-much-difference in his\r\nenvironment, it helps to minimize those differences--as much as\r\npossible--while trying to cure the bodily disorder.\r\n\r\nThe basic cause of the internal “dyscommunication” which caused hearts\r\nto pump overtime and reaching fingers to tremble and muscles to twitch\r\ncould not be shut out or turned off or even disguised. Low gravity was\r\nthe devil man had to fight--and conquer--on the Moon; and if he _could_\r\nhave turned it off for his patients, Phil would not have done so.\r\n\r\nThat was what quarterly leaves did. His job was to help them teach\r\ntheir bodies to live _with_ the difference.\r\n\r\nSome people could do it. To the doctor, that meant that most, if not\r\nall, could _learn_. Chris had stayed healthy for eleven years of\r\nalmost-solid Moon residence. Johnny had no psychosomatic troubles\r\nthrough two and a half years of low-grav and no-grav on the Mars\r\ntrip. There were at least a dozen others on the Dome staff who had\r\nalways regarded the required leaves as a nuisance, and had volunteered\r\neagerly for experimental work--more eagerly than usefully. The valuable\r\npatients were those who _got_ sick.\r\n\r\nThe valuable doctor, however, stayed healthy. It was too soon to tell,\r\nof course, about himself. Kutler knew his own weaknesses better than\r\nmost men do; but how predict strength or weakness against an unknown\r\nassailant?\r\n\r\nThat didn’t hold all the way either-- He knew he could predict Lisa’s\r\nimmunity. The woman was so incredibly _in control_ of her own body.\r\nHe remembered her at World Dome, soaring like a new--better?--kind of\r\nhuman ... a free creature....\r\n\r\nHe tried to dispose entirely of the idea gnawing him. It was so absurd\r\nhe should never, he thought, have allowed himself to think the idea\r\nthrough verbally. But he had; and it sure as hell _wasn’t_ absurd from\r\nhis own point of view. _She_ was a teacher who could be trusted to put\r\nher words into practice, to teach by doing.\r\n\r\n_Okay, so it’s a great notion. Get yourself somebody.... Plenty of\r\ndancers and physical therapists would love the chance._\r\n\r\nHe went to the intercom, dialed, and waited, No answer. He had almost\r\nswitched off when the screen suddenly lit.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Phil--Hi!” She was breathless. “I just got in, heard the thing\r\nbuzzing. What’s up? Have you heard...?”\r\n\r\nShe stopped as he shook his head. “No. I called to see if you had. Got\r\nin from _where_?”\r\n\r\n“Thad Bourgnese took me out to the Shack. Phil, it’s so silly, but you\r\nknow I’m halfway in love with this place? I feel like a stinker, I\r\nmean, I ought to be chewing my fingernails to get home, but I--well,\r\ndamn it, I’m _glad_ I couldn’t take the last trip down!”\r\n\r\nDefiant, she was rather more lovely than usual, he decided. “Well,\r\nfine,” he smiled. “I was just thinking about a job for you here.”\r\n\r\n“_Here?_ Dancer-in-residence?” But before she laughed, a look of\r\nsurprised delight had fled across her face, and an expression of\r\nchagrin had followed it so quickly it was unlikely any one but a\r\ntrained observer would have noticed the change from the first flush of\r\nreaction to the laugh.\r\n\r\n“Why not?” He did not follow it up; he was more than a little annoyed\r\nwith himself for having said anything to begin with. “Okay, kid,” he\r\nsaid. “I was just checking in on you.”\r\n\r\n“Right. I’ll see you, Phil, thanks for the call ... hey!” She reached\r\nto the side of the screen, toward where the tube slot must be, “There’s\r\na message. I didn’t notice.” She tore open the radioletter, glanced at\r\nthe bottom, and nodded: “Johnny.” Then her face went white, and her\r\nmouth started to open as if she’d been slapped in the face.\r\n\r\nThe screen went dead. “I’m sorry, Phil. ’Scuse me.” The audio clicked\r\noff too.\r\n\r\n_The bastard! The lousy lushin’ whining wailing nasty-minded bastard!_\r\n\r\nPhil went to the couch, knelt in front of it, and beat clenched fists\r\nagainst the padding till he felt his rage subside.\r\n\r\nHe got up, went to his desk, pulled out his own old-fashioned\r\ntypewriter, without which he could not think, and started typing.\r\nWhen he got up, half an hour later, he was Dr. Kutler again--and even\r\nPhil, plain Phil, had recognized that whatever Johnny wrote, it was in\r\nresponse to the knowledge that his wife did not want to come home.\r\n\r\nBecause she _was_ his wife--whatever _she_ thought about it.\r\n\r\nAnd she did _not_ want to leave, whether _she_ knew it or not.\r\n\r\nAnd it was a hundred to one, at least, that Johnny had picked the\r\nnastiest, hurtingest, angriest way to respond; but that was just\r\nfoolish--not vicious.\r\n\r\nA man has a right to react when his girl--or his wife--stands him up.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHRISTY TOPS McLFTY\r\n\r\n                  _Moon Man Takes Decision Over Congress\r\n                   Quizzer at SAC Subcommittee Hearing_\r\n\r\n  Mexcity, Sep. 6: “Chris” Christensen, Research Director at U.S.A.A.’s\r\n  Moon Dome, swapped questions and answers here today with Ray\r\n  McLafferty, East Chile Congressman, whose chances of election to the\r\n  Senate may hang on the outcome of the special hearings now being\r\n  conducted by his SAC subcommittee on Space Security.\r\n\r\n  Reporters present at the closed hearing agreed generally that the\r\n  scientist won this round. In answer to Committee queries, he outlined\r\n  a solid Security plan in operation now, and invited the whole\r\n  committee to come and see for themselves what conditions were.\r\n\r\n  Confronted with the till now mysterious “evidence” which initiated\r\n  Rep. McLafferty’s interest in Moon Security--a news item on new\r\n  research with “Mars-bugs,” which violated Top-Secret classification,\r\n  according to Rep. McLafferty--Dr. Christensen said that the contents\r\n  of the article had _not_ been classified, due to laxity in the SAC\r\n  offices.\r\n\r\n  The material, he explained--in spite of the obvious lack of interest\r\n  of some Committee members--had been contained in a Special Report\r\n  submitted by him to SAC for approval and financing on June 19 of\r\n  this year: Dr. Christensen’s proposal at that time concerned the\r\n  newly enlarged Biological Section, in charge of research on the\r\n  Martian micro-organisms (“Mars-bugs”) brought back in the ill-starred\r\n  _Colombo_ by Col. Johnny Wendt. The Moon Research Director requested\r\n  permission to move the Department, bugs and all, to an Earth\r\n  laboratory where Security would be maintained more effectively, and\r\n  the expansions then under consideration might be effected with a\r\n  great deal less expense.\r\n\r\n  His report was “not accepted,” said Dr. Christensen. Instead, he was\r\n  granted additional sums for personnel on the Moon. Apparently the\r\n  original report was never “processed” officially in the SAC office at\r\n  all, but Dr. Christensen testified that copies were made there, and\r\n  that he saw one himself which had been typed in that office.\r\n\r\n  The scientist added that some of the personnel funds had been applied\r\n  to expansion of the psychiatric staff of the Dome, in an effort to\r\n  solve the psychogenic problems that have made extended quarterly\r\n  Earth leaves mandatory for Dome personnel. The statement anticipated\r\n  queries from the Subcommittee regarding Security provisions during\r\n  such leaves. Dr. Christensen said there was _no_ way to insure strict\r\n  Security while the leave system was in operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rockland--Tuesday, September 6, 10_ P.M. (_E.D.S.T._)\r\n\r\nJohnny set the heli down on the lawn gently, feeling his way almost by\r\ntouch, without the field lights. He switched off the ignition, and got\r\nhis bag out of the trunk space behind the seat. Picked up the pile of\r\nnewspapers, climbed to the ground.\r\n\r\nHalf way to the house, he heard the noise in the trees and stopped.\r\n\r\n“Who’s there?”\r\n\r\n“Colonel Wendt?”\r\n\r\n“Who are you?”\r\n\r\nA man, middle-sized, middle-aged, middle-anything, as far as the\r\nmoonlight revealed him, came from the trees.\r\n\r\n“Colonel Wendt?” he said again.\r\n\r\n“You’re on private property, mister.”\r\n\r\n“You are Colonel John Wendt?”\r\n\r\n“What’s it to you? I said you’re trespassing. Now--_get out_!”\r\n\r\n“Colonel Wendt, I am a duly sworn deputy of....”\r\n\r\nThat was as much as he managed. Johnny dropped the bag and papers, and\r\nswung with the same motion. The middling man went down like a ripped\r\nsack of flour.\r\n\r\nJohnny grinned. He rubbed his fist, pleased. _First damn time I’ve felt\r\nhalf-alive_, he thought, _since_....\r\n\r\nIt was just as well not to think back that far.\r\n\r\nHe picked up the papers, grabbed the suitcase again, and let himself\r\ninto the house. He turned lights on, prowled through the rooms, looking\r\nfor--what? He wasn’t sure. Whatever it was, it wasn’t there. Everything\r\nnormal, just as they left it. Lee’s things still in the closet. _Well,\r\nwhat did you think? That she’d teleport them out?_\r\n\r\nHe switched on the field lights, went back outside. The man was gone.\r\nJohnny turned back sharply, went in and got the key, locked up behind\r\nhim this time when he came out. Went five steps and turned back,\r\nunlocked the door, went into his den, and came out a few minutes later\r\nwith a gun full of bird shot. He held it conspicuously in plain sight\r\nwhile he locked up again. Then he paced off the distance to the heli,\r\nwatching the trees to the right and left of the path closely.\r\n\r\n“Don’t mind shooting anybody trespassing on my property,” he remarked\r\naloud.\r\n\r\nHe was out on the field when he heard the crackling twigs of the man’s\r\nretreat. He smiled. Maybe instead of putting the ship up, he ought to\r\ntake off and....\r\n\r\nA brawl wouldn’t solve anything.\r\n\r\nBut it sure as Hell would _feel_ good.\r\n\r\nHe flexed his shoulders, felt muscles tighten, and decided regretfully\r\nthat he’d better get back in the house and stay there.\r\n\r\nHe hangared the heli, locked the garage, and went back indoors. Then he\r\ntook the stack of newspapers and spread them on the coffee table in the\r\nliving room. They were full of it, all right.\r\n\r\n                          CHRISTY TOPS McLFTY.\r\n                           WENDT TO BE CALLED.\r\n                     McLAFFERTY WILL GO TO MOON DOME\r\n                 SCIENTIST LAYS BLAME FOR ‘LEAKS’ TO SAC\r\n\r\nHe read with particular interest one headed, DR. C. SAYS WENDT SEDATION\r\nWAS S.O.P. SECURITY MEASURE, where he learned for the first time that\r\nsedation for the trip was ordinarily limited to the self-powered\r\nshuttle trips at each end: all other passengers on the shuttle that\r\ncarried him and Lisa to the Moon had been awake in the _Messenger_, and\r\nall but himself, coming down. According to Chris, the precaution was\r\ntaken in his case to avert possible efforts by “any agents of other\r\npowers” to get information they thought Col. Wendt might possess.\r\n\r\nChris also explained that his trip had been “only a visit,” but it\r\nsounded so phony, no one would ever believe it. Again Johnny grinned;\r\nChris was always a scrapper, when they got him mad.\r\n\r\nDamn, but a good old-fashioned street fight would make a new man out of\r\nhim....\r\n\r\nAnd get him subpoenaed. He figured to stay in the house for a while.\r\n\r\nOne paper had pictures of Lisa’s appearance at World Dome on Saturday,\r\nand a review, which mentioned the presence of Dr. Kutler among the\r\nU.S.A.A. party at the performance. “Miss Trovi was escorted by Dr.\r\nThaddeus Bourgnese, Chief Biochemist at U.S.A.A. Dome,” it said right\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\n_Well, whaddya know? We’re makin’ time, hey?_\r\n\r\nHe was startled at how calm he felt about it all.\r\n\r\nWhen he found the wire from her in the facs chute, with last Tuesday’s\r\ndate on it, he did not want to open it. He almost threw it out. _Leave\r\nwell enough alone. It’s done, it’s over. Forget it._ He had already\r\ntold her so. His own wire would be in her hands by now.\r\n\r\nHe wound up putting the envelope, unopened, in his desk drawer.\r\nTomorrow, he could decide what to do with it.\r\n\r\nHe did not drink. He went to bed at midnight, cold sober. To his\r\nsurprise, he fell asleep without trouble, and slept well all night.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dollars Dome--Monday, September 5, 9:30_ P.M. (_C.S.T._)\r\n\r\n  _Okay babe if that’s how you want it. It was fun while it lasted,\r\n  I guess. My least sincere congratulations to whoever--whoops,\r\n  whomever--the lucky man may be._\r\n\r\n  _Easy come, easy go, babe._\r\n\r\n  _Better luck next round._\r\n\r\n    _Johnny_\r\n\r\nShe must have read it through fifty times, looking for something, some\r\nclue, somewhere in it, that would explain what it meant. Because it\r\n_couldn’t_ mean what it said. That didn’t make sense.\r\n\r\nShe knew there were thirty-nine words in it. There’d been a movie\r\nor book once called _Thirty-nine Steps_. A movie--she saw it at the\r\nMuseum. Thirty-nine steps to where? Out. Right out, obviously. But....\r\n\r\nWhy? Because it was _Johnny_, that’s why!\r\n\r\nThere just wasn’t any other reason to find.\r\n\r\nThe phone buzzed. Phil. She’d promised to call him back, hadn’t she?\r\n\r\n“Hey, kid, you hungry yet?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“N-nnoo. Thanks, Phil.”\r\n\r\n“Well, how about a drink? A walk in the Mall? The way I feel tonight,\r\ngal, I’ll even go dancing with you....”\r\n\r\nShe kept shaking her head, but she smiled.\r\n\r\n“Phil, you’re sweet, but I think I better....”\r\n\r\n“I think you better listen to Doctor. Turn on your screen?”\r\n\r\n“Phil, honestly, I--”\r\n\r\n“Let’s put it this way. _I’ll_ go have a drink. Then I’ll come pick\r\nyou up. We’ll do whatever you want to do. Or just sit and talk. But be\r\nready in fifteen minutes, or you’ll find out--” He made that improbable\r\nleer of his. “--I ain’t like no lily myself. Hate to go banging doors\r\ndown, but”--he shrugged fatalistically “--sometimes, you know...? See\r\nyou. Fifteen minutes.” And he switched off before the seed of laughter\r\nturned to tears or gave her voice enough to answer.\r\n\r\nShe tried to call back, but he wasn’t in, or didn’t answer. She washed\r\nher face, and got dressed. She was just putting lipstick on when he\r\nknocked.\r\n\r\nShe nodded casually at the envelope on the bed.\r\n\r\n“May I?”\r\n\r\n“Go ahead.”\r\n\r\nShe watched in the mirror while he read, saw pain flush his face and\r\nretire, and the doctor face take over.\r\n\r\nFor a moment, she was certain that his pain was for her, and felt an\r\nanswering surge of--gratitude? Then she told herself not to be foolish;\r\nPhil had plenty of reason for pain of his own when Johnny pulled one\r\nlike this.\r\n\r\nThey wound up in his office. Two days before lunar sundown, the view\r\nfrom this side of the Dome was a sharp contrast in near light and far\r\ndark; but even the still-lit portion of the Moon’s surface was without\r\nglare, since the shadowless Dome itself filtered the rays of the\r\nlow-lying sun to give the moonscape from this window almost the look of\r\natmosphered land.\r\n\r\nThey sat in front of the window, with the inside lights off, and talked.\r\n\r\nThey talked all around it, brushing it lightly just once in a while.\r\nShe knew he would not push; but she also knew that she _had_ to talk to\r\nhim, now. He wanted to give her reassurance and friendship; but this\r\ntime she really needed advice.\r\n\r\nHe was rambling on about a theory of heart disease he had seen in a\r\njournal of psychosomatic medicine, when the right moment came.\r\n\r\n“Phil?” she broke in.\r\n\r\nHe stopped talking. That was all. No question, no look her way, even.\r\nHe knew she was ready.\r\n\r\n“Phil, listen, this mess is--well, I don’t know if I mean it’s worse\r\nthan you think, or better? If I could just tell for sure what he really\r\nwants--I mean--Phil, does he mean it? Or is he going to change his mind\r\nnext week, and come yell for mama?”\r\n\r\n“You probably know the answer to that one better than I do.”\r\n\r\n“I guess I already answered it,” she admitted.\r\n\r\nSilence. Then:\r\n\r\n“So I guess _I_ have to decide what I’ll do when he does?”\r\n\r\n“Or you could just decide what to do _now_.”\r\n\r\n“How do you mean--? Well, yes, I hadn’t thought of that.” She heard her\r\nown short laugh, like that of a stranger. “I’ll have to have someplace\r\nto go. And my things are all--well, that doesn’t matter. There’s plenty\r\nof _money_,” she said angrily. “That helps, doesn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“Where were you thinking of going?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I _wasn’t_. I wasn’t _thinking_. And I kind of resent you making\r\nme start now.”\r\n\r\nNothing. She looked at him. He was looking at her, smiling. An old\r\nfriend. He _knew_.\r\n\r\nHe didn’t know everything, though.\r\n\r\n“Phil?”\r\n\r\n“Hmmm?”\r\n\r\n“Remember that time I had lunch with you, right about when Chris was\r\ndown?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Remember I said Johnny might have to--to face up to something he\r\nwouldn’t like?”\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“Well--I--I’m pregnant, Phil. I thought so then, but I wasn’t sure.”\r\n\r\n_Well_, she thought gleefully, _I did it at last_! Phil Kutler had\r\njumped forward in his chair, just like any _normal_ man.\r\n\r\n“You thought so in _June_?” He was absolutely _staring_! “How far along\r\n_are_ you then?”\r\n\r\n“Well--four and a half months or so, around there, I guess.”\r\n\r\n“Stand up.”\r\n\r\nShe did.\r\n\r\n“Yeah. I guess so,” he said, and sat back again. “It _could_ be--at\r\nfour-and-a-half--with _you_. I’ll be damned!” He was watching her\r\nclosely, and, she realized, with a warmth of affection that made all\r\nthe rest of the mess _much_ easier. “So?” he said. “For heaven’s sake,\r\nsit down, Lee. I’ve had my look.” She sat. “Now: I guess that means\r\nyou--”\r\n\r\n“It doesn’t mean anything one way or the other, Phil. It just means\r\nthat whatever the rest means is _more_ so, that’s all.” Here she was on\r\nsolid ground. _This_ part she’d thought out beforehand, and carefully.\r\n“The thing is, Phil, that other time even, when I first _thought_ I\r\nmight be pregnant, I realized I couldn’t go through with it the way\r\nthings were.”\r\n\r\nShe saw his slight start, and smiled. “I don’t mean _that_. I meant\r\n_marrying_ him. I--”\r\n\r\nShe had kept herself beautifully under control up to then, but suddenly\r\neverything inside was clogging up. “I--” She stood up. She walked\r\naround the room, sat down at last on the couch, behind his back. “I\r\ndecided,” she said carefully, “that unless things changed a _lot_ at\r\nhome, if it turned out I was, I would just leave, and not--I mean, not\r\neven _tell_ him.”\r\n\r\n“But you didn’t. Hold up! _Does he know or not?_”\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. “No.” She looked up at him, feeling awfully foolish\r\nfor some reason. But it made _sense_, it all made sense, this part of\r\nit. She’d thought it all through, and through again. “Look, Phil, I\r\nwasn’t just being--well, emotional. I really meant it that way. But\r\nthen, right at that time, Chris came down, and Johnny agreed to the\r\ntrip--and then he kept putting it off, all summer long, and every time\r\nI thought, ‘He won’t do it after all,’ he’d set a date, and every\r\ntime it got close--well, you _know_.” She had to stop, and get the\r\nclogged-up stuff clear inside again.\r\n\r\nPhil just stood there. He put a hand on her shoulder, and she groped\r\nfor it with her hand, held on to it _hard_, and found she could talk\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you _see_, Phil?” Her voice was a wail, but she didn’t care. Her\r\nface was streaked with tears; it didn’t matter. “Don’t _you_ see? I--I\r\ncouldn’t let _Johnny’s_ child grow up with--oh _Hell_!--with _Johnny_\r\nfor a father. The way he’s been. _Could I?_”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you poor kid!”\r\n\r\nLisa was silent a moment. Then: “This won’t stop me dancing, I think?”\r\n\r\n“No ... no reason it should, for a while.”\r\n\r\nShe took a deep breath. “All right. I want the job, Phil ... and the\r\nsooner I get started the better. Lisa Trovi, Famed Tri-Di Star, will\r\ngive an impromptu recital in just one hour....”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dollars Dome--Monday, September 5, 11_ P.M. (_C.S.T._)\r\n\r\nMounting with the beat of the bongos, she climbed to the pinnacle\r\nin step with the quickening pulse of the piano; then poised,\r\nspread-winged, against the high-flying clarinet’s sharp sweetness.\r\n\r\nThe big wings rustled, swayed, started to move slowly back and\r\nforth to the pounding measure of the muffled bass. Back on the drum\r\nthump--forward on the twinkle of the cymbal--arms pumping faster,\r\nstronger, with each beat, while the bass jumped the tempo and the\r\ncymbals turned from tinkles to a crash.\r\n\r\nThe clarinet slid up and off the top of a final run; the piano faded\r\nslowly to a hush; the bongos fell in line behind the bass and cymbals.\r\nThen they stopped.\r\n\r\nFor one measure there was silence from them all. The single sound in\r\nthe crowded room was the flapping beat of the great gauze wings.\r\n\r\nDrums crashed--like the surf, like thunder, like an earthquake, like a\r\nbursting dam. With a final sweep of wing-width, Lisa leaped forward,\r\nbeating and fluttering, beating with the arm-wings, a-flutter in a mist\r\nof multi-hued chiffon--leaped out and downward, turning and twisting\r\nwith the slowing slant of the widespread wings.\r\n\r\nFrom the midstage high riser down to the floor, she floated like a\r\ndragonfly, drifted like a leaf.\r\n\r\nShe landed like a bright bird fallen to earth, in a deep crouch. Then\r\nwith the final cymbal-clang she thrust upward, outstretched on toetips,\r\narms back and open, head proud and lifted, her whole face brilliant\r\nwith the afterglow of music, of dancing, of climbing, of flight down to\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey clustered around her, smiling and cheering. Somebody stayed at the\r\nbongos, tapping out a light-mood intricate rhythm. Someone else went to\r\nthe piano, and began to mesh trills with the bongo jokes.\r\n\r\nTwo of the men lifted the dancer--veils, wings, and radiance--onto\r\ntheir shoulders and paraded her around the practice room.\r\n\r\nIn the deep armchairs shoved back to the wall, three couples sat in\r\nintertwined delight, watching, clapping, cheering the impromptu,\r\ncakewalk-conga-line that followed the accolade around the room.\r\n\r\nTwo women went out quietly and returned with a wheeled cart of\r\nsandwiches, cool bottles, frosted glasses, coffee and cakes. The men\r\nput down the dancer and claimed their own girls from the cart. One pair\r\ntook over an armchair vacated by a dreamy couple who left the party,\r\nholding each other’s waists with secret smiles.\r\n\r\nOther pairs settled down, or wandered off. A crowd around the cart\r\nsorted out into more couples, and at last left a mixed group, six or\r\neight, perhaps, standing and laughing and eating, drinking, unpaired\r\nyet.\r\n\r\nLee gobbled shamelessly, suddenly famished. She sat alone in the midst\r\nof the small group, watching, delighted, as the joy of her climb and\r\nfall spread to all the rest.\r\n\r\nThe darkhaired doctor stood a pace apart, just outside the laughing\r\ngroup, watching _her_. The hunger in his eyes found no matching thirst\r\nin hers; it flickered, and died.\r\n\r\nThe group remaining settled down to shop talk. Lisa left; Phil went\r\nwith her. At the door of her room she turned and smiled that marvelous\r\nmarvelling radiance. “They felt it, Phil,” she said. “They felt it\r\n_with_ me!”\r\n\r\nHe nodded and smiled back and watched her go in.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Acapulco--Wednesday, September 7, 8_ P.M. (_C.S.T._)\r\n\r\n“Kutler? Sure.... Hi, Phil, what’s up?”\r\n\r\n“How private is this wire?”\r\n\r\n“Hardly at all.”\r\n\r\n“Well--Did you call my friend?”\r\n\r\nKutler’s friend--Johnny? Chris couldn’t think who else it would be.\r\n“Tried to. Been trying. Jerk doesn’t answer.”\r\n\r\n“Figures. He wired. Yesterday, very negative,” Phil said. “Got his\r\ninformation mixed up, I’m afraid.”\r\n\r\n“Yeah. I can see how that would work. Well, he’ll get the source\r\nmaterial Sunday.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. That’s what I wanted to talk to you about. I’m not sure\r\nabout sending it now?”\r\n\r\n“Oh.” _Damn this open beam anyhow!_ “I don’t see,” he started\r\nthoughtfully, and Phil added:\r\n\r\n“I’m not the only one. In fact, it wasn’t my idea originally.”\r\n\r\n“Oh?” _Oh!_ The fat was _really_ in now, then? “Well, whatever you\r\nthink,” he said reluctantly. “Damn, I wish I was up there!”\r\n\r\n“Yeah. Look, there’s one other thing. That therapist I asked you to get\r\nme.... I’ve got an application from--”\r\n\r\n“Which therap--?”\r\n\r\n“Good. I hoped you hadn’t done anything yet. I’ve got a hell of a good\r\napplicant. _She’s worked with me before._ I just wondered if I could\r\nhire on my own, or if it had to be done through Mexcity?”\r\n\r\n“Wellll--I don’t know--” Then it all fell into place. “Look, Phil, I’ll\r\nhave to check on that,” he said. “I gather you want a fast answer?”\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid we might lose this girl if it goes through channels; I\r\ndon’t know how long she can wait.”\r\n\r\n“Will she wait till I get back up?”\r\n\r\n“I’m sure she could do that much.”\r\n\r\n“Right. I’ll check on it here, and we’ll get it worked out when I get\r\nhome.”\r\n\r\nChris talked a few more minutes with Bourgnese, about routine lab\r\naffairs, and switched off. Across the room, Jed was waiting with raised\r\neyebrows. “What was _that_ bit?”\r\n\r\n“Damn that open beam! I wish I could have had two minutes with Kutler\r\nalone. Sounds like Wendt heard the news on his own--or didn’t like\r\nher wire--or anything. I gather he flipped, anyhow, and either she\r\ndoesn’t want to go home, or Phil doesn’t think she should, or Johnny’s\r\nthreatened something, or--I don’t know. But that bit about the girl\r\nwho used to work for Phil--that’s how Johnny met Lee. She was doing\r\nsome kind of dance therapy with a group of Kutler’s. So I assume he’s\r\nthinking of using her now. Up there. I don’t know...?”\r\n\r\n“You _don’t_?” Jed was clearly amused.\r\n\r\n“Okay, so you were kidding about a job for her up there, but how’s it\r\ngoing to look--?”\r\n\r\n“You’re slippin’, fella,” the General said. “Think it through, man,\r\nthink it through.”\r\n\r\n  _Inside-Outside_: Like it’s a meteor shower of secrets from space\r\n  all over town this week ... not to say out-of-town.... Those\r\n  stories you heard about ex-Astronaut (Col.) Johnny Wendt chasing\r\n  the subpoena server off the family acres with a ray gun might be\r\n  slightly exaggerated.... Seems all Johnny did was pop him one, but\r\n  the SAC boys are takin’ it hard anyhoo.... Be a leetle charitable,\r\n  fellas: they tell me Johnny’s had a hard time lately. Not even one\r\n  dancing girl left to his name.... And speaking of dancing girls,\r\n  yummy Lisa Trovi, whose name has been linked with Wendt’s off and\r\n  on, is still Mooning over us. Her name came off the downbound\r\n  _Messenger_ passenger list at the last moment on Thursday for the\r\n  second week in a row.... Kid just can’t get herself down to Earth,\r\n  I guess, after the way she wowed ’em in World Dome....

Ragin’ Ray takes off Sunday week to\r\n  make the Moon scene for a one-night stand, but he’s taking a bunch of\r\n  the boys along to stay a week and have a good look at the Security\r\n  plumbing....

(_C.S.T._)\r\n\r\nHe watched her face through the clear plastic of the pressure suit\r\nhelmet, and tried to identify the “waiting” look. She was too absorbed\r\nto see him staring, but she wasn’t just thinking, or daydreaming.\r\nListening? That was how it looked, but not _quite_....\r\n\r\nHe touched helmets. “What do you hear that I don’t?” he asked.\r\n\r\nLee started slightly, like someone snapped out of daydream. “Hear?”\r\nshe asked. _Well, it was worth a try_, he thought. Maybe just plain\r\nfantasizing, after all?\r\n\r\n“_See_ is more like it,” she said. “I was looking at the design they\r\nmake. I guess I got half-hypnotized, following the lines.”\r\n\r\nHe looked. When he first looked, before he began watching her instead,\r\nhe had noticed only a small marble interweaving of ganglion-like ropes\r\nof cells. Now the randomness of the arrangement was less apparent;\r\nit _could_ hypnotize if you tried to follow the branchings-off and\r\nconnections between rope-colonies. There was a sense of _almost_-order--\r\n\r\nHe shook his head and looked away.\r\n\r\n“Damn! You know I never really _looked_ at them before. They _do_ get\r\nyou....”\r\n\r\n“Oh, they’re not all like that,” she said quickly. “Just the ones out\r\nhere. Every time you change the soil or air, _they_ change. One of the\r\ntanks in Earth-normal, you’d think it was full of just _dirt_--they’re\r\njust scattered through like regular Earth soil microorganisms. But\r\nthis Moon-type mutation links up this way, and Thad says--” That\r\nwas at least the twelfth time on the trip he had heard _Thad says_.\r\n“--says the things that look kind of like nerves _are_ actually linked\r\nup that way--I don’t mean, they’re really like _nerves_, but each\r\nrope is a separate colony, and he thinks they might have some kind of\r\ncommunication even, where two ropes connect. Either that or some kind\r\nof symbiosis or syzygy or--”\r\n\r\n“Thad says all _that_?” Phil broke in, laughing at the earnest-student\r\nmanner of her recitation.\r\n\r\n“And _more_,” she retorted. “But now _you’ll_ never know--We better get\r\nback, I guess. I’m supposed to make like respectable for tonight.” She\r\nstarted laughing, and took a step away so helmet contact was broken.\r\nHe saw the laughter continue, but the sound broke off in the middle.\r\nInside the pressurized half-track, she opened the face-plate, still\r\nchuckling. “It gets tougher to get dressed every day,” she said. “I\r\nmean, work clothes are fine, but when I have to get _dressed_....”\r\n\r\n“Well, take plenty of time,” he said, soberly. “I don’t know what the\r\nhonorable investigators would make of it if they knew, but it’s a sure\r\nbet they’d smell headlines in it.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll try to worry about it,” she said. “Phil, you know, it’s the\r\n_damnedest_ thing--I suppose I’m in a jam. Or something. I mean, when I\r\nthink about it, it’s practically classic--the unwed mother bit, and my\r\nman is sick-sick-sick--and probably half stoned besides--and here I am\r\ntaken in by the men in the Moon--maybe that’s what makes it seem like\r\nlovely nonsense instead of Something Awful?”\r\n\r\n“You’ve been pretty happy the last couple of weeks, kid?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she said quietly. “Yes, I have, Phil. And I mean what I was\r\nsaying--It seems like I _ought_ to be worried and troubled, but--I’m\r\n_not_.” She looked away, and back again.\r\n\r\n“Phil, I’m not even worried about Johnny. I don’t know what’s gotten\r\ninto me. I don’t mean I don’t _care_. _I do._ Just--it doesn’t _feel_\r\nlike anything’s wrong. We’re just apart for a while, that’s all.\r\nI don’t mean that’s what I _think_, Phil, just what I--Oh, _you_\r\nunderstand! You know, Thad says....”\r\n\r\n“Does he?” Phil said meaningfully.\r\n\r\n“Phil! You don’t think I--? Oh _no_!”\r\n\r\nAnd he actually believed her. She seemed not _too_ startled, but just\r\nenough--not _too_ scornful, just the right amount. And her laughter was\r\nfree.\r\n\r\n“Okay,” he said. “I retract. But quit saying it or I’m just as likely\r\nto start sulking.” He managed what he thought was a creditable smile.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dollars Dome--7_ P.M. (_C.S.T._)\r\n\r\nThe dining room on arrival days always wore a bloom of festivity. The\r\nonly decorative extras available were the glowing white onion-lilies\r\nprovided, one for each table, by the farm section each week\r\n(carefully cultivated in defiant evasion of the ubiquitous regulating\r\nin-quintuplicate official schedules of production and supplies). But\r\nthe bright plastic table tops were somehow gayer, the lighting more\r\nluminous, even the clatter of dishes and cutlery in some way more\r\ncheerfully hungry, at Wednesday dinners.\r\n\r\nThe big difference of course was not in the place but the people: and\r\nnot just that they tended to dress a bit more than usual, laugh a bit\r\noftener, talk a bit freer, but that they were _there_, all together.\r\n\r\n“Days” in the Dome were marked off by Mexcity’s Central Time; but\r\nwithout external dark-and-light cycles to pattern the twenty-four\r\nhours, the Dome worked round the clock, each person fitting his own\r\npreferred schedule into the complex of work-to-be-done. Ordinarily,\r\nonly one section of the dining room was in use; and it was in use at\r\nall hours, as groups came and went to and from their elected shifts.\r\nBut on Wednesdays, any one not absolutely required at his job was\r\nfairly sure to attend seven P.M. dinner, after the shuttles came in.\r\n\r\nThis Wednesday night, in particular, the Dome was out in full force--in\r\nparty mood, party dress, party manners--to welcome Congressman Ramon\r\nMcLafferty and his picked crew of super-snoopers.\r\n\r\nDr. Kutler was seated with four of the congressional investigators\r\nand three higher-echelon Dome scientists at a round table so close\r\nto the speakers’ table that he was literally back-to-back with Lisa\r\nTrovi. He confined his own part in the dinner talk to polite replies\r\nand concentrated on his uneasy appraisal of the behavior of the Dome\r\npeople at large, and an amused, but equally uneasy, eavesdropping on\r\nthe exchanges between Lee and the visiting congressman.\r\n\r\nLisa’s attitude seemed to be in keeping with the peculiar response of\r\nthe Dome as a whole to the invasion: a sort of high faith that warm\r\nwelcome and willing liking were enough to absorb anything from outright\r\nill will to malicious fancy to simple self-interest.\r\n\r\nThat McLafferty fell short of sharing this feeling was evident. _He\r\nknew_ the dinner, the gaiety, the enthusiasm that greeted him, were\r\nput-up jobs; he accepted them gracefully as his due. And he maintained\r\nthis knowledge, based on experience, at least half the way through the\r\nmeal. By that time he was so thoroughly conscious of the deep sincerity\r\nof Lee Trovi’s empathetic interest, that the stanchions of isolation\r\nsupporting his cynicism were sorely shaken. And when he rose to say the\r\nexpected few words after dinner, he was much too practiced an orator\r\nto misinterpret the swell of applause that surrounded him for either\r\nthe patter of polite boredom, or the too-regular thumping of planned\r\ndemonstration.\r\n\r\nChris used the moment to lean across and say a single word in Lisa’s\r\near. From where Phil sat, turned around, right behind her, the word\r\nlooked like, “Thanks.”\r\n\r\nShe turned to Chris, eyebrows raised, baffled.\r\n\r\nHe nodded toward McLafferty.\r\n\r\nShe cocked her head, shrugged bare shoulders: _What?_\r\n\r\nHe shook his head slightly. “Later,” he murmured, and sat back,\r\nwatching her and the speaker, his face carefully neutral. But Phil\r\nthought he saw an echo of the same unease he felt himself.\r\n\r\nLater, in one of the larger conference rooms, twenty-odd of the banquet\r\nelite drank coffee and brandy and listened to newly-arrived music\r\ntapes. McLafferty’s crew was staying a week, till the next orbit down;\r\nbut the congressman himself would leave tomorrow. Conscientiously using\r\nhis time, he made a point of speaking with everyone in the room, taking\r\nnotes occasionally with an air of apologetic industry. His manner was\r\nbriskly efficient, but leisurely--yet somehow it took hardly half an\r\nhour’s time to cover the group, and permit him to drift over casually\r\nto the circle of chairs where Lee and Phil sat together with Chris and\r\nThad Bourgnese.\r\n\r\n“You know, you fellows really have got something here,” McLafferty’s\r\nsmile should have been engaging; somehow it was not. “One thing,” he\r\nsaid, with a nod at Lee, and a sweep of the arm around the room, “You\r\ncertainly have the best-looking lady scientists _I’ve_ ever seen!”\r\n\r\nThad grinned. “I can see it now,” he said. “Headline: Congressman Gives\r\nLunar Ladies Blanket Clearance. Or: Selenite Scien_tistes_--hmmm--need\r\na verb with an _S_ and something about Security. Well--” He rose, made\r\na mock-bow to Lisa, who was laughing helplessly. “Beggin’ yer pardon,\r\nmum, you bein’ Medic in any case, and not Lab Staff, present comp’ny\r\nexcepted an’ all that.”\r\n\r\nIt could have been nasty. It wasn’t ... perhaps because Lisa’s laughter\r\n_included_ McLafferty? Or just that comment and reaction were both so\r\nspontaneous? Phil couldn’t tell for sure.\r\n\r\nBourgnese excused himself, and went off in the general direction of\r\nthe redheaded Donovan girl, leaving the seat next to Lisa for the\r\ncongressman, who had passed with astonishing speed through startlement,\r\nchagrin, mild amusement, and suspicion to sudden hilarious delight.\r\n\r\n“One thing,” he said, regarding Lee with warm approval, “You folks\r\ndon’t scare easy.”\r\n\r\nShe blinked. “What are we supposed to be scared of?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” he said. “_Absolutely_ nothing.”\r\n\r\nAnd damn if it didn’t sound just like he meant it!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rio de Janeiro--12_ A.M. _(S.W.A.T.)_\r\n\r\nIt was the fourth club that night, and he was positive he had said\r\nhello to all the same people at each one. He sat at a single table,\r\nwatching red and black and orange and blue-green female rumps writhe to\r\nrhumba beat and wondered how they contrived to stock each joint with\r\nThe Crowd between the time he left one and arrived at the next.\r\n\r\nNo more pub stops, he told himself firmly. Next time he’d go direct,\r\nmaybe to _Los Gringos_, yes, that was a good bet--tourist trap kind of\r\nplace The Crowd wouldn’t be caught dead in. Go _straight_ there, find\r\nout. If they were there anyhow, he’d _know_....\r\n\r\nHe could swear those jazzy bottoms out on the dance floor were\r\n_exactly_ the same ones he’d watched all night.\r\n\r\nHe finished his drink, thought about another. Hell with it, make the\r\nmove _now_, catch ’em off balance. He got up and started to weave his\r\nway through the full tables. The band had stopped. People were coming\r\noff the floor.\r\n\r\nBehind him, a voice he knew said high and clear, snide and cruel,\r\n“Well, she always had a yen for Phil Kutler--”\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen don’t slug lady bitches_, he told himself, carefully\r\nunbunching the muscles in shoulder and upper arm. _Leave it lay, lad.\r\nDon’t even look._ He knew he knew the voice, but he did not know\r\n_whose_ it was: best to leave it that way.\r\n\r\nHe dodged past a couple of strangers, got blocked at the next table by\r\na crowd of six sitting down. The high vicious clearness followed him:\r\n\r\n“But I’m not so sure that’s it. I can’t say _who_ told me, but it’s\r\nsomeone I _usually listen_ to, and the way _he_ heard it, the reason\r\n_Ray_ let that Moon scientist off so easily--”\r\n\r\nIt died away. Another voice, lower and less clear, urgent in undertone,\r\nblocked it off. Johnny’s way was still stopped. He turned, not meaning\r\nto; walked back past the table between without wanting to, went up to\r\nthe red-gown bitch who owned that voice.\r\n\r\nThe deeper, lower, one, the man at her side had been saying _his_ name.\r\n\r\nHe smiled, and he knew just how damned unpleasant that smile was.\r\n\r\n“Pardon me,” he said. “I believe you were saying something about a\r\nfriend of mine?”\r\n\r\n“Excuse me,” she said coldly. “I don’t believe--” She turned to the\r\nwhite-jacketed man. “Darling, do you--?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said wearily. “Johnny Wendt, Linda Har--”\r\n\r\n“Forget it,” Johnny said, suddenly sick of the whole thing. Why pick a\r\nfight with a perfectly nice guy over a bitch, or a pair of them? “Skip\r\nit. I’m sorry. I don’t want to know your friend. Should’ve cut out like\r\nI started to. Teach her some manners, hey?”\r\n\r\nHe turned and started to edge his way past the table again.\r\n\r\n“_Bob!_” The high clear vicious voice. _Yeah?_\r\n\r\nHe grinned. Nobody could say _he_ started this one. He tensed himself\r\nfor the hand that would touch his shoulder.\r\n\r\n_Okay!_ He wheeled back, driving from the shoulder as he turned, with\r\ngreat satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dollars Dome--11:30_ P.M. _(C.S.T.)_\r\n\r\n“Oh, I’m sure you _could_!” Lisa turned to Chris. “Where did Thad take\r\noff to before? He usually works this shift, doesn’t he?”\r\n\r\n“Usually,” Chris said--a little reluctantly? Phil wondered if the same\r\nthought that had crossed his was in the Director’s mind? Thad had left\r\nwith Rita Donovan; hadn’t Lee noticed? It wasn’t like her to be so\r\ntactless, if she had. And, he thought a bit grimly, it was unlikely she\r\nhad _not_ noticed. _Checking up?_ He felt almost ashamed of thinking it.\r\n\r\n“I was just telling Ray I didn’t see why he couldn’t tour some of the\r\nlabs _now_, if he really wanted to. Thad would probably be in Bio\r\nanyhow, and--”\r\n\r\n“I imagine Dr. Christensen has a more formal tour ready for tomorrow,”\r\nMcLafferty broke in smoothly.\r\n\r\n“Sort of,” Chris said easily. “But it wouldn’t make any difference\r\nthat I can see. I’m not sure Bourgnese is working tonight, but I’d be\r\nglad to take you around myself any time. We don’t go much by the clock\r\naround here.”\r\n\r\n“That’s what I was telling him,” Lee said. “Ray was so startled when\r\nwe came up to daylight again, he asked how we were able to stay on a\r\nregular schedule, and I was explaining how it worked.” She stopped and\r\nlaughed, a rippling silver sound that Phil recognized quickly as the\r\ntrained professional one. “_He_ said a place like this would suit him\r\nfine, because as soon as he saw the sun, he thought it was morning,\r\nand he was all ready to start a day’s work. So _I_ said, ‘Why not?’\r\nand--there you are.”\r\n\r\nChris shook his admiringly. “You Mexcity types always flabbergast\r\nme. If it was _really_ dawn, and he’d been at an all-night brawl, I’ll\r\nbet he’d feel just the same way.”\r\n\r\n“Company helps,” said the congressman. “Depends whom you’ve been with\r\nall night.”\r\n\r\nMcLafferty didn’t see it. Probably even Chris didn’t. But Lee winced\r\nunder the import of the heavy compliment, and threw the briefest\r\npleading sort of glance at Phil.\r\n\r\n_Well_, he thought. _Here we go on the white charger again._ He turned\r\nto Chris.\r\n\r\n“Why don’t you take Mr. McLafferty to see the farm?” he suggested. “You\r\nknow _that’s_ got to be working now--” All the Maintenance sections\r\nwould be. “He could see that stuff now, and the labs tomorrow.” To the\r\ncongressman he explained: “Wednesday night’s the one time the labs\r\nrun on skeleton staff. The big dinner throws everything out of whack\r\nwhen the ship’s in.” With considerable satisfaction, and at pontifical\r\nlength, he made clear to the impatient visitor that the obviously\r\nspecial-festive character of the earlier banquet was _not_ quite as\r\nspecial as he’d undoubtedly thought, but a weekly, normal, occurrence.\r\n\r\n“This is Saturday night in the Dome,” he wound up. “About the only\r\nthing you’d see in the labs now would be tapes and cameras and people\r\ntending them. But Maintenance runs all the time, of course. And I’d\r\nthink from your viewpoint, that part of the routine--that part of the\r\nstaff, for that matter--would be most--” He hesitated. “What would you\r\ncall it? Fruitful? Suggestive? Whatever it is, I’ll bet they’ve got the\r\nmost of it.” He turned to Lee, glanced up at the chrono above the Mall\r\nfountain. “About time for us to get back to work--hey, kid?”\r\n\r\nShe took it smoothly. _And_ gratefully. “I guess so.” The gratitude\r\nshowed only in her look at him, not in her voice, which held just the\r\n_right_ reluctance. “I don’t suppose--?” she said.\r\n\r\n“I think the way they’re coming along, by next week they’ll be able to\r\nhandle the one session on their own,” he said. “Or with me. I blow a\r\nmean tape, myself; I just don’t look as good as you tapping my foot to\r\nthe beat.”\r\n\r\nMcLafferty, without actually moving a foot, had somehow edged forward,\r\nsilently questioning.\r\n\r\n“Jam session thing we’ve been trying for a group that’s had trouble\r\nwith schedule adjustment,” Phil explained, marveling at the inventive\r\ncapacity of the knight-errant. “Idea is to create a regular emotional\r\nrhythm each day. Seems to be working out pretty well.... Oh, look, Lee,\r\nif you want to cut out this once, I don’t suppose it would--”\r\n\r\n“Don’t be silly,” she said firmly. Her smile was snakey-demure. “We\r\nwouldn’t want the Investigating Committee to think I don’t earn my pay,\r\nwould we?”\r\n\r\n“She thinks of everything, don’t she?” McLafferty said, smooth as ever.\r\n“Tell you what, Chris--why don’t we have a look at your farm while they\r\nget organized, and maybe stop in at this session afterwards--If you\r\ndon’t mind, Doc?”\r\n\r\nPhil thought it over. “Don’t see why not. Sure. There’s no actual\r\ntherapy at this. I don’t think the group would mind. Come on, gal.\r\nWe’ve got about two minutes now. See you folks later--”\r\n\r\nThe two of them hurried off, not-hearing Chris calling after them:\r\n“Hey, where _is_ this thing?”\r\n\r\n“Let you know soon as we do,” Phil muttered.\r\n\r\nIt was really no problem. They rounded up ten eager listeners in the\r\ndining room, and got set up in Lee’s practice room a good ten minutes\r\nbefore the touring party found them.\r\n\r\nAnd Lisa had no trouble getting two theoretical dormitory-mates to go\r\noff with her afterwards. “You know,” she said sleepily, “I think this\r\nworks more for me than for you folks.”\r\n\r\n“Night, kids,” Phil said. “Well, Mr. Mc....”\r\n\r\n“Call me Mac,” he said grudgingly. It sounded just like, _Your round,\r\nman! But don’t walk down any dark alleys_....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART NINE\r\n\r\n_September 25--October 3, 1977_\r\n\r\n\r\n  Acapulco, Sunday, Sep. 25\r\n\r\n  Dear Lee:\r\n\r\nThe General says he can get this to you with comparative privacy, which\r\nseems like a good idea. Apparently I don’t mind broadcasting my nastier\r\nmoods; it’s just if an unaccustomed brief spell of humility comes over\r\nme, I can’t stand to have anyone know I occasionally behave like a\r\ncivilized human.\r\n\r\n_If_ I do, or am, which is probably open to doubt. Particularly after\r\nmy last radiowire to you.\r\n\r\nYour reply caught up with me the first time the facs company had an\r\naddress for me, which was during a couple of refreshingly sober days\r\nin the Rio jail--great place, by the way, clean, spartan, healthy as\r\nall hell. Might have done better to have done worse (I took a poke at a\r\nfoul-mouthed ass in a night club) and been kept longer.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, it seemed a bit late, and hardly the place, from which to\r\nanswer your PS. Hoppen Harbridge also located me there; he’d been\r\nconcerned because of the subpoena for me being withdrawn. Thought\r\nmaybe it had been served instead and I was being maybe too royally\r\nentertained somewhere in private until T (for testimony) Day came. Man\r\nseems as uneager for me to take the stand as I am, which gets _me_ a\r\nbit concerned. (It will be no news to him when he reads this; I’ve\r\nalready told him so. I suppose I’d rather have him read it than him and\r\nevery other damn snoop or spy from how many? countries, which is what I\r\ngather already happened to our previous by-radiowire exchanges.)\r\n\r\nI seem to be rambling on, just possibly in an effort to avoid coming to\r\nthe point. Which is as follows:\r\n\r\nI’d very much like to take you up on your implied invitation. I have\r\nonly recently learned how much I need you. I learned it, babe, from\r\nToronto down to Rio, with many stops in between. Or amend that: I\r\nstarted in St. Croix, worked my way up to Toronto via home, and etc.\r\nBut in the process I learned a couple of other things, most important\r\nof which is that there seems to be remarkably little of Johnny at home\r\nthese days--barring some mixed crap and fury, a bit of which I got rid\r\nof in that Rio ginmill. Some more of which probably is creeping into\r\nthis letter, no matter which words I reach for.\r\n\r\nSo I need you; so what the hell do you need me for?\r\n\r\nAnd is it just what a guy wants most, to _need_ a dame? _You don’t\r\nneed_ me. You’ve made it damn clear, and I, belatedly, bless you and\r\nthank you for doing just that, doll. God help me, I do think you _love_\r\nme. Or loved, as the case may be. It occurs to me that with effort and\r\napplication I might learn to do likewise in return. If I can’t I can at\r\nleast _stop needing_.\r\n\r\nSo tell ole Chris thanks from me--or Kutler, whoever _did_ mastermind\r\ngetting us up there. I might have gone on leeching on you the rest of\r\nmy life, or yours (which might have been shorter; how long could you\r\nstand it anyhow?) if _something_ hadn’t happened to blast us apart long\r\nenough for me to back off and get a good look at J. Wendt. The veritas\r\nin vino is stronger proof in night clubs, maybe? Or were you watering\r\nthe stuff at home, babe?\r\n\r\nThe Gen. says 10 minutes, if I want to get this into the package. (10\r\nminutes with or without time for him to read?) So--\r\n\r\nI understand there is about to be a new subpoena for me. I’d enjoy\r\nslugging the next guy, too, but am temporarily convinced it is better\r\nnot to do so off home property, and also better to stay off home\r\nproperty myself for a bit, for many reasons, not all of them tactical.\r\n\r\n(Speaking of tactics, it’s only fair to warn Harbridge, which I haven’t\r\ndirectly, as yet, but will, that I am still on the other side of the\r\nfence. My distaste for McL. happens to be stronger than my preference\r\nfor throwing spokes in space wheels. But Gen., if you think you are\r\nharboring anything less than a viper in your bosom, be disillusioned.)\r\n\r\nAnyhow, this is to let you know that my immediate future plans consist\r\nof a knapsack, a couple of books which, if I bother to read them,\r\nmight bring me up to date in my supposed profession, and probably a\r\njug of honest tequila under a bough. The last is not part of the Grand\r\nReformation Plan, but should be mentioned as still the great likelihood.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I will have no address for a bit, so tell Kutler not\r\nto try looking. Even Harbridge won’t know where I am. (The Gen’s\r\nmysterious sources show that Kutler’s subpoena is already signed--like\r\nmy own--and will be going up same orbit as this.) As for you, babe,\r\nstay put a while if you can. You’ll hear from me, soon as I know what\r\nto say. Thanks for the chance to say anything. Apologies for what’s\r\nbeen said--for a lot of things, for me, I guess. Convey same to Chris,\r\nwill you?\r\n\r\nListen, babe, I am one crazy-mixed-up bastard, as you have better cause\r\neven than most to know--but for what it’s worth, I _do_--Hell, I can’t\r\neven say that. Let me say, I do _want to love_ you. If I make the\r\ngrade, I’ll let you know. Meantime--\r\n\r\n  Hell.\r\n\r\n  Johnny\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  FROM: Christensen\r\n  TO: Harbridge\r\n  DATE: Sep. 29, 1977\r\n  VIA SPECIAL COURIER\r\n\r\nSeems I missed a few bits, while McL was here. Phil says I have gone\r\nsoft in the head like the rest of the Dome people. That’s _not_ what he\r\nsays, but how I read it. He’ll undoubtedly explain his notions to you,\r\nand to you they might even make sense. You two boys should have a ball,\r\ncome to think of it. But I don’t know what I’ll do here on my own, so\r\ndon’t keep him away; I seem to _need_ a headshrinker for chief aide up\r\nhere. At least, it’s been working that way.\r\n\r\nWith that off my chest: McL’s boys have behaved themselves here. In\r\nfact, they’ve been too damn nice (which is part of Phil’s theory),\r\nprobably. To hear them talk today, butter wouldn’t melt and all\r\nthat, but we’ll find out, I guess, when they hit dirt again. Can’t\r\ngive you anything to build specific suspicions on, because what\r\ninvestigating they did seemed pretty damn routine and unenthusiastic\r\nto me. Mostly, they goofed off seeing how far they could get with the\r\nfemale personnel. Hope they got sent home happy, and appearances would\r\nindicate as much. (But it worries Phil; I’m getting an education, man.\r\nAlways thought psychers were supposed to be _less_ puritanical than us\r\nplain folks.)\r\n\r\nThanks for getting that letter to L. Big help. Phil will fill you in on\r\nher too; he finally let me in on it. Hope you didn’t--sorry. Was about\r\nto hope you didn’t really let Wendt out of sight, but I ought to know\r\nbetter by now.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, I am confused by a lot of what’s going on. Will try to\r\nget clearer by next week. Or am I missing some data?\r\n\r\n  PAC\r\n\r\n\r\nLUNA LAB LOVE NEST SAYS McLAFFERTY\r\n\r\nMexcity, Oct. 2: Scientific research is losing out to research in\r\nthe art of love among the elite inhabitants of the U.S. Moon Dome,\r\naccording to Rep. Ramon E. McLafferty, Chairman of the SAC Security\r\nSubcommittee.\r\n\r\nThe Subcommittee, which has been conducting Special Hearings probing\r\nSecurity leaks in the Space program, will turn its attention next\r\nweek to a “serious impairment of efficiency and morale prevalent\r\nin the Research Center” at the U.S.A.A. Moon Dome, according to a\r\nstatement issued after Chairman McLafferty conferred with members of an\r\ninvestigating team which returned from Moon Dome on today’s shuttles.\r\nThe Representative went to Baja California Spaceport earlier this\r\nafternoon to meet with the investigators immediately on their arrival.\r\n\r\nIn a press release issued after the conference, the nature of the\r\nalleged “impairment of efficiency and morale” was not specified, but\r\nanother paragraph stated that “the findings of the investigators\r\nare such as to suggest a thoroughgoing congressional probe into the\r\npersonnel of the Moon Dome and the moral attitudes and practices\r\nprevailing there.”\r\n\r\nQuestioned by reporters, Mr. McLafferty added that the testimony he\r\nhoped to produce at the new hearings would be of such an “intimate\r\nand personal” nature in “many cases” that not only will the hearings\r\nnot be live-televised (as was true for the Security hearings a few\r\nweeks back), but may be closed to the press as well. If this should be\r\ntrue, the Representative assured reporters that the entire proceedings\r\nwould be filmed, for subsequent release to the public, after editing\r\nto “protect any innocent persons whose names may be brought in either\r\nunintentionally or with malicious intent.”\r\n\r\nUsually authoritative sources close to the congressman said, off\r\nthe record, that there was definite evidence in McLafferty’s hands\r\nof “certain instances of loose living and certain unconventional\r\nsexual arrangements” at the Moon Dome. Rep. McLafferty’s comment on\r\nthis was: “We certainly do not plan to level any specific charges at\r\nthis time.” He referred to “unbelievable” conditions reported by\r\nhis investigators, and added: “We certainly will probe the matter\r\nthoroughly, and put an end to this sort of corruption, if it does\r\nexist, before it can become a national disgrace.”\r\n\r\nQueried as to whether hearings on the alleged immorality would be\r\nconducted by his Security Subcommittee, or by the SAC itself, Rep.\r\nMcLafferty indicated that he felt the security leaks originally under\r\ninvestigation by his team, and the new findings, were definitely\r\nrelated to each other, and that the hearings would continue under the\r\naegis of the Subcommittee.\r\n\r\nOne witness scheduled to testify during the coming week should be\r\nable to shed considerable light on “immoral practices” such as those\r\nalleged. That is Dr. Philip Kutler, Staff Psychiatrist for the Moon\r\nDome, who was subpoenaed by the Subcommittee last week, and arrived\r\ntoday on the same shuttle with the investigating team.\r\n\r\nReporters present at the shuttle landing at Baja California Spaceport\r\nsaw no signs of unfriendliness between Subcommittee investigators and\r\nDr. Kutler, but were unable to obtain any statement from the doctor.\r\n\r\nSubpoenas for a number of other members of the Dome staff were issued\r\ntoday, and shipped via Moon shuttle in the hands of a Dome staffer\r\nreturning from Earth leave who was sworn in as process server just\r\nbefore takeoff time. An official list of those named in the subpoenas\r\nwill not be issued until after service on Wednesday evening (when the\r\nshuttle arrives at Moon Dome), but among those named in authoritative\r\ncircles as probable witnesses were Research Director P. A. Christensen,\r\nwho testified two weeks ago on Security control; Dr. T. L. Bourgnese,\r\nBiochem Chief at the Dome; Leonard Lakeland, Hydroponics Technician;\r\nDr. David Chernik, Medical Staff; a number of female staffers, whose\r\nnames were withheld, and quite possibly the newest female staff member,\r\ntri-di dancer Lisa Trovi, whose appointment as Psychiatric Assistant\r\nmade headlines a short time ago. It was not known whether Miss Trovi\r\nwould be questioned about her own experiences at the Moon Dome or in\r\nconnection with Col. John Wendt, whom she accompanied to the Dome on\r\nthe mysterious visit six weeks ago about which the Subcommittee has\r\nbeen eager to question him.\r\n\r\nA new subpoena for Col. Wendt has also been issued, but since his\r\nrelease last Saturday from Rio Detention House, where he served two\r\ndays of a twenty-day drunk-and-disorderly charge, Col. Wendt has\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Acapulco--Sunday, October 2, 11:30_ P.M. (_C.S.T._)\r\n\r\nUnder grizzled hair, the General’s face was still strikingly young:\r\nthe tight-skinned smooth-jawed face of a man whose energies are never\r\nat the ebb. A man capable of restraint and of control, conscious of\r\npower, continually on the advance. A dangerous man, thought Kutler--a\r\nman almost without weaknesses himself, and entirely without empathy for\r\nweakness in others.\r\n\r\n“Frankly, I think it’s damned important,” Phil said crisply. “You\r\nknow better than I do what shape he’s in right now. But I wouldn’t\r\nwant to be responsible for what he’ll do when he sees _this_ bloody\r\nfoolishness.” He rattled the folded newspaper in his hand.\r\n\r\n“I’ll be just as frank,” Harbridge answered after a moment’s thoughtful\r\nsilence. “Of course Chris was right. I know where Wendt is, and I could\r\nreach him for you. But it’s a risk I don’t think is warranted. We’re\r\nin a position to--let me say, _prevent_ any wild behavior on his part.\r\nMeantime, I’d as lief not--draw enemy fire?--by contacting him.”\r\n\r\nThat would be final. Phil had hoped for the admission of knowledge,\r\nworked for it. Now he had it, and realized he had gained nothing.\r\n\r\n“All right,” he said tiredly. “You’re the tactician.” He was suddenly\r\nnot so much angry as disgusted.\r\n\r\n“Jed,” he said, and didn’t even realize till he was halfway through his\r\nspeech that the General’s first name had come naturally. “I understand\r\nyour hesitation about contacting Johnny.” _You don’t dare talk to him.\r\nIt would mess up all your thinking, wouldn’t it?_ “But in the event\r\nthat you should be in touch with him in the next few days--or have some\r\nmeans of sending him a message--I think you might do him a favor to let\r\nhim know Lisa is pregnant.”\r\n\r\nHarbridge had to repress a faint grin. So he had known all along. Phil\r\nhad counted on shock value in that one.\r\n\r\n“I had the impression the lady did not want him to know?”\r\n\r\n“The lady is of several minds in the matter. But I think it would be\r\neasier if Johnny felt that she sent him the message before he reads or\r\nhears it from some public source.”\r\n\r\nThe General thought that one over. He shook his head. “I can’t see it,\r\nPhil. It don’t fit. What you said about Ray McLafferty and this whole\r\nnew pitch fits fine. But not throwing the girl to the wolves. What\r\nwould he get out of it?”\r\n\r\n“Revenge?” Phil said, testing.\r\n\r\n“Revenge?” Harbridge smiled indulgently. “This is politics, Kutler,\r\nnot couch games.” He thought a moment more. “And let’s say Ray isn’t\r\nthe man I think he is--Why take it out on _her_? You or Chris, I could\r\n_maybe_ see. Why _her_?”\r\n\r\nThe man was good. Damn good. But from the outside only. Damn fine\r\nanalysis; no understanding ... no, that was wrong too ... no\r\ncompassion? ... no _insight_, no intuition.\r\n\r\n_We’d make a great team--if we could stand each other._\r\n\r\nPhil shrugged. “He’s not the only one to think about.”\r\n\r\n“He’s the important one. He puts out the releases.” Harbridge looked\r\nup sharply. “One thing maybe you left out? Ray’s not the guy to take\r\nno for an answer. Not very easily. He’ll damn well see to it Trovi’s\r\nprotected. For now.”\r\n\r\n“It may not be up to him.”\r\n\r\n“What the hell are you driving at, Kutler?”\r\n\r\n“He’s got a mess of subpoenas out. Including for her. People talk.\r\n_She’s_ not much of a liar either. Or take me.” _And take special\r\nnote of the fine set of rattles while you’re at it._ “It may\r\nsound quaint, but I have an aversion to perjury. So do some other\r\npeople--non-political types. Scientists. Like that.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t think _he’s_ overlooked that? Why in hell do you suppose he\r\nsacrificed coverage? He gives the press conferences.”\r\n\r\n_I’m damned if I’ll spell it out for you. I warned you. That’s enough._\r\n\r\nPhil shrugged again and let it drop.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Acapulco--Monday, October 3, 7:30_ A.M. (_C.S.T._)\r\n\r\nThe General had been awake for fifteen minutes when the call came.\r\nHe was still in his pyjamas, sipping his second coffee and reading\r\nthrough Chris’ message again, reviewing the talk with Dr. Kutler in his\r\nmind; he had just realized that he had never gotten around to hearing\r\nKutler’s pet theories, when the call came. He took it where he was, in\r\nthe bedroom.\r\n\r\nWendt’s face was taut as his voice, but he was in control. He looked\r\nsurprisingly young, tanned, and healthy. Could be quite a guy, Jed\r\ndecided, if he stayed sober long enough.\r\n\r\n“Saw this thing in the paper,” Wendt said, without preliminaries.\r\n“What’s the scoop?”\r\n\r\n“I can’t say for sure,” Jed told him. “And if I could, I wouldn’t on\r\nthe phone.”\r\n\r\n“Anything to it?”\r\n\r\nHarbridge shrugged. “You know more than I do. Last time I was up was to\r\npin eagles on you.”\r\n\r\n“That’s right--_sir_. I damn near forgot, didn’t I--_sir_?”\r\n\r\n“Come off it, Wendt. It was stupid enough, calling me. Don’t let’s play\r\ngames now.”\r\n\r\n“No, _sir_. Sorry to have bothered you.”\r\n\r\nJed saw his arm tense; he’d be reaching for the switch. “Hold on,\r\nJohn,” he said sharply. The damn fool call was made. Might as well get\r\nsome use out of it.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir?”\r\n\r\nHarbridge sighed. All right, two could play that, if necessary. “I take\r\nit you have decided to accept the subpoena?” he asked acidly.\r\n\r\n“I have my heli right here--sir--to go get it with.”\r\n\r\nJed grinned. “At ease, will you, Wendt?” He saw the other man relax\r\nimperceptibly, unwillingly. “Okay, as long as I know you’re a\r\nlaw-abiding citizen, and not calling to ask for assistance in this\r\nabsurd evasive maneuver--” He allowed just the comers of his mouth to\r\ntwitch slightly. “--I can tell you this much. My own opinion is it’s a\r\npersonal spite feud. I think he’s got it in for Chris or Kutler or both\r\nof them. I had a talk with Kutler last night and--”\r\n\r\n“Excuse me, sir. Are these Dr. Kutler’s opinions you’re giving me, or\r\nyour own?”\r\n\r\n“Both. Why?”\r\n\r\n“I’m not sure I’d put my faith in his explanations.”\r\n\r\n“They’re the only explanations I’ve had so far,” Jed said crisply.\r\n“Maybe next week I’ll know more.”\r\n\r\n“That’s what I actually called about,” Wendt said, dropping the\r\nmocking-game altogether. “Do you, or will you, know which witnesses\r\nwill be subpoenaed for next week?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know now. You’ll probably see it in the papers same time I do.”\r\n\r\n“I see.” His eyes made sure he didn’t believe a word of it. “I was\r\nhoping there might be some way to have a word with--one of the people\r\nwhose names I saw mentioned.”\r\n\r\n“Sure. Any time you get tired of hiding out, just drop by and I’ll\r\narrange a call for you. Glad to do anything I can. Stop by this\r\nevening.” He glanced at the wall clock, visible in Wendt’s screen,\r\ntrying to remind him that by now they _knew_ where he was. He thought\r\nhe got an answering flicker.\r\n\r\n“Well, I’m taking up too much of your time, General. Suppose I give you\r\na buzz tonight, anyhow?”\r\n\r\n“If there’s anything _important_ on your mind, sure. But, John--”\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“I--wouldn’t pay too much attention to the news stories. You\r\nunderstand?”\r\n\r\n“I think so. I’ll buzz you. So long.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Balsas, Mexico--7:45_ A.M. (_C.S.T._)\r\n\r\nHe left the phone booth, stepped into the hovering ground car, and took\r\noff on a cushion of air, silently. Inside fifteen minutes, he entered\r\nthe outskirts of Teloloapan, without incident. He parked the rented car\r\nneatly on a residential sidestreet, and grabbed an airbus downtown. His\r\nclothing would be least conspicuous in a working-class place. He found\r\na ginmill open for the go-to-work quickie trade, and settled down.\r\n\r\nAfter a week of water and coke, the Mexican beer was biting and strong.\r\nHe drank slowly; he had a lot of thinking to do first, and over that\r\nbridge there had to be room for some action still.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, there was plenty of time to think; and to drink--slowly. It\r\nwas too early to do anything else.\r\n\r\nAt nine o’clock, he began on the phone, trying to locate Phil Kutler.\r\nAnyone else would have been better. But like the man said, his was the\r\nonly game in town.\r\n\r\nBy eleven, the operator had him convinced that the doctor was not\r\nregistered at any hotel in Mexcity; the only forwarding address at his\r\nNew York apartment was Moon Dome.\r\n\r\n“Have you tried Decagon Information?” And why in Hell hadn’t he thought\r\nof that _first_?\r\n\r\n“Just one _mommmmment_....” And she was back--with Jed Harbridge’s\r\nAcapulco phone. _Great!_\r\n\r\nHe went back to his booth, drank one more bottle of beer, and decided\r\nto be logical this time. He walked down the length of the bar, toward\r\nthe sleepy-looking middle-aged Mexican who had perched on the bar stool\r\nall morning.\r\n\r\n“Listen, chum,” he said, without preamble, “I have to talk to the boss,\r\nand it irritates him when I make public calls.”\r\n\r\nThe sleepy man looked at him sleepily. “Senor?”\r\n\r\n“Oh come off it. Look, how about we take a walk? Get acquainted a\r\nlittle?”\r\n\r\nThe sleepy man thought it over. A faint glint showed in his eyes. He\r\nshrugged fatalistically, climbed down off the stool, threw a coin on\r\nthe bar, and followed Johnny into the street.\r\n\r\n“I owe you congratulations anyhow,” Johnny said. “I sure as hell\r\nthought I’d throw you this morning.”\r\n\r\nThe man, no longer sleepy, smiled. “It was nothing,” he said proudly.\r\n“I have long experience.”\r\n\r\n“Damn glad you do,” Johnny said, and meant it. “Look, I wasn’t kiddin’.\r\nI want to call your boss. I tried this morning, and he didn’t like me\r\nusing a public phone, so we couldn’t say much. If you’ll just--”\r\n\r\n“But _Senor_--” The man was clearly pained. “If I _could_, I would help\r\nyou gladly, but I have no means....”\r\n\r\n“I’m not asking you to give me your junior G-man kit or wrist\r\nradiophone or anything,” Johnny said patiently, “Hell, I don’t _want_\r\nto know what kind of setup you’ve got. Put it this way. I’ll go back in\r\nthe bar. You get in touch. See what the man says. Tell him I want some\r\nprivate talk, that’s all. Okay?”\r\n\r\nThe man opened his mouth. “But _Senor_--”\r\n\r\nJohnny said, “Fine!” and slapped him briskly on the back. Walked back\r\ninto the bar, sat down, got one more bottle, and nursed it, like the\r\nfirst three. He would make it last as long as he could. It was the last\r\none, either way. There was too much to do.\r\n\r\nJust _what_ was to do, he wasn’t sure yet. The first step was Kutler.\r\nAfter that he’d know. But for Kutler, he needed his wits.\r\n\r\nIf the sleepy man didn’t show by the time the bottle was gone, he’d\r\nhave to find some other way to get hold of Phil. Or make up his own\r\nmind, without Phil.\r\n\r\nBut he was goddam tired of sitting around waiting--for nothing. It was\r\njust about time to go get--\r\n\r\n_What? What you goin’ to get, boy? What’s_ to _get?_\r\n\r\nGood question. But it didn’t matter much. Just so long you could sit on\r\nyour ass, that’s all.\r\n\r\n_Rather get knocked onto it, hey, boy?_\r\n\r\nNot very damn likely!\r\n\r\n_Tough guy! ????_\r\n\r\nMaybe.\r\n\r\n_Yeh. I remember. Did some fancy gettin’ and goin’ before, hey man?_\r\n\r\nHe stood up. Carried his bottle to the bar. Stood a moment indecisive.\r\nPut the bottle down, waved to the barman and walked out. Find the\r\nsleepy man ... find Harbridge ... find Kutler ... find Lee.\r\n\r\nAnd there you were. Simple, when you came right down to it.\r\n\r\nLet ’em have their spaceships and cootie-bugs and truth drugs and\r\npolitics and screw ’em all. Including the pall-bearers. Let ’em play\r\ntheir games. Johnny Wendt didn’t care. Let ’em have anything they\r\nwanted, except _one_ thing....\r\n\r\n_The one thing is you, Lee. Lisa, Love, Lee, I want you._...\r\n\r\nHe strode out of the dim bar into the sunlight, arms swinging, teeth\r\nwhite in laughter against the tan of his face. A sad-faced woman\r\nin black gown and mantle scurried out of his way, crossing herself\r\nfervently.\r\n\r\n_Drunk or devil or what?_ he wondered. _What does she think I’ll do?\r\nDamn fool dames don’t even know a crazy man from_--\r\n\r\n_From what?_--\r\n\r\nHis laughter shouted in the street.\r\n\r\n--_from a crazy-in-love man. That’s what!_\r\n\r\nThe woman peeked back around the edge of her veil, and her face looked\r\na little less sad.\r\n\r\n_If I had a damn rose I’d throw it at her!_\r\n\r\nHe felt clean all over. Only _where_ in Hell was Sleepy keeping himself?\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mexcity--Monday, October 3, 1:45_ P.M. (_C.S.T._)\r\n\r\n“For you--”\r\n\r\nThe congressman handed the desk phone to the doctor with as much\r\nflourish as if it were a saber or pistol. Phil took it as cautiously.\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“Kutler? This is Jed Harbridge.”\r\n\r\n“Oh?”\r\n\r\nThen he realized there was no point in playing mum; McLafferty would be\r\nrecording it all, anyhow.\r\n\r\n“Just wanted to let you know: I’ve got an urgent call for you here.”\r\n\r\nThere was still nothing to say but “Oh?” The more so, knowing Mac\r\n_must_ be recording. Let Harbridge decide how much to say; he _knew_\r\nhis way around this rat race.\r\n\r\n“If you’re not tied up for lunch, maybe you could get over now?”\r\n\r\nPhil wished he knew his own way around better; which of these two had\r\nsharper teeth? And which was more likely to stick in a fight? And how\r\ndo you decipher what a man tells you in the presence of the enemy?\r\nAnd was it the enemy, anyhow? It was hard to see any real difference\r\nof attitude between the general and the congressman, when you sat in\r\nbetween them, as he literally was doing now.\r\n\r\n“You say ‘urgent,’” he formulated carefully. “Does that mean immediate?\r\nOr very important?”\r\n\r\n“Some of both. It _can_ wait a little. Frankly, I think the immediacy\r\nis more on _your_ end. Oh, look, I hate to sound cloak-and-dagger; it’s\r\nnothing like that. A personal matter--what you were asking me last\r\nnight. I’ll be more specific if you like, but I assumed--”\r\n\r\n“That’s all right, Jed,” he broke in. At this point, there was just one\r\nthing he had to know. And he saw no reason not to ask. “I take it it’s\r\nnot from the Dome? You said ‘personal’.”\r\n\r\n“That’s right.” Jed sounded relieved: presumably he, Phil, now knew\r\nwhat it was all about. He saw no good reason to let Harbridge know that\r\nhe knew less than ever now. All the personal matters he could think of,\r\nright now, were 250,000 miles away....\r\n\r\nExcept one. But he _knew_ Harbridge wasn’t about to let him talk to\r\nJohn. And if he _was_, why call him _here_ to let him know? That wasn’t\r\nit; and it wasn’t from Lisa. So it could wait.\r\n\r\n“What time do you go out?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Twelve, twelve-thirty....”\r\n\r\n“I’ll try to make it,” Phil said. “I think I can wind things up here\r\npretty soon?” He looked across the desk at McLafferty, who nodded,\r\nshrugged, mouthed, _Any time_....\r\n\r\n“Right. As soon as you can?”\r\n\r\n“Right.”\r\n\r\nHe handed the phone back. “Seems something’s come up,” he said briskly.\r\n“I want to catch Harbridge if I can before he goes out for lunch. So\r\nlet me jump in with both feet.” He smiled. “I’m not much good at the\r\nringaroundrosy you boys play, anyhow.”\r\n\r\n“You do all right,” the congressman said ruefully.\r\n\r\n“Thanks. I think. Look, is there still anything you want to ask me?\r\nBefore we do it in public, I mean?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing awfully important. We’ve about covered the ground.”\r\n\r\n“Okay. Then there’s something _I_ want to _tell_ you.” He saw the other\r\nman brace himself almost imperceptibly, and smiled again. “Relax, man.\r\nI didn’t say _tell you off_. I said _tell_. Like, information. What\r\nyou’re after. Pay dirt, man.”\r\n\r\nMcLafferty was mentally balancing on the balls of his feet, with both\r\narms up, guarding. _Change of pace_, Phil thought approvingly. _Always\r\nworks._ Reluctantly, he admitted he could probably get pretty good at\r\nthis kind of bull if he had to.\r\n\r\n“Okay,” Mac said, on balance again. “This is the sure-enough assay\r\noffice. Let’s see what color your dirt is.”\r\n\r\n“I assume anything I tell you here is confidential--I mean as far as\r\nthe press is concerned?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I can’t give you a blanket _yes_ on that. Anything you tell me\r\nthat bears on the investigation, I can’t keep concealed....”\r\n\r\n“I’m not asking that. Put it this way: I have a piece of information\r\nI think will be of use to you, and certainly of interest at least. It\r\nhas nothing to do with anything that’s happened at the Dome--or in\r\nconnection with the Dome--except that the person it concerns happens to\r\nbe there.” He stood up, walked to the window. He wasn’t sure enough of\r\nhis ability to use his face. His voice he could play with skill; but\r\nusually people weren’t watching him when he talked. “Frankly,” he said\r\nto the window, “I’m telling you this because I believe you’ll feel, as\r\nI do, that making it public would do no particular good to anyone, and\r\nmight do great damage to the person involved. It’s something that could\r\ncome out easily in the official inquiry, but--”\r\n\r\nHe had to turn back because this way _he_ couldn’t see the other man.\r\n\r\n“--Look, I assume you record conversations here?”\r\n\r\nMac looked pleasantly neutral; made no reply.\r\n\r\n“So I know I’m putting myself on a limb when I say this. But I’m hoping\r\nthat what I tell you will help you decide what questions to ask me\r\ntomorrow--or which ones _not_ to ask.” He laughed, a bit nervously and\r\nit took no effort to sound that way either. “I guess I better put it\r\non record, after that, that I’m not asking for preferential treatment\r\nfor myself or anyone else, but merely attempting to provide you with\r\ncertain background extraneous information which I believe will help you\r\nto frame your questions in such a way as to protect innocent persons\r\nfrom unnecessary publicity. Does that cover me?” He tried the laugh\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n“Beautifully. Ever think of going into the law?” McLafferty’s manner\r\nwas warm, inviting.\r\n\r\n“Often. I’ll return the compliment. _You_ ever think about\r\nheadshrinking?”\r\n\r\nThere was no perceptible difference in the warmth or sincerity of the\r\nlaugh. “As a matter of fact--often. From the other end of the couch.”\r\n\r\nThis man was much more his own type, as a matter of fact, than Jed\r\nHarbridge was. But Jed’s type, too--Phil became aware of an unfamiliar\r\nsensation of grave respect. The bland-looking man across the desk had\r\n_both_ kinds of awareness. _Talk about dangerous men_....\r\n\r\n“All right,” Phil said. “I’ve wasted enough time.”\r\n\r\n“Just one thing,” Mac broke in.\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“You understand I have made no pledges of silence or secrecy?”\r\n\r\n“I do.”\r\n\r\n“Okay. Shoot.”\r\n\r\n“What I wanted to tell you is simply that Lisa Trovi is pregnant.”\r\n\r\nIt was heart warming to see it register. _Bland_, hey? About as bland,\r\nbehind the meringue face, as baked hot peppers....\r\n\r\n“Man, you don’t think I can--?”\r\n\r\n“About _six months_ pregnant,” Phil said. He waited for the meaning to\r\nsink in, and added, “Well, five and a half.”\r\n\r\nMcLafferty smiled, but it was weak. “Wendt, I suppose?”\r\n\r\nPhil shrugged. “The lady won’t say.” He managed to make it quite lewd.\r\nMac’s eyebrows shot up briefly.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the congressman, “I see what you mean. I’m not sure--”\r\n\r\n_Busy brain whirring away_, thought Phil admiringly.\r\n\r\n“--You understand, I’ll have to give this some careful thought.\r\nOffhand, I don’t see how it really concerns this investigation, but--”\r\n\r\n_But you see all that lovely black ink, don’t you, man?_\r\n\r\n“--I’ll tell you one thing. I wish to Christ I could talk to Wendt.\r\nThis damfool hiding-out doesn’t accomplish anything.”\r\n\r\n_Oh, no, Mac! Really! How much do you think you can do me for?_\r\nAnd then, startled, he thought: _Well, whaddya know? Ole doc’s ego\r\nacting up! At this stage yet_.... And finally, amused: _Got to see my\r\npsychiatrist about_ that!\r\n\r\n“Wish I could help you,” he said smoothly. “Frankly, I’d like to get\r\nmy hands on that boy myself.” He reached out his hand. “Well, I hope\r\nyou’ll see this thing the way I do, when you’ve thought it out. I\r\nbetter haul out of here now. Can’t hold up the whole Decagon.”\r\n\r\nThe only thing that bothered him when he left was that he might\r\nhave underestimated Lisa’s effect--again. McLafferty ought to be\r\narrow-proof; but so should a lot of others. Who weren’t.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mexcity--Monday, October 3, 1:45_ P.M. (_C.S.T._)\r\n\r\nHe parked right inside the Decagon lot, and to hell with them all. If\r\nthey tapped him now, they would, and that was that.\r\n\r\nBut he knew it was damned unlikely they’d have a paper waiting for him\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nHe had no trouble getting to Harbridge either. He showed the guards and\r\nthe secretaries the same thing: his face and a five-dollar bill. He was\r\nupstairs in ten minutes flat, with the private secretary.\r\n\r\nShe was new. He said patiently, “Please just buzz and say, ‘Johnny’s\r\nhere.’ That’s all.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry, sir. I’ll have to have your full name.”\r\n\r\n“Let’s say I’m his long-lost son. Johnny Harbridge, okay?” Why not just\r\n_tell_ her? He didn’t know.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Mr. Prentiss--I wonder if you could--”\r\n\r\nJohnny looked at the smooth-young-man who had just entered. The\r\nsmooth-young-man looked at him, got noticeably ruffled around the\r\nedges, and said, “Just a minute, Glory. You--er--What can I do for you,\r\nColonel? I’m Al Prentiss, the General’s Press Secretary.”\r\n\r\n“Pleased to meet you, Al. I was trying to persuade the young lady that\r\nthe General would want to see me--since I’m here, I mean.”\r\n\r\n“I imagine he would,” Prentiss said, deadpan. “If you’ll wait just a\r\n_moment_, I’ll let him know....”\r\n\r\nHe went through a door across the room.\r\n\r\nJohnny waited.\r\n\r\nHe got tired of waiting, and followed through the door.\r\n\r\nPrentiss. Harbridge. Kutler.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he said. “Old Home Day. All we need now is Chris.”\r\n\r\n“All right, John,” Harbridge said wearily. “What are you trying to do?”\r\n\r\n“Brace yourself,” Johnny said. “Especially you, Doc. Sit down. It’ll be\r\na shock.” He strode to the desk and looked straight at Harbridge. “I’m\r\ntrying to find out how I can get to the Moon.”\r\n\r\nThe General shook his head. “You do need Chris then. I can’t authorize\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n_You’re full of bull._ “Oh?” He turned to Phil. “All right. Who\r\nauthorizes trips down? You or Chris? I--don’t think the environment up\r\nthere is quite right for Lee.”\r\n\r\nPhil shrugged. He was good at it. “Tell _her_,” he said.\r\n\r\nJohnny looked from the doctor to the general and back again. No point\r\nin crawling. Both men were set. He felt the inviting ache in his\r\nshoulder, and set it aside. If he was sure Prentiss would stay out of\r\nit.... He could clean up the other two without getting winded....\r\n\r\nGood thing Prentiss was there. Just as well.\r\n\r\n“Okay,” he said. “I’ll _do_ that.”\r\n\r\nHe started out.\r\n\r\n“Colonel Wendt?”\r\n\r\nHe turned, half-way. Bully-boy Prentiss. “Yeah?”\r\n\r\n“I just thought I’d mention--the backroom boys think it’s pretty sure\r\nshe’s subpoenaed. That would mean she’d be down next trip anyhow.”\r\n\r\n_Pacifier?_ He didn’t think so, somehow. The guy almost seemed human.\r\n\r\n“Thanks,” he said. “I didn’t think of that.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_New York--Monday, October 3, 7_ P.M. (_E.D.S.T._)\r\n\r\nThe city hadn’t changed; it was he who had.\r\n\r\nSuch a short time--and actually, very little had happened. _Very\r\nlittle. Sure. You just went right out of this world._\r\n\r\nSo: two years later--damn near--the doctor gets around to knowing what\r\nthe man meant. Phil marveled, not for the first time, at the ease with\r\nwhich we assume communication; fool ourselves into the oddly arrogant\r\ndelusion that we have heard, that we know, understand, even share, the\r\nconsciousness of our fellowman.\r\n\r\nPhil Kutler walked the streets of the city he loved, and felt\r\n_bruised_. Everywhere were barriers. Walls: not only of brick and stone\r\nand wood, but walls of tougher, harder, more hurtful, flesh and blood\r\nand emotion.\r\n\r\nHe wished, wished with all his heart, fervently, that someone in all\r\nthe millions of his city, could _hear him_ now--as he, finally, _heard_\r\nJohnny Wendt....\r\n\r\n“_Mars is heaven, that’s what_....”\r\n\r\nAs he had _heard_ Lisa--what was it? Four weeks--One month ago? It\r\nseemed hardly possible--and _understood_ that her need was not his own\r\ndesire. Understood it, and still desired--hell, still _loved_!\r\n\r\nIt was, looking back on it, highly improbable. _I am not that big a\r\nman_, he told himself soberly. And it was true. But he _had_ been.\r\nThen. _There._\r\n\r\nMaybe Johnny was right. Maybe men ought to stay where they acted like\r\nmen....\r\n\r\n_No!_\r\n\r\n_No, damn it, Johnny was wrong! As wrong as a man_ CAN _be_.\r\n“_Something up there makes us love_,” he paraphrased nervously, and\r\nadmitted it frightened him, and stopped fearing it.\r\n\r\n_If anyone was right, Doug was!_\r\n\r\nHe laughed. It was that simple. _Just that simple._ No one would ever\r\nbelieve it, but he was deeply sure. He knew, because he was certain it\r\nwas exactly what _he_ would have done.\r\n\r\nA stiff-backed, powder-caked claw-fingered female, rushing on\r\ntight-toed stilt heels, miscalculated; a bony shoulder knifed his\r\nbicep; a sharp elbow rose reflexively, caught him in the chest.\r\n\r\n“Whyncha look wareyagone?” she shrieked.\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon,” he said. And wondered what Moon-change would\r\nhappen to _her_, if she could go too?\r\n\r\nWondered, more practically, if that odd feeling of kinship with\r\nMcLafferty meant the other man had felt it too? Smiled, thinking:\r\n_All that work and sweat. And suppose the big oaf has turned into a\r\ngentleman?_\r\n\r\nIt wouldn’t matter much. Actually, all the sweat had not been needed.\r\nJohnny was already on his way.\r\n\r\n_Damned rude of him not to wait for me to push_, Phil thought,\r\ndelighted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART TEN\r\n\r\n_October 5-9, 1977_\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Shack--Wednesday, October 5, 4_ P.M. (_C.S.T._)\r\n\r\nShe switched off the half-track engine, and as the spotlight faded, the\r\nworld directly ahead of her blinked out.\r\n\r\nShe opened the cab door and stepped out into heaven. Above her, the\r\ngorgeous enormous full Earth, gleaming blue-greenly against the black\r\nvelvet stardiamonded backdrop of everywhere--always out there.\r\n\r\nAnd right ahead, now, the muted twin glows of the Shack itself and the\r\nShack guardhouse.\r\n\r\nShe flashed on her helmet lamp, picked her way over Moon crust to the\r\nguardhouse. Looked in, exchanged smiles, and went on to the Shack.\r\n\r\nShe sat down in front of the tank, where the greyish-white ganglions\r\nhad long since ceased to show discrete patterns. Now they crowded\r\ntogether, piled on each other, multiplied, multiplying. The daily\r\n“watering” of a month ago would have been hopelessly inadequate now; a\r\nsteady trickle of nutrient fed the tank from a storage drum--and even\r\nthe daily ten gallons hardly seemed to account for the burgeoning of\r\nthe white cells.\r\n\r\nLisa looked. Watched. Stared. And _listened_.\r\n\r\nA nagging thought stopped her. She switched on her radio.\r\n\r\n“Jim?”\r\n\r\n“That you, Miss Trovi?” From the guardhouse.\r\n\r\n“Yes. I meant to ask--will you call me at six? I want to get back for\r\ndinner tonight.”\r\n\r\n“Sure thing.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks.”\r\n\r\nShe switched off, and let herself drift into--what? where?--\r\n\r\nFar out. Or far in? That used to be a joke, _so far out you’re in, so\r\nfar in you’re out, but it’s no joke, it’s not funny, it’s fun_.\r\n\r\n_Swing on a star ... climb up a moonbeam_ ... featherlight, fearfree,\r\nfar sands of home.... _Hello!... Hello, I know you, don’t I?... Don’t\r\nknow your name, but ... funny-fun! ... the soul is familiar_....\r\n\r\nFoolish to want a name. Baby has no name. What name for baby? _Doug,\r\nwe’ll call him Doug.... Hello, Doug_....\r\n\r\n... and the well opened up again, great valentine lake of lovelygood,\r\nlace-edged, beating heart, two hearts in three-quarter phase....\r\n\r\n_Where are you? Hello? Hello?_\r\n\r\n_Oh!_\r\n\r\n“Oh. Oh, hi. Six _already_?”\r\n\r\n“No,” Jim, the guard, was leaning over her, helmet to helmet. “They\r\nbeen trying to call you from Dome, Miss Trovi. We kept gettin’ the call\r\non our sets, but you didn’t answer, so I figure your radio’s off, and\r\ncome in to tell you.”\r\n\r\n“Oh. Thanks, Jim.”\r\n\r\nShe switched on the helmet set.\r\n\r\n“Hello?”\r\n\r\n“Lee! Thank God! You had us worried. Been trying to get you the last\r\ntwenty minutes!”\r\n\r\n“Who’s that? Thad?”\r\n\r\n“Yuh. Listen, we’ve a call for you. Earthside. Better hurry. We can’t\r\nhold the frequency much longer.”\r\n\r\n_Earthside?_\r\n\r\n“Johnny!” She jumped up. “Hold it, Thad,” she said. “I’m on my way.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mexcity--Wednesday, October 5, 5:35_ P.M. (_C.S.T._)\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry, Johnny. We’ve been doing our damnedest. She’s on her way\r\nback now, but Relay will cut out in two minutes.”\r\n\r\nThe distant voice was Chris’, but yet not Chris. He couldn’t get\r\n_through_, somehow.\r\n\r\n“Okay,” he said. “Look, I don’t have to talk to her. Will you send her\r\ndown?”\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell her you called. I’ll tell her you asked her to come. I can’t\r\n_send_ her, Johnny.”\r\n\r\n“Okay.” _Bastard! You’ll tell her--yeah! But what? What can you tell\r\nher to be so sure she won’t want to come?_ “Okay. If that’s it, that’s\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell her,” the voice named Chris said again.\r\n\r\n“Hey! Chris! Listen!” He felt his throat tighten up, but the words\r\nsqueezed past. “Chris! If she--never mind if--Chris, can you make room\r\nfor me to come up Sunday? Maybe she ought to stay--”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know--”\r\n\r\n“We-are-sorry-to-interrupt-this-call-but-Relay-Station-has-passed-out-\r\nof-range-This-is-a-recorded-message-We-are-sorry-to-interrupt--”\r\n\r\nThe sound cut out. Johnny turned from the mike, and saw Jed’s hand on\r\nthe switch.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he said. “Thanks. I--appreciate everything.”\r\n\r\nHarbridge took a single step forward. “All right, Johnny. I’m glad\r\nwe could get you through. Wish you’d connected better. But I imagine\r\nshe’ll be down Sunday. She _is_ on the subpoena list, you know, so--”\r\n\r\n“She is?” He hadn’t even read that. He’d forgotten about it. The\r\nheadline was all he saw, really. “You--wouldn’t care to tell me where\r\nPhil Kutler is?” he asked, feeling the ice in his gut again, just like\r\nhe felt it when he saw the paper, her name, and Phil’s picture.\r\n\r\n  DANCER PREGNANT, SAYS MOON DOC\r\n\r\n“No. No, I don’t think I’d care to tell you that, John. In fact--Al,\r\nI think I hear your phone.” He looked meaningfully at the young man,\r\nwho undraped himself from the corner of the desk, mock-saluted, and\r\nleft. “Now let’s get something straight, John,” Harbridge said. “I got\r\nyour call through. That’s as far as I go. You had no damn business\r\ncoming in here again. If you had half a brain, you’d realize what it\r\nmeans if they get you into that hearing room _now_. If you care about\r\nLisa at all--Well, that’s your affair. But you busting in here is _my_\r\nbusiness. This is the last time you do it. Try it again, and you’ll\r\nfind yourself in the jug before you’re halfway in the main door. You\r\nfollow me?”\r\n\r\n“_All_ the way,” Johnny said. “Sir.”\r\n\r\n“All right. I’m going to do one more thing for you, and then I’m\r\nthrough. I wouldn’t do it for _you_; but it happens to be more\r\nconvenient for me this way. I’m going to get you the hell out of here\r\nwithout any of the process servers who are outside by now getting hold\r\nof you. After that, will you please, kindly, _get lost_?”\r\n\r\n“I hear you talking,” Johnny said tightly. “I’m not sure I follow you\r\nthough.”\r\n\r\n“You follow me all right. Come on.”\r\n\r\nJohnny followed. There was nothing else he could do. What counted now\r\nwas Lisa, Lisa and nothing else. No one else. If he had to eat Jed\r\nHarbridge’s crud, he could do that too. _And remember it too_--but for\r\nnow, he followed. He followed the General up to the private parking\r\nroof, and accepted the loan of a heli, and took off.\r\n\r\nFor where?\r\n\r\nHome seemed less unlikely than most other places.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dollars Dome--Thursday, October 6, 2_ P.M.\r\n\r\nThe woman was positively _glowing_ at him.\r\n\r\n“You _do_ understand, Lee? I can’t take a chance on letting him come\r\nup. Not now. Maybe in a month or so, if things quiet down. But one more\r\nmess now--I’m sorry to put it that way, Lisa--”\r\n\r\n“I _do_ understand, Chris.” She smiled impishly. “Anyhow, you wanted\r\npublicity, didn’t you?”\r\n\r\n“God help me, I did.” He looked at her suspiciously. “You know, I keep\r\nfeeling as if you’re just sitting there waiting for me to do a reverse\r\nswitch and tell you I’ve changed my mind and sure he can come.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it would be nice. Do you think it would help if I\r\n_concentrated_?”\r\n\r\n“Concentrate any harder, and--I don’t know. I know I won’t change my\r\nmind. If I _could_, I _would_ have, by now.”\r\n\r\n“All right, then.” But she still sat, smiling.\r\n\r\n“You sure you don’t want to go, after all?”\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. “I don’t _want_ to. And even if I did, it wouldn’t\r\nbe a good idea.” Her laughter poured out. “I can just see myself on\r\nthat witness stand!”\r\n\r\nHe winced. She stood up.\r\n\r\n“It’s all right, dear. I’m not _going_ down. Tell them to come get me,\r\nif they want me that much.”\r\n\r\nHe tried visualizing that one, and liked it. “I might just do that,” he\r\nsaid, and then reluctantly: “About Johnny, Lee. What do you want me to\r\ndo?”\r\n\r\n“Let him come up.”\r\n\r\n_Damn you, woman! You know what I mean._ “Short of that,” he said\r\ngruffly.\r\n\r\n“Give him my love. Tell him I want him to come.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t want to--well, send a letter or anything? I could deliver it\r\nmyself. Privacy--”\r\n\r\nShe hesitated. “No. No, I don’t think that’s the way. Oh, Chris, don’t\r\n_worry_ so! If _I’m_ not worried, why should you be? It’s going to be\r\nall right. _I know it._”\r\n\r\nThe worst part was: he believed her. You couldn’t _not_ believe, when\r\nshe was there with you. But--\r\n\r\n“Have a good trip,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Thanks. Take care of yourself, Lee.” She moved to the door with that\r\nfantastic grace she seemed to have developed lately. “Oh, Lee--”\r\n\r\nShe turned back, smiling.\r\n\r\n“If you don’t mind--I’d just as lief you stayed in Dome while I’m gone.\r\nI’d hate to think of you out at the Shack--Well, like yesterday. It\r\nbothers--”\r\n\r\n“Oh, stop _worrying_, dear.” She turned, and was gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Baja California Spaceport--Sunday, October 9, 5_ P.M. (_P.S.T._)\r\n\r\n“No, she didn’t come this trip.”\r\n\r\n“Well, what do you suggest, Dr. Christensen? Will you accept delivery,\r\nor should we return to sender?”\r\n\r\n“Can you tell me the name of the sender?”\r\n\r\n“I suppose--I don’t see why not. Colonel Wendt.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll take it,” he said decisively.\r\n\r\nThe Port Manager handed it over with relief. “All right. Will you see\r\nthe reporters now? They’ve been waiting....”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rockland--Sunday, October 9, 10_ P.M. (_E.D.S.T._)\r\n\r\nHe couldn’t see why he’d never thought of it before.\r\n\r\nAll the times he’d sat in this room and stared at that damn impregnable\r\nglass wall, and never realized he had something so simple that\r\ncould--if not damage it, then at least--make an impression on it.\r\n\r\nHe got up from the couch and picked up the five darts from the floor.\r\nTwo others stuck to the curved surface of the giant window, both from\r\nprevious tries. He had been leaving them there, timing himself to see\r\nhow long it took to get them all up. But that didn’t work, because he\r\ndidn’t stick with the game. Now he got an absurd satisfaction out of\r\nwrenching the two suction cups loose. He’d keep score the other way\r\ninstead--see how many _turns_ it took to get them all up.\r\n\r\nAt least it wouldn’t be too quick.\r\n\r\nNot that it mattered; it was ten now; if she didn’t call soon, she\r\nwasn’t going to. Unless the landings were _really_ late this time?\r\n\r\nHe dialed for the news, and sat back, not listening to all the headline\r\npart. Landing times would come at the end.\r\n\r\nThe first shuttle had been scheduled for five-thirty, Central time.\r\nThat was two and a half hours now he’d sat waiting for the phone chime;\r\ndialing for no-news; pacing the room up and down; opening the liquor\r\ncabinet and closing it again; getting--and forgetting--five cups of hot\r\ncoffee from the bleak kitchen.\r\n\r\nSomewhere along the way, he’d thought of the darts.\r\n\r\nGiven a near-impossible combination of luck and skill, you could make a\r\nsuction dart stick on curved glass one time in--how many? That’s what\r\nwas wrong with the first scoring system; this way he’d find out.\r\n\r\nHe threw all seven, one after another, as fast as he could. One caught,\r\nclung, dropped. The others just bounced. The phone chimed.\r\n\r\n_The phone!_\r\n\r\nHe reached for the switch, and the screen lit up, and--_damn it to\r\nHell, you fat bastard, where’s Lee?_--it was Chris!\r\n\r\n“She didn’t come,” Johnny said.\r\n\r\nChris shook his head. “She asked me to give you a message.”\r\n\r\n“Yeah? Okay, give it.”\r\n\r\n“She _couldn’t come_.”\r\n\r\n“No?”\r\n\r\n“The doctor says....”\r\n\r\n“_Which_ doctor? Ole buddy Phil?”\r\n\r\n“No, the Medic. She’s not supposed to take the trip till--”\r\n\r\n“You always were a bum liar, Chris. So she didn’t come. So?”\r\n\r\n“All right, I’m a bum liar. If you want to know, I wouldn’t let her.\r\nAnd you ought to have your head examined, for wanting her to. She’s\r\nbeen subpoenaed.”\r\n\r\n“Me too. If they get around to serving it.”\r\n\r\n“Yeah, but her left isn’t as good as yours. Do you want to hear the\r\nmessage or not?”\r\n\r\n“Sure. Why not? What is it? Love and kisses?”\r\n\r\n“As a matter of fact, that’s _exactly_ it.”\r\n\r\n“Okay.” But he had seen Chris hesitate. There was more. He waited.\r\n\r\nChris waited.\r\n\r\n“All right, spill it, will you? What’s the rest?”\r\n\r\n“You turning mindreader too?” Chris said nastily.\r\n\r\n“Leave it lay, man,” Johnny growled. “_What else did she say?_”\r\n\r\n“She said for you to come up.”\r\n\r\n“Okay. Got room next trip?”\r\n\r\nChris shook his head.\r\n\r\n“The one after?”\r\n\r\nSame bit.\r\n\r\n“_No_ room, huh? She stays up, I stay down, right?”\r\n\r\nChris never said a word.\r\n\r\nJohnny switched off and got out the bottle and picked up the darts, and\r\nstarted keeping score by how many belts it took to get a dart up.\r\n\r\nDamn things wouldn’t stick at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART ELEVEN\r\n\r\n_October 13-18, 1977_\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dollars Dome--Thursday, October 13, 3:30_ P.M.\r\n\r\n“It bothered Chris too,” she said.\r\n\r\n“I’ll bet. And you can’t see why?” He watched her face with every bit\r\nof intelligence and knowledge at his command. He found nothing there\r\nbut serenity--and some tenderness and amusement.\r\n\r\n“Phil, what on Earth--well, all right, what in Space--could _happen_?\r\nAm I supposed to be afraid of the dark?”\r\n\r\n“Everything spooky spooks worse in the dark,” he said. “And kid, this\r\nbit with you and the Shack has got spooky.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I don’t know what I can say to that.” She stood up, smiling, but\r\na little impatient now.\r\n\r\n“Lee--suppose I say you _can’t_ go?”\r\n\r\nShe did not seem to understand.\r\n\r\n“Suppose I _forbid_ you to?”\r\n\r\n“Phil!”\r\n\r\nIt was complete in itself. The one word said it all. _By whose\r\nauthority? With what right? For what reason? Darling--you’re fooling,\r\naren’t you?_\r\n\r\n“Suppose I said _Chris_ forbade it?”\r\n\r\n“You mean you want to know what I’d do if I were actually made to\r\nbelieve I _couldn’t_ go?”\r\n\r\nHe nodded. She thought a moment.\r\n\r\n“I’d try anyhow. Then if I _couldn’t_--I mean, _really_ couldn’t--” She\r\ngrinned. “--I wouldn’t.”\r\n\r\n_What does she want me to do? Throw my arms around her and hold her\r\nhere?_ Maybe she did: it was a nice thought, anyhow.\r\n\r\nHer smile changed, and he remembered, sharply, too vividly, that one\r\nkiss the day she told him about--\r\n\r\nThe baby. _Johnny’s_ baby.\r\n\r\n“Phil, I suppose this is the time to say it. You are the kindest, most\r\ndecent, most _loving_ human being I’ve ever known. Sometimes I wish it\r\nwas you who needed me.”\r\n\r\nThat was all. And it was enough. Of course that was the difference, and\r\nhe had, really, always understood, just as well as he did now.\r\n\r\nBut it mattered that she had told him. It mattered a great deal.\r\n\r\n“Thank you, Lisa. I _do_ love you very much.” The words tasted good.\r\nFresh. _Pure._ He was glad he had said them. “I--almost wish I needed\r\nyou too.” _But I’d rather love you._\r\n\r\nWhen she was gone, he sat and studied that one out. He didn’t get very\r\nfar. It was easy to analyze--simple masochistic crap. And/or false\r\nsuperiority: _Better to love and not have than to be needful and get?_\r\nFeed that to the pigs--or the bugs. It wasn’t for Kutler. Except it\r\nwas. So?\r\n\r\n_So nothing. So live with it. Someday you go back to Earth and get\r\nanalyzed, lad. Till then, don’t try to understand. Relax and enjoy it._\r\n\r\nWhich was the damnedest part. He _did_ enjoy it.\r\n\r\nHe got that settled in his mind; then he tried conscientiously to worry\r\nabout Lee. She had gone to the Shack again, of course. She was out\r\nthere now, dreaming whatever she dreamed when she stared at the wild\r\ngrowth there. It was _dangerous_--\r\n\r\nHe laughed. What in hell could be dangerous about it?\r\n\r\n_Spooky things ... scared of the dark_.... And of course: _scared of\r\nbugs_. Just that simple.\r\n\r\nHe stopped trying to worry.\r\n\r\n_But what made her think he and Doug Laughlin were so much alike?_\r\n\r\nHe was curious; he dug Laughlin’s pre-trip psych profile out of the\r\nfiles.\r\n\r\nShe wasn’t so wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rockland--Friday, October 14, 5_ A.M. (_E.D.S.T._)\r\n\r\nHe wouldn’t be able to do it until all the darts stuck. He knew he\r\nwouldn’t. But he knew when the darts stuck, he could. Easy. No sweat.\r\nHe knew just how, but....\r\n\r\n_Won’ work till they stick, gotta all stick_....\r\n\r\nHe kept throwing. Took a lot of drinks to make one stick. Got to do it\r\nsoon, run out of drinks otherwise.\r\n\r\nDamn bottle was empty. More in cellar, but cellar Hell of a ways,\r\nbesides he didn’t want. _Lousy stuff. Gets you nowhere._\r\n\r\nHe laughed.\r\n\r\n_Man, I wen’ nowhe’.... This boy did that job.... Yessir, Johnny Wendt\r\nwent, went nowheah atall...._\r\n\r\nStupid business, two darts won’t stick. _All the other ones stick,\r\nwhat’s matter with two?_\r\n\r\nMaybe no-good darts?\r\n\r\nHe picked them up again and took them to the wall. Stuck one on, then\r\nthe other. _See? Stick fine. See?_\r\n\r\nHe almost cheated, but it was no good, it wouldn’t _work_ unless he\r\n_threw_ them all and _made_ ’em stick.\r\n\r\nHe took the two off again and went back to the couch. Threw and picked\r\nup and threw and picked up and threw and picked up and had to get\r\nanother bottle after all and threw and picked up and threw, and _there\r\nyou are_.\r\n\r\n_You wouldn’t believe it, both ’fem stick ’tonce!_\r\n\r\nHe got up and went out the back door, feeling in his pocket for keys.\r\nSomebody came up and asked him if he was Wendt, but he fooled ’em, just\r\nsaid, “Man, I ain’t even come yet,” and kept going, to the garage.\r\n\r\nHe got in the car and _it_ Wendt. _Jus’ fine._\r\n\r\n_Wendt, went, when it went, Wendt went straight into the damn glass\r\nwall._\r\n\r\nTricky going for Wendt, but this man used to be crack pilot. Nerves of\r\nsteel--all that. Slambang into window-wall, crrr-aaa-ck, and slam on\r\nbrake, and _there you are_....\r\n\r\nHe climbed out and walked into the living room, feeling fine.\r\n\r\nNot many guys could do that. _Not damn few very many._\r\n\r\n_Crack-smash that damn wall and not touch a thing inside. Car right\r\noutside where it ought to be. Johnny inside. Good. But no damn curved\r\nglass wall. Seven damn darts and a couple of jugs, or a few maybe, and\r\nthe ole car, and there you are: no damn glass wall!_\r\n\r\nHe was tired. He lay down to sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Red Dome--Friday, October 14, 4:30_ A.M. (_S.S.T._)\r\n\r\nThey sat in a group around the woman, Maria. Nobody talked.\r\n\r\nThey sat for a long time in silence. Perhaps an hour, perhaps more.\r\nThen Maria began to murmur. Nobody moved. The tape recorder ran, as it\r\nhad run, since they started. Only two of them in the group knew English\r\nwell, but all of them _listened_ with the same deep attention.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time, someone came in and took over a seat from one of the\r\ncircled sitters. Maria stayed where she was, quite content.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rockland--Saturday, October 15_\r\n\r\nSomeone was screaming. It wasn’t Doug, because Doug wasn’t Doug now,\r\njust a million little Dougs and his leg itched where the Dougs kept\r\nbiting, _damn! damn Lisa, Lisa wouldn’t scream, ice cream, whipped\r\ncream, Lisa whip cream, lovely Lee, Lee, Lee...._\r\n\r\n“_Leeeee!_”\r\n\r\nHe opened his eyes for one moment, saw the ceiling of the living\r\nroom, felt floor rug underneath, and heard his own voice screaming,\r\n“_Leeeeee!_”\r\n\r\nHe closed his eyes, shut his mouth tight, moved convulsively, rolled\r\nover, and lay on the floor a long time, sobbing without sound, dry\r\nangry sobs that shook his frame and jarred his guts--but brought no\r\nrelease, so after whatever time, long time, it was, he stood up, got\r\nhis balance, and walked steadily through the house into the kitchen.\r\n\r\nTurned, went back through the living room and bedroom to the shower.\r\nShower first. He had a sour smell that sickened him.\r\n\r\nHe came out of the shower and blower and stood in the bedroom and\r\nthought it would be nice to sleep. _One drink and go to sleep...?_\r\n\r\nHe put his shorts on, and a shirt, socks, shoes. Cup of coffee, maybe\r\n... _might wake up_. He didn’t _want_ to sleep again. _Okay--coffee._\r\nHe started back through the living room to the kitchen. The house was a\r\nwreck, and the floor was full of broken glass, but that....\r\n\r\nHe saw the car outside, and remembered....\r\n\r\nThere it was. _The damn window was busted!_\r\n\r\nHow in Hell had he managed _that?_\r\n\r\nHe could figure that out later. And clean things up later. Right now,\r\nno time--first things first.\r\n\r\nFirst thing was Lee. _Quick!_ before he was too late. _Too late\r\nalready, anyhow: too late for Doug, for ever, too late._\r\n\r\nToo late for lots of things, too late for Johnny? Maybe, but if not too\r\nlate for Lee, then maybe...?\r\n\r\nHe remembered some more. He couldn’t go.\r\n\r\n_Couldn’t_ go.\r\n\r\n_Couldn’t?_\r\n\r\nHe took the word out, out of his aching head, and looked at it. Studied\r\nit, turned it over, tried to turn it inside out, but there it was, all\r\nthe time, like a neon light:\r\n\r\nc-o-u-l-d-n-apostrophe-t\r\n\r\nCouldn’t.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head tiredly, but the letters danced behind his eyelids\r\neven when he closed his eyes. He was very very tired. He took off his\r\njacket and went into the bedroom and took off his trousers and lay down.\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke again, it was dusk. He knew exactly what he had to do. He\r\nwas cold sober, not hung over, fiercely hungry too. But he was afraid\r\nit might already be too late to get things done today.\r\n\r\nWhich day? Friday? Saturday? _Sunday?_ Eating could wait.\r\n\r\nHe went to the phone, and flicked the switch, the operator thought\r\nhe was kidding, but she finally told him: Saturday. And almost eight\r\no’clock.\r\n\r\nHe went to the kitchen and made himself a sandwich with two thick slabs\r\nof rye bread and a stack of old dried-looking boiled ham slices from\r\nthe refrigerator. He was too hungry to care if it was dry or tasteless.\r\n\r\nHe took one large bite, wrapped the rest in a napkin, and shoved it in\r\nhis jacket pocket. He started out, then remembered seeing a quart of\r\nmilk when he got the ham. He went back, and drank all but an inch or so\r\nof the milk, right from the wax container. _Then_ he went out, a little\r\nworried, wondering if he’d done something to the heli too, that he\r\ndidn’t recall.\r\n\r\nThe funny thing was, he was so set on getting to someone from the\r\nCommittee, to tell them he’d take the subpoena now, that when the\r\nlittle man in the brown suit stepped out from behind the hangar, and\r\nserved it on him he didn’t even think to be surprised. The only thing\r\nthat startled him was the big bass voice asking his name; it came from\r\nsuch a _medium_ guy.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, a hundred feet up and building speed, he was astonished at\r\nthe man still being there. He shook his head and grinned. “Guts!” he\r\nsaid out loud to nobody, admiringly.\r\n\r\nLater yet, over Philadelphia, he had to decide which way to go, and\r\nrealized he didn’t know where they were firing from this trip. It\r\noccurred to him, hovering there, that he was not quite as clear-headed\r\nas he felt he was. The sandwich was still in his pocket, for instance,\r\nand he didn’t know where to go. Also, belatedly, he wondered if he’d\r\nhave any trouble with _this_ bunch about going up.\r\n\r\nHe kept on south. It would be either Andes or St. Thom, that much\r\nhe was sure of. Just beyond Wilmington he saw a field with service\r\nstations and no traffic to speak of. He dropped, left the machine for\r\nservicing whatever slipshod way the station did it, and went inside to\r\nthe phones.\r\n\r\n_Senor_ McLafferty was not at home. He was in Mexcity, at a verrree\r\nimporrrtant conferrrence.\r\n\r\n“Can you tell me where to reach him?” Johnny asked urgently.\r\n\r\nShe was most sorrreee, but the number was one she was not allowed to\r\ngive.\r\n\r\n“Can _you_ reach him?” There was no time for arguing.\r\n\r\nReluctantly: Yes, she could.\r\n\r\n“All right, now listen. Call him _right away_. I’m at a pay phone, and\r\nI haven’t got much time, and believe me, he wants to hear from me.\r\nMy name is John Wendt, you understand? The number here is Wilmington\r\nFive-seven nine oh-eight jay six. Please ask him to call me _as quickly\r\nas possible_. You got the name, now, John--”\r\n\r\n“Yes, _Senor_. I _know_ the name.” He relaxed. He could see the\r\ndifference. She did know the name, and she would call McLafferty. He\r\nflicked off, bought a soda, and sat down in the old metal chair out\r\nfront to wait for the call back.\r\n\r\nIt was midnight here. Ten, Central time. The rocket would blast at\r\neight ack emma Central, _latest_--seven, more likely--from wherever\r\nthey were shooting from. If the idiot congressman called back but\r\n_fast_, and if it was St. Thom, he could make it. Andes was probably\r\nimpossible even now.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dollars Dome--Sunday, October 16, 4:35_ P.M. (_C.S.T._)\r\n\r\nThad Bourgnese pursed his lips in a silent whistle, and passed the news\r\nwire across the desk to Kutler. “Here we go again,” he said.\r\n\r\nPhil glanced down the sheet rapidly. “Could be,” he said. “But I\r\nwouldn’t put any money on _where_ we go. Or he goes. Or--”\r\n\r\n“She goes? Obviously, friend: whither he goes. I mean, you’re the\r\ndoctor; you’ve noticed, I’m sure?”\r\n\r\n“Only thing I’m not sure of,” Phil laughed, “is what you mean. Was it\r\nthe belly or the heart I was supposed to diagnose? On second thought,\r\nthat’s not the only thing I’m not sure of. It’s practically lost in the\r\nmultitude.”\r\n\r\n“All right. Here’s another one for you. How in the name of all that’s\r\nholy did he get on that ship? Last time I heard Chris on the subject,\r\nJ. Wendt wasn’t going to hit Moondirt again till death did them.”\r\n\r\n“One of the many uncertainties I mentioned,” Phil said noncommitally.\r\n“You never know. A lot can happen in a week Earthside. Or maybe Chris\r\nwas willing to take the risk if he was on the same trip....”\r\n\r\n“The _trip_ wasn’t the problem. They could keep him under, like last\r\ntime. I dunno--the old man’s gettin’ soft, maybe--” He broke off.\r\n\r\n“Hi, gorgeous,” he said, as Lisa pushed the door open. “What brings you\r\nback from the Great Unknown so early and all of a glow?”\r\n\r\nShe gave him a smile-in-passing, but her question was for Phil. “Is he\r\ncoming _with Chris_?”\r\n\r\n“Dunno, honey. They’re both coming. Hard to say whose idea it was or\r\nwho’s talking to whom.” Thad was right about that _all-of-a-glow_ bit.\r\n_Pregnant women get that way_, he told himself, and now with Johnny\r\ncoming....\r\n\r\n“Hold on, beautiful. Didn’t anybody ever tell you it’s bad manners to\r\nlisten through keyholes? If we had a keyhole, I mean.”\r\n\r\n“But I _wasn’t_--”\r\n\r\n“They’re still running radiowire service, chum,” Phil stepped in. “Or\r\nwere, last I heard.” Odd, now it came time to accept the idea, admit\r\nit, quit nibbling around the edges, how easy it was. Damn sight easier\r\nthan querying and wondering about things that just didn’t _fit_, any\r\nother way. “Glad you stopped by, kid,” he said to Lee. “We’ve got to\r\nget moving with the new program. Never catch you any more when you’re\r\nnot working or sleeping or out visiting your buggy buddies.”\r\n\r\n“All right. But did you get the news report yet?” He nodded. “May I--?”\r\nHe passed it over.\r\n\r\nShe looked it through quickly and handed it back.\r\n\r\n“Nothing you didn’t already know, hey?” Phil stood up, trying to look\r\nbrisk and efficient. “The more I think of it, the more I think we\r\nbetter get that new program set up _now_. I have a feeling,” he said in\r\nThad’s direction, “I may be losing my chief assistant headshrinker a\r\nlittle sooner than I expected.”\r\n\r\nHe hustled Lee out of the room ahead of him, and set a fast pace for\r\nhis office. He needed a little time to think, before he verbalized into\r\nhis conscious intellectual Gestalt the reality that so far existed for\r\nhim only in awareness.\r\n\r\nAnd before the verbalizing, he had to determine--if he could--how much\r\n_she_ knew.\r\n\r\nHe closed his office door, and switched on the Busy-light. No approach\r\nlike the obvious, he decided.\r\n\r\n“Lee, how _did_ you know about Johnny?” he asked as soon as she was\r\nsettled in a chair.\r\n\r\n“How--? Oh. I thought you really thought I got a wire.” She looked at\r\nhim almost warily. “I told you before, Phil, I _knew_ he’d come. When\r\nit was time.”\r\n\r\n“Just feminine intuition?”\r\n\r\nHe had intended the remark to be neutral and light. It came out harshly\r\nsardonic.\r\n\r\nLisa sat forward, startled. “What do--” she started. She searched\r\nPhil’s face for--what? He didn’t know. Then she withdrew: her eyes\r\nturned inward; she sat back, not relaxed as before, but erect,\r\nspring-coiled for some as-yet-undetermined action.\r\n\r\n“No,” she said finally. “Not feminine intuition, Phil. How about just\r\n_intuition_? The kind anyone can have?”\r\n\r\n_Damn you!_ the outraged seeker within shrieked. _Bitch!_\r\n\r\nShe _knew_, and wouldn’t tell.\r\n\r\n_But does she know she knows?_ The doctor was back. “All right, I’ll\r\nbuy that,” he said. “For now, anyhow.” He stood up and went to the\r\nwindow. Looking out, because he couldn’t hurt her and see her hurt, he\r\nsaid, “Let me ask you another one.”\r\n\r\n“Yes?” She was all self-possessed again. That tender-amusement bit.\r\n_Okay, kid, brace yourself; you’ll need it!_\r\n\r\n“What makes you think Doug Laughlin was so much like me?” And he held\r\nhis breath. If he was wrong--or if she lied--he would never know which\r\nit had been. The words flew from him, even as he tried to call them\r\nback: once spoken, they wiped out all slower safer ways to know for\r\n_sure_.\r\n\r\n“Well, darling, there are so _many_--_Did_ I tell you that? I didn’t\r\nmean to. It was such a wild thought--Come to think of it, maybe it _is_\r\n‘feminine’ intuition, Phil. Maybe something to do with being pregnant,\r\nor--something like that? Because I sure do a lot of it these days. I\r\nnever used to. Not as _much_, anyhow.... Maybe I’m just more relaxed,\r\nso that I _know_ when I think something, or when I just--_feel_ it. I\r\nmean, feel it’s _true_, so if I wasn’t watching, or rather, if I were\r\nless _aware_ of what goes on inside me, I might think I was thinking,\r\nor think I had _heard_ it or read it somewhere or actually _seen_ it.\r\nYou know.”\r\n\r\n“I know,” he said. “I know very well. Because _I_ thought I _heard_ you\r\nsay that about Doug. And now you think you did. But you didn’t.”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t?” It was honest bewilderment.... He was _almost_ sure it was.\r\n\r\n“No, damn it, you _didn’t_! I _know_ you didn’t--because it just\r\nhappened, by pure stupid dumb good luck, that the recorder was on for\r\nthe whole conversation.\r\n\r\n“_Which_ conversation?”\r\n\r\n“The one that left me wondering why you should think that. I got out\r\nthe files on Doug, and decided you were pretty right. Then I remembered\r\nsomething I’d thought about down in New York, and I wanted to make a\r\nnote of it while I remembered--an insight I thought I maybe had into\r\nDoug’s walkout. Seemed more likely to be valid, after I checked some of\r\nhis reactions against my own. So I went to turn the tape on, and found\r\nout it _was_ on, and just for kicks, played back everything we’d said,\r\nmeaning to wipe it off afterwards, and--you’d never said a word about\r\nDoug and me. _Not one damn word!_”\r\n\r\nHe had turned as he spoke, flinging the words at her in passion. Now he\r\nturned from her white face and looked out again.\r\n\r\n“Phil--”\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\nHe heard the faint female-rustling sound of her moving, but wouldn’t\r\nlook around. She came up beside him. She too looked out, standing at\r\nhis side.\r\n\r\n“You know,” she said slowly, “It _could_ be that I’d mentioned it some\r\n_other_ time? And you remembered it just then for some reason, and\r\n_thought_ that’s when you heard it?”\r\n\r\nHe nodded. “Could be. When did you first think of it?”\r\n\r\nSlowly: “I’m--not--sure.”\r\n\r\n“But you think it was that day? Don’t you?”\r\n\r\n“Not in your office. The first time I thought of it, it was\r\nout--_there_.” With a tilt of her head she pointed to the Shack.\r\n\r\n“You were out there just _now_, weren’t you?”\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\n“When you knew about Johnny?”\r\n\r\nNothing.\r\n\r\nHe wanted to grab her shoulders and shake her and _make_ her face the\r\ntruth. He walked carefully away from her and sat down at his desk.\r\n\r\n“I want to tell you about something, Lee. You may have come across some\r\naccounts of this kind of thing yourself. It’s not too unusual. And\r\nyou’ve done some reading in this type of thing--”\r\n\r\n“Never mind, Phil.” She came back from the window and sat facing him\r\nagain. “I know where you’re going. Clairvoyant and--_telepathic_\r\nphenomena under hypnotism. Right?”\r\n\r\nHe nodded.\r\n\r\n“You know any clear-cut case?”\r\n\r\nHe nodded again. “A couple. Clairvoyance. Not the other.” He picked up\r\na pencil, studied it curiously. Just a pencil. He put it down. “Let me\r\nadd this, Lee: every case I ever heard of that seemed reliably reported\r\nand scientifically set up involved a performance _under hypnotic\r\ncommand_. That is, with the help of suggestion. There are at least two\r\nor three that seem clear of any suspicion of suggestion as to _what_ to\r\nsee. _Completely_ clear, I mean. But the subjects _were told to do it_.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Relay Station--Sunday, October 16, 5_ P.M. (_C.S.T._)\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time, the great harbors of Earth used rocket beacons to\r\nsignal to ships entering and leaving port: ships that rounded the\r\nglobe, sometimes, under no other power than that of wind and water\r\nwaves. At the ports of Space, rocket fire moves the ships in and out;\r\nwaves of sound carried silently on waves of electrons convey the\r\nsignals now. Otherwise, harbors have always been much alike. Even four\r\nhundred miles above ground, men sweat in their pressure suits; swear at\r\nthe intractable bulk of large masses (with or without “weight”); mill\r\nin apparent confusion, behind which incredible achievements of order\r\nand planned distribution move endlessly; roughhouse and rag and joke\r\nwith the blood-and-gut humor (and good humor) of haulers and movers and\r\nhandlers and drovers and drivers and sailors and truckers and spacers\r\nand all men who gain their daily bread conquering space-mass-time with\r\ntheir hands and backs.\r\n\r\nRelay Station is many things. Most ports are. It’s Earth’s eye on the\r\nsky and it’s the reflex nerve center of radio communication around the\r\nEarth. It is also a tunnelled labyrinth of intrigue and espionage.\r\nBut first and foremost, it is Man’s greatest port to date. Every ship\r\nof all nations that lifts off of Earth stops here for inspection and\r\nservicing and then for safe-passage through the vicious rays of the\r\nVanallens, infinitely multitudinous scyllas and charybdises of the\r\nSpace odyssey.\r\n\r\nFrom Relay, the Belt Balloons, air filled and skin-charged, each with\r\nits central pit of a single shuttle ship, are flung up through the twin\r\nbelts of darting electrons, to meet the great wheel of the _Messenger_\r\nin orbit at its 12,000-mile perihelion.\r\n\r\nAll passengers on U.S.A.A. ships have the option of sleeping through\r\nthe two first legs of the trip, till the shuttle is safely inside\r\nthe _Messenger_; but the more knowing ones come out of sedation at\r\nRelay, in hopes of traveling close enough to other Balloons to see for\r\nthemselves the coruscating display of blue fire, as the wild electrons\r\nof the Belts are dashed off the charged thin skins of the bulleting\r\nspheres.\r\n\r\nJohn Wendt had never seen the Belt Balloons. When he lived and trained\r\non the Moon, and took rare leaves on Earth, the _Messenger_, with its\r\nion drive and thermal exchange power plant, was still a drawing-board\r\ndream. The thrice he had traveled by shuttle, via Balloon and the\r\n_Messenger_, he had made the whole voyage under sedation.\r\n\r\nHis choice of minimum sleep this time out was not motivated by a desire\r\nto see the Balloons. He had avoided exposure to Space talk, Space news,\r\nSpace views, so thoroughly in his twenty months on Earth that he did\r\nnot even _know_ there was anything worth seeing.\r\n\r\nHe simply meant to let Pete Christensen, and anybody else who noticed,\r\nknow that he _could_ make the trip. _Wide awake._\r\n\r\nHe was a little sorry when he learned that Chris was on the first\r\nshuttle, the one that left ten minutes before Mac got him to the St.\r\nThom Port and through the snarl of red tape that wound him up on\r\nShuttle Two. But he assumed there would be communication between the\r\ntwo boats, once on board the _Messenger_. Certainly, the Dome Director\r\nwould be free to go between shuttles, and certainly, he would be\r\napprised of the change in the passenger list at the first opportunity.\r\n\r\nJohnny looked forward to seeing Chris when the time came. The shoe had\r\nchanged feet, and it fit one hell of a sight better.\r\n\r\nHe never did get to see Shuttle One crackling spectacularly through the\r\nouter edge of the Big Belt, as Two’s balloon entered Little Belt; he\r\nwas much too sophisticated a Space traveler to crowd to the viewports\r\nwhen the others did.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dollars Dome--Monday, October 17, 2_ P.M. (_C.S.T._)\r\n\r\n“That ought to fix you up now, Miss Trovi.” He fastened the buckle that\r\nheld the miniature set strapped to her suit, and said, “Now if you want\r\nto just show me how you’d work it, make sure you got it right...?”\r\n\r\nLisa unstrapped the kit, took out the tape, put it back in, switched\r\nthe set to _record_, and turned it off again. “I’d better try it with\r\nthe helmet, don’t you think?” she said doubtfully.\r\n\r\n“Sure. Good idea.” The big mechanic beamed down at her as if he had\r\npersonally built the whole combination, and not just the small machine.\r\nBut when he reached to help her adjust the wire trailing from the mike\r\nin the headpiece, she shook her head and waved him off:\r\n\r\n“I’ve got to be able to do it myself.”\r\n\r\nIt worked fine. She put three extra rolls of tape in her pocket,\r\nthanked him, and left. The big man watched her go, shaking his head.\r\n\r\n“Guts!” he said. “Damn but that babe has guts!” He went back into the\r\nworkshop and told his helper, “That bastard Wendt don’t come through,\r\nI bet there ain’t a single man here wouldn’t marry her, the day before\r\nthe kid’s born, or the day after. And mop up the sonofabitch before\r\ndinner besides.”\r\n\r\n“One mistake, chum.” The helper was married. “You don’t know how easy\r\nit is to get a divorce. Don’t just say _single_ men.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Red Dome--Tuesday, October 18, 9:25_ A.M. (_C.S.T._)\r\n\r\nThe Guards Lieutenant saluted with military precision, which was\r\nworse than wasted on Dr. Chen. The Director was not even annoyed; the\r\nirritation of acknowledging the salute never materialized, because the\r\nnecessity to do so failed to impress him. Dr. Chen could be exceedingly\r\nsingle-minded on some occasions. He had a superior capacity for crisis\r\naction.\r\n\r\nHe also had a crisis.\r\n\r\nAnd he noted, with some detached part of his mind, that he was enjoying\r\nit enormously.\r\n\r\nIt was a long time since there had been any real emergency or crisis in\r\nthe Dome.\r\n\r\nThis one was not in it either.\r\n\r\n“Very well,” he said crisply. “You will please explain to me how she\r\ncontrived to leave?”\r\n\r\n“She is a good pilot, Comrade Your Excellency. She holds all necessary\r\npermits and licenses.”\r\n\r\n“There are no permits or licenses to leave the Dome,” Chen said coldly,\r\n“except express assignment from me.”\r\n\r\nThe young officer said nothing.\r\n\r\nThe Director considered the words that might best express his scorn and\r\ncontempt for the so-called Guard who had permitted Maria Harounian to\r\nleave the Dome. Having considered them and relished them, he filed them\r\nin his mind, and said to the dutiful Lieutenant, whose fault it was\r\n_not_:\r\n\r\n“I want Harounian found and returned to Dome immediately.”\r\n\r\nHe did not stress the words. He spoke almost softly. But his meaning\r\nwas deadly clear. “Organize a search,” he said. “A full search. I will\r\nreview your search plan in fifteen minutes. Excused.”\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant saluted again. Dr. Chen acknowledged with the faintest\r\npossible nod.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART TWELVE\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, October 19, 1977_\r\n\r\n\r\n_Messenger--7:45_ A.M. (_C.S.T._)\r\n\r\nHe came awake to vicious clarity. The long dreamless pill-induced sleep\r\nhad left him over-rested, too fresh, too thinking, conscious, and aware.\r\n\r\nBut this was Wednesday: the last day. He’d be in the Dome that night.\r\nHe was not absolutely sure he could make it. For the first Goddam time\r\nin his life, he was not certain he would be able to come through.\r\n\r\nSomething strangely like exultation surged through him.\r\n\r\n_And what in hell was that for?_ What was so special about not being\r\ngood enough?\r\n\r\nHe knew, but damned if he’d tell himself.\r\n\r\nOne thing he told himself, all right, at the beginning, and that was\r\nstill good. He got through Sunday and Monday and Tuesday; he could make\r\nit through ten more hours and stick with it. Maybe he’d crack up and\r\ngo tell Chris off or open an air lock or any damn thing. But he wasn’t\r\ndrinking this trip. Not _this_ trip.\r\n\r\nWhatever happened _after_ he got there, he’d _get_ there cold sober.\r\nThen it was up to her....\r\n\r\nMonday night was the worst. Monday night and Tuesday. He got through\r\nthat all right, he could make ten lousy hours. But he hadn’t had a\r\ngoddam drink yet, and he wasn’t going to. Not _this_ trip....\r\n\r\n_Ten hours?_\r\n\r\nThe bastard was jeering at him. _So okay, laugh. Ten hours is pretty\r\ndamn long. Yeah._\r\n\r\nHe got up, and planned his time. _Breakfast._ That was as far as he\r\ncould get. _Lunch, later._ And all the time in between.\r\n\r\nSunday, and Monday morning he had seen the control rooms and comm rooms\r\nand cargo shuttles and climbed around the massive ion engine. The heat\r\nexchangers were old stuff; so was most of the rest. But he had looked\r\nat everything, examined, inspected. He could handle this job himself if\r\nhe had to now. He didn’t have to. Basil would. Basil ... he’d trained\r\nwith Laughlin and Wendt, but wasn’t tapped for the _Colombo_ trip. So\r\nnow he was a Space ferry jockey....\r\n\r\n_Good boy, Basil, he made the grade. Didn’t go too far out like we\r\ndid._...\r\n\r\nBasil would brake into Zeroville orbit. _Should have started by now_,\r\nhe thought, _shouldn’t they?_ Then he _felt_ the difference, and knew\r\nhe’d been feeling it all along. Deceleration. Not much yet, but you\r\nstarted easy with ions and let it build. No blast, no sweat.\r\n\r\nMonday, after lunch, nothing to do except sit in the damn lounge and\r\nwatch them all lushin’ it up. Hell with that. Hell of a trip not to\r\ndrink on; nothing else to do. Half the victims got stoned first night\r\nout and _stayed_ that way.\r\n\r\nHe spent Monday afternoon in the dining room, drinking coffee, watching\r\nout the pretty picture window while the Moon came around and around,\r\nbigger each time--if you happened to have micro-calipers to measure\r\nwith. He stared out long enough so he found out one thing: empty Space\r\ndidn’t bug him at all. He already knew that the birds were okay. He had\r\nalmost enjoyed it, going through the business end of the wheel with the\r\nguys. It wasn’t _going_ that bugged him; it was _where_ the Hell you\r\nwent.\r\n\r\nWhich was just what he’d said all along. But now he _knew_. Chris had\r\nkept him knocked out the whole trip up and back before; so _they_\r\nhadn’t been so damn sure either...? Well, now _he_ was.\r\n\r\nHe sat there until Chris came in and saw him. Then he sat there long\r\nenough to make sure Chris knew he was looking _out_. Then he swung down\r\nto the crew lounge and found a poker game getting under way.\r\n\r\nHe was okay till the game broke up. After that, it was bad. That was\r\nthe only time he almost broke down. A couple of shots would’ve put him\r\nto sleep at least. He spent the time from two in the morning till six,\r\nwhen they started to serve breakfast, sitting in the damn dark dining\r\nroom, watching the Moon grow so slowly you didn’t know it, except that\r\nyou _knew_ it.\r\n\r\nAfter people started to show up, it was better; he had to keep up some\r\nfront, when they were watching him.\r\n\r\nChris stayed out of his way; he stayed out of Chris’. He was\r\ndisappointed, some, but glad; Chris probably knew he came on as Mac’s\r\nman. So that was that. No battles. Everybody knew what side they were\r\non. At least Mac and Chris knew. Johnny knew what side he was on, too,\r\nbut it wasn’t what _they_ thought.\r\n\r\n_Turnabout, that’s all_, he thought with silent grim pleasure. _They\r\nused me; now I use them. Let ’em all bleed._...\r\n\r\nTuesday was bad anyhow--bad all day long. If he’d had to stay awake\r\nTuesday night, he didn’t know--\r\n\r\nThe Medic asked him, did he want a sleeping pill. Well, Hell, plenty\r\nof people took sleeping pills. Only now he was wide-awake, rested, and\r\nmuch too clear in the head. _Maybe I should of stood out of bed...?_\r\n\r\n_Ten hours_.... He didn’t know what was going to happen, but he\r\nwas sure of this much: he was _not_ going to drink; and he was\r\n_not_--voluntarily, anyhow--_damn it, not without a fight_--going to\r\nsleep out anything the rest of the passengers could take.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dollars Dome--11_ A.M. (_C.S.T._)\r\n\r\nThey stopped at the office to see if Thad had any news yet. He did; but\r\nnothing special. If there had been any trouble, or anything out of the\r\nway at all, on board the _Messenger_, it was not being broadcast.\r\n\r\n“They probably kept him sedated anyhow,” Phil pointed out, as they\r\ncrossed the Mall to the Med Building where his office was.\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. “No. Not this time.”\r\n\r\n“Oh?” He looked at her curiously. Under his eyes, she lost some of the\r\nquiet certainty with which she had heard both Thad’s report and Phil’s\r\ncomment.\r\n\r\n“I mean, I don’t _think_ so. I--” She flashed a quick smile. “--have a\r\n_hunch_, let’s say.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me more.”\r\n\r\n“I will,” she said soberly. “That’s what I wanted to talk to you about,\r\nPhil.”\r\n\r\nBut she said nothing more till they were in his office. Then she took\r\nout two small rolls of sound tape, and handed them to him.\r\n\r\n“I’d like you to hear these for yourself before I say anything,” she\r\ntold him. “I made them out at the Shack. One was Monday. The other’s\r\nyesterday.”\r\n\r\nHe turned spools over in his hand dubiously.\r\n\r\n“You care to give me any notion of what I’m listening to? Or for?”\r\n\r\n“I thought perhaps you should just _hear_ them first, but--I guess\r\nit’ll make more sense if I tell you this much first. After we talked\r\nabout that--telepathy bit, I got to thinking, and I realized I’d just\r\nbeen _scared_ by the idea. Kind of foolish, I guess.... All this time\r\nI’ve been going around telling people I believe in--or, well, that\r\nI think there’s a lot of sense in some of the work they’ve done in\r\nE.S.P.--Then as soon as something happens to _show me_, I back off and\r\nsay, ‘Oh, no, not for _me_, friend!’” She smiled wryly. Phil grinned.\r\n\r\n“Honey, I told you to start with, this Shack stuff was spooky.\r\nSomething makes sense, that doesn’t necessarily make it _feel\r\nsensible_. I still get shivers when I try to think what they mean by an\r\n‘infinite universe.’ Stuff like that.”\r\n\r\n“Maybe so. Anyhow, I think I’m over--” She stopped herself. “That’s not\r\ntrue. I’m still scared as hell. But I’m scared of having a baby too,\r\nand scared of what might happen tonight, when Johnny comes, and--I’m\r\nscared of lots of things I know are _real_, and even know I’ll get\r\nthrough all right.”\r\n\r\nHe cleared his throat. “Okay, kid. I hope you love me too. Now:--what’s\r\nthe bit with the tapes?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I tried to think how I might be able to find out scientifi--I\r\nguess, _experimentally_ is a better word? Anyhow, I thought if I got\r\na recorder fixed up so that I could talk what I was thinking out\r\nthere--at least _I’d_ find out what I _do_ think there--I told you, I’m\r\nnever positive afterwards just when I got some idea, or just where it\r\n_came_ from--?”\r\n\r\nHe nodded.\r\n\r\n“And then, if it turned out to have anything on it that we could\r\n_check_.... Well, then I’d _know_. Or at least, we’d know there was\r\nsomething worth working on. Well, you know what I mean.”\r\n\r\n“I think so. Just one thing, Lee. You want me to play these, so I\r\ngather you _do_ think there’s something--” He smiled. “--something\r\n‘worth working on?’”\r\n\r\n“I’d rather not say what _I_ think before--”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t ask you to. I told you what _I_ think, right now. It’s just\r\nthat it’s the way you talk about the whole business that makes me\r\nthink so. So I play these tapes, see? And let’s say _I_ think there’s\r\nsomething there--let’s say, at a minimum, something that needs to be\r\nlooked into more?” He paused. “Lee, you’re not forgetting that Johnny’s\r\ncoming? He’ll be here tonight. I don’t know what happens after that.\r\nNeither do you. I just don’t see the news story on why he’s coming. Why\r\nin hell would he come up here for McLafferty if he wouldn’t for you or\r\nChris?”\r\n\r\n“Phil--” She put a hand on his arm, stopping him. “Listen first, will\r\nyou? I’ve heard them. _I know_ there’s _something_ that--well, just\r\nlisten, will you? We’ll talk later. But I haven’t forgotten about\r\nJohnny, _believe_ me. That’s partly why I wanted to give you the\r\ntapes now--_before_ he gets here. And partly why I guess I don’t want\r\nto talk about it _right now_. I can’t decide anything much till he\r\ncomes anyhow. And--well, whatever happens, I’d like to think that--I\r\nmean, let’s say I back out of the whole thing and go home and never\r\nsay bad words like ESP again--_If_ there’s anything in this thing, I\r\nhave a hunch it’s not _me_ especially. I just happen to be the one\r\nit--_happened to_? That’s as good a way as any to put it. So--so shut\r\nup and listen first, will you?”\r\n\r\n“Right.” He put a hand on her shoulder. “One other thing, Lee--while\r\nthe saying’s still good. Don’t forget I made an offer?”\r\n\r\n“I won’t,” she said. She stepped forward quickly inside his arm, kissed\r\nhim, and turned and left. “I’ve got a class for the next hour,” she\r\nsaid at the door. “Then I’ll be in my room till about two or three.\r\nAfter that, I’ll be out at the Shack, if you want to talk to me about\r\nany of the stuff there.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Zeroville--11:15_ A.M. (_C.S.T._)\r\n\r\nThe morning had been all right.\r\n\r\nHe’d never had more than theoretical training on ion drive; there was\r\nno working ship with one when the _Colombo_ took off. Now, roaming on\r\ninvitation between the rocket rooms and control centers, he began to\r\nrealize just what a monumental accomplishment the _Messenger_ was.\r\nIt was one thing to have the figures in your head: thrust and cost,\r\ntonnage, performance, all that. But for John Wendt, at least, nothing\r\nconvinced but performance. The math told you what to expect--what your\r\nchances were. After that, metal and plastic and power, and flesh and\r\nblood and brains made it _work_.\r\n\r\nIf it worked, it was time to believe in it; not until then.\r\n\r\nHe spent the morning acquiring belief in the ion drive. He made a\r\npoint of not thinking ahead. But as the drive shut out, and the great\r\nwheel, shorn of all velocity, slid onto the Zeroville coasting track,\r\nhe had no alternative. Eleven-fifteen. TOA Moon Dome announced for\r\nseven-thirty. Eight hours, fifteen minutes.\r\n\r\nLunch, of course. Then what? There’d be nothing doing in crew quarters,\r\nonce the shuttles left--\r\n\r\n_Sonofabitch!_\r\n\r\nHe wouldn’t be on the wheel; he’d be in the shuttle. In Shuttle Two:\r\nout like a light. With all the other squares.\r\n\r\nAll passengers made the shuttle-leg under sedation. _All passengers_....\r\n\r\nThe speaker overhead came to life: “All passengers please board your\r\nshuttles. Prepare for sedation.”\r\n\r\nJohnny found Basil, and thanked him. “Nice of you to let me hang around\r\nso much,” he said. “I’d have flipped my top sitting it out with the\r\ndamn riders the whole way.”\r\n\r\n“Pleasure, Johnny. I mean it. Hell, it was good to see you again. I\r\ndon’t want to stick my nose where it ain’t wanted, but--like man, if\r\nyou’re gonna be around again--oh, crap, you know what I mean.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks, Bass. Tell you the truth, I don’t know yet myself. But you got\r\nno one to blame but yourself if they kick you out and give _me_ your\r\njob. Hell--I felt so much like crew this trip, I forgot all about the\r\nshuttle-leg, till they hollered just now.” The announcer barked again,\r\nand started “Last call.”\r\n\r\nJohnny took off down the shaft.\r\n\r\nHe had it _made_!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Red Dome--3:50_ A.M. (_S.S.T._) (_2:30_ P.M. _C.S.T._)\r\n\r\n“... helicopter sighted at base of hill 29.3 kilometres N. 17° E. from\r\nPlayfair Crater. Flight reconnaissance fully establishes identity\r\nof vehicle. No indication of presence of pilot, M. Harounian. No\r\nsuperficial evidence of forced landing. Ground search to be conducted\r\npending permission from U.S.A.A. authorities to conduct same within\r\n50-kilometre zone.”\r\n\r\nDr. Chen tapped the stiff paper of the official report thoughtfully on\r\nhis desk. Then he switched on the phone, and asked for the S.U.A.R.\r\nhostel at World Dome.\r\n\r\nThat seemed probably the best way to go about it. Besides which, Dr.\r\nChristensen was not at Dollars Dome, and no second-in-command would\r\nwant to take responsibility for such a decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dollars Dome--4:30_ P.M. (_C.S.T._)\r\n\r\nPhil Kutler sat at his desk, with a dozen sheets of rapidly typed pages\r\nspread out in front of him. He picked up one, glanced at it, put it\r\ndown, picked up another. He shook his head, marveling or disbelieving,\r\nor just dazed: he wasn’t sure which.\r\n\r\nOn each page, he had collected what seemed to be associated bits from\r\nthe two tapes. Now he began stacking sheets, sorting them into two\r\npiles. In one were the “weirdies”: what they _seemed_ to mean was not\r\neven worth thinking about yet, he told himself firmly. The other stack\r\nheld more coherent and familiar bits which, however, seemed probable\r\n“normal” thought ramblings. He picked up the next page:\r\n\r\n“I will come, yes, I come ... I hear you call. I know it is time now\r\nI will leave this place ... come to where love sends the call out ...\r\nI too love, have warmth, I bring my breath with ... come now to know,\r\nlearn, tell, teach, exchange ... come with love to love....”\r\n\r\nThat was from Monday. From the Tuesday tape: “... came to us ... to me\r\n... to us, _me-all_, came seeking, not knowing, almost, not-sure ...\r\ncame with openness, with warm-breathing ... came to find and to speak\r\nand know....”\r\n\r\nHe put it with the others, then took it off. This one was worth at\r\nleast _asking_ about. He knew in advance what the answer would be.\r\nNo one had come to the Dome or the Shack; if they had, the whole\r\nDome would know it. But--it hung together too well. He set it aside,\r\nseparately. The next two went onto the stack. He pulled the remaining\r\npage toward him, and sat staring at it.\r\n\r\n“... each time around it’s closer, bigger ... need a damn microcaliper\r\nto know it but true, it _is_ ... Lisa, Lee, love....”\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t till that bit came out near the end of the Monday tape that\r\nPhil understood why she had waited till today to tell him, or why she\r\nwould not stay while he played them. Damn few things that would really\r\n_embarrass_ Lee--but her own voice talking love-talk to her would be\r\none too much!\r\n\r\n“... To you, just to you ... screw ’em all ... but I dammit I damn I\r\nlove you, you’re too damn good for me but if I still can I’ll get you\r\nback ... round again, bigger, I can’t see the difference, but know ...\r\ntoo damn many things don’t see, don’t have to not-know account of that.\r\nDon’t see you either ... baby, babe, doll, _wait_ ... damn it hurts,\r\nscared, Lee, you know?, damn, I’m _scared_ ... but I’m coming, babe,\r\nhere I come, _wait_!”\r\n\r\nAlso on Monday’s tape: “... bastard, but not so bad. Smart bastard\r\nanyhow ... just for now, though ... up there, he’s the boss ... good\r\nman, Goddammit, you like the guy or not, good man in his job, and he\r\nknows not here, not know ... Mac-go-to-hell, who cares which one? Just\r\nyou kid, the rest of ’em drop dead all I care....”\r\n\r\nThe page was a full one. Tuesday’s sections included mentions of\r\nsomeone named Bass, and a man called Kenny, and something about a\r\npoker game, scraps on a smashed window, subpoena server, a bit about\r\n“Mac”--McLafferty?\r\n\r\nWell, _this_ page at least could be checked. He folded it, tucked it in\r\nhis jacket pocket, and left the office.\r\n\r\nDownstairs, he turned, without quite planning to, in the direction of\r\nthe Ad Building. In the back of his mind was the question of whether to\r\nspeak to Thad about the tapes. He knew he wouldn’t; and with Chris on\r\nhis way back, it didn’t make sense, anyhow. But he was not quite ready\r\nto see Lisa yet, and he very much wanted to talk to _some_one.\r\n\r\nHe’d kill some time with Thad, anyhow.\r\n\r\nBetter that way. His thoughts could work themselves out better on their\r\nown, in their hidden places, than he could do by conscious effort.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dollars Dome--4:45_ P.M. (_C.S.T._)\r\n\r\nThe suave exterior of the U.S. Envoy to World Dome, the Honorable\r\nAndrew Kenneth Gahagan--a diplomat of the old school--appeared sadly\r\nshaken on the phone screen: whether by emotion, bad radio transmission,\r\nor creeping senility, Thad could not tell.\r\n\r\nWhen he heard what the Honorable Gahagan had to say, he ruled out\r\nthe likelihood of poor transmission. The other two choices remained\r\nequally possible, since the biochemist had no way of knowing just\r\n_how_ serious, realistically speaking, a Red “invasion” of territorial\r\nboundaries might be.\r\n\r\n“It can’t wait two-three hours?” he asked. “Dr. Christensen will be\r\nhere at seven, and I think it should be authorized by him personally.”\r\n\r\n“My own feeling in the matter,” said the Honorable Gahagan “is that it\r\nshould be authorized by Mexcity or not at all. I felt obliged, however,\r\nto determine your attitudes before communicating with State on the\r\nmatter.”\r\n\r\nThad felt an almost irrepressible urge to say, _Oh, hell, tell ’em come\r\non over, if they’ll send their bio chief in the party_ ... or perhaps,\r\n_You know, some of the babes there aren’t bad. Tell ’em to shoot us a\r\nphoto and we’ll look for ourselves_ ... or even just, _Oh, foof!_ He\r\nexercised his will power to its fullest extent and said instead:\r\n\r\n“Look, let me buzz you back in five minutes. I’ve got something here I\r\nhave to get out of the way, and then I’ll see what we can do about it.”\r\n\r\nHe switched off and said to Kutler, who had come in sometime during the\r\nconversation, “You get that bit?”\r\n\r\n“Just the tailend.”\r\n\r\n“The Honorable is all worked up because the Reds have asked permission\r\nto conduct a search for the pilot--girl pilot, I might add--of a\r\nhelicopter of theirs that seems to have landed in some kind of\r\ntrouble inside our zone. I wouldn’t’ve thought twice myself, but Old\r\nHorsefeathers has me worried. And maybe with this whole Security\r\ninvestigation bit--”\r\n\r\n“Man, you don’t read the news. It’s sex they’re discovering now, not\r\nSecurity,” Phil interjected.\r\n\r\n“Oh. Well, maybe being as it’s a _girl_ pilot--Got it!” he said\r\nsuddenly. “What do you think of doing it this way? Tell ’em sure, and\r\nwe’ll help. Set it up so any search team is mixed? Then there can’t be\r\nany snooping or anything. What do you think?”\r\n\r\n“Sounds good to me,” Phil said. “It can’t wait till Chris comes, hey?”\r\n\r\n“This babe has been missing about twelve hours, and they don’t know if\r\nshe’s hurt or in shock or anything.”\r\n\r\n“Well, we can’t very well _refuse_ permission then. I guess the mixed\r\nsearch is about the best bet.”\r\n\r\n“Yeah.” He reached for the phone switch, hesitated, picked up a scrap\r\nof paper from the desk. “Do me a favor, will you? Get a few guys to\r\nrun on out to this location right away and look over the plane. That’s\r\nwhere it’s supposed to be. Meantime, I’ll tell Ole Mustachios what\r\nthe score is, and let--Nope. I’ll call Plato _first_, and then tell\r\nGahagan. That way he can’t stall.”\r\n\r\nPhil nodded approvingly, took the paper, and started out. “Hey, Thad,”\r\nhe said first. “Lee’s out at the Shack. Suppose I get the squad to drop\r\nme off there on the way, and bring her back in? You don’t need me for\r\nanything around here?”\r\n\r\n“No. Good idea. Glad you thought of it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dollars Dome--7:30_ P.M. (_C.S.T._)\r\n\r\nWhen he came out of it, Chris was standing next to the couch, watching\r\nhim. He got himself unbuckled, stood up, stretched. Chris watched, and\r\nsaid nothing. Johnny straightened out, felt his feet steady under him,\r\nand took a stance facing the other man, not more a foot away.\r\n\r\n“All right, Johnny, you got here,” Chris said. “_Now_ what?”\r\n\r\n“What I said to start with,” he replied evenly. “I want to see Lisa.\r\nI hear by the newspapers--” _The hell with that crap! He didn’t ask_\r\nwhy....\r\n\r\n“_I_ see by the newscasts,” Chris picked up on it, “That you are here\r\nas a ‘special investigator’ for Mr. McLafferty--whatever _that_ is.”\r\n\r\nJohnny said nothing.\r\n\r\n“Are the newscasts right?”\r\n\r\n“Ask McLafferty.”\r\n\r\n“You’re closer.”\r\n\r\n“Listen, Chris. I came for Lee. You can make it easy or make it tough.\r\nWe used to be friends, so I tell you this once: I came for my girl. You\r\nand Mac can both go to whatever kind of Hell they keep for guys like\r\nyou. And I’ll foul you up as cheerfully as him if you get in my way. I\r\ncame for my girl. The rest of your politicking fornicating foolishness\r\ndoesn’t concern me at all.”\r\n\r\nChris thought it over. “Okay,” he said. “I’ll cooperate with you in\r\nanything Lee wants. Outside of that, I warn you, step out of line just\r\nonce, just by one toe, and--I’m the boss here. That’s all.”\r\n\r\n“Okay. Now where’s my girl?”\r\n\r\n“You know the room. If she’s not there, try Kutler.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dollars Dome--7:50_ P.M. (_C.S.T._)\r\n\r\n“He’s pretty damn busy,” Bourgnese said. “If it’s something I can take\r\ncare of...?”\r\n\r\n“You Number Two boy here?” Johnny demanded.\r\n\r\n“You could put it that way,” the other man said coldly.\r\n\r\n“Okay. I’ll put it that way. Can you authorize me a half-track?”\r\n\r\n“You’re kiddin’!”\r\n\r\n_Well, what in Hell is so special about wanting a car?_ “What are they,\r\nmade out of solid gold or something? Nobody but the Big Cheese can sign\r\n’em out?”\r\n\r\n“Look, before you flip completely, friend, leave me advise you that\r\nthere probably isn’t even a car in the Dome. If they’re not all out\r\nalready, they ought to be. And what makes you so damn eager to get in\r\non it?”\r\n\r\n“In on what? I’m looking for Lisa.”\r\n\r\n“Well, try Kutler if she’s not in her room. He brought her back in--”\r\n\r\n“He’s not here and neither is she.”\r\n\r\n“You _sure_ of that? He went out for her--Hell, it must’ve been\r\nfive-thirty or so--”\r\n\r\n“I’m sure. She’s at the Shack.”\r\n\r\nBourgnese stared at him a moment.\r\n\r\n“You tried the dining room and dance room and all that jazz? I _know_\r\nhe was bringing her right back.”\r\n\r\n“Listen,” Johnny said, straining all his nerves for patience. “They’re\r\nnot here. They’re at the Shack. Hell, I don’t know where _he_ is, and I\r\ndon’t give a damn. But _she’s_ there.”\r\n\r\n“How do you know?”\r\n\r\n“How the Hell do you _think_ I--?” He stopped cold. How _did_ he know?\r\n“They’re _both_ there,” he said, and knew it was true. “I don’t know\r\nwho the hell else is with them, but they’re both there.”\r\n\r\n“Wait a minute,” Bourgnese went to the phone and called the Shack\r\nGuardhouse. “Charlie! Is Miss Trovi still there?”\r\n\r\n“Yeah. Her and the other babe and the Doc. Some half-track dropped him\r\noff couple hours ago. They’re all in there.”\r\n\r\n“Right. Thanks, Charlie.” He switched off and got Lock Supply.\r\n\r\n“Give me the call number on Kutler’s suit.”\r\n\r\n“Hold on. Here it is. Five-nine-cue-six-emm.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks.” He switched off and on again, dialled the helmet radio\r\nnumber. Nothing. “Damn!”\r\n\r\nHe turned back to Johnny. “Okay,” he said, “Let’s go.”\r\n\r\nThey strode rapidly across the Mall to Lock Supply. Bourgnese signed\r\nout suits for both of them.\r\n\r\nJohnny turned to Thad as the other man started away. “Thanks,” he said.\r\n“I don’t know why in Hell you’re doing it. But _thanks_.”\r\n\r\n“No,” Bourgnese said. “I guess you wouldn’t know why.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Shack--8_ P.M.--_Phil Kutler_\r\n\r\nThe two women sat, one at each side of the tank, gazing into it. Lisa’s\r\nvoice droned as the tape wound from spool to spool:\r\n\r\n“... but I-all did not know ... idea of unit-body discrete-person\r\ntoo far back with memory haze ... and not-alike, even when ... but\r\n_when_? how far back? ... so long I had been one-and-all ... recalled\r\nhaze-memory, but too much lost with no-need-to-know ... had to begin,\r\nto learn, fresh, new ... too slow, too slow....”\r\n\r\n“_He’s coming!_”\r\n\r\nThe words cracked like a whiplash in his helmet; he jumped back, out of\r\ntouch, put a hand to his face-plate in reflexive feeling for damage,\r\nthat _snap_ had been so sharply physical.\r\n\r\nThe plate was intact. Of course. He smiled foolishly, leaned toward her\r\nagain; found he had to _force_ himself to retouch helmets. That crack\r\nhad _hurt_.\r\n\r\n“Johnny?” he asked.\r\n\r\nNo answer. Then out of the side of his eye he saw she was nodding her\r\nhead inside the helmet.\r\n\r\n“Can you tell if anyone’s with him?”\r\n\r\nPause. “Somebody, yes ... not Chris ... Thad?”\r\n\r\nThat seemed likely.\r\n\r\n“How is he--What kind of a mood--? I mean Johnny.”\r\n\r\nShe giggled. “_Fierce!_”\r\n\r\n_Great!_ But _she_ didn’t sound worried. “That’s good?” he asked sourly.\r\n\r\n“Depends....”\r\n\r\nHe backed off to look at her. The half-smile on her face was--in\r\nMoonsuit and helmet, in a half-enclosed shack on the Moon’s friendless\r\nface--absurd, ludicrous ... nothing short of outrageously funny with\r\nits eternal-mysterious-female. _So laugh already!_ He didn’t. _Sure_,\r\nhe thought, _funny, like ... crazy, man ... but how would it look if\r\nshe smiled it for you?_ Then he realized she could probably hear _this_\r\nas well--or more clearly than?--anything he said aloud through the\r\nhelmets. And then, with relief, but with bitterness too: _If she were\r\nlistening, that is_....\r\n\r\nShe wasn’t. She was listening only to one man, the man at the wheel\r\nof the half-track, now visibly nearing at full speed across the Moon\r\ndustcakes--coming for her.\r\n\r\nAnd the half-smile was gone. A full, lovely smile now, and moist eyes\r\ntoo. _What the hell is he saying?_\r\n\r\n_None of your damn business!_\r\n\r\nHe started again. It was going to take getting used to: getting to know\r\nwhen you had thought a thing for yourself, or had it thought _to_ you.\r\nThat one was himself--he thought.\r\n\r\nHe leaned forward again. “Does Maria know?”\r\n\r\n“Of _course_. We were just thinking....” Then it happened again: a\r\nsort of stereo-thought in his mind, coming from both, complete,\r\nin-agreement, and did-he-agree? Was this the best way?\r\n\r\nHe nodded, straightened up, and walked through the door to wait outside.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Shack--8_ P.M.--_Thad Bourgnese_\r\n\r\n“It ought to be Phil,” he said tensely. “I’ll try him again.” This time\r\nthe reply was immediate; nothing wrong with Doc’s suit then; he’d just\r\nbeen switched off before.\r\n\r\n_Switched off?_ The guy goes out to get Lisa, stays out himself\r\ninstead, and turns off his set. _Nice going_....\r\n\r\n“Hi,” Phil said. “Johnny with you?”\r\n\r\n“Yeah. What in hell are you doing out here? _And where’s Lee?_”\r\n\r\n“Right inside. Waiting. Also, we have a guest.”\r\n\r\n“_Guest?_” If that meant what he thought it did, this was one too much.\r\n“Who’s the guest?”\r\n\r\n“I hate to shout,” Phil said. “You dig me, man!”\r\n\r\n_Yeah? I do, do I? Then what in the name of all-holy have you been\r\nsitting out here for? The whole damn Dome goes out hunting, and_....\r\n\r\nThe half-track ground to a screeching halt. Wendt was out almost before\r\nit stopped. Thad turned off the ignition and followed. He saw Johnny’s\r\ntaller figure march like incarnate doom on the man at the door.\r\n\r\n“For krissakes, Phil,” he started, and would have said, _Let him in!_\r\nbut it was unnecessary. Kutler had moved before Wendt got there. Johnny\r\nwent through, and Phil stepped back in front of the door.\r\n\r\nThad walked up slowly. He was trying hard to hold onto the irritation\r\nhe _knew_ he should still feel.\r\n\r\n“What gives?” he asked, and managed a frown.\r\n\r\n“Lee said, just Johnny, first, please. That’s all.”\r\n\r\n“_Just?_ What’s with your company?”\r\n\r\n“She’ll be out.” Kutler’s calm ought to be infuriating. But all he felt\r\nwas: _Well, Phil’s got some sense; he must know what he’s doing_....\r\n\r\n“You wouldn’t mind filling me in some?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Glad to. Turn off your radio. I don’t want to tell the whole world.”\r\n\r\nThe two men touched helmets, and Phil started talking. A moment later,\r\na bulky figure in an ill-fitting, clearly-marked, S.U.A.R. suit\r\ncame out of the Shack. The three of them headed for the pressurized\r\nGuardhouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Shack--8_ P.M.--_Johnny Wendt_\r\n\r\nHe stepped through the doorway into dimness and a kind of--_warmth?_\r\nIn the center of the pavilion--that’s all it really was--a tank set on\r\nthe ground bubbled evilly around an enormous hump of moldy grey-white,\r\nkneaded-looking, knobbed, and ridged.\r\n\r\nTwo suited figures sat, one on each side of the tank. As he entered,\r\nthe one at the far end arose, walked around the tank, came toward him.\r\n\r\n_Lee?_\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t, of course. He would have known by her walk, and when she\r\ncame close enough, by her face.... But before he saw these things at\r\nall, he _knew_ it wasn’t. Lee sat with her back to him. The other\r\nwoman--_Maria?_--smiled as she passed, and went out.\r\n\r\nLee sat where she was, back to him. But--\r\n\r\n_Johnny, oh Johnny, my darling, my love!_\r\n\r\nIt was not in words. The thought of the words, the idea of speaking,\r\nwas there; and it seemed that he heard: but what was most real about\r\nit came through without symbols, and surely without any sounds. It was\r\njust--\r\n\r\n_Warmth. Lisa-to-Johnny-warmth. Love._\r\n\r\nNothing to question or worry or doubt or solicit or yearn for or want\r\nor need or define. Just love-as-is ... love-actuality ... love-known,\r\nlove-before, love-after ... a place to rest and be warm through inside\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nHe had felt it before.\r\n\r\nHe had felt it and it had been false.\r\n\r\nHe had felt it, not Lisa-to-Johnny, but--\r\n\r\n_No!_\r\n\r\nIf he screamed aloud, nobody knew it. _He_ didn’t know. His head ached,\r\neither from the resounding scream inside the helmet, or else from the\r\nneed to scream, kept in his head.\r\n\r\n_Doug, get out! Get out, damn it! Get out of here! Damn it, you’re\r\ndead! Don’t you know you’re dead?_\r\n\r\nThe figure at the tank rose, and began to turn.\r\n\r\nJohnny stood helpless, rooted. He would have fled if he could. But the\r\nwarm flood embraced him, caressed him, held him bound. Frightening,\r\nenticing, beckoning, threatening, stiflingly suffocating, vibrantly\r\nlife-giving. And--\r\n\r\nHe had run from it before. He could run no more.\r\n\r\nThe figure turned toward him entirely, and stepped forward.\r\n\r\nIt was not Doug. Doug was dead.\r\n\r\nIt was Lee. _Lee, Lisa, Lisa-love, Lisa-loves-John_....\r\n\r\n_Her_ walk.... _Her_ love.... _Her_ face, smiling up at him, close and\r\ncloser still, through the plastic helmet plate, tearfully?, lovingly,\r\n_hers_.\r\n\r\n_Lee!_\r\n\r\nHe reached out his arms.\r\n\r\nShe came into them--almost. His gauntletted hands gripped the backs of\r\nher shoulders, and she looked up, laughing. The rigid fabric of his\r\nsuit was pressed against hers, and there they stood, each one behind\r\nhis own life-saving column of air inside the pressured suits, in a mad\r\ncaricature of embrace. Laughter broke loose inside him and bubbled\r\nup. He bent his head; helmets touched; and their laughing mingled and\r\nmerged and grew whole. It raced into the current of love-warmth, and\r\npulled him with it, turning and twisting and sporting in cascading\r\ntorrents of lovely-Lisa-laughs-with-love....\r\n\r\nHow long they stood there in the wondrous half-embrace he did not know:\r\ntwo enclosed islands inside their Moonsuits, making love through glass\r\nwalls by the side of a strange pool of--\r\n\r\nHe shuddered.\r\n\r\n--of bubbling putrescence, of--\r\n\r\n_A friend!_ she said sharply.\r\n\r\n_Friend!?_ He looked at the tank and he shuddered again. Looked back\r\nat his Lisa. “Hey, babe,” he said gently, his helmet against hers, “I\r\nthink we better get you--”\r\n\r\n_Not yet!_ She smiled. But she hadn’t waited to hear what he said. And\r\nshe hadn’t opened her mouth when she spoke.\r\n\r\nNor had he--the first time.\r\n\r\n_You know it’s true, darling_....\r\n\r\nHer voice, yes, but voiceless.... Their helmets now were clear inches\r\napart. _Listen! she insisted._\r\n\r\n_Monday afternoon_, she told him, reciting, _you sat in the Messenger\r\ndining room and watched the Moon, and you thought you could see it\r\nget bigger and bigger each time it went around, if you could have\r\nmicrocalipers to measure with_....\r\n\r\n_This morning, you watched every step of the ion blast_....\r\n\r\n_Yesterday_....\r\n\r\nIt went on and on. It battered, without hurt; pushed, without tearing;\r\nforced itself into his consciousness tenderly, gently, inexorably. It\r\n_was_ true. It _worked_.\r\n\r\nLike the ion engine--like anything--_it worked_! He saw it work, felt\r\nit work, _knew_ it worked. So it was true.\r\n\r\n_Why?_\r\n\r\n_How?_\r\n\r\n_I’ll show you, darling_.... He let her draw him back to the tank, and\r\nsat down beside her.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Shack--8_ P.M.--_In the Guardhouse_\r\n\r\n“You are Maria Harounian?” Bourgnese asked sternly.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“You speak English?”\r\n\r\n“Only few words.”\r\n\r\n“You are from Red Dome--from the S.U.A.R. Dome?”\r\n\r\nShe nodded.\r\n\r\nHe turned to Kutler.\r\n\r\n“How long has she been with you in there?”\r\n\r\n“She was there when I got there; two hours, maybe? I don’t know if you\r\nnoticed, Thad. She’s--quite pregnant. You might ask her to sit.”\r\n\r\n“All right. Would you like to sit down, Maria?”\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. “No-thank.” She smiled. When she smiled, her wide\r\nblonde face looked remarkably like Lisa Trovi’s long dark-skinned face.\r\n\r\n“You saw her enter the Shack?”\r\n\r\nSome shuffling of feet. “Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n“And you permitted her to enter?”\r\n\r\n“Well, yessir. Miss Trovi said--”\r\n\r\n“You did not see fit to inform us in Dome?”\r\n\r\n“Sir, Miss Trovi said this lady was with _her_. She took all\r\nresponsibility.”\r\n\r\n“But you knew a search was being conducted for Miss Harounian?”\r\n\r\n“Well, yes, but we didn’t know it was _her_. Miss Trovi came to the\r\ndoor, and said, her and her friend going in to the Shack, let ’em know\r\nif anyone tries to call....”\r\n\r\n“You didn’t ask who her ‘friend’ was?” Thad shook his head,\r\nincredulous. These men were _good_ guards. They knew their job.\r\n\r\n“Well, no sir.”\r\n\r\n“Sir--”\r\n\r\nIt was the Russian girl. “Yes?”\r\n\r\n“Sir--she want us. Calling now.”\r\n\r\nThere was an odd sort of urgency in her voice, in her face, her whole\r\nstance.\r\n\r\n“Right!” The three of them started back to the Shack, with just one\r\nsmall part of Thad’s mind still wondering why neither he nor the guards\r\nhad called Chris yet.\r\n\r\nInside the Shack, Lisa waited, with Johnny beside her. She smiled\r\na welcome to the Soviet girl; included the two men afterwards. She\r\nbeckoned Phil. “Start the tape? I’ll try to keep talking it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mars--April, 1975--Doug Laughlin_\r\n\r\nThe Earthman stood beneath a violet sky, on rusty sands, and turned,\r\ninch by inch, slowly, feeling with all his ... something he had no word\r\nfor ... exactly as at home he might have felt with a moist finger for\r\nthe source of wind.\r\n\r\nHe made three complete turns before he stopped. He nodded, satisfied.\r\nThat was the way. It didn’t change. The tenth time in four days now,\r\nand always the same.\r\n\r\nHe went into the ship, and entered the direction in the Log.\r\n\r\nThe brother-Earthman slept. The first one sat at the big book and\r\nwrote. He covered two pages, and went back and read them through,\r\nnodding. Then went back to what he had written before, and read that.\r\nHe nodded again.\r\n\r\nHe closed the book, and sat thinking. Then he stood up and went to the\r\nbunk where the brother-Earthman slept. He reached out a hand and drew\r\nit back again. Reached out and drew back. As if a wall stood between\r\nthem. It seemed like a wall: from the brother-Earthman there was a sort\r\nof cloud of _No--Don’t touch!_\r\n\r\nHe backed off from the bunk, somewhat sadly. Got into his heat suit and\r\nmask. Went down to the cargo hatch. Checked out a sand-cat. Started it\r\nup. Stood out on the sands while the motor warmed in the dawn chill.\r\nMade his inching turns again: nodded, deeply satisfied, _certain_ now.\r\n\r\nIn his mind, he went back inside to the brother-Earthman, walled in his\r\nbunk with sleep and _No_. Stood there, thinking, and went back inside\r\nand to the Log. Looked through the pages, four of them on which he had\r\nwritten what at last he believed, what he was going to find out for\r\nsure.\r\n\r\nWanted to leave what he said, but not leave information to follow with.\r\nIf he was mad, let one death be enough. Four pages, two sheets, and\r\neach sheet somewhere on it had the destination. He thought:--\r\n\r\nIf he was right, explanations would follow. If he were wrong--what\r\ndifference _why_?\r\n\r\nHe tore out the sheets. Left the ship. Started out, to find the\r\nMars-people whose love-thoughts, greetings, warm yearnings and welcomes\r\ncame like a wind, like a breeze, like a flood of light, beam of\r\ncaresses, from a direction he now knew he knew....\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mars--April, 1975--Martian_\r\n\r\n_I-all waited, eager, sending out callings: joyous, rejoicing,\r\npreparing reception; calling in airmakers, calling in watercells,\r\ncalling in; calling for the Earthman coming_....\r\n\r\n... _I-all, a planet-wide oneness of readying: for new exchange,\r\nlearning, contact, emotion, give-and-take, take-and-give;\r\nfrom/to/with/alongside/between/together with this unit-body of Earthman\r\napproaching_....\r\n\r\n... _I-all, ready now, knowing from last time, from\r\nEarth-other-brothers who came in first great ship, knowing ahead this\r\ntime: air, water vapor--without these the Earth-bodies cannot survive;\r\nold memories stirring, from before me-all, once on a time when the\r\nI-we who lived before me-all were discrete bodies alive in a fluid of\r\nwater-air; back, distant-far back before the drying and thinning of\r\natmosphere_....\r\n\r\n... _I-all, descended, evolved, changed, mutated, attenuated, substance\r\nof sentience: broken to one-cells; joined in one-thinkingness;\r\nstretched out to use all the sparse vapors spread round a planet;\r\ncombined, united, one-minded but many-celled--starch-makers,\r\nwater-bags, air-holders, carriers, sun-suckers, thought-senders,\r\nsoil-savers, moss-tenders, all of the others, all of the kinds of\r\nme-us, one-cell and one-cell; and here in the dim place of safehold,\r\nthe grouped one-cells, planners and thoughtmakers fed, watered, warmed,\r\nby my-our other-I’s, sending out callings for feeders, airers, for\r\nheaters, waterers, all to send extras with carriers to the vault, to\r\ntend the Earth-brother_....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDoug would have been all right, except that he misjudged the distance.\r\nIf he had realized he’d have to go all the way to the old city to reach\r\nIt-Them, he would have done the whole thing differently. He’d have\r\ntold Wendt where he meant to go--if not why--and taken a heli. If he\r\nrealized, he would have lived.\r\n\r\nIf _They-It_ had realized--if the two Russians had come to It-Them\r\nsooner after the crash, had lived a bit longer to tell more and learn\r\nmore, if They-It had been able to learn from the first two that for\r\nEarth-bodies the life of the brain alone is not sufficient--If It-They\r\nhad understood the whole human mechanism, perhaps he’d have lived.\r\n\r\nWhether the Martian (call it that; call it “it”, there is no\r\nproper pronoun) could have summoned resources sufficient to keep\r\nDoug alive--for years, as it would have been--until help came, the\r\nMoon-Martian did not know. But the Martian had too little information\r\nto plan ahead, and it took planning.\r\n\r\nIt _could_ have stopped him; _would_ have, had it known his supplies\r\nwould run out before he reached the vault, or that its own preparations\r\nwere foolishly inadequate. But the centuries--aeons? millennia?\r\nHow long, Moon-Martian also did not know--of one-ness, alone in\r\ntogetherness with all just oneself, the long-long loneliness had only\r\nbeen outlined, sharp-edged, and identified, when the two Russians came\r\nfor so short a time.\r\n\r\nLaughlin came closer, and it sent its call stronger and clearer, more\r\nendearing. Laughlin’s cat sputtered and failed, and without thinking,\r\nhe strapped the spare oxy tank on his back and set out afoot.\r\n\r\nHe lived ten days inside the vault beneath what he and Johnny had\r\ndecided must have been a Martian bank, but had been built especially to\r\nguard, preserve, tend, grow, the brain-centre of the planet-wide “body”\r\nof the last Martian--the brain into which was poured the memory and\r\nknowledge, skill and affections and hopes and dreams and lost beliefs\r\nand yearnings and ideals of a race which could not in its own first\r\nform survive the stripping of the atmosphere from the old planet.\r\n\r\nHe lived, intact, ten days; his brain, for which there was enough\r\nstarch, air, and water, stayed alive and able to communicate--how\r\nlong?--Moon-Martian did not know--a long time, too-long, till he was\r\nsure the Martian knew _enough_ now for the next Earthmen; then he chose\r\nnot-to-live.\r\n\r\nIt was his choice to make. The Martian did not like it, but complied;\r\nit had no choice.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, October 19, 1977, 10:15_ P.M. (_C.S.T._)\r\n\r\nThe two bulky figures entered the half-track, and the taller one sealed\r\nthe door behind them.\r\n\r\nWhen he turned back to her, the woman had already opened the car’s oxy\r\nvalve, and removed her helmet.\r\n\r\nWithout taking his eyes from her face, he reached up and undid the\r\nclasps on his, broke the gasket seal, and lifted the bowl off his head.\r\nHe stepped forward, and she took one step at the same time, meeting\r\nhim. For the first time in two months, they met each other’s lips.\r\n\r\nHe stripped off his gauntlets, and held her head in his hands, drinking\r\nin the touch and look and scent and feel of her. From the neck down,\r\nthe limp pressure suits swathed them both in formless fabric armor; but\r\nhands and heads were free to caress; a smile could be finger-traced as\r\nwell as seen; a murmured word was clear to a close ear.\r\n\r\nFor minutes, they stood close as the cloth barriers would let them be,\r\nnot thinking anything, not saying anything in words that mattered.\r\nThen, still without words, he started the car, and they sat together,\r\nhis arm around her, her head on his chest, for all the world like two\r\nwistful teenagers, while the ’track chugged torpidly back over the\r\nblack face of the old Moon, under the gleaming greenfaced glow of Earth.\r\n\r\nPerhaps half way back, the words began. And then they tumbled out,\r\nquestions on both sides coming so eagerly that nothing could really\r\nstart to be answered.\r\n\r\nIt was a curious double-level conversation, too: because while\r\ntheir spoken words explored the wide new world opened up by the\r\nevents at the Shack, the unspoken dialogue between them continued to\r\nre-enforce itself, and re-create their private world of love and close\r\ncommunication. The contact, once made, seemed quite able to function on\r\nits own, independent of the--\r\n\r\n--_whatever-it-was?_ Lisa, in snatches, told Johnny as much as she had\r\nbeen able to figure out, with Thad’s help and Phil’s, about the growth\r\nand differentiation of the Mars-bugs. The bubbling vat was a sort of\r\nbrain-center. It extended nerve-like networks to all other colonies\r\nof bugs. Here on the Moon, where zealous “jailors” fed and tended the\r\n“brain,” the network was just a sort of habit; on Mars, it served the\r\nvital function of connecting the water-holders, the oxygen-makers,\r\nthe perceptors and proprioceptors and nutriment-synthesizers. The\r\nadaptation-or-mutation puzzler which had first caught the attention of\r\nthe Dome scientists was not too different in nature from the sort of\r\n“instinctive” decision that sets the sex and functions of each new-made\r\negg in an ant colony. All genes for each caste are present at birth;\r\nthe environment of the particular cell determines the final role of the\r\nmember. And the choice of environment for that cell? With a functioning\r\nconscious brain, it was much easier to understand in the--Martian?\r\nMoon-Martian? _The friend_, was the way Lee thought of it--than it was\r\nin an ant colony.\r\n\r\nShe was telling him how Phil had forced her to recognize and experiment\r\nwith the _psi_ effects, when the call came. It came on the radio--but\r\nthat was one minute after they had reversed direction, and started back\r\ntoward the other half-track. It came first in Lee’s awareness.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of a sentence, she broke off, and at the same instant, in\r\nthe wordless sentence of love she was “speaking”, she stopped to say,\r\n_They’re out of gas_.\r\n\r\nLater, John realized that if she’d said it aloud, he _still_ would have\r\ndoubted. But in the inner dialogue there was no space for doubt or\r\ndisbelief. He heard it, knew it, and acted on it, long seconds before\r\nthey had switched on and warmed up their radio set, to call for help.\r\n\r\nAnd by that time, he’d had the next thought.\r\n\r\nHe told Bourgnese, on the radio, that they were on their way, and asked\r\nthem to stay tuned in. Then he switched off and started to ask Lee if\r\nshe would try something--then knew she already knew, and before he\r\ncould tell her exactly what it was he wanted, felt the opening channel\r\nbetween his own mind and the--_friend_--and switched on the set again.\r\n\r\n“Bourgnese?”\r\n\r\n“Right here.”\r\n\r\n“Listen, this might be just for laughs, but give your buggy a try\r\nagain, will you?”\r\n\r\n“Tonight I’ll try anything, man,” Thad said, and then, “She won’t\r\ncatch, John. We’re bone dry.”\r\n\r\n“Forget the starter. Listen--just get in gear and _drive_. I mean--damn\r\nit, this sounds nuts. _Pretend_ you’ve got gas. Like, try it once,\r\nokay?”\r\n\r\n“What can I lose?”\r\n\r\nA moment’s wait, and an exclamation--hardly more than a _whoosh_\r\nof air, but it contained all the bafflement, delight, suspicion,\r\nexcitement, and fascination that gave them the answer. Then, very\r\ncalmly: “Nice going, John. We’ll make it back, I guess.”\r\n\r\nThe new world of collaboration had started.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEPILOGUE\r\n\r\n  _Dollars Dome, Thursday,\r\n  October 20, 1977--2:30 A.M. (C.S.T.)_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the conference room, Dr. Christensen sat at one end of the table;\r\nDr. Chen sat at the other. Down one side of the table were ranged the\r\nU.S.A.A. staff, including Trovi, Kutler, Wendt, Bourgnese. Down the\r\nother side were S.U.A.R. men in equal numbers--and Harounian.\r\n\r\nThe last of the tapes slid to an end, and turned itself off. There was\r\nsilence. Then Kutler rose and started to speak.\r\n\r\nHe explained in detail what he knew of the development of Lisa Trovi’s\r\nability.\r\n\r\nHe sat down, and the Soviet’s Gregoriev rose, and told a rather more\r\nmethodical and experimental tale of the discovery of Maria Harounian’s\r\ntalent. “We came to the conclusion, tentative, that the pregnancy might\r\nbe a factor,” he finished. “It now seems this is justified.”\r\n\r\nLisa whispered to Phil. He rose again. “Miss Trovi suggests that the\r\nparticular pregnancy that was operative was hers--only because the\r\nchild carried genes familiar to the--the Martian. She understands that\r\nit might be possible for a mind which has not yet developed semantic\r\ncenters to--receive?--more readily. Thus, she believes her unborn child\r\nand Miss Harounian’s might have been in contact more easily than two\r\nadults.”\r\n\r\nThe first stir of reaction across the table subsided; there were nods\r\nof slow agreement.\r\n\r\nBourgnese rose: “Begging the pardon of the two ladies,” he said, “I’d\r\nlike to call attention to another matter. It happens these two infants\r\nwere conceived prior to a certain--ah, noticeable change in--well, I’m\r\nsure you gentlemen have all been aware of the furor in our press about\r\nour--ah, _morals_, here? Of course, we don’t know how things are at\r\nyour Dome, but--?” He stood a moment, grinned, found two, then three\r\nand four answering grins across the table. “My suggestion was that\r\nperhaps the--emanations? _callings?_--from the--Martian--might have\r\nbeen in part responsible for--shall we say?--an extraordinary goodwill\r\nin the two Domes blessed with--Martian extensions?”\r\n\r\nAs he sat down, one of the Chinese delegates leaned forward. “I was\r\njust thinking,” he said, without bothering to rise, “I wonder how good\r\nthis Martian is at PK?”\r\n\r\nThe words raced round the table, with the thought right behind. In a\r\nmoment, a babble of voices was following. After a short time, John\r\nWendt stood up.\r\n\r\nThe room quieted slowly. Slowly, and with precision, he told the story\r\nof the fuelless half-track.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” he said. “It appears that we may have at hand a fuel--if\r\nyou call it that--which will make any kind of space travel more\r\npractical. Excuse me; I am doing my best to understate. Assuming\r\nthis--fuel--does not exist, we now know--” He swallowed, opened his\r\nmouth, cleared his throat. “Oh Hell. What I’m trying to say is: I’d\r\nlike to volunteer three of the crew for the next trip out--anywhere.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                              --THE END--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s Note:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Obvious errors have been silently corrected in this version, but\r\nminor inconsistencies have been retained as printed.\r\n\r\n  Dates corrected as follows:\r\n  page 106: Aug. 23. to Sep. 6.\r\n  page 106: Aug. 21. to Sep. 4.",
