But have you\r\n  heard of Planetary Survey? Here’s the real truth about it. Everest\r\n  has been climbed twice.=\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1952 they were about ready to give up trying to climb Mt. Everest.\r\nIt was the photographs that kept them going.\r\n\r\nAs photographs go, they weren’t much; fuzzy, streaked and with just\r\ndark blobs against the white to be interested in. But those dark blobs\r\nwere living creatures. The men swore to it.\r\n\r\nI said, “What the hell, they’ve been talking about creatures skidding\r\nalong the Everest glaciers for forty years. It’s about time we did\r\nsomething about it.”\r\n\r\nJimmy Robbons (pardon me, James Abram Robbons) was the one who pushed\r\nme into that position. He was always nuts on mountain climbing, you\r\nsee. He was the one who knew all about how the Tibetans wouldn’t go\r\nnear Everest because it was the mountain of the gods, he could quote\r\nme every mysterious manlike footprint ever reported in the ice 25,000\r\nfeet up, he knew by heart every tall story about the spindly white\r\ncreatures, speeding along the crags just over the last heart-breaking\r\ncamp which the climbers had managed to establish.\r\n\r\nIt’s good to have one enthusiastic creature of the sort at Planetary\r\nSurvey headquarters.\r\n\r\nThe last photographs put bite into his words, though. After all, you\r\n_might_ just barely think they were men.\r\n\r\nJimmy said, “Look, boss, the point isn’t that they’re there, the point\r\nis that they move fast. Look at that figure. It’s blurred.”\r\n\r\n“The camera might have moved.”\r\n\r\n“The crag here is sharp enough. And the men swear it was running.\r\nImagine the metabolism it must have to run at that oxygen pressure.\r\nLook, boss, would you have believed in deep-sea fish if you’d never\r\nheard of them? You have fish which are looking for new niches in\r\nenvironment which they can exploit, so they go deeper and deeper into\r\nthe abyss until one day they find they can’t return. They’ve adapted so\r\nthoroughly they can live only under tons of pressure.”\r\n\r\n“Well-”\r\n\r\n“Damn it, can’t you reverse the picture? Creatures can be forced up a\r\nmountain can’t they? They can learn to stick it out in thinner air and\r\ncolder temperatures. They can live on moss or on occasional birds, just\r\nas the deep-sea fish in the last analysis live on the upper fauna that\r\nslowly go filtering down. Then, someday, they find they can’t go down\r\nagain. I don’t even say they’re men. They can be chamois or mountain\r\ngoats or badgers or anything.”\r\n\r\nI said stubbornly, “The witnesses said they were vaguely manlike, and\r\nthe reported footprints are certainly manlike.”\r\n\r\n“Or bearlike,” said Jimmy. “You can’t tell.”\r\n\r\nSo that’s when I said, “It’s about time we did something about it.”\r\n\r\nJimmy shrugged and said, “They’ve been trying to climb Mt. Everest for\r\nforty years.” And he shook his head.\r\n\r\n“For gossake,” I said. “All you mountain climbers are nuts. That’s\r\nfor sure. You’re not interested in getting to the top. You’re just\r\ninterested in getting to the top in a certain way. It’s about time\r\nwe stopped fooling around with picks, ropes, camps and all the\r\nparaphernalia of the Gentlemen’s Club that sends suckers up the slopes\r\nevery five years or so.”\r\n\r\n“What are you getting at?”\r\n\r\n“They invented the airplane in 1903, you know?”\r\n\r\n“You mean fly over Mt. Everest!” He said it the way an English lord\r\nwould say “Shoot a fox!” or an angler would say, “Use worms!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I said, “fly over Mt. Everest and let someone down on the top.\r\nWhy not?”\r\n\r\n“He won’t live long. The fellow you let down, I mean.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?” I asked again. “You drop supplies and oxygen tanks, and the\r\nfellow wears a spacesuit. Naturally.”\r\n\r\nIt took time to get the Air Force to listen and to agree to send a\r\nplane and by that time Jimmy Robbons had swivelled his mind to the\r\npoint where he volunteered to be the one to land on Everest’s peak.\r\n“After all,” he said in half a whisper, “I’d be the first man ever to\r\nstand there.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat’s the beginning of the story. The story itself can be told very\r\nsimply, and in far fewer words.\r\n\r\nThe plane waited two weeks during the best part of the year (as far as\r\nEverest was concerned, that is) for a siege of only moderately nasty\r\nflying weather, then took off.\r\n\r\nThey made it. The pilot reported by radio to a listening group exactly\r\nwhat the top of Mt. Everest looked like when seen from above and then\r\nhe described exactly how Jimmy Robbons looked as his parachute got\r\nsmaller and smaller.\r\n\r\nThen another blizzard broke and the plane barely made it back to base\r\nand it was another two weeks before the weather was bearable again.\r\n\r\nAnd all that time Jimmy was on the roof of the world by himself and I\r\nhated myself for a murderer.\r\n\r\nThe plane went back up two weeks later to see if they could spot his\r\nbody. I don’t know what good it would have done if they had, but that’s\r\nthe human race for you. How many dead in the last war? Who can count\r\nthat high? But money or anything else is no object to the saving of one\r\nlife, or even the recovering of one body.\r\n\r\nThey didn’t find his body, but they did find a smoke signal; curling up\r\nin the thin air and whipping away in the gusts. They let down a grapple\r\nand Jimmy came up, still in his spacesuit, looking like hell, but\r\ndefinitely alive.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe p.s. to the story involves my visit to the hospital last week to\r\nsee him. He was recovering very slowly. The doctors said shock, they\r\nsaid exhaustion, but Jimmy’s eyes said a lot more.\r\n\r\nI said. “How about it, Jimmy, you haven’t talked to the reporters, you\r\nhaven’t talked to the government. All right. How about talking to me?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve got nothing to say,” he whispered.\r\n\r\n“Sure you have,” I said. “You lived on top of Mt. Everest during a\r\ntwo-week blizzard. You didn’t do that by yourself, not with all the\r\nsupplies we dumped along with you. Who helped you, Jimmie boy?”\r\n\r\nI guess he knew there was no use trying to bluff. Or maybe he was\r\nanxious to get it off his mind. He said, “They’re intelligent, boss.\r\nThey compressed air for me. They set up a little power pack to keep\r\nme warm. They set up the smoke signal when they spotted the airplane\r\ncoming back.”\r\n\r\n“I see.” I didn’t want to rush him. “It’s like we thought. They’re\r\nadapted to Everest life. They can’t come down the slopes.”\r\n\r\n“No, they can’t. And we can’t go up the slopes. Even if the weather\r\ndidn’t stop us, they would!”\r\n\r\n“They sound like kindly creatures, so why should they object? They\r\nhelped _you_.”\r\n\r\n“They have nothing against us. They spoke to me, you know. Telepathy.”\r\n\r\nI frowned. “Well, then.”\r\n\r\n“But they don’t intend to be interfered with. They’re watching us,\r\nboss. They’ve got to. We’ve got atomic power. We’re about to have\r\nrocket ships. They’re worried about us. And Everest is the only place\r\nthey can watch us from!”\r\n\r\nI frowned deeper. He was sweating and his hands were shaking.\r\n\r\nI said, “Easy, boy. Take it easy. What on Earth are these creatures?”\r\n\r\nAnd he said, “What do you suppose would be so adapted to thin air and\r\nsubzero cold that Everest would be the only livable place on Earth to\r\nthem? That’s the whole point. They’re nothing at all on Earth. They’re\r\nMartians.”\r\n\r\nAnd that’s it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s Note:\r\n\r\n\r\nThis etext was produced from Universe Science Fiction, December 1953.\r\n\r\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright\r\non this publication was renewed.\r\n\r\nObvious errors in punctuation have been silently corrected in this\r\nversion.",
