Advertisements\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn modern times the tendency of the inhabitants of a country to dwell\r\ntogether in large communities, and the consequent need for accumulating\r\nin a particular locality a sufficient supply of water for household,\r\nsocial, and industrial purposes, have rendered necessary the\r\nconstruction of such engineering works as impounding reservoirs and\r\nwells, by means of which the abundant measure of sparsely populated\r\ndistricts may be utilized, and water obtained not only free from those\r\nimpurities which it collects in densely populated districts, but also in\r\ngreater quantity than the natural sources of the district are capable of\r\nsupplying.\r\n\r\nOf the works mentioned, wells have fairly a primary claim upon the\r\nnotice of the sanitary engineer, for, without undervaluing other sources\r\nof supply, the water from them certainly possesses the advantage over\r\nthat from rivers and surface drainage, of being without organic\r\nadmixture and unimpregnated with those deadly spores which find their\r\nway into surface waters and are so fatal in seasons of epidemic\r\nvisitation. A great deal of the irregularity in the action of wells, and\r\nthe consequent distrust with which they are regarded by many, is\r\nattributable either to improper situation or to the haphazard manner in\r\nwhich the search for underground water is frequently conducted. As\r\nregards the first cause, it cannot be too strongly stated that extreme\r\ncaution is necessary in the choice of situations for wells, and that a\r\nsound geological knowledge of the country in which the attempt is to be\r\nmade should precede any sinking or boring for this purpose, otherwise\r\nmuch useless expense may be incurred without a chance of success.\r\nIndeed, the power of indicating those points where wells may, in all\r\nprobability, be successfully established, is one of the chief practical\r\napplications of geology to the useful purposes of life.\r\n\r\nTwo cases in point are before me as I write; in the one 15,000_l._ has\r\nbeen spent in sinking a shaft and driving headings which yield but\r\nlittle water, found abundantly at the same depth in a mine adjoining;\r\nand in the other a town would be, but for its surface wells, entirely\r\nwithout water, the waterworks having been idle for weeks, and the\r\nsinkers are feebly endeavouring to obtain water by deep sinkings, in a\r\nposition where its occurrence in any quantity is physically impossible.\r\nAmple supplies could be obtained in both these cases by shifting the\r\nsituation a few hundred yards.\r\n\r\nThe subject-matter of the following pages is divided into chapters which\r\ntreat of geological considerations, the new red sandstone, well sinking,\r\nwell boring, the American tube well, well boring at great depths, and\r\nexamples of wells executed and of localities supplied respectively, with\r\ntables and miscellaneous information. Each system with its adjuncts has\r\nbeen kept complete in itself, instead of separating the various tools\r\nand appliances into classes, the plan adopted in the most approved\r\nFrench and German technical works. This, however, when too rigidly\r\nadhered to, as is the case with German works in particular, renders it\r\ntroublesome for even a practised engineer to grasp a strange system in\r\nits entirety, while the pupil is wearied and retarded in his reading by\r\nan over-elaborate classification.\r\n\r\nIt may, perhaps, be remarked that undue prominence has been given to the\r\ntertiary and cretaceous formations, but it is urged in extenuation that\r\nthey happen to underlie two of the most important cities in Europe, and\r\nthat they have, in consequence, received a more thorough investigation\r\nthan has been accorded to other districts. The records of wells in many\r\nformations are singularly scanty and unreliable, but it is hoped that\r\nthe time is not far distant when the water-bearing characteristics of\r\nstrata, such as the new red sandstone and permian, will receive proper\r\nattention, and that correct official records of well-work will be found\r\nin every locality, as this alone can rescue an important branch of\r\nhydraulic engineering from the charge of empiricism.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the work the writings of G. R. Burnell, C.E., Baldwin\r\nLatham, C.E., M. Dru, Emerson Bainbridge, C.E., G. C. Greenwell, and\r\nother well known authorities, have been freely referred to, particular\r\nrecourse having been had to the works of Professor Prestwich, F.G.S.\r\n\r\nI am indebted to Geo. G. André, C.E., F.G.S., Messrs. S. Baker and Son,\r\nand Messrs. T. Docwra and Son, for many suggestions and much valuable\r\ninformation; to Messrs. Docwra special thanks are due for some of the\r\nimportant sections illustrating chapter vii.\r\n\r\nAny claim to attention the book may deserve is based upon its being an\r\nattempt to embody, in a collected form, facts and information derived\r\nfrom practice, or from various sources not accessible to the majority of\r\nthose engaged in the superintendence, or otherwise interested in the\r\nconstruction of wells.\r\n\r\n  ERNEST SPON.\r\n\r\n  16, CRAVEN STREET, CHARING CROSS,\r\n  _June, 1875_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSINKING AND BORING WELLS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNearly every civil engineer is familiar with the fact that certain\r\nporous soils, such as sand or gravel, absorb water with rapidity, and\r\nthat the ground composed of them soon dries up after showers. If a well\r\nbe sunk in such soils, we often penetrate to considerable depths before\r\nwe meet with water; but this is usually found on our approaching some\r\nlower part of the porous formation where it rests on an impervious bed;\r\nfor here the water, unable to make its way downwards in a direct line,\r\naccumulates as in a reservoir, and is ready to ooze out into any opening\r\nwhich may be made, in the same manner as we see the salt water filtrate\r\ninto and fill any hollow which we dig in the sands of the shore at low\r\ntide. A spring, then, is the lowest point or lip of an underground\r\nreservoir of water in the stratification. A well, therefore, sunk in\r\nsuch strata will most probably furnish, besides the volume of the\r\nspring, an additional supply of water.\r\n\r\nThe transmission of water through a porous medium being so rapid, we may\r\neasily understand why springs are thrown out on the side of a hill,\r\nwhere the upper set of strata consist of chalk, sand, and other\r\npermeable substances, whilst those lying beneath are composed of clay or\r\nother retentive soils. The only difficulty, indeed, is to explain why\r\nthe water does not ooze out everywhere along the line of junction of the\r\ntwo formations, so as to form one continuous land-soak, instead of a\r\nfew springs only, and these oftentimes far distant from each other. The\r\nprincipal cause of such a concentration of the waters at a few points\r\nis, first, the existence of inequalities in the upper surface of the\r\nimpermeable stratum, which lead the water, as valleys do on the external\r\nsurface of a country, into certain low levels and channels; and\r\nsecondly, the frequency of rents and fissures, which act as natural\r\ndrains. That the generality of springs owe their supply to the\r\natmosphere is evident from this, that they vary in the different seasons\r\nof the year, becoming languid or entirely ceasing to flow after long\r\ndroughts, and being again replenished after a continuance of rain. Many\r\nof them are probably indebted for the constancy and uniformity of their\r\nvolume to the great extent of the subterranean reservoirs with which\r\nthey communicate, and the time required for these to empty themselves by\r\npercolation. Such a gradual and regulated discharge is exhibited, though\r\nin a less perfect degree, in all great lakes, for these are not sensibly\r\naffected in their levels by a sudden shower, but are only slightly\r\nraised, and their channels of efflux, instead of being swollen suddenly\r\nlike the bed of a torrent, carry off the surplus water gradually.\r\n\r\nAn Artesian well, so called from the province of Artois, in France, is a\r\nshaft sunk or bored through impermeable strata, until a water-bearing\r\nstratum is tapped, when the water is forced upwards by the hydrostatic\r\npressure due to the superior level at which the rain-water was received.\r\n\r\nAmong the causes of the failure of Artesian wells, we may mention those\r\nnumerous rents and faults which abound in some rocks, and the deep\r\nravines and valleys by which many countries are traversed; for when\r\nthese natural lines of drainage exist, there remains only a small\r\nquantity of water to escape by artificial issues. We are also liable to\r\nbe baffled by the great thickness either of porous or impervious strata,\r\nor by the dip of the beds, which may carry off the waters from adjoining\r\nhigh lands to some trough in an opposite direction,--as when the borings\r\nare made at the foot of an escarpment where the strata incline inwards,\r\nor in a direction opposite to the face of the cliffs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Effect of Strata on Artesian Well.\r\n\r\nFig. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Effect of a Fault.\r\n\r\nFig. 2.]\r\n\r\nAs instances of the way in which the character of the strata may\r\ninfluence the water-bearing capacity of any given locality, we give the\r\nfollowing examples, taken from Baldwin Latham's papers on 'The Supply of\r\nWater to Towns.' Fig. 1 illustrates the causes which sometimes conduce\r\nto a limited supply of water in Artesian wells. Rain descending on the\r\noutcrop E F of the porous stratum A, which lies between the impervious\r\nstratum B B, will make its appearance in the form of a spring at S; but\r\nsuch spring will not yield any great quantity of water, as the area E F,\r\nwhich receives the rainfall, is limited in its extent. A well sunk at W,\r\nin a stratum of the above description, would not be likely to furnish a\r\nlarge supply of water, if any. The effect of a fault is shown in Fig. 2.\r\nA spring will in all probability make its appearance at the point S, and\r\ngive large quantities of water, as the whole body of water flowing\r\nthrough the porous strata A is intercepted by being thrown against the\r\nimpermeable stratum B. Permeable rock intersected by a dyke and\r\noverlying an impermeable stratum is seen in Fig. 3. The water flowing\r\nthrough A, if intersected by a dyke D, will appear at S in the form of a\r\nspring, and if the area of A is of large extent, then the spring S will\r\nbe very copious. As to the depth necessary to bore certain wells, in a\r\ncase similar to Fig. 4, owing to the fault, a well sunk at A would\r\nrequire to be sunk deeper than the well B, although both wells derive\r\ntheir supply from the same description of strata. If there is any\r\ninclination in the water-bearing strata, or if there is a current of\r\nwater only in one direction, then one of the wells would prove a failure\r\nowing to the proximity of the fault, while the other would furnish an\r\nabundant supply of water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Permeable Rock Intersected by a Dyke.\r\n\r\nFig. 3.]\r\n\r\nIt should be borne in mind that there are two primary geological\r\nconditions upon which the quantity of water that may be supplied to the\r\nwater-bearing strata depends; they are, the extent of superficial area\r\npresented by these deposits, by which the quantity of rain-water\r\nreceived on their surface in any given time is determined; and the\r\ncharacter and thickness of the strata, as by this the proportion of\r\nwater that can be absorbed, and the quantity which the whole volume of\r\nthe permeable strata can transmit, is regulated. The operation of these\r\ngeneral principles will constantly vary in accordance with local\r\nphenomena, all of which must, in each separate case, be taken into\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Well Depth either side of a Fault.\r\n\r\nFig. 4.]\r\n\r\nThe mere distance of hills or mountains need not discourage us from\r\nmaking trials; for the waters which fall on these higher lands readily\r\npenetrate to great depths through highly-inclined or vertical strata, or\r\nthrough the fissures of shattered rocks; and after flowing for a great\r\ndistance, must often reascend and be brought up again by other fissures,\r\nso as to approach the surface in the lower country. Here they may be\r\nconcealed beneath a covering of undisturbed horizontal beds, which it\r\nmay be necessary to pierce in order to reach them. The course of water\r\nflowing underground is not strictly analogous to that of rivers on the\r\nsurface, there being, in the one case, a constant descent from a higher\r\nto a lower level from the source of the stream to the sea; whereas, in\r\nthe other, the water may at one time sink far below the level of the\r\nocean, and afterwards rise again high above it.\r\n\r\nFor the purposes under consideration, we may range the various strata of\r\nwhich the outer crust of the earth is composed under four heads, namely:\r\n1, drift; 2, alluvion; 3, the tertiary and secondary beds, composed of\r\nloose, arenaceous and permeable strata, impervious, argillaceous and\r\nmarly strata, and thick strata of compact rock, more or less broken up\r\nby fissures, as the Norwich red and coralline crag, the Molasse\r\nsandstones, the Bagshot sands, the London clay, and the Woolwich beds,\r\nin the tertiary division; and the chalk, chalk marl, gault, the\r\ngreensands, the Wealden clay, and the Hastings sand; the oolites, the\r\nhas, the Rhætic beds, and Keuper, and the new red sandstone, in the\r\nsecondary division; and 4, the primary beds, as the magnesian limestone,\r\nthe lower red sand, and the coal measures, which consist mainly of\r\nalternating beds of sandstones and shales with coal.\r\n\r\nThe first of these divisions, the drift, consisting mainly of sand and\r\ngravel, having been formed by the action of flowing water, is very\r\nirregular in thickness, and exists frequently in detached masses. This\r\nirregularity is due to the inequalities of the surface at the period\r\nwhen the drift was brought down. Hollows then existing would often be\r\nfilled up, while either none was deposited on level surfaces, or, if\r\ndeposited, was subsequently removed by denudation. Hence we cannot infer\r\nwhen boring through deposits of this character that the same, or nearly\r\nthe same, thickness will be found at even a few yards' distance. In\r\nvalleys this deposit may exist to a great depth, the slopes of hills are\r\nfrequently covered with drift, which has either been arrested by the\r\nelevated surface or brought down from the upper portions of that surface\r\nby the action of rain. In the former case the deposits will probably\r\nconsist of gravel, and in the latter, of the same elements as the hill\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThe permeability of such beds will, of course, depend wholly upon the\r\nnature of the deposit. Some rocks produce deposits through which water\r\npercolates readily, while others allow a passage only through such\r\nfissures as may exist. Sand and gravel constitute an extremely absorbent\r\nmedium, while an argillaceous deposit may be wholly impervious. In\r\nmountainous districts springs may often be found in the drift; their\r\nexistence in such formations will, however, depend upon the position and\r\ncharacter of the rock strata; thus, if the drift cover an elevated and\r\nextensive slope of a nature similar to that of the rocks by which it is\r\nformed, springs due to infiltration through this covering will certainly\r\nexist near the foot of the slope. Upon the opposite slope, the small\r\nspaces which exist between the different beds of rock receive these\r\ninfiltrations directly, and serve to completely drain the deposit which,\r\nin the former case, is, on the contrary, saturated with water. If,\r\nhowever, the foliations or the joints of the rocks afford no issue to\r\nthe water, whether such a circumstance be due to the character of their\r\nformation, or to the stopping up of the issues by the drift itself,\r\nthese results will not be produced.\r\n\r\nIt will be obvious how, in this way, by passing under a mass of drift\r\nthe water descending from the top of hill slopes reappears at their\r\nfoot in the form of springs. If now we suppose these issues stopped, or\r\ncovered by an impervious stratum of great thickness, and this stratum\r\npierced by a boring, the water will ascend through this new outlet to a\r\nlevel above that of its original issue, in virtue of the head of water\r\nmeasured from the points at which the infiltration takes place to the\r\npoint in which it is struck by the boring.\r\n\r\nAlluvion, like drift, consists of fragments of various strata carried\r\naway and deposited by flowing water; it differs from the latter only\r\nin being more extensive and regular, and, generally, in being composed\r\nof elements brought from a great distance, and having no analogy with\r\nthe strata with which it is in contact. Usually it consists of sand,\r\ngravel, rolled pebbles, marls or clays. The older deposits often occupy\r\nvery elevated districts, which they overlie throughout a large extent\r\nof surface. At the period when the large rivers were formed, the\r\nvalleys were filled up with alluvial deposits, which at the present day\r\nare covered by vegetable soil, and a rich growth of plants, through\r\nwhich the water percolates more slowly than formerly. The permeability\r\nof these deposits allows the water to flow away subterraneously to\r\na great distance from the points at which it enters. Springs are\r\ncommon in the alluvion, and more frequently than in the case of drift,\r\nthey can be found by boring. As the surface, which is covered by the\r\ndeposit, is extensive, the water circulates from a distance through\r\npermeable strata often overlaid by others that are impervious. If at a\r\nconsiderable distance from the points of infiltration, and at a lower\r\nlevel, a boring be put down, the water will ascend in the bore-hole\r\nin virtue of its tendency to place itself in equilibrium. Where the\r\ncountry is open and uninhabited, the water from shallow wells sunk\r\nin alluvion is generally found to be good enough and in sufficient\r\nquantity for domestic purposes.\r\n\r\nThe strata of the tertiary and secondary beds, especially the latter,\r\nare far more extensive than the preceding, and yield much larger\r\nquantities of water. The chalk is the great water-bearing stratum for\r\nthe larger portion of the south of England. The water in it can be\r\nobtained either by means of ordinary shafts, or by Artesian wells bored\r\nsometimes to great depths, from which the water will frequently rise\r\nto the surface. It should be observed that water does not circulate\r\nthrough the chalk by general permeation of the mass, but through\r\nfissures. A rule given by some for the level at which water may be\r\nfound in this stratum is, \"Take the level of the highest source of\r\nsupply, and that of the lowest to be found. The mean level will be the\r\ndepth at which water will be found at any intermediate point, after\r\nallowing an inclination of at least 10 feet a mile.\" This rule will\r\nalso apply to the greensand. This formation contains large quantities\r\nof water, which is more evenly distributed than in the chalk. The gault\r\nclay is interposed between the upper and the lower greensand, the\r\nlatter of which also furnishes good supplies. In boring into the upper\r\ngreensand, caution should be observed so as not to pierce the gault\r\nclay, because water which permeates through that system becomes either\r\nferruginous, or contaminated by salts and other impurities.\r\n\r\nThe next strata in which water is found are the upper and inferior\r\noolites, between which are the Kimmeridge and Oxford clays, which are\r\nseparated by the coral rag. There are instances in which the Oxford clay\r\nis met with immediately below the Kimmeridge, rendering any attempt at\r\nboring useless, because the water in the Oxford clay is generally so\r\nimpure as to be unfit for use. And with regard to finding water in the\r\noolitic limestone, it is impossible to determine with any amount of\r\nprecision the depth at which it may be reached, owing to the numerous\r\nfaults which occur in the formation. It will therefore be necessary to\r\nemploy the greatest care before proceeding with any borings. Lower down\r\nin the order are the upper has, the marlstone, the lower has, and the\r\nnew red sandstone. In the marlstone, between the upper and lower beds of\r\nthe has, there may be found a large supply of water, but the level of\r\nthis is as a rule too low to rise to the surface through a boring. It\r\nwill be necessary to sink shafts in the ordinary way to reach it. In the\r\nnew red sandstone, also, to find the water, borings must be made to a\r\nconsiderable depth, but when this formation exists a copious supply may\r\nbe confidently anticipated, and when found the water is of excellent\r\nquality.\r\n\r\nEvery permeable stratum may yield water, and its ability to do this, and\r\nthe quantity it can yield, depend upon its position and extent. When\r\nunderlaid by an impervious stratum, it constitutes a reservoir of water\r\nfrom which a supply may be drawn by means of a sinking or a bore-hole.\r\nIf the permeable stratum be also overlaid by an impervious stratum, the\r\nwater will be under pressure and will ascend the bore-hole to a height\r\nthat will depend on the height of the points of infiltration above the\r\nbottom of the bore-hole. The quantity to be obtained in such a case as\r\nwe have already pointed out, will depend upon the extent of surface\r\npossessed by the outcrop of the permeable stratum. In searching for\r\nwater under such conditions a careful examination of the geological\r\nfeatures of the district must be made. Frequently an extended view of\r\nthe surface of the district, such as may be obtained from an eminence,\r\nand a consideration of the particular configuration of that surface,\r\nwill be sufficient to enable the practical eye to discover the various\r\nroutes which are followed by the subterranean water, and to predicate\r\nwith some degree of certainty that at a given point water will be found\r\nin abundance, or that no water at all exists at that point. To do this,\r\nit is sufficient to note the dip and the surfaces of the strata which\r\nare exposed to the rains. When these strata are nearly horizontal, water\r\ncan penetrate them only through their fissures or pores; when, on the\r\ncontrary, they lie at right-angles, they absorb the larger portion of\r\nthe water that falls upon their outcrop. When such strata are\r\nintercepted by valleys, numerous springs will exist. But if, instead of\r\nbeing intercepted, the strata rise around a common point, they form a\r\nkind of irregular basin, in the centre of which the water will\r\naccumulate. In this case the surface springs will be less numerous than\r\nwhen the strata are broken. But it is possible to obtain water under\r\npressure in the lower portions of the basin, if the point at which the\r\ntrial is made is situate below the outcrop.\r\n\r\nThe primary rocks afford generally but little water. Having been\r\nsubjected to violent convulsions, they are thrown into every possible\r\nposition and broken by numerous fissures; and as no permeable stratum is\r\ninterposed, as in the more recent formations, no reservoir of water\r\nexists. In the unstratified rocks, the water circulates in all\r\ndirections through the fissures that traverse them, and thus occupies no\r\nfixed level. It is also impossible to discover by a surface examination\r\nwhere the fissures may be struck by a boring. For purposes of water\r\nsupply, therefore, these rocks are of little importance. It must be\r\nremarked here, however, that large quantities of water are frequently\r\nmet with in the magnesian limestone and the lower red sand, which form\r\nthe upper portion of the primary series.\r\n\r\nJoseph Prestwich, jun., in his 'Geological Inquiry respecting the\r\nWater-bearing Strata round London,' gives the following valuable epitome\r\nof the geological conditions affecting the value of water-bearing\r\ndeposits; and although the illustrations are confined to the Tertiary\r\ndeposits, the same mode of inquiry will apply with but little\r\nmodification to any other formation.\r\n\r\nThe main points are--\r\n\r\nThe extent of the superficial area occupied by the water-bearing\r\ndeposit.\r\n\r\nThe lithological character and thickness of the water-bearing deposit,\r\nand the extent of its underground range.\r\n\r\nThe position of the outcrop of the deposit, whether in valleys or hills,\r\nand whether its outcrop is denuded, or covered with any description of\r\ndrift.\r\n\r\nThe general elevation of the country occupied by this outcrop above the\r\nlevels of the district in which it is proposed to sink wells.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of rain which falls in the district under consideration,\r\nand whether, in addition, it receives any portion of the drainage from\r\nadjoining tracts, when the strata are impermeable.\r\n\r\nThe disturbances which may affect the water-bearing strata, and break\r\ntheir continuous character, as by this the subterranean flow of water\r\nwould be impeded or prevented.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTENT OF SUPERFICIAL AREA.\r\n\r\nTo proceed to the application of the questions in the particular\r\ninstance of the lower tertiary strata. With regard to the first\r\nquestion, it is evident that a series of permeable strata encased\r\nbetween two impermeable formations can receive a supply of water at\r\nthose points only where they crop out and are exposed on the surface of\r\nthe land. The primary conditions affecting the result depend upon the\r\nfall of rain in the district where the outcrop takes place; the quantity\r\nof rain-water which any permeable strata can gather being in the same\r\nratio as their respective areas. If the mean annual fall in any district\r\namounts to 24 inches, then each square mile will receive a daily average\r\nof 950,947 gallons of rain-water. It is therefore a matter of essential\r\nimportance to ascertain, with as much accuracy as possible, the extent\r\nof exposed surface of any water-bearing deposit, so as to determine the\r\nmaximum quantity of rain-water it is capable of receiving.\r\n\r\nThe surface formed by the outcropping of any deposit in a country of\r\nhill and valley is necessarily extremely limited, and it would be\r\ndifficult to measure in the ordinary way. Prestwich therefore used\r\nanother method, which seems to give results sufficiently accurate for\r\nthe purpose. It is a plan borrowed from geographers, that of cutting out\r\nfrom a map on paper of uniform thickness and on a large scale, say one\r\ninch to the mile, and weighing the superficial area of each deposit.\r\nKnowing the weight of a square of 100 miles cut out of the same paper,\r\nit is easy to estimate roughly the area in square miles of any other\r\nsurface, whatever may be its figure.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINERAL CHARACTER OF THE FORMATION.\r\n\r\nThe second question relates to the mineral character of the formation,\r\nand the effect it will have upon the quantity of water which it may hold\r\nor transmit.\r\n\r\nIf the strata consist of sand, water will pass through them with\r\nfacility, and they will also hold a considerable quantity between the\r\ninterstices of their component grains; whereas a bed of pure clay will\r\nnot allow of the passage of water. These are the two extremes of the\r\ncase; the intermixture of these materials in the same bed will of\r\ncourse, according to their relative proportions, modify the transmission\r\nof water. Prestwich found by experiment that a silicious sand of\r\nordinary character will hold on an average rather more than one-third of\r\nits bulk of water, or from two to two and a half gallons in one cubic\r\nfoot. In strata so composed the water may be termed free, as it passes\r\neasily in all directions, and under the pressure of a column of water is\r\ncomparatively but little impeded by capillary attraction. These are the\r\nconditions of a true permeable stratum. Where the strata are more\r\ncompact and solid, as in sandstone, limestone, and oolite, although all\r\nsuch rocks imbibe more or less water, yet the water so absorbed does not\r\npass freely through the mass, but is held in the pores of the rock by\r\ncapillary attraction, and parted with very slowly; so that in such\r\ndeposits water can be freely transmitted only in the planes of bedding\r\nand in fissures. If the water-bearing deposit is of uniform lithological\r\ncharacter over a large area, then the proposition is reduced to its\r\nsimplest form; but when, as in the deposit between the London clay and\r\nthe chalk, the strata consist of variable mineral ingredients, it\r\nbecomes essential to estimate the extent of these variations; for very\r\ndifferent conclusions might be drawn from an inspection of the Lower\r\nTertiary strata at different localities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _a_ London clay, _b_ Sands and clay, _c_ Chalk.\r\n\r\nFig. 5.]\r\n\r\nIn the fine section exposed in the cliffs between Herne Bay and the\r\nReculvers, in England, a considerable mass of fossiliferous sands is\r\nseen to rise from beneath the London clay. Fig. 5 represents a view of a\r\nportion of this cliff a mile and a half east of Herne Bay and continued\r\ndownwards, by estimation below the surface of the ground to the chalk.\r\nIn this section there is evidently a very large proportion of sand, and\r\nconsequently a large capacity for water. Again, at Upnor, near\r\nRochester, the sands marked 3 are as much as 60 to 80 feet thick, and\r\ncontinue so to Gravesend, Purfleet, and Erith. In the first of these\r\nplaces they may be seen capping Windmill Hill; in the second, forming\r\nthe hill, now removed, on which the lighthouse is built; and in the\r\nthird, in the large ballast pits on the banks of the river Thames. The\r\naverage thickness of these sands in this district may be about 50 to 60\r\nfeet. In their range from east to west, the beds 2 become more clayey\r\nand less permeable, and 1, very thin. As we approach London the\r\nthickness of 3 also diminishes. In the ballast pits at the west end of\r\nWoolwich, this sand-bed is not more than 35 feet thick, and as it passes\r\nunder London becomes still thinner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.\r\n\r\nGeneral Section of Strata below London.]\r\n\r\nFig. 6 is a general or average section of the strata on which London\r\nstands. The increase in the proportion of the argillaceous strata, and\r\nthe decrease of the beds of sand, in the Lower Tertiary strata is here\r\nvery apparent, and from this point westward to Hungerford, clays\r\ndecidedly predominate; while at the same time the series presents such\r\nrapid variations, even on the same level and at short distances, that no\r\ntwo sections are alike. On the southern boundary of the Tertiary\r\ndistrict, from Croydon to Leatherhead, the sands 3 maintain a thickness\r\nof 20 to 40 feet, whilst the associated beds of clay are of inferior\r\nimportance. We will take another section, Fig. 7, representing the\r\nusual features of the deposit in the northern part of the Tertiary\r\ndistrict. It is from a cutting at a brickfield west of the small village\r\nof Hedgerley, 6 miles northward of Windsor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Unusual Deposit Features 6 miles North of Windsor.\r\n\r\nFig. 7.]\r\n\r\nHere we see a large development of the mottled clays, and but little\r\nsand. A somewhat similar section is exhibited at Oak End, near Chalfont\r\nSt. Giles. But to show how rapidly this series changes its character,\r\nthe section of a pit only a third of a mile westward of the one at\r\nHedgerley is given in Fig. 8.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Section of a Pit.\r\n\r\nFig. 8.]\r\n\r\nIn this latter section the mottled clays have nearly disappeared, and\r\nare replaced by beds of sand with thin seams of mottled clays. At\r\nTwyford, near Reading, and at Old Basing, near Basingstoke, the mottled\r\nclays again occupy, as at Hedgerley, nearly the whole space between the\r\nLondon clays and the chalk. Near Reading a good section of these beds\r\nwas exhibited in the Sonning cutting of the Great Western Railway; they\r\nconsisted chiefly of mottled clays. At the Katsgrove pits, Reading, the\r\nbeds are more sandy. Referring back to Fig. 6, it may be noticed that\r\nthere is generally a small quantity of water found in the bed marked 1,\r\nin parts of the neighbourhood of London. Owing, however, to the constant\r\npresence of green and ferruginous sands, traces of vegetable matters and\r\nremains of fossil shells, the water is usually indifferent and\r\nchalybeate. The well-diggers term this a slow spring. They well express\r\nthe difference by saying that the water creeps up from this stratum,\r\nwhereas that it bursts up from the lower sands 3, which is the great\r\nwater-bearing stratum. In the irregular sand-beds interstratified with\r\nthe mottled clays between these two strata water is also found, but not\r\nin any large quantity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Section at Pebble Hill.\r\n\r\nFig. 9.]\r\n\r\nFig. 9 is a section at the western extremity of the Tertiary district at\r\nPebble Hill, near Hungerford. Here again the mottled clays are in\r\nconsiderable force, sands forming the smaller part of the series.\r\n\r\nThe following lists exhibit the aggregate thickness of all the beds of\r\nsand occurring between the London clay and the chalk at various\r\nlocalities in the Tertiary district. It will appear from them that the\r\nmean results of the whole is very different from any of those obtained\r\nin separate divisions of the country. The mean thickness of the deposit\r\nthroughout the whole Tertiary area may be taken at 62 feet, of which 36\r\nfeet consist of sands and 26 feet of clays; but as only a portion of\r\nthis district contributes to the water supply of London, it will\r\nfacilitate our inquiry if we divide it into two parts, the one westward\r\nof and including London, and the other eastward of it, introducing also\r\nsome further subdivisions into each.\r\n\r\nMEASUREMENT OF SECTIONS EASTWARD OF LONDON.\r\n\r\n  +---------------------+-----+-----+\r\n  |Southern Boundary.   |Sand.|Clay.|\r\n  +---------------------+-----+-----+\r\n  |                     | ft. | ft. |\r\n  |Lewisham             | 65  | 26  |\r\n  |Woolwich             | 66  | 18  |\r\n  |Upnor                | 80?

The larger area, 1849 square miles, over which the\r\neastern portion of the Tertiary series extends, and the greater volume\r\nof the water-bearing beds, constitute important differences in favour of\r\nthis district; and if there had been no geological disturbances to\r\ninterfere with the continuous character of the strata, we might have\r\nlooked to this quarter for a large supply of water to the Artesian wells\r\nof London.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Geological Section.\r\n\r\nFig. 10.]\r\n\r\nFrom these tables it will be readily perceived that the strata of which\r\nthe water-bearing deposits are composed are very variable in their\r\nrelative thickness. They consist, in fact, of alternating beds of clay\r\nand sand, in proportions constantly changing. In one place, as at\r\nHedgerley, the aggregate beds of sand may be 5 feet thick, and the clays\r\n45 feet; whilst at another, as at Leatherhead, the sands may be 35, and\r\nthe clays 20 feet thick, and some such variation is observable in every\r\nlocality. But although we may thus in some measure judge of the capacity\r\nof these beds for water, this method fails to show whether the\r\ncommunication from one part of the area to another is free, or impeded\r\nby causes connected with mineral character. Now as we know that these\r\nbeds not only vary in their thickness, but that they also frequently\r\nthin out, and sometimes pass one into another, it may happen that a very\r\nlarge development of clay at any one place may altogether stop the\r\ntransit of the water in that locality. Thus in Fig. 10 the beds of sand\r\nat y allow of the free passage of water, but at x, where clays occupy\r\nthe whole thickness, it cannot pass; the obstruction which this cause\r\nmay offer to the underground flow of water can only be determined by\r\nexperience. It must not, however, be supposed that such a variation in\r\nthe strata is permanent or general along any given line. It is always\r\nlocal, some of the beds of clay commonly thinning out after a certain\r\nhorizontal range, so that, although the water may be impeded or\r\nretarded in a direct course, it most probably can, in part or\r\naltogether, pass round by some point where the strata have not undergone\r\nthe same alteration.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSITION AND GENERAL CONDITIONS OF THE OUTCROP.\r\n\r\nThis involves some considerations to which an exact value cannot at\r\npresent be given, yet which require notice, as they to a great extent\r\ndetermine the proportion of water which can pass from the surface into\r\nthe mass of the water-bearing strata. In the first place, when the\r\noutcrop of these strata occurs in a valley, as represented in Fig. 11,\r\nit is evident that _b_ may not only retain all the water which might\r\nfall on its surface, but also would receive a proportion of that\r\ndraining off from the strata of _a_ and _c_. This form of the surface\r\ngenerally prevails wherever the water-bearing strata are softer and less\r\ncoherent than the strata above and below them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Water-bearing Strata in a Valley.\r\n\r\nFig. 11.]\r\n\r\nIt may be observed in the Lower Tertiary series at Sutton, Carshalton,\r\nand Croydon, where a small and shallow valley, excavated in these sands\r\nand mottled clays, ranges parallel with the chalk hills.\r\n\r\nIt is apparent again between Epsom and Leatherhead, and also in some\r\nplaces between Guildford and Farnham, as well as between Odiham and\r\nKingsclere. The Southampton Railway crosses this small valley on an\r\nembankment at Old Basing.\r\n\r\nThis may be considered as the prevailing, but not exclusive, form of\r\nstructure from Croydon to near Hungerford. The advantage, however, to be\r\ngained from it in point of water supply is much limited by the rather\r\nhigh angle at which the strata are inclined, as well as by their small\r\ndevelopment, which greatly restrict the breadth of the surface occupied\r\nby the outcrop. It rarely exceeds a quarter of a mile, and is generally\r\nvery much less, often not more than 100 to 200 feet. The next\r\nmodification of outcrop, represented in Fig. 12, is one not uncommon on\r\nthe south side of the Tertiary district. The strata _b_ here crop out on\r\nthe slope of the chalk hills, and the rain falling upon them, unless\r\nrapidly absorbed, tends to drain at once from their surface into the\r\nadjacent valleys. V, L, shows the line of valley level.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Strata on Slope of Chalk Hills.\r\n\r\nFig. 12.]\r\n\r\nThis arrangement is not unfrequent between Kingsclere and Inkpen, and\r\nalso between Guildford and Leatherhead. Eastward of London it is\r\nexhibited on a larger scale at the base of the chalk hills, in places\r\nbetween Chatham and Faversham, a line along which the sands of the Lower\r\nTertiary strata, _b_, are more fully developed than elsewhere. As,\r\nhowever, the surface of _b_ is there usually more coincident with the\r\nvalley level, V, L, of the district, it is in a better position for\r\nretaining more of the rainfall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chalk Stratum at Base of a Hill.\r\n\r\nFig. 13.]\r\n\r\nA third position of outcrop, much more unfavourable for the\r\nwater-bearing strata, prevails generally along the greater part of the\r\nnorthern boundary of the Tertiary strata. Instead of forming a valley,\r\nor outcropping at the base of the chalk hills, almost the whole length\r\nof this outcrop lies on the slope of the hills, as in Fig. 13, where the\r\nchalk _c_ forms the base of the hill and the lower ground at its foot,\r\nwhilst the London clay, _a_, caps the summit, thus restricting the\r\noutcrop of _b_ to a very narrow zone and a sloping surface. This form\r\nof structure is exhibited in the hills round Sonning, Reading,\r\nHedgerley, Rickmansworth, and Watford; thence by Shenley Hill, Hatfield,\r\nHertford, Sudbury; and also at Hadleigh this position of outcrop is\r\ncontinued. If, as on the southern side of the Tertiary district, the\r\noutcrop were continued in a nearly unbroken line, then these\r\nunfavourable conditions would prevail uninterruptedly; but the hills are\r\nin broken groups, and intersected at short distances by transverse\r\nvalleys, as that of the Kennet at Reading, of the Loddon at Twyford, of\r\nthe Colne at Uxbridge, and so on. Between Watford and Hatfield there is\r\na constant succession of small valleys running back for short distances\r\nfrom the Lower district of the chalk, through the hills of the Tertiary\r\ndistrict. The Valley of the Lea at Roydon and Hoddesdon is a similar and\r\nstronger case in point. The effect of these transverse valleys is to\r\nopen out a larger surface of the strata _b_ than would otherwise be\r\nexposed, for if the horizontal line, V, L, Fig. 13, were carried back\r\nbeyond the point _x_, to meet the prolongation of _b_, then these Lower\r\nTertiary strata would not only be intersected by the line of valley\r\nlevel, but would form a much smaller angle with the plane V, L, and\r\ntherefore spread over a larger area than where they crop out on the side\r\nof the hills.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing are the three most general forms of outcrop, but\r\noccasionally the outcrop takes place wholly or partly on the summit of a\r\nhill, as, near the Reculvers in the neighbourhood of Canterbury, of\r\nSittingbourne, and at the Addington Hills, near Croydon, in which cases\r\nthe area of the Lower Tertiary is expanded. When the dip is very slight,\r\nand the beds nearly horizontal, the Lower Tertiary sands occasionally\r\nspread over a still larger extent of surface, as between Stoke Pogis,\r\nBurnham Common, and Beaconsfield, and in the case of the flat-topped\r\nhill, forming Blackheath and Bexley Heath, as in Fig. 14. Favourable as\r\nsuch districts might at first appear to be from the extent of their\r\nexposed surface, nevertheless they rarely contribute to the water supply\r\nof the wells sunk into the Lower Tertiary sands under London, the\r\ncontinuity of the strata being broken by intersecting valleys; thus the\r\ndistrict last mentioned is bounded on the north by the valley of the\r\nThames, on the west by that of Ravensbourne, and on the east by the\r\nvalley of the Cray; consequently the rain-water, which has been absorbed\r\nby the very permeable strata on the intermediate higher ground, passes\r\nout on the sides of the hills, into the surface channels in the valleys,\r\nor into the chalk. Almost all the wells at Bexley Heath, for their\r\nsupply of water, have, in fact, to be sunk into the chalk through the\r\noverlying 100 to 133 feet of sand and pebble beds, _b_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Section at Blackheath and Bexley Heath.\r\n\r\nFig. 14.]\r\n\r\nThus far we have considered this question, as if, in each instance, the\r\noutcropping edges of the water-bearing strata, _b_, were laid bare, and\r\npresented no impediment to the absorption of the rain-water falling\r\nimmediately upon their surface, or passing on to it from some more\r\nimpermeable deposits. But there is another consideration which\r\ninfluences materially the extent of the water supply.\r\n\r\nIf the strata _b_ were always bare, we should have to consider their\r\noutcrop as an absorbent surface, of power varying according to the\r\nlithological character and dip of the strata only. But the outcropping\r\nedges of the strata do not commonly present bare and denuded surfaces.\r\nThus a large extent of the country round London is more or less covered\r\nby beds of drift, which protect the outcropping beds of _b_, and turn\r\noff a portion of the water falling upon them.\r\n\r\nThe drift differs considerably in its power of interference with the\r\npassage of the rain-water into the strata beneath. The ochreous sandy\r\nflint gravel, forming so generally the subsoil of London, admits of the\r\npassage of water. All the shallow surface springs, from 10 to 20 feet\r\ndeep, are produced by water which has fallen on, and passed through,\r\nthis gravel, _g_, Fig. 15, down to the top of the London clay, _a_, on\r\nthe irregular surface of which it is held up.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Section through London Subsoil.\r\n\r\nFig. 15.]\r\n\r\nWhen the London clay is wanting, this gravel lies immediately upon the\r\nLower Tertiary strata, as in the valley between Windsor and Maidenhead,\r\nand in that of the Kennet between Newbury and Thatcham, transmitting to\r\nthe underlying strata part of the surface water. Where beds of brick\r\nearth occur in the drift, as between West Drayton and Uxbridge, the\r\npassage of the surface water into the underlying strata is intercepted.\r\n\r\nSometimes the drift is composed of gravel mixed very irregularly with\r\nbroken up London clay, and although commonly not more than 3 to 8 feet\r\nthick, it is generally impermeable.\r\n\r\nOver a considerable portion of Suffolk and part of Essex, a drift,\r\ncomposed of coarse and usually light-coloured sand with fine gravel,\r\noccurs. Water percolates through it with extreme facility, but it is\r\ngenerally covered by a thick mass of stiff tenacious bluish grey clay,\r\nperfectly impervious. This clay drift, or boulder clay, caps, to a depth\r\nof from 10 to 50 feet or more, almost all the hills in the northern\r\ndivision of Essex, and a large portion of Suffolk and Norfolk. It so\r\nconceals the underlying strata that it is difficult to trace the course\r\nof the outcrop of the Lower Tertiary sands between Ware and Ipswich; and\r\noften, as in Fig. 16, notwithstanding the breadth, apart from this cause\r\nof the outcrop of the Tertiary sands, _b_, and of the drift of sand and\r\ngravel, 2, they are both so covered by the boulder clay, 1, that the\r\nsmall surface exposed can be of comparatively little value.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Outcrop covered by Boulder Clay.\r\n\r\nFig. 16.]\r\n\r\nThere are also, in some valleys, river deposits of silt, mud, and\r\ngravel. These are, however, of little importance to the subject before\r\nus. Under ordinary conditions they are generally sufficiently impervious\r\nto prevent the water from passing through the beds beneath.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEIGHT OF WATER-BEARING STRATA ABOVE SURFACE OF COUNTRY.\r\n\r\nThe height of the districts, wherein the water-bearing strata crop out,\r\nabove that of the surface of the country in which the wells are placed,\r\nshould be made the subject of careful consideration, as upon this point\r\ndepends the level to which the water in Artesian wells may ascend.\r\n\r\nAgain, taking the London district as an example, Prestwich remarks that,\r\nas the country rises on both sides of the Thames to the edge of the\r\nchalk escarpments, and as the outcrop of the Lower Tertiary strata is\r\nintermediate between these escarpments and the Thames, it follows that\r\nthe outcrop of these lower beds must, in all cases, be on a higher level\r\nthan the Thames itself, where it flows through the centre of the\r\nTertiary district. Its altitude is, of course, very variable, as shown\r\nin the following list of its approximate height above Trinity high\r\nwater-mark at London. These heights are taken where the Tertiaries are\r\nat their lowest level in the several localities mentioned.\r\n\r\n  --------------------------------+-------------------------\r\n          South of London.        |     North of London.\r\n  --------------------------------+-------------------------\r\n  Croydon         about 130 feet. | Thetford about 200 feet.\r\n  Leatherhead       \"    90  \"    | Watford    \"   170  \"\r\n  Guildford         \"    96  \"    | Slough     \"    60  \"\r\n  Old Basing        \"   250  \"    | Reading    \"   120  \"\r\n  Near Hungerford   \"   360  \"    | Newbury    \"   236  \"\r\n  --------------------------------+-------------------------\r\n\r\nEastward of London these strata crop out at a gradually decreasing\r\nlevel. In consequence, therefore, of the outcrop of the water-bearing\r\nstrata being thus much above the surface of the central Tertiary\r\ndistrict bordering the Thames, the water in these strata beneath London\r\ntended originally to rise above that surface.\r\n\r\nAs, however, these beds crop out on a level with the Thames immediately\r\neast of the city between Deptford, Blackwall, and Bow, the water, having\r\nthis natural issue so near, could never have risen in London much above\r\nthe level of the river.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAINFALL IN THE DISTRICT WHERE THE WATER-BEARING STRATA CROP OUT.\r\n\r\nWhen inquiring into the probable relative value of any water-bearing\r\nstrata, it is necessary to compare the rainfall in their respective\r\ndistricts.\r\n\r\nRain is of all meteorological phenomena the most capricious, both as\r\nregards its frequency and the amount which falls in a given time. In\r\nsome places it rarely or never falls, whilst in others it rains almost\r\nevery day; and there does not yet exist any theory from which a probable\r\nestimate of the rainfall in a given district can be deduced\r\nindependently of direct observation. But although dealing with one of\r\nthe most capricious of the elements, we nevertheless find a workable\r\naverage in the quantity of rain to be expected in any particular place,\r\nif careful and continued observations are made with the rain-gauge. G.\r\nJ. Symons, the meteorologist, to whose continued investigations we are\r\nindebted for our most reliable data upon the subject of rainfall, gives\r\nthe following practical instructions for using a rain-gauge;--\r\n\r\n\"The mouth of the gauge must be set quite level, and so fixed that it\r\nwill remain so; it should never be less than 6 inches above the ground,\r\nnor more than 1 foot except when a greater elevation is absolutely\r\nnecessary to obtain a proper exposure.\r\n\r\n\"It must be set on a level piece of ground, at a distance from shrubs,\r\ntrees, walls, and buildings, at the very least as many feet from their\r\nbase as they are in height.\r\n\r\n\"If a thoroughly clear site cannot be obtained, shelter is most\r\nendurable from N.W., N., and E., less so from S., S.E., and W., and not\r\nat all from S.W. or N.E.\r\n\r\n\"Special prohibition must issue as to keeping all tall-growing flowers\r\naway from the gauges.\r\n\r\n\"In order to prevent rust, it will be desirable to give the japanned\r\ngauges a coat of paint every two or three years.\r\n\r\n\"The gauge should, if possible, be emptied daily at 9 A.M., and the\r\namount entered against the previous day.\r\n\r\n\"When making an observation, care should be taken to hold the glass\r\nupright.\r\n\r\n\"It can hardly be necessary to give here a treatise on decimal\r\narithmetic; suffice it therefore to say that rain-gauge glasses usually\r\nhold half an inch of rain (0·50) and that each 1/100 (0·01) is marked;\r\nif the fall is less than half an inch, the number of hundredths is read\r\noff at once, if it is over half an inch, the glass must be filled up to\r\nthe half inch (0·50), and the remainder (say 0·22) measured afterwards,\r\nthe total (0·50 + 0·22) = 0·72 being entered. If less than 1/10 (0·10)\r\nhas fallen, the cipher must always be prefixed; thus if the measure is\r\nfull up to the seventh line, it must be entered as 0·07, that is, no\r\ninches, no tenths, and seven hundredths. For the sake of clearness it\r\nhas been found necessary to lay down an invariable rule that there shall\r\nalways be two figures to the right of the decimal point. If there be\r\nonly one figure, as in the case of one-tenth of an inch, usually written\r\n0·1, a cipher must be added, making it 0·10. Neglect of this rule causes\r\nmuch inconvenience.\r\n\r\n\"In snow three methods may be adopted--it is well to try them all. 1.\r\nMelt what is caught in the funnel, and measure that as rain. 2. Select a\r\nplace where the snow has not drifted, invert the funnel, and turning it\r\nround, lift and melt what is enclosed. 3. Measure with a rule the\r\naverage depth of snow, and take one-twelfth as the equivalent of water.\r\nSome observers use in snowy weather a cylinder of the same diameter as\r\nthe rain-gauge, and of considerable depth. If the wind is at all rough,\r\nall the snow is blown out of a flat-funnelled rain-gauge.\"\r\n\r\nA drainage area is almost always a district of country enclosed by a\r\nridge or watershed line, continuous except at the place where the waters\r\nof the basin find an outlet. It may be, and generally is, divided by\r\nbranch ridge-lines into a number of smaller basins, each drained by its\r\nown stream into the main stream. In order to measure the area of a\r\ncatchment basin a plan of the country is required, which either shows\r\nthe ridge-lines or gives data for finding their positions by means of\r\ndetached levels, or of contour lines.\r\n\r\nWhen a catchment basin is very extensive it is advisable to measure the\r\nsmaller basins of which it consists, as the depths of rainfall in them\r\nmay be different; and sometimes, also, for the same reason, to divide\r\nthose basins into portions at different distances from the mountain\r\nchains, where rain-clouds are chiefly formed.\r\n\r\nThe exceptional cases, in which the boundary of a drainage area is not a\r\nridge-line on the surface of the country, are those in which the\r\nrain-water sinks into a porous stratum until its descent is stopped by\r\nan impervious stratum, and in which, consequently, one boundary at least\r\nof the drainage area depends on the figure of the impervious stratum,\r\nbeing, in fact, a ridge-line on the upper surface of that stratum,\r\ninstead of on the ground, and very often marking the upper edge of the\r\noutcrop of that stratum. If the porous stratum is partly covered by a\r\nsecond impervious stratum, the nearest ridge-line on the latter stratum\r\nto the point where the porous stratum crops out will be another boundary\r\nof the drainage area. In order to determine a drainage area under these\r\ncircumstances it is necessary to have a geological map and sections of\r\nthe district.\r\n\r\nThe depth of rainfall in a given time varies to a great extent at\r\ndifferent seasons, in different years, and in different places. The\r\nextreme limits of annual depth of rainfall in different parts of the\r\nworld may be held to be respectively nothing and 150 inches. The average\r\nannual depth of rainfall in different parts of Britain ranges from 22\r\ninches to 140 inches, and the least annual depth recorded in Britain is\r\nabout 15 inches.\r\n\r\nThe rainfall in different parts of a given country is, in general,\r\ngreatest in those districts which lie towards the quarter from which the\r\nprevailing winds blow; in Great Britain, for instance, the western\r\ndistricts have the most rain. Upon a given mountain ridge, however, the\r\nreverse is the case, the greatest rainfall taking place on that side\r\nwhich lies to leeward, as regards the prevailing winds. To the same\r\ncause may be ascribed the fact that the rainfall is greater in\r\nmountainous than in flat districts, and greater at points near high\r\nmountain summits than at points farther from them; and the difference\r\ndue to elevation is often greater by far than that due to 100 miles\r\ngeographical distance.\r\n\r\nThe most important data respecting the depth of rainfall in a given\r\ndistrict, for practical purposes, are, the least annual rainfall; mean\r\nannual rainfall; greatest annual rainfall; distribution of the rainfall\r\nat different seasons, and especially, the longest continuous drought;\r\ngreatest flood rainfall, or continuous fall of rain in a short period.\r\n\r\nThe available rainfall of a district is that part of the total rainfall\r\nwhich remains to be stored in reservoirs, or carried away by streams,\r\nafter deducting the loss through evaporation, through permanent\r\nabsorption by plants and by the ground, and other causes.\r\n\r\nThe proportion borne by the available to the total rainfall varies very\r\nmuch, being affected by the rapidity of the rainfall and the compactness\r\nor porosity of the soil, the steepness or flatness of the ground, the\r\nnature and quantity of the vegetation upon it, the temperature and\r\nmoisture of the air, which will affect the rate of evaporation, the\r\nexistence of artificial drains, and other circumstances. The following\r\nare examples:\r\n\r\n                                               Available Rainfall.\r\n                      Ground.                          ÷\r\n                                                 Total Rainfall.\r\n\r\n  Steep surfaces of granite, gneiss, and slate, nearly 1\r\n  Moorland and hilly pasture                    from  ·8 to ·6\r\n  Flat cultivated country                       from  ·5 to ·4\r\n  Chalk                                                0\r\n\r\nDeep-seated springs and wells give from ·3 to ·4 of the total rainfall.\r\nStephenson found that for the chalk district round Watford the\r\nevaporation was about 34 per cent., the quantity carried off by streams\r\n23·2 per cent., leaving 42·8 per cent., which sank below the surface to\r\nform springs. In formations less absorbent than the chalk it can be\r\ncalculated roughly, that streams carry off one-third, that another\r\nthird evaporates, and that the remaining third of the total rainfall\r\nsinks into the earth.\r\n\r\nSuch data as the above may be used in approximately estimating the\r\nprobable available rainfall of a district; but a much more accurate and\r\nsatisfactory method is to measure the actual discharge of the streams,\r\nand the quantity lost by evaporation, at the same time that the\r\nrain-gauge observations are made, and so to find the actual proportion\r\nof available to total rainfall.\r\n\r\nThe following Table gives the mean annual rainfall in various parts of\r\nthe world;--\r\n\r\nTABLE OF RAINFALL.

But if the strata is broken, the\r\ninterference with the subterranean transmission of water will be\r\nproportionate to the extent of the disturbance.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Tertiary formations around London have probably suffered\r\nless from the action of disturbing forces than the strata of any other\r\ndistrict of the same extent in England, yet they nevertheless now\r\nexhibit considerable alterations from their original position.\r\n\r\nThe principal change has been that which, by elevation of the sides or\r\ndepression of the centre of the district, gave the Tertiary deposits\r\ntheir present trough-shaped form, assuming it not to be the result of\r\noriginal deposition. If no further change had taken place we might have\r\nexpected to find an uninterrupted communication in the Lower Tertiary\r\nstrata from their northern outcrop at Hertford to their southern outcrop\r\nat Croydon, as well as from Newbury on the west to the sea on the east;\r\nand the entire length of 260 miles of outcrop would have contributed to\r\nthe general supply of water at the centre.\r\n\r\nBut this is far from being the case; several disturbing causes have\r\nderanged the regularity of original structure. The principal one has\r\ncaused a low axis of elevation, or rather a line of flexure running east\r\nand west, following nearly the course of the Thames from the Nore to\r\nDeptford, and apparently continued thence beyond Windsor. It brings up\r\nthe chalk at Cliff, Purfleet, Woolwich, and Loampit Hill to varied but\r\nmoderate elevations above the river level. Between Lewisham and Deptford\r\nthe chalk disappears below the Tertiary series, and does not come to the\r\nsurface till we reach the neighbourhood of Windsor and Maidenhead.\r\n\r\nThere is also, probably, another line of disturbance running between\r\nsome points north and south and intersecting the first line at Deptford.\r\nIt passes apparently near Beckenham and Lewisham, and then, crossing the\r\nThames near Deptford, continues up a part, if not along the whole length\r\nof the valley of the Lea towards Hoddesdon. This disturbance appears in\r\nsome places to have resulted in a fracture or a fault in the strata,\r\nplacing the beds on the east of it on a higher level than those on the\r\nwest; and at other places merely to have produced a curvature in the\r\nstrata. Prestwich states that he was unable to give its exact course,\r\nbut its effect, at all events upon the water supply of London, is\r\nimportant, as, in conjunction with the first or Thames valley\r\ndisturbance, it cuts off the supplies from the whole of Kent, and\r\ninterferes most materially with the supply from Essex; for in its course\r\nup the valley of the Lea it either brings up the Lower Tertiary strata\r\nto the surface, as at Stratford and Bow, or else, as farther up the\r\nvalley, it raises them to within 40 or 60 feet of the surface.\r\n\r\nThe Tertiary district thus appears, on a general view, to be divided\r\nnaturally into four portions by lines running nearly north and south,\r\nthe former line passing immediately south, and the latter east of\r\nLondon, which stands at the south-east corner of the north-western\r\ndivision, and consequently it must not be viewed as the centre of one\r\nlarge and unbroken area, so far as the Tertiary strata are concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE NEW RED SANDSTONE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis formation has been already alluded to at pp. 5 and 8; it is, next\r\nto the chalk and lower greensand, the most extensive source of water\r\nsupply from wells we have in England, and although the two formations\r\nmentioned occupy a larger area, yet, owing to geographical position, the\r\nnew red sandstone receives a more considerable quantity of rainfall,\r\nand, owing to the comparative scarceness of carbonate of lime, yields\r\nsofter water.\r\n\r\nThe new red sandstone is called on the Continent \"the Trias,\" as in\r\nGermany and parts of France it presents a distinct threefold division.\r\nAlthough the names of each of the divisions are commonly used, they are\r\nin themselves local and unessential, as the same exact relations between\r\nthem do not occur in other remote parts of Europe or in England, and are\r\nnot to be looked for in distant continents. The names of the divisions\r\nand their English equivalents are:\r\n\r\n  1. Keuper, or red marls.\r\n\r\n  2. Muschelkalk, or shell limestones (not found in this country).\r\n\r\n  3. Bunter sandstone, or variegated sandstone.\r\n\r\nThe strata consist in general of red, mottled, purple, or yellowish\r\nsandstones and marls, with beds of rock-salt, gypsum pebbles, and\r\nconglomerate.\r\n\r\nThe region over which triassic rocks outcrop in England stretches across\r\nthe island from a point in the south-western part of the English Channel\r\nabout Exmouth, Devon, north-north-eastward, and also from the centre of\r\nthis band along a north-westward course to Liverpool, thence dividing\r\nand running north-east to the Tees, and north-west to Solway Firth.\r\n\r\nIn central Europe the trias is found largely developed, and in North\r\nAmerica it covers an area whose aggregate length is some 700 or 800\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nThe beds, in England, may be divided as follows;\r\n\r\n                                               Average Thickness.\r\n  KEUPER--Red marls, with rock-salt and gypsum      1000 ft.\r\n          Lower Keuper sandstones, with trias\r\n            sandstones and marls (waterstones)       250 ft.\r\n          Dolomitic conglomerate\r\n\r\n  BUNTER--Upper red and mottled sandstone            300 ft.\r\n          Pebble beds, or uncompacted conglomerate   300 ft.\r\n          Lower red and mottled sandstone            250 ft.\r\n\r\nThe Keuper series is introduced by a conglomerate often calcareous,\r\npassing up into brown, yellow, or white freestone, and then into thinly\r\nlaminated sandstones and marls. The other subdivisions are remarkably\r\nuniform in character, except in the case of the pebble beds, which in\r\nthe north-west form a light red pebbly building stone, but in the\r\ncentral counties becomes generally an unconsolidated conglomerate of\r\nquartzose pebbles.\r\n\r\nThe following tabulated form, due to Edward Hull, Esq., M.A., shows the\r\ncomparative thickness and range of the Triassic series along a\r\nsouth-easterly direction from the estuary of the Mersey, and also shows\r\nthe thinning away of all the Triassic strata from the north-west towards\r\nthe south-east of England, which Hull was amongst the first to\r\ndemonstrate.\r\n\r\nTHICKNESS AND RANGE OF THE TRIAS IN A S.E.

In the\r\nneighbourhood of Liverpool the rock, or at least the pebble bed, is less\r\nporous than in the neighbourhood of Whitmore, Nottingham, and other\r\nparts of the midland counties, where it becomes either an unconsolidated\r\nconglomerate or a soft crumbly sandstone. Yet wells sunk even in the\r\nhard building stone of the pebble beds, either in Cheshire or\r\nLancashire, always yield water at a certain variable depth. Beyond a\r\ncertain depth the water tends to decrease, as was the case in the St.\r\nHelen's public well, situated on Eccleston Hill. At this well an attempt\r\nwas made, in 1868, to increase the supply by boring deeper into the\r\nsandstone, but without any good result. When water percolates downwards\r\nin the rock we may suppose there are two forces of an antagonistic\r\ncharacter brought into play; there is the force of friction, increasing\r\nwith the depth, and tending to hinder the downward progress of the\r\nwater, while there is the hydrostatic pressure tending to force the\r\nwater downwards; and we may suppose that when equilibrium has been\r\nestablished between these two forces, the further percolation will\r\ncease.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of rain which finds it way into the rock in some parts of\r\nthe country must be very large. When the rock, as is generally the case\r\nin Lancashire, Cheshire, and Shropshire, is partly overspread by a\r\ncoating of dense boulder clay, almost impervious to water, the quantity\r\nprobably does not exceed one-third of the rainfall over a considerable\r\narea; but in some parts of the midland counties, where the rock is very\r\nopen, and the covering of drift scanty or altogether absent, the\r\npercolation amounts to a much larger proportion, probably one-half or\r\ntwo-thirds, as all the rain which is not evaporated passes downwards.\r\nThe new red sandstone, as remarked, may be regarded, in respect to\r\nwater supply, as a nearly homogeneous mass, equally available\r\nthroughout; and it is owing to this structure, and the almost entire\r\nabsence of beds of impervious clay or marl, that the formation is\r\ncapable of affording such large supplies of water; for the rain which\r\nfalls on its surface and penetrates into the rock is free to pass in any\r\ndirection towards a well when sunk in a central position. If we consider\r\nthe rock as a mass completely saturated with water through a certain\r\nvertical depth, the water being in a state of equilibrium, when a well\r\nis sunk, and the water pumped up, the state of equilibrium is destroyed,\r\nand the water in the rock is forced in from all sides. The percolation\r\nis, doubtless, much facilitated by joints, fissures, and faults, and in\r\ncases where one side of a fault is composed of impervious strata, such\r\nas the Keuper marls, or coal measures, the quantity of water pent up\r\nagainst the face of the fault may be very large, and the position often\r\nfavourable for a well. An instance of the effect of faults in the rock\r\nitself, in increasing the supply, is afforded in the case of the well at\r\nFlaybrick Hill, near Birkenhead. From the bottom of this well a heading\r\nwas driven at a depth of about 160 feet from the surface, to cut a fault\r\nabout 150 feet distant, and upon this having been effected the water\r\nflowed in with such impetuosity that the supply, which had been 400,000\r\ngallons a day, was at once doubled.\r\n\r\nThe water from the new red sandstone is clear, wholesome, and pleasant\r\nto drink; it is also well adapted for the purposes of bleaching, dyeing,\r\nand brewing; at the same time it must be admitted that its qualities as\r\nregards hardness, in other words, the proportions of carbonates of limes\r\nand magnesia it contains, are subject to considerable variation,\r\ndepending on the locality and composition of the rock. As a general\r\nrule, the water from the new red sandstone may be considered as\r\noccupying a position intermediate between the _hard_ water of the chalk,\r\nand the _soft_ water supplied to some of our large towns from the\r\ndrainage of mountainous tracts of the primary formations, of which the\r\nwater supplied from Loch Katrine to Glasgow is perhaps the purest\r\nexample, containing only 2·35 grains of solid matter to the gallon.\r\nHaving besides but a small proportion of saline ingredients, which,\r\nwhile they tend to harden the water, are probably not without benefit in\r\nthe animal economy, the water supply from the new red sandstone\r\npossesses incalculable advantages over that from rivers and surface\r\ndrainage. Many of our large towns are now partially or entirely supplied\r\nwith water pumped from deep wells in this sandstone; and several from\r\ncopious springs gushing forth from the rock at its junction with some\r\nunderlying impervious stratum belonging to the primary series.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nWELL SINKING.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrevious to sinking it will be necessary to have in readiness a stock of\r\nbuckets, shovels, picks, rope, a pulley-block or a windlass, and barrows\r\nor other means of conveying the material extracted away from the mouth\r\nof the sinking. After all the preliminary arrangements have been made,\r\nthe sinking is commenced by marking off a circle upon the ground 12 or\r\n18 inches greater in circumference than the intended internal diameter\r\nof the well. The centre of the well as commenced from must be the centre\r\nof every part of the sinking; its position must be carefully preserved,\r\nand everything that is done must be true to this centre, the plumb-line\r\nbeing frequently used to test the vertical position of the sides.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Drum Curb Plan.\r\n\r\nFig. 17.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Drum Curb Section.\r\n\r\nFig. 18.]\r\n\r\nTo sink a well by underpinning, an excavation is first made to such a\r\ndepth as the strata will allow without falling in. At the bottom of the\r\nexcavation is laid a curb, that is, a flat ring, whose internal diameter\r\nis equal to the intended clear diameter of the well, and its breadth\r\nequal to the thickness of the brickwork. It is made of oak or elm planks\r\n3 or 4 inches thick, either in one layer fished at the joints with iron,\r\nor in two layers breaking joint, and spiked or screwed together. On\r\nthis, to line the first division of the well, a cylinder of brickwork,\r\ntechnically called steining, is built in mortar or cement. In the centre\r\nof the floor is dug a small pit, at the bottom of which is laid a small\r\nplatform of boards; then, by cutting notches in the side of the pit,\r\nraking props are inserted, their lower ends abutting against a foot\r\nblock, and their upper ends against the lowest setting, so as to give\r\ntemporary support to the curb with its load of brickwork. The pit is\r\nenlarged to the diameter of the shaft above; on the bottom of the\r\nexcavation is laid a new curb, on which is built a new division of the\r\nbrickwork, giving permanent support to the upper curb; the raking props\r\nand their foot-blocks are removed; a new pit is dug, and so on as\r\nbefore. Care should be taken that the earth is firmly packed behind the\r\nsteining.\r\n\r\nA common modification of this method consists in excavating to such a\r\ndepth as the strata will admit without falling in. A wooden curb is laid\r\nat the bottom of the excavation, the brick steining laid upon it and\r\ncarried to the surface. The earth is then excavated flush with the\r\ninterior sides of the well, so that the earth underneath the curb\r\nsupports the brickwork above. When the excavation has been carried on as\r\nfar as convenient, recesses are made in the earth under the previous\r\nsteining, and in these recesses the steining is carried up to the\r\nprevious work. When thus supported the intermediate portions of earth\r\nbetween the sections of brickwork carried up are cut away and the\r\nsteining completed.\r\n\r\nIn sinking with a drum curb, the curb, which may be either of wood or\r\niron, consists of a flat ring for supporting the steining, and of a\r\nvertical hollow cylinder or drum of the same outside diameter as the\r\nsteining, supporting the ring within it and bevelled to a sharp edge\r\nbelow. The rings, or ribs, of a wooden curb are formed of two\r\nthicknesses of elm plank, 1-1/2 inch thick by 9 inches wide, giving a\r\ntotal thickness of 3 inches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Iron Drum Curb Plan.\r\n\r\nFig. 19.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Iron Curb Enlarged Segment.\r\n\r\nFig. 20.]\r\n\r\nFig. 17 is a plan of a wooden drum curb, and Fig. 18 a section showing\r\nthe mode of construction. The outside cylinder or drum is termed the\r\nlagging, and is commonly made from 1-1/2-inch yellow pine planks. The\r\ndrum may be strengthened if necessary by additional rings, and its\r\nconnections with the rings made more secure by brackets. In large curbs\r\nthe rings are placed about 3 feet 6 inches apart. Fig. 19 is a plan, and\r\nFig. 20 an enlarged segment of an iron curb. When the well has been sunk\r\nas far as the earth will stand vertical, the drum curb is lowered into\r\nit and the building of the brick cylinder commenced, care being taken to\r\ncomplete each course of bricks before laying another, in order that the\r\ncurb may be loaded equally all round. The earth is dug away from the\r\ninterior of the drum, and this, together with the gradually increasing\r\nload, causes the sharp lower edge of the drum to sink into the earth;\r\nand thus the digging of the well at the bottom, the sinking of the drum\r\ncurb and the brick lining which it carries, and the building of the\r\nsteining at the top, go on together. Care must be taken in this, as in\r\nevery other method, to regulate the digging so that the well shall sink\r\nvertically. Should the friction of the earth against the outside of the\r\nwell at length become so great as to stop its descent before the\r\nrequisite depth is attained, a smaller well may be sunk in the interior\r\nof the first well. A well so stopped is said to be earth-fast. This plan\r\ncannot be applied to deep wells, but is very successful in sandy soils\r\nwhere the well is of moderate depth.\r\n\r\nThe curbs are often supported by iron rods, fitted with screws and nuts,\r\nfrom cross timbers over the mouth of the well, and as the excavation is\r\ncarried on below, brickwork is piled on above, and the weight of the\r\nsteining will carry it down as the excavation proceeds, until the\r\nfriction of the sides overpowers the gravitating force or weight of the\r\nsteining, when it becomes earth-bound; then a set-off must be made in\r\nthe well, and the same operation repeated as often as the steining\r\nbecomes earth-bound, or the work must be completed by the first method\r\nof underpinning.\r\n\r\nWhen the rock to be sunk through is unstratified, or if stratified, when\r\nof great thickness, recourse must be had to the action of explosive\r\nagents. The explosives most frequently used for this purpose are\r\nguncotton, dynamite, lithofracteur, and gunpowder. Lithofracteur is now\r\noften employed, and always with considerable success, as its power is\r\nsimilar to that of dynamite, but, what is particularly important in\r\nvertical bore-holes, its action is intensely local; it is, moreover,\r\nsafe, does not generate fumes more harmful than ordinary gunpowder,\r\nrequires smaller holes, and but little tamping. The dangerous character\r\nof guncotton has hitherto prevented its adoption for ordinary\r\noperations, while the comparatively safe character and convenient form\r\nof gunpowder have commended it to the confidence of workmen, and hence\r\nfor sinking operations this explosive is generally employed. We shall\r\ntherefore, in treating of blasting for well sinking, consider these\r\noperations as carried out by the aid of gunpowder alone.\r\n\r\nThe system of blasting employed in well sinking is that known as the\r\nsmall-shot system, which consists in boring holes from 1 to 3 inches\r\ndiameter in the rock to be disrupted to receive the charge. The position\r\nof these holes is a matter of the highest importance from the point of\r\nview of producing the greatest effects with the available means, and to\r\ndetermine them properly requires a complete knowledge of the nature of\r\nthe forces developed by an explosive agent. This knowledge is rarely\r\npossessed by sinkers. Indeed, such is the ignorance of this subject\r\ndisplayed by quarrymen generally, that when the proportioning and\r\nplacing the charges are left to their judgment, a large expenditure of\r\nlabour and material will produce very inadequate results. In all cases\r\nit is far more economical to entrust these duties to one who thoroughly\r\nunderstands the subject. The following principles should govern all\r\noperations of this nature.\r\n\r\nThe explosion of gunpowder, by the expansion of the gases suddenly\r\nevolved, develops an enormous force, and this force, due to the pressure\r\nof a fluid, is exerted equally in all directions. Consequently, the\r\nsurrounding mass subjected to this force will yield, if it yield at all,\r\nin its weakest part, that is, in the part which offers least resistance.\r\nThe line along which the mass yields, or line of rupture, is called the\r\nline of least resistance, and is the distance traversed by the gases\r\nbefore reaching the surface. When the surrounding mass is uniformly\r\nresisting, the line of least resistance will be a straight line, and\r\nwill be the shortest distance from the centre of the charge to the\r\nsurface. Such, however, is rarely the case, and the line of rupture will\r\ntherefore in most instances be an irregular line, and often much longer\r\nthan that from the centre direct to the surface. Hence in all blasting\r\noperations there will be two things to determine, the line of least\r\nresistance and the quantity of powder requisite to overcome the\r\nresistance along that line. For it is obvious that all excess of powder\r\nis waste; and, moreover, as the force developed by this excess must be\r\nexpended upon something, it will probably be employed in doing mischief.\r\nCharges of powder of uniform strength produce effects varying with their\r\nweight, that is, a double charge will move a double mass. And as\r\nhomogeneous masses vary as the cube of any similar line within them, the\r\ngeneral rule is established that charges of powder to produce similar\r\nresults are to each other as the cubes of the lines of least resistance.\r\nHence when the charge requisite to produce a given effect in a\r\nparticular substance has been determined by experiment, that necessary\r\nto produce a like effect in a given mass of the same substance may be\r\nreadily determined. As the substances to be acted upon are various and\r\ndiffer in tenacity in different localities, and as, moreover, the\r\nquality of powder varies greatly, it will be necessary, in undertaking\r\nsinking operations, to make experiments in order to determine the\r\nconstant which should be employed in calculating the charges of powder.\r\nIn practice, the line of least resistance is taken as the shortest\r\ndistance from the centre of the charge to the surface of the rock,\r\nunless the existence of natural divisions shows it to lie in some other\r\ndirection; and, generally, the charge requisite to overcome the\r\nresistance will vary from 1/15 to 1/35 of the cube of the line, the\r\nlatter being taken in feet and the former in pounds. Thus, suppose the\r\nmaterial to be blasted is chalk, and the line of least resistance 4\r\nfeet, the cube of 4 is 64, and taking the proportion for chalk as 1/30,\r\nwe have 64/30 = 2-2/15 lb. as the charge necessary to produce\r\ndisruption.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Jumper.\r\n\r\nFig. 21.]\r\n\r\nWhen the blasting is in stratified rock, the position of the charge will\r\nfrequently be determined by the natural divisions and fissures; for if\r\nthese are not duly taken into consideration, the sinker will have the\r\nmortification of finding, after his shot has been fired, that the\r\nelastic gases have found an easier vent through one of these flaws, and\r\nthat consequently no useful effect has been produced. The line of least\r\nresistance, in this case, will generally be perpendicular to the beds of\r\nthe strata, so that the hole for the charge may be driven parallel to\r\nthe strata and in such a position as not to touch the planes which\r\nseparate them. This hole should never be driven in the direction of the\r\nline of least resistance, and when practicable should be at right-angles\r\nto it.\r\n\r\nThe instruments employed in boring the holes for the shot are iron rods\r\nhaving a wedge-shaped piece of steel welded to their lower ends and\r\nbrought to an edge so as to cut into the rock. These are worked either\r\nby striking them on the head with a hammer, or by jumping them up and\r\ndown and allowing them to penetrate by their own weight. When used in\r\nthe former manner they are called borers or drills; in the latter case\r\nthey are of the form Fig. 21, and are termed jumpers. Recently power\r\njumpers worked by compressed air, and drills actuated in the same manner\r\nhave been very successfully employed. Holes may be made by these\r\ninstruments in almost any direction; but when hand labour only is\r\navailable, the vertical can be most advantageously worked. Hand-jumpers\r\nare usually about 4 feet 8 inches in length, and are used by holding in\r\nthe direction of the required hole, and producing a series of sharp\r\nblows through lifting the tool about a foot high and dropping it with an\r\nimpulsive movement. The bead divides a jumper into two unequal lengths,\r\nof which the shorter is used for commencing a bore-hole, and the longer\r\nfor finishing it. Often the bit on the long length is made a trifle\r\nsmaller than the other to remove any chance of its not following into\r\nthe hole which has been commenced.\r\n\r\nDrills and jumpers should be made of the best iron, preferably Swedish,\r\nfor if the material be of an inferior quality it will split and turn\r\nover under the repeated blows of the mall, and thus endanger the hands\r\nof the workman who turns it, or give off splinters that may cause\r\nserious injury to those engaged in the shaft. Frequently they are made\r\nentirely of steel, and this material has much to recommend it for this\r\npurpose; the length of drills varies from 18 inches to 4 feet, the\r\ndifferent lengths being put in successively as the sinking of the hole\r\nprogresses. The cutting edge of the drills should be well steeled, and\r\nfor the first, or 18-inch drill, have generally a breadth of 2 inches;\r\nthe second, or 28-inch drill, may be 1-3/4 inch on the edge; the third,\r\nor 3-foot drill, 1-1/2 inch, and the fourth, or 4-foot drill, 1-1/4\r\ninch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Funnel and Pipe for Shot-hole Acid Pouring.\r\n\r\nFig. 22.]\r\n\r\nThe mode of using the drill in the latter case is as follows; The place\r\nfor the hole having been marked off with the pick, one man sits down\r\nholding the drill in both hands between his legs. Another man then\r\nstrikes the drill with a mall, the former turning the drill partially\r\nround between each blow to prevent the cutting edge from falling twice\r\nin the same place.\r\n\r\nThe speed with which holes may be sunk varies of course with the\r\nhardness of the rock and the diameter of the hole. At Holyhead the\r\naverage work done by three men in hard quartz rock with 1-1/2-inch\r\ndrills was 14 inches an hour; one man holding the drill, and two\r\nstriking. In granite of good quality, it has been ascertained by\r\nexperience that three men are able to sink with a 3-inch jumper 4 feet\r\nin a day; with a 2-1/2-inch jumper, 5 feet; with a 2-1/4-inch, 6 feet;\r\nwith a 2-inch, 8 feet; and with a 1-3/4-inch, 12 feet. A strong man with\r\na 1-inch jumper will bore 8 feet in a day. The weight of the hammers\r\nused with drills is a matter deserving attention; for if too heavy they\r\nfatigue the men, and consequently fewer blows are given and the effect\r\nproduced lessened; while, on the other hand, if too light, the strength\r\nof the workman is not fully employed. The usual weight is from 5 to 7\r\nlb.\r\n\r\nAs the labour of boring a shot-hole in a given kind of rock is dependent\r\non the diameter, it is obviously desirable to make the hole as small as\r\npossible, due regard being had to the size of the charge; for it must be\r\nborne in mind in determining the diameter of the boring that the charge\r\nshould not occupy a great length in it. Various expedients have been\r\nresorted to for the purpose of enlarging the hole at the bottom so as to\r\nform a chamber for the powder. If this could be easily effected, such a\r\nmode of placing the charge would be highly advantageous, as a very small\r\nbore-hole would be sufficient, and the difficulties of tamping much\r\nlessened. One of these expedients is to place a small charge at the\r\nbottom of the bore and to fire it after being properly tamped. The\r\ncharge being insufficient to cause fracture, the parts in immediate\r\ncontact with it are compressed and crushed to dust, and the cavity is\r\nthereby enlarged. The proper charge may then be inserted in the chamber\r\nthus formed by boring through the tamping. Another method, applicable\r\nchiefly to calcareous rock, has been tried with satisfactory results at\r\nMarseilles. When the bore-hole has been sunk to the required depth, a\r\ncopper pipe, Fig. 22, of a diameter to fit the bore loosely, is\r\nintroduced, the end A reaching to the bottom of the hole, which is\r\nclosed up tight at B with clay so that no air may escape. The pipe is\r\nprovided with a bent neck C. A small leaden pipe _e_, about half an inch\r\nin diameter, with a funnel _f_ at the top, is introduced into the copper\r\npipe at D and passed down to within about an inch of the bottom. The\r\nannular space between the leaden and copper pipes at _g_ is filled with\r\na packing of hemp. Dilute nitric acid is then poured through the funnel\r\nand leaden pipe. The acid dissolves the calcareous rock at the bottom,\r\ncausing an effervescence, and a substance containing the dissolved lime\r\nis forced out of the orifice C. This process is continued until from the\r\nquantity of acid consumed it is judged that the chamber is sufficiently\r\nenlarged. Other acids, such as muriatic or sulphuric, will produce the\r\nsame effects, but the result of the chemical solution will of course\r\ndepend upon the nature of the stone.\r\n\r\nAfter the shot-hole has been bored, it is cleaned out and dried with a\r\nwisp of hay, and the powder poured down; or, when the hole is not\r\nvertical, pushed in with a wooden rammer. The quantity of powder should\r\nalways be determined by weight. One pound, when loosely poured out, will\r\noccupy about 30 cubic inches, and 1 cubic foot weighs 57 pounds. A hole\r\n1 inch in diameter will therefore contain ·414 ounce for every inch of\r\ndepth. Hence to find the weight of powder to an inch of depth in any\r\ngiven hole, we have only to multiply ·414 ounce by the square of the\r\ndiameter of the hole in inches, and we are enabled to determine either\r\nthe length of hole for a given charge, or the charge in a given space.\r\nIt is important to use strong powder in blasting operations, because, as\r\na smaller quantity will be sufficient, it will occupy less space, and\r\nthereby save labour in boring.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Clay Iron.\r\n\r\nFigs. 24, 25.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pricker.\r\n\r\nFig. 23.]\r\n\r\nWhen the hole is in wet stone, means must be provided for keeping the\r\npowder dry. For this purpose, tin cartridges are sometimes used. These\r\nare tin cylinders of suitable dimensions, fitted with a small tin stem\r\nthrough which the powder is ignited. The effect of the powder is,\r\nhowever, much lessened by the use of these tin cases. Generally a paper\r\ncartridge, well greased to prevent the water from penetrating, will give\r\nfar more satisfactory results. When the paper shot is used, the hole\r\nshould, previous to the insertion of the charge, be partially filled\r\nwith stiff clay, and a round iron bar, called a clay-iron or bull, Figs.\r\n24, 25, driven down to force the clay into the interstices of the rock\r\nthrough which the water enters. By this means the hole will be kept\r\ncomparatively dry. The bull is withdrawn by placing a bar through the\r\neye near the top of the former, provided for that purpose, and lifting\r\nit straight out. The cartridge is placed upon the point of a pricker and\r\npushed down the hole. The pricker, shown in Fig. 23, is a taper piece of\r\nmetal, usually of copper to prevent accidents, pointed at one end and\r\nhaving a ring at the other. When the cartridge has been placed in its\r\nposition by this means, a little oakum is laid over it, and a Bickford\r\nfuse inserted. This fuse is inexpensive, very certain in its effects,\r\nnot easily injured by tamping, and is unaffected by moisture. The No. 8\r\nfuse is preferred for wet ground; and when it is required to fire the\r\ncharge from the bottom in deep holes, No. 18 is the most suitable.\r\n\r\nWhen the line of least resistance has been decided upon, care must be\r\ntaken that it remains the line of least resistance; for if the space in\r\nbore-hole is not properly filled, the elastic gases may find an easier\r\nvent in that direction than in any other. The materials employed to fill\r\nthis space are, when so applied, called tamping, and they consist of the\r\nchips and dust from the sinking, sand, well-dried clay, or broken brick\r\nor stones. Various opinions are held concerning the relative value of\r\nthese materials as tamping. Sand offers very great resistance from the\r\nfriction of the particles amongst themselves and against the sides of\r\nthe bore-hole; it may be easily applied by pouring it in, and is always\r\nreadily obtainable. Clay, if thoroughly baked, offers a somewhat greater\r\nresistance than sand, and, where readily procurable, may be\r\nadvantageously employed. Broken stone is much inferior to either of\r\nthese substances in resisting power. The favour in which it is held by\r\nsinkers and quarrymen, and the frequent use they make of it as tamping,\r\nmust be attributed to the fact of its being always ready to hand, rather\r\nthan to any excellent results obtained from its use. The tamping is\r\nforced down with a stemmer or tamping bar similar to Figs. 26, 27, too\r\nfrequently made of iron, but which should be either of copper or bronze.\r\nThe tamping end of the bar is grooved on one side, to admit of its\r\nclearing the pricker, or the fuse, lying along the side of the hole. The\r\nother end is left plain for the hand or for being struck with a hammer.\r\n\r\nAll tamping should be selected for its freedom from particles likely to\r\nstrike fire, but it must not be overlooked that the cause of such a\r\ncasualty may lie in the sides of the hole itself. Under these\r\ncircumstances is seen the advisability of using bronze or copper tamping\r\ntools, and of not hammering violently on the tamping until a little of\r\nit has been first gently pressed down to cover over the charge, because\r\nthe earlier blows on the tamping are the most dangerous in the event of\r\na spark occurring. A little wadding, tow, paper, or a wooden plug is\r\nsometimes put to lie against the charge before any tamping is placed in\r\nthe hole.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tamping Bar.\r\n\r\nFigs. 26, 27.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Metal Cone Plug.\r\n\r\nFig. 28.]\r\n\r\nTo lessen the danger of the tamping being blown out, plugs or cones of\r\nmetal of different shapes are sometimes inserted in the hole. The best\r\nforms of plug are shown in Figs. 28 and 29; Fig. 28 is a metal cone\r\nwedged in on the tamping with arrows, and Fig. 29 is a barrel-shaped\r\nplug.\r\n\r\nWhen all is ready, the sinkers, with the exception of one man whose duty\r\nit is to fire the charge, are either drawn out of the shaft, or are\r\nremoved to some place of safety. This man then, having ascertained by\r\ncalling and receiving a reply that all are under shelter, applies a\r\nlight to the fuse, shouts \"Bend away,\" or some equivalent expression,\r\nand is rapidly drawn up the shaft.\r\n\r\nTo avoid shattering the walls of a shaft, no shot should be placed\r\nnearer the side than 12 inches. The portion of stone next the wall sides\r\nof the shaft left after blasting is removed by steel-tipped iron wedges\r\n7 or 8 inches in length. These wedges are applied by making a small hole\r\nwith the point of the pick and driving them in with a mall. The sides\r\nmay be then dressed as required with the pick.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Barrel Shaped Plug.\r\n\r\nFig. 29.]\r\n\r\nAfter some 30 or 40 feet have been sunk the air at the bottom of the\r\nwell may be very foul, especially in a well where blasting operations\r\nare being carried on, or where there is any great escape of noxious\r\ngases through fissures. Means must then be provided for applying at the\r\nsurface a small exhaust fan to which is attached lengths of tubing\r\nextending down the well. Another good plan is to pass a 4 or 6 inch pipe\r\ndown the well, bring it up with a long bend at surface, and insert a\r\nsteam jet; a brick chimney is frequently built over the upper end of the\r\npipe to increase the draught, and the lower end continued down with\r\nflexible tubing. With either fan or steam jet, the foul air being\r\ncontinuously withdrawn, fresh air will rush down in its place. This is\r\nfar better than dashing lime-water down the well, using a long wooden\r\npipe with a revolving caphead, or pouring down a vertical pipe water\r\nwhich escaped at right-angles, the old expedients for freshening the air\r\nin a well.\r\n\r\nA means of increasing the yield of wells, which is frequently very\r\nsuccessful, is to drive small tunnels or headings from the bottom of the\r\nwell into the surrounding water-bearing stratum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30.\r\n\r\nSectional Plan.\r\n\r\nWater-bearing Stratum.]\r\n\r\nAs an example, let Fig. 30 represent a sectional plan of a portion of\r\nthe water-bearing stratum at the bottom of the shaft. This stratum is\r\nunderlaid by an impervious stratum, and, consequently, the water will\r\nflow continuously through the former in the direction of the dip, as\r\nshown by the arrow and the dotted lines. That portion of the stratum to\r\nthe rise of the shaft, S, which is included within vertical lines\r\ntangent to the circle at the points _m_ and _n_, will be drained by the\r\nshaft. The breadth of this portion will, however, be extended beyond\r\nthese lines by the relief to the lateral pressure afforded by the shaft,\r\nwhich relief will cause the fillets of water to diverge from their\r\noriginal course towards the shaft, as shown in the figure. Hence the\r\nbreadth of drainage ground will be _a b_, and it is evident that the\r\nshaft, S, can receive only that water which descends towards it through\r\nthis space. But if tunnels be driven from the shaft along the strike of\r\nthe stratum, as at _m c_, _n d_, these tunnels will obviously intercept\r\nthe water which flows past the shaft. By this means the drainage ground\r\nis extended from _a b_ to _a´ b´_, and the yield of the well\r\nproportionately increased.\r\n\r\nIt should be remarked that when the strata is horizontal or depressed in\r\nthe form of a basin, that is, when it partakes more of the character of\r\na _reservoir_ than a _stream_, the only use of tunnels is to facilitate\r\nthe ingress of water into the shaft, and in such case they should\r\nradiate from the shaft in all directions. They are also of service in\r\ncase of accident to the pumps, as the time they take to fill up allows\r\nof examination and repairs being made in that time to the pumps, which\r\ncould not be got at if the engines stopped pumping and the water rose\r\nrapidly up the shaft.\r\n\r\nThe size of the headings is usually limited by the least dimensions of\r\nthe space in which miners can work efficiently, that is about 4-1/2 feet\r\nhigh and 3 feet wide. The horse-shoe form is generally adopted for the\r\nsides and top, the floor being level, for the drawing off of the water\r\nby the pumps is quite sufficient to cause a flow, unless of course the\r\ndip of the stratum in which the tunnels are driven is such as to warrant\r\nan inclination. Where there is any water it is not possible to drive\r\nthem with a fall, for the men would be drowned out.\r\n\r\nThe cost of some headings in the new red sandstone which the writer\r\nrecently inspected, varied from 30_s._ a yard in ordinary stone, to\r\n4_l._ 10_s._ a yard in very hard stone.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing remarks do not apply to headings driven in the chalk,\r\nwhere it is the usual practice to select the largest feeder issuing from\r\na fissure and follow that fissure up, unless the heading is merely to\r\nserve as a reservoir, when the direction is immaterial.\r\n\r\nThe sides of wells usually require lining or steining, as it is termed,\r\nwith some material that will prevent the loose strata of the sides of\r\nthe excavation falling into the well and choking it. The materials that\r\nhave been successfully used in this work are brick, stone, timber, and\r\niron. Each description of material is suitable under certain conditions,\r\nwhile in other positions it is objectionable. Brickwork, which is\r\nuniversally used in steining wells in England, not unfrequently fails in\r\ncertain positions; through admitting impure water when such water is\r\nunder great pressure, or from the work becoming disjointed from\r\nsettlement due to the draining of a running sand-bed, or the collapse of\r\nthe well. Stone of fair quality, capable of withstanding compressive\r\nstrains, is good in its way; but, inasmuch as it requires a great deal\r\nof labour to fit it for its place, it cannot successfully compete with\r\nbrickwork in the formation of wells, more especially as it has no merits\r\nsuperior to those of brick when used in such work; however, if in any\r\nlocality, by reason of its cheapness, it can be used, care should be\r\ntaken to select only such as contains a large amount of silica; indeed,\r\nin all cases it is a point of great importance in studying the nature of\r\nthe materials used in the construction of wells, to select those which\r\nare likely to be the most durable, and at the same time preserve the\r\npurity of the water contained in the well; and this is best secured by\r\nsilicious materials.\r\n\r\nTimber is objectionable as a material to be used in the lining of wells,\r\non account of its liability to decay, when it not only endangers the\r\nconstruction of the well, but also to some extent fouls the water. It is\r\nvery largely used under some circumstances, especially in the\r\npreliminary operations in sinking most wells. It is also successfully\r\nused in lining the shafts of the salt wells of Cheshire, and will\r\ncontinue entire in such a position for a great number of years, as the\r\nbrine seems to have a tendency to preserve the timber and prevent its\r\ndecay. Iron is of modern application, and is a material extensively\r\nemployed in steining wells; and, as it possesses many advantages over\r\nmaterials ordinarily used, its use is likely to be much extended. It is\r\ncapable of bearing great compressive strains, and of effectually\r\nexcluding the influx of all such waters as it may be desirable to keep\r\nout, and is not liable to decay under ordinary circumstances. Baldwin\r\nLatham mentions instances in his practice where recourse has been had to\r\nthe use of iron cylinders, when it was found that four or five rings of\r\nbrickwork, set in the best cement, failed to keep out brackish waters;\r\nand, if the original design had provided for the introduction of these\r\ncylinders, it would have reduced the cost of the well very materially.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plan at Top_\r\n\r\nFig. 31.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Elevation.\r\n\r\nFig. 32.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plan at Bottom_\r\n\r\nFig. 33.]\r\n\r\nThe well-sinker has often, in executing his work, to contend with the\r\npresence of large volumes of water, which, under ordinary circumstances,\r\nmust be got rid of by pumping; but by the introduction of iron\r\ncylinders, which can be sunk under water, the consequent expense of\r\npumping is saved.\r\n\r\nWhen sinking these cylinders through water-bearing strata, various tools\r\nare used to remove the soil from beneath them. The principal is the\r\nmizer, which consists of an iron cylinder with an opening on the side\r\nand a cutting lip, and which is attached to a set of boring rods and\r\nturned from above.\r\n\r\nThe valve in the old form of mizer is subject to various accidents which\r\ninterfere with the action of the tool; for instance, pieces of hard soil\r\nor rock often lodge between the valve and its seat, allowing the\r\ncontents to run out whilst it is being raised through water. To remedy\r\nthis defect the eminent well-sinker, Thomas Docwra, designed and\r\nintroduced the improved mizer, shown of the usual dimensions in Figs. 31\r\nto 36; Fig. 31 being a plan at top, Fig. 32 an elevation, Fig. 33 a plan\r\nat bottom, Fig. 35 a section, Fig. 34 a plan of the stop _a_, and Fig.\r\n36 a plan of the valve. It consists of an iron cylinder, conical shaped\r\nat bottom, furnished with holes for the escape of water, and attached to\r\na central shank by means of stays. The shank extends some 7 inches\r\nbeyond the bottom, and ends in a point, while the upper part of the\r\nshank has an open slot, to form a box-joint, Figs. 37 to 39, with the\r\nrods. The conical bottom of the mizer has a triangular-shaped opening;\r\non the outside of this is fitted a strong iron cutter, and on the inside\r\na properly-shaped valve, seen in section and plan in Figs. 35 and 36.\r\nWhen the mizer is attached to and turned by means of the boring rods,\r\nthe _débris_, sand, or other soil to be removed, being turned up by the\r\nlip of the cutter, enters the cylinder, the valve, whilst the mizer is\r\nfilling, resting against a stop. After the mizer is charged, which can\r\nbe ascertained by placing a mark upon the last rod at surface and noting\r\nits progress downwards, the rods are reversed and turned once or twice\r\nin a backward direction; this forces the valve over the opening and\r\nretains the soil safely in the tool.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plan of the Stop.\r\n\r\nFig. 34.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Section.\r\n\r\nFig. 35.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plan of the Valve.\r\n\r\nFig. 36.]\r\n\r\nFig. 40 is a pot mizer occasionally used in such soils as clay mixed\r\nwith pebbles; there is no valve, as the soil is forced upwards by the\r\nworm on the outside, and falls over the edge into the cone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Box Joint.\r\n\r\nFigs. 37-39.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pot Mizer.\r\n\r\nFig. 40.]\r\n\r\nMizers are fastened to the rods by means of the box-joint, shown in\r\nFigs. 37 to 39, as a screw-joint would come apart on reversing.\r\n\r\nAs many as five or six different sized mizers, ranging from 1 foot 6\r\ninches to 9 feet in diameter, can be used successively, the smallest\r\ncommencing the excavation, and the larger ones enlarging it until it is\r\nof the requisite size.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Picker.\r\n\r\nFigs. 41-43.]\r\n\r\nAs an accessory, a picker, shown by the three views, Figs. 41 to 43,\r\nFig. 42 indicating its correct position when in operation, is employed\r\nwhere the strata is too irregular or compact to be effectually cleared\r\naway by the cutter of the mizer. The picker is fixed upon the same rods\r\nabove the mizer, and is used simultaneously, being raised and lowered\r\nwith that tool.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Scratcher.\r\n\r\nFigs. 44, 45.]\r\n\r\nThe cutting end of the picker is frequently replaced by a scratcher,\r\nFigs. 44, 45. This useful tool rakes or scratches up the _débris_ thrown\r\nby the mizer beyond its own working range, and causes it to accumulate\r\nin the centre of the sinking, where it is again subjected to the action\r\nof the mizer.\r\n\r\nBrick steining is executed either in bricks laid dry or in cement, in\r\nordinary clay 9-inch work being used for large wells, and half-brick, or\r\n4-1/2-inch work, for small wells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Brick Steining.\r\n\r\nSectional Plans.\r\n\r\nFigs. 46-48.]\r\n\r\nFigs. 46 and 47 show the method of laying for 9-inch work, and Fig. 48\r\nfor 4-1/2 inches. The bricks are laid flat, breaking joint; and to keep\r\nout moderate land-springs clay, puddle, or concrete is often introduced\r\nat the back of the steining; for most purposes concrete is the best, as,\r\nin addition to its impervious character, it adds greatly to the strength\r\nof the steining. A ring or two of brickwork in cement is often\r\nintroduced at intervals, varying from 5 feet to 12 feet apart, to\r\nstrengthen the shaft, and facilitate the construction of the well.\r\n\r\nToo much care cannot be bestowed upon the steining; if properly executed\r\nit will effectually exclude all objectionable infiltration, but badly\r\nmade, it may prove a permanent source of trouble and annoyance. Half the\r\nwells condemned on account of sewage contamination really fail because\r\nof bad steining.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nWELL BORING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first method of well boring known in Europe is that called the\r\nChinese, in which a chisel suspended by a rope and surrounded by a tube\r\nof a few feet in length is worked up and down by means of a spring-pole\r\nor lever at the surface. The twisting and untwisting of the rope\r\nprevents the chisel from always striking in the same place; and by its\r\ncontinued blows the rock is pounded and broken. The chisel is withdrawn\r\noccasionally, and a bucket or shell-pump is lowered, having a hinged\r\nvalve at the bottom opening upwards, so that a quantity of the _débris_\r\nbecomes enclosed in the bucket, and is then drawn up by it to the\r\nsurface; the lowering of the bucket is repeated until the hole is\r\ncleared, and the chisel is then put to work again.\r\n\r\nFig. 49 is of an apparatus, on the Chinese system, which may be used\r\neither for hemp-rope or wire-rope, and which was originally made for\r\nhoop-iron. At A, Fig. 49, is represented a log of oak wood, which is set\r\nperpendicularly so deep in the ground as to penetrate the loose gravel\r\nand pass a little into the rock, and stand firm in its place; it is well\r\nrammed with gravel and the ground levelled, so that the butt of the log\r\nis flush with the surface of the ground, or a few feet below. Through\r\nthis log, which may be, according to the depth of loose ground, from 5\r\nfeet to 30 feet long, a vertical hole is bored by an auger of a diameter\r\nequal to that of the intended boring in the rock. On the top of the\r\nground, on one side of the hole, is a windlass whose drum is 5 feet in\r\ndiameter, and the cogwheel which drives it 6 feet; the pinion on the\r\ncrank axle is 6 inches. This windlass serves for hoisting the spindle or\r\ndrill, and is of a large diameter, in order to prevent short bends in\r\nthe iron, which would soon make it brittle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chinese System.\r\n\r\nFig. 49.]\r\n\r\nIn all cases where iron, either hoop-iron or wire-rope, is used, the\r\ndiameter of the drum of the windlass used must be sufficiently large to\r\nprevent a permanent bend in the iron. On the opposite side of the\r\nwindlass is a lever of unequal leverage, about one-third at the side of\r\nthe hole, and two-thirds at the opposite side, where it ends in a cross\r\nor broad end where men do the work. The workmen, with one foot on a\r\nbench or platform, rest their hands on a railing, and work with the\r\nother foot the long end of the lever. In this way the whole weight of\r\nthe men is made use of. The lift of the bore-bit is from 10 to 12\r\ninches, which causes the men to work the treadle from 20 to 24 inches\r\nhigh. Below the treadle, T, is a spring-pole, S, fastened under the\r\nplatform on which the men stand, the end of this spring-pole is\r\nconnected by a link to the working end of the lever, or to the rope\r\ndirectly, and pulls the treadle down. When the bore-spindle is raised by\r\nmeans of the treadle, the spring-pole imparts to it a sudden return, and\r\nincreases by these means the velocity of the bit, and consequently that\r\nof the stroke downwards.\r\n\r\nThis method has been generally disused, iron or wood rods substituted in\r\nthe place of the rope, and a variety of augers and chisels instead of\r\nthe simple chisel, with appliances for clearing the bore-hole of\r\n_débris_. Figs. 50 to 56 show examples of an ordinary set of well boring\r\ntools. Fig. 52 is a flat chisel; Fig. 53 a [V]-chisel; and Fig. 54 a\r\n[T]-chisel. These chisels are made from wrought-iron, and when small are\r\nusually 18 inches long, 2-1/2 inches extreme breadth, and weigh some\r\n4-1/2 lb.; the cutting edge being faced with the best steel. They are\r\nused for hard rocks, and whilst in operation need carefully watching\r\nthat they may be removed and fresh tools substituted when their sides\r\nare sufficiently worn to diminish their breadth. If this circumstance is\r\nnot attended to the size of the hole decreases, so that when a new\r\nchisel of the proper size is introduced it will not pass down to the\r\nbottom of the hole, and much unnecessary delay is occasioned in\r\nenlarging it. In working with the chisel, the borer keeps the tiller, or\r\nhandles, in both hands, one hand being placed upon each handle, and\r\nmoves slowly round the bore, in order to prevent the chisel from falling\r\ntwice, successively, in the same place, and thus preserve the bore\r\ncircular. Every time a fresh chisel is lowered to the bottom it should\r\nbe worked round in the hole, to test whether it is its proper size and\r\nshape; if this is not the case the chisel must be raised at once and\r\nworked gradually and carefully until the hole is as it should be. The\r\ndescription of strata being cut by the chisel can be ascertained with\r\nconsiderable accuracy by a skilful workman from the character of the\r\nshock transmitted to the rods.\r\n\r\nWhen working in sandstone there is no adherence of the rock to the\r\nchisel when drawn to the surface, but with clays the contrary is the\r\ncase. Should the stratum be very hard, the chisel may be worn and blunt\r\nbefore cutting three quarters of an inch, it must therefore be raised to\r\nthe surface and frequently examined; however, 7 or 8 inches may be bored\r\nwithout examination, should the nature of the stratum allow of such\r\nprogress being made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Well-boring Tools.\r\n\r\nFigs. 50-56.]\r\n\r\nGround augers, Figs. 50, 51, and 56, are similar in action to those used\r\nfor boring wood, but differ in shape and construction. The common earth\r\nauger, Fig. 50, is 3 feet in length, having the lower two-thirds\r\ncylindrical. The bottom is partially closed by the lips, and there is an\r\nopening a little up one side for the admission of soft or bruised\r\nmaterial. Augers are only used for penetrating soft rock, clay, and\r\nsand; and their shape is varied to suit the nature of the strata\r\ntraversed, being open and cylindrical for clays having a certain degree\r\nof cohesion, conical, and sometimes closed, in quicksands. Augers are\r\nsometimes made as long as 10 feet, and are then very effective if the\r\nstrata is soft enough to permit of their use. The shell is made from 3\r\nfeet to 3-1/2 feet in length, of nearly the same shape as the common\r\nauger, sometimes closed to the bottom, Fig. 56, or with an auger nose,\r\nFig. 51; in either case there is a clack or valve placed inside for the\r\npurpose of retaining borings of a soft nature or preventing them from\r\nbeing washed out in a wet hole. Fig. 59 shows a wad-hook for withdrawing\r\nstones, and Fig. 58 a worm-auger.\r\n\r\nThe Crow's Foot, Fig. 55, is used when the boring rods have broken in\r\nthe bore-hole, for the purpose of extracting that portion remaining in\r\nthe hole; it is the same length, and at the foot the same breadth as the\r\nchisels. When the rods have broken, the part above the fracture is drawn\r\nout of the bore-hole and the crow's foot screwed on in place of the\r\nbroken piece; when this is lowered down upon the broken rod, by careful\r\ntwisting the toe is caused to grip the broken piece with sufficient\r\nforce to allow the portion below the fracture to be drawn out of the\r\nbore-hole. A rough expedient is to fasten a metal ring to a rope and\r\nlower it over the broken rod, when the rod cants the ring, and thus\r\ngives it a considerable grip; this is often very successful. Fig. 57 is\r\na worm used for the same purpose. A bell-box, Fig. 60, is frequently\r\nemployed for drawing broken rods; it has two palls fixed at the top of\r\nthe box, which rise and permit the end of the rod to pass when the box\r\nis lowered, but upon raising it the palls fall and grip the rod firmly.\r\nA spiral angular worm, similar to Fig. 57, is also applied for\r\nwithdrawing tubes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Withdrawing Tools.\r\n\r\nFigs. 57-59.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bell-box.\r\n\r\nFig. 60.]\r\n\r\nOf these withdrawing tools the crow is the safest and best, as it may be\r\nused without that intelligent supervision and care absolutely necessary\r\nwith the worms and wad-hooks, or the bell-box.\r\n\r\nThe boring rods, Figs. 61, 62, are in 3, 6, 10, 15, or 20 feet lengths,\r\nof wrought-iron, preferably Swedish, and are made of different degrees\r\nof strength according to the depth of the hole for which they are\r\nrequired; they are generally 1 inch square in section: at one end is a\r\nmale and at the other end a female screw for the purpose of connecting\r\nthem together. The screw should not have fewer than six threads. One of\r\nthe sides of the female screw frequently splits and allows the male\r\nscrew to be drawn out, thus leaving the rods in the hole. By constant\r\nwear, also, the screw may have its thread so worn as to become liable to\r\nslip. Common rods being most liable to accident should be carefully\r\nexamined every time they are drawn out of the bore-hole, as an\r\nunobserved failure may occasion much inconvenience, and even the loss of\r\nthe bore-hole. In addition to the ordinary rods there are short pieces,\r\nvarying from 6 inches to 2 feet in length, which are fixed at the top,\r\nas required, for adjusting the rods at a convenient height.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Boring Rods.\r\n\r\nFig. 61, 62.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hand-dog.\r\n\r\nFig. 63.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lifting Dog.\r\n\r\nFig. 64, 65.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tillers.\r\n\r\nFig. 66.]\r\n\r\nFig. 63 is a hand-dog; Figs. 64 and 65, a lifting dog; Fig. 66, the\r\ntillers or handles by which the workmen impart a rotary motion to the\r\ntools. The tillers are clamped to the topmost boring rod at a convenient\r\nheight for working. Fig. 61, a top rod with shackle. Fig. 67, a\r\nspring-hook. When in use this should be frequently examined and kept in\r\nrepair.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Spring-hook.\r\n\r\nFig. 67.]\r\n\r\nLining tubes are employed to prevent the bore-hole falling in through\r\nthe lateral swelling of clay strata, or when passing through running\r\nsand. The tubes are usually of iron, of good quality, soft, easily bent,\r\nand capable of sustaining an indent without fracture. Inferior tubes\r\noccasion grave and costly accidents which are frequently irreparable, as\r\na single bad tube may endanger the success of an entire boring.\r\n\r\nWrought-iron tubes with screwed flush joints, Fig. 68, are to be\r\nrecommended, but they are supplied brazed, Fig. 69, or riveted, Fig. 70,\r\nand can be fitted with steel driving collars and shoes. Cast-iron tubes\r\nare constantly applied; they should have turned ends with wrought-iron\r\ncollars and countersunk screws.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tubes with Screwed Joints.\r\n\r\nFig. 68.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tubes with Brazed or Riveted Joints.\r\n\r\nFigs. 69, 70.]\r\n\r\nCold-drawn wrought-iron tubes have been used, and are very effective as\r\nwell as easily applied, but their relatively high cost occasions their\r\napplication to be limited.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Stud Block.\r\n\r\nFig. 71.]\r\n\r\nFig. 71 shows a stud-block, which is used for suspending tubing either\r\nfor putting it down or for drawing it up. It consists of a block made to\r\nfit inside the end of the tube, and attached to the rods in the usual\r\nway. In the side of the block is fixed an iron stud for slipping into a\r\nslot, similar to a bayonet-joint, cut in the end of the tube, so that it\r\nmay be thus suspended. Figs. 72 to 74 show various forms of\r\nspring-darts, and Fig. 75 a pipe-dog, for the same purpose. Sometimes a\r\nconical plug, with a screw cut around the outside for tightening itself\r\nin the upper end of the tube, is used for raising and lowering tubing.\r\nFigs. 76 and 77 are of tube clamps, and Fig. 78 tongs for screwing up\r\nthe tubes. Fig. 79 is of an ordinary form of sinker's bucket.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Spring-dart.\r\n\r\nFig. 72.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Spring-Dart.\r\n\r\nFig. 73.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Spring-dart.\r\n\r\nFig. 74.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pipe-dog.\r\n\r\nFig. 75.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tube Clamp.\r\n\r\nFig. 76.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tube Clamp.\r\n\r\nFig. 77.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tongs.\r\n\r\nFig. 78.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sinker's Bucket.\r\n\r\nFig. 79.]\r\n\r\nFig. 80 is a pipe-dolly, used for driving the lining tubes; the figure\r\nshows it in position ready for driving.\r\n\r\nWhen a projection in the bore-hole obstructs the downward course of the\r\nlining tubes, the hole can be enlarged below the pipes by means of a\r\nrimer, Fig. 81. It consists of an iron shank, to which is bolted two\r\nthin strips, bowed out in to the form of a drawing pen. The rimer is\r\nscrewed on to the boring rods, and forced down through the pipes; when\r\nbelow the last length of pipe the rimer expands, and can then be turned\r\nround, which has the effect of scraping the sides and enlarging that\r\nportion of the hole subject to its operation. Fig. 82 is of an improved\r\nform of rimer, termed a riming spring. It will be seen that this\r\ninstrument is much stronger than the ordinary rimer, in consequence of\r\nthe shank being extended through its entire length, thus rendering the\r\nscraping action of the bows very effective, whilst the slot at the foot\r\nof the bows permits of its introduction into, and withdrawal from, the\r\ntubing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pipe-dolly.\r\n\r\nFig. 80.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rimer.\r\n\r\nFig. 81.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Riming Spring.\r\n\r\nFig. 82.]\r\n\r\nIn England, for small works, the entire boring apparatus is frequently\r\narranged as in Fig. 83, the tool being fixed at the end of the\r\nwrought-iron rods instead of at the end of a rope, as in the Chinese\r\nmethod. Referring to Fig. 83, A is the boring tool; B the rod to which\r\nthe tool is attached; D D the levers by which the men E E give a\r\ncircular or rotating motion to the tool; F, chain for attaching the\r\nboring apparatus to the pole G, which is fixed at H, and by its means\r\nthe man at I transmits a vertical motion to the boring tool.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Boring Apparatus.\r\n\r\nEnglish, for Small Works.\r\n\r\nFig. 83.]\r\n\r\nThe sheer-legs, made of sound Norway spars not less than 8 inches\r\ndiameter at the bottom, are placed over the bore-hole for the purpose of\r\nsupporting the tackle K K for drawing the rods out of or lowering them\r\ninto the hole, when it is advisable to clean out the hole or renew the\r\nchisel. It is obvious that the more frequently it is necessary to break\r\nthe joints in drawing and lowering the rods, the more time will be\r\noccupied in changing the chisels, or in each cleaning of the hole, and\r\nas the depth of the hole increases the more tedious will the operation\r\nbe. It therefore becomes of much importance that the rods should be\r\ndrawn and lowered as quickly as possible, and to attain this end as long\r\nlengths as practicable should be drawn at each lift. The length of the\r\nlift or off-take, as it is termed, depending altogether upon the height\r\nof the lifting tackle above the top of the bore-hole, the length of the\r\nsheer-legs for a hole of any considerable depth should not be less than\r\n30 to 40 feet; and they usually stand over a small pit or surface-well,\r\nwhich may be sunk, where the clay or gravel is dry, to a depth of 20 or\r\n30 feet. From the bottom of this pit the bore-hole may be commenced, and\r\nhere will be stationed the man who has charge of the bore-hole while\r\nworking the rods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Boring Platform.\r\n\r\nFor Deep or Difficult Wells.\r\n\r\nFig. 84.]\r\n\r\nThe arrangement, Fig. 84, is intended for either deep or difficult\r\nboring. A regular scaffolding is erected upon which a platform is built.\r\nThe boring chisel A is, as in the last instance, coupled by means of\r\nscrew-couplings to the boring rods B. At each stroke two men stationed\r\nat E E turn the rod slightly by means of the tiller D D. A rope F, which\r\nis attached to the boring tool, is passed a few times round the drum of\r\na windlass G, the end of the rope being held by a man at I. When the\r\nhandles are turned by the men at L L the man at I pulls at the rope end,\r\nthe friction between the rope and the drum of the windlass is then\r\nsufficient to raise the rods and boring tool, but as soon as the tool\r\nhas been raised to its intended height the man at I slackens his hold\r\nupon the rope, and as there is insufficient friction on the drum to\r\nsustain the weight of the boring tools, they fall. By a repetition of\r\nthis operation the well is bored, and after it has been continued a\r\nsufficient length of time the tiller is unscrewed, and a lifting dog,\r\nattached to the rope from the windlass, is passed over the top of the\r\nrods, and then a short top rod with a shackle is screwed on. The two men\r\nat the windlass draw up the rods as far as the height of the\r\nscaffolding or sheer-legs will allow, when a man at E, Fig. 84, by\r\npassing a hand-dog or a key upon the top of the rod under the lowest\r\njoint drawn above the top of the hole, takes the weight of the rods at\r\nthis joint, the men at L having lowered the rods for this purpose; with\r\nanother key the rods are unscrewed at this joint, the rope is lowered\r\nagain, the lifting dog put over the rod, another top rod screwed on, the\r\nrods lifted, and the process continued until the chisel is drawn from\r\nthe hole and replaced by another, or, if necessary, replaced by some\r\nother tool.\r\n\r\nWhen a deep boring is undertaken, direct from the surface, the operation\r\nhad best be conducted with the aid of a boring sheer-frame such as is\r\nshown in the frontispiece. This consists of a framework of timber balks,\r\nupon which are erected four standards, 27 feet in height, and 9 inches ×\r\n1 foot thick, 3 feet 8 inches apart at bottom, and 1 foot 2 inches at\r\ntop, as seen in the front and rear elevations. The standards are tied by\r\nmeans of cross pieces, upon which shoulders are cut which fit into\r\nmortise holes, and are fastened by means of wooden keys, the standards\r\nbeing surmounted by two head pieces 5 feet long, mortised and fitted.\r\nUpon the head pieces two independent cast-iron guide pulleys are\r\narranged in bearings; over these pulleys are led the ends of two ropes\r\ncoiling in opposite directions upon the barrel of a windlass moved by\r\nspur gearing, and having a ratchet stop attached to a pair of diagonal\r\ntimbers, connected with the left-hand legs or standards of the sheers,\r\nnear the ground. These ropes are used for raising or lowering the\r\nlengths of the boring rod.\r\n\r\nEight feet below the bearings of the top pulleys, a pair of horizontal\r\ntraverses is fixed across the frame, supporting smaller pulleys mounted\r\non a cast-iron frame, which is capable of motion between horizontal\r\nwooden slides. Over these pulleys is led a rope from a plain windlass\r\nfixed to the right-hand legs of the frame, to be used for raising or\r\nlowering the shell to extract the _débris_ or rubbish from the hole.\r\n\r\nThe lever, 15 feet long, and 9 inches × 6 inches in section, is\r\nsupported by an independent timber frame. It has a cast-iron cap,\r\nfastened by means of two iron straps, cast with lugs through which bolts\r\nare passed, these being tightened with nuts in the ordinary manner. The\r\nbearing-pins at a are 1-1/2 inch in diameter, and also form part of the\r\nlower strap. Upon the cap is an iron hook, to this a chain is attached\r\ncarrying the spring-hook which bears the top shackle of the rods. The\r\ntop of the bore-hole is surrounded by a wooden tube 1 foot in diameter,\r\nand surrounded by a hinged valve, whose action is similar to that of a\r\nclack-valve; this has a hole in the centre for the rods to pass up and\r\ndown freely. The valve permits of the introduction and withdrawal of the\r\ntools, and at the same time prevents anything from above falling into\r\nthe bore-hole.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diminishing Tube Diameter Arrangement.\r\n\r\nFig. 85.]\r\n\r\nThe lever is applied by pressure upon its outer end, and as the relation\r\nof the long to the short arm is as 4 to 1, a depression of 2 feet in the\r\none case produces an elevation of 6 inches in the other, the minimum\r\nrange of action, the maximum being 26 inches.\r\n\r\nWith the sheer-frame the boring tools are worked in the same manner as\r\nin the preceding arrangements, Figs. 83, 84; but its portability,\r\ncompactness, and adaptation of means to the required end, render its use\r\ndesirable wherever it is possible to obtain it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Driving Ring for wrought-iron Tubes.\r\n\r\nFig. 86.]\r\n\r\nWhen in the progress of the work it is found that the auger does not go\r\ndown to the depth from which it was withdrawn, after trial, tubing will\r\ngenerally be necessary. The hole should be enlarged from the surface,\r\nor, if not very deep, commenced afresh from the surface with a larger\r\nauger, and run down to nearly the same depth; the first length of tube\r\nis then driven into the hole, and when this is effected another tube,\r\nhaving similar dimensions to the first, is screwed into its upper end,\r\nand the driving repeated, and so on until a sufficient number of pipes\r\nhave been used to reach to the bottom of the hole. If the ordinary auger\r\nis now introduced through these tubes it will have free access to the\r\nclay or sand, and after a few feet deeper have been bored another pipe\r\nmay be screwed on, and the whole driven farther down. In this way from\r\n10 to 20 feet of soft stratum may be bored through. If the thickness of\r\nthe surface clay or sand is considerable the method here mentioned will\r\nnot be effective, as the friction of the pipes caused by the pressure\r\nof the strata will be so great that perhaps not more than 80 or 100 feet\r\ncan be driven without the pipes being injured. It will then be necessary\r\nto put down the first part of the bore-hole with a large auger, and\r\ndrive in pipes of larger diameter; the hole is continued of smaller\r\ndiameter, and lined with smaller tubes projecting beyond the large\r\ntubes, as in Fig. 85, until the necessity for their use ceases. It will\r\nbe evident that to ensure success the tubing, whatever it is made of,\r\nshould be as truly cylindrical as possible, straight, and flush surface,\r\nboth outside and in. It will also be evident that in thus joining pieces\r\nof tubing together, the thickness ought to have a due proportion to the\r\nwork required, and the force likely to be used in screwing or driving\r\nthem down. Wrought-iron tubes, when driven, must be worked carefully, by\r\nmeans of a ring made of wrought-iron, from 1-1/2 to 2 inches in height\r\nand 3/4 inch thick, and of the form shown in Fig. 86; or driven with a\r\npipe-dolly such as that in Fig. 80. The ring, or the dolly, is screwed\r\ninto the lowermost boring rod and worked at the same rate and in a\r\nsimilar manner to the chisel, due regard being had to the depth at which\r\nthe driving is being done, as the weight of the boring rods will\r\nmaterially affect the strength of the blow delivered. Cast-iron tubing\r\nmay be driven hard with a monkey. To withdraw broken or defective\r\ntubing quickly, two hooks attached to ropes are lowered down from\r\nopposite sides of the bore-hole, caught on the rim of the lowermost\r\ntube, and power applied to haul the tubing up bodily.\r\n\r\nFigs. 87 to 91 show good methods of forming tube or pipe joints both in\r\ncast and wrought-iron, when not screwed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 87.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 88.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 89.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 90.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 91.]\r\n\r\nP. S. Reed, an English mining engineer, gives the following instance of\r\nreplacing defective tubing in a boring which had been pursued to the\r\ndepth of 582-1/2 feet, but which, owing to circumstances which were\r\ndifficult to determine, had become very expensive, and made slow\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nThe 582-1/2 feet had been bored entirely by manual labour; but Reid\r\nrecommended the erection of a horse-gin, in which the power was applied\r\nto a 40-inch drum placed upon a vertical axle, the arms of which\r\nadmitted of applying two horses, and men at pleasure, the power gained\r\nbeing in the proportion of one to ten at the starting-point for the\r\nhorses.\r\n\r\nUpon the upright drum a double-ended chain was attached, which worked\r\nover sheer-legs erected immediately over the hole, so as to attain an\r\noff-take for the rods of 60 feet, and so as that, in the act of raising\r\nor lowering, there might always be one end of the chain in the bottom,\r\nready to be attached, and expedite the work as much as possible.\r\n\r\nThese arrangements being made, it was soon found that there was a defect\r\nin the tubing which was inserted to the depth of 109 feet, and the\r\ndefect was so serious, in permitting the sand to descend and be again\r\nbrought up with the boring tools, as to render it very difficult to tell\r\nin what strata they really were; this increased to such a degree as to\r\ncause the silting up of the hole in a single night to the extent of 180\r\nfeet, and it occupied nearly a fortnight in clearing the hole out again.\r\n\r\nOn carefully examining into this defect, it appeared that the water rose\r\nin the hole to the depth of 74 feet from the surface; and that at this\r\npoint it was about level with the high-water mark on the Tees, about two\r\nmiles distant, with which it was no doubt connected by means of\r\npermeable beds, extending from the arenaceous strata at a depth of 100\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nOn commencing to bore, the motion of the rods in the hole caused the\r\nvibration of the water between a range of 40 feet at the bottom of the\r\ntubing, and so disturbed the quiescent sand as to cause it to run down\r\nthrough the faults in the lower end of the tubing.\r\n\r\nThis tubing was made of galvanized iron plates, riveted together and\r\nsoldered; at the top of the hole it was in three concentric circles,\r\nwhich had been screwed and forced down successively until an obstacle\r\nwas met with at three different places. So soon as the outer circle\r\nreached the first depth, all hope appears to have vanished, from those\r\nwho bored the earlier part of the work, of getting the tube farther; a\r\nsecond tube was, therefore, inserted, which seems to have advanced as\r\nfar as the second obstacle, where it, in its turn, was abandoned; and a\r\nthird one advanced until it rested in the strata at the lower part of\r\nthe lias freestone of a blue nature, as found on the rocks at Seaton\r\nCarew, and in the bed of the Leven, near Hutton Rudby. The diameter of\r\nthe first tubing was 3-7/8 inches external and 3-1/2 inches internal;\r\nthe second tube was 3-1/4 inches external, and 3 inches internal\r\ndiameter; and the third tube was 2-3/4 inches external and 2-1/2 inches\r\ninternal diameter.\r\n\r\nSuch being the account gathered from the workmen who superintended the\r\nearlier part of the boring, it became necessary to decide upon the best\r\ncause to remedy the evil. At first sight it would have appeared easy\r\nenough to have caught the lower end of the tubes by means of a fish-head\r\nproperly contrived, and thus to have lifted them out of the hole, and\r\nreplaced them with a perfect tube, such as a gas-tube, with faucet\r\nscrew-joints; but, on attempting this, it soon became evident that\r\nhowever good the tubing which might have been adopted, it would be a\r\nwork of the greatest difficulty to extract when once it was regularly\r\nfixed and jammed into its place by the tenacious clayey strata\r\nsurrounding it; and the difficulty of extracting it, in the present\r\ncase, was even enhanced by the inferior quality and make of the tubing;\r\nin short, that, unless by crumpling it up in such a manner as to destroy\r\nthe hole, it was impossible to extract this tubing by main force.\r\n\r\nThere was, therefore, no other choice left but to attempt cutting it\r\nout, inch by inch; though before doing so, force was applied to the\r\nbottom of the tubing, to the extent of upwards of 30 tons, the only\r\nresult being the loss of several pieces of steel down the hole, which\r\nhad to be brought up with a powerful magnet.\r\n\r\nAfter much mature consideration and contrivance, it was determined to\r\norder such tubing as would at the same time present as little obstacle\r\nas possible to the clay to be passed through on the outside, as well as\r\nsurround the largest of the three tubes then in the hole, and present no\r\nobstacle to their being withdrawn through its interior.\r\n\r\nThese tubes were made 12 feet in length, flush outside and in, the lower\r\nportion being steeled for 6 inches from the bottom end, so as to cut its\r\nway and follow down the space, and cover that exposed by the old tubes\r\nwhen cut and drawn, as shown in Fig. 92.\r\n\r\nIn order to commence operations, and avoid too much clay going down to\r\nthe bottom of the hole, a straw-plug was firmly fixed in the lias\r\nportion of the hole. The lower portion of the new tubes was then screwed\r\naround the old ones by means of powerful clamps, attached to the\r\nexterior in such a manner as to avoid injuring the surface; and when\r\nthey could be screwed no farther, the knife or cutter, Figs. 92 to 94,\r\nwas introduced inside the old tubing. Some force was needed to get this\r\nknife down into the tubing, but the spring a giving so as to\r\naccommodate itself to the hole, permitted its descent to the distance\r\nrequired; this being effected, it was turned round so that the steel\r\ncutter, shown at _b_, being forced against the sides of the tube, cut it\r\nthrough in the course of ten minutes or a quarter of an hour's turning.\r\nSee section at _b_, _c_, Fig. 93.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Action of the Knife or Spring-cutter.\r\n\r\nPrepared for Cutting.\r\n\r\nFig. 92.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Action of the Knife or Cutter.\r\n\r\nReady for Removal after Cutting.\r\n\r\nFig. 93.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Back View of Knife or Cutter.\r\n\r\nFig. 94.]\r\n\r\nThe old tubes being three-ply, three of these knives or cutters were\r\nrequired to cut out the three tubes, the inner one being detached first,\r\nand then the two exterior ones; and so soon as these latter were cut out\r\nas far as they had been forced into the clay, the work became simplified\r\ninto following down the interior tubing by the new tubes, as shown by\r\nthe dotted lines. From _d_ at the lower end, it was found that the old\r\ninner tube had been so damaged or torn, either by the putting in or\r\nhammering it down, as to leave a vent or fissure for the sand to\r\ndescend, and thus spoil the whole of the work for all future success in\r\nthe boring, to say nothing of the very great cost of lifting the sand\r\nout, and subsequent most arduous labour to put the hole right.\r\n\r\nBoring was recommenced after about a month's labour in taking out the\r\nold tubings, leaving the new ones firmly bedded into the lias\r\nformation, 112 feet from the surface, and the hole was subsequently\r\nbored to a depth of 710 feet in the new red sandstone formation,\r\nproceeding at the rate of about 3 feet in the twelve hours, and leaving\r\nthe hole so as, if requisite, it might be widened out to 4 inches\r\ndiameter. Fig. 92 shows the action of the knife and spring-cutter when\r\nforced down into the tubing, ready to commence cutting. It also shows\r\nthe lower end of the new tubing, enclosing the others at the\r\ncommencement of the work. The joints of the new tubes were made by means\r\nof a half-lap screw. Fig. 94 is a back view of the knife or cutter _b_.\r\nFig. 93 shows the action of the spring and cutter when the requisite\r\nlength is cut through and ready for lifting; the position of the tube\r\nbeing maintained perpendicular, or nearly so, by the ball or thickening\r\non the rods at K, and the lower end of the tube being supported by the\r\nprojecting steel cutter at _b_, the dotted lines from _d_ showing the\r\nposition of the new steel-ended tube when screwed down ready for another\r\noperation. In boring deeper after the tubes were removed, three wooden\r\nblocks were used round the rods in the new tube to keep them plumb.\r\n\r\nIn some cases it is necessary to widen out holes below the sharp edge of\r\ntubing, so as to permit its descent. This is effected with a rimer,\r\nFigs. 81 and 82, and is an operation requiring great care and attention.\r\n\r\nTo reduce the stoppages for the withdrawal of _débris_ the system of\r\nFauvelle was introduced, but it is now very little practised on the\r\nContinent, and not at all in Great Britain. The principles upon which it\r\nwas founded were: first, that the motion given to the tool in rotation\r\nwas simply derived from the resistance that a rope would oppose to an\r\neffort of torsion; and therefore that the limits of application of the\r\nsystem were only such as would provide that the tool should be safely\r\nacted upon; and, secondly, that the injection of a current of water,\r\ndescending through a central tube, should wash out the _débris_ created\r\nby the cutting tool at the bottom. The difficulties attending the\r\nremoval of the _débris_ were great; and though the system of Fauvelle\r\nanswered tolerably well when applied to shallow borings, it was found\r\nto be attended with such disadvantages when applied on a large scale,\r\nthat it has been generally abandoned. The quantity of water required to\r\nkeep the boring tool clear is a great objection to the introduction of\r\nthis system, especially as in the majority of cases Artesian wells are\r\nsunk in such places as are deprived of the advantage of a large supply.\r\n\r\nIn the ordinary system of well boring, innumerable breakages and delays\r\noccur when a boring is required to be carried to any depth exceeding 200\r\nor 300 feet, owing to the buckling of the rods, the crystallization of\r\nthe iron by the constant jarring at each blow, and particularly the\r\nincreased weight of the rods as the hole gets deeper. It follows from\r\nthis, that where the excavation is very deep, there is considerable\r\ndifficulty in transmitting the blow of the tool, in consequence of the\r\nvibration produced in the long rod, or in consequence of the torsion;\r\nand, for the same reason, there is a danger of the blows not being\r\nequally delivered at the bottom. It has been attempted to obviate this\r\ndifficulty, but without much success, by the use of hollow rods,\r\npresenting greater sectional area than was absolutely necessary for the\r\nparticular case, in order to increase their lateral resistance to the\r\nblows tending to produce vibration.\r\n\r\nBoring is usually executed by contract. The approximate average cost in\r\nEngland may be taken at 1_s._ 3_d._ a foot for the first 30 feet; 2_s._\r\n6_d._ a foot for the second 30 feet; and continue in arithmetical\r\nprogression, advancing 1_s._ 3_d._ a foot for every additional 30 feet\r\nin depth. This does not include the cost of tubing, conveyance of plant\r\nand tools, professional superintendence, or working in rock of unusual\r\nhardness, such as hard limestone and whinstone. A clause is usually\r\ninserted in the contract, to the effect that, if any unforeseen\r\ndifficulty is met with in the course of the work, it is then paid for by\r\nthe day, at a rate previously determined upon, until the difficulty has\r\nbeen overcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nAMERICAN TUBE WELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis well consists of a hollow wrought-iron tube about 1-3/4 inch\r\ndiameter, composed of any number of lengths from 3 to 11 feet, according\r\nto the depth required. The water is admitted into the tube through a\r\nseries of holes, which extend up the lowest length to a height of 2-1/2\r\nfeet from the bottom.\r\n\r\nThe position for a well having been selected, a vertical hole is made in\r\nthe ground with a crowbar to a convenient depth; the well tube _a_,\r\nhaving the clamp _d_, monkey _c_, and pulleys _b_, Fig. 95, previously\r\nfixed on it, is inserted into this hole.\r\n\r\nThe clamp is then screwed firmly on to the tube from 18 inches to 2 feet\r\nfrom the ground, as the soil is either difficult or easy; each bolt\r\nbeing tightened equally, so as not to indent the tube.\r\n\r\nThe pulleys are next clamped on to the tube at a height of about 6 or 7\r\nfeet from the ground, the ropes from the monkey having been previously\r\nrove through them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tube Well Assembly.\r\n\r\nFig. 95.]\r\n\r\nThe monkey is raised by two men pulling the ropes at the same angle.\r\nThey should stand exactly opposite each other, and work together\r\nsteadily, so as to keep the tube perfectly vertical, and prevent it from\r\nswaying about while being driven. If the tube shows an inclination to\r\nslope towards one side, a rope should be fastened to its top and kept\r\ntaut on the opposite side, so as gradually to bring the tube back to the\r\nvertical. When the men have raised the monkey to within a few inches of\r\nthe pulleys, they lift their hands suddenly, thus slackening the ropes\r\nand allowing the monkey to descend with its full weight on to the clamp.\r\nThe monkey is steadied by a third man, who also assists to force it down\r\nat each descent. This man, likewise, from time to time, with a pair of\r\ngas-tongs, turns the tube round in the ground, which assists the process\r\nof driving, particularly when the point comes in contact with stones.\r\n\r\nParticular attention must be paid to the clamp, to see that it does not\r\nmove on the tube; the bolts must be tightened up at the first appearance\r\nof any slipping.\r\n\r\nWhen the clamp has been driven down to the ground, the monkey is raised\r\noff it, the screws of the clamp are slackened, and the clamp is again\r\nscrewed to the tube, about 18 inches or 2 feet from the ground. After\r\nthis, the monkey is lowered on to it, and the pulleys are then raised\r\nuntil they are again 6 or 7 feet from the ground.\r\n\r\nThe driving is continued until but 5 or 6 inches of the well tube remain\r\nabove the ground, when the clamp, monkey, and pulleys are removed, and\r\nan additional length of tube screwed on to that in the ground. This is\r\ndone by first screwing a collar on to the tube in the ground, and then\r\nscrewing the next length of tube into the collar, till it buts against\r\nthe lower tube; a little white-lead must be placed on the threads of the\r\ncollar before the ends of the tubes are screwed into it.\r\n\r\nThe driving can thus be continued until the well has obtained the\r\ndesired depth. Soon after another length has been added, the upper\r\nlength should be turned round a little with the gas-tongs, to tighten\r\nthe joints, which have a tendency to become loose from the jarring of\r\nthe monkey. Care must be taken, after getting into a water-bearing\r\nstratum, not to drive through it, owing to anxiety to get a large\r\nsupply. From time to time, and always before screwing on an additional\r\nlength of tube, the well should be sounded, by means of a small lead\r\nattached to a line, to ascertain the depth of water, if any, and\r\ncharacter of the earth which has penetrated through the holes perforated\r\nin the lower part of the well tube. As soon as it appears that the well\r\nhas been driven deep enough, the pump is screwed on to the top and the\r\nwater drawn up. It usually happens that the water is at first thick, and\r\ncomes in but small quantities; but after pumping for some little time,\r\nas the chamber round the bottom of the well becomes enlarged, the\r\nquantity increases and the water becomes clearer.\r\n\r\nWhen sinking in gravel or clay, the bottom of the well tube is liable to\r\nbecome filled up by the material penetrating through the holes; and\r\nbefore a supply of water can be obtained, this accumulation must be\r\nremoved by means of the cleaning pipes.\r\n\r\nThe cleaning pipes are of small diameter, 1/2-inch externally, and the\r\nseveral lengths are connected together in the same way as the well\r\ntubes, by collars screwing on over the adjoining end of two pipes.\r\n\r\nTo clear the well, one cleaning pipe after another is lowered into the\r\nwell, until the lower end touches the accumulation; the pipes must be\r\nheld carefully, for if one were to drop into the well it would be\r\nimpossible to get it out without drawing the well. A pump is then\r\nattached to the upper cleaning pipe by means of a reducing socket; the\r\nlower end of the cleaning pipe is then raised and held about an inch\r\nabove the accumulation by means of the gas-tongs: water is next poured\r\ndown the well outside the cleaning pipe, and, being pumped up through\r\nthe cleaning pipe, brings up with it the upper portion of the\r\naccumulation; the cleaning pipe is gradually lowered, and the pumping\r\ncontinued until the whole of the stuff inside the well tube is removed.\r\nThe pump is then removed from the cleaning pipe, and the cleaning pipes\r\nare withdrawn piece by piece; and finally the pump is screwed on to the\r\nupper end of the tube well, Fig. 96, which is then in working order.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tube Well in Working Order.\r\n\r\nFig. 96.]\r\n\r\nThe tube being very small, is in itself capable of containing only a\r\nlimited supply of water, which would be exhausted by a few strokes of\r\nthe pump; the condition, therefore, upon which alone these tube wells\r\ncan be effective, is that there shall be a free flow of water from the\r\noutside through the apertures into the lower end of the tube. When the\r\nstratum in which the water is found is very porous, as in the case of\r\ngravel and some sorts of chalk, the water flows freely; and a yield has\r\nbeen obtained in such situations as great and rapid as the pump has been\r\nable to lift, that is 600 gallons an hour. In some other soils, such as\r\nsandy loam, the yield in itself may not be sufficiently rapid to supply\r\nthe pump; in such cases, the effect of constant pumping is to draw up\r\nwith the water from the bottom a good deal of clay and sand, and so\r\ngradually to form a reservoir, as it were, around the foot of the tube,\r\nin which water accumulates when the pump is not in action, as is the\r\ncase in a common well. In dense clays, however, of a close and very\r\ntenacious character, the American tube well is not applicable, as the\r\nsmall perforations become sealed, and water will not enter the tube.\r\nWhen the stratum reached by driving is a quicksand, the quantity of sand\r\ndrawn up from the water will be so great, that a considerable amount\r\nwill have to be pumped before the water will come up clear; and even in\r\nsome positions, when the quicksand is of great extent, the effect of the\r\npumping may be to injure the foundations of adjoining buildings on the\r\nsurface of the ground.\r\n\r\nThe tube well cannot itself be driven through rock, although it might be\r\nused for drawing water from a subjacent stratum through a hole bored in\r\nthe rock to receive it.\r\n\r\nSubject to these conditions, these tube wells afford a ready and\r\neconomical means for drawing water to the surface from a depth not\r\nexceeding 27 or 28 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nWELL BORING AT GREAT DEPTHS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first well that was executed of great depth, and which gave rise to\r\nthe adoption of tools which directed public attention to the art of well\r\nboring, was that for the city of Paris by Mulot, at the Abattoir of\r\nGrenelle. This was commenced in the year 1832; and after more than eight\r\nyears' incessant labour, water rose, on the 26th of February, 1842, from\r\nthe total depth of 1798 feet. Subsequent to this, many wells have been\r\nsunk on the Continent, with the hope of attaining the brine springs so\r\noften met with in the Rhine provinces, or the springs destined for the\r\nsupply of towns, and which are even deeper than the well of Grenelle,\r\nreaching in some cases to the extraordinary depth of 2800 feet; but all\r\nof them, like the Grenelle well, of small diameter. In their\r\nconstruction, however, the German engineers introduced some important\r\nmodifications of the tools employed; and, amongst other inventions,\r\nEuyenhausen imparted a sliding movement to the striking part of the tool\r\nused for comminuting the rock, so as to fall always through a certain\r\ndistance; and thus, while he produced a uniform action upon the rock at\r\nthe bottom, he avoided the jar of the tools. Kind also began to apply\r\nhis system to the working of the large excavations for the purpose of\r\nwinning coal. Whilst the art was in this state, and when he had already\r\nexecuted some very important works in Germany, Belgium, the North of\r\nFrance, Creuzot, and Seraing, the Municipal Council of Paris determined\r\nto entrust him with the execution of a new well they were about to sink\r\nat Passy.\r\n\r\nIn sinking the well of Passy, the weight of the trepan for comminuting\r\nthe rock was about 1 ton 16 cwt., 1800 kilog.: the height through which\r\nit fell was about 60 centimètres; and its diameter was 3 feet 3-7/16\r\ninches, 1 mètre. The rods were of oak, about 8 inches on the side, and\r\nthe dimensions of the cutting tool were limited to 3 feet 3-7/16 inches\r\nbecause it worked the whole time in water; but generally the class of\r\nborings Kind undertook were of such a description as justified resorting\r\nto tools of great dimensions. When sinking the shafts for winning coal,\r\nhis operations required to be carried on with the full diameters of 10\r\nfeet or 14 feet; and he then drove a boring of 3 feet 4 inches diameter\r\nin the first instance, and subsequently enlarged this excavation. There\r\ncan be no objection to executing Artesian borings of this diameter,\r\nother than the probable exhaustion of the supply; particularly as it is\r\nnow known that the yield of water by these methods is proportionate to\r\nthe diameter of the column; though, strange as it may appear, the first\r\nopposition to Kind's plan of sinking the well of Passy was founded upon\r\nthe assumption that he would not meet with a larger supply of water from\r\nthe subcretaceous formations than had been met with at Grenelle, where\r\nthe diameter of the boring was at the bottom not more than 8 inches. It\r\nis now, however, proved that there is a direct gain in adopting the\r\nlarger borings, not only as regards the quantity of water to be derived\r\nfrom them, but also in their execution, arising from the fact that the\r\ntools can be made more secure against the effects of torsion or of\r\nconcussion against the sides of the excavation, which is the cause of\r\nthe most serious accidents met with in well sinking.\r\n\r\nThe trepan of M. Kind contains some peculiar details, which are shown in\r\nFigs. 97, 98. The trepan is composed of two principal pieces, the frame\r\nand the arms, both of wrought-iron, with the exception of the teeth of\r\nthe cutting part, which are of cast steel. The frame has at the bottom a\r\nseries of holes, slightly conical, into which the teeth are inserted,\r\nand tightly wedged up, Fig. 99. These teeth are placed with their\r\ncutting edges on the longitudinal axis of the frame that receives them;\r\nand at the extremity of the frame there are formed two heads, forged out\r\nof the same piece with the body of the tool, which also carries two\r\nteeth, placed in the same direction as the others, but double their\r\nwidth, in order to render this part of the tool more powerful. By\r\nincreasing the dimensions of these end teeth, the diameter of the boring\r\ncan be augmented, so as to compensate for the diminution of the clear\r\nspace caused by the tubing, necessarily introduced for security in\r\ntraversing strata disposed to fall in, or for the purpose of allowing\r\nthe water from below to escape at an intermediate level.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Trepan of M. Kind.\r\n\r\nFigs. 97-99.]\r\n\r\nAbove the lower part of the frame of the trepan is a second piece\r\ncomposed of two parts bolted together, and made to support the lower\r\nportion of the frame. This part of the machinery also carries two teeth\r\nat its extremities, which serve to guide the tool in its descent, and to\r\nwork off the asperities left by the lower portion of the trepan. Above\r\nthis, again, are the guides of the machinery, properly speaking,\r\nconsisting of two pieces of wrought-iron, arranged in the form of a\r\ncross, with the ends turned up, so as to preserve the machinery\r\nperfectly vertical in its movements, by pressing against the sides of\r\nthe boring already executed. These pieces are independent of the blades\r\nof the trepan, and may be moved closer to it or farther away from it, as\r\nmay be desired. The stem and the arms are terminated by a single piece\r\nof wrought-iron, which is joined to the frame with a kind of\r\nsaddle-joint, and is kept in its place by means of keys and wedges. The\r\nwhole of the trepan is finally jointed to the great rods that\r\ncommunicate the motion from the surface, by means of a screw-coupling,\r\nformed below the part of the tool which bears the joint; this\r\narrangement permits the free fall of the cutting part, and unites the\r\ntop of the arms and frame, and the rod, Fig. 100. It has been proposed\r\nto substitute for this screw-coupling a keyed joint, in order to avoid\r\nthe inconvenience frequently found to attend the rusting of the screw,\r\nwhich often interposes great difficulties in cases where it becomes\r\nnecessary to withdraw the trepan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Rod.\r\n\r\nFig. 100.]\r\n\r\nThe sliding joint is the part of Euyenhausen's invention most\r\nunhesitatingly adopted by Kind, and it is one of the peculiarities of\r\nhis system as contrasted with the processes formerly in use. So long as\r\nhis operations were confined to the small dimensions usually adopted for\r\nArtesian borings, he contented himself with making a description of\r\njoint with a free fall; a simple movement of disengagement regulating\r\nthe height fixed by the machinery itself, like the fall of the monkey in\r\na pile-driving machine; but it was found that this system did not answer\r\nwhen applied to large borings, and it also presented certain dangers.\r\nKind then, for the larger class of borings, availed himself of sliding\r\nguides, so contrived as to be equally thrown out of gear when the\r\nmachinery had come to the end of the stroke, and maintained in their\r\nrespective positions by being made in two pieces, of which the inner one\r\nworked upon slides, moving freely in the piece that communicated the\r\nmotion to the striking part of the machinery. The two parts of the tool\r\nwere connected with pins, and with a sliding joint, which, in the Passy\r\nwell, was thrown out of gear by the reaction of the column of water\r\nabove the tool unloosing the click that upheld the lower part of the\r\ntrepan, Figs. 101 to 103. The changes thus made in the usual way of\r\nreleasing the tool, and in guiding it in its fall were, however, matters\r\nof detail; they involved no new principle in the manner of well boring:\r\nand the modern authorities upon the subject consider that there was\r\nsomething deficient in Kind's system of making the column of water act\r\nupon a disc by which the click was set in motion. This system, in fact,\r\nrequired the presence of a column of water not always to be commanded,\r\nespecially when the borings had to be executed in the carboniferous\r\nstrata.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sliding Joints.\r\n\r\nFigs. 101-103.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: wrought-iron Joints.\r\n\r\nFig. 104.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Shell Elevation.]\r\n\r\nThe rods used for the suspension of the trepan, and for the transmission\r\nof the blows to it, were of oak; and this alone would constitute one of\r\nthe most characteristic differences between the system of tools\r\nintroduced by Kind and those made by the majority of well-borers, but\r\nwhich, like the disengagement of the tool intended to comminute the\r\nrock, depended for its success upon the boring being filled with water.\r\nThe resistance that the wood offers, by its elasticity, to the effects\r\nof any sudden jar, is also to be taken into account in the comparison of\r\nthe latter with iron, for the iron is liable to change its form under\r\nthe influence of this cause. The resistance to an effort of torsion need\r\nnot, however, be much dwelt on, for the turn given to the trepan is\r\nalways made when the tool is lifted up from its bed. For the purpose of\r\nmaking the rods, Kind recommended that straight-grown trees, of the\r\nrequisite diameter, should be selected, rather than they should be made\r\nof cut-timber, as there is less danger of the wood warping, and the\r\ncharacter of the wood is more homogeneous. He generally used these trees\r\nin lengths of about 50 feet, and he connected them at the ends with\r\nwrought-iron joints, fitting one into the other, Fig. 104. The ironwork\r\nof the joints is made with a shoulder underneath the screw-coupling, to\r\nallow the rods to be suspended by the ordinary crow's foot during the\r\noperation of raising or lowering them. In the works executed at Passy\r\nthere was a kind of frame erected over the centre of the boring, of\r\nsufficient height to allow of the rods being withdrawn in two lengths at\r\na time, thus producing a considerable economy of time and labour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Shell Plan.\r\n\r\nFigs. 105, 106.]\r\n\r\nNearly all the processes yet introduced for removing the products of the\r\nexcavation must be considered to be, more or less, defective, because\r\nall are established on the supposition that the comminuting tool must be\r\nwithdrawn, in order that the shell, or other tool intended to remove the\r\nproducts of the working of the comminutor, may be inserted. This remark\r\napplies to Kind's operations at Passy and elsewhere, as he removed the\r\nrock detached from the bottom of the excavation by a shell, Figs. 105,\r\n106, which was a modification of the tool he invariably employs for this\r\npurpose. It consisted of a cylinder of wrought-iron, suspended from the\r\nrods by a frame, and fastened to it, a little below the centre of\r\ngravity, so that the operation of upsetting it, when loaded, could be\r\neasily performed. This cylinder was lowered to the level of the last\r\nworkings of the trepan, and the materials already detached by that\r\ninstrument were forced into the tool, by the gradual movement of the\r\nlatter in a vertical direction. Some other implements, employed by Kind\r\nfor the purpose of removing the products of the excavation in the shafts\r\nfor the coal-mines of the North of France, were ingenious, and well\r\nadapted to the large dimensions of the shafts; but they were all, in\r\nsome degree, exposed to the danger of becoming fixed, if used in the\r\nsmall borings of Artesian wells, by the minute particles of rocks\r\nfalling down between their sides and the excavation from above. Their\r\nuse was therefore abandoned, and the well of Passy was cleared out with\r\nthe shell, the bottom of which was made to open upwards, with a hinged\r\nflap, which admitted the finer materials detached by the trepan. There\r\nwere also several tools for the purpose of withdrawing the broken parts\r\nof the machinery from the excavation, or whatever substances might fall\r\nin from above; and all were marked by a great degree of simplicity, but\r\nthey did not differ enough from those generally used for the same\r\npurpose to merit further remarks. In fact, the accidents intended to be\r\nguarded against or remedied are so precisely alike in all cases, that\r\nthere can be little variety in the manufacture of these instruments. But\r\nthere is no doubt that Kind deprived himself of a valuable appliance in\r\nnot using the ball-clack, _la soupape à boulet_, that other well-borers\r\nemploy, Fig. 107.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ball-clack.\r\n\r\nFig. 107.]\r\n\r\nAt Passy great strength was given to the head of the striking tool, and\r\nto the part of the machinery applied to turn the trepan, because the\r\ngreat weight of the latter superinduced the danger of its breaking off\r\nunder the influence of the shock, and because the solidity of this part\r\nof the machinery necessarily regulated the whole working of the tool.\r\nThe head of the boring arrangement was connected with the balance-beam\r\nof the steam-engine by a straight link-chain, with a screw-coupling,\r\nadmitting of being lengthened as the trepan descended, Figs. 108, 109.\r\nThe balance-beam, in order to increase its elastic force in the upward\r\nstroke, is in Kind's works made of wood, in two pieces; the upper one\r\nbeing of fir and the lower one of beech. The whole of the machinery is\r\nput in motion by steam, which is admitted to the upper part of the\r\ncylinder, and presses it down, and thus raises the tool at the other end\r\nof the beam to that part in connection with the cylinder. The\r\ncounterpoise to the weight of the tools is also placed upon the\r\ncylinder-end of the beam. The cylinder receives the steam through ports\r\nthat are opened and closed by hand, like those of a steam-hammer; so\r\nthat the number of the strokes of the piston may be increased or\r\ndiminished, and the length of the strokes may be increased, as occasion\r\nmay require.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Side Elevations on Balance-beam Connection.\r\n\r\nFigs. 108, 109.]\r\n\r\nThe balance-beam is continued beyond the point where the piston is\r\nconnected with it, and it goes to meet the blocks placed to check the\r\nforce of the blow given by the descent of the tool. The guides of the\r\npiston-head are attached to the part of the machinery that acts in this\r\nmanner; but at Passy, Kind made the balance-beam work upon two free\r\nplummer-blocks, or blocks having no permanent cover, that they might be\r\nmore easily moved whenever it was necessary to displace the beam, for\r\nthe purpose of taking up or letting down the rods, or for changing the\r\ntools; for the balance-beam was always immediately over the centre of\r\nthe tools, and it therefore had to be displaced every time that the\r\nlatter were required to be changed. This was effected by allowing the\r\nbeam to slide horizontally, so as to leave the mouth of the pit open.\r\nThe counter-check, above mentioned, likewise prevented the piston from\r\nstriking the cylinder cover with too great a force, when it was brought\r\nback by the weight of the tools to its original position. The operation\r\nof raising and lowering the rods, or of changing the tools, was\r\nperformed at Passy by a separate steam-engine, and the shell was\r\ndischarged into a special truck, moving upon a railway expressly laid\r\nfor this purpose in the great tower erected over the excavation. All\r\nthese arrangements were in fact made with the extreme attention to the\r\ndetails of the various parts of the work which characterizes the\r\nproceedings of foreign engineers, and conduces so much to their success.\r\n\r\nThe beating, or comminution of the rock, was usually effected at Passy\r\nat the rate of from fifteen strokes to twenty strokes a minute. The rate\r\nof descent, of course, differed in a marked manner, according to the\r\nnature of the rock operated upon; but, generally speaking, the trepan\r\nwas worked for the space of about eight hours at a time, after which it\r\nwas withdrawn, and the shell let down in order to remove the _débris_.\r\nThe average number of men employed in the gang, besides the foreman, or\r\nthe superintendent of the well, was about fourteen: they consisted of a\r\nsmith and hammerman, whose duty it was to keep the tools in order; and\r\ntwo shifts of men entrusted with the excavation, namely, an\r\nengine-driver and stoker, a chief workman, or sub-foreman, and three\r\nassistants. The total time employed in sinking the shafts executed upon\r\nthis system in the North of France, where it has been applied without\r\nmeeting with the accidents encountered in the Passy well, was found to\r\nbe susceptible of being divided in the following manner: from 25 per\r\ncent. to 56 per cent. was employed in manoeuvring the trepan; from 11\r\nper cent. to 14-1/2 per cent. in raising and lowering the tools; from 19\r\nper cent. to 21 per cent. in removing the materials detached from the\r\nrocks, and cleaning out the bottom of the excavation; and from 8 per\r\ncent. to 10-1/2 per cent. was lost, owing to the stoppage of the\r\nengines, or to the accidents from broken tools, or to other causes\r\nalways attending these operations. In the well of Passy there was, of\r\ncourse, a considerable difference in the proportions of the time\r\nemployed in the various details of the work; and the long period\r\noccupied in obviating the effects of the slips which took place in the\r\nclays, both in the basement beds of the Paris basin and in the\r\nsubcretaceous strata, would render any comparison derived from that well\r\nof little value; but it would appear that, until the great accident\r\noccurred, the various operations went on precisely as Kind had\r\ncalculated upon.\r\n\r\n\r\nKIND-CHAUDRON SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Section through Kind-Chaudron Well at Durham.\r\n\r\nFig. 110.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1872 Emerson Bainbridge, C.E., drew attention to the\r\nKind-Chaudron system of sinking mine shafts through water-bearing\r\nstrata, without the use of pumping machinery, in a paper read before the\r\nInstitute of Civil Engineers. As the operation is almost identical with\r\nthat which would have to be carried through in the case of a well sunk\r\nthrough an upper series of water-bearing strata, of minor importance or\r\nof impure quality, past rock and into the lower water strata, as for\r\ninstance through tertiaries and chalk into the lower greensand, the\r\nfollowing extract from Bainbridge's paper may be read with interest.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it may be desirable to describe briefly the system\r\nof sinking hitherto pursued in passing through strata yielding large\r\nquantities of water. The most important sinkings of this character have\r\nbeen carried out in the county of Durham, to the east of the point at\r\nwhich the Permian overlie the carboniferous rocks. In this district\r\nthere is a thin bed of sand between the Permian rock and the coal\r\nmeasures. Towards this bed the feeders of water are generally found to\r\nincrease, and in the sand there is usually a large reservoir of water.\r\nThe mode of sinking will be understood by reference to Fig. 110. Whilst\r\nsinking in hard rock, it has ordinarily been the custom to place iron\r\ncurbs, or cribs, wherever a bed of stone appeared to form a natural\r\nbarrier between two distinct feeders of water. Thus it has frequently\r\nhappened that important feeders have been tubbed back, rendering much\r\nless pumping power necessary than would have been required had all the\r\nfeeders been allowed to accumulate in the shaft. As will be seen by Fig.\r\n110, the number of wedging cribs employed is no less than thirteen in\r\n250 feet. The cribs forming the foundation of each set of tubbing are\r\ngenerally much more massive and costly than the segments of tubbing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cast-iron Tubbing.\r\n\r\nFig. 111.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wooden Tubbing.\r\n\r\nFig. 112.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: End Elevation showing Arrangement at Extensive Sinking.\r\n\r\nFig. 113.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Side Elevation showing Arrangement at Extensive Sinking.\r\n\r\nFig. 114.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pass Pipe.\r\n\r\nFig. 115.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pass Pipe.\r\n\r\nFig. 116.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ball Type of Pressure Equalizer.\r\n\r\nFig. 118.]\r\n\r\nThe process of fixing the crib is as follows;--The diameter of the shaft\r\nis made about 30 inches larger than that of the inside of the tubbing.\r\nWhen a bed of rock, which may be considered sufficiently hard and close\r\nto separate the feeders above and below it, is reached, the shaft is\r\ncontracted to the diameter of the tubbing, and a smooth horizontal face\r\nis made on which to place the wedging crib. The wedging crib, which\r\nusually consists of segments about 4 feet long by 6 inches high by 14\r\ninches wide, is then placed on the bed. To give the crib a firm and\r\nsecure position, it is tightly wedged with wood, both behind and between\r\nthe joints; the tubbing is then built upon it to the next wedging crib,\r\nwhich rests upon a bell-shaped section of rock. When the tubbing nearly\r\nreaches this crib, the rock is removed piece by piece, and the top ring\r\nof tubbing is placed close up against the crib. It will thus be seen\r\nthat the fixing of each crib is a costly process, often causing\r\nconsiderable delay.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, where it has been difficult to find suitable foundations\r\nfor intermediate wedging cribs, the whole of the water-bearing rocks\r\nhave been sunk through without attempting to stop the feeders\r\nseparately, and no tubbing has been placed in the shaft till the wedging\r\ncrib could be fixed below the lowest feeder. This process is more\r\nexpeditious where there are small quantities of water; but where the\r\nwater is excessive greater delay is caused by contending with it than\r\nfrom putting in numerous sets of tubbing to stop the feeders separately.\r\nThe tubbing used in England has almost invariably been of cast-iron; on\r\nthe Continent, till recently, tubbing of wood has chiefly been used.\r\nIllustrations of both descriptions are shown by Figs. 111 and 112.\r\n\r\nFigs. 113, 114, show, in elevation, the plant and the arrangements\r\ngenerally in use at extensive sinkings. Where the water is in large\r\nquantities it is usually pumped by an engine erected for the purpose,\r\nassisted by the engine or engines intended to be employed to raise the\r\ncoal. A small capstan engine is used for passing the men and material up\r\nand down the pit during the sinking, such engine being provided also\r\nwith a drum on slow motion, which is used for heavy weights. The\r\ncontinual pumping, the placing of cribs, and the fixing of the tubbing\r\nare proceeded with till the lowest feeder is reached, when a hard bed is\r\nsought for on which to fix the lowest wedging crib. In all cases the\r\nwater has to be pumped out before the wedging crib, which forms the\r\nfoundation of each set of tubbing, can be placed.\r\n\r\nFrom this description it will be understood that the sinkers, who number\r\nfrom ten to twelve at one time, working four hours at a shift in a pit,\r\nsay, 14 feet in diameter, are compelled to work in water until all the\r\ntubbing is fixed. This causes a serious obstacle to blasting, and in\r\nother ways delays the progress of the work.\r\n\r\nThe tubbing used for damming back the water is generally in segments\r\nfrom 1 foot to 3 feet high, and about 4 feet in length, the thickness\r\nvarying from half an inch to 3-3/4 inches. It is kept in position by\r\npacking with wood behind the joints; and is made water-tight by placing\r\nbetween the segments pieces of wood sheeting about half an inch thick,\r\nwhich are wedged when all the tubbing is fixed, usually twice with wood,\r\nand sometimes once with iron wedges.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pressure Equalizing Valve in the Wedging Crib.\r\n\r\nFig. 117.]\r\n\r\nTo equalize the pressure of water and gas behind the different sets of\r\ntubbing, pass pipes, Figs. 115 and 116, are sometimes used. Another\r\nexpedient to effect this is to have a valve, working upwards, placed in\r\nthe wedging crib, Fig. 117. A ball is also sometimes used, Fig. 118.\r\n\r\nThe various modes of piercing beds of quicksand are;--By hanging tubbing\r\nto that already fixed, and adding fresh rings as the sand is removed.\r\nThis is only practicable when the quantity of sand is inconsiderable. By\r\nheavily weighting a cylinder of iron of the same size as the shaft, and\r\nthus forcing it down through the sand. By keeping back the sand by the\r\nuse of piles--a resource that can only be recommended when the bed of\r\nsand is not of great thickness. When the water is excessive, by using\r\npneumatic agency. As these operations are apart from our immediate\r\nsubject we need not further discuss them.\r\n\r\nM. Chaudron's system, which is a modification of Kind's, is divisible\r\ninto the following distinct processes, which consist of;--\r\n\r\nThe erection of the necessary machinery on the surface, and the opening\r\nof the mine.\r\n\r\nThe boring of the pits to the lowest part of the water-bearing strata.\r\n\r\nThe placing of the tubbing.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of cement behind the tubbing to complete its solidity.\r\n\r\nThe extraction of the water from the pits, and the placing of the\r\nwedging cribs, or \"faux cuvelage,\" below the moss box.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Surface Plant Elevation.\r\n\r\nFig. 119.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Surface Plant Elevation.\r\n\r\nFig. 120.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Surface Plant Plan.\r\n\r\nFig. 121.]\r\n\r\nFigs. 119 to 121 show in elevations and in plan the plant usually\r\nemployed on the surface. O is a small capstan engine, having a cylinder\r\n20 inches in diameter and a stroke of 32 inches, working on the third\r\nmotion. Attached to this engine, and working in the small pit C, is a\r\ncounterbalance weight. This engine is used for raising and lowering\r\nboring tools, and for lifting the _débris_ resulting from the boring. As\r\nfar as the platform, which is about 10 feet from the surface, the pit\r\nhas a diameter of 19 feet, or 4 feet more than the diameter of the pit\r\nbelow. A at level of about 38 feet above this platform there is a\r\ntramway on which small trucks run, carrying the _débris_ cylinder on one\r\nside, and the boring tools on the other. At a level of 48 feet above the\r\nplatform are placed supports for the wooden spears to which the boring\r\ntools are attached. The machinery for boring is worked by a cylinder,\r\nwhich has a diameter of 39-1/3 inches, and a full stroke of 39-1/3\r\ninches, the usual stroke varying from 2 feet to 3 feet. A massive beam\r\nof wood transmits motion from this cylinder to the boring apparatus, the\r\nconnection between the beam and the piston-rod and the beam and the\r\nboring tools being made by a chain. The engine-man sits close to the\r\nengine, and applies the steam above the piston only. The down stroke of\r\nthe boring tools is caused by the sudden opening of the exhaust, and a\r\nframe then prevents the shock of the boring rods from being too severe.\r\nThe engines work at speeds varying from 12 to 18 strokes a minute,\r\naccording to the character of the strata passed through.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Small Trepan.\r\n\r\nFig. 122.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Small Trepan.\r\n\r\nFig. 123.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Small Trepan.\r\n\r\nFig. 124.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plan of Guide B.\r\n\r\nFig. 125.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Swivelled Ring Front Elevation.\r\n\r\nFig. 126.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Swivelled Ring Side Elevation.\r\n\r\nFig. 127.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Large Trepan Front Elevation.\r\n\r\nFig. 128.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Large Trepan Side Elevation.\r\n\r\nFig. 129.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Large Trepan Component,\r\n\r\nFig. 130.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Trepan Teeth.\r\n\r\nFigs. 131-134.]\r\n\r\nAfter the working platform is fixed, the first boring tool applied is\r\nthe small trepan, Figs. 122 to 125. This tool is attached to the wooden\r\nbeam by the same arrangement shown by Fig. 109. The boring tools can be\r\nlowered at pleasure by means of an adjusting screw. Next in order comes\r\nthe handle for boring. This is worked by four men on the platform, and\r\nis turned by the aid of a swivel. Attached to the handle-piece are\r\nwooden rods, made from Riga pitch pine. These rods are 59 feet in length\r\nand 7-3/4 inches square. A swivelled ring, Figs. 126, 127, is attached\r\nto the rope when raising and lowering the boring rods. The small trepan\r\ncuts a hole 4 feet 8-3/4 inches in diameter, and has fourteen teeth,\r\nfitted in cylindrical holes and secured by pins entering through\r\ncircular slots. The teeth are steeled. At a distance of 4 feet 4 inches\r\nabove the main teeth of the trepan there is an arm, with a tooth at each\r\nend. This piece answers the purpose of a guide, and at the same time\r\nremoves irregularities from the sides of the hole. At a distance of 13\r\nfeet 6 inches above the main teeth are the actual guides, consisting of\r\ntwo strong arms of iron fixed on the tool, and placed at right-angles to\r\neach other. The hole made by the small trepan is not kept at any fixed\r\ndistance in advance of the full-sized pit, but the distance generally\r\nvaries from 10 to 30 yards. With the small trepan, which weighs 8 tons,\r\nthe progress varies from 6 to 10 feet a day.\r\n\r\nThe large trepan, Figs. 128 to 130, weighs 16-1/2 tons, is forged in\r\none solid piece, and has twenty-eight teeth. A projection of iron forms\r\nthe centre of this trepan, and fits loosely into the hole made by the\r\nsmall trepan, acting as a guide for the tool. At a distance of 7 feet 6\r\ninches above the teeth, a guide is sometimes fixed on the frame, but is\r\nnot furnished with teeth. At a distance of 13 feet 3 inches from the\r\nteeth are two other guides at right-angles to each other. These guides\r\nare let down the pit with the boring tool, the hinged part of the guides\r\nbeing raised whilst passing through the beams at the top of the pit,\r\nwhich are only 6 feet 7 inches apart. When the tool is ready to work,\r\nthe two arms are let down against the side of the pit, and are hung in\r\nthe shaft by ropes, thus acting as a guide for the trepan, which moves\r\nthrough them. To provide against a shock to the spears when the trepan\r\nstrikes the rock on the down stroke, at the upper part of the frame a\r\nslot motion is arranged, the play of which amounts to about half an\r\ninch. The teeth of the large trepan are not horizontal, but are deeper\r\ntowards the inside of the pit, the face of the inside tooth being 3-3/4\r\ninches lower than the outside. The object of this is to cause the\r\n_débris_ to drop at once into the small hole, by the face of the rock at\r\nthe bottom of the pit being somewhat inclined. The teeth used, Figs. 131\r\nto 134, are the same both for the large and the small trepan, and weigh\r\nabout 72 lb. each. As a rule, only one set of teeth is kept in use, this\r\nset working for twelve hours, the alternate twelve hours being employed\r\nin raising the _débris_. This time is divided in about the following\r\nproportions;--Boring, twelve hours; drawing the rods, one hour to five\r\nhours, according to depth; raising the _débris_, two hours; and lowering\r\nthe rods one hour to five hours. The maximum speed of the larger trepan\r\nmay be taken at about 3 feet a day. The ordinary distance sunk is not\r\nmore than 2 feet a day, and in flint and other hard rocks the boring has\r\nproceeded as slowly as 3 inches a day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tools used in Boring.\r\n\r\nFigs. 135, 136.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Epicycloidal Hook.\r\n\r\nFigs. 137, 138.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rod Disconnection Key.\r\n\r\nFigs. 139, 140.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Connections to the Trepan and Spears or Rods.\r\n\r\nFig. 141, 142.]\r\n\r\nThe _débris_ in the small bore-hole contains pieces of a maximum size of\r\nabout 8 cubic inches. In the large boring, pieces of rock measuring 32\r\ncubic inches have been found. As a rule, however, the material is beaten\r\nvery fine, having much the appearance of mud or sand. In both the large\r\nand the small borings the _débris_ is raised by a shell, similar to\r\nFigs. 105, 106, and in this system consisting of a wrought-iron\r\ncylinder, 3 feet 3 inches in diameter by 6 feet 9 inches long, and\r\ncontaining two flap-valves at the bottom, through which the excavated\r\nmaterial enters. This apparatus is passed down the shaft by the\r\nbore-rods, and it is moved up and down through a distance varying from 6\r\nto 8 inches, for about a quarter of an hour, and is then drawn up and\r\nemptied. In some cases where the rock is hard, three sizes of trepan are\r\nused consecutively, the sizes being 5 feet, 8 feet, and 13 feet.\r\n\r\nThe several other tools and appliances used during the boring operations\r\nare shown, Figs. 135 to 140, including the key, Figs. 139, 140, used at\r\nthe surface to disconnect the rods, the hook on which each rod is hung\r\nafter being raised to the high platform and there detached, the bar upon\r\nwhich the hooks are moved, and the fork for suspending the rods or\r\ntools from the rollers when it is desired to move the rods or tools from\r\nabove the shaft.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Connections to the Trepan and Spears or Rods.\r\n\r\nFigs. 143-146.]\r\n\r\nFigs. 141 to 146 are of the connections to the trepan and spears or\r\nrods.\r\n\r\nShould broken tools fall into the shaft, several varieties of apparatus\r\nare used for their recovery. In case of broken rods of any kind having a\r\nprotuberance that can be clutched, a hook or crow, Figs. 137, 138, of an\r\nepicycloidal form, enables the object to be taken hold of very readily.\r\nWhere the broken part has no shoulder which can be held, but is simply a\r\nbar, the apparatus shown by Figs. 147, 148, is employed. This is\r\ncomposed of two parts. The rods, the bottom of which have teeth inside,\r\nare prevented from diverging by the cone and slide on the main rods.\r\nWhen passed over a rod or pipe, they clutch it by means of the teeth,\r\nand draw it up. Chaudron has, by this tool, raised a column of pipes 295\r\nfeet in length and 8 inches in diameter. An instrument, called a\r\n\"grapin,\" Figs. 149, 150, is used for raising broken teeth or other\r\nsmall objects which may have fallen into the bottom of the shaft. This\r\ntool also has one part sliding in the other, and is lowered with the\r\nclaws closed. The parts are moved by two ropes worked from the surface.\r\nBy weighting the cross-bar, which is attached to the moving parts, the\r\npressure desired can be exerted on the claws. The weight is then lifted,\r\nthe claws are opened, and are made to close upon the substance to be\r\nraised. This instrument is now seldom required.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pipe or Rod Recovery Tool.\r\n\r\nFigs. 147, 148.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Grapin.\r\n\r\nFigs. 149, 150.]\r\n\r\nIn boring shafts in the manner described, without being able to prove in\r\nthe usual way the perpendicularity of the shaft, it might be feared that\r\nthe system would be open to objection on this account. It appears,\r\nhowever, that in all cases where Chaudron has sunk shafts by this system\r\nhe has succeeded in making them perfectly vertical. This is ensured by\r\nthe natural effect of the treble guide, which the chisels and the two\r\nsets of arms attached to the boring tools afford, and by the fact that\r\nif the least divergence from a plumb-line is made by the boring tool,\r\nthe friction of the tool upon one side of the shaft is so great as to\r\ncause the borers to be unable to turn the instrument.\r\n\r\nBoring alternately with the large and the small instrument, the shaft is\r\nat length sunk to the point at which the lowest feeder of water is\r\nencountered. In a new district this has to be taken, to some extent, at\r\nhazard; but where pits have been sunk previously, it is not difficult to\r\ntell, by observing the strata, almost the exact point at which the\r\nbottom of the tubbing may be safely fixed. This point being ascertained,\r\nthe third process is arrived at.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hydraulic Test Apparatus.\r\n\r\nFig. 151.]\r\n\r\nAs the object of placing tubbing in a shaft is effectually to shut off\r\nthe feeders, which for water supply may have some bad qualities, and to\r\nsecure a water-tight joint at the base, it is important that the bed on\r\nwhich the moss box has to rest should be quite level and smooth. This is\r\nattained by the use of a tool, termed a \"scraper,\" attached to the\r\nbore-rods, the blades being made to move round the face of the bed\r\nintended for the moss box. The tubbing employed is cast in complete\r\ncylinders. At Maurage each ring has an internal diameter of 12 feet and\r\nis 4 feet 9 inches high. Each ring has an inside flange at the top and\r\nbottom, and also a rib in the middle, the top and bottom of the ring\r\nbeing turned and faced. The rings of tubbing are attached to each other\r\nby twenty-eight bolts 1·1 inch in diameter, passed through holes bored\r\nin the flanges. The tubbing is suspended in the pit by means of six\r\nrods, which are let down by capstans placed at a distance of 30 feet\r\nabove the top of the pit. These machines work upon long screws. When a\r\nnew ring of tubbing is added, the rods are detached at a lower level,\r\nand are hung upon chains, thus leaving an open space for passing it\r\nforward. Before each ring is put into the pit it is tested by hydraulic\r\napparatus, Fig. 151. The tubbing is usually proved to one-half more\r\npressure than it is expected to be subjected to. At Maurage, where a\r\nlength of 550 feet of tubbing has to be put in, the chief particulars\r\nrespecting it are;--\r\n\r\n  +-----------+---------+------------+--------------+--------------+\r\n  |           |         |            |              |   Pressure   |\r\n  |           |         |            |   Pressure   |   at which   |\r\n  |           | Length. | Thickness. |   expected.  |  Tubbing is  |\r\n  |           |         |            |              |   proved.    |\r\n  +-----------+---------+------------+--------------+--------------+\r\n  |           |         |            |    lbs. a    |    lbs. a    |\r\n  |           |  feet.  |   inches.  | square inch. | square inch. |\r\n  |           |         |            |              |              |\r\n  | Top       |   130   |    1·17    |      30      |      45      |\r\n  |           |    60   |    1·31    |      60      |      90      |\r\n  |           |    60   |    1·57    |      90      |     135      |\r\n  |           |    60   |    1·76    |     120      |     180      |\r\n  |           |    60   |    1·96    |     150      |     225      |\r\n  |           |    60   |    2·16    |     180      |     270      |\r\n  |           |    60   |    2·35    |     210      |     315      |\r\n  | Bottom    |    60   |    2·55    |     240      |     360      |\r\n  +-----------+---------+------------+--------------+--------------+\r\n\r\nThe joints between the rings of tubbing are made with sheet lead\r\none-eighth of an inch thick, coated with red-lead. The lead is allowed\r\nto obtrude from the joint one-third of an inch, and is wedged up by a\r\ntool which has a face one-twelfth of an inch thick. The mode of\r\nsuspending the tubbing to the rods will be understood by referring to\r\nFigs. 152 to 154. The rods are attached to a ring by the bolts\r\nconnecting one ring of tubbing with another. The bottom ring of tubbing\r\nand the ring carrying the moss box have their top flange turned inwards,\r\nbut their bottom flange outwards. A strong web of iron, forming the\r\nbase of a tube 16-1/2 inches in diameter, is attached to the tubbing.\r\nThe object of this tube is to cause the water in the shaft to ease the\r\nsuspension rods, by bearing part of the weight of the tubbing. Cocks to\r\nadmit water are placed at intervals up the tube, by which means the\r\nweight upon the rods can be easily regulated, so that not more than\r\none-tenth to one-twentieth of the weight of the tubbing is suspended by\r\nthe rods at one time. The ring holding the moss box is hung from the\r\nbottom joint in the tubbing by sliding rods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mode of Suspending the Tubbing to the Rods.\r\n\r\nFigs. 152-154.]\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of the moss box which forms the base of the tubbing is\r\none of the most important points requiring attention in this system of\r\nsinking. Ordinary peat moss is used. It is enclosed in a net, which,\r\nwith the aid of springs, keeps it in its place during the descent of the\r\ntubbing. When the moss box, which hangs on short rods fixed to the\r\ntubbing, reaches the face of rock, it is dropped gently upon it, and the\r\nwhole weight of the tubbing is allowed to rest upon the bed. This\r\ncompresses the moss, the capacity of the chamber holding it is\r\ndiminished, and the moss is forced against the sides of the shaft, thus\r\nforming a water-tight joint, past which no water can escape. This\r\ncompletes the third process.\r\n\r\nIt may be noted that up to this point the following important\r\ndifferences between this and the ordinary system of placing tubbing are\r\nto be observed;--The tubbing, on reaching its bed, bears the aggregate\r\npressure of all the feeders of water which have been met with in the\r\nshaft. The tubbing, having been passed down the shaft in the manner\r\ndescribed, no wedging behind, or other modes of consolidating it in the\r\nshaft, have been carried out. The connection between each ring of\r\ntubbing is so carefully made, that the repeated wedging of the joints,\r\nas in the ordinary system, is rendered unnecessary. The pit is still\r\nfull of water up to the ordinary level.\r\n\r\nUnder these conditions the next process is;--The introduction of cement\r\nbehind the tubbing to complete its solidity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Close Ladle,\r\n\r\nFigs. 155, 156.]\r\n\r\nBefore the water is removed, the annular space between the tubbing and\r\nthe sides of the shaft is filled with hydraulic cement, to render the\r\ntubbing impermeable, by a process of consolidation, less liable to the\r\neffect of any pressure of water or gas which may be exerted towards the\r\ncentre of the shaft. The cement is inserted behind the tubbing by close\r\nladles, Figs. 155, 156, capable of holding 44 gallons, and consisting of\r\ntwo iron plates, one-eighth of an inch thick, fixed on two wooden\r\nuprights 3-1/8 inches square. This apparatus is curved to suit the mean\r\ncircumference of the space to be concreted. A piston is placed at the\r\ntop of the ladle, and to this piston is attached a rod, which can be\r\nmoved from the surface; a door is also attached to the piston. The ladle\r\ncontaining the concrete is passed down behind the tubbing by means of a\r\nwindlass at the surface, and when it reaches the lowest point, the\r\npiston is pushed down and the cement allowed to escape from the chamber.\r\nThe weight of the cement and the ladle is sufficient with a little\r\nballast to enable it to descend easily.\r\n\r\nA number of experiments have been made to discover a cement which will\r\nnot harden too quickly, and which, when hardened, will form a perfectly\r\ncompact and solid mass. A composition having the following proportions\r\nhas been found the best;--Hydraulic lime, from the lias near Metz,\r\nslaked by sprinkling, 1 part; picked sand, from the Vosges sandstone, 1\r\npart; trass, from Andernacht on the Rhine, 1 part; cement from Ropp\r\n(Haute Saone), 1/4 part.\r\n\r\nSix men are employed in putting in the cement;--two at the windlass for\r\nletting down the ladle, two for working the rods attached to the piston,\r\nand two on the working platform. The rods referred to have been found\r\nsuch an inconvenience, that lately a rope on another windlass has been\r\nused, and an appliance arranged for dropping the piston by moving the\r\nrope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sectional Elevation showing Base to the Tubbing.\r\n\r\nFig. 157.]\r\n\r\nWhen a sufficient time has elapsed for the cement to harden, the water\r\nwithin the tubbing, now effectually separated from the feeders, is drawn\r\nout by a bucket worked by the crab engine,--an operation which occupies\r\nfrom one to three weeks, according to circumstances. When concluded, the\r\njoint between the moss box and the rock bed can be examined. In some\r\ncases this joint is considered sufficient; but it is generally thought\r\ndesirable to form a base to the tubbing by building a few feet of\r\nbrickwork in cement on a ring or crib of wood, as in Fig. 157. Another\r\nwooden crib is then placed on the top of this brickwork, and above\r\nthis, two cast-iron segmental wedging cribs with a broad bed also wedged\r\nperfectly tight. On the base so prepared, four or more rings of tubbing\r\nin segments are fixed, the top ring coming close against the bottom of\r\nthe moss box. This being done the work is completed, and the sinking of\r\nthe shaft is continued in the ordinary way.\r\n\r\nThe application of the boring trepan is not to be recommended in the\r\nsinking of the dry part of the shaft. The use of the tool would cause\r\nthe sinking to extend over a longer period, since the breaking of the\r\nrock passed through into such minute particles would lead to loss of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRU'S SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dru's System.\r\n\r\nSectional Elevation showing Surface Arrangement.\r\n\r\nFig. 158.]\r\n\r\nThe system applied by Dru is worthy of attention, not so much on account\r\nof the novelty of the invention, or of any new principle involved in it,\r\nas on account of the contrivances it contains for the application of the\r\ntool, \"_à chute libre_,\" or the free-falling tool, to Artesian wells of\r\nlarge diameters. It has been already explained that under Kind's\r\narrangements the trepan was thrown out of gear by the reaction of the\r\nwater which was allowed to find its way into the column of the\r\nexcavation; but that it is not always possible to command the supply of\r\nthe quantity necessary for that purpose; and even when possible, the\r\nclutch Kind adopted was so shaped as to be subject to much and rapid\r\nwear. Dru, with a view to obviate both these inconveniences, made his\r\nfirst trepan similar to that shown in Fig. 101, in which it will be seen\r\nthat the tool was gradually raised until it came in contact with the\r\nfixed part of the upper machinery, when it was thrown out of gear. The\r\nbearings of the clutch were parallel to the horizontal line, and were\r\nfound in practice to be more evenly worn, so that this instrument could\r\nbe worked sometimes from eight days to fourteen days without\r\nintermission; whereas, on Kind's system, the trepan was frequently\r\nwithdrawn after two days' or three days' service.\r\n\r\nWe take the following complete account of the system from a paper read\r\nby M. Dru at the Conservatoire des Arts et Métiers, Paris, 6th June,\r\n1867.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from Figs. 158, 159, that the boring rod A is suspended\r\nfrom the outer end of the working beam B, which is made of timber hooped\r\nwith iron, working upon a middle bearing, and is connected at the inner\r\nend to the vertical steam cylinder C, of 10 inches diameter and 39\r\ninches stroke. The stroke of the boring rod is reduced to 22 inches, by\r\nthe inner end of the beam being made longer than the outer end, serving\r\nas a partial counterbalance for the weight of the boring rod. The steam\r\ncylinder is shown enlarged in Fig. 160, and is single-acting, being used\r\nonly to lift the boring rod at each stroke, and the rod is lowered\r\nagain by releasing the steam from the top side of the piston; the stroke\r\nis limited by timber stops both below and above the end of the working\r\nbeam B.\r\n\r\nThe boring tool is the part of most importance in the apparatus, and the\r\none that has involved most difficulty in maturing its construction. The\r\npoints to be aimed at in this are,--simplicity of construction and\r\nrepairs; the greatest force of blow possible for each unit of striking\r\nsurface; and freedom from liability to get turned aside and choked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Elevation showing Beam connected to Rods,\r\n\r\nFig. 159.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Steam Cylinder.\r\n\r\nFig. 160.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Single Chisels.\r\n\r\nFigs. 161, 162.]\r\n\r\nThe tool used in small borings is a single chisel, as shown in Figs.\r\n161, 162; but for the large borings it is found best to divide the\r\ntool-face into separate chisels, each of convenient size and weight for\r\nforging. All the chisels, however, are kept in a straight line, whereby\r\nthe extent of striking surface is reduced; and the tool is rendered less\r\nliable to be turned aside by meeting a hard portion of flint on a single\r\npoint of the striking edge, which would diminish the effect of the blow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tools for Large Borings.\r\n\r\nFigs. 163-169.]\r\n\r\nThe tool is shown in Figs. 163 to 169, and is composed of a wrought-iron\r\nbody D, connected by a screwed end E to the boring rod, and carrying the\r\nchisels F F, fixed in separate sockets and secured by nuts above; two\r\nor four chisels are used, or sometimes even a greater number, according\r\nto the size of the hole to be bored. This construction allows of any\r\nbroken chisel being easily replaced; and also, by changing the breadth\r\nof the two outer chisels, the diameter of the hole bored can be\r\nregulated exactly as may be desired. When four chisels are used, the two\r\ncentre ones are made a little longer than the others, as shown in Fig.\r\n167, to form a leading hole as a guide to the boring rod. A cross-bar G,\r\nof the same width as the tool, guides it in the hole in the direction at\r\nright-angles to the tool; and in the case of the larger and longer tools\r\na second cross-bar higher up, at right-angles to the first and parallel\r\nto the striking edge of the tool, is also added.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Free-falling tools.\r\n\r\nFigs. 170-173.]\r\n\r\nIf the whole length of the boring rod were allowed to fall suddenly to\r\nthe bottom of a large bore-hole at each stroke, frequent breakages\r\nwould occur; it is therefore found requisite to arrange for the tool to\r\nbe detached from the boring rod at a fixed point in each stroke, and\r\nthis has led to the general adoption of _free-falling tools_. M. Dru's\r\nplan of self-acting free-falling tool, liberated by reaction, is shown\r\nin side and front view in Figs. 170 to 173. The hook H, attached to the\r\nhead of the boring tool D, slides vertically in the box K, which is\r\nscrewed to the lower extremity of the boring rod; and the hook engages\r\nwith the catch J, centred in the sides of the box K, whereby the tool is\r\nlifted as the boring rod rises. The tail of the catch J bears against an\r\ninclined plane L, at the top of the box K; and the two holes carrying\r\nthe centre-pin I of the catch, are made oval in the vertical direction,\r\nso as to allow a slight vertical movement of the catch. When the boring\r\nrod reaches the top of the stroke, it is stopped suddenly by the tail\r\nend of the beam B, Fig. 159, striking upon the wood buffer-block E; and\r\nthe shock thus occasioned causes a slight jump of the catch J in the box\r\nK; the tail of the catch is thereby thrown outwards by the incline L, as\r\nshown in Fig. 172, liberating the hook H, and the tool then falls freely\r\nto the bottom of the bore-hole, as shown in Fig. 173. When the boring\r\nrod descends again after the tool, the catch J again engages with the\r\nhook H, enabling the tool to be raised for the next blow, as in Fig.\r\n171.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Self-acting Free-falling Tools.\r\n\r\nFigs. 174-178.]\r\n\r\nAnother construction of self-acting free-falling tool, liberated by a\r\nseparate disengaging rod, is shown in side and front view in Figs. 174\r\nto 178. This tool consists of four principal pieces, the hook H, the\r\ncatch J, the pawl I, and the disengaging rod M. The hook H, carrying the\r\nboring tool D, slides between the two vertical sides of the box K, which\r\nis screwed to the bottom of the boring rod; and the catch J works in the\r\nsame space upon a centre-pin fixed in the box, so that the tool is\r\ncarried by the rod, when hooked on the catch, as shown in Fig. 175. At\r\nthe same time the pawl I, at the back of the catch J, secures it from\r\ngetting unhooked from the tool; but this pawl is centred in a separate\r\nsliding hoop N, forming the top of the disengaging rod M, which slides\r\nfreely up and down within a fixed distance upon the box K; and in its\r\nlowest position the hoop N rests upon the upper of the two guides P P,\r\nFig. 174, through which the disengaging rod M slides outside the box K.\r\nIn lowering the boring rod, the disengaging rod M reaches the bottom of\r\nthe bore-hole first, as shown in Figs. 174, 175, and being then stopped\r\nit prevents the pawl I from descending any lower; and the inclined back\r\nof the catch J sliding down past the pawl, the latter forces the catch\r\nout of the hook H, as shown in Fig. 176, thus allowing the tool D to\r\nfall freely and strike its blow. The height of fall of the tool is\r\nalways the same, being determined only by the length of the disengaging\r\nrod M.\r\n\r\nThe blow having been struck, and the boring rod continuing to be lowered\r\nto the bottom of the hole, the catch J falls back into its original\r\nposition, and engages again with the hook H, as shown in Fig. 177, ready\r\nfor lifting the tool in the next stroke. As the boring rod rises, the\r\ntail of the catch J trips up the pawl I in passing, as shown in Fig.\r\n176, allowing the catch to pass freely; and the pawl before it begins to\r\nbe lifted returns to the original position, shown in Fig. 177, where it\r\nlocks the catch J, and prevents any risk of its becoming unhooked either\r\nin raising or lowering the tool in the well.\r\n\r\nThe boring tool shown in Figs. 163, 164, which was employed for boring a\r\nwell of 19 inches diameter, weighs 3/4 ton, and is liberated by\r\nreaction, by the arrangement shown in Figs. 170 to 173; and the same\r\nmode of liberation was applied in the first instance to the larger tool,\r\nshown in Figs. 166 to 169, employed in sinking a well of 47 in. diameter\r\nat Butte-aux-Cailles. The great weight of the latter tool, however,\r\namounting to as much as 3-1/2 tons, necessitated so violent a shock for\r\nthe purpose of liberating the tool by reaction, that the boring rods and\r\nthe rest of the apparatus would have been damaged by a continuance of\r\nthat mode of working; and M. Dru was therefore led to design the\r\narrangement of the disengaging rod for releasing the tool, as shown in\r\nFigs. 174, 175. In this case the cross-guide G fixed upon the tool is\r\nmade with an eye for the disengaging rod M to work through freely. For\r\nborings of small diameter, however, the disengaging rod cannot supersede\r\nthe reaction system of liberation, as the latter alone is able to work\r\nin borings as small as 3-1/4 inches diameter; and a bore-hole no larger\r\nthan this diameter has been successfully completed by M. Dru with the\r\nreaction tool to a depth of 750 feet.\r\n\r\nThe boring rods employed are of two kinds, wrought-iron and wood. The\r\nwood rods seen in Figs. 159, 179, are used for borings of large\r\ndiameter, as they possess the advantage of having a larger section for\r\nstiffness without increasing the weight; and also when immersed in water\r\nthe greater portion of their weight is floated. The wood for the rods\r\nrequires to be carefully selected, and care has to be taken to choose\r\nthe timber from the thick part of the tree, and not the toppings. In\r\nFrance, Lorraine, or Vosges, deals are preferred.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lantern.\r\n\r\nFig. 179.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Boring Rod Sockets.\r\n\r\nFigs. 180-182.]\r\n\r\nThe boring rods, whether of wood or iron, are screwed together either by\r\nsolid sockets, as in Fig. 181, or with separate collars, as in Figs.\r\n180, 182. The separate collars are preferred for the purpose, on account\r\nof being easy to forge; and also because, as only one half of the collar\r\nworks in coupling and uncoupling the rods, while the other half is\r\nfixed, the screw-thread becomes worn only at one end, and by changing\r\nthe collar, end for end, a new thread is obtained when one is worn out,\r\nthe worn end being then jammed fast as the fixed end of the collar.\r\n\r\nThe boring rod is guided in the lower part of the hole by a lantern R,\r\nFig. 159, shown to a larger scale in Fig. 179, which consists of four\r\nvertical iron bars curved in at both ends, where they are secured by\r\nmovable sockets upon the boring rod, and fixed by a nut at the top. By\r\nchanging the bars, the size of the lantern is readily adjusted to any\r\nrequired diameter of bore-hole, as indicated by the dotted lines. In\r\nraising up or letting down the boring rod, two lengths of about 30 feet\r\neach are detached or added at once, and a few shorter rods of different\r\nlengths are used to make up the exact length required. The coupling\r\nscrew S, Fig. 158, by which the boring rod is connected to the working\r\nbeam B, serves to complete the adjustment of length; this is turned by a\r\ncross-bar, and then secured by a cross-pin through the screw.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Conical Socket.\r\n\r\nFig. 183.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Crow's Foot.\r\n\r\nFig. 184.]\r\n\r\nIn ordinary work, breakages of the boring rod generally take place in\r\nthe iron, and more particularly at the part screwed, as that is the\r\nweakest part. In the case of breakages, the tools usually employed for\r\npicking up the broken ends are a conical screwed socket, shown in Fig.\r\n183, and a crow's foot, shown in Fig. 184; the socket being made with an\r\nordinary V-thread for cases where the breakage occurs in the iron; but\r\nhaving a sharper thread, like a wood screw, when used where the breakage\r\nis in one of the wood rods. In order to ascertain the shape of the\r\nfractured end left in the bore-hole, and its position relatively to the\r\ncentre line of the hole, a similar conical socket is first lowered,\r\nhaving its under surface filled up level with wax, so as to take an\r\nimpression of the broken end, and show what size of screwed socket\r\nshould be employed for getting it up. Tools with nippers are sometimes\r\nused in large borings, as it is not advisable to subject the rods to a\r\ntwist.\r\n\r\nWhen the boring tool has detached a sufficient quantity of material, the\r\nboring rod and tool are drawn up by means of the rope O, Fig. 158,\r\nwinding upon the drum Q, which is driven by straps and gearing from the\r\nsteam-engine T. A shell is then lowered into the bore-hole by the\r\nwire-rope U, from the other drum V, and is afterwards drawn up again\r\nwith the excavated material. A friction break is applied to the drum Q,\r\nfor regulating the rate of lowering the boring rod down the well. The\r\nshell shown in Figs. 186, 187, consists of a riveted iron cylinder, with\r\na handle at the top, which can either be screwed to the boring rod or\r\nattached to the wire-rope; and the bottom is closed by a large valve,\r\nopening inwards. Two different forms of valve are used, either a pair of\r\nflap-valves, as shown in Fig. 186, or a single-cone valve, Fig. 187; and\r\nthe bottom ring of the cylinder, forming the seating of the valve, is\r\nforged solid, and steeled on the lower edge. On lowering this cylinder\r\nto the bottom of the bore-hole, the valve opens, and the loose material\r\nenters the cylinder, where it is retained by the closing of the valve,\r\nwhilst the shell is drawn up again to the surface. In boring through\r\nchalk, as in the case of the deep wells in the Paris basin, the hole is\r\nfirst made of about half the final diameter for 60 to 90 feet depth, and\r\nit is then enlarged to the full diameter by using a larger tool. This is\r\ndone for convenience of working; for if the whole area were acted upon\r\nat once, it would involve crushing all the flints in the chalk; but, by\r\nputting a shell in the advanced hole, the flints that are detached\r\nduring the working of the second larger tool are received in the shell\r\nand removed by it, without getting broken by the tool.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Shells.\r\n\r\nFigs. 185-187.]\r\n\r\nThe resistance experienced in boring through different strata is\r\nvarious; and some rocks passed through are so hard, that with 12,000\r\nblows a day of a boring tool weighing nearly 10 cwt., with 19 inches\r\nheight of fall, the bore-hole was advanced only 3 to 4 inches a day. As\r\nthe opposite case, strata of running sand have been met with so wet,\r\nthat a slight movement of the rod at the bottom of the hole was\r\nsufficient to make the sand rise 30 to 40 feet in the bore-hole. In\r\nthese cases Dru has adopted the Chinese method of effecting a speedy\r\nclearance, by means of a shell closed by a large ball-clack at the\r\nbottom, as shown in Fig. 186, and suspended by a rope, to which a\r\nvertical movement is given; each time the shell falls upon the sand a\r\nportion of this is forced up into the cylinder, and retained there by\r\nthe ball-valve.\r\n\r\nBorings of large diameter, for mines or other shafts, are also sunk by\r\nmeans of the same description of boring tools, only considerably\r\nincreased in size, extending up to as much as 14 feet diameter. The well\r\nis then lined with cast-iron or wrought-iron tubing, for the purpose of\r\nmaking it water-tight; and a special contrivance, invented by Kind, and\r\nalluded to at p. 110, has been adopted for making a water-tight joint\r\nbetween the tubing and the bottom of the well, or with another portion\r\nof tubing previously lowered down. This is done by a stuffing-box, shown\r\nin Fig. 188, which contains a packing of moss at A A. The upper portion\r\nof the tubing is drawn down to the lower portion by the tightening\r\nscrews B B, so as to compress the moss-packing when the weight is not\r\nsufficient for the purpose. A space C is left between the tubing and the\r\nside of the well, to admit of the passage of the stuffing-box flange,\r\nand also for running in concrete for the completion of the operation.\r\nThe moss-packing rests upon the bottom flange D; but this flange is\r\nsometimes omitted. The joint is thus simply made by pressing out the\r\nmoss-packing against the sides of the well; and this material, being\r\neasily compressible and not liable to decay under water, is found to\r\nmake a very satisfactory and durable joint.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Stuffing-box.\r\n\r\nFig. 188.]\r\n\r\nM. Dru states that the reaction tool has been successfully employed for\r\nborings up to as large as about 4 feet diameter, witness the case of the\r\nwell at Butte-aux-Cailles of 47 inches diameter; but beyond that size he\r\nconsiders the shock requisite to liberate the larger and heavier tool\r\nwould probably be so excessive, as to be injurious to the boring rods\r\nand the rest of the attachments; and he therefore designed the\r\narrangement of the disengaging rod for liberating the tool in borings of\r\nlarge diameter, whereby all shock upon the boring rods was avoided and\r\nthe tool was liberated with complete certainty.\r\n\r\nIn practice it is necessary, as with the common chisel, to turn the\r\nboring tool partly round between each stroke, so as to prevent it from\r\nfalling every time in the same position at the bottom of the well; and\r\nthis was effected in the well at Butte-aux-Cailles by manual power at\r\nthe top of the well, by means of a long hand-lever fixed to the boring\r\nrod by a clip bolted on, which was turned round by a couple of men\r\nthrough part of a revolution during the time that the tool was being\r\nlifted. The turning was ordinarily done in the right-hand direction\r\nonly, so as to avoid the risk of unscrewing any of the screwed couplings\r\nof the boring rods; and care was taken to give the boring rod half a\r\nturn when the tool was at the bottom, so as to tighten the\r\nscrew-couplings, which otherwise might shake loose. In the event of a\r\nfracture, however, leaving a considerable length of boring rod in the\r\nhole, it was sometimes necessary to have the means of unscrewing the\r\ncouplings of the portion left in the hole, so as to raise it in parts\r\ninstead of all at once. In that case a locking clip was added at each\r\nscrewed joint above, and secured by bolts, as shown at C in Fig. 180, at\r\nthe time of putting the rods together for lowering them down the well to\r\nrecover the broken portion; and by this means the ends of the rods were\r\nprevented from becoming unscrewed in the coupling sockets, when the rods\r\nwere turned round backwards for unscrewing the joints in the broken\r\nlength at the bottom of the bore-hole.\r\n\r\nWhen running sands are met with, the plan adopted is to use the Chinese\r\nball-scoop, or shell, Fig. 186, described for clearing the bottom of the\r\nbore-hole; and where there is too much sand for it to be got rid of in\r\nthis way, a tube has to be sent down from the surface to shut off the\r\nsand. This, of course, necessitates diminishing the diameter of the hole\r\nin passing through the sand; but on reaching the solid rock below the\r\nrunning sand, an expanding tool is used for continuing the bore-hole\r\nbelow the tubing with the same diameter as above it, so as to allow the\r\ntubing to go down with the hole.\r\n\r\nIn the case of meeting with a surface of very hard rock at a\r\nconsiderable inclination to the bore-hole, M. Dru employs a tool, the\r\ncutters of which are fixed in a circle all round the edge of the tool,\r\ninstead of in a single diameter line; the length of the tool is also\r\nconsiderably increased in such cases, as compared with the tools used\r\nfor ordinary work, so that it is guided for a length of as much as 20\r\nfeet. He uses this tool in all cases where from any cause the hole is\r\nfound to be going crooked, and has even succeeded by this means in\r\nstraightening a hole that had previously been bored crooked.\r\n\r\nThe cutting action of this tool is all round its edge; and therefore in\r\nmeeting with an inclined hard surface, as there is nothing to cut on the\r\nlower side, the force of the blow is brought to bear on the upper side\r\nalone, until an entrance is effected into the hard rock in a true\r\nstraight line with the upper part of the hole.\r\n\r\nAlthough as regards diameter, depth, and flow of water in favourable\r\nlocalities, some extraordinary results have been obtained with this\r\nsystem of boring by rods worked by steam power, yet, as Dru himself\r\nobserves, \"in some instances his own experience of boring had been, that\r\nowing to the difficulties attending the operation, the occurrence of\r\ndelays from accidents was the rule, while the regular working of the\r\nmachinery was the exception.\" A further disadvantage to be noticed is\r\nthat, owing to the time and labour involved in raising and lowering\r\nheavy rods in borings of 10 inches diameter and upwards, there is a\r\nstrong inducement to keep the boring tool at work for a much longer\r\nperiod than is actually necessary for breaking-up fresh material at each\r\nstroke. The fact is that after from 100 to 200 blows have been given,\r\nthe boring tool merely falls into the accumulated _débris_ and pounds\r\nthis into dust, without again touching the surface of the solid rock. It\r\nmay therefore be easily understood how much time is totally lost out of\r\nthe periods of five to eight hours during which with the rod system the\r\ntool is allowed to continue working.\r\n\r\n\r\nMATHER AND PLATT'S SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nIn the most recent method of boring adopted in England, the rope\r\nemployed in the Chinese system has been reverted to, in place of the\r\niron or wood rods used on the Continent. A flexible rope admits of being\r\nhandled with greater facility than iron rods, but wants the advantage of\r\nrigidity: in the Chinese method it admitted of withdrawing the chisel or\r\nbucket very rapidly, but gave no certainty to the operation of the\r\nchisel at the bottom of the hole. The rods on the other hand enable a\r\nvery effective blow to be given, with a definite turning or screwing\r\nmotion between the blows according to the requirements of the strata;\r\nbut the time and trouble of raising heavy rods from great depths on each\r\noccasion of changing from boring to clearing out the hole form a serious\r\ndrawback, which makes the stoppages occupy really a longer time than the\r\nactual working of the machinery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Elevation of Mather and Platt Apparatus.\r\n\r\nFig. 189.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Small Boring Machine.\r\n\r\n_Side Elevation._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Small Boring Machine.\r\n\r\n_Plan._\r\n\r\nFigs. 190, 191.]\r\n\r\nThe method invented by Colin Mather, and manufactured by Mather and\r\nPlatt, of Oldham, employed largely in England for deep boring, seems to\r\ncombine the advantages of the systems hitherto used, and to be free from\r\nmany of their disadvantages. The distinctive features of this plan,\r\nwhich is shown in Figs. 189 to 195, are the mode of giving the\r\npercussive action to the boring tool, and the construction of the tool\r\nor boring-head, and of the shell-pump for clearing out the hole after\r\nthe action of the boring-head. Instead of these implements being\r\nattached to rods, they are suspended by a flat hemp-rope, about 1/2 inch\r\nthick and 4-1/2 inches broad, such as is commonly used at collieries;\r\nand the boring tool and shell-pump are raised and lowered as quickly in\r\nthe bore-hole as the bucket and cages in a colliery shaft.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LARGE BORING MACHINE.\r\n\r\n_Longitudinal Section._\r\n\r\nFig. 192.]\r\n\r\nThe flat rope A A, Fig. 189, from which the boring-head B is suspended,\r\nis wound upon a large drum C driven by a steam-engine D with a reversing\r\nmotion, so that one man can regulate the operation with the greatest\r\nease. All the working parts are fitted into a wood or iron framing E E,\r\nrendering the whole a compact and complete machine. On leaving the drum\r\nC the rope passes under a guide pulley F, and then over a large pulley G\r\ncarried in a fork at the top of the piston-rod of a vertical\r\nsingle-acting steam cylinder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Large Boring Machine._\r\n\r\n_Transverse Section._\r\n\r\nFig. 193.]\r\n\r\nThis cylinder, by which the percussive action of the boring-head is\r\nproduced, is shown to a larger scale in the vertical sections, Figs.\r\n192, 193; and in the larger size of machine here shown, the cylinder is\r\nfitted with a piston of 15 inches diameter, having a heavy cast-iron rod\r\n7 inches square, which is made with a fork at the top carrying the\r\nflanged pulley G of about 3 feet diameter and of sufficient breadth for\r\nthe flat rope A to pass over it. The boring-head having been lowered by\r\nthe winding drum to the bottom of the bore-hole, the rope is fixed\r\nsecure at that length by the clamp J; steam is then admitted underneath\r\nthe piston in the cylinder H by the steam valve K, and the boring tool\r\nis lifted by the ascent of the piston-rod and pulley G; and on arriving\r\nat the top of the stroke the exhaust valve L is opened for the steam to\r\nescape, allowing the piston-rod and carrying pulley to fall freely with\r\nthe boring tool, which falls with its full weight to the bottom of the\r\nbore-hole. The exhaust port is 6 inches above the bottom of the\r\ncylinder, while the steam port is situated at the bottom; and there is\r\nthus always an elastic cushion of steam retained in the cylinder of that\r\nthickness for the piston to fall upon, preventing the piston from\r\nstriking the bottom of the cylinder. The steam and exhaust valves are\r\nworked with a self-acting motion by the tappets M M, which are\r\nactuated by the movement of the piston-rod; and a rapid succession of\r\nblows is thus given by the boring tool on the bottom of the bore-hole.\r\nAs it is necessary that motion should be given to the piston before the\r\nvalves can be acted upon, a small jet of steam N is allowed to be\r\nconstantly blowing into the bottom of the cylinder; this causes the\r\npiston to move slowly at first, so as to take up the slack of the rope\r\nand allow it to receive the weight of the boring-head gradually and\r\nwithout a jerk. An arm attached to the piston-rod then comes in contact\r\nwith a tappet which opens the steam valve K, and the piston rises\r\nquickly to the top of the stroke; another tappet worked by the same arm\r\nthen shuts off the steam, and the exhaust valve L is opened by a\r\ncorresponding arrangement on the opposite side of the piston-rod, as\r\nshown in Fig. 193. By shifting these tappets the length of stroke of the\r\npiston can be varied from 1 to 8 feet in the large machine, according to\r\nthe material to be bored through; and the height of fall of the\r\nboring-head at the bottom of the bore-hole is double the length of\r\nstroke of the piston. The fall of the boring-head and piston can also be\r\nregulated by a weighted valve on the exhaust pipe, checking the escape\r\nof the steam, so as to cause the descent to take place slowly or\r\nquickly, as may be desired.\r\n\r\nThe boring-head B, Fig. 189, is shown to a larger scale in Figs. 194,\r\n195, and consists of a wrought-iron bar about 4 inches diameter and 8\r\nfeet long, to the bottom of which a cast-iron cylindrical block C is\r\nsecured. This block has numerous square holes through it, into which the\r\nchisels or cutters D D are inserted with taper shanks, as shown in Fig.\r\n195, so as to be very firm when working, but to be readily taken out for\r\nrepairing and sharpening. Two different arrangements of the cutters are\r\nshown in the elevation, Fig. 194, and the plan, Fig. 196. A little above\r\nthe block C another cylindrical casting E is fixed upon the bar B, which\r\nacts simply as a guide to keep the bar perpendicular. Higher still is\r\nfixed a second guide F, but on the circumference of this are secured\r\ncast-iron plates made with ribs of a saw-tooth or ratchet shape,\r\ncatching only in one direction; these ribs are placed at an inclination\r\nlike segments of a screw-thread of very long pitch, so that as the\r\nguide bears against the rough sides of the bore-hole when the bar is\r\nraised or lowered they assist in turning it, for causing the cutters to\r\nstrike in a fresh place at each stroke. Each alternate plate has the\r\nprojecting ribs inclined in the opposite direction, so that one half of\r\nthe ribs are acting to turn the bar round in rising, and the other half\r\nto turn it in the same direction in falling. These projecting spiral\r\nribs simply assist in turning the bar, and immediately above the upper\r\nguide F is the arrangement by which the definite rotation is secured. To\r\neffect this object two cast-iron collars, G and H, are cottered fast to\r\nthe top of the bar B, and placed about 12 inches apart; the upper face\r\nof the lower collar G is formed with deep ratchet-teeth of about 2\r\ninches pitch, and the under face of the top collar H is formed with\r\nsimilar ratchet-teeth, set exactly in line with those on the lower\r\ncollar. Between these collars and sliding freely on the neck of the\r\nboring bar B is a deep bush J, which is also formed with corresponding\r\nratchet-teeth on both its upper and lower faces; but the teeth on the\r\nupper face are set half a tooth in advance of those on the lower face,\r\nso that the perpendicular side of each tooth on the upper face of the\r\nbush is directly above the centre of the inclined side of a tooth on the\r\nlower face. To this bush is attached the wrought-iron bow K, by which\r\nthe whole boring bar is suspended with a hook and shackle O, Fig. 192,\r\nfrom the end of the flat rope A. The rotary motion of the bar is\r\nobtained as follows: when the boring tool falls and strikes the blow,\r\nthe lifting bush J, which during the lifting has been engaged with the\r\nratchet-teeth of the top collar H, falls upon those of the bottom collar\r\nG, and thereby receives a twist backwards through the space of half a\r\ntooth; and on commencing to lift again, the bush rising up against the\r\nratchet-teeth of the top collar H receives a further twist backwards\r\nthrough half a tooth. The flat rope is thus twisted backwards to the\r\nextent of one tooth of the ratchet; and during the lifting of the tool\r\nit untwists itself again, thereby rotating the boring tool forwards\r\nthrough that extent of twist between each successive blow of the tool.\r\nThe amount of the rotation may be varied by making the ratchet-teeth of\r\ncoarser or finer pitch. The motion is entirely self-acting, and the\r\nrotary movement of the boring tool is ensured with mechanical accuracy.\r\nThis simple and most effective action taking place at every blow of the\r\ntool produces a constant change in the position of the cutters, thus\r\nincreasing their effect in breaking the rock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Boring Head._\r\n\r\n_Elevation._\r\n\r\nFig. 194.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Boring Head._\r\n\r\n_Sectional Elevation._\r\n\r\nFig. 195.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plan at Bottom, Inverted._\r\n\r\nFig. 196.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Shell Pump.\r\n\r\nFigs. 197, 198.]\r\n\r\nThe shell-pump, for raising the material broken up by the boring-head,\r\nis shown in Figs. 197, 198, and consists of a cylindrical shell or\r\nbarrel P of cast-iron, about 8 feet long and a little smaller in\r\ndiameter than the size of the bore-hole. At the bottom is a clack A\r\nopening upwards, somewhat similar to that in ordinary pumps; but its\r\nseating, instead of being fastened to the cylinder P, is in an annular\r\nframe C, which is held up against the bottom of the cylinder by a rod D\r\npassing up to a wrought-iron bridge E at the top, where it is secured by\r\na cotter F. Inside the cylinder works a bucket B, similar to that of a\r\ncommon lift-pump, having an indiarubber disc valve on the top side; and\r\nthe rod D of the bottom clack passes freely through the bucket. The rod\r\nG of the bucket itself is formed like a long link in a chain, and by\r\nthis link the pump is suspended from the shackle O, Fig. 192, at the end\r\nof the flat rope, the bridge E, Fig. 197, preventing the bucket from\r\nbeing drawn out of the cylinder. The bottom clack A is made with an\r\nindiarubber disc, which opens sufficiently to allow the water and\r\nsmaller particles of stone to enter the cylinder; and in order to enable\r\nthe pieces of broken rock to be brought up as large as possible, the\r\nentire clack is free to rise bodily about 6 inches from the annular\r\nframe C, as shown in Fig. 197, thereby affording ample space for large\r\npieces of rock to enter the cylinder, when drawn in by the up stroke of\r\nthe bucket.\r\n\r\nThe general working of the boring machine is as follows. The winding\r\ndrum C, Fig. 189, is 10 feet diameter in the large machine, and is\r\ncapable of holding 3000 feet length of rope 4-1/2 inches broad and 1/2\r\ninch thick. When the boring-head B is hooked on the shackle at the end\r\nof the rope A, its weight pulls round the drum and winding engine, and\r\nby means of a break it is lowered steadily to the bottom of the\r\nbore-hole; the rope is then secured at that length by screwing up tight\r\nthe clamp J. The small steam jet N, Figs. 192, 193, is next turned on,\r\nfor starting the working of the percussion cylinder H; and the\r\nboring-head is then kept continuously at work until it has broken up a\r\nsufficient quantity of material at the bottom of the bore-hole. The\r\nclamp J which grips the rope is made with a slide and screw I, Fig. 192,\r\nwhereby more rope can be gradually given out as the boring-head\r\npenetrates deeper in the hole. In order to increase the lift of the\r\nboring-head, or to compensate for the elastic stretching of the rope,\r\nwhich is found to amount to 1 inch in each 100 feet length, it is simply\r\nnecessary to raise the top pair of tappets on the tappet rods whilst the\r\npercussive motion is in operation. When the boring-head has been kept at\r\nwork long enough, the steam is shut off from the percussion cylinder,\r\nthe rope unclamped, the winding engine put in motion, and the\r\nboring-head wound up to the surface, where it is then slung from an\r\noverhead suspension bar Q, Fig. 189, by means of a hook mounted on a\r\nroller for running the boring-head away to one side, clear of the\r\nbore-hole.\r\n\r\nThe shell-pump is next lowered down the bore-hole by the rope, and the\r\n_débris_ pumped into it by lowering and raising the bucket about three\r\ntimes at the bottom of the hole, which is readily effected by means of\r\nthe reversing motion of the winding engine. The pump is then brought up\r\nto the surface, and emptied by the following very simple arrangement: it\r\nis slung by a traversing hook from the overhead suspension bar Q, Fig.\r\n189, and is brought perpendicularly over a small table E in the waste\r\ntank T; and the table is raised by the screw S until it receives the\r\nweight of the pump. The cotter F, Fig. 197, which holds up the clack\r\nseating C at the bottom of the pump, is then knocked out; and the table\r\nbeing lowered by the screw, the whole clack seating C descends with it,\r\nas shown in Fig. 198, and the contents of the pump are washed out by the\r\nrush of water contained in the pump cylinder. The table is then raised\r\nagain by the screw, replacing the clack seating in its proper position,\r\nin which it is secured by driving the cotter F into the slot at the top;\r\nand the pump is again ready to be lowered down the bore-hole as before.\r\nIt is sometimes necessary for the pump to be emptied and lowered three\r\nor four times in order to remove all the material that has been broken\r\nup by the boring-head at one operation.\r\n\r\nThe rapidity with which these operations may be carried on is found in\r\nthe experience of the working of the machine to be as follows. The\r\nboring-head is lowered at the rate of 500 feet a minute. The percussive\r\nmotion gives twenty-four blows a minute; this rate of working continued\r\nfor about ten minutes in red sandstone and similar strata is sufficient\r\nfor enabling the cutters to penetrate about 6 inches depth, when the\r\nboring-head is wound up again at the rate of 300 feet a minute. The\r\nshell-pump is lowered and raised at the same speeds, but only remains\r\ndown about two minutes; and the emptying of the pump when drawn up\r\noccupies about two or three minutes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Accident Tools.\r\n\r\nFigs. 199-204.]\r\n\r\nIn the construction of this machine it will be seen that the great\r\ndesideratum of all earth boring has been well kept in view; namely, to\r\nbore-holes of large diameter to great depths with rapidity and safety.\r\nThe object is to keep either the boring-head or the shell-pump\r\nconstantly at work at the bottom of the bore-hole, where the actual work\r\nhas to be done; to lose as little time as possible in raising, lowering,\r\nand changing the tools; to expedite all the operations at the surface;\r\nand to economize manual labour in every particular. With this machine,\r\none man standing on a platform at the side of the percussion cylinder\r\nperforms all the operations of raising and lowering by the winding\r\nengine, changing the boring-head and shell-pump, regulating the\r\npercussive action, and clamping or unclamping the rope: all the handles\r\nfor the various steam valves are close to his hand, and the break for\r\nlowering is worked by his foot. Two labourers attend to changing the\r\ncutters and clearing the pump. Duplicate boring-heads and pumps are\r\nslung to the overhead suspension bar Q, Fig. 189, ready for use, thus\r\navoiding all delay when any change is requisite.\r\n\r\nAs is well known by those who have charge of such operations, in well\r\nboring innumerable accidents and stoppages occur from causes which\r\ncannot be prevented, with however much vigilance and skill the\r\noperations may be conducted. Hard and soft strata intermingled,\r\nhighly-inclined rocks, running sands, and fissures and dislocations are\r\nfruitful sources of annoyance and delay, and sometimes of complete\r\nfailure; and it will therefore be interesting to notice a few of the\r\nordinary difficulties arising out of these circumstances. In all the\r\nbore-holes yet executed by this system, the various special instruments\r\nused under any circumstances of accident or complicated strata are fully\r\nshown in Figs. 199 to 207.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Grapnel for Stiff Clay.\r\n\r\nFig. 207.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Straightening Plug for Tubes.\r\n\r\nFig. 205.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Grapnel for Cores.\r\n\r\nFig. 206.]\r\n\r\nThe boring-head while at work may suddenly be jammed fast, either by\r\nbreaking into a fissure, or in consequence of broken rock falling upon\r\nit from loose strata above. All the strain possible is then put upon the\r\nrope, either by the percussion cylinder or by the winding engine; and if\r\nthe rope is an old one or rotten it breaks, leaving perhaps a long\r\nlength in the hole. The claw grapnel, shown in Fig. 199, is then\r\nattached to the rope remaining on the winding drum, and is lowered until\r\nit rests upon the slack broken rope in the bore-hole. The grapnel is\r\nmade with three claws A A centred in a cylindrical block B, which slides\r\nvertically within the casing C, the tail ends of the claws fitting into\r\ninclined slots D in the casing. During the lowering of the grapnel, the\r\nclaws are kept open, in consequence of the trigger E being held up in\r\nthe position shown in Fig. 199, by the long link F, which suspends the\r\ngrapnel from the top rope. But as soon as the grapnel rests upon the\r\nbroken rope below, the suspending link F continuing to descend allows\r\nthe trigger E to fall out of it; and then in hauling up again, the\r\ngrapnel is lifted only by the bow G of the internal block B, and the\r\nentire weight of the external casing C bears upon the inclined tail ends\r\nof the claws A, causing them to close in tight upon the broken rope and\r\nlay hold of it securely. The claws are made either hooked at the\r\nextremity or serrated. The grapnel is then hauled up sufficiently to\r\npull the broken rope tight, and wrought-iron rods 1 inch square with\r\nhooks attached at the bottom are let down to catch the bow of the\r\nboring-head, which is readily accomplished. Two powerful screw-jacks are\r\napplied to the rods at the surface, by means of the step-ladder shown in\r\nFig. 201, in which the cross-pin H is inserted at any pair of the holes,\r\nso as to suit the height of the screw-jacks.\r\n\r\nIf the boring-head does not yield quickly to these efforts, the attempt\r\nto recover it is abandoned, and it is got out of the way by being broken\r\nup into pieces. For this purpose the broken rope in the bore-hole has\r\nfirst to be removed, and it is therefore caught hold of with a sharp\r\nhook and pulled tight in the hole, while the cutting grapnel, shown in\r\nFig. 200, is slipped over it and lowered by the rods to the bottom. This\r\ntool is made with a pair of sharp cutting jaws or knives I I opening\r\nupwards, which in lowering pass down freely over the rope; but when the\r\nrods are pulled up with considerable force, the jaws nipping the rope\r\nbetween them cut it through, and it is thus removed altogether from the\r\nbore-hole. The solid wrought-iron breaking-up bar, Fig. 203, which\r\nweighs about a ton, is then lowered, and by means of the percussion\r\ncylinder it is made to pound away at the boring-head, until the latter\r\nis either driven out of the way into one side of the bore-hole, or\r\nbroken up into such fragments as that, partly by the shell-pump and\r\npartly by the grapnels, the whole obstacle is removed. The boring is\r\nthen proceeded with again, the same as before the accident.\r\n\r\nThe same mishap may occur with the shell-pump getting jammed fast in the\r\nbore-hole, as illustrated in Fig. 208; and the same means of removing\r\nthe obstacle are then adopted. Experience has shown the danger of\r\nputting any greater strain upon the rope than the percussion cylinder\r\ncan exert; and it is therefore usual to lower the grapnel rods at once,\r\nif the boring-head or pump gets fast, thus avoiding the risk of\r\nbreaking the rope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Shell-pump Jammed in the Bore-hole.\r\n\r\nFig. 208.]\r\n\r\nThe breaking of a cutter in the boring-head is not an uncommon\r\noccurrence. If, however, the bucket grapnel, or the small screw grapnel,\r\nFig. 202, be employed for its recovery, the hole is readily cleared\r\nwithout any important delay. The screw grapnel, Fig. 202, is applied by\r\nmeans of the iron grappling rods, so that by turning the rods the screw\r\nworks itself round the cutter or other similar article in the bore-hole,\r\nand securely holds it while the rods are drawn up again to the surface.\r\nThe bucket grapnel, Fig. 206, is also employed for raising clay, as well\r\nas for the purpose of bringing up cores out of the bore-hole, where\r\nthese are not raised by the boring-head itself in the manner already\r\ndescribed. The action of this grapnel is nearly similar to that of the\r\nclaw grapnel, Fig. 199; the three jaws A A, hinged to the bottom of the\r\ncylindrical casing C, and attached by connecting rods to the internal\r\nblock B sliding within the casing C, are kept open during the lowering\r\nof the tool, the trigger E being held up in the position shown in Fig.\r\n206, by the long suspending link F. On reaching the bottom, the trigger\r\nis liberated by the further descent of the link F, which, in hauling up\r\nagain, lifts only the bow G of the internal block B; so that the jaws A\r\nare made to close inwards upon the core, which is thus grasped firmly\r\nbetween them and brought up within the grapnel. Where there is clay or\r\nsimilar material at the bottom of the bore-hole, the weight of the heavy\r\nblock B in the grapnel causes the sharp edges of the pointed jaws to\r\npenetrate to some depth into the material, a quantity of which is thus\r\nenclosed within them and brought up.\r\n\r\nAnother grapnel that is also used where a bore-hole passes through a bed\r\nof very stiff clay is shown in Fig. 207, and consists of a long\r\ncast-iron cylinder H fitted with a sheet-iron mouthpiece K at the\r\nbottom, in which are hinged three conical steel jaws J J opening\r\nupwards. The weight of the tool forces it down into the clay with the\r\njaws open; and then on raising it the jaws, having a tendency to fall,\r\ncut into the clay and enclose a quantity of it inside the mouthpiece,\r\nwhich on being brought up to the surface is detached from the cylinder H\r\nand cleaned out. A second mouthpiece is put on and sent down for working\r\nin the bore-hole while the first is being emptied, the attachment of the\r\nmouthpiece to the cylinder being made by a common bayonet-joint L, so as\r\nto admit of readily connecting and disconnecting it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tubing for Bore-hole.\r\n\r\nFig. 209.]\r\n\r\nA running sand in soft clay is, however, the most serious difficulty met\r\nwith in well boring. Under such circumstances the bore-hole has to be\r\ntubed from top to bottom, which greatly increases the expense of the\r\nundertaking, not only by the cost of the tubes, but also by the time and\r\nlabour expended in inserting them. When a permanent water supply is the\r\nmain object of the boring, the additional expense of tubing the\r\nbore-hole is not of much consequence, as the tubed hole is more durable,\r\nand the surface water is thereby excluded; but in exploring for mineral\r\nit is a serious matter, as the final result of the bore-hole is then by\r\nno means certain. The mode of inserting tubes has become a question of\r\ngreat importance in connection with this system of boring, and much time\r\nand thought having been spent in perfecting the method now adopted, its\r\nvalue has been proved by the repeated success with which it has been\r\ncarried out.\r\n\r\nThe tubes used by Mather and Platt are of cast-iron, varying in\r\nthickness from 5/8 to 1 inch according to their diameter, and are all 9\r\nfeet in length. The successive lengths are connected together by means\r\nof wrought-iron covering hoops 9 inches long, made of the same outside\r\ndiameter as the tube, so as to be flush with it. These hoops are from\r\n1/4 to 3/8 inch thick, and the ends of each tube are reduced in\r\ndiameter by turning down for 4-1/2 inches from the end, to fit inside\r\nthe hoops, as shown in Fig. 209. A hoop is shrunk fast on one end of\r\neach tube, leaving 4-1/2 inches of socket projecting to receive the end\r\nof the next tube to be connected. Four or six rows of screws with\r\ncountersunk heads, placed at equal distances round the hoop, are screwed\r\nthrough into the tubes to couple the two lengths securely together. Thus\r\na flush joint is obtained both inside and outside the tubes. The lowest\r\ntube is provided at the bottom with a steel shoe, having a sharp edge\r\nfor penetrating the ground more readily.\r\n\r\nIn small borings, from 6 to 12 inches diameter, the tubes are inserted\r\ninto the bore-hole by means of screw-jacks, by the simple and\r\ninexpensive method shown in Figs. 210, 211. The boring machine\r\nfoundation A A, which is of timber, is weighted at B B by stones, pig\r\niron, or any available material; and two screw-jacks C C, each of about\r\n10 tons power, are secured with the screws downwards, underneath the\r\nbeams D D crossing the shallow well E, which is always excavated at the\r\ntop of the bore-hole. A tube F having been lowered into the mouth of the\r\nbore-hole by the winding engine, a pair of deep clamps G are screwed\r\ntightly round it, and the screw-jacks acting upon these clamps force the\r\ntube down into the ground. The boring is then resumed, and as it\r\nproceeds the jacks are occasionally worked, so as to force the tube if\r\npossible even ahead of the boring tool. The clamps are then slackened\r\nand shifted up the tubes, to suit the length of the screws of the jacks;\r\ntwo men work the jacks, and couple the lengths of tubes as they are\r\nsuccessively added. The actual boring is carried on simultaneously\r\nwithin the tubes, and is not in the least impeded by their insertion,\r\nwhich simply involves the labour of an additional man or two.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tube-forcing Apparatus with Screw-jacks.\r\n\r\nFig. 210, 211.]\r\n\r\nA more perfect and powerful tube-forcing apparatus is adopted where\r\ntubes of from 18 to 24 inches diameter have to be inserted to a great\r\ndepth, an illustration of which is afforded by an extensive piece of\r\nwork at the Horse Fort, standing in the channel at Gosport. This fort is\r\na huge round tower, as shown in Fig. 212; and to supply the garrison\r\nwith fresh water, a bore-hole is sunk into the chalk. A cast-iron well\r\nA, consisting of cylinders 6 feet diameter and 5 feet long, has been\r\nsunk 90 feet into the bed of the channel in the centre of the fort, and\r\nfrom the bottom of this well an 18-inch bore-hole B is now in progress.\r\nThe present depth is 400 feet, and the bore-hole is tubed the whole\r\ndistance with cast-iron tubes 1 inch thick, coupled as before described.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Horse Fort, Spithead._\r\n\r\n_Section shewing Bore-hole._\r\n\r\nFig. 212.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tube-forcing Apparatus with Hydraulic Presses.\r\n\r\nFig. 213.]\r\n\r\nThe method of inserting these tubes is shown in Fig. 213. Two\r\nwrought-iron columns C C, 6 inches diameter, are firmly secured in the\r\nposition shown, by castings bolted to the flanges of the cylinders A A\r\nforming the well, so that the two columns are perfectly rigid and\r\nparallel to each other. A casting D, carrying on its under side two\r\n5-inch hydraulic rams I I of 4 feet length, is formed so as to slide\r\nfreely between the columns, which act as guides; the hole in the centre\r\nof this casting is large enough to pass a bore-tube freely through it,\r\nand by means of cotters passed through the slots in the columns the\r\ncasting is securely fixed at any height. A second casting E, exactly the\r\nsame shape as the top one, is placed upon the top of the tubes B B to be\r\nforced down, a loose wrought-iron hoop being first put upon the shoulder\r\nat the top of the tube, large enough to prevent the casting E from\r\nsliding down the outside of the tubes; this casting or crosshead rests\r\nunsecured on the top of the tube and is free to move with it. The\r\nhydraulic cylinders I, with their rams pushed home, are lowered upon the\r\ncrosshead E, and the top casting D to which they are attached is then\r\nsecured firmly to the columns C by cottering through the slots. A small\r\npipe F, having a long telescope joint, connects the hydraulic cylinders\r\nI with the pumps at the surface which supply the hydraulic pressure. By\r\nthis arrangement a force of 3 tons on the square inch, or about 120 tons\r\ntotal upon the two rams, has frequently been exerted to force down the\r\ntubes at the Horse Fort. After the rams have made their full stroke of\r\nabout 3 feet 6 inches, the pressure is let off, and the hydraulic\r\ncylinders I with the top casting D slide down the rams resting on the\r\ncrosshead E, until the rams are again pushed home. The top casting D is\r\nthen fixed in its new position upon the columns C, by cottering fast as\r\nbefore, and the hydraulic pressure is again applied; and this is\r\nrepeated until the length of two tubes, making 18 feet, has been forced\r\ndown. The whole hydraulic apparatus is then drawn up again to the top,\r\nanother 18 feet of tubing added, and the operation of forcing down\r\nresumed. The tubes are steadied by guides at G and H, Fig. 213, shown\r\nalso in the plans.\r\n\r\nThe boring operations are carried on uninterruptedly during the process\r\nof tubing, excepting only for a few minutes when fresh tubes are being\r\nadded. It will be seen that the cast-iron well is in this case the\r\nultimate abutment against which the pressure is exerted in forcing the\r\ntubes down, instead of the weight of the boring machine with stones and\r\npig iron added, as in the case where the screw-jacks are used; the\r\nhydraulic method was designed specially for the work at Gosport, and has\r\nacted most perfectly. Both the cast-iron well and the bore-hole are\r\nentirely shut off from all percolation of sea-water, by first filling up\r\nthe well 30 feet with clay round the tubes, and making the tubes\r\nthemselves water-tight at the joints at the time of putting them\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nIn the event of any accident occurring to the tubes while they are being\r\nforced down the bore-hole, such as requires them to be drawn up again\r\nout of the hole, the prong grapnel, Fig. 204, is employed for the\r\npurpose, having three expanding hooked prongs, which slide down readily\r\ninside the tube, and spring open on reaching the bottom; the hooks then\r\nproject underneath the edge of the tube, which is thus raised on hauling\r\nup the grapnel. In case the tubes get disjointed and become crooked\r\nduring the process of tubing, the long straightening plug, Fig. 205,\r\nconsisting of a stout piece of timber faced with wrought-iron strips, is\r\nlowered down inside them; above this is a heavy cast-iron block, the\r\nweight of which forces the plug past the part where the tubes have got\r\ndisplaced, and thereby straightens them again.\r\n\r\nAlthough there are few localities where the geological formation is not\r\nfavourable to the yield of pure water if a boring be carried deep\r\nenough, yet it rarely happens that free-flowing wells such as those in\r\nParis and Hull are the result. Generally after the water-bearing strata\r\nhave been pierced, the level to which the water will rise is at some\r\ndepth below the surface of the ground; and only by the aid of pumps can\r\nthe desired supply be brought to the surface. Various pumping\r\narrangements have therefore been adopted to suit the different\r\nconditions that are met with.\r\n\r\nIt is not the object of the present work to treat of the forms and\r\nfittings of pumps, and the following details are only given as\r\ncompleting Mather and Platt's system.\r\n\r\nIt is always desirable to sink a cast-iron well, such as that at the\r\nHorse Fort, as nearly as possible down to the level at which the water\r\nstands in the bore-hole. The sinking of such a well is rendered an easy\r\nand rapid operation, with the aid of the boring machine in winding out\r\nthe material from the bottom, and keeping the sinkers dry by the use of\r\nthe dip-bucket, shown in Figs. 214 to 216, which will lift from 50 to\r\n100 gallons of water a minute, for taking off the surface drainage. A\r\nwell having thus been made down to the level of the water in the\r\nbore-hole, the permanent pumps are then applied to the bore-hole as\r\nfollows, the size of the pumps varying according to the diameter of the\r\nbore-hole. Taking the case of a 15-inch bore-hole, a pump barrel\r\nconsisting of a plain cast-iron cylinder, say 12 inches diameter and 12\r\nfeet long, as shown in section in Fig. 219, is attached at the bottom of\r\ncast-iron or copper pipes, which are 1/4 inch larger in diameter than\r\nthe pump barrel, and are coupled together in lengths by flanges, Fig.\r\n217. By adding the requisite number of lengths of pipe at the top, the\r\npump barrel is lowered to any desired depth down the bore-hole: the\r\nnearer to the depth of the water-bearing strata the better. The topmost\r\nlength of pipe has a broad flange at its upper end, which rests upon a\r\npreparation made to receive it on the cast-iron bottom of the well, as\r\nat C in Fig. 219.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dip Bucket.\r\n\r\nFigs. 214, 215.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sectional Plan.\r\n\r\nFig. 216.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Joint of Copper Tubes.\r\n\r\nFig. 217.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Couplings of Pump Rods.\r\n\r\nFig. 218.]\r\n\r\nA pump bucket D, Fig. 219, with a water passage through it and a clack\r\non the top side, is then lowered into the barrel, being suspended by a\r\nsolid wrought-iron pump-rod E, which is made up of lengths of 30 feet\r\ncoupled together by right-and-left-hand screw-couplings, as in Fig. 218.\r\nA second bucket F of similar form is also lowered into the pump barrel,\r\nabove the first bucket, and is suspended by hollow rods G coupled\r\ntogether in the manner just described; the inside diameter of the hollow\r\nrods G being such that the couplings of the solid rods E may pass freely\r\nthrough. The pump-rods are carried up the well A to the surface, where\r\nthe hollow rod of the top bucket is attached to the horizontal arm of a\r\nbell-crank lever H, Fig. 219; and the solid rod of the bottom bucket,\r\npassing up through the hollow rod of the top bucket, is suspended from\r\nthe horizontal arm of a second reversed bell-crank lever K, facing the\r\nfirst lever H. As the extremities of the horizontal arms of the levers\r\nmeet over the centre of the well, one of them is made with a forked end\r\nto admit of the other passing it. The vertical arms of the two levers\r\nare coupled by a connecting rod L, and a reciprocating motion is given\r\nto them by means of an oscillating steam cylinder M, the piston-rod of\r\nwhich is attached direct to the extremity of one of the vertical arms; a\r\ncrank and flywheel N are also connected to the levers, for controlling\r\nthe motion at the ends of the stroke. With the proportion shown in the\r\nFigure of 3 to 4 between the horizontal and vertical arms of the\r\nbell-crank levers, the stroke of 5 feet 4 inches of the steam piston\r\ngives 4 feet stroke of the pump. The reciprocating motion of the\r\nreversed bell-crank levers causes the two buckets to move always in\r\nopposite directions, so that they meet and separate at each stroke of\r\nthe engine. A continuous flow of water is the result, for when the top\r\nbucket is descending, the bottom bucket is rising and delivering its\r\nwater through the top bucket; and when the top bucket rises, it lifts\r\nthe water above it while the bottom bucket is descending, and water\r\nrises through the descending bottom bucket to fill the space left\r\nbetween the two buckets. In this way the effect of a double-acting pump\r\nis produced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pumping Engine and Bore-hole.\r\n\r\nFig. 219.]\r\n\r\nAlthough a continuous delivery of water is thus obtained of equal amount\r\nin each stroke, it is found in practice that a heavy shock is occasioned\r\nat each end of the stroke, in consequence of both the buckets starting\r\nand stopping simultaneously, causing the whole column of water to be\r\nstopped and put into motion again at each stroke. As an air-vessel for\r\nkeeping up the motion of the water is inapplicable in such a situation,\r\na modified arrangement of the two bell-crank levers has been adopted,\r\nwhich answers the purpose, causing each bucket at the commencement of\r\nits up stroke to take the lift off the other, before the up stroke of\r\nthe latter is completed. By this means all shock is avoided, as the\r\nfirst bucket gently and gradually relieves the second, before the return\r\nstroke of the second commences.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pumping Engine and Double-acting Pump with Improved\r\nMotion.\r\n\r\nFig. 220, 221.]\r\n\r\nIn this improved pumping motion, which is shown in Figs. 220, 221, the\r\ntwo bell-crank levers H and K, working the pump buckets, are centred one\r\nabove the other, the upper one being inverted; the vertical arms are\r\nslotted, and are both actuated by the same crank-pin working in the\r\nslots, the revolution of the crank thus giving an oscillating movement\r\nto the two levers through the extent of the arcs shown by the dotted\r\nlines in Fig. 220. The solid pump-rod E suspending the bottom bucket D\r\nis attached to the upper bell-crank lever K, and the hollow rod G of the\r\ntop bucket is suspended from the lower lever H; the crank-shaft J\r\nworking the levers is made to revolve in the direction shown by the\r\narrow in Fig. 220, by means of gearing driven by the horizontal\r\nsteam-engine P.\r\n\r\nThe result of this arrangement is, that in the revolution of the crank\r\nthe dead point of one of the levers is passed before that of the other\r\nis reached; so that the bucket which first comes to rest at the end of\r\nits stroke is started into motion again before the second bucket comes\r\nto rest. Thus in the lifting stroke of the bottom bucket worked by the\r\nupper lever K, the bucket in ascending has only reached the position\r\nshown at D in Fig. 220, at the moment when the top bucket worked by the\r\nlower lever H arrives at the bottom extremity of its stroke, and the\r\nbottom bucket D, which is still rising, continues to lift until it\r\nreaches its highest position, by which time the top bucket has got well\r\ninto motion in its up stroke, and is in its turn lifting the water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES OF WELLS EXECUTED, AND OF DISTRICTS SUPPLIED BY WELLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERMIAN STRATA.\r\n\r\n_Durham._--Large quantities of water are pumped from the lower Permian\r\nsandstone beneath the magnesian limestone of this county, and are used\r\nfor the supply of the towns of Sunderland, South Shields, Jarrow, and\r\nmany villages. The quantity, calculated by Daglish and Foster to reach\r\nfive millions of gallons a day, is obtained from an area of fifty square\r\nmiles overlying the coal measures. The water-level has not been lowered\r\nin the rock by these operations. Along the coast it is that of mean\r\ntide, and inland rises to a level of 180 feet. In the coal measures\r\nbelow there is little water, and that little is saline. Sedgwick gives\r\nthe strata as red gypseous marls, 100 feet; thin bedded grey limestone,\r\n80 feet; red gypseous marls, slightly salt, 200 feet; magnesian\r\nlimestone, 500 feet; marl slate, 60 feet; lower red sandstone, 200 feet.\r\n\r\n_Coventry._--Warwickshire. The town is supplied with 750,000 gallons of\r\nwater a day from two bore-holes made in the bottom of the reservoir. The\r\nbore-holes are respectively 6 inches and 8 inches diameter, and 200 feet\r\nand 300 feet deep. The town is situated on the Permian formation, but\r\nLatham states that the supply is procured from the red sandstone, and,\r\nfrom observations made, it has been found that the two bore-holes yield\r\nwater at the rate of 700 gallons a minute.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIAS STRATA.\r\n\r\n_Birkenhead._--There are here several deep wells belonging to the\r\nTranmere Local Board, the Birkenhead Commissioners, and the Wirral\r\nWater Company, yielding together about 4,000,000 gallons a day. Figs.\r\n222, 223, show a section and plan of the No. 2 or new engine well at the\r\nBirkenhead Waterworks. The shaft is 7 feet diameter for 105 feet, with a\r\nbore-hole 26 inches for 35 feet, 18 inches for 16 feet, 12 inches for 99\r\nfeet, and 7 inches for 150 feet, or a total depth from surface of 405\r\nfeet. The water-level is about 95 feet from surface when the engine is\r\nnot at work. At the upper water-level, shown in the 26-inch hole, the\r\nyield was at the rate of 1,807,400 gallons in twenty-four hours, at the\r\nlower level at the rate of 2,000,000 gallons in the same time. At the\r\nwater-level indicated in the 7-inch bore, water was met with in large\r\nquantities. The old engine well is almost identical.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEW ENGINE WELL, BIRKENHEAD WATERWORKS.\r\n\r\nFig. 222.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN.\r\n\r\nFig. 223.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 224.\r\n\r\nWELL AT ASPINALL'S BREWERY, BIRKENHEAD.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 225.\r\n\r\nPLAN]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Enlarged Parts.\r\n\r\n  _at_ A.

E.\r\n\r\nFig. 226.]\r\n\r\nFigs. 224, 225, are a section and plan, and Fig. 226 enlarged parts of\r\nthe well at Aspinall's brewery, Birkenhead. It consists of a shallow\r\nshaft 5 feet in diameter and steined, continued by means of iron\r\ncylinders 3 feet 3 inches in diameter and 50 feet in depth. When sand\r\nwith much water of poor quality was met with, a series of lining tubes\r\nwas introduced from the point A A, the space between these and the\r\ncylinders being filled with concrete. The tubes were discontinued at the\r\nsandstone, and the lowest portion of the hole, 3 inches in diameter, is\r\nunlined. The water overflows.\r\n\r\nFigs. 227, 228, are a section and plan of the well at Cook's brewery,\r\nBirkenhead. The shaft is 6 feet diameter, lined with 9-inch steining,\r\nand is 66 feet deep. At 29 feet from surface it is enlarged for the\r\npurpose of affording increased storage room for the water. There is a\r\n16-inch pipe at bottom of shaft 49 feet deep, continued by a 12-inch\r\nbore-hole 13 feet into the red sandstone. The water-level is 27 feet\r\nfrom the surface of the ground.\r\n\r\n_Birmingham._--Out of the 7,000,000 gallons a day supplied to the town\r\nin 1865 by the Waterworks Company, 2,000,000 were derived from wells in\r\nthe new red sandstone. In that year an Act was passed authorizing the\r\nsinking of several new wells, whereby the quantity may be greatly\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\n_Burton-on-Trent._--Fig. 229 is a section of the well at the London and\r\nColonial Brewery. Extraordinary precautions were taken in constructing\r\nthis well to obtain the water from the lower strata perfectly free from\r\nadmixture with that from above. There is a steined shaft within which is\r\nan iron cylinder, and this again is lined with brick steining backed\r\nwith concrete. The bore-hole, 182 feet deep and 4 inches diameter, is\r\nlined throughout with copper tubes. At the top the bore-hole is\r\nsurrounded with a short tube upon which a thread is cut, so that, if\r\nnecessary, a pipe may be screwed on and up to surface. The water rises\r\nto within 6 feet 3 inches of the level of the ground. Fig. 230 is an\r\nenlarged section of the arrangements at the top of the bore-hole, and\r\nFig. 231 an enlarged section of the pipe joints.\r\n\r\n_Crewe._--Cheshire. A very plentiful supply of water for the supply of\r\nthe town and works of Crewe is obtained from a well sunk in the new red\r\nsandstone. The water is said to be very pure, and from the analysis of\r\nDr. Zeidler it appears that there are only 6·10 grains of solid matter\r\nto the gallon.\r\n\r\n_Leamington._--The well in this town is situated at the foot of Newbold\r\nHill, and is 5 feet in diameter and sunk to a depth of 50 feet. At the\r\nbottom of the well a bore-hole, part of the way 18 inches and the\r\nremainder 12 inches in diameter, is carried down 200 feet. It passes\r\nthrough alternating beds of marl and sandstone, and the surface water\r\nmet with has been bricked or puddled out. The yield is about 320,000\r\ngallons in twenty-four hours. Previously to this well being made, a\r\ntrial boring, of which Figs. 232, 233, are sections, was made. This\r\nboring was lined with iron tubes 9 inches in diameter for 17 feet,\r\ninside this 8 inches in diameter for 22 feet 9 inches, and within this\r\nagain a 5-inch tube. It was continued by a 5-inch bore reduced to 4-1/2\r\ninches, and at bottom to 3 inches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WELL AT COOK'S BREWERY, BIRKENHEAD.\r\n\r\nFig. 227.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN A.B.\r\n\r\nFig. 228.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WELL AT LONDON AND COLONIAL BREWERY, BURTON-ON-TRENT.\r\n\r\nFig. 229.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Top of Bore-hole_\r\n\r\nFig. 230.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Enlarged Section of Pipe Joints_\r\n\r\nFig. 231.]\r\n\r\n_Liverpool._--The oldest wells are at Bootle, to the north of the town;\r\nthese consisted in the first instance of three lodges or excavations in\r\nthe rock, covering about 10,000 feet super and about 26-1/2 feet deep.\r\nThese were covered with timber or slate roofs, and in them 16 bore-holes\r\nwere sunk, of various diameters and at depths ranging from 13 feet to\r\n600 feet. In 1850 the yield of one of these bore-holes was 921,192\r\ngallons in twenty-four hours, and the total yield in the same time only\r\n1,102,065. The water was collected in the lodges and conveyed by a\r\ntunnel 255 feet to a well 8 feet in diameter and 50 feet deep, from\r\nwhich it was pumped. The yield of the Bootle well in 1865 was 643,678\r\ngallons a day. Since this time a new well of oval form, 12 feet by 9\r\nfeet and 108 feet deep, has been sunk, and at its completion the yield\r\nrose to 1,575,000 gallons a day, but it has again diminished\r\nconsiderably.\r\n\r\nThe Green Lane wells were commenced in 1845, the surface being 144 feet\r\nabove the sea-level and their depth 185 feet, or 41 feet below the\r\nsea-level. Headings extend in all about 300 feet from the shafts in\r\nvarious directions, three separate shafts being carried up to the\r\nsurface. At first the yield was 1,250,000 gallons a day. A bore-hole, 6\r\ninches in diameter, was then driven to a depth of 60 feet from the\r\nbottom of the well, when the yield increased to 2,317,000 gallons. In\r\nJune, 1856, the bore-hole was widened to 9 inches and carried down 101\r\nfeet farther, when the yield amounted to its present supply of over\r\n3,000,000 gallons a day.\r\n\r\nThe large quantity of water yielded by the Green Lane well is probably\r\ndue to the existence of a large fault which is considered to pass in a\r\nnorth-westerly direction by the well. In 1869 a bore-hole, 24 inches in\r\ndiameter at the top and diminishing to 18 inches in diameter, was sunk\r\nfrom the bottom of a new shaft, 174 feet deep, to a depth of 310 feet,\r\nand the additional quantity of water derived from the new hole was about\r\n800,000 gallons a day.\r\n\r\nThe Windsor Station well is of oval form, 12 feet by 10 feet and 210\r\nfeet deep, with a length of headings of 594 feet, and a bore-hole 4\r\ninches in diameter and 245 feet deep. The yield is 980,000 gallons a\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThe Dudlow Lane well is also oval, 12 feet by 9 feet, and is sunk to a\r\ndepth of 247 feet from the surface of the ground. Headings have been\r\ndriven from the bottom of the well for a total distance of 213 feet, and\r\nan 18-inch bore-hole has been sunk to a depth of 196 feet from the\r\nbottom of the well, which is chiefly in a close hard rock, with\r\noccasional white beds from which the water is mainly obtained. The yield\r\nis nearly 1,500,000 gallons a day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRIAL BORING FOR WELL AT LEAMINGTON.\r\n\r\nFigs. 232, 233.]\r\n\r\nThe total weekly supply from wells in Liverpool is upwards of 41,000,000\r\ngallons, and there are also a great number of private wells drawing\r\nwater from the sandstone, and their supply may be roughly estimated at\r\n30,000,000 gallons a week.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN OF WELLS AT LONGTON.\r\n\r\nFig. 234.]\r\n\r\n_Longton_, Staffordshire.--The Potteries obtain a portion of their\r\nsupply from a series of wells at Longton, which are shown in the\r\ndiagrammatic sectional plan, Fig. 234. The well marked No. 1 is 12 feet\r\nin diameter, and 135 feet deep in the new red sandstone. When finished\r\nthe water rose to within 35 feet from the surface. The cost of the first\r\n45 feet was 3_l._ 10_s._ a yard; of the second 45 feet, 6_l._ 10_s._ a\r\nyard; and the third 45 feet, 9_l._ a yard. When this well was 36 feet\r\ndown, a large quantity of water was met with, so a heading was driven at\r\nthat depth in the direction of No. 2 well; this, after 30 feet, passed\r\nthrough a fault which drained off the water, and the sinking of No. 1\r\nwas proceeded with. After the engine had been erected and pumping some\r\nshort time, it was proposed to drive headings from the bottom; but owing\r\nto the pumps taking up so much room in the shaft, there was not space\r\nenough for sinking operations to be carried on, and No. 2 well was\r\ntherefore sunk for convenience sake, at the cost of about 30_s._ a yard.\r\nWhen No. 2 was down 54 feet, a trial bore-hole 3 inches diameter was put\r\ndown, and water rose in a jet about 3 feet high. The well was then\r\ncontinued to the level of No. 1, and a heading, 39 feet long, driven\r\nbetween the two shafts. No. 2 has now a 12-inch bore-hole at bottom,\r\ndown 54 feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WELL AT BOLCKOW AND VAUGHAN'S, MIDDLESBOROUGH.\r\n\r\nFig. 235.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN AT A A.\r\n\r\nFig. 237.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN AT B B.\r\n\r\nFig. 238.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WELL AT BOLCKOW AND VAUGHAN'S, MIDDLESBOROUGH\r\n\r\nFig. 236.]\r\n\r\nHeadings have also been driven W. and N. of No. 2 well, at a cost of\r\n30_s._ a yard. The western heading is 213 feet long, driven with a\r\nslight rise, and gave much water. There are two headings N., running in\r\nthe direction of the railway, one over the other. The lower was driven\r\nlevel with the bottom of the shaft, but no water met with; the upper is\r\n36 feet from the surface, and is intended to carry away surplus water\r\ndown to a line of earthenware pipes which are led along the railway to a\r\nlow-level reservoir.\r\n\r\nIn the eastern heading there is a rise of 4 feet, owing to the nature of\r\nthe strata; and after it had been driven 510 feet, well No. 3 was sunk\r\nfor ventilation and for drawing out material. A bed of very hard\r\nsandstone, 63 feet long, was passed, cost 4_l._ 10_s._ a yard, and\r\nbeyond came marl, in which driving cost 45_s._ a yard. This heading was\r\ncontinued 330 feet beyond No. 3, and an air-hole 3 inches diameter put\r\ndown 126 yards deep, but no water was met with. The bed of hard\r\nsandstone was also found in driving the lower N. heading, which was\r\ndiscontinued after going into it some 5 or 6 feet. The yield from these\r\nwells is about 600,000 gallons a day, and recently a new bore-hole at\r\nNo. 3 well, when down 350 feet, gave some 380,000 gallons a day\r\nadditional.\r\n\r\n_Leek._--The Potteries waterworks have also wells at the Wallgrange\r\nSprings, near Leek; these rise from the conglomerate beds, and are\r\nstated to yield 3,000,000 gallons daily. The water from these springs is\r\npumped into Ladderidge reservoir, and is distributed from thence into\r\nthe town of Newcastle-under-Lyme and the Potteries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WELL AT ROSS, HEREFORDSHIRE.\r\n\r\nFig. 239.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN.\r\n\r\nFig. 240.]\r\n\r\n_Middlesborough._--The Figs. 235 to 238 are sections and plans of a\r\nwell at the works of Messrs. Bolckow and Vaughan, Middlesborough, made\r\nunder the direction of S. C. Homersham, C.E. A trial hole was first put\r\ndown to a depth of 398 feet 6 inches, and a shaft afterwards sunk by\r\nMessrs. Docwra and Son to that depth, through alternating beds of clay,\r\nsand, gypsum, and sandstone. At the bottom of the shaft a bore-hole of\r\n18 inches diameter throughout was made with Mather and Platt's apparatus\r\nto a depth of 1312 feet; the first 1160 feet of which were through new\r\nred sandstone interspersed with beds of clay, white sandstone, red\r\nmarl, and gypsum. Next came 40 feet of gypsum, hard white sandstone, and\r\nlimestone; and the remaining 100 feet were through red sandstone, pure\r\nsalt rock, occasional layers of limestone, and then salt rock to the\r\nbottom. The gross time spent in sinking this bore-hole was 510 days, or\r\nan average of 2 feet 5 inches a day.\r\n\r\n_Ross_, Herefordshire.--The well at the Alton Court Brewery is shown in\r\nFigs. 239, 240. The shaft, 5 feet in diameter and 27 feet deep, is\r\nsteined with 9-inch brickwork for a distance of 17 feet. At the bottom\r\nis a 12-inch bore-hole 100 feet 9 inches deep, unlined. The water is\r\nabundant. At level of the bore a heading, 6 feet high, 5 feet wide, and\r\n27 long, has been driven, to afford storage room.\r\n\r\n_Wolverhampton._--This town is partially supplied from wells sunk in the\r\nnew red sandstone. There are two shafts, 7 feet in diameter and 300 feet\r\ndeep, a heading 459 feet long, and in this a boring of 390 feet. The\r\nyield when first completed was 211,000 gallons a day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WELL AT SWANAGE, DORSET.\r\n\r\nFig. 241.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN.\r\n\r\nFig. 242.]\r\n\r\n_St. Helens_, Lancashire.--Supplied with about 570,000 gallons daily\r\nfrom two wells, each 210 feet deep, in the new red sandstone. Each well\r\nhas a bore-hole at the bottom.\r\n\r\n\r\nOOLITIC STRATA.\r\n\r\n_Northampton._--The well at the waterworks is sunk and bored 253 feet 3\r\ninches in the lias. The shaft is steined with brickwork and iron\r\ncylinders in the following order: for 16 feet 9 inches in depth the well\r\nis 7 feet 6 inches in diameter, lined with brickwork; at this depth two\r\ncast-iron cylinders 5 feet 6 inches diameter are introduced, which are\r\nagain succeeded by 9-inch brickwork, commencing at 5 feet 6 inches\r\ninternal diameter and widening out to 7 feet 6 inches in diameter. The\r\nbottom of the shaft is floored with bricks at a distance of 120 feet\r\nfrom surface. At this point the bore-hole commences, and for the first\r\n31 feet it is lined with 14-inch pipes, which rise into the shaft 5\r\nfeet above the floor. The remaining portion of the bore-hole, 102 feet,\r\nis 9 inches diameter.\r\n\r\n_Swanage_, Dorset.--The section and plan, Figs. 241, 242, are of a well\r\nat Swanage, sunk 60 feet and bored 53 feet, the lining tube rising 8\r\nfeet into the shaft, which is 5 feet 6 inches in diameter, and lined\r\nwith 9-inch steining. The strata passed through are clays and\r\nlimestones, and may perhaps be referred to the Purbeck beds. At first\r\nthis well yielded little or no water, but it now gives a sufficient\r\nsupply.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRETACEOUS STRATA.\r\n\r\n_Bishop Stortford._--The waterworks and well are situate west of the\r\ntown, near the farm buildings known as Marsh Barns.

One well is sunk near the Lewes Road, and has a total length of\r\n2400 feet of headings driven in a direction parallel with the sea, and\r\nat about the coast-level of low water. These headings intercept many\r\nfissures and materially add to the yield.\r\n\r\nA second well was sunk in 1865, at Goldstone Bottom, and headings driven\r\nto the extent of about a quarter of a mile across the valley parallel to\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nGoldstone Bottom is a naturally formed basin in the chalk, the lowest\r\nside of which, nearest the sea, is more than 60 feet higher than the\r\nmiddle or bottom of the basin. The water is obtained as at Lewes Road,\r\nfrom fissures running generally at right-angles to the coast-line, but\r\nthey are of much larger size and at far greater distances from each\r\nother; whereas at the Lewes Road well it is rare that 30 feet of\r\nheadings were driven without finding a fissure, and the yield of the\r\nlargest was not more than 100 to 150 gallons a minute. At Goldstone\r\nnearly 160 feet were traversed without any result, and then an enormous\r\nfissure was pierced which yielded at once nearly 1000 gallons a minute;\r\nand the same interval was found between this and the next fissure, which\r\nwas of a capacity nearly as large. The total length of the headings at\r\nGoldstone Bottom is 13,000 feet. The yield from each well is about\r\n3,000,000 gallons daily.\r\n\r\n_Chelmsford._--The well belonging to the Local Board of Health, situated\r\nat Moulsham, yields about 95,000 gallons of water a day. It is sunk for\r\n200 feet; the rest bored. Water overflowed at first, but now that the\r\nwell is in use and pumped from, the water only rises to 76 feet from the\r\nsurface.

There are fifteen cylinders of this size in use,\r\nand they are succeeded by others 6 feet 10 inches diameter, of which\r\nthere are six in use; these are again succeeded by two cylinders 6 feet\r\ndiameter. The whole of the cylinders are 6 feet in depth. The bottom of\r\nthe last cylinder is 118 feet from the surface, at which point they rest\r\nupon a foundation of 9-inch brick steining 7 feet in depth.

Say,\r\nin Paris, Fig. 255; 1570 feet deep of this well had been bored in 1867,\r\nsee Fig. 258.\r\n\r\nThe well at Grenelle was sunk by Mulot in 1832, and after more than\r\neight years' incessant labour, water rose on the 26th of February, 1842,\r\nfrom the total depth of 1806 feet 9 inches. The diameter of the\r\nbore-hole is 8 inches, ending, as is seen in the detail sections, Figs.\r\n259 to 262, in the lower greensand.\r\n\r\nThe well of Passy was intended to be executed in the Paris basin which\r\nit was to traverse with a diameter, hitherto unattempted, of 1 mètre\r\n(3·2809 feet); that of the Grenelle well being only 20 centimètres (8\r\ninches). It was calculated that it would reach the water-bearing stratum\r\nat nearly the same depth as the latter, and would yield 8000 mètres or\r\n10,000 cubic mètres in twenty-four hours, or about 1,786,240 gallons to\r\n2,232,800 gallons a day.\r\n\r\nFigs. 263 to 266 show a detail section of the strata passed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 255.\r\n\r\nReference.--P. Passy. G. Grenelle. B. Butte-aux-Cailles. R. Sugar\r\nRefinery.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PASSY.\r\n\r\nFig. 256.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRENELLE.\r\n\r\nFig. 257.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUGAR REFINERY.\r\n\r\nFig. 258.]\r\n\r\nThe operations were undertaken by Kind under a contract with the\r\nMunicipality of Paris, by which he bound himself to complete the works\r\nwithin the space of twelve months from the date of their commencement,\r\nand to deliver the above quantity of water for the sum of 300,000\r\nfrancs, 12,000_l_. On the 31st of May, 1857--after the workmen had been\r\nengaged nearly the time stipulated for the completion of the work, and\r\nwhen the boring had been advanced to the depth of 1732 feet from the\r\nsurface--the excavation suddenly collapsed in the upper strata, at about\r\n100 feet from the ground, and filled up the bore. Kind would have been\r\nruined had the engineers of the town held him to the strict letter of\r\nhis contract; but it was decided to behave in a liberal manner, and to\r\nrelease him from it, the town retaining his services for the completion\r\nof the well, as also the right to use his patent machinery. The\r\ndifficulties encountered in carrying the excavation through the clays of\r\nthe upper strata were found to be so serious that, under the new\r\narrangement, it required six years and nine months of continuous\r\nefforts to reach the water-bearing stratum, of which time the far larger\r\nportion was employed in traversing the clay beds. The upper part of this\r\nwell was finally lined with solid masonry, to the depth of 150 feet from\r\nthe surface; and beyond that depth tubing of wood and iron was\r\nintroduced. This tubing was continued to the depth of 1804 feet from the\r\nsurface, and had at the bottom a length of copper pipe pierced with\r\nholes to allow the water to enter. At this depth the compound tubing\r\ncould not be made to descend any lower; but the engineers employed by\r\nthe city of Paris were convinced that they could obtain the water by\r\nmeans of a preliminary boring; and therefore they proceeded to sink in\r\nthe interior of the above tube of 3.2809 feet diameter, an inner tube 2\r\nfeet 4 inches diameter, formed of wrought-iron plates 2 inches thick, so\r\nas to enable them to traverse the clays encountered at this zone. At\r\nlast, the water-bearing strata were met with on the 24th of September,\r\n1861, at the depth of 1913 feet 10 inches from the ground-line; the\r\nyield of the well being, at the first stroke of the tool that pierced\r\nthe crust, 15,000 cubic mètres in 24 hours, or 3,349,200 gallons a day;\r\nit quickly rose to 25,000 cubic mètres, or 5,582,000 gallons a day; and\r\nas long as the column of water rose without any sensible diminution, it\r\ncontinued to deliver a uniform quantity of 17,000 mètres, or 3,795,000\r\ngallons a day. The total cost of this well was more than 40,000_l._,\r\ninstead of 12,000_l._, at which Kind had originally estimated it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BORING AT GRENELLE, PARIS.\r\n\r\nFigs. 259, 260.]\r\n\r\n[BORING AT GRENELLE, PARIS--_continued_.\r\n\r\nFigs. 261. 262.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BORING AT PASSY, PARIS.\r\n\r\nFigs. 263, 264.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BORING AT PASSY, PARIS--_continued_.\r\n\r\nFigs. 265, 266.]\r\n\r\nIt may be questioned whether the engineers of the town were justified in\r\npassing the contract with Kind to finish the work within the time, and\r\nfor the sum at which he undertook it; but they certainly treated him\r\nwith kindness and consideration, in allowing him to conduct the work at\r\nthe expense of the city of Paris, for so long a period after the\r\nexpiration of his contract. It seems, however, that the French\r\nwell-borers could not at the time have attempted to continue the well\r\nupon any other system than that introduced by Kind; that is to say, upon\r\nthe supposition that it should be completed of the dimensions originally\r\nundertaken. Experience has shown that both steining and tubing were\r\nbadly executed at the well of Passy. The masonry lining was introduced\r\nafter Kind's contract had expired, and when he had ceased to have the\r\ncontrol of the works; the wrought-iron tubing at the lower part of the\r\nexcavation being a subsequent idea. It has followed from this defective\r\nsystem of tubing--the wood necessarily yielding in the vertical\r\njoints--that the water in its upward passage escaped through the\r\njoints, and went to supply the basement beds of the Paris basin, which\r\nare as much resorted to as the London sand-beds for an Artesian supply;\r\nand, in fact, the level of the water has been raised in the neighbouring\r\nwells by the quantity let in from below, and the yield of the well\r\nitself has been proportionally diminished, until it has fallen to\r\n450,000 gallons a day. That the increased yield of the neighbouring\r\nwells is to be accounted for by the escape of the water from the\r\nArtesian boring is additionally proved by the temperature of the water\r\nin them; it is found to be nearly 82° Fah., or nearly that observed in\r\nthe water of Passy. This was an unfortunate complication of the bargain\r\nmade between Kind and the Municipal Council; but it in no respect\r\naffects the choice of the boring machinery, which seems to have complied\r\nwith all the conditions it was designed to meet. The descent of the\r\ntubes and their nature ought to have been the subject of special study\r\nby the engineers of the town, who should have known the nature of the\r\nstrata to be traversed better than Kind could be supposed to do, and\r\nshould have insisted upon the tubing being executed of cast or\r\nwrought-iron, so as effectually to resist the passage of the water. At\r\nany rate, this precaution ought to have been taken in the portions of\r\nthe well carried through the basement beds of the Paris basin, or\r\nthrough the lower members of the chalk and the upper greensand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WELL AT PONDERS END.\r\n\r\nFigs. 267, 268.]\r\n\r\n_Ponders End_, Middlesex.--At the works of the London Jute Company.

characterized as being regular in shape, with plane\r\nparallel surfaces, and sharp right-angles; clear ringing sound when\r\nstruck, a compact uniform structure when broken, and freedom from\r\nair-bubbles and cracks. They should not absorb more than one-fifteenth\r\nof their weight in water.\r\n\r\nAfter making liberal allowance for waste, 9 bricks will build a square\r\nfoot 9 inches thick, or 900, 100 square feet, or say 2880 to the rood of\r\n9-inch work, which gives the simple rule of 80 bricks = a square yard of\r\n9-inch work.\r\n\r\nThe resistance to crushing is from 1200 to 4500 lb. a square inch; the\r\nresistance to fracture, from 600 to 2500 lb. a square inch; tensile\r\nstrength, 275 lb. a square inch; weight, in mortar, 175 lb. a cubic\r\nfoot; in cement, 125 lb. a cubic foot.\r\n\r\nCompressed bricks are much heavier, and consequently proportionately\r\nstronger, than those of ordinary make.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTORING WELL-WATER.\r\n\r\nThe reservoirs for storing well-water should be covered with brick\r\narches, as the water is generally found to become rapidly impure on\r\nbeing exposed to the sunlight, principally owing to the rapid growth of\r\nvegetation. Various methods have been tried, such as keeping up a\r\nconstant current of fresh water through them, and a liberal use of\r\ncaustic lime; but so rapid is the growth of the vegetation, as well as\r\nthe change in the colour of the water, that a few hours of bright\r\nsunlight may suffice to spoil several million gallons. These bad\r\nresults are completely prevented by covering the reservoirs.\r\n\r\n\r\nHINTS ON SUPERINTENDING WELL-WORK.\r\n\r\nThe engineer who has to superintend the construction of a well should be\r\never on the watch to see whether, in the course of the work, the strata\r\nbecome so modified as to overthrow conclusions previously arrived at,\r\nand on account of which the well has been undertaken.\r\n\r\nA journal of everything connected with the work should be carefully\r\nmade, and if this one point alone is attended to it will be found of\r\ngreat service both for present and future reference.\r\n\r\nBefore commencing a well a wooden box should be provided, divided by a\r\nnumber of partitions into small boxes; these serve to keep specimens of\r\nthe strata, which should be numbered consecutively and described against\r\ncorresponding numbers in the journal. At each change of character in the\r\nstrata, as well as every time the boring rods are drawn to surface, the\r\nsoil should be carefully examined, and at each change a small quantity\r\nplaced in one of the divisions of the core box, noting the depth at\r\nwhich it was obtained, with other necessary particulars. A note should\r\nbe made of all the different water-levels passed through, the height of\r\nthe well above the river near which it is situated, as well as its\r\nheight above the sea. The memoranda in the journal relating to accidents\r\nshould be especially clear and distinct in their details; it is\r\nnecessary to describe the effects of each tool used in the search for,\r\nor recovery of, broken tools in a bore-hole, in order to suit the case\r\nwith the proper appliances, for without precaution we may seek for a\r\ntool indefinitely without being sure of touching it, and perhaps\r\naggravate the evil instead of remedying it. It is by no means a bad plan\r\nto make rough notes of all immediate remarks or impressions, in such a\r\nmanner as to form a full and detailed account of any incidents which\r\noccur either in raising or lowering the tools. At the time of an\r\naccident a well kept journal is a precious resource, and at a given\r\nmoment all previous observations, trivial as they may have often\r\nseemed, will form a valuable clue to explain difficulties, without this\r\naid perfectly inexplicable.\r\n\r\nWhen an engineer has a certain latitude allowed him in the choice of the\r\nposition for a well, he should not, other things being equal, neglect\r\nthe advantages which will be derived from the proximity of a road for\r\nthe transport of his supplies; of a well, if not a brook, from which to\r\nobtain the water necessary for the cleansing of the tools; and of a\r\nneighbouring dwelling, to facilitate his active supervision. This\r\nsupervision, having often to be carried on both day and night, should be\r\nthe object of particular study; well carried out, it may be effective,\r\nwhile at the same time allowing a great amount of liberty; badly carried\r\nout, however fatiguing it may be, it will be incomplete.\r\n\r\n\r\nRATE OF PROGRESS OF BORING.\r\n\r\n(André.)\r\n\r\nThere are probably no engineering operations in which the rate of\r\nprogress is so variable as it is in that of boring. That such must\r\nnecessarily be the case will be obvious when we bear in mind that the\r\nstrata composing the earth's crust consist of very different materials;\r\nthat these materials are mingled in very different proportions, and that\r\nthey have in different parts been subjected to the action of very\r\ndifferent agencies operating with very different degrees of intensity.\r\nHence it arises not only that some kinds of rocks require a much longer\r\ntime to bore through than others, but also that the length of time may\r\nvary in rocks of the same character, and that the character may change\r\nwithin a short horizontal distance. Thus it is utterly impossible to\r\npredicate concerning the length of time which a boring in an unknown\r\ndistrict may occupy, and only a rough approximation can be arrived at in\r\nthe case of localities whose geological constitution has been generally\r\ndetermined. Such an approximation may, however, be attained to, and it\r\nis useful in estimating the probable cost; and to attain the same end,\r\nfor unknown localities, an average may be taken of the time required in\r\ndistricts of a similar geological character. The following, which are\r\ngiven for this purpose, are the averages of a great number of borings\r\nexecuted under various conditions by the ordinary methods. The progress\r\nindicated represents that made in one day of eleven hours.\r\n\r\n                                                                 ft. in.\r\n  1.

Should hard\r\nlimestone or igneous rock be met with, the rate of progress may be less\r\nthan half the above general average. Below 100 yards, not only does the\r\nrate of progress rapidly increase, but the material required diminishes\r\nin like proportion, so that for superficial borings no surface erections\r\nare needed, and the cost sinks to two or three shillings a yard.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOST OF BORING.\r\n\r\nThe cost of boring when executed by contract has already been treated of\r\nat page 80. The following formula will furnish the same results as the\r\nrule there given, but with the least possible labour of calculation;\r\n\r\n  _x_ = 0·5_d_(·187 + ·0187_d_);\r\n\r\n_x_ being the sum sought, in pounds, and _d_ the depth of the boring in\r\nyards.\r\n\r\n_Example._ Let it be required to know the cost of a bore-hole 250 yards\r\ndeep.\r\n\r\n  Here 125{·187 + (·0187 × 250)} = £607·75.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEMPERING BORING CHISELS.\r\n\r\n1. Heat the chisel to a blood red heat, and then hammer it until nearly\r\ncold; again, heat it to a blood red and quench as quickly as possible\r\nin 3 gallons of water in which is dissolved 2 oz. of oil of vitriol, 2\r\noz. of soda, and 1/2 oz. of saltpetre, or 2 oz. of sal ammoniac, 2 oz.\r\nof spirit of nitre, 1 oz. of oil of vitriol: the chisel to remain in the\r\nliquor until it is cold.\r\n\r\n2. To 3 gallons of water add 3 oz. of spirit of nitre, 3 oz. of spirits\r\nof hartshorn, 3 oz. of white vitriol, 3 oz. sal ammoniac, 3 oz. alum, 6\r\noz. of salt, with a double handful of hoof-parings, the chisel to be\r\nheated to a dark cherry red.\r\n\r\n\r\nGASES IN WELLS.\r\n\r\nThe most abundant deleterious gas met with in wells is carbonic acid,\r\nwhich extinguishes flame and is fatal to animal life. Carbonic acid is\r\nmost frequently met with in the chalk, where it has been found to exist\r\nin greater quantity in the lower than in the upper portion of the\r\nformation, and in that division to be unequally distributed. Fatal\r\neffects from it at Epsom, 200 feet down, and in Norbury Park, near\r\nDorking, 400 feet down, have been recorded. At Bexley Heath, after\r\nsinking through 140 feet of gravel and sand and 30 feet of chalk, it\r\nrushed out and extinguished the candles of the workmen. Air mixed with\r\none-tenth of this gas will extinguish lights; it is very poisonous, and\r\nwhen the atmosphere contains 8 per cent. or more there is danger of\r\nsuffocation. When present it is found most abundantly in the lower parts\r\nof a well from its great specific gravity.\r\n\r\nSulphuretted hydrogen is also occasionally met with, and is supposed to\r\nbe generated from the decomposition of water and iron pyrites.\r\n\r\nIn districts in which the chalk is covered with sand and London clay,\r\ncarburetted hydrogen is occasionally emitted, but more frequently\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen. Carburetted hydrogen seldom inflames in wells,\r\nbut in making the Thames Tunnel it sometimes issued in such abundance as\r\nto explode by the lights and scorch the workmen. Sulphuretted hydrogen\r\nalso streamed out in the same place, but in no instance with fatal\r\neffects. At Ash, near Farnham, a well was dug in sand to the depth of 36\r\nfeet, and one of the workmen descending into it was instantly\r\nsuffocated. Fatal effects have also resulted elsewhere from the\r\naccumulation of this gas in wells.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abridge, well at, 190\r\n\r\n  Accident tools, Mather and Platt's,
