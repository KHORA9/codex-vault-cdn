The study of joints, or articulations, is known as\r\nArthrology (Gr. [Greek: arthron]), and naturally begins with the\r\ndefinition of a joint. Anatomically the term is used for any connexion\r\nbetween two or more adjacent parts of the skeleton, whether they be bone\r\nor cartilage. Joints may be immovable, like those of the skull, or\r\nmovable, like the knee.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Vertical section through a synchondrosis. b, b,\r\nthe two bones; Sc, the interposed cartilage; l, the fibrous membrane\r\nwhich plays the part of a ligament.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--Vertical section through a cranial suture, b, b,\r\nthe two bones; s, opposite the suture; l, the fibrous membrane, or\r\nperiosteum, passing between the two bones, which plays the part of a\r\nligament, and which is continuous with the interposed fibrous membrane.]\r\n\r\n  Immovable joints, or _synarthroses_, are usually adaptations to growth\r\n  rather than mobility, and are always between bones. When growth ceases\r\n  the bones often unite, and the joint is then obliterated by a process\r\n  known as _synostosis_, though whether the union of the bones is the\r\n  cause or the effect of the stoppage of growth is obscure. Immovable\r\n  joints never have a cavity between the two bones; there is simply a\r\n  layer of the substance in which the bone has been laid down, and this\r\n  remains unaltered. If the bone is being deposited in cartilage a layer\r\n  of cartilage intervenes, and the joint is called _synchondrosis_ (fig.\r\n  1), but if in membrane a thin layer of fibrous tissue persists, and\r\n  the joint is then known as a _suture_ (fig. 2). Good examples of\r\n  synchondroses are the epiphysial lines which separate the epiphyses\r\n  from the shafts of developing long bones, or the occipito-sphenoid\r\n  synchondrosis in the base of the skull. Examples of sutures are\r\n  plentiful in the vault of the skull, and are given special names, such\r\n  as sutura dentata, s. serrata, s. squamosa, according to the plan of\r\n  their outline. There are two kinds of fibrous synarthroses, which\r\n  differ from sutures in that they do not synostose. One of these is a\r\n  _schindylesis_, in which a thin plate of one bone is received into a\r\n  slot in another, as in the joint between the sphenoid and vomer. The\r\n  other is a peg and socket joint, or _gomphosis_, found where the fangs\r\n  of the teeth fit into the alveoli or tooth sockets in the jaws.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 3.--Vertical section through an amphiarthrodial\r\n  joint. b, b, the two bones; c, c, the plate of cartilage on the\r\n  articular surface of each bone; Fc, the intermediate fibro-cartilage;\r\n  l, l, the external ligaments.]\r\n\r\n  Movable joints, or _diarthroses_, are divided into those in which\r\n  there is much and little movement. When there is little movement the\r\n  term half-joint or _amphiarthrosis_ is used. The simplest kind of\r\n  amphiarthrosis is that in which two bones are connected by bundles of\r\n  fibrous tissue which pass at right angles from the one to the other;\r\n  such a joint only differs from a suture in the fact that the\r\n  intervening fibrous tissue is more plentiful and is organized into\r\n  definite bundles, to which the name of _interosseous ligaments_ is\r\n  given, and also that it does not synostose when growth stops. A joint\r\n  of this kind is called a _syndesmosis_, though probably the\r\n  distinction is a very arbitrary one, and depends upon the amount of\r\n  movement which is brought about by the muscles on the two bones. As an\r\n  instance of this the inferior tibio-fibular joint of mammals may be\r\n  cited. In man this is an excellent example of a syndesmosis, and there\r\n  is only a slight play between the two bones. In the mouse there is no\r\n  movement, and the two bones form a synchondrosis between them which\r\n  speedily becomes a synostosis, while in many Marsupials there is free\r\n  mobility between the tibia and fibula, and a definite synovial cavity\r\n  is established. The other variety of amphiarthrosis or half-joint is\r\n  the _symphysis_, which differs from the syndesmosis in having both\r\n  bony surfaces lined with cartilage and between the two cartilages a\r\n  layer of fibro-cartilage, the centre of which often softens and forms\r\n  a small synovial cavity. Examples of this are the symphysis pubis, the\r\n  mesosternal joint, and the joints between the bodies of the vertebrae\r\n  (fig. 3).\r\n\r\n  The _true diarthroses_ are joints in which there is either fairly free\r\n  or very free movement. The opposing surfaces of the bones are lined\r\n  with articular cartilage, which is the unossified remnant of the\r\n  cartilaginous model in which they are formed and is called the\r\n  _cartilage of encrustment_ (fig. 4, c). Between the two cartilages is\r\n  the _joint cavity_, while surrounding the joint is the _capsule_ (fig.\r\n  4, l), which is formed chiefly by the superficial layers of the\r\n  original periosteum or perichondrium, but it may be strengthened\r\n  externally by surrounding fibrous structures, such as the tendons of\r\n  muscles, which become modified and acquire fresh attachments for the\r\n  purpose. It may be said generally that the greater the intermittent\r\n  strain on any part of the capsule the more it responds by increasing\r\n  in thickness. Lining the interior of the capsule, and all other parts\r\n  of the joint cavity except where the articular cartilage is present,\r\n  is the _synovial membrane_ (fig. 4, dotted line); this is a layer of\r\n  endothelial cells which secrete the synovial fluid to lubricate the\r\n  interior of the joint by means of a small percentage of mucin, albumin\r\n  and fatty matter which it contains.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 4.--Vertical section through a diarthrodial joint.\r\n  b, b, the two bones; c, c, the plate of cartilage on the articular\r\n  surface of each bone; l, l, the investing ligament, the dotted line\r\n  within which represents the synovial membrane. The letter s is placed\r\n  in the cavity of the joint.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 5.--Vertical section through a diarthrodial joint,\r\n  in which the cavity is subdivided into two by an interposed\r\n  fibro-cartilage or meniscus, Fc. The other letters as in fig. 4.]\r\n\r\n  A _compound diarthrodial joint_ is one in which the joint cavity is\r\n  divided partly or wholly into two by a _meniscus_ or _interarticular\r\n  fibro-cartilage_ (fig. 5, Fc).\r\n\r\n  The shape of the joint cavity varies greatly, and the different\r\n  divisions of movable joints depend upon it. It is often assumed that\r\n  the structure of a joint determines its movement, but there is\r\n  something to be said for the view that the movements to which a joint\r\n  is subject determine its shape. As an example of this it has been\r\n  found that the mobility of the metacarpo-phalangeal joint of the thumb\r\n  in a large number of working men is less than it is in a large number\r\n  of women who use needles and thread, or in a large number of medical\r\n  students who use pens and scalpels, and that the slightly movable\r\n  thumb has quite a differently shaped articular surface from the freely\r\n  movable one (see _J. Anat. and Phys._ xxix. 446). R. Fick, too, has\r\n  demonstrated that the concavity or convexity of the joint surface\r\n  depends on the position of the chief muscles which move the joint, and\r\n  has enunciated the law that when the chief muscle or muscles are\r\n  attached close to the articular end of the skeletal element that end\r\n  becomes concave, while, when they are attached far off or are not\r\n  attached at all, as in the case of the phalanges, the articular end is\r\n  convex. His mechanical explanation is ingenious and to the present\r\n  writer convincing (see _Handbuch der Gelenke_, by R. Fick, Jena,\r\n  1904). Bernays, however, pointed out that the articular ends were\r\n  moulded before the muscular tissue was differentiated (_Morph. Jahrb._\r\n  iv. 403), but to this Fick replies by pointing out that muscular\r\n  movements begin before the muscle fibres are formed, and may be seen\r\n  in the chick as early as the second day of incubation.\r\n\r\n  The freely movable joints (true diarthrosis) are classified as\r\n  follows:--\r\n\r\n  (1) _Gliding joints_ (_Arthrodia_), in which the articular surfaces\r\n  are flat, as in the carpal and tarsal bones.\r\n\r\n  (2) _Hinge joints_ (_Ginglymus_), such as the elbow and\r\n  interphalangeal joints.\r\n\r\n  (3) _Condyloid joints_ (_Condylarthrosis_), allowing flexion and\r\n  extension as well as lateral movement, but no rotation. The\r\n  metacarpo-phalangeal and wrist joints are examples of this.\r\n\r\n  (4) _Saddle-shaped joints_ (_Articulus sellaris_), allowing the same\r\n  movements as the last with greater strength. The carpo-metacarpal\r\n  joint of the thumb is an example.\r\n\r\n  (5) _Ball and socket joints_ (_Enarthrosis_), allowing free movement\r\n  in any direction, as in the shoulder and hip.\r\n\r\n  (6) _Pivot-joint_ (_Trochoides_), allowing only rotation round a\r\n  longitudinal axis, as in the radio-ulnar joints.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Embryology._\r\n\r\nJoints are developed in the mesenchyme, or that part of the mesoderm\r\nwhich is not concerned in the formation of the serous cavities. The\r\nsynarthroses may be looked upon merely as a delay in development,\r\nbecause, as the embryonic tissue of the mesenchyme passes from a fibrous\r\nto a bony state, the fibrous tissue may remain along a certain line and\r\nso form a suture, or, when chondrification has preceded ossification,\r\nthe cartilage may remain at a certain place and so form a synchondrosis.\r\nThe diarthroses represent an arrest of development at an earlier stage,\r\nfor a part of the original embryonic tissue remains as a plate of round\r\ncells, while the neighbouring two rods chondrify and ossify. This plate\r\nmay become converted into fibro-cartilage, in which case an\r\namphiarthrodial joint results, or it may become absorbed in the centre\r\nto form a joint cavity, or, if this absorption occurs in two places, two\r\njoint cavities with an intervening meniscus may result. Although,\r\nontogenetically, there is little doubt that menisci arise in the way\r\njust mentioned, the teaching of comparative anatomy suggests that,\r\nphylogenetically, they originate as an ingrowth from the capsule pushing\r\nthe synovial membrane in front of them. The subject will be returned to\r\nwhen the comparative anatomy of the individual joints is reviewed. In\r\nthe human foetus the joint cavities are all formed by the tenth week of\r\nintra-uterine life.\r\n\r\n\r\nANATOMY\r\n\r\n_Joints of the Axial Skeleton._\r\n\r\nThe bodies of the vertebrae except those of the sacrum and coccyx are\r\nseparated, and at the same time connected, by the _intervertebral\r\ndisks_. These are formed of alternating concentric rings of fibrous\r\ntissue and fibro-cartilage, with an elastic mass in the centre known as\r\nthe _nucleus pulposus_. The bodies are also bound together by _anterior_\r\nand _posterior common ligaments_. The odontoid process of the axis fits\r\ninto a pivot joint formed by the anterior arch of the atlas in front and\r\nthe _transverse ligament_ behind; it is attached to the basioccipital\r\nbone by two strong _lateral check ligaments_, and, in the mid line, by a\r\nfeebler _middle check ligament_ which is regarded morphologically as\r\ncontaining the remains of the notochord. This _atlanto-axial joint_ is\r\nthe one which allows the head to be shaken from side to side. Nodding\r\nthe head occurs at the _occipito-atlantal joint_, which consists of the\r\ntwo occipital condyles received into the cup-shaped articular facets on\r\nthe atlas and surrounded by capsular ligaments. The neural arches of the\r\nvertebrae articulate one with another by the _articular facets_, each of\r\nwhich has a capsular ligament. In addition to these the laminae are\r\nconnected by the very elastic _ligamenta subflava_. The spinous\r\nprocesses are joined by _interspinous ligaments_, and their tips by a\r\n_supraspinous ligament_, which in the neck is continued from the spine\r\nof the seventh cervical vertebra to the external occipital crest and\r\nprotuberance as the _ligamentum nuchae_, a thin, fibrous, median septum\r\nbetween the muscles of the back of the neck.\r\n\r\nThe combined effect of all these joints and ligaments is to allow the\r\nspinal column to be bent in any direction or to be rotated, though only\r\na small amount of movement occurs between any two vertebrae.\r\n\r\nThe heads of the ribs articulate with the bodies of two contiguous\r\nthoracic vertebrae and the disk between. The ligaments which connect\r\nthem are called _costo-central_, and are two in number. The anterior of\r\nthese is the _stellate ligament_, which has three bands radiating from\r\nthe head of the rib to the two vertebrae and the intervening disk. The\r\nother one is the _interarticular ligament_, which connects the ridge,\r\ndividing the two articular cavities on the head of the rib, to the disk;\r\nit is absent in the first and three lowest ribs.\r\n\r\nThe _costo-transverse ligaments_ bind the ribs to the transverse\r\nprocesses of the thoracic vertebrae. The _superior costo-transverse\r\nligament_ binds the neck of the rib to the transverse process of the\r\nvertebra above; the _middle_ or _interosseous_ connects the back of the\r\nneck to the front of its own transverse process; while the _posterior_\r\nruns from the tip of the transverse process to the outer part of the\r\ntubercle of the rib. The inner and lower part of each tubercle forms a\r\ndiarthrodial joint with the upper and fore part of its own transverse\r\nprocess, except in the eleventh and twelfth ribs. At the junction of the\r\nribs with their cartilages no diarthrodial joint is formed; the\r\nperiosteum simply becomes perichondrium and binds the two structures\r\ntogether. Where the cartilages, however, join the sternum, or where they\r\njoin one another, diarthrodial joints with synovial cavities are\r\nestablished. In the case of the second rib this is double, and in that\r\nof the first usually wanting. The _mesosternal joint_, between the pre-\r\nand mesosternum, has already been given as an example of a symphysis.\r\n\r\n  _Comparative Anatomy._--For the convexity or concavity of the\r\n  vertebral centra in different classes of vertebrates, see SKELETON:\r\n  _axial_. The intervertebral disks first appear in the Crocodilia, the\r\n  highest existing order of reptilia. In many Mammals the middle\r\n  fasciculus of the stellate ligament is continued right across the\r\n  ventral surface of the disk into the ligament of the opposite side,\r\n  and is probably serially homologous with the ventral arch of the\r\n  atlas. A similar ligament joins the heads of the ribs dorsal to the\r\n  disk. To these bands the names of anterior (ventral) and posterior\r\n  (dorsal) _conjugal ligaments_ have been given, and they may be\r\n  demonstrated in a seven months' human foetus (see B. Sutton,\r\n  _Ligaments_, London, 1902). The _ligamentum nuchae_ is a strong\r\n  elastic band in the Ungulata which supports the weight of the head. In\r\n  the Carnivora it only reaches as far forward as the spine of the axis.\r\n\r\nThe JAW JOINT, or _temporo-mandibular articulation_, occurs between the\r\nsigmoid cavity of the temporal bone and the condyle of the jaw. Between\r\nthe two there is an interarticular fibro-cartilage or meniscus, and the\r\njoint is surrounded by a capsule of which the outer part is the\r\nthickest. On first opening the mouth, the joint acts as a hinge, but\r\nvery soon the condyle begins to glide forward on to the eminentia\r\narticularis (see SKULL) and takes the meniscus with it. This gliding\r\nmovement between the meniscus and temporal bone may be separately\r\nbrought about by protruding the lower teeth in front of the upper, or,\r\non one side only, by moving the jaw across to the opposite side.\r\n\r\n  _Comparative Anatomy._--The joint between the temporal and mandibular\r\n  bones is only found in Mammals; in the lower vertebrates the jaw opens\r\n  between the quadrate and articular bones. In the Carnivora it is a\r\n  perfect hinge; in many Rodents only the antero-posterior gliding\r\n  movement is present; while in the Ruminants the lateralizing movement\r\n  is the chief one. Sometimes, as in the Ornithorhynchus, the meniscus\r\n  is absent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Joints of the Upper Extremity._\r\n\r\nThe _sterno-clavicular articulation_, between the presternum and\r\nclavicle, is a gliding joint, and allows slight upward and downward and\r\nforward and backward movements. The two bony surfaces are separated by a\r\nmeniscus, the vertical movements taking place outside and the\r\nantero-posterior inside this. There is a well-marked capsule, of which\r\nthe anterior part is strongest. The two clavicles are joined across the\r\ntop of the presternum by an _interclavicular ligament_.\r\n\r\nThe _acromio-clavicular articulation_ is also a gliding joint, but\r\nallows a swinging or pendulum movement of the scapula on the clavicle.\r\nThe upper part of the capsule is strongest, and from it hangs down a\r\npartial meniscus into the cavity.\r\n\r\n  _Comparative Anatomy._--Bland Sutton regards the interclavicular\r\n  ligament as a vestige of the interclavicle of Reptiles and Monotremes.\r\n  The menisci are only found in the Primates, but it must be borne in\r\n  mind that many Mammals have no clavicle, or a very rudimentary one. By\r\n  some the meniscus of the sterno-clavicular joint is regarded as the\r\n  homologue of the lateral part of the interclavicle, but the fact that\r\n  it only occurs in the Primates where movements in different planes are\r\n  fairly free is suggestive of a physiological rather than a\r\n  morphological origin for it.\r\n\r\nThe SHOULDER JOINT is a good example of the ball and socket or\r\nenarthrodial variety. Its most striking characteristic is mobility at\r\nthe expense of strength. The small size of the glenoid cavity in\r\ncomparison with the head of the humerus, and the great laxity of the\r\ncapsule, favour this, although the glenoid cavity is slightly deepened\r\nby a fibrous lip, called the _glenoid ligament_, round its margin. The\r\npresence of the coracoid and acromial processes of the scapula, with the\r\n_coraco-acromial ligament_ between them, serves as an overhanging\r\nprotection to the joint, while the biceps tendon runs over the head of\r\nthe humerus, inside the capsule, though surrounded by a sheath of\r\nsynovial membrane. Were it not for these two extra safeguards the\r\nshoulder would be even more liable to dislocation than it is. The upper\r\npart of the capsule, which is attached to the base of the coracoid\r\nprocess, is thickened, and known as the _coracohumeral ligament_, while\r\ninside the front of the capsule are three folds of synovial membrane,\r\ncalled _gleno-humeral folds_.\r\n\r\n  _Comparative Anatomy._--In the lower Vertebrates the shoulder is\r\n  adapted to support rather than prehension and is not so freely movable\r\n  as in the Primates. The tendon of the biceps has evidently sunk\r\n  through the capsule into the joint, and even when it is intra-capsular\r\n  there is usually a double fold connecting its sheath of synovial\r\n  membrane with that lining the capsule. In Man this has been broken\r\n  through, but remains of it persist in the _superior gleno-humeral\r\n  fold_. The _middle gleno-humeral fold_ is the vestige of a strong\r\n  ligament which steadies and limits the range of movement of the joint\r\n  in many lower Mammals.\r\n\r\nThe ELBOW JOINT is an excellent example of the ginglymus or hinge,\r\nthough its transverse axis of movement is not quite at right angles to\r\nthe central axis of the limb, but is lower internally than externally.\r\nThis tends to bring the forearm towards the body when the elbow is bent.\r\nThe elbow is a great contrast to the shoulder, as the trochlea and\r\ncapitellum of the humerus are closely adapted to the sigmoid cavity of\r\nthe ulna and head of the radius (see SKELETON: _appendicular_);\r\nconsequently movement in one plane only is allowed, and the joint is a\r\nstrong one. The capsule is divided into anterior, posterior, and two\r\nlateral ligaments, though these are all really continuous. The joint\r\ncavity communicates freely with that of the superior radio-ulnar\r\narticulation.\r\n\r\nThe _radio-ulnar joints_ are three: the upper one is an example of a\r\npivot joint, and in it the disk-shaped head of the radius rotates in a\r\ncircle formed by the lesser sigmoid cavity of the ulna internally and\r\nthe _orbicular ligament_ in the other three quarters.\r\n\r\nThe _middle radio-ulnar articulation_ is simply an interosseous\r\nmembrane, the fibres of which run downward and inward from the radius to\r\nthe ulna.\r\n\r\nThe _inferior radio-ulnar joint_ is formed by the disk-shaped lower end\r\nof the ulna fitting into the slightly concave sigmoid cavity of the\r\nradius. Below, the cavity of this joint is shut off from that of the\r\nwrist by a _triangular fibro-cartilage_. The movements allowed at these\r\nthree articulations are called pronation and supination of the radius.\r\nThe head of that bone twists, in the orbicular ligament, round its\r\ncentral vertical axis for about half a circle. Below, however, the whole\r\nlower end of the radius circles round the lower end of the ulna, the\r\ncentre of rotation being close to the styloid process of the ulna. The\r\nradius, therefore, in its pronation, describes half a cone, the base of\r\nwhich is below, and the hand follows the radius.\r\n\r\n  _Comparative Anatomy._--In pronograde Mammals the forearm is usually\r\n  permanently pronated, and the head of the radius, instead of being\r\n  circular and at the side of the upper end of the ulna, is transversely\r\n  oval and in front of that bone, occupying the same place that the\r\n  coronoid process of the ulna does in Man. This type of elbow, which is\r\n  adapted simply to support and progression, is best seen in the\r\n  Ungulata; in them both lateral ligaments are attached to the head of\r\n  the radius, and there is no orbicular ligament, since the shape of the\r\n  head of the radius does not allow of any supination. The olecranon\r\n  process of the ulna forms merely a posterior guide or guard to the\r\n  joint, but transmits no weight. No better example of the maximum\r\n  changes which the uses of support and prehension bring about can be\r\n  found than in contrasting the elbow of the Sheep or other Ungulate\r\n  with that of Man. Towards one or other of these types the elbows of\r\n  all Mammals tend. It may be roughly stated that, when pronation and\r\n  supination to the extent of a quarter of a circle are possible, an\r\n  orbicular ligament appears.\r\n\r\nThe WRIST JOINT, or _radio-carpal articulation_, lies between the radius\r\nand triangular fibro-cartilage above, and the scaphoid, semilunar, and\r\ncuneiform bones below. It is a condyloid joint allowing flexion and\r\nextension round one axis, and slight lateral movement (abduction and\r\nadduction) round the other. There is a well-marked capsule, divided into\r\nanterior, posterior, and lateral ligaments. The joint cavity is shut off\r\nfrom the inferior radio-ulnar joint above, and the intercarpal joints\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nThe _intercarpal joints_ are gliding articulations, the various bones\r\nbeing connected by palmar, dorsal, and a few interosseous ligaments, but\r\nonly those connecting the first row of bones are complete, and so\r\nisolate one joint cavity from another. That part of the intercarpal\r\njoints which lies between the first and second rows of carpal bones is\r\ncalled the _transverse carpal joint_, and at this a good deal of the\r\nmovement which seems to take place at the wrist really occurs.\r\n\r\nThe _carpo-metacarpal articulations_ are, with the exception of that of\r\nthe thumb, gliding joints, and continuous with the great intercarpal\r\njoint cavity. The carpo-metacarpal joint of the thumb is the best\r\nexample of a saddle-shaped joint in Man. It allows forward and backward\r\nand lateral movement, and is very strong.\r\n\r\nThe _metacarpo-phalangeal joints_ are condyloid joints like the wrist,\r\nand are remarkable for the great thickness of the palmar ligaments of\r\ntheir capsules. In the four inner fingers these _glenoid ligaments_, as\r\nthey are called, are joined together by the _transverse metacarpal\r\nligament_.\r\n\r\nThe _interphalangeal articulations_ are simple hinges surrounded by a\r\ncapsule, of which the dorsal part is very thin.\r\n\r\n  _Comparative Anatomy._--The wrist joint of the lower Mammals allows\r\n  less lateral movement than does that of Man, while the lower end of\r\n  the ulna is better developed and is received into a cup-shaped socket\r\n  formed by the cuneiform and pisiform bones. At the same time, unless\r\n  there is pretty free pronation and supination, the triangular\r\n  fibro-cartilage is only represented by an interosseous ligament, which\r\n  may be continuous above with the interosseous membrane between the\r\n  radius and ulna, and suggests the possibility that the fibro-cartilage\r\n  is largely a derivative of this membrane. In most Mammals the wrist is\r\n  divided into two lateral parts, as it is in the human foetus, but free\r\n  pronation and supination seem to cause the disappearance of the\r\n  septum.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Joints of the Lower Extremity._\r\n\r\nThe _sacro-innominate articulation_ consists of the _sacro-iliac joint_\r\nand the _sacro-sciatic ligaments_. The former is one of the\r\namphiarthroses or half-joints by which the sacrum is bound to the ilium.\r\nThe mechanism of the human sacrum is that of a suspension bridge slung\r\nbetween the two pillars or ilia by the very strong _posterior\r\nsacro-iliac_ ligaments which represent the chains. The axis of the joint\r\npasses through the second sacral vertebra, but the sacrum is so nearly\r\nhorizontal that the weight of the body, which is transmitted to the\r\nfirst sacral vertebra, tends to tilt that part down. This tendency is\r\ncorrected by the great and small _sacro-sciatic ligaments_, which\r\nfasten the lower part of the sacrum to the tuberosity and spine of the\r\nischium respectively, so that, although the sacrum is a suspension\r\nbridge when looked at from behind, it is a lever of the first kind when\r\nseen from the side or in sagittal section.\r\n\r\nThe _pubic symphysis_ is the union between the two pubic bones. It has\r\nall the characteristics of a symphysis, already described, and may have\r\na small median cavity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (From David Hepburn, Cunningham's _Text-book of\r\nAnatomy_.)\r\n\r\nFIG. 6.--Dissection of the Hip Joint from the front.]\r\n\r\nThe HIP JOINT, like the shoulder, is a ball and socket, but does not\r\nallow such free movement; this is due to the fact that the socket or\r\nacetabulum is deeper than the glenoid cavity and that the capsule is not\r\nso lax. At the same time the loss of mobility is made up for by\r\nincreased strength. The capsule has three thickened bands, of which the\r\nmost important is the _ilio-femoral_ or _Y-shaped ligament of Bigelow_.\r\nThe stalk of the Y is attached to the anterior inferior spine of the\r\nilium, while the two limbs are fastened to the upper and lower parts of\r\nthe spiral line of the femur. The ligament is so strong that it hardly\r\never ruptures in a dislocation of the hip. As a plumb-line, dropped from\r\nthe centre of gravity of the body, passes behind the centre of the hip\r\njoint, this ligament, lying as it does in front of the joint, takes the\r\nstrain in Man's erect position. The other two thickened parts of the\r\ncapsule are known as _pubo-femoral_ and _ischio-femoral_, from their\r\nattachments. Inside the capsule, and deepening the margin of the\r\nacetabulum, is a fibrous rim known as the _cotyloid ligament_, which\r\ngrips the spherical head of the femur and is continued across the\r\ncotyloid notch as the _transverse ligament_. The floor of the acetabulum\r\nhas a horseshoe-shaped surface of articular cartilage, concave downward,\r\nand, occupying the \"frog\" of the horse's hoof, is a mass of fat called\r\nthe _Haversian pad_. Attached to the inner margin of the horseshoe, and\r\nto the transverse ligament where that is deficient, is a reflexion of\r\nsynovial membrane which forms a covering for the pad and is continued as\r\na tube to the depression on the head of the femur called the _fossa\r\ncapitis_. This reflexion carries blood-vessels and nerves to the femur,\r\nand also contains fibrous tissue from outside the joint. It is known as\r\nthe _ligamentum teres_.\r\n\r\n  _Comparative Anatomy._--Bland Sutton regards the _ilio-femoral\r\n  ligament_ as an altered muscle, the scansorius, though against this is\r\n  the fact that, in those cases in which a scansorius is present in Man,\r\n  the ligament is as strong as usual, and indeed, if it were not there\r\n  in these cases, the erect position would be difficult to maintain. He\r\n  also looks upon the _ligamentum teres_ as the divorced tendon of the\r\n  pectineus muscle. The subject requires much more investigation, but\r\n  there is every reason to believe that it is a tendon which has sunk\r\n  into the joint, though whether that of the pectineus is doubtful,\r\n  since the intra-capsular tendon comes from the ischium in Reptiles. In\r\n  many Mammals, and among them the Orang, there is no ligamentum teres.\r\n  In others, such as the Armadillo, the structure has not sunk right\r\n  into the joint, but is connected with the pubo-femoral part of the\r\n  capsule.\r\n\r\nThe KNEE JOINT is a hinge formed by the condyles and trochlea of the\r\nfemur, the patella, and the head of the tibia. The capsule is formed in\r\nfront by the ligamentum patellae, and on each side special bands form\r\nthe lateral ligaments. On the outer side there are two of these: the\r\nanterior or _long external lateral ligament_ is a round cord running\r\nfrom the external condyle to the head of the fibula, while the posterior\r\nis slighter and passes from the same place to the styloid process of the\r\nfibula. The _internal lateral ligament_ is a flat band which runs from\r\nthe inner condyle of the femur to the internal surface of the tibia some\r\ntwo inches below the level of the knee joint. The posterior part of the\r\ncapsule is strengthened by an oblique bundle of fibres running upward\r\nand outward from the semimembranosus tendon, and called the _posterior\r\nligament of Winslow_.\r\n\r\nThe intra-articular structures are numerous and interesting. Passing\r\nfrom the head of the tibia, in front and behind the spine, are the\r\n_anterior_ and _posterior crucial ligaments_; the former is attached to\r\nthe outer side of the intercondylar notch above, and the latter to the\r\ninner side. These two ligaments cross like an X. The _semilunar\r\nfibro-cartilages_--external and internal--are partial menisci, each of\r\nwhich has an anterior and a posterior cornu by which they are attached\r\nto the head of the tibia in front and behind the spine. They are also\r\nattached round the margin of the tibial head by a _coronary ligament_,\r\nbut the external one is more movable than the internal, and this perhaps\r\naccounts for its coronary ligament being less often ruptured and the\r\ncartilage displaced than the inner one is. In addition to these the\r\nexternal cartilage has a fibrous band, called the _ligament of\r\nWrisberg_, which runs up to the femur just behind the posterior crucial\r\nligament. The external cartilage is broader, and forms more of a circle\r\nthan the internal. The synovial cavity of the knee runs up, deep to the\r\nextensor muscles of the thigh, for about two inches above the top of the\r\npatella, forming the _bursa suprapatellaris_. At the lower part of the\r\npatella it covers a pad of fat, which lies between the ligamentum\r\npatellae and the front of the head of the tibia, and is carried up as a\r\nnarrow tube to the lower margin of the trochlear surface of the femur.\r\nThis prolongation is known as the _ligamentum mucosum_, and from the\r\nsides of its base spring two lateral folds called the _ligamenta\r\nalaria_. The tendon of the popliteus muscle is an intra-capsular\r\nstructure, and is therefore covered with a synovial sheath. There are a\r\nlarge number of bursae near the knee joint, one of which, common to the\r\ninner head of the gastrocnemius and the semimembranosus, often\r\ncommunicates with the joint. The hinge movement of the knee is\r\naccompanied by a small amount of external rotation at the end of\r\nextension, and a compensatory internal rotation during flexion. This\r\nslight twist is enough to tighten up almost all the ligaments so that\r\nthey may take a share in resisting over-extension, because, in the erect\r\nposition, a vertical line from the centre of gravity of the body passes\r\nin front of the knee.\r\n\r\n  _Comparative Anatomy._--In some Mammals, e.g. Bradypus and\r\n  Ornithorhynchus, the knee is divided into three parts, two\r\n  condylo-tibial and one trochleo-patellar, by synovial folds which in\r\n  Man are represented by the ligamentum mucosum. In a typical Mammal the\r\n  external _semilunar cartilage_ is attached by its posterior horn to\r\n  the internal condyle of the femur only, and this explains the\r\n  _ligament of Wrisberg_ already mentioned. In the Monkeys and\r\n  anthropoid Apes this cartilage is circular. The _semilunar cartilages_\r\n  first appear in the Amphibia, and, according to B. Sutton, are derived\r\n  from muscles which are drawn into the joint. When only one kind of\r\n  movement (hinge) is allowed, as in the fruit bat, the cartilages are\r\n  not found. In most Mammals the superior tibio-fibular joint\r\n  communicates with the knee.\r\n\r\n  The _tibio-fibular articulations_ resemble the radio-ulnar in position\r\n  but are much less movable. The superior in Man is usually cut off i\r\n  from the knee and is a gliding joint; the middle is the interosseous\r\n  membrane, while the lower has been already used as an example of a\r\n  syndesmosis or fibrous half joint.\r\n\r\nThe ANKLE JOINT is a hinge, the astragalus being received into a lateral\r\narch formed by the lower ends of the tibia and fibula. Backward\r\ndislocation is prevented by the articular surface of the astragalus\r\nbeing broader in front than behind. The anterior and posterior parts of\r\nthe capsule are feeble, but the lateral ligaments are very strong, the\r\nexternal consisting of three separate fasciculi which bind the fibula to\r\nthe astragalus and calcaneum. To avoid confusion it is best to speak of\r\nthe movements of the ankle as dorsal and plantar flexion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (From D. Hepburn, _Cunningham's Text-book of Anatomy_.)\r\n\r\nFIG. 7.--Dissection of the Knee-joint from the front: Patella thrown\r\ndown.]\r\n\r\nThe _tarsal joints_ resemble the carpal in being gliding articulations.\r\nThere are two between the astragalus and calcaneum, and at these\r\ninversion and eversion of the foot largely occur. The inner arch of the\r\nfoot is maintained by a very important ligament called the\r\n_calcaneo-navicular_ or _spring ligament_; it connects the sustentaculum\r\ntali of the calcaneum with the navicular, and upon it the head of the\r\nastragalus rests. When it becomes stretched, flat-foot results. The\r\ntarsal bones are connected by dorsal, plantar and interosseous\r\nligaments. The _long_ and _short calcaneocuboid_ are plantar ligaments\r\nof special importance, and maintain the outer arch of the foot.\r\n\r\nThe _tarso-metatarsal_, _metatarso-phalangeal_ and _interphalangeal\r\njoints_ closely resemble those of the hand, except that the\r\ntarso-metatarsal joint of the great toe is not saddle-shaped.\r\n\r\n  _Comparative Anatomy._--The anterior fasciculus of the external\r\n  lateral ligament of the ankle is only found in Man, and is probably an\r\n  adaptation to the erect position. In animals with a long foot, such as\r\n  the Ungulates and the Kangaroo, the lateral ligaments of the ankle are\r\n  in the form of an X, to give greater protection against lateral\r\n  movement. In certain marsupials a fibro-cartilage is developed between\r\n  the external malleolus and the astragalus, and its origin from the\r\n  deeper fibres of the external lateral ligament of the ankle can be\r\n  traced. These animals have a rotatory movement of the fibula on its\r\n  long axis, in addition to the hinge movement of the ankle.\r\n\r\n  For further details of joints see R. Fick, _Handbuch der Gelenke_\r\n  (Jena, 1904); H. Morris, _Anatomy of the Joints_ (London, 1879);\r\n  Quain's, Gray's and Cunningham's _Text-books of Anatomy_; J. Bland\r\n  Sutton, _Ligaments, their Nature and Morphology_ (London, 1902); F. G.\r\n  Parsons, \"Hunterian Lectures on the Joints of Mammals,\" _Journ. Anat.\r\n  & Phys._, xxxiv. 41 and 301.     (F. G. P.)\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES AND INJURIES OF JOINTS\r\n\r\nThe affection of the joints of the human body by specific diseases is\r\ndealt with under various headings (RHEUMATISM, &c.); in the present\r\narticle the more direct forms of ailment are discussed. In most\r\njoint-diseases the trouble starts either in the synovial lining or in\r\nthe bone--rarely in the articular cartilage or ligaments. As a rule, the\r\ndisease begins after an injury. There are three principal types of\r\ninjury: (1) sprain or strain, in which the ligamentous and tendinous\r\nstructures are stretched or lacerated; (2) contusion, in which the\r\nopposing bones are driven forcibly together; (3) dislocation, in which\r\nthe articular surfaces are separated from one another.\r\n\r\n  A _sprain_ or _strain_ of a joint means that as the result of violence\r\n  the ligaments holding the bones together have been suddenly stretched\r\n  or even torn. On the inner aspect the ligaments are lined by a\r\n  synovial membrane, so when the ligaments are stretched the synovial\r\n  membrane is necessarily damaged. Small blood-vessels are also torn,\r\n  and bleeding occurs into the joint, which may become full and\r\n  distended. If, however, bleeding does not take place, the swelling is\r\n  not immediate, but synovitis having been set up, serous effusion comes\r\n  on sooner or later. There is often a good deal of heat of the\r\n  surrounding skin and of pain accompanying the synovitis. In the case\r\n  of a healthy individual the effects of a sprain may quickly pass off,\r\n  but in a rheumatic or gouty person chronic synovitis may obstinately\r\n  remain. In a person with a tuberculous history, or of tuberculous\r\n  descent, a sprain is apt to be the beginning of serious disease of the\r\n  joint, and it should, therefore, be treated with continuous rest and\r\n  prolonged supervision. In a person of health and vigour, a sprained\r\n  joint should be at once bandaged. This may be the only treatment\r\n  needed. It gives support and comfort, and the even pressure around the\r\n  joint checks effusion into it. Wide pieces of adhesive strapping,\r\n  layer on layer, form a still more useful support, and with the joint\r\n  so treated the person may be able at once to use the limb. If\r\n  strapping is not employed, the bandage may be taken off from time to\r\n  time in order that the limb and the joint may be massaged. If the\r\n  sprain is followed by much synovitis a plaster of Paris or leather\r\n  splint may be applied, complete rest being secured for the limb. Later\r\n  on, blistering or even \"firing\" may be found advisable.\r\n\r\n  _Synovitis._--When a joint has been injured, inflammation occurs in\r\n  the damaged tissue; that is inevitable. But sometimes the attack of\r\n  inflammation is so slight and transitory as to be scarcely noticeable.\r\n  This is specially likely to occur if the joint-tissues were in a state\r\n  of perfect nutrition at the time of the hurt. But if the individual or\r\n  the joint were at that time in a state of imperfect nutrition, the\r\n  effects are likely to be more serious. As a rule, it is the synovial\r\n  membrane lining the fibrous capsule of the joint which first and\r\n  chiefly suffers; the condition is termed _synovitis_. Synovitis may,\r\n  however, be due to other causes than mechanical injury, as when the\r\n  interior of the joint is attacked by the micro-organisms of pyæmia\r\n  (blood-poisoning), typhoid fever, pneumonia, rheumatism, gonorrhoea or\r\n  syphilis. Under judicious treatment the synovitis generally clears up,\r\n  but it may linger on and cause the formation of adhesions which may\r\n  temporarily stiffen the joint; or it may, especially in tuberculous,\r\n  septic or pyæmic infections, involve the cartilages, ligaments and\r\n  bones in such serious changes as to destroy the joint, and possibly\r\n  call for resection or amputation.\r\n\r\n  The symptoms of synovitis include stiffness and tenderness in the\r\n  joint. The patient notices that movements cause pain. Effusion of\r\n  fluid takes place, and there is marked fullness in the neighbourhood.\r\n  If the inflammation is advancing, the skin over the joint may be\r\n  flushed, and if the hand is placed on the skin it feels hot.\r\n  Especially is this the case if the joint is near the surface, as at\r\n  the knee, wrist or ankle.\r\n\r\n  The treatment of an inflamed joint demands rest. This may be\r\n  conveniently obtained by the use of a light wooden splint, padding and\r\n  bandages. Slight compression of the joint by a bandage is useful in\r\n  promoting absorption of the fluid. If the inflamed joint is in the\r\n  lower extremity, the patient had best remain in bed, or on the sofa;\r\n  if in the upper extremity, he should wear his arm in a sling. The\r\n  muscles acting on the joint must be kept in complete control. If the\r\n  inflammation is extremely acute a few leeches, followed by a\r\n  fomentation, will give relief; or an icebag or an evaporating lotion\r\n  may, by causing constriction of the blood-vessels, lessen the\r\n  congestion of the part and the associated pain. As the inflammation is\r\n  passing off, massage of the limb and of the joint will prove useful.\r\n  If the inflammation is long continued, the limb must still be kept at\r\n  rest. By this time it may be found that some other material for the\r\n  retentive apparatus is more convenient and comfortable, as, for\r\n  instance, undressed leather which has been moulded on wet and allowed\r\n  to dry and harden; poro-plastic felt, which has been softened by heat\r\n  and applied limp, or house-flannel which has been dipped in a creamy\r\n  mixture of plaster-of-Paris and water, and secured by a bandage.\r\n\r\n  _Chronic Disease of a Joint_ may be the tailing off of an acute\r\n  affection, and under the influence of alternate douchings of hot and\r\n  cold water, of counter-irritation by blistering or \"firing,\" and of\r\n  massage, it may eventually clear up, especially if the general health\r\n  of the individual is looked after. But if chronic disease lingers in\r\n  the joint of a child or young person, the probability of its being\r\n  under the influence of tuberculous infection must be considered. In\r\n  such a case prolonged and absolute rest is the one thing necessary. If\r\n  the disease be in the hip, knee, ankle or foot, the patient may be\r\n  fitted with an appropriate Thomas's splint and allowed to walk about,\r\n  for it is highly important to have these patients out in the fresh\r\n  air. If the disease be in the shoulder, elbow, wrist or hand, a\r\n  leather or poro-plastic splint should be moulded on, and the arm worn\r\n  in a sling. There must be no hurry; convalescence will needs be slow.\r\n  And if the child can be sent to a bracing sea-side place it will be\r\n  much in his favour.\r\n\r\n  As the disease clears up, the surface heat, the pains and the\r\n  tenderness having disappeared, and the joint having so diminished in\r\n  size as to be scarcely larger than its fellow--though the wasting of\r\n  the muscles of the limb may cause it still to appear considerably\r\n  enlarged--the splint may be gradually left off. This remission may be\r\n  for an hour or two every other day; then every other night; then every\r\n  other day, and so on, the freedom being gained little by little, and\r\n  the surgeon watching the case carefully. On the slightest indication\r\n  of return of trouble, the former restrictive measures must be again\r\n  resorted to. Massage and gentle exercises may be given day by day, but\r\n  there must be no thought of \"breaking down the stiffness.\" Many a\r\n  joint has in such circumstances been wrecked by the manipulations of a\r\n  \"bone-setter.\"\r\n\r\n  _Permanent Stiffness._--During the treatment of a case of chronic\r\n  disease of a joint, the question naturally arises as to whether the\r\n  joint will be left permanently stiff. People have the idea that if an\r\n  inflamed joint is kept long on a splint, it may eventually be found\r\n  permanently stiff. And this is quite correct. But it should be clearly\r\n  understood that it is not the _rest_ of the inflamed joint which\r\n  causes the stiffness. The matter should be put thus: in tuberculous\r\n  and other forms of chronic disease stiffness may ensue in spite of\r\n  long-continued rest. It is the destructive disease, not the enforced\r\n  rest which causes it; for inflammation of a joint rest is absolutely\r\n  necessary.\r\n\r\n  The _Causes of permanent Stiffness_ are the destructive changes\r\n  wrought by the inflammation. In one case it may be that the synovial\r\n  membrane is so far destroyed by the tuberculous or septic invasion\r\n  that its future usefulness is lost, and the joint ever afterwards\r\n  creaks at its work and easily becomes tired and painful. Thus the\r\n  joint is crippled but not destroyed. In another case the ligaments and\r\n  the cartilages are implicated as well as the synovial membrane, and\r\n  when the disease clears up, the bones are more or less locked, only a\r\n  small range of motion being left, which forcible flexion and other\r\n  methods of vigorous treatment are unable materially to improve. In\r\n  another set of cases the inflammatory germs quickly destroy the soft\r\n  tissues of the joint, and then invade the bones, and, the disease\r\n  having at last come to an end, the softened ends of the bones solidly\r\n  join together like the broken fragments in simple fracture. As a\r\n  result, osseous solidification of the joint (_synostosis_) ensues\r\n  without, of course, the possibility of any movement. And, inasmuch as\r\n  the surgeon cannot tell in any case whether the disease may not\r\n  advance in this direction, he is careful to place the limb in that\r\n  position in which it will be most useful if the bony union should\r\n  occur. Thus, the leg is kept straight, and the elbow bent.\r\n\r\n  In the course of a tuberculous or other chronic disease of a joint,\r\n  the germs of septic disease may find access to the inflamed area,\r\n  through a wound or ulceration into the joint, or by the germs being\r\n  carried thither by the blood-stream. A _joint-abscess_ results, which\r\n  has to be treated by incision and fomentations. If chronic suppuration\r\n  continues, it may become necessary to scrape out or to excise the\r\n  joint, or even to amputate the limb. And if tuberculous disease of the\r\n  joint is steadily progressing in spite of treatment, vigorous measures\r\n  may be needed to prevent the fluid from quietly ulcerating its way out\r\n  and thus inviting the entrance of septic germs. The fluid may need to\r\n  be drawn off by aspiration, and direct treatment of the diseased\r\n  synovial membrane may be undertaken by injections of chloride of zinc\r\n  or some other reagent. Or the joint may need scraping out with a sharp\r\n  spoon with the view of getting rid of the tuberculous material. Later,\r\n  excision may be deemed necessary, or in extreme cases, amputation. But\r\n  before these measures are considered, A. C. G. Bier's method of\r\n  treatment by passive congestion, and the treatment by serum\r\n  injection, will probably have been tried. If a joint is left\r\n  permanently stiff in an awkward and useless position, the limb may be\r\n  greatly improved by excision of the joint. Thus, if the knee is left\r\n  bent and the joint is excised a useful, straight limb may be obtained,\r\n  somewhat shortened, and, of course, permanently stiff. If after\r\n  disease of the hip-joint the thigh remains fixed in a faulty position,\r\n  it may be brought down straight by dividing the bone near the upper\r\n  end. A stiff shoulder or elbow may be converted into a useful, movable\r\n  joint by excision of the articular ends of the bones.\r\n\r\n  A _stiff joint_ may remain as the result of long continued\r\n  inflammation; the unused muscles are wasted and the joint in\r\n  consequence looks large. Careful measurement, however, may show that\r\n  it is not materially larger than its fellow. And though all tenderness\r\n  may have passed away, and though the neighbouring skin is no longer\r\n  hot, still the joint remains stiff and useless. No progress being made\r\n  under the influence of massage, or of gentle exercises, the surgeon\r\n  may advise that the lingering adhesion be broken down under an\r\n  anaesthetic, after which the function of the joint may quickly return.\r\n\r\n  There are the cases over which the \"bone-setter\" secures his greatest\r\n  triumphs. A qualified practitioner may have been for months\r\n  judiciously treating an inflamed joint by rest, and then feels a\r\n  hesitation with regard to suddenly flexing the stiffened limb. The\r\n  \"bone-setter,\" however, has no such qualms, and when the case passes\r\n  out of the hands of the perhaps over-careful surgeon, the unqualified\r\n  practitioner (because he, from a scientific point of view, knows\r\n  nothing) fears nothing, and, breaking down inflammatory adhesions,\r\n  sets the joint free. And his manipulations prove triumphantly\r\n  successful. But, knowing nothing and fearing nothing, he is apt to do\r\n  grievous harm in carrying out his rough treatment in other cases.\r\n  Malignant disease at the end of a bone (sarcoma), tuberculosis of a\r\n  joint, and a joint stiffened by old inflammation are to him the same\r\n  thing. \"A small bone is out of place,\" or, \"The bone is out of its\r\n  socket; it has never been put in,\" and a breaking down of everything\r\n  that resists his force is the result of the case being taken to him.\r\n  For the \"bone-setter\" has only one line of treatment. Of the\r\n  improvement which he often effects as if by magic the public are told\r\n  much. Of the cases over which the doctor has been too long devoting\r\n  skill and care, and which are set free by the \"bone-setter,\" everybody\r\n  hears--and sometimes to the discomfiture of the medical man. But of\r\n  the cases in which irreparable damage follows his vigorous\r\n  manipulation nothing is said--of his rough usage of a tuberculous hip,\r\n  or of a sarcomatous shoulder-joint, and of the inevitable disaster and\r\n  disappointment, those most concerned are least inclined to talk! A\r\n  practical surgeon with common-sense has nothing to learn from the\r\n  \"bone-setter.\"\r\n\r\n  _Rheumatoid Arthritis_, or chronic _Osteo-arthritis_, is generally\r\n  found in persons beyond middle age; but it is not rare in young\r\n  people, though with them it need not be the progressive disease which\r\n  it too often is in their elders. It is an obscure affection of the\r\n  cartilage covering the joint surfaces of the bones, and it eventually\r\n  involves the bones and the ligaments. A favourite joint for it is the\r\n  knee or hip, and when one large joint is thus affected the other\r\n  joints may escape. But when the hands or feet are implicated pretty\r\n  nearly all the small joints are apt to suffer. Whether the joint is\r\n  large or small, the cartilages wear away and new bone is developed\r\n  about the ends of the bones, so that the joint is large and\r\n  mis-shapen, the fingers being knotted and the hands deformed. When the\r\n  spine is affected it becomes bowed and stiff. This is the disease\r\n  which has crippled the old people in the workhouses and almshouses,\r\n  and with them it is steadily progressive. Its early signs are\r\n  stiffness and creaking or cracking in the joints, with discomfort and\r\n  pain after exercise, and with a little effusion into the capsule of\r\n  the joint. As regards _treatment_, medicines are of no great value.\r\n  Wet, cold and damp being bad for the patient, he should be, if\r\n  possible, got into a dry, bright, sunny place, and he should dress\r\n  warmly. Perhaps there is no better place for him in the winter than\r\n  Assuan. Cairo is not so suitable as it used to be before the dam was\r\n  made, when its climate was drier. For the spring and summer certain\r\n  British and Continental watering-places serve well. But if this luxury\r\n  cannot be afforded, the patient must make himself as happy as he can\r\n  with such hot douchings and massage as he can obtain, keeping himself\r\n  warm, and his joints covered by flannel bandages and rubbed with\r\n  stimulating liniments. In people advanced or advancing in years, the\r\n  disease, as a rule, gets slowly worse, sometimes very slowly, but\r\n  sometimes rapidly, especially when its makes its appearance in the\r\n  hip, shoulder or knee as the result of an injury. In young people,\r\n  however, its course may be cut short by attention being given to the\r\n  principles stated above.\r\n\r\n  _Charcot's Disease_ resembles osteo-arthritis in that it causes\r\n  destruction of a joint and greatly deforms it. The deformity, however,\r\n  comes on rapidly and without pain or tenderness. It is usually\r\n  associated with the symptoms of locomotor ataxy, and depends upon\r\n  disease of the nerves which preside over the nutrition of the joints.\r\n  It is incurable.\r\n\r\n  _A Loose Cartilage, or a Displaced Cartilage in the Knee Joint_ is apt\r\n  to become caught in the hinge between the thigh bone and the leg bone,\r\n  and by causing a sudden stretching of the ligaments of the joint to\r\n  give rise to intense pain. When this happens the individual is apt to\r\n  be thrown down as he walks, for it comes on with great suddenness. And\r\n  thus he feels himself to be in a condition of perpetual insecurity.\r\n  After the joint has thus gone wrong, bleeding and serous effusion take\r\n  place into it, and it becomes greatly swollen. And if the cartilage\r\n  still remains in the grip of the bones he is unable to straighten or\r\n  bend his knee. But the surgeon by suddenly flexing and twisting the\r\n  leg may manage to unhitch the cartilage and restore comfort and\r\n  usefulness to the limb. As a rule, the slipping of a cartilage first\r\n  occurs as the result of a serious fall or of a sudden and violent\r\n  action--often it happens when the man is \"dodging\" at football, the\r\n  foot being firmly fixed on the ground and the body being violently\r\n  twisted at the knee. After the slipping has occurred many times, the\r\n  amount of swelling, distress and lameness may diminish with each\r\n  subsequent slipping, and the individual may become somewhat reconciled\r\n  to his condition. As regards _treatment_, a tightly fitting steel\r\n  cage-like splint, which, gripping the thigh and leg, limits the\r\n  movements of the knee to flexion and extension, may prove useful. But\r\n  for a muscular, athletic individual the wearing of this apparatus may\r\n  prove vexatious and disappointing. The only alternative is to open the\r\n  joint and remove the loose cartilage. The cartilage may be found on\r\n  operation to be split, torn or crumpled, and lying right across\r\n  between the joint-surfaces of the bones, from which nothing but an\r\n  operation could possibly have removed it. The operation is almost sure\r\n  to give complete and permanent relief to the condition, the individual\r\n  being able to resume his old exercises and amusements without fear of\r\n  the knee playing him false. It is, however, one that should not be\r\n  undertaken without due consideration and circumspection, and the\r\n  details of the operation should be carried out with the utmost care\r\n  and cleanliness.\r\n\r\n  An accidental _wound of a joint_, as from the blade of a knife, or a\r\n  spike, entering the knee is a very serious affair, because of the risk\r\n  of septic germs entering the synovial cavity either at the time of the\r\n  injury or later. If the joint becomes thus infected there is great\r\n  swelling of the part, with redness of the skin, and with the escape of\r\n  blood-stained or purulent synovia. Absorption takes place of the\r\n  poisonous substances produced by the action of the germs, and, as a\r\n  result, great constitutional disturbance arises. Blood-poisoning may\r\n  thus threaten life, and in many cases life is saved only by\r\n  amputation. The best treatment is freely to open the joint, to wash it\r\n  out with a strong antiseptic fluid, and to make arrangement for\r\n  thorough drainage, the limb being fixed on a splint. Help may also be\r\n  obtained by increasing the patient's power of resistance to the effect\r\n  of the poisoning by injections of a serum prepared by cultivation of\r\n  the septic germs in question. If the limb is saved, there is a great\r\n  chance of the knee being permanently stiff.\r\n\r\n  _Dislocation._--The ease with which the joint-end of a bone is\r\n  dislocated varies with its form and structure, and with the position\r\n  in which it happens to be placed when the violence is applied. The\r\n  relative frequency of fracture of the bone and dislocation of the\r\n  joint depends on the strength of the bones above and below the joint\r\n  relatively to the strength of the joint itself. The strength of the\r\n  various joints in the body is dependent upon either ligament or\r\n  muscle, or upon the shape of the bones. In the hip, for instance, all\r\n  three sources of strength are present; therefore, considering the\r\n  great leverage of the long thigh bone, the hip is rarely dislocated.\r\n  The shoulder, in order to allow of extensive movement, has no osseus\r\n  or ligamentous strength; it is, therefore, frequently dislocated. The\r\n  wrist and ankle are rarely dislocated; as the result of violence at\r\n  the wrist the radius gives way, at the ankle the fibula, these bones\r\n  being relatively weaker than the respective joints. The wrist owes its\r\n  strength to ligaments, the elbow and the ankle to the shape of the\r\n  bones. The symptoms of a dislocation are distortion and limited\r\n  movement, with absence of the grating sensation felt in fracture when\r\n  the broken ends of the bone are rubbed together. The treatment\r\n  consists in reducing the dislocation, and the sooner this replacement\r\n  is effected the better--the longer the delay the more difficult it\r\n  becomes to put things right. After a variable period, depending on the\r\n  nature of the joint and the age of the person, it may be impossible to\r\n  replace the bones. The result will be a more or less useless joint.\r\n  The administration of an anaesthetic, by relaxing the muscles, greatly\r\n  assists the operation of reduction. The length of time that a joint\r\n  has to be kept quiet after it has been restored to its normal shape\r\n  depends on its form, but, as a rule, early movement is advisable. But\r\n  when by the formation of the bones a joint is weak, as at the outer\r\n  end of the collar-bone, and at the elbow-end of the radius, prolonged\r\n  rest for the joint is necessary or dislocation may recur.\r\n\r\n  _Congenital Dislocation at the Hip._--Possibly as a result of faulty\r\n  position of the subject during intra-uterine life, the head of the\r\n  thigh-bone leaves, or fails throughout to occupy, its normal situation\r\n  on the haunch-bone. The defect, which is a very serious one, is\r\n  probably not discovered until the child begins to walk, when its\r\n  peculiar rolling gait attracts attention. The want of fixation at the\r\n  joint permits of the surgeon thrusting up the thigh-bone, or drawing\r\n  it down in a painless, characteristic manner.\r\n\r\n  The first thing to be done is to find out by means of the X-rays\r\n  whether a socket exists into which, under an anaesthetic, the surgeon\r\n  may fortunately be enabled to lodge the end of the thigh-bone. If this\r\n  offers no prospect of success, there are three courses open: First,\r\n  to try under an anaesthetic to manipulate the limb until the head of\r\n  the thigh-bone rests as nearly as possible in its normal position, and\r\n  then to endeavour to fix it there by splints, weights and bandaging\r\n  until a new joint is formed; second, to cut down upon the site of the\r\n  joint, to scoop out a new socket in the haunch-bone, and thrust the\r\n  end of the thigh-bone into it, keeping it fixed there as just\r\n  described; and third, to allow the child to run about as it pleases,\r\n  merely raising the sole of the foot of the short leg by a thick boot,\r\n  so as to keep the lower part of the trunk fairly level, lest secondary\r\n  curvature of the spine ensue. The first and second methods demand many\r\n  months of careful treatment in bed. The ultimate result of the second\r\n  is so often disappointing that the surgeon now rarely advises its\r\n  adoption. But, if under an anaesthetic, as the result of skilful\r\n  manipulation the head of the thigh-bone can be made to enter a more or\r\n  less rudimentary socket, the case is worth all the time, care and\r\n  attention bestowed upon it. Sometimes the results of prolonged\r\n  treatment are so good that the child eventually is able to walk with\r\n  scarce a limp. But a vigorous attempt at placing the head of the bone\r\n  in its proper position should be made in every case.     (E. O.*)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOINTS, in engineering, may be classed either (a) according to their\r\nmaterial, as in stone or brick, wood or metal; or (b) according to their\r\nobject, to prevent leakage of air, steam or water, or to transmit force,\r\nwhich may be thrust, pull or shear; or (c) according as they are\r\nstationary or moving (\"working\" in technical language). Many joints,\r\nlike those of ship-plates and boiler-plates, have simultaneously to\r\nfulfil both objects mentioned under (b).\r\n\r\nAll stone joints of any consequence are stationary. It being\r\nuneconomical to dress the surfaces of the stones resting on each other\r\nsmoothly and so as to be accurately flat, a layer of mortar or other\r\ncementing material is laid between them. This hardens and serves to\r\ntransmit the pressure from stone to stone without its being concentrated\r\nat the \"high places.\" If the ingredients of the cement are chosen so\r\nthat when hard the cement has about the same coefficient of\r\ncompressibility as the stone or brick, the pressure will be nearly\r\nuniformly distributed. The cement also adheres to the surfaces of the\r\nstone or brick, and allows a certain amount of tension to be borne by\r\nthe joint. It likewise prevents the stones from slipping one on the\r\nother, i.e. it gives the joint very considerable shearing strength. The\r\ncomposition of the cement is chosen according as it has to \"set\" in air\r\nor water. The joints are made impervious to air or water by \"pointing\"\r\ntheir outer edges with a superior quality of cement.\r\n\r\nWood joints are also nearly all stationary. They are made partially\r\nfluid-tight by \"grooving and tenoning,\" and by \"caulking\" with oakum or\r\nsimilar material. If the wood is saturated with water, it swells, the\r\nedges of the joints press closer together, and the joints become tighter\r\nthe greater the water-pressure is which tends to produce leakage.\r\nRelatively to its weaker general strength, wood is a better material\r\nthan iron so far as regards the transmission of a thrust past a joint.\r\nSo soon as a heavy pressure comes on the joint all the small\r\nirregularities of the surfaces in contact are crushed up, and there\r\nresults an approximately uniform distribution of the pressure over the\r\nwhole area (i.e. if there be no bending forces), so that no part of the\r\nmaterial is unduly stressed. To attain this result the abutting surfaces\r\nshould be well fitted together, and the bolts binding the pieces\r\ntogether should be arranged so as to ensure that they will not interfere\r\nwith the timber surfaces coming into this close contact. Owing to its\r\nweak shearing strength on sections parallel to the fibre, timber is\r\npeculiarly unfitted for tension joints. If the pieces exerting the pull\r\nare simply bolted together with wooden or iron bolts, the joint cannot\r\nbe trusted to transmit any considerable force with safety. The stresses\r\nbecome intensely localized in the immediate neighborhood of the bolts. A\r\ntolerably strong timber tension-joint can, however, be made by making\r\nthe two pieces abut, and connecting them by means of iron plates\r\ncovering the joint and bolted to the sides of the timbers by bolts\r\npassing through the wood. These plates should have their surfaces which\r\nlie against the wood ribbed in a direction transverse to the pull. The\r\nbolts should fit their holes slackly, and should be well tightened up so\r\nas to make the ribs sink into the surface of the timber. There will then\r\nbe very little localized shearing stress brought upon the interior\r\nportions of the wood.\r\n\r\nIron and the other commonly used metals possess in variously high\r\ndegrees the qualities desirable in substances out of which joints are to\r\nbe made. The joint ends of metal pieces can easily be fashioned to any\r\nadvantageous form and size without waste of material. Also these metals\r\noffer peculiar facilities for the cutting of their surfaces at a\r\ncomparatively small cost so smoothly and evenly as to ensure the close\r\ncontact over their whole areas of surfaces placed against each other.\r\nThis is of the highest importance, especially in joints designed to\r\ntransmit force. Wrought iron and mild steel are above all other metals\r\nsuitable for tension joints where there is not continuous rapid motion.\r\nWhere such motion occurs, a layer, or, as it is technically termed, a\r\n\"bush,\" of brass is inserted underneath the iron. The joint then\r\npossesses the high strength of a wrought-iron one and at the same time\r\nthe good frictional qualities of a brass surface. Leakage past moving\r\nmetal joints can be prevented by cutting the surfaces very accurately to\r\nfit each other. Steam-engine slide-valves and their seats, and piston\r\n\"packing-rings\" and the cylinders they work to and fro in, may be cited\r\nas examples. A subsidiary compressible \"packing\" is in other situations\r\nemployed, an instance of which may be seen in the \"stuffing boxes\" which\r\nprevent the escape of steam from steam-engine cylinders through the\r\npiston-rod hole in the cylinder cover. Fixed metal joints are made fluid\r\ntight--(a) by caulking a riveted joint, i.e. by hammering in the edge of\r\nthe metal with a square-edged chisel (the tighter the joint requires to\r\nbe against leakage the closer must be the spacing of the rivets--compare\r\nthe rivet-spacing in bridge, ship and boiler-plate joints); (b) by the\r\ninsertion between the surfaces of a layer of one or other of various\r\nkinds of cement, the layer being thick or thin according to\r\ncircumstances; (c) by the insertion of a layer of soft solid substance\r\ncalled \"packing\" or \"insertion.\"\r\n\r\nApart from cemented and glued joints, most joints are formed by cutting\r\none or more holes in the ends of the pieces to be joined, and inserting\r\nin these holes a corresponding number of pins. The word \"pin\" is\r\ntechnically restricted to mean a cylindrical pin in a movable joint. The\r\nword \"bolt\" is used when the cylindrical pin is screwed up tight with a\r\nnut so as to be immovable. When the pin is not screwed, but is fastened\r\nby being beaten down on either end, it is called a \"rivet.\" The pin is\r\nsometimes rectangular in section, and tapered or parallel lengthwise.\r\n\"Gibs\" and \"cottars\" are examples of the latter. It is very rarely the\r\ncase that fixed joints have their pins subject to simple compression in\r\nthe direction of their length, though they are frequently subject to\r\nsimple tension in that direction. A good example is the joint between a\r\nsteam cylinder and its cover, where the bolts have to resist the whole\r\nthrust of the steam, and at the same time to keep the joint steam-tight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOINTS, in geology. All rocks are traversed more or less completely by\r\nvertical or highly inclined divisional planes termed _joints_. Soft\r\nrocks, indeed, such as loose sand and uncompacted clay, do not show\r\nthese planes; but even a soft loam after standing for some time,\r\nconsolidated by its own weight, will usually be found to have acquired\r\nthem. Joints vary in sharpness of definition, in the regularity of their\r\nperpendicular or horizontal course, in their lateral persistence, in\r\nnumber and in the directions of their intersections. As a rule, they are\r\nmost sharply defined in proportion to the fineness of grain of the rock.\r\nThey are often quite invisible, being merely planes of potential\r\nweakness, until revealed by the slow disintegrating effects of the\r\nweather, which induces fracture along their planes in preference to\r\nother directions in the rock; it is along the same planes that a rock\r\nbreaks most readily under the blow of a hammer. In coarse-textured\r\nrocks, on the other hand, joints are apt to show themselves as irregular\r\nrents along which the rock has been shattered, so that they present an\r\nuneven sinuous course, branching off in different directions. In many\r\nrocks they descend vertically at not very unequal distances, so that the\r\nspaces between them are marked off into so many wall-like masses. But\r\nthis symmetry often gives place to a more or less tortuous course with\r\nlateral joints in various apparently random directions, more especially\r\nwhere in stratified rocks the beds have diverse lithological characters.\r\nA single joint may be traced sometimes for many yards or even for\r\nseveral miles, more particularly when the rock is fine-grained and\r\nfairly rigid, as in limestone. Where the texture is coarse and unequal,\r\nthe joints, though abundant, run into each other in such a way that no\r\none in particular can be identified for so great a distance. The number\r\nof joints in a mass of rock varies within wide limits. Among rocks which\r\nhave undergone little disturbance the joints may be separated from each\r\nother by intervals of several yards. In other cases where the\r\nterrestrial movement appears to have been considerable, the rocks are so\r\njointed as to have acquired therefrom a fissile character that has\r\nalmost obliterated their tendency to split along the lines of bedding.\r\n\r\n  _The Cause of Jointing in Rocks._--The continual state of movement in\r\n  the crust of the earth is the primary cause of the majority of joints.\r\n  It is to the outermost layers of the lithosphere that joints are\r\n  confined; in what van Hise has described as the \"zone of fracture,\"\r\n  which he estimates may extend to a depth of 12,000 metres in the case\r\n  of rigid rocks. Below the zone of fracture, joints cannot be formed,\r\n  for there the rocks tend to flow rather than break. The rocky crust,\r\n  as it slowly accommodates itself to the shrinking interior of the\r\n  earth, is subjected unceasingly to stresses which induce jointing by\r\n  tension, compression and torsion. Thus joints are produced during the\r\n  slow cyclical movements of elevation and depression as well as by the\r\n  more vigorous movements of earthquakes. Tension-joints are the most\r\n  widely spread; they are naturally most numerous over areas of\r\n  upheaval. Compression-joints are generally associated with the more\r\n  intense movements which have involved shearing, minor-faulting and\r\n  slaty cleavage. A minor cause of tension-jointing is shrinkage, due\r\n  either to cooling or to desiccation. The most striking type of\r\n  jointing is that produced by the cooling of igneous rocks, whereby a\r\n  regularly columnar structure is developed, often called basaltic\r\n  structure, such as is found at the Giant's Causeway. This structure is\r\n  described in connexion with modern volcanic rocks, but it is met with\r\n  in igneous rocks of all ages. It is as well displayed among the\r\n  felsites of the Lower Old Red Sandstone, and the basalts of\r\n  Carboniferous Limestone age as among the Tertiary lavas of Auvergne\r\n  and Vivarais. This type of jointing may cause the rock to split up\r\n  into roughly hexagonal prisms no thicker than a lead pencil; on the\r\n  other hand, in many dolerites and diorites the prisms are much\r\n  coarser, having a diameter of 3 ft. or more, and they are more\r\n  irregular in form; they may be so long as to extend up the face of a\r\n  cliff for 300 or 400 ft. A columnar jointing has often been\r\n  superinduced upon stratified rocks by contact with intrusive igneous\r\n  masses. Sandstones, shales and coal may be observed in this condition.\r\n  The columns diverge perpendicularly from the surface of the injected\r\n  altering substance, so that when the latter is vertical, the columns\r\n  are horizontal; or when it undulates the columns follow its\r\n  curvatures. Beautiful examples of this character occur among the\r\n  coal-seams of Ayrshire. Occasionally a prismatic form of jointing may\r\n  be observed in unaltered strata; in this case it is usually among\r\n  those which have been chemically formed, as in gypsum, where, as\r\n  noticed by Jukes in the Paris Basin, some beds are divided from top to\r\n  bottom by vertical hexagonal prisms. Desiccation, as shown by the\r\n  cracks formed in mud when it dries, has probably been instrumental in\r\n  causing jointing in a limited number of cases among stratified rocks.\r\n\r\n  _Movement along Joint Planes._--In some conglomerates the joints may\r\n  be seen traversing the enclosed pebbles as well as the surrounding\r\n  matrix; large blocks of hard quartz are cut through by them as sharply\r\n  as if they had been sliced by a lapidary's machine. A similar\r\n  phenomenon may be observed in flints as they lie embedded in the\r\n  chalk, and the same joints may be traced continuously through many\r\n  yards of rock. Such facts show that the agency to which the jointing\r\n  of rocks was due must have operated with considerable force. Further\r\n  indication of movement is supplied by the rubbed and striated surfaces\r\n  of some joints. These surfaces, termed _slickensides_, have evidently\r\n  been ground against each other.\r\n\r\n  _Influence of Joints on Water-flow and Scenery._--Joints form natural\r\n  paths for the passage downward and upward of subterranean water and\r\n  have an important bearing upon water supply. Water obtained directly\r\n  from highly jointed rock is more liable to become contaminated by\r\n  surface impurities than that from a more compact rock through which it\r\n  has had to soak its way; for this reason many limestones are objected\r\n  to as sources of potable water. On exposed surfaces joints have great\r\n  influence in determining the rate and type of weathering. They furnish\r\n  an effective lodgment for surface water, which, frozen by lowering of\r\n  temperature, expands into ice and wedges off blocks of the rock; and\r\n  the more numerous the joints the more rapidly does the action proceed.\r\n  As they serve, in conjunction with bedding, to divide stratified rocks\r\n  into large quadrangular blocks, their effect on cliffs and other\r\n  exposed places is seen in the splintered and dislocated aspect so\r\n  familiar in mountain scenery. Not infrequently, by directing the\r\n  initial activity of weathering agents, joints have been responsible\r\n  for the course taken by large streams as well as for the type of\r\n  scenery on their banks. In limestones, which succumb readily to the\r\n  solvent action of water, the joints are liable to be gradually\r\n  enlarged along the course of the underground waterflow until caves are\r\n  formed of great size and intricacy.\r\n\r\n  _Infilled Joints._--Joints which have been so enlarged by solution are\r\n  sometimes filled again completely or partially by minerals brought\r\n  thither in solution by the water traversing the rock; calcite, barytes\r\n  and ores of lead and copper may be so deposited. In this way many\r\n  valuable mineral veins have been formed. Widened joints may also be\r\n  filled in by detritus from the surface, or, in deep-seated portions of\r\n  the crust, by heated igneous rock, forced from below along the planes\r\n  of least resistance. Occasionally even sedimentary rocks may be forced\r\n  up joints from below, as in the case of the so-called \"sandstone\r\n  dykes.\"\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Joints in Limestone Quarry near Mallow, co. Cork. (G.\r\n  V. Du Noyer.)]\r\n\r\n  _Practical Utility of Joints._--An important feature in the joints of\r\n  stratified rocks is the direction in which they intersect each other.\r\n  As the result of observations we learn that they possess two dominant\r\n  trends, one coincident in a general way with the direction in which\r\n  the strata are inclined to the horizon, the other running transversely\r\n  approximately at right angles. The former set is known as\r\n  _dip-joints_, because they run with the _dip_ or inclination of the\r\n  rocks, the latter is termed _strike-joints_, inasmuch as they conform\r\n  to the general _strike_ or mean outcrop. It is owing to the existence\r\n  of this double series of joints that ordinary quarrying operations can\r\n  be carried on. Large quadrangular blocks can be wedged off that would\r\n  be shattered if exposed to the risk of blasting. A quarry is usually\r\n  worked on the dip of the rock, hence strike-joints form clean-cut\r\n  faces in front of the workmen as they advance. These are known as\r\n  _backs_, and the dip-joints which traverse them as _cutters_. The way\r\n  in which this double set of joints occurs in a quarry may be seen in\r\n  the figure, where the parallel lines which traverse the shaded and\r\n  unshaded faces mark the successive strata. The broad white spaces\r\n  running along the length of the quarry behind the seated figure are\r\n  strike-joints or backs, traversed by some highly inclined lines which\r\n  mark the position of the dip-joints or cutters. The shaded ends\r\n  looking towards the spectator are cutters from which the rock has been\r\n  quarried away on one side. In crystalline (igneous) rocks, bedding is\r\n  absent and very often there is no horizontal jointing to take its\r\n  place; the joint planes break up the mass more irregularly than in\r\n  stratified rocks. Granite, for example, is usually traversed by two\r\n  sets of chief or _master-joints_ cutting each other somewhat\r\n  obliquely. Their effect is to divide the rock into long quadrangular,\r\n  rhomboidal, or even polygonal columns. But a third set may often be\r\n  noticed cutting across the columns, though less continuous and\r\n  dominant than the others. When these transverse joints are few in\r\n  number, columns many feet in length can be quarried out entire. Such\r\n  monoliths have been from early times employed in the construction of\r\n  obelisks and pillars.     (J. A. H.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOINTURE, in law, a provision for a wife after the death of her husband.\r\nAs defined by Sir E. Coke, it is \"a competent livelihood of freehold for\r\nthe wife, of lands or tenements, to take effect presently in possession\r\nor profit after the death of her husband, for the life of the wife at\r\nleast, if she herself be not the cause of determination or forfeiture of\r\nit\" (Co. Litt. 36b). A jointure is of two kinds, legal and equitable. A\r\nlegal jointure was first authorized by the Statute of Uses. Before this\r\nstatute a husband had no legal seisin in such lands as were vested in\r\nanother to his \"use,\" but merely an equitable estate. Consequently it\r\nwas usual to make settlements on marriage, the most general form being\r\nthe settlement by deed of an estate to the use of the husband and wife\r\nfor their lives in joint tenancy (or \"jointure\"), so that the whole\r\nwould go to the survivor. Although, strictly speaking, a jointure is a\r\njoint estate limited to both husband and wife, in common acceptation the\r\nword extends also to a sole estate limited to the wife only. The\r\nrequisites of a legal jointure are: (1) the jointure must take effect\r\nimmediately after the husband's death; (2) it must be for the wife's\r\nlife or for a greater estate, or be determinable by her own act; (3) it\r\nmust be made before marriage--if after, it is voidable at the wife's\r\nelection, on the death of the husband; (4) it must be expressed to be in\r\nsatisfaction of dower and not of part of it. In equity, any provision\r\nmade for a wife before marriage and accepted by her (not being an\r\ninfant) in lieu of dower was a bar to such. If the provision was made\r\nafter marriage, the wife was not barred by such provision, though\r\nexpressly stated to be in lieu of dower; she was put to her election\r\nbetween jointure and dower (see DOWER).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOINVILLE, the name of a French noble family of Champagne, which traced\r\nits descent from Étienne de Vaux, who lived at the beginning of the 11th\r\ncentury. Geoffroi III. (d. 1184), sire de Joinville, who accompanied\r\nHenry the Liberal, count of Champagne, to the Holy Land in 1147,\r\nreceived from him the office of seneschal, and this office became\r\nhereditary in the house of Joinville. In 1203 Geoffroi V., sire de\r\nJoinville, died while on a crusade, leaving no children. He was\r\nsucceeded by his brother Simon, who married Beatrice of Burgundy,\r\ndaughter of the count of Auxonne, and had as his son Jean (q.v.), the\r\nhistorian and friend of St Louis. Henri (d. 1374), sire de Joinville,\r\nthe grandson of Jean, became count of Vaudémont, through his mother,\r\nMarguerite de Vaudémont. His daughter, Marguerite de Joinville, married\r\nin 1393 Ferry of Lorraine (d. 1415), to whom she brought the lands of\r\nJoinville. In 1552, Joinville was made into a principality for the house\r\nof Lorraine. Mlle de Montpensier, the heiress of Mlle de Guise,\r\nbequeathed the principality of Joinville to Philip, duke of Orleans\r\n(1693). The castle, which overhung the Marne, was sold in 1791 to be\r\ndemolished. The title of prince de Joinville (q.v.) was given later to\r\nthe third son of King Louis Philippe. Two branches of the house of\r\nJoinville have settled in other countries: one in England, descended\r\nfrom Geoffroi de Joinville, sire de Vaucouleurs, and brother of the\r\nhistorian, who served under Henry III. and Edward I.; the other,\r\ndescended from Geoffroi de Joinville, sire de Briquenay, and son of\r\nJean, settled in the kingdom of Naples.\r\n\r\n  See J. Simonnet, _Essai sur l'histoire et la généalogie des seigneurs\r\n  de Joinville_ (1875); H. F. Delaborde, _Jean de Joinville et les\r\n  seigneurs de Joinville_ (1894).     (M. P.*)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOINVILLE, FRANÇOIS FERDINAND PHILIPPE LOUIS MARIE, PRINCE DE\r\n(1818-1900), third son of Louis Phllippe, duc d'Orléans, afterwards king\r\nof the French, was born at Neuilly on the 14th of August 1818. He was\r\neducated for the navy, and became lieutenant in 1836. His first\r\nconspicuous service was at the bombardment of San Juan de Ulloa, in\r\nNovember 1838, when he headed a landing party and took the Mexican\r\ngeneral Arista prisoner with his own hand at Vera Cruz. He was promoted\r\ncaptain, and in 1840 was entrusted with the charge of bringing the\r\nremains of Napoleon from St Helena to France. In 1844 he conducted naval\r\noperations on the coast of Morocco, bombarding Tangier and occupying\r\nMogador, and was recompensed with the grade of vice-admiral. In the\r\nfollowing year he published in the _Revue des deux mondes_ an article on\r\nthe deficiencies of the French navy which attracted considerable\r\nattention, and by his hostility to the Guizot ministry, as well as by an\r\naffectation of ill-will towards Great Britain, he gained considerable\r\npopularity. The revolution of 1848 nevertheless swept him away with the\r\nother Orleans princes. He hastened to quit Algeria, where he was then\r\nserving, and took refuge at Claremont, in Surrey, with the rest of his\r\nfamily. In 1861, upon the breaking out of the American Civil War, he\r\nproceeded to Washington, and placed the services of his son and two of\r\nhis nephews at the disposal of the United States government. Otherwise,\r\nhe was little heard of until the overthrow of the Empire in 1870, when\r\nhe re-entered France, only to be promptly expelled by the government of\r\nnational defence. Returning incognito, he joined the army of General\r\nd'Aurelle de Paladines, under the assumed name of Colonel Lutherod,\r\nfought bravely before Orleans, and afterwards, divulging his identity,\r\nformally sought permission to serve. Gambretta, however, arrested him\r\nand sent him back to England. In the National Assembly, elected in\r\nFebruary 1871, the prince was returned by two departments and elected to\r\nsit for the Haute Marne, but, by an arrangement with Thiers, did not\r\ntake his seat until the latter had been chosen president of the\r\nprovincial republic. His deafness prevented him from making any figure\r\nin the assembly, and he resigned his seat in 1876. In 1886 the\r\nprovisions of the law against pretenders to the throne deprived him of\r\nhis rank as vice-admiral, but he continued to live in France, and died\r\nin Paris on the 16th of June 1900. He had married in 1843 the princess\r\nFrancisca, sister of Pedro II., emperor of Brazil, and had a son, the\r\nduc de Penthièvre (born in 1845), also brought up to the navy, and a\r\ndaughter Françoise (1844- ) who married the duc de Chartres in 1863.\r\n\r\n  The prince de Joinville was the author of several essays and pamphlets\r\n  on naval affairs and other matters of public interest, which were\r\n  originally published for the most part either unsigned or\r\n  pseudonymously, and subsequently republished under his own name after\r\n  the fall of the Empire. They include _Essais sur la marine française_\r\n  (1853); _Études sur la marine_ (1859 and 1870); _La Guerre d'Amérique,\r\n  campagne du Potomac_ (1862 and 1872); _Encore un mot sur Sadowa_\r\n  (Brussels, 1868); and _Vieux souvenirs_ (1894).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOINVILLE, JEAN, SIRE DE (1224-1319), was the second great writer of\r\nhistory in Old French, and in a manner occupies the interval between\r\nVillehardouin and Froissart. Numerous minor chroniclers fill up the\r\ngaps, but no one of them has the idiosyncrasy which distinguishes these\r\nthree writers, who illustrate the three periods of the middle\r\nages--adolescence, complete manhood, and decadence. Joinville was the\r\nhead of a noble family of the province of Champagne (see JOINVILLE,\r\nabove). The provincial court of the counts of Champagne had long been a\r\ndistinguished one, and the action of Thibaut the poet, together with the\r\nproximity of the district to Paris, made the province less rebellious\r\nthan most of the great feudal divisions of France to the royal\r\nauthority. Joinville's first appearance at the king's court was in 1241,\r\non the occasion of the knighting of Louis IX.'s younger brother\r\nAlphonse. Seven years afterwards he took the cross, thereby giving St\r\nLouis a valuable follower, and supplying himself with the occasion of an\r\neternal memory. The crusade, in which he distinguished himself equally\r\nby wisdom and prowess, taught his practical spirit several lessons. He\r\nreturned with the king in 1254. But, though his reverence for the\r\npersonal character of his prince seems to have known no bounds, he had\r\nprobably gauged the strategic faculties of the saintly king, and he\r\ncertainly had imbibed the spirit of the dictum that a man's first duties\r\nare those to his own house. He was in the intervals of residence on his\r\nown fief a constant attendant on the court, but he declined to accompany\r\nthe king on his last and fatal expedition. In 1282 he was one of the\r\nwitnesses whose testimony was formally given at St Denis in the matter\r\nof the canonization of Louis, and in 1298 he was present at the\r\nexhumation of the saint's body. It was not till even later that he began\r\nhis literary work, the occasion being a request from Jeanne of Navarre,\r\nthe wife of Philippe le Bel and the mother of Louis le Hutin. The great\r\ninterval between his experiences and the period of the composition of\r\nhis history is important for the due comprehension of the latter. Some\r\nyears passed before the task was completed, on its own showing, in\r\nOctober 1309. Jeanne was by this time dead, and Joinville presented his\r\nbook to her son Louis the Quarreller. This original manuscript is now\r\nlost, whereby hangs a tale. Great as was his age, Joinville had not\r\nceased to be actively loyal, and in 1315 he complied with the royal\r\nsummons to bear arms against the Flemings. He was at Joinville again in\r\n1317, and on the 11th of July 1319 he died at the age of ninety-five,\r\nleaving his possessions and his position as seneschal of Champagne to\r\nhis second son Anselm. He was buried in the neighbouring church of St\r\nLaurent, where during the Revolution his bones underwent profanation.\r\nBesides his _Histoire de Saint Louis_ and his _Credo_ or \"Confession of\r\nFaith\" written much earlier, a considerable number, relatively speaking,\r\nof letters and business documents concerning the fief of Joinville and\r\nso forth are extant. These have an importance which we shall consider\r\nfurther on; but Joinville owes his place in general estimation only to\r\nhis history of his crusading experiences and of the subsequent fate of\r\nSt Louis.\r\n\r\nOf the famous French history books of the middle ages Joinville's bears\r\nthe most vivid impress of the personal characteristics of its composer.\r\nIt does not, like Villehardouin, give us a picture of the temper and\r\nhabits of a whole order or cast of men during a heroic period of human\r\nhistory; it falls far short of Froissart in vivid portraying of the\r\npicturesque and external aspects of social life; but it is a more\r\npersonal book than either. The age and circumstances of the writer must\r\nnot be forgotten in reading it. He is a very old man telling of\r\ncircumstances which occurred in his youth. He evidently thinks that the\r\ntimes have not changed for the better--what with the frequency with\r\nwhich the devil is invoked in modern France, and the sinful expenditure\r\ncommon in the matter of embroidered silk coats. But this laudation of\r\ntimes past concentrates itself almost wholly on the person of the\r\nsainted king whom, while with feudal independence he had declined to\r\nswear fealty to him, \"because I was not his man,\" he evidently regarded\r\nwith an unlimited reverence. His age, too, while garrulous to a degree,\r\nseems to have been free from the slightest taint of boasting. No one\r\nperhaps ever took less trouble to make himself out a hero than\r\nJoinville. He is constantly admitting that on such and such an occasion\r\nhe was terribly afraid; he confesses without the least shame that, when\r\none of his followers suggested defiance of the Saracens and voluntary\r\ndeath, he (Joinville) paid not the least attention to him; nor does he\r\nattempt to gloss in any way his refusal to accompany St Louis on his\r\nunlucky second crusade, or his invincible conviction that it was better\r\nto be in mortal sin than to have the leprosy, or his decided preference\r\nfor wine as little watered as might be, or any other weakness. Yet he\r\nwas a sincerely religious man, as the curious _Credo_, written at Acre\r\nand forming a kind of anticipatory appendix to the history, sufficiently\r\nshows. He presents himself as an altogether human person, brave enough\r\nin the field, and, at least when young, capable of extravagant devotion\r\nto an ideal, provided the ideal was fashionable, but having at bottom a\r\nsufficient respect for his own skin and a full consciousness of the side\r\non which his bread is buttered. Nor can he be said to be in all respects\r\nan intelligent traveller. There were in him what may be called\r\nglimmerings of deliberate literature, but they were hardly more than\r\nglimmerings. His famous description of Greek fire has a most provoking\r\nmixture of circumstantial detail with absence of verifying particulars.\r\nIt is as matter-of-fact and comparative as Dante, without a touch of\r\nDante's genius. \"The fashion of Greek fire was such that it came to us\r\nas great as a tun of verjuice, and the fiery tail of it was as big as a\r\nmighty lance; it made such noise in the coming that it seemed like the\r\nthunder from heaven, and looked like a dragon flying through the air; so\r\ngreat a light did it throw that throughout the host men saw as though it\r\nwere day for the light it threw.\" Certainly the excellent seneschal has\r\nnot stinted himself of comparisons here, yet they can hardly be said to\r\nbe luminous. That the thing made a great flame, a great noise, and\r\nstruck terror into the beholder is about the sum of it all. Every now\r\nand then indeed a striking circumstance, strikingly told, occurs in\r\nJoinville, such as the famous incident of the woman who carried in one\r\nhand a chafing dish of fire, in the other a phial of water, that she\r\nmight burn heaven and quench hell, lest in future any man should serve\r\nGod merely for hope of the one or fear of the other. But in these cases\r\nthe author only repeats what he has heard from others. On his own\r\naccount he is much more interested in small personal details than in\r\ngreater things. How the Saracens, when they took him prisoner, he being\r\nhalf dead with a complication of diseases, kindly left him \"un mien\r\ncouverture d'écarlate\" which his mother had given him, and which he put\r\nover him, having made a hole therein and bound it round him with a cord;\r\nhow when he came to Acre in a pitiable condition an old servant of his\r\nhouse presented himself, and \"brought me clean white hoods and combed my\r\nhair most comfortably\", how he bought a hundred tuns of wine and served\r\nit--the best first, according to high authority--well-watered to his\r\nprivate soldiers, somewhat less watered to the squires, and to the\r\nknights neat, but with a suggestive phial of the weaker liquid to mix\r\n\"si comme ils vouloient\"--these are the details in which he seems to\r\ntake greatest pleasure, and for readers six hundred years after date\r\nperhaps they are not the least interesting details.\r\n\r\nIt would, however, be a mistake to imagine that Joinville's book is\r\nexclusively or even mainly a chronicle of small beer. If he is not a\r\nVillehardouin or a Carlyle, his battlepieces are vivid and truthful, and\r\nhe has occasional passages of no small episodic importance, such as that\r\ndealing with the Old Man of the Mountain. But, above all, the central\r\nfigure of his book redeems it from the possibility of the charge of\r\nbeing commonplace or ignoble. To St Louis Joinville is a nobler Boswell;\r\nand hero-worshipper, hero, and heroic ideal all have something of the\r\nsublime about them. The very pettiness of the details in which the good\r\nseneschal indulges as to his own weakness only serves to enhance the\r\nsublime unworldliness of the king. Joinville is a better warrior than\r\nLouis, but, while the former frankly prays for his own safety, the\r\nlatter only thinks of his army's when they have escaped from the hands\r\nof the aliens. One of the king's knights boasts that ten thousand pieces\r\nhave been \"forcontés\" (counted short) to the Saracens; and it is with\r\nthe utmost trouble that Joinville and the rest can persuade the king\r\nthat this is a joke, and that the Saracens are much more likely to have\r\ngot the advantage. He warns Joinville against wine-bibbing, against bad\r\nlanguage, against all manner of foibles small and great; and the pupil\r\nacknowledges that this physician at any rate had healed himself in these\r\nrespects. It is true that he is severe towards infidels; and his\r\napproval of the knight who, finding a Jew likely to get the better of a\r\ntheological argument, resorted to the baculine variety of logic, does\r\nnot meet the views of the 20th century. But Louis was not of the 20th\r\ncentury but of the 13th, and after his kind he certainly deserved\r\nJoinville's admiration. Side by side with his indignation at the idea of\r\ncheating his Saracen enemies may be mentioned his answer to those who\r\nafter Taillebourg complained that he had let off Henry III. too easily.\r\n\"He is my man now, and he was not before,\" said the king, a most\r\nunpractical person certainly, and in some ways a sore saint for France.\r\nBut it is easy to understand the half-despairing adoration with which a\r\nshrewd and somewhat prosaic person like Joinville must have regarded\r\nthis flower of chivalry born out of due time. He has had his reward, for\r\nassuredly the portrait of St Louis, from the early collection of\r\nanecdotes to the last hearsay sketch of the woeful end at Tunis, with\r\nthe famous _enseignement_ which is still the best summary of the\r\ntheoretical duties of a Christian king in medieval times, is such as to\r\ntake away all charge of vulgarity or mere _commérage_ from Joinville, a\r\ncharge to which otherwise he might perhaps have been exposed.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of the book is, considering its circumstances and the\r\ndate of its composition, sufficiently methodical. According to its own\r\naccount it is divided into three parts--the first dealing generally with\r\nthe character and conduct of the hero; the second with his acts and\r\ndeeds in Egypt, Palestine, &c., as Joinville knew them; the third with\r\nhis subsequent life and death. Of these the last is very brief, the\r\nfirst not long; the middle constitutes the bulk of the work. The\r\ncontents of the first part are, as might be expected, miscellaneous\r\nenough, and consist chiefly of stories chosen to show the valour of\r\nLouis, his piety, his justice, his personal temperance, and so forth.\r\nThe second part enters upon the history of the crusade itself, and tells\r\nhow Joinville pledged all his land save so much as would bring in a\r\nthousand livres a year, and started with a brave retinue of nine knights\r\n(two of whom besides himself wore bannerets), and shared a ship with the\r\nsire d'Aspremont, leaving Joinville without raising his eyes, \"pour ce\r\nque le cuer ne me attendrisist du biau chastel que je lessoie et de mes\r\ndeux enfans\"; how they could not get out of sight of a high mountainous\r\nisland (Lampedusa or Pantellaria) till they had made a procession round\r\nthe masts in honour of the Virgin; how they reached first Cyprus and\r\nthen Egypt; how they took Damietta, and then entangled themselves in the\r\nDelta. Bad generalship, which is sufficiently obvious, unwholesome\r\nfood--it was Lent, and they ate the Nile fish which had been feasting on\r\nthe carcases of the slain--and Greek fire did the rest, and personal\r\nvalour was of little avail, not merely against superior numbers and\r\nbetter generals, but against dysentery and a certain \"mal de l'ost\"\r\nwhich attacked the mouth and the legs, a curious human version of a\r\nwell-known bestial malady. After ransom Acre was the chief scene of\r\nLouis's stay in the East, and here Joinville lived in some state, and\r\nsaw not a few interesting things, hearing besides much gossip as to the\r\ninferior affairs of Asia from ambassadors, merchants and others. At last\r\nthey journeyed back again to France, not without considerable\r\nexperiences of the perils of the deep, which Joinville tells with a good\r\ndeal of spirit. The remainder of the book is very brief. Some anecdotes\r\nof the king's \"justice,\" his favourite and distinguishing attribute\r\nduring the sixteen years which intervened between the two crusades, are\r\ngiven; then comes the story of Joinville's own refusal to join the\r\nsecond expedition, a refusal which bluntly alleged the harm done by the\r\nking's men who stayed at home to the vassals of those who went abroad as\r\nthe reason of Joinville's resolution to remain behind. The death of the\r\nking at Tunis, his _enseignement_ to his son, and the story of his\r\ncanonization complete the work.\r\n\r\n  The book in which this interesting story is told has had a literary\r\n  history which less affects its matter than the vicissitudes to which\r\n  Froissart has been subjected, but which is hardly less curious in its\r\n  way. There is no reason for supposing that Joinville indulged in\r\n  various editions, such as those which have given Kervyn de Lettenhove\r\n  and Siméon Luce so much trouble, and which make so vast a difference\r\n  between the first and the last redaction of the chronicler of the\r\n  Hundred Years' War. Indeed the great age of the seneschal of\r\n  Champagne, and his intimate first-hand acquaintance with his subject,\r\n  made such variations extremely improbable. But, whereas there is no\r\n  great difficulty (though much labour) in ascertaining the original and\r\n  all subsequent texts of Froissart, the original text of Joinville was\r\n  until recently unknown, and even now may be said to be in the state of\r\n  a conjectural restoration. It has been said that the book was\r\n  presented to Louis le Hutin. Now we have a catalogue of Louis le\r\n  Hutin's library, and, strange to say, Joinville does not figure in it.\r\n  His book seems to have undergone very much the same fate as that which\r\n  befell the originals of the first two volumes of the _Paston Letters_\r\n  which Sir John Fenn presented to George the Third. Several royal\r\n  library catalogues of the 14th century are known, but in none of these\r\n  does the _Histoire de St Louis_ appear. It does appear in that of\r\n  Charles V. (1411), but apparently no copy even of this survives. As\r\n  everybody knows, however, books could be and were multiplied by the\r\n  process of copying tolerably freely, and a copy at first or second\r\n  hand which belonged to the fiddler king René of Provence in the 15th\r\n  century was used for the first printed edition in 1547. Other editions\r\n  were printed from other versions, all evidently posterior to the\r\n  original. But in 1741 the well-known medievalist La Curne de St Palaye\r\n  found at Lucca a manuscript of the 16th century, evidently\r\n  representing an older text than any yet printed. Three years later a\r\n  14th-century copy was found at Brussels, and this is the standard\r\n  manuscript authority for the text of Joinville. Those who prefer to\r\n  rest on MS. authority will probably hold to this text, which appears\r\n  in the well-known collection of Michaud and Poujoulat as well as that\r\n  of Buchon, and in a careful and useful separate edition by Francisque\r\n  Michel. The modern science of critical editing, however, which applies\r\n  to medieval texts the principles long recognized in editing the\r\n  classics, has discovered in the 16th-century manuscript, and still\r\n  more in the original miscellaneous works of Joinville, the letters,\r\n  deeds, &c., already alluded to, the materials for what we have already\r\n  called a conjectural restoration, which is not without its interest,\r\n  though perhaps it is possible for that interest to be exaggerated.\r\n\r\n  For merely general readers Buchon's or Michaud's editions of Joinville\r\n  will amply suffice. Both include translations into modern French,\r\n  which, however, are hardly necessary, for the language is very easy.\r\n  Natalis de Wailly's editions of 1868 and particularly 1874 are\r\n  critical editions, embodying the modern research connected with the\r\n  text, the value of which is considerable, but contestable. They are\r\n  accompanied by ample annotations and appendices, with illustrations of\r\n  great merit and value. Much valuable information appeared for the\r\n  first time in the edition of F. Michel (1859). To these may be added\r\n  A. F. Didot's _Études sur Joinville_ (1870) and H. F. Delaborde's\r\n  _Jean de Joinville_ (1894). A good sketch of the whole subject will be\r\n  found in Aubertin's _Histoire de la langue et de la littérature\r\n  françaises au moyen âge_, ii. 196-211; see also Gaston Paris, _Litt.\r\n  française au moyen âge_ (1893), and A. Debidour, _Les Chroniqueurs_\r\n  (1888). There are English translations by T. Johnes (1807), J. Hutton\r\n  (1868), Ethel Wedgwood (1906), and (more literally) Sir F. T. Marzials\r\n  (\"Everyman's Library,\" 1908).     (G. Sa.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOIST, in building, one of a row or tier of beams set edgewise from one\r\nwall or partition to another and carrying the flooring boards on the\r\nupper edge and the laths of the ceiling on the lower. In double flooring\r\nthere are three series of joists, _binding_, _bridging_, and _ceiling_\r\njoists. The binding joists are the real support of the floor, running\r\nfrom wall to wall, and carrying the bridging joists above and the\r\nceiling joists below (see CARPENTRY), The Mid. Eng. form of the word\r\nwas _giste_ or _gyste_, and was adapted from O. Fr. _giste_, modern\r\n_gîte_, a beam supporting the platform of a gun. By origin the word\r\nmeant that on which anything lies or rests (_gésir_, to lie; Lat.\r\n_jacere_).\r\n\r\nThe English word \"gist,\" in such phrases as \"the gist of the matter,\"\r\nthe main or central point in an argument, is a doublet of joist.\r\nAccording to Skeat, the origin of this meaning is an O. Fr. proverbial\r\nexpression, _Je sçay bien où gist le lièvre_, I know well where the hare\r\nlies, i.e. I know the real point of the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJÓKAI, MAURUS (1825-1904), Hungarian novelist, was born at Rév-Komárom\r\non the 19th of February 1825. His father, Joseph, was a member of the\r\nAsva branch of the ancient Jókay family; his mother was a scion of the\r\nnoble Pulays. The lad was timid and delicate, and therefore educated at\r\nhome till his tenth year, when he was sent to Pressburg, subsequently\r\ncompleting his education at the Calvinist college at Pápá, where he\r\nfirst met Petöfi, Alexander Kozma, and several other brilliant young men\r\nwho subsequently became famous. His family had meant him to follow the\r\nlaw, his father's profession, and accordingly the youth, always\r\nsingularly assiduous, plodded conscientiously through the usual\r\ncurriculum at Kecskemet and Pest, and as a full-blown advocate actually\r\nsucceeded in winning his first case. But the drudgery of a lawyer's\r\noffice was uncongenial to the ardently poetical youth, and, encouraged\r\nby the encomiums pronounced by the Hungarian Academy upon his first\r\nplay, _Zsidó fiu_ (\"The Jew Boy\"), he flitted, when barely twenty, to\r\nPest in 1845 with a MS. romance in his pocket; he was introduced by\r\nPetöfi to the literary notabilities of the Hungarian capital, and the\r\nsame year his first notable romance _Hétköznapok_ (\"Working Days\"),\r\nappeared, first in the columns of the _Pesti Dievatlap_, and\r\nsubsequently, in 1846, in book form. _Hétköznapok_, despite its manifest\r\ncrudities and extravagances, was instantly recognized by all the leading\r\ncritics as a work of original genius, and in the following year Jókai\r\nwas appointed the editor of _Életképek_, the leading Hungarian literary\r\njournal, and gathered round him all the rising talent of the country. On\r\nthe outbreak of the revolution of 1848 the young editor enthusiastically\r\nadopted the national cause, and served it with both pen and sword. Now,\r\nas ever, he was a moderate Liberal, setting his face steadily against\r\nall excesses; but, carried away by the Hungarian triumphs of April and\r\nMay 1849, he supported Kossuth's fatal blunder of deposing the Hapsburg\r\ndynasty, and though, after the war was over, his life was saved by an\r\ningenious stratagem of his wife, the great tragic actress, Roza Benke\r\nLaborfalvi, whom he had married on the 29th of August 1848, he lived for\r\nthe next fourteen years the life of a political suspect. Yet this was\r\nperhaps the most glorious period of his existence, for during it he\r\ndevoted himself to the rehabilitation of the proscribed and humiliated\r\nMagyar language, composing in it no fewer than thirty great romances,\r\nbesides innumerable volumes of tales, essays, criticisms and facetiæ.\r\nThis was the period of such masterpieces as _Erdély Arany Kord_ (\"The\r\nGolden Age of Transylvania\"), with its sequel _Törökvilág\r\nMagyarországon_ (\"The Turks in Hungary\"), _Egy Magyar Nábob_ (\"A\r\nHungarian Nabob\"), _Karpáthy Zoltán, Janicsárok végnapjai_ (\"The Last\r\nDays of the Janissaries\"), _Szomorú napok_ (\"Sad Days\"). On the\r\nre-establishment of the Hungarian constitution by the Composition of\r\n1867, Jókai took an active part in politics. As a constant supporter of\r\nthe Tisza administration, not only in parliament, where he sat\r\ncontinuously for more than twenty years, but also as the editor of the\r\ngovernment organ, _Hon_, founded by him in 1863, he became a power in\r\nthe state, and, though he never took office himself, frequently\r\nextricated the government from difficult places. In 1897 the emperor\r\nappointed him a member of the upper house. As a suave, practical and\r\nwitty debater he was particularly successful. Yet it was to literature\r\nthat he continued to devote most of his time, and his productiveness\r\nafter 1870 was stupendous, amounting to some hundreds of volumes.\r\nStranger still, none of this work is slipshod, and the best of it\r\ndeserves to endure. Amongst the finest of his later works may be\r\nmentioned the unique and incomparable _Az arany ember_ (\"A Man of\r\nGold\")--translated into English under the title of _Timar's Two\r\nWorlds_--and _A téngerzemü hölgy_ (\"Eyes like the Sea\"), the latter of\r\nwhich won the Academy's prize in 1890. He died at Budapest on the 5th of\r\nMay 1904; his wife having predeceased him in 1886. Jókai was an\r\narch-romantic, with a perfervid Oriental imagination, and humour of the\r\npurest, rarest description. If one can imagine a combination, in almost\r\nequal parts, of Walter Scott, William Beckford, Dumas _père_, and\r\nCharles Dickens, together with the native originality of an ardent\r\nMagyar, one may perhaps form a fair idea of the great Hungarian\r\nromancer's indisputable genius.\r\n\r\n  See Névy László, _Jókai Mór_; Hegedúsis Sándor, _Jókai Mórról_; H. W.\r\n  Temperley, \"Maurus Jokai and the Historical Novel,\" _Contemporary\r\n  Review_ (July 1904).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOKJAKARTA, or JOKJOKARTA (more correctly JOKYAKARTA; Du.\r\n_Djokjakarta_), a residency of the island of Java, Dutch East Indies,\r\nbounded N. by Kedu and Surakarta, E. by Surakarta, S. by the Indian\r\nOcean, W. by Bagelen. Pop. (1897), 858,392. The country is mountainous\r\nwith the exception of a wedge-like strip in the middle between the\r\nrivers Progo and Upak. In the north-west are the southern slopes of the\r\nvolcano Merapi, and in the east the Kidul hills and the plateau of Sewu.\r\nThe last-named is an arid and scantily populated chalk range, with\r\nnumerous small summits, whence it is also known as the Thousand Hills.\r\nThe remainder of the residency is well-watered and fertile, important\r\nirrigation works having been carried out. Sugar, rice and indigo are\r\ncultivated; salt-making is practised on the coast. The minerals include\r\ncoal-beds in the Kidul hills and near Nangulan, marble and gold in the\r\nneighbourhood of Kalasan. The natives are poor, owing chiefly to\r\nmaladministration, the use of opium and the usury practised by\r\nforeigners (Chinese, Arabs, &c.). The principality is divided between\r\nthe sultan (vassal of the Dutch government) and the so-called\r\nindependent prince Paku Alam; Ngawen and Imogiri are enclaves of\r\nSurakarta. There are good roads, and railways connect the chief town\r\nwith Batavia, Samarang, Surakarta, &c. The town of Jokjakarta (see JAVA)\r\nthe seat of the resident, the sultan and the Paku Alam princes; its most\r\nremarkable section is the _kraton_ or citadel of the sultan. Imogiri,\r\nS.W. of the capital, the burial-place of the princes of Surakarta and\r\nJokjakarta, is guarded by priests and officials. Sentolo, Nangulan,\r\nBrosot, Kalasan, Tempel, Wonosari are considerable villages. There are\r\nnumerous remains of Hindu temples, particularly in the neighbourhood of\r\nKalasan near the border of Surakarta and Prambanan, which is just across\r\nit. Remarkable sacred grottoes are found on the coast, namely, the\r\nso-called Nyabi Kidul and Rongkob, and at Selarong, south-east of\r\nJokjakarta.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOLIET, a city and the county-seat of Will county, Illinois, U.S.A., in\r\nthe township of Joliet, in the N.E. part of the state, on the Des\r\nPlaines river, 40 m. S.W. of Chicago. Pop. (1890), 23,264; (1900),\r\n29,353, of whom 8536 were foreign-born, 1889 being German, 1579\r\nAustrian, 1206 Irish and 951 Swedish; (1910 census) 34,670. In addition\r\nthere is a large population in the immediate suburbs: that of the\r\ntownship including the city was 27,438 in 1890, and 50,640 in 1910.\r\nJoliet is served by the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fé, the Chicago &\r\nAlton, the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific, the Michigan Central, the\r\nIllinois, Iowa & Minnesota, and the Elgin, Joliet & Eastern railways, by\r\ninterurban electric lines, and is on the Illinois & Michigan canal and\r\nthe Chicago Sanitary (ship) canal. The city is situated in a narrow\r\nvalley, on both sides of the river. It is the seat of the northern\r\nIllinois penitentiary, and has a public library (in front of which is a\r\nstatue, by S. Asbjornsen, of Louis Joliet), the township high school,\r\ntwo hospitals, two Catholic academies and a club-house, erected by the\r\nIllinois Steel Company for the use of its employees. There are two\r\nmunicipal parks, West Park and Highland Park; Dellwood Park is an\r\namusement resort, owned by the Chicago & Joliet Electric Railway\r\nCompany. In the vicinity are large deposits of calcareous building\r\nstone, cement and fireclay, and there are coal mines 20 m. distant.\r\nMineral resources and water-power have facilitated the development of\r\nmanufactures. The factory product in 1905 was valued at $33,788,700\r\n(20.3% more than in 1900), a large part of which was represented by\r\niron and steel goods. There are large industrial establishments just\r\noutside the city limits. The first settlement on the site of Joliet\r\n(1833) was called Juliet, in honour of the daughter of James B.\r\nCampbell, one of the settlers. The present name was adopted in 1845, in\r\nmemory of Louis Joliet (1645-1700), the French Canadian explorer of the\r\nMississippi, and in 1852 a city charter was secured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOLLY (from O. Fr. _jolif_; Fr. _joli_, the French word is obscure in\r\norigin; it may be from late Lat. _gaudivus_, from _gaudere_, to rejoice,\r\nthe change of _d_ to _l_ being paralleled by _cigada_ and _cigale_, or\r\nfrom O. Norse _jol_, Eng. \"yule,\" the northern festival of midwinter),\r\nand adjective meaning gay, cheerful, jovial, high-spirited. The\r\ncolloquial use of the term as an intensive adverb, meaning extremely,\r\nvery, was in early usage quite literary; thus John Trapp (1601-1669),\r\n_Commentaries on the New Testament, Matthew_ (1647), writes, \"All was\r\njolly quiet at Ephesus before St Paul came hither.\" In the royal navy\r\n\"jolly\" used as a substantive, is the slang name for a marine. To\r\n\"jolly\" is a slang synonym for \"chaff.\" The word \"jolly-boat,\" the name\r\nof a ship's small broad boat, usually clinker-built, is of doubtful\r\netymology. It occurs in English in the 18th century, and is usually\r\nconnected with Dan. or Swed. _jolle_, Dutch _jol_, a small ship's boat;\r\nthese words are properly represented in English by \"yawl\" originally a\r\nship's small boat, now chiefly used of a rig of sailing vessels, with a\r\ncutter-rigged foremast and a small mizzen stepped far aft, with a\r\nspanker sail (see RIGGING). A connexion has been suggested with a word\r\nof much earlier appearance in English, _jolywat_, or _gellywatte_. This\r\noccurs at the end of the 15th century and is used of a smaller type of\r\nship's boat. This is supposed to be a corruption of the French _galiote_\r\nor Dutch _galjoot_, galliot (see GALLEY). The galliot was, however, a\r\nlarge vessel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOLY DE LOTBINIÈRE, SIR HENRI GUSTAVE (1829-1908), Canadian politician,\r\nwas born at Epernay in France on the 5th of December 1829. His father,\r\nGaspard Pierre Gustave Joly, the owner of famous vineyards at Epernay,\r\nwas of Huguenot descent, and married Julie Christine, grand-daughter of\r\nEustache Gaspard Michel Chartier de Lotbinière, marquis de Lotbinière\r\n(one of Montcalm's engineers at Quebec); he thus became seigneur de\r\nLotbinière. Henri Gustave adopted the name of de Lotbinière in 1888,\r\nunder a statute of the province of Quebec. He was educated in Paris, and\r\ncalled to the bar of lower Canada in 1858. On the 6th of May 1856 he\r\nmarried Margaretta Josepha (d. 1904), daughter of Hammond Gowen, of\r\nQuebec. At the general election of 1861 he was elected to the house of\r\nassembly of the province of Canada as Liberal member for the county of\r\nLotbinière, and from 1867 to 1874 he represented the same county in the\r\nHouse of Commons, Ottawa, and in the legislative assembly, Quebec. Joly\r\nwas opposed to confederation and supported Dorion in the stand which he\r\ntook on this question. In 1878 he was called by Luc Letellier de St\r\nJust, lieutenant-governor of Quebec, to form an administration, which\r\nwas defeated in 1879, and until 1883 he was leader of the opposition.\r\nDuring his brief administration he adopted a policy of retrenchment, and\r\nendeavoured to abolish the legislative council. In 1885, as a protest\r\nagainst the attitude of his party towards Louis Riel, who was tried and\r\nexecuted for high treason, he retired from public life. Early in the\r\nyear 1895 he was induced again to take an active part in the campaign of\r\nhis party, and at the general election of 1896 he was returned as member\r\nfor the county of Portneuf. He had already in 1895 been created K.C.M.G.\r\nOn the formation of Sir Wilfrid Laurier's administration he accepted the\r\noffice of controller of inland revenue, and a year later he became a\r\nprivy councillor, as minister of inland revenue. From 1900 to 1906 he\r\nwas lieutenant-governor of the province of British Columbia. He twice\r\ndeclined a seat in the senate, but rendered eminent service to Canada by\r\npromoting the interest of agriculture, horticulture and of forestry. He\r\ndied on the 17th of November 1908.     (A. G. D.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOMINI, ANTOINE HENRI, BARON (1779-1869), general in the French and\r\nafterwards in the Russian service, and one of the most celebrated\r\nwriters on the art of war, was born on the 6th of March 1779 at Payerne\r\nin the canton of Vaud, Switzerland, where his father was syndic. His\r\nyouthful preference for a military life was disappointed by the\r\ndissolution of the Swiss regiments of France at the Revolution. For some\r\ntime he was a clerk in a Paris banking-house, until the outbreak of the\r\nSwiss revolution. At the age of nineteen he was appointed to a post on\r\nthe Swiss headquarters staff, and when scarcely twenty-one to the\r\ncommand of a battalion. At the peace of Lunéville in 1801 he returned to\r\nbusiness life in Paris, but devoted himself chiefly to preparing the\r\ncelebrated _Traité des grandes opérations militaires_, which was\r\npublished in 1804-1805. Introduced to Marshal Ney, he served in the\r\ncampaign of Austerlitz as a volunteer aide-de-camp on Ney's personal\r\nstaff. In December 1805 Napoleon, being much impressed by a chapter in\r\nJomini's treatise, made him a colonel in the French service. Ney\r\nthereupon made him his principal aide-de-camp. In 1806 Jomini published\r\nhis views as to the conduct of the impending war with Prussia, and this,\r\nalong with his knowledge of Frederick the Great's campaigns, which he\r\nhad described in the _Traité_, led Napoleon to attach him to his own\r\nheadquarters. He was present with Napoleon at the battle of Jena, and at\r\nEylau won the cross of the Legion of Honour. After the peace of Tilsit\r\nhe was made chief of the staff to Ney, and created a baron. In the\r\nSpanish campaign of 1808 his advice was often of the highest value to\r\nthe marshal, but Jomini quarrelled with his chief, and was left almost\r\nat the mercy of his numerous enemies, especially Berthier, the emperor's\r\nchief of staff. Overtures had been made to him, as early as 1807, to\r\nenter the Russian service, but Napoleon, hearing of his intention to\r\nleave the French army, compelled him to remain in the service with the\r\nrank of general of brigade. For some years thereafter Jomini held both a\r\nFrench and a Russian commission, with the consent of both sovereigns.\r\nBut when war between France and Russia broke out, he was in a difficult\r\nposition, which he ended by taking a command on the line of\r\ncommunication. He was thus engaged when the retreat from Moscow and the\r\nuprising of Prussia transferred the seat of war to central Germany. He\r\npromptly rejoined Ney, took part in the battle of Lützen and, as chief\r\nof the staff of Ney's group of corps, rendered distinguished services\r\nbefore and at the battle of Bautzen, and was recommended for the rank of\r\ngeneral of division. Berthier, however, not only erased Jomini's name\r\nfrom the list, but put him under arrest and censured him in army orders\r\nfor failing to supply certain returns that had been called for. How far\r\nJomini was held responsible for certain misunderstandings which\r\nprevented the attainment of all the results hoped for from Ney's attack\r\n(see BAUTZEN) there is no means of knowing. But the pretext for censure\r\nwas trivial and baseless, and during the armistice Jomini did as he had\r\nintended to do in 1809-10, and went into the Russian service. As things\r\nthen were, this was tantamount to deserting to the enemy, and so it was\r\nregarded by Napoleon and by the French army, and by not a few of his new\r\ncomrades. It must be observed, in Jomini's defence, that he had for\r\nyears held a dormant commission in the Russian army, that he had\r\ndeclined to take part in the invasion of Russia in 1812, and that he was\r\na Swiss and not a Frenchman. His patriotism was indeed unquestioned, and\r\nhe withdrew from the Allied Army in 1814 when he found that he could not\r\nprevent the violation of Swiss neutrality. Apart from love of his own\r\ncountry, the desire to study, to teach and to practise the art of war\r\nwas his ruling motive. At the critical moment of the battle of Eylau he\r\nexclaimed, \"If I were the Russian commander for two hours!\" On joining\r\nthe allies he received the rank of lieutenant-general and the\r\nappointment of aide-de-camp from the tsar, and rendered important\r\nassistance during the German campaign, though the charge that he\r\nbetrayed the numbers, positions and intentions of the French to the\r\nenemy was later acknowledged by Napoleon to be without foundation. He\r\ndeclined as a Swiss patriot and as a French officer to take part in the\r\npassage of the Rhine at Basel and the subsequent invasion of France.\r\n\r\nIn 1815 he was with the emperor Alexander in Paris, and attempted in\r\nvain to save the life of his old commander Ney. This almost cost him\r\nhis position in the Russian service, but he succeeded in making head\r\nagainst his enemies, and took part in the congress of Vienna. Resuming,\r\nafter a period of several years of retirement and literary work, his\r\npost in the Russian army, he was about 1823 made a full general, and\r\nthenceforward until his retirement in 1829 he was principally employed\r\nin the military education of the tsarevich Nicholas (afterwards emperor)\r\nand in the organization of the Russian staff college, which was opened\r\nin 1832 and still bears its original name of the Nicholas academy. In\r\n1828 he was employed in the field in the Russo-Turkish War, and at the\r\nsiege of Varna he was given the grand cordon of the Alexander order.\r\nThis was his last active service. In 1829 he settled at Brussels where\r\nhe chiefly lived for the next thirty years. In 1853, after trying\r\nwithout success to bring about a political understanding between France\r\nand Russia, Jomini was called to St Petersburg to act as a military\r\nadviser to the tsar during the Crimean War. He returned to Brussels on\r\nthe conclusion of peace in 1856 and some years afterwards settled at\r\nPassy near Paris. He was busily employed up to the end of his life in\r\nwriting treatises, pamphlets and open letters on subjects of military\r\nart and history, and in 1859 he was asked by Napoleon III. to furnish a\r\nplan of campaign in the Italian War. One of his last essays dealt with\r\nthe war of 1866 and the influence of the breech-loading rifle, and he\r\ndied at Passy on the 24th of March 1869 only a year before the\r\nFranco-German War. Thus one of the earliest of the great military\r\ntheorists lived to speculate on the tactics of the present day.\r\n\r\n  Amongst his numerous works the principal, besides the _Traité_, are:\r\n  _Histoire critique et militaire des campagnes de la Révolution_ (1806;\r\n  new ed. 1819-1824); _Vie politique et militaire de Napoléon racontée\r\n  par lui-même_ (1827) and, perhaps the best known of all his\r\n  publications, the theoretical _Précis de l'art de la guerre_ (1836).\r\n\r\n  See Ferdinand Lecomte, _Le Général Jomini, sa vie et ses écrits_\r\n  (1861; new ed. 1888); C. A. Saint-Beuve, _Le Général Jomini_ (1869);\r\n  A. Pascal, _Observations historiques sur la vie, &c., du général\r\n  Jomini_ (1842).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOMMELLI, NICCOLA (1714-1774), Italian composer, was born at Aversa near\r\nNaples on the 10th of September 1714. He received his musical education\r\nat two of the famous music schools of that capital, being a pupil of the\r\nConservatorio de' poveri di Gesù Cristo under Feo, and also of the\r\nConservatorio della pietà dei Turchini under Prota, Mancini and Leo. His\r\nfirst opera, _L'Errore amoroso_, was successfully produced at Naples\r\n(under a pseudonym) when Jommelli was only twenty-three. Three years\r\nafterwards he went to Rome to bring out two new operas, and thence to\r\nBologna, where he profited by the advice of Padre Martini, the greatest\r\ncontrapuntist of his age. In the meantime Jommelli's fame began to\r\nspread beyond the limits of his country, and in 1748 he went for the\r\nfirst time to Vienna, where one of his finest operas, _Didone_, was\r\nproduced. Three years later he returned to Italy, and in 1753 he\r\nobtained the post of chapel-master to the duke of Württemberg at\r\nStuttgart, which city he made his home for a number of years. In the\r\nsame year he had ten commissions to write operas for princely courts. In\r\nStuttgart he permitted no operas but his own to be produced, and he\r\nmodified his style in accordance with German taste, so much that, when\r\nafter an absence of fifteen years he returned to Naples, his countrymen\r\nhissed two of his operas off the stage. He retired in consequence to his\r\nnative village, and only occasionally emerged from his solitude to take\r\npart in the musical life of the capital. His death took place on the\r\n25th of August 1774, his last composition being the celebrated\r\n_Miserere_, a setting for two female voices of Saverio Mattei's Italian\r\nparaphrase of Psalm li. Jommelli is the most representative composer of\r\nthe generation following Leo and Durante. He approaches very closely to\r\nMozart in his style, and is important as one of the composers who, by\r\nwelding together German and Italian characteristics, helped to form the\r\nmusical language of the great composers of the classical period of\r\nVienna.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJONAH, in the Bible, a prophet born at Gath-hepher in Zebulun, perhaps\r\nunder Jeroboam (2) (781-741 B.C.?), who foretold the deliverance of\r\nIsrael from the Aramaeans (2 Kings xiv. 25). This prophet may also be\r\nthe hero of the much later book of Jonah, but how different a man is\r\nhe! It is, however, the later Jonah who chiefly interests us. New\r\nproblems have arisen out of the book which relates to him, but here we\r\ncan only attempt to consider what, in a certain sense, may be called the\r\nsurface meaning of the text.\r\n\r\nThis, then is what we appear to be told. The prophet Jonah is summoned\r\nto go to Nineveh, a great and wicked city (cf. 4 Esdras ii. 8, 9), and\r\nprophesy against it. Jonah, however, is afraid (iv. 2) that the\r\nNinevites may repent, so, instead of going to Nineveh, he proceeds to\r\nJoppa, and takes his passage in a ship bound for Tarshish. But soon a\r\nstorm arises, and, supplication to the gods failing, the sailors cast\r\nlots to discover the guilty man who has brought this great trouble. The\r\nlot falls on Jonah, who has been roughly awakened by the captain, and\r\nwhen questioned frankly owns that he is a Hebrew and a worshipper of the\r\ndivine creator Yahweh, from whom he has sought to flee (as if He were\r\nonly the god of Canaan). Jonah advises the sailors to throw him into the\r\nsea. This, after praying to Yahweh, they actually do; at once the sea\r\nbecomes calm and they sacrifice to Yahweh. Meantime God has \"appointed a\r\ngreat fish\" which swallows up Jonah. Three days and three nights he is\r\nin the fish's belly, till, at a word from Yahweh, it vomits Jonah on to\r\nthe dry ground. Again Jonah receives the divine call. This time he\r\nobeys. After delivering his message to Nineveh he makes himself a booth\r\noutside the walls and waits in vain for the destruction of the city\r\n(probably iv. 5 is misplaced and should stand after iii. 4). Thereupon\r\nJonah beseeches Yahweh to take away his worthless life. As an answer\r\nYahweh \"appoints\" a small quickly-growing tree with large leaves (the\r\ncastor-oil plant) to come up over the angry prophet and shelter him from\r\nthe sun. But the next day the beneficent tree perishes by God's\r\n\"appointment\" from a worm-bite. Once more God \"appoints\" something; it\r\nis the east wind, which, together with the fierce heat, brings Jonah\r\nagain to desperation. The close is fine, and reminds us of Job. God\r\nhimself gives short-sighted man a lesson. Jonah has pitied the tree, and\r\nshould not God have pity on so great a city?\r\n\r\nTwo results of criticism are widely accepted. One relates to the psalm\r\nin ch. ii., which has been transferred from some other place; it is in\r\nfact an anticipatory thanksgiving for the deliverance of Israel, mostly\r\ncomposed of phrases from other psalms. The other is that the narrative\r\nbefore us is not historical but an imaginative story (such as was called\r\na Midrash) based upon Biblical data and tending to edification. It is,\r\nhowever, a story of high type. The narrator considered that Israel had\r\nto be a prophet to the \"nations\" at large, that Israel had, like Jonah,\r\nneglected its duty and for its punishment was \"swallowed up\" in foreign\r\nlands. God had watched over His people and prepared its choicer members\r\nto fulfil His purpose. This company of faithful but not always\r\nsufficiently charitable men represented their people, so that it might\r\nbe said that Israel itself (the second Isaiah's \"Servant of Yahweh\"--see\r\nISAIAH) had taken up its duty, but in an ungenial spirit which grieved\r\nthe All-merciful One. The book, which is post-exilic, may therefore be\r\ngrouped with another Midrash, the Book of Ruth, which also appears to\r\nrepresent a current of thought opposed to the exclusive spirit of Jewish\r\nlegalism.\r\n\r\nSome critics, however, think that the key of symbolism needs to be\r\nsupplemented by that of mythology. The \"great fish\" especially has a\r\nvery mythological appearance. The Babylonian dragon myth (see COSMOGONY)\r\nis often alluded to in the Old Testament, e.g. in Jer. li. 44, which, as\r\nthe present writer long since pointed out, may supply the missing link\r\nbetween Jonah i. 17 and the original myth. For the \"great fish\" is\r\nultimately Tiamat, the dragon of chaos, represented historically by\r\nNebuchadrezzar, by whom for a time God permitted or \"appointed\" Israel\r\nto be swallowed up.\r\n\r\n  For further details see T. K. Cheyne, _Ency. Bib._, \"Jonah\"; and his\r\n  article \"Jonah, a Study in Jewish Folklore and Religion,\" _Theological\r\n  Review_ (1877), pp. 211-219. König, Hastings's _Dict. Bible_, \"Jonah,\"\r\n  is full but not lucid; C. H. H. Wright, _Biblical Studies_ (1886)\r\n  argues ably for the symbolic theory. Against Cheyne, see Marti's work\r\n  on the _Minor Prophets_ (1894); the \"great fish\" and the \"three days\r\n  and three nights\" remain unexplained by this writer. On these points\r\n  see Zimmern, _K.A.T._ (3), pp. 366, 389, 508. The difficulties of the\r\n  mission of a Hebrew prophet to Asshur are diminished by Cheyne's later\r\n  theory, _Critica Biblica_ (1904), pp. 150-152.     (T. K. C.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJONAH, RABBI (ABULWALID MERWAN IBN JANAH, also R. MARINUS) (c. 990-c.\r\n1050), the greatest Hebrew grammarian and lexicographer of the middle\r\nages. He was born before the year 990, in Cordova, studied in Lucena,\r\nleft his native city in 1012, and, after somewhat protracted wanderings,\r\nsettled in Saragossa, where he died before 1050. He was a physician, and\r\nIbn Abi Usaibia, in his treatise on Arabian doctors, mentions him as the\r\nauthor of a medical work. But Rabbi Jonah saw the true vocation of his\r\nlife in the scientific investigation of the Hebrew language and in a\r\nrational biblical exegesis based upon sound linguistic knowledge. It is\r\ntrue, he wrote no actual commentary on the Bible, but his philological\r\nworks exercised the greatest influence on Judaic exegesis. His first\r\nwork--composed, like all the rest, in Arabic--bears the title\r\n_Almustalha_, and forms, as is indicated by the word, a criticism and at\r\nthe same time a supplement to the two works of Yehuda 'Hayyuj on the\r\nverbs with weak-sounding and double-sounding roots. These two tractates,\r\nwith which 'Hayyuj had laid the foundations of scientific Hebrew\r\ngrammar, were recognized by Abulwalid as the basis of his own\r\ngrammatical investigations, and Abraham Ibn Daud, when enumerating the\r\ngreat Spanish Jews in his history, sums up the significance of R. Jonah\r\nin the words: \"He completed what 'Hayyuj had begun.\" The principal work\r\nof R. Jonah is the _Kitab al Tankih_ (\"Book of Exact Investigation\"),\r\nwhich consists of two parts, regarded as two distinct books--the _Kitab\r\nal-Luma_ (\"Book of Many-coloured Flower-beds\") and the _Kitab al-usul_\r\n(\"Book of Roots\"). The former (ed. J. Derenbourg, Paris, 1886) contains\r\nthe grammar, the latter (ed. Ad. Neubauer, Oxford, 1875) the lexicon of\r\nthe Hebrew language. Both works are also published in the Hebrew\r\ntranslation of Yehuda Ibn Tibbon (_Sefer Ha-Rikmah_, ed. B. Goldberg,\r\nFrankfurt am Main, 1855; _Sefer Ha-Schoraschim_, ed. W. Bacher, Berlin,\r\n1897). The other writings of Rabbi Jonah, so far as extant, have\r\nappeared in an edition of the Arabic original accompanied by a French\r\ntranslation (_Opuscules et traités d'Abou'l Walid_, ed. Joseph and\r\nHartwig Derenbourg, Paris 1880). A few fragments and numerous quotations\r\nin his principal book form our only knowledge of the _Kitab al-Tashwir_\r\n(\"Book of Refutation\") a controversial work in four parts, in which\r\nRabbi Jonah successfully repelled the attacks of the opponents of his\r\nfirst treatise. At the head of this opposition stood the famous Samuel\r\nIbn Nagdela (S. Ha-Nagid) a disciple of 'Hayyuj. The grammatical work of\r\nRabbi Jonah extended, moreover, to the domain of rhetoric and biblical\r\nhermeneutics, and his lexicon contains many exegetical excursuses. This\r\nlexicon is of especial importance by reason of its ample contribution to\r\nthe comparative philology of the Semitic languages--Hebrew and Arabic,\r\nin particular. Abulwalid's works mark the culminating point of Hebrew\r\nscholarship during the middle ages, and he attained a level which was\r\nnot surpassed till the modern development of philological science in the\r\n19th century.\r\n\r\n  See S. Munk, _Notice sur Abou'l Walid_ (Paris, 1851); W. Bacher,\r\n  _Leben und Werke des Abulwalid und die Quellen seiner\r\n  Schrifterklärung_ (Leipzig, 1885); id., _Aus der Schrifterklärung des\r\n  Abulwalid_ (Leipzig, 1889); id., _Die hebr.-arabische\r\n  Sprachvergleichung des Abulwalid_ (Vienna, 1884); id., _Die\r\n  hebräisch-neuhebräische und hebr.-aramäische Sprachvergleichung des\r\n  Abulwalid_ (Vienna, 1885).     (W. Ba.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJONAS, JUSTUS (1493-1555), German Protestant reformer, was born at\r\nNordhausen in Thuringia, on the 5th of June 1493. His real name was\r\nJodokus (Jobst) Koch, which he changed according to the common custom of\r\nGerman scholars in the 16th century, when at the university of Erfurt.\r\nHe entered that university in 1506, studied law and the humanities, and\r\nbecame Master of Arts in 1510. In 1511 he went to Wittenberg, where he\r\ntook his bachelor's degree in law. He returned to Erfurt in 1514 or\r\n1515, was ordained priest, and in 1518 was promoted doctor in both\r\nfaculties and appointed to a well-endowed canonry in the church of St\r\nSeverus, to which a professorship of law was attached. His great\r\nadmiration for Erasmus first led him to Greek and biblical studies, and\r\nhis election in May 1519 as rector of the university was regarded as a\r\ntriumph for the partisans of the New Learning. It was not, however,\r\nuntil after the Leipzig disputation with Eck that Luther won his\r\nallegiance. He accompanied Luther to Worms in 1521, and there was\r\nappointed by the elector of Saxony professor of canon law at Wittenberg.\r\nDuring Luther's stay in the Wartburg Jonas was one of the most active of\r\nthe Wittenberg reformers. Giving himself up to preaching and polemics,\r\nhe aided the Reformation by his gift as a translator, turning Luther's\r\nand Melanchthon's works into German or Latin as the case might be, thus\r\nbecoming a sort of double of both. He was busied in conferences and\r\nvisitations during the next twenty years, and in diplomatic work with\r\nthe princes. In 1541 he began a successful preaching crusade in Halle;\r\nhe became superintendent of its churches in 1542. In 1546 he was present\r\nat Luther's deathbed at Eisleben, and preached the funeral sermon; but\r\nin the same year was banished from the duchy by Maurice, duke (later\r\nelector) of Saxony. From that time until his death, Jonas was unable to\r\nsecure a satisfactory living. He wandered from place to place preaching,\r\nand finally went to Eisfeld (1553), where he died. He had been married\r\nthree times.\r\n\r\n  See _Briefswechsel des Justus Jonas, gesammelt und bearbeitet von G.\r\n  Kawerau_ (2 vols., Halle, 1884-1885); Kawerau's article in\r\n  Herzog-Hauck, _Realencyklopädie_, ed. 3, with bibliography.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJONATHAN (Heb. \"Yah [weh] gives\"). Of the many Jewish bearers of this\r\nname, three are well known: (1) the grandson of Moses, who was priest at\r\nDan (Judg. xviii. 30). The reading Manasseh (see R.V. mg.; obtained by\r\ninserting _n_ above the consonantal text in the Hebrew) is apparently\r\nintended to suggest that he was the son of that idolatrous king. (2) The\r\neldest son of Saul, who, together with his father, freed Israel from the\r\ncrushing oppression of the Philistines (1 Sam. xiii. seq.). Both are\r\nlauded in an elegy quoted from the Book of Jashar (2 Sam. i.) for their\r\nwarm mutual love, their heroism, and their labours on behalf of the\r\npeople. Jonathan's name is most familiar for the firm friendship which\r\nsubsisted between him and David (1 Sam. xviii. 1-4; xix. 1-7; xx., xxii.\r\n8; xxiii. 16-18), and when he fell at the battle of Gilboa and left\r\nbehind him a young child (1 Sam. xxxi.; 2 Sam. iv. 4), David took charge\r\nof the youth and gave him a place at his court (2 Sam. ix.). See further\r\nDAVID, SAUL. (3) The Maccabee (see JEWS; MACCABEES).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJONCIÈRES, VICTORIN (1839-1903), French composer, was born in Paris on\r\nthe 12th of April 1839. He first devoted his attention to painting, but\r\nafterwards took up the serious study of music. He entered the Paris\r\nConservatoire, but did not remain there long, because he had espoused\r\ntoo warmly the cause of Wagner against his professor. He composed the\r\nfollowing operas: _Sardanapale_ (1867), _Le Dernier jour de Pompéi_\r\n(1869), _Dimitri_ (1876), _La Reine Berthe_ (1878), _Le Chevalier Jean_\r\n(1885), _Lancelot_ (1900). He also wrote incidental music to _Hamlet_, a\r\nsymphony, and other works. Joncières' admiration for Wagner asserted\r\nitself rather in a musical than a dramatic sense. The influence of the\r\nGerman master's earlier style can be traced in his operas. Joncières,\r\nhowever, adhered to the recognized forms of the French opera and did not\r\nmodel his works according to the later developments of the Wagnerian\r\n\"music drama.\" He may indeed be said to have been at least as much\r\ninfluenced by Gounod as by Wagner. From 1871 he was musical critic for\r\n_La Liberté_. He died on the 26th of October 1903.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJONES, ALFRED GILPIN (1824-1906), Canadian politician, was born at\r\nWeymouth, Nova Scotia, in September 1824, the son of Guy C. Jones of\r\nYarmouth, and grandson of a United Empire Loyalist. In 1865 he opposed\r\nthe federation of the British American provinces, and, in his anger at\r\nthe refusal of the British government to repeal such portions of the\r\nBritish North America Act as referred to Nova Scotia, made a speech\r\nwhich won for him the name of Haul-down-the-flag Jones. He was for many\r\nyears a member of the Federal Parliament, and for a few months in 1878\r\nwas minister of militia under the Liberal government. Largely owing to\r\nhis influence the Liberal party refused in 1878 to abandon its Free\r\nTrade policy, an obstinacy which led to its defeat in that year. In 1900\r\nhe was appointed lieutenant-governor of his native province, and held\r\nthis position till his death on the 15th of March 1906.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJONES, SIR ALFRED LEWIS (1845-1909), British shipowner, was born in\r\nCarmarthenshire, in 1845. At the age of twelve he was apprenticed to the\r\nmanagers of the African Steamship Company at Liverpool, making several\r\nvoyages to the west coast of Africa. By the time he was twenty-six he\r\nhad risen to be manager of the business. Not finding sufficient scope in\r\nthis post, he borrowed money to purchase two or three small sailing\r\nvessels, and started in the shipping business on his own account. The\r\nventure succeeded, and he made additions to his fleet, but after a few\r\nyears' successful trading, realizing that sailing ships were about to be\r\nsuperseded by steamers, he sold his vessels. About this time (1891)\r\nMessrs. Elder, Dempster & Co., who purchased the business of the old\r\nAfrican Steamship Company, offered him a managerial post. This offer he\r\naccepted, subject to Messrs. Elder, Dempster selling him a number of\r\ntheir shares, and he thus acquired an interest in the business, and\r\nsubsequently, by further share purchases, its control. See further\r\nSTEAMSHIP LINES. In 1901 he was knighted. Sir Alfred Jones took a keen\r\ninterest in imperial affairs, and was instrumental in founding the\r\nLiverpool school of tropical medicine. He acquired considerable\r\nterritorial interests in West Africa, and financial interests in many of\r\nthe companies engaged in opening up and developing that part of the\r\nworld. He also took the leading part in opening up a new line of\r\ncommunication with the West Indies, and stimulating the Jamaica fruit\r\ntrade and tourist traffic. He died on the 13th of December 1909, leaving\r\nlarge charitable bequests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJONES, EBENEZER (1820-1860), British poet, was born in Islington,\r\nLondon, on the 20th of January 1820. His father, who was of Welsh\r\nextraction, was a strict Calvinist, and Ebenezer was educated at a dull,\r\nmiddle-class school. The death of his father obliged him to become a\r\nclerk in the office of a tea merchant. Shelley and Carlyle were his\r\nspiritual masters, and he spent all his spare time in reading and\r\nwriting; but he developed an exaggerated style of thought and\r\nexpression, due partly to a defective education. The unkind reception of\r\nhis _Studies of Sensation and Event_ (1843) seemed to be the last drop\r\nin his bitter cup of life. Baffled and disheartened, he destroyed his\r\nmanuscripts. He earned his living as an accountant and by literary hack\r\nwork, and it was not until he was rapidly dying of consumption that he\r\nwrote his three remarkable poems, \"Winter Hymn to the Snow,\" \"When the\r\nWorld is Burning\" and \"To Death.\" The fame that these and some of the\r\npieces in the early volume brought to their author came too late. He\r\ndied on the 14th of September 1860.\r\n\r\n  It was not till 1870 that Dante Gabriel Rossetti praised his work in\r\n  _Notes and Queries_. Rossetti's example was followed by W. B. Scott,\r\n  Theodore Watts-Dunton, who contributed some papers on the subject to\r\n  the _Athenaeum_ (September and October 1878), and R. H. Sheppard, who\r\n  edited _Studies of Sensation and Event_ in 1879.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJONES, ERNEST CHARLES (1819-1869), English Chartist, was born at Berlin\r\non the 25th of January 1819, and educated in Germany. His father, an\r\nofficer in the British army, was then equerry to the duke of\r\nCumberland--afterwards king of Hanover. In 1838 Jones came to England,\r\nand in 1841 published anonymously _The Wood Spirit_, a romantic novel.\r\nThis was followed by some songs and poems. In 1844 he was called to the\r\nbar at the Middle Temple. In 1845 he joined the Chartist agitation,\r\nquickly becoming its most prominent figure, and vigorously carrying on\r\nthe party's campaign on the platform and in the press. His speeches, in\r\nwhich he openly advocated physical force, led to his prosecution, and he\r\nwas sentenced in 1848 to two years' imprisonment for sedition. While in\r\nprison he wrote, it is said in his own blood on leaves torn from a\r\nprayer-book, _The Revolt of Hindostan_, an epic poem. On his release he\r\nagain became the leader of what remained of the Chartist party and\r\neditor of its organ. But he was almost its only public speaker; he was\r\nout of sympathy with the other leading Chartists, and soon joined the\r\nadvanced Radical party. Thenceforward he devoted himself to law and\r\nliterature, writing novels, tales and political songs. He made several\r\nunsuccessful attempts to enter parliament, and was about to contest\r\nManchester, with the certainty of being returned, when he died there on\r\nthe 26th of January 1869. He is believed to have sacrificed a\r\nconsiderable fortune rather than abandon his Chartist principles. His\r\nwife was Jane Atherley; and his son, Llewellyn Atherley-Jones, K.C. (b.\r\n1851), became a well-known barrister and Liberal member of parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJONES, HENRY (1831-1899), English author, well known as a writer on\r\nwhist under his _nom de guerre_ \"Cavendish,\" was born in London on the\r\n2nd of November 1831, being the eldest son of Henry D. Jones, a medical\r\npractitioner. He adopted his father's profession, established himself in\r\n1852 and continued for sixteen years in practice in London. The father\r\nwas a keen devotee of whist, and under his eye the son became early in\r\nlife a good player. He was a member of several whist clubs, among them\r\nthe \"Cavendish,\" and in 1862 appeared his _Principles of Whist, stated\r\nand explained by_ \"_Cavendish_,\" which was destined to become the\r\nleading authority as to the practice of the game. This work was followed\r\nby treatises on the laws of piquet and écarté. \"Cavendish\" also wrote on\r\nbilliards, lawn tennis and croquet, and contributed articles on whist\r\nand other games to the ninth edition of the _Encyclopaedia Britannica_.\r\n\"'Cavendish' was not a law-maker, but he codified and commented upon the\r\nlaws which had been made during many generations of card-playing.\" One\r\nof the most noteworthy points in his character was the manner in which\r\nhe kept himself abreast of improvements in his favourite game. He died\r\non the 10th of February 1899.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJONES, HENRY ARTHUR (1851-   ), English dramatist, was born at\r\nGrandborough, Buckinghamshire, on the 28th of September 1851 the son of\r\nSilvanus Jones, a farmer. He began to earn his living early, his spare\r\ntime being given to literary pursuits. He was twenty-seven before his\r\nfirst piece, _Only Round the Corner_, was produced at the Exeter\r\nTheatre, but within four years of his début as a dramatist he scored a\r\ngreat success by _The Silver King_ (November 1882), written with Henry\r\nHerman, a melodrama produced by Wilson Barrett at the Princess's\r\nTheatre. Its financial success enabled the author to write a play \"to\r\nplease himself.\" _Saints and Sinners_ (1884), which ran for two hundred\r\nnights, placed on the stage a picture of middle-class life and religion\r\nin a country town, and the introduction of the religious element raised\r\nconsiderable outcry. The author defended himself in an article published\r\nin the _Nineteenth Century_ (January 1885), taking for his\r\nstarting-point a quotation from the preface to Molière's _Tartuffe_. His\r\nnext serious piece was _The Middleman_ (1889), followed by _Judah_\r\n(1890), both powerful plays, which established his reputation. Later\r\nplays were _The Dancing Girl_ (1891), _The Crusaders_ (1891), _The\r\nBauble Shop_ (1893), _The Tempter_ (1893), _The Masqueraders_ (1894),\r\n_The Case of Rebellious Susan_ (1894), _The Triumph of the Philistines_\r\n(1895), _Michael and his Lost Angel_ (1896), _The Rogue's Comedy_\r\n(1896), _The Physician_ (1897), _The Liars_ (1897), _Carnac Sahib_\r\n(1899), _The Manoeuvres of Jane_ (1899), _The Lackeys' Carnival_ (1900),\r\n_Mrs Dane's Defence_ (1900), _The Princess's Nose_ (1902), _Chance the\r\nIdol_ (1902), _Whitewashing Julia_ (1903), _Joseph Entangled_ (1904),\r\n_The Chevalier_ (1904), &c. A uniform edition of his plays began to be\r\nissued in 1891; and his own views of dramatic art have been expressed\r\nfrom time to time in lectures and essays, collected in 1895 as _The\r\nRenascence of the English Drama_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJONES, INIGO (1573-1651), English architect, sometimes called the\r\n\"English Palladio,\" the son of a cloth-worker, was born in London on the\r\n15th of July 1573. It is stated that he was apprenticed to a joiner, but\r\nat any rate his talent for drawing attracted the attention of Thomas\r\nHoward, earl of Arundel (some say William, 3rd earl of Pembroke),\r\nthrough whose help he went to study landscape-painting in Italy. His\r\npreference soon transferred itself to architecture, and, following\r\nchiefly the style of Palladio, he acquired at Venice such a reputation\r\nthat in 1604 he was invited by Christian IV. to Denmark, where he is\r\nsaid to have designed the two great royal palaces of Rosenborg and\r\nFrederiksborg. In the following year he accompanied Anne of Denmark to\r\nthe court of James I. of England, where, besides being appointed\r\narchitect to the queen and Prince Henry, he was employed in supplying\r\nthe designs and decorations of the court masques. After a second visit\r\nto Italy in 1612, Jones was appointed surveyor-general of royal\r\nbuildings by James I., and was engaged to prepare designs for a new\r\npalace at Whitehall. In 1620 he was employed by the king to investigate\r\nthe origin of Stonehenge, when he came to the absurd conclusion that it\r\nhad been a Roman temple. Shortly afterwards he was appointed one of the\r\ncommissioners for the repair of St Paul's, but the work was not begun\r\ntill 1633. Under Charles I. he enjoyed the same offices as under his\r\npredecessor, and in the capacity of designer of the masques he came into\r\ncollision with Ben Jonson, who frequently made him the butt of his\r\nsatire. After the Civil War Jones was forced to pay heavy fines as a\r\ncourtier and malignant. He died in poverty on the 5th of July 1651.\r\n\r\n  A list of the principal buildings designed by Jones is given in\r\n  Dallaway's edition of Walpole's _Anecdotes of Painting_, and for an\r\n  estimate of him as an architect see Fergusson's _History of Modern\r\n  Architecture_. _The Architecture of Palladio_, in 4 books, by Inigo\r\n  Jones, appeared in 1715; _The Most Notable Antiquity of Great Britain,\r\n  called Stonehenge, restored by Inigo Jones_, in 1655 (ed. with memoir,\r\n  1725); the _Designs of Inigo Jones_, by W. Kent, in 1727; and _The\r\n  Designs of Inigo Jones_, by J. Ware, in 1757. See also G. H. Birch,\r\n  _London Churches of the XVIIth and XVIIIth Centuries_ (1896); W. J.\r\n  Loftie, _Inigo Jones and Wren, or the Rise and Decline of Modern\r\n  Architecture in England_ (1893).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJONES, JOHN (c. 1800-1882), English art collector, was born about 1800\r\nin or near London. He was apprenticed to a tailor, and about 1825 opened\r\na shop of his own in the west-end of London. In 1850 he was able to\r\nretire from active management with a large fortune. When quite a young\r\nman he had begun to collect articles of _vertu_. The rooms over his shop\r\nin which he at first lived were soon crowded, and even the bedrooms of\r\nhis new house in Piccadilly were filled with art treasures. His\r\ncollection was valued at approximately £250,000. Jones died in London on\r\nthe 7th of January 1882, leaving his pictures, furniture and objects of\r\nart to the South Kensington Museum.\r\n\r\n  A _Catalogue of the Jones Bequest_ was published by the Museum in\r\n  1882, and a _Handbook_, with memoir, in 1883.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJONES, JOHN PAUL (1747-1792), American naval officer, was born on the\r\n6th of July 1747, on the estate of Arbigland, in the parish of Kirkbean\r\nand the stewartry of Kirkcudbright, Scotland. His father, John Paul, was\r\ngardener to Robert Craik, a member of parliament; and his mother, Jean\r\nMacduff, was the daughter of a Highlander. Young John Paul, at the age\r\nof twelve, became shipmaster's apprentice to a merchant of Whitehaven,\r\nnamed Younger. At seventeen he shipped as second mate and in the next\r\nyear as first mate in one of his master's vessels; on being released\r\nfrom his indentures, he acquired an interest in a ship, and as first\r\nmate made two voyages between Jamaica and the Guinea coast, trading in\r\nslaves. Becoming dissatisfied with this kind of employment, he sold his\r\nshare in the ship and embarked for England. During the voyage both the\r\ncaptain and the mate died of fever, and John Paul took command and\r\nbrought the ship safely to port. The owners gave him and the crew 10% of\r\nthe cargo; after 1768, as captain of one of their merchantmen, John Paul\r\nmade several voyages to America; but for unknown reasons he suddenly\r\ngave up his command to live in America in poverty and obscurity until\r\n1775. During this period he assumed the name of Jones, apparently out of\r\nregard for Willie Jones, a wealthy planter and prominent political\r\nleader of North Carolina, who had befriended John Paul in his days of\r\npoverty.\r\n\r\nWhen war broke out between England and her American colonies, John Paul\r\nJones was commissioned as a first lieutenant by the Continental\r\nCongress, on the 22nd of December 1775. In 1776 he participated in the\r\nunsuccessful attack on the island of New Providence, and as commander\r\nfirst of the \"Providence\" and then of the \"Alfred\" he cruised between\r\nBermuda and Nova Scotia, inflicting much damage on British shipping and\r\nfisheries. On the 10th of October 1776 he was promoted captain. On the\r\n1st of November 1777 he sailed in the sloop-of-war \"Ranger\" for France\r\nwith despatches for the American commissioners, announcing the surrender\r\nof Burgoyne and asking that Jones should be supplied with a swift\r\nfrigate for harassing the coasts of England. Failing to secure a\r\nfrigate, Jones sailed from Brest in the \"Ranger\" on the 10th of April\r\n1778. A few days later he surprised the garrisons of the two forts\r\ncommanding the harbour of Whitehaven, a port with which he was familiar\r\nfrom boyhood, spiked the guns and made an unsuccessful attempt to fire\r\nthe shipping. Four days thereafter he encountered the British\r\nsloop-of-war \"Drake,\" a vessel slightly superior to his in fighting\r\ncapacity, and after an hour's engagement the British ship struck her\r\ncolours and was taken to Brest. By this exploit Jones became a great\r\nhero in the eyes of the French, just beginning a war with Great Britain.\r\nWith the rank of commodore he was now put at the head of a squadron of\r\nfive ships. His flagship, the \"Duras,\" a re-fitted East Indiaman, was\r\nre-named by him the \"Bonhomme Richard,\" as a compliment to Benjamin\r\nFranklin, whose _Poor Richard's Almanac_ was then popular in France. On\r\nthe 14th of August the five ships sailed from L'Orient, accompanied by\r\ntwo French privateers. Several of the French commanders under Jones\r\nproved insubordinate, and the privateers and three of the men-of-war\r\nsoon deserted him. With the others, however, he continued to take\r\nprizes, and even planned to attack the port of Leith, but was prevented\r\nby unfavourable winds. On the evening of the 23rd of September the three\r\nmen-of-war sighted two British men-of-war, the \"Serapis\" and the\r\n\"Countess of Scarbrough,\" off Flamborough Head. The \"Alliance,\"\r\ncommanded by Captain Landais, made off, leaving the \"Bonhomme Richard\"\r\nand the \"Pallas\" to engage the Englishmen. Jones engaged the greatly\r\nsuperior \"Serapis,\" and after a desperate battle of three and a half\r\nhours compelled the English ship to surrender. The \"Countess of\r\nScarbrough\" had meanwhile struck to the more formidable \"Pallas.\" Jones\r\ntransferred his men and supplies to the \"Serapis,\" and the next day the\r\n\"Bonhomme Richard\" sank.\r\n\r\nDuring the following year Jones spent much of his time in Paris. Louis\r\nXVI. gave him a gold-hilted sword and the royal order of military merit,\r\nand made him chevalier of France. Early in 1781 Jones returned to\r\nAmerica to secure a new command. Congress offered him the command of the\r\n\"America,\" a frigate then building, but the vessel was shortly\r\nafterwards given to France. In November 1783 he was sent to Paris as\r\nagent for the prizes captured in European waters under his own command,\r\nand although he gave much attention to social affairs and engaged in\r\nseveral private business enterprises, he was very successful in\r\ncollecting the prize money. Early in 1787 he returned to America and\r\nreceived a gold medal from Congress in recognition of his services.\r\n\r\nIn 1788 Jones entered the service of the empress Catherine of Russia,\r\navowing his intention, however, \"to preserve the condition of an\r\nAmerican citizen and officer.\" As a rear-admiral he took part in the\r\nnaval campaign in the Liman (an arm of the Black Sea, into which flow\r\nthe Bug and Dnieper rivers) against the Turks, but the jealous intrigues\r\nof Russian officers caused him to be recalled to St Petersburg for the\r\npretended purpose of being transferred to a command in the North Sea.\r\nHere he was compelled to remain in idleness, while rival officers\r\nplotted against him and even maliciously assailed his private character.\r\nIn August 1789 he left St Petersburg a bitterly disappointed man. In May\r\n1790 he arrived in Paris, where he remained in retirement during the\r\nrest of his life, although he made several efforts to re-enter the\r\nRussian service.\r\n\r\nUndue exertion and exposure had wasted his strength before he reached\r\nthe prime of life, and after an illness, in which he was attended by the\r\nqueen's physician, he died on the 18th of July 1792. His body was\r\ninterred in the St Louis cemetery for foreign Protestants, the funeral\r\nexpenses being paid from the private purse of Pierrot François\r\nSimmoneau, the king's commissary. In the confusion during the following\r\nyears the burial place of Paul Jones was forgotten; but in June 1899\r\nGeneral Horace Porter, American ambassador to France, began a systematic\r\nsearch for the body, and after excavations on the site of the old\r\nProtestant cemetery, now covered with houses, a leaden coffin was\r\ndiscovered, which contained the body in a remarkable state of\r\npreservation. In July 1905 a fleet of American war-ships carried the\r\nbody to Annapolis, where it now rests in one of the buildings of the\r\nnaval academy.\r\n\r\nJones was a seaman of great bravery and technical ability, but\r\nover-jealous of his reputation and inclined to be querulous and\r\nboastful. The charges by the English that he was a pirate were\r\nparticularly galling to him. Although of unprepossessing appearance, 5\r\nft. 7 in. in height and slightly round-shouldered, he was noted for his\r\npleasant manners and was welcomed into the most brilliant courts of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n  Romance has played with the memory of Paul Jones to such an extent\r\n  that few accounts of his life are correct. Of the early biographies\r\n  the best are Sherburne's (London, 1825), chiefly a collection of\r\n  Jones's correspondence; the _Janette-Taylor Collection_ (New York,\r\n  1830), containing numerous extracts from his letters and journals; and\r\n  the life by A. S. MacKenzie (2 vols., New York, 1846). In recent years\r\n  a number of new biographies have appeared, including A. C. Buell's (2\r\n  vols., 1900), the trustworthiness of which has been discredited, and\r\n  Hutchins Hapgood's in the Riverside Biographical Series (1901). The\r\n  life by Cyrus Townsend Brady in the \"Great Commanders Series\" (1900)\r\n  is perhaps the best.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJONES, MICHAEL (d. 1649), British soldier. His father was bishop of\r\nKillaloe in Ireland. At the outbreak of the English Civil War he was\r\nstudying law, but he soon took service in the army of the king in\r\nIreland. He was present with Ormonde's army in many of the expeditions\r\nand combats of the devastating Irish War, but upon the conclusion of the\r\n\"Irish Cessation\" (see ORMONDE, JAMES BUTLER, DUKE OF) he resolved to\r\nleave the king's service for that of the parliament, in which he soon\r\ndistinguished himself by his activity and skill. In the Welsh War, and\r\nespecially at the last great victory at Rowton Heath, Jones's cavalry\r\nwas always far superior to that of the Royalists, and in reward for his\r\nservices he was made governor of Chester when that city fell into the\r\nhands of the parliament. Soon afterwards Jones was sent again to the\r\nIrish War, in the capacity of commander-in-chief. He began his work by\r\nreorganizing the army in the neighbourhood of Dublin, and for some time\r\nhe carried on a desultory war of posts, necessarily more concerned for\r\nhis supplies than for a victory. But at Dungan Hill he obtained a\r\ncomplete success over the army of General Preston, and though the war\r\nwas by no means ended, Jones was able to hold a large tract of country\r\nfor the parliament. But on the execution of Charles I., the war entered\r\nupon a new phase, and garrison after garrison fell to Ormonde's\r\nRoyalists. Soon Jones was shut up in Dublin, and then followed a siege\r\nwhich was regarded both in England and Ireland with the most intense\r\ninterest. On the 2nd of August 1649 the Dublin garrison relieved itself\r\nby the brilliant action of Rathmines, in which the royal army was\r\npractically destroyed. A fortnight later Cromwell landed with heavy\r\nreinforcements from England. Jones, his lieutenant-general, took the\r\nfield; but on the 19th of December 1649 he died, worn out by the\r\nfatigues of the campaign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJONES, OWEN (1741-1814), Welsh antiquary, was born on the 3rd of\r\nSeptember 1741 at Llanvihangel Glyn y Myvyr in Denbighshire. In 1760 he\r\nentered the service of a London firm of furriers, to whose business he\r\nultimately succeeded. He had from boyhood studied Welsh literature, and\r\nlater devoted time and money to its collection. Assisted by Edward\r\nWilliam of Glamorgan (Iolo Morganwg) and Dr. Owen Pughe, he published,\r\nat a cost of more than £1000, the well-known _Myvyrian Archaiology of\r\nWales_ (1801-1807), a collection of pieces dating from the 6th to the\r\n14th century. The manuscripts which he had brought together are\r\ndeposited in the British Museum; the material not utilized in the\r\n_Myvyrian Archaiology_ amounts to 100 volumes, containing 16,000 pages\r\nof verse and 15,300 pages of prose. Jones was the founder of the\r\nGwyneddigion Society (1772) in London for the encouragement of Welsh\r\nstudies and literature; and he began in 1805 a miscellany--the\r\n_Greal_--of which only one volume appeared. An edition of the poems of\r\n_Davydd ab Gwilym_ was also issued at his expense. He died on the 26th\r\nof December 1814 at his business premises in Upper Thames Street,\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJONES, OWEN (1809-1874), British architect and art decorator, son of\r\nOwen Jones, a Welsh antiquary, was born in London. After an\r\napprenticeship of six years in an architect's office, he travelled for\r\nfour years in Italy, Greece, Turkey, Egypt and Spain, making a special\r\nstudy of the Alhambra. On his return to England in 1836 he busied\r\nhimself in his professional work. His forte was interior decoration, for\r\nwhich his formula was: \"Form without colour is like a body without a\r\nsoul.\" He was one of the superintendents of works for the Exhibition of\r\n1851 and was responsible for the general decoration of the Crystal\r\nPalace at Sydenham. Along with Digby Wyatt, Jones collected the casts of\r\nworks of art with which the palace was filled. He died in London on the\r\n19th of April 1874.\r\n\r\n  Owen Jones was described in the _Builder_ for 1874 as \"the most potent\r\n  apostle of colour that architectural England has had in these days.\"\r\n  His range of activity is to be traced in his works: _Plans, Elevations\r\n  and Details of the Alhambra_ (1835-1845), in which he was assisted by\r\n  MM. Goury and Gayangos; _Designs for Mosaic and Tesselated Pavements_\r\n  (1842); _Polychromatic Ornament of Italy_ (1845); _An Attempt to\r\n  Define the Principles which regulate the Employment of Colour in\r\n  Decorative Arts_ (1852); _Handbook to the Alhambra Court_ (1854);\r\n  _Grammar of Ornament_ (1856), a very important work; _One Thousand and\r\n  One Initial Letters_ (1864); _Seven Hundred and Two Monograms_ (1864);\r\n  and _Examples of Chinese Ornament_ (1867).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJONES, RICHARD (1790-1855), English economist, was born at Tunbridge\r\nWells. The son of a solicitor, he was intended for the legal profession,\r\nand was educated at Caius College, Cambridge. Owing to ill-health, he\r\nabandoned the idea of the law and took orders soon after leaving\r\nCambridge. For several years he held curacies in Sussex and Kent. In\r\n1833 he was appointed professor of political economy at King's College,\r\nLondon, resigning this post in 1835 to succeed T. R. Malthus in the\r\nchair of political economy and history at the East India College at\r\nHaileybury. He took an active part in the commutation of tithes in 1836\r\nand showed great ability as a tithe commissioner, an office which he\r\nfilled till 1851. He was for some time, also, a charity commissioner. He\r\ndied at Haileybury, shortly after he had resigned his professorship, on\r\nthe 26th of January 1855. In 1831 Jones published his _Essay on the\r\nDistribution of Wealth and on the Sources of Taxation_, his most\r\nimportant work. In it he showed himself a thorough-going critic of the\r\nRicardian system.\r\n\r\n  Jones's method is inductive; his conclusions are founded on a wide\r\n  observation of contemporary facts, aided by the study of history. The\r\n  world he professed to study was not an imaginary world, inhabited by\r\n  abstract \"economic men,\" but the real world with the different forms\r\n  which the ownership and cultivation of land, and, in general, the\r\n  conditions of production and distribution, assume at different times\r\n  and places. His recognition of such different systems of life in\r\n  communities occupying different stages in the progress of civilization\r\n  led to his proposal of what he called a \"political economy of\r\n  nations.\" This was a protest against the practice of taking the\r\n  exceptional state of facts which exists, and is indeed only partially\r\n  realized, in a small corner of our planet as representing the uniform\r\n  type of human societies, and ignoring the effects of the early history\r\n  and special development of each community as influencing its economic\r\n  phenomena. Jones is remarkable for his freedom from exaggeration and\r\n  one-sided statement; thus, whilst holding Malthus in, perhaps, undue\r\n  esteem, he declines to accept the proposition that an increase of the\r\n  means of subsistence is necessarily followed by an increase of\r\n  population; and he maintains what is undoubtedly true, that with the\r\n  growth of population, in all well-governed and prosperous states, the\r\n  command over food, instead of diminishing, increases.\r\n\r\n  A collected edition of Jones's works, with a preface by W. Whewell,\r\n  was published in 1859.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJONES, THOMAS RUPERT (1819-   ), English geologist and palaeontologist,\r\nwas born in London on the 1st of October 1819. While at a private school\r\nat Ilminster, his attention was attracted to geology by the fossils that\r\nare so abundant in the Lias quarries. In 1835 he was apprenticed to a\r\nsurgeon at Taunton, and he completed his apprenticeship in 1842 at\r\nNewbury in Berkshire. He was then engaged in practice mainly in London,\r\ntill in 1849 he was appointed assistant secretary to the Geological\r\nSociety of London. In 1862 he was made professor of geology at the Royal\r\nMilitary College, Sandhurst. Having devoted his especial attention to\r\nfossil microzoa, he now became the highest authority in England on the\r\nForaminifera and Entomostraca. He edited the 2nd edition of Mantell's\r\n_Medals of Creation_ (1854), the 3rd edition of Mantell's _Geological\r\nExcursions round the Isle of Wight_ (1854), and the 7th edition of\r\nMantell's _Wonders of Geology_ (1857); he also edited the 2nd edition of\r\nDixon's _Geology of Sussex_ (1878). He was elected F.R.S. in 1872 and\r\nwas awarded the Lyell medal by the Geological Society in 1890. For many\r\nyears he was specially interested in the geology of South Africa.\r\n\r\n  His publications include _A Monograph of the Entomostraca of the\r\n  Cretaceous Formation of England_ (Palaeontograph. Soc., 1849); _A\r\n  Monograph of the Tertiary Entomostraca of England_ (ibid. 1857); _A\r\n  Monograph of the Fossil Estheriae_ (ibid. 1862); _A Monograph of the\r\n  Foraminifera of the Crag_ (ibid. 1866, &c., with H. B. Brady); and\r\n  numerous articles in the _Annals and Magazine of Natural History_, the\r\n  _Geological Magazine_, the _Proceedings of the Geologists'\r\n  Association_, and other journals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJONES, WILLIAM (1726-1800), English divine, was born at Lowick, in\r\nNorthamptonshire on the 30th of July 1726. He was descended from an old\r\nWelsh family and one of his progenitors was Colonel John Jones,\r\nbrother-in-law of Cromwell. He was educated at Charterhouse School, and\r\nat University College, Oxford. There a kindred taste for music, as well\r\nas a similarity in regard to other points of character, led to his close\r\nintimacy with George Horne (q.v.), afterwards bishop of Norwich, whom he\r\ninduced to study Hutchinsonian doctrines. After obtaining his bachelor's\r\ndegree in 1749, Jones held various preferments. In 1777 he obtained the\r\nperpetual curacy of Nayland, Suffolk, and on Horne's appointment to\r\nNorwich became his chaplain, afterwards writing his life. His vicarage\r\nbecame the centre of a High Church coterie, and Jones himself was a link\r\nbetween the non-jurors and the Oxford movement. He could write\r\nintelligibly on abstruse topics. He died on the 6th of January 1800.\r\n\r\n  In 1756 Jones published his tractate _On the Catholic Doctrine of the\r\n  Trinity_, a statement of the doctrine from the Hutchinsonian point of\r\n  view, with a succinct and able summary of biblical proofs. This was\r\n  followed in 1762 by an _Essay on the First Principles of Natural\r\n  Philosophy_, in which he maintained the theories of Hutchinson in\r\n  opposition to those of Sir Isaac Newton, and in 1781 he dealt with the\r\n  same subject in _Physiological Disquisitions_. Jones was also the\r\n  originator of the _British Critic_ (May 1793). His collected works,\r\n  with a life by William Stevens, appeared in 1801, in 12 vols., and\r\n  were condensed into 6 vols. in 1810. A life of Jones, forming pt. 5 of\r\n  the _Biography of English Divines_, was published in 1849.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJONES, SIR WILLIAM (1746-1794), British Orientalist and jurist, was born\r\nin London on the 28th of September 1746. He distinguished himself at\r\nHarrow, and during his last three years there applied himself to the\r\nstudy of Oriental languages, teaching himself the rudiments of Arabic,\r\nand reading Hebrew with tolerable ease. In his vacations he improved his\r\nacquaintance with French and Italian. In 1764 Jones entered University\r\nCollege, Oxford, where he continued to study Oriental literature, and\r\nperfected himself in Persian and Arabic by the aid of a Syrian Mirza,\r\nwhom he had discovered and brought from London. He added to his\r\nknowledge of Hebrew and made considerable progress in Italian, Spanish\r\nand Portuguese. He began the study of Chinese, and made himself master\r\nof the radical characters of that language. During five years he partly\r\nsupported himself by acting as tutor to Lord Althorpe, afterwards the\r\nsecond Earl Spencer, and in 1766 he obtained a fellowship. Though but\r\ntwenty-two years of age, he was already becoming famous as an\r\nOrientalist, and when Christian VII. of Denmark visited England in 1768,\r\nbringing with him a life of Nadir Shah in Persian, Jones was requested\r\nto translate the MS. into French. The translation appeared in 1770, with\r\nan introduction containing a description of Asia and a short history of\r\nPersia. This was followed in the same year by a _Traité sur la poésie\r\norientale_, and by a French metrical translation of the odes of Hafiz.\r\nIn 1771 he published a _Dissertation sur la littérature orientale_,\r\ndefending Oxford scholars against the criticisms made by Anquetil Du\r\nPerron in the introduction to his translation of the _Zend-Avesta_. In\r\nthe same year appeared his _Grammar of the Persian Language_. In 1772\r\nJones published a volume of _Poems, Chiefly Translations from Asiatick\r\nLanguages, together with Two Essays on the Poetry of Eastern Nations and\r\non the Arts commonly called Imitative_, and in 1774 a treatise entitled\r\n_Poeseos Asiaticae commentatorium libri sex_, which definitely confirmed\r\nhis authority as an Oriental scholar.\r\n\r\nFinding that some more financially profitable occupation was necessary,\r\nJones devoted himself with his customary energy to the study of the law,\r\nand was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1774. He studied not\r\nmerely the technicalities, but the philosophy, of law, and within two\r\nyears had acquired so considerable a reputation that he was in 1776\r\nappointed commissioner in bankruptcy. Besides writing an _Essay on the\r\nLaw of Bailments_, which enjoyed a high reputation both in England and\r\nAmerica, Jones translated, in 1778, the speeches of Isaeus on the\r\nAthenian right of inheritance. In 1780 he was a parliamentary candidate\r\nfor the university of Oxford, but withdrew from the contest before the\r\nday of election, as he found he had no chance of success owing to his\r\nLiberal opinions, especially on the questions of the American War and of\r\nthe slave trade.\r\n\r\nIn 1783 was published his translation of the seven ancient Arabic poems\r\ncalled _Moallakât_. In the same year he was appointed judge of the\r\nsupreme court of judicature at Calcutta, then \"Fort William,\" and was\r\nknighted. Shortly after his arrival in India he founded, in January\r\n1784, the Bengal Asiatic Society, of which he remained president till\r\nhis death. Convinced as he was of the great importance of consulting the\r\nHindu legal authorities in the original, he at once began the study of\r\nSanskrit, and undertook, in 1788, the colossal task of compiling a\r\ndigest of Hindu and Mahommedan law. This he did not live to complete,\r\nbut he published the admirable beginnings of it in his _Institutes of\r\nHindu Law, or the Ordinances of Manu_ (1794); his _Mohammedan Law of\r\nSuccession to Property of Intestates_; and his _Mohammedan Law of\r\nInheritance_ (1792). In 1789 Jones had completed his translation of\r\nKalidasa's most famous drama, _Sakuntala_. He also translated the\r\ncollection of fables entitled the _Hitopadesa_, the _Gitagovinda_, and\r\nconsiderable portions of the Vedas, besides editing the text of\r\nKalidasa's poem _Ritusamhara_. He was a large contributor also to his\r\nsociety's volumes of _Asiatic Researches_.\r\n\r\nHis unremitting literary labours, together with his heavy judicial work,\r\ntold on his health after a ten years' residence in Bengal; and he died\r\nat Calcutta on the 27th of April 1794. An extraordinary linguist,\r\nknowing thirteen languages well, and having a moderate acquaintance with\r\ntwenty-eight others, his range of knowledge was enormous. As a pioneer\r\nin Sanskrit learning and as founder of the Asiatic Society he rendered\r\nthe language and literature of the ancient Hindus accessible to European\r\nscholars, and thus became the indirect cause of later achievements in\r\nthe field of Sanskrit and comparative philology. A monument to his\r\nmemory was erected by the East India Company in St Paul's, London, and a\r\nstatue in Calcutta.\r\n\r\n  See the _Memoir_ (1804) by Lord Teignmouth, published in the collected\r\n  edition of Sir W. Jones's works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJÖNKÖPING, a town of Sweden, capital of the district (_län_) of\r\nJönköping, 230 m. S.W. of Stockholm by rail. Pop. (1900), 23,143.

Two\r\nquarters of the town, Svenska Mad and Tyska Mad, recall the time when\r\nthe site was a marsh (_mad_), and buildings were constructed on piles.\r\nThe residential suburbs among the hills, especially Dunkehallar, are\r\nattractive and healthier than the town. The church of St Kristine (c.\r\n1650), the court-houses, town-hall, government buildings, and high\r\nschool, are noteworthy. The town is one of the leading industrial\r\ncentres in Sweden. The match manufacture, for which it is principally\r\nfamous, was founded by Johan Edvard Lundström in 1844. The well-known\r\nbrand of _säkerhets-tändstickor_ (safety-matches) was introduced later.\r\nThere are also textile manufactures, paper-factories (on Munksjö), and\r\nmechanical works. There is a large fire-arms factory at Huskvarna, 5 m.\r\nE. Water-power is supplied here by a fine series of falls. The hill\r\nTaberg, 8 m. S., is a mass of magnetic iron ore, rising 410 ft. above\r\nthe surrounding country, 2950 ft. long and 1475 ft. broad, but the\r\npercentage of iron is low as compared with the rich ores of other parts,\r\nand the deposit is little worked. Jönköping is the seat of one of the\r\nthree courts of appeal in Sweden.\r\n\r\nJönköping received the earliest extant Swedish charter in 1284 from\r\nMagnus I. The castle is mentioned in 1263, when Waldemar Birgersson\r\nmarried the Danish princess Sophia. Jönköping was afterwards the scene\r\nof many events of moment in Scandinavian history--of parliaments in\r\n1357, 1439, and 1599; of the meeting of the Danish and Swedish\r\nplenipotentiaries in 1448; and of the death of Sten Sture, the elder, in\r\n1503. In 1612 Gustavus Adolphus caused the inhabitants to destroy their\r\ntown lest it should fall into the hands of the Danes; but it was rebuilt\r\nsoon after, and in 1620 received special privileges from the king. At\r\nthis period a textile industry was started here, the first of any\r\nimportance in Sweden. It was from the Dutch and German workmen,\r\nintroduced at this time, that the quarter Tyska Mad received its name.\r\nOn the 10th of December 1809 the plenipotentiaries of Sweden and Denmark\r\nconcluded peace in the town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJONSON, BEN[1] (1573-1637), English dramatist, was born, probably in\r\nWestminster, in the beginning of the year 1573 (or possibly, if he\r\nreckoned by the unadopted modern calendar, 1572; see Castelain, p. 4,\r\nnote 1). By the poet's account his grandfather had been a gentleman who\r\n\"came from\" Carlisle, and originally, the grandson thought, from\r\nAnnandale. His arms, \"three spindles or rhombi,\" are the family device\r\nof the Johnstones of Annandale, a fact which confirms his assertion of\r\nBorder descent. Ben Jonson further related that he was born a month\r\nafter the death of his father, who, after suffering in estate and person\r\nunder Queen Mary, had in the end \"turned minister.\" Two years after the\r\nbirth of her son the widow married again; she may be supposed to have\r\nloved him in a passionate way peculiar to herself, since on one occasion\r\nwe find her revealing an almost ferocious determination to save his\r\nhonour at the cost of both his life and her own. Jonson's stepfather was\r\na master bricklayer, living in Hartshorn Lane, near Charing Cross, who\r\nprovided his stepson with the foundations of a good education. After\r\nattending a private school in St Martin's Lane, the boy was sent to\r\nWestminster School at the expense, it is said, of William Camden.\r\nJonson's gratitude for an education to which in truth he owed an almost\r\ninestimable debt concentrated itself upon the \"most reverend head\" of\r\nhis benefactor, then second and afterwards head master of the famous\r\nschool, and the firm friend of his pupil in later life.\r\n\r\nAfter reaching the highest form at Westminster, Jonson is stated, but on\r\nunsatisfactory evidence, to have proceeded to Cambridge--according to\r\nFuller, to St John's College. (For reasons in support of the tradition\r\nthat he was a member of St John's College, see J. B. Mullinger, the\r\n_Eagle_, No. xxv.) He says, however, himself that he studied at neither\r\nuniversity, but was put to a trade immediately on leaving school. He\r\nsoon had enough of the trade, which was no doubt his father's\r\nbricklaying, for Henslowe in writing to Edward Alleyne of his affair\r\nwith Gabriel Spenser calls him \"bergemen [_sic_] Jonson, bricklayer.\"\r\nEither before or after his marriage--more probably before, as Sir\r\nFrancis Vere's three English regiments were not removed from the Low\r\nCountries till 1592--he spent some time in that country soldiering, much\r\nto his own subsequent satisfaction when the days of self-conscious\r\nretrospect arrived, but to no further purpose beyond that of seeing\r\nsomething of the world.\r\n\r\nBen Jonson married not later than 1592. The registers of St Martin's\r\nChurch state that his eldest daughter Maria died in November 1593 when\r\nshe was, Jonson tells us (epigram 22), only six months old. His eldest\r\nson Benjamin died of the plague ten years later (epigram 45). (A\r\nyounger Benjamin died in 1635.) His wife Jonson characterized to\r\nDrummond as \"a shrew, but honest\"; and for a period (undated) of five\r\nyears he preferred to live without her, enjoying the hospitality of Lord\r\nAubigny (afterwards duke of Lennox). Long burnings of oil among his\r\nbooks, and long spells of recreation at the tavern, such as Jonson\r\nloved, are not the most favoured accompaniments of family life. But\r\nJonson was no stranger to the tenderest of affections: two at least of\r\nthe several children whom his wife bore to him he commemorated in\r\ntouching little tributes of verse; nor in speaking of his lost eldest\r\ndaughter did he forget \"her mother's tears.\" By the middle of 1597 we\r\ncome across further documentary evidence of him at home in London in the\r\nshape of an entry in Philip Henslowe's diary (July 28) of 3s. 6d.\r\n\"received of Bengemenes Johnsones share.\" He was therefore by this\r\ntime--when Shakespeare, his senior by nearly nine years, was already in\r\nprosperous circumstances and good esteem--at least a regular member of\r\nthe acting profession, with a fixed engagement in the lord admiral's\r\ncompany, then performing under Henslowe's management at the Rose.\r\nPerhaps he had previously acted at the Curtain (a former house of the\r\nlord admiral's men), and \"taken mad Jeronimo's part\" on a play-wagon in\r\nthe highway. This latter appearance, if it ever took place, would, as\r\nwas pointed out by Gifford, probably have been in Thomas Kyd's _Spanish\r\nTragedy_, since in _The First Part of Jeronimo_ Jonson would have had,\r\nmost inappropriately, to dwell on the \"smallness\" of his \"bulk.\" He was\r\nat a subsequent date (1601) employed by Henslowe to write up _The\r\nSpanish Tragedy_, and this fact may have given rise to Wood's story of\r\nhis performance as a stroller (see, however, Fleay, _The English Drama_,\r\nii. 29, 30). Jonson's additions, which were not the first changes made\r\nin the play, are usually supposed to be those printed with _The Spanish\r\nTragedy_ in the edition of 1602; Charles Lamb's doubts on the subject,\r\nwhich were shared by Coleridge, seem an instance of that subjective kind\r\nof criticism which it is unsafe to follow when the external evidence to\r\nthe contrary is so strong.\r\n\r\nAccording to Aubrey, whose statement must be taken for what it is worth,\r\n\"Jonson was never a good actor, but an excellent instructor.\" His\r\nphysique was certainly not well adapted to the histrionic conditions of\r\nhis--perhaps of any--day; but, in any case, it was not long before he\r\nfound his place in the organism of his company. In 1597, as we know from\r\nHenslowe, Jonson undertook to write a play for the lord admiral's men;\r\nand in the following year he was mentioned by Merès in his _Palladis\r\nTamia_ as one of \"the best for tragedy,\" without any reference to a\r\nconnexion on his part with the other branch of the drama. Whether this\r\nwas a criticism based on material evidence or an unconscious slip, Ben\r\nJonson in the same year 1598 produced one of the most famous of English\r\ncomedies, _Every Man in his Humour_, which was first acted--probably in\r\nthe earlier part of September--by the lord chamberlain's company at the\r\nCurtain. Shakespeare was one of the actors in Jonson's comedy, and it is\r\nin the character of Old Knowell in this very play that, according to a\r\nbold but ingenious guess, he is represented in the half-length portrait\r\nof him in the folio of 1623, beneath which were printed Jonson's lines\r\nconcerning the picture. _Every Man in his Humour_ was published in 1601;\r\nthe critical prologue first appears in the folio of 1616, and there are\r\nother divergences (see Castelain, appendix A). After the Restoration the\r\nplay was revived in 1751 by Garrick (who acted Kitely) with alterations,\r\nand long continued to be known on the stage. It was followed in the same\r\nyear by _The Case is Altered_, acted by the children of the queen's\r\nrevels, which contains a satirical attack upon the pageant poet, Anthony\r\nMunday. This comedy, which was not included in the folio editions, is\r\none of intrigue rather than of character; it contains obvious\r\nreminiscences of Shylock and his daughter. The earlier of these two\r\ncomedies was indisputably successful.\r\n\r\nBefore the year 1598 was out, however, Jonson found himself in prison\r\nand in danger of the gallows. In a duel, fought on the 22nd of September\r\nin Hogsden Fields, he had killed an actor of Henslowe's company named\r\nGabriel Spenser. The quarrel with Henslowe consequent on this event may\r\naccount for the production of _Every Man in his Humour_ by the rival\r\ncompany. In prison Jonson was visited by a Roman Catholic priest, and\r\nthe result (certainly strange, if Jonson's parentage is considered) was\r\nhis conversion to the Church of Rome, to which he adhered for twelve\r\nyears. Jonson was afterwards a diligent student of divinity; but, though\r\nhis mind was religious, it is not probable that its natural bias much\r\ninclined it to dwell upon creeds and their controversies. He pleaded\r\nguilty to the charge brought against him, as the rolls of Middlesex\r\nsessions show; but, after a short imprisonment, he was released by\r\nbenefit of clergy, forfeiting his \"goods and chattels,\" and being\r\nbranded on his left thumb. The affair does not seem to have affected his\r\nreputation; in 1599 he is found back again at work for Henslowe,\r\nreceiving together with Dekker, Chettle and \"another gentleman,\"\r\nearnest-money for a tragedy (undiscovered) called _Robert II., King of\r\nScots_. In the same year he brought out through the lord chamberlain's\r\ncompany (possibly already at the Globe, then newly built or building)\r\nthe elaborate comedy of _Every Man out of his Humour_ (quarto 1600; fol.\r\n1616)--a play subsequently presented before Queen Elizabeth. The\r\nsunshine of court favour, rarely diffused during her reign in rays\r\notherwise than figuratively golden, was not to bring any material\r\ncomfort to the most learned of her dramatists, before there was laid\r\nupon her the inevitable hand of which his courtly epilogue had besought\r\ndeath to forget the use. Indeed, of his _Cynthia's Revels_, performed by\r\nthe chapel children in 1600 and printed with the first title of _The\r\nFountain of Self-Love_ in 1601, though it was no doubt primarily\r\ndesigned as a compliment to the queen, the most marked result had been\r\nto offend two playwrights of note--Dekker, with whom he had formerly\r\nworked in company, and who had a healthy if rough grip of his own; and\r\nMarston, who was perhaps less dangerous by his strength than by his\r\nversatility. According to Jonson, his quarrel with Marston had begun by\r\nthe latter attacking his morals, and in the course of it they came to\r\nblows, and might have come to worse. In _Cynthia's Revels_, Dekker is\r\ngenerally held to be satirized as Hedon, and Marston as Anaides (Fleay,\r\nhowever, thinks Anaides is Dekker, and Hedon Daniel), while the\r\ncharacter of Crites most assuredly has some features of Jonson himself.\r\nLearning the intention of the two writers whom he had satirized, or at\r\nall events of Dekker, to wreak literary vengeance upon him, he\r\nanticipated them in _The Poetaster_ (1601), again played by the children\r\nof the queen's chapel at the Blackfriars and printed in 1602; Marston\r\nand Dekker are here ridiculed respectively as the aristocratic Crispinus\r\nand the vulgar Demetrius. The play was completed fifteen weeks after its\r\nplot was first conceived. It is not certain to what the proceedings\r\nagainst author and play before the lord chief justice, referred to in\r\nthe dedication of the edition of 1616, had reference, or when they were\r\ninstituted. Fleay's supposition that the \"purge,\" said in the _Returne\r\nfrom Parnassus_ (Pt. II. act iv. sc. iii.) to have been administered by\r\nShakespeare to Jonson in return for Horace's \"pill to the poets\" in this\r\npiece, consisted of _Troilus and Cressida_ is supremely ingenious, but\r\ncannot be examined here. As for Dekker, he retaliated on _The Poetaster_\r\nby the _Satiromastix, or The Untrussing of the Humorous Poet_ (1602).\r\nSome more last words were indeed attempted on Jonson's part, but in the\r\n_Apologetic Dialogue_ added to _The Poetaster_ in the edition of 1616,\r\nthough excluded from that of 1602, he says he intends to turn his\r\nattention to tragedy. This intention he apparently carried out\r\nimmediately, for in 1602 he received £10 from Henslowe for a play,\r\nentitled _Richard Crookbacke_, now lost--unfortunately so, for purposes\r\nof comparison in particular, even if it was only, as Fleay conjectures,\r\n\"an alteration of Marlowe's play.\" According to a statement by Overbury,\r\nearly in 1603, \"Ben Johnson, the poet, now lives upon one Townesend,\"\r\nsupposed to have been the poet and masque-writer Aurelian Townshend, at\r\none time steward to the 1st earl of Salisbury, \"and scornes the world.\"\r\nTo his other early patron, Lord Aubigny, Jonson dedicated the first of\r\nhis two extant tragedies, _Sejanus_, produced by the king's servants at\r\nthe Globe late in 1603, Shakespeare once more taking a part in the\r\nperformance. Either on its performance or on its appearing in print in\r\n1605, Jonson was called before the privy council by the Earl of\r\nNorthampton. But it is open to question whether this was the occasion on\r\nwhich, according to Jonson's statement to Drummond, Northampton \"accused\r\nhim both of popery and treason\" (see Castelain, Appendix C). Though, for\r\none reason or another, unsuccessful at first, the endurance of its\r\nreputation is attested by its performance, in a German version by an\r\nEnglishman, John Michael Girish, at the court of the grandson of James\r\nI. at Heidelberg.\r\n\r\nWhen the reign of James I. opened in England and an adulatory loyalty\r\nseemed intent on showing that it had not exhausted itself at the feet of\r\nGloriana, Jonson's well-stored brain and ready pen had their share in\r\ndevising and executing ingenious variations on the theme \"Welcome--since\r\nwe cannot do without thee!\" With extraordinary promptitude his genius,\r\nwhich, far from being \"ponderous\" in its operations, was singularly\r\nswift and flexible in adapting itself to the demands made upon it, met\r\nthe new taste for masques and entertainments--new of course in degree\r\nrather than in kind--introduced with the new reign and fostered by both\r\nthe king and his consort. The pageant which on the 7th of May 1603 bade\r\nthe king welcome to a capital dissolved in joy was partly of Jonson's,\r\npartly of Dekker's, devising; and he was able to deepen and diversify\r\nthe impression by the composition of masques presented to James I. when\r\nentertained at houses of the nobility. _The Satyr_ (1603) was produced\r\non one of these occasions, Queen Anne's sojourn at Althorpe, the seat of\r\nSir Robert Spencer, afterwards Lord Althorpe, who seems to have\r\npreviously bestowed some patronage upon him. _The Penates_ followed on\r\nMay-day 1604 at the house of Sir William Cornwallis at Highgate, and the\r\nqueen herself with her ladies played his _Masque of Blackness_ at\r\nWhitehall in 1605. He was soon occasionally employed by the court\r\nitself--already in 1606 in conjunction with Inigo Jones, as responsible\r\nfor the \"painting and carpentry\"--and thus speedily showed himself\r\nmaster in a species of composition for which, more than any other\r\nEnglish poet before Milton, he secured an enduring place in the national\r\npoetic literature. Personally, no doubt, he derived considerable\r\nmaterial benefit from the new fashion--more especially if his statement\r\nto Drummond was anything like correct, that out of his plays (which may\r\nbe presumed to mean his original plays) he had never gained a couple of\r\nhundred pounds.\r\n\r\nGood humour seems to have come back with good fortune. Joint employment\r\nin _The King's Entertainment_ (1604) had reconciled him with Dekker; and\r\nwith Marston also, who in 1604 dedicated to him his _Malcontent_, he was\r\nagain on pleasant terms. When, therefore, in 1604 Marston and Chapman\r\n(who, Jonson told Drummond, was loved of him, and whom he had probably\r\nhonoured as \"Virgil\" in _The Poetaster_, and who has, though on doubtful\r\ngrounds, been supposed to have collaborated in the original _Sejanus_)\r\nproduced the excellent comedy of _Eastward Ho_, it appears to have\r\ncontained some contributions by Jonson. At all events, when the authors\r\nwere arrested on account of one or more passages in the play which were\r\ndeemed insulting to the Scots, he \"voluntarily imprisoned himself\" with\r\nthem. They were soon released, and a banquet at his expense, attended by\r\nCamden and Selden, terminated the incident. If Jonson is to be believed,\r\nthere had been a report that the prisoners were to have their ears and\r\nnoses cut, and, with reference apparently to this peril, \"at the midst\r\nof the feast his old mother drank to him, and showed him a paper which\r\nshe had intended (if the sentence had taken execution) to have mixed in\r\nthe prison among his drink, which was full of lusty strong poison; and\r\nthat she was no churl, she told him, she minded first to have drunk of\r\nit herself.\" Strange to say, in 1605 Jonson and Chapman, though the\r\nformer, as he averred, had so \"attempered\" his style as to have \"given\r\nno cause to any good man of grief,\" were again in prison on account of\r\n\"a play\"; but they appear to have been once more speedily set free, in\r\nconsequence of a very manly and dignified letter addressed by Jonson to\r\nthe Earl of Salisbury. As to the relations between Chapman and Jonson,\r\nillustrated by newly discovered letters, see Bertram Dobell in the\r\n_Athenaeum_ No. 3831 (March 30, 1901), and the comments of Castelain.\r\nHe thinks that the play in question, in which both Chapman and Jonson\r\ntook part, was _Sir Gyles Goosecappe_, and that the last imprisonment of\r\nthe two poets was shortly after the discovery of the Gunpowder Plot. In\r\nthe mysterious history of the Gunpowder Plot Jonson certainly had some\r\nobscure part. On the 7th of November, very soon after the discovery of\r\nthe conspiracy, the council appears to have sent for him and to have\r\nasked him, as a loyal Roman Catholic, to use his good offices in\r\ninducing the priests to do something required by the council--one hardly\r\nlikes to conjecture it to have been some tampering with the secrets of\r\nconfession. In any case, the negotiations fell through, because the\r\npriests declined to come forth out of their hiding-places to be\r\nnegotiated with--greatly to the wrath of Ben Jonson, who declares in a\r\nletter to Lord Salisbury that \"they are all so enweaved in it that it\r\nwill make 500 gentlemen less of the religion within this week, if they\r\ncarry their understanding about them.\" Jonson himself, however, did not\r\ndeclare his separation from the Church of Rome for five years longer,\r\nhowever much it might have been to his advantage to do so.\r\n\r\nHis powers as a dramatist were at their height during the earlier half\r\nof the reign of James I.; and by the year 1616 he had produced nearly\r\nall the plays which are worthy of his genius. They include the tragedy\r\nof _Catiline_ (acted and printed 1611), which achieved only a doubtful\r\nsuccess, and the comedies of _Volpone, or the Fox_ (acted 1605 and\r\nprinted in 1607 with a dedication \"from my house in the Blackfriars\"),\r\n_Epicoene, or the Silent Woman_ (1609; entered in the Stationers'\r\nRegister 1610), the _Alchemist_ (1610; printed in 1610), _Bartholomew\r\nFair_ and _The Devil is an Ass_ (acted respectively in 1614 and 1616).\r\nDuring the same period he produced several masques, usually in connexion\r\nwith Inigo Jones, with whom, however, he seems to have quarrelled\r\nalready in this reign, though it is very doubtful whether the architect\r\nis really intended to be ridiculed in _Bartholomew Fair_ under the\r\ncharacter of Lanthorn Leatherhead. Littlewit, according to Fleay, is\r\nDaniel. Among the most attractive of his masques may be mentioned the\r\n_Masque of Blackness_ (1606), the Masque of Beauty (1608), and the\r\n_Masque of Queens_ (1609), described by Swinburne as \"the most splendid\r\nof all masques\" and as \"one of the typically splendid monuments or\r\ntrophies of English literature.\" In 1616 a modest pension of 100 marks a\r\nyear was conferred upon him; and possibly this sign of royal favour may\r\nhave encouraged him to the publication of the first volume of the folio\r\ncollected edition of his works (1616), though there are indications that\r\nhe had contemplated its production, an exceptional task for a playwright\r\nof his times to take in hand, as early as 1612.\r\n\r\nHe had other patrons more bountiful than the Crown, and for a brief\r\nspace of time (in 1613) had travelled to France as governor (without\r\napparently much moral authority) to the eldest son of Sir Walter\r\nRaleigh, then a state prisoner in the Tower, for whose society Jonson\r\nmay have gained a liking at the Mermaid Tavern in Cheapside, but for\r\nwhose personal character he, like so many of his contemporaries, seems\r\nto have had but small esteem. By the year 1616 Jonson seems to have made\r\nup his mind to cease writing for the stage, where neither his success\r\nnor his profits had equalled his merits and expectations. He continued\r\nto produce masques and entertainments when called upon; but he was\r\nattracted by many other literary pursuits, and had already accomplished\r\nenough to furnish plentiful materials for retrospective discourse over\r\npipe or cup. He was already entitled to lord it at the Mermaid, where\r\nhis quick antagonist in earlier wit-combats (if Fuller's famous\r\ndescription be authentic) no longer appeared even on a visit from his\r\ncomfortable retreat at Stratford. That on the other hand Ben carried his\r\nwicked town habits into Warwickshire, and there, together with Drayton,\r\nmade Shakespeare drink so hard with them as to bring upon himself the\r\nfatal fever which ended his days, is a scandal with which we may fairly\r\nrefuse to load Jonson's memory. That he had a share in the preparing for\r\nthe press of the first folio of Shakespeare, or in the composition of\r\nits preface, is of course a mere conjecture.\r\n\r\nIt was in the year 1618 that, like Dr Samuel Johnson a century and a\r\nhalf afterwards, Ben resolved to have a real holiday for once, and about\r\nmidsummer started for his ancestral country, Scotland. He had (very\r\nheroically for a man of his habits) determined to make the journey on\r\nfoot; and he was speedily followed by John Taylor, the water-poet, who\r\nstill further handicapped himself by the condition that he would\r\naccomplish the pilgrimage without a penny in his pocket. Jonson, who put\r\nmoney in his good friend's purse when he came up with him at Leith,\r\nspent more than a year and a half in the hospitable Lowlands, being\r\nsolemnly elected a burgess of Edinburgh, and on another occasion\r\nentertained at a public banquet there. But the best-remembered\r\nhospitality which he enjoyed was that of the learned Scottish poet,\r\nWilliam Drummond of Hawthornden, to which we owe the so-called\r\n_Conversations_. In these famous jottings, the work of no extenuating\r\nhand, Jonson lives for us to this day, delivering his censures, terse as\r\nthey are, in an expansive mood whether of praise or of blame; nor is he\r\nat all generously described in the postscript added by his fatigued and\r\nat times irritated host as \"a great lover and praiser of himself, a\r\ncontemner and scorner of others.\" A poetical account of this journey,\r\n\"with all the adventures,\" was burnt with Jonson's library.\r\n\r\nAfter his return to England Jonson appears to have resumed his former\r\ncourse of life. Among his noble patrons and patronesses were the\r\ncountess of Rutland (Sidney's daughter) and her cousin Lady Wroth; and\r\nin 1619 his visits to the country seats of the nobility were varied by a\r\nsojourn at Oxford with Richard Corbet, the poet, at Christ Church, on\r\nwhich occasion he took up the master's degree granted to him by the\r\nuniversity; whether he actually proceeded to the same degree granted to\r\nhim at Cambridge seems unknown. He confessed about this time that he was\r\nor seemed growing \"restive,\" i.e. lazy, though it was not long before he\r\nreturned to the occasional composition of masques. The extremely\r\nspirited _Gipsies Metamorphosed_ (1621) was thrice presented before the\r\nking, who was so pleased with it as to grant to the poet the reversion\r\nof the office of master of the revels, besides proposing to confer upon\r\nhim the honour of knighthood. This honour Jonson (hardly in deference to\r\nthe memory of Sir Petronel Flash) declined; but there was no reason why\r\nhe should not gratefully accept the increase of his pension in the same\r\nyear (1621) to £200--a temporary increase only, inasmuch as it still\r\nstood at 100 marks when afterwards augmented by Charles I.\r\n\r\nThe close of King James I.'s reign found the foremost of its poets in\r\nanything but a prosperous condition. It would be unjust to hold the Sun,\r\nthe Dog, the Triple Tun, or the Old Devil with its Apollo club-room,\r\nwhere Ben's supremacy must by this time have become established,\r\nresponsible for this result; taverns were the clubs of that day, and a\r\nman of letters is not considered lost in our own because he haunts a\r\nsmoking-room in Pall Mall. Disease had weakened the poet's strength, and\r\nthe burning of his library, as his _Execration upon Vulcan_ sufficiently\r\nshows, must have been no mere transitory trouble to a poor poet and\r\nscholar. Moreover he cannot but have felt, from the time of the\r\naccession of Charles I. early in 1625 onwards, that the royal patronage\r\nwould no longer be due in part to anything like intellectual sympathy.\r\nHe thus thought it best to recur to the surer way of writing for the\r\nstage, and in 1625 produced, with no faint heart, but with a very clear\r\nanticipation of the comments which would be made upon the reappearance\r\nof the \"huge, overgrown play-maker,\" _The Staple of News_, a comedy\r\nexcellent in some respects, but little calculated to become popular. It\r\nwas not printed till 1631. Jonson, whose habit of body was not more\r\nconducive than were his ways of life to a healthy old age, had a\r\nparalytic stroke in 1626, and a second in 1628. In the latter year, on\r\nthe death of Middleton, the appointment of city chronologer, with a\r\nsalary of 100 nobles a year, was bestowed upon him. He appears to have\r\nconsidered the duties of this office as purely ornamental; but in 1631\r\nhis salary was suspended until he should have presented some fruits of\r\nhis labours in his place, or--as he more succinctly phrased\r\nit--\"yesterday the barbarous court of aldermen have withdrawn their\r\nchandlerly pension for verjuice and mustard, £33, 6s. 8d.\" After being\r\nin 1628 arrested by mistake on the utterly false charge of having\r\nwritten certain verses in approval of the assassination of Buckingham,\r\nhe was soon allowed to return to Westminster, where it would appear from\r\na letter of his \"son and contiguous neighbour,\" James Howell, he was\r\nliving in 1629, and about this time narrowly escaped another\r\nconflagration. In the same year (1629) he once more essayed the stage\r\nwith the comedy of _The New Inn_, which was actually, and on its own\r\nmerits not unjustly, damned on the first performance. It was printed in\r\n1631, \"as it was never acted but most negligently played\"; and Jonson\r\ndefended himself against his critics in his spirited _Ode to Himself_.\r\nThe epilogue to _The New Inn_ having dwelt not without dignity upon the\r\nneglect which the poet had experienced at the hands of \"king and queen,\"\r\nKing Charles immediately sent the unlucky author a gift of £100, and in\r\nresponse to a further appeal increased his standing salary to the same\r\nsum, with the addition of an annual tierce of canary--the\r\npoet-laureate's customary royal gift, though this designation of an\r\noffice, of which Jonson discharged some of what became the ordinary\r\nfunctions, is not mentioned in the warrant dated the 26th of March 1630.\r\nIn 1634, by the king's desire, Jonson's salary as chronologer to the\r\ncity was again paid. To his later years belong the comedies, _The\r\nMagnetic Lady_ (1632) and _The Tale of a Tub_ (1633), both printed in\r\n1640, and some masques, none of which met with great success. The\r\npatronage of liberal-minded men, such as the earl, afterwards duke, of\r\nNewcastle--by whom he must have been commissioned to write his last two\r\nmasques _Love's Welcome at Welbeck_ (1633) and _Love's Welcome at\r\nBolsover_ (1634)--and Viscount Falkland, was not wanting, and his was\r\nhardly an instance in which the fickleness of time and taste could have\r\nallowed a literary veteran to end his career in neglect. He was the\r\nacknowledged chief of the English world of letters, both at the festive\r\nmeetings where he ruled the roast among the younger authors whose pride\r\nit was to be \"sealed of the tribe of Ben,\" and by the avowal of grave\r\nwriters, old or young, not one of whom would have ventured to dispute\r\nhis titular pre-eminence. Nor was he to the last unconscious of the\r\nclaims upon him which his position brought with it. When, nearly two\r\nyears after he had lost his surviving son, death came upon the sick old\r\nman on the 6th of August 1637, he left behind him an unfinished work of\r\ngreat beauty, the pastoral drama of _The Sad Shepherd_ (printed in\r\n1641). For forty years, he said in the prologue, he had feasted the\r\npublic; at first he could scarce hit its taste, but patience had at last\r\nenabled it to identify itself with the working of his pen.\r\n\r\nWe are so accustomed to think of Ben Jonson presiding, attentive to his\r\nown applause, over a circle of younger followers and admirers that we\r\nare apt to forget the hard struggle which he had passed through before\r\ngaining the crown now universally acknowledged to be his. Howell\r\nrecords, in the year before Ben's death, that a solemn supper at the\r\npoet's own house, where the host had almost spoiled the relish of the\r\nfeast by vilifying others and magnifying himself, \"T. Ca.\" (Thomas\r\nCarew) buzzed in the writer's ear \"that, though Ben had barrelled up a\r\ngreat deal of knowledge, yet it seemed he had not read the _Ethics_,\r\nwhich, among other precepts of morality, forbid self-commendation.\"\r\nSelf-reliance is but too frequently coupled with self-consciousness, and\r\nfor good and for evil self-confidence was no doubt the most prominent\r\nfeature in the character of Ben Jonson. Hence the combativeness which\r\ninvolved him in so many quarrels in his earlier days, and which jarred\r\nso harshly upon the less militant and in some respects more pedantic\r\nnature of Drummond. But his quarrels do not appear to have entered\r\ndeeply into his soul, or indeed usually to have lasted long.[2] He was\r\ntoo exuberant in his vituperations to be bitter, and too outspoken to be\r\nmalicious. He loved of all things to be called \"honest,\" and there is\r\nevery reason to suppose that he deserved the epithet. The old\r\nsuperstition that Jonson was filled with malignant envy of the greatest\r\nof his fellow-dramatists, and lost no opportunity of giving expression\r\nto it, hardly needs notice. Those who consider that Shakespeare was\r\nbeyond criticism may find blasphemy in the saying of Jonson that\r\nShakespeare \"wanted art.\" Occasional jesting allusions to particular\r\nplays of Shakespeare may be found in Jonson, among which should hardly\r\nbe included the sneer at \"mouldy\" Pericles in his _Ode to Himself_. But\r\nthese amount to nothing collectively, and to very little individually;\r\nand against them have to be set, not only the many pleasant traditions\r\nconcerning the long intimacy between the pair, but also the lines,\r\nprefixed to the first Shakespeare folio, as noble as they are judicious,\r\ndedicated by the survivor to \"the star of poets,\" and the adaptation,\r\nclearly sympathetic notwithstanding all its buts, _de Shakespeare\r\nnostrat_. in the _Discoveries_. But if Gifford had rendered no other\r\nservice to Jonson's fame he must be allowed to have once for all\r\nvindicated it from the cruellest aspersion which has ever been cast upon\r\nit. That in general Ben Jonson was a man of strong likes and dislikes,\r\nand was wont to manifest the latter as vehemently as the former, it\r\nwould be idle to deny. He was at least impartial in his censures,\r\ndealing them out freely to Puritan poets like Wither and (supposing him\r\nnot to have exaggerated his free-spokenness) to princes of his church\r\nlike Cardinal du Perron. And, if sensitive to attack, he seems to have\r\nbeen impervious to flattery--to judge from the candour with which he\r\ncondemned the foibles even of so enthusiastic an admirer as Beaumont.\r\nThe personage that he disliked the most, and openly abused in the\r\nroundest terms, was unfortunately one with many heads and a tongue to\r\nhiss in each--no other than that \"general public\" which it was the\r\nfundamental mistake of his life to fancy he could \"rail into\r\napprobation\" before he had effectively secured its goodwill. And upon\r\nthe whole it may be said that the admiration of the few, rather than the\r\nfavour of the many, has kept green the fame of the most independent\r\namong all the masters of an art which, in more senses than one, must\r\nplease to live.\r\n\r\nJonson's learning and industry, which were alike exceptional, by no\r\nmeans exhausted themselves in furnishing and elaborating the materials\r\nof his dramatic works. His enemies sneered at him as a translator--a\r\ntitle which the preceding generation was inclined to esteem the most\r\nhonourable in literature. But his classical scholarship shows itself in\r\nother directions besides his translations from the Latin poets (the _Ars\r\npoetica_ in particular), in addition to which he appears to have written\r\na version of Barclay's _Argenis_; it was likewise the basis of his\r\n_English Grammar_, of which nothing but the rough draft remains (the MS.\r\nitself having perished in the fire in his library), and in connexion\r\nwith the subject of which he appears to have pursued other linguistic\r\nstudies (Howell in 1629 was trying to procure him a Welsh grammar). And\r\nits effects are very visible in some of the most pleasing of his\r\nnon-dramatic poems, which often display that combination of polish and\r\nsimplicity hardly to be reached--or even to be appreciated--without some\r\nmeasure of classical training.\r\n\r\nExclusively of the few lyrics in Jonson's dramas (which, with the\r\nexception of the stately choruses in _Catiline_, charm, and perhaps may\r\nsurprise, by their lightness of touch), his non-dramatic works are\r\ncomprised in the following collections. The book of _Epigrams_\r\n(published in the first folio of 1616) contained, in the poet's own\r\nwords, the \"ripest of his studies.\" His notion of an epigram was the\r\nancient, not the restricted modern one--still less that of the critic\r\n(R. C., the author of _The Times' Whistle_) in whose language, according\r\nto Jonson, \"witty\" was \"obscene.\" On the whole, these epigrams excel\r\nmore in encomiastic than in satiric touches, while the pathos of one or\r\ntwo epitaphs in the collection is of the truest kind. In the lyrics and\r\nepistles contained in the _Forest_ (also in the first folio), Jonson\r\nshows greater variety in the poetic styles adopted by him; but the\r\nsubject of love, which Dryden considered conspicuous by its absence in\r\nthe author's dramas, is similarly eschewed here. The _Underwoods_ (not\r\npublished collectively till the second and surreptitious folio) are a\r\nmiscellaneous series, comprising, together with a few religious and a\r\nfew amatory poems, a large number of epigrams, epitaphs, elegies and\r\n\"odes,\" including both the tributes to Shakespeare and several to royal\r\nand other patrons and friends, besides the _Execration upon Vulcan_, and\r\nthe characteristic ode addressed by the poet to himself. To these pieces\r\nin verse should be added the _Discoveries--Timber, or Discoveries made\r\nupon Men and Matters_, avowedly a commonplace book of aphorisms noted by\r\nthe poet in his dally readings--thoughts adopted and adapted in more\r\ntranquil and perhaps more sober moods than those which gave rise to the\r\noutpourings of the _Conversations at Hawthornden_. As to the critical\r\nvalue of these _Conversations_ it is far from being only negative; he\r\nknew how to admire as well as how to disdain. For these thoughts, though\r\nabounding with biographical as well as general interest, Jonson was\r\nalmost entirely indebted to ancient writers, or (as has been shown by\r\nProfessor Spingarn and by Percy Simpson) indebted to the humanists of\r\nthe Renaissance (see _Modern Language Review_, ii. 3, April 1907).\r\n\r\nThe extant dramatic works of Ben Jonson fall into three or, if his\r\nfragmentary pastoral drama be considered to stand by itself, into four\r\ndistinct divisions. The tragedies are only two in number--_Sejanus his\r\nFall and Catiline his Conspiracy_.[3] Of these the earlier, as is worth\r\nnoting, was produced at Shakespeare's theatre, in all probability before\r\nthe first of Shakespeare's Roman dramas, and still contains a\r\nconsiderable admixture of rhyme in the dialogue. Though perhaps less\r\ncarefully elaborated in diction than its successor, _Sejanus_ is at\r\nleast equally impressive as a highly wrought dramatic treatment of a\r\ncomplex historic theme. The character of Tiberius adds an element of\r\ncurious psychological interest on which speculation has never quite\r\nexhausted itself and which, in Jonson's day at least, was wanting to the\r\nfigures of _Catiline_ and his associates. But in both plays the action\r\nis powerfully conducted, and the care bestowed by the dramatist upon the\r\ngreat variety of characters introduced cannot, as in some of his\r\ncomedies, be said to distract the interest of the reader. Both these\r\ntragedies are noble works, though the relative popularity of the subject\r\n(for conspiracies are in the long run more interesting than camarillas)\r\nhas perhaps secured the preference to Catiline. Yet this play and its\r\npredecessor were alike too manifestly intended by their author to court\r\nthe goodwill of what he calls the \"extraordinary\" reader. It is\r\ndifficult to imagine that (with the aid of judicious shortenings) either\r\ncould altogether miss its effect on the stage; but, while Shakespeare\r\ncauses us to forget, Jonson seems to wish us to remember, his\r\nauthorities. The half is often greater than the whole; and Jonson, like\r\nall dramatists and, it might be added, all novelists in similar cases,\r\nhas had to pay the penalty incurred by too obvious a desire to underline\r\nthe learning of the author.\r\n\r\nPerversity--or would-be originality--alone could declare Jonson's\r\ntragedy preferable to his comedy. Even if the revolution which he\r\ncreated in the comic branch of the drama had been mistaken in its\r\nprinciples or unsatisfactory in its results, it would be clear that the\r\nstrength of his dramatic genius lay in the power of depicting a great\r\nvariety of characters, and that in comedy alone he succeeded in finding\r\na wide field for the exercise of this power. There may have been no very\r\noriginal or very profound discovery in the idea which he illustrated in\r\n_Every Man in his Humour_, and, as it were, technically elaborated in\r\n_Every Man out of his Humour_--that in many men one quality is\r\nobservable which so possesses them as to draw the whole of their\r\nindividualities one way, and that this phenomenon \"may be truly said to\r\nbe a humour.\" The idea of the master quality or tendency was, as has\r\nbeen well observed, a very considerable one for dramatist or novelist.\r\nNor did Jonson (happily) attempt to work out this idea with any\r\nexcessive scientific consistency as a comic dramatist. But, by refusing\r\nto apply the term \"humour\" (q.v.) to a mere peculiarity or affectation\r\nof manners, and restricting its use to actual or implied differences or\r\ndistinctions of character, he broadened the whole basis of English\r\ncomedy after his fashion, as Molière at a later date, keeping in closer\r\ntouch with the common experience of human life, with a lighter hand\r\nbroadened the basis of French and of modern Western comedy at large. It\r\ndoes not of course follow that Jonson's disciples, the Bromes and the\r\nCartwrights, always adequately reproduced the master's conception of\r\n\"humorous\" comedy. Jonson's wide and various reading helped him to\r\ndiversify the application of his theory, while perhaps at times it led\r\nhim into too remote illustrations of it. Still, Captain Bobadil and\r\nCaptain Tucca, Macilente and Fungoso, Volpone and Mosca, and a goodly\r\nnumber of other characters impress themselves permanently upon the\r\nmemory of those whose attention they have as a matter of course\r\ncommanded. It is a very futile criticism to condemn Jonson's characters\r\nas a mere series of types of general ideas; on the other hand, it is a\r\nvery sound criticism to object, with Barry Cornwall, to the \"multitude\r\nof characters who throw no light upon the story, and lend no interest to\r\nit, occupying space that had better have been bestowed upon the\r\nprincipal agents of the plot.\"\r\n\r\nIn the construction of plots, as in most other respects, Jonson's at\r\nonce conscientious and vigorous mind led him in the direction of\r\noriginality; he depended to a far less degree than the greater part of\r\nhis contemporaries (Shakespeare with the rest) upon borrowed plots. But\r\neither his inventive character was occasionally at fault in this\r\nrespect, or his devotion to his characters often diverted his attention\r\nfrom a brisk conduct of his plot. Barry Cornwall has directed attention\r\nto the essential likeness in the plot of two of Jonson's best comedies,\r\n_Volpone_ and _The Alchemist_; and another critic, W. Bodham Donne, has\r\ndwelt on the difficulty which, in _The Poetaster_ and elsewhere, Ben\r\nJonson seems to experience in sustaining the promise of his actions.\r\n_The Poetaster_ is, however, a play _sui generis_, in which the real\r\nbusiness can hardly be said to begin till the last act.\r\n\r\nDryden, when criticizing Ben Jonson's comedies, thought fit, while\r\nallowing the old master humour and incontestable \"pleasantness,\" to deny\r\nhim wit and those ornaments thereof which Quintilian reckons up under\r\nthe terms _urbana_, _salsa_, _faceta_ and so forth. Such wit as Dryden\r\nhas in view is the mere outward fashion or style of the day, the\r\neuphuism or \"sheerwit\" or _chic_ which is the creed of Fastidious Brisks\r\nand of their astute purveyors at any given moment. In this Ben Jonson\r\nwas no doubt defective; but it would be an error to suppose him, as a\r\ncomic dramatist, to have maintained towards the world around him the\r\nattitude of a philosopher, careless of mere transient externalisms. It\r\nis said that the scene of his _Every Man in his Humour_ was originally\r\nlaid near Florence; and his _Volpone_, which is perhaps the darkest\r\nsocial picture ever drawn by him, plays at Venice. Neither locality was\r\nill-chosen, but the real atmosphere of his comedies is that of the\r\nnative surroundings amidst which they were produced; and Ben Jonson's\r\ntimes live for us in his men and women, his country gulls and town\r\ngulls, his alchemists and exorcists, his \"skeldring\" captains and\r\nwhining Puritans, and the whole ragamuffin rout of his _Bartholomew\r\nFair_, the comedy _par excellence_ of Elizabethan low life. After he had\r\ndescribed the pastimes, fashionable and unfashionable, of his age, its\r\nfeeble superstitions and its flaunting naughtinesses, its vapouring\r\naffectations and its lying effronteries, with an odour as of \"divine\r\ntabacco\" pervading the whole, little might seem to be left to describe\r\nfor his \"sons\" and successors. Enough, however, remained; only that his\r\nfollowers speedily again threw manners and \"humours\" into an\r\nundistinguishable medley.\r\n\r\nThe gift which both in his art and in his life Jonson lacked was that of\r\nexercising the influence or creating the effects which he wished to\r\nexercise or create without the appearance of consciousness. Concealment\r\nnever crept over his efforts, and he scorned insinuation. Instead of\r\nthis, influenced no doubt by the example of the free relations between\r\nauthor and public permitted by Attic comedy, he resorted again and\r\nagain, from _Every Man out of his Humour_ to _The Magnetic Lady_, to\r\ninductions and commentatory intermezzos and appendices, which, though\r\noccasionally effective by the excellence of their execution, are to be\r\nregretted as introducing into his dramas an exotic and often vexatious\r\nelement. A man of letters to the very core, he never quite understood\r\nthat there is and ought to be a wide difference of methods between the\r\nworld of letters and the world of the theatre.\r\n\r\nThe richness and versatility of Jonson's genius will never be fully\r\nappreciated by those who fail to acquaint themselves with what is\r\npreserved to us of his \"masques\" and cognate entertainments. He was\r\nconscious enough of his success in this direction--\"next himself,\" he\r\nsaid, \"only Fletcher and Chapman could write a masque.\" He introduced,\r\nor at least established, the ingenious innovation of the anti-masque,\r\nwhich Schlegel has described, as a species of \"parody added by the poet\r\nto his device, and usually prefixed to the serious entry,\" and which\r\naccordingly supplies a grotesque antidote to the often extravagantly\r\nimaginative main conception. Jonson's learning, creative power and\r\nhumorous ingenuity--combined, it should not be forgotten, with a genuine\r\nlyrical gift--all found abundant opportunities for displaying themselves\r\nin these productions. Though a growth of foreign origin, the masque was\r\nby him thoroughly domesticated in the high places of English literature.\r\nHe lived long enough to see the species produce its poetic masterpiece\r\nin Comus.\r\n\r\n_The Sad Shepherd_, of which Jonson left behind him three acts and a\r\nprologue, is distinguished among English pastoral dramas by its\r\nfreshness of tone; it breathes something of the spirit of the greenwood,\r\nand is not unnatural even in its supernatural element. While this piece,\r\nwith its charming love-scenes between Robin Hood and Maid Marion,\r\nremains a fragment, another pastoral by Jonson, the _May Lord_ (which F.\r\nG. Fleay and J. A. Symonds sought to identify with _The Sad Shepherd_;\r\nsee, however, W. W. Greg in introduction to the Louvain reprint), has\r\nbeen lost, and a third, of which Loch Lomond was intended to be the\r\nscene, probably remained unwritten.\r\n\r\nThough Ben Jonson never altogether recognized the truth of the maxim\r\nthat the dramatic art has properly speaking no didactic purpose, his\r\nlong and laborious life was not wasted upon a barren endeavour. In\r\ntragedy he added two works of uncommon merit to our dramatic literature.\r\nIn comedy his aim was higher, his effort more sustained, and his success\r\nmore solid than were those of any of his fellows. In the subsidiary and\r\nhybrid species of the masque, he helped to open a new and attractive\r\nthough undoubtedly devious path in the field of dramatic literature. His\r\nintellectual endowments surpassed those of most of the great English\r\ndramatists in richness and breadth; and in energy of application he\r\nprobably left them all behind. Inferior to more than one of his\r\nfellow-dramatists in the power of imaginative sympathy, he was first\r\namong the Elizabethans in the power of observation; and there is point\r\nin Barrett Wendell's paradox, that as a dramatist he was not really a\r\npoet but a painter. Yet it is less by these gifts, or even by his\r\nunexcelled capacity for hard work, than by the true ring of manliness\r\nthat he will always remain distinguished among his peers.\r\n\r\nJonson was buried on the north side of the nave in Westminster Abbey,\r\nand the inscription, \"O Rare Ben Jonson,\" was cut in the slab over his\r\ngrave. In the beginning of the 18th century a portrait bust was put up\r\nto his memory in the Poets' Corner by Harley, earl of Oxford. Of\r\nHonthorst's portrait of Jonson at Knole Park there is a copy in the\r\nNational Portrait Gallery; another was engraved by W. Marshall for the\r\n1640 edition of his Poems.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--The date of the first folio volume of Jonson's _Works_\r\n  (of which title his novel but characteristic use in applying it to\r\n  plays was at the time much ridiculed) has already been mentioned as\r\n  1616; the second, professedly published in 1640, is described by\r\n  Gifford as \"a wretched continuation of the first, printed from MSS.\r\n  surreptitiously obtained during his life, or ignorantly hurried\r\n  through the press after his death, and bearing a variety of dates from\r\n  1631 to 1641 inclusive.\" The works were reprinted in a single folio\r\n  volume in 1692, in which _The New Inn_ and _The Case is Altered_ were\r\n  included for the first time, and again in 6 vols. 8vo in 1715. Peter\r\n  Whalley's edition in 7 vols., with a life, appeared in 1756, but was\r\n  superseded in 1816 by William Gifford's, in 9 vols. (of which the\r\n  first includes a biographical memoir, and the famous essay on the\r\n  \"Proofs of Ben Jonson's Malignity, from the Commentators on\r\n  Shakespeare\"). A new edition of Gifford's was published in 9 vols. in\r\n  1875 by Colonel F. Cunningham, as well as a cheap reprint in 3 vols.\r\n  in 1870. Both contain the _Conversations_ with Drummond, which were\r\n  first printed in full by David Laing in the _Shakespeare Society's\r\n  Publications_ (1842) and the _Jonsonus Virbius_, a collection\r\n  (unparalleled in number and variety of authors) of poetical tributes,\r\n  published about six months after Jonson's death by his friends and\r\n  admirers. There is also a single-volume edition, with a very readable\r\n  memoir, by Barry Cornwall (1838). An edition of Ben Jonson's works\r\n  from the original texts was recently undertaken by C. H. Herford and\r\n  Percy Simpson. A selection from his plays, edited for the \"Mermaid\"\r\n  series in 1893-1895 by B. Nicholson, with an introduction by C. H.\r\n  Herford, was reissued in 1904. W. W. Bang in his _Materialien zur\r\n  Kunde des alten englischen Dramas_ has reprinted from the folio of\r\n  1616 those of Ben Jonson's plays which are contained in it (Louvain,\r\n  1905-1906). _Every Man in his Humour_ and _Every Man out of his\r\n  Humour_ have been edited for the same series (16 and 17, 1905 and\r\n  1907) by W. W. Bang and W. W. Greg. _Every Man in his Humour_ has also\r\n  been edited, with a brief biographical as well as special\r\n  introduction, to which the present sketch owes some details, by H. B.\r\n  Wheatley (1877). Some valuable editions of plays by Ben Jonson have\r\n  been recently published by American scholars in the _Yale Studies in\r\n  English_, edited by A. S. Cook--_The Poetaster_, ed. H. S. Mallory\r\n  (1905); _The Alchemist_, ed. C. M. Hathaway (1903); _The Devil is an\r\n  Ass_, ed. W. S. Johnson (1905); _The Staple of News_, ed. De Winter\r\n  (1905); _The New Inn_, ed. by G. Bremner (1908); _The Sad Shepherd_\r\n  (with Waldron's continuation) has been edited by W. W. Greg for Bang's\r\n  _Materialien zur Kunde des alten englischen Dramas_ (Louvain, 1905).\r\n\r\n  The criticisms of Ben Jonson are too numerous for cataloguing here;\r\n  among those by eminent Englishmen should be specially mentioned John\r\n  Dryden's, particularly those in his _Essay on Dramatic Poësy_\r\n  (1667-1668; revised 1684), and in the preface to _An Evening's Love,\r\n  or the Mock Astrologer_ (1668), and A. C. Swinburne's _Study of Ben\r\n  Jonson_ (1889), in which, however, the significance of the\r\n  _Discoveries_ is misapprehended. See also F. G.

S. of Kansas City. Pop. (1890), 9943; (1900), 26,023, of\r\nwhom 893 were foreign-born and 773 were negroes; (1910 census) 32,073.\r\nIt is served by the Missouri Pacific, the St Louis & San Francisco, the\r\nMissouri, Kansas & Texas, and the Kansas City Southern railways, and by\r\ninterurban electric lines. The city has a fine court-house, a United\r\nStates government building, a Carnegie library and a large auditorium.\r\nJoplin is the trade centre of a rich agricultural and fruit-growing\r\ndistrict, but its growth has been chiefly due to its situation in one of\r\nthe most productive zinc and lead regions in the country, for which it\r\nis the commercial centre. In 1906 the value of zinc-ore shipments from\r\nthis Missouri-Kansas (or Joplin) district was $12,074,105, and of\r\nshipments of lead ore, $3,048,558. The value of Joplin's factory product\r\nin 1905 was $3,006,203, an increase of 29.3% since 1900. Natural gas,\r\npiped from the Kansas fields, is used for light and power, and\r\nelectricity for commercial lighting and power is derived from plants on\r\nSpring River, near Vark, Kansas, and on Shoal creek. The municipality\r\nowns its electric-lighting plant; the water-works are under private\r\nownership. The first settlement in the neighbourhood was made in 1838.\r\nIn 1871 Joplin was laid out and incorporated as a town; in 1872 it and a\r\nrival town on the other side of Joplin creek were united under the name\r\nUnion City; in 1873 Union City was chartered as a city under the name\r\nJoplin; and in 1888 Joplin was chartered as a city of the third class.\r\nThe city derives its name from the creek, which was named in honour of\r\nthe Rev. Harris G. Joplin (c. 1810-1847), a native of Tennessee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOPPA, less correctly JAFFA (Arab. _Yafa_), a seaport on the coast of\r\nPalestine. It is of great antiquity, being mentioned in the tribute\r\nlists of Tethmosis (Thothmes) III.; but as it never was in the territory\r\nof the pre-exilic Israelites it was to them a place of no importance.\r\nIts ascription to the tribe of Dan (Josh. xix. 46) is purely\r\ntheoretical. According to the authors of Chronicles (2 Chron. ii. 16),\r\nEzra (iii. 7) and Jonah (i. 3) it was a seaport for importation of the\r\nLebanon timber floated down the coasts or for ships plying even to\r\ndistant Tarshish. About 148 B.C. it was captured from the Syrians by\r\nJonathan Maccabaeus (1 Macc. x. 75) and later it was retaken and\r\ngarrisoned by Simon his brother (xii. 33, xiii. 11). It was restored to\r\nthe Syrians by Pompey (Jos., _Ant._ xiv. 4, 4) but again given back to\r\nthe Jews (ib. xiv. 10, 6) with an exemption from tax. St Peter for a\r\nwhile lodged at Joppa, where he restored the benevolent widow Tabitha to\r\nlife, and had the vision which taught him the universality of the plan\r\nof Christianity.\r\n\r\nAccording to Strabo (xvi. ii.), who makes the strange mistake of saying\r\nthat Jerusalem is visible from Joppa, the place was a resort of pirates.\r\nIt was destroyed by Vespasian in the Jewish War (68). Tradition connects\r\nthe story of Andromeda and the sea-monster with the sea-coast of Joppa,\r\nand in early times her chains were shown as well as the skeleton of the\r\nmonster itself (Jos. _Wars_, iii. 9, 3). The site seems to have been\r\nshown even to some medieval pilgrims, and curious traces of it have been\r\ndetected in modern Moslem legends.\r\n\r\nIn the 5th and 11th centuries we hear from time to time of bishops of\r\nJoppa, under the metropolitan of Jerusalem. In 1126 the district was\r\ncaptured by the knights of St John, but lost to Saladin in 1187. Richard\r\nCoeur de Lion retook it in 1191, but it was finally retaken by Malek el\r\n'Adil in 1196. It languished for a time; in the 16th century it was an\r\nalmost uninhabited ruin; but towards the end of the 17th century it\r\nbegan anew to develop as a seaport. In 1799 it was stormed by Napoleon;\r\nthe fortifications were repaired and strengthened by the British.\r\n\r\nThe modern town of Joppa derives its importance, first, as a seaport for\r\nJerusalem and the whole of southern Palestine, and secondly as a centre\r\nof the fruit-growing industry. During the latter part of the 19th\r\ncentury it greatly increased in size. The old city walls have been\r\nentirely removed. Its population is about 35,000 (Moslems 23,000,\r\nChristians 5000, Jews 7000; with the Christians are included the\r\n\"Templars,\" a semi-religious, semi-agricultural German colony of about\r\n320 souls). The town, which rises over a rounded hillock on the coast,\r\nabout 100 ft. high, has a very picturesque appearance from the sea. The\r\nharbour (so-called) is one of the worst existing, being simply a natural\r\nbreakwater formed by a ledge of reefs, safe enough for small Oriental\r\ncraft, but very dangerous for large vessels, which can only make use of\r\nthe seaport in calm weather; these never come nearer than about a mile\r\nfrom the shore. A railway and a bad carriage-road connect Joppa with\r\nJerusalem. The water of the town is derived from wells, many of which\r\nhave a brackish taste. The export trade of the town consists of soap of\r\nolive oil, sesame, barley, water melons, wine and especially oranges\r\n(commonly known as Jaffa oranges), grown in the famous and\r\never-increasing gardens that lie north and east of the town. The chief\r\nimports are timber, cotton and other textile goods, tiles, iron, rice,\r\ncoffee, sugar and petroleum. The value of the exports in 1900 was\r\nestimated at £264,950, the imports £382,405. Over 10,000 pilgrims,\r\nchiefly Russians, and some three or four thousand tourists land annually\r\nat Joppa. The town is the seat of a kaimakam or lieutenant-governor,\r\nsubordinate to the governor of Jerusalem, and contains vice-consulates\r\nof Great Britain, France, Germany, America and other powers. There are\r\nLatin, Greek, Armenian and Coptic monasteries; and hospitals and schools\r\nunder British, French and German auspices.     (R. A. S. M.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJORDAENS, JACOB (1593-1678), Flemish painter, was born and died at\r\nAntwerp. He studied, like Rubens, under Adam van Noort, and his marriage\r\nwith his master's daughter in 1616, the year after his admission to the\r\ngild of painters, prevented him from visiting Rome. He was forced to\r\ncontent himself with studying such examples of the Italian masters as he\r\nfound at home; but a far more potent influence was exerted upon his\r\nstyle by Rubens, who employed him sometimes to reproduce small sketches\r\nin large. Jordaens is second to Rubens alone in their special department\r\nof the Flemish school. In both there is the same warmth of colour, truth\r\nto nature, mastery of chiaroscuro and energy of expression; but Jordaens\r\nis wanting in dignity of conception, and is inferior in choice of forms,\r\nin the character of his heads, and in correctness of drawing. Not seldom\r\nhe sins against good taste, and in some of his humorous pieces the\r\ncoarseness is only atoned for by the animation. Of these last he seems\r\nin some cases to have painted several replicas. He employed his pencil\r\nalso in biblical, mythological, historical and allegorical subjects, and\r\nis well-known as a portrait painter. He also etched some plates.\r\n\r\n  See the elaborate work on the painter, by Max Rooses (1908).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJORDAN, CAMILLE (1771-1821), French politician, was born in Lyons on the\r\n11th of January 1771 of a well-to-do mercantile family. He was educated\r\nin Lyons, and from an early age was imbued with royalist principles. He\r\nactively supported by voice, pen and musket his native town in its\r\nresistance to the Convention; and when Lyons fell, in October 1793,\r\nJordan fled. From Switzerland he passed in six months to England, where\r\nhe formed acquaintances with other French exiles and with prominent\r\nBritish statesmen, and imbibed a lasting admiration for the English\r\nConstitution. In 1796 he returned to France, and next year he was sent\r\nby Lyons as a deputy to the Council of Five Hundred. There his eloquence\r\nwon him consideration. He earnestly supported what he felt to be true\r\nfreedom, especially in matters of religious worship, though the\r\nenergetic appeal on behalf of church bells in his _Rapport sur la\r\nliberté des cultes_ procured him the sobriquet of Jordan-Cloche.\r\nProscribed at the _coup d'état_ of the 18th Fructidor (4th of September\r\n1797) he escaped to Basel. Thence he went to Germany, where he met\r\nGoethe. Back again in France by 1800, he boldly published in 1802 his\r\n_Vrai sens du vote national pour le consulat à vie_, in which he exposed\r\nthe ambitious schemes of Bonaparte. He was unmolested, however, and\r\nduring the First Empire lived in literary retirement at Lyons with his\r\nwife and family, producing for the Lyons academy occasional papers on\r\nthe _Influence réciproque de l'éloquence sur la Révolution et de la\r\nRévolution sur l'éloquence_; _Études sur Klopstock_, &c. At the\r\nrestoration in 1814 he again emerged into public life. By Louis XVIII.\r\nhe was ennobled and named a councillor of state; and from 1816 he sat in\r\nthe chamber of deputies as representative of Ain. At first he supported\r\nthe ministry, but when they began to show signs of reaction he separated\r\nfrom them, and gradually came to be at the head of the constitutional\r\nopposition. His speeches in the chamber were always eloquent and\r\npowerful. Though warned by failing health to resign, Camille Jordan\r\nremained at his post till his death at Paris, on the 19th of May 1821.\r\n\r\n  To his pen we owe _Lettre à M. Lamourette_ (1791); _Histoire de la\r\n  conversion d'une dame Parisienne_ (1792); _La Loi et la religion\r\n  vengées_ (1792); _Adresse à ses commettants sur la révolution du 4\r\n  Septembre 1797_ (1797); _Sur les troubles de Lyon_ (1818); _La Session\r\n  de 1817_ (1818). His _Discours_ were collected in 1818. The \"Fragments\r\n  choisis,\" and translations from the German, were published in\r\n  _L'Abeille française_. Besides the various histories of the time, see\r\n  further details vol. x. of the _Revue encyclopédique_; a paper on\r\n  Jordan and Madame de Staël, by C. A. Sainte-Beuve, in the _Revue des\r\n  deux mondes_ for March 1868 and R. Boubée, \"Camille Jordan à Weimar,\"\r\n  in the _Correspondant_ (1901), ccv. 718-738 and 948-970.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJORDAN, DOROTHEA (1762-1816), Irish actress, was born near Waterford,\r\nIreland, in 1762. Her mother, Grace Phillips, at one time known as Mrs\r\nFrances, was a Dublin actress. Her father, whose name was Bland, was\r\naccording to one account an army captain, but more probably a stage\r\nhand. Dorothy Jordan made her first appearance on the stage in 1777 in\r\nDublin as Phoebe in _As You Like It_. After acting elsewhere in Ireland\r\nshe appeared in 1782 at Leeds, and subsequently at other Yorkshire\r\ntowns, in a variety of parts, including Lady Teazle. It was at this time\r\nthat she began calling herself Mrs Jordan. In 1785 she made her first\r\nLondon appearance at Drury Lane as Peggy in _A Country Girl_. Before the\r\nend of her first season she had become an established public favourite,\r\nher acting in comedy being declared second only to that of Kitty Clive.\r\nHer engagement at Drury Lane lasted till 1809, and she played a large\r\nvariety of parts. But gradually it came to be recognized that her\r\nspecial talent lay in comedy, her Lady Teazle, Rosalind and Imogen being\r\nspecially liked, and such \"breeches\" parts as William in _Rosina_.\r\nDuring the rebuilding of Drury Lane she played at the Haymarket; she\r\ntransferred her services in 1811 to Covent Garden. Here, in 1814, she\r\nmade her last appearance on the London stage, and the following year, at\r\nMargate, retired altogether. Mrs Jordan's private life was one of the\r\nscandals of the period. She had a daughter by her first manager, in\r\nIreland, and four children by Sir Richard Ford, whose name she bore for\r\nsome years. In 1790 she became the mistress of the duke of Clarence\r\n(afterwards William IV.), and bore him ten children, who were ennobled\r\nunder the name of Fitz Clarence, the eldest being created earl of\r\nMunster. In 1811 they separated by mutual consent, Mrs Jordan being\r\ngranted a liberal allowance. In 1815 she went abroad. According to one\r\nstory she was in danger of imprisonment for debt. If so, the debt must\r\nhave been incurred on behalf of others--probably her relations, who\r\nappear to have been continually borrowing from her--for her own personal\r\ndebts were very much more than covered by her savings. She is generally\r\nunderstood to have died at St Cloud, near Paris, on the 3rd of July\r\n1816, but the story that under an assumed name she lived for seven years\r\nafter that date in England finds some credence.\r\n\r\n  See James Boaden, _Life of Mrs Jordan_ (1831); _The Great\r\n  Illegitimates_ (1830); John Genest, _Account of the Stage_; Tate\r\n  Wilkinson, _The Wandering Patentee; Memoirs and Amorous Adventures by\r\n  Sea and Land of King William IV._ (1830); _The Georgian Era_ (1838).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJORDAN, THOMAS (1612?-1685), English poet and pamphleteer, was born in\r\nLondon and started life as an actor at the Red Bull theatre in\r\nClerkenwell. He published in 1637 his first volume of poems, entitled\r\n_Poeticall Varieties_, and in the same year appeared _A Pill to Purge\r\nMelancholy_. In 1639 he recited one of his poems before King Charles I.,\r\nand from this time forward Jordan's output in verse and prose was\r\ncontinuous and prolific. He freely borrowed from other authors, and\r\nfrequently re-issued his own writings under new names. During the\r\ntroubles between the king and the parliament he wrote a number of\r\nRoyalist pamphlets, the first of which, _A Medicine for the Times, or an\r\nAntidote against Faction_, appeared in 1641. Dedications, occasional\r\nverses, prologues and epilogues to plays poured from his pen. Many\r\nvolumes of his poems bear no date, and they were probably written during\r\nthe Commonwealth. At the Restoration he eulogized Monk, produced a\r\nmasque at the entertainment of the general in the city of London and\r\nwrote pamphlets in his support. He then for some years devoted his chief\r\nattention to writing plays, in at least one of which, _Money is an Ass_,\r\nhe himself played a part when it was produced in 1668. In 1671 he was\r\nappointed laureate to the city of London; from this date till his death\r\nin 1685 he annually composed a panegyric on the lord mayor, and arranged\r\nthe pageantry of the lord mayor's shows, which he celebrated in verse\r\nunder such titles as _London Triumphant, or the City in Jollity and\r\nSplendour_ (1672), or _London in Luster, Projecting many Bright Beams of\r\nTriumph_ (1679). Many volumes of these curious productions are preserved\r\nin the British Museum.\r\n\r\n  In addition to his numerous printed works, of which perhaps _A Royal\r\n  Arbour of Loyall Poesie_ (1664) and _A Nursery of Novelties in Variety\r\n  of Poetry_ are most deserving of mention, several volumes of his poems\r\n  exist in manuscript. W. C. Hazlitt and other 19th-century critics\r\n  found more merit in Jordan's writings than was allowed by his\r\n  contemporaries, who for the most part scornfully referred to his\r\n  voluminous productions as commonplace and dull.\r\n\r\n  See Gerard Langbaine, _Account of the English Dramatic Poets_ (1691);\r\n  David Erskine Baker, _Biographia Dramatica_ (4 vols., 1812); W. C.\r\n  Hazlitt, _Handbook to the Popular, Poetical and Dramatic Literature of\r\n  Great Britain_ (1867); F. W. Fairholt, _Lord Mayors Pageants_ (Percy\r\n  Society, 1843), containing a memoir of Thomas Jordan; John Gough\r\n  Nichols, _London Pageants_ (1831).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJORDAN, WILHELM (1819-1904), German poet and novelist, was born at\r\nInsterburg in East Prussia on the 8th of February 1819. He studied,\r\nfirst theology and then philosophy and natural science, at the\r\nuniversities of Konigsberg and Berlin. He settled in Leipzig as a\r\njournalist; but the democratic views expressed in some essays and the\r\nvolumes of poems _Glocke und Kanone_ (1481) and _Irdische Phantasien_\r\n(1842) led to his expulsion from Saxony in 1846. He next engaged in\r\nliterary and tutorial work in Bremen, and on the outbreak of the\r\nrevolution, in February 1848, was sent to Paris, as correspondent of the\r\n_Bremer Zeitung_. He almost immediately, however, returned to Germany\r\nand, throwing himself into the political fray in Berlin, was elected\r\nmember for Freienwalde, in the first German parliament at\r\nFrankfort-on-Main. For a short while he sided with the Left, but soon\r\njoined the party of von Gagern. On a vote having been passed for the\r\nestablishment of a German navy, he was appointed secretary of the\r\ncommittee to deal with the whole question, and was subsequently made\r\nministerial councillor (_Ministerialrat_) in the naval department of the\r\ngovernment. The naval project was abandoned, Jordan was pensioned and\r\nafterwards resided at Frankfort-on-Main until his death on the 25th of\r\nJune 1904, devoting himself to literary work, acting as his own\r\npublisher, and producing numerous poems, novels, dramas and\r\ntranslations.\r\n\r\n  Among his best known works are: _Demiurgos_ (3 vols., 1852-1854), a\r\n  \"Mysterium,\" in which he attempted to deal with the problems of human\r\n  existence, but the work found little favour; _Nibelunge_, an epic poem\r\n  in alliterative verse, in two parts, (1) _Sigfnedsage_ (1867-1868;\r\n  13th ed. 1889) and (2) _Hildebrants Heimkehr_ (1874; 10th ed.\r\n  1892)--in the first part he is regarded as having been remarkably\r\n  successful; a tragedy, _Die Wittwe des Agis_ (1858); the comedies,\r\n  _Die Liebesleugner_ (1855) and _Durchs Ohr_ (1870; 6th ed. 1885); and\r\n  the novels _Die Sebalds_ (1885) and _Zwei Wiegen_ (1887). Jordan also\r\n  published numerous translations, notably _Homers Odyssee_ (1876; 2nd\r\n  ed. 1889) and _Homers Ilias_ (1881; 2nd ed. 1894); _Die Edda_ (1889).\r\n  He was also distinguished as a reciter, and on a visit to the United\r\n  States in 1871 read extracts from his works before large audiences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJORDAN (the down-comer; Arab. _esh-Sheri'a_, the watering-place), the\r\nonly river of Palestine and one of the most remarkable in the world. It\r\nflows from north to south in a deep trough-like valley, the Aulon of the\r\nGreeks and Ghor of the Arabs, which is usually believed to follow the\r\nline of a fault or fracture of the earth's crust. Most geologists hold\r\nthat the valley is part of an old sea-bed, traces of which remain in\r\nnumerous shingle-banks and beach-levels. This, they say, once extended\r\nto the Red Sea and even over N.E. Africa. Shrinkage caused the pelagic\r\nlimestone bottom to be upheaved in two ridges, between which occurred a\r\nlong fracture, which can now be traced from Coelesyria down the Wadi\r\nAraba to the Gulf of Akaba. The Jordan valley in its lower part keeps\r\nabout the old level of the sea-bottom and is therefore a remnant of the\r\nMiocene world. This theory, however, is not universally accepted, some\r\nauthorities preferring to assume a succession of more strictly local\r\nelevations and depressions, connected with the recent volcanic activity\r\nof the Jaulan and Lija districts on the east bank, which brought the\r\ncontours finally to their actual form. In any case the number of\r\ndistinct sea-beaches seems to imply a succession of convulsive changes,\r\nmore recent than the great Miocene upheaval, which are responsible for\r\nthe shrinkage of the water into the three isolated pans now found. For\r\nmore than two-thirds of its course the Jordan lies below the level of\r\nthe sea. It has never been navigable, no important town has ever been\r\nbuilt on its banks, and it runs into an inland sea which has no port and\r\nis destitute of aquatic life. Throughout history it has exerted a\r\nseparatist influence, roughly dividing the settled from the nomadic\r\npopulations; and the crossing of Jordan, one way or the other, was\r\nalways an event in the history of Israel. In Hebrew times its valley was\r\nregarded as a \"wilderness\" and, except in the Roman era, seems always to\r\nhave been as sparsely inhabited as now. From its sources to the Dead Sea\r\nit rushes down a continuous inclined plane, broken here and there by\r\nrapids and small falls; between the Sea of Galilee and the Dead Sea its\r\nsinuosity is so great that in a direct distance of 65 m. it traverses at\r\nleast 200 m. The mean fall is about 9 ft. in the mile. The Jordan has\r\ntwo great sources, one in Tell el-Kadi (Dan) whence springs the Nahr\r\nLeddan, a stream 12 ft. broad at its birth; the other at Banias (anc.\r\nPaneas, Caesarea-Philippi), some 4 m. N., where the Nahr Banias issues\r\nfrom a cave, about 30 ft. broad. But two longer streams with less water\r\ncontest their claim, the Nahr Barrighit from Coelesyria, which rises\r\nnear the springs of the Litany, and the Nahr Hasbany from Hermon. The\r\nfour streams unite below the fortress of Banias, which once held the\r\ngate of the valley, and flow into a marshy tract now called Huleh\r\n(Semechonitis, and perhaps Merom of Joshua). There the Jordan begins to\r\nfall below sea-level, rushing down 680 ft. in 9 m. to a delta, which\r\nopens into the Sea of Galilee. Thereafter it follows a valley which is\r\nusually not above 4 m. broad, but opens out twice into the small plains\r\nof Bethshan and Jericho. The river actually flows in a depression, the\r\nZor, from a quarter to 2 m. wide, which it has hollowed out for itself\r\nin the bed of the Ghor. During the rainy season (January and February),\r\nwhen the Jordan overflows its banks, the Zor is flooded, but when the\r\nwater falls it produces rich crops. The floor of the Ghor falls gently\r\nto the Zor, and is intersected by deep channels, which have been cut by\r\nthe small streams and winter torrents that traverse it on their way to\r\nthe Jordan. As far south as Kurn Surtabeh most of the valley is fertile,\r\nand even between that point and the Dead Sea there are several\r\nwell-watered oases. In summer the heat in the Ghor is intense, 110° F.\r\nin the shade, but in winter the temperature falls to 40°, and sometimes\r\nto 32° at night. During the seasons of rain and melting snow the river\r\nis very full, and liable to freshets. After twelve hours' rain it has\r\nbeen known to rise from 4 to 5 ft., and to fall as rapidly. In 1257 the\r\nJordan was dammed up for several hours by a landslip, probably due to\r\nheavy rain. On leaving the Sea of Galilee the water is quite clear, but\r\nit soon assumes a tawny colour from the soft marl which it washes away\r\nfrom its banks and deposits in the Dead Sea. On the whole it is an\r\nunpleasant foul stream running between poisonous banks, and as such it\r\nseems to have been regarded by the Jews and other Syrians. The Hebrew\r\npoets did not sing its praises, and others compared it unfavourably with\r\nthe clear rivers of Damascus. The clay of the valley was used for\r\nbrickmaking, and Solomon established brass foundries there. From\r\ncrusading times to this day it has grown sugar-cane. In Roman times it\r\nhad extensive palm-groves and some small towns (e.g. Livias or Julias\r\nopposite Jericho) and villages. The Jordan is crossed by two stone\r\nbridges--one north of Lake Huleh, the other between that lake and the\r\nSea of Galilee--and by a wooden bridge on the road from Jerusalem to\r\nGilead and Moab. During the Roman period, and almost to the end of the\r\nArab supremacy, there were bridges on all the great lines of\r\ncommunication between eastern and western Palestine, and ferries at\r\nother places. The depth of water varies greatly with the season. When\r\nnot in flood the river is often fordable, and between the Sea of Galilee\r\nand the Dead Sea there are then more than fifty fords--some of them of\r\nhistoric interest. The only difficulty is occasioned by the erratic\r\nzigzag current. The natural products of the Jordan valley--a tropical\r\noasis sunk in the temperate zone, and overhung by Alpine Hermon--are\r\nunique. Papyrus grows in Lake Huleh, and rice and cereals thrive on its\r\nshores, whilst below the Sea of Galilee the vegetation is almost\r\ntropical. The flora and fauna present a large infusion of Ethiopian\r\ntypes; and the fish, with which the river is abundantly stocked, have a\r\ngreat affinity with those of the rivers and lakes of east Africa. Ere\r\nthe Jordan enters the Dead Sea, its valley has become very barren and\r\nforbidding. It reaches the lake at a minus level of 1290 ft., the\r\ndepression continuing downwards to twice that depth in the bed of the\r\nDead Sea. It receives two affluents, with perennial waters, on the left,\r\nthe Yarmuk (Hieromax) which flows in from the volcanic Jaulan a little\r\nsouth of the Sea of Galilee, and the Zerka (Jabbok) which comes from the\r\nBelka district to a point more than half-way down the lower course. On\r\nthe right the Jalud descends from the plain of Esdraelon to near Beisan,\r\nand the Far'a from near Nablus. Various salt springs rise in the lower\r\nvalley. The rest of the tributaries are wadis, dry except after rains.\r\n\r\nSuch human life as may be found in the valley now is mainly migratory.\r\nThe Samaritan villagers use it in winter as pasture-ground, and, with\r\nthe Circassians and Arabs of the east bank, cultivate plots here and\r\nthere. They retire on the approach of summer. Jericho is the only\r\nconsiderable settlement in the lower valley, and it lies some distance\r\nwest of the stream on the lower slopes of the Judaean heights.\r\n\r\n  See W. F.

All that we certainly know about his life is\r\ncontained in three sentences of his history of the Goths (cap. 50), from\r\nwhich, among other particulars as to the history of his family, we learn\r\nthat his grandfather Paria was notary to Candac, the chief of a\r\nconfederation of Alans and other tribes settled during the latter half\r\nof the 5th century on the south of the Danube in the provinces which are\r\nnow Bulgaria and the Dobrudscha. Jordanes himself was the notary of\r\nCandac's nephew, the Gothic chief Gunthigis, until he took the vows of a\r\nmonk. This, according to the manner of speaking of that day, is the\r\nmeaning of his words _ante conversionem meam_, though it is quite\r\npossible that he may at the same time have renounced the Arian creed of\r\nhis forefathers, which it is clear that he no longer held when he wrote\r\nhis Gothic history. The _Getica_ of Jordanes shows Gothic sympathies;\r\nbut these are probably due to an imitation of the tone of Cassiodorus,\r\nfrom whom he draws practically all his material. He was not himself a\r\nGoth, belonging to a confederation of Germanic tribes, embracing Alans\r\nand Scyrians, which had come under the influence of the Ostrogoths\r\nsettled on the lower Danube; and his own sympathies are those of a\r\nmember of this confederation. He is accordingly friendly to the Goths,\r\neven apart from the influence of Cassiodorus; but he is also\r\nprepossessed in favour of the eastern emperors in whose territories this\r\nconfederation lived and whose subject he himself was. This makes him an\r\nimpartial authority on the last days of the Ostrogoths. At the same\r\ntime, living in Moesia, he is restricted in his outlook to Danubian\r\naffairs. He has little to say of the inner history and policy of the\r\nkingdom of Theodoric: his interests lie, as Mommsen says, within a\r\ntriangle of which the three points are Sirmium, Larissa and\r\nConstantinople. Finally, connected as he was with the Alans, he shows\r\nhimself friendly to them, whenever they enter into his narrative.\r\n\r\nWe pass from the extremely shadowy personality of Jordanes to the more\r\ninteresting question of his works.\r\n\r\n1. The _Romana_, or, as he himself calls it, _De summa temporum vel\r\norigine actibusque gentis Romanorum_, was composed in 551. It was begun\r\nbefore, but published after, the _Getica_. It is a sketch of the history\r\nof the world from the creation, based on Jerome, the epitome of Florus,\r\nOrosius and the ecclesiastical history of Socrates. There is a curious\r\nreference to Iamblichus, apparently the neo-platonist philosopher, whose\r\nname Jordanes, being, as he says himself, _agrammatus_, inserts by way\r\nof a flourish. The work is only of any value for the century 450-550,\r\nwhen Jordanes is dealing with recent history. It is merely a hasty\r\ncompilation intended to stand side by side with the _Getica_.[2]\r\n\r\n2. The other work of Jordanes commonly called _De rebus Geticis_ or\r\n_Getica_, was styled by himself _De origine actibusque Getarum_, and\r\nwas also written in 551. He informs us that while he was engaged upon\r\nthe _Romana_ a friend named Castalius invited him to compress into one\r\nsmall treatise the twelve books--now lost--of the senator Cassiodorus,\r\non _The Origin and Actions of the Goths_. Jordanes professes to have had\r\nthe work of Cassiodorus in his hands for but three days, and to\r\nreproduce the sense not the words; but his book, short as it is,\r\nevidently contains long verbatim extracts from the earlier author, and\r\nit may be suspected that the story of the _triduana lectio_ and the\r\napology _quamvis verba non recolo_, possibly even the friendly\r\ninvitation of Castalius, are mere blinds to cover his own entire want of\r\noriginality. This suspicion is strengthened by the fact (discovered by\r\nvon Sybel) that even the very preface to his book is taken almost word\r\nfor word from Rufinus's translation of Origen's commentary on the\r\nepistle to the Romans. There is no doubt, even on Jordanes' own\r\nstatements, that his work is based upon that of Cassiodorus, and that\r\nany historical worth which it possesses is due to that fact. Cassiodorus\r\nwas one of the very few men who, Roman by birth and sympathies, could\r\nyet appreciate the greatness of the barbarians by whom the empire was\r\noverthrown. The chief adviser of Theodoric, the East Gothic king in\r\nItaly, he accepted with ardour that monarch's great scheme, if indeed,\r\nhe did not himself originally suggest it, of welding Roman and Goth\r\ntogether into one harmonious state which should preserve the social\r\nrefinement and the intellectual culture of the Latin-speaking races\r\nwithout losing the hardy virtues of their Teutonic conquerors. To this\r\naim everything in the political life of Cassiodorus was subservient, and\r\nthis aim he evidently kept before him in his Gothic history. But in\r\nwriting that history Cassiodorus was himself indebted to the work of a\r\ncertain Ablabius. It was Ablabius, apparently, who had first used the\r\nGothic sagas (_prisca carmina_); it was he who had constructed the stem\r\nof the Amals. Whether he was a Greek, a Roman or a Goth we do not know;\r\nnor can we say when he wrote, though his work may be dated conjecturally\r\nin the early part of the reign of Theodoric the Great. We can only say\r\nthat he wrote on the origin and history of the Goths, using both Gothic\r\nsaga and Greek sources; and that if Jordanes used Cassiodorus,\r\nCassiodorus used, if to a less extent, the work of Ablabius.\r\n\r\nCassiodorus began his work, at the request of Theodoric, and therefore\r\nbefore 526: it was finished by 533. At the root of the work lies a\r\ntheory, whencesoever derived, which identified the Goths with the\r\nScythians, whose country Darius Hystaspes invaded, and with the Getae of\r\nDacia, whom Trajan conquered. This double identification enabled\r\nCassiodorus to bring the favoured race into line with the peoples of\r\nclassical antiquity, to interweave with their history stories about\r\nHercules and the Amazons, to make them invade Egypt, to claim for them a\r\nshare in the wisdom of the semi-mythical Scythian philosopher Zamolxis.\r\nHe was thus able with some show of plausibility to represent the Goths\r\nas \"wiser than all the other barbarians and almost like the Greeks\"\r\n(Jord., _De reb. Get._, cap. v.), and to send a son of the Gothic king\r\nTelephus to fight at the siege of Troy, with the ancestors of the\r\nRomans. All this we can now perceive to have no relation to history, but\r\nat the time it may have made the subjugation of the Roman less bitter to\r\nfeel that he was not after all bowing down before a race of barbarian\r\nupstarts, but that his Amal sovereign was as firmly rooted in classical\r\nantiquity as any Julius or Claudius who ever wore the purple. In the\r\neighteen years which elapsed between 533 and the composition of the\r\n_Getica_ of Jordanes, great events, most disastrous for the\r\nRomano-Gothic monarchy of Theodoric, had taken place. It was no longer\r\npossible to write as if the whole civilization of the Western world\r\nwould sit down contentedly under the shadow of East Gothic dominion and\r\nAmal sovereignty. And, moreover, the instincts of Jordanes, as a subject\r\nof the Eastern Empire, predisposed him to flatter the sacred majesty of\r\nJustinian, by whose victorious arms the overthrow of the barbarian\r\nkingdom in Italy had been effected. Hence we perceive two currents of\r\ntendency in the _Getica_. On the one hand, as a transcriber of the\r\nphilo-Goth Cassiodorus, he magnifies the race of Alaric and Theodoric,\r\nand claims for them their full share, perhaps more than their full\r\nshare, of glory in the past. On the other hand he speaks of the great\r\nanti-Teuton emperor Justinian, and of his reversal of the German\r\nconquests of the 5th century, in language which would certainly have\r\ngrated on the ears of Totila and his heroes. When Ravenna is taken, and\r\nVitigis carried into captivity, Jordanes almost exults in the fact that\r\n\"the nobility of the Amals and the illustrious offspring of so many\r\nmighty men have surrendered to a yet more illustrious prince and a yet\r\nmightier general, whose fame shall not grow dim through all the\r\ncenturies.\" (_Getica_, lx. § 315).\r\n\r\nThis laudation, both of the Goths and of their Byzantine conquerors, may\r\nperhaps help us to understand the motive with which the _Getica_ was\r\nwritten. In the year 551 Germanus, nephew of Justinian, accompanied by\r\nhis bride, Matasuntha, grand-daughter of Theodoric, set forth to\r\nreconquer Italy for the empire. His early death prevented any schemes\r\nfor a revived Romano-Gothic kingdom which may have been based on his\r\npersonality. His widow, however, bore a posthumous child, also named\r\nGermanus, of whom Jordanes speaks (cap. 60) as \"blending the blood of\r\nthe Anicii and the Amals, and furnishing a hope under the divine\r\nblessing of one day uniting their glories.\" This younger Germanus did\r\nnothing in after life to realize these anticipations; but the somewhat\r\npointed way in which his name and his mother's name are mentioned by\r\nJordanes lends some probability to the view that he hoped for the\r\nchild's succession to the Eastern Empire, and the final reconciliation\r\nof the Goths and Romans in the person of a Gotho-Roman emperor.\r\n\r\n  The _De rebus Geticis_ falls naturally into four parts. The first\r\n  (chs. i.-xiii.) commences with a geographical description of the three\r\n  quarters of the world, and in more detail of Britain and Scanzia\r\n  (Sweden), from which the Goths under their king Berig migrated to the\r\n  southern coast of the Baltic. Their migration across what has since\r\n  been called Lithuania to the shores of the Euxine, and their\r\n  differentiation into Visigoths and Ostrogoths, are next described.\r\n  Chs. v.-xiii. contain an account of the intrusive Geto-Scythian\r\n  element before alluded to.\r\n\r\n  The second section (chs. xiv.-xxiv.) returns to the true history of\r\n  the Gothic nation, sets forth the genealogy of the Amal kings, and\r\n  describes the inroads of the Goths into the Roman Empire in the 3rd\r\n  century, with the foundation and the overthrow of the great but\r\n  somewhat shadowy kingdom of Hermanric.\r\n\r\n  The third section (chs. xxv.-xlvii.) traces the history of the West\r\n  Goths from the Hunnish invasion to the downfall of the Gothic kingdom\r\n  in Gaul under Alaric II. (376-507). The best part of this section, and\r\n  indeed of the whole book, is the seven chapters devoted to Attila's\r\n  invasion of Gaul and the battle of the Mauriac plains. Here we have in\r\n  all probability a verbatim extract from Cassiodorus, who (possibly\r\n  resting on Ablabius) interwove with his narrative large portions of\r\n  the Gothic sagas. The celebrated expression _certaminis gaudia_\r\n  assuredly came at first neither from the suave minister Cassiodorus\r\n  nor from the small-souled notary Jordanes, but is the translation of\r\n  some thought which first found utterance through the lips of a Gothic\r\n  minstrel.\r\n\r\n  The fourth section (chs. xlviii.-lx.) traces the history of the East\r\n  Goths from the same Hunnish invasion to the first overthrow of the\r\n  Gothic monarchy in Italy (376-539). In this fourth section are\r\n  inserted, somewhat out of their proper place, some valuable details as\r\n  to the _Gothi Minores_, \"an immense people dwelling in the region of\r\n  Nicopolis, with their high priest and primate Vulfilas, who is said\r\n  also to have taught them letters.\" The book closes with the allusion\r\n  to Germanus and the panegyric on Justinian as the conqueror of the\r\n  Goths referred to above.\r\n\r\n  Jordanes refers in the _Getica_ to a number of authors besides\r\n  Cassiodorus; but he owes his knowledge of them to Cassiodorus. It is\r\n  perhaps only when he is using Orosius that we can hold Jordanes to\r\n  have borrowed directly. Otherwise, as Mommsen says, the _Getica is a\r\n  mera epitome, laxata ea et perversa, historiae Gothicae\r\n  Cassiodorianae_.\r\n\r\n  As to the style and literary character of Jordanes, every author who\r\n  has used him speaks in terms of severe censure. When he is left to\r\n  himself and not merely transcribing, he is sometimes scarcely\r\n  grammatical. There are awkward gaps in his narrative and statements\r\n  inconsistent with each other. He quotes, as if he were familiarly\r\n  acquainted with their writings, a number of Greek and Roman writers,\r\n  of whom it is almost certain that he had not read more than one or\r\n  two. At the same time he does not quote the chronicler Marcellinus,\r\n  from whom he has copied verbatim the history of the deposition of\r\n  Augustulus. All these faults make him a peculiarly unsatisfactory\r\n  authority where we cannot check his statements by those of other\r\n  authors. It may, however, be pleaded in extenuation that he is\r\n  professedly a transcriber, and, if his story be correct, a\r\n  transcriber in peculiarly unfavourable circumstances. He has also\r\n  himself suffered much from the inaccuracy of copyists. But nothing has\r\n  really been more unfortunate for the reputation of Jordanes as a\r\n  writer than the extreme preciousness of the information which he has\r\n  preserved to us. The Teutonic tribes whose dim origins he records have\r\n  in the course of centuries attained to world-wide dominion. The battle\r\n  in the Mauriac plains of which he is really the sole historian, is now\r\n  seen to have had important bearings on the destinies of the world. And\r\n  thus the hasty pamphlet of a half-educated Gothic monk has been forced\r\n  into prominence, almost into rivalry with the finished productions of\r\n  the great writers of classical antiquity. No wonder that it stands the\r\n  comparison badly; but with all its faults the _Getica_ of Jordanes\r\n  will probably ever retain its place side by side with the _De moribus\r\n  Germanorum_ of Tacitus as a chief source of information respecting the\r\n  history, institutions and modes of thought of our Teutonic\r\n  forefathers.\r\n\r\n  EDITIONS.--The classical edition is that of Mommsen (in _Mon. Germ.\r\n  hist. auct. antiq._, v., ii.), which supersedes the older editions,\r\n  such as that in the first volume of Muratori's _Scriptt. rer. Ital._\r\n  The best MS. is the Heidelberg MS., written in Germany, probably in\r\n  the 8th century; but this perished in the fire at Mommsen's house. The\r\n  next of the MSS. in value are the Vaticanus Palatinus of the 10th\r\n  century, and the Valenciennes MS. of the 9th.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--Von Sybel's essay, _De fontibus Jordanis_ (1838);\r\n  Schirren's _De ratione quae inter Jordanem et Cassiodorum intercedat\r\n  Commentatio_ (Dorpat, 1858); Kopke's _Die Anfänge des Königthums\r\n  beiden Gothen_ (Berlin, 1859); Dahn's _Die Könige der Germanen_, vol.\r\n  ii.

In 1302 he may have accompanied the famous Thomas of\r\nTolentino, via Negropont, to the East; but it is only in 1321 that we\r\ndefinitely discover him in western India, in the company of the same\r\nThomas and certain other Franciscan missionaries on their way to China.\r\nIll-luck detained them at Tana in Salsette island, near Bombay; and here\r\nJordanus' companions (\"the four martyrs of Tana\") fell victims to Moslem\r\nfanaticism (April 7, 1321). Jordanus, escaping, worked some time at\r\nBaruch in Gujarat, near the Nerbudda estuary, and at Suali (?) near\r\nSurat; to his fellow-Dominicans in north Persia he wrote two\r\nletters--the first from Gogo in Gujarat (October 12, 1321), the second\r\nfrom Tana (January 24, 1323/4)--describing the progress of this new\r\nmission. From these letters we learn that Roman attention had already\r\nbeen directed, not only to the Bombay region, but also to the extreme\r\nsouth of the Indian peninsula, especially to \"Columbum,\" Quilon, or\r\nKulam in Travancore; Jordanus' words may imply that he had already\r\nstarted a mission there before October 1321. From Catholic traders he\r\nhad learnt that Ethiopia (i.e. Abyssinia and Nubia) was accessible to\r\nWestern Europeans; at this very time, as we know from other sources, the\r\nearliest Latin missionaries penetrated thither. Finally, the _Epistles_\r\nof Jordanus, like the contemporary _Secreta_ of Marino Sanuto\r\n(1306-1321), urge the pope to establish a Christian fleet upon the\r\nIndian seas. Jordanus, between 1324 and 1328 (if not earlier), probably\r\nvisited Kulam and selected it as the best centre for his future work; it\r\nwould also appear that he revisited Europe about 1328, passing through\r\nPersia, and perhaps touching at the great Crimean port of Soldaia or\r\nSudak. He was appointed a bishop in 1328 and nominated by Pope John\r\nXXII. to the see of Columbum in 1330. Together with the new bishop of\r\nSamarkand, Thomas of Mancasola, Jordanus was commissioned to take the\r\npall to John de Cora, archbishop of Sultaniyah in Persia, within whose\r\nprovince Kulam was reckoned; he was also commended to the Christians of\r\nsouth India, both east and west of Cape Comorin, by Pope John. Either\r\nbefore going out to Malabar as bishop, or during a later visit to the\r\nwest, Jordanus probably wrote his _Mirabilia_, which from internal\r\nevidence can only be fixed within the period 1329-1338; in this work he\r\nfurnished the best account of Indian regions, products, climate,\r\nmanners, customs, fauna and flora given by any European in the Middle\r\nAges--superior even to Marco Polo's. In his triple division of the\r\nIndies, India Major comprises the shorelands from Malabar to Cochin\r\nChina; while India Minor stretches from Sind (or perhaps from\r\nBaluchistan) to Malabar; and India Tertia (evidently dominated by\r\nAfrican conceptions in his mind) includes a vast undefined coast-region\r\nwest of Baluchistan, reaching into the neighbourhood of, but not\r\nincluding, Ethiopia and Prester John's domain. Jordanus' _Mirabilia_\r\ncontains the earliest clear African identification of Prester John, and\r\nwhat is perhaps the first notice of the Black Sea under that name; it\r\nrefers to the author's residence in India Major and especially at Kulam,\r\nas well as to his travels in Armenia, north-west Persia, the Lake Van\r\nregion, and Chaldaea; and it supplies excellent descriptions of Parsee\r\ndoctrines and burial customs, of Hindu ox-worship, idol-ritual, and\r\nsuttee, and of Indian fruits, birds, animals and insects. After the 8th\r\nof April 1330 we have no more knowledge of Bishop Jordanus.\r\n\r\n  Of Jordanus' _Epistles_ there is only one MS., viz. Paris, National\r\n  Library, 5006 Lat., fol. 182, r. and v.; of the _Mirabilia_ also one\r\n  MS. only, viz. London, British Museum, _Additional MSS._, 19,513,\r\n  fols. 3, r.-12 r. The text of the _Epistles_ is in Quétif and Echard,\r\n  _Scriptores ordinis praedicatorum_, i. 549-550 (Epistle I.); and in\r\n  Wadding, _Annales minorum_, vi. 359-361 (Epistle II.); the text of the\r\n  _Mirabilia_ in the Paris Geog. Soc.'s _Recueil de voyages_, iv. 1-68\r\n  (1839). The Papal letters referring to Jordanus are in Raynaldus,\r\n  _Annales ecclesiastici_, 1330, §§ lv. and lvii. (April 8; Feb. 14).\r\n  See also Sir H. Yule's _Jordanus_, a version of the _Mirabilia_ with a\r\n  commentary (Hakluyt Soc., 1863) and the same editor's _Cathay_, giving\r\n  a version of the _Epistles_, with a commentary, &c. (Hak.

B.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJORIS, DAVID, the common name of JAN JORISZ or JORISZOON (c. 1501-1556),\r\nAnabaptist heresiarch who called himself later JAN VAN BRUGGE; was born\r\nin 1501 or 1502, probably in Flanders, at Ghent or Bruges. His father,\r\nGeorgius Joris de Koman, otherwise Joris van Amersfoordt, probably a\r\nnative of Bruges, was a shopkeeper and amateur actor at Delft; from the\r\ncircumstance that he played the part of King David, his son received the\r\nname of David, but probably not in baptism. His mother was Marytje,\r\ndaughter of Jan de Gorter, of a good family in Delft. As a child he was\r\nclever and delicate. He seems then or later to have acquired some\r\ntincture of learning. His first known occupation was that of a\r\nglass-painter; in 1522 he painted windows for the church at Enkhuizen,\r\nNorth Holland (the birthplace of Paul Potter). In pursuit of his art he\r\ntravelled, and is said to have reached England; ill-health drove him\r\nhomewards in 1524, in which year he married Dirckgen Willems at Delft.\r\nIn the same year the Lutheran reformation took hold of him, and he began\r\nto issue appeals in prose and verse against the Mass and against the\r\npope as antichrist. On Ascension Day 1528 he committed an outrage on the\r\nsacrament carried in procession; he was placed in the pillory, had his\r\ntongue bored, and was banished from Delft for three years. He turned to\r\nthe Anabaptists, was rebaptized in 1533, and for some years led a\r\nwandering life. He came into relations with John à Lasco, and with Menno\r\nSimons. Much influenced by Melchior Hofman, he had no sympathy with the\r\nfanatic violence of the Münster faction. At the Buckholdt conference in\r\nAugust 1536 he played a mediating part. His mother, in 1537, suffered\r\nmartyrdom as an Anabaptist. Soon after he took up a rôle of his own,\r\nhaving visions and a gift of prophecy. He adapted in his own interest\r\nthe theory (constantly recurrent among mystics and innovators, from the\r\ntime of Abbot Joachim to the present day) of three dispensations, the\r\nold, with its revelation of the Father, the newer with its revelation of\r\nthe Son, and the final or era of the Spirit. Of this newest revelation\r\nChristus David was the mouthpiece, supervening on Christus Jesus. From\r\nthe 1st of April 1544, bringing with him some of his followers, he took\r\nup his abode in Basel, which was to be the New Jerusalem. Here he styled\r\nhimself Jan van Brugge. His identity was unknown to the authorities of\r\nBasel, who had no suspicion of his heresies. By his writings he\r\nmaintained his hold on his numerous followers in Holland and Friesland.\r\nThese monotonous writings, all in Dutch, flowed in a continual stream\r\nfrom 1524 (though none is extant before 1529) and amounted to over 200\r\nin number. His _magnum opus_ was _'T Wonder Boeck_ (_n.d._ 1542, divided\r\ninto two parts; 1551, handsomely reprinted, divided into four parts;\r\nboth editions anonymous). Its chief claim to recognition is its use, in\r\nthe latter part, of the phrase _Restitutio Christi_, which apparently\r\nsuggested to Servetus his title _Christianismi Restitutio_ (1553). In\r\nthe 1st edition is a figure of the \"new man,\" signed with the author's\r\nmonogram, and probably drawn as a likeness of himself; it fairly\r\ncorresponds with the alleged portrait, engraved in 1607, reproduced in\r\nthe appendix to A. Ross's _Pansebeia_ (1655), and idealized by P.\r\nBurckhardt in 1900. Another work, _Verklaringe der Scheppenissen_ (1553)\r\ntreats mystically the book of Genesis, a favourite theme with Boehme,\r\nSwedenborg and others. His remaining writings exhibit all that easy\r\ndribble of triumphant muddiness which disciples take as depth. His wife\r\ndied on the 22nd of August, and his own death followed on the 25th of\r\nAugust 1556. He was buried, with all religious honours, in the church of\r\nSt Leonard, Basel. Three years later, Nicolas Blesdijk, who had married\r\nhis eldest daughter Jannecke (Susanna), but had lost confidence in\r\nJorisz some time before his death, denounced the dead man to the\r\nauthorities of Basel. An investigation was begun in March 1559, and as\r\nthe result of a conviction for heresy the exhumed body of Jorisz was\r\nburned, together with his portrait, on the 13th of May 1559. Blesdijk's\r\n_Historia_ (not printed till 1642) accuses Jorisz of having _plures\r\nuxores_. Of this there is no confirmation. Theoretically Jorisz regarded\r\npolygamy as lawful; there is no proof that his theory affected his own\r\npractice.\r\n\r\n  The first attempt at a true account of Jorisz was by Gottfried Arnold,\r\n  in his anonymous _Historia_ (1713), pursued with much fuller material\r\n  in his _Kirchen und Ketzer Historie_ (best ed. 1740-1742). See also F.\r\n  Nippold, in _Zeitschrift für die historische Theologie_ (1863, 1864,\r\n  1868); A. van der Linde, in _Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie_ (1881);\r\n  P. Burckhardt, _Basler Biographien_ (1900); Hegler, in Hauck's\r\n  _Realencyklopädie_ (1901), and the bibliography by A. van der Linde,\r\n  1867, supplemented by E. Weller, 1869.     (A. Go.*)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJORTIN, JOHN (1698-1770), English theologian, the son of a Protestant\r\nrefugee from Brittany, was born in London on the 23rd of October 1698.\r\nHe went to Charterhouse School, and in 1715 became a pensioner of Jesus\r\nCollege, Cambridge, where his reputation as a Greek scholar led to his\r\nbeing selected to translate certain passages from Eustathius for the\r\nnotes to Pope's _Homer_. In 1722 he published a small volume of Latin\r\nverse entitled _Lusus poetici_. Having taken orders in 1724, he was in\r\n1726 presented by his college to the vicarage of Swavesey in\r\nCambridgeshire, which he resigned in 1730 to become preacher at a\r\nchapel-of-ease in New Street, London. In 1731, along with some friends,\r\nhe began a publication entitled _Miscellaneous Observations on Authors\r\nAncient and Modern_, which appeared at intervals during two years. He\r\nwas Boyle lecturer in 1749. Shortly after becoming chaplain to the\r\nbishop of London in 1762 he was appointed to a prebendal stall of St\r\nPaul's and to the vicarage of Kensington, and in 1764 he was made\r\narchdeacon of London. He died at Kensington on the 5th of September\r\n1770.\r\n\r\n  The principal works of Jortin are: _Discussions Concerning the Truth\r\n  of the Christian Religion_ (1746); _Remarks on Ecclesiastical History_\r\n  (3 vols. 1751-2-4); _Life of Erasmus_ (2 vols. 1750, 1760) founded on\r\n  the Life by Jean Le Clerc; and _Tracts Philological Critical and\r\n  Miscellaneous_ (1790). A collection of his _Various Works_ appeared in\r\n  1805-1810. All his writings display wide learning and acuteness. He\r\n  writes on theological subjects with the detachment of a thoughtful\r\n  layman, and is witty without being flippant. See John Disney's _Life\r\n  of Jortin_ (1792).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOSEPH, in the Old Testament, the son of the patriarch Jacob by Rachel;\r\nthe name of a tribe of Israel. Two explanations of the name are given by\r\nthe Biblical narrator (Gen. xxx. 23 [E], 24 [J]); a third, \"He (God)\r\nincreases,\" seems preferable. Unlike the other \"sons\" of Jacob, Joseph\r\nis usually reckoned as two tribes (viz. his \"sons\" Ephraim and\r\nManasseh), and closely associated with it is the small tribe of Benjamin\r\n(q.v.), which lay immediately to the south. These three constituted the\r\n\"sons\" of Rachel (the ewe), and with the \"sons\" of Leah (the antelope?)\r\nare thus on a higher level than the \"sons\" of Jacob's concubines. The\r\n\"house of Joseph\" and its offshoots occupied the centre of Palestine\r\nfrom the plain of Esdraelon to the mountain country of Benjamin, with\r\ndependencies in Bashan and northern Gilead (see MANASSEH). Practically\r\nit comprised the northern kingdom, and the name is used in this sense in\r\n2 Sam. xix. 20; Amos v. 6; vi. 6 (note the prominence of Joseph in the\r\nblessings of Jacob and Moses, Gen. xlix., Deut. xxxiii.). Originally,\r\nhowever, \"Joseph\" was more restricted, possibly to the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of Shechem, its later extension being parallel to the\r\ndevelopment of the name Jacob. The dramatic story of the tribal ancestor\r\nis recounted in Gen. xxxvii.-l. (see GENESIS). Joseph, the younger and\r\nenvied son, is seized by his brothers at Dothan north of Shechem, and is\r\nsold to a party of Ishmaelites or Midianites, who carry him down to\r\nEgypt. After various vicissitudes he gains the favour of the king of\r\nEgypt by the interpretation of a dream, and obtains a high place in the\r\nkingdom.[1] Forced by a famine his brothers come to buy food, and in the\r\nincidents that follow Joseph shows his preference for his young brother\r\nBenjamin (cf. the tribal data above). His father Jacob is invited to\r\ncome to Goshen, where a settlement is provided for the family and their\r\nflocks. This is followed many years later by the exodus, the conquest of\r\nPalestine, and the burial of Joseph's body in the grave at Shechem which\r\nhis father had bought.\r\n\r\n  The history of Joseph in Egypt displays some familiarity with the\r\n  circumstances and usages of that country; see Driver (Hastings's\r\n  _D.B._) and Cheyne (_Ency. Bib._, col. 2589 seq.); although Abrech\r\n  (xli. 43), possibly the Egyptian _ib rk_ (Crum, in Hastings's _D.B._,\r\n  i. 665), has been otherwise connected with the Assyrian _abarakku_ (a\r\n  high officer). An interesting parallel to the story of Joseph in Gen.\r\n  xxxix. is found in the Egyptian tale of _The Two Brothers_ (Petrie,\r\n  _Eg. Tales_, 2nd series, p. 36 seq., 1895), which dates from about\r\n  1500 B.C., but the differences are not inconsiderable compared with\r\n  the points of resemblance, and the tale has features which are almost\r\n  universal (Frazer, _Golden Bough_, 2nd ed., vol. iii. 351 seq.). On\r\n  the theory that the historical elements of Joseph's history refer to\r\n  an official (Yanhamu) of the time of Amenophis III. and IV., see\r\n  Cheyne, op. cit., and _Hibbert Journal_, October 1903. That the\r\n  present form of the narrative has been influenced by current\r\n  mythological lore is not improbable; on this question see (with\r\n  caution) Winckler, _Gesch. Israels_, ii. 67-77 (1900); A. Jeremias,\r\n  _Alte Test._, pp. 383 sqq. (1906). It may be added that the Egyptian\r\n  names in the story of Joseph are characteristic of the XXII. and\r\n  subsequent dynasties. See, also Meyer and Luther, _Die Israeliten_\r\n  (1906), Index, _s.v._     (S. A. C.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] Joseph's marriage with the daughter of the priest of On might\r\n    show that the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh were believed to be\r\n    half-Egyptian by descent, but it is notoriously difficult to\r\n    determine how much is of ethnological value and how much belongs to\r\n    romance (viz. that of the individual Joseph).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOSEPH, in the New Testament, the husband of Mary, the mother of Jesus.\r\nHe is represented as a descendant of the house of David, and his\r\ngenealogy appears in two divergent forms in Matt. i. 1-17 and Luke iii.\r\n23-38. The latter is probably much more complete and accurate in\r\ndetails. The former, obviously artificial in structure (notice 3 × 14\r\ngenerations), traces the Davidic descent through kings, and is governed\r\nby an apologetic purpose. Of Joseph's personal history practically\r\nnothing is recorded in the Bible. The facts concerning him common to the\r\ntwo birth-narratives (Matt. i.-ii.; Luke i.-ii.) are: (a) that he was a\r\ndescendant of David, (b) that Mary was already betrothed to him when she\r\nwas found with child of the Holy Ghost, and (c) that he lived at\r\nNazareth after the birth of Christ; but these facts are handled\r\ndifferently in each case. It is noticeable that, in Matthew, Joseph is\r\nprominent (e.g. he receives an annunciation from an angel), while in\r\nLuke's narrative he is completely subordinated. Bp Gore (_The\r\nIncarnation_, Bampton lecture for 1891, p. 78) points out that Matthew\r\nnarrates everything from Joseph's side, Luke from Mary's, and infers\r\nthat the narrative of the former may ultimately be based on Joseph's\r\naccount, that of the latter on Mary's. The narratives seem to have been\r\ncurrent (in a poetical form) among the early Jewish-Christian community\r\nof Palestine. At Nazareth Joseph followed the trade of a carpenter\r\n(Matt. xiii. 55). It is probable that he had died before the public\r\nministry of Christ; for no mention is made of him in passages relating\r\nto this period where the mother and brethren of Jesus are introduced;\r\nand from John xix. 26 it is clear that he was not alive at the time of\r\nthe Crucifixion.\r\n\r\nJoseph was the father of several children (Matt. xiii. 55), but\r\naccording to ecclesiastical tradition by a former marriage. The reading\r\nof Matt. i. 16, in the Sinaitic Palimpsest (_Joseph ... begat Jesus, who\r\nis called the Christ_) also makes him the natural father of Jesus, and\r\nthis was the view of certain early heretical sects, but it seems never\r\nto have been held in orthodox Christian circles. According to various\r\napocryphal gospels (conveniently collected in B. H. Cowper's _The\r\nApocryphal Gospels_, 1881), when married to Mary he was a widower\r\nalready 80 years of age, and the father of four sons and two daughters;\r\nhis first wife's name was Salome and she was a connexion of the family\r\nof John the Baptist.\r\n\r\nIn the Roman Catholic Church the 19th of March has since 1642 been a\r\nfeast in Joseph's honour. Two other festivals in his honour have also\r\nbeen established (the Patronage of St Joseph, 3rd Sunday after Easter,\r\nand the Betrothal of Mary and Joseph, 23rd of January). In December 1870\r\nSt Joseph was proclaimed Patron of the whole Church.     (G. H. Bo.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOSEPH OF ARIMATHAEA,[1] in the New Testament, a wealthy Jew who had\r\nbeen converted by Jesus Christ. He is mentioned by the Four Evangelists,\r\nwho are in substantial agreement concerning him: after the Crucifixion\r\nhe went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus, subsequently prepared\r\nit for burial and laid it in a tomb. There are, however, minor\r\ndifferences in the accounts, which have given rise to controversy.\r\nMatthew (xxvii. 60) says that the tomb was Joseph's own; Mark (xv. 43\r\nseq.), Luke (xxiii. 50 seq.) say nothing of this, while John (xix. 41)\r\nsimply says that the body was laid in a sepulchre \"nigh at hand.\" Both\r\nMark and Luke say that Joseph was a \"councillor\" ([Greek: euschêmôn\r\nbouleutês], Mark xv. 43), and the Gospel of Peter describes him as a\r\n\"friend of Pilate and of the Lord.\" This last statement is probably a\r\nlate invention, and there is considerable difficulty as to \"councillor.\"\r\nThat Joseph was a member of the Sanhedrin is improbable. Luke indeed,\r\nregarding him as such, says that he \"had not consented to their counsel\r\nand deed,\" but Mark (xiv. 64) says that _all_ the Sanhedrin \"condemned\r\nhim to be worthy of death.\" Perhaps the phrase \"noble councillor\" is\r\nintended to imply merely a man of wealth and position. Again Matthew\r\nsays that Joseph was a disciple, while Mark implies that he was not yet\r\namong the definite adherents of Christ, and John describes him as an\r\nadherent \"secretly for fear of the Jews.\" Most likely he was a disciple,\r\nbut belonged only to the wider circle of adherents. The account given in\r\nthe Fourth Gospel suggests that the writer, faced with these various\r\ndifficulties, assumed a double tradition: (1) that Joseph of Arimathaea,\r\na wealthy disciple, buried the body of Christ; (2) that the person in\r\nquestion was Joseph of Arimathaea a \"councillor,\" and solved the problem\r\nby substituting Nicodemus as the councillor; hence he describes both\r\nJoseph and Nicodemus (xix. 39) as co-operating in the burial. Some\r\ncritics (e.g. Strauss, _New Life of Jesus_, ch. 96) have thrown doubt\r\nupon the story, regarding some of the details as invented to suit the\r\nprophecy in Isa. liii. 9, \"they made his grave with the wicked, and with\r\nthe rich in his death\" (for various translations, see Hastings's _Dict.\r\nBible_, ii. 778). But in the absence of any reference to this prophecy\r\nin the Gospels, this view is unconvincing, though the correspondence is\r\nremarkable.\r\n\r\nThe striking character of this single appearance of Joseph of Arimathaea\r\nled to the rise of numerous legends. Thus William of Malmesbury says\r\nthat he was sent to Britain by St Philip, and, having received a small\r\nisland in Somersetshire, there constructed \"with twisted twigs\" the\r\nfirst Christian church in Britain--afterwards to become the Abbey of\r\nGlastonbury. The legend says that his staff, planted in the ground,\r\nbecame a thorn flowering twice a year (see GLASTONBURY). This\r\ntradition--which is given only as such by Malmesbury himself--is not\r\nconfirmed, and there is no mention of it in either Gildas or Bede.\r\nJoseph also plays a large part in the various versions of the Legend of\r\nthe Holy Grail (see GRAIL, THE HOLY).\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] Generally identified with Ramathaim-Zophim, the city of Elkanah\r\n    in the hilly district of Ephraim (1 Sam. i. 1), near Diospolis\r\n    (Lydda). See Euseb., _Onomasticon_, 225. 12.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOSEPH I. (1678-1711), Roman emperor, was the elder son of the emperor\r\nLeopold I. and his third wife, Eleanora, countess palatine, daughter of\r\nPhilip William of Neuburg. Born in Vienna on the 26th of July 1678, he\r\nwas educated strictly by Prince Dietrich Otto von Salm, and became a\r\ngood linguist. In 1687 he received the crown of Hungary, and he was\r\nelected king of the Romans in 1690. In 1699 he married Wilhelmina\r\nAmalia, daughter of Duke Frederick of Brunswick-Lüneburg, by whom he had\r\ntwo daughters. In 1702, on the outbreak of the War of the Spanish\r\nSuccession, he saw his only military service. He joined the imperial\r\ngeneral Louis of Baden in the siege of Landau. It is said that when he\r\nwas advised not to go into a place of danger he replied that those who\r\nwere afraid might retire. He succeeded his father as emperor in 1705,\r\nand it was his good fortune to govern the Austrian dominions, and to be\r\nhead of the Empire during the years in which his trusted general Prince\r\nEugène, either acting alone in Italy or with the duke of Marlborough in\r\nGermany and Flanders, was beating the armies of Louis XIV. During the\r\nwhole of his reign Hungary was disturbed by the conflict with Francis\r\nRáckóczy II., who eventually took refuge in France. The emperor did not\r\nhimself take the field against the rebels, but he is entitled to a large\r\nshare of the credit for the restoration of his authority. He reversed\r\nmany of the pedantically authoritative measures of his father, thus\r\nplacating all opponents who could be pacified, and he fought stoutly for\r\nwhat he believed to be his rights. Joseph showed himself very\r\nindependent towards the pope, and hostile to the Jesuits, by whom his\r\nfather had been much influenced. He had the tastes for art and music\r\nwhich were almost hereditary in his family, and was an active hunter. He\r\nbegan the attempts to settle the question of the Austrian inheritance by\r\na pragmatic sanction, which were continued by his brother Charles VI.\r\nJoseph died in Vienna on the 17th of April 1711, of small-pox.\r\n\r\n  See F. Krones von Marchland, _Grundriss der Oesterreichischen\r\n  Geschichte_ (1882); F. Wagner, _Historia Josephi Caesaris_ (1746); J.\r\n  C. Herchenhahn, _Geschichte der Regierung Kaiser Josephs I._\r\n  (1786-1789); C. van Noorden, _Europäische Geschichte im 18.\r\n  Jahrhundert_ (1870-1882).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOSEPH II. (1741-1790), Roman emperor, eldest son of the empress Maria\r\nTheresa and her husband Francis I., was born on the 13th of March 1741,\r\nin the first stress of the War of the Austrian Succession. Maria Theresa\r\ngave orders that he was only to be taught as if he were amusing himself;\r\nthe result was that he acquired a habit of crude and superficial study.\r\nHis real education was given him by the writings of Voltaire and the\r\nencyclopaedists, and by the example of Frederick the Great. His useful\r\ntraining was conferred by government officials, who were directed to\r\ninstruct him in the mechanical details of the administration of the\r\nnumerous states composing the Austrian dominions and the Empire. In 1761\r\nhe was made a member of the newly constituted council of state\r\n(_Staatsrath_) and began to draw up minutes, to which he gave the name\r\nof \"reveries,\" for his mother to read. These papers contain the germs of\r\nhis later policy, and of all the disasters which finally overtook him.\r\nHe was a friend to religious toleration, anxious to reduce the power of\r\nthe church, to relieve the peasantry of feudal burdens, and to remove\r\nrestrictions on trade and on knowledge. So far he did not differ from\r\nFrederick, Catherine of Russia or his own brother and successor Leopold\r\nII., all enlightened rulers of the 18th-century stamp. Where Joseph\r\ndiffered from great contemporary rulers, and where he was very close\r\nakin to the Jacobins, was in the fanatical intensity of his belief in\r\nthe power of the state when directed by reason, of his right to speak\r\nfor the state uncontrolled by laws, and of the reasonableness of his own\r\nreasons. Also he had inherited from his mother all the belief of the\r\nhouse of Austria in its \"august\" quality, and its claim to acquire\r\nwhatever it found desirable for its power or its profit. He was unable\r\nto understand that his philosophical plans for the moulding of mankind\r\ncould meet with pardonable opposition. The overweening character of the\r\nman was obvious to Frederick, who, after their first interview in 1769,\r\ndescribed him as ambitious, and as capable of setting the world on fire.\r\nThe French minister Vergennes, who met Joseph when he was travelling\r\nincognito in 1777, judged him to be \"ambitious and despotic.\"\r\n\r\nUntil the death of his mother in 1780 Joseph was never quite free to\r\nfollow his own instincts. After the death of his father in 1765 he\r\nbecame emperor and was made co-regent by his mother in the Austrian\r\ndominions. As emperor he had no real power, and his mother was resolved\r\nthat neither husband nor son should ever deprive her of sovereign\r\ncontrol in her hereditary dominions. Joseph, by threatening to resign\r\nhis place as co-regent, could induce his mother to abate her dislike to\r\nreligious toleration. He could, and he did, place a great strain on her\r\npatience and temper, as in the case of the first partition of Poland and\r\nthe Bavarian War of 1778, but in the last resort the empress spoke the\r\nfinal word. During these wars Joseph travelled much. He met Frederick\r\nthe Great privately at Neisse in 1769, and again at Mährisch-Neustadt in\r\n1770. On the second occasion he was accompanied by Prince Kaunitz, whose\r\nconversation with Frederick may be said to mark the starting-point of\r\nthe first partition of Poland. To this and to every other measure which\r\npromised to extend the dominions of his house Joseph gave hearty\r\napproval. Thus he was eager to enforce its claim on Bavaria upon the\r\ndeath of the elector Maximilian Joseph in 1777. In April of that year he\r\npaid a visit to his sister the queen of France (see MARIE ANTOINETTE),\r\ntravelling under the name of Count Falkenstein. He was well received,\r\nand much flattered by the encyclopaedists, but his observations led him\r\nto predict the approaching downfall of the French monarchy, and he was\r\nnot impressed favourably by the army or navy. In 1778 he commanded the\r\ntroops collected to oppose Frederick, who supported the rival claimant\r\nto Bavaria. Real fighting was averted by the unwillingness of Frederick\r\nto embark on a new war and by Maria Theresa's determination to maintain\r\npeace. In April 1780 he paid a visit to Catherine of Russia, against the\r\nwish of his mother.\r\n\r\nThe death of Maria Theresa on the 27th of November 1780 left Joseph\r\nfree. He immediately directed his government on a new course, full speed\r\nahead. He proceeded to attempt to realize his ideal of a wise despotism\r\nacting on a definite system for the good of all. The measures of\r\nemancipation of the peasantry which his mother had begun were carried on\r\nby him with feverish activity. The spread of education, the\r\nsecularization of church lands, the reduction of the religious orders\r\nand the clergy in general to complete submission to the lay state, the\r\npromotion of unity by the compulsory use of the German language,\r\neverything which from the point of view of 18th-century philosophy\r\nappeared \"reasonable\" was undertaken at once. He strove for\r\nadministrative unity with characteristic haste to reach results without\r\npreparation. His anti-clerical innovations induced Pope Pius VI. to pay\r\nhim a visit in July 1782. Joseph received the pope politely, and showed\r\nhimself a good Catholic, but refused to be influenced. So many\r\ninterferences with old customs began to produce unrest in all parts of\r\nhis dominions. Meanwhile he threw himself into a succession of foreign\r\npolicies all aimed at aggrandisement, and all equally calculated to\r\noffend his neighbours--all taken up with zeal, and dropped in\r\ndiscouragement. He endeavoured to get rid of the Barrier Treaty, which\r\ndebarred his Flemish subjects from the navigation of the Scheldt; when\r\nhe was opposed by France he turned to other schemes of alliance with\r\nRussia for the partition of Turkey and Venice. They also had to be given\r\nup in the face of the opposition of neighbours, and in particular of\r\nFrance. Then he resumed his attempts to obtain Bavaria--this time by\r\nexchanging it for Belgium--and only provoked the formation of the\r\n_Fürstenbund_ organized by the king of Prussia. Finally he joined Russia\r\nin an attempt to pillage Turkey. It began on his part by an unsuccessful\r\nand discreditable attempt to surprise Belgrade in time of peace, and was\r\nfollowed by the ill-managed campaign of 1788. He accompanied his army,\r\nbut showed no capacity for war. In November he returned to Vienna with\r\nruined health, and during 1789 was a dying man. The concentration of his\r\ntroops in the east gave the malcontents of Belgium an opportunity to\r\nrevolt. In Hungary the nobles were all but in open rebellion, and in his\r\nother states there were peasant risings, and a revival of particularist\r\nsentiments. Joseph was left entirely alone. His minister Kaunitz refused\r\nto visit his sick-room, and did not see him for two years. His brother\r\nLeopold remained at Florence. At last Joseph, worn out and\r\nbroken-hearted, recognized that his servants could not, or would not,\r\ncarry out his plans. On the 30th of January 1790 he formally withdrew\r\nall his reforms, and he died on the 20th of February.\r\n\r\nJoseph II. was twice married, first to Isabella, daughter of Philip,\r\nduke of Parma, to whom he was attached. After her death on the 27th of\r\nNovember 1763, a political marriage was arranged with Josepha (d. 1767),\r\ndaughter of Charles Albert, elector of Bavaria (the emperor Charles\r\nVII.). It proved extremely unhappy. Joseph left no children, and was\r\nsucceeded by his brother Leopold II.\r\n\r\n  Many volumes of the emperor's correspondence have been published.\r\n  Among them are _Maria Theresia und Joseph II. Ihre Korrespondenz samt\r\n  Briefen Josephs an seinen Bruder Leopold_ (1867-1868); _Joseph II. und\r\n  Leopold von Toskana.

As a boy he\r\nreceived a careful classical training, and in 1595 made an extended\r\njourney through Italy, returning to take up the career of arms. He\r\nserved at the siege of Amiens in 1597, and then accompanied a special\r\nembassy to London. In 1599 Baron de Mafflier, by which name he was known\r\nat court, renounced the world and entered the Capuchin monastery of\r\nOrleans. He embraced the religious life with great ardour, and became a\r\nnotable preacher and reformer. In 1606 he aided Antoinette d'Orléans, a\r\nnun of Fontevrault, to found the reformed order of the Filles du\r\nCalvaire, and wrote a manual of devotion for the nuns. His proselytizing\r\nzeal led him to send missionaries throughout the Huguenot centres--he\r\nhad become provincial of Touraine in 1613. He entered politics at the\r\nconferences of Loudun, when, as the confidant of the queen and the papal\r\nenvoy, he opposed the Gallican claims advanced by the parlement, which\r\nthe princes were upholding, and succeeded in convincing them of the\r\nschismatic tendency of Gallicanism. In 1612 he began those personal\r\nrelations with Richelieu which have indissolubly joined in history and\r\nlegend the cardinal and the \"Eminence grise,\" relations which research\r\nhas not altogether made clear. In 1627 the monk assisted at the siege of\r\nLa Rochelle. A purely religious reason also made him Richelieu's ally\r\nagainst the Habsburgs. He had a dream of arousing Europe to another\r\ncrusade against the Turks, and believed that the house of Austria was\r\nthe obstacle to that universal European peace which would make this\r\npossible. As Richelieu's agent, therefore, this modern Peter the Hermit\r\nmanoeuvred at the diet of Regensburg (1630) to thwart the aggression of\r\nthe emperor, and then advised the intervention of Gustavus Adolphus,\r\nreconciling himself to the use of Protestant armies by the theory that\r\none poison would counteract another. Thus the monk became a war\r\nminister, and, though maintaining a personal austerity of life, gave\r\nhimself up to diplomacy and politics. He died in 1638, just as the\r\ncardinalate was to be conferred upon him. The story that Richelieu\r\nvisited him when on his deathbed and roused the dying man by the words,\r\n\"Courage, Father Joseph, we have won Breisach,\" is apocryphal.\r\n\r\n  See Fagniez, _Le Père Joseph et Richelieu_ (1894), a work based\r\n  largely on original and unpublished sources. Father Joseph, according\r\n  to this biography, would seem not to have lectured Richelieu in the\r\n  fashion of the legends, whatever his moral influence may have been in\r\n  strengthening Richelieu's hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOSEPHINE (MARIE ROSE JOSEPHINE TASCHER DE LA PAGERIE) (1763-1814),\r\nempress of the French, was born in the island of Martinique on the 23rd\r\nof June 1763, being the eldest of three daughters of Joseph Tascher de\r\nla Pagerie, lieutenant of artillery. Her beauty and grace, though of a\r\nlanguid Creole style, won the affections of the young officer the\r\nvicomte de Beauharnais, and, after some family complications, she was\r\nmarried to him. Their married life was not wholly happy, the frivolity\r\nof Josephine occasioning her husband anxiety and jealousy. Two children,\r\nEugène and Hortense, were the fruit of the union. During Josephine's\r\nsecond residence in Martinique, whither she proceeded to tend her\r\nmother, occurred the first troubles with the slaves, which resulted from\r\nthe precipitate action of the constituent assembly in emancipating them.\r\nShe returned to her husband, who at that time entered into political\r\nlife at Paris. Her beauty and vivacity won her many admirers in the\r\nsalons of the capital. As the Revolution ran its course her husband, as\r\nan ex-noble, incurred the suspicion and hostility of the Jacobins; and\r\nhis ill-success at the head of a French army on the Rhine led to his\r\narrest and execution. Thereafter Josephine was in a position of much\r\nperplexity and some hardship, but the friendship of Barras and of Madame\r\nTallien, to both of whom she was then much attached, brought her into\r\nnotice, and she was one of the queens of Parisian society in the year\r\n1795, when Napoleon Bonaparte's services to the French convention in\r\nscattering the malcontents of the capital (13 Vendémiaire, or October 5,\r\n1795) brought him to the front. There is a story that she became known\r\nto Napoleon through a visit paid to him by her son Eugène in order to\r\nbeg his help in procuring the restoration of his father's sword, but it\r\nrests on slender foundations. In any case, it is certain that Bonaparte,\r\nhowever he came to know her, was speedily captivated by her charms. She,\r\non her side, felt very little affection for the thin, impecunious and\r\nirrepressible suitor; but by degrees she came to acquiesce in the\r\nthought of marriage, her hesitations, it is said, being removed by the\r\ninfluence of Barras and by the nomination of Bonaparte to the command of\r\nthe army of Italy. The civil marriage took place on the 9th of March\r\n1796, two days before the bridegroom set out for his command. He failed\r\nto induce her to go with him to Nice and Italy.\r\n\r\nBonaparte's letters to Josephine during the campaign reveal the ardour\r\nof his love, while she rarely answered them. As he came to realize her\r\nshallowness and frivolity his passion cooled; but at the time when he\r\nresided at Montebello (near Milan) in 1797 he still showed great regard\r\nfor her. During his absence in Egypt in 1798-1799, her relations to an\r\nofficer, M. Charles, were most compromising; and Bonaparte on his return\r\nthought of divorcing her. Her tears and the entreaties of Eugène and\r\nHortense availed to bring about a reconciliation; and during the period\r\nof the consulate (1799-1804) their relations were on the whole happy,\r\nthough Napoleon's conduct now gave his consort grave cause for concern.\r\nHis brothers and sisters more than once begged him to divorce Josephine,\r\nand it is known that, from the time when he became first consul for\r\nlife (August 1802) with large powers over the choice of a successor, he\r\nkept open the alternative of a divorce. Josephine's anxieties increased\r\non the proclamation of the Empire (May 18, 1804); and on the 1st of\r\nDecember 1804, the eve of the coronation at Notre Dame, she gained her\r\nwish that she should be married anew to Napoleon with religious rites.\r\nDespite her care, the emperor procured the omission of one formality,\r\nthe presence of the parish priest; but at the coronation scene Josephine\r\nappeared radiant with triumph over her envious relatives. The august\r\nmarriages contracted by her children Eugène and Hortense seemed to\r\nestablish her position; but her ceaseless extravagance and, above all,\r\nthe impossibility that she should bear a son strained the relations\r\nbetween Napoleon and Josephine. She complained of his infidelities and\r\ngrowing callousness. The end came in sight after the campaign of 1809,\r\nwhen Napoleon caused the announcement to be made to her that reasons of\r\nstate compelled him to divorce her. Despite all her pleadings he held to\r\nhis resolve. The most was made of the slight technical irregularity at\r\nthe marriage ceremony of the 1st of December 1804; and the marriage was\r\ndeclared null and void.\r\n\r\nAt her private retreat, La Malmaison, near Paris, which she had\r\nbeautified with curios and rare plants and flowers, Josephine closed her\r\nlife in dignified retirement. Napoleon more than once came to consult\r\nher upon matters in which he valued her tact and good sense. Her health\r\ndeclined early in 1814, and after his first abdication (April 11, 1814)\r\nit was clear that her end was not far off. The emperor Alexander of\r\nRussia and Frederick William III. of Prussia, then in Paris, requested\r\nan interview with her. She died on the 24th of May 1814. Her friends,\r\nMme de Rémusat and others, pointed out that Napoleon's good fortune\r\ndeserted him after the divorce; and it is certain that the Austrian\r\nmarriage clogged him in several ways. Josephine's influence was used on\r\nbehalf of peace and moderation both in internal and in foreign affairs.\r\nThus she begged Napoleon not to execute the duc d'Enghien and not to\r\nembroil himself in Spanish affairs in 1808.\r\n\r\n  See M.

R.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOSEPHUS, FLAVIUS (c. 37-c. 95?), Jewish historian and military\r\ncommander, was born in the first year of Caligula (37-38). His father\r\nbelonged to one of the noblest priestly families, and through his mother\r\nhe claimed descent from the Asmonaean high priest Jonathan. A precocious\r\nstudent of the Law, he made trial of the three sects of\r\nJudaism--Pharisees, Sadducees and Essenes--before he reached the age of\r\nnineteen. Then, having spent three years in the desert with the hermit\r\nBanus, who was presumably an Essene, he became a Pharisee. In 64 he went\r\nto Rome to intercede on behalf of some priests, his friends, whom the\r\nprocurator Felix had sent to render account to Caesar for some\r\ninsignificant offence. Making friends with Alityrus, a Jewish actor, who\r\nwas a favourite of Nero, Josephus obtained an introduction to the\r\nempress Poppaea and effected his purpose by her help. His visit to Rome\r\nenabled him to speak from personal experience of the power of the\r\nEmpire, when he expostulated with the revolutionary Jews on his return\r\nto Palestine. But they refused to listen; and he, with all the Jews who\r\ndid not fly the country, was dragged into the great rebellion of 66. In\r\ncompany with two other priests, Josephus was sent to Galilee under\r\norders (he says) to persuade the ill-affected to lay down their arms and\r\nreturn to the Roman allegiance, which the Jewish aristocracy had not yet\r\nrenounced. Having sent his two companions back to Jerusalem, he\r\norganized the forces at his disposal, and made arrangements for the\r\ngovernment of his province. His obvious desire to preserve law and order\r\nexcited the hostility of John of Giscala, who endeavoured vainly to\r\nremove him as a traitor to the national cause by inciting the Galileans\r\nto kill him and by persuading the Sanhedrin at Jerusalem to recall him.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 67 the Jewish troops, whom Josephus had drilled so\r\nsedulously, fled before the Roman forces of Vespasian and Titus. He sent\r\nto Jerusalem for reinforcements, but none came. With the stragglers who\r\nremained, he held a stronghold against the Romans by dint of his native\r\ncunning, and finally, when the place was taken, persuaded forty men, who\r\nshared his hiding-place, to kill one another in turn rather than commit\r\nsuicide. They agreed to cast lots, on the understanding that the second\r\nshould kill the first and so on. Josephus providentially drew the last\r\nlot and prevailed upon his destined victim to live. Their companions\r\nwere all dead in accordance with the compact; but Josephus at any rate\r\nsurvived and surrendered. Being led before Vespasian, he was inspired to\r\nprophesy that Vespasian would become emperor. In consequence of the\r\nprophecy his life was spared, but he was kept close prisoner for two\r\nyears. When his prophecy was fulfilled he was liberated, assumed the\r\nname of Flavius, the family name of Vespasian, and accompanied his\r\npatron to Alexandria. There he took another wife, as the Jewess allotted\r\nhim by Vespasian after the fall of Caesarea had forsaken him, and\r\nreturned to attend Titus and to act as intermediary between him and the\r\nJews who still held Jerusalem. His efforts in this capacity failed; but\r\nwhen the city was stormed (70) Titus granted him whatever boon he might\r\nask. So he secured the lives of some free men who had been taken and (by\r\nthe gift of Titus) certain sacred books. After this he repaired to Rome\r\nand received one of the pensions, which Vespasian (according to\r\nSuetonius) was the first to bestow upon Latin and Greek writers. He was\r\nalso made a Roman citizen and received an estate in Judaea.\r\nThenceforward he devoted himself to literary work under the patronage of\r\nVespasian, Titus and Domitian. As he mentions the death of Agrippa II.\r\nit is probable that he lived into the 2nd century; but the date of\r\nAgrippa's death has been challenged and, if his patron Epaphroditus may\r\nbe identified with Nero's freedman, it is possible that Josephus may\r\nhave been involved in his fall and perished under Domitian in 95.\r\n\r\n  WORKS.--1. _The Jewish War_ ([Greek: Peri tou Ioudaïkou polemou]), the\r\n  oldest of Josephus' extant writings, was written towards the end of\r\n  Vespasian's reign (69-79). The Aramaic original has not been\r\n  preserved; but the Greek version was prepared by Josephus himself in\r\n  conjunction with competent Greek scholars. Its purpose in all\r\n  probability was, in the first instance, to exhibit to the Babylonian\r\n  Jews the overwhelming power of Rome and so to deter them from\r\n  repeating the futile revolt of the Jews of Palestine. Of its seven\r\n  books, the first two survey the history of the Jews from the capture\r\n  of Jerusalem by Antiochus Epiphanes to the outbreak of war in 67, and\r\n  here Josephus relies upon some such general history as that of\r\n  Nicolaus of Damascus. The rest deals with the events of the war\r\n  (67-73) which fell more or less within his own knowledge. Vespasian,\r\n  Titus and Agrippa II. testified (he tells us) to his accuracy.\r\n  Representatives of the Zealots would probably have protested against\r\n  his pro-Roman prejudices.\r\n\r\n  2. _The Jewish Antiquities_ ([Greek: Ioudaïkê Archaiologia]) covers in\r\n  twenty books the history of the Jews from the creation of the world to\r\n  the outbreak of the war with Rome. It was finished in the thirteenth\r\n  year of Domitian (93). Its purpose was to glorify the Jewish nation in\r\n  the eyes of the Roman world. In the part covered by the books of the\r\n  Bible Josephus follows them, and that mainly, if not entirely as they\r\n  are translated into Greek by the Seventy (the Septuagint version).\r\n  Being a Pharisee, he sometimes introduces traditions of the Elders,\r\n  which are either inferences from, or embroideries of, the biblical\r\n  narrative. Sometimes, also, he gives proof of some knowledge of Hebrew\r\n  and supplements his scriptural authorities, which include 1 Esdras,\r\n  from general Greek histories. For the later period he uses the Greek\r\n  Esther, with its additions, 1 Maccabees, Polybius, Strabo and Nicolaus\r\n  of Damascus. But towards the end he confesses that he has grown weary\r\n  of his task, and his history becomes meagre. The work contains\r\n  accounts of John the Baptist and Jesus, which may account for the fact\r\n  that Josephus' writings were rescued from oblivion by the Christians.\r\n  But the description of Jesus as \"a wise man, if indeed one should call\r\n  him a man,\" can hardly be genuine, and the assertion \"this was the\r\n  Christ\" is equally doubtful, unless it be assumed that the Greek word\r\n  _Christos_ had become technical in the sense of false-Christ or\r\n  false-prophet among non-Christian Jews.\r\n\r\n  3. Josephus wrote a narrative of his own _Life_ in order to defend\r\n  himself against the accusation brought by his enemy Justus of Tiberias\r\n  to the effect that he had really been the cause of the Jewish\r\n  rebellion. In his defence Josephus departs from the facts as narrated\r\n  in the _Jewish War_ and represents himself as a partisan of Rome and,\r\n  therefore, as a traitor to his own people from the beginning.\r\n\r\n  4. The two books _Against Apion_ are a defence or apology directed\r\n  against current misrepresentations of the Jews. Earlier titles are\r\n  _Concerning the Antiquity of the Jews_ or _Against the Greeks_. Apion\r\n  was the leader of the Alexandrine embassy which opposed Philo and his\r\n  companions when they appeared in behalf of the Alexandrine Jews before\r\n  Caligula. The defence which Josephus puts forward has a permanent\r\n  value and shows him at his best.\r\n\r\n  The Greek text of Josephus' works has been edited with full collection\r\n  of different readings by B. Niese (Berlin, 1887-1895). The Teubner\r\n  text by Naber is based on this. The translation into English of W.\r\n  Whiston has been (superficially) revised by A. R. Shilleto\r\n  (1889-1890). Schürer (_History of the Jewish People_) gives a full\r\n  bibliography.     (J. H. A. H.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOSHEKAN, a small province of Persia covering about 1000 sq. m. Pop.\r\nabout 5000. It has a yearly revenue of about £1200, and is held in fief\r\nby the family of Bahram Mirza, Muizz ed Dowleh (d. 1882). Its chief town\r\nand the residence of the governor used to be Joshekan-Kali, a large\r\nvillage with fine gardens, formerly famous for its carpets (_kali_), but\r\nnow the chief place is Maimeh, a little city with a population of 2500,\r\nsituated at an elevation of 6670 ft., about 63 m. from Isfahan in a\r\nnorth-westerly direction and 13 m. south-west of Joshekan-Kali.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOSHUA, BOOK OF, the sixth book of the Old Testament, and the first of\r\nthe group known as the \"Former Prophets.\" It takes its name from\r\nJoshua[1] the son of Nun, an Ephraimite who, on the death of Moses,\r\nassumed the leadership to which he had previously been designated by his\r\nchief (Deut. xxxi. 14 seq., 23), and proceeded to the conquest of the\r\nland of Canaan. The book differs from the Pentateuch or Torah in the\r\nabsence of legal matter, and in its intimate connexion with the\r\nnarrative in the books which follow. It is, however, the proper sequel\r\nto the origins of the people as related in Genesis, to the exodus of the\r\nIsraelite tribes from Egypt, and their journeyings in the wilderness. On\r\nthese and also on literary grounds it is often convenient to class the\r\nfirst six books of the Bible as a unit under the term \"Hexateuch.\" For\r\nan exhaustive detailed study has revealed many signs of diversity of\r\nauthorship which combine to show that the book is due to the\r\nincorporation of older material in two main redactions; one deeply\r\nimbued with the language and thought of Deuteronomy itself (D), the\r\nother of the post-exilic priestly circle (P) which gave the Pentateuch\r\nits present form. That the older sources (which often prove to be\r\ncomposite) are actually identical with the Yahwist or Judaean (J) and\r\nthe Elohist or Ephraimite (E) narratives (on which see GENESIS) is not\r\nimprobable, though, especially as regards the former, still very\r\nuncertain. In general the literary problems are exceedingly intricate,\r\nand no attempt can be made here to deal with them as fully as they\r\ndeserve.\r\n\r\n_The Invasion._--The book falls naturally into two main parts, of which\r\nthe first, the crossing of the Jordan and the conquest of Palestine\r\n(i.-xii.) is mainly due to Deuteronomic compilers. It opens with the\r\npreparations for the crossing of the Jordan and the capture of the\r\npowerful city Jericho. Ai, near Bethel, is taken after a temporary\r\nrepulse, and Joshua proceeds to erect an altar upon Mt Ebal (north of\r\nShechem). For the fullness with which the events are recorded the\r\nwriters were probably indebted to local stories.\r\n\r\n  The Israelites are at Abel-Shittim (already reached in Num. xxv. 1).\r\n  Moses is dead, and Joshua enters upon his task with the help of the\r\n  Transjordanic tribes who have already received their territory (i).\r\n  The narrative is of the later prophetic stamp (D; cf. Deut. iii.\r\n  18-22, xi. 24, where Moses is the speaker; xxxi. 1-8), but may be\r\n  based upon an earlier and shorter record (E; vv. 1 seq., 10, 11a). Of\r\n  the mission of the spies to Jericho, two versions were current\r\n  (duplicates ii. 3, 12, 18; v. 15 seq. breaks the connexion between vv.\r\n  13 and 18, but is resumed in vv. 22-24); D's addition is to be\r\n  recognized in ii. 9b-11. The incident occupies at least four days, but\r\n  the main narrative reckons three days between i. 11 and iii. 2. Next\r\n  follow the passage of the Jordan (commemorated by the erection of\r\n  twelve stones), the encampment at Gilgal, and the observance of the\r\n  rite of circumcision and of the passover (iii.-v.). The complicated\r\n  narrative in iii.-iv. is of composite origin (contrast iii. 17 with\r\n  iv. 10 seq., 19; iv. 3, 8 with vv. 9, 20; and cf. iii. 12 with the\r\n  superfluous iv. 2, &c.). As in ii., D has amplified (iii. 4b, 7, 10b,\r\n  iv. 9-10a, 12, 14; more prominently in iv. 21-v. 1, v. 4-8), and\r\n  subsequently P (or a hand akin to P) has worked over the whole (iii.\r\n  4, note the number and the prohibition, cf. Num. i. 51; iii. 8, 15\r\n  seq.; iv. 13, 19; v. 10-12). Circumcision, already familiar from Exod.\r\n  iv. 26, Deut. x. 16, is here regarded as a new rite (v. 2, 9,\r\n  supplemented by vv. 1, 4-8), but the conflicting views have been\r\n  harmonized by the words \"the second time\" (v. 2). Gilgal is thus named\r\n  from the \"rolling away\" of the \"reproach of Egypt\" (v. 9), but iv. 20\r\n  suggests a different origin, viz. the sacred stone-circle (cf. Judges\r\n  iii. 19, R.V. marg.). An older account of the divine commission to\r\n  Joshua appears in the archaic passage v. 13-15 (cf. Moses in Exod.\r\n  iii.). Fusion of sources is obvious in the story of the fall of\r\n  Jericho (contrast vi. 5 and v. 10, vv. 21 and 24, vv. 22 and 25);\r\n  according to one (E?) the people march seven times round the city on\r\n  one day, the ark and the priests occupying a prominent position (vi.\r\n  4-6, 7b-9, 12 seq., 16a, 20 [part], 22-24); but in the other they\r\n  march every day for seven days. Both here and in the preceding\r\n  chapters the Septuagint has several variations and omissions, due\r\n  either to an (unsuccessful) attempt to simplify the present\r\n  difficulties, or to the use of another recension. The curse pronounced\r\n  by Joshua upon the destroyed city of Jericho (vi. 26) should be\r\n  associated with an incident in the reign of Ahab which is acquainted\r\n  with the story (1 Kings xvi. 34); the city, however, reappears in\r\n  Joshua xviii. 21; 2 Sam. x. 5. Achan's sacrilege, the cause of the\r\n  repulse at Ai and of the naming of the valley of Achor (vii.), is\r\n  introduced by vi. 18 seq., 24b, and, as its spirit shows, is of\r\n  relatively later date. It contains some probable traces of D (in vii.\r\n  5, 7, 11 seq., 15, 25) and P (in vv. 1, 18, 24 seq.). The capture of\r\n  Ai has marks of the same dual origin as the preceding chapters (cf.\r\n  viii. 3a with 10, and contrast viii. 3-9 with v. 12; vv. 5-7 with 18,\r\n  26; v. 19 with 28). The general resemblance between chs. vii.-viii.\r\n  and the war with Benjamin (Judges xx.) should be noticed.\r\n\r\n_Conquests in Palestine._--The erection of the altar, not at the scene\r\nof battle (cf. 1 Sam. xiv. 35) but on Mt Ebal (viii. 30-35, D),\r\npresupposes the conquest of central Palestine and the removal of the ark\r\nfrom Gilgal. These, however, are not narrated, and, unless some account\r\nof them has been replaced by the present passage, this portion of the\r\nconquest was ignored. Possibly the passage is not in its original\r\nposition: in the Septuagint it appears after ix. 2, while Josephus\r\n(_Ant._ v. 1, 19) and the Samaritan book of Joshua read it before ch.\r\nxiii.; Dillmann, however, would place it after xi. 23. The capture of\r\nJericho and Ai is followed by the successful stratagem of the Gibeonites\r\nto make peace with Israel (ix.). This involves them in a war with the\r\nsouthern Canaanites; Joshua intervenes and obtains a crowning victory\r\n(x.). The camp is still at Gilgal. A similar conquest of the northern\r\nCanaanites follows (xi.), and the first part of the book concludes with\r\na summary of the results of the Israelite invasion (xii.).\r\n\r\n  No satisfactory explanation of viii. 30-35 has been found, yet ix. 1\r\n  seq. seems to show that it was the prelude to the Canaanite wars. In\r\n  contrast to the absence of any reference to the occupation of central\r\n  Palestine, the conquest of the south was current in several divergent\r\n  traditions. Two records are blended in ix.; one narrates the covenant\r\n  with the Gibeonites, the other that with the Hivites (properly\r\n  Hivvites); and in the latter Joshua has no place (vv. 4 seq., 6b, 7,\r\n  11-14, &c.). The former has additions by D (vv. 9b, 10, 24 seq.) and\r\n  by P (v. 15 last clause, 17-21); the latter, in accordance with the\r\n  legislation of its day (posterior to Ezek. xliv. 6 sqq.), does not\r\n  allow the Gibeonites to minister to the temple or altar, but merely to\r\n  the \"congregation,\" a characteristic post-exilic term (contrast vv. 21\r\n  and 23; and on 27 see Sept. and commentaries). The story of the\r\n  covenant conflicts with the notice that Gibeon was still an\r\n  independent Canaanite city in David's time (2 Sam. xxi. 2). The defeat\r\n  of the southern coalition is based, as the doublets show, upon two\r\n  sources; the war arises from two causes (vengeance upon the\r\n  Gibeonites, and the attempt to overthrow Israel), and concludes with a\r\n  twofold victory: in x. 16-24 the kings are pursued to Makkedah and\r\n  slain, in v. 11 they are smitten by a great hailstorm in their flight\r\n  to Azekah (cf. 1 Sam. vii. 10, xiv. 15, in the same district).\r\n  Redactional links have been added, apparently by D, to whom is\r\n  possibly due the stanza quoted from the book of Jashar (v. 12 seq.), a\r\n  poetical address to the sun and moon, of the nature of a prayer or\r\n  spell for their aid (cf. Judges v. 20, and see Ecclus. xlvi. 4). The\r\n  literal interpretation of this picturesque quotation has been\r\n  influenced by the prosaic comments at the end of v. 13 and beginning\r\n  of v. 14. Verse 15, which closes the account, anticipates v. 43; the\r\n  Septuagint omits both. The generalizing narrative (x. 28-43), which is\r\n  due to D in its present form, is partly based upon old matter (e.g.\r\n  the capture of Makkedah), but is inconsistent with what precedes (v.\r\n  37, see v. 23 sqq.) and follows (capture of Debir, v. 38 seq., see xv.\r\n  15; Judges i. 11). The description of the conquest of the northern\r\n  Canaanites is very similar to that of the south. The main part is from\r\n  an older source (xi. 1, 4-9; see DEBORAH), the amplifications (v. 2\r\n  seq.) are due to D, as also are the summary (vv. 10-23, cf. style of\r\n  x. 28-43), and the enumeration of the total results of the invasion\r\n  (xii.), which includes names not previously mentioned.\r\n\r\n_Division of the Land._--The result of the events narrated in the first\r\npart of the book is to ascribe the entire subjugation of Canaan to\r\nJoshua, whose centre was at Gilgal (x. 15, 43). He is now \"old and\r\nadvanced in years,\" and although much outlying land remained to be\r\npossessed, he is instructed to divide the conquered districts among the\r\nwestern tribes (xiii. 1 sqq.). This is detailed at length in the second\r\npart of the book. With the completion of the division his mission is\r\naccomplished. The main body of this part (xiii. 15-xiv. 5; xv.-xvii.;\r\nxviii. 11-xxi. 42; xxii. 7-34) is in its present form almost entirely\r\ndue to P.\r\n\r\n  In regard to details, xiii. 2-6 (now D) expresses the view that the\r\n  conquest was incomplete, and numbers districts chiefly in the\r\n  south-west and in the Lebanon. Two sources deal with the inheritance\r\n  of the east Jordan tribes in terms which are--(a) general (xiii. 8-12,\r\n  D), and (b) precise (vv. 15-32, P). The latter stands between the\r\n  duplicate passages xiii. 14 and 32 seq. (see the Sept.). With the\r\n  interest taken in these tribes, cf. for (a) i. 12-18; Deut. iii.\r\n  12-22, and the sequel in Joshua xxii. 1-6; and for (b) xxii. 9 seq.;\r\n  Num. xxxii. P's account of the division opens with an introductory\r\n  notice of the manner in which Eleazar the priest and Joshua (note the\r\n  order) prepare to complete the work which Moses had begun (xiv. 1-5).\r\n  It opens with Judah, its borders (xv. 1-12) and cities (vv. 20-62),\r\n  and continues with the two Joseph tribes, Ephraim (xvi. 4-9, contrast\r\n  details in vv. 1-3) and Manasseh (xvii. 1-10, cf. Num. xxvi. 30-32,\r\n  xxvii. 1-11; P). There is now a break in the narrative (xviii. 2-10,\r\n  source uncertain); seven tribes have not yet received an inheritance,\r\n  and Joshua (alone) encourages them to send three men from each tribe\r\n  to walk through the land--excluding the territory of Judah and\r\n  Joseph--and to bring a description of it to him, after which he\r\n  divides it among them by lot. P[2] now resumes with an account of the\r\n  borders and cities of Benjamin (xviii. 11-28), Simeon, Zebulun,\r\n  Issachar, Asher, Naphtali and Dan (xix.; on v. 47, see below); and,\r\n  after the subscription (xix. 51), concludes with the institution of\r\n  the cities of refuge (xx., cf. Num. xxxv.), and of the Levitical\r\n  cities (xxi., contrast the earlier brief notice, xiii. 14, 33).\r\n  Chapter xx., belonging to the Predaction, has certain points of\r\n  contact with Deut. xix. which, it is very important to observe, are\r\n  wanting in the Septuagint; and xxi. 43-45 closes D's account of the\r\n  division, and in the Septuagint contains matter most of which is now\r\n  given by P in xix. 49 seq. Two narratives describe the dismissal of\r\n  the trans-Jordanic tribes after their co-operation in the conquest,\r\n  viz. xxii. 1-6 (D), and xxii. 9 seq. (P); cf. above, on xiii. 8 seq.\r\n  P, with the description of the erection of the altar (v. 34, Gilead?;\r\n  cf. Gen. xxxi. 47 seq.), is apparently a late re-writing of some now\r\n  obscure incident to emphasize the unity of worship. P's account of the\r\n  distribution of land among the _nine and a half_ tribes by Eleazar and\r\n  Joshua (from xiv. 1-5 to xix. 51) appears to have been on the lines\r\n  laid down in Num. xxxiv. (P). The scene, according to xviii. 1, is\r\n  Shiloh, and this verse, which does not belong to the context, should\r\n  apparently precede P's narrative in xiv. 1. But of the occupation of\r\n  _Shiloh_, the famous Ephraimite sanctuary and the seat of the ark, we\r\n  have no information. The older source, however, presupposes that Judah\r\n  and the two Joseph tribes have acquired their territory; the remaining\r\n  seven are blamed for their indifference (xviii. 2-10, see above), and\r\n  receive their lot conjointly at the camp at Shiloh. But if the\r\n  location is an attempt to harmonize with xviii. 1, _Gilgal_ should\r\n  probably be restored. The section xviii. 2-10 is followed by xxi. 43\r\n  seq. (above), and may have been preceded originally by xiii. 1, 7\r\n  (where read: inheritance for the _seven_ tribes); in its present form\r\n  it appears to be due to D. Another account of the exploits of Judah\r\n  and Joseph can be traced here and there; e.g. in xiv. 6-15 (where\r\n  Caleb receives Hebron as his inheritance and the \"land had rest from\r\n  war\"), and xvii. 14-18 (where Joseph receives an additional lot); but\r\n  where these traditions have not been worked into later narratives,\r\n  they exist only in fragmentary form and are chiefly recognizable by\r\n  their standpoint. They are characterized by the view that the conquest\r\n  was only a partial one, and one which was neither the work of a single\r\n  man nor at his instigation, but due entirely to individual or tribal\r\n  achievements. This view can be traced in xiii. 13, xv. 63 (cf. the\r\n  parallel Judges i. 21 in contrast to v. 8), xvi. 10 (Judges i. 29),\r\n  xvii. 11-13 (Judges i. 27 seq.), and in the references to separate\r\n  tribal or family exploits: xv. 13-19, xix. 47 (cf. Judges i. 34 seq.,\r\n  xviii.).\r\n\r\nTwo closing addresses are ascribed to Joshua, one an exhortation similar\r\nto the homilies in secondary portions of Deuteronomy (xxiii.; cf. Moses\r\nin Deut. xxviii. seq., and Samuel's last address in 1 Sam. xii.), which\r\nvirtually excludes the other (xxiv.), where Joshua assembles the tribes\r\nat Shechem (Shiloh, in the Septuagint) and passes under review the\r\nhistory of Israel from the days of heathenism (before Abraham was\r\nbrought into Canaan) down through the oppression in Egypt, the exodus,\r\nthe conquest in East Jordan and the occupation of Canaan. A few\r\notherwise unknown details are to be found (xxiv. 2, 11 seq. 14). The\r\naddress (which is extremely important for its representation of the\r\nreligious conditions) is made the occasion for a solemn covenant whereby\r\nthe people agree to cleave to Yahweh alone. This is commemorated by the\r\nerection of a stone under the oak by the sanctuary of Yahweh (for the\r\ntree with its sacred pillar, see Gen. xxxv. 4; Judges ix. 6). The people\r\nare then dismissed, and the book closes in ordinary narrative style with\r\nthe death of Joshua and his burial in his inheritance at Timnath-serah\r\nin Mt Ephraim (cf. xix. 49 seq.); the burial of Joseph in Shechem; and\r\nthe death and burial of Eleazar the son of Aaron in the \"hill of\r\nPhinehas.\"\r\n\r\n  Chapter xxiv. presupposes the complete subjection of the Canaanites\r\n  and is of a late prophetic stamp. Some signs of amplification (e.g.\r\n  vv. 11b, 13, 31) suggest that it was inserted by a Deuteronomic hand,\r\n  evidently distinct from the author of xxiii. But elsewhere there are\r\n  traces of secondary Deuteronomic expansion and of internal\r\n  incongruities in Deuteronomic narratives; contrast xiv. 6-15 with\r\n  Joshua's extermination of the \"Anakim\" in xi. 21 seq.; the use of this\r\n  name with the \"Philistines\" of xiii. 2 (see PHILISTINES), or the\r\n  conquests in xi. 16-22 with the names in x. 36-43. All these passages\r\n  are now due to D; but not only is Deuteronomy itself composite, a\r\n  twofold redaction can be traced in Judges, Samuel and Kings, thus\r\n  involving the deeper literary problems of Joshua with the historical\r\n  books generally.[3] Both Joshua xxiii. and xxiv. are closely connected\r\n  with the very complicated introduction to the era of the \"judges\" in\r\n  Judges ii. 6 sqq., and ii. 6-9 actually resume Joshua xxiv. 28 sqq.,\r\n  while the Septuagint appends to the close of Joshua the beginning of\r\n  the story of Ehud (Judges iii. 12 seq.). Both Judges i.-ii. 5 and\r\n  chap. xvii.-xxi. are of post-Deuteronomic insertion, and they\r\n  represent conditions analogous to the older notices imbedded in the\r\n  later work of P (Judges i. 21, xix. 10-12, cf. Joshua xv. 63; see\r\n  JUDGES _ad fin._). Moreover, P in its turn shows elsewhere definite\r\n  indications of different periods and standpoints, and the fluid state\r\n  of the book at a late age is shown by the presence of Deuteronomic\r\n  elements in Joshua xx., not found in the Septuagint, and by the\r\n  numerous and often striking readings which the latter recension\r\n  presents.\r\n\r\n_Value of the Book._--The value of the book of Joshua is primarily\r\nreligious; its fervency, its conviction of the destiny of Israel and its\r\ninculcation of the unity and greatness of the God of Israel give\r\nexpression to the philosophy of Israelite historians. As an historical\r\nrecord its value must depend upon a careful criticism of its contents in\r\nthe light of biblical history and external information. Its description\r\nof the conquest of Canaan comes from an age when the event was a shadow\r\nof the past. It is an ideal view of the manner in which a divinely\r\nappointed leader guided a united people into the promised land of their\r\nancestors, and, after a few brief wars of extermination (x.-xii.), died\r\nleaving the people in quiet possession of their new inheritance (xi. 23;\r\nxxi. 44 seq.; xxiii. 1).[4] On the other hand, the earlier inhabitants\r\nwere not finally subjugated until Solomon's reign (1 Kings ix. 20);\r\nJerusalem was taken by David from the Jebusites (2 Sam. v.); and several\r\nsites in its neighbourhood, together with important fortresses like\r\nGezer, Megiddo and Taanach, were not held by Israel at the first. There\r\nare traces of other conflicting traditions representing independent\r\ntribal efforts which were not successful, and the Israelites are even\r\nsaid to live in the midst of Canaanites, intermarrying with them and\r\nadopting their cult (Judges i.-iii. 6). From a careful consideration of\r\nall the evidence, both internal and external, biblical scholars are now\r\nalmost unanimous that the more finished picture of the Israelite\r\ninvasion and settlement cannot be accepted as a historical record for\r\nthe age. It accords with this that the elaborate tribal-lists and\r\nboundaries prove to be of greater value for the geography than for the\r\nhistory of Palestine, and the attempts to use them as evidence for the\r\nearly history of Israel have involved numerous additional difficulties\r\nand confusion.[5]\r\n\r\nThe book of Joshua has ascribed to one man conquests which are not\r\nconfirmed by subsequent history. The capture of Bethel, implied rather\r\nthan described in Joshua viii., is elsewhere the work of the Joseph\r\ntribes (Judges i. 22 sqq., cf. features in the conquest of Jericho,\r\nJoshua vi. 25). Joshua's victory in north Palestine has its parallel in\r\nJudges iv. at another period (see DEBORAH), and Adoni-zedek of Jerusalem\r\n(Joshua x.) can scarcely be severed from the Adoni-bezek taken by the\r\ntribes of Judah and Simeon (Judges i. 5-7). The prominence of Joshua as\r\nmilitary and religious leader, and especially his connexion with Shechem\r\nand Shiloh, have suggested that he was a hero of the Joseph tribes of\r\ncentral Palestine (viz. Ephraim and Manasseh). Moreover, the traditions\r\nin Joshua viii. 30-ix. 2, and Deut. xxvii. 1-8 seem to place the arrival\r\nat Mt Ebal immediately after the crossing of the Jordan. This implies\r\nthat Israel (like Jacob in Gen. xxxii.) crossed by the Jabbok, and in\r\nfact the Wadi Fari'a provides an easy road to Shechem, to the south-east\r\nof which lies Juleijil; and while this is the Gilgal of Deut. xi. 30,\r\nthe battles at Jericho and Ai (Joshua ii. seq.) occur naturally after\r\nthe encampment at the southern Gilgal (near Jericho). The alternative\r\nview (see especially Stade, _Gesch. Isr._ 1. 133 sqq.) connects itself\r\npartly with the ancestor of all the tribes (Jacob, i.e. Israel), and\r\npartly with the eponym of the Joseph tribes whose early days were spent\r\naround Shechem, the removal of whose bones from Egypt must have found a\r\nprominent place in the traditions of the tribes concerned (Gen. l. 25;\r\nExod. xiii. 19; Joshua xxiv. 32). According to one view (Stade,\r\nWellhausen, Guthe, &c.) only the Joseph tribes were in Egypt, and\r\nseparate tribal movements (see JUDAH) have been incorporated in the\r\ngrowth of the tradition; the probability that the specific traditions of\r\nthe Joseph tribes have been excised or subordinated finds support in the\r\nmanner in which the Judaean P has abridged and confused the tribal lists\r\nof Ephraim and Manasseh.\r\n\r\nThe serious character of the problems of early Israelite history can be\r\nperceived from the renewed endeavours to present an adequate outline of\r\nthe course of events; for a criticism of the most prominent hypotheses\r\nsee Cheyne, _Ency. Bib._ art. \"Tribes\" (col. 5209 seq.); a new theory\r\nhas been more recently advanced by E. Meyer (_Die Israeliten u. ihre\r\nNachbarstämme_, 1906). But Joshua as a tribal hero does not belong to\r\nthe earliest phase in the surviving traditions. He has no place in the\r\noldest surviving narratives of the exodus (Wellhausen, Steuernagel); and\r\nonly later sources add him to Caleb (Num. xiv. 30; the reference in\r\nDeut. i. 38 is part of an insertion), or regard him as the leader of all\r\nthe tribes (Deut. iii. 21, 28). As an attendant of Moses at the tent of\r\nmeeting he appears in quite secondary passages (Exod. xxxiii. 7-11; Num.\r\nxi. 28). His defeat of the Amalekites is in a narrative (Exod. xvii.\r\n8-16) which belongs more naturally to the wilderness of Shur, and it\r\nassociates him with traditions of a movement direct into south Palestine\r\nwhich finds its counterpart when the clan Caleb (q.v.) is artificially\r\ntreated as possessing its seats with Joshua's permission. But points of\r\nresemblance between Joshua the invader and Saul the founder of the\r\n(north) Israelite monarchy gain in weight when the traditions of both\r\nrecognize the inclusion or possession of Judah, and thus stand upon\r\nquite another plane as compared with those of David the founder of the\r\nJudaean dynasty. Instead of rejecting the older stories of Joshua's\r\nconquests it may be preferable to infer that there were radical\r\ndivergences in the historical views of the past. Consequently, the\r\nparallels between Joshua and Jacob (see Steuernagel's _Commentary_, p.\r\n150) are more significant when the occupation of central Palestine,\r\nalready implied in the book of Joshua, is viewed in the light of Gen.\r\nxlviii. 22, where Jacob as conqueror (cf. the very late form of the\r\ntradition in Jubilees xxxiv.) agrees with features in the patriarchal\r\nnarratives which, in implying a settlement in Palestine, are entirely\r\ndistinct from those which belong to the descent into Egypt (see\r\nespecially, Meyer, op. cit. pp. 227 seq., 414 seq., 433; Luther, ib. 108\r\nseq.). The elaborate account of the exodus gives the prevailing views\r\nwhich supersede other traditions of the origin both of the Israelites\r\nand of the worship of Yahweh (Gen. iv. 26). Several motives have\r\ninfluenced its growth,[6] and the kernel--the revelation of Yahweh to\r\nMoses--has been developed until all the tribes of Israel are included\r\nand their history as a people now begins. The old traditions of conquest\r\nin central Palestine have similarly been extended, and have been adapted\r\nto the now familiar view of Israelite origins. It is this subordination\r\nof earlier tradition to other and more predominating representations\r\nwhich probably explains the intricacy of a book whose present text may\r\nnot have been finally fixed until, as Dillmann held, as late as about\r\n200 B.C.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--See the commentaries of Dillmann, Steuernagel Holzinger\r\n  (German), or the concise edition by H.

F. Moore (_Ency. Bib._, col. 2608, note 2) draws attention to\r\n    the instructive parallel furnished by the Greek legends of the Dorian\r\n    invasion of the Peloponnesus (the \"return\" of the Heracleidae, the\r\n    partition of the land by lot, &c.).\r\n\r\n  [5] The historical problems are noticed in all biblical histories,\r\n    and in the commentaries on Joshua and Judges. Against the ordinary\r\n    critical view, see J. Orr, _Problem of the O.T._ (1905) pp. 240 seq.\r\n    This writer (on whom see A. S. Peake, _The Interpreter_, 1908, pp.\r\n    252 seq.) takes the book as a whole, allowance being made for \"the\r\n    generalizing tendency peculiar to all summaries.\" His argument that\r\n    \"the circumstantiality, local knowledge and evidently full\r\n    recollection of the narratives (in Joshua) give confidence in the\r\n    truth of their statements\" is one which historical criticism in no\r\n    field would regard as conclusive, and his contention that a redactor\r\n    would hardly incorporate conflicting traditions in his narrative \"if\r\n    he believed they contradicted it\" begs the question and ignores\r\n    Oriental literature.\r\n\r\n  [6] E.g. the vicissitudes of Levitical families, other migrations\r\n    into Palestine, &c. The story of Joseph has probably been used as a\r\n    link (see Luther, _op. cit._ pp. 142 seq.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOSHUA THE STYLITE, the reputed author of a chronicle which narrates the\r\nhistory of the war between the Greeks and Persians in 502-506, and which\r\nis one of the earliest and best historical documents preserved to us in\r\nSyriac. The work owes its preservation to having been incorporated in\r\nthe third part of the history of pseudo-Dionysius of Tell-Mahre, and may\r\nprobably have had a place in the second part of the _Ecclesiastical\r\nHistory_ of John of Asia, from whom (as Nau has shown) pseudo-Dionysius\r\ncopied all or most of the matter contained in his third part. The\r\nchronicle in question is anonymous, and Nau has shown that the note of a\r\ncopyist, which was thought to assign it to the monk Joshua of Zuknin\r\nnear Amid, more probably refers to the compiler of the whole work in\r\nwhich it was incorporated. Anyhow the author was an eye-witness of many\r\nof the events which he describes, and must have been living at Edessa\r\nduring the years when it suffered so severely from the Persian War. His\r\nview of events is everywhere characterized by his belief in overruling\r\nProvidence; and as he eulogizes Flavian II., the Chalcedonian patriarch\r\nof Antioch, in warmer terms than those in which he praises his great\r\nMonophysite contemporaries, Jacob of Serugh and Philoxenus of Mabbog, he\r\nwas probably an orthodox Catholic.\r\n\r\n  The chronicle was first made known by Assemani's abridged Latin\r\n  version (_B. O._ i. 260-283) and was edited in 1876 by the abbé Martin\r\n  and (with an English translation) by W. Wright in 1882. After an\r\n  elaborate dedication to a friend--the \"priest and abbot\" Sergius--a\r\n  brief recapitulation of events from the death of Julian in 363 and a\r\n  fuller account of the reigns of the Persian kings Peroz (457-484) and\r\n  Balash (484-488), the writer enters upon his main theme--the history\r\n  of the disturbed relations between the Persian and Greek Empires from\r\n  the beginning of the reign of Kawad I. (489-531), which culminated in\r\n  the great war of 502-506. From October 494 to the conclusion of peace\r\n  near the end of 506, the author gives an annalistic account, with\r\n  careful specification of dates, of the main events in Mesopotamia, the\r\n  theatre of conflict--such as the siege and capture of Amid by the\r\n  Persians (502-503), their unsuccessful siege of Edessa (503), and the\r\n  abortive attempt of the Greeks to recover Amid (504-505). The work was\r\n  probably written a few years after the conclusion of the war. The\r\n  style is graphic and straightforward, and the author was evidently a\r\n  man of good education and of a simple, honest mind.     (N. M.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOSIAH (Heb. _yo' shiyyahu_, perhaps \"Yah[weh] supports\"), in the Bible,\r\nthe grandson of Manasseh, and king of Judah. He came to the throne at\r\nthe age of eight, after the murder of his predecessor Amon. The\r\ncircumstances of his minority are not recorded, nor is anything related\r\nof the Scythian inroads which occurred in the latter half of the 7th\r\ncentury B.C., although some passages in the books of Jeremiah and\r\nZephaniah are supposed to refer to the events. The storm which shook the\r\nexternal states was favourable to the peace of Judah; the Assyrian power\r\nwas practically broken, and that of the Chaldeans had scarcely developed\r\ninto an aggressive form. Samaria thus lay within the grasp of Josiah,\r\nwho may have entertained hopes of forming an independent power of his\r\nown. Otherwise, it is not clear why we find him opposing himself to the\r\nEgyptian king Necho, since the assumption that he fought as an Assyrian\r\nvassal scarcely agrees with the profound reforming policy ascribed to\r\nhim. At all events, at the battle of Megiddo[1] he lost both his kingdom\r\nand his life (608 B.C.), and for a few years Judah was in the hands of\r\nEgypt (2 Kings xxiii. 29 seq.). The chronicler gives a rather different\r\naccount of the battle, and his allusion to the dirge uttered by Jeremiah\r\nover his death (2 Chron. xxxv. 20-25; 1 Esd. i. 32) represents the\r\ntradition which makes this prophet the author of the book of\r\nLamentations.\r\n\r\nThe reign of Josiah is important for the biblical account of the great\r\nreligious reforms which began in his eighteenth year, when he manifested\r\ninterest in the repair of the Temple at Jerusalem. In the course of this\r\nwork the high priest Hilkiah discovered a \"law-book\" which gave rise to\r\nthe liveliest concern. The reasons for believing that this roll was\r\nsubstantially identical with the book of Deuteronomy were already\r\nappreciated by Jerome, Chrysostom, Theodoret and others,[2] and a\r\ncareful examination shows that the character of the reformation which\r\nfollowed agrees in all its essential features with the prescriptions and\r\nexhortations of that book. (See DEUTERONOMY.) But the detailed records\r\nin 2 Kings xxii. seq. are evidently written under the influence of the\r\nreforms themselves, and are not contemporary (see KINGS, BOOK OF). They\r\nare further expanded, to agree with still later ideals, in 2 Chron.\r\nxxxiv. seq. The original roll was short enough to be read at least twice\r\nin a day (xxii. 8, 10), and hence only some portions of Deuteronomy (or\r\nof an allied production) may be intended. Although the character of the\r\nreforms throws remarkable light upon the condition of religion in Judah\r\nin the time of Josiah, it is to be observed that the writings of the\r\ncontemporary prophets (Jeremiah, Ezekiel) make it very questionable\r\nwhether the narratives are thoroughly trustworthy for the history of the\r\nking's measures.

He served in the campaign against\r\nNapoleon, and was present at the entry of the Allied Troops into Paris\r\n(March 31, 1814). In 1818 Jósika resigned his commission, returned to\r\nHungary, and married his first wife Elizabeth Kallai. The union proving\r\nan unhappy one, Jósika parted from his wife, settled on his estate at\r\nSzurdok in Transylvania, and devoted himself to agricultural and\r\nliterary pursuits. Drawn into the sphere of politics, he took part in\r\nthe memorable Transylvanian diet of 1834. About this time Jósika first\r\nbegan to attract attention as a writer of fiction. In 1836 his _Abafi_\r\nlaid the foundation of his literary reputation. This novel gives a vivid\r\npicture of Transylvania in the time of Sigismund Bátori. Jósika was soon\r\nafterwards elected member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and of\r\nthe Kisfaludy Society; of the latter he became, in 1841, director, and\r\nin 1842 vice-president. In 1847 he appeared at the Transylvanian diet as\r\nsecond deputy for the county of Szolnok, and zealously supported the\r\nmovement for the union of Transylvania with Hungary proper. In the same\r\nyear he was converted to Protestantism, was formally divorced from his\r\nwife, and married Baroness Julia Podmaniczky, herself a writer of\r\nconsiderable merit, with whom he lived happily until his death. So great\r\nwas Jósika's literary activity that by the time of the revolution (1848)\r\nhe had already produced about sixty volumes of romances and novels,\r\nbesides numerous contributions to periodicals. Both as magnate of the\r\nupper house of the Hungarian diet and by his writings Jósika aided the\r\nrevolutionary movement, with which he was soon personally identified,\r\nbeing chosen one of the members of the committee of national defence.\r\nConsequently, after the capitulation at Világos (Aug. 13, 1849) he found\r\nit necessary to flee the country, and settled first at Dresden and then,\r\nin 1850, at Brussels, where he resumed his literary pursuits\r\nanonymously. In 1864 he removed to Dresden, in which city he died on the\r\n27th of February 1865. The romances of Jósika, written somewhat after\r\nthe style of Sir Walter Scott, are chiefly of an historical and\r\nsocial-political character, his materials being drawn almost entirely\r\nfrom the annals of his own country. Among his more important works may\r\nbe specially mentioned, besides _Abafi_--_The Poet Zrinyi_ (1843); _The\r\nLast of the Bátoris_ (1837); _The Bohemians in Hungary_ (1839); _Esther_\r\n(1853); _Francis Rákóczy II._ (1861); and _A Végváriak_, a tale of the\r\ntime of the Transylvanian prince Bethlen Gábor, 1864. Many of Jósika's\r\nnovels have been translated into German.\r\n\r\n  See K. Moenich and S. Vutkovich, _Magyar Irók Névtára_ (1876); M.\r\n  Jókai, \"Jósika Miklós Emlékezete,\" _A Kisfaludy-Társaság Evlapjai, Új\r\n  folyam_, vol. iii. (1869); G. W. Steinacker, _Ungarische Lyriker_\r\n  (1874). Cf. also Jósika's autobiography--_Emlékirat_, vol. iv. (1865).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOSIPPON, the name usually given to a popular chronicle of Jewish\r\nhistory from Adam to the age of Titus, attributed to an author Josippon\r\nor Joseph ben Gorion.[1] The name, though at one time identified with\r\nthat of the historian Josephus, is perhaps a corruption of Hegesippus,\r\nfrom whom (according to Trieber) the author derived much of his\r\nmaterial. The chronicle was probably compiled in Hebrew early in the\r\n10th century, by a Jewish native of south Italy. The first edition was\r\nprinted in Mantua in 1476. _Josippon_ subsequently appeared in many\r\nforms, one of the most popular being in Yiddish (Judaeo-German), with\r\nquaint illustrations. Though the chronicle is more legendary than\r\nhistorical, it is not unlikely that some good and even ancient sources\r\nwere used by the first compiler, the _Josippon_ known to us having\r\npassed through the hands of many interpolators. The book enjoyed much\r\nvogue in England. Peter Morvyn in 1558 translated an abbreviated version\r\ninto English, and edition after edition was called for. Lucien Wolf has\r\nshown that the English translations of the Bible aroused so much\r\ninterest in the Jews that there was a widespread desire to know more\r\nabout them. This led to the circulation of many editions of _Josippon_,\r\nwhich thus formed a link in the chain of events which culminated in the\r\nreadmission of the Jews to England by Cromwell.     (I. A.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] A prefect of Jerusalem of this name is mentioned by Josephus,\r\n    _Bell. Jud._ ii. 20.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOSS, in the pidgin-English of the Chinese seaports, the name given to\r\nidols and deities. It is used adjectivally in regard to many things\r\nconnected with religious rites, such as \"joss-house,\" a temple;\r\n\"joss-stick,\" a stick which when burned gives forth a fragrant odour and\r\nis used as incense; \"joss-paper,\" paper cut to resemble money (and\r\nsometimes with prayers written upon it) burned in funeral and other\r\nceremonies. \"Joss\" is not a Chinese word, and is probably a corruption\r\nof Port. _deos_, god, applied by Portuguese navigators in the 16th\r\ncentury to the idols worshipped in the East Indies. The Dutch form is\r\n_joosge_ (diminutive of _joos_), whence the Javanese _dejos_, and the\r\nEnglish _yos_, later _joss_. The word seems to have been carried to\r\nChina by English seamen from Batavia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOST, ISAAK MARKUS (1793-1860), Jewish historical writer, was born on\r\nthe 22nd of February 1793 at Bernburg, and studied at the universities\r\nof Göttingen and Berlin. In Berlin he began to teach, and in 1835\r\nreceived the appointment of upper master in the Jewish commercial school\r\n(called the Philanthropin) at Frankfort-on-the-Main. Here he remained\r\nuntil his death, on the 22nd of November 1860. The work by which he is\r\nchiefly known is _Geschichte der Israeliten seit der Zeit der\r\nMaccabäer_, in 9 vols. (1820-1829), which was afterwards supplemented by\r\n_Neuere Geschichte der Israeliten von 1815-1845_ (1846-1847), and\r\n_Geschichte des Judenthums und seiner Sekten_ (1857-1859). He also\r\npublished an abridgment under the title _Allgemeine Geschichte des\r\nisraelitischen Volkes_ (1831-1832), and an edition of the Mishna with a\r\nGerman translation and notes (6 vols., 1832-1834). The _Israelitische\r\nAnnalen_ were edited by him from 1839 to 1841, and he contributed\r\nextensively to periodicals.\r\n\r\n  See Zirndorf, _Isaak Markus Jost und seine Freunde_ (Cincinnati,\r\n  1886).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOTUNHEIM, or JOTUN FJELDE, a mountainous region of southern Norway,\r\nlying between Gudbrandsdal on the east and Jostedalsbrae and the head of\r\nthe Sogne fjord on the west. Within an area of about 950 sq. m. it\r\ncontains the highest mountain in the Scandinavian Peninsula--Galdhöpiggen\r\n(8399 ft.)--and several others but little inferior. Such are Glittertind\r\nor Glitretind (8380), and Memurutind (7966), which face Galdhöpiggen\r\nacross the northward-sloping Visdal; Knutshulstind (7812) and several\r\nother peaks exceeding 7000 ft., to the south, between lakes Gjende and\r\nBygdin, and Skagastölstind (7723) in the west of the region, above the\r\nUtladal, the chief summit of the magnificent Horunger. The upper parts of\r\nthe main valleys are of characteristic form, not ending in lofty\r\nmountain-walls but comparatively low and level, and bearing lakes. The\r\nname Jotunheim (giants' home) is a modern memorial of the\r\nmountain-dwelling giants of Norse fable; the alternative name Jotun\r\nFjelde was the first bestowed on the region, when it was explored in 1820\r\nby the geologist Balthasar Matthias Keilhau (1797-1858). In modern times\r\nthe region has attracted mountaineers and many visitors accustomed to\r\nrough lodging and difficult travelling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOUBERT, BARTHÉLEMY CATHERINE (1769-1799), French general, the son of an\r\nadvocate, was born at Pont de Vaux (Ain) on the 14th of April 1769. In\r\n1784 he ran away from school to enlist in the artillery, but was brought\r\nback and sent to study law at Lyons and Dijon. In 1791 he joined the\r\nvolunteers of the Ain, and was elected by his comrades successively\r\ncorporal and sergeant. In January 1792 he became sub-lieutenant, and in\r\nNovember lieutenant, having in the meantime made his first campaign with\r\nthe army of Italy. In 1793 he distinguished himself by the brilliant\r\ndefence of a redoubt at the Col di Tenda, with only thirty men against a\r\nbattalion of the enemy. Wounded and made prisoner in this affair,\r\nJoubert was released on parole by the Austrian commander-in-chief,\r\nDevins, soon afterwards. In 1794 he was again actively engaged, and in\r\n1795 he rendered such conspicuous service as to be made general of\r\nbrigade. In the campaign of 1796 the young general commanded a brigade\r\nunder Augereau, and soon attracted the special attention of Bonaparte,\r\nwho caused him to be made a general of division in December, and\r\nrepeatedly selected him for the command of important detachments. Thus\r\nhe was in charge of the retaining force at the battle of Rivoli, and in\r\nthe campaign of 1799 (invasion of Austria) he commanded the detached\r\nleft wing of Bonaparte's army in Tirol, and fought his way through the\r\nmountains to rejoin his chief in Styria. He subsequently held various\r\ncommands in Holland, on the Rhine and in Italy, where up to January 1799\r\nhe commanded in chief. Resigning the post in consequence of a dispute\r\nwith the civil authorities, Joubert returned to France and married\r\n(June) Mlle de Montholon. But he was almost immediately summoned to the\r\nfield again. He took over the command in Italy from Moreau about the\r\nmiddle of July, but he persuaded his predecessor to remain at the front\r\nand was largely guided by his advice. The odds against the French troops\r\nin the disastrous campaign of 1799 (see FRENCH REVOLUTIONARY WARS) were\r\ntoo heavy. Joubert and Moreau were quickly compelled to give battle by\r\ntheir great antagonist Suvorov. The battle of Novi was disastrous to the\r\nFrench arms, not merely because it was a defeat, but above all because\r\nJoubert himself was amongst the first to fall (Aug. 15, 1799). Joubert\r\ndied before it could be shown whether his genius was of the first rank,\r\nbut he was at any rate marked out as a future great captain by the\r\ngreatest captain of all ages, and his countrymen intuitively associated\r\nhim with Hoche and Marceau as a great leader whose early death\r\ndisappointed their highest hopes. After the battle his remains were\r\nbrought to Toulon and buried in Fort La Malgue, and the revolutionary\r\ngovernment paid tribute to his memory by a ceremony of public mourning\r\n(Sept. 16). A monument to Joubert at Bourg was razed by order of Louis\r\nXVIII., but another memorial was afterwards erected at Pont de Vaux.\r\n\r\n  See Guilbert, _Notice sur la vie de B. C. Joubert_; Chevrier, _Le\r\n  Général Joubert d'après sa correspondance_ (2nd ed. 1884).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOUBERT, JOSEPH (1754-1824), French moralist, was born at Montignac\r\n(Corrèze) on the 6th of May 1754. After completing his studies at\r\nToulouse he spent some years there as a teacher. His delicate health\r\nproved unequal to the task, and after two years spent at home in study\r\nJoubert went to Paris at the beginning of 1778. He allied himself with\r\nthe chiefs of the philosophic party, especially with Diderot, of whom he\r\nwas in some sort a disciple, but his closest friendship was with the\r\nabbé de Fontanes. In 1790 he was recalled to his native place to act as\r\n_juge de paix_, and carried out the duties of his office with great\r\nfidelity. He had made the acquaintance of Mme de Beaumont in a\r\nBurgundian cottage where she had taken refuge from the Terror, and it\r\nwas under her inspiration that Joubert's genius was at its best. The\r\natmosphere of serenity and affection with which she surrounded him\r\nseemed necessary to the development of what Sainte-Beuve calls his\r\n\"esprit ailé, ami du ciel et des hauteurs.\" Her death in 1803 was a\r\ngreat blow to him, and his literary activity, never great, declined from\r\nthat time. In 1809, at the solicitation of Joseph de Bonald, he was made\r\nan inspector-general of education, and his professional duties\r\npractically absorbed his interests during the rest of his life. He died\r\non the 3rd of May 1824. His manuscripts were entrusted by his widow to\r\nChateaubriand, who published a selection of _Pensées_ from them in 1838\r\nfor private circulation. A more complete edition was published by\r\nJoubert's nephew, Paul de Raynal, under the title _Pensées, essais,\r\nmaximes et correspondance_ (2 vols. 1842). A selection of letters\r\naddressed to Joubert was published in 1883. Joubert constantly strove\r\nafter perfection, and the small quantity of his work was partly due to\r\nhis desire to find adequate and luminous expression for his\r\ndiscriminating criticism of literature and morals.\r\n\r\n  If Joubert's readers in England are not numerous, he is well known at\r\n  second hand through the sympathetic essay devoted to him in Matthew\r\n  Arnold's _Essays in Criticism_ (1st series). See Sainte-Beuve,\r\n  _Causeries du lundi_, vol. i.; _Portraits littéraires_, vol. ii.; and\r\n  a notice by Paul de Raynal, prefixed to the edition of 1842.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOUBERT, PETRUS JACOBUS (1834-1900), commandant-general of the South\r\nAfrican Republic from 1880 to 1900, was born at Cango, in the district\r\nof Oudtshoorn, Cape Colony, on the 20th of January 1834, a descendant of\r\na French Huguenot who fled to South Africa soon after the revocation of\r\nthe Edict of Nantes by Louis XIV. Left an orphan at an early age,\r\nJoubert migrated to the Transvaal, where he settled in the Wakkerstroom\r\ndistrict near Laing's Nek and the north-east angle of Natal. There he\r\nnot only farmed with great success, but turned his attention to the\r\nstudy of the law. The esteem in which his shrewdness in both farming and\r\nlegal affairs was held led to his election to the Volksraad as member\r\nfor Wakkerstroom early in the sixties, Marthinus Pretorius being then in\r\nhis second term of office as president. In 1870 Joubert was again\r\nelected, and the use to which he put his slender stock of legal\r\nknowledge secured him the appointment of attorney-general of the\r\nrepublic, while in 1875 he acted as president during the absence of T.\r\nF. Burgers in Europe. During the first British annexation of the\r\nTransvaal, Joubert earned for himself the reputation of a consistent\r\nirreconcilable by refusing to hold office under the government, as Paul\r\nKruger and other prominent Boers were doing. Instead of accepting the\r\nlucrative post offered him, he took a leading part in creating and\r\ndirecting the agitation which led to the war of 1880-1881, eventually\r\nbecoming, as commandant-general of the Boer forces, a member of the\r\ntriumvirate that administered the provisional Boer government set up in\r\nDecember 1880 at Heidelberg. He was in command of the Boer forces at\r\nLaing's Nek, Ingogo, and Majuba Hill, subsequently conducting the\r\nearlier peace negotiations that led to the conclusion of the Pretoria\r\nConvention. In 1883 he was a candidate for the presidency of the\r\nTransvaal, but received only 1171 votes as against 3431 cast for Kruger.\r\nIn 1893 he again opposed Kruger in the contest for the presidency,\r\nstanding as the representative of the comparatively progressive section\r\nof the Boers, who wished in some measure to redress the grievances of\r\nthe Uitlander population which had grown up on the Rand. The poll\r\n(though there is good reason for believing that the voting lists had\r\nbeen manipulated by Kruger's agents) was declared to have resulted in\r\n7911 votes being cast for Kruger and 7246 for Joubert. After a protest\r\nJoubert acquiesced in Kruger's continued presidency. He stood again in\r\n1898, but the Jameson raid had occurred meantime and the voting was\r\n12,858 for Kruger and 2001 for Joubert. Joubert's position had then\r\nbecome much weakened by accusations of treachery and of sympathy with\r\nthe Uitlander agitation. He took little part in the negotiations that\r\nculminated in the ultimatum sent to Great Britain by Kruger in 1899, and\r\nthough he immediately assumed nominal command of the operations on the\r\noutbreak of hostilities, he gave up to others the chief share in the\r\ndirection of the war, through his inability or neglect to impose upon\r\nthem his own will. His cautious nature, which had in early life gained\r\nhim the sobriquet of \"Slim Piet,\" joined to a lack of determination and\r\nassertiveness that characterized his whole career, led him to act mainly\r\non the defensive; and the strategically offensive movements of the Boer\r\nforces, such as Elandslaagte and Willow Grange, appear to have been\r\nneither planned nor executed by him. As the war went on, physical\r\nweakness led to Joubert's virtual retirement, and, though two days\r\nearlier he was still reported as being in supreme command, he died at\r\nPretoria from peritonitis on the 28th of March 1900. Sir George White,\r\nthe defender of Ladysmith, summed up Joubert's character when he called\r\nhim \"a soldier and a gentleman, and a brave and honourable opponent.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOUFFROY, JEAN (c. 1412-1473), French prelate and diplomatist, was born\r\nat Luxeuil (Haute-Saône). After entering the Benedictine order and\r\nteaching at the university of Paris from 1435 to 1438, he became almoner\r\nto Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy, who entrusted him with diplomatic\r\nmissions in France, Italy, Portugal and Castile. Jouffroy was appointed\r\nabbot of Luxeuil (1451?) bishop of Arras (1453), and papal legate\r\n(1459). At the French court his diplomatic duties brought him to the\r\nnotice of the dauphin (afterwards Louis XI.). Jouffroy entered Louis's\r\nservice, and obtained a cardinal's hat (1461), the bishopric of Albi\r\n(1462), and the abbacy of St Denis (1464). On several occasions he was\r\nsent to Rome to negotiate the abolition of the Pragmatic Sanction and to\r\ndefend the interests of the Angevins at Naples. Attached by King Louis\r\nto the sieur de Beaujeu in the expedition against John V., count of\r\nArmagnac, Jouffroy was accused of taking the town of Lectoure by\r\ntreachery, and of being a party to the murder of the count of Armagnac\r\n(1473). He died at Reuilly the same year.\r\n\r\n  See C. Fierrille, _Le Cardinal Jean Jouffroy et son temps_ (1412-1473)\r\n  (Coutances, Paris, 1874).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOUFFROY, THÉODORE SIMON (1706-1842), French philosopher, was born at\r\nPontets, near Mouthe, department of Doubs. In his tenth year, his\r\nfather, a tax-gatherer, sent him to an uncle at Pontarlier, under whom\r\nhe commenced his classical studies. At Dijon his compositions attracted\r\nthe attention of an inspector, who had him placed (1814) in the normal\r\nschool, Paris. He there came under the influence of Victor Cousin, and\r\nin 1817 he was appointed assistant professor of philosophy at the normal\r\nand Bourbon schools. Three years later, being thrown upon his own\r\nresources, he began a course of lectures in his own house, and formed\r\nliterary connexions with _Le Courrier français_, _Le Globe_,\r\n_L'Encyclopédie moderne_, and _La Revue européenne_. The variety of his\r\npursuits at this time carried him over the whole field of ancient and\r\nmodern literature. But he was chiefly attracted to the philosophical\r\nsystem represented by Reid and Stewart. The application of \"common\r\nsense\" to the problem of substance supplied a more satisfactory analytic\r\nfor him than the scepticism of Hume which reached him through a study of\r\nKant. He thus threw in his lot with the Scottish philosophy, and his\r\nfirst dissertations are, in their leading position, adaptations from\r\nReid's _Inquiry_. In 1826 he wrote a preface to a translation of the\r\n_Moral Philosophy_ of Stewart, demonstrating the possibility of a\r\nscientific statement of the laws of consciousness; in 1828 he began a\r\ntranslation of the works of Reid, and in his preface estimated the\r\ninfluence of Scottish criticism upon philosophy, giving a biographical\r\naccount of the movement from Hutcheson onwards. Next year he was\r\nreturned to parlement by the _arrondissement_ of Pontarlier; but the\r\nwork of legislation was ill-suited to him. Yet he attended to his duties\r\nconscientiously, and ultimately broke his health in their discharge. In\r\n1833 he was appointed professor of Greek and Roman philosophy at the\r\ncollege of France and a member of the Academy of Sciences; he then\r\npublished the _Mélanges philosophiques_ (4th ed. 1866; Eng. trans. G.\r\nRipley, Boston, 1835 and 1838), a collection of fugitive papers in\r\ncriticism and philosophy and history. In them is foreshadowed all that\r\nhe afterwards worked out in metaphysics, psychology, ethics and\r\naesthetics. He had already demonstrated in his prefaces the possibility\r\nof a psychology apart from physiology, of the science of the phenomena\r\nof consciousness distinct from the perceptions of sense. He now\r\nclassified the mental faculties, premising that they must not be\r\nconfounded with capacities or properties of mind. They were, according\r\nto his analysis, personal will, primitive instincts, voluntary movement,\r\nnatural and artificial signs, sensibility and the faculties of\r\nintellect; on this analytic he founded his scheme of the universe. In\r\n1835 he published a _Cours de droit naturel_ (4th ed. 1866), which, for\r\nprecision of statement and logical coherence, is the most important of\r\nhis works. From the conception of a universal order in the universe he\r\nreasons to a Supreme Being, who has created it and who has conferred\r\nupon every man in harmony with it the aim of his existence, leading to\r\nhis highest good. Good, he says, is the fulfilment of man's destiny,\r\nevil the thwarting of it. Every man being organized in a particular way\r\nhas, of necessity, an aim, the fulfilment of which is good; and he has\r\nfaculties for accomplishing it, directed by reason. The aim is good,\r\nhowever, only when reason guides it for the benefit of the majority, but\r\nthat is not absolute good. When reason rises to the conception of\r\nuniversal order, when actions are submitted, by the exercise of a\r\nsympathy working necessarily and intuitively to the idea of the\r\nuniversal order, the good has been reached, the true good, good in\r\nitself, absolute good. But he does not follow his idea into the details\r\nof human duty, though he passes in review fatalism, mysticism,\r\npantheism, scepticism, egotism, sentimentalism and rationalism. In 1835\r\nJouffroy's health failed and he went to Italy, where he continued to\r\ntranslate the Scottish philosophers. On his return he became librarian\r\nto the university, and took the chair of recent philosophy at the\r\nfaculty of letters. He died in Paris on the 4th of February 1842. After\r\nhis death were published _Nouveaux mélanges philosophiques_ (3rd ed.\r\n1872) and _Cours d'esthétique_ (3rd ed. 1875). The former contributed\r\nnothing new to the system except a more emphatic statement of the\r\ndistinction between psychology and physiology. The latter formulated his\r\ntheory of beauty.\r\n\r\nJouffroy's claim to distinction rests upon his ability as an expositor\r\nof other men's ideas. He founded no system; he contributed nothing of\r\nimportance to philosophical science; he initiated nothing which has\r\nsurvived him. But his enthusiasm for mental science, and his command\r\nover the language of popular exposition, made him a great international\r\nmedium for the transfusion of ideas. He stood between Scotland and\r\nFrance and Germany and France; and, though his expositions are vitiated\r\nby loose reading of the philosophers he interpreted, he did serviceable,\r\neven memorable work.\r\n\r\n  See L. Lévy Bruhl, _History of Modern Philos. in France_ (1899), pp.\r\n  349-357; C. J. Tissot, _Th. Jouffroy: sa vie et ses écrits_ (1876); J.\r\n  P.

Fr. _joug_, from Lat. _jugum_, a yoke), an\r\ninstrument of punishment formerly in use in Scotland, Holland and\r\npossibly other countries. It was an iron collar fastened by a short\r\nchain to a wall, often of the parish church, or to a tree. The collar\r\nwas placed round the offender's neck and fastened by a padlock. The\r\njougs was practically a pillory. It was used for ecclesiastical as well\r\nas civil offences. Examples may still be seen in Scotland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOULE, JAMES PRESCOTT (1818-1889), English physicist, was born on the\r\n24th of December 1818, at Salford, near Manchester. Although he received\r\nsome instruction from John Dalton in chemistry, most of his scientific\r\nknowledge was self-taught, and this was especially the case with regard\r\nto electricity and electro-magnetism, the subjects in which his earliest\r\nresearches were carried out. From the first he appreciated the\r\nimportance of accurate measurement, and all through his life the\r\nattainment of exact quantitative data was one of his chief\r\nconsiderations. At the age of nineteen he invented an electro-magnetic\r\nengine, and in the course of examining its performance dissatisfaction\r\nwith vague and arbitrary methods of specifying electrical quantities\r\ncaused him to adopt a convenient and scientific unit, which he took to\r\nbe the amount of electricity required to decompose nine grains of water\r\nin one hour. In 1840 he was thus enabled to give a quantitative\r\nstatement of the law according to which heat is produced in a conductor\r\nby the passage of an electric current, and in succeeding years he\r\npublished a series of valuable researches on the agency of electricity\r\nin transformations of energy. One of these contained the first\r\nintimation of the achievement with which his name is most widely\r\nassociated, for it was in a paper read before the British Association at\r\nCork in 1843, and entitled \"The Calorific Effects of Magneto-electricity\r\nand the Mechanical Value of Heat,\" that he expressed the conviction that\r\nwhenever mechanical force is expended an exact equivalent of heat is\r\nalways obtained. By rotating a small electro-magnet in water, between\r\nthe poles of another magnet, and then measuring the heat developed in\r\nthe water and other parts of the machine, the current induced in the\r\ncoils, and the energy required to maintain rotation, he calculated that\r\nthe quantity of heat capable of warming one pound of water one degree F.\r\nwas equivalent to the mechanical force which could raise 838 lb. through\r\nthe distance of one foot. At the same time he brought forward another\r\ndetermination based on the heating effects observable when water is\r\nforced through capillary tubes; the number obtained in this way was 770.\r\nA third method, depending on the observation of the heat evolved by the\r\nmechanical compression of air, was employed a year or two later, and\r\nyielded the number 798; and a fourth--the well-known frictional one of\r\nstirring water with a sort of paddle-wheel--yielded the result 890 (see\r\n_Brit. Assoc. Report_, 1845), though 781.5 was obtained by subsequent\r\nrepetitions of the experiment. In 1849 he presented to the Royal\r\nSociety a memoir which, together with a history of the subject,\r\ncontained details of a long series of determinations, the result of\r\nwhich was 772. A good many years later he was entrusted by the committee\r\nof the British Association on standards of electric resistance with the\r\ntask of deducing the mechanical equivalent of heat from the thermal\r\neffects of electric currents. This inquiry yielded (in 1867) the result\r\n783, and this Joule himself was inclined to regard as more accurate than\r\nhis old determination by the frictional method; the latter, however, was\r\nrepeated with every precaution, and again indicated 772.55 foot-pounds\r\nas the quantity of work that must be expended at sea-level in the\r\nlatitude of Greenwich in order to raise the temperature of one pound of\r\nwater, weighed _in vacuo_, from 60° to 61° F. Ultimately the discrepancy\r\nwas traced to an error which, not by Joule's fault, vitiated the\r\ndetermination by the electrical method, for it was found that the\r\nstandard ohm, as actually defined by the British Association committee\r\nand as used by him, was slightly smaller than was intended; when the\r\nnecessary corrections were made the results of the two methods were\r\nalmost precisely congruent, and thus the figure 772.55 was vindicated.\r\nIn addition, numerous other researches stand to Joule's credit--the work\r\ndone in compressing gases and the thermal changes they undergo when\r\nforced under pressure through small apertures (with Lord Kelvin), the\r\nchange of volume on solution, the change of temperature produced by the\r\nlongitudinal extension and compression of solids, &c. It was during the\r\nexperiments involved by the first of these inquiries that Joule was\r\nincidentally led to appreciate the value of surface condensation in\r\nincreasing the efficiency of the steam engine. A new form of condenser\r\nwas tested on the small engine employed, and the results it yielded\r\nformed the starting-point of a series of investigations which were aided\r\nby a special grant from the Royal Society, and were described in an\r\nelaborate memoir presented to it on the 13th of December 1860. His\r\nresults, according to Kelvin, led directly and speedily to the present\r\npractical method of surface-condensation, one of the most important\r\nimprovements of the steam engine, especially for marine use, since the\r\ndays of James Watt. Joule died at Sale on the 11th of October 1889.\r\n\r\n  His scientific papers were collected and published by the Physical\r\n  Society of London: the first volume, which appeared in 1884, contained\r\n  the researches for which he was alone responsible, and the second,\r\n  dated 1887, those which he carried out in association with other\r\n  workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOURDAN, JEAN BAPTISTE, COUNT (1762-1833), marshal of France, was born\r\nat Limoges on the 29th of April 1762, and in his boyhood was apprenticed\r\nto a silk merchant of Lyons. In 1776 he enlisted in a French regiment to\r\nserve in the American War of Independence, and after being invalided in\r\n1784 he married and set up in business at Limoges. At the outbreak of\r\nthe revolutionary wars he volunteered, and as a subaltern took part in\r\nthe first campaigns in the north of France. His rise was even more rapid\r\nthan that of Hoche and Marceau. By 1793 he had become a general of\r\ndivision, and was selected by Carnot to succeed Houchard as\r\ncommander-in-chief of the Army of the North; and on the 15th-16th of\r\nOctober 1793 he won the brilliant and important victory of Wattignies\r\n(see FRENCH REVOLUTIONARY WARS). Soon afterwards he became a \"suspect,\"\r\nthe moderation of his political opinions and his misgivings as to the\r\nfuture conduct of the war being equally distasteful to the truculent and\r\nenthusiastic Committee of Public Safety. Warned in time by his friend\r\nCarnot and by Barère, he avoided arrest and resumed his business as a\r\nsilk-mercer in Limoges. He was soon reinstated, and early in 1794 was\r\nappointed commander-in-chief of the Army of Sambre-et-Meuse. After\r\nrepeated attempts to force the passage of the Sambre had failed and\r\nseveral severe general actions had been fought without result, Jourdan\r\nand his army were discouraged, but Carnot and the civil commissioners\r\nurged the general, even with threats, to a last effort, and this time he\r\nwas successful not only in crossing the Sambre but in winning a\r\nbrilliant victory at Fleurus (June 26, 1794), the consequence of which\r\nwas the extension of the French sphere of influence to the Rhine, on\r\nwhich river he waged an indecisive campaign in 1795.\r\n\r\nIn 1796 his army formed the left wing of the advance into Bavaria. The\r\nwhole of the French forces were ordered to advance on Vienna, Jourdan on\r\nthe extreme left and Moreau in the centre by the Danube valley,\r\nBonaparte on the right by Italy and Styria. The campaign began\r\nbrilliantly, the Austrians under the Archduke Charles being driven back\r\nby Moreau and Jourdan almost to the Austrian frontier. But the archduke,\r\nslipping away from Moreau, threw his whole weight on Jourdan, who was\r\ndefeated at Amberg and Würzburg, and forced over the Rhine after a\r\nsevere rearguard action, which cost the life of Marceau. Moreau had to\r\nfall back in turn, and, apart from Bonaparte's marvellous campaign in\r\nItaly, the operations of the year were disastrous. The chief cause of\r\nfailure was the vicious plan of campaign imposed upon the generals by\r\ntheir government. Jourdan was nevertheless made the scapegoat of the\r\ngovernment's mistakes and was not employed for two years. In those years\r\nhe became prominent as a politician and above all as the framer of the\r\nfamous conscription law of 1798. When the war was renewed in 1799\r\nJourdan was placed at the head of the army on the Rhine, but again\r\nunderwent defeat at the hands of the archduke Charles at Stockach (March\r\n25), and, disappointed and broken in health, handed over the command to\r\nMasséna. He at once resumed his political duties, and was a prominent\r\nopponent of the _coup d'état_ of 18 Brumaire, after which he was\r\nexpelled from the Council of the Five Hundred. Soon, however, he became\r\nformally reconciled to the new régime, and accepted from Napoleon fresh\r\nmilitary and civil employment. In 1800 he became inspector-general of\r\ncavalry and infantry and representative of French interests in the\r\nCisalpine Republic, and in 1804 he was made a marshal of France. He\r\nremained in the new kingdom of Italy until 1806, when Joseph Bonaparte,\r\nwhom his brother made king of Naples in that year, selected Jourdan as\r\nhis military adviser. He followed Joseph into Spain in the same capacity\r\nin 1808. But Joseph's throne had to be maintained by the French army,\r\nand throughout the Peninsular War the other marshals, who depended\r\ndirectly upon Napoleon, paid little heed either to Joseph or to Jourdan.\r\nAfter the battle of Vitoria he held no important command up to the fall\r\nof the Empire. Jourdan gave in his adhesion to the restoration\r\ngovernment of 1814, and though he rejoined Napoleon in the Hundred Days\r\nand commanded a minor army, he submitted to the Bourbons again after\r\nWaterloo. He refused, however, to be a member of the court which tried\r\nMarshal Ney. He was made a count, a peer of France (1819), and governor\r\nof Grenoble (1816). In politics he was a prominent opponent of the\r\nroyalist reactionaries and supported the revolution of 1830. After this\r\nevent he held the portfolio of foreign affairs for a few days, and then\r\nbecame governor of the Invalides, where his last years were spent.\r\nMarshal Jourdan died on the 23rd of November 1833, and was buried in the\r\nInvalides.\r\n\r\n  He wrote _Opérations de l'armée du Danube_ (1799); _Mémoires pour\r\n  servir à l'histoire sur la campagne de 1796_ (1819); and unpublished\r\n  personal memoirs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOURNAL (through Fr. from late Lat. _diurnalis_, daily), a daily record\r\nof events or business. A private journal is usually an elaborated diary.\r\nWhen applied to a newspaper or other periodical the word is strictly\r\nused of one published each day; but any publication issued at stated\r\nintervals, such as a magazine or the record of the transactions of a\r\nlearned society, is commonly called a journal. The word \"journalist\" for\r\none whose business is writing for the public press (see NEWSPAPERS)\r\nseems to be as old as the end of the 17th century.\r\n\r\n\"Journal\" is particularly applied to the record, day by day, of the\r\nbusiness and proceedings of a public body. The journals of the British\r\nhouses of parliament contain an official record of the business\r\ntransacted day by day in either house. The record does not take note of\r\nspeeches, though some of the earlier volumes contain references to them.\r\nThe journals are a lengthened account written from the \"votes and\r\nproceedings\" (in the House of Lords called \"minutes of the\r\nproceedings\"), made day by day by the assistant clerks, and printed on\r\nthe responsibility of the clerk to the house, after submission to the\r\n\"subcommittee on the journals.\" In the Commons the journal is passed by\r\nthe Speaker before publication. The journals of the House of Commons\r\nbegin in the first year of the reign of Edward VI. (1547), and are\r\ncomplete, except for a short interval under Elizabeth. Those of the\r\nHouse of Lords date from the first year of Henry VIII. (1509). Before\r\nthat date the proceedings in parliament were entered in the rolls of\r\nparliament, which extend from 1278 to 1503. The journals of the Lords\r\nare \"records\" in the judicial sense, those of the Commons are not (see\r\nErskine May, _Parliamentary Practice_, 1906, pp. 201-202).\r\n\r\nThe term \"journal\" is used, in business, for a book in which an account\r\nof transactions is kept previous to a transfer to the ledger (see\r\nBOOK-KEEPING), and also as an equivalent to a ship's log, as a record of\r\nthe daily run, observations, weather changes, &c. In mining, a journal\r\nis a record describing the various strata passed through in sinking a\r\nshaft. A particular use of the word is that, in machinery, for the parts\r\nof a shaft which are in contact with the bearings; the origin of this\r\nmeaning, which is firmly established, has not been explained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOURNEY (through O. Fr. _jornee_ or _journee_, mod. Fr. _journée_, from\r\nmed. Lat. _diurnata_, Lat. _diurnus_, of or belonging to _dies_, day),\r\nproperly that which occupies a day in its performance, and so a day's\r\nwork, particularly a day's travel, and the distance covered by such,\r\nusually reckoned in the middle ages as twenty miles. The word is now\r\nused of travel covering a certain amount of distance or lasting a\r\ncertain amount of time, frequently defined by qualifying words.\r\n\"Journey\" is usually applied to travel by land, as opposed to \"voyage,\"\r\ntravel by sea. The early use of \"journey\" for a day's work, or the\r\namount produced by a day's work, is still found in glassmaking, and also\r\nat the British Mint, where a \"journey\" is taken as equivalent to the\r\ncoinage of 15 lb. of standard gold, 701 sovereigns, and of 60 lb. of\r\nsilver. The term \"journeyman\" also preserves the original significance\r\nof the word. It distinguishes a qualified workman or mechanic from an\r\n\"apprentice\" on the one hand and a \"master\" on the other, and is applied\r\nto one who is employed by another person to work at his trade or\r\noccupation at a day's wage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOUVENET, JEAN (1647-1717), French painter, born at Rouen, came of a\r\nfamily of artists, one of whom had taught Poussin. He early showed\r\nremarkable aptitude for his profession, and, on arriving in Paris,\r\nattracted the attention of Le Brun, by whom he was employed at\r\nVersailles, and under whose auspices, in 1675, he became a member of the\r\nAcadémie Royale, of which he was elected professor in 1681, and one of\r\nthe four perpetual rectors in 1707. The great mass of works that he\r\nexecuted, chiefly in Paris, many of which, including his celebrated\r\nMiraculous Draught of Fishes (engraved by Audran; also Landon,\r\n_Annales_, i. 42), are now in the Louvre, show his fertility in\r\ninvention and execution, and also that he possessed in a high degree\r\nthat general dignity of arrangement and style which distinguished the\r\nschool of Le Brun. Jouvenet died on the 5th of April 1717, having been\r\nforced by paralysis during the last four years of his life to work with\r\nhis left hand.\r\n\r\n  See _Mém. inéd. acad. roy. de p. et de sc._, 1854, and D'Argenville,\r\n  _Vies des peintres_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOUY, VICTOR JOSEPH ÉTIENNE DE (1764-1846), French dramatist, was born\r\nat Jouy, near Versailles, on the 12th of September 1764. At the age of\r\neighteen he received a commission in the army, and sailed for South\r\nAmerica in the company of the governor of Guiana. He returned almost\r\nimmediately to France to complete his studies, and re-entered the\r\nservice two years later. He was sent to India, where he met with many\r\nromantic adventures which were afterwards turned to literary account. On\r\nthe outbreak of the Revolution he returned to France and served with\r\ndistinction in the early campaigns, attaining the rank of\r\nadjutant-general. He drew suspicion on himself, however, by refusing to\r\nhonour the toast of Marat, and had to fly for his life. At the fall of\r\nthe Terror he resumed his commission but again fell under suspicion,\r\nbeing accused of treasonable correspondence with the English envoy,\r\nJames Harris, 1st earl of Malmesbury who had been sent to France to\r\nnegotiate terms of peace. He was acquitted of this charge, but, weary of\r\nrepeated attacks, resigned his position on the pretext of his numerous\r\nwounds. Jouy now turned his attention to literature, and produced in\r\n1807 with immense success his opera _La vestale_ (music by Spontini).\r\nThe piece ran for a hundred nights, and was characterized by the\r\nInstitute of France as the best lyric drama of the day. Other operas\r\nfollowed, but none obtained so great a success. He published in the\r\n_Gazette de France_ a series of satirical sketches of Parisian life,\r\ncollected under the title of _L'Ermite de la Chaussée d'Antin, ou\r\nobservations sur les moeurs et les usages français au commencement du\r\nxix^e siècle_ (1812-1814, 5 vols.), which was warmly received. In 1821\r\nhis tragedy of _Sylla_ gained a triumph due in part to the genius of\r\nTalma, who had studied the title-rôle from Napoleon. Under the\r\nRestoration Jouy consistently fought for the cause of freedom, and if\r\nhis work was overrated by his contemporaries, they were probably\r\ninfluenced by their respect for the author himself. He died in rooms set\r\napart for his use in the palace of St Germain-en-Laye on the 4th of\r\nSeptember 1846.\r\n\r\n  Out of the long list of his operas, tragedies and miscellaneous\r\n  writings may be mentioned, _Fernand Cortez_ (1809), opera, in\r\n  collaboration with J. E. Esménard, music by Spontini; _Tippo Saïb_,\r\n  tragedy (1813); _Bélisaire_, tragedy (1818); _Les Hermites en prison_\r\n  (1823), written in collaboration with Antoine Jay, like himself a\r\n  political prisoner; _Guillaume Tell_ (1829), with Hippolyte Bis, for\r\n  the music of Rossini. Jouy was also one of the founders of the\r\n  _Biographie nouvelle des contemporains_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOVELLANOS (or JOVE LLANOS), GASPAR MELCHOR DE (1744-1811), Spanish\r\nstatesman and author, was born at Gijon in Asturias, Spain, on the 5th\r\nof January 1744. Selecting law as his profession, he studied at Oviedo,\r\nAvila, and Alcalá, and in 1767 became criminal judge at Seville. His\r\nintegrity and ability were rewarded in 1778 by a judgeship in Madrid,\r\nand in 1780 by appointment to the council of military orders. In the\r\ncapital Jovellanos took a good place in the literary and scientific\r\nsocieties; for the society of friends of the country he wrote in 1787\r\nhis most valuable work, _Informe sobre un proyecto de ley agraria_.\r\nInvolved in the disgrace of his friend, François Cabarrus, Jovellanos\r\nspent the years 1790 to 1797 in a sort of banishment at Gijon, engaged\r\nin literary work and in founding the Asturian institution for\r\nagricultural, industrial, social and educational reform throughout his\r\nnative province. This institution continued his darling project up to\r\nthe latest hours of his life. Summoned again to public life in 1797,\r\nJovellanos refused the post of ambassador to Russia, but accepted that\r\nof minister of grace and justice, under \"the prince of the peace,\" whose\r\nattention had been directed to him by Cabarrus, then a favourite of\r\nGodoy. Displeased with Godoy's policy and conduct Jovellanos combined\r\nwith his colleague Saavedra to procure his dismissal. Godoy returned to\r\npower in 1798; Jovellanos was again sent to Gijon, but in 1801 was\r\nthrown into prison in Majorca. The revolution of 1808, and the advance\r\nof the French into Spain, set him once more at liberty. Joseph\r\nBonaparte, on mounting the Spanish throne, made Jovellanos the most\r\nbrilliant offers; but the latter, sternly refusing them all, joined the\r\npatriotic party, became a member of the central junta, and contributed\r\nto reorganize the cortes. This accomplished, the junta at once fell\r\nunder suspicion, and Jovellanos was involved in its fall. To expose the\r\nconduct of the cortes, and to defend the junta and himself were the last\r\nlabours of his pen. In 1811 he was enthusiastically welcomed to Gijon;\r\nbut the approach of the French drove him forth again. The vessel in\r\nwhich he sailed was compelled by stress of weather to put in at Vega in\r\nAsturias, and there he died on the 27th of November 1811.\r\n\r\n  The poetical works of Jovellanos comprise a tragedy _El pelayo_, the\r\n  comedy _El delincuente honrado_, satires, and miscellaneous pieces,\r\n  including a translation of the first book of _Paradise Lost_. His\r\n  prose works, especially those on political and legislative economy,\r\n  constitute his real title to literary fame. In them depth of thought\r\n  and clear-sighted sagacity are couched in a certain Ciceronian\r\n  elegance and classical purity of style. Besides the _Ley agraria_ he\r\n  wrote _Elogios_; various political and other essays; and _Memorias\r\n  politicas_ (1801), suppressed in Spain, and translated into French,\r\n  1825. An edition of his complete works was published at Madrid\r\n  (1831-1832) in 7 vols., and another at Barcelona (1839).\r\n\r\n  See _Noticias historicas de Don G. M. de Jovellanos_ (1812), and\r\n  _Memorias para la vida del Señor ... Jovellanos_, by J. A. C. Bermudez\r\n  (1814).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOVELLAR Y SOLER, JOAQUIN (1819-1892), captain-general of Spain, was\r\nborn at Palma de Mallorca, on the 28th of December 1819. At the close of\r\nhis studies at the military academy he was appointed sub-lieutenant,\r\nwent to Cuba as captain in 1842, returned to the War Office in 1851, was\r\npromoted major in 1853, and went to Morocco as private secretary to\r\nMarshal O'Donnell, who made him colonel in 1860 after Jovellar had been\r\nwounded at the battle of Wad el Ras. In 1863 Jovellar became a\r\nbrigadier-general, in 1864 under-secretary for war; he was severely\r\nwounded in fighting the insurgents in the streets of Madrid, and rose to\r\nthe rank of general of division in 1866. Jovellar adhered to the\r\nrevolution, and King Amadeus made him a lieutenant-general in 1872. He\r\nabsented himself from Spain when the federal republic was proclaimed,\r\nand returned in the autumn of 1873, when Castelár sent him to Cuba as\r\ngovernor-general. In 1874 Jovellar came back to the Peninsula, and was\r\nin command of the Army of the Centre against the Carlists when Marshal\r\nCampos went to Sagunto to proclaim Alfonso XII. General Jovellar became\r\nwar minister in the first cabinet of the restoration under Canovas, who\r\nsent him to Cuba again as governor-general, where he remained until the\r\n18th of June 1878, when the ten years' insurrection closed with the\r\npeace of Zaujon. Alfonso XII. made him a captain-general, president of\r\nthe council, life-senator, and governor-general of the Philippines.\r\nJovellar died in Madrid on the 17th of April 1892.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOVIAN (FLAVIUS JOVIANUS) (c. 332-364), Roman emperor from June 363 to\r\nFebruary 364, was born at Singidunum in Moesia about 332. As captain of\r\nthe imperial bodyguard he accompanied Julian in his Persian expedition;\r\nand on the day after that emperor's death, when the aged Sallust,\r\nprefect of the East, declined the purple, the choice of the army fell\r\nupon Jovian. His election caused considerable surprise, and it is\r\nsuggested by Ammianus Marcellinus that he was wrongly identified with\r\nanother Jovian, chief notary, whose name also had been put forward, or\r\nthat, during the acclamations, the soldiers mistook the name Jovianus\r\nfor Julianus, and imagined that the latter had recovered from his\r\nillness. Jovian at once continued the retreat begun by Julian, and,\r\ncontinually harassed by the Persians, succeeded in reaching the banks of\r\nthe Tigris, where a humiliating treaty was concluded with the Persian\r\nking, Shapur II. (q.v.). Five provinces which had been conquered by\r\nGalerius in 298 were surrendered, together with Nisibis and other\r\ncities. The Romans also gave up all their interests in the kingdom of\r\nArmenia, and abandoned its Christian prince Arsaces to the Persians.\r\nDuring his return to Constantinople Jovian was found dead in his bed at\r\nDadastana, halfway between Ancyra and Nicaea. A surfeit of mushrooms or\r\nthe fumes of a charcoal fire have been assigned as the cause of death.\r\nUnder Jovian, Christianity was established as the state religion, and\r\nthe Labarum of Constantine again became the standard of the army. The\r\nstatement that he issued an edict of toleration, to the effect that,\r\nwhile the exercise of magical rites would be severely punished, his\r\nsubjects should enjoy full liberty of conscience, rests on insufficient\r\nevidence. Jovian entertained a great regard for Athanasius, whom he\r\nreinstated on the archiepiscopal throne, desiring him to draw up a\r\nstatement of the Catholic faith. In Syriac literature Jovian became the\r\nhero of a Christian romance (G. Hoffmann, _Julianus der Abtrünnige_,\r\n1880).\r\n\r\n  See Ammianus Marcellinus, xxv. 5-10; J. P. de la Bléterie, _Histoire\r\n  de Jovien_ (1740); Gibbon, _Decline and Fall_, chs. xxiv., xxv.; J.\r\n  Wordsworth in Smith and Wace's _Dictionary of Christian Biography_; H.\r\n  Schiller, _Geschichte der römischen Kaiserzeit_, vol. ii. (1887); A.\r\n  de Broglie, _L'Église et l'empire romain au iv^e siècle_ (4th ed.\r\n  1882). For the relations of Rome and Persia see PERSIA: _Ancient\r\n  History_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOVINIANUS, or JOVIANUS, a Roman monk of heterodox views, who flourished\r\nduring the latter half of the 4th century. All our knowledge of him is\r\nderived from a passionately hostile polemic of Jerome (_Adv. Jovinianum,\r\nLibri II._), written at Bethlehem in 393, and without any personal\r\nacquaintance with the man assailed. According to this authority Jovinian\r\nin 388 was living at Rome the celibate life of an ascetic monk,\r\npossessed a good acquaintance with the Bible, and was the author of\r\nseveral minor works, but, undergoing an heretical change of view,\r\nafterwards became a self-indulgent Epicurean and unrefined sensualist.\r\nThe views which excited this denunciation were mainly these: (1)\r\nJovinian held that in point of merit, so far as their domestic state was\r\nconcerned, virgins, widows and married persons who had been baptized\r\ninto Christ were on a precisely equal footing; (2) those who with full\r\nfaith have been regenerated in baptism cannot be overthrown (or,\r\naccording to another reading, tempted) of the devil; (3) to abstain from\r\nmeats is not more praiseworthy than thankfully to enjoy them; (4) all\r\nwho have preserved their baptismal grace shall receive the same reward\r\nin the kingdom of heaven.[1] Jovinian thus indicates a natural and\r\nvigorous reaction against the exaggerated asceticism of the 4th century,\r\na protest shared by Helvidius and Vigilantius. He was condemned by a\r\nRoman synod under Bishop Siricius in 390, and afterwards excommunicated\r\nby another at Milan under the presidency of Ambrose. The year of his\r\ndeath is unknown, but he is referred to as no longer alive in Jerome's\r\n_Contra Vigilantium_ (406).\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] See, more fully, Harnack, _Hist. of Dogma_, v. 57.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOVIUS, PAULUS, or PAOLO GIOVIO (1483-1552), Italian historian and\r\nbiographer, was born of an ancient and noble family at Como on the 19th\r\nof April 1483. His father died when he was a child, and Giovio owed his\r\neducation to his brother Benedetto. After studying the humanities, he\r\napplied himself to medicine and philosophy at his brother's request. He\r\nwas Pomponazzi's pupil at Padua; and afterwards he took a medical degree\r\nin the university of Pavia. He exercised the medical profession in Rome,\r\nbut the attraction of literature proved irresistible for Giovio, and he\r\nwas bent upon becoming the historian of his age. He presented a portion\r\nof his history to Leo X., who read the MS., and pronounced it superior\r\nin elegance to anything since Livy. Thus encouraged, Giovio took up his\r\nresidence in Rome, and attached himself to Cardinal Giulio de' Medici,\r\nthe pope's nephew. The next pope, Adrian VI., gave him a canonry in\r\nComo, on the condition, it is said, that Giovio should mention him with\r\nhonour in his history. This patronage from a pontiff who was averse from\r\nthe current tone of Italian humanism proves that Giovio at this period\r\npassed for a man of sound learning and sober manners. After Adrian's\r\ndeath, Giulio de' Medici became pope as Clement VII. and assigned him\r\nchambers in the Vatican, with maintenance for servants befitting a\r\ncourtier of rank. In addition to other benefices, he finally, in 1528,\r\nbestowed on him the bishopric of Nocera. Giovio had now become in a\r\nspecial sense dependent on the Medici. He was employed by that family on\r\nseveral missions--as when he accompanied Ippolito to Bologna on the\r\noccasion of Charles V.'s coronation, and Caterina to Marseilles before\r\nher marriage to the duke of Orleans. During the siege of Rome in 1527 he\r\nattended Clement in his flight from the Vatican. While crossing the\r\nbridge which connected the palace with the castle of S. Angelo, Giovio\r\nthrew his mantle over the pope's shoulders in order to disguise his\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\n  In the sack he suffered a serious pecuniary and literary loss, if we\r\n  may credit his own statement. The story runs that he deposited the MS.\r\n  of his history, together with some silver, in a box at S. Maria Sopra\r\n  Minerva for safety. This box was discovered by two Spaniards, one of\r\n  whom secured the silver, while the other, named Herrera, knowing who\r\n  Giovio was, preferred to hold the MSS. for ransom. Herrera was so\r\n  careless, however, as to throw away the sheets he found in paper,\r\n  reserving only that portion of the work which was transcribed on\r\n  parchment. This he subsequently sold to Giovo in exchange for a\r\n  benifice at Cordova, which Clement VII. conceded to the Spaniard. Six\r\n  books of the history were lost in this transaction. Giovo contented\r\n  himself with indicating their substance in a summary. Perhaps he was\r\n  not unwilling that his work should resemble that of Livy, even in its\r\n  imperfection. But doubt rests upon the whole of this story. Apostolo\r\n  Zeno affirms that in the middle of the last century three of the\r\n  missing books turned up among family papers in the possession of Count\r\n  Giov. Batt. Giovio, who wrote a panegyric on his ancestor. It is\r\n  therefore not improbable that Giovio possessed his history intact, but\r\n  preferred to withhold from publication those portions which might have\r\n  involved him in difficulties with living persons of importance. The\r\n  omissions were afterwards made good by Curtio Marinello in the Italian\r\n  edition, published at Venice in 1581. But whether Marinello was the\r\n  author of these additions is not known.\r\n\r\nAfter Clement's death Giovio found himself out of favour with the next\r\npope, Paul III. The failure of his career is usually ascribed to the\r\nirregularity of the life he led in the literary society of Rome. We may\r\nalso remember that Paul had special causes for animosity against the\r\nMedici, whose servant Giovio had been. Despairing of a cardinal's hat,\r\nGiovio retired to his villa on the lake of Como, where he spent the\r\nwealth he had acquired from donations and benefices in adorning his\r\nvilla with curiosities, antiquities and pictures, including a very\r\nimportant collection of portraits of famous soldiers and men of letters,\r\nnow almost entirely dispersed. He died upon a visit to Florence in 1552.\r\n\r\n  Giovio's principal work was the _History of His Own Times_, from the\r\n  invasion of Charles VIII. to the year 1547. It was divided into two\r\n  parts, containing altogether forty-five books. Of these, books v.-xi.\r\n  of part i. were said by him to have been lost in the sack of Rome,\r\n  while books xix.-xxiv. of part ii., which should have embraced the\r\n  period from the death of Leo to the sack, were never written. Giovio\r\n  supplied the want of the latter six books by his lives of Leo, Adrian,\r\n  Alphonso I. of Ferrara, and several other personages of importance.\r\n  But he alleged that the history of that period was too painful to be\r\n  written in full. His first published work, printed in 1524 at Rome,\r\n  was a treatise _De piscibus romanis_. After his retirement to Como he\r\n  produced a valuable series of biographies, entitled _Elogia virorum\r\n  illustrium_. They commemorate men distinguished for letters and arms,\r\n  selected from all periods, and are said to have been written in\r\n  illustration of portraits collected by him for the museum of his villa\r\n  at Como. Besides these books, we may mention a biographical history of\r\n  the Visconti, lords of Milan; an essay on mottoes and badges; a\r\n  dissertation on the state of Turkey; a large collection of familiar\r\n  epistles; together with descriptions of Britain, Muscovy, the Lake of\r\n  Como and Giovio's own villa. The titles of these miscellanies will be\r\n  found in the bibliographical note appended to this article.\r\n\r\nGiovio preferred Latin in the composition of his more important works.\r\nThough contemporary with Machiavelli, Guicciardini and Varchi, he\r\nadhered to humanistic usages, and cared more for the Latinity than for\r\nthe matter of his histories. His style is fluent and sonorous rather\r\nthan pointed or grave. Partly owing to the rhetorical defects inherent\r\nin this choice of Latin, when Italian had gained the day, but more to\r\nhis own untrustworthy and shallow character, Giovio takes a lower rank\r\nas historian than the bulk and prestige of his writings would seem to\r\nwarrant. He professed himself a flatterer and a lampooner, writing\r\nfulsome eulogies on the princes who paid him well, while he ignored or\r\ncriticized those who proved less generous. The old story that he said he\r\nkept a golden and an iron pen, to use according as people paid him,\r\ncondenses the truth in epigram. His private morals were of a dubious\r\ncharacter, and as a writer he had the faults of the elder humanists, in\r\ncombination with that literary cynicism which reached its height in\r\nAretino; and therefore his histories and biographical essays are not to\r\nbe used as authorities, without corroboration. Yet Giovio's works, taken\r\nin their entirety and with proper reservation, have real value. To the\r\nstudent of Italy they yield a lively picture of the manners and the\r\nfeeling of the times in which he lived, and in which he played no\r\nobscure part. They abound in vivid sketches, telling anecdotes, fugitive\r\ncomments, which unite a certain charm of autobiographical romance with\r\nthe worldly wisdom of an experienced courtier. A flavour of personality\r\nmakes them not unpleasant reading. While we learn to despise and\r\nmistrust the man in Giovio, we appreciate the author. It would not be\r\ntoo far-fetched to describe him as a sort of 16th-century Horace\r\nWalpole.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--The sources of Giovio's biography are: his own works;\r\n  Tiraboschi's _History of Italian Literature_; Litta's _Genealogy of\r\n  Illustrious Italian Families_; and Giov.

A. S.)\r\n\r\n  The best and most complete edition of Giovio's works is that of Basel\r\n  (1678). For his life see Giuseppe Sanesi, \"Alcuni osservazioni e\r\n  notizie intorno a tre storici minori del cinquecento--Giovio; Nerli,\r\n  Segni\" (in _Archivio Storico Italiano_, 5th series, vol. xxiii.); Eug.\r\n  Müntz, _Sul museo di ritratti composto da Paolo Giovio_ (ibid., vol.\r\n  xix.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOWETT, BENJAMIN (1817-1893), English scholar and theologian, master of\r\nBalliol College, Oxford, was born in Camberwell on the 15th of April\r\n1817. His father was one of a Yorkshire family who, for three\r\ngenerations, had been supporters of the Evangelical movement in the\r\nChurch of England. His mother was a Langhorne, in some way related to\r\nthe poet and translator of Plutarch. At twelve the boy was placed on the\r\nfoundation of St Paul's School (then in St Paul's Churchyard), and in\r\nhis nineteenth year he obtained an open scholarship at Balliol. In 1838\r\nhe gained a fellowship, and graduated with first-class honours in 1839.\r\nBrought up amongst pious Evangelicals, he came to Oxford at the height\r\nof the Tractarian movement, and through the friendship of W. G. Ward was\r\ndrawn for a time in the direction of High Anglicanism; but a stronger\r\nand more lasting influence was that of the Arnold school, represented by\r\nA. P. Stanley. Jowett was thus led to concentrate his attention on\r\ntheology, and in the summers of 1845 and 1846, spent in Germany with\r\nStanley, he became an eager student of German criticism and speculation.\r\nAmongst the writings of that period he was most impressed by those of F.\r\nC. Baur. But he never ceased to exercise an independent judgment, and\r\nhis work on St Paul, which appeared in 1855, was the result of much\r\noriginal reflection and inquiry. He was appointed to the Greek\r\nprofessorship in the autumn of that year. He had been a tutor of Balliol\r\nand a clergyman since 1842, and had devoted himself to the work of\r\ntuition with unexampled zeal. His pupils became his friends for life. He\r\ndiscerned their capabilities, studied their characters, and sought to\r\nremedy their defects by frank and searching criticism. Like another\r\nSocrates, he taught them to know themselves, repressing vanity,\r\nencouraging the despondent, and attaching all alike by his unobtrusive\r\nsympathy. This work gradually made a strong impression, and those who\r\ncared for Oxford began to speak of him as \"the great tutor.\" As early as\r\n1839 Stanley had joined with Tait, the future archbishop, in advocating\r\ncertain university reforms. From 1846 onwards Jowett threw himself into\r\nthis movement, which in 1848 became general amongst the younger and more\r\nthoughtful fellows, until it took effect in the commission of 1850 and\r\nthe act of 1854. Another educational reform, the opening of the Indian\r\ncivil service to competition, took place at the same time, and Jowett\r\nwas one of the commission. He had two brothers who served and died in\r\nIndia, and he never ceased to take a deep and practical interest in\r\nIndian affairs. A great disappointment, his repulse for the mastership\r\nof Balliol, also in 1854, appears to have roused him into the completion\r\nof his book on _The Epistles of St Paul_. This work, described by one of\r\nhis friends as \"a miracle of boldness,\" is full of originality and\r\nsuggestiveness, but its publication awakened against him a storm of\r\ntheological prejudice, which followed him more or less through life.\r\nInstead of yielding to this, he joined with Henry Bristowe Wilson and\r\nRowland Williams, who had been similarly attacked, in the production of\r\nthe volume known as _Essays and Reviews_. This appeared in 1860 and gave\r\nrise to a strange outbreak of fanaticism. Jowett's loyalty to those who\r\nwere prosecuted on this account was no less characteristic than his\r\npersistent silence while the augmentation of his salary as Greek\r\nprofessor was withheld. This petty persecution was continued until 1865,\r\nwhen E. A. Freeman and Charles Elton discovered by historical research\r\nthat a breach of the conditions of the professorship had occurred, and\r\nChrist Church raised the endowment from £40 a year to £500. Meanwhile\r\nJowett's influence at Oxford had steadily increased. It culminated in\r\n1864, when the country clergy, provoked by the final acquittal of the\r\nessayists, had voted in convocation against the endowment of the Greek\r\nchair. Jowett's pupils, who were now drawn from the university at large,\r\nsupported him with the enthusiasm which young men feel for the victim of\r\ninjustice. In the midst of other labours Jowett had been quietly\r\nexerting his influence so as to conciliate all shades of liberal\r\nopinion, and bring them to bear upon the abolition of the theological\r\ntest, which was still required for the M.A. and other degrees, and for\r\nuniversity and college offices. He spoke at an important meeting upon\r\nthis question in London on the 10th of June 1864, which laid the ground\r\nfor the University Tests Act of 1871. In connexion with the Greek\r\nprofessorship Jowett had undertaken a work on Plato which grew into a\r\ncomplete translation of the _Dialogues_, with introductory essays. At\r\nthis he laboured in vacation time for at least ten years. But his\r\ninterest in theology had not abated, and his thoughts found an outlet in\r\noccasional preaching. The university pulpit, indeed, was closed to him,\r\nbut several congregations in London delighted in his sermons, and from\r\n1866 until the year of his death he preached annually in Westminster\r\nAbbey, where Stanley had become dean in 1863. Three volumes of selected\r\nsermons have been published since his death. The years 1865-1870 were\r\noccupied with assiduous labour. Amongst his pupils at Balliol were men\r\ndestined to high positions in the state, whose parents had thus shown\r\ntheir confidence in the supposed heretic, and gratitude on this account\r\nwas added to other motives for his unsparing efforts in tuition. In\r\n1870, by an arrangement which he attributed to his friend Robert Lowe,\r\nafterwards Lord Sherbrooke (at that time a member of Gladstone's\r\nministry), Scott was promoted to the deanery of Rochester and Jowett was\r\nelected to the vacant mastership by the fellows of Balliol. From the\r\nvantage-ground of this long-coveted position the _Plato_ was published\r\nin 1871. It had a great and well-deserved success. While scholars\r\ncriticized particular renderings (and there were many small errors to be\r\nremoved in subsequent editions), it was generally agreed that he had\r\nsucceeded in making Plato an English classic.\r\n\r\nIf ever there was a beneficent despotism, it was Jowett's rule as\r\nmaster. Since 1866 his authority in Balliol had been really paramount,\r\nand various reforms in college had been due to his initiative. The\r\nopposing minority were now powerless, and the younger fellows who had\r\nbeen his pupils were more inclined to follow him than others would have\r\nbeen. There was no obstacle to the continued exercise of his firm and\r\nreasonable will. He still knew the undergraduates individually, and\r\nwatched their progress with a vigilant eye. His influence in the\r\nuniversity was less assured. The pulpit of St Mary's was no longer\r\nclosed to him, but the success of Balliol in the schools gave rise to\r\njealousy in other colleges, and old prejudices did not suddenly give\r\nway; while a new movement in favour of \"the endowment of research\" ran\r\ncounter to his immediate purposes. Meanwhile, the tutorships in other\r\ncolleges, and some of the headships also, were being filled with Balliol\r\nmen, and Jowett's former pupils were prominent in both houses of\r\nparliament and at the bar. He continued the practice, which he had\r\ncommenced in 1848, of taking with him a small party of undergraduates in\r\nvacation time, and working with them in one of his favourite haunts, at\r\nAskrigg in Wensleydale, or Tummel Bridge, or later at West Malvern. The\r\nnew hall (1876), the organ there, entirely his gift (1885), and the\r\ncricket ground (1889), remain as external monuments of the master's\r\nactivity. Neither business nor the many claims of friendship interrupted\r\nliterary work. The six or seven weeks of the long vacation, during which\r\nhe had pupils with him, were mainly employed in writing. The translation\r\nof Aristotle's _Politics_, the revision of Plato, and, above all, the\r\ntranslation of Thucydides many times revised, occupied several years.\r\nThe edition of the _Republic_, undertaken in 1856, remained unfinished,\r\nbut was continued with the help of Professor Lewis Campbell. Other\r\nliterary schemes of larger scope and deeper interest were long in\r\ncontemplation, but were not destined to take effect--an _Essay on the\r\nReligions of the World, a Commentary on the Gospels_, a _Life of\r\nChrist_, a volume on _Moral Ideas_. Such plans were frustrated, not only\r\nby his practical avocations, but by his determination to finish what he\r\nhad begun, and the fastidious self-criticism which it took so long to\r\nsatisfy. The book on Morals might, however, have been written but for\r\nthe heavy burden of the vice-chancellorship, which he was induced to\r\naccept in 1882, by the hope, only partially fulfilled, of securing many\r\nimprovements for the university. The vice-chancellor was _ex officio_ a\r\ndelegate of the press, where he hoped to effect much; and a plan for\r\ndraining the Thames Valley, which he had now the power of initiating,\r\nwas one on which his mind had dwelt for many years. The exhausting\r\nlabours of the vice-chancellorship were followed by an illness (1887);\r\nand after this he relinquished the hope of producing any great original\r\nwriting. His literary industry was thenceforth confined to his\r\ncommentary on the _Republic_ of Plato, and some essays on Aristotle\r\nwhich were to have formed a companion volume to the translation of the\r\n_Politics_. The essays which should have accompanied the translation of\r\nThucydides were never written. Jowett, who never married, died on the\r\n1st of October 1893. The funeral was one of the most impressive ever\r\nseen in Oxford. The pall-bearers were seven heads of colleges and the\r\nprovost of Eton, all old pupils.\r\n\r\nTheologian, tutor, university reformer, a great master of a college,\r\nJowett's best claim to the remembrance of succeeding generations was his\r\ngreatness as a moral teacher. Many of the most prominent Englishmen of\r\nthe day were his pupils and owed much of what they were to his precept\r\nand example, his penetrative sympathy, his insistent criticism, and his\r\nunwearying friendship. Seldom have ideal aims been so steadily pursued\r\nwith so clear a recognition of practical limitations. Jowett's\r\ntheological work was transitional, and yet has an element of permanence.\r\nAs has been said of another thinker, he was \"one of those deeply\r\nreligious men who, when crude theological notions are being revised and\r\ncalled in question seek to put new life into theology by wider and more\r\nhumane ideas.\" In earlier life he had been a zealous student of Kant and\r\nHegel, and to the end he never ceased to cultivate the philosophic\r\nspirit; but he had little confidence in metaphysical systems, and sought\r\nrather to translate philosophy into the wisdom of life. As a classical\r\nscholar, his scorn of littlenesses sometimes led him into the neglect of\r\n_minutiae_, but he had the higher merit of interpreting ideas. His place\r\nin literature rests really on the essays in his Plato. When their merits\r\nare fully recognized, it will be found that his worth, as a teacher of\r\nhis countrymen, extends far beyond his own generation.\r\n\r\n  See _The Life and Letters of Benjamin Jowett_, by E. A. Abbott and\r\n  Lewis Campbell (1897); _Benjamin Jowett_, by Lionel Tollemache (1895).\r\n       (L. C.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOYEUSE, a small town in the department of Ardèche, France, situated on\r\nthe Baume, a tributary of the Ardèche, is historically important as\r\nhaving been the seat of a noble French family which derived its name\r\nfrom it. The lordship of Joyeuse came, in the 13th century, into the\r\npossession of the house of Châteauneuf-Randon, and was made into a\r\nviscountship in 1432. Guillaume, viscount of Joyeuse, was bishop of\r\nAlet, but afterwards left the church, and became a marshal of France; he\r\ndied in 1592. His eldest son Anne de Joyeuse (1561-1587), was one of the\r\nfavourites of Henry III. of France, who created him duke and peer\r\n(1581), admiral of France (1582), and governor of Normandy (1586), and\r\nmarried him to Marguerite de Lorraine-Vaudémont, younger sister of the\r\nqueen. He gained several successes against the Huguenots, but was\r\nrecalled by court intrigues at an inopportune moment, and when he\r\nmarched a second time against Henry of Navarre he was defeated and\r\nkilled at Coutras. Guillaume had three other sons: François de Joyeuse\r\n(d. 1615), cardinal and archbishop of Narbonne, Toulouse and Rouen, who\r\nbrought about the reconciliation of Henry IV. with the pope; Henri,\r\ncount of Bouchage, and later duke of Joyeuse, who first entered the\r\narmy, then became a Capuchin under the name of Père Ange, left the\r\nchurch and became a marshal of France, and finally re-entered the\r\nchurch, dying in 1608; Antoine Scipion, grand prior of Toulouse in the\r\norder of the knights of Malta, who was one of the leaders in the League,\r\nand died in the retreat of Villemur (1592). Henriette Catherine de\r\nJoyeuse, daughter of Henri, married in 1611 Charles of Lorraine, duke of\r\nGuise, to whom she brought the duchy of Joyeuse. On the death of her\r\ngreat-grandson, François Joseph de Lorraine, duke of Guise, in 1675,\r\nwithout issue, the duchy of Joyeuse was declared extinct, but it was\r\nrevived in 1714, in favour of Louis de Melun, prince of Épinoy.\r\n     (M. P.*)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOYEUSE ENTRÉE, a famous charter of liberty granted to Brabant by Duke\r\nJohn III. in 1354. John summoned the representatives of the cities of\r\nthe duchy to Louvain to announce to them the marriage of his daughter\r\nand heiress Jeanne of Brabant to Wenceslaus duke of Luxemburg, and he\r\noffered them liberal concessions in order to secure their assent to the\r\nchange of dynasty. John III. died in 1355, and Wenceslaus and Jeanne on\r\nthe occasion of their state entry into Brussels solemnly swore to\r\nobserve all the provisions of the charter, which had been drawn up. From\r\nthe occasion on which it was first proclaimed this charter has since\r\nbeen known in history as _La Joyeuse Entrée_. By this document the dukes\r\nof Brabant undertook to maintain the integrity of the duchy, and not to\r\nwage war, make treaties, or impose taxes without the consent of their\r\nsubjects, as represented by the municipalities. All members of the\r\nduke's council were to be native-born Brabanters. This charter became\r\nthe model for other provinces and the bulwark of the liberties of the\r\nNetherlands. Its provisions were modified from time to time, but\r\nremained practically unchanged from the reign of Charles V. onwards. The\r\nill-advised attempt of the emperor Joseph II. in his reforming zeal to\r\nabrogate the _Joyeuse Entrée_ caused a revolt in Brabant, before which\r\nhe had to yield.\r\n\r\n  See E. Poullet, _La Joyeuse entrée, ou constitution Brabançonne_\r\n  (1862).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUAN FERNANDEZ ISLANDS, a small group in the South Pacific Ocean,\r\nbetween 33° and 34° S., 80° W., belonging to Chile and included in the\r\nprovince of Valparaiso. The main island is called _Mas-a-Tierra_ (Span.\r\n\"more to land\") to distinguish it from a smaller island, _Mas-a-Fuera_\r\n(\"more to sea\"), 100 m. farther west. Off the S.W. of Mas-a-Tierra lies\r\nthe islet of Santa Clara. The aspect of Mas-a-Tierra is beautiful; only\r\n13 m. in length by 4 in width, it consists of a series of precipitous\r\nrocks rudely piled into irregular blocks and pinnacles, and strongly\r\ncontrasting with a rich vegetation. The highest of these, 3225 ft., is\r\ncalled, from its massive form, El Yunque (the anvil). The rocks are\r\nvolcanic. Cumberland Bay on the north side is the only fair anchorage,\r\nand even there, from the great depth of water, there is some risk. A\r\nwide valley collecting streams from several of the ravines on the north\r\nside of the island opens into Cumberland Bay, and is partially enclosed\r\nand cultivated. The inhabitants number only some twenty.\r\n\r\n  The flora and fauna of Juan Fernandez are in most respects Chilean.\r\n  There are few trees on the island, for most of the valuable indigenous\r\n  trees have been practically exterminated, such as the sandalwood,\r\n  which the earlier navigators found one of the most valuable products\r\n  of the island. Ferns are prominent among the flora, about one-third of\r\n  which consists of endemic species. There are no indigenous land\r\n  mammals. Pigs and goats, however, with cattle, horses, asses and dogs,\r\n  have been introduced, have multiplied, and in considerable numbers run\r\n  wild. Sea-elephants and fur-seals were formerly plentiful. Of birds,\r\n  a tyrant and a humming-bird (_Eustephanus fernandensis_) are peculiar\r\n  to the group, while another humming bird (_E. galerites_), a thrush,\r\n  and some birds of prey also occur in Chile. _E. fernandensis_ has the\r\n  peculiarity that the male is of a bright cinnamon colour, while the\r\n  female is green. Both sexes are green in _E. galerites_.\r\n\r\nJuan Fernandez was discovered by a Spanish pilot of that name in 1563.\r\nFernandez obtained from the Spanish government a grant of the islands,\r\nwhere he resided for some time, stocking them with goats and pigs. He\r\nsoon, however, appears to have abandoned his possessions, which were\r\nafterwards for many years only visited occasionally by fishermen from\r\nthe coasts of Chile and Peru. In 1616 Jacob le Maire and Willem Cornelis\r\nSchouten called at Juan Fernandez for water and fresh provisions. Pigs\r\nand goats were then abundant on the islands. In February 1700 Dampier\r\ncalled at Juan Fernandez and while there Captain Straddling of the\r\n\"Cinque Porte\" galley quarrelled with his men, forty-two of whom\r\ndeserted but were afterwards taken on board by Dampier; five seamen,\r\nhowever, remained on shore. Other parties had previously colonized the\r\nislands but none had remained permanently. In October 1704 the \"Cinque\r\nPorte\" returned and found two of these men, the others having been\r\napparently captured by the French. On this occasion Straddling\r\nquarrelled with Alexander Selkirk (q.v.), who, at his own request,\r\nbecame the island's most famous colonist, for his adventures are\r\ncommonly believed to have inspired Daniel Defoe's _Robinson Crusoe_.\r\nAmong later visits, that of Commodore Anson, in the \"Centurion\" (June\r\n1741) led, on his return home, to a proposal to form an English\r\nsettlement on Juan Fernandez; but the Spaniards, hearing that the matter\r\nhad been mooted in England, gave orders to occupy the island, and it was\r\ngarrisoned accordingly in 1750. Philip Carteret first observed this\r\nsettlement in May 1767, and on account of the hostility of the Spaniards\r\npreferred to put in at Masa-Fuera. After the establishment of the\r\nindependence of Chile at the beginning of the 19th century, Juan\r\nFernandez passed into the possession of that country. On more than one\r\noccasion before 1840 Mas-a-Tierra was used as a state prison by the\r\nChilean government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUANGS (Patuas, literally \"leaf-wearers\"), a jungle tribe of Orissa,\r\nIndia. They are found in only two of the tributary states, Dhenkanal and\r\nKeonjhar, most of them in the latter. They are estimated to amount in\r\nall to about 10,000. Their language belongs to the Munda family. They\r\nhave no traditions which connect them with any other race, and they\r\nrepudiate all connexion with the Hos or the Santals, declaring\r\nthemselves the aborigines. They say the headquarters of the tribe is the\r\nGonasika. In manners they are among the most primitive people of the\r\nworld, representing the Stone age in our own day. They do not till the\r\nland, but live on the game they kill or on snakes and vermin. Their huts\r\nmeasure about 6 ft. by 8 ft., with very low doorways. The interior is\r\ndivided into two compartments. In the first of these the father and all\r\nthe females of a family huddle together; the second is used as a\r\nstore-room. The boys have a separate hut at the entrance to the village,\r\nwhich serves as a guest-house and general assembly place where the\r\nmusical instruments of the village are kept. Physically they are small\r\nand weak-looking, of a reddish-brown colour, with flat faces, broad\r\nnoses with wide nostrils, large mouths and thick lips, the hair coarse\r\nand frizzly. The women until recently wore nothing but girdles of\r\nleaves, the men, a diminutive bandage of cloth. The Juangs declare that\r\nthe river goddess, emerging for the first time from the Gonasika rock,\r\nsurprised a party of naked Juangs dancing, and ordered them to wear\r\nleaves, with the threat that they should die if they ever gave up the\r\ncustom. The Juangs' weapons are the bow and arrow and a primitive sling\r\nmade entirely of cord. Their religion is a vague belief in forest\r\nspirits. They offer fowls to the sun when in trouble and to the earth\r\nfor a bountiful harvest. Polygamy is rare. They burn their dead and\r\nthrow the ashes into any running stream. The most sacred oaths a Juang\r\ncan take are those on an ant-hill or a tiger-skin.\r\n\r\n  See E. W. Dalton, _Descriptive Ethnology of Bengal_ (1872).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUAN MANUEL, DON (1282-1349), infante of Castile, son of the infante Don\r\nManuel and Beatrix of Savoy, and grandson of St Ferdinand, was born at\r\nEscalona on the 5th of May 1282. His father died in 1284, and the young\r\nprince was educated at the court of his cousin, Sancho IV., with whom\r\nhis precocious ability made him a favourite. In 1294 he was appointed\r\n_adelantado_ of Murcia and in his fourteenth year served against the\r\nMoors at Granada. In 1304 he was entrusted by the queen-mother, Doña\r\nMaria de Molina, to conduct political negotiations with James II. of\r\nAragon on behalf of her son, Ferdinand IV., then under age. His\r\ndiplomacy was successful and his marriage to James II.'s daughter,\r\nConstantina, added to his prestige. On the death of Ferdinand IV. and of\r\nthe regents who governed in the name of Alphonso XI., Don Juan Manuel\r\nacted as guardian of the king who was proclaimed of age in 1325. His\r\nambitious design of continuing to exercise the royal power was defeated\r\nby Alphonso XI., who married the ex-regent's daughter Constanza, and\r\nremoved his father-in-law from the scene by nominating him _adelantado\r\nmayor de la frontera_. Alphonso XI.'s repudiation of Constanza, whom he\r\nimprisoned at Toro, drove Don Juan Manuel into opposition, and a long\r\nperiod of civil war followed. On the death of his wife Constantina in\r\n1327, Don Juan Manuel strengthened his position by marrying Doña Blanca\r\nde la Cerda; he secured the support of Juan Nuñez, _alférez_ of Castile,\r\nby arranging a marriage between him and Maria, daughter of Don Juan el\r\nTuerto; he won over Portugal by promising the hand of his daughter, the\r\nex-queen Constanza, to the infante of that kingdom, and he entered into\r\nalliance with Mahomet III. of Granada. This formidable coalition\r\ncompelled Alphonso XI. to sue for terms, which he accepted in 1328\r\nwithout any serious intention of complying with them; but he was\r\ncompelled to release Doña Constanza. War speedily broke out anew, and\r\nlasted till 1331 when Alphonso XI. invited Juan Manuel and Juan Nuñez to\r\na banquet at Villahumbrales with the intention, it was believed, of\r\nassassinating them; the plot failed, and Don Juan Manuel joined forces\r\nwith Peter IV. of Aragon. He was besieged by Alphonso XI. at\r\nGarci-Nuñez, whence he escaped on the 30th of July 1336, fled into\r\nexile, and kept the rebellion alive till 1338, when he made his peace\r\nwith the king. He proved his loyalty by serving in further expeditions\r\nagainst the Moors of Granada and Africa, and died a tranquil death in\r\nthe first half of 1349.\r\n\r\nDistinguished as an astute politician, Don Juan Manuel is an author of\r\nthe highest eminence, and, considering the circumstances of his stormy\r\nlife, his voluminousness is remarkable. The _Libro de los sabios_, a\r\ntreatise called _Engeños de Guerra_ and the _Libro de cantares_, a\r\ncollection of verses, were composed between 1320 and 1327; but they have\r\ndisappeared together with the _Libro de la caballería_ (written during\r\nthe winter of 1326), and the _Reglas como se debe trovar_, a metrical\r\ntreatise assigned to 1328-1334. Of his surviving writings, Juan Manuel's\r\n_Crónica abreviada_ was compiled between 1319 and 1325, while the _Libro\r\nde la caza_ must have been written between 1320 and 1329; and during\r\nthis period of nine years the _Crónica de España_, the _Crónica\r\ncomplida_, and the _Tratado sobre las armas_ were produced. The _Libro\r\ndel caballero et del escudero_ was finished before the end of 1326; the\r\nfirst book of the _Libro de los estados_ was finished on the 22nd of May\r\n1330, while the second was begun five days later; the first book of _El\r\nConde Lucanor_ was written in 1328, the second in 1330, and the fourth\r\nis dated 12th of June 1335. We are unable to assign to any precise date\r\nthe devout _Tractado_ on the Virgin, dedicated to the prior of the\r\nmonastery at Peñafiel, to which Don Juan Manuel bequeathed his\r\nmanuscripts; but it seems probable that the _Libro de los frailes\r\npredicadores_ is slightly later than the _Libro de los estados_; that\r\nthe _Libro de los castigos_ (left unfinished, and therefore known by the\r\nalternative title of _Libro infinido_) was written not later than 1333,\r\nand that the treatise _De las maneras de amor_ was composed between 1334\r\nand 1337.\r\n\r\nThe historical summaries, pious dissertations and miscellaneous writings\r\nare of secondary interest. The _Libro del caballero et del escudero_ is\r\non another plane; it is no doubt suggested by Lull's _Libre del orde de\r\ncavalleria_, but the points of resemblance have been exaggerated; the\r\nmorbid mysticism of Lull is rejected, and the carefully finished style\r\njustifies the special pride which the author took in this performance.\r\nThe influence of Lull's Blanquerna is likewise visible in the _Libro de\r\nlos estados_; but there are marked divergences of substance which go to\r\nprove Don Juan Manuel's acquaintance with some version (not yet\r\nidentified) of the Barlaam and Josaphat legend. Nothing is more striking\r\nthan the curious and varied erudition of the turbulent prince who weaves\r\nhis personal experiences with historical or legendary incidents, with\r\nreminiscences of Aesop and Phaedrus, with the _Disciplina clericalis_,\r\nwith _Kalilah and Dimnah_, with countless Oriental traditions, and with\r\nall the material of anecdotic literature which he embodies in the _Libro\r\nde patronio_, best known by the title of _El Conde Lucanor_ (the name\r\nLucanor being taken from the prose _Tristan_). This work (also entitled\r\nthe _Libro de enxemplos_) was first printed by Gonzalo Argote de Molina\r\nat Seville in 1575, and it revealed Don Juan Manuel as a master in the\r\nart of prose composition, and as the predecessor of Boccaccio in the\r\nprovince of romantic narrative. The _Cento novelle antiche_ are earlier\r\nin date, but these anonymous tales, derived from popular stories\r\ndiffused throughout the world, lack the personal character which Don\r\nJuan lends to all he touches. They are simple, unadorned variants of\r\nfolk-lore items; _El Conde Lucanor_ is essentially the production of a\r\nconscious artist, deliberative and selective in his methods. Don Juan\r\nManuel has not Boccaccio's festive fancy nor his constructive skill; he\r\nis too persistently didactic and concerned to point a moral; but he\r\nexcels in knowledge of human nature, in the faculty of ironical\r\npresentation, in tolerant wisdom and in luminous conciseness. He\r\nnaturalizes the Eastern apologue in Spain, and by the laconic\r\npicturesqueness of his expression imports a new quality into Spanish\r\nprose which attains its full development in the hands of Juan de Valdés\r\nand Cervantes. Some of his themes are utilized for dramatic purposes by\r\nLope de Vega in _La Pobreza estimada_, by Ruiz de Alarcón in _La Prueba\r\nde las promesas_, by Calderón in _La Vida es sueño_, and by Cañizares in\r\n_Don Juan de Espina en Milán_: there is an evident, though remote,\r\nrelation between the tale of the _mancebo que casó con una mujer muy\r\nfuerte y muy brava_ and _The Taming of the Shrew_; and a more direct\r\nconnexion exists between some of Don Juan Manuel's _enxemplos_ and some\r\nof Anderson's fairy tales.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--_Obras_, edited by P. de Gayangos in the _Biblioteca de\r\n  autores Españoles_, vol. li.; _El Conde Lucanor_ (Leipzig, 1900),\r\n  edited by H.

The _Conde Lucanor_ has\r\n  been translated by J. Eichendorff into German (1840), by A. Puibusque\r\n  into French (1854) and by J. York into English (1868).     (J. F. K.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUAREZ, BENITO PABLO (1806-1872), president of Mexico, was born near\r\nIxtlan, in the state of Oajaca, Mexico, on the 21st of March 1806, of\r\nfull Indian blood. Early left in poverty by the death of his father, he\r\nreceived from a charitable friar a good general education, and\r\nafterwards the means of studying law. Beginning to practise in 1834,\r\nJuarez speedily rose to professional distinction, and in the stormy\r\npolitical life of his time took a prominent part as an exponent of\r\nliberal views. In 1832 he sat in the state legislature; in 1846 he was\r\none of a legislative triumvirate for his native state and a deputy to\r\nthe republican congress, and from 1847 to 1852 he was governor of\r\nOajaca. Banished in 1853 by Santa Anna, he returned to Mexico in 1855,\r\nand joined Alvarez, who, after Santa Anna's defeat, made him minister of\r\njustice. Under Comonfort, who then succeeded Alvarez, Juarez was\r\ngovernor of Oajaca (1855-57), and in 1857 chief justice and secretary of\r\nthe interior; and, when Comonfort was unconstitutionally replaced by\r\nZuloaga in 1858, the chief justice, in virtue of his office, claimed to\r\nbe legal president of the republic. It was not, however, till the\r\nbeginning of 1861 that he succeeded in finally defeating the\r\nunconstitutional party and in being duly elected president by congress.\r\nHis decree of July 1861, suspending for two years all payments on public\r\ndebts of every kind, led to the landing in Mexico of English, Spanish\r\nand French troops. The first two powers were soon induced to withdraw\r\ntheir forces; but the French remained, declared war in 1862, placed\r\nMaximilian upon the throne as emperor, and drove Juarez and his\r\nadherents to the northern limits of the republic. Juarez maintained an\r\nobstinate resistance, which resulted in final success. In 1867\r\nMaximilian was taken at Querétaro, and shot; and in August Juarez was\r\nonce more elected president. His term of office was far from tranquil;\r\ndiscontented generals stirred up ceaseless revolts and insurrections;\r\nand, though he was re-elected in 1871, his popularity seemed to be on\r\nthe wane. He died of apoplexy in the city of Mexico on the 18th of July\r\n1872. He was a statesman of integrity, ability and determination, whose\r\ngood qualities are too apt to be overlooked in consequence of his\r\nconnexion with the unhappy fate of Maximilian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUBA, the name of two kings of Numidia.\r\n\r\nJUBA I. (1st century B.C.), son and successor of Hiempsal, king of\r\nNumidia. During the civil wars at Rome he sided with Pompey, partly from\r\ngratitude because he had reinstated his father on his throne (Appian,\r\n_B.C._, i. 80), and partly from enmity to Caesar, who had insulted him\r\nat Rome by pulling his beard (Suet., _Caesar_, 71). Further, C.\r\nScribonius Curio, Caesar's general in Africa, had openly proposed, 50\r\nB.C., when tribune of the plebs, that Numidia should be sold to\r\ncolonists, and the king reduced to a private station. In 49 Juba\r\ninflicted on the Caesarean army a crushing defeat, in which Curio was\r\nslain (Vell. Pat. ii. 54; Caesar, _B.C._ ii. 40). Juba's attention was\r\ndistracted by a counter invasion of his territories by Bocchus the\r\nyounger and Sittius; but, finding that his lieutenant Sabura was able to\r\ndefend his interests, he rejoined the Pompeians with a large force, and\r\nshared the defeat at Thapsus. Fleeing from the field with the Roman\r\ngeneral M. Petreius, he wandered about as a fugitive. At length, in\r\ndespair, Juba killed Petreius, and sought the aid of a slave in\r\ndespatching himself (46). Juba was a thorough savage; brave,\r\ntreacherous, insolent and cruel. (See NUMIDIA.)\r\n\r\nJUBA II., son of the above. On the death of his father in 46 B.C. he was\r\ncarried to Rome to grace Caesar's triumph. He seems to have received a\r\ngood education under the care of Augustus who, in 29, after Mark\r\nAntony's death, gave him the hand of Cleopatra Selene, daughter of\r\nAntony and Cleopatra, and placed him on his father's throne. In 25,\r\nhowever, he transferred him from Numidia to Mauretania, to which was\r\nadded a part of Gaetulia (see NUMIDIA). Juba seems to have reigned in\r\nconsiderable prosperity, though in A.D. 6 the Gaetulians rose in a\r\nrevolt of sufficient importance to afford the surname Gaetulicus to\r\nCornelius Lentulus Cossus, the Roman general who helped to suppress it.\r\nThe date of Juba's death is by no means certain; it has been put between\r\nA.D. 19 and 24 (Strabo, xvii. 828; Dio Cassius, li. 15; liii. 26;\r\nPlutarch, _Ant._ 87; _Caesar_, 55). Juba, according to Pliny, who\r\nconstantly refers to him, is mainly memorable for his writings. He has\r\nbeen called the African Varro.\r\n\r\n  He wrote many historical and geographical works, of which some seem to\r\n  have been voluminous and of considerable value on account of the\r\n  sources to which their author had access: (1) [Greek: Rhômaikê\r\n  historia]; (2) [Greek: Assyriaka]; (3) [Greek: Libyka]; (4) _De Arabia\r\n  sive De expeditione arabica_; (5) _Physiologa_; (6) _De Euphorbia\r\n  herba_; (7) [Greek: Peri opou]; (8) [Greek: Peri graphikês] ([Greek:\r\n  Peri zôgraphôn]); (9) [Greek: Theatrikê historia]; (10) [Greek:\r\n  Homoiotêtes]; (11) [Greek: Peri phthoras lexeôs]; (12) [Greek:\r\n  Epigramma].\r\n\r\n  Fragments and life in Müller, _Frag. Hist. Graec._, vol. iii.; see\r\n  also Sevin, _Mém. de l'Acad. des Inscriptions_, vol. iv.; Hullemann,\r\n  _De vita et scriptis Jubae_ (1846). For the denarii of Juba II. found\r\n  in 1908 at El Ksar on the coast of Morocco see Dieudonné in _Revue\r\n  Numism_. (1908), pp. 350 seq. They are interesting mainly as throwing\r\n  light on the chronology of the reign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUBA, or JUB, a river of East Africa, exceeding 1000 m. in length,\r\nrising on the S.E. border of the Abyssinian highlands and flowing S.\r\nacross the Galla and Somali countries to the sea. It is formed by the\r\njunction of three streams, all having their source in the mountain range\r\nN.E. of Lake Rudolf which is the water-parting between the Nile basin\r\nand the rivers flowing to the Indian Ocean.\r\n\r\n  Of the three headstreams, the Web, the Ganale and the Daua, the Ganale\r\n  (or Ganana) is the central river and the true upper course of the\r\n  Juba. It has two chief branches, the Black and the Great Ganale. The\r\n  last-named, the most remote source of the river, rises in 7° 30´ N.,\r\n  38° E. at an altitude of about 7500 ft., the crest of the mountains\r\n  reaching another 2500 ft. In its upper course it flows over a rocky\r\n  bed with a swift current and many rapids. The banks are clothed with\r\n  dense jungle and the hills beyond with thorn-bush. Lower down the\r\n  river has formed a narrow valley, 1500 to 2000 ft. below the general\r\n  level of the country. Leaving the higher mountains in about 5° 15´ N.,\r\n  40° E., the Ganale enters a large slightly undulating grass plain\r\n  which extends south of the valley of the Daua and occupies all the\r\n  country eastward to the junction of the two rivers. In this plain the\r\n  Ganale makes a semicircular sweep northward before resuming its\r\n  general S.-E. course. East of 42° E. in 4° 12´ N. it is joined by the\r\n  Web on the left or eastern bank, and about 10 m. lower down the Daua\r\n  enters on the right bank.\r\n\r\n  The Web rises in the mountain chain a little S. and E. of the sources\r\n  of the Ganale, and some 40 m. from its source passes, first, through a\r\n  cañon 500 ft. deep, and then through a series of remarkable\r\n  underground caves hollowed out of a quartz mountain and, with their\r\n  arches and white columns, presenting the appearance of a pillared\r\n  temple. The Daua (or Dawa) is formed by the mountain torrents which\r\n  have their rise S. and W. of the Ganale and is of similar character to\r\n  that river. It has few feeders and none of any size. The descent to\r\n  the open country is somewhat abrupt. In its middle course the Daua has\r\n  cut a deep narrow valley through the plain; lower down it bends N.E.\r\n  to its junction with the Ganale. The river is not deep and can be\r\n  forded in many places; the banks are fringed with thick bush and\r\n  dom-palms. At the junction of the Ganale and the Web the river is\r\n  swift-flowing and 85 yards across; just below the Daua confluence it\r\n  is 200 yds. wide, the altitude here--300 m. in a direct line from the\r\n  source of the Ganale--being only 590 ft.\r\n\r\n  Below the Daua the river, now known as the Juba, receives no tributary\r\n  of importance. It first flows in a valley bounded, especially towards\r\n  the west, by the escarpments of a high plateau, and containing the\r\n  towns of Lugh (in 3° 50´ N., the centre of active trade), Bardera, 387\r\n  m. above the mouth, and Saranli--the last two on opposite sides of the\r\n  stream, in 2° 20´ N., a crossing-place for caravans. Beyond 1° 45´ N.\r\n  the country becomes more level and the course of the river very\r\n  tortuous. On the west a series of small lakes and backwaters receives\r\n  water from the Juba during the rains. Just south of the equator\r\n  channels from the long, branching Lake Deshekwama or Hardinge, fed by\r\n  the Lakdera river, enter from the west, and in 0° 15´ S. the Juba\r\n  enters the sea across a dangerous bar, which has only one fathom of\r\n  water at high tide.\r\n\r\nFrom its mouth to 20 m. above Bardera, where at 2° 35´ N. rapids occur,\r\nthe Juba is navigable by shallow-draught steamers, having a general\r\ndepth of from 4 to 12 ft., though shallower in places. Just above its\r\nmouth it is a fine stream 250 yds. wide, with a current of 2½ knots.\r\nBelow the mountainous region of the headstreams the Juba and its\r\ntributaries flow through a country generally arid away from the banks of\r\nthe streams. The soil is sandy, covered either with thorn-scrub or rank\r\ngrass, which in the rainy season affords herbage for the herds of\r\ncattle, sheep and camels owned by the Boran Gallas and the Somali who\r\ninhabit the district. But by the banks of the lower river the character\r\nof the country changes. In this district, known as Gosha, are\r\nconsiderable tracts of forest, and the level of flood water is higher\r\nthan much of the surrounding land. This low-lying fertile belt stretches\r\nalong the river for about 300 m., but is not more than a mile or two\r\nwide. In the river valley maize, rice, cotton and other crops are\r\ncultivated. From Gobwen, a trading settlement about 3 m. above the mouth\r\nof the Juba, a road runs S.W. to the seaport of Kismayu, 10 m. distant.\r\n\r\nThe lower Juba was ascended in 1865 in a steamer by Baron Karl von der\r\nDecken, who was murdered by Somali at Bardera, but the river system\r\nremained otherwise almost unknown until after 1890. In 1891 a survey of\r\nits lower course was executed by Captain F. G. Dundas of the British\r\nnavy, while in 1892-1893 its headstreams were explored by the Italian\r\nofficers, Captains Vittorio, Bottego and Grixoni, the former of whom\r\ndisproved the supposed connexion of the Omo (see RUDOLF, LAKE) with the\r\nJuba system. It has since been further explored by Prince Eugenio\r\nRuspoli, by Bottego's second expedition (1895), by Donaldson Smith, A.\r\nE. Butter, Captain P. Maud of the British army, and others. The river,\r\nfrom its mouth to the confluence of the Daua and Ganale, forms the\r\nfrontier between the British East Africa protectorate and Italian\r\nSomaliland; and from that point to about 4° 20´ N. the Daua is the\r\nboundary between British and Abyssinian territory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUBBULPORE, or JABALPUR, a city, district, and division of British India\r\nin the Central Provinces. The city is 616 m. N.E. of Bombay by rail, and\r\n220 m. S.W. of Allahabad. Pop. (1901), 90,316. The numerous gorges in\r\nthe neighbouring rocks have been taken advantage of to surround the city\r\nwith a series of lakes, which, shaded by fine trees and bordered by\r\nfantastic crags, add much beauty to the suburbs. The city itself is\r\nmodern, and is laid out in wide and regular streets. A streamlet\r\nseparates the civil station and cantonment from the native quarter; but,\r\nthough the climate is mild, a swampy hollow beneath renders the site\r\nunhealthy for Europeans. Formerly the capital of the Saugor and Nerbudda\r\nterritories, Jubbulpore is now the headquarters of a brigade in the 5th\r\ndivision of the southern army. It is also one of the most important\r\nrailway centres in India, being the junction of the Great Indian\r\nPeninsula and the East Indian systems. It has a steam cotton-mill. The\r\ngovernment college educates for the science course of the Allahabad\r\nUniversity, and also contains law and engineering classes; there are\r\nthree aided high schools, a law class, an engineering class and normal\r\nschools for male and female teachers. A native association, established\r\nin 1869, supports an orphanage, with help from government. A zenana\r\nmission manages 13 schools for girls. Waterworks were constructed in\r\n1882.\r\n\r\nThe DISTRICT OF JUBBULPORE lies on the watershed between the Nerbudda\r\nand the Son, but mostly within the valley of the former river, which\r\nhere runs through the famous gorge known as the Marble rocks, and falls\r\n30 ft. over a rocky ledge (the _Dhuan dhar_, or \"misty shoot\"). Area,\r\n3912 sq. m. It consists of a long narrow plain running north-east and\r\nsouth-west, and shut in on all sides by highlands. This plain, which\r\nforms an offshoot from the great valley of the Nerbudda, is covered in\r\nits western and southern portions by a rich alluvial deposit of black\r\ncotton-soil. At Jubbulpore city the soil is sandy, and water plentiful\r\nnear the surface. The north and east belong to the Ganges and Jumna\r\nbasins, the south and west to the Nerbudda basin. In 1901 the population\r\nwas 680,585, showing a decrease of 9% since 1891, due to the results of\r\nfamine. The principal crops are wheat, rice, pulse and oil-seeds. A good\r\ndeal of iron-smelting with charcoal is carried on in the forests,\r\nmanganese ore is found, and limestone is extensively quarried. The\r\ndistrict is traversed by the main railway from Bombay to Calcutta, and\r\nby new branches of two other lines which meet at Katni junction.\r\nJubbulpore suffered severely in the famine of 1896-1897, the distress\r\nbeing aggravated by immigration from the adjoining native states.\r\nFortunately the famine of 1900 was less severely felt.\r\n\r\n  The early history of Jubbulpore is unknown; but inscriptions record\r\n  the existence during the 11th and 12th centuries of a local line of\r\n  princes of that Haihai race which is closely connected with the\r\n  history of Gondwana. In the 16th century the Gond raja of Garha Mandla\r\n  extended his power over fifty-two districts, including the present\r\n  Jubbulpore. During the minority of his grandson, Asaf Khan, the\r\n  viceroy of Kara Manikpur, conquered the Garha principality and held it\r\n  at first as an independent chief. Eventually he submitted to the\r\n  emperor Akbar. The Delhi power, however, enjoyed little more than a\r\n  nominal supremacy; and the princes of Garha Mandla maintained a\r\n  practical independence until their subjugation by the Mahratta\r\n  governors of Saugor in 1781. In 1798 the peshwa granted the Nerbudda\r\n  valley to the Bhonsla princes of Nagpur, who continued to hold the\r\n  district until the British occupied it in 1818.\r\n\r\nThe DIVISION OF JUBBULPORE lies mainly among the Vindhyan and Satpura\r\nhill systems. It comprises the five following districts: Jubbulpore,\r\nSaugor, Damoh, Seoni and Mandla. Area, 18,950 sq. m.; pop. (1901),\r\n2,081,499.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUBÉ, the French architectural term (taken from the imperative of Lat.\r\n_jubere_, to order) for the chancel or choir screen, which in England is\r\nknown as the rood-screen (see ROOD). Above the screen was a gallery or\r\nloft, from which the words \"Jube Domine benedicere\" were spoken by the\r\ndeacon before the reading of the Gospel, and hence probably the name.\r\nOne of the finest _jubés_ in France is that of the church of the\r\nMadeleine at Troyes, in rich flamboyant Gothic. A later example, of the\r\nRenaissance period, c. 1600, is in the church of St Étienne du Mont,\r\nParis. In the Low Countries there are many fine examples in marble, of\r\nwhich one of the most perfect from Bois-le-Duc is now in the Victoria\r\nand Albert Museum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUBILEE (or JUBILE), YEAR OF, in the Bible, the name applied in the\r\nHoliness section of the Priestly Code of the Hexateuch (Lev. xxv.) to\r\nthe observance of every 50th year, determined by the lapse of seven\r\nseven-year periods as a year of perfect rest, when there was to be no\r\nsowing, nor even gathering of the natural products of the field and the\r\nvine. At the beginning of the jubilee-year the liberation of all\r\nIsraelitish slaves and the restoration of ancestral possessions was to\r\nbe proclaimed. As regards the meaning of the name \"jubilee\" (Heb.\r\n_yobel_) modern scholars are agreed that it signifies \"ram\" or \"ram's\r\nhorn.\" \"Year of jubilee\" would then mean the year that is inaugurated by\r\nthe blowing of the ram's horn (Lev. xxv. 9).\r\n\r\nAccording to Lev. xxv. 8-12, at the completion of seven sabbaths of\r\nyears (i.e. 7 × 7 = 49 years) the trumpet of the jubilee is to be\r\nsounded \"throughout the land\" on the 10th day of the seventh month\r\n(Tisri 10), the great Day of Atonement. The 50th year thus announced is\r\nto be \"hallowed,\" i.e. liberty[1] is to be proclaimed everywhere to\r\neveryone, and the people are to return \"every man unto his possession\r\nand unto his family.\" As in the sabbatical year, there is to be no\r\nsowing, nor reaping that which grows of itself, nor gathering of grapes.\r\n\r\nAs regards _real property_ (Lev. xxv. 13-34) the law is that if any\r\nHebrew under pressure of necessity shall alienate his property he is to\r\nget for it a sum of money reckoned according to the number of harvests\r\nto be reaped between the date of alienation and the first jubilee-year:\r\nshould he or any relation desire to redeem the property before the\r\njubilee this can always be done be repaying the value of the harvests\r\nbetween the redemption and the jubilee.\r\n\r\nThis legal enactment, though it is not found (nor anything like it) in\r\nthe earlier collections of laws, is evidently based on (or modified\r\nfrom) an ancient custom which conferred on a near kinsman the right of\r\npre-emption as well as of buying back (cf. Jer. xxxii. 6 sqq.). The\r\ntendency to impose checks upon the alienation of landed property was\r\nexceptionally strong in Israel. The fundamental principle is that the\r\nland is a sacred possession belonging to Yahweh. As such it is not to be\r\nalienated from Yahweh's people, to whom it was originally assigned. In\r\nEzekiel's restoration programme \"crown lands presented by the 'prince'\r\nto any of his officials revert to the crown in the year of liberty (?\r\njubilee year)\"; only to his sons may any portion of his inheritance be\r\nalienated in perpetuity (Ezek. xlvi. 16-18; cf. Code of Hammurabi, § 38\r\nseq.).\r\n\r\nThe same rule applies to dwelling-houses of unwalled villages; the case\r\nis different, however, as regards dwelling-houses in walled cities.\r\nThese may be redeemed within a year after transfer, but if not redeemed\r\nwithin that period they continue permanently in possession of the\r\npurchaser, and this may well be an echo of ancient practice. An\r\nexception to this last rule is made for the houses of the Levites in the\r\nLevitical cities.\r\n\r\nAs regards _property in slaves_ (Lev. xxv. 35-55) the Hebrew whom\r\nnecessity has compelled to sell himself into the service of his brother\r\nHebrew is to be treated as a hired servant and sojourner, and to be\r\nreleased absolutely at the jubilee; non-Hebrew bondmen, on the other\r\nhand, are to be bondmen for ever. But the Hebrew who has sold himself to\r\na stranger or sojourner is entitled to freedom at the year of jubilee,\r\nand further is at any time redeemable by any of his kindred--the\r\nredemption price being regulated by the number of years to run between\r\nthe redemption and the jubilee, according to the ordinary wage of hired\r\nservants. Such were the enactments of the Priestly Code--which, of\r\ncourse, represents the latest legislation of the Pentateuch\r\n(post-exilic). These enactments, in order to be understood rightly, must\r\nbe viewed in relation to the earlier similar provisions in connexion\r\nwith the sabbatical (seventh) year. \"The foundations of Lev. xxv. are\r\nlaid in the ancient provisions of the Book of the Covenant (Exod. xxi. 2\r\nseq.; xxiii. 10 seq.) and in Deuteronomy (xv.). The Book of the Covenant\r\nenjoined that the land should lie fallow and Hebrew slaves be liberated\r\nin the seventh year; Deuteronomy required in addition the remission of\r\ndebts\" (Benzinger). Deuteronomy, it will be noticed, in accordance with\r\nits humanitarian tendency, not only liberates the slave but remits the\r\ndebt. It is evident that these enactments proved impracticable in real\r\nlife (cf. Jer. xxxiv. 8 seq.), and so it became necessary in the later\r\nlegislation of P, represented in the present form of Lev. xxv., to\r\nrelegate them to the 50th year, the year of jubilee. The latter,\r\nhowever, was a purely theoretic development of the Sabbath idea, which\r\ncould never have been reduced to practice (its actual observance would\r\nhave necessitated that for two consecutive years--the 49th and\r\n50th--absolutely nothing could be reaped, while in the 51st only summer\r\nfruits could be obtained, sowing being prohibited in the 50th year).\r\nThat in practice the enactments for the jubilee-year were disregarded is\r\nevidenced by the fact that, according to the unanimous testimony of the\r\nTalmudists and Rabbins, although the jubilee-years were \"reckoned\" they\r\nwere not observed.\r\n\r\nThe conjecture of Kuenen, supported by Wellhausen, that originally Lev.\r\nxxv. 8 seq. had reference to the seventh year is a highly probable one.\r\nThis may be the case also with Ezek. xlvi. 16-18 (cf. Jer. xxxiv. 14). A\r\nlater Rabbinical device for evading the provisions of the law was the\r\n_prosbul_ (ascribed to Hillel)--i.e. a condition made in the presence of\r\nthe judge securing to the creditor the right of demanding repayment at\r\nany time, irrespective of the year of remission. Further enactments\r\nregarding the jubilee are found in Lev. xxvii. 17-25 and Num. xxxvi. 4.\r\n     (W. R. S.; G. H. Bo.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] Heb. _deror_. The same word (_duraru_) is used in the Code of\r\n    Hammurabi in the similar enactment that wife, son or daughter sold\r\n    into slavery for debt are to be restored to _liberty_ in the fourth\r\n    year (§ 117).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUBILEES, BOOK OF, an apocryphal work of the Old Testament. The Book of\r\nJubilees is the most advanced pre-Christian representative of the\r\nMidrashic tendency, which had already been at work in the Old Testament\r\nChronicles. As the chronicler had rewritten the history of Israel and\r\nJudah from the standpoint of the Priests' Code, so our author re-edited\r\nfrom the Pharisaic standpoint of his time the history of the world from\r\nthe creation to the publication of the Law on Sinai. His work\r\nconstitutes the oldest commentary in the world on Genesis and part of\r\nExodus, an enlarged Targum on these books, in which difficulties in the\r\nbiblical narration are solved, gaps supplied, dogmatically offensive\r\nelements removed and the genuine spirit of later Judaism infused into\r\nthe primitive history of the world.\r\n\r\n_Titles of the Book._--The book is variously entitled. First, it is\r\nknown as [Greek: ta Iôbêlaia, hoi Iôbêlaioi], Heb. [Hebrew: haiuvalim].\r\nThis name is admirably adapted to our book, as it divides into jubilee\r\nperiods of forty-nine years each the history of the world from the\r\ncreation to the legislation on Sinai. Secondly, it is frequently\r\ndesignated \"The Little Genesis,\" [Greek: hê leptê Genesis] or [Greek: hê\r\nMikrogenesis], Heb. [Hebrew: bereshit zutta]. This title may have arisen\r\nfrom its dealing more fully with details and minutiae than the biblical\r\nwork. For the other names by which it is referred to, such as _The\r\nApocalypse of Moses_, _The Testament of Moses_, _The Book of Adam's\r\nDaughters_ and the _Life of Adam_, the reader may consult Charles's _The\r\nBook of Jubilees_, pp. xvii.-xx.\r\n\r\n_Object._--The object of our author was the defence and exposition of\r\nJudaism from the Pharisaic standpoint of the 2nd century B.C. against\r\nthe disintegrating effects of Hellenism. In his elaborate defence of\r\nJudaism our author glorifies circumcision and the sabbath, the bulwarks\r\nof Judaism, as heavenly ordinances, the sphere of which was so far\r\nextended as to embrace Israel on earth. The Law, as a whole, was to our\r\nauthor the realization in time of what was in a sense timeless and\r\neternal. Though revealed in time it was superior to time. Before it had\r\nbeen made known in sundry portions to the fathers, it had been kept in\r\nheaven by the angels, and to its observance there was no limit in time\r\nor in eternity. Our author next defends Judaism by his glorification of\r\nIsrael. Whereas the various nations of the Gentiles were subject to\r\nangels, Israel was subject to God alone. Israel was God's son, and not\r\nonly did the nation stand in this relation to God, but also its\r\nindividual members. Israel received circumcision as a sign that they\r\nwere the Lord's, and this privilege of circumcision they enjoyed in\r\ncommon with the two highest orders of angels. Hence Israel was to unite\r\nwith God and these two orders in the observance of the sabbath. Finally\r\nthe destinies of the world were bound up with Israel. The world was\r\nrenewed in the creation of the true man Jacob, and its final renewal was\r\nto synchronize with the setting-up of God's sanctuary in Zion and the\r\nestablishment of the Messianic kingdom. In this kingdom the Gentiles had\r\nneither part nor lot.\r\n\r\n  _Versions: Greek, Syriac, Ethiopic and Latin._--Numerous fragments of\r\n  the Greek Version have come down to us in Justin Martyr, Origen,\r\n  Diodorus of Antioch, Isidore of Alexandria, Epiphanius, John of\r\n  Malala, Syncellus and others. This version was the parent of the\r\n  Ethiopic and Latin. The Ethiopic Version is most accurate and\r\n  trustworthy, and indeed, as a rule, slavishly literal. It has\r\n  naturally suffered from the corruptions incident to transmission\r\n  through MSS. Thus dittographies are frequent and lacunae of occasional\r\n  occurrence, but the version is singularly free from the glosses and\r\n  corrections of unscrupulous scribes. The Latin Version, of which about\r\n  one-fourth has been preserved, is where it exists of almost equal\r\n  value with the Ethiopic. It has, however, suffered more at the hands\r\n  of correctors. Notwithstanding, it attests a long array of passages in\r\n  which it preserves the true text over against corruptions or omissions\r\n  in the Ethiopic Version. Finally, as regards the Syriac Version, the\r\n  evidence for its existence is not conclusive. It is based on the fact\r\n  that a British Museum MS. contains a Syriac fragment entitled \"Names\r\n  of the wives of the Patriarchs according to the Hebrew Book of\r\n  Jubilees.\"\r\n\r\n  _The Ethiopic and Latin Versions: Translations from the Greek._--The\r\n  Ethiopic Version is translated from the Greek, for Greek words such as\r\n  [Greek: drys, balanos, lips], &c., are transliterated in the Greek.\r\n  Secondly, many passages must be retranslated into Greek before we can\r\n  discover the source of the various corruptions. And finally, proper\r\n  names are transliterated as they appear in Greek and not in Hebrew.\r\n  That the Latin is also a translation from the Greek is no less\r\n  obvious. Thus in xxxix. 12 _timoris_ = [Greek: deilias], corrupt for\r\n  [Greek: douleias]; in xxxviii. 13 _honorem_ = [Greek: timên], but\r\n  [Greek: timên] should here have been rendered by _tributum_, as the\r\n  Ethiopic and the context require; in xxxii. 26, _celavit_ = [Greek:\r\n  ekrypse], corrupt for [Greek: egrapse] (so Ethiopic).\r\n\r\n  _The Greek a Translation from the Hebrew._--The early date of our\r\n  book--the 2nd century B.C.--and its place of composition speak for a\r\n  Semitic original, and the evidence bearing on this subject is\r\n  conclusive. But the question at once arises, was the original Aramaic\r\n  or Hebrew? Certain proper names in the Latin Version ending in -_in_\r\n  seem to bespeak an Aramaic original, as Cettin, Filistin, &c. But\r\n  since in all these cases the Ethiopic transliterations end in -_m_ and\r\n  not in -_n_, it is not improbable that the Aramaism in the Latin\r\n  Version is due to the translator, who, it has been concluded on other\r\n  grounds, was a Palestinian Jew.[1] The grounds, on the other hand, for\r\n  a Hebrew original are weighty and numerous. (1) A work which claims to\r\n  be from the hand of Moses would naturally be in Hebrew, for Hebrew\r\n  according to our author was the sacred and national language. (2) The\r\n  revival of the national spirit of a nation is universally, so far as\r\n  we know, accompanied by a revival of the national language. (3) The\r\n  text must be retranslated into Hebrew in order to explain\r\n  unintelligible expressions and restore the true text. One instance\r\n  will sufficiently illustrate this statement. In xliii. 11 a certain\r\n  Ethiopic expression = [Greek: en emoi], which is a mistranslation of\r\n  [Hebrew: bi]; for [Hebrew: bi] in this context, as we know from the\r\n  parallel passage in Gen. xliv. 18, which our text reproduces almost\r\n  verbally, = [Greek: deomai]. We might observe here that our text\r\n  attests the presence of dittographies already existing in the Hebrew\r\n  text. (4) Hebraisms survive in the Ethiopic and Latin Versions. In the\r\n  former nûha in iv. 4, is a corrupt transliteration of [Hebrew: na]. In\r\n  the Latin eligere in te in xxii. 10 is a reproduction of [Hebrew:\r\n  behar be] and _in qua ... in ipsa_ in xix. 8 = [Hebrew: ba ... asher].\r\n  This idiom could, of course, be explained on the hypothesis of an\r\n  Aramaic original. (5) Many paronomasiae discover themselves on\r\n  retranslation into Hebrew.\r\n\r\n  _Textual Affinities._--A minute study of the text shows that it\r\n  attests an independent form of the Hebrew text of the Pentateuch. Thus\r\n  it agrees at times with the Samaritan, or Septuagint, or Syriac, or\r\n  Vulgate, or even with Onkelos against all the rest. To be more exact,\r\n  our book represents some form of the Hebrew text of the Pentateuch\r\n  midway between the forms presupposed by the Septuagint and the Syriac;\r\n  for it agrees more frequently with the Septuagint, or with\r\n  combinations into which the Septuagint enters, than with any other\r\n  single authority, or with any combination excluding the Septuagint.\r\n  Next to the Septuagint it agrees most often with the Syriac or with\r\n  combinations into which the Syriac enters. On the other hand, its\r\n  independence of the Septuagint is shown in a large number of passages,\r\n  where it has the support of the Samaritan and Massoretic, or of these\r\n  with various combinations of the Syriac Vulgate and Onkelos. From\r\n  these and other considerations we may conclude that the textual\r\n  evidence points to the composition of our book at some period between\r\n  250 B.C. and A.D. 100, and at a time nearer the earlier date than the\r\n  later.\r\n\r\n_Date._--The book was written between 135 B.C. and the year of\r\nHyrcanus's breach with the Pharisees. This conclusion is drawn from the\r\nfollowing facts:--(1) The book was written during the pontificate of the\r\nMaccabean family, and not earlier than 135 B.C. For in xxxii. 1 Levi is\r\ncalled a \"priest of the Most High God.\" Now the only high priests who\r\nbore this title were the Maccabean, who appear to have assumed it as\r\nreviving the order of Melchizedek when they displaced the Zadokite order\r\nof Aaron. Jewish tradition ascribes the assumption of this title to John\r\nHyrcanus. It was retained by his successors down to Hyrcanus II. (2) It\r\nwas written before 96 B.C. or some years earlier in the reign of John\r\nHyrcanus; for since our author is of the strictest sect a Pharisee and\r\nat the same time an upholder of the Maccabean pontificate, Jubilees\r\ncannot have been written after 96 when the Pharisees and Alexander\r\nJannaeus came to open strife. Nay more, it cannot have been written\r\nafter the open breach between Hyrcanus and the Pharisees, when the\r\nformer joined the Sadducean party.\r\n\r\nThe above conclusions are confirmed by a large mass of other evidence\r\npostulating the same date. We may, however, observe that our book points\r\nto the period already past--of stress and persecution that preceded the\r\nrecovery of national independence under the Maccabees, and presupposes\r\nas its historical background the most flourishing period of the\r\nMaccabean hegemony.\r\n\r\n_Author._--Our author was a Pharisee of the straitest sect. He\r\nmaintained the everlasting validity of the law, he held the strictest\r\nviews on circumcision, the sabbath, and the duty of shunning all\r\nintercourse with the Gentiles; he believed in angels and in a blessed\r\nimmortality. In the next place he was an upholder of the Maccabean\r\npontificate. He glorifies Levi's successors as high-priests and civil\r\nrulers, and applies to them the title assumed by the Maccabean princes,\r\nthough he does not, like the author of the Testaments of the Twelve\r\nPatriarchs, expect the Messiah to come forth from among them. He may\r\nhave been a priest.\r\n\r\n_The Views of the Author on the Messianic Kingdom and the Future\r\nLife._--According to our author the Messianic kingdom was to be brought\r\nabout gradually by the progressive spiritual development of man and a\r\ncorresponding transformation of nature. Its members were to reach the\r\nlimit of 1000 years in happiness and peace. During its continuance the\r\npowers of evil were to be restrained, and the last judgment was\r\napparently to take place at its close. As regards the doctrine of a\r\nfuture life, our author adopts a position novel for a Palestinian\r\nwriter. He abandons the hope of a resurrection of the body. The souls of\r\nthe righteous are to enjoy a blessed immortality after death. This is\r\nthe earliest attested instance of this expectation in the last two\r\ncenturies B.C.\r\n\r\n  LITERATURE.--_Ethiopic Text and Translations_: This text was first\r\n  edited by Dillmann from two MSS. in 1859, and in 1895 by R.

C.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] In the Ethiopic Version in xxi. 12 it should be observed that in\r\n    the list of the twelve trees suitable for burning on the altar\r\n    several are transliterated Aramaic names of trees. But in a late\r\n    Hebrew work (2nd century B.C.) the popular names of such objects\r\n    would naturally be used. In certain cases the Hebrew may have been\r\n    forgotten, or, where the tree was of late introduction, been\r\n    non-existent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUBILEE YEAR, an institution in the Roman Catholic Church, observed\r\nevery twenty-fifth year, from Christmas to Christmas. During its\r\ncontinuance plenary indulgence is obtainable by all the faithful, on\r\ncondition of their penitently confessing their sins and visiting certain\r\nchurches a stated number of times, or doing an equivalent amount of\r\nmeritorious work. The institution dates from the time of Boniface VIII.,\r\nwhose bull _Antiquorum habet fidem_ is dated the 22nd of February 1300.\r\nThe circumstances in which it was promulgated are related by a\r\ncontemporary authority, Jacobus Cajetanus, according to whose account\r\n(\"Relatio de centesimo s. jubilaeo anno\" in the _Bibliotheca Patrum_) a\r\nrumour spread through Rome at the close of 1299 that every one visiting\r\nSt Peter's on the 1st of January 1300 would receive full absolution. The\r\nresult was an enormous influx of pilgrims to Rome, which stirred the\r\npope's attention. Nothing was found in the archives, but an old peasant\r\n107 years of age avowed that his father had been similarly benefited a\r\ncentury previously. The bull was then issued, and the pilgrims became\r\neven more numerous, to the profit of both clergy and citizens.\r\nOriginally the churches of St Peter and St Paul in Rome were the only\r\njubilee churches, but the privilege was afterwards extended to the\r\nLateran Church and that of Sta Maria Maggiore, and it is now shared also\r\nfor the year immediately following that of the Roman jubilee by a number\r\nof specified provincial churches. At the request of the Roman people,\r\nwhich was supported by St Bridget of Sweden and by Petrarch, Clement VI.\r\nin 1343 appointed, by the bull _Unigenitus Dei filius_, that the jubilee\r\nshould recur every fifty years instead of every hundred years as had\r\nbeen originally contemplated in the constitution of Boniface; Urban VI.,\r\nwho was badly in need of money, by the bull _Salvator noster_ in 1389\r\nreduced the interval still further to thirty-three years (the supposed\r\nduration of the earthly life of Christ); and Paul II. by the bull\r\n_Ineffabilis_ (April 19, 1470) finally fixed it at twenty-five years.\r\nPaul II. also permitted foreigners to substitute for the pilgrimage to\r\nRome a visit to some specified church in their own country and a\r\ncontribution towards the expenses of the Holy Wars. According to the\r\nspecial ritual prepared by Alexander VI. in 1500, the pope on the\r\nChristmas Eve with which the jubilee begins goes in solemn procession to\r\na particular walled-up door (\"Porta aurea\") of St Peter's and knocks\r\nthree times, using at the same time the words of Ps. cxviii. 19\r\n(_Aperite mihi portas justitiae_). The doors are then opened and\r\nsprinkled with holy water, and the pope passes through. A similar\r\nceremony is conducted by cardinals at the other jubilee churches of the\r\ncity. At the close of the jubilee, the special doorway is again built up\r\nwith appropriate solemnities.\r\n\r\n  The last ordinary jubilee was observed in 1900. \"Extraordinary\"\r\n  jubilees are sometimes appointed on special occasions, e.g. the\r\n  accession of a new pope, or that proclaimed by Pope Leo XIII. for the\r\n  12th of March 1881, \"in order to obtain from the mercy of Almighty God\r\n  help and succour in the weighty necessities of the Church, and comfort\r\n  and strength in the battle against her numerous and mighty foes.\"\r\n  These are not so much jubilees in the ordinary sense as special grants\r\n  of plenary indulgences for particular purposes (_Indulgentiae\r\n  plenariae in forma jubilaei_).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJÚCAR, a river of eastern Spain. It rises in the north of the province\r\nof Cuenca, at the foot of the Cerro de San Felipe (5906 ft.), and flows\r\nsouth past Cuenca to the borders of Albacete; here it bends towards the\r\neast, and maintains this direction for the greater part of its remaining\r\ncourse. On the right it is connected with the city of Albacete by the\r\nMaria Cristina canal. After entering Valencia, it receives on the left\r\nits chief tributary the Cabriel, which also rises near the Cerro de San\r\nFelipe, in the Montes Universales. Near Alcira the Júcar turns\r\nsouth-eastward, and then sharply north, curving again to the south-east\r\nbefore it enters the Mediterranean Sea at Cullera, after a total course\r\nof 314 m. Its estuary forms the harbour of Cullera, and its lower waters\r\nare freely utilized for purposes of irrigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUD, LEO (1482-1542), known to his contemporaries as Meister Leu, Swiss\r\nreformer, was born in Alsace and educated at Basel, where after a\r\ncourse in medicine he turned to the study of theology. This change was\r\ndue to the influence of Zwingli whose colleague at Zürich Jud became\r\nafter serving for four years (1518-1522) as pastor of Einsiedeln. His\r\nchief activity was as a translator; he was the leading spirit in the\r\ntranslation of the Zürich Bible and also made a Latin version of the Old\r\nTestament. He died at Zürich on the 19th of June 1542.\r\n\r\n  See _Life_ by C. Pestalozzi (1860); art. in Herzog-Hauck's\r\n  _Realencyklopädie_, vol. ix.

In Luke and Acts the term is sometimes used loosely to\r\ndenote the whole of western Palestine. The limits of Judaea were never\r\nvery precisely defined and--especially on the northern frontier--varied\r\nfrom time to time. After the death of Herod, Archelaus became ethnarch\r\nof Samaria, Idumea and Judaea, and when he was deposed Judaea was merged\r\nin Syria, being governed by a procurator whose headquarters were in\r\nCaesarea.\r\n\r\n  For a description of the natural features of the country see\r\n  PALESTINE; for its history see JEWS and JUDAH. Cf. T. Mommsen, _The\r\n  Provinces of the Roman Empire_, ch. xi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUDAH, a district of ancient Palestine, to the south of the kingdom of\r\nIsrael, between the Dead Sea and the Philistine plain. It falls\r\nphysically into three parts: the hill-country from Hebron northwards\r\nthrough Jerusalem; the lowland (Heb. _Shephelah_) on the west; and the\r\nsteppes or \"dry land\" (Heb. _Negeb_) on the south. The district is one\r\nof striking contrasts, with a lofty and stony table-land in the centre\r\n(which reaches a height of 3300 ft. just north of Hebron), with a\r\nstrategically important valley dividing the central mountains from the\r\nlowland, and with the most desolate of tracts to the east (by the Dead\r\nSea) and south. Some parts, especially around Hebron, are extremely\r\nfertile, but the land as a whole has the characteristics of the southern\r\nwilderness--the so-called \"desert\" is not a sterile Sahara--and was more\r\nfitted for pastoral occupations; see further G. A. Smith, _Hist. Geog.\r\nHoly Land_, chs. x.-xv. Life in ancient Judah is frequently depicted in\r\nthe Bible, but much of the Judaean history is obscure. In the days of\r\nthe old Hebrew monarchy there were periods of conflict and rivalry\r\nbetween Judah and Israel--even times when the latter incorporated, or at\r\nleast claimed supremacy over, the former. Later, from the 5th century\r\nB.C. there was a breach between the Jews (the name is derived from\r\nJudah) and the Samaritans (q.v.). The intervening years after the fall\r\nof Samaria (722 B.C.), and after the destruction of Jerusalem (586\r\nB.C.), were probably marked by closer intercourse, similar to the period\r\nof union in the popular traditions relating to the pre-monarchical age.\r\nThe course of Judaean history was conditioned, also, by the proximity of\r\nthe Philistines in the west, Moab in the east, and by Edom and other\r\nsouthern peoples extending from North Arabia to the delta of the Nile.\r\nJudah's stormy history, continued under Greek and Roman domination,\r\nreached its climax in the birth of Christianity, and ended with the fall\r\nof Jerusalem in A.D. 70 (see JEWS, PALESTINE).\r\n\r\n  In conformity with ancient methods of genealogy (q.v.), Judah is\r\n  traced back to a son of Jacob or Israel by Leah and along with other\r\n  \"tribes\" (Dan, Levi, Simeon, &c.) is included under the collective\r\n  term Israel. Thus it shares the general traditions of the Israelites,\r\n  although Judah appears as an individual in the story of his \"brother\"\r\n  Joseph (on ch. xxxvii. seq., see GENESIS). Its boundaries in Joshua\r\n  xv. are manifestly artificial or imaginary; they include the\r\n  Philistines and number places which are elsewhere ascribed to Simeon\r\n  or Dan. The origin of the name (_Yehudah_) is quite uncertain; the\r\n  interpretation \"praised\" is suggested in Gen. xxix. 35 (cf; xlix. 8\r\n  seq.), but some connexion with allied names, as Yehud (Yahudiya, E. of\r\n  Jaffa), or Ehud (a Benjamite clan) seems more probable. That Judah,\r\n  whatever its original connotation, underwent development through the\r\n  incorporation of other clans appears from 1 Chron. ii., iv., where it\r\n  is found to contain a large element of non-Israelite population whose\r\n  names find analogies or parallels in Simeonite, Edomite and other\r\n  southern lists.[1] Indeed, underlying the account of the Israelite\r\n  exodus (q.v.) there are traces of a separate movement of certain\r\n  clans--apart from the Israelite invasion of Palestine--who are\r\n  ultimately found in the south of Judah; and the traditions in\r\n  Chronicles themselves allow the view that the incorporation of these\r\n  elements began under David, when Judah first occupies a prominent\r\n  position in biblical history (cf. Cheyne, _Ency. Bib._, col. 2618\r\n  seq., and see CALEB, JERAHMEEL, KENITES). But such movements were not\r\n  necessarily limited to one single period, and the evidence connecting\r\n  (a) the non-Israelite clans of Judah with Levites, and (b) both with\r\n  the south, is found in narratives referring to several different ages\r\n  and might point to an unceasing relationship with the south. On the\r\n  other hand, clans, which in the traditions of David's time were in the\r\n  south of Judah, about five hundred years later (in the exile) are\r\n  found near Jerusalem (e.g. Caleb), so that either these survived the\r\n  strenuous vicissitudes of half a millennium or all perspective of\r\n  their early history has been lost. In Gen. xxxviii. a curious\r\n  narrative points to the separation of Judah \"from his brethren\" and\r\n  his marriage with Shua the Canaanite; two sons Er and Onan perish and\r\n  the third Shelah survives. From Judah and Er's widow Tamar are derived\r\n  Perez and Zerah, and these with Shelah appear in post-exilic times as\r\n  the three representative families of Judah (Neh. xi. 4-6; 1 Chron. ix.\r\n  4-6). This story, amid a number of other motives, appears to reflect\r\n  the growth of the tribe of Judah and its fluctuations, but that the\r\n  reference is to any very early period is unlikely, partly because the\r\n  interest of the story is in post-exilic families, and partly because\r\n  the scenes (Adullam, Chezib and Timnah) overlap with David's own\r\n  fights between Hebron and Jerusalem (2 Sam. xxi. xxiii.; see DAVID,\r\n  _ad fin._).[2] Even David's conquest of Jerusalem (2 Sam. v.)\r\n  conflicts both with the statement of its capture by Judah many years\r\n  previously (Judges i. 8), and with the traditions of the Israelite\r\n  heroes Joshua and Saul. Consequently, the few surviving data are too\r\n  uncertain for any decisive conclusions regarding the origin of the\r\n  tribe of Judah. Judah as a kingdom may have taken its name from a\r\n  limited district, in which case its growth finds a parallel in the\r\n  extension of the name Samaria from the city to the province. The\r\n  location of Yehud and Ehud in the light of 1 Kings iv. 8-19 (perhaps\r\n  the subdivisions of the Israelite kingdom, see SOLOMON), would\r\n  necessitate the assumption of a violent separation from the north;\r\n  this, however, is quite conceivable (see JEWS, §§ 11-13). On the\r\n  bearing of South Judah upon the historical criticism of the Old\r\n  Testament, see especially N. Schmidt, _Hibbert Journal_ (1908), pp.\r\n  322-342, \"The Jerahmeel Theory and the Historic Importance of the\r\n  Negeb, with some account of personal exploration of the country\"; also\r\n  JEWS, § 20.

He is always enumerated last with the special\r\nmention of the fact that he was the betrayer of Jesus. If the generally\r\naccepted explanation of his surname (\"man of Kerioth\"; see Josh. xv. 25)\r\nbe correct, he was the only original member of the apostolic band who\r\nwas not a Galilean. The circumstances which led to his admission into\r\nthe apostolic circle are not stated; while the motives by which he was\r\nactuated in enabling the Jewish authorities to arrest Jesus without\r\ntumult have been variously analysed by scholars. According to some (as\r\nDe Quincey in his famous _Essay_) the sole object of Judas was to place\r\nJesus in a position in which He should be compelled to make what had\r\nseemed to His followers the too tardy display of His Messianic power:\r\naccording to others (and this view seems more in harmony with the Gospel\r\nnarratives) Judas was an avaricious and dishonest man, who had already\r\nabused the confidence placed in him (John xii. 6), and who was now\r\nconcerned only with furthering his own ends.\r\n\r\nAs regards the effects of his subsequent remorse and the use to which\r\nhis ill-gotten gains were put, the strikingly apparent discrepancies\r\nbetween the narratives of Matt. xxvii. 3, 10 and Acts i. 18, 19 have\r\nattracted the attention of biblical scholars, ever since Papias, in his\r\nfourth book, of which a fragment has been preserved, discussed the\r\nsubject. The simplest explanation is that they represent different\r\ntraditions, the Gospel narrative being composed with more special\r\nreference to prophetic fulfilments, and being probably nearer the truth\r\nthan the short explanatory note inserted by the author of the Acts (see\r\nBernard, _Expositor_, June 1904, p. 422 seq.). In ecclesiastical legend\r\nand in sacred art Judas Iscariot is generally treated as the very\r\nincarnation of treachery, ingratitude and impiety. The Middle Ages,\r\nafter their fashion, supplied the lacunae in what they deemed his too\r\nmeagre biography. According to the common form of their story, he\r\nbelonged to the tribe of Reuben.[1] Before he was born his mother\r\nCyborea had a dream that he was destined to murder his father, commit\r\nincest with his mother, and sell his God. The attempts made by her and\r\nher husband to avert this curse simply led to its accomplishment. At his\r\nbirth Judas was enclosed in a chest and flung into the sea; picked up on\r\na foreign shore, he was educated at the court until a murder committed\r\nin a moment of passion compelled his flight. Coming to Judaea, he\r\nentered the service of Pontius Pilate as page, and during this period\r\ncommitted the first two of the crimes which had been expressly foretold.\r\nLearning the secret of his birth, he, full of remorse, sought the\r\nprophet who, he had heard, had power on earth to forgive sins. He was\r\naccepted as a disciple and promoted to a position of trust, where\r\navarice, the only vice in which he had hitherto been unpractised,\r\ngradually took possession of his soul, and led to the complete\r\nfulfilment of his evil destiny. This Judas legend, as given by Jacobus\r\nde Voragine, obtained no small popularity; and it is to be found in\r\nvarious shapes in every important literature of Europe.\r\n\r\n  For the history of its genesis and its diffusion the reader may\r\n  consult D'Ancona, _La leggenda di Vergogna e la leggenda di Giuda_\r\n  (1869), and papers by W. Creizenach in Paul and Braune's _Beitr. zur\r\n  Gesch. der deutschen Sprache und Litteratur_, vol. ii. (1875), and\r\n  Victor Diederich in _Russiche Revue_ (1880). Cholevius, in his\r\n  _Geschichte der deutschen Poesie nach ihren antiken Elementen_ (1854),\r\n  pointed out the connexion of the legend with the Oedipus story.\r\n  According to Daub (_Judas Ischariot, oder Betrachtungen über das Böse\r\n  im Verhältniss zum Guten_, 1816, 1818) Judas was \"an incarnation of\r\n  the devil,\" to whom \"mercy and blessedness are alike impossible.\"\r\n\r\n  The popular hatred of Judas has found strange symbolical expression in\r\n  various parts of Christendom. In Corfu, for instance, the people at a\r\n  given signal on Easter Eve throw vast quantities of crockery from\r\n  their windows and roofs into the streets, and thus execute an\r\n  imaginary stoning of Judas (see Kirkwall, _Ionian Islands_, ii. 47).\r\n  At one time (according to Mustoxidi, _Delle cose corciresi_) the\r\n  tradition prevailed that the traitor's house and country villa existed\r\n  in the island, and that his descendants were to be found among the\r\n  local Jews.\r\n\r\n  Details in regard to some Judas legends and superstitions are given in\r\n  _Notes and Queries_, 2nd series, v., vi. and vii.; 3rd series, vii.;\r\n  4th series, i.; 5th series, vi. See also a paper by Professor Rendel\r\n  Harris entitled \"Did Judas really commit suicide?\" in the _American\r\n  Journal of Philology_ (July 1900). Matthew Arnold's poem \"St Brandan\"\r\n  gives fine expression to the old story that, on account of an act of\r\n  charity done to a leper at Joppa, Judas was allowed an hour's respite\r\n  from hell once a year.     (G. Mi.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] Other forms make him a Danite, and consider the passage in\r\n    Genesis (xlix. 17) a prophecy of the traitor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUDAS-TREE, the _Cercis siliquastrum_ of botanists, belonging to the\r\nsection _Caesalpineae_ of the natural order Leguminosae. It is a native\r\nof the south of France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece and Asia Minor,\r\nand forms a handsome low tree with a flat spreading head. In Spring it\r\nis covered with a profusion of purplish-pink flowers, which appear\r\nbefore the leaves. The flowers have an agreeable acid taste, and are\r\neaten mixed with salad or made into fritters. The tree was frequently\r\nfigured by the older herbalists. One woodcut by Castor Durante has the\r\nfigure of Judas Iscariot suspended from one of the branches,\r\nillustrating the popular tradition regarding this tree. A second\r\nspecies, _C. canadensis_, is common in North America from Canada to\r\nAlabama and eastern Texas, and differs from the European species in its\r\nsmaller size and pointed leaves. The flowers are also used in salads and\r\nfor making pickles, while the branches are used to dye wool a nankeen\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUDD, SYLVESTER (1813-1853) American Unitarian clergyman and author, was\r\nborn in Westhampton, Massachusetts, on the 23rd of July 1813. He bore\r\nthe same name as his father and grandfather; the former (1789-1860) made\r\nan especial study of local history of the towns of the Connecticut\r\nvalley, and wrote a _History of Hadley_ (1863). The son lived in\r\nNorthampton after his tenth year, was converted in a revival there in\r\n1826, graduated from Yale in 1836, and taught in 1836 at Templeton,\r\nMass., where he first met Unitarians and soon found the solution of his\r\ntheological difficulties in their views. He entered the Harvard divinity\r\nschool, from which he graduated in 1840. In the same year he was\r\nordained pastor of the Unitarian church of Augusta, Maine, where he died\r\non the 26th of January 1853. His widest reputation was as the author of\r\n_Margaret, a Tale of the Real and the Ideal, including Sketches of a\r\nplace not before described, called Mons Christi_ (1845; revised 1851),\r\nwritten to exhibit the errors of Calvinistic and all trinitarian\r\ntheology, and the evils of war, intemperance, capital punishment, the\r\nprison system of the time, and the national treatment of the Indians.\r\nThis story, published anonymously, attracted much attention by its true\r\ndescriptions of New England life and scenery as well as by its author's\r\nearnest purpose. _Richard Edney and the Governor's Family_ (1850) is in\r\nmuch the same vein as _Margaret_. A poem entitled _Philo, an Evangeliad_\r\n(1850) is a versified defence of Unitarianism. He published, besides,\r\n_The Church, in a Series of Discourses_ (1854). As a preacher and pastor\r\nhe urged the desirability of infant baptism. He lectured frequently on\r\ninternational peace and opposed slavery.\r\n\r\nSee Arethusa Hall, _Life and Character of the Rev. Sylvester Judd_\r\n(Boston, 1857) published anonymously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUDE, THE GENERAL EPISTLE OF, a book of the New Testament. As with the\r\nepistle of James, the problems of the writing centre upon the\r\nsuperscription, which addresses in Pauline phraseology (1 Thess. i. 4; 2\r\nThess. ii. 13; Rom. i. 7; 1 Cor. 1. 2) the Christian world in general in\r\nthe name of \"Jude, the brother of James\" (Matt. xiii. 55; Mark vi. 3).\r\nThe historical situation depicted must then fall within the lifetime of\r\nthis Judas, whose two grandchildren Zoker and James (Hegesippus _ap._\r\nPhil. Sidetes) by their testimony before the authorities brought to an\r\nend the (Palestinian) persecution of Domitian (Hegesippus _ap._ Eus. _H.\r\nE._ iii. 20, 7). These two grandsons of Judas thereafter \"lived until\r\nthe time of Trajan,\" ruling the churches \"because they had (thus) been\r\nwitnesses (martyrs) and were also relatives of the Lord.\" But in that\r\ncase we must either reject the testimony of the same Hegesippus that up\r\nto their death, and that of Symeon son of Clopas, successor in the\r\nJerusalem see of James the Lord's brother, \"who suffered martyrdom at\r\nthe age of one hundred and twenty years while Trajan was emperor and\r\nAtticus governor,\" \"the church (universal) had remained a pure and\r\nuncorrupted virgin\" free from \"the folly of heretical teachers\"; or else\r\nwe must reject the superscription, which presents the grandfather in\r\nvehement conflict with the very heresies in question. For the testimony\r\nof Hegesippus is explicit that at the time of the arrest of Zoker and\r\nJames they were all who survived of the kindred of the Lord. True, there\r\nis confusion in the narrative of Hegesippus, and even a probability that\r\nthe martyrdom of Symeon dated under Trajan really took place in the\r\npersecution of Domitian, before the arrest of the grandsons of Jude, for\r\napart from the alleged age of Symeon (the traditional Jewish limit of\r\nhuman life, Gen. vi. 3, Deut. xxxiv. 7), the cause of his apprehension\r\n\"on the ground that he was _a descendant of David_ and a Christian\"\r\n(Hegesippus _ap._ Eus. _H. E._ iii. 32, 3) is inconsistent with both the\r\nprevious statements regarding the \"martyrdom\" of Zoker and James, that\r\nthey were cited as the only surviving Christian Davididae, and that the\r\npersecution on this ground collapsed through the manifest absurdity of\r\nthe accusation. But even if we date the rise of heresies in the reign of\r\nDomitian instead of Trajan,[1] the attributing of this epistle against\r\ncorrupting heresy to \"Jude the brother of James\" will still be\r\nincompatible with the statements of Hegesippus, our only informant\r\nregarding his later history.\r\n\r\nThe Greek of Jude is also such as to exclude the idea of authorship in\r\nPalestine by an unschooled Galilean, at an early date in church history.\r\nAs F. H. Chase has pointed out: (1) the terms [Greek: klêtoi, sôtêria,\r\npistis], have attained their later technical sense; (2) \"the writer is\r\nsteeped in the language of the LXX.,\" employing its phraseology\r\nindependently of other N.T. writers, and not that of the canonical books\r\nalone, but of the broader non-Palestinian canon; (3) \"he has at his\r\ncommand a large stock of stately, sonorous, sometimes poetical words,\"\r\nproving him a \"man of some culture, and, as it would seem, not without\r\nacquaintance with Greek writers.\"\r\n\r\nIf the superscription be not from the hand of the actual brother of\r\nJesus, the question may well be asked why some apostolic name was not\r\nchosen which might convey greater authority? The answer is to be found\r\nin the direction toward which the principal defenders of orthodoxy in\r\n100-150 turned for \"the deposit of the faith\" (Jude 3) in its purity.\r\nThe Pastoral Epistles point to \"the pattern of sound words, even the\r\nsayings of our Lord Jesus Christ.\" (1 Tim. vi. 3, &c.), as the arsenal\r\nof orthodoxy against the same foe (with 1 Tim. vi. 3-10; cf. Jude 4, 11,\r\n16, 18 seq.). Ignatius's motto is to \"be inseparable from Jesus Christ\r\nand from your bishop\" (_ad Trall._ vii.), Polycarp's, to \"turn unto the\r\nword delivered unto us from the beginning\" (cf. Jude 3; 1 John ii. 7,\r\niii. 23, iv. 21), \"the oracles of the Lord,\" which the false teachers\r\n\"pervert to their own lusts.\" Papias, his [Greek: hetairos] (Irenaeus),\r\nturns in fact from \"the vain talk of the many,\" and from the \"alien\r\ncommandments\" to such as were \"delivered by the Lord to the faith,\"\r\noffering to the Christian world his _Interpretation of the Lord's\r\nOracles_ based upon personal inquiry from those who \"came his way,\" who\r\ncould testify as to apostolic tradition. Hegesippus, after a journey to\r\nall the principal seats of Christian tradition, testifies that all are\r\nholding to the true doctrine as transmitted at the original seat, where\r\nit was witnessed first by the apostles and afterwards by the kindred of\r\nthe Lord and \"witnesses\" of the first generation. All these writers in\r\none form or other revert to the historic tradition against the licence\r\nof innovators. Hegesippus indicates plainly the seat of its authority.\r\nFor the period before the adoption of a written standard the resort was\r\nnot so much to \"apostles\" as to \"disciples\" and \"witnesses.\" The appeal\r\nwas to \"those who from the beginning had been eyewitnesses and ministers\r\nof the word\" (Luke i. 2); and these were to be found primarily (until\r\nthe complete destruction of that church during the revolt of Barcochebas\r\nand its suppression by Hadrian) in the mother community in Jerusalem\r\n(cf. Acts xv. 2). Its life is the measure of the period of oral\r\ntradition, whose requiem is sung by Papias. Hegesippus (_ap._ Eus. _H.\r\nE._ iii. 32, 7 seq.) looks back to it as the safe guardian of the\r\ndeposit \"of the faith\" against all the depredations of heresy which\r\n\"when the sacred college of apostles had suffered death in various\r\nforms, and the generation of those that had been deemed worthy to hear\r\nthe inspired wisdom with their own ears had passed away ... attempted\r\nthenceforth with a bold face, to proclaim, in opposition to the\r\npreaching of the truth, 'the knowledge which is falsely so-called\r\n([Greek: pseudônymos gnôsis]).'\" For an appeal like that of our epistle\r\nto the authority of the past against the moral laxity and antinomian\r\nteaching of degenerate Pauline churches in the Greek world, the natural\r\nresort after Paul himself (Pastoral Epp.) would be the \"kindred of the\r\nLord\" who were the \"leaders and witnesses in every church\" in Palestine.\r\nDoubtless the framer of Jude 1 would have preferred the aegis of \"James\r\nthe Lord's brother,\" if this, like that of Paul, had not been already\r\nappropriated. Failing this, the next most imposing was \"Judas, the\r\nbrother of James.\"\r\n\r\nThe superscription in the case of Jude, unlike that of James, takes hold\r\nof the substance of the book. Verse 3 and the farewell (v. 24 seq.) show\r\nthat Jude was composed from the start as an \"epistle.\" If this\r\nappearance be not fallacious, the obvious relation between the two\r\nsuperscriptions will be best explained by the supposition that the\r\nauthor of Jude gave currency to the existing homily (James) before\r\ncomposing under the pseudonym of Jude. On the interconnexion of the two\r\nsee Sieffert, _s.v._ \"Judasbrief\" in Hauck, _Realencykl._ vol. ix.\r\n\r\nJudas is conceived as cherishing the intention of discussing for the\r\nbenefit of the Christian world (for no mere local church is addressed)\r\nthe subject of \"our common salvation\" (the much desiderated\r\nauthoritative definition of the orthodox faith), but diverted from this\r\npurpose by the growth of heresy.\r\n\r\nFew writings of this compass afford more copious evidence of date in\r\ntheir literary affinities. The references to Enoch (principally ver. 14\r\nseq. = _Eth. En._ i. 9, but cf. F. H. Chase, _s.v._ \"Jude\" in Hastings's\r\n_Dict. Bible_) and the _Assumption of Moses_ (v. 9) have more a\r\ngeographical than a chronological bearing, the stricter canon of\r\nPalestine excluding these apocryphal books of 90 B.C. to A.D. 40; but\r\nthe Pauline writings are freely employed, especially 1 Cor. x. 1-13,\r\nRom. xvi. 25 seq., and probably Eph. and Col. Moreover, the author\r\nexplicitly refers to the apostolic age as already past, and to the\r\nfulfilment of the Pauline prediction (1 Tim. iv. 1 sqq.) of the advent\r\nof heresy (v. 17 seq.). The Pauline doctrine of \"grace\" has been\r\nperverted to lasciviousness, as by the heretics whom Polycarp opposes\r\n(_Ep. Polyc._ vii.), and this doctrine is taught for \"hire\" (vv. 11, 12,\r\n16; cf. 1 Tim. vi. 5). The unworthy \"shepherds\" (v. 12; cf. Ezek. xxxiv.\r\n8; John x. 12 seq.) live at the expense of their flocks, polluting the\r\n\"love-feasts,\" corrupting the true disciples. According to Clement of\r\nAlexandria this was written prophetically to apply to the Carpocratians,\r\nan antinomian Gnostic sect of _c._ 150; but hyper-Paulinists had given\r\noccasion to similar complaints already in Rev. ii. 14, 20 (95). Thus\r\nPaulinism and its perversion alike are in the past. As regards the\r\nundeniable contact of _Didache_ ii. 7 with Jude 22 seq. (cf. _Didache_,\r\niv. 1, Jude 8) priority cannot be determined; and the use of 1 John iii.\r\n12 in Jude 11 is doubtful.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, practically the whole of Jude is taken up into 2\r\nPet., the author merely avoiding, so far as he discovers them, the\r\nquotations from apocryphal writings, and prefixing and affixing sections\r\nof his own to refute the heretical eschatology. On the priority of Jude\r\nsee especially against Spitta _Zur Gesch. u. Litt. d. Urchristenthums_,\r\nii. 409-411, F. H. Chase, _loc. cit._ p. 803. (On 2 Pet. see PETER\r\nEPISTLES OF.) Unfortunately, the date of 2 Pet. cannot be determined as\r\nearlier than late in the second century, so that we are thrown back upon\r\ninternal evidence for the inferior limit.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of the heresy as the anti-Christ who precedes \"the last\r\nhour\" (v. 18), reminds us of 1 John ii. 18, but it is indicative of\r\nconditions somewhat less advanced that the heretics have not yet \"gone\r\nout from\" the church. The treatment of the apostolic age as past, and\r\nthe deposit of the faith as a _regula fidei_ (cf. Ign. _ad Trall._ ix.),\r\nthe presence of antinomian Gnosticism, denying the doctrine of lordship\r\nand \"glories\" (v. 8), with \"discriminations\" between \"psychic\" and\r\n\"pneumatic\" (v. 19), strongly oppose a date earlier than 100.\r\n\r\nSieffert, on account of the superscription, would date as early as\r\n70-80, but acknowledges the hyper-Pauline affinity of the heresy, its\r\npropagation as a doctrine, and close relation to the Nicolaitan of Rev.\r\nii. 14. To these phenomena he gives accordingly a correspondingly early\r\ndate. The nature of the heresy, opposed, however, and the resort to the\r\nauthority of Jude \"the brother of James\" against it, favour rather the\r\nperiod of Polycarp and Papias (117-150).\r\n\r\nThe history of the reception of the epistle into church canons is\r\nsimilar to that of James, beginning with a quotation of it as the work\r\nof Jude by Clement of Alexandria (_Paed._ iii. 8), a reference by\r\nTertullian (_De cult. fem._ i. 3), and a more or less hesitant\r\nendorsement by Origen (\"if one might adduce the epistle of Jude,\" _In\r\nMatt._ tom. xvii. 30) and by the _Muratorianum_ (_c._ 200), which\r\nexcepts Jude and 2 and 3 John from its condemnation of apocryphal\r\nliterature, placing it on a par with the Wisdom of Solomon \"which was\r\nwritten by friends of his in his honour.\" The use of apocryphal\r\nliterature in Jude itself may account for much of the critical\r\ndisposition toward it of many subsequent writers. Eusebius classed it\r\namong the \"disputed\" books, declaring that as with James \"not many of\r\nthe ancients have mentioned it\" (_H. E._ ii. 23, 25).\r\n\r\n  The _Introd. to the New Test._ by Holtzmann, Jülicher, Weiss, Zahn,\r\n  Davidson, Salmon, Bacon and the standard _Commentaries_ of Meyer and\r\n  Holtzmann, the _International_ (Bigg) and other series, contain\r\n  discussions of authorship and date. The articles s.v. in Hastings's\r\n  _Dict. Bible_ (Chase) and the _Ency. Bib._ (Cone) are full and\r\n  scholarly. In addition the _Histories of the Apostolic Age_, by\r\n  Hausrath, Weizsäcker, McGiffert, Bartlet, Ropes and others, and the\r\n  kindred works of Baur, Schwegler and Pfleiderer should be consulted.\r\n  Moffat's _Historical New Testament_, 2nd ed., p. 589, contains a\r\n  convenient summary of the evidence with copious bibliography. One of\r\n  the most thorough of conservative treatments is the _Commentary on\r\n  Jude and Second Peter_ by J. B. Mayor (1907).     (B. W. B.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] On this point (date of the outbreak of heresy) there is some\r\n    inconsistency in the reported fragments of Hegesippus. In that quoted\r\n    below from Eus. _H. E._ iii. 32. 7 seq., it is expressly dated after\r\n    the martyrdom of Symeon and death of the grandsons of Jude under\r\n    Trajan. In iii. 19 the \"ancient tradition\" attributing the\r\n    denunciation of these to \"some of the heretics\" is perhaps not from\r\n    Hegesippus; but in iv. 22 the beginning of heresy is traced to a\r\n    certain Thebuthis, a candidate for the bishopric after the death of\r\n    James, as rival to Symeon. The same figure of the church as a pure\r\n    virgin is also used as in iii. 32. But as it is only the envious\r\n    feeling of Thebuthis which is traced to this early date, Hegesippus\r\n    doubtless means to place the outbreak later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUDGE (Lat. _judex_, Fr. _juge_), in the widest legal sense an officer\r\nappointed by the sovereign power in a state to administer the law; in\r\nEnglish practice, however, justices of the peace and magistrates are not\r\nusually regarded as \"judges\" in the titular sense. The duties of the\r\njudge, whether in a civil or a criminal matter, are to hear the\r\nstatements on both sides in open court, to arrive at a conclusion as to\r\nthe truth of the facts submitted to him or, when a jury is engaged, to\r\ndirect the jury to find such a conclusion, to apply to the facts so\r\nfound the appropriate rules of law, and to certify by his judgment the\r\nrelief to which the parties are entitled or the obligations or penalties\r\nwhich they have incurred. With the judgment the office of the judge is\r\nat an end, but the judgment sets in motion the executive forces of the\r\nstate, whose duty it is to carry it into execution.\r\n\r\nSuch is the type of a judicial officer recognized by mature systems of\r\nlaw, but it is not to be accepted as the universal type, and the\r\nfollowing qualifying circumstances should be noticed: (1) in primitive\r\nsystems of law the judicial is not separated from the legislative and\r\nother governing functions; (2) although the judge is assumed to take the\r\nlaw from the legislative authority, yet, as the existing law never at\r\nany time contains provision for all cases, the judge may be obliged to\r\ninvent or create principles applicable to the case--this is called by\r\nBentham and the English jurists judge-made and judiciary law; (3) the\r\nseparation of the function of judge and jury, and the exclusive charge\r\nof questions of law given to the judge, are more particularly\r\ncharacteristic of the English judicial system. During a considerable\r\nperiod in the history of Roman law an entirely different distribution of\r\nparts was observed. The adjudication of a case was divided between the\r\n_magistratus_ and the _judex_, neither of whom corresponds to the\r\nEnglish judge. The former was a public officer charged with the\r\nexecution of the law; the latter was an arbitrator whom the magistrates\r\ncommissioned to hear and report upon a particular case.\r\n\r\nThe following are points more specially characteristic of the English\r\nsystem and its kindred judicial systems: (1) Judges are absolutely\r\nprotected from action for anything that they may do in the discharge of\r\ntheir judicial duties. This is true in the fullest sense of judges of\r\nthe supreme courts. \"It is a principle of English law that no action\r\nwill lie against a judge of one of the superior courts for a judicial\r\nact, though it be alleged to have been done maliciously and corruptly.\"\r\nOther judicial officers are also protected, though not to the same\r\nextent, against actions. (2) The highest class of judges are irremovable\r\nexcept by what is in effect a special act of parliament, viz. a\r\nresolution passed by both houses and assented to by the sovereign. The\r\ninferior judges and magistrates are removable for misconduct by the lord\r\nchancellor. (3) The judiciary in England is not a separate profession.\r\nThe judges are chosen from the class of advocates, and almost entirely\r\naccording to their eminence at the bar. (4) Judges are in England\r\nappointed for the most part by the crown. In a few cases municipal\r\ncorporations may appoint their own judicial officer.\r\n\r\n  See also LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR; LORD CHIEF JUSTICE; MASTER OF THE\r\n  ROLLS, &c., &c., and the accounts of judicial systems under country\r\n  headings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUDGE-ADVOCATE-GENERAL, an officer appointed in England to assist the\r\nCrown with advice in matters relating to military law, and more\r\nparticularly as to courts-martial. In the army the administration of\r\njustice as pertaining to discipline is carried out in accordance with\r\nthe provisions of military law, and it is the function of the\r\njudge-advocate-general to ensure that these disciplinary powers are\r\nexercised in strict conformity with that law. Down to 1793 the\r\njudge-advocate-general acted as secretary and legal adviser to the board\r\nof general officers, but on the reconstitution of the office of\r\ncommander-in-chief in that year he ceased to perform secretarial duties,\r\nbut remained chief legal adviser. He retained his seat in parliament and\r\nin 1806 he was made a member of the government and a privy councillor.\r\nThe office ceased to be political in 1892, on the recommendation of the\r\nselect committee of 1888 on army estimates, and was conferred on Sir F.\r\nJeune (afterwards Lord St Helier). There was no salary attached to the\r\noffice when held by Lord St Helier, and the duties were for the most\r\npart performed by deputy. On his death in 1905, Thomas Milvain, K.C.,\r\nwas appointed, and the terms and conditions of the post were rearranged\r\nas follows: (1) A salary of £2000 a year; (2) the holder to devote his\r\nwhole time to the duties of the post; (3) the retention of the post\r\nuntil the age of seventy, subject to continued efficiency--but with\r\nclaim to gratuity or pension on retirement. The holder was to be\r\nsubordinate to the secretary of state for war, without direct access to\r\nthe sovereign. The appointment is conferred by letters-patent, which\r\ndefine the exact functions attaching to the office, which practically\r\nare the reviewing of the proceedings of all field-general, general and\r\ndistrict courts-martial held in the United Kingdom, and advising the\r\nsovereign as to the confirmation of the finding and sentence. The deputy\r\njudge-advocate is a salaried official in the department of the\r\njudge-advocate-general and acts under his letters-patent. A separate\r\njudge-advocate-general's department is maintained in India, where at one\r\ntime deputy judge-advocates were attached to every important command.\r\nAll general courts-martial held in the United Kingdom are sent to the\r\njudge-advocate-general, to be by him submitted to the sovereign for\r\nconfirmation; and all district courts-martial, after having been\r\nconfirmed and promulgated, are sent to his office for examination and\r\ncustody. The judge-advocate-general and his deputy, being judges in the\r\nlast resort of the validity of the proceedings of courts-martial, take\r\nno part in their conduct; but the deputy judge-advocates frame and\r\nrevise charges and attend at courts-martial, swear the court, advise\r\nboth sides on law, look after the interests of the prisoner and record\r\nthe proceedings. In the English navy there is an official whose\r\nfunctions are somewhat similar to those of the judge-advocate-general.\r\nHe is called counsel and judge-advocate of the fleet.\r\n\r\nIn the United States there is also a judge-advocate-general's\r\ndepartment. In addition to being a bureau of military justice, and\r\nkeeping the records of courts-martial, courts of inquiry and military\r\ncommissions, it has the custody of all papers relating to the title of\r\nlands under the control of the war department. The officers of the\r\ndepartment, in addition to acting as prosecutors in all military trials,\r\nsometimes represent the government when cases affecting the army come up\r\nin civil courts.\r\n\r\n  See further MILITARY LAW, and consult C. M. Clode, _Administration of\r\n  Justice under Military and Martial Law_ (1872); _Military Forces of\r\n  the Crown_ (2 vols., 1869).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUDGES, THE BOOK OF, in the Bible. This book of the Old Testament,\r\nwhich, as we now read it, constitutes a sequel to the book of Joshua,\r\ncovering the period of history between the death of this conqueror and\r\nthe birth of Samuel, is so called because it contains the history of the\r\nIsraelites before the establishment of the monarchy, when the government\r\nwas in the hands of certain leaders who appear to have formed a\r\ncontinuous succession, although the office was not hereditary. The only\r\nother biblical source ascribed to this period is Ruth, whose present\r\nposition as an appendix to Judges is not original (see BIBLE and RUTH).\r\n\r\n_Structure._--It is now generally agreed that the present adjustment of\r\nthe older historical books of the Old Testament to form a continuous\r\nrecord of events from the creation to the Babylonian exile is due to an\r\neditor, or rather to successive redactors, who pieced together and\r\nreduced to a certain unity older memoirs of very different dates; and\r\ncloser examination shows that the continuity of many parts of the\r\nnarrative is more apparent than real. This is very clearly the case in\r\nthe book of Judges. It consists of three main portions: (1) an\r\nintroduction, presenting one view of the occupation of Palestine by the\r\nIsraelites (i. 1-ii. 5); (2) the history of the several judges (ii.\r\n6-xvi.); and (3) an appendix containing two narratives of the period.\r\n\r\n1. The first section relates events which are said to have taken place\r\nafter the death of Joshua, but in reality it covers the same ground with\r\nthe book of Joshua, giving a brief account of the occupation of Canaan,\r\nwhich in some particulars repeats the statements of the previous book,\r\nwhile in others it is quite independent (see JOSHUA). It is impossible\r\nto regard the warlike expeditions described in this section as\r\nsupplementary campaigns undertaken after Joshua's death; they are\r\nplainly represented as the first efforts of the Israelites to gain a\r\nfirm footing in the land (at Hebron, Debir, Bethel), in the very cities\r\nwhich Joshua is related to have subdued (Josh. x. 39).[1] Here then we\r\nhave an account of the settlement of Israel west of the Jordan which is\r\nparallel to the book of Joshua, but makes no mention of Joshua himself,\r\nand places the tribe of Judah in the front. The author of the chapter\r\ncannot have had Joshua or his history in his eye at all, and the words\r\n\"and it came to pass after the death of Joshua\" in Judg. i. 1 are from\r\nthe hand of the last editor, who desired to make the whole book of\r\nJudges, including ch. i., read continuously with that which now precedes\r\nit in the canon of the earlier prophets.[2]\r\n\r\n2. The second and main section (ii. 6-xvi.) stands on quite another\r\nfooting. According to Josh. xxiv. 31 the people \"served Yahweh\" during\r\nthe lifetime of the great conqueror and his contemporaries. In Judg. ii.\r\n7 this statement is repeated, and the writer proceeds to explain that\r\nsubsequent generations fell away from the faith, and served the gods of\r\nthe nations among which they dwelt (ii. 6-iii. 6). The worship of other\r\ngods is represented, not as something which went on side by side with\r\nYahweh-worship (cf. x. 6), but as a revolt against Yahweh, periodically\r\nrepeated and regularly chastised by foreign invasion. The history,\r\ntherefore, falls into recurring cycles, each of which begins with\r\nreligious corruption, followed by chastisement, which continues until\r\nYahweh, in answer to the groans of his oppressed people, raises up a\r\n\"judge\" to deliver Israel, and recall them to the true faith. On the\r\ndeath of the \"judge,\" if not sooner, the corruption spreads anew and the\r\nsame vicissitudes follow. This religious explanation of the course of\r\nthe history, formally expounded at the outset and repeated in more or\r\nless detail from chapter to chapter (especially vi. 1-10, x. 6-18),\r\ndetermines the form of the whole narrative. It is in general agreement\r\nwith the spirit as also with the language of Deuteronomy, and on this\r\naccount this section may be conveniently called \"the Deuteronomic Book\r\nof Judges.\" But the main religious ideas are not so late and are rather\r\nakin to those of Josh. xxiv; in particular the worship of the high\r\nplaces is not condemned, nor is it excused as in 1 Kings iii. 2. The\r\nsources of the narrative are obviously older than the theological\r\nexposition of its lessons, and herein lies the value and interest of\r\nJudges. The importance of such documents for the scientific historian\r\nlies not so much in the events they record as in the unconscious witness\r\nthey bear to the state of society in which the narrator or poet lived.\r\nFrom this point of view the parts of the book are by no means all of\r\nequal value; critical analysis shows that often parallel or distinct\r\nnarratives have been fused together, and that, whilst the older stories\r\ngave more prominence to ordinary human motives and combinations, the\r\nlater are coloured by religious reflection and show the characteristic\r\ntendency of the Old Testament to re-tell the fortunes of Israel in a\r\nform that lays ever-increasing weight on the work of Yahweh for his\r\npeople. That the pre-Deuteronomic sources are to be identified with the\r\nJudaean (J, or Yahwist) and Ephraimite (E, or Elohist) strands of the\r\nHexateuch is, however, not certain.\r\n\r\nTo the unity of religious pragmatism in the main stock of the book of\r\nJudges corresponds a unity of chronological scheme. The \"judges,\" in\r\nspite of the fact that most of them had clearly no more than a local\r\ninfluence, are all represented as successive rulers in Israel, and the\r\nhistory is dated by the years of each judgeship and those of the\r\nintervening periods of oppression. But it is impossible to reconcile the\r\nnumbers with the statement elsewhere that the fourth year of Solomon was\r\nthe 480th from the exodus (1 Kings vi. 1). See BIBLE: _Chronology_.\r\n\r\n  The general introduction (ii. 6-iii. 6) is a blend of Deuteronomic and\r\n  other sources. The intimate relation between it and the separate\r\n  narratives (Josh. xxiv. 1-27, a late [Ephraimite] record inserted by a\r\n  second Deuteronomic hand, and xxiii., D) appears both from their\r\n  contents and from the fact that Judg. ii. 6-10 is almost identical\r\n  with the narrative appended to Joshua's address (Joshua xxiv. 28-31).\r\n  Judg. i.-ii. 5, however, is not touched by D, and hence was probably\r\n  inserted in its present position at a later date. According to the\r\n  highly intricate introduction the Hebrews were oppressed: (a) to\r\n  familiarize them with warfare--it is assumed that they had\r\n  intermarried with the Canaanites and worshipped their gods (iii. 2,\r\n  6); (b) to test their loyalty to Yahweh (ii. 22; iii. 1); or (c) to\r\n  punish them for their marriage with the heathen and their apostasy (D\r\n  in ii. 12; cf. Josh. xxiii., and ibid. v. 12).\r\n\r\n  To this succeeds a noteworthy example of the Deuteronomic treatment of\r\n  tradition in the achievement of Othniel (q.v.) the only Judaean\r\n  \"judge.\" The bareness of detail, not to speak of the improbability of\r\n  the situation, renders its genuineness doubtful, and the passage is\r\n  one of the indications of a secondary Deuteronomic redaction. The\r\n  case, however, is exceptional; the stories of the other great \"judges\"\r\n  were not rewritten or to any great extent revised by the Deuteronomic\r\n  redactor, and his hand appears chiefly in the framework.[3] Thus, in\r\n  the story of Ehud and the defeat of Moab only iii. 12-15, 29-30 are\r\n  Deuteronomic. But the rest is not homogeneous, vv. 19 and 20 appear to\r\n  be variants, and the mention of Israel (v. 27b) is characteristic of\r\n  the tendency to treat local troubles as national oppressions, whereas\r\n  other records represent little national unity at this period (i., v.).\r\n  See further EHUD.\r\n\r\n  According to the Septuagint addition to Josh. xxiv. 33, Moab was the\r\n  first of Israel's oppressors. The brief notice of Shamgar, who\r\n  delivered Israel from the Philistines (iii. 31), is one of the later\r\n  insertions, and in some MSS. of the LXX. it stands after xvi. 31. The\r\n  story of the defeat of Sisera appears in two distinct forms, an\r\n  earlier, in poetical form (v.), and a later, in prose (iv.). D's\r\n  framework is to be recognized in iv. 1-4, 23 seq., v. 1 (probably), 31\r\n  (last clause); see further DEBORAH. The Midianite oppression\r\n  (vi.-viii.) is contained in the usual frame (vi. 1-6; viii. 27 seq.),\r\n  but is not homogeneous, since viii. 4, the pursuit of the kings,\r\n  cannot be the sequel of viii. 3 (where they have been slain), and\r\n  viii. 33-35 ignores ix. The structure of vi. 1-viii. 3 is particularly\r\n  intricate: vi. 25-32 does not continue vi. 11-24 (there are two\r\n  accounts of Gideon's introduction and divergent representations of\r\n  Yahweh-worship); vi. 34 forms the sequel of the latter, and vi. 36-40\r\n  (with \"God\") is strange after the description of the miracle in vv. 21\r\n  seq. (with \"Yahweh\"). Further, there are difficulties in vi. 34, vii.\r\n  23 seq., viii. 1, when compared with vii. 2-8, and in vii. 16-22 two\r\n  stratagems are combined. There are two sequels: vii. 23 seq. and viii.\r\n  4; with the former contrast vi. 35; with viii. 1-3 cf. xii. 1-6, and\r\n  see below. Chapter viii. 22 seq. comes unexpectedly, and the refusal\r\n  of the offer of the kingship reflects later ideas (cf. 1 Sam. viii. 7;\r\n  x. 19; xii. 12, 17). The conclusion, however, shows that Jerubbaal had\r\n  only a local reputation. Finally, the condemnation of the ephod as\r\n  part of the worship of Yahweh (viii. 27) agrees with the thought in\r\n  vi. 25-32 as against that in vi. 11-24. (See EPHOD; GIDEON.) Chapter\r\n  ix. (see ABIMELECH) appears to have been wanting in the Deuteronomic\r\n  book of Judges, but inserted later perhaps by means of the\r\n  introduction, viii. 30-32 (post-exilic). It has two accounts of the\r\n  attack upon Shechem (lx. 26-41 and 42-49).\r\n\r\n  After a brief notice of two \"minor judges\" (see below), follows the\r\n  story of Jephthah. It concludes with the usual Deuteronomic formula\r\n  (xii. 7), but is prefaced by a detailed introduction to the oppression\r\n  of Israel (x. 6 sqq.). By the inclusion of the Philistines among the\r\n  oppressors, and of Judah, Benjamin and Ephraim among the oppressed (x.\r\n  7, 9), it appears to have in view not merely the story of Samson, a\r\n  hero of local interest, but the early chapters in 1 Samuel. This\r\n  introduction is of composite origin (as also ii. 6-21; Josh.\r\n  xxiii.-xxiv. 25), but a satisfactory analysis seems impossible. As it\r\n  stands, it has literary connexions with the late narrative in 1 Sam.\r\n  (vii. seq., xii.), and appears to form the preface to that period of\r\n  history which ended with Samuel's great victory and the institution of\r\n  the monarchy. But this belongs to a later scheme (see SAMUEL), and the\r\n  introduction in its earlier form must have been the prelude to earlier\r\n  narratives.[4] The story of Jephthah's fight with Ammon is linked to\r\n  the preceding introduction by x. 17 seq.; for the framework see x. 6\r\n  (above), xii. 7. Chapter xi. 12-28 (cf. Num. xx. seq.) is applicable\r\n  only to Moab, vv. 29 and 32 are variants, and Jephthah's home is\r\n  placed variously in Tob. (xi. 3) and Mizpeh (v. 34). In xi. 1-10 the\r\n  outlaw stipulates that he shall be chief of Gilead if successful, but\r\n  in vv. 12-28 a ruler speaks on behalf of Israel. Both Moab and Ammon\r\n  had good reason to be hostile to Gilead (Num. xxi.), but the scene of\r\n  the victory points rather to the former (v. 33, possibly conflate).\r\n  There is a general resemblance between the victories of Gideon and\r\n  Jephthah, which is emphasized by the close relation between viii. 1-3\r\n  and xii. 1-6, the explanation of which in its present context is\r\n  difficult. See further JEPHTHAH.\r\n\r\n  The old stories of Samson the Danite have been scarcely touched by the\r\n  redaction (xiii. 1; xv. 20; xvi. 31b, where he is a \"judge\"); only\r\n  xiii. appears to be rather later (v. 5 represents him as a forerunner\r\n  of Samuel and Saul), and gives a rather different impression of the\r\n  hero of the folk-tales. The cycle illustrates some interesting customs\r\n  and is in every way valuable as a specimen of popular narrative. See\r\n  SAMSON.\r\n\r\n  Grouped among these narratives are the five so-called \"minor judges\"\r\n  (x. 1-5; xii. 8-15). By the addition of Shamgar (iii. 31) the number\r\n  is made to agree with the six more important names. They are not\r\n  represented as having any immediate religious importance; they really\r\n  lie outside of the chronological scheme, and their history is plainly\r\n  not related from such lively and detailed reminiscence as gives charm\r\n  to the longer episodes of the book. The notices are drawn up in set\r\n  phraseology, and some of the names, in harmony with a characteristic\r\n  feature of early Hebrew history, are those of personified families of\r\n  communities rather than of families.[5]\r\n\r\n3. The third and last section of the book embraces chapters xvii.-xxi.,\r\nand consists of two narratives independent of one another and of the\r\nmain stock of the book, with which they are not brought into any\r\nchronological connexion. They appear to owe their position to the latest\r\nredactor (akin to the latest stratum in the Hexateuch) who has heavily\r\nworked over xix-xxi., and put the book into its present form by the\r\naddition of i.-ii. 5, ix. and possibly of v.[6]\r\n\r\n  The first narrative, that of Micah and the Danites, is of the highest\r\n  interest both as a record of the state of religion and for the picture\r\n  it gives of the way in which one clan passed from the condition of an\r\n  invading band into settled possession of land and city. Its interest\r\n  (xvii. seq.) lies in the foundation of the Ephraimite sanctuary by\r\n  Micah as also in that of Dan. There are some repetitions in the\r\n  account, but there is not enough evidence to restore two complete\r\n  stories. The history of the Levite and the Benjamites is of quite\r\n  another character, and presupposes a degree of unity of feeling and\r\n  action among the tribes of Israel which it is not easy to reconcile\r\n  with the rest of the book. In its present form this episode appears to\r\n  be not very ancient; it resembles Ruth in giving a good deal of\r\n  curious archaeological detail (the feast at Shiloh) in a form which\r\n  suggests that the usages referred to were already obsolete when the\r\n  narrative was composed. It appears to consist of an old story which\r\n  has been heavily revised to form an edifying piece of exposition. The\r\n  older parts are preserved in xix.: the account of the Levite of Mt\r\n  Ephraim whose concubine from Bethlehem in Judah was outraged, not by\r\n  the non-Israelite Jebusites of Jerusalem, but by the Benjamites of\r\n  Gibeah; there are traces of another source in vv. 6-8, 10, 13, 15. The\r\n  older portions of xx. seq. include: the vengeance taken by Israel\r\n  (e.g. xx. 3-8, 14, 19, 29, 36-41, 47), and the reconstruction of the\r\n  tribe by intermarriage with the women of Shiloh (xxi. 1, 15, 17-19,\r\n  21-23). The post-exilic expansions (found chiefly in xx., xxi. 2-14,\r\n  16, 24 seq.) describe the punishment of Benjamin by the religious\r\n  assembly and the massacre of Jabesh-Gilead for its refusal to join\r\n  Israel, four hundred virgins of the Gileadites being saved for\r\n  Benjamin. How much old tradition underlies these stories is\r\n  questionable. It is very doubtful whether Hosea's allusion to the\r\n  depravity of Gibeah (ix. 9; x. 9) is to be referred hither, but it is\r\n  noteworthy that whilst Gibeah and Jabesh-Gilead, which appear here in\r\n  a bad light, are known to be associated with Saul, the sufferer is a\r\n  Levite of Bethlehem, the traditional home of David. The account of the\r\n  great fight in xx. is reminiscent of Joshua's battle at Ai (Josh.\r\n  vii.-viii.).\r\n\r\n_Historical Value_.--The book of Judges consists of a number of\r\nnarratives collected by Deuteronomic editors; to the same circles are\r\ndue accounts of the invasions of Palestine and settlement in Joshua, and\r\nof the foundation of the monarchy in 1 Samuel. The connexion has been\r\nbroken by the later insertion of matter (not necessarily of late date\r\nitself), and the whole was finally formed into a distinct book by a\r\npost-exilic hand. The dates of the older stories preserved in ii. 6-xvi.\r\n6 are quite unknown. If they are trustworthy for the period to which\r\nthey are relegated (approximately 14th-12th cent. B.C.) they are\r\npresumably of very great antiquity, but if they belong to the sources J\r\nand E of the Hexateuch (at least some four or five centuries later)\r\ntheir value is seriously weakened. On the other hand, the belief that\r\nthe monarchy had been preceded by national \"judges\" may have led to the\r\nformation of the collection. It is evident that there was more than one\r\nperiod in Israelite history in which one or other of these stories of\r\nlocal heroes would be equally suitable. They reflect tribal rivalry and\r\njealousy (cf. Isa. ix. 21, and the successors of Jeroboam 2), attacks by\r\nnomads and wars with Ammon and Moab; conflicts between newly settled\r\nIsraelites and indigenous Canaanites have been suspected in the story of\r\nAbimelech, and it is not impossible that the post-Deuteronomic writer\r\nwho inserted ch. ix. so understood the record. A striking exception to\r\nthe lack of unity among the tribes is afforded by the account of the\r\ndefeat of Sisera, and here the old poem represents a combined effort to\r\nthrow off the yoke of a foreign oppressor, while the later prose version\r\napproximates the standpoint of Josh. xi. 1-15, with its defeat of the\r\nCanaanites. The general standpoint of the stories (esp. Judg. v.) is\r\nthat of central Palestine; the exceptions are Othniel and Samson--the\r\nlatter interrupting the introduction in x., and its sequel, the former\r\nnow entirely due to the Deuteronomic editor. Of the narratives which\r\nprecede and follow, ch. i. represents central Palestine separated by\r\nCanaanite cities from tribes to the south and north; it is the situation\r\nrecognized in Judg. xix. 10-12, as well as in passages imbedded in the\r\nlatest portions of the book of Joshua, though it is in contradiction to\r\nthe older traditions of Joshua himself. Chapters xvii. seq. (like the\r\npreceding story of Samson) deal with Danites, but the migration can\r\nhardly be earlier than David's time; and xix.-xxi., by describing the\r\nextermination of Benjamin, form a link between the presence of the tribe\r\nin the late narratives of the exodus and its new prominence in the\r\ntraditions of Saul (q.v.). As an historical source, therefore, the value\r\nof Judges will depend largely upon the question whether the Deuteronomic\r\neditor (about 600 B.C. at the earliest) would have access to trustworthy\r\ndocuments relating to a period some six or seven centuries previously.\r\nSee further JEWS, §§ 6, 8; and SAMUEL, BOOKS OF.\r\n\r\n  LITERATURE.--Biblical scholars are in agreement regarding the\r\n  preliminary literary questions of the book, but there is divergence of\r\n  opinion on points of detail, and on the precise growth of the book\r\n  (e.g. the twofold Deuteronomic redaction). See further W. R. Smith,\r\n  _Ency. Brit._ 9th ed. (upon which the present article is based); G. F.\r\n  Moore, _International Critical Comm._ (1895); _Ency. Bib._, art.\r\n  \"Judges\"; K.

C.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] This is confirmed by the circumstance that in Judg. ii. 1 the\r\n    \"angel of Yahweh,\" who, according to Exod. xiv. 24, xxiii. 20, xxxii.\r\n    34, xxxiii. 2, 7 seq., must be viewed as having his local\r\n    manifestation at the headquarters of the host of Israel, is still\r\n    found at Gilgal and not at Shiloh.\r\n\r\n  [2] The chapter was written after Israel had become strong enough to\r\n    make the Canaanite cities tributary (v. 28), that is, after the\r\n    establishment of the monarchy (see 1 Kings ix. 20-21).\r\n\r\n  [3] Hence, it is to be inferred that the reviser had older _written_\r\n    records before him. Had these been in the oral stage he would\r\n    scarcely incorporate traditions which did not agree with his views;\r\n    at all events they would hardly have been written down by him in the\r\n    form in which they have survived. The narratives of the monarchy\r\n    which are preserved only in Chronicles, on the other hand, illustrate\r\n    the manner in which tradition was reshaped and rewritten under the\r\n    influence of a later religious standpoint.\r\n\r\n  [4] It may be conjectured that the introduction originally formed the\r\n    prelude to the rise of Saul: the intervening narratives, though not\r\n    necessarily of late origin themselves, having been subsequently\r\n    inserted. See S. A. Cook, _Crit. Notes O. T.

See GENEALOGY: _Biblical_.\r\n\r\n  [6] To the same post-exilic hand may also be ascribed the\r\n    introduction of the \"minor judges\" (so several critics), and smaller\r\n    additions here and there (ch. i. 1 opening words, vv. 4, 8 seq.\r\n    [contrast 21] 18; viii. 30-32: xi. 2, &c.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUDGMENT, in law, a term used to describe (1) the adjudication by a\r\ncourt of justice upon a controversy submitted to it _inter partes_\r\n(_post litem contestatam_) and determining the rights of the parties and\r\nthe relief to be awarded by the court as between them; (2) the formal\r\ndocument issuing from the court in which that adjudication is\r\nexpressed; (3) the opinions of the judges expressed in a review of the\r\nfacts and law applicable to the controversy leading up to the\r\nadjudication expressed in the formal document. When the judgment has\r\nbeen passed and entered and recorded it binds the parties: the\r\ncontroversy comes to an end (_transit in rem judicatam_), and the person\r\nin whose favour the judgment is entered is entitled to enforce it by the\r\nappropriate method of \"execution.\" There has been much controversy among\r\nlawyers as to the meaning of the expressions \"final\" and \"interlocutory\"\r\nas applied to judgments, and as to the distinction between a \"judgment,\"\r\na \"decree,\" and an \"order.\" These disputes arise upon the wording of\r\nstatutes or rules of court and with reference to the appropriate times\r\nor modes of appeal or of execution.\r\n\r\nThe judgments of one country are not as a rule directly enforceable in\r\nanother country. In Europe, by treaty or arrangement, foreign judgments\r\nare in certain cases and on compliance with certain formalities made\r\nexecutory in various states. A similar provision is made as between\r\nEngland, Scotland and Ireland, for the registry and execution in each\r\ncountry of certain classes of judgments given in the others. But as\r\nregards the rest of the king's dominions and foreign states, a \"foreign\"\r\njudgment is in England recognized only as constituting a cause of action\r\nwhich may be sued upon in England. If given by a court of competent\r\njurisdiction it is treated as creating a legal obligation to pay the sum\r\nadjudged to be due. Summary judgment may be entered in an English action\r\nbased on a foreign judgment unless the defendant can show that the\r\nforeign court had not jurisdiction over the parties or the subject\r\nmatter of the action, or that there was fraud on the part of the foreign\r\ncourt or the successful party, or that the foreign proceedings were\r\ncontrary to natural justice, e.g. concluded without due notice to the\r\nparties affected. English courts will not enforce foreign judgments as\r\nto foreign criminal or penal or revenue laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUDGMENT DEBTOR, in English law, a person against whom a judgment\r\nordering him to pay a sum of money has been obtained and remains\r\nunsatisfied. Such a person may be examined as to whether any and what\r\ndebts are owing to him, and if the judgment debt is of the necessary\r\namount he may be made bankrupt if he fails to comply with a bankruptcy\r\nnotice served on him by the judgment creditors, or he may be committed\r\nto prison or have a receiving order made against him in a judgment\r\nsummons under the Debtors Act 1869.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUDGMENT SUMMONS, in English law, a summons issued under the Debtors Act\r\n1869, on the application of a creditor who has obtained a judgment for\r\nthe payment of a sum of money by instalments or otherwise, where the\r\norder for payment has not been complied with. The judgment summons cites\r\nthe defendant to appear personally in court, and be examined on oath as\r\nto the means he has, or has had, since the date of the order or judgment\r\nmade against him, to pay the same, and to show cause why he should not\r\nbe committed to prison for his default. An order of commitment obtained\r\nin a judgment summons remains in force for a year only, and the extreme\r\nterm of imprisonment is six weeks, dating from the time of lodging in\r\nprison. When a debtor has once been imprisoned, although for a period of\r\nless than six weeks, no second order of commitment can be made against\r\nhim in respect of the same debt. But if the judgment be for payment by\r\ninstalments a power of committal arises on default of payment for each\r\ninstalment. If an order of commitment has never been executed, or\r\nbecomes inoperative through lapse of time, a fresh commitment may be\r\nmade. Imprisonment does not operate as a satisfaction or extinguishment\r\nof a debt, or deprive a person of a right of execution against the land\r\nor goods of the person imprisoned in the same manner as if there had\r\nbeen no imprisonment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUDICATURE ACTS, an important series of English statutes having for\r\ntheir object the simplification of the system of judicature in its\r\nhigher branches. They are the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 (36 &\r\n37 Vict. c. 66) and the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1875 (38 & 39\r\nVict. c. 77), with various amending acts, the twelfth of these being in\r\n1899. By the act of 1873 the court of chancery, the court of queen's\r\n(king's) bench, the court of common pleas, the court of exchequer, the\r\nhigh court of admiralty, the court of probate and the court of divorce\r\nand matrimonial causes were consolidated into one Supreme[1] Court of\r\nJudicature (sec. 3), divided into two permanent divisions, called \"the\r\nhigh court,\" with (speaking broadly) original jurisdiction, and \"the\r\ncourt of appeal\" (sec. 4). The objects of the act were threefold--first,\r\nto reduce the historically independent courts of common law and equity\r\ninto one supreme court; secondly, to establish for all divisions of the\r\ncourt a uniform system of pleading and procedure; and thirdly, to\r\nprovide for the enforcement of the same rule of law in those cases where\r\nchancery and common law recognized different rules. It can be seen at\r\nonce how bold and revolutionary was this new enactment. By one section\r\nthe august king's bench, the common pleas, in which serjeants only had\r\nformerly the right of audience, and the exchequer, which had its origin\r\nin the reign of Henry I., and all their jurisdiction, criminal, legal\r\nand equitable, were vested in the new court. It must be understood,\r\nhowever, that law and equity were not fused in the sense in which that\r\nphrase has generally been employed. The chancery division still remains\r\ndistinct from the common law division, having a certain range of legal\r\nquestions under its exclusive control, and possessing to a certain\r\nextent a peculiar machinery of its own for carrying its decrees into\r\nexecution. But all actions may now be brought in the high court of\r\njustice, and, subject to such special assignments of business as that\r\nalluded to, may be tried in any division thereof.\r\n\r\nThere were originally three common law divisions of the High Court\r\ncorresponding with the three former courts of common law. But after the\r\ndeath of Lord Chief Baron Kelly on the 17th of September 1880, and of\r\nLord Chief Justice Cockburn on the 20th of November 1880, the common\r\npleas and exchequer divisions were (by order in council, 10th December\r\n1880) consolidated with the king's bench division into one division\r\nunder the presidency of the lord chief justice of England, to whom, by\r\nthe 25th section of the Judicature Act 1881, all the statutory\r\njurisdiction of the chief baron and the chief justice of the common\r\npleas was transferred. The high court, therefore, now consists of the\r\nchancery division, the common law division, under the name of the king's\r\nbench division; and the probate, divorce and admiralty division. To the\r\nking's bench division is also attached, by order of the lord chancellor\r\n(Jan. 1, 1884), the business of the London court of bankruptcy.\r\n\r\n  For a more detailed account of the composition of the various courts,\r\n  see CHANCERY; KING'S BENCH; and PROBATE, DIVORCE AND ADMIRALTY COURT.\r\n\r\nThe keystone of the structure created by the Judicature Acts was a\r\nstrong court of appeal. The House of Lords remained the last court of\r\nappeal, as before the acts, but its judicial functions were virtually\r\ntransferred to an appeal committee, consisting of the lord chancellor\r\nand other peers who have held high judicial office, and certain lords of\r\nappeal in ordinary created by the act of 1873 (see APPEAL).\r\n\r\n  The practice and procedure of the Supreme Court are regulated by rules\r\n  made by a committee of judges, to which have been added the president\r\n  of the incorporated law society and a practising barrister and one\r\n  other person nominated by the lord chancellor. The rules now in force\r\n  are those of 1883, with some subsequent amendments. With the\r\n  appendices they fill a moderate-sized volume. Complaints are made that\r\n  they go into too much detail, and place a burden on the time and\r\n  temper of the busy practitioner which he can ill afford to bear. It is\r\n  possible that the authors of the rules attempted too much, and it\r\n  might have been better to provide a simpler and more elastic code of\r\n  procedure. Rules have sometimes been made to meet individual cases of\r\n  hardship, and rules of procedure have been piled up from time to time,\r\n  sometimes embodying a new experiment, and not always consistent with\r\n  former rules.\r\n\r\n  The most important matter dealt with by the rules is the mode of\r\n  pleading. The authors of the Judicature Act had before them two\r\n  systems of pleading, both of which were open to criticism. The common\r\n  law pleadings (it was said) did not state the facts on which the\r\n  pleader relied, but only the legal aspect of the facts or the\r\n  inferences from them, while the chancery pleadings were lengthy,\r\n  tedious and to a large extent irrelevant and useless. There was some\r\n  exaggeration in both statements. In pursuing the fusion of law and\r\n  equity which was the dominant legal idea of law reformers of that\r\n  period, the framers of the first set of rules devised a system which\r\n  they thought would meet the defects of both systems, and be\r\n  appropriate for both the common-law and the chancery divisions. In a\r\n  normal case, the plaintiff delivered his statement of claim, in which\r\n  he was to set forth concisely the facts on which he relied, and the\r\n  relief which he asked. The defendant then delivered his statement of\r\n  defence, in which he was to say whether he admitted or denied the\r\n  plaintiff's facts (every averment not traversed being taken to be\r\n  admitted), and any additional facts and legal defences on which he\r\n  relied. The plaintiff might then reply, and the defendant rejoin, and\r\n  so on until the pleaders had exhausted themselves. This system of\r\n  pleading was not a bad one if accompanied by the right of either party\r\n  to demur to his opponent's pleading, i.e. to say, \"admitting all your\r\n  averments of fact to be true, you still have no cause of action,\" or\r\n  \"defence\" (as the case may be). It may be, however, that the authors\r\n  of the new system were too intent on uniformity when they abolished\r\n  the common-law pleading, which, shorn of its abuses (as it had been by\r\n  the Common Law Procedure Acts), was an admirable instrument for\r\n  defining the issue between the parties though unsuited for the more\r\n  complicated cases which are tried in chancery, and it might possibly\r\n  have been better to try the new system in the first instance in the\r\n  chancery division only. It should be added that the rules contain\r\n  provisions for actions being tried without pleadings if the defendant\r\n  does not require a statement of claim, and for the plaintiff in an\r\n  action of debt obtaining immediate judgment unless the defendant gets\r\n  leave to defend. In the chancery division there are of course no\r\n  pleadings in those matters which by the rules can be disposed of by\r\n  summons in chambers instead of by ordinary suit as formerly.\r\n\r\n  The judges seem to have been dissatisfied with the effect of their\r\n  former rules, for in 1883 they issued a fresh set of consolidated\r\n  rules, which, with subsequent amendments, are those now in force. By\r\n  these rules a further attempt was made to prune the exuberance of\r\n  pleading. Concise forms of statement of claim and defence were given\r\n  in the appendix for adoption by the pleader. It is true that these\r\n  forms do not display a high standard of excellence in draftsmanship,\r\n  and it was said that many of them were undoubtedly demurrable, but\r\n  that was not of much importance. Demurrers were abolished, and instead\r\n  thereof it was provided that any point of law raised by the pleadings\r\n  should be disposed of at or after the trial, provided that by consent\r\n  or order of the court the same might be set down and disposed of\r\n  before the trial (Order xxv. rules 1, 2). This, in the opinion of Lord\r\n  Davey in 1902 (_Ency. Brit._, 10th ed., xxx. 146), was a disastrous\r\n  change. The right of either party to challenge his opponent _in\r\n  limine_, either where the question between them was purely one of law,\r\n  or where even the view of the facts taken and alleged by his opponent\r\n  did not constitute a cause of action or defence, was a most valuable\r\n  one, and tended to the curtailment of both the delay and the expense\r\n  of litigation. Any possibility of abuse by frivolous or technical\r\n  demurrers (as undoubtedly was formerly the case) had been met by\r\n  powers of amendment and the infliction of costs. Many of the most\r\n  important questions of law had been decided on demurrer both in common\r\n  law and chancery. Lord Davey considered that demurrer was a useful and\r\n  satisfactory mode of trying questions in chancery (on bill and\r\n  demurrer), and it was frequently adopted in preference to a special\r\n  case, which requires the statement of facts to be agreed to by both\r\n  parties and was consequently more difficult and expensive. It is\r\n  obvious that a rule which makes the normal time for decision of\r\n  questions at law the trial or subsequently, and a preliminary decision\r\n  the exception, and such exception dependent on the consent of both\r\n  parties or an order of the court, is a poor substitute for a demurrer\r\n  as of right, and it has proved so in practice. The editors of the\r\n  _Yearly Practice_ for 1901 (Muir Mackenzie, Lushington and Fox) said\r\n  (p. 272): \"Points of law raised by the pleadings are usually disposed\r\n  of at the trial or on further consideration after the trial of the\r\n  issues of fact,\" that is to say, after the delay, worry and expense of\r\n  a trial of disputed questions of fact which after all may turn out to\r\n  be unnecessary. The abolition of demurrers has also (it is believed)\r\n  had a prejudicial effect on the standard of legal accuracy and\r\n  knowledge required in practitioners. Formerly the pleader had the fear\r\n  of a demurrer before him. Nowadays he need not stop to think whether\r\n  his cause of action or defence will hold water or not, and anything\r\n  which is not obviously frivolous or vexatious will do by way of\r\n  pleading for the purpose of the trial and for getting the opposite\r\n  party into the box.\r\n\r\n  Another change was made by the rules of 1883, which was regarded by\r\n  some common law lawyers as revolutionary. Formerly every issue of fact\r\n  in a common law action, including the amount of damage, had to be\r\n  decided by the verdict of a jury. \"The effect of the rules of 1883,\"\r\n  said Lord Lindley, who was a member of the rule committee, \"was to\r\n  make trial without a jury the normal mode of trial, except where trial\r\n  with a jury is ordered under rules 6 or 7a, or may be had without an\r\n  order under rule 2\" (_Timson_ v. _Wilson_, 38 Ch. D. 72, at p. 76).\r\n  The effect of the rules may be thus summarized: (1) In the chancery\r\n  division no trial by jury unless ordered by the judge. (2) Generally\r\n  the judge may order trial without a jury of any cause or issue, which\r\n  before the Judicature Act might have been so tried without consent of\r\n  parties, or which involves prolonged investigation of documents or\r\n  accounts, or scientific or local investigation. (3) Either party has a\r\n  right to a jury in actions of slander, libel, false imprisonment,\r\n  malicious prosecution, seduction or breach of promise of marriage,\r\n  upon notice without order; (4) or in any other action, by order. (5)\r\n  Subject as above, actions are to be tried without a jury unless the\r\n  judge, of his own motion, otherwise orders.\r\n\r\n  Further steps have been taken with a view to simplification of\r\n  procedure. By Order xxx. rule 1 (as amended in 1897), a summons,\r\n  called a summons for directions, has to be taken out by a plaintiff\r\n  immediately after the appearance of the defendant, and upon such\r\n  summons an order is to be made respecting pleadings, and a number of\r\n  interlocutory proceedings. To make such an order at that early stage\r\n  would seem to demand a prescience and intelligent anticipation of\r\n  future events which can hardly be expected of a master, or even a\r\n  judge in chambers, except in simple cases, involving a single issue of\r\n  law or fact which the parties are agreed in presenting to the court.\r\n  The effect of the rule is that the plaintiff cannot deliver his\r\n  statement of claim, or take any step in the action without the leave\r\n  of the judge. In chancery cases the order usually made is that the\r\n  plaintiff deliver his statement of claim, and the rest of the summons\r\n  stand over, and the practical effect is merely to add a few pounds to\r\n  the costs. It may be doubted whether, as applied to the majority of\r\n  actions, the rule does not proceed on wrong lines, and whether it\r\n  would not be better to leave the parties, who know the exigencies of\r\n  their case better even than a judge in chambers, to proceed in their\r\n  own way, subject to stringent provisions for immediate payment of the\r\n  costs occasioned by unnecessary, vexatious, or dilatory proceedings.\r\n  The order does not apply to admiralty cases or to proceedings under\r\n  the order next mentioned.\r\n\r\n  The Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Ireland) 1877 follows the same\r\n  lines as the English acts. The pre-existing courts were consolidated\r\n  into a supreme court of judicature, consisting of a high court of\r\n  justice and a court of appeal. The judicature acts did not affect\r\n  Scottish judicature, but the Appellate Jurisdiction Act included the\r\n  court of session among the courts from which an appeal lies to the\r\n  House of Lords.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] The comte de Franqueville in his interesting work, _Le Système\r\n    judiciaire de la Grande Bretagne_, criticizes the use of the word\r\n    \"supreme\" as a designation of this court, inasmuch as its judgments\r\n    are subject to appeal to the House of Lords, but in the act of 1873\r\n    the appeal to the House of Lords was abolished. He is also severe on\r\n    the illogical use of the words \"division\" and \"court\" in many\r\n    different senses (i. 180-181).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUDITH, THE BOOK OF, one of the apocryphal books of the Old Testament.\r\nIt takes its name from the heroine Judith ([Greek: Ioudith, Ioudêth],\r\ni.e. [Hebrew: yehudit], Jewess), to whom the last nine of its sixteen\r\nchapters relate. In the Septuagint and Vulgate it immediately precedes\r\nEsther, and along with Tobit comes after Nehemiah; in the English\r\nApocrypha it is placed between Tobit and the apocryphal additions to\r\nEsther.\r\n\r\n_Argument._--In the twelfth year of his reign Nebuchadrezzar, who is\r\ndescribed as king of Assyria, having his capital in Nineveh, makes war\r\nagainst Arphaxad, king of Media, and overcomes him in his seventeenth\r\nyear. He then despatches his chief general Holofernes to take vengeance\r\non the nations of the west who had withheld their assistance. This\r\nexpedition has already succeeded in its main objects when Holofernes\r\nproceeds to attack Judaea. The children of Israel, who are described as\r\nhaving newly returned from captivity, are apprehensive of a desecration\r\nof their sanctuary, and resolve on resistance to the uttermost. The\r\ninhabitants of Bethulia (Betylua) and Betomestham in particular (neither\r\nplace can be identified), directed by Joachim the high priest, guard the\r\nmountain passes near Dothaim, and place themselves under God's\r\nprotection. Holofernes now inquires of the chiefs who are with him about\r\nthe Israelites, and is answered by Achior the leader of the Ammonites,\r\nwho enters upon a long historical narrative showing the Israelites to be\r\ninvincible except when they have offended God. For this Achior is\r\npunished by being handed over to the Israelites, who lead him to the\r\ngovernor of Bethulia. Next day the siege begins, and after forty days\r\nthe famished inhabitants urge the governor Ozias to surrender, which he\r\nconsents to do unless relieved in five days. Judith, a beautiful and\r\npious widow of the tribe of Simeon, now appears on the scene with a plan\r\nof deliverance. Wearing her rich attire, and accompanied by her maid,\r\nwho carries a bag of provisions, she goes over to the hostile camp,\r\nwhere she is at once conducted to the general, whose suspicions are\r\ndisarmed by the tales she invents. After four days Holofernes, smitten\r\nwith her charms, at the close of a sumptuous entertainment invites her\r\nto remain within his tent over night. No sooner is he overcome with\r\nsleep than Judith, seizing his sword, strikes off his head and gives it\r\nto her maid; both now leave the camp (as they had previously been\r\naccustomed to do, ostensibly for prayer) and return to Bethulia, where\r\nthe trophy is displayed amid great rejoicings and thanksgivings. Achior\r\nnow publicly professes Judaism, and at the instance of Judith the\r\nIsraelites make a sudden victorious onslaught on the enemy. Judith now\r\nsings a song of praise, and all go up to Jerusalem to worship with\r\nsacrifice and rejoicing. The book concludes with a brief notice of the\r\nclosing years of the heroine.\r\n\r\n  _Versions._--Judith was written originally in Hebrew. This is shown\r\n  not only by the numerous Hebraisms, but also by mistranslations of the\r\n  Greek translation, as in ii. 2, iii. 9, and other passages (see\r\n  Fritzsche and Ball _in loc._), despite the statement of Origen (_Ep.\r\n  ad Afric._ 13) that the book was not received by the Jews among their\r\n  apocryphal writings. In his preface to Judith, Jerome says that he\r\n  based his Latin version on the Chaldee, which the Jews reckoned among\r\n  their Hagiographa. Ball (_Speaker's Apocrypha_, i. 243) holds that the\r\n  Chaldee text used by Jerome was a free translation or adaptation of\r\n  the Hebrew. The book exists in two forms: the shorter, which is\r\n  preserved only in Hebrew (see under _Hebrew Midrashim_ below), is,\r\n  according to Scholz, Lipsius, Ball and Gaster, the older; the longer\r\n  form is that contained in the versions.\r\n\r\n  _Greek Version._--This is found in three recensions: (1) in A B,\r\n  [Hebrew: a]; (2) in codices 19, 108 (Lucian's text); (3) in codex 58,\r\n  the source of the old Latin and Syriac.\r\n\r\n  _Syriac and Latin Versions._--Two Syriac versions were made from the\r\n  Greek--the first, that of the Peshito; and the second, that of Paul of\r\n  Tella, the so-called Hexaplaric. The Old Latin was derived from the\r\n  Greek, as we have remarked above, and Jerome's from the Old Latin,\r\n  under the control of a Chaldee version.\r\n\r\n  _Later Hebrew Midrashim._--These are printed in Jellinek's _Bet\r\n  ha-Midrasch_, i. 130-131; ii. 12-22; and by Gaster in _Proceedings of\r\n  the Society of Biblical Archæology_ (1894), pp. 156-163.\r\n\r\n_Date._--The book in its fuller form was most probably written in the\r\n2nd century B.C. The writer places his romance two centuries earlier, in\r\nthe time of Ochus, as we may reasonably infer from the attack made by\r\nHolofernes and Bagoas on Judaea; for Artaxerxes Ochus made an expedition\r\nagainst Phoenicia and Egypt in 350 B.C., in which his chief generals\r\nwere Holofernes and Bagoas.\r\n\r\n  RECENT LITERATURE.--Ball, _Speaker's Apocrypha_ (1888), an excellent\r\n  piece of work; Scholz, _Das Buch Judith_ (1896); Löhr, _Apok. und\r\n  Pseud._ (1900), ii. 147-164; Porter in Hastings's _Dict.

C.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUDSON, ADONIRAM (1788-1850), American missionary, was born at Malden,\r\nMassachusetts, on the 9th of August 1788, the son of a Congregational\r\nminister. He graduated at Brown University in 1807, was successively a\r\nschool teacher and an actor, completed a course at the Andover\r\nTheological Seminary in September 1810, and was at once licensed to\r\npreach as a Congregational clergyman. In the summer of 1810 he with\r\nseveral of his fellows students at Andover had petitioned the general\r\nassociation of ministers to be sent to Asiatic missionary fields. This\r\napplication resulted in the establishment of the American board of\r\ncommissioners for foreign missions, which sent Judson to England to\r\nsecure, if possible, the co-operation of the London Missionary Society.\r\nHis ship fell into the hands of a French privateer and he was for some\r\ntime a prisoner in France, but finally proceeded to London, where his\r\nproposal was considered without anything being decided. He then returned\r\nto America, where he found the board ready to act independently. His\r\nappointment to Burma followed, and in 1812, accompanied by his wife, Ann\r\nHasseltine Judson (1789-1826), he went to Calcutta. On the voyage both\r\nbecame advocates of baptism by immersion, and being thus cut off from\r\nCongregationalism, they began independent work. In 1814 they began to\r\nreceive support from the American Baptist missionary union, which had\r\nbeen founded with the primary object of keeping them in the field. After\r\na few months at Madras, they settled at Rangoon. There Judson mastered\r\nBurmese, into which he translated part of the Gospels with his wife's\r\nhelp. In 1824 he removed to Ava, where during the war between the East\r\nIndia Company and Burma he was imprisoned for almost two years. After\r\npeace had been brought about (largely, it is said, through his\r\nexertions) Mrs Judson died. In 1827 Judson removed his headquarters to\r\nMaulmain, where school buildings and a church were erected, and where in\r\n1834 he married Sarah Hall Boardman (1803-1845). In 1833 he completed\r\nhis translation of the Bible; in succeeding years he compiled a Burmese\r\ngrammar, a Burmese dictionary, and a Pali dictionary. In 1845 his wife's\r\nfailing health decided Judson to return to America, but she died during\r\nthe voyage, and was buried at St Helena. In the United States Judson\r\nmarried Emily Chubbuck (1817-1854), well-known as a poet and novelist\r\nunder the name of \"Fanny Forrester,\" who was one of the earliest\r\nadvocates in America of the higher education of women. She returned with\r\nhim in 1846 to Burma, where the rest of his life was devoted largely to\r\nthe rewriting of his Burmese dictionary. He died at sea on the 12th of\r\nApril 1850, while on his way to Martinique, in search of health. Judson\r\nwas perhaps the greatest, as he was practically the first, of the many\r\nmissionaries sent from the United States into foreign fields; his\r\nfervour, his devotion to duty, and his fortitude in the face of danger\r\nmark him as the prototype of the American missionary.\r\n\r\n  The Judson Memorial, an institutional church, was erected on\r\n  Washington Square South, New York City, largely through the exertions\r\n  of his son, Rev. Edward Judson (b. 1844), who became its pastor and\r\n  director, and who prepared a life of Dr Judson (1883; new ed. 1898).\r\n  Another biography is by Francis Wayland (2 vols., 1854). See also\r\n  Robert T. Middleditch's _Life of Adoniram Judson, Burmah's Great\r\n  Missionary_ (New York, 1859). For the three Mrs. Judsons, see Knowles,\r\n  _Life of Ann Hasseltine Judson_ (1829); Emily C. Judson, _Life of\r\n  Sarah Hall Boardman Judson_ (1849); Asahel C. Kendrick, _Life and\r\n  Letters of Emily Chubbuck Judson_ (1861).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUEL, JENS (1631-1700), Danish statesman, born on the 15th of July 1631,\r\nbegan his diplomatic career in the suite of Count Christian Rantzau,\r\nwhom he accompanied to Vienna and Regensburg in 1652. In August 1657\r\nJuel was accredited to the court of Poland, and though he failed to\r\nprevent King John Casimir from negotiating separately with Sweden he was\r\nmade a privy councillor on his return home. But it was the\r\nreconciliation of Juel's uncle Hannibal Sehested with King Frederick\r\nIII. which secured Juel's future. As Sehested's representative, he\r\nconcluded the peace of Copenhagen with Charles X., and after the Danish\r\nrevolution of 1660 was appointed Danish minister at Stockholm, where he\r\nremained for eight years. Subsequently the chancellor Griffenfeldt, who\r\nhad become warmly attached to him, sent him in 1672, and again in 1674,\r\nas ambassador extraordinary to Sweden, ostensibly to bring about a\r\ncloser union between the two northern kingdoms, but really to give time\r\nto consolidate Griffenfeldt's far-reaching system of alliances. Juel\r\ncompletely sympathized with Griffenfeldt's Scandinavian policy, which\r\naimed at weakening Sweden sufficiently to re-establish something like an\r\nequilibrium between the two states. Like Griffenfeldt, Juel also feared,\r\nabove all things, a Swedo-Danish war. After the unlucky Seaman War of\r\n1675-79, Juel was one of the Danish plenipotentiaries who negotiated the\r\npeace of Lund. Even then he was for an alliance with Sweden \"till we can\r\ndo better.\" This policy he consistently followed, and was largely\r\ninstrumental in bringing about the marriage of Charles XI. with\r\nChristian V.'s daughter Ulrica Leonora. But for the death of the\r\nlike-minded Swedish statesman Johan Gyllenstjerna in June 1680, Juel's\r\n\"Scandinavian\" policy might have succeeded, to the infinite advantage of\r\nboth kingdoms. He represented Denmark at the coronation of Charles XII.\r\n(December 1697), when he concluded a new treaty of alliance with Sweden.\r\nHe died in 1700.\r\n\r\nJuel, a man of very few words and a sworn enemy of phrase-making, was\r\nperhaps the shrewdest and most cynical diplomatist of his day. His motto\r\nwas: \"We should wish for what we can get.\" Throughout life he regarded\r\nthe political situation of Denmark with absolute pessimism. She was, he\r\noften said, the cat's-paw of the Great Powers. While Griffenfeldt would\r\nhave obviated this danger by an elastic political system, adaptable to\r\nall circumstances, Juel preferred seizing whatever he could get in\r\nfavourable conjunctures. In domestic affairs Juel was an adherent of\r\nthe mercantile system, and laboured vigorously for the industrial\r\ndevelopment of Denmark and Norway. For an aristocrat of the old school\r\nhe was liberally inclined, but only favoured petty reforms, especially\r\nin agriculture, while he regarded emancipation of the serfs as quite\r\nimpracticable. Juel made no secret of his preference for absolutism, and\r\nwas one of the few patricians who accepted the title of baron. He saw\r\nsome military service during the Scanian War, distinguishing himself at\r\nthe siege of Venersborg, and by his swift decision at the critical\r\nmoment materially contributing to his brother Niels's naval victory in\r\nthe Bay of Kjöge. To his great honour he remained faithful to\r\nGriffenfeldt after his fall, enabled his daughter to marry handsomely,\r\nand did his utmost, though in vain, to obtain the ex-chancellor's\r\nrelease from his dungeon.\r\n\r\n  See Carl Frederik Bricka, _Dansk biografisk lex._, art. \"Juel\" (1887,\r\n  &c.); Adolf Ditlev Jörgensen, _P. Schumacher Griffenfeldt_\r\n  (1893-1894).     (R. N. B.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUEL, NIELS (1629-1697), Danish admiral, brother of the preceding, was\r\nborn on the 8th of May 1629, at Christiania. He served his naval\r\napprenticeship under Van Tromp and De Ruyter, taking part in all the\r\nchief engagements of the war of 1652-54 between England and Holland.\r\nDuring a long indisposition at Amsterdam in 1655-1656 he acquired a\r\nthorough knowledge of ship-building, and returned to Denmark in 1656 a\r\nthoroughly equipped seaman. He served with distinction during the\r\nSwedo-Danish wars of 1658-60 and took a prominent part in the defence of\r\nCopenhagen against Charles X. During fifteen years of peace, Juel, as\r\nadmiral of the fleet, laboured assiduously to develop and improve the\r\nDanish navy, though he bitterly resented the setting over his head in\r\n1663 of Cort Adelaar on his return from the Turkish wars. In 1661 Juel\r\nmarried Margrethe Ulfeldt. On the outbreak of the Scanian War he served\r\nat first under Adelaar, but on the death of the latter in November 1675\r\nhe was appointed to the supreme command. He then won a European\r\nreputation, and raised Danish sea-power to unprecedented eminence, by\r\nthe system of naval tactics, afterwards perfected by Nelson, which\r\nconsists in cutting off a part of the enemy's force and concentrating\r\nthe whole attack on it. He first employed this manoeuvre at the battle\r\nof Jasmund off Rügen (May 25, 1676) when he broke through the enemy's\r\nline in close column and cut off five of their ships, which, however,\r\nnightfall prevented him from pursuing. Juel's operations were\r\nconsiderably hampered at this period by the overbearing conduct of his\r\nDutch auxiliary, Philip Almonde, who falsely accused the Danish admiral\r\nof cowardice. A few days after the battle of Jasmund, Cornelius Van\r\nTromp the younger, with 17 fresh Danish and Dutch ships of the line,\r\nsuperseded Juel in the supreme command. Juel took a leading part in Van\r\nTromp's great victory off Öland (June 1, 1676), which enabled the Danes\r\nto invade Scania unopposed. On the 1st of June 1677 Juel defeated the\r\nSwedish admiral Sjöblad off Möen; on the 30th of June 1677 he won his\r\ngreatest victory, in the Bay of Kjöge, where, with 25 ships of the line\r\nand 1267 guns, he routed the Swedish admiral Evert Horn with 36 ships of\r\nthe line and 1800 guns. For this great triumph, the just reward of\r\nsuperior seamanship and strategy--at an early stage of the engagement\r\nJuel's experienced eye told him that the wind in the course of the day\r\nwould shift from S.W. to W. and he took extraordinary risks\r\naccordingly--he was made lieutenant admiral general and a privy\r\ncouncillor. This victory, besides permanently crippling the Swedish\r\nnavy, gave the Danes a self-confidence which enabled them to keep their\r\nDutch allies in their proper place. In the following year Van Tromp,\r\nwhose high-handedness had become unbearable, was discharged by Christian\r\nV., who gave the supreme command to Juel. In the spring of 1678 Juel put\r\nto sea with 84 ships carrying 2400 cannon, but as the Swedes were no\r\nlonger strong enough to encounter such a formidable armament on the open\r\nsea, his operations were limited to blockading the Swedish ports and\r\ntransporting troops to Rügen. After the peace of Lund Juel showed\r\nhimself an administrator and reformer of the first order, and under his\r\nenergetic supervision the Danish navy ultimately reached imposing\r\ndimensions, especially after Juel became chief of the admiralty in\r\n1683. Personally Juel was the noblest and most amiable of men, equally\r\nbeloved and respected by his sailors, simple, straightforward and\r\nunpretentious in all his ways. During his latter years he was popularly\r\nknown in Copenhagen as \"the good old knight.\" He died on the 8th of\r\nApril 1697.\r\n\r\n  See Garde, _Niels Juel_ (1842), and _Den dansk. norske Sömagts\r\n  Historie, 1535-1700_ (1861).     (R. N. B.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUG, a vessel for holding liquid, usually with one handle and a lip,\r\nmade of earthenware, glass or metal. The origin of the word in this\r\nsense is uncertain, but it is probably identical with a shortened form\r\nof the feminine name Joan or Joanna; cf. the similar use of Jack and\r\nJill or Gill for a drinking-vessel or a liquor measure. It has also been\r\nused as a common expression for a homely woman, a servant-girl, a\r\nsweetheart, sometimes in a sense of disparagement. In slang, \"jug\" or\r\n\"stone-jug\" is used to denote a prison; this may possibly be an\r\nadaptation of Fr. _joug_, yoke, Lat. _jugum_. The word \"jug\" is probably\r\nonomatopoeic when used to represent a particular note of the\r\nnightingale's song, or applied locally to various small birds, as the\r\nhedge-jug, &c.\r\n\r\nThe British Museum contains a remarkable bronze jug which was found at\r\nKumasi during the Ashanti Expedition of 1896. It dates from the reign of\r\nRichard II., and is decorated in relief with the arms of England and the\r\nbadge of the king. It has a lid, spout and handle, which ends in a\r\nquatrefoil. An inscription, on three raised bands round the body of the\r\nvessel, modernized runs:--\"He that will not spare when he may shall not\r\nspend when he would. Deem the best in every doubt till the truth be\r\ntried out.\" The _British Museum Guide to the Medieval Room_ contains an\r\nillustration of this vessel.\r\n\r\nA particular form of jug is the \"ewer,\" the precursor of the ordinary\r\nbedroom jug (an adaptation of O. Fr. _ewaire_, med. Lat. _aquaria_,\r\nwater-pitcher, from _aqua_, water). The ewer was a jug with a wide\r\nspout, and was principally used at table for pouring water over the\r\nhands after eating, a matter of some necessity before the introduction\r\nof forks. Early ewers are sometimes mounted on three feet, and bear\r\ninscriptions such as _Venez laver_. A basin of similar material and\r\ndesign accompanied the ewer. In the 13th and 14th centuries a special\r\ntype of metal ewer takes the form of animals, men on horseback, &c.;\r\nthese are generally known as _aquamaniles_, from med. Lat. _aqua manile_\r\nor _aqua manale_ (_aqua_, water, and _manare_, to trickle, pour, drip).\r\nThe British Museum contains several examples.\r\n\r\nIn the 18th and early 19th centuries were made the drinking-vessels of\r\npottery known as \"Toby jugs,\" properly Toby Fillpots or Philpots. These\r\ntake the form of a stout old man, sometimes seated, with a\r\nthree-cornered hat, the corners of which act as spouts. Similar\r\ndrinking-vessels were also made representing characters popular at the\r\ntime, such as \"Nelson jugs,\" &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUGE, BOFFILLE DE (d. 1502), French-Italian adventurer and statesman,\r\nbelonged to the family of del Giudice, which came from Amalfi, and\r\nfollowed the fortunes of the Angevin dynasty. When John of Anjou, duke\r\nof Calabria, was conquered in Italy (1461) and fled to Provence,\r\nBoffille followed him. He was given by Duke John and his father, King\r\nRené, the charge of upholding by force of arms their claims on\r\nCatalonia. Louis XI., who had joined his troops to those of the princes\r\nof Anjou, attached Boffille to his own person, made him his chamberlain\r\nand conferred on him the vice-royalty of Roussillon and Cerdagne (1471),\r\ntogether with certain important lordships, among others the countship of\r\nCastres, confiscated from James of Armagnac, duke of Nemours (1476), and\r\nthe temporalities of the bishopric of Castres, confiscated from John of\r\nArmagnac. He also entrusted him with diplomatic negotiations with\r\nFlanders and England. In 1480 Boffille married Marie d'Albret, sister of\r\nAlain the Great, thus confirming the feudal position which the king had\r\ngiven him in the south. He was appointed as one of the judges in the\r\ntrial of René of Alençon, and showed such zeal in the discharge of his\r\nfunctions that Louis XI. rewarded him by fresh gifts. However, the\r\nbishop of Castres recovered his diocese (1483), and the heirs of the\r\nduke of Nemours took legal proceedings for the recovery of the\r\ncountship of Castres. Boffille, with the object of escaping from his\r\nenemies, applied for the command of the armies of the republic of\r\nVenice. His application was refused, and he further lost the\r\nvice-royalty of Roussillon (1491). His daughter Louise married against\r\nhis will a gentleman of no rank, and this led to terrible family\r\ndissensions. In order to disinherit his own family, Boffille de Juge\r\ngave up the countship of Castres to his brother-in-law, Alain d'Albret\r\n(1494). He died in 1502.\r\n\r\n  See P. M. Perret, _Boffille de Juge, comte de Castres, et la\r\n  république de Venise_ (1891); F. Pasquier, _Inventaire des documents\r\n  concernant Boffille de Juge_ (1905).     (M. P.*)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUGGERNAUT, a corruption of Sans. JAGANNATHA, \"Lord of the World,\" the\r\nname under which the Hindu god Vishnu is worshipped at Puri in Orissa.\r\nThe legend runs that the sacred blue-stone image of Jagannatha was\r\nworshipped in the solitude of the jungle by an outcast, a Savara\r\nmountaineer, called Basu. The king of Malwa, Indradyumna, had despatched\r\nBrahmans to all quarters of the peninsula, and at last discovered Basu.\r\nThereafter the image was taken to Puri, and a temple, begun in 1174, was\r\ncompleted fourteen years later at a cost of upwards of half a million\r\nsterling. The site had been associated for centuries before and after\r\nthe Christian era with Buddhism, and the famous Car festival is probably\r\nbased on the Tooth festival of the Buddhists, of which the Chinese\r\npilgrim Fa-Hien gives an account. The present temple is a pyramidal\r\nbuilding, 192 ft. high, crowned with the mystic wheel and flag of\r\nVishnu. Its inner enclosure, nearly 400 ft. by 300 ft., contains a\r\nnumber of small temples and shrines. The main temple has four main\r\nrooms--the hall of offerings, the dancing hall, the audience chamber,\r\nand the shrine itself--the two latter being each 80 ft. square. The\r\nthree principal images are those of Vishnu, his brother and his sister,\r\ngrotesque wooden figures roughly hewn. Elaborate services are daily\r\ncelebrated all the year round, the images are dressed and redressed, and\r\nfour meals a day are served to them. The attendants on the god are\r\ndivided into 36 orders and 97 classes. Special servants are assigned the\r\ntasks of putting the god to bed, of dressing and bathing him. The annual\r\nrent-roll of the temple was put at £68,000 by Sir W. W. Hunter; but the\r\npilgrims' offerings, which form the bulk of the income, are quite\r\nunknown and have been said to reach as much as £100,000 in one year.\r\nRanjit Singh bequeathed the Koh-i-nor to Jagannath. There are four chief\r\nfestivals, of which the famous Car festival is the most important.\r\n\r\n  The terrible stories of pilgrims crushed to death in the god's honour\r\n  have made the phrase \"Car of Juggernaut\" synonymous with the merciless\r\n  sacrifice of human lives, but these have been shown to be baseless\r\n  calumnies. The worship of Vishnu is innocent of all bloody rites, and\r\n  a drop of blood even accidentally spilt in the god's presence is held\r\n  to pollute the officiating priests, the people, and the consecrated\r\n  food. The Car festival takes place in June or July, and the feature of\r\n  its celebration is the drawing of the god from the temple to his\r\n  \"country-house,\" a distance of less than a mile. The car is 45 ft. in\r\n  height and 35 ft. square, and is supported on 16 wheels of 7 ft. in\r\n  diameter. Vishnu's brother and sister have separate cars, slightly\r\n  smaller. To these cars ropes are attached, and thousands of eager\r\n  pilgrims vie with each other to have the honour of dragging the god.\r\n  Though the distance is so short the journey lasts several days, owing\r\n  to the deep sand in which the wheels sink. During the festival serious\r\n  accidents have often happened. Sir W. W. Hunter in the _Gazetteer of\r\n  India_ writes: \"In a closely packed, eager throng of a hundred\r\n  thousand men and women under the blazing tropical sun, deaths must\r\n  occasionally occur. There have doubtless been instances of pilgrims\r\n  throwing themselves under the wheels in a frenzy of religious\r\n  excitement, but such instances have always been rare, and are now\r\n  unknown. The few suicides that did occur were, for the most part,\r\n  cases of diseased and miserable objects who took this means to put\r\n  themselves out of pain. The official returns now place this beyond\r\n  doubt. Nothing could be more opposed to the spirit of Vishnu-worship\r\n  than self-immolation. Accidental death within the temple renders the\r\n  whole place unclean. According to Chaitanya, the apostle of Jagannath,\r\n  the destruction of the least of God's creatures is a sin against the\r\n  Creator.\"\r\n\r\n  See also Sir W. W. Hunter's _Orissa_ (1872); and _District Gazetteer\r\n  of Puri_ (1908).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUGGLER (Lat. _joculator_, jester), in the modern sense a performer of\r\nsleight-of-hand tricks and dexterous feats of skill in tossing balls,\r\nplates, knives, &c. The term is practically synonymous with conjurer\r\n(see CONJURING). The _joculatores_ were the mimes of the middle ages\r\n(see DRAMA); the French use of the word _jongleurs_ (an erroneous form\r\nof _jougleur_) included the singers known as _trouvères_; and the\r\nhumbler English minstrels of the same type gradually passed into the\r\nstrolling jugglers, from whose exhibitions the term came to cover\r\nloosely any acrobatic, pantomimic and sleight-of-hand performances. In\r\nancient Rome various names were given to what we call jugglers, e.g.\r\n_ventilatores_ (knife-throwers), and _pilarii_ (ball-players).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUGURTHA (Gr. [Greek: Iogorthas]), king of Numidia, an illegitimate son\r\nof Mastanabal, and grandson of Massinissa. After his father's death he\r\nwas brought up by his uncle Micipsa together with his cousins Adherbal\r\nand Hiempsal. Jugurtha grew up strong, handsome and intelligent, a\r\nskilful rider, and an adept in warlike exercises. He inherited much of\r\nMassinissa's political ability. Micipsa, naturally afraid of him, sent\r\nhim to Spain (134 B.C.) in command of a Numidian force, to serve under\r\nP. Cornelius Scipio Africanus Minor. He became a favourite with Scipio\r\nand the Roman nobles, some of whom put into his head the idea of making\r\nhimself sole king of Numidia, with the help of Roman money.\r\n\r\nIn 118 B.C. Micipsa died. By his will, Jugurtha was associated with\r\nAdherbal and Hiempsal in the government of Numidia. Scipio had written\r\nto Micipsa a strong letter of recommendation in favour of Jugurtha; and\r\nto Scipio, accordingly, Micipsa entrusted the execution of his will.\r\nNone the less, his testamentary arrangements utterly failed. The princes\r\nsoon quarrelled, and Jugurtha claimed the entire kingdom. Hiempsal he\r\ncontrived to have assassinated; Adherbal he quickly drove out of\r\nNumidia. He then sent envoys to Rome to defend his usurpation on the\r\nground that he was the injured party. The senate decided that Numidia\r\nwas to be divided, and gave the western, the richer and more populous\r\nhalf, to Jugurtha, while the sands and deserts of the eastern half were\r\nleft to Adherbal. Jugurtha's envoys appear to have found several of the\r\nRoman nobles and senators accessible to bribery. Having secured the best\r\nof the bargain, Jugurtha at once began to provoke Adherbal to a war of\r\nself-defence. He completely defeated him near the modern Philippeville,\r\nand Adherbal sought safety in the fortress of Cirta (Constantine). Here\r\nhe was besieged by Jugurtha, who, notwithstanding the interposition of a\r\nRoman embassy, forced the place to capitulate, and treacherously\r\nmassacred all the inhabitants, among them his cousin Adherbal and a\r\nnumber of Italian merchants resident in the town. There was great wrath\r\nat Rome and throughout Italy; and the senate, a majority of which still\r\nclung to Jugurtha, were persuaded in the same year (111) to declare war.\r\nAn army was despatched to Africa under the consul L. Calpurnius Bestia,\r\nseveral of the Numidian towns voluntarily surrendered, and Bocchus, the\r\nking of Mauretania, and Jugurtha's father-in-law, offered the Romans his\r\nalliance. Jugurtha was alarmed, but having at his command the\r\naccumulated treasures of Massinissa, he was successful in arranging with\r\nthe Roman general a peace which left him in possession of the whole of\r\nNumidia. When the facts were known at Rome, the tribune Memmius insisted\r\nthat Jugurtha should appear in person and be questioned as to the\r\nnegotiations. Jugurtha appeared under a safe conduct, but he had\r\npartisans, such as the tribune C. Baebius, who took care that his mouth\r\nshould be closed. Soon afterwards he caused his cousin Massiva, then\r\nresident at Rome and a claimant to the throne of Numidia, to be\r\nassassinated. The treaty was thereupon set aside, and Jugurtha was\r\nordered to quit Rome. On this occasion he uttered the well-known words,\r\n\"A city for sale, and doomed to perish as soon as it finds a purchaser!\"\r\n(Livy, _Epit._ 64). The war was renewed, and the consul Spurius Albinus\r\nentrusted with the command. The Roman army in Africa was thoroughly\r\ndemoralized. An unsuccessful attempt was made on a fortified town,\r\nSuthul, in which the royal treasures were deposited. The army was\r\nsurprised by the enemy in a night attack, and the camp was taken and\r\nplundered. Every Roman was driven out of Numidia, and a disgraceful\r\npeace was concluded (109).\r\n\r\nBy this time the feeling at Rome and in Italy against the corruption and\r\nincapacity of the nobles had become so strong that a number of senators\r\nwere prosecuted and Bestia and Albinus sentenced to exile. The war was\r\nnow entrusted to Quintus Metellus, an able soldier and stern\r\ndisciplinarian, and from the year 109 to its close in 106 the contest\r\nwas carried on with credit to the Roman arms. Jugurtha was defeated on\r\nthe river Muthul, after an obstinate and skilful resistance. Once again,\r\nhowever, he succeeded in surprising the Roman camp and forcing Metellus\r\ninto winter quarters. There were fresh negotiations, but Metellus\r\ninsisted on the surrender of the king's person, and this Jugurtha\r\nrefused. Numidia on the whole seemed disposed to assert its\r\nindependence, and Rome had before her the prospect of a troublesome\r\nguerrilla war. Negotiations, reflecting little credit on the Romans,\r\nwere set on foot with Bocchus (q.v.) who for a time played fast and\r\nloose with both parties. In 106, Marius was called on by the vote of the\r\nRoman people to supersede Metellus, but it was through the perfidy of\r\nBocchus and the diplomacy of L. Cornelius Sulla, Marius's quaestor, that\r\nthe war was ended. Jugurtha fell into an ambush, and was conveyed a\r\nprisoner to Rome. Two years afterwards, in 104, he figured with his two\r\nsons in Marius's triumph, and in the subterranean prison beneath the\r\nCapitol--\"the bath of ice,\" as he called it--he was either strangled or\r\nstarved to death.\r\n\r\nThough doubtless for a time regarded by his countrymen as their\r\ndeliverer from the yoke of Rome, Jugurtha mainly owes his historical\r\nimportance to the full and minute account of him which we have from the\r\nhand of Sallust, himself afterwards governor of Numidia.\r\n\r\n  See A. H. J. Greenidge, _Hist. of Rome_ (1904); T. Mommsen, _Hist. of\r\n  Rome_, book iv. ch. v.; the chief ancient authorities (besides\r\n  Sallust) are Livy, _Epit._, lxii.-lxvii.; Plutarch, _Marius and\r\n  Sulla_; Velleius Paterculus, ii.; Diod.

It is more generally believed to have been\r\nadapted by the Mandingos directly from Fr. _joujou_, a toy or plaything.\r\nThe word, as used by Europeans on the Guinea coast, was originally\r\napplied to the objects which it was supposed the negroes worshipped, and\r\nwas transferred from the objects themselves to the spirits or gods who\r\ndwelt in them, and finally to the whole religious beliefs of the West\r\nAfricans. It is currently used in each of these senses, and more loosely\r\nto indicate all the manners and customs of the negroes of the Guinea\r\ncoast, particularly the power of interdiction exercised in the name of\r\nspirits (see FETISHISM and TABOO).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUJUBE. Under this name the fruits of at least two species of _Zizyphus_\r\nare usually described, namely, _Z. vulgaris_ and _Z. Jujuba_.[1] The\r\ngenus is a member of the natural order Anacardiaceae. The species are\r\nsmall trees or shrubs, armed with sharp, straight, or hooked spines,\r\nhaving alternate leaves, and fruits which are in most of the species\r\nedible, and have an agreeable acid taste; this is especially the case\r\nwith those of the two species mentioned above.\r\n\r\n_Z. vulgaris_ is a tree about 20 feet high, extensively cultivated in\r\nmany parts of Southern Europe, also in Western Asia, China and Japan. In\r\nIndia it extends from the Punjab to the north-western frontier,\r\nascending in the Punjab Himalaya to a height of 6500 feet, and is found\r\nboth in the wild and cultivated state. The plant is grown almost\r\nexclusively for the sake of its fruit, which both in size and shape\r\nresembles a moderate-sized plum; at first the fruits are green, but as\r\nthey ripen they become of a reddish-brown colour on the outside and\r\nyellow within. They ripen in September, when they are gathered and\r\npreserved by storing in a dry place; after a time the pulp becomes much\r\nsofter and sweeter than when fresh. Jujube fruits when carefully dried\r\nwill keep for a long time, and retain their refreshing acid flavour, on\r\naccount of which they are much valued in the countries of the\r\nMediterranean region as a winter dessert fruit; and, besides, they are\r\nnutritive and demulcent. At one time a decoction was prepared from them\r\nand recommended in pectoral complaints. A kind of thick paste, known as\r\njujube paste, was also made of a composition of gum arabic and sugar\r\ndissolved in a decoction of jujube fruit evaporated to the proper\r\nconsistency.\r\n\r\n_Z. Jujuba_ is a tree averaging from 30 to 50 ft. high, found both wild\r\nand cultivated in China, the Malay Archipelago, Ceylon, India, tropical\r\nAfrica and Australia. Many varieties are cultivated by the Chinese, who\r\ndistinguish them by the shape and size of their fruits, which are not\r\nonly much valued as dessert fruit in China, but are also occasionally\r\nexported to England.\r\n\r\nAs seen in commerce jujube fruits are about the size of a small filbert,\r\nhaving a reddish-brown, shining, somewhat wrinkled exterior, and a\r\nyellow or gingerbread coloured pulp enclosing a hard elongated stone.\r\n\r\nThe fruits of _Zizyphus_ do not enter into the composition of the\r\nlozenges now known as jujubes which are usually made of gum-arabic,\r\ngelatin, &c., and variously flavoured.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] The med. Lat. _jujuba_ is a much altered form of the Gr. [Greek:\r\n    zizuphon]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJU-JUTSU or JIU-JITSU (a Chino-Japanese term, meaning muscle-science),\r\nthe Japanese method of offence and defence without weapons in personal\r\nencounter, upon which is founded the system of physical culture\r\nuniversal in Japan. Some historians assert that it was founded by a\r\nJapanese physician who learned its rudiments while studying in China,\r\nbut most writers maintain that ju-jutsu was in common use in Japan\r\ncenturies earlier, and that it was known in the 7th century B.C.\r\nOriginally it was an art practised solely by the nobility, and\r\nparticularly by the samurai who, possessing the right, denied to\r\ncommoners, of carrying swords, were thus enabled to show their\r\nsuperiority over common people even when without weapons. It was a\r\nsecret art, jealously guarded from those not privileged to use it, until\r\nthe feudal system was abandoned in Japan, and now ju-jutsu is taught in\r\nthe schools, as well as in public and private gymnasia. In the army,\r\nnavy and police it receives particular attention. About the beginning of\r\nthe 20th century, masters of the art began to attract attention in\r\nEurope and America, and schools were established in Great Britain and\r\nthe United States, as well as on the continent of Europe.\r\n\r\nJu-jutsu may be briefly defined as \"an application of anatomical\r\nknowledge to the purpose of offence and defence. It differs from\r\nwrestling in that it does not depend upon muscular strength. It differs\r\nfrom the other forms of attack in that it uses no weapon. Its feat\r\nconsists in clutching or striking such part of an enemy's body as will\r\nmake him numb and incapable of resistance. Its object is not to kill,\r\nbut to incapacitate one for action for the time being\" (Inazo Nitobe,\r\n_Bushido: the Soul of Japan_).\r\n\r\nMany writers translate the term ju-jutsu \"to conquer by yielding\" (Jap.\r\n_ju_, pliant), and this phrase well expresses a salient characteristic\r\nof the art, since the weight and strength of the opponent are employed\r\nto his own undoing. When, for example, a big man rushes at a smaller\r\nopponent, the smaller man, instead of seeking to oppose strength to\r\nstrength, falls backwards or sidewise, pulling his heavy adversary after\r\nhim and taking advantage of his loss of balance to gain some lock or\r\nhold known to the science. This element of yielding in order to conquer\r\nis thus referred to in Lafcadio Hearn's _Out of the East_: \"In jiu-jitsu\r\nthere is a sort of counter for every twist, wrench, pull, push or bend:\r\nonly the jiu-jitsu expert does not oppose such movements. No; he yields\r\nto them. But he does much more than that. He aids them with a wicked\r\nsleight that causes the assailant to put out his own shoulder, to\r\nfracture his own arm, or, in a desperate case, even to break his own\r\nneck or back.\"\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of anatomy mentioned by Nitobe is acquired in order that\r\nthe combatant may know the weak parts of his adversary's body and attack\r\nthem. Several of these sensitive places, for instance the partially\r\nexposed nerve in the elbow popularly known as the \"funny-bone\" and the\r\ncomplex of nerves over the stomach called the solar plexus, are familiar\r\nto the European, but the ju-jutsu expert is acquainted with many others\r\nwhich, when compressed, struck, or pinched, cause temporary paralysis of\r\na more or less complete nature. Such places are the arm-pit, the ankle\r\nand wrist bones, the tendon running downward from the ear, the \"Adam's\r\napple,\" and the nerves of the upper arm. In serious fighting almost any\r\nhold or attack is resorted to, and a broken or badly sprained limb is\r\nthe least that can befall the victim; but in the practice of the art as\r\na means of physical culture the knowledge of the different grips is\r\nassumed on both sides, as well as the danger of resisting too long. For\r\nthis reason the combatant, when he feels himself on the point of being\r\ndisabled, is instructed to signal his acknowledgment of defeat by\r\nstriking the floor with hand or foot. The bout then ends and both\r\ncombatants rise and begin afresh. It will be seen that a victory in\r\nju-jutsu does not mean that the opponent shall be placed in some\r\nparticular position, as in wrestling, but in any position in which his\r\njudgment or knowledge tells him that, unless he yields, he will suffer a\r\ndisabling injury. This difference existed between the wrestling and the\r\n_pancratium_ of the Olympic games. In the _pancratium_ the fight went on\r\nuntil one combatant acknowledged defeat, but, although many a man\r\nallowed himself to be beaten into insensibility rather than suffer this\r\nhumiliation, it was nevertheless held to be a disgrace to kill an\r\nopponent.\r\n\r\nA modern bout at ju-jutsu usually begins by the combatants taking hold\r\nwith both hands upon the collars of each other's jackets or kimonos,\r\nafter which, upon the word to start being given, the manoeuvring for an\r\nadvantageous grip begins by pushes, pulls, jerks, falls, grips or other\r\nmovements. Once the wrist, ankle, neck, arm or leg of an assailant is\r\nfirmly grasped so that added force will dislocate it, there is nothing\r\nfor the seized man to do, in case he is still on his feet, but go to the\r\nfloor, often being thrown clean over his opponent's head. A fall of this\r\nkind does not necessarily mean defeat, for the struggle proceeds upon\r\nthe floor, where indeed most of the combat takes place, and the ju-jutsu\r\nexpert receives a long training in the art of falling without injury.\r\nBlows are delivered, not with the fist, but with the open hand, the\r\nexterior edge of which is hardened by exercises.\r\n\r\nThe physical training necessary to produce expertness is the most\r\nvaluable feature of ju-jutsu. The system includes a light and nourishing\r\ndiet, plenty of sleep, deep-breathing exercises, an abundance of fresh\r\nair and general moderation in habits, in addition to the actual\r\ngymnastic exercises for the purpose of muscle-building and the\r\ncultivation of agility of eye and mind as well as of body. It is\r\npractised by both sexes in Japan.\r\n\r\nMany attempts have been made in England and America to match ju-jutsu\r\nexperts against wrestlers, mostly of the \"catch-as-catch can\" school,\r\nbut these trials have, almost without exception, proved unsatisfactory,\r\nsince many of the most efficacious tricks of ju-jutsu, such as the\r\nstrangle holds and twists of wrists and ankles, are accounted foul in\r\nwrestling. Nevertheless the Japanese athletes, even when obliged to\r\nforgo these, have usually proved more than a match for European\r\nwrestlers of their own weight.\r\n\r\n  See H. Irving Hancock's _Japanese Physical Training_ (1904); _Physical\r\n  Training for Women by Japanese Methods_ (1904); _The Complete Kano\r\n  Jiu-jitsu_ (_Jiudo_) (1905); M. Ohashi, _Japanese Physical Culture_\r\n  (1904); K. Saito, _Jiu-jitsu Tricks_ (1905).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUJUY, a northern province of the Argentine Republic, bounded N. and\r\nN.W. by Bolivia, N.E., E., S. and S.W. by Salta, and W. by the Los Andes\r\nterritory. Pop. (1895), 49,713; (1905, estimate), 55,450, including many\r\nmestizos. Area, 18,977 sq. m., the greater part being mountainous. The\r\nprovince is traversed from N. to S. by three distinct ranges belonging\r\nto the great central Andean plateau: the Sierra de Santa Catalina, the\r\nSierra de Humahuaca, and the Sierras de Zenta and Santa Victoria. In the\r\nS.E. angle of the province are the low, isolated ranges of Alumbre and\r\nSanta Barbara. Between the more eastern of these ranges are valleys of\r\nsurpassing fertility, watered by the Rio Grande de Jujuy, a large\r\ntributary of the Bermejo. The western part, however, is a high plateau\r\n(parts of which are 11,500 ft. above sea-level), whose general\r\ncharacteristics are those of the _puna_ regions farther west. The\r\nsurface of this high plateau is broken, semi-arid and desolate, having a\r\nvery scanty population and no important industry beyond the breeding of\r\na few goats and the fur-bearing chinchilla. There are two large saline\r\nlagoons: Toro, or Pozuelos, in the N., and Casabindo, or Guayatayoc, in\r\nthe S. The climate is cool, dry and healthy, with violent tempests in\r\nthe summer season. (For a vivid description of this interesting region,\r\nsee F. O'Driscoll, \"A Journey to the North of the Argentine Republic,\"\r\n_Geogr. Jour._ xxiv. 1904.) The agricultural productions of Jujuy\r\ninclude sugar cane, wheat, Indian corn, alfalfa and grapes. The breeding\r\nof cattle and mules for the Bolivian and Chilean markets is an old\r\nindustry. Coffee has been grown in the department of Ledesma, but only\r\nto a limited extent. There are also valuable forest areas and\r\nundeveloped mineral deposits. Large borax deposits are worked in the\r\nnorthern part of the province, the output in 1901 having been 8000 tons.\r\nThe province is traversed from S. to N. by the Central Northern railway,\r\na national government line, which has been extended to the Bolivian\r\nfrontier. It passes through the capital and up the picturesque Humahuaca\r\nvalley, and promises, under capable management, to be an important\r\ninternational line, affording an outlet for southern Bolivia. The\r\nclimate of the lower agricultural districts is tropical, and irrigation\r\nis employed in some places in the long dry season.\r\n\r\nThe capital, Jujuy (estimated pop. 1905, 5000), is situated on the Rio\r\nGrande at the lower end of the Humahuaca valley, 942 m. from Buenos\r\nAires by rail. It was founded in 1593 and is 4035 ft. above sea-level.\r\nIt has a mild, temperate climate and picturesque natural surroundings,\r\nand is situated on the old route between Bolivia and Tucuman, but its\r\ngrowth has been slow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUKES, JOSEPH BEETE (1811-1869), English geologist, was born at Summer\r\nHill, near Birmingham, on the 10th of October 1811. He took his degree\r\nat Cambridge in 1836. He began the study of geology under Sedgwick, and\r\nin 1839 was appointed geological surveyor of Newfoundland. He returned\r\nto England at the end of 1840, and in 1842 sailed as naturalist on board\r\nH.M.S. \"Fly,\" despatched to survey Torres Strait, New Guinea, and the\r\neast coast of Australia. Jukes landed in England again in June 1846, and\r\nin August received an appointment on the geological survey of Great\r\nBritain. The district to which he was first sent was North Wales. In\r\n1847 he commenced the survey of the South Staffordshire coal-field and\r\ncontinued this work during successive years after the close of\r\nfield-work in Wales. The results were published in his _Geology of the\r\nSouth Staffordshire Coal-field_ (1853; 2nd ed. 1859), a work remarkable\r\nfor its accuracy and philosophic treatment. In 1850 he accepted the post\r\nof local director of the geological survey of Ireland. The exhausting\r\nnature of this work slowly but surely wore out even his robust\r\nconstitution and on the 29th of July 1869 he died. For many years he\r\nlectured as professor of geology, first at the Royal Dublin Society's\r\nMuseum of Irish Industry, and afterwards at the Royal College of Science\r\nin Dublin. He was an admirable teacher, and his _Student's Manual_ was\r\nthe favoured textbook of British students for many years. During his\r\nresidence in Ireland he wrote an article \"On the Mode of Formation of\r\nsome of the River-valleys in the South of Ireland\" (_Quarterly Journ.\r\nGeol. Soc._ 1862), and in this now classic essay he first clearly\r\nsketched the origin and development of rivers. In later years he devoted\r\nmuch attention to the relations between the Devonian system and the\r\nCarboniferous rocks and Old Red Sandstone.\r\n\r\n  Jukes wrote many papers that were printed in the London and Dublin\r\n  geological journals and other periodicals. He edited, and in great\r\n  measure wrote, forty-two memoirs explanatory of the maps of the south,\r\n  east and west of Ireland, and prepared a geological map of Ireland on\r\n  a scale of 8 m. to an inch. He was also the author of _Excursions in\r\n  and about Newfoundland_ (2 vols., 1842); _Narrative of the Surveying\r\n  Voyage of H. M. S. \"Fly\"_ (2 vols., 1847); _A Sketch of the Physical\r\n  Structure of Australia_ (1850); _Popular Physical Geology_ (1853);\r\n  _Student's Manual of Geology_ (1857; 2nd ed. 1862; a later edition was\r\n  revised by A. Geikie, 1872); the article \"Geology\" in the _Ency.\r\n  Brit._ 8th ed. (1858) and _School Manual of Geology_ (1863). See\r\n  _Letters, &c., of J. Beete Jukes, edited, with Connecting Memorial\r\n  Notes, by his Sister_ (C. A. Browne) (1871), to which is added a\r\n  chronological list of Jukes's writings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJULIAN (FLAVIUS CLAUDIUS JULIANUS) (331-363), commonly called JULIAN THE\r\nAPOSTATE, Roman emperor, was born in Constantinople in 331,[1] the son\r\nof Julius Constantius and his wife Basilina, and nephew of Constantine\r\nthe Great. He was thus a member of the dynasty under whose auspices\r\nChristianity became the established religion of Rome. The name Flavius\r\nhe inherited from his paternal grandfather Constantius Chlorus; Julianus\r\ncame from his maternal grandfather; Claudius had been assumed by\r\nConstantine's family in order to assert a connexion with Claudius\r\nGothicus.\r\n\r\nJulian lost his mother not many months after he was born. He was only\r\nsix when his imperial uncle died; and one of his earliest memories must\r\nhave been the fearful massacre of his father and kinsfolk, in the\r\ninterest and more or less at the instigation of the sons of Constantine.\r\nOnly Julian and his elder half-brother Gallus were spared, Gallus being\r\ntoo ill and Julian too young to excite the fear or justify the cruelty\r\nof the murderers. Gallus was banished, but Julian was allowed to remain\r\nin Constantinople, where he was carefully educated under the supervision\r\nof the family eunuch Mardonius, and of Eusebius, bishop of Nicomedia.\r\nAbout 344 Gallus was recalled, and the two brothers were removed to\r\nMacellum, a remote and lonely castle in Cappadocia. Julian was trained\r\nto the profession of the Christian religion; but he became early\r\nattracted to the old faith, or rather to the idealized amalgam of\r\npaganism and philosophy which was current among his teachers, the\r\nrhetoricians. Cut off from all sympathy with the reigning belief by the\r\nterrible fate of his family, and with no prospect of a public career, he\r\nturned with all the eagerness of an enthusiastic temperament to the\r\nliterary and philosophic studies of the time. The old Hellenic world had\r\nan irresistible attraction for him. Love for its culture was in Julian's\r\nmind intimately associated with loyalty to its religion.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the course of events had left as sole autocrat of the\r\nRoman Empire his cousin Constantius, who, feeling himself unequal to the\r\nenormous task, called Julian's brother Gallus to a share of power, and\r\nin March 351 appointed him Caesar. At the same time Julian was permitted\r\nto return to Constantinople, where he studied grammar under Nicocles and\r\nrhetoric under the Christian sophist Hecebolius. After a short stay in\r\nthe capital Julian was ordered to remove to Nicomedia, where he made the\r\nacquaintance of some of the most eminent rhetoricians of the time, and\r\nbecame confirmed in his secret devotion to the pagan faith. He promised\r\nnot to attend the lectures of Libanius, but bought and read them. But\r\nhis definite conversion to paganism was attributed to the neo-platonist\r\nMaximus of Ephesus, who may have visited him at Nicomedia. The downfall\r\nof Gallus (354), who had been appointed governor of the East, again\r\nexposed Julian to the greatest danger. By his rash and headstrong\r\nconduct Gallus had incurred the enmity of Constantius and the eunuchs,\r\nhis confidential ministers, and was put to death. Julian fell under a\r\nlike suspicion, and narrowly escaped the same fate. For some months he\r\nwas confined at Milan (_Mediolanum_) till at the intercession of the\r\nempress Eusebia, who always felt kindly towards him, permission was\r\ngiven him to retire to a small property in Bithynia. While he was on his\r\nway, Constantius recalled him, but allowed--or rather ordered--him to\r\ntake up his residence at Athens. The few months he spent there\r\n(July-October 355) were probably the happiest of his life.\r\n\r\nThe emperor Constantius and Julian were now the sole surviving male\r\nmembers of the family of Constantine; and, as the emperor again felt\r\nhimself oppressed by the cares of government, there was no alternative\r\nbut to call Julian to his assistance. At the instance of the empress he\r\nwas summoned to Milan, where Constantius bestowed upon him the hand of\r\nhis sister Helena, together with the title of Caesar and the government\r\nof Gaul.\r\n\r\nA task of extreme difficulty awaited him beyond the Alps. During recent\r\ntroubles the Alamanni and other German tribes had crossed the Rhine;\r\nthey had burned many flourishing cities, and extended their ravages far\r\ninto the interior of Gaul. The internal government of the province had\r\nalso fallen into great confusion. In spite of his inexperience, Julian\r\nquickly brought affairs into order. He completely overthrew the Alamanni\r\nin the great battle of Strassburg (August 357). The Frankish tribes\r\nwhich had settled on the western bank of the lower Rhine were reduced to\r\nsubmission. In Gaul he rebuilt the cities which had been laid waste,\r\nre-established the administration on a just and secure footing, and as\r\nfar as possible lightened the taxes, which weighed so heavily on the\r\npoor provincials. Paris was the usual residence of Julian during his\r\ngovernment of Gaul, and his name has become inseparably associated with\r\nthe early history of the city.\r\n\r\nJulian's reputation was now established. He was general of a victorious\r\narmy enthusiastically attached to him and governor of a province which\r\nhe had saved from ruin; but he had also become an object of fear and\r\njealousy at the imperial court. Constantius accordingly resolved to\r\nweaken his power. A threatened invasion of the Persians was made an\r\nexcuse for withdrawing some of the best legions from the Gallic army.\r\nJulian recognized the covert purpose of this, yet proceeded to fulfil\r\nthe commands of the emperor. A sudden movement of the legions themselves\r\ndecided otherwise. At Paris, on the night of the parting banquet, they\r\nforced their way into Julian's tent, and, proclaiming him emperor,\r\noffered him the alternative either of accepting the lofty title or of an\r\ninstant death. Julian accepted the empire, and sent an embassy with a\r\ndeferential message to Constantius. The message being contemptuously\r\ndisregarded, both sides prepared for a decisive struggle. After a march\r\nof unexampled rapidity through the Black Forest and down the Danube,\r\nJulian reached Sirmium, and was on the way to Constantinople, when he\r\nreceived news of the death of Constantius, who had set out from Syria to\r\nmeet him, at Mopsucrene in Cilicia (Nov. 3, 361). Without further\r\ntrouble Julian found himself everywhere acknowledged the sole ruler of\r\nthe Roman Empire; it is even asserted that Constantius himself on his\r\ndeath-bed had designated him his successor. Julian entered\r\nConstantinople on the 11th of December 361.\r\n\r\nJulian had already made a public avowal of paganism, of which he had\r\nbeen a secret adherent from the age of twenty. It was no ordinary\r\nprofession, but the expression of a strong and even enthusiastic\r\nconviction; the restoration of the pagan worship was to be the great aim\r\nand controlling principle of his government. His reign was too short to\r\nshow what precise form the pagan revival might ultimately have taken,\r\nhow far his feelings might have become embittered by his conflict with\r\nthe Christian faith, whether persecution, violence and civil war might\r\nnot have taken the place of the moral suasion which was the method he\r\noriginally affected. He issued an edict of universal toleration; but in\r\nmany respects he used his imperial influence unfairly to advance the\r\nwork of restoration. In order to deprive the Christians of the\r\nadvantages of culture, and discredit them as an ignorant sect, he\r\nforbade them to teach rhetoric. The symbols of paganism and of the\r\nimperial dignity were so artfully interwoven on the standards of the\r\nlegions that they could not pay the usual homage to the emperor without\r\nseeming to offer worship to the gods; and, when the soldiers came\r\nforward to receive the customary donative, they were required to throw a\r\nhandful of incense on the altar. Without directly excluding Christians\r\nfrom the high offices of state, he held that the worshippers of the gods\r\nought to have the preference. In short, though there was no direct\r\npersecution, he exerted much more than a moral pressure to restore the\r\npower and prestige of the old faith.\r\n\r\nHaving spent the winter of 361-362 at Constantinople, Julian proceeded\r\nto Antioch to prepare for his great expedition against Persia. His stay\r\nthere was a curious episode in his life. It is doubtful whether his\r\npagan convictions or his ascetic life, after the fashion of an antique\r\nphilosopher, gave most offence to the so-called Christians of the\r\ndissolute city. They soon grew heartily tired of each other, and Julian\r\ntook up his winter quarters at Tarsus, from which in early spring he\r\nmarched against Persia. At the head of a powerful and well-appointed\r\narmy he advanced through Mesopotamia and Assyria as far as Ctesiphon,\r\nnear which he crossed the Tigris, in face of a Persian army which he\r\ndefeated. Misled by the treacherous advice of a Persian nobleman, he\r\ndesisted from the siege, and set out to seek the main army of the enemy\r\nunder Shapur II. (q.v.). After a long, useless march he was forced to\r\nretreat, and found himself enveloped by the whole Persian army, in a\r\nwaterless and desolate country, at the hottest season of the year. The\r\nRomans repulsed the enemy in many an obstinate battle, but on the 26th\r\nof June 363 Julian, who was ever in the front, was mortally wounded. The\r\nsame night he died in his tent. In the most authentic historian of his\r\nreign, Ammianus Marcellinus, we find a noble speech, which he is said to\r\nhave addressed to his afflicted officers. Soon after his death the\r\nrumour spread that the fatal wound had been inflicted by a Christian in\r\nthe Roman army. The well-known statement, first found in Theodoret (fl.\r\n5th century), that Julian threw his blood towards heaven, exclaiming,\r\n\"Thou hast conquered, O Galilean!\" is probably a development of the\r\naccount of his death in the poems of Ephraem Syrus.\r\n\r\nFrom Julian's unique position as the last champion of a dying\r\npolytheism, his character has always excited interest. Authors such as\r\nGregory of Nazianzus have heaped the fiercest anathemas upon him; but a\r\njust and sympathetic criticism finds many noble qualities in his\r\ncharacter. In childhood and youth he had learned to regard Christianity\r\nas a persecuting force. The only sympathetic friends he met were among\r\nthe pagan rhetoricians and philosophers; and he found a suitable outlet\r\nfor his restless and inquiring mind only in the studies of ancient\r\nGreece. In this way he was attracted to the old paganism; but it was a\r\npaganism idealized by the philosophy of the time.\r\n\r\nIn other respects Julian was no unworthy successor of the Antonines.\r\nThough brought up in a studious and pedantic solitude, he was no sooner\r\ncalled to the government of Gaul than he displayed all the energy, the\r\nhardihood and the practical sagacity of an old Roman. In temperance,\r\nself-control and zeal for the public good, as he understood it, he was\r\nunsurpassed. To these Roman qualities he added the culture, literary\r\ninstincts and speculative curiosity of a Greek. One of the most\r\nremarkable features of his public life was the perfect ease and mastery\r\nwith which he associated the cares of war and statesmanship with the\r\nassiduous cultivation of literature and philosophy. Yet even his\r\ndevotion to culture was not free from pedantry and dilettantism. His\r\ncontemporaries observed in him a want of naturalness. He had not the\r\nmoral health or the composed and reticent manhood of a Roman, or the\r\nspontaneity of a Greek. He was never at rest; in the rapid torrent of\r\nhis conversation he was apt to run himself out of breath; his manner was\r\njerky and spasmodic. He showed quite a deferential regard for the\r\nsophists and rhetoricians of the time, and advanced them to high offices\r\nof state; there was real cause for fear that he would introduce the\r\ngovernment of pedants in the Roman empire. Last of all, his love for the\r\nold philosophy was sadly disfigured by his devotion to the old\r\nsuperstitions. He was greatly given to divination; he was noted for the\r\nnumber of his sacrificial victims. Wits applied to him the joke that had\r\nbeen passed on Marcus Aurelius: \"The white cattle to Marcus Caesar,\r\ngreeting. If you conquer, there is an end of us.\"\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--The works of Julian, of which there are complete\r\n  editions by E. Spanheim (Leipzig, 1696) and F. C. Hertlein (Teubner\r\n  series, 1875-1876), consist of the following: (1) _Letters_, of which\r\n  more than eighty have been preserved under his name, although the\r\n  genuineness of several has been disputed. For his views on religious\r\n  toleration and his attitude towards Christians and Jews the most\r\n  important are 25-27, 51, 52, and the fragment in Hertlein, i. 371. The\r\n  letter of Gallus to Julian, warning him against reverting to\r\n  heathenism, is probably a Christian forgery. Six new letters were\r\n  discovered in 1884 by A. Papadopulos Kerameus in a monastery on the\r\n  island of Chalcis near Constantinople (see _Rheinisches Museum_,\r\n  xlii., 1887). Separate edition of the letters by L. H. Heyler (1828);\r\n  see also J. Bidez and F. Cumont, \"Recherches sur la tradition MS. des\r\n  lettres de l'empereur Julian\" in _Mémoires couronnés ... publiés par\r\n  l'Acad. royale de Belgique_, lvii. (1898) and F. Cumont, _Sur\r\n  l'authenticité de quelques lettres de Julien_ (1889). (2) _Orations_,\r\n  eight in number--two panegyrics on Constantius, one on the empress\r\n  Eusebia, two theosophical declamations on King Helios and the Mother\r\n  of the Gods, two essays on true and false cynicism, and a consolatory\r\n  address to himself on the departure of his friend Salustius to the\r\n  East. (3) _Caesares or Symposium_, a satirical composition after the\r\n  manner of Seneca's _Apocolocyntosis_, in which the deified Caesars\r\n  appear in succession at a banquet given in Olympus, to be censured for\r\n  their vices and crimes by old Silenus. (4) _Misopogon_ (the\r\n  beard-hater), written at Antioch, a satire on the licentiousness of\r\n  its inhabitants; while at the same time his own person and manner of\r\n  life are treated in a whimsical spirit. It also contains a charming\r\n  description of Lutetia (Paris). It owes its name to the ridicule\r\n  heaped upon his beard by the Antiocheans, who were in the habit of\r\n  shaving. (5) Five epigrams, two of which (_Anth. Pal._, ix. 365, 368)\r\n  are of some interest. (6) [Greek: Karà Christianôn] (_Adversus\r\n  Christianos_) in three books, an attack on Christianity written during\r\n  the Persian campaign, is lost. Theodosius II. ordered all copies of it\r\n  to be destroyed, and our knowledge of its contents is derived almost\r\n  entirely from the _Contra Julianum_ of Cyril, bishop of Alexandria,\r\n  written sixty years later (see _Juliani librorum contra Christianos\r\n  quae supersunt_, ed. C. J. Neumann 1880). _English Translations_:\r\n  Select works by J. Duncombe (1784) containing all except the first\r\n  seven orations (viii. and the fable from vii. are included): the\r\n  theosophical addresses to King Helios and the Mother of the Gods by\r\n  Thomas Taylor (1793) and C. W. King in Bohn's _Classical Library_\r\n  (1888); the public letters, by E. J. Chinnock (1901).\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--1. _Ancient_: (a) Pagan writers.

If the former be adopted, Julian must have died in the\r\n    thirty-third, not the thirty-second, year of his age (as stated in\r\n    Ammianus Marcellinus, xxv. 3, 23).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJÜLICH (Fr. _Juliers_), a town of Germany, in the Prussian Rhine\r\nprovince, on the right bank of the Roer, 16 m. N.E. of Aix-la-Chapelle.\r\nPop. (1900), 5459. It contains an Evangelical and two Roman Catholic\r\nchurches, a gymnasium, a school for non-commissioned officers, which\r\noccupies the former ducal palace, and a museum of local antiquities. Its\r\nmanufactures include sugar, leather and paper. Jülich (formerly also\r\nGülch, Guliche) the capital of the former duchy of that name, is the\r\nJuliacum of the _Antonini Itinerarium_; some have attributed its origin\r\nto Julius Caesar. It became a fortress in the 17th century, and was\r\ncaptured by the archduke Leopold in 1609, by the Dutch under Maurice of\r\nOrange in 1610, and by the Spaniards in 1622. In 1794 it was taken by\r\nthe French, who held it until the peace of Paris in 1814. Till 1860,\r\nwhen its works were demolished, Jülich ranked as a fortress of the\r\nsecond class.\r\n\r\nJÜLICH, or JULIERS, DUCHY OF. In the 9th century a certain Matfried was\r\ncount of Jülich (pagus Juliacensis), and towards the end of the 11th\r\ncentury one Gerhard held this dignity. This Gerhard founded a family of\r\nhereditary counts, who held Jülich as immediate vassals of the emperor,\r\nand in 1356 the county was raised to the rank of a duchy. The older and\r\nreigning branch of the family died in 1423, when Jülich passed to\r\nAdolph, duke of Berg (d. 1437), who belonged to a younger branch, and\r\nwho had obtained Berg by virtue of the marriage of one of his\r\nancestors. Nearly a century later Mary (d. 1543) the heiress of these\r\ntwo duchies, married John, the heir of the duchy of Cleves, and in 1521\r\nthe three duchies, Jülich, Berg and Cleves, together with the counties\r\nof Ravensberg and La Marck, were united under John's sway. John died in\r\n1539 and was succeeded by his son William who reigned until 1592.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the 17th century the duchies became very prominent\r\nin European politics. The reigning duke, John William, was childless and\r\ninsane, and several princes were only waiting for his demise in order to\r\nseize his lands. The most prominent of these princes were two Protestant\r\nprinces, Philip Louis, count palatine of Neuburg, who was married to the\r\nduke's sister Anna, and John Sigismund, elector of Brandenburg, whose\r\nwife was the daughter of another sister. Two other sisters were married\r\nto princes of minor importance. Moreover, by virtue of an imperial\r\npromise made in 1485 and renewed in 1495, the elector of Saxony claimed\r\nthe duchies of Jülich and Berg, while the proximity of the coveted lands\r\nto the Netherlands made their fate a matter of great moment to the\r\nDutch. When it is remembered that at this time there was a great deal of\r\ntension between the Roman Catholics and the Protestants, who were fairly\r\nevenly matched in the duchies, and that the rivalry between France and\r\nthe Empire was very keen, it will be seen that the situation lacked no\r\nelement of discord. In March 1609 Duke John William died. Having assured\r\nthemselves of the support of Henry IV. of France and of the Evangelical\r\nUnion, Brandenburg and Neuburg at once occupied the duchies. To counter\r\nthis stroke and to support the Saxon claim, the emperor Rudolph II.\r\nordered some imperialist and Spanish troops to seize the disputed lands,\r\nand it was probably only the murder of Henry IV. in May 1610 and the\r\ndeath of the head of the Evangelical Union, the elector palatine,\r\nFrederick IV., in the following September, which prevented, or rather\r\ndelayed, a great European war. About this time the emperor adjudged the\r\nduchies to Saxony, while the Dutch captured the fortress of Jülich; but\r\nfor all practical purposes victory remained with the \"possessing\r\nprinces,\" as Brandenburg and Neuburg were called, who continued to\r\noccupy and to administer the lands. These two princes had made a compact\r\nat Dortmund in 1609 to act together in defence of their rights, but\r\nproposals for a marriage alliance between the two houses broke down and\r\ndifferences soon arose between them. The next important step was the\r\ntimely conversion of the count palatine's heir, Wolfgang William of\r\nNeuburg, to Roman Catholicism, and his marriage with a daughter of the\r\npowerful Roman Catholic prince, Duke Maximilian of Bavaria. The rupture\r\nbetween the possessing princes was now complete. Each invited foreign\r\naid. Dutch troops marched to assist the elector of Brandenburg and\r\nSpanish ones came to aid the count palatine, but through the\r\nintervention of England and France peace was made and the treaty of\r\nXanten was signed in November 1614. By this arrangement Brandenburg\r\nobtained Jülich and Berg, the rest of the lands falling to the count\r\npalatine. In 1666 the great elector, Frederick William of Brandenburg,\r\nmade with William, count palatine of Neuburg, a treaty of mutual\r\nsuccession to the duchies, providing that in case the male line of\r\neither house became extinct the other should inherit its lands.\r\n\r\nThe succession to the duchy of Jülich was again a matter of interest in\r\nthe earlier part of the 18th century. The family of the counts palatine\r\nof Neuburg was threatened with extinction and the emperor Charles VI.\r\npromised the succession to Jülich to the Prussian king, Frederick\r\nWilliam I., in return for a guarantee of the pragmatic sanction. A\r\nlittle later, however, he promised the same duchy to the count palatine\r\nof Sulzbach, a kinsman of the count palatine of Neuburg. Then Frederick\r\nthe Great, having secured Silesia, abandoned his claim to Jülich, which\r\nthus passed to Sulzbach when, in 1742, the family of Neuburg became\r\nextinct. From Sulzbach the duchy came to the electors palatine of the\r\nRhine, and, when this family died out in 1799, to the elector of\r\nBavaria, the head of the other branch of the house of Wittelsbach. In\r\n1801 Jülich was seized by France, and by the settlement of 1815 it came\r\ninto the hands of Prussia. Its area was just over 1600 sq. m. and its\r\npopulation about 400,000.\r\n\r\n  See Kuhl, _Geschichte der Stadt Jülich_; M.

Stanislas Julien, a mechanic of\r\nOrleans, had two sons, Noël, born on the 13th of April 1797, and\r\nStanislas, born on the 20th of September 1799. It appears that the\r\nyounger son died in America, and that Noël then adopted his brother's\r\nname. He studied classics at the collège de France, and in 1821 was\r\nappointed assistant professor of Greek. In the same year he published an\r\nedition of the [Greek: Helenês harpagê] of Coluthus, with versions in\r\nFrench, Latin, English, German, Italian and Spanish. He attended the\r\nlectures of Abel Rémusat on Chinese, and his progress was as rapid as it\r\nhad been in other languages. From the first, as if by intuition, he\r\nmastered the genius of the language; and in 1824 he published a Latin\r\ntranslation of a part of the works of Mencius (Mang-tse), one of the\r\nnine classical books of the Chinese. Soon afterwards he translated the\r\nmodern Greek odes of Kalvos under the title of _La Lyre patriotique de\r\nla Grèce_. But such works were not profitable in a commercial sense,\r\nand, being without any patrimony, Julien was glad to accept the\r\nassistance of Sir William Drummond and others, until in 1827 he was\r\nappointed sublibrarian to the French institute. In 1832 he succeeded\r\nRémusat as professor of Chinese at the collège de France. In 1833 he was\r\nelected a member of the Académie des Inscriptions in the place of the\r\norientalist, Antoine Jean Saint-Martin. For some years his studies had\r\nbeen directed towards the dramatic and lighter literature of the\r\nChinese, and in rapid succession he now brought out translations of the\r\n_Hoei-lan-ki_ (_L'Histoire du cercle de craie_), a drama in which occurs\r\na scene curiously analogous to the judgment of Solomon; the _Pih shay\r\ntsing ki_; and the _Tchao-chi kou eul_, upon which Voltaire had founded\r\nhis _Orphelin de la Chine_ (1755). With the versatility which belonged\r\nto his genius, he next turned, apparently without difficulty, to the\r\nvery different style common to Taoist writings, and translated in 1835\r\n_Le Livre des récompenses et des peines_ of Lao-tsze. About this time\r\nthe cultivation of silkworms was beginning to attract attention in\r\nFrance, and by order of the minister of agriculture Julien compiled, in\r\n1837, a _Résumé des principaux traités chinois sur la culture des\r\nmûriers, et l'éducation des vers-à-soie_, which was speedily translated\r\ninto English, German, Italian and Russian.\r\n\r\nNothing was more characteristic of his method of studying Chinese than\r\nhis habit of collecting every peculiarity of idiom and expression which\r\nhe met with in his reading; and, in order that others might reap the\r\nbenefit of his experiences, he published in 1841 _Discussions\r\ngrammaticales sur certaines règles de position qui, en chinois, jouent\r\nle même rôle que les inflexions dans les autres langues_, which he\r\nfollowed in 1842 by _Exercices pratiques d'analyse, de syntaxe, et de\r\nlexigraphie chinoise_. Meanwhile in 1839, he had been appointed joint\r\nkeeper of the Bibliothèque royale, with the especial superintendence of\r\nthe Chinese books, and shortly afterwards he was made administrator of\r\nthe collège de France.\r\n\r\nThe facility with which he had learned Chinese, and the success which\r\nhis proficiency commanded, naturally inclined less gifted scholars to\r\nresent the impatience with which he regarded their mistakes, and at\r\ndifferent times bitter controversies arose between Julien and his fellow\r\nsinologues on the one subject which they had in common. In 1842 appeared\r\nfrom his busy pen a translation of the _Tao te King_, the celebrated\r\nwork in which Lao-tsze attempted to explain his idea of the relation\r\nexisting between the universe and something which he called _Tao_, and\r\non which the religion of Taoism is based. From Taoism to Buddhism was a\r\nnatural transition, and about this time Julien turned his attention to\r\nthe Buddhist literature of China, and more especially to the travels of\r\nBuddhist pilgrims to India. In order that he might better understand the\r\nreferences to Indian institutions, and the transcriptions in Chinese of\r\nSanskrit words and proper names, he began the study of Sanskrit, and in\r\n1853 brought out his _Voyages du pélérin Hiouen-tsang_, which is\r\nregarded by some critics as his most valuable work. Six years later he\r\npublished _Les Avadânas, contes et apologues Indiens inconnus jusqu'à ce\r\njour, suivis de poésies et de nouvelles chinoises_. For the benefit of\r\nfuture students he disclosed his system of deciphering Sanskrit words\r\noccurring in Chinese books in his _Méthode pour déchiffrer et transcrire\r\nles noms sanscrits qui se rencontrent dans les livres chinois_ (1861).\r\nThis work, which contains much of interest and importance, falls short\r\nof the value which its author was accustomed to attach to it. It had\r\nescaped his observation that, since the translations of Sanskrit works\r\ninto Chinese were undertaken in different parts of the empire, the same\r\nSanskrit words were of necessity differently represented in Chinese\r\ncharacters in accordance with the dialectical variations. No hard and\r\nfast rule can therefore possibly be laid down for the decipherment of\r\nChinese transcriptions of Sanskrit words, and the effect of this\r\nimpossibility was felt though not recognized by Julien, who in order to\r\nmake good his rule was occasionally obliged to suppose that wrong\r\ncharacters had by mistake been introduced into the texts. His Indian\r\nstudies led to a controversy with Joseph Toussaint Reinaud, which was\r\ncertainly not free from the gall of bitterness. Among the many subjects\r\nto which he turned his attention were the native industries of China,\r\nand his work on the _Histoire et fabrication de la porcelaine chinoise_\r\nis likely to remain a standard work on the subject. In another volume he\r\nalso published an account of the _Industries anciennes et modernes de\r\nl'empire chinois_ (1869), translated from native authorities. In the\r\nintervals of more serious undertakings he translated the _San tseu King_\r\n(_Le Livre des trois mots_); _Thsien tseu wen_ (_Le Livre de mille\r\nmots_); _Les Deux cousines_; _Nouvelles chinoises_; the _Ping chan ling\r\nyen_ (_Les Deux jeunes filles lettrées_); and the _Dialoghi Cinesi_,\r\n_Ji-tch'ang k' eou-t' eou-koa_. His last work of importance was _Syntaxe\r\nnouvelle de la langue chinoise_ (1869), in which he gave the result of\r\nhis study of the language, and collected a vast array of facts and of\r\nidiomatic expressions. A more scientific arrangement and treatment of\r\nhis subject would have added much to the value of this work, which,\r\nhowever, contains a mine of material which amply repays exploration. One\r\ngreat secret by which Julien acquired his grasp of Chinese, was, as we\r\nhave said, his methodical collection of phrases and idiomatic\r\nexpressions. Whenever in the course of his reading he met with a new\r\nphrase or expression, he entered it on a card which took its place in\r\nregular order in a long series of boxes. At his death, which took place\r\non the 14th of February 1873, he left, it is said, 250,000 of such\r\ncards, about the fate of which, however, little seems to be known. In\r\npolitics Julien was imperialist, and in 1863 he was made a commander of\r\nthe legion of honour in recognition of the services he had rendered to\r\nliterature during the second empire.\r\n\r\n  See notice and bibliography by Wallon, _Mém. de l'Acad. des Inscr._\r\n  (1884), xxxi. 409-458.     (R. K. D.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJULIUS, the name of three popes.\r\n\r\nJULIUS I., pope from 337 to 352, was chosen as successor of Marcus after\r\nthe Roman see had been vacant four months. He is chiefly known by the\r\npart which he took in the Arian controversy. After the Eusebians had, at\r\na synod held in Antioch, renewed their deposition of Athanasius they\r\nresolved to send delegates to Constans, emperor of the West, and also to\r\nJulius, setting forth the grounds on which they had proceeded. The\r\nlatter, after expressing an opinion favourable to Athanasius, adroitly\r\ninvited both parties to lay the case before a synod to be presided over\r\nby himself. This proposal, however, the Eastern bishops declined to\r\naccept. On his second banishment from Alexandria, Athanasius came to\r\nRome, and was recognized as a regular bishop by the synod held in 340.\r\nIt was through the influence of Julius that, at a later date, the\r\ncouncil of Sardica in Illyria was held, which was attended only by\r\nseventy-six Eastern bishops, who speedily withdrew to Philippopolis and\r\ndeposed Julius, along with Athanasius and others. The Western bishops\r\nwho remained confirmed the previous decisions of the Roman synod; and by\r\nits 3rd, 4th and 5th decrees relating to the rights of revision, the\r\ncouncil of Sardica endeavoured to settle the procedure of ecclesiastical\r\nappeals. Julius on his death in April 352 was succeeded by Liberius.\r\n     (L. D.*)\r\n\r\nJULIUS II. (Giuliano della Rovere), pope from the 1st of November 1503\r\nto the 21st of February 1513, was born at Savona in 1443. He was at\r\nfirst intended for a commercial career, but later was sent by his uncle,\r\nsubsequently Sixtus IV., to be educated among the Franciscans, although\r\nhe does not appear to have joined that order. He was loaded with favours\r\nduring his uncle's pontificate, being made bishop of Carpentras, bishop\r\nof Bologna, bishop of Vercelli, archbishop of Avignon, cardinal-priest\r\nof S. Pietro in Vincoli and of Sti Dodici Apostoli, and cardinal-bishop\r\nof Sabina, of Frascati, and finally of Ostia and Velletri. In 1480 he\r\nwas made legate to France, mainly to settle the question of the\r\nBurgundian inheritance, and acquitted himself with such ability during\r\nhis two years' stay that he acquired an influence in the college of\r\ncardinals which became paramount during the pontificate of Innocent\r\nVIII. A rivalry, however, growing up between him and Roderigo Borgia, he\r\ntook refuge at Ostia after the latter's election as Alexander VI., and\r\nin 1494 went to France, where he incited Charles VIII. to undertake the\r\nconquest of Naples. He accompanied the young king on his campaign, and\r\nsought to convoke a council to inquire into the conduct of the pope with\r\na view to his deposition, but was defeated in this through Alexander's\r\nmachinations. During the remainder of that pontificate Della Rovere\r\nremained in France, nominally in support of the pope, for whom he\r\nnegotiated the treaty of 1498 with Louis XII., but in reality bitterly\r\nhostile to him. On the death of Alexander (1503) he returned to Italy\r\nand supported the election of Pius III., who was then suffering from an\r\nincurable malady, of which he died shortly afterwards. Della Rovere then\r\nwon the support of Cesare Borgia and was unanimously elected pope.\r\nJulius II. from the beginning repudiated the system of nepotism which\r\nhad flourished under Sixtus IV., Innocent VIII. and Alexander VI., and\r\nset himself with courage and determination to restore, consolidate and\r\nextend the temporal possessions of the Church. By dexterous diplomacy he\r\nfirst succeeded (1504) in rendering it impossible for Cesare Borgia to\r\nremain in Italy. He then pacified Rome and the surrounding country by\r\nreconciling the powerful houses of Orsini and Colonna and by winning the\r\nother nobles to his own cause. In 1504 he arbitrated on the differences\r\nbetween France and Germany, and concluded an alliance with them in order\r\nto oust the Venetians from Faenza, Rimini and other towns which they\r\noccupied. The alliance at first resulted only in compelling the\r\nsurrender of a few unimportant fortresses in the Romagna; but Julius\r\nfreed Perugia and Bologna in the brilliant campaign of 1506. In 1508 he\r\nconcluded against Venice the famous league of Cambray with the emperor\r\nMaximilian, Louis XII. of France and Ferdinand of Aragon, and in the\r\nfollowing year placed the city of Venice under an interdict. By the\r\nsingle battle of Agnadello the Italian dominion of Venice was\r\npractically lost; but as the allies were not satisfied with merely\r\neffecting his purposes, the pope entered into a combination with the\r\nVenetians against those who immediately before had been engaged in his\r\nbehalf. He absolved the Venetians in the beginning of 1510, and shortly\r\nafterwards placed the ban on France. At a synod convened by Louis XII.\r\nat Tours in September, the French bishops announced their withdrawal\r\nfrom the papal obedience and resolved, with Maximilian's co-operation,\r\nto seek the deposition of Julius. In November 1511 a council actually\r\nmet at Pisa for this object, but its efforts were fruitless. Julius\r\nforthwith formed the Holy league with Ferdinand of Aragon and with\r\nVenice against France, in which both Henry VIII. and the emperor\r\nultimately joined. The French were driven out of Italy in 1512 and papal\r\nauthority was once more securely established in the states immediately\r\naround Rome. Julius had already issued, on the 18th of July 1511, the\r\nsummons for a general council to deal with France, with the reform of\r\nthe Church, and with a war against the Turks. This council, which is\r\nknown as the Fifth Lateran, assembled on the 3rd of May 1512, condemned\r\nthe celebrated pragmatic sanction of the French church, and was still\r\nin session when Julius died. In the midst of his combats, Julius never\r\nneglected his ecclesiastical duties. His bull of the 14th of January\r\n1505 against simony in papal elections was re-enacted by the Lateran\r\ncouncil (February 16, 1513). He condemned duelling by bull of the 24th\r\nof February 1509. He effected some reforms in the monastic orders; urged\r\nthe conversion of the sectaries in Bohemia; and sent missionaries to\r\nAmerica, India, Abyssinia and the Congo. His government of the Papal\r\nStates was excellent. Julius is deserving of particular honour for his\r\npatronage of art and literature. He did much to improve and beautify\r\nRome; he laid the foundation-stone of St Peter's (April 18, 1506); he\r\nfounded the Vatican museum; and he was a friend and patron of Bramante,\r\nRaphael and Michelangelo. While moderate in personal expenditure, Julius\r\nresorted to objectionable means of replenishing the papal treasury,\r\nwhich had been exhausted by Alexander VI., and of providing funds for\r\nhis numerous enterprises; simony and traffic in indulgences were\r\nincreasingly prevalent. Julius was undoubtedly in energy and genius one\r\nof the greatest popes since Innocent III., and it is a misfortune of the\r\nChurch that his temporal policy eclipsed his spiritual office. Though\r\nnot despising the Machiavellian arts of statecraft so universally\r\npractised in his day, he was nevertheless by nature plain-spoken and\r\nsincere, and in his last years grew violent and crabbed. He died of a\r\nfever on the 21st of February 1513, and was succeeded by Leo X.\r\n\r\n  See L. Pastor, _History of the Popes_, vol. vi., trans. by F. I.\r\n  Antrobus (1898); M.

(Giovanni Maria del Monte), pope from 1550 to 1555, was born\r\non the 10th of September 1487. He was created cardinal by Paul III. in\r\n1536, filled several important legations, and was elected pope on the\r\n7th of February 1550, despite the opposition of Charles V., whose enmity\r\nhe had incurred as president of the council of Trent. Love of ease and\r\ndesire for peace moved him, however, to adopt a conciliatory attitude,\r\nand to yield to the emperor's desire for the reassembling of the council\r\n(September 1551), suspended since 1549. But deeming Charles's further\r\ndemands inconvenient, he soon found occasion in the renewal of\r\nhostilities to suspend the council once more (April 1552). As an\r\nadherent of the emperor he suffered in consequence of imperial reverses,\r\nand was forced to confirm Parma to Ottavio Farnese, the ally of France\r\n(1552). Weary of politics, and obeying a natural inclination to\r\npleasure, Julius then virtually abdicated the management of affairs, and\r\ngave himself up to enjoyment, amusing himself with the adornment of his\r\nvilla, near the Porta del Popolo, and often so far forgetting the\r\nproprieties of his office as to participate in entertainments of a\r\nquestionable character. His nepotism was of a less ambitious order than\r\nthat of Paul III.; but he provided for his family out of the offices and\r\nrevenues of the Church, and advanced unworthy favourites to the\r\ncardinalate. What progress reform made during his pontificate was due to\r\nits acquired momentum, rather than to the zeal of the pope. Yet under\r\nJulius steps were taken to abolish plurality of benefices and to restore\r\nmonastic discipline; the Collegium Germanicum, for the conversion of\r\nGermans, was established in Rome, 1552; and England was absolved by the\r\ncardinal-legate Pole, and received again into the Roman communion\r\n(1554). Julius died on the 23rd of March 1555, and was succeeded by\r\nMarcellus II.\r\n\r\n  See Panvinio, continuator of Platina, _De Vitis Pontiff.

His fondness for the lightest forms of music\r\ncost him his position in the school, and after conducting the band of\r\nthe Jardin Turc he was compelled to leave Paris to escape his creditors,\r\nand came to London, where he formed a good orchestra and established\r\npromenade concerts. Subsequently he travelled to Scotland, Ireland and\r\nAmerica with his orchestra. For many years he was a familiar figure in\r\nthe world of popular music in England, and his portly form with its\r\ngorgeous waistcoats occurs very often in the early volumes of _Punch_.\r\nHe brought out an opera, _Pietro il Grande_, at Covent Garden (1852) on\r\na scale of magnificence that ruined him, for the piece was a complete\r\nfailure. He was in America until 1854, when he returned to London for a\r\nshort time; ultimately he went back to Paris, where, in 1859, he was\r\narrested for debt and put into prison. He lost his reason soon\r\nafterwards, and died on the 14th of March 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJULLUNDUR, or JALANDHAR, a city of British India, giving its name to a\r\ndistrict and a division in the Punjab. The city is 260 m. by rail N.W.\r\nof Delhi. Pop. (1901), 67,735. It is the headquarters of a brigade in\r\nthe 3rd division of the northern army. There are an American\r\nPresbyterian mission, a government normal school, and high schools\r\nsupported by Hindu bodies.\r\n\r\nThe DISTRICT OF JULLUNDUR occupies the lower part of the tract known as\r\nthe Jullundur Doab, between the rivers Sutlej and Beas, except that it\r\nis separated from the Beas by the state of Kapurthala. Area, 1431 sq. m.\r\nPop. (1901), 917,587, showing an increase of 1% in the decade; the\r\naverage density is 641 persons per square mile, being the highest in the\r\nprovince. Cotton-weaving and sugar manufacture are the principal\r\nindustries for export trade, and silk goods and wheat are also exported.\r\nThe district is crossed by the main line of the North-Western railway\r\nfrom Phillaur towards Amritsar.\r\n\r\nThe Jullundur Doab in early times formed the Hindu kingdom of Katoch,\r\nruled by a family of Rajputs whose descendants still exist in the petty\r\nprinces of the Kangra hills. Under Mahommedan rule the Doab was\r\ngenerally attached to the province of Lahore, in which it is included as\r\na _circar_ or governorship in the great revenue survey of Akbar. Its\r\ngovernors seem to have held an autonomous position, subject to the\r\npayment of a fixed tribute into the imperial treasury. The Sikh revival\r\nextended to Jullundur at an early period, and a number of petty\r\nchieftains made themselves independent throughout the Doab. In 1766 the\r\ntown of Jullundur fell into the hands of the Sikh confederacy of\r\nFaiz-ulla-puria, then presided over by Khushal Singh. His son and\r\nsuccessor built a masonry fort in the town, while several other leaders\r\nsimilarly fortified themselves in the suburbs. Meanwhile, Ranjit Singh\r\nwas consolidating his power in the south, and in 1811 he annexed the\r\nFaiz-ulla-puria dominions. Thenceforth Jullundur became the capital of\r\nthe Lahore possessions in the Doab until the British annexation at the\r\nclose of the first Sikh war (1846).\r\n\r\nThe DIVISION OF JULLUNDUR comprises the five districts of Kangra,\r\nHoshiarpur, Jullundur, Ludhiana and Ferozepore, all lying along the\r\nriver Sutlej. Area, 19,410 sq. m. Pop. (1901), 4,306,662.\r\n\r\n  See _Jullundur District Gazetteer_ (Lahore, 1908).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJULY, the seventh month in the Christian calendar, consisting of\r\nthirty-one days. It was originally the fifth month of the year, and as\r\nsuch was called by the Romans _Quintilis_. The later name of Julius was\r\ngiven in honour of Julius Caesar (who was born in the month); it came\r\ninto use in the year of his death. The Anglo-Saxons called July\r\n_Hegmônath_, \"hay-month,\" or _Maed-mônath_, \"mead-month,\" the meadows\r\nbeing then in bloom. Another name was _aftera lîða_, \"the latter mild\r\nmonth,\" in contradistinction to June, which was named \"the former mild\r\nmonth.\" Chief dates of the month: 3rd July, Dog Days begin; 15th July,\r\nSt Swithin; 25th July, St James.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUMALA, the supreme god of the ancient Finns and Lapps. Among some\r\ntribes he is called Num or Jilibeambaertje, as protector of the flocks.\r\nJumala indicates rather godhead than a divine being. In the runes Ukko,\r\nthe grandfather, the sender of the thunder, takes the place of Jumala.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUMIÈGES, a village of north-western France, in the department of\r\nSeine-Inférieure, 17 m. W. of Rouen by road, on a peninsula formed by a\r\nbend of the Seine. Pop. (1906), 244. Jumièges is famous for the imposing\r\nruins of its abbey, one of the great establishments of the Benedictine\r\norder. The principal remains are those of the abbey-church, built from\r\n1040 to 1067; these comprise the façade with two towers, the walls of\r\nthe nave, a wall and sustaining arch of the great central tower and\r\ndébris of the choir (restored in the 13th century). Among the minor\r\nrelics, preserved in a small museum in a building of the 14th century,\r\nare the stone which once covered the grave of Agnes Sorel, and two\r\nrecumbent figures of the 13th century, commonly known as the _Énervés_,\r\nand representing, according to one legend, two sons of Clovis II., who,\r\nas a punishment for revolt against their father, had the tendons of\r\ntheir arms and legs cut, and were set adrift in a boat on the Seine.\r\nAnother tradition states that the statues represent Thassilo, duke of\r\nBavaria, and Theodo his son, relegated to Jumièges by Charlemagne. The\r\nchurch of St Pierre, which adjoins the south side of the abbey-church,\r\nwas built in the 14th century as a continuation of a previous church of\r\nthe time of Charlemagne, of which a fragment still survives. Among the\r\nother ruins, those of the chapter-house (13th century) and refectory\r\n(12th and 15th centuries) also survive.\r\n\r\nThe abbey of Jumièges was founded about the middle of the 7th century by\r\nSt Philibert, whose name is still to be read on gold and silver coins\r\nobtained from the site. The abbey was destroyed by the Normans, but was\r\nrebuilt in 928 by William Longsword, duke of Normandy, and continued to\r\nexist till 1790. Charles VII. often resided there with Agnes Sorel, who\r\nhad a manor at Mesnil-sous-Jumièges in the neighbourhood, and died in\r\nthe monastery in 1450.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUMILLA, a town of eastern Spain, in the province of Murcia, 40 m. N. by\r\nW. of Murcia by road, on the right bank of the Arroyo del Jua, a\r\nleft-bank tributary of the Segura. Pop. (1900), 16,446. Jumilla occupies\r\npart of a narrow valley, enclosed by mountains. An ancient citadel,\r\nseveral churches, a Franciscan convent, and a hospital are the principal\r\nbuildings. The church of Santiago is noteworthy for its fine paintings\r\nand frescoes, some of which have been attributed, though on doubtful\r\nauthority, to Peter Paul Rubens and other illustrious artists. The local\r\ntrade is chiefly in coarse cloth, esparto fabrics, wine and farm\r\nproduce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUMNA, or JAMUNA, a river of northern India. Rising in the Himalayas in\r\nTehri state, about 5 m. N. of the Jamnotri hot springs, in 31° 3´ N. and\r\n78° 30´ E., the stream first flows S. for 7 m., then S.W. for 32 m., and\r\nafterwards due S. for 26 m., receiving several small tributaries in its\r\ncourse. It afterwards turns sharply to the W. for 14 m., when it is\r\njoined by the large river Tons from the north. The Jumna here emerges\r\nfrom the Himalayas into the valley of the Dun, and flows in a S.W.\r\ndirection for 22 m., dividing the Kiarda Dun on the W. from the Dehra\r\nDun on the E. It then, at the 95th mile of its course, forces its way\r\nthrough the Siwalik hills, and debouches upon the plains of India at\r\nFyzabad in Saharanpur district. By this time a large river, it gives\r\noff, near Fyzabad, the eastern and western Jumna canals. From Fyzabad\r\nthe river flows for 65 m. in a S.S.W. direction, receiving the Maskarra\r\nstream from the east. Near Bidhauli, in Muzaffarnagar district, it turns\r\ndue S. for 80 m. to Delhi city, thence S.E. for 27 m. to near Dankaur,\r\nreceiving the waters of the Hindan river on the east. From Dankaur it\r\nresumes its southerly course for 100 m. to Mahaban near Muttra, where it\r\nturns E. for nearly 200 m., passing the towns of Agra, Ferozabad and\r\nEtawah, receiving on its left bank the Karwan-nadi, and on its right the\r\nBanganga (Utanghan). From Etawah it flows 140 m. S.E. to Hamirpur, being\r\njoined by the Sengar on its north bank, and on the south by the great\r\nriver Chambal from the west, and by the Sind. From Hamirpur, the Jumna\r\nflows nearly due E., until it enters Allahabad district and passes\r\nAllahabad city, below which it falls into the Ganges in 25° 25´ N. and\r\n81° 55´ E. In this last part of its course it receives the waters of the\r\nBetwa and the Ken. Where the Jumna and the Ganges unite is the _prayag_,\r\nor place of pilgrimage, where devout Hindus resort in thousands to wash\r\nand be sanctified.\r\n\r\nThe Jumna, after issuing from the hills, has a longer course through the\r\nUnited Provinces than the Ganges, but is not so large nor so important a\r\nriver; and above Agra in the hot season it dwindles to a small stream.\r\nThis is no doubt partly caused by the eastern and western Jumna canals,\r\nof which the former, constructed in 1823-1830, irrigates 300,000 acres\r\nin the districts of Saharanpur, Muzaffarnagar and Meerut, in the United\r\nProvinces; while the latter, consisting of the reopened channels of two\r\ncanals dating from about 1350 and 1628 respectively, extends through the\r\ndistricts of Umballa, Karnal, Hissar, Rohtak and Delhi, and the native\r\nstates of Patiala and Jind in the Punjab, irrigating 600,000 acres. The\r\nheadworks of the two canals are situated near the point where the river\r\nissues from the Siwaliks.\r\n\r\nThe traffic on the Jumna is not very considerable; in its upper portion\r\ntimber, and in the lower stone, grain and cotton are the chief articles\r\nof commerce, carried in the clumsy barges which navigate its stream. Its\r\nwaters are clear and blue, while those of the Ganges are yellow and\r\nmuddy; the difference between the streams can be discerned for some\r\ndistance below the point at which they unite. Its banks are high and\r\nrugged, often attaining the proportions of cliffs, and the ravines which\r\nrun into it are deeper and larger than those of the Ganges. It traverses\r\nthe extreme edge of the alluvial plain of Hindustan, and in the latter\r\npart of its course it almost touches the Bundelkhand offshoots of the\r\nVindhya range of mountains. Its passage is therefore more tortuous, and\r\nthe scenery along its banks more varied and pleasing, than is the case\r\nwith the Ganges.\r\n\r\nThe Jumna at its source near Jamnotri is 10,849 ft. above the sea-level;\r\nat Kotnur, 16 m. lower, it is only 5036 ft.; so that, between these two\r\nplaces, it falls at the rate of 314 ft. in a mile. At its junction with\r\nthe Tons it is 1686 ft. above the sea; at its junction with the Asan,\r\n1470 ft.; and at the point where it issues from the Siwalik hills into\r\nthe plains, 1276 ft. The catchment area of the river is 118,000 sq. m.;\r\nits flood discharge at Allahabad is estimated at 1,333,000 cub. ft. per\r\nsecond. The Jumna is crossed by railway bridges at Delhi, Muttra, Agra\r\nand Allahabad, while bridges of boats are stationed at many places.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUMPING,[1] a branch of athletics which has been cultivated from the\r\nearliest times (see ATHLETIC SPORTS). Leaping competitions formed a part\r\nof the _pentathlon_, or quintuple games, of the Olympian festivals, and\r\nGreek chronicles record that the athlete Phayllus jumped a distance of\r\n55 Olympian, or more than 30 English, feet. Such a leap could not have\r\nbeen made without weights carried in the hands and thrown backwards at\r\nthe moment of springing. These were in fact employed by Greek jumpers\r\nand were called _halteres_. They were masses of stone or metal, nearly\r\nsemicircular, according to Pausanias, and the fingers grasped them like\r\nthe handles of a shield. Halteres were also used for general exercise,\r\nlike modern dumb-bells. The Olympian jumping took place to the music of\r\nlutes.\r\n\r\nJumping has always been popular with British athletes, and tradition has\r\nhanded down the record of certain leaps that border on the incredible.\r\nTwo forms of jumping are included in modern athletic contests, the\r\nrunning long jump and the running high jump; but the same jumps, made\r\nfrom a standing position, are also common forms of competition, as well\r\nas the hop step and jump, two hops and jump, two jumps, three jumps,\r\nfive jumps and ten jumps, either with a run or from a standing position.\r\nThese events are again divided into two categories by the use of\r\nweights, which are not allowed in championship contests.\r\n\r\nIn the running long jump anything over 18 ft. was once considered good,\r\nwhile Peter O'Connor's world's record (1901) is 24 ft. 11¾ in. The jump\r\nis made, after a short fast run on a cinder path, from a joist sunk into\r\nthe ground flush with the path, the jumper landing in a pit filled with\r\nloose earth, its level a few inches below that of the path. The joist,\r\ncalled the \"take-off,\" is painted white, and all jumps are measured from\r\nits edge to the nearest mark made by any part of the jumper's person in\r\nlanding.\r\n\r\nIn the standing long jump, well spiked shoes should be worn, for it is\r\nin reality nothing but a push against the ground, and a perfect purchase\r\nis of the greatest importance. Weights held in the hands of course\r\ngreatly aid the jumper. Without weights J. Darby (professional) jumped\r\n12 ft. 1½ in. and R. C. Ewry (American amateur) 11 ft. 4(7/8) in. With\r\nweights J. Darby covered 14 ft. 9 in. at Liverpool in 1890, while the\r\namateur record is 12 ft. 9½ in., made by J. Chandler and G. L. Hellwig\r\n(U.S.A.). The standing two, three, five and ten jumps are merely\r\nrepetitions of the single jump, care being taken to land with the proper\r\nbalance to begin the next leap. The record for two jumps without weights\r\nis 22 ft. 2½ in., made by H. M. Johnson (U.S.A.); for three jumps\r\nwithout weights, R. C. Ewry, 35 ft. 7¼ in.; with weights J. Darby, 41\r\nft. 7 in.\r\n\r\nThe hop step and jump is popular in Ireland and often included in the\r\nprogrammes of minor meetings, and so is the two hops and a jump. The\r\nrecord for the first, made by W. McManus, is 49 ft. 2½ in. with a run\r\nand without weights; for the latter, also with a run and without\r\nweights, 49 ft. ½ in., made by J. B. Conolly.\r\n\r\nIn the running high jump also the standard has improved. In 1864 a jump\r\nof 5 ft. 6 in. was considered excellent. The Scotch professional Donald\r\nDinnie, on hearing that M. J. Brooks of Oxford had jumped 6 ft. 2½ in.\r\nin 1876, wrote to the newspapers to show that upon _a priori_ grounds\r\nsuch an achievement was impossible. Since then many jumpers who can\r\nclear over 6 ft. have appeared. In 1895 M. F. Sweeney of New York\r\naccomplished a jump of 6 ft. 5(5/8) in. Ireland has produced many\r\nfirst-class high jumpers, nearly all tall men, P. Leahy winning the\r\nBritish amateur record in Dublin in 1898 with a jump of 6 ft. 4¾ in. The\r\nAmerican A. Bird Page, however, although only 5 ft. 6¾ in. in height,\r\njumped 6 ft. 4 in. High jumping is done over a light staff or lath\r\nresting upon pins fixed in two uprights upon which a scale is marked.\r\nThe \"take-off,\" or ground immediately in front of the uprights from\r\nwhich the spring is made, is usually grass in Great Britain and cinders\r\nin America. Some jumpers run straight at the bar and clear it with body\r\nfacing forward, the knees being drawn up almost to the chin as the body\r\nclears the bar; others run and spring sideways, the feet being thrown\r\nupwards and over the bar first, to act as a kind of lever in getting the\r\nbody over. There should be a shallow pit of loose earth or a mattress to\r\nbreak the fall.\r\n\r\nThe standing high jump is rarely seen in regular athletic meetings. The\r\njumper stands sideways to the bar with his arms extended upwards. He\r\nthen swings his arms down slowly, bending his knees at the same time,\r\nand, giving his arms a violent upward swing, springs from the ground. As\r\nthe body rises the arms are brought down, one leg is thrown over the\r\nbar, and the other pulled, almost jerked, after it. The record for the\r\nstanding high jump without weights is 6 ft., by J. Darby in 1892.\r\n\r\nBy the use of a spring-board many extraordinary jumps have been made,\r\nbut this kind of leaping is done only by circus gymnasts and is not\r\nrecognized by athletic authorities.\r\n\r\nFor pole-jumping see POLE-VAULTING.\r\n\r\n  See _Encyclopaedia of Sport_; M. W. Ford, \"Running High Jump,\"\r\n  _Outing_, vol. xviii.; \"Running Broad Jump,\" _Outing_, vol. xix.;\r\n  \"Standing Jumping,\" _Outing_, vol. xix.; \"Miscellaneous Jumping,\"\r\n  _Outing_, vol. xx. Also _Sporting and Athletic Register_ (annual).\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] The verb \"to jump\" only dates from the beginning of the 16th\r\n    century. The _New English Dictionary_ takes it to be of onomatopoeic\r\n    origin and does not consider a connexion with Dan. _gumpe_, Icel.\r\n    _goppa_, &c., possible. The earlier English word is \"leap\" (O.E.\r\n    _hléapan_, to run, jump, cf. Ger. _laufen_).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUMPING-HARE, the English equivalent of springhaas, the Boer name of a\r\nlarge leaping south and east African rodent mammal, _Pedetes caffer_,\r\ntypifying a family by itself, the _Pedetidae_. Originally classed with\r\nthe jerboas, to which it has no affinity, this remarkable rodent\r\napproximates in the structure of its skull to the porcupine-group, near\r\nwhich it is placed by some naturalists, although others consider that\r\nits true position is with the African scaly-tailed flying squirrels\r\n(_Anomaluridae_). The colour of the creature is bright rufous fawn; the\r\neyes are large; and the bristles round the muzzle very long, the former\r\nhaving a fringe of long hairs. The front limbs are short, and the hind\r\nones very long; and although the fore-feet have five toes, those of the\r\nhind-feet are reduced to four. The bones of the lower part of the hind\r\nleg (tibia and fibula) are united for a great part of their length.\r\nThere are four pairs of cheek-teeth in each jaw, which do not develop\r\nroots. The jumping-hare is found in open or mountainous districts, and\r\nhas habits very like a jerboa. It is nocturnal, and dwells in composite\r\nburrows excavated and tenanted by several families. When feeding it\r\nprogresses on all four legs, but if frightened takes gigantic leaps on\r\nthe hind-pair alone; the length of such leaps frequently reaches twenty\r\nfeet, or even more. The young are generally three or four in number, and\r\nare born in the summer. A second smaller species has been named. (See\r\nRODENTIA.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUMPING-MOUSE, the name of a North American mouse-like rodent, _Zapus\r\nhudsonius_, belonging to the family _Jaculidae_ (_Dipodidae_), and the\r\nother members of the same genus. Although mouse-like in general\r\nappearance, these rodents are distinguished by their elongated hind\r\nlimbs, and, typically, by the presence of four pairs of cheek-teeth in\r\neach jaw. There are five toes to all the feet, but the first in the\r\nfore-feet is rudimentary, and furnished with a flat nail. The cheeks are\r\nprovided with pouches. Jumping-mice were long supposed to be confined to\r\nNorth America, but a species is now known from N.W. China. It is\r\nnoteworthy that whereas E. Coues in 1877 recognized but a single\r\nrepresentative of this genus, ranging over a large area in North\r\nAmerica, A. Preble distinguishes no fewer than twenty North American\r\nspecies and sub-species, in addition to the one from Szechuen. Among\r\nthese, it may be noted that _Z. insignis_ differs from the typical _Z.\r\nhudsonius_ by the loss of the premolar, and has accordingly been\r\nreferred to a sub-genus apart. Moreover, the Szechuen jumping-mouse\r\ndiffers from the typical _Zapus_ by the closer enamel-folds of the\r\nmolars, the shorter ears, and the white tail-tip, and is therefore made\r\nthe type of another sub-genus. In America these rodents inhabit forest,\r\npasture, cultivated fields or swamps, but are nowhere numerous. When\r\ndisturbed, they start off with enormous bounds of eight or ten feet in\r\nlength, which soon diminish to three or four; and in leaping the feet\r\nscarcely seem to touch the ground. The nest is placed in clefts of\r\nrocks, among timber or in hollow trees, and there are generally three\r\nlitters in a season. (See RODENTIA.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUMPING-SHREW, a popular name for any of the terrestrial insectivora of\r\nthe African family _Macroscelididae_, of which there are a number of\r\nspecies ranging over the African continent, representing the tree-shrews\r\nof Asia. They are small long-snouted gerbil-like animals, mainly\r\nnocturnal, feeding on insects, and characterized by the great length of\r\nthe metatarsal bones, which have been modified in accordance with their\r\nleaping mode of progression. In some (constituting the genus\r\n_Rhyncocyon_) the muzzle is so much prolonged as to resemble a\r\nproboscis, whence the name elephant-shrews is sometimes applied to the\r\nmembers of the family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNAGARH, or JUNAGADH, a native state of India, within the Gujarat\r\ndivision of Bombay, extending inland from the southern coast of the\r\npeninsula of Kathiawar. Area, 3284 sq. m.; pop. (1901), 395,428, showing\r\na decrease of 19% in the decade, owing to famine; estimated gross\r\nrevenue, £174,000; tribute to the British government and the gaekwar of\r\nBaroda, £4200; a considerable sum is also received as tribute from minor\r\nstates in Kathiawar. The state is traversed by a railway from Rajkot, to\r\nthe seaport of Verawal. It includes the sacred mountain of Girnar and\r\nthe ruined temple of Somnath, and also the forest of Gir, the only place\r\nin India where the lion survives. Junagarh ranks as a first-class state\r\namong the many chiefships of Kathiawar, and its ruler first entered into\r\nengagements with the British in 1807. Nawab Sir Rasul Khanji, K.C.S.I.,\r\nwas born in 1858 and succeeded his brother in 1892.\r\n\r\nThe modern town of JUNAGARH (34,251), 60 m. by rail S. of Rajkot, is\r\nhandsomely built and laid out. In November 1897 the foundation-stones of\r\na hospital, library and museum were laid, and an arts college has\r\nrecently been opened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNCACEAE (rush family), in botany, a natural order of flowering plants\r\nbelonging to the series Liliiflorae of the class Monocotyledons,\r\ncontaining about two hundred species in seven genera, widely distributed\r\nin temperate and cold regions. It is well represented in Britain by the\r\ntwo genera which comprise nearly the whole order--_Juncus_, rush, and\r\n_Luzula_, woodrush. They are generally perennial herbs with a creeping\r\nunderground stem and erect, unbranched, aerial stems, bearing slender\r\nleaves which are grass-like or cylindrical or reduced to membranous\r\nsheaths. The small inconspicuous flowers are generally more or less\r\ncrowded in terminal or lateral clusters, the form of the inflorescence\r\nvarying widely according to the manner of branching and the length of\r\nthe pedicels. The flowers are hermaphrodite and regular, with the same\r\nnumber and arrangement of parts as in the order Liliaceae, from which\r\nthey differ in the inconspicuous membranous character of the perianth,\r\nthe absence of honey or smell, and the brushlike stigmas with long\r\npapillae-adaptations to wind-pollination as contrasted with the methods\r\nof pollination by insect agency, which characterize the Liliaceae.\r\nJuncaceae are, in fact, a less elaborated group of the same series as\r\nLiliaceae, but adapted to a simpler and more uniform environment than\r\nthat larger and much more highly developed family.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Juncus effusus_, common rush.\r\n\r\n  1.

Pop.\r\n(1900), 4695, of whom 545 were foreign-born and 292 were negroes;\r\n(1905), 5494; (1910), 5598. Junction City is served by the Union Pacific\r\nand the Missouri, Kansas & Texas railways. It is the commercial centre\r\nof a region in whose fertile valleys great quantities of wheat, Indian\r\ncorn, oats and hay are grown and live stock is raised, and whose uplands\r\ncontain extensive beds of limestone, which is quarried for building\r\npurposes. Excellent water-power is available and is partly utilized by\r\nflour mills. The municipality owns and operates the water-works. At the\r\nconfluence of Smoky Hill and Republican rivers and connected with the\r\ncity by an electric railway is Fort Riley, a U.S. military post, which\r\nwas established in 1853 as Camp Centre but was renamed in the same year\r\nin honour of General Bennett Riley (1787-1853); in 1887 the mounted\r\nservice school of the U.S. army was established here. Northward from the\r\npost is a rugged country over which extends a military reservation of\r\nabout 19,000 acres. Adjoining the reservation and about 5 m. N.E. of\r\nJunction City is the site of the short-lived settlement of Pawnee, where\r\nfrom the 2nd to the 6th of July 1855 the first Kansas legislature met,\r\nin a building the ruins of which still remain; the establishment of\r\nPawnee (in December 1854) was a speculative pro-slavery enterprise\r\nconducted by the commandant of Fort Riley, other army officers and\r\ncertain territorial officials, and when a government survey showed that\r\nthe site lay within the Fort Riley reservation, the settlers were\r\nordered (August 1855) to leave, and the commandant of Fort Riley was\r\ndismissed from the army; one of the charges brought against Governor A.\r\nH. Reeder was that he had favoured the enterprise. Junction City was\r\nfounded in 1857 and was chartered as a city in 1859.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNE, the sixth month in the Christian calendar, consisting of thirty\r\ndays. Ovid (_Fasti_, vi. 25) makes Juno assert that the name was\r\nexpressly given in her honour. Elsewhere (_Fasti_, vi. 87) he gives the\r\nderivation _a junioribus_, as May had been derived from _majores_, which\r\nmay be explained as in allusion either to the two months being dedicated\r\nrespectively to youth and age in general, or to the seniors and juniors\r\nof the government of Rome, the senate and the _comitia curiata_ in\r\nparticular. Others connect the term with the gentile name Junius, or\r\nwith the consulate of Junius Brutus. Probably, however, it originally\r\ndenoted the month in which crops grow to ripeness. In the old Latin\r\ncalendar June was the fourth month, and in the so-called year of Romulus\r\nit is said to have had thirty days; but at the time of the Julian reform\r\nof the calendar its days were only twenty-nine. To these Caesar added\r\nthe thirtieth. The Anglo-Saxons called June \"the dry month,\" \"midsummer\r\nmonth,\" and, in contradistinction to July, \"the earlier mild month.\" The\r\nsummer solstice occurs in June. Principal festival days in this month:\r\n11th June, St Barnabas; 24th June, Midsummer Day (Nativity of St John\r\nthe Baptist); 29th June, St Peter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNEAU, formerly HARRISBURG, a mining and trading town picturesquely\r\nsituated at the mouth of Gold Creek on the continental shore of\r\nGastineau channel, south-east Alaska, and the capital of Alaska. Pop.\r\n(1900), 1864 (450 Indians); (1910), 1644. It has a United States\r\ncustom-house and court-house. The city has fishing, manufacturing and\r\ntrading interests, but its prosperity is chiefly due to the gold mines\r\nin the adjacent Silver Bow basin, the source of Gold Creek, and the site\r\nof the great Perseverance mine, and to those on the Treadwell lode on\r\nDouglas Island, 2 m. from Juneau. Placer gold was found at the mouth of\r\nthe creek in 1879, and the city was settled in 1880 by two prospectors\r\nnamed Joseph Juneau and Richard Harris. The district was called Juneau\r\nand the camp Harrisburg by the first settlers; exploring naval officers\r\nnamed the camp Rockwell, in honour of Commander Charles Henry Rockwell,\r\nU.S.N. (b. 1840). A town meeting then adopted the name of Juneau. The\r\ntown was incorporated in 1900. In October 1906 the seat of government of\r\nAlaska was removed from Sitka to Juneau.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNG, JOHANN HEINRICH (1740-1817), best known by his assumed name of\r\nHEINRICH STILLING, German author, was born in the vlllage of Grund near\r\nHilchenbach in Westphalia on the 12th of September 1740. His father,\r\nWilhelm Jung, schoolmaster and tailor, was the son of Eberhard Jung,\r\ncharcoal-burner, and his mother was Dortchen Moritz, daughter of a poor\r\nclergyman. Jung became, by his father's desire, schoolmaster and tailor,\r\nbut found both pursuits equally wearisome. After various teaching\r\nappointments he went in 1768 with \"half a French dollar\" to study\r\nmedicine at the university of Strassburg. There he met Goethe, who\r\nintroduced him to Herder. The acquaintance with Goethe ripened into\r\nfriendship; and it was by his influence that Jung's first and best work,\r\n_Heinrich Stillings Jugend_ was written. In 1772 he settled at Elberfeld\r\nas physician and oculist, and soon became celebrated for operations in\r\ncases of cataract. Surgery, however, was not much more to his taste than\r\ntailoring or teaching; and in 1778 he was glad to accept the appointment\r\nof lecturer on \"agriculture, technology, commerce and the veterinary\r\nart\" in the newly established Kameralschule at Kaiserslautern, a post\r\nwhich he continued to hold when the school was absorbed in the\r\nuniversity of Heidelberg. In 1787 he was appointed professor of\r\neconomical, financial and statistical science in the university of\r\nMarburg. In 1803 he resigned his professorship and returned to\r\nHeidelberg, where he remained until 1806, when he received a pension\r\nfrom the grand-duke Charles Frederick of Baden, and removed to\r\nKarlsruhe, where he remained until his death on the 2nd of April 1817.\r\nHe was married three times, and left a numerous family. Of his works his\r\nautobiography _Heinrich Stillings Leben_, from which he came to be known\r\nas Stilling, is the only one now of any interest, and is the chief\r\nauthority for his life. His early novels reflect the piety of his early\r\nsurroundings.\r\n\r\n  A complete edition of his numerous works, in 14 vols. 8vo, was\r\n  published at Stuttgart in 1835-1838. There are English translations by\r\n  Sam. Jackson of the Leben (1835) and of the _Theorie der Geisterkunde_\r\n  (London, 1834, and New York, 1851); and of _Theobald, or the Fanatic_,\r\n  a religious romance, by the Rev. Sam. Schaeffer (1846). See\r\n  biographies by F. W. Bodemann (1868), J. v. Ewald (1817), Peterson\r\n  (1890).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNG BAHADUR, SIR, MAHARAJAH (1816-1877), prime minister of Nepal, was a\r\ngrand-nephew of Bhim sena Thapa (Bhim sen Thappa), the famous military\r\nminister of Nepal, who from 1804 to 1839 was _de facto_ ruler of the\r\nstate under the rani Tripuri and her successor. Bhimsena's supremacy was\r\nthreatened by the Kala Pandry, and many of his relations, including Jung\r\nBahadur, went into exile in 1838, thus escaping the cruel fate which\r\novertook Bhimsena in the following year. The Pandry leaders, who then\r\nreverted to power, were in turn assassinated in 1843, and Matabar Singh,\r\nuncle of Jung Bahadur, was created prime minister. He appointed his\r\nnephew general and chief judge, but shortly afterwards he was himself\r\nput to death. Fateh Jung thereon formed a ministry, of which Jung\r\nBahadur was made military member. In the following year, 1846, a quarrel\r\nwas fomented, in which Fateh Jung and thirty-two other chiefs were\r\nassassinated, and the rani appointed Jung Bahadur sole minister. The\r\nrani quickly changed her mind, and planned the death of her new\r\nminister, who at once appealed to the maharaja. But the plot failed. The\r\nraja and the rani wisely sought safety in India, and Jung Bahadur firmly\r\nestablished his own position by the removal of all dangerous rivals. He\r\nsucceeded so well that in January 1850 he was able to leave for a visit\r\nto England, from which he did not return to Nepal until the 6th of\r\nFebruary 1851. On his return, and frequently on subsequent dates, he\r\nfrustrated conspiracies for his assassination. The reform of the penal\r\ncode, and a desultory war with Tibet, occupied his attention until news\r\nof the Indian Mutiny reached Nepal. Jung Bahadur resisted all overtures\r\nfrom the rebels, and sent a column to Gorakpur in July 1857. In December\r\nhe furnished a force of 8000 Gurkhas, which reached Lucknow on the 11th\r\nof March 1858, and took part in the siege. The moral support of the\r\nNepalese was more valuable even than the military services rendered by\r\nthem. Jung Bahadur was made a G.C.B., and a tract of country annexed in\r\n1815 was restored to Nepal. Various frontier disputes were settled, and\r\nin 1875 Sir Jung Bahadur was on his way to England when he had a fall\r\nfrom his horse in Bombay and returned home. He received a visit from the\r\nPrince of Wales in 1876. On the 25th of February 1877 he died, having\r\nreached the age of sixty-one. Three of his widows immolated themselves\r\non his funeral pyre.     (W. L.-W.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNG-BUNZLAU (Czech, _Mladá Boleslav_), a town of Bohemia, 44 m. N.N.E.\r\nof Prague by rail. Pop. (1900), 13,479, mostly Czech. The town contains\r\nseveral old buildings of historical interest, notably the castle, built\r\ntowards the end of the 10th century, and now used as barracks. There are\r\nseveral old churches. In that of St Maria the celebrated bishop of the\r\nBohemian brethren, Johann August, was buried in 1595; but his tomb was\r\ndestroyed in 1621. The church of St Bonaventura with the convent,\r\noriginally belonging to the friars minor and later to the Bohemian\r\nbrethren, is now a Piaristic college. The church of St Wenceslaus, once\r\na convent of the brotherhood, is now used for military stores.\r\nJung-Bunzlau was built in 995, under Boleslaus II., as the seat of a\r\n_gaugraf_ or royal count. Early in the 13th century it was given the\r\nprivileges of a town and pledged to the lords of Michalovic. In the\r\nHussite wars Jung-Bunzlau adhered to the Taborites and became later the\r\nmetropolis of the Bohemian Brethren. In 1595 Bohuslav of Lobkovic sold\r\nhis rights as over-lord to the town, which was made a royal city by\r\nRudolf II. During the Thirty Years' War it was twice burned, in 1631 by\r\nthe imperialists, and in 1640 by the Swedes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNGFRAU, a well-known Swiss mountain (13,669 ft.), admirably seen from\r\nInterlaken. It rises on the frontier between the cantons of Bern and of\r\nthe Valais, and is reckoned among the peaks of the Bernese Oberland, two\r\nof which (the Finsteraarhorn, 14,026 ft., and the Aletschhorn, 13,721\r\nft.) surpass it in height. It was first ascended in 1811 by the brothers\r\nMeyer, and again in 1812 by Gottlieb Meyer (son of J. R. Meyer), in both\r\ncases by the eastern or Valais side, the foot of which (the final ascent\r\nbeing made by the 1811-1812 route) was reached in 1828 over the\r\nMönchjoch by six peasants from Grindelwald. In 1841 Principal J. D.\r\nForbes, with Agassiz, Desor and Du Châtelier, made the fourth ascent by\r\nthe 1812 route. It was not till 1865 that Sir George Young and the Rev.\r\nH. B. George succeeded in making the first ascent from the west or\r\nInterlaken side. This is a far more difficult route than that from the\r\neast, the latter being now frequently taken in the course of the summer.\r\n     (W. A. B. C.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNGLE (Sans. _jangala_), an Anglo-Indian term for a forest, a thicket,\r\na tangled wilderness. The Hindustani word means strictly waste,\r\nuncultivated ground; then such ground covered with trees or long grass;\r\nand thence again the Anglo-Indian application is to forest or other wild\r\ngrowth, rather than to the fact that it is not cultivated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNIN, an interior department of central Peru, bounded N. by Huanuco, E.\r\nby Loreto and Cuzco, S. by Huancavelica, and W. by Lima and Ancachs.\r\nPop. (1906 estimate), 305,700. It lies wholly within the Andean zone and\r\nhas an area of 23,353 sq. m. It is rich in minerals, including silver,\r\ncopper, mercury, bismuth, molybdenum, lead and coal. The Huallaga and\r\nMantaro rivers have their sources in this department, the latter in Lake\r\nJunin, or Chanchaycocha, 13,230 ft. above sea-level. The capital of\r\nJunin is Cerro de Pasco, and its two principal towns are Jauja and Tarma\r\n(pop., 1906, about 12,000 and 5000 respectively).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNIPER. The junipers, of which there are twenty-five or more species,\r\nare evergreen bushy shrubs or low columnar trees, with a more or less\r\naromatic odour, inhabiting the whole of the cold and temperate northern\r\nhemisphere, but attaining their maximum development in the Mediterranean\r\nregion, the North Atlantic islands, and the eastern United States. The\r\nleaves are usually articulated at the base, spreading, sharp-pointed and\r\nneedle-like in form, destitute of oil-glands, and arranged in\r\nalternating whorls of three; but in some the leaves are minute and\r\nscale-like, closely adhering to the branches, the apex only being free,\r\nand furnished with an oil-gland on the back. Sometimes the same plant\r\nproduces both kinds of leaves on different branches, or the young plants\r\nproduce acicular leaves, while those of the older plants are squamiform.\r\nThe male and female flowers are usually produced on separate plants. The\r\nmale flowers are developed at the ends of short lateral branches, are\r\nrounded or oblong in form, and consist of several antheriferous scales\r\nin two or three rows, each scale bearing three or six almost spherical\r\npollen-sacs on its under side. The female flower is a small bud-like\r\ncone situated at the apex of a small branch, and consists of two or\r\nthree whorls of two or three scales. The scales of the upper or middle\r\nseries each bear one or two erect ovules. The mature cone is fleshy,\r\nwith the succulent scales fused together and forming the fruit-like\r\nstructure known to the older botanists as the _galbulus_, or berry of\r\nthe juniper. The berries are red or purple in colour, varying in size\r\nfrom that of a pea to a nut. They thus differ considerably from the\r\ncones of other members of the order Coniferae, of _Gymnosperms_ (q.v.),\r\nto which the junipers belong. The seeds are usually three in number,\r\nsometimes fewer (1), rarely more (8), and have the surface near the\r\nmiddle or base marked with large glands containing oil. The genus occurs\r\nin a fossil state, four species having been described from rocks of\r\nTertiary age.\r\n\r\nThe genus is divided into three sections, _Sabina_, _Oxycedrus_ and\r\n_Caryocedrus_. _Juniperus Sabina_ is the savin, abundant on the\r\nmountains of central Europe, an irregularly spreading much-branched\r\nshrub with scale-like glandular leaves, and emitting a disagreeable\r\nodour when bruised. The plant is poisonous, acting as a powerful local\r\nand general stimulant, diaphoretic, emmenagogue and anthelmintic; it was\r\nformerly employed both internally and externally. The oil of savin is\r\nnow occasionally used criminally as an abortifacient. _J. bermudiana_, a\r\ntree about 40 or 50 ft. in height, yields a fragrant red wood, which was\r\nused for the manufacture of \"cedar\" pencils. The tree is now very scarce\r\nin Bermuda, and the \"red cedar,\" _J. virginiana_, of North America is\r\nemployed instead for pencils and cigar-boxes. The red cedar is abundant\r\nin some parts of the United States and in Virginia is a tree 50 ft. in\r\nheight. It is very widely distributed from the Great Lakes to Florida\r\nand round the Gulf of Mexico, and extends as far west as the Rocky\r\nMountains and beyond to Vancouver Island. The wood is applied to many\r\nuses in the United States. The fine red fragrant heart-wood takes a high\r\npolish, and is much used in cabinet-work and inlaying, but the small\r\nsize of the planks prevents its more extended use. The galls produced at\r\nthe ends of the branches have been used in medicine, and the wood yields\r\ncedar-camphor and oil of cedar-wood. _J. thurifera_ is the incense\r\njuniper of Spain and Portugal, and _J. phoenicea_ (_J. lycia_) from the\r\nMediterranean district is stated by Loudon to be burned as incense.\r\n\r\n_J. communis_, the common juniper (see fig.), and several other species,\r\nbelong to the section _Oxycedrus_. The common juniper is a very widely\r\ndistributed plant, occurring in the whole of northern Europe, central\r\nand northern Asia to Kamchatka, and east and west North America. It\r\ngrows at considerable elevations in southern Europe, in the Alps,\r\nApennines, Pyrenees and Sierra Nevada (4000 to 8000 ft.). It also grows\r\nin Asia Minor, Persia, and at great elevations on the Himalayas. In\r\nGreat Britain it is usually a shrub with spreading branches, less\r\nfrequently a low tree. In former times the juniper seems to have been a\r\nvery well-known plant, the name occurring almost unaltered in many\r\nlanguages. The Lat. _juniperus_, probably formed from _juni_--crude form\r\nof _juvenis_, fresh, young, and _parere_, to produce, is represented by\r\nFr. _genièvre_, Sp. _enebro_, Ital. _ginepito_, &c. The dialectical\r\nnames, chiefly in European languages, were collected by Prince L. L.\r\nBonaparte, and published in the _Academy_ (July 17, 1880, No. 428, p.\r\n45). The common juniper is official in the British pharmacopoeia and in\r\nthat of the United States, yielding the oil of juniper, a powerful\r\ndiuretic, distilled from the unripe fruits. This oil is closely allied\r\nin composition to oil of turpentine and is given in doses of a half to\r\nthree minims. The _Spiritus juniperi_ of the British pharmacopoeia is\r\ngiven in doses up to one drachm. Much safer and more powerful diuretics\r\nare now in use. The wood is very aromatic and is used for ornamental\r\npurposes. In Lapland the bark is made into ropes. The fruits are used\r\nfor flavouring gin (a name derived from _juniper_, through Fr.\r\n_genièvre_); and in some parts of France a kind of beer called\r\n_genévrette_ was made from them by the peasants. _J. Oxycedrus_, from\r\nthe Mediterranean district and Madeira, yields cedar-oil which is\r\nofficial in most of the European pharmacopoeias, but not in that of\r\nBritain. This oil is largely used by microscopists in what is known as\r\nthe \"oil-immersion lens.\"\r\n\r\nThe third section, _Caryocedrus_, consists of a single species, _J.\r\ndrupacea_ of Asia Minor. The fruits are large and edible: they are known\r\nin the East by the name _habhel_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (From Bentley and Trimen's _Medicinal Plants_, by\r\npermission of J. & A.

Male catkin.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNIUS, the pseudonym of a writer who contributed a series of letters to\r\nthe London _Public Advertiser_, from the 21st of January 1769 to the\r\n21st of January 1772. The signature had been already used by him in a\r\nletter of the 21st of November 1768, which he did not include in his\r\ncollection of the _Letters of Junius_ published in 1772. The name was\r\nchosen in all probability because he had already signed \"Lucius\" and\r\n\"Brutus,\" and wished to exhaust the name of Lucius Junius Brutus the\r\nRoman patriot. Whoever the writer was, he wrote under other pseudonyms\r\nbefore, during and after the period between January 1769 and January\r\n1772. He acknowledged that he had written as \"Philo-Junius,\" and there\r\nis evidence that he was identical with \"Veteran,\" \"Nemesis\" and other\r\nanonymous correspondents of the _Public Advertiser_. There is a marked\r\ndistinction between the \"letters of Junius\" and his so-called\r\nmiscellaneous letters. The second deal with a variety of subjects, some\r\nof a purely personal character, as for instance the alleged injustice of\r\nViscount Barrington the secretary at war to the officials of his\r\ndepartment. But the \"letters of Junius\" had a definite object--to\r\ndiscredit the ministry of the duke of Grafton. This administration had\r\nbeen formed in October 1768, when the earl of Chatham was compelled by\r\nill health to retire from office, and was a reconstruction of his\r\ncabinet of July 1766. Junius fought for the return to power of Chatham,\r\nwho had recovered and was not on good terms with his successors. He\r\ncommunicated with Chatham, with George Grenville, with Wilkes, all\r\nenemies of the duke of Grafton, and also with Henry Sampson Woodfall,\r\nprinter and part owner of the _Public Advertiser_. This private\r\ncorrespondence has been preserved. It is written in the disguised hand\r\nused by Junius.\r\n\r\nThe letters are of interest on three grounds--their political\r\nsignificance, their style, and the mystery which long surrounded their\r\nauthorship. As political writings they possess no intrinsic value.\r\nJunius was wholly destitute of insight, and of the power to disentangle,\r\ndefine and advocate principles. The matter of his letters is always\r\ninvective. He began by a general attack on the ministry for their\r\npersonal immorality or meanness. An ill-judged defence of one of the\r\nbody--the marquess of Granby, commander-in-chief--volunteered by Sir\r\nWilliam Draper, gave him an easy victory over a vulnerable opponent. He\r\nthen went on to pour acrimonious abuse on Grafton, on the duke of\r\nBedford, on King George III. himself in the letter of the 19th of\r\nDecember 1769, and ended with a most malignant and ignorant assault on\r\nLord Chief Justice Mansfield. Several of his accusations were shown to\r\nbe unfounded. The practical effect of the letters was insignificant.\r\nThey were noticed and talked about. They provoked anger and retorts. But\r\nthe letter to the king aroused indignation, and though Grafton's\r\nadministration fell in January 1770, it was succeeded by the long-lived\r\ncabinet of Lord North. Junius confessed himself beaten, in his private\r\nletter to Woodfall of the 19th of January 1773. He had materially\r\ncontributed to his own defeat by his brutal violence. He sinned indeed\r\nin a large company. The employment of personal abuse had been habitual\r\nin English political controversy for generations, and in the 18th\r\ncentury there was a strong taste for satire. Latin literature, which was\r\nnot only studied but imitated, supplied the inspiration and the models,\r\nin the satires of Juvenal, and the speeches of Cicero against Verres and\r\nCatiline.\r\n\r\nIf, however, Junius was doing what others did, he did it better than\r\nanybody else--a fact which sufficiently explains his rapid popularity.\r\nHis superiority lay in his style. Here also he was by no means original,\r\nand he was unequal. There are passages in his writings which can be best\r\ndescribed in the words which Burke applied to another writer: \"A mere\r\nmixture of vinegar and water, at once vapid and sour.\" But at his best\r\nJunius attains to a high degree of artificial elegance and vigour. He\r\nshows the influence of Bolingbroke, of Swift, and above all of Tacitus,\r\nwho appears to have been his favourite author. The imitation is never\r\nslavish. Junius adapts, and does not only repeat. The white heat of his\r\nmalignity animates the whole. No single sentence will show the quality\r\nof a style which produces its effect by persistence and repetition, but\r\nsuch a typical passage as follows displays at once the method and the\r\nspirit. It is taken from Letter XLIX. to the duke of Grafton, June 22,\r\n1771:--\r\n\r\n  \"The profound respect I bear to the gracious prince who governs this\r\n  country with no less honour to himself than satisfaction to his\r\n  subjects, and who restores you to your rank under his standard, will\r\n  save you from a multitude of reproaches. The attention I should have\r\n  paid to your failings is involuntarily attracted to the hand which\r\n  rewards them; and though I am not so partial to the royal judgment as\r\n  to affirm that the favour of a king can remove mountains of infamy, it\r\n  serves to lessen at least, for undoubtedly it divides, the burden.\r\n  While I remember how much is due to his sacred character, I cannot,\r\n  with any decent appearance of propriety, call you the meanest and the\r\n  basest fellow in the kingdom. I protest, my Lord, I do not think you\r\n  so. You will have a dangerous rival in that kind of fame to which you\r\n  have hitherto so happily directed your ambition, as long as there is\r\n  one man living who thinks you worthy of his confidence, and fit to be\r\n  trusted with any share in his government.... With any other prince,\r\n  the shameful desertion of him in the midst of that distress, which you\r\n  alone had created, in the very crisis of danger, when he fancied he\r\n  saw the throne already surrounded by men of virtue and abilities,\r\n  would have outweighed the memory of your former services. But his\r\n  majesty is full of justice, and understands the doctrine of\r\n  compensations; he remembers with gratitude how soon you had\r\n  accommodated your morals to the necessities of his service, how\r\n  cheerfully you had abandoned the engagements of private friendship,\r\n  and renounced the most solemn professions to the public. The\r\n  sacrifice of Lord Chatham was not lost on him. Even the cowardice and\r\n  perfidy of deserting him may have done you no disservice in his\r\n  esteem. The instance was painful, but the principle might please.\"\r\n\r\nWhat is artificial and stilted in this style did not offend the would-be\r\nclassic taste of the 18th century, and does not now conceal the fact\r\nthat the laboriously arranged words, and artfully counterbalanced\r\nclauses, convey a venomous hate and scorn.\r\n\r\nThe pre-established harmony between Junius and his readers accounts for\r\nthe rapidity of his success, and for the importance attributed to him by\r\nBurke and Johnson, far better writers than himself. Before 1772 there\r\nappeared at least twelve unauthorized republications of his letters,\r\nmade by speculative printers. In that year he revised the collection\r\nnamed \"_Junius: Stat nominis umbra_,\" with a dedication to the English\r\npeople and a preface. Other independent editions followed in quick\r\nsuccession. In 1801 one was published with annotations by Robert Heron.\r\nIn 1806 another appeared with notes by John Almon. The first new edition\r\nof real importance was issued by the Woodfall family in 1812. It\r\ncontained the correspondence of Junius with H. S. Woodfall, a selection\r\nof the miscellaneous letters attributed to Junius, facsimiles of his\r\nhandwriting, and notes by Dr Mason Good. Curiosity as to the mystery of\r\nthe authorship began to replace political and literary interest in the\r\nwritings. Junius himself had been early aware of the advantage he\r\nsecured by concealment. \"The mystery of Junius increases his importance\"\r\nis his confession in a letter to Wilkes dated the 18th of September\r\n1771. The calculation was a sound one. For two generations after the\r\nappearance of the letter of the 21st of January 1769, speculations as to\r\nthe authorship of Junius were rife, and discussion had hardly ceased in\r\n1910. Joseph Parkes, author with Herman Merivale of the _Memoirs of Sir\r\nPhilip Francis_ (1867), gives a list of more than forty persons who had\r\nbeen supposed to be Junius. They are: Edmund Burke, Lord George\r\nSackville, Lord Chatham, Colonel Barré, Hugh Macaulay Boyd, Dr Butler,\r\nJohn Wilkes, Lord Chesterfield, Henry Flood, William Burke, Gibbon, W.\r\nE. Hamilton, Charles Lloyd, Charles Lee (general in the American War of\r\nIndependence), John Roberts, George Grenville, James Grenville, Lord\r\nTemple, Duke of Portland, William Greatrakes, Richard Glover, Sir\r\nWilliam Jones, James Hollis, Laughlin Maclean, Philip Rosenhagen, Horne\r\nTooke, John Kent, Henry Grattan, Daniel Wray, Horace Walpole, Alexander\r\nWedderburn (Lord Loughborough), Dunning (Lord Ashburton), Lieut.-General\r\nSir R. Rich, Dr Philip Francis, a \"junto\" or committee of writers who\r\nused a common name, De Lolme, Mrs Catherine Macaulay (1733-91), Sir\r\nPhilip Francis, Lord Littleton, Wolfram Cornwall and Gov. Thomas\r\nPownall. In the great majority of cases the attribution is based on\r\nnothing more than a vague guess. Edmund Burke denied that he could have\r\nwritten the letters of Junius if he would, or would have written them if\r\nhe could. Grattan pointed out that he was young when they appeared. More\r\nplausible claims, such as those made for Lord Temple and Lord George\r\nSackville, could not stand the test of examination. Indeed after 1816\r\nthe question was not so much \"Who wrote Junius?\" as \"Was Junius Sir\r\nPhilip Francis, or some undiscoverable man?\" In that year John Taylor\r\nwas led by a careful study of Woodfall's edition of 1812 to publish _The\r\nidentity of Junius with a distinguished living character established_,\r\nin which he claimed the letters for Sir Philip Francis. He had at first\r\nbeen inclined to attribute them to Sir Philip's father, Dr Francis, the\r\nauthor of translations of Horace and Demosthenes. Taylor applied to Sir\r\nPhilip, who did not die till 1818, for leave to publish, and received\r\nfrom him answers which to an unwary person might appear to constitute\r\ndenials of the authorship, but were in fact evasions.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for believing that Sir Philip Francis (q.v.) was Junius are\r\nvery strong. His evasions were only to be expected. Several of the men\r\nhe attacked lived nearly as long as himself, the sons of others were\r\nconspicuous in society, and King George III. survived him. Sir Philip,\r\nwho had held office, who had been decorated, and who in his later years\r\nwas ambitious to obtain the governor-generalship of India, dared not\r\nconfess that he was Junius. The similarity of his handwriting to the\r\ndisguised hand used by the writer of the letters is very close. If Sir\r\nPhilip Francis did, as his family maintain, address a copy of verses to\r\na Miss Giles in the handwriting of Junius (and the evidence that he did\r\nis weighty) there can be no further question as to the identity of the\r\ntwo. The similarity of Junius and Francis in regard to their opinions,\r\ntheir likes and dislikes, their knowledge and their known movements,\r\namount, apart from the handwriting, almost to proof. It is certain that\r\nmany felons have been condemned on circumstantial evidence less\r\ncomplete. The opposition to his claim is based on such assertions as\r\nthat his known handwriting was inferior to the feigned hand of Junius,\r\nand that no man can make a disguised hand better than his own. But the\r\nfirst assertion is unfounded, and the second is a mere expression of\r\nopinion. It is also said that Francis must have been guilty of baseness\r\nif he wrote Junius, but if that explains why he did not avow the\r\nauthorship it can be shown to constitute a moral impossibility only by\r\nan examination of his life.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--The best edition of the _Letters of Junius_, properly so\r\n  called, with the _Miscellaneous Letters_, is that of J. Ward (1854).\r\n  The most valuable contributions to the controversy as to the\r\n  authorship are: _The Handwriting of Junius investigated by Charles\r\n  Chabot, expert, with preface and collateral evidence by the Hon. E.\r\n  Twisleton_ (1871); _Memoirs of Sir Philip Francis, K.C.B._, by Parkes\r\n  and Merivale (1867); _Junius Revealed by his Surviving Grandson_, by\r\n  H. R. Francis (1894); _The Francis Letters_, edited by Beata Francis\r\n  and Eliza Keary, with a note on the Junius controversy by C. F. Keary\r\n  (1901); and \"Francis, Sir Philip,\" by Sir Leslie Stephen, in _Dict. of\r\n  Nat. Biog._ The case for those who decline to accept the claim of Sir\r\n  Philip Francis is stated by C. W. Dilke, _Papers of a Critic_ (1875),\r\n  and Abraham Hayward, _More about Junius, Franciscan Theory Unsound_\r\n  (1868).     (D. H.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNIUS, FRANZ (in French, François du Jon), the name of two Huguenot\r\nscholars.\r\n\r\n(1) FRANZ JUNIUS (1545-1602) was born at Bourges in France on the 1st of\r\nMay 1545. He had studied law for two years under Hugo Donellus\r\n(1527-1591) when he was given a place in the retinue of the French\r\nambassador to Constantinople, but before he reached Lyons the ambassador\r\nhad departed. Junius found ample consolation in the opportunities for\r\nstudy at the gymnasium at Lyons. A religious tumult warned him back to\r\nBourges, where he was cured of certain rationalistic principles that he\r\nhad imbibed at Lyons, and he determined to enter the reformed church. He\r\nwent in 1562 to study at Geneva, where he was reduced to the direst\r\npoverty by the failure of remittances from home, owing to civil war in\r\nFrance. He would accept only the barest sustenance from a humble friend\r\nwho had himself been a protégé of Junius's family at Bourges, and his\r\nhealth was permanently injured. The long-expected remittance from home\r\nwas closely followed by the news of the brutal murder of his father by a\r\nCatholic fanatic at Issoudun; and Junius resolved to remain at Geneva,\r\nwhere his reputation enabled him to live by teaching. In 1565, however,\r\nhe was appointed minister of the Walloon church at Antwerp. His foreign\r\nbirth excluded him from the privileges of the native reformed pastors,\r\nand exposed him to persecution. Several times he barely escaped arrest,\r\nand finally, after spending six months in preaching at Limburg, he was\r\nforced to retire to Heidelberg in 1567. There he was welcomed by the\r\nelector Frederick II., and temporarily settled in charge of the Walloon\r\nchurch at Schönau; but in 1568 his patron sent him as chaplain with\r\nPrince William of Orange in his unfortunate expedition to the\r\nNetherlands. Junius escaped as soon as he could from that post, and\r\nreturning to his church remained there till 1573. From 1573 till 1578 he\r\nwas at Heidelberg, assisting Emmanuel Tremellius (1510-1580), whose\r\ndaughter he married, in his Latin version of the Old Testament\r\n(Frankfort, 1579); in 1581 he was appointed to the chair of divinity at\r\nHeidelberg. Thence he was taken to France by the duke of Bouillon, and\r\nafter an interview with Henry IV. was sent again to Germany on a\r\nmission. As he was returning to France he was named professor of\r\ntheology at Leiden, where he died on the 13th of October 1602.\r\n\r\n  He was a voluminous writer on theological subjects, and translated and\r\n  composed many exegetical works. He is best known from his own edition\r\n  of the Latin Old Testament, slightly altered from the former joint\r\n  edition, and with a version of the New Testament added (Geneva, 1590;\r\n  Hanover, 1624). The _Opera Theologica Francisci Junii Biturigis_ were\r\n  published at Geneva (2 vols., 1613), to which is prefixed his\r\n  autobiography, written about 1592 (new ed., edited by Abraham Kuypers,\r\n  1882 seq.). The autobiography had been published at Leiden (1595), and\r\n  is reprinted in the _Miscellanea Groningana_, vol. i., along with a\r\n  list of the author's other writings.\r\n\r\n(2) FRANZ JUNIUS (1589-1677), son of the above, was born at Heidelberg,\r\nand brought up at Leiden. His attention was diverted from military to\r\ntheological studies by the peace of 1609 between Spain and the\r\nNetherlands. In 1617 he became pastor at Hillegondsberg, but in 1620\r\nwent to England, where he became librarian to Thomas Howard, earl of\r\nArundel, and tutor to his son. He remained in England thirty years,\r\ndevoting himself to the study of Anglo-Saxon, and afterwards of the\r\ncognate old Teutonic languages. His work, intrinsically valuable, is\r\nimportant as having aroused interest in a frequently neglected subject.\r\nIn 1651 he returned to Holland; and for two years lived in Friesland in\r\norder to study the old dialect. In 1675 he returned to England, and\r\nduring the next year resided in Oxford; in 1677 he went to live at\r\nWindsor with his nephew, Isaac Vossius, in whose house he died on the\r\n19th of November 1677. He was buried at Windsor in St George's Chapel.\r\n\r\n  He was pre-eminently a student. He published _De pictura veterum_\r\n  (1637) (in English by the author, 1638; enlarged and improved edition,\r\n  edited by J. G. Graevius, who prefixed a life of Junius, with a\r\n  catalogue of architects, painters, &c., and their works, Rotterdam,\r\n  1694); _Observationes in Willerami Abbatis francicam paraphrasin\r\n  cantici canticorum_ (Amsterdam, 1655); _Annotationes in harmoniam\r\n  latino-francicam quatuor evangelistarum, latine a Tatiano confectam_\r\n  (Amsterdam, 1655); _Caedmonis monachi paraphrasis poetica geneseos_\r\n  (Amsterdam, 1655) (see criticism under CAEDMON); _Quatuor D.N.I.C.\r\n  evangeliorum versiones perantiquae duae, gothica scilicet et\r\n  anglo-saxonica_ (Dort, 2 vols., 1665) (the Gothic version in this book\r\n  Junius transcribed from the Silver Codex of Ulfilas; the Anglo-Saxon\r\n  version is from an edition by Thomas Marshall, whose notes to both\r\n  versions are given, and a Gothic glossary by Junius); _Etymologicum\r\n  anglicanum_, edited by Edward Lye, and preceded by a life of Junius\r\n  and George Hickes's Anglo-Saxon grammar (Oxford, 1743) (its results\r\n  require careful verification in the light of modern research). His\r\n  rich collection of ancient MSS., edited and annotated by him, Junius\r\n  bequeathed to the university of Oxford. Graevius gives a list of them;\r\n  the most important are a version of the _Ormulum_, the version of\r\n  Caedmon, and 9 volumes containing _Glossarium v. linguarum\r\n  septentrionalium_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNK. (1) (Through Port. _junco_, adapted from Javanese _djong_, or\r\nMalayan _adjong_, ship), the name of the native sailing vessel, common\r\nto the far eastern seas, and especially used by the Chinese and\r\nJavanese. It is a flat-bottomed, high-sterned vessel with square bows\r\nand masts carrying lug-sails, often made of matting. (2) A nautical term\r\nfor small pieces of disused rope or cable, cut up to make fenders,\r\noakum, &c., hence applied colloquially by sailors to the salt beef and\r\npork used on board ship. The word is of doubtful origin, but may be\r\nconnected with \"junk\" (Lat. _juncus_), a reed, or rush. This word is now\r\nobsolete except as applied to a form of surgical appliance, used as a\r\nsupport in cases of fracture where immediate setting is impossible, and\r\nconsisting of a shaped pillow or cushion stuffed with straw or\r\nhorsehair, formerly with rushes or reeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNKER, WILHELM (1840-1892), German explorer of Africa, was born at\r\nMoscow on the 6th of April 1840. He studied medicine at Dorpat,\r\nGöttingen, Berlin and Prague, but did not practise for long. After a\r\nseries of short journeys to Iceland, Tunis and Lower Egypt, he remained\r\nalmost continuously in eastern Equatorial Africa from 1875 to 1886,\r\nmaking first Khartum and afterwards Lado the base of his expeditions,\r\nJunker was a leisurely traveller and a careful observer; his main object\r\nwas to study the peoples with whom he came into contact, and to collect\r\nspecimens of plants and animals, and the result of his investigations in\r\nthese particulars is given in his _Reisen in Afrika_ (3 vols., Vienna,\r\n1889-1891), a work of high merit. An English translation by A. H. Keane\r\nwas published in 1890-1892. Perhaps the greatest service he rendered to\r\ngeographical science was his investigation of the Nile-Congo watershed,\r\nwhen he successfully combated Georg Schweinfurth's hydrographical\r\ntheories and established the identity of the Welle and Ubangi. The\r\nMahdist rising prevented his return to Europe through the Sudan, as he\r\nhad planned to do, in 1884, and an expedition, fitted out in 1885 by his\r\nbrother in St Petersburg, failed to reach him. Junker then determined to\r\ngo south. Leaving Wadelai on the 2nd of January 1886 he travelled by way\r\nof Uganda and Tabora and reached Zanzibar in December 1886. In 1887 he\r\nreceived the gold medal of the Royal Geographical Society. As an\r\nexplorer Junker is entitled to high rank, his ethnographical\r\nobservations in the Niam-Niam (Azandeh) country being especially\r\nvaluable. He died at St Petersburg on the 13th of February 1892.\r\n\r\n  See the biographical notice by E. G. Ravenstein in _Proceedings of the\r\n  Royal Geographical Society_ (1892), pp. 185-187.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNKET, a dish of milk curdled by rennet, served with clotted cream and\r\nflavoured with nutmeg, which is particularly associated in England with\r\nDevonshire and Cornwall. The word is of somewhat obscure history. It\r\nappears to come through O. Fr. _jonquette_, a rush-basket, from Lat.\r\n_juncus_, rush. In Norman dialect this word is used of a cream cheese.\r\nThe commonly accepted origin is that it refers to the rush-basket on\r\nwhich such cream cheeses or curds were served. _Juncade_ appears in\r\nRabelais, and is explained by Cotgrave as \"spoon-meat, rose-water and\r\nsugar.\" Nicholas Udall (in his translation of Erasmus's _Apophthegms_,\r\n1542) speaks of \"marchepaines or wafers with other like junkerie.\" The\r\nword \"junket\" is also used for a festivity or picnic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNO, the chief Roman and Latin goddess, and the special object of\r\nworship by women at all the critical moments of life. The etymology of\r\nthe name is not certain, but it is usually taken as a shortened form of\r\n_Jovino_, answering to _Jovis_, from a root _div_, shining. Under Greek\r\ninfluence Juno was early identified with the Greek Hera, with whose cult\r\nand characteristics she has much in common; thus the Juno with whom we\r\nare familiar in Latin literature is not the true Roman deity. In the\r\n_Aeneid_, for example, her policy is antagonistic to the plans of\r\nJupiter for the conquest of Latium and the future greatness of Rome;\r\nthough in the fourth _Eclogue_, as Lucina, she appears in her proper\r\nrôle as assisting at childbirth. It was under Greek influence again that\r\nshe became the wife of Jupiter, the mother of Mars; the true Roman had\r\nno such personal interest in his deities as to invent family relations\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\nThat Juno was especially a deity of women, and represents in a sense the\r\nfemale principle of life, is seen in the fact that as every man had his\r\n_genius_, so every woman had her Juno; and the goddess herself may have\r\nbeen a development of this conception. The various forms of her cult all\r\nshow her in close connexion with women. As Juno Lucina she was invoked\r\nin childbirth, and on the 1st of March, the old Roman New Year's day,\r\nthe matrons met and made offerings at her temple in a grove on the\r\nEsquiline; hence the day was known as the _Matronalia_. As _Caprotina_\r\nshe was especially worshipped by female slaves on the 7th of July\r\n(_Nonae Caprotinae_); as _Sospita_ she was invoked all over Latium as\r\nthe saviour of women in their perils, and later as the saviour of the\r\nstate; and under a number of other titles, _Cinxia_, _Unxia_, _Pronuba_,\r\n&c., we find her taking a leading part in the ritual of marriage. Her\r\nreal or supposed connexion with the moon is explained by the alleged\r\ninfluence of the moon on the lives of women; thus she became the deity\r\nof the Kalends, or day of the new moon, when the _regina sacrorum_\r\noffered a lamb to her in the _regia_, and her husband the _rex_ made\r\nknown to the people the day on which the Nones would fall. Thus she is\r\nbrought into close relation with Janus, who also was worshipped on the\r\nKalends by the _rex sacrorum_, and it may be that in the oldest Roman\r\nreligion these two were more closely connected than Juno and Jupiter.\r\nBut in historical times she was associated with Jupiter in the great\r\ntemple on the Capitoline hill as Juno _Regina_, the queen of all Junones\r\nor queen of heaven, as Jupiter there was _Optimus Maximus_ (see\r\nJUPITER), and under the same title she was enticed from Veii after its\r\ncapture in 392 B.C., and settled in a temple on the Aventine. Thus\r\nexalted above all other female deities, she was prepared for that\r\nidentification with Hera which was alluded to above. That she was in\r\nsome sense a deity of light seems certain; as Lucina, e.g., she\r\nintroduced new-born infants \"in luminis oras.\"\r\n\r\n  See Roscher's article \"Juno\" in his Lexicon of Mythology, and his\r\n  earlier treatise on Juno and Hera; Wissowa, _Religion und Kultus der\r\n  Römer_, 113 foll.; also a fresh discussion by Walter Otto in\r\n  _Philologus_ for 1905 (p. 161 foll.).     (W. W. F.*)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNOT, ANDOCHE, DUKE OF ABRABANTES (1771-1813), French general, was born\r\nat Bussy-le-Grand (Côte d'Or), on the 23rd of October 1771. He went to\r\nschool at Chatillon, and was known among his comrades as a blustering\r\nbut lovable creature, with a pugnacious disposition. He was studying law\r\nin Paris at the outbreak of the Revolution and joined a volunteer\r\nbattalion. He distinguished himself by his valour in the first year of\r\nthe Revolutionary wars, and came under the special notice of Napoleon\r\nBonaparte during the siege of Toulon, while serving as his secretary. It\r\nis related that as he was taking down a despatch, a shell burst hard by\r\nand covered the paper with sand, whereupon he exclaimed, \"Bien! nous\r\nn'avions pas de sable pour sécher l'encre! en voici!\" He remained the\r\nfaithful companion of his chief during the latter's temporary disgrace,\r\nand went with him to Italy as aide-de-camp. He distinguished himself so\r\nmuch at the battle of Millesimo that he was selected to carry back the\r\ncaptured colours to Paris; returning to Italy he went through the\r\ncampaign with honour, but was badly wounded in the head at Lonato. Many\r\nrash incidents in his career may be traced to this wound, from which he\r\nnever completely recovered. During the expedition to Egypt he became a\r\ngeneral of brigade. His devotion to Bonaparte involved him in a duel\r\nwith General Lanusse, in which he was again wounded. He had to be left\r\nin Egypt to recover, and in crossing to France was captured by English\r\ncruisers. On his return to France he was made commandant of Paris, and\r\nafterwards promoted general of division. It was at this time that he\r\nmarried Laure Permon (see JUNOT, LAURE). He next served at Arras in\r\ncommand of the grenadiers of the army destined for the invasion of\r\nEngland, and made some alterations in the equipment of the troops which\r\nreceived the praise of the emperor. It was, however, a bitter\r\nmortification that he was not appointed a marshal of France when he\r\nreceived the grand cross of the legion of honour. He was made\r\ncolonel-general of hussars instead and sent as ambassador to Lisbon, his\r\nentry into which city resembled a royal progress. But he was so restless\r\nand dissatisfied in the Portuguese capital that he set out, without\r\nleave, for the army of Napoleon, with which he took part in the battle\r\nof Austerlitz, behaving with his usual courage and zeal. But he soon\r\ngave fresh offence. Although his early devotion was never forgotten by\r\nthe emperor, his uncertain temper and want of self-control made it\r\ndangerous to employ him at court or headquarters, and he was sent to\r\nParma to put down an insurrection and to be out of the way. In 1806 he\r\nwas recalled and became governor of Paris. His extravagance and\r\nprodigality shocked the government, and some rumours of an intrigue with\r\na lady of the imperial family--it is said Pauline Bonaparte--made it\r\ndesirable again to send him away. He was therefore appointed to lead an\r\ninvading force into Portugal. For the first time Junot had a great task\r\nto perform, and only his own resources to fall back upon for its\r\nachievement. Early in November 1807 he set out from Salamanca, crossed\r\nthe mountains of Beira, rallied his wearied forces at Abrantes, and,\r\nwith 1500 men, dashed upon Lisbon, in order, if possible, to seize the\r\nPortuguese fleet, which had, however, just sailed away with the regent\r\nand court to Brazil. The whole movement only took a month; it was\r\nundoubtedly bold and well-conducted, and Junot was made duke of Abrantes\r\nand invested with the governorship of Portugal. But administration was\r\nhis weak point. He was not a civil governor, but a _sabreur_, brave,\r\ntruculent, and also dissipated and rapacious, though in the last respect\r\nhe was far from being the worst offender amongst the French generals in\r\nSpain. His hold on Portugal was never supported by a really adequate\r\nforce, and his own conduct, which resembled that of an eastern monarch,\r\ndid nothing to consolidate his conquest. After Wellesley encountered him\r\nat Vimiera (see Peninsular War) he was obliged to conclude the so-called\r\nconvention of Cintra, and to withdraw from Portugal with all his forces.\r\nNapoleon was furious, but, as he said, was spared the necessity of\r\nsending his old friend before a court martial by the fact that the\r\nEnglish put their own generals on their trial. Junot was sent back to\r\nSpain, where, in 1810-1811, acting under Masséna, he was once more\r\nseriously wounded. His last campaign was made in Russia, and he received\r\nmore than a just share of discredit for it. Napoleon next appointed him\r\nto govern Illyria. But Junot's mind had become deranged under the weight\r\nof his misfortunes, and on the 29th of July 1813, at Montbard, he threw\r\nhimself from a window in a fit of insanity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNOT, LAURE, DUCHESS OF ABRANTES (1783-1834), wife of the preceding,\r\nwas born at Montpellier. She was the daughter of Mme. Permon, to whom\r\nduring her widowhood the young Bonaparte made an offer of marriage--such\r\nat least is the version presented by the daughter in her celebrated\r\n_Memoirs_. The Permon family, after various vicissitudes, settled at\r\nParis, and Bonaparte certainly frequented their house a good deal after\r\nthe downfall of the Jacobin party in Thermidor 1794. Mlle. Permon was\r\nmarried to Junot early in the consulate, and at once entered eagerly\r\ninto all the gaieties of Paris, and became noted for her beauty, her\r\ncaustic wit, and her extravagance. The first consul nicknamed her\r\n_petite peste_, but treated her and Junot with the utmost generosity, a\r\nfact which did not restrain her sarcasms and slanders in her portrayal\r\nof him in her _Memoirs_. During Junot's diplomatic mission to Lisbon,\r\nhis wife displayed her prodigality so that on his return to Paris in\r\n1806 he was burdened with debts, which his own intrigues did not lessen.\r\nShe joined him again at Lisbon after he had entered that city as\r\nconqueror at the close of 1807; but even the presents and spoils won at\r\nLisbon did not satisfy her demands; she accompanied Junot through part\r\nof the Peninsular War. On her return to France she displeased the\r\nemperor by her vivacious remarks and by receiving guests whom he\r\ndisliked. The mental malady of Junot thereafter threatened her with\r\nruin; this perhaps explains why she took some part in the intrigues for\r\nbringing back the Bourbons in 1814. She did not side with Napoleon\r\nduring the Hundred Days. After 1815 she spent most of her time at Rome\r\namidst artistic society, which she enlivened with her sprightly\r\nconverse. She also compiled her spirited but somewhat spiteful\r\n_Memoirs_, which were published at Paris in 1831-1834 in 18 volumes.\r\nMany editions have since appeared.\r\n\r\n  Of her other books the most noteworthy are _Histoires contemporaines_\r\n  (2 vols., 1835); _Scènes de la vie espagnole_ (2 vols., 1836);\r\n  _Histoire des salons de Paris_ (6 vols., 1837-1838); _Souvenirs d'une\r\n  ambassade et d'un séjour en Espagne et en Portugal, de 1808 à 1811_ (2\r\n  vols., 1837).     (J. Hl. R.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNTA (from _juntar_, to join), a Spanish word meaning (1) any meeting\r\nfor a common purpose; (2) a committee; (3) an administrative council or\r\nboard. The original meaning is now rather lost in the two derivative\r\nsignifications. The Spaniards have even begun to make use of the\r\nbarbarism _métin_, corrupted from the English \"meeting.\" The word\r\n_junta_ has always been and still is used in the other senses. Some of\r\nthe boards by which the Spanish administration was conducted under the\r\nHabsburg and the earlier Bourbon kings were styled _juntas_. The\r\nsuperior governing body of the Inquisition was the _junta suprema_. The\r\nprovincial committees formed to organize resistance to Napoleon's\r\ninvasion in 1808 were so called, and so was the general committee chosen\r\nfrom among them to represent the nation. In the War of Independence\r\n(1808-1814), and in all subsequent civil wars or revolutionary\r\ndisturbances in Spain or Spanish America, the local executive bodies,\r\nelected, or in some cases self-chosen, to appoint officers, raise money\r\nand soldiers, look after the wounded, and discharge the functions of an\r\nadministration, have been known as juntas.\r\n\r\nThe form \"Junto,\" a corruption due to other Spanish words ending in\r\n-_o_, came into use in English in the 17th century, often in a\r\ndisparaging sense, of a party united for a political purpose, a faction\r\nor cabal; it was particularly applied to the advisers of Charles I., to\r\nthe Rump under Cromwell, and to the leading members of the great Whig\r\nhouses who controlled the government in the reigns of William III. and\r\nAnne.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUPITER, the chief deity of the Roman state. The great and constantly\r\ngrowing influence exerted from a very early period on Rome by the\r\nsuperior civilization of Greece not only caused a modification of the\r\nRoman god on the analogy of Zeus, the supreme deity of the Greeks, but\r\nled the Latin writers to identify the one with the other, and to\r\nattribute to Jupiter myths and family relations which were purely Greek\r\nand never belonged to the real Roman religion. The Jupiter of actual\r\nworship was a Roman god; the Jupiter of Latin literature was more than\r\nhalf Greek. This identification was facilitated by the community of\r\ncharacter which really belonged to Jupiter and Zeus as the Roman and\r\nGreek developments of a common original conception of the god of the\r\nlight and the heaven.\r\n\r\nThat this was the original idea of Jupiter, not only in Rome, but among\r\nall Italian peoples, admits of no doubt. The earliest form of his name\r\nwas _Diovis pater_, or _Diespiter_, and his special priest was the\r\nflamen dialis; all these words point to a root _div_, shining, and the\r\nconnexion with _dies_, day, is obvious (cf. JUNO). One of his most\r\nancient epithets is _Lucetius_, the light-bringer; and later literature\r\nhas preserved the same idea in such phrases as _sub Jove_, under the\r\nopen sky. All days of the full moon (_idus_) were sacred to him; all\r\nemanations from the sky were due to him and in the oldest form of\r\nreligious thought were probably believed to be manifestations of the god\r\nhimself. As Jupiter _Elicius_ he was propitiated, with a peculiar\r\nritual, to send rain in time of drought; as Jupiter _Fulgur_ he had an\r\naltar in the Campus Martius, and all places struck by lightning were\r\nmade his property and guarded from the profane by a circular wall. The\r\nvintage, which needs especially the light and heat of the sun, was under\r\nhis particular care, and in the festivals connected with it (_Vinalia\r\nurbana_) and _Meditrinalia_, he was the deity invoked, and his flamen\r\nthe priest employed. Throughout Italy we find him worshipped on the\r\nsummits of hills, where nothing intervened between earth and heaven, and\r\nwhere all the phenomena of the sky could be conveniently observed. Thus\r\non the Alban hill south of Rome was an ancient seat of his worship as\r\nJupiter _Latiaris_, which was the centre of the league of thirty Latin\r\ncities of which Rome was originally an ordinary member. At Rome itself\r\nit is on the Capitoline hill that we find his oldest temple, described\r\nby Livy (i. 10); here we have a tradition of his sacred tree, the oak,\r\ncommon to the worship both of Zeus and Jupiter, and here too was kept\r\nthe _lapis silex_, perhaps a celt, believed to have been a thunderbolt,\r\nwhich was used symbolically by the fetiales when officially declaring\r\nwar and making treaties on behalf of the Roman state. Hence the curious\r\nform of oath, _Jovem lapident jurare_, used both in public and private\r\nlife at Rome.\r\n\r\nIn this oldest Jupiter of the Latins and Romans, the god of the light\r\nand the heaven, and the god invoked in taking the most solemn oaths, we\r\nmay undoubtedly see not only the great protecting deity of the race, but\r\none, and perhaps the only one, whose worship embodies a distinct moral\r\nconception. He is specially concerned with oaths, treaties and leagues,\r\nand it was in the presence of his priest that the most ancient and\r\nsacred form of marriage, _confarreatio_, took place. The lesser deities,\r\nDius Fidius and Fides, were probably originally identical with him, and\r\nonly gained a separate existence in course of time by a process familiar\r\nto students of ancient religion. This connexion with the conscience,\r\nwith the sense of obligation and right dealing, was never quite lost\r\nthroughout Roman history. In Virgil's great poem, though Jupiter is in\r\nmany ways as much Greek as Roman, he is still the great protecting deity\r\nwho keeps the hero in the path of duty (_pietas_) towards gods, state\r\nand family.\r\n\r\nBut this aspect of Jupiter gained a new force and meaning at the close\r\nof the monarchy with the building of the famous temple on the Capitol,\r\nof which the foundations are still to be seen. It was dedicated to\r\nJupiter _Optimus Maximus_, i.e. the best and greatest of all the\r\nJupiters, and with him were associated Juno and Minerva, in a fashion\r\nwhich clearly indicates a Graeco-Etruscan origin; for the combination of\r\nthree deities in one temple was foreign to the ancient Roman religion,\r\nwhile it is found both in Greece and Etruria. This temple was built on a\r\nscale of magnificence quite unknown to primitive Rome, and was beyond\r\ndoubt the work of Etruscan architects employed, we may presume, by the\r\nTarquinii. Its three _cellae_ contained the statues of the three\r\ndeities, with Jupiter in the middle holding his thunderbolt.\r\nHenceforward it was the centre of the religious life of the state, and\r\nsymbolized its unity and strength. Its dedication festival fell on the\r\n13th of September, on which day the consuls originally succeeded to\r\noffice; accompanied by the senate and other magistrates and priests, and\r\nin fulfilment of a vow made by their predecessors, they offered to the\r\ngreat god a white heifer, his favourite sacrifice, and after rendering\r\nthanks for the preservation of the state during the past year, made the\r\nsame vow as that by which they themselves had been bound. Then followed\r\nthe _epulum Jovis_ or feast of Jupiter, in which the three deities seem\r\nto have been visibly present in the form of their statues, Jupiter\r\nhaving a couch and each goddess a _sella_, and shared the meal with\r\nsenate and magistrates. In later times this day became the central point\r\nof the great Roman games (_ludi Romani_), originally games vowed in\r\nhonour of the god if he brought a war to a successful issue. When a\r\nvictorious army returned home, it was to this temple that the triumphal\r\nprocession passed, and the triumph of which we hear so often in Roman\r\nhistory may be taken as a religious ceremonial in honour of Jupiter. The\r\ngeneral was dressed and painted to resemble the statue of Jupiter\r\nhimself, and was drawn on a gilded chariot by four white horses through\r\nthe Porta Triumphalis to the Capitol, where he offered a solemn\r\nsacrifice to the god, and laid on his knees the victor's laurels (see\r\nTRIUMPH).\r\n\r\nThroughout the period of the Republic the great god of the Capitol in\r\nhis temple looking down on the Forum continued to overshadow all other\r\nworships as the one in which the whole state was concerned, in all its\r\nlength and breadth, rather than any one gens or family. Under Augustus\r\nand the new monarchy it is sometimes said that the Capitoline worship\r\nsuffered to some extent an eclipse (J. B. Carter, _The Religion of\r\nNuma_, p. 160 seq.); and it is true that as it was the policy of\r\nAugustus to identify the state with the interests of his own family, he\r\ndid what was feasible to direct the attention of the people to the\r\nworships in which he and his family were specially concerned; thus his\r\ntemple of Apollo on the Palatine, and that of Mars Ultor in the Forum\r\nAugusti, took over a few of the prerogatives of the cult on the Capitol.\r\nBut Augustus was far too shrewd to attempt to oust Jupiter Optimus\r\nMaximus from his paramount position; and he became the protecting deity\r\nof the reigning emperor as representing the state, as he had been the\r\nprotecting deity of the free republic. His worship spread over the whole\r\nempire; it is probable that every city had its temple to the three\r\ndeities of the Roman Capitol, and the fact that the Romans chose the\r\nname of Jupiter in almost every case, by which to indicate the chief\r\ndeity of the subject peoples, proves that they continued to regard him,\r\nso long as his worship existed at all, as the god whom they themselves\r\nlooked upon as greatest.\r\n\r\n  See ZEUS, ROMAN RELIGION. Excellent accounts of Jupiter may be found\r\n  in Roscher's _Mythological Lexicon_, and in Wissowa's _Religion und\r\n  Kultus der Römer_ (p. 100 seq.).     (W. M. Ra.; W. W. F.*)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUPITER, in astronomy, the largest planet of the solar system; his size\r\nis so great that it exceeds the collective mass of all the others in the\r\nproportion of 5 to 2. He travels in his orbit at a mean distance from\r\nthe sun exceeding that of the earth 5.2 times, or 483,000,000 miles. The\r\neccentricity of this orbit is considerable, amounting to 0.048, so that\r\nhis maximum and minimum distances are 504,000,000 and 462,000,000 miles\r\nrespectively. When in opposition and at his mean distance, he is\r\nsituated 390,000,000 miles from the earth. His orbit is inclined about\r\n1° 18´ 40´´ to the ecliptic. His sidereal revolution is completed in\r\n4332.585 days or 11 years 314.9 days, and his synodical period, or the\r\nmean interval separating his returns to opposition, amounts to 398.87\r\ndays. His real polar and equatorial diameters measure 84,570 and 90,190\r\nmiles respectively, so that the mean is 87,380 miles. His apparent\r\ndiameter (equatorial) as seen from the earth varies from about 32´´,\r\nwhen in conjunction with the sun, to 50´´ in opposition to that\r\nluminary. The oblateness, or compression, of his globe amounts to about\r\n1/16; his volume exceeds that of the earth 1390 times, while his mass is\r\nabout 300 times greater. These values are believed to be as accurate as\r\nthe best modern determinations allow, but there are some differences\r\namongst various observers and absolute exactness cannot be obtained.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of telescopic construction early in the 17th century and\r\nthe practical use of the telescope by Galileo and others greatly\r\nenriched our knowledge of Jupiter and his system. Four of the satellites\r\nwere detected in 1610, but the dark bands or belts on the globe of the\r\nplanet do not appear to have been noticed until twenty years later.\r\nThough Galileo first sighted the satellites and perseveringly studied\r\nthe Jovian orb, he failed to distinguish the belts, and we have to\r\nconclude either that these features were unusually faint at the period\r\nof his observations, or that his telescopes were insufficiently powerful\r\nto render them visible. The belts were first recognized by Nicolas\r\nZucchi and Daniel Bartoli on the 17th of May 1630. They were seen also\r\nby Francesco Fontana in the same and immediately succeeding years, and\r\nby other observers of about the same period, including Zuppi, Giovanni\r\nBattista Riccioli and Francesco Maria Grimaldi. Improvements in\r\ntelescopes were quickly introduced, and between 1655 and 1666 C.\r\nHuygens, R. Hooke and J. D. Cassini made more effective observations.\r\nHooke discovered a large dark spot in the planet's southern hemisphere\r\non the 19th of May 1664, and from this object Cassini determined the\r\nrotation period, in 1665 and later years, as 9 hours 56 minutes.\r\n\r\nThe belts, spots and irregular markings on Jupiter have now been\r\nassiduously studied during nearly three centuries. These markings are\r\nextremely variable in their tones, tints and relative velocities, and\r\nthere is little reason to doubt that they are atmospheric formations\r\nfloating above the surface of the planet in a series of different\r\ncurrents. Certain of the markings appear to be fairly durable, though\r\ntheir rates of motion exhibit considerable anomalies and prove that they\r\nmust be quite detached from the actual sphere of Jupiter. At various\r\ntimes determinations of the rotation period were made as follows:--\r\n\r\n  _Date._   _Observer._        _Period._         _Place of Spot._\r\n\r\n  1672    J. D.

According to the researches of\r\nStanley Williams the rates of motion for different latitudes of the\r\nplanet are approximately as under:--\r\n\r\n   _Latitude._         _Rotation Period._\r\n\r\n  +85° to +28°     9 h. 55 m. 37.5 s.\r\n  +28° to +24°     9 h. 54½ m. to 9 h. 56½ m.\r\n  +24° to +20°     9 h. 48 m. to 9 h. 49½ m.\r\n  +20° to +10°     9 h. 55 m. 33.9 s.\r\n  +10° to -12°     9 h. 50 m. 20 s.\r\n  -12° to -18°     9 h. 55 m. 40 s.\r\n  -18° to -37°     9 h. 55 m. 18.1 s.\r\n  -37° to -55°     9 h. 55 m. 5 s.\r\n\r\nW. F. Denning gives the following relative periods for the years 1898 to\r\n1905:--\r\n\r\n   _Latitude._      _Rotation Period._\r\n\r\n  N.N. temperate   9 h. 55 m. 41.5 s.\r\n  N. temperate     9 h. 55 m. 53.8 s.\r\n  N. tropical      9 h. 55 m. 30 s.\r\n  Equatorial       9 h. 50 m. 27 s.\r\n  S. temperate     9 h. 55 m. 19.5 s.\r\n  S.S. temperate   9 h. 55 m. 7 s.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Inverted disk of Jupiter, showing the different\r\ncurrents and their rates of rotation.]\r\n\r\nThe above are the mean periods derived from a large number of markings.\r\nThe bay or hollow in the great southern equatorial belt north of the red\r\nspot has perhaps been observed for a longer period than any other\r\nfeature on Jupiter except the red spot itself. H. Schwabe saw the hollow\r\nin the belt on the 5th of September 1831 and on many subsequent dates.\r\nThe rotation period of this object during the seventy years to the 5th\r\nof September 1901 was 9 h. 55 m. 36 s. from 61,813 rotations. Since 1901\r\nthe mean period has been 9 h. 55 m. 40 s., but it has fluctuated between\r\n9 h. 55 m. 38 s. and 9 h. 55 m. 42 s. The motion of the various features\r\nis not therefore dependent upon their latitude, though at the equator\r\nthe rate seems swifter as a rule than in other zones. But exceptions\r\noccur, for in 1880 some spots appeared in about 23° N. which rotated in\r\n9 h. 48 m. though in the region immediately N. of this the spot motion\r\nis ordinarily the slowest of all and averages 9 h. 55 m. 53.8 s. (from\r\ntwenty determinations). These differences of speed remind us of the\r\nsun-spots and their proper motions. The solar envelope, however, appears\r\nto show a pretty regular retardation towards the poles, for according to\r\nGustav Spörer's formula, while the equatorial period is 25 d. 2 h. 15 m.\r\nthe latitudes 46° N. and S. give a period of 28 d. 15 h. 0 m.\r\n\r\nThe Jovian currents flow in a due east and west direction as though\r\nmainly influenced by the swift rotatory movement of the globe, and\r\nexhibit little sign of deviation either to N. or S. These currents do\r\nnot blend and pass gradually into each other, but seem to be definitely\r\nbounded and controlled by separate, phenomena well capable of preserving\r\ntheir individuality. Occasionally, it is true, there have been slanting\r\nbelts on Jupiter (a prominent example occurred in the spring of 1861),\r\nas though the materials were evolved with some force in a polar\r\ndirection, but these oblique formations have usually spread out in\r\nlongitude and ultimately formed bands parallel with the equator. The\r\nlongitudinal currents do not individually present us with an equable\r\nrate of motion. In fact they display some curious irregularities, the\r\nspots carried along in them apparently oscillating to and fro without\r\nany reference to fixed periods or cyclical variations. Thus the\r\nequatorial current in 1880 moved at the rate of 9 h. 50 m. 6 s. whereas\r\nin 1905 it was 9 h. 50 m. 33 s. The red spot in the S. tropical zone\r\ngave 9 h. 55 m. 34 s. in 1879-1880, whereas during 1900-1908 it has\r\nvaried a little on either side of 9 h. 55 m. 40.6 s. Clearly therefore\r\nno fixed period of rotation can be applied for any spot since it is\r\nsubject to drifts E. or W. and these drifts sometimes come into\r\noperation suddenly, and may be either temporary or durable. Between 1878\r\nand 1900 the red spot in the planet's S. hemisphere showed a continuous\r\nretardation of speed.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that in speaking of the rotation of these\r\nmarkings, we are simply alluding to the irregularities in the vaporous\r\nenvelope of Jupiter. The rotation of the planet itself is another matter\r\nand its value is not yet exactly known, though it is probably little\r\ndifferent from that of the markings, and especially from those of the\r\nmost durable character, which indicate a period of about 9 h. 56 m. We\r\nnever discern the actual landscape of Jupiter or any of the individual\r\nforms really diversifying it.\r\n\r\nPossibly the red spot which became so striking an object in 1878, and\r\nwhich still remains faintly visible on the planet, is the same feature\r\nas that discovered by R. Hooke in 1664 and watched by Cassini in\r\nfollowing years. It was situated in approximately the same latitude of\r\nthe planet and appears to have been hidden temporarily during several\r\nperiods up to 1713. But the lack of fairly continuous observations of\r\nthis particular marking makes its identity with the present spot\r\nextremely doubtful. The latter was seen by W. R. Dawes in 1857, by Sir\r\nW. Huggins in 1858, by J. Baxendell in 1859, by Lord Rosse and R.\r\nCopeland in 1873, by H. C. Russell in 1876-1877, and in later years it\r\nhas formed an object of general observation. In fact it may safely be\r\nsaid that no planetary marking has ever aroused such widespread interest\r\nand attracted such frequent observation as the great red spot on\r\nJupiter.\r\n\r\nThe slight inclination of the equator of this planet to the plane of his\r\norbit suggests that he experiences few seasonal changes. From the\r\nconditions we are, in fact, led to expect a prevailing calm in his\r\natmosphere, the more so from the circumstance that the amount of the\r\nsun's heat poured upon each square mile of it is (on the average) less\r\nthan the 27th part of that received by each square mile of the earth's\r\nsurface. Moreover, the seasons of Jupiter have nearly twelve times the\r\nduration of ours, so that it would be naturally expected that changes in\r\nhis atmosphere produced by solar action take place with extreme\r\nslowness. But this is very far from being the case. Telescopes reveal\r\nthe indications of rapid changes and extensive disturbances in the\r\naspect and material forming the belts. New spots covering large areas\r\nfrequently appear and as frequently decay and vanish, implying an\r\nagitated condition of the Jovian atmosphere, and leading us to admit the\r\noperation of causes much more active than the heating influence of the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--Jupiter, 1903, July 10, 2.50 a.m.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--Jupiter, 1906, April 15, 5.50 p.m.]\r\n\r\nWhen we institute a comparison between Jupiter and the earth on the\r\nbasis that the atmosphere of the former planet bears the same relation\r\nto his mass as the atmosphere of the earth bears to her mass, we find\r\nthat a state of things must prevail on Jupiter very dissimilar to that\r\naffecting our own globe. The density of the Jovian atmosphere we should\r\nexpect to be fully six times as great as the density of our air at\r\nsea-level, while it would be comparatively shallow. But the telescopic\r\naspect of Jupiter apparently negatives the latter supposition. The belts\r\nand spots grow faint as they approach the limb, and disappear as they\r\nnear the edge of the disk, thus indicating a dense and deep atmosphere.\r\nR. A. Proctor considered that the observed features suggested inherent\r\nheat, and adopted this conclusion as best explaining the surface\r\nphenomena of the planet. He regarded Jupiter as belonging, on account of\r\nhis immense size, to a different class of bodies from the earth, and was\r\nled to believe that there existed greater analogy between Jupiter and\r\nthe sun than between Jupiter and the earth. Thus the density of the sun,\r\nlike that of Jupiter, is small compared with the earth's; in fact, the\r\nmean density of the sun is almost identical with that of Jupiter, and\r\nthe belts of the latter planet may be much more aptly compared with the\r\nspot zones of the sun than with the trade zones of the earth.\r\n\r\nIn support of the theory of inherent heat on Jupiter it has been said\r\nthat his albedo (or light reflected from his surface) is much greater\r\nthan the amount would be were his surface similar to that of the moon,\r\nMercury or Mars, and the reasoning has been applied to the large outer\r\nplanets, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, as well as to Jupiter. The average\r\nreflecting capacity of the moon and five outer planets would seem to be\r\n(on the assumption that they possess no inherent light) as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Moon   0.1736     Jupiter  0.6238     Uranus   0.6400\r\n  Mars   0.2672     Saturn   0.4981     Neptune  0.4848\r\n\r\nThese values were considered to support the view that the four larger\r\nand more distant orbs shine partly by inherent lustre, and the more so\r\nas spectroscopic analysis indicates that they are each involved in a\r\ndeep vapour-laden atmosphere. But certain observations furnish a\r\ncontradiction to Proctor's views. The absolute extinction of the\r\nsatellites, even in the most powerful telescopes, while in the shadow of\r\nJupiter, shows that they cannot receive sufficient light from their\r\nprimary to render them visible, and the darkness of the shadows of the\r\nsatellites when projected on the planet's disk proves that the latter\r\ncannot be self-luminous except in an insensible degree. It is also to be\r\nremarked that, were it only moderately self-luminous, the colour of the\r\nlight which it sends to us would be red, such light being at first\r\nemitted from a heated body when its temperature is raised. Possibly,\r\nhowever, the great red spot, when the colouring was intense in 1878 and\r\nseveral following years, may have represented an opening in the Jovian\r\natmosphere, and the ruddy belts may be extensive rifts in the same\r\nenvelope. If Jupiter's actual globe emitted a good deal of heat and\r\nlight we should probably distinguish little of it, owing to the\r\nobscuring vapours floating above the surface. Venus reflects relatively\r\nmore light than Jupiter, and there is little doubt that the albedo of a\r\nplanet is dependent upon atmospheric characteristics, and is in no case\r\na direct indication of inherent light and heat.\r\n\r\nThe colouring of the belts appears to be due to seasonal variations, for\r\nStanley Williams has shown that their changes have a cycle of twelve\r\nyears, and correspond as nearly as possible with a sidereal revolution\r\nof Jupiter. The variations are of such character that the two great\r\nequatorial belts are alternately affected; when the S. equatorial belt\r\ndisplays maximum redness the N. equatorial is at a minimum and vice\r\nversa.\r\n\r\nThe most plausible hypothesis with regard to the red spot is that it is\r\nof the nature of an island floating upon a liquid surface, though its\r\ngreat duration does not favour this idea. But it is an open question\r\nwhether the belts of Jupiter indicate a liquid or gaseous condition of\r\nthe visible surface. The difficulty in the way of the liquid hypothesis\r\nis the great difference in the times of rotation between the equatorial\r\nportions of the planet and the spots in temperate latitudes. The latter\r\nusually rotate in periods between 9 h. 55 m. and 9 h. 56 m., while the\r\nequatorial markings make a revolution in about five minutes less, 9 h.\r\n50 m. to 9 h. 51 m. The difference amounts to 7.5° in a terrestrial day\r\nand proves that an equatorial spot will circulate right round the\r\nenormous sphere of Jupiter (circumference 283,000 m.) in 48 days. The\r\nmotion is equivalent to about 6000 m. per day and 250 m. per hour.\r\n     (W. F. D.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Satellites of Jupiter._\r\n\r\nJupiter is attended by eight known satellites, resolvable as regards\r\ntheir visibility into two widely different classes. Four satellites were\r\ndiscovered by Galileo and were the only ones known until 1892. In\r\nSeptember of that year E. E. Barnard, at the Lick Observatory,\r\ndiscovered a fifth extremely faint satellite, performing a revolution in\r\nsomewhat less than twelve hours. In 1904 two yet fainter satellites, far\r\noutside the other five, were photographically discovered by C. D.\r\nPerrine at the Lick Observatory. The eighth satellite was discovered by\r\nP. J. Melotte of Greenwich on the 28th of February 1908. It is of the\r\n17th magnitude and appears to be very distant from Jupiter; a\r\nre-observation on the 16th of January 1909 proved it to be retrograde,\r\nand to have a very eccentric orbit. These bodies are usually numbered in\r\nthe order of their discovery, the nearest to the sun being V. In\r\napparent brightness each of the four Galilean satellites may be roughly\r\nclassed as of the sixth magnitude; they would therefore be visible to a\r\nkeen eye if the brilliancy of the planet did not obscure them. Some\r\nobservers profess to have seen one or more of these bodies with the\r\nnaked eye notwithstanding this drawback, but the evidence can scarcely\r\nbe regarded as conclusive. It does not however seem unlikely that the\r\nthird, which is the brightest, might be visible when in conjunction with\r\none of the others.\r\n\r\nUnder good conditions and sufficient telescopic power the satellites are\r\nvisible as disks, and not mere points of light. Measures of the apparent\r\ndiameter of objects so faint are, however, difficult and uncertain. The\r\nresults for the Galilean satellites range between 0´´.9 and 1´´.5,\r\ncorresponding to diameters of between 3000 and 5000 kilometres. The\r\nsmallest is therefore about the size of our moon. Satellite I. has been\r\nfound to exhibit marked variations in its brightness and aspect, but the\r\nlaw governing them has not been satisfactorily worked out. It seems\r\nprobable that one hemisphere of this satellite is brighter than the\r\nother, or that there is a large dark region upon it. A revolution on its\r\naxis corresponding with that of the orbital revolution around the planet\r\nhas also been suspected, but is not yet established. Variations of light\r\nsomewhat similar, but less in amount, have been noticed in the second\r\nand third satellites.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting and easily observed phenomena of these bodies are\r\ntheir eclipses and their transits across the disk of Jupiter. The four\r\ninner satellites pass through the shadow of Jupiter at every superior\r\nconjunction, and across his disk at every inferior conjunction. The\r\nouter Galilean satellite does the same when the conjunctions are not too\r\nnear the line of nodes of the satellites' orbit. When most distant from\r\nthe nodes, the satellites pass above or below the shadow and below or\r\nabove the disk. These phenomena for the four Galilean satellites are\r\npredicted in the nautical almanacs.\r\n\r\nWhen one of the four Galilean satellites is in transit across the disk\r\nof Jupiter it can generally be seen projected on the face of the planet.\r\nIt is commonly brighter than Jupiter when it first enters upon the limb\r\nbut sometimes darker near the centre of the disk. This is owing to the\r\nfact that the planet is much darker at the limb. During these transits\r\nthe shadow of the satellites can also be seen projected on the planet as\r\na dark point.\r\n\r\n  The theories of the motion of these bodies form one of the more\r\n  interesting problems of celestial mechanics. Owing to the great\r\n  ellipticity of Jupiter, growing out of his rapid rotation, the\r\n  influence of this ellipticity upon the motions of the five inner\r\n  satellites is much greater than that of the sun, or of the satellites\r\n  on each other. The inclination of the orbits to the equator of Jupiter\r\n  is quite small and almost constant, and the motion of each node is\r\n  nearly uniform around the plane of the planet's equator.\r\n\r\n  The most marked feature of these bodies is a relation between the mean\r\n  longitudes of Satellites I., II. and III. The mean longitude of I.\r\n  plus twice that of III. minus three times that of II. is constantly\r\n  near to 180°. It follows that the same relations subsist among the\r\n  mean motions. The cause of this was pointed out by Laplace. If we put\r\n  L1 L2 and L3 for the mean longitudes, and define an angle U as\r\n  follows:--\r\n\r\n    U = L1 - 3 L2 + 2 L3.\r\n\r\n  it was shown mathematically by Laplace that if the longitudes and mean\r\n  motions were such that the angle U differed a little from 180°, there\r\n  was a minute residual force arising from the mutual actions of the\r\n  several bodies tending to bring this angle towards the value 180°.\r\n  Consequently, if the mean motions were such that this angle increased\r\n  only with great slowness, it would after a certain period tend back\r\n  toward the value 180°, and then beyond it, exactly as a pendulum drawn\r\n  out of the perpendicular oscillates towards and beyond it. Thus an\r\n  oscillation would be engendered in virtue of which the angle would\r\n  oscillate very slowly on each side of the central value. Computation\r\n  of the mean longitude from observations has indicated that the angle\r\n  does differ from 180°, but it is not certain whether this deviation is\r\n  greater than the possible result of the errors of observation. However\r\n  this may be, the existence of the libration, and its period if it does\r\n  exist, are still unknown.\r\n\r\n  The following are the principal elements of the orbits of the five\r\n  inner satellites, arranged in the order of distance from Jupiter. The\r\n  mean longitudes are for 1891, 20th of October, G.M.T., and are\r\n  referred to the equinox of the epoch, 1891, 2nd of October:--\r\n\r\n    +--------------------+-----------+--------------+--------------+-----------+-------------+\r\n    |      Satellite     |     V.    |      I.      |      II.     |    III.   |     IV.     |\r\n    +--------------------+-----------+--------------+--------------+-----------+-------------+\r\n    | Mean Long.         |  264°.29  |  313°.7193   |   39°.1187   | 171°.2448 |  62°.2000   |\r\n    | Synodic Period     |11 h. 58 m.|1 d. 18 h. .48|  3d. 13h. .30|7d. 3h. .99|16d. 18m. .09|\r\n    | Mean Distance      |106,400 m. |  260,000 m.  |  414,000 m.  | 661,000 m.| 1,162,000 m.|\r\n    | Mass ÷ Mass of Jup.|    (?)    |  .00002831   |  .00002324   | .00008125 |  .00002149  |\r\n    | Stellar Mag.       |    13     |     6.0      |      6.1     |    5.6    |     6.6     |\r\n    +--------------------+-----------+--------------+--------------+-----------+-------------+\r\n\r\n  The following numbers relating to the planet itself have been supplied\r\n  mostly by Professor Hermann Struve.\r\n\r\n                                                 Filar Mic.

They appear to be immigrants,\r\nand tradition places their home in the south; they now occupy a district\r\nof the Bahr-el-Ghazal between the Bongo and Dinka tribes. Of a reddish\r\nblack colour, fairer than the Dinka, they are well proportioned, with\r\nthe hair short. Tattooing is not common, but when found is similar to\r\nthat of the Dinka; they pierce the ears and nose, and in addition to the\r\nornaments found among the Dinka (q.v.) wear a series of iron rings on\r\nthe forearm covering it from wrist to elbow. They are mainly\r\nagricultural, but hunt and fish to a considerable extent; they are also\r\nskilful smiths, smelting their own iron, of which they supply quantities\r\nto the Dinka. They are a prosperous tribe and in consequence spinsters\r\nare unknown among them. Their chief currency is spears and hoe-blades,\r\nand cowrie shells are used in the purchase of wives. Their chief weapons\r\nare spears and bows.\r\n\r\n  See G. Schweinfurth, _The Heart of Africa: Travels 1868-1871_, trans.\r\n  G. E. E. Frewer (2nd ed., 1874); W. Junker, _Travels in Africa_ (Eng.\r\n  ed., 1890-1892).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJURA, a department of France, on the eastern frontier, formed from the\r\nsouthern portion of the old province of Franche-Comté. It is bounded N\r\nby the department of Haute-Saône, N.E. by Doubs, E. by Switzerland, S.\r\nby Ain, and W. by Saône-et-Loire and Côte d'Or. Pop. (1906), 257,725.\r\nArea, 1951 sq. m. Jura comprises four distinct zones with a general\r\ndirection from north to south. In the S.E. lie high eastern chains of\r\nthe central Jura, containing the Crêt Pela (4915 ft.), the highest point\r\nin the department. More to the west there is a chain of forest-clad\r\nplateaus bordered on the E. by the river Ain. Westward of these runs a\r\nrange of hills, the slopes of which are covered with vineyards. The\r\nnorth-west region of the department is occupied by a plain which\r\nincludes the fertile Finage, the northern portion of the Bresse, and is\r\ntraversed by the Doubs and its left affluent the Loue, between which\r\nlies the fine forest of Chaux, 76 sq. m. in area. Jura falls almost\r\nwholly within the basin of the Rhone. Besides those mentioned, the chief\r\nrivers are the Valouze and the Bienne, which water the south of the\r\ndepartment. There are several lakes, the largest of which is that of\r\nChalin, about 12 m. E. of Lons-le-Saunier. The climate is, on the whole,\r\ncold; the temperature is subject to sudden and violent changes, and\r\namong the mountains winter sometimes lingers for eight months. The\r\nrainfall is much above the average of France.\r\n\r\nJura is an agricultural department: wheat, oats, maize and barley are\r\nthe chief cereals, the culture of potatoes and rape being also of\r\nimportance. Vines are grown mainly in the cantons of Arbois, Poligny,\r\nSalins and Voiteur. Woodlands occupy about a fifth of the area: the oak,\r\nhornbeam and beech, and, in the mountains, the spruce and fir, are the\r\nprincipal varieties. Natural pasture is abundant on the mountains.\r\nForests, gorges, torrents and cascades are characteristic features of\r\nthe scenery. Its minerals include iron and salt and there are\r\nstone-quarries. Peat is also worked. Lons-le-Saunier and Salins have\r\nmineral springs. Industries include the manufacture of Gruyère,\r\nSeptmoncel and other cheeses (made in co-operative cheese factories or\r\n_fruitières_), metal founding and forging, saw-milling, flour-milling,\r\nthe cutting of precious stones (at Septmoncel and elsewhere), the\r\nmanufacture of nails, tools and other iron goods, paper, leather,\r\nbrier-pipes, toys and fancy wooden-ware and basket-work. The making of\r\nclocks, watches, spectacles and measures, which are largely exported,\r\nemploys much labour in and around Morez. Imports consist of grain,\r\ncattle, wine, leaf-copper, horn, ivory, fancy-wood; exports of\r\nmanufactured articles, wine, cheese, stone, timber and salt. The\r\ndepartment is served chiefly by the Paris-Lyon-Méditerranée railway, the\r\nmain line from Paris to Neuchâtel traversing its northern region. The\r\ncanal from the Rhone to the Rhine, which utilizes the channel of the\r\nDoubs over portions of its course, traverses it for 25 m.\r\nLons-le-Saunier is the chief town of Jura, which embraces four\r\narrondissements named after the towns of Lons-le-Saunier, Dôle, Poligny\r\nand St Claude, with 32 cantons and 584 communes. The department forms\r\nthe diocese of St Claude and part of the ecclesiastical province of\r\nBesançon; it comes within the region of the VIIth army corps and the\r\neducational circumscription (académie) of Besançon, where is its court\r\nof appeal. Lons-le-Saunier, Dôle, Arbois, Poligny, St Claude and Salins,\r\nthe more noteworthy towns, receive separate notices. At\r\nBaume-les-Messieurs, 8 m. N.E. of Lons-le-Saunier, there is an ancient\r\nabbey with a fine church of the 12th century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJURA (\"deer island\"), an island of the inner Hebrides, the fourth\r\nlargest of the group, on the west coast of Argyllshire, Scotland. Pop.\r\n(1901), 560. On the N. it is separated from the island of Scarba by the\r\nwhirlpool of Corrievreckan, caused by the rush of the tides, often\r\nrunning over 13 m. an hour, and sometimes accelerated by gales, on the\r\nE. from the mainland by the sound of Jura, and on the S. and S.W. from\r\nIslay by the sound of Islay. At Kinuachdrach there is a ferry to Aird in\r\nLorne, in Argyllshire, and at Faolin there is a ferry to Port Askaig in\r\nIslay. Its area is about 160 sq. m., the greatest length is about 27 m.,\r\nand the breadth varies from 2 m. to 8 m. The surface is mountainous and\r\nthe island is the most rugged of the Hebrides. A chain of hills\r\nculminating in the Paps of Jura--Beinn-an-Oir (2571 ft.) and Beinn\r\nChaolais (2407 ft.)--runs the whole length of the island, interrupted\r\nonly by Tarbert loch, an arm of the sea, which forms an indentation\r\nnearly 6 m. deep and almost cuts the island in two. Jura derived its\r\nname from the red deer which once abounded on it. Cattle and sheep are\r\nraised; oats, barley and potatoes are cultivated along the eastern\r\nshore, and there is some fishing. Granite is quarried and silicious\r\nsand, employed in glass-making is found. The parish of Jura comprises\r\nthe islands of Balnahua, Fladda, Garvelloch, Jura, Lunga, Scarba and\r\nSkervuile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJURA, a range which may be roughly described as the block of mountains\r\nrising between the Rhine and the Rhone, and forming the frontier between\r\nFrance and Switzerland. The gorges by which these two rivers force their\r\nway to the plains cut off the Jura from the Swabian and Franconian\r\nranges to the north and those of Dauphiné to the south. But in very\r\nearly days, before these gorges had been carved out, there were no\r\nopenings in the Jura at all, and even now its three chief rivers--the\r\nDoubs, the Loue and the Ain--flow down the western slope, which is both\r\nmuch longer and but half as steep as the eastern. Some geographers\r\nextend the name Jura to the Swabian and Franconian ranges between the\r\nDanube and the Neckar and the Main; but, though these are similar in\r\npoint of composition and direction to the range to the south, it is most\r\nconvenient to limit the name to the mountain ridges lying between France\r\nand Switzerland, and this narrower sense will be adopted here.\r\n\r\nThe Jura has been aptly described as a huge plateau about 156 m. long\r\nand 38 m. broad, hewn into an oblong shape, and raised by internal\r\nforces to an average height of from 1950 to 2600 ft. above the\r\nsurrounding plains. The shock by which it was raised and the vibration\r\ncaused by the elevation of the great chain of the Alps, produced many\r\ntransverse gorges or \"cluses,\" while on the plateaus between these\r\nsubaerial agencies have exercised their ordinary influence.\r\n\r\nGeologically the Jura Mountains belong to the Alpine system; and the\r\nsame forces which crumpled and tore the strata of the one produced the\r\nfolds and faults in the other. Both chains owe their origin to the mass\r\nof crystalline and unyielding rock which forms the central plateau of\r\nFrance, the Vosges and the Black Forest, and which, between the Vosges\r\nand the central plateau, lies at no great depth beneath the surface.\r\nAgainst this mass the more yielding strata which lay to the south and\r\nwest were crushed and folded, and the Alps and the Jura were carved from\r\nthe ridges which were raised. But the folding decreases in intensity\r\ntowards the north; the folding in the Alps is much more violent than the\r\nfolding in the Jura, and in the Jura itself the folding is most marked\r\nalong its southern flanks.\r\n\r\nThe Jura is composed chiefly of Jurassic rocks--it is from this chain\r\nthat the Jurassic system derives its name--but Triassic, Cretaceous and\r\nTertiary beds take part in its formation. It may be divided into three\r\nzones which run parallel to the length of the chain and differ from one\r\nanother in their structure. The innermost zone, which rises directly\r\nfrom the plain of Switzerland, is the _folded Jura_ (_Jura plissé,\r\nKettenjura_), formed of narrow parallel undulations which diminish in\r\nintensity towards the French border. This is followed by the _Jura\r\nplateau_ (_Jura tabulaire_, _Tafeljura_), in which the beds are\r\napproximately horizontal but are broken up into blocks by fractures or\r\nfaults. Finally, along its western face there is a zone of numerous\r\ndislocations, and the range descends abruptly to the plain of the Saône.\r\nThis is the _Région du vignoble_ and is well shown at Arbois.\r\n\r\nOwing to the convergence of the faults which bound it, the plateau zone\r\ndecreases in width towards the south, while towards the north it forms a\r\nlarge proportion of the chain. The folded zone is more constant. Along\r\nits inner margin the folds are frequently overthrown, leaning towards\r\nFrance, but elsewhere they are simple anticlinals and synclinals,\r\nparallel to the length of the chain, and as a rule there is a remarkable\r\nfreedom from dislocations of any importance, except towards Neuchâtel\r\nand Bienne.\r\n\r\nThe countless blocks of gneiss, granite and other crystalline formations\r\nwhich are found in such numbers on the slopes of the Jura, and go by the\r\nname of \"erratic blocks\" (of which the best known instance--the Pierre à\r\nBot--is 40 ft. in diameter, and rests on the side of a hill 800 ft.\r\nabove the Lake of Neuchâtel), have been transported thither from the\r\nAlps by ancient glaciers, which have left their mark on the Jura range\r\nitself in the shape of striations and moraines.\r\n\r\nThe general direction of the chain is from north-east to south-west, but\r\na careful study reveals the fact that there were in reality two main\r\nlines of upheaval, viz. north to south and east to west, the former best\r\nseen in the southern part of the range and the latter in the northern;\r\nand it was by the union of these two forces that the lines north-east to\r\nsouth-west (seen in the greater part of the chain), and north-west to\r\nsouth-east (seen in the Villebois range at the south-west extremity of\r\nthe chain), were produced. This is best realized if we take Besançon as\r\na centre; to the north the ridges run east and west, to the south, north\r\nand south, while to the east the direction is north-east to south-west.\r\n\r\n  Before considering the topography of the interior of the Jura, it may\r\n  be convenient to take a brief survey of its outer slopes.\r\n\r\n  1. The _northern face_ dominates on one side the famous \"Trouée\" (or\r\n  Trench) of Belfort, one of the great geographical centres of Europe,\r\n  whence routes run north down the Rhine to the North Sea, south-east to\r\n  the Danube basin and Black Sea, and south-west into France, and so to\r\n  the Mediterranean basin. It is now so strongly fortified that it\r\n  becomes a question of great strategical importance to prevent its\r\n  being turned by means of the great central plateau of the Jura, which,\r\n  as we shall see, is a network of roads and railways. On the other side\r\n  it overhangs the \"Trouée\" of the Black Forest towns on the Rhine\r\n  (Rheinfelden, Säckingen, Laufenburg and Waldshut), through which the\r\n  central plain of Switzerland is easily gained. On this north slope two\r\n  openings offer routes into the interior of the chain--the valley of\r\n  the Doubs belonging to France, and the valley of the Birse belonging\r\n  to Switzerland. Belfort is the military, Mülhausen the industrial, and\r\n  Basel the commercial centre of this slope.\r\n\r\n  2. The _eastern and western faces_ offer many striking parallels. The\r\n  plains through which flow the Aar and the Saône have each been the bed\r\n  of an ancient lake, traces of which remain in the lakes of Neuchâtel,\r\n  Bienne and Morat. The west face runs mainly north and south like its\r\n  great river, and for a similar reason the east face runs north-east to\r\n  south-west. Again, both slopes are pierced by many transverse gorges\r\n  or \"cluses\" (due to fracture and not to erosion), by which access is\r\n  gained to the great central plateau of Pontarlier, though these are\r\n  seen more plainly on the east face than on the west; thus the gorges\r\n  at the exit from which Lons-le-Saunier, Poligny, Arbois and Salins are\r\n  built balance those of the Suze, of the Val de Ruz, of the Val de\r\n  Travers, and of the Val d'Orbe, though on the east face there is but\r\n  one city which commands all these important routes--Neuchâtel. This\r\n  town is thus marked out by nature as a great military and industrial\r\n  centre, just as is Besançon on the west, which has besides to defend\r\n  the route from Belfort down the Doubs. These easy means of\r\n  communicating with the Free County of Burgundy or Franche-Comté\r\n  account for the fact that the dialect of Neuchâtel is Burgundian, and\r\n  that it was held generally by Burgundian nobles, though most of the\r\n  country near it was in the hands of the house of Savoy until gradually\r\n  annexed by Bern. The Chasseron (5286 ft.) is the central point of the\r\n  eastern face, commanding the two great railways which join Neuchâtel\r\n  and Pontarlier. This ridge is in a certain sense parallel to the\r\n  valley of the Loue on the west face, which flows into the Doubs a\r\n  little to the south of Dôle, the only important town of the central\r\n  portion of the Saône basin. The Chasseron is wholly Swiss, as are the\r\n  lower summits of the Chasseral (5279 ft.), the Mont Suchet (5220 ft.),\r\n  the Aiguille de Baulmes (5128 ft.), the Dent de Vaulion (4879 ft.),\r\n  the Weissenstein (4223 ft.), and the Chaumont (3845 ft.), the two\r\n  last-named points being probably the best-known points in the Jura, as\r\n  they are accessible by carriage road from Soleure and Neuchâtel\r\n  respectively. South of the Orbe valley the east face becomes a rocky\r\n  wall which is crowned by all the highest summits (the first and second\r\n  Swiss, the rest French) of the chain--the Mont Tendre (5512 ft.), the\r\n  Dôle (5505 ft.), the Reculet (5643 ft.), the Crêt de la Neige (5653\r\n  ft.) and the Grand Crédo (5328 ft.), the uniformity of level being as\r\n  striking as on the west edge of the Jura, though there the absolute\r\n  height is far less. The position of the Dôle is similar to that of the\r\n  Chasseron, as along the sides of it run the great roads of the Col de\r\n  St Cergues (3973 ft.) and the Col de la Faucille (4341 ft.), the\r\n  latter leading through the Vallée des Dappes, which was divided in\r\n  1862 between France and Switzerland, after many negotiations. The\r\n  height of these roads shows that they are passages across the chain,\r\n  rather than through natural depressions.\r\n\r\n  3. The _southern face_ is supported by two great pillars--on the east\r\n  by the Grand Crédo and on the west by the ridge of Revermont (2529\r\n  ft.) above Bourg en Bresse; between these a huge bastion (the district\r\n  of _Bugey_) stretches away to the south, forcing the Rhone to make a\r\n  long détour. On the two sides of this bastion the plains in which\r\n  Ambérieu and Culoz stand balance one another, and are the meeting\r\n  points of the routes which cut through the bastion by means of deep\r\n  gorges. On the eastern side this great wedge is steep and rugged,\r\n  ending in the Grand Colombier (5033 ft.) above Culoz, and it sinks on\r\n  the western side to the valley of the Ain, the district of Bresse, and\r\n  the plateau of Dombes. The junction of the Ain and the Surand at Pont\r\n  d'Ain on the west balances that of the Valserine and the Rhone at\r\n  Bellegarde on the east.\r\n\r\n  The Jura thus dominates on the north one of the great highways of\r\n  Europe, on the east and west divides the valleys of the Saône and the\r\n  Aar, and stretches out to the south so as nearly to join hands with\r\n  the great mass of the Dauphiné Alps. It therefore commands the routes\r\n  from France into Germany, Switzerland and Italy, and hence its\r\n  enormous historical importance.\r\n\r\n  Let us now examine the topography of the interior of the range. This\r\n  naturally falls into three divisions, each traversed by one of the\r\n  three great rivers of the Jura--the Doubs, the Loue and the Ain.\r\n\r\n  1. In the _northern division_ it is the east and west line which\r\n  prevails--the Lomont, the Mont Terrible, the defile of the Doubs from\r\n  St Ursanne to St Hippolyte, and the \"Trouée\" of the Black Forest\r\n  towns. It thus bars access to the central plateau from the north, and\r\n  this natural wall does away with the necessity of artificial\r\n  fortifications. This division falls again into two distinct portions.\r\n\r\n  (a) The first is the _part east of the deep gorge of the Doubs_ after\r\n  it turns south at St Hippolyte; it is thus quite cut off on this side,\r\n  and is naturally Swiss territory. It includes the basin of the river\r\n  Birse, and the great plateau between the Doubs and the Aar, on which,\r\n  at an average height of 2600 ft., are situated a number of towns, one\r\n  of the most striking features of the Jura. These include Le Locle\r\n  (q.v.) and La Chaux de Fonds (q.v.), and are mainly occupied with\r\n  watch-making, an industry which does not require bulky machinery, and\r\n  is therefore well fitted for a mountain district.\r\n\r\n  (b) _The part west of the \"cluse\" of the Doubs_: of this, the district\r\n  east of the river Dessoubre, isolated in the interior of the range\r\n  (unlike the Le Locle plateau), is called the Haute Montagne, and is\r\n  given up to cheese-making, curing of hams, saw-mills, &c. But little\r\n  watch-making is carried on there, Besançon being the chief French\r\n  centre of this industry, and being connected with Geneva by a chain of\r\n  places similarly occupied, which fringe the west plateau of the Jura.\r\n  The part west of the Dessoubre, or the Moyenne Montagne, a huge\r\n  plateau north of the Loue, is more especially devoted to agriculture,\r\n  while along its north edge metal-working and manufacture of hardware\r\n  are carried on, particularly at Besançon and Audincourt.\r\n\r\n  2. The _central division_ is remarkable for being without the deep\r\n  gorges which are found so frequently in other parts of the range. It\r\n  consists of the basin of which Pontarlier is the centre, through\r\n  notches in the rim of which routes converge from every direction; this\r\n  is the great characteristic of the middle region of the Jura. Hence\r\n  its immense strategical and commercial importance. On the north-east\r\n  roads run to Morteau and Le Locle, on the north-west to Besançon, on\r\n  the west to Salins, on the south-west to Dôle and Lons-le-Saunier, on\r\n  the east to the Swiss plain. The Pontarlier plateau is nearly\r\n  horizontal, the slight indentations in it being due to erosion, e.g.\r\n  by the river Drugeon. The keys to this important plateau are to the\r\n  east the Fort de Joux, under the walls of which meet the two lines of\r\n  railway from Neuchâtel, and to the west Salins, the meeting place of\r\n  the routes from the Col de la Faucille, from Besançon, and from the\r\n  French plain.\r\n\r\n  The Ain rises on the south edge of this plateau, and on a lower shelf\r\n  or step, which it waters, are situated two points of great military\r\n  importance--Nozeroy and Champagnole. The latter is specially\r\n  important, since the road leading thence to Geneva traverses one after\r\n  another, not far from their head, the chief valleys which run down\r\n  into the South Jura, and thus commands the southern routes as well as\r\n  those by St Cergues and the Col de la Faucille from the Geneva region,\r\n  and a branch route along the Orbe river from Jougne. The fort of Les\r\n  Rousses, near the foot of the Dôle, serves as an advanced post to\r\n  Champagnole, just as the Fort de Joux does to Pontarlier.\r\n\r\n  The above sketch will serve to show the character of the central Jura\r\n  as the meeting place of routes from all sides, and the importance to\r\n  France of its being strongly fortified, lest an enemy approaching from\r\n  the north-east should try to turn the fortresses of the \"Trouée de\r\n  Belfort.\" It is in the western part of the central Jura that the north\r\n  and south lines first appear strongly marked. There are said to be in\r\n  this district no less than fifteen ridges running parallel to each\r\n  other, and it is these which force the Loue to the north, and thereby\r\n  occasion its very eccentric course. The cultivation of wormwood\r\n  wherewith to make the tonic \"absinthe\" has its headquarters at\r\n  Pontarlier.\r\n\r\n  3. The _southern division_ is by far the most complicated and\r\n  entangled part of the Jura. The lofty ridge which bounds it to the\r\n  east forces all its drainage to the west, and the result is a number\r\n  of valleys of erosion (of which that of the Ain is the chief\r\n  instance), quite distinct from the natural \"cluses\" or fissures of\r\n  those of the Doubs and of the Loue. Another point of interest is the\r\n  number of roads which intersect it, despite its extreme irregularity.\r\n  This is due to the great \"cluses\" of Nantua and Virieu, which traverse\r\n  it from east to west. The north and south line is very clearly seen in\r\n  the eastern part of this division; the north-east and south-west is\r\n  entirely wanting, but in the Villebois range south of Ambérieu we have\r\n  the principal example of the north-west to south-east line. The\r\n  plateaus west of the Ain are cut through by the valleys of the Valouse\r\n  and of the Surand, and like all the lowest terraces on the west slope\r\n  do not possess any considerable towns. The Ain receives three\r\n  tributaries from the east:--\r\n\r\n  (a) The Bienne, which flows from the fort of Les Rousses by St Claude,\r\n  the industrial centre of the south Jura, famous for the manufacture of\r\n  wooden toys, owing to the large quantity of boxwood in the\r\n  neighbourhood. Septmoncel is busied with cutting of gems, and Morez\r\n  with watch and spectacle making. Cut off to the east by the great\r\n  chain, the industrial prosperity of this valley is of recent origin.\r\n\r\n  (b) The Oignin, which flows from south to north. It receives the\r\n  drainage of the lake of Nantua, a town noted for combs and silk\r\n  weaving, and which communicates by the \"cluse\" of the Lac de Silan\r\n  with the Valserine valley, and so with the Rhone at Bellegarde, and\r\n  again with the various routes which meet under the walls of the fort\r\n  of Les Rousses, while by the Val Romey and the Séran Culoz is easily\r\n  gained.\r\n\r\n  (c) The Albarine, connected with Culoz by the \"cluse\" of Virieu, and\r\n  by the Furan flowing south with Belley, the capital of the district of\r\n  Bugey (the old name for the South Jura).\r\n\r\n  The \"cluses\" of Nantua and Virieu are now both traversed by important\r\n  railways; and it is even truer than of old that the keys of the south\r\n  Jura are Lyons and Geneva. But of course the strategic importance of\r\n  these gorges is less than appears at first sight, because they can be\r\n  turned by following the Rhone in its great bend to the south.\r\n\r\nThe range is mentioned by Caesar (_Bell. Gall._ i. 2-3, 6 (1), and 8\r\n(1)), Strabo (iv. 3, 4, and 6, 11), Pliny (iii. 31; iv. 105; xvi. 197)\r\nand Ptolemy (ii. ix. 5), its name being a word which appears under many\r\nforms (e.g. Joux, Jorat, Jorasse, Juriens), and is a synonym for a wood\r\nor forest. The German name is Leberberg, _Leber_ being a provincial word\r\nfor a hill.\r\n\r\nPolitically the Jura is French (departments of the Doubs, Jura and Ain)\r\nand Swiss (parts of the cantons of Geneva, Vaud, Neuchâtel, Bern,\r\nSoleure and Basel); but at its north extremity it takes in a small bit\r\nof Alsace (Pfirt or Ferrette). In the middle ages the southern, western\r\nand northern sides were parcelled out into a number of districts, all of\r\nwhich were gradually absorbed by the French crown, viz., Gex, Val Romey,\r\nBresse and Bugey (exchanged in 1601 by Savoy for the marquisate of\r\nSaluzzo), Franche-Comté, or the Free County of Burgundy, an imperial\r\nfief till annexed in 1674, the county of Montbéliard (Mömpelgard)\r\nacquired in 1793, and the county of Ferrette (French 1648-1871). The\r\nnorthern part of the eastern side was held till 1792 (part till 1797) by\r\nthe bishop of Basel as a fief of the empire, and then belonged to France\r\ntill 1814, but was given to Bern in 1815 (as a recompense for its loss\r\nof Vaud), and now forms the Bernese Jura, a French-speaking district.\r\nThe centre of the eastern slope formed the principality of Neuchâtel\r\n(q.v.) and the county of Valangin, which were generally held by\r\nBurgundian nobles, came by succession to the kings of Prussia in 1707,\r\nand were formed into a Swiss canton in 1815, though they did not become\r\nfree from formal Prussian claims until 1857. The southern part of the\r\neastern slope originally belonged to the house of Savoy, but was\r\nconquered bit by bit by Bern, which was forced in 1815 to accept its\r\nsubject district Vaud as a colleague and equal in the Swiss\r\nConfederation. It was Charles the Bold's defeats at Grandson and Morat\r\nwhich led to the annexation by the confederates of these portions of\r\nSavoyard territory.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--E. F.

C.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJURASSIC, in geology, the middle period of the Mesozoic era, that is to\r\nsay, succeeding the Triassic and preceding the Cretaceous periods. The\r\nname Jurassic (French _jurassique_; German _Juraformation_ or _Jura_)\r\nwas first employed by A. Brongniart and A. von Humboldt for the rocks of\r\nthis age in the western Jura mountains of Switzerland, where they are\r\nwell developed. It was in England, however, that they were first studied\r\nby William Smith, in whose hands they were made to lay the foundations\r\nof stratigraphical geology. The names adopted by him for the\r\nsubdivisions he traced across the country have passed into universal\r\nuse, and though some of them are uncouth English provincial names, they\r\nare as familiar to the geologists of France, Switzerland and Germany as\r\nto those of England. During the following three decades Smith's work was\r\nelaborated by W. D. Conybeare and W. Phillips. The Jurassic rocks of\r\nfossils of the European continent were described by d'Orbigny,\r\n1840-1846; by L. von Buch, 1839; by F. A. Quenstedt, 1843-1888; by A.\r\nOppel, 1856-1858; and since then by many other workers: E. Benecke, E.\r\nHébert, W. Waagen, and others. The study of Jurassic rocks has continued\r\nto attract the attention of geologists, partly because the bedding is so\r\nwell defined and regular--the strata are little disturbed anywhere\r\noutside the Swiss Jura and the Alps--and partly because the fossils are\r\nnumerous and usually well-preserved. The result has been that no other\r\nsystem of rocks has been so carefully examined throughout its entire\r\nthickness; many \"zones\" have been established by means of the\r\nfossils--principally by ammonites--and these zones are not restricted to\r\nlimited districts, but many of them hold good over wide areas. Oppel\r\ndistinguished no fewer than thirty-three zonal horizons, and since then\r\nmany more sub-zonal divisions have been noted locally.\r\n\r\nThe existence of _faunal regions_ in Jurassic times was first pointed\r\nout by J. Marcou; later M. Neumayr greatly extended observations in this\r\ndirection. According to Neumayr, three distinct geographical regions of\r\ndeposit can be made out among the Jurassic rocks of Europe: (1) The\r\nMediterranean province, embracing the Pyrenees, Alps and Carpathians,\r\nwith all the tracts lying to the south. One of the biological characters\r\nof this area was the great abundance of ammonites belonging to the\r\ngroups of _Heterophylli_ (_Phylloceras_) and _Fimbriati_ (_Lytoceras_).\r\n(2) The central European province, comprising the tracts lying to the\r\nnorth of the Alpine ridge, and marked by the comparative rarity of the\r\nammonites just mentioned, which are replaced by others of the groups\r\n_Inflati_ (_Aspidoceras_) and _Oppelia_, and by abundant reefs and\r\nmasses of coral. (3) The boreal or Russian province, comprising the\r\nmiddle and north of Russia, Spitzbergen and Greenland. The life in this\r\narea was much less varied than in the others, showing that in Jurassic\r\ntimes there was a perceptible diminution of temperature towards the\r\nnorth. The ammonites of the more southern tracts here disappear,\r\ntogether with the corals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map of the probable distribution of Land & Sea in the\r\nJurassic Period.]\r\n\r\nThe cause of these faunal regions Neumayr attributed to climatic\r\nbelts--such as exist to-day--and in part, at least, he was probably\r\ncorrect. It should be borne in mind, however, that although Neumayr was\r\nable to trace a broad, warm belt, some 60° in width, right round the\r\nearth, with a narrower mild belt to the north and an arctic or boreal\r\nbelt beyond, and certain indications of a repetition of the climatic\r\nzones on the southern side of the thermal equator, more recent\r\ndiscoveries of fossils seem to show that other influences must have been\r\nat work in determining their distribution; in short, the identity of the\r\nNeumayrian climatic boundaries becomes increasingly obscured by the\r\nadvance of our knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe Jurassic period was marked by a great extension of the sea, which\r\ncommenced after the close of the Trias and reached its maximum during\r\nthe Callovian and Oxfordian stages; consequently, the Middle Jurassic\r\nrocks are much more widely spread than the Lias. In Europe and elsewhere\r\nTriassic beds pass gradually up into the Jurassic, so that there is\r\ndifficulty sometimes in agreement as to the best line for the base of\r\nthe latter; similarly at the top of the system there is a passage from\r\nthe Jurassic to the Cretaceous rocks (Alps).\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the period elevation began in certain regions;\r\nthus, in America, the Sierras, Cascade Mountains, Klamath Mountains, and\r\nHumboldt Range probably began to emerge. In England the estuarine\r\nPortlandian resulted partly from elevation, but in the Alps marine\r\nconditions steadily persisted (in the Tithonian stage). There appears to\r\nhave been very little crustal disturbance or volcanic activity; tuffs\r\nare known in Argentina and California; volcanic rocks of this age occur\r\nalso in Skye and Mull.\r\n\r\nThe rocks of the Jurassic system present great petrological diversity.\r\nIn England the name \"Oolites\" was given to the middle and higher members\r\nof the system on account of the prevalence of oolitic structure in the\r\nlimestones and ironstones; the same character is a common feature in the\r\nrocks of northern Europe and elsewhere, but it must not be overlooked\r\nthat clays and sandstones together bulk more largely in the aggregate\r\nthan the oolites. The thickness of Jurassic rocks in England is 4000 to\r\n5000 ft., and in Germany 2000 to 3000 ft. Most of the rocks represent\r\nthe deposits of shallow seas, but estuarine conditions and land deposits\r\noccur as in the Purbeck beds of Dorset and the coals of Yorkshire. Coal\r\nis a very important feature among Jurassic rocks, particularly in the\r\nLiassic division; it is found in Hungary, where there are twenty-five\r\nworkable beds; in Persia, Turkestan, Caucasus, south Siberia, China,\r\nJapan, Further India, New Zealand and in many of the Pacific Islands.\r\n\r\nBeing shallow water formations, petrological changes come in rapidly as\r\nmany of the beds are traced out; sandstones pass laterally into clays,\r\nand the latter into limestones, and so on, but a reliable guide to the\r\nclassification and correlation is found in the fossil contents of the\r\nrocks. In the accompanying table a list is given of some of the zonal\r\nfossils which regularly occur in the order indicated; other forms are\r\nknown that are equally useful. It will be noticed that while there is\r\ngeneral agreement as to the order in which the zonal forms occur, the\r\nline of division between one formation and another is liable to vary\r\naccording to factors in the personal equation of the authors.\r\n\r\nThe Jurassic formations stretch across England in a varying band from\r\nthe mouth of the Tees to the coast of Dorsetshire. They consist of\r\nharder sandstones and limestones interstratified with softer clays and\r\nshales. Hence they give rise to a characteristic type of scenery--the\r\nmore durable beds standing out as long ridges, sometimes even with low\r\ncliffs, while the clays underlie the level spaces between.\r\n\r\n  Jurassic rocks cover a vast area in Central Europe. They rise from\r\n  under the Cretaceous formations in the north-east of France, whence\r\n  they range southwards down the valleys of the Saône and Rhone to the\r\n  Mediterranean. They appear as a broken border round the old\r\n  crystalline nucleus of Auvergne. Eastwards they range through the Jura\r\n  Mountains up to the high grounds of Bohemia. They appear in the outer\r\n  chains of the Alps on both sides, and on the south they rise along the\r\n  centre of the Apennines, and here and there over the Spanish\r\n  Peninsula. Covered by more recent formations they underlie the great\r\n  plain of northern Germany, whence they range eastwards and occupy\r\n  large tracts in central and eastern Russia.\r\n\r\n  Lower Jurassic rocks are absent from much of northern Russia, the\r\n  stages represented being the Callovian, Oxfordian and Volgian (of\r\n  Professor S. Nikitin); the fauna differs considerably from that of\r\n  western Europe, and the marine equivalents of the Purbeck beds are\r\n  found in this region. In south Russia, the Crimea and Caucasus, Lias\r\n  and Lower Jurassic rocks are present. In the Alps, the Lower Jurassic\r\n  rocks are intimately associated with the underlying Triassic\r\n  formations, and resemble them in consisting largely of reddish\r\n  limestones and marbles; the ammonites in this region differ in certain\r\n  respects from those of western and central Europe. The Oxfordian,\r\n  Callovian, Corallian and Astartian stages are also present. The Upper\r\n  Jurassic is mainly represented by a uniform series of limestones, with\r\n  a peculiar and characteristic fauna, to which Oppel gave the name\r\n  \"Tithonian.\" This includes most of the horizons from Kimeridgian to\r\n  Cretaceous; it is developed on the southern flanks of the Alps,\r\n  Carpathians, Apennines, as well as in south France and other parts of\r\n  the Mediterranean basin. A characteristic formation on this horizon is\r\n  the \"Diphya limestone,\" so-called from the fossil _Terebratula diphya_\r\n  (_Pygope janitor_) seen in the well-known escarpments (_Hochgebirge\r\n  Kalk_). Above the Diphya limestone comes the Stramberg limestone\r\n  (Stramberg in Moravia), with \"Aptychus\" beds and coral reefs. The\r\n  rocks of the Mediterranean basin are on the whole more calcareous than\r\n  those of corresponding age in north-west Europe; thus the Lias is\r\n  represented by 1500 ft. of white crystalline limestone in Calabria and\r\n  a similar rock occurs in Sicily, Bosnia, Epirus, Corfu; in Spain the\r\n  Liassic strata are frequently dolomitic; in the Apennines they are\r\n  variegated limestones and marls. The Higher Jurassic beds of Portugal\r\n  show traces of the proximity of land in the abundant plant remains\r\n  that are found in them. In Scania the Lias succeeds the Rhaetic beds\r\n  in a regular manner, and Jurassic rocks have been traced northward\r\n  well within the polar circle; they are known in the Lofoten Isles,\r\n  Spitzbergen, east Greenland, King Charles's Island, Cape Stewart in\r\n  Scoresby Sound, Grinnell Land, Prince Patrick Land, Bathurst and\r\n  Exmouth Island; in many cases the fossils denote a climate\r\n  considerably milder than now obtains in these latitudes.\r\n\r\n  In the American continent Jurassic rocks are not well developed.\r\n  Marine Lower and Middle Jurassic beds occur on the Pacific coast\r\n  (California and Oregon), and in Wyoming, the Dakotas, Colorado, east\r\n  Mexico and Texas. Above the marine beds in the interior are brackish\r\n  and fresh-water deposits, the Morrison and Como beds (Atlantosaurus\r\n  and Baptanodon beds of Marsh). Later Jurassic rocks are found in\r\n  northern British Columbia and perhaps in Alaska, Wyoming, Utah,\r\n  Montana, Colorado, the Dakotas, &c. In California some of the\r\n  gold-bearing, metamorphic slates are of this age. Marine Jurassic\r\n  rocks have not been clearly identified on the Atlantic side of\r\n  America. The Patuxent and Arundel formations (non-marine) are\r\n  doubtfully referred to this period. Lower and Middle Jurassic\r\n  formations occur in Argentina and Bolivia. Jurassic rocks have been\r\n  recognized in Asia, including India, Afghanistan, Persia, Kurdistan,\r\n  Asia Minor, the Caspian region, Japan and Borneo. The best marine\r\n  development is in Cutch, where the following groups are distinguished\r\n  from above downwards: the Umia series = Portlandian and Tithonian of\r\n  south Europe, passing upwards into the Neocomian; the Katrol series =\r\n  Oxfordian (part) and Kimeridgian; the Chari series = Callovian and\r\n  part of the Oxfordian; the Patcham series = Bathonian. In the western\r\n  half of the Salt Range and the Himalayas, Spiti shales are the\r\n  equivalents of the European Callovian and Kimeridgian. The upper part\r\n  of the Gondwana series is not improbably Jurassic. On the African\r\n  continent, Liassic strata are found in Algeria, and Bathonian\r\n  formations occur in Abyssinia, Somaliland, Cape Colony and western\r\n  Madagascar. In Australia the Permo-Carboniferous formations are\r\n  succeeded in Queensland and Western Australia by what may be termed\r\n  the Jura-Trias, which include the coal-bearing \"Ipswich\" and \"Burrum\"\r\n  formations of Queensland. In New Zealand there is a thick series of\r\n  marine beds with terrestrial plants, the Mataura series in the upper\r\n  part of Hutton's Hokanui system. Sir J. Hector included also the\r\n  Putakaka series (as Middle Jurassic) and the Flag series with the\r\n  Catlin's River and Bastion series below. Jurassic rocks have been\r\n  recorded from New Guinea and New Caledonia.\r\n\r\n\r\n    JURASSIC SYSTEM\r\n\r\n

in the Jurassic Period._--The expansion of the sea during this\r\n  period, with the formation of broad sheets of shallow and probably\r\n  warmish water, appears to have been favourable to many forms of marine\r\n  life. Under these conditions several groups of organisms developed\r\n  rapidly along new directions, so that the Jurassic period as a whole\r\n  came to have a fauna differing clearly and distinctly from the\r\n  preceding Palaeozoic or succeeding Tertiary faunas. In the seas, all\r\n  the main groups were represented as they are to-day. Corals were\r\n  abundant, and in later portions of the period covered large areas in\r\n  Europe; the modern type of coral became dominant; besides\r\n  reef-building forms such as _Thamnastrea_, _Isastrea_, _Thecosmilia_,\r\n  there were numerous single forms like _Montivaltia_. Crinoids existed\r\n  in great numbers in some of the shallow seas; compared with Palaeozoic\r\n  forms there is a marked reduction in the size of the calyx with a\r\n  great extension in the number of arms and pinnules; _Pentacrinus_,\r\n  _Eugeniacrinus_, _Apiocrinus_ are all well known; Antedon was a\r\n  stalkless genus. Echinoids (urchins) were gradually developing the\r\n  so-called \"irregular\" type, _Echinobrissus_, _Holectypus_,\r\n  _Collyrites_, _Clypeus_, but the \"regular\" forms prevailed, _Cidaris_,\r\n  _Hemicidaris_, _Acrosalenia_. Sponges were important rock-builders in\r\n  Upper Jurassic times (_Spongiten Kalk_); they include lithistids such\r\n  as _Cnemediastrum_, _Hyalotragus_, _Peronidella_; hexactinellids,\r\n  _Tremadictyon_, _Craticularia_; and horny sponges have been found in\r\n  the Lias and Middle Jurassic.\r\n\r\n  Polyzoa are found abundantly in some of the beds, _Stomatopora_,\r\n  _Berenicia_, &c. Brachiopods were represented principally by\r\n  terebratulids (_Terebratula_, _Waldheimia_, _Megerlea_), and by\r\n  rhynchonellids; _Thecae_, _Lingula_ and _Crania_ were also present.\r\n  The Palaeozoic spirifirids and athyrids still lingered into the Lias.\r\n  More important than the brachiopods were the pelecypods; _Ostrea_,\r\n  _Exogyra_, _Gryphaea_ were very abundant (Gryphite limestone, Gryphite\r\n  grit); the genus _Trigonia_, now restricted to Australian waters, was\r\n  present in great variety; _Aucella_, _Lima_, _Pecten_, _Pseudomonotis_\r\n  _Gervillia_, _Astarte_, _Diceras_, _Isocardia_, _Pleuromya_ may be\r\n  mentioned out of many others. Amongst the gasteropods the\r\n  _Pleurotomariidae_ and _Turbinidae_ reached their maximum development;\r\n  the Palaeozoic _Conularia_ lived to see the beginning of this period\r\n  (_Pleurotomaria_, _Nerinea_, _Pteroceras_, _Cerithium_, _Turritella_).\r\n\r\n  Cephalopods flourished everywhere; first in importance were the\r\n  ammonites; the Triassic genera _Phylloceras_ and _Lytoceras_ were\r\n  still found in the Jurassic waters, but all the other numerous genera\r\n  were new, and their shells are found with every variation of size and\r\n  ornamentation. Some are characteristic of the older Jurassic rocks,\r\n  _Arietites_, _Aegoceras_, _Amaltheus_, _Harpoceras_, _Oxynoticeras_,\r\n  _Stepheoceras_, and the two genera mentioned above; in the middle\r\n  stages are found _Cosmoceras_, _Perisphinctes_, _Cardioceras_,\r\n  _Kepplerites Aspidoceras_; in the upper stages _Olcostephanus_,\r\n  _Perisphinctes_, _Reineckia_, _Oppelia_. So regularly do certain forms\r\n  characterize definite horizons in the rocks that some thirty zones\r\n  have been distinguished in Europe, and many of them can be traced even\r\n  as far as India. Another cephalopod group, the belemnites, that had\r\n  been dimly outlined in the preceding Trias, now advanced rapidly in\r\n  numbers and in variety of form, and they, like the ammonites, have\r\n  proved of great value as zone-indicators. The Sepioids or cuttlefish\r\n  made their first appearance in this period (_Beloteuthis_,\r\n  _Geoteuthis_,) and their ink-bags can still be traced in examples from\r\n  the Lias and lithographic limestone. Nautiloids existed but they were\r\n  somewhat rare.\r\n\r\n  A great change had come over the crustaceans; in place of the\r\n  Palaeozoic trilobites we find long-tailed lobster-like forms,\r\n  _Penaeus_, _Eryon_, _Magila_, and the broad crab-like type first\r\n  appeared in _Prosopon_. Isopods were represented by _Archaeoniscus_\r\n  and others. Insects have left fairly abundant remains in the Lias of\r\n  England, Schambelen (Switzerland) and Dobbertin (Mecklenburg), and\r\n  also in the English Purbeck. Neuropterous forms predominate, but\r\n  hemiptera occur from the Lias upwards; the earliest known flies\r\n  (Diptera) and ants (Hymenoptera) appeared; orthoptera, cockroaches,\r\n  crickets, beetles, &c., are found in the Lias, Stonesfield slate and\r\n  Purbeck beds.\r\n\r\n  Fishes were approaching the modern forms during this period,\r\n  heterocercal ganoids becoming scarce (the _Coelacanthidae_ reached\r\n  their maximum development), while the homocercal forms were abundant\r\n  (_Gyrodus_, _Microdon_, _Lepidosteus_, _Lepidotus_, _Dapedius_). The\r\n  Chimaeridae, sea-cats, made their appearance (_Squaloraja_). The\r\n  ancestors of the modern sturgeons, garpikes and selachians, _Hybodus_,\r\n  _Acrodus_ were numerous. Bony-fish were represented by the small\r\n  _Leptolepis_.\r\n\r\n  So important a place was occupied by reptiles during this period that\r\n  it has been well described as the \"age of reptiles.\" In the seas the\r\n  fish-shaped Ichthyosaurs and long-necked Plesiosaurs dwelt in great\r\n  numbers and reached their maximum development; the latter ranged in\r\n  size from 6 to 40 ft. in length. The Pterosaurs, with bat-like wings\r\n  and pneumatic bones and keeled breast-bone, flew over the land;\r\n  _Pterodactyl_ with short tail and _Rhamphorhyncus_ with long tail are\r\n  the best known. Curiously modified crocodilians appeared late in the\r\n  period (_Mystriosaurus_, _Geosaurus_, _Steneosaurus_, _Teleosaurus_).\r\n  But even more striking than any of the above were the Dinosaurs; these\r\n  ranged in size from a creature no larger than a rabbit up to the\r\n  gigantic _Atlantosaurus_, 100 ft. long, in the Jurassic of Wyoming.\r\n  Both herbivorous and carnivorous forms were present; _Brontosaurus_,\r\n  _Megalosaurus_, _Stegosaurus_, _Cetiosaurus_, _Diplodocus_,\r\n  _Ceratosaurus_ and _Campsognathus_ are a few of the genera. By\r\n  comparison with the Dinosaurs the mammals took a very subordinate\r\n  position in Jurassic times; only a few jaws have been found, belonging\r\n  to quite small creatures; they appear to have been marsupials and were\r\n  probably insectivorous (_Plagiaulax Bolodon_, _Triconodon_,\r\n  _Phascolotherium_, _Stylacodon_). Of great interest are the remains of\r\n  the earliest known bird (_Archaeopteryx_) from the Solenhofen slates\r\n  of Bavaria. Although this was a great advance beyond the Pterodactyls\r\n  in avian characters, yet many reptilian features were retained.\r\n\r\n  Comparatively little change took place in the vegetation in the time\r\n  that elapsed between the close of the Triassic and the middle of the\r\n  Jurassic periods. Cycads, _Zamites_, _Podozamites_, &c., appeared to\r\n  reach their maximum; Equisetums were still found growing to a great\r\n  size and Ginkgos occupied a prominent place; ferns were common; so too\r\n  were pines, yews, cypresses and other conifers, which while they\r\n  outwardly resembled their modern representatives, were quite distinct\r\n  in species. No flowering plants had yet appeared, although a primitive\r\n  form of angiosperm has been reported from the Upper Jurassic of\r\n  Portugal.\r\n\r\n  The economic products of the Jurassic system are of considerable\r\n  importance; the valuable coals have already been noticed; the\r\n  well-known iron ores of the Cleveland district in Yorkshire and those\r\n  of the Northampton sands occur respectively in the Lias and Inferior\r\n  Oolites. Oil shales are found in Germany, and several of the Jurassic\r\n  formations in England contain some petroleum. Building stones of great\r\n  value are obtained from the Great Oolite, the Portlandian and the\r\n  Inferior Oolite; large quantities of hydraulic cement and lime have\r\n  been made from the Lias. The celebrated lithographic stone of\r\n  Solenhofen in Bavaria belongs to the upper portion of this system.\r\n\r\n  See D'Orbigny, _Paléontologie française_, _Terrain Jurassique_ (1840,\r\n  1846); L. von Buch, \"Über den Jura in Deutschland\" (_Abhand. d.

Lat. _juratus_, one sworn, Lat. _jurare_,\r\nto swear), a name given to the sworn holders of certain offices. Under\r\nthe _ancien régime_ in France, in several towns, of the south-west, such\r\nas Rochelle and Bordeaux, the _jurats_ were members of the municipal\r\nbody. The title was also borne by officials, corresponding to aldermen,\r\nin the Cinque Ports, but is now chiefly used as a title of office in the\r\nChannel Islands. There are two bodies, consisting each of twelve jurats,\r\nfor Jersey and the bailiwick of Guernsey respectively. They are elected\r\nfor life, in Jersey by the ratepayers, in Guernsey by the elective\r\nstates. They form, with the bailiff as presiding judge, the royal court\r\nof justice, and are a constituent part of the legislative bodies. In\r\nEnglish law, the word jurat (_juratum_) is applied to that part of an\r\naffidavit which contains the names of the parties swearing the affidavit\r\nand the person before whom it was sworn, the date, place and other\r\nnecessary particulars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJURIEN DE LA GRAVIÈRE, JEAN BAPTISTE EDMOND (1812-1892), French admiral,\r\nson of Admiral Jurien, who served through the Revolutionary and\r\nNapoleonic wars and was a peer of France under Louis Philippe, was born\r\non the 19th of November 1812. He entered the navy in 1828, was made a\r\ncommander in 1841, and captain in 1850. During the Russian War he\r\ncommanded a ship in the Black Sea. He was promoted to be rear-admiral on\r\nthe 1st of December 1855, and appointed to the command of a squadron in\r\nthe Adriatic in 1859, when he absolutely sealed the Austrian ports with\r\na close blockade. In October 1861 he was appointed to command the\r\nsquadron in the Gulf of Mexico, and two months later the expedition\r\nagainst Mexico. On the 15th of January 1862 he was promoted to be\r\nvice-admiral. During the Franco-German War of 1870 he had command of the\r\nFrench Mediterranean fleet, and in 1871 he was appointed \"director of\r\ncharts.\" As having commanded in chief before the enemy, the age-limit\r\nwas waived in his favour, and he was continued on the active list.\r\nJurien died on the 4th of March 1892. He was a voluminous author of\r\nworks on naval history and biography, most of which first appeared in\r\nthe _Revue des deux mondes_. Among the most noteworthy of these are\r\n_Guerres maritimes sous la république et l'empire_, which was translated\r\nby Lord Dunsany under the title of _Sketches of the Last Naval War_\r\n(1848); _Souvenirs d'un amiral_ (1860), that is, of his father, Admiral\r\nJurien; _La Marine d'autrefois_ (1865), largely autobiographical; and\r\n_La Marine d'aujourd'hui_ (1872). In 1866 he was elected a member of the\r\nAcademy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJURIEU, PIERRE (1637-1713), French Protestant divine, was born at Mer,\r\nin Orléanais, where his father was a Protestant pastor. He studied at\r\nSaumur and Sedan under his grandfather, Pierre Dumoulin, and under\r\nLeblanc de Beaulieu. After completing his studies in Holland and\r\nEngland, Jurieu received Anglican ordination; returning to France he was\r\nordained again and succeeded his father as pastor of the church at Mer.\r\nSoon after this he published his first work, _Examen de livre de la\r\nréunion du Christianisme_ (1671). In 1674 his _Traité de la dévotion_\r\nled to his appointment as professor of theology and Hebrew at Sedan,\r\nwhere he soon became also pastor. A year later he published his\r\n_Apologie pour la morale des Réformés_. He obtained a high reputation,\r\nbut his work was impaired by his controversial temper, which frequently\r\ndeveloped into an irritated fanaticism, though he was always entirely\r\nsincere. He was called by his adversaries \"the Goliath of the\r\nProtestants.\" On the suppression of the academy of Sedan in 1681, Jurieu\r\nreceived an invitation to a church at Rouen, but, afraid to remain in\r\nFrance on account of his forthcoming work, _La Politique du clergé de\r\nFrance_, he went to Holland and was pastor of the Walloon church of\r\nRotterdam till his death on the 11th of January 1713. He was also\r\nprofessor at the école illustre. Jurieu did much to help those who\r\nsuffered by the revocation of the Edict of Nantes (1685). He himself\r\nturned for consolation to the Apocalypse, and succeeded in persuading\r\nhimself (_Accomplissement des prophéties_, 1686) that the overthrow of\r\nAntichrist (i.e. the papal church) would take place in 1689. H. M. Baird\r\nsays that \"this persuasion, however fanciful the grounds on which it was\r\nbased, exercised no small influence in forwarding the success of the\r\ndesigns of William of Orange in the invasion of England.\" Jurieu\r\ndefended the doctrines of Protestantism with great ability against the\r\nattacks of Antoine Arnauld, Pierre Nicole and Bossuet, but was equally\r\nready to enter into dispute with his fellow Protestant divines (with\r\nLouis Du Moulin and Claude Payon, for instance) when their opinions\r\ndiffered from his own even on minor matters. The bitterness and\r\npersistency of his attacks on his colleague Pierre Bayle led to the\r\nlatter being deprived of his chair in 1693.\r\n\r\n  One of Jurieu's chief works is _Lettres pastorales adressées aux\r\n  fidèles de France_ (3 vols., Rotterdam, 1686-1687; Eng. trans., 1689),\r\n  which, notwithstanding the vigilance of the police, found its way into\r\n  France and produced a deep impression on the Protestant population.\r\n  His last important work was the _Histoire critique des dogmes et des\r\n  cultes_ (1704; Eng. trans., 1715). He wrote a great number of\r\n  controversial works.\r\n\r\n  See the article in Herzog-Hauck, _Realencyklopädie_; also H. M. Baird,\r\n  _The Huguenots and the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes_ (1895).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJURIS, a tribe of South American Indians, formerly occupying the country\r\nbetween the rivers Iça (lower Putumayo) and Japura, north-western\r\nBrazil. In ancient days they were the most powerful tribe of the\r\ndistrict, but in 1820 their numbers did not exceed 2000. Owing to\r\ninter-marrying, the Juris are believed to have been extinct for half a\r\ncentury. They were closely related to the Passes, and were like them a\r\nfair-skinned, finely built people with quite European features.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJURISDICTION, in general, the exercise of lawful authority, especially\r\nby a court or a judge; and so the extent or limits within which such\r\nauthority is exercisable. Thus each court has its appropriate\r\njurisdiction; in the High Court of Justice in England administration\r\nactions are brought in the chancery division, salvage actions in the\r\nadmiralty, &c. The jurisdiction of a particular court is often limited\r\nby statute, as that of a county court, which is local and is also\r\nlimited in amount. In international law jurisdiction has a wider\r\nmeaning, namely, the rights exercisable by a state within the bounds of\r\na given space. This is frequently referred to as the territorial theory\r\nof jurisdiction. (See INTERNATIONAL LAW; INTERNATIONAL LAW, PRIVATE.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJURISPRUDENCE (Lat. _jurisprudentia_, knowledge of law, from _jus_,\r\nright, and _prudentia_, from _providere_, to foresee), the general term\r\nfor \"the formal science of positive law\" (T. E. Holland); see LAW. The\r\nessential principles involved are discussed below and in JURISPRUDENCE,\r\nCOMPARATIVE; the details of particular laws or sorts of law (CONTRACT,\r\n&c.) and of individual national systems of law (ENGLISH LAW, &c.) being\r\ndealt with in separate articles.\r\n\r\nThe human race may be conceived as parcelled out into a number of\r\ndistinct groups or societies, differing greatly in size and\r\ncircumstances, in physical and moral characteristics of all kinds. But\r\nthey all resemble each other in that they reveal on examination certain\r\nrules of conduct in accordance with which the relations of the members\r\n_inter se_ are governed. Each society has its own system of laws, and\r\nall the systems, so far as they are known, constitute the appropriate\r\nsubject matter of jurisprudence. The jurist may deal with it in the\r\nfollowing ways. He may first of all examine the leading conceptions\r\ncommon to all the systems, or in other words define the leading terms\r\ncommon to them all. Such are the terms _law_ itself, _right_, _duty_,\r\n_property_, _crime_, and so forth, which, or their equivalents, may,\r\nnotwithstanding delicate differences of connotation, be regarded as\r\ncommon terms in all systems. That kind of inquiry is known in England as\r\nanalytical jurisprudence. It regards the conceptions with which it deals\r\nas fixed or stationary, and aims at expressing them distinctly and\r\nexhibiting their logical relations with each other. What is really meant\r\nby a right and by a duty, and what is the true connexion between a right\r\nand a duty, are types of the questions proper to this inquiry. Shifting\r\nour point of view, but still regarding systems of law in the mass, we\r\nmay consider them, not as stationary, but as changeable and changing, we\r\nmay ask what general features are exhibited by the record of the change.\r\nThis, somewhat crudely put, may serve to indicate the field of\r\nhistorical or comparative jurisprudence. In its ideal condition it would\r\nrequire an accurate record of the history of all legal systems as its\r\nmaterial. But whether the material be abundant or scanty the method is\r\nthe same. It seeks the explanation of institutions and legal principles\r\nin the facts of history. Its aim is to show how a given rule came to be\r\nwhat it is. The legislative source--the emanation of the rule from a\r\nsovereign authority--is of no importance here; what is important is the\r\nmoral source--the connexion of the rule with the ideas prevalent during\r\ncontemporary periods. This method, it is evident, involves not only a\r\ncomparison of successive stages in the history of the same system, but a\r\ncomparison of different systems, of the Roman with the English, of the\r\nHindu with the Irish, and so on. The historical method as applied to law\r\nmay be regarded as a special example of the method of comparison. The\r\ncomparative method is really employed in all generalizations about law;\r\nfor, although the analysis of legal terms might be conducted with\r\nexclusive reference to one system, the advantage of testing the result\r\nby reference to other systems is obvious. But, besides the use of\r\ncomparison for purposes of analysis and in tracing the phenomena of the\r\ngrowth of laws, it is evident that for the purposes of practical\r\nlegislation the comparison of different systems may yield important\r\nresults. Laws are contrivances for bringing about certain definite ends,\r\nthe larger of which are identical in all systems. The comparison of\r\nthese contrivances not only serves to bring their real object, often\r\nobscured as it is in details, into clearer view, but enables legislators\r\nto see where the contrivances are deficient, and how they may be\r\nimproved.\r\n\r\nThe \"science of law,\" as the expression is generally used, means the\r\nexamination of laws in general in one or other of the ways just\r\nindicated. It means an investigation of laws which exist or have existed\r\nin some given society in fact--in other words, positive laws; and it\r\nmeans an examination not limited to the exposition of particular\r\nsystems. Analytical jurisprudence is in England associated chiefly with\r\nthe name of John Austin (q.v.), whose _Province of Jurisprudence\r\nDetermined_ systematized and completed the work begun in England by\r\nHobbes, and continued at a later date and from a different point of view\r\nby Bentham.\r\n\r\nAustin's first position is to distinguish between laws properly so\r\ncalled and laws improperly so called. In any of the older writers on\r\nlaw, we find the various senses in which the word is used grouped\r\ntogether as variations of one common meaning. Thus Blackstone advances\r\nto his proper subject, municipal laws, through (1) the laws of inanimate\r\nmatter, (2) the laws of animal nutrition, digestion, &c., (3) the laws\r\nof nature, which are rules imposed by God on men and discoverable by\r\nreason alone, and (4) the revealed or divine law which is part of the\r\nlaw of nature directly expounded by God. All of these are connected by\r\nthis common element that they are \"rules of action dictated by some\r\nsuperior being.\" And some such generalization as this is to be found at\r\nthe basis of most treatises on jurisprudence which have not been\r\ncomposed under the influence of the analytical school. Austin disposes\r\nof it by the distinction that some of those laws are commands, while\r\nothers are not commands. The so-called laws of nature are not commands;\r\nthey are uniformities which resemble commands only in so far as they may\r\nbe supposed to have been ordered by some intelligent being. But they are\r\nnot commands in the only proper sense of that word--they are not\r\naddressed to reasonable beings, who may or may not will obedience to\r\nthem. Laws of nature are not addressed to anybody, and there is no\r\npossible question of obedience or disobedience to them. Austin\r\naccordingly pronounces them laws improperly so called, and confines his\r\nattention to laws properly so called, which are commands addressed by a\r\nhuman superior to a human inferior.\r\n\r\nThis distinction seems so simple and obvious that the energy and even\r\nbitterness with which Austin insists upon it now seem superfluous. But\r\nthe indiscriminate identification of everything to which common speech\r\ngives the name of a law was, and still is, a fruitful source of\r\nconfusion. Blackstone's statement that when God \"put matter into motion\r\nHe established certain laws of motion, to which all movable matter must\r\nconform,\" and that in those creatures that have neither the power to\r\nthink nor to will such laws must be invariably obeyed, so long as the\r\ncreature itself subsists, for its existence depends on that obedience,\r\nimputes to the law of gravitation in respect of both its origin and its\r\nexecution the qualities of an act of parliament. On the other hand the\r\nqualities of the law of gravitation are imputed to certain legal\r\nprinciples which, under the name of the law of nature, are asserted to\r\nbe binding all over the globe, so that \"no human laws are of any\r\nvalidity if contrary to this.\" Austin never fails to stigmatize the use\r\nof \"natural laws\" in the sense of scientific facts as improper, or as\r\nmetaphorical.\r\n\r\nHaving eliminated metaphorical or figurative laws, we restrict ourselves\r\nto those laws which are commands. This word is the key to the analysis\r\nof law, and accordingly a large portion of Austin's work is occupied\r\nwith the determination of its meaning. A _command_ is an order issued by\r\na superior to an inferior. It is a signification of desire distinguished\r\nby this peculiarity that \"the party to whom it is directed is liable to\r\nevil from the other, in case he comply not with the desire.\" \"If you are\r\nable and willing to harm me in case I comply not with your wish, the\r\nexpression of your wish amounts to a command.\" Being liable to evil in\r\ncase I comply not with the wish which you signify, I am _bound_ or\r\nobliged by it, or I lie under a _duty_ to obey it. The evil is called a\r\n_sanction_, and the command or duty is said to be _sanctioned_ by the\r\nchance of incurring the evil. The three terms _command_, _duty_ and\r\n_sanction_ are thus inseparably connected. As Austin expresses it in the\r\nlanguage of formal logic, \"each of the three terms signifies the same\r\nnotion, but each _denotes_ a different part of that notion and\r\n_connotes_ the residue.\"\r\n\r\nAll commands, however, are not laws. That term is reserved for those\r\ncommands which oblige generally to the performance of acts of a class. A\r\ncommand to your servant to rise at such an hour on such a morning is a\r\nparticular command, but not a law or rule; a command to rise always at\r\nthat hour is a law or rule. Of this distinction it is sufficient to say\r\nin the meantime that it involves, when we come to deal with positive\r\nlaws, the rejection of particular enactments to which by inveterate\r\nusage the term law would certainly be applied. On the other hand it is\r\nnot, according to Austin, necessary that a true law should bind persons\r\nas a class. Obligations imposed on the grantee of an office specially\r\ncreated by parliament would imply a law; a general order to go into\r\nmourning addressed to the whole nation for a particular occasion would\r\nnot be a law.\r\n\r\nSo far we have arrived at a definition of laws properly so called.\r\nAustin holds superiority and inferiority to be necessarily implied in\r\ncommand, and such statements as that \"laws emanate from superiors\" to be\r\nthe merest tautology and trifling. Elsewhere he sums up the\r\ncharacteristics of true laws as ascertained by the analysis thus: (1)\r\nlaws, being commands, emanate from a determinate source; (2) every\r\nsanction is an evil annexed to a command; and (3) every duty implies a\r\ncommand, and chiefly means obnoxiousness to the evils annexed to\r\ncommands.\r\n\r\nOf true laws, those only are the subject of jurisprudence which are laws\r\nstrictly so called, or positive laws. Austin accordingly proceeds to\r\ndistinguish positive from other true laws, which are either laws set by\r\nGod to men or laws set by men to men, not, however, as political\r\nsuperiors nor in pursuance of a legal right. The discussion of the first\r\nof these true but not positive laws leads Austin to his celebrated\r\ndiscussion of the utilitarian theory. The laws set by God are either\r\nrevealed or unrevealed, i.e. either expressed in direct command, or made\r\nknown to men in one or other of the ways denoted by such phrases as the\r\n\"light of nature,\" \"natural reason,\" \"dictates of nature,\" and so forth.\r\nAustin maintains that the principle of general utility, based ultimately\r\non the assumed benevolence of God, is the true index to such of His\r\ncommands as He has not chosen to reveal. Austin's exposition of the\r\nmeaning of the principle is a most valuable contribution to moral\r\nscience, though he rests its claims ultimately on a basis which many of\r\nits supporters would disavow. And the whole discussion is now generally\r\ncondemned as lying outside the proper scope of the treatise, although\r\nthe reason for so condemning it is not always correctly stated. It is\r\nfound in such assumptions of fact as that there is a God, that He has\r\nissued commands to men in what Austin calls the \"truths of revelation,\"\r\nthat He designs the happiness of all His creatures, that there is a\r\npredominance of good in the order of the world--which do not now command\r\nuniversal assent. It is impossible to place these propositions on the\r\nsame scientific footing as the assumptions of fact with reference to\r\nhuman society on which jurisprudence rests. If the \"divine laws\" were\r\nfacts like acts of parliament, it is conceived that the discussion of\r\ntheir characteristics would not be out of place in a scheme of\r\njurisprudence.\r\n\r\nThe second set of laws properly so called, which are not positive laws,\r\nconsists of three classes: (1) those which are set by men living in a\r\nstate of nature; (2) those which are set by sovereigns but not as\r\npolitical superiors, e.g. when one sovereign commands another to act\r\naccording to a principle of international law; and (3) those set by\r\nsubjects but not in pursuance of legal rights. This group, to which\r\nAustin gives the name of positive morality, helps to explain his\r\nconception of positive law. Men are living in a state of nature, or a\r\nstate of anarchy, when they are not living in a state of government or\r\nas members of a political society. \"Political society\" thus becomes the\r\ncentral fact of the theory, and some of the objections that have been\r\nurged against it arise from its being applied to conditions of life in\r\nwhich Austin would not have admitted the existence of a political\r\nsociety. Again, the third set in the group is intimately connected with\r\npositive laws on the one hand and rules of positive morality which are\r\nnot even laws properly so called on the other. Thus laws set by subjects\r\nin consequence of a legal right are clothed with legal sanctions, and\r\nare laws positive. A law set by guardian to ward, in pursuance of a\r\nright which the guardian is bound to exercise, is a positive law pure\r\nand simple; a law set by master to slave, in pursuance of a legal right,\r\nwhich he is not bound to exercise, is, in Austin's phraseology, to be\r\nregarded both as a positive moral rule and as a positive law.[1] On the\r\nother hand the rules set by a club or society, and enforced upon its\r\nmembers by exclusion from the society, but not in pursuance of any legal\r\nright, are laws, but not positive laws. They are imperative and proceed\r\nfrom a determinate source, but they have no legal or political\r\nsanction. Closely connected with this positive morality, consisting of\r\ntrue but not positive laws, is the positive morality whose rules are not\r\nlaws properly so called at all, though they are generally denominated\r\nlaws. Such are the laws of honour, the laws of fashion, and, most\r\nimportant of all, international law.\r\n\r\nNowhere does Austin's phraseology come more bluntly into conflict with\r\ncommon usage than in pronouncing the law of nations (which in substance\r\nis a compact body of well-defined rules resembling nothing so much as\r\nthe ordinary rules of law) to be not laws at all, even in the wider\r\nsense of the term. That the rules of a private club should be law\r\nproperly so called, while the whole mass of international jurisprudence\r\nis mere opinion, shocks our sense of the proprieties of expression. Yet\r\nno man was more careful than Austin to observe these properties. He\r\nrecognizes fully the futility of definitions which involve a painful\r\nstruggle with the current of ordinary speech. But in the present\r\ninstance the apparent paralogism cannot be avoided if we accept the\r\nlimitation of laws properly so called to commands proceeding from a\r\ndeterminate source. And that limitation is so generally present in our\r\nconception of law that to ignore it would be a worse anomaly than this.\r\nNo one finds fault with the statement that the so-called code of honour\r\nor the dictates of fashion are not, properly speaking, laws. We repel\r\nthe same statement applied to the law of nature, because it resembles in\r\nso many of its most striking features--in the certainty of a large\r\nportion of it, in its terminology, in its substantial principles--the\r\nmost universal elements of actual systems of law, and because, moreover,\r\nthe assumption that brought it into existence was nothing else than\r\nthis, that it consisted of those abiding portions of legal systems which\r\nprevail everywhere by their own authority. But, though \"positive\r\nmorality\" may not be the best phrase to describe such a code of rules,\r\nthe distinction insisted on by Austin is unimpeachable.\r\n\r\nThe elimination of those laws properly and improperly so called which\r\nare not positive laws brings us to the definition of positive law, which\r\nis the keystone of the system. Every positive law is \"set by a sovereign\r\nperson, or sovereign body of persons, to a member or members of the\r\nindependent political society wherein that person or body is sovereign\r\nor superior.\" Though possibly sprung directly from another source, it is\r\na positive law, by the institution of that present sovereign in the\r\ncharacter of a political superior. The question is not as to the\r\nhistorical origin of the principle, but as to its present authority.\r\n\"The legislator is he, not by whose authority the law was first made,\r\nbut by whose authority it continues to be law.\" This definition involves\r\nthe analysis of the connected expressions _sovereignty_, _subjection_\r\nand _independent political society_, and of _determinate body_--which\r\nlast analysis Austin performs in connexion with that of commands. These\r\nare all excellent examples of the logical method of which he was so\r\ngreat a master. The broad results alone need be noticed here. In order\r\nthat a given society may form a society political and independent, the\r\n_generality or bulk_ of its members must be in a _habit_ of obedience to\r\na certain and common superior; whilst that certain person or body of\r\npersons must not be _habitually_ obedient to a certain person or body.\r\nAll the italicized words point to circumstances in which it might be\r\ndifficult to say whether a given society is political and independent or\r\nnot. Several of these Austin has discussed--e.g. the state of things in\r\nwhich a political society yields obedience which may or may not be\r\ncalled habitual to some external power, and the state of things in which\r\na political society is divided between contending claimants for\r\nsovereign power, and it is uncertain which shall prevail, and over how\r\nmuch of the society. So long as that uncertainty remains we have a state\r\nof _anarchy_. Further, an independent society to be political must not\r\nfall below a number which can only be called considerable. Neither then\r\nin a state of anarchy, nor in inconsiderable communities, nor among men\r\nliving in a state of nature, have we the proper phenomena of a political\r\nsociety. The last limitation goes some way to meet the most serious\r\ncriticism to which Austin's system has been exposed, and it ought to be\r\nstated in his own words. He supposes a society which may be styled\r\nindependent, which is considerable in numbers, and which is in a savage\r\nor extremely barbarous condition. In such a society, \"the bulk of its\r\nmembers is not in the habit of obedience to one and the same superior.\r\nFor the purpose of attacking an external enemy, or for the purpose of\r\nrepelling an attack, the bulk of its members who are capable of bearing\r\narms submits to one leader or one body of leaders. But as soon as that\r\nemergency passes the transient submission ceases, and the society\r\nreverts to the state which may be deemed its ordinary state. The bulk of\r\neach of the families which compose the given society renders habitual\r\nobedience to its own peculiar chief, but those domestic societies are\r\nthemselves independent societies, or are not united and compacted into\r\none political society by habitual and general obedience to one common\r\nsuperior, and there is no law (simply or strictly so styled) which can\r\nbe called the law of that society. The so-called laws which are common\r\nto the bulk of the community are purely and properly customary\r\nlaws--that is to say, laws which are set or imposed by the general\r\nopinion of the community, but are not enforced by legal or political\r\nsanctions.\" Such, he says, are the savage societies of hunters and\r\nfishers in North America, and such were the Germans as described by\r\nTacitus. He takes no account of societies in an intermediate stage\r\nbetween this and the condition which constitutes political society.\r\n\r\nWe need not follow the analysis in detail. Much ingenuity is displayed\r\nin grouping the various kinds of government, in detecting the sovereign\r\nauthority under the disguises which it wears in the complicated state\r\nsystem of the United States or under the fictions of English law, in\r\nelucidating the precise meaning of abstract political terms.\r\nIncidentally the source of many celebrated fallacies in political\r\nthought is laid bare. That the question who is sovereign in a given\r\nstate is a question of fact and not of law or morals or religion, that\r\nthe sovereign is incapable of legal limitation, that law is such by the\r\nsovereign's command, that no real or assumed compact can limit his\r\naction--are positions which Austin has been accused of enforcing with\r\nneedless iteration. He cleared them, however, from the air of paradox\r\nwith which they had been previously encumbered, and his influence was in\r\nno direction more widely felt than in making them the commonplaces of\r\neducated opinion in this generation.\r\n\r\nPassing from these, we may now consider what has been said against the\r\ntheory, which may be summed up in the following terms. Laws, no matter\r\nin what form they be expressed, are in the last resort reducible to\r\ncommands set by the person or body of persons who are in fact sovereigns\r\nin any independent political society. The sovereign is the person or\r\npersons whose commands are habitually obeyed by the great bulk of the\r\ncommunity; and by an independent society we mean that such sovereign\r\nhead is not himself habitually obedient to any other determinate body of\r\npersons. The society must be sufficiently numerous to be considerable\r\nbefore we can speak of it as a political society. From command, with its\r\ninseparable incident of sanction, come the duties and rights in terms of\r\nwhich laws are for the most part expressed. Duty means that the person\r\nof whom it is predicated is liable to the sanction in case he fails to\r\nobey the command. Right means that the person of whom it is predicated\r\nmay set the sanction in operation in case the command be disobeyed.\r\n\r\n  We may here interpolate a doubt whether the condition of independence\r\n  on the part of the head of a community is essential to the legal\r\n  analysis. It seems to us that we have all the elements of a true law\r\n  present when we point to a community habitually obedient to the\r\n  authority of a person or determinate body of persons, no matter what\r\n  the relations of that superior may be to any external or superior\r\n  power. Provided that in fact the commands of the lawgiver are those\r\n  beyond which the community never looks, it seems immaterial to inquire\r\n  whether this lawgiver in turn takes his orders from somebody else or\r\n  is habitually obedient to such orders when given. One may imagine a\r\n  community governed by a dependent legislatorial body or person, while\r\n  the supreme sovereign whose representative and nominee such body or\r\n  person may be never directly addresses the community at all. We do not\r\n  see that in such a case anything is gained in clearness by\r\n  representing the law of the community as set by the suzerain, rather\r\n  than the dependent legislator. Nor is the ascertainment of the\r\n  ultimate seat of power necessary to define political societies. That\r\n  we get when we suppose a community to be in the habit of obedience to\r\n  a single person or to a determinate combination of persons.\r\n\r\n  The use of the word \"command\" is not unlikely to lead to a\r\n  misconception of Austin's meaning. When we say that a law is a command\r\n  of the sovereign, we are apt to think of the sovereign as enunciating\r\n  the rule in question for the first time. Many laws are not traceable\r\n  to the sovereign at all in this sense. Some are based upon immemorial\r\n  practices, some can be traced to the influence of private citizens,\r\n  whether practising lawyers or writers on law, and in most countries a\r\n  vast body of law owes its existence as such to the fact that it has\r\n  been observed as law in some other society. The great bulk of modern\r\n  law owes its existence and its shape ultimately to the labours of the\r\n  Roman lawyers of the empire. Austin's definition has nothing to do\r\n  with this, the historical origin of laws. Most books dealing with law\r\n  in the abstract generalize the modes in which laws may be originated\r\n  under the name of the \"sources\" of law, and one of these is\r\n  legislation, or the direct command of the sovereign body. The\r\n  connexion of laws with each other as principles is properly the\r\n  subject matter of historical jurisprudence, the ideal perfection of\r\n  which would be the establishment of the general laws governing the\r\n  evolution of law in the technical sense. Austin's definition looks,\r\n  not to the authorship of the law as a principle, not to its inventor\r\n  or originator, but to the person or persons who in the last resort\r\n  cause it to be obeyed. If a given rule is enforced by the sovereign it\r\n  is a law.\r\n\r\n  It may be convenient to notice here what is usually said about the\r\n  sources of law, as the expression sometimes proves a stumbling-block\r\n  to the appreciation of Austin's system. In the _corpus juris_ of any\r\n  given country only a portion of the laws is traceable to the direct\r\n  expression of his commands by the sovereign. Legislation is one, but\r\n  only one, of the sources of law. Other portions of the law may be\r\n  traceable to other sources, which may vary in effect in different\r\n  systems. The list given in the _Institutes_ of Justinian of the ways\r\n  in which law may be made--_lex_, _plebiscitum_, _principis placita_,\r\n  _edicta magistratuum_, and so on--is a list of sources. Among the\r\n  sources of law other than legislation which are most commonly\r\n  exemplified are the laws made by judges in the course of judicial\r\n  decisions, and law originating as custom. The source of the law in the\r\n  one case is the judicial decision, in the other the custom. In\r\n  consequence of the decisions and in consequence of the custom the rule\r\n  has prevailed. English law is largely made up of principles derived in\r\n  each of those ways, while it is deficient in principles derived from\r\n  the writings of independent teachers, such as have in other systems\r\n  exercised a powerful influence on the development of law. The\r\n  _responsa prudentum_, the opinions of learned men, published as such,\r\n  did undoubtedly originate an immense portion of Roman law. No such\r\n  influence has affected English law to any appreciable extent--a result\r\n  owing to the activity of the courts of the legislature. This\r\n  difference has profoundly affected the form of English law as compared\r\n  with that of systems which have been developed by the play of free\r\n  discussion. These are the most definite of the influences to which the\r\n  beginning of laws may be traced. The law once established, no matter\r\n  how, is nevertheless law in the sense of Austin's definition. It is\r\n  enforced by the sovereign authority. It was originated by something\r\n  very different. But when we speak of it as a command we think only of\r\n  the way in which it is to-day presented to the subject. The newest\r\n  order of an act of parliament is not more positively presented to the\r\n  people as a command to be obeyed than are the elementary rules of the\r\n  common law for which no legislative origin can be traced. It is not\r\n  even necessary to resort to the figure of speech by which alone,\r\n  according to Sir Henry Maine (_Early History of Institutions_, p.\r\n  314), the common law can be regarded as the commands of the\r\n  government. \"The common law,\" he says, \"consists of their commands\r\n  because they can repeal or alter or restate it at pleasure.\" \"They\r\n  command because, being by the assumption possessed of uncontrollable\r\n  force, they could innovate without limit at any moment.\" On the\r\n  contrary, it may be said that they command because they do as a matter\r\n  of fact enforce the rules laid down in the common law. It is not\r\n  because they could innovate if they pleased in the common law that\r\n  they are said to command it, but because it is known that they will\r\n  enforce it as it stands.\r\n\r\nThe criticism of Austin's analysis resolved itself into two different\r\nsets of objections. One relates to the theory of sovereignty which\r\nunderlies it; the other to its alleged failure to include rules which in\r\ncommon parlance are laws, and which it is felt ought to be included in\r\nany satisfactory definition of law. As the latter is to some extent\r\nanticipated and admitted by Austin himself, we may deal with it first.\r\n\r\nFrederic Harrison (_Fortnightly Review_, vols. xxx., xxxi.) was at great\r\npains to collect a number of laws or rules of law which do not square\r\nwith the Austinian definition of law as a command creating rights and\r\nduties. Take the rule that \"every will must be in writing.\" It is a very\r\ncircuitous way of looking at things, according to Harrison, to say that\r\nsuch a rule creates a specific right in any determinate person of a\r\ndefinite description. So, again, the rule that \"a legacy to the witness\r\nof a will is void.\" Such a rule is not \"designed to give any one any\r\nrights, but simply to protect the public against wills made under undue\r\ninfluence.\" Again, the technical rule in Shelley's case that a gift to A\r\nfor life, followed by a gift to the heirs of A, is a gift to A in fee\r\nsimple, is pronounced to be inconsistent with the definition. It is an\r\nidle waste of ingenuity to force any of these rules into a form in which\r\nthey might be said to create rights.\r\n\r\nThis would be a perfectly correct description of any attempt to take any\r\nof these rules separately and analyse it into a complete command\r\ncreating specific rights and duties. But there is no occasion for doing\r\nanything of the kind. It is not contended that every grammatically\r\ncomplete sentence in a textbook or a statute is _per se_ a command\r\ncreating rights and duties. A law, like any other command, must be\r\nexpressed in words, and will require the use of the usual aids to\r\nexpression. The gist of it may be expressed in a sentence which,\r\nstanding by itself, is not intelligible; other sentences locally\r\nseparate from the principal one may contain the exceptions and the\r\nmodifications and the interpretations to which that is subject. In no\r\none of these taken by itself, but in the substance of them all taken\r\ntogether, is the true law, in Austin's sense, to be found. Thus the rule\r\nthat every will must be in writing is a mere fragment--only the limb of\r\na law. It belongs to the rule which fixes the rights of devisees or\r\nlegatees under a will. That rule in whatever form it may be expressed\r\nis, without any straining of language, a command of the legislator. That\r\n\"every person named by a testator in his last will and testament shall\r\nbe entitled to the property thereby given him\" is surely a command\r\ncreating rights and duties. After testament add \"expressed in writing\";\r\nit is still a command. Add further, \"provided he be not one of the\r\nwitnesses to the will,\" and the command, with its product of rights and\r\nduties, is still there. Each of the additions limits the operation of\r\nthe command stated imperatively in the first sentence. So with the rule\r\nin Shelley's case. It is resolvable into the rule that every person to\r\nwhom an estate is given by a conveyance expressed in such and such a way\r\nshall take such and such rights. To take another example from later\r\nlegislation. An English statute passed in 1881 enacts nothing more than\r\nthis, that an act of a previous session shall be construed as if \"that\"\r\nmeant \"this.\" It would be futile indeed to force this into conformity\r\nwith Austin's definition by treating it as a command addressed to the\r\njudges, and as indirectly creating rights to have such a construction\r\nrespected. As it happens, the section of the previous act referred to\r\n(the Burials Act 1880) was an undeniable command addressed to the\r\nclergy, and imposed upon them a specific duty. The true command--the\r\nlaw--is to be found in the two sections taken together.\r\n\r\nAll this confusion arises from the fact that laws are not habitually\r\nexpressed in imperative terms. Even in a mature system like that of\r\nEngland the great bulk of legal rules is hidden under forms which\r\ndisguise their imperative quality. They appear as principles, maxims,\r\npropositions of fact, generalizations, points of pleading and procedure,\r\nand so forth. Even in the statutes the imperative form is not uniformly\r\nobserved. It might be said that the more mature a legal system is the\r\nless do its individual rules take the form of commands. The greater\r\nportion of Roman law is expressed in terms which would not misbecome\r\nscientific or speculative treatises. The institutional works abound in\r\npropositions which have no legal significance at all, but which are not\r\ndistinguished from the true law in which they are embedded by any\r\ndifference in the forms of expression. Assertions about matters of\r\nhistory, dubious speculations in philology, and reflections on human\r\nconduct are mixed up in the same narrative with genuine rules of law.\r\nWords of description are used, not words of command, and rules of law\r\nassimilate themselves in form to the extraneous matter with which they\r\nare mixed up.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that Austin himself admitted to some extent the force\r\nof these objections. He includes among laws which are not imperative\r\n\"declaratory laws, or laws explaining the import of existing positive\r\nlaw, and laws abrogating or repealing existing positive law.\" He thus\r\nassociates them with rules of positive morality and with laws which are\r\nonly metaphorically so called. This collocation is unfortunate and out\r\nof keeping with Austin's method. Declaratory and repealing laws are as\r\ncompletely unlike positive morality and metaphorical laws as are the\r\nlaws which he describes as properly so called. And if we avoid the error\r\nof treating each separate proposition enunciated by the lawgiver as _a_\r\nlaw, the cases in question need give us no trouble. Read the declaratory\r\nand the repealing statutes along with the principal laws which they\r\naffect, and the result is perfectly consistent with the proposition that\r\nall law is to be resolved into a species of command. In the one case we\r\nhave in the principal taken together with the interpretative statute a\r\nlaw, and whether it differs or not from the law as it existed before the\r\ninterpretative statute was passed makes no difference to the true\r\ncharacter of the latter. It contributes along with the former to the\r\nexpression of a command which is a true law. In the same way repealing\r\nstatutes are to be taken together with the laws which they repeal--the\r\nresult being that there is no law, no command, at all. It is wholly\r\nunnecessary to class them as laws which are not truly imperative, or as\r\nexceptions to the rule that laws are a species of commands. The\r\ncombination of the two sentences in which the lawgiver has expressed\r\nhimself, yields the result of silence--absence of law--which is in no\r\nway incompatible with the assertion that a law, when it exists, is a\r\nkind of command. Austin's theory does not logically require us to treat\r\nevery act of parliament as being a complete law in itself, and therefore\r\nto set aside a certain number of acts of parliament as being exceptions\r\nto the great generalization which is the basis of the whole system.\r\n\r\nRules of procedure again have been alleged to constitute another\r\nexception. They cannot, it is said, be regarded as commands involving\r\npunishment if they be disobeyed. Nor is anything gained by considering\r\nthem as commands addressed to the judge and other ministers of the law.\r\nThere may be no doubt in the law of procedure a great deal that is\r\nresolvable into law in this sense, but the great bulk of it is to be\r\nregarded like the rules of interpretation as entering into the\r\nsubstantive commands which are laws. They are descriptions of the\r\nsanction and its mode of working. The bare prohibition of murder without\r\nany penalty to enforce it would not be a law. To prohibit it under\r\npenalty of death implies a reference to the whole machinery of criminal\r\njustice by which the penalty is enforced. Taken by themselves the rules\r\nof procedure are not, any more than canons of interpretation, complete\r\nlaws in Austin's sense of the term. But they form part of the complete\r\nexpression of true laws. They imply a command, and they describe the\r\nsanction and the mode in which it operates.\r\n\r\nA more formidable criticism of Austin's position is that which attacks\r\nthe definition of sovereignty. There are countries, it is said, where\r\nthe sovereign authority cannot by any stretch of language be said to\r\ncommand the laws, and yet where law manifestly exists. The ablest and\r\nthe most moderate statement of this view is given by Sir Henry Maine in\r\n_Early History of Institutions_, p. 380:--\r\n\r\n  \"It is from no special love of Indian examples that I take one from\r\n  India, but because it happens to be the most modern precedent in\r\n  point. My instance is the Indian province called the Punjaub, the\r\n  country of the Five Rivers, in the state in which it was for about a\r\n  quarter of a century before its annexation to the British Indian\r\n  Empire. After passing through every conceivable phase of anarchy and\r\n  dormant anarchy, it fell under the tolerably consolidated dominion of\r\n  a half-military half-religious oligarchy known as the Sikhs. The Sikhs\r\n  themselves were afterwards reduced to subjection by a single chieftain\r\n  belonging to their order, Runjeet Singh. At first sight there could be\r\n  no more perfect embodiment than Runjeet Singh of sovereignty as\r\n  conceived by Austin. He was absolutely despotic. Except occasionally\r\n  on his wild frontier he kept the most perfect order. He could have\r\n  commanded anything; the smallest disobedience to his commands would\r\n  have been followed by death or mutilation; and this was perfectly well\r\n  known to the enormous majority of his subjects. Yet I doubt whether\r\n  once in all his life he issued a command which Austin would call a\r\n  law. He took as his revenue a prodigious share of the produce of the\r\n  soil. He harried villages which recalcitrated at his exactions, and\r\n  he executed great numbers of men. He levied great armies; he had all\r\n  material of power, and he exercised it in various ways. But he never\r\n  made a law. The rules which regulated the lives of his subjects were\r\n  derived from their immemorial usages, and those rules were\r\n  administered by domestic tribunals in families or village\r\n  communities--that is, in groups no larger or little larger than those\r\n  to which the application of Austin's principles cannot be effected on\r\n  his own admission without absurdity.\"\r\n\r\nSo far as the mere size of the community is concerned, there is no\r\ndifficulty in applying the Austinian theory. In postulating a\r\nconsiderably numerous community Austin was thinking evidently of small\r\nisolated groups which could not without provoking a sense of the\r\nridiculous be termed nations. Two or three families, let us suppose,\r\noccupying a small island, totally disconnected with any great power,\r\nwould not claim to be and would not be treated as an independent\r\npolitical community. But it does not follow that Austin would have\r\nregarded the village communities spoken of by Maine in the same light.\r\nHere we have a great community, consisting of a vast number of small\r\ncommunities, each independent of the other, and disconnected with all\r\nthe others, so far as the administration of anything like law is\r\nconcerned. Suppose in each case that the headman or council takes his\r\norders from Runjeet Singh, and enforces them, each in his own sphere,\r\nrelying as the last resort on the force at the disposal of the suzerain.\r\nThe mere size of the separate communities would make no sort of\r\ndifference to Austin's theory. He would probably regard the empire of\r\nRunjeet Singh as divided into small districts--an assumption which\r\ninverts no doubt the true historical order, the smaller group being\r\ngenerally more ancient than the larger. But provided that the other\r\nconditions prevail, the mere fact that the law is administered by local\r\ntribunals for minute areas should make no difference to the theory. The\r\ncase described by Maine is that of the undoubted possession of supreme\r\npower by a sovereign, coupled with the total absence of any attempt on\r\nhis part to _originate_ a law. That no doubt is, as we are told by the\r\nsame authority, \"the type of all Oriental communities in their native\r\nstate during their rare intervals of peace and order.\" The empire was in\r\nthe main in each case a tax-gathering empire. The unalterable law of the\r\nMedes and Persians was not a law at all but an occasional command. So\r\nagain Maine puts his position clearly in the following sentences: \"The\r\nAthenian assembly made true laws for residents on Attic territory, but\r\nthe dominion of Athens over her subject cities and islands was clearly a\r\ntax-taking as distinguished from a legislating empire.\" Maine, it will\r\nbe observed, does not say that the sovereign assembly did not command\r\nthe laws in the subject islands--only that it did not legislate.\r\n\r\nIn the same category may be placed without much substantial difference\r\nall the societies that have ever existed on the face of the earth\r\nprevious to the point at which _legislation_ becomes active. Maine is\r\nundoubtedly right in connecting the theories of Bentham and Austin with\r\nthe overwhelming activity of legislatures in modern times. And formal\r\nlegislation, as he elsewhere shows, comes late in the history of most\r\nlegal systems. Law is generated in other ways, which seem irreconcilable\r\nwith anything like legislation. Not only the tax-gathering emperors of\r\nthe East, indifferent to the condition of their subjects, but even\r\nactively benevolent governments have up to a certain point left the law\r\nto grow by other means than formal enactments. What is _ex facie_ more\r\nopposed to the idea of a sovereign's commands than the conception of\r\nschools of law? Does it not \"sting us with a sense of the ridiculous\" to\r\nhear principles which are the outcome of long debates between Proculians\r\nand Sabinians described as commands of the emperor? How is sectarianism\r\nin law possible if the sovereign's command is really all that is meant\r\nby a law? No mental attitude is more common than that which regards law\r\nas a natural product--discoverable by a diligent investigator, much in\r\nthe same way as the facts of science or the principles of mathematics.\r\nThe introductory portions of Justinian's _Institutes_ are certainly\r\nwritten from this point of view, which may also be described without\r\nmuch unfairness as the point of view of German jurisprudence. And yet\r\nthe English jurist who accepts Austin's postulate as true for the\r\nEnglish system of our own day would have no difficulty in applying it to\r\nGerman or Roman law generated under the influence of such ideas as\r\nthese.\r\n\r\nAgain, referring to the instance of Runjeet Singh, Sir H. Maine says no\r\ndoubt rightly that \"he never did or could have dreamed of changing the\r\ncivil rules under which his subjects lived. Probably he was as strong a\r\nbeliever in the independent obligatory force of such rules as the elders\r\nthemselves who applied them.\" That too might be said with truth of\r\nstates to which the application of Austin's system would be far from\r\ndifficult. The sovereign body or person enforcing the rules by all the\r\nordinary methods of justice might conceivably believe that the rules\r\nwhich he enforced had an obligatory authority of their own, just as most\r\nlawyers at one time, and possibly some lawyers now, believe in the\r\nnatural obligatoriness, independently of courts or parliaments, of\r\nportions of the law of England. But nevertheless, whatever ideas the\r\nsovereign or his delegates might entertain as to \"the independent\r\nobligatory force\" of the rules which they enforce, the fact that they do\r\nenforce them distinguishes them from all other rules. Austin seizes upon\r\nthis peculiarity and fixes it as the determining characteristic of\r\npositive law. When the rule is enforced by a sovereign authority as he\r\ndefines it, it is his command, even if he should never so regard it\r\nhimself, or should suppose himself to be unable to alter it in a single\r\nparticular.\r\n\r\n  It may be instructive to add to these examples of dubious cases one\r\n  taken from what is called ecclesiastical law. In so far as this has\r\n  not been adopted and enforced by the state, it would, on Austin's\r\n  theory, be, not positive law, but either positive morality or possibly\r\n  a portion of the Divine law. No jurist would deny that there is an\r\n  essential difference between so much of ecclesiastical law as is\r\n  adopted by the state and all the rest of it, and that for scientific\r\n  purposes this distinction ought to be recognized. How near this kind\r\n  of law approaches to the positive or political law may be seen from\r\n  the sanctions on which it depended. \"The theory of penitential\r\n  discipline was this: that the church was an organized body with an\r\n  outward and visible form of government; that all who were outside her\r\n  boundaries were outside the means of divine grace; that she had a\r\n  command laid upon her, and authority given to her, to gather men into\r\n  her fellowship by the ceremony of baptism, but, as some of those who\r\n  were admitted proved unworthy of their calling, she also had the right\r\n  by the power of the keys to deprive them temporarily or absolutely of\r\n  the privilege of communion with her, and on their amendment to restore\r\n  them once more to church membership. On this power of exclusion and\r\n  restoration was founded the system of ecclesiastical discipline. It\r\n  was a purely spiritual jurisdiction. It obtained its hold over the\r\n  minds of men from the belief, universal in the Catholic church of the\r\n  early ages, that he who was expelled from her pale was expelled also\r\n  from the way of salvation, and that the sentence which was pronounced\r\n  by God's church on earth was ratified by Him in heaven.\" (Smith's\r\n  _Dictionary of Christian Antiquities_, art. \"Penitence,\" p. 1587.)\r\n\r\n  These laws are not the laws of the jurists, though they resemble them\r\n  closely in many points--indeed in all points except that of the\r\n  sanction by which they are enforced. It is a spiritual not a political\r\n  sanction. The force which lies behind them is not that of the\r\n  sovereign or the state. When physical force is used to compel\r\n  obedience to the laws of the church they become positive laws. But so\r\n  long as the belief in future punishments or the fear of the purely\r\n  spiritual punishments of the church is sufficient to procure obedience\r\n  to them, they are to be regarded as commands, not by the state, but by\r\n  the church. That difference Austin makes essential. In rejecting\r\n  spiritual laws from the field of positive law his example would be\r\n  followed by jurists who would nevertheless include other laws, not\r\n  ecclesiastical in purpose, but enforced by very similar methods.\r\n\r\nAustin's theory in the end comes to this, that true laws are in all\r\ncases obeyed in consequence of the application of regulated physical\r\nforce by some portion of the community. That is a fair paraphrase of the\r\nposition that laws are the commands of the sovereign, and is perhaps\r\nless objectionable inasmuch as it does not imply or suggest anything\r\nabout the forms in which laws are enunciated. All rules, customs,\r\npractices and laws--or by whatever name these uniformities of human\r\nconduct may be called--have either this kind of force at their back or\r\nthey have not. Is it worth while to make this difference the basis of a\r\nscientific system or not? Apparently it is. If it were a question of\r\ndistinguishing between the law of the law courts and the laws of\r\nfashion no one would hesitate. Why should laws or rules having no\r\nsupport from any political authority be termed laws positive merely\r\nbecause there are no other rules in the society having such support?\r\n\r\nThe question may perhaps be summed up as follows. Austin's definitions\r\nare in strict accordance with the facts of government in civilized\r\nstates; and, as it is put by Maine, certain assumptions or postulates\r\nhaving been made, the great majority of Austin's positions follow as of\r\ncourse or by ordinary logical process. But at the other extreme end of\r\nthe scale of civilization are societies to which Austin himself refuses\r\nto apply his system, and where, it would be conceded on all sides, there\r\nis neither political community nor sovereign nor law--none of the facts\r\nwhich jurisprudence assumes to exist. There is an intermediate stage of\r\nsociety in which, while the rules of conduct might and generally would\r\nbe spoken of as laws, it is difficult to trace the connexion between\r\nthem and the sovereign authority whose existence is necessary to\r\nAustin's system. Are such societies to be thrown out of account in\r\nanalytical jurisprudence, or is Austin's system to be regarded as only a\r\npartial explanation of the field of true law, and his definitions good\r\nonly for the laws of a portion of the world? The true answer to this\r\nquestion appears to be that when the rules in any given case are\r\nhabitually enforced by physical penalties, administered by a determinate\r\nperson or portion of the community, they should be regarded as positive\r\nlaws and the appropriate subject matter of jurisprudence. Rules which\r\nare not so enforced, but are enforced in any other way, whether by what\r\nis called public opinion, or spiritual apprehensions, or natural\r\ninstinct, are rightly excluded from that subject matter. In all stages\r\nof society, savage or civilized, a large body of rules of conduct,\r\nhabitually obeyed, are nevertheless not enforced by any state sanction\r\nof any kind. Austin's method assimilates such rules in primitive\r\nsociety, where they subserve the same purpose as positive laws in an\r\nadvanced society, not to the positive laws which they resemble in\r\npurpose but to the moral or other rules which they resemble in\r\noperation. If we refuse to accept this position we must abandon the\r\nattempt to frame a general definition of law and its dependent terms, or\r\nwe must content ourselves with saying that law is one thing in one state\r\nof society and another thing in another. On the ground of clearness and\r\nconvenience Austin's method is, we believe, substantially right, but\r\nnone the less should the student of jurisprudence be on his guard\r\nagainst such assumptions as that legislation is a universal phenomenon,\r\nor that the relation of sovereign and subject is discernible in all\r\nstates of human society. And a careful examination of Maine's criticism\r\nwill show that it is devoted not so much to a rectification of Austin's\r\nposition as to correction of the misconceptions into which some of his\r\ndisciples may have fallen. It is a misconception of the analysis to\r\nsuppose that it involves a difference in juridical character between\r\ncustom not yet recognized by any judicial decision and custom after such\r\nrecognition. There is no such difference except in the case of what is\r\nproperly called \"judicial legislation\"--wherein an absolutely new rule\r\nis added for the first time to the law. The recognition of a custom or\r\nlaw is not necessarily the beginning of the custom or law. Where a\r\ncustom possesses the marks by which its legality is determined according\r\nto well understood principles, the courts pronounce it to have been law\r\nat the time of the happening of the facts as to which their jurisdiction\r\nis invoked. The fact that no previous instance of its recognition by a\r\ncourt of justice can be produced is not material. A lawyer before any\r\nsuch decision was given would nevertheless pronounce the custom to be\r\nlaw--with more or less hesitation according as the marks of a legal\r\ncustom were obvious or not. The character of the custom is not changed\r\nwhen it is for the first time enforced by a court of justice, and hence\r\nthe language used by Maine must be understood in a very limited sense.\r\n\"Until customs are enforced by courts of justice\"--so he puts the\r\nposition of Austin--they are merely \"positive morality,\" rules enforced\r\nby opinion; but as soon as courts of justice enforce them they become\r\ncommands of the sovereign, conveyed through the judges who are his\r\ndelegates or deputies. This proposition, on Austin's theory, would only\r\nbe true of customs as to which these marks were absent. It is of course\r\ntrue that when a rule enforced only by opinion becomes for the first\r\ntime enforceable by a court of justice--which is the same thing as the\r\nfirst time of its being actually enforced--its juridical character is\r\nchanged. It was positive morality; it is now law. So it is when that\r\nwhich was before the opinion of the judge only becomes by his decision a\r\nrule enforceable by courts of justice. It was not even positive morality\r\nbut the opinion of an individual; it is now law.\r\n\r\nThe most difficult of the common terms of law to define is _right_; and,\r\nas right rather than duty is the basis of classification, it is a point\r\nof some importance. Assuming the truth of the analysis above discussed,\r\nwe may go on to say that in the notion of law is involved an obligation\r\non the part of some one, or on the part of every one, to do or forbear\r\nfrom doing. That obligation is duty; what is right? Dropping the\r\nnegative of forbearance, and taking duty to mean an obligation to do\r\nsomething, with the alternative of punishment in default, we find that\r\nduties are of two kinds. The thing to be done may have exclusive\r\nreference to a determinate person or class of persons, on whose motion\r\nor complaint the sovereign power will execute the punishment or sanction\r\non delinquents; or it may have no such reference, the thing being\r\ncommanded, and the punishment following on disobedience, without\r\nreference to the wish or complaint of individuals. The last are absolute\r\nduties, and the omission to do, or forbear from doing, the thing\r\nspecified in the command is in general what is meant by a crime. The\r\nothers are relative duties, each of them implying and relating to a\r\nright in some one else. A person has a right who may in this way set in\r\noperation the sanction provided by the state. In common thought and\r\nspeech, however, right appears as something a good deal more positive\r\nand definite than this--as a power or faculty residing in individuals,\r\nand suggesting not so much the relative obligation as the advantage or\r\nenjoyment secured thereby to the person having the right. J. S. Mill, in\r\na valuable criticism of Austin, suggests that the definition should be\r\nso modified as to introduce the element of \"advantage to the person\r\nexercising the right.\" But it is exceedingly difficult to frame a\r\npositive definition of right which shall not introduce some term at\r\nleast as ambiguous as the word to be defined. T. E. Holland defines\r\nright in general as a man's \"capacity of influencing the acts of another\r\nby means, not of his own strength, but of the opinion or the force of\r\nsociety.\" Direct influence exercised by virtue of one's own strength,\r\nphysical or otherwise, over another's acts, is \"might\" as distinguished\r\nfrom right. When the indirect influence is the opinion of society, we\r\nhave a \"moral right.\" When it is the force exercised by the sovereign,\r\nwe have a legal right. It would be more easy, no doubt, to pick holes in\r\nthis definition than to frame a better one.[2]\r\n\r\nThe distinction between rights available against determinate persons and\r\nrights available against all the world, _jura in personam_ and _jura in\r\nrem_, is of fundamental importance. The phrases are borrowed from the\r\nclassical jurists, who used them originally to distinguish actions\r\naccording as they were brought to enforce a personal obligation or to\r\nvindicate rights of property. The owner of property has a right to the\r\nexclusive enjoyment thereof, which avails against all and sundry, but\r\nnot against one person more than another. The parties to a contract have\r\nrights available against each other, and against no other persons. The\r\n_jus in rem_ is the badge of property; the _jus in personam_ is a mere\r\npersonal claim.\r\n\r\nThat distinction in rights which appears in the division of law into the\r\nlaw of persons and the law of things is thus stated by Austin. There are\r\ncertain rights and duties, with certain capacities and incapacities, by\r\nwhich persons are determined to various classes. The rights, duties,\r\n&c., are the condition or status of the person; and one person may be\r\ninvested with many status or conditions. The law of persons consists of\r\nthe rights, duties, &c., constituting conditions or status; the rest of\r\nthe law is the law of things. The separation is a mere matter of\r\nconvenience, but of convenience so great that the distinction is\r\nuniversal. Thus any given right may be exercised by persons belonging to\r\ninnumerable classes. The person who has the right may be under\r\ntwenty-one years of age, may have been born in a foreign state, may have\r\nbeen convicted of crime, may be a native of a particular county, or a\r\nmember of a particular profession or trade, &c.; and it might very well\r\nhappen, with reference to any given right, that, while persons in\r\ngeneral, under the circumstances of the case, would enjoy it in the same\r\nway, a person belonging to any one of these classes would not. If\r\nbelonging to any one of those classes makes a difference not to one\r\nright merely but to many, the class may conveniently be abstracted, and\r\nthe variations in rights and duties dependent thereon may be separately\r\ntreated under the law of persons. The personality recognized in the law\r\nof persons is such as modifies indefinitely the legal relations into\r\nwhich the individual clothed with the personality may enter.\r\n\r\nT. E. Holland disapproves of the prominence given by Austin to this\r\ndistinction, instead of that between public and private law. This,\r\naccording to Holland, is based on the public or private character of the\r\npersons with whom the right is connected, public persons being the state\r\nor its delegates. Austin, holding that the state cannot be said to have\r\nlegal rights or duties, recognizes no such distinction. The term \"public\r\nlaw\" he confines strictly to that portion of the law which is concerned\r\nwith political conditions, and which ought not to be opposed to the rest\r\nof the law, but \"ought to be inserted in the law of persons as one of\r\nthe limbs or members of that supplemental department.\"\r\n\r\nLastly, following Austin, the main division of the law of things is into\r\n(1) primary rights with primary relative duties, (2) sanctioning rights\r\nwith sanctioning duties (relative or absolute). The former exist, as it\r\nhas been put, for their own sake, the latter for the sake of the former.\r\nRights and duties arise from facts and events; and facts or events which\r\nare violations of rights and duties are _delicts_ or _injuries_. Rights\r\nand duties which arise from delicts are remedial or sanctioning, their\r\nobject being to prevent the violation of rights which do not arise from\r\ndelicts.\r\n\r\nThere is much to be said for Frederic Harrison's view (first expressed\r\nin the _Fortnightly Review_, vol. xxxi.), that the rearrangement of\r\nEnglish law on the basis of a scientific classification, whether\r\nAustin's or any other, would not result in advantages at all\r\ncompensating for its difficulties. If anything like a real code were to\r\nbe attempted, the scientific classification would be the best; but in\r\nthe absence of that, and indeed in the absence of any habit on the part\r\nof English lawyers of studying the system as a whole, the arrangement of\r\nfacts does not very much matter. It is essential, however, to the\r\nabstract study of the principles of law. Scientific arrangement might\r\nalso be observed with advantage in treatises affecting to give a view of\r\nthe whole law, especially those which are meant for educational rather\r\nthan professional uses. As an example of the practical application of a\r\nscientific system of classification to a complete body of law, we may\r\npoint to W. A. Hunter's elaborate _Exposition of Roman Law_ (1876).\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to present the conclusions of historical jurisprudence\r\nin anything like the same shape as those which we have been discussing.\r\nUnder the heading JURISPRUDENCE, COMPARATIVE, an account will be found\r\nof the method and results of what is practically a new science. The\r\ninquiry is in that stage which is indicated in one way by describing it\r\nas a philosophy. It resembles, and is indeed only part of, the study\r\nwhich is described as the philosophy of history. Its chief interest has\r\nbeen in the light which it has thrown upon rules of law and legal\r\ninstitutions which had been and are generally contemplated as positive\r\nfacts merely, without reference to their history, or have been\r\nassociated historically with principles and institutions not really\r\nconnected with them.\r\n\r\nThe historical treatment of law displaces some very remarkable\r\nmisconceptions. Peculiarities and anomalies abound in every legal\r\nsystem; and, as soon as laws become the special study of a professional\r\nclass, some mode of explaining or reconciling them will be resorted to.\r\nOne of the prehistorical ways of philosophizing about law was to account\r\nfor what wanted explanation by some theory about the origin of technical\r\nwords. This implied some previous study of words and their history, and\r\nis an instance of the deep-seated and persistent tendency of the human\r\nmind to identify names with the things they represent. The _Institutes_\r\nof Justinian abound in explanations, founded on a supposed derivation of\r\nsome leading term. _Testamentum_, we are told, _ex eo appellatur quod\r\ntestatio mentis est_. A testament was no doubt, in effect, a declaration\r\nof intention on the part of the testator when this was written. But the\r\n-_mentum_ is a mere termination, and has nothing to do with _mens_ at\r\nall. The history of testaments, which, it may be noted incidentally, has\r\nbeen developed with conspicuous success, gives a totally different\r\nmeaning to the institution from that which was expressed by this\r\nfanciful derivation. So the perplexing subject of _possessio_ was\r\nsupposed in some way to be explained by the derivation from _pono_ and\r\n_sedeo_--_quasi sedibus positio_. _Posthumi_ was supposed to be a\r\ncompound of _post_ and _humus_. These examples belong to the class of\r\nrationalizing derivations with which students of philosophy are\r\nfamiliar. Their characteristic is that they are suggested by some\r\nprominent feature of the thing as it then appeared to observers--which\r\nfeature thereupon becomes identified with the essence of the thing at\r\nall times and places.\r\n\r\nAnother prehistorical mode of explaining law may be described as\r\nmetaphysical. It conceives of a rule or principle of law as existing by\r\nvirtue of some more general rule or principle in the nature of things.\r\nThus, in the English law of inheritance, until the passing of the\r\nInheritance Act 1833, an estate belonging to a deceased intestate would\r\npass to his uncle or aunt, to the exclusion of his father or other\r\nlineal ancestor. This anomaly from an early time excited the curiosity\r\nof lawyers, and the explanation accepted in the time of Bracton was that\r\nit was an example of the general law of nature: \"Descendit itaque jus\r\nquasi ponderosum quid cadens deorsum recta linea vel transversali, et\r\nnunquam reascendit ea via qua descendit.\" It has been suggested that the\r\n\"rule really results from the associations involved in the word\r\ndescent.\" It seems more likely, however, that these associations\r\nexplained rather than that they suggested the rule--that the omission of\r\nthe lineal ancestor existed in custom before it was discovered to be in\r\nharmony with the law of nature. It would imply more influence than the\r\nreasoning of lawyers is likely to have exercised over the development of\r\nlaw at that time to believe that a purely artificial inference of this\r\nkind should have established so very remarkable a rule. However that may\r\nbe, the explanation is typical of a way of looking at law which was\r\ncommon enough before the dawn of the historical method. Minds capable of\r\nreasoning in this way were, if possible, farther removed from the\r\nconceptions implied in the reasoning of the analytical jurists than they\r\nwere from the historical method itself. In this connexion it may be\r\nnoticed that the great work of Blackstone marks an era in the\r\ndevelopment of legal ideas in England. It was not merely the first, as\r\nit still remains the only, adequate attempt to expound the leading\r\nprinciples of the whole body of law, but it was distinctly inspired by a\r\nrationalizing method. Blackstone tried not merely to express but to\r\nillustrate legal rules, and he had a keen sense of the value of\r\nhistorical illustrations. He worked of course with the materials at his\r\ncommand. His manner and his work are obnoxious alike to the modern\r\njurist and to the modern historian. He is accused by the one of\r\nperverting history, and by the other of confusing the law. But his\r\nscheme is a great advance on anything that had been attempted before;\r\nand, if his work has been prolific in popular fallacies, at all events\r\nit enriched English literature by a conspectus of the law, in which the\r\nlogical connexion of its principles _inter se_, and its relations to\r\nhistorical facts, were distinctly if erroneously recognized.\r\n\r\nWhile the historical method has superseded the verbal and metaphysical\r\nexplanation of legal principles, it had apparently, in some cases, come\r\ninto conflict with the conclusions of the analytical school. The\r\ndifference between the two systems comes out most conspicuously in\r\nrelation to customs. There is an unavoidable break in the analytical\r\nmethod between societies in which rules are backed by regulated physical\r\nforce and those in which no such force exists. At what point in its\r\ndevelopment a given society passes into the condition of \"an independent\r\npolitical society\" it may not be easy to determine, for the evidence is\r\nobscure and conflicting. To the historical jurist there is no such\r\nbreach. The rule which in one stage of society is a law, in another\r\nmerely a rule of \"positive morality,\" is the same thing to him\r\nthroughout. By the Irish Land Act 1881 the Ulster custom of tenant-right\r\nand other analogous customs were legalized. For the purposes of\r\nanalytical jurisprudence there is no need to go beyond the act of\r\nparliament. The laws known as the Ulster custom are laws solely in\r\nvirtue of the sovereign government. Between the law as it now is and the\r\ncustom as it existed before the act there is all the difference in the\r\nworld. To the historical jurist no such separation is possible. His\r\naccount of the law would not only be incomplete without embracing the\r\nprecedent custom, but the act which made the custom law is only one of\r\nthe facts, and by no means the most significant or important, in the\r\nhistory of its development. An exactly parallel case is the legalization\r\nin England of that customary tenant-right known as copyhold. It is to\r\nthe historical jurist exactly the same thing as the legalization of the\r\nUlster tenant right. In the one case a practice was made law by formal\r\nlegislation, and in the other without formal legislation. And there can\r\nbe very little doubt that in an earlier stage of society, when formal\r\nlegislation had not become the rule, the custom would have been\r\nlegalized relatively much sooner than it actually was.\r\n\r\nCustoms then are the same thing as laws to the historical jurist, and\r\nhis business is to trace the influences under which they have grown up,\r\nflourished and decayed, their dependence on the intellectual and moral\r\nconditions of society at different times, and their reaction upon them.\r\nThe recognized science--and such it may now be considered to be--with\r\nwhich historical, or more properly comparative, jurisprudence has most\r\nanalogy is the science of language. Laws and customs are to the one what\r\nwords are to the other, and each separate municipal system has its\r\nanalogue in a language. Legal systems are related together like\r\nlanguages and dialects, and the investigation in both cases brings us\r\nback at last to the meagre and obscure records of savage custom and\r\nspeech. A great master of the science of language (Max Müller) has\r\nindeed distinguished it from jurisprudence, as belonging to a totally\r\ndifferent class of sciences. \"It is perfectly true,\" he says, \"that if\r\nlanguage be the work of man in the same sense in which a statue, or a\r\ntemple, or a poem, or a law are properly called the works of man, the\r\nscience of language would have to be classed as an historical science.\r\nWe should have a history of language as we have a history of art, of\r\npoetry and of jurisprudence; but we could not claim for it a place side\r\nby side with the various branches of natural history.\" Whatever be the\r\nproper position of either philology or jurisprudence in relation to the\r\nnatural sciences, it would not be difficult to show that laws and\r\ncustoms on the whole are equally independent of the efforts of\r\nindividual human wills--which appears to be what is meant by language\r\nnot being the work of man. The most complete acceptance of Austin's\r\ntheory that law everywhere and always is the command of the sovereign\r\ndoes not involve any withdrawal of laws from the domain of natural\r\nscience, does not in the least interfere with the scientific study of\r\ntheir affinities and relationships. Max Müller elsewhere illustrates his\r\nconception of the different relations of words and laws to the\r\nindividual will by the story of the emperor Tiberius, who was reproved\r\nfor a grammatical mistake by Marcellus, whereupon Capito, another\r\ngrammarian, observed that, if what the emperor said was not good Latin,\r\nit would soon be so. \"Capito,\" said Marcellus, \"is a liar; for, Caesar,\r\nthou canst give the Roman citizenship to men, but not to words.\" The\r\nmere impulse of a single mind, even that of a Roman emperor, however,\r\nprobably counts for little more in law than it does in language. Even in\r\nlanguage one powerful intellect or one influential academy may, by its\r\nown decree, give a bent to modes of speech which they would not\r\notherwise have taken. But whether law or language be conventional or\r\nnatural is really an obsolete question, and the difference between\r\nhistorical and natural sciences in the last result is one of names.\r\n\r\nThe application of the historical method to law has not resulted in\r\nanything like the discoveries which have made comparative philology a\r\nscience. There is no Grimm's law for jurisprudence; but something has\r\nbeen done in that direction by the discovery of the analogous processes\r\nand principles which underlie legal systems having no external\r\nresemblance to each other. But the historical method has been applied\r\nwith special success to a single system--the Roman law. The Roman law\r\npresents itself to the historical student in two different aspects. It\r\nis, regarded as the law of the Roman Republic and Empire, a system whose\r\nhistory can be traced throughout a great part of its duration with\r\ncertainty, and in parts with great detail. It is, moreover, a body of\r\nrationalized legal principles which may be considered apart from the\r\nstate system in which they were developed, and which have, in fact,\r\nentered into the jurisprudence of the whole of modern Europe on the\r\nstrength of their own abstract authority--so much so that the continued\r\nexistence of the civil law, after the fall of the Empire, is entitled to\r\nbe considered one of the first discoveries of the historical method.\r\nAlike, therefore, in its original history, as the law of the Roman\r\nstate, and as the source from which the fundamental principles of modern\r\nlaws have been taken, the Roman law presented the most obvious and\r\nattractive subject of historical study. An immense impulse was given to\r\nthe history of Roman law by the discovery of the _Institutes_ of Gaius\r\nin 1816. A complete view of Roman law, as it existed three centuries and\r\na half before Justinian, was then obtained, and as the later\r\n_Institutes_ were, in point of form, a recension of those of Gaius, the\r\ncomparison of the two stages in legal history was at once easy and\r\nfruitful. Moreover, Gaius dealt with antiquities of the law which had\r\nbecome obsolete in the time of Justinian, and were passed over by him\r\nwithout notice.\r\n\r\nNowhere did Roman law in its modern aspect give a stronger impulse to\r\nthe study of legal history than in Germany. The historical school of\r\nGerman jurists led the reaction of national sentiment against the\r\nproposals for a general code made by Thibaut. They were accused by their\r\nopponents of setting up the law of past times as intrinsically entitled\r\nto be observed, and they were no doubt strongly inspired by reverence\r\nfor customs and traditions. Through the examination of their own\r\ncustomary laws, and through the elimination and separate study of the\r\nRoman element therein, they were led to form general views of the\r\nhistory of legal principles. In the hands of Savigny, the greatest\r\nmaster of the school, the historical theory was developed into a\r\nuniversal philosophy of law, covering the ground which we should assign\r\nseparately to jurisprudence, analytical and historical, and to theories\r\nof legislation. There is not in Savigny's system the faintest approach\r\nto the Austinian analysis. The range of it is not the analysis of law as\r\na command, but that of a _Rechtsverhältniss_ or legal relation. Far from\r\nregarding law as the creation of the will of individuals, he maintains\r\nit to be the natural outcome of the consciousness of the people, like\r\ntheir social habits or their language. And he assimilates changes in law\r\nto changes in language. \"As in the life of individual men no moment of\r\ncomplete stillness is experienced, but a constant organic development,\r\nsuch also is the case in the life of nations, and in every individual\r\nelement in which this collective life consists; so we find in language a\r\nconstant formation and development, and in the same way in law.\" German\r\njurisprudence is darkened by metaphysical thought, and weakened, as we\r\nbelieve, by defective analysis of positive law. But its conception of\r\nlaws is exceedingly favourable to the growth of a historical philosophy,\r\nthe results of which have a value of their own, apart altogether from\r\nthe character of the first principles. Such, for instance, is Savigny's\r\nfamous examination of the law of possession.\r\n\r\nThere is only one other system of law which is worthy of being placed by\r\nthe side of Roman law, and that is the law of England. No other European\r\nsystem can be compared with that which is the origin and substratum of\r\nthem all; but England, as it happens, is isolated in jurisprudence. She\r\nhas solved her legal problems for herself. Whatever element of Roman law\r\nmay exist in the English system has come in, whether by conscious\r\nadaptation or otherwise, _ab extra_; it is not of the essence of the\r\nsystem, nor does it form a large portion of the system. And, while\r\nEnglish law is thus historically independent of Roman law, it is in all\r\nrespects worthy of being associated with it on its own merits. Its\r\noriginality, or, if the phrase be preferred, its peculiarity, is not\r\nmore remarkable than the intellectual qualities which have gone to its\r\nformation--the ingenuity, the rigid logic, the reasonableness, of the\r\ngenerations of lawyers and judges who have built it up. This may seem\r\nextravagant praise for a legal system, the faults of which are and\r\nalways have been matter of daily complaint, but it would be endorsed by\r\nall unprejudiced students. What men complain of is the practical\r\nhardship and inconvenience of some rule or process of law. They know,\r\nfor example, that the law of real property is exceedingly complicated,\r\nand that, among other things, it makes the conveyance of land expensive.\r\nBut the technical law of real property, which rests to this day on ideas\r\nthat have been buried for centuries, has nevertheless the qualities we\r\nhave named. So too with the law of procedure as it existed under the\r\n\"science\" of special pleading. The greatest practical law reformer, and\r\nthe severest critic of existing systems that has ever appeared in any\r\nage or country, Jeremy Bentham, has admitted this: \"Confused,\r\nindeterminate, inadequate, ill-adapted, and inconsistent as to a vast\r\nextent the provision or no provision would be found to be that has been\r\nmade by it for the various cases that have happened to present\r\nthemselves for decision, yet in the character of a repository of such\r\ncases it affords, for the manufactory of real law, a stock of materials\r\nwhich is beyond all price. Traverse the whole continent of Europe,\r\nransack all the libraries belonging to all the jurisprudential systems\r\nof the several political states, add the contents together, you would\r\nnot be able to compose a collection of cases equal in variety, in\r\namplitude, in clearness of statement--in a word, all points taken\r\ntogether, in constructiveness--to that which may be seen to be afforded\r\nby the collection of English reports of adjudged cases\" (Bentham's\r\n_Works_, iv. 460). On the other hand, the fortunes of English\r\njurisprudence are not unworthy of comparison even with the catholic\r\nposition of Roman law. In the United States of America, in India, and in\r\nthe vast Colonial Empire, the common law of England constitutes most of\r\nthe legal system in actual use, or is gradually being superimposed upon\r\nit. It would hardly be too much to say that English law of indigenous\r\ngrowth, and Roman law, between them govern the legal relations of the\r\nwhole civilized world. Nor has the influence of the former on the\r\nintellectual habits and the ideas of men been much if at all inferior.\r\nThose who set any store by the analytical jurisprudence of the school of\r\nAustin will be glad to acknowledge that it is pure outcome of English\r\nlaw. Sir Henry Maine associated its rise with the activity of modern\r\nlegislatures, which is of course a characteristic of the societies in\r\nwhich English laws prevail. And it would not be difficult to show that\r\nthe germs of Austin's principles are to be found in legal writers who\r\nnever dreamed of analysing a law. It is certainly remarkable, at all\r\nevents, that the acceptance of Austin's system is as yet confined\r\nstrictly to the domain of English law. Maine found no trace of its being\r\neven known to the jurists of the Continent, and it would appear that it\r\nhas been equally without influence in Scotland, which, like the\r\ncontinent of Europe, is essentially Roman in the fundamental elements of\r\nits jurisprudence.\r\n\r\n  The substance of the above article is repeated from Professor E.\r\n  Robertson's (Lord Lochee's) article \"Law,\" in the 9th ed. of this\r\n  work.\r\n\r\n  Among numerous English textbooks, those specially worth mention are:\r\n  T. E. Holland, _The Elements of Jurisprudence_ (1880; 10th ed., 1906);\r\n  J. Austin, _Lectures on Jurisprudence_ (4th ed., 1873); W. Jethro\r\n  Brown, _The Austinian Theory of Law_ (1906); Sir F. Pollock, _A First\r\n  Book on Jurisprudence_ (1896; 2nd ed., 1904).\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] This appears to be an unnecessary complication. The sovereign has\r\n    authorized the master to set the law, although not compelling him to\r\n    do so, and enforces the law when set. There seems no good reason why\r\n    the law should be called a rule of positive morality at all.\r\n\r\n  [2] In English speech another ambiguity is happily wanting which in\r\n    many languages besets the phrase expressing \"a right.\" The Latin\r\n    \"jus,\" the German \"Recht,\" the Italian \"diritto,\" and the French\r\n    \"droit\" express, not only a right, but also law in the abstract. To\r\n    indicate the distinction between \"law\" and \"a right\" the Germans are\r\n    therefore obliged to resort to such phrases as \"objectives\" and\r\n    \"subjectives Recht,\" meaning by the former law in the abstract, and\r\n    by the latter a concrete right. And Blackstone, paraphrasing the\r\n    distinction drawn by Roman law between the \"jus quod ad res\" and the\r\n    \"jus quod ad personas attinet,\" devotes the first two volumes of his\r\n    _Commentaries_ to the \"Rights of Persons and the Rights of Things.\"\r\n    See Holland's _Elements of Jurisprudence_, 10th ed., 78 seq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJURISPRUDENCE, COMPARATIVE. The object of this article is to give a\r\ngeneral survey of the study of the evolution of law. It is not concerned\r\nwith analytical jurisprudence as a theory of legal thought, or an\r\nencyclopaedic introduction to legal teaching. Jurisprudence in such a\r\nphilosophic or pedagogical sense has certainly to reckon with the methods\r\nand results of a comparative study of law, but its aims are distinct from\r\nthose of the latter: it deals with more general problems. On the other\r\nhand, the comparative study of law may itself be treated in two different\r\nways: it may be directed to a comparison of existing systems of\r\nlegislation and law, with a view to tracing analogies and contrasts in\r\nthe treatment of practical problems and taking note of expedients and of\r\npossible solutions. Or else it may aim at discovering the principles\r\nregulating the development of legal systems, with a view to explain the\r\norigin of institutions and to study the conditions of their life. In the\r\nfirst sense, comparative jurisprudence resolves itself into a study of\r\nhome and foreign law (cf. Hofmann in the _Zeitschrift für das private und\r\nöffentliche Recht der Gegenwart_, 1878). In the second sense, comparative\r\njurisprudence is one of the aspects of so-called sociology, being the\r\nstudy of social evolution in the special domain of law. From this point\r\nof view it is, in substance, immaterial whether the legal phenomena\r\nsubjected to investigation are ancient or modern, are drawn from\r\ncivilized or from primitive communities. The fact that they are being\r\nobserved and explained as features of social evolution characterizes the\r\ninquiry and forms the distinctive attribute separating these studies from\r\nkindred subjects. It is only natural, however, that early periods and\r\nprimitive conditions have attracted investigators in this field more than\r\nrecent developments. The interest of students seems to have stood in\r\ninverse ratio to the chronological vicinity of the facts under\r\nconsideration--the farther from the observer, the more suggestive and\r\nworthy of attention the facts were found to be. This peculiarity is\r\neasily explained if we take into account the tendency of all evolutionary\r\ninvestigations to obtain a view of origins in order to follow up the\r\nthreads of development from their initial starting-point. Besides, it has\r\nbeen urged over and over again that the simpler phenomena of ancient and\r\nprimitive society afford more convenient material for generalizations as\r\nto legal evolution than the extremely complex legal institutions of\r\ncivilized nations. But there is no determined line of division between\r\nancient and modern comparative jurisprudence in so far as both are aiming\r\nat the study of legal development. The law of Islam or, for that matter,\r\nthe German civil code, may be taken up as a subject of study quite as\r\nmuch as the code of Hammurabi or the marriage customs of Australian\r\ntribes.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the comparative study of legal evolution is chiefly\r\nrepresented by investigations of early institutions is therefore a\r\ncharacteristic, but not a necessary feature in the treatment of the\r\nsubject. But it is essential to this treatment that it should be\r\n_historical_ and _comparative_. Historical, because it is only as\r\nhistory, i.e. a sequence of stages and events, that development can be\r\nthought of. Comparative, because it is not the casual notices about one\r\nor the other chain of historical facts that can supply the basis for any\r\nscientific induction. Comparisons of kindred processes have to be made\r\nin order to arrive at any conception of their general meaning and\r\nscientific regularity. As linguistic science differs from philology in\r\nso far as it treats of the general evolution of language and not of\r\nparticular languages, even so comparative jurisprudence differs from the\r\nhistory of law as a study of general legal evolution distinct from the\r\ndevelopment of one or the other national branch of legal enactment.\r\nNeedless to say that there are intermediate shades between these groups,\r\nbut it is not to these shades we have to attend, but to the main\r\ndistinctions and divisions.\r\n\r\n1. The idea that the legal enactments and customs of different\r\ncountries should be compared for the purpose of deducing general\r\nprinciples from them is as old as political science itself. It was\r\nrealized with especial vividness in epochs when a considerable material\r\nof observations was gathered from different sources and in various\r\nforms. The wealth of varieties and the recurrence of certain leading\r\nviews in them led to comparison and to generalizations based on\r\ncomparison. Aristotle, who lived at the close of a period marked by the\r\ngrowth of free Greek cities, summarized, as it were, their political\r\nexperience in his _Constitutions_ and _Politics_; students of these know\r\nthat the Greek philosopher had to deal with not only public law and\r\npolitical institutions, but also to some extent private, criminal law,\r\nequity, the relations between law and morals, &c.\r\n\r\nAnother great attempt at comparative observation was made at the close\r\nof the pre-revolutionary period of modern Europe. Montesquieu took stock\r\nof the analogies and contrasts of law in the commonwealths of his time\r\nand tried to show to what extent particular enactments and rules were\r\ndependent on certain general currents in the life of societies--on forms\r\nof government, on moral conditions corresponding to these, and\r\nultimately on the geographical facts with which various nationalities\r\nand states have to reckon in their development.\r\n\r\nThese were, however, only slight beginnings, general forecasts of a\r\ncoming line of thought, and Montesquieu's remarks on laws and legal\r\ncustoms read now almost as if they were meant to serve as materials for\r\nsocial Utopias, although they were by no means conceived in this sense.\r\nAt this distance of time we cannot help perceiving how fragmentary,\r\nincomplete and uncritical his notions of the facts of legal history\r\nwere, and how strongly his thought was biased by didactic\r\nconsiderations, by the wish to teach his contemporaries what politics\r\nand law should be.\r\n\r\nIt was reserved for the 19th century to come forward with connected and\r\nfar-reaching investigations in this field as in many others. We are not\r\ndeceived by proximity and self-consciousness when we affirm that\r\ncomparative jurisprudence, as understood in these introductory remarks,\r\ndates from the 19th century and especially from its second half.\r\n\r\nThere were many reasons for such a new departure: two of these reasons\r\nhave been especially manifest and decisive. The 19th century was an\r\neminently historical and an eminently scientific age. In the domain of\r\nhistory it may be said that it opened an entirely new vista. While,\r\nspeaking roughly, before that time history was conceived as a narrative\r\nof memorable events, more or less skilful, more or less sensational, but\r\nappealing primarily to the literary sense of the reader, it became in\r\nthe course of the 19th century an encyclopaedia of reasoned knowledge, a\r\nmeans of understanding social life by observing its phenomena in the\r\npast. The immense growth of historical scholarship in that sense, and\r\nthe transformation of its aims, can hardly be denied.\r\n\r\nApart from the personal efforts of eminent writers, a great and general\r\nmovement has to be taken into account in order to explain this\r\nremarkable stage of human thought. The historic bent of mind of\r\n19th-century thinkers was to a great extent the result of heightened\r\npolitical and cultural self-consciousness. It was the reflection in the\r\nworld of letters of the tremendous upheaval in the states of Europe and\r\nAmerica which took place from the close of the 18th century onwards. As\r\none of the greatest leaders of the movement, Niebuhr, pointed out, the\r\nfact of being a witness of such struggles and catastrophes as the\r\nAmerican Revolution, the French Revolution, the Napoleonic Empire and\r\nthe national reaction against it, taught every one to think\r\nhistorically, to appreciate the importance of historical factors, to\r\nmeasure the force not only of logical argument and moral impulse, but\r\nalso of instinctive habits and traditional customs. It is not a matter\r\nof chance that the _historical school_ of jurisprudence, Savigny's\r\ndoctrine of the organic growth of law, was formed and matured while\r\nEurope collected its forces after the most violent revolutionary crisis\r\nit had ever experienced, and in most intimate connexion with the\r\nromantic movement, a movement animated by enthusiastic belief in the\r\nhistorical, traditional life of social groups as opposed to the\r\nintellectual conceptions of individualistic radicalism.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the 19th century was a scientific age and especially\r\nan age of biological science. Former periods--the 16th and 17th\r\ncenturies especially--had bequeathed to it high standards of scientific\r\ninvestigation, an ever-increasing weight of authority in the direction\r\nof an exact study of natural phenomena and a conception of the world as\r\nruled by laws and not by capricious interference. But these scientific\r\nviews had been chiefly applied in the domain of mathematics, astronomy\r\nand physics; although great discoveries had already been made in\r\nphysiology and other branches of biology, yet the achievements of\r\n19th-century students in this respect far surpassed those of the\r\npreceding period. And the doctrine of transformation which came to\r\noccupy the central place in scientific thought was eminently fitted to\r\nco-ordinate and suggest investigations of social facts. As F. York\r\nPowell put it, Darwin is the greatest historian of modern times, and\r\ncertainly an historian not in the sense of a reader of annals, but in\r\nthat of a guide in the understanding of organic evolution. Though much\r\nis expressed in the one name of Darwin, it is perhaps even more\r\nmomentous as a symbol of the tendency of a great age than as a mark of\r\npersonal work. To this tendency we are indebted for the rise of\r\nanthropology and of sociology, of the scientific study of man and of the\r\nscientific study of society. Of course it ought not to be disregarded\r\nthat the application of scientific principles and methods to human and\r\nsocial facts was made possible by the growth of knowledge in regard to\r\nsavage and half-civilized nations called forth by the increased activity\r\nof European and American business men, administrators and explorers.\r\nEthnography and ethnology have brought some order into the wealth of\r\nmaterials accumulated by generations of workers in this direction, and\r\nit is with their help that the far-reaching generalizations of modern\r\ninquirers as to man and society have been achieved.\r\n\r\n2. It is not difficult to see that the comparative study of legal\r\nevolution finds its definite place in a scientific scheme elaborated\r\nfrom such points of view. Let us see how, as a matter of fact, the study\r\nin question arose and what its progress has been. The immediate\r\nincitement for the formation of comparative jurisprudence was given by\r\nthe great discoveries of comparative philology. When the labours of\r\nFranz Bopp, August Schleicher, Max Müller, W. D. Whitney and others\r\nrevealed the profound connexion between the different branches of the\r\nIndo-European race in regard to their languages, and showed that the\r\ndevelopment of these languages proceeded on lines which might be studied\r\nin a strictly scientific manner, on the basis of comparative observation\r\nand with the object of tracing the uniformities of the process, it was\r\nnatural that students of religion, of folk-lore and of legal\r\ninstitutions took up the same method and tried to win similar results\r\n(Sir H. Maine, Rede lecture in _Village Communities_, 3rd ed.).\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that one of the leading scholars of the\r\nGermanistic revival in the beginning of the 19th century, Jacob Grimm, a\r\ncompeer of Savigny in his own line, took up with fervent zeal and\r\nremarkable results not only the scientific study of the German language,\r\nbut also that of Germanic mythology and popular law. His\r\n_Rechtsalterthümer_ are still unrivalled as a collection of data as to\r\nthe legal lore of Teutonic tribes. Their basis is undoubtedly a narrow\r\none: they treat of the varieties of legal custom among the continental\r\nGermans, the Scandinavians and the Germanic tribes of Great Britain, but\r\nthe method of treatment is already a comparative one. Grimm takes up the\r\ndifferent subjects--property, contract, procedure, succession, crime,\r\n&c.--and examines them in the light of national, provincial and local\r\ncustoms, sometimes noticing expressly affinities with Roman and Greek\r\nlaw (e.g. the subject of imprisonment for debt, _Rechtsalterthümer_, 4th\r\ned., vol. ii., p. 165).\r\n\r\nA broader basis was taken up by a linguist who tried to trace the\r\nprimitive institutions and customs of the early Aryans before their\r\nseparation into divers branches. Adolphe Pictet (_Les Origines\r\nindo-européennes_, i. 1859; ii. 1863) had to touch constantly on\r\nquestions of family law, marriage, property, public authority, in his\r\nattempt to reconstruct the common civilization of the Aryan race, and he\r\ndid so on the strength of a comparative study of terms used in the\r\ndifferent Indo-European languages. He showed, for instance, how the idea\r\nof protection was the predominant element in the position of the father\r\nin the Aryan household. The names _pîtar_, _pater_, [Greek: patêr],\r\n_father_, which recur in most branches of the Aryan race, go back to a\r\nroot _pa_-, pointing to guardianship or protection. Thus we are led to\r\nconsider the _patria potestas_, so stringently formulated in Roman law,\r\nas an expression of a common Aryan notion, which was already in\r\nexistence before the Aryan tribes parted company and went their\r\ndifferent ways. Descriptions of Aryan early culture have been given\r\nseveral times since in connexion with linguistic observations. An\r\nexample is W. E. Hearn's _Aryan Household_ (1879). Fustel de Coulanges'\r\nfamous volume on the ancient city and Rudolf von Jhering's studies of\r\nprimitive Indo-European institutions (_Vorgeschichte der Indoeuropäer_)\r\nstart from similar observations, although the first of these scholars is\r\nchiefly interested in tracing the influence of religion on the material\r\narrangements of life, while the latter draws largely on principles of\r\npublic and private law, studied more especially in Roman antiquity.\r\n\r\n3. The chief work in that direction has been achieved in one sense by a\r\nGerman scholar, B. W. Leist. His Graeco-Roman legal history, his _Jus\r\nGentium of Primitive Aryans_, and his _Jus Civile of Primitive Aryans_,\r\nform the most complete and learned attempt not only to reconstitute the\r\nfundamental rules of common Aryan law before the separation of tongues\r\nand nations, but also to trace the influence of this original stock of\r\njuridical ideas in the later development of different branches of the\r\nAryan race. These three books present three stages of comparison, marked\r\nby a successive widening of the horizon. He began his legal history by\r\nputting together the data as to Roman and Greek legal origins; in the\r\n_Alt-arisches Jus Gentium_ the material of Hindu law is not only drawn\r\ninto the range of observation, but becomes its very centre; in the\r\n_Alt-arisches Jus Civile_ the legal customs of the Zend branch, of\r\nCelts, Germans and Slavs, are taken into account, although the most\r\nimportant part of the inquiry is still directed to the combination of\r\nHindu, Greek and Roman law. In this way Leist builds up his theories by\r\nthe comparative method, but he restricts its use consciously and\r\nconsistently to a definite range. He does not want to plunge into\r\nhaphazard analogies, but seeks common ground before all things in order\r\nto be able to watch for the appearance of ramifications and to explain\r\nthem. According to his view comparison is of use only between \"coherent\"\r\nlines of facts. Common origin, not similarity of features, appears to\r\nhim as the fundamental basis for fruitful comparison. It may be said\r\nthat Leist's work is characterized by the attempt to draw up a\r\ncontinuous history of a supposed archaic common law of the Aryan race\r\nrather than to put different solutions of kindred legal problems by the\r\nside of each other. For him Aryan tribal organization with its\r\ndouble-sided relationship--cognatic and agnatic--through men and through\r\nwomen--is one, and although he does not draw its picture as Fustel de\r\nCoulanges does by the help of traits taken indiscriminately from Hindu,\r\nRoman and Greek material, although he notices divisions, degrees and\r\nvariations, at bottom he writes the history of one set of principles\r\nexemplified and modulated, as it were, in the six or seven main\r\nvarieties of the race. Even so the nine rules of conduct prescribed by\r\nHindu sacral law are, according to his view, the directing rules of\r\nRoman, Greek, Germanic, Celtic, Slavonic legal custom--the duties in\r\nregard to gods, parents and fatherland, guests, personal purity, the\r\nprohibitions against homicide, adultery and theft--are variations of one\r\nand the same religious, moral and legal system, and their original unity\r\nis reflected and proved by the unity of legal terminology itself.\r\n\r\nThe same leading idea is embodied in the books of Otto\r\nSchräder--_Urgeschichte und Sprachvergleichung_ (1st ed., 1883; 2nd ed.,\r\n1890) and _Reallexikon der indogermanischen Altertumskunde_ (1901). In\r\nthis case we have to do not with a jurist but with a linguist and a\r\nstudent of cultural history. His training made him especially fit to\r\ntrace the national affinities in the data of language, and the sense of\r\nthe intimate connexion between the growth of institutions on one side,\r\nof words and linguistic forms on the other, underlies all his\r\ninvestigations. But Schrader testifies also to another powerful\r\ninfluence--to that of Victor Hehn, the author of a remarkable book on\r\nearly civilization, _Kulturpflanzen und Hausthiere in ihrem Übergang aus\r\nAsien in Europa_ (1st ed., 1870; 7th ed., 1902), dealing with the\r\nmigrations of tribes and their modes of acquiring material civilization.\r\nAlthough the linguistic and archaeological sides naturally predominate\r\nin Schrader's works, he has constantly to consider legal subjects, and\r\nhe strives conscientiously to obtain a clear and common-sense view of\r\nthe early legal notions of the Aryans. Speaking of the \"ordeals,\" the\r\n\"waging of God's law,\" for example, he traces the customs of\r\npurification by fire, water, iron, &c., to the practice of oaths (Sans.\r\n_am_; Gr. [Greek: omnymi]; O. Ital. _omr_ = first group; O. Ger. _aiþs_,\r\nIr. _óeth_ = second group; O. Norse _rota_, Arm. _erdnum_ = I swear =\r\nthird group). The central idea of the ordeal is thus shown to be the\r\nimprecation--\"Let him be cursed whose assertion is false.\"\r\n\r\nThe comparative study of the Aryan group assumed another aspect in the\r\nworks of Sir Henry Maine. He did not rely on linguistic affinities, but\r\nmade great use of another element of investigation which plays hardly\r\nany part in the books of the writers mentioned hitherto. His best\r\npersonal preparation for the task was that he had not only taught law in\r\nEngland, but had come into contact with living legal customs in India.\r\nFor him the comparison between the legal lore of Rome and that of India\r\ndid not depend on linguistic roots or on the philological study of the\r\nlaws of Manu, but was the result of recognizing again and again, in\r\nactual modern custom, the views, rules and institutions of which he had\r\nread in Gaius or in the fragments of the Twelve Tables. The sense of\r\nhistorical analogy and evolution which had shown itself already in the\r\nlectures on _Ancient Law_, which, after all, were mainly a presentment\r\nof Roman legal history mapped out by a man of the world, averse from\r\npedantic disquisitions. But what appears as the expression of Maine's\r\npersonal aptitude and intelligent reading in _Ancient Law_ gets to be\r\nthe interpretation of popular legal principles by modern as well as by\r\nancient instances of their application in _Village Communities_, _The\r\nEarly History of Institutions_, _Early Law and Custom_. The evolution of\r\nproperty in land out of archaic collectivism, ancient forms of contract\r\nand compulsion, rudimentary forms of feudalism and the like, were\r\ntreated in a new light in consequence of systematic comparisons with the\r\nconditions not only of India but of southern Slavonic nations, medieval\r\ncelts and Teutons. This breadth of view seemed startling when the\r\nlectures appeared, and the original treatment of the subject was hailed\r\non all sides as a most welcome new departure in the study of legal\r\ncustoms and institutions. And yet Maine set very definite boundaries to\r\nhis comparative surveys. He renounced the chronological limitation\r\nconfining such inquiries to the domain of antiquaries, but he upheld the\r\nethnographical limitation confining them to laws of the same race. In\r\nhis case it was the Aryan race, and in his _Law and Custom_ he opposed\r\nin a determined manner the attempts of more daring students to extend to\r\nthe Aryans generalizations drawn from the life of savage tribes\r\nunconnected with the Aryans by blood.\r\n\r\nThus, notwithstanding all diversities in the treatment of particular\r\nproblems, one leading methodical principle runs through the works of all\r\nthe above-mentioned exponents of comparative study. It was to proceed on\r\nthe basis of common origin and on the assumption of a certain common\r\nstock of language, religion, material culture, and law to start with.\r\nWhat Pictet, Leist, Schrader, and Maine were doing for the Aryans, F.\r\nHommel, Robertson Smith and others did in a lesser degree for the\r\nSemitic race.\r\n\r\n4. The literary group which started from the discoveries of comparative\r\nphilology and history was met on the way by what may be called the\r\nethnological school of inquirers. The original impetus was given, in\r\nthis case, by jurists and historians who took up the study in the field\r\nof ancient history, but treated it from the beginning in such a way as\r\nto break up the subdivisions of historic races and to direct the inquiry\r\nto a state of culture best illustrated by savage customs. The first\r\nimpulse may be said to have come from J. J. Bachofen (_Mutterrecht_,\r\n1861; _Antiquarische Briefe_, 1880; _Die Sage von Tanaquil_). All the\r\nrepresentatives of Aryan antiquities are at one in laying stress on the\r\npatriarchal and agnatic system of the kindreds in the different Aryan\r\nnations; even Leist, although dwelling on the importance of cognatic\r\nties, looks to agnatic relationship for the explanation of military\r\norganization and political authority. And undoubtedly, if we argue from\r\nthe predominant facts and from the linguistic evidence of parallel\r\nterms, we are led to assume that already before their separation the\r\nAryans lived in a patriarchal state of society. Now, Bachofen discovered\r\nin the very tradition of classical antiquity traces of a fundamentally\r\ndifferent state of things, the central conception of which was not\r\npatriarchal power, but maternity, relationship being traced through\r\nmothers, the wife presenting the constant and directing element of the\r\nhousehold, while the husband (and perhaps several husbands) joined her\r\nfrom time to time in more or less inconstant unions. Such a state of\r\nsociety is definitely described by Herodotus in the case of the Lycians,\r\nit is clearly noticeable even in later historical times in Sparta; the\r\npassage from this matriarchal conception to the recognition of the\r\nclaims of the father is reflected in poetical fiction in the famous\r\nOrestes myth, based on the struggle between the moral incitement which\r\nprompted the son to avenge his father and the absolute reverence for the\r\nmother required by ancient law. Although chiefly drawing his materials\r\nfrom classical literature, Bachofen included in his _Antiquarian\r\nLetters_ an interesting study of the marriage custom and systems of\r\nrelationship of the Malabar Coast in India; they attracted his attention\r\nby the contrasts between different layers of legal tradition--the\r\nBrahmans living in patriarchal order, while the class next to them, the\r\nNayirs (Nairs), follow rules of matriarchy.\r\n\r\nSimilar ideas were put forward in a more comprehensive form by J. F.\r\nMcLennan. His early volume (_Studies in Ancient History_, 1876) contains\r\nseveral essays published some time before that date. He starts from the\r\nwide occurrence of marriage by capture in primitive societies, and\r\ngroups the tribes of which we have definite knowledge into endogamous\r\nand exogamous societies according as they take their wives from among\r\nthe kindred or outside it. Marriage by capture and by purchase are signs\r\nof exogamy, connected with the custom in many tribes of killing female\r\noffspring. The development of marriage by capture and purchase is a\r\npowerful agent in bringing about patriarchal rule, agnatic relationship,\r\nand the formation of clans or _gentes_, but the more primitive forms of\r\nrelationship appear as variations of systems based on mother-right.\r\nThese views are supported by ethnological observations and used as a\r\nclue to the history of relationship and family law in ancient Greece. In\r\nfurther contributions published after McLennan's death these researches\r\nare supplemented and developed in many ways. The peculiarities of\r\nexogamous societies, for instance, are traced back to the even more\r\nprimitive practice of Totemism, the grouping of men according to their\r\nconceptions of animal worship and to their symbols. McLennan's line of\r\ninquiry was taken up in a very effective manner not only by\r\nanthropologists like E. B. Tylor or A. Lang, but also in a more special\r\nmanner by students of primitive family law. One of the most brilliant\r\nmonographs in this direction is Robertson Smith's study of _Kinship and\r\nMarriage in Arabia_.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the most decisive influence was exercised on the development\r\nof the ethnological study of law by the discoveries of an American,\r\nLewis H. Morgan. In his epoch-making works on _Systems of Consanguinity_\r\n(1869) and on _Ancient Society_ (1877) he drew attention to the\r\nremarkable fact that in the case of a number of tribes--the Red Indians\r\nof America, the Australian black tribes, some of the polar races, and\r\nseveral Asiatic tribes, mostly of Turanian race--degrees of relationship\r\nare reckoned and distinguished by names, not as ties between\r\nindividuals, but as ties between entire groups, classes or generations.\r\nInstead of a mother and a father a man speaks of fathers and mothers;\r\nall the individuals of a certain group are deemed husbands or wives of\r\ncorresponding individuals of another group; sisters and brothers have to\r\nbe sought in entire generations, and not among the descendants of a\r\ndefinite and common parent, and so forth. There are variations and types\r\nin these forms of organization, and intermediate links may be traced\r\nbetween unions of consanguine people--brothers and sisters of the same\r\nblood--on the one hand, and the monogamic marriage prevailing nowadays,\r\non the other; but the central and most striking fact seems to be that in\r\nearly civilizations, in conditions which we should attribute to savage\r\nand barbarian life, marriage appears as a tie, not between single pairs,\r\nbut between classes, all the men of a class being regarded as potential\r\nor actual husbands of the women of a corresponding class. Facts of this\r\nkind produce very peculiar and elaborate systems of relationship, which\r\nhave been copiously illustrated by Morgan in his tables. In his _Ancient\r\nSociety_ he attempted to reduce all the known forms and facts of\r\nmarriage and kinship arrangements to a comprehensive view of evolution\r\nleading up to the Aryan, Semitic and Uralian family, as exhibiting the\r\nmost modern type of relationship.\r\n\r\nThese observations, in conjunction with Bachofen's and McLennan's\r\nteaching on mother-right, brought about a complete change of perspective\r\nin the comparative study of man and society. The rights of ethnologists\r\nto have their say in regard to legal, political and social development\r\nwas forcibly illustrated from both ends, as it were. On the one hand,\r\nclassical antiquity itself proved to be a rather thin layer of human\r\ncivilization hardly sufficient to conceal the long periods of barbarism\r\nand primitive evolution which had gone to its making. On the other hand,\r\nunexpected combinations in regard to family, property, social order,\r\nwere discovered in every corner of the inhabited world, and our trite\r\nnotions as to the character of laws and institutions were reduced to the\r\nrank of variations on themes which recur over and over again, but may be\r\nand have been treated in very different ways.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to speak of the use made of ethnological material in\r\nthe wider range of anthropological and sociological studies--the works\r\nof Tylor, Lubbock, Lippert, Spencer are in everybody's hands--but\r\nattention must be called to the further influence of the ethnological\r\npoint of view in comparative jurisprudence. An interesting example of\r\nthe passage from one line of investigation to another, from the\r\nhistorical to the anthropological line, if the expression may be used\r\nfor the sake of brevity, is presented in the works of one of the\r\nfounders of the _Zeitschrift für vgl. Rechtswissenschaft_--Franz\r\nBernhöft. He appears in his earlier books as an exponent of the\r\ncomparative study of Greek and Roman antiquities, more or less in the\r\nstyle of Leist. Like the latter he was gradually incited to draw India\r\ninto the range of his observations, but unlike Leist, he ended by fully\r\nrecognizing the importance of ethnological evidence, and although he did\r\nnot do much original research in that direction himself, the influence\r\nof Bachofen and of the ethnologists made itself felt in Bernhöft's\r\ntreatment of classical antiquity itself: in his _State and Law in Rome\r\nat the Time of the Kings_ he starts from the view that patricians and\r\nplebeians represent two ethnological layers of society--a patriarchal\r\nAryan and a matriarchal pre-Aryan one.\r\n\r\nBut, of course, the utmost use was made of ethnological evidence by\r\nwriters who cut themselves entirely free from the special study of\r\nclassical or European antiquities. The enthusiasm of the explorers of\r\nnew territory led them naturally to disregard the peculiar claims of\r\nEuropean development in the history of higher civilization. They wanted\r\nmaterial for a study of the _genus homo_ in all its varieties, and they\r\nhad no time to look after the minute questions of philological and\r\nantiquarian research which had so long constituted the daily bread of\r\ninquirers into the history of laws. The most characteristic\r\nrepresentative of the new methods of extensive comparison was\r\nundoubtedly A. H. Post (1839-1895)--the author of many works, in which\r\nhe ranges over the whole domain of mankind--Hovas, Zulus, Maoris,\r\nTunguses, alternating in a kaleidoscopic fashion with Hindus, Teutons,\r\nJews, Egyptians. The order of his compositions is systematic, not\r\nchronological or even ethnographical in the sense of grouping kindred\r\nraces together. He takes up the different subdivisions of law and traces\r\nthem through all the various tribes which present any data in regard to\r\nthem. His method is not only not bound by history, it is opposed to it.\r\nHe writes:--\r\n\r\n  \"The method of comparative ethnology is different from the historical\r\n  method, inasmuch as it collects the given material from an entirely\r\n  distinct point of view. Historical investigation tries to get at the\r\n  causes of the facts of rational life by observing the development of\r\n  these facts from such as preceded them within the range of separate\r\n  kindreds, tribes and peoples. The investigation of comparative\r\n  ethnology inquires after the causes of facts in national life by\r\n  collecting identical or similar ethnological data wherever they may be\r\n  found in the world, and by drawing inferences from these materials to\r\n  identical or similar causes. This method is therefore _quite\r\n  unhistorical_. It severs things that have been hitherto regarded as\r\n  closely joined and arranges these shreds into new combinations\"\r\n  (_Grundriss_, i. 14).\r\n\r\nThis is not a mere paradox, but the necessary outcome of the situation\r\nin respect of the material used. What is being sought is not common\r\norigin or a common stock of ideas, but recourse to similar expedients in\r\nsimilar situations, and it is one of the most striking results of\r\nethnology that it can show how peoples entirely cut off from each other\r\nand even placed in very different planes of development can resort to\r\nanalogous solutions in analogous emergencies. Is not the custom of the\r\nso-called _Couvade_--the pretended confinement of the husband when a\r\nchild is born to his wife--a most quaint and seemingly recondite\r\nceremony? Yet we find it practised in the same way by Basques,\r\nCalifornian Indians, and some Siberian tribes. They have surely not\r\nborrowed from each other, nor have they kept the ceremony as a remnant\r\nof the time when they formed one race: in each case, evidently the\r\npassage from a matriarchal state to a patriarchal has suggested it, and\r\na very appropriate method it seems to establish the fact of fatherhood\r\nin a solemn and graphic though artificial manner. Again, an inscription\r\nfrom the Cretan town of Gortyn, published in the American _Journal of\r\nArchaeology_ (2nd series, vol. i., 1897) by Halbherr, tells us that the\r\nweapons of a warrior, the wool of a woman, the plough of a peasant,\r\ncould not be taken from them as pledges. We find a similar idea in the\r\nprohibition to take from a knight his weapons, from a villein his\r\nplough, in payment of fines, which obtained in medieval England and was\r\nactually inserted in Magna Carta. Here also the similarity extends to\r\ndetails, and is certainly not derived from direct borrowing or common\r\norigin but from analogies of situations translating themselves into\r\nanalogies of legal thought. It may be said in a sense that for the\r\nethnological school the less relationship there is between the compared\r\ngroups the more instructive the comparison turns out to be.\r\n\r\nThe collection of ethnological parallels for the use of sociology and\r\ncomparative jurisprudence has proceeded in a most fruitful manner. By\r\nthe side of special monographs about single tribes or geographical\r\ngroups of tribes, such as _Kamilaroi and Kurnai_, by L. Fison & A. W.\r\nHowitt (1880), and _The Native Tribes of Australia_, by Baldwin Spencer\r\n& F. G. Gillen (1899), the whole range of ethnological jurisprudence was\r\ngone through by Wilken in regard to the inhabitants of the Dutch\r\npossessions in Asia, by M. M. Kovalevsky in regard to Caucasians, &c. As\r\na rule the special monographs turned out to be more successful than the\r\ngeneral surveys, but the interest of the special monographs themselves\r\ndepended partly on the fact that people's eyes had been opened to the\r\nrecurrence of certain widespread phenomena and types of development.\r\n\r\n5. Ethnologists of Post's school have not had it entirely their own way,\r\nhowever. Not only did their natural opponents, the philologists,\r\nhistorians and jurists, reproach them with lack of critical\r\ndiscrimination, with a tendency to disregard fundamental distinctions,\r\nto wipe out characteristic features, to throw the most disparate\r\nelements into the same pot. In their own ranks a number of conscientious\r\nand scientifically trained investigators protested against the\r\nhaphazard manner in which the most intricate problems were treated, and\r\nsought to evolve more definite methodical rules. P. and F. Sarrasin in\r\ntheir description of the Ceylon Veddahs showed a most primitive race\r\nscattered in small clusters, monogamous and patriarchal in their\r\nmarriage customs and systems of relationship. E. A. Westermarck\r\nchallenged the sweeping generalizations indulged in by many ethnologists\r\nabout primitive promiscuity in sexual relations and the necessary\r\npassage of all human tribes through the stages of matriarchy and group\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nA very interesting departure was attempted by Dargun in his studies on\r\nthe origin and development of property and his treatise on mother-right\r\nand marriage by capture. His lead was followed by R. Hildebrand in the\r\nmonograph on law and custom. The principal idea of these inquirers may\r\nbe stated as follows. We must utilize ethnological as well as historical\r\nmaterials from the whole world, but it is no use doing this\r\nindiscriminately. Fruitful comparisons may be instituted mainly in the\r\ncase of tribes on the same level in their general culture and especially\r\ntheir economic pursuits. Hunting tribes must be primarily compared with\r\nother hunters, fishers with fishers, pastoral nations with pastoral\r\nnations, agriculturists with agriculturists; nations in transitional\r\nstages from one type of culture to the other have to be grouped and\r\nexamined by themselves. The result would be to establish certain\r\nparallel lines in the development of institutions and customs. From this\r\npoint of view both Dargun and Hildebrand attacked the prevailing theory\r\nof primitive communism and insisted on the atomistic individualism of\r\nthe rudimentary civilization of hunting tribes. Collectivism in the\r\ntreatment of ownership, common field husbandry, practices of joint\r\nholdings, co-aration, common stores, &c., make their appearance\r\naccording to Dargun in consequence of the drawing together of scattered\r\ngroups and smaller independent settlements. An evolution of the same\r\nkind leading from loose unions around mothers through marriage by\r\ncapture to patriarchal kindreds was traced in the history of\r\nrelationship. Grosse (_Die Formen der Familie und der Wirtschaft_, 1896)\r\nfollowed in a similar strain. Another line of criticism was opened up\r\nfrom the side of exact sociological study. Its best exponent is\r\nSteinmetz, who represents with Wilken the Dutch group of investigators\r\nof social phenomena. He takes up a standpoint which severs him entirely\r\nfrom the linguistic and historic school. In a discourse on the _Meaning\r\nof Sociology_ (p. 10) he expresses himself in the following words: \"One\r\nwho judges of the social state of the Hindus by the book of Manu takes\r\nthe ideal notions of one portion of the people for the actual conditions\r\nof all its parts.\" In regard to jurisprudence he distinguishes carefully\r\nbetween art and science. \"Jurisprudence in the wider sense is an art,\r\nthe art of framing rules for social intercourse in so far as these rules\r\ncan be put into execution by the state and its organs, as well as the\r\nart of interpreting and applying these rules. In another sense it is\r\npure science, the investigation of all consciously formulated and\r\nactually practised rules, and of their conditions and foundations, in\r\nfact of the entire social life of existing and bygone nations, without a\r\nknowledge and understanding of which a knowledge and understanding of\r\nlaw as its outcome is, of course, impossible.\" In this sense\r\njurisprudence is a part of ethnology and of the comparative history of\r\nculture. But in order to grapple with such a tremendous task comparative\r\njurisprudence has not only to call to help the study of scattered\r\nethnological facts. This is not sufficient to widen the frame of\r\nobservation and to realize the relative character of the principles with\r\nwhich practical lawyers operate, without ever putting in question their\r\ngeneral acceptance or logical derivations. Ethnological studies\r\nthemselves have to look for guidance to psychology, especially to the\r\npsychology of emotional life and of character. Although these branches\r\nof psychological science have been much less investigated than the study\r\nof intellectual processes, they still afford material help to the\r\nethnologist and the comparative jurist; and Steinmetz himself made a\r\nremarkable attempt to utilize a psychological analysis of the feelings\r\nof revenge in his _Origins of Punishment_.\r\n\r\n6. The necessity of employing more stringent standards of criticisms and\r\nmore exact methods is now recognized, and it is characteristic that the\r\nforemost contemporary representative of comparative jurisprudence,\r\nJoseph Kohler of Berlin, principal editor of the _Zeitschrift für vgl.\r\nRechtswissenschaft_, often gives expression to this view. Beginning with\r\nstudies of procedure and private law in the provinces of Germany where\r\nthe French law of the Code Napoléon was still applied, he has thrown his\r\nwhole energy into monographic surveys and investigations in all the\r\ndepartments of historical and ethnological jurisprudence. The code of\r\nKhammurabi and the Babylonian contracts, the ancient Hindu codes and\r\njuridical commentaries on them, the legal customs of the different\r\ntribes and provinces of India, the collection and sifting of the legal\r\ncustoms of aborigines in the German colonies in Africa, the materials\r\nsupplied by investigators of Australian and American tribes, the history\r\nof legal customs of the Mahommedans, and numberless other points of\r\nethnological research, have been treated by him in articles in his\r\n_Zeitschrift_ and in other publications. Comprehensive attempts have\r\nalso been made by him at a synthetic treatment of certain sides of the\r\nlaw--like the law of debt in his _Shakespeare vor dem Forum der\r\nJurisprudenz_ (1883) or his _Primitive History of Marriage_. Undoubtedly\r\nwe have not to deal in this case with mere accumulation of material or\r\nwith remarks on casual analogies. And yet the importance of these works\r\nconsists mainly in their extensive range of observation. The critical\r\nside is still on the second plane, although not conspicuously absent as\r\nin the case of Post and some of his followers. We may sympathize\r\ncordially with Kohler's exhortation to work for a universal history of\r\nlaw without yet perceiving clearly what the stages of this universal\r\nhistory are going to be. We may acknowledge the enormous importance of\r\nMorgan's and Bachofen's discoveries without feeling bound to recognize\r\nthat all tribes and nations of the earth have gone substantially through\r\nthe same forms of development in respect of marriage custom, and without\r\nadmitting that the evidence for a universal spread of group-marriage has\r\nbeen produced. Altogether the reproach seems not entirely unfounded that\r\ninvestigations of this kind are carried on too much under the sway of a\r\npreconceived notion that some highly peculiar arrangement entirely\r\ndifferent from what we are practising nowadays--say sexual promiscuity\r\nor communism in the treatment of property--must be made out as a\r\nuniversal clue to earlier stages of development. Kohler's occasional\r\nremarks on matters of method (e.g. _Zeitschift für vgl.\r\nRechtswissenschaft_, xii. 193 seq.) seem hardly adequate to dispel this\r\nimpression. But in his own work and in that of some of his compeers and\r\nfollowers, J. E. Hitzig, Hellwig, Max Huber, R. Dareste, more exact\r\nforms and means of inquiry are gradually put into practice, and the\r\nresults testify to a distinct heightening of the scientific standard in\r\nthis group of studies on comparative jurisprudence. Especially\r\nconspicuous in this respect are three tendencies: (a) the growing\r\ndisinclination to accept superficial analysis between phenomena\r\nbelonging to widely different spheres of culture as necessarily produced\r\nby identical causes (e.g. Darinsky's review of Kovalevsky's assumptions\r\nas to group marriage among the Caucasian tribes, _Z. für vgl. Rw._, xiv.\r\n151 seq.); (b) the selection of definite historical or ethnological\r\nterritories for monographic inquiries, in the course of which\r\narrangements observed elsewhere are treated as suggestive material for\r\nsupplying gaps and starting possible explanations: Kohler's own\r\ncontributions have been mainly of this kind; (c) the treatment of\r\nselected subjects by an intensive legal analysis, bringing out the\r\nprinciples underlying one or the other rule, its possible\r\ndifferentiation, the means of its application in practice, &c.:\r\nHellwig's monograph on the right of sanctuary in savage communities\r\n(_Das Asylrecht der Naturvölker_) may be named in illustration of this\r\nanalytical tendency. Altogether, there can be no doubt that the stage\r\nhas been reached by comparative jurisprudence when, after a hasty, one\r\nmight almost say a voracious consumption of materials, investigators\r\nbegin to strive towards careful sifting of evidence and a conscious\r\nexamination of methods and critical rules which have to be followed in\r\norder to make the investigations undertaken in this line worthy of\r\ntheir scientific aims. Until the latter has been done many students,\r\nwhose trend of thought would seem to lead them naturally into this\r\ndomain, may be repelled by the uncritical indistinctness with which mere\r\nanalogies are treated as elusive proofs by some of the representatives\r\nof the comparative school. F. W. Maitland, for instance, was always kept\r\nback by such considerations.\r\n\r\n7. It is desirable, in conclusion, to review the entire domain of\r\ncomparative jurisprudence, and to formulate the chief principles of\r\nmethod which have to be taken into consideration in the course of this\r\nstudy. It is evident, to begin with, that a scientific comparison of\r\nfacts must be directed towards two aims--towards establishing and\r\nexplaining similarity, and towards enumerating and explaining\r\ndifferences. As a matter of fact the same material may be studied from\r\nboth points of view, though logically these are two distinct processes.\r\n\r\n(a) Now at this initial stage we have already to meet a difficulty and\r\nto guard against a misconception: we have namely to reckon with the\r\n_plurality of causes_, and are therefore debarred from assuming that\r\nwherever similar phenomena are forthcoming they are always produced by\r\nidentical causes. Death may be produced by various agents--by sickness,\r\nby poison, by a blow. The habit of wearing mourning upon the death of a\r\nrelation is a widespread habit, and yet it is not always to be ascribed\r\nto real or supposed grief and the wish to express it in one's outward\r\nget-up. Savage people are known to go into mourning in order to conceal\r\nthemselves from the terrible spirit of the dead which would recognize\r\nthem in their everyday costume (Jhering, _Der Zweck im Recht_, 2nd ed.,\r\n1884-1886). This is certainly a momentous difficulty at the start, but\r\nit can be greatly reduced and guarded against in actual investigation.\r\nIn the example taken we are led to suppose different origin because we\r\nare informed as to the motives of the external ceremony, and thus we are\r\ntaught to look not only to bare facts, but to the psychological\r\nenvironment in which they appear. And it is evident that the greater the\r\ncomplexity of observed phenomena, the more they are made up of different\r\nelements welded into one sum, the less probability there is that we have\r\nto do with consequences derived from different causes. The recurrence of\r\ngroup-marriage in Australia and among the Red Indians of North America\r\ncan in no way be explained by the working of entirely different\r\nagencies. And it may be added that in most cases of an analysis of\r\nsocial institutions the limits of human probability and reasonable\r\nassumption do not coincide with mathematical possibility in any sense.\r\nWhen we register our facts and causes in algebraic forms, marking the\r\nfirst with _a_, _b_, _c_, and the latter with _x_, _y_, _z_, we are apt\r\nto demand a degree of precision which is hardly ever to be met with in\r\ndealing with social facts and causes. Let us rest content with\r\nreasonable inferences and probable explanations.\r\n\r\n(b) The easiest way of explaining a given similarity is by attributing\r\nit to a direct _loan_. The process of reception, of the borrowing of one\r\npeople from the other, plays a most notable part in the history of\r\ninstitutions and ideas. The Japanese have in our days engrafted many\r\nEuropean institutions on their perfectly distinct civilization; the\r\nGermans have used for centuries what was termed euphemistically the\r\nRoman law of the present time (_heutiges römisches Recht_); the Romans\r\nabsorbed an enormous amount of Greek and Oriental law in their famous\r\njurisprudence. A check upon explanation by direct loan will, of course,\r\nlie in the fact that two societies are entirely disconnected, so that it\r\ncomes to be very improbable that one drew its laws from the other.\r\nAlthough migrations of words, legends, beliefs, charms, have been shown\r\nby Theodor Benfey and his school to range over much wider areas than\r\nmight be supposed on the face of it, still, in the case of law, in so\r\nfar as it has to regulate material conditions, the limits have perhaps\r\nto be drawn rather narrowly. In any case we shall not look to India in\r\norder to explain the burning of widows among the negroes of Africa; the\r\n_suttee_ may be the example of this custom which happens to be most\r\nfamiliar to us, but it is certainly not the only root of it on the\r\nsurface of the earth.\r\n\r\nIt is much more difficult to make out the share of direct borrowing in\r\nthe case of peoples who might conceivably have influenced one another. A\r\nhard and fast rule cannot be laid down in such cases, and everything\r\ndepends on the weighing of evidence and sometimes on almost instinctive\r\nestimates. The use of a wager for the benefit of the tribunal in the\r\nearly procedure of the Romans and Greeks, the _sacramentum_ and the\r\n[Greek: prutaneia], with a similar growth of the sum laid down by the\r\nparties in proportion to the interests at stake, has been explained by a\r\ndirect borrowing by the Romans from the Greeks at the time of the Twelve\r\nTables legislation (Hofmann, _Beiträge zur Geschichte des griechischen\r\nund römischen Rechts_). No direct proof is available for this\r\nhypothesis, and the question in dispute might have lain for ever between\r\nthis explanation and that based on the analogous development in the two\r\nclosely related branches of law. The further study of the legal\r\nantiquities of other branches of the Aryan race leads one to suppose,\r\nhowever, that we have actually to do with the latter and not with the\r\nformer eventuality. Why should the popular custom of the _Vzdání_ in\r\nBohemia (Kapras, \"Das Pfandrecht in altböhmischen Landrecht,\" _Z. für\r\nvgl. R.-wissenschaft_, xvii. 424 seq.), regulating the wager of\r\nlitigation in the case of two parties submitting their dispute to the\r\ndecision of a public tribunal, turn out to be so similar to the Greek\r\nand the Roman process? And the Teutonic Wedde would further countenance\r\nthe view that we have to do in this case with analogous expediency or,\r\npossibly, common origin, not loans. But while dwelling on considerations\r\nwhich may disprove the assumption of direct loans, we must not omit to\r\nmention circumstances that may render such an assumption the best\r\navailable explanation for certain points of similarity. We mean\r\nespecially the recurrence of special secondary traits not deducible from\r\nthe nature of the relations compared. Terminological parallels are\r\nespecially convincing in such cases. An example of most careful\r\nlinguistic investigation attended by important results is presented by\r\nW. Thomsen's treatment of the affinities between the languages and\r\ncultures of the peoples of northern and eastern Europe. Taking the\r\nindications in regard to the influence of Germanic tribes on Finns and\r\nLapps, we find, for instance, that the Finnish race has stood for some\r\n1500 or 2000 years under \"the influence of several Germanic\r\nlanguages--partly of a more ancient form of Gothic than that represented\r\nby Ulfilas, partly of a northern (Scandinavian) tongue and even possibly\r\nof a common Gothic-northern one.\" The importance of these linguistic\r\ninvestigations for our subject becomes apparent when we find that a\r\nseries of most important legal and political terms has been imported\r\nfrom Teutonic into Finnish. For example, the Finnish _Kuningas_, \"king,\"\r\ncomes from a Germanic root illustrated by O. Norse _konung_, O. H. Ger.\r\n_chuning_, A.-S. _cyning_, Goth. _thiudans_. The Finnish _valta_,\r\n\"power,\" \"authority,\" is of Germanic origin, as shown by O. N. _vald_,\r\nGoth. _valdan_. The Finnish _kihla_, a compact secured by solemn\r\npromise, is akin with O. N. _gisl_, A.-S. _gisel_, O. H. Ger. _gisal_,\r\n\"hostage.\" The explanation for Finnish _vuokra_, \"interest,\" \"usury,\" is\r\nto be found in Gothic _vokrs_, O. N. _okr_, Ger. _Wucher_, &c. (W.\r\nThomsen, _Über den Einfluss der germanischen Sprachen auf die\r\nFinnisch-lappischen_, trans. E. Sievers, 1870, p. 166 seq.; cf. W.\r\nThomsen, _The Relations between Ancient Russia and Scandinavia and the\r\nOrigin of the Russian State_, p. 127 seq.; Miklosich, \"Die Fremdwörter\r\nin den slavischen Sprachen,\" _Denkschriften der Wiener Akademie_, Ph.\r\nhist. Klasse, XV.).\r\n\r\n(c) The next group of analogies is formed by cases which may be reduced\r\nto _common origin_. In addition to what has already been said on the\r\nsubject in connexion with the literature of the historical school, we\r\nmust point out that in the case of kindred peoples this form of\r\nderivation has, of course, to be primarily considered. This is\r\nespecially the case when we have to deal with the original stock of\r\ncultural notions of a race, and when analogies in the framing and\r\nworking of institutions and legal rules are supported by linguistic\r\naffinities. The testimony of the Aryan languages in regard to terms\r\ndenoting family organization and relationship can in no way be\r\ndisregarded, whatever our view may be about the most primitive stages\r\nof development in this respect. The fact that the common stock of Aryan\r\nlanguages and of Aryan legal customs points to a patriarchal\r\norganization of the family may be regarded as established, and it is\r\ncertainly an important fact drawn from a very ancient stage of human\r\nhistory, although there are indications that still more primitive\r\nformations may be discovered.\r\n\r\nInferences in the direction of common origin become more doubtful when\r\nwe argue, not that certain facts proceed from a common stock of notions\r\nembodied in the early culture of a race before it was broken up into\r\nseveral branches, but that they have to be accounted for as instances of\r\na similar treatment of legal problems by different peoples of the same\r\nethnic family. The only thing that can be said in such a case is that,\r\nmethodically, the customs of kindred nations have the first claim to\r\ncomparison. It is evident that in dealing with blood feud, composition\r\nfor homicide, and the like, among the Germans or Slavs, the evidence of\r\nother Aryan tribes has to be primarily studied. But it is by no means\r\nuseless for the investigator of these problems to inform himself about\r\nthe aspect of such customs in the life of nations of other descent, and\r\nespecially of savage tribes. The motives underlying legal rules in this\r\nrespect are to a large extent suggested by feelings and considerations\r\nwhich are not in any way peculiarly Aryan, and may be fully illustrated\r\nfrom other sources, as has been done e.g. in Steinmetz's _Origins of\r\nPunishment_.\r\n\r\n(d) This leads to the consideration of what maybe called _disconnected\r\nanalogies_. They are instructive in so far as they go back, not to any\r\ncontinuous development, but to the fundamental, psychological and\r\nlogical unity of human nature. In similar circumstances human beings are\r\nlikely to solve the same problems in the same way. Take a rather late\r\nand special case. In the Anglo-Saxon laws of Ine, a king who lived in\r\nthe 7th century, it is enacted that no landowner should be allowed to\r\nclaim personal labour service from his tenants unless he provides them\r\nnot merely with land, but with their homesteads. Now an exactly similar\r\nrule is found in the statement of rural by-laws to be enforced on great\r\ndomains in Africa, which had been taken over by the imperial fiscus--the\r\nLex Manciana (cf. Schulten, _Lex manciana_). There is absolutely no\r\nreason for assuming a direct transference of the rule from one place to\r\nthe other: it reflects considerations of natural equity which in both\r\ncases were directed against similar encroachments of powerful landowners\r\non a dependent peasant population. In both instances government\r\ninterfered to draw the line between the payment of rent and the\r\nperformance of labour, and fastened on the same feature to fix the\r\nlimit, namely, on the difference between peasants living in their own\r\nhomes and those who had been settled by the landowner on his farms. Of\r\nsuch analogies, the study of savage life presents a great number, e.g.\r\nthe widely spread practices of purification by ordeal (H. C. Lea,\r\n_Superstition and Force_).\r\n\r\n(e) Organizing thought always seeks to substitute order for chaotic\r\nvariety. Observations as to disconnected analogies lead to attempts to\r\nsystematize them from some comprehensive point of view. These attempts\r\nmay take the shape of a theory of _consecutive stages_ of development.\r\nSimilar facts appear over and over again in ethnological and antiquarian\r\nevidence, because all peoples and tribes, no matter what their race and\r\ngeographical position, go through the same series of social\r\narrangements. This is the fundamental idea which directed the researches\r\nof Maine, McLennan, Morgan, Post, Kohler, although each of these\r\nscholars formulated his sequence of stages in a peculiar way. McLennan,\r\nfor instance, puts the idea referred to in the following words:--\r\n\r\n  \"In short, it is suggested to us, that the history of human society is\r\n  that of a development following very slowly one general law, and that\r\n  the variety of forms of life--of domestic and civil institution--is\r\n  ascribable mainly to the unequal development of the different sections\r\n  of mankind.... The first thing to be done is to inform ourselves of\r\n  the facts relating to the least developed races. To begin with them is\r\n  to begin with history at the farthest-back point of time to which,\r\n  except by argument and inference, we can reach. Their condition, as\r\n  it may to-day be observed, is truly the most ancient condition of man\"\r\n  (_Studies in Ancient History_, 2nd series, 9, 15).\r\n\r\nOn this basis we might draw up tables of consecutive stages, of which\r\nthe simplest may be taken from Post:--\r\n\r\n  \"Four types of organization: the tribal, the territorial, the\r\n  seignorial, and the social. The first has as its basis marriage and\r\n  relationship by blood; the second, neighbouring occupation of a\r\n  district; the third, patronage relations between lord and dependants;\r\n  the fourth, social intercourse and contractual relations between\r\n  individual personalities\" (Post, _Grundriss_, i. 14).\r\n\r\nThis may be supplemented from Friedrichs in regard to initial stages of\r\nfamily organization. He reckons four stages of this kind: promiscuity,\r\nloose relations, matriarchal family, patriarchal family, modern,\r\nbilateral family (_Z. f. vgl. R. wissenschaft_). This mode of grouping\r\nsimilar phenomena as a sequence of stages leads to a conception of\r\nuniversal history of a peculiar kind. And as such it has been realized\r\nand advocated by Kohler (see e.g. his article in Helmolt's _World's\r\nHistory_, Eng. trans. i.). Prompted by this conception several\r\nrepresentatives of comparative jurisprudence have found no difficulty to\r\ninsert such a peculiar institution as group-marriage into the general\r\nand obligatory course of legal evolution. It is to be noticed, however,\r\nthat Kohler himself has entered a distinct protest against McLennan's\r\nand Post's view that the more rudimentary a people's culture is, the\r\nmore archaic it is, and the earlier it has to be placed in the natural\r\nsequence of evolution. This would create difficulties in the case of\r\ntribes of exceedingly low culture, like the Ceylon Veddahs, who live in\r\nmonogamous and patriarchal groups. According to Kohler's view, neither\r\nthe mere fact of a low standard of culture, nor the fact that a certain\r\nlegal custom precedes another in some cases in point of time, settles\r\nthe natural sequence of development. The process of development must be\r\nstudied in cases when it is sufficiently clear, gaps in other cases have\r\nto be supplied accordingly, and the working together of distinct\r\ninstitutions, especially in cases when there is no ethnic connexion has\r\nto be especially noticed. These are counsels of perfection, but Kohler's\r\nown example shows sufficiently that it is not easy to follow them to the\r\nletter. One thing is, however, clearly indicated by these and similar\r\ncriticisms; it is, at the least, premature to sketch anything like a\r\ncourse of universal development for legal history. We have grave doubts\r\nwhether the time will ever come for laying down any single course of\r\nthat kind. The attempts made hitherto have generally led to overstating\r\nthe value of certain parts of the evidence and to squeezing special\r\ntraits into a supposed general course of evolution.\r\n\r\n(f) Another group of thinkers is therefore content to systematize and\r\nexplain the material from the point of view, not of universal history,\r\nbut of _correspondence to economic stages and types_. This is, as we\r\nhave seen, the leading idea in Dargun's or Hildebrand's investigations.\r\nIt is needless to go into the question of the right or wrong of\r\nparticular suggestions made by these writers. The place assigned to\r\nindividualism and collectivism may be adequate or not; how far can be\r\nsettled only by special inquiries. But the general trend of study\r\ninitiated in this direction is certainly a promising one, if only one\r\nconsideration of method is well kept in view. Investigators ought to be\r\nvery chary of laying down certain combinations as the necessary outcome\r\nof certain economic situations. Such combinations or consequences\r\ncertainly exist; pastoral husbandry, the life of scattered hunting\r\ngroups, the conditions of agriculturists under feudal rule, certainly\r\ncontain elements which will recur in divers ethnical surroundings. But\r\nwe must not forget a feature which is constantly before our eyes in real\r\nlife: namely, that different minds and characters will draw different\r\nand perhaps opposite conclusions in exactly similar outward conditions.\r\nThis may happen in identical or similar geographical environment; let us\r\nonly think of ancient Greeks and Turks on the Balkan peninsula, or of\r\nancient Greeks and modern Greeks for that matter. But even the same\r\n_historical medium_ leaves, as a rule, scope for treatment of legal\r\nproblems on divers lines. Take systems of succession. They exercise the\r\nmost potent influence on the structure and life of society. Undivided\r\nsuccession, whether in the form of primogeniture or in that of junior\r\nright, sacrifices equity and natural affection to the economic\r\nefficiency of estates. Equal-partition rules, like _gavelkind_ or\r\n_parage_, lead in an exactly opposite direction. And yet both sets of\r\nrules coexisted among the agriculturists of feudal England; communities\r\nplaced in nearly identical historical positions followed one or the\r\nother of these rules. The same may be said of types of dwelling and\r\nforms of settlement. In other words, it is not enough to start from a\r\ngiven economic condition as if it were bound to regulate with fatalistic\r\nprecision all the incidents of legal custom and social intercourse. We\r\nhave to start from actual facts as complex results of many causes, and\r\nto try to reduce as much as we can of this material to the action of\r\neconomic forces in a particular stage or type of development.\r\n\r\n(g) The psychological diversities of mankind in dealing with the same or\r\nsimilar problems of food and property, of procreation and marriage, of\r\ncommon defence and relationship, of intercourse and contrast, &c., open\r\nanother possibility for the grouping of facts and the explanation of\r\ntheir evolution. It may be difficult or impossible to trace the reasons\r\nand causes of synthetic combinations in the history of society. That is,\r\nwe can hardly go beyond noting that certain disconnected features of\r\nsocial life appear together and react on each other. But it is easier\r\nand more promising to approach the mass of our material from the\r\n_analytical_ side, taking hold of certain principles, or rules, or\r\ninstitutions, and tracing them to their natural consequences either\r\nthrough a direct systematization of recorded facts or, when these fail,\r\nthrough logical inferences. Some of the most brilliant and useful work\r\nin the historical study of law has been effected on these lines.\r\nMommsen's theory of Roman magistracy, Jhering's theory of the struggle\r\nfor right, Kohler's view of the evolution of contract, &c., have been\r\nevolved by such a process of legal analysis; and, even when such\r\ngeneralizations have to be curtailed or complicated later on, they serve\r\ntheir turn as a powerful means of organizing evidence and suggesting\r\nreasonable explanations. The attribute of \"reasonableness\" has to be\r\nreckoned with largely in such cases. Analytical explanations are\r\nattractive to students because they substitute logical clearness for\r\nirrational accumulation of traits and facts. They do so to a large\r\nextent through appeals to the logic and to the reason common to us and\r\nto the people we are studying. This deductive element has to be closely\r\nwatched and tested from the side of a concrete study of the evidence,\r\nbut it seems destined to play a very prominent part in the comparative\r\nhistory of law, because legal analysis and construction have at all\r\ntimes striven to embody logic and equity in the domain of actual\r\ninterests and forces. And, as we have seen in our survey of the\r\nliterature of the subject, recent comparative studies tend to make the\r\nshare of juridical analysis in given relative surroundings larger and\r\nlarger. What is so difficult of attainment to single workers--a\r\nharmonious appreciation of the combined influences of common origin,\r\nreception of foreign custom, recurring psychological combinations, the\r\ndriving forces of economic culture and of the dialectical process of\r\nlegal thought, will be achieved, it may be hoped, by the enthusiastic\r\nand brotherly exertions of all the workers in the field.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--Of the principal works of reference may be mentioned:\r\n  _Zeitschrift für vergleichende Rechtswissenschaft_, edited by\r\n  Bernhöft, Cohn and Kohler (1878-   ); _Nouvelle revue historique de\r\n  droit français et étranger_, edited by Dareste, Esmein, Appert,\r\n  Fournier, Tardiff and Prou (1877-   ); A.

ABU BAKR 'ABDU-L-QAHIR IBN 'ABDUR-RAHMAN UL-JURJANI (d. 1078,)\r\nArabian grammarian, belonged to the Persian school and wrote a famous\r\ngrammar, the _Kitab ul-'Awamil ul-Mi'a or Kitab Mi'at 'Amil_, which was\r\nedited by Erpenius (Leiden, 1617), by Baillie (Calcutta, 1803), and by\r\nA. Lockett (Calcutta, 1814). Ten Arabic commentaries on this work exist\r\nin MS., also two Turkish. It has been versified five times and\r\ntranslated into Persian. Another of his grammatical works on which\r\nseveral commentaries have been written is the _Kitab Jumal fin-Nahw_.\r\n\r\n  For other works see C. Brockelmann's _Gesch. der Arabischen\r\n  Litteratur_ (1898), i. 288.\r\n\r\n2. 'ALI IBN MAHOMMED UL-JURJANI (1339-1414), Arabian encyclopaedic\r\nwriter, was born near Astarabad and became professor in Shiraz. When\r\nthis city was plundered by Timur (1387) he removed to Samarkand, but\r\nreturned to Shiraz in 1405, and remained there until his death. Of his\r\nthirty-one extant works, many being commentaries on other works, one of\r\nthe best known is the _Ta'rifat_ (_Definitions_), which was edited by G.\r\nFlügel (Leipzig, 1845), published also in Constantinople (1837), Cairo\r\n(1866, &c.), and St Petersburg (1897).     (G. W. T.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJURY, in English law, a body of laymen summoned and sworn (_jurati_) to\r\nascertain, under the guidance of a judge, the truth as to questions of\r\nfact raised in legal proceedings whether civil or criminal. The\r\ndevelopment of the system of trial by jury has been regarded as one of\r\nthe greatest achievements of English jurisprudence; it has even been\r\nsaid that the ultimate aim of the English constitution is \"to get twelve\r\ngood men into a box.\"[1] In modern times the English system of trial by\r\njury has been adopted in many countries in which jury trial was not\r\nnative or had been strangled or imperfectly developed under local\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the system in England has been much investigated by\r\nlawyers and historians. The result of these investigations is a fairly\r\ngeneral agreement that the germ of jury trial is to be found in the\r\nFrankish inquest (_recognitio_ or _inquisitio_) transplanted into\r\nEngland by the Norman kings. The essence of this inquest was the\r\nsummoning of a body of neighbours by a public officer to give answer\r\nupon oath (_recognoscere veritatem_) on some question of fact or law\r\n(_jus_), or of mixed fact and law. At the outset the object of the\r\ninquiry was usually to obtain information for the king, e.g. to\r\nascertain facts needed for assessing taxation. Indeed Domesday Book\r\nappears to be made up by recording the answers of inquests.\r\n\r\nThe origin of juries is very fully discussed in W. Forsyth's _History of\r\nTrial by Jury_ (1852), and the various theories advanced are more\r\nconcisely stated in W. Stubbs's _Constitutional History_ (vol. i.) and\r\nin E. A. Freeman's _Norman Conquest_ (vol. v.). Until the modern\r\nexamination of historical documents proved the contrary, the jury\r\nsystem, like all other institutions, was popularly regarded as the work\r\nof a single legislator, and in England it has been usually assigned to\r\nAlfred the Great. This supposition is without historical foundation, nor\r\nis it correct to regard the jury as \"copied from this or that kindred\r\ninstitution to be found in this or that German or Scandinavian land,\" or\r\nbrought over ready made by Hengist or by William.[2] \"Many writers of\r\nauthority,\" says Stubbs, \"have maintained that the entire jury system is\r\nindigenous in England, some deriving it from Celtic tradition based on\r\nthe principles of Roman law, and adopted by the Anglo-Saxons and Normans\r\nfrom the people they had conquered. Others have regarded it as a product\r\nof that legal genius of the Anglo-Saxons of which Alfred is the mythical\r\nimpersonation, or as derived by that nation from the customs of\r\nprimitive Germany or from their intercourse with the Danes. Nor even\r\nwhen it is admitted that the system of 'recognition' was introduced from\r\nNormandy have legal writers agreed as to the source from which the\r\nNormans themselves derived it. One scholar maintains that it was brought\r\nby the Norsemen from Scandinavia; another that it was derived from the\r\nprocesses of the canon law; another that it was developed on Gallic soil\r\nfrom Roman principles; another that it came from Asia through the\r\ncrusades,\" or was borrowed by the Angles and Saxons from their Slavonic\r\nneighbours in northern Europe. The true answer is that forms of trial\r\nresembling the jury system in various particulars are to be found in the\r\nprimitive institutions of all nations. That which comes nearest in time\r\nand character to trial by jury is the system of recognition by sworn\r\ninquest, introduced into England by the Normans. \"That inquest,\" says\r\nStubbs, \"is directly derived from the Frank capitularies, into which it\r\nmay have been adopted from the fiscal regulations of the Theodosian\r\ncode, and thus own some distant relationship with the Roman\r\njurisprudence.\" However that may be, the system of \"recognition\"\r\nconsisted in questions of fact, relating to fiscal or judicial business,\r\nbeing submitted by the officers of the crown to sworn witnesses in the\r\nlocal courts. Freeman points out that the Norman rulers of England were\r\nobliged, more than native rulers would have been, to rely on this system\r\nfor accurate information. They needed to have a clear and truthful\r\naccount of disputed points set before them, and such an account was\r\nsought for in the oaths of the recognitors.[3] The Norman conquest,\r\ntherefore, fostered the growth of those native germs common to England\r\nwith other countries out of which the institution of juries grew.\r\nRecognition, as introduced by the Normans, is only, in this point of\r\nview, another form of the same principle which shows itself in the\r\ncompurgators, in the _frith-borh_ (frank-pledge), in every detail of the\r\naction of the popular courts before the conquest. Admitting with Stubbs\r\nthat the Norman recognition was the instrument which the lawyers in\r\nEngland ultimately shaped into trial by jury, Freeman maintains none the\r\nless that the latter is distinctively English. Forsyth comes to\r\nsubstantially the same conclusion. Noting the jury germs of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon period, he shows how out of those elements, which continued\r\nin full force under the Anglo-Normans, was produced at last the\r\ninstitution of the jury. \"As yet it was only implied in the requirement\r\nthat disputed questions should be determined by the voice of sworn\r\nwitnesses taken from the neighbourhood, and deposing to the truth of\r\nwhat they had seen or heard.\" The conclusions of Sir F. Pollock and F.W.\r\nMaitland, expressed in their _History of English Law_, and based on a\r\ncloser study, are to the same effect.\r\n\r\nThis inquest then was a royal institution and not a survival from\r\nAnglo-Saxon law or popular custom, under which compurgation and the\r\nordeal were the accepted modes of trying issues of fact.\r\n\r\nThe inquest by recognition, formerly an inquest of office, i.e. to\r\nascertain facts in the interests of the crown or the exchequer, was\r\ngradually allowed between subjects as a mode of settling disputes of\r\nfact. This extension began with the assize of novel disseisin, whereby\r\nthe king protected by royal writ and inquest of neighbours every seisin\r\nof a freehold. This was followed by the grand assize, applicable to\r\nquestions affecting freehold or status. A defendant in such an action\r\nwas enabled by an enactment of Henry II. to decline trial by combat and\r\nchoose trial by assize, which was conducted as follows. The sheriff\r\nsummoned four knights of the neighbourhood, who being sworn chose the\r\ntwelve lawful knights most cognisant of the facts, to determine on their\r\noaths which had the better right to the land. If they all knew the facts\r\nand were agreed as to their verdict, well and good; if some or all were\r\nignorant, the fact was certified in court, and new knights were named,\r\nuntil twelve were found to be agreed. The same course was followed when\r\nthe twelve were not unanimous. New knights were added until the twelve\r\nwere agreed. This was called afforcing the assize. At this time the\r\nknowledge on which the jurors acted was their own personal knowledge,\r\nacquired independently of the trial. \"So entirely,\" says Forsyth, \"did\r\nthey proceed upon their own previously formed view of the facts in\r\ndispute that they seem to have considered themselves at liberty to pay\r\nno attention to evidence offered in court, however clearly it might\r\ndisprove the case which they were prepared to support.\" The use of\r\nrecognition is prescribed by the constitutions of Clarendon (1166) for\r\ncases of dispute as to lay or clerical tenure. See Forsyth, p. 131;\r\nStubbs, i. 617.\r\n\r\nThis procedure by the assize was confined to real actions, and while it\r\npreceded, it is not identical with the modern jury trial in civil cases,\r\nwhich was gradually introduced by consent of the parties and on pressure\r\nfrom the judges. Jury trial proper differs from the grand and petty\r\nassizes in that the assizes were summoned at the same time as the\r\ndefendant to answer a question formulated in the writ; whereas in the\r\nordinary jury trial no order for a jury could be made till the parties\r\nby their pleadings had come to an issue of fact and had put themselves\r\non the country, _posuerunt se super patriam_ (Pollock and Maitland, i.\r\n119-128; ii. 601, 615, 621).\r\n\r\n_The Grand Jury._--In Anglo-Saxon times there was an institution\r\nanalogous to the grand jury in criminal cases, viz. the twelve senior\r\nthegns, who, according to an ordinance of Æthelred II., were sworn in\r\nthe county court that they would accuse no innocent man and acquit no\r\nguilty one. The twelve thegns were a jury of presentment or accusation,\r\nlike the grand jury of later times, and the absolute guilt or innocence\r\nof those accused by them had to be determined by subsequent\r\nproceedings--by compurgation or ordeal. Whether this is the actual\r\norigin of the grand jury or not, the assizes of Clarendon (1166) and\r\nNorthampton (1176) establish the criminal jury on a definite basis.\r\n\r\nIn the laws of Edward the Confessor and the earlier Anglo-Saxon kings\r\nare found many traces of a public duty to bring offenders to justice,\r\nby hue and cry, or by action of the _frith-borh_, township, tithing or\r\nhundred. By the assize of Clarendon it is directed that inquiry be made\r\nin each county and in each hundred by twelve lawful (_legaliores_) men\r\nof the hundred, and by four lawful men from each of the four vills\r\nnearest to the scene of the alleged crime, on oath to tell the truth if\r\nin the hundred or vill there is any man accused (_rettatus aut\r\npublicatus_) as a robber or murderer or thief, or receiver of such. The\r\nassize of Northampton added forgery of coin or charters (_falsonaria_)\r\nand arson. The inquiry is to be held by the justices in eyre, and by the\r\nsheriffs in their county courts. On a finding on the oath aforesaid, the\r\naccused was to be taken and to go to the ordeal. By the articles of\r\nvisitation of 1194, four knights are to be chosen from the county who by\r\ntheir oath shall choose two lawful knights of each hundred or wapentake,\r\nor, if knights be wanting, free and legal men, so that the twelve may\r\nanswer for all matters within the hundred, including, says Stubbs, \"all\r\nthe pleas of the crown, the trial of malefactors and their receivers, as\r\nwell as a vast amount of civil business.\" The process thus described is\r\nnow regarded as an employment of the Frankish inquest for the collection\r\nof _fama publica_. It was alternative to the rights of a private accuser\r\nby appeal, and the inquest were not exactly either accusers or\r\nwitnesses, but gave voice to public repute as to the criminality of the\r\npersons whom they presented. From this form of inquest has developed the\r\ngrand jury of presentment or accusation, and the coroner's inquest,\r\nwhich works partly as a grand jury as to homicide cases, and partly as\r\nan inquest of office as to treasure trove, &c.\r\n\r\nThe number of the grand jury is fixed by usage at not less than twelve\r\nnor more than twenty-three jurors. Unanimity is not required, but twelve\r\nmust concur in the presentment or indictment.[4] This jury retains so\r\nmuch of its ancient character that it may present of its own knowledge\r\nor information, and is not tied down by rules of evidence. After a\r\ngeneral charge by the judge as to the bills of indictment on the file of\r\nthe court, the grand jury considers the bills in private and hears upon\r\noath in the grand jury chamber some or all the witnesses called in\r\nsupport of an indictment whose names are endorsed upon the bill. It does\r\nnot as a rule hear counsel or solicitors for the prosecution, nor does\r\nit see or hear the accused or his witnesses, and it is not concerned\r\nwith the nature of the defence, its functions being to ascertain whether\r\nthere is a prima facie case against the accused justifying his trial. If\r\nit thinks that there is such a case, the indictment is returned into\r\ncourt as a true bill; if it thinks that there is not, the bill is\r\nignored and returned into court torn up or marked \"no bill,\" or\r\n\"_ignoramus_.\" Inasmuch as no man can be put on trial for treason or\r\nfelony, and few are tried for misdemeanour, without the intervention of\r\nthe grand jury, the latter has a kind of veto with respect to criminal\r\nprosecutions. The grand jurors are described in the indictment as \"the\r\njurors for our lord the king.\" As such prosecutions in respect of\r\nindictable offences are now in almost all cases begun by a full\r\npreliminary inquiry before justices, and inasmuch as cases rarely come\r\nbefore a grand jury until after committal of the accused for trial, the\r\npresent utility of the grand jury depends very much on the character of\r\nthe justices' courts. As a review of the discretion of stipendiary\r\nmagistrates in committing cases for trial, the intervention of the grand\r\njury is in most cases superfluous; and even when the committing justices\r\nare not lawyers, it is now a common opinion that their views as to the\r\nexistence of a case to be submitted to a jury for trial should not be\r\nover-ridden by a lay tribunal sitting in private, and in this opinion\r\nmany grand jurors concur. But the abolition of the grand jury would\r\ninvolve great changes in criminal procedure for which parliament seems\r\nto have no appetite. Forsyth thinks that the grand jury will often\r\nbaffle \"the attempts of malevolence\" by ignoring a malicious and\r\nunfounded prosecution; but it may also defeat the ends of justice by\r\nshielding a criminal with whom it has strong political or social\r\nsympathies. The qualification of the grand jurymen is that they should\r\nbe freeholders of the county--to what amount appears to be\r\nuncertain--and they are summoned by the sheriff, or failing him by the\r\ncoroner.\r\n\r\nThe _coroner's jury_ must by statute (1887) consist of not more than\r\ntwenty-three nor less than twelve jurors. It is summoned by the coroner\r\nto hold an inquest _super visum corporis_ in cases of sudden or violent\r\ndeath, and of death in prisons or lunatic asylums, and to deal with\r\ntreasure trove. The qualification of the coroner's jurors does not\r\ndepend on the Juries Acts 1825 and 1870, and in practice they are drawn\r\nfrom householders in the immediate vicinity of the place where the\r\ninquest is held. Unanimity is not required of a coroner's jury; but\r\ntwelve must concur in the verdict. If it charges anyone with murder or\r\nmanslaughter, it is duly recorded and transmitted to a court of assize,\r\nand has the same effect as an indictment by a grand jury, i.e. it is\r\naccusatory only and is not conclusive, and is traversable, and the issue\r\nof guilt or innocence is tried by a petty jury.\r\n\r\n_The Petty Jury._--The ordeal by water or fire was used as the final\r\ntest of guilt or innocence until its abolition by decree of the Lateran\r\ncouncil (1219). On its abolition it became necessary to devise a new\r\nmode of determining guilt as distinguished from ill fame as charged by\r\nthe grand jury. So early as 1221 accused persons had begun to put\r\nthemselves on the country, or to pay to have a verdict for \"good or\r\nill\"; and the trial seems to have been by calling for the opinions of\r\nthe twelve men and the four townships, who may have been regarded as a\r\nsecond body of witnesses who could traverse the opinion of the hundred\r\njury. (See Pollock and Maitland, ii. 646.) The reference to _judicium\r\nparium_ in Magna Carta is usually taken to refer to the jury, but it is\r\nclear that what is now known as the petty jury was not then developed in\r\nits present form. \"The history of that institution is still in\r\nmanuscript,\" says Maitland.\r\n\r\nIt is not at all clear that at the outset the trial by the country (_in\r\npais_; _in patria_) was before another and different jury. The earliest\r\ninstances look as if the twelve men and the four vills were the _patria_\r\nand had to agree. But by the time of Edward I. the accused seems to have\r\nbeen allowed to call in a second jury. A person accused by the inquest\r\nof the hundred was allowed to have the truth of the charge tried by\r\nanother and different jury.[5] \"There is,\" says Forsyth, \"no possibility\r\nof assigning a date to this alteration.\" \"In the time of Bracton (middle\r\nof the 13th century) the usual mode of determining innocence or guilt\r\nwas by combat or appeal. But in most cases the appellant had the option\r\nof either fighting with his adversary or putting himself on his country\r\nfor trial\"--the exceptions being murder by secret poisoning, and certain\r\ncircumstances presumed by the law to be conclusive of guilt.[6] But the\r\nseparation must have been complete by 1352, in which year it was enacted\r\n\"that no indictor shall be put in inquests upon deliverance of the\r\nindictees of felonies or trespass if he be challenged for that same\r\ncause by the indictee.\"\r\n\r\nThe jurors, whatever their origin, differed from the Saxon doomsmen and\r\nthe jurats of the Channel Islands in that they adjudged nothing; and\r\nfrom compurgators or oath-helpers in that they were not witnesses\r\ncalled by a litigant to support his case (Pollock and Maitland, i. 118).\r\nOnce established, the jury of trial whether of actions or indictments\r\ndeveloped on the same lines. But at the outset this jury differed in one\r\nmaterial respect from the modern trial jury. The ancient trial jury\r\ncertify to the truth from their knowledge of the facts, however\r\nacquired. In other words, they resemble witnesses or collectors of local\r\nevidence or gossip rather than jurors. The complete withdrawal of the\r\nwitness character from the jury is connected by Forsyth with the ancient\r\nrules of law as to proof of written instruments, and a peculiar mode of\r\ntrial _per sectam_. When a deed is attested by witnesses, you have a\r\ndifference between the testimony of the witness, who deposes to the\r\nexecution of the deed, and the verdict of the jury as to the fact of\r\nexecution. It has been contended with much plausibility that in such\r\ncases the attesting witnesses formed part of the jury. Forsyth doubts\r\nthat conclusion, although he admits that, as the jurors themselves were\r\noriginally mere witnesses, there was no distinction in principle between\r\nthem and the attesting witnesses, and that the attesting witnesses might\r\nbe associated with the jury in the discharge of the function of giving a\r\nverdict. However that may be, in the reign of Edward III., although the\r\nwitnesses are spoken of \"as joined to the assize,\" they are\r\ndistinguished from the jurors. The trial _per sectam_ was used as an\r\nalternative to the assize or jury, and resembled in principle the system\r\nof compurgation. The claimant proved his case by vouching a certain\r\nnumber of witnesses (_secta_), who had seen the transaction in question,\r\nand the defendant rebutted the presumption thus created by vouching a\r\nlarger number of witnesses on his own side. In cases in which this was\r\nallowed, the jury did not interpose at all, but in course of time the\r\npractice arose of the witnesses of the _secta_ telling their story to\r\nthe jury. In these two instances we have the jury as judges of the facts\r\nsharply contrasted with the witnesses who testify to the facts; and,\r\nwith the increasing use of juries and the development of rules of\r\nevidence, this was gradually established as the true principle of the\r\nsystem. In the reign of Henry IV. we find the judges declaring that the\r\njury after they have been sworn should not see or take with them any\r\nother evidence than that which has been offered in open court. But the\r\npersonal knowledge of the jurors was not as yet regarded as outside the\r\nevidence on which they might found a verdict, and the stress laid upon\r\nthe selection of jurymen from the neighbourhood of the cause of the\r\naction shows that this element was counted on, and, in fact, deemed\r\nessential to a just consideration of the case. Other examples of the\r\nsame theory of the duties of the jury may be found in the language used\r\nby legal writers. Thus it has been said that the jury may return a\r\nverdict although no evidence at all be offered, and again, that the\r\nevidence given in court is not binding on the jury, because they are\r\nassumed from their local connexion to be sufficiently informed of the\r\nfacts to give a verdict without or in opposition to the oral evidence. A\r\nrecorder of London, _temp._ Edward VI., says that, \"if the witnesses at\r\na trial do not agree with the jurors, the verdict of the twelve shall be\r\ntaken and the witnesses shall be rejected.\" Forsyth suggests as a reason\r\nfor the continuance of this theory that it allowed the jury an escape\r\nfrom the _attaint_, by which penalties might be imposed on them for\r\ndelivering a false verdict in a civil case. They could suggest that the\r\nverdict was according to the fact, though not according to the evidence.\r\n\r\nIn England the trial jury (also called petty jury or traverse jury)\r\nconsists of twelve jurors, except in the county court, where the number\r\nis eight. In civil but not in criminal cases the trial may by consent be\r\nby fewer than twelve jurors, and the verdict may by consent be that of\r\nthe majority. The rule requiring a unanimous verdict has been variously\r\nexplained. Forsyth regards the rule as intimately connected with the\r\noriginal character of the jury as a body of witnesses, and with the\r\nconception common in primitive society that safety is to be found in the\r\nnumber of witnesses, rather than the character of their testimony. The\r\nold notion seems to have been that to justify an accusation, or to find\r\na fact, twelve sworn men must be agreed. The afforcing of the jury,\r\nalready described, marks an intermediate stage in the development. Where\r\nthe juries were not unanimous new jurors were added until twelve were\r\nfound to be of the same opinion. From the unanimous twelve selected out\r\nof a large number to the unanimous twelve constituting the whole jury\r\nwas a natural step, which, however, was not taken without hesitation. In\r\nsome old cases the verdict of eleven jurors out of twelve was accepted,\r\nbut it was decided in the reign of Edward III. that the verdict must be\r\nthe unanimous opinion of the whole jury. Diversity of opinion was taken\r\nto imply perversity of judgment, and the law sanctioned the application\r\nof the harshest methods to produce unanimity. The jurors while\r\nconsidering their verdict were not allowed a fire nor any refreshment,\r\nand it is said in some of the old books that, if they failed to agree,\r\nthey could be put in a cart and drawn after the justices to the border\r\nof the county, and then upset into a ditch. These rude modes of\r\nenforcing unanimity has been softened in later practice, but in criminal\r\ncases the rule of unanimity is still absolutely fixed.\r\n\r\nIn civil cases and in trials for misdemeanour, the jurors are allowed to\r\nseparate during adjournments and to return to their homes; in trials for\r\ntreason, treason-felony and murder, the jurors, once sworn, must not\r\nseparate until discharged. But by an act of 1897 jurors on trials for\r\nother felonies may be allowed by the court to separate in the same way\r\nas on trials for misdemeanour.\r\n\r\nThese rules do not apply to a jury which has retired to consider its\r\nverdict. During the period of retirement it is under the keeping of an\r\nofficer of the court.\r\n\r\nAt common law aliens were entitled to be tried by a jury _de medietate\r\nlinguae_--half Englishmen, half foreigners, not necessarily compatriots\r\nof the accused. This privilege was abolished by the Naturalization Act\r\n1870; but by the Juries Act 1870 aliens who have been domiciled in\r\nEngland or Wales for ten years or upwards, if in other respects duly\r\nqualified, are liable to jury service as if they were natural-born\r\nsubjects (s. 8).\r\n\r\nA jury of matrons is occasionally summoned, viz. on a writ _de ventre\r\ninspiciendo_, or where a female condemned to death pleads pregnancy in\r\nstay of execution.\r\n\r\nThe jurors are selected from the inhabitants of the county, borough or\r\nother area for which the court to which they are summoned is\r\ncommissioned to act. In criminal cases, owing to the rules as to venue\r\nand that crime is to be tried in the neighbourhood where it is\r\ncommitted, the mode of selection involves a certain amount of\r\nindependent local knowledge on the part of the jurors. Where local\r\nprejudice has been aroused for or against the accused, which is likely\r\nto affect the chance of a fair trial, the proceedings may be removed to\r\nanother jurisdiction, and there are a good many offences in which by\r\nlegislation the accused may be tried where he is caught, irrespective of\r\nthe place where he is alleged to have broken the law. As regards civil\r\ncases, a distinction was at an early date drawn between local actions\r\nwhich must be tried in the district in which they originated, and\r\ntransitory actions which could be tried in any county. These\r\ndistinctions are now of no importance, as the place of trial of a civil\r\naction is decided as a matter of procedure and convenience, and regard\r\nis not necessarily paid to the place at which a wrong was done or a\r\ncontract broken.\r\n\r\nThe qualifications for, and exemptions from, service as a petty juror\r\nare in the main contained in the Juries Acts 1825 and 1870, though a\r\nnumber of further exemptions are added by scattered enactments. The\r\nexemptions include members of the legislature and judges, ministers of\r\nvarious denominations, and practising barristers and solicitors,\r\nregistered medical practitioners and dentists, and officers and soldiers\r\nof the regular army. Persons over sixty are exempt but not disqualified.\r\nLists of the jurors are prepared by the overseers in rural parishes and\r\nby the town clerks in boroughs, and are submitted to justices for\r\nrevision. When jurors are required for a civil or criminal trial they\r\nare summoned by the sheriff or, if he cannot act, by the coroner.\r\n\r\n_Special and Common Juries._--For the purpose of civil trials in the\r\nsuperior courts there are two lists of jurors, special and common. The\r\npractice of selecting special jurors to try important civil cases\r\nappears to have sprung up, without legislative enactment, in the\r\nprocedure of the courts. Forsyth says that the first statutory\r\nrecognition of it is so late as 3 Geo. II. c. 25, and that in the oldest\r\nbook of practice in existence (Powell's _Attourney's Academy_, 1623)\r\nthere is no allusion to two classes of jurymen. The acts, however, which\r\nregulate the practice allude to it as well established. The Juries Act\r\n1870 (33 & 34 Vict. c. 77) defines the class of persons entitled and\r\nliable to serve on special juries thus: Every man whose name shall be on\r\nthe jurors' book for any county, &c., and who shall be legally entitled\r\nto be called an esquire, or shall be a person of higher degree, or a\r\nbanker or merchant, or who shall occupy a house of a certain rateable\r\nvalue (e.g. £100 in a town of 20,000 inhabitants, £50 elsewhere), or a\r\nfarm of £300 or other premises at £100. A special juryman receives a fee\r\nof a guinea for each cause. Either party may obtain an order for a\r\nspecial jury, but must pay the additional expenses created thereby\r\nunless the judge certifies that it was a proper case to be so tried. For\r\nthe common jury any man is qualified and liable to serve who has £10 by\r\nthe year in land or tenements of freehold, copyhold or customary tenure;\r\nor £20 on lands or tenement held by lease for twenty-one years or\r\nlonger, or who being a householder is rated at £30 in the counties of\r\nLondon and Middlesex, or £20 in any other county. A special jury cannot\r\nbe ordered in cases of treason or felony, and may be ordered in cases of\r\nmisdemeanour only when the trial is in the king's bench division of the\r\nHigh Court, or the civil side at assizes.\r\n\r\n_Challenge._--It has always been permissible for the parties to\r\nchallenge the jurors summoned to consider indictments or to try cases.\r\nBoth in civil and criminal cases a challenge \"for cause\" is allowed; in\r\ncriminal cases a peremptory challenge is also allowed. Challenge \"for\r\ncause\" may be either to the _array_, i.e. to the whole number of jurors\r\nreturned, or to the _polls_, i.e. to the jurors individually. A\r\nchallenge to the array is either a _principal_ challenge (on the ground\r\nthat the sheriff is a party to the cause, or related to one of the\r\nparties), or a challenge for _favour_ (on the ground of circumstances\r\nimplying \"at least a probability of bias or favour in the sheriff\"). A\r\nchallenge to the polls is an exception to one or more jurymen on either\r\nof the following grounds: (1) _propter honoris respectum_, as when a\r\nlord of parliament is summoned; (2) _propter defectum_, for want of\r\nqualification; (3) _propter affectum_, on suspicion of bias or\r\npartiality; and (4) _propter delictum_, when the juror has been\r\nconvicted of an infamous offence. The challenge _propter affectum_ is,\r\nlike the challenge to the array, either principal challenge or \"to the\r\nfavour.\" In England as a general rule the juror may be interrogated to\r\nshow want of qualification; but in other cases the person making the\r\nchallenge must prove it without questioning the juror, and the courts do\r\nnot allow the protracted examination on the _voir dire_ which precedes\r\nevery _cause célèbre_ in the United States. On indictments for treason\r\nthe accused has a right peremptorily to challenge thirty-five of the\r\njurors on the panel; in cases of felony the number is limited to twenty,\r\nand in cases of misdemeanour there is no right of peremptory challenge.\r\nThe Crown has not now the right of peremptory challenge and may\r\nchallenge only for cause certain (Juries Act 1825, s. 29). In the case\r\nof felony, on the first call of the list jurors objected to by the Crown\r\nare asked to stand by, and the cause of challenge need not be assigned\r\nby the Crown until the whole list has been perused or gone through, or\r\nunless there remain no longer twelve jurors left to try the case,\r\nexclusive of those challenged. This arrangement practically amounts to\r\ngiving the Crown the benefit of a peremptory challenge.\r\n\r\n_Function of Jury._--The jurors were originally the mouthpiece of local\r\nopinion on the questions submitted to them, or witnesses to fact as to\r\nsuch questions. They have now become the judges of fact upon the\r\nevidence laid before them. Their province is strictly limited to\r\nquestions of fact, and within that province they are still further\r\nrestricted to matters proved by evidence in the course of the trial and\r\nin theory must not act upon their own personal knowledge and observation\r\nexcept so far as it proceeds from what is called a \"view\" of the\r\nsubject matter of the litigation. Indeed it is now well established that\r\nif a juror is acquainted with facts material to the case, he should\r\ninform the court so that he may be dismissed from the jury and called as\r\na witness; and Lord Ellenborough ruled that a judge would misdirect the\r\njury if he told them that they might reject the evidence and go by their\r\nown knowledge. The old _decantatum_ assigns to judge and jury their own\r\nindependent functions: _Ad quaestionem legis respondent judices: ad\r\nquaestionem facti juratores_ (Plowden, 114). But the independence of the\r\njurors as to matters of fact was from an early time not absolute. In\r\ncertain civil cases a litigant dissatisfied by the verdict could adopt\r\nthe procedure by attaint, and if the attaint jury of twenty-four found\r\nthat the first jury had given a false verdict, they were fined and\r\nsuffered the villainous judgment. Attaints fell into disuse on the\r\nintroduction about 1665 of the practice of granting new trials when the\r\njury found against the weight of the evidence, or upon a wrong direction\r\nas to the law of the case.\r\n\r\nIn criminal cases the courts attempted to control the verdicts by fining\r\nthe jurors for returning a verdict _contra plenam et manifestam\r\nevidentiam_. But this practice was declared illegal in Bushell's case\r\n(1670); and so far as criminal cases are concerned the independence of\r\nthe jury as sole judges of fact is almost absolute. If they acquit,\r\ntheir action cannot be reviewed nor punished, except on proof of wilful\r\nand corrupt consent to \"embracery\" (Juries Act 1825, s. 61). If they\r\nconvict no new trial can be ordered except in the rare instances of\r\nmisdemeanours tried as civil cases in the High Court. In trials for\r\nvarious forms of libel during the 18th century, the judges restricted\r\nthe powers of juries by ruling that their function was limited to\r\nfinding whether the libel had in fact been published, and that it was\r\nfor the court to decide whether the words published constituted an\r\noffence.[7] By Fox's Libel Act 1792 the jurors in such cases were\r\nexpressly empowered to bring in a general verdict of libel or no libel,\r\ni.e. to deal with the whole question of the meaning and extent of the\r\nincriminated publication. In other words, they were given the same\r\nindependence in cases of libel as in other criminal cases. This\r\nindependence has in times of public excitement operated as a kind of\r\nlocal option against the existing law and as an aid to procuring its\r\namendment. Juries in Ireland in agrarian cases often acquit in the teeth\r\nof the evidence. In England the independence of the jury in criminal\r\ntrials is to some extent menaced by the provisions of the Criminal\r\nAppeal Act 1907.\r\n\r\nWhile the jury is in legal theory absolute as to matters of fact, it is\r\nin practice largely controlled by the judges. Not only does the judge at\r\nthe trial decide as to the relevancy of the evidence tendered to the\r\nissues to be proved, and as to the admissibility of questions put to a\r\nwitness, but he also advises the jury as to the logical bearing of the\r\nevidence admitted upon the matters to be found by the jury. The rules as\r\nto admissibility of evidence, largely based upon scholastic logic,\r\nsometimes difficult to apply, and almost unknown in continental\r\njurisprudence, coupled with the right of an English judge to sum up the\r\nevidence (denied to French judges) and to express his own opinion as to\r\nits value (denied to American judges), fetter to some extent the\r\nindependence or limit the chances of error of the jury.\r\n\r\n\"The whole theory of the jurisdiction of the courts to interfere with\r\nthe verdict of the constitutional tribunal is that the court is\r\nsatisfied that the jury have not acted reasonably upon the evidence but\r\nhave been misled by prejudice or passion\" (_Watt_ v. _Watt_ (1905), App.\r\nCas. 118, per Lord Halsbury). In civil cases the verdict may be\r\nchallenged on the ground that it is against the evidence or against the\r\nweight of the evidence, or unsupported by any evidence. It is said to be\r\nagainst the evidence when the jury have completely misapprehended the\r\nfacts proved and have drawn an inference so wrong as to be in substance\r\nperverse. The dissatisfaction of the trial judge with the verdict is a\r\npotent but not conclusive element in determining as to the perversity of\r\na verdict, because of his special opportunity of appreciating the\r\nevidence and the demeanour of the witnesses. But his opinion is less\r\nregarded now that new trials are granted by the court of appeal than\r\nunder the old system when the new trial was sought in the court of which\r\nhe was a member.\r\n\r\nThe appellate court will not upset a verdict when there is substantial\r\nand conflicting evidence before the jury. In such cases it is for the\r\njury to say which side is to be believed, and the court will not\r\ninterfere with the verdict. To upset a verdict on the ground that there\r\nis no evidence to go to the jury implies that the judge at the trial\r\nought to have withdrawn the case from the jury. Under modern procedure,\r\nin order to avoid the risk of a new trial, it is not uncommon to take\r\nthe verdict of a jury on the hypothesis that there was evidence for\r\ntheir consideration, and to leave the unsuccessful party to apply for\r\njudgment notwithstanding the verdict. The question whether there was any\r\nevidence proper to be submitted to the jury arises oftenest in cases\r\ninvolving an imputation of negligence--e.g. in an action of damages\r\nagainst a railway company for injuries sustained in a collision. Juries\r\nare somewhat ready to infer negligence, and the court has to say\r\nwhether, on the facts proved, there was any evidence of negligence by\r\nthe defendant. This is by no means the same thing as saying whether, in\r\nthe opinion of the court, there was negligence. The court may be of\r\nopinion that on the facts there was none, yet the facts themselves may\r\nbe of such a nature as to be evidence of negligence to go before a jury.\r\nWhen the facts proved are such that a reasonable man might have come to\r\nthe conclusion that there was negligence, then, although the court would\r\nnot have come to the same conclusion, it must admit that there is\r\nevidence to go before the jury. This statement indicates existing\r\npractice but scarcely determines what relation between the facts proved\r\nand the conclusion to be established is necessary to make the facts\r\nevidence from which a jury may infer the conclusion. The true\r\nexplanation is to be found in the principle of relevancy. Any fact which\r\nis relevant to the issue constitutes evidence to go before the jury, and\r\nany fact, roughly speaking, is relevant between which and the fact to be\r\nproved there may be a connexion as cause and effect (see EVIDENCE). As\r\nregards damages the court has always had wide powers, as damages are\r\noften a question of law. But when the amount of the damages awarded by a\r\njury is challenged as excessive or inadequate, the appellate court, if\r\nit considers the amount unreasonably large or unreasonably small, must\r\norder a new trial unless both parties consent to a reduction or increase\r\nof the damages to a figure fixed by the court; see _Watt_ v. _Watt_\r\n(1905), App. Cas. 115.\r\n\r\n_Value of Jury System._--The value of the jury in past history as a\r\nbulwark against aggression by the Crown or executive cannot be\r\nover-rated, but the working of the institution has not escaped\r\ncriticism. Its use protracts civil trials. The jurors are usually\r\nunwilling and are insufficiently remunerated; and jury trials in civil\r\ncases often drag out much longer and at greater expense than trials by a\r\njudge alone, and the proceedings are occasionally rendered ineffective\r\nby the failure of the jurors to agree.\r\n\r\nThere is much force in the arguments of Bentham and others against the\r\nneed of unanimity--the application of pressure to force conviction on\r\nthe minds of jurors, the indifference to veracity which the concurrence\r\nof unconvinced minds must produce in the public mind, the probability\r\nthat jurors will disagree and trials be rendered abortive, and the\r\nabsence of any reasonable security in the unanimous verdict that would\r\nnot exist in the verdict of a majority. All this is undeniably true, but\r\ndisagreements are happily not frequent, and whatever may happen in the\r\njury room no compulsion is now used by the court to induce agreement.\r\n\r\nBut, apart from any incidental defects, it may be doubted whether, as an\r\ninstrument for the investigation of truth, the jury system deserves all\r\nthe encomiums which have been passed upon it. In criminal cases,\r\nespecially of the graver kind, it is perhaps the best tribunal that\r\ncould be devised. There the element of moral doubt enters largely into\r\nthe consideration of the case, and that can best be measured by a\r\npopular tribunal. Opinion in England has hitherto been against\r\nsubjecting a man to serious punishment as a result of conviction before\r\na judge sitting without a jury, and the judges themselves would be the\r\nfirst to deprecate so great a responsibility, and the Criminal Appeal\r\nAct 1907, which constituted the court of criminal appeal, recognized the\r\nresponsibility by requiring a quorum of three judges in order to\r\nconstitute a court. The same act, by permitting an appeal to persons\r\nconvicted on indictment both on questions of fact and of law, removed to\r\na great extent any possibility of error by a jury. But in civil causes,\r\nwhere the issue must be determined one way or the other on the balance\r\nof probabilities, a single judge would probably be a better tribunal\r\nthan the present combination of judge and jury. Even if it be assumed\r\nthat he would on the whole come to the same conclusion as a jury\r\ndeliberating under his directions, he would come to it more quickly.\r\nTime would be saved in taking evidence, summing up would be unnecessary,\r\nand the addresses of counsel would inevitably be shortened and\r\nconcentrated on the real points at issue. Modern legislation and\r\npractice in England have very much reduced the use of the jury both in\r\ncivil and criminal cases.\r\n\r\nIn the county courts trial by jury is the exception and not the rule. In\r\nthe court of chancery and the admiralty court it was never used. Under\r\nthe Judicature Acts many cases which in the courts of common law would\r\nhave been tried with a jury are now tried before a judge alone, or\r\n(rarely) with assessors, or before an official referee. Indeed cynics\r\nsay that a jury is insisted on chiefly in cases when a jury, from\r\nprejudice or other causes, is likely to be more favourable than a judge\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nIn criminal cases, by reason of the enormous number of offences\r\npunishable on summary conviction and of the provisions made for trying\r\ncertain indictable offences summarily if the offender is young or elects\r\nfor summary trial, juries are less called on in proportion to the number\r\nof offences committed than was the practice in former years.\r\n\r\n  _Scotland._--According to the _Regiam Majestatem_, which is identical\r\n  with the treatise of Glanvill on the law of England (but whether the\r\n  original or only a copy of that work is disputed), trial by jury\r\n  existed in Scotland for civil and criminal cases from as early a date\r\n  as in England, and there is reason to believe that at all events the\r\n  system became established at a very early date. Its history was very\r\n  different from that of the English jury system. There was no grand\r\n  jury under Scots law, but it was introduced in 1708 for the purpose of\r\n  high treason (7 Anne c. 21). For the trial of criminal cases the petty\r\n  jury is represented by the criminal \"assize.\" This jury has always\r\n  consisted of fifteen persons and the jurors are chosen by ballot by\r\n  the clerk of the court from the list containing the names of the\r\n  special and common jurors, five from the special, ten from the common.\r\n  Prosecutor and accused each have five peremptory challenges, of which\r\n  two only may be directed against the special jurors; but there is no\r\n  limit to challenges for cause. The jury is not secluded during the\r\n  trial except in capital cases or on special order of the court made\r\n  _proprio motu_ or on the application of prosecutor or accused. The\r\n  verdict need not be unanimous, nor is enclosure a necessary\r\n  preliminary to a majority verdict. It is returned viva voce by the\r\n  chancellor or foreman, and entered on the record by the clerk of the\r\n  court, and the entry read to the jury. Besides the verdicts of\r\n  \"guilty\" and \"not guilty,\" a Scots jury may return a verdict of \"not\r\n  proven,\" which has legally the same effect as not guilty in releasing\r\n  the accused from further proceedings on the particular charge, but\r\n  inflicts on him the stigma of moral guilt.\r\n\r\n  Jury trial in civil cases was at one time in general if not prevailing\r\n  use, but was gradually superseded for most purposes on the institution\r\n  of the Court of Session (1 Mackay, _Ct. Sess. Pr._ 33). In this, as in\r\n  many other matters, Scots law and procedure tend to follow continental\r\n  rather than insular models. The civil jury was reintroduced in 1815\r\n  (55 Geo. III. c. 42), mainly on account of the difficulties\r\n  experienced by the House of Lords in dealing with questions of fact\r\n  raised on Scottish appeals. At the outset a special court was\r\n  instituted in the nature of a judicial commission to ascertain by\r\n  means of a jury facts deemed relevant to the issues in a cause and\r\n  sent for such determination at the discretion of the court in which\r\n  the cause was pending. The process was analogous to the sending of an\r\n  issue out of chancery for trial in a superior court of common law, or\r\n  in a court of assize. In 1830 the jury court ceased to exist as a\r\n  separate tribunal and was merged in the Court of Session. By\r\n  legislation of 1819 and 1823 certain classes of cases were indicated\r\n  as appropriate to be tried by a jury; but in 1850 the cases so to be\r\n  tried were limited to actions for defamation and nuisance, or properly\r\n  and in substance actions for damages, and under an act of 1866 even in\r\n  these cases the jury may be dispensed with by consent of parties.\r\n\r\n  The civil jury consists as in England of twelve jurors chosen by\r\n  ballot from the names on the list of those summoned. There is a right\r\n  of peremptory challenge limited to four, and also a right to challenge\r\n  for cause. Unanimity was at first but is not now required. The jury if\r\n  unanimous may return a verdict immediately on the close of the case.\r\n  If they are not unanimous they are enclosed and may at any time not\r\n  less than three hours after being enclosed return a verdict by a bare\r\n  majority. If after six hours they do not agree by the requisite\r\n  majority, i.e. are equally divided, they must be discharged. It was\r\n  stated by Commissioner Adam, under whom the Scots civil jury was\r\n  originated, that in twenty years he knew of only one case in which the\r\n  jury disagreed. Jury trial in civil cases in Scotland has not\r\n  flourished or given general satisfaction, and is resorted to only in a\r\n  small proportion of cases. This is partly due to its being\r\n  transplanted from England.\r\n\r\n  _Ireland._--The jury laws of Ireland do not differ in substance from\r\n  those of England. The qualifications of jurors are regulated by\r\n  O'Hagan's Acts 1871 and 1872, and the Juries Acts 1878 and 1894. In\r\n  criminal cases much freer use is made than in England of the rights of\r\n  the accused to challenge, and of the Crown to order jurors to stand\r\n  by, and what is called \"jury-packing\" seems to be the object of both\r\n  sides when some political or agrarian issue is involved in the trial.\r\n  Until the passing of the Irish Local Government Act 1898, the grand\r\n  jury, besides its functions as a jury of accusation, had large duties\r\n  with respect to local government which are now transferred to the\r\n  county councils and other elective bodies.\r\n\r\n  _British Empire._--In most parts of the British Empire the jury system\r\n  is in force as part of the original law of the colonists or under the\r\n  colonial charters of justice or by local legislation. The grand jury\r\n  is not in use in India; was introduced but later abolished in the Cape\r\n  Colony; and in Australia has been for most purposes superseded by the\r\n  public prosecutor. The ordinary trial jury for criminal cases is\r\n  twelve, but in India may be nine, seven, five or three, according to\r\n  certain provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code 1898. In countries\r\n  where the British Crown has foreign jurisdiction the jury for criminal\r\n  trials has in some cases been fixed at a less number than twelve and\r\n  the right of the Crown to fix the number is established; see _ex p.\r\n  Carew_, 1897, A.C. 719. In civil cases the number of the jury is\r\n  reduced in some colonies, e.g. to seven in Tasmania and Trinidad.\r\n\r\n  _European Countries._--In France there is no civil jury. In criminal\r\n  cases the place of the grand jury is taken by the _chambre des mises\r\n  en accusation_, and the more serious crimes are tried before a jury of\r\n  twelve which finds its verdict by a majority, the exact number of\r\n  which may not be disclosed. In Belgium, Spain, Italy and Germany,\r\n  certain classes of crime are tried with the aid of a jury.\r\n\r\n  _United States._--The English jury system was part of the law of the\r\n  American colonies before the declaration of independence; and grand\r\n  jury, coroner's jury and petty jury continue in full use in the United\r\n  States. Under the Federal Constitution (Article iii.) there is a right\r\n  to trial by jury in all criminal cases (except on impeachment) and in\r\n  all civil actions at common law in which the subject matter exceeds\r\n  $20 in value (amendments vi. and vii.). The trial jury must be of\r\n  twelve and its verdict must be unanimous; see Cooley, _Constitutional\r\n  Limitations_ (6th ed.), 389. The respective provinces of judge and\r\n  jury have been much discussed and there has been a disposition to\r\n  declare the jury supreme as to law as well as fact. The whole subject\r\n  is fully treated by reference to English and American authorities, and\r\n  the conflicting views are stated in _Sparf_ v. _United States_, 1895,\r\n  156 U.S. 61. The view of the majority of the court in that case was\r\n  that it is the duty of the jury in a criminal case to receive the law\r\n  from the court and to apply it as laid down by the court, subject to\r\n  the condition that in giving a general verdict the jury may\r\n  incidentally determine both law and fact as compounded in the issues\r\n  submitted to them in the particular case. The power to give a general\r\n  verdict renders the duty one of imperfect obligation and enables the\r\n  jury to take its own view of the terms and merits of the law involved.\r\n\r\n  The extent to which the jury system is in force in the states of the\r\n  union depends on the constitution and legislation of each state. In\r\n  some the use of juries in civil and even in criminal cases is reduced\r\n  or made subject to the election of the accused. In others unanimous\r\n  verdicts are not required, while the constitutions of others require\r\n  the unanimous verdict of the common law dozen.     (W. F.

The number of the jury (twelve) is responsible for\r\n    some unfounded theories of the origin of the system. This use of\r\n    twelve is not confined to England, nor in England or elsewhere to\r\n    judicial institutions. \"Its general prevalence,\" says Hallam (_Middle\r\n    Ages_, ch. viii.), \"shows that in searching for the origin of trial\r\n    by jury we cannot rely for a moment upon any analogy which the mere\r\n    number affords.\" In a _Guide to English Juries_ (1682), by a person\r\n    of quality (attributed to Lord Somers), the following passage occurs:\r\n    \"In analogy of late the jury is reduced to the number of twelve, like\r\n    as the prophets were twelve to foretell the truth; the apostles\r\n    twelve to preach the truth; the discoverers twelve, sent into Canaan\r\n    to seek and report the truth; and the stones twelve that the heavenly\r\n    Hierusalem is built on.\" Lord Coke indulged in similar speculations.\r\n\r\n  [7] See _R._ v. _Dean of St. Asaph_ (1789), 3 T.R. 418.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUS PRIMAE NOCTIS, or DROIT DU SEIGNEUR, a custom alleged to have\r\nexisted in medieval Europe, giving the overlord a right to the virginity\r\nof his vassals' daughters on their wedding night. For the existence of\r\nthe custom in a legalized form there is no trustworthy evidence. That\r\nsome such abuse of power may have been occasionally exercised by brutal\r\nnobles in the lawless days of the early middle ages is only too likely,\r\nbut the _jus_, it seems, is a myth, invented no earlier than the 16th or\r\n17th century. There appears to have been an entirely religious custom\r\nestablished by the council of Carthage in 398, whereby the Church\r\nrequired from the faithful continence on the wedding-night, and this may\r\nhave been, and there is evidence that it was, known as _Droit du\r\nSeigneur_, or \"God's right.\" Later the clerical admonition was extended\r\nto the first three days of marriage. This religious abstention, added to\r\nthe undoubted fact that the feudal lord extorted fines on the marriages\r\nof his vassals and their children, doubtless gave rise to the belief\r\nthat the _jus_ was once an established custom.\r\n\r\n  The whole subject has been exhaustively treated by Louis Veuillot in\r\n  _Le Droit du seigneur au moyen âge_ (1854).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUS RELICTAE, in Scots law, the widow's right in the movable property of\r\nher deceased husband. The deceased must have been domiciled in Scotland,\r\nbut the right accrues from movable property, wherever situated. The\r\nwidow's provision amounts to one-third where there are children\r\nsurviving, and to one-half where there are no surviving children. The\r\nwidow's right vests by survivance, and is independent of the husband's\r\ntestamentary provisions; it may however be renounced by contract, or be\r\ndischarged by satisfaction. It is subject to alienation of the husband's\r\nmovable estate during his lifetime or by its conversion into heritage.\r\nSee also WILL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSSERAND, JEAN ADRIEN ANTOINE JULES (1855-   ), French author and\r\ndiplomatist, was born at Lyons on the 18th of February 1855. Entering\r\nthe diplomatic service in 1876, he became in 1878 consul in London.\r\nAfter an interval spent in Tunis he returned to London in 1887 as a\r\nmember of the French Embassy. In 1890 he became French minister at\r\nCopenhagen, and in 1902 was transferred to Washington. A close student\r\nof English literature, he produced some very lucid and vivacious\r\nmonographs on comparatively little-known subjects: _Le Théâtre en\r\nAngleterre depuis la conquête jusqu' aux prédécesseurs immédiats de\r\nShakespeare_ (1878); _Le Roman au temps de Shakespeare_ (1887; Eng.\r\ntrans. by Miss E. Lee, 1890); _Les Anglais au moyen âge: la vie nomade\r\net les routes d'Angleterre au XIV^e siècle_ (1884; Eng. trans., _English\r\nWayfaring Life in the Middle Ages_, by L. T. Smith, 1889); and _L'Épopée\r\nde Langland_ (1893; Eng. trans., _Piers Plowman_, by M. C. R., 1894).\r\nHis _Histoire littéraire du peuple anglais_, the first volume of which\r\nwas published in 1895, was completed in three volumes in 1909. In\r\nEnglish he wrote _A French Ambassador at the Court of Charles II._\r\n(1892), from the unpublished papers of the count de Cominges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSSIEU, DE, the name of a French family which came into prominent\r\nnotice towards the close of the 16th century, and for a century and a\r\nhalf was distinguished for the botanists it produced. The following are\r\nits more eminent members:--\r\n\r\n1. ANTOINE DE JUSSIEU (1686-1758), born at Lyons on the 6th of July\r\n1686, was the son of Christophe de Jussieu (or Dejussieu), an apothecary\r\nof some repute, who published a _Nouveau traité de la thériaque_ (1708).\r\nAntoine studied at the university of Montpellier, and travelled with his\r\nbrother Bernard through Spain, Portugal and southern France. He went to\r\nParis in 1708, J. P. de Tournefort, whom he succeeded at the Jardin des\r\nPlantes, dying in that year. His own original publications are not of\r\nmarked importance, but he edited an edition of Tournefort's\r\n_Institutiones rei herbariae_ (3 vols., 1719), and also a posthumous\r\nwork of Jacques Barrelier, _Plantae per Galliam, Hispaniam, et Italiam\r\nobservatae_, &c. (1714). He practised medicine, chiefly devoting himself\r\nto the very poor. He died at Paris on the 22nd of April 1758.\r\n\r\n2. BERNARD DE JUSSIEU (1699-1777), a younger brother of the above, was\r\nborn at Lyons on the 17th of August 1699. He took a medical degree at\r\nMontpellier and began practice in 1720, but finding the work uncongenial\r\nhe gladly accepted his brother's invitation to Paris in 1722, when he\r\nsucceeded Sébastien Vaillant as sub-demonstrator of plants in the Jardin\r\ndu Roi. In 1725 he brought out a new edition of Tournefort's _Histoire\r\ndes plantes qui naissent aux environs de Paris_, 2 vols., which was\r\nafterwards translated into English by John Martyn, the original work\r\nbeing incomplete. In the same year he was admitted into the académie des\r\nsciences, and communicated several papers to that body. Long before\r\nAbraham Trembley (1700-1784) published his _Histoire des polypes d'eau\r\ndouce_, Jussieu maintained the doctrine that these organisms were\r\nanimals, and not the flowers of marine plants, then the current notion;\r\nand to confirm his views he made three journeys to the coast of\r\nNormandy. Singularly modest and retiring, he published very little, but\r\nin 1759 he arranged the plants in the royal garden of the Trianon at\r\nVersailles, according to his own scheme of classification. This\r\narrangement is printed in his nephew's _Genera_, pp. lxiii.-lxx., and\r\nformed the basis of that work. He cared little for the credit of\r\nenunciating new discoveries, so long as the facts were made public. On\r\nthe death of his brother Antoine, he could not be induced to succeed him\r\nin his office, but prevailed upon L. G. Lemonnier to assume the higher\r\nposition. He died at Paris on the 6th of November 1777.\r\n\r\n3. JOSEPH DE JUSSIEU (1704-1779), brother of Antoine and Bernard, was\r\nborn at Lyons on the 3rd of September 1704. Educated like the rest of\r\nthe family for the medical profession, he accompanied C. M. de la\r\nCondamine to Peru, in the expedition for measuring an arc of meridian,\r\nand remained in South America for thirty-six years, returning to France\r\nin 1771. Amongst the seeds he sent to his brother Bernard were those of\r\n_Heliotropium peruvianum_, Linn., then first introduced into Europe. He\r\ndied at Paris on the 11th of April 1779.\r\n\r\n4. ANTOINE LAURENT DE JUSSIEU (1748-1836), nephew of the three\r\npreceding, was born at Lyons on the 12th of April 1748. Called to Paris\r\nby his uncle Bernard, and carefully trained by him for the pursuits of\r\nmedicine and botany, he largely profited by the opportunities afforded\r\nhim. Gifted with a tenacious memory, and the power of quickly grasping\r\nthe salient points of subjects under observation, he steadily worked at\r\nthe improvement of that system of plant arrangement which had been\r\nsketched out by his uncle. In 1789 was issued his _Genera plantarum\r\nsecundum ordines naturales disposita, juxta methodum in horto regio\r\nParisiensi exaratam, anno_ MDCCLXXIV. This volume formed the basis of\r\nmodern classification; more than this, it is certain that Cuvier derived\r\nmuch help in his zoological classification from its perusal. Hardly had\r\nthe last sheet passed through the press, when the French Revolution\r\nbroke out, and the author was installed in charge of the hospitals of\r\nParis. The muséum d'histoire naturelle was organized on its present\r\nfooting mainly by him in 1793, and he selected for its library\r\neverything relating to natural history from the vast materials obtained\r\nfrom the convents then broken up. He continued as professor of botany\r\nthere from 1770 to 1826, when his son Adrien succeeded him. Besides the\r\n_Genera_, he produced nearly sixty memoirs on botanical topics. He died\r\nat Paris on the 17th of September 1836.\r\n\r\n5. ADRIEN LAURENT HENRI DE JUSSIEU (1797-1853), son of Antoine Laurent,\r\nwas born at Paris on the 23rd of December 1797. He displayed the\r\nqualities of his family in his thesis for the degree of M.D., _De\r\nEuphorbiacearum generibus medicisque earundem viribus tentamen_, Paris,\r\n1824. He was also the author of valuable contributions to botanical\r\nliterature on the _Rutaceae_, _Meliaceae_ and _Malpighiaceae_\r\nrespectively, of \"Taxonomie\" in the _Dictionnaire universelle d'histoire\r\nnaturelle_, and of an introductory work styled simply _Botanique_, which\r\nreached nine editions, and was translated into the principal languages\r\nof Europe. He also edited his father's _Introductio in historiam\r\nplantarum_, issued at Paris, without imprint or date, it being a\r\nfragment of the intended second edition of the _Genera_, which Antoine\r\nLaurent did not live to complete. He died at Paris on the 29th of June\r\n1853, leaving two daughters, but no son, so that with him closed the\r\nbrilliant botanical dynasty.\r\n\r\n6. LAURENT PIERRE DE JUSSIEU (1792-1866), miscellaneous writer, nephew\r\nof Antoine Laurent, was born at Villeurbanne on the 7th of February\r\n1792. His _Simon de Nantua, ou le marchand forain_ (1818), reached\r\nfifteen editions, and was translated into seven languages. He also wrote\r\n_Simples notions de physique et d'histoire naturelle_ (1857), and a few\r\ngeological papers. He died at Passy on the 23rd of February 1866.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE (Lat. _justitia_), a term used both in the abstract, for the\r\nquality of being or doing what is just, i.e. right in law and equity,\r\nand in the concrete for an officer deputed by the sovereign to\r\nadminister justice, and do right by way of judgment. It has long been\r\nthe official title of the judges of two of the English superior courts\r\nof common law, and it is now extended to all the judges in the supreme\r\ncourt of judicature--a judge in the High Court of Justice being styled\r\nMr Justice, and in the court of appeal Lord Justice. The president of\r\nthe king's bench division of the High Court is styled Lord Chief Justice\r\n(q.v.). The word is also applied, and perhaps more usually, to certain\r\nsubordinate magistrates who administer justice in minor matters, and who\r\nare usually called _justices of the peace_ (q.v.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE OF THE PEACE, an inferior magistrate appointed in England by\r\nspecial commission under the great seal to keep the peace within the\r\njurisdiction for which he is appointed. The title is commonly\r\nabbreviated to J.P. and is used after the name. \"The whole Christian\r\nworld,\" said Coke, \"hath not the like office as justice of the peace if\r\nduly executed.\" Lord Cowper, on the other hand, described them as \"men\r\nsometimes illiterate and frequently bigoted and prejudiced.\" The truth\r\nis that the justices of the peace perform without any other reward than\r\nthe consequence they acquire from their office a large amount of work\r\nindispensable to the administration of the law, and (though usually not\r\nprofessional lawyers, and therefore apt to be ill-informed in some of\r\ntheir decisions) for the most part they discharge their duties with\r\nbecoming good sense and impartiality. For centuries they have\r\nnecessarily been chosen mainly from the landed class of country\r\ngentlemen, usually Conservative in politics; and in recent years the\r\nattempt has been made by the Liberal party to reduce the balance by\r\nappointing others than those belonging to the landed gentry, such as\r\ntradesmen, Nonconformist ministers, and working-men. But it has been\r\nrecognized that the appointment of justices according to their political\r\nviews is undesirable, and in 1909 a royal commission was appointed to\r\nconsider and report whether any and what steps should be taken to\r\nfacilitate the selection of the most suitable persons to be justices of\r\nthe peace irrespective of creed and political opinion. In great centres\r\nof population, when the judicial business of justices is heavy, it has\r\nbeen found necessary to appoint paid justices or stipendiary\r\nmagistrates[1] to do the work, and an extension of the system to the\r\ncountry districts has been often advocated.\r\n\r\nThe commission of the peace assigns to justices the duty of keeping and\r\ncausing to be kept all ordinances and statutes for the good of the peace\r\nand for preservation of the same, and for the quiet rule and government\r\nof the people, and further assigns \"to you and every two or more of you\r\n(of whom any one of the aforesaid A, B, C, D, &c., we will, shall be\r\none) to inquire the truth more fully by the oath of good and lawful men\r\nof the county of all and all manner of felonies, poisonings,\r\nenchantments, sorceries, arts, magic, trespasses, forestallings,\r\nregratings, engrossings, and extortions whatever.\" This part of the\r\ncommission is the authority for the jurisdiction of the justices in\r\n_sessions_. Justices named specially in the parenthetical clause are\r\nsaid to be on the quorum. Justices for counties are appointed by the\r\nCrown on the advice of the lord chancellor, and usually with the\r\nrecommendation of the lord lieutenant of the county. Justices for\r\nboroughs having municipal corporations and separate commissions of the\r\npeace are appointed by the crown, the lord chancellor either adopting\r\nthe recommendation of the town council or acting independently. Justices\r\ncannot act as such until they have taken the oath of allegiance and the\r\njudicial oath. A justice for a borough while acting as such must reside\r\nin or within seven miles of the borough or occupy a house, warehouse or\r\nother property in the borough, but he need not be a burgess. The mayor\r\nof a borough is _ex officio_ a justice during his year of office and the\r\nsucceeding year. He takes precedence over all borough justices, but not\r\nover justices acting in and for the county in which the borough or any\r\npart thereof is situated, unless when acting in relation to the business\r\nof the borough. The chairman of a county council is _ex officio_ a\r\njustice of the peace for the county, and the chairman of an urban or\r\nrural district council for the county in which the district is situated.\r\nJustices cannot act beyond the limits of the jurisdiction for which they\r\nare appointed, and the warrant of a justice cannot be executed out of\r\nhis jurisdiction unless it be backed, that is, endorsed by a justice of\r\nthe jurisdiction in which it is to be carried into execution. A justice\r\nimproperly refusing to act on his office, or acting partially and\r\ncorruptly, may be proceeded against by a criminal information, and a\r\njustice refusing to act may be compelled to do so by the High Court of\r\nJustice. An action will lie against a justice for any act done by him in\r\nexcess of his jurisdiction, and for any act within his jurisdiction\r\nwhich has been done wrongfully and with malice, and without reasonable\r\nor probable cause. But no action can be brought against a justice for a\r\nwrongful conviction until it has been quashed. By the Justices'\r\nQualification Act 1744, every justice for a county was required to have\r\nan estate of freehold, copyhold, or customary tenure in fee, for life or\r\na given term, of the yearly value of £100. By an act of 1875 the\r\noccupation of a house rated at £100 was made a qualification. No such\r\nqualifications were ever required for a borough justice, and it was not\r\nuntil 1906 that county justices were put on the same footing in this\r\nrespect. The Justices of the Peace Act 1906 did away with all\r\nqualification by estate. It also removed the necessity for residence\r\nwithin the county, permitting the same residential qualification as for\r\nborough justices, \"within seven miles thereof.\" The same act removed the\r\ndisqualification of solicitors to be county justices and assimilated to\r\nthe existing power to remove other justices from the commission of the\r\npeace the power to exclude _ex officio_ justices.\r\n\r\nThe justices for every petty sessional division of a county or for a\r\nborough having a separate commission of the peace must appoint a fit\r\nperson to be their salaried clerk. He must be either a barrister of not\r\nless than fourteen years' standing, or a solicitor of the supreme court,\r\nor have served for not less than seven years as a clerk to a police or\r\nstipendiary magistrate or to a metropolitan police court. An alderman or\r\ncouncillor of a borough must not be appointed as clerk, nor can a clerk\r\nof the peace for the borough or for the county in which the borough is\r\nsituated be appointed. A borough clerk is not allowed to prosecute. The\r\nsalary of a justice's clerk comes, in London, out of the police fund; in\r\ncounties out of the county fund; in county boroughs out of the borough\r\nfund, and in other boroughs out of the county fund.\r\n\r\nThe vast and multifarious duties of the justices cover some portion of\r\nevery important head of the criminal law, and extend to a considerable\r\nnumber of matters relating to the civil law.\r\n\r\nIn the United States these officers are sometimes appointed by the\r\nexecutive, sometimes elected. In some states, justices of the peace have\r\njurisdiction in civil cases given to them by local regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] Where a borough council desire the appointment of a stipendiary\r\n    magistrate they may present a petition for the same to the secretary\r\n    of state and it is thereupon lawful for the king to appoint to that\r\n    office a barrister of seven years' standing. He is by virtue of his\r\n    office a justice for the borough, and receives a yearly salary,\r\n    payable in four equal quarterly instalments. On a vacancy,\r\n    application must again be made as for a first appointment. There may\r\n    be more than one stipendiary magistrate for a borough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICIAR (med. Lat. _justiciarius_ or _justitiarius_, a judge), in\r\nEnglish history, the title of the chief minister of the Norman and\r\nearlier Angevin kings. The history of the title in this connotation is\r\nsomewhat obscure. _Justiciarius_ meant simply \"judge,\" and was\r\noriginally applied, as Stubbs points out (_Const. Hist._ i. 389, note),\r\nto any officer of the king's court, to the chief justice, or in a very\r\ngeneral way to all and sundry who possessed courts of their own or were\r\nqualified to act as _judices_ in the shire-courts, even the style\r\n_capitalis justiciarius_ being used of judges of the royal court other\r\nthan the chief. It was not till the reign of Henry II. that the title\r\n_summus_ or _capitalis justiciarius_, or _justiciarius totius Angliae_\r\nwas exclusively applied to the king's chief minister. The office,\r\nhowever, existed before the style of its holder was fixed; and, whatever\r\ntheir contemporary title (e.g. _Custos Angliae_), later writers refer to\r\nthem as _justiciarii_, with or without the prefix _summus_ or\r\n_capitalis_ (ibid. p. 346). Thus Ranulf Flambard, the minister of\r\nWilliam II., who was probably the first to exercise the powers of a\r\njusticiar, is called _justiciarius_ by Ordericus Vitalis.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the justiciarship is thus given by Stubbs (ibid. p. 276).\r\nThe sheriff \"was the king's representative in all matters judicial,\r\nmilitary and financial in the shire. From him, or from the courts of\r\nwhich he was the presiding officer, appeal lay to the king alone; but\r\nthe king was often absent from England and did not understand the\r\nlanguage of his subjects. In his absence the administration was\r\nentrusted to a justiciar, a regent or lieutenant of the kingdom; and the\r\nconvenience being once ascertained of having a minister who could in the\r\nwhole kingdom represent the king, as the sheriff did in the shire, the\r\njusticiar became a permanent functionary.\"\r\n\r\nThe fact that the kings were often absent from England, and that the\r\njusticiarship was held by great nobles or churchmen, made this office of\r\nan importance which at times threatened to overshadow that of the Crown.\r\nIt was this latter circumstance which ultimately led to its abolition.\r\nHubert de Burgh (q.v.) was the last of the great justiciars; after his\r\nfall (1231) the justiciarship was not again committed to a great baron,\r\nand the chancellor soon took the position formerly occupied by the\r\njusticiar as second to the king in dignity, as well as in power and\r\ninfluence. Finally, under Edward I. and his successor, in place of the\r\njusticiar--who had presided over all causes _vice regis_--separate heads\r\nwere established in the three branches into which the _curia regis_ as a\r\njudicial body had been divided: justices of common pleas, justices of\r\nthe king's bench and barons of the exchequer.\r\n\r\nOutside England the title justiciar was given under Henry II. to the\r\nseneschal of Normandy. In Scotland the title of justiciar was borne,\r\nunder the earlier kings, by two high officials, one having his\r\njurisdiction to the north, the other to the south of the Forth. They\r\nwere the king's lieutenants for judicial and administrative purposes and\r\nwere established in the 12th century, either by Alexander I. or by his\r\nsuccessor David I. In the 12th century a _magister justitiarius_ also\r\nappears in the Norman kingdom of Sicily, title and office being probably\r\nborrowed from England; he presided over the royal court (_Magna curia_)\r\nand was, with his assistants, empowered to decide, _inter alia_, all\r\ncases reserved to the Crown (see Du Cange, _s.v. Magister\r\nJustitiarius_).\r\n\r\n  See W. Stubbs, _Const. Hist. of England_; Du Cange, _Glossarium_\r\n  (Niort, 1885) s.v. \"Justitiarius.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICIARY, HIGH COURT OF, in Scotland, the supreme criminal court,\r\nconsisting of five of the lords of session together with the lord\r\njustice-general and the lord justice-clerk as president and\r\nvice-president respectively. The constitution of the court is settled by\r\nthe Act 1672 c. 16. The lords of justiciary hold circuits regularly\r\ntwice a year according to the ancient practice, which, however, had been\r\nallowed to fall into disuse until revived in 1748. For circuit purposes\r\nScotland is divided into northern, southern and western districts (see\r\nCIRCUIT). Two judges generally go on a circuit, and in Glasgow they are\r\nby special statute authorized to sit in separate courts. By the Criminal\r\nProcedure (Scotland) Act 1887 all the senators of the college of justice\r\nare lords commissioners of justiciary. The high court, sitting in\r\nEdinburgh, has, in addition to its general jurisdiction, an exclusive\r\njurisdiction for districts not within the jurisdiction of the\r\ncircuits--the three Lothians, and Orkney and Shetland. The high court\r\nalso takes up points of difficulty arising before the special courts,\r\nlike the court for crown cases reserved in England. The court of\r\njusticiary has authority to try all crimes, unless when its jurisdiction\r\nhas been excluded by special enactment of the legislature. It is also\r\nstated to have an inherent jurisdiction to punish all criminal acts,\r\neven if they have never before been treated as crimes. Its judgments are\r\nbelieved to be not subject to any appeal or review, but it may be\r\ndoubted whether an appeal on a point of law would not lie to the house\r\nof lords. The following crimes must be prosecuted in the court of\r\njusticiary: treason, murder, robbery, rape, fire-raising, deforcement of\r\nmessengers, breach of duty by magistrates, and all offences for which a\r\nstatutory punishment higher than imprisonment is imposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTIFICATION, in law, the showing by a defendant in a suit of\r\nsufficient reason why he did what he was called upon to answer, For\r\nexample, in an action for assault and battery, the defendant may prove\r\nin justification that the prosecutor assaulted or beat him first, and\r\nthat he acted merely in self-defence. The word is employed particularly\r\nin actions for defamation, and has in this connexion a somewhat special\r\nmeaning. When a libel consists of a specific charge a plea of\r\njustification is a plea that the words are true in substance and in fact\r\n(see LIBEL AND SLANDER).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTIN I. (450-527), East Roman emperor (518-527), was born in 450 as a\r\npeasant in Asia, but enlisting under Leo I. he rose to be commander of\r\nthe imperial guards of Anastasius. On the latter's death in 518 Justin\r\nused for his own election to the throne money that he had received for\r\nthe support of another candidate. Being ignorant even of the rudiments\r\nof letters, Justin entrusted the administration of state to his wise and\r\nfaithful quaestor Proclus and to his nephew Justinian, though his own\r\nexperience dictated several improvements in military affairs. An\r\northodox churchman himself, he effected in 519 a reconciliation of the\r\nEastern and Western Churches, after a schism of thirty-five years (see\r\nHORMISDAS). In 522 he entered upon a desultory war with Persia, in which\r\nhe co-operated with the Arabs. In 522 also Justin ceded to Theodoric,\r\nthe Gothic king of Italy, the right of naming the consuls. On the 1st of\r\nApril 527 Justin, enfeebled by an incurable wound, yielded to the\r\nrequest of the senate and assumed Justinian at his colleague; on the 1st\r\nof August he died. Justin bestowed much care on the repairing of public\r\nbuildings throughout his empire, and contributed large sums to repair\r\nthe damage caused by a destructive earthquake at Antioch.\r\n\r\n  See E. Gibbon, _Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire_ (ed. Bury,\r\n  1896), iv. 206-209.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTIN II. (d. 578), East Roman emperor (565-578), was the nephew and\r\nsuccessor of Justinian I. He availed himself of his influence as master\r\nof the palace, and as husband of Sophia, the niece of the late empress\r\nTheodora, to secure a peaceful election. The first few days of his\r\nreign--when he paid his uncle's debts, administered justice in person,\r\nand proclaimed universal religious toleration--gave bright promise, but\r\nin the face of the lawless aristocracy and defiant governors of\r\nprovinces he effected few subsequent reforms. The most important event\r\nof his reign was the invasion of Italy by the Lombards (q.v.), who,\r\nentering in 568, under Alboin, in a few years made themselves masters of\r\nnearly the entire country. Justin's attention was distracted from Italy\r\ntowards the N. and E. frontiers. After refusing to pay the Avars\r\ntribute, he fought several unsuccessful campaigns against them. In 572\r\nhis overtures to the Turks led to a war with Persia. After two\r\ndisastrous campaigns, in which his enemies overran Syria, Justin bought\r\na precarious peace by payment of a yearly tribute. The temporary fits of\r\ninsanity into which he fell warned him to name a colleague. Passing over\r\nhis own relatives, he raised, on the advice of Sophia, the general\r\nTiberius (q.v.) to be Caesar in December 574 and withdrew for his\r\nremaining years into retirement.\r\n\r\n  See E. Gibbon, _Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire_ (ed. Bury,\r\n  1896), v. 2-17; G. Finlay, _History of Greece_ (ed. 1877), i. 291-297;\r\n  J. Bury, _The Later Roman Empire_ (1889), ii. 67-79.     (M. O. B. C.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTIN (JUNIANUS JUSTINUS), Roman historian, probably lived during the\r\nage of the Antonines. Of his personal history nothing is known. He is\r\nthe author of _Historiarum Philippicarum libri XLIV._, a work described\r\nby himself in his preface as a collection of the most important and\r\ninteresting passages from the voluminous _Historiae philippicae et\r\ntotius mundi origines et terrae situs_, written in the time of Augustus\r\nby Pompeius Trogus (q.v.). The work of Trogus is lost; but the _prologi_\r\nor arguments of the text are preserved by Pliny and other writers.\r\nAlthough the main theme of Trogus was the rise and history of the\r\nMacedonian monarchy, Justin yet permitted himself considerable freedom\r\nof digression, and thus produced a capricious anthology instead of a\r\nregular epitome of the work. As it stands, however, the history contains\r\nmuch valuable information. The style, though far from perfect, is clear\r\nand occasionally elegant. The book was much used in the middle ages,\r\nwhen the author was sometimes confounded with Justin Martyr.\r\n\r\n  Ed. princeps (1470); J. G. Graevius (1668); J. F. Gronovius (1719); C.\r\n  H.

Flavius Anicius Justinianus, surnamed the Great,\r\nthe most famous of all the emperors of the Eastern Roman Empire, was by\r\nbirth a barbarian, native of a place called Tauresium in the district of\r\nDardania, a region of Illyricum,[1] and was born, most probably, on the\r\n11th of May 483. His family has been variously conjectured, on the\r\nstrength of the proper names which its members are stated to have borne,\r\nto have been Teutonic or Slavonic. The latter seems the more probable\r\nview. His own name was originally Uprauda.[2] Justinianus was a Roman\r\nname which he took from his uncle Justin I., who adopted him, and to\r\nwhom his advancement in life was due. Of his early life we know nothing\r\nexcept that he went to Constantinople while still a young man, and\r\nreceived there an excellent education. Doubtless he knew Latin before\r\nGreek; it is alleged that he always spoke Greek with a barbarian accent.\r\nWhen Justin ascended the throne in 518, Justinian became at once a\r\nperson of the first consequence, guiding, especially in church matters,\r\nthe policy of his aged, childless and ignorant uncle, receiving high\r\nrank and office at his hands, and soon coming to be regarded as his\r\ndestined successor. On Justin's death in 527, having been a few months\r\nearlier associated with him as co-emperor, Justinian succeeded without\r\nopposition to the throne. About 523 he had married the famous Theodora\r\n(q.v.), who, as empress regnant, was closely associated in all his\r\nactions till her death in 547.\r\n\r\nJustinian's reign was filled with great events, both at home and abroad,\r\nboth in peace and in war. They may be classed under four heads: (1) his\r\nlegal reforms; (2) his administration of the empire; (3) his\r\necclesiastical policy; and (4) his wars and foreign policy generally.\r\n\r\n1. It is as a legislator and codifier of the law that Justinian's name\r\nis most familiar to the modern world; and it is therefore this\r\ndepartment of his action that requires to be most fully dealt with here.\r\nHe found the law of the Roman empire in a state of great confusion. It\r\nconsisted of two masses, which were usually distinguished as old law\r\n(_jus vetus_) and new law (_jus novum_). The first of these comprised:\r\n(i.) all such of the statutes (_leges_) passed under the republic and\r\nearly empire as had not become obsolete; (ii.) the decrees of the senate\r\n(_senatus consulta_) passed at the end of the republic and during the\r\nfirst two centuries of the empire; (iii.) the writings of the jurists of\r\nthe later republic and of the empire, and more particularly of those\r\njurists to whom the right of declaring the law with authority (_jus\r\nrespondendi_) had been committed by the emperors. As these jurists had\r\nin their commentaries upon the _leges_, _senatus consulta_ and edicts of\r\nthe magistrates practically incorporated all that was of importance in\r\nthose documents, the books of the jurists may substantially be taken as\r\nincluding (i.) and (ii.). These writings were of course very numerous,\r\nand formed a vast mass of literature. Many of them had become\r\nexceedingly scarce--many had been altogether lost. Some were of doubtful\r\nauthenticity. They were so costly that no person of moderate means could\r\nhope to possess any large number; even the public libraries had nothing\r\napproaching to a complete collection. Moreover, as they proceeded from a\r\nlarge number of independent authors, who wrote expressing their own\r\nopinions, they contained many discrepancies and contradictions, the\r\ndicta of one writer being controverted by another, while yet both\r\nwriters might enjoy the same formal authority. A remedy had been\r\nattempted to be applied to this evil by a law of the emperors\r\nTheodosius II. and Valentinian III., which gave special weight to the\r\nwritings of five eminent jurists (Papinian, Paulus, Ulpian, Modestinus,\r\nGaius); but it was very far from removing it. As regards the _jus\r\nvetus_, therefore, the judges and practitioners of Justinian's time had\r\ntwo terrible difficulties to contend with--first, the bulk of the law,\r\nwhich made it impossible for any one to be sure that he possessed\r\nanything like the whole of the authorities bearing on the point in\r\nquestion, so that he was always liable to find his opponent quoting\r\nagainst him some authority for which he could not be prepared; and,\r\nsecondly, the uncertainty of the law, there being a great many important\r\npoints on which differing opinions of equal legal validity might be\r\ncited, so that the practising counsel could not advise, nor the judge\r\ndecide, with any confidence that he was right, or that a superior court\r\nwould uphold his view.\r\n\r\nThe new law (_jus novum_), which consisted of the ordinances of the\r\nemperors promulgated during the middle and later empires (_edicta_,\r\n_rescripta_, _mandata_, _decreta_, usually called by the general name of\r\n_constitutiones_), was in a condition not much better. These ordinances\r\nor constitutions were extremely numerous. No complete collection of them\r\nexisted, for although two collections (_Codex gregorianus_ and _Codex\r\nhermogenianus_) had been made by two jurists in the 4th century, and a\r\nlarge supplementary collection published by the emperor Theodosius II.\r\nin 438 (_Codex theodosianus_), these collections did not include all the\r\nconstitutions; there were others which it was necessary to obtain\r\nseparately, but many whereof it must have been impossible for a private\r\nperson to procure. In this branch too of the law there existed some,\r\nthough a less formidable, uncertainty; for there were constitutions\r\nwhich practically, if not formally, repealed or superseded others\r\nwithout expressly mentioning them, so that a man who relied on one\r\nconstitution might find that it had been varied or abrogated by another\r\nhe had never heard of or on whose sense he had not put such a\r\nconstruction. It was therefore clearly necessary with regard to both the\r\nolder and the newer law to take some steps to collect into one or more\r\nbodies or masses so much of the law as was to be regarded as binding,\r\nreducing it within a reasonable compass, and purging away the\r\ncontradictions or inconsistencies which it contained. The evil had been\r\nlong felt, and reforms apparently often proposed, but nothing (except by\r\nthe compilation of the _Codex theodosianus_) had been done till\r\nJustinian's time. Immediately after his accession, in 528, he appointed\r\na commission to deal with the imperial constitutions (_jus novum_), this\r\nbeing the easier part of the problem. The commissioners, ten in number,\r\nwere directed to go through all the constitutions of which copies\r\nexisted, to select such as were of practical value, to cut these down by\r\nretrenching all unnecessary matter, and gather them, arranged in order\r\nof date, into one volume, getting rid of any contradictions by omitting\r\none or other of the conflicting passages.[3] These statute law\r\ncommissioners, as one may call them, set to work forthwith, and\r\ncompleted their task in fourteen months, distributing the constitutions\r\nwhich they placed in the new collection into ten books, in general\r\nconformity with the order of the Perpetual Edict as settled by Salvius\r\nJulianus and enacted by Hadrian. By this means the bulk of the statute\r\nlaw was immensely reduced, its obscurities and internal discrepancies in\r\ngreat measure removed, its provisions adapted, by the abrogation of what\r\nwas obsolete, to the circumstances of Justinian's own time. This _Codex\r\nconstitutionum_ was formally promulgated and enacted as one great\r\nconsolidating statute in 529, all imperial ordinances not included in it\r\nbeing repealed at one stroke.\r\n\r\nThe success of this first experiment encouraged the emperor to attempt\r\nthe more difficult enterprise of simplifying and digesting the older law\r\ncontained in the treatises of the jurists. Before entering on this,\r\nhowever, he wisely took the preliminary step of settling the more\r\nimportant of the legal questions as to which the older jurists had been\r\ndivided in opinion, and which had therefore remained sources of\r\ndifficulty, a difficulty aggravated by the general decline, during the\r\nlast two centuries, of the level of forensic and judicial learning. This\r\nwas accomplished by a series of constitutions known as the \"Fifty\r\nDecisions\" (_Quinquaginta decisiones_), along with which there were\r\npublished other ordinances amending the law in a variety of points, in\r\nwhich old and now inconvenient rules had been suffered to subsist. Then\r\nin December 530 a new commission was appointed, consisting of sixteen\r\neminent lawyers, of whom the president, the famous Tribonian (who had\r\nalready served on the previous commission), was an exalted official\r\n(_quaestor_), four were professors of law, and the remaining eleven\r\npractising advocates. The instructions given to them by the emperor were\r\nas follows:--they were to procure and peruse all the writings of all the\r\nauthorized jurists (those who had enjoyed the _jus respondendi_); were\r\nto extract from these writings whatever was of most permanent and\r\nsubstantial value, with power to change the expressions of the author\r\nwherever conciseness or clearness would be thereby promoted, or wherever\r\nsuch a change was needed in order to adapt his language to the condition\r\nof the law as it stood in Justinian's time; were to avoid repetitions\r\nand contradictions by giving only one statement of the law upon each\r\npoint; were to insert nothing at variance with any provision contained\r\nin the _Codex constitutionum_; and were to distribute the results of\r\ntheir labours into fifty books, subdividing each book into titles, and\r\nfollowing generally the order of the Perpetual Edict.[4]\r\n\r\nThese directions were carried out with a speed which is surprising when\r\nwe remember not only that the work was interrupted by the terrible\r\ninsurrection which broke out in Constantinople in January 532, and which\r\nled to the temporary retirement from office of Tribonian, but also that\r\nthe mass of literature which had to be read through consisted of no less\r\nthan two thousand treatises, comprising three millions of sentences. The\r\ncommissioners, who had for greater despatch divided themselves into\r\nseveral committees, presented their selection of extracts to the emperor\r\nin 533, and he published it as an imperial statute on December 16th of\r\nthat year, with two prefatory constitutions (those known as _Omnem\r\nreipublicae_ and _Dedit nobis_). It is the Latin volume which we now\r\ncall the _Digest_ (_Digesta_) or _Pandects_ ([Greek: Pandektai]) and\r\nwhich is by far the most precious monument of the legal genius of the\r\nRomans, and indeed, whether one regards the intrinsic merits of its\r\nsubstance or the prodigious influence it has exerted and still exerts,\r\nthe most remarkable law-book that the world has seen. The extracts\r\ncomprised in it are 9123 in number, taken from thirty-nine authors, and\r\nare of greatly varying length, mostly only a few lines long. About\r\none-third (in quantity) come from Ulpian, a very copious writer; Paulus\r\nstands next. To each extract there is prefixed the name of the author,\r\nand of the treatise whence it is taken.[5] The worst thing about the\r\n_Digest_ is its highly unscientific arrangement. The order of the\r\nPerpetual Edict, which appears to have been taken as a sort of model for\r\nthe general scheme of books and titles, was doubtless convenient to the\r\nRoman lawyers from their familiarity with it, but was in itself rather\r\naccidental and historical than logical. The disposition of the extracts\r\ninside each title was still less rational; it has been shown by a modern\r\njurist to have been the result of the way in which the committees of the\r\ncommissioners worked through the books they had to peruse.[6] In\r\nenacting the _Digest_ as a law book, Justinian repealed all the other\r\nlaw contained in the treatises of the jurists (that _jus vetus_ which\r\nhas been already mentioned), and directed that those treatises should\r\nnever be cited in future even by way of illustration; and he of course\r\nat the same time abrogated all the older statutes, from the Twelve\r\nTables downwards, which had formed a part of the _jus vetus_. This was a\r\nnecessary incident of his scheme of reform. But he went too far, and\r\nindeed attempted what was impossible, when he forbade all commentaries\r\nupon the _Digest_. He was obliged to allow a Greek translation to be\r\nmade of it, but directed this translation to be exactly literal.\r\n\r\nThese two great enterprises had substantially despatched Justinian's\r\nwork; however, he, or rather Tribonian, who seems to have acted both as\r\nhis adviser and as his chief executive officer in all legal affairs,\r\nconceived that a third book was needed, viz. an elementary manual for\r\nbeginners which should present an outline of the law in a clear and\r\nsimple form. The little work of Gaius, most of which we now possess\r\nunder the title of _Commentarii institutionum_, had served this purpose\r\nfor nearly four centuries; but much of it had, owing to changes in the\r\nlaw, become inapplicable, so that a new manual seemed to be required.\r\nJustinian accordingly directed Tribonian, with two coadjutors,\r\nTheophilus, professor of law in the university of Constantinople, and\r\nDorotheus, professor in the great law school at Beyrout, to prepare an\r\nelementary textbook on the lines of Gaius. This they did while the\r\n_Digest_ was in progress, and produced the useful little treatise which\r\nhas ever since been the book with which students commonly begin their\r\nstudies of Roman law, the _Institutes of Justinian_. It was published as\r\na statute with full legal validity shortly before the _Digest_. Such\r\nmerits as it possesses--simplicity of arrangement, clearness and\r\nconciseness of expression--belong less to Tribonian than to Gaius, who\r\nwas closely followed wherever the alterations in the law had not made\r\nhim obsolete. However, the spirit of that great legal classic seems to\r\nhave in a measure dwelt with and inspired the inferior men who were\r\nrecasting his work; the _Institutes_ is better both in Latinity and in\r\nsubstance than we should have expected from the condition of Latin\r\nletters at that epoch, better than the other laws which emanate from\r\nJustinian.\r\n\r\nIn the four years and a half which elapsed between the publication of\r\nthe _Codex_ and that of the _Digest_, many important changes had been\r\nmade in the law, notably by the publication of the \"Fifty Decisions,\"\r\nwhich settled many questions that had exercised the legal mind and given\r\noccasion to intricate statutory provisions. It was therefore natural\r\nthat the idea should present itself of revising the _Codex_, so as to\r\nintroduce these changes into it, for by so doing, not only would it be\r\nsimplified, but the one volume would again be made to contain the whole\r\nstatute law, whereas now it was necessary to read along with it the\r\nordinances issued since its publication. Accordingly another commission\r\nwas appointed, consisting of Tribonian with four other coadjutors, full\r\npower being given them not only to incorporate the new constitutions\r\nwith the _Codex_ and make in it the requisite changes, but also to\r\nrevise the _Codex_ generally, cutting down or filling in wherever they\r\nthought it necessary to do so. This work was completed in a few months;\r\nand in November 534 the revised _Codex_ (_Codex repetitae\r\npraelectionis_) was promulgated with the force of law, prefaced by a\r\nconstitution (_Cordi nobis_) which sets forth its history, and declares\r\nit to be alone authoritative, the former _Codex_ being abrogated. It is\r\nthis revised _Codex_ which has come down to the modern world, all copies\r\nof the earlier edition having disappeared.\r\n\r\n  The constitutions contained in it number 4652, the earliest dating\r\n  from Hadrian, the latest being of course Justinian's own. A few thus\r\n  belong to the period to which the greater part of the _Digest_\r\n  belongs, i.e. the so-called classical period of Roman law down to the\r\n  time of Alexander Severus (244); but the great majority are later, and\r\n  belong to one or other of the four great eras of imperial legislation,\r\n  the eras of Diocletian, of Constantine, of Theodosius II., and of\r\n  Justinian himself. Although this _Codex_ is said to have the same\r\n  general order as that of the _Digest_, viz. the order of the Perpetual\r\n  Edict, there are considerable differences of arrangement between the\r\n  two. It is divided into twelve books. Its contents, although of course\r\n  of the utmost practical importance to the lawyers of that time, and of\r\n  much value still, historical as well as legal, are far less\r\n  interesting and scientifically admirable than the extracts preserved\r\n  in the _Digest_. The difference is even greater than that between the\r\n  English reports of cases decided since the days of Lord Holt and the\r\n  English acts of parliament for the same two centuries.\r\n\r\n  The emperor's scheme was now complete. All the Roman law had been\r\n  gathered into two volumes of not excessive size, and a satisfactory\r\n  manual for beginners added. But Justinian and Tribonian had grown so\r\n  fond of legislating that they found it hard to leave off. Moreover,\r\n  the very simplifications that had been so far effected brought into\r\n  view with more clearness such anomalies or pieces of injustice as\r\n  still continued to deform the law. Thus no sooner had the work been\r\n  rounded off than fresh excrescences began to be created by the\r\n  publication of new laws. Between 534 and 565 Justinian issued a great\r\n  number of ordinances, dealing with all sorts of subjects and seriously\r\n  altering the law on many points--the majority appearing before the\r\n  death of Tribonian, which happened in 545. These ordinances are\r\n  called, by way of distinction, new constitutions, _Novellae\r\n  constitutiones post codicem_ ([Greek: nearai diataxeis]), _Novels_.\r\n  Although the emperor had stated in publishing the Codex that all\r\n  further statutes (if any) would be officially collected, this promise\r\n  does not seem to have been redeemed. The three collections of the\r\n  _Novels_ which we possess are apparently private collections, nor do\r\n  we even know how many such constitutions were promulgated. One of the\r\n  three contains 168 (together with 13 Edicts), but some of these are by\r\n  the emperors Justin II. and Tiberius II. Another, the so-called\r\n  _Epitome of Julian_, contains 125 Novels in Latin; and the third, the\r\n  _Liber authenticarum_ or _vulgata versio_, has 134, also in Latin.\r\n  This last was the collection first known and chiefly used in the West\r\n  during the middle ages; and of its 134 only 97 have been written on by\r\n  the _glossatores_ or medieval commentators; these therefore alone have\r\n  been received as binding in those countries which recognize and obey\r\n  the Roman law,--according to the maxim _Quicquid non agnoscit glossa,\r\n  nec agnoscit curia_. And, whereas Justinian's constitutions contained\r\n  in the _Codex_ were all issued in Latin, the rest of the book being in\r\n  that tongue, these _Novels_ were nearly all published in Greek, Latin\r\n  translations being of course made for the use of the western\r\n  provinces. They are very bulky, and with the exception of a few,\r\n  particularly the 116th and 118th, which introduce the most sweeping\r\n  and laudable reforms into the law of intestate succession, are much\r\n  more interesting, as supplying materials for the history of the time,\r\n  social, economical and ecclesiastical, than in respect of any purely\r\n  legal merits. They may be found printed in any edition of the _Corpus\r\n  juris civilis_.\r\n\r\n  This _Corpus juris_, which bears and immortalizes Justinian's name,\r\n  consists of the four books described above: (1) The authorized\r\n  collection of imperial ordinances (_Codex constitutionum_); (2) the\r\n  authorized collection of extracts from the great jurists (_Digesta_ or\r\n  _Pandectae_); (3) the elementary handbook (_Institutiones_); (4) the\r\n  unauthorized collection of constitutions subsequent to the _Codex_\r\n  (_Novellae_).\r\n\r\nFrom what has been already stated, the reader will perceive that\r\nJustinian did not, according to a strict use of terms, codify the Roman\r\nlaw. By a codification we understand the reduction of the whole\r\npre-existing body of law to a new form, the re-stating it in a series of\r\npropositions, scientifically ordered, which may or may not contain some\r\nnew substance, but are at any rate new in form. If he had, so to speak,\r\nthrown into one furnace all the law contained in the treatises of the\r\njurists and in the imperial ordinances, fused them down, the gold of the\r\none and the silver of the other, and run them out into new moulds, this\r\nwould have been codification. What he did do was something quite\r\ndifferent. It was not codification but consolidation, not remoulding but\r\nabridging. He made extracts from the existing law, preserving the old\r\nwords, and merely cutting out repetitions, removing contradictions,\r\nretrenching superfluities, so as immensely to reduce the bulk of the\r\nwhole. And he made not one set of such extracts but two, one for the\r\njurist law, the other for the statute law. He gave to posterity not one\r\ncode but two digests or collections of extracts, which are new only to\r\nthis extent that they are arranged in a new order, having been\r\npreviously altogether unconnected with one another, and that here and\r\nthere their words have been modified in order to bring one extract into\r\nharmony with some other. Except for this, the matter is old in\r\nexpression as well as in substance.\r\n\r\nThus regarded, even without remarking that the _Novels_, never having\r\nbeen officially collected, much less incorporated with the _Codex_, mar\r\nthe symmetry of the structure, Justinian's work may appear to entitle\r\nhim and Tribonian to much less credit than they have usually received\r\nfor it. But let it be observed, first, that to reduce the huge and\r\nconfused mass of pre-existing law into the compass of these two\r\ncollections was an immense practical benefit to the empire; secondly,\r\nthat, whereas the work which he undertook was accomplished in seven\r\nyears, the infinitely more difficult task of codification might probably\r\nhave been left unfinished at Tribonian's death, or even at Justinian's\r\nown, and been abandoned by his successor; thirdly, that in the extracts\r\npreserved in the _Digest_ we have the opinions of the greatest legal\r\nluminaries given in their own admirably lucid, philosophical and concise\r\nlanguage, while in the extracts of which the _Codex_ is composed we\r\nfind valuable historical evidence bearing on the administration and\r\nsocial condition of the later Pagan and earlier Christian empire;\r\nfourthly, that Justinian's age, that is to say, the intellect of the men\r\nwhose services he commanded, was quite unequal to so vast an undertaking\r\nas the fusing upon scientific principles into one new organic whole of\r\nthe entire law of the empire. With sufficient time and labour the work\r\nmight no doubt have been done; but what we possess of Justinian's own\r\nlegislation, and still more what we know of the general condition of\r\nliterary and legal capacity in his time, makes it certain that it would\r\nnot have been well done, and that the result would have been not more\r\nvaluable to the Romans of that age, and much less valuable to the modern\r\nworld, than are the results, preserved in the _Digest_ and the _Codex_,\r\nof what he and Tribonian actually did.\r\n\r\nTo the merits of the work as actually performed some reference has\r\nalready been made. The chief defect of the _Digest_ is in point of\r\nscientific arrangement, a matter about which the Roman lawyers, perhaps\r\none may say the ancients generally, cared very little. There are some\r\nrepetitions and some inconsistencies, but not more than may fairly be\r\nallowed for in a compilation of such magnitude executed so rapidly.\r\nTribonian has been blamed for the insertions the compilers made in the\r\nsentences of the old jurists (the so-called _Emblemata Triboniani_); but\r\nit was a part of Justinian's plan that such insertions should be made,\r\nso as to adapt those sentences to the law as settled in the emperor's\r\ntime. On Justinian's own laws, contained in the _Codex_ and in his\r\n_Novels_, a somewhat less favourable judgment must be pronounced. They,\r\nand especially the latter, are diffuse and often lax in expression,\r\nneedlessly prolix, and pompously rhetorical. The policy of many,\r\nparticularly of those which deal with ecclesiastical matters, may also\r\nbe condemned; yet some gratitude is due to the legislator who put the\r\nlaw of intestate succession on that plain and rational footing whereon\r\nit has ever since continued to stand. It is somewhat remarkable that,\r\nalthough Justinian is so much more familiar to us by his legislation\r\nthan by anything else, this sphere of his imperial labour is hardly\r\nreferred to by any of the contemporary historians, and then only with\r\ncensure. Procopius complains that he and Tribonian were always repealing\r\nold laws and enacting new ones, and accuses them of venal motives for\r\ndoing so.\r\n\r\n  The _Corpus Juris_ of Justinian continued to be, with naturally a few\r\n  additions in the ordinances of succeeding emperors, the chief law-book\r\n  of the Roman world till the time of the Macedonian dynasty when,\r\n  towards the end of the 9th century, a new system was prepared and\r\n  issued by those sovereigns, which we know as the _Basilica_. It is of\r\n  course written in Greek, and consists of parts of the substance of the\r\n  _Codex_ and the _Digest_, thrown together and often altered in\r\n  expression, together with some matter from the _Novels_ and imperial\r\n  ordinances posterior to Justinian. In the western provinces, which had\r\n  been wholly severed from the empire before the publication of the\r\n  _Basilica_, the law as settled by Justinian held its ground; but\r\n  copies of the _Corpus Juris_ were extremely rare, nor did the study of\r\n  it revive until the end of the 11th century.\r\n\r\n  The best edition of the _Digest_ is that of Mommsen (Berlin\r\n  1868-1870), and of the _Codex_ that of Krüger (Berlin 1875-1877).\r\n\r\n2. In his financial administration of the empire, Justinian is\r\nrepresented to us as being at once rapacious and extravagant. His\r\nunwearied activity and inordinate vanity led him to undertake a great\r\nmany costly public works, many of them, such as the erection of palaces\r\nand churches, unremunerative. The money needed for these, for his wars,\r\nand for buying off the barbarians who threatened the frontiers, had to\r\nbe obtained by increasing the burdens of the people. They suffered, not\r\nonly from the regular taxes, which were seldom remitted even after bad\r\nseasons, but also from monopolies; and Procopius goes so far as to\r\nallege that the emperor made a practice of further recruiting his\r\ntreasury by confiscating on slight or fictitious pretexts the property\r\nof persons who had displeased Theodora or himself. Fiscal severities\r\nwere no doubt one cause of the insurrections which now and then broke\r\nout, and in the gravest of which, (532) thirty thousand persons are said\r\nto have perished in the capital. It is not always easy to discover,\r\nputting together the trustworthy evidence of Justinian's own laws and\r\nthe angry complaints of Procopius, what was the nature and\r\njustification of the changes made in the civil administration. But the\r\ngeneral conclusion seems to be that these changes were always in the\r\ndirection of further centralization, increasing the power of the chief\r\nministers and their offices, bringing all more directly under the\r\ncontrol of the Crown, and in some cases limiting the powers and\r\nappropriating the funds of local municipalities. Financial necessities\r\ncompelled retrenchment, so that a certain number of offices were\r\nsuppressed altogether, much to the disgust of the office-holding class,\r\nwhich was numerous and wealthy, and had almost come to look on the civil\r\nservice as its hereditary possession. The most remarkable instance of\r\nthis policy was the discontinuance of the consulship. This great office\r\nhad remained a dignity centuries after it had ceased to be a power; but\r\nit was a very costly dignity, the holder being expected to spend large\r\nsums in public displays. As these sums were provided by the state,\r\nJustinian saved something considerable by stopping the payment. He named\r\nno consul after Basilius, who was the name-giving consul of 541.\r\n\r\nIn a bureaucratic despotism the greatest merit of a sovereign is to\r\nchoose capable and honest ministers. Justinian's selections were usually\r\ncapable, but not so often honest; probably it was hard to find\r\nthoroughly upright officials; possibly they would not have been most\r\nserviceable in carrying out the imperial will, and especially in\r\nreplenishing the imperial treasury. Even the great Tribonian labours\r\nunder the reproach of corruption, while the fact that Justinian\r\nmaintained John of Cappadocia in power long after his greed, his\r\nunscrupulousness, and the excesses of his private life had excited the\r\nanger of the whole empire, reflects little credit on his own principles\r\nof government and sense of duty to his subjects. The department of\r\nadministration in which he seems to have felt most personal interest was\r\nthat of public works. He spent immense sums on buildings of all sorts,\r\non quays and harbours, on fortifications, repairing the walls of cities\r\nand erecting castles in Thrace to check the inroads of the barbarians,\r\non aqueducts, on monasteries, above all, upon churches. Of these works\r\nonly two remain perfect, St Sophia in Constantinople, now a mosque, and\r\none of the architectural wonders of the world, and the church of SS\r\nSergius and Bacchus, now commonly called Little St Sophia, which stands\r\nabout half a mile from the great church, and is in its way a very\r\ndelicate and beautiful piece of work. The church of S. Vitale at\r\nRavenna, though built in Justinian's reign, and containing mosaic\r\npictures of him and Theodora, does not appear to have owed anything to\r\nhis mind or purse.\r\n\r\n3. Justinian's ecclesiastical policy was so complex and varying that it\r\nis impossible within the limits of this article to do more than indicate\r\nits bare outlines. For many years before the accession of his uncle\r\nJustin, the Eastern world had been vexed by the struggles of the\r\nMonophysite party, who recognized only one nature in Christ, against the\r\nview which then and ever since has maintained itself as orthodox, that\r\nthe divine and human natures coexisted in Him. The latter doctrine had\r\ntriumphed at the council of Chalcedon, and was held by the whole Western\r\nChurch, but Egypt, great part of Syria and Asia Minor, and a\r\nconsiderable minority even in Constantinople clung to Monophysitism. The\r\nemperors Zeno and Anastasius had been strongly suspected of it, and the\r\nRoman bishops had refused to communicate with the patriarchs of\r\nConstantinople since 484, when they had condemned Acacius for accepting\r\nthe formula of conciliation issued by Zeno. One of Justinian's first\r\npublic acts was to put an end to this schism by inducing Justin to make\r\nthe then patriarch renounce this formula and declare his full adhesion\r\nto the creed of Chalcedon. When he himself came to the throne he\r\nendeavoured to persuade the Monophysites to come in by summoning some of\r\ntheir leaders to a conference. This failing, he ejected suspected\r\nprelates, and occasionally persecuted them, though with far less\r\nseverity than that applied to the heretics of a deeper dye, such as\r\nMontanists or even Arians. Not long afterwards, his attention having\r\nbeen called to the spread of Origenistic opinions in Syria, he issued an\r\nedict condemning fourteen propositions drawn from the writings of the\r\ngreat Alexandrian, and caused a synod to be held under the presidency\r\nof Mennas (whom he had named patriarch of Constantinople), which renewed\r\nthe condemnation of the impugned doctrines and anathematized Origen\r\nhimself. Still later, he was induced by the machinations of some of the\r\nprelates who haunted his court, and by the influence of Theodora,\r\nherself much interested in theological questions, and more than\r\nsuspected of Monophysitism, to raise a needless, mischievous, and\r\nprotracted controversy. The Monophysites sometimes alleged that they\r\ncould not accept the decrees of the council of Chalcedon because that\r\ncouncil had not condemned, but (as they argued) virtually approved,\r\nthree writers tainted with Nestorian principles, Theodore of Mopsuestia,\r\nTheodoret, and Ibas, bishop of Edessa. It was represented to the\r\nemperor, who was still pursued by the desire to bring back the\r\nschismatics, that a great step would have been taken towards\r\nreconciliation if a condemnation of these teachers, or rather of such of\r\ntheir books as were complained of, could be brought about, since then\r\nthe Chalcedonian party would be purged from any appearance of sympathy\r\nwith the errors of Nestorius. Not stopping to reflect that in the angry\r\nand suspicious state of men's minds he was sure to lose as much in one\r\ndirection as he would gain in the other, Justinian entered into the\r\nidea, and put forth an edict exposing and denouncing the errors\r\ncontained in the writings of Theodore generally, in the treatise of\r\nTheodoret against Cyril of Alexandria, and in a letter of Bishop Ibas (a\r\nletter whose authenticity was doubted, but which passed under his name)\r\nto the Persian bishop Maris. This edict was circulated through the\r\nChristian world to be subscribed by the bishops. The four Eastern\r\npatriarchs, and the great majority of the Eastern prelates generally,\r\nsubscribed, though reluctantly, for it was felt that a dangerous\r\nprecedent was being set when dead authors were anathematized, and that\r\nthis new movement could hardly fail to weaken the authority of the\r\ncouncil of Chalcedon. Among the Western bishops, who were less disposed\r\nboth to Monophysitism and to subservience, and especially by those of\r\nAfrica, the edict was earnestly resisted. When it was found that Pope\r\nVigilius did not forthwith comply, he was summoned to Constantinople.\r\nEven there he resisted, not so much, it would seem, from any scruples of\r\nhis own, for he was not a high-minded man, as because he knew that he\r\ndared not return to Italy if he gave way. Long disputes and negotiations\r\nfollowed, the end of which was that Justinian summoned a general council\r\nof the church, that which we reckon the Fifth, which condemned the\r\nimpugned writings, and anathematized several other heretical authors.\r\nIts decrees were received in the East but long contested in the Western\r\nChurch, where a schism arose that lasted for seventy years. This is the\r\ncontroversy known as that of the Three Chapters (_Tria capitula_,\r\n[Greek: tria kephalaia]), apparently from the three propositions or\r\ncondemnations contained in Justinian's original edict, one relating to\r\nTheodore's writings and person, the second to the incriminated treatise\r\nof Theodoret (whose person was not attacked), the third to the letter\r\n(if genuine) of Ibas (see Hefele, _Conciliengeschichte_, ii. 777).\r\n\r\nAt the very end of his long career of theological discussion, Justinian\r\nhimself lapsed into heresy, by accepting the doctrine that the earthly\r\nbody of Christ was incorruptible, insensible to the weaknesses of the\r\nflesh, a doctrine which had been advanced by Julian, bishop of\r\nHalicarnassus, and went by the name of Aphthartodocetism. According to\r\nhis usual practice, he issued an edict enforcing this view, and\r\nrequiring all patriarchs, metropolitans, and bishops to subscribe to it.\r\nSome, who not unnaturally held that it was rank Monophysitism, refused\r\nat once, and were deprived of their sees, among them Eutychius the\r\neminent patriarch of Constantinople. Others submitted or temporized; but\r\nbefore there had been time enough for the matter to be carried through,\r\nthe emperor died, having tarnished if not utterly forfeited by this last\r\nerror the reputation won by a life devoted to the service of Orthodoxy.\r\n\r\nAs no preceding sovereign had been so much interested in church affairs,\r\nso none seems to have shown so much activity as a persecutor both of\r\npagans and of heretics. He renewed with additional stringency the laws\r\nagainst both these classes. The former embraced a large part of the\r\nrural population in certain secluded districts, such as parts of Asia\r\nMinor and Peloponnesus; and we are told that the efforts directed\r\nagainst them resulted in the forcible baptism of 70,000 persons in Asia\r\nMinor alone. Paganism, however, survived; we find it in Laconia in the\r\nend of the 9th century, and in northern Syria it has lasted till our own\r\ntimes. There were also a good many crypto-pagans among the educated\r\npopulation of the capital. Procopius, for instance, if he was not\r\nactually a Pagan, was certainly very little of a Christian. Inquiries\r\nmade in the third year of Justinian's reign drove nearly all of these\r\npersons into an outward conformity, and their offspring seem to have\r\nbecome ordinary Christians. At Athens, the philosophers who taught in\r\nthe schools hallowed by memories of Plato still openly professed what\r\npassed for Paganism, though it was really a body of moral doctrine,\r\nstrongly tinged with mysticism, in which there was far more of\r\nChristianity and of the speculative metaphysics of the East than of the\r\nold Olympian religion. Justinian, partly from religious motives, partly\r\nbecause he discountenanced all rivals to the imperial university of\r\nConstantinople, closed these Athenian schools (529). The professors\r\nsought refuge at the court of Chosroes, king of Persia, but were soon so\r\nmuch disgusted by the ideas and practices of the fire-worshippers that\r\nthey returned to the empire, Chosroes having magnanimously obtained from\r\nJustinian a promise that they should be suffered to pass the rest of\r\ntheir days unmolested. Heresy proved more obstinate. The severities\r\ndirected against the Montanists of Phrygia led to a furious war, in\r\nwhich most of the sectaries perished, while the doctrine was not\r\nextinguished. Harsh laws provoked the Samaritans to a revolt, from whose\r\neffects Palestine had not recovered when conquered by the Arabs in the\r\nfollowing century. The Nestorians and the Eutychian Monophysites were\r\nnot threatened with such severe civil penalties, although their worship\r\nwas interdicted, and their bishops were sometimes banished; but this\r\nvexatious treatment was quite enough to keep them disaffected, and the\r\nrapidity of the Mahommedan conquests may be partly traced to that\r\nalienation of the bulk of the Egyptian and a large part of the Syrian\r\npopulation which dates from Justinian's persecutions.\r\n\r\n4. Justinian was engaged in three great foreign wars, two of them of his\r\nown seeking, the third a legacy which nearly every emperor had come into\r\nfor three centuries, the secular strife of Rome and Persia. The Sassanid\r\nkings of Persia ruled a dominion which extended from the confines of\r\nSyria to those of India, and from the straits of Oman to the Caucasus.\r\nThe martial character of their population made them formidable enemies\r\nto the Romans, whose troops were at this epoch mainly barbarians, the\r\nsettled and civilized subjects of the empire being as a rule averse from\r\nwar. When Justinian came to the throne, his troops were maintaining an\r\nunequal struggle on the Euphrates against the armies of Kavadh I.\r\n(q.v.). After some campaigns, in which the skill of Belisarius obtained\r\nconsiderable successes, a peace was concluded in 533 with Chosroes I.\r\n(q.v.). This lasted till 539, when Chosroes declared war, alleging that\r\nJustinian had been secretly intriguing against him with the Hephthalite\r\nHuns, and doubtless moved by alarm and envy at the victories which the\r\nRomans had been gaining in Italy. The emperor was too much occupied in\r\nthe West to be able adequately to defend his eastern frontier. Chosroes\r\nadvanced into Syria with little resistance, and in 540 captured Antioch,\r\nthen the greatest city in Asia, carrying off its inhabitants into\r\ncaptivity. The war continued with varying fortunes for four years more\r\nin this quarter; while in the meantime an even fiercer struggle had\r\nbegun in the mountainous region inhabited by the Lazi at the\r\nsouth-eastern corner of the Black Sea (see COLCHIS). When after\r\ntwo-and-twenty years of fighting no substantial advantage had been\r\ngained by either party, Chosroes agreed in 562 to a peace which left\r\nLazica to the Romans, but under the dishonourable condition of their\r\npaying 30,000 pieces of gold annually to the Persian king. Thus no\r\nresult of permanent importance flowed from these Persian wars, except\r\nthat they greatly weakened the Roman Empire, increased Justinian's\r\nfinancial embarrassments, and prevented him from prosecuting with\r\nsufficient vigour his enterprises in the West. (See further PERSIA:\r\n_Ancient History_, \"The Sassanid Dynasty.\")\r\n\r\nThese enterprises had begun in 533 with an attack on the Vandals, who\r\nwere then reigning in Africa. Belisarius, despatched from Constantinople\r\nwith a large fleet and army, landed without opposition, and destroyed\r\nthe barbarian power in two engagements. North Africa from beyond the\r\nstraits of Gibraltar to the Syrtes became again a Roman province,\r\nalthough the Moorish tribes of the interior maintained a species of\r\nindependence; and part of southern Spain was also recovered for the\r\nempire. The ease with which so important a conquest had been effected\r\nencouraged Justinian to attack the Ostrogoths of Italy, whose kingdom,\r\nthough vast in extent, for it included part of south-eastern Gaul,\r\nRaetia, Dalmatia and part of Pannonia, as well as Italy, Sicily,\r\nSardinia and Corsica, had been grievously weakened by the death first of\r\nthe great Theodoric, and some years later of his grandson Athalaric, so\r\nthat the Gothic nation was practically without a head. Justinian began\r\nthe war in 535, taking as his pretext the murder of Queen Amalasuntha,\r\ndaughter of Theodoric, who had placed herself under his protection, and\r\nalleging that the Ostrogothic kingdom had always owned a species of\r\nallegiance to the emperor at Constantinople. There was some foundation\r\nfor this claim, although of course it could not have been made effective\r\nagainst Theodoric, who was more powerful than his supposed suzerain.\r\nBelisarius, who had been made commander of the Italian expedition,\r\noverran Sicily, reduced southern Italy, and in 536 occupied Rome. Here\r\nhe was attacked in the following year by Vitiges, who had been chosen\r\nking by the Goths, with a greatly superior force. After a siege of over\r\na year, the energy, skill, and courage of Belisarius, and the sickness\r\nwhich was preying on the Gothic troops, obliged Vitiges to retire.\r\nBelisarius pursued his diminished army northwards, shut him up in\r\nRavenna, and ultimately received the surrender of that impregnable city.\r\nVitiges was sent prisoner to Constantinople, where Justinian treated\r\nhim, as he had previously treated the captive Vandal king, with\r\nclemency. The imperial administration was established through Italy, but\r\nits rapacity soon began to excite discontent, and the kernel of the\r\nGothic nation had not submitted. After two short and unfortunate reigns,\r\nthe crown had been bestowed on Totila or Baduila, a warrior of\r\ndistinguished abilities, who by degrees drove the imperial generals and\r\ngovernors out of Italy. Belisarius was sent against him, but with forces\r\ntoo small for the gravity of the situation. He moved from place to place\r\nduring several years, but saw city after city captured by or open its\r\ngates to Totila, till only Ravenna, Otranto and Ancona remained.\r\nJustinian was occupied by the ecclesiastical controversy of the Three\r\nChapters, and had not the money to fit out a proper army and fleet;\r\nindeed, it may be doubted whether he would ever have roused himself to\r\nthe necessary exertions but for the presence at Constantinople of a knot\r\nof Roman exiles, who kept urging him to reconquer Italy, representing\r\nthat with their help and the sympathy of the people it would not be a\r\ndifficult enterprise. The emperor at last complied, and in 552 a\r\npowerful army was despatched under Narses, an Armenian eunuch now\r\nadvanced in life, but reputed the most skilful general of the age, as\r\nBelisarius was the hottest soldier. He marched along the coast of the\r\nGulf of Venice, and encountered the army of Totila at Taginae not far\r\nfrom Cesena. Totila was slain, and the Gothic cause irretrievably lost.\r\nThe valiant remains of the nation made another stand under Teias on the\r\nLactarian Hill in Campania; after that they disappear from history.\r\nItaly was recovered for the empire, but it was an Italy terribly\r\nimpoverished and depopulated, whose possession carried little strength\r\nwith it. Justinian's policy both in the Vandalic and in the Gothic War\r\nstands condemned by the result. The resources of the state, which might\r\nbetter have been spent in defending the northern frontier against Slavs\r\nand Huns and the eastern frontier against Persians, were consumed in the\r\nconquest of two countries which had suffered too much to be of any\r\nsubstantial value, and which, separated by language as well as by\r\nintervening seas, could not be permanently retained. However, Justinian\r\nmust have been almost preternaturally wise to have foreseen this: his\r\nconduct was in the circumstances only what might have been expected from\r\nan ambitious prince who perceived an opportunity of recovering\r\nterritories that had formerly belonged to the empire, and over which its\r\nrights were conceived to be only suspended.\r\n\r\nBesides these three great foreign wars, Justinian's reign was troubled\r\nby a constant succession of border inroads, especially on the northern\r\nfrontier, where the various Slavonic and Hunnish tribes who were\r\nestablished along the lower Danube and on the north coast of the Black\r\nSea made frequent marauding expeditions into Thrace and Macedonia,\r\nsometimes penetrating as far as the walls of Constantinople in one\r\ndirection and the Isthmus of Corinth in another. Immense damage was\r\ninflicted by these marauders on the subjects of the empire, who seem to\r\nhave been mostly too peaceable to defend themselves, and whom the\r\nemperor could not spare troops enough to protect. Fields were laid\r\nwaste, villages burnt, large numbers of people carried into captivity;\r\nand on one occasion the capital was itself in danger.\r\n\r\n5. It only remains to say something regarding Justinian's personal\r\ncharacter and capacities, with regard to which a great diversity of\r\nopinion has existed among historians. The civilians, looking on him as a\r\npatriarch of their science, have as a rule extolled his wisdom and\r\nvirtues; while ecclesiastics of the Roman Church, from Cardinal Baronius\r\ndownwards, have been offended by his arbitrary conduct towards the\r\npopes, and by his last lapse into heresy, and have therefore been\r\ndisposed to accept the stories which ascribe to him perfidy, cruelty,\r\nrapacity and extravagance. The difficulty of arriving at a fair\r\nconclusion is increased by the fact that Procopius, who is our chief\r\nauthority for the events of his reign, speaks with a very different\r\nvoice in his secret memoirs (the _Anecdota_) from that which he has used\r\nin his published history, and that some of the accusations contained in\r\nthe former work are so rancorous and improbable that a certain measure\r\nof discredit attaches to everything which it contains. The truth seems\r\nto be that Justinian was not a great ruler in the higher sense of the\r\nword, that is to say, a man of large views, deep insight, a capacity for\r\nforming just such plans as the circumstances needed, and carrying them\r\nout by a skilful adaptation of means to ends. But he was a man of\r\nconsiderable abilities, wonderful activity of mind, and admirable\r\nindustry. He was interested in many things, and threw himself with\r\nardour into whatever he took up; he contrived schemes quickly, and\r\npushed them on with an energy which usually made them succeed when no\r\nlong time was needed, for, if a project was delayed, there was a risk of\r\nhis tiring of it and dropping it. Although vain and full of\r\nself-confidence, he was easily led by those who knew how to get at him,\r\nand particularly by his wife. She exercised over him that influence\r\nwhich a stronger character always exercises over a weaker, whatever\r\ntheir respective positions; and unfortunately it was seldom a good\r\ninfluence, for Theodora (q.v.) seems to have been a woman who, with all\r\nher brilliant gifts of intelligence and manner, had no principles and no\r\npity. Justinian was rather quick than strong or profound; his policy\r\ndoes not strike one as the result of deliberate and well-considered\r\nviews, but dictated by the hopes and fancies of the moment. His activity\r\nwas in so far a misfortune as it led him to attempt too many things at\r\nonce, and engage in undertakings so costly that oppression became\r\nnecessary to provide the funds for them. Even his devotion to work,\r\nwhich excites our admiration, in the centre of a luxurious court, was to\r\na great extent unprofitable, for it was mainly given to theological\r\ncontroversies which neither he nor any one else could settle. Still,\r\nafter making all deductions, it is plain that the man who accomplished\r\nso much, and kept the whole world so occupied, as Justinian did during\r\nthe thirty-eight years of his reign, must have possessed no common\r\nabilities. He was affable and easy of approach to all his subjects, with\r\na pleasant address; nor does he seem to have been, like his wife, either\r\ncruel or revengeful. We hear several times of his sparing those who had\r\nconspired against him. But he was not scrupulous in the means he\r\nemployed, and he was willing to maintain in power detestable ministers\r\nif only they served him efficiently and filled his coffers. His chief\r\npassion, after that for his own fame and glory, seems to have been for\r\ntheology and religion; it was in this field that his literary powers\r\nexerted themselves (for he wrote controversial treatises and hymns), and\r\nhis taste also, for among his numerous buildings the churches are those\r\non which he spent most thought and money. Considering that his legal\r\nreforms are those by which his name is mainly known to posterity, it is\r\ncurious that we should have hardly any information as to his legal\r\nknowledge, or the share which he took in those reforms. In person he was\r\nsomewhat above the middle height, well-shaped, with plenty of fresh\r\ncolour in his cheeks, and an extraordinary power of doing without food\r\nand sleep. He spent most of the night in reading or writing, and would\r\nsometimes go for a day with no food but a few green herbs. Two mosaic\r\nfigures of him exist at Ravenna, one in the apse of the church of S.\r\nVitale, the other in the church of S. Apollinare in Urbe; but of course\r\none cannot be sure how far in such a material the portrait fairly\r\nrepresents the original. He had no children by his marriage with\r\nTheodora, and did not marry after her decease. On his death, which took\r\nplace on the 14th of November 565, the crown passed to his nephew Justin\r\nII.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--For the life of Justinian the chief authorities are\r\n  Procopius (_Historiae, De aedificiis, Anecdota_) and (from 552 A.D.)\r\n  the _History_ of Agathias; the Chronicle of Johannes Malalas is also\r\n  of value. Occasional reference must be made to the writings of\r\n  Jordanes and Marcellinus, and even to the late compilations of\r\n  Cedrenus and Zonaras. The _Vita Justiniani_ of Ludewig or Ludwig\r\n  (Halle, 1731), a work of patient research, is frequently referred to\r\n  by Gibbon in his important chapters relating to the reign of\r\n  Justinian, in the _Decline and Fall_ (see Bury's edition, 1900). There\r\n  is a _Vie de Justinien_ by Isambert (2 vols., Paris, 1856). See also\r\n  Hutton's _Church of the Sixth Century_ (1897); J. B.
