Of\r\nsuch stuff are our Arctic and African explorers made; the men who run\r\nthe lightning-expresses have a touch of it; it crops out in\r\nsteeple-climbers, cave-explorers, beast-tamers; it makes men assault\r\ncloud-piercing and ice-mantled mountain-peaks and launch their frail\r\ncanoes for voyages down earth-riving canons and across continent\r\nsundering oceans. Sometimes action is denied, and then it strikes in and\r\nmakes poets--perhaps the most daring adventurers of all. It must be\r\ndifficult for the beaters of iron and the barterers in swine to\r\nunderstand why such useless timber is allowed to cumber the great\r\nworkhouse; but then we don't know _exactly_ what the trilobites were\r\ngood for, and the utilitarians may find comfort in the reflection that\r\nat the present rate the obnoxious family is likely to entirely disappear\r\nwith the Palaeozoic.\r\n\r\nAeronauts have been free and accepted members of this order of modern\r\nknights-errant, from hot-headed, ill-fated Pilatre de Rozier down to\r\nGaston Tissandier, the man who still edits _La Nature_ in the lower\r\nstrata of an ocean into the treacherous upper depths of which he has\r\nrisen seven miles. Your true aeronaut is not an inventor of\r\nflying-machines, not much concerned about what is known as the \"problem\r\nof aerial navigation.\" He is content to take the wings of the morning\r\nand be carried away to the uttermost parts of the earth. Problems he\r\nleaves to the scientists: he wooes the wilderness he cannot subdue. He\r\nis an explorer of unknown regions, a beauty-worshipper at a shrine whose\r\npearly, sun-kissed portals open to him alone. People travel thousands of\r\nmiles horizontally to rest their eyes on scenes infinitely less novel,\r\nbeautiful and grand than one perpendicular mile of vantage would open to\r\nthem, little matter whence taken.\r\n\r\nHaving accepted the wind for his pilot, our argonaut seeks no\r\nimprovement upon his aerial raft. Like the bow and arrow, it long ago\r\nreached perfection, and, though he may cherish some choice and secret\r\nrecipe for varnish or be the inventor of an improved valve, he generally\r\nbuilds with a birdlike reliance on instinct and tradition. Gas-bag,\r\nnetting, concentrating-ring, basket, valve, anchor, drag-rope and\r\nexploding cord,--what has the century of ballooning added to its\r\nessentials? how can coming centuries improve this perfection of\r\nsimplicity? Aerial navigation is altogether another thing. A swallow\r\ndoes not rise by displacing a volume of air whose specific gravity is\r\ngreater than its own, but by using the atmosphere as a fulcrum.\r\nOtherwise it must possess a bulk which its tiny wings would be powerless\r\nto impel against the opposing breeze. Mr. Grimley, the aeronaut, writing\r\nof some experiments he has recently been making at Montreal with an\r\ningenious arrangement of revolving fans invented by two gentlemen of\r\nthat city, says: \"The Cowan and Paje propelling and steering apparatus\r\nworked as well as could be expected, but the air will never be navigated\r\nby balloons driven by machinery. It is opposed to common sense.\" Few\r\nfully appreciate the extreme mobility of the atmosphere or the intensity\r\nof the force which wind exerts on surfaces opposed to its action. A\r\nchild with a palm-leaf fan can drive a balloon in equilibrium about at\r\nwill in an atmosphere entirely quiet, while the same balloon, under the\r\nimpulse of a lively gale, will tear itself loose from the aggregated\r\navoirdupois of all who can lay hands upon it, and wrench great branches\r\nfrom the forest giants over which it skims. Doubtless, to the\r\ndisheartening influence of a practical knowledge of the real\r\ndifficulties in the way of aerial navigation is due the fact that the\r\ngreat mass of those who have attempted it have been scientists without\r\npractice, or fools without either scientific training or experimental\r\ndata.\r\n\r\nHowever strongly, as devout utilitarians, we may feel it our duty to\r\ndisapprove, officially, of a class so little necessary to the body\r\npolitic, aeronauts are interesting talkers, being able, like\r\nShakespeare's Moor, to speak of \"most disastrous chances, of _moving_\r\naccidents by flood and field, of antres vast and deserts idle, rough\r\nquarries, rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven.\"\r\n\r\nAmong American aeronauts none possessed a larger fund of such thrilling\r\nincident or greater enthusiasm for his calling than he who recently paid\r\nthat last penalty which ever hovers over its followers--the venerable\r\nJohn Wise. His autobiography, _Through the Air_, is a prose poem on the\r\nglories of Cloudland. The following extract from a private letter\r\nwritten by him in 1876, after an aeronautical career of forty years,\r\ncomprising nearly five hundred ascensions, illustrates this enthusiasm\r\nand his views on the sanitary aspect of aeronautics: \"I claim that the\r\nballoon is the best sanitarium within the grasp of enervated humanity. I\r\ncan demonstrate its utility, by theory and by fact, for all chronic\r\ndiseases and for the improvement of the mental and physical functions.\r\nElevate a person ten or twelve thousand feet above the sea-level and his\r\nwhole texture expands: a wrinkled, cadaverous person fills out as plump\r\nas a youth. Then the beauty and magnitude of the scenery within the\r\nscope of vision exalt the mental faculties, soul and body become\r\nexhilarated, the appetite is quickened and all the symptoms of\r\nconvalescence ensue. Why, my dear friend, I am bound to ascribe my\r\nhealth and vigor at the age of over sixty-eight to my profession, and\r\nonly for that do I persist in it. When I make up my mind to rust and die\r\nI will give up balloon-ascensions.\"\r\n\r\nSince Mr. Wise was not of a nature to be easily reconciled to \"rust and\r\ndie,\" can we doubt that the great transit could have come to him at no\r\nkinder season than when it should seem but a brief pausing on his upward\r\nflight? Though it will never be known just how or when he met the end,\r\nwe may be certain that he had walked hand in hand with Death too long to\r\ngreatly dread the final embrace. May we not think of him now as feasting\r\nhis spirit on the splendid visions of that Promised Land which,\r\nMoses-like, it was permitted him to see prefigured in its earthly type?\r\nThroughout his adventures, too generally known to require more than\r\npassing allusion, one sees the same passionate devotion to the grand and\r\nsublime in sight and sensation, the same calm disregard of danger,\r\nwhether exploding his balloon at an altitude of thirteen thousand feet\r\nand coolly noting the \"fearful moaning noise caused by the air rushing\r\nthrough the network and the gas escaping above,\" preparing to test a\r\nlifelong theory of a steady easterly current by attempting to make it\r\nthe medium of crossing the Atlantic, or participating with La Mountain\r\nand others in a voyage which, begun at St. Louis at 6.30 P.M., July 1,\r\n1859, met daybreak at Fort Wayne, extended over the length of Lake Erie,\r\nincluded a view of Niagara from the altitude of a mile, and finally,\r\nafter skirmishing within thirty feet of the storm-tossed waves of Lake\r\nOntario for fifty miles and ploughing a tornado-track through a dense\r\nforest, terminated in a treetop near Sackett's Harbor, Jefferson county,\r\nNew York, at 2.20 P.M.--twelve hundred miles in nineteen hours and forty\r\nminutes! Puck's promise kept! the seven-league boots outdone!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN WISE.]\r\n\r\nUpon his son, Charles E. Wise, and his grandson, John Wise, Jr., he\r\nbestowed his skill and engrafted his enthusiasm. The latter began his\r\naeronautical career with his teens, and though not yet out of them has\r\nmade over forty ascensions. One of these excursions, made in the autumn\r\nof 1875 from Waynesburg, Greene county, Pennsylvania, sufficiently\r\ndemonstrates, if any demonstration is needed, that a boy's luck and\r\npluck are equal to anything. It had been raining the proverbial\r\npitchforks all day, and the hydrogen oozed into the gas-bag with even\r\nmore than its accustomed sluggishness. The curiosity of a country crowd\r\nwas not easily damped, however, and the basket was finally attached and\r\nMaster Johnny stepped on board. The aerostat sensibly refused to\r\nconsider the proposition for an ascension, although urged by the\r\nsuccessive relinquishment of barometer, lunch, water-bottle, coat,\r\ndrag-rope and grapnel. As a last resort, the entire lower third of the\r\ngas-bag, which was uninflated, was cut away, the valve-cord by accident\r\nsharing the same fate, leaving an opening about seventeen feet in\r\ndiameter. Then, \"the crowd having given us room, father asked me whether\r\nI felt timid about going. I told him I was determined to go if the\r\nballoon would take me. He said, 'Good-bye, Johnny:' I said, 'Good-bye,'\r\nand found myself shooting up into space on a cold, rainy October day,\r\ncoatless, without ropes, anchor or valve-cord, the rags of the balloon\r\nfluttering in the breeze created by the sudden ascent; the multitude\r\nvociferously cheering me one moment and the next calling me to come back\r\nfor God's sake! But I only replied by hurrahing and waving my hat,\r\nfeeling perfectly _cool_, and rather enjoying the excitement of the vast\r\ncrowd that was now fast disappearing below me. In seven minutes the\r\nearth vanished from my sight, and I passed from a driving rain below the\r\nclouds into a dense snowstorm above them. My feet and hands were almost\r\nnumb with cold, and the prospect was about as cheerless as it well could\r\nbe, when a thought passed through my brain that made me laugh outright.\r\nI had heard of people coming down in bursted balloons, but I was the\r\nfirst who had ever gone up in one. The idea appeared so ridiculous that\r\nit really made me feel warmer.\" Think of this aerial babe in the woods,\r\nwith Nature's awful forces warring about him and the earth lost to view,\r\nlaughing himself warm over a joke at the expense of his terrible\r\nsituation! Truly, \"he jests at scars that never felt a wound.\" Perhaps\r\nit was the balloon, but I believe it could only have been his good\r\nangel, that brought the boy safely down into a small cleared space in a\r\nforest thirty-eight minutes and forty miles from the point of departure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WASHINGTON H. DONALDSON.]\r\n\r\nAnother of Master John's voyages curiously illustrates the different\r\ndirections of coexistent currents. On July 4, 1878, he made an\r\nascension from Lancaster, Pennsylvania, landing ten miles south of the\r\ncity, while J.M. Johnston, of the _Lancaster Intelligencer_, who\r\nascended in another balloon at the same moment, came down at a point\r\nequally distant in an exactly opposite direction from the city.\r\n\r\nWith the name of John Wise that of another aeronaut equally well known\r\nis associated--not alone by their joint attempt to cross the Atlantic by\r\nballoon, but also on account of the probably identical manner and\r\nlocality of the death of both--Washington H. Donaldson. While the\r\ninterest in the mysterious fate of Donaldson and Grimwood was yet fresh\r\nin the public mind Mr. Wise published a pamphlet giving a fanciful\r\naccount of their adventures, as if related by the aeronaut. In the light\r\nof the Wise-Burr tragedy its concluding paragraph has a singular\r\nsignificance: \"In the end I ask the world to deal charitably with me.\r\nShould my body be found, give it decent burial and write for an epitaph:\r\n'Here lies the body of a man whose reckless ambition and fear of being\r\naccused of want of nerve have sacrificed his own life and betrayed a\r\nfellow-mortal into the snares of death, with no higher object than to\r\nserve the interests of a scheme which, to say the best of it, is but a\r\npoor thing in the progress of art and refinement.'\"\r\n\r\nDonaldson was a man in many respects remarkable, in some admirable. With\r\nscant schooling, his father gave him a thorough training as a\r\ndraughtsman and engraver. Allowed to choose for himself, he embarked in\r\nthe amusement business, his active and versatile temperament leading him\r\nto become in turn a rope-walker, gymnast, actor, ventriloquist and,\r\nsingularly enough, electro-physician. For most of these varied callings\r\nhe had a certain adaptability by reason of his splendid physique,\r\nperfect health, entire abstinence from stimulants, ready wit,\r\ngood-humor, fertility in expedients and promptitude and energy in\r\nexecution, as well as by the daring and ambition naturally associated\r\nwith such physical and mental qualifications. A friend writes of him:\r\n\"He was as ready to navigate a cockle-shell from the Battery to Long\r\nBranch as he was to run a velocipede along a hundred yards of slack\r\nwire.\" His drawings, particularly those illustrating aeronautical scenes\r\nand incidents, were spirited and faithful. He tried his hand at\r\nverse-making among the rest. The following brief outburst, written after\r\nall the old loves had given place to that which became the absorbing\r\npassion of his life, and printed on his letter-heads and\r\nadmission-cards, sufficiently illustrates the manner and matter of his\r\nefforts in this direction:\r\n\r\n    There's pleasure in a lively trip when sailing through the air.\r\n    The word is given, \"Let her go!\"--to land I know not where.\r\n    The view is grand: 'tis like a dream when many miles from home:\r\n    My castle in the air I love, above the clouds to roam.\r\n\r\nNot an ideal character certainly, but a complete one in its way, and\r\nreadily recognizable as belonging to a born aeronaut. The unromantic but\r\nnot unusual inability of a professional predecessor to pay his\r\nboard-bill, obliging him to leave his balloon with mine host as surety,\r\nfirst placed in Donaldson's hands the means by which he became afterward\r\nbest known. Fearless as he undoubtedly was, an ascension was undertaken\r\nwith the misgivings which usually preface an initial stepping from terra\r\nfirma to the inconstant air. Once aloft, however, with the widespreading\r\nsplendor and endless immensity of the earth's surface unrolling beneath\r\nhim, and an exquisite physical exhilaration thrilling along his nerves,\r\nDonaldson became heart and soul an aeronaut. The novel and sensational\r\nexpedients with which he embellished his subsequent ascensions are well\r\nknown. Becomingly dressed in tights, he delighted to sail away skyward\r\nhanging by one hand from a trapeze-bar, generally terminating a variety\r\nof feats thereon by poising himself a moment on his back, then suddenly\r\ndropping backward, catching by his feet on the side-ropes--easy and safe\r\nenough, doubtless, with his preliminary acrobatic training, but\r\nblood-curdling to the breathless spectators beneath. He left drawings\r\nfor a jointed bar which, at the proper time, should apparently break in\r\ntwo and leave him dangling to one of the pieces. For a consideration\r\nwhich the citizens of Binghamton, New York, sensibly declined to give he\r\noffered to ascend to the height of a mile in a paper balloon, there set\r\nfire to it and descend in a parachute.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DONALDSON'S DANGER.]\r\n\r\nA little incident, not generally known, illustrates the gentler side of\r\nhis nature. He had been giving one of his trapeze exhibitions at Ithaca,\r\nNew York, and was induced by some Cornell students to furnish them\r\ncaptive ascensions from the university campus. As if specially for the\r\noccasion, there came three days of delightful May weather with a\r\npropitiously quiet atmosphere. To the natural elevation of the location\r\nwere added several hundred feet of rope, affording a bird's-eye view of\r\nCayuga Lake, the town and far-famed adjacent scenery. Two or three\r\nhundred persons were \"sent up,\" including several university professors.\r\nDonaldson was in his element, and kept everybody laughing at his jokes\r\nand amusing experiments. He had a crowd of children constantly at his\r\nheels, and in the intervals of waiting for pay-passengers would tumble\r\nthem into the basket to the number of six or eight, and send them\r\nskyward screaming with delight and pelting him with a shower of hats and\r\ncaps. Did their mothers know? Probably not, or there might have been\r\nscreaming of a less joyous kind. One diminutive but intrepid youth of\r\nsix won for himself the proud distinction of \"our old experienced\r\naeronaut,\" being generally used as ballast in making up a load.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DONALDSON AND THE CHILDREN.]\r\n\r\nDonaldson's fondness for proving his nerve in the face of a doubting\r\ncrowd led him into many difficulties, as it finally caused his death.\r\nOnce, when about to make an ascension at Pittsburg with a balloon that\r\nhad not been used since the previous season, his assistant, Harry\r\nGilbert, noticed that the ropes attaching the netting to the\r\nconcentrating-ring seemed rotten, and proposed to replace them with new.\r\nThis Donaldson insisted would take too much time, but he was finally\r\ninduced to allow eight of the sixteen to be renewed. While giving his\r\ncustomary trapeze performance high above the housetops the old cords\r\nbegan to snap, and before he could bring the balloon down every one of\r\nthem had parted--a startling intimation of how his rashness might have\r\nresulted.\r\n\r\nAmong the unkilled American aeronauts undoubtedly the best known for\r\nprofessional skill and experience is Samuel A. King. He seems to have\r\nbeen a predestined air-sailor, for he made his first ascension\r\n(Philadelphia, 1851) in his twenty-third year, and during more than two\r\nhundred subsequent voyages, many of them extending over hundreds of\r\nmiles, and some adding darkness and proximity to large bodies of water\r\nto the ordinary dangers, he has shown an intuitive knowledge of the\r\nconstruction and management of the balloon and an appreciation of aerial\r\nforces which, while they have not robbed his experiences of thrilling\r\nincidents, have kept them singularly free from disastrous consequences.\r\nOne of the most memorable of these excursions was made from Plymouth,\r\nNew Hampshire, September 26, 1872, on which occasion Mr. King was\r\naccompanied by his friend and frequent fellow-voyager, Luther L. Holden,\r\nof the _Boston Journal_. The balloon used only held twenty thousand\r\ncubic feet of gas, but was inflated with hydrogen. It was liberated at\r\n4.18 P.M., and immediately manifested a determination to accompany some\r\ndense black clouds which were hurrying in a north-easterly direction\r\ntoward the heart of the mountain-region on the verge of which Plymouth\r\nlies. Over Mount Washington and across the Androscoggin Valley it flew\r\nat the rate of fifty miles an hour. At six o'clock Lake Umbagog was\r\nfloating beneath our adventurers, and before they realized their\r\ndanger--so deceptive are time and space when reckoned from\r\nballoons--night surprised them in the great Maine wilderness. The\r\nalternative was between a descent in a trackless forest a hundred miles\r\nfrom human habitation, with scant provisions and no firearms or\r\nfishing-tackle, and an all-night voyage, trusting to luck and their\r\nballast for getting beyond the wilderness. They had taken chances\r\ntogether before, and they went on now. If they failed to get out of the\r\nwoods, they could tear up the balloon, and, encasing the wicker-basket\r\nwith the waterproof material, float down some favoring stream. On and on\r\nfor hours in an unknown direction, over an unknown region, winged by the\r\nwind and ally of the storm, they went, until, in the dismal watches of\r\nthe early morning, to darkness, uncertainty and the intensity of\r\nisolation a new horror was added. The murmur of plashing forest-streams,\r\nwhich had hitherto been the only sound greeting them from the nether\r\ngloom, now gave place to the measured roll of the surf, and this, in\r\nturn, to complete silence. They were drifting out to sea, and were\r\nalready far beyond the shore! The valve was opened at once, and as the\r\nballoon slowly settled into a dense, chilly fog the occupants of the\r\nbasket momentarily expected a plunge-bath. The drag-rope, however,\r\nbehaved with distinguished consideration, holding them a few feet above\r\nthe waves, through which it whisked at a terrific rate. The weary and\r\nanxious watchers were thus kept in suspense for nearly half an hour,\r\nwhen suddenly there broke through the fog ahead the welcome outlines of\r\na forest-shore, and in a moment more the drag-rope had lifted them above\r\nthe tree-tops. By five o'clock it became light enough to note the time\r\nand that they were travelling in a south-westerly direction exactly\r\ncontrary to their course of the evening before. At seven o'clock the\r\nballoon was moored to a limb, and its passengers, climbing down the\r\ndrag-rope, made their way to a railroad-cutting which they had noticed\r\nwhile aloft. It proved to be on the line of the Intercolonial Railway in\r\nthe county of Rimouski, Lower Canada, three hundred miles below Quebec.\r\nThey had been dancing along the southern border of the Gulf of St.\r\nLawrence, and, had they not descended from the upper current into the\r\nwater, were in a fair way to have next sighted land somewhere on the\r\ncoast of Labrador.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BUFFALO IN MONUMENTAL PARK, CLEVELAND.]\r\n\r\nMr. King first brought large balloons into use in this country, and has\r\nthus been able to share the pleasures and perils of most of his sailings\r\nup and down with one or more companions, generally journalists. Few of\r\nthe balloons in use twenty-five years ago would hold more than twenty\r\nthousand cubic feet of gas. Of the large balloons the Buffalo became\r\nwidely known on account of its size and the number of notable voyages it\r\nmade. Capacity, symmetry, lightness and staying quality considered, it\r\nwas probably the best balloon ever built in America. When fully inflated\r\nit contained ninety-one thousand cubic feet of gas, and would carry up a\r\ndozen passengers. It was the Buffalo which on the memorable\r\npress-excursion from Cleveland, September 4, 1874, gave the reporters\r\nsuch a realizing sense of the pleasantness of dry land, the greater part\r\nof the day being spent in sailing to and fro over Lake Erie, the voyage\r\nbeing farther extended in the darkness of night across Essex county,\r\nOntario, Lake St. Clair and into Michigan. The writer happened to be on\r\nthe Cleveland steamer with the returning party, and had occasion to\r\nnotice that the amateurs were too busily engaged in writing up their\r\nnotes to thoroughly enjoy Mr. King's waggish allusions to\r\n\"sea-sickness.\"\r\n\r\nA night-trip made from the city of Buffalo in its namesake on July 4,\r\n1874, was noteworthy for the magnificent success attending the use of\r\nthe drag-rope. The balloon took a south-easterly course across the State\r\nof Pennsylvania, going over the Alleghany Mountains and other ridges in\r\nthe southern section of the State, being kept close to the earth most of\r\nthe way. The relief of weight caused by a portion of the drag-rope lying\r\nand trailing upon the tree-tops enabled the balloon to climb the side of\r\nthe mountain at about the same relative elevation. Swinging clear from\r\nthe crest of the ridge, the balloon would soon settle into the valley,\r\nto repeat the same manoeuvre farther on. Sunrise met the party near\r\nthe Maryland line, and after a delightful sail across a portion of that\r\nState, Delaware and Delaware Bay, a landing was made in Southern New\r\nJersey, four hundred miles and thirteen hours from the starting-point.\r\nThe Buffalo will also be remembered in connection with the ascension\r\nfrom the exposition-grounds during the Centennial Exhibition.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the costly experiments undertaken by Mr. King for the\r\nAmerican Aeronautic Society, at Coney Island last season, simply affords\r\nanother illustration of the aeronautical axiom that \"Captives are\r\nuncertain.\" Under the most favorable circumstances, and at inland points\r\nleast exposed, on perhaps not more than a dozen days in the year will\r\nthe air be sufficiently quiet to make captive ascensions practicable and\r\npleasant, and the difficulty is of course greatly enhanced at the\r\nseacoast. The society proposes to again thoroughly test the matter this\r\nseason, studying the velocity of the wind near the ocean from various\r\naltitudes.\r\n\r\nCharles H. Grimley, whose views on aerial navigation have been alluded\r\nto, is a young Englishman who, while an expert air-sailor, has gained\r\nhis experience rather in the pursuit of pleasure than of money,\r\ndedicating to the latter a more terrestrial vocation. His introduction\r\nto the upper currents was in the capacity of assistant to Stephen A.\r\nSimmonds, a wealthy enthusiast of London who made ascensions for the\r\nBritish Aeronautical Society. Mr. Grimley has made between forty and\r\nfifty aerial excursions, on one of them covering a distance of one\r\nhundred and sixty miles in three and a half hours, and on another\r\noccasion attaining a height of nineteen thousand four hundred feet. A\r\nnumber of these voyages were made in Canada. Some of his descents have\r\nresulted in severe bruises. One of these unpleasantly sudden landings\r\nclosed a brief trip made from Pittsburg in October, 1875, and took\r\nplace on the Monongahela River five miles above that city. Mr. Grimley\r\nwas accompanied by Harry Byram of the _Pittsburg Dispatch_. Two things\r\nregulate the force of impact in a balloon descent--the strength of the\r\nsurface-current and the amount of ballast the aeronaut has with which to\r\noverbalance the weight in excess of equilibrium causing the descent.\r\nBoth were against our adventurers. Most of their ballast had been\r\nexpended in getting into the air, and while they had found almost a calm\r\nat an elevation of forty-five hundred feet, the surface-current was\r\nterrific. The balloon approached the earth at an angle of about\r\nforty-five degrees with fearful velocity, flew across Beck's Run and\r\ntore into a clump of trees growing on a rocky ledge dividing the ravine\r\nfrom the river. The basket was dashed from one tree-trunk to another,\r\nand, the balloon finally impaling itself on the branches of a huge oak,\r\nboth its occupants were hurled halfway down the river-bank, the fall\r\nrendering them insensible. With returning consciousness came a sense of\r\nsundry bruises and cuts on their persons. A scalp-wound on Mr. Grimley's\r\nforehead had bled profusely upon both, imparting a sad and sanguinary\r\ncast to the countenances turned toward those who came to their\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INFLATING A BALLOON.]\r\n\r\nWhile preparing for an ascent from Bethel, Vermont, in September, 1877,\r\na squall hurled the balloon over upon its side, causing a rent which\r\nextended from the mouth upward for eighteen feet, and then along a\r\ntransverse seam some six feet. Mr. Grimley thus describes the result:\r\n\"This gaping hole caused a loss of several thousand feet of gas, but as\r\nstill enough remained to take me up, I determined to ascend, hoping that\r\nwhen I was out of the disturbing influence of the wind the rent would\r\nnot extend. In this, however, I was disappointed, for, reaching an\r\naltitude of twelve hundred feet, a counter-current struck the balloon,\r\ncausing it to sway violently and jerking the torn portion to and fro\r\nuntil it ripped six feet farther around the seam. The balloon continued\r\nto rise until it had attained an elevation of thirty-five hundred feet,\r\nthe gas meanwhile pouring in volumes from the hole. The weight of the\r\ntorn portion hanging down caused the rent to enlarge every minute, until\r\nit extended nearly halfway round, the whole interior of the balloon\r\nbeing plainly visible. I kept as still as possible, as the slightest\r\nagitation of the car tended to hasten the ripping. The balloon had\r\nslowly descended nearly a thousand feet when suddenly, with a sharp\r\ncrack, the rip extended upward about five feet more, until stopped by\r\nanother seam. I now began to be alarmed, fearing the balloon would\r\ncollapse entirely. I was over the roughest and most mountainous part of\r\nVermont, with no place in sight suitable for a landing. The balloon was\r\nfalling rapidly. I threw out everything in the car, anchor and ropes\r\nincluded, to check the descent, but to no purpose. I struck the rocky\r\nsummit of Mount Tunbridge with a crash, instantly collapsing the balloon\r\nand throwing me out of the basket, inflicting injuries from which I did\r\nnot recover for many months.\"\r\n\r\nThe press-excursions, originated, as hinted above, by Mr. King, and\r\nbrought into such prominence by Donaldson in connection with Barnum's\r\nHippodrome, produced a new and interesting class of aeronauts, peculiar,\r\nI believe, to this country and decade. The reporter is the true author,\r\nafter all. If he have the courage and enthusiasm to plunge into the most\r\nuntried and dangerous of life's paths, and the skill to transcribe his\r\nimpressions in the freshest and most vivid colors, he possesses one form\r\nof the only valid plea for a man's asking the world of readers to listen\r\nto him--unhackneyed experience.\r\n\r\nOne of Mr. Holden's adventures has been described above. After\r\nTissandier, he is doubtless the veteran journalistic aeronaut of the\r\nworld. Beginning in 1861, he has made in all twenty-six voyages, some of\r\nthem perilously eventful, including several night-flights of hundreds of\r\nmiles. Most of his experience has been gained with Mr. King, though he\r\naccompanied Donaldson on several occasions. At the request of Professor\r\nAbby of the Signal Service, Mr. Holden took frequent barometrical and\r\nhygrometrical observations in his later excursions. He has made no\r\nascensions for some years, his surplus time and enthusiasm being\r\ndiverted to European travel. The following bit of description admirably\r\nillustrates his style: \"It is a strange scene that bursts upon the\r\nvision of the balloon-passenger as he rises above the housetops and\r\ntrees. There is a moment when he beholds the thousands of upturned\r\nfaces, the throngs of people in the street, at the windows and on the\r\nhousetops, teams moving lazily hither and thither, and amid all a\r\nconfused fluttering of leaves, frightened birds, waving flags and\r\nhandkerchiefs, and a general commotion quite indescribable. But in\r\nanother moment the men become mere black spots on a field of green, the\r\nhorses and carriages are reduced to toys and the houses to the\r\ndimensions of the blocks children use at play. While all detail is\r\ndisappearing there is a seeming contraction of larger objects. Streets\r\nhave drawn nearer to each other: it is but a few steps from one\r\nextremity of a town to the other, and remote places are brought within\r\nslight distances of the objects beneath his feet.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Frank H. Taylor, of _Harpers Weekly_, has an aeronautical record\r\nsecond only to that of Mr. Holden, having been basketed on several trips\r\neach with Wise, Donaldson and King. Mr. Alfred Ford, of _The Graphic_,\r\nwho with Donaldson and Lunt started on the disastrous Transatlantic\r\nvoyage in the Graphic balloon, and Rev. H.B. Jeffries, of the\r\n_Pittsburg Leader_, who officiated at the balloon-wedding over\r\nCincinnati, are also entitled to rank as veterans. The European\r\nliterature of ballooning, with its accurate and brilliant descriptions\r\nby Glaisher, Tissandier, De Fonvielle and Dupuis-Delcour, has nothing\r\nmore graphic and absorbing than some of the accounts dashed off in the\r\nwhite heat of enthusiasm by these and other American journalists. The\r\nnervousness and chaffing before the start; the thrill and wonder of the\r\nupward rush; the strange exhilaration coming with relivening confidence;\r\nthe unspeakable loveliness and grandeur of the prospect; the thousand\r\nvaried incidents of the too-brief journey; the short, sharp excitement\r\nof the landing; the awe and curiosity of the impromptu crowd invariably\r\non the ground before the balloon, and reluctantly leaving it only when\r\nthe last whiff of gas is rolled out of it and the last rope thrown into\r\nthe wagon; the moonlight ride to the station with the gas-bag for a\r\npillow and the brain too busy with the strangeness of the day for much\r\ntalk,--all this and more, in endless diversity of circumstance and\r\ntreatment, these gentlemen have embalmed for the curious millions who\r\ncannot or will not go \"up in a balloon.\"\r\n\r\n  WILL O. BATES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADAM AND EVE.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe month of December was well advanced before Eve's letter had reached\r\nReuben May. It came to him one morning when, notwithstanding the fog\r\nwhich reigned around, Reuben had arisen in more than usually good\r\nspirits, able to laugh at his neighbors for railing against weather\r\nwhich he declared was good weather and seasonable.\r\n\r\nThe moment the postman entered the shop his heart gave a great\r\nbound--for who but Eve would write to him?--and no sooner had his eyes\r\nfallen on the handwriting than his whole being rejoiced, for surely\r\nnothing but good news could be heralded by such glad feelings. With a\r\nresolute self-denial, of which on most occasions Reuben was somewhat\r\nproud, he refused himself the immediate gratification of his desires,\r\nand with a hasty glance laid the letter on one side while he entered\r\ninto a needlessly long discussion with the postman, gossiped with a\r\ncustomer--for whose satisfaction he volunteered a minute inspection of a\r\nwatch which might have very reasonably been put off until the\r\nmorrow--and finally (there being nothing else by which the long-coveted\r\npleasure could be further delayed) he took up the letter and carefully\r\nturned it first this side and then that before breaking the seal and\r\nunfolding the paper.\r\n\r\nWhat would it say? That she was coming back--coming home? But when? how\r\nsoon? In a month? in a week? now at once? In one flash of vision Reuben\r\nsaw the furniture polished and comfortably arranged, the room smartened\r\nup and looking its best with a blazing fire and a singing kettle, and a\r\ncozy meal ready laid for two people; and then all they would have to say\r\nto one another--on his part much to hear and little to tell, for his\r\nlife had jogged on at a very commonplace trot, his business neither\r\nbetter nor worse, but still, with the aid of the little sum his more\r\nthan rigid economy had enabled him to save, they might make a fair\r\nstart, free from all debt and able to pay their way.\r\n\r\nThese thoughts only occupied the time which Reuben took to undo the\r\ncomplicated folds by which, before the days of envelopes, correspondents\r\nendeavored to baffle the curiosity of those who sought to know more than\r\nwas intended for them. But what is this? for Reuben's eyes had been so\r\ngreedy to suck up the words that he had not given his mind time to grasp\r\ntheir meaning: \"Not coming back! never--any more!\"--\"I like the place,\r\nthe people, and, above all, my relations, so very much that I should\r\nnever be happy now away from them.\"\r\n\r\nHe repeated the words over again and again before he seemed to have the\r\nleast comprehension of what they meant: then, in a stupor of dull\r\ndespondency, he read on to the end, and learnt that all his hopes were\r\nover, that his life was a blank, and that the thing he had dreaded so\r\nmuch as to cheat himself into the belief that it could never happen had\r\ncome to pass. And yet he was still Reuben May, and lived and breathed,\r\nand hadn't much concern beyond the thought of how he should best send\r\nthe things she had left to Polperro--the place she never intended to\r\nleave, the place she now could never be happy away from.\r\n\r\nLater on, a hundred wild schemes and mad desires wrestled and fought,\r\ntrying to combat with his judgment and put to flight his sense of\r\nresolution; but now, as in the first moment of death, with the vain hope\r\nof realizing his loss, the mourner sits gazing at the inanimate form\r\nbefore him, so Reuben, holding the letter in his hands, returned again\r\nand again to the words which had dealt death to his hopes and told him\r\nthat the love he lived for no longer lived for him. For Eve had been\r\nvery emphatic in enforcing this resolve, and had so strongly worded her\r\ndecision that, try as he would, Reuben could find no chink by which a\r\nray of hope might gain admittance: all was dark with the gloom of\r\ndespair, and this notwithstanding that Adam had not been mentioned, and\r\nReuben had no more certain knowledge of a rival to guide him than the\r\njaundiced workings of a jealous heart. Many events had concurred to\r\nbring about this blamable reticence. In the first place, the letter\r\nwhich Eve had commenced as a mere fulfilment of her promise had grown\r\nthrough a host of changing moods; for as time went on many a sweet and\r\nbitter found its way to that stream whose course did never yet run\r\nsmooth; and could the pages before him have presented one tithe of these\r\nvaried emotions, Reuben's sober nature would have rejoiced in the\r\ncertainty that such an excess of sensitiveness needed but time and\r\nopportunity to wear itself out.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was nearly two months now since it had been known all through the\r\nplace that Adam Pascal was keeping company with his cousin Eve, and the\r\nPolperro folk, one and all, agreed that no good could surely come of a\r\ncourtship carried on after such a contrary fashion; for the two were\r\nnever for twenty-four hours in the same mind, and the game of love\r\nseemed to resolve itself into a war of extremes wherein anger, devotion,\r\nsuspicion and jealousy raged by turns and afforded equal occasions of\r\nscandal and surprise. To add to their original difficulties, the lovers\r\nhad now to contend against the circumstances of time and place, for\r\nduring the winter, from most of the men being on shore and without\r\noccupation, conviviality and merriment were rife among them, and from\r\nBell-ringing Night, which ushered in Gun-powder Plot, until Valentine's\r\nDay was passed, revels, dances or amusements of any kind which brought\r\npeople together were welcomed and well attended. With the not unnatural\r\ndesire to get away from her own thoughts, and to avoid as much as was\r\npossible the opportunity of being a looker-on at happiness in which she\r\nhad no personal share, Joan greedily availed herself of every\r\ninvitation which was given or could be got at, and, as was to be\r\nexpected, Eve, young, fresh and a novice, became to a certain degree\r\ninfected with the anxiety to participate in most of these amusements.\r\nAdam made no objection, and, though he did not join them with much\r\nspirit and alacrity, he neither by word nor deed threw any obstacle in\r\ntheir way to lessen their anticipation or spoil their pleasure, while\r\nJerrem, head, chief and master of ceremonies, found in these occasions\r\nample opportunity for trying Adam's jealousy and tickling Eve's vanity.\r\n\r\nNettled by the indifference which, from her open cordiality, Jerrem soon\r\nsaw Eve felt toward him, he taxed every art of pleasing to its utmost,\r\nwith the determination of not being baffled in his attempts to supplant\r\nAdam, who in Jerrem's eyes was a man upon whom Fortune had lavished her\r\nchoicest favors. Born in Polperro, Zebedee's son, heir to the Lottery,\r\ncaptain of her now in all but name, what had Adam to desire? while he,\r\nJerrem, belonged to no one, could claim no one, had no name and could\r\nnot say where he came from. Down in the depths of a heart in which\r\nnothing that was good or bad ever lingered long Jerrem let this fester\r\nrankle, until often, when he seemed most gay and reckless, some\r\nthoughtless word or idle joke would set it smarting. The one\r\ncompensation he looked upon as given to him above Adam was the power of\r\nattraction, by which he could supplant him with others and rob him of\r\ntheir affection; so that, though he was no more charmed by Eve's rare\r\nbeauty than he was won by her coy modesty, no sooner did he see that\r\nAdam's affection was turned toward her than he coveted her love and\r\ndesired to boast of it as being his own. With this object in view, he\r\nbegan by enlisting Eve's sympathies with his forlorn position, inferring\r\na certain similarity in their orphaned condition which might well lead\r\nher to bestow upon him her especial interest and regard; and so well was\r\nthis part played that before long Eve found herself learning\r\nunconsciously to regard Adam as severe and unyielding toward Jerrem,\r\nwhose misfortune it was to be too easily influenced. Seeing her strong\r\nin her own rectitude and no less convinced of the truth of Jerrem's\r\nwell-intentioned resolutions, Adam felt it next to impossible to poison\r\nEve's ears with tales and scandals of which her innocent life led her to\r\nhave no suspicion: therefore, though the sight of their slightest\r\nintercourse rankled within him, he was forced to keep silent, knowing as\r\nhe did that if he so much as pointed an arrow every head was wagged at\r\nhim, and if he dared to let it fly home every tongue was ready to cry\r\nshame on his treachery.\r\n\r\nSo the winter wore away, and as each day lengthened Adam found it more\r\ndifficult to master his suspicions, to contend with his surroundings and\r\nto control the love which had taken complete hold and mastery of all his\r\nsenses. With untiring anxiety he continued to dodge every movement of\r\nJerrem and Eve--all those about him noting it, laughing over it, and,\r\nwhile they thwarted and tricked him, making merry at his expense, until\r\nJerrem, growing bolder under such auspicious countenance no longer\r\nhesitated to throw a very decided air of lovemaking into his hitherto\r\ninnocent and friendly intercourse.\r\n\r\nShocked and pained by Jerrem's altered tone, Eve sought refuge in Joan's\r\nbroader experience by begging that she would counsel her as to the best\r\nway of putting a stop to this ungenerous conduct.\r\n\r\n\"Awh, my dear,\" cried Joan, \"unless you'm wantin' to see murder in the\r\nhouse you mustn't braithe no word of it. 'Tw'ud be worse than death to\r\nJerrem if't should iver come to Adam's ears: why, he'd have his life if\r\nhe swung gallows-high for takin' of it. So, like a good maid, keep it\r\nfrom un now, 'cos they'm all on the eve o' startin', and by the time\r\nthey comes home agen Jerrem 'ull have forgot all about 'ee.\"\r\n\r\nEve hesitated: \"I told him if ever he spoke like that to me again I'd\r\ntell Adam.\"\r\n\r\n\"Iss, but you won't do it, though,\" returned Joan, \"'cos there ain't no\r\nmanin' in what he says, you knaw. 'Tis only what he's told up to scores\r\nand hunderds o' other maidens afore, the rapskallion-rogued raskil! And\r\nthat Adam knaws, and's had it in his mind from' fust along what game he\r\nwas after. Us two knaws un for what he is, my dear--wan best loved where\r\nhe's least trusted.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's so different to the men I've ever had to do with,\" said Eve.\r\n\r\n\"Iss, but you never knawed but wan afore you comed here, did 'ee?\"\r\n\r\n\"I only knew one man well,\" returned Eve.\r\n\r\n\"Awh, then, you must bide a bit 'fore you can fathom their deepness,\"\r\nreplied Joan; \"and while you'm waitin' I wouldn't advise 'ee to take it\r\nfor granted that the world's made up o' Reuben Mays--nor Adam Pascals\r\nneither;\" and she ran to the door to welcome a cousin for whose approach\r\nshe had been waiting, while Eve, worried and perplexed, let her thoughts\r\nrevert to the old friend who seemed to have quite forgotten her; for\r\nReuben had sent no answer to Eve's letter, and thus had afforded no\r\nopportunity for the further announcement she had intended making. His\r\nsilence, interpreted by her into indifference, had hurt her more than\r\nshe liked owning, even to herself; and the confession of their mutual\r\npromise, which she had intended making to Adam, was still withheld,\r\nbecause her vanity forbade her to speak of a man whose affection she had\r\nundoubtedly overrated.\r\n\r\nAlready there had been some talk of the furniture being sent for, and\r\nwith this in view the next time she saw Sammy Tucker she asked him if he\r\nhad been to Fowey lately, and if he had seen anything of Captain Triggs.\r\n\r\nSammy, as was his wont, blushed up to the eyes before he stammered out\r\nsomething about having met \"un just for a minit comin' down by Place,\r\n'cos he'd bin up there to fetch sommit he was goin' to car'y to London\r\nfor Squire Trefry; but that was a brave bit agone, so, p'r'aps,\" added\r\nSammy, \"he's back by now, 'cos they wos a-startin' away that ebenin'.\"\r\n\r\nEve made no other remark, and Sammy turned away, not sorry to escape\r\nfurther interrogation, for it had so happened that the opportunity\r\nalluded to had been turned by Sammy to the best advantage, and he had\r\ncontrived in the space of ten minutes to put Captain Triggs in\r\npossession of the whole facts of Adam and Eve's courtship, adding that\r\n\"Folks said 'twas a burnin' shame o'he to marry she, and Joan Hocken\r\nfo'ced to stand by and look on; and her's\" (indicating by his thumb it\r\nwas his stepmother he meant) \"ha' tooked on tar'ible bad, and bin as\r\nmoody-hearted as could be ever since.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Triggs nodded his head in sympathy, and then went on his way\r\nwith the intuitive conviction that this bit of news, which he intended\r\nrepeating to \"thickee chap in London,\" would not be received with\r\nwelcome. \"However,\" he reflected, \"'tis allays best to knaw the warst,\r\nso I shall tell un the fust time I meets un, which is safe to be afore\r\nlong, 'cos o'the ole gentleman,\" meaning thereby an ancient silver watch\r\nthrough whose medium Captain Triggs and Reuben had struck up an\r\nintimacy. How Reuben blessed that watch and delighted in those ancient\r\nworks which would not go, and so afforded him an opportunity for at\r\nleast one visit!\r\n\r\nEach time the Mary Jane came to London, Reuben was made acquainted with\r\nthe fact, and the following evening found him in the little cabin poring\r\nover the intricacies of his antique friend, whose former capabilities,\r\nwhen in the possession of his father, Captain Triggs was never weary of\r\nrecounting.\r\n\r\nStanding behind Reuben, Triggs would nod and chuckle at each fresh\r\ndifficulty that presented itself, delighting in the proud certainty that\r\nafter all the London chap \"'ud find the ole gentleman had proved wan too\r\nmany for he;\" and when Reuben, desirous of further information, would\r\nprepare his way for the next visit by declaring he must have another try\r\nat him, Triggs, radiant but magnanimous, would answer, \"Iss, iss, lad,\r\ndo 'ee come agen; for 'tis aisy to see with half a eye that 'tain't wan\r\nlook, nor two neither, that 'ull circumnavigate the insides o' that ole\r\nchap if 'taint to his liken to be set agoin'.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was some weeks after the receipt of Eve's letter that Reuben, having\r\npaid several fruitless visits to Kay's Wharf, walked down one afternoon\r\nto find the Mary Jane in and Captain Triggs on board. The work of the\r\nshort winter's day was all but over, and Reuben accepted an invitation\r\nto bide where he was and have a bit of a yarn.\r\n\r\n\"You've bin bad, haven't 'ee?\" Captain Triggs said with friendly anxiety\r\nas, seated in the little cabin, their faces were brought on a level of\r\nnear inspection.\r\n\r\n\"Me--bad?\" replied Reuben. \"No. Why, what made you think of that?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Cos you'm lookin' so gashly about the gills.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I was always a hatchet-faced fellow,\" said Reuben, wondering as he\r\nspoke whether his lack of personal appearance had in any way damaged his\r\ncause with Eve, for poor Reuben was in that state when thoughts,\r\nactions, words have but one centre round which they all seem unavoidably\r\nto revolve.\r\n\r\n\"But you'm wuss than ever now. I reckon,\" continued Captain Triggs,\r\n\"'tis through addlin' your head over them clocks and watches too close,\r\neh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, perhaps so,\" said Reuben. \"I often think that if I could I should\r\nlike to be more in the open air.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come for a voyage with me, then,\" said Triggs heartily. \"I'll take 'ee,\r\nand give'ee a shake-down free; and yer mate and drink for the aitin'.\r\nCome, you can't have fairer than that said, now, can 'ee?\"\r\n\r\nA wild thought rushed into Reuben's mind. Should he go with him, see Eve\r\nonce more, and try whether it was possible to move her to some other\r\ndecision? \"You're very kind, I'm sure,\" he began, \"and I feel very much\r\nobliged for such an offer; but--\"\r\n\r\n\"There! 'tis nothin' to be obliged for,\" interrupted Triggs, thinking it\r\nwas Reuben's modesty made him hesitate. \"We'm a hand short, so anywise\r\nthere's a berth empty; and as for the vittals, they allays cooks a sight\r\nmore than us can get the rids of. So I'm only offerin' 'ee what us can't\r\nate ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you mean what you're saying,\" said Reuben--\"at least,\" he\r\nadded, smiling, \"I hope you do, for 'pon my word I feel as if I should\r\nlike very much to go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Iss, sure, Come along, then. Us sha'n't start afore next week, and\r\nyou'll be to Bristol and back 'fore they've had time to miss 'ee here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bristol?\" ejaculated Reuben. \"I thought you were going to Cornwall\r\nagain?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not to wance, I ain't, but wouldn't 'ee rather go to Bristol? 'Tis a\r\nbrave place, you know. For my part, I'd so soon see Bristol as London:\r\n'tis pretty much o' the same lookout here as there.\" But while Captain\r\nTriggs had been saying these words his thoughts had made a sudden leap\r\ntoward the truth, and, finding Reuben not ready with a remark, he\r\ncontinued: \"'Tain't on no account of the young female you comed aboard\r\nhere with that's makin' 'ee think o' Cornwall, is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is,\" said Reuben bluntly. \"I want to see her. I've had a letter\r\nfrom her, and it needs a little talkin' over.\"\r\n\r\n\"Awh! then I 'spects there's no need for me to tell 'ee that her's took\r\nup with Adam Pascal. You knaws it already?\"\r\n\r\nReuben felt as if a pike had been driven into his heart, but his\r\nself-command stood him in good stead, and he said quite steadily, \"Do\r\nyou happen to know him or anything about him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Awh, iss: I knaws 'en fast enuf,\" said Triggs, who felt by intuition\r\nthat Reuben's desire was to know no good of him, \"and a precious\r\nstomachy chap he is. Lord! I pities the maid who'll be his missis:\r\nwhether gentle or simple, her's got her work cut out afore her.\"\r\n\r\n\"In what way? How do ye mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, he's got the temper o' the old un to stand up agen, and wherever\r\nhe shows his face he must be head and chief and must lay down the law,\r\nand you must hearken to act by it or else look out for squalls.\"\r\n\r\nReuben drew his breath more freely. \"And what is he?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Wa-all, I reckon he's her cousin, you knaw,\" answered Triggs,\r\nmisinterpreting the question, \"'cos he's ole Zebedee's awnly son, and\r\nthe ole chap's got houses and lands and I dunno what all. But, there! I\r\nwouldn't change with 'em; for you knaw what they be, all alike--a\r\ndrunk-in', fightin', cussin' lot. Lor's! I cudn't stand it, I cudn't, to\r\nbe drunk from mornin' to night and from night to mornin'.\"\r\n\r\n\"And is he one of this sort?\" exclaimed Reuben in horror. \"Why, are her\r\nrelations like that?\"\r\n\r\n\"They'm all tarred with the wan brush, I reckon,\" replied Triggs. \"If\r\nnot, they cudn't keep things goin' as they do: 'tis the drink car'ies\r\n'em through with it. Why, I knaws by the little I've a done that ways\r\nmyself how 'tis. Git a good skinful o' grog in 'ee, and wan man feels\r\nhe's five, and, so long as it lasts, he's got the sperrit and 'ull do\r\nthe work o' five too: then when 'tis beginnin' to drop a bit, in with\r\nmore liquor, and so go on till the job's over.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how long do they keep it up?\" said Reuben.\r\n\r\n\"Wa-all, that's more than I can answer for. Let me see,\" said Triggs,\r\nreflectively. \"There was ole Zeke Spry: he was up eighty-seben, and he\r\nused to say he'd never, that he knowed by and could help, bin to bed not\r\nto say _sober_ since he'd comed to years o' discretion. But in that ways\r\nhe was only wan o' many; and after he was dead 't happened just as 't\r\nole chap had said it wud, for he used to say, 'When I'm tooked folks\r\n'ull get up a talk that ole Zeke Spry killed hisself with drink; but\r\ndon't you listen to it,' he says, ''cos 'tain't nothin' o' the sort: he\r\ndied for want o' breath--that's what killed he;' and I reckon he was\r\nabout right, else there wudn't be nobody left to die in Polperro.\"\r\n\r\n\"Polperro?\" said Reuben: \"that's where your ship goes to?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not ezactly: I goes to Fowey, but they bain't over a step or so\r\napart--a matter o' six miles, say.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, which Captain Triggs broke by saying, \"Iss, I thought\r\nwhether it wudn't surprise 'ee to hear 'bout it bein' Adam Pascal.\r\nThey'm none of 'em overmuch took with it, I reckon, for they allays\r\ncounted on 'im havin' Joan Hocken: her's another cousin, and another\r\nnice handful, by all that's told up.\"\r\n\r\nReuben's spirit groaned within him. \"Oh, if I'd only known of this\r\nbefore!\" he said. \"I'd have kept her by force from going, or if she\r\nwould have gone I'd have gone with her. She was brought up so\r\ndifferently!\" he continued, addressing Triggs. \"A more respectable woman\r\nnever lived than her mother was.\"\r\n\r\n\"Awh! so the Pascals all be: there's none of 'em but what's respectable\r\nand well-to-do. What I've bin tellin' of 'ee is their ways, you knaw:\r\n'tain't nothing agen 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's quite decided me to go down and see her, though,\" said Reuben. \"I\r\nfeel it's what her mother would have me do: she in a way asked me to act\r\na brother's part to her when she was dying, for she didn't dream about\r\nher having anything to do with these relations whom she's got among\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wa-all, 'twas a thousand pities you let her go, then,\" said Triggs;\r\n\"and, though I'm not wantin' to hinder 'ee--for you'm so welcome to a\r\npassage down to Fowey as you be round to Bristol--still, don't it strike\r\n'ee that if her wudn't stay here for yer axin' then, her ain't likely to\r\nbudge from there for your axin' now?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can but try, though,\" said Reuben, \"and if you let me go when you're\r\ngoing--\"\r\n\r\n\"Say no more, and the thing's settled,\" replied Triggs decisively. \"I\r\nshall come back to London with a return cargo, which 'ull have to be\r\ndelivered: another wan 'ull be tooked in, and, that aboard, off us\r\ngoes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then the bargain's made,\" said Reuben, holding out his hand; \"and\r\nwhenever you're ready to start you'll find me ready to go.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Triggs gave the hand a hearty shake in token of his willingness\r\nto perform his share of the compact; and the matter being so far\r\nsettled, Reuben made his necessary preparations, and with all the\r\npatience he could summon to his aid endeavored to wait with calmness the\r\ndate of departure.\r\n\r\nWhile Reuben was waiting in London activity had begun to stir again in\r\nPolperro. The season of pleasure was over: the men had grown weary of\r\nidleness and merrymaking, and most of them now anxiously awaited the\r\nfresh trip on which they were about to start. The first run after March\r\nwas always an important one, and the leaders of the various crews had\r\nbeen at some trouble to arrange this point to the general satisfaction.\r\n\r\nAdam's temper had been sorely tried during these discussions, but never\r\nhad he so well governed it nor kept his sharp speech under such good\r\ncontrol; the reason being that at length he had found another outlet for\r\nhis wounded sensibility.\r\n\r\nWith the knowledge that the heart he most cared for applauded and\r\nsympathized with his hopes and his failures Adam could be silent and be\r\ncalm. To Jerrem alone the cause of this alteration was apparent, and\r\nwith all the lynx-eyed sharpness of vexed and wounded vanity he tried to\r\nthwart and irritate Adam by sneering remarks and covert suggestions that\r\nall must now give way to him: it was nothing but \"follow my leader\" and\r\ndo and say what he chose--words which were as pitch upon tow to natures\r\nso readily inflamed, so headstrong against government and impatient of\r\neverything which savored of control. And the further misfortune of this\r\nwas that Adam, though detecting Jerrem's influence in all this\r\nopposition, was unable to speak of it to Eve. It was the single point\r\nrelating to the whole matter on which the two kept silent, each\r\nregarding the very mention of Jerrem's name as a firebrand which might\r\nperchance destroy the wonderful harmony which for the last week or so\r\nhad reigned between them, and which to both was so sweet that neither\r\nhad the courage to endanger or destroy it.\r\n\r\nAt length the day of departure had come, and as each hour brought the\r\ninevitable separation closer Eve's heart began to discover itself more\r\nopenly, and she no longer disguised or hid from those around that her\r\nlove, her hopes, her fears were centred upon Adam.\r\n\r\nIn vain did Jerrem try, by the most despairing looks and despondent\r\nsighs, to attract her attention and entice her to an interview. Away\r\nfrom Adam's side--or, Adam absent, from Joan's company--Eve would not\r\nstir, until Jerrem, driven into downright ill-humor, was forced to take\r\nrefuge in sullen silence.\r\n\r\nIt had been decided that the Lottery was to start in the evening, and\r\nthe day had been a busy one, but toward the end of the afternoon Adam\r\nmanaged to spare a little time, which was to be devoted to Eve and to\r\nsaying the farewell which in reality was then to take place between\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn order to ensure a certain amount of privacy, it had been arranged\r\nthat Eve should go to an opening some halfway up Talland lane and there\r\nawait Adam's approach, which he would make by scrambling up from under\r\nthe cliff and so across to where she could see and come to meet him.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, as soon as five o'clock had struck, Eve, who had been\r\nfidgeting about for some time, got up and said, \"Joan, if Jerrem comes\r\nin you won't tell where I've gone, will you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, seein' I don't knaw the where-abouts of it myself, I should be\r\npuzzled,\" said Joan.\r\n\r\n\"I'm goin' up Talland lane to meet Adam,\" faltered Eve; \"and as it's to\r\nsay good-bye, I--we--don't want anybody else, you see.\"\r\n\r\nThe tremulous tone of the last few words made Joan turn round, and,\r\nlooking at Eve, she saw that the gathered tears were ready to fall from\r\nher eyes. Joan had felt a desire to be sharp in speech, but the sight of\r\nEve's face melted her anger at once, and with a sudden change of manner\r\nshe said, \"Why, bless the maid! what's there to cry about? You'm a nice\r\none, I just say, to be a sailor's wife! Lor's! don't let 'em see that\r\nyou frets to see their backs, or they'll be gettin' it into their heads\r\nnext that they'm somebodys and we can't live without 'em. They'll come\r\nback soon enough, and a sight too soon for a good many here, I can tell\r\n'ee.\"\r\n\r\nEve shook her head. \"But will they come back?\" she said despairingly.\r\n\"I feel something different to what I ever felt before--a presentiment\r\nof evil, as if something would happen. What could happen to them, Joan?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lord bless 'ee! don't ax un what could happen to 'em. Why, a hunderd\r\nthings: they could be wracked and drowned, or catched and killed, or\r\ntooked and hung.\" Then, bursting into a laugh at Eve's face of horror,\r\nshe exclaimed, \"Pack o' stuff, nonsense! Don't 'ee take heed o' no\r\nfancies nor rubbish o' that sort. They'll come back safe enuf, as\r\nthey've allays done afore. Nothin's ever happened to 'em yet: what\r\nshould make it now? T' world ain't a-comin' to an end 'cos you'm come\r\ndown fra' London town. There, get along with 'ee, do!\" and she pushed\r\nher gently toward the door, adding, with a sigh, \"'Twould be a poor tale\r\nif Adam was never to come back now, and it the first time he ever left\r\nbehind un anything he cared to see agen.\"\r\n\r\nEve soon reached her point of observation, and under shelter of the\r\nhedge she stood looking with anxious eyes in the direction from which\r\nAdam was to come. It had been a clear bright day, and the air blew fresh\r\nand cool; the sky (except to windward, where a few white fleecy masses\r\nlay scattered about) was cloudless; the sea was of a deep-indigo blue,\r\nflecked with ridges of foam, which unfurled and spread along each wave,\r\ncrested its tip and rode triumphant to the shore. Inside the Peak, over\r\nthe harbor, the gulls were congregated, some fluttering over the water,\r\nsome riding on its surface, some flying in circles over the heights, now\r\ngreen and soft with the thick fresh grass of spring. Down the spine of\r\nthe cliff the tangle of brier-wood and brambles, though not leafless,\r\nstill showed brown, and the long trails which were lifted and bowed down\r\nas the sudden gusts of wind swept over them, looked bare and wintry.\r\n\r\nEve gave an involuntary shiver, and her eyes, so quick to drink in each\r\nvaried aspect of the sea, now seemed to try and shut out its beauty from\r\nbefore her.\r\n\r\nWhat should she do if the wind blew and the waves rose as she had seen\r\nthem do of late, rejoicing in the sight, with Adam by her side? But\r\nwith him away, she here alone--oh, her spirit sank within her; and to\r\ndrive away the thoughts which came crowding into her mind she left her\r\nshelter, and, hurrying along the little path, crossed the cress-grown\r\nbrook, and was soon halfway up the craggy ascent, when Adam, who had\r\nreached the top from the other side, called out, \"Hallo! I didn't think\r\nto find you here. We'd best walk back a bit, or else we shall be just in\r\nthe eye of the wind, and it's coming on rather fresh.\"\r\n\r\n\"You won't go if it blows, Adam?\" and Eve's face betrayed her anxiety.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my dear one,\" he said kindly, \"you mustn't think of the wind's\r\nhaving anything to do with me. Besides, it's all in our favor, you know:\r\nit'll rock us to sleep all the sooner.\"\r\n\r\nEve tried to smile back as she looked up at him, but it was a very\r\nfeeble attempt. \"I don't want to feel frightened,\" she said, \"but I\r\ncan't help it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't help what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, thinking that something may happen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, nonsense!\" he said: \"there's nothing going to happen. It's because\r\nyou care for me you think like that. Why, look at me: ain't I the same?\r\nBefore this I never felt anything but glad to be off and get away; but\r\nthis time\"--and he drew a long sigh, as if to get rid of the\r\noppression--\"I seem to carry about a lump of lead inside me, and the\r\nnearer it comes to saying good-bye the heavier it grows.\"\r\n\r\nThis sympathy seemed to afford Eve some consolation, and when she spoke\r\nagain it was to ask in a more cheerful tone how long their probable\r\nabsence would be, where they were going, what time they would take in\r\ngetting there; to all of which Adam answered with unnecessary exactness,\r\nfor both of them felt they were talking, for talking's sake, of things\r\nabout which they knew all they could know already. Yet how was it\r\npossible, in the light of open day, when at any moment they might be\r\njoined by a third person, to speak of that which lay deep down in their\r\nhearts, waiting only for a word, a caress, a tender look, to give it\r\nvoice?\r\n\r\nAdam had had a dozen cautions, entreaties, injunctions to give to Eve:\r\nhe had been counting through every minute of the day the time to this\r\nhour, and now it had come and he seemed to have nothing to say--could\r\nthink of nothing except how long he could possibly give to remaining.\r\n\r\n\"By Jove!\" he exclaimed after more than an hour had slipped away--time\r\nwasted in irrelevant questions and answers, with long pauses between,\r\nwhen neither could think of anything to say, and each wondered why the\r\nother did not speak--\"By Jove, Eve! I must be off: I didn't think the\r\ntime had gone so quick. We mustn't start at the furthest later than\r\neight; and if I ain't there to look after them nobody'll think it worth\r\nwhile to be ready.\"\r\n\r\nThey were back under shelter of the hedge again now, and Adam (who\r\npossessed the singular quality of not caring to do his lovemaking in\r\npublic) ventured to put his arm round Eve's waist and draw her toward\r\nhim. \"You'll never let me go again,\" he said, \"without bein' able to\r\nleave you my wife, Eve, will you? 'Tis that, I b'lieve, is pressing on\r\nme. I wish now more than ever that you hadn't persisted in saying no all\r\nthis long winter.\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't say no next time,\" she said, while the hitherto restrained\r\ntears began to fall thick and fast.\r\n\r\nAdam's delight was not spoken in words, and for the time he forgot all\r\nabout the possibility of being overlooked: \"Then, when I come back I\r\nsha'n't be kept waiting any longer?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we shall be married at once?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nAdam strained her again to his heart. \"Then, come what may,\" he said, \"I\r\nsha'n't fear it. So long as I've got you, Eve, I don't care what\r\nhappens. It's no good,\" he said, after another pause. \"The time's up,\r\nand I must be off. Cheer up, my girl, cheer up! Look up at me, Eve,\r\nthat's a sweetheart! Now, one kiss more, and after that we must go on to\r\nthe gate, and then good-bye indeed.\"\r\n\r\nBut, the gate reached and the good-bye said, Eve still lingered. \"Oh,\r\nAdam!\" she cried, \"stop--wait for one instant.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Adam, well pleased to be detained, turned toward her once more.\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye, Adam: God watch over you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Amen, my girl, amen! May He watch over both of us, for before Him we\r\nare one now, Eve: we've taken each other, as the book has it, for\r\nbetter, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health.\"\r\n\r\n\"Till death do you part,\" said the sepulchral tones of a voice behind\r\nthe hedge; and with a laugh at the start he had given them Jerrem passed\r\nby the gate and went on his way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral weeks had now passed by since the bustle of departure was over,\r\nand, though no direct intelligence had come from the absentees, a rumor\r\nhad somehow spread abroad that the expected run of goods was to be one\r\nof the largest ever made in Polperro.\r\n\r\nThe probability of this fact had been known to the leaders of the\r\nexpedition before they started, and had afforded Adam another\r\nopportunity for impressing upon them the great necessity for increased\r\ncaution.\r\n\r\nGrown suspicious at the supineness which generally pervaded the revenue\r\ndepartment, the government had decided upon a complete revolution, and\r\nduring the winter months the entire force of the coast had been\r\neverywhere superseded and in many places increased. Both at Looe and\r\nFowey the cutters had new officers and crews, and the men, inflamed with\r\nthe zeal of newcomers, were most ardent to make a capture and so prove\r\nthemselves worthy of the post assigned to them.\r\n\r\nWhile all his comrades had affected to laugh at these movements, Adam\r\nhad viewed them with anxiety--had seen the graveness of their import and\r\nthe disasters likely to arise from them; and at length his arguments had\r\nso far prevailed that a little better regulation was made for the\r\nworking of signals and ensuring that they should be given and attended\r\nto if required. In case of danger the rule was to burn a fire on\r\ndifferent heights of the cliff, and small huts were even erected for\r\nthat purpose; but the lighting of these fires was often delayed until\r\nthe last moment: what had become everybody's business was nobody's\r\nbusiness, and secure that, in any case, the cruisers were no more\r\nwilling to fight than the smugglers were wanting to be fought, hazards\r\nwere often incurred which with men whose silence could not be bought\r\n(for up to that time every crew had had its go-between) would most\r\ncertainly have proved fatal.\r\n\r\nUpon the present force no influence could as yet be got to bear, and, to\r\nprove the temper of their dispositions, no sooner was it known to them\r\nthat three of the most daring of the Polperro vessels were absent than\r\nthey set to watching the place with such untiring vigilance that it\r\nneeded all the sharpness of those left behind to follow their movements\r\nand arrange the signals so that they might warn their friends without\r\nexciting undue suspicions among their enemies.\r\n\r\nNight after night, in one place or another, the sheltered flicker of the\r\nflame shone forth as a warning that any attempt to land would prove\r\ndangerous, until, word being suddenly brought that the cruiser had gone\r\noff to Polruan, out went the fire, and, an answering light showing that\r\nat least one of the vessels was on the watch, when the morning dawned\r\nthe Stamp and Go was in and her cargo safe under water. The Lottery, she\r\nsaid, had contrived to decoy the revenue-men away, hoping that by that\r\nmeans the two smaller vessels might stand a chance of running in, but\r\nfrom their having to part company and keep well away from each other,\r\nthe Stamp and Go, though certain the Cleopatra was not far off, had lost\r\nsight of her.\r\n\r\nThe day passed away, the evening light had all but faded, when to the\r\nwatchers the Cleopatra, with crowded sail and aided by a south-west\r\nwind, was seen trying to make the harbor, close followed by the\r\ncruiser. The news flew over the place like lightning, and but a few\r\nminutes seemed to have passed before all Polperro swarmed the cliffs,\r\neach trying to secure a vantage-point by putting forth some strong claim\r\nof interest in those on board. With trembling hearts and anxious gaze\r\nthe lookers-on watched each movement of the two vessels, a dead silence\r\nprevailing among them so long as they both followed in the same course,\r\nbut the instant a clever tack was made by which the pursuers were\r\nbaffled, up rose the shout of many voices, and cries were heard and\r\nprayers uttered that the darkness would come quickly on and afford their\r\nfriends a safe entrance.\r\n\r\nExcept to such men as steered the Cleopatra, to enter Polperro harbor\r\namid darkness and wind was a task beyond their skill; and, knowing this,\r\nand seeing by her adversary's tactics the near possibility of defeat,\r\nthe cruiser had resort to her guns, trying to cut away the Cleopatra's\r\ngear, and by that means compel her to heave-to. But, though partly\r\ndisabled, the stout little vessel bore onward, and night's friendly\r\nclouds coming to her aid, the discomfited cruiser had to withdraw within\r\nhearing of the triumphant shouts which welcomed her rival's safety.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the Lottery all was now safe, but no fears were\r\nentertained on her account, because, from her superior size and her\r\nwell-known fast-sailing qualities, the risks which had endangered the\r\nother two vessels would in no way affect her. She had merely to cruise\r\noutside and await, with all the patience her crew could command, a\r\nfitting opportunity for slipping in, escaping the revenue-men and\r\nturning on them a fresh downpour of taunts and ridicule.\r\n\r\nIn proof of this, several of the neighboring fishing-boats had from time\r\nto time seen and spoken to the Lottery; and with a view to render those\r\nat home perfectly at ease every now and again one of these trusty\r\nmessengers would arrive with a few words which would be speedily\r\ncirculated among those most interested. The fact of her absence, and the\r\nknowledge that at any time the attempt to land might be made, naturally\r\nkept every one on the strain; and directly night set in both Joan and\r\nEve trembled at each movement and started at every sound.\r\n\r\nOne night, as, in case of surprise, they were setting all things in\r\norder, a sudden shuffling made Joan fly to the door. \"Why, Jonathan,\"\r\nshe exclaimed, admitting the man whom Eve had never seen since the\r\nevening after her arrival, \"what's up? What brings you here, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've comed with summat for you,\" he said, casting a suspicious look at\r\nEve.\r\n\r\n\"Well, out with it, then,\" said Joan, quickly adding, as she jerked her\r\nhead in that direction, \"us don't have no secrets from she.\"\r\n\r\n\"Awh, doant 'ee?\" returned Jonathan in a voice which sounded the reverse\r\nof complimentary. \"Wa-all, then, there's what 'tis;\" and he held toward\r\nher a piece of paper folded up like a letter.\r\n\r\n\"Who's it from? where did 'ee get un?\" asked Joan, while Eve exclaimed,\r\n\"Oh, Joan, see is it from them?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't stay no longer,\" said Jonathan, preparing to retreat.\r\n\r\n\"But you must stay till we've made out what this here is,\" said Joan.\r\n\r\nJonathan shook his head. \"'Tain't nothin' to do with what I'm about,\" he\r\nanswered, determined not to be detained, \"and I've got to run all the\r\nfaster 'cos I've comed round this way to bring it. But Jerrem gived it\r\nto me,\" he whispered, \"and Adam ain't to be tould nothin' of it;\" and he\r\nadded a few more words which made Joan release her hold of him and seem\r\nas anxious to see him gone as he was to go.\r\n\r\nThe first part of the whisper had reached Eve's ears, and the hope which\r\nhad leaped into her heart had been forced back by the disappointment\r\nthat Jerrem, not Adam, had sent the letter. Still, it might contain some\r\nnews of their return, and she turned to Joan with a look of impatient\r\ninquiry.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder whatever 'tis about?\" said Joan, claiming the right of\r\nownership so far as the unfolding the missive went. \"Some random talk\r\nor 'nother, I'll be bound,\" she added, with a keener knowledge of her\r\ncorrespondent than Eve possessed. \"I'll warrant he's a nice handful\r\naboard there 'mongst 'em all, with nothin' to do but drinkin' and\r\ndice-throwin' from mornin' to night. Awh, laws!\" she said, with a sigh\r\nof discontent as the written page lay open before her, \"what's the good\r\no' sendin' a passel o' writin' like that to me? 'T might so well be\r\ndouble Dutch for aught I can make out o' any o' it. There! take and read\r\nit, do 'ee, Eve, and let's hear what he says--a good deal more 'bout you\r\nthan me, I'll lay a wager to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I don't know why he should,\" said Eve.\r\n\r\n\"No, nor I neither,\" laughed Joan; \"but, there! I ain't jealous o' he,\r\nfor, as I'm Jerrem's cut-and-come-agen, his makin' up to other maidens\r\nonly leaves un more relish for comin' back to the dish he can stick by.\"\r\n\r\nEve's eyes had by this time run over the carelessly-written, sprawling\r\npage of the letter, and her face flushed up crimson as she said, \"I\r\nreally do wish Jerrem would give over all this silly nonsense. He has no\r\nbusiness to write in this way to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"To you?\" exclaimed Joan, snatching back the letter to look at the\r\noutside. \"Why, that ain't to you;\" and she laid her finger on the\r\ndirection. \"Come now, 'tis true I bain't much of a scholard, but I'm\r\nblessed if I can't swear to my awn name when I sees un.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's only the outside,\" said Eve: \"all the rest is to me--nothing but\r\na parcel of silly questions, asking me how he has offended me, and why I\r\ndon't treat him as I used to; as if he didn't know that he has nobody\r\nbut himself to blame for the difference!\"\r\n\r\n\"And ain't there nothin' else? Don't he send no word to me?\" asked Joan\r\nruefully.\r\n\r\nEve, who was only too glad that poor Joan's ignorance prevented her\r\nreading the exaggerated rhodomontade of penitence and despair with which\r\nthe paper was filled, ignored the first question. \"He says,\" she said,\r\nturning to read from the page, \"'As you won't give me the opportunity\r\nof speaking to you, promise me that when we meet, which will be\r\nto-morrow night--' Oh, Joan, can that be true? do you think he means\r\nreally to-morrow?\" then, running her eyes farther on, she continued:\r\n\"Perhaps he does, for--listen, Joan--'You mustn't split on me to Adam,\r\nwho's cock-a-hoop about giving you all a surprise, and there'd be the\r\ndevil to pay if he found out I'd blown the gaff.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, ain't that Jerrem all over?\" exclaimed Joan angrily, anything but\r\npleased at the neglect she had suffered--\"just flyin' in the face o'\r\neverything Adam wants done. He knaws how things has got abroad afore,\r\nnobody could tell how, and yet, 'cos he's axed, he can't keep a quiet\r\ntongue in his head.\"\r\n\r\n\"I tell you what we'll do,\" said Eve--\"not take a bit of notice of the\r\nletter, Joan, and just act as if we'd never had it: shall we?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I reckon 'twould be the best way, for I shouldn't wonder but they\r\nbe comin',\" she added, while Eve, anxious to be rid of the letter,\r\nhastily flung it into the fire and stood watching it blaze up and die\r\nout. \"Jonathan gave a hint o' somethin',\" continued Joan, \"though he\r\nnever named no time, which, if he was trusted with, he knaws better than\r\nto tell of.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder they do trust him, though,\" said Eve, \"seeing he's rather\r\nsilly?\"\r\n\r\n\"Awh! most o' his _silly_ is to serve his own turn. Why, to see un\r\nelsewheres you'd say he'd stored up his wits to Polperro, and left 'em\r\nhere till he gets back agen; and that's how 'tis he ferrets out the\r\nthings he does, 'cos nobody minds un nor pays no heed to un; and if he\r\ndoes by chance come creepin' up or stand anigh, ''Tis only poor foolish\r\nJonathan,' they says.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sun which came streaming in through the windows next morning seemed\r\nthe herald of coming joy. Eve was the first to be awakened, and she soon\r\naroused Joan. \"It won't make no difference to them because the day's\r\nfine,\" she asked: \"will it, Joan?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit: they don't care a dump what the day is, so long as the\r\nnight's only dark enough; and there'll be no show o' moon this week.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm so glad!\" said Eve, breaking out into a snatch of an old song\r\nwhich had caught her fancy.\r\n\r\n\"Awh, my dear, don't 'ee begin to sing, not till breakfast is over,\"\r\nexclaimed Joan. \"'Sing afore you bite, cry afore night.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Cry with joy perhaps,\" laughed Eve; still, she hushed her melody and\r\nhastened her speed to get quickly dressed and her breakfast over. That\r\ndone with, the house had to be fresh put in order, while Joan applied\r\nherself to the making of various pies and pastries; \"For, you see,\" she\r\nsaid, \"if they won't all of 'em be just ready for a jollification this\r\ntime, and no mistake!\"\r\n\r\n\"And I'm sure they deserve to have one,\" said Eve, whose ideas of\r\nmerrymaking were on a much broader scale now than formerly. It was true\r\nshe still always avoided the sight of a drunken man and ran away from a\r\nfight, but this was more because her feelings were outraged at these\r\nsights than because her sense of right and wrong was any longer shocked\r\nat the vices which led to them.\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell 'ee what I think I'll do,\" said Joan as, her culinary tasks\r\nover, she felt at liberty to indulge in some relaxation: \"I'll just run\r\nin to Polly Taprail's and two or three places near, and see if the\r\nwind's blowed them any of this news.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, do,\" said Eve, \"and I shall go along by the Warren a little way\r\nand look at the sea, and that--\"\r\n\r\n\"Lord save the maid!\" laughed Joan: \"whatever you finds in the say to\r\nlook at I can't tell. I knaw 'tis there, but I niver wants to turn my\r\neyes that way, 'ceptin' 'tis to look at somethin' 'pon it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait till you've been in a town like I have for some time,\" said Eve.\r\n\r\n\"Wait? Iss, I 'spects 'twill be wait 'fore my turn comes to be in a town\r\nfor long. Awh, but I should just like to go to London, though,\" she\r\nadded: \"wouldn't I just come back ginteel!\" and she walked out of the\r\ndoor with the imaginary strut such an importance would warrant her in\r\nassuming. Eve followed, and the two walked together down Lansallos\r\nstreet, at the corner of which they parted--Joan to go to Mrs.\r\nTaprail's, and Eve along by the Warren toward Talland, for, although she\r\nhad not told her intention to Joan, she had made up her mind to walk on\r\nto where she could get sight of Talland Bay.\r\n\r\nShe was just in that state of hope and fear when inaction becomes\r\npositive pain, and relief is only felt while in pursuit of an object\r\nwhich entails some degree of bodily movement. Joan had so laughed at her\r\nfears for the Lottery that to a great extent her anxiety had subsided;\r\nand everybody else seemed so certain that with Adam's caution and\r\nforesight nothing could possibly happen to them that to doubt their\r\nsafety seemed to doubt his wisdom.\r\n\r\nDuring this last voyage Adam had had a considerable rise in the opinions\r\nof the Polperro folk: they would not admit it too openly, but in\r\ndiscussions between twos and threes it was acknowledged that \"Adam had\r\ntook the measure o' they new revenoo-chaps from the fust, and said they\r\nwas a cunnin', desateful lot, and not to be dealt with no ways;\" and\r\nEve, knowing the opposition he had had to undergo, felt a just pride\r\nthat they were forced into seeing that his fears had some ground and\r\nthat his advice was worth following out.\r\n\r\nOnce past the houses, she determined no longer to linger, but walk on as\r\nbriskly as possible; and this was the more advisable because the day was\r\na true April one: sharp showers of mingled hail and rain had succeeded\r\nthe sun, which now again was shining out with dazzling brightness.\r\n\r\nThe sea was green and rippled over with short dancing waves, across\r\nwhich ran long slanting shadows of a bright violet hue, reflected from\r\nthe sun and sky; but by the time Eve reached a jutting stone which\r\nserved as a landmark all this was vanishing, and, turning, she saw\r\ncoming up a swift creeping shadow which drew behind it a misty veil that\r\ncovered up both sea and sky and blotted them from view.\r\n\r\n\"Oh my! here's another hailstorm coming,\" she said; and, drawing the\r\nhood of her cloak close over her face, she made all haste down the steep\r\nbit of irregular rock toward where she knew that, a little way off the\r\npath, a huge boulder would afford her shelter.\r\n\r\nDown came the rain, and with it such a gust of wind that, stumbling up\r\nthe bit of cliff on which the stone stood, Eve was almost bent double.\r\nHullo! Somebody was here already, and, shaking back her hood to see who\r\nher companion in distress might be, she uttered a sharp scream of\r\nhorror, for the man who stood before her was no other than Reuben May.\r\n\r\n\"Then you're not glad to see me, Eve?\" he said, for the movement Eve had\r\ninvoluntarily made was to put out her hands as if to push him away.\r\n\r\nEve tried to speak, but the sudden fright of his unexpected presence\r\nseemed to have dried up her throat and tongue and taken away all power\r\nof utterance.\r\n\r\n\"Your old chum, Capen Triggs, asked me how I should like to take a bit\r\nof a trip with him, and I thought, as I hadn't much to keep me, I'd take\r\nhis offer; and, as he's stopped at Plymouth for a day or so, I made up\r\nmy mind to come so far as here and see for myself if some of what I've\r\nbeen told is true.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, what have you been told?\" said Eve, catching at anything which\r\nmight spare her some of the unpleasantness of a first communication.\r\n\r\n\"Well, for one thing, that you're going to be married to your cousin.\"\r\n\r\nEve's color rose, and Reuben, thinking it might be anger, said, \"Don't\r\nmake any mistake, Eve: I haven't come to speak about myself. All that's\r\npast and over, and God only knows why I ever got such folly into my\r\nhead;\" and Reuben thought himself perfectly sincere in making this\r\nstatement, for he had talked himself into the belief that this journey\r\nwas undertaken from the sole desire to carry out his trust. \"What I've\r\ncome to do is to speak to you like a friend, and ask you to tell me what\r\nsort of people these are that you're among, and how the man gets his\r\nliving that you're thinking of being married to.\"\r\n\r\nEve hesitated: then she said, \"There is no need for me to answer you,\r\nReuben, because I can see that somebody already has been talking about\r\nthem to you--haven't they?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, they have, but how do I know that what they've said is true?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I dare say it's true enough,\" she said: \"people ain't likely to\r\ntell you false about a thing nobody here feels ashamed to own to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not ashamed of being drunkards, law-breakers, thieves?\" said Reuben\r\nsternly.\r\n\r\n\"Reuben May,\" exclaimed Eve, flaming up with indignation and entirely\r\nforgetting that but a little time before she had held an exactly similar\r\nopinion, \"do you forget that you're speaking of my own father's\r\nblood-relations--people who're called by the same name I am?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't forget it, Eve; and I don't forget, neither, that if I\r\ndidn't think that down here you would soon become ruined, body and soul,\r\nI'd rather cut my tongue out than it should give utterance to a word\r\nthat could cause you pain. You speak of your father, but think of your\r\nmother, Eve--think if she could rise up before you could you ask her\r\nblessing on what you're going to do?\"\r\n\r\nEve's face quivered with emotion, and Reuben, seizing his advantage,\r\ncontinued: \"Perhaps you think I'm saying this because I'm wanting you\r\nfor myself, but, as God will judge us, 'tisn't that that's making me\r\nspeak, Eve;\" and he held out his hand toward her. \"You've known me for\r\nmany a long year now--my heart's been laid more bare to you than to any\r\nliving creature: do you believe what I'm saying to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Reuben, I do,\" she answered firmly, though the tears, no longer\r\nrestrained, came streaming from her eyes; \"and you must also believe\r\nwhat I say to you--that my cousin is a man as honest and upright as\r\nyourself, that he wouldn't defraud any one of the value of a pin's\r\npoint, nor take a thing that he didn't think himself he'd got a proper\r\nright to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good God, Eve! is it possible that you can speak like this of one who\r\ngets his living by smuggling?\" and a spasm of positive agony passed\r\nover Reuben's face as he tried to realize the change of thought and\r\nfeeling which could induce a calm defence of such iniquity. \"What's the\r\ndifference whether a man robs me or he robs the king? Isn't he stealing\r\njust the same?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, certainly not,\" said Eve, quickly. \"I can't explain it all to you,\r\nbut I know this--that what they bring over they buy and pay for, and\r\ncertainly, therefore, have some right to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have a right to?\" repeated Reuben. \"Well, that's good! So men have a\r\nright to smuggle, have they? and smuggling isn't stealing? Come! I\r\nshould just like this cousin of yours to give me half an hour of his\r\ncompany to argue out that matter in.\"\r\n\r\n\"My cousin isn't at home,\" said Eve, filled with a sudden horror of what\r\nmight be expected from an argument between two such tempers as Reuben\r\nand Adam possessed. \"And if you've only come here to argue, whether 'tis\r\nwith me or with them, Reuben, 'tis a waste of time that'll do no good to\r\nyou nor any of us.\"\r\n\r\nReuben did not speak. He stood and for a few moments looked fixedly at\r\nher: then he turned away and hid his face in his hands. The sudden\r\nchange from anger to sorrow came upon Eve unexpectedly: anything like a\r\ndisplay of emotion was so foreign to Reuben that she could not help\r\nbeing affected by it, and after a minute's struggle with herself she\r\nlaid her hand on his arm, saying gently, \"Reuben, don't let me think\r\nyou've come all this long way only to quarrel and say bitter things to\r\nme: let me believe 'tis as you said--because you weren't satisfied, and\r\nfelt, for mother's sake, you wanted to be a friend to me still. I feel\r\nnow as if I ought to have told you when I wrote that I was going to\r\nmarry my cousin Adam, but I didn't do it because I thought you'd write\r\nto me, and then 'twould be easier to speak; and when you didn't take no\r\nnotice I thought you meant to let me go altogether, and I can't tell you\r\nhow hurt I felt. I couldn't help saying to myself over and over again\r\n(though I was so angry with you I didn't know what to do), 'I shall\r\nnever have another such friend as Reuben--never.'\"\r\n\r\nEve's words had their effect, and when Reuben turned his pale face to\r\nher again his whole mood was softened. \"'Tis to be the same friend I\r\nalways was that I've come, Eve,\" he said; \"only you know me, and how I\r\ncan never keep from blurting out all at once things that I ought to\r\nbring round bit by bit, so that they might do good and not give\r\noffence.\"\r\n\r\n\"You haven't offended me yet,\" she said--\"at least,\" she added, smiling\r\nin her old way at him, \"not beyond what I can look over; and so far as I\r\ncan and it will ease your mind, Reuben, I'll try to tell you all you\r\ncare to know about uncle and--the rest of them. I'm sure if you knew\r\nthem you'd like them: you couldn't help it--more particularly Joan and\r\nAdam, if you once saw those two.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why can't I see them, Eve? It wouldn't seem so very strange, being\r\nyour friend--for that's all I claim to be--going there to see you, would\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't know that it would; only,\" and here she hesitated,\r\n\"whatever you saw that you didn't like, Reuben, you'd only speak to me\r\nabout. You wouldn't begin arguing with them, would you?\"\r\n\r\nReuben shook his head. Then with a sudden impulse, he said, \"And have\r\nyou really given all your love to this man, Eve?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she said, not averting her eyes, although her face was covered\r\nwith a quick blush.\r\n\r\n\"And whatever comes you mean to be his wife?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't mean to be anybody else's wife,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"And he--he cares for you?\"\r\n\r\n\"If he didn't be sure I should have never cared for him.\"\r\n\r\nReuben sighed. \"Well,\" he said, \"I'll go and see him. I'll have a talk\r\nwith him, and try and find out what sort of stuff he's made of. If I\r\ncould go away certain that things ain't as bad as I feared to find them,\r\nI should take back a lighter heart with me. You say he isn't home now.\r\nIs he at sea, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not at sea: he's close by.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you expect him back soon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes: we expect him back to-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"To-night? Then I think I'll change my plan. I meant to go back to\r\nPlymouth and see what Triggs is about to do, for I'm going round to\r\nLondon with him when he goes; but if you're expecting your cousin so\r\nsoon, why shouldn't I stop here till I've seen him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but he mightn't come,\" said Eve, who in any case had no wish that\r\nReuben should appear until she had paved the way for his reception, and\r\nabove all things desired his absence on this particular occasion.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I must take my chance of that--unless,\" he added, catching sight\r\nof her face, \"there's any reason against my stopping?\"\r\n\r\nEve colored. \"Well,\" she said, \"perhaps they mightn't care, as they\r\ndon't know you, about your being here. You see,\" she added by way of\r\nexcuse, \"they have been away a long while now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Been to France, I s'pose?\" said Reuben in a tone which conveyed his\r\nsuspicions.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Eve, determined not to seem ashamed of their occupation:\r\n\"I think they've been to Guernsey.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well, all the same, so far as what they went to fetch. Then they're\r\ngoing to _try_ and land their cargo, I s'pose?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what they may be going to _try_ and do\"--and Eve\r\nendeavored to imitate the sneer with which Reuben had emphasized the\r\nword--\"but I know that trying with them means doing. There's nobody\r\nabout here,\" she added with a borrowed spice of Joan's manner, \"would\r\ncare to put themselves in the way of trying to hinder the Lottery.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Tis strange, then, that they shouldn't choose to come in open\r\ndaylight, rather than be sneaking in under cover of a dark night,\" said\r\nReuben aggravatingly.\r\n\r\n\"As it happens,\" retorted Eve, with an assumption of superior nautical\r\nknowledge, \"the dark night suits them best, by reason that at high tide\r\nthey can come in close to Down End. Oh, you needn't try to think you can\r\nhurt me by your sneers at them,\" she said, inwardly smarting under the\r\ncontempt she knew Reuben felt. \"I feel hurt at your wanting to say such\r\nthings, but not at all at what you say. _That_ can't touch me.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, so I see,\" said Reuben hopelessly. Then, after a minute's pause, he\r\nburst out with a passionate, \"Oh, Eve, I feel as if I could take and\r\njump into the sea with you, so as I might feel you'd be safe from the\r\nlife I'm certain you're goin' to be dragged down to. You may think fair\r\nnow of this man, because he's only showed you his fair side; but they\r\nwho know him know him for what he is--bloodthirsty, violent, a drunkard,\r\nnever sober, with his neck in a noose and the gallows swinging over his\r\nhead. What hold will you have over one who fears neither God nor devil?\r\nYes, but I will speak. You shall listen to the truth from me,\" for she\r\nhad tried to interrupt him. \"It isn't too late, and 'tis but fit that\r\nyou know what others say of him.\"\r\n\r\nEve's anger had risen until she seemed turned into a fury, and her\r\nvoice, usually low and full, now sounded hard and sharp as she cried,\r\n\"If they said a hundred times worse of him I would still marry him; and\r\nif he stood on the gallows, that you say swings over his head, I'd stand\r\nby his side and say I was his wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"God pity you!\" groaned Reuben.\r\n\r\n\"I want no pity,\" she said, \"and so you can tell those who would throw\r\nit away on me. Say to them that you sought me out to cast taunts at me,\r\nbut it was of no use, for what you thought I should be ashamed of I\r\ngloried in, and could look you and all the world in the face\"--and she\r\nseemed to grow taller as she spoke--\"and say I felt proud to be a\r\nsmuggler's wife;\" and, turning, she made a movement as if to go.\r\n\r\nBut Reuben took a step so as to impede her. \"Is this to be our parting?\"\r\nhe said. \"Can you throw away the only friend you've got left?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't call you a friend,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"You'll know me for being so one day, though, and bitterly rue you\r\ndidn't pay more heed to my words.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never!\" she said proudly. \"I'd trust Adam with my life: he's true as\r\nsteel. Now,\" she added, stepping on one side, \"I have no more time to\r\nstay: I must go back; so let me pass.\"\r\n\r\nMechanically Reuben moved. Stung by her words, irritated by a sense of\r\nfailure, filled with the sharpest jealousy against his rival, he saw no\r\nother course open to him than to let her go her way and to go his.\r\n\"Good-bye, then, Eve,\" he said, in a dry, cold voice.\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye,\" she answered.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think, after what's passed, you need expect to see me again,\"\r\nhe ventured, with the secret hope that she would pause and say something\r\nthat might lead to a fresh discussion.\r\n\r\n\"I had no notion that you'd still have a thought of coming. I should\r\nlook upon a visit from you as very out of place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well, be sure I sha'n't force myself where I'm not wanted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you'll be wise to stay away, for you'll never be wanted where I\r\nam.\"\r\n\r\nAnd without another glance in his direction she walked away, while\r\nReuben stood and watched her out of sight. \"That's ended,\" he said,\r\nsetting his lips firmly together and hardening the expression of his\r\nnaturally grave face. \"That mad game's finished, and finished so that I\r\nthink I've done with sweet-hearting for as long as I live. Well, thank\r\nGod! a man may get on very fairly though the woman that he made a fool\r\nof himself for flings back his love and turns him over for somebody\r\nelse.\" Then, as if some unseen hand had dealt him a sudden thrust, he\r\ncried out, \"Why did I ever see her? Why was I made to care for her?\r\nHaven't I known the folly of it all along, and fought and strove from\r\nthe first to get the better of myself? and here she comes down and sees\r\na fellow whose eye is tickled by her looks, and he gets in a week what\r\nI've been begging and praying for years for; and they tell you that\r\nGod's ways are just and that He rewards the good and punishes the evil!\"\r\nand Reuben's face worked with suppressed emotion, for in spirit he stood\r\nbefore his Creator and upbraided Him with \"Lo! these many years have I\r\nserved Thee, neither transgressed I at any time Thy commandments; and\r\nyet this drunkard, this evil-liver, this law-breaker, is given that for\r\nwhich in my soul I have thirsted!\" and the devils of envy and revenge\r\nran by his side rejoicing, while Fate flew before and lured him on to\r\nwhere Opportunity stood and welcomed his approach.\r\n\r\n  _The Author of \"Dorothy Fox.\"_\r\n\r\n  [TO BE CONTINUED.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSSESSION.\r\n\r\n\r\n    She is thine own at last, O faithful soul!\r\n      The love that changed not with the changing years\r\n      Hath its reward: Desire's strong prayers and tears\r\n    Fall useless since thy hand hath touched the goal.\r\n    See how she yieldeth up to thy control\r\n      Each mystery of her beauty: enter, thou,\r\n      A vanquished victor.

And yet--and yet--\r\n    What doth it profit thee that every part\r\n    Is thine except the little wayward heart?\r\n\r\n    ELIZA CALVERT HALL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN OLD ENGLISH HOME: BRAMSHILL HOUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA peculiar charm hangs about an Elizabethan country-house.\r\n\r\nThe castles belong to an utterly different state of things and\r\npeople--to a rougher, coarser time. Their towers and walls, where the\r\njackdaws build in the ivy; their moats, where the hoary carp bask and\r\nfatten; their drawbridges and heavy doors and loopholed windows,--these\r\nall tell of the unrest, the semi-war-like state of feudal days, when\r\neach great seigneur was a petty king in his own county, with his private\r\nas well as public feuds, and his little army of men-at-arms ready to do\r\nhis bidding, to sally forth and fight for the king or to defend his own\r\nwalls against some more powerful neighbor.\r\n\r\nThe great houses of the eighteenth century have a different character\r\nagain, with their Italian facades and trim terraced gardens, where the\r\nwits and beauties of dull Queen Anne's time amused themselves after\r\ntheir somewhat rude fashion. They speak of a solid luxury in keeping\r\nwith the heavy features and ponderous minds of the worthies of those\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nBut the Elizabethan, or even early Jacobean, house tells us of England\r\nin her golden age. The walls of red brick, gray with lichens; the rows\r\nof wide stone-mullioned windows and hanging oriels; the delicate,\r\nfanciful chimneys rising in great clusters above the pointed gables; the\r\nbroad stone steps leading up to the hospitable door; the smooth green\r\nterraces and bowling-lawns, walled in, it is true, but closed with gates\r\nof curiously-wrought ironwork meant more for ornament than for\r\ndefence,--all these serve to recall the days when learning and wealth\r\njoined hands with the Maiden Queen to raise England from the depths into\r\nwhich she had sunk--the days of \"the worthies whom Elizabeth, without\r\ndistinction of rank or age, gathered round her in the ever-glorious wars\r\nof her great reign.\"\r\n\r\nIt was then that Burleigh and Walsingham talked statecraft; that Raleigh\r\nand Drake, Frobisher and Grenville, sailed the seas and beat the Spanish\r\nArmada; that the \"sea-dogs\" brought the treasures of the New World to\r\nthe feet of the queen, and filled men's minds with dreams of El Dorados\r\nwhere gold and jewels were as common as the sand on the seashore. It was\r\nthen that English literature, all but dead during the storm of the\r\nReformation, began to revive. And then it was that a galaxy of poets\r\narose such as the world had never seen before; that Sidney wrote his\r\n_Arcadia_, Spenser his _Faerie Queene_; that Christopher Marlowe,\r\nBeaumont and Fletcher and merrie Ben Jonson founded the English drama;\r\nand that Shakespeare, poet of poets, overshadowed them all with that\r\nstupendous genius which has filled succeeding generations with wonder\r\nand love.\r\n\r\nThen it was that men began to think of their home as a casket in which\r\nto enshrine the gentler tastes and luxuries which peace at home and\r\ncontinental influences from without were fostering in England. The\r\ncasket must be fitted for its treasure; and so it came to pass that\r\nthroughout the length and breadth of the land those fair Elizabethan\r\nmansions sprang up.\r\n\r\nI see one such now in my mind's eye--one that I love well, for since my\r\nearliest childhood it has filled me with awe and admiration and delight.\r\nIt was built by James I. as a hunting-box for his son, Prince Henry, but\r\nere the house was finished the young prince was dead, and all the\r\npromise of his short life gone with him. Had he lived, our English\r\nhistory for the next hundred years might have been a different story.\r\nBramshill then passed into other hands--first to Lord Zouch, then to the\r\nCopes, who still own it--but in the finely-carved stone balustrade above\r\nthe great western door the three plumes of the prince of Wales's\r\nfeathers may still be seen, the sole memento of its royal origin. Only\r\nhalf the original house remains: the rest was destroyed by fire a couple\r\nof hundred years ago. Yet what still stands is verily a palace.\r\n\r\nYou enter through the heavily-nailed and barred doors, and find yourself\r\nin a vast hall panelled up to the ceiling with old oak. The immense\r\nfireplace with its brass dogs and andirons tells of the yule log that\r\nstill at Christmas burns upon the hearth, and trophies of arms of all\r\nages--from the Toledo blade that can be bent by the point into a\r\nsemicircle, so perfect is the temper of its steel, to the Sikh sword\r\nthat was brought home after the Indian mutiny--form fitting ornaments\r\nfor the walls.\r\n\r\nThen come many rooms, with deep-embrasured windows looking out on the\r\nterrace, each beautiful or curious in its own way--a noble dining-room\r\nhung with old grisaille tapestry, from which you may learn the life of\r\nDecius Mus if you have patience to disentangle the strange medley of\r\nimpossible figures in gardens with impossible flowers, where impossible\r\nbeasts roam in herds and impossible birds sing among the branches.\r\n\r\nBut the glory of the house is its first floor. The wide oak staircase\r\nleads you up first to the chapel-room, with its oriel windows\r\noverhanging the western door, its Italian cabinets, its rare china, its\r\nchairs and couches covered with crewel-work more than two hundred years\r\nold, yet with colors as fresh as on the day that Lady Zouch and her\r\nmaidens set in the stitches. Then there is the great drawing-room, with\r\nits precious Italian marble chimney-piece, more brass dogs, more\r\ntapestry, more recessed windows. Then the library, full of priceless\r\nbooks, to which the present learned owner is constantly adding new\r\nvolumes. The mere ceilings are a study in themselves, for they are\r\ncovered with mouldings and traceries and hanging bosses of marvellous\r\nworkmanship of the time of Inigo Jones--designed, some say, by him, for\r\nhe used to stay at Eversley, hard by, with a friend and fellow-pupil of\r\nSir Christopher Wren. Then comes the long gallery, running the whole\r\nwidth of the building, stored with curiosities, where we used to run\r\nraces and play hide-and-seek with the children of the house in bygone\r\ndays, and tremble when evening came on lest some bogie from his\r\nlurking-place should spring out upon us. The bedrooms are panelled with\r\noak painted white, with splendid fireplaces and carved mantelpieces that\r\nreach the ceiling.\r\n\r\nAnd besides all these there are enchanting little rooms reached by\r\nunexpected staircases, by secret doors in the wall, by dark passages\r\nwhere one hears the rustle of ghostly brocade dresses. Those are the\r\nmost lovable rooms, for, once safely in them, one is at home and warm,\r\nwhile in the state rooms one feels, as the dear old squire who died here\r\nthirty years ago said, \"like a pea in a drum.\"\r\n\r\nDown from the house slopes the park, with its green glades, its\r\nheather-covered knolls, its huge oaks, its delicate silver\r\nbirches--above all, its matchless Scotch firs, which James I. planted\r\nhere, as he did in many places in England, to remind himself of the land\r\nof his birth. The hardy northern trees took kindly to their new home,\r\nand they have seeded themselves and spread far and wide over vast tracts\r\nof country. But nowhere south of Tweed are finer specimens to be found\r\nthan in this old Hampshire park. Three great avenues of them run round a\r\ntriangle half a mile across, and outside the shade of their black\r\nbranches the purple heather and waving bracken form a carpet fit for\r\nelves and fairies.\r\n\r\nFrom the western front of the house a double avenue of gigantic elms\r\nleads down to the river that gleams in silver lines beneath the bridge,\r\nand ends where the moors begin on the opposite hill a mile away. Up this\r\navenue in olden days the deer were driven toward the house, to be killed\r\nat the feet of the ladies, who stepped down in hoops and furbelows and\r\ndainty shoes to the iron gates between two pepper-box towers where\r\ngorgeous peacocks now strut and sun themselves.\r\n\r\nThose were the days when, sorely against his own wish, Archbishop\r\nAbbot, my worthy ancestor, went a-hunting in the park on Sunday at the\r\ncommand of the king his master, who with the archbishop was a guest of\r\nLord Zouch. Well for him had it been if he had resisted the royal will,\r\nfor, as it befell, the arrow from his crossbow, glancing from a tree,\r\nstruck one of the keepers and killed him then and there. The poor\r\narchbishop, it is said, never smiled again, and his sad, tender face in\r\nVandyke's noble picture looks down on me from the wall as I write and\r\nbears out the truth of the story. Often and often when we children were\r\nplaying in the park did we wander about, trying to settle from which\r\ntree the arrow glanced, conjuring up before our eyes the whole\r\nscene--the king's anger and the archbishop's despair at the\r\ncatastrophe--and feeling the while a proud personal interest in it all.\r\nAh, what good days those were, roaming about knee-deep in heather,\r\ncatching the rare moths, chasing the squirrels that whisked up the fir\r\nstems and mocked us from their high perch, searching the hollow trees\r\nfor woodpeckers' nests, eating the beech-nuts or pricking our fingers as\r\nwe tried to open the husks of the Spanish chestnuts that grew by the\r\nlake! From among the bulrushes the coots sailed out at our approach, and\r\nthe tiny dabchick dived so deep that we thought, \"This time she _must_\r\nbe drowned,\" when, lo and behold! she would appear twenty yards off, a\r\nlittle black ball with a yellow bill, only to take breath and plunge\r\nagain. Sometimes in a hard winter we would hear high in the sky the cry\r\nof a weird pack of hounds. Nearer and nearer drew that unearthly music,\r\ntill we held our breath in a kind of delightful terror, and then above\r\nour heads appeared a flock of wild swans on the search for water; and\r\ndown they dropped, like white cannon-balls, into the lake, sending a\r\nmass of spray into the air and shivering the smooth black surface of the\r\nwater into a thousand ripples that circled away and lapped against the\r\nbanks in mimic waves.\r\n\r\nBut I think my most exquisite moment of happiness was one spring day\r\nwhen I saw close by me a little fox-cub--a furry darling, about as big\r\nas a four-months'-old kitten, with black stripes across his fat back. He\r\nhad ventured out of the fox-earths on the other side of the park\r\npalings, and did not know how to get back to his anxious mother. I tried\r\nto catch him, but that was not to be, and young Reineke soon found a way\r\nhome. Nevertheless, the joy was mine, never to be forgotten, of having\r\nseen a real wild beast so near.\r\n\r\nEven on dark and stormy days the park has its own strange charm as one\r\nwalks up the gloomy avenue on the soft fir-needles glistening with rain.\r\nA murmur fills the air as of sea-waves beating on the shore: it is the\r\nwet south-west wind soughing overhead and lashing the writhing branches.\r\nOne thinks of the German fairy-tales, and half expects to meet the old\r\nwoman who led Hansel and Grethel captive, or to come suddenly upon her\r\nhouse with its ginger-bread roof and barley-sugar windows.\r\n\r\nI remember once taking a well-known musician through those fir woods one\r\ndark afternoon as the wind was making soft music above us. He was\r\nsilent, and I was disappointed, for I had fancied that the new country\r\nwould delight him and excite his imagination. But when we reached home\r\nhe sat down to the piano in the dark, and played on and on as if he were\r\npouring out his whole soul in the flood of sweet melody; and when, after\r\nan hour of marvellous improvisation, he stopped and said to us, \"I\r\ncouldn't help it: I had to reel off all that I have been seeing and\r\nhearing this afternoon,\" then I was content, for I knew nothing had been\r\nthrown away on our friend, and that if he could not talk about it all he\r\ncould do even better.\r\n\r\nBut if you would see Bramshill in all its pride come on some November\r\nmorning to the first meet of the season.\r\n\r\nWell do I recollect the excitement of those happy days. How long the\r\nnight seemed before morning broke and I was sure it was not pouring with\r\nrain! How pleasant to run down to breakfast all neat and trim in one's\r\nhabit! And then when flask and sandwiches were safely bestowed, white\r\ngloves buttoned and hat firmly secured, how eagerly I watched for\r\nhalf-past ten to walk out to the stables, where the horses were stamping\r\nand snorting impatiently, knowing full well by their marvellous instinct\r\nwhat enjoyment was before them! Then my little bay Sintram came dancing\r\nout, followed by Puff, the dear old brown mare. I was tossed into the\r\nsaddle, and away we went at that peculiarly unpleasant and tiring pace,\r\na \"cover trot,\" which for some inscrutable reason is the right thing if\r\nyou are going to a meet. Less than a trot, more than a walk, you can\r\nneither sit still nor rise in your stirrup, but must just jog along till\r\nyou fairly ache. The horses pull and fight with their bits as we keep\r\nthem in the soft sandy ditch up the lane to spare their precious feet.\r\nAt the few cottages we pass women and children are all standing at their\r\ngarden-gates to watch the \"quality\" go by. The ploughmen in the fields\r\ndiscover that the furrows nearest the road need a great deal of\r\nattention; the shepherds fold their sheep to-day close to the hedge, so\r\nas to secure front places for the show; and if we chance to run this way\r\nevery man will leave his work and follow us as long as his breath lasts,\r\nand his master, who is riding, will not grumble, for if hounds are\r\nrunning every man, be he rich or poor, has a right to run too.\r\n\r\nUp the sandy hill we go, and out on the wide moors, covered with soft\r\nbrown heather, which stretch away with hardly a break twenty miles south\r\nand east to Aldershot Camp or Windsor Forest. On the brow of the hill\r\ngrows a mighty bush of furze which always goes by the name of \"Miss\r\nBremer's furze-bush.\" When the dainty Swedish novelist once came to\r\ngladden Eversley Rectory with her presence she told how she longed to\r\nsee the plant before which Linnaeus had fallen on his knees; and she\r\nwalked up this selfsame hill and with eyes full of tears gazed on the\r\nprickly shrub with its mist of golden-colored, apricot-scented flowers.\r\nThe old Hampshire proverb says, \"When furze is out of flower kissing is\r\nout of fashion;\" and, sure enough, there is not a month in the year in\r\nwhich you may not find a blossom or two among the green spines.\r\n\r\nNow we cross a green road, the Welsh Ride, which in the autumn is\r\ncovered with thousands of cattle making their way in great herds from\r\nthe Welsh mountains and Devonshire pastures to the winter fairs round\r\nLondon. The drovers used to boast that they could bring their beasts all\r\nthe way from Wales without once going off turf or through a turnpike.\r\nNow, alas! crowded cattle-trucks on the railway are fast superseding the\r\nold-fashioned, wholesome way of travelling, and we seldom have the\r\nautumnal air filled with the lowing of the herds, the barking of the\r\nattendant dogs and the shouts of the drovers on their sturdy Welsh\r\nponies. But to-day the Welsh Ride looks gay enough, for it is dotted\r\nwith little knots of horsemen in black or red coats using it as a short\r\ncut from Aldershot and Sandhurst. We turn off the moor into the shadow\r\nof the fir avenue that leads half a mile up to the park-gates. The\r\nground, covered with a soft carpet of pine-needles and burrowed\r\neverywhere by the roots of the trees, gives off a hollow echo to the\r\nhorses' clattering hoofs. The sombre avenue is alive in unwonted fashion\r\nto-day. Now we pass a group of pedestrians from the village; now a young\r\nfarmer comes by on a half-broken colt which is to make its first\r\nacquaintance with the hounds; then a break with a big party from a\r\ncountry-house in Miss Mitford's village passes us with a gay greeting as\r\nit rattles on. A tiny nutshell of a pony-carriage full of babies comes\r\ntrotting along, and its driver, poor Sheldon Williams, will make notes\r\nof the scene and put them into one of his clever hunting-pictures,\r\nlittle dreaming of the day when his early death will leave those babies\r\npenniless. Now a group of the redcoats we saw on the Welsh Ride\r\novertakes us, and Sintram plunges and dances as a wild little\r\nthorough-bred comes up to our side. His master, who has already gained\r\nhis Victoria Cross twice--first as a little lad in the trenches at\r\nSevastopol, and again for desperate deeds of valor in the Indian\r\nmutiny--is to win yet further glory in 1879 at the head of the \"flying\r\ncolumn\" in Zululand--Evelyn Wood, the most gallant and humane of all\r\nthat gallant band.\r\n\r\nThe white park-gate is held wide open by a poor ne'er-do-weel in a\r\nshabby old red coat--John Ellis by name. How he gets his living no one\r\nknows, but if there is a meet of fox-hounds anywhere within ten miles,\r\nthere he is sure to be, holding people's horses or ready at a gate for\r\nstray pennies and sixpences. There is usually such a hanger-on to every\r\npack of hounds in England--one who travels immense distances on foot to\r\nturn up in unexpected places and get a few hard-earned shillings as his\r\nreward. We jog along under the magnificent silver firs, only to be\r\nequalled by those in the duke of Wellington's park at Strathfieldsaye,\r\nhard by; then up the lime avenue which borders the cricket-ground, where\r\nthirty years ago the most famous matches in Hampshire were played; and\r\nas we reach the iron gates leading up to the house our little knot of\r\nriders has swelled into a veritable cavalcade.\r\n\r\nDown the drive we trot, past the stables, where the watch-dogs strain\r\nangrily at their chains and a little green monkey jibbers with rage and\r\nexcitement, and in another moment we turn under the shadow of the great\r\nhouse up to the western door. Here all is life and bustle. Twenty or\r\nthirty carriages are drawn up by the widespreading lawn: grooms are\r\nholding horses ready for their masters, who are refreshing the inner man\r\nwith cherry brandy and cold breakfast indoors. A tinkle of bells is\r\nheard as the duchess of Wellington drives herself up with her three\r\nponies abreast, Russian fashion. Then a perfectly-appointed brougham,\r\nwith a pair of magnificent cobs, stops in a corner, and a soldier-like\r\nforeigner in a red coat helps out a quiet-looking English lady wrapped\r\nup in furs. She slips them off as her groom leads up a priceless horse\r\nfor her to mount, and in a moment is in the saddle, and will ride as\r\nstraight as any man in the field to-day. Her husband, Count Morella,\r\nbetter known as the famous Carlist general Cabrera, whose strange and\r\nterrible history many years ago fascinated the gentle English heiress,\r\nnow satisfies his war-like spirit by fox-hunting on the best horses that\r\nmoney can buy, and has settled down into a quiet English country\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\nThe hounds have arrived before us. There they are--the beauties!--on the\r\ngreen grass, and we ride in among them to have a word with Tom Swetman\r\nthe huntsman and good George Austin the whip, the latter of whom has\r\ngiven me a lead over many a fence. Gallant Tom! the bravest and gentlest\r\nof men, how little we thought that in a year or two we should never see\r\nyour honest face again on earth! But you will be long remembered, though\r\nyou are with us no more, and the story will be told for years to come of\r\na day when the hounds ran into their fox on the South-western Railway.\r\nIt was in a cutting fifty feet deep, with a tremendous fence at the top.\r\nTom arrived just in time to see his hounds on the rails, with poor\r\nReynard dead in their midst and the express train from Southampton\r\nspeeding up the hill at fifty miles an hour. He crammed his horse over\r\nthe great post and rails, down the almost perpendicular side of the\r\ncutting, whipped the hounds off, and, as the train rushed screaming by,\r\nrode out from under the very wheels of the engine and up the farther\r\nbank with his rescued pack.\r\n\r\nBut now our master, Mr. Garth, comes down the steps--a signal that we\r\nmust no longer waste time talking with our neighbors, and like a good\r\nold friend he gives us a private programme of the way we shall draw.\r\nStirrups are lengthened or shortened, girths tightened, restive horses\r\nled away to unobserved corners where their owners can try to mount\r\nwithout being seen by the assembled multitude. Sintram executes a\r\nwar-dance on his hind legs, to the delight of some schoolboys in a\r\nwagonette, the terror of their fair companions and the extreme disgust\r\nof his mistress at having to practice the _haute ecole_ before so large\r\nan audience. Ah, my poor Sintram! He danced once too often, and one fine\r\nday came to a sad end by falling backward and breaking his neck.\r\n\r\nTom now comes up to the master: \"Shall we go, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--now, I think.\"\r\n\r\nA crack of the whips and away trots Tom, followed by his splendid pack\r\nand his two whippers-in. Then comes the master, and we all crowd after\r\nthem pell-mell with horses plunging and kicking, and as soon as we are\r\nfairly out in the open a kind of stampede takes place among the unruly\r\nyoung ones, and we see many an involuntary steeple-chase over the smooth\r\ngreen cricket-ground. Through the dark avenues of fir trees we canter to\r\nthe temple, a little summerhouse on a promontory in the sea of wood that\r\nlies below, and we stand admiring the far blue distant view away to the\r\nHogsback and the South Downs beyond Basingstoke as the hounds begin\r\ntheir work. There they are: you can see their twinkling tails as they\r\ndraw the heather-covered slopes beneath us and disappear among the\r\ngolden-brown bracken, while one of the whips plunges down after them and\r\nshakes a shower of amber leaves from the silver birches as he brushes\r\npast them.\r\n\r\nSomething streaks away down a green drive. A young hound gives tongue,\r\nbut his note of triumph quickly changes to a yelp as the vigilant whip\r\ncatches him with the tip of his long lash and roars, \"War'[1] hare!\"\r\nPoor little man! He has tried to run what is called a \"short-tailed\r\nfox,\" and returns to the pack a sadder and a wiser dog. But now the\r\ntails twinkle faster than ever. A low whimper from some of the old\r\nhounds, then a burst of joyous music from the pack.\r\n\r\n\"Gone away!\" yells Tom, standing up in his stirrups and tooting his\r\nhorn.\r\n\r\nThen that unmistakable screech which is supposed to mean \"Tally-ho!\"\r\nfrom a group of beaters and keepers in the distance, and there, against\r\nthe park-palings, a beautiful red thing scudding along the soft ride,\r\nflat to the ground, his bushy tail flying straight behind him. Reynard\r\nhimself! Now let all look out for themselves. Adieu, carriages! adieu,\r\npoor pedestrians! We are off, and shall not see you again till\r\ndinner-time. Through the park-gate we stream away, down the fir avenue,\r\nalong the Welsh Ride. We have got a splendid start, and our horses fly\r\non beside Countess Morella, who looks the perfection of a hunting lady\r\nin her plain neat habit just down to her feet.\r\n\r\nReynard is making for Coombes's Wood, but the earths were all stopped\r\nthis morning at four o'clock; so away he speeds again, leaving the\r\nrectory and its lovely meadows and the dear old church below us--away\r\npast the bogs where the cotton-grass and the flycatcher, the blue\r\ngentian and the yellow asphodel, grow among the treacherous\r\ntussocks--away to Eversley Wood. Here the same fate--a fagot or three or\r\nfour sods in the mouth of each hole--awaits him; so, changing his\r\ntactics, he strikes boldly across Hartfordbridge Flats for Lord\r\nCalthorpe's woods at Elvetham.\r\n\r\nAnd now woe to the unwary or to the newcomer who thinks our\r\nheather-covered moors are all plain sailing! for along them run long\r\nlines of ruts, the remains of the old pack-road of the Middle Ages, worn\r\nby the traffic of centuries and now covered deep in purple heath. The\r\nonly way to get over them, unless you stop and walk, is to jump boldly\r\ninto the middle like the man in the nursery rhyme, and then jump out\r\nagain: horses that have been in the country for a while soon learn to do\r\nthis. But some luckless ensign who has lately joined his regiment at\r\nAldershot comes down bodily, and horse and man roll and struggle in the\r\ndeep ruts which William the Conqueror's pack-horses helped to tread out\r\nas they came from London to Winchester.\r\n\r\nNow the woods are drawing near, and we cross the old London road, the\r\nhigh-road between the metropolis and Southampton, along which ninety\r\nstagecoaches ran every day in the good old times. A mile off to our\r\nright, down Star Hill, lies the famous White Lion Inn, now a miserable\r\npot-house, where George IV. used to stay, and where, on the day that the\r\nLondon and South-western Railway was opened, the old ostler cut his\r\nthroat in sheer despair, for Othello's occupation was gone. Ten miles\r\nup the road lies Bagshot Heath, the terror of travellers in those\r\ncoaching days. There stood, and stands still, a little wayside inn\r\ncalled the Golden Farmer, where many of the coaches stopped to water the\r\nhorses. The wearied travellers of the end of last century, touched by\r\nthe tender solicitude of the charming landlord, confided to his\r\nsympathetic ear their fears of the highwaymen who were said to infest\r\nthe heath. Cheered and encouraged with assurances from their host of the\r\nperfect safety of the particular road they intended taking, the\r\ntravellers set out. But usually, when they had gone about a mile, the\r\ncoach would stop with a sudden jerk, and a masked man on a magnificent\r\nhorse would ride up, pistol in hand, and demand their money or their\r\nlife. Sometimes serious encounters took place with this leader and his\r\nband, and then the wounded and terrified victims would drag themselves\r\nback to the Golden Farmer, where the host, full of commiseration for\r\ntheir misfortunes, would lavish care and kindness upon them. This went\r\non for years, and it was not until hundreds of robberies had been\r\ncommitted that the discovery was made of the identity of the fascinating\r\nlandlord and the desperate captain of the highwaymen.\r\n\r\nMany are the tales the old people at Eversley used to tell of the\r\n\"gentlemen of the road\" in their fathers' and grandfathers' time. Even\r\nin quiet Eversley itself a curate lived some hundred years ago whose\r\nstrange career ended on the gallows. He owned a splendid black horse\r\nwhich no one ever saw him mount. But it was whispered that if any one\r\npeeped into its stable in the morning the beautiful creature was seen\r\ncovered with foam, bathed in perspiration, trembling as if it had just\r\ncome in from a long gallop; and at last it was found out that Parson\r\nDarby belonged to the gang of highwaymen on Bagshot Heath. He was caught\r\nred-handed, and hanged close to the Golden Farmer in chains on a gibbet\r\nof which the posts were still standing forty years ago. But what became\r\nof his black horse no one ever could tell me. Now the London road is as\r\nsafe and quiet as any other well-kept highway, and the wildest\r\npassengers upon it are a few wandering gypsies, who travel up and down\r\nit from fair to race and from race to fair.\r\n\r\nBut Reynard is speeding away through the pleasant fir woods, and we are\r\nfollowing him as fast as we can lay legs to ground--scrambling over the\r\nrotten banks, scurrying along the soft rides, lying low on our saddles\r\nto avoid the sweeping boughs, and watching with all our eyes for the\r\nslippery roots that crawl along the surface of the sandy soil. Down\r\nthrough the bogs, across the bridge by the home farm, past the park,\r\ninto the fallow fields, with half a dozen tremendous fences which send\r\nmy heart up into my throat till Sintram lands me safe over each, into\r\nthe fir woods again, up to the foot of the Queen's Mounts; and there,\r\nwhere good Queen Bess sat and watched the deer being driven up to her\r\nfeet, do we run into our gallant fox, and a \"Whoo-hoop!\" from Tom\r\nproclaims that Reynard is no more.\r\n\r\nBut our run has led us far from home, and while the hounds trot on to\r\nDogmersfield Park to draw the coverts of the descendants of the old\r\nregicide Mildmay, let us wend our way once more to Bramshill and linger\r\na while longer about the terraces and gardens of the dear old house.\r\n\r\nCome back with me, gentle reader, through the iron gates under the\r\ncrumbling archways of the pleasaunce, where the Virginia creeper twines\r\nits delicate wreaths and glorifies the old stones in autumn with a flush\r\nof flame. The troco-ground, with its green turf as smooth as a\r\nbilliard-table, is just as it was in the days of King James. There in\r\nthe centre is the iron ring through which the lords and dames drove the\r\nheavy wooden troco-balls; and if you go into the garden-hall through\r\nthat arched corridor you will see the actual balls that they used, and\r\nthe long poles, with a kind of iron cup at their ends, with which the\r\nplayers pushed them--forerunners of the modern croquet-box that lies\r\nbeside them.\r\n\r\nUnder the sunny walls run straight wide borders, where the bees make\r\nmerry among pinks and lilies, mignonette and gilliflowers, and the walls\r\nthemselves are tangled with old-fashioned roses and honeysuckles. One\r\ndouble yellow rose tree of prodigious age is kept as the apple of the\r\ngardener's eye. Tradition tells that it was brought a hundred years ago\r\nfrom Damascus--a fact which I am quite willing to believe, for the\r\nknotted stem tells its own story, and certainly there never was a\r\nsweeter rose or one more worthy of coming from the far-famed gardens of\r\nthe East. Many a thousand blossoms have I picked from its descendants,\r\nfor it is the ancestor of a hardy race: every sucker of the family grows\r\nand thrives in the poorest soil, and covers itself each June with a\r\nthick mass of canary-colored blossoms. During the three weeks that the\r\nyellow briers were in flower every room in Eversley Rectory was decked\r\nout with flat bowls of them on a ground of green ferns, and purple-black\r\npansies mingled with their golden blooms.\r\n\r\nRound about the house masses of another yellow flower are planted with\r\nno sparing hand--the great St. John's wort. It is pleasant to look upon,\r\nbut it has another value. Dare I tell it in the nineteenth century, this\r\nage of railroads and telegraphs and iron-clads, when space and time are\r\nin a fair way to be annihilated, and nothing is so sacred that it may\r\nnot be questioned, no problem so hard that men may not try to solve it?\r\nIn the days when Bramshill House was built our forefathers believed\r\nfirmly in a whole unseen or rarely-seen world around them of fairies,\r\nghosts, spirits and witches. In some out-of-the-way corners in\r\nEngland--even in these days of board schools and competitive\r\nexaminations, when we are told that King Arthur never existed and that\r\nWilliam Tell is a \"sun-myth\"--some remnants of this belief still linger.\r\nIn Devonshire folks speak shyly and with bated breath of the \"good\r\npeople;\" and even in the year of grace 1879 a Warwickshire laborer was\r\nhad up before the magistrates for having with a pitchfork half killed a\r\npoor old woman whom he declared to be a witch. But be that as it may, in\r\nthe reign of James I. no one doubted the existence of the spirit-world\r\nabout us, and on St. John's Eve all its denizens, good and bad, were\r\nsupposed to wander freely where they would. One only thing they feared,\r\nand that was the great St. John's wort. Therefore, all who wished to\r\nguard house and home from the unwelcome visitors, who pinched the maids,\r\nturned the milk sour and plagued their victims with a thousand impish\r\ntricks, planted it freely about their gardens; and thus it is that you\r\nsee its golden flowers amid their shining rich green leaves and crimson\r\nshoots round nearly all old English homes.\r\n\r\nDo not laugh at these old fables, gentle reader. When we wander over the\r\ngreen turf and through the wide halls we seem to have opened a door that\r\nleads us back into the past out of the turmoil of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. And surely for a moment it can do us no harm to leave our\r\nstriving, hurrying, anxious modern life, and picture to ourselves the\r\ndays when our forefathers maybe were ignorant and superstitious, but\r\nwhen they knew how to build and how to fight and how to write--the days\r\nwhen England became \"a nest of singing birds.\"\r\n\r\n  ROSE G. KINGSLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] In hunting dialect the warning \"'ware\" or \"beware\" is shortened to\r\n\"war',\" as in the old advice, \"War' horse, war' hound, war' heel!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANOEING ON THE HIGH MISSISSIPPI.\r\n\r\nTWO PAPERS.--I.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Kleiner Fritz and Hattie of Louisville and the Betsy D. of\r\nCincinnati made the canoe-fleet which the Northern Pacific Railway\r\nshunted out upon its station-platform at Detroit City, Minnesota, in the\r\nearly gray of last July's first Thursday. We had bargained by post with\r\nBeaulieu, a shrewd, wiry, reckless French half-breed, for transportation\r\nof ourselves, canoes, equipment and provisions to Itasca Lake, or to a\r\npoint upon the Mississippi five miles below the lake, as we might elect.\r\nHis assurance was that four days and forty-one dollars would carry us to\r\nour first objective point. His helpers were a lively young half-breed,\r\nson-in-law of the murdered chief Hole-in-the-Day, another big mongrel,\r\nfat, plodding and reticent, and a young Indian who could speak a few\r\nEnglish words, but was destitute of ideas in either English or Chippewa.\r\nTheir motive-power was grazing on the open prairie back of the ragged\r\nvillage. The Reservation Indian, denied liquor at home, reckons upon a\r\ntrip out of bounds as fair opportunity for a spree, so that catching and\r\nharnessing the ponies and cattle was a tedious task that covered the\r\nhours from breakfast well on toward noon; but at last the Hattie was\r\nfirmly imbedded in prairie-grass and soft luggage upon one wagon, the\r\nFritz and the Betsy were bound together upon a second, and the men of\r\nthe fleet, with the stores, filled the third.\r\n\r\nFrom Detroit City to Itasca Lake is about forty miles in a straight\r\nline, but no practicable way thither approximates to a direct line, and\r\nhe who would see the beautiful lake and the head of the great river must\r\ntravel for seven or eight days and endure many hardships. Sixty miles\r\nwere to be done on wheels. The first day's travel was to White Earth\r\nAgency, twenty-two miles across a rolling prairie which steadily rises\r\ntoward its climax in the Hauteur des Terres. The soil is of rare\r\nfertility, and the unbounded fields were clothed in the greenest of\r\ngreen, flecked with wild flowers of every hue in luxuriant profusion.\r\nClumps of trees gave variety to the broad and beautiful view, while\r\nscores of clear little lakes gemmed the prairie as with great drops of\r\nmolten silver. The eye swept an horizon of twenty miles, and once twenty\r\nleagues were within our visual grasp. The plodding fat man went his way\r\nin a dignified walk, but the passenger vehicle and that which bore the\r\nother boats, travelling by order of Beaulieu, who had in him more\r\nDetroit whiskey than ordinary discretion, came more than half the way at\r\na terrible gait, spite of our remonstrances and greatly to our\r\ntrepidation. Examination showed that the Betsy was racked and pounded\r\nbeyond all excuse, while the poor Fritz revealed a hole in its graceful\r\nside like that made by a six-pound cannon-shot--a sad beginning for so\r\nlong a cruise. Thence we went on slowly to the agency, where our first\r\ntask was to find a clever Vermont Yankee reputed as the man to repair\r\nthe unwelcome and inexcusable damage. The ingenious and genial fellow\r\nworked through the hot Fourth of July, while we mingled with the Indians\r\nand took part in their celebration, the first ever conducted entirely by\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nWhite Earth Agency is the seat of government of three reservations which\r\nembrace the homes of all the Chippewas. White Earth Reservation is\r\nthirty-six miles square, and is peopled by nearly seventeen hundred\r\nIndians and half-breeds. These were formerly gathered upon Crow Wing\r\nRiver, near Brainerd, where they existed in drunkenness, barbarism and\r\ndestitution. In 1868 they were removed here, and the institutions of\r\nChristian civilization were introduced. They live in comfortable cabins\r\nand bark lodges. The agent, Major C.A. Ruffee, is a gentleman of\r\ncapacity and integrity. Using his authority well and wisely, he is a\r\nking throughout his dominion of thirteen hundred square miles. His happy\r\nblending of civil and military government gives satisfaction to all who\r\nare well disposed. The Chippewas deal kindly among themselves, and have\r\nno quarrels with the whites. They have a well-arranged police system,\r\nwith a chief, lieutenants and sergeants, embracing sixteen men in all,\r\nand directly responsible to the agent. No liquor is allowed on the\r\nreservation. They have no pilfering, and the few locks and bolts are\r\nrarely needed. In case of trespass or disagreement the parties come or\r\nare summoned before the agent, who examines the case on its merits,\r\nweighs the facts and the equities, decides; and there the quarrel ends.\r\n\r\nThe seat of the agency is an orderless village gathered about a\r\ngreen-shored little lake, and includes the office of the agent, the\r\npost-office, a warehouse for supplies, a meat-shop, two trading-stores\r\nand an untidy and comfortless hotel. Near by is the neat cottage of the\r\nagent, a large and comely boarding-school, an industrial school, and the\r\nresidences of the chief clerk and of the head-farmer, who teaches and\r\naids the Indians in practical farming. Not far away to the south is the\r\nRoman Catholic church; a mile to the north is the hospital, a large and\r\ncheerful building; and near the hospital are the tasteful Protestant\r\nEpiscopal chapel and the rectory of the Rev. Mr. Gilfillan, who for\r\nfourteen years has worthily occupied a parish coextensive with the\r\nChippewa Nation. The true solution of the Indian question is being\r\nworked out at White Earth in results that augur well for the future.\r\nEach child may secure education, and the minds and morals of all ages\r\nare cared for. Their churches are well attended and their schools have\r\noutgrown present accommodations. Their religious services and schools\r\nare conducted in their own language. They have an educated Indian\r\nclergyman who can scarcely speak English, while Mr. Gilfillan speaks the\r\nChippewa as fluently as his mother-tongue. They have few quarrels, no\r\nthieving, no drunkenness, no abject poverty. They are not more perfect\r\nthan others of human kind, but according to their light and sphere they\r\nare as good as a similar average of whites anywhere. The wise purpose is\r\nto make them kind, moral, educated and industrious Indians, not\r\nmake-believe white men, and the work is doing and promising well in\r\nsincere and capable hands.\r\n\r\nThe Indian Fourth-of-July celebration took place in an open, treeless\r\nprairie. The festivities centred in a series of races run in pairs by\r\nthe small and wiry Indian ponies over a curved, mowed and rolled\r\nhalf-mile course. Nearly all the young men were betters, in stakes of\r\nfrom twenty-five cents to ten dollars. There were no pools, but hard\r\nrunning, straight betting and square paying. The chief of police was the\r\npresident of the course. All were in good-humor. There was no liquor,\r\nneither was there a harsh word or a blow among the five hundred. After\r\nthe races eatables, tea, coffee and ice-water were enjoyed with laughter\r\nand chat. In the evening we cruisers gave a show of rockets and Roman\r\ncandles, to the great delight of the Indians, and the day closed with a\r\ndance in the large dining-hall of the boarding-school.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ACROSS THE PRAIRIE.]\r\n\r\nOur damaged boats repaired and preparations completed for three weeks'\r\nabsence from civilization, we set out near mid-day of Saturday for the\r\nmarch to Wild Rice River, eighteen miles. Our way lay among the cabins,\r\nlodges and farms of the Chippewas, over a billowy, green immensity\r\nbordered on the east by the lines of the Hauteur des Terres, which shut\r\nus from the Mississippi Valley, and horizoned on the west by the slopes\r\nbeyond the famed Red River of the North. Our day's journey terminated,\r\nin a driving rainstorm, on the banks of Wild Rice River, where are a\r\ntrading-store, the cabin of the trader and a neat chapel of the\r\nProtestant Episcopal mission. Our habitation for the night was a dark,\r\nmuddy, odorous storehouse, in whose nether apartment we munched a frugal\r\nsupper, then climbed a ladder to beds upon the bare floor between stacks\r\nof snake-root, which had accumulated from barterings with the Indians.\r\nDuring the night the rainstorm grew to a gale which rocked our night's\r\nhome like a ship at sea to the music of heaven's grand diapasons. Sunday\r\nmorning, impelled by the expense of our large retinue and the\r\ncheerlessness of our refuge, we pushed on for the foot of Wild Rice\r\nLake, twenty miles distant over prairies and through forests. Two miles\r\nout we were overtaken by another fierce storm, which drove us to the\r\nshelter of the last human habitation, save two others near by, that we\r\nshould see for three weeks. The broad, sweeping bow of the black cloud,\r\nthe peculiar detonations of thunder in that clear atmosphere, the rush\r\nof wind, rain and hail, unhindered by the treeless and trackless moor,\r\nwere lessons of God's majesty and power more impressive than cathedral\r\nmass or prayer and song and psalm of men. Out of the storm's first onset\r\nwe rushed unasked into the hut of an Indian family, and surprised a pair\r\nof squaws and a six-months' pappoose squatting on a dirty and\r\nrain-pooled floor in almost total darkness. In an hour the storm had\r\ngone its eastward way, the sun shone out, and we resumed our trail among\r\nspruces, pines, oaks and elms to the foot of the lake, where we were to\r\ndismiss our prairie-schooners. Monday, with the early sun, we left teams\r\nand drivers, to push on by lakes, up rivers and through the pathless\r\nwilderness beyond all roads and habitations. Our party was reduced to\r\nthe barest needs for the severe work before us. Besides our three\r\nselves we had a corps of five Indians as guides and packers, each of\r\nwhom was a character, and all bore themselves through four days of\r\nsevere work honestly, cheerfully and helpfully. They were Henry St.\r\nClair, a half-breed, our interpreter, to whom we could only address\r\nmeasured monosyllables with any hope of imparting ideas, but always\r\nfaithful, frank and wise; Kewashawkonce, the guide, a man of push and a\r\ngenuine wag; Kawaybawgo, a huge hunter, whose old long shot-gun has\r\nbanged over almost every acre of these wilds; Metagooe, a sleepy,\r\nthick-headed fellow; and Waisonbekton, young and active, always ready\r\nfor work or burden and constantly alert for new and interesting things\r\nin Nature.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of Wild Rice Lake we prepared our canoes for voyaging, and\r\nbegan our long paddle toward the source of the Mississippi, whence we\r\nwere to descend to civilization. A brief description of our little ships\r\nand equipment will help to a better understanding of our cruise. Each\r\nvoyager had a Rob Roy canoe, slightly improved as to model and built\r\nupon the incomparable plan of Mr. Rushton of Canton, New York. The\r\ncanoes are fourteen feet long, ten and a half inches deep and\r\ntwenty-seven inches wide, decked over except a man-hole sixteen by about\r\nthirty-six inches, and weighing, with the mast and lug sail, from fifty\r\nto fifty-six pounds. The paddle is eight feet long, bladed at each end,\r\ngrasped in the middle, and drives the canoe by strokes alternating on\r\neach side. The traveller sits flat upon the boat's floor, facing the\r\nbow. The canoe is not only a vehicle, but furnishes a dry and secure bed\r\nfor sleeping at night, and, with its rubber apron, is a refuge from rain\r\nand storm. Each boat was equipped with an air-pillow, rubber blanket,\r\nrubber poncho, woollen blankets, rubber navy-bag and haversack. The\r\ngeneral outfit represented a fine double shot-gun, a small and effective\r\nrifle, a revolver, fishing-tackle for each man, compass, aneroid\r\nbarometer, thermometer, folding stove, stew-pans in nests, frying-pan,\r\nbroiler, table-ware, and provisions for three weeks based upon the army\r\nration, with dried fruits, condensed milk, brandy, medicines, etc.,\r\npurchased at St. Paul.\r\n\r\nOur stores and equipment suitably divided between the canoes, we paddled\r\nup through the outlet and into the lake, followed by Metagooe and\r\nWaisonbekton in a large birch-bark canoe bearing the provisions and\r\ncamp-supplies of the Indians, while their companions walked across the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nWild Rice Lake is about one mile by five miles in extent. It is named\r\nfrom the wild rice which grows up from its shallow depths over almost\r\nits whole extent. Each autumn hundreds of Indians gather upon its shores\r\nin tents and lodges to secure the crop. Two squaws pass slowly through\r\nthe thick rice in a birch canoe, one paddling at the stern and the other\r\nat the bow, drawing the ripe rice over the gunwale and with a club\r\nflailing the grain out of the straw into the boat. There and thus every\r\nfamily upon the reservation may secure an important part of the winter's\r\nprovisions.\r\n\r\nThrough and over this green and productive sea we paddled about four\r\nmiles to the mouth of Wild Rice River, which flows out of Upper Wild\r\nRice Lake, then up the narrow, deep and crooked river. At our noon\r\nrendezvous Kawaybawgo and his foot-companions came in with a fine deer,\r\nthe victim of his old but effective gun. In the early afternoon our\r\nprogress became slow and excessively wearying from the shallowing of the\r\nriver and its wonderful crookedness. The current ran like a mill-race\r\naround hundreds of short turns, and had its own exasperating way upon\r\nour keels. Finally, we were obliged to wade and drag the canoes after us\r\nin water varying between ankle-and waist-deep. A few hours of this wore\r\nus all out, and we called a halt and camp, utterly exhausted, with not\r\nmore than twelve miles to the credit of the hard day's work. The Betsy\r\nD.'s skipper rolled over dead-beaten and sick; the Hattie's captain\r\nfloundered up into the deep grass, incapable of further effort; while he\r\nof the Kleiner Fritz, scarcely better off, prescribed camphor and black\r\ncoffee for the one and cherry brandy for the other, discreetly mixing\r\nthe prescription for himself. Medication, an hour's rest and juicy\r\nrashers of broiled venison from the Indians' generous store soon brought\r\nthe expedition to its wonted cheer and vigor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TAKING WATER, WILD RICE LAKE.]\r\n\r\nSupper over, we filled the pipes of the Indians with fine tobacco and\r\nasked for a council. We all sat around a bright fire, and soon effected\r\na bargain with the Indians to drag our canoes on up the little river,\r\nleaving us to walk across the country with the guide. Early the\r\nfollowing morning we started, four of our party with the canoes, and we\r\non foot with Kewashawkonce. The guide was pantomimed by our fat man for\r\na conservative pace becoming the hot morning and the difficult route.\r\nKe, as we abbreviated him, strode into an unbroken forest, grown with\r\ndense underbrush, strewn with fallen trees at almost every step,\r\ndiversified by swamps and thickets through which he beat his way by main\r\nstrength, and now and then traversed by rivers--all streams are rivers\r\nthere--into which he plunged with never an interrogation-mark, and so on\r\nbriskly, up hill and down, till, with three miles of walking, wading,\r\nclimbing and struggling, we were brought to bay, tired out. Half an\r\nhour's rest and some refreshing wild strawberries prepared us for such\r\nanother stage. Then an hour more of this terrible strain made us drop\r\nagain for rest. Another hour, and before noon, hot and jaded, we came\r\nout upon a low bluff overhanging the river, and stopped for lunch. The\r\nguide, apparently fresh and unwearied, cut a sheet of birch bark for\r\ntinder, lit a fire as defence against mosquitos, and in sixty seconds\r\nwas snoring. We were not slow in following his example, and the sun was\r\ndropping over into the west when we awoke. The guide examined the river,\r\nand informed us that our wading section was yet below. Standing in\r\nmid-stream drinking from his hands, he saw a fine pickerel's graceful\r\nmovements a rod away, reached out for a half-sunken bit of a tree's\r\nbranch, plunged it dexterously at the fish, struck it fairly in the\r\nback, and brought it up to us with a satisfied grunt. We lounged the\r\nafternoon away, and at six o'clock Metagooe came wearily to our camp\r\nwith the Fritz at his heels. Half an hour later his comrades came with\r\nthe other Rob Roys, their camp-traps loaded upon the decks and upon the\r\ninterpreter's back. Our inquiry as to what had become of their birch\r\ncanoe brought from Henry, as he dropped his pack, the sententious\r\nanswer, \"Busted.\" Over the evening's pipes and camp-fire, less than\r\neight miles of actual distance accomplished, we resolved to abandon the\r\nshallow river and to portage directly to Upper Wild Rice Lake. The\r\nskipper of the Betsy proposed for the three of us a joint bed:\r\nCincinnati feet have a troublesome time under a Rob Roy's low deck. We\r\nassented, stretched our rubber blankets, spread our woollens, adjusted\r\nthe Betsy's long mosquito-bar and crawled carefully under it in\r\nexpectation of a glorious sleep under the stars and the pines; but the\r\ndreams of the Hattie's captain, the trombonings of the Betsy's nose, the\r\ntossings of the Fritz and the savage industry of the mosquitos drove\r\nanything but troubled sleep from our eyelids, and we welcomed the early\r\n\"Ho! ho! ho!\" and improvised gong of the irrepressible Kawaybawgo.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MINNESOTA MOSQUITOS.]\r\n\r\nBefore we had done with our coffee, venison and slap-jacks the Indians\r\nhad made yokes for carrying the canoes on their heads and shoulders, and\r\nhad reduced the camp to packs. Soon we were off upon the first _pose_ of\r\na regular Indian portage. Each of three Indians had upon his shoulders\r\none of the canoes, his head within its hot and darkening sides, its bow\r\npointing forward high in the air and its stern hanging low behind his\r\nheels. The other two squatted upon heel and toe, drew the broad strap of\r\ntheir carrying-thongs over their foreheads, and with a plunge and a\r\ngrunt sprang to their feet, each with a great hump of six score pounds.\r\nThen we plunged, in Indian file, into a trackless forest, and jogtrotted\r\nour way for three miles, when in a clump of pines, without a word or a\r\nsignal, down came the boats and the packs. Three of the splendid fellows\r\nloosed their pack-thongs and took their rest in tramping back unloaded\r\nto camp for what had been left. The others, with us, rested a few\r\nmoments: then we pushed on till two miles brought us out upon the low,\r\njungled shore of a beautiful lake about one mile by two in extent. The\r\nguide, without a word, laid down his load, but not his clothes, and with\r\na swift rush sprang far out into the lake, swam up and down, splashing,\r\nshouting and laughing, came dripping to shore, lit his smudge-fire, lay\r\ndown in a sunny place, snored an hour, awoke dry and vigorous, and with\r\na whoop he and Waisonbekton dashed into the woods to go back for their\r\nshare of the luggage left behind. While they were gone we enjoyed our\r\nlunch and gave a name to the lovely lake which had rippled so long, far\r\naway from the haunts of men, without identity. We christened it Rob Roy\r\nLake, in honor of our fleet. It lies half a mile to the south-west of\r\nUpper Wild Rice Lake, into which its waters flow, and is set down on\r\nColton's sectional map in the township range numbered thirty-seven. Our\r\nentire party reunited, we canoeists paddled across to the lake's outlet,\r\na narrow, miry stream which loses itself in a swamp, and that in turn\r\nmerges into the Upper Wild Rice Lake. We paddled and poled down to the\r\nend of the little river, and came to a dead stand in the matted roots of\r\nthe swamp-grass: then waded waist-deep in the mire and slime, each\r\ndragging his canoe with the aid of an Indian, until we came out upon the\r\nopen water. Thence a paddle of two miles along the coast brought us to\r\nanother little stream flowing into the lake. As we came to its mouth\r\nKawaybawgo was feasting upon a duck he had killed and broiled, of which\r\nhe offered me a portion with a smile and interrogative grunt which\r\nseemed to compassionate my wet, weary and forlorn appearance. A splendid\r\npike, two feet long, came gracefully out of the stream and hung\r\nmotionless in the clear water. I pointed him out to the Indian and the\r\nHattie's captain, both of whom were standing near him. At the instant\r\ntheir eyes fell upon him he moved: then, as they started for him, he\r\ndarted like a flash for deep water, pursued by the two men at the top of\r\ntheir speed through a sheet of water six inches deep for nearly a\r\nhundred feet out. It was a fair race, and the six-feet-three Indian made\r\na splendid spurt, but the pike won.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MISSISSIPPI AT LAST!]\r\n\r\nThe stream bore us upward to the floating bog out of which it flowed. We\r\ndrew the canoes out upon a meadow which undulated in graceful billows at\r\nour every movement. A step would shake all the surface for a rod about\r\nus, while our combined tread sent waves of grassy earth in every\r\ndirection. A sudden leap so shook the cup of cold coffee sitting by one\r\nof the Indians, six or seven yards away, that the liquid spilled over\r\nthe cup's edge. The whole meadow, solid to the eye, is but one of those\r\nmonster sponges that hold in abeyance waters which otherwise would sweep\r\nlike a flood down the great rivers. Beyond this billowy field we came to\r\nthe open water of another unnamed lake, about one mile long, fringed\r\nabout with green pines, to which we gave the name of Longworth, in honor\r\nof Cincinnati's distinguished judge, and to a lovely little green island\r\nthickly grown with trees we gave the name of another canoeist left\r\nbehind, Mr. Empson of Louisville. At the head of Longworth Lake, and in\r\nplain view of Empson Island, within a space cleared out of a dense\r\njungle, we made our last camp before reaching the coveted Mississippi.\r\nOur stay here was marked in red by the most vindictive attack from\r\nmosquitos in all the cruise. No one unacquainted with the Northern\r\nMinnesota wilderness in midsummer, or with a region having a similar\r\ninsect population, can at all imagine the number and fierceness of the\r\nravenous aerial hosts that had beset us all the way from White Earth. In\r\nmid-day they keep one constantly alert, while at night they are beyond\r\ncredible report. They are small, shrewd and persistent. As I lay awake\r\ntheir myriad voices about and above me made a great chorus, really grand\r\nand impressive, out of which for a few seconds at a time there came\r\nbursts of harmony which I could hardly separate from the idea of a\r\nvast, distant chorus of human voices. Against their voracity no ordinary\r\nbar is a bar at all. We had gone to their haunts provided with netting\r\nwhich at home gave immunity, but through its meshes these mosquitos\r\ninserted their bills, then their heads, then struggled through bodily,\r\nand came down upon us like demons. We were dressed in woollens, our\r\nhands were in dogskin gloves and our heads and necks in thick calico\r\nhoods and capes, but all such protections were naught when those\r\nscreaming villains had a mind for blood. At one onslaught they would go\r\ninto the shrinking flesh through two thicknesses of wool and two of\r\ncotton, or through a heavy dogskin glove, or through the thick and\r\nhardened skin of the hand's palm or the foot's ball, or through a\r\nbuckskin moccasin and cotton hose--through any protection at our command\r\nexcept a cotton canopy hung wide of our heads and bodies.\r\n\r\nSung and stung out of all endurance by the very centre of that army of\r\nthe wilderness, we were astir in the grayest of our second Thursday's\r\ndawn, and were soon in readiness for our final portage over the crests\r\nof the Heights of Land to the river, which out of our long and severe\r\nmarch had become to us a veritable Mecca. Our way was up a gentle range\r\nof hills, whose tops, but a few yards wide, divide the waters which flow\r\nsouthward to the great Gulf from those which seek their far northward\r\ntrend through the Red River of the North. The first division of our\r\nparty reached the Mississippi before noon with a joy born out of a\r\nweek's toil and hardship, and in a trice I was drinking of and laving in\r\nits swift, bright water. We could hardly realize that in this deep,\r\nrushing brook, not more than four or five paces wide, we saw the\r\nbeginnings of that majestic current which drains half a continent. Soon\r\nour second division came up, we ate our last lunch in company, and the\r\nIndians, each shaking us by the hand with a grunt and a smile, then\r\ngoing off into the forest with a cheer, left us alone in that vast and\r\nuninhabited wilderness. Late in the afternoon we launched our canoes\r\ninto the little river, and loaded them for our journey to its head,\r\ncamping about three miles above our point of embarkation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEAD OF THE MISSISSIPPI.]\r\n\r\nThe next morning we started with light hearts upon what we supposed\r\nwould be but a short journey to the river's source, to meet an\r\nexasperating disappointment. We had made a bargain for transportation\r\nfrom the railway to Itasca Lake or to a point five miles below, all\r\nfully diagrammed and understood by correspondence, but found ourselves\r\nset down by the employes of the rascally half-breed--who had been\r\ncareful to leave us at Wild Rice Lake--in an unknown land, six days from\r\ncivilization, at a point nearly or quite thirty miles below the lake,\r\nbelow a region of rapids and obstructions against which we had\r\nespecially stipulated, and up which no craft had ever travelled. A\r\nmile's work brought us to the beginning of this second series of\r\ntroubles. Lying across the river at all heights, depths and angles were\r\nthe tough pine logs we had dreaded, and at every mile or two were\r\ntumbling rapids. All that long Friday we took our turns with the axe,\r\nlopping off branches that we might squeeze under or shunt over logs;\r\nclimbing with our stores and boats over great log-drifts held by the\r\ngrip of the rocky defiles; wading through shoals and dragging our canoes\r\nthrough mud and sand; plunging suddenly into holes that engulfed us to\r\nour armpits; paddling astride our decks over pools too deep for wading;\r\nchopping and wrenching logs that forbade other means of passage;\r\nfighting inch by inch up plunging gorges, down which and over whose\r\nrugged boulders the narrowed waters foamed in almost resistless fury and\r\nmilky foam--on and up, rod by rod, half a mile in the hour, till we came\r\nto a weary and desolate camp not two leagues from our breakfasts. There\r\nwe cooked our suppers and ate in hoods and gloves, fighting mosquitos\r\nand black flies for every morsel, speculating as to the morrow's\r\nprobabilities and discussing the question of victory or defeat. We rose\r\nfrom the night's sleep resolved upon seeing Itasca, and until\r\nmid-afternoon fought over again the battles of yesterday, and at last\r\ncame out upon a smooth, placid stream, up which we paddled with easy\r\nswing some nine miles. Then the river narrowed and shallowed, and we\r\nagain took to our feet upon a beautiful gravelly bottom. At times the\r\nway was closed to sight by rushes and wild rice, and we could only beat\r\nour way through. At last the water, thickly grown with reeds, broadened\r\nand deepened, and a score of paddle-strokes carried us through the green\r\ncurtain out upon Itasca's beautiful surface, over which we glided, under\r\nthe shadows of the setting sun, up to Schoolcraft's Island for a\r\nSunday's quiet.\r\n\r\nOur heavy and restful sleep was not broken till long after the sun was\r\nglinting upon us through the trees. Our first work was given to building\r\na lodge of underbrush and making preparations for two days' stay on the\r\nlonely island, completed by unfurling the signal of the New York Canoe\r\nClub from a high stump hard by the camp-fire. Barring the mosquitos,\r\nSunday's rest was a pleasant and refreshing sequence to ten days of toil\r\nand struggle, and Monday found us in hearty readiness for a thorough\r\nexploration of Itasca Lake and its feeders. We took a lunch, our guns\r\nand scientific instruments, and paddled up the south-west arm of the\r\nlake to find and explore the leading tributary. We found the outlets of\r\nfive small streams, two having well-defined mouths and three filtering\r\ninto the lake through bogs. Selecting the larger of the two open\r\nstreams, we paddled into its sluggish waters, ten feet wide and one foot\r\ndeep where they enter the lake. Slow and sinuous progress of two hundred\r\nyards brought us to a blockade of logs and to shallow water. We landed,\r\nfastened the canoes, took our bearings by compass and started for a\r\ntramp through thicket and forest to Elk Lake, which we reached after a\r\nrapid walk of thirty-five minutes. This lake is an oval of about one\r\nmile in its longest diameter. It lies about half a mile in a straight\r\nline south from Itasca. Its shores are marshy, bordered by hills densely\r\ntimbered. Its sources are boggy streams having little or no\r\nclearly-defined course. To all appearance, these bogs and this small\r\nlake are the uttermost tributaries to Itasca Lake, and the latter,\r\nconcentrating these minor streams and sending them out as one, is the\r\ntrue head of the Father of Waters.\r\n\r\nElk Lake was a place of misadventure to us. Our struggle through the\r\nthicket and dense forest was hot and exhausting. Our scientist left\r\nthere a fine aneroid barometer, which a second hot walk failed to\r\nrecover. Our photographer, arrived at the lake with a grievous burden of\r\ncamera, plates, tripod, etc., found that he had forgotten his lens\r\ntubes, and was compelled to double his tracks back to the canoes, then\r\nwade out into the swampy borders of the lake, waist-deep in slime, to\r\nsecure a view of this highest Mississippi water, only to have his plate\r\nlight-struck and ruined by an accident on the homeward journey.\r\n\r\nWhile the artist was gone for his forgotten lenses our Nimrod missed a\r\nfine eagle which swept over our heads at long range. So we returned to\r\nour island camp in no very good mood, but a successful troll for\r\nlake-trout, and a good supper off two fine fellows baked under the coals\r\nin birch jackets, sent us to bed in good spirits and with no regrets\r\nsave for the lost barometer.\r\n\r\n  A.H. SIEGFRIED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNATIONAL MUSIC AN INTERPRETER OF NATIONAL CHARACTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe popular music of any people is, in a great measure, the thermometer\r\nof its physical sensitiveness and its moral sentiments; and the reason\r\nof this is evident. The shepherd tending his flock, the fisherman\r\nmending his nets, the soldier on the march, the peasant at the plough,\r\nhas no inducement to sing unless his heart's emotion incite him to it. A\r\ntrue national music is, then, what the Germans call _Volksmusik_, and,\r\nspringing from the hearts of the people, it is psychologically one of\r\ntheir best interpreters. For this reason the composers of national\r\nmelodies are seldom known to fame. A national song composes itself: the\r\nmusician's lyre is the musician's heart, and from the sorrow, triumph\r\nand travail of life comes the child of song.\r\n\r\nThe assertion, then, that music is a universal language is only half\r\ntrue: it has a great variety of dialects; and it is this very\r\nsensitiveness to human influence which makes it so universally eloquent.\r\nLet us turn first to the East, for it still retains its primitive music,\r\nand at this very hour some muezzin is calling from his minaret or some\r\nJew intoning his Talmud in the same musical cadence with which Syrian\r\nmaidens sang the hymns to Cybele.\r\n\r\nAll Oriental music is distinguished by a pathetic, long--drawn, wailing\r\nmonotony quite in keeping with the stationary and contemplative\r\ncharacter of the people. We are struck at once with its frequent\r\nrepetitions of one note and its short and cautious transitions, the\r\nintervals rarely being greater than a half, or at most a full, note. The\r\nconclusion of a measure is generally a descent, and the commencement of\r\na new one seems to be a feeble effort to rise from the dreamy apathy in\r\nwhich Eastern imagination delights; but it is immediately followed by\r\nthe fall of the rhythmus, re-establishing its languid repose. The\r\nfrequent use of half notes induces a predominance of the minor key, and\r\nthis, with the constant recurrence of the rhythmical fall, imparts to\r\nSemitic and Hindoo music that melancholy, lethargic uniformity which\r\nexpresses in a striking manner the benumbed energies and undeveloped\r\nspirit of the people among whom it is found. When a race has substituted\r\nhabit and custom for national feeling, its music is necessarily\r\nmonotonous and characterless, for the stronger the national feeling of\r\nany people, the more intense, vivid and pronounced will be its music.\r\n\r\nHindoo music is almost untranslatable to Western ears, but Sir W. Jones,\r\nin an essay on the musical modes of the Hindoos--to be found in the\r\nthird volume of the _Asiatic Researches_--makes an attempt to render one\r\nof their most popular songs. The original, of which he also gives a\r\ncopy, looks like a mixture of Egyptian hieroglyphics and Chinese\r\ncharacters, and how far our notation represents it it is impossible to\r\nsay; for, though Sir W. Jones was an erudite Oriental scholar, that of\r\nitself would not render him a good translator of Hindoo music. The air\r\nis a song of love and spring, and the measure is indicated, \"rapid and\r\ngay:\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MUSIC.]\r\n\r\nKindred to Semitic and Hindoo music, though venturing on bolder\r\nintervals, is Chinese, Persian and Arabian. The almost untranslatable\r\nairs of India assume in China something like an artless melody. Their\r\nsmallest intervals are semitones, which have been in use, like\r\neverything else in China, from time immemorial. Nevertheless, in the\r\ndiatonic series of seven intervals the Chinese usually avoid the two\r\nsemitones by omitting the fourth and the seventh, so that their scale\r\nconsists really of only five intervals, and as they regard F as their\r\nprincipal key (just as we regard C as ours), the Chinese scale stands\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHINESE SCALE.]\r\n\r\nThis scale is, however, by no means confined to China, but is met with\r\nin several Asiatic countries--Japan, Siam, Java, etc. In order to judge\r\nhow it affects the character of music, I have copied the following\r\nChinese air and Japanese song from Carl Engel's _Researches into Popular\r\nSongs and Customs_:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHINESE AIR, \"MOO-LEK-WHA.\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAPANESE AIR.]\r\n\r\nArabic music, which is Asiatic in its foundation, shows decided traces\r\nof the wider civilization and greater independence of character to which\r\nthis race attained. The delicate gradations of sounds are still adhered\r\nto in the form of multitudes of grace-notes, but the intervals are\r\nlonger and the melodies more decided. The overloading of the melody by\r\nan excessive use of trills and grace-notes by Persians, Arabians, and\r\neven Spaniards, in their popular music, indicates some common sentiment;\r\nand it is remarkable that the European Jews preserve this same Oriental\r\nornamentation in the vocal performances of their synagogues. Numerous\r\nexamples of Arabic music may be found in Lane's _Modern Egypt_. This\r\nwriter professes great admiration for it, and says he \"never heard the\r\nsong of the Mekka water-carriers without emotion,\" though it consists of\r\nonly three notes:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MUSIC.]\r\n\r\nThe translation of the line is, \"Paradise and forgiveness be the lot of\r\nhim who gave you this water!\" It is said that the Arabic music is a\r\npowerful exponent of the wild, fierce and yet romantic nature of that\r\npeople, though it did not commend itself to Engel and other musicians at\r\nthe Paris Exposition. But, however void of beauty and expression any\r\nnational music is to us, it is certainly felt to possess these qualities\r\nby the people to whom it belongs; and it is very likely that our music\r\nwould seem to them just as unintelligible and discordant. When the\r\nFrench missionary Amiot played some of Boildieu's and Rossini's melodies\r\nto a Chinese mandarin he said, with a polite shake of the head, \"They\r\nare sadly devoid of meaning and expression, while the Chinese music\r\npenetrates the soul.\"\r\n\r\nBoth Venice and Spain show traces of Arabic influence in their national\r\nmusic. In Venetian airs it is only a dim memory, manifesting itself by\r\nthe frequent repetition of single notes, whereas the Spanish melodies\r\nare often so Moorish in construction and sentiment that it is easy to\r\nfancy in them tones like the call of the muezzin. Thus, too, the\r\nfollowing Spanish song, judged by its repetitions and short intervals,\r\nmight easily be taken for an Arabic air:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MUSIC.]\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that instruments of percussion are the natural\r\nexponents of such primitive music, and that, therefore, the East has its\r\ndrum, gong and cymbals, Arabia its tambourine, Spain its castanets.\r\n\r\nThe Sclavs, being a pure race, have also a very decided national music.\r\nIts peculiarity is smooth, lisping, sibillating sounds, analogous to the\r\nrustling of leaves in a forest. Having no native accent in their own\r\nlanguage, they easily imitate that of others; and this imparts to the\r\nSclavonic races that admirable facility for speaking foreign languages\r\nwhich distinguishes them. This characteristic of their speech is\r\nfaithfully reproduced in their music, especially in that of the southern\r\nSclavs. It is indicated by continuous notes of the same value, and by a\r\ncompass scarcely ever exceeding a fifth. Its negative peculiarities\r\nharmonize exactly with the history of the Russians. The sad, doleful\r\nmonotony of their existence in the past is pathetically interpreted by\r\ntheir narrow, sombre, subdued melodies. They are the voice of a people\r\nwhose ideas revolved in a narrow circle--of people who dwelt on vast\r\ngray plains dotted with sad brown huts, and who heard no sounds but the\r\nsighing of the wind through the dark pine forests. The \"Vesper Hymn,\"\r\nknown to every ordinary player, is a very good example of the general\r\ncharacter of Russian melodies. The songs of the peasants are further\r\ndistinguished by their frequent modulation from the major to the minor\r\nkey, as if not long could they be joyful, and also by the peculiar way\r\nin which they are rendered. The tonic and the dominant are the prevalent\r\nintervals, and the intermediate notes are slurred or slightly sounded.\r\nRochlitz found it impossible to convey this peculiarity by notation, but\r\ngives the following melody as a favorite accompaniment to the serf-songs\r\nof Northern Russia:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MUSIC.]\r\n\r\nThe Poles, members of this family, have had a great national existence,\r\nand their national music echoes its history and its character. The\r\nheartstirring strains of their mazurkas make many a bosom beat and ache\r\nas they remind the listeners of past times. Polish music is the voice of\r\na light-minded, brave-hearted people who lived in a gay turmoil and\r\ndrained with eager lips and reckless spirits the cup of glory and of\r\njoy. The Polish polkas and mazurkas, with their changing and fugitive\r\nrhythmus and their lively, uneven time, admirably embody the light and\r\ngraceful spirit of this people.\r\n\r\nIn striking contrast to the character and music of the Slavic peoples\r\nare the character and music of the Hungarians. Living on the confines of\r\nthe East and West, this people belong to the former by descent and to\r\nthe latter by civilization. Between two elements, they have been exposed\r\nto the attacks of both, and their history records only a continual\r\nstruggle for existence as a nation. This prolonged warfare has made\r\n_nationality_ the uppermost thought in the life of the Hungarian: it is\r\nthe influence controlling all his ideas, his feelings, his poetry and\r\nhis art. His music embalms a thousand years of struggle for it, and\r\nevery note of its wild, melancholy strains breathes tales of war and\r\nsorrow, of hope and triumph. The music interpreting such an intense\r\nnationality ought to be a peculiar one; and it is. A foreigner, having\r\nonce heard it, can never mistake its sounds for those of any other\r\nnational music.\r\n\r\nBut to understand the Magyar music you must apprehend the Magyar's\r\ncharacter. He is a singular mixture of East and West, habitually passive\r\nand melancholy, yet easily roused to the wildest excitement. His step is\r\nslow, his face pensive, his manners imposing and dignified; yet when\r\nonce roused he rushes forward with a furious impetuosity which his\r\nenemies have learned to estimate and dread. His eloquence is wonderful,\r\nand after success he throws aside his solemnity and gives himself up\r\nwith wild abandon to the feast, the dance and the song. All this various\r\ncharacter he has imparted to his national music: it is full of pathos\r\nand earnestness, yet often impetuous and even hilarious. The \"Rakotzy\"\r\nis so perfectly national that it thrills like a shout from the Hungarian\r\nheart, and it is no wonder that the Austrian government found it\r\nnecessary to forbid it to be played on public occasions, and even to\r\nconfiscate all printed copies of it. \"When I hear the 'Rakotzy,'\" said a\r\nfamous Hungarian, \"I feel as if I must arise and conquer the world.\" As\r\nmy readers can easily procure a copy of it, it would be a kind of\r\nsacrilege to give so grand a march shorn of any of its noble\r\nproportions; and I can with far more justice give an example which\r\nembraces two of the most predominant traits of Hungarian songs--the\r\nScotch _catch_ introduced in the middle or end of the bar, instead of at\r\nthe beginning as in Scotch music, and the beautiful modulations from the\r\nmajor to the minor key of the minor third--a change very unusual in any\r\nnational music but the Hungarian:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HUNGARIAN AIR.]\r\n\r\nWe cannot leave Hungarian music without noticing the fact that it has\r\nbeen greatly influenced by the gypsies of that country, by whom it is\r\nmainly cultivated as an art. In Hungary, indeed, there is no stately\r\nfestival, no public rejoicing, no private merrymaking, without some\r\ngypsy band; and it would be impossible to find more sympathetic\r\ninterpreters of its intense and passionate spirit. But if professional\r\nmusicians, they are nomadic ones: they wander through all the towns and\r\nvillages of Transylvania and Wallachia, and are everywhere welcome. In\r\ndance-music the life and impetuosity of their musical movements, their\r\nvarying rhythms and the strange thrill of their wild dissonances are\r\nabsolutely enthralling. Charles Boner, in his work on Transylvania, says\r\nthat even the aged find it impossible to resist the dance when a gypsy\r\nband invites them to it. Their prelude is slow and sonorous, the music\r\nquickens, there is a rush of tones, the fantastic melody hastens on at a\r\nhead-long pace--every one, old and young, is under its spell.\r\n\r\nMany of the Hungarian gypsies are composers as well as performers.\r\nPougratz and Patikarus are names beloved wherever the \"Czardas\" is\r\nlistened to; and where, in Hungary, is not the \"Czardas\" listened to? No\r\none can play a \"Czardas\" like a gypsy, and he is often rewarded for it\r\nin the most exaggerated manner; for he soon has his audience so excited\r\nthat they call for it again and again, and heap recompense on\r\nrecompense, until, in their passionate delight, the last ducat, the last\r\nwatch, ring, and even horse, has been bestowed. The gypsies of Hungary\r\nconclude all pieces ending in the minor key by substituting the major\r\nchord for the minor chord; for instance, a passage written thus,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MUSIC.]\r\n\r\nthey finish thus:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MUSIC.]\r\n\r\nfollowing instinctively a rule which we find frequently observed in the\r\nmost classical compositions. The following is a martial dance of the\r\ngypsies, but the most elaborate notation would only be the skeleton of\r\nany example: the best parts of all their performances are those they\r\nimprovise while playing:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MUSIC.]\r\n\r\nIt may be said that the gypsy has no nationality, and can therefore have\r\nno national music. This is hardly true. The gypsy has no country, but\r\nhis sentiment of nationality is strong and persistent, and his music is\r\nas peculiar as his language and customs. It is true that he steals the\r\nmusic of the country in which he sojourns just as readily as he steals\r\nthe poultry from the roost or the linen from the line, but he always\r\nimparts to it some echo of his far Eastern home and some flavor of the\r\ntent and the hedgerow. Twice in my life this fact has struck me in a\r\nremarkable manner. Once, on the skirts of a pine forest in the wilds of\r\nArgyleshire, I came suddenly on a gypsy-camp celebrating a wedding. The\r\nwomen were dancing the \"Romalis\" to a violin and tambourine. The music,\r\nthe dance, the conical tents, the flashing swarthy faces, the careless\r\npiquant dresses, were all so Oriental in character that in spite of the\r\nmountains, the moors and the heather I found it hard to realize that I\r\nwas in the heart of Scotland. Even when the most distinctive Scotch\r\npibrochs were played I was quite conscious of an Eastern clash in them\r\nwhich no Scot could or would have given. Again: eighteen months ago I\r\nfound a camp of English gypsies in the Rocky Mountains a little beyond\r\nGolden. One man was leaning against a tree fiddling negro melodies to\r\nthe birds, but negro melodies with the flavor of the tent instead of the\r\ncabin. At my request he played \"Yankee Doodle,\" and imparted to it a\r\nrevolutionary dash, a piquant mocking defiance, which convinced me that\r\nhe knew its history and was interpreting it from his own heart--a fact\r\nwhich a subsequent conversation confirmed. I often wonder that no\r\nmusical speculator has ever organized a band of Russian, Hungarian and\r\nEnglish gypsies. Certainly, it would give us a far more characteristic\r\nentertainment than bands of blackened \"minstrels.\"\r\n\r\nThe Swiss love their national music as they love their mountains and\r\ntheir freedom; and at first sight it seems singular that a people so\r\nblended with the progress of liberty should possess a music singularly\r\nsimple and pastoral. But in this fact we perceive how truly music\r\nexplains character, for as early as the fourteenth century their\r\npolitical faith, like their mode of life, was simple and averse to\r\ndisplay. In a few ordinary words the deputies of Appenzell said all that\r\nhas since been said with infinite bombast: \"We are convinced that\r\nmankind are born for order, but not for servitude--that they must have\r\nmagistrates whom they themselves elect, but not masters to grovel\r\nunder.\" The essentials of true freedom having thus early become an\r\nevery-day enjoyment, a people so plain and simple sang naturally\r\nmelodies suggestive of the calm pastoral life so dear to them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SWISS SONG.]\r\n\r\nWe must notice that the favorite instrument of the Swiss, the Alp-horn,\r\nhas caused a predilection for a certain progression of intervals. The\r\nAlp-horn is a long tube of fir-wood having the same compass as the\r\ntrumpet. But on both these instruments the upper F is not an exact F,\r\nneither is it an exact F sharp, and thus in most Alpine tunes there are\r\npassages like the following, where the notes marked x ought to be F\r\nnatural, but are nearly F sharp. However, this irregular tone charms the\r\nSwiss, and is one of the peculiarities of their \"Ranz des Vaches:\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MUSIC.]\r\n\r\nBut it is in the national music of the Celtic race that we find the most\r\nfamiliar examples of melody symbolizing character. The purest form of it\r\nis undoubtedly the Irish; and who will not bear witness that in its\r\nhalf-laughing and half-sobbing notes we hear the voice of the race? Its\r\nmusical distinction is the emphatic and striking introduction of the\r\nsixth major, but this peculiarity is also prominent in Scotch and Welsh\r\nairs, and is a favorite termination in all mountainous countries. To a\r\nfine sensibility there is, I think, a much more peculiar trait in Irish\r\nmusic, whether gay or sad--a strain of _longing_ which imparts a charm\r\nlike songs of memory--a strain so subtle that my explanation can only be\r\nintelligible to those who have already apprehended it.\r\n\r\nKindred to the Irish is the Welsh and the Scotch music. The Welsh has a\r\nmore hopeless sob, the Scotch a wilder mirth. We feel in the old Welsh\r\ntunes that terrible struggle they had, first with the Romans, and then\r\nwith the Anglo-Normans; and whoever has heard the \"March of the Men of\r\nHaerlech\" will understand why King Edward slew the Welsh Bards.\r\n\r\nThe most striking examples of Scotch music are the pibrochs and\r\nstrathspeys. These compositions generally ring with a wild laughter that\r\nis almost harassing, especially when it is enhanced by the abrupt close\r\nwith the fifth instead of the keynote. The ear, which has been longing\r\nfor the rest, has a sense of being teased and deluded with the\r\nrollicking strain. As exponents of the cautious, cannie Scot we should\r\nthink them a satire did we not know what a wild vein of Celtic wit runs\r\nthrough the granite foundation of his character. If it be true that\r\nnational musics embalm peculiar humanities, of no country is this so\r\ntrue as of Scotland, for no people and no history is so highly\r\npicturesque and so full of the broadest lights and shadows. In their\r\nearliest history we find this antithesis. They lived rudely as peasants:\r\nthey fought as if possessed by the very spirit of chivalry. When they\r\nabolished the magnificence of the papacy they inaugurated the barest of\r\nchurches. They were the first to betray Charles Stuart, and the last to\r\nlay down arms for the rights of his descendants. They are worldly-wise\r\nto a proverb, and yet wildly susceptible to poetry and romance.\r\n\r\nThe songs of such a people have necessarily a great variety: the color\r\nand the perfume of life are in them. Listen to the mocking, railing\r\ndrollery of \"There cam' a young man,\" the sly humor of the \"Laird o'\r\nCockpen,\" or \"Hey, Johnnie Cope!\" and you may understand one side of\r\nScottish character. The Border ballads, that go lilting along to the\r\ngalloping of horses and jingling of spurs, are the interpretation of\r\nanother side. The same _active_ influence accompanies the Jacobite\r\nsongs--\"Up wi' the bonnets for bonnie Dundee!\" filled many a legion for\r\nPrince Charles--and the blood kindles yet to their fife-like and\r\ndrum-like movements. Again, the stately rhythm and march of some of the\r\noldest airs make them peculiarly suitable for patriotic songs; and Burns\r\ntook advantage of this when he adapted \"Scots wha hae\" to the air of\r\n\"Hey, Tuttie Taittie!\" for to this spirit-stirring strain Bruce and his\r\nheroes marched to the field of Bannock-burn.\r\n\r\nScotch music is a good example of the fact that the favorite musical\r\ninstruments of the different nations have undoubtedly caused some\r\nfavorite group of notes, constituting _motives_ of a peculiar rhythm,\r\nwhich are employed with evident preference. Thus, the use of the minor\r\nseventh instead of the major seventh (as in \"Wha'll be King but\r\nCharlie?\"), and the sudden modulation from the minor key to the major\r\nkey, a whole tone below, are in exact accord with the bagpipe, and are\r\nmore certain in the strathspeys, reels and dances which are universally\r\nplayed on that instrument; the intervals of which are\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MUSIC.]\r\n\r\nwith the bass of the drone emitting A, so that A minor must be regarded\r\nas the principal key of this instrument. Indeed, Macdonald, in his\r\n_Complete Tutor for the Great Highland Bagpipe_, gives the odd rule that\r\nthe \"piper is to pay no attention to the flats and sharps marked on the\r\nclef, as they are not used in pipe-music.\"\r\n\r\nIn Scotch music are also continually found motives of a rhythm in which\r\nthe first note has only one-fourth the duration of the second. This is\r\nknown as the Scotch catch or snap, and evidently originated in the\r\nstrathspeys, though it is now a distinction of many fine songs, notably\r\nso of \"Roy's Wife of Aldavalloch.\"\r\n\r\nThat these old melodies are the voice of ancient Scotland is proved by\r\nthe fact that no modern musician has been able to imitate them. Haydn\r\ntried to rearrange some of them, and failed, and Geminiani blotted\r\nquires of paper in attempting to write a second part to the \"Broom o'\r\nthe Cowdenknowes.\" No: ere we can add anything to the national music of\r\nScotland we must restore the precise national conditions of which it was\r\nthe articulate idea.\r\n\r\nEnglish music, until the days of the Tudors, was really French: England\r\nsang, as all Europe did, the songs of the Troubadours. But the \"Chanson\r\nde Roland\" and the \"Complaint of the Chatelain de Courcy\" were not\r\nEnglish strains, for a national song is a winged fact. France was the\r\nlegitimate successor of the Troubadours, and many of their oldest songs\r\nwould serve to-day as _airs de vaudeville_. The French national music\r\nhas mostly grown out of civil dissensions and party conflicts. What\r\nscenes do the \"Carillon,\" the atrocious \"Carmagnole\" and the\r\n\"Marseillaise\" bring up! The \"Carillon\" had been Marie Antoinette's\r\nfavorite tune: it pursued her from her palace to her prison, startled\r\nher on her way to her trial, and was probably the last sound she heard\r\nas she lay bound under the guillotine.\r\n\r\nWhen not breathing blood and anarchy French popular music has a\r\nwonderful range: it is gallant, mocking, elegant, or full of absolute\r\nnonsense and frivolity. In fact, French music has always been so\r\nintensely national that it would have been impossible for England to\r\nhave long borrowed it; and in the days of the Tudors we find English\r\ncharacter beginning to explain itself in those admirable tunes and\r\nballads which form a regular and successive declaration of English\r\nprinciples, with their sound piety, broad fun, perfect liberty of speech\r\nand capital eating and drinking. They have neither the wailing grief nor\r\nthe boisterous merriment of Celtic music, and they lack entirely the\r\nmonotonous tenderness of the Troubadours; but they are full of buoyant,\r\ndaring independence, and have a certain _homeliness_ which strikes in a\r\nvery powerful manner some chord in the Anglo-Saxon heart.\r\n\r\nThe cosmopolitan nature of the German speaks to all the world in his\r\nmusic. Of all national musics it is the grandest and the most developed:\r\nwe see this in the position it gives to rhythms. National musics with\r\nundeveloped rhythms are the speech of people just awakening, while\r\nmusic that has them strongly marked and regularly introduced belongs to\r\npeople of fully-matured energies. Only in the _Jodlers_ and _Landlers_\r\nof the Tyrolese, Austrian and Swiss mountains is the original Teutonic\r\niambic preserved in its purity. In all other German music every kind of\r\nrhythm is met with, no kind being predominant. For the musical language\r\nof Germany embraces not only the few octaves of passion, but the whole\r\nkeyboard of existence. It has preludes, symphonies and sonatas for every\r\nphase of life. Nothing smaller than this range would suffice to express\r\nthe multiform ideas of a people so thoughtful and cosmopolitan. And\r\nthough by this universal sympathy German music may have lost a purely\r\nnational life, it is a most sufficing compensation to have gained the\r\npower of expressing the ideas of a whole epoch.\r\n\r\nMusical taste in America is in progress of formation. We have no\r\nnational music: we have not even a decided preference for any style. We\r\nlike Beethoven and Chopin, but we also like Rossini and Donizetti and\r\ndelight in Lecocq and Sullivan. In no respect is the national pride so\r\nutterly forgotten as in music. We give to all schools a fair hearing.\r\nThe great German masters are household words: the national music of\r\nevery land is welcome. We have been learning to like Italian opera at an\r\ninsane cost; we have kindly winked at the follies of opera-bouffe;\r\nprobably nowhere in the world are the intellectual depths of a German\r\nsymphony and the passionate declamation of an Italian recitative more\r\nthoroughly appreciated. This is the natural musical exposition of our\r\ncomplex and various life. This wondrous variety, which indicates\r\npossibilities not yet revealed, pleases us without being always clear to\r\nour feelings and intellect. Still, we shall not ask, with the Frenchman,\r\n\"Sonate, que veux-tu?\" We are satisfied with what the present affords,\r\nand what new masters shall appear or what new instruments be invented we\r\nknow not. Always the epochs will have their own interpreter. One hundred\r\nyears ago who had imagined a Weber or Steinway piano, that piece of\r\nfurniture with a soul in it?\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested to me while writing this paper that national\r\nmelodies are in a great measure influenced by the physical features of\r\nthe country in which they rise. I think very little so. It is true that\r\nthe music of all mountainous countries has many points of resemblance,\r\nbut it is because the people of such countries have strong mental and\r\nmoral similitudes. Savages are not inspired by the most lovely scenery,\r\nand a collection of national airs from different parts of the world\r\nwould not reveal to us whether they were written in valleys or on\r\nmountains or by the sounding seashore.\r\n\r\nThere are distinct ensigns by which national music may be as promptly\r\ndetected as a ship by its colors. Spanish airs have in them the rapid\r\ntwinkling, so to speak, of the guitar; the mountain-melodies of\r\nSwitzerland recall the open notes of the Alp-horn; the Irish and Scotch\r\nmusics have their marks as plainly impressed upon them as the\r\nphysiognomy of the peoples is distinct, and it is nothing to the\r\npurpose to say that they have been cleverly imitated: the mark still\r\nremains a fact, and is the mysterious specialty that thrills the rich,\r\nthe poor, the soldier and the churchman, the peasant and the exile.\r\nWhatever analogy exists between a country and its music is mainly with\r\nthe inward character of the people themselves, and is generally too\r\nprofound to be theorized upon. We only know that at every step we\r\nadvance in the science of music we are deciphering what is written\r\nwithin us, not transcribing anything from without.\r\n\r\nNor as Americans are we insensible to the value of a national music. The\r\nfew airs which have any claim to represent us in this capacity have done\r\nservice that no money can estimate. During the late war wherever the\r\nrebel flag was raised it was necessary to silence \"Yankee Doodle.\" Like\r\nthe \"Marseillaise,\" it was an institution before which its enemies\r\ntrembled; and when we have produced or annexed something infinitely\r\ngrander we shall not forget the saucy, free-and-easy,\r\nmind-your-own-business melody that carried the nation cheerfully through\r\ntwo great crises.\r\n\r\n  AMELIA E. BARR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALLSTON'S YOUNGEST.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe railroad-village of Fairfield woke up one spring morning and found a\r\nclumsy blue car, with a skylight in its roof, standing on the common\r\nnear the blacksmith-shop. Horses and tongue were already removed, the\r\nformer being turned into the tavern pasture and the latter stowed in the\r\ntavern barn. A small sky-colored ladder led up to the door of this\r\nartistic heaven, which remained closed long after a crowd of loungers\r\nhad gathered around it.\r\n\r\nThe Fairfield loungers were famously lazy savages, though to the last\r\ndegree good-natured and obliging. They wore butternut overalls and\r\ncolored shirts, a few adding the picturesque touch of bright\r\nhandkerchiefs and broad straw hats: there were a few coats in various\r\nstages of rags and grease, and one or two pairs of boots, but the\r\nwearers of these put on no airs over the long ankles and sprawling toes\r\nwhich blossomed around them. The whole smoking, stoop-shouldered,\r\nill-scented throng were descendants of that Tennessee and Carolina\r\nelement which more enterprising Hoosiers deplore, because in every\r\ngeneration it repeats the ignorance and unthrift branded so many years\r\nago into the \"poor white\" of the South.\r\n\r\nThose who could read traced the legend \"Photographic Car\" on the sides\r\nof the vehicle, and with many a rude joke each bantered the other to\r\nhave his picter took for such purposes as skeerin' stock off the\r\nrailroad-track or knockin' the crows stiff. Their scuffling and haw-haws\r\nwaked the occupant of the car, who rose in his bunk and drew the curtain\r\nfrom a window. The boys saw his face and hushed. Raising the window, he\r\nscattered a bunch of handbills among them, which set them all to\r\nscrambling, and, when they had caught the bills, to struggling with\r\nlarge and small type which announced that an unrivalled photographer\r\nwould be in that vicinity in a very few days with his beautiful\r\ntravelling-car, giving everybody an opportunity of securing such\r\ntin-types and photographs as only the large cities turned out, and at\r\nthe lowest possible prices.\r\n\r\nPresently the photographer appeared at his own door and looked abroad.\r\nThe tender spring morning, though it glorified surrounding woods and\r\nrich farming-lands, could do little for this dilapidated village, which\r\nconsisted of one lane of rickety dwellings crossed at right angles by\r\nthe Peru Railroad, a stern brick building, a wooden elevator and a mill.\r\nIt was a squalid sight, though the festive season of the year and that\r\nglamourous air peculiar to Indiana brooded it. The photographer surveyed\r\nhis new field with an amused sneer, and descended the steps to go to his\r\nbreakfast at the tavern, a peak-roofed white frame set among locust\r\ntrees--the best house on the street. Before it stood that lozenge-shaped\r\nsign on a fat post which stands before all country taverns, making a\r\nvague, lonesome appeal to the traveller.\r\n\r\nThe loungers moved in groups on the station-platform, their hands in\r\ntheir pockets and their necks stretched forward, eying the stranger.\r\n\r\nOut of the blue distance on the railroad two plumes of steam rose\r\nsuddenly: then a black object stood up on the track and gave two calls\r\nat a crossing. Double-shuffles were danced on the platform, as if the\r\napproaching train charged these vagabonds with some of its own strength.\r\nIt screamed, and bore down upon this dilapidated station to stop for\r\none brief minute, change mail-sacks and gaze pityingly out of its one\r\neye at the howling crew which never failed to greet it there. People in\r\nthe cars also looked out as if glad they were not stopping, and a few\r\nwith long checks in their hats, who appeared to be travelling to the\r\nearth's ends, were envied by a girl approaching the post-office in the\r\nbrick block.\r\n\r\nShe waited near the photographic car until the train passed, her lip\r\ncurling at this blue van and the pretensions of its owner.\r\n\r\nLater she came out of the post-office by a back hall, and, darting a\r\nfierce look at Jim Croddy, who ran against her in his performance of the\r\ndouble-shuffle, took her way across the common, crushing her letters in\r\nher hand. This time she scarcely looked at the photographic van, but\r\nwith dilated eyes and set teeth pursued her path into the springing\r\nweeds. The photographer, who had returned, looked at her, however, and\r\nfound her individuality so attractive that he watched her swift step\r\nuntil it took her out of sight within the doorway of a brick residence\r\ndetached from the village by a meadow and long lawn.\r\n\r\nThe young man opened his car and prepared for business. His landlady was\r\ngoing to bring her grandchild to be photographed. A locker received his\r\nprimitive couch, and he further cleared the deck for action by stowing\r\nin the back apartment where he prepared his chemicals all remaining\r\nlitter. Jim Croddy and kindred spirits ventured to look in.\r\n\r\n\"See here, boys,\" inquired the photographer, \"couldn't one of you get me\r\na bucket of water from somewhere?\"\r\n\r\nThey would all do it. The heartiest and most obliging set of idlers in\r\nthe world, they almost fought for the pail, and two, taking it between\r\nthem, cantered to the pump in front of the post-office. The rest were\r\nfain to enter, treading each other's bare heels as they tumbled up the\r\nsteps.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you want your pictures taken?\" inquired the artist, quizzically\r\nsurveying his shaggy crowd.\r\n\r\n\"We ain't got no money,\" replied Bill Stillman, the smallest but\r\nreadiest-tongued.\r\n\r\n\"You got money, Bill,\" retorted Leonard Price, a parchment-colored wisp\r\nof nineteen who had recently become a widower.\r\n\r\n\"I got to git clo'es with it if I hev'. There's Mallston: git him to set\r\nfor _his_ picter.\"\r\n\r\nMallston was hooted for as he came across the dewy grass on feet of\r\nbrawn, shaming puny rustics by his huge physique. The photographer\r\nmentally limned him: a bushy, low-browed head and dark, reddish,\r\nfull-lipped face, bearded; muscle massed upon his arms and\r\ntatter-clothed legs; a deep, prominent chest; hands large, black,\r\npowerful; the whole man advancing with a lightness which in some\r\nbarbaric conqueror would have been called dignified grace.\r\n\r\nMallston had nothing to answer for himself. He stood folding his arms\r\nand looking in. It was said he had African blood in his veins--barely\r\nenough to stain the red of his skin, pinch up his children's hair and\r\ngive them those mournful, passionate black eyes through which the\r\ntragedy of the race always looks. But so vague, so mere a hearsay, was\r\nthis negro stain, if it existed at all, that he had married a white\r\nwife, and moved in society unchallenged by these very fastidious\r\ndescendants of Carolina and Tennessee.\r\n\r\nMallston's wife had lately added a son to his family. He had two sons\r\nbefore, also two daughters. From any standpoint it seemed an unnecessary\r\naddition when the economist considers that he had no means of support\r\nexcept his big-fingered paws, and these, though very willing, depended\r\non chance jobs and days' works given him by other men. In face of these\r\nfacts the youngest was there as well as the oldest--scarcely seven; the\r\nsecond, scarcely five; and the third and fourth, aged three and a half\r\nand two--in his rented house of one room, containing beds in opposite\r\ncorners, a table and a cooking-stove in front of the fireplace. A\r\ngenerous family and scant provision for it being the mode in Fairfield,\r\nhowever, Mallston may not have seen his desperate position, especially\r\nwith summer and harvest wages coming. Just now he was out of a job,\r\nhaving finished a ditching contract, and his black, speculative eyes\r\nlooked anxiously at the photographer.\r\n\r\n\"Come, clear now!\" exclaimed that young man with some authority to his\r\nloafers: \"I am going to have some sitters.\"\r\n\r\nThe landlady and her grandchild were already coming to take advantage of\r\nmorning sunlight and the domestic lull before dinner. With them came a\r\ncurious neighbor in ill-made, trailing calico and dejected sun-bonnet,\r\nwho walked with her hands on her hips and puckered her upper lip, with\r\nconsciousness of the loss of two front teeth, when she laughed. As they\r\nproceeded at a pace regulated by the toddling child, they encountered an\r\nold woman with no teeth at all, whose nose and chin leaned very much\r\ntoward each other: her grizzled hair curled under a still more dejected\r\nsun-bonnet, and, setting down a basket of clothes, she stood panting\r\nfrom exertion and wiping her wan face on the bonnet cape.\r\n\r\n\"I'm a-garn to hick'ry that Bill,\" she exclaimed weakly. \"I tole him to\r\ncarry me wash-water, and here he is stannin' round thish yer car! George\r\nand John's just out, too, and so's Foster. Soon's they git the'r vittles\r\nthey up and leave me to do the best I kin. Laws! who's garn to pay out\r\nmoney fer fortygraphs? If folks all had to work as hard as I do, they\r\nwouldn't have no money fer no such things, so they wouldn't. It 'ud\r\nstan' 'em in hand to be savin'.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you drive off some yer good-fer-nothin' boys and make 'em do\r\nsomethin', Mis' Stillman?\" bantered the neighbor.\r\n\r\n\"Well, they've all been a-workin',\" relented the mother. \"Bill, he's as\r\ngood a feller to work as ever was if he don't git with a lot of orn'ry\r\nboys. Hit hurts Fawt to work stiddy, so it does.--Bill, come here and\r\ntote these clo'es home fer me.\"\r\n\r\nBill came, ruddy and laughing from a scuffle, and walked off with the\r\nbasket.\r\n\r\n\"And git the wash-water and make a fire under the kittle,\" called his\r\nmother.\r\n\r\n\"I'll be apt to,\" responded Bill.\r\n\r\n\"Come along into the daguerreyan car, Mis' Stillman,\" invited the\r\nlandlady. \"You never see the inside o' one, did you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Laws! is that wher' you're garn to? I can't stop but a minute. Hit\r\nlooks mighty fine. The boys said this feller was drivin' into town last\r\nnight when meetin' broke. Who's garn to have their picter took?--You,\r\nJane?\"\r\n\r\n\"Me?\" replied the neighbor. \"Laws! no: I ain't rich.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you'll change your minds,\" drawled the landlady patronizingly, as\r\nbecame a lady of means: \"he takes 'em reel cheap.\"\r\n\r\nThe photographer met this group at his door and assisted them into the\r\ncar, from which all his earlier visitors had dispersed except Mallston.\r\n\r\nMallston stood at the steps and watched the landlady's grandchild\r\nprepared for a sitting. The rabble had begun their morning business of\r\npitching horseshoes, but his interest was held by that little child--its\r\nfresh clothes, rings of black hair and pomegranate coloring. The artist,\r\nhaving placed his camera, was in the farther room preparing his plate.\r\nWhen he came out and was in the act of closing the door he noticed\r\nMallston, and asked, \"Do you want a job?\"\r\n\r\nThe barbarian did decidedly.\r\n\r\n\"Come into the back room, then, and help me.\"\r\n\r\nMallston went striding through the car, and placed himself in an\r\nobedient attitude behind the partition.\r\n\r\n\"Laws!\" exclaimed Mrs. Stillman, standing between the camera, where the\r\nartist was burying his head under a black cloth, and the object to be\r\nphotographed, \"when we lived in Bartholomew county--'twas the year after\r\nwe moved f'm Johnson county--Foster and John they was little fellers\r\nthen, and I did want the'r picters that bad, so I did. But the'r pap he\r\n'lowed it was a waste o' money. Pore man! he was a mighty hard worker:\r\nhe'd go a mile'd to make a cent, and then he'd lose it all with bad\r\nmanagement, so he would. But I had easy times them days, with everything\r\nto my han': I spun and wove all the jeans the men-folks wore, and we\r\nmilked a dozen cows--\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you please move aside?\"\r\n\r\n\"Git out o' the way, Mis' Stillman: the man can't see through ye.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed the old woman, jerking herself from the photographer's\r\nline of vision, \"I didn't go fer to git in the way. But this ain't doin'\r\nmy washin',\" she added, moving toward the entrance. Here, on a little\r\nshelf, she found some tiles and brushes, which she took up to examine\r\nand hold before the other women, who were seated awaiting the\r\npicture-taking. \"What's these here things?\"\r\n\r\n\"Artists' materials,\" replied the photographer, removing his head from\r\nunder the black cloth, and that from the camera.--\"Now, my little man,\r\nlook straight at the hole in the box, and don't move.--That large brick\r\nhouse--keep perfectly quiet--across the field seems a good point to\r\nsketch from. Who lives there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Harbisons,\" replied the landlady.\r\n\r\n\"Harbisons, eh? I suppose it was Miss Harbison I saw go past this\r\nmorning?--Don't move, my little man.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do' know,\" demurred the washer-woman, whose sole recreation in life\r\nwas the faculty of speech. \"I ain't seen Mis' Harbison to town to-day.\r\nThey's him and her and the boys. Both the boys is away f'm home now.\r\nWhat-fer lookin' woman?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was a young lady in a wide hat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that's Miss Gill: she's some kin to 'em. She's a school-teacher to\r\nBunker Hill or Peru. Laws! I hate to see anybody so proud.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a good boy!\" said the photographer. He removed his plate and\r\ncarried it to the rear room, where he required the assistance of\r\nMallston, who had watched the process with silent interest. Presently\r\nreappearing with the dripping negative, which he held for the women to\r\nsee, he repeated incidentally, \"Proud, is she, this Miss Gill?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, she is, kind o',\" testified the neighbor who was called\r\nJane.--\"It's a reel good one, ain't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"If ye take as good as this all the time,\" cried the pleased landlady,\r\nholding off the negative and giving that excited drawl to the terminal\r\nword which may distinguish Kentuckians, for she claimed to be one,\r\n\"every girl in town 'll be comin' after the'r picter-uh!\"\r\n\r\n\"Except the proud Miss Gill.\"\r\n\r\nThe landlady, who had a moustache, bristled it over her square mouth: \"I\r\nnever ast much about her. She's kind o' yaller-complected, but some says\r\nshe's smart. Bill Harbison was smart too, but he's all broke up now.\r\nThey don't own nothin' but the house and grounds they're livin' in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Laws!\" poured in the steady washer-woman, \"I used to work fer Mis'\r\nHarbison when she was well off--I done knit socks and pieced quilts--and\r\nshe was always liber'l, so she was. When we fust come here he was\r\ngittin' down with his last sickness, and we left a good place in\r\nBartholomew county, fer _his_ folks they kep' a-writin', 'Here's the\r\nplace, Billy: this is wher' you'll find the flitter tree and the honey\r\npond.' And it wasn't never my will, but come we must; and you orto seen\r\nFairfield then. Why, ther' wasn't nothin' but mud, so ther' wasn't.--My\r\nsoul! if thern don't go Bill, and I know he ain't carried me no\r\nwash-water.\"\r\n\r\nThe artist helped her down the steps and asked her to come again, which\r\ncourtesy she distrusted. She 'lowed he was p'tendin'. He throwed his\r\nhead up like he was big-feelin'. It ruffled her that anybody should be\r\nbig-feelin' over a pore widder-woman that took in days' washin's, and\r\nhad a pack o' triflin' boys that et her out o' house and home.\r\n\r\nStill, this old woman enjoyed the fruit trees' budding promise as she\r\npatted along the railroad, and perhaps some old thrill shot again as a\r\nmeadow-lark uttered his short, rich madrigal from the weather-darkened\r\nfence.\r\n\r\n\"Ho, Mis' Stillman,\" called Mallston's wife, standing in her door with\r\nthe youngest on her arm, \"le's go over and see that ther' picter car.\"\r\n\r\n\"I done done it,\" responded the old woman.\r\n\r\nBy the end of two weeks this photographic car had done good execution on\r\nthe community. The artist himself appeared friendly, which greatly\r\nassisted his trade, openness to familiarity being a prime virtue in all\r\nrustic neighborhoods. Every youngster who came to the store after\r\ngroceries, with a bag slung over the horse's neck in which to carry\r\nthem, gave pap no peace until means were furnished for a rosy-cheeked\r\ntin-type of himself in a pink, green or purple case. The Appledore\r\ngirls, handsome daughters of a rich farmer, and therefore able to sit\r\nfor pictures in Kokomo, or even Indianapolis, yet put on all their\r\nchains, rings and bracelets and went to the car to test this young\r\nphotographer's skill. Mrs. Stillman received money from her daughter in\r\nEllwood, together with the written command: \"You go and git your\r\nfortygraph took fer me, mother: we don't none of us never know what's\r\na-garn to happen.\" So she removed her black alpaca from its peg on the\r\nwall for her adornment, and came also, explaining to the neighbors that\r\nKit sent the money, so she did, and was makin' a pore mouth about not\r\nhavin' no picter of mother. And having got the picture, she used all her\r\npast trials and present misfortunes to save half the price, which she\r\nsucceeded in doing.\r\n\r\nEvery day the artist had a few sitters. It was surprising how many of\r\nthe bilious, bare-legged children who collected to gaze at his framed\r\nspecimens were brought to be photographed, for most of the villagers\r\nwere squalidly poor and the farmers were entering their busy season.\r\nDuring this time he had opened the Harbison domicile to himself, being\r\nson of a friend who had sat in the State legislature with Mr. Harbison.\r\nAll Fairfield knew that he went there nearly every day, and that it was\r\nnot to shoot with the long-bow on the lawn. They had no idea how he\r\nloved to lounge from one empty room to another of this picturesque,\r\nhalf-furnished house, and how he was gratified by the fitness of the\r\ninhabitants to their abode. He liked to see Miss Gill tuck a bunch of\r\npeach-blossoms in her coil of hair, and to feel the quickening\r\ninfluences of spring supplemented by her electricity.\r\n\r\nMrs. Harbison took her earth-loving hands from garden-making and went to\r\nshow the young people the ferns in the woods. She pulled her sun-bonnet\r\nover her eyes and trod out with the solid steps of a woman bred to love\r\nthe soil under her feet. The photographer sketched along the way, but he\r\nfinally sat down by Little Wildcat where the water boiled over boulders,\r\nand Mrs. Harbison went farther to dig ginseng. There was a joyful hurry\r\nof birds all around. That leopard of the Indiana woods, the sycamore,\r\nrepeated itself in vistas.\r\n\r\n\"Sycamores always look like dazzling marble shafts blackened with\r\npatches of moss,\" said the young man.\r\n\r\n\"And their leaves,\" said the girl sitting on the log not far from him,\r\n\"smell like poetry. I spread them on my face late in summer after a\r\nshower and suck up their breath. But I never can put the sensation into\r\nwords.\"\r\n\r\n\"How's that for a sycamore?\" he asked, showing a scrap.\r\n\r\nShe examined it with great satisfaction: \"Why do you go about with a\r\nphotographic car? Why don't you set out to be an artist?\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed: \"Because there is so much of the vagabond in me, I suppose.\r\nThen I never had any education in art. Folks as poor as Job's turkey.\"\r\n\r\n\"But a man can do so much or so little.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, when I'm going about with the car I see a great many odd people,\r\nand can pick up little striking things for studies. I get a living, too,\r\nsuch as it is, which I shouldn't do if I set up as an artist. Look\r\nhere!\" He turned over his book and showed an etching of Mallston\r\nstepping across the common carrying his youngest, with the four older\r\nchildren at his heels. One had sprawled, and was evidently lifting a\r\nhowl to the paternal ear. They both laughed at it.\r\n\r\n\"He's a good fellow,\" remarked the photographer, \"but there's no end to\r\nthe ignorance and misery such creatures bring upon the world. He\r\ncouldn't take decent care of himself, and he has a wife and five\r\nchildren hanging on him.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is just so with nearly all these people,\" exclaimed Miss Gill in\r\nhigh scorn. \"They have no idea of what life should be--no ambition, and\r\nscarcely a soul to divide around among them all. It smothers me!\" She\r\nthrew her arms out impetuously. \"I want such different things--the\r\nsociety of the cultivated, the stimulus of great natures. Maybe I could\r\nwrite something that would get before the public then.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you ever sent anything East?\" he inquired with a Hoosier's vast\r\nrespect for older civilization.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she answered with a falling inflection of voice and head. \"But\r\nit's no use: I never shall amount to anything with my surroundings.\"\r\n\r\nThe water gurgled over its boulders and the green landscape sent up an\r\nexquisite loamy breath. The young people, both representing the afflatus\r\nof the State, met in one tragic look which ended in a smile.\r\n\r\nNext morning Mallston took his usual post in the car, shifting from one\r\nbare foot to the other, while the photographer lounged on his locker\r\nwaiting for custom. The native frequently parted his shaggy jaws, but\r\nconsidered how he should offer his information. He watched his employer\r\nwith real attachment, and his dark red face deepened its hue around the\r\neyes as he broke out, \"We've got a little feller t' 'r house.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! not another one?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's two month ole,\" explained Mallston.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, your youngest. Why, yes, I've seen him.\" Mallston was evidently\r\nsurprised that so humble a creature as his youngest had attracted the\r\ngreat photographer's notice. \"He's a fine youngster,\" added the latter.\r\n\r\nMallston was then emboldened to blurt out, \"We've named him.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have? Well, what do you call him?\"\r\n\r\n\"We called him after you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, here's an honor! How did you come to name him for me?\"\r\n\r\n\"_I_ done it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me see: what can I do for him? Suppose you bring him over now while\r\nwe aren't very busy and I'll take his picture.\"\r\n\r\nMallston grinned with pleasure: \"My woman wanted his picter. My woman\r\n'lowed mebby you wouldn't charge for it if you knowed he was a\r\nnamesake.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly I won't. So bring him right along and we'll do our best for\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nIt was some time before he reappeared, carrying his youngest in his\r\narms, its cheeks polished and its wet hair turning over in rings, decked\r\nin its chief finery, a blue quilted cloak. The mother came along to hold\r\nher cherub in her lap. She was a long, raw-boned woman, immature in face\r\nunder all her crust of care and tan, evidently distressed in her free\r\nwaist by the tightness of her calico dress and in her unfenced feet by\r\nshoes.\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do with the baby?\" inquired Miss Gill kindly as\r\nshe encountered this group at right angles on her return from the\r\npost-office.\r\n\r\n\"Garn with him to the man to git his picter. Come in and see him took,\"\r\ninvited Mrs. Mallston timidly.\r\n\r\nThe young woman, ready to seize on any distraction, went in, scarcely\r\nunderstanding that her bruised ambition reached for healing to such\r\nhomely, lowly natures as these.\r\n\r\nThe artist was glad to see her, and she sat on the locker while\r\npreparations went on. She exchanged amused glances with him when the\r\nother Mallstons flocked to the steps, bellowing in various keys for\r\ntheir mother, and on their being swung in by one arm and placed in a row\r\non the opposite locker, she gazed at them in turn, wondering what the\r\nfuture held out to such lumps of dirt and sombre black eyes.\r\n\r\nMallston set his youngest on the mother's lap and looked at it with\r\nsneaking fondness. The whole tribe seemed equally dear to him, but this\r\nyoungest appealed to his strength. Mrs. Mallston was not celebrated as a\r\ntender mother. She went after pails of water and left her children\r\nplaying beside the railroad-track; their tattered and ludicrous\r\nappearance bespoke her unskilfulness with the needle; she was said to\r\nhave scalded the eldest boy with a skilletful of hot water in which she\r\nhad soaked bacon, pouring it out of the window on his head. But she\r\nprobably did as well as she knew how, and Mallston did much better. The\r\nphotographer watched him go back a dozen times to straighten the baby's\r\nsturdy legs, tap it under the chin with his colossal fore finger, cluck\r\nin the laughing red cavern of his mouth and change the folds of its\r\nquilted cloak with quite a professional air. What were poverty, the\r\nworld's neglect, hard labor and circumscribed life to this man? That\r\nmuscle which gathered and distributed the streams of his body may have\r\nbeen to him a heaven in which these five youngsters ministered as\r\nangels.\r\n\r\nThe young man felt moved with an emotion he resisted: \"My God! can it be\r\nthat this savage is right in his instincts, and I am wrong? Can some\r\npeculiar blessing of Heaven rest on the man who dares Fate for family\r\nlove? Or is the poor wretch's fondness a recompense for his overburdened\r\nlot?\"\r\n\r\nThe baby took a fine picture. Mallston stood by a window and gazed at\r\nthe large tin-type. His full lips dropped apart and his head leaned\r\nsidewise. He turned to his wife and said with a foolish expression, \"If\r\nthe little feller 'ud happen to drop off now we got sumpin' to remember\r\nhim by.\"\r\n\r\n\"My childern's kind o' sickly,\" remarked his wife, marshalling forth her\r\nquartette, \"fer all they look so hearty.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe photographic car remained day after day, although sitters seldom\r\ncame now, for even the loafers were helping to put in crops. The horses\r\nwhich should have dragged it out almost any dewy morning were not\r\nexactly eating their heads off, being turned upon pasture, but the\r\nlandlord was famous for getting his entertainment's worth. As long as\r\nweekly board-bills were paid he said it was none of his business if the\r\nman stayed all summer.\r\n\r\nOn Monday the photographer resolved, \"I will start on Wednesday;\" on\r\nWednesday he decided, \"I will wait till Saturday;\" and on Saturday,\r\n\"It's too late in the week now, but I _must_ go next Monday.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Harbison, when interviewed about the generous portion of time he\r\nspent on her lawn with her summer visitor, answered with downrightness,\r\n\"Well, what if he does like to come to our place? We know all about his\r\nfolks. And if them two wants to sit and talk, they're fit company fer\r\neach other, and I reckon it won't hurt 'em. So what you going to do\r\nabout it?\"\r\n\r\nThe village was going to talk about it. The female population gathered\r\nat the storekeeper's house, their favorite rallying-place because the\r\nstorekeeper's wife had no opinions of her own, but made a good echo to\r\nwhatever was said, and there they judged that Gill girl for taking up\r\nwith strangers like she done, so stuck up, and hoped it would turn out\r\nhe was a married man, and wouldn't that bring her down?\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the photographer stretched himself on his oilcloth-cushioned\r\nlocker and stared at the now fully-unfurled woods, without one mental\r\nglance at the vivid moss in its shades, its four varieties of ferns or\r\nthe ruined cabin with one side thrown down, showing nickers of sunlight\r\nthrough the gaps of its fireplace. He called himself ill names for\r\nremaining where he was, and made a crazy picture of a photographic car\r\nseesawing along the country roads, with a figure he well knew sitting on\r\nthe platform beside him as he drove. It was so absurd, but he quoted\r\nMrs. Dalles's song of \"Brave Love\" while he etched:\r\n\r\n    We could not want for long,\r\n      While my man had his violin\r\n    And I my sweet love-song.\r\n\r\n    The world has aye gone well with us,\r\n      Old man, since we were one:\r\n    Our homeless wanderings down the lanes,\r\n      They long ago were done.\r\n\r\nThen, across some chasm of indefinite time, he saw a studio and himself\r\nhappy at an easel, with this devoted dark face resting against his side,\r\nreciting her work to him and quivering with joy at some sign of success.\r\nBut the whole panorama dissolved at a breath.\r\n\r\n\"Now, aren't you a nice fellow,\" he addressed himself, \"a brilliant\r\nrascal, a wise genius, to be thinking of such a thing?\"\r\n\r\nMiss Gill was returning from the woods with a full basket before the\r\nmorning heat came on. A few women at the storekeeper's fence looked\r\nsidewise at each other as she paused to chat under the photographer's\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\nThe morning was so clear that every object stood in startling relief. A\r\nplume of steam far up the leafy railroad vista heralded the Peru\r\nexpress's lightning passage through the town. Scarcely a lounger was\r\nleft on the platform. Mallston had a job of cleaning the cellar for the\r\nstorekeeper, and at intervals appeared from its gaping doors with a\r\nbasket of decayed potatoes on his shoulders. The landscape rung with\r\nbird-songs, and the girl, who had skimmed the cream off such a morning,\r\nlooked up and laughed at her dejected friend. She had purple violets\r\ntucked into her coil of hair, her belt and under her collar.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing here? Why aren't you out trying to catch the effect\r\nof day-twilight in the thick woods?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've been trying,\" he replied without smiling, \"to catch the effect of\r\na rash action--and a woman's face.\"\r\n\r\n\"How solemn! Let me see it. Is it Mrs. Stillman's?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it isn't: it's my wife's.\"\r\n\r\nHer half-lifted hand dropped. While her eyes met his without blenching\r\nshe turned ghastly white, her face seeming to wither into sudden age.\r\n\r\nThe express-train whistled. Only a moment before its steam-plume had\r\nbeen her symbol of rushing success in life, and now, for some scarcely\r\napprehended reason, she felt that the train and Fate were running her\r\ndown. With intuitive resistance and a defiant sweep of her body she\r\nturned toward it and screamed aloud.\r\n\r\nThe photographer could not credit this rapid change to himself when he\r\nsaw upon the track a small rough cart drawn by Mallston's oldest girl\r\nand containing his youngest stretched upon a dirty pillow. The express\r\nwas coming down-grade at full speed, but at its whistle the oldest child\r\nturned off the track and tried to drag her burden across the rail. The\r\ncart upset, and the baby sprawled, crying, between the rails, while his\r\nsister fled crying toward home.\r\n\r\nThis whole occurrence was a flash: it seemed to the spectators they had\r\nbarely started forward with their blood curdling, the engine had but\r\nscreamed, and Mallston was merely seen dropping a basket of potatoes and\r\nleaping with upright hair and starting eyes, before the whole thing was\r\nover. The train stopped with such a recoil that many passengers were\r\nthrown from their seats: the engineer dropped from his cab, and there\r\nwas a crowd.\r\n\r\nMallston was jammed into a heap against a tall board fence which\r\nsurrounded the store-lot. The baby sprawled near him, where he had\r\nthrown it when the engine struck him.\r\n\r\n\"Are you hurt?\" asked the photographer, turning him over.\r\n\r\nHe sat up, looking dazed and ludicrous: \"Wher's the little feller?\"\r\n\r\n\"I got him,\" panted the breathless mother, shaking the child from side\r\nto side as she showed it to him.\r\n\r\n\"_He's_ all right,\" cried the engineer, \"but I hit you. Where are you\r\nhurt?\"\r\n\r\n\"I ain't hurt no place,\" said Mallston, crawling up on all fours, \"'cept\r\nwher' my back and head hit the fence.\" He stood up grinning at the\r\nexcited crowd, and put his sneaking, protecting fingertips under the\r\nbaby's chin. The youngest had ceased to yell during the fright, but this\r\ntouched him off again.\r\n\r\n\"You skeered the poor little feller,\" said Mallston severely, but the\r\nengineer was already mounting his cab, laughing with relief. The train\r\npassed on, people crowding the platforms.\r\n\r\nWomen felt the baby's limbs: there were no hurts except a bruise on one\r\nfat leg and a little more than the usual amount of dirt on its face.\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure you aren't injured?\" urged the photographer, shaking his\r\nman.\r\n\r\nBut Mallston looked into his eyes with a preoccupied mind, and said, as\r\nto the only person present who would appreciate the depth of the remark,\r\n\"I couldn't a-stood that, by jeeminy!\" Tears stood in his big bovine\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nThe group dispersed, many glad to have enjoyed such a genuine\r\nsensation, Mrs. Stillman declaring to the neighbor and the landlady she\r\nhadn't had such a skeer since the time _he_ was took in the dead o'\r\nnight with bleedin' at the lungs, and not a doctor in ten mile, and\r\nevery minute like to be his last, so it was.\r\n\r\nThe artist followed Miss Gill from the spot. She picked up her basket\r\nbeside the photographic car, her face so sublimated it seemed never to\r\nhave known any other look.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't understand human nature,\" she confessed to the photographer,\r\nwho had entered his car and again appeared at the window above her.\r\n\"That fellow has the poetry in him that I can't write out. I'm afraid\r\nI'm going to cry.\"\r\n\r\nThe artist held down his sketch-book to her. Dabbing back her tears with\r\none hand, she took it with the other and exclaimed at once, \"Why, you've\r\nsketched _me_!\"\r\n\r\n\"When a man like that dares so much for home happiness in this world, I\r\nthink I can dare a little, poor, struggling dog as I am. I called that a\r\nwhile ago the picture of my wife; and it shall be--my _woman_,\" infusing\r\nthe idiom of his native State with its primitive, tender meaning.\r\n\r\nShe handed back the book, and he took it, with her hand.\r\n\r\n\"Do you dare?\" trembled the girl with a laugh, mindful that all\r\nFairfield was out.\r\n\r\n\"I think I do,\" he replied, smiling also as he followed her eyes toward\r\na group proceeding down the railroad--\"even in spite of that.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Mallston was walking beside her husband, making a display of\r\nankle-bone under her scant calico wrapper, her sun-bonnet flapping to\r\nher nose, the four juveniles able to walk dangling from her fingers or\r\ndrapery. Mallston, straight as a hickory tree, carried his youngest on\r\nhis bosom, patting its cheek with his horny, potato-scented palm.\r\n\r\n  M.H. CATHERWOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EARLY DAYS OF MORMONISM.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor many years both before and after the Revolution the western part of\r\nNew York was claimed by Massachusetts. The dispute was finally settled\r\nin 1786 by the latter State retaining the title to the soil westward of\r\na meridian line extending from Pennsylvania to Lake Ontario. The line\r\nwas afterward ascertained to be the meridian of Washington. It passed\r\nnear Elmira, through the county of Seneca, and pierced the town of Lyons\r\nin the county of Wayne. The area of the Massachusetts claim was more\r\nthan seven million acres, or about fifteen counties as they are now\r\narranged. The entire tract was sold in 1787 to Oliver Phelps and Daniel\r\nGorman for one million dollars. Phelps and Gorman immediately proceeded\r\nto Canandaigua and obtained the Indian title to one third of the tract.\r\nA land-office was opened in that village, the first of its kind in\r\nAmerica. But the sales, although rapid, prevented the ruin neither of\r\nthe purchasers nor of Robert Morris, the financier of the Revolution,\r\nwho came forward to help them. The Holland Land Company profited by\r\nthese misfortunes. The rich valleys of the Genesee and its tributaries\r\nmore than made good its promises to actual settlers, as is readily\r\nproved by the waving fields of grain which greet the traveller through\r\nthat section to-day.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1815 there came to the town of Palmyra, in Wayne county, a\r\nfamily by the name of Smith. Their former home was Sharon, Vermont. The\r\nfather's name was Joseph, the mother's maiden name was Lucy Mack, and\r\nthey were both of Scotch descent. Their son Joseph, afterward \"the\r\nProphet,\" was born on December 23, 1805. Hyrum, another son, helped his\r\nfather at the trade of a cooper. Joseph, Jr., grew up with the\r\nreputation of being an idle and ignorant youth, given to\r\nchicken-thieving, and, like his father, extremely superstitious. Both\r\nfather and sons believed in witchcraft, and they frequently \"divined\"\r\nthe presence of water by a forked stick or hazel rod. Orlando Sanders of\r\nPalmyra, a well-preserved gentleman of over eighty, tells us that the\r\nSmith family worked for his father and for himself. He gives them the\r\ncredit of being good workers, but declares that they could save no\r\nmoney. He also states that Joseph, Jr., was \"a greeny,\" both large and\r\nstrong. By nature he was peaceably disposed, but when he had taken too\r\nmuch liquor he was inclined to fight, with or without provocation.\r\n\r\nThe profession of a water-witch did not bring enough ducats to the Smith\r\nfamily; so the attempt was made to find hidden treasures. Failing in\r\nthis, the unfolding flower of Mormonism would have been nipped in the\r\nbud had not Joe's father and brother been engaged in digging a well upon\r\nthe premises of Clark Chase in September, 1819. Joseph, Jr., stood idly\r\nby with some of the Chase children when a stone resembling a child's\r\nfoot was thrown from the well. The Chase children claimed the curiosity,\r\nas it was considered, but Joe seized and retained it. Afterward, for a\r\nseries of years, he claimed that by the use of it he was enabled to\r\ndiscover stolen property and to locate the place where treasure was\r\nburied.\r\n\r\nAfter living in Palmyra for about ten years, the Smith family moved\r\nsouthward a few miles and settled in Manchester, the northern town of\r\nOntario county. Their residence was a primitive one, even for those\r\ndays. William Van Camp, the aged editor of the _Democratic Press_ at\r\nLyons, recalls the fact that it was a log house from the following\r\ncircumstance. Martin Harris, a farmer near Palmyra, visited the Smiths\r\nwhile he was yet in doubt concerning the doctrines of Mormonism. One\r\nnight, while he was in his room, curtained off from the single large\r\nroom of the interior, there appeared to him no less a personage than\r\nJesus Christ. Harris was informed that Mormonism was the true faith, and\r\nVan Camp knows that it was a log house, although no vestige now\r\nremains, because Harris told him that his celestial visitor was lying on\r\nthe beam overhead!\r\n\r\nOne mile from the Smith residence was the farm of Alonzo Sanders, now\r\nowned by William T. Sampson, commander in the United States Navy. This\r\nfarm is four miles south of Palmyra, on the road toward Canandaigua. It\r\nincludes a barren hill which rises abruptly to the height of one hundred\r\nand fifty feet. The ridge runs almost due north and south, and from the\r\nsummit there are beautiful views of the hills surrounding Canandaigua\r\nand Seneca Lakes. It is known to the present generation as \"Gold Bible\r\nHill:\" to Joe Smith it was known as \"the Hill Cumorah,\" where the angel\r\nMoroni announced to him the presence of the \"golden plates\" giving an\r\naccount of the fate which attended the early inhabitants of America.\r\nWith these plates would be found the only means by which they could be\r\nread, the wonderful spectacles known as the \"Urim and Thummim.\" Joe was\r\nnot averse to such a revelation, for his hazel rod and his \"peek-stone\"\r\nhad already failed him. There had been various religious awakenings in\r\nthe neighborhood, and when the various sects began to quarrel over the\r\nconverts Joe arose and announced that his mission was to restore the\r\ntrue priesthood. He appointed a number of meetings, but no one seemed\r\ninclined to follow him as the leader of a new religion. In September,\r\n1823, an angel appeared to him, forgave his many lapses from grace and\r\nannounced the golden plates.\r\n\r\nThese plates, however, were not found for several years. In the mean\r\ntime the scene of Smith's operations shifted along the banks of Seneca\r\nLake and down the tributaries of the Susquehanna to the point where that\r\nriver sweeps southward into Pennsylvania past a borough of its own name,\r\nand then northward into New York, before it finally crosses Pennsylvania\r\non its way to the Chesapeake. The borough of Susquehanna forms an\r\nimportant station on the Erie Railway, one hundred and ninety miles\r\nnorth-west of New York City. All about the locality houses are built in\r\nlittle groups upon the steep hillsides: even the railroad-shops could\r\nnot be erected before the ground was levelled for them. When the river\r\nfirst cut a channel through the Appalachin Mountains it was very saving\r\nof its strength. Should anything besides the river attempt to enter this\r\nvalley it must either hang against the sides or swim.\r\n\r\nJoe Smith had paid several visits to this region when the first settlers\r\nwere struggling with the wilderness. It was a much wilder country than\r\nthat about Palmyra, and the inhabitants were much more credulous. Upon\r\nthese people Smith practised with his peek-stone. A number of aged\r\npersons now living in that vicinity give this description of the\r\nprophet: He was six feet or a trifle over in height; of stout build, but\r\nwiry; his hair and complexion were light; his eyes were blue and mild;\r\nand \"he did not look as if he knew enough to fool people so,\" as one old\r\nlady expresses it. When \"peeking\" he kneeled and buried his face in his\r\nwhite stovepipe hat, within which was the peek-stone. He declared it to\r\nbe so much like looking into the water that the \"deflection of flight\"\r\nsometimes took him out of his course. On a wilderness-hill--now a part\r\nof Jacob J. Skinner's farm--his peek-stone discovered a ton of silver\r\nbars which had been buried by weary Spaniards as they trudged up the\r\nSusquehanna. An expedition for their recovery was undertaken as soon as\r\nSmith could muster enough followers to do the work. Unlike St. Paul, Joe\r\ndid not work with his own hands, and he did not hesitate to be\r\nchargeable to any one. Several round excavations were made on the crown\r\nof a hill, the largest of which was about thirty-five feet in diameter\r\nand of about the same depth. The water was drained toward the south, and\r\na shanty covered the hole from the eyes of the scoffers and the profane.\r\nThe diggers had proceeded with great labor, and were just ready to grasp\r\nthe silver, when the charm moved it three hundred feet to the\r\nnorth-east. Joe tracked it with his peek-stone to its hiding-place. It\r\nwas not so far under the surface this time--only about twenty feet--and\r\nthe faithful again worked with a will. The dilatory movements of the\r\nsilver caused anxiety to Mr. Isaac Hale, with whom the diggers had been\r\n\"boarding round.\" Hale was a stiff old Methodist whose business judgment\r\ntold him that he was taking too much stock in this \"big bonanza.\" For\r\nall his anxiety, the silver again flitted away, and alighted fifty feet\r\nbeyond the big hole. They determined to capture it if they ran the hill\r\nthrough a sieve. The third hole had been sunk fifteen out of the\r\nnecessary twenty feet when the treasure once more jumped to the other\r\nside of the big hole. Then the prophet had a vision: the blood of a\r\nblack sheep must be shed and sprinkled around the diggings. Black sheep\r\nwere scarce, and while they waited for one the faithful obtained their\r\nneeded rest. At length, no sheep appearing, Joe said that a black dog\r\nmight answer. A dog, therefore, was killed, and the blood was sprinkled\r\non the ground. After that the silver never went far away. Still, it\r\nwaltzed about the big hole in such a lively manner that frequent\r\ntunnelling to effect its capture availed nothing. At last the prophet\r\ndecided that it was of no use to dig unless one of their number was made\r\na sacrifice. None of the faithful responded to his call, and thus the\r\nmagnificent scheme was abandoned. Oliver Harper, one of the diggers who\r\nfurnished the money, was soon afterward murdered. The prophet thought\r\nthis might answer for a sacrifice: he again rallied the diggers, but the\r\ncharm remained stubborn and would not reveal the silver.[2]\r\n\r\nThere was, however, another object for which Smith said the Lord had\r\nsent him to Susquehanna; and that was--a wife. Until he obtained one\r\nthere was no use in trying to get certain buried treasures at Palymra. A\r\nheadless Spaniard guarded it with great vigilance, but would, it\r\nappeared, be driven away if Smith should shake millinery and dry-goods\r\nbills at him. Joseph stopped at the house of Isaac Hale, already noticed\r\nas having furnished board to the diggers. Mr. Hale owned a farm on the\r\nnorth side of the river, a mile and a half below the present borough of\r\nSusquehanna. He had three daughters, two of them already married. The\r\nsecond daughter, Emma, was easily persuaded to join her fortunes with\r\nthose of the adventurer. The father, however, made so much opposition\r\nthat they crossed over into the State of New York, and were married at\r\nWindsor, a neighboring town. This was probably early in 1826. Mr. Hale\r\nthreatened to shoot his son-in-law--the \"Peeker,\" as he called him--if\r\nhe ever returned.\r\n\r\nAbout these days, every other means of gaining a living without honest\r\nwork having been exhausted, the prophet thought it was time to find the\r\ngolden plates. Returning to the vicinity of Palmyra, Smith and his\r\nfollowers began to dig for the plates on the eastern side of the hill.\r\nIt was announced that each one of the diggers must be pure in deed, and\r\nthat no evil thought must cross his mind as he worked. One night a spade\r\nstruck an iron box at the same moment that an evil thought seized one of\r\nthe diggers. The box sank to lower depths amid thunder and lightning,\r\nwhile Smith announced that nothing could be done that night but to go\r\nhome and pray. They were more fortunate, however, in leaving their evil\r\nthoughts at home on the night of September 22, 1826, for then, according\r\nto the faithful, the golden plates were taken from \"the Hill Cumorah\r\nwith a mighty display of celestial machinery.\" It is recorded that after\r\nthe prize had been delivered to the prophet by angels his eyes were\r\nopened and he saw legions of devils struggling with a celestial host to\r\nkeep the plates concealed. On his return to Susquehanna with a bandaged\r\nhead, Smith gave out that he had had an encounter with the chief devil,\r\nand been severely wounded by a blow \"struck from the shoulder.\"\r\n\r\nWith the golden plates were also found the Urim and Thummim, the magic\r\nspectacles or religious peek-stones, \"transparent and clear as crystal,\"\r\nwhich should translate the hieroglyphics on the plates. There were three\r\nwitnesses who swore by all that was sacred that the angel of the Lord\r\nlaid these plates before them, and that \"they were translated by the\r\ngift and power of God.\" The three witnesses were Oliver Cowdery, who was\r\nfinally expelled from the brotherhood in Missouri; David Whitner, who\r\nabandoned the Mormons and settled in Richmond, Missouri, where he still\r\nlives; and Martin Harris, who quarrelled with Smith in the same State\r\nand returned to New York to live.\r\n\r\nSuch a precious treasure as was now in the hands of Smith was not to be\r\n\"borne in earthly vessels frail.\" He applied to Willard Chase, a son of\r\nthat Clark Chase on whose premises the original peek-stone was\r\ndiscovered, to make him a wooden box for the plates. The compensation\r\nwas to be a share in the prospective profits from the \"Gold Book.\"\r\nChase's lack of faith in both the man and the book caused him to decline\r\nthe work. Smith thereupon thrust his gold plates and the rings which\r\nconnected them into a bag of beans and started for Susquehanna. Twenty\r\nmiles above that borough lies the village of Harpersville. Here lived\r\nBenjamin Wasson, who married one of Mrs. Smith's sisters. Wasson was a\r\ncabinetmaker, and, although not a Mormon, he made a strong box for the\r\nplates. Smith announced that no one could look into the box and live,\r\nbut when his father-in-law, Hale, wished to try it Smith hid the box in\r\nthe woods. Hale, in his statement of 1834, declared that Smith\r\ntranslated the plates in his own house, \"with the stone in his hat and\r\nhis hat over his face,\" while the plates were still hid in the woods.\r\n\r\nFortunately for Smith, he did not have to depend upon Hale for a place\r\nin which to carry on his operations. His wife had a six-acre place in a\r\ncorner of her father's farm, adjoining the farm of Joseph McKune. Upon\r\nthis little strip of land Smith moved a partly-finished house,\r\ntwenty-six feet broad, eighteen feet deep and fourteen feet in the\r\nposts. It is evident, from the stovepipe through the roof, that the\r\nedifice was never finished. After Smith left this region Martin Harris\r\ncame from Palmyra and sold the house to McKune, whose widow lived in it\r\nfor about forty years. It is now the farm-residence of her son, Benjamin\r\nMcKune, high sheriff of Susquehanna county, and lies close to the track\r\nof the Erie Railway, a mile and a half west of Susquehanna Depot. The\r\nelder McKune strongly suspected that Smith and his gang were\r\ncounterfeiters.\r\n\r\nThe prophet's original plan was that the plates should be translated by\r\nan infant son, who should perform other miracles and become his\r\nsuccessor. But his expectations were doomed to disappointment, for in a\r\nlittle fern-grown cemetery near at hand is a tottering slab of black\r\nsandstone with the simple inscription, \"In memory of an infant son of\r\nJoseph and Emma Smith, June 15, 1828.\" Hence the magic spectacles were\r\nvery opportunely found with the plates. The little low chamber in\r\nSmith's house was used as a translating-room. The prophet and his plates\r\nwere screened even from the sight of his scribes, Martin Harris, Oliver\r\nCowdery and Reuben Hale, by blankets secured with nails. While the\r\ntranslation was going on the neighbors frequently called to discuss the\r\nforthcoming book, which, it was alleged, would make the Hale family very\r\nrich. Occasionally a visitor was allowed to feel the thickness of the\r\nGolden Book as it reposed within a pillow-case, but no one was permitted\r\nto see it.[3]\r\n\r\nThe \"celestial machinery\" for the translating process was very simple.\r\nA copy of the hieroglyphics was taken, and then Smith either wrote his\r\ntranslation on a slate or dictated for others to write on paper. Martin\r\nHarris having taken a scroll containing some of the hieroglyphics to\r\nProfessor Anthon, the characters were pronounced to be partly Greek,\r\npartly Hebrew and partly Roman inverted, with a rude copy of Humboldt's\r\nMexican calendar at the end. That the prophet was not well advanced\r\neither in Greek or English appears from a story related by the Rev.\r\nHenry Caswall, who visited Nauvoo, Illinois, in 1842. He had with him a\r\ncopy of the Psalter in Greek, which he handed to the prophet and asked\r\nhim to explain its contents. Smith looked at it a few moments, and then\r\nreplied, \"No, it ain't Greek at all, except perhaps a few words. What\r\nain't Greek is Egyptian, and what ain't Egyptian is Greek. This book is\r\nvery valuable: _it is a dictionary of Egyptian hieroglyphics_.\" Pointing\r\nto the capital letters at the beginning of each verse, he said, \"Them\r\nfigures is Egyptian hieroglyphics, and them which follows is the\r\ninterpretation of the hieroglyphics, written in the reformed Egyptian.\r\nThem characters is like the letters that was engraved on the golden\r\nplates.\" Upon this the Mormons began to congratulate Mr. Caswall on the\r\ninformation he was receiving. \"There!\" they said, \"we told you so: we\r\ntold you that our prophet would give you satisfaction. None but our\r\nprophet can explain these mysteries.\" The prophet then attempted to buy\r\nthe book, on the ground that it could be of no use to Caswall, because\r\nhe did not understand it! Refusing to sell, Caswall inquired the meaning\r\nof certain of the hieroglyphics on the papyrus of the prophet. When\r\ncornered the prophet slipped out of the room, and Caswall saw him no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nMrs. McKune relates the particulars of an incident which took place\r\nearly in 1828. Martin Harris had advanced so much money to Smith that\r\nhis wife came from Palmyra in great alarm to arrest the destruction of\r\nproperty and to reclaim her husband if possible. Harris showed her the\r\nsacred writings, already nearly completed, as an inducement for her to\r\nhold her peace. She found where the manuscript was concealed, and at\r\nonce secured it. When asked to return it she replied, \"Joe Smith may\r\npeek for it.\" This he attempted to do, but accused her of unfairly\r\nremoving the manuscript whenever the attendants had almost reached it.\r\nAfter waiting a little time, she produced a portion of the roll and\r\ndeclared Smith to be a fraud. The remainder of the manuscript she\r\nretained, and finally burned it, with the remark, \"If it cannot be found\r\nthere will be an end to the partnership between Joe Smith and my\r\nhusband.\" Joe never undertook to use his wonderful spectacles for a\r\nsecond translation of the matter in the missing manuscript: he feared\r\nthat Mrs. Harris might produce a totally different Bible consisting of\r\nhis first translation.\r\n\r\nMrs. Squires and Mrs. McKune agree in saying that no converts were made\r\nby Smith and Harris in the vicinity of Susquehanna. The scene of the\r\nMormon endeavors was suddenly moved along the beautiful valley of the\r\nSusquehanna to a point north of the Appalachin Mountains and just within\r\nthe borders of New York. In the locality of Harpersville and Nineveh a\r\nbroad plain had been settled by a colony of emigrants called \"the\r\nVermont Sufferers,\" from their having formerly occupied land which was\r\nclaimed by both Massachusetts and New York. Three miles above Nineveh\r\nlies Afton, just on the edge of Chenango county, and a short distance\r\nabove are Sidney, in Delaware county, and Otego, in Otsego county. Smith\r\nand his followers operated with the peek-stone in this part of the\r\nvalley, where he was a comparative stranger. George Collington, one of\r\nthe most substantial farmers in Broome county, was then a lad of\r\nsixteen. One evening, at twilight, he discovered Smith, Joseph Knight,\r\nWilliam Hale (uncle of Smith's wife) and two men named Culver and\r\nBlowers in the act of dodging through the woods with shovels and picks\r\nupon their shoulders, their object being to discover a salt-spring by\r\nthe agency of the peek-stone. He followed them, under cover of the\r\nbrush, to a point where they stopped for consultation and finally\r\ndecided to dig the next day. Noticing that Bostwick Badger, who then\r\nowned the farm now occupied by Collington, had felled an oak near the\r\nplace, and that he had drawn out the timber, Collington obtained\r\npermission to cut the top for wood. Collington's axe and the prophet's\r\ndiggers began operations about the same time on the following morning.\r\nOut from the treetop came Collington and asked what they were doing.\r\nThey told him to mind his business, which he did by thoroughly\r\npublishing them about the neighborhood--a proceeding that brought them a\r\nnumber of unwelcome visitors in the place of one. Frederick Davenport\r\nfurnished young Collington with a half bushel of salt to be deposited in\r\nthe hole at night. By morning the water had dissolved the salt and\r\nretained its briny flavor. Bottles were filled for exhibition, and the\r\nstock of the converts in the peek-stone ran high until the trick was\r\ndiscovered. It was claimed that the peek-stone also pointed out an\r\nextensive silver-mine on the farm of Abram Cornell at Bettsburg, nearly\r\nopposite Nineveh. No silver was found except that furnished by Josiah\r\nStowell, a not over-bright man whose little all went into the pocket of\r\nSmith.\r\n\r\nHowever much he might fail in discovering material treasures, Smith's\r\nhold upon the religious infatuation of his followers grew more and more\r\nstrong. John Morse, an aged convert to Mormonism, had recently died, and\r\nSmith was sent for to restore him to life. After looking at him Smith\r\ndeclined, because it would be a pity to have him suffer rheumatism and\r\ndie again so soon! This was something like Brigham Young's refusal to\r\nrestore a lost leg to one of his Mormons, on the ground that if he did\r\nit the man would be obliged to walk on three legs all through eternity!\r\n\r\nMrs. Marsh says that Joseph Knight and his sons were on one occasion in\r\nher husband's hay-field, and boldly declared that Smith could perform\r\nmiracles. On being challenged for an example, Joseph Knight said, \"The\r\nprophet cast the Devil out of me. He looked like a black cat; and he\r\nran into a pile of brush.\" The prophet prayed for a deceased shoemaker\r\nin Greene, Chenango county. This man had joined their Church, and the\r\nMormons needed his property to help them in leaving the country. The\r\nwidow refused to sign the property over until the prayers had been\r\noffered for the return of her husband. The prayers having availed\r\nnothing, the executor sought to recover the property. Thomas A. Johnson,\r\nthen a law-student and a brother of Mrs. Marsh, was sent to Harpersville\r\nto get possession. Smith's followers were encamped in the barn of Joseph\r\nKnight, and they threatened to shoot. By the advice of friends Johnson\r\ncompromised the matter by taking a valuable horse.\r\n\r\nAll accounts agree that Smith drank freely, both in the Susquehanna and\r\nin the Harpersville neighborhoods. Mrs. McKune relates that one night\r\nSmith volunteered to pray the frost away from the corn-field of his\r\nbrother-in-law, Michael Morse. The field was not saved, probably because\r\nit had an exposure toward the north and the west. A number of witnesses\r\nin the vicinity of Nineveh remember that the prophet set a day for that\r\nvillage to sink, but that he afterward repented and withdrew his curse.\r\nHe did, however, announce that on a certain evening, about twilight, he\r\nwould walk on the water. The place of his selection was watched by\r\nGentile boys until one of Smith's followers was seen to construct a\r\nbridge of planks just under the surface. Watching their opportunity, the\r\nboys removed the outer planks. Before the prophet made the attempt to\r\nwalk he exhorted his followers to have strong faith. When his bridge\r\nsuddenly gave way he swam ashore and said, \"Woe unto you of little\r\nfaith! Your faith would not hold me up.\"\r\n\r\nThere were other boys in the neighborhood who thought it rare sport to\r\nannoy the Mormons. The same Joseph Knight who has already figured in\r\nthis narrative owned a small farm on which he had built a combined\r\ngrist- and carding-mill. The power was obtained by means of a small\r\nstream, the outlet of Perch Pond to the Susquehanna River, opposite\r\nHarpersville. This stream was dammed, so that the Mormon converts might\r\nbe baptized by immersion. The day for the ceremony was fixed, but the\r\nboys so persistently destroyed the dam that the Mormons did not attempt\r\nto rebuild it till the night before, and then they were obliged to stand\r\nguard until the hour for the baptism had arrived. Knight's barn was a\r\nrude structure of about forty by thirty feet, but it served the purpose\r\nof a tabernacle in the wilderness for a number of months. The prophet\r\nhimself was not a very successful preacher, but the versatile Sidney\r\nRigdon more than made up for his defects. Smith Baker gives Rigdon the\r\ncredit of being \"a decent speaker, as preachers averaged in those days.\"\r\n\r\nA semblance of persecution having strengthened the Church, the Gentile\r\ninhabitants of the Susquehanna Valley were glad when a \"revelation\"\r\ncaused the sixty Mormons to pack their traps and move westward. Some of\r\nthe followers were moved by a spirit of adventure, while others placed\r\ntheir property in the common lot and determined to accompany the prophet\r\nto his earthly as well as to his heavenly kingdom. Smith Baker was one of\r\nthe teamsters, and reports that the train consisted of three baggage- and\r\neleven passenger-wagons. The exodus was along the old State road, north of\r\nBinghamton, to Ithaca, and thence, across Cayuga Lake, to Palmyra.\r\n\r\nThe Saints in the region about the Gold Bible Hill had not been idle\r\nwhile these things were occurring in Susquehanna. William Van Camp\r\nrelates that he and all the other boys believed Hen Pack Hill, a mile\r\neast of Palmyra, would open to allow a giant to step forth and place his\r\nfoot upon Palmyra to crush it. This would be the end of all disbelievers\r\nin Mormonism, and the Saints would at once be gathered together in that\r\nvicinity. \"I did not know then,\" says Mr. Van Camp, \"how easy it is for\r\nmen to lie.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Van Camp is about seventy years old, and Major John H. Gilbert, who\r\nstill resides in Palmyra, is about seventy-six. Both of these gentlemen\r\nwere working in the office of the _Wayne Sentinel_, E.B. Grandin\r\nproprietor, during the months from September, 1829, to March, 1830, the\r\ntime during which the Book of Mormon was in process of printing. The\r\noffice was in the third story of a building now known as \"Exchange Row,\"\r\nin the principal street of Palmyra. The foreman was Mr. Pomeroy Tucker,\r\nwho afterward published a work on Mormonism. Major Gilbert was a\r\ncompositor and also a dancing-master. His duties in the latter calling\r\ntook him away from his \"case\" so frequently that Van Camp \"distributed\"\r\nin order to give him a chance to work the next day. The \"copy\" was on\r\nruled paper--an expensive thing in those days--and the letters were so\r\nclosely crowded together that words like _and_ or _the_ were divided at\r\nthe end of the line. The copy was in Cowdery's handwriting, but it was\r\nproduced from a tightly-buttoned coat every morning by Hyrum Smith. One\r\nday's supply only was given at a time, and even this was carefully taken\r\naway at night, there being but one occasion when permission was given to\r\nMajor Gilbert to take it away from the office. Major Gilbert and others\r\nsay that David Whitner of Richmond, Missouri, has this manuscript copy;\r\nand it has been stated recently that he has been called upon by\r\nofficials from Salt Lake City to produce it, and refused.[4]\r\n\r\nThere were no marks of punctuation in the copy--a sore trial to both\r\nTucker and Gilbert in \"reading proof.\" At such times Cowdery\r\noccasionally \"held the copy.\" In the absence of Cowdery the\r\nproof-readers often resorted to the orthodox Bible to verify some foggy\r\npassage. The \"matter\" was \"paged\" so that thirty-two pages could be\r\nprinted at a time on one of Hoe's \"Smith\" six-column hand-presses. After\r\nthe sheets had been run through once and properly dried, they were\r\nreversed and printed on the other side. The bookbinder then folded them\r\nby hand, and severed them with an ivory paper-cutter. The result was\r\nthat the twenty-five hundred large sheets made five thousand small\r\nsheets, with sixteen pages printed upon each side. Major Gilbert has an\r\nunbound copy of the book, which he saved, sheet by sheet, as it came\r\nfrom the press.\r\n\r\nMartin Harris furnished the funds for printing the book by a mortgage of\r\nthree thousand dollars on his farm. He celebrated the completion of the\r\nwork by inviting all the printers to his house. Mrs. Harris (the same\r\nwho secreted the manuscript at Susquehanna) had not signed the mortgage.\r\nHarris brought his guests within the door--as Van Camp relates it--and\r\nintroduced them to his wife, who bowed coldly and took no pains to\r\nwelcome them. At length Harris asked for the cider-pitcher, and went to\r\nthe spot indicated by his wife. Returning with it in his hand, he showed\r\na large hole in the bottom. \"Well,\" said Mrs. Harris, \"it has as much\r\nbottom as your old Bible has.\" There was enough bottom to the Bible,\r\nhowever, to give a comfortable sum of money to \"Joseph Smith, Jr.,\r\nAuthor and Proprietor.\" Orlando Sanders, son of Alonzo Sanders before\r\nmentioned, says that the Smiths made too much money to walk any longer:\r\nhe sold them a horse, and he now has a Bible which he took in payment\r\nfor a bridle.\r\n\r\nThe most reasonable theory of the origin of the Book of Mormon connects\r\nthe work directly with Solomon Spalding, a soldier of the Revolution\r\nfrom Connecticut and a graduate from Dartmouth in the class of 1785.\r\nFailing health induced Spalding to leave the ministry and to join his\r\nbrother in a mercantile life at Cherry Valley and Richfield, New York.\r\nIn 1809 he removed thence to Conneaut, in Ashtabula county, the extreme\r\nnorth-eastern corner of Ohio. Next west of Ashtabula is Lake county,\r\nwherein is located Kirtland--a place of great historic interest to the\r\nMormons, as will appear before our narrative closes. While Spalding was\r\nin Conneaut he wrote a few novels of so unmeritorious a nature that no\r\none would publish them. At length the opening of an Indian mound gave\r\nhim a basis of facts upon which he built a story relating to the Indian\r\npopulation of America and its descent from the Lost Tribes of Israel. He\r\nannounced that the title of his novel would be _The Manuscript Found_,\r\nand that he proposed to publish a sensational story of its discovery in\r\na cave in Ohio. Spalding frequently read extracts to his friends, and\r\none of them furnished him with money, so that he could proceed to\r\nPittsburg and have the novel printed. The manuscript remained in the\r\noffice of Patterson & Lambdin in that city for some time, but it was\r\nnever published. It is probable that it was taken away by Spalding, who\r\ndied shortly after (in 1816) at Amity, Washington county, near\r\nPittsburg. While it was in the office it is believed that Sidney Rigdon,\r\na young printer, was so pleased with the novel that he took a copy for\r\nfuture use. Rigdon was born in Alleghany county, Pennsylvania, February\r\n19, 1793. He received a fair English education, and in 1817 became an\r\northodox Christian preacher. He soon gave forth strange doctrines, which\r\nwere founded on the manuscript in his possession, and then he abandoned\r\npreaching for a number of years \"to study the Bible,\" as he expressed\r\nit. Moving into Lake county, Ohio, he prepared the minds of his\r\nfollowers for some new _ism_. It cannot be accurately stated just when,\r\nwhere and how he met Joseph Smith and added his religious enthusiasm to\r\nthe humbuggery of the Peeker. But that such a union was formed appears\r\nfrom the talk of Smith regarding the gold plates, and from the actual\r\nfinding of them in the manner proposed by Spalding fourteen years\r\nbefore. The union is still more evident when we listen to witnesses who\r\nhad heard Spalding's readings, and who afterward recognized them in the\r\nBook of Mormon, with additions of a religious nature. These witnesses\r\nnoted certain inconsistencies in the Book of Mormon which they had\r\nformerly discovered in Spalding's novel. History records that the widow\r\nof Spalding sent the manuscript to Conneaut, where it was publicly\r\ncompared with the printed book and the fraud exposed. Soon afterward the\r\nmanuscript was spirited away from Mrs. Spalding, probably to avoid the\r\ncertainty of a still more convincing disclosure. Major Gilbert\r\ntestified that Rigdon dogged Smith's footsteps about Palmyra for nearly\r\ntwo years before the Bible was printed. He is of opinion that Rigdon was\r\namong those who listened to Spalding in Conneaut, and took notes on\r\nthose occasions. The Bible itself is full of the religious questions\r\nwhich stirred the people of Western New York in those days--a most\r\nstrange thing in a celestial work of such great antiquity.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the publication of the Book the Church was duly\r\norganized at Manchester. On April 6, 1830, six members were ordained\r\nelders--Joseph Smith, Sr., Joseph Smith, Jr., Hyrum Smith, Samuel Smith,\r\nOliver Cowdery and Joseph Knight. The first conference was held at\r\nFayette, Seneca county, in June. A special \"revelation\" at this time\r\nmade Smith's wife \"the Elect Lady and Daughter of God,\" with the\r\nhigh-sounding title of \"Electa Cyria.\" In later years this lady became\r\ndisgusted with her husband's religion, and refused after his death to\r\nleave Illinois for Utah. She remained in Nauvoo, and married a Gentile\r\nnamed Bidamon. For a long time she kept the Mansion House in that place,\r\nwhere she died April 30, 1879.\r\n\r\nAnother revelation was to the effect that Palmyra was not the\r\ngathering-place of the Saints, after all, but that they should proceed\r\nto Kirtland in Ohio. Consequently, the early part of 1831 saw them\r\ncolonized in that place, the move being known as \"The First Hegira.\"\r\nStill another revelation (on the 6th of June) stated that some point in\r\nMissouri was the reliable spot. Smith immediately selected a tract in\r\nJackson county, near Independence. By 1833 the few Mormons who had moved\r\nthither were so persecuted that they went into Clay county, and thence,\r\nin 1838, into Caldwell county, naming their settlement \"Far West.\" The\r\nmain body of the Mormons, however, remained in Kirtland from 1831 till\r\nthey were forced to join their Western brethren in 1838. Brigham Young,\r\nanother native of Vermont, joined at Kirtland in 1832, and was ordained\r\nan elder. The conference of elders on May 3, 1833, repudiated the name\r\nof \"Mormons\" and adopted that of \"Latter-Day Saints.\" The first\r\npresidency consisted of Smith, Rigdon and Frederick G. Williams. In May,\r\n1835, the Twelve Apostles--among them Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball\r\nand Orson Hyde--left on a mission for proselytes. During the same year\r\nRigdon's _Book of Doctrine and Covenants_ and his _Lectures on Faith_\r\nwere adopted. A professor of Hebrew also joined them, and all the male\r\nadults entered upon the study of that language with a will.\r\n\r\nRigdon was by far the ablest man in the band. His earlier religious\r\naffiliations were with the Campbellites, now called Disciples. At the\r\ntime of the Mormon advent he lived in Mentor, the next town to Kirtland,\r\nbut he had no farm or any other property to offer them, as has been\r\nfrequently stated. Those of his followers whom he found in Kirtland\r\nfrequently remarked that they \"had a good time before Joe Smith came.\" A\r\nvery clear idea of his religious power may be gained by the following\r\nstatement of Judge John Barr, ex-sheriff of Cuyahoga county, Ohio, and a\r\nmost excellent authority on the history of the Western Reserve. The\r\nstatement has never been made public hitherto: \"In 1830 I was deputy\r\nsheriff, and, being at Willoughby (now in Lake county) on official\r\nbusiness, determined to go to Mayfield, which is seven or eight miles up\r\nthe Chagrin River, and hear Cowdery and Rigdon on the revelations of\r\nMormonism. Varnem J. Card, the lawyer, and myself started early Sunday\r\nmorning on horseback. We found the roads crowded with people going in\r\nthe same direction. Services in the church were opened by Cowdery with\r\nprayer and singing, in which he thanked God fervently for the new\r\nrevelation. He related the manner of finding the golden plates of Nephi.\r\nHe was followed by Rigdon, a famous Baptist preacher, well known\r\nthroughout the eastern part of the Western Reserve and also in Western\r\nPennsylvania. His voice and manner were always imposing. He was regarded\r\nas an eloquent man at all times, and now he seemed fully aroused. He\r\nsaid he had not been satisfied in his religious yearnings until now. At\r\nnight he had often been unable to sleep, walking and praying for more\r\nlight and comfort in his religion. While in the midst of this agony he\r\nheard of the revelation of Joe Smith, which Brother Cowdery had\r\nexplained: under this his soul suddenly found peace. It filled all his\r\naspirations. At the close of a long harangue in this earnest manner,\r\nduring which every one present was silent, though very much affected, he\r\ninquired whether any one desired to come forward and be immersed. Only\r\none man arose. This was an aged 'dead-beat' by the name of Cahoon, who\r\noccasionally joined the Shakers, and lived on the country generally. The\r\nplace selected for immersion was a clear pool in the river above the\r\nbridge, around which was a beautiful rise of ground on the west side for\r\nthe audience. On the east bank was a sharp bluff and some stumps, where\r\nMr. Card and myself stationed ourselves. The time of baptism was fixed\r\nat 2 P.M. Long before this hour the spot was surrounded by as many\r\npeople as could have a clear view. Rigdon went into the pool--which at\r\nthe deepest was about four feet--and after a suitable address, with\r\nprayer, Cahoon came forward and was immersed. Standing in the water,\r\nRigdon gave one of his most powerful exhortations. The assembly became\r\ngreatly affected. As he proceeded he called for the converts to step\r\nforward. They came through the crowd in rapid succession to the number\r\nof thirty, and were immersed, with no intermission of the discourse on\r\nthe part of Rigdon. Mr. Card was apparently the most stoical of men--of\r\na clear, unexcitable temperament, with unorthodox and vague religious\r\nideas. He afterward became prosecuting attorney for Cuyahoga county.\r\nWhile the exciting scene was transpiring below us in the valley and in\r\nthe pool, the faces of the crowd expressing the most intense emotion,\r\nMr. Card suddenly seized my arm and said, 'Take me away!' Taking his\r\narm, I saw that his face was so pale that he seemed to be about to\r\nfaint. His frame trembled as we walked away and mounted our horses. We\r\nrode a mile toward Willoughby before a word was said. Rising the hill\r\nout of the valley, he seemed to recover, and said, 'Mr. Barr, if you had\r\nnot been there I certainly should have gone into the water.' He said the\r\nimpulse was irresistible.\"\r\n\r\nKirtland is on the Kirtland branch of the Chagrin River, so named from\r\nthe disappointment of a party of early surveyors, who thought they were\r\nin the valley of the Cuyahoga, the first river to the westward. The\r\nvillage is nine miles west of Painesville, three from Willoughby and\r\ntwenty-two from Cleveland. Mentor is the nearest station on the Lake\r\nShore Railway. Besides the Temple, the Mormons erected a number of\r\nsubstantial buildings, which show that they expected to remain in\r\nKirtland. The residences of Smith and Rigdon are almost under the eaves\r\nof the Temple, and the theological seminary is now occupied by the\r\nMethodists for a church. A square mile was laid out in half-acre lots,\r\nand a number of farms were bought--the \"Church farm\" being half a mile\r\ndown one of the most beautiful valleys which it is possible to conceive\r\nin a range of country so uniformly level.\r\n\r\nMany an interesting story is told regarding the Mormon methods of\r\ncarrying on business with the merchants of Cleveland. A bank was\r\nstarted, like other \"wild-cat\" banks of that period, without a charter\r\nfrom the State of Ohio. The institution was called \"The Kirtland Safety\r\nSociety Bank.\" A number of its bills of issue may be seen at the rooms\r\nof the Western Reserve Historical Society in Cleveland. An examination\r\nof these bills shows that early in 1837 Smith was cashier and Rigdon was\r\npresident, Two or three months later either Rigdon or Williams was\r\nsecretary, and Smith was treasurer. Thus the process of inflation must\r\nhave been both easy and rapid. Richard Hilliard, a leading merchant of\r\nCleveland, received their bills for a few days, and then took possession\r\nof all their available assets. They were also in debt for their farms\r\nand for goods bought in New York. The bubble burst, and many in the\r\nvicinity of Kirtland were among the sufferers. Smith and Rigdon fled to\r\nFar West, after having been tarred and feathered for their peculiar\r\ntheories of finance.\r\n\r\nThe Mormons were driven from Missouri by Governor Boggs's \"Extraordinary\r\nOrder,\" which caused them to gain sympathy as having been persecuted in\r\na slave State. They moved to Hancock county, Illinois, in 1840, and\r\nbuilt up Nauvoo by a charter with most unusual privileges. Smith here\r\nannounced a new revelation, sustaining polygamy, which was supplemented\r\nby Young in 1852. His rebellious followers started a paper, which he\r\npromptly demolished. He was under arrest by the State authorities when a\r\nmob shot him on the 27th of June, 1844. On his death Brigham Young\r\ntricked the expectant Rigdon out of the successorship. Rigdon then\r\nrefused to recognize Young's authority, and for this contumacy he was\r\nexcommunicated and delivered to the Devil \"to be buffeted in the flesh\r\nfor a thousand years.\" Returning to Pittsburg, Rigdon led a life of\r\nutter obscurity, and finally died in Friendship, Allegany county, New\r\nYork, July 14, 1876. Cowdery, Whitner and Harris either deserted or were\r\ncut off. The Legislature of Illinois repealed the charter of Nauvoo in\r\n1845. Most of the Mormons gathered at Council Bluffs, Iowa, in June,\r\n1846. Those who were left in Nauvoo were driven out at the point of the\r\nbayonet. Early in 1847 pioneers crossed the Plains to Salt Lake Valley,\r\nwhither Young followed them in July. A crop was raised that year. In\r\n1848 the main body of the Mormons were safely lodged within the confines\r\nof Utah.\r\n\r\nBy far the most important and enduring monument left by the Mormons in\r\nKirtland is their Temple. The advent of several hundred strangers into\r\nthe midst of the insignificant hamlet was an event of considerable\r\nimportance, but when they selected a most commanding site, of easy\r\naccess to the public highway, and commenced the building of a church,\r\nall Northern Ohio looked on in wonder. A structure of such pretensions\r\nwould be a tax upon a goodly-sized town of this generation, but the\r\nseveral hundred Mormons who built it gave cheerfully each one his tenth\r\nin labor, materials or money for the four years from 1832 to 1836, the\r\nentire cost being estimated at forty thousand dollars. The visitor, come\r\nfrom whatever direction he may, has the Temple constantly in view as a\r\nreminder of the quainter style of \"meeting-houses\" in New England. Its\r\narchitectural superiority over the meeting-houses is probably due to the\r\nfact that Smith had a \"revelation\" which gave him the exact measurements\r\nand proportions. The size upon the ground is eighty feet by sixty, and\r\nthe eastern gable runs up into a square tower, surmounted by a domed\r\nbelfry, to the height of one hundred and twenty-five feet. Two lofty\r\nstories above a low basement are covered by a shingled roof pierced with\r\ndormer windows. Large Gothic windows of the Henry VIII. shape are filled\r\nwith seven-by-nine glass, and afford relief to the solid walls of stone\r\nand stucco that have so well survived the ravages of nearly half a\r\ncentury, though the iron rust streaking the exterior, the moss-grown\r\nshingles, the wasps' nests under the eaves, and the two immense chimneys\r\nalready tottering to their fall, give evidence of approaching ruin.\r\n\r\nAs much as this even the careless passer-by cannot well avoid seeing.\r\nThe more patient and accurate visitor may readily repeat my own\r\nexperience as I went in search of the key on a bleak day in December.\r\n\"The people ought to fix it up,\" said one informant: \"it is a good thing\r\nfor Kirtland;\" the force of which remark I did not realize till I called\r\nupon an old Mormon woman who was said to have the keys. Inquiry at her\r\nlittle cabin resulted in my being directed to \"go to Electy Stratton's.\"\r\nThe latter personage, my cicerone, stated that her parents were\r\nMormons--that her father had spent several hundred dollars in the cause;\r\nand so \"it was thought best that their family should have the keys for a\r\nwhile now.\" The small fee for visiting the Temple was the \"good thing\r\nfor Kirtland,\" and the custody of the keys was not to remain long in one\r\nfamily. Opening a rickety gate, we entered the churchyard. High aloft,\r\njust under the pediment, I could read this inscription in golden letters\r\nupon a white tablet: \"House of the Lord, built by the Church of Christ,\r\n1834.\" Instead of the words \"of Christ\" the original inscription read\r\n\"of the Latter-Day Saints.\" The Temple faces the east. Solid green\r\ndoors, with oval panels, open into a vestibule extending across the\r\nentire front, and terminating on either hand in a semicircular stairway.\r\nThe ceiling is cut away from the front wall to allow a flood of light to\r\nenter from a huge square window above, and the open space is railed off\r\nlike a steamer's cabin. At the right, under the stairway, is the \"Temple\r\nRegister Room,\" containing a record of visitors. On the left is the\r\n\"Library,\" with a curious collection of whale-oil chandeliers. On the\r\nleft of the wall, parallel with the front, is the \"Gentlemen's\r\nEntrance:\" on the right is the \"Ladies' Entrance.\" Between these doors\r\nare the inscriptions: \"Laus Deo,\" \"Crux mihianchora,\" \"Magna veritas, et\r\nprevalebit.\" The auditorium occupies all the rest of the first story,\r\nbut one could wish that the wall which divided it from the vestibule\r\nneed not have spoiled one of the beautiful windows at either end, thus\r\nleaving an ungainly half window in the auditorium. A row of wooden\r\npillars on either side gives the effect of galleries as the room is\r\nentered, but a closer view shows that the space between the rows is\r\narched toward the centre of the ceiling. One of the pillars contains a\r\nwindlass, which in former times controlled the heavy canvas curtains\r\nfrom above. The larger curtain fell into grooves between the high-back\r\npews in such a manner as to separate the men from the women: the smaller\r\ncurtains, at right angles to the other, divided both the men and the\r\nwomen into separate classrooms. Thus the audience was quartered or\r\nhalved at pleasure, and the whole audience was enabled to face either\r\nwestward or eastward by simply changing the movable benches from one\r\nside of the pews to the other. Clusters of richly-carved pulpits, rising\r\nby threes, in three tiers, fill up either end of the room. The eastern\r\ncluster is devoted to the Aaronic Priesthood, which also includes the\r\nLevitical Priesthood, and administered the temporal affairs of the\r\nChurch. Each of the three pulpits in the upper tier has upon the front\r\nthe letters \"B.P.A.,\" meaning Bishop Presiding over Aaronic Priesthood;\r\nthe middle tier has the letters \"P.A.P.,\" Presiding Aaronic Priest; the\r\nlower tier has the letters \"P.A.T.,\" Presiding Aaronic Teacher; a\r\nsmaller pulpit below is labelled \"P.A.D.,\" Presiding Aaronic Doorkeeper.\r\nThe pulpits against the western end are built up against an outer\r\nwindow, with alternate panes of red and white glass in the arched\r\ntransom. These pulpits were occupied by the spiritual leaders, or the\r\nMelchisedec Priesthood, Joe Smith's seat being in the highest tier. This\r\ntier of pulpits is marked \"M.P.C.,\" Melchisedec President of\r\nCounsellors; the middle tier is marked \"P.M.H.,\" Melchisedec Presiding\r\nHigh Priest; the lower tier is \"M.H.P.,\" Melchisedec High Priest.\r\nCurtains from above were arranged to come down between the different\r\ntiers of the priesthood, but so arranged that while those of one degree\r\nmight shut themselves away from the audience \"for consultation,\" they\r\ncould not hide themselves from their superiors in ecclesiastical rank.\r\nStrings and nails in the ceiling are the only remnants of these\r\nremarkable partitions. A simple desk below the Melchisedec pulpit bears\r\nthe title \"M.P.E.,\" Melchisedec Presiding Elder. The letters are in red\r\ncurtain-cord, and the desk itself, like all the pulpits above, is\r\ncovered with green calico. In the days of the Temple's glory rich velvet\r\nupholstery set off all the carved work of the pulpits, and golden\r\nletters shone from spots which are now simply marked by black paint. The\r\ngilt mouldings which formerly set off the plain white finish of the\r\nwoodwork were first despoiled by the vandals, and then entirely removed\r\nby the faithful to prevent further destruction. These mottoes still\r\nremain upon the walls: \"No cross, no crown;\" \"The Lord reigneth, let His\r\npeople rejoice;\" and \"Great is our Lord, and of great power.\" Over the\r\narched window behind the ten Melchisedec pulpits, and just beneath the\r\nvertical modillion which forms the keystone of the ornamental wooden\r\narch, is the text, \"Holiness unto the Lord.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the auditorium to-day--a room which will comfortably hold six\r\nhundred people, but which was often packed so full that relays of\r\nworshippers came and went during a single service. The high pews in the\r\ncorners were for the best singers in Israel; and in one of these pews,\r\nthe natives assert, an insane woman was in the habit of rising and\r\ntooting on a horn whenever the sentiments of the officiating minister\r\ndid not meet with her approval. Smith was in the habit of announcing\r\nfrom his lofty pulpit, \"The truth is good enough without dressing up,\r\nbut Brother Rigdon will now proceed to dress it up.\"\r\n\r\nOver the auditorium is a similar room with lower ceilings and plainer\r\npulpits, each marked with initials which it would be tiresome to\r\nexplain. This hall was used as a school of the prophets where Latin and\r\nHebrew were taught. Marks of the desks remain, but the desks themselves\r\nhave long since been carried away, and the hall has been used for an Odd\r\nFellows' lodge and for various social purposes. On one of the pillars is\r\nthis remarkable announcement: \"THE SALT LAKE MORMONS.--When Joseph Smith\r\nwas killed on June 27, 1844, Brigham Young _assumed_ the _leadership_ of\r\nthe Church, telling the people in the winter of _1846_ that all the\r\n_God_ they wanted _was him_, and all the _Bible_ they wanted was in\r\n_his_ heart. He led or drove about two thousand people to Utah in 1847,\r\nstarting for Upper California and landing at _Salt Lake_, where, in\r\n1852, Brigham Young presented the _Polygamic Revelation_(?) to the\r\npeople. The _True_ Church remained disorganized till 1860, when Joseph\r\nSmith took the leadership or Presidency of _the_ Church at Amboy,\r\nIllinois. _We_ (thirty thousand) have no affiliation with the _Mormons_\r\nwhatever. They are to us an _apostate_ people, _working all manner of\r\nabomination_ before _God_ and man. We are no part or parcel of them in\r\n_any sense whatever_. Let this _be distinctly_ understood: _we are not\r\nMormons_. Truth is truth, wherever it is found.\"\r\n\r\nIn the vestibule of the Temple there is a photograph of Joseph Smith,\r\nJr., and over it is the inscription, \"Joseph Smith, Jr., M.P.C.\r\nPresident of the _Re_-organized Church of J.C. of L.D.S. He resides at\r\nPlano, Kendall county, Illinois.\" Mr. Smith, who is a son of the\r\nprophet, was born in Kirtland November 6, 1832. He removed with his\r\nparents to Missouri and Illinois, and was in his twelfth year when his\r\nfather was killed at Nauvoo. He was a farmer, a school-director and\r\njustice of the peace. Removing to Canton, Illinois, he studied law, and\r\nhas held various city offices. In 1860 he began to preach Mormonism\r\naccording to the notice nailed on the pillar of the Temple. In 1866 he\r\nremoved to Plano to take charge of _The Latter-Day Saints' Herald_, a\r\nposition which he still retains, in connection with the presidency of\r\nthe Church. Under date of December 23, 1879, Mr. Smith writes: \"I am now\r\npretty widely recognized as the leader of that wing of the Mormon Church\r\ndeclaring primitive Mormonism, but denying and opposing polygamy and\r\nUtah Mormonism.... We hope they [the Utah Mormons] are waning in power.\r\nWe are maintaining an active ministry in Utah, striving to show the\r\npeople there their errors.... It is not my province to state whether the\r\nChurch will return to Kirtland or not.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Mr. Smith's further statements it seems that the various\r\nsects--such as Rigdonites, Strangites, etc.--into which the Mormons were\r\nbroken after leaving Kirtland are very few in numbers and very widely\r\nscattered. His reformed Church believes in the Trinity, future\r\npunishment, the laying on of hands, an organization like the primitive\r\nChurch, continued revelations, single marriages, and the creed of most\r\northodox churches relating to the atonement and the ordinances of the\r\ngospel. The title to the Church property at Kirtland is now in Mr. Smith\r\nand a Mr. Forscutt, who derived their title through a Mr. Huntley, the\r\npurchaser under a mortgage sale against the prophet. Proceedings to\r\nremove the cloud from the title are now in the Ohio courts. \"It is\r\nbelieved,\" writes Mr. Smith, \"that the real title is in the Church, and\r\nnot in Joseph Smith as an individual nor in his legal heirs or\r\nassignees.\"\r\n\r\nThe space under the roof is utilized by a series of school-rooms, each\r\nwith falling plastering and \"ratty\" floors. Here the young Mormons were\r\ntaught to ascend the Hill of Science by trudging up some scores of steps\r\nseveral times a day. Strange and dark cubbyholes stare at the visitor\r\nfrom all sides. In one of these was kept the body of Joseph, the son of\r\nJacob, known by a roll of papyrus which was found in his hand. Joe Smith\r\ntranslated the characters on the roll, being favored with a \"special\r\nrevelation\" whenever any of the characters were missing by reason of the\r\nmutilation of the roll.\r\n\r\nStill up the stairway within a small square tower, now without a bell,\r\nI thrust my way until a little trap-door allowed an egress. But the\r\nrailing had gone, and I clung to the belfry-blinds while I surveyed the\r\ncold waters of Lake Erie on the north, the rise of Little Mountain on\r\nthe south, and, between them the broad tract of rolling country divided\r\nby the Chagrin River. I descended through labyrinthine passages, and\r\ncame again to the ground and to the outer air with a sense of relief\r\nafter my two hours' sojourn within the Mormon Temple.\r\n\r\n  FREDERIC G. MATHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] On a scorching day in July I visited Susquehanna to obtain an\r\nauthentic narrative from several parties who were eye-witnesses of the\r\nevents which they related. At the residence of Mrs. Elizabeth Squires I\r\nfound both herself and Mrs. Sally McKune, the widow of Joseph McKune.\r\nMrs. Squires is considerably over seventy, and Mrs. McKune is about\r\neighty, years of age. Both these ladies lived in the neighborhood at the\r\ntime of the Smith manifestations. The statement given above with regard\r\nto the digging for treasure is that of Mrs. McKune, supplemented by Mrs.\r\nSquires. Jacob J. Skinner, the present owner of the farm, was about\r\nsixteen years old at the time of the search. For a number of years he\r\nhas been engaged in filling the holes with stone to protect his cattle,\r\nbut the boys still use the north-east hole as a swimming-pond in the\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\n[3] Among the callers was Samuel Brush, now a vigorous man of\r\nseventy-five, who carries on a large farm and a lumber-mill three miles\r\nsouth-west of Susquehanna. At the time of the translation he often\r\ncalled Reuben Hale away from his work, and the pair went for a walk.\r\nReuben also explained the phenomenon of the peek-stone on the theory of\r\n\"deflected light.\" Mr. Brush declares that Martin Harris was a believer\r\nin \"second sight,\" and that \"Smith was a good and kind\r\nneighbor\"--testimony which is also given by Mrs. McKune, Mrs. Squires\r\nand Mr. Skinner.\r\n\r\n[4] A note of inquiry has elicited from this sole survivor of the\r\noriginal \"three witnesses\" the information that he has this manuscript.\r\nPerhaps he may yet startle the Mormon world by publishing a _facsimile_\r\nedition of the original \"translation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA VENGEANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    From savage pass and rugged shore\r\n        The noise of angry hosts had fled,\r\n    The bitter battle raged no more\r\n        Where fiery bolts had wrought their scars,\r\n      And where the dying and the dead\r\n    In many a woeful heap were flung,\r\n    While night above the AEgean hung\r\n        Its melancholy maze of stars.\r\n\r\n    One boyish Greek, of princely line,\r\n      Lay splashed with blood and wounded sore;\r\n      His wan face in its anguish bore\r\n    The delicate symmetry divine\r\n      Carved by the old sculptors of his land;\r\n      A broken blade was in his hand,\r\n    Half slipping from the forceless hold\r\n      That once had swayed it long and well;\r\n      And round his form in tatters fell\r\n    The velvet raiment flowered with gold.\r\n\r\n    But while the calm night later grew\r\n      He heard the stealthy, rustling sound\r\n        Of one who trailed on laggard knees\r\n      A shattered shape along the ground;\r\n    And soon with sharp surprise he knew\r\n      That in the encircling gloom profound\r\n        A fierce Turk crawled by slow degrees\r\n    To where in helpless pain he lay.\r\n    Then, too, he witnessed with dismay\r\n\r\n    That from the prone Turk's rancorous eye\r\n        Flashed the barbaric lurid trace\r\n      Of hate's indomitable hell--\r\n      Such hate as death alone could quell,\r\n    As death alone could satisfy.\r\n\r\n    Closer the loitering figure drew,\r\n      With naked bosom red from fight,\r\n      With ruthless fingers clutching tight\r\n    A dagger stained by murderous hue,\r\n    Till now, in one great lurch, he threw\r\n      His whole frame forward, aiming quick\r\n        A deadly, inexorable blow,\r\n    That, weakly faltering, missed its mark,\r\n      And left the assassin breathing thick,\r\n        Levelled by nerveless overthrow,\r\n    There near the Greek chief, in the dark.\r\n\r\n    Then he that saw the baffled crime,\r\n      Half careless of his life's release,\r\n        Since death must win him soon as prey,\r\n    Turned on his foe a smile sublime\r\n      With pity, and the stars of Greece\r\n        Beheld him smile, and only they.\r\n\r\n    All night the two lay side by side,\r\n      Each near to death, yet living each;\r\n    All night the grim Turk moaned and cried,\r\n        Beset with pangs of horrid thirst,\r\n      Save when his dagger crept to reach,\r\n    By wandering, ineffectual way,\r\n    The prostrate Greek he yearned to slay,\r\n        And failure stung him till he cursed.\r\n\r\n    But when soft prophecies of morn\r\n      Had wrapped the sea in wistful white,\r\n    A band of men, with faces worn,\r\n      Clomb inland past a beetling height\r\n    To find the young chief they adored,\r\n      Sought eagerly since fall of sun,\r\n    And now in ghastly change restored....\r\n        One raised a torch of ruddy shine,\r\n      And, kneeling by their leader, one\r\n        Set to his mouth a gourd of wine.\r\n\r\n    Then the young Greek, with wave of hand,\r\n      Showed the swart pagan at his side;\r\n    So, motioning to the gathered band,\r\n    That none could choose but understand,\r\n      \"Let this man drink,\" he said, and died.\r\n\r\n    EDGAR FAWCETT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUDIES IN THE SLUMS.\r\n\r\nIV.--JACK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I've never told the whole straight ahead, ma'am. The Lord knows it all,\r\nan' there've been times I couldn't ha' done it, an' wouldn't ha' done it\r\nif I could ha' helped it. For, you see, in spite of the deviltry I never\r\nquite got rid of the sense that God sat lookin' at me, an' that, I do\r\nsuppose, came from what stuck to me, whether or no, in the school. An'\r\nyou'd wonder that anything stuck or could.\r\n\r\n\"I'll begin at the beginnin'. Drink? No, it wasn't _my_ drinkin'. You'd\r\nthink that must ha' been it, but it wasn't, for all I came up in the\r\nFourth Ward--the only sober bartender the ward ever see, or ever will\r\nsee, I reckon.\r\n\r\n\"The very first thing that ever I remember is my mother dead drunk on\r\nthe floor. I thought it was dead without the drunk, an' stood screamin';\r\nan' my father come up an' some of the neighbors. We was all respectable\r\nthen, an' one of them says, 'The Lord help you, Mr. Brown! She's begun\r\nag'in.' He didn't speak, but just lifted her up an' put her on the bed,\r\nand then he sat down and covered up his face with his hands, an' was so\r\nstill I thought he was dead too. I crawled up to him whimperin', an' he\r\nlifted me up.\r\n\r\n\"'Jack,' he says, 'my heart's broke. It's no use: she's bound to go to\r\nthe bad, an' maybe you'll take after her.'\r\n\r\n\"I screamed ag'in, though I didn't know what that meant, but he hushed\r\nme. 'Jack,' he said, 'you're a little fellow, an' your troubles ain't\r\nbegun yet. I'd give my life this minute to take you with me.' He held me\r\nup to him tight an' took my breath, so 't I couldn't ask him where; an'\r\nthen he cried.\r\n\r\n\"That was the beginnin' of me, if gettin' a gleam of sense means\r\nbeginnin' for folks; for, though I didn't know what it all meant, I did\r\nknow he wanted comfort bad as I did, an' we hugged up to one another.\r\nBut I know now all the ins and the outs, for I was told by one that knew\r\nthem both.\r\n\r\n\"She was a pretty girl in a mill in Fall River--fast, like some of them,\r\nbut with an innocent face an' big blue eyes, like a child's, to the very\r\nlast. Many's the time I've seen 'em with no more sense, nor as much, as\r\na baby's in 'em. He was a young shoemaker, that fell in love with the\r\npretty face, an' married her out of hand then an' there, an' took her to\r\nNew York, where he'd got a good place--foreman in a factory. His folks\r\nlived in Fall River, and hers off somewheres. I haven't never seen any\r\nof 'em, an' good reason not to want to.\r\n\r\n\"She liked fine clothes, an' thought she was goin' to be a lady an' do\r\nnothin'; an' when the first baby come it was a bother to her, for she\r\nwasn't strong, an' one of the neighbors told her to drink beer. There's\r\nno use spinnin' it out. It began with beer, but it ended with whiskey,\r\nan' the first my father ever knew was the dead baby that she'd killed\r\nrollin' over on it in a drunken sleep.\r\n\r\n\"That cured her for a year. She was afraid of my father, for at first,\r\nin his fury, he swore he'd give her up to the officers; an' then she\r\ncried so, an' went on day after day, till he couldn't but be sorry for\r\nher ag'in. An' then I come along--many's the time I've cursed the\r\nday--an' till I was four all was well enough. Then it came. She'd been\r\ntakin' a little slyly a good while, but nobody knew till it got to be\r\ntoo much for her ag'in. It was partly trouble, I will say, for my father\r\nwas weakly an' goin' with consumption, an' she was fond of him. But this\r\ntime there was no stoppin' her. She'd pawn everything: she's taken the\r\njacket off me in a winter's day an' sent me with it to the pawnbroker's,\r\nan' I not darin' not to go. To the last minute my father did what he\r\ncould. I was six when he died, an' he'd dress me himself an' try to\r\nkeep me decent. She was drunk the very night he died, an' not a soul\r\nnear. I sat on the bed an' looked at him. 'Jack,' he said, 'hate whiskey\r\nlong as you live: it's killed me, an' it'll kill your mother. It's a\r\ndevil.'\r\n\r\n\"There was a saloon under us then. We had got lower and lower, for, fix\r\nup as father might, there was never any surety he wouldn't find things\r\nsmashed or sold out; an' at last there wasn't anything to sell. An' when\r\nhe was gone I can't remember as I ever see her sober. I got to hate the\r\nsmell of it so it sickened me. It does now, though it was my trade to\r\nsell the stuff, an' I never minded that.\r\n\r\n\"I lost track of her. I was a newsboy an' lookin' out for myself when I\r\nwas eight, an' sometimes I'd hunt her up, an' she'd hug me an' go on\r\nover me if she wasn't too drunk; but mostly I didn't. I might ha' been\r\nrespectable enough, for I liked my work, but I got in with a set of boys\r\nthat had learned to pick pockets. It was good fun. I had quick ways, an'\r\nthe first time I ever hauled out a handkerchief I thought it about the\r\nsmartest game anybody could play. It's more for the excitement of it,\r\nhalf the time, than from real native cussedness, that boys begin; an' I\r\ndidn't think one way or another. But the time come when I did think. I\r\nwas caught with fellows that had been up half a dozen times, an' because\r\nI was little they sent me to the house of refuge.\r\n\r\n\"Now, I ain't goin' to say more'n I can help about that, for there was\r\none man I sha'n't ever forget. He's dead now, but he meant work with\r\nthem boys, an' he did it. I believe he loved 'em every one just because\r\nthey had souls. But what I do say is, that, far's I know, eight boys out\r\no' ten come out worse'n when they went in. Why not? They're mostly the\r\nworst sort, an' it's a kind of rivalry amongst them which'll tell the\r\nmost deviltry. There ain't a trick nor turn you can't be put up to, an'\r\nI learned 'em every one. I learned some other things too. We had to\r\nstudy some, an' I was quick, an' I learned Bible-verses so well they\r\nthought I was a crack scholar; an' we all laughed, thinkin' how easy\r\nyou can humbug a teacher. But the last year I was wild to get away an'\r\ntry my hand at some of the new kinks I'd learned. I was fourteen and\r\nfull grown, so't I was always taken for twenty; an' I thought I was a\r\nman, sure. I run away twice, an' was brought back, an' it went hard with\r\nme, for they flogged me each time so't I couldn't stir for a week.\r\n\r\n\"At last time was up. I'd made up my mind what to do: I'd settled it by\r\nthat time that everybody was ready to humbug, an' the pious-talkin' ones\r\nworst of all, for I'd seen some that I'd spotted in lies many a time.\r\nThe first thing I did was to chuck away the Bible they'd given me an'\r\nmake straight for Micky Hagan's. You don't know what that means? I'll\r\ntell you. Micky Hagan's was one of the receivin'-places for\r\nriver-thievin'. He had boats to let, an' bought out an' out or advanced\r\non the swag, just as you pleased; an' mostly you're in his debt, because\r\nyou get into the way of swappin', an' he sets his own price on the thing\r\nyou fancy.\r\n\r\n\"Now, I've thought it all out, ma'am, many a time. If there'd been\r\nanybody to take hold of us in the right way I don't believe we should\r\nhave come out as we did. I wasn't bad all through then: I mean, I was\r\nready to do a good turn if I could, an' bound for a lark anyhow. But\r\nwe'd smuggled in novels and story-papers till our heads was full of what\r\nfine things we'd do. They didn't give us better things. There was\r\nbooks--yes, plenty of 'em--but mostly long-winded stuff about fellers\r\nthat died young, bein' too good for this world. There wasn't anybody to\r\ntell us we'd a right to some fun, and the Lord meant us to enjoy life,\r\nnor to get us busy in some way that would take our minds off real\r\nwickedness. These preachers hadn't ever been boys: they'd been born in\r\ntheir white chokers, I believe, an' knew no more of real human nature\r\nthan they did of common sense. If I had a boy growin' up I'd keep him\r\nhard at something, an' try an' have him like it, too. A boy don't mind\r\nwork if there's anything he can see to be got by it. Why, see how I did.\r\nAt fifteen out all night long, up an' down the river, schemin' all ways\r\nto circumvent the watchmen, for they're that 'cute it needs all your\r\nbrains an' more to get ahead of 'em. You see, a ship'll come in an'\r\nunload partly, an' there's two or three days they're on the keen lookout\r\ntill they're nigh empty; an' then's the best time for light\r\nplunder--ropes an' such. But I went in for reg'lar doin's--bags of\r\ncoffee or spice, or anything goin'. We had a dodge for a good while they\r\ncouldn't make out--goin' along soft, oars muffled, hardly drawin' a long\r\nbreath, till we'd got under the dock, where I'd seen the coffee-bags\r\nlie, an' a man on 'em with pistol cocked. Then, slow an' easy, bore with\r\na big auger up through them beams and straight into the bag, an' the\r\ncoffee'd pour down into the bag we held under. Went off with seven bags\r\nthat very way one night, an' I was that full of laugh! I walked back\r\ndown the dock when we'd landed 'em, an' saw the watchman jest dancin'\r\nan' swearin', he was so mad.\r\n\r\n\"'What's up?' I says, innocent as could be, goin' up to him.\r\n\r\n\"'It's them d---- river-thieves,' he says, 'with a new kink,----'em!\r\nI'll be even with 'em yet. Here's seven holes right up through, an' the\r\nLord only knows how they could do it an' I not hear 'em. They're that\r\nthick I believe there's one to every bag of coffee on ship or off; but\r\nI'll get 'em yet.' He looked at me sharp as a rat, but I kept my face\r\nstraight till I'd walked off, an' then I believe I laughed a day without\r\nstoppin'.\r\n\r\n\"That went on three years. I'd got to think no man alive could take me,\r\nfor I'd been grabbed a dozen times, an' always slipped out somehow. I'd\r\nbeen shot at, an' hit twice; been knocked overboard, an' swum under the\r\ndock--'most froze an' stiff with ice before I could get out. An' then to\r\nthink that it was only a coil of rope took me at last! I thought 'twas\r\nspices, but the captain'd been too quick for us, an' every bag was in\r\nthe government storehouse. I crawled up the side like a cat an' felt\r\nround, mad enough to find only that rope; an' I'd just dropped it over\r\nthe side when there was a light, an' three men on me. I dropped, but\r\nthey had me. I fought like mad, but the handcuffs were on, an' I was\r\nmarched off quicker'n I can tell it. An' one was the very man that had\r\nsworn to be even with us, an' he knew me on the spot. That trial didn't\r\ntake long. 'In consideration of my youth,' the judge said, I was to have\r\n'only ten years.' Only ten years! He didn't know how it looked to me,\r\nthat loved my own life an' freedom so't I couldn't bear a house over me\r\neven a day, but must be out in the air. I swore I'd kill whoever took\r\nme, an' I fought with the keeper till they chained me like a wild beast;\r\nan' that's the way I went to Sing-Sing, an' all warned they'd got the\r\ndevil's own to deal with.\r\n\r\n\"There was six months I fought: there wasn't a week I wasn't up for\r\npunishment. Do you know what that means? It's better now, they say. Then\r\nit meant the shower-bath till you fainted dead, an' when you came to,\r\nput back to have it ag'in. It meant the leather collar an' jacket, an'\r\nyour head wellnigh cut off when, half dead, you had to let it drop a\r\nbit. It meant kicks an' cuffs an' floggin's an' half rations. I was down\r\nto skin an' bone. 'You're goin', sure, Jack,' I said; an' then I said,\r\n'What's the use? Behave yourself an' maybe you'll get pardoned out, or,\r\nbetter yet, maybe you'll get away.'\r\n\r\n\"It was tough work. I hated that keeper so't I could have brained him\r\njoyfully any minute. I'd set my teeth when he came near, for the\r\nmurder'd run down my arms till my hands twitched an' tingled to get at\r\nhim. I swore I'd kill him if I ever got a chance to do it quietly, for\r\nhe'd treated us worse than dogs. But I mended my ways. It took a year of\r\nhard work before I could hold on to myself. I'd get a sight at the sky\r\nwhen we crossed the yard, an' my heart was up in my throat every time.\r\nOh, to be out! If only I could be on the river ag'in an' smell the salt\r\nan' feel the wind! I've lain on my floor in the cell many a night an'\r\ncried like a baby for only ten minutes' freedom. I'm that way yet:\r\nthere's wild blood in me from somewhere, an' I'd make a better Indian\r\nthan white man any day.\"\r\n\r\nJack's restless motions were the best proof of his theory. As his story\r\nbegan he had sat quietly in the little mission-parlor, but now he was\r\nwalking hastily up and down, stopping a moment at some special point,\r\nthen starting again--a tall, lean figure, with characteristic New\r\nEngland face, very thin now, and with a hectic flush on the sunken\r\ncheeks, but shrewd and kindly--the narrow chin and high cheek-bones,\r\nprominent nose and soft thin hair, seeming to belong wholly to the type\r\nof New England villager, and by no possibility to the rough and\r\ndesperate native of the Fourth Ward. Born in his own place on some quiet\r\ninland farm, he would have turned peddler, or, nearer the sea, have\r\nchosen that for his vocation; but it was impossible to look upon him as\r\nan ex-convict or to do away with the impression of respectability which\r\nseems part of the New England birthright.\r\n\r\n\"At last,\" he went on, \"things changed. A new chaplain came, for one\r\nthing, an' I'd got so quiet they changed my cell an' put me on the other\r\nside the buildin'. I went on in a kind of dream. I worked like two, an'\r\nthey begun to take notice of me. The chaplain 'd come an' talk to me,\r\nan' he worked over me well; but he might as well have talked to the\r\ndead. But my very keepin' still made him think he'd half got me, an'\r\nhe'd fetch books an' papers; an' things got easier that way. I read an'\r\nstudied: I was bound now to know something, an' I worked at that hard as\r\nI did at everything else; an' there come a time when I was recommended\r\nfor pardon, an' five years an' a day after I went in he brought it to\r\nme. I couldn't speak: I could have gone on my knees to him, an' he had\r\nsense to know how I felt.\r\n\r\n\"'Jack,' he said, 'you're very young yet, an' now is your chance. Try to\r\nbe an honest man an' pray for help. I wish I knew if you will pray.'\r\n\r\n\"'You'd make me if any one could,' I says, 'but I ain't sure of the use\r\nof it yet: I wish I was.'\r\n\r\n\"He just looked at me sorrowful, for I hadn't said even that much\r\nbefore, an' I went off.\r\n\r\n\"An' I did mean to keep straight. I'd had enough of prison; but when I\r\nwent round askin' for work, not a soul would have me. A\r\njail-bird!--well, they thought not. I grew mad ag'in, an' yet I wouldn't\r\ntake to the river, for, somehow, I'd lost my courage. Then I met an old\r\npal, an' he took me round to Micky's saloon. The barkeeper'd just been\r\nstuck in a fight. I'd been a profitable one for Micky, an' maybe he\r\nthought, beginnin' there, I'd go back to the river once more. An' there\r\nI was three years, an' fights nigh every night of the year. I could stop\r\n'em when no one else could, for I was always sober.\r\n\r\n\"'Why don't you drink?' they'd say, an' I'd tell 'em I wanted what\r\nbrains I had unfuddled. But I hated it worse an' worse. I'd have stopped\r\nany minute if there'd been one alive to take me by the hand an' say,\r\n'Here's honest work.' I looked at folks when I went out, to see if there\r\nwas one that could be spoken to. An' at last I made up my mind for\r\nanother try. I'd saved some money an' could live a while, an' one\r\nSaturday night I just left when Micky paid me. 'Get another man,' I\r\nsaid: 'I'm done;' an' I walked out, with him shoutin' after me.\r\n\r\n\"Then I waited three months. I answered advertisements, an' I put 'em\r\nin. I went here an' I went there, an' always it was the same story, for\r\nI answered every one square. An' at last I was sick of it all: I had\r\nnothing to live for. 'I'm tired of living with rascals,' I said, 'an'\r\ngood folks are too good to have anything to do with me. I've had all I\r\nwant. If work don't come in a week I'll get out of this the easiest\r\nway.'\r\n\r\n\"It didn't come. My money was gone: I'd gone hungry two days. I'd been\r\non half rations before that, till my strength was all gone: I'd pawned\r\nmy clothes till I wasn't decent. Then I hadn't a cent even for a place\r\non the floor in a lodgin'-house, an' I sat in the City Hall Park long as\r\nthey would let me. Then, when I was tired of bein' rapped over the head,\r\nI got up an' walked down Beekman street to the river--slow, for I was\r\ntoo far gone to move fast. But as I got nearer something seemed to pull\r\nme on: I began to run. 'It's the end of all trouble,' I said; an' I\r\nwent across like a shot an' down the docks. It was bright moonlight, an'\r\nI had sense to jump for a dark place where the light was cut off; an'\r\nthat's all I remember. I must have hit my head ag'inst a boat, for when\r\nthey took me out it was for dead. Two of my old pals hauled me out, an'\r\nworked there on the dock to bring me to, till the ambulance come an'\r\ntook me to Bellevue.\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't have lived, but I didn't know enough not to, bein' in a\r\nfever a month. Then I come out of it dazed an' stupid, an' it wasn't\r\ntill I'd been there six weeks that I got my senses fairly an' knew I was\r\nalive after all.\r\n\r\n\"'I'll do it better next time,' I said, bein' bound to get out of it\r\nstill; but that night a man in the bed next me began to talk an' ask\r\nabout it. I told him the whole. When I got through he says, 'I don't\r\nknow but one man in New York that'll know just what to do, an' that's\r\nMcAuley of Water street. You go there soon's you can stir an' tell him.'\r\n\r\n\"I laughed. 'I'm done tellin',' I said.\r\n\r\n\"'Try him,' he says; an' he was that urgent that I promised. I'd ha'\r\ngiven a hand if I hadn't, though.\r\n\r\n\"I went out, tremblin' an' sick, an' without a spot to lay my head; an'\r\nright there I stood by the river an' thought it would come easier this\r\ntime. But I'd never go back on my word, an' so I started down, crawlin'\r\nalong, an' didn't get there till meetin' had begun. I didn't know what\r\nsort of a place it was.\r\n\r\n\"It was new then, in an old rookery of a house, but the room clean an'\r\ndecent, an' just a little sign out, 'HELPING HAND FOR MEN.' I sat an'\r\nlistened an' wondered till it was over, an' then tried to go, but first\r\nI knew I tumbled in a dead faint an' was bein' taken up stairs. They\r\nmade me a bed next their own room. 'You'd better not,' I said: 'I'm a\r\njail-bird an' a rascal, an' nobody alive wants to have anything to do\r\nwith me.'\r\n\r\n\"'You be quiet,' says Jerry. 'I'm a jail-bird myself, but the Lord Jesus\r\nhas forgiven me an' made me happy; an' He'll do the same by you.'\r\n\r\n\"They kept me there a week, an' you'd think I was their own, the way\r\nthey treated me. But I stuck it out: 'When I see a man that's always\r\nbeen respectable come to me an' give me work, an' say he's not afraid or\r\nashamed to, then maybe I'll believe in your Lord Jesus Christ you talk\r\nabout; but how am I goin' to without?'\r\n\r\n\"An' that very night it came. You know him well--the gentleman that\r\nlooks as if the wind had never blown rough on him, an' yet with an eye\r\nthat can't be fooled.\r\n\r\n\"'You don't need to tell me a word,' he says: 'I believe you are honest,\r\nan' you can begin to-morrow if you're strong enough. It's light work,\r\nan' it shall be made easier at first.'\r\n\r\n\"I looked at him, an' it seemed to me something that had frozen me all\r\nup inside melted that minute. I burst out cryin', an' couldn't stop. An'\r\nthen, first thing I knew, he was down on his knees prayin' for me. 'Dear\r\nLord,' he said, 'he is Thy child, he has always been Thy child. Make him\r\nknow it to-night: make him know that Thy love has followed him and will\r\nhold him up, so that his feet will never slip again.'\r\n\r\n\"These words stayed by me. I couldn't speak, an' he went away. He knew\r\nwhat he'd done.\r\n\r\n\"That's all. Some of the men shake their heads: they say it wasn't\r\nregular conversion. All I know is, the sense of God come into me then,\r\nan' it's never left me. It keeps me on the watch for every soul in\r\ntrouble. I'm down on the docks o' nights. I know the signs, an' now an'\r\nthen I can help one that's far gone. I'm goin' myself, you see. There\r\nain't much left of me but a cough an' some bones, but I shall be up to\r\nthe last. God is that good to me that I'll go quick when I do go; but,\r\nquick or slow, I bless Him every hour of the day for the old mission an'\r\nmy chance.\"\r\n\r\n  HELEN CAMPBELL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWESTBROOK.\r\n\r\n\r\nRuth looked very warm and tired as she came up the path in the strong\r\nsunlight; and in striking contrast to her sat Miss Custer in the\r\nsheltered veranda, with her cool gray draperies flowing about her in the\r\nmost graceful folds that could be imagined, as though a sculptor's hand\r\nhad arranged them. Her dress was cut so as to disclose her white throat\r\nrising, swan-like, above a ruffling of soft yellow lace; and her\r\nsleeves, flaring a little and short enough to reveal a good deal of the\r\nexquisitely-moulded arms, were edged with the same costly trimming,\r\nthrowing a creamy shadow on the white skin and giving it a tinge like\r\nivory.\r\n\r\nMiss Custer liked being considered a brunette, and directed all the arts\r\nof her toilette to the bringing out of that idea. She had not much to\r\ncommence with, however. Her eyes were brown, it is true, but they were a\r\nsort of amber-brown, large and serene, with dusky, long-fringed lids\r\ndrooping over them; and her hair, which was dark in the shadow of the\r\nveranda, all hemmed in with trees in thick foliage, was bright gold in\r\ncertain lights.\r\n\r\nShe was an amply-framed, finely-proportioned person, and rejoiced in her\r\nphysique, having a masculine pride in her breadth of shoulders and depth\r\nof chest. But in all other respects she was exquisitely feminine: she\r\nnever displayed either strength or agility. Westbrook was a country\r\nplace, and in the young folks' rambles about town and out over the hills\r\nshe was more often fatigued than anybody else, and obliged to accept\r\nsupport from some one of the gentlemen, all of whom were eager enough to\r\noffer their services.\r\n\r\nShe had been in Westbrook only two weeks--she had come to rest herself\r\nfrom the burdens of fashionable life--but she was already very much at\r\nhome with the place and the people. She was one of those persons who\r\nimmediately interest the whole neighborhood, and of whom people say,\r\n\"Have you met her? Have you been introduced to her?\"\r\n\r\nShe was not an entire stranger: there were a good many people in\r\nWestbrook who had known her parents years before, and who took her at\r\nonce upon the credit of her family.\r\n\r\nRuth looked tired and warm, I say, as she came up the path. It was after\r\nfour o'clock, and school was just out. She was the teacher of the\r\ngrammar department in the ugly red-brick school-house down at the other\r\nend of the town, and she had had a tiresome walk through the heat.\r\n\r\nMiss Custer dropped her work, some delicate embroidery, in her lap and\r\nfolded her white hands upon it, and smiled down at her. She liked Ruth,\r\nand was glad to see her coming: the afternoon had been rather dull\r\nbecause she was alone, and she was not constituted for solitude.\r\n\r\nDoctor Ebling had said at the dinner-table that, with Ruth's\r\npermission--at which Ruth blushed and said something rather saucy, for\r\nher--he would read _The Spanish Gypsy_ to Miss Custer out in the shade.\r\n\r\n\"It is so confoundedly healthy at this particular season,\" he said,\r\n\"especially up among these Connecticut hills, that a physician's\r\noccupation's gone.\"\r\n\r\nFirst, however, he went down town--going part of the way with Ruth--to\r\nmake sure that no orders were awaiting him at his office, intending to\r\ncome back immediately.\r\n\r\nMiss Custer stepped across the hall from the dining-room into the\r\nsitting-room, made cool by having the blinds closed, and struck a few\r\nchords on the piano. Herbert Bruce, a young attorney of some wealth and\r\nsome renown, and bosom friend of Doctor Ebling, followed her, and stood,\r\nhat in hand, with his shoulder against the door-jamb. \"So you have never\r\nread _The Gypsy_?\" he remarked.\r\n\r\nMiss Custer turned quickly and came a step toward him. \"Oh yes, I have\r\nread it,\" she returned. \"Or, rather, a good many people have read it to\r\nme. But one can stand hearing a poem a good many times, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"By Jove! that's a cooler!\" thought Bruce. \"No doubt she has been bored\r\nto death by that wretched _Gypsy_, and now Ebling is going to martyrize\r\nher again, and make a fool of himself into the bargain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Won't you be seated?\" Miss Custer asked, \"and let me play you\r\nsomething?\"\r\n\r\nIn the shaded room, with her languid eyes intensified, she was a decided\r\nbrunette, and a very brilliant and beautiful one. Mr. Bruce, pleading\r\nbusiness, although he knew there was not a soul stirring down street,\r\nand nothing more to be done in his office than in that of Mortimer\r\nLightwood, Esq., declined rather ungraciously and stalked off.\r\n\r\n\"A born coquette!\" he muttered with his hat pulled over his eyes.\r\n\"Ebling's a fool: Ruth Stanley is worth a dozen of her.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Custer went up stairs and made her afternoon toilette, then got out\r\nher embroidery and came down to her accustomed rustic arm-chair,\r\nsmilingly conscious of the perfection of all that pertained to herself,\r\nfrom the soft ringlets on her broad forehead, so different from the\r\nstiff, frowsy crimps of the country-girls, to the small Newport ties\r\nwith their cardinal-red bows, the only bright color about her. She was\r\njust beginning to wonder what kept the doctor so long, when, raising her\r\neyes from a reverie which had been almost a nap, she saw him driving by\r\nat a fast trot, with a farm-boy galloping on horseback beside him. He\r\nwaved his hand to her.\r\n\r\nJust then Hugh, son and heir of Aunt Ruby, mistress of this Westbrook\r\nboarding-establishment, who had been sent down town after dinner to do\r\nsome marketing, came in at the gate with a basket on his arm, eating an\r\napple. He paused when he came up, and rested himself by putting one foot\r\non the lower step and settling his weight upon the other. \"There's a man\r\nout east bin awfully cut up in a mowin'-machine,\" said he, glancing up\r\nat Miss Custer sideways from under his broad-brimmed straw hat, sure\r\nthat she would appreciate the news, he being the first to tell it; for\r\nhe had a boyish conceit that Miss Custer had a very high opinion of him,\r\nand even indulged the fancy that if he were a man--say\r\ntwenty-one--instead of a youth of seventeen, he could cut out all them\r\ndowntown fellers that hung round her.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! poor man!\" said Miss Custer with a sweetness of sympathy that must\r\nhave comforted the wounded person immensely had he heard it.\r\n\r\n\"Burnses' boy came in for Doc Ebling,\" continued Hugh. \"They don't know\r\nwhether they can patch him up again or not.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose the doctor will find out,\" said Miss Custer complacently; and\r\nHugh flung away his apple-core and walked on around the house.\r\n\r\nMiss Custer hardly knew what to do with herself. She went back to her\r\nroom, and was tempted to lie down, but then it would rumple her dress\r\nand spoil her hair. She thought of the invalid lady, Mrs. Tascher, whose\r\nroom was at the other end of the hall, but she had an uncomfortable\r\nintuition that Mrs. Tascher disliked her. For herself, she disliked\r\nnobody: there were people who were not congenial to her, but she never\r\ntook the trouble to get up a feeling against them. But it seemed to her\r\nMrs. Tascher had not only clearly defined but conscientious likes and\r\ndislikes. She had tried to overcome the opposing current so far as it\r\nconcerned herself, because it was unpleasant; and, although not wholly\r\nunaccountable--for she was conscious of some weaknesses, as most mortals\r\nare--so far as Mrs. Tascher was affected by her shortcomings the\r\nprejudice seemed unfounded. She had never injured her--never, except in\r\nthat large sense in which all good souls are injured by wrong-doing;\r\nwhich large sense Miss Custer, perhaps, had but a dim consciousness of\r\neven when stung--for she was very susceptible--by the criticism, open or\r\nimplied, of certain high, discriminating natures.\r\n\r\nAfter a while she went down to the back regions, and glided in upon the\r\nwhite kitchen-floor with her sweeping skirts.\r\n\r\nAunt Ruby looked up with an exclamation of surprise. She was picking\r\nover raspberries for tea: \"Oh, you oughtn't to come in here, Miss\r\nCuster: you'll spoil your clothes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible,\" said Miss Custer, glancing around at the cleanness of\r\neverything with flattering significance, and seated herself in a low\r\nsplint-bottomed chair.\r\n\r\n\"To be sure, Peggy scrubbed this morning,\" said Aunt Ruby with a feeling\r\nof satisfaction, \"but one can't ever be very sure about a\r\nkitchen-floor.\"\r\n\r\n\"I could always be sure enough of yours to scatter my best things upon\r\nit,\" said Miss Custer, who, wishing to be entertained, was exceedingly\r\ngood-natured; though, for that matter, she was seldom otherwise.\r\n\r\nAunt Ruby, who was greatly taken with the fine-lady boarder who made\r\nherself so common, entertained her better than she thought, for Miss\r\nCuster took a curious interest in most of the people she met, and liked\r\nto study them.\r\n\r\nOf course Aunt Ruby could not spend time for her own or anybody else's\r\namusement merely: when she got through with the raspberries she went at\r\nsomething else, her loose slippers clattering over the floor back and\r\nforth wherever her duty called her. But still, she talked, and Miss\r\nCuster sat looking out into the clean-swept back yard with its boxed-up\r\nflower-beds blooming with the gayest annuals, and its cooped-up hens\r\nwith their broods of puffy chickens scratching and picking and chirping\r\noutside.\r\n\r\n\"Have Doctor Ebling and Miss Stanley been long engaged?\" Miss Custer\r\nasked, the conversation having somehow led up to that query.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, la! yes,\" Aunt Ruby answered--\"for more'n a year. The way of it\r\nwas: Ruth's guardian, Mr. Murray, who was a minister, went off to some\r\nforrin country several years ago to be a missionary, and left Ruth here\r\nto finish her education. He was to send for her to come an' teach in a\r\nmission-school if she wanted to go--an' she al'ays said she did--after\r\nshe'd graduated in the normal. But she came up here to stay a spell\r\nafter graduatin', an' met Doctor Ebling; an' they took a notice to each\r\nother right away, an' were engaged. She wrote to Mr. Murray about it,\r\nan' he gave his consent to the marriage. But it couldn't take place just\r\nyet, for the doctor had only just begun his practice an' wasn't ready to\r\nsettle down.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is, I suppose, he had not sufficient means to set up\r\nhousekeeping?\" said Miss Custer, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"Well, perhaps not in the way he'd like,\" Aunt Ruby returned evasively,\r\nnot being a gossip in the mischievous sense.\r\n\r\n\"And your other gentleman-boarder, Mr. Bruce--\" began Miss Custer, and\r\nthen stopped.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he's got enough money to set up housekeeping like a king,\" said\r\nAunt Ruby, feeling that this was safe ground. \"If he had anybody to set\r\nup with him,\" she added, and laughed at her own wit.\r\n\r\n\"But did Miss Stanley really think of going to teach in a foreign\r\nmission-school?\" Miss Custer asked.\r\n\r\n\"To be sure she did,\" said Aunt Ruby. \"She's a Christian girl, if ever\r\nthere was one. You might look the world over, Miss Custer, an' you'd\r\nhardly find another girl like Ruth Stanley. She's the same as a\r\nmissionary right here at home, because she looks out for every poor an'\r\nsick body in the town, an' spends half her wages to help them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just the sort of person, then, for a doctor's wife,\" laughed Miss\r\nCuster, and gathered up her embroidery to go back to the veranda.\r\n\r\nInstead of going through the dining-room, the way she had entered, she\r\ncrossed over to the door of the back sitting-room, which was ajar, and\r\npushed it open. She started and her cheeks crimsoned, at the\r\nrecollection of her conversation with Aunt Ruby, on finding the\r\nsitting-room occupied.\r\n\r\nMrs. Tascher sat in Aunt Ruby's great arm-chair, with its calico\r\ncushions, looking over some fashion-plates in the carelessly-indolent\r\nway that very warm weather induces. She had some pieces of muslin and a\r\npair of scissors beside her on the table, as though she had been cutting\r\nout. She looked up with a smile that was intended simply as an\r\nexpression of politeness, and not such a smile as she would give a\r\nfriend, and nodded: \"Good-afternoon, Miss Custer.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Custer, feeling herself compromised by having been caught\r\ngossiping--and by Mrs. Tascher, of all people!--fortified herself by a\r\nlittle accession of pride in her usually suave demeanor.\r\n\"Good-afternoon,\" she returned, passing on through the room. \"How\r\nstiflingly warm it is here!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I have been thinking of going into the parlor,\" said Mrs. Tascher:\r\n\"it is always cool there, because the blinds are kept closed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does she say that to prevent my taking refuge in the parlor?\" thought\r\nMiss Custer, and moved on and went outside.\r\n\r\nBy and by some soft piano-strains came through the window, the sash of\r\nwhich was raised, at her back. When they ceased she became conscious,\r\nwithout turning her head to look through the shutters, that Mrs. Tascher\r\nhad seated herself in an easy-chair and taken up a book from the\r\ncentre-table, which held the usual stock of gilt-edged\r\npoems--Whittier's, Tennyson's, etc.\r\n\r\nNearly an hour passed in sultry silence, broken only by the buzzing of\r\nflies and, now and then, a subdued sound of wheels on the sandy road\r\nbelow. At last the gate-latch clicked, and Ruth came in, walking slowly\r\nup the path.\r\n\r\nDoctor Ebling had driven by a few moments before, and gone up the alley\r\nto the stable, and just as Ruth reached the steps, shutting her parasol\r\nand smiling up rather wearily at Miss Custer, he came around the corner\r\nof the house, lifting his hat and wiping the perspiration from his face.\r\n\r\n\"Why, where have you been?\" Ruth asked in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"In the country,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"And just think, Miss Stanley,\" exclaimed Miss Custer, speaking to Ruth,\r\nbut looking a smiling reproach at the doctor, and for a moment\r\nforgetting the parlor occupant at her back, \"here I have been sitting\r\nthis whole blessed afternoon! I could have borne the infliction of my\r\nown solitary company better, of course, if I had not been promised an\r\nentertainment.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must charge your disappointment to a poor fellow who got himself\r\ncut to pieces by a grass-mower,\" said the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"Who was it?\" asked Ruth quickly, with a sympathetic play of facial\r\nmuscles.\r\n\r\n\"A man by the name of Burgess, out east of town.\"\r\n\r\n\"And is he in a bad way?\"\r\n\r\n\"Rather.\"\r\n\r\nRuth stood for a moment with her eyes upon the ground, absorbed in the\r\nthought of a fellow-being in distress, and the doctor, glancing from her\r\nup to Miss Custer, was conscious of the strong contrast between them.\r\n\r\nMiss Custer was ten years Ruth's senior, but just now it looked as if it\r\nmight be the other way: teaching gave Ruth a jaded look that seemed like\r\nage. But she was only eighteen. She wore a plain brown dress and linen\r\ncuffs and collar, all of which bore the stamp of the school-room. Her\r\nshoes were dusty, and her hair, untouched since early morning, had\r\nsettled into a mass at the back of her neck, more artistic than stylish.\r\n\r\nBy and by she excused herself and went into the house. It was her habit\r\nto take a bath and dress herself before tea. The doctor came up and\r\nseated himself on the top step, and remarked that he didn't know whether\r\nit would be worth while to go up town before supper or not. Miss Custer\r\nwas about to persuade him that it would not be worth while, when a\r\nmovement on the part of Mrs. Tascher recalled her to the consciousness\r\nof that lady's proximity and put her under a sort of constraint. \"Do you\r\nsuppose your office to be strewn with orders for your immediate\r\nattendance upon wounded individuals?\" she asked carelessly.\r\n\r\n\"If I thought it was,\" said he, \"I'd make for the woods over yonder and\r\nhide myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unnatural physician! I always supposed medical men to be the most\r\ndevoted to their profession, and the fondest of exercising it, of all\r\nbeings.\"\r\n\r\n\"As to devotion,\" said the doctor, \"I agree with you--we _are_ a devoted\r\nclass. But as to exercise of any description, that is contrary to all\r\nhuman inclination in such a temperature as this.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet Miss Stanley endures it,\" said Miss Custer, and could have\r\nbitten her tongue the next moment.\r\n\r\nA grave expression settled upon the doctor's face. \"Yes,\" said he, \"her\r\nbrave spirit surmounts everything. She is of a different make-up from\r\nall the other people I know. And, by the way, it always seems to me\r\nirrelevant to bring her into comparison with ordinary mortals,\" he\r\nadded; and, getting up and settling his hat upon his head, he strode\r\noff.\r\n\r\nMiss Custer felt a pang of keen regret. \"I have offended him,\" she\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nBut at the supper-table, an hour or two later, there was no evidence of\r\noffence in his attitude toward her, though it must be allowed that he\r\npaid rather more attention to Ruth than usual when she came down stairs\r\nfreshened up in a light-colored lawn dress and her dark hair handsomely\r\ncoiled and ornamented with a half-blown rose. She sat just opposite\r\nDoctor Ebling and beside Miss Custer, and stood the contrast with that\r\namber-eyed beauty very well. Doctor Ebling thought so, and it had a\r\ntendency to elevate his spirits. The three carried on an animated\r\ndialogue. Mr. Bruce, at the end of the table, was abstracted, and ate\r\nhis supper with great diligence, except when Mrs. Tascher, being his\r\nnearest neighbor, addressed a remark to him: then he turned to her with\r\nthe utmost deference and replied as elaborately as friendly politeness\r\ndemanded.\r\n\r\n\"Any of you folks in for a boat-ride this evening?\" called up Hugh from\r\nthe lower end of the table. \"My Sally Lunn is anchored down by the big\r\noak if you want her, and here's the key,\" holding it up.\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes,\" said Doctor Ebling, taking it upon himself to answer. Hugh's\r\nquestions and remarks were usually addressed to the company\r\ncollectively, and the doctor generally was tacitly elected\r\nspokesman.--\"Don't you want to go, ladies?\" he asked, \"and you, Bruce?\"\r\n\r\nThe ladies, Ruth and Miss Custer, assented with bright looks.\r\n\r\nMr. Bruce replied deliberatively that he was not sure he could leave the\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, come now, Bruce, that's put on,\" said the doctor. \"No man, whatever\r\nhis profession, unless he be a farmer, can convince me of a pressure of\r\nbusiness at this season. Banish the delusive idea and make yourself\r\nagreeable for once.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bruce raised his head, showing at the same time a flash of his white\r\nteeth and his black eyes. \"For once?\" he repeated. \"Making myself\r\nagreeable, or making a grotesque caricature of myself in my struggles to\r\nbe agreeable, has been the business of my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Mr. Bruce!\" laughed Ruth. \"Everybody knows you are delightful, but\r\nthe idea of your making an effort in that direction is too absurd.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I had made that speech,\" thought Miss Custer, \"Mrs. Tascher would\r\nhave looked a severe criticism.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Tascher, as it was, looked across at Ruth and said laughingly,\r\n\"That hits him hard, my dear, but he ought not to wince.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bruce _had_ colored slightly and broken up the gravity of his face.\r\n\r\nLater, when they all rose from the table, Mrs. Tascher, under some\r\npretext or other, detained him a moment. \"Do go!\" she said: \"you see how\r\nit is--Ruth never has the doctor to herself a moment any more. They used\r\nto take delightful little moonlight strolls together, and were as happy\r\nas a pair of young lovers ought to be. Now there is always a third\r\nparty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! So you think I ought to sacrifice myself to the happiness of the\r\nprecious lovers? And what if I get enthralled myself? Who will come to\r\nmy rescue?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am willing to trust you,\" laughed Mrs. Tascher. \"You have thirty\r\nyears upon your head, and a vast amount of hard practicality in it: Dr.\r\nEbling lacks something of both.\"\r\n\r\nThe girls had got their hats and were already out upon the veranda.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Bruce: have you decided whether there is an important case\r\npending or not?\" called the doctor.\r\n\r\nMrs. Tascher gave him a little push, and he sauntered out. She stood in\r\nthe doorway and saw him, with a feeling of satisfaction, pair off with\r\nMiss Custer after they had got outside the gate. \"I believe she likes\r\nhim twenty times better than she does the doctor,\" she soliloquized.\r\n\"And yet with what persistency she clings to Ruth and her lover! Poor\r\nRuth! She takes her down in good faith.\"\r\n\r\nThe stream upon which Westbrook was built was about half a mile distant,\r\nand the sun was going down when they reached the big oak where the boat\r\nwas anchored. Doctor Ebling clambered down the steep bank and unlocked\r\nit, and got in and rowed up a little way to where there was a better\r\ndescent.\r\n\r\n\"Now, then, shall we all go at once,\" said he, \"or take turns?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is such a diminutive vessel,\" said Bruce, eying it doubtingly, \"that\r\nperhaps Miss Custer and myself had better 'pause upon the brink' here,\r\nand wait until you two have made a short voyage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we shall not make a very short voyage,\" said Ruth, running down the\r\nbank and grasping the doctor's hand as he held it out to steady her in\r\nstepping into the boat. \"I want to go up as far as the bridge and make a\r\nsketch to-night: the sunset and the moon-rise are lovely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Better come on--don't think we'll upset,\" said the doctor, beginning,\r\nnevertheless, to push off.\r\n\r\nBruce looked about and found a log to sit on. \"Just spread your shawl on\r\nit,\" said he; and Miss Custer was obliged to unfold her beautiful white\r\nburnous.\r\n\r\n\"What an idea!\" she thought, \"and how ungallant he is!\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet he had a remarkable power of fascination, though, as Ruth said,\r\nhe made no effort to please.\r\n\r\nHe took a seat beside her, and for some time his eyes followed the boat.\r\nAfter a while he said, \"And did you manage to get through with _The\r\nSpanish Gypsy_ again?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no,\" said Miss Custer. \"Didn't you know? The doctor was called into\r\nthe country.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! he was?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you lost your afternoon's entertainment? That must have been a\r\ngreat deprivation.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned his head and looked at her with a lingering, exploring gaze\r\nthat was difficult for her to fathom. How should she answer? He was\r\ncertainly the only being of his sex who baffled or embarrassed her.\r\n\r\n\"It was indeed,\" she returned demurely, and yet with a hope that he\r\nmight discover that she was but half in earnest. Her eyelids drooped and\r\nher lips were curved with a smile. She was pleasurably conscious of his\r\nprolonged gaze, and hoped something from it, knowing from much previous\r\nexperience the power of her beauty.\r\n\r\nThe silence was very eloquent. He broke it--or intensified it indeed--by\r\nrepeating from _The Gypsy_, in a low and remarkably well-modulated\r\nvoice,\r\n\r\n                              \"Do you know\r\n    Sometimes when we sit silent, and the air\r\n    Breathes gently on us from the orange trees,\r\n    It seems that with the whisper of a word\r\n    Our souls must shrink, yet poorer, more apart.\r\n    Is it not so?\r\n\r\nDo you know the answer?\" he asked, never once taking away his eyes.\r\n\r\nShe raised hers and gave it with equal effect:\r\n\r\n              \"Yes, dearest, it is true.\r\n    Speech is but broken light upon the depth\r\n    Of the unspoken: even your loved words\r\n    Float in the larger meaning of your voice\r\n    As something dimmer.\"\r\n\r\nThere was nothing audacious in her manner of repeating it--no coquettish\r\nreference, in voice or glance, to him. She threw into her eyes an\r\nexpression of complete absorption in the spirit and story of the poem,\r\nand appeared to be far away with Don Silva and Fedalina.\r\n\r\nHer seriousness and evident intensity of feeling were a surprise to him.\r\nHe had simply been trying her with a careless stroke, but he seemed to\r\nstrike true flint. \"I could have sworn,\" he thought to himself, \"that\r\nshe was making fun of Ebling's proposition to read to her to-day when\r\nshe said one could stand hearing a poem a good many times.\" And he\r\nactually went on repeating passage after passage, while she sat with her\r\nhands folded and her eyes fixed dreamily, drinking it in like distant\r\nmusic sounding all the way from the Spanish shores.\r\n\r\nThey were both so absorbed--not in the poem, but in thoughts that\r\nfloated under the poem and circled right around themselves--that they\r\ndid not hear the dipping of the oars as the doctor rowed back to shore\r\nin the white moonlight--not softened now, as it had been a while ago, by\r\nthe mellow tints in the west. \"Hallo!\" he called. \"Come down now and\r\nembark.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall we?\" asked Bruce in a voice so low that it seemed almost tender.\r\n\r\nShe answered by getting up, and he took the burnous off the log and\r\nfolded it about her shoulders. It gave her a conscious thrill.\r\n\r\nThey sauntered down, and Bruce gave her his hand to make the descent of\r\nthe bank. Ruth sprang up like a gazelle while the doctor held the boat\r\nto shore, and then pushed it off when the occupants were seated.\r\n\r\n\"I'm the poorest rower in Christendom,\" said Bruce, taking up the oars\r\nand making a few awkward strokes.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind about rowing,\" said Miss Custer. \"When we get out into the\r\ncurrent let us drift: I like it just as well.\"\r\n\r\nBruce did so, resting the handles of the oars upon his knees.\r\n\r\nPerfect silence reigned. The moon was strangely bright, making the very\r\nair silvery. Miss Custer, with the rarest tact, let the stillness alone,\r\nknowing there was power in it.\r\n\r\nBy and by Bruce murmured,\r\n\r\n      \"With dreamful eyes,\r\n      My spirit lies\r\n    Under the walls of Paradise.\r\n\r\nWhat a strange effect moonlight and water have upon us, Miss Custer!\r\nThey seem almost to disembody us. I can hardly ever recall a single line\r\nof poetry in the daytime when the sun is shining. But moonlight brings\r\nout all the delicate images of the mind's palimpsest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray, then, go on and repeat something more,\" said Miss Custer in a\r\nlow voice: \"I like to hear you. Repeat the rest of 'Drifting.'\"\r\n\r\nBruce complied, and then struck upon Byron, and was surprised and\r\ndelighted to find that Miss Custer followed him even there. The truth\r\nwas, Miss Custer had rehearsed all these things many times before with\r\ndifferent actors. The whole plot lay before her, ending and all. Bruce\r\nwas certainly hooked, and all she had to do was to draw the line\r\ncarefully in. To be sure, he was an odd specimen, a sort of man she was\r\nnot much acquainted with; but that made him all the more interesting,\r\nand she was conscious of her power to manage him.\r\n\r\nAt last Bruce put the boat about without consulting her, and rowed back\r\nto the landing in silence and with considerable dexterity, considering\r\nhis self-depreciation as a rower. Ruth and the doctor, who had no doubt\r\nbeen affected by the moonlight too, stood on the bank waiting for them.\r\nThey all went home together, a rather merry party, and immediately\r\ndispersed for the night.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, when Miss Custer came down to breakfast radiant and\r\njoyous, with a consciousness of being in perfect keeping with the\r\nunpoetic sunshine, she was stricken with consternation at finding Mr.\r\nBruce as distant and nonchalant as ever. No lingering, exploring glance\r\nthis morning--nothing but the usual flash of his dark eyes as he bowed\r\nto her. Was it possible that all the fine effects of last night had\r\npassed out of his consciousness?\r\n\r\nSome time during the day Bruce found an opportunity to say to Mrs.\r\nTascher, \"Don't ask me to do it again: I came near making a fool of\r\nmyself last night. Got to quoting poetry and all that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you, indeed?\" said she, laughing. \"If the siren had that effect on\r\nyou, a hardened bachelor, consider how it would go with Ebling.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ebling's heart is supposed to be preoccupied,\" said Bruce: \"mine is an\r\n'aching void.'\"\r\n\r\nThat evening Hugh challenged Miss Custer to a game of croquet, and she,\r\nwith secret reluctance, but a very good grace--being one of those\r\nsweetly-amiable people who never speak ill of any one, and never\r\nmanifest the least boredom, no matter who undertakes the office of\r\nentertainer to them--accepted. However, she would make the most she\r\ncould out of it. She invited the rest of the company to come down and\r\nlook on and see that she had fair play. Bruce, at whom she glanced\r\nappealingly, paid no heed, but put on his hat and went down town with\r\nthe air of a man greatly preoccupied and oppressed with business cares.\r\nMrs. Tascher never went out when the dew was falling, and so there was\r\nnobody but Ruth and the doctor. They complied at once, and took seats on\r\na rustic bench under the trees.\r\n\r\nMiss Custer was conscious of showing to advantage in this picturesque\r\ngame, and paid far more attention to her attitudes than her strokes: as\r\na consequence, she was beaten, and immediately threw down her mallet.\r\n\r\n\"I'll give you another chance,\" said Hugh wistfully.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I could never redeem myself with you if we should play till\r\ndoomsday,\" she answered.\r\n\r\n\"You _have_ beaten me,\" persisted Hugh.\r\n\r\n\"But I have a presentiment that I can't do it to-night,\" she returned.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, Hugh,\" said the doctor, getting up and helping himself to a\r\nmallet, \"if she is so disheartened, suppose we give her a chance to come\r\noff second best by taking a game with me?\"\r\n\r\nHugh, smiling, but a little put out, stepped back, and the contest\r\nbegan, with far more animation on the part of Miss Custer. Presently\r\nHugh's mother called him, and he went away. After a time Ruth called to\r\nthe players, who were both at the other end of the ground, \"Say, folks,\r\nif you'll excuse _me_ I'll go in.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Custer turned round and answered, \"Oh, poor child! I presume you do\r\nfind it dull.\"\r\n\r\nRuth ran up to Mrs. Tascher's room. Her acquaintance with that lady she\r\ncounted among the best things of her life. The world had seemed larger\r\nand brighter and better since she had known her.\r\n\r\nMrs. Tascher was a widow: she had considerable wealth, but being an\r\ninvalid she was deprived of the enjoyment of it to a great extent. She\r\nwelcomed Ruth's friendly little visits always with a smile that seemed\r\nto make her soul stand out upon her face. She was what one might call a\r\nwoman of the world. That is, she had travelled much, read much, studied\r\npeople much, and mingled all her previous life in intelligent and\r\nrefined society.\r\n\r\n\"Why, where is the rest of your party, my dear?\" she asked as Ruth\r\ntapped on the door and came in.\r\n\r\n\"Hugh's mother wanted him,\" Ruth answered, \"and I left Frank and Miss\r\nCuster playing a game.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Tascher's smile faded. She felt tempted to speak a word of warning,\r\nbut it seemed too bad to destroy the innocent faith of this high-minded,\r\nunsuspecting girl. She gave Ruth a chair, and Ruth begged her to read\r\nsomething: Mrs. Tascher's reading was sweeter than music to her. She\r\ncomplied readily, because it gave her pleasure to do anything Ruth\r\nasked. \"Here is a poem by Whittier, just out,\" she said, taking up a\r\nmagazine, the leaves of which she had cut only that afternoon. She began\r\nit, and Ruth leaned back in her chair and closed her eyes the better to\r\nsee the images that passed in her mind. Mrs. Tascher read on until the\r\nlight grew so dim that she could not see the lines, and then she got up\r\nand went to the window to finish. She glanced out as she did so, and\r\nstood silent. At last she said, \"Come here, Ruth.\"\r\n\r\nRuth got up and went and looked out.\r\n\r\nAway down at the farther end of the lawn stood Miss Custer and the\r\ndoctor with their elbows resting upon the fence, evidently very deeply\r\nabsorbed in each other. The spot was very lonely and still, hemmed in by\r\ntrees, and would not have been visible from below--perhaps from hardly\r\nany other point but this window.\r\n\r\n\"Doesn't it strike you, Ruth, that a couple of young people must be\r\nrather sentimental to stray away like that?\" asked Mrs. Tascher.\r\n\r\nRuth laughed, but not very joyously, and immediately turned away from\r\nthe window, as though the sight hurt her.\r\n\r\nMrs. Tascher did so too, and struck a match to light her lamp. \"If I\r\nwere you, Ruth,\" she said as she settled the shade over it, \"I would go\r\ndown to the croquet-ground, from where you can see those people, and\r\ncall to them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no,\" said Ruth with a shiver.\r\n\r\n\"Why, you see,\" continued Mrs. Tascher, \"it doesn't look well. Miss\r\nCuster ought to know better, but she is so vain of her influence over\r\ngentlemen that she exercises it upon every occasion that offers. It\r\ndoesn't appear to make any difference who the gentleman is: it would be\r\nall the same to her now if it were Hugh instead of the doctor. I believe\r\nshe does care something for Bruce, and he is her lawful prey; but she\r\nknows the doctor is not in the market.\"\r\n\r\nRuth threw back her head proudly. \"He _can_ be in the market,\" she said\r\nhoarsely.\r\n\r\n\"No, no, my dear,\" said Mrs. Tascher, shaking her head. \"I don't want\r\nyou to get reckless: I want to see you play this game with Miss Custer\r\nwith a cool hand and come out ahead. You can do it, and you will be\r\nstronger and safer in the end.\"\r\n\r\nRuth pretty soon went out. She entered her room with her hand upon her\r\nheart, and sat down by the window without striking a light. In the\r\ncourse of half an hour the doctor and Miss Custer appeared in sight,\r\nwalking slowly toward the house. They passed directly under her window,\r\nbut their voices were so low that she could distinguish no word. By and\r\nby she heard the piano going. A moment after Mrs. Tascher tapped on her\r\ndoor, and, turning the knob, put her head in and called, \"Ruth!\"\r\n\r\nRuth got up and came forward.\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" said her visitor, \"let us go down to the parlor.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot,\" said Ruth: \"please don't ask me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Foolish child!\" said Mrs. Tascher. \"I am a thousand times sorry that I\r\nbrought this thing to your notice.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was brought to my notice long ago,\" said Ruth brokenly; and Mrs.\r\nTascher turned and went down stairs.\r\n\r\nThe doctor was leaning back in an easy-chair, completely absorbed in\r\nwatching the exquisite figure at the piano and listening to the strains\r\nshe evoked.\r\n\r\n\"One _would_ think she had feeling,\" commented Mrs. Tascher mentally as\r\nshe entered the room and swept across to the vacant seat beside the\r\ndoctor, dispelling somehow, with her strong presence, the spirit of\r\nsentimentalism that pervaded the atmosphere. \"Why, Doctor Ebling, are\r\nyou here?\" she asked: \"I supposed you had gone to town. Where is Miss\r\nStanley?\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I don't know,\" said the doctor--honestly enough, to be sure.\r\n\r\n\"I thought you all went down to the croquet-ground?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we did. But she came back, and left Miss Custer and myself to\r\nfinish our game.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, then I presume she is in her room.--Have you finished playing, Miss\r\nCuster?\" with a smile of placid indifference as Miss Custer turned round\r\non the piano-stool.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Miss Custer, getting up and taking a chair. \"Doctor Ebling\r\nwished to hear the 'Last Hope.'\"\r\n\r\n\"You haven't come to that in your experience yet, have you, doctor?\"\r\nlaughed Mrs. Tascher, though she was not in the habit of playing upon\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said the doctor. \"It seems to me the 'last hope' is that we feel\r\nwhen we draw our last breath.\"\r\n\r\nThe three spent the evening together, and Mrs. Tascher brought into\r\nexercise the old charms and graces of manner and conversation that years\r\nago had made her one of the most brilliant and fascinating women society\r\ncould boast of. She was not old--not more than thirty-five--and when\r\nanimated she was still beautiful: her face became illuminated and stars\r\nshone in her eyes. She so far outdid Miss Custer in the matter of\r\npleasing and entertaining that when the doctor went away he hardly\r\nthought of the latter. He said to himself as he went down town, \"What a\r\nremarkably brilliant woman Mrs. Tascher must have been in her day! And\r\nis yet, for that matter. Husband been dead six years: wonder why she\r\nnever married again?\"\r\n\r\nThen he wondered with a slight feeling of uneasiness where Ruth had kept\r\nherself all the evening. \"How affectionately and admiringly Mrs. Tascher\r\nalways speaks of Ruth!\" he said, and added, \"Well, she is a noble girl.\"\r\n\r\nThere was an indefinable hardness in Ruth's manner the next morning. Her\r\nvoice was hollow and her smile seemed ironical, though she was unusually\r\ngay. Mrs. Tascher, who observed her closely and with some uneasiness,\r\nthought her mockingly attentive to Miss Custer. Something was said at\r\nthe dinner-table again about the doctor's promise to read to Miss\r\nCuster, and Ruth exclaimed, \"By all means!--Miss Custer, make him stay\r\nat home and read you that poem.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor of course fell readily in with the idea, and said he would\r\nnot go down town this time to see if there were any orders: if anybody\r\nwanted him it was generally known that if he was not in his office he\r\nwas at his boarding-place.\r\n\r\n\"Why _did_ you do it?\" said Mrs. Tascher, putting her handkerchief on\r\nher head and going down to the gate with Ruth.\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" said Ruth with drawn lips and heaving bosom, \"I do not want\r\nto get him unfairly. If there is some one else who interests him more\r\nthan I, he is still at liberty to choose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ruth,\" said Mrs. Tascher, and her eyes flashed, \"do you think she is\r\ngetting him fairly? You have no conception of the scheming of that\r\nwoman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, indeed I believe I know it all,\" said Ruth, and hurried away.\r\n\r\nIn a few days school closed, and Ruth packed her trunk and went up to\r\nMerton, a little village about twenty miles distant, to visit her aunt.\r\nAlmost as soon as she was gone Miss Custer was taken sick. Aunt Ruby\r\ninsisted upon her occupying the spare bedroom, a cool, spacious\r\napartment opening off the back sitting-room. The professional services\r\nof Doctor Ebling were of course engaged at once, and he proved himself\r\nvery attentive at least.\r\n\r\nTo save appearances and for Ruth's sake, although she had little hope,\r\nMrs. Tascher took up her position in the sick-room and compelled the\r\ndoctor to give all his directions to her. He pronounced the malady a low\r\nfever brought on by the extreme heat of the season. Mrs. Tascher thought\r\nit was the result of exposure to night-dews, carelessness in regard to\r\ndiet and lack of proper exercise.\r\n\r\nHer presence, it must be allowed, put but little constraint upon the\r\nextraordinary intimacy of the pair. The doctor was all devotion, and\r\nMiss Custer all languor and dependence. She made a beautiful invalid,\r\nwith her rare complexion and her white, lissome hands lying so restfully\r\nand helplessly on the counterpane. One day, after being freshly dressed\r\nin an embroidered gown of the finest texture, and instructing Mrs.\r\nTascher how to wind her hair, which was long and abundant, around the\r\ntop of her head in a coronet that was very becoming to her, she\r\nrequested to have Mr. Bruce sent in when he came to his dinner. She had\r\nsome affairs that must be looked into immediately by a legal eye.\r\n\r\n\"Had you not better just send him a message?\" asked Mrs. Tascher.\r\n\r\n\"No: I prefer to attend to it myself,\" she returned coldly.\r\n\r\nBruce was therefore sent in, and Mrs. Tascher stepped out into the\r\nsitting-room. Miss Custer, who was certainly very white, raised her\r\ndusky eyelids, smiled faintly and held out her jewelled hand. Bruce,\r\nstanding awkwardly enough by the bed-side, took it, but without apparent\r\nappreciation of its loveliness.\r\n\r\nThe invalid had chosen an inopportune moment: despite the subdued light\r\nof the chamber, it was high noon and the sun shone burningly outside,\r\nand Bruce, who had just eaten a hearty dinner, was utterly devoid of\r\nsentiment and indifferent to nice effects. There was a tumbler of dewy\r\nroses on a little table beside the bed, and he picked out one, and,\r\nsitting down, began eating the leaves one by one. \"I hope,\" said he,\r\nthinking it a good plan to rally the sick a little, \"you haven't got so\r\ndiscouraged by this indisposition--which the doctor tells me is not at\r\nall serious--that you wish to make your will?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she returned, hardly able to conceal her disgust at the unfeeling\r\nwretch: \"I merely wish to send to my attorney for some money.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, is that it?\" said Bruce, laughing. \"Then the doctor was right. So\r\nlong as a person takes a controlling interest in his affairs he is\r\nsafe.\"\r\n\r\n\"A _person_!\" thought Miss Custer, and really curled her lip. She gave\r\nhim her lawyer's address, stated the sum she wanted and told him he\r\nmight say that she was ill.\r\n\r\n\"And unable to write,\" added Bruce. \"All right! I shall be as prompt in\r\nthe execution of your commission as the exigences of the case appear to\r\ndemand.\"\r\n\r\nHe took up his hat and went out cheerily, and Miss Custer turned her\r\nface to the wall and cried. For a day or two she was worse: then she\r\ngrew better, and was finally able to sit up. At the expiration of two\r\nweeks Ruth came back. She was very pale and her face had a rigid look.\r\nMiss Custer met her sweetly, being still under the subduing influence of\r\ninvalidism, and Ruth tried to feel kindly to her; which was a great\r\nvexation to Mrs. Tascher.\r\n\r\n\"Let me alone,\" said Ruth passionately one day. \"Don't you see how I\r\nhate her? I could almost kill her! I am trying to fight down the demon\r\nin me.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor, who had himself grown thin and haggard-looking, welcomed\r\nRuth back with an air of constraint.\r\n\r\nOne day the young folks of the village got up a picnic and invited Aunt\r\nRuby's boarders. The doctor at first hesitated about giving his\r\npermission for Miss Custer to go, but she coaxed, and he finally\r\nconsented. The evening before the picnic Ruth requested an interview\r\nwith the doctor, and they walked out into the grove. She told him she\r\nwished to release him from his engagement, and it was a painful\r\nsatisfaction to her to see the agony that was in his face. He accused\r\nhimself bitterly--said he had broken up her happiness and ruined her\r\nlife, that he could never forgive himself, and ended by refusing to\r\naccept his release, and declaring that he should never avail himself of\r\nany of the advantages it offered.\r\n\r\nThe next morning he went to Bruce with white face and strained eyes,\r\nand begged him, for the love he bore him, to take Miss Custer to the\r\npicnic and to stay by her.\r\n\r\n\"So, my boy,\" said Bruce, not a little affected, \"you have got into the\r\nditch and want me to help you out? Well, I will do what I can.--Thank\r\nthe Lord, his eyes are opened at last!\" he muttered as Ebling went away.\r\n\r\nThe picnic-ground was a wooded hillside that sloped down into a grassy\r\nmeadow a mile from town. The company all got together at the appointed\r\nhour--two in the afternoon--in the street below Aunt Ruby's, and waited\r\nfor her boarders to come out. Ruth had persuaded Mrs. Tascher to go, and\r\nthe doctor, with a painful attempt to appear natural, kept beside her\r\nand was scrupulously attentive to her comfort. Ruth playfully claimed\r\nHugh as her escort. Bruce, true to agreement, monopolized Miss Custer in\r\na masterly way, much to her surprise. She tried to snub him at first,\r\nbut he ignored all her efforts in that direction with consummate\r\nstupidity, and in the end she submitted with a charming grace that was\r\ntorture to the doctor.\r\n\r\nEverybody seemed in fine spirits, but on the part of two or three\r\nmembers of the company we have reason to suppose that it was _only_\r\nseeming. And perhaps a little general knowledge of the affairs of\r\nmankind might justify us in the suspicion that there were others not so\r\nhappy as their bright looks seemed to warrant. But, however that might\r\nbe, every one threw in his or her contribution to the pleasure and\r\namusement of the day. The doctor helped to lay out a croquet-ground and\r\nfixed the target for archery-practice; Hugh was active in putting up\r\nswings; some of the older and more dignified gentlemen, including Bruce,\r\ntook upon themselves the lighter duty of entertaining the ladies; when\r\nlunch-time came some of the young fellows kindled a fire, and Ruth\r\nboiled the coffee. After that there was a good deal of pairing off and\r\nwalking about, or sitting cozily upon old mossy, fallen trunks of trees.\r\n\r\nMiss Custer, who had not yet risen from the grass-plot where she had\r\nsat to eat her dinner, looked away down across the green meadows with\r\nsleepy, half-shut eyes, and asked, \"What is that pile of stones in the\r\ncorner yonder?\"\r\n\r\nA youthful jeweller whom she remembered among her distant admirers\r\nanswered, \"It's an old well. This place here used to be a stock-farm,\r\nbut it hasn't been used for that for a good many years; so the framework\r\nand buckets have been taken away.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Custer, seized with a sudden impulse, sprang up and exclaimed, \"I\r\nhave a great mind to go down and take a look into it. Old wells have a\r\npeculiar fascination for me, and that one looks so lovely and romantic!\"\r\n\r\nShe had a thought that Bruce might volunteer to accompany her, but that\r\nindolent barrister, sprawling upon the grass at her feet, hardly felt\r\ncalled upon by the nature of his agreement with Ebling to undergo quite\r\nso much as that. He reflected that it was his business to keep the\r\ncharmer out of mischief for the day. \"And if she meanders away to that\r\nfascinating well,\" he thought, \"in her own solitary company, nobody will\r\nbe damaged, so far as I can see.\"\r\n\r\nBut Miss Custer, seeing no other way and feeling the position a little\r\nawkward, appealed to Ruth, who got up and started with her. When they\r\nhad clambered down the rather steep hill to the meadow's edge Miss\r\nCuster affectionately took her arm. \"Don't you think picnics are stupid\r\nthings?\" she asked confidingly.\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" said Ruth, \"we didn't think so this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no, not when we were anticipating, but\r\n\r\n    One of the pleasures of having a rout\r\n    Is the pleasure of having it over.\r\n\r\nI shall be glad when we get back home, though I suppose we shall not\r\nstart till near sundown.\"\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the well Miss Custer stepped upon the flat white\r\nstones with which it was walled up to the surface of the ground and\r\ngazed down into its dark depths. \"What a queer feeling that is which one\r\nis almost sure to have standing upon the edge of danger!--a sort of\r\nreckless impulse to throw one's self forward. Did you ever feel it?\"\r\nRuth, standing just behind her as she leaned over, saw her hands\r\ninvoluntarily clutch her dress, as though the strange temptation were so\r\ngreat that she must hold herself forcibly back from it. \"I have--a\r\nthousand times,\" she added; \"and I feel it now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take care!\" cried Ruth, catching at her.\r\n\r\nMiss Custer, in turning away her charmed gaze, lost her balance from\r\nsheer dizziness and plunged forward. Ruth, with a look and cry of\r\nhorror, bent over and saw the fearful descent, so quick and so noiseless\r\nuntil the dull splash was heard and the black water opened and closed\r\nagain. Then she threw up her hands and started to run toward the hill,\r\ncalling loudly. But already they had seen and were coming. One--Doctor\r\nEbling--was far ahead of the rest. Ruth met him and turned back with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Ruth, you did it: I saw you push her,\" he found breath to say. But\r\nRuth's sensibilities were too shocked to feel the accusation.\r\n\r\nThe doctor was halfway down the well before any one else reached the\r\nspot. Bruce had had the forethought to cut down a swing and bring the\r\nrope. In a very few minutes Miss Custer--or what was believed to be her\r\nlifeless body--was lying wet upon the grass and the doctor, also\r\ndripping, was making a hasty examination of her condition. \"I think she\r\nwill live,\" was his verdict, \"but we must get her home with all speed.\"\r\n\r\nA light wagon coming up the road was signalled to, and they got her into\r\nit and drove furiously to town. By the time the rest of the party\r\nreached home she was partially recovered, though very weak and terribly\r\nshaken.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was said that she was out of danger and would probably\r\nsuffer no serious consequences Ruth recalled the doctor's frightful\r\nwords: \"You did it: I saw you push her.\"\r\n\r\nShe rushed in search of him. He was in the parlor, walking back and\r\nforth with a troubled air. She went up to him: \"Frank, you accused me\r\nof doing that dreadful thing. I have just remembered what you said--that\r\nyou saw me push her. I did not: I put out my hand to save her.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope to God you did!\" said he, but his look was doubting and\r\nreproachful.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Frank,\" she said, with scarcely enough breath to speak the words,\r\n\"if you do not believe me it will kill me!\"\r\n\r\nJust then some one came to the door and beckoned to him, and he went\r\nout. Ruth turned, with a breaking heart, to go up stairs. The youthful\r\njeweller was talking to Mrs. Tascher in the hall. \"Yes,\" he was saying,\r\n\"I saw it all. She was standing leaning over the well, and was just\r\nturning to step back when she gave a sort of lurch as if she had got\r\ndizzy, and Miss Stanley reached out her hand and caught her by the\r\nshoulder. But she had got the start of her, and over she went in a\r\ntwinkling. The whole thing was done in an instant.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Mr. Omes, I wish you would explain all that to Doctor Ebling,\" said\r\nRuth, coming up.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he knows all about it: he saw it the same as I did,\" said the young\r\nman.\r\n\r\nA suspicion crossed Ruth's mind that the doctor _knew_, but she could\r\nnot believe him so base.\r\n\r\nMiss Custer was doomed to have a serious time of it, after all. The\r\ngreat excitement brought on fever again, and for some days her recovery\r\nwas thought doubtful. Everybody in the house did all that was in her or\r\nhis power to do, and the doctor was more devoted than ever. It became a\r\nfixed idea that he would marry Miss Custer as soon as she was able to\r\nsit up. He and Ruth scarcely spoke to each other.\r\n\r\nOne day Mrs. Tascher told Ruth she must go away.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know,\" answered Ruth: \"I am going.\"\r\n\r\nShe packed her trunk again--this time taking all her things--and went\r\nback to her aunt's. In less than a week Mrs. Tascher had a letter from\r\nher stating that she had started, under the escort of a friend of her\r\nguardian's, for Beirut.\r\n\r\nIt was so great a shock to Mrs. Tascher that she scarcely left her room\r\nfor ten days after it, and indeed did not wholly recover until another\r\nletter came, dated from far-off Syria, with a curious commingling of the\r\nstrange and the familiar in the well-known handwriting and the foreign\r\npost-mark, assuring her that her young friend was safely sheltered under\r\nthe protection of her guardian and his estimable wife. Ruth dwelt\r\nentirely upon her new experience, and never mentioned the old. She had\r\nnot so much to say about her journey, though it was interesting and\r\ndelightful, as about her arrival and the meeting with her dear friends,\r\nwhose loved faces were so sweetly familiar in that strange, strange land\r\nthat she fell upon their necks and wept. She drew vivid pictures of the\r\nmagnificent scenery that lay around her in her new home--the gardens,\r\nthe orange-groves, the figs and olives, the terraced slope of Mount\r\nLebanon, the glorious Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nMrs. Tascher was comforted, though the void made by Ruth's absence was\r\nalmost like death, the wide space seemed so unspannable. She wrote back\r\nat once in all the fulness of her heart, and Ruth was not so absorbed in\r\ngrief for the loss of her lover but that she appreciated and was deeply\r\ngrateful for the tender, unfailing affection of her friend. Mrs.\r\nTascher, who felt that the sharpest knife was the best to be used in a\r\ncase of urgent surgical necessity, wrote briefly that the doctor and\r\nMiss Custer were married--that Miss Custer had begged for at least three\r\nmonths' preparation, but the doctor was impatient; and so, as soon as\r\nshe was able to stand the journey to Boston, where her friends and\r\nproperty were, they had joined hands and started.\r\n\r\n\"The marriage took place in the parlor,\" Mrs. Tascher wrote, \"and the\r\nhousehold were invited to be present. I, however, had a bad headache and\r\ncould not get down stairs; Bruce pleaded 'business;' and poor Hugh,\r\nwhose boyish affections have been cruelly tampered with, had a fishing\r\nengagement. So there was nobody but Aunt Ruby and her 'help' to witness\r\nthe touching ceremony except the minister and his wife. It _was_\r\ntouching, I suppose: Miss Custer wept bitterly at being so 'neglected,'\r\nand Ebling is mortally offended with Bruce.\"\r\n\r\nThree years went by; which space of time Mrs. Tascher spent chiefly in\r\nFlorida and New York, going back and forth as the seasons changed in\r\nobedience to medical authority. At last she concluded to try a few weeks\r\nin Westbrook again. Aunt Ruby, who still kept boarders--all strangers,\r\nhowever--gave her the old rooms up stairs with their pleasant windows.\r\nHere she sat and wrote to Ruth a few days after her arrival.\r\n\r\nRuth had become quite contented, and even happy, under the warm Syrian\r\nsun, watching with earnest, loving eyes the development of barbarism and\r\nheathenism into civilization and Christianity, though it seemed very\r\nmuch to her sometimes as if she had lost her place and personality in\r\nthe world. She was swallowed up in the great pagan East, and was nothing\r\nto the land that owned her--to the people that were her people. She was\r\ndead to the life and world to which she had been born.\r\n\r\nThe family of her guardian, together with some of their pupils, had\r\nremoved to a little village up the side of the mount to spend a few of\r\nthe hottest weeks, as was their custom. The mail was regularly brought\r\nup by a young Arab riding a mule. One evening, when Ruth had gone to sit\r\nalone on one of the grassy terraces overlooking the sea and the\r\nluxuriant foliage and vegetation below--a thing she liked, though it\r\nusually made her pensive and a little sad--a young Syrian girl ran down\r\nand gave her a letter. It was Mrs. Tascher's, and I will take the\r\nliberty to transcribe a part of it here:\r\n\r\n\"Aunt Ruby has furnished me with a good many surprising items in regard\r\nto the fortunes and actions of our old associates. Bruce (he was a\r\nsplendid fellow--wasn't he?--solid, practical and all that), who, you\r\nremember, had a good deal of means, has built himself a house, something\r\nquite elegant. It stands on that little knoll on the other side of the\r\ntown, overlooking the river. I mean to go over and take a look at it\r\nsome day: it is said to be beautifully furnished, and is kept by an old\r\nmaiden aunt of our friend. Bruce, by the way, is in Europe, though what\r\ntook him there I cannot conjecture, unless he means to bring home a\r\nEuropean exportation in the shape of a wife. I wish, my dear, _you_ had\r\ntaken a fancy to him: I always thought he admired you. You don't mind my\r\nprobing an old wound--do you?--because I want to speak of some of the\r\nothers. Miss Custer's fortune, as it turned out, was extremely limited.\r\nShe had, I believe, enough to furnish a small rented house here, and she\r\nand the doctor immediately went to housekeeping. But time, which settles\r\nall things and places them in their true light and relations, has\r\nbrought to the notice of this precious pair that they are very ill\r\nadapted to each other: it is even said that they quarrel. The coarser\r\ngossips affirm that Mrs. Ebling is lazy and shiftless, and that the\r\ndoctor is disheartened and neglects his business. I have seen him once,\r\nand can judge something of his state by his bearing and looks. He is\r\ncertainly not the sort of man I once thought he would make. Whether\r\nthere is better stuff in him than what we see developed, or whether he\r\nowes what he is entirely to circumstances, is an unsolvable question. I\r\nam inclined to think that every person has the making of two individuals\r\nin him--one bad, the other good. What a pity that a man usually has only\r\none chance! If he makes a mistake he is lost. My dear Ruth, in the whole\r\ncourse of my life I have kept my eyes upon the infallible law of cause\r\nand effect; and I know this, that wrong-doing inevitably brings its own\r\nretribution.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Ruth took her eyes from this letter and fixed them upon the distant\r\nblue water-depths they were brimful of tears. \"Yes, wrong-doing is\r\nfollowed by retribution,\" she thought, \"but where is the reward for\r\nright-doing?\"\r\n\r\nOh, she felt so lonely in that far-off heathen land, with the shadow of\r\nothers' wrong-doing lying always across her path! Why must she suffer\r\nand be alone?\r\n\r\nA step from behind startled her, and she sprang up and turned round. A\r\npair of black eyes were smiling at her from a handsome, familiar face.\r\n\"Oh, Mr. Bruce!\" she cried, and flew up the steps, holding out both her\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\"I have come such a long way to see you,\" said Bruce, \"that my motive\r\nmust be pretty conspicuous: I don't mean to try to conceal it. Perhaps\r\nyou have never thought of me as a man you would be at all likely to\r\nmarry. Still, I have made it my business to come and ask you, and I\r\nthought I might better let you know my errand at once, instead of\r\nleaving you to guess it from any clownish efforts of mine to do the\r\nagreeable to you.\"\r\n\r\nHe certainly broke it to her very well, smiling and holding her\r\nhands--so well that she laughed heartily and was at home with him in a\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nOne day it was rumored in Westbrook that Bruce had come home with a\r\nwife. The news had but just reached Aunt Ruby's premises when Bruce\r\nhimself came rapidly up the path and asked for Mrs. Tascher. She came\r\ndown at once. \"I have come for you to go and call upon my wife,\" said\r\nhe.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Mr. Bruce--\" she began.\r\n\r\nBut he stopped her, and in spite of her demurring carried her off.\r\n\r\n\"You certainly _have_ a lovely place, Mr. Bruce,\" she said, looking\r\nadmiringly round as they mounted the front steps of his residence. The\r\ndoor flew open, and there, waiting to welcome her, stood the\r\nbride--Ruth.\r\n\r\n  ALICE ILGENFRITZ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHERE LIGHTNING STRIKES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe air has been growing hotter for many days, with \"occasional\r\ncounteracting influences\" (as \"Probabilities\" says), until the\r\nsunshine-loving doves hide under shadowing gables and the robins and\r\nsparrows sit on the lower branches of the trees with little wings lifted\r\nfrom their palpitating sides. The multitudinous shrilling of the\r\ngrasshoppers adds emphasis to the white heats of the air. Even the\r\nhousefly seeks the shade and hums drowsily in complicated orbits about\r\nthe upper part of the room, or, with too keen proboscis, destroys my\r\nlast crumb of comfort, the post-prandial nap.\r\n\r\nMy eyes open upon a world that dreams. The trees stand motionless. Among\r\ntheir tops the bull-bat darts erratically. The pale star of thistledown\r\nmounts on some mysterious current, like an infant soul departing\r\nheavenward. The hum of the near city is hushed. The sound of the\r\nchurch-bells is muffled. The trumpeting of the steamer comes from the\r\nbay, as though some lone sea-monster called aloud for companionship.\r\nThere is a sudden rattle and roar as a train rushes by, and then the\r\nsmoke drifts away over the glowing landscape.\r\n\r\nBut there is an increasing opaque dimness in the western horizon that\r\nsteadily deepens in color. Fleece-like clouds rapidly increase in height\r\nand density, and a sheet of pale flame flashes from the midst and is\r\ngone. A glowing, crinkly line marks the edge of the cloud, and\r\ndisappears.\r\n\r\nNow swallows soar far up in the sky, the doves make wild, uncertain\r\nflights above the steeples, and the hoarse trumpet of the steamer again\r\ncalls for recognition. At the west another bright line falls, zigzag, to\r\na distant hill, revealed an instant, then lost in the shadow of the\r\ncloud. Soon there is a low, momentary rumble, and you are assured that\r\nthe swift, delightful, dangerous shower, that cools the earth without\r\ninterrupting our pleasures for dreary days, is approaching. No one whose\r\ndwelling is not better protected than most of those which bear the vain\r\nand flimsy decorations called \"lightning-rods\" can know whether his own\r\nhouse may not in a few moments receive a ruinous stroke, or that it may\r\nnot be his lot to enter eternity with the first flash from that dark,\r\ntowering mass of sulphurous hue that already casts its ominous shadow\r\nupon his face.\r\n\r\nTimid persons should experience gladness rather than alarm at the sound\r\nof the thunder and the flash of the lightning, both being signals that\r\npersonal danger is past for the time. Persons who have been struck and\r\nrendered insensible, but who have afterward recovered, had not seen or\r\nheard what hurt them. Unless we are acquainted with the locality, and\r\nknow the points likely to receive the fiery bolt; if a disruptive\r\ndischarge occurs near us there is no telling the spot of danger or of\r\nsafety in open ground. A discharge from the front of the cloud may take\r\na downward angle of forty-five degrees, and, passing over hill and\r\nforest, strike an insignificant knoll or a moist meadow half a mile in\r\nadvance of the cloud. For myself, if overtaken in the country by a\r\nthunderstorm, I would seek the nearest and most convenient shelter from\r\nthe rain and take my chance with the lightning.\r\n\r\nTeams and the persons accompanying them appear to be peculiarly in\r\ndanger during a thunderstorm. Caves, and even deep mines, afford no\r\nabsolute safety, for the thunderbolt has been known to enter even these.\r\nTall trees are more dangerous than low ones, but none of them appear\r\ncapable of affording protection against this mysterious element. The\r\npeople of different countries have regarded various kinds of trees as\r\nexempt from the electric stroke, but inquiry has always shown that every\r\nspecies has suffered in one locality or another. The beech, from some\r\ncause, has probably escaped more generally than any other tree of\r\nconsiderable size in northern latitudes. But it is the neighborhood of a\r\ngood conductor, not a sheltering non-conductor, that affords safety.\r\nSome scientific men have advised a station of fifteen to forty feet from\r\na tree, or such a position between several trees, but it has sometimes\r\nhappened that such open spaces have received the bolt. In cities and\r\nvillages, likewise, open spaces are not found to be places of\r\nsafety.[5]\r\n\r\nThe question whether the small metallic articles usually carried about\r\nthe person increase the danger is a matter of some concern. Many persons\r\non the approach of a thunderstorm customarily relieve themselves of\r\nthese things. Hair-pins, clasps and the metallic springs often used in\r\nthe dresses of ladies are not, however, so easily got rid of. From the\r\nrecord of the effects of lightning upon the human body we reach the\r\nconclusion that metal is dangerous about the person only according to\r\nits position. Constantine mentions that during a thunderstorm a lady\r\nraised her arm to close a window, when a flash of lightning entered: her\r\ngolden bracelet was entirely dissipated, but without the slightest\r\ninjury to the wearer. A similar case is reported in the _Edinburgh New\r\nPhilosophical Journal_ for 1844. During a violent thunderstorm a\r\nfishing-boat belonging to Midyell, in the Shetland Islands, was struck\r\nby lightning. The discharge came down the mast (which it tore into\r\nshivers) and melted a watch in the pocket of a man who was sitting close\r\nby, without at all injuring him. He was not even aware of what had\r\nhappened until, on taking out his watch, he found it fused into one\r\nmass. Instances might be cited where a portion of the shoe was carried\r\naway without serious injury to the wearer, and where knitting-needles,\r\nscissors and other household implements have been struck, sometimes\r\nconducting the current to the person with fatal effect.\r\n\r\nDuring a thunderstorm in France in July, 1858, a peasant-woman, on her\r\nway home from the fields, was struck down by lightning. No wound was\r\ndetected upon her person, but her hair was singed and a part of a silver\r\ncomb melted. Here metal seems to have conducted the electricity to the\r\nbody. On the other hand, the traveller Brydone relates a circumstance\r\nwhich happened to a lady who was regarding a thunderstorm from her\r\nwindow. At a flash of lightning her bonnet was reduced to ashes, nothing\r\nelse about her being affected. Brydone supposes the electric current to\r\nhave been attracted by the metallic wire which maintained the shape of\r\nher bonnet. Hence he proposes that either these wires be abandoned or in\r\ntimes of danger a metallic chain be attached to the bonnet, by which the\r\ncharge might pass to the earth. Accordingly, we find that it became\r\nfashionable in France at that period to wear on the top of the bonnet an\r\nornament of bright metal connecting with a small silver chain dropping\r\ndown to the ground. At about the same time umbrellas were carried fitted\r\nwith wires and chain for a similar purpose.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1819, lightning fell upon the prison of Biberach in Suabia, and\r\nthere struck, in a common apartment, among twenty prisoners, one only--a\r\ncondemned captain of brigands, who was chained about the waist. A\r\nsimilar arrangement of metal proved fatal in another case. On the 9th of\r\nOctober, 1836, on the coast of Italy, a young man was struck by\r\nlightning and killed. It was found that he wore a girdle containing gold\r\ncoins. Undoubtedly, danger or safety depends on properly placing the\r\nconducting object. It may convey the current to the vital organs or it\r\nmay ward off the stroke. Probably any line of metal parallel with the\r\nlength of the body when upright would be in some degree a protection.\r\nThe noted Dr. King once saw a military company receive a discharge of\r\nelectricity from the clouds upon their bayonets, whence their muskets\r\nconducted it to the ground without harm or any painful shock. On the\r\nother hand, a battalion of French infantry, while marching between\r\nMouzon and Stenay, June 2, 1849, was struck by lightning, and two men\r\nkilled, while about two hundred were struck to the ground. Blood flowed\r\nfrom their mouths, ears and noses. This effect appears to have been the\r\nresult of the concussion. Similar results sometimes follow from heavy\r\ndischarges of artillery.\r\n\r\nUniform testimony goes to show that men in metallic armor have never\r\nbeen fatally injured by lightning. A complete suit of metallic armor\r\nembodies the principle of the well-known electrical cage of Faraday.\r\nThis is simply a basket of wire network with its open side to the\r\nground. If the wire is of proper size and the capacity sufficient, this\r\ncage is the most effectual protection possible, unless the walls be of\r\nsolid iron.\r\n\r\nIf one places beside him a better direct conductor to the earth than his\r\nown body, he will not be fatally injured by the electric current,\r\nthough, if it pass very near, he may be blinded by the glare or deafened\r\nby the noise--effects which are usually temporary. Equal safety for\r\nbuildings may be similarly secured.\r\n\r\nGlass being so well known as an excellent non-conductor, some have been\r\nled to suppose it effectual in warding off the disruptive stroke. Hence\r\nchambers or cases of glass have actually been made for the use of\r\nindividuals who were apt to be overcome with terror during the\r\nprevalence of a thunderstorm. In this belief, also, the vane of Christ\r\nChurch in Doncaster, England, was furnished with a glass ball; but the\r\nspire was afterward struck, causing great damage. Many also think they\r\nmay sit beside a closed window in safety, but records of holes being\r\nmelted in the glass and whole windows crumbled to powder by lightning\r\nare too numerous to admit of any reliance upon such a precaution.\r\n\r\nIn the case of silken garments the evidence met with does not warrant a\r\nstatement either for or against them; yet there appears to be no reason\r\nwhy this non-conductor should be more of a safeguard than any other. No\r\ndoubt an abundance of gold and silver lace, or cloth having threads of\r\nthese metals, might prove a protection. Feather beds, too, have been\r\nregarded as places of safety, but persons have been killed by lightning\r\nwhile in bed. Dr. Franklin advised especially that the vicinity of\r\nchimneys be avoided, because lightning often enters a room by them. All\r\nmetallic bodies, mirrors and gilded ornaments, he held, should likewise\r\nbe shunned. Contact with the walls or the floor or proximity to a\r\nchandelier, a projecting gas-pipe, a position between two considerable\r\npieces or surfaces of metals, unless distant, are all hazardous.\r\nDraughts of air are also to be avoided. Bell-wires may generally be\r\nconsidered as protective, though too small to be effectual. Perhaps a\r\nhammock, in addition to the preceding precautions, will afford as much\r\nsecurity as can be derived from insulation. But in a building having\r\ncontinuous iron walls, posts or pillars from top to bottom, or in one\r\nwhich is properly supplied with conductors in other forms, all the\r\nforegoing precautions may be neglected without apprehension. Yet, as was\r\nsuggested early in this article, the great number of buildings damaged\r\nby lightning while furnished with rods has caused much distrust of this\r\nsystem of protection.\r\n\r\nFrom the large number of trees receiving the electric current it has\r\ncome to be thought by many that these may be the best protectors of\r\nbuildings if properly placed. In a case coming under my observation a\r\ntree received (or at least deflected) the current and communicated it to\r\nthe house. In many instances, however, the building is struck while tall\r\ntrees near by are untouched.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that lightning generally strikes elevated rather than\r\nlow objects, and therefore it has been thought that a building\r\nsurrounded by steeples had nothing to fear. As previously stated,\r\nhowever, the bolt sometimes selects a low object when high ones are at\r\nhand. For example, lightning fell upon a house occupied by Lord Tilney\r\nin Naples, although it was surrounded on all sides, at the distance of\r\nfour or five hundred paces, by the towers and domes of a great number of\r\nchurches, all wet with a heavy rain.\r\n\r\nIn considering the matter of protection from lightning we must bear in\r\nmind that trees, buildings, masts and other elevated points exert no\r\nattractive power on the thundercloud except in connection with the great\r\nplane where they are situated. The primary cause of the discharge is not\r\nin the metals of the building, the exact point or line in which the\r\ninsulation by the air breaks down being determined by a variety of\r\ncauses. The elevated points of a building or ship may form a channel for\r\nthe passage of the current, but it is not the only one nor the cause of\r\nthe discharge, which would take place sooner or later though the ship or\r\nbuilding were absent altogether.\r\n\r\nThere has been a difference of opinion in regard to the area protected\r\nby lightning-conductors, early notions on this point having been much\r\nexaggerated. Leroy's, in 1788, is the earliest positive statement which\r\nI have met. It is, that a conductor protects a horizontal space around\r\nit equal to somewhat more than three times the height of the metal rod\r\nabove the building to which it is attached. The physical section of the\r\nAcademy of Sciences of Paris, on being consulted by the Minister of War\r\nin 1823, expressed the opinion that a lightning-conductor protects a\r\ncircular space of which the radius is equal to the height of the rod.\r\nHere, apparently, is a wide difference, but possibly the estimates refer\r\nto different elevations. Leroy clearly intended an area at a level with\r\nthe top of the building: thus, supposing the rod to be attached to a\r\nchimney six feet in height and to rise a foot and a half above the\r\nchimney, then it would protect a radius of about ten feet on the roof.\r\nThe estimate of the Academy of Sciences speaks of the total height of\r\nthe rod, and refers to a horizontal area at the base of the measurement,\r\nwhether this began at the ground or at the top of the structure to which\r\nthe rod is attached. In this view the estimates do not differ so much as\r\nmight appear, the latter being about one-third less than that of Leroy.\r\nOther French writers estimate the area protected as having a radius of\r\ndouble the height of the rod above the highest point of the connected\r\nstructure, being twice the radius allowed by the Academy. Later\r\nphysicists have been cautious in giving figures, for experience has\r\nshown that estimates of protection are not accurately observed by the\r\ndescending bolt. For instance, when Her Majesty's corvette Dido,\r\nfurnished with the best system of conductors, was struck by lightning,\r\nthe discharge fell in a double or forked current upon the main royal\r\nmast, one of the branches striking the extreme point of the royal yard\r\narm and passing along to the conductor on the mast, while the other fork\r\nfell on the vane, spindle and truck; which last was split open. As soon\r\nas the discharge reached the conductor all damage ceased.\r\n\r\nThe practice of the best electricians has now long been to protect all\r\nangles and projections, the latter by a branch of the rod, and the\r\nformer by running a line of rod over them, having at every few feet\r\nsharp points of an inch or two in length attached to and standing out at\r\nright angles with the rod. Indeed, some go even beyond this, forming\r\npoints along the whole length of the conductors by notching the corners\r\nof a square rod with a chisel. Sometimes a rod is twisted for ornament,\r\nbut with a loss for practical uses, for in a twisted rod the electrical\r\ncurrent is retarded, and a portion of the charge is more liable to leave\r\nthe conductor.\r\n\r\nIn England, during our Revolutionary war, an active scientific\r\ndiscussion was carried on as to whether the upper end of a\r\nlightning-conductor should be sharp or blunt. \"The scientific aspect of\r\nthe question soon became lost in political acrimony, those who, with Dr.\r\nFranklin, advocated sharp conductors, being classed with him and the\r\nRevolutionary party, while those who advocated blunt conductors were\r\nheld to be loyal subjects and good citizens.\" There is a difference in\r\nthe action of a sharp conductor and one with a blunt end or terminating\r\nin a ball. In the first the point silently receives the current, while\r\nin the other the opposite electricities of the rod and cloud may meet\r\nwith explosion; but the building will not necessarily be injured from\r\nthis cause. M. Michel proposed to combine the advantages of the two\r\nsystems by having the rod terminate in a spherical enlargement from\r\nwhich should project points in various directions. This, he thought,\r\nwould lessen the danger of fusion and control the current at distances\r\nwhere it might escape other forms of terminal. Some American\r\nelectricians now use a modification of this form, surmounting the rod\r\nwith a branching tip, while others prefer the single point. The latter\r\nis the form used in the American and British navies. The vane, with its\r\nappurtenances, is sometimes made the terminal of the conductor, and\r\nshould at least always be connected.\r\n\r\nThe practice is also a good one of combining balustrades, finials and\r\nother metal-work at the tops of buildings with the system, by which\r\nprotection is rendered more complete. Especially is it important to\r\nconnect with a metallic roof at its lower edge, and with the gutters,\r\nunless the rain-conductors connect with the earth to its moist mass.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the material for conductors, copper is undoubtedly the\r\nbest, but more expensive than iron. The latter is more liable to rust,\r\nand on account of its lower conductive power is more easily melted. An\r\nelectrical explosion which only melts a copper wire would utterly\r\ndestroy an iron wire of twice the diameter of the former. In being\r\nheated a rod contracts in length, and is then liable to fracture by the\r\nshrinkage, but if of sufficient size these results are not likely to\r\noccur. An iron rod, by successively receiving an electrical discharge,\r\nis sometimes reduced in size.\r\n\r\nThe conducting power of metals likely to be found in buildings is as\r\nfollows: taking the power of lead as _one_, that of tin will be\r\n_two_--that is, tin conducts electricity twice as well as lead; iron,\r\nnearly two and a half times as well; zinc, four times; and copper,\r\ntwelve times. From this comparison of conducting power the important\r\nfact will appear that when any two of these metals are used in the same\r\nline of conduction, the one of low power should be proportionately\r\nlarger. Sir W.S. Harris--perhaps the best authority on lightning-rods\r\nin general--advises that the size of the rod, if of iron, should be\r\nthree-fourths of an inch in diameter, although he admits that probably\r\nnever in the experience of man has a rod half an inch in diameter been\r\nmelted by an electrical discharge. He regarded the extent of surface\r\nrather than quantity of metal in the conductor as the measure of its\r\npower, while many other electricians hold the contrary opinion.\r\n\r\nIt is important that the conductor should form an unbroken line\r\nthroughout its extent, otherwise there is danger that a portion of the\r\ncharge may be diverted from it. For instance: a large barn struck not\r\nlong since had a conductor at each of three corners. In order to\r\nmaintain the uniformity of the four angles of the square hip roof, a rod\r\nwas run from the main conductor down the fourth angle to the hip, where\r\nit terminated in an erect point. A heavy discharge struck the main rod\r\nat the cupola, and, descending, divided among the four branches. That on\r\nthe short branch jumped from its end to the metal sheathing along the\r\nangle of the roof, which it followed to the gutter, passing along this\r\nto one of the conductors, doing some damage on the way. Had not the\r\ncharge found a line of metal on which to continue its course from the\r\nend of the rod, it would have done greater damage, and most likely have\r\nset the building on fire.\r\n\r\nAnother point of importance is, that the connection of the joints of the\r\nrod be perfect, as explosions and fusion occur wherever the surface in\r\ncontact is less than the size of the rod, unless the latter is much\r\nlarger than necessary. The hook and the lap joints, if not very\r\ncarefully made, are liable to this objection. The best connection, no\r\ndoubt, is that of the screw coupling.\r\n\r\nThe insulation of the rod from the building is an expense not only\r\nwithout the least advantage, but the contrary. Harris (_Thunderstorms_,\r\npp. 129, 131) says: \"This practice is not only useless, but\r\ndisadvantageous, and is manifestly inconsistent with the principles on\r\nwhich conductors are applied.\" Dr. Franklin says: \"The rod may be\r\nfastened to the wall, chimney, etc., with staples of iron. The lightning\r\nwill not leave the rod to pass into the wall through these staples. It\r\nwould rather, if any were in the wall, pass out of it into the rod, to\r\nget more readily by that conductor to the earth.\" The practice may have\r\ngained vogue from an observance of the use of glass knobs as insulators\r\nof telegraph-wires. Many intelligent people have failed to apprehend the\r\nvast difference between the low tension of voltaic electricity and\r\nfrictional electricity, lightning being in the nature of the latter. The\r\nfact that when lightning strikes the telegraph-wire it jumps from the\r\nwire to the posts, often tearing in pieces half a dozen in a row, ought\r\nto be conclusive in regard to insulating lightning-rods.\r\n\r\nThe same considerations will also effectually dissipate the fallacy by\r\nwhich the horizontal lightning-rod has duped so many people in certain\r\nportions of the West; for if the wire be cut off from the\r\nground-connections (in which condition it accords with the conductor in\r\nquestion) the posts (which answer to the building thus \"protected\") must\r\nsuffer still greater damage. So far from being insulated, the rod should\r\nbe connected with all considerable masses of metal in the building,\r\nthese having also a good connection with the earth. Frequently during a\r\nthunder-shower--sometimes even on the approach of one--all metallic\r\nobjects will be electrified, and those of considerable size will often\r\nyield a spark; and this without the building containing these objects\r\nbeing struck. When struck, the larger masses of metal might occasion a\r\ndangerous explosion from induction, though at some distance from the\r\nrod: for this reason, as before stated, they should be connected with\r\nthe ground. Being then liable to receive a part of the current from the\r\nconductor in case this be too small, they should be connected with it,\r\nas otherwise the current would cause damage in its passage. In a word,\r\ntherefore, all metal bodies in a building should, as far as possible, be\r\nmade a part of the system of conduction. This matter is not well\r\nunderstood generally. A dwelling in Boston having been struck by\r\nlightning a few years since, a neighbor remarked that \"it was fortunate\r\nthe lightning did not reach the gas-pipe, for it would then have gone\r\nall over the house.\" The fact was, that the bolt did not go more than\r\nfive feet inside the house before it struck the pipe, and there all\r\ndamage ended. The idea may be novel to most people, but if the gas-or\r\nwater-pipes were carried above the roof to the usual height of\r\nlightning-rods, they would form a very efficient system of conductors so\r\nlong as they were connected with the main pipes in the street. Knowing\r\nthe destructive character of lightning when it passes through air, wood,\r\nbrick, stone or other non-conductor, people are naturally fearful of\r\nallowing the current to run through their houses. But the lion and the\r\nlamb are not more different than are the disruptive discharge while\r\npassing through a non-conductor and the same current passing through a\r\ngood conductor.\r\n\r\nThe system of lightning-conductors in use in the British navy goes\r\nthrough the woodwork of the vessel, the conductors sunk in the side of\r\nthe masts connecting with the sea through the metal bolts in the hull.\r\nAfter the terrible charge of electricity had fallen on the Chichester,\r\nCaptain Stewart wrote: \"I examined the planks about the bolts, and found\r\nall quite fair and water-tight.\" (These \"bolts\" formed the lower part of\r\nthe system of conduction, passing through the bottom of the vessel and\r\nconnecting with the water.) After twenty-five years' use there had not,\r\nas we learn from the _British Nautical Magazine_ for March, 1853, been a\r\nsolitary instance of serious damage by lightning on ships fitted with\r\nthese conductors, though many had been struck by heavy discharges. In\r\nour own navy the conductors pass from the upper part of the mast over\r\nthe side of the vessel.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, to advocate making the gas-and water-pipes the main\r\nlines of conduction that I have made these citations, but to remove in\r\nsome degree the dread of \"having the lightning come into the house.\" A\r\nbetter conductor would be the metal covering of the roof when such\r\nmaterial is used. When a good metallic connection is made between a\r\nmetal roof and metal rain-conductors, which, in their turn, are well\r\nconnected with the earth, nothing further is needed for complete\r\nprotection than a rod soldered to the roof for each chimney or other\r\nprojection. But as the lightning is liable to melt the plate at the\r\npoint where it enters, especially if the metal be tin or zinc, it is\r\nwell to solder points at the angles. Some, \"to make assurance doubly\r\nsure,\" carry the rods over the whole distance quite to the ground in\r\naddition. All authorities consider such a system as this to be as\r\ncomplete a defence against lightning as possible.\r\n\r\n\"If,\" says Harris, \"a building or a ship were perfectly metallic in all\r\nits parts, no damage could possibly arise to it when struck by\r\nlightning, since the explosive action would vanish the instant the\r\nelectrical agency entered the metal. In applying lightning-conductors,\r\ntherefore, as a means of guarding against the destructive effects of\r\nlightning, our object should be to carry out this principle in all its\r\ngenerality, and bring the building or ship as nearly as possible into\r\nthat state of passive electrical resistance it would have supposing the\r\nwhole mass were iron throughout.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the most careful and extended inquiry possible to him, it is the\r\nwriter's conclusion that in nearly every case of serious damage by\r\nlightning to a building having conductors of any well-known system\r\n(except the horizontal, which is not a conductor at all in the usual\r\nsense of the word), the failure to protect has been on account of a\r\n_defective ground-connection_. The fact is the more surprising as this\r\nconnection is so much within control and is the least costly part of the\r\nsystem. This fault has arisen from the failure of lightning-rod men, as\r\nwell as owners of buildings, to apprehend what constitutes a\r\nground-connection for electricity. If the eye sees the end of the\r\nconductor pass a short distance beneath the surface, all the connection\r\nnecessary is thought to be effected, because \"the ground is always wet\r\nenough in a shower.\" In the cities it is customary to connect the rod\r\nwith the water-or gas-pipes in the street, which makes the conduction\r\nperfect. In the absence of these it is best to carry the rod to a well;\r\nand it is always desirable to enlarge the lower end of the conductor,\r\nwhich may be done by soldering it there to a sheet of copper. If the\r\ntermination of the line cannot be carried to a well, it should be\r\ndeeply buried in a bed of coke or charcoal that has been subjected to a\r\nred heat.\r\n\r\nA season or two ago a large barn in the vicinity of Boston was struck by\r\nlightning, and though there were rods at three of the four corners,\r\nthree kine were killed by the discharge. The barn stood upon the side of\r\na hill, having a cellar and sub-cellar, the bottom of the last being\r\nvery moist. An ox stood in one corner, a cow in another and a heifer at\r\na third, and each received a fatal stroke. On examination it was found\r\nthat the rods entered the ground to the depth of only about one foot,\r\nand the soil, being dry, perfectly insulated them. Consequently, on the\r\nway to damp earth the currents jumped to the nearest conductors, which\r\nhappened to be these unfortunate animals. In placing conductors it must\r\nnot be forgotten that dry earth in general is not a conductor. Neither\r\nwill any small quantity of surface water serve to check the rage of the\r\nelectric stroke, unless there is a connection of moisture with the mass\r\nof moisture below the soil.\r\n\r\nThe depth to which lightning may penetrate before it is so dissipated as\r\nto lose its dangerous character is shown by the fulgurites, or\r\n\"lightning-tubes,\" sometimes found in sandy soils. Their formation has\r\nbeen conclusively traced to disruptive electrical discharges from the\r\nclouds, which have melted the sand by the intense heat generated in\r\npassing through to a moist earth. These tubes generally divide into\r\nprongs, like a parsnip, as they descend. The inner surface is smooth and\r\nvery bright. It scratches glass and strikes fire as a flint. They are\r\nsometimes found three inches in external diameter, and extending to a\r\ndepth of thirty feet. In one instance five of these tubes were found in\r\na single hill.\r\n\r\nThis tendency of certain localities to receive the electrical discharge\r\nis further illustrated by the number of times certain buildings in every\r\nconsiderable town have been struck. As before stated, the elevation of\r\nthe structure does not seem to be the determining influence in directing\r\nthe stroke, for the unfortunate edifice often stands much lower than\r\nsome others in the vicinity which have always been struck. Numerous\r\nillustrations of this can be found in the records of European countries.\r\nHollis Street Church in Boston has been struck several times, though the\r\nground on which it stands is but little above the level of the sea,\r\nwhile the State-House, on the very apex of Beacon Hill, with great\r\nquantities of metal in surface and mass, is not known ever to have\r\nreceived a disruptive discharge. It has been supposed that the copper\r\ncovering of the roof, including the gilded dome, its rain-pipes and four\r\nexcellent lightning-rods, have had the effect of neutralizing the air\r\nabout it by constant conduction of mild currents. Yet the rod on the\r\nspire of Somerset Street Church, nearby and eastward of the State-House,\r\nbut lower, has been seen to receive a disruptive discharge. Bunker Hill\r\nMonument, about a mile north-west and some twenty feet higher, has\r\nseveral times received powerful discharges, which a good conductor has\r\nalways carried harmlessly away.\r\n\r\nThere has also been observed a tendency of the current not only to\r\nstrike certain buildings, but to enter the earth at a certain point\r\nwhenever such buildings are struck. Some of our oldest and most\r\nsuccessful appliers of rods believe that at certain points there are\r\nnatural electric currents, or at least readier conduction for them than\r\nat others. Yet these points can become known only by repeated disasters.\r\nLightning-rod men who are adepts in their business now take care to\r\novercome adverse currents by enlarging the lower part of the conductors\r\nand by carrying them to greater depth.\r\n\r\nSoon after the powder-magazine of the Boston Navy Yard was completed the\r\nneighboring residents grew fearful, and petitioned the authorities that\r\nit should be better protected from lightning. It had already four\r\nexcellent rods, one at each corner of the building; but to these\r\npeaceful and unwarlike citizens every thunderstorm was a great battle in\r\nwhich their homes were in danger of destruction and their own lives in\r\njeopardy. The result of their action was, that a trench four feet deep\r\nwas dug entirely around the magazine, and in its bottom was laid a\r\ncontinuous line of sheet copper four inches in width: to this the plate\r\nof each rod was soldered, and then the soil was replaced.[6] No one\r\ncould doubt now that the stealthy upward stroke would be caught and the\r\nmysterious earth-currents overcome. It is supposed that thenceforth the\r\ntremors of the good citizens ceased. The massive magazine with its fiery\r\ncontents yet stands, though terrible peals of thunder have shaken it and\r\nfearful bolts have fallen near.\r\n\r\n  GEORGE J. VARNEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[5] Among other beliefs in regard to lightning is that of the upward\r\nstroke. It has even found expression in the _American Journal of Science\r\nand Arts_. On careful consideration of the cases offered in support,\r\nboth printed and unprinted, I find that every one is susceptible of a\r\nreasonable explanation without this theory.\r\n\r\n[6] It is not usual that the body of moisture can be reached so near the\r\nsurface, but this magazine is situated on low ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEA'S SECRET.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Just as it is, it hath been, love, I know--\r\n          So long ago\r\n    That time and place have faded: I forget\r\n    What rivers ran, what hills closed round us; yet\r\n    Thus much my soul remembers: thou and I\r\n    Saw the sun's rise and set, felt life slip by.\r\n\r\n    And then it was that first the deep-voiced sea\r\n          Sang low to thee and me\r\n    Its ancient secrets by the lonely shore;\r\n    And we two watched the strange birds dip and soar\r\n    Between the fading sea-line, far and dim,\r\n    And the white dazzle of the sands' long rim.\r\n\r\n    All that thou saidst--all that we heard and told\r\n          In some lost language old--\r\n    Has perished like the speech; yet _this_ remains:\r\n    From the vast desert of the ocean-plains\r\n    A great moon climbing, with a dull red glare\r\n    Like smouldering fire, far up the purple air.\r\n\r\n    And then--I cannot grasp it--yet I _know_\r\n          That something, long ago,\r\n    Held fast thy soul to mine with cords of pain\r\n    And marvellous joy, and love's sweet loss and gain.\r\n    All save that love the years have swept away--\r\n    A thousand years, a single yesterday!\r\n\r\n    But when my soul dreams, by the lonely sea,\r\n          Back to eternity,\r\n    I hear an echo, through its hollow moan,\r\n    From those lost lives drowned in the centuries gone:\r\n    I catch the haunting memory, and I know\r\n    The secret that you told me long ago.\r\n\r\n    G.A.

It\r\nunites within itself all those attractions which have made Florida\r\nfamous--all but river and lake: it has the balmiest climate in the\r\nSouth; the vegetation of its forests is semi-tropical; it has game in\r\nabundance. It has all these, and yet its territory is now a waste.\r\n\r\nIn November I visited it, and again in April, and later in August. To\r\nreach it one must go first to St. Mary's, the town farthest south on the\r\nGeorgia coast, or to Fernandina, the northernmost city in Florida. In\r\neither case he will have to hire a boat and a boatman, and in either\r\ncase he must carry with him his provisions.\r\n\r\nSt. Mary's in April is St. Mary's in August--a drowsy, quaint old town,\r\nwarm in the daytime and cool at night; hot in the sunlight, but with\r\ncool sea-breezes. The streets of St. Mary's are her glory: they are one\r\nhundred feet wide, carpeted with a green sward smooth as a shaven lawn,\r\nlined with live-oaks and china trees. In April the latter are in full\r\nbloom, their lilac blossoms hanging in dense panicles, the green leaves\r\nflecking them just enough to afford contrast, and the sombre Spanish\r\nmoss depending gracefully from every branch and limb. Great gaudy\r\nbutterflies are continually hovering over them and fluttering uneasily\r\nfrom flower to flower, and gleaming humming-birds, our own Northern\r\nsummer visitors (the _Trochilus colubris_), are flashing from tree to\r\ntree, now poised a moment in air, now sipping honey from the tiny cups.\r\n\r\nFrom the lighthouse dome at Fernandina one can look over half the\r\nisland, trace the white sand-beach miles to the south--follow it north\r\ntill it curves inland where Amelia Sound, the mouth of the St. Mary's\r\nRiver, forms the harbor. Away north runs up Cumberland Beach, and among\r\nthe trees and over a broad stretch of marsh gleam white the ruins of\r\n\"Dungeness.\" West, again, one sees the gloomy pines of the main land,\r\nbehind which the sun goes down, lighting gloriously the marsh and silver\r\nthreads of the river.\r\n\r\nUnlike the seasons of the North, there is here no perceptible line of\r\ndemarcation between them. We cannot positively assert that spring has\r\nopened or summer or winter begun. As for autumn and harvest-time, the\r\ncrops are being continually gathered in. So since the year came in I\r\nhave seen various plants and shrubs in bloom that ought to open with\r\nspring. Up the Ocklawaha in January I saw the blackberry or dewberry in\r\nblossom; and ever since, along the St. John's in that month and\r\nFebruary, on the banks of the St. Mary's in February and March, and even\r\nhere, in Fernandina and St. Mary's, it is blossoming and bearing fruit.\r\nIt is this week--the first week in April--that we obtained the first\r\nfruit for the table, buying it for ten cents a quart. It puzzles one to\r\nthink of planting. When must he begin? Last Christmas one of our\r\ntruck-farmers had a large crop of peas ready to harvest: a chance frost\r\ngobbled them up, however: now (April) peas and potatoes are in their\r\nprime.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of April the china trees have dropped their blossoms, and\r\nthe streets beneath are strewn with withered flowers. The fragrance that\r\nfilled the air has departed with the humming-birds and butterflies. The\r\npomegranate still continues in bloom: its vividly-scarlet flowers have\r\ndelighted us ever since the middle of March. The figs commenced leafing\r\nwith the month: now they are green with broad leaves, and in the axil of\r\neach appears the rudiment of a fruit. They are grotesquely gnarled and\r\ntwisted, taking most unthought-of shapes and positions. The\r\nmocking-birds have mated and begun the construction of their nests.\r\nTheir music is delightful: nearly all the day long they sing, and\r\nsometimes in the night. It seems almost wicked--to mercenary man--to\r\nthink that birds worth twenty-five dollars apiece are freely fluttering\r\nabout unharmed. When the breeding season has opened, however, it will\r\nnot close without some family of mocking-birds being made desolate, for\r\nthe young Ethiopian hath an ear for music, and most eagerly seeketh the\r\nyoung bird in its downy nest, trusting to the unsuspecting Yankee for\r\nremuneration therefor.\r\n\r\nThe month went out in glorious style: every morning of its thirty days\r\nhad opened with unclouded sky, and each night's sun went down with a\r\nblaze of glory that flooded the marshes with golden light and left\r\npainted on the sky clouds of royal purple and crimson. Two or three\r\nshowers sprang upon us in the afternoon, ending after a stay of an hour\r\nor two, cooling the air and refreshing weary man most wonderfully. Plums\r\nand peaches are nearly grown and turning color. They afford another\r\nillustration of the dilatory motions of vegetation here. In January I\r\nleft some plum trees in full bloom: returning a month later, I found the\r\nsame trees still white with flowers. The peaches were pink with bloom in\r\nFebruary and March, and even in April some blushing flowers appear.\r\n\r\nThis was Fernandina and St. Mary's in April: in August the latter town\r\nhad changed but little. The streets were as green as in early spring:\r\nthe flowers were fewer, but the air was heavy with the fragrance of\r\ncrape-myrtle and orange. It was hot in the morning, but an early breeze\r\nfrom the ocean soon came in, blowing with refreshing coolness all day\r\nlong. It was even pleasanter than in spring and winter, the air clearer\r\nand more bracing, and annoying insects had disappeared.\r\n\r\nSt. Mary's is intimately connected with Cumberland Island in history. In\r\nthe war of 1812 the island was taken, and the slaves were offered their\r\nfreedom by Admiral Cockburn; but such was their attachment to the place\r\nand their masters that but one availed himself of this opportunity to\r\nescape. At Point Peter, where the main land of Georgia terminates in\r\nthe marshes of St. Mary's, a fight occurred, and there are yet the\r\nremains of an earthwork thrown up by the Americans to repulse the\r\nBritish fleet in its advance on St. Mary's.\r\n\r\nThe oldest inhabitant of St. Mary's, who is said to have scored a\r\ncentury, old \"Daddy Paddy\"--a negro who bears in his face the tattooing\r\nof his native Africa--participated in that fight. He lives in a little\r\ncabin on a street by the wharf, and devotes his time to fishing, at\r\nwhich he is very expert. Upon being questioned regarding the fight, he\r\nseemed rather hazy as to dates, but was positive as to the time he first\r\nsaw America: \"De wah ob de rebenue was jes' clar' peace when I land at\r\nCharleston from Afriky. Was young man den, jes' growd. No, sah, nebah\r\nsaw Gin'l Wash'tun, but heah ob him, sah: he fout wid de British, sah,\r\nan' gain de vic'try at New Orleans, sah.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was General Jackson, uncle.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sah! Gin'l Jackson mout ha' ben thar, but Gin'l Wash'tun, he hab a\r\nhan' in it. Yes, sah, I'se de fust settlah, sah: was in St. Mary's afo'\r\na street was laid out [in 1787], an' 'twas all bay-gall an' hammock.\"\r\n\r\nThe Indian name of Cumberland Island was Missoe (\"beautiful land\"), and\r\nthis was changed when Oglethorpe visited the island, at the request of\r\nan Indian chief who had received some kindness from the duke of\r\nCumberland. It is related in an old English record, of which I have seen\r\na copy, that the duke was so well pleased at this evidence of good-will\r\nthat he caused a hunting-lodge to be erected there, and named it\r\nDungeness, after his country-seat, Castle Dungeness, on the cape of\r\nDungeness in the county of Kent. From that time until the breaking out\r\nof the Revolution it was \"owned successively by peers of the British\r\nrealm.\"\r\n\r\nThe island is eighteen miles in length and from half a mile to three\r\nmiles in breadth. The soil is sandy, adapted to the culture of cotton,\r\ncorn, potatoes, etc.: pomegranates, olives, dates, figs, limes, lemons,\r\noranges and melons yield abundant crops. The great frost of 1835, which\r\nextended over the entire peninsula of Florida, destroyed the fine groves\r\nof orange trees: at one time this fruit was shipped in schooner-loads,\r\nand from one tree three thousand oranges have been gathered. The forest\r\ntrees are live-oak, cedar and a few pines. A most interesting fact in\r\nthe history of the island is found in its chronicles, for here were\r\nobtained the timbers for the Constitution (Old Ironsides), that noble\r\nfrigate so well known to every American. Some of the stumps of the\r\nindestructible live-oak from which the timber was cut for her ribs may\r\nyet be seen. Deer, raccoons, bear and 'possum are abundant in the thick\r\nforest. The climate is temperate and healthy: many of the former slaves\r\nlive to a great age. The island has never been afflicted by fever: while\r\nthe town of Brunswick, to the north, and Fernandina, just across the\r\nchannel to the south, have been scourged by Yellow Jack, Cumberland has\r\never remained untouched. St. Mary's, across the marshes on the main\r\nland, also boasts this immunity.\r\n\r\nThe creeks of the marshes swarm with fish of every sort, and there are\r\noyster-beds containing large and toothsome bivalves. With 'possums and\r\n'coons, fish and oysters, is it strange that Cuffie clung to his old\r\nhome long after his master had left it? is it a matter of wonder that\r\nthere yet remains a remnant of the old slave population, houseless and\r\npoverty-stricken, clinging to the island that once gave them so\r\ndelightful a home? At the close of the war, it is related, Mr. Stafford,\r\nproprietor of the central portion of the island, burned his negro houses\r\nto the ground, telling his people to go, as he had no more use for them\r\nnor they for him. Cumberland to-day is nearly depopulated, the fertile\r\ncotton-and corn-fields run to waste, and wild hogs and half-wild horses\r\nroam over the pasture and scrub that cover once-cultivated fields.\r\n\r\nThe history of this island commences with that of Georgia. We read that\r\nin 1742 the Spaniards invaded Georgia and landed on the island. With a\r\nfleet of thirty-six sail and with more than three thousand troops from\r\nHavana and St. Augustine, they entered the harbor of St. Simons, north\r\nof Cumberland, and erected a battery of twenty guns. General Oglethorpe,\r\nwith eight hundred men, exclusive of Indians, was then on the island. He\r\nwithdrew to his fort at Frederica, and anxiously awaited reinforcements\r\nfrom Carolina. By turning to account the desertion of a French soldier\r\nhe precipitated the attack of the Spaniards, and on their march to\r\nFrederica they fell into an ambuscade. Great slaughter ensued, and they\r\nretreated precipitately. The place of conflict is to this day known as\r\n\"Bloody Marsh.\" The Spaniards retreated south along the coast in their\r\nvessels, and on their way attacked Fort William, at the southern\r\nextremity of Cumberland Island, but were repulsed with loss. This fort,\r\nwhich was constructed, I think, by Oglethorpe, is placed on the extreme\r\nsouthern end of Cumberland in a map of the island made in 1802. Even\r\nthen the fort was half submerged at high water, and at the present day\r\nits site is far out in the channel. The water of the river-mouth is\r\nconstantly encroaching upon the land, and the ruins of a house once\r\nstanding upon the southern point may be seen, it is said, beneath the\r\nwater at low tide. Old Fort William has been seen within the memory of\r\nresidents of St. Mary's, but likewise beneath the waves.\r\n\r\nAbout 1770 that rare naturalist and botanist, William Bartram, landed\r\nhere and traversed the island, being set across to Amelia Island\r\n(Fernandina) by a hunter whom he found living here. He was then at the\r\ncommencement of his romantic journeyings among the Seminole Indians up\r\nthe St. John's River, then running through a wilderness. Another\r\nfortification, Fort St. Andrew, situated on the north-west point of the\r\nisland, may still be traced by the ruins of its walls. A well is known\r\nthere into which, it is said, the English threw ten thousand pounds in\r\nsilver upon the approach of the Spaniards. In this way, by vestiges of\r\nfoundation-walls, are indicated the various settlements of the\r\nisland--mansions and cabins that have passed away, leaving no other sign\r\nbut these sad memorials of the past.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of peace, and immediately after the close of the\r\nRevolution, the southern portion of Cumberland Island came into the\r\npossession of General Nathaniel Greene. It is said by some to have been\r\npresented to him by the State of Georgia in connection with the\r\nbeautiful estate of Mulberry Grove, where he removed with his family and\r\ntook up his residence. His lamentably premature death prevented the\r\nconsummation of his design to build here a retreat in which to spend the\r\nhot summer months. He had resided but a year upon his estate of Mulberry\r\nGrove, and had hardly commenced to beautify and adorn this chosen\r\nresidence of his maturer years, when a sun-stroke cut him down in the\r\nprime of his life.\r\n\r\nThe general had selected the site of the mansion to be built at\r\nDungeness, and had planned the grounds, laid out a garden--which\r\nsubsequently became famous for its tropical products and roses--and had\r\nlined through the forests of live-oak those avenues which have since\r\ngrown to such magnificent proportions. As has been related, he did not\r\nlive to see the completion of his work, but died almost at its very\r\ninception. In 1786 the year of his death, the foundation-walls were laid\r\nof the mansion-home of Dungeness, but the building was not finished till\r\n1803. Even after it had been occupied for years, and during the sixty\r\nyears and more it was used as a residence by the descendants of General\r\nGreene, there remained a few unfinished rooms. A tradition in the family\r\nto the effect that some great misfortune would befall it if the building\r\nwere finished prevented, it is said, its completion. In the early part\r\nof the present century it was the most elegant residence on the coast.\r\n\r\nA mound of shells, the accumulation of centuries and the result of\r\ncountless Indian feasts, rose high above the southern marsh of\r\nCumberland. A forest of live-oaks surrounded it on three sides, and at\r\nits feet ran the broad creek which wound through the marsh for miles,\r\nseeking the Sound at a point opposite the Florida shore. Here, for ages\r\nof time, the Indians of the South had resorted to feast upon the\r\noysters with which the creek was filled. The Creek Indians--the most\r\nhonorable with whom the United States ever had dealings, from whom\r\nsprang the Seminoles, and who occupied the entire territory of Georgia\r\nand Carolina at the period of the white man's advent--were the last who\r\naided in the erection of this monument to a race now passed away. The\r\nsummit of this shell-mound was levelled for the site of the house, and a\r\nterraced area of an acre or more constructed with the shells. Upon this\r\nbase, raised above the general level of the island, its foundations were\r\nlaid. It was four stories in height above the basement, and from\r\ncellar-stone to eaves was forty-five feet. There were four chimneys and\r\nsixteen fireplaces, and twenty rooms above the first floor. The walls at\r\nthe base were six feet in thickness, and above the ground four feet.\r\nThey were composed of the material known as \"tabby,\" a mixture of\r\nshells, lime and broken stone or gravel with water; which mass, being\r\npressed in a mould of boards, becomes when dry as hard and durable as\r\nrock. The walls are now as solid as stone itself. The second story above\r\nthe terrace contained the principal rooms: the room in the south-east\r\ncorner was the drawing-room in the time of the Shaws and the\r\nNightingales. The room immediately back of the drawing-room, in the\r\nnorth-east corner, was the dining-room: a wide hall ran through the\r\ncentre, upon the opposite side of which were two rooms, used\r\nrespectively as school- and sewing-room. Above these apartments, in the\r\nthird story, were the chambers. That directly above the drawing-room is\r\nthe most interesting of all, for it was occupied by General Harry Lee,\r\nwho was confined there by sickness, and there died. The interior of the\r\nhouse corresponded with its exterior in beauty of finish and\r\nmagnificence of decoration and appointments.\r\n\r\nEnclosed by a high wall of masonry (the \"tabby\" just described) was a\r\ntract of twelve acres devoted to the cultivation of flowers and tropical\r\nfruits. This wall, now broken down in places and overgrown with ivy-and\r\ntrumpet-vines, yet divides the garden from the larger fields once\r\ndevoted to cotton and cane. The gardener's house was next the mansion,\r\nand joined to it by this high wall. The garden lay to the south,\r\nreaching the marsh in successive terraces. On and about the semicircular\r\nterrace immediately around the house were planted crape-myrtle, clove\r\ntrees and sago-palms: some yet remain to indicate what an Eden-like\r\nretreat was this garden of spices and bloom half a century ago. The\r\nfirst broad terrace, which ran the entire length of the garden-wall east\r\nand west, was divided by an avenue of olives, which separated in front\r\nof the house, leaving a space in which were two noble magnolias. A broad\r\nwalk ran from the house to the lower garden, which was divided from the\r\nother by a thick-set hedge of mock-orange: in this garden was another\r\nwalk bordered by olives. This space was entirely devoted to flowers: on\r\neach side was a grove of orange trees, and in the lower garden were the\r\nfig, India-rubber and date-palm, the golden date of Africa. Of trees\r\nthere were the camphor tree, coffee, Portuguese laurel, \"tree of\r\nParadise,\" crape-myrtle, guava, lime, orange, citron, pomegranate,\r\nsago-palm and many others whose home is in the tropics. The delicious\r\nclimate of this island, several degrees warmer than that of the main\r\nland in the same latitude, enabled the proprietors of this insular\r\nParadise to grow nearly all the fruits of the torrid zone.\r\n\r\nA little tongue of land runs from the garden into the marsh, an\r\nelevation of the original shell-mound, covered with oaks hung with long\r\ngray moss. This was called \"The Park,\" and here the inhabitants of this\r\nfavored estate would resort for recreation in the afternoon and evening.\r\nNear this strip of land, beneath the shade of an immense live-oak,\r\nluxuriates a clump of West India bamboo, said to have originated from a\r\nsingle stalk brought here by General Lee. The feathery lances clash and\r\nrattle with all the wild abandon characteristic of them in their native\r\nisles. I have not seen a more perfect group outside the islands of the\r\nCaribbean Sea.\r\n\r\nFrom the walls of the second story--if you wish to view the\r\nwide-extended prospect to the south you must clamber there--you can look\r\nacross three thousand acres of salt marsh to Fernandina and St. Mary's,\r\nalong the river and beach, across miles of ocean. Ivy climbs the corner\r\nwall of the ruins and covers garden-wall and trees. Ruin everywhere\r\nstares you in the face: on every side are deserted fields and\r\ngardens--fields that employed the labor of four hundred negroes; fields\r\nthat were fertile and yielded large crops of the famous \"Sea-Island\r\ncotton.\" Bales from this estate were never \"sampled.\" The Sea-Island\r\ncotton that took the prize at the World's Fair in London was raised on\r\nthis island.\r\n\r\nEast of the garden, stretching toward the ocean-beach, is the\r\nolive-grove. Seventy years ago the first olive trees were imported from\r\nItaly and the south of France. They grew and flourished, and years ago\r\nthis grove yielded a profit to its owners. In 1755, Mr. Henry Laurens of\r\nSouth Carolina imported and planted olives, capers, limes, ginger, etc.,\r\nand in 1785 the olive was successfully grown in South Carolina; but\r\nprobably there is not at the present day a grove equal in extent to\r\nthis. It was estimated that a large tree would average a gallon of oil\r\nper year: there were eight hundred planted and brought to a flourishing\r\nand profitable stage of growth. There are several hundred now, scattered\r\nthrough a waste of briers and scrub and overgrown with moss.\r\n\r\nBut the avenues? In the hottest day there are shade and coolness beneath\r\nthe intertwined branches of the live-oaks that arch above them. The eye\r\nis refreshed in gazing down these vistas over the leaf-strewn floors of\r\nsand. The sunshine sifts through the arch above, flecking the roadway\r\nwith a mosaic of leaves and boughs in light and shade. From the limbs\r\nhang graceful pennons of Spanish moss, festooned at the sides, waved by\r\nevery wind, changing in every light. Grapevines with stems six inches in\r\ndiameter climb into the huge oaks and swing from tree to tree, linking\r\nlimb with limb: the tree-tops are purple with great fruit-clusters. To\r\nthe whole scene the dwarf palmetto gives a semi-tropic aspect. There\r\nare no signs of life, save a lizard darting over the leaves, stopping\r\nmidway to look at you with bright eyes. In the evening the squirrels\r\ncome out in countless numbers, and their crashing leaps may be heard in\r\nall directions; bright cardinal-birds, Florida jays and gay nonpareils\r\nenliven the gloom; the jays chatter in the branches and mocking-birds\r\ncarol from the topmost limbs. It is one of the joys of earth to walk\r\nthrough the Grand Avenue of Dungeness at sunset.\r\n\r\nThere were, when the estate was in prosperous condition, eleven miles of\r\navenues, seven miles of beach, eight miles of walks and nine miles of\r\nopen roads. Grand Avenue, running midway the length of the island, was\r\ncleared eighteen miles, to High Point. There are now but three miles\r\ncleared, but you can look straight down beneath the arch of live-oaks\r\nfor more than a mile of its length. From the Sound to the beach,\r\ncrossing Central Avenue, ran River Avenue for a distance of about a\r\nmile.\r\n\r\nThis live-oak forest, which covers several thousand acres, is densely\r\nfilled with scrub palmetto, impenetrable almost, and so difficult to\r\npierce that the deer with which the forest swarms choose the old paths\r\nand roadways in their walks from sleeping- to feeding-grounds. The\r\nhunters take advantage of this, and after starting their dogs in the\r\nscrub post themselves on the main avenues where the paths intersect, and\r\nshoot the deer as they jump out. The deer of the island are estimated by\r\nthousands, and a State law which prohibits the hunting of deer with\r\ndogs, except with the owner's permission, has aided in their increase.\r\nHalfway up the island are numerous ponds, to which ducks resort in the\r\nwinter in vast numbers. Bear are plentiful in the deep woods, and their\r\ntracks, with those of the deer in greater abundance, are often found\r\ncrossing the abandoned fields.\r\n\r\nThree hundred feet in width, hard as stone, shell-strewn, between\r\nwind-hollowed sand-dunes and foaming surf, this beach of Cumberland\r\nstretches for twenty miles. The sands that border it are covered with a\r\nnetwork of beautiful convolvulus, tufts of sea-oats with nodding plumes,\r\nand picturesque clumps of Spanish bayonet (_Yucca gloriosa_) with\r\npyramids of snowy flowers. This and the prickly pear suggest the climate\r\nof the tropics. I find them on the sandhills bordering the ocean-beach,\r\nthe wind-swept dunes between the \"beach-hammock\" and the hard sand of\r\nthe wave-washed beach. They are called barren by many, these sandhills\r\nof the Atlantic coast, but I never find them so. To me they are always\r\nattractive, whether I am traversing the sand-slopes of Cape Cod or the\r\nsimilar ones of Florida. Even the grasses possess a character of their\r\nown--gracefully erect, tiny circles traced about them where the last\r\nwind has caused them to brush the sand. Here too are grasses rare and\r\nbeautiful--the feathery fox-tail, the tall, loose-branched sea-oats, and\r\nmany others with names unknown, which you may see ornamenting the famous\r\npalmetto hats.\r\n\r\nSo fascinating are these sand-dunes that one wanders among them for\r\nhours, following in the paths worn by the feet of cattle which roam\r\nthese hills and the neighboring marsh in a half-wild state. Sometimes\r\nthe banks will shelve abruptly, hollowed out by the wind, and one can\r\nlook down into a hole ten or twenty feet deep, arched over by\r\nthorn-bushes, grapevines and a species of bay. These sand-caverns are of\r\nfrequent occurrence. There are clumps of scrubby oak completely covered\r\nwith scarlet honeysuckle and trumpet-flower. While seeking to\r\ninvestigate one of these I startled a hen-quail, which, after whirring\r\nrapidly out of sight, returned and manifested much anxiety by plaintive\r\ncalls. This is a queer place for quail: in the neighborhood of old\r\nfields, where they can easily run out and glean a hasty meal from weeds\r\nand broken ground, is their chosen place for a nest.\r\n\r\nAlong the surface of the sea long lines of pelicans pursue a lumbering\r\nflight; graceful terns (sea-swallows) skim the waves; a great blue heron\r\nstalks across the hard sand, majestic, solitary and shy of man's\r\napproach; and dainty little beach-birds, piping plover in snowy white\r\nand drab, glide rapidly past the surf-line. A mile below Beach Avenue is\r\na high sandhill shelving abruptly toward the beach, half-buried trees\r\nprojecting from its western slope: it is now known as \"Eagle Cliff,\" so\r\ncalled by the proprietor of Dungeness from the fact of my shooting an\r\neagle there one day in November.\r\n\r\nIn the beach-hammock are the same wind-hollowed hills, rooted into\r\npermanence by twisted oaks and magnolias. Upon their limbs in April the\r\nSpanish moss and air-plants were just blossoming, the former into little\r\nstar-like, hardly-discernible flowers, the latter throwing up a green\r\nstem with a pink terminal bud, which in August had burst into a spike of\r\ncrimson flowers. Curious lichens cover the rough trunks of these\r\noaks--some gray, some ashy-white, some pink, some scarlet like blotches\r\nof blood. The _Mitchella_, the little partridge-berry, is here in bloom,\r\nand has been since the year came in.\r\n\r\nThe marsh that borders the beach-hammock and spreads a sea of silvery\r\ngreen before the mansion is not barren of attractions. Inquisitive and\r\nfaint-hearted fiddler-crabs are darting in and out of their holes in the\r\nmud: an alligator now and then shows a hint of a head above the water of\r\nthe creek, along whose banks walk daintily and proudly egrets and herons\r\nrobed in white, and from the reeds of which myriads of water-hens send\r\nup a deafening chatter.\r\n\r\nMidway between the mansion and the beach, in the southern corner of the\r\norchard of olive trees, which overhang and surround it, is the graveyard\r\nof the family. It is the last object to which in this narrative I call\r\nattention, but to the visitor it is the most interesting, the fullest of\r\nmemories of the past. By a winding and secluded path from the deserted\r\ngarden, along the banks of the solitary marsh, beneath great water-oaks\r\nhung with funereal moss, one reaches this little cemetery, a few roods\r\nof ground walled in from the adjoining copsewood--\r\n\r\n    A lonesome acre, thinly grown\r\n    With grass and wandering vines.\r\n\r\nThree tombs and three headstones indicate at least six of the graves\r\nwith which this little lot is filled. In one of these graves rest the\r\nbones of her who shared the fortunes of the gallant general, the\r\n\"Washington of the South,\" when he rested after the last decisive battle\r\nand retired to his Georgia plantation. In another lies buried his\r\ndaughter, and in another the gallant \"Light-Horse Harry,\" who so ably\r\nassisted him at Eutaw Springs--the brave and eloquent Lee. Upon the\r\nfirst marble slab is engraven, \"In memory of Catherine Miller (widow of\r\nthe late Major-General Nathaniel Greene, Commander-in-Chief of the\r\nAmerican Revolutionary Army in the Southern Department in 1783), who\r\ndied Sept. 2d, 1814, aged 59 years. She possessed great talents and\r\nexalted virtues.\" Phineas Miller, Esq., a native of Connecticut and a\r\ngraduate of Yale College, who had been engaged by General Greene as\r\nlaw-tutor to his son, managed the widow's estates after the general's\r\ndeath, and later married her. His grave is here, though unmarked by any\r\nstone.\r\n\r\nAnd this name revives the memory of one of the greatest inventions of\r\nthe eighteenth century. Eli Whitney, the inventor of the cotton-gin, was\r\nborn in Westborough, Massachusetts, December 8, 1765. In 1792 he\r\nobtained a position as tutor to the children of a Georgia planter, but\r\nowing to the imperfect postal regulations his letter of acceptance was\r\nnot received, and on arriving in Savannah he found his place occupied by\r\nanother. Without means or friends, he was in great want, when his\r\ncircumstances became known to Mrs. Greene (then residing at Mulberry\r\nGrove), who, being a lady of benevolent heart, invited him to make her\r\nhouse his home until he should find remunerative employment.\r\n\r\nOne day, while this lady was engaged in working a sort of embroidery\r\ncalled \"tambour-work,\" she complained to young Whitney that the frame\r\nshe was using was too rough and tore the delicate threads. Anxious to\r\ngratify his benefactress, Whitney quickly constructed a frame so\r\nsuperior in every respect that she thought it a great invention. It\r\nchanced shortly after that a party of gentlemen, many of them old\r\nfriends and officers who had served under General Greene, met at her\r\nhouse, and were discussing the merits and profits of cotton, which had\r\nbeen lately introduced into the State. One of them remarked that unless\r\nsome machine could be devised for removing the seed it would never be a\r\nprofitable crop (the cleaning of one pound of cotton being then a day's\r\nwork). Mrs. Greene, who heard the remark, replied that a young man, a\r\nMr. Whitney, then in her house, could probably help them. She then sent\r\nfor Whitney, introduced him, extolled his genius and commended him to\r\ntheir friendship. He set to work under great disadvantages, having to\r\nmake his tools, and even his wires, which at that time could not be had\r\nin Savannah. By Mrs. Greene and Mr. Miller he was furnished with\r\nabundant means wherewith to complete his machine. It was first exhibited\r\nprivately to a select company, but it could not long remain a secret,\r\nand its fame, which spread rapidly throughout the South, was the cause\r\nof great excitement. The shop containing the model was broken open and\r\nthe machine was stolen: by this means the public became possessed of the\r\nsecret, and before another could be made a number of machines were in\r\nsuccessful operation.\r\n\r\nA partnership was entered into between Miller and Whitney, and in 1793 a\r\nlarge area was planted with cotton in expectation that the new gin would\r\nenable them to market it at little expense. In 1795 their shops, which\r\nhad been removed to New Haven, were destroyed by fire, thus reducing the\r\nfirm to the verge of bankruptcy. The faith and energy of Mr. Miller are\r\nwell shown in the following letter, written from Dungeness to Whitney in\r\nNew Haven: \"I think we ought to meet such events with equanimity. We are\r\npursuing a valuable object by honorable means, and I believe our\r\nmeasures are such as are justified by virtue and morality. It has\r\npleased Providence to postpone the attainment of this object. In the\r\nmidst of all the reflections called up by our misfortunes, while feeling\r\nkeenly sensitive to the loss, injury and wrong we have sustained, I\r\nfeel an exultant joy that you possess a mind similar to my own, that you\r\nare not disheartened, that you will persevere and endeavor at all\r\nhazards to attain the main object. I will devote all my time, all my\r\nthoughts, all my exertions, all the fortune I possess and all the money\r\nI can borrow, to compass and complete the business we have undertaken;\r\nand if fortune should by any future disaster deprive us of our reward,\r\nwe will at least have deserved it.\"\r\n\r\nWhile thus embarrassed information came from England that the cotton\r\ncleaned by their gins was ruined. Whitney nearly gave way under the\r\nstrain, and wrote to Mr. Miller at Dungeness: \"Our extreme\r\nembarrassments are now so great that it seems impossible to struggle\r\nlonger against them. It has required my utmost exertions to exist,\r\nwithout making any progress in our business. I have labored hard to stem\r\nthe strong current of disappointment which threatens to carry us over\r\nthe cataract, but have labored with a shattered oar, and in vain unless\r\nsome speedy help come. Life is short at best, and six or seven of its\r\nbest years are an immense sacrifice to him who makes it.\"\r\n\r\nReturning South, he constructed a new model (it is said at Dungeness),\r\nwith the object in view so to improve upon the old one as to remove the\r\nseed without injury to the staple. It was first tried in the presence of\r\nMrs. Greene and Mr. Miller, but found lacking in an important\r\nparticular. Mrs. Greene exclaimed, \"Why, Mr. Whitney, you want a brush,\"\r\nand with a stroke of her handkerchief removed the lint. Comprehending\r\nher idea at once, he replied, \"Mrs. Greene, you have completed the\r\ncotton-gin.\"\r\n\r\nWith the further fortunes of the brave inventor we have no more to do,\r\nas that part of his history intimately connected with Dungeness ends\r\nhere. His subsequent trials, disappointments, triumphs, all the world\r\nknows. His friend and partner, who so nobly sustained him, lies buried\r\nhere, so tradition says, having died in 1806 of lockjaw caused by\r\nrunning an orange-thorn through his hand while removing trees from\r\nFlorida to Dungeness.\r\n\r\nNear the tomb of Mrs. Miller is another: \"Sacred to pure affection.\r\nThis simple stone covers the remains of James Shaw. His virtues are not\r\nto be learned from perishable marble; but when the records of Heaven\r\nshall be unfolded it is believed they will be found written there in\r\ncharacters as durable as the volumes of eternity. Died January 6th,\r\n1820, aged 35 years.\" And by the side of this latter another marble\r\nslab, with this inscription, which explains itself: \"Louisa C. Shaw,\r\nrelict of James Shaw, Esq., and youngest daughter of Major-General\r\nNathaniel Greene of the Army of the Revolution. Died at Dungeness,\r\nGeorgia, April 24th, 1831, aged 45 years.\"\r\n\r\nThis ends the record of the residence of the family of General Greene at\r\nDungeness. That they made it their home for many years is evident--that\r\nthey removed here soon after the death of the general is probable. In\r\nthe division of General Greene's possessions Dungeness became the\r\nproperty of Mrs. Shaw, his youngest daughter: she, dying childless, left\r\nit to her nephew, Phineas Miller Nightingale. Mrs. Nightingale, wife of\r\nthe grandson of General Greene, to whom this property was given, was\r\ndaughter of Rufus King, governor of New York, and granddaughter of Rufus\r\nKing, minister to Great Britain during the elder Adams's administration.\r\nThe Nightingales, descendants of General Greene, remained in undisturbed\r\npossession until the late war, dispensing unbounded hospitality at their\r\nprincely mansion. During the war the house was occupied by Northern\r\ntroops until its close, when, through the negligence of some negro\r\nrefugees, it was burned. Its ruins alone testify to the wealth of former\r\nyears which now is departed, and the broad acreage of untilled fields\r\nand the ruined negro cabins cry out loudly for those who will never\r\nreturn to bless them.\r\n\r\nLet us turn once more to that cemetery in the olive-grove. Another stone\r\nclaims our attention, a tablet to the memory of him who pronounced those\r\nglowing words, \"First in war, first in peace, first in the hearts of his\r\ncountrymen:\" \"Sacred to the memory of Gen. Henry Lee of Virginia. Obiit\r\n25 March, 1818, aetat. 63.\" In 1814, General Lee was injured by a mob in\r\nBaltimore, and never recovered. Early in 1818 he arrived at Dungeness\r\nfrom Cuba, whither he had gone to regain his health. He landed from a\r\nschooner at the river landing, a weak, decrepit old man, in whom it\r\nwould have been difficult to recognize the dashing Light-Horse Harry of\r\nthe Revolution. A grandson of General Greene's, Phineas Miller\r\nNightingale, was loitering near the landing. Calling him, General Lee\r\nlearned who he was, and despatched him to his aunt, Mrs. Shaw, with the\r\nintelligence of his arrival. \"Tell her,\" said he, \"that the old friend\r\nand companion of General Greene has come to die in the arms of his\r\ndaughter.\"\r\n\r\nA carriage was sent for him, and he was installed in the southern\r\nchamber above the drawing-room, and everything done to alleviate his\r\npain that the kindest forethought could suggest. He lingered here some\r\ntwo months, and then passed away, and was buried in the family\r\nburying-ground. His only baggage at the time of his arrival was an old\r\nhair-covered trunk nailed round with brass-headed nails.\r\n\r\nAn anecdote is preserved in the family relating to the general's\r\nresidence there. One of the servants, Sara by name--commonly called \"the\r\nDuchess\" from her stately demeanor--incurred his ill-will. General Lee\r\nonce threatened to throw his boot at her, and the Duchess turned upon\r\nhim and replied, \"If you do I'll throw it back at you.\" This answer so\r\npleased the old general that he would afterward permit no other servant\r\nto wait upon him.\r\n\r\nSome years after his death a stone was placed above his grave by his\r\nson, General Robert E. Lee, who a few months prior to his death visited\r\nhis father's grave in company with his daughter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese are some of the associations that cluster about the ruins of\r\nDungeness, giving to those ivy-grown walls, to forest and shore, an\r\ninterest which mere attractions of scenery and climate could not awaken.\r\n\r\n  FREDERICK A. OBER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR MONTHLY GOSSIP.\r\n\r\n\"WESTERN MEMORABILIA.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the pioneers of the old-book trade in New York was William J.\r\nGowans, whose career as a dealer in old and rare books covered a period\r\nof nearly fifty years, and brought him into a contact more or less\r\nintimate with all the literary and many of the other notables of his\r\nday. Gowans had some literary aspirations, and in his old age projected\r\na book which he proposed to call _Western Memorabilia_, and which was to\r\nconsist of sketches and reminiscences of the famous men he had met in\r\nhis career. This book was never published--somewhat to the loss of\r\nAmerican literature, I am inclined to think after perusing some of its\r\nscattered fragments which have recently come into my possession. These\r\nare full of detail, and, as throwing light on the characters of some\r\npersons of whom far too little is known, are certainly worthy of\r\npreservation.\r\n\r\nOn Poe I find the following notes: \"The characters drawn of Poe by his\r\nvarious biographers and critics may with safety be pronounced an excess\r\nof exaggeration, but this is not to be much wondered at when it is\r\nconsidered that these men were his rivals, either as poets or\r\nprose-writers, and it is well known that such are generally as jealous\r\nof each other as are the ladies who are handsome of those who desire to\r\nbe considered so. It is an old truism, and as true as it is old, that in\r\nthe multitude of counsellors there is safety. I therefore will show you\r\nmy opinion of this gifted but unfortunate genius: it may be estimated as\r\nworth little, but it has this merit: it comes from an eye-and\r\near-witness, and this, it must be remembered, is the very highest of\r\nlegal evidence. For eight months or more, 'one house contained us, us\r\none table fed.' During that time I saw much of him, and had an\r\nopportunity of conversing with him often; and I must say I never saw him\r\nthe least affected with liquor, nor ever descend to any known vice,\r\nwhile he was one of the most courteous, gentlemanly and intelligent\r\ncompanions I have ever met. Besides, he had an extra inducement to be a\r\ngood man, for he had a wife of matchless beauty and loveliness: her eye\r\ncould match that of any houri, and her face defy the genius of a Canova\r\nto imitate; her temper and disposition were of surpassing sweetness; in\r\naddition, she seemed as much devoted to him and his every interest as a\r\nyoung mother is to her first-born. During this time he wrote his longest\r\nprose romance, entitled the _Adventures of Arthur Gordon Pym_. Poe had a\r\nremarkably pleasing and prepossessing countenance--what the ladies would\r\ncall decidedly handsome. He died after a brief and fitful career at\r\nBaltimore, October, 1849, where his remains lie interred in an obscure\r\nburying-ground.\"\r\n\r\nOf Simms he writes, under date of Oct. 15, 1868: \"To-day I had the\r\npleasure of a call from William Gilmore Simms, the novelist. He is quite\r\naffable in conversation, and apparently well stocked with general\r\ninformation, which he can impart with fluency. He appears somewhat\r\ndowncast, or rather, I should say, has a melancholy cast of countenance:\r\nhe is advanced in years, with a profusion of hair around his face, chin\r\nand throat--is apparently between sixty and seventy years of age. I\r\nrequested him to enroll his name in my autograph-book, which he did with\r\nreadiness. He remarked that he was often requested to do so, especially\r\nby the ladies. I replied that this was a debt which every man incurred\r\nwhen he became public property either by his words, actions or writings.\r\nHe acquiesced in the justice of the remark. Mr. Simms was in search of a\r\ncopy of Johnson's _History of the Seminoles_, to aid him in making a new\r\nbook. He was accompanied by Mr. Duykinck.\"\r\n\r\nHalleck is thus introduced: \"On a certain occasion I was passing a\r\nRoman Catholic church in New York: seeing the doors open and throngs of\r\npeople pressing in, I stepped inside to see what I could see. I had not\r\nwell got inside when I beheld Fitzgreene Halleck standing uncovered,\r\nwith reverential attitude, among the crowd of unshorn and unwashed\r\nworshippers. I remained till I saw him leave. In doing so he made a\r\ncourteous bow, as is the polite custom of the humblest of these people\r\non taking their departure.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of compliments paid him for poetical talents, Mr.\r\nHalleck once said to me, 'They are generally made by those who are\r\nignorant or who have a desire to please or flatter, or perhaps a\r\ncombination of all. As a general thing, they are devoid of sincerity,\r\nand rather offensive than pleasing. There is no general rule without its\r\nexception, however, and in my bagful of compliments I cherish one which\r\ncomes under that rule, and reflecting upon it affords me real pleasure\r\nas it did then. On a warm day in summer a young man came into the office\r\nwith a countenance glowing with ardor, innocence and honesty, and his\r\neyes beaming with enthusiasm. Said he, \"Is Mr. Halleck to be found\r\nhere?\" I answered in the affirmative. Continued he, with evidently\r\nincreased emotion, \"Could I see him?\"--\"You see him now,\" I replied. He\r\ngrasped me by the hand with a hearty vigorousness that added to my\r\nconviction of his sincerity. Said he, \"I am happy, most happy, in having\r\nhad the pleasure at last of seeing one whose poems have afforded me no\r\nordinary gratification and delight. I have longed to see you, and I have\r\ndreamt that I have seen you, but now I behold you with mine own eyes.\r\nGod bless you for ever and ever! I have come eleven hundred miles, from\r\nthe banks of the Miami in Ohio, mainly for that purpose, and I have been\r\ncompensated for my pains.\"'\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Halleck told me that he had been solicited to write a life of his\r\nearly and beloved friend Drake. 'But,' said he, 'I did not well see how\r\nI could grant such a request: I had no lever for my fulcrum. What could\r\nI say about one who had studied pharmacy, dissection, written a few\r\npoems, and then left the scene of action? I had no material, and a mere\r\nmeaningless eulogy would have been out of the question.'\r\n\r\n\"In personal appearance Halleck was rather below the medium height and\r\nwell built: in walking he had a rather slow and shuffling gait, as if\r\nsomething afflicted his feet; a florid, bland and pleasant countenance;\r\na bright gray eye; was remarkably pleasant and courteous in\r\nconversation, and, as a natural consequence, much beloved by all who had\r\nthe pleasure of his acquaintance. But to that brilliancy in conversation\r\nwhich some of his admirers have been pleased to attribute to him in my\r\nopinion he could lay no claim. His library was sold at auction in New\r\nYork on the evening of October 12, 1868. If the collection disposed of\r\non that occasion was really his library in full, it must be confessed it\r\nwas a sorry affair and meagre in the extreme. In surveying the\r\ncollection a judge of the value of such property would perhaps pronounce\r\nit worth from one hundred and twenty-five to one hundred and fifty\r\ndollars. The books brought fabulous prices--at least ten times their\r\nvalue. The company was large, good-humored and just in the frame of mind\r\nto be a little more than liberal, doubtless stimulated to be so from a\r\ndesire to possess a relic of the departed poet who had added fame to the\r\nliterature of his country. The following are the names of a few of the\r\nbooks and the prices they brought: _Nicholas Nickleby_, with the\r\nauthor's autograph, $18; Bryant's little volume of poems entitled\r\n_Thirty Poems_, with the author's autograph, $11; Campbell's _Poems_,\r\nwith Halleck's autograph, $8.50; _Catalogue of the Strawberry Hill\r\nCollection_, $16; _Barnaby Rudge_, presentation copy by the author to\r\nHalleck, $15; Coleridge's _Poems_, with a few notes by Halleck, $10;\r\n_Fanny_, a poem by Mr. Halleck, $10. The sum-total realized for his\r\nlibrary was twelve hundred and fifty dollars.\"\r\n\r\nAaron Burr is the subject of some interesting reminiscences: \"Shortly\r\nafter I came to New York, Aaron Burr was pointed out to me as he was\r\nslowly wending his way up Broadway, between Chambers street and the old\r\ntheatre, on the City Hall side. I frequently afterward met him in this\r\nand other streets. He was always an object of interest, inasmuch as he\r\nhad become an historical character, somewhat notoriously so. I will\r\nattempt to describe his appearance, or rather how he appeared to me: He\r\nwas small, thin and attenuated in form, perhaps a little over five feet\r\nin height, weight not much over a hundred pounds. He walked with a slow,\r\nmeasured and feeble step, stooping considerably, occasionally with both\r\nhands behind his back. He had a keen face and deep-set, dark eye, his\r\nhat set deep on his head, the back part sunk down to the collar of the\r\ncoat and the back brim somewhat turned upward. He was dressed in\r\nthreadbare black cloth, having the appearance of what is known as shabby\r\ngenteel. His countenance wore a melancholy aspect, and his whole\r\nappearance betokened one dejected, forsaken, forgotten or cast aside,\r\nand conscious of his position. He was invariably alone when I saw him,\r\nexcept on a single occasion: that was on the sidewalk in Broadway\r\nfronting what is now the Astor House, where he was standing talking very\r\nfamiliarly with a young woman whom he held by one hand. His countenance\r\non that occasion was cheerful, lighted up and bland--altogether\r\ndifferent from what it appeared to me when I saw him alone and in\r\nconversation with himself. Burr must have been a very exact man in his\r\nbusiness-affairs. His receipt-book came into my possession. I found\r\nthere receipts for a load of wood, a carpenter's work for one day, a\r\npair of boots, milk for a certain number of weeks, suit of clothes,\r\nbesides numerous other small transactions that but few would think of\r\ntaking a receipt for. The book was but a sorry, cheap affair, and could\r\nnot have cost when new more than fifty cents.\"\r\n\r\nEdwin Forrest is thus mentioned: \"At the time when Forrest was earning\r\nhis reputation on the boards of the Bowery Theatre I was connected with\r\nthat institution, and of course had an opportunity of seeing him every\r\nnight he performed. Mr. Forrest appeared to be possessed of the\r\nperfection of physical form, more especially conspicuous when arrayed in\r\nsome peculiar costumes which tended to display it to the best advantage.\r\nHe had a stentorian voice, and must have had lungs not less invulnerable\r\nthan one of Homer's heroes. He had a fine masculine face and\r\nprepossessing countenance, much resembling many of the notable Greeks\r\nand Romans whose portraits have come down to our time, and a keen\r\nintellectual eye. His countenance at times assumed an air of hauteur\r\nwhich doubtless had become a habit, either from personating characters\r\nof this stamp or from a consciousness of his merited popularity. He left\r\nthe impression on the beholder of one intoxicated with success and the\r\nrepletion of human applause. He kept aloof from all around him, and\r\ncondescended to no social intercourse with any one on the stage, and\r\nappeared to entertain a contempt for his audience.... He has now lost\r\nthat mercurial, youthful appearance which was then so conspicuous, and\r\nwhich doubtless aided in laying the foundation of his widespread\r\nreputation. He was then straight as an arrow and elastic as a\r\ncircus-rider, the very beau-ideal of physical perfection: now he bears\r\nthe marks of decay, or rather, as is said of grain just before harvest,\r\nhe has a ripe appearance. If he would consult his renown he would retire\r\nfrom the stage, and never set foot upon it again.\"\r\n\r\nThe fragments also contain notes on Bryant, Parton, Mrs. Siddons and\r\nseveral eminent divines and journalists. Of the latter class the fullest\r\nrelate to James Gordon Bennett, founder of the _Herald_, and his\r\ncoadjutor, William H. Attree. The following are extracts: \"I remember\r\nentering the subterranean office of Mr. Bennett early in the career of\r\nthe _Herald_ and purchasing a single copy of the paper, for which I paid\r\nthe sum of one cent only. On this occasion the proprietor, editor and\r\nvender was seated at his desk busily engaged in writing, and appeared to\r\npay little or no attention to me as I entered. On making known my object\r\nin coming in, he requested me to put my money down on the counter and\r\nhelp myself to a paper: all this time he continued his writing\r\noperations. The office was a single oblong, underground room. Its\r\nfurniture consisted of a counter, which also served as a desk,\r\nconstructed from two flour-barrels, perhaps empty, standing apart from\r\neach other about four feet, with a single plank covering both; a chair,\r\nplaced in the centre, upon which sat the editor busy at his vocation,\r\nwith an inkstand by his right hand; on the end nearest the door were\r\nplaced the papers for sale. I attribute the success of the _Herald_ to a\r\ncombination of circumstances--to the peculiar fitness of its editor for\r\nhis position, to its cheapness, and its advertising patronage, which was\r\nconsiderable. In the fourth place, it early secured the assistance of\r\nWilliam H. Attree, a man of uncommon abilities as a reporter and a\r\nconcocter of pithy as well as ludicrous chapters greatly calculated to\r\ncaptivate many readers. In fact, this clever and talented assistant in\r\nsome respects never had his match. He did not, as other reporters do,\r\ntake down in short-hand what the speaker or reader said, but sat and\r\nheard the passing discourse like any other casual spectator: when over\r\nhe would go home to his room, write out in full all that had been said\r\non the occasion, and that entirely from memory. On a certain occasion I\r\nhinted to him my incredulity about his ability to report as he had\r\nfrequently informed me. To put the matter beyond doubt, he requested me\r\nto accompany him to Clinton Hall to hear some literary magnate let off\r\nhis intellectual steam. I accordingly accompanied him as per\r\narrangement. We were seated together in the same pew. He placed his\r\nhands in his pockets and continued in that position during the delivery\r\nof the discourse, and when it was finished he remarked to me that I\r\nwould not only find the substance of this harangue in the _Herald_ the\r\nnext day, but that I would find it word for word. On the following\r\nmorning I procured the paper, and read the report of what I had heard\r\nthe previous evening; and I must say I was struck with astonishment at\r\nits perfect accuracy. Before Mr. Attree's time reporting for the press\r\nin New York was a mere outline or sketch of what had been said or done,\r\nbut he infused life and soul into this department of journalism. His\r\nreports were full, accurate, graphic; and, what is more, he frequently\r\nflattered the vanity of the speaker by making a much better speech for\r\nhim than he possibly could for himself. Poor Attree died in 1849, and is\r\nentombed at Greenwood.\"\r\n\r\nIt is probable that other fragments of this work are in existence, and\r\nif so it is hoped that the publication of these will tend to their\r\ndiscovery.\r\n\r\n  C.B.T.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCERNING NIGHT-NOISES.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany a time these summer nights am I startled out of my midnight sleep\r\nby a conversation like the following as two friends pause on the corner\r\nbeneath my suburban window:\r\n\r\n\"Well, good-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Good_-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold on a moment. I want to--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes. Rely on me. Do you think he will--\"\r\n\r\n\"He promised.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, then he'll do it. Well, then, good--\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-night, good-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait an instant. But how shall I--\"\r\n\r\n\"... Now you understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes. Good-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Good_-night.\"\r\n\r\nAfter these exclamations, uttered with piercing distinctness, have been\r\nexchanged, the belated revellers from some club or whist-party or an\r\nevening at the theatre in town terminate their sweet sorrow at parting\r\nby going their several ways to their different homes, where, no doubt,\r\non retiring to rest they sink at once into blameless slumber, ignorant\r\nof the fact that for me they have murdered sleep.\r\n\r\nI had gone to bed betimes, wornout with hard mental labor: I had hoped\r\nfor a night's repose to recruit my energies for the morrow. This sleep I\r\ncraved was no luxurious indulgence of pampered inclination, but my stock\r\nin trade--my bone, my sinew, my heart's courage, my mental inspiration,\r\nthe immediate jewel of my soul.\r\n\r\n    Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing:\r\n    'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands;\r\n    But he that filches from me my NIGHT'S SLEEP\r\n    Robs me of that which not enriches him,\r\n    And makes me poor indeed.\r\n\r\nBut let me now repose again: tenderly entreated, softly courted, sleep\r\nmay return. There are many specifics for bringing slumber to mutinous\r\neyelids. Let me remember what they are.\r\n\r\n_First._ To think of the wind blowing on a field of grain. Watch with\r\nyour mind's eye the long wavy undulations, the golden sheen which takes\r\nthe light. What a dreamy, exquisite rhythm! (Still, I don't sleep.)\r\n\r\n_Second._ Repeat the multiplication-table backward, from twelve times\r\ndown to twice. (Hopeless, the only result being to render my\r\nmathematical powers acutely, preternaturally awake, so that I begin to\r\nestimate the magnitude of my summer expenses.)\r\n\r\n_Third._ Try to decide where to spend the August vacation. I am thinking\r\nof Lake George, the Saguenay, Sea Girt, the White Mountains, when all at\r\nonce I begin to yield drowsily to the influence of long conversations\r\nabout nothing which take possession of my mind--mere gibberish, strings\r\nof words without sense. Thank Heaven, I am off! I am actually going to\r\nsleep. _Not yet!_\r\n\r\nDown the street comes a man with an accordion. He is playing \"Annie\r\nLaurie.\" Every now and then he strikes a wrong note. Excruciating agony!\r\nDid he render it correctly it might blend with a romantic dream, but\r\nwhen he insists on flatting persistently, as for bonnie Annie Laurie he\r\noffers to lay him down and die, who is to bear it? And why does he not\r\nconsummate the proffered sacrifice by dying at once? I would cheerfully\r\nbury him. He passes slowly, lingeringly, seeming to pause outside of my\r\nwindow, as if my casement enshrined that form like the snowdrift and\r\nthat throat like the swan's. But, although he vanishes finally, the\r\nstreet has become alive. Two men pass in deeply-interesting\r\nconversation, one of them assuring the other that he has not done \"a\r\nstroke's work\" in two years. He is maudlin, of course. \"A stroke's\r\nwork\"? And as if any man could expect to find work and to do it after\r\nkeeping such hours as these!\r\n\r\nAnd now comes \"the whistler.\" I had been expecting him. He is to-night\r\nwhistling airs from _Pinafore_. The _Pirates_, thank Heaven! furnishes\r\nhim no airs. He whistles--let me confess, reluctant although I am to do\r\nit--he whistles to perfection. There is nothing experimental, nothing\r\ntentative, in his notes, which come clear, sharp, in perfect time and\r\ntune.\r\n\r\nThe clock strikes two. It is the voice of doom, for presently the 2.19\r\nfreight-train will thunder slowly through our end of the town. It\r\nrenders my case utterly hopeless. One might as well expect to sleep in\r\nmomentary expectation of the Juggernaut. I know its every sound: I can\r\nfeel the bridge at ---- Junction, five miles away, tremble under it. I\r\nlisten and wait, every nerve on edge. A mile and a half the other side\r\nof our station the engine will first snort, then begin a series of\r\nshrieks--shrieks suggestive of warning, imminent danger, supreme peril,\r\nthe climax of a tragical catastrophe. For at least five minutes shall I\r\nbe compelled to listen while the engineer--if it be a real living\r\nengine-man who impels this chorus of fiends--runs the full scale of his\r\nshrill tooting, perhaps deeming it essential to the safety of the town,\r\nwhich ought to be asleep, or to the dignity of his long, creeping train\r\nof coal- and freight-laden cars.\r\n\r\nEven the Juggernaut passes: it is gone. I emerge, faint and wornout from\r\nthe trial. Now that it is toward three o'clock, everybody except the\r\npoliceman in bed, and no more trains to come until after five, one might\r\nsuppose there was some chance for an interval of peace, of repose. I get\r\nup and walk about a little in order to feel, with the opportunity, the\r\ninclination for slumber. Yes, it will come....\r\n\r\nScarcely have I ventured to close my eyes again before there begins a\r\nchirp, a twitter, a general thrill of sound. All the birds are awake,\r\nand are soon in full chorus. Presently a flush of color will run around\r\nthe horizon, and it will be dawn. The actual night has flown. I can\r\nhear Smith, our grocery-man around the corner, setting off into the\r\ncountry for his milk and eggs. Several marketcarts are abroad.... There\r\ngoes an extra train, shrieking direly along the curve.\r\n\r\nIt is actually growing light. With the first gleam of day my excellent\r\naunt--who embodies all my future expectations of wealth--sleeping in the\r\nnext chamber, turns in her bed, yawns loudly and unreservedly, gets up\r\nand takes an observation, opening and closing her shutters with a bang.\r\nBy breakfast-time my revered relation becomes a respectable and no\r\nlonger a riotous member of society, but during the early morning hours\r\nher inventions for disturbing her neighbors are ingenious and\r\ndiabolical.\r\n\r\nBy five o'clock the morning-trains begin, followed at half-past six by\r\nfifty factory-whistles. The children are awake and stirring. The\r\nhousemaid is banging her utensils on piazza and in hallway: the cook is\r\nflirting with the milk-and butter-man at the back gate, and exclaiming\r\n\"Oh Laws!\" to some news or pleasantry of his. The licensed venders are\r\nabroad. There are all sorts of cries. It is less than an hour to\r\nbreakfast. The night is lost: one foolish, intolerable noise has spoiled\r\nall.\r\n\r\n  L.W.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABARIN, THE FRENCH MERRY-ANDREW.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe French word _tabarin_ is almost obsolete, and its English synonym,\r\n_merry-andrew_, is not much in vogue, but as they are andronymics, to\r\ncoin a word, embalming the memories of two famous charlatans, they\r\npossess an abiding interest apart from all question of their use or\r\ndisuse.\r\n\r\nAndrew Borde and Tabarin were both charlatans and both famous, but here\r\nall resemblance between them ceases. The former was a witty and\r\neccentric quack, who travelled about from place to place and country to\r\ncountry selling drugs and practising medicine in fairs and marketplaces,\r\nwhere his glib tongue readily gathered crowds and earned him the\r\nnickname which has since passed current in English as a generic term for\r\nbuffoons of all sorts and conditions. The tenth volume of the _Extra\r\nSeries_ of the Early English Text Society is wholly devoted to Borde,\r\nand well repays perusal, although probably few who read it will agree\r\nwith Mr. Furnivall, the editor, that \"any one who would make him more of\r\na merry-andrew than anything else is a bigger fool than he would make\r\nBorde.\"\r\n\r\nTabarin, however, was a veritable and inimitable clown, and his name has\r\nfigured in French literature both as a proper and a common noun almost\r\nfrom the day that he and his partner, Mondor, set up their booth on the\r\nPont Neuf. They began their sale of ointments and liniments in Paris\r\nabout the year 1618, attracting custom by their absurd dialogues in the\r\nvein of the circus-clown and ring-master of to-day. Occasionally they\r\nleft the city to try their luck in the provinces, but during most of\r\ntheir career they were to be found on the bridge near the entrance to\r\nthe Place Dauphine. Tabarin retired from the business about 1630, but\r\nhis partner continued at the old stand with a new clown, who must have\r\nbeen either less witty or more obscene than Tabarin, for in 1634 Mondor\r\nwas abated as a nuisance by the authorities.\r\n\r\nTabarin was blessed with a wife and daughter: his wife's name was\r\nFrancisquine; his daughter married the celebrated buffoon Gaultier\r\nGarguille. The story goes that when he left Mondor he bought a small\r\ncountry-place near Paris, where he passed his latter days comfortably on\r\nhis earnings. There are two traditions current as to the manner of his\r\ndeath: according to one, he was killed by some noblemen in a hunting\r\nquarrel; according to the other, he died from the effects of heavy\r\ndrinking for a wager. He is said to have styled himself Tabarin because\r\nhe usually appeared in a little tabard, called in Italian _tabarrino_,\r\nbut his true name and his nationality are alike unknown.\r\n\r\nTabarin's pleasantries, as jotted down by members of his audiences, have\r\nbeen given to the world at divers times in various forms, and have\r\nlatterly been collected and published in a body with those of his less\r\nsuccessful rival Grattelard; but very few of them are suited to\r\nnineteenth-century taste, and most of them are gross to the last degree.\r\nSome of the presentable ones are here given, and may serve as specimens\r\nof his manner, though they will scarcely account for his reputation:\r\n\r\n_Tab._ Who are the politest people in the world, master?\r\n\r\n_Mon._ I've travelled in Spain, Italy and Germany, and I assure you that\r\nthe French nation is by all odds the most courteous. They are the only\r\npeople in the world that kiss and compliment, and above all take off\r\nhats.\r\n\r\n_Tab._ Take off hats! If that's courtesy I don't want any of it.\r\n\r\n_Mon._ Taking off hats, Tabarin, is an ancient custom originating among\r\nthe Romans. It is done in token of good-will.\r\n\r\n_Tab._ So you say taking off hats is the pink of politeness? Now, if\r\nthat's so, do you want to know who I think are the politest people?\r\n\r\n_Mon._ Yes: who?\r\n\r\n_Tab._ Why, our Paris street-thieves, for they don't stop at taking off\r\nhats, but take cloaks off too.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Tab._ Master, why don't they let women take orders?\r\n\r\n_Mon._ Because the sex is frail, Tabarin, and not worthy to conduct the\r\nservices of the Church, which are sacred mysteries.\r\n\r\n_Tab._ Humbug! It's because they always will have the last word, so it\r\nwouldn't do to let them give the responses. Why, the services would\r\nnever end.\r\n\r\nBy similar logic Tabarin demonstrates, among others, the following\r\npropositions:\r\n\r\nAn ass is a better linguist than his master, because he understands when\r\nhe is spoken to, while his lingo is all lost upon the man.\r\n\r\nA fiddler has the hardest lot of all mankind, because his life depends\r\nupon a bit of wood and a piece of cord, for all the world like a\r\nmalefactor's.\r\n\r\nCut-purses are the most liberal of all men, for they not only empty\r\ntheir own purses, but those of other people.\r\n\r\nIf you put a miller, a tailor, a bailiff and an attorney in a bag, the\r\nfirst thing to come out will be a thief.\r\n\r\nThe most wonderful gardener and the most wonderful tree in the world\r\nare respectively Jack Ketch and the gallows tree, because when the\r\nhangman plants that unpleasant vegetable it bears fruit the same day.\r\n\r\nIf you see six birds on a tree, and shoot three, there will be _none_\r\nleft, for of course the remaining three will fly away. This last jest is\r\nso trite to-day as to be absolutely threadbare.\r\n\r\nTabarin's wits were not exhausted by this kind of buffoonery. He issued\r\ncomic proclamations and almanacs, and even produced short farces in\r\nwhich his wife performed with him. From one of these farces Moliere is\r\nsupposed to have borrowed the ideas for his sack-scene in the\r\n_Fourberies de Scapin_.\r\n\r\nLa Fontaine stole one of Grattelard's dialogues bodily, and converted it\r\ninto the celebrated fable of _The Acorn and the Pumpkin_. Grattelard was\r\ncontemporary with Tabarin, as remarked above: he and his partner,\r\nDesiderio Descombes, sold quack medicines at the north end of the Pont\r\nNeuf. The dialogue in question follows, at least so much of it as is in\r\npoint, and will serve as tailpiece to the specimens of Tabarin's wit:\r\n\r\n_Grat._ I had a great discussion this morning with a philosopher, trying\r\nto prove to him that Nature often makes great mistakes.\r\n\r\n_D. D._ No, no, Grattelard: everything that Nature does is done for the\r\nbest.\r\n\r\n_Grat._ Just wait now: let me tell you how I had to give in.\r\n\r\n_D. D._ Well, how was it?\r\n\r\n_Grat._ We were walking in the garden, and pretty soon we came across a\r\ntremendous pumpkin, as big as a Swiss drum. \"There!\" said I: \"Nature has\r\nno better sense than to hang a great thing like that on such a slender\r\nvine that the least breeze can break it off.\"\r\n\r\n_D. D._ Then you blamed Nature in the matter of the pumpkin?\r\n\r\n_Grat._ Yes, for of course there ought to be some proportion _inter\r\nsustinens et sustentum_; but, by Heavens, I soon changed my mind, for\r\njust as I was passing under a great oak tree down fell an acorn and\r\nstruck me on the nose. Of course I had to admit that Nature was right,\r\nafter all, for if she had put a pumpkin up there I should have been in a\r\npretty pickle.\r\n\r\n_D. D._ Yes indeed, Grattelard: you would have cut a fine figure\r\ndrinking out of a bottle with your nose in a sling.\r\n\r\n_Grat._ By the Georgics of Virgil, 'twould be all up with spectacles for\r\nmy old age.\r\n\r\nTabarin was the first of the series of clowns that enlivened the streets\r\nof Paris for two hundred years, or, at any rate, the first to attain\r\ncelebrity: Bobeche in our own century was the last. He made a great\r\nnoise in his day, but nothing keeps his memory green except the Bobeche\r\nof Offenbach's _Barbe-Bleue_. Tabarin, however, has a new lease of life\r\nin two of the handy little-volumes of the _Bibliotheque Elzevirienne_.\r\n\r\n  S.E.T.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA LEGION OF DEVILS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Everybody knows,\" said Beppo, my Roman model, \"that the English are\r\nmad, signor. For has not the padre told me so? and does he not say that\r\nthe fires of Purgatory burn within them? Else why do they roll about in\r\na tub of water every morning, if not to cool their vitals? It is an\r\ninsult to an Italian to wash him: we only wash dead bodies;\" and Beppo\r\ndraws his huge frame up to its full height, while his black eyes flash,\r\nand I mentally acknowledge him and his begrimed rags picturesque if\r\nfilthy.\r\n\r\n\"Si, si, they are all mad,\" he continues, \"and they keep horses and dogs\r\nas mad as themselves; and they ride out, dressed in the very color of\r\nthe flames of Purgatory, to run screaming and shouting after poor foxes\r\nover the Campagna, notwithstanding the Holy Father has rigorously\r\nprohibited that sort of insanity, and has placed his gendarmerie\r\npurposely to stop it. But who can stop _il diavolo e gli suoi angeli_?\r\nWhy, signor, if they want foxes, I myself, Beppo Donati, would catch\r\nthem any number for a paul or two. But they are all mad, all mad. And\r\nthe dogs, it is well known how they became possessed; for,\" lowering his\r\nvoice and coming nearer me, \"I myself saw the arch-fiend himself and his\r\nlegions enter them bodily. I will tell the signor how it was.\r\n\r\n\"The signor has been in the Catacombs of the blessed martyrs, but\r\ncannot know as much about them as myself, who was custodian for many a\r\nyear in the dangerous and least frequented ones; and it was there that I\r\nreceived the hurt that caused me to turn model. Many are the hours I\r\nhave passed in the remote ones lying miles away from the Eternal City,\r\nwhere the only available entrance was a tortuous, chimney-like hole\r\nalmost filled with rubbish, and so insignificant in appearance that it\r\nhad remained concealed by a few bushes from the time it was last used by\r\nthe blessed martyrs themselves till to-day.\r\n\r\n\"To descend this aperture, signor, one struggles along with much\r\ndifficulty: lying on one's chest, and with a lighted taper in one hand,\r\nthe other holding a rope that has been made fast to a tree outside, one\r\nslides down by degrees feet foremost. The passages are usually narrowed\r\nand choked by the rubbish, and descend nearly perpendicularly to where,\r\nlower down, they open wider and your feet touch steps cut roughly in the\r\nrock; but you must not trust them, for the soft stone will crumble with\r\nyour weight. After descending some sixty or seventy feet you suddenly\r\nbump against an old stone doorway, and you are at the bottom. But on\r\npassing the doorway your position is even worse, as the stagnant pools\r\nof muddy water reach up to your knees, and the passages are too low to\r\nadmit of your standing upright, while you stretch your taper into a\r\nthick darkness that closes over everything a few yards distant and\r\nprevents your seeing anything but the horizontal niches in tiers, one\r\nabove the other, where the mortal remains of the beatific lie surrounded\r\nby the symbols of the faith they died for. Here they keep their vigil\r\ncentury after century over our Holy City, while they await their\r\nglorious resurrection.\r\n\r\n\"I have been miles under the Campagna in these subterranean cemeteries.\r\nNo one has yet ascertained their entire extent. They branch out in every\r\ndirection, and the ramifications are so countless--not only on a level,\r\nbut in stories underlying one another--and so many of them have fallen\r\nin or been filled with water, that no successful attempt has ever been\r\nmade to follow them to their extremities. Nor can it be found out\r\nwhether they communicate with one another or remain as they were\r\noriginally, distinct from each other.\r\n\r\n\"You have heard, signor, that the early Christians celebrated the feasts\r\nof the Church by visiting the then newly-decorated and consecrated\r\nsubterranean cemeteries, and that on one of these occasions, when a\r\nlarge crowd of persons had entered to celebrate a festival, it occurred\r\nto the ruling authorities that the opportunity might be advantageously\r\nused to lessen by so many the troublesome and ever-increasing population\r\nof the new faith. Accordingly, a number of huge stones were brought and\r\nthe entrance built up and rigidly guarded till all the unfortunate\r\nprisoners had died a martyr's death.\r\n\r\n\"After that, to guard against a repetition of such an act, various\r\napertures of exit were made, and may now be frequently found on the\r\nCampagna, where, when one's foot sinks into a doubtful-looking hole\r\nfilled with rubbish, one knows it penetrates to the depths beneath.\r\nSecret passages were also made to debouch in the private houses of\r\nwell-known Christians or buildings set apart for Christian worship; and\r\nit was from one of these walled-up doorways that I, Beppo Donati, myself\r\nsaw _un miracolo_ performed and a legion of devils let loose.\r\n\r\n\"It was in the church of St. Prassede. St. Prassede, the signor knows,\r\nwas one of the daughters of the senator Pudens mentioned by St. Paul as\r\nsending his greetings to Timothy. The present church stands on the site\r\nof the very house once inhabited by this Christian family, and in the\r\ndark crypt under the high altar there is a walled-up doorway with the\r\nsign of the cross upon it. The crypt was originally the cellar of the\r\nancient house, into which debouched one of the secret entrances to the\r\nCatacombs: at one extremity of the crypt is the doorway in question, now\r\nstrongly built up, with the cross impressed in its superficial stucco.\r\n\r\n\"For many centuries the subterranean excavations behind the crypt have\r\nbeen haunted by the Evil One and his coadjutors, who break forth from\r\ntime to time in unearthly noises, racings, scamperings, moanings and\r\nyellings, and scarcely a man, woman or child in the vicinity but has\r\nheard them with their own veritable ears. Many special services of\r\nexorcism have been performed in the church above to meet the occasions\r\nas they might arise, but with no permanent effect. And, signor,\r\nnotwithstanding the cloud of witnesses that can testify to these\r\nsupernatural sounds, the city contains sceptics, and none more\r\ndetermined than the learned Father Xavier of the Holy Propaganda.\r\n\r\n\"The day of the miracle that I am about to tell you of was a dark, wet\r\nThursday in November, when my wife Teresina and myself attended high\r\nmass at St. Prassede, in honor of Teresina's festa. At the conclusion of\r\nthe mass strange sounds were heard behind the walls of the crypt, and\r\nmore especially at the back of the walled-up door. Gasps, yellings,\r\nscamperings, and then a cessation, and again a repetition of the same\r\nunearthly sounds with increased vehemence. Sometimes they would seem to\r\nrecede till they died away in the distance, and then come rushing as if\r\na whole legion of the enemy were close at hand. From the body of the\r\nchurch the crypt is approached by an open passage down a wide flight of\r\nsteps immediately in front of the high altar, and the walled door, as\r\nwell as the whole of the crypt, can be distinctly seen from the top of\r\nthe steps. When the mysterious noises were first heard most of the\r\ncongregation had retreated precipitately to the doors, but some of the\r\nmore pious or venturesome--among whom were Teresina and myself--had\r\nremained, and were leaning over the balusters while the padre descended\r\nwith his attendants to perform the special service appointed for the\r\noccasion. The exorcism took effect, for the noises, from being very\r\nuproarious, suddenly ceased altogether, and the arch-fiend seemed\r\npacified, if not utterly routed, until at the close of the service, a\r\nbell was rung as appointed in the office. The sound of this bell had the\r\neffect of increasing the demoniac uproar to such a degree that the\r\npadre officiating was fain to hurry through the rest of the service as\r\nbest he could and beat a precipitate retreat, with the acolytes, bells\r\nand all, to the sacristy.\r\n\r\n\"Teresina and myself had fled to the door of the church, where we\r\nstationed ourselves in a convenient place for a start when the occasion\r\nmight require it. We had not been there long when we saw Father\r\nXavier--the sceptic I told the signor about--enter the church with two\r\nassistants armed with crowbars and pickaxes, and proceed immediately to\r\nthe crypt, where no doubt could exist as to the noises at that moment,\r\nas the yellings, scamperings and scramblings were loud enough in all\r\nconscience. The sacristan came out from the body of the church and\r\nsuggested another exorcism to the reverend father, who answered that he\r\npreferred the pickaxe, and, turning to beckon to his workmen, found they\r\nhad fled. Nowise daunted, the reverend gentleman took off his coat,\r\nrolled up his sleeves and went to work with a will, making the vault\r\nre-echo with his blows. This operation, while it had the effect of\r\nthinning the audience still further in the church, where Teresina and I\r\nlingered, certainly abated the noises behind the door, until the padre's\r\nblows, continuing with unabated energy, effected a breach where the very\r\nhead and claws of the Evil One himself were actually to be seen\r\nprotruding through the aperture: in one moment more the whole troop of\r\nthe enemy had dashed through the opening, upset the padre, and were in\r\nfull career through the church, from whence the whole assembly took\r\nflight into the streets, uttering frantic shouts and seeking safety in\r\nthe houses. The legionaries of Satan had it all to themselves, and\r\ncontinued their career until they arrived at the place where the English\r\nkeep their hounds, where, with a tremendous yell, they leaped over the\r\ngate and disappeared in the kennels.\r\n\r\n\"I myself saw this, signor,\" said Beppo, giving his head an emphatic\r\nnod, \"and have I not every reason for saying that the hounds, as well\r\nas their masters, are possessed?\"\r\n\r\nBeppo's story still leaving some physiological questions unsolved in my\r\ndark Protestant mind, I took occasion to speak to Father Xavier himself\r\nabout it when I next met him. From him I learned that on the morning in\r\nquestion a party of English left the city on a hunting-excursion on the\r\nCampagna. A fox was unearthed after considerable delay, and a sharp run\r\nstarted, when suddenly fox, dogs and all disappeared down one of the\r\nnumerous holes leading to the Catacombs. As the occurrence was not\r\nunusual, the hunt waited, expecting them to reappear up some other\r\naperture; but after lingering the greater part of the day they were\r\nobliged to return to the city without the dogs, who had found their way\r\nthrough the dark and intricate passages to the door of the crypt, where\r\nthe sceptical padre, as we have seen, liberated them.\r\n\r\n  M.S.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEMIDOFFS.\r\n\r\n\r\nReaders of the agreeable memoirs of Madame Le Brun may remember the\r\npassage in which she speaks of a certain \"M. Demidoff, le plus riche\r\nparticulier de la Russie.\" His father, she goes on to say, had left him\r\nan inheritance of great value in the shape of mines, the products of\r\nwhich he sold to the government on very profitable terms. His enormous\r\nwealth enabled him to obtain the hand of a Miss Strogonov, the daughter\r\nof one of the most ancient families of the land. Their union was an\r\nharmonious one, and they left two sons, \"of whom one,\" concludes our\r\nauthor, \"lives most of the time at Paris, and, like his father, is very\r\nfond of art.\"\r\n\r\nMadame Le Brun's friend was Nicolai Demidoff (1774-1828), one of the\r\nleast distinguished members of his family, who have been the\r\nmining-kings of Russia for two centuries. The contemporary of Peter the\r\nGreat was ennobled by him (without receiving a title), and in the patent\r\nit was decreed that the family should be for ever free from military and\r\nother service, \"that they may devote themselves to the discovery of\r\nmetals.\" Nicolai's son Anatoli was born in Moscow March 24, 1813: he\r\nwas sent to Paris to be educated, and remained there till his eighteenth\r\nyear, studying at various institutions, including the law-school and the\r\nEcole Polytechniqne. Shortly after his return his father died, and he\r\ncame into possession of an enormous property, which he immediately began\r\nto spend, lavishly, but generously. In St. Petersburg he bought and\r\nfurnished a large building to serve as a charitable institution. From\r\nits kitchen two hundred thousand meals are given yearly to the poor, and\r\nin it one hundred and fifty orphans are housed and fed, one hundred and\r\nfifty girls are trained to be capable servants, and forty impoverished\r\ngentlewomen find a home. When the cholera raged in the same city not\r\nlong afterward he not only established a hospital, but is said to have\r\ndevoted himself personally to the care of the sick. In the furtherance\r\nof science and art he was still more munificent. He founded the Demidoff\r\nprizes, which annually distribute nearly four thousand dollars to the\r\nauthors of the most useful works published during the year, while from\r\nhis mines in Siberia eight young men went forth yearly to acquire a\r\nthorough technical education at his expense. In 1837, urged by the great\r\nneed of coal felt by the Russian industrial classes, he began a three\r\nyears' exploration of the Black Sea country, accompanied by a staff of\r\nsix professors, who produced a detailed report, not only of the\r\ncoal-deposits, but also of the zoology, botany and geology of the region\r\ntraversed. The results of their labors are described in four octavo\r\nvolumes--_Voyage dans la Russie meridionale, executee sous la direction\r\nde M. Anatole de Demidoff_--and inscribed to the emperor Nicholas. One\r\nreward of this labor was election to the Institute de France, his\r\ncompetitors being Parry and Sir John Franklin.\r\n\r\nSome years before this time he had entered the diplomatic service, being\r\nattache, first, at Vienna, then at Rome, then charge d'affaires at\r\nFlorence. Here he met and married Mathilde Bonaparte, who, through her\r\nmother, was closely connected with his sovereign. Nicolai's daughter had\r\nbeen allowed to make a love-match in marrying the duke of Leuchtenberg,\r\nson of Eugene Beauharnais, and the emperor was by no means pleased to\r\nhave another mesalliance in the family. What most offended him, however,\r\nwas the fact that M. Demidoff, in the Catholic as well as in the Greek\r\nmarriage ceremony, had promised to educate his children in the faith of\r\nthe officiating priest. In consequence of this he was deprived of such\r\ntitular honors as he possessed and was ordered to live abroad. As the\r\nmarried pair did not get on very well, and as, after a childless union\r\nof four years, they agreed to separate, Demidoff was again received into\r\nthe imperial favor. He had meantime bought the fine estate and mansion\r\nof San Donato, near Florence; and as he thought the possessor of so much\r\nwealth and the husband of so noble a lady deserved to have a title, he\r\ndubbed himself \"prince,\" and continued to enjoy this self-given title,\r\nprobably in the hope that an uncontested use would give him a\r\nprescriptive right to bear it. In this hope he was disappointed, for\r\nCount Medem, an attache of the Russian embassy at Paris, noticing\r\n\"Prince Demidoff\" on the list of the members of the Jockey Club, crossed\r\nthe name out, adding the observation, \"Il n'y a pas de prince Demidoff.\"\r\nA bloodless duel followed.\r\n\r\nIn the lately-published memoirs of the German novelist Hacklaender--who\r\nin 1843 figured as secretary to the crown-prince of Wuertemberg during\r\nhis visit to Italy--we have an agreeable picture of M. Demidoff at San\r\nDonato. \"His paintings, sculptures, odd furniture, bronzes and weapons\r\nwere arranged in an irregular and apparently arbitrary fashion, so that\r\nthey did not produce the wearisome effect of an ordinary collection, but\r\nlooked rather like treasures with which their owner had surrounded\r\nhimself partly for use, partly only to look at.\" Demidoff \"was a tall,\r\nthin man,\" continues Mr. Hacklaender, \"with light, almost yellow,\r\ncomplexion, and always dressed with extreme elegance. On the occasion of\r\nour first visit to his town-house the princess was painting in her\r\nstudio, in which art she was more than a dilettante. The prince went\r\nfirst to her with Demidoff, and after they had come back we heard from\r\nher a peal of the heartiest laughter, which rung down through five large\r\nrooms. Soon after she came out and greeted us in the kindest fashion.\r\nShe was then a young and handsome woman, with a splendid figure,\r\ngraceful curves, fine eyes and complexion,--all beautified and illumined\r\nby her pleasant voice and happy manner.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1851, Demidoff bought the villa of San Martini, which Bonaparte\r\noccupied during his stay in Elba, improved the building at a cost of\r\nforty thousand dollars, and made of it a museum in which were to be seen\r\nall sorts of curiosities connected with the great emperor--hats,\r\nswords, pistols, portraits of the king of Rome, and manuscripts for\r\nwhich he paid one hundred thousand dollars. His uncle's other\r\ncollections the present M. (or, if you like, Prince) Demidoff sold at\r\nauction the present year: I have not heard whether the Elba relics were\r\nsold with them.\r\n\r\nFlorence, as well as St. Petersburg, owes much to M. Demidoff--among\r\nother things, an asylum in which fifty boys are trained in silk-weaving.\r\nIt was in Paris, however, not in the city which he so long honored with\r\nhis residence, that in 1870 this philanthropic and enterprising man took\r\nleave of worldly vanities.\r\n\r\n  A.V.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERATURE OF THE DAY.\r\n\r\n     A History of Classical Greek Literature. By the Rev. J.P. Mahaffy,\r\n     M.A., Fellow and Professor of Ancient History, Trinity College,\r\n     Dublin. New York: Harper & Brothers.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is easy to imagine a history of Greek literature which should be not\r\nonly useful and stimulative to the student, but fascinating to the\r\ngeneral mass of intelligent readers. The literature of Greece is not,\r\nlike that of modern nations, the mirror of a many-colored life; but the\r\noriginality, variety and perfection of its forms make it on the whole\r\nthe most complete and splendid representation of thought and imagination\r\nwhich the world possesses. While it owed little or nothing to any\r\nforeign influence, it was itself the source of all later conceptions of\r\nliterary art, and though it exists only in fragmentary remains, these\r\nstill furnish the chief standard of excellence in nearly every\r\ndepartment. The subject is therefore unique both in the value of its\r\nmaterials and in the definiteness of its limits. What is demanded for\r\nthe adequate treatment of it is not universal knowledge, but minute and\r\nthorough scholarship; not a wide and diversified experience, an\r\nunlimited range of sympathies, the power of detecting subtle motives and\r\ndisentangling complicated threads of action, but a comprehension of the\r\nsimple and eternal elements of character and conduct, the faculty of\r\ntracing a specific development from its origin to its decline, while\r\nindicating its connection with other indigenous growths of the same\r\nsoil, and a vivid sense of the marvellous rapidity and exquisite beauty\r\nof the simultaneous or successive unfoldings. Given these powers,\r\nunhampered by any defect of mere technical skill, and it is hard to see\r\nhow any mind susceptible of being interested in their application to\r\nsuch a topic could resist their sway.\r\n\r\nWe do not know what ideal Mr. Mahaffy may have formed of the task he has\r\nundertaken or of the qualities demanded for it. His preface gives no\r\nintimation on this point, and his \"introduction\" affords only negative\r\nevidence in his refusal to follow \"the usual practice with historians of\r\nGreek literature\" and \"begin with a survey of the character and genius\r\nof the race, the peculiar features of the language, and the action which\r\nphysical circumstances have produced upon the development of all these\r\nthings.\" Instead of any discussions of this nature, which \"in many\r\nGerman books are,\" it appears, \"so long and so vague that the student is\r\nwearied before he arrives at a single fact,\" the natural division of\r\nliterature into poetry and prose is made the starting-point. The former,\r\nin accordance with \"a well-known law of human progress,\" precedes the\r\nlatter, but is gradually supplanted by it. \"This may be seen among us in\r\nthe education of children, who pass in a few years through successive\r\nstages not unlike those of humanity at large in its progress from mental\r\ninfancy to mature thought. We know that little children can be taught to\r\nrepeat and remember rhymes long before they will listen to the simplest\r\nstory in prose.\" On the other hand, \"when the majority of people begin\r\nto read, poetry loses its hold upon the public, and the prose-writer,\r\nwho composes with greater simplicity and less labor, at last obtains an\r\nadvantage over his rival the poet, who is put into competition with all\r\nthe older poets now circulating among a more learned public.\" In\r\naccordance with this profound yet simple theory--from which we gather\r\nthat the Golden Age of the poets was that in which there were no\r\nreaders--the work is divided into two nearly equal parts, the first\r\ndealing with poetry and the second with prose, and this \"is now the\r\naccepted order among the German writers on the subject.\"\r\n\r\nIn the first volume epic, lyric and dramatic poetry are dealt with in\r\nthe order in which they are here named, while in the second the\r\narrangement is strictly chronological, taking up historians,\r\nphilosophers and orators as they appeared upon the scene. Except in the\r\ncase of the epic and the drama there is no examination of the rise or\r\nnature of any particular form of composition, and the exceptions merely\r\ntouch the familiar ground of the origin of the Homeric poems and the\r\nrise of the AEschylean tragedy. Some account is given of the principal\r\nauthors, their works are more or less fully enumerated and some of them\r\nanalyzed, style and similar matters are discussed in a summary and\r\ndecisive tone--critics, ancient and modern, who have held different\r\nviews from those of Mr. Mahaffy being sharply reprehended--and the final\r\nsections of some of the chapters are devoted to bibliography, including\r\nmodern imitations and translations. Although Mr. Mahaffy is never\r\notherwise than terse--or, more properly speaking, curt--he sometimes\r\ncondescends to repetition. Thus he tells us in three or four different\r\nplaces that Sophocles and Thucydides \"play at hide-and-seek with the\r\nreader.\" These two authors, thus happily classed together, represent\r\n\"the artificial obscurity of the Attic epoch,\" in distinction from \"the\r\npregnant obscurity\" of Heracleitus and AEschylus and \"the redundant\r\nobscurity of some modern poets.\" The attempt of \"Classen and others\" to\r\nexplain the involutions and anacolutha of Thucydides by \"the undeveloped\r\ncondition of Attic prose, and the difficulties of wrestling with an\r\nunformed idiom to express adequately great and pregnant thoughts,\" is\r\ntriumphantly refuted by the statement that \"Euripides and Cratinus had\r\nalready perfected the use of Attic Greek in dramatic dialogue,\" and \"in\r\nAttic prose Antiphon had already attained clearness, as we can see in\r\nhis extant speeches.\" As Classen, in his discussion of the question, has\r\nnot omitted to notice Antiphon, it may be doubted whether he would\r\naccept this fact as conclusive. Another point in regard to Thucydides is\r\nintroduced in a manner that prepares us for some startling disclosures:\r\n\"As regards the historian's trustworthiness, it has been so universally\r\nlauded that it is high time to declare how far his statements are to be\r\naccepted as absolute truths.\" But expectation subsides when we are\r\nassured in the next sentence that \"on contemporary facts his authority\r\nis very good, and so far there has been no proof of any inaccuracy\r\nbrought home to him.\" He is open to doubt, it appears, \"only when he\r\ngoes into archaeology,\" by which term Mr. Mahaffy understands early\r\nSicilian history, which \"reaches back three hundred years, nay to three\r\nhundred years before the advent of the Greeks.\" It has \"only lately,\" it\r\nappears, been discovered that Thucydides had no personal knowledge of\r\nthe events of that remote period, but \"copied from Dionysius of\r\nSyracuse,\" and hence \"the whole tradition requires careful\r\nconsideration.\" In that case, we fear, the \"high time\" for deciding on\r\nthe \"absolute truth\" of the historian's statements will have to be\r\nindefinitely postponed. Meantime we learn from the work before us the\r\nstriking fact, that \"the night-escape of the Plateans from their city,\"\r\nas related in the third book of Thucydides, \"has been reproduced in our\r\nown day by Sir E. Creasy, in his Greek novel, _The Old Love and the\r\nNew_.\" It has sometimes been debated whether the Greeks had any novels:\r\nit is now settled that they had one--written by an Englishman. It is to\r\nbe hoped that this discovery will give a new impetus to the interest in\r\nGreek literature, which must be at a low ebb if Mr. Mahaffy be correct\r\nin stating that \"even diligent scholars find it a task to read a\r\ndialogue of Plato honestly through.\" To be sure, if Plato's style and\r\nmatter were simply such as Mr. Mahaffy describes them, there would be no\r\ngreat inducement to make the attempt. The same remark would apply to\r\nmost of the extant plays of Sophocles. The _Oedipus Rex_, in\r\nparticular, reveals itself in Mr. Mahaffy's analysis as a mere farrago\r\nof inconsistencies and absurdities. In allusion to the very different\r\nestimate of Professor Campbell, Mr. Mahaffy remarks, \"Though I deeply\r\nrespect this simple-hearted enthusiasm, it does not appear to me the\r\nbest way of stimulating the study of any writer.\" Still, Mr. Mahaffy can\r\noccasionally defend a Greek author against the strictures of other\r\ncritics. Thus he cannot agree with Mr. Simcox in giving \"some credence\r\nto the attacks on Demosthenes charging him with unchastity. These,\" he\r\nobserves, \"the whole man's life and his portrait-statue forbid us to\r\nbelieve.\" We do not quite understand how the fact that Demosthenes was a\r\n\"whole man\" tends to rebut the charge referred to, and if what Mr.\r\nMahaffy meant to say be \"the man's whole life,\" this is simply begging\r\nthe question, a part of that whole being the point of dispute. But the\r\nevidence of the \"portrait-statue\" is, of course, resistless, and one\r\ncannot but regret, in the interests of public decency, that testimony so\r\nconclusive is not admitted in modern trials involving a similar issue.\r\nOne great characteristic of Mr. Mahaffy's style is an unsparing use of\r\nthe first personal pronoun. \"I think,\" \"I do not think,\" \"I conceive,\"\r\n\"I believe,\" \"I advocate,\" \"I infer,\" \"I would select,\" \"I had\r\npredicted,\" are forms of expression strewn abundantly, often in\r\nclusters, over the pages of the work, the subject to which they refer\r\nbeing generally one on which most other people do not \"think\" or\r\n\"conceive\" as Mr. Mahaffy does. One is reminded of an epigram on\r\nWhewell, master of Trinity College (Oxford, not Dublin), after the\r\nappearance of his _Plurality of Worlds_:\r\n\r\n    His eye, as it ranges through boundless infinity,\r\n    Finds the chief work of God the master of Trinity.\r\n\r\n\r\n     William Cowper. By Goldwin Smith. (English-Men-of-Letters Series.)\r\n     New York: Harper & Brothers.\r\n\r\nMuch thoughtful and sympathetic criticism has been written on the life\r\nand writings of Cowper, without any new facts being brought to light or\r\nany decided progress made. His character reveals itself and his life is\r\nminutely recorded in his correspondence; but the few points which his\r\nletters leave unexplained still remain obscure after long search and\r\nstudy. The question of his rupture with Lady Austen, for instance, is\r\njust where Hayley left it. His poems present elements so apparently\r\nirreconcilable that, while their qualities are universally recognized,\r\ntheir place in literature is still an unsettled one. The reader of _The\r\nTask_ may ask himself in one breath whether it is poetry at all, or\r\nwhether it be not great poetry. There is no trace of the instinctive\r\npoetic utterance of bards such as Shelley and Keats, but there is a\r\nconstant appeal to the strongest and most elementary human feelings,\r\nrarely met with in any but the greatest works of art. It was never\r\nCowper's fate to be exposed to that brilliant but unsympathetic\r\ncriticism which is the most short-sighted kind. No comprehension of him\r\ncan be got without bringing in feeling as a factor of judgment, and it\r\nwould not be singular if the moral beauty of his verse should blind\r\nreaders to its artistic faults. As a matter of fact, however, the\r\ntendency now-a-days is to exaggerate Cowper's position rather than his\r\nqualities, and this arises not from warmth of feeling, but from hasty\r\ndogmatizing. There is a marked difference between _The Task_ and any\r\npoem preceding it, but the distance from _The Task_ to _The Excursion_\r\nis still wider. The resemblance to Wordsworth in the former poem is\r\ntolerably superficial: it is a likeness with a difference. Cowper was\r\nthe observer, not the priest, of Nature, watching her minutely and\r\ntenderly, but with none of Wordsworth's passion. The finest passages in\r\n_The Task_ are wholly descriptive, and of description pure and simple\r\nthere is very little in Wordsworth's writings. Neither is there any\r\nstrong proof of Cowper's influence in the work of his successor, though\r\nthe influence felt most strongly by each was the same--that of Milton.\r\nWhen M. Taine speaks of the revolution effected by Cowper as one of\r\nstyle, when Mr. Lowell characterizes Wordsworth's blank verse as\r\n\"essentially the blank verse of Cowper,\" those eminent critics agree in\r\nexalting Cowper above his age at the very point where he is most closely\r\nbound to it. In sentiment he made a certain advance toward Wordsworth,\r\nthough on a lower plane, but in diction he is distinctly of the\r\neighteenth century. His style is often as artificial as that of any of\r\nits rhymesters: it is full of inversions, freighted with long, formal\r\nwords, and still more marred by others of a false dilettante ring.\r\nWordsworth would never have spoken of \"embellished Nature,\" \"embroidered\r\nbanks,\" or applied the word \"elegant\" to a rose, any more than he would\r\nhave used \"lubricity\" or \"stercoraceous\" in verse.\r\n\r\nYet, formal as Cowper's language often is, narrow as are the ideas which\r\ntake up a large part of his writings, the essence of his poetry is its\r\ntruth. A false note in feeling he seldom struck, and the most artificial\r\nlanguage cannot hinder his lines from going direct to the heart. The\r\nhigh-water mark of his genius was reached in two or three poems in which\r\nthe words are in full harmony with the thought and reflect it limpidly,\r\nwith no attempt at the \"embellishment\" which he too frequently employed.\r\n\r\nIn a book designed to introduce the subject to many readers we could\r\nhave wished for a little more sympathy of tone than Mr. Goldwin Smith\r\nhas allowed himself in his otherwise admirable volume. It is hardly\r\nnecessary, for instance, to insist on the obvious narrowness of Cowper's\r\nreligion. That the book is too short is a failing on the right side, and\r\nchargeable to the plan of the series rather than the writer, whose terse\r\nstyle and excellent arrangement make it full of interest. Cowper's life\r\nand poetry are bound together in a singularly close union. He belongs by\r\ncircumstances rather than by genius to those unfortunate minds which,\r\nthrown off the proper balance, have gained a deeper insight and a\r\nstronger hold upon others through their very weakness. What lends a\r\npeculiar pathos and charm to his figure is the purity and gentleness of\r\nhis mind, the efforts by which he clung to truth in the cruel darkness\r\nof mental disease, and the innocent gayety and light-heartedness which\r\nalternated with gloom. Like Rousseau, Cowper had, by the very reaction\r\nfrom sadness, a rare keenness of enjoyment. Little things were enough to\r\nfeast it, and hence the most trivial matters came naturally into his\r\nverse. His poems have certainly had a varied history. Written to afford\r\noccupation to a mind on the verge of madness, linked with the slightest\r\nevents of his daily life, it has been their fate to serve for a long\r\ntime as poetic tracts, and afterward to be exalted by critics as\r\nprophecies of a new order of things, the beginning of a literary\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Books Received._\r\n\r\n\r\nBarbara; or, Splendid Misery.
