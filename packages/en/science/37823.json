Most genera (30) and about 350 species\r\nlive in the American tropics. _Hyla_ and 10 other genera inhabit Central\r\nAmerica; four of those 10 genera (_Gastrotheca_, _Hemiphractus_,\r\n_Phrynohyas_, and _Phyllomedusa_) are widely distributed in South\r\nAmerica. The other six genera are either restricted to Central America\r\nor have their greatest differentiation there. _Plectrohyla_ and\r\n_Ptychohyla_ inhabit streams in the highlands of southern Mexico and\r\nnorthern Central America; _Diaglena_ and _Triprion_ are casque-headed\r\ninhabitants of arid regions in Mexico and northern Central America.\r\n_Anotheca_ is a tree-hole breeder in cloud forests in Middle America.\r\nThe genus _Smilisca_ is the most widespread geographically and diverse\r\necologically of the Central American genera.\r\n\r\nThe definition of genera in the family Hylidae is difficult owing to the\r\nvast array of species, most of which are poorly known as regards their\r\nosteology, colors in life, and modes of life history. The genera\r\n_Diaglena_, _Triprion_, _Tetraprion_, _Osteocephalus_, _Trachycephalus_,\r\n_Aparasphenodon_, _Corythomantis_, _Hemiphractus_, _Pternohyla_, and\r\n_Anotheca_ have been recognized as distinct from one another and from\r\nthe genus _Hyla_ on the basis of various modifications of dermal bones\r\nof the cranium. _Phyllomedusa_ is recognized on the basis of a vertical\r\npupil and opposable thumb; _Plectrohyla_ is characterized by the\r\npresence of a bony prepollex and the absence of a quadratojugal.\r\n_Gastrotheca_ is distinguished from other hylids by the presence of a\r\npouch in the back of females. A pair of lateral vocal sacs behind the\r\nangles of the jaws and the well-developed dermal glands were used by\r\nDuellman (1956) to distinguish _Phrynohyas_ from _Hyla_. He (1963a)\r\ncited the ventrolateral glands in breeding males as diagnostic of\r\n_Ptychohyla_. Some species groups within the vaguely defined genus\r\n_Hyla_ have equally distinctive characters. The _Hyla septentrionalis_\r\ngroup is characterized by a casque-head, not much different from that in\r\nthe genus _Osteocephalus_ (Trueb, MS). Males in the _Hyla maxima_ group\r\nhave a protruding bony prepollex like that characteristically found in\r\n_Plectrohyla_.\r\n\r\nOntogenetic development, osteology, breeding call, behavior, and ecology\r\nare important in the recognition of species. By utilizing the\r\ncombination of many morphological and biological factors, the genus\r\n_Smilisca_ can be defined reasonably well as a natural, phyletic\r\nassemblage of species. Because the wealth of data pertaining to the\r\nmorphology and biology of _Smilisca_ is lacking for most other tree\r\nfrogs in Middle America it is not possible at present to compare\r\n_Smilisca_ with related groups in more than a general way.\r\n\r\n_Smilisca_ is an excellent example of an Autochthonous Middle American\r\ngenus. As defined by Stuart (1950) the Autochthonous Middle American\r\nfauna originated from \"hanging relicts\" left in Central America by the\r\nancestral fauna that moved into South America and differentiated there\r\nat a time when South America was isolated from North and Middle America.\r\nThe genus _Smilisca_, as we define it, consists of six species, all of\r\nwhich occur in Central America. One species ranges northward to southern\r\nTexas, and one extends southward on the Pacific lowlands of South\r\nAmerica to Ecuador. We consider the genus _Smilisca_ to be composed of\r\nrather generalized hylids. Consequently, an understanding of the\r\nsystematics and zoogeography of the genus can be expected to be of aid\r\nin studying more specialized members of the family.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgments\r\n\r\nExamination of many of the specimens used in our study was possible only\r\nbecause of the cooperation of the curators of many systematic\r\ncollections. For lending specimens or providing working space in their\r\nrespective institutions we are grateful to Doris M. Cochran, Alice G. C.\r\nGrandison, Jean Guibe, Robert F. Inger, Guenther Peters, Gerald Raun,\r\nWilliam J. Riemer, Jay M. Savage, Hobart M. Smith, Wilmer W. Tanner,\r\nCharles F. Walker, Ernest E. Williams, and Richard G. Zweifel.\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to Charles J. Cole and Charles W. Myers for able\r\nassistance in the field. The cooperation of Martin H. Moynihan at Barro\r\nColorado Island, Charles M. Keenan of Corozal, Canal Zone, and Robert\r\nHunter of San Jose, Costa Rica, is gratefully acknowledged. Jay M.\r\nSavage turned over to us many Costa Rican specimens and aided greatly in\r\nour work in Costa Rica. James A. Peters helped us locate sites of\r\ncollections in Ecuador and Coleman J. Goin provided a list of localities\r\nfor the genus in Colombia.\r\n\r\nWe especially thank Charles J. Cole for contributing the information on\r\nthe chromosomes, and Robert R. Patterson for preparing osteological\r\nspecimens. We thank M. J. Fouquette, Jr., who read the section on\r\nbreeding calls and offered constructive criticism.\r\n\r\nPermits for collecting were generously provided by Ing. Rodolfo\r\nHernandez Corzo in Mexico, Sr. Jorge A. Ibarra in Guatemala, and Ing.\r\nMilton Lopez in Costa Rica. This report was made possible by support\r\nfrom the National Science Foundation (Grants G-9827 and GB-1441) and the\r\ncooperation of the Museum of Natural History at the University of\r\nKansas. Some of the field studies were carried out in Panama under the\r\nauspices of a grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH\r\nGM-12020) in cooperation with the Gorgas Memorial Laboratory in Panama.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaterials and Methods\r\n\r\nIn our study we examined 4151 preserved frogs, 93 skeletal preparations,\r\n88 lots of tadpoles and young, and six lots of eggs. We have collected\r\nspecimens in the field of all of the species. Observations on behavior\r\nand life history were begun by the senior author in Mexico in 1956 and\r\ncompleted by us in Central America in 1964 and 1965.\r\n\r\nOsteological data were obtained from dried skeletons and cleaned and\r\nstained specimens of all species, plus serial sections of the skull of\r\n_Smilisca baudini_. Developmental stages to which tadpoles are assigned\r\nare in accordance with the table of development published by Gosner\r\n(1960). Breeding calls were recorded in the field on tape using\r\nMagnemite and Uher portable tape recorders. Audiospectrographs were made\r\nby means of a Vibralyzer (Kay Electric Company). External morphological\r\nfeatures were measured in the manner described by Duellman (1956). In\r\nthe accounts of the species we have attempted to give a complete\r\nsynonymy. At the end of each species account the localities from which\r\nspecimens were examined are listed alphabetically within each state,\r\nprovince, or department, which in turn are listed alphabetically within\r\neach country. The countries are arranged from north to south.\r\nAbbreviations for museum specimens are listed below:\r\n\r\n  AMNH--American Museum of Natural History\r\n  BMNH--British Museum (Natural History)\r\n  BYU--Brigham Young University\r\n  CNHM--Chicago Natural History Museum\r\n  KU--University of Kansas Museum of Natural History\r\n  MCZ--Museum of Comparative Zoology\r\n  MNHN--Museu National d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris\r\n  UF--University of Florida Collections\r\n  UIMNH--University of Illinois Museum of Natural History\r\n  UMMZ--University of Michigan Museum of Zoology\r\n  USC--University of Southern California\r\n  USNM--United States National Museum\r\n  TNHC--Texas Natural History Collection, University of Texas\r\n  ZMB--Zoologisches Museum Berlin\r\n\r\n\r\n=Genus Smilisca= Cope, 1865\r\n\r\n  _Smilisca_ Cope, Proc.

Hist, 15(4):193, Oct. 26, 1962.\r\n\r\n_Diagnosis._--Size large ([M] 76 mm., [F] 90 mm.); skull noticeably\r\nwider than long, having small frontoparietal fontanelle (roofed with\r\nbone in large individuals); postorbital processes long, pointed, curving\r\nalong posterior border of orbit; squamosal large, contacting maxillary;\r\ntarsal fold strong, full length of tarsus; inner metatarsal tubercle\r\nlarge, high, elliptical; hind limbs relatively short, tibia length less\r\nthan 55 per cent snout-vent length; lips strongly barred with brown and\r\ncreamy tan; flanks pale cream with bold brown or black reticulations in\r\ngroin; posterior surfaces of thighs brown with cream-colored flecks;\r\ndorsal surfaces of limbs marked with dark brown transverse bands.\r\n(Foregoing combination of characters distinguishing _S. baudini_ from\r\nany other species in genus.)\r\n\r\n_Description and Variation._--Considerable variation in size, and in\r\ncertain proportions and structural characters was observed; variation in\r\nsome characters seems to show geographic trends, whereas variation in\r\nother characters apparently is random. Noticeable variation is evident\r\nin coloration, but this will be discussed later.\r\n\r\nIn order to analyze geographic variation in size and proportions, ten\r\nadult males from each of 14 samples from various localities throughout\r\nthe range of the species were measured. Snout-vent length, length of the\r\ntibia in relation to snout-vent length, and relative size of the\r\ntympanum to the eye are the only measurements and proportions that vary\r\nnoticeably (Table 1). The largest specimens are from southern Sinaloa;\r\nindividuals from the Atlantic lowlands of Alta Verapaz in Guatemala,\r\nHonduras, and Costa Rica are somewhat smaller, and most specimens from\r\nthe Pacific lowlands of Central America are slightly smaller than those\r\nfrom the Atlantic lowlands. The smallest males are from the Atlantic\r\nlowlands of Mexico, including Tamaulipas, Veracruz, the Yucatan\r\nPeninsula, and British Honduras.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Table 1.--Geographic Variation in Size and Proportions in Males of\r\n     Smilisca baudini.

The average ratio in samples from the\r\nPacific lowlands varies from 44.9 in Sinaloa and El Salvador to 47.8 in\r\nGuerrero; on the Gulf lowlands of Mexico the average ratio varies from\r\n45.6 in Veracruz to 47.6 on Isla del Carmen, Campeche. Specimens from\r\nthe Yucatan Peninsula and the Caribbean lowlands have relatively longer\r\nlegs; the variation in average ratios ranges from 49.1 in British\r\nHonduras to 51.2 in Costa Rica and 51.5 in Honduras.\r\n\r\nSpecimens from southern Sinaloa are outstanding in the large size of\r\nthe tympanum; the tympanum/eye ratio varies from 84.2 to 94.4 (average\r\n87.8). In most other samples the variation in average ratios ranges from\r\n72.2 to 79.3, but specimens from Veracruz have an average ratio of 70.0;\r\nCampeche, 65.7; Honduras, 67.0; and Limon, Costa Rica, 68.5.\r\n\r\nNo noticeable geographic trends in size and proportions are evident.\r\nSpecimens from southern Sinaloa are extreme in their large size,\r\nrelatively short tibia, and large tympani, but in size and relative\r\nlength of the tibia the Sinaloan frogs are approached by specimens from\r\nsuch far-removed localities as San Salvador, El Salvador, and Chinaja,\r\nGuatemala. Frogs from the Caribbean lowlands of Honduras and Costa Rica\r\nare relatively large and have relatively long tibiae and small tympani.\r\n\r\nThe inner metatarsal tubercle is large and high and its shape varies.\r\nThe tubercle is most pronounced in specimens from northwestern Mexico,\r\nTamaulipas, and the Pacific lowlands of Central America. Possibly the\r\nlarge tubercle is associated with drier habitats, where perhaps the\r\nfrogs use the tubercles for digging.\r\n\r\nThe ground color of _Smilisca baudini_ is pale green to brown dorsally\r\nand white to creamy yellow ventrally. The dorsum is variously marked\r\nwith dark brown or dark olive-green spots or blotches (Pl. 6A). In most\r\nspecimens a dark interorbital bar extends across the head to the lateral\r\nedges of the eyelid; usually this bar is connected medially to a large\r\ndorsal blotch. There is no tendency for the markings on the dorsum to\r\nform transverse bands or longitudinal bars. In specimens from the\r\nsouthern part of the range the dorsal dark markings are often fragmented\r\ninto small spots, especially posteriorly. The limbs are marked by dark\r\ntransverse bands, usually three on the forearm, three on the thigh, and\r\nthree or four on the shank. Transverse bands also are present on the\r\ntarsi and proximal segments of the fingers and toes. The webbing on the\r\nhands and feet is pale grayish brown. The loreal region and upper lip\r\nare pale green or tan; the lip usually is boldly marked with broad\r\nvertical dark brown bars, especially evident is the bar beneath the eye.\r\nA dark brown or black mark extends from the tympanum to a point above\r\nthe insertion of the forearm; in some specimens this black mark is\r\nnarrow or indistinct, but in most individuals it is quite evident. The\r\nflanks are pale gray to creamy white with brown or black mottling, which\r\nsometimes forms reticulations enclosing white spots. The anterior\r\nsurfaces of the thighs usually are creamy white with brown mottling,\r\nwhereas the posterior surfaces of the thighs usually are brown with\r\nsmall cream-colored flecks. A distinct creamy white anal stripe usually\r\nis present. Usually, there are no white stripes on the outer edges of\r\nthe tarsi and forearms. In breeding males the throat is gray.\r\n\r\nMost variation in coloration does not seem to be correlated with\r\ngeography. The lips are strongly barred in specimens from throughout the\r\nrange of the species, except that in some specimens from southern\r\nNicaragua and Costa Rica the lips are pale and in some specimens the\r\nvertical bars are indistinct. Six specimens from 7.3 kilometers\r\nsouthwest of Matatan, Sinaloa, are distinctively marked. The dorsum is\r\nuniformly grayish green with the only dorsal marks being on the tarsi;\r\ncanthal and post-tympanic dark marks absent. A broad white labial stripe\r\nis present and interrupted by a single vertical dark mark below the eye.\r\nA white stripe is present on the outer edge of the foot. The flanks and\r\nposterior surfaces of the thighs are creamy white, boldly marked with\r\nblack. Two specimens from Alta Verapaz, Guatemala (CNHM 21006 from\r\nCoban and UMMZ 90908 from Finca Canihor), are distinctive in having many\r\nnarrow transverse bands on the limbs and fine reticulations on the\r\nflanks. Two specimens from Limon Province, Costa Rica (KU 34927 from\r\nBatan and 36789 from Suretka), lack a dorsal pattern; instead these\r\nspecimens are nearly uniform brown above and have only a few small dark\r\nbrown spots on the back and lack transverse bands on the limbs. The\r\npost-tympanic dark marks and dark mottling on the flanks are absent.\r\nSpecimens lacking the usual dorsal markings are known from scattered\r\nlocalities on the Caribbean lowlands from Guatemala to Costa Rica.\r\n\r\nThe coloration in life is highly variable; much of the apparent\r\nvariation is due to metachrosis, for individuals of _Smilisca baudini_\r\nare capable of undergoing drastic and rapid change in coloration. When\r\nactive at night the frogs usually are pale bright green with olive-green\r\nmarkings, olive-green with brown markings, or pale brown with dark brown\r\nmarkings. The dark markings on the back and dorsal surfaces of the limbs\r\nare narrowly outlined by black. The pale area below the eye and just\r\nposterior to the broad suborbital dark bar is creamy white, pale green,\r\nor ashy gray in life. The presence of this mark is an excellent\r\ncharacter by which to identify juveniles of the species. The flanks are\r\ncreamy yellow, or yellow with brown or black mottling. In most\r\nindividuals the belly is white, but in specimens from southern El Peten\r\nand northern Alta Verapaz, Guatemala, the belly is yellow, especially\r\nposteriorly. The iris varies from golden bronze to dull bronze with\r\nblack reticulations, somewhat darker ventrally.\r\n\r\n_Natural History._--Throughout most of its range _Smilisca baudini_\r\noccurs in sub-humid habitats; consequently the activity is controlled by\r\nthe seasonal nature of the rainfall and usually extends from May or June\r\nthrough September. Throughout Mexico and Central America the species is\r\nknown to call and breed in June, July, and August. Several records\r\nindicate that the breeding season in Central America is more lengthy.\r\nGaige, Hartweg, and Stuart (1937:4) noted gravid females collected at El\r\nRecreo, Nicaragua, in August and September. Schmidt (1941:486) reported\r\ncalling males in February in British Honduras. Stuart (1958:17) stated\r\nthat tadpoles were found in mid-February, juveniles in February and\r\nMarch and half-grown individuals from mid-March to mid-May at Tikal, El\r\nPeten, Guatemala. Stuart (1961:74) reported juveniles from Tikal in\r\nJuly, and that individuals were active at night when there had been\r\nlight rain in the dry season in February and March in El Peten,\r\nGuatemala. _Smilisca baudini_ seeks daytime retreats in bromeliads,\r\nelephant-ear plants (_Xanthosoma_), and beneath bark or in holes in\r\ntrees. By far the most utilized retreat in the dry season in parts of\r\nthe range is beneath the outer sheaths of banana plants. Large numbers\r\nof these frogs were found in banana plants at Cuautlapan, Veracruz, in\r\nMarch, 1956, in March and December, 1959.\r\n\r\nLarge breeding congregations of this frog are often found at the time of\r\nthe first heavy rains in the wet season. Gadow (1908:76) estimated\r\n45,000 frogs at one breeding site in Veracruz. In the vicinity of\r\nTehuantepec, Oaxaca, large numbers of individuals were found around rain\r\npools and roadside ditches in July, 1956, and July, 1958; large\r\nconcentrations were found near Chinaja, Guatemala, in June, 1960, and\r\nnear Esparta, Costa Rica in July, 1961. Usually males call from the\r\nground at the edge of the water or not infrequently sit in shallow\r\nwater, but sometimes males call from bushes and low trees around the\r\nwater. Stuart (1935:38) recorded individuals calling and breeding\r\nthroughout the day at La Libertad, Guatemala. _Smilisca baudini_ usually\r\nis absent from breeding congregations of hylids; frequently _S. baudini_\r\nbreeds alone in small temporary pools separated from large ponds where\r\nnumerous other species are breeding. In Guerrero and Oaxaca, Mexico, _S.\r\nbaudini_ breeds in the same ponds with _Rhinophrynus dorsalis_, _Bufo\r\nmarmoreus_, _Engystomops pustulosus_, and _Diaglena reticulata_, and in\r\nthe vicinity of Esparta, Costa Rica, _S. baudini_ breeds in ponds with\r\n_Bufo coccifer_, _Hyla staufferi_, and _Phrynohyas venulosa_. In nearly\r\nall instances the breeding sites of _S. baudini_ are shallow, temporary\r\npools.\r\n\r\nThe breeding call of _Smilisca baudini_ consists of a series of short\r\nexplosive notes. Each note has a duration of 0.09 to 0.13 seconds; two\r\nto 15 notes make up a call group. Individual call groups are spaced from\r\nabout 15 seconds to several minutes apart. The notes are moderately\r\nhigh-pitched and resemble \"wonk-wonk-wonk.\" Little vibration is\r\ndiscernible in the notes, which have 140 to 195 pulses per second and a\r\ndominant frequency of 2400 to 2725 cycles per second (Pl. 10A).\r\n\r\nThe eggs are laid as a surface film on the water in temporary pools. The\r\nonly membrane enclosing the individual eggs is the vitelline membrane.\r\nIn ten eggs (KU 62154 from San Salvador, El Salvador) the average\r\ndiameter of the embryos in first cleavage is 1.3 mm. and of the\r\nvitelline membranes, 1.5 mm. Hatchling tadpoles have body lengths of 2.6\r\nto 2.7 mm. and total lengths of 5.1 to 5.4 mm. The body and caudal\r\nmusculature is brown; the fins are densely flecked with brown. The gills\r\nare long and filamentous. Growth and development of tadpoles are\r\nsummarized in Table 9.\r\n\r\nA typical tadpole in stage 30 of development (KU 60018 from Chinaja,\r\nAlta Verapaz, Guatemala) has a body length of 8.7 mm., a tail length of\r\n13.6 mm., and a total length of 22.3 mm.; body slightly wider than deep;\r\nsnout rounded dorsally and laterally; eyes widely separated, directed\r\ndorsolaterally; nostril about midway between eye and tip of snout; mouth\r\nanteroventral; spiracle sinistral, located about midway on length of\r\nbody and slightly below midline; anal tube dextral; caudal musculature\r\nslender, slightly curved upward distally; dorsal fin extending onto\r\nbody, deepest at about one-third length of tail; depth of dorsal fin\r\nslightly more than that of ventral fin at mid-length of tail; dorsal\r\npart of body dark brown; pale crescent-shaped mark on posterior part of\r\nbody; ventral surfaces transparent with scattered brown pigment\r\nventrolaterally, especially below eye; caudal musculature pale tan with\r\na dark brown longitudinal streak on middle of anterior one-third of\r\ntail; dorsum of anterior one-third of tail dark brown; brown flecks and\r\nblotches on rest of caudal musculature, on all of dorsal fin, and on\r\nposterior two-thirds of ventral fin; iris bronze in life (Fig. 11).\r\nMouth small; median third of upper lip bare; rest of mouth bordered by\r\ntwo rows of conical papillae; lateral fold present; tooth rows 2/3; two\r\nupper rows about equal in length; second row broadly interrupted\r\nmedially, three lower rows complete, first and second equal in length,\r\nslightly shorter than upper rows; third lower row shortest; first upper\r\nrow sharply curved anteriorly in midline; upper beak moderately deep,\r\nforming a board arch with slender lateral processes; lower beak more\r\nslender, broadly V-shaped; both beaks bearing blunt serrations\r\n(Fig. 15A).\r\n\r\nIn tadpoles having fully developed mouthparts the tooth-row formula of\r\n2/3 is invariable, but the coloration is highly variable. The color and\r\npattern described above is about average. Some tadpoles are much\r\ndarker, such as those from 11 kilometers north of Vista Hermosa, Oaxaca,\r\n(KU 87639-44), 3.5 kilometers east of Yokdzonot, Yucatan (KU 71720), and\r\n4 kilometers west-southwest Puerto Juarez, Quintana Roo, Mexico (KU\r\n71721), whereas others, notably from 17 kilometers northeast of\r\nJuchatengo, Oaxaca, Mexico (KU 87645), are much paler and lack the dark\r\nmarkings on the caudal musculature. The variation in intensity of\r\npigmentation possibly can be correlated with environmental conditions,\r\nespecially the amount of light. In general, tadpoles that were found in\r\nopen, sunlit pools are pallid by comparison with those from shaded\r\nforest pools. These subjective comparisons were made with preserved\r\nspecimens; detailed comparative data on living tadpoles are not\r\navailable.\r\n\r\nThe relative length and depth of the tail are variable; in some\r\nindividuals the greatest depth of the tail is about at mid-length of the\r\ntail, whereas in most specimens the tail is deepest at about one-third\r\nits length. The length of the tail relative to the total length\r\nis usually 58 to 64 per cent in tadpoles in stages 29 and 30 of\r\ndevelopment. In some individuals the tail is about 70 per cent of the\r\ntotal length. On the basis of the material examined, these variations in\r\nproportions do not show geographical trends. Probably the proportions\r\nare a reflection of crowding of the tadpoles in the pools where they are\r\ndeveloping or possibly due to water currents or other environmental\r\nfactors.\r\n\r\nStuart (1948:26) described and illustrated the tadpole of _Smilisca\r\nbaudini_ from Finca Chejel, Alta Verapaz, Guatemala. The description and\r\nfigures agree with ours, except that the first lower tooth row does not\r\nhave a sharp angle medially in Stuart's figure. He (1948:27) stated that\r\ncolor in tadpoles from different localities probably varies with\r\nsoil color and turbidity of water. Maslin (1963:125) described and\r\nillustrated tadpoles of _S. baudini_ from Piste, Yucatan, Mexico. These\r\nspecimens are heavily pigmented like specimens that we have examined\r\nfrom the Yucatan Peninsula and from other places in the range of the\r\nspecies. Maslin stated that the anal tube is median in the specimens\r\nthat he examined; we have not studied Maslin's specimens, but all\r\ntadpoles of _Smilisca_ that we have examined have a dextral anal tube.\r\n\r\nNewly metamorphosed young have snout-vent lengths of 12.0 to 15.5 mm.\r\n(average 13.4 in 23 specimens). The largest young are from La Libertad,\r\nEl Peten, Guatemala; these have snout-vent lengths of 14.0 to 15.5 mm.\r\n(average 14.5 in five specimens). Young from 11 kilometers north of\r\nVista Hermosa, Oaxaca, Mexico, are the smallest and have snout-vent\r\nlengths of 12.0 to 12.5 mm. (average 12.3 in three specimens). Recently\r\nmetamorphosed young usually are dull olive green above and white below;\r\nbrown transverse bands are visible on the hind limbs. The labial\r\nmarkings characteristic of the adults are represented only by a creamy\r\nwhite suborbital spot, which is a good diagnostic mark for young of this\r\nspecies. In life the iris is pale gold.\r\n\r\n_Remarks_: The considerable variation in color and the extensive\r\ngeographic distribution of _Smilisca baudini_ have resulted in the\r\nproposal of eight specific names for the frogs that we consider to\r\nrepresent one species. Dumeril and Bibron (1841:564) proposed the name\r\n_Hyla baudini_ for a specimen (MNHN 4798) from Mexico. Smith and Taylor\r\n(1950:347) restricted the type locality to Cordoba, Veracruz, Mexico, an\r\narea where the species occurs in abundance. Baird (1854:61) named _Hyla\r\nvanvlieti_ from Brownsville, Texas, and (1859:35) labelled the figures\r\nof _Hyla vanvlieti_ [= _Hyla baudini_] on plate 38 as _Hyla vociferans_,\r\na _nomen nudum_. Cope (1862:359) named _Hyla muricolor_ from Mirador,\r\nVeracruz, Mexico, and (1865:194) used the name _Smilisca daulinia_ for\r\na skeleton that he employed as the basis for the cranial characters\r\ndiagnostic of the genus _Smilisca_, as defined by him. Although we\r\ncannot be certain, Cope apparently inadvertently used _daulinia_ for\r\n_baudini_, just as he used _daudinii_ for _baudini_ (1871:205).

All unquestionably are representatives of\r\n_S. baudini_.\r\n\r\nTaylor (1942:306) named _Hyla beltrani_ from Tapachula, Chiapas. This\r\nspecimen (UIMNH 25046) is a small female (snout-vent length, 44 mm.) of\r\n_S. baudini_. Taylor (1954:630) named _Hyla manisorum_ from Batan,\r\nLimon, Costa Rica. The type (KU 34927) is a large female (snout-vent\r\nlength, 75.3 mm.) _S. baudini_. In this specimen and a male from\r\nSuretka, Costa Rica, the usual dorsal color pattern is absent, but the\r\ndistinctive curved supraorbital processes, together with other\r\nstructural features, show that the two specimens are _S. baudini_.\r\n\r\n_Hyla baudini dolomedes_ Barbour (1923:11), as shown by Dunn\r\n(1931a:413), was based on a specimen of _Smilisca phaeota_ from Rio\r\nEsnape, Darien, Panama.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 1. Map showing locality records for _Smilisca\r\n       baudini_.]\r\n\r\n_Distribution_.--_Smilisca baudini_ inhabits lowlands and foothills\r\nusually covered by xerophytic vegetation or savannas, but in the\r\nsouthern part of its range _baudini_ inhabits tropical evergreen forest.\r\nThe species ranges throughout the Pacific and Atlantic lowlands of\r\nMexico from southern Sonora and the Rio Grande embayment of Texas\r\nsouthward to Costa Rica, where on the Pacific lowlands the range\r\nterminates at the southern limits of the arid tropical forest in the\r\nvicinity of Esparta; on the Caribbean lowlands the distribution seems\r\nto be discontinuous southward to Suretka (Fig. 1). Most localities where\r\nthe species has been collected are at elevations of less than 1000\r\nmeters. Three localities are notably higher; calling males were found at\r\nsmall temporary ponds in pine-oak forest at Linda Vista, 2 kilometers\r\nnorthwest of Pueblo Nuevo Solistahuacan, Chiapas, elevation 1675 meters,\r\nand 10 kilometers northwest of Comitan, Chiapas, at an elevation of 1925\r\nmeters. Tadpoles and metamorphosing young were obtained from a pond in\r\narid scrub forest, 17 kilometers northeast of Juchatengo, Oaxaca,\r\nelevation 1600 meters. Stuart (1954:46) recorded the species at\r\nelevations up to 1400 meters in the south-eastern highlands of\r\nGuatemala.\r\n\r\n_Specimens examined._--3006, as follows: UNITED STATES: TEXAS: Cameron\r\nCounty, Brownsville, CNHM 5412-3, 6869, UMMZ 54036, USNM 3256.\r\n\r\nMEXICO: =Campeche=: Balchacaj, CNHM 102285, 102288, 102291, 102311,\r\nUIMNH 30709-22, 30726; Champoton, UMMZ 73172 (2), 73176, 73180; 16 km.

(Foregoing combination of characters\r\ndistinguishing _S. cyanosticta_ from any other species in genus.)\r\n\r\n_Description and Variation._--The largest males are from Piedras Negras,\r\nEl Peten, Guatemala, and they average 52.5 mm. in snout-vent length\r\nwhereas males from Los Tuxtlas, Veracruz, average 50.6 mm. and those\r\nfrom northern Oaxaca 50.3 mm. The smallest breeding male has a\r\nsnout-vent length of 44.6 mm. The average ratio of tibia length to\r\nsnout-vent length is 54.8 per cent in males from Piedras Negras,\r\nand 56.4 and 56.3 per cent in males from Los Tuxtlas and Oaxaca,\r\nrespectively. The only other character showing noticeable geographic\r\nvariation is the size of the tympanum. The average ratio of the diameter\r\nof the tympanum to the diameter of the eye is 76.3 per cent in males\r\nfrom Piedras Negras, 71.8 from Oaxaca, and 66.9 from Los Tuxtlas.\r\n\r\nThe dorsal ground color of _Smilisca cyanosticta_ is pale green to tan\r\nand the venter is creamy white. The dorsum is variously marked with dark\r\nolive-green or dark brown spots or blotches (Pl. 6B). An interorbital\r\ndark bar usually is present. The most extensive dark area is a V-shaped\r\nmark in the occipital region with the anterior branches not reaching the\r\neyelids; this mark is continuous, by means of a narrow mid-dorsal mark,\r\nwith an inverted V-shaped mark in the sacral region. In many specimens\r\nthis dorsal marking is interrupted, resulting in irregular spots. In\r\nsome specimens the dorsum is nearly uniform pale green or tan with a few\r\nsmall, dark spots. The hind limbs are marked by dark transverse bands,\r\nusually three or four each on the thigh and shank, and two or three on\r\nthe tarsus. The webbing on the feet is brown. The loreal region is pale\r\ngreen, bordered above by a narrow, dark brown canthal stripe extending\r\nfrom the nostril to the orbit, which is bordered above by a narrow,\r\nbronze-colored stripe extending from the nostril along the edge of the\r\neyelid to a point above the tympanum. The upper lip is white. A broad\r\ndark brown mark extends posteriorly from the orbit and encompasses the\r\ntympanum to a point above the insertion of the forelimb. The flanks are\r\ndark brown with many pale blue, rounded spots, giving the impression of\r\na pale blue ground color with dark brown mottling enclosing spots. The\r\nanterior and posterior surfaces of the thighs are dark brown with many\r\nsmall pale blue spots. The inner surfaces of the shank and tarsus are\r\ncolored like the posterior surfaces of the thighs. Pale blue spots are\r\nusually present on the proximal segments of the second and third toes. A\r\ndistinct white stripe is present on the outer edge of the tarsus and\r\nfifth toe; on the tarsus the white stripe is bordered below by dark\r\nbrown. A white stripe also is present on the outer edge of the forearm\r\nand fourth finger. The anal region is dark brown, bordered above by a\r\nnarrow transverse white stripe. The throat in breeding males is dark,\r\ngrayish brown with white flecks.\r\n\r\nNo geographic variation in the dorsal coloration is evident. Specimens\r\nfrom the eastern part of the range (Piedras Negras and Chinaja,\r\nGuatemala) have bold, dark reticulations on the flanks enclosing large\r\npale blue or pale green spots, which fade to tan in preservative.\r\nSpecimens from Oaxaca and Veracruz characteristically have finer dark\r\nreticulations on the flanks enclosing smaller blue spots; in many of\r\nthese specimens the ventrolateral spots are smallest and are white.\r\n\r\nAll living adults are easily recognized by the presence of pale, usually\r\nblue, spots on the flanks and thighs. Individuals under cover by day\r\nhave a tan dorsum with dark brown markings. A hiding individual at\r\nChinaja, Alta Verapaz, Guatemala (KU 55936), had a pale tan dorsum when\r\nfound; later the dorsal color changed to chocolate brown. A pale green\r\npatch was present below the eye; the spots on the posterior surfaces of\r\nthe thighs were pale blue, and those on the flanks were yellowish green.\r\nA calling male obtained 10 kilometers north-northwest of Chinaja (KU\r\n55934) was reddish brown when found at night; later the dorsal color\r\nchanged to pale tan. A green patch below the eye was persistent. Usually\r\nthese frogs are green at night. The coloration of an adult male (KU\r\n87201) from 11 kilometers north of Vista Hermosa, Oaxaca, Mexico, was\r\ntypical: \"When calling dorsum pale green; later changed to dull\r\nolive-green. Flanks dark brown with pale blue spots in axilla and groin\r\nand bluish white flecks on mid-flank. Anterior and posterior surfaces of\r\nthighs, inner surfaces of shanks, and median dorsal surfaces of tarsi\r\ndark brown with blue spots. Canthal and postorbital stripes dark\r\nchocolate brown; labial stripe creamy white. Forearm, tarsal, and anal\r\nstripes pale cream-color. Throat dark brown with yellow flecks; belly\r\nand ventral surfaces of limbs creamy buff; webs pinkish tan; iris deep\r\nbronze, brown below pupil.\" (Duellman, field notes, June 24, 1964.)\r\n\r\nSome individuals have both green and brown coloration in life. An\r\nindividual obtained at night on the south slope of Volcan San Martin,\r\nVeracruz, Mexico, had a pale tan dorsum changing peripherally to pale\r\ngreen. The dorsal markings were dark brown and dark olive-green.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the color-changes noted above, the labial region below\r\nthe eye is always pale green, and pale spots are always present on the\r\nflanks and thighs in adults. The iris is invariably golden or bronze\r\nabove and darker, usually brown, below. Minute black flecks are present\r\non the iris, and in some individuals these flecks are so numerous that\r\nthe eye appears gray.\r\n\r\nRecently metamorphosed young have pale tan flanks, and the posterior\r\nsurfaces of the thighs are orange-yellow; pale spots are absent. A\r\njuvenile (KU 55935) from Chinaja, Alta Verapaz, Guatemala, having a\r\nsnout-vent length of 35.0 mm. was pale yellowish tan above with\r\nolive-green markings; the flanks were dark brown with pale blue spots,\r\nand the anterior and posterior surfaces of the thighs were uniform\r\nbright tomato red. A juvenile (UMMZ 121298), 18.6 mm. in snout-vent\r\nlength, from the southeast slope of Volcan San Martin, Veracruz, Mexico,\r\nhad pale tan flanks lacking blue spots, but had red thighs. Apparently\r\nthe ontogenetic changes in coloration proceed as follows: (1) flanks\r\npale tan and thighs orange-yellow, both lacking spots, (2) flanks pale\r\ntan and thighs red, both lacking spots, (3) flanks dark brown with blue\r\nspots and thighs red, lacking spots, and (4) flanks and thighs dark\r\nbrown, both having pale blue spots.\r\n\r\n_Natural History._--_Smilisca cyanosticta_ inhabits humid tropical\r\nforest and cloud forest from the lowlands to elevations of about 1200\r\nmeters in Los Tuxtlas and to about 900 meters in northern Oaxaca. In\r\nthese moist environments the frogs apparently are active throughout the\r\nyear. Active individuals have been obtained in January, July, and August\r\nin Los Tuxtlas, Veracruz, in June and July in northern Oaxaca, in\r\nFebruary and March at Chinaja, Guatemala, and Taylor and Smith reported\r\n(1945:589) activity in May at Piedras Negras, Guatemala. Calling males\r\nwere observed as follows; in a rain barrel 11 kilometers north of Vista\r\nHermosa, Oaxaca, Mexico, on June 23-28, 1964; in a quiet pool in a\r\nstream 8 kilometers south of Yetla, Oaxaca, Mexico, in July, 1963 (Dale\r\nL. Hoyt, personal communication); in and near springs flowing into a\r\nstream at Dos Amates, Veracruz, Mexico, on August 4, 1959 (Douglas\r\nRobinson, personal communication); and in a water-filled depression in a\r\nlog 10 kilometers west-northwest of Chinaja, Guatemala, on March 13,\r\n1960. Taylor and Smith (1945:589) reported that individuals were found\r\nat night on the ground at the edge of temporary pools at Piedras Negras,\r\nGuatemala, on May 28-29, 1939. A clasping pair was found on a rock at\r\nthe edge of a small stream on the south slope of Volcan San Martin,\r\nVeracruz, Mexico, on July 11, 1959 (Douglas Robinson, personal\r\ncommunication).\r\n\r\nOnly one individual has been observed in a tree at night. In the\r\ndaytime, individuals were found in elephant ear plants (_Xanthosoma_) at\r\nChinaja, Guatemala.\r\n\r\nThe breeding call consists of one or two moderately short notes that are\r\nlower pitched than those of _S. baudini_, but higher pitched than those\r\nof _S. phaeota_. Each note has a duration of 0.25 to 0.45 seconds and is\r\nrepeated at intervals of one-half minute to several minutes. Each note\r\nis a vibrant \"waunk,\" having 110 to 180 pulses per second and dominant\r\nfrequency of 1600 to 2100 cycles per second (Pl. 10B).\r\n\r\nApparently the eggs are deposited as loose clumps in the water. In eggs\r\nin the yolk plug stage of development, the diameter of the embryo is\r\nabout 2.3 mm.; that of the outer envelope is 4.0 mm. Hatchling tadpoles\r\nhave total lengths of 5.8 to 6.5 mm. and body lengths of 2.8 to 3.1 mm.\r\nThe external gills are moderately long, slender, and filamentous; the\r\nyolk sac is still moderately large. The body and anterior part of the\r\ncaudal musculature are dark brown; posteriorly the caudal musculature is\r\npale brown. The caudal fins are creamy tan. The oral discs are large and\r\novoid. The growth of the tadpole is summarized in Table 10.\r\n\r\nA typical tadpole in stage 30 of development (KU 87652 from 11 km. N\r\nVista Hermosa, Oaxaca, Mexico) can be described as follows:\r\n\r\nBody length 9.5 mm.; tail length 15.5 mm.; total length 25.0 mm.; body\r\nslightly wider than deep; snout rounded laterally, broadly ovoid\r\ndorsally; eyes widely separated, directed dorsolaterally; nostril about\r\nmidway between eye and tip of snout; mouth anteroventral; spiracle\r\nsinistral, slightly posterior to midpoint of body and slightly below\r\nmidline; anal tube dextral; caudal musculature slender, barely curved\r\nupward distally; dorsal fin not extending onto body, depth of dorsal fin\r\nslightly more than that of ventral fin on mid-length of tail; dorsal\r\npart of body dark brown; ventral surfaces transparent, lacking pigment;\r\nposterior edge of body pale cream-color; caudal musculature creamy white\r\nwith interconnected brown spots; caudal fins transparent with small\r\nbrown blotches on dorsal fin and posterior half of ventral fin; iris\r\ncoppery bronze in life (Fig. 12). Mouth small, median part of upper lip\r\nbare; rest of mouth bordered by single row of bluntly rounded papillae;\r\nlateral fold present; tooth rows 2/3; all tooth-rows approximately equal\r\nin length; second upper row broadly interrupted medially; other rows\r\ncomplete; upper beak moderately deep, forming broad arch with slender\r\nlateral processes; lower beak slender, broadly V-shaped; both beaks\r\nfinely serrate (Fig. 15C).\r\n\r\nAll tadpoles having fully developed mouth parts have 2/3 tooth rows.\r\nLittle variation is noticeable in coloration. In many specimens the\r\nposterior edge of the body is dark brown instead of pale cream-color.\r\nMottling is rather dense on the caudal fins in all specimens; in some\r\nindividuals pigment is concentrated along the anterior one-third of the\r\nlateral groove. In life the body is dark brown with greenish gold flecks\r\nventrally; the caudal musculature is gray.\r\n\r\nIn each of two recently metamorphosed young the snout-vent length is\r\n14.0 mm. Coloration of young in life (KU 87653 from 11 km. N Vista\r\nHermosa, Oaxaca, Mexico): \"Dorsum pale tan with dark brown markings.\r\nThighs orange-yellow; labial stripe white; iris bronze\" (Duellman, field\r\nnotes, July 10, 1964.)\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--Smith (1953:150) named _cyanosticta_ as a subspecies of\r\n_Hyla phaeota_. The differences in cranial characters and certain\r\nexternal characters between _phaeota_ and _cyanosticta_ indicate that\r\nthey are distinct species. Furthermore, a gap of about 350 kilometers\r\nexists between the known geographic ranges of the two kinds.\r\n\r\n_Distribution._--_Smilisca cyanosticta_ inhabits wet forests on the\r\nAtlantic slope of southern Mexico and northern Central America from\r\nnorthern Oaxaca and southern Veracruz through northern Chiapas in Mexico\r\nand into El Peten and northern Alta Verapaz in Guatemala (Fig. 2).\r\nApparently the range is discontinuous, for in southern Mexico the\r\nspecies is found in cloud forest at elevations of 830 to 900 meters on\r\nthe northern slopes of the Sierra de Juarez. In the Sierra de Los\r\nTuxtlas in southern Veracruz the species is found in wet forest at\r\nelevations of 300 to 1200 meters, but is absent in the intervening\r\nlowlands characterized by drier forest. In the west forests of northern\r\nAlta Verapaz and El Peten, Guatemala, the species is found at low\r\nelevations.\r\n\r\n_Specimens examined._--78, as follows: MEXICO: =Chiapas=: Monte Libano,\r\nMCZ 28271-9; 8 km.

Also, specimens from\r\nHeredia Province, Costa Rica, have a relatively smaller tympanum (62.7\r\nto 80.4 [mean 68.4] per cent of the diameter of the eye, as compared\r\nwith means of 74.0 to 77.9 per cent in the other samples).\r\n\r\nTwo populations are distinctive as regards the size of adult males.\r\nSpecimens from the northern Caribbean lowlands of Nicaragua (Bonanza,\r\nthe northernmost locality for the species) are remarkably small. Males\r\nhaving snout-vent lengths of between 40 and 43 mm. were breeding; the\r\nlargest male found had a snout-vent length of 47.7 mm. The other extreme\r\nin size is attained in specimens from the Pacific lowlands of eastern\r\nCosta Rica and western Panama, where most breeding males have snout-vent\r\nlengths of more than 55 mm.; the largest male had a snout-vent length of\r\n64.9 mm.\r\n\r\nThe rather striking differences in size among certain samples and the\r\nminor differences in proportions among other samples show no geographic\r\ntrends. Instead, the variations apparently are random among the samples.\r\nThe data presented here possibly are the results of inadequate sampling,\r\nbut more likely reflect actual differences in the populations.\r\n\r\nThe dorsal ground color of _Smilisca phaeota_ is pale green to tan; the\r\nventer is creamy white. The dorsum is variously marked with dark\r\nolive-green or dark brown spots or blotches (Pl. 6C). A dark\r\ninterorbital bar is usually present. Usually a large dark dorsal mark\r\nextends from the occiput to the sacral region, but in many individuals\r\nthis blotch is replaced by two or three dark marks. The dorsal markings\r\nare irregular in shape and do not tend to form transverse bands or\r\nlongitudinal bars. The hind limbs are marked by dark transverse bands,\r\nusually four or five on the thigh, five or six on the shank, and four on\r\nthe tarsus. Two or three narrow bands are usually present on the\r\nproximal part of the fourth toe. The webbing on the feet is brown. The\r\nloreal region is pale green, bordered above by a narrow dark brown\r\ncanthal stripe extending from the nostril to the orbit. The upper lip is\r\nsilvery white. A broad dark brown or black mark extends posteriorly from\r\nthe orbit, encompassing the tympanum, to a point above the insertion of\r\nthe forelimb. The flanks are pale green or pale tan and marked with a\r\nfine dark brown or black venation. The anterior surfaces of the thighs\r\nusually are pale brown or grayish tan, sometimes having small,\r\nindistinct darker flecks. The posterior surfaces of the thighs are\r\nsimilarly colored, but in most specimens small but distinct dark flecks\r\nare present; in some specimens small cream-colored spots are also\r\npresent on the posterior surfaces of the thighs. A distinct, narrow\r\ncreamy white anal stripe usually is present. A distinct white stripe is\r\npresent on the outer edge of the tarsus and fifth toe; on the tarsus the\r\nwhite stripe is bordered below by dark brown. A white stripe also is\r\npresent on the outer edge of the forearm and fourth finger. In breeding\r\nmales the throat is dark gray.\r\n\r\nLittle geographic variation in color or pattern is evident. Few, if any,\r\nspecimens from the Pacific lowlands of South America are green in life.\r\n(We have seen no living individuals from South America.) Some living\r\nindividuals from Costa Rica and all those seen alive from Nicaragua have\r\na tint of pale blue on the flanks. In some specimens the dorsal pattern\r\nis so faint as to be barely discernible, whereas in most specimens the\r\npattern is bold.\r\n\r\nThe coloration in the living frogs is highly variable due to extreme\r\nmetachrosis. Individuals of this species are capable of changing the\r\ndorsal coloration from green to brown in a short period of time. Both\r\ngreen and brown individuals have been found active at night. Usually\r\nthose individuals found hiding by day are brown. One individual from\r\nFinca La Sumbadora, Panama (now KU 91914), was kept alive in the\r\nlaboratory for nearly one month. This individual usually was pale green\r\nwith tan dorsal markings at night and tan with pale green markings by\r\nday. On occasion the pale green dorsal markings were boldly outlined by\r\nbright dark green.\r\n\r\nIn living individuals from throughout the range of the species the iris\r\nis a bronze color, darkest medially with fine black reticulations.\r\n\r\n_Natural History._--_Smilisca phaeota_ inhabits humid lowland tropical\r\nforest and seldom ascends the foothills to more than 1,000 meters. The\r\nrather equable climatic conditions, especially more or less evenly\r\ndistributed rainfall throughout the year, permit this frog to be active\r\nmost of the year. Dunn (1931:413) reported males calling on Barro\r\nColorado Island, Panama, in February and in July, and Breder (1946:416)\r\nnoted calling individuals in the Chucanaque drainage of Darien, Panama\r\nin January, March, July, August and October and in Costa Rica in April\r\nthrough August inclusively. Calling males were found at Bonanza,\r\nNicaragua in March and in July.\r\n\r\nAt all times of year the usual daytime retreats for these frogs are near\r\nwater; the frogs have been found in elephant ear plants (_Xanthosoma_)\r\nand in bromeliads; occasional individuals have been found sitting on\r\nshaded branches of bushes and trees. None has been observed on the\r\nground or beneath ground-cover by day.\r\n\r\nThe length of the breeding season cannot be determined definitely. The\r\nearliest date on which eggs have been found is May 23; Gaige, Hartweg,\r\nand Stuart (1937:5) reported a gravid female taken at El Recreo,\r\nNicaragua, in September, and we have a gravid female taken at Almirante,\r\nPanama, in March.\r\n\r\nMales usually call from secluded spots at the edge of water. All calling\r\nmales that we observed were on the ground within a few centimeters of\r\nthe water. The males usually are hidden beneath an overhanging leaf or\r\nsome other cover; they definitely do not sit in the open like _Smilisca\r\nbaudini_. Most calling males and clasping pairs have been found at the\r\nedges of small pools or shallow ditches, although occasional individuals\r\nare found at the edges of large ponds or streams.\r\n\r\nThe breeding call consists of one or two moderately short, low-pitched\r\nnotes (duration 0.33 to 0.42 seconds), repeated at intervals of about 20\r\nseconds to several minutes. Each note is a low, vibrant \"wauk,\" having\r\n100 to 130 pulses per second and a dominant frequency of 330 to 420\r\ncycles per second (Pl. 10C).\r\n\r\nThe eggs are deposited in loose clumps amidst vegetation in the water.\r\nHatchling tadpoles have total lengths of 8.7 to 10.6 mm., and body\r\nlengths of 4.1 to 4.5 mm. The external gills are long and filamentous,\r\nand the yolk sac is large. The head and caudal musculature are dark\r\nbrownish black, and the caudal fins are gray. The oral discs are large\r\nand roughly circular. The growth and development of the tadpoles are\r\nsummarized in table 11 and figure 16.\r\n\r\nA typical tadpole in stage 30 of development (KU 68482 from the Rio\r\nChitaria, Cartago Province, Costa Rica) may be described as follows:\r\nbody length 9.7 mm.; tail length 14.6 mm.; total length 24.3 mm.; body\r\nas wide as deep; snout rounded dorsally and laterally; eyes widely\r\nseparated, directed dorsolaterally; nostril about midway between eye\r\nand tip of snout; mouth anteroventral; spiracle sinistral, about midway\r\non length of body and slightly below midline; anal tube dextral; caudal\r\nmusculature slender, curved upward distally; dorsal fin extending onto\r\nbody; depth of dorsal fin slightly less than that of ventral fin at\r\nmid-length of tail; dorsal part of body pale brown; ventral surfaces\r\ntransparent with scattered pigment; pale cream-colored, crescent-shaped\r\nmark on posterior edge of body; caudal musculature pale creamy tan with\r\nscattered pale brown spots; caudal fins transparent with scattered small\r\nbrown blotches on dorsal and ventral fins; iris pale bronze in life\r\n(Fig. 13); mouth small; median part of upper lip bare; rest of mouth\r\nbordered by one row of pointed papillae; lateral fold present;\r\ntooth-rows 2/3, first upper row longest; second upper row slightly\r\nshorter, broadly interrupted medially; three lower rows complete, equal\r\nin length, slightly shorter than second upper row; upper beak moderately\r\ndeep, forming broad arch with slender lateral processes; lower beak\r\nslender, broadly V-shaped; both beaks serrate (Fig. 15E).\r\n\r\nIn tadpoles having fully developed mouthparts the tooth-row formula of\r\n2/3 is invariable. The pale crescent-shaped mark on the posterior part\r\nof the body curves anterodorsally on the dorsal surface of the body.\r\nThese marks in dorsal view give the appearance of a pair of short, pale\r\nstripes on the posterior part of the body. Most specimens from Costa\r\nRica have the pale coloration like that described above, but some\r\nindividuals (notable KU 87683 from Guapiles, Costa Rica, KU 87707 from\r\nFinca Tepeyac, Nicaragua, and KU 87708 from Bonanza, Nicaragua) have\r\nmuch more pigment. In these specimens the same color pattern obtains as\r\nin the pallid individuals, but the pigmentation is dense. This is\r\nespecially noticeable on the tail.\r\n\r\nRecently metamorphosed young have snout-vent lengths of 12.7 to 16.7 mm.\r\n(average, 14.3 mm. in eleven specimens). Coloration of young in life (KU\r\n68484 from Rio Chitaria, Cartago Province, Costa Rica): \"Dorsum pale\r\ntan; side of head and flanks darker brown, separated from tan dorsum by\r\nan indistinct cream stripe. Limbs pale yellow; thighs flecked with\r\nbrown; shank and tarsus yellowish tan with indistinct brown bars. Soles\r\nof feet brown. Belly white; throat dusty cream flecked with silvery\r\nwhite. Upper lip silvery white. Iris bright gold with black flecks.\r\nHeels, tarsal and anal stripes white\" (Duellman, field notes, May 23,\r\n1961).\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--Peters (1863:463) named _Hyla labialis_ from the \"region of\r\nBogota, Colombia\", but in 1873 regarded his new species as identical\r\nwith _Hyla phaeota_ Cope, 1862, from Turbo, Colombia. The name _Hyla\r\nlabialis_ has been used for frogs from the northern Andes in Colombia\r\n(see Dunn, 1944:72, and Stebbins and Hendrickson, 1959:522, for\r\ndiscussion of nomenclature). Rivero (1961:131) used the name _Hyla\r\nvilsoniana_ Cope, 1899, for the frogs from the northern Andes previously\r\nreferred to _Hyla labialis_. A review of the nomenclature and taxonomy\r\nof these frogs, which superficially resemble _Smilisca_ but are\r\nunrelated, is beyond the scope of the present study.\r\n\r\n_Hyla baudini dolomedes_ Barbour, 1923, is based on a small _Smilisca\r\nphaeota_ (MCZ 8539) having a snout-vent length of 45.5 mm. Dunn\r\n(1931a:413) placed _dolomedes_ in the synonymy of _Smilisca phaeota_. We\r\nhave examined the holotype of _dolomedes_ and agree with Dunn's\r\nassignment.\r\n\r\nSmith (1953:150) described _Hyla phaeota cyanosticta_ from Guatemala.\r\nOur studies on the external morphology, coloration, and especially the\r\ncranial osteology provide evidence that _cyanosticta_ is a species\r\ndistinct from _phaeota_.\r\n\r\n_Distribution._--_Smilisca phaeota_ inhabits humid tropical forests from\r\nnortheastern Nicaragua southward on the Caribbean lowlands to elevations\r\nof about 1000 meters and on the Pacific lowlands of Costa Rica,\r\nexclusive of the arid regions of Guanacaste, throughout the lowlands of\r\nPanama, exclusive of the savannas of the Pacific lowland and the Azuero\r\nPeninsula, and southward on the Pacific slopes of South America through\r\nColombia to west-central Ecuador; also the valleys of the Rio Cauca and\r\nRio Magdalena in Colombia (Fig. 2).\r\n\r\n_Specimens examined._--528, as follows: NICARAGUA: =Matagalpa=: Finca\r\nTepeyac, 10 km.

(Foregoing combination of characters distinguishing\r\n_S. puma_ from other species in genus.)\r\n\r\n_Description and variation._--Ten breeding males from the vicinity of\r\nPuerto Viejo, Heredia Province, Costa Rica, have snout-vent lengths of\r\n32.5 to 37.9 mm. (34.8 mm.). In these specimens, the length of the tibia\r\nto the snout-vent length is 0.48 to 0.53 (0.51), and the tympanum/eye\r\nratio is 0.52 to 0.72 (0.65). Seven females have snout-vent lengths of\r\n40.8 to 45.8 mm. (43.9 mm.). No individual has more than a vestige of a\r\nweb between the second and third and fourth fingers. None has a web\r\nbetween the first and second fingers. Breeding males lack nuptial\r\nexcrescences on the thumbs. The vocal sac is moderately large and\r\nbilobed.\r\n\r\nIn preserved specimens the dorsal ground color varies from yellowish tan\r\nto grayish brown. All specimens have dark brown dorsal markings in the\r\nform of a pair of dorsal stripes, variously modified (Pl. 7A). In some\r\nspecimens, such as KU 91716, the stripes are discrete and extend from\r\nthe postorbital region nearly to the vent. In most specimens the stripes\r\nare connected by a transverse mark in the scapular region and in many\r\nothers also by a transverse mark in the sacral region. In some specimens\r\nthe stripes are fragmented posteriorly; fragmentation is extreme in KU\r\n30300, in which the dorsal pattern consists of two series of dark\r\nlongitudinal dashes. The other extreme is a nearly complete fusion of\r\nthe stripes, as in KU 91714. A dark brown interorbital bar usually\r\nextends onto the eyelids, but in some specimens this is reduced to a\r\nshort V-shaped mark or small spot between the eyes. There is no dark\r\npost-tympanic mark, but dark brown pigment forms a venated pattern from\r\nthe axilla to the mid-flank; the inguinal region is white, finely\r\nmottled with dark brown. The dorsal surfaces of the hind limbs are\r\ncolored like the body and have two or three dark brown transverse marks\r\non the thighs, three to five marks on the shanks, and one or two marks\r\nor irregularly arranged dark flecks on the tarsi. The anterior and\r\nposterior surfaces of the thighs are pale tan to brown. The webbing of\r\nthe feet is tan to grayish brown. A narrow white labial stripe, white\r\nanal stripe, and narrow white stripes on the tarsi and outer edges of\r\nthe forelimbs are invariably present. The ventral surfaces are creamy\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\nIn life the dorsum is tan or pale brown with dark brown markings. Some\r\nindividuals have scattered metallic green flecks on the dorsum. The\r\nflanks are mottled dark brown and creamy white. The posterior surfaces\r\nof the thighs are dark brown. The vocal sacs are grayish brown, and the\r\niris is a deep bronze color.\r\n\r\n_Natural History._--_Smilisca puma_ inhabits humid lowland tropical\r\nforests having more or less evenly distributed rainfall throughout the\r\nyear. The equable climatic conditions seemingly permit these frogs to be\r\nactive throughout most of the year. Taylor (1952:846) found calling\r\nmales at Batan, Costa Rica, on July 20, 1951. We found the species\r\nbreeding near Puerto Viejo, Costa Rica, on February 19, June 18, July\r\n13, and July 31. Specimens of calling males from Costa Rica in the\r\ncollection at the University of Southern California were obtained in\r\nFebruary at La Fortuna, on August 22 at Los Diamantes, on August 30 at\r\nJabillos, and on September 5 at La Lola. Gravid females were collected\r\nin June, July and August.\r\n\r\nMales call from shallow water. All breeding congregations of this\r\nspecies that we have found were in a grassy marsh, 7.5 kilometers west\r\nof Puerto Viejo, Costa Rica. Tadpoles were found in water-filled\r\ndepressions in the marsh at night. When first observed, tadpoles were\r\nnear the surface of the water; they responded to light by quickly taking\r\nrefuge in the dense grass. No tadpoles were observed by day.\r\n\r\nThe breeding call consists of a low squawk, usually followed by a series\r\nof one or more rattling secondary notes (duration of primary notes,\r\n0.06-0.35 seconds; of secondary notes, 0.10 to 0.47 seconds), repeated\r\nat intervals of 5 to 55 seconds. The primary notes have 187 to 240\r\npulses per second and major frequencies of about 740 to 1870 cycles per\r\nsecond (Pl. 11A).\r\n\r\nOnly six tadpoles are available for study. Four of them in stage 34 of\r\ndevelopment have body lengths of 9.0 to 9.5 mm., tail lengths of 14.0 to\r\n15.0 mm., and total lengths of 23.0 to 24.5 mm. One tadpole in stage 38\r\nand one in stage 40 have total lengths of 31.0 mm. A typical tadpole in\r\nstage 34 of development (KU 91807 from 7.5 km. W Puerto Viejo, Heredia\r\nProvince, Costa Rica) has a body length of 9.5 mm., tail length of 15.0\r\nmm., and total length of 24.5 mm.; body about three-fourths as deep as\r\nwide; snout rounded dorsally and laterally; eyes widely separated,\r\ndirected dorsolaterally; nostril about midway between eye and tip of\r\nsnout; mouth anteroventral; spiracle sinistral, about two-thirds\r\ndistance from snout to posterior end of body and slightly below midline;\r\nanal tube dextral; caudal musculature slender, barely curved upward\r\ndistally; dorsal fin extending onto body; at mid-length of tail, depth\r\nof caudal musculature equal to that of dorsal fin and ventral fin; body\r\ngrayish brown, palest ventrally; caudal musculature pale creamy yellow\r\nwith bold gray reticulations; caudal fins transparent with gray\r\nreticulations anteriorly and black flecks posteriorly on both fins (Fig.\r\n14A). Median part of upper lip bare; rest of mouth bordered by two rows\r\nof short blunt papillae; lateral fold present; tooth-rows 2/3; upper\r\nrows equal in length; second upper row broadly interrupted medially;\r\nthree lower rows complete, first and second rows equal in length,\r\nslightly shorter than upper rows; third lower row noticeably shorter;\r\nupper beak shallow, forming broad, continuous arch with slender lateral\r\nprocesses; lower beak slender, broadly V-shaped, both beaks finely\r\nserrate (Fig. 15B).\r\n\r\nAll six tadpoles are colored alike, except that in the larger specimens\r\nscattered white flecks are present on the ventral surface of the body,\r\nand the dark reticulations continue farther posteriorly on the caudal\r\nfins than in the smaller tadpoles. In two specimens the third lower\r\ntooth-row is only about one-half the length of the other lower rows, and\r\nin one specimen the second lower tooth-row is shorter than the first.\r\nColoration of tadpoles in life: \"Body olive-brown with silvery green\r\nflecks laterally. Caudal musculature olive-brown with greenish tan\r\nflecks. Fins brown with greenish gold flecks. Iris deep bronze.\"\r\n(Duellman, field notes, February 19, 1965).\r\n\r\nOne recently metamorphosed young (KU 91808) has a snout-vent length of\r\n12.4 mm. In life this frog had a pale tan dorsum with dark brown\r\nmarkings, yellowish tan posterior surfaces of thighs, grayish brown\r\nthroat, and bronze iris.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--The identity of Cope's _Hyla puma_ has not been known. The\r\nname has appeared in various compilations, but no workers have referred\r\nany of their specimens to that species. Examination of the holotype\r\n(USNM 13735), an adult female, revealed the presence of the following\r\ncombination of characters: snout-vent length 45.8 mm., snout blunt above\r\nand rounded laterally, nostrils close to tip of snout, lips thin and\r\nflaring, a vestige of a web on the hands, feet about one-half webbed,\r\ntarsal fold weak and extending about two-thirds length of tarsus, dorsal\r\nmarkings consisting of a faded dark interorbital bar and a pair of faded\r\nlongitudinal brown marks connected by a transverse band in the scapular\r\nregion. The type agrees well with specimens of _Smilisca wellmanorum_\r\n(Taylor, 1952); the vestigial webbing on the hands and the dorsal\r\ncoloration are especially significant. Consequently, we consider _Hyla\r\nwellmanorum_ Taylor, 1952, to be a synonym of _Hyla puma_ Cope, 1885.\r\nCope gave only \"Nicaragua\" as the locality for _Hyla puma_. The specimen\r\nwas part of a collection received at the United States National Museum\r\nfrom Lt. J. F. Moser. Among the species in the collection are\r\n_Dentrobates pumilio_, _Phyllomedusa helenae_, _Corythophanes\r\ncristatus_, _Pliocercus dimidatus_, _Tretanorhinus nigroluteus_, and\r\nothers characteristically found on the Caribbean lowlands of Central\r\nAmerica. Thus, it seems reasonable to assume that the type specimen of\r\n_Hyla puma_ came from the Caribbean lowlands. Though no other Nicaraguan\r\nspecimens have been found by us, numerous specimens are known from the\r\nCaribbean lowlands of Costa Rica.\r\n\r\nCochran (1961:58), in her catalogue of type specimens in the United\r\nStates National Museum, listed _Hyla puma_ Cope, 1885, as a synonym of\r\n_Hyla molitor_ Schmidt, 1857. She made no qualifying statements. Schmidt\r\n(1858:246), in his descriptions of the species in the year following his\r\npublication of the names and Latin diagnoses, stated: \"Dorsum uniformly\r\ngray, more intensive on back, fading away laterally and on extremities;\r\nin every-day-life this blue would be called _Mueller's Blau_. A\r\ndelicately dotted black line runs on the canthus rostralis from the\r\nopening of the nose to the corner of the eye. In the armpits, on the\r\nflanks and the thighs two of our three specimens have black marblings.\"\r\n[Free translation] Certainly on the basis of coloration _Hyla puma_ is\r\ndistinctly different from _Hyla molitor_.\r\n\r\n_Distribution._--This species lives in the wet, forested regions of the\r\nCaribbean lowlands of Costa Rica and presumably southern Nicaragua (Fig.\r\n3). All specimens are from low elevations; the highest known elevation\r\nfor the occurrence of this frog is 285 meters at Laguna Bonilla.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 3.

(Foregoing combination\r\nof characters distinguishing _S. sila_ from any other species in genus.)\r\n\r\n_Description of holotype._--Snout-vent length 36.6 mm.; tibia length\r\n19.8 mm., 54.1 per cent of snout-vent length; foot length 15.5 mm., 42.3\r\nper cent of snout-vent length; head length 12.7 mm., 34.7 per cent of\r\nsnout-vent length; head width 13.3 mm., 36.8 per cent of snout-vent\r\nlength; snout short, in lateral profile truncate, only slightly rounded\r\nabove, in dorsal profile rounded; canthus rounded; loreal region\r\nnoticeably concave; lips thick, rounded, not flaring; nostrils not\r\nprotuberant, directed laterally; internarial distance 3.0 mm.;\r\ninternarial area flat; top of head flat; interorbital distance 3.5 mm.,\r\n26.3 per cent of head width; diameter of eye 4.2 mm., thrice distance\r\n(1.4 mm.) from tympanum to eye, and half again distance (2.8 mm.) from\r\norbit to nostril; pupil horizontally ovoid; width of eyelid 2.8 mm.,\r\n21.1 per cent of head width; dermal fold from posterior corner of orbit\r\ncovering upper edge of tympanum to point above insertion of forelimb;\r\ndiameter of tympanum 2.3 mm., 54.7 per cent of diameter of eye; no\r\naxillary membrane; arms moderately robust; weak fold on wrist; faintly\r\nscalloped fold along ventrolateral margin of forearm; fingers short,\r\nslender; fingers from shortest to longest, 1-2-4-3; vestige of web\r\nbetween first and second fingers; others about two-fifths webbed; discs\r\nmoderate, diameter of that on third finger about one-third diameter of\r\neye; triangular outer palmar tubercle; elliptical inner palmar tubercle\r\non base of pollex; subarticular tubercles large, conical, none bifid;\r\nsupernumerary tubercles few, large, conical; brown nuptial excrescence\r\non prepollex; heels overlap by about one-fifth length of shank when hind\r\nlimbs adpressed; tibiotarsal articulation extending to nostril; tarsal\r\nfold weak, extending nearly full length of tarsus; inner metatarsal\r\ntubercle elliptical, flat; outer metatarsal tubercle absent; toes\r\nmoderately long; toes from shortest to longest, 1-2-3-5-4, third and\r\nfifth about equal in length; discs about same size as those on fingers;\r\nwebbing extending to middle of penultimate phalanx on all toes, except\r\nonly to distal end of antepenultimate phalanx of fourth toe;\r\nsubarticular tubercles round; supernumerary tubercles large, round,\r\npresent only on proximal digits. Anal opening directed posteriorly at\r\nlevel of upper edge of thighs; no noticeable anal sheath; flat tubercles\r\nventrolateral to anal opening large; skin of chest, belly, and posterior\r\nsurfaces of thighs granular; other surfaces smooth; tongue broadly\r\ncordiform, shallowly notched posteriorly, and barely free behind;\r\nvomerine teeth 4-4, situated on ventral surfaces of separated rounded\r\nprominences between posterior margins of small, ovoid inner nares; vocal\r\nslits long, each situated along inner margin of ramus; color (in\r\npreservative) pinkish tan above with irregular olive-brown markings\r\nforming interconnected spots on back; four bars on dorsal surface of\r\neach thigh; five bars on shank, and three on tarsus; inguinal region\r\nwhite with black mottling; posterior surfaces of thighs yellowish tan\r\nproximally, dark brown distally; margins of lips grayish white with\r\nbrown markings; ventral surfaces of hands and feet grayish brown; belly\r\nand posterior part of throat creamy white; anterior part of throat\r\nbrown.\r\n\r\n_Description and variation._--Ten breeding males from Finca La\r\nSumbadora, Panama, have snout-vent lengths of 40.0 to 44.8 mm. (42.3\r\nmm.). In these specimens the tibia/snout-vent length ratio is 0.50 to\r\n0.57 (0.54), and the tympanum/eye ratio is 0.48 to 0.58 (0.53). There is\r\na geographic gradient in size; specimens from the western part of the\r\nrange (southern Costa Rica) are smaller than those from the eastern part\r\nof the range (eastern Panama). Five males from the Pacific lowlands of\r\nsouthern Costa Rica have snout-vent lengths of 31.6 to 38.2 mm. (34.7\r\nmm.); ten males from El Volcan, Chiriqui, Panama, 32.6 to 37.9 mm. (36.4\r\nmm.), and eight males from Barro Colorado Island, Canal Zone, 38.2 to\r\n42.0 mm. (35.6 mm.). These are smaller than the males from Finca La\r\nSumbadora, which is east of the Canal Zone. Ten females from El Volcan\r\nhave snout-vent lengths of 44.2 to 55.6 mm. (49.2 mm.), as compared 56.1\r\nto 62.2 mm. (58.2 mm.) in three females from Finca La Sumbadora.\r\n\r\nLarge females have scattered small tubercles on the head and back;\r\ntubercles occur in males from Costa Rica and in some males from western\r\nPanama. The truncate snout is characteristic of both sexes.\r\n\r\nThe coloration of _Smilisca sila_ consists of a gray, tan, or pale\r\nreddish brown dorsal ground color and a creamy white venter. The dorsum\r\nis marked by dark brown, olive-brown, or dark reddish brown spots or\r\nblotches (Pl. 7B). Usually the blotches are discrete, but in some\r\nindividuals they are interconnected and form an irregular dark mark on\r\nthe dorsum. There is no tendency for the blotches to form transverse\r\nbars as in _Smilisca sordida_. In one specimen (KU 80467) the blotches\r\nare fused and form two wide irregular longitudinal stripes, as in\r\n_Smilisca puma_. In some females the dorsal markings are reduced to a\r\nfew small spots or are nearly absent (KU 92332), whereas in other\r\nfemales the dorsal markings are bold. In one female (KU 91894) the\r\ndorsal markings are narrowly bordered by pale blue, and numerous pale\r\nblue flecks are present on the pale brown dorsum. In many individuals of\r\nboth sexes small white flecks are present on the dorsal surfaces.\r\n\r\nUsually the flanks and posterior surfaces of the thighs have black\r\nmottling enclosing pale blue spots and flecks, respectively. The dorsal\r\nsurfaces of the limbs are marked by dark brown transverse bars; usually\r\nthree or four bars are present on each forearm, thigh, and shank. The\r\ncoloration of the flanks and limbs varies geographically. Specimens from\r\nsouthern Costa Rica and western Panama have distinct bars on the limbs;\r\nthe posterior surfaces of the thighs have brown reticulations enclosing\r\nsmall blue flecks in specimens from Costa Rica and bolder, black\r\nreticulations enclosing large pale blue spots in specimens from western\r\nPanama. In specimens from Costa Rica the flanks are brown with pale blue\r\nflecks, whereas in those from Chiriqui, Panama, the flanks are pale blue\r\nwith dark brown mottling in the inguinal region. Frogs from El Valle and\r\nCerro la Campana usually have distinct bars on the limbs; the posterior\r\nsurfaces of the thighs are colored as in frogs from Chiriqui, and the\r\ninguinal region is pale blue with coarse brown mottling. Specimens from\r\nBarro Colorado Island are marked like those from El Valle and Cerro la\r\nCampana, except that on the posterior surfaces of the thighs fine black\r\nreticulations enclose many dark blue spots. In specimens from Darien and\r\nfrom Panama Province east of the Canal Zone (Altos de Pacora, Cerro\r\nJefe, Finca La Sumbadora, and Rio Pacora), the markings on the dorsal\r\nsurfaces of the limbs are indistinct or absent in males, but distinct in\r\nsome females. Intense brown and black pigment forms fine reticulations\r\ndelimiting bold blue spots on the flanks; this coloration extends to the\r\naxilla in many specimens. Fine black reticulations enclose many dark\r\nblue spots on the posterior surfaces of the thighs.\r\n\r\nIn females, the throat is creamy white; in some specimens scattered\r\nbrown flecks are present on the chin and throat. In breeding males the\r\nanterior part of the throat is dark gray or dark brown.\r\n\r\nThe coloration in life is as variable as it is in preservative. In life\r\nthe holotype had a tan dorsum with dark olive-green irregular markings\r\nand small green flecks. The limbs were tan with dark brown transverse\r\nbars. The flanks were grayish tan anteriorly; the inguinal region and\r\nposterior surfaces of thighs were blue with black mottling. The belly\r\nwas creamy white, and the throat was brown with creamy yellow flecks.\r\nThe iris was a dull bronze color. Among the paratypes, some individuals\r\nhad green flecks, others did not. The inguinal region and posterior\r\nsurfaces of the thighs were pale blue, pale yellowish green, or grayish\r\ntan with black mottling. The blue was most noticeable in females.\r\n\r\nColors of a male from Finca La Sumbadora, Panama, were described as\r\nfollows: \"Dorsum olive-brown; irregular dark brown blotches, pale green\r\nflecks, and raised creamy yellow spots on dorsal surfaces; belly creamy\r\nwhite; throat grayish brown; undersides of limbs grayish tan; groin,\r\nanterior and posterior surface of thigh, inner surface of shank,\r\nanterior edge of tarsus, and proximal parts of third and fourth toes\r\npale blue marbled with dark brown and black; webbing brown; iris pale\r\nbronze, finely reticulated with black.\" (Duellman, field notes, January\r\n28, 1964.)\r\n\r\nA female (now KU 91894) from Altos de Pacora, Panama, was described as\r\nfollows: \"An irregular dark brown, green-bordered figure on head and\r\nback; dark brown, green-bordered bands on limbs--all on a lighter brown\r\nand heavily green-spotted background. These markings are more vivid at\r\nnight than during the day. Lower sides, from midbody onto front of\r\nthighs and rear of thighs onto venter of shanks to heels and thence\r\ndorsally onto basal portions of toes heavily blue spotted on a light\r\nbrown (front of thighs and venter of shanks) to blackish brown\r\nbackground. Venter cream. Iris gray-brown, finely veined with dark\r\nbrown.\" (Charles W. Myers, field notes, December 14, 1964.) Note that in\r\nthe earlier discussion of coloration of preserved specimens, the green\r\nspots and borders have changed to pale blue after six months in\r\nalcohol.\r\n\r\nIn living individuals from Costa Rica and Panama west of the Canal Zone,\r\nthe blue coloration on the flanks and thighs is much less conspicuous\r\nthan in specimens from eastern Panama. The color of the iris is\r\nvariable, even in frogs from one locality. The coloration of the iris in\r\n13 living frogs (now KU 92333-45) from Valle Hornito, Chiriqui, Panama,\r\nwas described as follows: \"Iris variable--from pale to dark brown; in a\r\nfew the iris has a golden cast to the brown; in a few others the lower\r\nhalf of the iris is pale gray with the upper half being light brown.\"\r\n(Charles W. Myers, field notes, April 24, 1965).\r\n\r\n_Natural history._--_Smilisca sila_ inhabits the Pacific slopes of lower\r\nCentral America where a pronounced dry season occurs. We have records of\r\nmales calling in December through May and also in August (latter date\r\nfrom El Volcan, Chiriqui, Panama). The breeding season seems to be\r\ncorrelated with the time of the year when the water is clear and at a\r\nlow level in the streams where these frogs breed.\r\n\r\nMales call from the edges of small, shallow streams, from rocks in the\r\nstreams, or less frequently from vegetation overhanging the streams.\r\nFemales are most frequently found on the banks of streams, and clasping\r\npairs usually are in shallow pools in streams. One individual was found\r\nin a bromeliad about three meters above the ground in the daytime.\r\n\r\nThe breeding call consists of a low squawk, usually followed by a series\r\nof one or more rattling secondary notes (duration of primary notes, 0.06\r\nto 0.28 seconds; of secondary notes, 0.14 to 0.48 seconds), repeated at\r\nintervals of 4 to 20 seconds. The primary notes have 97 to 120 pulses\r\nper second and major frequencies of about 900 to 2220 cycles per second\r\n(Pl. 11B).\r\n\r\nEggs were obtained artificially in the field; the average length of ten\r\nembryos in the neural groove stage is 2.4 mm., and the average diameter\r\nof the outer envelope is 4.9 mm. Hatchlings have large, conical oral\r\ndiscs, heavy gills, and a large amount of yolk; their average total\r\nlength is 6.3 mm.\r\n\r\nTadpoles have been found in pools in clear streams; some tadpoles have\r\nbeen observed to cling by their mouths to rocks in the stream; others\r\nwere found on the bottom where they seek refuge among pebbles or under\r\nrocks and leaves. A complete developmental series of tadpoles is not\r\navailable. Eleven tadpoles in stage 25 of development have body lengths\r\nof 8.3 to 10.2 mm. (9.3 mm.), tail lengths of 17.3 to 21.0 mm. (18.8\r\nmm.), and total lengths of 25.9 to 31.0 mm. (28.1 mm.). One tadpole in\r\nstage 41 and one in stage 42 have body lengths of 11.5 and 12.5 mm.,\r\ntail lengths of 27.2 and 29.5 mm., and total lengths of 38.7 and 42.0\r\nmm., respectively. The snout-vent lengths of two specimens in stage 43\r\nand one in stage 45 are 12.7, 13.0, and 13.6 mm., respectively.\r\n\r\nA typical tadpole in stage 25 of development (KU 80620 from Finca La\r\nSumbadora, Panama) has a body length of 9.5 mm., tail length of 19.0\r\nmm., and a total length of 28.5 mm.; body only slightly wider than deep,\r\nnearly flat dorsally; snout broadly rounded in dorsal view, bluntly\r\nrounded in lateral view; eyes widely separated, directed dorsolaterally;\r\nnostril slightly closer to eye than to tip of snout; mouth ventral;\r\nspiracle sinistral, located about two-thirds distance from snout to\r\nposterior edge of body; anal tube dextral; caudal musculature moderately\r\nheavy, straight; dorsal fin not extending onto body; fins deepest at\r\nabout two-fifths length of tail, where depth of caudal musculature about\r\nequal to depth of dorsal and depth of ventral fin; musculature\r\nextending nearly to tip of tail; body dark grayish brown above and pale\r\ngrayish tan below with small dark brown spots dorsally and white flecks\r\nlaterally; caudal musculature pale tan with dark brown flecks over\r\nentire surface and dark brown streaks on posterior one-half of ventral\r\nfin and on all of dorsal fin (Fig. 14B). Median one-third of upper lip\r\nbare; rest of mouth bordered by a single row of conical papillae;\r\nlateral fold present; tooth rows 2/3; upper rows cone-shaped, about\r\nequal in length, broadly /\\-shaped; second upper row narrowly\r\ninterrupted medially; lower rows complete, about equal in length, but\r\nslightly shorter than upper rows; upper beak moderately massive, its\r\ninner surface forming a continuous arch with short lateral processes;\r\nlower beak broadly \\/-shaped; both beaks finely serrate (Fig. 15D).\r\n\r\nTadpoles from El Volcan, Chiriqui (KU 91833), are more heavily pigmented\r\nthan those from Finca La Sombadora; the spots on the tail are larger. In\r\nlife these tadpoles had dark brownish black bodies with golden and green\r\nlichenous flecks; the tail was tan with dark brown markings, and the\r\niris was a grayish bronze color. In life tadpoles from Finca La\r\nSumbadora were olive-tan above and dark gray with pale bluish gray\r\nirridescent spots ventrally. The caudal musculature was creamy tan with\r\nbrown flecks and streaks, and the iris was pale bronze.\r\n\r\nMetamorphosing young have been found on vegetation at the edge of\r\nstreams and have been raised in the laboratory. Seven recently\r\nmetamorphosed young have snout-vent lengths of 13.6 to 15.6 mm. (14.6\r\nmm.). A living juvenile (KU 91913) raised in the laboratory from a\r\ntadpole obtained at Finca La Sumbadora had a brown dorsum with darker\r\nbrown markings, a white spot below the eye, and a narrow white labial\r\nstripe. The belly was white; the flanks were brown with white spots, and\r\nthe posterior surfaces of the thighs were yellowish tan. The iris was a\r\ngolden bronze color with much black reticulation.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--This species has been confused with _Smilisca sordida_; most\r\nauthors have referred both species to _Hyla (Smilisca) gabbi_.\r\nExamination of the types of _Hyla sordida_, _gabbi_, _salvini_, and\r\n_nigripes_ revealed that all of the names were referable to a single\r\nspecies (_S. sordida_), and that the small, blunt-snouted species in\r\nPanama and southern Costa Rica probably was without a name. Possibly\r\n_Hyla molitor_ Schmidt (1857) is based on the species that we have named\r\n_S. sila_, but several discrepancies in his description, plus the\r\nunknown provenance of the type, have led us to discount the\r\napplicability of that name to the species under consideration.\r\n\r\n_Distribution._--_Smilisca sila_ ranges along the Pacific slopes and\r\nlowlands of southern Costa Rica and Panama at elevations from sea level\r\nto about 1300 meters; in northern South America the species occurs in\r\nthe Caribbean lowlands and in the valleys of the northward draining\r\nrivers of Colombia (Fig. 3).\r\n\r\n_Specimens examined_, 234, as follows: COSTA RICA: =Puntarenas=: 6 km.

(Foregoing combination of characters\r\ndistinguishing _S. sordida_ from any other species in genus.)\r\n\r\n_Description and variation._--Ten breeding males from 15 to 20\r\nkilometers west-southwest of San Isidro el General, San Jose, Costa\r\nRica, have snout-vent lengths of 38.1 to 42.6 mm. (40.5 mm.). In these\r\nspecimens, the tibia/snout-vent length ratio is 0.50 to 0.54 (0.52), and\r\nthe tympanum/eye ratio is 0.45 to 0.57 (0.49). Specimens from the\r\nPacific slopes of Costa Rica are larger than those from the Meseta\r\nCentral and the Caribbean lowlands. Ten males from 6 kilometers east of\r\nGolfito, Puntarenas, have snout-vent lengths of 38.4 to 44.6 mm. (41.8\r\nmm.), and five males from Rincon, Peninsula de Osa, have snout-vent\r\nlengths of 38.8 to 41.6 mm. (40.3 mm.). Snout-vent lengths of ten males\r\nfrom La Fortuna, Alajuela, are 31.9 to 36.0 mm. (34.4 mm.), of ten males\r\nfrom Pandora, Limon, 33.8 to 37.6 mm. (35.9 mm.), and of ten males from\r\nEscazu and Rio Jorco on the Meseta Central, 34.3 to 37.6 mm. (36.0 mm.).\r\nEight females from the Rio Jorco on the Meseta Central have snout-vent\r\nlengths of 48.8 to 53.8 mm. (50.4 mm.), and six females from various\r\nlocalities on the Pacific slopes of Costa Rica have snout-vent lengths\r\nof 56.5 to 64.0 mm. (59.8 mm.). The only noticeable differences in\r\nproportions between males and females is in the tympanum/eye ratio; for\r\nexample, this ratio is 0.47 to 0.53 (0.49) and 0.54 to 0.68 (0.61) in\r\nten males and eight females, respectively, from the Meseta Central.\r\n\r\nThe shape of the snout and the associated cranial elements of _S.\r\nsordida_ vary geographically and ontogenetically. Specimens from the\r\nCaribbean lowlands have blunt snouts in lateral view; those from the\r\nPacific lowlands have longer, more slender snouts that are pointed in\r\nlateral view, and those from the Meseta Central are intermediate in\r\nsnout shape between the two lowland populations (Fig. 4). These\r\ndifferences in shape of the snout are dependent on the nature of the\r\nunderlying cranial bones, principally the maxillaries and nasals. In\r\nspecimens from the Caribbean lowlands the nasals are long, wide, and\r\nnarrowly separated from the ethmoid; the anterior edge is just posterior\r\nto the nostril. The maxillary flanges are nearly vertical. In specimens\r\nfrom the Pacific lowlands the nasals are relatively shorter, narrower,\r\nand rather widely separated from the ethmoid; the anterior edges of the\r\nnasals do not extend so far forward as in specimens from the Caribbean\r\nlowlands. The maxillary flanges slant medially. In these cranial\r\ncharacters, specimens from the Meseta Central are intermediate between\r\nthe two lowland populations.\r\n\r\nSuperimposed on this geographic variation are ontogenetic changes, which\r\nare most noticeable in males. In smaller, and presumably younger,\r\nspecimens the snouts are more pointed than in larger specimens;\r\nconsequently some small males from the Caribbean lowlands resemble\r\nlarger males from the Pacific lowlands, since the nasals and maxillaries\r\nof the former are not fully ossified. In addition, in small breeding\r\nmales the ethmoid is only about one-half ossified, a large\r\nfrontoparietal foramen is present, the anterior arm of the squamosal\r\nextends only about one-fourth the distance to the maxillary (two-thirds\r\nthe distance in larger specimens), and the tegmen tympani are short, as\r\ncompared with the long, thin elements in larger specimens.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 4.

The dorsum is variously marked with\r\ndark gray, dark brown, reddish brown, or olive-green spots or blotches\r\n(Pl. 7C). A dark interorbital bar usually is present. The dorsal\r\nmarkings on the body usually consist of a blotch, or two or more spots,\r\non the occiput, in the scapular region, and in the sacral region. In\r\nmany specimens, especially females, these markings are in the form of\r\nbroad transverse bars. A female (USC 7164) from Las Canas, Guanacaste,\r\nCosta Rica, has a tan dorsum with many black flecks and round brown\r\nspots bordered by darker brown. One female (KU 91763) from the Rio\r\nJorco, San Jose, Costa Rica, has a unicolor tan dorsum. Some individuals\r\nhave scattered, small white spots on the dorsum; these are most evident\r\nin a male (USC 7153) from La Fortuna, Alajuela. White labial stripes and\r\nanal stripes are absent in all specimens.\r\n\r\nThe limbs are marked by dark brown transverse bars; these are indistinct\r\nin some specimens from the Meseta Central and Caribbean lowlands,\r\nwhereas they are distinct in all specimens from the Pacific lowlands.\r\nSpecimens from the Caribbean lowlands have two to six bars on each\r\nshank, whereas specimens from the Pacific slopes have four to six bars\r\non each shank, and specimens from the Meseta Central have as many as\r\neight bars on each shank. A narrow, sometimes broken white line is\r\npresent on the ventrolateral edge of the forearm. The webbing on the\r\nhand is tan or pale gray, and the ventral surfaces of the tarsi and the\r\nwebbing on the feet are dark gray or brown. Breeding males have dark\r\nbrown nuptial excrescences on the prepollex.\r\n\r\nThe flanks and posterior surfaces of the thighs usually are marked by\r\nbluish white and creamy tan flecks, respectively, but vary considerably.\r\nIn specimens from the Caribbean lowlands a small amount of flecking is\r\npresent in the inguinal region, and on the posterior surfaces of the\r\nthighs flecks are few or absent. In specimens from the Meseta Central,\r\nnumerous large flecks or small, round spots (pale bluish white in life)\r\nare on the posterior half of the flanks; small flecks are on the\r\nposterior surfaces of the thighs. Specimens from the Pacific slopes and\r\nlowlands of southern Costa Rica (Puntarenas and San Jose Provinces) have\r\nbold mottling of black and bluish white on the flanks and many bluish\r\nwhite flecks on the posterior surfaces of the thighs. The flanks are\r\nreticulated from the axilla to the groin in two females (UMMZ 123684 and\r\nUSC 7236) from Rincon, Peninsula de Osa. In specimens from the Pacific\r\nslopes of Guanacaste in northwestern Costa Rica, flecks are present in\r\nthe inguinal region; indistinct flecks are on the posterior surfaces of\r\nthe thighs.\r\n\r\nThe throat is immaculate in specimens from the Caribbean lowlands in\r\nLimon Province; the throats are dusky laterally in most other specimens\r\nexcept some from the Meseta Central, in which the throats are heavily\r\nflecked with black. This variation occurs in males and females.\r\n\r\nThe color and pattern in life are highly variable. A composite\r\ndescription of living individuals (now KU 91718-41) from 6 kilometers\r\neast of Golfito, Puntarenas, Costa Rica, illustrates the variability:\r\n\"Dorsum pale olive-green, fading to tan posteriorly, or tan all over\r\nwith dark olive-green or dark brown spots on back and bars on limbs.\r\nFlanks dark brown with cream, greenish gray, or bluish gray mottling.\r\nPosterior surfaces of thighs dark brown with pale blue, pale green, or\r\ntan flecks. Iris creamy silver. Throats white with some brown flecks\r\nperipherally.\" (Duellman, Field notes, February 15, 1965.) A male from\r\nthe Rio Jorco, San Jose, Costa Rica, was dull olive-tan above with\r\nolive-green marks; the flanks were brown with pale tan flecks, and the\r\nposterior surfaces of the thighs were pale brown with cream-colored\r\nflecks. Six females from the same locality were reddish brown above with\r\nolive-brown or dark brown markings; one was uniform orange-tan, and\r\nanother was dull olive-green with darker markings.\r\n\r\nThe color of the iris in living frogs varies from creamy silver to\r\ngrayish yellow or bronze with a variable amount of black reticulation.\r\n\r\n_Natural History._--_Smilisca sordida_ is not associated with any one\r\ntype of vegetation; instead it lives in the vicinity of rocky streams\r\nhaving low gradients. Breeding takes place primarily in the dry season,\r\nwhen the water in the streams is clear and at a low level. Through most\r\nof the range of _S. sordida_ showers, or even short heavy rains, occur\r\nin the dry season. After such rains the breeding activity is maximal.\r\nBreeding congregations have been found from December through April, but\r\na few calling males and gravid females have been taken in June, July,\r\nand August. In the rainy season non-breeding individuals are found\r\nsitting on bushes near streams at night. Taylor (1952:843) found\r\nspecimens in bromeliads by day.\r\n\r\nMales usually call from rocks or gravel bars in, or at the edge of,\r\nstreams. Some individuals perch in low bushes overhanging the streams,\r\nand some sit in shallows in the streams. Clasping pairs have been found\r\non the banks of streams and in shallow water in streams.\r\n\r\nThe breeding call consists of one to six moderately short, rather\r\nhigh-pitched notes (duration 0.18 to 0.45 seconds) repeated at intervals\r\nof 12 seconds to several minutes. Each note is a vibrant rattle having\r\n78 to 135 pulses per second and major frequences of about 1200 to 2600\r\ncycles per second (Pl. 11C).\r\n\r\nThe tadpoles live in shallow parts of the streams, where they cling to\r\nthe surfaces of small rocks and hide beneath leaves and rocks. A\r\ncomplete developmental series of tadpoles is not available; measurements\r\nof those stages examined are summarized in Table 12.\r\n\r\nA typical tadpole in stage 36 of development (KU 68475 from 15 km. WSW\r\nof San Isidro el General, Costa Rica) has a body length of 11.7 mm.,\r\ntail length of 22.8 mm., and a total length of 34.5 mm.; body about\r\nthree-fourths as deep as wide; snout broadly rounded in dorsal view,\r\nsloping and rounded in lateral view; eyes widely separated, directed\r\ndorsolaterally; nostril slightly closer to eye than to tip of snout;\r\nmouth ventral; spiracle sinistral, about two-thirds distance from snout\r\nto posterior end of body and slightly below midline; anal tube dextral;\r\ncaudal musculature heavy, straight; dorsal fin not extending onto body;\r\nfins deepest at about mid-length of tail; there depth of caudal\r\nmusculature equal to depth of dorsal fin and half again as deep as\r\nventral fin; musculature extending nearly to tip of tail; body reddish\r\nbrown above and pale grayish brown with white flecks below; caudal\r\nmusculature pale tan with brown flecks; a series of reddish brown dashes\r\nat base of caudal fin separated from others in series and from dashes on\r\nother side by creamy white; fins transparent with reddish brown flecks\r\non posterior one-half of ventral fin and on all of dorsal fin (Fig.\r\n14C). Mouth bordered by two rows of short, pointed papillae; lateral\r\nfold present; tooth-rows 2/3; upper rows equal in length; second upper\r\nrow narrowly interrupted medially; three lower rows complete, nearly as\r\nlong as upper rows, deeply indented medially; upper beak robust, inner\r\nsurface not forming continuous arch with short lateral processes; lower\r\nbeak deep, V-shaped; both beaks bearing short serrations (Fig. 15F).\r\n\r\nLittle variation occurs in structure. In some specimens the second upper\r\ntooth-row is complete; no individuals were found to have the row broadly\r\ninterrupted medially.\r\n\r\nThe series of dark dashes on the dorsal edge of the caudal musculature\r\nis diagnostic of all stages studied. In life, tadpoles from 15 and 20\r\nkilometers west-southwest of San Isidro el General, Costa Rica, had a\r\ntan body, often with an olive-tan tinge; the caudal musculature was\r\ntan; the flecks and dashes were dull red or reddish brown. Tadpoles from\r\n6 kilometers east of Golfito, Costa Rica, had bodies with olive-green\r\nflecks. The caudal musculature was brown with bluish green flecks; the\r\nfins were transparent with reddish brown flecks. The belly was a silvery\r\ngolden color. Tadpoles from Bajos de Jorco, Costa Rica, had brown bodies\r\nwith bluish green flecks; the tail and fins had reddish brown flecks and\r\ndashes. The iris was a bronze color in specimens from all three\r\nlocalities, as well as in the young mentioned in the following\r\nparagraph.\r\n\r\nNine recently metamorphosed young were found on vegetation at the edges\r\nof streams in April. These specimens have snout-vent lengths of 13.1 to\r\n15.7 mm. (14.9 mm.) and in life were pale greenish tan or olive-tan\r\nabove and white below. The hands, feet, and thighs were pale yellowish\r\ntan.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--The foregoing synonymies indicate that confusion has existed\r\nin the application of various names, to this species, as well as in use\r\nof the names _sordida_ and _gabbi_ to include the species that we\r\ndescribe and name _Smilisca sila_. Correct allocation of the names\r\ninvolved was possible only after studying and comparing the type\r\nspecimens, for the descriptions given by the various authors are not\r\nsufficiently explicit to determine the nature of many essential\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\nThe presence of a rounded snout and a long white throat in males\r\ndistinguishes _S. sordida_ from _S. sila_, which has a high truncate\r\nsnout and short dark throat in males. The two syntypes of _Hyla sordida_\r\nPeters, 1863, (ZMB 3141) are males having snout-vent lengths of 36.9 and\r\n37.0 mm. The two syntypes of _Hyla gabbi_ Cope, 1876 (USNM 30658-9), are\r\nfemales having snout-vent lengths of 52.8 and 53.7 mm., respectively.\r\nAlso included in the collections made by Gabb is eastern Costa Rica are\r\ntwo males (USNM 30685-6), which Cope (1876) named and described as _Hyla\r\nnigripes_. These specimens are soft and faded, but are recognizable as\r\nthe same as _Hyla sordida_ Peters; the syntypes of _Hyla nigripes_ have\r\nsnout-vent lengths of 37.6 and 37.7 mm. We have examined one of the\r\nsyntypes of _Hyla salvini_ Boulenger, 1882 (BMNH 1947.2.24.13), a female\r\nhaving a snout-vent length of 54.6 mm. We are convinced that all of\r\nthese type specimens are representatives of one species, the earliest\r\nname for which is _Hyla sordida_ Peters, 1863. The type localities for\r\nthree of the named species are in Costa Rica--_H. gabbi_ from Sipurio on\r\nthe Caribbean lowlands, _H. nigripes_ from the Caribbean slopes of Pico\r\nBlanco, and _H. salvini_ from Cartago on the Meseta Central. The type\r\nlocality of _H. sordida_ was given as \"Veraguas\" by Peters (1863). At\r\nthat time Veraguas was often considered to be most of western Panama.\r\nThough we have not seen Panamanian specimens other than the types of _S.\r\nsordida_ and one specimen from the Pacific lowlands of western Panama,\r\nthe species probably occurs on the Caribbean slopes of western Panama.\r\nThe species has been taken on the Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rica\r\nwithin a few kilometers of Panama; collecting on the Caribbean slopes in\r\nthe provinces of Bocas del Toro and Veraguas should reveal the presence\r\nof _Smilisca sordida_ there.\r\n\r\n_Distribution._--_Smilisca sordida_ is found along the Pacific slopes\r\nand lowlands from Guanacaste, Costa Rica, southeastward to extreme\r\nwestern Panama, to elevations of about 1200 meters on the Meseta Central\r\nin Costa Rica, and on the Caribbean slopes and lowlands of Costa Rica\r\nand probably adjacent Panama (Fig. 5). One specimen purportedly comes\r\nfrom \"Rio Grande, Nicaragua.\"\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 5.

Recent reviews by Brattstrom (1957)\r\nand Hecht (1962, 1963) have been concerned with general salientian\r\nclassification and phylogeny, principally at the family level. Savage\r\nand Carvalho (1953), Griffiths (1959), and Baldauf (1959) used\r\nosteological characters in determining the taxonomic status of the\r\nfamilies Pseudidae, Brachycephalidae, and Bufonidae, respectively.\r\nCarvalho (1954) presented osteological evidence for the generic\r\nseparation of New World microhylids. Zweifel (1956) and Tihen (1962)\r\nused osteological characters at the levels of the species-group and\r\nspecies in their respective studies on _Scaphiopus_ and _Bufo_. Little\r\nhas been recorded about the skeletons of the hylids. Goin (1961)\r\nmentioned dentigerous elements and cranial co-ossification in his\r\nsynopsis of the genera of hylids. Copland (1957) in his review of\r\nthe _Hyla_ of Australia, Funkhouser (1957) in her revision of\r\n_Phyllomedusa_, and Zweifel (1958) in his review of _Nyctimystes_ did\r\nnot consider skeletal characters.\r\n\r\nSome osteological studies on hylids have yielded worthwhile information.\r\nMittleman and List (1953) used osteological characters in defining the\r\ngenus _Limnaoedus_: Starrett (1960) used cranial characters in\r\ncombination with jaw musculature in defining the genus _Smilisca_, and\r\nDuellman (1964) used cranial characters in delimiting the _Hyla\r\nbistincta_ group. Brief descriptions of cranial structure were given for\r\n_Phrynohyas_ (Duellman, 1956) and _Ptychohyla_ (Duellman, 1963a);\r\nspecific and sexual differences in the skulls of _Hyla chaneque_ and\r\n_Hyla taeniopus_ were pointed out by Duellman (1965). Stokely and List\r\n(1954) described early cranial development in the hylid _Pseudacris\r\ntriseriata triseriata_.\r\n\r\nBecause our knowledge of the skeleton in hylids is so incomplete, we are\r\nnot attempting to place _Smilisca_ in the general scheme of hylid\r\nphylogeny on the basis of skeletal characters. Instead, our purposes are\r\nto describe the skeleton and its ontogenetic development in one member\r\nof the genus (_S. baudini_), and to make comparisons that show taxonomic\r\ndifferences in osteological characters among species of _Smilisca_.\r\n\r\nThe study of 68 dried skeletons and 25 cleared and stained preparations,\r\nincluding an ontogenetic series of _S. baudini_, has resulted in an\r\nunderstanding of the progressive development of skeletal elements and a\r\nknowledge of interspecific and intraspecific variation in these\r\nelements. Furthermore, investigations of the osteology have provided\r\ncorrelations between some cranial characters and certain aspects of\r\nexternal morphology.\r\n\r\n_Descriptive Osteology of Smilisca baudini_\r\n\r\nThe following description is based primarily on an adult female (KU\r\n68184):\r\n\r\n_Skull._--The skull is large, solid, and broader than long; the greatest\r\nwidth is between the sutures of quadratojugal and maxillary on either\r\nside of the skull (Pls. 2-3). The maxillaries bear well-developed dorsal\r\nflanges, curve gently, join the moderately convex premaxillaries\r\nanteriorly and form a slightly truncate snout. The combined premaxillary\r\nwidth is about one-fourth the width of the skull. The premaxillaries are\r\nseparated medially, and laterally from the maxillaries by sutures. Each\r\npremaxillary bears a dorsomedial alary process, which is anteriorly\r\nconvex and four times as high as the depth of the lateral wing of\r\npremaxillary; each premaxillary also has a ventromedial palatine process\r\nthat projects dorsally from the lingual edge of the premaxillary. The\r\nseptomaxillaries are closely associated dorsally with the premaxillaries\r\nimmediately lateral to the prenasal processes.\r\n\r\nThe nasals are large, widest anteriorly and narrowing posteriorly,\r\nparallel to maxillaries, and not separated from the ethmoid by\r\ncartilage. The nasals bear long, delicate maxillary processes extending\r\nnearly to the maxillaries. Anteriorly, the nasals are widely separated\r\nby the partially ossified internasal septum, which is in contact with\r\nthe premaxillaries between the prenasal processes; the anterior points\r\nof the nasals lie approximately one-half the distance between the\r\nanterior ends of the ethmoid and the premaxillaries. The ethmoid is\r\nlarge and completely ossified; the margins are smooth. The trunate\r\nanterior edge lies between the nasals and is in contact with the\r\ninternasal septum. The frontoparietals are large, smooth-margined, and\r\nbear large supraorbital flanges curving posterolaterally at the rear of\r\nthe orbit. A small, oval foramen involves the posterior part of the\r\nethmoid and anterior portion of frontoparietals; continued ossification\r\nin older specimens fills in the foramen, thereby resulting in a solidly\r\nroofed cranium. The auditory regions are relatively massive and bear\r\nnarrow tegmen tympani; the distal ends of the tegmen tympani are medial\r\nto the lateral edge of the pterygoids in dorsal view. The squamosals are\r\nlarge; the long anterior arm is separated from the maxillary by a\r\nsuture. The delicate, spindle-shaped columellae lie ventral to the\r\ntegmen tympani and squamosals, are spatulate distally, and have a broad\r\nbasal attachment to the auditory region.\r\n\r\nThe vomers are moderately large and are in contact anteriorly with the\r\npremaxillaries and posteriorly with the ethmoid. Each vomer has two wide\r\nserrated flanges laterally. The tooth-bearing parts of the vomers are\r\nwidely separated and at a slight angle to one another; the vomers\r\nterminate medially in two pointed processes on the ethmoid. The\r\npalatines are edentate, but bear strong ridges throughout their lengths.\r\nThey are broadly in contact with the maxillary, are narrow medially, and\r\nare attached by pointed processes to the medial part of the ethmoid.\r\nThe pterygoids are large, attached to the maxillaries immediately\r\nanterior and medial to the squamosal-maxillary connection, bear\r\nwell-developed pedicles, which are broadly attached to the prooetic, and\r\na wide wing is in contact posteriorly with the distal two-thirds of the\r\nquadrate.\r\n\r\nThe angular makes up most of the lower jaw, bears a broad articular\r\nsurface posteriorly, and has a small coronoid process on the lingual\r\nedge; anteriorly the angular is separated from the dentary and\r\nmentomecklian by Meckel's cartilage. The dentary lies external to the\r\nangular and extends from the mentomecklian to approximately the\r\nmid-length of the angular. The mentomecklians are ossified, but\r\nseparated by cartilage medially.\r\n\r\n_Hyoid._--The hyoid plate is curved, thin, and mostly cartilaginous, but\r\ncalcined posteriorly (Fig. 6). The anterior cornua are slender,\r\ncartilaginous, and curve anteromedially from the hyoid plate and thence\r\nlaterally and posteriorly, to attach to the posterior surface of the\r\nprooetics. The lateral cornua are broad, flat, cartilaginous lateral\r\nextensions from the bases of the anterior cornua. The posterior cornua\r\nare bony, except distally.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 6.

KU 64220, x5.]\r\n\r\n_Vertebral Column._--The atlas lacks transverse processes and a neural\r\ncrest, whereas transverse processes are present on the other seven\r\npresacral vertebrae, and knoblike neural crests are present on the\r\nsecond, third, and fourth vertebrae; a faint neural ridge is visible on\r\nthe fifth vertebra. The transverse processes are directed laterally on\r\nthe second and sixth vertebrae, ventrolaterally on the third,\r\nposterolaterally on the fourth and fifth, and anterolaterally on the\r\nseventh and eighth. The processes are slightly expanded on the fourth,\r\nand more so on the fifth, vertebra. The sacral diapophyses are expanded\r\nand have a border of calcified cartilage laterally. There are two sacral\r\ncondyles. The slender coccyx has a thin dorsal ridge on the anterior\r\nthree-fourths of its length.\r\n\r\n_Pectoral Girdle._--The omosternum is large, ovoid, and cartilaginous;\r\nthe sternum is a thin cartilaginous sheet deeply notched posteriorly and\r\nis not differentiated into episternal and xiphisternal elements. The\r\ncoracoids are robust, twice as stout as the clavicles. The epicoracoidal\r\ncartilages overlap in the usual arciferal manner, except that they are\r\nfused anteriorly between the slender clavicles. The clavicles are\r\nstrongly arched. The clavicle, coracoid, and scapula on each side form a\r\nbony articulation at the glenoid fossa. A bifurcation of the ventral end\r\nof the scapula results in a large glenoid foramen. The scapula is flat\r\nand expanded dorsally; the suprascapula is broad, flat, and calcified in\r\nlarge adults. In young specimens no distinct ossification of the\r\ncleithrum or ossification of endochondral centers are evident.\r\n\r\n_Arm and Hand._--The humerus is equally well-developed in both sexes and\r\nhas a prominent lateral crest. The radius and ulna are completely fused.\r\nA bony prepollex is present in both sexes. The metacarpals are about\r\nequal in length. The phalangeal formula is 2-2-3-3; the terminal\r\nphalanges are claw-shaped.\r\n\r\n_Pelvic Girdle._--The ilia are long, slender, and slightly curved. A\r\nthin ridge projects laterally from the dorsal edge of the posterior\r\none-half of each ilium. The ilial prominence is large and knoblike when\r\nviewed from above. The anterior edge of the ilial prominence is at the\r\nlevel of the anterior edge of the acetabular border. The dorsal\r\nacetabular expansion is small. The pubis is slender, and the ischium is\r\nelevated and robust.\r\n\r\n_Leg and Foot._--The slightly curved femur has a distinct crest\r\nproximally on the posterior surface. The nearly straight tibio-fibula is\r\nslightly longer than the femur. The tibial and fibial elements are\r\ncompletely fused but have a distinct cleft between them. A small foramen\r\nexists at the mid-length of the tibio-fibula. The fibulare (calcaneum)\r\nis much more robust than the tibiale (astragalus). The prehallux is\r\nlarge and flat. The metatarsals of the third, fourth, and fifth digits\r\nare equal in length; the metatarsal of the second is somewhat shorter,\r\nand that of the first is much shorter. The phalangeal formula is\r\n2-2-3-4-3; the terminal phalanges are claw-shaped.\r\n\r\n_Developmental Cranial Morphology of Smilisca baudini_\r\n\r\nThe following description of development of the skull of _Smilisca\r\nbaudini_ is based on the examination of 12 cleared and stained\r\nspecimens. In table 3 the cranial bones are listed in the left hand\r\ncolumn in the approximate order of their appearance in the young frogs.\r\nAcross the top of the table selected specimens designated by\r\ndevelopmental stage or snout-vent length are listed. It should be noted\r\nthat although each individual, from left to right, has an increasing\r\nnumber of ossified bones, the correlation with increasing size is\r\nimperfect; the precise ages of the individuals are unknown.\r\n\r\nThe first bones to appear are the septomaxillaries, frontoparietals,\r\npart of the exoccipital, and the parasphenoid in developmental stage 40.\r\nThe frontoparietals are represented by two slender ossifications\r\ndorsomedial to the orbits; the septomaxillaries are present as small\r\nossifications anterior to the nasal capsules (Pl. 1A). The parasphenoid\r\nis present as a faint median ossification, and the exoccipital shows\r\nsome ossification.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Table 3.--The Order of Occurrence of Cranial Ossifications in the\r\n     Skull of Smilisca baudini.

They are present in developmental stage 44 before\r\nmetamorphosis is completed. The maxillaries bear a few teeth anteriorly\r\nand are ossified posteriorly to a point one-third of the distance from\r\nthe anterior to the posterior edge of the orbit. Ossification lengthens\r\nthe posterior termini of the maxillaries to the posterior edge of the\r\norbit. In front of the anterior margin of the orbit, bone is\r\nproliferated dorsal to the main axes of the maxillaries and forms\r\nmoderate dorsal maxillary flanges. The premaxillaries appear\r\nsimultaneously with the maxillaries. Initially they are widely separated\r\nmedially from each other, and laterally from the developing maxillaries;\r\neach bears two or three teeth, large dorsally blunt alary processes, and\r\nsmall palatine processes. The median and lateral edges of the prenasal\r\nprocesses lengthen heterochronously, causing the median edges to be\r\nlongest and to lie slightly dorsal to the level of the septomaxillaries.\r\nAfter the maxillaries and premaxillaries develop, the vomers appear as\r\nsmall horizontal ossifications anterior to the parasphenoid.\r\nOssification begins in the lateral flanges, then in the prevomerine\r\nprocesses, and lastly in the posterior dentigerous parts of the bones;\r\nthe prevomerine processes are the last parts of the vomers to ossify\r\ncompletely.\r\n\r\nInitially the frontoparietals are present as thin rods of ossification\r\ndorsomedial to the orbits; the frontoparietals extend from the anterior\r\nto the posterior end of the orbit by developmental stage 44. The\r\nanterior ends of the bones remain thin and pointed; ossification\r\nprogresses medially from the midpoint of the length of the orbit and\r\nposteriorly to the level of the exoccipital; a median center of\r\nossification joins the frontoparietals posteriorly, thereby forming the\r\nposterior border of the frontoparietal fontanelle. The supraorbital\r\nflanges of the frontoparietals do not appear until all other cranial\r\nbones are ossified, or nearly so. The most rapid ossification begins\r\nlaterally at the posterior edge of the orbit and decreases anteriorly\r\nover the posterior half of the orbit. This differential rate of\r\nproliferation of bone results in the pattern of development of the\r\nsupraorbital flanges shown in figure 7. The nasals appear as\r\nthin slivers of bone half way between the anterior ends of the\r\nfrontoparietals and the end of the snout. As ossification proceeds the\r\nnasals assume a triangular shape in dorsal view. The anterior ends are\r\npointed; the lateral margins are parallel to the maxillaries. The\r\nposteromedial points do not reach the lateral margins of the ethmoid,\r\nand the maxillary processes extend about three-fourths the distance from\r\nthe bodies of the nasals to the maxillaries. Following the union of the\r\nfrontoparietals posteriorly, the nasals widen anteriorly and are\r\nnarrower at the midpoints of their long axes than anteriorly or\r\nposteriorly. With further ossification the maxillary processes extend to\r\nthe maxillaries and form complete bony anterior margins to the orbits;\r\nthe mid-parts of the nasals widen (Pl. 1B).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 7. Developmental sequence of the frontoparietal\r\n       fontanelle and associated bony elements in _Smilisca baudird_:\r\n       (A) KU 60026, x5; (B) KU 85438, x4; (C) KU 26328, x3;\r\n       (D) KU 68184, x2.3.]\r\n\r\nThe parasphenoid is the first of the palatal bones to appear. At\r\nmetamorphosis the bone is well developed; the anterior tip is situated\r\njust in front of the anterior edge of the orbit, and posteriorly the\r\nlateral processes extend laterally beyond the ossified parts of the\r\nauditory region. The pterygoids do not appear until metamorphosis, when\r\nossification is evident in only the mid-parts of the posterolateral\r\narms. Ossification follows in the mid-parts of the anterolateral arms\r\nand occurs last in the pterygoid pedicles. The palatines do not appear\r\nuntil all three arms of the pterygoids are at least partly ossified.\r\nOssification proceeds rapidly from the maxillaries medially to the\r\nunossified ethmoid, which is the last of the cranial bones to appear.\r\nInitially it is extremely shallow; dorsally it is widely separated from\r\nthe nasals, and ventrally the posterior margin meets the anterior point\r\nof the parasphenoid. In dorsal view, ossification proceeds anteriorly\r\nbetween the nasals and posteriorly, ventral to the frontoparietals;\r\nventrally, ossification proceeds posteriorly dorsal to the parasphenoid.\r\n\r\nThe ventral arms of the squamosal and the supraoccipital region of the\r\nexoccipital are the first occipital bones to appear. Ossification\r\nfollows in the regions of the semicircular canals and occipital\r\ncondyles. The dorsal end of the ventral arm of the squamosal and the\r\nposterior arm of the squamosal ossify as a unit at the same time the\r\nquadratojugal appears. Shortly thereafter the anterior arm of the\r\nsquamosal ossifies, the distal part of the columella appears, and the\r\nanterior and lateral parts of the auditory region ossify.\r\n\r\nThe angular and dentary of the lower jaw appear concurrently with the\r\ndentigerous bones. Initially, the angular is short and broad; the\r\narticular surface is absent, and the anterior end is slightly overlapped\r\nby the dentary. The mentomecklians do not ossify until approximately\r\nthe same time that the quadratojugal appears in the upper jaw.\r\n\r\n_Comparative Osteology_\r\n\r\nThe genus _Smilisca_ is characterized by the following combination of\r\ncranial osteological characters: (1) A large amount of bone is involved\r\nin the skull and a minimal amount of cartilage and/or secondarily\r\nossified cartilage; co-ossification is absent. (2) The skulls are\r\nuniformly broad with angular lateral margins, and truncate anteriorly.\r\n(3) An internasal septum and quadratojugals are present. (4) A\r\nwell-developed squamosal minimally extends one-fourth the distance from\r\nthe dorsal end of the quadrate to the maxillary, and maximally is\r\nseparated from the maxillary by a suture. (5) The ethmoid is large; the\r\ndistance between the anterior end of the ethmoid and the anterior edge\r\nof the premaxillary varies between 15 and 20 per cent of the total\r\nlength of the skull.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of cranial osteology two species-groups can be recognized\r\nwithin the genus _Smilisca_. The _sordida_ group, comprising _S.\r\nsordida_ and _puma_, is characterized by a broad skull in which the\r\nlateral margins of the maxillaries are relatively straight anterior to\r\nthe orbit. The moderate-sized nasals are rounded anteriorly, and bear\r\nrelatively short, sometimes blunt, maxillary processes. The long axes of\r\nthe nasals are not parallel to the maxillaries. The ethmoid is\r\nproportionately small in the _sordida_ group. The bony part of the\r\nethmoid terminates near the anterior edge of the orbits and does not\r\nextend anteriorly between the nasals; the entire anterior margin of the\r\nethmoid is separated from the nasals by cartilage. The squamosals are\r\ngenerally small. They are narrow in dorsal view, and minimally extend\r\none-fourth the distance from the dorsal end of the quadrate to the\r\nmaxillary, and maximally, two-thirds the distance. The tegmen tympani\r\nare relatively small (Fig. 8).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 8. Dorsal views of the skulls of the species of\r\n       _Smilisca_: (A) _S. baudini_ (KU 68184); (B) _S. puma_ (KU 68636);\r\n       (C) _S. phaeota_ (KU 41090); (D) _S. sila_ (KU 80625); (E) _S.\r\n       cyanosticta_ (KU 55938), and (F) _S. sordida_ (KU 36765). x1.5.]\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the tendency for reduction of cranial parts in the\r\n_sordida_ group, the _baudini_ group, constituted by _S. cyanosticta_,\r\n_phaeota_, and _baudini_, is characterized by more ossification of the\r\ncranial elements. The skull is broad; the lateral margins are less\r\nangular and are gently curved, rather than straight as in the _sordida_\r\ngroup. The nasals tend to be larger with the long axes parallel to the\r\nmaxillary. Anteriorly the nasals are pointed, and posteriorly they bear\r\nlong, delicate palatine processes extending to the maxillary. The\r\nethmoid is fully ossified, extends anteriorly between the nasals, and\r\nlaterally is separated by a suture from the nasals if the latter are\r\nfully ossified. The squamosals are large, and wide in dorsal view. They\r\nminimally extend one-fourth the distance from the dorsal end of the\r\nquadrate to the maxillary, and maximally are sutured to the maxillary.\r\nThe tegmen tympani are massive.\r\n\r\n_Smilisca sila_ is intermediate between the two species-groups\r\ndescribed. The skull is broad; the lateral margins are gently curved,\r\nand have a pronounced angularity just anterior to the palatines which\r\nresults in a broad, truncate snout. The nasals are moderate in size;\r\nbecause of the anterior angularity of the lateral margins, the long axes\r\nof the nasals lie parallel to the maxillary. The nasals are only\r\nslightly pointed anteriorly, and posteriorly they bear short, blunt\r\npalatine processes and medial processes in contact with the lateral\r\ncorners of the ethmoid. The ethmoid is fully ossified, but does not\r\nextend anteriorly between the nasals. The squamosals are moderate in\r\nsize and extend one-fourth the distance from the dorsal end of the\r\nquadrate to the maxillary. The tegmen tympani are relatively large, but\r\nproportionately short.\r\n\r\nThe cranial characters utilized in the analysis of species groups\r\n(general shape, nature of the nasals, ethmoid, squamosals, and tegmen\r\ntympani), together with other characters, such as the relative height\r\nand shape of the prenasal processes, the extent of the internasal\r\nseptum, and the nature of the vomers, frontoparietals, maxillaries and\r\npterygoids are useful in distinguishing the various species (Table 4,\r\nFig. 8), as well as in establishing relationships within the\r\nspecies-groups.\r\n\r\nWithin the _sordida_ group, _S. sordida_ and _S. puma_ can be\r\ndistinguished by the following characters: The bony part of the ethmoid\r\nterminates posterior to the anterior edge of the orbit and is thus\r\nwidely separated from the nasals by cartilage in _S. puma_. In _S.\r\nsordida_ the bony part of the ethmoid always terminates at a level equal\r\nto, or slightly in front of the anterior edge of the orbit; therefore,\r\nless cartilage exists between the ethmoid and nasals in _S. sordida_\r\nthan in _S. puma_. The width of the premaxillary comprises about 30 per\r\ncent of the width of the skull in _S. sordida_ and 20 per cent in _S.\r\npuma_. The proportion of the length of the skull anterior to the bony\r\npart of the ethmoid in _S. sordida_ is approximately 21 per cent, as\r\ncompared with about 29 per cent in _S. puma_. The prenasal processes are\r\nconvex in _S. sordida_ and straight in _S. puma_.\r\n\r\nThe marked ontogenetic variation in _S. sordida_ is considered in more\r\ndetail in the account of that species, but it is pertinent to the\r\npresent discussion to note that with respect to some features of the\r\nskull some young breeding specimens of _S. sordida_ are intermediate in\r\nappearance between large females of _S. sordida_ and adults of _S.\r\npuma_. In some breeding males (usually the smaller individuals) of _S.\r\nsordida_ the bony part of the ethmoid terminates at the anterior edge of\r\nthe orbit and is widely separated from the nasals by cartilage. In small\r\nindividuals _S. sordida_, especially in males, and in adults of _S.\r\npuma_ the tegmen tympani are relatively short, whereas in adult females\r\nof _S. sordida_ these elements are long and slender. In the smaller\r\nspecimens of _S. sordida_ and in _S. puma_ the squamosal is small; it\r\nextends only about one-fourth of the distance to the maxillary in the\r\nsmaller _S. sordida_ and about one-half the distance in _S. puma_. The\r\nmore massive squamosal in large adult females of _S. sordida_ extends at\r\nleast two-thirds of the distance to the maxillary.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Table 4.--Comparative Cranial Osteology of Smilisca.\r\n\r\n  ===============+==============================+=======================\r\n    Character    |         _S. baudini_         |   _S. cyanosticta_\r\n  ---------------+------------------------------+-----------------------\r\n                 |                              |\r\n  Alary Processes| Four times as high as        | Three times as high\r\n                 | lateral wing of premaxillary;| as lateral wing of\r\n                 | anteriorly                   | premaxillary;\r\n                 | convex.                      | anteriorly\r\n                 |                              | convex.\r\n                 |                              |\r\n  Nasals         | Long, wide anteriorly,       | Long, widest\r\n                 | narrowing posteriorly;

the cranial characters are\r\nintermediate between _S. phaeota_ and _S. baudini_. The lateral margins\r\nof the skull in _S. cyanosticta_ are gently curved, and have an\r\nangularity anterior to the palatine-maxillary suture; the anterior\r\nmargins are less angular in _S. phaeota_, which has a broader snout.\r\nPosteriorly in _S. baudini_ the margins are slightly curved\r\nmedially, and the greatest width of the skull is between the\r\nquadratojugal-maxillary sutures on either side of the skull. The\r\nfrontoparietals of _S. cyanosticta_ bear slightly irregular lateral\r\nmargins and a large fontanelle. There is a tendency for obliteration of\r\nthe fontanelle with increasing age in both _S. baudini_ and _S.\r\ncyanosticta_; the lateral margins of the frontoparietals bear large\r\nsupraorbital flanges in both of these species. In _S. phaeota_ the\r\nflanges are most prominent; they extend posterolaterally with straight\r\nmargins along two-thirds of the length of the orbit and terminate in\r\nrather blunt points. The broad interorbital flanges result in a\r\nrelatively broad external interorbital distance. In _S. baudini_ the\r\nflanges are curved posterolaterally around the orbit and terminate in\r\nsharp, thin points. The tegmen tympani of all three species are massive.\r\nIn _S. cyanosticta_ the prooetics slope posteriorly, whereas they slope\r\nanteriorly in _S. baudini_ and _S. phaeota_.\r\n\r\nThe skulls of _S. cyanosticta_ and _S. baudini_ are alike in certain\r\nrespects. The squamosals of both species are large and connected to the\r\nmaxillary by a bony connection; the squamosals of _S. phaeota_ are\r\nlarge, but extend only two-thirds of the distance from the dorsal end of\r\nthe quadrate to the maxillary. In _S. baudini_ and _S. cyanosticta_ the\r\nnasals are separated throughout their lengths from the ethmoid, whereas\r\nthe nasals of _S. phaeota_ are separated from the ethmoid by cartilage.\r\nThe latter separation is due to an incomplete ossification of the nasals\r\nin _S. phaeota_. The bony part of each nasal is constricted in the\r\nmiddle of the long axis of the bone, and the nasals are widest\r\nanteriorly; posteriorly each nasal bears a medial process, which is\r\nnarrowly separated from the lateral edge of the ethmoid.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Table 5.--Variation in the Number of Teeth in the Species of\r\n     Smilisca.

The\r\nnumbers of maxillary, premaxillary, and vomerine teeth are summarized in\r\nTable 5. Smaller and presumably younger specimens of all species of\r\n_Smilisca_ have fewer teeth than do larger specimens of the same\r\nspecies. This correlation between size and number of teeth does not\r\nexist as an interspecific trend within the genus; for example, the\r\nsmallest species in the genus, _S. puma_, has the highest number of\r\nmaxillary teeth. In small specimens of a given species wide gaps are\r\npresent between the maxillary teeth posteriorly; in large specimens the\r\ngaps are filled by teeth, beginning anteriorly and progressing\r\nposteriorly, until the maxillary dentition is continuous.\r\n\r\n\r\nMusculature\r\n\r\nNo extensive study of the muscular system was undertaken, but certain\r\nmuscles know to be of taxonomic importance were studied.\r\n\r\n_Jaw Musculature._--Starrett (1960) pointed out the unique jaw\r\nmusculature in _Smilisca_. In this genus M. depressor mandibulae\r\nconsists of two parts, one arising from the dorsal fascia and one from\r\nthe posterior arm of the squamosal. Two muscles arise from the anterior\r\narm of the squamosal and insert on the lateral face of the mandible. Of\r\nthese muscles, M. adductor mandibulae posterior subexternus lies medial\r\nto the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve; the other, M. adductor\r\nmandibulae externus superficialis, lies lateral to the same nerve (Fig.\r\n9). In most other hylids the latter muscle is absent. No significant\r\nvariation in the position of the muscles was noted in the various\r\nspecies of _Smilisca_, though M. adductor mandibulae originate somewhat\r\nmore anteriorly in _S. baudini_ and _S. cyanosticta_ than in the other\r\nmembers of the genus, all of which have a shorter anterior arm of the\r\nsquamosal that does not reach the maxillary. The two separate parts of\r\nM. depressor mandibulae are not so widely separated in members of the\r\n_sordida_ group as in the _baudini_ group.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 9.

KU 64220, x 2.5.]\r\n\r\n_Throat Musculature._--The frogs that comprise the genus _Smilisca_ are\r\ncharacterized by paired subgular vocal sacs, essentially the same as\r\nthose in _Triprion_ (Duellman and Klaas, 1964). The following\r\ndescription is based on _Smilisca baudini_ (Fig. 10).\r\n\r\nM. submentalis lies in the anterior angle of the lower jaw, is thick,\r\nand consists of transverse fibers extending between the dentaries. M.\r\nsubmaxillaris is thin and arises from the whole of the inner surface of\r\nthe lower jaw, except for the anterior angle occupied by M. submentalis.\r\nAnteriorly M. submaxillaris is broadly attached by fascia to M.\r\nhyoglossus and M. geniohyoideus, which lie dorsal to M. submaxillaris.\r\nMedially this attachment continues posteriorly for about one-half the\r\nlength of the hyoglossus. Posteriorly M. submaxillaris is folded and\r\nattached to M. sternoradialis of the pectoral girdle. The vocal sacs are\r\nformed by a pair of posterolateral evaginations of M. submaxillaris; a\r\nbroad connection between the pouches allows free passage of air between\r\nthe pouches.\r\n\r\nThe deeper throat musculature is essentially the same as that described\r\nfor _Phrynohyas spilomma_ by Duellman (1956), except for slight\r\ndifferences in the place of attachment on the hyoid.\r\n\r\n\r\nSkin\r\n\r\n_Structure_\r\n\r\nThe skin of _Smilisca_ is typical of that of most hylids in organization\r\nand structure. _Smilisca sila_ is distinguished from other members of\r\nthe genus by the presence of small wartlike protrusions and peculiar\r\nwhite, pustular spots on the dorsum. The wartlike structures are\r\ncomposed of three or four epidermal cells, which protrude from the\r\nsurface of the epidermis; the structures are covered by a slightly\r\nthickened layer of keratin. The white pustules are slightly elevated\r\nabove the surrounding skin. Internally they consist of aggregations of\r\nswollen, granular, pigment-cells (perhaps lipophores) lying between the\r\nepidermis and the melanophores.\r\n\r\n_Biochemical Variations_\r\n\r\nDried skins of all species of _Smilisca_ were sent to Jose M. Cei,\r\nInstituto Nacional de Cuyo, Mendoza, Argentina, for biochemical\r\nscreening by means of the chromatographic techniques described by\r\nErspamer and Cei (1963). The species in the _baudini_ group have\r\ndetectable amounts of penta-hydroxi-trypatamine, whereas only a trace is\r\npresent in the other species. Furthermore, species in the _baudini_\r\ngroup differ from _S. sila_ and the _sordida_ group in lacking, or\r\nhaving only a trace of, tryptophan-containing polypeptides. These\r\nsuperficial biochemical tests support the arrangement of species as\r\nascertained by conventional taxonomic characters.\r\n\r\n\r\nExternal Morphological Characters\r\n\r\nThe features of external morphology that were studied in connection with\r\nthe taxonomy of the genus _Smilisca_ are discussed below.\r\n\r\n_Size and Proportions_\r\n\r\nThe frogs of the genus _Smilisca___ are medium to large tree frogs. The\r\nthree species comprising the _baudini_ group (_S. baudini_,\r\n_cyanosticta_, and _phaeota_) are notably larger than _S. puma_, _sila_,\r\nand _sordida_ (Table 6). The largest specimen that we examined is a\r\nfemale of _S. baudini_ having a snout-vent length of 90 mm. _Smilisca\r\npuma_ is the smallest species; the largest male has a snout-vent length\r\nof 38 mm. and the largest female, 46 mm.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Table 6.--Comparison of Sizes and Certain Proportions of the Species\r\n     of Smilisca.

The size of the tympanum relative to that\r\nof the eye is highly variable within samples of a given species. Even\r\nso, noticeable differences in the tympanum/eye ratio are apparent.\r\nMembers of the _baudini_ group have the largest tympani, whereas _S.\r\nsila_ and _sordida_ have the smallest, and _S. puma_ is intermediate\r\n(Table 6).\r\n\r\n_Shape of Snout_\r\n\r\nAlthough all members of the genus have rather truncate snouts, subtle\r\ndifferences exist among the species (Pl. 12). _Smilisca sila_ has the\r\nshortest snout; that of _S. baudini_ is only slightly longer. The snouts\r\nof _S. cyanosticta_ and _puma_ are nearly square in lateral profile,\r\nwhereas those of _S. phaeota_ and _sordida_ are slightly inclined. The\r\nshape of the snout is relatively uniform within each species and\r\ndisplays no noticeable sexual dimorphism, except in _S. sordida_, in\r\nwhich there are sexual differences and geographic variation (see p.\r\n324).\r\n\r\n_Hands and Feet_\r\n\r\nThe characters of the hands and feet are among the most taxonomically\r\nimportant external features in _Smilisca_. Consistent differences exist\r\nin relative lengths of the digits, size of subarticular tubercles, size\r\nand number of supernumerary tubercles, size and shape of the inner\r\nmetatarsal tubercle, and amount of webbing (Pls. 4 and 5). In the\r\n_baudini_ group the series of species (_baudini-phaeota-cyanosticta_)\r\nshow a progressive increase in amount of webbing in the hand and a\r\ndecrease in number, and corresponding increase in size, of supernumerary\r\ntubercles. The amount of webbing in the feet of _S. baudini_ and\r\n_phaeota_ is about the same, but the webbing is slightly more extensive\r\nin _S. cyanosticta_. _Smilisca puma_ is unique in the genus in lacking\r\nwebbing in the hand; furthermore, this species is distinctive in having\r\nmany large subarticular tubercles on the hand and a relatively small\r\ninner metatarsal tubercle. The two stream-inhabitants, _S. sila_ and\r\n_sordida_, have shorter and stouter fingers than the other species. The\r\nwebbing is most extensive in both the hands and feet of these species,\r\nwhich also are distinctive in having many small supernumerary tubercles\r\non the feet.\r\n\r\n_Ontogenetic Changes_\r\n\r\nMinor ontogenetic changes in structure involve the shape of the snout,\r\nrelative size of the eye, development of the tympanum, and amount of\r\nwebbing in the hand. In recently metamorphosed young the snout is more\r\nrounded than in adults; the canthus and loreal concavity are not\r\nevident. Usually the tympanum is not differentiated in recently\r\nmetamorphosed young, and the eye is proportionately large. The webbing\r\nin the feet is completely developed at metamorphosis, but young\r\nindividuals have noticeably less webbing in the hand than do adults of\r\nthe same species.\r\n\r\n\r\nColoration\r\n\r\nSome of the most distinctive characters of the species of _Smilisca_ are\r\ncolor and pattern of the living frogs. Although many chromatic features\r\nare lost or subdued in preserved specimens, the patterns usually\r\npersist.\r\n\r\n_Metachrosis_\r\n\r\nChange in color, well known in frogs, is common in hylids, especially in\r\nspecies having green dorsal surfaces (_Phyllomedusa_ is a notable\r\nexception). The non-green _Smilisca_ (_puma_, _sila_, and _sordida_)\r\nchanges color, but this mostly is a change in intensity of color. In\r\nthese species the markings usually are most distinct at night;\r\nfrequently by day the frogs become pallid. The most striking examples of\r\nmetachrosis in _Smilisca_ are found in the _baudini_ group, in which the\r\ndorsal ground-color changes from green to tan; correlated with the\r\nchange in ground-color may be a corresponding change in the dorsal\r\nmarkings, but the dorsal markings may change to the opposite color.\r\n\r\n\r\nChromosomes\r\n\r\nChromosomes of all six species of _Smilisca_ were studied by means of\r\nthe propriono-orcein squash technique described by Duellman and Cole\r\n(1965). Karyotype analysis was attempted for several species by means of\r\nintraperitoneal injections of colchicine, which affected the mitotic\r\ncells as desired, but the testes examined contained too few mitotic\r\ncells to allow accurate determination of karyotypes.\r\n\r\nHaploid (_n_) chromosome numbers were determined from cells in\r\ndiakinesis, metaphase I, and metaphase II of meiosis. Diploid (2_n_)\r\nchromosome numbers were determined from cells in late prophase and\r\nmetaphase of mitosis. Chromosome counts from as few as 23 meiotic cells\r\nof _S. phaeota_ and as many as 80 cells of _S. sordida_ reveal a\r\nconstant haploid (_n_) number of 12; counts of chromosomes in one to\r\nfive mitotic cells in all species, except _S. sila_, reveal that the\r\ndiploid (2_n_) number is 24.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\nBreeding\r\n\r\nLike most hylid frogs _Smilisca_ is most readily collected and observed\r\nwhen individuals congregate for breeding.\r\n\r\n_Time of Breeding_\r\n\r\n_Smilisca_ breeds primarily in quiet water and reaches its height of\r\nbreeding activity at times of plentiful rainfall,--usually from May\r\nthrough October. Through most of its range _Smilisca baudini_ breeds in\r\nthose months, but in some places where abundant rain falls in other\r\nseasons, the species breeds at those times. For example, in southern El\r\nPeten and northern Alta Verapaz, Guatemala, _Smilisca baudini_ has been\r\nfound breeding in February and March. The other pond-breeding species\r\n(_S. cyanosticta_, _phaeota_, and _puma_) live in regions lacking a\r\nprolonged dry season, and possibly they breed throughout the year, but\r\nbreeding activity seems to be greatest in the rainiest months.\r\n\r\nThe two stream-breeding species (_S. sila_ and _sordida_) breed in the\r\ndry season when the streams are low and clear, principally in December\r\nthrough April. At high elevations the species sometimes breed in the\r\nrainy season; also, individuals sometimes breed in the short dry season\r\n(summer canicula) in July and August.\r\n\r\nAt several localities species have been found breeding at different\r\ntimes of the year: _S. baudini_ in March and July at Chinaja, Guatemala;\r\n_S. phaeota_ in April and August at Palmar Sur, Costa Rica; _S. puma_ in\r\nFebruary and July at Puerto Viejo, Costa Rica; and _S. sila_ in\r\nFebruary, April, and August at El Volcan, Panama. These observations\r\nindicate only that the population breeds at more than one time in the\r\nyear, but do not provide any evidence on the breeding cycles of the\r\nindividual frogs. This is one important aspect of the natural history of\r\n_Smilisca_ for which we lack data.\r\n\r\n_Breeding Sites_\r\n\r\nAll members of the genus _Smilisca_ presumably deposit their eggs in\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n_Smilisca baudini_ usually breeds in temporary rain pools; often these\r\nare nothing more than shallow, muddy puddles. In other instances the\r\nsites are extensive ditches or large flooded areas (Pl. 8, Fig. 1). This\r\nspecies is an opportunistic breeder, and males gather at any of a wide\r\nvariety of suitable breeding sites that are formed by torrential rains\r\nin the early part of the rainy season. _Smilisca baudini_ nearly always\r\nbreeds in open pools having bare earthen edges. Frequently congregations\r\nof _S. baudini_ are found at such small pools, but are absent from\r\nnearby large ponds surrounded by vegetation.\r\n\r\nLittle is known of the breeding habits of _S. cyanosticta_, which\r\ninhabits humid forests on foothills and lowlands. Apparently its\r\nbreeding sites are not unlike those of _S. phaeota_, which usually are\r\npools surrounded by vegetation (Pl. 8, Fig. 2), although sometimes males\r\nof _S. cyanosticta_ call from open muddy puddles. In uplands, where\r\nstanding water is uncommon, this species breeds in quiet pools in\r\nstreams.\r\n\r\n_Smilisca puma_ breeds in grass-choked ponds and marshes, where the\r\nmales call from bases of dense clumps of grass in the water (Pl. 9, Fig.\r\n1).\r\n\r\n_Smilisca sila_ and _S. sordida_ differ noticeably from other species in\r\nthe genus by breeding exclusively in streams, where males usually call\r\nfrom rocks or gravel bars in or at the edges of streams (Pl. 9, Fig. 2);\r\nsometimes individuals perch on bushes overhanging streams. In the\r\nstreams, or parts of streams, utilized by these frogs the water is\r\nclear, shallow, and has a slow gradient; occasional males have been\r\nfound calling along cascading mountain streams.\r\n\r\nBreeding choruses composed of ten or more species of frogs are not\r\nuncommon in Middle America, but _Smilisca_ usually breeds alone or with\r\none or two other species and at the most five others. This tendency\r\ntowards solitary breeding possibly is the result of selection of\r\nbreeding sites that are unsuitable to many other species of frogs.\r\nNevertheless, many other species of frogs have been found at the\r\nbreeding sites with the various species of _Smilisca_; these breeding\r\nassociates (Table 7) are most numerous for _S. baudini_, which has a\r\nbroad geographic range, including a variety of habitats.\r\n\r\n_Breeding Behavior_\r\n\r\n_Calling sites._--All species of _Smilisca_ usually call from the\r\nground, including rocks and gravel bars; some individuals sit in shallow\r\nwater near the edge of the pool or stream. Sometimes males of _S.\r\nbaudini_, _sila_, and _sordida_ call from low bushes or trees near the\r\nbreeding site. One _S. baudini_ was observed calling while it was\r\nfloating on the surface of a pond. _Smilisca cyanosticta_, _phaeota_,\r\nand _puma_ call from secluded places at the edge of the water or in the\r\nwater, whereas _S. baudini_, _sila_ and _sordida_ call from open\r\nsituations.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Table 7.--Breeding Associates of the Various Species of Smilisca.\r\n\r\n  ==============================+========+============+========+=====+=====+========\r\n  Associate                     |_S.     |_S.         |_S.     |_S.  |_S.  |_S.\r\n                                |baudini_|cyanosticta_|phaeota_|puma_|sila_|sordida_\r\n  ------------------------------+--------+------------+--------+-----+-----+--------\r\n  _Rhinophrynus dorsalis_       |   X    |     -

This is\r\nespecially noticeable in _S. baudini_, in which the members of a duet\r\noften call from sites separated by only a few centimeters. The call of\r\n_S. baudini_ consists of a series of like notes (see description of call\r\nin following section); the duration of each note is about equal to the\r\ninterval between notes. Normally one individual utters one note, pauses,\r\nand utters a single note again, or series of two or three notes. If\r\nthere is no response, the first individual often waits several seconds\r\nor even several minutes and then repeats the call. The second individual\r\nusually responds after the first or second note of the sequence. The\r\nnotes of the second individual usually are spaced so that they are\r\nemitted in the intervals between the notes of the first individual. This\r\ncan be shown diagrammatically by having the figure \"1\" represent notes\r\nof the first individual and figure \"2,\" the notes of the second; an\r\nempty interval is represented by \"0\":\r\n\r\n   1-0-1-2-1-2-1-2-1-2-1-2\r\n\r\nUsually a chorus is initiated by one duet and is quickly picked up by\r\nother individuals also calling in duets. A numerical representation of a\r\nchorus of eight frogs would approximate the following organization:\r\n\r\n   1-0-1-2-1-2-1-2-1-2-1-2-1-2\r\n           3-0-3-4-3-4-3-4-3-4-3-4-3\r\n            5-6-5-6-5-6-5-6-5-6-5-6\r\n            7-8-7-8-7-8-7-8-7-8-7-8\r\n\r\nAfter the first one or two duets are initiated, the second individuals\r\nin the following duets usually call immediately after their respective\r\npartners have given the first notes. The other noteworthy aspect about\r\nthe organization is that the entire chorus usually stops abruptly.\r\nNormally the first duet stops calling shortly before the others, but\r\nthis is not invariable. Often one duet or one individual will emit\r\nseveral notes after the rest of the frogs have become silent. An\r\ninterval of several minutes sometimes elapses before the chorus begins\r\nagain. Successive choruses apparently are initiated by the same duet.\r\nResponses can be initiated artificially by imitating the call, and\r\nsometimes any loud noise will start a chorus.\r\n\r\nSimilar duets have been observed in _S. phaeota_. In this species the\r\nintervals are often much longer than the notes, and if two males are\r\ncalling in close proximity, their calls can be mistaken for those of one\r\nindividual. _Smilisca phaeota_ does not congregate in large numbers;\r\nusually only two males call from one restricted site.\r\n\r\n_Smilisca sila_ has a call consisting of a primary note followed by one\r\nor more secondary notes. Males often call in duets, but not necessarily\r\nso. In a duet, the first male usually utters only primary notes until\r\nthe second individual responds; then each individual produces a rapid\r\nseries of secondary notes.\r\n\r\n_Smilisca puma_ also produces primary and secondary notes. Although\r\nindividuals sometimes call alone, duets, trios, or quartets were more\r\ncommon. The chorus is initiated by one individual uttering primary notes\r\nuntil joined by the second, third, and fourth frogs. In one quartet in a\r\nmarsh 7.5 kilometers west of Puerto Viejo, Costa Rica, on February 19,\r\n1965, the same individual initiated four consecutive choruses. Each time\r\nthe second member of the chorus was the same; the third and fourth frogs\r\njoined the chorus nearly simultaneously.\r\n\r\nIndividuals of _S. sordida_ are usually irregularly situated along a\r\nstream. No duets or other combinations of individuals are apparent in\r\nthe chorus structure, but once an individual calls, a frog nearby calls\r\nalmost immediately; then a frog near the second individual calls, and so\r\non. The resulting series of calls gives the impression that the sound is\r\nmoving along the stream as successive individuals join the chorus and\r\nthe first callers become quiet. It is not known if the same individual\r\ninitiates successive choruses or if the order of calling is the same in\r\nsubsequent choruses.\r\n\r\nThese limited observations on chorus structure in _Smilisca_ show the\r\npresence of behavioral organization. The methods of establishing the\r\norganization and the significance of the call-order in breeding have yet\r\nto be discovered.\r\n\r\nCalling males of _S. baudini_ are often close together; some individuals\r\nhave been observed almost touching one another, but no indication of\r\nterritoriality or aggressive behavior has been witnessed. The more\r\ndistant spacing of the stream-breeding species _S. sila_ and _S.\r\nsordida_ may be a function of calling-territories, but no direct\r\nevidence is available to substantiate this supposition.\r\n\r\n_Sex recognition and amplexus._--Observations on _Smilisca baudini_\r\nindicate that the calls of males attract females. At Tehuantepec,\r\nOaxaca, Mexico, a female was first observed about two meters away from a\r\nmale calling at the edge of a rain pool; in a series of short hops she\r\nprogressed directly towards the male, although vegetation obscured him\r\nuntil she was less than a meter away. When she approached to within\r\nabout 20 centimeters of the male, he took notice of her, moved to her,\r\nand clasped her. At Chinaja, Alta Verapaz, Guatemala, a female swam\r\ndirectly across a pool about three meters wide to a calling male. Her\r\nline of movement took her within a few centimeters of a silent male, to\r\nwhom she paid no attention. She stopped just in front of the calling\r\nmale, which immediately clasped her. At a large muddy pond 4 kilometers\r\nwest-northwest of Esparta, Puntarenas, Costa Rica, a female was observed\r\nswimming toward a small submerged tree; a male was calling from a branch\r\nabout one meter above the water. The female climbed to a branch about 20\r\ncentimeters below the male, which upon seeing her there immediately\r\njumped down and clasped her. These few observations of _S. baudini_ show\r\nthat in this species females are capable of locating calling males by\r\nmeans of phono-orientation; visual reception on the part of females\r\nseems to be secondary. Contrariwise, males apparently become aware of\r\nthe proximity of females by seeing them; once a male sees a female he\r\nusually tries to clasp her. Possibly the males receive stimuli by means\r\nof chemo-reception, but in each observed instance the male obviously\r\nlooked at the female.\r\n\r\nAmplexus is axillary in all members of the genus. Normally amplexing\r\nmales hunch their backs and press their chins to the females' backs.\r\nClasping pairs are usually found at the edge of the water, but sometimes\r\namplexus takes place in trees or bushes.\r\n\r\n_Egg deposition._--Oviposition has been observed only in _Smilisca\r\nbaudini_. On the night of June 28, 1961, at Chinaja, Alta Verapaz,\r\nGuatemala, a clasping pair was observed at the edge of a shallow rain\r\npool. After sitting for several minutes in shallow water, the female\r\n(with male on her back) swam part way across the pool and grasped an\r\nemergent stick with one hand. The female's body was nearly level with\r\nthe surface of the water, and her hind legs were outstretched as\r\ndeposition commenced; eggs were extruded rapidly. After a few seconds\r\nthe female moved slowly to another twig a few centimeters away and\r\ndeposited more eggs. This process was repeated until the female was\r\nspent. The spawn resulted in a surface film covering roughly one square\r\nmeter. It is doubtful if this type of egg deposition occurs in any other\r\nspecies in the genus, especially those that lay their eggs in streams.\r\n\r\n_Breeding Call_\r\n\r\nThe breeding calls of the six species of _Smilisca_ are alike in their\r\nexplosive nature. Calls are emitted quickly with a short burst of air\r\nfilling the vocal sac, which immediately deflates. Phonetically the\r\ncalls can be described as a single \"wonk\" or series of such notes in _S.\r\nbaudini_ and _S. cyanosticta_, a low growl in _S. phaeota_, a relatively\r\nhigh pitched rattle in _S. sordida_, and a low squawk usually followed\r\nby one or more rattling secondary notes in _S. puma_ and _S. sila_.\r\nQuantitatively, the calls of the six species differ in number of notes,\r\nduration of notes, and in pitch (Table 8, Pls. 10 and 11). Although no\r\nmeasurements were taken on the intensity of the calls, we observed in\r\nthe field that each of the species has a loud voice. The call of _S.\r\nbaudini_ seems to carry farther than any of the others.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Table 8.--Comparison of Breeding Calls in Smilisca. (Observed Range\r\n     Given in Parentheses Below Mean.

In _S. baudini_,\r\n_cyanosticta_, _phaeota_, and _sordida_, call-groups are produced as\r\nfrequently as every 12 seconds, but usually more time elapses between\r\ncall groups. In _S. sordida_, five or more minutes sometimes elapse\r\nbetween call-groups. The interval is somewhat less in _S. phaeota_.\r\nCalls are repeated at much shorter intervals in _S. puma_ (5-55 seconds)\r\nand _S. sila_ (4-20 seconds).\r\n\r\n_Notes per call-group._--Except for _S. puma_ and _S. sila_, the series\r\nof notes produced in any given call of a species of _Smilisca_ is\r\nessentially the same; there is no differentiation into primary and\r\nsecondary notes. _Smilisca cyanosticta_ and _S. phaeota_ emit only one\r\nor two relatively long notes per call-group, whereas _S. baudini_ and\r\n_S. sordida_ produce as many as 15 and 6 notes, respectively. Males of\r\n_S. puma_ and _S. sila_ often produce only the primary note; sometimes\r\nthis is done several times before the secondary notes are produced. For\r\nexample, one _S. puma_ (KU 91711; tape No. 379) produced the following\r\nnumber of notes in consecutive call-groups: 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4;\r\nsecondary notes are present in only four of the nine call-groups. A\r\ntypical series of consecutive call-groups in _S. sila_ (KU 91852; Tape\r\nNo. 385) has 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 2 notes per call-group; secondary notes are\r\npresent in only half of the call-groups. _Smilisca puma_ apparently\r\nalways produces at least two primary notes before emitting secondary\r\nnotes; sometimes only primary notes are produced in one series of calls.\r\nThe number of secondary notes following a given primary varies from one\r\nto nine; the modal number is one, and the mean is three in 27\r\ncall-groups. _Smilisca sila_ frequently begins a series of calls with\r\ntwo or more primary notes, but sometimes the first primary note is\r\nfollowed immediately by two or more secondary notes. The number of\r\nsecondary notes following a given primary varies from one to five; the\r\nmodal number is one, and the average is two in 13 call-groups.\r\n\r\n_Duration._--The average duration of call-groups consisting of two or\r\nmore notes is 1.18 seconds in _S. baudini_; 1.02 in _cyanosticta_, 0.91\r\nin _phaeota_, 1.32 in _puma_, 1.48 in _sila_, and 1.29 in _sordida_.\r\nAlthough there is considerable variation in the lengths of the notes\r\n(only primary notes in _S. puma_ and _sila_ are considered here), _S.\r\ncyanosticta_, _phaeota_, and _sordida_ have noticeably longer notes than\r\ndo the other species (Table 8). The secondary notes are longer than the\r\nprimary notes in _S. puma_ (average 0.27 secs. as compared with 0.13\r\nsecs.) and in _S. sila_ (average 0.25 secs., as compared with 0.16\r\nsecs.).\r\n\r\n_Note repetition rate._--The rate at which notes in call-groups\r\ncontaining two or more notes are produced varies in _S. baudini_ from\r\n2.5 to 7.1 (average, 3.7) calls per second; _cyanosticta_, 1.8-2.1\r\n(1.9); _phaeota_, 2.0-2.4 (2.2); _puma_, 1.9-2.9 (2.2); _sila_, 1.3-2.4\r\n(1.8); and _sordida_, 1.5-2.6 (2.1). _Smilisca baudini_, which has\r\nnotes of short duration (0.09 to 0.13 seconds), has the fastest\r\nnote-repetition rate. Although the individual notes of _S. cyanosticta_\r\nand _S. phaeota_ are relatively long (average, 0.38 and 0.31 seconds,\r\nrespectively), the intervals between the notes is short; consequently,\r\ntheir note-repetition rates do not differ greatly from those of _S.\r\npuma_ and _S. sila_, which have shorter notes (average, 0.13 and 0.16\r\nseconds, respectively) but longer intervals between notes.\r\n\r\n_Pulse rate._--Pulses vary in frequency from 78 to 240 per second in the\r\ncalls analyzed (only primary notes in _S. puma_ and _S. sila_), but the\r\nvariation in any given species is much less than that in the entire\r\ngenus (Table 8). _Smilisca puma_ is outstanding in having a high pulse\r\nrate, which is approached only by that of _S. baudini_. Even in the\r\nspecies having the lowest pulse rates, the pulsations are not audible.\r\nThe secondary notes produced by _S. puma_ and _S. sila_ have a slower\r\npulse rate than the primary notes; often the pulses are audible. In _S.\r\npuma_ the pulse rate of secondary notes is sometimes as low as 48 pulses\r\nper second, and in _S. sila_ still lower (as low as 40 pulses per\r\nsecond). The upper limits of pulse rate in the secondary notes in these\r\nspecies merge imperceptibly with the rates of the primary note;\r\nconsequently, on the basis of pulse rate alone it is not always possible\r\nto distinguish primary from secondary notes.\r\n\r\n_Frequency._--_Smilisca_ produces noisy (as opposed to more musical)\r\ncalls, and the energy is distributed throughout the frequency spectrum;\r\nthe calls are poorly modulated, except in _S. sordida_, in which two\r\nusually discrete bands of frequency are present (Pl. 11C). For the most\r\npart the calls of _Smilisca_ consist of little modified energy of the\r\nfundamental frequency and of its harmonics, some of which are\r\nemphasized.\r\n\r\nThe upper frequency range varies within each species and even within the\r\ncalls of one individual. _Smilisca phaeota_ has the lowest upper\r\nfrequencies; no calls ranged above 4400 cycles per second (cps.), and\r\nhalf of the calls never exceeded 3000 cps. _Smilisca cyanosticta_\r\nproduces calls in which the upper frequency is below 7000 cps. and\r\nusually below 6000 cps. Likewise, _S. puma_ produces calls that are\r\nbelow 7000 cps., whereas _S. sila_ has frequencies of up to 8400 cps. In\r\nboth _S. baudini_ and _S. sordida_, the highest frequencies attained are\r\nabout 9100 cps. Variation in the highest frequencies in a series of\r\nconsecutive calls by one individual frog was noted in all species. Such\r\nvariation is especially prevalent in _S. puma_; for example one\r\nindividual (KU 87771; Tape No. 376) recorded at a temperature of 24 deg. C.\r\nat 7.5 kilometers west of Puerto Viejo, Heredia Province, Costa Rica, on\r\nJuly 31, 1964, produced three consecutive primary notes having upper\r\nfrequencies of about 6000, 4000, and 4000 cps., respectively. Apparently\r\nin a given species the production of the higher frequencies in some\r\nnotes and not in others is correlated with the amount of distention of\r\nthe vocal sac and is not dependent upon the structure or tension of the\r\nvocal cords.\r\n\r\nAlthough the dominant frequency in _S. sordida_ is lower than that in\r\n_S. baudini_ and _S. cyanosticta_, the call of the former is audibly\r\nhigher-pitched. This is due primarily to the emphasis on certain\r\nharmonics at a high frequency (sometimes as high as 9000 cps.) in _S.\r\nsordida_, whereas in _S. baudini_ and other species, if harmonics are\r\npresent at those frequencies, they are not emphasized.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental frequencies are as low as 90 cps. in _S. sila_ and _S.\r\nsordida_ and as high as 200 cps. in _S. puma_ (Table 8). The fundamental\r\nfrequency seemingly is relatively unimportant in determining the general\r\npitch of the call, a characteristic most dependent on the dominant\r\nfrequency and emphasized harmonics in the higher-frequency spectrum. In\r\nnone of the species is the fundamental the dominant frequency. In the\r\nlow-pitched call of _S. phaeota_ the dominant frequency is the third\r\nharmonic (the second harmonic above the fundamental frequency, which is\r\nthe first harmonic). In all other species a much higher harmonic is\r\ndominant; for examples, in _S. cyanosticta_ harmonics from 10 to 15 are\r\ndominant; in _S. baudini_, 15-19; and _S. sila_, 20-30.\r\n\r\nA glance at the audiospectrographs and their accompanying sections (Pls.\r\n10 and 11) reveals the presence of two emphasized bands of frequency in\r\nall species except _S. phaeota_, in which only the lower band is\r\npresent. These two bands of emphasized harmonics are part of a\r\ncontinuous, or nearly continuous, spread of energy throughout the\r\nfrequency spectrum, except in _S. sordida_ in which the bands are\r\nusually distinct. As shown in the sections, certain harmonics in each of\r\nthe bands are emphasized with nearly equal intensity. Therefore, with\r\nthe exception of _S. phaeota_, the calls of _Smilisca_ are characterized\r\nby two major frequencies, one of which is the dominant frequency and the\r\nother is a subdominant frequency (Table 8). The upper major frequency is\r\ndominant in all calls in _S. baudini_ and _S. cyanosticta_, but either\r\nmajor frequency may be dominant in other species. The upper major\r\nfrequency is dominant in 65 per cent of calls by _S. puma_, 87 per cent\r\nin _S. sila_, and 68 per cent in _S. sordida_. Individuals of these\r\nthree species sometimes produce a series of calls in which the dominant\r\nfrequency changes from one of the major frequencies to the other. Four\r\nconsecutive notes emitted by an individual of _S. sordida_ recorded 13\r\nkilometers east-northeast of Golfito, Puntarenas Province, Costa Rica,\r\nhad dominant frequencies of 910, 1950, and 750 cps., respectively. In\r\neach case, an alternation of major frequencies took place in respect to\r\ndominance. An individual of _S. puma_ from 7.5 kilometers west of Puerto\r\nViejo, Costa Rica, produced a primary note followed by one secondary\r\nnote; each note had major frequencies at 600 and 1800 cps.; the dominant\r\nfrequency of the primary note was at 1800 cps., whereas in the secondary\r\nnote the dominant frequency was at 600 cps. The difference in emphasis\r\non the major frequencies is so slight that shift in dominance is not\r\naudible.\r\n\r\n_Effect of temperature on calls._--The present data are insufficient to\r\ntest statistically the correlation between temperature and variation\r\nwithin certain components of the calls in _Smilisca_, but even a crude\r\ngraph shows some general correlations. The widest range of temperatures\r\nis associated with the recordings of _S. baudini_. Three individuals\r\nrecorded at a temperature of 30 deg. C. at Tehuantepec, Oaxaca, had pulse\r\nrates of 180 pulses per second and fundamental frequencies of 160-180\r\ncps., as compared with an individual recorded at a temperature of 17 deg.\r\nC., which had a pulse rate of 140 and a fundamental frequency of 135\r\ncps. All individuals of _S. baudini_ recorded at higher temperatures had\r\nfaster pulse rates and higher fundamental frequencies. Pulse rates\r\ndiffer in the other species in the genus but less strikingly (probably\r\nowing to narrower ranges of temperatures at which recordings were made).\r\nIn five recordings of _S. sordida_ made at 20 deg. C. the pulse rate is\r\n80-90, as compared with four recordings made at 25 deg. C. having pulse\r\nrates of 120-135. Thirteen recordings of _S. sila_ made at 17 deg. C. have\r\npulse rates of 97-112 (average 105); one individual recorded at 26 deg. C.\r\nhas 120 pulses per second. Seemingly no correlation exists between\r\ntemperature and other characteristics of the calls, such as duration and\r\nrate of note-repetition.\r\n\r\n_The breeding call as an isolating mechanism._--Blair (1958), Bogert\r\n(1960), Duellman (1963a), Fouquette (1960), Johnson (1959), and others\r\nhave provided evidence that the breeding calls of male hylids (and\r\nother anurans) serve as isolating mechanisms in sympatric species. In\r\nsummarizing this discussion of the breeding calls of _Smilisca_ we want\r\nto point out what seem to be important differences in the calls that may\r\nprevent interspecific hybridization in sympatric species of _Smilisca_.\r\n\r\nThe genus is readily divided into two species-groups on morphological\r\ncharacters; this division is supported by the breeding calls. In the\r\nspecies of the _baudini_ group the calls are unmodulated and lack\r\nsecondary notes. In the _sordida_ group the calls either have secondary\r\nnotes or are modulated.\r\n\r\n_Smilisca baudini_ occurs sympatrically with _S. cyanosticta_ and _S.\r\nphaeota_; where they occur together, both species sometimes breed in\r\nlike places at the same time. We are not aware of these species breeding\r\nsynchronously at exactly the same site, although _S. baudini_ and _S.\r\ncyanosticta_ were calling on the same nights and less than 100 meters\r\napart in Oaxaca in June, 1964. Regardless of their respective breeding\r\nhabits, sympatric species have calls that differ notably. Except for the\r\nhigher fundamental and dominant frequencies, the calls of _S.\r\ncyanosticta_ and _S. phaeota_ closely resemble one another, but the\r\ncalls of both species differ markedly from that of _S. baudini_. The\r\ngeographic ranges of _S. cyanosticta_ and _S. phaeota_ are widely\r\nseparated.\r\n\r\nThe calls of the allopatric species _S. puma_ and _S. sila_ are not\r\ngreatly different. _Smilisca sordida_ has a distinctive call and occurs\r\nsympatrically with _S. puma_ and _S. sila_. In the streams in southern\r\nCosta Rica _S. sordida_ and _S. sila_ breed synchronously, but the\r\nhigh-pitched modulated call of the former is notably different from the\r\nlower, unmodulated call of _S. sila_.\r\n\r\nThe data indicate that the calls of related sympatric species differ\r\nmore than the calls of related allopatric species. We postulate that\r\nthese differences evolved to support the reproductive isolation of the\r\nsympatric species. The data are insufficient to determine geographic\r\nvariation in the calls and to determine if differences in the calls are\r\nenhanced in areas of sympatry as compared with the allopatric parts of\r\nthe ranges.\r\n\r\n_Other calls._--As stated previously, there is no direct evidence of\r\nterritoriality in _Smilisca_; we have heard no calls that can be\r\ndefinitely identified as territorial. Single notes of _S. baudini_,\r\n_phaeota_, and _sila_ have been heard by day, just prior to rains, or\r\nduring, or immediately after rains. Such calls can be interpreted as\r\n\"rain calls,\" which are well known in _Hyla eximia_ and _Hyla\r\nsquirella_. Distress calls are known in several species of _Rana_ and in\r\n_Leptodactylus pentadactylus_; such calls result from the rapid\r\nexpulsion of air over the vocal cords and with the mouth open. Distress\r\ncalls have been heard from _S. baudini_. At Charapendo, Michoacan,\r\nMexico, a male that had one hind limb engulfed by a _Leptodeira\r\nmaculata_ emitted several long, high-pitched cries. A clasping pair of\r\n_S. baudini_ was found in a bush at the edge of a marshy stream 2\r\nkilometers northeast of Las Canas, Guanacaste Province, Costa Rica. When\r\nthe pair was grasped, the female emitted a distress call.\r\n\r\n\r\nEggs\r\n\r\nEggs of _S. baudini_, _cyanosticta_, and _phaeota_ have been found in\r\nthe field, and eggs of _S. sila_ have been observed in the laboratory.\r\nThe eggs of _S. puma_ and _sordida_ are unknown. Insofar as known,\r\n_Smilisca baudini_ is unique in the genus in depositing the eggs in a\r\nsurface film. Each egg is encased in a vitelline membrane, but\r\nindividual outer envelopes are lacking. The eggs are small; the diameter\r\nof recently-deposited eggs is about 1.3 mm. and that of the vitelline\r\nmembrane is about 1.5 mm. The eggs of _S. cyanosticta_ and _phaeota_ are\r\ndeposited in clumps, and the eggs are larger than those of _S. baudini_.\r\nDiameters of eggs of _S. cyanosticta_ are about 2.3 mm., and those of\r\nthe outer envelopes are about 4.0 mm. Artificially fertilized eggs of\r\n_S. sila_ raised in the laboratory have diameters of about 2.4 mm.; the\r\ndiameter of the outer envelopes is about 4.9 mm.\r\n\r\nIn order to determine the reproductive potential of the six species,\r\novulated eggs were removed from females and counted. The numbers of eggs\r\nrecorded are: 3 _S. baudini_--2620, 2940, 3320; 1 _S. cyanosticta_--910;\r\n3 _S. phaeota_--1665, 1870, 2010; 1 _S. puma_--518; 3 _S. sila_--369,\r\n390, 473; 3 _S. sordida_--524, 702, 856. These limited data indicate\r\nthat the large species (_S. baudini_, _cyanosticta_, and _phaeota_) have\r\nmore eggs than do the smaller species. The stream-breeding species (_S.\r\nsila_ and _sordida_) have relatively few eggs by comparison with the\r\npond-breeders. Possibly this is a function of size of eggs rather than a\r\ncorrelation with the site of egg-deposition.\r\n\r\n\r\nTadpoles\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of tadpoles of all of the species of _Smilisca_ has made\r\npossible the use of larval characters in erecting a classification and\r\nin estimating the phylogenetic relations of the several species.\r\nFurthermore, developmental series of tadpoles of four species allow a\r\ncomparison of the growth and development in these species. Throughout\r\nthe discussion of tadpoles we have referred to the various developmental\r\nstages by the Stage Numbers proposed by Gosner (1960).\r\n\r\n_General Structure_\r\n\r\nTadpoles of the genus _Smilisca_ are of a generalized hylid type, having\r\n2/3 tooth-rows, unspecialized beaks, mouth partly or completely bordered\r\nby papillae, lateral fold present in the lips, spiracle sinistral, anal\r\ntube dextral, and caudal musculature extending nearly to tip of caudal\r\nfin. Although minor differences exist in coloration, proportions, and\r\nmouthparts, no great modifications of the basic structure are present.\r\n\r\n_Comparison of Species_\r\n\r\nThe larval characters of the species of _Smilisca_ are compared below\r\nand illustrated in Figures 11-15.\r\n\r\n_Shape and Proportions._--The bodies of _S. baudini_, _cyanosticta_,\r\n_phaeota_, and _puma_ are rounded and about as wide as deep; the eyes\r\nare moderately large and directed dorsolaterally, and the nostrils are\r\nabout midway between the bluntly rounded snout and the eyes. The mouths\r\nare medium-sized and directed anteroventrally. The bodies of tadpoles of\r\n_S. sila_ and _sordida_ are slightly compressed dorso-ventrally. The\r\nsnout is moderately long and sloping; the eyes are larger and directed\r\nmore dorsally than in the other species, and the nostrils are closer to\r\nthe eyes than the snout. The mouths are moderately large and directed\r\nventrally.\r\n\r\nThe tail is about half again as long as the body in _S. baudini_,\r\n_cyanosticta_, _phaeota_, and _puma_; in these species the caudal\r\nmusculature is moderately heavy, and the caudal fins are deep. The\r\ncaudal musculature is upturned distally in _S. baudini_ and _phaeota_,\r\nand the dorsal fin extends anteriorly onto the body in these two species\r\nand in _S. puma_. The tail is about twice as long as the body in _S.\r\nsila_ and _sordida_. In both species the caudal fins are shallow in\r\ncomparison with the depth of the caudal musculature, especially in _S.\r\nsordida_ (Fig. 14); in neither species does the dorsal fin extend\r\nanteriorly onto the body.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 11. Tadpoles of _Smilisca baudini_: (A) Stage\r\n       21 (KU 62155) x 10; (B) Stage 25 (KU 68467) x 5; (C) Stage 30\r\n       (KU 60018) x 4; (D) Stage 41 (KU 60018) x 3.]\r\n\r\n_Mouthparts._--The mouth of _S. sordida_ is completely bordered by two\r\nrows of papillae, whereas in the other species the median part of the\r\nupper lip is devoid of papillae. _Smilisca baudini_ and _puma_ have two\r\nrows of papillae; _S. sila_ has one complete row (except medially on the\r\nupper lip) and one incomplete row, and _S. cyanosticta_ and _phaeota_\r\nhave only one row (Fig. 15). All species have numerous papillae in the\r\nlateral fold; the fewest lateral papillae are found in _S. cyanosticta_\r\nand _phaeota_. Although all species have two rows of teeth in the upper\r\njaw and three rows in the lower jaw, specific differences in the nature\r\nof the rows exist between certain species. The second upper tooth-row is\r\nnarrowly interrupted medially in _S. sila_ and _sordida_ and broadly\r\ninterrupted in the other species. The first upper row is strongly arched\r\nin _S. puma_, moderately arched in _S. baudini_ and _sila_, and weakly\r\narched in the other species. In all species the third lower tooth-row is\r\nthe shortest, only slightly so in _S. sila_ and _sordida_, but only\r\nabout half the length of the second lower row in _S. puma_.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 12. Tadpoles of _Smilisca cyanosticta_:\r\n       (A) Stage 21 (KU 87648) (B) Stage 25 (KU 87651) x 5;\r\n       (C) Stage 30 (KU 87652) x 4; (D) Stage 40 (KU 87650) x 3.]\r\n\r\nThe beaks are well developed and finely serrate in all species. The\r\nlower, broadly V-shaped, beak is slender in _S. puma_, rather robust in\r\n_S. baudini_ and _sila_, and moderately heavy in the other species. The\r\nlateral processes of the upper beak are shortest in _S. puma_ and\r\nlongest in _S. baudini_ and _sordida_. In the latter the inner margin of\r\nthe upper beak and lateral process have the form of a shallow S, whereas\r\nin the other species the inner margin of the upper beak forms a\r\ncontinuous arch with the lateral processes (Fig. 15).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 13. Tadpoles of _Smilisca phaeota_: (A) Stage 21\r\n       (KU 68479) x 14; (B) Stage 25 (KU 68480) x 5; (C) Stage 30 (KU\r\n       68482) x 4; (D) Stage 40 (KU 68483) x 3.]\r\n\r\n_Coloration._--The tadpoles of _Smilisca_ lack the bright colors or bold\r\nmarkings characteristic of some hylid tadpoles; even so, the subdued\r\ncolors and arrangement of pigments provide some distinctive markings by\r\nwhich the species can be distinguished from one another. The species\r\ncomprising the _baudini_ group (_S. baudini_, _cyanosticta_, and\r\n_phaeota_) are alike in having the body brown or grayish brown dorsally\r\nand transparent with scattered brown pigment ventrally. A cream-colored,\r\ncrescent-shaped mark is present on the posterior edge of the body; this\r\nmark is usually most noticeable in _S. baudini_ and least so in _S.\r\ncyanosticta_. Other differences in coloration in members of the\r\n_baudini_ group are relative and subtle. _Smilisca phaeota_ usually is\r\nmore pallid than _baudini_, and _cyanosticta_ usually is darker than\r\n_baudini_; both species have larger dark markings on the tail than does\r\n_S. phaeota_. _Smilisca baudini_ has a dark streak on the middle of the\r\nanterior one-fourth of the tail (Figs. 11-13).\r\n\r\n_Smilisca puma_ is distinctive in having a grayish brown body and dark\r\ngray reticulations on the tail. _Smilisca sila_ and _sordida_ are\r\ndistinctive in having pairs (sometimes interconnected) of dark marks on\r\nthe dorsal surfaces of the caudal musculature, and in dorsal view the\r\ntail appears to be marked with dark and pale creamy tan transverse bars.\r\nThese dark marks, as well as the small flecks on the tail, are brown in\r\n_S. sila_ and red in _sordida_. _Smilisca sila_ has dark brown flecks on\r\nthe dorsal surface of the body and small white flecks laterally; these\r\nmarkings are absent in _S. sordida_ (Fig. 14).\r\n\r\nDescriptions of the coloration of living tadpoles are given in the\r\naccounts of the species.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 14. Tadpoles of _Smilisca_; (A) _S. puma_,\r\n       Stage 30 (KU 91807); (B) _S. sila_, Stage 25 (KU 80260);\r\n       _S. sordida_, Stage 30 (KU 68475). All x 3.5.]\r\n\r\n_Growth and Development_\r\n\r\nInformation on the growth and development of Middle American hylids is\r\nscanty. Adequate descriptions have been published for _Phyllomedusa\r\nannae_ (Duellman, 1963b), _Phrynohyas venulosa_ (Zweifel, 1964), and\r\n_Triprion petasatus_ (Duellman and Klaas, 1964).

Larval teeth are absent in hatchlings; the inner tooth-rows\r\ndevelop first, and the third lower row last. At metamorphosis the third\r\nlower row is the first to be lost. The tail increases gradually in\r\nlength relative to the body. In stage 25 the tail is 52.1 per cent of\r\nthe total length, and in stage 36, 64.6 per cent. In later stages the\r\ntail becomes relatively shorter through resorption. Duellman and Klaas\r\n(1964:320) noted a great size-variation in _Triprion_ tadpoles in stage\r\n25. No such variation is apparent in any stage of any of the species of\r\n_Smilisca_ studied.\r\n\r\nThe growth and development of the other species of _Smilisca_ do not\r\ndiffer significantly from that of _S. phaeota_. The tadpoles of _S.\r\nsila_ and _sordida_ from streams have relatively longer tails at\r\nhatching. For example, in tadpoles of _S. sordida_ the average length of\r\ntail is 64.0 per cent of the body-length in stage 25, and in stage 37,\r\n67.0 per cent.\r\n\r\n_Behavior_\r\n\r\nThe tadpoles of _S. baudini_, _cyanosticta_, _phaeota_, and _puma_ are\r\npelagic inhabitants of shallow ponds. Early stages of _S. baudini_ in\r\nwhich external gills are present have been observed to hang vertically\r\nwith the gills spread out at the surface of the water, a behavior noted\r\nby Zweifel (1964:206) in tadpoles of _Phrynohyas venulosa_, which also\r\ndevelop in warm, standing water having a relatively low oxygen-tension.\r\nWhen disturbed the pelagic tadpoles usually dive and seek shelter amidst\r\nvegetation or in mud on the bottom. This behavior was observed in _S.\r\nbaudini_, _cyanosticta_, and _phaeota_ by day and at night. No tadpoles\r\nof _S. puma_ were observed by day; those seen at night were near the\r\nsurface of small water-filled depressions in a grassy marsh; they\r\nresponded to light by taking refuge in the dense grass. Perhaps tadpoles\r\nof this species are negatively phototactic and remain hidden by day.\r\n\r\nThe stream-inhabiting tadpoles of _S. sila_ and _sordida_ live in clear\r\npools in rocky streams, where they were observed to cling by their\r\nmouths to rocks in the stream and to seek shelter amidst pebbles or\r\nbeneath rocks and leaves on the bottom. These tadpoles are not found in\r\nshallow riffles.\r\n\r\nWe have not found tadpoles of two species of _Smilisca_ in the same body\r\nof water and therefore cannot offer observations on ecological\r\nrelationships in sympatric situations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYLOGENETIC RELATIONSHIPS\r\n\r\n\r\nIdentifiable hylid remains are known from the Miocene to the Recent, but\r\nthese fossils are mostly fragmentary and provide little useful\r\ninformation regarding the phylogenetic relationships of living genera.\r\nFrogs of the genus _Smilisca_ are generalized and show no striking\r\nadaptations, either in their structure or in their modes of life\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n\r\nInterspecific Relationships\r\n\r\nIn attempting to understand the relationships of the species of\r\n_Smilisca_ we have emphasized osteological characters. The phylogeny\r\nsuggested by these characters is supported by other lines of evidence,\r\nincluding external morphology, tadpoles, and breeding calls.\r\n\r\nOur concept of the prototype of the genus _Smilisca_ is a moderate-sized\r\nhylid having: (1) a well-developed frontoparietal fontanelle,\r\n(2) frontoparietal lacking lateral processes, (3) no bony\r\nsquamosal-maxillary arch, (4) a fully ossified ethmoid, (5) paired\r\nsubgular vocal sac, (6) moderately webbed fingers and toes, (7)\r\nrelatively few supernumerary tubercles on the digits, (8) eggs deposited\r\nin clumps in ponds, (9) anteroventral mouth in tadpoles bordered by one\r\nrow of labial papillae, but median part of upper lip bare, (10) tail\r\nrelatively short and deep in tadpoles, and (11) a breeding call\r\nconsisting of a series of like notes.\r\n\r\nTwo phyletic lines evolved from this prototype. The first of these was\r\nthe stock that gave rise to the _baudini_ group. The evolutionary\r\nchanges that took place in this line included increase in size,\r\ndevelopment of a lateral curvature of the maxillary, and an increased\r\namount of cranial ossification, especially in the dermal roofing bones.\r\nThis phyletic line retained the larval characters and breeding call of\r\nthe prototype. The second phyletic line gave rise to the _sordida_ group\r\nand diverged from the prototype in the development of an angular\r\nmaxillary and a breeding call consisting of a primary note followed by\r\nsecondary notes. The frogs in this phyletic line retained the moderate\r\nsize of the prototype and did not develop additional dermal bone. Our\r\nconcept of the phylogenetic relationships is shown graphically in Figure\r\n17.\r\n\r\nWithin the _baudini_ group one stock retained separate nasals and did\r\nnot develop a bony squamosal-maxillary arch, but broad lateral processes\r\ndeveloped on the frontoparietals. The tadpoles remained unchanged from\r\nthe primitive type. This stock evolved into _S. phaeota_. In the other\r\nstock the nasals became fully ossified and a bony squamosal-maxillary\r\narch developed. One branch of this second stock retained tadpoles having\r\nonly one row of labial papillae and did not develop lateral processes on\r\nthe frontoparietals; this branch evolved into _S. cyanosticta_. The\r\nother branch diverged and gave rise to _S. baudini_ by developing\r\nrelatively shorter hind legs, large lateral processes on the\r\nfrontoparietals, and tadpoles having two rows of labial papillae.\r\n\r\nWithin the _sordida_ group the cranial features remained unchanged in\r\none line, which gave rise to _S. sila_, whereas in a second line the\r\nnasals were reduced, and their long axes shifted with the result that\r\nthey are not parallel to the maxillaries; the amount of ossification of\r\nthe ethmoid was reduced, and the tadpoles developed two rows of labial\r\npapillae. In this second line one branch retained the pond-breeding\r\nhabits and gave rise to _S. puma_, whereas a second branch became\r\nadapted to stream-breeding and gave rise to _S. sordida_.\r\n\r\n   _baudini_\r\n      \\   _cyanosticta_\r\n       \\ /\r\n        +    _phaeota_       _sordida_\r\n         \\  /               /\r\n           +        puma_  /\r\n            \\            \\/   _sila_\r\n             \\           /_____/\r\n              \\        /\r\n                \\    /\r\n                  \\ /\r\n                   |\r\n                   |\r\n                Prototype\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 17. Hypothesized phylogenetic relationships\r\n       of the species of _Smilisca_.]\r\n\r\nCertain aspects of this proposed phylogeny warrant further comment.\r\nFeatures such as the deposition of additional bone that roofs the skull\r\nor that forms lateral projections from the frontoparietals, like those\r\nin _S. baudini_ and _phaeota_, are minor alterations of dermal elements\r\nand not basic modifications of the architecture of the skull.\r\nConsequently, we hypothesize the independent development of these dermal\r\nchanges in _S. baudini_ and _phaeota_. Similar kinds of dermal\r\nmodifications have evolved independently in many diverse groups of\r\nfrogs.\r\n\r\nLikewise, we propose the parallel development of stream-adapted tadpoles\r\nin _S. sordida_ and _sila_; in both cases the tadpoles adapted to\r\nchanging environmental conditions (see following section on evolutionary\r\nhistory). Tadpoles of _S. sordida_ already had two rows of labial\r\npapillae before entering the streams; subsequently the tadpoles\r\ndeveloped complete rows of papillae, ventral mouths and long tails\r\nhaving low fins. Possibly the tadpoles of _S. sila_ had two rows of\r\nlabial papillae prior to their adapting to stream conditions; in the\r\nprocess of adapting they developed ventral mouths and long tails having\r\nlow fins. Similar modifications in tadpoles have occurred in many\r\ndiverse groups of Middle American hylids, such as _Plectrohyla_,\r\n_Ptychohyla_, the _Hyla uranochroa_ group, and the _Hyla taeniopus_\r\ngroup.\r\n\r\nOur lack of concern about coloration is due to the fact that, with the\r\nexception of the blue spots on the flanks and posterior surfaces of the\r\nthighs in some species, the coloration of _Smilisca_, consisting of a\r\npattern of irregular dark marks on a paler dorsum and dark transverse\r\nbars on the limbs, is not much different from that of many other\r\nNeotropical hylids. Blue is a structural color, rare among Amphibia,\r\nwhich is achieved by the absence of lipophores above the guanophores.\r\nThus, the incident light rays at the blue end of the spectrum are\r\nreflected by the guanophores without interference by an overlying yellow\r\nlipophore screen. According to Noble (1931), lipophores are capable of\r\namoeboid movement that permits shifts in their positions, between or\r\nbeneath the guanophores. We do not know whether this behavior of\r\nlipophores is widespread and is effected in response to environmental\r\nchanges, or whether it is a genetically controlled attribute that is\r\nrestricted in appearance. If the latter is the case we must assume that\r\nthe prototype of _Smilisca_ possessed such an attribute which was lost\r\nin _S. baudini_, _phaeota_, and _puma_. The development of blue spots is\r\nnot constant in _S. sordida_ and _S. sila_; in _S. cyanosticta_ the\r\nspots range in color from blue to pale green.\r\n\r\nThe coloration of the tadpoles is not distinctive, except for the\r\npresence of dorsal blotches on the tails of _S. sila_ and _sordida_.\r\nHowever, the similarity in pattern cannot be interpreted as indicating\r\nclose relationships because nearly identical patterns are present in\r\n_Hyla legleri_ and some species of _Prostherapis_. This disruptive\r\ncoloration seems to be directly associated with the pebble-bottom,\r\nstream-inhabiting tadpoles.\r\n\r\nIn the _baudini_ group, _S. phaeota_ and _cyanosticta_ are allopatric,\r\nwhereas _S. baudini_ occurs sympatrically with both of those species.\r\nThe call of _S. baudini_ differs notably from the calls of _S. phaeota_\r\nand _cyanosticta_, which are more nearly alike. Although in the\r\nphylogenetic scheme proposed here _S. sila_ is considered to be more\r\ndistantly related to _S. puma_ than is _S. sordida_, the calls of _S.\r\nsila_ and _puma_ more closely resemble one another than either resembles\r\nthat of _S. sordida_. _Smilisca sila_ and _puma_ are allopatric, whereas\r\n_S. sordida_ is broadly sympatric with both of those species. We assume\r\nthat in their respective phyletic lines the differentiation of both _S.\r\nbaudini_ and _sordida_ was the result of genetic changes in\r\ngeographically isolated populations. Subsequently, each species\r\ndispersed into areas inhabited by other members of their respective\r\ngroups. Selection for differences in the breeding calls helped to\r\nreinforce other differences in the populations and thereby aided in\r\nmaintaining specificity.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvolutionary History\r\n\r\nWith respect to temporal and spatial aspects of evolution in _Smilisca_,\r\nwe have tried to correlate the phylogenetic evidence on _Smilisca_ with\r\nthe geologic data on Middle America presented by Lloyd (1963), Vinson\r\nand Brineman (1963), Guzman and Cserna (1963), Maldonado-Koerdell\r\n(1964), and Whitmore and Stewart (1965). Likewise, we have borne in mind\r\nthe evidence for, and ideas about, the evolution of the Middle American\r\nherpetofauna given by Dunn (1931b), Schmidt (1943), Stuart (1950, 1964)\r\nDuellman (1958, MS), and Savage (MS).\r\n\r\nAccording to Stuart's (1950) historical arrangement of the herpetofauna,\r\n_Smilisca_ is a member of the Autochthonous Middle American Faunal\r\nElement, and according to Savage's (MS) arrangement the genus belongs to\r\nthe Middle American Element, a fauna which was derived from a\r\ngeneralized tropical American unit that was isolated in tropical North\r\nAmerica by the inundation of the Isthmian Link in early Tertiary, that\r\ndeveloped _in situ_ in tropical North America, and that was restricted\r\nto Middle America by climatic change in the late Cenozoic.\r\n\r\nSavage (MS) relied on the paleogeographic maps of Lloyd (1963) to\r\nhypothesize the extent and centers of differentiation of the Middle\r\nAmerican Faunal Element. According to Lloyd's concept, Middle America in\r\nthe Miocene consisted of a broad peninsula extending southeastward to\r\nabout central Nicaragua, separated from the Panamanian Spur of\r\ncontinental South America by shallow seas. A large island, the Talamanca\r\nRange, and remnants of the Guanarivas Ridge formed an archipelago in the\r\nshallow sea. The recent discovery of remains of mammals having definite\r\nNorth American affinities in the Miocene of the Canal Zone (Whitmore and\r\nStewart, 1965) provides substantial evidence that at least a peninsula\r\nwas continuous southeastward from Nuclear Central America to the area of\r\nthe present Canal Zone in early mid-Miocene time. South America was\r\nisolated from Central America by the Bolivar Trough until late\r\nmid-Pliocene.\r\n\r\nThus, in the mid-Tertiary the broad peninsula of Nuclear Central\r\nAmerica, which consisted of low and moderately uplifted regions having a\r\ntropical mesic climate, provided the site for the evolution of\r\n_Smilisca_. It is not possible to determine when the genus evolved, but\r\nto explain the differentiation of the species it is unnecessary to have\r\nthe ancestral _Smilisca_ present prior to the Miocene.\r\n\r\nWe view the Miocene _Smilisca_ as the prototype described in the\r\npreceding section, and suppose that it lived in the mesic tropical\r\nenvironment of the eastern part of the Central American Peninsula (in\r\nwhat is now Costa Rica and western Panama). Two stocks differentiated,\r\nprobably in middle Miocene times; one of these, the ancestral stock of\r\nthe _baudini_ group, was widespread on the Caribbean lowlands from the\r\nNicaraguan Depression to the Bolivar Trough, and the other, the\r\nancestral stock of the _sordida_ group, was restricted to the Pacific\r\nlowlands of the same region. In late Miocene time the ancestral stock of\r\nthe _baudini_ group dispersed northwestward around the deep embayment in\r\nthe Nicaraguan depression into upper Central America (in what is now\r\nHonduras and Guatemala) and thence into southern Mexico. Apparently\r\ndifferentiation took place on each side of the Nicaraguan Depression;\r\nthe frogs to the south of the depression evolved into _S. phaeota_,\r\nwhereas those to the north of the depression represented the stock from\r\nwhich _S. baudini_ and _cyanosticta_ arose. Prior to the uplift of the\r\nmountains in the late Miocene and the Pliocene the _baudini-cyanosticta_\r\nstock probably was widespread in northwestern Central America. The\r\nelevation of the mountains resulted in notable climatic changes,\r\nprincipally the development of sub-humid environments on the Pacific\r\nlowlands. The frogs living on the Pacific lowlands became adapted to\r\nsub-humid conditions and developed into _S. baudini_. The stock on the\r\nCaribbean lowlands remained in mesic environments and evolved into _S.\r\ncyanosticta_.\r\n\r\nPossibly in the middle Miocene before the Talamanca Range in Costa Rica\r\nand western Panama was greatly uplifted, the ancestral stock of the\r\n_sordida_ group invaded the Caribbean lowlands of what is now Costa\r\nRica. The subsequent elevation of the Talamanca Range in the Pliocene\r\neffectively isolated the ancestral stock of _S. sila_ on the Pacific\r\nlowlands from the _puma-sordida_ stock on the Caribbean lowlands. The\r\nformer was subjected to the sub-humid conditions which developed on the\r\nPacific lowlands when the Talamanca Range was uplifted. It adapted to\r\nthe sub-humid environment by living along streams and evolving\r\nstream-adapted tadpoles. On the Caribbean side of the Talamanca Range\r\nthe _puma-sordida_ stock inhabited mesic environments. The stock that\r\nevolved into _S. puma_ remained in the lowlands as a pond-breeding frog,\r\nwhereas those frogs living on the slopes of the newly elevated mountains\r\nbecame adapted for their montane existence by developing stream-adapted\r\ntadpoles and thus differentiated into _S. sordida_.\r\n\r\nProbably the six species of _Smilisca_ were in existence by the end of\r\nthe Pliocene; at that time a continuous land connection existed from\r\nCentral America to South America. The climatic fluctuations in the\r\nPleistocene, and the post-Wisconsin development of present climatic and\r\nvegetational patterns in Middle America, brought about the present\r\npatterns of distribution of the species. From its place of origin on the\r\nCaribbean lowlands of lower Central America, _S. phaeota_ dispersed\r\nnorthward into Nicaragua and southward along the Pacific slopes of\r\nnorthwestern South America. Perhaps in the late Pleistocene or in\r\npost-Wisconsin time when mesic conditions were more widespread than now,\r\n_S. phaeota_ moved onto the Pacific lowlands of Costa Rica. Its route\r\ncould have been through the Arenal Depression. Subsequent aridity\r\nrestricted its range on the Pacific lowlands to the Golfo Dulce region.\r\nClimatic fluctuation in northern Central America restricted the\r\ndistribution of _S. cyanosticta_ to mesic habitats on the slopes of the\r\nMexican and Guatemalan highlands and to certain humid areas on the\r\nlowlands. _Smilisca baudini_ was well adapted to sub-humid conditions,\r\nand the species dispersed northward to the Rio Grande Embayment and to\r\nthe edge of the Sonoran Desert and southward into Costa Rica. In\r\nsouthern Mexico and Central America the species invaded mesic habitats.\r\nConsequently, in some areas it is sympatric with _S. cyanosticta_ and\r\n_phaeota_.\r\n\r\n_Smilisca puma_ dispersed northward onto the Caribbean lowlands of\r\nsouthern Nicaragua. Its southward movements probably were limited by the\r\nridges of the Talamanca Range that extend to the Caribbean coast in the\r\narea of Punta Cahuita in Costa Rica. _Smilisca sila_ dispersed along the\r\nPacific lowlands and slopes of the mountains from eastern Costa Rica and\r\nwestern Panama through eastern Panama to northern Colombia. Climatic\r\nfluctuation in the Pleistocene evidently provided sufficient altitudinal\r\nshifts in environments in the Talamanca Range to permit _S. sordida_ to\r\nmove onto the Pacific slopes. From its upland distribution the species\r\nfollowed streams down to both the Caribbean and Pacific lowlands, where\r\nit is sympatric with _S. puma_ on the Caribbean lowlands and _S. sila_\r\non the Pacific lowlands.\r\n\r\nThe evolution of the species-groups of _Smilisca_ was effected through\r\nisolation by physical barriers in the Cenozoic; the differentiation of\r\nthe species was initiated by further isolation of populations by changes\r\nin physiography and climate. Present patterns of distribution resulted\r\nfrom Pleistocene and post-Wisconsin climatic changes. Today, sympatric\r\nspecies have different breeding habits and breeding calls which\r\nreinforce the differences in morphology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe genus _Smilisca_ is composed of six species of tree frogs; each\r\nspecies is defined on the basis of adult morphology, larval characters,\r\nand breeding behavior. Keys are provided to aid in the identification of\r\nadults and of tadpoles.\r\n\r\nAnalysis of the characters and examination of type specimens indicates\r\nthat several currently-recognized taxa are synonymous, as follows:\r\n\r\n  1. _Hyla beltrani_ Taylor, 1942 = _Smilisca baudini_.\r\n  2. _Hyla gabbi_ Cope, 1876 = _Smilisca sordida_.\r\n  3. _Hyla manisorum_ Taylor, 1954 = _Smilisca baudini_.\r\n  4. _Hyla nigripes_ Cope, 1876 = _Smilisca sordida_.\r\n  5. _Hyla wellmanorum_ Taylor, 1952 = _Smilisca puma_.\r\n\r\n_Smilisca phaeota cyanosticta_ Smith, 1953 is elevated to specific rank,\r\nand one new species, _Smilisca sila_, is named and described.\r\n\r\nThe skeletal system of developmental stages and the adult of _Smilisca\r\nbaudini_ is described, and the skull is compared with that of other\r\nmembers of the genus.\r\n\r\nThe tadpoles are described, compared, and illustrated; the larval\r\ndevelopment of _Smilisca phaeota_ is described.\r\n\r\nBreeding behavior and breeding calls are described and compared. Some\r\nspecies of _Smilisca_ have breeding choruses. Two species, _S. sila_ and\r\n_sordida_, breed in streams, whereas the others breed in ponds.\r\n\r\nThe genus is considered to be part of the Middle American Faunal\r\nElement; the species are thought to have differentiated in response to\r\necological diversity and historical opportunities provided by Cenozoic\r\nchanges in physiography and climate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERATURE CITED\r\n\r\n\r\nBAIRD, S.
