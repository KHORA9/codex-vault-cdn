FLETT, M.A., LL.D., F.R.S.\r\n\r\n  _Of the Geological Survey of Scotland_\r\n\r\n  EDINBURGH\r\n  OLIVER AND BOYD\r\n  LONDON: GURNEY & JACKSON, 33 PATERNOSTER ROW\r\n  1917\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThis biography of Prof. James Geikie is based upon his own letters,\r\npapers, and diaries, and upon information supplied by many of those who\r\nwere closely associated with him, both during his earlier days on the\r\nGeological Survey and the later in Edinburgh. Much of the material was\r\nsorted and arranged by Mrs Geikie before it was placed in my hands, and\r\nto her I am indebted for many notes, memoranda, and verbal statements\r\nwhich supplemented the documents supplied. Mrs Geikie had herself\r\ncomposed, for the use of the family, a brief account of her husband’s\r\nearly days, and on this manuscript the first chapter is largely based;\r\nwithout its aid the composition of that chapter would have been very\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\nFor later years I am under great obligations to Prof. Geikie’s many\r\nfriends and correspondents, at home and abroad. Correspondents across\r\nthe seas, especially, deserve warm thanks for their willingness\r\nto trust valuable original documents to the post, at a time when\r\nthe phrase “perils of the sea” had taken on a new meaning. It is\r\nsatisfactory to be able to state that in no case was such material lost\r\nas a result of hostile action. Prof. Stevenson of New York and Prof.\r\nChamberlin of Chicago must be specially mentioned as having supplied\r\nmuch material. It should perhaps be added that the circumstances under\r\nwhich the book was written made it impossible to obtain letters or\r\ninformation from many continental geologists, who, in happier times,\r\nwould doubtless have been glad to render assistance.\r\n\r\nA large amount of material was also kindly supplied by geologists and\r\nothers in this country. Among those who have taken a keen interest\r\nin the progress of the work, and have rendered notable assistance,\r\nmention may be made of the following friends and correspondents of\r\nProf. Geikie:--Dr John Horne, who supplied many letters and much\r\ndetailed information--to his kindly and unfailing help this memoir\r\nof his old friend owes much; Dr Peach, whose accounts of early days\r\non the Survey were most helpful; Mr Lionel Hinxman, Mr H. M. Cadell,\r\nand many others, to whom application was made in regard to matters\r\nof detail. Among the last mention may be made of Dr W. B. Blaikie of\r\nMessrs T. & A. Constable, Mr T. S. Muir of the Royal High School, and\r\nMr John Grossart. To all who have rendered assistance I desire to offer\r\nmost cordial thanks, and trust that they and others will feel that\r\nthe biographical sketch, in however imperfect a fashion, does present\r\na lifelike picture of one who rarely failed to inspire affection and\r\nadmiration in those who came to close quarters with him.\r\n\r\n  MARION I.

He\r\nwas the third son and the third child in a family of eight, consisting\r\nof five sons and three daughters, and was baptised as James Murdoch\r\nGeikie. He abolished--to use his own word--the Murdoch in boyhood.\r\n\r\nHis father was in business in Edinburgh, but by taste and inclination\r\nwas a musician, and in later years, after retiring from business,\r\ndevoted himself entirely to music, and was the author of a number of\r\ncompositions, sacred and secular. A little anecdote, recalled by his\r\nson in later years, suggests that it had always been his ambition to\r\nbe a professional musician, and that he had been thwarted in youth.\r\nThe story relates that one day he said to James somewhat sadly:--“If\r\never you have a son who wants to make music his profession, do not\r\noppose his wish.” In the fulness of time, it is interesting to note,\r\none of James Geikie’s sons did express this desire, and his father\r\nscrupulously observed the injunction of the long-dead grandfather. The\r\npoint is not without importance, from more than one aspect, and is at\r\nleast a partial refutation of the pessimists who, like Samuel Butler,\r\nmaintain that each generation repeats the mistakes of the last in\r\ndealing with youth.\r\n\r\nAnother artistic strain in the family was represented in the person of\r\nWalter Geikie, an uncle, who was a well-known painter of Scotch scenes\r\nand left also some good etchings. Of him James Geikie, in an undated\r\nfragment of what was apparently intended to be a history of the family,\r\nsays:--“Of my Uncle Walter I will say nothing: the Life prefixed to\r\nhis etchings having already forestalled anything I could tell. He was\r\na capital mimic and possessed of boundless good nature. Had he been\r\nlonger spared he might well have become famous in his profession, but\r\nDeath, to whom the genius and the numbskull are one and the same,\r\ncarried him off in the year 1837--two years before I was born.” James,\r\nit may be noted here, had himself considerable skill as a draughtsman,\r\nas both his published works and his geological note-books show clearly,\r\nwhich adds interest to this note upon his artist uncle. Another uncle,\r\nwho was a minister and went out to the United States when James was\r\nyoung, was the father of Cunningham Geikie the divine, author of a\r\nwidely-read _Life of Christ_.\r\n\r\nThe latter lived with the Geikie family in Edinburgh for some time in\r\nhis student days. The MS. from which the above quotation is made,\r\nwhich is annotated in pencil by its author, is, as stated, a mere\r\nfragment and undated. Internal evidence, however, suggests that it may\r\nhave been written about 1856, the writing and composition recalling\r\nsome extant letters of this period, and it shows, as further quotations\r\nwill indicate, that its author, with all his obvious immaturity, was\r\neven then feeling after a style.\r\n\r\nJames Geikie’s mother was a Miss Thom, a daughter of a merchant\r\ncaptain, who was born in Inverness but established himself at Dunbar.\r\nHere he married the daughter of a local shipbuilder, whose family was\r\nconnected by marriage--to quote again the MS. already mentioned--with\r\n“that Roderick MacKenzie who suffered his head to be taken from him\r\nthat he might save that of Prince Charles Stewart”; a fact of which\r\nthe boy James confesses himself very proud. In his later days Captain\r\nThom often visited his married daughter, and the important part which\r\nhe played in developing the imagination of the children is suggested\r\nin the following sentences (from MS.):--“My Grandfather Thom when I\r\nfirst knew him had not ceased to plough the sea for his living. He was\r\nof a middle stature, well-made, and muscular. I can still see his fine\r\nhead nearly bald--what hair he had was of a beautiful silver white--his\r\nRoman nose. I can still at this late period follow him in his walks.\r\nI see him sitting with his old cronies--relics of fights by land and\r\nsea--on that seat between the two old trees--long since pulled down to\r\nmake way for those improvements, so-called, which have altered entirely\r\nwhat in my young days went by the name of ‘The Meadows.’ His stories\r\nof adventures with the robbers of the sea are rife in my memory. His\r\nvoyages to places whose very names smack of fairy-land--his hairbreadth\r\nescapes--his deeds of daring--the recollection of all these rises\r\nvividly before me at the mere mention of his name. I looked upon him\r\nas another Sinbad--a second Robinson Crusoe; and my acquaintance with\r\nhis queer old friends served to heighten the romantic colours in which\r\nI viewed him! Alas! all these school-boy dreamings are past; but they\r\nwill sometimes flit before me as I lie gazing up into the deep blue\r\nof a summer sky, recalling the old days which have gone away into dim\r\nforgetfulness: and they will sometimes come again as I sit alone musing\r\nby the winter fireside. Verily there is a something--call it what you\r\nwill--about the past which renders it infinitely more endearing to us\r\nthan all the brightest dreams of the future.”\r\n\r\nThe only comment which it is necessary to make upon the above is\r\nto repeat that it was apparently written when the boy was about\r\nseventeen, and thus, as we shall see, at a period when he was engaged\r\nin uncongenial work, and when his future was uncertain: these facts\r\nhelp to explain what the James Geikie of a later day would have\r\ncontemptuously denounced as the “high-falutin” style.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the visits of Captain Thom to Edinburgh, family\r\nintercourse was kept up by return visits of the children to Dunbar,\r\nwhere the ships appealed strongly to the imagination of James. He was\r\nfond of saying in later years that he used to watch them dipping below\r\nthe horizon and longed to follow them to see what lay beyond; and the\r\n_Wanderlust_, so early developed, lasted till the end of life. In a\r\nletter to one of his sons, written to Egypt in 1901, he says:--“Old man\r\ntho’ I am, I’m just as keen to knock about the world as ever I was. It\r\nis like renewing my youth even to think about it!”\r\n\r\nIn connection with the seafarer’s blood which he inherited from\r\nhis mother’s side, it is also of interest to note that James was an\r\nexcellent traveller both by sea and land; the sea had no terrors for\r\nhim, and his voyages were a source of continuous pleasure, both at the\r\ntime and in recollection.\r\n\r\nAs to his immediate intellectual heritage, it seems probable that James\r\ntook the majority of his qualities from his father’s side. But his\r\nmother, of whom he was very fond, was a woman of great ability and much\r\nambition for her clever sons, whom she spurred on in their careers. Her\r\nextraordinary skill as a needlewoman, and her capacity for hard work,\r\nare enshrined in the family traditions, and it is probable that James\r\ntook from her his remarkable perseverance and his manual dexterity.\r\nThe father was full of _bonhomie_, probably as deeply impregnated as\r\nhis son with the _joie de vivre_, and like him more desirous of a full\r\nlife than given to the narrow concentration which achieves a particular\r\npurpose at the expense of so much.\r\n\r\nFrom his father James seems to have inherited his imagination and\r\nthe touch of constructive genius which enabled him to do such\r\nnoteworthy work; but one can well believe that the instinct which led\r\nthe son to interleave his scientific observations in his geological\r\nnote-books with verses, prevented the father from devoting himself as\r\nwhole-heartedly to the pursuit of worldly prosperity as his wife may\r\nhave thought desirable in view of the large and growing family.\r\n\r\nIt is at least certain that money was not very abundant in the early\r\ndays, though the house contained many books, and there seems to have\r\nbeen much music and liveliness, the father, like the son, being a\r\ncapital story-teller. He must also have been a traveller in his day,\r\nfor James in a letter to his brother William speaks of him as going off\r\nto the Continent in 1858, a much rarer adventure for a man of moderate\r\nmeans then than now. The occasion was a musical festival at Bonn, and\r\nwas apparently taken advantage of to the full, the tour being extended\r\nto Paris and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nDetails in regard to the early life of James Geikie are scanty. These\r\nwere days long before the time when conscientious parents recorded in\r\nneatly kept note-books all details as to the growth and development\r\nof their offspring; while with babies following each other at regular\r\nintervals throughout a long period of years, the mother had probably\r\nlittle time to put on record any signs of precocity in the elder\r\nboys, if such existed. Two little stories, however, emphasise the\r\nstatements made above as to the effect on the children’s imagination\r\nof Captain Thom’s yarns. When very small James, in company with his\r\nbrother William, who was two years older, set off to walk down to\r\nJoppa, some three and a half miles from Edinburgh, to see the world,\r\nand incidentally to visit an aunt who lived in the district. The two\r\narrived very tired, only, after a meal and a rest, to be ignominiously\r\ntaken home again by their aunt. In those days communications between\r\nthe shore and the city were difficult, and the party had to trudge back\r\non foot, the small James, whose ambition on this occasion had somewhat\r\noutrun his strength, having to be carried most of the way.\r\n\r\nBut this inglorious finale did not quench the ardour of the youthful\r\npair, who were probably slow to grasp the attitude of grown-up people\r\ntowards displays of initiative on the part of the young. Next time\r\nthey planned to make a voyage on their own account, and to place the\r\nwater between them and over-zealous family affection. They were so\r\nfar successful as to reach Leith and find their way on board a ship.\r\nBut alas! even here they were met by a display of the adult passion\r\nfor interference, and were taken home by a sailor who, regardless of\r\nthe soul within, maintained that their diminutive stature debarred\r\nthem from seeking life and adventure on the high seas. As one of the\r\ngrandfather’s most popular stories related how he had sunk a pirate\r\nboat in the Bay of Naples, by means of a small gun loaded with scrap\r\niron, and how in consequence he had been fêted by the Neapolitans, and\r\nhad had his portrait painted, one can imagine that the brothers were\r\nvery bitter at this second check to their own ambitions. James had to\r\nwait many years before he faced Italian pirates and brigands, and then\r\nit was the milder variety which requires to be treated with another\r\nmetal rather than iron, and cannot be disposed of by Captain Thom’s\r\nsummary methods.\r\n\r\nAnother story of childhood is interesting because it shows how\r\ncompletely the boy was the father of the man. At some unknown\r\nbut early date he had a serious illness. So desperate seemed his\r\ncondition that the doctor, speaking in the presence of the apparently\r\nunconscious boy, permitted himself to tell the mother that recovery\r\nwas practically impossible, and was not to be desired, as the child\r\nwould be feeble-minded. After the doctor had left, the poor mother came\r\nback into the room crying, but little Jamie found strength to whisper\r\nfeebly: “I’ll no dee yet, mother.”\r\n\r\nLong years afterwards, in a bad illness some four or five years before\r\nhis death, somewhat similar incidents happened. One day after he had\r\nseen the doctor exchange a grave glance with the nurse, he managed,\r\nafter the doctor had left the room, to say: “Tell him I have a return\r\nticket.” On another occasion one sick-room attendant volunteered to\r\nanother the statement that she did not think the professor would last\r\ntill the morning, and was considerably startled to hear the apparently\r\ndying man, who was lying with his eyes closed, say distinctly, if\r\nfeebly, “The professor will last till the morning, and he’ll last\r\ntill he sees you out of the house.” Needless to say he did more than\r\nthis, for he lived to tell the tale with his old glee and vivacity.\r\nPerhaps the medical science of a later date will be able to find an\r\nexplanation of this power of resistance, and of its association with\r\nthe nervous temperament rather than with strong physique. Meantime it\r\nis interesting to have another confirmation of the frequent experience\r\nthat in a death-struggle, whether with internal or external foes, the\r\n“muscular Christian” can often give a less good account of himself than\r\nthe nervous one. The boy, who if he lived was to be feeble-minded, not\r\nonly lived but added notably to the world’s stock of knowledge.\r\n\r\nOnly one early letter has been preserved, and it gives no clue as to\r\nits date, beyond the fact that it is printed in childish capitals,\r\nwhich are, however, wonderfully straight, and shows an uncharacteristic\r\nuncertainty as to spelling. It reads:--\r\n\r\n\r\n DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER,--We are very much disappointed, at youre\r\n not leaving London on Saturday. We hopet to have the pleasure of\r\n seeing you pull down the pears for us but since you have not come,\r\n we will have to bigin ourselves and take them down. We are all in\r\n good health we wer all up at the castle with Thom to day and saw Mons\r\n Meg. Write us soon and let us know when yoo ar really to leave.--Your\r\n affectionate son,\r\n\r\n  JAMES M. GEIKIE.\r\n\r\n\r\nJames Geikie’s early education was obtained at a private school,\r\nwhere he seems to have been unhappy. The master was brutal in his\r\nmethods, and ill-suited to have charge of a delicate, nervous boy.\r\nThe climax came when one day he approached James from behind, and\r\nseized his ear roughly between his finger and thumb, giving it a\r\npainful wrench. The boy, maddened with pain and fright, sprang up,\r\nand seizing the nearest object, which happened to be an inkpot, flung\r\nit at his assailant. He then made for the door, his exit closing one\r\neducational chapter. Afterwards, in 1850, when he was eleven years of\r\nage, he went to Edinburgh High School, then under the rectorship of Dr\r\nSchmitz. Here James Geikie seems to have distinguished himself chiefly\r\nin classics. The classical master was Dr Boyd, who evidently perceived\r\nhis abilities, for he told him that he expected to hear of him in later\r\nyears either as a poet or as a literary man.\r\n\r\nUnder Dr Boyd James Geikie gained a prize for a translation from\r\nVirgil into English verse, and his knack of verse-making seems to have\r\nbeen carefully fostered. A number of his verse translations have been\r\npreserved, some written out in his brother William’s extraordinarily\r\nneat hand, others printed by James himself at a later date.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, however, it would seem as though the education of the\r\nboys was carried out more outside school than in it. In those days\r\nScottish schools were unaffected by English traditions in the matter of\r\nsport. There were no organised games, and the boys obtained exercise\r\nin whatever way pleased them best. The Geikie children kept many pets\r\nin their garden, and James’s considerable manual dexterity was often\r\ncalled upon in connection with the welfare of these. A family tradition\r\nled the children to give those of their pets who died before their\r\ntime an elaborate funeral, and James’s skill in coffin-making is still\r\nlauded by the remaining members of his family.\r\n\r\nOf more importance for his future career were the long excursions by\r\nwhich the boys as they grew satisfied their _Wanderlust_. Edinburgh\r\nis, of course, even to-day singularly favoured by Nature in the number\r\nand variety of the possible excursions within easy reach of the town,\r\nand in those days conditions were still better. In later years, when\r\nhe took his geological students over Arthur’s Seat, James Geikie used\r\noften to lament what he regarded as the spoiling of that park by the\r\nconstruction of roads, which for him took away the feeling of wildness,\r\nand part of the impressiveness of the wonderful volcanic scenery. He\r\ndid not live to see a further stage in which the citizens were shut off\r\nby the exigencies of war from the enjoyment of the most attractive part\r\nof the park.\r\n\r\nA little anecdote that he often also told on his excursions is not\r\nwithout interest. As a boy he was lying on the hill one day reading a\r\nbook when he was accosted by a party consisting of a tall gentleman, a\r\nlittle lady, and a group of children. The gentleman asked the way to\r\nthe top of the hill, and James not only volunteered to guide them, but\r\nultimately carried the smallest girl pickaback up part of the climb.\r\nThe party had a pleasant stroll, and parted the best of friends. As\r\nthe boy came down the slopes towards Holyrood, however, he found a\r\nconsiderable crowd waiting, and learnt that his help had been asked by\r\nthe Prince Consort, that the lady was Queen Victoria, and the little\r\ngirl he had carried the Princess Alice.\r\n\r\nOne motive for the long holiday rambles seems to have been\r\nbutterfly-collecting, if one may judge from the enthusiasm with\r\nwhich in later years, when himself the father of growing boys, he\r\nentered into the pursuit for their sakes. Some of his letters written\r\nto his sons during his travels on the Continent and in America are\r\nthoroughly boy-like in their enthusiasm for the beautiful creatures,\r\nand in their descriptions of the efforts necessary to obtain perfect\r\nspecimens. But like many an Edinburgh boy before and since, he was\r\nkeenly interested in fossils and in the rocks and minerals represented\r\nin the neighbourhood of his native town. Fossil-hunting expeditions to\r\nthe famous limestone quarries of Burdiehouse and Gilmerton, and to the\r\ncoprolitic shales down on the shore at Wardie, were often undertaken in\r\ncompany with two future colleagues on the Geological Survey--his eldest\r\nbrother Archibald, later Director of the Geological Survey, and now Sir\r\nArchibald Geikie, and the boy who afterwards became Prof. John Young of\r\nGlasgow. James was considerably younger than either, and, as he himself\r\nindicates in a Memoir prefixed to Dr Young’s _Essays and Addresses_\r\n(1904), was only allowed to accompany his seniors occasionally and as\r\na special favour. Indeed, throughout all this early period it seems\r\nclear that “Jamie” was only a little boy, not of great account in a\r\nfamily whose hopes were concentrated on the eldest son. The latter\r\nseems to have settled his own career early, for it is recorded that\r\none day while walking up the South Bridge with his little brother, he\r\nsaid:--“Do you see that big building with the iron gates? I am going in\r\nthere, and one day I shall be a professor there.” The little brother’s\r\nfeelings at the time are not recorded, but it seems probable that no\r\none in the family contemplated that the great iron gates would open for\r\nhim also as a professor.\r\n\r\nWith two older brothers, and two more following after, it is not to\r\nbe wondered at that James Geikie’s school-days soon ended. In 1853 he\r\nleft the High School, and at the beginning of 1854 was apprenticed to\r\nMr Thomas Constable, the printer. His life here does not seem to have\r\nbeen happy. The confinement and long hours did not suit his health,\r\nthe occupation did not appeal to his tastes, and among his chief\r\nconsolations seem to have been occasional geologising holidays and\r\nbooks. These he read on his way to and from his work, for the family\r\nby this time lived on the other side of what, despite the past tense\r\nof the MS. quoted on p. 6, is still called The Meadows, and this open\r\nspace had to be crossed daily.\r\n\r\nIn October 1855, however, his brother Archibald joined the Geological\r\nSurvey, and this, which opened a possible avenue of escape for James,\r\nthen only sixteen, marked an important turning-point in his career.\r\nOf the period as printer it is only necessary to add that, much as he\r\ndisliked it at the time, he was fond of saying in later years that it\r\nwas a useful experience, for it gave him a knowledge of the routine\r\nof printing work which stood him in good stead in his own constant\r\nproof-reading.\r\n\r\nHe stayed at Constable’s till the summer of 1858, and some letters to\r\nhis brother William have been preserved which give interesting glimpses\r\nof his character in this period of drudgery and development. William\r\nhad gone out to relatives of the family in the United States, and the\r\nletters were written to him there. His death, it may be noted, took\r\nplace as the result of an accident, shortly after the date of the last\r\nof the letters. Some extracts from them may be quoted:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  HOPE PARK, _31st Dec. 1856_.\r\n\r\n I have met with very little in my daily routine, since I went to\r\n Constable’s, that could entertain you, and will therefore skip over\r\n my past years and come to the _pint_, as Cousin Archie used to say.\r\n When you left you’ll remember I was still _daidlin’ mong drudgery_.\r\n I had to do so for a good while after that, till so it chanced I\r\n was _promoted_ to a _frame_. I got on pretty well, considering\r\n the long hours, and badly ventilated room, which were playing the\r\n very mischief with my health, so I hung on (if you’ll excuse the\r\n expression) until summer had come with its usual slackness in trade,\r\n and then I got rest. But summer, alas! like everything beneath the\r\n sun, is perishable, and so the crows’ nests began to peer through the\r\n thinly clad trees once more, and autumn coming sighing and weeping,\r\n but bringing with her, as her recompense and consolation, the richly\r\n laden field and the clear cloudless moon.... Well I went back to the\r\n office, and winter, and spring, and summer and autumn passed away, and\r\n “the new year’s coming up” (of which I wish you and all the _natives_\r\n very many happy returns), and here I am at home away from the office\r\n again. The late hours (9 to 10) have knocked me _up_ (or, as you are\r\n a bit of a Yankee, “_down_” if you like) and I have got leave for a\r\n week or two, which I intend spending with Archie. He, the Professor,\r\n delivered a lecture at Penicuik the other day on the “_Geology of the\r\n District_.”\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Aug. 1858._\r\n\r\n I am home at present on the sick list, and it is not likely I’ll be\r\n back to office before the end of autumn. We have glorious weather here\r\n at present,--and if I go to the country I have not the slightest doubt\r\n but I’ll enjoy myself. B----’s master has failed; but the General is\r\n not as yet out of his employment altho’ he expects soon to be so.\r\n I wish I were out of mine; I verily believe it will land me in a\r\n premature grave. It never has agreed with me.\r\n\r\n Mother is anxious to go off to the country with me. We are just\r\n looking about for a place. Perhaps Melrose or Lanark, but lodgings in\r\n both places are dear. I go at any rate with Archie next month to Fife;\r\n to be located probably at Aberdour; where I will be able to prosecute\r\n my geological studies, for I hope, if I am spared, to be able to join\r\n the Survey.--My dear Willie I will now close. I never forget you nor\r\n ever shall. You become all the dearer the further and longer you are\r\n away. God grant that we meet again on earth, if not we are always sure\r\n of meeting in a far better place.--I am your affect. brother,\r\n\r\n  JAMIE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe gloomy prognostication that his work at the printer’s office would\r\nland him in a premature grave was not fulfilled, but the statement\r\nhelps to explain why he left the work in the same year as that in which\r\nthe letter was written, having apparently never returned to the office\r\nafter writing it. In order to leave he broke his apprenticeship, and\r\nthis was strongly opposed by his employer, who told him that a man who\r\nchanged his profession would never succeed, a prophecy--in any case\r\nsomewhat extreme--which was not fulfilled in this case.\r\n\r\nBut after leaving the printing-works there was still another interval\r\nof waiting before the boy settled down to his life-work, and found his\r\nvocation. He did not finally enter the Survey till October 1861, a few\r\nmonths after his lifelong friend Dr Young. The period of waiting was\r\nspent partly at the University, where he attended among other classes\r\nProf. Allman’s natural history course, a subject with which geology was\r\nthen united. He was also in a lawyer’s office for a time, while waiting\r\nfor a vacancy on the Geological Survey.\r\n\r\nTo enter this he had to pass what was called a “Qualifying\r\nExamination,” which then included what the profane called Civil Service\r\n“tots.” These were long sums in compound addition, which had to be done\r\nwithin a limited time and with great accuracy. Though the operation\r\nbecame more or less mechanical to those who practised it assiduously,\r\nit presented considerable difficulties to those who were not accustomed\r\nto such work, especially when, like James Geikie, the victim had not\r\nwhat are called “business” instincts. The difficulties were, however,\r\novercome, and in October 1861, as already stated, he entered the\r\nGeological Survey, forming a member of the small Scottish staff, which\r\nconsisted of Messrs H. H. Howell, Archibald Geikie, Dr Young, and\r\nhimself, with the addition, a few months later, of Mr (now Dr) B. N.\r\nPeach. Of this band only Sir Archibald Geikie and Dr Peach now survive.\r\n\r\nWith this appointment to the Survey the period of uncertainty and\r\nwaiting ended, and James Geikie, at the age of twenty-two, entered on\r\nhis life-work, and henceforth found his way clear before him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nFIRST YEARS ON THE GEOLOGICAL SURVEY\r\n\r\n1862-1864\r\n\r\n\r\nJames Geikie was connected with the Geological Survey for a period of\r\ntwenty years, for he only gave up the work, with great reluctance, on\r\nhis appointment to the Murchison Chair of Geology in the University of\r\nEdinburgh in the year 1881. It seems only fitting, therefore, that some\r\ngeneral account of his life while a member of its staff should precede\r\nany detailed description of the occupations of the successive years.\r\nThe Survey years were singularly happy ones, were perhaps the most\r\nfruitful in original work, and definitely determined the whole future\r\ncourse of his life.\r\n\r\nFrom the official standpoint the tale of events is soon told. In 1861\r\nhe was appointed Assistant Geologist. Six years later, when for the\r\nfirst time the Scottish Survey was organised as a branch separate from\r\nthe English one, he was made one of the two geologists of the staff.\r\nTwo years later, that is in 1869, he was promoted to be District\r\nSurveyor, which made him second in position after the Director, who\r\nwas then his brother Archibald. The post of District Surveyor he\r\nheld till 1881, when the posts of Director and the Professorship at\r\nEdinburgh became simultaneously vacant by the promotion of his brother.\r\nIt was intimated that the two appointments would not again be combined,\r\nand, though as stated with great reluctance, James gave up the Survey\r\nto take the Chair.\r\n\r\nOf great interest in its effect upon his future work was a change\r\nin the policy of the Survey which practically synchronised with his\r\nappointment. Previous to this time, the loose superficial deposits in\r\nScotland had been ignored by the surveyors, who confined themselves\r\nto mapping the solid geology, _i.e._, the actual rocks, which in many\r\nparts of Scotland are mantled by a thick covering of drift or peat.\r\nIt was decided, chiefly on economic grounds, especially in connection\r\nwith agriculture, that not only should these superficial deposits be in\r\nfuture mapped along with the solid geology, but that the areas already\r\nsurveyed should be re-mapped, with the object of adding the omitted\r\nbeds. As already stated, Dr Young and James Geikie joined the Survey in\r\n1861, and Mr Peach at the beginning of 1862. All three soon after their\r\nappointment were entrusted with this work in Fife and the Lothians,\r\nwhich had already had their solid geology mapped. It was a kind of\r\nmapping which could be done with considerable rapidity, and therefore\r\ninvolved frequent changes of quarters. Thus, as Prof. Geikie says in\r\nthe account already mentioned, which he contributed to the Memoir\r\nattached to Prof. Young’s _Essays and Addresses_, “in a year or so we\r\n[Young and himself] had tramped carefully over the major portion of\r\nFife and the Lothians.”\r\n\r\nFor all three novices this introductory period seems to have left\r\ndelightful recollections. In the Memoir already quoted, Prof. Geikie\r\nsays:--“Those were halcyon days, and I am sure Young enjoyed them to\r\nthe full. Often in subsequent years, after he had finally settled in\r\nGlasgow, he would recur to them, recalling with delight old scenes\r\nand old faces which he and I had known together. The life of a\r\nfield-geologist is, from many points of view, an enviable one, and\r\ncould youth and strength endure, one might well be content to follow it\r\nto the end.”\r\n\r\nThough spoken but of one member of the trio, one may suspect that the\r\nstatements had a wider application. In the case of James Geikie, but\r\nrecently liberated from distasteful drudgery, having changed a life\r\nof close confinement for the open air which he loved, with reasonable\r\nprospects for the future opening out before him, it would have been\r\nstrange if the “premature grave” of the letters of a few years’ earlier\r\ndate had not disappeared into the background, and life become suddenly\r\na great good, for youth and strength were both there, as yet untouched\r\nby time.\r\n\r\nThough the three new members of the Survey were all engaged on the\r\nsame kind of work, it must not be supposed that their work was done\r\nin common. Each had his particular task assigned to him, and though\r\nthey often met, sometimes indeed lodged together, as was the case, for\r\nexample, with Young and Geikie at Peebles in the early part of 1863,\r\nand Peach and Geikie in the spring of 1864, it was only their leisure\r\nhours which were spent in each other’s company. One may, without\r\nincurring the reproach of cynicism, suspect that this greatly increased\r\nthe joys of companionship. If they had worked together, or even in\r\ncouples, the inevitable rubs and difficulties of daily work, however\r\ncongenial, might have checked exuberant intercourse. But meeting as\r\nthey did when the day’s work was over, or only at intervals, with the\r\ntie of common interests, with many experiences to hear and to tell, the\r\ncompanionship became one of the great joys of life.\r\n\r\nThe brief account in the Memoir of Young is impregnated through\r\nand through with the recollection of this gladness of comradeship,\r\nand a few more phrases may be quoted to emphasise the point still\r\nfurther:--“Seated by a cosy peat fire, enveloped in clouds of tobacco\r\nsmoke, confabulating, discussing, speculating, laughing over quaint\r\nscenes and droll experiences, life (if we had only known it!) had not\r\nmuch better to give.” We read also of the wine of life, and can feel\r\nthat the writer of the account, who was then a man of sixty-five,\r\ncould, despite the forty odd years which lay between, still feel its\r\nflavour upon his palate as he wrote. Some of the jokes and quips and\r\ntales of those old days have become Survey property, transmitted by\r\nword of mouth from generation to generation, forming part of that\r\ninvisible strand which binds together the members of an organised body,\r\nso that while the individuals come and go, are separated by the seven\r\nseas, by life and by death, the spirit remains. For each individual\r\nin turn youth goes and strength decays, but something remains; and if\r\nin their dumb northern fashion the individuals in this case generally\r\npassed away without leaving enshrined either in art or in the written\r\nword a direct record of all they felt and did, it may yet not be amiss\r\nto indicate the enthusiasm, the devotion, and the joy that went to the\r\nmaking and colouring of those maps, and were embodied in those formal\r\nrecords.\r\n\r\nBut the immediate purpose here is only to suggest that those early\r\ndays were for James Geikie a conscious escape from prison, a conscious\r\nmeans of self-realisation, and that it was probably the accident that\r\nhis first official field-work was given to the drifts which determined\r\nthe trend of his future scientific work. He states, it is true, in a\r\nshort account of his career which appears in the _Geological Magazine_\r\nfor June 1913, that his interest in the superficial formations,\r\nespecially boulder-clay and the associated gravels and sands, dated\r\nfrom his school-days. One may well believe that, like many another\r\nborn in a region where the till is abundant, he early succumbed to\r\nthe fascination of that untidy but delightful occupation of digging\r\nstones out of the tenacious clay with nature’s weapons, washing them\r\nin the nearest stream, and then following with loving finger-tip those\r\nscratches and striations which bear so romantic a message. Like many\r\nothers he doubtless pressed the cherished pebbles against his cheek,\r\nand verified practically, long years before he wrote it down in a\r\nprinted book, the statement that they are smoothed and polished. Like\r\nmany another also he probably early got into trouble for transferring\r\nin the course of his investigations more of the sticky tenacious\r\ndeposit to his garments than was good for them, and was often under\r\nthe sad necessity of discarding a proportion of the much-loved and\r\nmuch-fingered witnesses of an earlier age, because their abundance made\r\nthe collection grow with unreasonable rapidity. But there is reason\r\nto believe that his early interest in the rocks was not confined to\r\nglacial phenomena, but was disseminated among a variety of geological\r\nsubjects; and it seems probable that the concentration of attention,\r\nthroughout long years, on the Ice Age was largely due to the effect of\r\nhis first work on the Survey, and to the flood of pleasurable emotion\r\nwith which that work was accompanied.\r\n\r\nBut it must not be supposed that his work, even in the early years,\r\nwas confined to the mapping of the superficial deposits. So early\r\nas 1863 he was already doing solid geology, and thereafter went on\r\nwith the mapping of solid and superficial deposits at the same time.\r\nBut while he did much good work quite apart from glacial questions,\r\nand was interested in many kinds of geological problems, it was the\r\nhistory of the Ice Cap of Europe which especially appealed to him. His\r\nholidays--brief in early days--were devoted to the study of glacial\r\nphenomena outside his own region. His leisure hours, spent by some of\r\nhis colleagues in fishing or other forms of sport, or in visiting,\r\nwere largely devoted to keeping himself abreast of the literature of\r\nthe subject; and this was also one of the motives which led him to\r\nstudy languages so assiduously, with the result that he was able to\r\nmake first-hand acquaintance with the papers of all the continental\r\ngeologists who wrote on his own subject.\r\n\r\nIf, however, throughout his long life his geological first love\r\ncommanded his unswerving devotion, it was not because the charms of\r\nother paths did not appeal to him. Some of the letters speak of an\r\nardent desire, apparently never gratified, to deal thoroughly with\r\nCarboniferous problems, to which his attention was drawn during his\r\nprolonged and toilsome mapping of the Lanarkshire coalfield; and in an\r\ninteresting letter to the writer, which dates from the early part of\r\n1909, he speaks of other questions which had also always attracted him.\r\nSome passages from this letter may be quoted:--\r\n\r\n\r\n Curious how the revision of old charts of the Mediterranean have\r\n re-awakened my interest in the structure of that basin or series of\r\n basins! At one time I had a notion of writing a detailed memoir on the\r\n subject, but I found it would be necessary to visit many parts of the\r\n Mediterranean coast-lands which I had not seen and to revisit other\r\n parts which I had looked at. I still think there is much interesting\r\n work awaiting investigation there--the Italian geologists seem to me\r\n to have missed the meaning of some of the evidence which their own\r\n maps supply! If I were only twenty years younger I believe I should\r\n start off at once--that bothering glacial work quite drew me away from\r\n the Mediterranean problems. Now there is no hope for me, unless on\r\n the other side of time I may be permitted to resume investigations.\r\n In that case I shall be independent of railways, steamboats, and even\r\n motor cars, while I presume no hotel accommodation will be required.\r\n Perhaps by means of telepathy I may be able to communicate results\r\n to you as Editor of the Magazine. Unfortunately, however, it would\r\n seem from the records of the Psychical Society, that when one becomes\r\n disembodied and is interviewed by his bereaved and sorrowing friends\r\n he is invariably found to have become little better than a drivelling\r\n idiot, having lost any sense he may at one time have possessed.\r\n Instead of enlightening you on the origin of the Mediterranean, I may\r\n be anxious rather to get you to inform my wife where she will find the\r\n discharged account of some nefarious tradesman who is dunning her for\r\n a sum of 2s. 6d. which I had already paid.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe letter shows that he realised what his devotion had cost him; but\r\nwhen we reflect not only upon what he himself accomplished but on\r\nthe extraordinary stimulus which his conclusions, some of which were\r\nat first fiercely criticised, gave to the investigation of glacial\r\nproblems by others, here, on the Continent, and in America, we can\r\nhardly believe that he regretted seriously his own whole-heartedness.\r\nThe period of his working life, from 1861 onwards till his death,\r\nwitnessed an extraordinary change in the views of geologists upon\r\nproblems connected with ice, saw an enormous output of material in the\r\nway of papers and articles and books, and the world has to be grateful\r\nto James Geikie for both directly and indirectly opening its eyes to\r\nmuch that was previously hidden.\r\n\r\nHis glacial work and its significance are alike discussed by Dr Flett\r\nin the second part of this volume, and need not be treated here,\r\nbut a word or two is necessary to explain the intense interest which\r\nglacial problems aroused among all the Survey men during the period we\r\nare considering, and in James Geikie in particular. A quotation from a\r\nletter of thanks written by Charles Darwin, after receiving a copy of\r\nthe second edition of _The Great Ice Age_, will throw some light upon\r\nthis. The letter is dated 26th October 1876, and Darwin says:--“The\r\nsubject [_i.e._, the Ice Age] is one which fascinates me, chiefly owing\r\nto a little incident which I will mention as showing the grand progress\r\nof geology. When I was a boy an acute old gentleman who had attended\r\nto geology and natural history showed me a boulder in Shropshire, and\r\nassured me solemnly that the world would pass away before any one could\r\nexplain how this great stone came from Cumberland or Scotland. This\r\nmade a deep impression on me, and you may believe how delighted I was\r\nsome forty years ago when floating ice action was first broached, to be\r\nfollowed some years afterwards by glacier action.”\r\n\r\nWe see from this letter that the thought of the mystery of the great\r\nboulder haunted Darwin for years, but the young geologists of the\r\nSurvey were confronted not with one boulder, but, day after day, week\r\nafter week, with an accumulation of only half-explained mysteries.\r\nWhen they started work the view that a large part of the British\r\nIslands had been covered by land ice, and that the boulder-clay was\r\nthe record of its passage, had, after a period of neglect, again come\r\ninto prominence; but it was very far from being universally accepted\r\n(see the historical discussion in Part II.). Then, and for many years\r\nto come, the view that the boulder-clay, erratics, and so forth had\r\nbeen dropped by floating icebergs still commanded many followers. The\r\nsuggestion that there was not one Glacial Period only but a series of\r\nadvances and retreats, with well-marked interglacial periods between,\r\nhad yet to be born. Thus the subject was a burning one at the moment,\r\nand in their meetings, whether in the field or, when the field-work\r\nwas done for the season, at headquarters, the members of the Survey\r\nhad much to discuss and to tell, many fragments of evidence to piece\r\ntogether. They seem all to have been greatly interested in the subject;\r\nbut that James Geikie made it so peculiarly his own was partly due\r\nto the constructive imagination which enabled him to visualise, in\r\na series of brilliant flashes, not the country as he saw it, but\r\nthe former conditions to which it bore testimony. This constructive\r\nimagination was aided also, as has been indicated, by constant toil and\r\nby ceaseless comparison, by means both of personal visits and through\r\nthe writings of others, of local conditions with those of other regions\r\nand of other lands.\r\n\r\nIt is also not without significance to note that his own first work,\r\nand indeed generally most of his Survey work throughout his period of\r\nservice, lay in what is described as the peripheral area of the old\r\nglaciation. In any area which is or has been glaciated it is possible\r\nto distinguish between a central area where erosion is at a maximum,\r\nand where the evidence of the existence of former ice-sheets is almost\r\nnecessarily masked by the work of later glaciers, and a peripheral area\r\nwhere ice work takes the form of deposition. In this latter area it is\r\noften possible to unravel the complex evidence to an extent sufficient\r\nto determine the question whether more than one Glacial Period existed\r\nor not. It was to this problem that James Geikie devoted much of his\r\nattention, and this fact must be regarded as largely explained by the\r\nother that his geological field-work was done in Lowland rather than in\r\nHighland areas.\r\n\r\nIn so far as the details of the Survey work go, we may note that\r\ntheoretically the summer was devoted to field-work and the winter to\r\nindoor work, at first either in London or at the Industrial Museum in\r\nEdinburgh, and later, after the establishment of the Survey Office\r\nin Edinburgh, at that office. But this general scheme was modified\r\nconsiderably by circumstances. Summer and winter, notably, had a\r\nsomewhat different sense from that which the calendar gives. For\r\nexample, an entry in his official diary for 1863 states, under date\r\n17th February:--“Pack-up in Office for country;” while in the same year\r\nfield-work seemed to continue, with short interruptions, till December.\r\nIn the following year, 1864, a start was made even earlier, on 1st\r\nFebruary. That somebody was taking too optimistic a view of Scotch\r\nweather is, however, obvious from the entries in the diary, where\r\n“snow,” “snow,” “snow and rain,” “wet day,” “snow, 8 or 9 inches”\r\nfollow each other with a steady persistency, which justifies the brief\r\nentry on 14th March: “Begin to grow desperate--lock up my razors.”\r\nAt this time Mr Peach and James Geikie were endeavouring to map the\r\nOchils from Kinross as a centre, and Dr Peach informs the writer that\r\nthe two made strenuous but mostly ineffectual efforts to get on with\r\ntheir outdoor work at a time when rocks and superficial deposits alike\r\nwere concealed in a thick mantle of snow. Apparently, however, there\r\nwere some alleviations, for one of the tantalisingly short entries in\r\nthe diary mentions a “Pisgah view of Ochils,” obtained apparently from\r\nRumbling Bridge; while Dr Peach states that out of working hours the\r\ntwo toiled hard at their German.\r\n\r\nThe mode of study took a direction which had some influence on James\r\nGeikie’s future, and is of interest on this account. The first impetus\r\nto the study of the language came apparently from Dr Young, who\r\nwas very friendly with Dr Schmitz, the Rector of the High School,\r\nwhose daughter he married at a later date. Young had apparently a\r\ngood knowledge of the language, and he, early in their association,\r\nurged upon Mr Peach the necessity of acquiring at least a reading\r\nacquaintance with it, and recommended the learning of German poetry as\r\na capital means of obtaining a vocabulary. By the spring of 1864 Mr\r\nPeach had already a considerable repertory, and his recitals roused in\r\nJames Geikie his old passion for verse-making. The songs were first\r\nput into rough English, with many jokes about their sentimentality,\r\nand then James Geikie turned the rough translations into English\r\nverse. This was the beginning of a pastime which he carried on during\r\na large part of his life. A selection of the verses was published in\r\n1887 as _Songs and Lyrics by Heinrich Heine and other German Poets_.\r\nIn the preface the author says that all the renderings there given\r\nwere done “for his own amusement in those ‘brave days of youth,’ when\r\ndifficulties and impossibilities are hardly recognised.” Many of the\r\nverses were published practically unaltered after more than twenty\r\nyears’ interval, for most of them were made in very early days. They\r\noccur in letters, in note-books, diaries, and in various other places\r\namong his papers of the later sixties, and were evidently a true labour\r\nof love.\r\n\r\nAs frequent mention has been made of the diaries, it may be well to\r\nstate that these for the most part contain little or nothing save\r\nthe barest records of mapping done, hours of work, memoranda as to\r\nexpenses, and so forth. Those of the first year or two, however, not\r\nunnaturally, since the work was entirely new, are a little fuller. That\r\nfor 1862, if it ever existed, does not seem to have been preserved;\r\nbut 1863 contains one or two interesting entries, which emphasise\r\nstill further the point already made as to the enthusiasm, plans,\r\nand ambitions with which the Survey was entered. On its first leaf\r\nthe following lines are written:--“Was not so old last year as I am\r\nthis--fact for the curious biographer who is no doubt destined to\r\nreap immortality by the interesting use he will make of the copious\r\nentries in this diary.” But as for many weeks afterwards the “curious\r\nbiographer” finds no written word beyond the statement that drawing\r\npens were bought at an outlay of 1s. 6d., it is to be feared that\r\nno superstructure in regard to an expectation of future fame can be\r\nbuilt upon the entry. The corresponding page on next year’s diary is\r\nmore prosaic, for it bears only a series of “Memoranda” which include\r\nan injunction to get a wife when income allows, and to have only\r\nthree children, two boys and one girl. Rather oddly there is a letter\r\nextant which announces the birth of his third child, many years later,\r\nand bewails the fact that it is another boy, when a girl would have\r\n“rounded off the family so nicely.” The much-loved daughter did not\r\nappear on the scene till many years afterwards.\r\n\r\nFrom the 1863 diary two short entries may be quoted, for they stand\r\nside by side on the same page, and are in many ways very characteristic\r\nof the man. The first relates to a day spent in indoor work, though\r\nwith the careful corollary that this was not due to the weather.\r\nOpposite this formal entry is written:--“Mouth filled with cursings and\r\nmy heart with evil thoughts, all owing to the squalling and girning of\r\nan ill-natured, red-headed, unwashed, petted, fractious imp--the son\r\nand heir of our landlord, the shepherd.” Some of the epithets have been\r\nomitted--the provocation was doubtless extreme!\r\n\r\nThe following day was spent in the open air, and opposite stands\r\nthis:--“Meet J. Y. on top of Black Law; walk back to Summerhope by way\r\nof the old churchyard. Exquisite moonlight night. Scene inexpressibly\r\nsad--feel of course very sentimental; and have a whole troop of\r\ndepressing thoughts and reminiscences,--some of which cause me to\r\nheave sighs like the bellows of the Village Blacksmith. The ingenious\r\nbiographer will never guess what these sighs were for, nor have I any\r\nintention of enlightening him.”\r\n\r\nFinally, we may note that the holidays of the years 1863 and 1864 were\r\nboth spent in Scotland, the first on the shores of the Solway and on\r\nthe coast of Ayrshire; the second on the Moray Firth, then north to\r\nBrora and south-west to Fort William and Oban. Both seem to have been\r\nlargely devoted to geological work, but were on a less ambitious scale\r\nthan many of those of later years.\r\n\r\nThe late spring and summer of 1864 saw James Geikie beginning work in\r\nAyrshire, where he was stationed for some years. With the end of 1864\r\nwe may say that his introductory period of life on the Survey closed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n“THE GREAT ICE AGE”: (1) YEARS OF PREPARATION\r\n\r\n1865-1871\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year 1865 saw James Geikie, as already stated, doing Survey work in\r\nAyrshire, and this, with its continuation, the laborious and sometimes\r\ntedious mapping of the Lanarkshire coalfield, kept him in the west\r\ntill 1872. Of these years of patient toil, diversified by independent\r\nresearch upon the drifts, by geological holidays, and by the making of\r\ntranslations of Heine and other German poets, comparatively little has\r\nbeen preserved. His correspondents in these early days were chiefly the\r\nmembers of his own family, and most of his letters have been destroyed,\r\nexcept where the presence of some cherished verses determined their\r\npreservation. From the scanty records in the diaries, from the few\r\nletters that remain, and from the published account of his surveys, it\r\nis, however, possible to indicate broadly the course of his daily life.\r\n\r\nIn 1865 he was stationed in South Ayrshire, Girvan and Cumnock being\r\ntwo of his centres there. The most notable event of the year, however,\r\nwas a visit to Norway in July to August. Unfortunately, only the barest\r\nnotes of this visit remain, and, except for the descriptions of fiord\r\nscenery in _Prehistoric Europe_ and elsewhere, we do not know what\r\nimpressions were obtained.\r\n\r\nIt was apparently chiefly a steamboat journey, with short excursions to\r\nglaciers and other areas of special interest to the traveller. Boat was\r\ntaken from Newcastle to Aalesund, then _viâ_ Molde and Christiansund\r\n(where a brief note records an exquisite sunset about eleven, with\r\nsunrise following at one) to Trondhjem. After a day in this town the\r\njourney was continued to Rödö and Melövar. From this point a trip was\r\nmade in a boat with four men for twenty miles up the fiord to visit the\r\nFondalen ice-field. Several days were spent here, and various glaciers\r\nwere visited and presumably studied. A return was then made to Melövar,\r\nand the steamer journey continued to Tromsö. After a day here James\r\nGeikie went on to Skjervö, where he arrived at 2 A.M., as is carefully\r\nrecorded, and put up at a merchant’s house, no inn being available.\r\nHere he was most hospitably received, and enjoyed his brief glimpse of\r\na Norwegian interior. Next day a boat was taken across the fiord to the\r\nJökul-fjeld, and an apparently profitable excursion, which included\r\nicebergs and icefalls among the objects seen, ended at a fisherman’s\r\ncot at midnight. Next day was spent idling about, because the wind was\r\nadverse, which suggests that the boat was a sailing-boat, and the start\r\nwas not made till evening, so that the whole night was passed on the\r\nwater, Skjervö not being reached till six in the following morning. Two\r\ndays were spent here, and then the steamer taken to Loppen, from which\r\nan excursion was made to Bergsfiord, where the glacier was visited.\r\nAnother excursion was made to Öksfjord, and the steamboat rejoined as\r\nfar as Hammerfest, the furthest point reached. On the return journey\r\nthe call at Christiansund permitted of an expedition, taken in company\r\nwith the geologist Dr Dahll, during which a “fierce controversy” took\r\nplace. Finally, a Dutch steamer brought the traveller from Bergen to\r\nEngland after what must have been a most instructive tour.\r\n\r\nThe following year, 1866, found him still in Ayrshire. Little record\r\nof it is left, beyond the tale of work, and the publication of his\r\nfirst scientific paper. By this time he had moved to the north of\r\nAyrshire, where he was also in the following year. This year, 1867,\r\nwitnessed the appearance of his first glacial paper, this being “On\r\nthe Buried Forests and Peat Mosses of Scotland, and the Changes of\r\nClimate which they indicate,” a subject which was to engage his\r\nattention more or less closely for the remainder of his life. His spare\r\ntime was still occupied with the translations, many examples of which\r\noccur in his letters to his sisters. Occasionally his muse took less\r\nserious forms, as may be seen from the lines given on next page, which\r\nappear in a letter much of which is taken up with translations from\r\n“that lugubrious poet in whose stanzas the word _weinen_ is rarely\r\nomitted--it may be sweetly rendered by the English whining.” The lines\r\nmentioned follow some criticisms of the habits of the inhabitants of\r\nan Ayrshire town, where the society, in James Geikie’s words, was\r\n“eminently peeous and drouthie.” The lines are as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Takin’ toddy a’ the week,\r\n    Comes the Sabbath day,\r\n    Then to Kirk three times they gang,\r\n    And sleep the fumes away.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the same letter he complains that in this particular town the\r\ninvariable question put to you by strangers whose acquaintance you\r\nmake is, “What church do you attend?” He adds that he had not acquired\r\nthe reputation of a regular church-goer, so that one suspects that\r\nsomething less than the three times a day had to suffice in his case.\r\nFrom this period probably dates an anecdote which he used to tell\r\nhimself of a somewhat unfortunate visit to a place of worship where,\r\ntired out by his week’s work in the open air, and not perhaps greatly\r\ninterested in the discourse, he fell asleep so soundly as ultimately\r\nto fall out of the pew--at the end of which he was sitting--headlong\r\ninto the aisle. He had the presence of mind to remain there with his\r\neyes closed, and was carried out by sympathetic acquaintances, who\r\nthought he had been suddenly overtaken by serious illness. But when\r\nthe feet of the young men were already at the door, the apparently\r\nunconscious patient opened his eyes and winked at one of his friends\r\nto indicate that the fate of Eutychus had not overtaken him on this\r\noccasion. The bearer opposite, with an innocence which did credit to\r\nhis piety, had not thought of the obvious explanation of the accident,\r\nand in his astonishment nearly dropped his burden. History does not,\r\nunfortunately, tell whether his loyalty enabled him to keep the matter\r\nto himself and so preserve his friend’s reputation. For these, it must\r\nbe remembered, were days when a geologist invariably ran the risk of\r\nbeing suspected of “unsoundness,” by the mere fact of his occupation,\r\nand was, therefore, one for whom jesting on the threshold of a church\r\nwas particularly dangerous.\r\n\r\nIn this year of 1867 Mr (now Dr) John Horne joined the Survey, and\r\nvery shortly afterwards made James Geikie’s acquaintance. There thus\r\nbegan a friendship which lasted to the end. Almost from the first Mr\r\nHorne shared Geikie’s enthusiasm for glacial work, and so early as\r\n2nd April 1868 a letter from the latter to one of his sisters records\r\nthe fact that “Young Horne has got me a lot of information, and I\r\nshall certainly get a lot more.” From this time, indeed, James Geikie\r\nconstantly asked his colleagues for notes about the glacial phenomena\r\nin the areas they were respectively surveying, and for friendship’s\r\nsake was freely supplied with these. Thus in the course of time he\r\nacquired a large amount of detailed information about the different\r\nparts of Scotland, with answers to many questions which cropped up in\r\nthe course of his own investigations. It was not till his early papers,\r\nand especially the publication of _The Great Ice Age_, had attracted\r\nthe attention of a wider circle of geologists, that this correspondence\r\nwas enlarged to include most parts of the civilised world. As we shall\r\nsee later, his early foreign letters gave him great pleasure, even\r\nthough, until he realised the value of a feeling for languages and\r\na good stock of dictionaries, he had often to ask for help in their\r\ntranslation.\r\n\r\nA few lines from a letter to Mr Horne, written from Eaglesham on 8th\r\nMay 1868, may help to show the kind of work he was doing, and reveal\r\nalso those characteristics which made his colleagues willing to give\r\nhim all the help they could:--\r\n\r\n\r\n DEAR YOUNG MAN,--I hope you are still in the land of the living and\r\n the place of hope wherever that may be. These lines I write unto you\r\n not that your joy may be full but that you may know that I take (I\r\n won’t say a fatherly) interest in your welfare, but any other kind of\r\n interest you like but self-interest. What are you about, and how do\r\n you like the work? Is the Drift blinding your eyes and do you yet see\r\n as through a glass darkly? I suppose your Boulder-clay in the high\r\n grounds will give you no bother. If you get any gravel will you be so\r\n good as let me know whether it occurs in valleys whose watershed is\r\n over or under 1000 feet?\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Horne was then working in the Nith valley, being stationed at\r\nThornhill. James Geikie by this time had moved from Ayrshire into\r\nRenfrewshire and Lanarkshire.\r\n\r\nBut the great event of 1868, apart from the publication of two more\r\nglacial papers, was a trip up the Rhine and on to Switzerland, of which\r\none of the note-books contains a very full and jovial record, which\r\nhas been supplemented by the recollections of some of the surviving\r\nmembers of the party, who were all Survey men. The record is too long\r\nto quote in full, but certain passages may be given. The opening gives\r\nso lively a picture of the party, and of the rollicking spirits with\r\nwhich they started, that it cannot be omitted. In connection with\r\nthe informality of tone, it must be remembered that the diary was\r\nonly a private record of a gay holiday. It is interspersed, quite\r\ncharacteristically, by very neat diagrams and sketches, and details of\r\nthe geological observations, which were no doubt worked up afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Wednesday, 29th July 1868._\r\n\r\n Edinburgh to London--Peach, Skae, Horne, and Archie in company. Arrive\r\n infernally hungry and dirty at St Catherine’s dock. Have to swear at\r\n a cabman, etc. This of course was Thursday, 30th. Friday, 31st--Start\r\n in the _Orion_ for Antwerp--ship none of the best, but passable. Of\r\n course a number of English on board. None of them I know. Have a kind\r\n of luncheon and satisfy hunger pangs. Brisk breeze gets up towards\r\n the afternoon, and puts to flight notions of dinner in the respective\r\n buzzums of Skae, Horne, and Archie. Peach and I wait so long that\r\n our hunger vanishes. Ladies laid out in corpse-like fashion all over\r\n the deck, and a good deal of basin work performed. Two very pretty\r\n English girls on board--as pretty I think as I ever saw before.\r\n Both hold up for a while, but after a time they give in and close\r\n up their eyes like daisies. Skae off to bed--Horne having meanwhile\r\n mysteriously disappeared. Archie follows suit. I smoke, and Peach in\r\n despair hovers about the door of the feeding saloon in hopes of being\r\n able to see something like preparations for tea. Tea at last! Only 5\r\n out of nearly 150 passengers sit down--one of them a lady. Peach and\r\n I make a furious onslaught to make up for loss of dinner. Horne, to\r\n our surprise, enters, tastes a cup of tea and beats a hasty retreat.\r\n The place is close and stifling, and the sounds issuing from the\r\n surrounding berths make appeals which cannot be resisted. Peach and I\r\n make for the deck, where the fresh air revives us, and I finish off my\r\n meal with a pipe.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere follow, by one of the sudden transitions in which the diary\r\nabounds, notes on the colour of the water, and on the jellyfish seen.\r\n\r\nA night’s sleep seems to have restored the party, for they landed at\r\nAntwerp the following morning apparently all in good spirits, and after\r\na stroll round the town took train for Cologne, passing Liège, “which\r\nlies beautifully in a lovely wooded valley,” _en route_. After a short\r\nvisit to Cologne--“here I was pleased to find Heine’s good Christopher\r\nin the Dom”--the party went on by boat to Königswinter. “Sail up the\r\nRhine not very interesting, but the evening is exquisite and the\r\nflat country looks well.” At Königswinter they spent some days--very\r\nhot ones--climbing the Siebengebirge and geologising, with lighter\r\nintervals. One of the interludes may be mentioned:--“Peach swam across\r\nthe Rhine in twelve minutes (before breakfast).”\r\n\r\nAfter a day or two at Königswinter the party went down the Rhine to\r\nBonn, to see Prof. Zirkel there and to visit the museum. Bonn is\r\nsomewhat briefly dismissed:--“This is a lost day. I hate Bonn ...\r\nhooked it back to Königswinter--and loafed about.” At Bonn the party\r\nmet Sir Roderick Murchison, then Director-General of the Geological\r\nSurvey, profanely called “the Duke” in the diary, for his mannerisms\r\nmade a strong appeal to the sense of humour of the more lively members\r\nof the party. The veteran geologist--or at least so the juniors\r\nasserted--graduated his greetings in careful accordance with the\r\nofficial position of each. But the old chief’s genuine interest in\r\ngeology was shown by his eager questions about the recent results of\r\nthe Survey work in the Southern Uplands.\r\n\r\nFinally Königswinter was left, “with regret,” for the Laacher See, a\r\ndetailed visit to the Eifel country being one of the great objects\r\nof the tour. James Geikie’s early work in the Ochils had aroused his\r\ninterest in volcanic phenomena, and his geological notes in regard to\r\nthe next section of the tour are singularly full.\r\n\r\nThe party took steamer to Brohl, and then drove to the lake, being,\r\nas is carefully recorded, cheated both by the boatman who took them\r\noff the steamer and by the driver. Perhaps the fact accounts for the\r\nnext entry:--“I have seen prettier places than the Laacher See.” The\r\nparty had an introduction, obtained presumably through Prof. Zirkel, to\r\none of the fathers at Laach Abbey, and he and a companion accompanied\r\nthem on a tour round the lake, in order to point out the objects of\r\ngeological interest. A trip to the Bausenberg was also made. Next day\r\nthe members of the party walked to Niedermendig to see the famous\r\nquarries there. Here they tasted the beer stored in the caverns, and\r\ncharacteristically--for James Geikie did not have to wait for Mr\r\nChesterton to sing the merits of beer--the diary devotes nearly equal\r\nspace to the geology and the beverage. “It was deliciously cold and I\r\nlike the flavour. I had heard much of the coldness of this beer, viz.,\r\nthat no one could drink more than a small glassful at a time. But I\r\nfound no difficulty in taking down a good pint, and if I had not had\r\nthe mine to get out of, I could easily have stowed away double the\r\nquantum.”\r\n\r\nSome other interesting excursions were made in the neighbourhood of\r\nthe Laacher See, in company with the friendly monks, and then finally\r\nthe party set off in a farm wagon for a thirty-mile drive to Daun, in\r\nthe heart of the Eifel country, over very rough roads. The vehicle was\r\ncheap, but this seems to have been its only merit, and the driver, a\r\nprosperous peasant with money in the bank, as he explained to them,\r\nhad the disadvantage of not knowing the way. The journey took over\r\ntwelve hours, and when the tired party reached the village it was to\r\nfind that it was market-day there, and rooms were difficult to obtain,\r\nso that the weary scientists had to seek lodgings where they could,\r\nsome in an inn, where they were “nearly eaten up with fleas,” and\r\nothers in a private house. After a day here, another long drive was\r\ntaken to Bertrich, where the better hotels, an indirect result of the\r\nlocal medicinal springs, revived the drooping spirits of the diarist.\r\nUnfortunately the bill next morning proved that the presence of the\r\nvisitors had another effect also, and the tone of the diary again\r\nbecomes subdued, till, after a long drive, the Moselle was reached, and\r\nits scenery had a restorative effect.\r\n\r\nAt Cochem the geologists engaged a boat and two men to row them forty\r\nmiles down the Moselle to Coblentz. The first twenty miles, it is\r\ncarefully explained, were delightful; but darkness came on long before\r\nthe destination was reached, and it was midnight before an unwilling\r\ndockkeeper allowed the boat to enter Coblentz. But in spite of the\r\nfatigue and tedium of the long journey, the diarist expresses himself\r\nas highly delighted with the trip.\r\n\r\nCoblentz did not make a favourable impression on the travellers, and\r\nthe diary contains some caustic remarks on the Prussian soldiers, with\r\nwhom the town was full, and on the Prussian officers whose manners at\r\ntable in the hotel were a trial to persons accustomed to place reliance\r\nupon a fork rather than a knife as an implement for conveying food\r\ninto the mouth. The subject is one which recurs more than once, for\r\nJames Geikie, who was singularly susceptible to feminine charm, seemed\r\nto resent strongly the general lack of it among the German ladies\r\nmet with, and could not reconcile himself to the sight of a Fräulein\r\ndisposing of peas by a method whose only advantage was its rapidity.\r\nIf the sound reflection that a lady who habitually uses a broad-bladed\r\nknife for this purpose is rarely so clumsy as to slit her mouth\r\ncompletely from ear to ear in the process occurred to him, it evidently\r\nafforded no consolation, and he found it difficult to sit out a meal\r\nin a German hotel if peas entered into the menu. He himself attempted\r\nno missionary work, however, though he records meeting two “Yankees,”\r\none of whom “had induced one or two German ladies to use their forks\r\ninstead of their knives for pitching in the victuals. They were\r\nsurprised, they told him, that the fork could do the work so nicely!”\r\n\r\nAt Coblentz two of the party, Messrs Horne and Skae, turned back,\r\nwhile the rest went on to Goarshausen, where they passed a delightful\r\ncouple of days. “It is one of the prettiest spots in all the Rhine\r\ncountry.” The next stop was at Heidelberg, where the customary sights\r\nwere visited, and the scarred countenances of the students commented on\r\nwith true British disgust; the journey was then continued _viâ_ Basle,\r\nBerne, Thun, and Interlaken to Grindelwald. Here the famous guide Peter\r\nMichel was engaged, and the party spent “a most interesting day” on\r\nthe glaciers. “The ice phenomena were well seen, but best on the lower\r\nglacier.” So successful was the excursion that it was resolved, though\r\nall were inexperienced, to make the crossing of the Strahlegg to the\r\nGrimsel. Bad weather made it necessary to stop two nights at the Bäregg\r\nhut, and of these and the day’s imprisonment an amusing description\r\nis given. On the second day the weather cleared and the chalet was\r\nleft at five, and, after a tiring day, the party reached the Grimsel\r\nat six in the evening, some of the members being much fatigued. Some\r\ninteresting observations were made _en route_. From the Grimsel the\r\nparty made their way down the Rhone valley to Lake Geneva, and at this\r\npoint the diary ends abruptly. The excursion, it is clear, was one of\r\ngreat interest, and coupled with the previous visit to Norway, must\r\nhave played an important part in helping James Geikie to visualise the\r\nEurope of the Ice Age.\r\n\r\nThe next three years, 1869, 1870, and 1871, were spent for the most\r\npart in hard and continuous work on the coalfields, though in all three\r\nyears the published papers, no less than the letters, show that all the\r\nenergy which could be spared from the daily routine was being given to\r\nglacial work.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1869 James Geikie started work at Carluke, and an\r\nentertaining letter to his mother has been preserved, dated from here\r\non 4th April. It is long and largely about family affairs, but a few\r\nquotations may be made, for the tone throws light upon the character\r\nboth of mother and son. The letter begins abruptly as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n This being a day of rest not only for the beasts that do the work of\r\n men, but also for the men that do the work of beasts, it behoveth me\r\n thy son to throw aside the cares of the world and the many humbugs\r\n that do so easily beset me, and to refresh my soul and peradventure\r\n thine also by inditing these few words, to the intent that thou, O my\r\n maternal parent! may know of a surety that I thy son am well, and that\r\n thy two daughters who sojourn with me here in the wilderness are even\r\n as I am....\r\n\r\n Write unto me, O my maternal parent! and tell me how it fareth with\r\n thy trees which yield fruit of their kind, and with the flowers which\r\n thou dost tend in the house that is heated with pipes and hot water\r\n in the pipes. And say unto my paternal parent that he hath forgotten\r\n me--that I am even as one of the dead--that I long to see the writing\r\n of his hand.\r\n\r\n Here many friends visit me not--but I am not grieved--and my\r\n waistcoats grow tight about me....\r\n\r\n Thy daughters salute thee and the paternal--so I salute ye all in\r\n like manner. My blessing abide with ye--and in the bonds of love I\r\n subscribe myself.--Yours affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther family letters in the same year are written from Hamilton,\r\none, dated 19th July, containing the information in regard to his\r\ntranslations that “I have so many now that I think if I go on for a\r\nmonth or so longer I shall have enough to make a small volume.”\r\n\r\nThe allusion to fruit-trees, in the letter quoted above, it is\r\ninteresting to note, was especially to a pear-tree which grew in the\r\ngarden of the house in Duncan Street where the family lived at this\r\ntime. The house is one of two which a few years ago were converted by\r\nthe Edinburgh School Board into a special school, and in the course\r\nof the alterations the jargonelle pear-tree, which figures in many of\r\nthe family letters, was cut down. It seems to have been a prolific\r\nbearer in its prime, and in one of his letters James Geikie alludes to\r\nreceiving a basket of the fruit, and at the same time to the prolonged\r\nsilence of the members of the family, which he explains as the result\r\nof the “pear-disease,” _i.e._, the absorption of his sisters in the\r\ntask of consuming the fruit. He himself sends some rhymes in return for\r\nhis share.\r\n\r\nThe year 1870 finds him still busy on the coalfield, his diary for that\r\nyear being full of notes of appointments with people connected with the\r\npits, while he seems to have been constantly moving from place to place\r\nin Lanarkshire.\r\n\r\nTwo letters from Prof. Ramsay in July of this year have an historical\r\ninterest. The first suggests a joint tour on the Rhine to solve a\r\ngeological problem, and is followed almost at once by another, saying,\r\n“Now I fear my Rhine journey is blown to the winds.... This most wicked\r\nand accursed war will upset half the Continent of Europe, and it is by\r\nno means impossible that we may be dragged into it”--upon which one\r\nfeels disposed to make the comment that if we had been it is possible\r\nthat infinite suffering might have been saved forty-four years later! A\r\nletter from James Geikie to Mr Horne, written later in the same year,\r\nsays:--“My holidays, I think I told you, were all botched. I could not\r\nget abroad, and I had nowhere particular to go at home.”\r\n\r\nAt this time he was stationed at Salsburgh by Holytown, where he made\r\nseveral friends, notably Dr Grossart, with whom afterwards he kept up a\r\ncorrespondence for many years.\r\n\r\nIn the letter to Mr Horne quoted above he says:--“I have been doing\r\na little at those German translations, and have now finished the\r\nvolume, and am on the outlook for a publisher who won’t cheat me. I\r\nwish to have the thing published this winter”--a wish which was not,\r\nhowever, fulfilled for many winters. In the same letter he adds:--“I\r\nam still among coal ... but Xmas is coming, and then one will have an\r\nopportunity of washing the dirt away. I like this place very well. The\r\nhouse is clean, and the district is moory--just on the outskirts of the\r\ngreat coalfield. I mean to work out as much as I can from here so as to\r\nshorten my stay in Glasgow, of which (I) got tired. After all there is\r\nnothing like the free fresh air of the country.”\r\n\r\nThe next year, 1871, saw the finishing up of the coalfield work,\r\nand simultaneously the beginnings of a gathering together of the\r\naccumulated mass of glacial material which was a year or two later to\r\ntake shape in _The Great Ice Age_. Letters in the early part of the\r\nsummer to Mr Horne contain detailed plans for a tour in the Hebrides\r\n“for the purpose of ascertaining the direction of ice-striæ, and\r\nquizzing the drifts.” It proved impossible for his friend to join him,\r\nand the tour was made in company with Mr William Galloway, one of many\r\nfriends made in the west.\r\n\r\nMr Galloway has kindly supplied a few notes on the tour. The two sailed\r\nfrom Glasgow to Stornoway by the Crinan Canal, and walked to the north\r\npoint of the island, carrying their belongings with them. Both had a\r\nspecial purpose in view, James Geikie being engaged, of course, in\r\nstudying glacial action, while his friend had been commissioned to\r\ninvestigate the possibility of establishing a meteorological station\r\nat the lighthouse on the Butt of Lewis. On their way back to Barvas\r\nthey came across an old highland woman who made cups and saucers\r\nof unbaked clay. James Geikie was much interested in her work, and\r\nordered a set. It was despatched to Lady (then Mrs) Ramsay, the wife\r\nof Prof. Ramsay, then Senior Director of the Geological Survey (_cf._\r\nPart II.), as a sample of prehistoric ware from the Outer Hebrides.\r\nThe joke was explained later, but not before, or so it is asserted,\r\nsome high archæological authorities in London had been taken in by the\r\n“primitive” appearance of the work.\r\n\r\nThe travellers, presumably on the homeward journey, began a joint\r\ncomposition in heroic verse describing their adventures; but this\r\nmasterpiece seems never to have been committed to paper, and perhaps\r\nnever progressed very far.\r\n\r\nThe tour was apparently short, for James Geikie writes from Bathgate,\r\nunder date 28th November:--“This last year has been a year of close\r\nwork and some anxiety, and not having had any holiday to speak of I\r\nfeel jaded and down in the mouth.”\r\n\r\nIn all his letters of this year he speaks of his laborious work among\r\nthe collieries, and his note-books are filled with the usual details\r\nof appointments made and notes of information received from different\r\nquarters. The following spring saw him in more congenial surroundings\r\nin the Border counties, and this chapter may fitly end with the\r\ncompletion of his coalfield work. It may be added, however, that\r\nletters from Ramsay, received at the close of the year, and dealing\r\nwith the problems raised by James Geikie’s paper on “Changes of Climate\r\nduring the Glacial Epoch,” a paper of which Ramsay thought highly, show\r\nclearly what the years of preparation had done for him, despite their\r\nalmost ceaseless toil.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed, however, that life was made up of nothing but\r\ntoil, alleviated by occasional holidays. For many years a considerable\r\namount of the Survey work was done in London, and parts of many winters\r\nwere spent there. In addition to the Survey men, James Geikie had\r\na considerable number of friends and acquaintances in London, his\r\nfather’s musical connections opening various musical and artistic\r\ncircles to him. Both in scientific and artistic circles his social\r\ngifts were much appreciated, and he himself must have found the winter\r\nglimpses into a wider social life than he could find either in the\r\ncountry districts or in the smaller towns of Scotland a most welcome\r\nchange.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n“THE GREAT ICE AGE”: (2) PUBLICATION\r\n\r\n1872-1874\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1872 James Geikie was somewhat late in beginning\r\nfield-work, but the end of April saw him established at Kelso. An\r\ninteresting letter to his friend Dr Grossart at Holytown, dated 4th\r\nMay, may be quoted as showing his feelings in regard to his new\r\nsphere:--\r\n\r\n\r\n I found I could not make out a flying visit to Salsburgh before\r\n leaving the west country for good. But I hope to see you some time\r\n before the year is very old. I have been knocking about a good deal\r\n since I saw you, but, praise be thankit! I have at last got back into\r\n the country. And what a lovely country it is! Coming so soon after\r\n Airdrie and Coatbridge it looks quite like another world. I can hardly\r\n believe that I am in the same planet where coal and iron are being\r\n worked. Here is nothing but the sandstones below the limestones and\r\n the Old Red with its trap rocks. The people too are as sleepy and\r\n old-fashioned and “respectable” as the rocks they live upon or rather\r\n _above_. This is the kind of land that would be after your own heart.\r\n Here are old abbeys and tumble-down castles, and every field and\r\n stream has some old-world story connected with it. At first I hardly\r\n could thole the quiet of Kelso. I have lived so much of late amongst\r\n smoke and din that for a week or so I felt like a fish out of water.\r\n The big market-place here, with nobody in it, was depressing to look\r\n at. I didn’t like the way either that the shopkeepers rushed upon me\r\n when I ventured into their shops--it looked for all the world as if\r\n they never had had any customer but me since the New Year. And yet\r\n they tell me that Kelso is a thriving country town. It may be so--very\r\n likely it is so--but it seems to one newly come from the stirring\r\n “west” like a dead-alive place.\r\n\r\n What are you about? How does the great “work”[1] progress? I have been\r\n compelled to drop scribbling for a little, having rather overdone it\r\n this winter in Bathgate and Edinburgh. But the smell of the spring\r\n woods and hedges has set me up again, and I meditate an early assault\r\n on pen and ink.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [1] A book on _The History of the Shotts_ upon which Dr Grossart\r\n    was engaged. It appeared in 1880.\r\n\r\nA letter to Mr Horne, from Kelso, in the same month of May, strikes a\r\nsomewhat similar note:--\r\n\r\n\r\n Here I am, in the midst of green trees, purling brooks, whistling\r\n mavises and love-sick young ladies. I feel quite a new man now that I\r\n am released from the presence of coal smoke and pits; up to any amount\r\n of fun as of yore.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the same letter he speaks of the reception met with by his glacial\r\npapers:--\r\n\r\n\r\n I have had some very gratifying letters from Sweden and Switzerland\r\n from geologists there--saying how much they are pleased with my\r\n results, and giving me more notes which help out my conclusions. It\r\n seems they have interglacial periods in Sweden also. Of all places in\r\n the world I had also a letter from a Prof. Szabó of Pest in Hungary.\r\n So that you see a prophet is not without honour save in his own\r\n country.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother letter, also written from Kelso, on 15th June, says:--\r\n\r\n\r\n Man--I feel awfully tempted to go to Sweden, where I have the promise\r\n of meeting with a warm welcome from some of the geologists. But\r\n I can’t go, and have reluctantly had to delay a visit till next\r\n year. I continue now and again to get a gratifying letter about my\r\n papers which cheers me up amazingly. Woodward the editor[2] writes\r\n to-night congratulating me on the wind-up, and saying that everyone\r\n speaks highly of my lucubrations. After trying my hands at many\r\n things I think I have at last got into the right groove. The noble\r\n hammer-bearing fraternity have not heard the last of my “theories.”\r\n ... What a fertile source of amusement this blessed Glacial Epoch has\r\n been!\r\n\r\n\r\n    [2] Of the _Geological Magazine_, in which the glacial papers had\r\n    appeared.\r\n\r\nThe summer holiday this year was spent in Lewis, but the chief record\r\nwhich remains is that contained in papers contributed to the _Quarterly\r\nJournal of the Geological Society_ and the _Geological Magazine_. In\r\nSeptember he writes from Norham an affectionate letter to Dr Grossart,\r\nexpressing longing for a “haver,” and giving news of his glacial work.\r\nThe letter goes on:--\r\n\r\n\r\n How does the _magnum opus_ progress? I am still working away at\r\n mine--nearly finished--both me and my book. I got some very startling\r\n facts this summer in the island of Lewis which I shall send to the\r\n London Geolog. Society--the facts, not the island.\r\n\r\n\r\nA month later he writes from Duns to Mr Horne in regard to some\r\nspecimens which he wants for a course of lectures to be given to\r\nworking-men at the Museum of Science and Art during the winter. In this\r\nletter he speaks of being attacked by a form of nervous prostration\r\nwhich renders him incapable of continued work, so that the _magnum\r\nopus_ is at a standstill. The task was evidently proving more severe\r\nthan he anticipated, and the illness was prolonged, for in a letter to\r\nDr Grossart, written from Edinburgh on 4th January 1873, he says:--\r\n\r\n\r\n This winter things have gone back with me. I was laid up most of\r\n November and December, but am now all right again. But this enforced\r\n idleness has kept back my book, which the longer I stick at it seems\r\n to grow and grow till I begin to get frightened at its dimensions.\r\n This summer, however, I hope to send it to the printer.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the same letter he speaks of his lectures at the Museum of Science\r\nand Art, and also of another on the “Antiquity of Man in Britain,”\r\nwhich he was to give at Birkenhead at the beginning of February. The\r\nlecture, which was duly delivered and also published, dealt with a\r\nsubject to which he had been led by his glacial work. It was one in\r\nwhich his interest increased as time went on, and in later years “Man\r\nduring the Ice Age” occupied a good deal of his leisure, up to the very\r\nend.\r\n\r\nAt Duns James Geikie made a number of friends, and indeed throughout\r\nhis work in the Border counties he seems to have met with much\r\nhospitality, and this even before his sojourn in Jedburgh led to his\r\nacquaintanceship with the family in which he found his wife, and to\r\nthe region becoming a second homeland for him. During his stay at Duns\r\nthe book was progressing steadily, despite his hard work in the field.\r\nIn June he was writing to Mr Horne and Prof. Ramsay for information in\r\nregard to certain special points, and the latter was very anxious for\r\nJames Geikie to accompany him on a geologising holiday to the Rhine,\r\nto investigate some disputed questions. This proposal was not accepted,\r\nhowever, apparently because James Geikie was dissatisfied with the only\r\ninformation he could obtain about glacial deposits on the south side\r\nof the Alps, and made up his mind to seek satisfaction by a personal\r\ntour to the district. This trip is mentioned in a letter written to Dr\r\nGrossart from Kelso on 20th July, in which he says:--\r\n\r\n\r\n My summer has been spent in a ram-sham desultory sort of way. I have\r\n hammered out the geological structure of the Cheviots, which is\r\n something interesting and new, and I have also got some interesting\r\n glacial results. I have had a hard time of it with the lawyers\r\n though, having been summoned twice to London to give evidence before\r\n Committees of Parliament about that confounded Edinburgh water of\r\n which every honest man in Edinburgh is heartily sick. I know I am.\r\n But that is over now. In a fortnight I start for Italy, and am going\r\n to make a long tour of it: Paris, Geneva, Martigny, Aosta, Turin,\r\n Bologna, Verona, Venice, Trieste, and Vienna, then back through the\r\n Tyrol and down the Rhine to Rotterdam, Amsterdam, etc., and home. I\r\n shall be a fortnight or three weeks scouring along the foot of the\r\n Piedmontese Alps looking at the glacial things.\r\n\r\n My book is finished and off to the printers at last. But I fear that\r\n it will be delayed by the engraver, who does not get on with the\r\n illustrations as fast as I could wish. Anyhow I hope I shall be able\r\n to send you a copy this winter.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo detailed account of the Italian trip has been preserved, but various\r\nletters make allusions to it. Thus writing to Mr Horne from Jedburgh on\r\n17th September, he speaks of his visit to Lake Como, ending up:--“Alas!\r\nall the sunshine is over, and here I am in dull Scotch autumn, thinking\r\nsadly that the world and one’s destinies are not more amenable to\r\none’s wishes. But Scotland is not so bad after all.” His next visit to\r\nthe lake was made in company with his wife and her sister, and during\r\nthe trip he told how on his first visit he had lost himself in the\r\nAlps at dark, and after some difficulty and various adventures reached\r\na little hamlet. Here there was no inn, but the priest of the village\r\nkindly put him up for the night, the two conversing in Latin in default\r\nof any other means of communication.\r\n\r\nHe speaks also of his Italian tour in a letter to Dr Grossart, dated\r\nfrom Jedburgh on 11th October, in which he says:--\r\n\r\n\r\n Did I write you giving an account of my Italian trip? I know that I\r\n meant to do so. I enjoyed myself amazingly, and picked up a lot of\r\n wrinkles which will stand me in good stead. Ods man! but it was hot\r\n spielin’ the hills with the thermometer 94° in the shade. God knows\r\n but I thought it not far short of 500° in the sun.... I’m going to\r\n take it easy this winter--if I can. I have now got my _magnum opus_\r\n off my hands, and hope to send you a copy next month. It makes some\r\n 500 pages of demy 8vo!--a wiselike size!... The illustrations will\r\n please you, I hope. They have been beautifully engraved.... The\r\n country here is looking beautiful--woods having all their autumn\r\n colours on. I don’t wonder that emigrants who were born on the Jed,\r\n the Teviot, and the Tweed should aye have such intense longings to\r\n get back again to their native howffs. It makes one young as a boy to\r\n wander up the sweet glens and ravines in this lovely district. If I\r\n were in love I’m afraid I should use up whole reams of paper in the\r\n composing of passionate songs and sonnets. But not being so I can only\r\n croon as I trot along the half-forgotten words of some old Border\r\n ditty.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome other passages in this and other letters suggest that with the\r\nfinishing of the great book, and the lifting of the strain, the young\r\nman felt _désœuvré_, was beginning to think that youth was slipping\r\naway and he was perhaps not getting the best out of life, and was\r\nliable to alternate fits of depression and of a cynicism which was\r\nprobably largely a pose intended to hide his true feelings. In brief,\r\nhe was becoming aware that it is not good for man to dwell alone, and\r\nthe Glacial Epoch, whatever its charms, proved a chilly substitute for\r\nthe kind of companionship which his affectionate spirit craved. A few\r\nextracts from a letter, undated, but written from Jedburgh, apparently\r\nabout the same time as the foregoing, may help to make the position\r\nclear. The letter may be entitled--anything more specific being\r\navoided--“To a Young Man contemplating Matrimony,” and the quotations\r\nmust necessarily be disjointed:--\r\n\r\n\r\n You know your own affairs best. But if I were in your place, and the\r\n girl were a really good girl and suitable, hang it I would propose\r\n and get her.... Something like fate whispers in my ear, “Jim, my\r\n boy, you’ll never have a wife, altho’ you should live to the age of\r\n Methusaleh.” ... With the uncertainty of temper and feeling that I\r\n have, I seriously doubt whether I would be other than miserable if I\r\n were to marry. So lest you should get into the same state, O young\r\n man! either flee temptation or be bold and seize the tempter. What\r\n more can I say. Perhaps you were only laughing when you wrote me, and\r\n are now laughing at me and my soft-heartedness. All right, laugh away.\r\n I have had my day, and some time you shall have had yours also.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps it may be added that when this letter was written its author\r\nwas thirty-four. His marriage took place some eighteen months\r\nlater, after an engagement which had lasted more than six months.\r\nHe was destined to experience nearly forty years of happy married\r\nlife, to see his children grow up, to welcome the advent of his\r\ngrandchildren--either it was not fate who did the whispering, or she\r\ndisplayed a more than feminine contrariness.\r\n\r\nOther letters during the autumn months give merely notes on the\r\nprogress of the book, which was unexpectedly delayed, and information\r\nas to his prospective plans for the winter in Edinburgh. One to Dr\r\nGrossart, dated from Jedburgh on 22nd November, may be quoted as\r\nsumming up what is said in various other letters which have been\r\npreserved:--\r\n\r\n\r\n With this I send you a short lucubration of mine on the Island of\r\n Lewis, the chief point in which is the proof given that the Outer\r\n Hebrides were overflowed by land ice from the mainland!\r\n\r\n I am happy to say that I am nearly out of the hands of the printer.\r\n My book has swelled out beyond what I intended, making close on 600\r\n pages. The illustrations, which have kept back the printing, are now\r\n finished, and I expect to have a bound copy in my hands in ten days or\r\n so. It won’t be published, however, much before Xmas, as we have made\r\n arrangements with an American firm to publish it at the same time in\r\n Yankee land. This is a great stroke of good luck, as it will lessen\r\n the cost of production and make the book payable. Some of the maps I\r\n believe you will find very interesting. In fact, I have so written the\r\n book that whether geologists accept all my general conclusions or not,\r\n they will at least know a good deal that they did not know before,\r\n after they have perused it.... I am booked for a series of lectures\r\n this winter at the Museum of Science and Art, my subject being the\r\n Carboniferous Epoch. I am going to treat it in a pictorial way, trying\r\n to reproduce for them the kind of scenery and climate then enjoyed in\r\n Britain. I have also a lot more literary work in hand--_A Manual on\r\n Coal-Mining_--in which I do the geology and an engineering celebrity\r\n does the practical part. This and other matters keep my hands full.\r\n Nevertheless I have still an occasional dig at my German Songs.\r\n (Strange mixture! you will say. But then man is a queer mixture\r\n altogether.) Some time or other the Songs will see the light--but as I\r\n look on that matter as pleasure, and the scientific work as business,\r\n the Songs must stand aside till their betters are served. Write and\r\n give me your news. You see, like an old bachelor I have nothing to\r\n write about but myself. So you must under the circumstances excuse the\r\n egotism.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe book appeared early in the New Year, and the fact that the author\r\nwas then in Edinburgh and must have presented copies to his nearest\r\nfriends in person, no doubt accounts for the absence of many letters\r\nacknowledging receipt among his papers. Two notes from Prof. Ramsay, to\r\nwhom, as his “dear friend and teacher,” the book was dedicated, may,\r\nhowever, be quoted. Both are dated from Jermyn Street, and are written\r\non successive days, 20th and 21st January 1874. The letters are as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n MY DEAR GEIKIE,--I have got your beautiful vol. quite late in the day\r\n and am now engaged in physically cutting it up. Your dedication makes\r\n me so proud that since reading it I have held my head quite like the\r\n Duke of Argyll, and I only hope it will not fall off behind. I must\r\n close, and will take the book home with me to read the dedication\r\n aloud in an impressive way after dinner.--Ever sincerely,\r\n\r\n  ANDRW. RAMSAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n MY DEAR GEIKIE,--I will read all your book, mair by token that I read\r\n 4 chapters of it last night after dinner and liked them all. The plan\r\n is good and it is admirably written, as indeed it was sure to be....\r\n As for your converting every reader to all your views, that is not\r\n likely as long as the Duke of Argyll remains alive. When a man does\r\n anything really in advance he may be well pleased if in 10 or 14 years\r\n he gets a fair proportion of the best men on his side. So no more this\r\n bout. From yours consumedly,\r\n\r\n  ANDRW. RAMSAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn May of the same year Ramsay writes again, saying:--“I am delighted\r\nto hear of the success of your book, which indeed I never doubted, for\r\nI always considered it a first-rate production, though I have only read\r\nit by snatches.”\r\n\r\nBut though James Geikie had lingered long in the company of the Ice\r\nMaiden, he had not given her that embrace which is fatal to the\r\nearth-born, and the summer of this year brought him other thoughts than\r\nthose of glaciers and moraines, brought him to a new phase in his life\r\nwhich demands another chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nMARRIAGE AND LIFE AT PERTH\r\n\r\n1875-1877\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1874 James Geikie returned from Edinburgh to the\r\nCheviot region. Before starting his field-work he made a brief visit to\r\nthe Continent, in regard to which his diary only contains records of\r\ndates and places. The motive of the visit is of interest as throwing\r\nlight on his strong family feeling. At his instigation his youngest\r\nsister had gone to Germany to improve herself in the language. On\r\narriving in the place arranged, however, she found herself very\r\nuncomfortable and unhappy, and informed her brother of the fact. With\r\ncharacteristic energy he set off at once, met his sister, arranged for\r\nher transference to more congenial surroundings, and in a little more\r\nthan a week was back to work again.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards he went off to Jedburgh to take up again his survey\r\nin the Cheviots. Here he made many friends, and during his stay in the\r\nregion acquired an intense love for the scenery of the hills, whose\r\nlong gentle slopes and soft melancholy always appealed to him more than\r\nthe stern grandeur of the Highlands. This feeling was perhaps not\r\nwholly æsthetic, however, for the district soon acquired associations\r\nfor him which are briefly hinted at in the diary for the year. This--of\r\nsomewhat unusual form--is adorned, oddly enough, with a portrait\r\nof John Stuart Mill as frontispiece. The philosopher’s serious,\r\nintellectual countenance has, it is to be feared in derision, been\r\ndecorated by the owner of the diary with a long pipe. It would indeed\r\nbe difficult to imagine two men of more different type; for James\r\nGeikie, the utilitarian’s long years of waiting and longing would have\r\nbeen as intolerable as the brief fever of the last days.\r\n\r\nThe entries in the diary are as usual short in the extreme, but under\r\n12th August, which it is carefully noted was a wet day, the diarist was\r\nat a picnic in the Cheviots. He adds the word “lost”? to the laconic\r\nentry. Later entries record calls made to Crailing Hall with brief\r\ncomments. About this time James Geikie was writing to his friend Mr\r\nHorne, saying:--“John Horne--come to the Cheviots.... I’ll do what I\r\ncan in the way of introductions.” Much of the letter is occupied with\r\ngeological matters, and the writer goes on to express a hope that he\r\nwon’t be asked to give a course of lectures to working-men during the\r\ncoming winter:--“I want all my time for literary work this winter,\r\nseeing that I have agreed to write two books--one for a London house,\r\nthe other for an Edinburgh one. Besides, I have at last made up my mind\r\nto go and get married, and as soon as I come across a likely girl, will\r\nlose no time in taking the grand header. I hope never to see another\r\nautumn as a bachelor. So what with hunting libraries for notes, and\r\nhunting up families for a nice wife, I have my winter’s work laid out\r\nbefore me.”\r\n\r\nIt will appear from this letter that James Geikie did not keep his\r\nheart on his sleeve. The letter is not perhaps wholly candid, but\r\ncandour was doubtless not to be expected at such a time.\r\n\r\nA few details may be added to make the story clear. None of the towns\r\nor hamlets at the foot of the Cheviots was near enough to form a good\r\ncentre of work, and the region being given up to large sheep farms,\r\nhabitations of any kind among the hills are few and scattered. Among\r\nJames Geikie’s acquaintances in the Jedburgh district was Mr Simson,\r\nOxnam Row, to whose farm on the lower slopes were added the hill\r\ngrazings higher up the Kale Water. Here, right among the hills, was\r\nthe old farmhouse of Buchtrig, in the occupation of a shepherd and\r\nhis wife, but with some rooms so furnished as to permit of the family\r\nmaking occasional visits to the region. Through Mr Simson James Geikie\r\nwas able to arrange for accommodation here in the early spring of\r\n1874 to facilitate his work. A few notes of his visit are left in his\r\nown handwriting, in what he styles a “Copy of a Fragment of some very\r\nancient Manuscript.” This opens as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n It happened once upon a time that a certain youth, who dreamed strange\r\n dreams and wandered about the hill-tops and sojourned in lonely\r\n places, came unto a lonely dwelling among the mountains and there\r\n abode for many days. And an old woman ministered unto his wants with\r\n fear and trembling, for she looked upon him as one that was beside\r\n himself. “Verily,” said she unto herself, “he looketh for some hidden\r\n treasure, and is a magician who smiteth the rocks with a hammer and\r\n writeth strange incantations and evil words in a book.” And she\r\n looked, and behold he brought with him from the mountains pieces of\r\n stone which he treasured and laid in safe places.... Now after many\r\n days the old woman, who was called Katie, put away her fear, for the\r\n young man seemed not to hold communication with the Evil One, neither\r\n was the smell of brimstone perceived in the place. And so she showed\r\n him much kindness, and baked cakes of flour upon the girdle and\r\n brought these to him, and eggs, yea, and much fine butter.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the early summer of the same year James Geikie went for his holiday\r\nto Skye and Lewis. Not long after his return he was invited to the\r\npicnic already mentioned, which, owing to the weather, was adjourned to\r\nBuchtrig farmhouse. The picnic was given by Mr Simson, and included his\r\nsister, Mrs Johnston, Crailing Hall, and her three daughters, with two\r\nof whom James Geikie was already acquainted. The MS. may be allowed to\r\ntake up the story at this point:--\r\n\r\n\r\n And so the days passed away, and the young man went into a far\r\n country, yea unto the furthermost isles of the sea. But in the\r\n fullness of time he returned, and found the place which had been a\r\n desert now filled with the hum of voices and laughter of damsels. And\r\n he looked, and behold there were chariots and a wagon filled with\r\n good things. And he entered into the house where he had sojourned\r\n aforetime, and lo! a fair damsel met him and bade him welcome. And\r\n she said unto him, “Enter now, and embrace my sisters and my mother,\r\n yea and my mother’s brother’s wife and her daughter.” And it was so.\r\n And when the young man entered into an upper room, behold a maiden\r\n stood near the window.... And his eyes followed her whithersoever\r\n she went--and he spoke unto her presently as one speaketh unto an\r\n old friend. And the sound of her voice was like the music of the\r\n birds in spring, and the heart of the young man began to sing a new\r\n song. Listen and ye shall hear what the young man sang: Here ends the\r\n Manuscript.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis happened in August, and before Christmas James Geikie was engaged\r\nto Mary, youngest daughter of Mr Johnston, Crailing Hall, to whom he\r\nwas married on 8th July 1875.\r\n\r\nBut in addition to what we may call the major associations with the\r\nCheviot region due to these incidents, he had many minor ones of a\r\npleasurable nature. He came into contact with all sorts of people in\r\nthe course of his wanderings, and in that sparsely peopled district it\r\nwas easy to make acquaintances. Among his temporary dwelling-places in\r\nthe hills was the little inn, called Carter Bar, which then stood on\r\nthe slopes of Carter Fell, and was but little more than a rest-house\r\nfor drovers going over the border into England with their sheep. On one\r\nstormy day in spring James Geikie was returning to this poor shelter\r\nover the moor, when he encountered an old lady, somewhat oddly dressed,\r\ndrenched with rain, and struggling against the wind. He went to her\r\nassistance, and she was glad to accept the offer of his arm to help\r\nher back to the inn. Here she borrowed dry garments from the hostess,\r\nand sat and talked over the fire with her new-found friend, who found\r\nher full of Border lore, while he no doubt contributed his full share\r\nto the conversation. Eventually, her own garments being dry, and she\r\nherself refreshed, the old lady drove off in a waiting carriage, urging\r\nJames Geikie to come to see her. She proved to be Lady John Scott, a\r\nwell-known Border personage, famous for her antiquarian tastes, her\r\nScotch songs, and her great individuality of character.\r\n\r\nAnother similar meeting which led to a long friendship, though it took\r\nplace several years later, may fitly find a place here. This was with\r\nSir George Douglas, of Springwood Park, Kelso, the author of _The New\r\nBorder Tales_, _Poems_, and a number of other works, many referring to\r\nthe Border region. Sir George has kindly supplied the following notes\r\nupon the subject:--\r\n\r\n\r\n I owed my acquaintance with the late Prof. Geikie to a chance meeting.\r\n Starting on a solitary walking-tour, in the summer vacation of the\r\n year 1878, I called at the Collingwood Arms, Cornhill, for tea, and\r\n found him there. He was not yet professor at that date, but was a\r\n member of H.M. Geological Survey, the work of which had brought him\r\n to Cornhill, where he was waiting for a train to Tweedmouth. He was\r\n then in the early prime of manhood, and his work being of a more\r\n active nature and taking him more into the open air, the cheery\r\n vigour which at all times characterised him was more pleasantly\r\n noticeable than ever. I remember that his beard, which he afterwards\r\n wore close-cropped, at that time descended over his chest and was\r\n of a golden colour. I believe that we began by talking of inns, for\r\n I remember that he poked some good-natured fun at the commercial\r\n travellers of those days (“bagmen,” as he perversely preferred to call\r\n them), and told me two or three amusing stories of experiences with\r\n them. But, ere long, we were talking of literature, and especially\r\n of poetry--the poetry of the day. Here was a delight for me! I was\r\n at the poetry-reading age, and had just left Cambridge, where I had\r\n primed myself with Swinburne, William Morris, the Rossettis--that is,\r\n with such of their works as had at that date appeared; and not only\r\n with these, but with such poems as the “Angel in the House,” “White\r\n Rose and Red,” “The Human Tragedy”: the works of lesser masters, then\r\n on their probation, and now, it may be, seldom heard of. Well, here\r\n in a wayside inn at the extremity of Northumberland, I had chanced\r\n upon an unknown traveller who had all these authors and books, so to\r\n speak, at his fingers’ ends. One would have liked, at that age, to\r\n pose him, to make some pedantical allusion, as to a matter of common\r\n knowledge, to something of which he had not happened to hear. But\r\n it was vain to hope to go beyond him. And, if we were fairly evenly\r\n matched in our discussion, it must be borne in mind that I was, as\r\n it were, staking my all in it, whilst he was merely gambling with\r\n his small change. For of course he never professed literature, but\r\n merely turned to it for a change of idea in hours that were not\r\n occupied by science. What was really remarkable in this conversation,\r\n I should say, was the readiness and whole-heartedness with which\r\n he threw himself into it, the stimulus given by his never-failing\r\n interest and occasional enthusiasm, the fine good-nature with which\r\n he unquestioningly put himself on equal terms with one who was many\r\n years younger than himself, and whose opinions, however confidently\r\n expressed, must often have been crude and immature. Neither then, nor\r\n at any subsequent time, was there anything whatever that was pedantic\r\n or academic about Geikie. When I met him next, I was approaching the\r\n middle term of life, but the recollection of that single conversation\r\n suffices to make quite clear to me the power which he wielded over\r\n his students and the popularity which he enjoyed among them. I doubt\r\n if the very best that was in him really made itself felt upon the\r\n lecture-platform. It was in the give-and-take of life--in his Saturday\r\n geological tramps and other more informal relations with his students,\r\n if I may hazard a guess--that the man really stood revealed. He could\r\n impart life and glow to his subject, as perhaps few can. But he did\r\n so best, if I may pretend to judge, when he was talking rather than\r\n lecturing.\r\n\r\n I had evidence of this later. On parting after our two or three\r\n hours’ talk at Cornhill, we had exchanged cards, and when I heard\r\n that, in order to be near Mrs Geikie’s relations, he was renting\r\n Kalemouth on Teviot, four or five miles from my house, during one\r\n summer vacation, I hastened to renew acquaintance with him. Since\r\n our former meeting ten or twelve years had passed, and though it had\r\n remained delightfully memorable to me, I did not presume to suppose\r\n that he would remember it, nor was any allusion made to it. Being such\r\n near neighbours throughout that summer we met often, and it was then\r\n that I really got to know the character and qualities which had been\r\n merely suggested at Cornhill. From the geological point of view, Prof.\r\n Geikie knew the Borderland as no one else knew it; but he had also a\r\n remarkable knowledge, not only of its scenery, history, and tradition,\r\n but also of its people, collectively and individually; and this gave\r\n us a strong interest in common.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome other moorland experiences were of a more humorous nature. Thus\r\none Sunday night he was walking back from Crailing Hall to his lodgings\r\nat Morebattle, and came in the dusk past the hamlet of Cessford. He\r\nwas carrying a small handbag, and as he passed the cottages a woman\r\nran out and called out in a loud whisper:--“Man, man, can ye gie me\r\nhalf a pound o’ tea?” She had mistaken him for a pedlar, perhaps not\r\nunwilling to earn an ungodly penny. The situation appealed strongly\r\nto his sense of humour, and he rated the woman severely for tempting\r\nan honest man on the “Sawbath” day, and told her to go home and make\r\nporridge. For him the jest was doubtless seasoned by the fact that\r\nrigid “Sabbath-keeping” did not appeal to his tastes, and that he was\r\nan inveterate tea-drinker--making up for enforced abstinence while out\r\non the hills by copious draughts at night. Thus to bring down, as it\r\nwere, two birds with one stone--the rigid Sabbatarians, and those who\r\ntrace the degeneracy of the Scottish people to the substitution of\r\ntea for the ancestral porridge--must have been a real joy to him. The\r\noccasion perhaps permits of the comment that though a Scotsman, he\r\nwas a Scotsman with a difference, and had wandered too far, alike in\r\nmind and in body, to have any intense attachment to the pattern of the\r\nparish pump.\r\n\r\nThe spring of 1875, which saw him still working in the Cheviots,\r\nbrought him his first great honour--the fellowship of the Royal Society\r\nof London. A note, undated, written from Morebattle to his future wife,\r\nimmediately after he had received the news, is full of justifiable\r\npride and joy:--“I suppose I am the youngest F.R.S. on the roll ... you\r\nwill believe me, I know, when I say that I am pleased as much for your\r\nsake as my own, that my work is recognised. It is no small honour to\r\nbe elected F.R.S. out of 57 candidates for the 15 vacancies.” The note\r\nencloses two letters, one from his old friend and honoured chief, Prof.\r\nRamsay, saying:--“You came in triumphantly yesterday for the Royal\r\nSociety, having the largest number of votes of any candidate,” and\r\nanother from Mr H. W. Bristow, the Director of the Geological Survey of\r\nEngland and Wales, which shows clearly with what friendly feeling James\r\nGeikie was regarded by his English colleagues:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  28 JERMYN ST., S.W.,\r\n  _17th April 1875_.\r\n\r\n MY DEAR JAMES GEIKIE,--It gladdens my heart as one of your “Royal”\r\n sponsors, to congratulate you upon your election into _the_ Society,\r\n which I hope you may live long to adorn. Etheridge[3] is also very\r\n full of rejoicing, and I only regret that the earliest announcement of\r\n the glad tidings did not reach you from one of us.--Believe me, your\r\n faithful confrère,\r\n\r\n  H. W. BRISTOW.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [3] Mr R. Etheridge, another member of the Survey staff.\r\n\r\nAs the Survey work in the Cheviot region was finished in the year that\r\nJames Geikie married, his friend Prof. Ramsay so arranged matters that\r\nit was possible for him to take a house at Perth, which remained his\r\nheadquarters for six years after his marriage, that is until he went to\r\nEdinburgh to take the Chair of Geology.\r\n\r\nAt Perth Mr and Mrs Geikie made many friends, and the former threw\r\nhimself actively into the life of the place, taking especially a great\r\ninterest in the Perthshire Society of Natural Science, of which he\r\nbecame president later. This brought him into contact with Sir Thomas\r\nMoncrieffe, also at one time president of the Society; Mr Andrew\r\nCoates, who took a very great interest in the establishment of the\r\nexcellent Perth Museum; Dr Buchanan White, and others. James Geikie\r\nalso gave courses of lectures to ladies on geology during his stay\r\nin Perth, and generally did not a little to stimulate an interest in\r\nnatural science in the town.\r\n\r\nThe year 1876 was a very full one. In spring he paid a short visit to\r\nNorfolk and Suffolk to study some interesting glacial results which\r\nhis colleague Mr Skertchly had obtained there. At the same time he was\r\nworking at _The Great Ice Age_, which had done so well that a second\r\nedition was required. Under date 27th June he writes to Mr Horne:--“My\r\nnew edition will be out, I expect, in October--the first of the season!\r\nIt is in the printers’ hands now, and we are settling about the size of\r\npage and type. Printed the same size of type as last, the volume would\r\nbe 900 pages, which shows that I have made some additions!”\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of July Prof. Ramsay wrote to ask him if he would\r\nbe willing to go to Gibraltar to assist in an investigation of the\r\nwater-supply there, the work to count as a piece of Survey duty. The\r\ninvitation was promptly accepted, and on 11th September James Geikie\r\nleft Perth on his long journey to the South. He stopped a couple\r\nof days in London, and did not finally reach Gibraltar till 19th\r\nSeptember. Here he remained till 25th October, much longer than he had\r\nexpected, and in addition to doing a large amount of geological work,\r\nin what both he and Prof. Ramsay found most oppressive heat, received\r\nmuch kindness and hospitality from the civil and military officials,\r\nand made many interesting excursions. It was apparently the first\r\ntime he had seen subtropical vegetation, and his letters to his wife\r\nare filled with accounts of all he saw, written in a spirit of almost\r\nboyish glee, and accompanied by much groaning over the heat, and the\r\nresultant thirst. Even bathing afforded little refreshment, for he says\r\nruefully:--“Even in the water one has much the feeling that a herring\r\nmust have when it is newly put into a pot upon the fire. All the\r\nsprings,” he adds, “yield half-warm water--everything indeed is baked,\r\nblistered, and boiled.”\r\n\r\nThe abundant hospitality, delightful though it was, naturally took\r\nup much time, the hosts perhaps not fully realising that the two\r\ngeologists had a fairly heavy piece of work on hand, and James Geikie\r\ncomplains that it was difficult even to find time to write letters to\r\nhis wife, in the midst of the ceaseless round of work and pleasure. An\r\ninteresting fact, which he does not fail to record, is that at a Mess\r\ndinner at which he and Prof. Ramsay were the guests of honour, the\r\nmilitary band played Scotch music in compliment to their nationality,\r\nand among the airs James Geikie recognised a selection arranged by his\r\nfather for a Scotch regiment many years before.\r\n\r\nAmong the excursions was included one to the African coast, where\r\nthe two made a short stay in Tangier: the diary, with characteristic\r\norderliness, records the purchases made here for the people at home.\r\nBut in addition to making these, the two found time to study the\r\ngeology of the coast between Ceuta and Cape Spartel.\r\n\r\nA letter to Mr Horne, written from Perth on 18th November, not long\r\nafter his return home, makes some mention of the tour, and of the other\r\nevents of a crowded summer.\r\n\r\n\r\n I heard all about your Shetland work. It did my heart good, and\r\n right glad I am that it has been done by a Survey man.... You would\r\n hear about Skertchly’s find. I was down there again ten days ago at\r\n Ramsay’s request, to see the evidence again.... In my new edition,\r\n which is out (and selling well!), I go much more fully into the\r\n English Drifts. I got to-day a long letter from Darwin, along with a\r\n copy of his new edition of _Geological Observations_. His letter is\r\n very complimentary, and of course that is gratifying to me, for I look\r\n upon Darwin as a real genius.\r\n\r\n I enjoyed my Gibraltar trip very much. Ramsay was very jolly and in\r\n excellent spirits all the time. We did have some fun, I can tell\r\n you. Also we crossed over to Africa and had a run amongst the Moors.\r\n The result of our Survey was so far satisfactory as it enables us\r\n to say very positively what is best to be done in the matter of the\r\n water-supply.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two letters from Darwin about this date. One has been\r\nalready quoted (p. 27). In the other, which is taken up largely\r\nwith a geological discussion, he says:--“Allow me to tell you with\r\nwhat extreme pleasure and admiration I have just finished reading\r\nyour _Great Ice Age_. It seems to me admirably done and most clear.\r\nInteresting as many chapters are in the history of the world, I do\r\nnot think that any one comes nearly to the glacial period or periods.\r\nThough I have steadily read much on the subject, your book makes the\r\nwhole appear almost new to me.”\r\n\r\nIn this month of November also another sign of appreciation of his\r\nwork reached James Geikie in the offer by the University of St Andrews\r\nof its LL.D. degree, which was conferred the following year. About\r\nthe same time he was approached informally to know whether he would\r\ncare to have a knighthood. This was at this date a much rarer honour\r\nthan it became later, and the young couple decided that their income\r\nwas not large enough to support it. Very many years later, after his\r\nretirement, James Geikie’s friends again urged his claims to the title,\r\nbut the matter was dropped at the outbreak of the war, and death came\r\nnot long after.\r\n\r\nOther letters of the same autumn refer to the “Ice Age,” and to the\r\nreport upon the Gibraltar work. In addition to the _Memoir_ upon the\r\nquestion of the water-supply, a general article on the geology of the\r\nregion was contributed to the _Quarterly Journal of the Geological\r\nSociety_. Rather curiously, even at Gibraltar Geikie found evidence of\r\nuse to him in connection with his glacial work.\r\n\r\nIn the early spring of 1877 his eldest son was born, and the summer\r\nsaw him wandering about the Hebrides, of which he sends so racy a\r\ndescription to his wife that large extracts from the letters may be\r\ngiven:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  OBBE, HARRIS, _7th July 1877_.\r\n\r\n This is written out on the hill-side--I will tell you why presently.\r\n Yesterday we walked from Tarbert, twenty-three miles, by a wild and\r\n lonely track-road, through a desolate and dreary region--nothing\r\n but bare rock, and a little heather and grass growing in rocks and\r\n crevices. It was all very interesting to me, however, as every square\r\n yard of rock was marked and scored and smoothed by the great ice-sheet\r\n that flowed out from the mainland. We took our time by the way, making\r\n notes and sketches. Every now and then we passed standing stones and\r\n ruins of Picts houses. At each bend in the track there were always\r\n two or three cairns of stones, which mark the spots where coffins\r\n have been rested. When the Harris folk bury anyone they have to carry\r\n the body often for many miles, as there is only one burial-place for\r\n the island. The poor people must rest by the way, therefore, for\r\n refreshment. Much whisky and kebbocks of cheese and scones go down,\r\n and then they raise a cairn to mark the spot. We met no one all the\r\n way for fourteen miles.... The road wound along the sea coast, across\r\n which we had lovely views to the islets that dot the horizon. You\r\n have no idea of the lovely shades of blue and green and saffron and\r\n orange and gold that streak and flush the sea--the water is so clear\r\n and crystalline, too, that one feels as if he should like to throw\r\n his knapsack down and take a header! There are few or no houses. We\r\n passed the ruins of several villages, but the poor people were driven\r\n out some forty years ago, and most of them emigrated to Canada. I\r\n believe they were very unwilling to clear out, and the soldiers had\r\n to be marched upon them. It is very sad to see their poor huts, all\r\n roofless, and grass and nettles growing over them. As we had much to\r\n look at on the road it was nearly ten o’clock before we came to Obbe,\r\n and we passed the inn--not knowing it. Losh keep us a’, what an inn!\r\n It was a mere hut--just like that used by the “natives.” There are\r\n only two rooms--a kitchen and a double-bedded room. The peat-reek\r\n circulates freely through the whole cottage, and the walls are mouldy\r\n and damp. We had a peat fire in our room, and did what we could to\r\n make ourselves jolly. But salt ham is not good to feed on after a long\r\n walk. However, we were satisfied, and after a while got to bed.\r\n\r\n To-day we started to climb Roneval, the highest mountain in South\r\n Harris. It has been polished by ice all over, a splendid confirmation\r\n of what I had already described in my book. What a magnificent view\r\n I had from the top! Far away to the west was St Kilda and the little\r\n island of Berneray. Southwards stretched the various islands of the\r\n Outer Hebrides--North Uist, Benbecula, South Uist, and Barra. How\r\n plainly seen they all were--high mountains with broad plains at their\r\n feet, over which were dotted lakes innumerable. In the east, Skye with\r\n its wonderful Coolins lay spread out before us; and north of Skye I\r\n could see our old friend Ben Slioch, and the mountains of Loch Maree\r\n and Loch Torridon. Harris, of course, lay under our feet: and you can\r\n form no idea of its sterile desolation. Endless round-backed hills and\r\n rocks, scraped bare of any soil, and supporting hardly a vestige of\r\n vegetation; great rocky mountains, smoothed and polished all over and\r\n equally bare and desolate, with blue lakelets scattered in hundreds\r\n among the hollows and depressions of the land--such is the appearance\r\n of Harris. Then there lay the great blue sea shining like sapphire in\r\n the sun, and flecked with tiny sails where the fishermen are busy at\r\n their calling.--I began this letter outside to escape the peat-reek,\r\n but the midges have driven me in again!\r\n\r\n\r\n  LOCHMADDY, NORTH UIST,\r\n\r\n  _Tuesday, 10th July 1877_.\r\n\r\n We got here yesterday, after a long and very tedious sail in an open\r\n boat. With a good wind we should have crossed the Sound of Harris\r\n in two hours--instead of which we were nine hours. We kept dodging\r\n about from islet to islet, sighing for a breeze, but no breeze would\r\n come--what little wind there was being in the wrong direction. We\r\n landed hungry as hawks, or any other animal of prey, and found a very\r\n comfortable inn. Of course we were offered the usual ham and eggs,\r\n but prevailed upon the landlady to give us fish instead. This place\r\n is like the sweepings of creation. It is made up of irregular bits of\r\n land, all jumbled about in a shallow sea--or of bits of sea running\r\n into the flat land in all directions--so that to get to a place one\r\n mile in direct distance you may have to walk five or six or even\r\n ten miles, if you can’t get a boat. It is a land of desolation and\r\n dreariness. Bare rocky hills form the eastern coast, and from the\r\n foot of these the low undulating rocky and peaty land stretches for\r\n some ten or twelve miles to the Atlantic. The land, as I have said,\r\n is everywhere intersected by the sea, and sprinkled with innumerable\r\n lakes and peaty tarns. Along the flat Atlantic coast there are dreary\r\n stretches of blown yellow sands that form hills like those of Barry,\r\n near Carnoustie. Near these are a few huts and a kirk and manse! Not a\r\n tree, not even a bush higher than heather is anywhere to be seen--peat\r\n and rock and water--water and rock and peat--that is North Uist.... I\r\n have been vastly pleased with what I have seen, and will have a lot to\r\n tell geologists that is new.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CAIRNISH, NORTH UIST,\r\n\r\n  _11th July 1877_.\r\n\r\n This place is still further out of the world than Lochmaddy. We walked\r\n to it to-day accompanied by one of the Inland Revenue officers, a\r\n very good intelligent fellow, who is quite an antiquarian and takes\r\n an intelligent interest in geology. He knew of me quite well and had\r\n read my “great work.” The road lay for twelve miles through bogs,\r\n morasses, rocks, and lakes, and passed over as dreary a stretch of\r\n country as I ever set eyes on. The sky was cold grey, and the wind too\r\n was none of the kindest. Here we found a wretched inn, where we were\r\n waited on by a great hulking Heeland lassie with a back as broad as\r\n a barn door, and bare feet which haven’t been in a tub since the day\r\n she saw the light of this weary world. She is shy, the dear creature,\r\n and has not one word of English. When I ring for her with the bell\r\n that lies on the table, she looks into the room with a grin on her\r\n face. I want salt, so I take up a bit of the Australian meat and dab\r\n it on the side of the plate. She twigs at once what I want, makes a\r\n guttural sound, and in half-an-hour or so returns with a soap-dish\r\n full of dirty salt. However, she gives us good scones and not bad tea,\r\n and strong peat-reekie whisky. The landlord has been a soldier, I\r\n think, for he speaks of Hyderabad. Fancy a man coming from the sunny\r\n plains of India to this fearful howling wilderness. It would make\r\n a fine penal settlement. You see poor, ragged, dirty women bending\r\n under their creels of peat, and men digging the mosses as for dear\r\n life. It is hard living for them, poor devils. There is no shelter in\r\n the land, even the heather is low and stunted, and the wind howls in\r\n from the Atlantic with a long melancholy sough that is depressing in\r\n the extreme. No sportsman ever comes here, for there is nothing to\r\n shoot. It is said that there are fine trout in the lakes. It may be\r\n so; but the man who could fish such peaty holes and feel happy in the\r\n occupation, could only be an escaped convict or downright lunatic.\r\n The inn at Lochmaddy was snug, if the country was miserable. Here\r\n everything is in keeping.... Most of the houses are mere stone-and-mud\r\n huts with mud floors and heather roofs. Cattle enter them freely and\r\n mingle with the family. I was amused with an old man who came up to\r\n us and asked our friend the Inland Revenue man what we were doing. He\r\n took us for drovers come to buy cattle. When he heard that we had come\r\n to look at rocks and stones he said--“We were great fools, and must\r\n be very idle, and light in the head.” And indeed when I looked round\r\n the miserable dreary wilderness I was half inclined to agree with him.\r\n Who but a geologist would ever think of visiting such a land. Well, it\r\n won’t be my fault if I ever revisit the place.\r\n\r\n\r\n  LOCH BOISDALE, _15th July 1877_.\r\n\r\n Some days have passed since I last had an opportunity of writing to\r\n you. We have had much walking and no time to write since we left\r\n Cairnish in South Uist. We started from Cairnish about twelve o’clock\r\n on the 11th in a broken-down gig with a one-eyed horse, which was led\r\n or rather pulled along by a native named Angus Macdougall.... North\r\n Uist and Benbecula are separated by an arm of the sea which is some\r\n five miles in breadth, but is so shallow that at low water it can be\r\n forded. What a peculiar scene it was! A long stretch of mud-flats and\r\n sand-banks broken here and there with reefs of tangle-covered rocks\r\n and low green islets on which a few black cattle were grazing. Men\r\n and women were busy cutting the tangle for kelp-burning, the smoke of\r\n the fires rising here and there from various points of the dry land\r\n on the Benbecula coast. Heavy drizzle wetted me through and through,\r\n and it was most cheerless. At the opposite side of the ford we reached\r\n a little inn, as dirty and clarty as all the inns are. We now got\r\n out of the trap to walk, as we wished to save the poor horse as much\r\n as possible, for the weary tramp before us. At the pace we went we\r\n calculated we should reach Loch Boisdale about two or three in the\r\n morning. Benbecula is about eight or nine miles in length, and is\r\n perhaps the dreariest bit of land I ever traversed. It is nothing but\r\n a big peat-moss, with a lot of lakes or boggy holes running through\r\n it in all directions. Indeed there is about as much water as land.\r\n Cultivation is a mere parody, everything bespeaks poverty. The people\r\n are as usual haggard and ill-clad, and dirty in the extreme. Things\r\n looked a little better as we got near the shore at Creagorry. Here\r\n our friend Mr Carmichael met us and took us into his house.... It\r\n was pleasant to get into a real house again and to sleep in a clean\r\n comfortable bed. Next morning we were up at three o’clock in order to\r\n catch the early ford between Benbecula and South Uist.... The ford\r\n between Benbecula and South Uist is not nearly so broad as the North\r\n Ford, but it is deeper. We got across about half-past four, and then I\r\n got out to walk so that I might make observations as I went along. It\r\n rained heavily for the first six miles and then cleared off, so that\r\n I had time to dry again. The road goes through much the same kind of\r\n scenery as Benbecula, but there are fine mountains immediately to the\r\n left, and these we gradually neared, and skirted the base of them for\r\n many miles. I saw so much glacial geology that I did not feel in the\r\n least degree fatigued.... As we took our time by the way, stopping to\r\n look at this, that, and t’other thing, it was nearly eight o’clock\r\n when we reached a place called Askernish about six miles or so from\r\n Loch Boisdale.... At five we set off again, and loitering by the way\r\n to chat and smoke and do geology, we did not get into Loch Boisdale\r\n until nine o’clock at night, having been out since four o’clock in the\r\n morning. So off to bed somewhat fagged. Next morning we were astir by\r\n six o’clock and set off in a boat for a sixteen-miles sail up the east\r\n coast to Loch Eynort, intending to land there and climb Ben More, the\r\n highest hill in South Uist. It was wet and cold, but we determined\r\n to go on. The cliffs are wild and dreary, and fearful places to be\r\n wrecked upon, for deep water runs up to the very rocks. We landed at\r\n a place where Prince Charlie lay in hiding while the King’s cruisers\r\n sailed past. It was a picturesque spot. Wild bare mountains cleft\r\n by mountain-torrents surrounded the small glen, down which leapt a\r\n noisy stream, on the bank of which were one or two thatched cots. The\r\n shepherd came out and asked us to drink milk. It was a picturesque\r\n interior that we were introduced to. There was the peat fire in the\r\n centre, dogs, cocks and hens, cats, and a small pig crowded round the\r\n fire, and the wife and lassies were bustling about. The spinning-jenny\r\n stood in a corner. None of the women looked well. They were all white\r\n and haggard. Carmichael told me afterwards that they wanted me to\r\n prescribe for them, as they had imagined I was a medical man! Poor\r\n things! I could not help thinking they were consumptive. Yet they all\r\n seemed happy enough, and certainly though I have seen much poverty\r\n all through these islands, yet I have not noticed any of that squalid\r\n misery which is so common in our large towns. The people are poor, but\r\n they always have something to eat. Their wardrobe can’t cost much, for\r\n they make everything themselves, and what they make seems to last half\r\n a lifetime. But to return to the shepherd’s house, we got our milk\r\n and after sitting for a while rose to go. They are very polite these\r\n Highlanders, much more so than most country folks in the mainland of\r\n Scotland. I was only sorry I could not speak Gaelic, for few of them\r\n had more than one or two words of English. The shepherd told us it\r\n had been a bad year for the sheep, but not so bad, he thought, as it\r\n seems to have been on the mainland. We bade good-bye and sailed into\r\n Loch Eynort at a wild part of the coast, where we landed and dismissed\r\n the boatmen and boat. But mists hung heavy on all the hills, and after\r\n much climbing we were compelled much against our will to give up all\r\n hope of getting to the top of Ben More. However, we managed to see a\r\n good deal, and then struck right across the mountain tract to the flat\r\n ground of the east coast, along which we had walked the day before.\r\n Just before we got down to the road, the mists cleared away, and the\r\n mountain-peak shone brilliantly forth; but it was now too late to\r\n think of climbing Ben More. We had been tramping over rock and bog and\r\n hill and dale for six hours, and we had still some twelve miles to\r\n walk before reaching Loch Boisdale, and were reluctantly obliged to\r\n abandon Ben More. But I was able nevertheless to make out all the main\r\n geological points that were important--so that, after all, we did not\r\n lose much.... I shall be right glad when my face is homeward turned.\r\n It is so wet and dismal it makes one dull whether he will or no. But\r\n I have very much enjoyed my visit, and have gathered material for a\r\n great geological paper, which will bring me much credit, I know.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rest of the year 1877 was occupied with the writing of the Hebrides\r\npaper, published in the following year, and in various geological\r\ncontroversies, especially in regard to the superficial deposits of\r\nNorfolk and Suffolk. These years at Perth were thus a period of severe\r\nand productive work, for after long days in the field he would sit\r\nand write far into the night. He kept himself also carefully abreast\r\nof all recent work in his own subject, and with the help of grammars\r\nand dictionaries, read in the original the papers of all his foreign\r\nconfrères, Norwegian, Danish, Swedish, etc. The Norwegian geologist,\r\nDr Amund Helland, afterwards professor at Christiania, it may be\r\nnoted, paid a visit to the house at Perth in 1877, and James Geikie\r\nand he became great friends. A couple of years later they paid a visit\r\ntogether, an enjoyable and profitable one, to the Färoe Islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nLAST YEARS ON THE SURVEY\r\n\r\n1878-1882\r\n\r\n\r\nThe spring of 1878 saw James Geikie engaged in active correspondence\r\nwith Prof. Ramsay in regard to their joint paper on the Gibraltar work,\r\nand also occupied, in his own words, in fighting with wild beasts at\r\nEphesus and elsewhere, that is to say, in sundry controversies over\r\nglacial matters.\r\n\r\nHis happiness at home was clouded by the severe illness of his little\r\nson. In his letters he speaks of being knocked up with night-nursing,\r\nfor he walked up and down the greater part of the night with the child\r\nin his arms during the most anxious period. Happily the baby made a\r\ngood recovery, and in a letter to Mr Horne towards the end of the year\r\nhe says:--“‘The boy’ is hale and flourishing, and a great amusement in\r\nthe evenings when I come home. I prefer his company even to that of a\r\npipe! Excuse the ‘eavy fawther.’” He was very fond of children at all\r\ntimes, and his own were a source of great joy to him.\r\n\r\nIn summer he went back to the Cheviot region for a couple of months to\r\nfinish off his work there, and revisited Buchtrig. It was during this\r\nvisit that he met Sir George Douglas (_cf._ p. 67). In August he went\r\nabroad with his wife and her sister, the baby, now quite recovered,\r\nbeing left with his grandmother. The tour was _via_ the Rhine to\r\nSwitzerland, and then across the St Gothard by carriage into Italy.\r\nSome interesting letters to the home people record the experiences met\r\nwith, but as the ground covered is very well known they need not be\r\nquoted here. During the course of the tour some geological observations\r\nwere made bearing on points treated in _Prehistoric Europe_, which was\r\nbeing written during this year.\r\n\r\nSigns of overwork and some worry were, however, observable as the year\r\nwent on. In an undated letter to Mr Horne he complains of not feeling\r\ngood for much:--“I was busy at a new book, but being in the blues now\r\nfor some time, the MS. lies aside, and I sometimes wonder whether I\r\nshall ever finish it. I thought my trip abroad would have cleared up my\r\nfaculties, but no such luck!”\r\n\r\nAmong his causes for anxiety were his own future and that of the\r\nSurvey. Prof. Ramsay’s health was breaking down, a fact which grieved\r\nJames Geikie very much, and the possibility that difficult days for the\r\nSurvey and its members were coming loomed ahead. In an unwonted fit of\r\nmelancholy he says in the same letter:--“It makes one sad to think that\r\nthe ‘brave days of old’ are all passing or past away. One gets sick of\r\nthe strife and din and wishes for peace and rest, which, however, will\r\nonly come when one shuts his eyes for the last time.” He found also\r\nthat his distance from a good library was a great drawback in his work.\r\nThe letter, with all its sadness, speaks of the pleasure which he found\r\nin the company of the “small chick,” who seems to have had a potent\r\ncharm wherewith to dispel his father’s clouds of gloom.\r\n\r\nAmong the letters of the spring of 1879 are several to Mr Lamplugh,\r\nnow of the Geological Survey. In regard to these Mr Lamplugh says:--“I\r\ndo not know that they contain anything that is now of sufficient\r\nconsequence to warrant their reproduction. But they illustrate very\r\nwell the kindly attention and trouble that the late Prof. Geikie was\r\nalways ready to give to a beginner in science. I was under twenty years\r\nof age when the first of these letters came to me, and I have kept them\r\nas treasures from those days.”\r\n\r\nThe letters in their friendliness and unaffectedness bear out this\r\ndescription, and some other letters of the same period show that\r\nwhile the writer was never deaf to the appeal of a common interest\r\nin the progress of knowledge, when to this was added the stronger\r\nappeal of friendship, he gave himself whole-heartedly. His friends\r\nMessrs Peach and Horne had written a paper on “The Glaciation of the\r\nShetland Islands” for the Geological Society of London, and in this\r\nJames Geikie took the keenest interest, giving advice freely both on\r\nthe method of presenting the contents, and on the technical points\r\nconnected with the effort to obtain for the paper a fair hearing and\r\nspeedy publication. A hitch in the matter of publication brings from\r\nhim a letter full of genuine and practical sympathy, combined with a\r\nwhole-hearted espousal of his friends’ cause.\r\n\r\nDuring this spring also he was still engaged, with varying fortunes,\r\nupon his _Prehistoric Europe_, a task of great magnitude on account of\r\nthe enormous number of references and the labour which these involved.\r\nThus a letter written early in March represents, as it were, the trough\r\nof the wave--he tires of the book at intervals, thinking it will never\r\ndo, and throws it aside in a “kind o’ scunner.” Another letter at the\r\nend of May shows him on the crest of a new wave of enthusiasm. He had\r\njust received many new pamphlets from “furrin’ parts,” mostly inspired\r\nby his own glacial work, often accompanied by letters from the authors.\r\nThus he says:--\r\n\r\n\r\n Dr A. Penck of Leipzig writes to the effect that it was the reading\r\n of _Great Ice Age_ that first opened his eyes to the meaning of the\r\n Diluvium of Northern Germany. He says he has got evidence of three\r\n glaciations with intervening glacial deposits! He says he has all the\r\n burning enthusiasm of a convert! His letter has greatly gratified me,\r\n of course. I see he is an old hand and has done a lot of geological\r\n work. Then I have a long letter from a Dr R. Lehmann of Halle, who is\r\n also congratulatory at the success with which the German Drifts have\r\n recently been explained on the principles laid down in my book!! Also,\r\n some duffers have sent me their photographs! I wonder what has so\r\n suddenly wakened them up. Helland has a long and interesting paper on\r\n the German Drift which I suppose you will see: also a batch of papers\r\n on same subject from Prof. Berendt of Berlin. I don’t know how I am\r\n to get through all the Swedish and Norwegian papers I have received.\r\n They are so hard to read.\r\n\r\n\r\nA postscript to this letter says:--“Pray excuse the exulting egotism of\r\nthis epistle. I would not write so to anyone else.”\r\n\r\nBut while glacial work was thus occupying most of his attention,\r\nlighter subjects were not altogether forgotten. In another letter to Mr\r\nHorne, written on Good Friday, he says:--\r\n\r\n\r\n In a few days I am going to ask you to do me a favour, which is to\r\n run your eye over some MS. I shall send you. You need not read it all\r\n through--that would be too much of a good thing--but just dip into\r\n it here and there, and see what it is like. You will laugh when I\r\n tell you that the MS. is poetry, translations from the German. These\r\n have been lying beside me for some ten or twelve years. I was urged\r\n by several friends of good judgment to publish them long ago. But I\r\n would not be induced to do so, so I laid them aside until I had quite\r\n forgotten them and could read them and criticise them as if they had\r\n been the lucubrations of another man. They bore this better than I\r\n expected, and I gathered together all I could find and have had them\r\n copied out and stitched into a volume.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps needless to say that this MS. was the translation of\r\nHeine’s poems, of which mention has already been made here repeatedly.\r\nThe intention to publish at this time was abandoned, partly because of\r\nthe possible effect on the “new book,” i.e., _Prehistoric Europe_.\r\n\r\nDuring this spring James Geikie was also corresponding with Dr Helland\r\non glacial topics, and had arranged to accompany him to the Färoe\r\nIslands, to study the glacial phenomena there. A start was made at\r\nthe end of May, and the two spent a delightful time together, Prof.\r\nHelland’s knowledge of the language being a great help. James Geikie’s\r\npaper on his observations was published a year or two later, and his\r\nnote-books contain long descriptions of his experiences, with many\r\nsketches and diagrams. A more informal account is given in a letter to\r\nMrs Johnston of Crailing Hall:--\r\n\r\n\r\n I enjoyed my trip very much though I had to rough it more than most\r\n people would care to do. But what I saw was quite enough to make me\r\n forget all discomforts. Perhaps the most striking features of the\r\n Färoe Islands are their sea-cliffs. These range in height from 300\r\n feet to 2000 feet. I sailed in a little boat round a large part of the\r\n coast-line and was very much impressed. The cliffs rise sheer up out\r\n of deep water, seeming in some places almost to overhang. Fancy the\r\n sun shining brightly on a great wall of brown rock 2000 feet high--a\r\n wall which shows an infinite number of little shelves and ledges, and\r\n all these ledges thickly set with sea-birds in myriads, while the air\r\n is filled with them, wheeling and screaming above you, and the water\r\n is alive with them swimming, diving, floating, and capering! The great\r\n Atlantic rollers come smoothly up to the base of the cliffs and sweep\r\n into the caves, only to rush out again with a hoarse roar, and a wild\r\n splash of spray and broken water.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot very long after his return from the Färoes, at the end of July, his\r\nsecond son was born.\r\n\r\nSeveral letters from Prof. Ramsay, on the Färoes work and other\r\nsubjects, in the course of the summer show the friendly terms upon\r\nwhich the two were. Thus in announcing that he (Ramsay) had been chosen\r\nPresident of the British Association for the Swansea meeting in 1880,\r\nhe adds:--“And unless you write the Presidential Address for me, I\r\nwill take steps to have you dismissed from the Survey!” Unfortunately\r\nfor James Geikie, the time during which Ramsay had anything to say upon\r\nSurvey matters was fast drawing to a close. A few days later Ramsay\r\nwrites in jubilant spirits because their joint work at Gibraltar had\r\nproved correct, although certain borings had seemed at first to cast\r\ndoubt upon some of their conclusions. Prof. Ramsay’s feelings in the\r\nmatter are expressed as follows:--“Ho ho ho! Ha ha ha! also he he he!”\r\nIn the same letter Ramsay speaks of Prof. Penck’s results, saying:--“It\r\nis a grand coup for you.”\r\n\r\nAmong James Geikie’s other correspondents this summer were Prof.\r\nStevenson of New York, a very warm friend of later years after the\r\ntwo had met in the flesh, and Mr T. F. Jamieson, who like Ramsay was\r\ngreatly interested in the Färoes work. Towards the end of the year he\r\nwrites to Mr Horne:--\r\n\r\n\r\n I have recently got heaps of new facts from Germany, France, and\r\n Austria, not to mention Italy, which will greatly aid me in working\r\n off my present book. That same book drags its slow length along, but I\r\n hope to finish it in time for publication next year.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter giving a general sketch of the contents of the book he goes on:--\r\n\r\n\r\n My references to foreign writers will astonish you with their “learned\r\n profundity”--what do you think of Italian, Greek, Spanish, Austrian,\r\n German, Hungarian, French, Danish, Dutch, Russian, Swedish, Norwegian,\r\n and Icelandic references! The time I have spent over these with\r\n grammar and dictionary, and the trouble in having others translated\r\n for me by learned pundits, are such that I will never, I think,\r\n undertake anything of the kind again. Sometimes two or three long\r\n nights’ work is summed up in a short line; or even has no mention at\r\n all! I only hope the result will justify the time expended. It is all\r\n intensely interesting, however.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps it may be well to repeat in connection with this letter that\r\nthis laborious work was the occupation of what should have been leisure\r\nhours, and that in addition to it James Geikie was putting in some\r\neight or nine hours’ work per day in the field or at office work, was\r\ncarrying on an extensive correspondence, was lecturing in various parts\r\nof Scotland, and was writing scientific papers. Much of his writing had\r\nthus to be done by curtailing the hours of sleep, and most of those who\r\ncame into close contact with him at this time regarded his capacity for\r\nwork as something almost superhuman. But despite his heavy labours,\r\nthis year seems to have been a happy one, and perhaps helped him to\r\nbear the period of storm and stress which was to come.\r\n\r\nThe chief incident of the following year, 1880, was the completion\r\nand publication of _Prehistoric Europe_, and the letters are full\r\nof allusions to it. Thus towards the end of January he writes to Mr\r\nHorne:--“Still grinding away at my tome. Got about a third to write\r\nyet. The thing swells out, I am sorry to say; there is so much more to\r\ntell than I had any idea of.” The severity of the strain was, however,\r\nobviously telling upon him, for only a week or two later he says:--“All\r\nat present is at a standstill. My head has given up work, and I must\r\nleave it alone a little: been going at it early and late too much!”\r\nA little later he says again:--“I am going to rest and do nothing but\r\nread. You have no idea what a loathing one takes to paper and pen\r\nsometimes! But doubtless you have the same.”\r\n\r\nIt was nearly the end of July before the MS. was finally completed, and\r\nthe nature of the effort is indicated by the fact that the concluding\r\nsentences of the book were written in his sleep! He was working at it\r\nas usual till far into the night, and could not find a fitting sentence\r\nto round off the whole. After trying for some time ineffectively, he\r\ndecided to leave the matter till the morning, and went off to bed, the\r\ntime being 2 A.M. In his usual orderly fashion he had placed the last\r\nsheets on his writing-table, putting two books on top to prevent the\r\npapers from being scattered by a chance draught. In the morning he\r\nfound them scattered over the table, to his great disgust, for it was\r\na stern household regulation that papers were _taboo_ for all hands\r\nsave their owner’s. The maid when taxed, however, denied indignantly\r\nthat she had touched them, and when the injured author gathered up his\r\ntreasures he was astonished to find, written in his own handwriting,\r\nthough not with his usual neatness, the sentence which now stands as\r\nthe final one. Evidently he had dropped to sleep and come down to\r\ncomplete the unfinished task in a subconscious condition. The story\r\nshows clearly that it was time the book was done with.\r\n\r\nBut the labour did not cease with the completion of the MS. The\r\nholiday, which began early in August, was spent partly in London,\r\nlooking up final references, and partly in South Wales, with a view to\r\nmaking out some further glacial points. A letter to Mr Horne suggests\r\nthe mixed feelings which the completion of the task brought. He\r\nsays:--“I am well pleased now to have the thing off my hands. I will\r\nnot soon begin another such work. It is too much worry and labour--and\r\nyet pleasant withal.” Later he writes:--“Now that my book is off my\r\nhands, time in the evenings hangs heavy on my hands”--the Nemesis, a\r\npsychologist would say, of overwork, for it was obviously the condition\r\nwhen nothing but work had become possible!\r\n\r\nVarious pleasant little incidents, however, occurred this autumn. Thus\r\nthe French geologists, MM. Falsan and Chantre, sent him a copy of\r\ntheir Monograph on the old glaciers of the Rhone basin. In sending the\r\nbook M. Falsan spoke with gratifying warmth of _The Great Ice Age_,\r\nand of the many new ideas which he and his confrère had obtained from\r\nits perusal. “I feel as if I shall get cocky,” says James Geikie in a\r\nletter, “and, as pride goes before a fall, am beginning to dread lest\r\n_Prehistoric Europe_ should be damned.” M. Falsan also asked permission\r\nto translate _The Great Ice Age_ into French, and there were German\r\noffers to translate both _The Great Ice Age_ and _Prehistoric Europe_.\r\n\r\nThe latter appeared towards the end of November. Copies were sent,\r\namong others, to Charles Darwin and to Prof. Ramsay, whose letters in\r\nreply were a source of great gratification to James Geikie. Darwin\r\nwrote both immediately upon receipt, and later after he had read the\r\nbook. In the second letter he says:--“Yours is a grand book, and I\r\nthank you heartily for the instruction and pleasure it has given me.”\r\nThat this was not mere flattery is apparent from the keen discussion of\r\ncertain special points in which he was interested.\r\n\r\nThe next year, 1881, was one of great stress, though the tale of its\r\nexternal events is soon told. That Prof. Ramsay’s health was failing\r\nhad long been known, and though his actual resignation did not take\r\nplace till the end of 1881, the fact that it was impending was obvious\r\nlong before. It was also known among the Survey men that his retiral\r\nwould mean extensive changes, likely to affect directly and indirectly\r\nmost of the members of the staff. As has been already stated, it led\r\nto James Geikie’s resignation and his acceptance of the professorship\r\nat Edinburgh University. Something must therefore be said in regard to\r\nthe reasons that induced him to leave highly congenial work for a post\r\nwhich was not, certainly at first, wholly so, and which further, at\r\nleast in early days, did not materially improve his financial position.\r\n\r\nIt must be noted first that by this time he was the author of two bulky\r\nbooks (produced, as we have seen, at the cost of great and continuous\r\ntoil) which had been hailed at home and abroad as “epoch-making.” He\r\nhad correspondents in most parts of the civilised world; men of mark\r\nin their own countries had publicly acknowledged him as a leader of\r\ngeological thought, a fount of inspiration, an opener up of new paths\r\nof research. At the same time, to those immediately above him he was a\r\nsubordinate, with a very moderate salary, a recipient of orders, with\r\nlittle opportunity for initiating changes or improvements, and was\r\nliving in a small provincial town, to some extent remote from the main\r\ncurrent of public life.\r\n\r\nSecond, and this is a point which is much less familiar to the general\r\npublic than in a democratic country it ought to be, his books were\r\nnot of the kind which bring direct monetary reward to their author.\r\nHis family was increasing, for his third son was born in this year of\r\n1881; he himself was past forty, and the probability that he could\r\ncontinue to go on working for many years more at the rate at which he\r\nhad been toiling during the last twenty was necessarily diminishing.\r\nNow it is universally admitted, as a general proposition, that when a\r\nman without private means has done and is doing important and highly\r\nspecialised work for his country and for the world, work which does\r\nnot bring direct pecuniary gain, then it is the duty of those in high\r\nplaces to see that he be established in such a position as to free\r\nhim from financial anxiety for the future, to enable him to face his\r\nresponsibilities with a calm mind, to obviate the necessity for his\r\nwasting his strength and intellect in hack-work in order to supplement\r\nhis income. But, while this is admitted as a general proposition, there\r\nis always the possibility that petty personal interests will intervene\r\nin a particular case. James Geikie left the Survey partly under the\r\npressure of such interests, which seemed to threaten his prospects of\r\nimmediate promotion, and partly under that of friends who thought that\r\nthe professorship offered more scope for him. Whether he was right or\r\nwrong it is difficult to say, but there is evidence that at least at\r\nfirst he regretted his decision. He might have quitted the Survey of\r\nhis own free will, and would certainly have done this with a pang, but\r\nthe thought that his decision to leave was not wholly voluntary, made\r\nthe pang excessively bitter.\r\n\r\nMany of the letters of this year of anxiety are too intimate to\r\nbe quoted. We shall only insert sentences and phrases to make the\r\nnarrative plain.\r\n\r\nOne of the first indications of coming events was an attack upon\r\n_Prehistoric Europe_ in the early part of 1881, an attack which it\r\nseems quite clear was not motived wholly by an honest desire to promote\r\nthe cause of science. It was this element which made the matter so hard\r\nto bear.\r\n\r\n\r\n The affair has affected me more than I can tell.... You will laugh,\r\n but it is true all the same, that I can hardly eat or sleep. For the\r\n attack itself I don’t mind, I know that my book is a bit of honest\r\n true work, and will outlive the attempts ... to stifle it.... I wish\r\n the snow would go and let me out to have a walk. Sometimes I wish that\r\n I had kept clear of writing books altogether.... I remember wondering\r\n once when Green told me that when he was vexed with anything a romp\r\n with his bairns made him quite hearty. It seemed to me overstrained.\r\n I don’t think so now that I have bairns of my own. Their quaint and\r\n funny ways quite carry you out of yourself.... Dearly as I love life,\r\n I can already foresee that the time will come when I shall be glad\r\n to lie down and sleep the sleep that knows no waking.... Verily I\r\n do believe a good wife and loving mother is the only treasure of\r\n treasures that is worth striving for in this world!... How much you\r\n and I have to be thankful for!\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are a few extracts written to his friend Mr Horne at the moment\r\nwhen the history of the incident was just becoming plain, and at a time\r\nalso when Mr Horne’s first child had just been born; they throw perhaps\r\nmore light upon it and upon the character of James Geikie than any\r\nordered narrative could do.\r\n\r\nLater letters of the same spring emphasise the effect which the\r\nincident had upon him. “The whole thing,” he writes in one letter,\r\n“has worried me more than I can tell;” but a journey south, where,\r\n_inter alia_, he lectured at Hull, and led a big geological excursion,\r\nhelped to change the current of his thoughts, while his reception at\r\nHull gratified him greatly. Fresh letters from continental geologists\r\nalso, not only praising his book but discussing the bearing of his\r\nresults upon their observations in various parts of Europe, must have\r\nhelped to assure him that it was worth while to do honest work, despite\r\ndetractors. Further, the family moved from Perth to Birnam, where they\r\ntook a charming cottage at the foot of Birnam Hill, covered with roses,\r\nand with a large untidy garden. The early summer was brilliantly fine,\r\nand the fresh air and open life of the country must have made it easier\r\nto take a more philosophical view of the affair, unpleasant as it was.\r\n\r\nThe letters of early summer show at least a perceptible recovery\r\nof balance and cheerfulness. His third son was born in June, and\r\nin answer to congratulations he says:--“A _third_ boy was a great\r\ndisappointment--a girl would have ‘completed’ all the family any\r\nreasonable man could desire!”\r\n\r\nThe arrival of the baby prevented him from accompanying Dr Helland on\r\na projected trip to Iceland in early summer, but, rather curiously, an\r\nopportunity to visit the island occurred a little later in the same\r\nyear, for he went to report on some sulphur mines.\r\n\r\nOn 17th September he writes to Mr Horne:--“I have just returned from\r\nIceland, where I have had some very hard but very interesting work.\r\nWhat a country! Fancy me riding eleven hours over lava-beds, mountains,\r\netc., devil a road or even path! However, all was fresh and new.”\r\n\r\nBy this time the question of changes in the Survey was becoming acute,\r\nand James Geikie was beginning to debate with himself as to whether he\r\nought to try for the Chair in Geology at Edinburgh for his children’s\r\nsake. The indecision he found very unsettling. “I can settle to\r\nnothing--reading and writing are alike out of the question.” More than\r\na month later he writes:--“I am pulled two ways--my own desire and wish\r\nis to remain in the Survey.” “My repugnance to that Chair,” he says a\r\nfew days later, “increases as the days go past.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps nothing, however, shows better his fundamental repugnance to\r\nall the weighing of questions of worldly advantage, to the scheming\r\nand plotting and wire-pulling which go to the making of appointments,\r\nthan a letter written to Mr Horne in the thick of the conflict. This\r\nbegins with an account of information which had reached him in regard\r\nto the position of affairs as to the Edinburgh Chair, and glides off\r\ninsensibly into an account of letters just received from Prof. Penck\r\nand Prof. Gandry, the one a German and the other a French geologist.\r\nBoth letters contained much of great interest to him, and the letter\r\nbecomes a full discussion of the points raised, the question of his own\r\nfuture meantime sinking entirely out of mind.\r\n\r\nObviously he wanted to be let alone and allowed to do his work in\r\npeace, to have reasonable security for his children. In one letter he\r\nlaments his own lack of worldly wisdom, and his willingness to take\r\nadvice from his various friends; and the rather pathetic balancing of\r\nthe advantages of one apparently possible position against another,\r\nmerely meant that his mind was set on other things altogether, and\r\nthat in consequence he allowed himself to be swayed by the different\r\ninfluences brought to bear upon him. His own candour and frankness made\r\nhim singularly willing to accept advice offered under the guise of\r\nfriendship, without stopping to investigate the question whether his\r\nadvisers were or were not wholly disinterested. But his unwillingness\r\nto be separated from his old colleagues remains the dominant note, even\r\nwhen he yielded to what seemed sound arguments brought to bear upon\r\nhim. His instant response to kindliness is shown by the following\r\nquotation:--“Isn’t old Ramsay a trump. He wrote me a short, but such\r\nan affectionate letter that I declare I could not read it without wet\r\neyes.”\r\n\r\nHis final decision to apply for the Chair was due to the receipt of a\r\nprivate letter which informed him that the Home Office was prepared to\r\nappoint him immediately on his sending in an application, on the ground\r\nthat he was the man obviously best fitted for the post. It was also\r\nindicated to him informally that the reputation which he had obtained\r\nowing to his books was such that any other testimonial was unnecessary.\r\nInquiries had been made which had satisfied the Home Office that no\r\nother possible candidate had such high qualifications for the post. In\r\nannouncing to his friend Mr Horne the receipt of this flattering though\r\nunofficial letter, James Geikie cannot forbear adding:--“I shall quit\r\nthe Survey dead against my desires. But yet I feel I am doing best for\r\nmyself and for my children.”\r\n\r\nBoth his natural modesty, and perhaps the painful memory of his\r\ncontroversy in the spring, made him uneasy about the fact that the\r\nappointment was made without, as he says, any chance being given\r\nto other possible candidates. Thus he forwarded the unasked-for\r\ntestimonials, the writers including all the leading men of the day in\r\nhis own branch of science. But amidst all the bustle of arranging about\r\nthe testimonials, and about the leaving of his work and the finding\r\nof a house in Edinburgh, the note of regret recurs constantly. “I\r\ncan’t realise that I am leaving the Survey. How vexed I am--no one can\r\ntell.”\r\n\r\nNot all his own regrets, however, could quench his enthusiasm for the\r\nservice he was giving up. Thus he took up cudgels with the utmost\r\nvigour for his friends on the Survey, whose interests he thought likely\r\nto be affected by certain proposed changes. These changes he thought\r\nregrettable not only on this account, but also because they seemed to\r\nhim contrary to the interests of the whole Survey.\r\n\r\nHis new work at Edinburgh was not to begin till the autumn of 1882, and\r\nthough the house in Edinburgh was taken in spring, the family stayed on\r\nin the country all summer, partly to let the new-made professor finish\r\noff his Survey work, and partly that all might enjoy the country air.\r\nBut the respite did not ease the pain of the prospective parting:--“It\r\nmakes me sad at heart when I think that the old Survey days are for\r\nme so soon to end. So life wags--some day soon I shall be ending work\r\nfor good and all, and then for a long rest, and no heartaches and no\r\nheadaches. My heart gets heavy whiles at the thought of leaving the\r\ngreen fields over which I have wandered so long and happily. After\r\nforty years of life it is almost too late to change. But what I have\r\ndone I hope will turn out for the best. Anyhow, I hope you fellows will\r\nnot forget the old comradeship, but come often and see me. I can’t yet\r\nrealise that I am leaving work in the field, and going into town to\r\nbecome fat, greasy, and respectable.” And so the summer months slipped\r\naway, and autumn brought Edinburgh and the new sphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nEDINBURGH AND THE PROFESSORSHIP\r\n\r\n1882-1888\r\n\r\n\r\nOfficial work in Edinburgh began with the delivery by the new professor\r\nof his inaugural address on 27th October 1882, the subject being “The\r\nAims and Methods of Geological Inquiry.”\r\n\r\nIn early days the class was small, and as the income derived from\r\nSir Roderick Murchison’s endowment was supplemented by the students’\r\nfees, then paid direct to the professor, their number was an important\r\nmatter. Further, at the time of the appointment, as for many years\r\nlater, geology was not compulsory for any degree, and was not even\r\nan optional degree for the ordinary course in Arts. This meant that\r\nthe professor had not a status in the University comparable to that\r\nof those of the Arts professors whose courses were compulsory, or of\r\nthe members of the Medical Faculty. On the other hand, it meant that\r\nthe students who took the class did so from a genuine interest in the\r\nsubject. The fact that Prof. Geikie soon acquired much weight in the\r\nSenate was due entirely to his strong personality, unassisted, at\r\nleast at first, by any advantages of position.\r\n\r\nThe letters of this first winter session are filled, as might be\r\nexpected, with the business of settling down in Edinburgh, the buying\r\nof furniture and carpets, the “grind” of getting up the lectures, and\r\nrecurring regrets at parting with old friends. A letter to Mr Horne,\r\nwritten at the beginning of January 1883, illustrates very clearly\r\nthe dawning of genuine interest in the new work, still mingled with\r\nlongings for the old. The following passages may be quoted:--\r\n\r\n\r\n I was at the office the other day.... But how the days flash by.\r\n And how the dear old days are gone when you and I and the others\r\n used to chaff and make a noise o’ winter in that office. It makes\r\n me melancholy sometimes when I think of it all. I am Professor in\r\n Edinburgh University, but my heart is in the Survey with my old\r\n Survey chums. Here are tall hats, black coats, pompous windbags--and\r\n in a word, starch and humbug. My boy, I have been caught too old.\r\n Had I come here earlier I might have become “respectable” too--but\r\n it is too late! However, I get on well with my students who, being\r\n young, understand fun and such improvised nonsense as I endeavour\r\n to cheer them with. I fancy some of my colleagues would have their\r\n hair elevated if they heard me. I like the work much better than I\r\n expected, but eh man! I miss the freedom of the country.\r\n\r\nThe office alluded to above was, of course, the Survey Office, and\r\nProf. Geikie’s colleagues record that at first he found it difficult\r\nto keep away from it. He generally dropped in on his way to or from\r\nthe University to see how things were getting on, and never missed an\r\nopportunity of meeting his old friends. When he began to have students’\r\nparties some of the Survey men were generally asked also, so that the\r\nstudents might have an opportunity of coming into direct contact with\r\nthe men who were making geology in Scotland.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany allusions in the early letters show that the new professor found\r\nthe task of arranging his class work irksome. In certain branches\r\nof geology he had himself taken little interest, having specialised\r\nearly, and as at first he had no assistant, all the work fell on his\r\nown shoulders. For microscopic work and some aspects of mineralogy he\r\nhad always expressed contempt, as being only suitable for the men who\r\ncould not or did not work in the field; and these despised subjects\r\nhe now felt himself constrained to “get up” for class purposes, and\r\nthis necessity drew from him many groans. One must admit that there\r\nwas a certain tragedy in this taking of a man of forty-four off his\r\nown highly specialised work to grind up a subject of practically no\r\nuse to him in that work; but such tragedies are frequent when original\r\nthinkers are placed in professorial chairs which demand much elementary\r\nteaching. Preparing for his microscopic class, he complains, means\r\nsitting up half the night, and is “fiddling work,” requiring little in\r\nthe way of brains.\r\n\r\nA letter to Prof. Stevenson of New York, dated 26th January 1883, is\r\nnot without interest in the same connection, in showing the effect of\r\nthis drudgery on his own work. In acknowledging one of the former’s\r\npublications, he says:--“I am sorry I have no papers to send you. My\r\npreparations for a new start as professor in our University here\r\nhave absorbed nearly all my leisure time, so that several papers I\r\nhad chalked out have been laid aside for the present.” A letter to Mr\r\nHorne, written a few weeks later, while the author was invigilating\r\na class examination, shows where his thoughts turned as soon as the\r\nstrain was lifted for a moment. It records the receipt of a letter from\r\nProf. Nathorst of Stockholm, who had been doing work in Spitsbergen,\r\nand had come independently to the same conclusion in regard to certain\r\npoints as James Geikie. The latter adds:--“He says he is delighted\r\nthat his conclusions, arrived at independently, should corroborate and\r\nsupport mine. Very nice.”\r\n\r\nThe same letter to Mr Horne contains an allusion to an odd form of\r\ncompliment which had just reached the writer. A lady in Nova Scotia,\r\napparently a total stranger, had written to ask if the author of _The\r\nGreat Ice Age_ would stand godfather to her baby. The cream of the jest\r\nwas, however, that the said baby was not expected to enter this vale\r\nof tears till some three or four months after the date of the letter.\r\nHistory, unfortunately, does not record whether or not the infant\r\nput in an appearance, nor whether it had to be baptised as James or\r\nJamesina, but the professor gave his consent without, as he says, any\r\nungentlemanly reference to common proverbs.\r\n\r\nAt the close of this, his first winter session, the new professor\r\ntook a party of students on a long geological excursion to the Border\r\ndistrict, his old hunting-ground. During the course of the excursion,\r\nwhich lasted several days, the party visited Buchtrig, whether wholly\r\nfrom geological or partly from sentimental reasons does not appear.\r\nSome fine tramps were taken over the hills, and the fact that the\r\nleader had himself worked out the geology of the district must have\r\nadded much zest to the excursion.\r\n\r\nIn May the first summer class in geology was held, this being one of\r\nProf. James Geikie’s innovations. It was well attended, twenty-six\r\nstudents taking part, and consisted of both indoor work and excursions.\r\nAfter this year this summer course became a part of the regular\r\nroutine, and while it was a great improvement from the point of view of\r\nteaching, it naturally still further diminished the professor’s spare\r\ntime, and placed him at a disadvantage, so far as independent work was\r\nconcerned, with his colleagues of the Arts Faculty who then had only a\r\nshort winter session.\r\n\r\nThe summer holiday was spent at Largo in Fife, and the summer was\r\nclouded by the death of Prof. Geikie’s father, who passed away at the\r\nage of seventy-three, having seen both his geologist sons established\r\nin positions of importance.\r\n\r\nThe work of the following session, 1883-1884, proved easier than the\r\nfirst, “but just yet the Chair is not a ‘bed of roses.’ It takes up\r\nmore time than I had reckoned for.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [_From an etching by Mr William Hole, A.R.S.A._\r\n\r\nA STUDY OF PROF. GEIKIE IN 1884.]\r\n\r\nSpring brought two distractions, the Tercentenary celebrations of\r\nEdinburgh University, and preparations for a visit to Canada and the\r\nUnited States in connection with the British Association meeting\r\nat Montreal. Of the former Prof. Geikie soon wearied, and voiced\r\nhis weariness, and perhaps some remains of resentment in regard to\r\nthose winter nights spent--fruitlessly from his point of view--in\r\n“getting-up” uncongenial subjects, in a series of verses. These at the\r\ntime were shown only to privileged friends, but may be quoted here now\r\nfor the sake of those who can see a joke, even if it is partly at their\r\nown expense. They make it clear that the author was not yet wholly\r\nreconciled to academic life.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MY ALMA MATER ON THE COMPLETION OF HER 300TH YEAR\r\n\r\n    1.\r\n\r\n    Hail stately pile! hail treasure-house of lore!\r\n    Dear nurse of many a wit and many a bore!\r\n    What mingled thoughts have we in this late time,\r\n    Reviewing all the glories of thy prime!\r\n\r\n    2.\r\n\r\n    Three hundred years ago thou hadst thy birth,\r\n    And now thy name is known o’er all the earth:\r\n    In making ropes of sand once great thy skill--\r\n    Thy fame is now the scalpel and the pill.\r\n\r\n    3.\r\n\r\n    O Alma Mater, ’neath thy learned shade,\r\n    How many a plot against mankind is laid!\r\n    And ghouls in hundreds every year stalk forth,\r\n    To testify to all what thou art worth!\r\n\r\n    4.\r\n\r\n    Tramp! tramp! they come, the ministers of death,\r\n    At their approach the boldest holds his breath:\r\n    “Your money and your life!” they gleeful cry--\r\n    And awestruck patients pay their fees and die.\r\n\r\n    5.\r\n\r\n    These ghouls thy children are: nor these alone,\r\n    O bounteous mother, hail thee as their own!\r\n    Nursed in thine arms, the vacant--void no more--\r\n    In countless numbers issue from thy door!\r\n\r\n    6.\r\n\r\n    Confusion tightly pack’d within each brain--\r\n    Or air, compress’d, distending the inane,\r\n    Thine is the gas they own, and thine the lead,\r\n    The tongue untiring, and the addled head.\r\n\r\n    7.\r\n\r\n    To pulpit and to platform see them fly,\r\n    For, wind-distracted, they must speak or die;\r\n    Bored and perplex’d the audience shifts about,\r\n    Those only happy who can snooze it out.\r\n\r\n          .      .      .      .      .\r\n\r\n    11.\r\n\r\n    But I, unlucky, whither shall I go,\r\n    Who of this lore of thine so little know!\r\n    What academic prize to me shall fall,\r\n    Content to know a little, and not all!\r\n\r\n    12.\r\n\r\n    Forgive me, O my mother, if I still\r\n    Keep some brain-space for after years to fill!\r\n    Nor chide if I decline this awful cram\r\n    Of unassorted victuals for exam!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe spring brought also the offer of the honorary fellowship of the\r\nGeological Society of Stockholm.\r\n\r\nIn August he started for New York, this being his first journey across\r\nthe Atlantic. He enjoyed the voyage very much, being one of the very\r\nfew passengers who were able to appear at meals during a stormy period\r\nmet with soon after leaving Ireland. Later the weather improved and\r\nthe party became very lively, Prof. Geikie participating in all the\r\nentertainments and gaiety which went on. “I feel already 20 per cent.\r\nbetter in mind and body,” he says; “twenty years younger am I too, or\r\nI would not enjoy such high jinks as go on here.” Several friends were\r\nmade on the ship, and one of these, a Boston gentleman, showed much\r\nkindness to Prof. Geikie on his arrival in New York. Thanks to him, it\r\nwas possible to see something of the city during a brief stay there,\r\nthe incidents including a visit behind the scenes of a theatre, where\r\nthe stage manager announced that he had read _The Great Ice Age_.\r\n\r\nFrom New York the journey was continued to Chicago, which did not make\r\na very favourable impression, and on to St Paul, much of geological\r\ninterest being seen _en route_. From St Paul the party went to\r\nWinnipeg, the furthest point west reached. The crossing of the prairies\r\nmade a great impression on Prof. Geikie. He says:--\r\n\r\n\r\n I have often pictured the prairies to myself, but somehow the picture\r\n never comes up to the reality. How strange it is to gaze over a\r\n seemingly limitless extent of grass-land as flat as any Scottish\r\n haugh-land. The sky was exquisitely bright--white clouds sailing over\r\n a delicate blue--but the colours of the prairie surpass my powers\r\n of description. The wild flowers fairly took my breath away--there\r\n were blues, purples, whites, and yellows, the latter predominating.\r\n Standing outside of the car one never tired watching the changing\r\n hues--here were broad belts of yellow, there patches of blue and\r\n white and purple. Or all the colours were commingled in a dazzling\r\n confusion. The rails are laid flat on the prairie and the sweet\r\n flowers grow up to the rails. Butterflies in absolute clouds--great\r\n big fellows--danced and flitted about, and now and again a flight\r\n of birds appeared. But huts or houses were seen only at very wide\r\n intervals--sometimes many miles were passed without any sign of human\r\n habitation. I enjoyed the ride of 500 miles through the prairies much\r\n more than anything else I have yet seen. It was a new experience.\r\n What an expressive silence seemed to overhang the vast stretch of\r\n grass-land. A heavy storm of rain and sheet lightning suddenly came\r\n on and drove us into the car at sunset. When I woke this morning at\r\n four o’clock and looked out of the carriage window I saw an exquisite\r\n sunrise--a beautiful pink flushed all the east, and the prairie fairly\r\n gleamed with golden yellow and blue.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [_Photo by Gutebrunst, Philadelphia._\r\n\r\nPROF. GEIKIE IN 1888.]\r\n\r\nThe notes on Winnipeg and on the journey thence to Toronto are\r\ninteresting as showing how little future developments were expected at\r\nthis date. Of Winnipeg, described as being “in the far west,” Prof.\r\nGeikie says:--“Winnipeg is a surprising place for so far distant a\r\nregion. Here are some 25,000 inhabitants: it is quite a considerable\r\ntown--with churches, theatres, etc., etc., and a Scientific Society.”\r\nSpeaking of his journey eastwards he says:--\r\n\r\n\r\n We left Winnipeg on Wednesday (20th) and travelled all day\r\n through rough rolling ground, very rocky and sprinkled with my\r\n friends--boulder-clay, morainic gravel and sand, and large erratics.\r\n The country was upon the whole rather dreary, dense thickets of spruce\r\n fir covering the rocky knolls, and swamps and morasses lying in the\r\n hollows. Here and there where the ground was more open the prairie\r\n flowers flourished, and butterflies and dragon-flies fluttered and\r\n darted about in the sunshine. Night overtook us while we were still in\r\n the same monotonous country. A number of British Ass. folk had joined\r\n us at Winnipeg, among them Prof. Ramsay,[4] a nephew of _my_ Prof. R.\r\n The night we passed in the sleeping-car, and next morning found us\r\n still sweeping along through the same kind of forest land. Very fine\r\n evidence of ice-work was seen all the way--just like what I know in\r\n Wester Ross and Sutherland. We breakfasted at a rough station in those\r\n dreary backwoods. Houses are few and far apart in such a desolate\r\n region, and I can’t see how the railway can ever pay. We passed over\r\n 1000 miles of land, most of which seemed to me as barren and hopeless\r\n as the poorest tracts of the Outer Hebrides. The trees are small\r\n miserable sticks, and everywhere one sees rising above these small\r\n trees tall ragged and naked trunks, marked with fire, showing that\r\n much forest land must have been destroyed by fire in earlier days. We\r\n stopped at last at Port Arthur, at the upper end of Lake Superior,\r\n where we spent the day and night. This is a small backwoods town of\r\n some 2000 or 3000 inhabitants. The view over Thunder Bay is fine, and\r\n I enjoyed a walk into the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [4] Later Sir William Ramsay.\r\n\r\nNext day the party sailed down the lakes to Owen Sound and took train\r\nfor Toronto. From here Niagara was visited, and after that the journey\r\ncontinued to Montreal.\r\n\r\nFrom Montreal Prof. Geikie went south to Philadelphia, where he found\r\nthe heat very trying, and then back to New York and on to Boston. The\r\nlatter town attracted him greatly. “I feel more at home in Boston than\r\nI have felt since leaving Auld Reekie. The people are more like our own\r\npeople too.” Here he met and made many friends, and tells an amusing\r\nexperience with a German lady doctor, who made wine from grapes grown\r\nin her own vineries. She and Prof. Geikie got on very well together,\r\nand the latter was invited to visit the vineries and taste the wine.\r\nHaving received a private warning, the professor resolved to display\r\nextreme abstemiousness when confronted with the fluid, but the lady\r\nceremoniously proposed the health of her guest from across the seas,\r\nwho felt constrained to return the compliment with a brimming goblet.\r\nFortunately the proceedings came to a close soon afterwards, and Prof.\r\nGeikie and his friend were able to hurry home to the latter’s house in\r\norder to correct the influence of the concoction with a modest “dram.”\r\nThey took a long drive afterwards, and no results followed, apparently,\r\nbeyond the acquisition of a conviction that the climate of Boston was\r\nunsuited to the juice of the grape.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards Prof. Geikie returned home, and in December he\r\nwrites to Mr Horne bemoaning the amount of work which he found waiting\r\nfor him. He says:--“But know one thing, O Horne, that here in Auld\r\nReekie I am pestered to death with correspondence. People scribble on\r\nall sorts of subjects, and expect answers, and I begin to hate the\r\nsight of notepaper. And so the letters that I ought to write and like\r\nto write remain unwritten, while those I detest to write take up more\r\ntime than I like to waste. You should have seen the piles waiting for\r\nme on my return from Yankee land--some of the rubbish is not answered\r\nyet.” He goes on in the same letter to say:--“I find living in town\r\nmore expensive than the country, there are so many calls upon one, and\r\nthe class does not pay as well as I had hoped. But that is mending\r\nand I have good hopes.” He also speaks of a “pot-boiler” he was busy\r\nwith, to wit, his _Outlines of Geology_, which though far advanced at\r\nthis time did not appear till more than a year afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe same note occurs in other letters of the following year, and a\r\nprojected visit to the Hebrides in the summer of 1885 had to be given\r\nup owing to “circumstances over which I have no control (_i.e._, empty\r\npurse).” “Living here is not so easy as in the country,” he adds again.\r\nBut he also says:--“I have got into the ways of my new sphere and jog\r\nalong very comfortably.”\r\n\r\nMore interesting than the “pot-boiling” of which he speaks frequently,\r\nwas his work in connection with the Scottish Geographical Society,\r\nin which he took an active part in the autumn of 1884. Thus in the\r\nletter already quoted he says:--“I have been sair taigled with that\r\nGeographical Society, but I think it will do; and I mean to work it\r\nto some purpose. We are going to bring out the first number of a\r\nGeographical Magazine in January, for which I have promised to write a\r\nshort article on the Physical Features of Scotland.”\r\n\r\nAt the first meeting of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society,\r\nit may be noted, which was held on 28th October 1884, Prof. Geikie\r\nmoved--“That this meeting, recognising the scientific and general\r\nutility of a national society for the promotion of geography,\r\nresolves that a Geographical Society for Scotland be now formed.”\r\nHe was associated with the Society till his death, and took a very\r\nactive part in its management, as Hon. Editor from 1888 onward, as a\r\nVice-President, and for the period 1904-1910 as President. Beginning\r\nwith the first number also he made frequent contributions to the\r\n_Scottish Geographical Magazine_, contributions of great scientific\r\nimportance, and in addition was always ready to put his knowledge and\r\nexperience at the disposal of the Acting Editor. During a long period\r\nof years his work for the Society must have made large inroads upon his\r\ntime and energy, and thus geography in Scotland, no less than geology,\r\nowes him a great debt of gratitude.\r\n\r\nNo very noteworthy events took place in the year 1885. The _Outlines\r\nof Geology_ was finished, though it did not appear till after the New\r\nYear, and in autumn a visit was paid to Louisa, Lady Ashburton, who\r\nbecame a great friend of the family. The visit was to Lady Ashburton’s\r\ncountry house at Loch Luichart in Ross, and was very enjoyable, many\r\ndrives being taken to surrounding places. On the homeward journey Prof.\r\nand Mrs Geikie stayed with their friends Mr and Mrs Horne at Inverness.\r\n\r\nThe party at Loch Luichart was evidently a very gay one, and Prof.\r\nGeikie, freed from strain and at leisure, seems to have been full of\r\nlife. Letters from members of the party, written on receipt of Heine’s\r\n_Songs and Lyrics_, which saw the light in the autumn of 1887, are full\r\nof allusions to the visit and to the songs that had been sung during\r\nthe drives, allusions which cast a pleasant light on the geologist’s\r\nhuman side.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of 1886 the _Outlines of Geology_ appeared, and was\r\nso successful that a second edition was called for less than two years\r\nafterwards. During 1886 also Prof. Geikie’s fourth son was born.\r\n\r\nAs the year went on, signs of strain due to the process of adjustment\r\nto the conditions of town life began to make themselves apparent, one\r\nof the most distressing symptoms being insomnia. A sleeping-draught\r\nwhich gave five or six hours of sleep was welcomed with a fervour which\r\ntells a pitiful tale. Perhaps in some ways even more serious for one\r\nwho was lecturing daily was loss of voice, which occurred at Christmas.\r\nThe brief vacation failed to produce permanent improvement, and the\r\nearly part of the year 1887 saw a losing struggle between ill-health\r\nand James Geikie’s strong sense of duty. As soon as the spring vacation\r\nfreed him he went off to the Canary Islands to recuperate. A letter\r\nfrom Teneriffe, dated 18th April 1887, indicates a characteristically\r\nrapid rebound of spirits:--“This place is a paradise on earth!” The\r\nhotel (at Orotava) he describes as “simply fairy-like. It is bowered\r\nin trees, palms and others. Fountains and lakes are all round, lovely\r\ngardens one blaze of gorgeous colour, and rich green, cool colonnades\r\nwith lounges where you can sit and dream and gaze on the sunlit sea.\r\nThe mornings and evenings are simply heavenly.”\r\n\r\nDuring his stay Prof. Geikie climbed the Peak on foot, an exhausting\r\nexcursion in the heat, and one for which he was probably not fit.\r\nHis account of the effect of rising above the mountains noontide\r\ncloud-cap is interesting:--“When we got above the clouds the sight\r\nwas very grand. The upper surface is approximately level, and, rising\r\nabove it, the higher ridges and mountains look so many islands in a\r\ntumbled and rolling sea. But such a sea! Imagine the sun blazing down\r\nfrom a perfectly clear and cloudless sky--the mountain tops rugged\r\nand serrated, and coloured red and yellow--and the cloud-sea shining\r\nwith the most silvery brilliance. Now and again the wind would cause\r\nthe clouds to rise up like billows and roll for some little distance\r\nup the hill-slopes above the general level of the cloud-sea, but the\r\ninvading billows were soon torn to shreds and disappeared.” Of the\r\ntop he says:--“What a weird scene it was. Here were numerous extinct\r\nvolcanoes, craters looking raw and red just as if they had vomited\r\nforth yesterday. The ground was sprinkled all round with slags and\r\ncinders and volcanic sand and dust, and not a blade of grass was to be\r\nseen.”\r\n\r\nProf. Geikie did a certain amount of geologising during his stay in the\r\nCanaries, and said in his letters home that he was greatly the better\r\nfor his trip:--“My voice is as strong as ever, and I feel braced up in\r\nevery way.” Unfortunately the improvement did not last after his return\r\nhome. He had a disappointing summer, and with winter the insomnia\r\nreturned. He could do little save his class work, and this was a sore\r\nstruggle. But the fact of his being cut off from his own special work\r\nhad the effect of turning his attention again to the German poems, and\r\nthe book, as stated, finally appeared in the autumn of 1887. A good\r\nmany of the letters acknowledging receipt have been preserved, for the\r\npoems had always been very dear to him. A pathetic letter from Lady\r\nRamsay records the pleasure which the book gave to Sir Andrew Ramsay,\r\nnow an invalid and sadly changed from what he had been in his prime.\r\nShe had read some of the verses to him as he sat in his bath-chair at\r\nBeaumaris, where the family were now living, and they had brought back\r\nsome flashes of his old animation.\r\n\r\nProf. Geikie’s health continued to give cause for anxiety throughout\r\nthe winter of 1887-1888, and in summer he and Mrs Geikie went to the\r\nEngadine, in the hope that the high altitude and bracing air would\r\ndo him good. As the weather became colder they went down into Italy,\r\ncoming home eventually by sea from Naples. Some charming letters to the\r\nboys, who were left at home, and to others of the family connection,\r\nhave been preserved, but deal for the most part only with the usual\r\nincidents of travel in the Alps. “The boys” were by this time old\r\nenough to be keenly interested in butterflies, and their father\r\ngives some humorous descriptions of his attempts to increase their\r\ncollections.\r\n\r\nAmong the minor incidents of the tour were a meeting with Huxley at\r\nthe Maloja, and the delivery by Prof. Geikie of a lecture on the Ice\r\nAge at Pontresina to an audience of two to three hundred people. The\r\nlatter part of the visit to the Engadine was marred by the cold, and\r\nthe altitude did not seem to suit him so well as he had hoped. On the\r\njourney through Italy a stop was made on Lake Como, of which Prof.\r\nGeikie speaks with the same enthusiasm as of old. On the whole, the\r\ntour seems to have been very beneficial, and to have been an important\r\nfactor in restoring him to health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nFINAL EDITION OF “THE GREAT ICE AGE”\r\n\r\n1889-1903\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 1889 Prof. Geikie was awarded the Murchison\r\nmedal of the Geological Society of London, “in acknowledgment of his\r\nimportant contributions to the geology of North Britain, and especially\r\nof his investigation of glacial phenomena.” A letter of cordial\r\ncongratulation from his old friend Mr Whitaker on the award speaks of\r\nthe writer’s own debt to the author, and of his adoption of a number\r\nof the latter’s conclusions. In this year also he was made a D.C.L. of\r\nDurham University.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [_Photo by Elliott & Fry._\r\n\r\nPROF. GEIKIE AT THE AGE OF SIXTY.]\r\n\r\nAt this time Prof. Geikie had added to his university work proper a\r\ncourse for women, who were as yet excluded from classes within the\r\nbuilding. At the end of the course, in the spring of 1890, he took the\r\nmembers of the class on a long excursion to Birnam, to give them an\r\ninsight into field geology. The party was a gay one, and their doings\r\nwere celebrated by the leader in a series of verses, of which the\r\nfirst runs as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Of the Geologic Class\r\n      Sing the glorious days’ renown\r\n    When to Birnam it did pass\r\n      From the tumults of the town--\r\n    A score of earnest students in their frocks,\r\n      Behold the learned band,\r\n      Each with hammer in her hand\r\n      Prepared to pound to sand\r\n            All the rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\nProf. Geikie’s muse was also active the same summer at the dinner of\r\nthe Edinburgh Royal Society Club, held in honour of Dr Nansen’s return\r\nfrom Greenland, where he sang a song of his own composition which met\r\nwith a great reception. Its _motif_ was the joys of Greenland as a\r\nplace remote from civilisation, and a lament over the fact that, except\r\nfor that happy land, “the hale round world is tounifeed.”\r\n\r\nIn this year also he was President of the Geological Section at the\r\nNewcastle-on-Tyne meeting of the British Association, and devoted his\r\npresidential address to the subject of “Glacial Geology.”\r\n\r\nIn 1891 he returned to America, this time to deliver a course\r\nof lectures at the Lowell Institute in Boston. This gave him an\r\nopportunity to renew many pleasant friendships made during his previous\r\nvisit, but his stay was somewhat marred by an attack of influenza.\r\nAmong his papers are many notes of invitation and greeting, an\r\ninteresting one being from Prof. William James, which contains careful\r\ninstructions as to how the host’s house might be found, accompanied by\r\na sketch-map.\r\n\r\nThe following year saw the publication of an important paper “On the\r\nGlacial Succession in Europe,” in regard to which the author says,\r\nin a letter to his friend Prof. Stevenson of New York:--“I sincerely\r\nbelieve that the conclusions will stand, no matter how extravagant they\r\nmay now appear to be.” This year also he was President of Section E\r\n(Geography) at the Edinburgh meeting of the British Association, the\r\nsubject of his presidential address being the “Geographical Development\r\nof Coast-lines.” Among the foreign guests at this meeting was the\r\nNorwegian botanist, Prof. Blytt, who writes to thank him “most heartily\r\nfor all your great kindness to me during my stay in your beautiful\r\ncity.”\r\n\r\nBy this time Prof. Geikie’s university work had considerably increased,\r\nfor in 1891 he had been elected Convener of the Science Degrees\r\nCommittee, and, after a Faculty of Science had been instituted by\r\nthe Royal Universities Commission in 1894, he was elected Dean of\r\nthe Faculty, a post which he held till a year before his retirement\r\nfrom the professorship. This brought him into contact with all the\r\nscience students, and gave him much to do in the way of organising and\r\narranging courses. As a result his feeling of strangeness to university\r\nlife seems to have passed away entirely, and he became thoroughly\r\nabsorbed in the life of the institution. The work of the Universities\r\nCommission also greatly improved the status of his subject, and his\r\nposition as Dean gave him much influence in moulding the policy of\r\nthe University in regard to scientific education. A series of verses,\r\napparently never published, but written in support of an appeal for\r\nmore funds for university purposes, adopts a very different note from\r\nthe earlier verses which we have quoted, and show that too much stress\r\nshould not be laid upon those as representing more than a passing mood.\r\n\r\nIn 1893, in addition to various papers, a volume of collected essays\r\nand addresses was published as _Fragments of Earth Lore_. But this\r\nmust have been merely a piece of byplay, as it were, for during 1892\r\nand 1893 the laborious task of bringing _The Great Ice Age_ up to date\r\nwas being carried on. Thus on 29th January 1893 he writes to Prof.\r\nChamberlin of Chicago, saying:--\r\n\r\n\r\n I have been busy of late in completing a new edition of my _Great\r\n Ice Age_. So long a time has passed since the publication of the\r\n last edition that I have found it necessary to rewrite the book. The\r\n labour of boiling down the evidence obtained by the geologists of\r\n Scandinavia, Russia, France, New Zealand, Italy, Spain, etc., has been\r\n very great, and has rather taken it out of me, so that for the present\r\n I am compelled to lay my MS. aside and do nothing!\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the interval of rest can only have been brief, for he writes again\r\non 12th March, saying:--\r\n\r\n\r\n I am again slowly working at my book, in hope that I may have it\r\n in the printer’s hands by the end of summer.... I have been truly\r\n astonished to find that the voluminous materials which have been\r\n collected during the last seventeen years in Europe, group themselves\r\n without the least difficulty into a coherent and intelligible whole.\r\n Until I had tabulated the results I was hardly prepared to find that\r\n the evidence from all parts of Europe tallied so closely. Each bit of\r\n the puzzle seems to drop into its place with ease.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hope expressed in this letter was not fulfilled, for nearly a\r\nyear later, on 20th January 1894, we find him writing again to Prof.\r\nChamberlin, saying:--\r\n\r\n\r\n In the course of week or two I hope to complete my new edition of\r\n _The Great Ice Age_. The revision has given me more trouble than I\r\n expected, chiefly on account of the large number of foreign papers\r\n which I have had to read and digest, for I was anxious to exhaust the\r\n evidence as far as I could....\r\n\r\n I am hoping to put the manuscript in the printer’s hands by the end\r\n of March or middle of April. I give myself that additional time, for\r\n I wish to take another look at some of the deposits on the Baltic\r\n coast lands before finally parting with my MS. As soon as I get rid\r\n of my College duties I shall start on my flying visit to Denmark,\r\n etc. Some very remarkable evidence has turned up recently in Tasmania\r\n and Australia. Geologists will have to reconsider their notions as\r\n to glaciation of our Antipodes in the light of the newly discovered\r\n evidence. I much wish that I had a long purse, unlimited time at my\r\n disposal, and a younger earthly tabernacle, for under those happy\r\n conditions I should sail straight away for the South, to see what I\r\n could see.\r\n\r\n\r\nProf. Chamberlin was supplying a sketch of the glacial phenomena of\r\nNorth America, which forms Chapters XLI. and XLII. of the completed\r\nbook, and the correspondence between the two went on during the greater\r\npart of this year, for the book was not published till autumn.\r\n\r\nOn 4th May he writes:--\r\n\r\n\r\n I have just returned from a few weeks’ holiday in the Baltic coast\r\n lands of North Germany and Denmark, where I had another opportunity of\r\n studying the great moraines of the Baltic Glacier.... I am quite ready\r\n for press--all the maps are engraved--and am most anxious to have the\r\n book set up and corrected for press before the end of July. I shall\r\n probably go abroad then: and it would be impossible to revise proofs\r\n away from my library.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the summer Prof. Geikie had a visit from his friend Prof. Stevenson\r\nof New York. In an undated letter to the latter, apparently written in\r\nearly summer, arranging details about the visit, he says:--\r\n\r\n\r\n I am sorry to hear about the nervousness. Having had it myself--for\r\n three years--I know what it means. But, courage! _mon ami_, with care\r\n you can stave off the enemy. The beast has been threatening me again\r\n for some months past. But the work which caused him to look in upon\r\n me, with his infernal grin, is now all but finished. In a fortnight I\r\n shall be a free man! Then geology may go hang till winter. I wish I\r\n had a long sail across the briny again, to Fiji or anywhere out of the\r\n busy haunts of man.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe summer holiday was spent at Traquair on the Tweed, and in a letter\r\nto Sir George Douglas written from there on 10th August, Prof. Geikie\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n\r\n I had thought at one time of going to the Continent, but here it is\r\n more restful and that is what I wish. I have no news of any kind, but\r\n am happy to say that I have at last escaped from the printer’s devil.\r\n My _Penelope’s Web_ is out of my hands at last: and I shall do nothing\r\n for the next month or two save loaf about the hills.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut as always there were delays at the last, and a month later he\r\nwrites to thank Prof. Chamberlin for some additional notes, saying:--\r\n\r\n\r\n The notes were quite in time to be inserted in the proofs. The book\r\n will not be “out” before October. The engravers have kept us back a\r\n little; but it is no joke revising the proofs of 850 pages.... You may\r\n be sure that an early copy of my book will be sent to you as soon as I\r\n can get it out of the publisher’s hands. I am sorry, however, that it\r\n is so big. I did what I could in the way of compression; but there is\r\n so much new to tell.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the autumn a very pleasant incident occurred, and as it is recorded\r\nin letters sent to Prof. Chamberlin, they may be permitted to tell the\r\ntale:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  _19th Oct 1894._\r\n\r\n A short time ago I had a most gratifying letter from the Glacialists’\r\n Excursion-party of the Geological Congress. The party (thirty in\r\n number) embraced some of the best known European glacialists, and was\r\n under the guidance of Penck, Brückner, and Du Pasquier. They went over\r\n the sections showing the glacial succession in the Alpine Lands, and\r\n were convinced that Penck’s interpretation of the facts were correct.\r\n In short, they admit that there have been at least three separate\r\n glacial epochs, and each separated from the other by long-continued\r\n valley-erosion during interglacial times. The letter sent to me was\r\n signed by all the excursionists. The evidence, indeed, is so striking\r\n that one wonders that Alpine geologists should have been so tardy in\r\n recognising it!\r\n\r\n\r\n  _29th Nov. 1894._\r\n\r\n I do not think there would be any impropriety in publishing the letter\r\n I received from the glacialists, and you are welcome to use it for\r\n the _Journal_ if you think it worth while. The import of the letter\r\n appeared in some German newspapers at the time; but I never thought\r\n of publishing it here. Yet I see no reason why it should not appear\r\n in your _Journal_[5]--only, I may be accused of personal vanity in\r\n sending it to you. But there is really no vain-glory in the matter,\r\n all that the writers say is simply that I would be pleased to see\r\n that they had studied the evidence adduced by Penck, Brückner, and Du\r\n Pasquier, and were convinced that the Alps had been glaciated three\r\n times. I therefore enclose a copy of the letter, the signatures being\r\n copied exactly as they are given. You will see the list includes some\r\n of the best known glacialists of Europe.\r\n\r\n    [5] _The Journal of Geology_, of which Prof. Chamberlin is joint\r\n    editor.\r\n\r\n\r\n  COPY OF LETTER\r\n\r\n  RESTAURANT SCHLOSSBERG\r\n  AM STARNBERGER SEE,\r\n  _Sept. 23, 1894_.\r\n\r\n DEAR PROFESSOR GEIKIE,--As members of the Glacialists’ Excursion we\r\n have studied the superposition of three successive glaciations and\r\n their interglacial deposits on both sides of the Alps, and we desire\r\n to address our congratulations to the Author of _The Great Ice Age_\r\n and to express our regret that you were unable to be one of the party\r\n and see for yourself a series of exposures which would have a very\r\n special interest for you.--We are, with sincere regards,\r\n\r\n Signed--\r\n\r\n  ALBRECHT PENCK.\r\n  EDUARD BRÜCKNER.\r\n  LÉON DU PASQUIER.\r\n  ANDRÉ DELEBECQUE.\r\n  HUGH ROBERT MILL, London.\r\n  Dr ANDR.

Prof. Stevenson says, under date\r\n30th May 1895:--\r\n\r\n\r\n I have been working away over your _Ice Age_. It is a wonder you\r\n were not frozen solid during the work. Collation and comparison of\r\n observations upon the American Carb.[6] are bad enough, but the\r\n conflicts are as nothing compared with those with which you have had\r\n to deal. I can well imagine that [you] felt as you penned the last\r\n chapter as Captain Marryat did once, when he closed the title of his\r\n last chapter with “And the author says ‘Thank God.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n    [6] That is the Carboniferous beds of North America, the work\r\n    upon which Prof. Stevenson was himself engaged.\r\n\r\nThe next few years were passed in the usual round of writing and\r\nteaching. In 1896 a third edition of the _Outlines of Geology_\r\nappeared, and in 1898 a number of lectures and papers were collected\r\ntogether in book form as _Earth Sculpture, or the Origin of\r\nLand-forms_, which ran through several editions.\r\n\r\nIn 1897 the Edinburgh Royal Society Club entertained Dr Nansen to\r\ndinner on his return from the _Fram_ expedition, and Prof. Geikie,\r\nwho was always the life of such gatherings, sang a song of his own\r\ncomposition which was greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nAmong the letters of these years, which include many to American and\r\ncontinental friends, is one to Prof. Stevenson from which the following\r\npassages, as representing a considered opinion, may be quoted:--\r\n\r\n\r\n It is certainly a pity that the men who can work and would fain devote\r\n themselves to original investigation, are often prevented doing so by\r\n the necessities of life. I am not so sure, however, that some of them\r\n would do work if they were placed in an independent position.... I’m\r\n much afraid that man on the whole is a lazy beast, and needs some kind\r\n of whip or bribe to make him live laborious days.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the course of 1900 Prof. Geikie had a pretty compliment paid to\r\nhim from across the Atlantic. On his first journey across he made the\r\nacquaintance of Mr Louis Elson, a professor of music at Boston. The\r\nfriendship so begun was kept up in later years, and Mr Elson dedicated\r\none of his books, _Shakespeare in Music_, to “Prof. James Geikie,\r\nLL.D., D.C.L., of Edinburgh University, with cordial remembrance of\r\nmany pleasant conferences on this and kindred topics.” Another American\r\nrecognition of his work was the naming by the U.S. Geological Survey\r\nof Mount Geikie, in the Wind River range of the Rocky Mountains in\r\nWyoming, in his honour. The mountain reaches a height of 12,546 feet.\r\nThe information has been kindly supplied by Mr J. G. Bruce of the\r\nForest Service, Lander, Wyoming.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of this year Prof. Geikie made a tour with a friend to\r\nthe Pyrenees, a tour which made a great impression upon him, and seems\r\nto have been an unqualified success. Some charming letters to his wife\r\ndescribe incidents of the journey, the letters, like all similar\r\nfamily correspondence, being full of regrets that no members of his own\r\nhousehold accompanied him. Though the visit was made very early in the\r\nseason, in the month of April, and the snow still lay deep in the high\r\nvalleys, the weather was almost perfect, and the two friends took many\r\nlong excursions. Among these was one to St Bertrand de Cominges, which\r\nattracted Prof. Geikie strongly. In a letter written from Luchon to Mrs\r\nGeikie in regard to it he says:--\r\n\r\n\r\n Yesterday we had a most interesting excursion to see an old fortified\r\n mediæval cathedral town. You would have enjoyed it. It was quaint and\r\n picturesque beyond measure. Evidently, now, cathedral and town are in\r\n a backwater--the flood of life has long gone past them. The church,\r\n however, contains magnificent wood-carving of the 13th century. It\r\n was the kind of town of which one sometimes dreams--hardly a town,\r\n but a sleepy village perched on a high rock with a wide outlook over\r\n the lowlands, and a grand view of the snow-capped mountains to the\r\n south. I saw one old house--or the top of it, rather--was for sale.\r\n It had quaint dormer windows and corbel gables, and was shut off from\r\n the narrow street by a high gate of weather-worn carved oak, hundreds\r\n of years old. I was tempted to buy it--when you and I tired of the\r\n world we could retreat to the seclusion of that sleepy old village,\r\n and dream the days away. The sun was as usual blazing from a cloudless\r\n sky, and as I leaned over the old battlements of the wall I could see\r\n that the wall from top to base was aflare with wallflowers and other\r\n plants, while mosses, ferns, and lichens were everywhere, every stone\r\n encrusted with moss and every crevice of the masonry stocked with\r\n flowers, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the same letter he says:--\r\n\r\n\r\n Walking in the scorching heat is most fatiguing. I had over\r\n twenty miles of such walking the other day, and will not repeat\r\n the experience. All the same I delight in the blaze--the heat and\r\n lightness seem to penetrate your skin and work their way to your very\r\n vitals. How one’s blood courses! and how the old youthful feelings\r\n come back!\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother passage from a later letter, written from Argelès, may be\r\nquoted, less for its description than for the light it casts upon the\r\ncharacter of its author. It may be noted that by this time he was the\r\nfather of the much longed-for “wee lassie,” who had been born a few\r\nyears before. He says:--\r\n\r\n\r\n The wee lassies are most delightful to look at. Many of them, as I\r\n have already mentioned, are little beauties. Such sweet, demure,\r\n kissable wee things they are, with their hair neatly done up, and\r\n hanging down in a plait behind. They are all bare-headed and all are\r\n dark. Brown to black hair, with soft liquid brown eyes, rich red lips,\r\n and a rosy flush in their tawny faces.... In years to come I will\r\n often dream of the bonny wee toddlers I stopped on the road to pet and\r\n fondle in these beautiful valleys. R. was as much struck as I with the\r\n children. But as I have my own wee lassie in my thoughts, he probably\r\n did not feel his heart in his mouth and his eyes water as the wee ones\r\n passed us on the road.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo these letters, written during the trip, may be added some extracts\r\nfrom one written to a member of the family circle after his return\r\nhome. On 29th May he writes from Edinburgh:--\r\n\r\n\r\n Since my return from France I have been driven from post to pillar,\r\n doing my best to clear off arrears. Now I am in a way “redd up,” and\r\n able to look round.... I feel quite rejuvenated with my trip.... I saw\r\n much that was very interesting to me as a geologist and much also that\r\n was beautiful, so that my memory is now stored with a fresh series of\r\n lovely visions--of picturesque and quaint people.... I have looked out\r\n one or two places to which some day I hope to take Mary and (if my\r\n purse is long enough) the wee lassie--that is when she is bigger! But\r\n half my life has been spent in dreams and plans for the future, and\r\n _some_ only of these have been realised.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe letter goes on to speak of that great May function in Edinburgh,\r\nthe Commissioner’s garden-party. Mrs Geikie and their eldest son were\r\nto go to this--“Stewart will go as ‘Professor Geikie.’ The professor\r\nhimself can’t be induced to go, and (as this is a holiday for him at\r\ncollege) he is taking Mary Dorothea out to Mortonhall Golf Club-house\r\nfor afternoon tea. The young lady has been looking forward to this\r\ntreat ever since I came home.”\r\n\r\nThe identity of the “young lady” will perhaps be apparent without\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\nIn 1901 Prof. Geikie was made an Honorary Member of the New York\r\nAcademy of Sciences, his name having been brought up by his friend\r\nProf. Stevenson. In writing to thank the latter he speaks of his hope\r\nof being again able to visit America, saying that as soon as “my lads\r\nclear out from the nest, it will be easier for Mrs Geikie and me to go\r\noff on a long holiday.” The future careers of his sons were at this\r\ntime occupying a large share of his thoughts, for the three elder boys\r\nwere ready to begin life on their own account.\r\n\r\nHe had a few years before taken to bicycling, and was full of the\r\npleasure and health he found in the exercise. During this year also\r\nhis friend, Mr Elson of Boston, paid the family a visit at Beauly\r\nduring the summer holiday, a visit of which Mr Elson speaks with\r\nboth enthusiasm and gratitude in later letters.\r\n\r\nThe next year or two repeat the same tale of work and play, the latter\r\nincluding much bicycling, and a visit to Norway in 1903. In 1903 he\r\nwrites to his eldest son:--“To-day I am sixty-four, and feel no older\r\nthan I was twenty years ago. Indeed I am younger than I was four or\r\nfive years ago.” Of work it need only be said that new editions of two\r\nof his books appeared in these years, _Earth Sculpture_ in 1902, and\r\n_Outlines of Geology_ (fourth edition) in 1903. Mention of an entirely\r\nnew book may be reserved for the next chapter. A pleasant little\r\nincident of the summer of 1903 was a postcard from the Glacialists’\r\nExcursion of the International Geological Congress, who sent, from\r\nTelfs in Tyrol, “Greetings and best wishes to the Nestor of Glacial\r\nGeology.” Such greetings were a frequent and always a pleasant\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nRETIREMENT FROM THE PROFESSORSHIP AND LAST DAYS\r\n\r\n1904-1915\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring 1904 Prof. Geikie began to suffer from an affection of the\r\nknee which troubled him for some years, and proved to be a form of\r\nrheumatism. In October he writes to his son telling him of the progress\r\nof his new book, which was published the next year as _Structural and\r\nField Geology for Students_, and in a few years’ time ran into a second\r\nedition. With his usual optimism he hoped to have it out early in\r\nthe New Year, if not before, but by the following April he was still\r\nbusy with proofs, and publication did not occur till June. Writing in\r\nApril he says:--“The last sheet of my book will be off to the printer\r\nto-morrow, and the book itself will, I hope, appear before the end of\r\nthe month. I shall feel like a fish out of water with no scribbling\r\non hand. Nothing like it for filling up vacant hours.” When writing\r\nthis letter he was on the eve of starting off for a visit to Ayr, in\r\nthe hope that a course of bicycling would “supple” the leg. In this,\r\nhowever, he was disappointed, and in summer he and Mrs Geikie went to\r\nWildbad in Würtemberg, where he hoped to find a cure.\r\n\r\nThe baths, temporarily at least, did him much good, but his\r\nfellow-patients, mostly of German nationality, did not please him, and\r\nhis letters are full of humorous complaints in regard to them. He was\r\nkeenly interested also in the nature of the water, being convinced that\r\nits curative properties were not due to the constituents apparent on\r\nanalysis but to some of the rarer elements, such as radium, present\r\nthough undetected. The suggestion has been made and confirmed in regard\r\nto other waters since, but his keenness on the problem is of interest\r\nas showing that there was no failure of mental power. His letters to\r\nhis doctor son on the physiological effects of the waters are full\r\nof his old _verve_ and clearness of exposition. Characteristically,\r\nhowever, he breaks off the scientific discussion to speak of the “fat\r\nFraus and Herren,” whom he and his wife daily watch “as they slowly\r\nwaddle and roll to and fro” near the Trinkhalle. His impressions he\r\nsums up in the following verses:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    The typical Frau, to my British mind,\r\n    Is preposterous in front and prodigious behind:\r\n    Her digestion is sound--for, ’tis very clear,\r\n    Her grub she dissolves in an ocean of beer.\r\n    Her lord, who is equally round and obese,\r\n    Rolls along by her side, with a grunt and a wheeze--\r\n    Rolls along, did I say?--they do not roll far,\r\n    But rotate within reasonable reach of a bar.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith perhaps some recollection of his early studies of Heine, he takes\r\neye measurements of the average German lady, and winds up with a vivid\r\ndescription of an ordinary German’s meal, and a disgusted--“But the\r\nmost of these people are gross eaters.”\r\n\r\nDuring 1906, as indeed until his death, he was carrying on a constant\r\ncorrespondence with Prof. Stevenson of New York, in which many\r\nquestions--geological, social, political, personal, and so forth--came\r\nup for discussion. Thus in January 1906 he says, speaking of his sons\r\nand their careers:--“All the birds are out of our nest now, all save\r\none wee lassie who remains to brighten our hearts with laughter and\r\nsong.” By this time his eldest son was established in a practice at\r\nAyr, the next two were working as mining engineers in Borneo, and the\r\nyoungest was studying music in Germany.\r\n\r\nDuring this year the rheumatic knee still troubled him, and a visit\r\nto Harrogate to try the waters there did not produce much permanent\r\nbenefit. The summer was spent in Ayrshire, but was saddened by the\r\nsudden death of a favourite niece, who had been almost a daughter of\r\nthe house during the long years when the family consisted only of boys,\r\nand was on holiday with her uncle and aunt at the time of the acute\r\nillness which caused her death.\r\n\r\nIn 1907 his eldest son was married, and there is a charming letter\r\nwritten to him on his wedding tour, with much wise advice about\r\nmatrimony, mingled with personal experiences. Among other things the\r\nwriter says:--“When I went on my honeymoon I took a geological hammer\r\nwith me, but the geology did not count for much. I think the hammer\r\nwas used chiefly for digging up roots and ferns for your mother, or\r\nfor knocking off bits of rock that were covered with gay lichens.” The\r\nyoung couple had gone to Devonshire, and this sent the father back to\r\nHerrick, and that writer’s description of “dull Devonshire.”\r\n\r\nIn the autumn Prof. Geikie had the pleasure of meeting Prof. Stevenson\r\nof New York, who came to London for the Centenary Celebration of the\r\nGeological Society there. At the end of November he writes to his\r\neldest son, saying:--“My work at College is easy this winter, for I\r\nfeel in much better health than I have done for two or three years.\r\nMy lameness is practically cured, and I begin to think that I may yet\r\nbe able to go with May to her first ball, and dance a reel with the\r\nnicest-looking girl in the room--as usual.”\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1908 Prof. and Mrs Geikie and their daughter, together\r\nwith a niece, went to Portugal, which they all enjoyed greatly. In the\r\nearly part of this year also the first grandchild, a little girl, was\r\nborn. Another event of the year was the translation of _Structural\r\nGeology_ into French.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence with Prof. Stevenson was still going on, and\r\nthere was an interesting letter from the latter in August. He was\r\ncontemplating retiral from his professorship, while Prof. Geikie had\r\nno wish to give up his own post, and the two discussed the question of\r\nthe desirable age for the event. Prof. Stevenson wished to have leisure\r\nto complete some private work of his own, and his letter contains the\r\nfollowing interesting passage:--\r\n\r\n\r\n You were a fortunate man: you struck out into an unexplored field and\r\n you lived to correct your own errors. Yours became the monumental\r\n monograph on the Glacial period: the volume is in all libraries\r\n and it never can be ignored safely by even the shrewdest and most\r\n unscrupulous of borrowers. A merciful Providence directed your steps\r\n toward a problem of world-wide interest. Your great-grandchildren will\r\n see your work quoted in all standard treatises. Like the rest of us\r\n you have brought many loads of bricks for the geological edifice, but,\r\n unlike most of us, you have shared in the work of construction.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe summer of this year was spent at an east coast watering-place,\r\nwhere the weather was wet and cold. Prof. Geikie was frankly bored, and\r\nexpresses himself in a letter to his eldest son with a vividness which\r\nwill appeal to all who have had a similar experience. The letter is\r\nlong--its composition was doubtless the occupation of a hopelessly bad\r\nday--and we shall quote only some extracts:--“Our rooms are so small we\r\nare constantly tumbling over each other and gnashing our teeth at each\r\nother.... I have got to loathe that beach, and to hate the sound of the\r\nwaves, and the smells of the village, and the raucous voices of the\r\nnatives and their sluttish ways. I have been reading a very interesting\r\nbook upon the cemeteries of Etruria. Some of the painted sepulchres\r\nmust be quite cheerful, and I really think if one could hire such a\r\ntomb for the summer it would be better than taking a house in Caledonia\r\nstern and wild. Of course we should only sleep in the sepulchre--a\r\ngood lamp would give all the light required. We should select one on\r\na hill-side near to which no motors could possibly come, quiet and\r\nretired, with only sheep and cattle for our neighbours.... From the\r\ndoorway of the tomb we could feast our eyes on unrivalled scenery, bask\r\nin the sun, scent the soft zephyrs with the aroma of tobacco, and envy\r\nno man.... The geology would interest me, but what I would chiefly\r\nenjoy would be blue skies, warm sunshine, absence of whirlwinds and\r\ntornadoes, with none of that blighting easterly haar. No wonder the\r\nmajority of Scotsmen are Calvinists and Radicals--their country is\r\nenough to make them that--and worse, if it were possible.”\r\n\r\nA little later in the letter, however, he admits to having had\r\none really good day, when he and Mrs Geikie made an excursion\r\ntogether:--“We had a bag loaded up with grub, kettle, teapot, spirit\r\nlamp, etc., the weight of which was not inconsiderable. I would have\r\ndropped it, but your mother was so happy with the prospect of tea by\r\nthe sad seashore, that my heart melted within me. (I must say, however,\r\nthat my whole body was in a melting condition before we got back.)”\r\n\r\nIn 1909 his second grandchild was born, another girl, which brings from\r\nthe grandfather the remark:--“Girls are far the nicest, especially when\r\na father gets old and wants some one to bring him his slippers, or to\r\nfill and light his pipe. Boys are of no use in a family; they only make\r\nnoises, damage the furniture, harass their mothers--and, in short, they\r\nare the very devil.” Writing in March to his son, he returns to the\r\nquestion of his resignation, saying:--“For myself, I don’t feel like\r\nresigning just yet! I can walk like any other Christian, and enjoy my\r\nwork as much as ever: and my class keeps up its numbers.”\r\n\r\nIn the summer he had an invitation to go to Boston to be present at\r\nthe inauguration of Dr Abbott Lawrence Lowell as President of Harvard\r\nUniversity, and at the same time to deliver another series of lectures\r\nat the Lowell Institute in Boston. He refused the invitation, however,\r\nthough with regret, for he shrank from the long voyage across the\r\nAtlantic. Another pleasant incident of the year was the publication\r\nof Profs. Penck and Brückner’s _Die Alpen im Eiszeitalter_, which was\r\ndedicated to “James Geikie, dem Verfasser von _The Great Ice Age_, dem\r\nLandsmann von John Playfair.”\r\n\r\nOne of the two authors of the book, Prof. Penck of Berlin, was, as has\r\nbeen indicated here, an old friend of Prof. Geikie’s. The two first met\r\nin 1883, and, as we have already stated, Prof. Penck had repeatedly\r\nacknowledged his scientific debt to the author of _The Great Ice\r\nAge_, while there was a personal tie in addition. In 1914 Prof. Penck\r\nreceived the Gold Medal of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society, and\r\nwas Prof. Geikie’s guest at the time when the presentation was made.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of that fateful year, however, Prof. Penck was one of the\r\nforeign guests at the Australian meeting of the British Association,\r\nand was in Australia at the outbreak of war. In the opinion of his\r\nhosts, his behaviour, in an admittedly difficult situation, lacked\r\nthe perfect “correctness” which was desirable, and this both in\r\nAustralia and on the homeward journey. Some indiscretions in the way\r\nof sketching and photographing in the vicinity of military works led\r\nto his being detained for a time in London on his return. During this\r\nperiod he corresponded with Prof. Geikie on geological matters. After\r\nthe latter’s death he wrote to Mrs Geikie from Germany a letter which,\r\nin spite of the circumstances indicated above, and in spite also of\r\ncertain phrases which jar, cannot be regarded as anything but sincere.\r\nWe quote from it the following passages, which form a notable tribute.\r\nThe letter, it should be stated, was written in English:--\r\n\r\n\r\n James Geikie belongs to those who have influenced most my scientific\r\n evolution. His clear way of seeing things and his reasoning made a\r\n convincing impression on me, and though I never listened to one of\r\n his lectures, I felt always to be one of his students. He was my\r\n master. His _Great Ice Age_ showed me the ways to understand the\r\n glacial deposits of Central Europe: his _Prehistoric Europe_ arose my\r\n interest for prehistoric questions: his views on mountains, valleys\r\n and lakes gave me the base for my morphological work. He made me also\r\n acquainted with English and Scotch, with the life on the other side of\r\n the Channel, with English poetry, for he was a poet himself. And now\r\n he is dead, and he died in the year of the great war, which breaks the\r\n strongest links between our peoples.\r\n\r\n I am not superstitious and I do not lay stress on this coincidence\r\n of facts. I hope what I believe he would hope too, that the struggle\r\n of the nations will have one day its end, and that peace will come\r\n again which unites the different nations for great scientific works.\r\n But while the peoples are still fighting, I must express my heartiest\r\n sympathy to my old friend’s wife.\r\n\r\n\r\nReturning to the chronological order of events in Prof. Geikie’s\r\nlast years, we find that the year 1910 was an unfortunate one, for\r\nhe had a sharp attack of pneumonia in the spring. From this he made\r\neventually a wonderful recovery, but the process was somewhat slow.\r\nBefore his illness he had begun the book which was published in 1913\r\nas _Mountains: their Origin, Growth, and Decay_, but his health, and\r\nthe time it took to collect the beautiful illustrations, delayed its\r\nappearance. A letter from his brother, Sir Archibald, in September 1910\r\nto Mrs Geikie speaks of his wonderful recovery, and goes on to say:--“I\r\nhope he won’t overtax his strength at College. With so splendid an\r\ninstallation for the Geological Department the temptation to do so must\r\nbe great. I don’t know of any college or university that is better\r\nfitted out for geological teaching than Edinburgh now is.”\r\n\r\nIn this year Prof. Geikie retired from the presidentship of the Royal\r\nScottish Geographical Society, and his retiral was the occasion of the\r\npresentation of his portrait, painted by Mr A. E. Walton, R.S.A., to\r\nthe Society, a replica being at the same time given to Mrs Geikie. The\r\nceremony of unveiling took place in the Society’s Rooms on 7th November\r\n1911, when Prof. Geikie’s old friend and colleague, Dr John Horne,\r\ngave a short address on the scientific career of the original of the\r\nportrait.\r\n\r\nIt may be noted here that the fact that Dr Horne had for many years\r\nbeen living in Edinburgh explains the absence of letters in later\r\nyears, for personal intercourse had taken the place of correspondence.\r\nDr Horne retired from the Geological Survey in this year of 1911, and\r\nin a letter to Prof. Stevenson, Prof. Geikie speaks of a dinner given\r\nto him by present and former colleagues on the occasion of his retiral.\r\nWriting in March, he says:--“Last night Dr Horne (Geol. Survey)\r\nwas entertained by his present and former colleagues. My brother,\r\nwonderfully hale and hearty, was in the Chair. Horne retires from the\r\nSurvey in June. It seems a short time ago when he first started work in\r\nthe Survey as a lad under my guidance. But upon reflection I see the\r\n‘short time’ = 44 years! When I think of it, old age seems to have come\r\nupon me all at once.”\r\n\r\nOther incidents of 1911 were a spring holiday in Devonshire and a\r\nsummer one in Switzerland, while in autumn Prof. and Mrs Geikie were\r\nat the Centenary celebrations at St Andrews University. Of these,\r\nProf. Geikie sends a lively description to his daughter. He enjoyed\r\nthe proceedings very much on the whole, but found many of the meetings\r\nand entertainments too long for his taste and strength. Of one dinner\r\nhe complains that the speakers “not only exhausted time but encroached\r\nupon eternity.”\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the year, now that the question of resignation was\r\nbeginning to demand an early decision, Prof. Geikie resolved to present\r\nto the University the large collection of books and pamphlets which he\r\nand his brother Sir Archibald had made for the use of the students of\r\nthe geological classes. A letter from the Secretary of the University\r\nCourt, written at the close of December, says:--“The Court desires me\r\nto communicate to you, and through you to your brother, Sir Archibald,\r\nin conjunction with whom this valuable collection of scientific works\r\nwas made, their most cordial thanks. The loyalty to ‘Alma Mater,’ on\r\nthe part of Sir Archibald and yourself, has been warmly appreciated by\r\nthe Court.”\r\n\r\nThe chief incident of 1912 was a visit to London to take part in the\r\ncelebrations of the 250th anniversary of the Royal Society, of which\r\nhis brother, Sir Archibald, was president. In the following year\r\nProf. Geikie was elected President of the Royal Society of Edinburgh,\r\nan honour of which he was very proud. He held this position while\r\nhis brother was still President of the London Society--a somewhat\r\nremarkable coincidence. In writing to congratulate him on the\r\nappointment, Sir Archibald says:--“I hope it will not give as much work\r\nand worry as my Chair here has given me.”\r\n\r\nIn the early part of 1913 Prof. Geikie delivered in Edinburgh the\r\nMunro lectures, which were published the following year as _The\r\nAntiquity of Man in Europe_, and of it his old friend Prof. Stevenson\r\nsays:--“This is no old man’s book.” In 1913, as already stated, the\r\nbook on _Mountains_ was published, and was dedicated to the author’s\r\n“Old Friends and Colleagues on the Council of the Royal Scottish\r\nGeographical Society.”\r\n\r\nThe summer of 1913 was spent in Skye, and there Prof. Geikie employed\r\nhis leisure, as so often in holiday times, in writing verses. A few\r\nstanzas may be quoted:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Tired of Auld Reekie’s stink and din,\r\n      My thoughts fly far away,\r\n    And bear me on until I win\r\n      The shores of Broadford Bay.\r\n\r\n    O there, I know, the heavens are bright,\r\n      Keen is the air and pure,\r\n    And calm the day, and still the night,\r\n      And rest and sleep secure.\r\n\r\n    Auld Reekie, very dear art thou,\r\n      And yet, tho’ fair to see,\r\n    Ten months within thy gates, I trow,\r\n      Are quite enough for me.\r\n\r\n    .      .      .      .      .\r\n\r\n    Ended at last the weary round!\r\n      Good-bye to leaden skies:\r\n    With every mile we onward bound\r\n      Our spirits higher rise.\r\n\r\n    Onward o’er straths, thro’ mountain glens,\r\n      Past shimmering lochs and streams,\r\n    Until we view, with all its Bens,\r\n      The island of our dreams.\r\n\r\n    And there we live the life that’s good,\r\n      No care, no stress, no strain,\r\n    With heart revived and brain renewed,\r\n      Lost youth comes back again.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut if, as these verses show, holiday times still as of yore brought a\r\nsudden rebound of spirits, the strain of life was obviously beginning\r\nto tell. A pathetic letter has been preserved which was written to\r\nan old student, now Dr M‘Alpine of the Department of Agriculture,\r\nVictoria, in the spring of 1914. In it the writer says:--“Edinburgh has\r\nchanged much within the last thirty years. To me it is a very different\r\nplace, for I have seen so many of my old friends and companions pass\r\naway. The ghosts of those I have lost crowd about me, and like every\r\nold chap I feel the pathos of life. But I cultivate the philosophy of\r\nDaft Jamie Gordon, and believe it ‘as weel to dee goin’ as sittin’.’ So\r\nI work away and still find much to interest me in this workaday world.”\r\n\r\nIn an accompanying letter Dr M‘Alpine recalls an incident of his\r\nstudent days which made a great impression upon him. One day, while\r\nwith a party who were being taken over Arthur’s Seat by Prof. Geikie,\r\nthe discussion turned from the igneous rocks of the hill to the\r\nevidences of former glaciation. Prof. Geikie carefully removed the\r\nturf from some rocks near the summit to show the finger-marks of the\r\nvanished ice, and then as carefully replaced the grass in order that\r\nthe evidence of the past might be preserved. For one of his students at\r\nleast the unconscious act read an unforgettable lesson of reverence.\r\n\r\nThis message from across the sea may serve to suggest how much gain\r\ncame from those years which sometimes seemed to be spent largely in\r\na weary round of drudgery. It is not only in his books that the dead\r\nman still speaks to the world. That, in fair weather and in foul,\r\nin the prime of manhood and when age was creeping on, Prof. Geikie\r\nled successive bands of often raw youths and maidens over those\r\nhill-sides, has helped to give them an interest which Nature alone\r\ncould not give, a charm which untrodden ways can never attain. On those\r\ngrassy slopes an old man saw visions and young men dreamed dreams, and\r\nthe dreams and the visions have become a part of our island heritage.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1914 Prof. and Mrs Geikie went to stay at Appin. A\r\nfriend of the family, a keen entomologist, was to have been of the\r\nparty, but was at the last unable to come. From Appin Prof. Geikie sent\r\nher a series of verses to console her for the disappointment, which was\r\nnot, he says, really a disappointment, for a heavy storm had destroyed\r\nall insect life in her customary collecting-grounds. A few of the lines\r\nmay be quoted:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    O come nae mair to Appin, lass!\r\n    Here things are at an unco’ pass!\r\n    A tempest rages o’er the land,\r\n    Uprootin’ trees on every hand;\r\n    Cauld rains and sleet in torrents fa’--\r\n    The hills are hidden, ane and a’;\r\n    Naething but waves and clouds we find,\r\n    Naething we hear but screechin’ wind.\r\n    Ahint the dykes, wi’ heads downcast,\r\n    The kye seek shelter frae the blast;\r\n    Distracted wi’ the wintry weather\r\n    The sheep are huddled a’ thagether:\r\n    The birds, puir things, are blawn awa’--\r\n    Even the sea-mew and the craw.\r\n    You needna come to Appin noo\r\n    The wiley beetle to pursue:\r\n    Clockers and bugs o’ every kind\r\n    Are bashed and batter’d by the wind,\r\n    And kill’d are a’ the chrysalises--\r\n    Dear to the heart o’ learned Misses.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Appin also the family returned in summer, after Prof. Geikie’s\r\nretirement from the Chair at Edinburgh, and it was there that they got\r\nthe news of the outbreak of war. Prof. Geikie gave his last lecture at\r\nEdinburgh on 19th June, and his successor, a former student of his own,\r\nProf. Jehu of St Andrews, was appointed shortly afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the story is soon told, for Prof. Geikie’s hope that his\r\nretiral from the professorship would give him time for his own work\r\nwas not destined to be fulfilled. The autumn was spent--as all spent\r\nthat fateful autumn--in watching and waiting, but unlike some of his\r\nfellow-countrymen, Prof. Geikie, if he never doubted of the ultimate\r\nresult, was yet sure from the first that the war would be long and\r\nterrible. He was not well throughout the winter, for an attack of\r\ninfluenza in November weakened him, and he seemed to have lost his\r\npower of recovery. Later he suffered from his old enemy, dyspepsia,\r\nthough there did not appear to be any particular cause for alarm. On\r\nthe 1st of March he died suddenly as the result of a heart attack, some\r\nmonths before completing his seventy-sixth year.\r\n\r\nHe died as he would himself have wished to die, without any slow\r\nprogress of decay, and without knowledge that the end was so near.\r\n\r\nHis contributions to science are discussed in the section which\r\nfollows: his personal character should be apparent from what has been\r\nalready said, without the need of an elaborate analysis. As a friend\r\nwrote to Mrs Geikie in the first days of her loss:--“There was always\r\nan out-of-door atmosphere about him, like a strong wind sweeping over\r\nthe moors bringing life and health with it;” for the hills and open\r\ncountry which he loved had taught him much.\r\n\r\nIn sum, he was through and through one of the island folk, a true\r\nnative of “this little island, this England,” with its wide, wind-swept\r\nmoorlands, its disciplined freedom, its ordered life, and had in\r\naddition the strong individuality of the northerner to whom nothing\r\ncomes without labour. Even the _milieu_ in which he was born is\r\nsignificant, for it was that from which so many of the intellectuals of\r\nScotland have come; and it is noteworthy that he remained a Scot to the\r\nend, at once fiercely critical of his country and fellow-countrymen,\r\nand full of intense love for the one and of profound sympathy with the\r\nother. He never, like some anglicised Scots, sold his birthright for\r\na mess of pottage, or faltered in the conviction that he was the heir\r\nof a glorious heritage, won by the toil and sweat of generations, and\r\nthe result was to give something of that poise and assuredness which\r\nthose who are false to their own traditions can never possess. It\r\nwill be clear also that there was nothing of the dry-as-dust pedant\r\nabout him, for he was above all things a man, one for whom life in all\r\nits aspects was sweet. He gave freely--to the world of his labours,\r\nto his intimates of his affection, and he received much--honour from\r\nhis fellows, and what he perhaps prized more, the love of those who\r\nknew the real man beneath the northern shyness and reserve.\r\n\r\nAll is transitory--his conclusions may be disputed, new lights may\r\nbe thrown on problems which seemed to him conclusively solved; but\r\nthe nation which can produce such men can never be poor, and his\r\nuprightness, steadfastness, and simplicity of character enabled him to\r\nleave an abiding imprint upon his day and generation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL WORK\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE GLACIAL PROBLEM BEFORE JAMES GEIKIE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1861, at the age of twenty-two, James Geikie, as stated in Chapter\r\nII., became an officer of the Geological Survey and determined to\r\ndevote his life to scientific work.\r\n\r\nFor seventy years, ever since the time of the great discussions\r\nabout the theories of Hutton and Playfair in the closing days of the\r\neighteenth century, the inhabitants of Edinburgh had been keenly alive\r\nto the attractions of geological speculation. These older controversies\r\nhad died down, and the science was gradually establishing itself on a\r\nbroad basis of recorded facts and observations. It was not yet included\r\namong the subjects which had a place of honour in the University\r\ncurriculum, though the professors of natural history since the time of\r\nJameson had delivered lectures on geology (or geognosy as it was often\r\ncalled). Prof. Edward Forbes, who succeeded Jameson, and Prof. Fleming\r\n(of the Theological College) were both accomplished geologists. The\r\nEdinburgh Geological Society had been established in 1834, and though\r\nit did not as yet publish _Transactions_, it included many active\r\ngeologists in the list of its members. Geology, with its mixture of\r\nopen-air activities, hard facts of observation, and rich opportunities\r\nfor speculative controversy, has always possessed an attraction for\r\nScotsmen, and many of them have excelled in it. In the Scottish capital\r\nin the early sixties the burly figure of Hugh Miller was very well\r\nknown. His writings, with their curious mixture of geological and\r\ntheological matters, of fossil fishes and final causes, were very\r\nwidely read at that time, and the sad tragedy of his death, the result\r\nof an overworked brain, was fresh in the memory of all.\r\n\r\nA man of very different qualities, but a brilliant and thoroughly\r\nreliable geologist, who held a high place in the intellectual life\r\nof Edinburgh, was Charles Maclaren, one of the founders and for many\r\nyears the editor of the _Scotsman_ newspaper. His special field of\r\nwork was the geology of the district around the Firth of Forth, a\r\nregion filled with the most striking examples of geological structure\r\nand the effects of geological processes. Maclaren was constantly\r\nexploring the phenomena of this neighbourhood, and the results of\r\nhis observations appeared regularly as articles in the _Scotsman_.\r\nNo doubt this kept the science prominently before the public; few\r\nnewspapers at the present time would venture to print columns of exact\r\nand rather technical description of the geological features of the\r\ndistrict in which they are published. Maclaren died in August 1866, the\r\nyear in which a second and much enlarged edition of his volume on the\r\n_Geology of Fife and the Lothians_ was published. In the same year the\r\n_Transactions of the Edinburgh Geological Society_ began to appear, but\r\nthe Royal Physical Society, a successor of the Wernerian Society, had\r\nfor several years been issuing _Proceedings_. Archibald Geikie had read\r\na paper on the Geology of Strath in Skye to the Edinburgh Geological\r\nSociety in 1853, and among the geologists of note who attended the\r\nmeetings were Rose, Dr Page, Prof. Foster Heddle, and Dr Hunter of\r\nCarluke. Dr Page, afterwards Professor of Geology at Newcastle-on-Tyne,\r\nwas a well-known popular lecturer on geology, and did a good deal to\r\nkeep alive an interest in the science.\r\n\r\nIn later years James Geikie often acknowledged his indebtedness to\r\nProf. George Wilson, and the stimulus he had received from him when\r\na young man bent on scientific studies. Wilson was Professor of\r\nTechnology in Edinburgh University, a subject no longer included in the\r\nUniversity curriculum. It seems to have comprised parts of dynamics,\r\nmechanical engineering and applied chemistry. Wilson was a man of great\r\npersonal charm, exceedingly well informed, and always willing to help\r\nyoung students along the path of learning. He was interested in geology\r\nalso, and undertook to write the life of Edward Forbes, but finished\r\nonly the first six chapters, and the work was ultimately completed by\r\nArchibald Geikie.\r\n\r\nAlthough James Geikie was always a great reader, it is not likely that\r\nhe had more than an elementary knowledge of geology when he joined the\r\nSurvey in 1861. Trained geologists, however, in those days were much\r\nless common than they are now, and the Survey was prepared to enrol\r\nmen who had a good general education and showed special inclination\r\nand aptitude for this line of work. Careful personal selection must\r\nhave been exercised, for many of those who then joined its ranks\r\nrose subsequently to high eminence in science. In field geology no\r\nbetter training could have been given than was adopted for these young\r\nmen. They were sent out day by day with surveyors who had acquired a\r\nknowledge of field work, and were inspected regularly by experienced\r\ngeologists, who corrected their errors and helped to solve their\r\ndifficulties. As already noted in Part I. (see p. 20), his first work\r\nwas the addition of drift lines to the solid maps of parts of Fife and\r\nthe Lothians, and the drifts of the low grounds of Central Scotland\r\nremained to the close of his life the subject which interested him\r\nabove all others, and with which he had the fullest acquaintance in the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nWhen Geikie began to map both the solid and drift geology of a hitherto\r\nunsurveyed district, he was sent to Ayrshire and West Lanarkshire,\r\nwhere he undertook the survey of a large area stretching from\r\nEaglesham southwards to New Cumnock. His brother was mapping, or had\r\nalready mapped, a broad strip extending inwards from the coast-line\r\nand reaching from near Largs in the north to Dailly in the south,\r\nwhile to the east of him was Peach engaged in the survey of Southern\r\nLanarkshire. In those days a fairly large area (several hundred square\r\nmiles) was assigned to each geologist. The whole district had to be\r\nvery carefully examined and the results recorded on topographical maps\r\non the scale of six inches to a mile. Each geologist was expected\r\nto make a complete examination of his ground and to note all the\r\nparticulars regarding it. Petrology was as yet in its infancy, and\r\nno very minute classification of volcanic rocks was to be expected;\r\nbut the glacial geology and economic geology were to be carefully\r\ninvestigated and fossil localities noted, though, for the purpose of\r\ncollecting fossils, the assistance of special officers was provided.\r\nThe determination of all fossils requiring critical skill was in the\r\nhands of the Survey palæontologists. Each geologist surveyed from a\r\nhundred to a hundred and fifty miles in a field season, which, allowing\r\nfor holidays, amounted to seven or eight months, and to do this\r\nrequired regular hard work, much strenuous walking, and the power of\r\nconcentrating on the general features, and not allowing one’s attention\r\nto be absorbed by inconsequent details.\r\n\r\nJames Geikie seems to have had no difficulty whatever in picking up the\r\nessentials of field geology. He was very diligent and had sufficient\r\nphysical strength for his work. In time he became a great walker,\r\nthinking nothing of covering fifty miles in a day. The open-air life\r\nsuited him perfectly. He had one of the gifts most valuable to a\r\nfield-geologist, sometimes described as “an eye for the country,”\r\nthe faculty of interpreting the geological meanings that underlie\r\nsurface features. Although never a professed palæontologist he had a\r\nworking knowledge of Carboniferous fossils, and he was always a keen\r\nand critical observer of rocks both in a fresh and in a weathered\r\ncondition. His early maps, judged even by the standards of the present\r\nday, were astonishingly good, and always give the impression that he\r\nwent thoroughly into the evidence so far as it was available. He was\r\ncautious and thorough, and as a result of this his maps show very few\r\ndeletions due to changes of opinion as fuller information was acquired\r\nduring the progress of his work. From the first he exhibited great\r\nability as a draughtsman, and his maps and sections are not only very\r\nclear, well-proportioned, and pleasing to the eye, but show also an\r\nindividuality which arose from natural gifts, and was not acquired by\r\ncopying models.\r\n\r\nAlthough at that time geologists on the Survey were not moved about\r\nthe country so frequently as is now the case, but settled down for\r\nseveral seasons in a well-defined area, James Geikie had no reason to\r\ncomplain of a lack of variety in the ground allotted to him. His early\r\nstations in Fife and Kinross included stratified and igneous rocks of\r\nOld Red Sandstone and of Carboniferous Age, and in Peeblesshire he\r\nmade acquaintance with Silurian rocks, which at that time were still\r\nvery imperfectly understood, and presented many difficult problems\r\nthen unsolved. It was in Ayrshire, however, that his powers most fully\r\ndisplayed themselves, and the long period of field work in that county\r\nfrom 1865 to 1872 undoubtedly saw the development of his abilities\r\nas a field-geologist. In after years many of the best illustrations\r\nboth of structural geology and of glacial geology that enlivened his\r\nbooks and his lectures were culled from the note-books in which he\r\nconstantly recorded the results of his observations in that field. From\r\nhis letters it seems that he disliked the coalfield geology, which\r\nnecessitated the examination of mining plans, frequent attendance at\r\ncolliery engineers’ offices, and great absorption in details which are\r\nof little general importance. But no one would have suspected this from\r\nhis field maps, which, if we remember how rapidly his work was done,\r\nshow much detail of underground structures taken from colliery plans.\r\n\r\nIn Ayrshire he had for colleagues Sir Archibald Geikie and Dr Peach;\r\none of these was ultimately to select volcanic geology as his province,\r\nwhile the other attained great eminence as a palæontologist. Already\r\nJames Geikie was absorbed in glacial geology; and each of the trio\r\nof geologists, though doing ostensibly the same work, had already\r\nchosen the special line of investigation in which he was ultimately to\r\nbecome a master. He had a great affection, too, for the warm-hearted,\r\nhospitable people of the west of Scotland, and in “braid Scots” used\r\nto relate many humorous episodes in which the sturdy farmers and “sma’\r\nlairds” displayed their pawky humour. No full or adequate account of\r\nthe work he did in Ayrshire in these years has ever been published.\r\nThe short descriptions of sheets 22, 23, and 19, published by the\r\nGeological Survey, were in large part written by James Geikie, but,\r\nowing to the necessities of official publication entailing great\r\nbrevity, they contain merely an outline of his main conclusions. The\r\ngeologists who revised that ground forty years after the original\r\nsurvey are unanimous in regretting that more adequate description of\r\nthe evidence which James Geikie had collected was not placed before the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Ayrshire he was transferred to Kelso, and subsequently to\r\nthe district ranging from Perth to Dunkeld. From a geological point of\r\nview this ground was considerably less varied; but as his note-books\r\nshow, he was by this time deeply absorbed in glacial and Pleistocene\r\ngeology, and every scrap of information regarding the latest stages\r\nin the physical history of Scotland was most carefully recorded and\r\nits importance weighed. Many of the conclusions he had already arrived\r\nat in Ayrshire were confirmed by fresh evidence in these years. And\r\nthe estuary of the Tay, with its rich succession of late-glacial\r\nand post-glacial accumulations, became of great importance in his\r\ninterpretation of the “glacial succession,” a subject to which the\r\nremainder of his life was devoted more than to any other.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances that determined his bent towards the investigation\r\nof glacial geology cannot perhaps be fully elucidated now in the\r\nabsence of any statement from his own pen, but it is not difficult\r\nto find many reasons that may have influenced him. In considering\r\nthis subject we may glance briefly at the state of knowledge of this\r\ndepartment of geology at the time when he began field work. The years\r\n1861 to 1865 saw a very remarkable development of interest in glacial\r\ngeology, occasioned by a sudden appreciation of the importance of\r\nmany facts previously well known but imperfectly understood. Many\r\nactive geologists in Scotland were coming for the first time to adopt\r\nthe views which have ultimately obtained acceptance in regard to the\r\nPleistocene history of Scotland, and the change of opinion which\r\nwas going on was somewhat similar to the still greater change which\r\ntook place when evolution first began to take the form of a working\r\nhypothesis or even an established law of Nature, and to sweep away a\r\ngreat many honoured and treasured theories that had long held sway over\r\nthe minds of men.\r\n\r\nThe superficial deposits of sand, clay, and stones that cover the solid\r\nrocks in the lower grounds of Scotland, often to a depth of many feet,\r\nwere considered by most geologists as being of somewhat mysterious\r\norigin. It was well known that they contained boulders transported from\r\na distance. Around Edinburgh and Glasgow, for example, large blocks\r\nof rock which must have been carried from the Southern Highlands,\r\nfifty miles or more, were familiar to those interested in geology.\r\nThat the surfaces of the rocks on which the drift or boulder-clay\r\nrested were striated, grooved, and fluted, was also a well-known fact.\r\nEarly in the nineteenth century a favourite explanation of these\r\ndeposits, which had been supported by the celebrated Dean Buckland,\r\nwas that they were the remains of the Deluge as described in Genesis.\r\nThis theory, however, was soon discarded though the name “Diluvial,”\r\nstill used by some writers to designate these strata, bears witness\r\nto the former acceptance of that hypothesis. For a long time they\r\ncontinued to be considered as flood deposits, laid down by “debacles”\r\nof obscure origin. No rational explanation for these powerful “waves of\r\ntranslation” could be formulated, and they failed completely to account\r\nfor the remarkable scratched surfaces on which the boulder-clay rested.\r\nAs the study of glaciers advanced, it became clear that moving ice,\r\nbearing debris with it, could produce striations exactly like those\r\nin question, and the boulder-clay gradually came to be considered a\r\nglacial deposit. Very important confirmation of this hypothesis came\r\nfrom the observations of Mr Smith of Jordanhill on the recent shelly\r\nclays of the west of Scotland. Many of the mollusca which these clays\r\ncontained proved to be of species now living in Arctic seas, and the\r\ninference was obvious that at no very distant epoch a glacial climate\r\nhad prevailed in Scotland. About the year 1837 Agassiz had been led by\r\nhis investigation of the boulder-clay of Switzerland to the conclusion\r\nthat at one time the glaciers had extended far beyond their present\r\nlimits, and had covered the plains at the foot of the Alps with a vast\r\nconfluent sheet of ice. Agassiz, in 1840, visited Scotland with Dean\r\nBuckland, and as the result of his observations had not hesitated to\r\ndeclare that Scotland also had been swathed in an ice-sheet. British\r\ngeologists, however, were slow to accept his conclusions, and the\r\nfavourite explanation of the “drifts” was that they had been laid down\r\nat the bottom of a sea in which icebergs floated, transporting great\r\nrock boulders from one place to another.\r\n\r\nIn 1866 the veteran geologist Charles Maclaren, then at the age of\r\neighty-four, published the second edition of his _Geology of Fife\r\nand the Lothians_, and in his account of the “alluvial phenomena” of\r\nthe district he shows the transitional state in which opinion then\r\nwas passing from the iceberg hypothesis to the land-ice hypothesis.\r\n“The dressed surfaces as well as the ‘Till’ or Diluvium [the lower\r\nboulder-clay] seem to have been mainly due to a great envelope of ice\r\nacting for ages; the newer alluvium, on the other hand [the upper\r\nboulder-clay], appears to have been chiefly due to icebergs and ocean\r\ncurrents. In thus attributing so much to the action of ice during\r\na long glacial period, it must ever be borne in mind that oceanic\r\ncurrents preceded this ice action, and that similar currents must have\r\nbeen in existence to transport the icebergs to which we ascribe the\r\nerratic blocks and boulders. Alternate submergence and elevation of\r\nthe north of Europe, combined with ice on land and ice on water (in my\r\nopinion), must satisfactorily explain these diluvial phenomena, which,\r\nas unsettled problems, are still engaging the attention of younger\r\ngeologists.”\r\n\r\nOne of the ablest champions of the land-ice hypothesis\r\nwas Robert Chambers, who was widely known as a historian and a member\r\nof the famous Edinburgh publishing firm. As early as 1852 he ranged\r\nhimself on the side of Agassiz, declaring that floating icebergs and\r\ncurrents of water could not possibly be accepted as a satisfactory\r\nexplanation of the boulder-clay and striated rock-surfaces. Mr T. F.\r\nJamieson of Ellon was making a very careful study of the drifts of\r\nAberdeenshire and the adjacent counties, and had little hesitation\r\nin accepting the theory of an extensive ice-sheet, covering these\r\ndistricts and filling up all the valleys, as the explanation most in\r\naccordance with the facts which he had observed. He admitted, however,\r\nthat subsequently there had been a great submergence during which many\r\nof the uppermost drift deposits had been laid down.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Lyell, whose authority on questions of theoretical geology\r\nat that time was paramount, was also willing to accept the former\r\nexistence of glaciers over very extensive regions of the British\r\nIsles, and described moraines that occur in the upland valleys of\r\nForfarshire, though he considered the drifts of the lower grounds as\r\nmainly at any rate deposited in cold seas in which icebergs floated.\r\nMuch more important than Lyell, or at least much more likely to exert\r\ninfluence on the mind of James Geikie at an early stage in his career,\r\nwas Sir Andrew Ramsay, then local Director of the Geological Survey.\r\nRamsay was a man after James Geikie’s own heart, and there can be no\r\ndoubt that his influence on Geikie was very great. We should not be\r\nfar wrong, in fact, in regarding Geikie as the direct successor of\r\nRamsay in the line of scientific thought. Through his whole life James\r\nGeikie hardly departed from the position taken up by Ramsay on glacial\r\ngeology, though of course he developed many new and important fields\r\nof investigation. There was a remarkable similarity in their outlook;\r\nthey both relied on very much the same class of evidence, depending\r\nspecially on field geology as a basis, but prepared to build up\r\nfar-reaching deductions from the facts they had observed. Most of the\r\ntheories enunciated by Ramsay were strongly and consistently maintained\r\nby James Geikie up to the close of his career. Ramsay also was more\r\nthan a glacialist. He left a deep mark in the study of physiography,\r\nthe origin and history of British scenery, and in structural geology;\r\nand in these subjects also James Geikie found continual inspiration.\r\n\r\nWhen Geikie joined the Survey, Ramsay was at the zenith of his powers.\r\nHe had been for twenty years an active field-geologist on the Survey\r\nstaff; had travelled very extensively over Great Britain on geological\r\nwork; was a well-known man in London scientific circles; and from\r\nhis official position had unrivalled opportunities of making himself\r\nacquainted with the field evidence bearing on all geological questions\r\nthen under review. He was endowed with great energy and a warm\r\nimagination; a genial and hearty comrade, very fond of a joke; well\r\nread in poetical and romantic literature; but withal a hard, untiring\r\nworker who never spared himself or any member of his staff where duty\r\nwas concerned. The two men were in many ways alike, and no doubt they\r\nwere very soon on terms of close friendship; and to the latest days of\r\nhis life James Geikie spoke of Ramsay with deep affection and respect.\r\n\r\nTo the influence of Ramsay we must add that of his brother. Archibald\r\nGeikie was already widely known for his geological work, and second\r\nonly to Ramsay as an authority on theoretical questions affecting\r\nBritish geology. He had been appointed to the staff of the Geological\r\nSurvey in 1855, six years before James Geikie, and had rapidly risen\r\ninto prominence. Although at first he had given his adhesion to the\r\niceberg theory, his views had changed under the influence of Ramsay,\r\nand in a classic paper which he read to the Geological Society of\r\nGlasgow in 1862 he had described the glacial deposits of Scotland in\r\nan exhaustive manner. This paper, so full in its details and so lucid\r\nand moderate in statement, produced a great impression, at any rate in\r\nScotland, and clearly marked out the way along which future progress\r\nwas to be made. Though Sir Archibald Geikie subsequently made few\r\ncontributions to glacial geology, deserting this field for the study of\r\nvolcanoes, and of other parts of physical and historical geology, he\r\ndid a very great service to science in so clearly defining his position\r\non a much debated subject by publishing this paper.\r\n\r\nAs time went on, some of the younger geologists who had joined the\r\nSurvey after James Geikie became enthusiastic workers at glacial\r\nscience, and came to earn a reputation only second to Geikie himself in\r\nthis department of geology. Of these, we may specially mention Dr John\r\nHorne and Dr Benjamin N. Peach, both of whom became eminent authorities\r\non the glacial geology of Scotland. In early years they were James\r\nGeikie’s most intimate friends; their observations were always at his\r\nservice, and their criticism and advice he greatly valued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n“THE GREAT ICE AGE” AND “PREHISTORIC EUROPE”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first edition of _The Great Ice Age_ was completed in manuscript\r\nin 1873, and in the previous year James Geikie had already published\r\na series of papers in the _Geological Magazine_ which clearly\r\noutlined his main conclusions. All the essential features which were\r\nto distinguish his life-work in this highly controversial field are\r\nalready recognisable in these papers. The principal characteristic\r\nof _The Great Ice Age_ is its literary ability, the power of lucidly\r\nexpounding intricate scientific theories and sketching the evidence\r\non which they rest in a manner which equally avoids prolixity and\r\nobscurity. Although, as we have shown, he was by no means the first to\r\nchampion the cause of land ice as against floating ice as the dominant\r\nfactor in the production of the drift, he was immediately accorded the\r\nplace of protagonist in this cause. In Scotland his views, at any rate\r\namong his colleagues on the Survey, were those generally accepted. In\r\nEngland also the Survey geologists were in agreement with him on most\r\nof the essential points, though the submergence hypothesis and the\r\nefficiency of floating icebergs were long held in esteem in the sister\r\nkingdom, and have not yet completely fallen into disrepute. In Germany,\r\nNorway, Sweden, Holland, and in North America there had as yet been no\r\ngeneral enlightenment on the real merits of this controversy. It may be\r\nnoted that in the first edition of his _Great Ice Age_, James Geikie\r\ndid not deny the fact that a great submergence accompanied the main\r\nglaciation of Britain. He accepted it indeed, though in later years he\r\nsaw reason to modify this opinion.\r\n\r\nThe efficiency of land ice to explain most of the puzzling features\r\nof the drifts was the main thesis which the book was written to\r\nuphold. But there were many subordinate problems which came up for\r\nconsideration. One of these is the amount of erosion which the\r\nice-sheets and glaciers had produced. In this James Geikie followed\r\nvery closely in the footsteps of Ramsay; on the origin of rock-basins,\r\nfjords, and sea lochs there is in fact practically complete agreement\r\nin their views. This is the more significant, because Ramsay was at\r\nthat time far ahead of educated geological opinion on these matters,\r\nand it is only quite recently that his views have received acceptance\r\nin some of the most influential geological circles.\r\n\r\nAnother burning question which fell to be considered was the evidence\r\nfor or against interglacial warm periods; a question which even at\r\nthe present time is almost as keenly debated as it was in 1874 when\r\n_The Great Ice Age_ was published. As years went past and successive\r\neditions of the book appeared, the battle of land ice _versus_ floating\r\nice may be said to have been definitely closed; and James Geikie’s name\r\nas an expounder of glacial geology came to be more and more closely\r\nassociated with his views on the glacial succession (the question, that\r\nis, whether there was only one epoch of glaciation, or several epochs\r\nseparated by periods in which the climate was much milder). On this\r\nsubject, as on glacial erosion, James Geikie took up his position very\r\nstrongly from the first and maintained it to the end.\r\n\r\nIn considering this branch of James Geikie’s scientific work we may\r\ntrace a considerable amount of influence exerted on his thought by\r\nJames Croll, one of the most remarkable geologists that Scotland\r\nhas produced. Croll was a man who started life in a very humble\r\nposition; he educated himself, and by sheer power of intellect and\r\ndogged perseverance he attained eminence in scientific work. He was\r\nat once a metaphysician and a physicist, but it is only with the\r\nlatter aspect of his teaching that we are here concerned. Though\r\nquite unschooled in mathematics he was daunted by no difficulties,\r\nand by laborious calculation he worked out intricate problems of\r\nastronomy; and the accuracy of his solutions was afterwards confirmed\r\nby professional mathematicians and astronomers. Croll saw at a very\r\nearly stage that to land ice must be ascribed practically the whole of\r\nthe glacial phenomena of Scotland. He inferred from a number of facts\r\nthat the North Sea had been filled with Scandinavian ice during the\r\nmaximum stages of glaciation, and he suggested lines of research to\r\nJames Geikie, John Horne, and Benjamin Peach that led to important\r\ncontributions to the literature of Scottish glacial geology. Croll\r\npondered long and deeply over the causes of the Ice Age and the origin\r\nof changes of climate in general, and the result was a series of\r\npapers in which he maintained that changes in the eccentricity of the\r\nearth’s orbit and the obliquity of the ecliptic, accompanied by other\r\nastronomical processes, might produce epochs of cold climate in one\r\nhemisphere with warmer conditions in the opposite hemisphere. These\r\nchanges might under certain conditions be sufficient to account for the\r\nexistence of ice-sheets. During the later years of his life Croll was\r\na member of the staff of the Geological Survey of Scotland, and this\r\nsilent, reserved, studious man was widely recognised as a most original\r\nthinker.\r\n\r\nJames Geikie was much attached to Croll, and while he never professed\r\nto be versed in the mathematical branches of science, he was prepared\r\nto accept the accuracy of Croll’s theories. The other causes of\r\nglaciation which had been advanced by various geologists, such as\r\nLyell’s hypothesis of elevation and depression of the land, he believed\r\nto be quite inadequate, and in the first edition of _The Great Ice Age_\r\nhe states Croll’s hypothesis with evident approval, or at any rate\r\nregards it as the only explanation at that time offered which could be\r\nheld to be at all in accordance with the facts.\r\n\r\nFrom this position Geikie never receded. In subsequent years Croll’s\r\nhypothesis was the subject of strenuous discussion. Eminent astronomers\r\nlike Sir Robert Ball found in it a satisfactory explanation of\r\nPleistocene glaciation. Equally eminent astronomers like Simon\r\nNewcomb after testing it found it wanting. The subject as a whole\r\nwas beyond the scope of Geikie’s work, which was geological rather\r\nthan astronomical or meteorological; and in his later years he rather\r\navoided the discussion of the causes of glaciation, but he made it\r\nclear that in his opinion, if Croll’s hypothesis failed, no other\r\nexplanation could be regarded as adequate.\r\n\r\nAs a corollary of Croll’s theory, it followed that there had been more\r\nthan one period of arctic cold in the northern hemisphere, and that\r\nintercalated between the cold periods there were epochs of warmer\r\nclimate--interglacial periods, as they are now called. The evidence\r\nfor the existence of interglacial periods had appealed to Geikie in\r\nhis field work, and he had become convinced that in Scotland there had\r\nbeen at least one interval of mild climatic conditions separating two\r\nepochs of glacial severity. This may have to some extent predisposed\r\nhim to favour Croll’s hypothesis as being in greatest accordance with\r\nthe geological facts. For it cannot be said that James Geikie was in a\r\nhurry to maintain the complexity of the Ice Age. In the first edition\r\nof his book, though much engrossed in the description of the beds\r\nintercalated with the boulder-clay and “till,” and obviously inclined\r\nto attribute great importance to them, he says very little about warm\r\ninterglacial periods, and the reader is not led to suppose that he\r\nconsiders the evidence as of overwhelming strength. Three years later\r\nthe second edition of _The Great Ice Age_ appeared, and we find that\r\nthe author then took up a much more definite position on this subject,\r\nand has made a great advance in his treatment of it. But already in\r\n1873 he was convinced in his own mind that several warm interglacial\r\nperiods had interrupted the rigours of the Ice Age, though he did not\r\nattempt to enumerate the interglacial epochs in detail, or to state\r\nfully the conclusions at which he had arrived.\r\n\r\nThe post-glacial history of Scotland was a subject that early attracted\r\nJames Geikie’s attention. He had devoted much study to it, and was in\r\nafter years to present a masterly analysis of its stages and sequence.\r\nTo trace the connection between the Ice Age and the present day, and\r\nto show the changes which had elapsed since the ice-sheets melted from\r\nthe surface of Britain, was to him one of the most alluring departments\r\nof geology. A good deal of work had been done by Scottish geologists\r\non the study of the raised beaches of Scotland, but no general account\r\nof their relation to one another and to the glacial boulder-clay and\r\nmoraines had appeared before the publication of the first edition of\r\n_The Great Ice Age_. That the sea-level had undergone alterations\r\naround our shores was sufficiently demonstrated by the raised beaches,\r\nof which three were very well known, the 100-foot, 50-foot, and 25-foot\r\nbeaches. But some authors, such as Chambers and Mackintosh, were ready\r\nto find raised beaches anywhere; gravel terraces at all elevations,\r\nmany of which are now known to have been the deposits of glacial rivers\r\nand lakes, and rock escarpments and platforms of very varied origin,\r\nwere appealed to as evidence of former submergence beneath the sea.\r\nProf. Geikie at this stage was not altogether free from a belief in\r\nthe great submergence, or at any rate he was not prepared to challenge\r\nits champions; but he knew how little value was to be attached to some\r\nof the evidence cited in its support, and his own studies had led him\r\nto a fuller understanding and a more satisfactory appreciation of the\r\nmeaning of the raised beaches and the light they threw on the varied\r\nconditions that had prevailed in Scotland during and subsequent to the\r\nmelting of the great ice-sheet. In particular, he maintained that the\r\nhigher beaches were associated with the deposits of clay containing\r\nglacial shells that were so well known through the researches of Smith\r\nof Jordanhill, and belonged to a time when glacial conditions had not\r\ncompletely ceased in Scotland. The 50-foot beach was associated with\r\nthe oldest relics of man in the midland valley of Scotland, while the\r\n25-foot beach and lower beaches were laid down in climatic surroundings\r\ndiffering little from those of the present day. Between the epochs of\r\ndepression which these sea-terraces recorded there had been intervals\r\nwhen the land stood at a higher level, so that the earth movements\r\nhad been of an oscillating character, and not merely a succession of\r\nuplifts with intervening pauses during which the beach-platforms were\r\nproduced. The buried forests and the peat-bogs furnished additional\r\nevidence of the elevation and depression of the land, and hinted, not\r\nobscurely, at the probability that changes of climate had also taken\r\nplace during post-glacial time, the warm continental epochs encouraging\r\nthe growth of trees, while the cold, damp, insular climates were\r\nfavourable to the accumulation of peat. Although these conclusions were\r\nonly sketched out and not fully stated, it is plain to the reader that\r\nalready Prof. Geikie had convinced himself of the importance of these\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\nAnd in considering what is probably the most controversial problem\r\nwhich the student of Pleistocene and recent times must investigate,\r\nnamely, the relation of prehistoric man to the glacial period, he\r\nfollowed the same line of thought, considering that the evidence of\r\nthe mammalian remains found in caves and river gravels of Northern\r\nEurope pointed to the conclusion that there had been great variations\r\nof climate. The mixture of northern and southern types of animals was\r\nnot to be ascribed in his opinion to migrations arising from seasonal\r\nchanges, but was due principally to alternations of cold and heat,\r\neach enduring for a considerable time. He advocated also the existence\r\nof man in glacial times, and recapitulating views already enumerated\r\nin some papers which he had published in the _Geological Magazine_,\r\nhe argued that the palæolithic gravels of England were to be regarded\r\nas glacial and preglacial, and not, as was widely believed, of\r\ninterglacial and post-glacial age.\r\n\r\nLastly, we may mention a feature of the first edition of _The Great\r\nIce Age_ that was to become more prominent in subsequent editions,\r\nthe comparative description of the phenomena described by geologists\r\nof many different countries. For information regarding England he was\r\nlargely indebted to his colleagues in the English Survey, principally\r\nGreen, Tiddeman, and Whitaker. The Swedish, German, Norwegian, and\r\ncontinental deposits generally had perforce to be described from the\r\nliterature of the subject, a literature already very extensive. Through\r\nhis whole life Prof. Geikie was a diligent student of the literature of\r\nhis subject. The most important European languages, as already noted in\r\nPart I., he could read with facility, and as he was in constant receipt\r\nof copies of glacial papers from their authors, much of his time was\r\ntaken up with a study of the contemporary literature of glaciation. It\r\nwas his familiarity with the work of other investigators in this field\r\nof scientific research that gave him his position as the representative\r\nBritish glacialist, and made his works so widely read and appreciated\r\nby foreign scientific men.\r\n\r\nWith the publication of the first edition of _The Great Ice Age_ in\r\n1874, Prof. Geikie’s reputation as a glacial geologist of the first\r\nrank was at once established. The book had a cordial reception and a\r\nready sale. Prof. Green wrote a long and very sympathetic review of\r\nit for _Nature_, and, whether its teachings were generally accepted\r\nor not, the author had the satisfactory proof that it had not been\r\nneglected by the rapid exhaustion of the first edition. Within a few\r\nmonths he had to set seriously about the production of a new and\r\nenlarged edition. Much of its popularity was no doubt due to the clear\r\nand graceful style in which it was written. The more abstruse parts of\r\nthe subject were not discussed with too much detail; great insistence\r\nwas placed on the field evidence, and the discussion was such as could\r\nbe followed by the general reader who had no special training in\r\ngeological work. A studied moderation marked the conclusions arrived\r\nat, and no attempt was made to force a revolutionary interpretation\r\nof glacial phenomena into prominence. A great deal also was due to\r\nthe fact that the book embodied not only its author’s work and the\r\nhypotheses he favoured, but also the results of the observations of\r\nmany of his colleagues on the Survey who had a very wide acquaintance\r\nwith field geology, and were, on the whole, very well agreed regarding\r\nthe interpretation of the facts. The author fully acknowledged his\r\nobligations to colleagues on the Survey staff, but at the same time\r\nit was clear that on this subject he was the leader and not merely a\r\ncompiler of other people’s results. The dedication to Sir Andrew Ramsay\r\nis especially significant, for from Ramsay more than from any other\r\ngeologist had inspiration been received.\r\n\r\nProbably the effect of the book was greater in foreign countries\r\nthan in Britain. In Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, and the United\r\nStates many geologists were actively prosecuting the study of\r\nglacial deposits, and so clear and authoritative a statement of the\r\nobservations and conclusions of the Scottish glacialists had much\r\ninterest to workers in other lands. This appreciation the author valued\r\ngreatly, and it was the cause of a great enlargement in the circle\r\nof his correspondents. He followed keenly the advance of glacial\r\ninvestigation in foreign countries, and especially the new evidence\r\nbrought forward regarding changes of climate during and subsequent to\r\nthe glacial period, and the early chapters in the history of man in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nThe second edition, which appeared three years after the first, showed\r\nthat the author had been led to modify his views in several important\r\nrespects. The great post-glacial submergence he now considered\r\nunproved, following in this the conclusions arrived at by Dr Jamieson\r\nof Ellon in his studies of the Scottish glacial deposits. He recognised\r\nalso that the shelly boulder-clay of many parts of Scotland, such as\r\nCaithness, Orkney, Shetland, Dumbartonshire, and Ayrshire, was best\r\nexplained on the lines suggested by Dr James Croll as the deposit of\r\nan ice-sheet that had invaded the land after travelling for a time\r\nover the sea bottom. In this we see the influence of Dr Peach and Dr\r\nHorne’s work on the glaciation of Caithness, Shetland and Orkney, and\r\nof Geikie’s own investigation of the glacial phenomena of the Outer\r\nHebrides. These changes of opinion were undoubtedly well considered,\r\nand have been supported by subsequent discoveries. He also took up a\r\nmuch bolder attitude on the question of interglacial deposits and the\r\nrelation of man to the Ice Age. While still relying to the full on the\r\nevidence cited from Scotland in the first edition of _The Great Ice\r\nAge_ in favour of the existence of more than one interglacial period,\r\nhe adduced the results of Skertchly’s work at Brandon as proving\r\nthat the palæolithic deposits of south-eastern England are in places\r\noverlain by genuine boulder-clay. More prominence was also given to\r\nthe continental evidence for interglacial periods, especially to that\r\nobtained in the Dürnten lignite of the north side of the Alps, and\r\nof the so-called Pliocene beds of Lombardy, which even in the first\r\nedition he had confidently claimed as being really interglacial.\r\n\r\nThe next important work from Prof. Geikie’s pen was _Prehistoric\r\nEurope_, published in 1881. He continued to keep abreast of the rapidly\r\nincreasing literature of his subject, and although the main lines of\r\nhis treatment of it required little modification, he was continually\r\nadding to his store of facts. _Prehistoric Europe_ did not receive\r\nthe same welcome as _The Great Ice Age_, and this could hardly be\r\nexpected. Geologists were by this time familiar with the author’s\r\nmain conclusions, and the book in some measure takes us over familiar\r\nground. But to the general reader it remains one of the most enjoyable\r\nof the author’s contributions to the literature of science.\r\n\r\nHaving already expounded in his previous works the essential phenomena\r\nof glaciation, he devotes this book especially to the consideration\r\nof many questions of subordinate importance, though in themselves\r\ndeserving of full consideration. The interglacial problem, of course,\r\ncomes up for treatment, but he has not much to say of it that is\r\nreally new to his readers. It is interesting to note, however, that\r\nless insistence is now laid on the Scottish evidence in favour of\r\ninterglacial periods, and the British evidence in general, and more is\r\nsaid of the interglacial beds of Germany, France, Italy, Switzerland,\r\nand other European countries. The feeling seems to have arisen in the\r\nauthor’s mind that much of the British evidence was not so strong as to\r\ncarry conviction, and the work of continental geologists was rapidly\r\nadding details of the highest significance to the store of accumulated\r\nobservations in favour of repeated glaciations of Northern Europe. We\r\nmay readily believe also that he felt it desirable to enforce on the\r\nminds of his readers the value of much recent research done by his\r\nfellow-scientists in other countries. Many British geologists assumed\r\nand still maintain a very sceptical attitude regarding the value of\r\nthe British evidence for interglacial periods, and Prof. Geikie was\r\nundoubtedly right in appealing rather to well-established facts in\r\nadjacent countries than attempting to discuss the minutiæ of sections\r\noften of a temporary nature and by no means well-exposed, which were\r\nfamiliar to many of his British readers. It is not to be supposed,\r\nhowever, that he had changed his ground; to the last he maintained the\r\nvalidity of the British evidence for interglacial periods, though in\r\nsome parts of it modifications of his original statements might have\r\nbecome necessary. In the nature of things the evidence collected from\r\nso small an area as Scotland was sure to be incomplete, and to treat\r\nGreat Britain as a region apart was more likely to lead to error than\r\nto correct results.\r\n\r\nAnother subject which he handled more fully than in _The Great Ice Age_\r\nwas the antiquity of the human relics of palæolithic type which had\r\nbeen found in caves and river gravels. Many British geologists of the\r\nhighest reputation held that these were of post-glacial date, but Prof.\r\nGeikie had always contended strongly that some at least of the deposits\r\ncontaining the implements of early man were interglacial or preglacial.\r\nTime has justified his sagacity, and it is now fairly widely recognised\r\nthat these relics date back in some cases to periods anterior at any\r\nrate to the last glaciation of Northern Europe. The old controversy\r\nregarding changes of climate in Pleistocene time reappears in this\r\nvolume, and the author stoutly maintains the position he had taken up\r\nin _The Great Ice Age_, that the association of the remains of mammals\r\nof southern and northern types in gravel deposits can be explained only\r\non the hypothesis that periods of genial alternated with periods of\r\narctic climate.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the main purpose of this book, as seems to be indicated by\r\nthe title selected for it, was to discuss the changes that had taken\r\nplace in Europe since the melting of the ice of the last stage of the\r\nglacial period. The phenomena of the raised beaches that encircle\r\nour Scottish coasts, with the alluvial or “carse” clays of the river\r\nvalleys intimately associated with the beach deposits, and the peat\r\nand buried forests of our moorlands and coasts, had fascinated Prof.\r\nGeikie since the beginning of his glacial investigations, and he felt\r\nthat for their proper discussion more scope was required than was\r\nafforded by such a book as _The Great Ice Age_. These problems were\r\nfull of difficulties and the evidence appeared often contradictory\r\nor misleading, but he managed to piece it together and to arrive at\r\na consistent and clearly reasoned interpretation. The raised beaches\r\nindicate, of course, changes of the level of sea and land; but these\r\nwere far more considerable than the beaches alone would indicate, as\r\nthe submerged forests that in many places are intercalated with the\r\nbeach and carse deposits show that at certain stages the land area\r\nhad been far more extensive than at present. This was confirmed by\r\nmany facts regarding the present distribution of animals and plants in\r\nthe British Isles which could not otherwise be logically explained;\r\nand in this field of investigation he gratefully acknowledges the\r\nassistance furnished by his old friend Dr Buchanan White, with whom\r\nhe was in close contact since he was then living in Perth. The raised\r\nbeaches also were associated with the closing phases of glaciation\r\nin Britain, since both the 100-foot and the 50-foot beaches in the\r\nnorth of Scotland showed effects of contemporaneous glacial action,\r\nand the older marine shell beds contained shells now living only in\r\nArctic seas. The interpretation of the evidence to be obtained from the\r\nstudy of peat-bogs and buried forests was by no means so clear, but\r\nindubitably pointed towards the recurrence of damp cold epochs suitable\r\nfor the rapid growth of peat, separated by epochs of a different\r\ncharacter during which the country was overspread by a dense growth\r\nof forest. These hypotheses had long occupied the author’s mind, and\r\nhe had pondered deeply over the evidence in support of them. Fuller\r\ninvestigation in future years was destined to bring out many striking\r\nconfirmations of his opinions. It may be said that so far as his\r\ninterpretation of the post-glacial history of Scotland is concerned,\r\nthe most authoritative opinion of Scottish geologists at the present\r\ntime is in accordance with the conclusions which he had arrived at.\r\nThis alone makes the book still worth careful study by those who would\r\nappreciate the changes our islands have undergone in the most recent\r\nstages of their geological history, and though notable additions have\r\nbeen made to the store of accumulated observations, they readily find a\r\nplace in the scheme which he has outlined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nEDUCATIONAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE WORK\r\n\r\n\r\nWith his appointment in 1882 to the Murchison Chair of Geology and\r\nMineralogy in Edinburgh University to succeed his brother Sir Archibald\r\nGeikie, a new epoch began in James Geikie’s career. For some years\r\nhe had been District Surveyor on the Scottish Survey, a post of\r\nconsiderable responsibility, and requiring the exercise of tact and\r\nfirmness, but one which presented most valuable opportunities to a\r\nkeen geologist. The Scottish Survey at that time had an exceptionally\r\nstrong personnel, and in pure field geology was setting a standard of\r\nexcellence which has rarely been surpassed. Several of his colleagues\r\ncame to be recognised in the course of a few years as scientific men\r\nof the highest distinction, and among them there was a spirit of\r\ncamaraderie and of friendly emulation in research which made their\r\ndaily tasks a constant source of novelty and of unflagging interest.\r\nTo many of his colleagues, such as Peach, Horne, Jack, Croll, Skae,\r\nand Irvine, James Geikie had been indebted for important information\r\nand for the most searching criticism, combined with unselfish\r\nappreciation of the value of his work. The ground surveyed had most\r\nof it been previously examined only in a quite unexhaustive way,\r\nand had consequently the attraction of novelty; it was also of very\r\nvaried structure, and, more important from his point of view, it was\r\nrich in evidence of glacial action. No better training ground for\r\na field-geologist who intended to devote himself to the study of\r\nglaciation could well be imagined.\r\n\r\nAmong the Scottish geological staff James Geikie’s position as a\r\nfield-geologist and as a glacialist was fully recognised, and he had\r\nthe unquestioning support of his colleagues. His life was full of\r\nvariety and interest. No doubt, like other men, he had made mistakes\r\nand had been severely handled by some of his critics. Some of his early\r\nwork on the Silurian volcanic rocks of Ayrshire, for example, had\r\nsuffered greatly from his insufficient knowledge of the chemical and\r\nmineralogical foundations on which geology rests.\r\n\r\nProbably this criticism taught him to be more careful in speculation\r\nand more critical in accepting evidence. But his field work, as a\r\nwhole, was of the highest standard. His field maps of Carboniferous and\r\nDevonian ground proved to be exceptionally thorough and accurate. In\r\nthese early years, of course, it was not intended to execute a survey\r\non a very minute scale. The large area upon which each surveyor was\r\nexpected to report each year prevented him from spending more than a\r\nlimited time on a small district. Moreover, the literature of the\r\ngeology of Scotland was as yet by no means large. Many of the more\r\nspecialised branches of geology, such as petrology, were as yet in a\r\nvery rudimentary state. Perhaps on that account the field-geologist was\r\nexpected to be more of an all-round geologist, and to rely less on the\r\nguidance of specialists than his successors at the present time.\r\n\r\nThe opportunities presented to him he had made use of to the fullest.\r\nHe was a born observer. The retentiveness of his memory for localities\r\nand for geological details was extraordinary; but that he did not\r\ntrust to it exclusively his well-filled note-books bear witness. What\r\ndistinguished him specially, however, was his power of maintaining\r\nhis interest in the abstract questions of geology and the indomitable\r\nperseverance and industry with which he pursued his researches in\r\nspite of the distractions of field work. Not many geologists after an\r\narduous day in the open air could sit down, as was his habit, and spend\r\nmany hours in literary work, or in the task of mastering the papers,\r\nin many foreign languages, in which the progress of glacial geology\r\nwas recorded. Even admitting that he was a ready writer, we must\r\nacknowledge that his power of work at this time was enormous, and we\r\ncannot wonder that at times he felt on the verge of a breakdown.\r\n\r\nThe testimonials which he had printed when making application for\r\nthe Professorship of Geology in Edinburgh show how thoroughly his\r\nreputation as a scientist was established in Europe and America. His\r\nbook on _The Great Ice Age_ receives high praise from Norwegian,\r\nSwedish, Swiss, German, Italian, and American geologists, and among his\r\nBritish supporters he could number Darwin, Evans, and Hooker.\r\n\r\nIt was not, as already seen, without reluctance that James Geikie\r\ndecided to leave the Geological Survey. The earnest scientific\r\nspirit in which its work was conducted, the intimate fellowship with\r\nscientific men of kindred spirit, and the free open-air life had great\r\nattractions for him. The academic life was new to him, and must have\r\nseemed at first a cabined and cribbed existence compared with that of\r\na field-geologist. Yet there is no doubt the choice was a wise one. In\r\nthe higher departments of Survey work his duties would have been mostly\r\nof an administrative nature, and much of his time would have been taken\r\nup by routine business, very largely of a non-geological character,\r\nwhich would certainly have proved uncongenial. His opportunities of\r\nvisiting the field would also have been much curtailed. Residing in\r\nEdinburgh, he could keep in intimate touch with his former colleagues\r\nof the Survey, and glean the most valuable results of their work\r\nwhen they returned to the office each year. They were now beginning\r\nthe survey of the North and West Highlands, and were to undertake\r\ninvestigations of a kind with which he was quite unacquainted. A good\r\ndeal of new information on glacial geology was being collected by them\r\nyear by year, and of course communicated to him regularly. But the\r\nmain work in hand was the unravelling of the intricate history of the\r\nHighlands and the palæontology and petrology of the older rocks of\r\nScotland. This was destined to yield most brilliant results, and the\r\nScottish Survey was to become more famous even than it had been in the\r\ndays of Sir Andrew Ramsay; but these fields of investigation were not\r\nthose which he had chosen for his own especial study, and there can be\r\nno doubt that as a university professor, with ample time for research\r\nin any branch of his subject which appealed to him, he was able to\r\nfollow out his own line of work far more untrammelled than he would\r\nhave been as an officer of the Geological Survey.\r\n\r\nTo the execution of the duties of his Chair he devoted himself with\r\ncharacteristic thoroughness and energy. His brother had combined\r\nthe office of Director of the Geological Survey of Scotland with\r\nthe Murchison Professorship, but James Geikie was free to give his\r\nwhole time to university work. At first, at any rate, he had little\r\nspare time on his hands. Well versed in Scottish geology and in the\r\nphysical and structural divisions of the science, he had also a wide\r\nknowledge of stratigraphical geology and of the geological structure of\r\nEurope and North America. He worked hard to increase his knowledge of\r\nmineralogy, petrology, and palæontology, even setting up a laboratory\r\nto carry out mineral assays. Ever a skilful draughtsman, he prepared\r\nwith his own hand many drawings of landscapes, geological sections,\r\nand the microscopic structure of rocks. He was always rather averse\r\nto the use of the lantern to illustrate his lectures, and preferred\r\nlarge wall diagrams, many of which had cost great pains to make. From\r\nevery available source he collected specimens of rocks, minerals,\r\nand fossils. He was unsparing in his efforts to make his subject as\r\ninteresting to his students as possible, and to relieve them of the\r\ntedious work of taking voluminous manuscript notes. For this purpose he\r\nprepared long series of memoranda, and had copies of them struck off by\r\na primitive duplicating apparatus.\r\n\r\nAs a lecturer he had rather an easy-going, colloquial style, which\r\nundoubtedly had the merit of catching and holding the attention of\r\neven the least intellectual of his audience. He spoke fast, and\r\ncovered a very large part of his subject in the course of the one\r\nhundred lectures which constituted the work of the winter class, but\r\nby the help of the memoranda above mentioned his students had little\r\ndifficulty in keeping abreast of his progress. Brimful of humour and of\r\nfun, he was not above making an occasional joke to his audience; but\r\nthis aspect of his character was far more in evidence on his Saturday\r\nexcursions. However long the walk and however unpropitious the weather,\r\nthere was always a circle of admiring students around him, intent\r\non catching every detail of the amusing stories, reminiscences, and\r\nsnatches of old ballads or songs, of which he had an unfailing supply.\r\nFrom the first he proved a very successful professor. His course was\r\nat that time optional, in the sense that candidates for the recognised\r\ndegrees of the University did not require to take it. Only students\r\ndesirous of studying geology for its own sake were to be found on the\r\nbenches of his class-room. He had always also a fair number of men who\r\nwere not regular students but engaged in professional work, who desired\r\nto widen the range of their intellectual vision, and took an occasional\r\nclass at the University. Many of these were teachers occupied all day\r\nin the schools of the city; and to meet the needs of such men he fixed\r\nhis hour for lecturing at four o’clock in the afternoon, so as to\r\ngive them a chance of attending after their day’s work. Many of these\r\nstudents afterwards became his attached personal friends, and in this\r\ngroup were included missionaries home on leave, army men, journalists,\r\ndoctors taking postgraduate courses at the University, and planters and\r\nmining engineers enjoying a long holiday at home after years spent in\r\nforeign countries.\r\n\r\nAt first he conducted all the classes himself, but after a time the\r\nUniversity granted him an assistant, and he started a regular practical\r\nor laboratory course. His relations with his assistants were of the\r\nmost sympathetic character. Always ready to take more than his fair\r\nshare of the drudgery of elementary teaching, he showed the most kindly\r\ninterest in the progress of his assistants, and encouraged them to\r\ncarry out original research on their own account. His fine library\r\nand wide knowledge of the literature of geology were always at their\r\nservice, and as the University in those days was by no means liberally\r\nendowed with funds for the purchase of scientific apparatus, he often\r\nprovided at his own expense the instruments necessary for special\r\nresearches. The rooms assigned to the geological department were\r\nmiserably inadequate--dark, half-furnished attics, draughty, cold, and\r\nuncomfortable--but much good work was done there.\r\n\r\nJames Geikie lived to see the conditions of university teaching in\r\nEdinburgh greatly altered for the better. The courses qualifying for\r\ndegrees were made much less restricted, and geology became a subject\r\nin the curriculum for the Arts as well as the Science degree. The\r\nnumber of students increased, and the status of the Chair was improved.\r\nBetter-paid assistants were provided, increased grants for the purchase\r\nof apparatus, and a higher stipend for the professor. A very important\r\naddition to the department was the provision of a library of geological\r\nbooks, the gift of Sir Archibald Geikie and James Geikie in the first\r\nplace, subsequently taken over and maintained by the University\r\nLibrary authorities. The prestige of geology in the University and the\r\ncondition of the department in 1914 when he resigned were incomparably\r\nsuperior to those which existed in 1882 when he was appointed to the\r\nChair.\r\n\r\nIn 1894 he became Dean of the Faculty of Science in the University, and\r\ncontinued to hold this responsible appointment till a year before his\r\nretiral. Although he did not by any means suffer fools gladly, he had\r\nmuch sympathy with students and with his colleagues, the professors,\r\nlecturers, and assistants, in the difficulties which they encountered\r\nin their work, and he had good business faculties, being careful,\r\nprompt, and industrious. The great esteem in which he was held by all\r\nwho came in contact with him was clearly proved by his long tenure\r\nof this exacting post, and his success in smoothing the difficulties\r\ninevitable in university life where so many interests have to be\r\nconsidered. The time required for this work he gave ungrudgingly;\r\nbut as he was at the same time Honorary Editor of the Royal Scottish\r\nGeographical Society’s _Magazine_, and eventually President of that\r\nSociety, and served on the Council of the Royal Society of Edinburgh\r\nfor many years, he felt that his time for research and literary work\r\nwas very seriously curtailed.\r\n\r\nIf we consult the list of Prof. Geikie’s contributions to scientific\r\nliterature which appears as an appendix to this volume, it becomes\r\nevident that with his appointment to the Edinburgh professorship he\r\nbegan to write on several topics which previously had not specially\r\nengaged his attention. The voluminous notes from which his lectures\r\nwere delivered were abridged, rearranged, and ultimately published\r\nas his _Outlines of Geology_. This work was expressly meant for the\r\nuse of his own students, and served to relieve them of a large part\r\nof the tedious note-taking which was in those days a heavy burden on\r\nmembers of the University classes. It found acceptance, however, in a\r\nwider circle, and in time three large editions of the book were sold.\r\nIts most distinctive feature is the ample space devoted to physical\r\ngeology, especially the processes at work to-day which throw light on\r\nthe structures and origin of rocks. The more technical portions of the\r\nsubject, such as petrology and palæontology, he considers in much\r\nless detail. In fact, the book is quite as suitable for the general\r\nreader as for the university student. This book appeared in 1888,\r\nand seventeen years later his second and most successful text-book\r\nwas published, the _Structural and Field Geology for Students_. His\r\nnatural abilities as an observer, and his thorough training as a\r\nfield-geologist, made him especially competent to handle this subject\r\neffectively, and he made judicious use of photographs taken by the\r\nGeological Survey to illustrate the volume. The success of the book\r\nwas also in large measure due to his long experience as a teacher and\r\nhis clear and easy style; in fact, the foundations of the text-book\r\nwere laid in the courses of lectures on structural geology which he\r\nused to deliver in the summer sessions. Something also, no doubt, was\r\ndue to there being no really good work on this subject for English\r\nand American students. He was much gratified by its success, for he\r\nfelt that he had done something to stimulate accurate field surveying\r\nby students of geology, and field work he always considered the most\r\neducative part of geological training.\r\n\r\nHere we may mention also his contributions to _Chambers’s\r\nEncyclopædia_, for which he wrote many of the geological articles.\r\nIn 1875 he had prepared a small Elementary Manual for the well-known\r\nEdinburgh firm of publishers, and as successive editions of the\r\n_Encyclopædia_ were printed he continued to revise his geological\r\narticles, so that he had a continuous connection with Messrs Chambers\r\nlasting over forty years.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHis work as a geographer next claims our attention. The fields of\r\ngeological research which he especially cultivated have a very close\r\nconnection with geographical science. In the Scottish Geographical\r\nSociety, as already stated, he took a deep interest from the start.\r\nFor many years his face was a familiar one on the platform at the\r\nlectures delivered by eminent geographers and distinguished travellers\r\nin Edinburgh, and as these lectures are always very well attended,\r\nprobably his connection with the Society made him better known to\r\nthe general public than any other of his numerous activities. These\r\nfunctions also brought him into contact with many explorers and\r\nscientists who came to Edinburgh to lecture, and were the source of\r\nmany friendships which he valued highly. During the latter years of his\r\nlife the Geographical Society claimed almost as much of his attention\r\nas his academic duties, and as he was fortunately assisted by very\r\ncompetent lecturers in the University, he could spare the time required\r\nto fulfil both functions.\r\n\r\nHis studies in geography were always in those fields which form\r\nthe border-land between geology and geography. The history of the\r\ndevelopment of scenery and of earth-forms in general, and the relation\r\nbetween geological structure and geographical configuration, were\r\nfavourite subjects for his pen. In this he was a true follower of\r\nPlayfair. He delighted also to prepare short notices for the Society’s\r\nmagazine, describing the results of recent work on prehistoric man, on\r\nchanges of climate in recent geological periods, and the action of ice\r\nin the production of surface features. The magazine proved a useful\r\nvehicle for conveying to the public the results of his wide reading\r\non topics such as these. Many of the articles which first appeared in\r\nits pages were subsequently issued in book form, or were used in the\r\npreparation of the third edition of _The Great Ice Age_, and the other\r\nscientific treatises which he produced.\r\n\r\nIn 1893 he collected the most important and interesting of his\r\nscientific lectures and addresses into a volume to which he gave the\r\ntitle _Fragments of Earth Lore_. The book was published by his friend\r\nDr Bartholomew of the Edinburgh Geographical Institute, and served to\r\nintroduce the results of some of his researches to a wider circle of\r\nreaders than they would otherwise have reached, as they had originally\r\nappeared in publications as widely different in purpose as _Good\r\nWords_ and the _Transactions of the Geological Society of Edinburgh_.\r\nMost of the papers, as was to be expected, treat of the progress of\r\nglacial geology, and one of these is of special importance. It is\r\nentitled “The Glacial Succession in Europe,” and was reprinted from the\r\n_Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh_. It shows considerable\r\nprogress along the lines which his work on glacial and interglacial\r\nperiods had previously followed, and was the precursor of the third\r\nedition of _The Great Ice Age_, in which the new developments of this\r\nbranch of science were to be more fully expounded. Among the other\r\npapers are several which are excellent popular scientific articles,\r\nsuch as the sketch of the “Geology of the Cheviot Hills,” originally\r\nissued in _Good Words_ in 1876. These essays show him at his best as\r\nan exponent of the simpler and more attractive themes of geological\r\nliterature. He had an easy, fluent style, and had he chosen to do so,\r\nmight have attained great popularity as an exponent of science for the\r\nmillion. The fine illustrations of this book deserve special mention,\r\nespecially the maps, which owe much to the skill and artistic taste\r\nof Dr Bartholomew, who in this matter had the cordial support and\r\nco-operation of Prof. Geikie. Ever since his days on the Geological\r\nSurvey he had set a very high standard in the preparation of maps, and\r\npaid the greatest attention to their artistic qualities as well as to\r\ntheir excellence as scientific documents.\r\n\r\nHis book on _Earth Sculpture_ followed in 1898, and in this particular\r\nfield soon came to be recognised as a standard work. It was published\r\nas one of a series, and the limitations of space probably did not\r\nallow very complete discussion of so large a subject: in fact, it is\r\nonly a sketch of the relations between geology and surface features;\r\nbut the subject was one for which he had a great liking, and he dwelt\r\non it lovingly in the lectures which he delivered each winter to the\r\nUniversity students. In this, of course, he followed the Scottish\r\ntradition, which since the days of Hutton and Playfair had assigned\r\nto this branch of geology a special importance. The writing of this\r\nlittle book accordingly was a real pleasure to him, and he drew nearly\r\nall the illustrations for it with his own hand, feeling that the only\r\ndifficulty was to keep himself within the limits which necessity\r\nimposed. His immense knowledge of geographical literature supplied him\r\nwith abundant material to illustrate the operation of natural agents in\r\ngiving rise to modifications of topographical form, and the change of\r\nsubject-matter from the always more or less controversial questions of\r\nthe glacial history of the northern hemisphere afforded stimulus to his\r\npen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nINTERGLACIAL CONTROVERSIES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second edition of _The Great Ice Age_ was sold out about the\r\nyear 1892, and the author set himself to the task of preparing a\r\nthird edition, incorporating all the most recent investigations. The\r\ntask was necessarily a very severe one, as an enormous increase had\r\ntaken place in the number of workers in this field, and the evidence\r\nhad accumulated at a very rapid rate. Prof. Geikie always regarded\r\nthis work as his principal contribution to geological literature, an\r\nopinion which most of his critics seem to have shared; and certainly\r\nthe labour he spent on the third edition of his _magnum opus_ was\r\nsufficient to entitle it to a high place in the history of glacial\r\ninvestigation. With indomitable perseverance he undertook the work\r\nof mastering the literature, and the number of papers he read may be\r\ninferred from the fact that his collection of pleistocene and glacial\r\npamphlets, which now form a part of the noble library of the University\r\nof Edinburgh, numbered over one hundred and sixty volumes. He aimed at\r\nmaking the book not only a compendium of information on the subject\r\nof which it treated, but also a critical review of the conclusions\r\nwhich might fairly be drawn from the evidence to hand; and in this he\r\nnot unfrequently differed from the authors of the papers he cited, a\r\nproceeding which was likely to awaken feelings the reverse of grateful.\r\n\r\nThe subject-matter was now, of course, so vastly enlarged that only\r\nthe more important contributions could be adequately noticed, and\r\nmuch interesting detail had to be passed over or handled only in the\r\nbriefest way. Many of the old controversies which had bulked largely\r\nin the first and second editions of the book had been decided, or had\r\nbeen so fully discussed that there was no pressing need to devote\r\nmuch space to them; but the subject as a whole was not less involved\r\nin uncertainty and debate, for new topics of discussion had arisen,\r\nhardly less keenly disputed than the old ones. In the main lines of his\r\nargument Prof. Geikie still followed the teaching of Ramsay and Croll\r\nand the geologists of the old Scottish school, and though, for example,\r\nno longer inculcating the necessity of a great glacial subsidence, he\r\nmaintained most of the positions he had taken up in his early days.\r\nIn one respect, however, the work marked a great advance, for he now\r\nbelieved it possible to subdivide the history of _The Great Ice Age_\r\ninto a succession of glacial and interglacial periods with far more\r\nminute detail than he had hitherto attempted. In this he showed a\r\nboldness which some critics might call rash, but which has been in\r\nvery large measure justified by the results of subsequent research. He\r\ncame to be recognised as pre-eminently the defender of interglacial\r\nperiods; and to this aspect of the book far more attention has been\r\ndirected than to any other. James Geikie, in fact, was soon considered\r\nan ultra-interglacialist, if we may coin a ponderous but perhaps\r\nexpressive term. The technical details of the evidence cannot be\r\ndiscussed in this place; it will be sufficient to say that he believed\r\nthere was good evidence in Scotland and in Europe generally for the\r\nformer existence of no less than six glacial periods separated by\r\nintervals of milder climate which were truly interglacial.\r\n\r\nAt the time the book was published it is no exaggeration to say that\r\nhe was alone in holding these views. Glacial investigation had made\r\nconsiderable progress in Scotland since 1877, when the second edition\r\nof his book was issued; but most Scottish geologists, though in\r\nagreement with Prof. Geikie on many points, would hardly have followed\r\nhim in the extreme position which he took up. That interglacial periods\r\nhad existed they generally admitted, but the searching criticism to\r\nwhich the evidence in favour of them had been subjected had revealed\r\nthat much of it was of an indecisive character, if not actually\r\nuntrustworthy; and no British geologists of that time had Prof.\r\nGeikie’s wide knowledge of the glacial literature of other countries.\r\nThey were consequently often unable to appreciate how far the\r\ncontinental evidence filled up the gaps which were painfully evident in\r\nthe record of British glacial history. In certain circles, in England\r\nespecially, the evidence for interglacial periods was regarded with\r\nsceptical distrust, if not completely disbelieved; but on Clement\r\nReid, his former colleague on the Survey, and one of the most skilled\r\nand critical glacialists then living, it had produced a different\r\nimpression. He saw clearly the necessity for admitting the existence of\r\nat least one interglacial period; but between his position and that of\r\nJames Geikie, who believed in five interglacial periods, a great gulf\r\nintervened. Perfectly aware of his apparent isolation, and supremely\r\nconfident in the accuracy of his results, James Geikie pressed\r\nstrongly on his readers the necessity of appreciating more fully the\r\nsignificance of the facts, and in consequence his book became very\r\nobviously an argument in favour of Pleistocene and Recent oscillations\r\nof climate rather than a critical and impartial review of the evidence\r\navailable. In every case he went as far in support of his conclusions\r\nas the facts in his opinion could be interpreted to lead; and the\r\ntreatment of British glacial questions showed undoubtedly a stubborn\r\ncourage and a determination to make the best of his case, which only\r\nhis confidence in the general sufficiency of the evidence for the whole\r\nof Europe could be held to justify.\r\n\r\nIn foreign countries generally he found more support, though\r\neverywhere, it may be admitted, his views must have been regarded as\r\nextreme. In Germany glacial investigation was still in a comparatively\r\nbackward state, but in Penck, Brückner, and Partsch (names subsequently\r\nto figure most prominently in the story of the advance of this\r\ndepartment of science) he found disciples and supporters of the\r\nhighest value. The investigations of these geologists had led them\r\nindependently to the belief in the repeated glaciation of the Alps\r\nand the mountains of Central and Eastern Europe. Their chief results\r\nwere still to appear, but enough was known of their conclusions to\r\ndefine their attitude. In Norway and Sweden, though many notable\r\ninvestigations into glacial geology had been made, no general consensus\r\nof opinion had been reached as to the stages into which the glacial\r\nhistory of that country must be subdivided, and Prof. Geikie still\r\nfound his old friend Axel Blytt the nearest in agreement with his\r\nviews among the Scandinavian geologists. In France the existence\r\nof interglacial periods had warm defenders and keen opponents; but\r\nattention was being directed more particularly to the successive phases\r\nof palæolithic culture, in the study of which French geologists and\r\nanthropologists have always been in the forefront. But in America a\r\nschool of geologists had arisen in which Prof. James Geikie had found\r\nnot only warm personal friends but also powerful supporters in his\r\ntheoretical views, and a most notable contribution to the third edition\r\nof _The Great Ice Age_ are the chapters by Prof. Chamberlin (_cf._ Part\r\nI., p. 120), in which the glacial history of North America is reviewed.\r\nThe literature of the glacial geology of that continent has now swelled\r\nto enormous dimensions, and to describe the phenomena in a critical\r\nand discriminative manner was beyond the powers of anyone who had not\r\ndevoted many years to a personal examination of the evidence; but\r\nin Prof. Chamberlin an exponent was secured who was not only in very\r\nsubstantial agreement with Prof. Geikie in his conclusions, but was\r\nalso exceptionally familiar with the facts.\r\n\r\nThe general reception of Prof. Geikie’s book was deferential if\r\nnot enthusiastic. The masterly handling of the subject was freely\r\nadmitted, and the thorough and scholarly manner in which the sources\r\nof information had been searched; but no symptoms appeared to indicate\r\nthe existence of a school of advanced interglacialists, in Britain\r\nat any rate, prepared to accept and defend the author’s theoretical\r\nviews. In fact, for a time it almost seemed as if the belief in the\r\nreality of interglacial periods, or at least in their importance, was\r\nless prevalent than it had been fifteen years before. A very large\r\nbody of geologists declined to regard the evidence on which Prof.\r\nGeikie and his supporters relied as having real value or significance.\r\nThere were still a few supporters of the theory of the marine origin\r\nof boulder-clay, and even some who were prepared to advocate the\r\nagency of floods and debacles as the prime factors in the formation\r\nof boulder-clay; and their views for some years were prominent in\r\nthe discussion of the origin of glacial deposits. The majority of\r\nexperienced geologists certainly did not accept these explanations;\r\nbut they were equally unwilling to concede that the Ice Age could be\r\nsubdivided into six glacial epochs, alternating with warmer climates\r\nin which Northern Europe and America had been occupied by a fauna and\r\nflora of temperate facies.\r\n\r\nProf. Geikie lived to see very considerable changes in the opinion\r\nof geologists on these matters. As time went on much new evidence\r\naccumulated to prove that great fluctuations of climate had marked\r\nthe recent stages of the earth’s history. From many sides facts were\r\nreported which tended to support his theories. Gradually it came to\r\nbe recognised that the ice margin must have withdrawn at times for\r\nconsiderable distances, leaving bare wide tracts of country which\r\nbecame populated by animals and plants. Still, however, it was\r\ncontended that these were mere episodes of no great account, temporary\r\nretreats and advances of the ice-sheets, unworthy to be designated\r\nglacial and interglacial periods. But the increase of knowledge renders\r\nthis position less and less tenable as years go by, and it may fairly\r\nbe claimed that before Prof. Geikie’s death, in most countries of\r\nEurope and North America the existence of several interglacial periods\r\nwas freely conceded by a majority of those who were competent to\r\nexpress an opinion on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe important new evidence brought to light was not wholly the result\r\nof geological investigation, though much of it was strictly of the\r\nkind to which Prof. Geikie had appealed. Most striking perhaps were\r\nthe descriptions of the glacial phenomena of the Alpine valleys which\r\nProfs. Penck and Brückner published in a famous volume in 1909. This\r\nwork was most appropriately dedicated by the authors to Prof. James\r\nGeikie. It is probably the most notable contribution to the literature\r\nof glacial geology in the last twenty years, and although it has not\r\nescaped criticism, it has produced in the minds of impartial readers a\r\nfirm conviction of the occurrence of glacial and interglacial periods\r\nso far as that part of Europe is concerned. Prof. Geikie was familiar\r\nwith some of the evidence from the Alpine chain when he was writing\r\nthe third edition of _The Great Ice Age_; some of the facts had led\r\ngeologists to postulate the existence of interglacial periods as long\r\nago as the middle of last century; but he watched with great pleasure\r\nthe gradual accumulation of observations added to previous knowledge\r\nby Penck and Brückner, and for many years he maintained an active\r\ncorrespondence with these investigators. In America, also, the opinion\r\nwas gradually gaining strength that the Ice Age was marked by several\r\nprolonged intervals of warmer conditions; and in France, Germany,\r\nand Scandinavia many geologists were added to the ranks of those who\r\nmaintained the importance of interglacial periods.\r\n\r\nHardly less convincing than the results of Penck and Brückner’s\r\ninvestigations into the repeated glaciation of the Alps were the\r\nadvances which have been made by the study of palæolithic deposits,\r\nespecially in France, Belgium, and Germany, during the last twenty\r\nyears. In popular interest this chapter of geological history\r\nnecessarily surpasses all others, and the study of the deposits of\r\nthe caverns and river valleys which contain the rude stone weapons\r\nof early man and the remains of the wild animals which he hunted has\r\nnever lacked enthusiastic investigators. In particular, the geologists\r\nand anthropologists of France have distinguished themselves by their\r\npatience and success in this department; and the palæolithic history\r\nof Europe is now far more fully known than it was in 1895. These\r\ninvestigations have shown not only that man inhabited Northern Europe\r\nbefore the cold conditions of the glacial period had passed away, as\r\nProf. Geikie had stoutly maintained from an early period in his career,\r\nbut also that cold epochs had alternated repeatedly with warmer epochs.\r\nDifferences of opinion, of course, there are, as is inevitable in\r\nsubjects which at the present time have been so incompletely examined.\r\nPenck and Geikie, for example, would place the epoch of weapons of\r\nAcheulian type in the second interglacial warm period, while Boule\r\nand Schmidt would relegate it to the third; but the significant fact\r\nremains that there is a general agreement that since man inhabited\r\nNorthern Europe he has seen repeated epochs of genial climate\r\nalternating with periods of severe cold.\r\n\r\nProf. Geikie was always deeply interested in this work, and followed\r\nthe course of investigation with the closest attention. Unfortunately\r\nScotland possesses no deposits containing palæolithic weapons; and\r\ncircumstances precluded him from taking part in the field studies\r\nexcept during brief holiday visits to the Continent; but he diligently\r\nread the literature, as may be seen in his course of Munro lectures\r\nin Edinburgh University in 1913, subsequently published in book form\r\nas _The Antiquity of Man in Europe_. In reading this book, it is\r\npleasant to find how little change he had been obliged to make in the\r\nconclusions he had arrived at twenty years before, and how fully his\r\nsagacious interpretation of the evidence then available had stood the\r\ntest of time. One can notice in his preface a serene conviction that\r\nhis work had been justified by the results.\r\n\r\n“The research of the past twenty years has certainly cleared up much\r\nthat was doubtful and obscure, and brought to light many interesting\r\ndetails which enable us to form a more adequate conception of the\r\nearly history of our race than was previously possible. These later\r\ninvestigations, however, have not in any respect shaken the general\r\nconclusions arrived at twenty years ago but, on the contrary, have\r\nserved only to strengthen and confirm them.”\r\n\r\nGradually also the difficult task of correlating the interglacial\r\ndeposits of Britain, Switzerland, and France was being mastered, and\r\neven the interglacial periods of North America were being relegated\r\nwith more or less confidence to their proper places with reference to\r\nthe European sequence, so that in this, his last book, he was able to\r\nannounce that solid progress had been made along the lines of advance\r\nwhich he had sketched, and his laborious investigations had produced\r\nvaluable results.\r\n\r\nProf. Geikie had always considered that much valuable knowledge of\r\nthe climatic changes which Scotland had undergone since the melting\r\nof the great ice-sheet would be obtained from a minute examination\r\nof the peat-bogs which cover large expanses both of the hills and\r\nof the plains of his native country. His own botanical training was\r\ninsufficient to enable him to attack such a problem with success,\r\nbut for many years he closely studied the geology of the peat-bogs,\r\nand never failed to impress on his students that a rich harvest of\r\nscientific information might be reaped by any investigator who took\r\nthis difficult task in hand. Fortunately he lived to see a very careful\r\nexamination of the flora of the Scottish peat-bogs by Prof. Lewis\r\npublished in four parts in _The Transactions of the Royal Society of\r\nEdinburgh_. Prof. Lewis was evidently much indebted to Prof. Geikie and\r\nto Dr Horne for suggestions and assistance in the geological part of\r\nhis work; but the evidence, which is very carefully and fully stated\r\nin his papers, is sufficient to carry conviction on several important\r\npoints. He shows that many of the peat mosses began their growth\r\nunder arctic conditions when glaciers must have existed in many of\r\nthe more elevated districts of Britain. Thereafter changes of climate\r\nsupervened, and were accompanied by changes in the flora, of which\r\nthe remains are now preserved in successive layers of peat. Speaking\r\ngenerally, we may say that the lowest arctic plant bed is followed by\r\na lower forest bed, usually rich in birch (and sometimes hazel and\r\nalder), which is overlain by a second arctic bed, followed in turn\r\nby a second or upper forest bed containing mostly roots and stools of\r\npine. Above these lies the modern peat. Prof. Lewis concluded as the\r\nresult of his researches that while it is difficult to reconcile the\r\nseveral stages in the peat with the theory of a single glaciation,\r\nthe whole of the peat beds agree very closely with the scheme of\r\nclassification proposed by Prof. Geikie (in the third edition of\r\n_The Great Ice Age_ published thirteen years before). These results\r\nwere none the less gratifying because they had been in some measure\r\nforeseen; and if we admit, as some maintain, that the final test of\r\nscientific hypothesis is the power to foresee the outcome of future\r\nresearches, we must agree that Prof. Geikie had good reason to feel\r\nthat his speculations on late-glacial changes in climate in Britain had\r\nnot been mistaken.\r\n\r\nWhen in course of time the third edition of _The Great Ice Age_ was\r\nsold out, he considered very carefully whether he should undertake a\r\nrevision of the book, bringing it up to date by incorporation of the\r\nmost recent additions to our knowledge of the glacial period. Advancing\r\nyears made him to some extent reluctant to undertake so formidable a\r\ntask, and he felt also that in his interpretation of the chief events\r\nof this chapter of geological history he had no radical alterations to\r\nmake. This, as we have already said, is sufficiently clear from his\r\nattitude in his Munro lectures. Moreover, the whole subject was highly\r\ncontroversial, and he greatly disliked fighting the old battles over\r\nagain. At one time he was seriously thinking of writing a short work\r\noutlining the most important recent advances in glacial geology, but\r\nthe intention was never carried into effect.\r\n\r\nProblems of tectonics and of the relations between geological structure\r\nand the surface configuration of the earth at the present time always\r\npossessed a strong fascination for him, and in his college lectures\r\nwere favourite topics for discussion. Belonging to both geology and\r\ngeography, these were subjects in which all his powers found congenial\r\nexercise. The _Scottish Geographical Magazine_ contains many papers\r\nfrom his pen dealing with physical geology, and the last of these which\r\nhe wrote was on “The Deeps of the Pacific Ocean and their Origin.” In\r\nthis paper he advocated a new interpretation of these great submarine\r\ndepressions, and as his views were not in accordance with those of\r\nProf. Suess of Vienna, as expounded in his great work _The Face\r\nof the Earth_, this paper was the occasion of a long and friendly\r\ncorrespondence with the eminent Austrian geologist (an Englishman by\r\nbirth). Prof. Geikie had always been a great admirer of Suess and a\r\nclose student of his writings, and both were attracted by the same\r\nkind of problems. In 1911 Prof. Geikie had written a paper on the\r\n“Architecture and Origin of the Alps” which appeared in the _Scottish\r\nGeographical Magazine_, and ten years previously more than one paper\r\non the origin and structure of mountains had been contributed by him\r\nto various journals. He now determined to use the materials he had\r\ncollected for the preparation of a book which was ultimately issued\r\nunder the title _Mountains: their Origin, Growth, and Decay_. As\r\nusual he did not despise the non-scientific reader, but made his\r\nexposition of the subject so simple and clear that all could apprehend\r\nhis meaning. A vast amount of important work had been done on the\r\ngeological structure of the Alps during the previous ten years, and\r\nin addition to reading the literature carefully, Prof. Geikie visited\r\nSwitzerland to make himself familiar with the scenes he described, and\r\nto enable him to form an opinion on the theories advanced, based on\r\npersonal examination of some of the best sections. At the same time he\r\nutilised the results of the work of his old colleagues of the Scottish\r\nSurvey on the North-west Highlands, where they had gleaned new data of\r\nthe highest value, and the book was illustrated with many beautiful\r\nphotographs of Scottish and Alpine mountains. Throughout the book the\r\ninfluence of Prof. Suess is often noticeable. The compilation of this\r\nbook was a thoroughly congenial task to Prof. Geikie. He was content\r\nfor a time to let glacial controversies rest, and to concentrate his\r\nattention on problems of geographical evolution.\r\n\r\nIn bringing to a close this short review of Prof. Geikie’s scientific\r\nwork, we may be permitted to point out what seems to be the main\r\ncharacteristics of his investigation and teaching. Had he been\r\nquestioned himself on this point, there can be no doubt he would\r\nhave given his University courses of instruction a high place in his\r\nservices to science. He never allowed himself to regard it as routine\r\nwork, to be hurried through without enthusiasm. He gave his best to\r\nhis students, and constantly improved his lectures, excursions, and\r\npractical classes, so as to make them as modern and as complete as\r\ncircumstances would allow. Hampered by very inadequate accommodation\r\nand equipment, he gave freely of his time and money to compensate\r\nfor these disadvantages. The ordinary student he strove to interest\r\nand to instruct, and as year by year his classes increased, he had\r\ngood evidence to convince him that both his subject and his method of\r\nexpounding it were receiving their full share of attention among the\r\nstudents of the University. But he had a keen eye for merit, and young\r\nmen who evinced a desire to pursue the path of original research were\r\nquickly recognised and encouraged in every way to follow the right\r\nlines. Thus, although geology was for a long time a very small class,\r\nit produced almost every year one or more men who subsequently made\r\na name for themselves in science. All over the world, and especially\r\nin the British colonies, there are many well-known geologists who can\r\ntrace the impetus which decided their careers to the lectures delivered\r\nby the genial professor in the dingy old Edinburgh class-room at the\r\ntop of those interminable stairs.\r\n\r\nAs a geologist he had limitations which he clearly recognised.\r\nPalæontology, petrology, and mineralogy he had a sound working\r\nknowledge of, but he never professed to know them thoroughly, and\r\nmuch of the teaching of these subjects he left to specially trained\r\nassistants. Had he been better equipped in these respects, he might\r\nhave avoided some of the pitfalls into which he stumbled at times.\r\nBut in physical and structural geology he took a very high place\r\namong living scientists. The thorough training and natural aptitude\r\nfor structural and field geology made him a very shrewd judge of\r\ncontroversial questions in tectonics, and laid a secure foundation\r\nfor his researches in geographical evolution and the origin of the\r\nearth’s surface features. As a geographer, interested especially in the\r\nlarger problems of geographical configuration, he earned a world-wide\r\nreputation. His special field of work, however, was the history of the\r\nglacial period in all its aspects, and as time went on he came to be\r\nrecognised as the most thorough-going advocate of repeated glacial and\r\ninterglacial epochs. The positions he took up at a very early stage\r\nin his scientific career he maintained with little modification till\r\nits close, and in spite of indifference and in the face of severe\r\ncriticism he saw his theories more and more completely established year\r\nby year. The subject is one of the most controversial in geological\r\nscience at the present day. Very eminent authorities may be found who\r\ndeny the validity of nearly every one of Prof. Geikie’s conclusions\r\nabout interglacial epochs, but there is a large and increasing body\r\nof supporters of his views, though even now the extreme position he\r\ntook up in subdividing the Ice Age into six glacial periods cannot be\r\nsaid to be generally accepted. But if we compare the text-books of the\r\npresent day with those published twenty years ago, we can realise how\r\ngreat an advance has been made in the direction in which he led; and\r\nthere can be no doubt that in the long-run his consistency, courage,\r\nand sagacity will receive full recognition.\r\n\r\nThe old Scottish school of geology which had numbered so many\r\nfamous men among its members found in James Geikie one of its most\r\ndistinguished representatives. In science, as in all things, he was\r\npre-eminently a Scotsman. Ramsay and Croll, two of the most philosophic\r\ngeologists of their time, were the men to whom he owed the inspiration\r\nwhich originally directed him, and he was a true disciple of Playfair,\r\nwhose memory he reverenced. In all his writings he places in the\r\nforeground the observations which he and his fellow-workers in Scotland\r\nhad made in the field, and the inferences drawn from them; and it was\r\nin no small measure to James Geikie that the high position which the\r\nwork of Scottish geologists holds in the estimation of scientific men\r\nis to be ascribed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF PUBLICATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n 1866. “On the Metamorphic Lower Silurian Rocks of Carrick, Ayrshire,”\r\n _Quart.
