His grandfather still kept most of the titles, and was called\r\nSavinien de Cyrano Mauvières Bergerac Saint-Laurent. He was secretary\r\nto the King in 1571, and held other important offices. Since there\r\nwas no absolute right of primo-geniture in those matters, the names,\r\nas well as what was left of the properties they had represented, were\r\ndistributed among his descendants. Our hero seems to have received a\r\nfair share of the titles; but of the property, nothing.\r\n\r\nHe was the fifth among seven children, and was born on the 6th of\r\nMarch, 1619; not in 1620, as has been usually stated. He was born,\r\nmoreover, at Paris, not in Gascony; we must, alas, admit that he was\r\nnot a Gascon. He ought to have been one, he certainly deserved to be\r\none. But Fortune, who seems to have taken pleasure in always making him\r\njust miss his destiny, began by doing him this first and greatest wrong\r\nof not letting him be born a Gascon. The family was not even of distant\r\nGascon origin, but was Périgourdin; Bergerac itself is a small town\r\nnear Périgueux. Cyrano, however, did his best to repair this as well as\r\nthe other wrongs of Destiny; he acquired the Gascon accent, and often\r\nmade himself pass for a Gascon.\r\n\r\nThe fortune of his early education made him fall into the hands of a\r\ncountry curate, who was an insufferable pedant (the species seems to\r\nhave been common at that time), and who had no real scholarship (the\r\ntwo things are by no means contradictory). Cyrano dubbed his master an\r\n\"Aristotelic Ass,\" and wrote to his father that he preferred Paris.\r\n\r\nThis period of exile had one very important result, however: the\r\nformation of his first and most lasting friendship, that with Lebret,\r\nwho shared in the instruction of the country curate, but with a more\r\ndocile acceptance of his teachings. Here again Fortune seems to have\r\nplayed tricks with Cyrano, in giving him by accident for lifelong\r\nfriend one who just missed being what a real friend should be; who was\r\ntrue and loyal, but who was always seeking to reform Cyrano or to push\r\nhim forward in the world; who admired him, who loved him, but who was\r\nof such opposite nature that he understood him not at all.\r\n\r\nBack at Paris, Cyrano was sent to the Collège de Beauvais afterward\r\nRacine's college where he completed the course, under the principalship\r\nof another pedant named Grangier, who was a little more scholarly,\r\nbut no less ridiculous than the first, and who figures in the leading\r\nrôle of Cyrano's comedy _Le Pédant joué_. He lived the Paris student's\r\nlife, burning honest tradesmen's signs and \"doing other crazy things,\"\r\nas his contemporary Tallemant des Réaux tells us. On leaving college\r\nhe started upon a downward track, according to Lebret; \"on which,\"\r\nsays the same good Lebret, \"I dare to boast that I stopped him ... by\r\ncompelling him to enter the company of the Guards with me.\" It may be\r\ndoubted whether a temporary suspension of the paternal allowance had\r\nnothing to do with the matter; and whether, after all, Cyrano felt so\r\nmuch repugnance to entering this company of the Guards.\r\n\r\nFor this company was the famous regiment of the \"garde-nobles,\"\r\ncommanded by Carbon de Castel-Jaloux, a \"triple Gascon\" and a \"triple\r\nbrave.\" And his men were hardly a step behind him, all of them nobles\r\nthat was an essential condition of entrance and almost all of them\r\nGascons. Cyrano, at first in the position rather of the Christian than\r\nof the Cyrano of M. Rostand's play, by his gallantry and wit compelled\r\nthem to accept him, and even won among these \"braves\" the title of\r\n\"_démon de la bravoure_.\" Unable to be the most Gascon of the Gascons,\r\nhe made it up by being more Gascon than the Gascons.\r\n\r\nAmong his exploits the most famous is that of the fight with the\r\nhundred ruffians; for this appears to be not a dramatic creation or\r\na legend, but history. One of his poet-friends, Linière (the name\r\nis sometimes spelt Lignière) a writer of epigram and contributor\r\nto the \"Recueils\" or \"Keep-sakes\" of the epoch, had wounded the\r\nsusceptibilities of a certain \"grand seigneur,\" who planned to avenge\r\nhimself by the same method which another noble lord, in the eighteenth\r\ncentury, actually used against Voltaire. He posted his hundred men at\r\nthe Porte de Nesle, to waylay Linière. Linière, hearing of it, came to\r\ntake refuge with Cyrano for the night. But Cyrano would not receive\r\nhim. \"No, you shall sleep at home,\" said he. \"Here, take this lantern\"\r\n(this is M. Brun's version), \"walk behind me and hold the light, and\r\nI'll make bed-quilts of them for you!\" And the next morning there were\r\nfound scattered about the Porte de Nesle two dead men, seven wounded,\r\nand many hats, sticks, and pikes.\r\n\r\nAccording to Lebret's account, the battle took place in broad daylight,\r\nand had several witnesses. For the rest, his story coincides with that\r\nabove. And all versions agree in saying that M. de Cuigy and M. de\r\nBrissailles both men of the time fairly well known: one the son of an\r\nAdvocate of the Parliament of Paris, the other Mestre de Camp of the\r\nPrince de Conti's regiment bore witness to the facts; and that the\r\nstory became generally known, and was never denied. Perhaps it will not\r\nbe well to guarantee the exactness of the number one hundred; but the\r\nstory must be for the most part true.\r\n\r\nAnother exploit, less magnificent, but perhaps as characteristic of the\r\nwild temper of Cyrano, is his battle with Fagotin. A mountebank named\r\nBrioché had a theatre of marionnettes, near the Pont-Neuf, and used\r\nan ape called Fagotin, fantastically dressed, to attract spectators.\r\nSome enemy of Cyrano, perhaps Dassoucy, one day persuaded Brioché to\r\ndress his ape up in imitation of Cyrano, with long sword and nose as\r\nlong. Cyrano, arriving and seeing this parody of himself exalted on a\r\nplatform, unsheathes in blind rage, drives the crowd of lackeys and\r\nloafers right and left with the flat of his sword, and impales the\r\npoor ape who was holding out his sword in a posture of self-defence.\r\nAccording to the contemporary pamphlet, partly in prose and partly in\r\nverse, which was made upon this marvellous adventure, Brioché brought\r\nsuit for damages against Bergerac. But even in these ridiculous\r\ncircumstances Cyrano managed to get the laughers on his side; and\r\nclaiming that in the country of art there was no such thing as gold and\r\nsilver, and that he had a right to pay in the money of the country,\r\nhe promised to eternize the dead ape in Apollinic verse; and so was\r\nacquitted.\r\n\r\nThe story of Montfleury, the fat actor whom Cyrano detested, is hardly\r\nless fantastic; and in connection with it we have the witness of\r\nCyrano's own letter \"Against Montfleury the Fat, bad Actor and bad\r\nAuthor,\" the tenth of the _Satiric Letters_. According to all the books\r\nof theatrical anecdotes, Cyrano one evening ordered him off the stage,\r\nand forbade him to reappear for a month; and when two days later he\r\ndid reappear, Cyrano once more drove him in disgrace to the wings. The\r\naudience protesting, Cyrano challenged them each and all to meet him\r\nin duel, and carried his point. Whether he offered to take down their\r\nnames in order or not, does not appear.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, more serious work turned up. The regiment of the\r\ncadets was sent against the Germans, entered Mouzon, was besieged\r\nthere. In a sortie, Cyrano was seriously wounded, a musket-ball passing\r\nthrough his body. Hardly recovered from his wound, he rejoined the army\r\nat the siege of Arras, in 1640; unfortunately for the story, he was\r\nprobably no longer with the cadets there, but in the regiment of the\r\nPrince de Conti. Again he was wounded, this time even more seriously,\r\nwith a sword-cut in the throat. And compelled to abandon the military\r\ncareer, he returned to Paris and took up his studies and his writing.\r\n\r\nFor he had always been a student and a poet. It is probable that\r\nthe _Pédant joué_ was in part composed during his college days.\r\nLebret pictures him to us as studying between two duels, and working\r\nat an Elegy in all the noise of the regimental barracks, \"as\r\nundistractedly as if he had been in a quiet study.\" He now joined a\r\ngroup of independents in thought and life, naturalists in ethics and\r\nempiricists in philosophy, and forced his way into a private class of\r\nthe philosopher Gassendi, where he had for fellow-students Hesnaut,\r\nChapelle, Bernier, and almost certainly a young Jean-Baptiste\r\nPoquelin, who was very soon to take the name of Molière, found the\r\n\"Illustre Théâtre,\" and after its failure start on a fifteen years'\r\ntour of the provinces.\r\n\r\nCyrano was an earnest and capable student of philosophy, and came to\r\nit with the fresh interest not only of his own personality, but of a\r\nyoung man of barely twenty-two; he naturally imposed himself as a sort\r\nof leader in the group of young \"libertins\" or free-thinkers, just as\r\nhe had done among the Guards. He knew well not only Gassendi, but also\r\nCampanella, and of course Descartes, in his works at least. He even\r\nseems to have read widely among the half-philosophers, half-occultists\r\nof the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, such as Cornelius\r\nAgrippa, Jerome Cardan, Abbot Tritheim, César de Nostradamus, etc.\r\nAmong the ancients, his first favorites were Lucretius and Pyrrho:\r\nPyrrho whom he especially admired, \"because he was so nobly free, that\r\nno thinker of his age had been able to enslave his opinions; and so\r\nmodest, that he would never give final decision on any point.\" There is\r\nmuch of Cyrano in this phrase, both in the half-bold modesty and in the\r\nhalf-timid fierceness of independence. Cyrano shuddered at the thought\r\nof having even a single one of his ideas enslaved to those of another\r\nthinker. Just as he had refused the Maréchal de Gassion for patron when\r\nhe was in the Guards, so he would accept no one's _magister dixit_, no\r\npatron of his thought, not even the Aristotle of the Schools.\r\n\r\nThe period of his life from 1643 to 1653 is a very obscure one. Yet\r\nprobably almost all of his works were composed during this time. He may\r\nhave travelled; there are traditions and suggestions that he visited\r\nEngland, Italy, even Poland. He probably stood in danger of persecution\r\nfrom the Jesuits on account of his philosophical ideas, and may have\r\nsuffered it, as did his contemporaries Campanella and Galileo, or, to\r\nmention a French poet only a little older than he, _Théophile de Viau_,\r\nwho was even condemned to death for less independence than Cyrano's;\r\nthough the sentence was fortunately commuted. He probably mingled\r\nsomewhat in the society of the \"Précieuses\" of the time as well as in\r\nthat of the \"libertins\"; for he has left a series of \"Love-Letters\"\r\nwhich must almost exactly have suited the taste of those who prepared\r\nDiscourses on the Tender Passion. He probably had many duels still, for\r\nLebret tells us that he served a hundred times as second--the round\r\nnumber is to be taken as such--and any one acquainted with the epoch,\r\nor with the _Three Musketeers_ of Dumas, knows that the seconds fought\r\nas well as the principals. Lebret adds, to be sure, that he never had\r\na quarrel on his own account, but we may perhaps take this as a bit\r\nof the conscientious \"white-washing\" which Lebret could not refrain\r\nfrom in speaking of his friend's reputation; for we know enough of his\r\ncharacter even from Lebret, and of his life from other sources, to\r\nmake a gentle peacefulness, so out of keeping with the epoch, somewhat\r\ndoubtful; and then there was his nose.\r\n\r\nThe Nose is authentic also. It appears in all the portraits, of which\r\nthere are four. And in all of these it is the same: not a little ugly\r\nnose, flat at the top and projecting at the bottom in a little long\r\ngable turned up at the end; but a large, generous, well-shaped nose,\r\nhooked rather than retroussé, and planted squarely in the symmetrical\r\nmiddle of the face; not ridiculous, but monumental! The anecdotes of\r\nthe duels it caused are so many, that one comes in spite of oneself\r\nto believe some of them. It is said that this nose brought death upon\r\nmore than ten persons; that one could not look upon it, but he must\r\nunsheathe; if one looked away, it was worse; and as for speaking of\r\nNoses, that was a subject which Cyrano reserved for himself, to do it\r\nfitting honor. Listen to his treatment of it in the _Pédant joué_: \"This\r\nveridic nose arrives everywhere a quarter of an hour before its master.\r\nTen shoemakers, good round fat ones too, go and sit down to work under\r\nit out of the rain.\" As for defending large noses, as the index of\r\nvalor, intelligence, and all high qualities, it will appear in the\r\n_Voyage to the Moon_ that he could do it as well with his pen as with\r\nhis sword.\r\n\r\nThe end of his life was difficult and sad. He was finally compelled\r\nto accept the patronage of the Duc d'Arpajon, for no man could live\r\nor even exist by literature at that period, except as literature\r\nbrought patronage or pensions. The great Corneille himself, than\r\nwhom no one could be more simply sturdy and high of character, wrote\r\nbegging letters to the great minister who controlled the pensions of\r\nliterature. Cyrano dedicated the edition of his \"Miscellaneous Works\"\r\nin 1654 to the Duc d'Arpajon, in an epistle which fulfils, but with\r\ndignity and independence, the laws of the _genre_, and accompanied it\r\nwith a sonnet addressed to the Duke's daughter, which is in the taste\r\nof the time, yet considerably better than the taste of the time. Things\r\nwent well till _Agrippine_ appeared, which had a \"succès de scandale\";\r\nbut its \"belles impiétés,\" as the happy book-seller called them, seem\r\nto have pleased the timidly orthodox Duke less. In the meantime Cyrano\r\nhad received a wound from a falling beam whether by mere accident or\r\nnot, will never be known; but Cyrano had many enemies, and it has\r\ngenerally been thought that there was purpose behind the accident.\r\nFor whatever reason, the Duc d'Arpajon seems to have advised Cyrano\r\nto leave him, and Cyrano was received by Regnault des Bois-Clairs,\r\na friend of Lebret. There he was kindly cared for and lectured on\r\nthe evil of his past life by Lebret and three women of the Convent\r\nof the Daughters of the Cross: Soeur Hyacinthe, an aunt of Cyrano\r\nhimself; Mère Marguerite, the superior of the convent; and the Baronne\r\nde Neuvillette, a cousin of Cyrano, who was Madeleine Robineau, and\r\nhad married the Baron Christophe de Neuvillette, killed at the siege\r\nof Arras in 1640. The three women persuaded themselves that they had\r\nconverted Cyrano to the true Church. This is doubtful, since he dragged\r\nhimself away to the country to die, at the house of the cousin whom he\r\nspeaks of at the end of the _Voyage to the Moon_. In any case, Mère\r\nMarguerite reclaimed his body, and he was buried in holy ground at the\r\nconvent.\r\n\r\n_The Voyage to the Moon_ was not published till 1656, the year after\r\nCyrano's death. It was certainly written as early as 1650, probably in\r\n1649. It had been circulated widely in manuscript, and possibly a few\r\ncopies had been printed, before the author's death. _The Voyage to the\r\nSun_, or, to give the title more accurately, the \"Comic History of the\r\nStates and Empires of the Sun,\" was probably written immediately after\r\nthe _Voyage to the Moon_, but was not published till 1662. The _History\r\nof the Spark_ has never been found, unless that be the subtitle of a\r\npart of the Voyage to the Sun, as seems fairly probable.\r\n\r\nThe _Letters_ of Cyrano are, in part at least, his earliest work.\r\nThey were probably scattered over a considerable period in point of\r\ncomposition, but most of them were published in 1654. It is to be\r\nremembered that like all the letters of that epoch which we have, they\r\nwere meant to be read in company, in the salons, or sometimes (like\r\nthat \"Against Dassoucy\"), in the taverns, corresponding to the modern\r\ncafés, where men of letters gathered. They were written not for the\r\npostman, but for the parlor; and not so much for the parlor as for the\r\nprinter. But even with the artificiality of this method, and with the\r\nburlesque or précieuse expression that was obligatory in Letters at\r\nthat time, there are touches of real sincerity and passion constantly\r\nbreaking through.\r\n\r\nThe _Pédant joué_ is a prose-comedy in five acts, made almost entirely\r\non the model of the Italian \"commedia dell' arte,\" a form in which\r\nMolière's early work is written, and which was practically the only\r\nform known at the time when Cyrano wrote for the play is certainly\r\nanterior to Corneille's _Menteur_. We have the almost obligatory two\r\npairs of young lovers; the old father who is tyrannical but easily\r\ndeceived in this particular case combined with the pedant-doctor type;\r\nthe valet who does the deceiving, in the service of the young lovers;\r\nand the terrible captain, who takes flight at the shadow of danger.\r\nCyrano has, however, introduced one new type a peasant with his dialect\r\nand local characteristics: a type that Molière used to great advantage\r\nlater, but hardly so very much better than Cyrano uses it here;\r\nwitness the fact that a number of this peasant's phrases have become\r\nproverbs. The famous scene of \"qu'allait-il faire dans cette galère\"\r\n(despairingly repeated by the father who is compelled to give up his\r\ncherished money for the ransom of a son held in captivity supposedly on\r\na Turkish galley) is exceedingly well imagined, and Molière did well\r\nto use it, sixteen years after Cyrano's death, for the two best scenes\r\nof his _Fourberies de Scapin_. It is not a matter to reproach Molière\r\nwith, but it is a case in which Cyrano should receive due credit.\r\n\r\nThe only serious poetical work of Cyrano is his tragedy of _Agrippine,\r\nveuve de Germanicus_, written at some time in the forties, played in\r\n1653, and published in 1654. The statement, repeated categorically\r\nby Mr. Sidney Lee in his recent Life of Shakespeare, that \"Cyrano\r\nde Bergerac plagiarized 'Cymbeline,' 'Hamlet,' and 'The Merchant\r\nof Venice' in his 'Agrippina,'\" has not the slightest foundation.\r\nThere are no resemblances, either superficial or essential, on which\r\nto base it, and it is altogether improbable that Cyrano even knew of\r\nShakespeare's existence. The subject of Agrippine is similar to that\r\nof Corneille's _Cinna_--a conspiracy under the Roman Empire. There are\r\nno resemblances to Corneille's work in the details of the plot, but\r\nin general spirit the play is what we call Cornelian, partly because\r\nCorneille was the only one who possessed this spirit of the epoch with\r\nsufficient creative and individual power to compel the attention of\r\nposterity. Cyrano, once more, just missed this. But his play is worthy\r\nnot only to be ranked with the best dramas of any of his contemporaries\r\nexcept Corneille, but even to be at least compared with Corneille's\r\nbetter work (except perhaps the _Cid_ and _Polyeucte_). The play is\r\nnot thoroughly well constructed, and so misses something of dramatic\r\neffectiveness, though by no means missing it entirely; but it is as\r\nwell constructed as Corneille's _Cinna_, and better than his Horace to\r\ntake examples only among his greatest plays. It has no scene to compare\r\nwith that of the clemency of Augustus in _Cinna_, no character-study\r\nso fine as that of the different sentiments of Augustus. But it\r\napproaches, though it does not quite attain, the heroics of _Horace_.\r\nIt is full of exaggeration so is Corneille; and of an exaggeration that\r\nsometimes becomes burlesque as in Corneille; but it is an exaggeration\r\nthat is high and heroic, like Corneille's. And the high and heroic\r\nsometimes as in a line like this:\r\n\r\n    Et puis, mourir n'est rien; c'est achever de naître--\r\n\r\nsometimes, but too rarely, drops its exaggeration to become simple as\r\nsimple as real heroism, which is the simplest thing in the world.\r\n\r\nExcept real genius. Real genius is, finally, the essential thing, which\r\nCyrano once more just missed attaining missed just by the lack of\r\nthat simplicity, perhaps. But exaggeration, sometimes carried to the\r\nburlesque, is the essential trait which makes him what he is; and we\r\ncannot wish it away.\r\n\r\n                                                  CURTIS HIDDEN PAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE ON THE TRANSLATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere have been at least three translations into English of the _Voyage\r\nto the Moon_: that alluded to on page 1; the present translation; and\r\none made in the eighteenth century by Samuel Derrick. The last is\r\ndedicated to the Earl of Orrery, author of \"Remarks on the Life and\r\nWritings of Jonathan Swift,\" and attributes its \"call from obscurity\"\r\nto \"your Lordship's mentioning it in your _Life of Swift_\" as having\r\nserved for inspiration to _Gulliver's Travels_.\r\n\r\nSamuel Derrick's translation, however, is not so good as that of\r\nA. Lovell. The seventeenth century translation is more flowery and\r\nfanciful, and by that very fact closer to the original. For though the\r\n_Voyage to the Moon_ is the most sober in style of Cyrano's works, yet\r\nthere are still many touches of the \"high fantastical\" in its manner\r\nas well as in its substance. The eighteenth century translator has\r\ntoned down the style to make it more acceptable to that age of reason\r\nand regularity. It is still another case of the irony of Fate pursuing\r\nCyrano; the regularity of seventeenth century literature in France,\r\nagainst whom he struggled so swashbucklerly, had completely triumphed\r\nand spread their influence over Europe; so that even in the land where\r\nliberty and individuality are native, his work had to suffer correction\r\nin all its most fanciful passages. There are constant omissions of\r\nphrases or sentences in the eighteenth century translation, and\r\nthere are also numerous mistakes, as well as many points missed.\r\nThe seventeenth century translation, on the other hand, is faithful\r\nthroughout to its original, and accurate as well as vivid.\r\n\r\nThe translation has been compared throughout with the French of the\r\nedition of 1661, and the two or three slight corrections needed have\r\nbeen made in footnotes. Except for the breaking up of some very long\r\nparagraphs, and slight changes in punctuation when necessary for\r\nclearness, the text has been reprinted as exactly as possible.

For\r\nit is the Excellency of Art, to represent Nature even in her absence;\r\nand this being a Piece done to the Life, by one that had the advantage\r\nof the true Light, as well as the Skill of Drawing, in this kind, to\r\nPerfection; he left so good an Original, which was so well Copied by\r\nanother Hand, that the Picture might have served for many Years more,\r\nto have given the Lovers of the Moon, a sight of their Mistress, even\r\nin the darkest Nights; and when she was retired to put on a clean Smock\r\nin Phoebus his Apartment; if they had been so curious, as to have\r\nencouraged the Exposers.\r\n\r\nHowever, Reader, you have now a second View of her, and that under the\r\nsame Cover with the Sun too, which is very rare; since these two were\r\nnever seen before in Conjunction. Yet I would have none be afraid,\r\nthat their Eyes being dazzled with the glorious Light of the Sun, they\r\nshould not see her; for Fancy will supply the Weakness of the Organ,\r\nand Imagination, by the help of this Mirrour, will not fail to discover\r\nthem both; though Cynthia lye hid under Apollo's shining Mantle. And so\r\nmuch for the Luminaries.\r\n\r\nNow as to the Worlds, which, with Analogy to ours below, I may call the\r\nOld and New; that of the Moon having been discovered, tho imperfectly,\r\nby others, but the Sun owing its Discovery wholly to our Author:[2]\r\nI make no doubt, but the Ingenious Reader will find in both, so\r\nextraordinary and surprizing Rarities, as well Natural, Moral, as\r\nCivil; that if he be not as yet sufficiently disgusted with this lower\r\nWorld, (which I am sure some are) to think of making a Voyage thither,\r\nas our Author has done; he will at least be pleased with his Relations.\r\nNevertheless, since this Age produces a great many bold Wits, that\r\nshoot even beyond the Moon, and cannot endure, (no more than our\r\nAuthor) to be stinted by Magisterial Authority, and to believe nothing\r\nbut what Gray-headed Antiquity gives them leave: It's pity some soaring\r\nVirtuoso, instead of Travelling into France, does not take a flight up\r\nto the Sun; and by new Observations supply the defects of its History;\r\noccasioned not by the Negligence of our Witty French Author, but by the\r\naccursed Plagiary of some rude Hand, that in his Sickness, rifted his\r\nTrunks, and stole his Papers, as he himself complains.[3]\r\n\r\nLet some venturous Undertaker auspiciously attempt it then;\r\nand if neither of the two Universities, Gresham-College, nor\r\nGreenwich-Observatory can furnish him with an Instrument of\r\nConveyance; let him try his own Invention, or make use of our Author's\r\nMachine: For our Loss is, indeed, so great, that one would think,\r\nnone but the declared Enemy of Mankind, would have had the Malice, to\r\npurloyn and stiffle those rare Discoveries, which our Author made in\r\nthe Province of the Solar Philosophers; and which undoubtedly would\r\nhave gone far, as to the settleing our Sublunary Philosophy, which, as\r\nwell as Religion, is lamentably rent by Sects and Whimseys; and have\r\nconvinced us, perhaps, that in our present Doubts and Perplexities, a\r\nlittle more, or a little less of either, would better serve our Turns,\r\nand more content our Minds.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] This evidently refers to an earlier translation of the _Voyage\r\nto the Moon_, published probably in 1660. The present editor will be\r\ngreatly obliged to any one who will put him on the track of a copy\r\nof this, or any other early translation from Cyrano, such as the\r\n\"Satyrical Characters and handsome Descriptions, in Letters, written to\r\nseveral Persons of Quality, by Monsieur De Cyrano Bergerac. Translated\r\nfrom the French, by a Person of Honor. London, 1658.\"\r\n\r\n[2] Among the \"others\" who had previously \"discovered\" the Moon,\r\nAriosto is the most prominent. In his _Orlando Furioso_, Astolfo\r\ngoes to the moon, visits the \"Valley of Lost Things,\" finds there\r\nmany broken resolutions, idlers' days, lovers' tears, and other such\r\nmatters; and finally recovers Orlando's lost wits, which he brings back\r\nto the earth.\r\n\r\nThe _Satire Ménippée_ (1594) gives, in its _Supplément_, \"News from the\r\nRegions of the Moon.\"\r\n\r\nQuevedo, the Spanish satirist and novelist (1580-1645), with whose\r\nworks Cyrano was acquainted, also gives an account of the moon in his\r\nSixth Vision.\r\n\r\nIn England, the Rev. John Wilkins (1614-1672), once Principal\r\nof Trinity College, Cambridge, and later Bishop of Chester, a\r\nbrother-in-law of Cromwell, and one of the founders of the Royal\r\nSociety, published in 1638 the \"_Discovery of a New World_; or, a\r\nDiscourse to prove it is probable there may be another habitable\r\nworld in the Moon; with a discourse concerning _the possibility of a\r\npassage thither_\"; and later, in 1640, the \"_Discourse_ concerning a\r\nnew Planet; tending to prove it is probable our earth is one of the\r\nPlanets.\" These two works are said to have done more than any others to\r\npopularize the Copernican system in England. The _Discovery of a New\r\nWorld_ was translated into French by Jean de Montagne, and published\r\nat Rouen in 1655 or 1656. See Charles Nodier, _Mélanges extraits d'une\r\npetite bibliothèque_.\r\n\r\nFinally, the most important of Cyrano's predecessors in the discovery\r\nof the moon was Francis Godwin, M.A., D.D., Bishop of Llandaff and\r\nlater of Hereford (1562-1633). It was not till 1638, after the worthy\r\nBishop's death, and in the same year that Rev. (later Bishop) John\r\nWilkins' _Discovery of a New World_ was published, that there appeared\r\nhis \"_Man in the Moone_; or a Discourse of a Voyage Thither, by Domingo\r\nGonsales, the Speedy Messenger.\" This was translated into French by\r\nJean Baudoin or Baudouin in 1648, as \"L'homme dans la lune ... voyage\r\n... fait par Dominique Gonzales, aventurier espagnol,\" and was well\r\nknown to Cyrano, as we shall see.\r\n\r\nIn saying that \"the sun owes its discovery wholly to our author,\" the\r\ntranslator appears to be ignorant of a work which Cyrano certainly\r\nknew: the _Civitas solis_ of Campanella, published in 1623 as a part of\r\nhis _Realis Philosophiæ Epilogisticæ Partes IV_.\r\n\r\n[3] Cf. the last sentence of the _Voyage to the Moon_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(The Title-page of Lovell's translation.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMICAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nof the\r\n\r\nSTATES and EMPIRES\r\n\r\nof the WORLD of the MOON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWritten in French by\r\n\r\nCYRANO BERGERAC.\r\n\r\nAnd now Englished by\r\n\r\nA.

Our Eyes being fixed upon that\r\nstately Planet, every one spoke what he thought of it: One would needs\r\nhave it be a Garret Window of Heaven; another presently affirmed, That\r\nit was the Pan whereupon _Diana_ smoothed _Apollo's_ Bands; whilst\r\nanother was of Opinion, That it might very well be the Sun himself, who\r\nputting his Locks up under his Cap at Night, peeped through a hole to\r\nobserve what was doing in the World during his absence.\r\n\r\n\"And for my part, Gentlemen,\" said I, \"that I may put in for a share,\r\nand guess with the rest; not to amuse my self with those curious\r\nNotions wherewith you tickle and spur on slow-paced Time; I believe,\r\nthat the Moon is a World like ours, to which this of ours serves\r\nlikewise for a Moon.\"\r\n\r\nThis was received with the general Laughter of the Company. \"And\r\nperhaps,\" said I, \"(Gentlemen) just so they laugh now in the Moon, at\r\nsome who maintain, That this Globe, where we are, is a World.\" But I'd\r\nas good have said nothing, as have alledged to them, That a great many\r\nLearned Men had been of the same Opinion; for that only made them laugh\r\nthe faster.\r\n\r\nHowever, this thought, which because of its boldness suited my Humor,\r\nbeing confirmed by Contradiction, sunk so deep into my mind, that\r\nduring the rest of the way I was big with Definitions of the Moon which\r\nI could not be delivered of: Insomuch that by striving to verifie this\r\nComical Fancy by Reasons of appearing weight, I had almost perswaded my\r\nself already of the truth on't; when a Miracle, Accident, Providence,\r\nFortune, or what, perhaps, some may call Vision, others Fiction,\r\nWhimsey, or (if you will) Folly, furnished me with an occasion that\r\nengaged me into this Discourse. Being come home, I went up into my\r\nCloset, where I found a Book open upon the Table, which I had not put\r\nthere. It was a piece of _Cardanus_[2]; and though I had no design\r\nto read in it, yet I fell at first sight, as by force, exactly upon\r\na Passage of that Philosopher where he tells us, That Studying one\r\nevening by Candle-light, he perceived Two tall old Men enter in through\r\nthe door that was shut, who after many questions that he put to them,\r\nmade him answer, That they were Inhabitants of the Moon, and thereupon\r\nimmediately disappeared.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CYRANO IN HIS STUDY.--From a 17th Century Engraving]\r\n\r\nI was so surprised, not only to see a Book get thither of it self; but\r\nalso because of the nicking of the Time so patly, and of the Page at\r\nwhich it lay upon, that I looked upon that Concatenation of Accidents\r\nas a Revelation, discovering to Mortals that the Moon is a World.\r\n\"How!\" said I to my self, having just now talked of a thing, can a\r\nBook, which perhaps is the only Book in the World that treats of that\r\nmatter so particularly, fly down from the Shelf upon my Table; become\r\ncapable of Reason, in opening so exactly at the place of so strange\r\nan adventure; force my Eyes in a manner to look upon it, and then to\r\nsuggest to my fancy the Reflexions, and to my Will the Designs which I\r\nhatch.\r\n\r\n\"Without doubt,\" continued I, \"the Two old Men, who appeared to that\r\nfamous Philosopher, are the very same who have taken down my Book and\r\nopened it at that Page, to save themselves the labour of making to me\r\nthe Harangue which they made to _Cardan_.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" added I, \"I cannot be resolved of this Doubt, unless I mount up\r\nthither.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why not?\" said I instantly to my self. \"_Prometheus_ heretofore\r\nwent up to Heaven, and stole fire from thence. Have not I as much\r\nBoldness as he? And why should not I, then, expect as favourable a\r\nSuccess?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Monsieur de Cuigy, who is mentioned by Lebret as a friend\r\nand admirer of Cyrano, and who was one of the witnesses of his\r\nfamous battle against the hundred ruffians, possessed an estate at\r\nClamart-sous-Meudon, near Paris. He appears as a character in M.\r\nRostand's play of _Cyrano de Bergerac_.\r\n\r\n[2] Jerome Cardan, 1501-1576, natural philosopher, doctor, astrologer,\r\nmathematician, and a voluminous author; in short, a sort of Italian\r\nParacelsus, both by his universal learning, and by his intense interest\r\nin all domains of possible knowledge, in which he included astrology\r\nand necromancy. His most important work is the one referred to here,\r\nthe _De Subtilitate Rerum_, 1551.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n_Of how the Author set out, and where he first arrived._\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter these sudden starts of Imagination, which may be termed, perhaps,\r\nthe Ravings of a violent Feaver, I began to conceive some hopes of\r\nsucceeding in so fair a Voyage: Insomuch that to take my measures\r\naright, I shut my self up in a solitary Country-house; where having\r\nflattered my fancy with some means, proportionated to my design, at\r\nlength I set out for Heaven in this manner.\r\n\r\nI planted my self in the middle of a great many Glasses full of Dew,\r\ntied fast about me;[1] upon which the Sun so violently darted his Rays,\r\nthat the Heat, which attracted them, as it does the thickest Clouds,\r\ncarried me up so high, that at length I found my self above the middle\r\nRegion of the Air. But seeing that Attraction hurried me up with so\r\nmuch rapidity that instead of drawing near the Moon, as I intended,\r\nshe seem'd to me to be more distant than at my first setting out; I\r\nbroke several of my Vials, until I found my weight exceed the force of\r\nthe Attraction, and that I began to descend again towards the Earth.\r\nI was not mistaken in my opinion, for some time after I fell to the\r\nground again; and to reckon from the hour that I set out at, it must\r\nthen have been about midnight. Nevertheless I found the Sun to be in\r\nthe Meridian, and that it was Noon. I leave it to you to judge, in what\r\nAmazement I was; The truth is, I was so strangely surprised, that not\r\nknowing what to think of that Miracle, I had the insolence to imagine\r\nthat in favour of my Boldness God had once more nailed the Sun to the\r\nFirmament, to light so generous[2] an Enterprise. That which encreased\r\nmy Astonishment was, That I knew not the Country where I was; it seemed\r\nto me, that having mounted straight up, I should have fallen down again\r\nin the same place I parted from.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the Equipage I was in, I directed my course towards a\r\nkind of Cottage, where I perceived some smoke; and I was not above a\r\nPistol-shot from it, when I saw my self environed by a great number\r\nof People, stark naked: They seemed to be exceedingly surprised at\r\nthe sight of me; for I was the first, (as I think) that they had\r\never seen clad in Bottles. Nay, and to baffle all the Interpretations\r\nthat they could put upon that Equipage, they perceived that I hardly\r\ntouched the ground as I walked; for, indeed, they understood not that\r\nupon the least agitation I gave my Body the Heat of the beams of the\r\nNoon-Sun raised me up with my Dew; and that if I had had Vials enough\r\nabout me, it would possibly have carried me up into the Air in their\r\nview. I had a mind to have spoken to them; but as if Fear had changed\r\nthem into Birds, immediately I lost sight of them in an adjoyning\r\nForest. However, I catched hold of one, whose Legs had, without doubt,\r\nbetrayed his Heart. I asked him, but with a great deal of pain, (for\r\nI was quite choked) how far they reckoned from thence to _Paris_? How\r\nlong Men had gone naked in _France_? and why they fled from me in so\r\ngreat Consternation? The Man I spoke to was an old tawny Fellow, who\r\npresently fell at my Feet, and with lifted-up Hands joyned behind his\r\nHead, opened his Mouth and shut his Eyes: He mumbled a long while\r\nbetween his Teeth, but I could not distinguish an articulate Word; so\r\nthat I took his Language for the maffling[3] noise of a Dumb-man.\r\n\r\nSome time after, I saw a Company of Souldiers marching, with Drums\r\nbeating; and I perceived Two detached from the rest, to come and take\r\nspeech of me. When they were come within hearing, I asked them, Where I\r\nwas? \"You are in _France_\" answered they: \"But what Devil hath put you\r\ninto that Dress? And how comes it that we know you not? Is the Fleet\r\nthen arrived? Are you going to carry the News of it to the Governor?\r\nAnd why have you divided your Brandy into so many Bottles?\" To all this\r\nI made answer, That the Devil had not put me into that Dress: That they\r\nknew me not; because they could not know all Men: That I knew, nothing\r\nof the _Seine's_ carrying Ships to _Paris_: That I had no news for the\r\n_Marshal de l'Hospital_;[4] and that I was not loaded with Brandy. \"Ho,\r\nho,\" said they to me, taking me by the Arm, \"you are a merry Fellow\r\nindeed; come, the Governor will make a shift to know you, no doubt\r\non't.\"\r\n\r\nThey led me to their Company, where I learnt that I was in reality in\r\n_France_, but that it was in _New-France_: So that some time after, I\r\nwas presented before the Governor, who asked me my Country, my Name and\r\nQuality; and after that I had satisfied him in all Points, and told\r\nhim the pleasant Success of my Voyage, whether he believed it, or only\r\npretended to do so, he had the goodness to order me a Chamber in his\r\nApartment. I was very happy, in meeting with a Man capable of lofty\r\nOpinions, and who was not at all surprised when I told him that the\r\nEarth must needs have turned during my Elevation; seeing that having\r\nbegun to mount about Two Leagues from _Paris_, I was fallen, as it\r\nwere, by a perpendicular Line in _Canada_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Cf. M. Rostand's Cyrano de Bergerac, act III., scene xi.: \"One way\r\nwas to stand naked in the sunshine, in a harness thickly studded with\r\nglass phials, each filled with morning dew. The sun in drawing up the\r\ndew, you see, could not have helped drawing me up too!\" (Miss Gertrude\r\nHall' s translation.)\r\n\r\n[2] Generous = _noble_. Cf. Lord Burleigh, _Precepts to his Son_: \"Let\r\nher not be poor, how _generous_ soever; for a man can buy nothing in\r\nthe market with gentility.\"\r\n\r\n[3] Stammering, mumbling; a North of England word.\r\n\r\n[4] Paul Lacroix, the editor of the French edition of Cyrano's\r\nworks, not understanding this phrase, has ingeniously invented the\r\ninterpretation of \"quarantine officer\" for it. Not only have the words\r\nnever had this meaning, but they are evidently a proper name. And in\r\nfact _François de l'Hospital, Maréchal de France_, was Governor of\r\nParis in 1649, the year when the _Voyage to the Moon_ was probably\r\nwritten. Cyrano, thinking he has fallen in France, near Paris, and\r\nbeing asked if he carries news of the fleet to the Governor, naturally\r\nanswers that he knows nothing of ships going to Paris, and that he\r\ncarries no news to the Maréchal de l'Hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of his Conversation with the Vice-Roy of New France; and of the system\r\nof this Universe._\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I was going to Bed at night, he came into my Chamber, and spoke\r\nto me to this purpose: \"I should not have come to disturb your Rest,\r\nhad I not thought that one who hath found out the secret of Travelling\r\nso far in Twelve hours space, had likewise a charm against Lassitude.\r\nBut you know not,\" added he, \"what a pleasant Quarrel I have just now\r\nhad with our Fathers, upon your account? They'll have you absolutely\r\nto be a Magician; and the greatest favour you can expect from them, is\r\nto be reckoned only an Impostor: The truth is, that Motion which you\r\nattribute to the Earth[1] is a pretty nice Paradox; and for my part\r\nI'll frankly tell you, That that which hinders me from being of your\r\nOpinion, is, That though you parted yesterday from _Paris_, yet you\r\nmight have arrived today in this Country without the Earth's turning:\r\nFor the Sun having drawn you up by the means of your Bottles, ought he\r\nnot to have brought you hither; since according to _Ptolemy_, and the\r\nModern Philosophers,[2] he marches obliquely, as you make the Earth to\r\nmove? And besides, what great Probability have you to imagine, that the\r\nSun is immoveable, when we see it go? And what appearance is there,\r\nthat the Earth turns with so great Rapidity, when we feel it firm under\r\nour Feet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" replied I to him, \"These are, in a manner, the Reasons that\r\noblige us to think so: In the first place, it is consonant to common\r\nSense to think that the Sun is placed in the Center of the Universe;\r\nseeing all Bodies in nature standing in need of that radical Heat, it\r\nis fit he should reside in the heart of the Kingdom, that he may be\r\nin a condition readily to supply the Necessities of every Part; and\r\nthat the Cause of Generations should be placed in the middle of all\r\nBodies, that it may act there with greater Equality and Ease: After\r\nthe same manner as Wise Nature hath placed the Seeds in the Center of\r\nApples, the Kernels in the middle of their Fruits; and in the same\r\nmanner as the Onion, under the cover of so many Coats that encompass\r\nit, preserves that precious Bud from which Millions of others are to\r\nhave their being. For an Apple is in itself a little Universe; the\r\nSeed, hotter than the other parts thereof, is its Sun, which diffuses\r\nabout it self that natural Heat which preserves its Globe: And in the\r\nOnion, the Germ is the little Sun of that little World, which vivifies\r\nand nourishes the vegetative Salt of that little mass. Having laid down\r\nthis, then, for a ground, I say, That the Earth standing in need of the\r\nLight, Heat, and Influence of this great Fire, it turns round it, that\r\nit may receive in all parts alike that Virtue which keeps it in Being.\r\nFor it would be as ridiculous to think, that that vast luminous Body\r\nturned about a point that it has not the least need of; as to imagine,\r\nthat when we see a roasted Lark, that the Kitchin-fire must have turned\r\nround it. Else, were it the part of the Sun to do that drudgery, it\r\nwould seem that the Physician stood in need of the Patient; that the\r\nStrong should yield to the Weak; the Superior serve the Inferior; and\r\nthat the Ship did not sail about the Land, but the Land about the Ship.\r\n\r\n\"Now if you cannot easily conceive how so ponderous a Body can move;\r\nPray, tell me, are the Stars and Heavens, which, in your Opinion, are\r\nso solid, any way lighter? Besides, it is not so difficult for us, who\r\nare assured of the Roundness of the Earth, to infer its motion from its\r\nFigure: But why do ye suppose the Heaven to be round, seeing you cannot\r\nknow it, and that yet, if it hath not this Figure, it is impossible it\r\ncan move? I object not to you your _Excentricks_ nor _Epicycles_,[3]\r\nwhich you cannot explain but very confusedly, and which are out of\r\ndoors in my Systeme. Let's reflect only on the natural Causes of that\r\nMotion. To make good your Hypothesis, you are forced to have recourse\r\nto Spirits or _Intelligences_, that move and govern your Spheres. But\r\nfor my part, without disturbing the repose of the supreme Being, who,\r\nwithout doubt, hath made Nature entirely perfect, and whose Wisdom\r\nought so to have compleated her, that being perfect in one thing, she\r\nshould not have been defective in another: I say, that the Beams and\r\nInfluences of the Sun, darting Circularly upon the Earth, make it to\r\nturn as with a turn of the Hand we make a Globe to move; or, which is\r\nmuch the same, that the Steams which continually evaporate from that\r\nside of it which the Sun shines upon, being reverberated by the Cold\r\nof the middle Region, rebound upon it, and striking obliquely do of\r\nnecessity make it whirle about in that manner.\r\n\r\n\"The Explication of the other Motions[4] is less perplexed still; for\r\npray, consider a little\" At these words the Vice-Roy interrupted me: \"I\r\nhad rather,\" said he, \"you would excuse your self from that trouble;\r\nfor I have read some Books of _Gassendus_[5] on that subject: And hear\r\nwhat one of our Fathers, who maintained your Opinion one day, answered\r\nme. 'Really,' said he, 'I fancy that the Earth does move, not for the\r\nReasons alledged by _Copernicus_; but because Hell-fire being shut up\r\nin the Center of the Earth, the damned, who make a great bustle to\r\navoid its Flames, scramble up to the Vault, as far as they can from\r\nthem, and so make the Earth to turn, as a Turn-spit[6] makes the Wheel\r\ngo round when he runs about in it.'\"\r\n\r\nWe applauded that Thought, as being a pure effect of the Zeal of that\r\ngood Father: And then the Vice-Roy told me, That he much wondered,\r\nhow the Systeme of _Ptolemy_, being so improbable, should have been\r\nso universally received. \"Sir,\" said I to him, \"most part of Men, who\r\njudge of all things by the Senses, have suffered themselves to be\r\nperswaded by their Eyes; and as he who Sails along a Shoar thinks the\r\nShip immoveable, and the Land in motion; even so Men turning with the\r\nEarth round the Sun have thought that it was the Sun that moved about\r\nthem. To this may be added the unsupportable Pride of Mankind, who\r\nperswade themselves that Nature hath only been made for them; as if\r\nit were likely that the Sun, a vast Body Four hundred and thirty four\r\ntimes bigger than the Earth,[7] had only been kindled to ripen their\r\nMedlars and plumpen their Cabbage.\r\n\r\n\"For my part, I am so far from complying with their Insolence, that\r\nI believe the Planets are Worlds about the Sun, and that the fixed\r\nStars are also Suns which have Planets about them, that's to say,\r\nWorlds, which because of their smallness, and that their borrowed light\r\ncannot reach us, are not discernable by Men in this World: For in good\r\nearnest, how can it be imagined that such spacious Globes are no more\r\nbut vast Desarts; and that ours, because we live in it, hath been\r\nframed for the habitation of a dozen of proud Dandyprats? How, must it\r\nbe said, because the Sun measures our Days and Years, that it hath only\r\nbeen made to keep us from running our Heads against the Walls? No, no,\r\nif that visible Deity shine upon Man, it's by accident, as the King's\r\nFlamboy by accident lightens a Porter that walks along the Street.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said he to me, \"[if,] as you affirm, the fixed Stars be so\r\nmany Suns, it will follow that the World is infinite; seeing it is\r\nprobable that the People of that World which moves about that fixed\r\nStar you take for a Sun, discover above themselves other fixed Stars,\r\nwhich we cannot perceive from hence, and so others in that manner _in\r\ninfinitum_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never question,\" replied I, \"but as God could create the Soul\r\nImmortal, He could also make the World Infinite; if so it be, that\r\nEternity is nothing else but an illimited Duration, and an infinite, a\r\nboundless Extension: And then God himself would be Finite, supposing\r\nthe World not to be _infinite_; seeing he cannot be where nothing is,\r\nand that he could not encrease the greatness of the World without\r\nadding somewhat to his own Being, by beginning to exist where he did\r\nnot exist before. We must believe then, that as from hence we see\r\n_Saturn_ and _Jupiter_; if we were in either of the Two, we should\r\ndiscover a great many Worlds which we perceive not; and that the\r\nUniverse extends so _in infinitum_.\"\r\n\r\n\"I' faith;\" replied he, \"when you have said all you can, I cannot at\r\nall comprehend that Infinitude.\" \"Good now,\" replied I to him, \"do\r\nyou comprehend the Nothing that is beyond it? Not at all. For when\r\nyou think of that _Nothing_, you imagine it at least to be like Wind\r\nor Air, and that is a Being: But if you conceive not an _Infinite_ in\r\ngeneral, you comprehend it at least in particulars; seeing it is not\r\ndifficult to fancy to our selves, beyond the Earth, Air, and Fire which\r\nwe see, other Air, and other Earth, and other Fire. Now Infinitude\r\nis nothing else but a boundless Series of all these. But if you ask\r\nme, How these Worlds have been made, seeing Holy Scripture speaks\r\nonly of one that God made? My answer is, That I have no more to say:\r\nFor to oblige me to give a Reason for every thing that comes into my\r\nImagination, is to stop my Mouth, and make me confess that in things of\r\nthat nature my Reason shall always stoop to Faith.\"\r\n\r\nHe ingeniously[8] acknowledged to me that his Question was to be\r\ncensured, but bid me pursue my notion: So that I went on, and told\r\nhim, That all the other Worlds, which are not seen, or but imperfectly\r\nbelieved, are no more but the Scum that purges out of the Suns. For how\r\ncould these great Fires subsist without some matter, that served them\r\nfor Fewel? Now as the Fire drives from it the Ashes that would stifle\r\nit, or the Gold in a Crucible separates from the Marcasite[9] and\r\nDross, and is refined to the highest Standard; nay, and as our Stomack\r\ndischarges it self by vomit, of the Crudities that oppress it; even\r\nso these Suns daily evacuate, and reject the Remains of matter that\r\nmight incommode their Fire: But when they have wholly consumed that\r\nmatter which entertains[10] them; you are not to doubt, but they spread\r\nthemselves abroad on all sides to seek for fresh Fewel, and fasten upon\r\nthe Worlds which heretofore they have made, and particularly upon those\r\nthat are nearest: Then these great Fires, reconcocting all the Bodies,\r\nwill as formerly force them out again, Pell-mell, from all parts; and\r\nbeing by little and little purified, they'll begin to serve for Suns to\r\nother little Worlds, which they procreate by driving them out of their\r\nSpheres: And that without doubt, made the _Pythagoreans_ foretel the\r\nuniversal Conflagration.\r\n\r\n\"This is no ridiculous Imagination, for _New-France_ where we\r\nare, gives us a very convincing instance of it. The vast Continent\r\nof _America_ is one half of the Earth, which in spight of our\r\nPredecessors, who a Thousand times had cruised the Ocean, was not\r\nat that time discovered: Nor, indeed, was it then in being, no more\r\nthan a great many Islands, Peninsules, and Mountains that have since\r\nstarted up in our Globe, when the Sun purged out its Excrements to a\r\nconvenient distance, and of a sufficient Gravity to be attracted by the\r\nCenter of our World; either in small Particles, perhaps, or, it may\r\nbe also, altogether in one lump. That is not so unreasonable but that\r\n_St. Austin_[11] would have applauded to it, if that Country had been\r\ndiscovered in his Age. Seeing that great Man, who had a very clear Wit,\r\nassures us, That in his time the Earth was flat like the floor of an\r\nOven, and that it floated upon the Water, like the half of an Orange:\r\nBut if ever I have the honour to see you in _France_, I'll make you\r\nobserve, by means of a most excellent Celescope, that some Obscurities,\r\nwhich from hence appear to be Spots, are Worlds a forming.\"\r\n\r\nMy Eyes that shut with this Discourse, obliged the Vice-Roy to\r\nwithdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] In connection with this discussion it is to be remembered that\r\nnearly two centuries were required for the Copernican system,\r\npromulgated in 1543, in the De orbium _coelestium revolutionibus_, to\r\nbecome generally popularized; and that in 1633, only sixteen years\r\nbefore the _Voyage to the Moon_ was written, Galileo had been compelled\r\nby the Inquisition to deny the motion of the earth.\r\n\r\n[2] According to the Ptolemaic system, still generally accepted by\r\n\"modern Philosophers\" at the time of Cyrano's writing, the fixed stars,\r\nthe sun, the moon, and each of the five (then known) planets, revolved\r\nabout the earth in different orbits, according to various \"epicycles\"\r\nand \"excentrics.\"\r\n\r\n[3] The motion of the moon, for instance, was explained in the\r\nPtolemaic system as an epicycle carried by an excentric; the centre of\r\nthe excentric moving about the earth in a direction opposite to that of\r\nthe epicycle.\r\n\r\n[4] The French has: \"of the _two_ other motions\": _i.e._, the movement\r\nof the fixed stars, and that of the planets.\r\n\r\n[5] _Gassendus_ or _Gassendi_ was Cyrano's own teacher of Philosophy.\r\nOf Provençal origin, and at first Professor in the University of Aix,\r\nhe came to Paris in 1641, and gave both private lessons and public\r\ncourses as Professor of the Collège Royal. It was in one of his private\r\nclasses that Cyrano was a fellow-student with Chapelle, Hesnaut,\r\nBernier, and almost certainly Molière; the most important group of\r\nyoung \"libertins\" (_i.e._ free-thinkers) of the epoch.\r\n\r\nGassendi was a bitter opponent of the supposedly Aristotelian\r\nschool-philosophy of the time; and was on the whole the leader of\r\nthose who in the seventeenth century followed Epicurean methods in\r\nthought. He is the author of a life of Epicurus, and an exposition\r\nof his philosophy. He was also an opponent of Descartes, being the\r\nmost important contemporary supporter of empiricism as against the\r\nessentially idealistic method of Descartes.\r\n\r\nHe is important also as a popularizer of the Copernican system, by his\r\nLife of Copernicus, and his _Institutio Astronomica_ (1647).\r\n\r\n[6] A dog trained to turn a spit, by running about in a rotary cage\r\nattached to it. The French has simply: \"as a _dog_ makes a wheel turn,\r\nwhen he runs about in it.\"\r\n\r\n[7] Cyrano had probably learned this from his master Gassendi. _Cf_.\r\nhis \"Epistola XX. de apparente magnitudine solis,\" 1641. Modern\r\nGassendis say the sun is 1,300,000 times greater than the earth in\r\nvolume, 316,000 times in mass.\r\n\r\n[8] _Ingenuously_.

I had made a Machine which I\r\nfancied might carry me up as high as I pleased, so that nothing seeming\r\nto be wanting to it, I placed my self within, and from the Top of a\r\nRock threw my self in the Air: But because I had not taken my measures\r\naright, I fell with a sosh in the Valley below.\r\n\r\nBruised as I was, however, I returned to my Chamber without loosing\r\ncourage, and with Beef-Marrow I anointed my Body, for I was all over\r\nmortified from Head to Foot: Then having taken a dram of Cordial Waters\r\nto strengthen my Heart, I went back to look for my Machine; but I could\r\nnot find it, for some Soldiers, that had been sent into the Forest to\r\ncut wood for a Bonnefire, meeting with it by chance, had carried it\r\nwith them to the Fort: Where after a great deal of guessing what it\r\nmight be, when they had discovered the invention of the Spring, some\r\nsaid, that a good many Fire-Works should be fastened to it, because\r\ntheir Force carrying them up on high, and the Machine playing its large\r\nWings, no Body but would take it for a Fiery Dragon. In the mean time\r\nI was long in search of it, but found it at length in the Market-place\r\nof Kebeck (Quebec), just as they were setting Fire to it. I was so\r\ntransported with Grief, to find the Work of my Hands in so great Peril,\r\nthat I ran to the Souldier that was giving Fire to it, caught hold of\r\nhis Arm, pluckt the Match out of his Hand, and in great rage threw\r\nmy self into my Machine, that I might undo the Fire-Works that they\r\nhad stuck about it; but I came too late, for hardly were both my Feet\r\nwithin, when whip, away went I up in a Cloud.\r\n\r\nThe Horror and Consternation I was in did not so confound the faculties\r\nof my Soul, but I have since remembered all that happened to me at that\r\ninstant. For so soon as the Flame had devoured one tier of Squibs,\r\nwhich were ranked by six and six, by means of a Train that reached\r\nevery half-dozen, another tier went off, and then another;[2] so that\r\nthe Salt-Peter taking Fire, put off the danger by encreasing it.\r\nHowever, all the combustible matter being spent, there was a period put\r\nto the Fire-work; and whilst I thought of nothing less than to knock\r\nmy Head against the top of some Mountain, I felt, without the least\r\nstirring, my elevation continuing; and adieu Machine, for I saw it fall\r\ndown again towards the Earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CYRANO en route FOR THE MOON.--From a 17th Century\r\nEngraving.]\r\n\r\nThat extraordinary Adventure puffed up my Heart with so uncommon a\r\nGladness; that, ravished to see my self delivered from certain danger,\r\nI had the impudence to philosophize upon it. Whilst then with Eyes and\r\nThought I cast about to find what might be the cause of it, I perceived\r\nmy flesh blown up, and still greasy with the Marrow, that I had daubed\r\nmy self over with for the Bruises of my fall: I knew that the Moon\r\nbeing then in the Wain, and that it being usual for her in that Quarter\r\nto suck up the Marrow of Animals, she drank up that wherewith I was\r\nanointed, with so much the more force that her Globe was nearer to me,\r\nand that no interposition of Clouds weakened her Attraction.[3]\r\n\r\nWhen I had, according to the computation I made since, advanced a good\r\ndeal more than three quarters of the space that divided the Earth from\r\nthe Moon; all of a sudden I fell with my Heels up and Head down, though\r\nI had made no Trip; and indeed, I had not been sensible of it, had not\r\nI felt my Head loaded under the weight of my Body: The truth is, I knew\r\nvery well that I was not falling again towards our World; for though I\r\nfound my self to be betwixt two Moons, and easily observed, that the\r\nnearer I drew to the one, the farther I removed from the other; yet I\r\nwas certain, that ours was the bigger Globe of the two: Because after\r\none or two days Journey, the remote Refractions of the Sun, confounding\r\nthe diversity of Bodies and Climates, it appeared to me only as a\r\nlarge Plate of Gold: That made me imagine, that I byassed[4] towards\r\nthe Moon; and I was confirmed in that Opinion, when I began to call to\r\nmind, that I did not fall till I was past three quarters of the way.\r\nFor, said I to my self, that Mass being less than ours, the Sphere of\r\nits Activity must be of less Extent also; and by consequence, it was\r\nlater before I felt the force of its Center.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The Feast of St. John the Baptist, June 24.\r\n\r\n[2] _Cf_. the play of _Cyrano de Bergerac_, act III., scene xi.:\r\n\"Or else, mechanic as well as artificer, I could have fashioned a\r\ngiant grasshopper, with steel joints, which, impelled by successive\r\nexplosions of saltpetre, would have hopped with me to the azure meadows\r\nwhere graze the starry flocks.\"\r\n\r\n[3] _Cf_., in the play, the fifth of Cyrano's means for scaling the\r\nsky: \"Since Phoebe, the moon-goddess, when she is at wane, is greedy, O\r\nbeeves! of your marrow,... with that marrow have besmeared myself!\"\r\n\r\n[4] The translator has apparently misread _biaisais_ where the French\r\neditions have _baissais_: _i.e._, I _was descending_ toward the moon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of his Arrival there, and of the Beauty of that Country in which he\r\nfell._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn fine, after I had been a very long while in falling, as I judged,\r\nfor the violence of my Precipitation hindered me from observing it more\r\nexactly: The last thing I can remember is, that I found my self under\r\na Tree, entangled with three or four pretty large Branches which I had\r\nbroken off by my fall; and my face besmeared with an Apple, that had\r\ndashed against it.\r\n\r\nBy good luck that place was, as you shall know by and by * * * * * *[1]\r\nthat you may very well conclude, that had it not been for that Chance,\r\nif I had had a thousand lives, they had been all lost. I have many\r\ntimes since reflected upon the vulgar Opinion, That if one precipitate\r\nhimself from a very high place, his breath is out before he reach the\r\nground; and from my adventure I conclude it to be false, or else that\r\nthe efficacious Juyce of that Fruit,[2] which squirted into my mouth,\r\nmust needs have recalled my soul, that was not far from my Carcass,\r\nwhich was still hot and in a disposition of exerting the Functions of\r\nLife. The truth is, so soon as I was upon the ground my pain was gone,\r\nbefore I could think what it was; and the Hunger, which I felt during\r\nmy Voyage, was fully satisfied with the sense that I had lost it.[3]\r\n\r\nWhen I was got up, I had hardly taken notice of the largest of Four\r\ngreat Rivers, which by their conflux make a Lake; when the Spirit, or\r\ninvisible Soul, of Plants that breath upon that Country, refreshed my\r\nBrain with a delightful smell: And I found that the Stones there were\r\nneither hard nor rough; but that they carefully softened themselves\r\nwhen one trode upon them.\r\n\r\n[4] I presently lighted upon a Walk with five Avenues, in figure like\r\nto a Star; the Trees whereof seemed to reach up to the Skie, a green\r\nplot of lofty Boughs: Casting up my Eyes from the root to the top, and\r\nthen making the same Survey downwards, I was in doubt whether the Earth\r\ncarried them, or they the Earth, hanging by their Roots: Their high and\r\nstately Forehead seemed also to bend, as it were by force, under the\r\nweight of the Celestial Globes; and one would say, that their Sighs and\r\nout-stretched Arms, wherewith they embraced the Firmament, demanded of\r\nthe Stars the bounty of their purer Influences before they had lost\r\nany thing of their Innocence in the contagious Bed of the Elements.\r\nThe Flowers there on all hands, without the aid of any other Gardiner\r\nbut Nature, send out so sweet (though wild) a Perfume, that it rouzes\r\nand delights the Smell: There the incarnate of a Rose upon the Bush,\r\nand the lively Azure of a Violet under the Rushes, captivating the\r\nChoice, make each of themselves to be judged the Fairest: There the\r\nwhole Year is Spring; there no poysonous Plant sprouts forth, but is\r\nas soon destroyed; there the Brooks by an agreeable murmuring, relate\r\ntheir Travels to the Pebbles; there Thousands of Quiristers make the\r\nWoods resound with their melodious Notes; and the quavering Clubs of\r\nthese divine Musicians are so universal, that every Leaf of the Forest\r\nseems to have borrowed the Tongue and shape of a Nightingale; nay, and\r\nthe Nymph _Eccho_ is so delightful[5] with their Airs, that to hear her\r\nrepeat, one would say, She were sollicitous to learn them. On the sides\r\nof that Wood are Two Meadows, whose continued Verdure seems an Emerauld\r\nreaching out of sight. The various Colours, which the Spring bestows\r\nupon the numerous little Flowers that grow there, so delightfully\r\nconfounds and mingles their Shadows, that it is hard to be known,\r\nwhether these Flowers shaken with a gentle Breeze pursue themselves,\r\nor fly rather from the Caresses of the Wanton _Zephyrus_; one would\r\nlikewise take that Meadow for an Ocean, because, as the Sea, it\r\npresents no Shoar to the view; insomuch, that mine Eye fearing it might\r\nlose it self, having roamed so long, and discovered no Coast, sent my\r\nThoughts presently thither; and my Thoughts, imagining it to be the end\r\nof the World, were willing to be perswaded, that such charming places\r\nhad perhaps forced the Heavens to descend and join the Earth there. In\r\nthe midst of that vast and pleasant Carpet, a rustick Fountain bubbles\r\nup in Silver Purles, crowning its enamelled Banks with Sets of Violets,\r\nand multitudes of other little Flowers, that seem to strive which shall\r\nfirst behold it self in that Chrystal Myrroir: It is as yet in the\r\nCradle, being but newly Born, and its Young and smooth Face shews not\r\nthe least Wrinkle. The large Compasses it fetches, in circling within\r\nit self, demonstrate its unwillingness to leave its native Soyl: And as\r\nif it had been ashamed to be caressed in presence of its Mother, with a\r\nMurmuring it thrust back my hand that would have touched it: The Beasts\r\nthat came to drink there, more rational than those of our World, seemed\r\nsurprised to see it day upon the Horizon, whilst the Sun was with the\r\n_Antipodes_; and durst not bend downwards upon the Brink, for fear of\r\nfalling into the Firmament.\r\n\r\nI must confess to you, That at the sight of so many Fine things, I\r\nfound my self tickled with these agreeable Twitches, which they say the\r\n_Embryo_ feels upon the infusion of its Soul: My old Hair fell off, and\r\ngave place for thicker and softer Locks: I perceived my Youth revived,\r\nmy face grow ruddy, my natural Heat mingle gently again with my radical\r\nMoisture: And in a word, I grew younger again by at least Fourteen\r\nYears.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] \"That place was,\" unquestionably, the Garden of Eden, which Cyrano\r\nheretically locates in the Moon; and the \"Tree\" turough which he has\r\nfallen, and an \"Apple\" of which has besmeared his face and recalled him\r\nto life, is the Tree of Life, that stood \"in the midst of the garden.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the first of a series of hiatuses, which occur in all the\r\nFrench editions as well as the English, and which are marked by those\r\nstars that Cyrano refers to in the play: \"But I intend setting all\r\nthis down in a book, and the golden stars I have brought back caught\r\nin my shaggy mantle, when the book is printed, will be seen serving as\r\nasterisks.\"\r\n\r\nLebret speaks of these gaps in his preface, saying he would have tried\r\nto fill them but for fear of mixing his style with Cyrano's: \"For the\r\nmelancholy colour of my style will not let me imitate the gayety of\r\nhis; nor can my Wit follow the fine flights of his Imagination.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems altogether improbable, however, that Cyrano himself left\r\nthe work thus incomplete, as Lebret would imply. And in fact we can\r\nsupply from a Manuscript recently acquired (1890) by the _Bibliothèque\r\nNationale_, a long passage not printed by Lebret (see pp. 60 ff.*).\r\nThere can be little doubt that the passages were deliberately _cut out_\r\nby some one on account of their \"heretical\" character. It even seems\r\nprobable, from passages at the beginning of the _Voyage to the Sun_,\r\nthat when the work was circulated in Manuscript, Cyrano had been the\r\nobject of persecution on account of them.\r\n\r\n(*search: start p. 60: \"the Earth, I threw out my Bowl...\")\r\n\r\nThe passages lacking were cut out then but by whom? The usually\r\naccepted opinion is that of our English translator, who says the gaps\r\nare \"occasioned, not by the Negligence of our Witty French Author, but\r\nby the accursed Plagiary of some rude Hand, that in his sickness rifted\r\nhis Trunks and stole his Papers, as he himself complains.\" M. Brun has\r\nsuggested, however, and with some plausibility, that Lebret himself\r\nwas responsible for the omissions; and that he thus continued, after\r\nCyrano's death, his lifelong attempts at reforming and toning down\r\nthe impolitic, unorthodox notions of his too-independent friend. So\r\nCyrano was conquered once more in his battle with \"les Compromis, les\r\nPréjugés, les Lâchètes,\" and finally \"la Sottise\":\r\n\r\n    \"Je sais bien qu' à la fin vous me mettrez à bas;\r\n    N'importe! je me bats, je me bats, je me bats!\"\r\n\r\nWe are proud of printing for the first time in any edition of the\r\n_Voyage to the Moon_, at least a part of what had been cut out; and\r\nof being able to indicate for the first time what must have been the\r\nsubstance of the other lost passages, and what is the sense of the\r\nfragments preserved.\r\n\r\n[2] The Apple of the Tree of Life.\r\n\r\n[3] The translation is not fully adequate here; the French means: \"...\r\nwas fully satisfied, and left me in its place only a slight memory of\r\nhaving lost it.\"\r\n\r\n[4] This beautiful Nature-description, the like of which cannot be\r\nfound in all seventeenth-century French literature outside of Cyrano's\r\nworks, was apparently his favorite passage, since it is the only one he\r\nhas used twice. _Cf_. his _Lettre XI_., \"D'une maison de campagne.\"\r\n\r\n[5] In the literal sense, _full of delight_, delighted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of a Youth whom he met there, and of their Conversation: what that\r\ncountry was, and the Inhabitants of it._\r\n\r\n\r\nI had advanced half a League, through a Forest of Jessamines and\r\nMyrtles, when I perceived something that stirred, lying in the Shade:\r\nIt was a Youth, whose Majestick Beauty forced me almost to Adoration.\r\nHe started up to hinder me; crying, \"It is not to me but to God that\r\nyou owe these Humilities.\" \"You see one,\" answered I, \"stunned with so\r\nmany Wonders that I know not what to admire most; for coming from a\r\nWorld, which without doubt you take for a Moon here, I thought I had\r\narrived in another, which our Worldlings call a Moon also; and behold I\r\nam in Paradice at the Feet of a God, who will not be Adored.\" \"Except\r\nthe quality[1] of a God,\" replied he, \"whose Creature I only am, the\r\nrest you say is true: This Land is the Moon, which you see from your\r\nGlobe, and this place where you are is * * * * * * * * \"[2]\r\n\r\n\"Now at that time Man's Imagination was so strong, as not being as\r\nyet corrupted, neither by Debauches, the Crudity of Aliments, nor the\r\nalterations of Diseases, that being excited by a violent desire of\r\ncoming to this Sanctuary, and his Body becoming light through the heat\r\nof this Inspiration; he was carried thither in the same manner, as some\r\nPhilosophers, who having fixed their Imagination upon the contemplation\r\nof a certain Object have sprung up in the Air by Ravishments, which\r\nyou call Extasies. The Woman, who through the infirmity of her Sex was\r\nweaker and less hot, could not, without doubt, have the imagination\r\nstrong enough to make the Intension of her Will prevail over the\r\nPonderousness of her Matter; but because there were very few * * * *\r\nthe Sympathy which still united that half to its whole,[3] drew her\r\ntowards him as he mounted up, as the Amber attracts the Straw, [as] the\r\nLoad-stone turns towards the North from whence it hath been taken, and\r\ndrew to him that part of himself, as the Sea draws the Rivers which\r\nproceed from it. When they arrived in your Earth, they dwelt betwixt\r\n_Mesopotamia_ and _Arabia_:[4] Some People knew them by the name of * *\r\n* *,[5] and others under that of _Prometheus_, whom the Poets feigned\r\nto have stolen Fire from Heaven, by reason of his Offspring, who were\r\nendowed with a Soul as perfect as his own: So that to inhabit your\r\nWorld, that Man left this destitute; but the All-wise would not have so\r\nblessed an Habitation, to remain without Inhabitants; He suffered a few\r\nages after that * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\r\n* *[6] cloyed with the company of Men, whose Innocence was corrupted,\r\nhad a desire to forsake them. This person,[7] however, thought no\r\nretreat secure enough from the Ambition of Men, who already Murdered\r\none another about the distribution of your World; except that blessed\r\nLand, which his Grand-Father[8] had so often mentioned unto him, and\r\nto which no Body had as yet found out the way: But his Imagination\r\nsupplied that; for seeing he had observed that * * * he filled Two\r\nlarge Vessels which he sealed Hermetically, and fastened them under\r\nhis Armpits: So soon as the Smoak began to rise upwards, and could not\r\npierce through the Mettal, it forced up the Vessels on high, and with\r\nthem also that Great Man.[9] When he was got as high as the Moon, and\r\nhad cast his Eyes upon that lovely Garden, a fit of almost supernatural\r\nJoy convinced him, that that was the place where his Grandfather had\r\nheretofore lived. He quickly untied the Vessels, which he had girt\r\nlike Wings about his Shoulders, and did it so luckily, that he was\r\nscarcely Four Fathom in the Air above the Moon, when he set his Fins a\r\ngoing;[10] yet he was high enough still to have been hurt by the fall,\r\nhad it not been for the large skirts of his Gown, which being swelled\r\nby the Wind, gently upheld him till he set Foot on ground.[11] As for\r\nthe two Vessels, they mounted up to a certain place, where they have\r\ncontinued: And those are they, which now a-days you call the _Balance_.\r\n\r\n\"I must now tell you, the manner how I came hither: I believe you have\r\nnot forgot my name,[12] seeing it is not long since I told it you. You\r\nshall know then, that I lived on the agreeable Banks of one of the\r\nmost renowned Rivers of your World, where amongst my Books, I lead a\r\nLife pleasant enough not to be lamented, though it slipt away fast\r\nenough. In the mean while, the more I encreased in Knowledge, the more\r\nI knew my Ignorance. Our Learned Men never put me in mind of the famous\r\n_Mada_,[13] but the thoughts of his perfect Philosophy made me to Sigh.\r\nI was despairing of being able to attain to it, when one day, after a\r\nlong and profound Studying. I took a piece of Load-stone about two Foot\r\nsquare, which I put into a Furnace; and then after it was well purged,\r\nprecipitated and dissolved, I drew the calcined Attractive of it, and\r\nreduced it into the size of about an ordinary Bowl.[14]\r\n\r\n\"After the Preparations, I got a very light Machine of Iron made,\r\ninto which I went, and when I was well seated in my place, I threw\r\nthis Magnetick Bowl as high as I could up into the Air. Now the Iron\r\nMachine, which I had purposely made more massive in the middle than\r\nat the ends, was presently elevated, and in a just Poise; because the\r\nmiddle received the greatest force of Attraction. So then, as I arrived\r\nat the place whither my Load-stone had attracted me, I presently threw\r\nup my Bowl in the Air over me.\"[15] \"But,\" said I, interrupting him,\r\n\"How came you to heave up your Bowl so streight over your Chariot, that\r\nit never happened to be on one side of it?\" \"That seems to me to be no\r\nwonder at all,\" said he; \"for the Load-stone being once thrown up in\r\nthe Air, drew the Iron streight towards it; and so it was impossible,\r\nthat ever I should mount sideways. Nay more, I can tell you, that when\r\nI held the Bowl in my hand, I was still mounting upwards; because\r\nthe Chariot flew always to the Load-stone, which I held over it. But\r\nthe effort of the Iron to be united to my Bowl, was so violent that\r\nit made my Body bend double; so that I durst but once essay that\r\nnew Experiment. The truth is, it was a very surprizing Spectacle to\r\nbehold; for the Steel of that flying House, which I had very carefully\r\nPolished, reflected on all sides the light of the Sun with so great\r\nlife and lustre, that I thought my self to be all on fire.[16] In\r\nfine, after often Bowling and following of my Cast, I came, as you\r\ndid, to an Elevation from which I descended towards this World; and\r\nbecause at that instant I held my Bowl very fast between my hands,\r\nmy Machine, whereof the Seat pressed me hard, that it might approach\r\nits Attractive, did not forsake me; all that now I feared was, that\r\nI should break my Neck: But to save me from that, ever now and then\r\nI tossed up my Bowl; that by its attractive Virtue it might prevent\r\nthe violent Descent of my Machine, and render my fall more easie, as\r\nindeed it happened; for when I saw my self within Two or three hundred\r\nfathom of the Earth, I threw out my Bowl on all hands, level with the\r\nChariot, sometimes on this side, and sometimes on that, until I came\r\nto a certain Distance; and immediately then, I tossed it up above me;\r\nso that my Machine following it, I left it, and let my self fall on\r\nthe other side, as gently as I could, upon the Sand; insomuch that my\r\nfall was no greater than if it had been but my own height. I shall not\r\ndescribe to you the amazement I was in at the sight of the wonders of\r\nthis place, seeing it was so like the same, wherewith I just now saw\r\nyou seized. [17] You shall know then, that on the morrow I met with the\r\nTree of Life, by the means of which I have kept my self from growing\r\nold; it straightway consumed the Serpent[18] and made him to vanish\r\naway in smoke.\"\r\n\r\nAt these words: \"Venerable and holy patriarch,\" said I to him, \"I am\r\neager to know what you understand by that Serpent which was consumed.\"\r\nHe, with face a smiling, answered me thus:...[19]\r\n\r\n\"The Tree of Knowledge is planted opposite; its fruit is covered with\r\na Rind which produces Ignorance in whomsoever hath tasted thereof; yet\r\nthis Rind preserves underneath its thickness all the spiritual virtues\r\nof this learned food. God, when he had driven Adam from this fortunate\r\ncountry, rubbed his gums with this same Rind, that he might never find\r\nthe way back again; for more than fifteen years thereafter he did dote,\r\nand did so completely forget all things, that neither he nor any of his\r\ndescendants till Moses ever remembered even so much as the Creation;\r\nbut what Power was left of this direful Rind at last passed away\r\nthrough the warmth and brightness of that great Prophet's genius.\r\n\r\n\"I happily met with one among these apples, which through ripeness\r\nwas despoiled of its skin; hardly had my mouth watered with it, when\r\nUniversal Knowledge penetrated my being, I felt as it were an infinite\r\nnumber of Eyes fix themselves in my head, and I knew the means of\r\nspeaking with the Lord.\r\n\r\n\"When I have since reflected on these miraculous events, I have judged\r\nthat I could in no wise have overcome, by any occult powers of a simple\r\nnatural body, the vigilance of that Seraph whom God has ordained to\r\nguard this Paradise; but since he is pleased to use _second causes_, I\r\nimagined that he had inspired me to find this means of entering there;\r\neven as he thought good to take of the ribs of Adam to make him a wife,\r\nthough he could form her of Earth, as well as he did Adam.\r\n\r\n\"I remained long in this Garden, walking about alone; but in fine,\r\nsince the angel that was Keeper of the Gate seemed to me to be in chief\r\nmy Host here, I was taken with the desire to salute him. In an hour's\r\njourney I came to a place where a thousand Lightnings mingled together\r\nin one blinding light that served but to make Darkness visible. I was\r\nnot yet fully recovered from this dazzlement, when I saw before me a\r\nbeautiful Young man. 'I am,' said he, 'the Archangel whom you seek,\r\nI have but now read in God that he had inspired you with the means of\r\ncoming here, and that he willed you should here expect his pleasure.'\r\nHe talked with me of many things, and told me among the rest:\r\n\r\n\"That the light wherewith I had been amazed was nothing fearful, but\r\nthat it appeared almost every evening when he went his rounds, seeing\r\nthat to avoid sudden attack from the Evil Spirits, which may enter\r\nsecretly at any place, he was constrained mightily to swing his Flaming\r\nSword in circles, all about the bounds of the Earthly Paradise; and\r\nthat the light I had seen was the lightnings which the steel of it gave\r\nforth. 'Those also which you perceive from your Earth,' he added, 'are\r\nof my creation. And if sometimes you see them at a great distance, it\r\nis because the clouds of some distant region hold themselves in such\r\ndisposition as to receive an impression of these unbodied fires, and\r\nreflect them to your eyes; just as clouds otherwise disposed may prove\r\nthemselves fit to make the Rainbow.'\r\n\r\n\"I will not instruct you further in these matters, since to be sure the\r\nApple of Knowledge is not far from hence; whereof as soon as you have\r\neaten, you will know all things even as I. But see you make no mistake,\r\nfor most of the Fruits that hang from that Plant are encased in a Rind,\r\nwhose taste will abase you even below man; while the part within will\r\nmake you mount up to be even as the Angels.\"\r\n\r\nElijah had come to this point of the teachings of the Seraph, when\r\na little short man came up with us; \"This is that Enoch of whom I\r\ntold you,\" said my guide to me apart; and even while he finished\r\nthe words, Enoch offered us a basketful of I know not what fruits,\r\nlike to Pomegranates, which he had but discovered that same day in a\r\ndistant coppice. I took some and put in my pockets, as Elijah bade me.\r\nHere-upon Enoch asked him who I might be. \"That is a matter,\" answered\r\nmy guide, \"to entertain us at more leisure; this evening when we have\r\nwithdrawn he shall tell us himself of the miraculous particulars of his\r\njourney.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words we arrived beneath a sort of Hermitage, made of\r\npalm-branches skilfully interlaced with myrtle and orange-branches.\r\nThere I saw, in a little nook, great piles of a kind of floss-silk, so\r\nwhite and so delicate that one might take it for the virgin Soul of\r\nthe snow; and I saw distaffs lying here and there; whereupon I asked\r\nmy guide what use they served. \"To spin,\" he answered me; \"when the\r\ngood Enoch would relax his mind from meditation, he applies himself\r\nsometimes to dressing this Lady-distaff, sometimes to weaving the cloth\r\nfrom which they make Shifts for the eleven thousand Virgins. Surely\r\nin your world you have met with that something white, which flutters\r\non the winds in Autumn about the season of the Winter-sowings. Your\r\npeasant-folk call it Our Lady's Cotton, but it is no other than the\r\nFlock that Enoch purges his Linen of, when he cards it.\"\r\n\r\nWe made little delay there, and but barely took leave of Enoch, whom\r\nthis cabin served for his Cell; in truth what made us leave him so soon\r\nwas this: that he said some prayer there every six hours; and it was at\r\nleast that time since he had finished the last one.\r\n\r\nAs we went forward, I begged Elijah to finish that history which he had\r\nbegun, of the _Assumptions_ or _Translations_; and I said, that he had\r\ncome, I thought, to that of Saint _John_ the Evangelist.\r\n\r\nThen said he to me: \"Since you have not the patience, to wait till the\r\nApple of Knowledge teach you all these things better than I can, I will\r\neven tell you. Know then that God----\"\r\n\r\nAt this word, in some way I know not how, the Devil would have his\r\nFinger in that pie; or howsoever it came about, so it was that I could\r\nnot forbear Interrupting him with raillery.\r\n\r\n\"I remember that case,\" said I: \"God heard one day that the Soul of the\r\nEvangelist was so loosed from his Body, that he no more kept it in but\r\nby shutting his teeth hard; and at that moment the hour when he had\r\nforeseen that he should be translated hither was almost past; so having\r\nno time to get him a machine made ready for coming, He was constrained\r\nto make him suddenly _be_ here, without having time to _bring_ him.\"\r\n\r\nDuring all my discourse Elijah bent upon me such a look, as would have\r\nbeen fit to kill me, had I then been capable of dying from aught but\r\nHunger. \"Thou Wretch,\" said he, and drew back in horror, \"thou hast\r\nthe insolence to rail at Holy Things! Surely thou shouldst not go\r\nunpunished, were it not that the All-wise determines to spare thee as\r\na marvellous example of His long-suffering, a witness to the Nations.\r\nGet hence, thou Blasphemer, go thou and publish in this little World,\r\nand in the other (for thou art predestined to return thither), the\r\nunforgetting Hatred that God bears to Atheists.\"\r\n\r\nHardly had he finished this Curse, when he seized me roughly to drag\r\nme toward the Gate. When we were arrived beside a great Tree whose\r\nbranches bent almost to Earth with the burden of their Fruit, \"Here,\"\r\nsaid he, \"is that Tree of Knowledge where thou shouldst have got\r\nEnlightenment inconceivable, but for thy Infidelity.\"\r\n\r\nAt that word I feigned to swoon with weakness, and letting my self fall\r\nagainst a low branch I handily filched an Apple from it. And in but a\r\nfew strides more I was set down outside of that delicious Garden.\r\n\r\nIn that moment, being so violently pressed by Hunger, that I even\r\nforgot I was in the grip of the angry Prophet, I drew from my pocket\r\none of those Apples I had filled it with, wherein I buried my teeth as\r\ndeep as I could. But so it was, that in place of taking one of those\r\nEnoch had given me, my hand fell on that very Apple I had plucked from\r\nthe Tree of Knowledge, which for my misfortune I had not freed of its\r\nRind.]\r\n\r\n[20] Scarcely had I tasted it, when a thick Cloud overcast my Soul:\r\nI saw no body now near me; and in the whole Hemisphere my Eyes could\r\nnot discern the least Tract of the way I had made; yet nevertheless I\r\nfully remembered every thing that befel me. When I reflected since upon\r\nthat Miracle, I fanced that the skin of the Fruit which I bit had not\r\nrendered me altogether brutish; because my Teeth piercing through it\r\nwere a little moistened by the Juyce within, the efficacy whereof had\r\ndissipated the Malignities of the Rind. I was not a little surprised to\r\nsee my self all alone, in a Country I knew not. It was to no purpose\r\nfor me to stare and look about me; for no Creature appeared to comfort\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] \"Quality\" = _title_--as often in the seventeenth century; _cf_.\r\nShakspere, _Henry V_.:\r\n\r\n    \"Gentlemen of blood and quality.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[2] Probably a long passage has been lost here, in which the \"Youth\"\r\n(the Prophet Elijah, who had \"translated\" himself hither and become\r\nyoung by eating of the Tree of Life) describes the place where they\r\nare as the original Garden of Eden; and tells of the Creation, the\r\nFall, and the Banishment of Adam and Eve.

She\r\nfavourably granted my desire; for within half a quarter of a League,\r\nI met two huge Animals, one of which stopt before me, and the other\r\nfled swiftly to its Den; for so I thought at least; because that some\r\ntime after, I perceived it come back again in company of above Seven\r\nor Eight hundred of the same kind, who beset me. When I could discern\r\nthem at a near distance, I perceived that they were proportioned and\r\nshaped like us. This adventure brought into my mind the old Wives Tales\r\nof my Nurse concerning _Syrenes, Faunes_ and _Satyrs_: Ever now and\r\nthen they raised such furious Shouts, occasioned undoubtedly by their\r\nAdmiration[1] at the sight of me, that I thought I was e'en turned a\r\nMonster. At length one of these Beast-like men, catching hold of me by\r\nthe Neck, just as Wolves do when they carry away Sheep, tossed me upon\r\nhis back and brought me into their Town; where I was more amazed than\r\nbefore, when I knew they were Men, that I could meet with none of them\r\nbut who marched upon all four.\r\n\r\nWhen these People saw that I was so little, (for most of them are\r\nTwelve Cubits long,) and that I walked only upon Two Legs, they could\r\nnot believe me to be a Man: For they were of opinion, that Nature\r\nhaving given to men as well as Beasts Two Legs and Two Arms, they\r\nshould both make use of them alike. And, indeed, reflecting upon\r\nthat since, that scituation of Body did not seem to me altogether\r\nextravagant; when I called to mind, that whilst Children are still\r\nunder the nurture of Nature, they go upon all four, and that they rise\r\nnot on their two Legs but by the care of their Nurses; who set them in\r\nlittle running Chairs, and fasten straps to them, to hinder them from\r\nfalling on all four, as the only posture that the shape of our Body\r\nnaturally inclines to rest in.\r\n\r\nThey said then, (as I had it interpreted to me since) That I was\r\ninfallibly the Female of the Queens little Animal. And therefore as\r\nsuch, or somewhat else, I was carried streight to the Town-House,\r\nwhere I observed by the muttering and gestures both of the People and\r\nMagistrates, that they were consulting what sort of a thing I could be.\r\nWhen they had conferred together a long while, a certain Burgher, who\r\nhad the keeping of the strange Beasts, besought the Mayor and Aldermen\r\nto commit me to his Custody, till the Queen should send for me to\r\ncouple me to my Male. This was granted without any difficulty, and that\r\nJuggler carried me to his House; where he taught me to Tumble, Vault,\r\nmake Mouths, and shew a Hundred odd Tricks, for which in the Afternoons\r\nhe received Money at the door from those that came in to see me.\r\n\r\nBut Heaven pitying my Sorrows, and vext to see the Temple of its Maker\r\nprofaned, so ordered it, that one day [when] I was tied to a Rope,\r\nwherewith the Mountebank made me Leap and Skip to divert the People,\r\nI heard a Man's voice, who asked me what I was, in Greek. I was much\r\nsurprised to hear one speak in that Country as they do in our World. He\r\nput some Questions to me, which I answered, and then gave him a full\r\naccount of my whole design, and the success of my Travels: He took the\r\npains to comfort me, and, as I take it, said to me: \"Well, Son, at\r\nlength you suffer for the frailties of your World: There is a Mobile[2]\r\nhere, as well as there, that can sway with nothing but what they are\r\naccustomed to: But know, that you are but justly served; for had any\r\none of this Earth had the boldness to mount up to yours, and call\r\nhimself a Man, your Sages would have destroyed him as a Monster.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Demon of Socrates]\r\n\r\nHe then told me, That he would acquaint the Court with my disaster;\r\nadding, that so soon as he had heard the news that went of me, he\r\ncame to see me, and was satisfied that I was a man of the World of\r\nwhich I said I was; because he had Travelled there formerly, and\r\nsojourned in _Greece_, where he was called the _Demon of Socrates_:\r\nThat after the Death of that Philosopher, he had governed and taught\r\n_Epaminondas_ at _Thebes_: After which being gone over to the _Romans_,\r\nJustice had obliged him to espouse the party of the Younger _Cato_:\r\nThat after his Death, he had addicted himself to Brutus: That all\r\nthese great Men having left in that World no more but the shadow of\r\ntheir Virtues, he with his Companions had retreated to Temples and\r\nSolitudes. \"In a word,\" added he, \"the People of your World became so\r\ndull and stupid, that my Companions and I lost all the Pleasure that\r\nformerly we had had in instructing them: Not but that you have heard\r\nMen talk of us; for they called us _Oracles, Nymphs, Geniuses, Fairies,\r\nHoushold-Gods, Lemmes_,[3] _Larves_[4] _Lamiers_,[5] _Hobgoblins,\r\nNayades, Incubusses, Shades, Manes, Visions_ and _Apparitions_: We\r\nabandoned your World, in the Reign of _Augustus_, not long after I had\r\nappeared to _Drusus_ the Son of _Livia_, who waged War in _Germany_,\r\nwhom I forbid to proceed any farther. It is not long since I came from\r\nthence a second time; within these Hundred Years I had a Commission to\r\nTravel thither: I roamed a great deal in _Europe_, and conversed with\r\nsome, whom possibly you may have known. One Day, amongst others, I\r\nappeared to _Cardan_,[6] as he was at his Study; I taught him a great\r\nmany things, and he in acknowledgment promised me to inform Posterity\r\nof whom he had those Wonders, which he intended to leave in writing.[7]\r\nThere I saw _Agrippa_[8] the Abbot _Trithemius_[9] Doctor _Faustus_,\r\n_La Brosse_, _Cæsar_,[10] and a certain Cabal of Young Men, who are\r\ncommonly called _Rosacrucians_[11] or _Knights of the Red Cross_, whom\r\nI taught a great many Knacks and Secrets of Nature, which without doubt\r\nhave made them pass for great Magicians: I knew _Campanella_[12] also;\r\nit was I that advised him, whilst he was in the Inquisition at _Rome_,\r\nto put his Face and Body into the usual Postures of those whose inside\r\nhe needed to know, that by the same frame of Body he might excite\r\nin himself the thoughts which the same scituation had raised in his\r\nAdversaries; because by so doing, he might better manage their Soul,\r\nwhen he came to know it; and at my desire he began a Book, which we\r\nEntituled, _De Sensu Rerum_.[13]\r\n\r\n\"I likewise haunted, in _France, La Mothe le Vayer_[14] and\r\n_Gassendus_;[15] this last hath written as much like a Philosopher,\r\nas the other lived: I have known a great many more there, whom your\r\nAge call _Divines_[16] but all that I could find in them was a great\r\ndeal of Babble and a great deal of Pride. In fine, since I past over\r\nfrom your Country into _England_, to acquaint my self with the manners\r\nof its Inhabitants, I met with a Man, the shame of his Country; for\r\ncertainly it is a great shame for the Grandees of your States to\r\nknow the virtue which in him has its Throne, and not to adore him:\r\nThat I may give you an Abridgement of his Panegyrick, he is all\r\nWit, all Heart, and possesses all the Qualities, of which one alone\r\nwas heretofore sufficient to make an Heroe: It was _Tristan_ the\r\nHermite.[17] The Truth is, I must tell you, when I perceived so exalted\r\na Virtue I mistrusted it would not be taken notice of, and therefore\r\nI endeavoured to make him accept Three Vials, the first filled with\r\nthe Oyl of Talk,[18] the other with the Powder of Projection,[19] and\r\nthe third with _Aurum Potabile_;[20] but he refused them with a more\r\ngenerous Disdain than _Diogenes_ did the Complements of _Alexander_. In\r\nfine, I can add nothing to the Elogy[21] of that Great Man, but that he\r\nis the only Poet, the only Philosopher, and the only Freeman amongst\r\nyou: These are the considerable Persons that I conversed with; all\r\nthe rest, at least that I know, are so far below Man that I have seen\r\nBeasts somewhat above them.\r\n\r\n\"After all, I am not a Native neither of this Country nor yours, I was\r\nborn in the Sun; but because sometimes our World is overstock'd with\r\npeople, by reason of the long Lives of the Inhabitants, and that there\r\nis hardly any Wars or Diseases amongst them: Our Magistrates, from time\r\nto time, send Colonies into the neighbouring Worlds. For my own part,\r\nI was commanded to go to yours; being declared Chief of the Colony\r\nthat accompanyed me. I came since into this World, for the Reasons I\r\ntold you; and that which makes me continue here, is, because the Men\r\nare great lovers of Truth; and have no Pedants among them; that the\r\nPhilosophers are never perswaded but by Reason, and that the Authority\r\nof a Doctor, or of a great number, is not preferred before the Opinion\r\nof a Thresher in a Barn, when he has right on his side. In short, none\r\nare reckoned Madmen in this Country, but Sophisters and Orators.\" I\r\nasked him how they lived? he made answer, three or four thousand Years;\r\nand thus went on:\r\n\r\n\"Though the Inhabitants of the Sun be not so numerous as those of this\r\nWorld; yet the Sun is many times over stocked, because the People being\r\nof a hot constitution are stirring and ambitious, and digest much.\"\r\n\r\n\"You ought not to be surprised at what I tell you; for though our Globe\r\nbe very vast, and yours little, though we die not before the end of\r\nFour thousand Years, and you at the end of Fifty; yet know, that as\r\nthere are not so many Stones as clods of Earth, nor so many Animals as\r\nPlants, nor so many Men as Beasts; just so there ought not to be so\r\nmany Spirits as Men, by reason of the difficulties that occur in the\r\nGeneration of a perfect Creature.\"\r\n\r\nI asked him, if they were Bodies as we are? He made answer, That they\r\nwere Bodies, but not like us, nor any thing else which we judged such;\r\nbecause we call nothing a Body commonly, but what we can touch: That,\r\nin short, there was nothing in Nature but what was material; and that\r\nthough they themselves were so, yet they were forced, when they had a\r\nmind to appear to us, to take Bodies proportionated to what our Senses\r\nare able to know; and that, without doubt, that was the reason why many\r\nhave taken the Stories that are told of them for the Delusions of a\r\nweak Fancy, because they only appeared in the night time: He told me\r\nwithal, That seeing they were necessitated to piece together the Bodies\r\nthey were to make use of, in great haste, many times they had not\r\nleisure enough to render them the Objects of more Senses than one at a\r\ntime, sometimes of the Hearing, as the Voices of _Oracles_, sometimes\r\nof the Sight, as the _Fires_ and _Visions_, sometimes of the Feeling,\r\nas the _Incubusses_; and that these Bodies being but Air condensed in\r\nsuch or such a manner, the Light dispersed them by its heat, in the\r\nsame manner as it scatters a Mist.\r\n\r\nSo many fine things as he told me, gave me the curiosity to question\r\nhim about his Birth and Death; if in the Country of the Sun, the\r\n_individual_ was procreated by the ways of Generation, and if it died\r\nby the dissolution of its Constitution, or the discomposure of its\r\nOrgans? \"Your senses,\" replied he, \"bear but too little proportion\r\nto the Explication of these Mysteries: Ye Gentlemen imagine, that\r\nwhatsoever you cannot comprehend is spiritual, or that it is not at\r\nall; but that Consequence[22] is absurd, and it is an argument, that\r\nthere are a Million of things, perhaps, in the Universe, that would\r\nrequire a Million of different Organs in you to understand them. For\r\ninstance, I by my Senses know the cause of the Sympathy that is betwixt\r\nthe Load-stone and the Pole, of the ebbing and flowing of the Sea, and\r\nwhat becomes of the Animal after Death; you cannot reach these high\r\nConceptions but by Faith, because they are Secrets above the power of\r\nyour Intellects; no more than a Blind-man can judge of the beauties of\r\na Land-skip, the Colours of a Picture, or the streaks of a Rainbow; or\r\nat best he will fancy them to be somewhat palpable, to be like Eating,\r\na Sound, or a pleasant Smell: Even so, should I attempt to explain to\r\nyou what I perceive by the Senses which you want, you would represent\r\nit to your self as somewhat that may be Heard, Seen, Felt, Smelt or\r\nTasted, and yet it is no such thing.\"\r\n\r\nHe was gone on so far in his Discourse, when my Juggler perceived, that\r\nthe Company began to be weary of my Gibberish, that they understood\r\nnot, and which they took to be an inarticulated Grunting: He therefore\r\nfell to pulling my Rope afresh to make me leap and skip, till the\r\nSpectators having had their Belly-fulls of Laughing, affirmed that I\r\nhad almost as much Wit as the Beasts of their Country, and so broke up.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Astonishment.\r\n\r\n[2] Mobile = people, populace. _Cf_. p. 145.

For you must know, that there are but two Idioms in use in that\r\nCountry, one for the Grandees, and another for the People in general.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Languages of the Moon]\r\n\r\nThat of the great ones is no more but various inarticulate Tones,\r\nmuch like to our Musick when the Words are not added to the Air:[2]\r\nand in reality it is an Invention both very useful and pleasant; for\r\nwhen they are weary of talking, or disdain to prostitute their Throats\r\nto that Office, they take either a Lute or some other Instrument,\r\nwhereby they communicate their Thoughts as well as by their Tongue:\r\nSo that sometimes Fifteen or Twenty in a Company will handle a point\r\nof Divinity, or discuss the difficulties of a Law-suit, in the most\r\nharmonious Consort that ever tickled the Ear.\r\n\r\nThe second, which is used by the Vulgar, is performed by a shivering\r\nof the Members, but not, perhaps, as you may imagine; for some parts\r\nof the Body signifie an entire Discourse; for example, the agitation\r\nof a Finger, a Hand, an Ear, a Lip, an Arm, an Eye, a Cheek, every one\r\nseverally will make up an Oration, or a Period with all the parts of\r\nit: Others serve only instead of Words, as the knitting of the Brows,\r\nthe several quiverings of the Muscles, the turning of the Hands, the\r\nstamping of the Feet, the contorsion of the Arm; so that when they\r\nspeak, as their Custom is, stark naked, their Members being used to\r\ngesticulate their Conceptions, move so quick that one would not think\r\nit to be a Man that spoke, but a Body that trembled.\r\n\r\nEvery day almost the Spirit came to see me, and his rare Conversation\r\nmade me patiently bear with the rigour of my Captivity. At length one\r\nmorning I saw a Man enter my Cabbin, whom I knew not, who having a\r\nlong while licked me gently, took me in his Teeth by the Shoulder, and\r\nwith one of his Paws, wherewith he held me up for fear I might hurt my\r\nself, threw me upon his Back; where I found my self so softly seated,\r\nand so much at my ease, that, [though] being afflicted to be used like\r\na Beast, I had not the least desire of making my escape; and besides,\r\nthese Men that go upon all four are much swifter than we, seeing the\r\nheaviest of them make nothing of running down a Stagg.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time I was extreamly troubled that I had no news of my\r\ncourteous Spirit; and the first night we came to our Inn, as I was\r\nwalking in the Court, expecting till Supper should be ready, a pretty\r\nhandsome young Man came smiling in my Face and cast his Two Fore-Legs\r\nabout my Neck. After I had a little considered him: \"How!\" said he in\r\n_French_, \"do you [not] know your Friend then?\" I leave you to judge in\r\nwhat case I was at that time; really, my surprise was so great, that I\r\nbegan to imagine, that all the Globe of the Moon, all that had befallen\r\nme, and all that I had seen, had only been Enchantment: And that\r\nBeast-man, who was the same that had carried me all day, continued to\r\nspeak to me in this manner; \"You promised me, that the good Offices I\r\ndid you should never be forgotten, and yet it seems you have never seen\r\nme before;\" but perceiving me still in amaze: \"In fine,\" said he, \"I am\r\nthat same Demon of Socrates, who diverted you during your Imprisonment,\r\nand who, that I may still oblige you, took to my self a Body, on which\r\nI carried you to day:\" \"But,\" said I interrupting him, \"how can that\r\nbe, seeing that all Day you were of a very long Stature, and now you\r\nare very short; that all day long you had a weak and broken Voice, and\r\nnow you have a clear and vigorous one; that, in short, all day long you\r\nwere a Grey-headed old Man, and are now a brisk young Blade: Is it then\r\nthat whereas in my Country, the Progress is from Life to Death; Animals\r\nhere go Retrograde from Death to Life, and by growing old become young\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\n\"So soon as I had spoken to the Prince,\" said he, \"and received orders\r\nto bring you to Court, I went and found you out where you were, and\r\nhave brought you hither; but the Body I acted in was so tired out with\r\nthe Journey, that all its Organs refused me their ordinary Functions,\r\nso that I enquired the way to the Hospital; where being come in I found\r\nthe Body of a young Man, just then expired by a very odd Accident, but\r\nyet very common in this Country. I drew near him, pretending to find\r\nmotion in him still, and protesting to those who were present, that he\r\nwas not dead, and that what they thought to be the cause of his Death,\r\nwas no more but a bare Lethargy; so that without being perceived, I put\r\nmy Mouth to his, by which I entered as with a breath: Then down dropt\r\nmy old Carcass, and as if I had been that young Man, I rose and came to\r\nlook for you, leaving the Spectators crying a Miracle.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Manner of Eating]\r\n\r\nWith this they came to call us to Supper, and I followed my Guide\r\ninto a Parlour richly furnished; but where I found nothing fit to be\r\neaten. No Victuals appearing, when I was ready to die of Hunger, made\r\nme ask him where the Cloath was laid: But I could not hear what he\r\nanswered, for at that instant Three or Four young Boys, Children of\r\nthe House, drew near, and with much Civility stript me to the Shirt.\r\nThis new Ceremony so astonished me, that I durst not so much as ask\r\nmy Pretty _Valets de Chamber_ the cause of it; and I cannot tell how\r\nmy Guide, who asked me what I would begin with, could draw from me\r\nthese two Words, _A Potage_; but hardly had I pronounced them, when I\r\nsmelt the odour of the most agreeable Soop that ever steamed in the\r\nrich Gluttons Nose: I was about to rise from my place, that I might\r\ntrace that delicious Scent to its source, but my Carrier hindered me:\r\n\"Whither are you going,\" said he, \"we shall fetch a walk by and by;\r\nbut now it is time to Eat, make an end of your _Potage_, and then\r\nwe'll have something else:\" \"And where the Devil is the _Potage_?\"\r\nanswered I half angry: \"Have you laid a wager you'll jeer me all this\r\nDay?\" \"I thought,\" replied he, \"that at the Town we came from, you had\r\nseen your Master or some Bo[dy] else at meal, and that's the reason\r\nI told you not, how People feed in this Country. Seeing then you are\r\nstill ignorant, you must know, that here they live on Steams. The\r\nart of Cookery is to shut up in great Vessels, made on purpose, the\r\nExhalations that proceed from the Meat whilst it is a dressing; and\r\nwhen they have provided enough of several sorts and several tastes,\r\naccording to the Appetite of those they treat; they open one Vessel\r\nwhere that Steam is kept, and after that another; and so on till the\r\nCompany be satisfied.\r\n\r\n\"Unless you have already lived after this manner, you would never\r\nthink, that the Nose without Teeth and Gullet can perform the office of\r\nthe Mouth in feeding a Man; but I'll make you experience it your self.\"\r\nHe had no sooner said so, but I found so many agreeable and nourishing\r\nVapours enter the Parlour, one after another, that in less than half a\r\nquarter of an Hour I was fully satisfied. When we were got up; \"This\r\nis not a matter,\" said he, \"much to be admired at, seeing you cannot\r\nhave lived so long, and not have observed, that all sorts of Cooks, who\r\neat less than People of another Calling, are nevertheless much Fatter.\r\nWhence proceeds that Plumpness, d'ye think, unless it be from the\r\nSteams that continually environ them, which penetrate into their Bodies\r\nand fatten them? Hence it is, that the People of this World enjoy a\r\nmore steady and vigorous Health, by reason that their Food hardly\r\nengenders any Excrements, which are in a manner the original[3] of all\r\nDiseases. You were, perhaps, surprised, that before supper you were\r\nstript, since it is a Custom not practised in your Country; but it is\r\nthe fashion of this, and for this end used, that the Animal may be the\r\nmore transpirable to the Fumes.\" \"Sir,\" answered I, \"there is a great\r\ndeal of probability in what you say, and I have found somewhat of it my\r\nself by experience; but I must frankly tell you, That not being able\r\nto Unbrute my self so soon, I should be glad to feel something that\r\nmy Teeth might fix upon:\" He promised I should, but not before next\r\nDay; \"because,\" said he, \"to Eat so soon after your meal would breed\r\nCrudities.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Manner of Lighting]\r\n\r\nAfter we had discoursed a little longer, we went up to a Chamber to\r\ntake our rest; a Man met us on the top of the Stairs, who having\r\nattentively Eyed us, led me into a Closet where the floor was strowed\r\nwith Orang-Flowers Three Foot thick, and my Spirit into another filled\r\nwith Gilly-Flowers and Jessamines: Perceiving me amazed at that\r\nMagnificence, he told me they were the Beds of the Country. In fine,\r\nwe laid our selves down to rest in our several Cells, and so soon as\r\nI had stretched my self out upon my Flowers, by the light of Thirty\r\nlarge Glow-worms shut up in a Crystal, (being the only Candles _Charon_\r\nuses,[4]) I perceived the Three or Four Boys who had stript me before\r\nSupper, One tickling my Feet, another my Thighs, the Third my Flanks,\r\nand the Fourth my Arms, and all so delicately and daintily, that in\r\nless than in a Minute I was fast asleep.\r\n\r\nNext Morning by Sun-rising my Spirit came into my Room and said to me,\r\n\"Now I'll be as good as my Word, you shall breakfast this Morning more\r\nsolidly that you Supped last Night.\" With that I got up, and he led\r\nme by the Hand to a place at the back of the Garden, where one of the\r\nChildren of the House stayed for us, with a Piece in his Hand much like\r\nto one of our Fire-Locks. He asked my Guide if I would have a dozen\r\nof Larks, because _Baboons_ (one of which he took me to be,) loved to\r\nfeed on them? I had hardly answered, Yes, when the Fowler discharged a\r\nShot, and Twenty or Thirty Larks fell at our Feet ready Roasted. This,\r\nthought I presently with my self, verifies the Proverb in our World,\r\nof a Country where Larks fall ready Roasted; without doubt it has been\r\nmade by some Body that came from hence. \"Fall too, fall too,\" said\r\nmy Spirit, \"don't spare; for they have a knack of mingling a certain\r\nComposition with their Powder and Shot, which Kills, Plucks, Roasts,\r\nand Seasons the Fowl all at once.\" I took up some of them, and eat them\r\nupon his word; and to say the Truth, In all my Life time I never eat\r\nany thing so delicious.\r\n\r\nHaving thus Breakfasted we prepared to be gone, and with a Thousand odd\r\nFaces, which they use when they would shew their Love, our Landlord\r\nreceived a Paper from my Spirit. I asked him, if it was a Note for the\r\nReckoning? He replied, No, that all was paid, and that it was a Copy of\r\nVerses. \"How! Verses,\" said I, \"are your Inn-Keepers here curious of\r\nRhime then?\" \"It's,\" said he, \"the Money of the Country, and the charge\r\nwe have been at here, hath been computed to amount to Three _Couplets_,\r\nor Six Verses, which I have given him. I did not fear we should outrun\r\nthe Constable; for though we should Pamper our selves for a whole Week,\r\nwe could not spend a _Sonnet_, and I have Four about me, besides Two\r\n_Epigrams_, Two _Odes_, and an _Eclogue_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would to God,\" said I, \"it were so in our World; for I know a good\r\nmany honest Poets there who are ready to Starve, and who might live\r\nplentifully if that Money would pass in Payment.\" I farther asked\r\nhim, If these Verses would always serve, if one Transcribed them? He\r\nmade answer, No, and so went on: \"When an Author has Composed any, he\r\ncarries them to the Mint, where the sworn Poets of the Kingdom sit in\r\nCourt. There these versifying Officers essay the pieces; and if they be\r\njudged Sterling, they are rated not according to their Coyn; that's to\r\nsay, That a _Sonnet_ is not always as good as a _Sonnet_; but according\r\nto the intrinsick value of the piece; so that if any one Starve, he\r\nmust be a Blockhead: For Men of Wit make always good Chear.\" With\r\nExtasie I was admiring the judicious Policy of that Country, when he\r\nproceeded in this manner:\r\n\r\n\"There are others who keep Publick-house after a far different manner:\r\nWhen one is about to be gone, they demand, proportionably to the\r\nCharges, an Acquittance for the other World; and when that is given\r\nthem, they write down in a great Register, which they call _Doomsday's\r\nBook_, much after this manner: _Item_, The value of so many Verses,\r\ndelivered such a Day, to such a Person, which he is to pay upon the\r\nreceipt of this Acquittance, out of his readiest Cash: And when they\r\nfind themselves in danger of Death, they cause these Registers to be\r\nChopt in pieces, and swallow them down; because they believe, that if\r\nthey were not thus digested, they would be good for nothing.\"\r\n\r\nThis Conversation was no hinderance to our Journey; for my Four-legged\r\nPorter jogged on under me, and I rid stradling on his Back. I shall not\r\nbe particular in relating to you all the Adventures that happened to us\r\non our way, till we arrived at length at the Town where the King holds\r\nhis Residence.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Officious = kindly, ready to serve, doing good offices. _Cf_.\r\nMilton, _Paradise Lost_:\r\n\r\n    \"Yet, not to earth are those bright luminaries\r\n    Officious; but to thee, earth's habitant.\"\r\n\r\n[2] Cf. _The Man in the Moone_, of Francis Godwin: \"Their Language\r\nis very difficult, since it hath no Affinity with any other I ever\r\nheard, and consists not so much of Words and Letters, as Tunes and\r\nstrange Sounds which no Letters can express; for there are few Words\r\nbut signify several Things, and are distinguished only by their Sounds,\r\nwhich are sung as it were in uttering; yea many Words consist of Tunes\r\nonly, without Words.\"\r\n\r\n[3] Origin. _Cf_. pp. 137, 170, 174*; and _cf_.

My Guide was my\r\nInterpreter; and yet he himself understood not the Riddle, and knew\r\nnot what to make of that little Animal of the Queen's; but we were\r\nsoon satisfied as to that; for the King having some time considered\r\nme, ordered it to be brought, and about half an hour after I saw a\r\ncompany of Apes, wearing Ruffs and Breeches, come in, and amongst them\r\na little Man almost of my own Built, for he went on Two Legs; so soon\r\nas he perceived me, he Accosted me with a _Criado de vuestra merced_[1]\r\nI answered his Greeting much in the same Terms. But alas! no sooner\r\nhad they seen us talk together, but they believed their Conjecture to\r\nbe true; and so, indeed, it seemed; for he of all the By-standers,\r\nthat past the most favourable Judgment upon us, protested that our\r\nConversation was a Chattering we kept for Joy at our meeting again.\r\n\r\nThat little Man told me, that he was an _European_, a Native of old\r\n_Castille_:[2] That he had found a means by the help of Birds[3] to\r\nmount up to the World of the Moon, where then we were: That falling\r\ninto the Queen's Hands, she had taken him for a Monkey, because Fate\r\nwould have it so, That in that Country they cloath Apes in a _Spanish_\r\nDress; and that upon his arrival, being found in that habit, she had\r\nmade no doubt but he was of the same kind. \"It could not otherwise be,\"\r\nreplied I, \"but having tried all Fashions of Apparel upon them, none\r\nwere found so Ridiculous, and by consequence more becoming a kind of\r\nAnimals which are only entertained for Pleasure and Diversion.\" \"That\r\nshews you little understand the Dignity of our Nation,\" answered he,\r\n\"for whom the Universe breeds Men only to be our Slaves, and Nature\r\nproduces nothing but objects of Mirth and Laughter.\" He then intreated\r\nme to tell him, how I durst be so bold as to Scale the Moon with the\r\nMachine I told him of? I answered, That it was because he had carried\r\naway the Birds, which I intended to have made use of. He smiled at this\r\nRaillery; and about a quarter of an hour after, the King commanded\r\nthe Keeper of the Monkeys to carry us back. The King's Pleasure was\r\npunctually obeyed; at which I was very glad, for the satisfaction\r\nI had, of having a Mate to converse with during the solitude of my\r\nBrutification.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The \"Little Spaniard's\" Trip to the Moon--From an\r\nEngraving in \"The Strange Voyage of Domingo Gonzales to the World in\r\nthe Moon.\"]\r\n\r\nOne Day my Male (for I was taken for the Female) told me, That the\r\ntrue reason which had obliged him to travel all over the Earth, and at\r\nlength to abandon it for the Moon, was that he could not find so much\r\nas one Country where even Imagination was at liberty. \"Look ye,\" said\r\nhe, \"how the Wittiest thing you can say, unless you wear a Cornered\r\nCap, if it thwart the Principles of the Doctors of the Robe, you are an\r\nIdeot, a Fool, and something worse perhaps. I was about to have been\r\nput into the Inquisition at home, for maintaining to the Pedants Teeth,\r\nThat there was a _Vacuum_, and that I knew no one matter in the World\r\nmore Ponderous than another.\" I asked him, what probable Arguments\r\nhe had, to confirm so new an Opinion? \"To evince that,\" answered he,\r\n\"you must suppose that there is but one Element; for though we see\r\nWater, Earth, Air and Fire distinct, yet are they never found to be\r\nso perfectly pure but that there still remains some Mixture. For\r\nexample, When you behold Fire, it is not Fire but Air much extended;\r\nthe Air is but Water much dilated; Water is but liquified Earth, and\r\nthe Earth it self but condensed Water; and thus if you weigh Matter\r\nseriously, you'll find it is but one, which like an excellent Comedian\r\nhere below acts all Parts, in all sorts of Dresses: Otherwise we must\r\nadmit as many Elements as there are kinds of Bodies: And if you ask\r\nme why Fire burns, and Water cools, since it is but one and the same\r\nmatter, I answer, That that matter acts by Sympathy, according to the\r\nDisposition it is in at the time when it acts. Fire, which is nothing\r\nbut Earth also, more dilated than is fit for the constitution of Air,\r\nstrives to change into it self, by Sympathy, what ever it meets with:\r\nThus the heat of Coals, being the most subtile Fire, and most proper to\r\npenetrate a Body, at first slides through the pores of our Skin; and\r\nbecause it is a new matter that fills us, it makes us exhale in Sweat;\r\nthat Sweat dilated by the Fire is converted to a Steam, and becomes\r\nAir; that Air being farther ratified by the heat of the _Antiperistasis_,\r\nor of the Neighbouring Stars, is called Fire, and the Earth abandoned\r\nby the Cold and Humidity which were Ligaments to the whole, falls to\r\nthe ground: Water, on the other hand, though it no ways differ from the\r\nmatter of Fire, but in that it is closer, burns us not; because that\r\nbeing dense by Sympathy, it closes up the Bodies it meets with, and\r\nthe Cold we feel is no more but the effect of our Flesh contracting it\r\nself, because of the Vicinity of Earth or Water, which constrains it to\r\na Resemblance. Hence it is, that those who are troubled with a Dropsie\r\nconvert all their nourishment into Water; and the Cholerick convert all\r\nthe Blood that is formed in their Liver into Choler.\r\n\r\n\"It being then supposed, that there is but one Element; it is most\r\ncertain, that all Bodies, according to their several qualities, incline\r\nequally towards the Center of the Earth. But you'll ask me, Why then\r\ndoes Iron, Metal, Earth and Wood, descend more swiftly to the Center\r\nthan a Sponge, if it be not that it is full of Air which naturally\r\ntends upwards? That is not at all the Reason, and thus I make it out:\r\nThough a Rock fall with greater Rapidity than a Feather, both of\r\nthem have the same inclination for the Journey; but a Cannon Bullet,\r\nfor instance, were the Earth pierced through, would precipitate with\r\ngreater haste to the Center thereof than a Bladder full of Wind; and\r\nthe reason is, because that mass of Metal is a great deal of Earth\r\ncontracted into a little space, and that Wind a very little Earth in\r\na large space: For all the parts of Matter, being so closely joined\r\ntogether in the Iron, encrease their force by their Union; because\r\nbeing thus compacted, they are many that Fight against a few, seeing a\r\nparcel of Air equal to the Bullet in Bigness is not equal in Quantity.\r\n\r\n\"Not to insist on a long Deduction of Arguments to prove this, tell\r\nme in good earnest, How a Pike, a Sword or a Dagger wounds us? If it\r\nbe not because the Steel, being a matter wherein the parts are more\r\ncontinuous and more closely knit together than your Flesh is, whose\r\nPores and Softness shew that it contains but very little Matter within\r\na great extent of Place; and that the point of the Steel that pricks\r\nus, being almost an innumerable number of Particles of matter against\r\na very little Flesh, it forces it to yield to the stronger, in the\r\nsame manner as a Squadron in close order will easily break through a\r\nmore open Battalion; for why does a Bit of red hot Iron burn more than\r\na Log of Wood all on Fire? Unless it be, that in the Iron there is\r\nmore Fire in a small space, seeing it adheres to all the parts of the\r\nMetal, than in the Wood which being very Spongy by consequence contains\r\na great deal of _Vacuity_; and that _Vacuity_, being but a Privation\r\nof Being, cannot receive the form of Fire. But, you'll object, you\r\nsuppose a _Vacuum_, as if you had proved it, and that's begging of the\r\nquestion: Well then I'll prove it, and though that difficulty be the\r\nSister of the _Gordian knot_, yet my Arms are strong enough to become\r\nits _Alexander_.\r\n\r\n\"Let that vulgar Beast, then, who does not think it self a Man, had it\r\nnot been told so, answer me if it can: Suppose now there be but one\r\nMatter, as I think I have sufficiently proved; whence comes it, that\r\naccording to its Appetite it enlarges or contracts its self; whence is\r\nit, that a piece of Earth by being Condensed becomes a Stone? Is it\r\nthat the parts of that Stone are placed one with another, in such a\r\nmanner that wherever that grain of Sand is settled, even there, or in\r\nthe same point, another grain of Sand is Lodged? That cannot be, no not\r\naccording to their own Principles, seeing there is no Penetration of\r\nBodies: But that matter must have crowded together, and if you will,\r\nabridged it self, so that it hath filled some place which was empty\r\nbefore. To say that it is incomprehensible, that there should be a\r\nNothing in the World, that we are in part made up of Nothing: Why not,\r\npray? Is not the whole World wrapt up in Nothing? Since you yield me\r\nthis point, then confess ingeniously, that it's as rational that the\r\nWorld should have a Nothing within it, as Nothing about it.\r\n\r\n\"I well perceive you'll put the question to me, Why Water compressed\r\nin a Vessel by the Frost should break it, if it be not to hinder\r\na Vacuity? But I answer, That that only happens, because the Air\r\noverhead, which as well as Earth and Water tends to the Center, meeting\r\nwith an empty Tun by the way, takes tip his Lodging there: If it find\r\nthe pores of that Vessel, that's to say, the ways that lead to that\r\nvoid place, too narrow, too long, and too crooked, with impatience it\r\nbreaks through and arrives at its Tun.\r\n\r\n\"But not to trifle away time, in answering all their objections, I\r\ndare be bold to say, That if there were no _Vacuity_, there could be\r\nno Motion; or else a Penetration of Bodies must be admitted; for it\r\nwould be a little too ridiculous to think, that when a Gnat pushes\r\nback a parcel of Air with its Wings, that parcel drives another before\r\nit, that other another still; and that so the stirring of the little\r\nToe of a Flea should raise a bunch upon the Back of the Universe. When\r\nthey are at a stand, they have recourse to Rarefaction: But in good\r\nearnest, How can it be when a Body is ratified, that one Particle of\r\nthe Mass does recede from another Particle, without leaving an empty\r\nSpace betwixt them; must not the two Bodies, which are just separated,\r\nhave been at the same time in the same place of this; and that so they\r\nmust have all three penetrated each other? I expect you'll ask me, why\r\nthrough a Reed, a Syringe or a Pump, Water is forced to ascend contrary\r\nto its inclination? To which I answer, That that's by violence, and\r\nthat it is not the fear of a _Vacuity_ that turns it out of the right\r\nway; but that being linked to the Air by an imperceptible Chain, it\r\nrises when the Air, to which it is joined, is rarified.\r\n\r\n\"That's no such knotty Difficulty, when one knows the perfect Circle\r\nand the delicate Concatenation of the Elements: For if you attentively\r\nconsider the Slime which joines the Earth and Water together in\r\nMarriage, you'll find that it is neither Earth nor Water; but the\r\nMediator betwixt these Two Enemies. In the same manner, the Water and\r\nAir reciprocally send a Mist, that dives into the Humours of both, to\r\nnegotiate a Peace betwixt them; and the Air is reconciled to the Fire,\r\nby means of an interposing Exhalation which Unites them.\"\r\n\r\nI believe he would have proceeded in his Discourse, had they not\r\nbrought us our Victuals; and seeing we were a hungry, I stopt my Ears\r\nto his discourse, and opened my Stomack to the Food they gave us.\r\n\r\nI remember another time, when we were upon our Philosophy, for neither\r\nof us took pleasure to Discourse of mean things: \"I am vexed,\" said he,\r\n\"to see a Wit of your stamp infected with the Errors of the Vulgar. You\r\nmust know then, in spight of the Pedantry of _Aristotle_ with which\r\nyour Schools in _France_ still ring, That every thing is in every\r\nthing; that's to say, for instance, That in the Water there is Fire,\r\nin the Fire Water, in the Air Earth, and in the Earth Air: Though that\r\nOpinion makes Scholars open their Eyes as big as Sawcers, yet it is\r\neasier to prove it, than perswade it. For I ask them, in the first\r\nplace, if Water does not breed Filth: If they deny it, let them dig a\r\nPit, fill it with meer Element,[4] and to prevent all blind Objections\r\nlet them if they please strain it through a Strainer, and I'll oblige\r\nmy self, in case they find no Filth therein within a certain time,\r\nto drink up all the Water they have poured into it: But if they find\r\nFilth, as I make no doubt on't; it is a convincing Argument that there\r\nis both Salt and Fire there. Consequentially now, to find Water in\r\nFire; I take it to be no difficult Task. For let them chuse Fire, even\r\nthat which is most abstracted from Matter, as Comets are, there is\r\na great deal in them still; seeing if that Unctuous Humour, whereof\r\nthey are engendered, being reduced to a Sulphur by the heat of the\r\nAntiperistasis which kindles them, did not find a curb of its Violence\r\nin the humid Cold that qualifies and resists it, it would spend it self\r\nin a trice like Lightning. Now that there is Air in the Earth, they\r\nwill not deny it; or otherwise they have never heard of the terrible\r\nEarth-quakes, that have so often shaken the Mountains of _Sicily_:\r\nBesides, the Earth is full of Pores, even to the least grains of Sand\r\nthat com[pose] it. Nevertheless no Man hath as yet said, that these\r\nHollows were filled with _Vacuity_: It will not be taken amiss then, I\r\nhope, if the Air takes up its quarters there. It remains to be proved,\r\nthat there is Earth in the Air; but I think it scarcely worth my pains,\r\nseeing you are convinced of it, as often as you see such numberless\r\nLegions of Atomes fall upon your heads, as even stiffle Arithmetick.\r\n\r\n\"But let us pass from simple to compound Bodies, they'll furnish me\r\nwith much more frequent Subjects; and to demonstrate that all things\r\nare in all things, not that they change into one another, as your\r\n_Peripateticks_ Juggle:[5] for I will maintain to their Teeth, that the\r\nPrinciples mingle, separate, and mingle again in such a manner, that\r\nthat hath been made Water by the Wise Creator of the World, will always\r\nbe Water; I shall suppose no Maxime, as they do, but what I prove.\r\n\r\n\"And therefore take a Billet, or any other combustible stuff, and set\r\nFire to it, they'll say when it is in a Flame, That what was Wood is\r\nnow become Fire; but I maintain the contrary, and that there is no more\r\nFire in it, when it is all in Flame, than before it was kindled; but\r\nthat which before was hid in the Billet, and by the Humidity and Cold\r\nhindered from acting; being now assisted by the Stranger, hath rallied\r\nits forces against the Phlegm that choaked it, and commanding the Field\r\nof Battle, that was possessed by its Enemy, triumphs over his Jaylor\r\nand appears without Fetters. Don't you see how the Water flees out at\r\nthe two ends of the Billet, hot and smoaking from the Fight it was\r\nengaged in. That flame which you see rise on high is the purer Fire,\r\nunpestered from the Matter, and by consequence the readiest to return\r\nhome to it self: Nevertheless it Unites it self by tapering into a\r\nPiramide till it rise to a certain height, that it may pierce through\r\nthe thick Humidity of the Air which resists it; but as mounting it\r\ndisengaged it self by little and little from the violent company of its\r\nLandlords; so it diffuses it self, because then it meets with nothing\r\nthat thwarts its passage, which negligence, though, is many times the\r\ncause of a second Captivity: For marching stragglingly, it wanders\r\nsometimes into a Cloud, and if it meet there with a Party of its own\r\nsufficient to make head against a Vapour, they Engage, Grumble, Thunder\r\nand Roar, and the Death of Innocents is many times the effect of the\r\nanimated Rage of those inanimated Things. If, when it finds it self\r\npestered among those Crudities of the middle Region, it is not strong\r\nenough to make a defence, it yields to its Enemy upon discretion;\r\nwhich by its weight constrains it to fall again to the Earth: And this\r\nWretch,[6] inclosed in a drop of Rain, may per haps fall at the Foot\r\nof an Oak, whose Animal Fire will invite the poor Straggler to take a\r\nLodging with him; and thus you have it in the same condition again as\r\nit was a few Days before.\r\n\r\n\"But let us trace the Fortune of the other Elements that composed that\r\nBillet. The Air retreats to its own Quarters also, though blended\r\nwith Vapours; because the Fire all in a rage drove them briskly\r\nout _Pell-mell_ together. Now you have it serving the Winds for a\r\nTennis-ball, furnishing Breath to Animals, filling up the Vacuities\r\nthat Nature hath left; and, it may be also, wrapt up in a drop of Dew,\r\nsuckling the thirsty Leaves of that Tree, whither our Fire retreated:\r\nThe Water driven from its Throne by the Flame, being by the heat\r\nelevated to the Nursery of the Meteors, will distil again in Rain upon\r\nour Oak, as soon as upon another; and the Earth being turned to Ashes,\r\nand then cured of its Sterility, either by the nourishing Heat of a\r\nDunghill on which it hath been thrown, or by the vegetative Salt of\r\nsome neighbouring Plants, or by the teeming Waters of some Rivers, may\r\nhappen also to be near this Oak, which by the heat of its Germ will\r\nattract it, and convert it into a part of its bulk.\r\n\r\n\"In this manner, these Four Elements undergo the same Destiny, and\r\nreturn to the same State, which they quitted but a few days before: So\r\nthat it may be said, that all that's necessary for the composition of\r\na Tree, is in a Man; and in a Tree, all that's necessary for making of\r\na Man. In fine, according to this way, all things will be found in all\r\nthings; but we want a _Prometheus_, to pluck us out of the Bosom of\r\nNature, and render us sensible, which I am willing to call the _First\r\nMatter_\"[7]\r\n\r\nThese were the things, I think, with which we past the time; for that\r\nlittle _Spaniard_ had a quaint Wit. Our conversation, however, was only\r\nin the Night time; because from Six a clock in the morning until night,\r\nCrowds of the People, that came to stare at us in our Lodging, would\r\nhave disturbed us: For some threw us Stones, others Nuts, and others\r\nGrass; there was no talk, but of the Kings Beasts; we had our Victuals\r\ndaily at set hours. I cannot tell, whether it was that I minded their\r\nGestures and Tones more than my Male did: But I learnt sooner than he\r\nto understand their Language, and to smatter a little of it, which made\r\nus to be lookt upon in another guess manner than formerly; and the news\r\nthereupon flew presently all over the Kingdom, that two Wild Men had\r\nbeen found, who were less than other Men, by reason of the bad Food we\r\nhad had in the Desarts; and who through a defect of their Parents Seed,\r\nhad not the fore Legs strong enough to support their Bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] \"Your excellency's servant.\"\r\n\r\n[2] Domingo Gonzales, the hero of Bishop Francis Godwin's _The Man in\r\nthe Moone_ (see Translator to Reader, note 2), who says of himself: \"I\r\nmust acknowledge my Stature is so little, as I think no Man living is\r\nless.\"\r\n\r\n[3] The engraving opposite, showing how he was carried up by his birds,\r\nis copied from an old edition of _The Man in the Moone_. The other\r\nwinged figures about him are supposed to represent demons who attacked\r\nhim when just above \"the middle region.\"\r\n\r\n[4] With the _pure_ element (Lat., _merus_); _i.e._, water alone\r\nunmixed with impurities or other elements.\r\n\r\n[5] Fr. gazouillent, _babble_.\r\n\r\n[6] Unfortunate creature (\"ce malheureux\").\r\n\r\n[7] The translator has here mistaken a Dative for an Accusative. The\r\nsense of the French is: \"But we need a Prometheus to pluck out for us,\r\nfrom the bosom of Nature, and make tangible to us, that which I will\r\ncall _First Matter_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Where the Author comes in doubt, whether he be a_ Man, _an_ Ape, _or an_\r\nEstridge;[1] _and of the Opinion of the Lunar Philosophers concerning_\r\nAristotle.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis belief would have taken rooting by being spread, had it not been\r\nfor the Learned Men of the Country, who opposed it, saying, That it\r\nwas horrid Impiety to believe not only Beasts, but Monsters, to be of\r\ntheir kind. It would be far more probable, (added the calmer Sort) that\r\nour Domestick Beasts should participate of the privilege of Humanity\r\nand by consequence of Immortality, as being bred in our Country, than\r\na Monstrous Beast that talks of being born I know not where, in the\r\nMoon; and then observe the difference betwixt us and them. We walk upon\r\nFour Feet, because God would not trust so precious a thing upon weaker\r\nSupporters, and he was afraid least marching otherwise some Mischance\r\nmight befall Man; and therefore he took the pains to rest him upon four\r\nPillars, that he might not fall, but disdaining to have a hand in the\r\nFabrick of these two Brutes, he left them to the Caprice of Nature, who\r\nnot concerning her self with the loss of so small a matter, supported\r\nthem only by Two Feet.\r\n\r\n\"Birds themselves,\" said they, \"have not had so hard measure as they;\r\nfor they have got Feathers at least, to supply the weakness of their,\r\nLegs, and to cast themselves in the Air when we pursue them; whereas\r\nNature, depriving these Monsters of Two Legs, hath disabled them from\r\nscaping our Justice.\r\n\r\n\"Besides, consider a little how they have the Head raised toward\r\nHeaven; it is because God would punish them with scarcity of all\r\nthings, that he hath so placed them; for that supplicant Posture shews\r\nthat they complain to Heaven of him that Created them, and that they\r\nbeg Permission to make their best of our Leavings. But we, on the\r\ncontrary, have the Head bending downwards, to behold the Blessings\r\nwhereof we are the Masters, and as if there were nothing in Heaven that\r\nour happy condition needed Envy.\"\r\n\r\nI heard such Discourses, or the like, daily at my Lodge; and at length\r\nthey so curbed the minds of the people as to that point, that it was\r\ndecreed, That at best I should only pass for a Parrot without Feathers;\r\nfor they confirmed those who were already perswaded, in that I had but\r\ntwo Legs no more than a Bird, which was the cause that I was put into a\r\nCage by express orders from the Privy Council.\r\n\r\nThere the Queen's Bird-keeper taking the pains daily to teach me\r\nto Whistle, as they do Stares[2] or Singing-Birds here, I was\r\nreally happy in that I wanted not Food; In the mean while, with the\r\nSonnets[3] the Spectators stunned me [with], I learnt to speak as they\r\ndid; so that when I was got to be so much Master of the Idiom as to\r\nexpress most of my thoughts, I told them the finest of my Conceits.\r\nThe Quaintness of my Sayings was already the entertainment of all\r\nSocieties, and my Wit was so much esteemed that the Council was obliged\r\nto Publish an Edict, forbidding all People to believe that I was\r\nendowed with Reason; with express Commands to all Persons, of what\r\nQuality or Condition soever, not to imagine but that whatever I did,\r\nthough never so wittily, proceeded only from Instinct.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the decision of what I was, divided the Town into Two\r\nFactions. The party that stood for me encreased daily; and at length\r\nin spight of the _Anathema_, whereby they endeavoured to scare the\r\nmultitude: They who held for me, demanded a Convention of the States,\r\nfor determining that Controversie. It was long before they could agree\r\nin the Choice of those who should have a Vote; but the Arbitrators\r\npacified the heat, by making the number of both parties equal, who\r\nordered that I should be brought unto the Assembly, as I was: But I was\r\ntreated there with all imaginable Severity. My Examiners, amongst other\r\nthings, put questions of Philosophy to me; I ingenuously told them all\r\nthat my Tutor had heretofore taught me, but they easily refuted me by\r\nmore convincing Arguments: So that having nothing to answer for my\r\nself, my last refuge was to Principles of _Aristotle_, which stood me\r\nin as little stead, as his Sophisms did; for in two Words, they let me\r\nsee the falsity of them.\r\n\r\n\"That same Aristotle,\" said they, \"whose Learning you brag so much of,\r\ndid without doubt accommodate Principles to his Philosophy;[4] instead\r\nof accommodating his Philosophy to Principles; and besides he ought to\r\nhave proved them at least to be more rational than those of the other\r\nSects you mentioned to us: Wherefore the good Man will not take it ill,\r\nwe hope, if we bid him God b'w'.\"\r\n\r\nIn fine, when they perceived that I did nothing but bawl, that they\r\nwere not more knowing than Aristotle, and that I was forbid to\r\ndispute against those who denied his Principles: They all unanimously\r\nconcluded, That I was not a Man, but perhaps a kind of _Estridge_,[5]\r\nseeing I carried my Head upright like them, that I walked on two\r\nLegs, and that, in short, but for a little Down, I was every way like\r\none of them; so that the Bird-keeper was ordered to have me back to\r\nmy Cage. I spent my time pretty pleasantly there, for because I had\r\ncorrectly learned their Language, the whole Court took pleasure to\r\nmake me prattle. The Queen's Maids, among the rest, slipt always some\r\nBoon into my Basket, and the gentilest of them all, having conceived\r\nsome kindness for me, was so transported with Joy, when in private I\r\nentertained her with the manners and divertisements of the People of\r\nour World, and especially our Bells, and other Instruments of Musick,\r\nthat she protested to me, with Tears in her Eyes, That if ever I found\r\nmy self in a condition to fly back again to our World, she would follow\r\nme with all her Heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Ostrich.\r\n\r\n[2] Starlings.\r\n\r\n[3] Fr., \"sornettes,\" _nonsense_.\r\n\r\n[4] Wrest the facts to fit his theories.\r\n\r\n[5] Ostrich.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the Manner of making War in the Moon; and of how the Moon is not the\r\nMoon, nor the Earth the Earth._\r\n\r\n\r\nOne Morning early, having started out of my Sleep, I found her\r\nTaboring[1] upon the grates of my Cage: \"Take good heart,\" said she to\r\nme, \"yesterday in Council a War was resolved upon, against the King\r\n[Illustration: bar 1][2] I hope that during the hurry of Preparations,\r\nwhilst our Monarch and his Subjects are absent, I may find an occasion\r\nto make your escape.\" \"How, a War,\" said I interrupting her, \"have the\r\nPrinces of this World, then, any quarrels amongst themselves, as those\r\nof ours have? Good now, let me know their way of Fighting.\"\r\n\r\n\"When the Arbitrators,\" replied she, \"who are freely chosen by the two\r\nParties, have appointed the time for raising Forces for their March,\r\nthe number of Combatants, the day and place of Battle, and all with\r\nso great equality, that there is not one Man more in one Army, than\r\nin the other: All the maimed Soldiers on the one side, are lifted in\r\none Company; and when they come to engage, the _Mareshalls de Camp_[3]\r\ntake care to expose them to the maimed of the other side: The Giants\r\nare matched with Colosses, the Fencers with those that can handle their\r\nWeapons, the Valiant with the Stout, the Weak with the Infirm, the Sick\r\nwith the Indisposed, the Sturdy with the Strong; and if any undertake\r\nto strike at another than the Enemy he is matched with, unless he can\r\nmake it out that it was by mistake, he is Condemned for a Coward. When\r\nthe Battle is over, they take an account of the Wounded, the Dead and\r\nthe Prisoners, for Runaways they have none; and if the loss be equal on\r\nboth sides, they draw Cuts, who shall be Proclaimed Victorious.\r\n\r\n\"But though a Kingdom hath defeated the Enemy in open War, yet there\r\nis hardly any thing got by it; for there are other smaller Armies of\r\nLearned and Witty Men, on whose Disputations the Triumph or Servitude\r\nof States wholly depends.\r\n\r\n\"One Learned Man grapples with another, one Wit with another, and one\r\nJudicious Man with another Judicious Man: Now the Triumph which a State\r\ngains in this manner is reckoned as good as three Victories by open\r\nforce. After the Proclamation of Victory, the Assembly is broken up,\r\nand the Victorious People either chuse the Enemies King to be theirs,\r\nor confirm their own.\"\r\n\r\nI could not forbear to Laugh at this scrupulous way of giving Battle;\r\nand for an Example of much stronger Politicks, I alledged the Customs\r\nof our _Europe_, where the Monarch would be sure not to let slip any\r\nfavourable occasion of gaining the day; but mind what she said as to\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me, pray, if your Princes use not a pretext of Right, when they\r\nlevy Arms:\" \"No doubt,\" answered I, \"and of the Justice of their\r\nCause too.\" \"Why then,\" replied she, \"do they not chuse Impartial and\r\nUnsuspected Arbitrators to compose their Differences? And if it be\r\nfound, that the one has as much Right as the other, let things continue\r\nas they were; or let them play a game at _Picket_, for the Town or\r\nProvince that's in dispute.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why all these Circumstances,\" replied I, \"in your way of Fighting?\r\nIs it not enough, that both Armies are equal in the number of Men?\"\r\n\"Your Judgment is Weak,\" answered she. \"Would you think in Conscience,\r\nthat if you had the better of your Enemy, Hand to Hand, in an open\r\nField, you had fairly overcome him, if you had had on a Coat of Mail,\r\nand he none; if he had had but a Dagger, and you a Tuck[4]; and in a\r\nWord, if he had had but one Arm, and you both yours? Nevertheless,\r\nwhat Equality soever you may recommend to your Gladiators, they never\r\nfight on even terms; for the one will be a tall Man, and the other\r\nShort; the one skilful at his weapon, and the other a Man that never\r\nhandled a Sword; the one will be strong, and the other Weak: And though\r\nthese Disproportions were not, but that the one were as skillful and\r\nstrong as the other; yet still they might not be rightly matched; for\r\none, perhaps, may have more Courage than the other, who being rash and\r\nhot-headed, inconcerned in danger, as not foreseeing it; of a bilious\r\nTemper, a more contracted Heart, with all the qualities that constitute\r\nCourage, (as if that, as well as a Sword, were not a Weapon which his\r\nAdversary hath not:) He makes nothing of falling desperately upon,\r\nterrifying, and killing this poor Man, who foresees the danger; who\r\nhas his Heat choked in Phlegme, and a Heart too wide to close in the\r\nSpirits in such a posture as is necessary for thawing that Ice which is\r\ncalled Cowardise. And now you praise that Man, for having killed his\r\nEnemy at odds, and praising him for his Boldness you praise him for a\r\nSin against nature; seeing such Boldness tends to its destruction. And\r\nthis puts me in mind to tell ye, that some Years ago application was\r\nmade to the Council of War for a more circumspect and conscientious\r\nRule to be made, as to the way of Fighting. The Philosopher who gave\r\nthe advice, if I mistake it not, spake in this manner.\r\n\r\n\"You imagine, Gentlemen, that you have very equally balanced the\r\nadvantages of two Enemies, when you have chosen both Tall Men, both\r\nskillful, and both couragious: But that's not enough, seeing after all\r\nthe Conquerour must have the better on't either through his Skill,\r\nStrength, or good Fortune. If it be by Skill, without doubt he hath\r\ntaken his Adversary on the blind side, which he did not expect; or\r\nstruck him sooner than was likely, or faining to make his Pass on one\r\nside, he hath attacked him on the other: Nevertheless all this is\r\nCunning, Cheating, and Treachery, and none of these make a brave Man:\r\nIf he hath triumphed by Force, would you judge his Enemy overcome,\r\nbecause he hath been over-powered? No; doubtless, no more than you'll\r\nsay that a Man hath lost the Victory, when, overwhelm'd by a Mountain,\r\nit was not in his power to gain it: Even so, the other was not\r\novercome, because he was not in a suitable Disposition, at that nick of\r\ntime, to resist the violences of his Adversary. If Chance hath given\r\nhim the better of his Enemy, Fortune ought then to be Crowned, since he\r\nhath contributed nothing to it; and, in fine, the vanquished is no more\r\nto be blamed, than he who at Dice having thrown Seventeen, is beat by\r\nanother that throws three Sixes.'\r\n\r\n\"They confessed he was in the right; but that it was impossible,\r\naccording to humane Appearances, to remedy it; and that it was better\r\nto submit to a small inconvenience, than to open a door to a hundred of\r\ngreater Importance.\"\r\n\r\nShe entertained me no longer at that time, because she was afraid to\r\nbe found alone with me so early; not that Impudicity is a Crime in\r\nthat Country: On the contrary, except Malefactors Convicted, all Men\r\nhave power over all Women; and in the same manner, a Woman may bring\r\nher Action against a Man for refusing her: But she durst not keep\r\nme company publickly, because the Members of Council, at their last\r\nmeeting, had said, That it was chiefly the Women who gave it out that I\r\nwas a Man; which was the reason that for a long time I neither saw her,\r\nnor any other of her Sex.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Moon Not the Moon]\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, some must needs have revived the Disputes about\r\nthe Definition of my Being; for whilst I was thinking of nothing\r\nelse but of dying in my Cage, I was once more brought out to have\r\nanother Audience. I was then questioned, in presence of a great many\r\nCourtiers, upon some points of Natural Philosophy; and, as I take it,\r\nmy Answers gave some kind of Satisfaction; for the President declared\r\nto me at large his thoughts concerning the structure of the World.\r\nThey seemed to me very ingenious; and had he not traced it to its\r\nOriginal,[5] which he maintained to be Eternal, I should have thought\r\nhis Philosophy[6] more rational than our own: But as soon as I heard\r\nhim maintain a Foppery[6b] so contrary to our Faith. I broke with him;\r\nat which he did but laugh; and that obliged me to tell him, That since\r\nthey were thereabouts with it, I began again to think that their World\r\nwas but a Moon.\r\n\r\nBut then all cried, \"Don't you see here Earth, Rivers, Seas? what's\r\nall that then?\" \"No matter,\" said I, \"Aristotle assures us it is but\r\na Moon; and if you had said the contrary in the Schools, where I have\r\nbeen bred, you would have been hissed at.\" At this they all burst out\r\nin laughter; you need not ask, if it was their Ignorance that made them\r\ndo so; for in the mean time I was carried back to my Cage.\r\n\r\nBut some more passionate Doctors, being informed that I had the\r\nboldness to affirm, That the Moon, from whence I came, was a World; and\r\nthat their World was no more but a Moon, thought it might give them a\r\nvery just pretext to have me condemned to the Water, for that's their\r\nway of rooting out Hereticks. For that end, they went in a Body, and\r\ncomplained to the King, who promised them Justice; and order'd me once\r\nmore to be brought to the Bar.\r\n\r\nNow was I the third time Un-caged; and then the most Ancient spoke, and\r\npleaded against me. I do not well remember his Speech; because I was\r\ntoo much frighted to receive the tones of his Voice without disorder;\r\nand because also in declaiming, he made use of an Instrument which\r\nstunn'd me with its noise: It was a Speaking-Trumpet, which he had\r\nchosen on purpose that by its Martial Sound he might rouse them to\r\nmy death; and by that Emotion of their Spirits, hinder Reason from\r\nperforming its Office: As it happens in our Armies, where the noise of\r\nDrums and Trumpets hinders the Souldiers from minding the importance of\r\ntheir Lives.\r\n\r\nWhen he had done, I rose up to defend my Cause; but I was excused from\r\nit, by an Accident that will surprize you. Just as I had opened my\r\nMouth, a Man, who with much ado had pressed through the Crowd, fell at\r\nthe King's Feet, and a long while rouled himself upon his Back in his\r\npresence. This practice did not at all surprize me, because I knew it\r\nto be the posture they put themselves into, when they have a mind to be\r\nheard in publick: I only stopt my own Harangue, and gave Ear to his.\r\n\r\n\"Just Judges,\" said he, \"listen to me; you cannot Condemn that Man,\r\nthat Monkey or Parrot, for saying, That the Moon from whence he comes\r\nis a World; for if he be a Man, though he were not come from the\r\nMoon, since all Men are free, is not he free also to imagine what he\r\npleases? How can you constrain him not to have Visions, as well as\r\nyou? You may very well force him to say, That the Moon is not a World,\r\nbut he will not believe it for all that; for to believe a thing, some\r\npossibilities enclining more to the Yea than to the Nay, must offer to\r\nones Imagination: And unless you furnish him that Probability, or his\r\nown mind hit upon it, he may very well tell you that he believes, but\r\nstill remain an Infidel.[8]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Earth Not the Earth]\r\n\r\n\"I am now to prove, that he ought not to be condemned if you lift him\r\nin the Catalogue of Beasts.\r\n\r\n\"For suppose him to be an Animal without Reason, would it be rational\r\nin you to Condemn him for offending against it? He hath said, that the\r\nMoon is a World. Now Beasts act only by the instinct of Nature: it\r\nis Nature then that says so, and not he: To think that wise Nature,\r\nwho hath made the World and the Moon, knows not her self what it is;\r\nand that ye who have no more Knowledge but what ye derive from her,\r\nshould more certainly know it, would be very Ridiculous. But if Passion\r\nshould make you renounce your Principles, and you should suppose that\r\nNature does not guide Beasts; blush, at least, to think on't, that the\r\nCaprices of a Beast should so discompose you.\r\n\r\n\"Really, Gentlemen, should you meet with a Man come to the Years of\r\nDiscretion, who made it his business to inspect the Government of\r\n_Pismires_, giving a blow to one that had overthrown its Companion,\r\nimprisoning another that had robb'd its Neighbour of a grain of Corn,\r\nand inditing a third for leaving its Eggs; would you not think him a\r\nmad Man, to be employed in things so far below him, and to pretend to\r\ngive Laws to Animals, that never had Reason? How will you then, most\r\nVenerable Assembly, justifie your selves for being so concerned at the\r\nCaprices of that little Animal? Just Judges, I have no more to say.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he had made an end, all the Hall rung again with a kind of Musical\r\nApplause; and after all the Opinions had been canvased, during the\r\nspace of a large quarter of an hour, the King gave Sentence:\r\n\r\nThat for the future, I should be reputed to be a Man, accordingly\r\nset at liberty, and that the Punishment of being Drowned, should\r\nbe converted into a publick Disgrace (the most honourable way of\r\nsatisfying the Law in that Country) whereby I should be obliged to\r\nretract openly what I had maintained in saying, That the Moon was a\r\nWorld, because of the Scandal that the novelty of that opinion might\r\ngive to weak Brethren.\r\n\r\nThis Sentence being pronounced, I was taken away out of the Palace,\r\nrichly Cloathed; but in derision, carried in a magnificent Chariot,\r\nas on a Tribunal, which four Princes in Harness drew; and in all the\r\npublick places of the Town, I was forced to make this Declaration:\r\n\r\n\"Good People, I declare to you, That this Moon here is not a Moon, but\r\na World; and that that World below is not a World, but a Moon: This the\r\nCouncil thinks fit you should believe.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Drumming, striking; _cf_.

I was in great\r\namaze, when after I had Eyed him I found him to be my Spirit; we were\r\nan hour in embracing one another: \"Come lodge with me,\" said he, \"for\r\nif you return to Court, after a Publick Disgrace, you will not be well\r\nlookt upon: Nay more, I must tell you, that you would have been still\r\namongst the Apes yonder, as well as the _Spaniard_ your Companion,\r\nif I had not in all Companies published the vigour and force of your\r\nWit, and gained from your Enemies the protection of the great Men in\r\nyour favours.\" I ceased not to thank him all the way, till we came to\r\nhis Lodgings; there he entertained me till Suppertime with all the\r\nEngines he had set a work to prevail with my Enemies, notwithstanding\r\nthe most specious pretexts they had used for riding the Mobile,[1] to\r\ndesist from so unjust a Prosecution. But as they came to acquaint us\r\nthat Supper was upon the Table, he told me that to bear me company that\r\nevening he had invited Two Professors of the University of the Town\r\nto Sup with him: \"I'll make them,\" said he, \"fall upon the Philosophy\r\nwhich they teach in this World, and by that means you shall see my\r\nLandlord's Son: He's as Witty a Youth as ever I met with; he would\r\nprove another _Socrates_, if he could use his Parts aright, and not\r\nbury in Vice the Graces wherewith God continually visits him, by\r\naffecting a Libertinism,[2] as he does, out of a Chimerical Ostentation\r\nand Affectation of the name of a Wit. I have taken Lodgings here, that\r\nI may lay hold on all Opportunities of Instructing him:\" He said no\r\nmore, that he might give me the Liberty to speak, if I had a mind to\r\nit; and then made a sign, that they should strip me of my disgraceful\r\nOrnaments, in which I still glistered.\r\n\r\nThe Two Professors, whom we expected, entered just as I was undrest,\r\nand we went to sit down to Table, where the Cloth was laid, and where\r\nwe found the Youth he had mentioned to me, fallen to already. They\r\nmade him a low Reverence, and treated him with as much respect as a\r\nSlave does his Lord. I asked my Spirit the reason of that, who made me\r\nanswer, that it was because of his Age; seeing in that World, the Aged\r\nrendered all kind of Respect and Difference[3] to the Young; and which\r\nis far more, that the Parents obeyed their Children, so soon as by the\r\nJudgment of the Senate of Philosophers they had attained to the Years\r\nof Discretion.[4]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Why Parents Obey Children]\r\n\r\n\"You are amazed,\" continued he, \"at a Custom so contrary to that of\r\nyour Country; but it is not all repugnant to Reason: For say, in your\r\nConscience, when a brisk young Man is at his Prime in Imagining,\r\nJudging, and Acting, is not he fitter to govern a Family than a\r\nDecrepit piece of Threescore Years, dull and doting, whose Imagination\r\nis frozen under the Snow of Sixty Winters, who follows no other Guide\r\nbut what you call the Experience of happy Successes; which yet are no\r\nmore but the bare effects of Chance, against all the Rules and Oeconomy\r\nof humane Prudence? And as for Judgment, he hath but little of that\r\nneither, though the people of your World make it the Portion of Old\r\nAge: But to undeceive them, they must know, That that which is called\r\nPrudence in an Old Man is no more but a panick Apprehension, and a\r\nmad Fear of acting any thing where there is danger: So that when he\r\ndoes not run a Risk, wherein a Young Man hath lost himself; it is not\r\nthat he foresaw the Catastrophe, but because he had not Fire enough to\r\nkindle those noble Flashes, which make us dare: Whereas the Boldness\r\nof that Young Man was as a pledge of the good Success of his design;\r\nbecause the same Ardour that speeds and facilitates the execution,\r\nthrust him upon the undertaking.\r\n\r\n\"As for Execution, I should wrong your Judgment if I endeavoured to\r\nconvince it by proofs: You know that Youth alone is proper for Action;\r\nand were you not fully perswaded of this, tell me, pray, when you\r\nrespect a Man of Courage, is it not because he can revenge you on your\r\nEnemies or Oppressors? And does any thing, but meer Habit, make you\r\nconsider[5] him, when a Battalion of Seventy _Januarys_ hath frozen his\r\nBlood and chilled all the noble Heats that youth is warmed with?\r\nWhen you yield to the Stronger, is it not that he should be obliged\r\nto you for a Victory which you cannot Dispute him? Why then should\r\nyou submit to him, when Laziness hath softened his Muscles, weakened\r\nhis Arteries, evaporated his Spirits, and suckt the Marrow out of his\r\nBones? If you adore a Woman, is it not because of her Beauty? Why\r\nshould you then continue your Cringes, when Old Age hath made her a\r\nGhost, which only represents a hideous Picture of Death? In short,\r\nwhen you loved a Witty Man, it was because by the Quickness of his\r\nApprehension he unravelled an intricate Affair, seasoned the choicest\r\nCompanies with his quaint Sayings, and sounded the depth of Sciences\r\nwith a single Thought; and do you still honour him, when his worn\r\nOrgans disappoint his weak Noddle, when he is become dull and uneasy in\r\nCompany, and when he looks like an aged Fairy[6] rather than a rational\r\nMan?\r\n\r\n\"Conclude then from thence, Son, that it is fitter Young Men should\r\ngovern Families, than Old; and the rather, that according to your own\r\nPrinciples, _Hercules, Achilles, Epaminondas, Alexander_, and _Cæsar_,\r\nof whom most part died under Fourty Years of Age, could have merited\r\nno Honours, as being too Young in your account, though their Youth\r\nwas the only cause of their Famous Actions; which a more advanced Age\r\nwould have rendered ineffectual, as wanting that Heat and Promptitude\r\nthat rendered them so highly successful. But you'll tell me, that all\r\nthe Laws of your World do carefully enjoin the Respect that is due to\r\nOld Men: That's true; but it &amp; as true also, that all who made\r\nLaws have been Old Men, who feared that Young Men might justly have\r\ndispossessed them of the Authority they had usurped.\r\n\r\n\"You owe nothing to your mortal Architector, but your Body only; your\r\nSoul comes from Heaven, and Chance might have made your Father your\r\nSon, as now you are his. Nay, are you sure he hath not hindered you\r\nfrom Inheriting a Crown? Your Spirit left Heaven, perhaps with a design\r\nto animate the King of the _Romans_, in the Womb of the Empress; it\r\ncasually encountered the _Embryo_ of you by the way, and it may be to\r\nshorten its journey, went and lodged there: No, no, God would never\r\nhave razed your name out of the List of Mankind, though your Father had\r\ndied a Child. But who knows, whether you might not have been at this\r\nday the work of some valiant Captain, that would have associated you\r\nto his Glory, as well as to his Estate. So that, perhaps, you are no\r\nmore indebted to your Father--for the life he hath given you, than\r\nyou would be to a Pirate who had put you in Chains, because he feeds\r\nyou: Nay, grant he had begot you a Prince, or King; a Present loses\r\nits merit, when it is made without the Option of him who receives\r\nit. _Cæsar_ was killed, and so was _Cassius_ too: In the mean time\r\n_Cassius_ was obliged to the Slave, from whom he begg'd his Death, but\r\nso was not _Cæsar_ to his Murderers, who forced it upon him. Did your\r\nFather consult your Will and Pleasure, when he Embraced your Mother?\r\nDid he ask you, if you thought fit to see that Age, or to wait for\r\nanother; if you would be satisfied to be the Son of a Sot, or if you\r\nhad the Ambition to spring from a Brave Man? Alas, you whom alone the\r\nbusiness concerned, were the only Person not consulted in the case.\r\nMay be then, had you been shut up any where else, than in the Womb of\r\nNature's Ideas, and had your Birth been in your own Opinion, you would\r\nhave said to the _Parca_, my dear Lady, take another Spindle in your\r\nHand: I have lain very long in the Bed of Nothing, and I had rather\r\ncontinue an Hundred years still without a Being, than to Be to day,\r\nthat I may repent of it to morrow: However, Be you must, it was to no\r\npurpose for you to whimper and squall to be taken back again to the\r\nlong and darksome House they drew you out of, they made as if they\r\nbelieved you cryed for the Teat.\r\n\r\n\"These are the Reasons, at least some of them, my Son, why Parents\r\nbear so much respect to their Children: I know very well that I have\r\ninclined to the Childrens side more than in justice I ought; and that\r\nin favour of them, I have spoken a little against my Conscience. But\r\nsince I was willing to repress the Pride of some Parents, who insult\r\nover the weakness of their little Ones; I have been forced to do as\r\nthey do who to make a crooked Tree streight bend it to the contrary\r\nside, that betwixt two Conversions it may become even: Thus I have made\r\nFathers restore to their Children what they have taken from them, by\r\ntaking from them a great deal that belonged to them; that so another\r\ntime they may be content with their own. I know very well also that by\r\nthis Apology I have offended all Old men: But let them remember, that\r\nthey were Children before they were Fathers, and Young before they were\r\nOld; and that I must needs have spoken a great deal to their advantage,\r\nseeing they were not found in a Parsley-bed:[7] But, in fine, fall\r\nback, fall edge, though my Enemies draw up against my Friends, it will\r\ngo well enough still with me; for I have obliged all men, and only\r\ndisobliged but one half.\"\r\n\r\nWith that he held his tongue, and our Landlord's Son spoke in this\r\nmanner: \"Give me leave,\" said he to him, \"since by your care I am\r\ninformed of the Original, History, Customs, and Philosophy, of the\r\nWorld of this little Man; to add something to what you have said; and\r\nto prove that Children are not obliged to Parents for their Generation,\r\nbecause their Parents were obliged in Conscience to procreate them.\r\n\r\n\"The strictest Philosophy of their World acknowledges that it is better\r\nto dye, since to dye one must have lived, than not to have had a Being.\r\nNow seeing, by not giving a Being to that Nothing, I leave it in a\r\nstate worse than Death, I am more guilty in not producing, than in\r\nkilling it. In the mean time, my little Man, thou wouldst think thou\r\nhadst committed an unpardonable Parracide, shouldst thou have cut thy\r\nSons throat: It would indeed be an enormous Crime, but it is far more\r\nexecrable, not to give a Being to that which is capable of receiving\r\nit: For that Child whom thou deprivest of life for ever, hath had the\r\nsatisfaction of having enjoyed it for some time. Besides, we know that\r\nit is but deprived of it, but for some ages; but these forty poor\r\nlittle Nothings, which thou mightest have made forty good Souldiers for\r\nthe King, thou art so malicious as to deny them Life, and lettest them\r\ncorrupt in thy Reins, to the danger of an Appoplexy, which will stifle\r\nthee.\"\r\n\r\nThis Philosophy did not at all please me, which made me three or four\r\ntimes shake my head; but our Preceptor held his tongue, because Supper\r\nwas mad to be gone.\r\n\r\nWe laid our selves along, then, upon very soft Quilts, covered with\r\nlarge Carpets; and a young man that waited on us, taking the oldest of\r\nour Philosophers, led him into a little parlour apart, where my Spirit\r\ncalled to him to come back to us as soon as he had supped.\r\n\r\nThis humour of eating separately, gave me the curiosity of asking the\r\nCause of it: \"He'll not relish,\" said he, \"the steam of Meat, nor yet\r\nof Herbs, unless they die of themselves, because he thinks they are\r\nsensible of Pain.\" \"I wonder not so much,\" replied I, \"that he abstains\r\nfrom Flesh, and all things that have had a sensitive Life: For in\r\nour World the _Pythagoreans_, and even some holy _Anchorites_, have\r\nfollowed that Rule; but not to dare, for instance, cut a Cabbage, for\r\nfear of hurting it; that seems to me altogether ridiculous.\" \"And for\r\nmy part,\" answered my Spirit, \"I find a great deal of probability in\r\nhis Opinion.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Soul of Plants]\r\n\r\n\"For tell me, Is not that Cabbage you speak of, a Being existent in\r\nNature, as well as you? Is not she the common Mother of you both? Yet\r\nthe Opinion that Nature is kinder to Mankind, than to Cabbage-kind,\r\ntickles and makes us laugh: But seeing she is incapable of Passion, she\r\ncan neither love nor hate any thing; and were she susceptible of Love,\r\nshe would rather bestow her affection upon this Cabbage, which you\r\ngrant cannot offend her, than upon that Man who would destroy her, if\r\nit lay in his power.\r\n\r\n\"And moreover, Man cannot be born Innocent, being a Part of the first\r\nOffender: But we know very well, that the first Cabbage did not offend\r\nits Creator. If it be said, that we are made after the Image of the\r\nSupreme Being, and so is not the Cabbage; grant that to be true; yet\r\nby polluting our Soul, wherein we resembled Him, we have effaced that\r\nLikeness, seeing nothing is more contrary to God than Sin. If then\r\nour Soul be no longer his Image, we resemble him no more in our Feet,\r\nHands, Mouth, Forehead and Ears, than a Cabbage in its Leaves, Flowers,\r\nStalk, Pith, and Head: Do not you really think, that if this poor\r\nPlant could speak, when one cuts it, it would not say, 'Dear Brother\r\nMan, what have I done to thee that deserves Death? I never grow but in\r\nGardens, and am never to be found in desart places, where I might live\r\nin Security: I disdain all other company but thine; and scarcely am I\r\nsowed in thy Garden, when to shew thee my Goodwill, I blow, stretch out\r\nmy Arms to thee; offer thee my Children in Grain; and as a requital\r\nfor my civility, thou causest my Head to be chopt off.' Thus would a\r\nCabbage discourse, if it could speak.\r\n\r\n\"Well, and because it cannot complain, may we therefore justly do it\r\nall the Wrong which it cannot hinder? If I find a Wretch bound Hand\r\nand Foot, may I lawfully kill him, because he cannot defend himself?\r\nso far from that, that his Weakness would aggravate my Cruelty. And\r\nthough this wretched Creature be poor, and destitute of all the\r\nadvantages which we have, yet it deserves not Death; and when of all\r\nthe Benefits of a Being it hath only that of Encrease, we ought not\r\ncruelly to snatch that away from it. To massacre a Man, is not so\r\ngreat Sin, as to cut and kill a Cabbage, because one day the Man will\r\nrise again, but the Cabbage has no other Life to hope for: By putting\r\nto death a Cabbage, you annihilate it; but in killing a Man, you make\r\nhim only change his Habitations Nay, I'll go farther with you still:\r\nsince God doth equally cherish all his Works, and hath equally divided\r\nthe Benefits betwixt Us and Plants, it is but just we should have an\r\nequal Esteem for Them as for our Selves. It is true we were born first,\r\nbut in the Family of God there is no Birthright. If then the Cabbage\r\nshare not with us in the inheritance of Immortality, without doubt\r\nthat Want was made up by some other Advantage, that may make amends\r\nfor the shortness of its Being; may be by an universal Intellect, or\r\na perfect Knowledge of all things in their Causes; and it's for that\r\nReason, that the wise Mover of all things hath not shaped for it Organs\r\nlike ours, which are proper only for a simple Reasoning, not only weak,\r\nbut many times fallacious too; but others, more ingeniously framed,\r\nstronger, and more numerous, which serve to manage its Speculative\r\nExercises. You'll ask me, perhaps, when ever any Cabbage imparted those\r\nlofty Conceptions to us? But tell me, again, who ever discovered to\r\nus certain Beings, which we allow to be above us; to whom we bear no\r\nAnalogy nor Proportion, and whose Existence it is as hard for us to\r\ncomprehend, as the Understanding and Ways whereby a Cabbage expresses\r\nits self to its like, though not to us, because our senses are too dull\r\nto penetrate so far.\r\n\r\n\"_Moses_, the greatest of Philosophers, who drew the Knowledge of\r\nNature from the Fountain-Head, Nature her self, hinted this truth to us\r\nwhen he spoke of the Tree of Knowledge; and without doubt he intended\r\nto intimate to us under that Figure, that Plants, in Exclusion to\r\nMankind, possess perfect Philosophy. Remember, then, O thou Proudest\r\nof Animals! that though a Cabbage which thou cuttest sayeth not a\r\nWord, yet it pays it at Thinking; but the poor Vegetable has no fit\r\nOrgans to howl as you do, nor yet to frisk it about, and weep: Yet,\r\nit hath those that are proper to complain of the Wrong you do it, and\r\nto draw a Judgement from Heaven upon you for the Injustice. But if\r\nyou still demand of me, how I come to know that Cabbage and Coleworts\r\nconceive such pretty Thoughts? Then will I ask you, how come you to\r\nknow that they do not; and that some amongst them, when they shut up at\r\nNight, may not Compliment one another as you do, saying: Good Night,\r\nMaster _Cole-Curled-Pate_; your most humble Servant, good Master\r\n_Cabbage-Round-Head_.\"\r\n\r\nSo far was he gone on in his Discourse, when the young Lad, who had led\r\nout our Philosopher, led him in again; \"What, Supped already?\" cryed\r\nmy Spirit to him. He answered, yes, almost: The Physiognomist having\r\npermitted him to take a little more with us. Our young Landlord stayed\r\nnot till I should ask him the meaning of that Mystery; \"I perceive,\"\r\nsaid he, \"you wonder at this way of Living; know then, that in your\r\nWorld, the Government of Health is too much neglected, and that our\r\nMethod is not to be despised.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Physiognomist]\r\n\r\n\"In all Houses there is a Physiognomist entertained by the Publick,[8]\r\nwho in some manner resembles your Physicians, save that he only\r\nprescribes to the Healthful, and judges of the different manners how\r\nwe are to be Treated only according to the Proportion, Figure, and\r\nSymmetry of our Members; by the Features of the Face, the Complexion,\r\nthe Softness of the Skin, the Agility of the Body, the Sound of the\r\nVoice, and the Colour, Strength, and Hardness of the Hair. Did not you\r\njust now mind a Man, of a pretty low Stature, who ey'd you; he was the\r\nPhysiognomist of the House: Assure your self, that according as he\r\nobserved your Constitution, he hath diversified the Exhalation of your\r\nSupper: Mark the Quilt on which you lie, how distant it is from our\r\nCouches; without doubt, he judges your Constitution to be far different\r\nfrom ours; since he feared that the Odour which evaporates from those\r\nlittle Pipkins that stand under our Noses, might reach you, or that\r\nyours might steam to us; at Night, you'll see him chuse the Flowers for\r\nyour Bed with the same Circumspection.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The people, the populace. _Cf_. pp. 74 (starts with \"... without any\r\ndifficulty, and...\") and 168 (\"...

He was too much my Friend, not to start\r\nan Occasion upon the Spot: But not to trouble the Reader with the\r\nDiscourse and Entreaties that were previous to the Treaty, wherein Jest\r\nand Earnest were so wittily interwoven, that it can hardly be imitated;\r\nI'll only tell you that the Doctor, who came last, after many things,\r\nspake as follows:\r\n\r\n\"It remains to be proved, that there are infinite Worlds, in an\r\ninfinite World: Fancy to your self then the Universe as a great Animal;\r\nand that the Stars, which are Worlds, are in this great Animal, as\r\nother great Animals that serve reciprocally for Worlds to other\r\nPeoples; such as we, our Horses, &c. That we in our turns, are\r\nlikewise Worlds to certain other Animals, incomparably less than our\r\nselves, such as Nits, Lice, Hand-worms, &c. And that these are an\r\nEarth to others, more imperceptible ones; in the same manner as every\r\none of us appears to be a great World to these little People. Perhaps\r\nour Flesh, Blood, and Spirits, are nothing else but a Contexture of\r\nlittle Animals[1] that correspond, lend us Motion from theirs, and\r\nblindly suffer themselves to be guided by our Will which is their\r\nCoachman; or otherwise conduct us, and all Conspiring together, produce\r\nthat Action which we call Life.\r\n\r\n\"For tell me, pray, is it a hard thing to be believed, that a Louse\r\ntakes your Body for a World; and that when any one of them travels\r\nfrom one of your Ears to the other, his Companions say, that he hath\r\ntravelled the Earth from end to end, or that he hath run from one\r\nPole to the other? Yes, without doubt, those little People take your\r\nHair for the Forests of their Country; the Pores full of Liquor, for\r\nFountains; Buboes and Pimples, for Lakes and Ponds; Boils, for Seas;\r\nand Defluxions, for Deluges: And when you Comb your self, forwards, and\r\nbackwards, they take that Agitation for the Flowing and Ebbing of the\r\nOcean. Doth not Itching make good what I say? What is the little Worm\r\nthat causes it but one of these little Animals, which hath broken off\r\nfrom civil Society, that it may set up for a Tyrant in its Country? If\r\nyou ask me, why are they bigger than other imperceptible Creatures? I\r\nask you, why are Elephants bigger than we? And the _Irish_-men, than\r\n_Spaniards_?\r\n\r\n\"As to the Blisters, and Scurff, which you know not the Cause of;\r\nthey must either happen by the Corruption of their Enemies, which\r\nthese little Blades have killed, or which the Plague has caused by the\r\nscarcity of Food, for which the Seditious worried one another[2] and\r\nleft Mountains of Dead Carcases rotting in the Field; or because the\r\nTyrant, having driven away on all Hands his Companions, who by their\r\nBodies stopt up the Pores of ours, hath made way out for the waterish\r\nmatter, which being extravasted out of the Sphere of the Circulation\r\nof our Blood, is corrupted. It may be asked, perhaps, why a Nit, or\r\nHand-worm, produces so many disorders: But that's easily conceived,\r\nfor as one Revolt begets another, so these little People, egg'd on by\r\nthe bad Example of their Seditious Companions, aspire severally to\r\nSovereign Command; and occasion every where War, Slaughter, and Famine.\r\n\r\n\"But you'll say, some are far less subject to Itching than others;\r\nand, nevertheless, all are equally inhabited by these little Animals,\r\nsince you say they are the Cause of our Life. That's true; for we\r\nobserve, that Phlegmatick People are not so much given to scratching as\r\nthe Cholerick; because the People sympathizing with the Climate they\r\ninhabit, are slower in a cold Body, than those others that are heated\r\nby the temper of their Region, who frisk and stir, and cannot rest in\r\na place: Thus a Cholerick Man is more delicate than a Phlegmatick;\r\nbecause being animated in many more Parts, and the Soul being the\r\nAction of these little Beasts, he is capable of Feeling in all\r\nplaces where these Cattle stir. Whereas the Phlegmatick Man, wanting\r\nsufficient Heat to put that stirring Mobile in Action, is sensible but\r\nin a few places.\r\n\r\n\"To prove more plainly that universal _Vermicularity_, you need but\r\nconsider, when you are wounded, how the Blood runs to the Sore: Your\r\nDoctors say that it is guided by provident Nature, who would succour\r\nthe parts debilitated; which might make us conclude, that, besides the\r\nSoul and Mind, there were a third intellectual Substance, that had\r\ndistinct Organs and Functions: And therefore, it seems to me far more\r\nRational to say, That these little Animals finding themselves attacked\r\nsend to demand Assistance from their Neighbours, and thus, Recruits\r\nflocking in from all Parts and the Country being too little to contain\r\nso many, they either die of Hunger or We stifled in the Press. That\r\nMortality happens when the Boil is ripe; for as an Argument that these\r\nAnimals at that time are stifled, the Flesh becomes insensible: Now,\r\nif Blood-letting, which is many times ordered to divert the Fluxion,\r\ndo any good, it is because, much being lost by the Orifice which these\r\nlittle Animals laboured to stop, they refuse their Allies Assistance,\r\nhaving no more Forces than is enough to defend themselves at home.\"\r\n\r\nThus he concluded, and when the second Philosopher perceived by all our\r\nLooks that we longed to hear him speak in his turn:\r\n\r\n\"Men,\" said he, \"seeing you are curious to instruct this little\r\nAnimal, (our like), in somewhat of the Science which we profess, I am\r\nnow dictating a Treatise which I wish he might see, because of the\r\nLight it gives to the Understanding of our Natural Philosophy; it is\r\nan Explication of the Original[3] of the World: But seeing I am in\r\nhaste to set my Bellows at work, (for to Morrow, without delay, the\r\nTown departs;) I hope you'll excuse my want of time, and I promise to\r\nsatisfie you as soon as the Town is arrived at the place whither it is\r\nto go.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Towns in the Moon]\r\n\r\nAt these words, the Landlord's Son called his Father, to know what\r\nit was a Clock? who having answered him, that it was past Eight, he\r\nasked him in a great Rage, Why he did not give him notice at Seven,\r\naccording as he had commanded him; that he knew well enough the Houses\r\nwere to be gone to Morrow; and that the City Walls were already upon\r\ntheir Journey? \"Son,\" replyed the good Man, \"since you sate down to\r\nTable, there is an Order published, That no House shall budg before\r\nnext day:\" \"That's all one,\" answered the young Man; \"you ought blindly\r\nto obey, not to examine my Orders, and only remember what I commanded\r\nyou. Quick, go fetch me your Effigies:\" So soon as it was brought, he\r\ntook hold on't by the Arm, and Whipt it a whole quarter of an Hour:\r\n\"Away you ne'er be good,\" continued he; \"as a Punishment for your\r\ndisobedience, it's my Will and Pleasure, that this day you serve for\r\na Laughing-stock to all People; and therefore I command you, not to\r\nwalk but upon two Legs, till Night.\" The Poor Man went out in a very\r\nmournful Condition, and the Young man excused to us his Passion.\r\n\r\nI had much ado, though I bit my Lip, to forbear Laughing at so pleasant\r\na Punishment; and therefore to take me off of this odd piece of\r\nPedantick Discipline, which, without doubt, would have made, me burst\r\nout at last; I prayed my Philosopher to tell me what he meant by that\r\nJourney of the Town he talked of, and if the Houses and Walls Travelled?\r\n\r\n\"Dear Stranger,\" answered he, \"we have some Ambulatory Towns, and some\r\nSedentary; the Ambulatory, as for instance this wherein now we are, are\r\nBuilt in this manner: The Architector, as you see, builds every Palace\r\nof a very light sort of Timber; supported by four Wheels underneath; in\r\nthe thickness of one of the Walls he places ten large pair of Bellows,\r\nwhose Snouts pass in a Horizontal Line through the upper Story, from\r\none Pinacle to the other; so that when Towns are to be removed from one\r\nplace to another, (for according to the Seasons they change the Air)\r\nevery one spreads a great many Sails upon one side of the House, before\r\nthe Noses of the Bellows; then having wound up a Spring to make them\r\nplay, in less than Eight days time their Houses, by the continual Puffs\r\nwhich these Windy Monsters blow, are driven, if one pleases, an Hundred\r\nLeagues and more.\r\n\r\n\"For those which we call Sedentary, they are almost like to your\r\nTowers; save that they are of Timber, and that they have a Great and\r\nStrong Skrew or Vice in the Middle, reaching from the top to the\r\nBottom; whereby they may be hoisted up or let down as People please.\r\nNow the Ground under neath is dugg as deep as the House is high; and it\r\nis so ordered, that so soon as the Frosts begin to chill the Air, they\r\nmay sink their Houses down under Ground, where they keep themselves\r\nsecure from the Severity of the Weather: But as soon as the gentle\r\nBreathings of the Spring begin to soften and qualifie the Air; they\r\nraise them above Ground again, by means of the great Skrew I told you\r\nof.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] This and the following paragraphs appear to be an anticipation of\r\nthe microbe theory.\r\n\r\n[2] Fr., \"dont les Séditieux se sont gorgés\"--with which the rebels\r\nhave filled their bellies.\r\n\r\n[3] Cf. p. 95, n. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the_ Original _of All Things; of Atomes_; _and of the Operation of the\r\nSenses_.\r\n\r\n\r\nI prayed him, since he had shew'd so much goodness, and that the Town\r\nwas not to part[1] till next day, that he would tell me somewhat of\r\nthat Original of the World, which he had mentioned not long before;\r\n\"and I promise you,\" said I, \"that in requital, so soon as I am got\r\nback to the Moon, from whence my Governour (pointing to my Spirit) will\r\ntell you that I am come, I'll spread your Renown there, by relating the\r\nrare things you shall tell me: I perceive you Laugh at that promise,\r\nbecause you do not believe that the Moon I speak of is a World, and\r\nthat I am an Inhabitant of it; but I can assure you also, that the\r\nPeople of that World, who take this only for a Moon, will Laugh at me\r\nwhen I tell them that your Moon is a World, and that there are Fields\r\nand Inhabitants in it:\"\r\n\r\nHe answered only with a smile, and spake in this manner:\r\n\r\n\"Since in Ascending to the Original of this Great A L L, we are forced\r\nto run into three or four Absurdities; it is but reasonable we should\r\nfollow the way wherein we may be least apt to stumble. I say then, that\r\nthe first Obstacle that stops us short is the Eternity of the World;\r\nand the minds of men, not being able enough to conceive it, and being\r\nno more able to imagine, that this great Universe, so lovely and so\r\nwell ordered, could have made it self, they have had their recourse\r\nto Creation: But like to him that would leap into a River for fear of\r\nbeing wet with Rain, they save themselves out of the Clutches of a\r\nDwarf, by running into the Arms of a Giant; and yet they are not safe\r\nfor all that: For that Eternity which they deny the World, because\r\nthey cannot comprehend it, they attribute it to God, as if he stood in\r\nneed of that Present, and as if it were easier to imagine it in the\r\none than in the other; for tell me, pray, was it ever yet conceived in\r\nNature, how Something can be made of Nothing? Alas! Betwixt Nothing\r\nand an Atome only, there are such infinite Disproportions, that the\r\nsharpest Wit could never dive into them; therefore to get out of this\r\ninextricable Labyrinth, you must admit of a Matter Eternal with God:\r\nBut you'll say to me, grant I should allow you that Eternal Matter; how\r\ncould that Chaos dispose and order it self? That's the thing I am about\r\nto explain to you.\r\n\r\n\"My little Animal, after you have mentally divided every little Visible\r\nBody, into an infinite many little invisible Bodies; you must imagine,\r\nThat the infinite Universe consists only of these Atomes, which are\r\nmost solid, most incorruptible, and most simple; whose Figures are\r\npartly Cubical, partly Parallelograms, partly Angular, partly Round,\r\npartly Sharp-pointed, partly Pyramidal, partly Six-cornered, and partly\r\nOval; which act all severally, according to their Various Figures: And\r\nto shew that it is so, put a very round Ivory Bowl upon a very smooth\r\nplace, and with the least touch you give it will be half a quarter of\r\nan hour before it rest: Now I say, that if it were perfectly round,\r\nas some of the Atomes I speak of are, and the Surface on which it is\r\nput perfectly smooth, it would never rest. If Art then be capable of\r\ninclining a Body to a perpetual Motion, why may we not believe that\r\nNature can do it? It's the same with the other Figures, of which the\r\nSquare requires a perpetual Rest, others an oblique Motion, others a\r\nhalf Motion, as Trepidation; and the Round, whose Nature is to move,\r\njoyning a Pyramidal, makes that, perhaps, which we call Fire; because\r\nnot only Fire is in continual Agitation, but also because it easily\r\npenetrates: Besides, the Fire hath different effects, according to\r\nthe openings and quality of the Angles, when the round Figure is\r\njoyned; for Example, The Fire of Pepper is another thing than the Fire\r\nof Sugar, the Fire of Sugar differs from that of Cinnamon; that of\r\nCinnamon, from that of the Clove; and this from the Fire of a Faggot.\r\nNow the Fire, which is the Architect of the parts and whole of the\r\nUniverse, hath driven together, and Congregated into an Oak, the\r\nquantity of Figures which are necessary for the Composition of that Oak.\r\n\r\n\"But you'll say, how could Hazard congregate into one place all the\r\nFigures that are necessary for the production of that Oak? I answer,\r\nThat it is no wonder that Matter so disposed should form an Oak, but\r\nthe wonder would have been greater, if the Matter being so disposed the\r\nOak had not been produced; had there been a few less of some Figures,\r\nit would have been an Elm, a Poplar, a Willow; and fewer of 'em still,\r\nit would have been the Sensitive Plant, an Oyster, a Worm, a Flie, a\r\nFrog, a Sparrow, an Ape, a Man. If three Dice being flung upon a Table,\r\nthere happen a Raffle of two, or all;[2] a three, a four, and a five;\r\nor two sixes, and a third in the bottom;[3] would you say, O strange!\r\nthat each Die should turn up such a chance, when there were so many\r\nothers. A Sequence of three hath happened, O strange! Two sixes turned\r\nup, and the bottom of the third, O strange! I am sure that being a man\r\nof Sense, you'll never make such Exclamations; for since there is but\r\na certain quantity of Numbers upon the Dice, it's impossible but some\r\nof them must turn up; and you wonder, after that, how matter shuffled\r\ntogether Pell-Mell, as Chance pleases, should make a Man, seeing so\r\nmany things were necessary for the Construction of his Being. You\r\nknow not then, that this Matter tending to the Fabrick of a Man hath\r\nbeen a Million of times stopt in it's Progress for forming sometimes\r\na Stone, sometimes Lead, sometimes Coral, sometimes Flower, sometimes\r\na Comet; and all because of more or less Figures, that were required\r\nfor the framing of a Man: So that it is no greater wonder, if amongst\r\ninfinite Matters, which incessantly change and stir, some have hit upon\r\nthe construction of the few Animals, Vegetables, and Minerals which\r\nwe see, than if in a Hundred Casts of the Dice, one should throw a\r\nRaffle: Nay, indeed, it is impossible, that in this hurling of things,\r\nnothing should be produced; and yet this will be always admired[4] by\r\na Blockhead, who little knows how small a matter would have made it\r\nto have been otherwise. When the great River of [Illustration bar 3]\r\nmakes a Mill to Grind, or guides the Wheels of a Clock, and the Brook\r\nof [Illustration: bar 4] only runs, and sometimes absconds, you will\r\nnot say that that River hath a great deal of Wit, because you know that\r\nit hath met with things disposed for producing such rare Feats; for\r\nhad not the Mill stood in the way, it would not have ground the Corn;\r\nhad it not met the Clock, it would not have marked the Hours: and if\r\nthe little Rivulet I speak of had met with the same Opportunities, it\r\nwould have wrought the very same Miracles. Just so it is with the Fire\r\nthat moves of it self; for finding Organs fit for the Act of Reasoning,\r\nit Reasons; when it finds only such as are proper for Sensation, it\r\nSensates; and when such as are fit for Vegetation, it Vegetates. And to\r\nprove it is so, put out but the Eyes of a Man, the Fire of whose Soul\r\nmakes him to see, and he will cease to see; just as our great Clock\r\nwill leave off to make the Hours, if the Movements of it be broken.\r\n\r\n\"In fine, these Primary and indivisible Atomes make a Circle, whereon\r\nwithout difficulty move the most perplexed Difficulties of Natural\r\nPhilosophy; not so much as even the very Operation of the Senses, which\r\nno Body hitherto hath been able to conceive, but I will easily explain\r\nby these little Bodies. Let us begin with the Sight. It deserves, as\r\nbeing the most incomprehensible, our first Essay.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Operation of the Senses]\r\n\r\n[5]\"It is performed then, as I imagine, when the Tunicles of the Eye,\r\nwhose Pores resemble those of Glass, transmitting that fiery Dust which\r\nis called Visual Rays, the same is stopt by some opacous Matter which\r\nmakes it recoil; and then, meeting in its retreat the Image of the\r\nObject that forced it back, and that Image being but an infinite number\r\nof little Bodies exhaled in an equal Superfice from the Object beheld,\r\nit pursues it to our Eye: You'll not fail to Object, I know, that Glass\r\nis an Opacous Body, and very Compact; and that nevertheless, instead of\r\nreflecting other Bodies, it lets them pass through: But I answer, that\r\nthe Pores of Glass are shaped in the same Figure as those Atomes are\r\nwhich pass through it; and as a Wheat-Sieve is not proper for Sifting\r\nof Oats, nor an Oat-Sieve to Sift Wheat; so a Box of Deal-Board,\r\nthough it be thin and lets a sound go through it, is impenetrable to\r\nthe Sight; and a piece of Chrystal, though transparent and pervious to\r\nthe Eye, is not penetrable to the Touch.\"\r\n\r\nI could not here forbear to interrupt him: \"A great Poet and\r\nPhilosopher[6] of our World,\" said I, \"hath after _Epicurus_ and\r\n_Democritus_[7] spoken of these little Bodies, in the same manner\r\nalmost as you do; and therefore, you don't at all surprise me by that\r\nDiscourse: Only tell me, I pray, as you proceed, how, according to your\r\nPrinciples, you'll explain to me the manner of drawing your Picture in\r\na Looking-Glass.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's very easie,\" replied he, \"for imagine with your self, that\r\nthose Fires of our Eyes, having passed through the Glass and meeting\r\nbehind it an Opacous Body that reverberates them, they come back the\r\nway they went; and finding those little Bodies marching in equal\r\nSuperfices upon the Glass, they repel them to our Eyes; and our\r\nImagination, hotter than the other Faculties of our Soul, attracts the\r\nmore subtile, wherewith it draws our Picture in little.\r\n\r\n\"It is as easie to conceive the Act of Hearing, and for _Brevities_\r\nsake, let us only consider it in the Harmony of a Lute, touched by the\r\nHand of a Master. You'll ask me, How can it be, that I perceive at so\r\ngreat a distance a thing which I do not see? Does there a Sponge go\r\nout of my Ears, that drinks up that Musick, and brings it back with it\r\nagain? Or does the Player beget in my Head another little Musician,\r\nwith another little Lute, who has Orders like an Eccho to sing over\r\nto me the same Airs? No; But that Miracle proceeds from this, that\r\nthe String touched, striking those little Bodies of which the Air is\r\ncomposed, drives it gently into my Brain, with those little Corporeal\r\nNothings that sweetly pierce into it; and according as the String is\r\nstretched, the Sound is high, because it more vigorously drives the\r\nAtomes; and the Organ being thus penetrated, furnisheth the Fancy\r\nwherewith to make a Representation; if too little, then our Memory not\r\nhaving as yet finished its Image, we are forced to repeat the same\r\nsound to it again; to the end it may take enough of Materials, which,\r\nfor Instance, the Measures of a _Saraband_[8] furnish it with, for\r\nfinishing the Picture of that _Saraband_; but that Operation is nothing\r\nnear so wonderful as those others, which by the help of the same Organ\r\nexcite us sometimes to Joy, sometimes to Anger.\r\n\r\n\"And this happens, when in that motion these little Bodies meet with\r\nother little Bodies within us moving in the same manner, or whose\r\nFigure renders them susceptible of the same Agitation; for then these\r\nNewcomers stir up their Landlords to move as they do; &amp; thus, when\r\na violent Air meets with the Fire of our Blood, it inclines it to the\r\nsame Motion, and animates it to a Sally, which is the thing we call\r\nHeat of Courage; if the Sound be softer, and have only force enough\r\nto raise a less Flame in greater Agitation, by leading it along the\r\nNerves, Membranes, and through the interstices of our Flesh it excites\r\nthat Tickling which is called Joy: And so it happens in the Ebullition\r\nof the other Passions, according as these little Bodies are more or\r\nless violently tossed upon us, according to the Motion they receive\r\nby the rencounter of other Agitations, and according as they find\r\nDispositions in us for motion. So much for Hearing.\r\n\r\n\"Now, I think the Demonstration of Touching will be every whit as\r\neasie, if we conceive that out of all palpable Matter there is a\r\nperpetual Emission of little Bodies, and that the more we touch them,\r\nthe more evaporates; because we press them out of the Subject it self,\r\nas Water out of a Sponge when we squeez it. The Hard make a report to\r\nthe Organ of their Hardness; the Soft, of their Softness; the Rough,\r\n&c. And since this is so, we are not so quaint in Feeling with\r\nHands used to Labour, because of the Thickness of the Skin, which\r\nbeing neither porous, nor animated, with difficulty transmits the\r\nEvaporations of Matter. Some, perhaps, may desire to know where the\r\nOrgan of Touching has its Residence. For my part, I think it is spread\r\nover all the Surface of the Body, seeing in all parts it feels: Yet\r\nI imagine, that the nearer the Member, wherewith we touch, be to the\r\nHead, the sooner we distinguish; which Experience convinces us of, when\r\nwith shut Eyes we handle any thing, for then we'll more easily guess\r\nwhat it is; and if on the contrary we feel it with our hinder Feet,\r\nit will be harder for us to know it: And the Reason is, because our\r\nSkin being all over perforated, our Nerves, which are of no compacter\r\nMatter, lose by the way a great many of those little Atomes through the\r\nlittle Holes of their Contexture, before they reach the Brain, which\r\nis their Journeys end: It remains, that I speak of the Smelling and\r\nTasting.\r\n\r\n\"Pray tell me, when I taste a Fruit, is it not because the Heat of my\r\nMouth melts it? Confess to me then, that there being Salts in a Pear,\r\nand that they being separated by Dissolution into little Bodies of a\r\ndifferent Figure from those which make the Taste of an Apple, they must\r\nneeds pierce our Pallate in a very different manner: Just so as the\r\nthrust of a Pike, that passes through me, is not like the Wound which\r\na Pistol-Bullet makes me feel with a sudden start; and as that Pistol\r\nBullet makes me suffer another sort of Pain than that of a Slug of\r\nSteel.\r\n\r\n\"I have nothing to say, as to the Smelling, seeing the Philosophers\r\nthemselves confess, that it is performed by a continual Emission of\r\nlittle Bodies.\r\n\r\n\"Now upon the same Principle will I explain to you the Creation,\r\nHarmony, and Influence of the Celestial Globes, with the immutable\r\nVariety of Meteors.\"\r\n\r\nHe was about to proceed; but the Old Landlord coming in, made our\r\nPhilosopher think of withdrawing: He brought in Christals full of\r\nGlow-worms, to light the Parlour; but seeing those little fiery Insects\r\nlose much of their Light, when they are not fresh gathered, these which\r\nwere ten days old had hardly any at all. My Spirit stayed not till the\r\nCompany should complain of it, but went up to his Chamber, and came\r\nimmediately back again with two Bowls of Fire so Sparkling that all\r\nwondred he burnt not his Fingers. \"These incombustible Tapers,\" said\r\nhe, \"will serve us better than your Week[9] of Worms. They are Rays of\r\nthe Sun, which I have purged from their Heat; otherwise, the corrosive\r\nqualities of their Fire would have dazzled and offended your Eyes;\r\nI have fixed their Light, and inclosed it within these transparent\r\nBowls.[10] That ought not to afford you any great Cause of Admiration;\r\nfor it is not harder for me, who am a Native of the Sun, to condense\r\nhis Beams, which are the Dust of that World, than it is for you to\r\ngather the Atomes of the pulveriz'd Earth of this World.\"\r\n\r\nThereupon our Landlord sent a Servant to wait upon the Philosophers\r\nhome, it being then Night, with a dozen Globes of Glowworms hanging\r\nat his four Legs. As for my Preceptor and my self, we went to rest,\r\nby order of the Phisiognomist. He laid me that Night in a Chamber of\r\nViolets and Lillies, [and] ordered me to be tickled after the usual\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] _Part_ and _depart_ were interchangeable in the seventeenth\r\ncentury. _Cf_.

I'll go seriously set about the\r\nperformance of my Undertaking; and in the mean time, to entertain you,\r\nduring my Absence, I leave you here a Book, which heretofore I brought\r\nwith me from my Native Countrey; the Title of it is, _The States and\r\nEmpires of the Sun, with an Addition of the History of the Spark_.[1] I\r\nalso give you this, which I esteem much more; it is the great Work of\r\nthe Philosophers, composed by one of the greatest Wits of the Sun.[2]\r\nHe proves in it that all things are true, and shews the way of uniting\r\nPhysically the Truths of every Contradiction; as, for Example, That\r\nWhite is Black, and Black White; that one may be, and not be at the\r\nsame time; that there may be a Mountain without a Valley; that nothing\r\nis something, and that all things that are, are not; but observe,\r\nthat he proves all these unheard-of Paradoxes without any Captious or\r\nSophistical Argument.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE AUTHOR'S FLYING MACHINE.--From a 17th Century\r\nEngraving]\r\n\r\n\"When you are weary of Reading, you may Walk, or Converse with our\r\nLandlord's Son, he has a very Charming Wit; but that which I dislike\r\nin him is, that he is a little Atheistical. If he chance to Scandalize\r\nyou, or by any Argument shake your Faith, fail not immediately to come\r\nand propose it to me, and I'll clear the Difficulties of it; any other,\r\nbut I, would enjoin you to break Company with him; but since he is\r\nextreamly proud and conceited, I am certain he would take your flight\r\nfor a Defeat, and would believe your Faith to be grounded on no Reason,\r\nif you refused to hear his.\"\r\n\r\nHaving said so, he left me; and no sooner was his back turned, but I\r\nfell to consider attentively my Books and their Boxes, that's to say,\r\ntheir Covers, which seemed to me to be wonderfully Rich; the one was\r\ncut of a single Diamond, incomparably more resplendent than ours; the\r\nsecond looked like a prodigious great Pearl, cloven in two. My Spirit\r\nhad translated those Books into the Language of that World; but because\r\nI have none of their Print, I'll now explain to you the Fashion of\r\nthese two Volumes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Books in the Moon]\r\n\r\nAs I opened the Box, I found within somewhat of Metal, almost like to\r\nour Clocks, full of I know not what little Springs and imperceptible\r\nEngines: It was a Book, indeed; but a Strange and Wonderful Book, that\r\nhad neither Leaves nor Letters: In fine, it was a Book made wholly for\r\nthe Ears, and not the Eyes. So that when any Body has a mind to read in\r\nit, he winds up that Machine with a great many Strings; then he turns\r\nthe Hand to the Chapter which he desires to hear, and straight, as from\r\nthe Mouth of a Man, or a Musical Instrument, proceed all the distinct\r\nand different Sounds,[3] which the _Lunar_ Grandees make use of for\r\nexpressing their Thoughts, instead of Language.\r\n\r\nWhen I since reflected on this Miraculous Invention, I no longer\r\nwondred that the Young--Men of that Country were more knowing at\r\nSixteen or Eighteen years Old, than the Gray-Beards of our Climate;\r\nfor knowing how to Read as soon as Speak, they are never without\r\nLectures,[4] in their Chambers, their Walks, the Town, or Travelling;\r\nthey may have in their Pockets, or at their Girdles, Thirty of these\r\nBooks, where they need but wind up a Spring to hear a whole Chapter,\r\nand so more, if they have a mind to hear the Book quite through; so\r\nthat you never want the Company of all the great Men, living and Dead,\r\nwho entertain you with Living Voices. This Present employed me about an\r\nhour; and then hanging them to my Ears, like a pair of Pendants, I went\r\na Walking; but I was hardly at End of the Street when I met a Multitude\r\nof People very Melancholy.\r\n\r\nFour of them carried upon their Shoulders a kind of a Herse, covered\r\nwith Black: I asked a Spectator, what that Procession, like to a\r\nFuneral in my Country, meant? He made me answer, that that naughty\r\n[Illustration bar 2] called so by the People because of a knock he had\r\nreceived upon the Right Knee, being convicted of Envy and Ingratitude,\r\ndied the day before; and that Twenty Years ago, the Parliament had\r\nCondemned him to die in his Bed, and then to be interred after his\r\nDeath. I fell a Laughing at that Answer. And he asking me, why? \"You\r\namaze me,\" said I, \"that that which is counted a Blessing in our World,\r\nas a long Life, a peaceable Death, and an Honourable Burial, should\r\npass here for an exemplary Punishment.\" \"What, do you take a Burial for\r\na precious thing then,\" replyed that Man? \"And, in good earnest, can\r\nyou conceive any thing more Horrid than a Corps crawling with Worms, at\r\nthe discretion of Toads which feed on his Cheeks; the Plague it self\r\nClothed with the Body of a Man? Good God! The very thought of having,\r\neven when I am Dead, my Face wrapt up in a Shroud, and a Pike-depth of\r\nEarth upon my Mouth, makes me I can hardly fetch breath. The Wretch\r\nwhom you see carried here, besides the disgrace of being thrown into\r\na Pit, hath been Condemned to be attended by an Hundred and Fifty\r\nof his Friends; who are strictly charged, as a Punishment for their\r\nhaving loved an envious and ungrateful Person, to appear with a sad\r\nCountenance at his Funeral; and had it not been that the Judges took\r\nsome compassion of him, imputing his Crimes partly to his want of Wit,\r\nthey would have been commanded to Weep there also.\r\n\r\n\"All are Burnt here, except Malefactors: And, indeed, it is a most\r\nrational and decent Custom: For we believe, that the Fire having\r\nseparated the pure from the impure, the Heat by Sympathy reassembles\r\nthe natural Heat which made the Soul, and gives it force to mount\r\nup till it arrive at some Star, the Country of certain people more\r\nimmaterial and intellectual than us; because their Temper ought to suit\r\nwith, and participate of the Globe which they inhabit.\r\n\r\n\"However, this is not our neatest way of Burying neither; for when any\r\none of our Philosophers comes to an Age, wherein he finds his Wit begin\r\nto decay, and the Ice of his years to numm the Motions of his Soul, he\r\ninvites all his Friends to a sumptuous Banquet; then having declared to\r\nthem the Reasons that move him to bid farewel to Nature, and the little\r\nhopes he has of adding any thing more to his worthy Actions, they\r\nshew him Favour; that's to say, they suffer him to Dye; or otherwise\r\nare severe to him and command him to Live. When then, by plurality of\r\nVoices, they have put his Life into his own Hands, he acquaints his\r\ndearest Friends with the day and place. These purge, and for Four and\r\nTwenty hours abstain from Eating; then being come to the House of the\r\nSage, and having Sacrificed to the Sun, they enter the Chamber where\r\nthe generous Philosopher waits for them on a Bed of State; every one\r\nembraces him, and when it comes to his turn whom he loves best, having\r\nkissed him affectionately, leaning upon his Bosom, and joyning Mouth to\r\nMouth, with his right hand he sheaths a Dagger in his Heart.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Telling the Time]\r\n\r\nI interrupted this Discourse, saying to him that told me all, That this\r\nManner of Acting much resembled the ways of some People of our World;\r\nand so pursued my Walk, which was so long that when I came back Dinner\r\nhad been ready Two Hours. They asked me, why I came so late? It is not\r\nmy Fault, said I to the Cook, who complained: I asked what it was a\r\nClock several times in the Street, but they made me no answer but by\r\nopening their Mouths, shutting their Teeth, and turning their Faces\r\nawry.\r\n\r\n\"How,\" cried all the Company, \"did not you know by that, that they\r\nshewed you what it was a Clock?\" \"Faith,\" said I, \"they might have\r\nheld their great Noses in the Sun long enough, before I had understood\r\nwhat they meant.\" \"It's a Commodity,\" said they, \"that saves them the\r\nTrouble of a Watch; for with their Teeth they make so true a Dial, that\r\nwhen they would tell any Body the Hour of the day, they do no more but\r\nopen their Lips, and the shadow of that Nose, falling upon their Teeth,\r\nlike the Gnomon of a Sun-Dial, makes the precise time.\r\n\r\n\"Now that you may know the reason, why all People in this Country have\r\ngreat Noses; as soon as a Woman is brought to Bed the Midwife carries\r\nthe Child to the _Master of the Seminary_; and exactly at the years\r\nend, the Skillful being assembled, if his Nose prove shorter than the\r\nstanding Measure, which an Alderman keeps, he is judged to be a _Flat\r\nNose_, and delivered over to be gelt. You'll ask me, no doubt, the\r\nReason of that Barbarous Custom, and how it comes to pass that we,\r\namongst whom Virginity is a Crime, should enjoyn Continence by force;\r\nbut know that we do so, because after Thirty Ages experience we have\r\nobserved, that a great Nose is the mark of a Witty, Courteous, Affable,\r\nGenerous and Liberal Man; and that a little Nose is a Sign of the\r\ncontrary:[5] Wherefore of _Flat Noses_ we make Eunuchs, because the\r\nRepublick had rather have no Children at all than Children like them.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Noses]\r\n\r\nHe was still a speaking, when I saw a man come in stark Naked; I\r\npresently sat down and put on my Hat to shew him Honour, for these\r\nare the greatest Marks of Respect, that can be shew'd to any in\r\nthat Country. \"The Kingdom,\" said he, \"desires you would give the\r\nMagistrates notice, before you return to your own World; because\r\na Mathematician hath just now undertaken before the Council, that\r\nprovided when you are returned home, you would make a certain Machine,\r\nthat he'll teach you how to do; he'll attract your Globe, and joyn it\r\nto this.\"\r\n\r\nDuring all this Discourse we went on with our Dinner; and as soon as we\r\nrose from Table, we went to take the Air in the Garden; where taking\r\nOccasion to speak of the Generation and Conception of things, he said\r\nto me, \"You must know, that the Earth, converting it self into a Tree,\r\nfrom a Tree into a Hog, and from a Hog into a Man, is an Argument that\r\nall things in Nature aspire to be Men; since that is the most perfect\r\nBeing, as being a Quintessence, and the best devised Mixture in the\r\nWorld; which alone unites the Animal and Rational Life into one. None\r\nbut a Pedant will deny me this, when we see that a Plumb-Tree, by the\r\nHeat of its Germ, as by a Mouth, sucks in and digests the Earth that's\r\nabout it; that a Hog devours the Fruit of this Tree, and converts it\r\ninto the Substance of it self; and that a Man feeding on that Hog,\r\nreconcocts that dead Flesh, unites it to himself, and makes that Animal\r\nto revive under a more Noble Species. So the Man whom you see, perhaps\r\nthreescore years ago was no more but a Tuft of Grass in my Garden;\r\nwhich is the more probable, that the Opinion of the _Pythagorean\r\nMetamorphosis_, which so many Great Men maintain, in all likelyhood has\r\nonly reached us to engage us into an Enquiry after the truth of it; as,\r\nin reality, we have found that Matter, and all that has a Vegetative\r\nor Sensitive Life, when once it hath attained to the period of its\r\nPerfection, wheels about again and descends into its Inanity, that it\r\nmay return upon the Stage and Act the same Parts over and over.\" I went\r\ndown extreamly satisfyed to the Garden, and was beginning to rehearse\r\nto my Companion what our Master had taught me; when the Physiognomist\r\ncame to conduct us to Supper, and afterwards to Rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Cyrano's own work. It is full of interesting matters, including\r\na trip through the country of the Birds, which offers many points of\r\ncomparison with Gulliver's Voyage to the country of the Houyhnhms.\r\nCyrano finally, under the guidance of Campanella, arrives at the land\r\nof the Philosophers of the Sun (compare Swift's Laputa), where he meets\r\nDescartes and Gassendi, as Gulliver does in the Laputan province of\r\nGlubbdubdrib (Voyage to Laputa, chap. viii.).\r\n\r\nCyrano's machine for reaching the sun, depicted in the illustration\r\nopposite, is best described in the words of M. Rostand's play, and\r\ncompletes our parallels with all the six means of scaling the sky\r\nwhich Cyrano there enumerates: \"Or else, I could have let the wind\r\ninto a cedar coffer, then ratified the imprisoned element by means of\r\ncunningly adjusted burning glasses, and soared up with it.\"\r\n\r\n[2] Probably Campanella; cf. p. 78, n. 1. On his \"great work,\" _cf_.\r\nalso p. 79, n. 1. (see note 12 and 13 chap. VII.)\r\n\r\n[3] Is this an anticipation of the phonograph?\r\n\r\n[4] _Readings_. Cf. Sir Thomas Browne: \"In the lecture of Holy\r\nScripture, their apprehensions are commonly confined unto the literal\r\nsense of the text.\"\r\n\r\n[5] _Cf_. M.

A great nose is properly the index of an affable, kindly,\r\ncourteous man, witty, liberal, brave, such as I am! and such as you are\r\nforevermore precluded from supposing yourself, deplorable rogue!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of Miracles; and of Curing by the Imagination._\r\n\r\n\r\nNext Morning, so soon as I awoke, I went to call up my Antagonist. \"It\r\nis,\" said I, accosting him, \"as great a Miracle to find a great Wit,\r\nlike yours, buried in Sleep, as to see Fire without Heat and Action:\"\r\nHe bore with this ugly Compliment; \"but,\" (cryed he, with a Cholerick\r\nkind of Love) \"will you never leave these Fabulous Terms? Know, that\r\nthese Names defame the Name of a Philosopher; and that seeing the wise\r\nMan sees nothing in the World, but what he conceives, and judges may\r\nbe conceived, he ought to abhor all those Expressions of Prodigies,\r\nand extraordinary Events of Nature, which Block heads have invented to\r\nexcuse the Weakness of their Understanding.\"\r\n\r\nI thought my self then obliged in Conscience, to endeavour to undeceive\r\nhim; and therefore, said I, \"Though you be very stiff and obstinate in\r\nyour Opinions, yet I have plainly seen supernatural Things happen:\"\r\n\"Say you so,\" continued he; \"you little know, that the force of\r\nImagination is able to cure all the Diseases which you attribute to\r\nsupernatural Causes, by reason of a certain natural Balsam, that\r\ncontains Qualities quite contrary to the qualities of the Diseases\r\nthat attack us; which happens, when our Imagination informed by Pain\r\nsearches in that place for the specifick Remedy, which it applies\r\nto the Poison. That's the reason, why an able Physician of your\r\nWorld advises the Patient to make use of an Ignorant Doctor whom he\r\nesteems to be very knowing, rather than of a very Skilful Physician\r\nwhom he may imagine to be Ignorant; because he fancies, that our\r\nImagination labouring to recover our Health, provided it be assisted\r\nby Remedies, is able to cure us; but that the strongest Medicines are\r\ntoo weak, when not applied by Imagination. Do you think it strange,\r\nthat the first Men of your World lived so many Ages without the least\r\nKnowledge of Physick? No. And what might have been the Cause of that,\r\nin your judgement; unless their Nature was as yet in its force, and\r\nthat natural Balsam in vigour, before they were spoilt by the Drugs\r\nwherewith Physicians consume you; it being enough then for the recovery\r\nof ones Health, earnestly to wish for it, and to imagine himself cured:\r\nSo that their vigorous Fancies, plunging into that vital Oyl, extracted\r\nthe Elixir of it, and applying Actives to Passives, in almost the\r\ntwinkling of an Eye they found themselves as sound as before: Which,\r\nnotwithstanding the Depravation of Nature, happens even at this day,\r\nthough somewhat rarely; and is by the Multitude called a Miracle: For\r\nmy part, I believe not a jot on't, and have this to say for my self,\r\nthat it is easier for all these Doctors to be mistaken, than that the\r\nother may not easily come to pass: For I put the Question to them;\r\nA Patient recovered out of a Feaver, heartily desired, during his\r\nsickness, as it is like, that he might be cured, and, may be, made\r\nVows for that effect; so that of necessity he must either have dyed,\r\ncontinued sick, or recovered: Had he died, then would it have been\r\nsaid, kind Heaven hath put an end to his Pains; Nay, and that according\r\nto his Prayers, he was now cured of all Diseases, praised be the Lord:\r\nHad his Sickness continued, one would have said, he wanted Faith;\r\nbut because he is cured, it's a Miracle forsooth. Is it not far more\r\nlikely, that his Fancy, being excited by violent Desires, hath done\r\nits Duty and wrought the Cure? For grant he hath escaped, what then?\r\nmust it needs be a Miracle? How many have we seen, pray, and after many\r\nsolemn Vows and Protestations, go to pot with all their fair Promises\r\nand Resolutions.\"\r\n\r\n\"But at least,\" replied I to him, \"if what you say of that Balsam be\r\ntrue, it is a mark of the Rationality of our Soul; seeing without the\r\nhelp of our Reason, or the Concurrence of our Will, she Acts of her\r\nself; as if being without us, she applied the Active to the Passive.\r\nNow if being separated from us she is Rational, it necessarily follows\r\nthat she is Spiritual; and if you acknowledge her to be Spiritual, I\r\nconclude she is immortal; seeing Death happens to Animals, only by the\r\nchanging of Forms, of which Matter alone is capable.\"\r\n\r\nThe Young Man at that, decently sitting down upon his Bed, and making\r\nme also to sit, discoursed, as I remember, in this manner: \"As for\r\nthe Soul of Beasts, which is Corporeal, I do not wonder they Die;\r\nseeing the best Harmony of the four Qualities may be dissolved, the\r\ngreatest force of Blood quelled, and the loveliest Proportion of\r\nOrgans disconcerted; but I wonder very much, that our intellectual,\r\nincorporeal, and immortal Soul should be constrained to dislodge and\r\nleave us, by the same Cause that makes an Ox to perish. Hath she\r\ncovenanted with our Body, that as soon as he should receive a prick\r\nwith a Sword in the Heart, a Bullet in the Brain, or a Musket-shot\r\nthrough the Chest, she should pack up and be gone? And if that Soul\r\nwere Spiritual, and of her self so Rational that being separated from\r\nour Mass she understood as well as when Clothed with a Body; why cannot\r\nBlind Men, born with all the fair advantages of that intellectual Soul,\r\nimagine what it is to see? Is it because they are not as yet deprived\r\nof Sight, by the Death of all their Senses? How! I cannot then make use\r\nof my Right Hand, because I have a Left!\r\n\r\n\"And in fine, to make a just comparison which will overthrow all that\r\nyou have said; I shall only alledge to you a Painter, who cannot work\r\nwithout his pencil: And I'll tell you, that it is just so with the\r\nSoul, when she wants the use of the Senses. Yet they have the Soul,\r\nwhich can only act imperfectly, because of the loss of one of her\r\nTools, in the course of Life, to be able then to work to Perfection,\r\nwhen after our death she hath lost them all. If they tell me, over\r\nand over again, that she needeth not these Instruments for performing\r\nher Functions, I'll tell them e'en so, That then all the Blind about\r\nthe Streets ought to be Whipt at a Carts-Arse, for playing the\r\nCounterfeits in pretending not to See a bit.\"\r\n\r\nHe would have gone on in such impertinent Arguments, had not I stopt\r\nhis Mouth, by desiring him to forbear, as he did for fear of a quarrel;\r\nfor he perceived I began to be in a heat: So that he departed, and left\r\nme admiring the People of that World, amongst whom even the meanest\r\nhave Naturally so much Wit; whereas those of ours have so little, and\r\nyet so dearly bought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the Author's Return to the Earth._\r\n\r\n\r\nAt length my Love for my Country took me off of the desire and thoughts\r\nI had of staying there; I minded nothing now but to be gone; but I saw\r\nso much impossibility in the matter, that it made me quite peevish and\r\nmelancholick. My Spirit observed it, and having asked me, What was\r\nthe reason that my Humor was so much altered? I frankly told him the\r\nCause of my Melancholy; but he made me such fair Promises concerning my\r\nReturn, that I relied wholly upon him. I acquainted the Council with my\r\ndesign; who sent for me, and made me take an Oath, that I should relate\r\nin our World, all that I had seen in that. My Passports then were\r\nexpeded, and my Spirit having made necessary Provisions for so long\r\na Voyage, asked me, What part of my Country I desired to light in? I\r\ntold him, that since most of the Rich Youths of _Paris_, once in their\r\nlife time, made a Journey to _Rome_; imagining after that that there\r\nremained no more worth the doing or seeing; I prayed him to be so good\r\nas to let me imitate them.\r\n\r\n\"But withal,\" said I, \"in what Machine shall we perform the Voyage, and\r\nwhat Orders do you think the Mathematician, who talked t'other day of\r\njoyning this Globe to ours, will give me?\" \"As to the Mathematician,\"\r\nsaid he, \"let that be no hinderance to you; for he is a Man who\r\npromises much, and performs little or nothing. And as to the Machine\r\nthat's to carry you back, it shall be the same which brought you to\r\nCourt.\" \"How,\" said I, \"will the Air become as solid as the Earth, to\r\nbear your steps? I cannot believe that.\" \"And it is strange,\" replied\r\nhe, \"that you should believe, and not believe. Pray why should the\r\nWitches of your World, who march in the Air, and conduct whole Armies\r\nof Hail, Snow, Rain, and other Meteors, from one Province into another,\r\nhave more Power than we? Pray have a little better opinion of me, than\r\nto think I would impose upon you.\" \"The truth is,\" said I, \"I have\r\nreceived so many good Offices from you, as well as _Socrates_, and the\r\nrest, for whom you have [had] so great kindness, that I dare trust my\r\nself in your hands, as now I do, resigning my self heartily up to you.\"\r\n\r\nI had no sooner said the word, but he rose like a Whirlwind, and\r\nholding me between his Arms, without the least uneasiness he made me\r\npass that vast space which Astronomers reckon betwixt the Moon and\r\nus, in a day and a halfs time; which convinced me that they tell a\r\nLye who say that a Millstone would be Three Hundred Threescore, and\r\nI know not how many years more, in falling from Heaven, since I was\r\nso short a while in dropping down from the Globe of the Moon upon\r\nthis. At length, about the beginning of the Second day, I perceived I\r\nwas drawing near our World; since I could already distinguish Europe\r\nfrom Africa, and both from Asia; when I smelt Brimstone which I saw\r\nsteaming out of a very high Mountain,[1] that incommoded me so much\r\nthat I fainted away upon it.\r\n\r\nI cannot tell what befel me afterwards; but coming to my self again,\r\nI found I was amongst Briers on the side of a Hill, amidst some\r\nShepherds, who spoke _Italian_. I knew not what was become of my\r\nSpirit, and I asked the Shepherds if they had not seen him. At that\r\nword they made the sign of the Cross, and looked upon me as if I had\r\nbeen a Devil my self: But when I told them that I was a Christian,\r\nand that I begg'd the Charity of them, that they would lead me to\r\nsome place where I might take a little rest; they conducted me into a\r\nVillage, about a Mile off; where no sooner was I come but all the Dogs\r\nof the place, from the least Cur to the biggest Mastiff, flew upon me,\r\nand had torn me to pieces, if I had not found a House wherein I saved\r\nmy self: But that hindered them not to continue their Barking and\r\nBawling, so that the Master of the House began to look upon me with\r\nan Evil Eye; and really I think, as people are very apprehensive when\r\nAccidents which they look upon to be ominous happen, that man could\r\nhave delivered me up as a Prey to these accursed Beasts, had not I\r\nbethought my self that that which madded them so much at me, was the\r\nWorld from whence I came; because being accustomed to bark at the Moon,\r\nthey smelt I was come from thence, by the scent of my Cloaths, which\r\nstuck to me as a Sea-smell hangs about those who have been long on\r\nShip-board, for some time after they come ashore. To Air myself then,\r\nI lay three or four hours in the Sun, upon a Terrass-walk; and being\r\nafterwards come down, the Dogs, who smelt no more that influence which\r\nhad made me their Enemy, left barking, and peaceably went to their\r\nseveral homes.\r\n\r\nNext day I parted for _Rome_, where I saw the ruins of the Triumphs of\r\nsome great men, as well as of Ages: I admired those lovely Relicks;\r\nand the Repairs of some of them made by the Modern. At length, having\r\nstayed there a fortnight in Company of _Monsieur de Cyrano_ my Cousin,\r\nwho advanced me Money for my Return, I went to _Civita vecchia_, and\r\nembarked in a Galley that carried me to _Marseilles_.\r\n\r\nDuring all this Voyage, my mind run upon nothing but the Wonders of\r\nthe last I made. At that time I began the Memoires of it; and after my\r\nreturn, put them into as good order, as Sickness, which confines me\r\nto Bed, would permit. But foreseeing, that it will put an end to all\r\nmy Studies, and Travels;[2] that I may be as good as my word to the\r\nCouncil of that World; I have begg'd of _Monsieur le Bret_, my dearest\r\nand most constant Friend, that he would publish them with the History\r\nof the _Republick of the Sun_, that of the _Spark_, and some other\r\nPieces of my Composing, if those who have Stolen them from us restore\r\nthem to him, as I earnestly adjure them to do.[3]\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Vesuvius.\r\n\r\n[2] Fr., \"travaux,\" _i.e._, old English _Travails_.\r\n\r\n[3] The Manuscript of the _Bibliothèque Nationale_ ends differently:\r\n\"I enquired at the port when a ship would leave for France. And when I\r\nwas embarked, my mind ran upon nothing but the Wonders of my Voyage.\r\nI admired a thousand times the Providence of God who had set apart\r\nthese naturally Infidel men in a place by themselves where they could\r\nnot corrupt his Beloved; and had punished them for their pride by\r\nabandoning them to their own self-sufficiency. Likewise I doubt not\r\nthat he has put off till now the sending of any to preach the Gospel to\r\nthem, for the very reason that he knew they would receive it ill; and\r\nso, hardening their hearts, it would serve but to make them deserve the\r\nharsher punishment in the world to come.\"\r\n\r\nThis is very likely the original ending of the work as it was\r\ncirculated in Manuscript between 1649 and 1655. In any case, the\r\nparticular thrust-and-parry used here is a favorite stroke with the\r\n\"libertins\" of the epoch in their duels against \"Les Préjugés.\" \"These\r\nare not my opinions and arguments,\" they say; \"Heaven forbid!... They\r\nonly express the ideas of my characters which of course I abhor.\" At\r\nthe same time the arguments have been stated, which was the object in\r\nview. Cyrano has several times used this method already, notably at the\r\nend of Chapter xvi.\r\n\r\nThe ending in the text above, that of all the editions, may have been\r\nsubstituted by Cyrano himself during his last illness.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's A Voyage to the Moon, by Cyrano de Bergerac",
