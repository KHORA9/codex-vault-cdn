INDEX                                                          161\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nNo other large North American land mammal is of such primary importance\r\nas the Barren Ground Caribou (_Rangifer arcticus arcticus_) as a source\r\nof food and clothing for so many primitive Eskimo and Indian tribes; no\r\nother performs such extensive and spectacular migrations; no other may\r\nbe seen in such vast herds; no other exhibits so close an approach to a\r\nGarden-of-Eden trustfulness in the presence of man. And perhaps no other\r\nis more worthy of being cherished and safeguarded in its natural haunts\r\nfor the benefit and enjoyment of future generations.\r\n\r\nThe original valid designation, in technical nomenclature, of the Barren\r\nGround Caribou of the Mackenzie-Keewatin region dates back to 1829, when\r\nSir John Richardson described it in the _Fauna Boreali-Americana_ as\r\n_Cervus tarandus_ var. _arctica_. The type locality is Fort Enterprise\r\n(about lat. 64° 30´ N., long. 113° W.), on Winter Lake, an expansion of\r\nSnare River, Mackenzie. Since the typical subspecies appears to lack a\r\ndistinguishing common name, it would seem fitting to associate with it\r\nthe name of its worthy describer; thus, Richardson's Barren Ground\r\nCaribou. The author's intimate acquaintance with the animal should have\r\nenabled him to draw up a somewhat fuller and more adequate description\r\nthan he did. Previous travelers in the Barren Grounds, among whom Samuel\r\nHearne (1795) was particularly notable, had contributed accounts of the\r\nspecies, without differentiating it from the Lapland Reindeer (_Rangifer\r\ntarandus_) or without giving it a distinctive technical name.\r\n\r\nSince Richardson's time the mainland form of western Canada has been\r\ndiscussed by many zoologists and explorers. The most comprehensive\r\naccount of its life history hitherto published is that by Seton (1929,\r\n+3+: 95-135),[1] whose personal experience was gained in the region of\r\nArtillery, Clinton-Colden, and Aylmer lakes. Dearth of adequate material\r\n(particularly from the type locality or adjacent areas) makes it all but\r\nimpossible to determine whether there is any significant geographical\r\nvariation between the herds of central Mackenzie and those of Keewatin.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: This statement, written long before the appearance\r\n    of Banfield's work of 1954, no longer applies.]\r\n\r\nThe foremost objective of an expedition I made in 1947 to Nueltin Lake,\r\nin southwestern Keewatin, was a study of the Barren Ground Caribou. The\r\nexpedition was supported by the Arctic Institute of North America, with\r\nfunds supplied by the Office of Naval Research. My headquarters were at\r\nthe little Windy River trading post, at the northwestern extremity of\r\nNueltin Lake (map 1). There, for a period of six months, I enjoyed the\r\nfine hospitality of Charles Schweder and Fred Schweder, Jr. They had\r\nlived on intimate terms with the Caribou during most of their youthful\r\nlives, and they freely shared with me the knowledge they had thus gained\r\nconcerning the ways of life of these wonderful creatures. They secured\r\nnearly all the specimens that went into my collection. The three other\r\nresidents of the post also deserve my gratitude for their general\r\nhelpfulness and friendliness; they were 10-year-old Mike Schweder\r\n(brother of Charles and Fred), 15-year-old Anoteelik (an Eskimo boy),\r\nand the latter's sister, 5-year-old Rita.\r\n\r\nIn a previous paper (1953) I have endeavored to express to various\r\nofficials and friends my sincere appreciation of their courtesy and\r\ngenerosity in furthering the work of the expedition; and I can scarcely\r\nforbear to repeat here the names of at least a few of them: Dr. A. L.\r\nWashburn, at that time executive director of the Arctic Institute of\r\nNorth America; Mr. R. A. Gibson, deputy commissioner of the\r\nAdministration of the Northwest Territories; and Mr. G. W. Malaher,\r\ndirector of the Game and Fisheries Branch, Manitoba. For the loan of a\r\nmotion-picture camera, which secured for me some extremely gratifying\r\nscenes of the migrant hosts on the Barrens, I am greatly indebted to Mr.\r\nWilliam C. Morrow. Dr. Ralph S. Palmer has kindly read, and made helpful\r\ncomments upon, a preliminary draft of the present report.\r\n\r\nThrough the courtesy of the American Museum of Natural History, the\r\nUnited States National Museum, and the United States Fish and Wildlife\r\nService, I have been able to examine important comparative material in\r\ntheir collections.\r\n\r\nA grant from the National Science Foundation has enabled me to carry the\r\ninvestigation through to completion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMIGRATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Barren Ground Caribou is the outstanding migratory land mammal of\r\nNorth America at the present day. (Some of the bats, though extensively\r\nmigratory, obviously belong in a category too distinct for comparison.)\r\nWe know as yet extremely little concerning the movements of individual\r\nCaribou;[2] but it is fairly safe to assume that among those reaching\r\nthe southern limits of the winter range in central Manitoba or\r\nnorthwestern Ontario, there must be many whose summer range is at least\r\n500 or 600 miles to the northward. The latitudinal extent of such\r\nwanderings is comparable with, or equivalent to, an annual round trip\r\nbetween Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Charleston, South Carolina.\r\nThere is perhaps less information available concerning the migrations of\r\nthe wild Reindeer of the Old World than concerning the movements of the\r\nBarren Ground Caribou of North America (_cf._ Jacobi, 1931: 191-200).\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: One means of gathering information on this subject\r\n    would be to capture fawns as they swim across lakes or wide rivers\r\n    on the autumn migration, then to affix numbered metal tags to\r\n    their ears and to release them in time to rejoin their mothers.\r\n    This would simply be a modification of the leg-banding method\r\n    that has proved so highly successful in the study of bird\r\n    migration. It would also be particularly useful in studies on\r\n    age and growth.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Southern limits of winter range_\r\n\r\nIn years long past the winter range extended at least occasionally as\r\nfar south as Fort McMurray in Alberta and Cree Lake and the upper\r\nMudjatick and Foster rivers in Saskatchewan, and rather regularly to\r\nReindeer Lake (Preble, 1908: 137); and \"on rare occasions as far south\r\nas Cumberland House on the Saskatchewan River\" (Buchanan, 1920: 105). At\r\nan early date Richardson believed (1829: 243) that \"none\" of these\r\nCaribou \"go to the southward of Churchill.\"\r\n\r\nThere are, however, records of long ago that deal with mass occurrences\r\nof Caribou on the lower courses of the Nelson, Hayes, and Severn rivers,\r\nemptying on the west coast of Hudson Bay. The records are very puzzling\r\nin several respects. Most of them do not definitely differentiate the\r\nspecies involved from the Barren Ground Caribou, but some of them (by\r\nHearne, Richardson, and Preble) indicate that it is the Woodland\r\nCaribou. The direction of the migrations, as reported in some instances,\r\nis just the reverse of that taken at the present time by the Barren\r\nGround species during its normal movements at corresponding seasons.\r\nFinally, it is all but impossible to reconcile the numbers reported with\r\nsuch knowledge as we have of the status of the Woodland Caribou at any\r\nother period or in any other region.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the earliest account is by Dobbs (1744: 22):\r\n\r\n\"They [residents at Fort Bourbon-York Factory] also take great numbers\r\nof Cariboux or Rain-Deer [sp.?]. In _March_ and _April_ they come from\r\nthe North to the South, and extend then along the River 60 Leagues; they\r\ngo again Northward in _July_ and _August_; the Roads they make in the\r\nSnow are as well padded, and cross each other as often as the Streets in\r\nParis.\"\r\n\r\nIn discussing the \"Indian deer\" or Woodland Caribou in the vicinity of\r\nGreat Slave Lake, Hearne remarks (1795: 225): \"This is that species of\r\ndeer which are found so plentiful near York Fort and Severn River.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Thompson (1916: 100-101), an immense herd of \"Rein Deer\"\r\n[sp.?], estimated at the rather preposterous figure of 3,564,000\r\nindividuals, crossed the Hayes River 20 miles above York Factory in late\r\nMay, 1792. The direction of this migration is not indicated.\r\n\r\nRichardson writes (\"1825\": 330) of the Woodland Caribou: \"In the\r\nbeginning of September, vast numbers of this kind of deer pass near York\r\nFactory . . . on their journey towards the north-west.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again (1829: 250):\r\n\r\n\"They cross the Nelson and Severn Rivers in immense herds in the month\r\nof May, pass the summer on the low, marshy shores of James' Bay, and\r\nreturn to the northward, and at the same time retire more inland in the\r\nmonth of September. . . . I have been informed by several of the\r\nresidents at York Factory that the herds are sometimes so large as to\r\nrequire several hours to cross the river in a crowded phalanx.\"\r\n\r\nThe implication is that the herds passed _southward_ in May. It should\r\nbe borne in mind that these were apparently not personal observations of\r\nRichardson's; and in his belief that the Barren Ground species did not\r\ngo south of Churchill, he may have merely assumed that the animals in\r\nthe York Factory region were the Woodland species.\r\n\r\n\"Near York Factory, in 1831, this propensity [Indian destructiveness]\r\n. . . led to the indiscriminate destruction of a countless herd of\r\nreindeer [sp.?], while crossing the broad stream of Haye's River, in the\r\nheight of summer. . . . The deer have never since visited that part of\r\nthe country in similar numbers.\" (Simpson, 1843: 76).\r\n\r\nReferring to the York Factory region in 1837, John McLean writes\r\n(1932 [1849]: 195). \"Not many years ago this part of the country was\r\nperiodically visited by immense herds of rein-deer; at present there is\r\nscarcely one to be found.\"\r\n\r\nA later account of Richardson's (1852: 290) is somewhat ambiguous as to\r\nthe species to which it refers:\r\n\r\n\"The reindeer that visit Hudson's Bay travel southward toward James's\r\nBay in spring. In the year 1833, vast numbers of them were killed by the\r\nCree Indians at a noted pass three or four days march above York\r\nFactory. They were on their return northward, and were crossing Hayes\r\nRiver in incredible multitudes.\"\r\n\r\nPike writes (1917 [1892]: 50) that \"within the last three years [_i.e._,\r\nabout 1888] the [Barren Ground?] caribou have appeared in their\r\nthousands at York Factory . . . where they have not been seen for over\r\nthirty years.\"\r\n\r\nPreble (1902: 41) quotes Dr. Alexander Milne as thinking, after 14\r\nyears' residence at York Factory, that the small bands of \"Woodland\r\nCaribou,\" found between Churchill and Cape Churchill, form the \"northern\r\nfringe of the bands which migrate to the coast in spring, the great\r\nmajority of which in their journey cross to the south of Nelson River.\"\r\nAt that time, however, Preble (1902: 42), like Richardson before him,\r\nseems to have regarded the Churchill River as the southern limit of the\r\nBarren Ground species, and thus he may not have considered the\r\npossibility of the animals of Cape Churchill and the Nelson and Hayes\r\nrivers belonging to the same species.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to draw any sure conclusions from the confusing records\r\njust quoted. Possibly chief reliance should be placed upon the testimony\r\nof such high authorities as Hearne, Richardson, and Preble when they\r\nrefer to the animals as Woodland Caribou. Furthermore, none of the early\r\nwriters identify them unequivocally as the Barren Ground species. It\r\nremains fairly evident that long ago some species of Caribou in great\r\nnumbers did actually cross these rivers in a southerly direction in the\r\nspring, pass the summer on the coastal tundra east of York Factory, and\r\nreturn northward or northwestward in late summer or autumn. Whichever\r\nspecies it was, it represented a segment of the population that must\r\nhave become reduced to utterly insignificant numbers, if not entirely\r\nextirpated, some decades ago. In any event, it does not seem very likely\r\nthat we shall ever be able to reconstruct the actual movements of the\r\n\"incredible multitudes\" in the York Factory region of more than a\r\ncentury ago.\r\n\r\nSince the beginning of the present century, until very recent years,\r\nthere seem to have been few or no Manitoba records of _R. a. arcticus_\r\nfrom any locality so far to the southeast as York Factory. In 1947,\r\nhowever, Mr. G. W. Malaher, director of the Game and Fisheries Branch in\r\nManitoba, informed me that during the previous couple of winters the\r\nanimals had ranged southward on a broad front to the latitude of Oxford\r\nHouse, where they had not been known for 40 or 45 years. It was surmised\r\nthat the recent burning of large areas north of The Pas, resulting in\r\nthe destruction of the Caribou's normal winter food of lichens, had\r\ndeflected the animals toward the southeast and had caused them to extend\r\ntheir migration beyond its normal limit. The Split Lake band of Indians\r\n(on the Nelson River) were said to have killed 4,000 Caribou during the\r\nwinter of 1946-47, and to have used half of them for dog feed.\r\n\r\nArthur H. Lamont, in charge of the meteorological office at Fort\r\nChurchill, gave me information concerning Caribou that he had seen\r\nduring a plane flight from that point to Edmonton on March 18, 1947. At\r\nmidday he had sighted hundreds, in bands averaging 20 to 30 individuals,\r\non some little lakes, averaging a quarter of a mile in diameter, near\r\nthe southwestern end of Reindeer Lake. The animals were right in the\r\nmiddle of the frozen lakes (evidently for a noonday rest), and some of\r\nthem were lying down. They paid no attention to the plane at a height of\r\n6,000 feet, but were frightened when it came down to 200 feet. This was\r\nthe only area where Caribou were sighted during the entire flight.\r\n\r\nDuncan A. McLeod, of Winnipeg, informed me that he had seen thousands\r\nand thousands of Caribou on April 16, 1941, while he was flying from\r\nIsle à la Crosse to Beaverlodge on Lake Athabaska. They were nearer to\r\nLake Athabaska than to the starting-point. They were congregated on\r\nfrozen lakes about the middle of the day.\r\n\r\n\"Their nomadic migrations during the past 10 years have brought caribou\r\nherds during winter months to northwestern Ontario (Little Sachigo\r\nLake); central Manitoba (Cormorant, Cross, and Island Lakes); northern\r\nSaskatchewan (Churchill River); northeastern Alberta (Clearwater and\r\nAthabaska Rivers and Lake Claire)\" (Banfield, 1949: 478, fig. 1).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Spring migration in the Churchill region_\r\n\r\nThe Hudson Bay Railway is perhaps the only one in North America from\r\nwhich Barren Ground Caribou of the present subspecies have been seen. On\r\nMay 21, 1947, a passenger reported three or four of the animals near\r\nMile 326, between Gillam and Amery. Farther north, between Herchmer and\r\nChesnaye, the railway passes for perhaps 30-40 miles through the western\r\nedge of a tundra area, interspersed with small spruce timber; this is\r\nknown as the \"Little Barrens.\" It was a thrilling experience to see my\r\nfirst Caribou here, during a period of three-quarters of an hour on the\r\nafternoon of May 21, from Mile 453 to about Mile 475. There were eight\r\nbands, varying in number from 2 to 60 or 70 and averaging about 20\r\nindividuals. The first and largest band was loping away from the train,\r\nat a distance of perhaps 350 yards. A band of 9 or 10, at about 250\r\nyards, exhibited both a trotting and a loping gait. Others, as far off\r\nas half a mile or a mile and therefore less alarmed, seemed to content\r\nthemselves with trotting. They maintained a noticeably close formation\r\nwhile fleeing from the train. Yearlings, appearing only about half the\r\nsize of the adults, were readily distinguishable. The animals were in\r\nthe midst of their spring migration and were evidently moving in a\r\ngeneral northerly direction over the snow-covered Barrens. The ice of\r\nthe small lakes was still solid enough for the Caribou to trot over it.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks previously a large movement had passed through this area, as I\r\nlearned from several sources. A member of the Royal Canadian Mounted\r\nPolice detachment at Churchill, for example, had traveled through the\r\nCaribou for a distance of 15 miles without coming to the end of them; he\r\nestimated their numbers at more than 5,000. Joe Chambers, a trapper of\r\nGoose Creek, said the animals had been very plentiful in April, moving\r\ngenerally northward. He spoke of finding a good many Caribou that Wolves\r\nhad killed, contenting themselves with eating only the tongue and the\r\nunborn fawn.\r\n\r\nAccording to a railway conductor, only 12 Caribou were seen from the\r\ntrain as it passed through the Little Barrens on May 25, and none on May\r\n28.\r\n\r\nJohn Ingebrigtsen, of Churchill, reported passing a frozen lake\r\nsomewhere east of the Duck Lake Post, that was \"absolutely full\" of\r\nCaribou. It was about a mile and a half long by half a mile wide, and he\r\nestimated the number of animals at not less than 20,000. This was in the\r\nearly part of May, 1942 or 1943, when the spring migration was no doubt\r\nunder way.\r\n\r\nDuring a plane flight from Eskimo Point to Baker Lake on May 22, 1947,\r\nJohn M. Bourassa and Don Gallagher sighted numbers of Caribou, including\r\none herd of about 500. On May 28 the former saw a Caribou between\r\nChurchill and Fort Churchill. From other sources I learned that small\r\nnumbers occasionally pass along the outskirts of Churchill during the\r\nmigrations.\r\n\r\nProfessor Hazel R. Ellis (_in litt._, April 13, 1953) reports seeing\r\nseveral bands of Caribou from the train as it approached Churchill on\r\nJune 8, 1947; also a band between Churchill and Fort Churchill on June\r\n13 and 21, 1949, and a single animal on June 28, 1949, on the west side\r\nof the river near Churchill. On July 5, 1949, she filmed a herd of over\r\n40 Caribou at Bird Cove on Cape Churchill.\r\n\r\nPreble writes (1902: 41): \"Between York Factory and Fort Churchill a few\r\nsmall bands [of Woodland Caribou] are found throughout the year on the\r\n'Barrens'.\" He includes reports to this effect from several sources,\r\nincluding J. W. Tyrrell (1898). The latter, however, does not specify\r\nwhich species of Caribou his party encountered. It might be expected\r\nthat _R. a. arcticus_, rather than _R. caribou sylvestris_, would be the\r\nproper inhabitant of this tundra area. It is beyond question that the\r\nanimals seen in recent years on the \"Little Barrens\" between the\r\nChurchill and the Nelson Rivers are the Barren Ground species.\r\nFurthermore, Mr. G. W. Malaher, of the Manitoba Game and Fisheries\r\nBranch, informed me that a considerable number of this species spend the\r\nsummer and have their fawns on the Barrens in this area.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Spring migration in the Nueltin Lake region_\r\n\r\nThe general pattern of this migration, as manifested particularly about\r\nthe northwestern portion of the lake, was explained by Charles Schweder.\r\nAs a rule, practically all the local Caribou spend the winter in the\r\nwooded country to the southward. When the northward movement starts in\r\nthe spring, the does precede the bucks; they migrate through this area\r\nmostly in May (and apparently more commonly in the latter half of the\r\nmonth), but to some extent in April or even earlier. During June the\r\nmajority of the animals passing by are bucks. According to Fred\r\nSchweder, Jr., the spring migration here is more regular, less erratic,\r\nthan the fall migration.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived at Nueltin Lake on May 31, the spring migration was in\r\nfull swing; it continued through June in gradually lessening force, and\r\nthe last northbound band was seen on July 1. In the meantime many\r\ninteresting details of caribou behavior came to light.\r\n\r\nWhile flying from Churchill to Duck Lake Post on May 31, at a height of\r\nabout 500 feet, we detected three bands on the frozen surface of Seal\r\nRiver, where they were evidently taking a noonday rest. They numbered\r\napproximately 40, 20, and 6 individuals. Within 20 minutes after\r\nresuming our journey, from Duck Lake Post to Nueltin Lake, we saw four\r\nmore bands, numbering from two to a dozen individuals. Finally, just\r\nbefore landing on Windy Bay, we noticed a band of perhaps 20 crossing\r\nthe bay a mile from its head.\r\n\r\nObservations during the following 10 days showed that this was a very\r\ndefinite crossing-place for the Caribou, as if some invisible barrier on\r\neach side kept them to a certain line of march. Moreover, Charles\r\nSchweder informed me that they followed this identical route year after\r\nyear. An examination of the local topography (map 1) soon revealed the\r\nreason. The rugged south side of Windy Bay rises steeply for some 500\r\nfeet to the summit of the Windy Hills, and over a considerable distance\r\nthere are precipices and talus slopes barring the passage of such\r\nanimals as Caribou. But the mile-long South Bay, meeting Windy Bay at\r\nright angles, affords a convenient break in the hills; and the slopes\r\nthereabouts are gradual enough to be negotiated readily by the Caribou.\r\nSo here they converge from the neighboring heights, making long,\r\nslanting trails through the snow that are visible for miles; they pass\r\nout of the narrow mouth of South Bay as through a funnel, then follow\r\nthe beaten path of their predecessors across the ice of Windy Bay toward\r\nthe farther shore, until they are lost to view among a cluster of\r\nislands. It may be further remarked that their course northeastward from\r\nthe mouth of South Bay is less obstructed by islands than almost any\r\nnear-by portion of Windy Bay.\r\n\r\nFrom our camp, a mile or so distant, Caribou in bands of approximately\r\nthe following numbers were observed using this crossing-place during the\r\nearly part of June: June 1--7, 10, 18, 20, and several other bands of\r\nunrecorded size; June 2--10, 3, 7; June 3--4, 4, 10, 30, 70, and others;\r\nJune 4--3, 40?; June 5--40, 50, 75; June 6--25; June 10--8. Of course\r\nmany others must have passed while our attention was elsewhere engaged.\r\nIn most cases my records indicate the time of day when the bands were\r\ncrossing Windy Bay. The periods were mainly from 10 to 11 a.m., from\r\n2:30 to 5 p.m., and in the evening. Perhaps the infrequency of midday\r\npassages was due to the habit of the Caribou of resting at this period.\r\nOne of the last bands to pass during the evening of June 1 consisted of\r\nabout 20 individuals. Two big bucks were in the lead, and apparently a\r\nfew others were scattered along the line. At the very rear was a big,\r\nextra-dark buck, immediately preceded by a yearling barely half its\r\nsize.\r\n\r\nIn crossing the bay ice, the animals traveled habitually in long files,\r\none after the other, and yet not altogether in single file. In watching\r\nthe endlessly interesting spectacle from camp, we could not always count\r\nthe individuals exactly, for here and there a few would get abreast of\r\nothers and be partly concealed. The general formation of each band was\r\nthat of a much strung-out procession. For the most part the animals\r\nprogressed at a moderate walking gait; there were no flies to spur them\r\non at this season. On one occasion the forward element of a large band\r\nwas actually running, but those in the rear were going calmly, and there\r\nwas no visible cause of alarm. At mid-morning of June 6 most of a band\r\nof 25 were lying down to rest on the bay ice, while a few remained\r\nstanding.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Caribou in some numbers were advancing northward by crossing\r\nWindy River, the ice on which did not break up generally till June 14.\r\nOn June 3, for example, as I peeped out of my tent at 4 a.m., there was\r\na band of about 15 making a crossing a quarter of a mile above camp.\r\nLate in the afternoon several dozen did likewise close to the same\r\nplace. At this period I did not get farther upstream to note how many\r\nmight be passing there. On June 14, while the river ice was breaking up\r\nbut while the bay ice was holding firm, two bucks moved about on the\r\nlatter, just off the river's mouth. They appeared to be seeking a safe\r\ncrossing. The smaller of the two almost invariably preceded, just as if\r\nit were aware that it would be less likely to break through than its\r\ncompanion. For the most part they walked rather sedately, but now and\r\nthen took up a very leisurely trot. On the following day a dozen crossed\r\nWindy Bay at about the same place. These were the last ones seen on the\r\nice in June. Though the ice remained on the bay for some days longer, it\r\nhad evidently become unsafe.\r\n\r\nThereafter the Caribou obviously preferred the short passage of Windy\r\nRiver (no more than 50 or 60 yards wide in places) to a swim of half a\r\nmile or so across Windy Bay. So they appeared in considerable numbers on\r\nthe south bank of the river, reconnoitering for a suitable place to\r\ncross. Many were deterred by movements or sounds in our camp on the\r\nnorth bank, including the yelping invariably set up by the tethered\r\nHusky dogs whenever they would catch sight of Caribou; the latter would\r\nthen be likely either to retreat behind the ridges or to pass upstream\r\nalong the south bank. Along the half-mile extent of this bank visible\r\nfrom our camp, I noted the following making the passage of the river by\r\nswimming: June 18, a band of half a dozen; June 20, a band of three\r\nlanding practically in our dooryard and about 14 crossing at the mouth;\r\nJune 21, six crossing at the mouth; June 24, about 10 (mostly big bucks)\r\nlanding just above the camp. On the morning of July 1 a buck swam across\r\nthe bay just off the river's mouth, and a little later a band of about\r\n11--the last seen on the spring migration--were trotting upstream along\r\nthe south bank.\r\n\r\nVarious groups observed during June, principally on the south side of\r\nthe bay and the river, furnished memorable spectacles. Besides resorting\r\nto open areas on the frozen lakes and rivers for their resting periods,\r\nthe Caribou will also select some commanding hilltop for the same\r\npurpose. On June 3 a band of 75 appeared in midday on the summit of a\r\nrocky hill (\"Caribou Knoll,\" map 1) rising to a height of some 150 feet\r\non the far side of Windy River. While some kept on feeding, many of them\r\nlay down on snowbanks, apparently preferring these to the plentiful\r\npatches of bare ground, and doubtless passing the time by chewing their\r\ncuds. The velvet of the bucks' new antlers was plainly visible through\r\nfield-glasses. In the variety of their attitudes on this rocky height\r\nthe animals were disposed perhaps more like alpine Chamois than like the\r\ngenerally conceived masses of Caribou on the low Barrens. What a subject\r\nfor a Millais!\r\n\r\nIt appears likely that the higher elevations may serve for the nocturnal\r\nrest as well as for a noonday siesta. During the evening of June 1, for\r\ninstance, some 75 Caribou in a loose aggregation were feeding over the\r\nsummit of Josie's Hill, beyond the junction of Windy and South bays. On\r\nJune 20 I was enjoying a wonderfully clear and golden light that was\r\ncast on the imposing mass of this hill as the sun was setting at my back\r\nabout 9 o'clock. The glory of that scene was enhanced by picking out\r\nwith the naked eye, at a distance of a couple of miles, two separate\r\nbands of 12 to 15 Caribou making their way upward toward the broad,\r\nplateaulike summit. Meanwhile a lone Caribou was outlined against the\r\nsky on one of the rocky ridges to the south. Might not these various\r\nmovements have indicated a common urge to spend the semi-darkness of the\r\nArctic summer night on some high, open area where a good lookout for\r\nWolves could be kept?\r\n\r\nAbout 2 p.m. on June 15, a herd, perhaps half a hundred strong, appeared\r\non a ridge directly across the river from camp. The animals made a\r\nlovely spectacle as they stood for a time, despite certain human\r\nmovements in camp. Then they moved off upstream. A couple of hours later\r\nabout 15 Caribou were feeding quietly on the south bank. On the\r\nfollowing morning a band of 20 were doing likewise in nearly the same\r\nplace. Among them were a patriarchal buck (apparently the leader),\r\nseveral other bucks, various does (one with hard horns), and a large\r\nproportion of yearlings. The bucks in general were lighter in\r\ncolor--more buffy; the does and yearlings, a sort of smoke gray. They\r\nseemed to be feeding to some extent on the patches of crowberry and\r\ndwarf birch. Presently they trotted off upstream, almost but not quite\r\nin single file, for a couple marched out of line with the others.\r\n\r\nOn June 17 a band of about 20 appeared at a distance of 125 yards on the\r\nbrow of a low hill near Stump Lake. Nearly all were big bucks, with\r\nvelvety antlers up to about 20 inches in length. Perhaps three in the\r\nband were hornless--if not does, then young bucks that had very recently\r\nshed their antlers. Two of the bigger bucks were in the lead. At first\r\nthe band came toward me, then went off at a tangent at a good pace,\r\nsplashed across a little stream in a spirited action, and disappeared\r\nover the next ridge.\r\n\r\nOut of several bands appearing on June 20 on the opposite side of the\r\nriver, one of about 14 individuals came down the slope near the mouth,\r\ntook to the water at once, and made for the north shore. A strong buck\r\nlanded first, and farthest upstream; others did nearly as well, but some\r\nof the smaller animals were swept by the strong current down into the\r\nbay and probably landed beyond the point. On reaching the shore, and\r\neven some minutes afterward, several of the Caribou could be seen\r\nshaking the water from their fur in doglike fashion.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of June 21 a dozen came to the ridge across the river,\r\nbriefly inspected the camp, and retreated. In a short time they\r\nreturned, four antlered bucks in the lead, and some hornless individuals\r\nin the rear (almost in a separate band). Three of the bucks stood side\r\nby side, looking long and earnestly at the camp, while the others\r\ngrazed. Finally dissatisfied with the prospect, they made off upstream.\r\n\r\nA little before 7 p.m. on the same day six Caribou appeared on the same\r\nridge. For once the dogs were inattentive and silent. After promenading\r\nback and forth along the brow, the Caribou disappeared on the far side\r\nof the ridge; but in a few moments they were in the water at the river's\r\nmouth, in very close formation, three of them swimming abreast. There\r\nwere three good bucks and three smaller, hornless animals. After they\r\ngot ashore at the opposite point, there was wagging of tails and shaking\r\nof ears, heads, and bodies, while the water flew off in a spray. Then\r\nthey leisurely proceeded along the shore and around the point.\r\n\r\nAbout 7 p.m. on June 24 some 10 Caribou (mostly big bucks) swam the\r\nriver and landed immediately above our camp. The last two, I noted, were\r\nheading almost upstream in the current that was running 6-8 miles per\r\nhour. They swam high, with the whole line of the back 2 or 3 inches out\r\nof the water and with the antlers tilted back to keep the snout above\r\nthe surface. On landing, the animals hastened to the top of the Camp\r\nRidge and ran off along it, while the chained and frustrated dogs\r\nexpressed their feelings in the usual manner.\r\n\r\nAs I was retiring to my tent on the Camp Ridge in the twilight about\r\n11:30 p.m. on June 29, I noticed a Caribou in the opposite edge of the\r\nriver, about 125 yards away. For the most part it stood in about a foot\r\nof water and kept watching upstream. After some minutes I moved closer,\r\nright along the skyline; I waved a white pillow at it and shouted\r\nseveral times, but still it would not leave. Eventually it did move a\r\nfew feet back from the water's edge and there appeared to browse on some\r\ndwarf birches.\r\n\r\nThe next day, watching from Pile o' Rocks northwest of camp, I noticed\r\nthree Caribou passing on a northeasterly course. They walked for the\r\nmost part, but now and again trotted. They were two well-antlered bucks\r\nand a smaller individual with shorter horns. One of the former paused to\r\ngraze in a green-sprouting sedge bog. It was perhaps such fresh summer\r\nvegetation that had helped to produce fat an inch thick on the haunches\r\nof an animal secured about this date.\r\n\r\nThe area near the western border of Keewatin, lying at some distance\r\nsouth of Dubawnt Lake and west of the upper Kazan River, does not appear\r\nto attract large numbers of Caribou. Just once, in May, Charles Schweder\r\nhas found them crossing a lake which he considered Dubawnt, but may have\r\nbeen Kamiluk. In his trapping excursions in that area he has found\r\ntrails and other signs all along the way, indicating that the animals at\r\nleast pass through on their migrations.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Summer interlude_\r\n\r\nAfter July 1 no more Caribou were seen about the Windy River for five\r\nweeks. From information supplied by Charles Schweder, it appears that\r\nvirtually all of the animals desert the southern portion of the Barren\r\nGrounds at this season. Before dropping their fawns, the does pass on\r\nfor an undetermined distance to the northward of that portion of the\r\nupper Kazan River lying immediately below Ennadai Lake. The rear guard\r\nof the northward migration seems to be composed mainly of bucks and a\r\nfew barren does.\r\n\r\nA general veil of mystery seems so far to have enshrouded most of the\r\nnatal places (except the islands along the Arctic mainland coast) and\r\nthe first few weeks in the life of the Caribou fawns.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fall migration in the Nueltin Lake region_\r\n\r\nIn former times the southward migration reached the Nueltin Lake region\r\nin July (_cf._ Downes, 1943: 203-237), sometimes as early as the middle\r\nof the month. Suddenly the time of arrival shifted to (early) August,\r\nand has so remained. In Charles Schweder's experience, the bucks nearly\r\nevery year precede the does on the southward migration; this suggests\r\nthat at least the majority of the bucks may not go so far north as the\r\ndoes. In a certain year the does actually appeared first in coming\r\nsouth. In normal years, according to Fred Schweder, Jr., the migration\r\ncontinues till October or November, by which time the animals have\r\npassed into the wooded country for the winter.\r\n\r\nCharles Schweder described the general pattern of fall migration as\r\nfollows. At first two or three animals will appear, then a few more, and\r\nafter several days a big movement, lasting three or four days, will pass\r\nthrough. Thereafter the numbers dwindle, though the migration continues.\r\nCuriously enough, there is a definite retrograde movement northward into\r\nthe Barrens in September--sometimes as early as the first part of the\r\nmonth. Then there is a final movement toward the south in November, at\r\nthe time of the first good snows; the largest herds of the year may then\r\nbe seen. Just how far the migration in 1947 conformed to this pattern\r\n(outlined in early August) will be seen in the following pages.\r\n\r\nThe big August movement occurs occasionally as early as the first days\r\nof the month, whereas it was delayed till the last week in 1947. About\r\nthe first of August, 1943, according to Fred Schweder, Jr., a thousand\r\nCaribou swam across the mouth of Windy River in the course of an hour,\r\nand there were other thousands during a two weeks' period. But such a\r\nlarge migration strikes this point only once in several years. In other\r\nyears it may pass southward farther to the west, as in the vicinity of\r\nSimons' Lake.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1946--the very season when the Caribou bypassed the\r\nEskimo camps on the upper Kazan River--there were said to have been far\r\nmore than the normal numbers in the Windy River area. Thousands passed\r\nin one day, about October 10. The hills about Four-hill Creek then gave\r\nFred Schweder, Jr., the impression of \"moving with Deer.\" By comparison,\r\nthe numbers along the Windy River in 1947 were considered by the local\r\nresidents to have been below normal, however impressive they may have\r\nbeen to a zoological visitor. On the other hand, it seemed to Charles\r\nSchweder, during his trip down the Thlewiaza River in late August of\r\n1947, that Caribou were still very numerous; and he reported that people\r\nalong the west coast of Hudson Bay were then getting more of the animals\r\nthan in previous years.\r\n\r\nOnly rarely do limited numbers of Caribou remain all winter in the Windy\r\nRiver area. During Charles Schweder's years of residence there (about\r\n1936-47) the animals had done so just once--on the Windy Hills. In\r\n1946-47 Fred Schweder, Jr., found about 300 of them remaining all winter\r\nabout the north end of Ennadai Lake. He said that the locally wintering\r\nanimals are all bucks. Katello, an elderly Eskimo of the upper Kazan\r\nRiver, informed Charles Schweder that the Caribou used to remain there\r\nall winter, but now very rarely do so.\r\n\r\nBy the end of July, after both men and dogs had subsisted for several\r\nweeks on a diet devoid of caribou meat, an air of expectancy began to\r\npervade the Windy River camp. The hunters roamed the Barrens or watched\r\nfrom some lookout post such as the Pile o' Rocks (fig. 27). No Caribou\r\nwere detected during plane trips to the upper Kazan River and return on\r\nJuly 31 and August 3, though their ancient, well-marked trails were\r\nvisible along the ridges. It was not until August 6 that the first buck\r\nof the return movement was encountered. On the following day another\r\nanimal was secured. On August 10 and 11 only a few Caribou--not over 25\r\nin a band--were seen by Charles Schweder and Fred Schweder, Jr., from\r\nthe air between the Windy and the Kazan rivers. It began to be feared\r\nthat the bulk of the migration might pass somewhere to the westward. On\r\nAugust 13, however, at a distance of some miles from camp, Fred sighted\r\n20 Caribou; all of them were does and fawns except for one buck. On\r\nAugust 17 he secured a good-sized buck (specimen No. 1065; figs. 3, 4)\r\nat Bear Slough and saw five other bucks elsewhere. Two days later\r\nAnoteelik reported a band of 13.\r\n\r\nOn August 20 Fred reported about 300 Caribou moving in our direction\r\nacross the Barrens east of Lake Charles; they proved to be the advance\r\nguard of a big movement. On the same afternoon I had filmed several\r\nbucks going their separate ways on the slopes about Pile o' Rocks and\r\nStony Man. They were moving along somewhat hurriedly, in a manner very\r\ndifferent from the placid grazing of sheep or cattle. One or two does\r\nwith fawns also appeared in the vicinity. (The passage of a Keewatin\r\nTundra Wolf over the same ground a short time previously had no effect,\r\nas far as I observed, on the behavior of the animals at this time.)\r\nA grander, though more distant, spectacle gradually unfolded off to the\r\neastward, beyond Little River, where several groups, numbering from 3 to\r\n20 or 25 individuals, were feeding quietly over the open Barrens. Their\r\nfresh dark autumn coats showed up much more conspicuously than had the\r\ncream-buff of their winter coats in June. Presently the scene became\r\nlivelier, as the largest band, composed of does and fawns as well as\r\nlordly bucks, started to romp northward over the Barrens. One or more of\r\nthe various kinds of insects that bring life-long misery to the Caribou\r\nmay have stampeded them. This band swept past a group of half its size\r\nwithout at once involving it. A doe and a fawn remained lying down as\r\nthe others passed.\r\n\r\nAs the eye swept farther over that lonely land, still other Caribou were\r\ndisclosed singly or in groups scattered over a couple of square miles.\r\nThere was no strong herd instinct as they grazed at will. Even when on\r\nthe march, they straggled along, some as much as 20 to 30 yards apart.\r\nAs the sun sank lower, and the black flies became less active with the\r\ndropping temperature (about 53°), a lull ensued in the movements of the\r\nCaribou.\r\n\r\nThe big movement of the fall migration finally began to materialize on\r\nSunday, August 24. This and the next few days were filled with memorable\r\nexperiences. The throngs of Caribou passing at such times around the\r\nhead of Windy Bay and across the lowermost portions of Little and Windy\r\nrivers may be accounted for, in part, by the local topography (map 1).\r\nThe upper part of Windy Bay, occupied by numerous islands of various\r\nsizes and extending about 5 miles in an east-west direction, opposes\r\nsomething of a barrier to the Caribou in their southward trek. The\r\neasiest way to overcome this barrier is to by-pass it. So the migrant\r\nherds approaching the north shore of the bay turn westward toward Little\r\nRiver. At a point half a mile short of this stream a rather minor\r\nproportion of the Caribou actually do essay a passage of Windy Bay. They\r\ncross an island lying very close to the north shore, then steer for a\r\nsmall rocky islet a quarter of a mile northwest of the mouth of South\r\nBay. Here they get a brief respite from swimming by walking through the\r\nshallow bordering waters, then continue straight on to the rugged south\r\nshore of Windy Bay. This course is roughly parallel to, and a quarter of\r\na mile west of, the one pursued northward or northeastward across the\r\nice in the spring migration. The Caribou were seen to follow this water\r\nroute on various days from August 24 to September 8, and again on\r\nOctober 7. Like the one across the ice, it is probably a regular,\r\nwell-established, annual route.\r\n\r\nThe greater number of the migrants proceed along the north shore of the\r\nbay to Little River and are there confronted with a choice of various\r\nfurther routes. Some continue for an indefinite distance up the\r\nnortheastern bank, passing Lake Charles on their right, though other\r\nanimals, coming from the north, may be following this bank in the\r\nopposite direction. Probably most of the Caribou arriving from the\r\neastward either plunge into Little River at its mouth and swim across\r\n(figs. 9, 10, 12) or pass upstream for a bare quarter of a mile and then\r\nwade across at a rapid (figs. 7, 8).\r\n\r\nWithout human interference, a large proportion of those that cross the\r\nlower part of Little River would doubtless proceed more or less directly\r\nto Windy River and cross near its mouth. But the human and canine\r\ninhabitants of the Windy River post seem to exert a strong influence in\r\ndeflecting the Caribou northwestward along several more or less parallel\r\nridges that rise to a maximum height of 40 or 50 feet. These are Little\r\nRiver, Middle, and Camp ridges (map 1). Many animals follow the first of\r\nthese to its northwestern end, then cross a bog and ascend the Middle\r\nRidge. Some cross the southeastern end of Little River Ridge, scramble\r\ndown its steep sides by strongly marked trails (fig. 2), and then move\r\nacross the Eastern Bog to the Middle Ridge. But when they reach the\r\nsummit, they can see the post directly ahead, and generally hurry off\r\nnorthwestward along the ridge. Presently some may cross the Camp Slough\r\n(fig. 13) to the Camp Ridge and then proceed either westward or\r\nnorthwestward. The Caribou have a strong predilection for following the\r\ntreeless summits of the ridges wherever they are available and extend in\r\na more or less desirable direction. On reaching the vicinity of the Bear\r\nSlough, where the three ridges are interrupted or peter out, the animals\r\ndoubtless turn more or less southwestward to make a passage of Windy\r\nRiver at various points above its mouth. Under the conditions outlined\r\nabove, it is obvious that some of the finest opportunities for\r\nclose-range observation and photography lie at the two well-established\r\ncrossings near the mouth of Little River.\r\n\r\nOn the dark and drizzly morning of August 24 (temp. 47°-48°) I noticed a\r\nnumber of Caribou, in groups of 2 to 20, traveling northwestward along\r\nMiddle and Little River ridges. This indication of general activity\r\nenticed me to the top of the latter, whence I had a view of perhaps 8 or\r\n10 animals scattered over the Barrens beyond Little River. Several were\r\nlying down just beyond the summit of a ridge between the river and\r\nGlacier Pond, so that little more than their antlers was visible. With\r\nthe idea of finding out how closely I could approach these resting\r\nanimals, I waded knee-deep across a rapid about 100 feet in width, and\r\nworked my way up the opposite slope until I once more caught sight of\r\nthe tips of several antlers. Under cover of a rock and some dwarf\r\nbirches, I crept ahead on hands and knees, with a miniature camera at\r\nthe ready. I had arrived within 50 yards when the nearest buck got to\r\nits feet and stood looking at me. In hopes of photographing the rest\r\nwhile they were still lying down, I rose to my knees and hastily exposed\r\nthe last bit of film in the camera. Still there was no immediate\r\nreaction on the part of the Caribou. Fortunately there was a cross wind.\r\nThe first buck was so little alarmed that it leisurely sprinkled the\r\nground. But presently it turned and walked off, presumably giving some\r\nsignal of voice or posture (such as an erect tail) to the rest; for they\r\ngot to their feet, not the half a dozen I expected, but half a hundred\r\nof them! Though they trotted off toward Windy Bay, they paused within a\r\nhundred yards and turned to stare at me. Several more relieved\r\nthemselves as the first buck had done. By this time I saw that some of\r\nthe Caribou, including a little fawn, were carrying their tails quite\r\nerect, as an expression of suspicion or a signal of alarm. Evidently a\r\nmajority of the band were bucks, but there were some does, with\r\nfoot-long horns, and their fawns. On my way back to camp I noticed\r\nseveral groups of Caribou swimming across Windy Bay; perhaps they\r\nincluded the very animals I had so recently disturbed.\r\n\r\nIn the early afternoon it became evident that a further northwesterly\r\nmovement was under way along the ridges between camp and Little River.\r\nThe animals had doubtless made the passage of the river near its mouth.\r\nI followed some of them to a bog at the upper end of Little River Ridge,\r\nwhere I began to film several bucks and a lone, inquisitive, one-horned\r\ndoe. While the latter was approaching me within a hundred feet, I caught\r\na movement out of the corner of my eye, and all at once the bog seemed\r\nfull of Caribou. There were 75-100 of them, chiefly bucks, and not more\r\nthan 50 yards or so distant across the open bog. They presently moved\r\non, without haste, and ascended the Middle Ridge.\r\n\r\nSeveral hours later about 50 more Caribou passed through this bog. Then\r\na band of 17 came along, composed chiefly of does and their fawns, with\r\na couple of young bucks; they did not even turn their heads in my\r\ndirection as I stood in the open 50 yards away. Eventually a herd of\r\nabout 150 (the largest I saw during the whole season) passed along the\r\nwell-worn trails on the summit of the Middle Ridge. It seemed to include\r\nall sexes and ages, with possibly a majority of does and fawns; bringing\r\nup the rear was a limping patriarch with huge antlers, a heavy mane, and\r\na lingering winter coat.\r\n\r\nDuring the remainder of the afternoon several other groups appeared in\r\nthat general area. About 15 individuals descended Little River Ridge\r\n(fig. 2) to the Eastern Bog, but retraced their course after coming\r\nclose to several of us; they were mostly does, with four fawns and a few\r\nbucks. Another band, of all ages and sexes and numbering perhaps a\r\nhundred individuals, crossed at the rapid on Little River. The\r\ntemperatures that had prevailed during this day's marked migratory\r\nmovements varied from about 45° to 50°. They were low enough to keep the\r\nblack flies completely in abeyance, and the mosquito season was\r\nvirtually over. Although I noticed none of the parasitic flies, possibly\r\nenough of them were present to keep the Caribou moving actively against\r\na moderate to brisk northerly wind. Now and again a big buck could be\r\nseen fairly jumping out of its skin with the vigor of vibrating its\r\nsides to shake off the tormentors.\r\n\r\nOn August 25 (the second day of the big movement) I watched and filmed\r\nthe pageant of Caribou migration from the southwestern bank of Little\r\nRiver. The turfy slopes of the Barrens, carpeted with low ericaceous\r\nshrubs, mosses, and reindeer lichens, and dotted here and there with\r\nlittle thickets of dwarf birch, spruce, and tamarack, stretched\r\ninvitingly before me. Temperatures ranging from 40° to 51°, with a brisk\r\nnorthwest breeze sweeping down the river, happily suppressed most of the\r\nblack flies.\r\n\r\nThe Caribou came along at intervals from the eastward, in bands up to 75\r\nstrong, either to make the passage of the river or to continue upstream\r\nalong the opposite ridge. A small number might make the crossing in one\r\nor two files, but one of the larger bands might spread out widely in the\r\nshallow rapid. One of the photographs (fig. 7) shows approximately 75\r\nCaribou going divergent ways at this rapid: about 20 passing upstream\r\nalong the ridge on the far side, including some pausing to feed on the\r\nlow vegetation; 8 or 9 moving down the slope of the ridge to the water's\r\nedge; about 10 bucks, 16 does, and 6 fawns making the passage of the\r\nriver; and about 13 arriving on the near shore and pausing to feed. The\r\nadults were able to step across in the swift water, while the fawns swam\r\npart of the way. The bucks were apparently in the minority again on this\r\nday.\r\n\r\nOne group of some 40 does and fawns, after swimming the river near its\r\nmouth, came hurrying along the ridge in close array directly toward my\r\nstation, and did not take alarm until they had arrived within 100 feet.\r\nThen they turned tail and, each with its flag erect, beat a hasty\r\nretreat. The maneuver made a scene of considerable charm and interest.\r\nWhile I was filming a dozen Caribou in the Eastern Bog from the Middle\r\nRidge, a stray fawn came up and halted for some seconds within a rod of\r\nme. The bewildered look in its big eyes was comical though pathetic. In\r\npresently dashing on, it passed within a dozen feet.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon Fred Schweder, Jr., reported about a thousand\r\nCaribou, in various bands up to 100 strong, crossing Little River here\r\nand there a mile or so above its mouth. They were traveling southwest.\r\n\r\n  August 26 was marked by mist squalls, a maximum temperature of\r\n  45°, and a slackening in the numbers of passing Caribou. Late in\r\n  the morning a band of more than 30 bucks, does, and fawns\r\n  crossed the rapid on Little River. In the early afternoon\r\n  scattering individuals and a band of 15 or 20 did likewise.\r\n  Presently another band of about 22 animals came (fig. 8); it\r\n  consisted chiefly of does and fawns, but there were several\r\n  medium-sized bucks bringing up the rear. They crossed the rapid\r\n  in a somewhat V-shaped formation, open at the front. The\r\n  vanguard reached a rocky strip 25 yards in front of my camera\r\n  and began to feed contentedly on the low vegetation. However,\r\n  a couple of does still in the water eyed me intently and\r\n  presumably communicated their misgivings to the others, for all\r\n  turned and went back through the river without panic or haste,\r\n  although they trotted on reaching the farther shore. Later there\r\n  were about 25 Caribou crossing the bay, and nearly as many on\r\n  Little River Ridge.\r\n\r\n  The weather on August 27, while mostly sunny, included\r\n  occasional snow or sleet flurries; the northerly wind was brisk\r\n  to strong; and the temperature, ranging from 37° to 50°,\r\n  prevented the appearance of black flies. By 10:20 a.m. a band of\r\n  about 10 does and fawns crossed the rapid on Little River. Two\r\n  hours later 12-15 animals followed the same course, and\r\n  presently 75-100 passed upstream on the far side, with a good\r\n  deal of grunting. About 2:35 p.m. nearly a hundred Caribou,\r\n  perhaps alarmed by a passing plane, dashed north out of the\r\n  Eastern Bog. By 4:45 p.m. 20 or more bucks, does, and fawns swam\r\n  across Little River at its mouth; several of the biggest bucks,\r\n  with enormous antlers, led the advance into the water. An hour\r\n  later, on the eastern side of the river, half a dozen of the\r\n  animals were lying down, but with heads erect, and facing down\r\n  wind. At this period of the day several more bands of moderate\r\n  size swam over to the west side of the river. A goodly number of\r\n  the animals fed within 25 yards of me for a considerable time.\r\n\r\n  The following day was nearly cloudless; wind moderate, westerly;\r\n  temperature, 37.5° to 66°--high enough to bring out the black\r\n  flies (but extremely few mosquitoes) after several days of\r\n  virtual freedom from these scourges. Between 11:30 a.m. and 3\r\n  p.m. at least 500 Caribou, coming from the east, must have\r\n  passed the mouth of Little River, some swimming across at that\r\n  point (figs. 9, 12), and others proceeding various distances\r\n  upstream before undertaking the passage. A few of the larger\r\n  bands numbered approximately 30, 40, and 75 individuals. Some\r\n  consisted largely of does and fawns, some of big bucks. One of\r\n  the larger bands approached the river on the run, plunged in\r\n  recklessly, and landed on the western shore some 30 feet\r\n  directly in front of my battery of cameras. Most of the animals\r\n  on this and similar occasions were remarkably indifferent to me\r\n  as I operated the cameras in full view of them. Some among them\r\n  would approach within a rod or less and stare me in the face\r\n  without alarm (figs. 11, 14).\r\n\r\n  August 29 was a cloudy, nearly calm day, with temperatures\r\n  ranging from 49.5° to 73°--conditions more propitious for black\r\n  flies than for their victims. There was comparatively little\r\n  local movement among the Caribou--in the morning two or three\r\n  swimming across the bay and a band of 20 (6 old bucks, the rest\r\n  does and fawns) swimming south across the mouth of Windy River;\r\n  in mid-afternoon a band of 10 running along the ridge on the\r\n  eastern side of Little River; and about 100 reported during the\r\n  day in the vicinity of Windy Bay by Fred Schweder, Jr. The \"big\r\n  movement\" had passed its peak.\r\n\r\n  The next day was largely sunny, with a light easterly or\r\n  southeasterly wind and temperatures of 50° to 68°. There were\r\n  comparatively few black flies and fewer mosquitoes. During a\r\n  five-hour vigil near the mouth of Little River I noticed only\r\n  about 50 Caribou, most of them passing westward by ones, twos,\r\n  and intermediate numbers up to 17 (does and fawns) in a band.\r\n  Mike Schweder reported a total of about 200 animals seen within\r\n  a few miles of camp.\r\n\r\n  The morning of August 31 was dismal and overcast, with a heavy\r\n  shower; in the afternoon the sky cleared; wind brisk, south to\r\n  west; temperature, 47° to 74.5°. Several Caribou passed along\r\n  the eastern side of Little River, and Fred Schweder, Jr.,\r\n  reported about 300 some miles north of camp, moving in a\r\n  southwesterly direction.\r\n\r\n  Clouds and rain ushered in the morning of September 1; the\r\n  afternoon was sunny; wind light to strong, west to northwest;\r\n  temperature, 48° to 60°. The next day was partly cloudy, with a\r\n  mist squall or two; wind light to brisk, northwesterly;\r\n  temperature, 38° to 51.5°. No Caribou were reported on either\r\n  day.\r\n\r\n  September 3 was largely cloudy, with some mist squalls; wind\r\n  light to moderate, northerly to easterly; temperature, 40° to\r\n  51°. There were enough black flies to be slightly troublesome.\r\n  Two bucks, two does, and a fawn were noted at Bear Slough.\r\n\r\n  September 4 was partly cloudy, with drizzling rain; wind light,\r\n  east to south and southwest; temperature, 43° to 58°. I saw\r\n  about 22 Caribou (largely does and fawns), in several different\r\n  groups, at Bear Slough and vicinity, and Fred Schweder, Jr.,\r\n  reported about 200 in the same area. Two were noted swimming to\r\n  the south side of Windy Bay.\r\n\r\n  September 5 was marked by a driving, day-long rainstorm; wind\r\n  brisk, easterly; temperature, 43° to 50°. A band of about 20\r\n  Caribou (mostly does and fawns, with several middle-aged bucks),\r\n  besides one or two single animals, were encountered at Bear\r\n  Slough.\r\n\r\n  September 6 was a cloudy, raw day, with several snow flurries;\r\n  wind brisk, northerly; temperature, 33° to 35°. Not a fly was\r\n  abroad. Two Caribou moved northwest along Little River Ridge;\r\n  a band of about 75 (mainly does and fawns, but with a fair\r\n  number of big bucks) passed in the same direction along the\r\n  Middle Ridge; and about 25 others grazed along the eastern side\r\n  of Little River. Later about 15-20 more were seen about the\r\n  mouth of Little River and on a near-by island, and eight swam\r\n  across Windy Bay to the south side. Fred reported seeing about\r\n  300 during the day north and west of camp; they were moving in a\r\n  northerly direction.\r\n\r\n  It was cloudy nearly all day on September 7; wind moderate,\r\n  northerly; temperature, 33° to 40°. No black flies were in\r\n  evidence. A dozen or more Caribou took to the water from an\r\n  island in Windy Bay and made for the north shore. A band of\r\n  about 25 passed along Little River Ridge toward the river's\r\n  mouth.\r\n\r\n  September 8 was mostly cloudy; wind moderate to strong,\r\n  southeasterly; temperature, 37° to 42°. Fred reported a band of\r\n  about 100 Caribou crossing the mouth of Little River toward the\r\n  west. A dozen or more swam southward over Windy Bay at the usual\r\n  crossing-place. Anoteelik brought in 13 tongues from that many\r\n  freshly killed Caribou; he had secured them with a .22 rifle.\r\n\r\n  A driving gale from the east, with rain and sleet, continued\r\n  through the day on September 9; temperature, 36° to 37°. A\r\n  solitary buck inspected our camp from the south side of Windy\r\n  River, then retreated.\r\n\r\n  An overcast sky, with some drizzle and sleet, prevailed on\r\n  September 10; wind light, east to northeast; temperature, 35.5°\r\n  to 42.5°. No flies present for some days past. Fred reported\r\n  about 20 Caribou moving westward in the vicinity of Little\r\n  River.\r\n\r\n  On September 11 clouds and mist squalls in the morning gave way\r\n  to sunshine in the afternoon; wind light, easterly; temperature,\r\n  37° to 45.5°. Caribou were noted as follows: five on the east\r\n  side of Little River; two does and a fawn on an island in Windy\r\n  Bay; a doe and a fawn swimming northward across this bay; half a\r\n  dozen on Josie's Hill. During a flight from Churchill to Nueltin\r\n  Lake on this day, Charles Schweder detected no Caribou at all,\r\n  and concluded that the bulk of the migrating herds had by this\r\n  time passed to the southward of his course. During the latter\r\n  part of August, while descending the Thlewiaza River from\r\n  Nueltin Lake to Hudson Bay, he had seen thousands of the\r\n  animals--as many as 5,000 in a single day, although no more than\r\n  500 in a single herd.\r\n\r\n  Sun, clouds, and rain marked September 12; wind moderate to\r\n  light, south to west; temperature, 48° to 60°. Only two Caribou\r\n  were reported.\r\n\r\n  September 13 was cloudy, with intermittent mist squalls and a\r\n  little sun; wind light to brisk, northerly; temperature, 34° to\r\n  about 44°. Two bands of Caribou (of four and five animals)\r\n  appeared near the mouth of Windy River.\r\n\r\n  It was generally cloudy, with a snow squall, on September 14;\r\n  wind brisk to light, northerly; temperature, 33° to 41°. A doe\r\n  and a fawn, proceeding northward, and four or five other Caribou\r\n  appeared on the near-by ridges.\r\n\r\n  The weather was clear on the 15th, with a moderate to brisk\r\n  north wind and temperatures of 29° to 48°; ice at edge of the\r\n  river. Fred reported about 100 Caribou (none of them bucks)\r\n  north of camp, and Anoteelik secured 13 east of Little River.\r\n\r\n  On the morning of the 16th intermittent snow flurries left a\r\n  thin cover on the ground, but it was practically dissipated by\r\n  the afternoon sun; wind brisk, northerly; temperature, 30° to\r\n  39°. Fred reported three old does without fawns, and no bucks.\r\n\r\n  September 17 was mostly cloudy, with a little sun; wind light,\r\n  northwest and west; temperature, 30° to 43°. A single Caribou\r\n  was seen on the south side of Windy River.\r\n\r\n  Clear skies prevailed on September 18; wind brisk, westerly;\r\n  temperature, 35° to 53.5°; ice at edge of the river. A solitary\r\n  black fly appeared. No Caribou reported.\r\n\r\n  September 19 was another clear day; wind moderate to brisk,\r\n  west-southwest; temperature, 42° to 60°. Anoteelik, camping on\r\n  the Barrens about 2 miles to the north of camp for the past\r\n  couple of days, reports having killed 20 Caribou (only one of\r\n  them a buck).\r\n\r\n  Light rain, soon changing to sleet, and then frequent snow\r\n  squalls, provided the principal weather elements on September\r\n  20; wind light to strong, west to north; temperature, 27° to\r\n  43.5°. The ground became partly covered with snow. A big buck,\r\n  followed several hours later by a doe and a fawn, swam across to\r\n  the north side of Windy River at its mouth. Ten more Caribou\r\n  were taken by Anoteelik. Charles considered that the retrograde\r\n  movement to the north was definitely under way. There had been\r\n  indications of it on various days from September 6 on.\r\n\r\n  Except for a few snow flurries, it was largely sunny on the\r\n  21st; wind brisk to moderate, north to northwest; temperature,\r\n  26° to 34°. About a quarter of an inch of snow remained in\r\n  sheltered places. A doe and a fawn appeared near camp.\r\n\r\n  There was considerable snowfall on the 22nd; wind light to\r\n  moderate, westerly; temperature, 30° to 33°; ice in edge of the\r\n  river. A large buck left tracks in the snow along the Windy\r\n  River.\r\n\r\n  September 23 was partly cloudy; wind brisk, north-northwest;\r\n  temperature, 21° to 32°; about a quarter of an inch of snow on\r\n  the ground, and a tundra pond mostly frozen over. Several small\r\n  groups of Caribou (a doe and a fawn; three does and two fawns;\r\n  and three others) appeared on the near-by ridges.\r\n\r\n  September 24 was mostly cloudy; wind moderate to brisk,\r\n  northerly; temperature, 26° to 41°; nearly an inch of fresh snow\r\n  on the ground. About 15 does and fawns were resting or feeding\r\n  quietly on the east side of Little River, and tracks of about\r\n  half a dozen were noted on Camp Ridge. Charles Schweder reported\r\n  about 50 Caribou, in three slightly separated bands, appearing\r\n  during the evening on the south side of Windy River about 2\r\n  miles above its mouth, as if contemplating a crossing. He\r\n  thought they may have been alarmed by Wolves.\r\n\r\n  September 25 was a cloudy day; wind moderate to light, northerly\r\n  to westerly; temperature, 31° to 36°; open ground largely bare\r\n  by afternoon; ice forming on Windy Bay. Some Caribou tracks were\r\n  noted on the north side of Windy River.\r\n\r\n  There were clouds, a sprinkle or two of rain, and a little\r\n  sunshine on the 26th; wind brisk to moderate, southwest to west;\r\n  temperature, 36° to 47.5°; ground becoming practically bare.\r\n  Three Caribou were seen beyond Little River, and a doe and a\r\n  fawn on the south side of Windy River.\r\n\r\n  The 27th was mostly cloudy, with a thick snow flurry; wind\r\n  brisk, northwest; temperature, 33° to 40°. Two tundra ponds,\r\n  previously frozen, were mostly open. Three bucks, a doe, and a\r\n  fawn were noted on the south side of Windy River.\r\n\r\n  September 28 was mostly cloudy; wind brisk to light,\r\n  north-northwest; temperature, 28.5° to 40°; a little snow on the\r\n  ground disappearing. Seven large bucks (six in one band, moving\r\n  northward) passed over Camp Ridge, and a dozen other Caribou\r\n  (including does) were seen beyond Little River.\r\n\r\n  The 29th was chiefly sunny; wind very light to brisk, west to\r\n  southwest; temperature, 29° to 48°; ground bare. A band of about\r\n  15 Caribou appeared on the north side of Windy River at its\r\n  mouth. They included four large and two smaller bucks, the\r\n  remainder being does and fawns. They were apparently traveling\r\n  south.\r\n\r\n  The 30th was cloudy, with a sprinkle of rain; wind light,\r\n  westerly; temperature, 39° to 48°; ground bare. A few black\r\n  flies were brought out by the mild weather. During an\r\n  all-morning trip to Point Lake, Charles saw no Caribou, but in\r\n  the afternoon he reported about 200 on the eastern side of\r\n  Little River. There were also half a dozen bucks on the south\r\n  side of Windy River.\r\n\r\n  October 1 was a rare, fine, sunshiny day in the Barrens; wind\r\n  moderate to brisk, south to southwest; temperature, 37° to 61°;\r\n  ground bare; tundra ponds mostly ice-covered. A blowfly crawled\r\n  over a caribou carcass, and possibly a few black flies were\r\n  abroad. Two bucks passed from the shoal water of Duck Bay over\r\n  Little River Ridge. Charles reported about 40 Caribou moving\r\n  north a mile or two north of camp, and I saw a single buck\r\n  likewise engaged. During the preceding week or so Fred had seen\r\n  a good many of the animals between the upper Kazan River and\r\n  Nueltin Lake; they were moving south and west.\r\n\r\n  The 2nd was another clear day; wind moderate, southwest;\r\n  temperature, 41° to 65°; ground bare. About five does and fawns\r\n  were seen at dusk in the spruce tract near Four-hill Creek.\r\n\r\n  The next day was drizzly and foggy throughout; wind light,\r\n  southwest to southeast; temperature, 41° to 43.5°. No Caribou\r\n  sighted. Eskimos arriving in camp reported them scarce along the\r\n  way from the upper Kazan River.\r\n\r\n  October 4 was a dismal, dark day, with steady light rain\r\n  throughout; wind very light, easterly; temperature, 36° to\r\n  42.5°. Fred reported 20 Caribou north of camp.\r\n\r\n  Snow fell throughout the 5th; wind light, north-northwest;\r\n  temperature, 31° to 35°. No Caribou sighted.\r\n\r\n  With 6 inches of snow on the ground in the morning, there was\r\n  some additional precipitation during the overcast day of\r\n  October 6; wind moderate to brisk, northeast; temperature, 31°\r\n  to 33°; waters clear of ice. No Caribou sighted.\r\n\r\n  October 7 was a generally cloudy day; wind moderate to very\r\n  light, northerly; temperature, 24° to 29°; watercourses largely\r\n  open. In the morning Charles reported a couple of hundred\r\n  Caribou swimming southward across Windy Bay; he considered this\r\n  a part of the final southward movement into the timbered\r\n  country--apparently initiated by the recent snowstorm. Later he\r\n  saw an approximately equal number 2 miles north of camp, moving\r\n  toward the bay; and Fred encountered about 50 on the north side\r\n  of the bay.\r\n\r\n  Late on the 8th clouds gave way to sunshine; nearly calm to a\r\n  gentle breeze from west and southwest; temperature, 26.5° to\r\n  33.5°; 6 inches of snow on ground. I obtained a distant view of\r\n  about 100 Caribou resting near Glacier Pond. Perhaps less than a\r\n  quarter of them were old bucks; the remainder, younger bucks,\r\n  does, and fawns.\r\n\r\n  October 9 was largely sunny, with light rain in the evening;\r\n  wind light to moderate, southwest to south; temperature, 29° to\r\n  38°; ground with a 6-inch snow covering. No Caribou sighted.\r\n\r\n  Some snow fell on the 10th, though the day was partly sunny;\r\n  wind very light, south to west; temperature, 33° to 36°. No\r\n  Caribou sighted.\r\n\r\n  Clouds prevailed on the 11th; wind no more than very light,\r\n  westerly; temperature, 33° to 38°; about 4 inches of snow on\r\n  ground. Charles reported about a thousand Caribou scattered over\r\n  a long hill several miles to the northwest; they were not\r\n  traveling.\r\n\r\n  October 12 was marked by clouds, mist, and rain; wind light to\r\n  moderate, southwesterly; temperature, 32° to 40°. No Caribou\r\n  sighted.\r\n\r\n  There was a little sun on the 13th; wind light to moderate, west\r\n  to east; temperature, 37° to 45.5°; ground largely bare and\r\n  tundra ponds open. In the afternoon we set out for Simons' Lake,\r\n  and camped about 4 miles up the Windy River. No Caribou sighted.\r\n\r\n  On the 14th we reached the upper end of Simons' Lake, for a\r\n  several days' stay at a deserted trading-post. There were snow\r\n  flurries and a little rain; wind brisk, westerly; temperature,\r\n  35° to 36°; ground mostly bare. A band of about 15 Caribou,\r\n  a solitary buck, and many tracks and droppings were seen along\r\n  the way.\r\n\r\n  October 15 was partly cloudy; wind very light to light, west to\r\n  northwest and east; temperature, 21° to 36°. Four Caribou\r\n  sighted.\r\n\r\n  October 16 was a stormy, cloudy day; wind brisk, easterly;\r\n  temperature, 30.5° to 34°. About a dozen Caribou were noted in\r\n  the vicinity of Simons' Lake.\r\n\r\n  A strong easterly gale during the night, with heavy rain, was\r\n  followed during the day of the 17th by steady rain, with\r\n  moderate to light easterly or southeasterly wind; temperature,\r\n  35° to 38°. A single Caribou seen.\r\n\r\n  October 18 was partly cloudy; wind brisk to light, westerly;\r\n  temperature, 31° to 41°; waters open; some small patches of snow\r\n  in sight. Four Caribou (at least two of them bucks) passed by.\r\n\r\n  The 19th was partly cloudy; nearly calm to moderate wind, west\r\n  and northwest; temperature, 30° to 40°. About five or six bucks\r\n  (three of them together) appeared, perhaps moving south.\r\n\r\n  The weather on the 20th was raw, dismal, and gusty; wind brisk,\r\n  northwest; temperature, 27° to about 35°; some ice on Simons'\r\n  Lake; a little fresh snow on higher hills. No Caribou sighted.\r\n\r\n  October 21 was somewhat foggy; nearly calm; temperature, 25° to\r\n  32°; Simons' Lake partly frozen; ground generally bare. A lone\r\n  fawn was seen as we started on the return trip to the Windy\r\n  River post.\r\n\r\n  The 22nd was largely sunny; wind very light to brisk,\r\n  southwesterly; temperature, about 30° to 46°. A medium-sized\r\n  buck was seen near the mouth of Windy River.\r\n\r\n  The 23rd was largely cloudy; wind brisk, southwest; temperature,\r\n  35° to 39°; ground practically all bare; bay and river open.\r\n  A buck started to cross to the north side of Windy River, but\r\n  went back.\r\n\r\n  For the better part of a week, till October 29, I found no\r\n  further fresh indications of Caribou in our vicinity. In the\r\n  meantime the weather was largely cloudy, with some rain and snow\r\n  (4-5 inches of the latter on the 27th); winds very light to\r\n  moderate, swinging from east to south and west; temperature, 27°\r\n  to 50°; waters generally open.\r\n\r\n  October 29 was largely cloudy; a gentle wind, south to east;\r\n  temperature, 29° to 35°; 4-5 inches of snow on ground; thin ice\r\n  on a tundra pond. The fresh track of a buck (fig. 20) was found\r\n  near camp.\r\n\r\n  On the 30th gentle rain changed to snow; calm to a moderate\r\n  wind, northeast to north; temperature, 30° to 33°. Tracks showed\r\n  the passing of about a dozen Caribou, including half a dozen\r\n  that swam westward across the mouth of Little River, breaking\r\n  through a rim of ice at the edge.\r\n\r\n  Clouds prevailed on the 31st; wind moderate to brisk, northerly;\r\n  temperature, 17° to 25.5°; 5-6 inches of snow on ground, with\r\n  drifts up to a foot deep; river and lake open. Fred reported\r\n  three Caribou.\r\n\r\n  November 1 marked the long-delayed \"freeze-up.\" Windy Bay and\r\n  the edges of Windy River were frozen, while pieces of ice\r\n  floated down the river. The day was cloudy, with continual snow\r\n  flurries after noon; wind light to brisk, southeast;\r\n  temperature, 21° to 31°; about 6 inches of snow on ground.\r\n\r\n  The 2nd was cloudy, with some rain and sleet; wind moderate to\r\n  brisk, southeast to west; temperature, 29° to 34°. No Caribou\r\n  sighted for two days.\r\n\r\n  On the 3rd it was cloudy all day; wind light, northwest;\r\n  temperature, 16° to 20°. A herd of about 50 Caribou (largely\r\n  does, with a few fawns and well-antlered bucks) hurried down the\r\n  side of Little River Ridge onto the ice of Duck Bay, with the\r\n  apparent intention of crossing to the south side of Windy Bay;\r\n  but they were intercepted by a hunter and retreated\r\n  northwestward along the ridge. Fred secured three\r\n  southward-traveling bucks at a distance from camp.\r\n\r\n  No Caribou were sighted on the three following days (November 4\r\n  to 6), which were more or less cloudy, with some snow; wind\r\n  light to brisk, southerly to northerly; temperature, 13° to\r\n  24.5°; ice 3 inches thick on Windy Bay; about 6 inches of snow\r\n  on ground.\r\n\r\n  There was snow during the night of November 6 and the morning of\r\n  the 7th, resulting in drifts up to a yard deep; wind brisk,\r\n  northerly; temperature, -3° to 13°. Fred reported \"lots\" of\r\n  Caribou some 10 miles to the north, moving south.\r\n\r\n  The next three days (November 8 to 10) varied from cloudy (with\r\n  a snow flurry) to sunny; wind moderate to strong, northwest and\r\n  north; temperature, -10.5° to 1°; 6-8 inches of snow (much\r\n  drifted); Windy River gradually becoming ice-covered. No Caribou\r\n  sighted.\r\n\r\n  November 11 was partly sunny; wind moderate to brisk, northerly;\r\n  temperature, 3° to 6.5°; about 8 inches of snow on the average.\r\n  Mike Schweder reported five does moving south across the mouth\r\n  of Windy River on the ice.\r\n\r\n  Thereafter, until my departure on December 4, no more Caribou\r\n  were actually seen in the vicinity of the headquarters on Windy\r\n  River. There were, however, tracks of single animals on November\r\n  15 and 16. Moreover, during the period from about November 7 to\r\n  15, while traveling northward to the upper Kazan River, Charles\r\n  Schweder saw thousands of Caribou, in herds up to 300, moving\r\n  southward. He surmised that their course took them somewhere\r\n  between Ennadai and Nueltin lakes. Fred also reported many to\r\n  the northward on the 7th, as already noted. This was perhaps the\r\n  last large migratory movement of the year in our general area.\r\n  Thereafter virtually all of the animals were presumably in the\r\n  timbered area to the southward. None was sighted from the plane\r\n  during the flight to Churchill on December 4.\r\n\r\n  On November 7 the temperature had taken a sharp downward turn,\r\n  dropping below zero for the first time that season; and it did\r\n  not again rise above 6.5° till November 12. This cold spell,\r\n  combined with a snow blizzard from the north on the 6th and 7th,\r\n  coincided at least in part with the large migratory movement\r\n  noted above, and it may have been the stimulus for it.\r\n\r\n  The general weather conditions that obtained from November 12 on\r\n  may be summarized as follows. It was at least predominantly\r\n  cloudy on all but four or five days. There was snowfall on six\r\n  days, and drifting snow in the air on several other days. The\r\n  winds were predominantly north, northwest, and west; less\r\n  commonly, east and southeast. They were a little more frequently\r\n  light than moderate or brisk. The extremes of temperature during\r\n  this period were 22.5° and -23°; the average daily mean,\r\n  approximately 1°. There was an average of probably at least 8\r\n  inches of snow on the ground, with deeper drifts. The river was\r\n  not wholly frozen over at least up to the end of November.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Retrograde autumnal movement_\r\n\r\nIt would doubtless be difficult to find, among other animals, any exact\r\nparallel to this curious feature of caribou migration. According to\r\nCharles Schweder, it takes place in the Nueltin Lake region in\r\nSeptember--sometimes as early as the first of the month. Herds up to 200\r\nstrong may then be seen moving northward, but generally the numbers are\r\nsmaller--say 10 to 30 in a band. Some of the more notable autumnal\r\nmovements toward the north, as reported by Charles, were the following:\r\nat Simons' Lake in 1936 and again in 1938, when herds of fat bucks were\r\nstreaming past for a month and a half; likewise at Josie's Bay in 1940;\r\nand through the Windy Hills and across Windy River in 1943. Fred\r\nSchweder, Jr., said that most of the animals, in returning northward at\r\nthis season, cross Windy River 4 miles above its mouth or Windy Bay 4\r\nmiles from its head; comparatively few pass the mouths of Windy and\r\nLittle rivers. He remarked further that it is mostly bucks, with few\r\ndoes and fawns, that make the passage on Windy Bay.\r\n\r\nMore or less evidence of such a movement toward the north in 1947 has\r\nbeen presented in preceding pages, in the notes for September 6, 7, 11,\r\n14, 20, 24, and 28, October 1, and even October 23. The numbers observed\r\nso involved on each of these days varied from a solitary buck or a doe\r\nwith a fawn to about 300 of the animals. On some of these days, however,\r\nother Caribou were observed making their way toward the south. It is\r\nthus obvious that there was no universal impulse among the Caribou of a\r\ngiven area to move simultaneously in a certain direction.\r\n\r\nThe general weather conditions on the nine above-mentioned days may be\r\nsummarized as follows. Every day but one was largely or wholly cloudy;\r\nsnow falling on three days, but ground bare on other days; wind\r\npredominantly from the north; extreme temperatures, 26° and 61°; mean\r\ndaily average, 37.5°. Whether or not there is significance in the\r\nmatter, it appears that on those days within the period extending from\r\nSeptember 6 to October 1, when the Caribou were not definitely observed\r\nmoving northward, the winds were less likely to be northerly.\r\nFurthermore, within this period there was never enough snow to interfere\r\nappreciably with the animals' feeding on the ground lichens of the\r\nBarrens.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 1.

Chiefly does and fawns, with several bucks bringing up the\r\n    rear. August 26, 1947.]\r\n\r\nBy October 6 there were 6 inches of snow on the ground, and on the\r\nfollowing day 200 Caribou swimming southward across Windy Bay may have\r\nmarked the beginning of the final movement into the timbered country. It\r\nappears possible that a considerable fall of snow may have a definite\r\ninfluence in inducing the Caribou to retreat from the Barrens.\r\n\r\nOn a trip from Windy River north to the Kazan River region in September,\r\n1946, Charles Schweder found, during the first 45 miles, that the\r\nCaribou were moving north; at the Kazan they were moving south, although\r\nsome were merely loitering. Northwest of the Kazan, the animals were\r\ntaking a westward course. During the latter part of his return trip to\r\nWindy River, 11 or 12 days later, they had reversed the previous\r\ndirection and were traveling south.\r\n\r\nFor such a distinct and regular feature in the life cycle of the species\r\nas the retrograde autumnal movement there must be some biological\r\nexplanation. Several possible factors appear reasonably clear. Perhaps\r\nwe may consider the Barren Grounds the true and preferred home of\r\n_Rangifer arcticus_, from which a proportion of the population is driven\r\nduring part of the year under stress of insect attacks or shortage of\r\nfood. When the animals begin to enter the woods in August, there is no\r\nshortage of food; thus an insect-induced frenzy may possibly be regarded\r\nas a potent force driving them southward. In September a state of\r\ncomparative peace descends upon the caribou world: the current crop of\r\nadult insects has subsided; the larvae of warble and nostril flies have\r\nnot attained the formidable size of the following spring and perhaps are\r\nnot yet causing any severe discomfort; little or no snow covers up the\r\nfood supply; the lakes and rivers, still unfrozen, offer a ready way of\r\nescape from pursuing Wolves; moderate or even balmy weather gives nature\r\na pleasant mood. In short, both man and beast may well look upon early\r\nautumn as the very finest time of year both on the Barrens and in the\r\nadjacent wooded country.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances a definite retrograde movement out of the\r\nwooded country in September on the part of many Caribou must indicate\r\ntheir preference for the Barrens at this season. In any event, the\r\nmovement begins just after the insect menace has subsided to a\r\nnegligible stage. Possibly another inducement for retreating from the\r\nwooded country in the early fall is the dearth of open areas in which\r\nthe animals may spend their resting periods, in comparative safety from\r\nWolves. It is only after the freeze-up that the surfaces of the lakes\r\nand rivers supply this desideratum. This condition lasts from November\r\nto June--precisely that part of the year in which the Caribou are\r\npresent in the wooded country in the greatest numbers.\r\n\r\nBut by November what are the conditions on the Barrens? The weather has\r\nbecome severe; snow has covered up a large part of the ground lichens;\r\ntree lichens are not to be had. And so at this season, with the coming\r\nof the first heavy snows, there is a final movement out of the Barrens\r\ninto the shelter of the woods, leaving only a minority of the animals to\r\nface a bleak and bitter winter in the open country. The biggest herds of\r\nthe year may then be seen passing southward. A few bucks are said to\r\nremain during most winters in the Windy River area.\r\n\r\nFar to the westward, toward Great Slave and Great Bear lakes, the\r\nretrograde movements are somewhat different and more complicated\r\n(Clarke, 1940: 96).\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Carl Buchholz, of Churchill, describes the caribou migration at the\r\n60th parallel, north of Churchill, as a southward migration in August,\r\nnorthward in September, and then south in the autumn\" (Clarke, 1940:\r\n97). (See also the next paragraph.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fall migration in the Churchill region_\r\n\r\nThe following notes for 1947 were kindly furnished me by Angus MacIver.\r\nHe reported large numbers of Caribou moving southward across Caribou\r\nCreek (25 miles south of Churchill) about November 10, a day after the\r\nlocal freeze-up. He would then see thousands in a day. Prior to that\r\ntime (perhaps in September?) there had been two \"runs\" to the northward\r\nand northwestward; these presumably represented the normal retrograde\r\nmigration in the fall. The herds engaged in these two northerly\r\nmovements must have previously passed southward farther inland. He\r\nreported also that the rutting season this year had commenced a little\r\nlater than the usual October 15.\r\n\r\n  _References on migration._--Dobbs, 1774: 20, 22; Hearne, 1795:\r\n  39, 40, 56, 66, 74, 85-87, 286, 299; Franklin, 1823: 241-242;\r\n  Sabine, in Franklin, 1823: 667; Richardson, \"1825\": 328-329, and\r\n  1829: 242-243; Godman, 1831, +2+: 283-284; John Ross, 1835a:\r\n  328, 330, 337, 376, 390, 529-530, 628; J. C.

Manitoba: Nueltin (southern\r\npart), Nejanilini, Reindeer, and Split lakes; Seal River; Churchill;\r\nCape Churchill; \"Little Barrens\" south of Churchill; between Churchill\r\nand Knife Lake; Caribou Creek, 25 miles south of Churchill.\r\nSaskatchewan: small lakes southwest of Reindeer Lake; lakes south of\r\nLake Athabaska. Details as to occurrence and status in these localities\r\nare supplied on other pages.\r\n\r\nThe Caribou have been so thoroughly distributed over the approximately\r\n300,000 square miles of the mainland Barren Grounds between Hudson Bay\r\nand the Mackenzie Valley that it is fairly safe to say that there is\r\nscarcely one square mile in this vast territory that has not been trod\r\nby the animals during the past century. See maps by Preble (1908: pl.\r\n19), Seton (1929, +3+: 60), Clarke (1940: figs. 3, 4), Banfield (1949:\r\n479), and Anonymous (1952: 267).\r\n\r\n  The appended annotated bibliography supplies, in abstract form,\r\n  most of the hitherto published information on the geographical\r\n  distribution of _Rangifer arcticus arcticus_. In its preparation\r\n  I have included records of Caribou from the Arctic islands north\r\n  to Lancaster Sound, Barrow Strait, Viscount Melville Sound, and\r\n  McClure Strait--all approximately in latitude 74° N. This has\r\n  been done as a matter of having a convenient, well-defined\r\n  regional boundary, not with any conviction that _arcticus_ has\r\n  ranged so far to the north in the more westerly islands,\r\n  especially in recent years, when it is said to have become\r\n  restricted to the southern fringe of the islands (Clarke, 1940:\r\n  98; R. M. Anderson, 1947: 178; Banfield, 1949: fig. 1). The\r\n  islands north of latitude 74° are doubtless the exclusive domain\r\n  of _Rangifer pearyi_. It is possible that this species may also\r\n  occur to some extent on Banks, Victoria, Prince of Wales, and\r\n  Somerset islands. The typical _R. a. arcticus_, as currently\r\n  recognized, ranges eastward to Baffin, Salisbury, Coats, and\r\n  Southampton islands and to the western shore of Hudson Bay. (The\r\n  animals of the last three islands may be distinct insular\r\n  forms.) The southern limits of the winter range in northwestern\r\n  Ontario, central Manitoba, northern Saskatchewan, and\r\n  northeastern Alberta have been discussed in preceding pages. On\r\n  the west the range extends to the Mackenzie Delta (formerly),\r\n  Great Bear and Great Slave lakes, Wood Buffalo Park, and Lake\r\n  Claire. The timbered country (Hudsonian and Canadian Zones) is\r\n  practically entirely deserted by the Barren Ground Caribou in\r\n  mid-summer. At this season, in Keewatin at least, the animals\r\n  tend to draw away also from the southernmost portions of the\r\n  Barren Grounds.\r\n\r\n  _References._--Since practically every paper in the entire\r\n  bibliography presents some data on geographical distribution,\r\n  only a few, containing more than an average amount of new or\r\n  summarized information on the subject, have been selected for\r\n  inclusion in the following list of references: Hearne, 1795;\r\n  Franklin, 1823; Lyon, 1824; Franklin and Richardson, 1828;\r\n  Simpson, 1843; Pike, 1917 (1892); Russell, 1898; Preble, 1902;\r\n  Hanbury, 1904; Amundsen, 1908; Preble, 1908; R. M.

On the Barren Grounds proper they frequent the open summits\r\nand slopes of the ridges, the dwarf birch thickets, the sedge bogs, and\r\nthe peat bogs. Their trails traverse all the upland spruce and tamarack\r\ntracts, the wooded muskegs, and the willow thickets along the rivers. In\r\nthe summer and fall they swim the rivers and the narrower lakes, and\r\nduring the winter and spring they cross these on the ice. They do not\r\navoid rapids; in fact, they seek the shallower ones as fords, and they\r\nswim the deeper ones (_cf._ Clarke, 1940: 88). They also cross the\r\ntundra ponds on the ice, but probably walk around these smaller bodies\r\nof water, as a rule, when they are not frozen. While they may prefer to\r\napproach the river crossings over open slopes, they do not hesitate to\r\nmaintain trails through the dense thickets of willow on the banks.\r\n\r\nThe winter habitat of the major part of the Barren Ground Caribou\r\npopulation comprises the Hudsonian and upper Canadian Zones. This\r\nforested habitat is characterized by sparser and smaller timber in the\r\nHudsonian Zone and by denser and taller timber in the Canadian Zone.\r\nImportant among the features of this winter habitat are the frozen\r\nsurfaces of the lakes and rivers, where the Caribou are wont to\r\ncongregate for their daily periods of rest (_cf._ Mallet, 1926: 79;\r\nIngstad, 1933: 86).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Trails_\r\n\r\nThe favorite migratory highways are the long, sinuous ridges that\r\nstretch across the Barren Grounds in a sufficiently approximate\r\nnorth-south direction to serve the needs of the Caribou. Here their\r\nage-old trails are particularly in evidence and may even be detected\r\nfrom the air. A single small ridge may bear half a dozen or more such\r\ntrails (fig. 1), roughly parallel but anastomosing at frequent\r\nintervals. They probably change but little from generation to\r\ngeneration. They provide the smoothest courses available, avoiding rocks\r\nand shrubs and traversing intervening bogs at the most suitable points.\r\nThe summits of the ridges constitute vantage points from which the\r\nanimals may keep a wide lookout for Wolves and human enemies, and on\r\nwhich they may obtain the maximum benefit from fly-deterring breezes.\r\nMan himself is glad to utilize these trails, whether on the Barrens or\r\nin the timber tracts, wherever they lead in a direction he desires. They\r\nare kept open by the hurrying feet of hundreds or thousands of Caribou\r\nevery year.\r\n\r\nAlong a well-used trail extending through low Barrens near Duck Bay,\r\nI found a certain grass (_Agrostis scabra_) growing. I did not recognize\r\nor collect it elsewhere during the season. Is this perhaps like certain\r\nother species, such as _Juncus tenuis_ (_fide_ Dr. Edgar T. Wherry) and\r\n_Eleocharis baldwinii_, in curiously thriving on beaten paths?\r\n\r\nWhen the Caribou arrive at some lake or river, they generally follow the\r\nshores for a greater or lesser distance, seeking either a way around or\r\na suitable crossing-place. The trails thus formed are generally on the\r\nnearest ridges rather than on the immediate shores. Their direction, as\r\nthey conform to the winding shores, may diverge very widely from the\r\ndesired migratory course.\r\n\r\nIn many parts of the Barren Grounds there must be as many as 10 linear\r\nmiles of caribou trails to every square mile of territory. Even if there\r\nwere only one mile of such trails to each square mile, the total, on the\r\nBarrens of Keewatin and Mackenzie alone, would equal or exceed all the\r\nrailway mileage in the United States.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the narrow ridges, the broader hilltops in the Barrens\r\noffer such freedom of movement to the Caribou that trails are much less\r\nlikely to be formed in such places, even when they are frequented by\r\nlarge numbers of the animals. Thus I found the broad summit of Josie's\r\nHill practically without well-defined trails, despite the regularity\r\nwith which many migrant bands resort thither. In feeding or traveling\r\nover such an area, there is no occasion for restricting themselves to a\r\nnarrow course. In crossing from one ridge to another through an\r\nintervening bog, the animals may leave numerous scattered and temporary\r\ntrails in the dense sedge growth to mark their passage (fig. 13). On the\r\nuniform surface of such a bog, as on the broad hilltops, there is no\r\nneed to confine their steps to any particular course.\r\n\r\nIt might be supposed that the Barren Ground Caribou would have some\r\nreluctance in entering thickly wooded tracts, where Wolves naturally\r\nhave a much better chance of a close approach than on the open Barrens.\r\nAs already stated, however, their trails may be found more or less\r\nthroughout the spruce and tamarack growth in the Windy River area. One\r\nof these tracts, covering probably several square miles on the west side\r\nof Four-hill Creek, is fairly crisscrossed with trails. At deep dusk on\r\nOctober 2, while several of us were skinning a Black Bear in this thick\r\ntimber, about five does and fawns trotted up quite close to us. Perhaps\r\nthey were on their way to the open Barrens to pass the night. While\r\nwintering in the forested Hudsonian Zone, the animals may spend their\r\nnights as well as their diurnal resting periods on the frozen lakes and\r\nrivers.\r\n\r\nFred Schweder, Jr., says that Caribou are somewhat fearful of sand hills\r\nor eskers, and that he has never seen one lying down in such a place; he\r\nbelieves this is because the Wolves frequent the eskers in summertime.\r\nOn the other hand, Mr. G. W. Malaher spoke of a long esker that extends\r\ndown the west side of Nueltin Lake and far to the southward; this, he\r\nsaid, forms a migration highway for the Caribou.\r\n\r\n  _References on habitats and trails._--J. B.

Anderson, 1947: 178). Peary's\r\nCaribou (_R. pearyi_) inhabits the more northerly Arctic islands\r\nthroughout the year, without engaging in such extensive migrations as\r\nits relative to the south.\r\n\r\nThe forceful winds that blow over the Barren Grounds so much of the time\r\nare of distinct benefit to the Caribou during the summer in abating the\r\nvery serious scourge of flies. If other things were equal (as they are\r\nnot), this factor alone would make the Barrens a more favorable summer\r\nhabitat than the forested country. (See _Retrograde autumnal movement_.)\r\nAir movements of similar strength during the winter must, through the\r\nwind-chill factor (_cf._ Siple and Passel, 1945), make life so much the\r\nharder for any living being; on the other hand, they tend to sweep the\r\nridges bare of snow, thereby making readily available the Caribou's\r\nprincipal winter food of reindeer lichens (_Cladonia_ spp.)\r\n\r\n  _References._--Armstrong, 1857: 479; Critchell-Bullock, 1930:\r\n  192, 194-196; Hoare, 1930: 33; Jacobi, 1931: 193, 195; Clarke,\r\n  1940: 96, 99; Banfield, 1951a: 27-29.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Influence of food supply on distribution_\r\n\r\nThe strong winter winds on the Barrens affect the Caribou in still\r\nanother way. While they pack the snow so firmly that man may dispense\r\nwith snowshoes, this condition naturally increases the difficulty that\r\nthe Caribou experience in pawing through the snow to reach the lichens\r\nthat are covered by it. The limited grazing capacity of such areas as\r\nare laid bare by the wind may force a reduction in the wintering\r\npopulation. Although the snow in the timbered regions to the south\r\ncovers virtually the whole surface of the land, it is evidently less\r\ncompact and so offers more favorable feeding conditions than the areas\r\nof hard-packed snow on the Barrens. (Charles Schweder states that Willow\r\nPtarmigan will fly out of the Barrens to spend the night in tracts of\r\ntimber, where the snow is softer and thus more suitable for the\r\nnocturnal burrows of these birds.)\r\n\r\nAnother apparent inducement for resorting to the tracts of timber in\r\nwinter is the abundance there of tree lichens, such as _Alectoria_ and\r\n_Usnea_ (_cf._ Richardson, 1829: 243; J. B. Tyrrell, 1894: 441; Dix,\r\n1951: 287), upon which the Caribou may feed without regard to snow\r\nconditions. (See also _Retrograde autumnal movement_.)\r\n\r\nReindeer lichens (_Cladonia_ spp.) and doubtless other lichens are of\r\nsuch slow growth that forest fires may deprive the Caribou of this\r\nindispensable food for a period of years. According to Mr. G. W.\r\nMalaher, the recent burning of a large area north of The Pas may have\r\ndeflected the animals toward the southeast, causing them to extend their\r\nmigration to an abnormal distance in that direction. For a similar\r\nreason in years past, according to Pike (1917 [1892]: 50), they avoided\r\n\"great stretches of the country\" near the Mackenzie River, and also on\r\nthe south side of Great Slave Lake. A quarter of a century after Pike's\r\ntime, Dogribs reported that Caribou had not come to the lower Taltson\r\nRiver for several years, \"because the timber had been burned off\"\r\n(Harper, 1932: 30). Some years ago, extensive fires in Manitoba were\r\nsaid to have been deliberately set by prospectors with the aim of\r\nexposing the underlying rock.\r\n\r\nCharles Schweder believes that the Caribou show a certain predilection\r\nfor rocky places, owing to the more luxuriant growth of lichens there.\r\n\r\n  _References._--Richardson, \"1825\": 328-329; Bompas, 1888: 24;\r\n  Pike, 1917 (1892): 50; Wheeler, 1914: 60; Blanchet, 1930: 52;\r\n  Jacobi, 1931: 192, 194, 195; Harper, 1932: 30; Ingstad, 1933:\r\n  34, 161, 163; Hornby, 1934: 105; R. M.

Naturally the season begins\r\nearlier in the more southerly localities. In two seasons (1914, 1920) at\r\nthe western end of Lake Athabaska they began to be troublesome about the\r\nmiddle of June, whereas at Nueltin Lake this stage was reached about the\r\nfirst of July. In the Athabaska and Great Slave lakes region (Canadian\r\nand Hudsonian Zones) I have never had occasion to regard black flies as\r\nserious in respect to either numbers or ferocity; but there is universal\r\nagreement that conditions are vastly different and worse on the Barren\r\nGrounds. At Nueltin Lake the _Simulium_ hordes become troublesome at\r\napproximately the same time as the mosquitoes. Toward the end of August\r\nthere is a merciful diminution in the numbers of both mosquitoes and\r\nblack flies on the Barrens, and after the first of September they may be\r\npractically disregarded, except on an occasional day of unseasonable\r\nwarmth.\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked in passing that one of the insect terrors of the\r\nAthabaska region, the so-called \"bulldog\" (a species of Tabanidae), did\r\nnot come to my attention as a pest at Nueltin Lake though I collected\r\ntwo species of _Tabanus_. Malloch (1919), in reporting on the Diptera of\r\nthe Canadian Arctic Expedition of 1913-18, does not include a single\r\nspecies of Tabanidae. On the other hand, Twinn (1950: 18) states that 17\r\nspecies have been found at Churchill; he refers to tabanids as \"very\r\nabundant in forested regions of the North.\" The \"bulldog\" may be\r\npresumed to contribute to the summer misery of the Woodland Caribou and\r\nthe Moose as well as of man.\r\n\r\nThe season during which the adult warble flies and nostril flies harass\r\nthe Caribou probably lasts only a few weeks in July and August. While\r\nthe adults evidently cause no pain, they no doubt arouse an instinctive\r\ndread in the prospective hosts of their larvae. While I have no\r\ninformation as to whether they follow the hosts into the wooded country,\r\nit would appear quite likely that they do so if we are to credit\r\nstatements by Franklin (1823: 242), Richardson (1829: 251), and B. R.\r\nRoss (1861: 438) that these pests infest the Woodland Caribou as well as\r\nthe Barren Ground species. Furthermore, _Cephenemyia_ has been reported\r\nin Pennsylvania as a parasite of the White-tailed Deer (_Odocoileus_)\r\n(Stewart, 1930?). The scarcity of available study material may be judged\r\nfrom the fact that the Canadian Arctic Expedition of 1913-18 secured\r\nonly three adults of _Oedemagena_ and none of _Cephenemyia_ (Malloch,\r\n1919: 55-56).\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing it may be seen that the wooded country represents a\r\nvirtually fly-free haven for the Barren Ground Caribou during nearly ten\r\nmonths of the year. Is it any wonder, then, that they hasten throughout\r\nAugust toward or into the shelter of the woods, to gain freedom from the\r\nwinged scourges of the Barrens? (See also _Retrograde autumnal\r\nmovement_.)\r\n\r\nIn the spring migration of 1947 the last of the Caribou passed the Windy\r\nRiver area on July 1, just before the mosquitoes and black flies had\r\nbecome seriously troublesome. It might be surmised that the animals keep\r\nmarching northward in advance of the appearance of these flies, as long\r\nas that is feasible; and that when fairly overwhelmed by the winged\r\nhordes, they desist from further progress in that direction. The fawns\r\nare born at such a time (in late May or June) as to pass their first few\r\ntender weeks before becoming subject to serious insect attacks.\r\n\r\n(See also _Retrograde autumnal movement_; _Relations to flies_.)\r\n\r\n  _References._--Richardson, \"1825\": 328-329; Hoare, 1930: 33,\r\n  37-38; Jacobi, 1931: 193-195; Soper, 1936: 429; Hamilton, 1939:\r\n  247, 301; Clarke, 1940: 95-96; Porsild, 1943: 389; Banfield,\r\n  1951a: 27-29.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Effect of combined environmental factors on distribution_\r\n\r\nThe sum total of environmental factors apparently makes the Barren\r\nGrounds a distinctly more favorable summer habitat for the present\r\nspecies than the wooded country, since the latter region is virtually\r\nentirely deserted at that season. In general, the wooded country must be\r\na more favorable winter habitat, since the bulk of the animals evidently\r\nresort to it at that time; yet its advantages are by no means clear-cut\r\nor overwhelming, since a very considerable proportion of the Caribou\r\nelect to spend the winter on the Barrens (Hanbury, 1904: 93, 120, 139;\r\nHoare, 1930: 22; Clarke, 1940: 8-9, 11, fig. 4; Anonymous, 1952: 267).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Relations to man_\r\n\r\nThe Caribou dominates the thoughts, the speech, and the general human\r\nactivities of the Barren Grounds. As the chief food resource of that\r\nregion and the adjacent timbered country, it plays a highly important\r\nrole in the economy of both primitive and civilized man. As long as\r\nthose regions were occupied only by native Eskimos and Indians,\r\nemploying such primitive weapons as bows and spears, the species was in\r\nno danger. Its vast numbers were maintained steadily from generation to\r\ngeneration, and were perhaps limited only by the grazing or browsing\r\ncapacity of their range.\r\n\r\nWith the advent of civilized man and the placing of firearms in the\r\nhands of the natives, the situation has deteriorated at a rate that\r\nbecomes accelerated with the passage of time. If it had not been for the\r\nencroachment of civilization and the introduction of its instruments of\r\ndestruction, the natives would have been assured of a proper meat supply\r\nfor an indefinite period. Here and there some of them would miss a\r\ncaribou migration and starve to death; yet the animals have been so\r\ngenerally available that many of the natives even today lack the\r\nforesight to put up an adequate supply of fish as an alternative winter\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nAlmost everywhere the annual slaughter is both excessive and wasteful.\r\nFew inhabitants of the North, whether native or white, stay their hands\r\nwhile Caribou are present and ammunition is available. There is undue\r\nreliance on a continuation of past abundance, and an indifference to the\r\nwelfare or rights of posterity. The whole culture of the inland Eskimos\r\nand the northern Indians (the Caribou-eater Chipewyans in particular) is\r\nso thoroughly based upon Caribou that the decimation of these animals\r\nwould mean a fundamental modification or virtual extermination of their\r\nculture.\r\n\r\nThe average trapper of the Barren Grounds apparently aims at killing\r\nannually at least 100 Caribou. Only a small portion is required to feed\r\nhimself and his family. The rest is designed for use as fox bait and dog\r\nfeed. In September he goes over his trap-line, perhaps 100 miles long,\r\nand endeavors to kill Caribou at convenient intervals throughout its\r\nlength. (In October, 1944, a single trapper killed 90 during two days of\r\na big movement.) The animals are left where they fall. Presently spells\r\nof warm weather may render the meat unsuitable for any one with more\r\nfastidious tastes than a hardy man of the Barrens. In any event, the\r\nbeasts of the field evidently get the lion's share, even when the\r\ntrapper endeavors to cover the carcasses with rocks or spruces. Bears,\r\nWolves, Foxes, Weasels, Wolverines, Lemmings, Rough-legged Hawks,\r\nRavens, and Canada Jays help themselves to the free feast. Bears in\r\nparticular are likely to consume the whole carcass; in the autumns of\r\n1944 and 1947 they thus disposed of about 70 and 40 caribou bodies,\r\nrespectively, within a few miles of the Windy River post. If the season\r\nturns out to be a particularly poor one for Arctic Foxes, the trapper\r\nmay abandon his trap-line for that winter, and dozens or scores of\r\nCaribou will have been sacrificed in vain.\r\n\r\nFish, which are available in abundance nearly everywhere, would serve\r\nwell enough for both fox bait and dog feed. But the average trapper\r\nprefers to secure Caribou--a less laborious matter than putting up a\r\nwinter's supply of fish; at the same time he may admit that fish are\r\neasier to handle in feeding and are preferable from that point of view.\r\nCharles Schweder has rarely found Caribou along his trap-line between\r\nthe upper Kazan River and Dubawnt Lake. By using fish (out of the Little\r\nDubawnt River) for fox bait, he avoids the necessity of making an early\r\nfall trip over that long distance to secure Caribou for his winter\r\noperations. A trapper from northern Manitoba informed me that the local\r\nIndians were complying with a recent government regulation that each\r\nowner must put up a certain number of fish for the consumption of his\r\ndogs--but, they were still feeding them with Caribou. The Split Lake\r\nband of Indians on the Nelson River, Manitoba, were reported to have\r\nkilled 4,000 of the animals during the winter of 1946-47; the greater\r\npart of these were utilized ingloriously as dog feed.\r\n\r\nThe hunting of such an extraordinarily unwary animal as the Barren\r\nGround Caribou calls for extremely little skill. Scarcely anything more\r\nis required of the hunter (at least in southwestern Keewatin) than to\r\nplace himself on their line of march and to await their arrival. No\r\nconcealment is necessary, but quick movements are to be avoided, and the\r\ndirection of the wind should be such that it will not carry the dread\r\nhuman scent to the animals. Even in perfectly open terrain one may\r\ngenerally walk slowly up to within shooting distance of resting Caribou.\r\nBut if they are on the march and have already gone past, the hunter may\r\nnot succeed in getting close to them. Pursuing them on the run is likely\r\nto send them off in a panic. (There is some evidence that on the Arctic\r\nCoast and in the Barren Grounds of Mackenzie, where hunters are probably\r\nmore numerous than in southwestern Keewatin, the Caribou are usually\r\nmuch more wary--_cf._ Amundsen, 1908, +1+: 103; Stefánsson, 1913b:\r\n278; Blanchet, 1925: 34; Ingstad, 1933: 88.) In the section on\r\n_Disposition_ the destruction of about a quarter of a herd of 100 or\r\nmore by a single hunter is described. On September 9 an Eskimo boy\r\nkilled 13. On November 3 eight out of a herd of 50 were secured by\r\nanother hunter in a few minutes' time. During the autumn migration of\r\n1947 one of the Eskimos on the upper Kazan had killed 85 before the end\r\nof September. This band of Eskimos is said to have once slaughtered 500\r\nanimals, half of them in the river, where they did not even bother to\r\npull them out; they had killed for the sheer delight of killing rather\r\nthan for utilization. It is customary for them to spear more animals\r\nthan they shoot. A trader's family in the Nueltin Lake region used to\r\nkill 500 Caribou per year for their own use and for their 23 dogs. In\r\none instance a number of Caribou were shot from across a river; several\r\nhours elapsed before a canoe became available, and by that time the\r\nbodies were frozen so stiff that no attempt was made to use them. It was\r\nreported that tractor crews operating between Reindeer Lake and Flin\r\nFlon brought out many hind quarters to sell illegally at the latter\r\npoint, leaving other parts of the bodies along the way. In the winter of\r\n1944-45 Nueltin Lake was said to have been covered with the bodies of\r\nCaribou that the Chipewyans had shot for \"fun\" and had neglected to\r\nutilize. It was also reported that in May, 1947, there were many\r\nneglected bodies in the vicinity of Duck Lake, the local Chipewyans\r\nhaving killed the animals during the previous fall; meanwhile the spring\r\nmigration had commenced and was furnishing all the fresh meat required.\r\n\r\nIn the Windy River area nearly all the Caribou were secured with rifles.\r\nA few, however, were speared by the Eskimo boy as they swam across Windy\r\nBay. The spears used here are manufactured articles of iron, fitted to a\r\nwooden shaft.\r\n\r\nKatello, a Kazan River Eskimo, informed Charles Schweder that his people\r\nused to construct snow-covered pits for the Caribou to fall into. The\r\npresent generation is considered too lazy to undertake such a task.\r\nAlthough information is lacking in the present case, urine may have been\r\nemployed to entice the Caribou into these pits, as reported by Hanbury\r\n(1904: 114-115, 123, fig.).\r\n\r\nA general deterioration of antler size in the Barren Ground Caribou\r\nseems to constitute a case parallel with that of the European Red Deer\r\n(_Cervus elaphus elaphus_). The reason is evidently the same in each\r\ncase--the long-continued selection by hunters of old males with the best\r\n\"heads.\" Only the motive differs decidedly in each case: the European\r\nhunter looks upon the antlers themselves as the main prize; the Eskimo\r\nand the Indian are indifferent to these ornaments, but realize that the\r\nbucks with great antlers provide the most meat and _fat_. The bucks are\r\nsaid to become much fatter than the does. The Eskimos are especially\r\nkeen on getting the big bucks. According to Charles Schweder, the old\r\nantlers left at the river crossings from bygone days are superior in\r\nsize to those of the present day. He himself has never secured a set of\r\nantlers equal to one (fig. 25) lying on the shore of Simons' Lake; it\r\nmay have been there for 20 or 30 years prior to 1947.\r\n\r\nFrom about mid-September to nearly mid-October the flesh is counted upon\r\nas being in especially fine condition. In August, 1947, the animals had\r\nscarcely any fat, but by the middle of September the roasts were\r\ndelicious. On October 8 the fresh strips of back fat from several bucks\r\nweighed about 5 to 10 lbs. each. A good many of these strips were put in\r\na storehouse at Windy River for winter use. Charles Schweder remarked on\r\nhaving seen such a piece of fat 3 inches thick. At the rutting season,\r\nwhich commences about mid-October, the bucks become very poor and thin.\r\nThey neglect their feeding and do not have full stomachs, as earlier in\r\nthe season. Their fat becomes tinted with red, and the flesh becomes so\r\nmusky that even the dogs and the Wolves disdain it. (See also the\r\nsection on _Fat_.)\r\n\r\nIn some cases, when a local Caribou is being dressed, a part of the\r\nstomach is utilized as a receptacle into which the blood is dipped from\r\nthe body cavity with the hands, in Eskimo style. The blood goes into the\r\nmaking of soup. The tripe also is relished. Once I found the children of\r\nour camp boiling up a section of the aorta as a delicacy. The ribs are\r\ncommonly impaled on a stick thrust into the ground and roasted in front\r\nof an open fire. Leg bones may be cracked to render the raw marrow\r\naccessible; if they are cooked, the marrow may be blown out of the open\r\nends with the mouth. The Padleimiut consume much of the meat in the raw\r\nstate, and frequently wash it down with hot tea.\r\n\r\nMuch needless wounding and suffering of the Caribou, as well as waste of\r\nvaluable resources, result from extensive use of such a small-calibred\r\nrifle as the .22. It may seem remarkable that such a large animal should\r\nsuccumb at all to such a slight weapon; but it does happen, usually\r\nafter a number of shots. For example, an Eskimo boy secured 13 Caribou\r\nin a single day with a .22. On the other hand, many of the animals must\r\nget away from the hunter, only to die, after much suffering, at a\r\nconsiderable distance, where they are not likely to be recovered and\r\nutilized. The absolute outlawing of the use of the .22 on such large\r\ngame would seem to be in order.\r\n\r\nOnce Charles Schweder shot a doe whose jaw had been broken by a bullet.\r\nA piece of the bone had \"grown into the tongue\" but the jaw was healed.\r\n\r\nAt the Windy River post, in the latter part of summer, portions of the\r\ncaribou bodies are placed in the river not merely for refrigeration, but\r\nfor protection from blowflies. Such meat is used mainly for the dogs.\r\nThe Eskimos are said not to engage in this practice. Consequently, some\r\nof the caribou bodies lying about their camps become masses of maggots.\r\n\r\nOn the last day of September I observed how Charles Schweder prepared a\r\nfresh caribou body in the field and endeavored to protect it from beasts\r\nand birds. First he cut off the head with his hunting-knife; then the\r\nhind legs, which were severed very readily at the hip joint. Next he\r\nopened the body cavity and pulled out the viscera, setting aside a mass\r\nof fat (apparently the omentum). The hind legs were placed beneath the\r\nbody, and the head was thrust into the opening of the abdominal cavity,\r\nas an obstacle to such scavengers as Herring Gulls, Rough-legged Hawks,\r\nCanada Jays, Ravens, and Foxes (_cf._ Downes, 1943: 227, 228). The skin\r\nwas left on the body, and the whole was covered with small spruce tops.\r\n\r\nAn interesting device in the hunting of Caribou consists of \"stone men\"\r\n(Harper, 1949: 231, fig.). They are made of rocks, piled one upon\r\nanother in such a manner as to faintly suggest a human figure. \"Moss\"\r\n(either moss or lichens) is added to some of them to enhance the\r\nhuman appearance. A considerable number may be seen in the Windy River\r\narea, where they are generally placed along the summits of the ridges.\r\nConstruction was probably begun many years ago by natives, and has been\r\ncontinued by the present residents. When Caribou, in fleeing from a\r\nhunter, catch sight of these \"stone men,\" they are likely to pause in\r\nsuspicion of the figures, and to be deflected from their chosen course.\r\nThis may give the hunter a chance to come within range of the animals.\r\nThe Kazan River Eskimos are said to use converging lines of such rock\r\npiles to direct migrating Caribou to certain river-crossings, where the\r\nhunters lie in wait for them. Occasionally a single pile is erected\r\nmerely to mark the spot where a caribou body is left until the hunter\r\ncan return with a dogteam to fetch the meat.\r\n\r\n  [Transcriber's Note: \"... stone men\": Inuksuit (sing. inuksuk).]\r\n\r\nOn first securing one of the animals, the hunter makes a practice of\r\ncutting out the tongue and carrying it to camp in a pocket or a\r\ngame-bag. On a subsequent trip, if there is sufficient snow on the\r\nground, the meat is generally transported by dog sleigh or toboggan\r\n(_cf._ Harper, 1949: 231, fig.). Occasionally a hunter will carry it on\r\nhis shoulder (fig. 4) or in a pack.\r\n\r\nIn all the Canadian North, as far as I am aware, the Windy River post is\r\nvirtually the only place where summer transportation is accomplished by\r\ndog-drawn travois (fig. 5). This device, consisting of two trailing\r\npoles, with a small platform midway, is recognizable immediately by\r\nreaders of Parkman's _Oregon Trail_ (1849), where its use by Indians of\r\nour Western Plains is mentioned again and again. The travois was\r\nintroduced into this region by the late Charles Planchek?, a Czech?\r\ntrapper of somewhat sinister repute, whose headquarters were at Putahow\r\nLake. He was the \"Eskimo Charlie\" of Downes (1943: 160-161, pl.). In\r\nyears gone by he took a travois with him on a visit to the Windy River\r\narea, and it was thereupon copied and subsequently used regularly by the\r\nSchweder family. Their Eskimo friends of the upper Kazan will\r\noccasionally borrow one, but I am not aware that they have made any\r\ntravois of their own. During the summer the two younger boys of the\r\nWindy River post made a practice of hauling in caribou meat from the\r\nsurrounding Barrens by means of travois.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of summer some small pieces of caribou meat were\r\noccasionally laid on a stone for drying, in front of the door at the\r\npost. Other pieces were said to have been hung up in the air for the\r\nsame purpose, without fire or smoke, out in the field where the animals\r\nwere killed. Apparently blowflies did not pay much attention to this\r\nmeat. No considerable quantity seemed to be preserved locally in this\r\nway. Three Caribou-eater Chipewyans from the south end of Nueltin Lake,\r\nwho visited our camp in late October, were carrying dried meat with them\r\nas travel rations and eating it without cooking.\r\n\r\nThe larvae of the warble fly (_Oedemagena tarandi_), found beneath the\r\nskin of the Caribou, are relished by the Eskimos, being eaten apparently\r\nwhile alive and raw. The Eskimo boy of our camp continued this practice\r\nafter his little sister had given it up. Hearne (1795: 197) reported the\r\nIndians as eating the warbles in his day.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 9.

Hide of a Caribou doe, about four years\r\n    old, with about 130 small warbles or warble scars (concentrated on\r\n    the rump). Windy River, September 15, 1947.]\r\n\r\nOnly a small proportion of the hides of the locally killed Caribou are\r\npreserved. A hide that would fetch only a dollar at Reindeer Lake would\r\nnot be worth transporting more than 250 miles from Nueltin Lake. Hearne\r\nlong ago (1795: 84) remarked on the remoteness of the hunting grounds\r\nfrom the trading posts as a barrier to trade in the skins; and this\r\ncondition prevails to a large extent to the present day. Thus only such\r\nhides as are required for domestic use are kept. Tanning, while done by\r\nthe Eskimos of the upper Kazan, is not undertaken by the residents on\r\nWindy River. Here the task of drying the hides is left mainly to the\r\nchildren of the camp. Most of them are pegged out on the summit of a\r\ngravelly ridge, wooden pegs being driven with a rock through slits in\r\nthe edges of the skin (fig. 6). Now and then one is nailed to the outer\r\nwall of a log cabin (fig. 18).\r\n\r\nOne of the main uses of the hides is for winter clothing. The Windy\r\nRiver residents have their garments made by Eskimo women of the upper\r\nKazan, whose tanning process leaves the fur intact. Early autumn hides,\r\nwith new, comparatively short fur, are the ones in demand. The season\r\nfor securing such hides is said to extend to mid-September. At that\r\nseason the larvae of the warble fly have not developed far enough to\r\nhave injured the hide appreciably. The long winter fur is much less\r\nsuitable for clothing. In moderately cold weather a single coat\r\n(_attigi_), with the fur inside (fig. 16), is worn by the Eskimos. This\r\ncoat, when made for a man, extends very little farther downward at the\r\nrear than at the front; but a woman's coat is considerably longer at the\r\nrear. The bottom is generally provided with a fringe consisting of small\r\nstrips of caribou skin, perhaps 4 inches long and 1/16 inch wide. In\r\nmid-winter another coat, with the fur outside (fig. 15), is slipped on\r\nover the other. Both are provided with hoods. Trousers, with the fur\r\noutside, are cut rather short at the bottom; some such material as rope\r\nis passed around the waist, without belt loops, to hold the trousers up.\r\nBoots (_komik_) of tanned caribou skin (fig. 16), reaching nearly to the\r\nknees, with the fur inside, make exceptionally warm footgear in winter.\r\nAn extra piece is sewed on the sole, with the fur outside, but the hairs\r\nsoon wear off. The seams are sewed with sinew. Another sort of boot, for\r\nsummer use, is made of untanned skin, without the fur, and is more or\r\nless waterproof. Mittens (_pahloot_) have the fur outside; the thumb\r\npiece, of a length suitable for a short Eskimo thumb, does not properly\r\nfit a white man.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1947 the migrating Caribou did not reach the territory\r\nof the Chipewyans about the south end of Nueltin Lake till about\r\nNovember 1--by which time the fur had grown so long that it was not\r\nsuitable for clothing. When I inquired of Charles Schweder how these\r\nnatives managed under such circumstances, he replied that nowadays they\r\nuse very little skin clothing--just manufactured clothing. Certainly the\r\nlatter type was being worn by three men of this tribe that visited the\r\nWindy River post in late October. In this connection it is interesting\r\nto note that in November Charles brought to Windy River a bundle of fawn\r\nskins that he had secured from an Eskimo on the upper Kazan. Presently\r\nhe traded them to a Cree halfbreed from the Putahow River, who was to\r\nhave them made into a coat for himself. In years gone by the\r\nabove-mentioned Chipewyans must have found some means of securing\r\ncaribou skins for themselves in August or September; they could have\r\naccomplished this by moving to the northern part of Nueltin Lake,\r\nprovided the animals had not reached the southern part at the proper\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nFrom Charles Schweder I learned that the Hudson's Bay Company acquires\r\ncaribou skins (apparently tanned) from the Duck Lake Chipewyans at about\r\na dollar apiece, puts them up in bales of perhaps 10 to 20 skins, and\r\nships them by steamer from Churchill to Baffin Island or thereabouts,\r\nfor use by the Eskimos. He had seen about 25 or 30 such bales being\r\nloaded on a steamer in September, 1947. This trade evidently results\r\nfrom the present scarcity of Caribou on Baffin Island (_cf._ Manning,\r\n1943a: 47-50; Soper, 1944: 247-250; Banfield, 1949: 481). Moccasins of\r\ncaribou skin, made by the Duck Lake Chipewyans, were on sale at\r\nChurchill.\r\n\r\nThe three Caribou-eater Chipewyans from the south end of Nueltin Lake\r\nbrought mittens, gloves, and moccasins of caribou skin to trade at Windy\r\nRiver. Similar gloves were brought by a Cree halfbreed from the Putahow\r\nRiver.\r\n\r\nAt the Windy River post furred caribou skins served in upholstering the\r\nseat, back, and arms of a couple of home-made chairs. They were used\r\nalso as mattresses or blankets, in the making of sleeping bags, and even\r\nas insulating material on the outside of the cabin (Harper, 1949: 226,\r\n228, figs.). The Schweder boys also maintain tents of caribou skin at\r\nvarious points on their long trap-lines; they are much warmer than\r\ncanvas tents, and require no outlay of cash. The skins are nailed on\r\npoles arranged in tepee form; the height of such a tent is about 10\r\nfeet, and the diameter 9 or 10 feet. There is a home-made stove inside,\r\nwith the smoke-pipe projecting outside about halfway to the top of the\r\ntent.\r\n\r\nThe Eskimos of the Kazan River have large summer tents of caribou skin,\r\nand smaller ones of canvas. The former are the ones in which the drum\r\ndances are held. These Eskimos never make their winter houses wholly of\r\nsnow, according to Charles Schweder, but use caribou skins for the roof.\r\n\r\nIn illustration of the primary importance of the Caribou to both\r\nprimitive and civilized man in the Arctic and the sub-Arctic, the\r\nnumerous cases of partial or complete starvation in the absence of\r\nCaribou may be cited. The chronicles of northern explorers are replete\r\nwith them. A notable case is that of John Hornby and his two companions\r\non the Thelon River in the winter of 1926-27 (Hoare, 1930: 25;\r\nChristian, 1937). In the autumn of 1946 only a small fraction of the\r\nnormal caribou migration passed by the Eskimo camps on the upper Kazan\r\nRiver. These happy-go-lucky, utterly improvident people did not take\r\nsteps to secure an alternative winter's supply of fish, and by the\r\nfollowing spring eight out of the band of 27 persons had succumbed\r\ndirectly or indirectly to starvation. (It is suspected that several were\r\naccounted for by anthropophagy.) Women, children, and dogs were the\r\nvictims; no adult male succumbed. The casualties would doubtless have\r\nbeen more numerous if Charles Schweder had not reported the plight of\r\nthe band when he made a trip to Reindeer Lake in March. Thereupon the\r\ngovernment shipped emergency rations by plane as far as Nueltin Lake,\r\nand Charles transported them from that point by sleigh to the Kazan.\r\nMeanwhile he rescued two of the orphan children, took them to the Windy\r\nRiver post, and in a few more months formally adopted them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ethnological material from caribou products_\r\n\r\nIn addition to the utilization of caribou products for the primary\r\npurposes of food, clothing, and shelter, as discussed in preceding\r\npages, certain other uses of an ethnological nature may be mentioned\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nCharles Schweder spoke of the former Eskimo use of splint bones from the\r\nlegs of Caribou as needles, after a hole had been drilled or burned\r\nthrough the larger end. They are about the same length as a large\r\ndarning needle. These people commonly use the back sinew as thread or as\r\nwrapping on tools, drums, and the like. I saw a piece of back sinew\r\nbeing dried for future use at the Windy River post.\r\n\r\nEither lard or caribou fat serves as fuel for an \"Eskimo candle\"; the\r\nwick is a bit of rag or moss. The heat of the flame melts the fat where\r\nit is spread out in some small receptacle like a can cover. When our\r\nother means of illumination gave out at the Windy River post, I worked\r\nor wrote notes for many hours by the light of one of these candles. It\r\ngives approximately as much illumination as an ordinary tallow candle.\r\nOne disadvantage of using caribou fat for this purpose is the\r\nconsiderable amount of smoke that it produces.\r\n\r\nThe Eskimos make odd use of an antler as a brake for a sleigh, to\r\nprevent the harnessed dogs from running after any Caribou they may\r\nsight; on other occasions it retards the sleigh in descending a hill.\r\nSuch an antler, that I found at the Windy River post, is notched near\r\nthe base; a rope or thong, 2 or 3 feet in length, is fastened at one end\r\nto this notch, and at the other to the side of the sleigh. To apply the\r\nbrake, the driver simply presses down the points of the antler into the\r\nsnow or ice.\r\n\r\nThe drums used in the ceremonial dances of the Kazan River Eskimos are\r\nmade of a piece of caribou skin stretched tightly over a circular frame\r\nof spruce and fastened in place with caribou sinew. They are about 3\r\nfeet in diameter.\r\n\r\nIn an Eskimo fish spear from the upper Kazan River an iron barb on one\r\nof the prongs is supported by a small piece of caribou antler and\r\nfastened with back sinew. The two large lateral prongs, of metal, are\r\ntied to the wooden shaft of the spear with braided sinew.\r\n\r\nTwo snow-knives have handles of antler, about 10 and 11 inches in\r\nlength. One of the handles has been planed down, and is wrapped with\r\nsinew.\r\n\r\nThe handle of another implement, used in cleaning out grains of wood\r\nfrom a hole being drilled in wood, is also a piece of antler.\r\n\r\nA woman's knife, or _ooloo_, has a section of antler for a handle.\r\n\r\nStrands of beads, used either for an ear pendant or for ornaments at the\r\npeak of a hood, have a caribou incisor fastened at the tip. The opposite\r\nend of the pendant is provided with a thin strip of caribou hide for\r\nfastening to a perforated ear lobe.\r\n\r\nThe willow stems of pipes are wrapped with back sinew.\r\n\r\nAntler and sinew went into the making (by Anoteelik) of a \"ring and pin\"\r\ngame.\r\n\r\n  _References on relations to Eskimos and Indians._--Isham, 1949\r\n  (1743): 152-154; Dobbs, 1744: 19; Hearne, 1795: 35, 78, 80-84,\r\n  96, 119, 195-197, 297, 316-319, 321-325; Franklin, 1823:\r\n  243-244; Lyon, 1824: 119, 123, 130, 144, 198, 229, 238, 241,\r\n  282, 311-317, 324, 327, 336; Parry, 1824: 289, 380, 403,\r\n  494-497, 505, 508, 512, 537; Richardson, \"1825\": 330, 331;\r\n  Franklin and Richardson, 1828: 200, 275; Richardson, 1829:\r\n  242-244, 245-249; John Ross, 1835a: 243-244, 252, 352, 512,\r\n  537; J. C.

Since they do not normally venture to an\r\nappreciable distance into the Barren Grounds, their contacts with\r\nCaribou are mainly in the forested zone. For an untold period in the\r\npast there has been a very interesting tripartite relationship between\r\nBears, Caribou, and Caribou-eater Chipewyans about the south end of\r\nNueltin Lake. For information concerning it I am indebted to Charles\r\nSchweder. The Indians of that area have been in the habit of killing\r\nlarge numbers of Caribou, especially on the spring and fall migrations,\r\nand leaving many of the bodies, or parts of the bodies, out in the\r\n\"bush.\" The Bears have become accustomed to taking advantage of the\r\nsituation, especially, perhaps, in the matter of fattening up for\r\nhibernation. This probably resulted in a certain concentration of the\r\nanimals thereabouts. But of late years the local native population has\r\nseriously declined by reason of fatal illness and removal to other\r\nparts. Consequently, as Charles Schweder expressed it, there are no\r\nlonger enough people there to feed the Bears! Three of the Chipewyans\r\nreported in late October, 1947, that they had lost a good many of their\r\nCaribou to the Bears during that season.\r\n\r\nThis recent change in the food situation about the south end of Nueltin\r\nLake has apparently resulted in, or at least coincided with, an influx\r\nof Bears in the Windy River area, where they were unknown until 1944.\r\nDuring the next four years seven Bears were killed locally. The animals\r\nare said to have consumed about 70 Caribou bodies in the fall of 1944,\r\nand about 40 in the fall of 1947 within a few miles of the Windy River\r\npost; thus they became a somewhat serious factor in the human economy of\r\nthe area. The Caribou is evidently the chief loser in this curious\r\nrelationship, but even the Bear, which may be regarded as the chief\r\nbeneficiary, suffers from man's retaliatory efforts.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Relations to foxes_\r\n\r\nThe demand for Arctic Fox furs on the part of the fashionable women of\r\nthe world sends the trapper on his winter rounds over the bleak and\r\nbitter Barren Grounds, where he depends upon his autumn kill of Caribou\r\nfor sustenance for himself and his dogs as well as for fox bait. It is\r\nthus quite obvious where a large share of the responsibility for the\r\ndwindling numbers of the Caribou lies.\r\n\r\nBoth Arctic and Red Foxes (_Alopex lagopus innuitus_ and _Vulpes fulva_\r\nsubsp.) are among the scavengers that help to consume caribou bodies\r\nthat are left unguarded in the wilds. According to Charles Schweder,\r\nfoxes of both species seem to follow the Wolves, presumably in the hope\r\nof securing the leavings of their kills.\r\n\r\nCharles also gave me an account of a remarkable sort of play between a\r\nRed Fox and a small buck Caribou. He had witnessed it in September,\r\n1943, about 18 miles north of Windy River, from a distance of half a\r\nmile. The Fox would approach the Caribou closely; the latter would then\r\nwalk up to the Fox, which would retreat, not allowing the Caribou to\r\ncome close enough to touch it. Neither animal was afraid of the other.\r\nThey kept up this performance for about 5 minutes. The Fox then went\r\namong some bushes, where the Caribou tried to follow it. The larger\r\nanimal was still there, feeding, when Charles passed on out of sight. He\r\nregarded the whole performance as a matter of playfulness. His recital\r\nput me in mind at once of a slightly similar play between a Newfoundland\r\nCaribou and a Red Fox, as recorded by Millais (1907: 302-303).\r\nStefánsson (1921: 623-624) describes a game of tag between an Arctic Fox\r\nand several yearlings of _Rangifer pearyi_ on Melville Island.\r\n\r\n  _References._--Blanchet, 1925: 34; Birket-Smith, 1929(1): 101;\r\n  Critchell-Bullock, 1930: 143; Munn, 1932: 278; Ingstad, 1933:\r\n  90, 157-159; Freuchen, 1935: 128; Banfield, 1951a: 36.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Relations to Wolves_\r\n\r\nAside from man, the principal predatory enemy of the Barren Ground\r\nCaribou is undoubtedly the Wolf. A comparison of a distributional map of\r\nCaribou by Banfield (1949: 479, fig. 1) with a distributional map of\r\nWolves by Goldman (1944: 414, fig. 14) indicates that the latter species\r\nis a considerably more plastic animal. No less than six subspecies of\r\nWolves seem to occur in parts of the currently recognized range of a\r\nsingle subspecies of Caribou (_Rangifer arcticus arcticus_), as follows:\r\n_Canis lupus arctos_, Prince of Wales and Somerset islands; _Canis lupus\r\nmanningi_, Baffin Island; _Canis lupus bernardi_, Victoria Island;\r\n_Canis lupus hudsonicus_, Keewatin, eastern Mackenzie, northern\r\nManitoba, and northeastern Saskatchewan; _Canis lupus mackenzii_,\r\nnorthern Mackenzie; _Canis lupus occidentalis_, southern Mackenzie and\r\nnorthern Alberta and Saskatchewan.\r\n\r\nThe Keewatin Tundra Wolf (_C. l. hudsonicus_) is presumably the only one\r\nthat concerns us here. However, its extension into the forested zone of\r\nnorthern Manitoba and northeastern Saskatchewan, as indicated on\r\nGoldman's map, is still problematical. Goldman's text (1944: 428-429) is\r\nquite indefinite on this point. There are such distinct differences\r\nbetween the general fauna of the Arctic Zone and that of the Hudsonian\r\nZone that the Wolf of the latter zone may well prove to be\r\ndifferentiable from _hudsonicus_, whose type locality is at Schultz Lake\r\nin west central Keewatin. It is an interesting question whether any\r\nWolves of the Barren Grounds follow the Caribou southward into the\r\ntimbered country in the fall; likewise, whether any individual Wolves of\r\nthe latter region accompany the Caribou on their spring migration out\r\ninto the Barrens. Little light on the subject seems available at\r\npresent. There is no doubt, however, that a good many Wolves remain\r\nduring the winter on parts of the Barren Grounds that have been deserted\r\nby the Caribou at that season. Furthermore, at the time of the spring\r\nmigration, mature Wolves of the forest zone would be restricted to their\r\nhome territory by the necessity of caring for their young ones.\r\n\r\nA Wolf is by no means able to capture a Caribou at will. During the\r\nseason of open water the latter may effect a ready escape by plunging\r\ninto the nearest river or lake and crossing to the other side. There is\r\nreason to believe that islands provide a good sanctuary during the\r\nsummer (Seton, 1929, +3+: 108-109; Gavin, 1945: 228). In the winter the\r\nCaribou must depend primarily on its fleetness of foot. Even the fawns\r\nare reputed to be able to outdistance Wolves in a chase that is not too\r\nprolonged. An adult, if brought to bay after a long chase, is probably\r\nable to stand off a single Wolf indefinitely. Its powerful hoofs are its\r\nprincipal means of defense. Even if the antlers are brought into play,\r\nthey are effective only during the limited period when they are\r\nfullgrown, hard, and free of velvet. When two or more Wolves manage to\r\nbring a Caribou to bay, the outcome is probably almost invariably in\r\ntheir favor. Charles Schweder has never known a Caribou to kill one of\r\nthese predators in defending itself. In several cases reported by Fred\r\nSchweder, Jr., the last stand was made on the ice of lakes. The Caribou\r\nitself may choose such a place, as if aware that it may be more\r\nsure-footed on the ice than its enemy.\r\n\r\nAfter listening to wolf tales by residents of the frontier settlements\r\nrather than by real men of the \"bush,\" one might almost expect to see a\r\ncouple of these bloodthirsty animals harrying the rear of every band of\r\nCaribou and keeping up a relentless pursuit. However, during a sojourn\r\nof six months on one of the best Caribou ranges in Keewatin, where\r\ntrapping has very little effect on Wolves, I saw just one of these\r\nanimals alive, heard the howling on several occasions, and noted a\r\nsingle Caribou that had probably been killed by them. It is far from a\r\ncommon experience for the resident trappers to witness actual pursuit by\r\nWolves or even to find their kills. The following instances, related by\r\nFred Schweder, Jr., comprised his only direct observations on Wolves in\r\npursuit of Caribou up to and including 1947, when he was eighteen years\r\nold.\r\n\r\nDuring the northward migration in May, 1945, a silent black Wolf pursued\r\na band of 100 Caribou over the ice of Windy Bay. At one time it came\r\nwithin 100 feet, but thereafter they forged ahead. After half a mile the\r\nband split up, and the Wolf desisted. In October, 1946, Fred noticed a\r\nCaribou fighting off two Wolves on the ice of Nueltin Lake near its\r\noutlet. It used both horns and hoofs against its attackers. While one\r\nWolf was in front, the other would try to get in the rear of the Caribou\r\nand hamstring it. This went on for two hours until darkness hid the\r\nscene. The next morning the Caribou was dead and half eaten. On October\r\n16, 1947, a white Wolf was seen in pursuit of four fast-moving Caribou\r\nnear Simons' Lake. It was about half a mile in their rear, and presently\r\nhalted, probably by reason of catching sight of Fred.\r\n\r\nNovember 7, 1947, was a blizzardy day; the air was full of drifting\r\nsnow. Under these conditions a gray Wolf chased a buck and a doe right\r\ninto the dooryard of one of Fred's trapping camps 10 miles north of\r\nWindy River. It was only about 30 feet behind them. When the buck broke\r\nthrough the ice of a little creek, the Wolf went right past it in\r\npursuit of the doe. The latter nearly ran into Fred's toboggan, and he\r\nshot it at a distance of 20 feet. The Wolf came within 40 feet, but by\r\nthe time it was recognized as not just another Caribou, it was 100 feet\r\naway. Fred then shot but merely wounded it, the sight being off his\r\nrifle. Meanwhile the buck escaped, but 3 miles away Fred met with it\r\nagain and secured it. He recognized it as the same animal because at\r\nboth encounters it was limping from a previous wound and was hornless as\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nIn late November Fred found two fullgrown bucks and a doe on the ice of\r\nWindy Lake, where they had been killed by Wolves. The bucks were\r\nantlered and had probably met their end several weeks previously. Yet\r\ntheir flesh was so musky and unpalatable, in consequence of the rutting\r\nseason, that it had not been devoured. A long trail of blood and hair\r\nled to the spot where the doe had fallen, apparently a couple of weeks\r\npreviously; it was still only half eaten.\r\n\r\nIn Fred's opinion, Caribou are apprehensive of sandy eskers as the haunt\r\nof Wolves, and do not linger there.\r\n\r\nOn October 15 Charles Schweder pointed out the body of a Caribou in a\r\nlittle pond in the delta area at the head of Simons' Lake. He considered\r\nit killed by Wolves some weeks previously; its antlers were in the\r\nvelvet, and it had been eaten only about the head and hind quarters as\r\nit lay in the water.\r\n\r\nJoe Chambers, a trapper of Goose Creek (south of Churchill), stated that\r\nWolves select the fattest Caribou, and that during the winter of 1946-47\r\nthey had been devouring only such choice parts as the tongue and the\r\nunborn young.\r\n\r\nCaribou bodies are the primary bait for Wolves and Foxes on the Barren\r\nGrounds. Two traps are commonly placed at each carcass.\r\n\r\nUp to a couple of centuries ago, when the baneful effect of civilized\r\nman began to be felt, the Caribou throve and multiplied to a point where\r\nthey probably strained the grazing capacity of the Barren Grounds.\r\nNeither primitive man nor the Wolf had any serious effect on the size or\r\ncondition of the herds. The Caribou were numbered by millions, and they\r\ndoubtless owed their vigor and their success as a species in no small\r\nmeasure to their friendly enemy, the Wolf. Through long ages the latter\r\nhad tended to eliminate the weaklings, the sickly, and the less alert\r\nindividuals, leaving the fitter animals to propagate their kind. Here\r\nwas a fine example of natural selection operating to the advantage of\r\nthe Caribou. Thus the Wolf may be safely considered a benefactor of the\r\nspecies as a whole--a regulator and protector of its vitality.\r\n\r\nThere are only two regions of the world where Caribou (or Reindeer) have\r\nnot long shared their territory with the Wolf--Spitsbergen and the Queen\r\nCharlotte Islands. And what sort of situation do we find there? Instead\r\nof thriving in the absence of such a natural predator, the animals of\r\nboth regions are the runts of the whole Caribou-Reindeer tribe, and\r\nthose of the Queen Charlottes have become virtually or wholly extinct\r\n(_cf._ Banfield, 1949: 481-482). Furthermore, the Newfoundland Caribou\r\nsuffered a very serious decline after the Newfoundland Wolf became\r\nextinct at about the beginning of the present century. The lesson is\r\nobvious: it is folly for man to imagine that he can benefit the Caribou\r\nby eliminating the Wolves.\r\n\r\nIt is virtually axiomatic that no predatory species (other than modern\r\nman) exterminates its own food supply. Long ago nature must have\r\nestablished a fairly definite ratio between the populations of the Wolf\r\nand the Caribou. Although a certain fluctuation of that ratio could be\r\nexpected from time to time, each fluctuation would be followed by a\r\nreturn to more or less normal conditions. The trend of evolution has\r\ndoubtless been toward perfecting the Wolf in its ability to capture the\r\nCaribou, but at the same time toward perfecting the Caribou in its\r\nability to escape the Wolf. Unequal progress of this sort on the part of\r\nthe two species would presumably have been rather disastrous to the one\r\nor the other. But it is nature's way to have preserved a proper balance\r\nbetween the abilities of the two species, and thus between their\r\npopulations. This balance (a rather delicate one) has probably been\r\nupset to some extent by the advent of civilized man with his devices to\r\nthe Barren Grounds.\r\n\r\nThe Caribou \"exemplify the survival of the fittest; none but the perfect\r\nare allowed to live and breed, hence their perfection. We believe that\r\nthe wolf is in no small degree responsible for this high standard,\r\nand that were he killed off the species as a whole would suffer.\"\r\n(Critchell-Bullock, 1930: 161.)\r\n\r\n\"It is doubtful if the efforts of white or native hunters are of any\r\nimportance whatever in the control of wolves in the caribou country, or\r\ncould, under present circumstances ever be of any importance.\" (Clarke,\r\n1940: 109).\r\n\r\n  _References._--Franklin, 1823: 242, 327, 344, 486, 487; John\r\n  Ross, 1835a: 402, 530, 534, 564; Back, 1836: 128-129; Simpson,\r\n  1843: 232; Armstrong, 1857: 395, 480-481, 488, 525; Osborn,\r\n  1865: 227-228, 231, 232; Kumlien, 1879: 53, 54; Gilder, 1881:\r\n  61; Bompas, 1888: 60; Collinson, 1889: 244; Pike, 1917 (1892):\r\n  56-58; Whitney, 1896: 239; Jones, 1899: 374-375; Preble, 1902:\r\n  41, and 1908: 214; Hanbury, 1904: 89; MacFarlane, 1905: 692-693;\r\n  Amundsen, 1908, +1+: 102; Seton, 1911: 225-226; R. M.

The principal avian scavengers in the Windy River area seem\r\nto be the Rough-legged Hawk (_Buteo lagopus sancti-johannis_), the\r\nHerring Gull (_Larus argentatus smithsonianus_), the Canada Jay\r\n(_Perisoreus canadensis canadensis_), and the Raven (_Corvus corax\r\nprincipalis_). These birds are evidently attracted to the vicinity of\r\ncamps and trap-lines by reason of the numbers of caribou bodies lying\r\nabout. On their first arrival in late May or early June, before the\r\nlakes have opened up and while food in general is scarce, Herring Gulls\r\nseem particularly prone to assemble where Caribou have been recently\r\nkilled. For example, up to June 3 only a handful of these birds had been\r\nseen about Windy River. On that day several Caribou were killed, and on\r\nJune 4 about 100 Herring Gulls had gathered at the scene. Their\r\nscavenger activities make it especially necessary to protect the caribou\r\nbodies in the way described in the section on _Relations to man_. In a\r\nfew days one of the bodies (apparently not so protected) had been almost\r\nentirely consumed. The Herring Gulls operate locally only from May to\r\nSeptember, being absent during the rest of the year. A few Ring-billed\r\nGulls (_Larus delawarensis_) appeared meanwhile and attacked a caribou\r\ncarcass.\r\n\r\nThe Rough-legged Hawk is far less numerous than the Herring Gull and so\r\nis a much less serious scavenger. Now and then, however, it may be noted\r\nfeeding on a caribou carcass. Even the Long-tailed Jaeger (_Stercorarius\r\nlongicaudus_) is reported in such a role. The Canada Jay and the Raven\r\nare permanent residents and are undoubtedly helped through the\r\ninhospitable winter by man-killed Caribou. On the other hand, a good\r\nmany Ravens fall victims to the fox traps placed about the bodies.\r\nCharles Schweder has frequently seen Ravens following Wolves, as if in\r\nexpectation of a kill. Buchanan remarks (1920: 248) concerning the\r\nReindeer Lake region, that the Ravens \"appear to remain in the vicinity\r\nof the Caribou herds all th[r]ough winter.\" In the Windy River area the\r\nCanada Jay became noticeably more numerous in August, after the Caribou\r\nhad returned from the north. The Ravens and the Rough-legs exhibited a\r\nsimilar increase in September and October.\r\n\r\nThe depredations of these carnivorous birds result to the detriment of\r\nthe living Caribou in that they virtually force the hunters and trappers\r\nto kill a larger number of the animals than would otherwise be\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n  _References._--Hanbury, 1904: 135; Stefánsson, 1913a: 93;\r\n  Seton, 1929, +3+: 108; Ingstad, 1933: 157-159; Downes, 1943:\r\n  228; Banfield, 1951a: 36, 42; Harper, 1953: 28, 60, 62-64, 72,\r\n  74, 76.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Relations to miscellaneous animals_\r\n\r\nThe Schweder boys spoke of Arctic Hares (_Lepus arcticus andersoni_)\r\nbeing in the habit of eating the stomach contents of Caribou after the\r\nanimals have been dressed in the field. This represents merely harmless\r\nutilization of a normally waste product, although it serves some of the\r\nnatives as _nerrooks_ or \"Eskimo salad\" (_cf._ Richardson, 1829: 245).\r\nWolverines, Mink, Weasels, and Lemmings help to consume unprotected\r\ncaribou bodies. (In the Old World the Wolverine is regarded as a serious\r\nenemy of live Reindeer [Jacobi, 1931: 243; Harper, 1945: 473].)\r\n\r\n  _References._--Pike, 1917 (1892): 56-58; Seton, 1911: 252, 1929,\r\n  +2+: 413, 424, 443, and 1929, +3+: 108; Harper, 1932: 23;\r\n  Ingstad, 1933: 157-159; Freuchen, 1935: 93, 99; Hoffman, 1949:\r\n  12; Banfield, 1951a: 36, 41; Harper, 1953: 40, 41.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Relations to flies_\r\n\r\nFlies of various kinds perhaps cause more wide-spread, year-round misery\r\nto the Caribou than all other pests and enemies combined. It is safe to\r\nsay that not a single individual in the whole population escapes their\r\nattacks, and some even succumb to mosquitoes (Gavin, 1945: 228). The\r\nvarious biting and parasitic flies have already been discussed to some\r\nextent in the section on _Influence of insects on distribution_.\r\nHarassment by these pests is believed to be the leading cause of the\r\nhaste with which the Caribou are frequently seen passing over the\r\nBarrens in summer. Downes (1943: 204) has commented on the habit of\r\nChipewyan hunters in the Nueltin Lake region of examining the legs of\r\nCaribou for swellings caused by mosquito bites. In a buck secured on\r\nAugust 17 the legs exhibited numerous little bumps of this sort;\r\nfurthermore, black flies covered the buck's body, while scarcely\r\ntroubling those of us who were preparing the specimen. Fortunately the\r\nsuffering from mosquitoes and black flies on the Barrens is largely\r\nlimited to the months of July and August.\r\n\r\nEven at this season the Caribou are granted occasional relief from the\r\nblood-sucking flies. The characteristic strong winds of that region help\r\ngreatly in keeping the insects in abeyance. Furthermore, both mosquitoes\r\nand black flies become more or less inactive whenever the temperature\r\ndrops to the neighborhood of 45° (_cf._ Weber, 1950: 196), and this\r\nhappens fairly frequently even in mid-summer. Finally, the black flies\r\nretire during the hours of darkness; and short as these hours are, the\r\nrelief they bring is very noteworthy. These conditions offer something\r\nof a contrast to those surrounding the Woodland Caribou. It is difficult\r\nto see how that animal can secure a moment's respite from mosquito\r\nattacks, by day or night, through most of the summer. In its forested\r\nhabitat there is not sufficient lowering of the temperature nor\r\nsufficient penetration of strong winds. Hard as the life of the Barren\r\nGround Caribou may be, it seems to have a few advantages not available\r\nto the Woodland Caribou; and possibly it is these that have enabled it\r\nto attain a vastly greater population than the other species.\r\n\r\nOf 52 mosquito specimens brought back from the Windy River area, 39 were\r\n_Aedes nearcticus_ Dyar, 2 were probably _Aedes fitchii_ (F. and Y.),\r\nand the remaining 11 were of the same genus but not in condition for\r\nspecific determination (_cf._ Dyar, 1919; Weber, 1950: 196). _Ae.\r\nnearcticus_ is holarctic in distribution; in North America it occurs\r\nchiefly on the Barren Grounds, but is known from as far south as\r\nMontana. _Ae. fitchii_ ranges through the northern United States and\r\nCanada, north to the limit of trees. Of 26 black flies, all were\r\n_Simulium venustum_ Say, which occurs in northern Europe, Alaska, and\r\nLabrador, south to the Adirondacks, Illinois, Iowa, Georgia, and\r\nAlabama. (Names and ranges supplied by Dr. Alan Stone, of the United\r\nStates Bureau of Entomology and Plant Quarantine.) These mosquitoes and\r\nblack flies were presumably the species attacking the Caribou in the\r\nNueltin Lake region.\r\n\r\nThe effects of the two parasitic flies are felt nearly throughout the\r\nyear. The adult warble fly (_Oedemagena tarandi_) is seen in the Windy\r\nRiver area in August, when the Caribou are on their southward march. On\r\nAugust 22 Fred Schweder, Jr., secured three of them on freshly killed\r\nCaribou and another that alighted on himself--all on an island in Windy\r\nBay. His name for them is \"deer fly.\" He reported seeing about 50 of\r\nthem on this day (more than ever before), although he sighted only 10\r\nCaribou. As he remarked, these fuzzy flies look much like bumblebees.\r\nThree days later, along Little River, something buzzed past me while a\r\nband of Caribou were near. It was probably this species, although it\r\nsuggested a hummingbird almost as much as a bumblebee. On several\r\nsubsequent August days, while numbers of Caribou were passing very close\r\nto me, I detected no more of the warble flies. In general, they might\r\nwell have escaped my notice owing to my preoccupation with photography;\r\nbut on August 30, when I looked for them on one of the nearest animals,\r\nI saw none. Evidently they are not sufficiently numerous (like\r\nhorse-flies on cattle) to be constantly in attendance on each Caribou.\r\nIn fact, a comparative scarcity (or at least difficulty of capture) may\r\nbe surmised from the fact that the Canadian Arctic Expedition 1913-18\r\nbrought back only three adult females--one from Teller, Alaska, and two\r\nfrom Bernard Harbour, Dolphin and Union Strait (Malloch, 1919: 55).\r\nWeber (1950) collected no Oestridae in Arctic Alaska.\r\n\r\nApparently there has been scarcely any published study of the egg-laying\r\nor other habits of the adult _Oedemagena_ in relation to _Rangifer\r\narcticus arcticus_, other than a few recent notes by Banfield (1951a:\r\n31-32, fig. 17); but its behavior in relation to the Lapland Reindeer\r\nseems to be fairly well known, and it is summarized by Jacobi (1931:\r\n245-246). In the case of the Reindeer, the fly's eggs are laid (during\r\nthe summer) generally on the legs, belly, and tail region of the victim;\r\nthe larvae, on hatching, bore through the skin, travel widely through\r\nthe body, and finally (in the autumn) reach the place for further\r\ndevelopment--beneath the skin of the back on both sides of the vertebral\r\ncolumn. Each one makes a breathing-hole through the skin, and uses this\r\nas an exit when leaving the host in the following June. Only the younger\r\nanimals, from one to about four or five years old, are heavily infested;\r\nthose still older are spared, possibly having learned to guard\r\nthemselves better against the fly. Curiously enough, the fawns are said\r\nto escape this parasitism entirely.\r\n\r\nMy own observations on the larvae were restricted to a few Caribou\r\nspecimens in June and in the autumn. As with the Reindeer, the Caribou\r\nfawns in their first autumn showed no visible infestation, as I noted in\r\nlooking over some fresh hides on September 10, and as was noted again in\r\na fawn of September 26. Fred Schweder, Jr., made the remark that larvae\r\nwould be evident in the fawns by the following spring; this may indicate\r\nthat the larvae have not, in the autumn, completed their journey to\r\ntheir final position on the Caribou's back. I learned of no immunity on\r\nthe part of old adults.\r\n\r\nFullgrown larvae still remained in bucks secured on June 3 (fig. 17) and\r\n18. According to Charles Schweder, they drop out in June. In the buck of\r\nJune 3 there were perhaps several dozen warbles, each surrounded by a\r\nmass of repulsive tissue; in another buck of June 18, there were\r\napparently more than 75. \"It may be assumed,\" says Johansen (1921: 24),\r\n\"that the pupae lie on the ground for about a month before the flies\r\nappear.\" He found (1921: 29) the adult flies abroad at Dolphin and Union\r\nStrait by July 14.\r\n\r\nIn a buck of August 17 the new warbles (or perhaps merely warble scars\r\nfrom the previous June--_cf._ Banfield, 1951a: 32) on the inside of\r\nthe skin were not very numerous. Some were medium-sized, but most were\r\nso small that it was not deemed necessary to scrape them off; they had\r\ncomparatively little fatty tissue about them and were merely allowed to\r\ndry up. The number of warbles (or warble scars) found in autumn\r\nspecimens varied considerably, up to a maximum of roughly 200. They were\r\nsituated mostly along the mid-dorsum, and more on the lower back or rump\r\nthan farther forward. The number appeared to be approximately 130 in the\r\nskin of an adult doe that was nailed to the log wall of a cabin for\r\ndrying on September 15 (fig. 18). A doe of September 21 seemed to have\r\nless than the usual number of warbles.\r\n\r\nThe nostril fly (_Cephenemyia_) is another serious dipterous parasite of\r\nthe Caribou. The life history of the European _C. nasalis_ (L.) (or\r\n_C. trompe_ [L.]) and its effect on Reindeer are discussed by Bergman\r\n(1917), Natvig (1918), and Jacobi (1931: 245) as follows.\r\n\r\nThis fly attacks the host from June to September, depositing its\r\nviviparous larvae in the nostrils. The Reindeer attempts to fend off the\r\nfly, striking at it with its hoofs and keeping its nostrils closed as\r\nfar as possible. Once deposited, the lively larvae crawl into the inner\r\nnasal passages and as far as the larynx, where they fasten themselves\r\nand live on the mucus. A Reindeer may harbor as many as 130 of these\r\nparasites. They range from 6 to 26 mm. in length. Their particular\r\ngrowth begins at the end of March, and they are ready for pupation up to\r\nMay. The host assists their exit by continual sneezing and snuffling. In\r\nthe last stages they are a great affliction for the host, and they\r\nsometimes cause its death. Pupation takes place in or on the ground,\r\nunder some sort of cover, and it lasts for 15-19 days. The flies have\r\nbeen found emerging from July 12 to 31.\r\n\r\nThe corresponding parasite of the Barren Ground Caribou is a similar or\r\nperhaps identical species, with a parallel life history. Its chief\r\nactivity as an adult doubtless occurs in July and August. A number of\r\nthe mature larvae were found in the throat of the buck of June 3; two of\r\nthem that were preserved measure approximately 7 mm. in diameter and 27\r\nand 30 mm. in length. A large mass of such sizable parasites in the\r\nthroat might easily become a serious obstacle to comfortable living or\r\neven to survival on the part of the host. Presumably the larvae drop to\r\nthe ground at about the same period as those of _Oedemagena_. Fred\r\nSchweder, Jr., remarked concerning the buck of August 17 that these\r\nlarvae are never found at that season, and Charles Schweder made the\r\nsame remark concerning a doe specimen of September 21. It would appear\r\neither that they remain so small as to escape detection at this time or\r\nthat they do not reach the throat on their short journey from the\r\nnostrils until some later period of the year. Johansen (1921: 24)\r\nrecords larvae only 2-3 mm. long in the nasal passage at the end of May.\r\n\r\nSince the bulk of the Caribou population has passed well to the\r\nnorthward of the Nueltin Lake region by the time the larvae of\r\n_Oedemagena_ and _Cephenemyia_ drop out of the bodies of their hosts to\r\npupate briefly on or in the ground (say in the latter part of June), one\r\nis tempted to speculate on the possibility that the adult flies found\r\nhere in August may have followed their prospective victims for many\r\nmiles in their southward migration. However, Porsild remarks (1943: 386)\r\nthat they \"apparently do not travel very far.\"\r\n\r\nCertain kinds of behavior exhibited by the Caribou in attempting to fend\r\noff the parasitic flies are discussed in the section on _Shaking off\r\nmoisture and insects_.\r\n\r\nThe adults of _Oedemagena tarandi_ (L.) were determined by Mr. C. W.\r\nSabrosky, of the Bureau of Entomology and Plant Quarantine; and the\r\nlarvae of _Oedemagena_ and _Cephenemyia_ by Dr. W. W. Wirth, of the same\r\nbureau. The larvae of the latter genus are regarded as probably _C.\r\ntrompe_ (L.); they were new to the collection of the United States\r\nNational Museum.\r\n\r\n  _References._--Hearne, 1795: 197; Franklin, 1823: 241;\r\n  Richardson, \"1825\": 328-330, and 1829: 242; Godman, 1831, +2+:\r\n  284; Murray, 1858: 210; B. R.

The Schweder boys spoke of never having noticed\r\nany such parasites. Seton (1929) mentions none, and Jacobi (1931: 243)\r\nrecords only a louse (_Linognathus tarandi_) from the Reindeer. \"Lice\r\nare not known from caribou according to Ferris (in conversation)\"\r\n(Weber, 1950: 154).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Relations to Reindeer_\r\n\r\nRecent discussions of the possibility or advisability of introducing\r\ndomesticated Reindeer to replace, or to augment the diminishing supply\r\nof, native American Caribou in various new localities prompt a brief\r\nreview of the subject.\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked at the outset that acclimatization attempts in the\r\nOld World have generally been abortive. Wild Reindeer introduced from\r\nFinmark into Iceland in the eighteenth century flourished for a time,\r\nbut by 1917 they were almost exterminated. A number of different\r\nintroductions into Great Britain, Denmark, Germany, Austria,\r\nSwitzerland, and Italy came to naught. On the other hand, the\r\nintroduction of Lapland Reindeer on the subantarctic island of South\r\nGeorgia in 1908 seems to have turned out successfully. (Jacobi, 1931:\r\n158-165; Harper, 1945: 473-474.) A saving feature in each of the\r\nabove-mentioned cases was the absence of any native Reindeer whose\r\nracial purity might have been destroyed by the newcomers.\r\n\r\nDecrease of local American stocks of Caribou, and consequent suffering\r\nof native populations who had in past generations depended upon these\r\nanimals for a major portion of their food supply, have led to\r\nintroduction of foreign Reindeer in several regions of North America,\r\nfrom Newfoundland and Labrador in the east to Alaska in the west. The\r\npersons responsible were doubtless inspired by high humanitarian\r\nmotives; but it is doubtful if they could have thoroughly considered or\r\nforeseen the serious biological consequences of their efforts.\r\n\r\nIn Alaska, importation of domesticated Siberian Reindeer began in 1892.\r\nBy the 1930's the herds had increased to an estimated total of 600,000.\r\nFor various reasons, however, the industry has so far declined that by\r\n1949 the total number of Alaskan Reindeer had become reduced to about\r\n28,000 head. Disinclination of Eskimos for reindeer-herding and mixture\r\nof their stock with wild Caribou were important reasons for this\r\ndecline. (Lantis, 1950.) From the biologist's point of view, the most\r\nunfortunate result was the large-scale interbreeding with the native\r\nGrant's Caribou (_Rangifer arcticus granti_) and the progressive\r\nextermination of that fine animal in a pure form by dilution with\r\ninferior alien blood. Among Alaskan Reindeer, \"constant inbreeding has\r\nled to a noticeable reduction in the prolificness of the females, and\r\ndegeneration is to be observed in many herds\" (Hewitt, 1921: 323).\r\n\r\nIn 1908 Dr. Wilfred T. Grenfell brought 300 Lapland Reindeer to\r\nNewfoundland. After some years they were transferred to the north shore\r\nof the Gulf of St. Lawrence and finally to the island of Anticosti.\r\n(Hewitt, 1921: 324-328; Seton, 1929, +3+: 92.) In 1911, 50 of these\r\nReindeer were shipped from Newfoundland to the Slave River region. Most\r\nof them escaped (probably to contaminate the local stock of Caribou),\r\nand by 1916 the last survivor of this band in captivity had succumbed\r\n(Hewitt, 1921: 329-330).\r\n\r\n\"A large part of the reindeer in Alaska are south of the Arctic Circle\r\non the comparatively mild shores of Bering Sea, where there are several\r\nmonths of open tidewater navigation; vegetation is more luxuriant [than\r\nin Arctic Canada] and conditions easier in general. There the reindeer\r\nwere introduced into a country where the wild caribou had been virtually\r\nexterminated, and a large native population were anxious to take up a\r\nnew mode of support. The percentage of profits has appeared unduly large\r\nin Alaska because statisticians have been unable to take into account\r\nthe value of the services of a large body of devoted missionaries,\r\ngovernment teachers, and other unselfish persons who put their best\r\nefforts into years of unpaid extra work to make the reindeer successful\r\nand beneficial to their charges.\r\n\r\n\"Canada has a large area of Arctic and sub-arctic lands beyond the reach\r\nof possible cultivation, still occupied by large numbers of wild caribou\r\nand remnants of musk-oxen, with native inhabitants who derive a living\r\nfrom them and add to the national wealth by fur production. These\r\nIndians and Eskimos are still far from being either able or willing to\r\nenter upon a pastoral stage of existence, and moreover, they are now\r\nenjoying an era of prosperity from the fur industry which may be\r\ntemporary, but which they will not relinquish for the slower and less\r\nprofitable prospects of the herder.\" (R. M. Anderson, 1924: 330-331.)\r\n\r\nIn 1921 some Norwegian Reindeer were landed at Amadjuak, Baffin Island\r\n(Seton, 1929, +3+: 92). The lack of further reference to the Baffin\r\nIsland animals by such subsequent investigators as Manning and Soper\r\nwould seem to indicate that the reindeer have not survived, unless\r\nthrough mixture with the native Caribou. An attempt in 1922 at\r\nacclimatization in Michigan \"ended in total failure\" (Seton, 1929, +3+:\r\n93).\r\n\r\n\"The Barren Grounds . . . still feed enormous herds of caribou. . . .\r\nThe greatest danger to this industry [reindeer-raising] is just these\r\nwild herds, which would be very apt to absorb the tame animals. This\r\nproblem may perhaps become a fatal one to the Eskimos, for there might\r\nvery easily come a most difficult transitional period, when the caribou\r\nwould be too few in numbers to form a definite basis for the existence\r\nof the people, but on the other hand numerous enough to make reindeer\r\nbreeding difficult.\" (Birket-Smith, 1933: 121.)\r\n\r\nIn northwestern Alaska \"large numbers of reindeer are constantly\r\nescaping the herders and joining the wild caribou. It seems that it will\r\nbe but a short time until there will be no pure bred caribou along that\r\npart of the coast. . . . As the reindeer are protected, and the caribou\r\nare killed at every opportunity, the former will doubtless prove the\r\ndominant animal and in time overcome the caribou, with hybridization the\r\ninevitable result.\" (Bailey and Hendee, 1926: 22.)\r\n\r\n\"The caribou's greatest menace is not the wolf, nor the hunter, but\r\nman's economic developments, principally the raising of reindeer.\r\nWherever reindeer herds are introduced, caribou must of course\r\ndisappear, for both cannot occupy the same range. The disappearance of\r\nthe caribou along the Bering Sea and Arctic coasts, while regrettable,\r\nwas unavoidable in view of the development of reindeer herding in this\r\nsection, which is ideal for the purpose. . . .\r\n\r\n\"The mingling of reindeer with the main caribou herds should be avoided.\r\nReindeer herds maintained in close contact with migrating caribou suffer\r\nfrequent losses through strays. Already the domestic reindeer are\r\nmingling with the caribou herd of Mount McKinley National Park. . . .\r\n[Hybridization] would be regrettable in interior Alaska, which has\r\nproduced a splendid type of wild caribou, coming near at least to being\r\nthe largest on the continent.\" (Murie, 1935: 7.)\r\n\r\nMurie's extensive experience with these animals in Alaska has led him to\r\nremark further (1939: 245):\r\n\r\n\"The greatest hazard to the Caribou is the possible occupation of the\r\nrange by man's agricultural activities. . . . The most serious danger is\r\nintroduction of domesticated Reindeer on wild Caribou range, for the\r\nwild herds must be removed in order to make possible the safe herding of\r\nthe domestic animals. . . . There is not room for both of these animals\r\non the same or closely adjacent ranges.\"\r\n\r\nPorsild points out (1943: 386, 389) that sparsely covered grazing areas\r\nare suitable for Caribou but not for Reindeer; and that the former\r\ndisappear before expanding Reindeer culture.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps the worst threat of all to the caribou has been the\r\nintroduction of reindeer culture along the arctic coast. This has\r\nresulted in interbreeding between the wild caribou and their inferior\r\ndomesticated relatives. When and if this mixture extends to all the\r\nherds of the Barren Grounds, the caribou may be written off the record\r\nas a pure species; the animal will have become extinct through dilution,\r\nas the biologists express it.\" (Harper, 1949: 239.)\r\n\r\nThe American Society of Mammalogists, at its annual meeting in 1950,\r\npassed the following resolution (_Jour. Mammalogy_ +31+ (4): 483, 1950):\r\n\r\n\"That the American Society of Mammalogists urges that the Canadian\r\nGovernment not undertake the introduction of reindeer into Ungava.\r\nBefore any introduction even is seriously considered, those persons\r\ninvolved in any planning are urged to make a thorough study beforehand\r\nof the problems of integrating lichen ecology, reindeer biology, and\r\nnative culture--serious problems that have not been solved to date on\r\nany workable scale on the North American continent. It would be\r\nparticularly deplorable if an introduction, to aid the natives, led to\r\nearly successes and high hopes, then eventual failure.\"\r\n\r\nPorsild, who knows the Reindeer thoroughly at first hand, has made\r\n(1951: 53) the following observation:\r\n\r\n\"Thus far these experiments [at introduction into America] have met with\r\nonly partial or indifferent success, because reindeer nomadism is\r\nincompatible with present trends of cultural development and because the\r\nNorth American Arctic is too thinly populated to provide a ready market\r\nfor reindeer products.\"\r\n\r\nReferring to the region of the Brooks Range in northern Alaska, Rausch\r\nsays (1951: 190):\r\n\r\n\"The mixture of inferior reindeer bloodlines with the native caribou is\r\nserious. This has already occurred to a considerable degree, and it is\r\nhoped that proper control will be exercised if the reindeer industry is\r\nrevived in Alaska. Ear-notched animals have been killed in the Anaktuvuk\r\nPass country, and white reindeer have been seen running with the\r\ncaribou. The number of unrecognized reindeer passing through could be\r\ngreat.\"\r\n\r\nAt present the Barren Ground Caribou is apparently the third most\r\nabundant member of the deer family on our continent, being exceeded by\r\nthe White-tailed Deer and the Mule Deer (_cf._ Jackson, 1944: 7-8). No\r\nother member of this family could be expected to be so eminently and\r\nthoroughly adapted to its Arctic environment or to thrive so well on the\r\nvery ground where nature has been molding and perfecting its characters\r\nfor thousands of years. No naturally occurring relative--Moose, Deer, or\r\nWoodland Caribou--undertakes to compete with it on its own particular\r\nrange. It requires practically nothing for the maintenance--and\r\nincrease--of its present numbers, other than an enlightened policy of\r\nconservation. (As indicated on a previous page, the feminine wearers of\r\nArctic Fox furs must bear a heavy share of responsibility for the\r\ndecline of the Barren Ground Caribou in recent decades.) Our highest\r\nauthorities have pointed out the impracticability of Caribou and\r\nReindeer occupying the same range.\r\n\r\nWould it not be the part of wisdom to exclude the inferior domesticated\r\nalien, with its difficult and generally unsuccessful culture in North\r\nAmerica, and thereby to give the wonderful wild Caribou of the Barrens\r\nits best chance for survival?\r\n\r\n  _References._--Chambers, 1914: 350-351; Hornaday, 1914, +2+:\r\n  105-108; Hewitt, 1921: 323, 329-330; R. M.

A definite reduction is indicated along the Arctic coast and on\r\nthe Arctic islands (R. M. Anderson, 1937: 103, and 1938: 400; Banfield,\r\n1949: 478, 481, and 1951a: 13-14). While large numbers still remain in\r\nsouthwestern Keewatin, there are no reports of any such mass occurrence\r\nas was witnessed by the Tyrrell brothers on the upper Dubawnt River on\r\nJuly 29, 1893; that throng was estimated at 100,000 to 200,000 animals\r\n(J. B. Tyrrell, 1897: 165).\r\n\r\nDuring the big movement of the last week of August, 1947, I may have\r\nseen as many as 500 Caribou on one or two days, in herds numbering up to\r\n150 individuals. A striking proportion of those observed seemed to occur\r\nin bands of roughly 25 animals. On August 25 Fred Schweder, Jr.,\r\nreported about a thousand crossing Little River, in bands of as many as\r\n100 individuals. On October 11 Charles Schweder observed a thousand\r\nCaribou resting on a hill 3 miles long in the vicinity of Four-hill\r\nCreek. In November he found thousands, in herds up to 300 strong, moving\r\nsouth from the upper Kazan River. These figures may give a faintly\r\napproximate idea of the numbers occurring in the general region of\r\nNueltin Lake in a year considered less good than an average one. On the\r\nother hand, toward the coast of Hudson Bay, there were reports of a\r\ngreater number of autumn migrants than in ordinary years.\r\n\r\nIn October, about 1944, tracks indicated that 2,000 or 3,000 animals had\r\ncrossed Windy River in the vicinity of Four-hill Creek in the night\r\n(_fide_ Charles Schweder). About October 10, 1946 (a year of unusual\r\nabundance), Fred Schweder, Jr., witnessed the passage of thousands in\r\none day in this vicinity; he got the impression of \"the hills moving\r\nwith Deer.\" (Yet this was the season when the Caribou passed mainly to\r\none side of the upper Kazan River, so that nearly one-third of the local\r\nband of Eskimos starved to death.) In the first part of May, about 1942\r\nor 1943, John Ingebrigtsen came to a nameless lake, about half a mile by\r\na mile and a half in extent, somewhere east of Duck Lake, Manitoba. It\r\nappeared \"absolutely full of Caribou,\" and he estimated their number at\r\nnot less than 20,000. This would mean a density of no more than about 50\r\nper acre.\r\n\r\n  _References._--Jones, 1899: 368, 374; J. B.

They exhibit a\r\ndefinite tendency to pause and rest also toward the middle of the day.\r\nSeveral instances have already been given of the animals resting at such\r\na time on frozen lakes and rivers: lakes southwest of Reindeer Lake,\r\nMarch 18; lakes south of Lake Athabaska, April 16; Seal River, May 31;\r\nWindy Bay, June 6 (mid-morning). Open hilltops are evidently sought\r\nlikewise for both nocturnal and mid-day rests: knoll by Windy River,\r\nJune 3; Josie's Hill, June 20; ridge by Little River, August 24 (about 9\r\na.m.). (For details, see sections on _Winter range_, _Spring migration_,\r\nand _Fall migration_.)\r\n\r\nAlthough we noted a small band of Caribou passing through a thick and\r\nextensive stand of spruce at dusk on October 2, Fred Schweder, Jr.,\r\nremarked that they do not rest in such a place; they are safer from\r\nWolves in open areas. Charles Schweder reported about 50 Caribou, in\r\nthree slightly separated bands, appearing on the south side of Windy\r\nRiver near Four-hill Creek during the evening of September 24, but not\r\nmaking up their minds to cross; he thought they might have been scared\r\nby Wolves. Possibly there was a similar explanation for the crossing of\r\nthe river at this point by large numbers of the animals during an\r\nOctober night several years previously.\r\n\r\nAccording to Fred Schweder, Jr., a day's movement of Caribou past the\r\nmouths of Little and Windy rivers during the fall migration generally\r\ndoes not commence before 10 a.m. and ends about 3 p.m. The explanation\r\nof such a phenomenon is none too obvious; and in any event, there were\r\nexceptions enough, though the general statement may hold true for the\r\nbulk of the migrants. As remarked in the section on _Spring migration_,\r\nthe daily periods when the Caribou crossed the ice of Windy Bay were\r\nmainly from 10 to 11 a.m., from 2:30 to 5 p.m., and in the evening.\r\n\r\nOn August 27, about 5:50 p.m., a majority (say half a dozen) of a small\r\nband of Caribou were lying down on a slope near the mouth of Little\r\nRiver. They faced down wind to watch for enemies in that direction,\r\nwhile their noses would warn them of any approaching from the opposite\r\ndirection. Their attitude was very much like that of Norway Reindeer\r\nfigured by Seton (1929, +3+: pls. 11, 15, 18).\r\n\r\nCharles Schweder spoke of having seen whole herds lying down to rest,\r\nwhile none of the animals remained standing up on guard. He had noted\r\none such herd of 600 or 700 along the Thlewiaza River in August. He\r\nfurther stated that when the Caribou lie down to rest and to chew the\r\ncud, they hold the head up. They may also sleep in this position. In the\r\nhard winter of 1944-45, when the snow was deep and the animals were\r\ntired and hungry, he came up to a resting herd. All but one of them got\r\nup and moved away. That one remained sleeping, head up and eyes closed;\r\nCharles walked up to within 10 feet and shot it. He has also seen\r\nresting Caribou lay their heads down on the side, but only for a few\r\nmoments at a time.\r\n\r\n  _References._--J. B. Tyrrell, 1892: 129; Jones, 1899: 359;\r\n  Harper, 1949: 227; Banfield, 1951a: 23.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Organization of herds_\r\n\r\nThe Barren Ground Caribou is a distinctly gregarious species. It goes in\r\nherds for at least the greater part of the year; this is especially true\r\nof the spring and autumn migration periods and of the winter months. We\r\nknow comparatively little of the behavior of the does at fawning time in\r\nJune; but probably there is a tendency toward solitariness on their part\r\nat that season. It is true that solitary Caribou may be met with at\r\nalmost any season of the year; but this doubtless represents merely\r\ntemporary rather than permanent segregation of such individuals. At the\r\nvery end of the spring migration and at the beginning of the autumn\r\nmigration, there may be, among the sparse southernmost elements of the\r\npopulation, a larger proportion of solitary animals.\r\n\r\nWhile marching over the Barrens and feeding as they go, the smaller\r\nbands maintain a fairly loose organization, as apparently best suiting\r\ntheir needs. On the other hand, the huge herds of former times, such as\r\nthe Tyrrells met on the upper Dubawnt in 1893 (J. B. Tyrrell, 1897:\r\n49-50, pl. 1; J. W. Tyrrell, 1908: pls. facing pp. 80, 81; Seton, 1929,\r\n+3+: pl. 22), obviously maintained very compact ranks. In my limited\r\nexperience, the animals bunched more closely in crossing the rivers than\r\nwas normally the case on land among feeding herds. While swimming, they\r\nwould follow each other in files at minimum intervals; but in stepping\r\nacross rapids they might extend these intervals somewhat.\r\n\r\nWhen merely covering ground, without stopping to feed, or when following\r\na trail through brush or along a narrow ridge, there is a strong\r\ntendency for the animals to go in a single file, or at least in a\r\nprocession many times longer than wide. This was also apparent when they\r\nwere crossing the ice of Windy Bay in June.\r\n\r\nWhen Caribou flee from some source of alarm, a distinct tendency toward\r\ncompact bunching may be observed. This may have been developed as a\r\nmeasure of protection from pursuing Wolves; the latter could naturally\r\novercome a straggling or isolated individual more readily than one in a\r\ncompact herd. The Caribou running away from the train in the \"Little\r\nBarrens\" south of Churchill very clearly demonstrated the tendency\r\ntoward a close formation. (See also, in the section on _Disposition_,\r\nthe account of a herd attacked by a hunter near Lake Charles.)\r\n\r\nThe larger herds of the autumn migration seemed to be generally composed\r\nof all sexes and ages; yet some sizable bands were made up chiefly of\r\nbucks on the one hand, or of does and fawns on the other hand. The rear\r\nguard of the spring migration and the vanguard of the autumn migration\r\nare generally composed of bucks, traveling either singly or in small\r\nbands; this state of affairs is looked upon as evidence that the\r\nmajority of the bucks do not advance so far to the north in June and\r\nJuly as the does do.\r\n\r\nThe following are a few examples of the composition and leadership (or\r\nrear-guarding) of groups of Caribou. (Other examples are mentioned in\r\nthe sections on _Migration_.) A band of about 20, after feeding for a\r\ntime on the south bank of Windy River on June 16, moved off upstream,\r\nmostly in single file, with a patriarchal buck in the lead. The\r\nremainder of the band included several lesser bucks and various does and\r\nyearlings. On the following day a band of equal size, composed chiefly\r\nof bucks but including three hornless individuals (does?), was led by\r\ntwo of the bigger bucks. When a band of some 40 does and fawns\r\napproached Little River to cross it on August 25, a doe came first to\r\nthe water's edge to make a careful inspection. On the same day I\r\nremarked having noted several times that a buck brought up the rear of a\r\nband. On August 26 I noted that a distinct majority in the herds of the\r\nprevious two or three days were does and fawns, although there were\r\ngenerally a few bucks present also. At this period I got the impression\r\nthat the number of individuals in a band was frequently not far from 25.\r\nOn August 28, when a band of 40 crossed the mouth of Little River, three\r\nor four bucks plunged in first, but a doe was almost even with them. At\r\nthe Bear Slough, on September 3, a group consisted of two bucks, two\r\ndoes, and a fawn. On September 15 Fred Schweder, Jr., reported seeing\r\nabout 100 Caribou, with not a buck among them. On September 24 about 15\r\ndoes and fawns were resting or feeding quietly by Glacier Pond. On\r\nSeptember 28 a band of six large bucks crossed the Camp Ridge. On\r\nOctober 1, an older and a younger buck appeared in the shoal waters of\r\nDuck Bay. On November 3, in the same locality, a band of about 50 was\r\ncomposed largely of does, but included a few fawns and a few\r\nwell-antlered bucks. On November 11 five does were reported crossing the\r\nmouth of Windy River on the ice.\r\n\r\nCharles Schweder remarked that the leader of a band is generally a doe;\r\nbut sometimes it is a buck, or even a fawn. There is virtually no way of\r\ntelling whether the same doe habitually leads a band. In the big migrant\r\nherds, bucks bring up the rear. Once in September, in a herd of about\r\n100 animals, the front half was composed of does and fawns, the rear\r\nhalf of bucks. In the rutting season the does are naturally in the lead,\r\nthe bucks following them.\r\n\r\n  _References._--Hearne, 1795: 198; Richardson, \"1825\": 329;\r\n  Simpson, 1843: 277, 281, 381; J.

It is fortunate that its\r\nrange lies so far from the centers of civilization. It is scarcely\r\nconceivable that it could survive, as the White-tailed Deer does, in\r\nsome of our most thickly settled areas. At the river crossings, where I\r\nwatched the pageant of migration for day after day, some of the animals\r\nwould come up to within a rod while I handled my cameras in the open,\r\nwith no more cover than knee-high bushes and rocks (figs. 11, 14). Where\r\nelse, among the larger creatures of the wilderness, could one find such\r\na close approximation to a Garden-of-Eden existence? Until they detected\r\nthe human scent, they would stare at me at such close quarters with\r\nlittle more concern than so many barnyard cattle. (For examples, see the\r\nsection on _Fall migration_.) Moreover, there were occasions when they\r\nmust have gotten my wind and still did not show panic. There is an\r\nobvious deficiency of eyesight or judgment, or both.\r\n\r\nTo account for their behavior on such occasions, I speculated as\r\nfollows. The species has scarcely any predatory enemies save man, the\r\nWolf, and (perhaps to some extent) the Wolverine. In their normal\r\nexperience, any such enemy, if within close range, would be making an\r\nattack. Thus a questionable figure, not becoming evident to them until\r\nthey are within close range, and then making no motion to attack, may be\r\ndismissed by them as something different and therefore harmless.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of unconcern has probably been developed in past\r\ngenerations through the habit of the Caribou of traveling in vast\r\nthrongs. The threat of danger to a given individual in a herd of, say,\r\n100,000 is practically negligible. From time immemorial the river\r\ncrossings have represented a particular point of attack on the part of\r\nthe natives. Yet when a large band of Caribou come to such a crossing,\r\nthey may plunge in with little pause or hesitation. On the other hand,\r\nwhen a lone doe with her fawn approaches the river bank, she may be very\r\ncircumspect, taking time to look carefully upstream and down, and\r\nacross, before venturing into the water. I also saw another doe with a\r\nfawn exercise similar precaution, when she was merely the first of a\r\nband of 40 to reach the river's edge. It is probably concern for her\r\nfawn that renders a doe more circumspect than a buck.\r\n\r\nWhen Fred Schweder, Jr., was endeavoring to intercept a Wolf on\r\nSeptember 6, a fullgrown buck came feeding around a tree within 10 feet\r\nof him. The animal winded Fred without apparently seeing him, and went\r\nback and forth uncertainly for about a minute; finally it moved off very\r\nslowly.\r\n\r\nStefánsson's account (1913b) of his various adventures with Caribou\r\nnear the Arctic coast of Mackenzie indicates a far wilder animal in that\r\nregion than the one in Keewatin. It appeared a great deal easier for me,\r\nwith no particular effort at caution, to get within photographic range\r\n(say a dozen feet to 50 yards) than for him to approach within rifle\r\nrange (several hundred yards).\r\n\r\nEven after being fired upon, a single animal or a band in the Nueltin\r\nLake region will rarely put distance between themselves and a hunter\r\nwith all possible dispatch, as an alert White-tailed Deer would, but\r\nwill run hither and thither in confusion, with frequent pauses to\r\ndisplay their befuddlement. On October 8 I was a distant and saddened\r\nspectator of a scene of slaughter. A hundred or more Caribou were\r\nresting or feeding quietly on a bare ridge south of Lake Charles. They\r\nwere distributed in a narrow formation, 75-100 yards long and from one\r\nto several animals deep. A hunter, approaching close to the south end of\r\nthe herd, began firing. With one accord they made toward the north, but\r\nvery shortly executed a sharp turn and came back rapidly in the opposite\r\ndirection, passing in a narrow, compact column within 30 feet of the\r\nhunter, who continued shooting. In 200 or 300 yards they paused and\r\nallowed the hunter to come up with them and resume shooting. The process\r\nwas repeated over a distance of three miles; but the pursuer now and\r\nthen circled ahead of the herd instead of following in its tracks. The\r\nfinal toll: 29 Caribou hit and 22 or 23 secured--virtually a quarter of\r\nthe herd destroyed and most of it to be used for dog feed.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the attachment between a doe and its fawn is such that\r\nwhen one of them is killed, the hunter can approach within 50 feet of\r\nthe surviving doe or within 20 feet of the surviving fawn. A fawn is apt\r\nto linger for days in the vicinity where its dam has been killed.\r\n\r\nCharles Schweder has never seen fawns playing with each other or with\r\ntheir mothers; two or three times he has seen one frisking by\r\nitself--such as jumping about or running in a circle--but never for more\r\nthan half a minute at a time. Seriousness of life for a Caribou seems\r\nconfirmed from its infancy.\r\n\r\nIn the hard winter of 1944-45, when the Caribou were tired and hungry,\r\nCharles had the rare experience of driving his dogteam right through\r\nherds on Nueltin Lake; the animals merely moved aside enough to let him\r\npass. In like vein Joe Chambers spoke of encountering such numbers of\r\nmigrating Caribou on or near the \"Little Barrens\" south of Churchill in\r\nthe spring of 1947 that his dogs \"went wild\" and he had to halt for a\r\ntime; the animals came within about 100 yards of his team.\r\n\r\nA Caribou bold enough to attack a man is very rarely heard of. Yet that\r\nwas the experience of 15-year-old Anoteelik on September 8. Having run\r\nout of ammunition, he undertook to kill a 2-year-old buck with a rock in\r\na patch of timber. (Possibly the animal had already been wounded with\r\nAnoteelik's .22 rifle.) When the missile failed of its mark, the buck\r\nmade for the boy, who escaped by climbing a tree. Perhaps this is the\r\nfirst case on record of a man or a boy (especially an Eskimo!) being\r\ntreed by a Barren Ground Caribou. Jenness mentions (1922: 150) a case of\r\nan Eskimo being fatally gored by a Caribou on Victoria Island.\r\nOtherwise, under all general circumstances, and in contradistinction to\r\nthe Bison, the Muskox, the Moose, and even the White-tailed Deer, the\r\nCaribou may be regarded as quite innocuous to man.\r\n\r\nThe restlessness so frequently exhibited by Caribou during the summer,\r\nin trotting rapidly over the Barrens or in feeding hurriedly here and\r\nthere while constantly forging ahead (in contrast to the placidity of\r\ngrazing sheep and cattle), may be attributed in large part to the\r\nrelentless scourge of fly pests.\r\n\r\n(See also _Relations to man_.)\r\n\r\n  _References._--Lyon, 1824: 336-337; J.

But perhaps the\r\nlast-mentioned attribute does not so much constitute poor eyesight as\r\nlack of _perception_ or _recognition_. In other words, is it not\r\npossible that the animal is merely deficient in interpreting what it may\r\nsee clearly enough?\r\n\r\n  _References._--R. M. Anderson, 1913a: 8, and 1913b: 504;\r\n  Stefánsson, 1913b: 164, 1914: 58, and 1921: 307; Blanchet,\r\n  1925: 34, and 1926b: 48; Birket-Smith, 1929 (1): 106; Seton,\r\n  1929, +3+: 104; Murie, 1939: 245; Banfield, 1951a: 22.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gaits_\r\n\r\nThe three principal gaits of the Caribou are walking, trotting, and\r\nloping. The animal seems to be in such a constant hurry that trotting is\r\nfairly habitual. The speed of this gait varies with the urgency of the\r\noccasion; also, according to Stefánsson (1921: 248), with sex and age.\r\nWhen frightened by an enemy, a Caribou may start off with a loping gait,\r\nbut it soon settles down to its space-consuming trot, which keeps it\r\nsafely ahead of a Wolf in any brief chase. The initial leap takes all\r\nfour feet off the ground at once (_cf._ Buchanan, 1920: 126). According\r\nto Charles Schweder, it is usually a single animal that reacts in this\r\nway; but he has seen as many as six together leaping into the air. Fred\r\nSchweder, Jr., has seen both bucks and does in this performance. My own\r\nobservations covered two lone adults (at least one a buck) and a lone\r\nfawn. One of the former turned and took a step or so before making the\r\nleap. The fawn (at Simons' Lake in October), after allowing a canoe to\r\napproach within 100 feet, started off twice in succession, and each time\r\nwith an initial leap into the air before settling down to a trot.\r\n\r\nEven a summer fawn is reputed to be able to outdistance a Wolf. Lyon\r\n(1824: 67) found a Caribou too fleet for a greyhound.\r\n\r\nIn trotting rapidly, a Caribou points its snout pretty straight to the\r\nfront, thus tilting the antlers backward a little. This gait, with front\r\nlegs stretching well out in front and hind legs thrust backward\r\ncorrespondingly, gives a very characteristic and distinctive stamp to\r\nthe appearance of a fast-trotting Caribou. (Compare the sketches of\r\ntrotting Norway Reindeer by Seton, 1929, +3+: pls. 15, 18.) It is\r\napparently quite different from any normal gait of the White-tailed\r\nDeer. A buck's well-grown antlers are of such weight as apparently to\r\nforce it to hold its head rather rigidly while going at speed. If its\r\nhead swayed appreciably, the top-heavy antlers might tend to throw the\r\nanimal off balance. In a trotting gait, the hind foot may be planted\r\njust beyond the spot where the front foot had rested. In walking, the\r\nprint of the hind foot may be superimposed on that of the other (fig.\r\n20). The white \"spats\" just above the hoofs show to fine advantage when\r\nthe Caribou trots; they fairly twinkle. In a retreating animal the white\r\nrump-patch appears in marked contrast to the dark brown adjacent fur.\r\n\r\nIn stepping across a shallow rapid in peaceful surroundings, the\r\nrhythmic splashings of the water to the front and the sides of the\r\nalternately descending hoofs make a scene of rare charm. In moving\r\nthrough deeper water, where the bottom is rough, rocky, and slippery,\r\nthe animals may pick their way quite slowly. When alarmed near the\r\nwater's edge from some such cause as detecting a human scent, they may\r\nmake great splashing leaps into a river or bay, fairly enveloping\r\nthemselves in huge clouds of spray. There can be few more spirited\r\nscenes of animal life in the North.\r\n\r\nI have seen several of the animals running with open mouths, even when\r\nthey had gone no more than a quarter of a mile from a point of alarm.\r\nEvery now and then a Caribou will be seen limping--perhaps from wounds,\r\nperhaps because of a leg sprained in rough terrain.\r\n\r\n  _References._--Lyon, 1824: 67; Osborn, 1865: 227; Russell, 1895:\r\n  50, and 1898: 90; Hanbury, 1904: 131; Nelson, 1916: 460;\r\n  Buchanan, 1920: 126; Stefánsson, 1921: 248; Blanchet, 1925: 33,\r\n  and 1926b: 47; Critchell-Bullock, 1930: 193; Sutton and\r\n  Hamilton, 1932: 83; Ingstad, 1933: 87; Murie, 1939: 245; Downes,\r\n  1943: 236-237; Harper, 1949: 226, 229; Banfield, 1951a: 21.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tracks_\r\n\r\nCaribou trails, resulting from the impact of countless hoofs on the same\r\nrestricted courses for unnumbered years, have been discussed in the\r\nsection on _Ecology_. The placing of the feet has been touched upon in\r\nthe section on _Gaits_. The individual tracks remain to be considered.\r\n\r\nEach of two foot-prints photographed in mud was approximately 4 inches\r\n(102 mm.) long and 4½ inches (114 mm.) wide. Another such photograph\r\n(fig. 19) shows tracks about 114 by 95 and 102 by 102 mm. The foot\r\nsketched by Seton (1929, +3+: 129) is obviously a front foot, though not\r\nso labeled; the hoofs as drawn are approximately 89 and 93 mm. in\r\nlength; the width of the foot is approximately 100 mm.\r\n\r\nA track (fig. 20) photographed in 2-inch snow represents a hind\r\nfoot-print superimposed upon a front foot-print in a walking gait;\r\nincluding the marks of the dew claws, it was approximately 6 inches (153\r\nmm.) long and 5 inches (127 mm.) wide. The \"square-toed\" appearance is\r\nvery characteristic.\r\n\r\nA front hoof is a little broader as well as longer than a hind hoof\r\n(fig. 24). The extreme and average lengths of the front hoofs in five of\r\nmy adult male specimens are 80-92 (85.2); of the hind hoofs, 74-84.5\r\n(79.8). In an adult doe a front hoof measures 77; a hind hoof, 72.\r\n\r\n  _Reference._--Banfield, 1951a: 19.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Swimming_\r\n\r\nIn their extensive and long-continued migrations over a territory\r\ncomposed in large part of lakes, ponds, and rivers, the Caribou have\r\nalmost daily need, from June to October, of surmounting these barriers\r\nby swimming. The low temperature of the water seems to have no deterring\r\neffect on them. Yet it appears that some of the animals may fail in\r\nattempting the passages of wide waters. Charles Schweder spoke of\r\nfinding a number of dead Caribou, including bucks as well as fawns, that\r\nhad apparently succumbed in crossing a 4-mile-wide lake on the Thlewiaza\r\nRiver. (Or had they perhaps come to grief in some upstream rapid and\r\nfinally been washed ashore on the lake?) Bones on the shore indicated\r\nthat this sort of tragedy might be more or less of an annual occurrence.\r\nPerhaps some of the victims had been wounded or were otherwise in poor\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nThe buoyant, hollow hairs of a Caribou's coat enable the swimming animal\r\nto keep almost the whole median dorsal line of its body perhaps 2 or 3\r\ninches above the surface (figs. 9, 12). In a doe noticed on August 28\r\nthe lowest point on the top of the neck, just in front of the shoulders,\r\nwas practically level with the surface, but elsewhere the dorsal line,\r\nfrom snout to tail, was out of the water. In both doe and fawn the head\r\nis held so high that the lower side of the snout at the tip does not\r\ntouch the water; in the older bucks of the autumn, however, the weight\r\nof their antlers presses the head down until the lower side of the snout\r\nis frequently in contact with the water. The swimming position tilts the\r\nantlers backward until the basal portion is practically horizontal\r\n(figs. 9, 12). All ages and sexes, while swimming, hold the tail nearly\r\nerect; but the very tip (perhaps only the tuft of hairs) inclines toward\r\nthe rear.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 19.

Stony Mountain, about 27 miles S. of Fort McMurray,\r\n    Alberta, October 22, 1920. (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.)]\r\n\r\nOn October 30 tracks indicated that half a dozen Caribou had swum across\r\nLittle River near its mouth, breaking through a 10-foot rim of ice on\r\nthe near side. When a herd of 2,000 or 3,000 crossed Windy River during\r\nan October night about 1944, as reported by Charles Schweder, they broke\r\nthree channels through the thin ice that covered the river.\r\n\r\nOnce Charles saw a buck cross the 100-yard-wide Nahiline Rapids on\r\nKasmere River, where it drops about 40 feet in a quarter of a mile; yet\r\nthe animal did not seem to be carried far downstream. When about 10\r\nCaribou (mostly big bucks) crossed the Windy River at our camp on June\r\n24, the last two, I noted, were pointing almost upstream in the 6- to\r\n8-mile-per-hour current.\r\n\r\nThe usual formation in which a small number of Caribou cross a bay or a\r\nquiet stretch of river is a single file, but a larger band is likely\r\nto make the passage in several simultaneous files. The fawns, in\r\nparticular, follow as closely as possible behind their mothers.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Caribou are strong and speedy swimmers, the natives are\r\nable, in canoe or kayak, to overtake and spear them. In 1947 several\r\nfawns were speared in Windy Bay by Anoteelik.\r\n\r\nOther notes on swimming may be found in the sections dealing with\r\n_Migrations_.\r\n\r\n  _References._--Back, 1836: 367; Simpson, 1843: 76, 310; Rae,\r\n  1850: 27; Richardson, 1852: 290; Schwatka, 1885: 68, 71-72;\r\n  W. J.

This is effected to a large extent by a\r\nvigorous shaking of the body, head, and ears and a switching of the\r\ntail. The initial performance, lasting for perhaps a second or two, may\r\nbe undertaken while the animal's lower extremities are still in the\r\nwater; and it is likely to be repeated from one to several times as it\r\nmoves over the shore and ascends the adjacent ridge. The cloud of spray\r\nflying off is a sight to behold (fig. 9). The action is very much like\r\nthat of a dog under similar circumstances. The fur may remain wet for a\r\nleast 10 or 15 minutes after emergence from the water. In driving rain\r\non September 5, I noticed an individual in a band of 20 Caribou shaking\r\nitself and sending the rain drops flying off in spray, just as when one\r\nemerges from the water.\r\n\r\nThe Caribou also go through a very similar but perhaps still more\r\nstrenuous performance for the obvious purpose of shaking off flies\r\n(perhaps primarily the warble flies, _Oedemagena_). On August 20 a buck\r\npassing along a ridge in the Barrens agitated the hide on its body\r\nseveral times with considerable vigor. A young animal (fawn or yearling)\r\nthus shook itself on August 28 as it approached the far side of Little\r\nRiver. I got the distinct impression that the hide was shaken\r\nhorizontally in the case of moisture, but vertically in the case of\r\ninsects; for the present, however, this is best considered as just an\r\nimpression, and not a statement of fact. The muscles that agitate the\r\nskin of the sides should be particularly well developed through frequent\r\npractice with water and flies during the warmer part of the year.\r\n\r\nAt the mouth of Little River, on August 30, I heard one of the Caribou\r\nin a large band \"blow its nose,\" so to speak, with vigor. The sound\r\nsuggested that produced by a horse in vibrating its nostrils by\r\nforcefully expelling air through them. I suspect that the Caribou uses\r\nthe same means, in an effort to fend off a nostril fly (_Cephenemyia_)\r\nbent on depositing its larvae.\r\n\r\n  _Reference._--Harper, 1949: 230.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Signaling_\r\n\r\nApparently the commonest method employed by the Caribou for indicating\r\nor communicating suspicion or alarm is erecting the stub of a tail to a\r\nvertical position. This brings its white under side into full view, as\r\nthe silent flashing of a danger signal to other Caribou. However,\r\na solitary animal will exhibit signaling behavior as well as one in a\r\nband. The tail remains erect, whether the animal stands to stare\r\nuneasily at a suspicious object or flees from it in alarm. The action is\r\ncommon to old and young of both sexes. It is so characteristic of a\r\nfleeing animal as to give significance to the expression, \"high-tailing\r\nit.\" In normal, unalarmed progress the tail extends backward in a\r\ndrooping curve (figs. 11, 12).\r\n\r\nI was not fortunate enough to detect any flashing of the white throat,\r\nas described by Preble (1902: 42).\r\n\r\nAnother silent signal is a most peculiar sprawling posture of the hind\r\nlegs, attained by thrusting one of them well out to one side and setting\r\nthe foot down. The legs are not then symmetrically placed; the one not\r\nmoved obviously bears most of the weight of the hind quarters. I managed\r\nto film this stance in a buck standing on a sky-line on August 24\r\n(cover). On September 9 another buck assumed the posture while looking\r\nover our camp from a ridge on the opposite side of Windy River.\r\nAccording to Charles Schweder, this is an expression of suspicion or\r\nalarm, designed to communicate the same feeling to other Caribou. When\r\nthe others notice it, they stop and assume the same pose; it may be\r\nobserved in does and even fawns. Charles added that the tail is erected\r\nat the same time--a very natural accompaniment, though I failed to\r\nnotice it.\r\n\r\nIn all the literature on the Barren Ground Caribou, I have found just\r\none reference to this posture, and that a distinctly fragmentary one:\r\n\r\n\"While [the Caribou are] thus circling around I have often been amused\r\nat the manner in which they carry one hind leg. A novice in the hunting\r\nfield, after having fired a shot in their direction, would think that he\r\nhad broken one hind leg of each member of the herd.\" (A. J. Stone, 1900:\r\n53.)\r\n\r\nThe author makes this observation just after mentioning a herd sighted\r\nnear the shore of Franklin Bay. A virtually identical posture in the\r\nNorway Reindeer has been sketched by Seton (1929, +3+: 112, pl. 18), who\r\nlabels it \"surprize.\" An analogy to the posture of the Caribou might be\r\nfound in a hand thrust out, with fingers spread, by a military scout as\r\na signal of warning or caution to his fellow scouts. A sprawling leg is\r\nperhaps the nearest approximation to the human signal that a Caribou can\r\nattain.\r\n\r\nAs noted in the section on _Gaits_, an alarmed Caribou may set off by\r\ntaking an initial leap into the air. According to Dugmore, such an act\r\non the part of the Newfoundland Caribou plays an important role in its\r\nsystem of communications, not by means of sight or sound, but through\r\nthe olfactory sense. He observes (1913: 89-90):\r\n\r\n\"For hours afterwards _every_ Caribou, on arriving at the place where\r\nthe frightened ones had jumped, has started violently, and has on nearly\r\nevery occasion turned and run in a manner that showed every indication\r\nof fear, even though my presence was entirely unknown to them. My idea\r\nis that when the animal is suddenly frightened it expels a certain fluid\r\nfrom the glands in the foot, and that this fluid is a signal of alarm,\r\na silent and invisible warning, but none the less so positive that none\r\ndare ignore it.\"\r\n\r\nAs for the foot click--a presumptive means of communication (_cf._\r\nSeton, 1929, +3+: 69; Jacobi, 1931: 212-216)--I must confess that I was\r\nalways so engrossed with photography whenever the Caribou were close\r\nat hand (up to within a dozen feet) that I had no thought of this\r\nphenomenon and did not detect it.\r\n\r\n  _References._--Richardson, 1829: 242; A. J. Stone, 1900: 53;\r\n  Preble, 1902: 42; Seton, 1929, +3+: 105; Murie, 1939: 245;\r\n  Harper, 1949: 230; Banfield, 1951a: 19, 27.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Food_\r\n\r\nThe ground lichens (including the various species of _Cladonia_) in the\r\nWindy River area in 1947 did not seem, for the most part, to have a\r\nheight of more than 2 or 3 inches. The average length of several local\r\nspecimens of _Cladonia_ is approximately 51 mm. This condition was in\r\nconsiderable contrast to the great spongy masses I had noted in the\r\nTazin River basin, between Athabaska and Great Slave lakes, in 1914.\r\nI have no means of knowing whether the condition in Keewatin represented\r\nsevere cropping by Caribou in past years and subsequent slow recovery,\r\nor whether it is a normal condition. According to Charles Schweder, the\r\ngrowth depends upon rain, and so varies from year to year. During the\r\nwarmer months, from June to September, the local Caribou seemed to me to\r\nbe feeding very largely on the higher vegetation, such as willow, dwarf\r\nbirch, alder, and sedges. I had no definite evidence of their consuming\r\nlichens during that period. By early October the species of _Cladonia_\r\nseemed to have attained a somewhat fuller growth than they had exhibited\r\nseveral months previously. Perez-Llano discusses (1944: 29-30) the\r\nutilization by Reindeer of various lichens. Dix has reported (1951) on a\r\ncollection of lichens from the Windy River area.\r\n\r\nSome miscellaneous observations along Windy and Little rivers follow:\r\nJune 16, 20 Caribou feeding apparently on patches of crowberry\r\n(_Empetrum_) and dwarf birch (_Betula glandulosa_) on a ridge; June 29,\r\na Caribou feeding apparently on dwarf birches; June 30, a buck grazing\r\nin a sedge bog; August 26, several bucks browsing on willow tops\r\n(probably _Salix planifolia_) in a riverside thicket, and some does on\r\ndwarf birch and perhaps tall grass or low willow; August 27, numbers\r\nfeeding largely on willow and dwarf birch; August 28 and 30, low alders,\r\nwillow, and dwarf birches nibbled off. By early October the leaves of\r\nthe three last-mentioned shrubs were no longer available, having dropped\r\noff. During the summer they had seemed to be preferred above the\r\nlichens. Cabot has remarked (1912: 46) on the fondness of _Rangifer\r\narcticus caboti_ for dwarf birch in Labrador.\r\n\r\nCharles Schweder reported as follows on the food of Caribou. In summer\r\nthey live chiefly upon leaves, especially those of dwarf birch, and to\r\nsome extent upon \"grass\" (probably largely sedges). Toward the last of\r\nJune a Caribou was killed with fat an inch thick on its\r\nhaunches--perhaps the effect of recent feeding on the fresh green\r\nvegetation. In August and September the animals also eat mushrooms and\r\nget very fat on them; they seem to be especially fond of a certain red\r\nkind, which Charles has found in their stomachs. The Eskimos' name for\r\nmushrooms signifies \"deer food.\" The Caribou feed upon dead \"grass\"\r\n(perhaps mostly sedges) in the fall, but not in the winter. Charles has\r\nseen them digging through 4 feet of snow to get at the reindeer lichens;\r\nbut for the most part their winter feeding in this region is on the tops\r\nof the hills, which remain bare. They also eat tree lichens, especially\r\nin the winter time.\r\n\r\nCharles has seen Caribou chew the cud while standing as well as while\r\nlying down. He once saw a buck thus occupied while standing on a hill\r\nfor half a day in a breeze that kept the mosquitoes down.\r\n\r\nAmong the hundreds of Caribou observed at the river crossings and\r\nelsewhere, I do not recall seeing a single one pause to drink.\r\n\r\nThe _Influence of food supply on distribution_ of the Barren Ground\r\nCaribou has been discussed in a previous section.\r\n\r\n  _References._--Hearne, 1795: 317; Franklin, 1823: 242;\r\n  Richardson, \"1825\": 329, and 1829: 243; Godman, 1831, +2+: 284;\r\n  Richardson, in Back, 1836: 498, and 1861: 275; Murray, 1858:\r\n  202; B. R.

They are quite unlike the\r\noblong, curvilinear, comparatively symmetrical scats of the White-tailed\r\nDeer and the Moose. I did not observe, nor learn of, any particular\r\nseasonal variation in the shape or other characters.\r\n\r\n  _References._--Sutton and Hamilton, 1932: 81; Manning, 1943a:\r\n  50.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Voice_\r\n\r\nMy impression of the adult Caribou is that it is a comparatively silent\r\nanimal during most of the year. At the rutting season, however, when the\r\nbucks do their fighting with a clash of antlers, their voice is heard,\r\nas Fred Schweder, Jr., informed me. It is about as loud as the fawn's\r\ngrunt, but a different sort of sound. Fred has also known a doe to call\r\nwhen its fawn was shot.\r\n\r\nThe only vocal sound that I heard from the Caribou was the grunt or\r\nbawling of the fawns on the fall migration, and only during the last\r\nweek of August, when the \"big movement\" was under way. It was uttered\r\nchiefly at the river crossings, apparently as a result of the fawns'\r\nanxiety lest they be separated from their mothers during the slight\r\nuncertainty or confusion of these passages, when a considerable number\r\nof animals were participating. It seemed to be a fair equivalent of a\r\nhuman child's crying out: \"Don't leave me behind!\" or \"Where are you,\r\nmamma?\" The grunt is very different from the bleating of a lamb or the\r\nbawling of a domestic calf. It is a surprisingly raucous or guttural,\r\nalmost explosive, yet not very loud note, which I rendered at various\r\ntimes as _gwuf_, _goff_, _gowk_, or _gorr_. Perhaps the last rendering\r\ncomes nearest to the actual sound. With one or two exceptions, I did not\r\nidentify any individual uttering one of these grunts; but the Schweder\r\nboys, from their intimate knowledge of the species, assured me that this\r\nwas the voice of the fawn. In one case the sound came rather definitely\r\nfrom a fawn that had become somewhat separated from its band in going up\r\nthe adjacent ridge after crossing Little River. But for the most part\r\nthe grunts seemed to come from swimming animals.\r\n\r\nOn August 30 another sort of sound--probably not a vocal one--seemed to\r\ncome from one of the older animals among a large band crossing Little\r\nRiver. It was probably produced by a vigorous vibration of the nostrils.\r\nIt is further discussed in the section on _Shaking off moisture and\r\ninsects_.\r\n\r\nIt is rather astonishing that Seton, after seeing and studying many\r\nCaribou at close range in Mackenzie, should say no more about their\r\nvoice than: \"They snort a good deal and grunt a little\" (1911: 210). In\r\nhis later monographic account he practically ignores the topic, merely\r\nreferring to the animals' \"sniffing, snorting\" (1929, 3: 105).\r\n\r\n  _References._--Lyon, 1824: 336; Pike, 1917 (1892): 89; Stone and\r\n  Cram, 1904: 53; Seton, 1911: 210, and 1929, +3+: 105; Hornaday,\r\n  1914, +2+: 103; Critchell-Bullock, 1930: 193; Sutton and\r\n  Hamilton, 1932: 84; Murie, 1939: 245; Downes, 1943: 226,\r\n  256-257; Harper, 1949: 230; Banfield, 1951a: 22.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Reproduction_\r\n\r\nBy the time the rutting season arrived in mid-October, there were\r\ncomparatively few Caribou left in the Windy River area. Consequently my\r\ninformation on the subject was derived mainly from Charles Schweder and\r\nFred Schweder, Jr. Weeks before the scheduled season, there were certain\r\nmanifestations of the sexual urge. For example, on September 5 about 20\r\nCaribou were passing the Bear Slough. The band consisted mostly of does\r\nand fawns, but included several middle-aged bucks (with antlers much\r\nless than the maximum size) and possibly some younger bucks. Twice I saw\r\none of the animals attempt to cover another, but driving rain and the\r\ncompactness of the band prevented me from determining the sex or age of\r\nthose involved. During a trip to the Kazan River, lasting from September\r\n17 to October 1, Fred observed a good deal of fighting among the\r\nCaribou--obviously a prelude to the mating season. In Charles' opinion,\r\nthese early contests are not very much in earnest; the real fighting\r\nbegins about October 15. On October 8 Charles and Fred referred to\r\nfighting that was going on among a herd of about 100 between Glacier\r\nPond and Lake Charles. Perhaps less than a quarter of this herd were\r\nolder bucks; the rest, younger bucks, does, and fawns.\r\n\r\nIn former years, while living at the \"Old Post\" on Red River, Charles\r\nused to go out and watch the fighting on a big open muskeg, about a mile\r\nsquare, where the Caribou would congregate practically every year at the\r\nrutting season, up to a thousand strong. They would stay for three or\r\nfour days, then disappear. Nothing on the same scale had come to his\r\nnotice in the vicinity of the Windy River post. At this season, when the\r\nanimals are in large herds, the bucks utter their calls, as mentioned in\r\nthe section on _Voice_. According to Fred, one sees in October a good\r\nmany bucks with an antler broken off in the fighting. The break\r\ngenerally occurs at about the middle of the antler. On September 29\r\nCharles reported a buck with a broken antler, which he interpreted as\r\nevidence of the beginning of the fighting season. During the rutting\r\nseason he once shot a buck with a broken jaw, and another with an eye\r\ngone. The possible inference was that these injuries had been sustained\r\nin fighting. A buck secured on October 16 had apparently been wounded in\r\nfighting; there was pus in its neck, and it was considered unfit for\r\neating. I heard nothing as to the possible use of hoofs in contests\r\nbetween bucks, as reported by Jacobi (1931: 233) for the Reindeer.\r\n\r\nDuring the rutting season the herd is likely to be a large one, and to\r\ndo little traveling. It is composed of fawns as well as adults. The\r\nbucks pursue the does, and sometimes chase each other. Charles thinks\r\nthe young bucks keep away from the does at this time, being unable to\r\nfight the older bucks with larger antlers. Fred reports a proportion of\r\nabout 10 bucks to 50 does in these herds--a probable indication of\r\npolygamy. He expressed the opinion that the bucks do not mate until 8-10\r\nyears old, and the does not until about four years old. However, he was\r\nbasing his estimate of the age on the total number of points on the\r\nantlers--one point for each year; and on this basis the age was probably\r\nmuch overestimated. Earlier sexual maturity on the part of the doe might\r\nbe another indication of polygamy in the species.\r\n\r\nAt the onset of this season, the bucks neglect their feeding to some\r\nextent; consequently those killed have stomachs only partly filled,\r\ninstead of completely filled, as at other times. By mid-October their\r\nfat becomes tinted with reddish, and the whole flesh becomes so rank and\r\nmusky that it is disdained not only by human beings but even by the\r\nWolves. This condition seems to be considerably more pronounced in the\r\nCaribou than in the White-tailed Deer. The hunters forego eating the old\r\nbucks for a period of several weeks. Meanwhile the younger bucks, not\r\nengaged in mating, remain fit to eat. Hearne (1795: 69) reported the\r\nflesh of bucks as still unpalatable as late as December 30.\r\n\r\nThe rutting season is said to continue through October into November.\r\nThe end of the period is uncertain, but it may coincide with the\r\nshedding of the antlers of the old bucks.\r\n\r\n  _References._--Hearne, 1795: 72, 198-199; Richardson, \"1825\":\r\n  327-328, 1829: 243, and 1861: 274; Pike, 1917 (1892): 48, 90;\r\n  J. W.

Although the migration at Nueltin Lake continues\r\nthroughout June, the rearguard is composed largely of bucks, and the\r\ncomparatively few does accompanying them toward the last may be barren.\r\nFisher (1821: 199) and Parry (1821: 183) report a small fawn of _R.\r\npearyi_ on Melville Island on June 2. Richardson states (\"1825\": 329)\r\nthat the young are born in May and June. There is evidently some\r\ngeographical and individual variation in the time of birth (_cf._\r\nJacobi, 1931: 232). Apparently the gestation period in the Caribou\r\ncovers approximately eight months or a little less. In the domesticated\r\nReindeer it is 231 to 242 days, according to Jacobi (1931: 234); in the\r\nWhite-tailed Deer, 205 to 212 days, according to Seton (1929, +3+: 258).\r\n\r\nFred Schweder, Jr., stated that he had never found more than a single\r\nunborn fawn in any one of the animals he had secured; yet he has seen as\r\nmany as four fawns following a doe. Of course there is no proof that\r\nthis individual was the actual mother of so many fawns; a stray or\r\nbereaved youngster might well endeavor to attach itself to a foster\r\nmother. On August 28, at Little River, I saw a doe being followed by two\r\nfawns. On September 16 Fred reported seeing three old does without\r\nfawns. Presumably most of the does do not bear young until they are two\r\nyears old (_cf._ Jacobi, 1931: 235); thus many yearling does without\r\nfamily cares should be observed during the summer.\r\n\r\nOn September 12 Charles Schweder stated that the does would soon be\r\nlosing their milk; yet on occasion he has found them with milk as late\r\nas November (_cf._ Jacobi, 1931: 235). On September 21, when he secured\r\na doe (fig. 21) that was accompanied by a fawn, I asked if he thought\r\nthe latter was still nursing. By way of answer, he squeezed a couple of\r\nthe doe's mammae, and some milk exuded. Thus the mammary glands were\r\nstill functioning at that date; they appeared well developed. By August\r\n27, at an age of perhaps two and a half months, the fawns were browsing\r\non their own account, and their teeth were well developed. Fred\r\nSchweder, Jr., then spoke of having seen fawns nursing four times during\r\nthat month, the last occasion having been on the 25th. On the 27th I had\r\nthe rare privilege of witnessing such a nursery rite across the mouth of\r\nLittle River. The wilderness baby was so large that it was obliged to\r\nlower its forequarters very decidedly in order to reach the maternal\r\nfont (from a lateral position). This attitude left its hind quarters\r\nthrust high and ludicrously into the air. I did not notice that it\r\nwriggled its tail as a bovine calf might have; but Charles Schweder\r\nspoke of having seen a fawn hold its tail erect while nursing. He also\r\nsaid that the bigger fawns kneel down with their front legs while so\r\nengaged. In his opinion, when a doe is killed in the autumn, its fawn\r\ndoes not go and join other Caribou, but lingers near the fatal spot\r\nuntil a Wolf or some other enemy overcomes it. For this reason it is his\r\npractice to secure the fawn also, if possible, when he takes the mother.\r\nOn September 13 a fawn remained by its dead mother, permitting one of\r\nthe hunters to approach within 30 feet and to throw rocks at it three\r\ntimes, finally taking it by that means. After a doe was killed on\r\nSeptember 21, its fawn lingered in the vicinity for a day or two.\r\n\r\n  _References._--Franklin, 1823: 242; Richardson, \"1825\": 329;\r\n  John Ross, 1835a: 432; Simpson, 1843: 277, 281, 381; J.\r\n  McLean, 1932 (1849): 359; Armstrong, 1857: 477-478; Murray,\r\n  1858: 202; Osborn, 1865: 227; Nourse, 1884: 264-265; Pike, 1917\r\n  (1892): 204, 209; Dowling, 1893: 107: Russell, 1895: 51; R. M.\r\n  Anderson, 1913b: 504-505; Hewitt, 1921: 62; Blanchet, 1926b: 47;\r\n  Seton, 1929, +3+: 124-125; Blanchet, 1930: 49, 53;\r\n  Critchell-Bullock, 1930: 192, 193; Sutton and Hamilton, 1932:\r\n  86; Ingstad, 1933: 161; Clarke, 1940: 88-90; Gavin, 1945: 228;\r\n  Banfield, 1951a: 26, 27; Scott, 1951: 179, 180; Barnett, 1954:\r\n  96.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Growth_\r\n\r\nDuring late August and early September the fawns probably averaged about\r\n50 lb. in weight. (For the measurements of two specimens, see the\r\nsection on _Measurements_.) Yet they varied so much in size that some\r\nappeared nearly twice as big as others. On September 7 an exceptionally\r\nsmall fawn was secured (estimated weight, 35 lb.) (fig. 23). Its coat\r\nwas soft and woolly, representing an earlier stage than that seen in any\r\nof the other fawns of that season. It was molting into the next pelage,\r\nand its hide was unprime. It must have been born at an unusually late\r\ndate. Fred Schweder, Jr., remarked that he sometimes sees this stage in\r\nthe growth of fawns when the Caribou come down early from the north\r\n(about the first of August), but it seems remarkable that it should have\r\nbeen found in a September fawn. The present specimen has actually\r\nsmaller measurements than one secured on August 2 at Artillery Lake\r\n(Seton, 1929, +3+: 97). The collector reported that the parent doe\r\nappeared of ordinary size--not a particularly small or young one. The\r\nyearlings noted on the spring migration in May (south of Churchill) and\r\nin June (at Nueltin Lake) appeared roughly half the size of the adults.\r\n\r\nEvidently several years are required for the attainment of full growth.\r\nThe younger adult bucks, with smaller antlers, are appreciably inferior\r\nin body size to the older bucks, with better developed antlers.\r\n\r\n  _References._--Seton, 1929, +3+: 97, 98; Banfield, 1951a: 30.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Antlers_\r\n\r\nIn late August and early September antlers were already in evidence on\r\nthe fawns, at an age of less than three months. They consisted of bony\r\nknobs, covered with skin, and were an inch or two long. I obtained no\r\ninformation as to when the fawns may shed the velvet or the antlers\r\nthemselves. By analogy with the Reindeer (_cf._ Jacobi, 1931: 237), the\r\nfawns might be expected to drop their antlers in late winter.\r\n\r\nWhen the adult Caribou return from the north in August, the antlers of\r\nall are still in the velvet. However, completely hornless does are not\r\nparticularly uncommon at this season; in Charles Schweder's opinion,\r\nsome remain permanently in that condition. Hornless does are reported in\r\nvarious forms of Caribou or Reindeer in both hemispheres (Jacobi, 1931:\r\n48). I saw also a few one-horned does on the autumn migration. In a\r\nsingle group of three adult does photographed at close range on August\r\n28, one was hornless and another one-horned (fig. 11). A considerable\r\nproportion of my other photographs of Caribou groups at this season show\r\none or more animals with a single antler or none. The hornless condition\r\nappears to be astonishingly more common in Keewatin than in regions\r\nfarther west. Stefánsson, whose field operations were chiefly in\r\nnorthern Mackenzie and southwestern Franklin, remarks (1913b: 151) on\r\nhaving found, at any season when Caribou are normally horned, just three\r\nhornless animals among a thousand at whose killing he had been present.\r\nMurie (1935: 20) speaks of having observed only one hornless doe in\r\nAlaska, in September.\r\n\r\nBy late August the bucks' antlers have attained nearly their full\r\ngrowth, though still in the velvet. The largest head of the season was\r\nobtained on August 22. Its measurements were: right antler, in straight\r\nline from base to tip of longest prong, 995; left antler, 980; distance\r\nbetween main tips of the two antlers, 620; brow tine, from base to upper\r\ntip, 335; to lower tip, 290. For the older bucks, the principal period\r\nfor shedding the velvet is September 10 to 20, although Charles Schweder\r\nonce observed a buck that had completed the process by September 1, and\r\nFred secured one in that condition on September 6, 1947. In Alaska old\r\nbucks shed the velvet more or less regularly in September (Murie, 1935:\r\n26). Sick or wounded animals are said to retain the velvet for an\r\nindefinite period. For example, a buck secured on September 29 had some\r\nvelvet hanging in shreds from the tips of its antlers, and it was found\r\nto have been shot in the mouth sometime previously. The younger bucks\r\nand the does lose their velvet somewhat later than the older bucks (say\r\ntoward the end of September). In a doe of September 21 (fig. 21) the\r\nantlers were covered with velvet and still had soft tips. A young buck\r\nof October 2 was just shedding the velvet.\r\n\r\nCharles Schweder spoke of noting as many as 30-33 points on the antlers\r\nof old bucks. (He probably included the brow and the bez tines in this\r\ncount.) He also referred to an exceptional set of antlers at Simons'\r\nLake with about 40 points; he had first noted it about 10 years\r\npreviously, and it had doubtless been there for years before that. He\r\nhad never been able to secure its equal. When I saw and photographed it\r\nin October (fig. 25), some of the points were broken off, so that an\r\naccurate count was impossible; but there must have been close to 40\r\noriginally, even without the brow tines, which were missing. The\r\npalmation was much broader than I have seen in any other Caribou.\r\n\r\nThe prong projecting backward at the angle of the main beam is by no\r\nmeans so uncommon in the animals of this region as a Chipewyan hunter\r\nseemed to indicate to Downes (1943: 227-228).\r\n\r\nCharles Schweder found a pair of locked antlers about 1940 near Josie's\r\nBay. This was the only case of which he had any knowledge. An instance\r\nof locked antlers in _Rangifer pearyi_ is mentioned by Peary (1907: 84).\r\n\r\nThere is marked variation in the dates of shedding the antlers,\r\naccording to sex, age, and physiological condition of the individual.\r\nThis has resulted in various conflicting statements in the literature.\r\nIn the present region, the old bucks with 25 or more points are said to\r\nshed their antlers about the end of October or in November, at the close\r\nof the rutting season. (Fred Schweder, Jr., encountered a hornless buck\r\nas early as November 7, 1947.) The younger bucks, with 15 to 20 points,\r\nand the does retain their antlers till late May or June of the following\r\nyear. A doe of June 3 and another of June 16 were still horned. In\r\nAlaska \"the young bucks may carry their old antlers until late in April,\r\nwhile does carry theirs until the middle of May, some of them until\r\nJune\" (Murie, 1935: 26).\r\n\r\nJohn Ingebrigtsen reported having seen two or three shallow lakes,\r\nbetween Churchill and (South?) Knife Lake, whose bottoms were fairly\r\ncovered with caribou antlers. They were visible through clear ice. It\r\nappears probable that these lakes, while ice-covered, were favored\r\nresorts of large numbers of Caribou for their midday or nocturnal rests\r\nat a period when they were shedding their antlers (November for the old\r\nbucks, May or June for the does and young bucks).\r\n\r\nIt is natural that the season at which the new antlers of the Barren\r\nGround Caribou begin to grow should vary greatly according to sex and\r\nage, just as the shedding of the antlers does; probably also, for the\r\nvarious forms of _Rangifer_, according to locality (_cf._ Jacobi, 1931:\r\n237). On Southampton Island \"the new antlers begin to appear in the\r\nmales in March and April\" (Sutton and Hamilton, 1932: 85). In Alaska\r\nMurie (1935: 24) \"has found old bucks late in April with velvet knobs\r\nwell begun.\" Seton's account (1929, +3+: 102-103) of the seasonal change\r\nof antlers is not only meager but largely at variance with the\r\ninformation I assembled in Keewatin. Recently gathered information is\r\nsupplied by Banfield (1951a: 17-18).\r\n\r\nMeasurements of the length of antlers in the velvet (right and left,\r\nrespectively) were recorded as follows: adult male, June 18, 420, 440;\r\nadult male (figs. 3, 4), August 17, 1165, 1205; adult female (fig. 21),\r\nSeptember 21, 220, 165.\r\n\r\nScratching or anointing of antlers in the velvet with a hind hoof was\r\nobserved in an adult buck on June 16, and in a fawn on August 27.\r\n\r\nWhile there is undoubtedly some correlation between the age of a Caribou\r\nand the number of points on its antlers, I am not aware that such a\r\ncorrelation has been worked out to a satisfactory degree. The Schweder\r\nbrothers judged a Caribou's years by the number of points on both\r\nantlers, yet freely admitted that they had limited confidence in such a\r\ncriterion. Probably they would be nearer the actual facts if they\r\ncounted the points on only one antler. The situation is complicated by\r\nthe fact (if we are to credit Jacobi, 1931: 238) that bucks in other\r\nforms of _Rangifer_ exhibit the best development of antlers at six to\r\neight years.\r\n\r\n  _References._--Hearne, 1795: 198-199; Franklin, 1823: 240-241;\r\n  Lyon, 1824: 270; Richardson, \"1825\": 327-328, and 1829: 241;\r\n  Richardson, in Back, 1836: 499; Armstrong, 1857: 478; Murray,\r\n  1858: 199-206; B. R.

The bucks hasten the\r\nshedding of the velvet in the autumn by rubbing their antlers on various\r\ntrees--willow, spruce, or tamarack. The individual may complete the\r\noperation in possibly half a day. It is thought, however, that most of\r\nthe velvet comes off at the first tree. The animals usually select a\r\ntree standing by itself rather than one in a thicket. It is usually a\r\nsmall tree--say 4 feet high and 1 inch in diameter. Perhaps a spruce is\r\nmost often selected. Branches are broken and much of the bark is scraped\r\noff in the process. The velvet soon dries up, so that it is little\r\nnoticed. Charles did not recall having seen any hanging in a tree.\r\n\r\nThe numbers of rubbing trees that I noticed at Simons' Lake in\r\nmid-October indicated that Caribou must have been much more numerous\r\nthere during the previous month than in the vicinity of the Windy River\r\npost. These trees were particularly in evidence on the outskirts of a\r\nspruce and tamarack thicket at the head of the lake. They were mostly\r\ntamaracks, with some black spruces. Of the two spruces shown in figure\r\n26, the larger was about 4 feet high. Many of the young trees had been\r\nkilled. The branches and the tops had been pretty generally broken off\r\nand were lying on the ground. Most of the damage was fresh, but some of\r\nit dated from previous years.\r\n\r\n  _Reference._--Hanbury, 1904: 232.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMORPHOLOGY AND TAXONOMY\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pelage and molt_\r\n\r\nWhen the Caribou migrate northward through the Nueltin Lake region in\r\nMay and June, they still retain their winter pelage. It is now worn and\r\nfaded, and harsh as well, in contrast to the fresh, dark, soft autumn\r\ncoat.\r\n\r\nThis stage is represented by an adult buck (No. 1046) of June 18. The\r\ngeneral color above is Cream-Buff (capitalized color terms are derived\r\nfrom Ridgway, 1912), changing gradually to Isabella Color on sides of\r\nhead and body; no distinct dark longitudinal stripe on lower sides (such\r\nas appears in summer and autumn pelage); tail Cream-Buff above, the rest\r\nCartridge Buff; rump-patch varying from Cartridge Buff to Cream-Buff;\r\ntip of snout and chin dirty whitish; small area below nostrils near\r\nMummy Brown; triangular area behind nostrils Cream-Buff; crown Cartridge\r\nBuff; ears Olive-Buff on outer surface, Cartridge Buff on inner surface;\r\nposterior venter Cartridge Buff; legs Isabella Color in front, remainder\r\nCream-Buff; hoofs black, bordered above with Cartridge Buff hairs,\r\nforming a band ½-2 inches in width; antler velvet in this and other\r\nspecimens Olive-Brown. The marked difference between the dark brownish\r\nand white pelage of the autumn and the Cream-Buff coat of early June\r\npresumably results from wear and fading, without molt. The does and the\r\nyearlings in June appear grayer than the adult bucks.\r\n\r\nIn another adult male (No. 1033), collected June 3, the darker part of\r\nthe pelage is Buffy Brown rather than Cream-Buff.\r\n\r\nThe molt of the bucks begins in June but takes place chiefly in July,\r\nwhile the animals are somewhere to the north of the Nueltin Lake region.\r\nOn their return in August they have largely completed their summer\r\ntransformation in appearance. A buck of August 17 had just a little of\r\nthe winter fur still clinging to its lower back; and another on August\r\n20 was in similar condition. At this season the white mane is developed\r\nonly on its lower portion (figs. 9, 10, 12), but by the end of September\r\nthe white has spread upward over practically the whole neck (fig. 22),\r\nand in some cases over the shoulders.\r\n\r\nIn an adult male (No. 1144) of October 16, representing the pelage of\r\nthe rutting season, the posterior crown is near Tilleul Buff, the\r\nanterior crown somewhat browner; sides of head and upper throat between\r\nVerona Brown and Buffy Brown; area about and between eyes somewhat\r\ndarker; triangular area behind nostrils (apex extending halfway to eyes)\r\nand lower chin between Mummy Brown and Warm Blackish Brown; tip of snout\r\nand chin Cartridge Buff; ears pale creamy white on both surfaces; whole\r\nneck and shoulder mantle whitish, washed with Cartridge Buff, and\r\nchanging gradually to the brownish of the sides of the head; long hairs\r\nalong median ventral line of the neck tipped with Natal Brown; dorsal\r\narea, from shoulders to rump, Prout's Brown; stripe on lower sides Mummy\r\nBrown, separated from dorsal area by an ill-defined lighter stripe,\r\nmixed with whitish hairs; top of tail slightly paler than back, the rest\r\nwhite; small rump-patch mostly white; chest Mummy Brown; mid-venter\r\nvarying from Deep Olive-Buff anteriorly to Cream-Buff posteriorly;\r\nposterior venter white; forelegs near Bone Brown; hind legs between\r\nMummy Brown and Olive-Brown, with a pale spot on the inner side of the\r\nheel (this spot noticeable also in doe and fawn); hoofs black, bordered\r\nabove with whitish hairs. The hides of this specimen and of two other\r\nadult bucks (No. 1111, September 29, and No. 1132, October 16) were\r\nprime. The dark lateral stripe, which shows quite distinctly in summer\r\nand fall specimens of both sexes (figs. 7, 8, 10, 21, 22), from fawns\r\n(except very young ones) to adults, and which is also a prominent\r\nfeature in Old World Reindeer (_cf._ Flerov, 1933), has been largely or\r\nwholly overlooked in some descriptions of _Rangifer a. arcticus_.\r\n\r\nThe summer molt occurs later in the does than in the bucks. Some of the\r\nformer return toward the end of August while still retaining most of the\r\nwinter pelage. Others exhibit remnants of it in patches, especially on\r\nthe lower back; this was true even of an adult doe (No. 1101) secured as\r\nlate as September 21 (fig. 21). Its hide, however, was prime. In this\r\nspecimen the crown is near Verona Brown, with varying admixture of\r\nwhitish hairs; sides of head Verona Brown; upper throat a little paler;\r\na poorly defined area behind nostrils, and lower chin, Mummy Brown; tip\r\nof snout and chin Cartridge Buff; ears Drab, varying to Pale Olive-Buff,\r\nespecially on inner surface; neck Drab dorsally, mixed with whitish\r\nhairs, the remainder Pale Olive-Buff; dorsal area, from shoulder to\r\nrump, Mars Brown; lateral stripe on lower sides Mars Brown, separated\r\nfrom dorsal area by a poorly defined but conspicuous area of Light\r\nCinnamon-Drab; top of tail like back, the rest whitish, washed laterally\r\nwith Pale Pinkish Buff; small rump-patch mostly white; chest Mummy\r\nBrown; venter Light Drab, becoming whitish in inguinal region; forelegs\r\nNatal Brown, slightly darker in front; hind legs Natal Brown, with a\r\npale spot on the inner edge of the heel; hoofs black, bordered above\r\nwith whitish \"spats\" varying from ½ to 1½ inches in width.\r\n\r\nAnother doe, secured on November 3 but not preserved, was apparently in\r\nlong, full winter pelage, with whitish mane and shoulders. The dorsum\r\ngenerally was grayish; the top of the rump, buffy gray. The white\r\nrump-patch appeared to be more extensive, and to contain longer hairs,\r\nthan in the doe of September 21; likewise the white \"spats\" appeared\r\nmuch more extensive.\r\n\r\nAs winter comes on, the fur of the Caribou grows longer and paler gray.\r\nOne incipient stage of such a change from the summer coat began to be\r\nnoticeable as early as September 13. A buck that came trotting down out\r\nof the Windy Hills on September 27 revealed the splendor of its new\r\nwinter coat, with an amazing amount of creamy white, chiefly on the mane\r\nand shoulders. The long mane wears off during the winter, according to\r\nCharles Schweder. It looks best, he added, when the bucks start to fight\r\nin the fall. A yearling or large fawn on October 21 was distinctly\r\ncreamy about the neck and shoulders. After describing a winter female\r\nfrom Wager River, Seton remarks (1929, +3+: 98): \"The general impression\r\nis of a creamy white animal, with a gray blanket on its back.\"\r\n\r\nFor the first couple of months of its life the fawn wears a soft and\r\nwoolly coat. An example was furnished by a male fawn (No. 1095; fig. 23)\r\nof September 7, which must have been born several weeks later than the\r\naverage date. It was actually smaller and less developed than another\r\nmale fawn collected on August 20. It was molting into the next pelage\r\n(described in the following paragraph), and its hide was unprime. The\r\ngeneral color is Deep Brownish Drab; this is overlaid with longer hairs\r\nof Pale Olive-Buff on the median dorsal line of the neck, on the venter,\r\nand on part of the legs; a median stripe on the back near Hay's Brown;\r\nno distinct lateral stripe; ears and posterior crown Cartridge Buff;\r\nforepart of crown Deep Brownish Drab; area above eye Cream-Buff; snout\r\nvarying from Deep Brownish Drab above to Pale Gull Gray on sides;\r\ntransverse band behind nostrils Dusky Brown; tip of snout whitish; tail\r\nDeep Brownish Drab above, pale creamy on sides, and white beneath;\r\nrump-patch whitish; chin anteriorly whitish, posteriorly Dusky Drab;\r\nthroat whitish to Pale Gull Gray; lower part of legs, in front, Buffy\r\nBrown; hoofs black, bordered above with a very narrow (¼-inch) strip of\r\nwhitish hairs. A very similar young fawn, taken on August 2, 1907, has\r\nbeen described by Seton (1929, +3+: 98).\r\n\r\nIn a male fawn (No. 1072) collected on August 20 the general color is\r\nbetween Olive-Brown and Natal Brown; a paler longitudinal area\r\nseparating the lateral stripe from the dorsal area; ears Clove Brown\r\nexternally, pale creamy internally; transverse band behind nostrils\r\nBlackish Brown; tip of snout whitish; sides of head varying from\r\nCream-Buff above eyes to Cartridge Buff below; tail Bone Brown above,\r\nwhite below; rump-patch whitish; legs Buffy Brown, darker in front; chin\r\nanteriorly whitish, posteriorly Hair Brown; throat Cartridge Buff;\r\nventer Light Drab; hoofs black, bordered above with a narrow (¼- to\r\n½-inch) strip of whitish hairs.\r\n\r\n  _References._--Franklin, 1823: 240-241; Richardson, 1829: 242;\r\n  B. R.

There are references to albinos by the following authors:\r\nRussell (1895: 51; 1898: 91, 226), Whitney (1896: 237), Boas (1901: 150,\r\n501), MacFarlane (1905: 682-683), Ingstad (1933: 312), and Degerbøl\r\n(1935: 49, 51).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Foot-glands_\r\n\r\nI dissected out the glands from the hind feet of an adult male Caribou\r\n(No. 1046). Seton (1929, +3+: 68) has discussed these structures in the\r\nWoodland Caribou and the Norwegian Reindeer; and Pocock (1911: 960-962,\r\nfig. 138B) and Jacobi (1931: 22, fig. 4), in the Reindeer. Many hairs\r\nhad their base in the glands, and there was a fatty secretion on the\r\nhairs adjacent to the glands. I judged that the opening to the exterior\r\nextended in a more or less dorso-anterior direction. One of the\r\nsuggested functions of these glands is anointing the velvet covering of\r\nthe antlers. I was highly interested, therefore, in seeing an old buck\r\non June 16 rub the tips of its growing antlers with each hind foot in\r\nturn. Meanwhile it inclined its antlers alternately to one side and\r\nbackwards to place one of them at a time within convenient reach of the\r\nhind foot on that side. It seemed to rub its snout as well as the antler\r\ntips. In Charles Schweder's experience this action was always carried\r\nout with the hind foot, not the forefoot. The latter contains a similar\r\nbut smaller gland, according to Jacobi (1931: 22), while Pocock (1911:\r\n960-961) gives contrary testimony. On August 27 I also saw a fawn\r\nrubbing a knob of its skin-covered antlers with a hind foot.\r\n\r\nAnother function of the foot-glands is suggested by an observation of\r\nDugmore's (1913: 89-90), which has been mentioned in the section on\r\n_Signaling_. I could not definitely connect any of the various occasions\r\nof panic that I observed, with scent from the foot-glands of preceding\r\nCaribou that had been frightened.\r\n\r\n  _References._--Caton, 1881: 265; Pocock, 1911: 960-962; Seton,\r\n  1929, +3+: 68, 105; Sutton and Hamilton, 1932: 84; Harper, 1949:\r\n  230.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mastology_\r\n\r\nVery little seems to have been published on this subject. Jacobi (1931:\r\n24) merely remarks that in the Reindeer the mammae number four, or\r\noccasionally six, but that the supernumerary ones are not functional.\r\nThe four rudimentary mammae in a male fawn of _arcticus_ (No. 1072) of\r\nAugust 20 seemed remarkable for their arrangement in a nearly straight\r\ntransverse row--quite different from the more rectangular pattern in a\r\ndomestic Cow or in a male Moose, as figured by Seton (1929, +3+: 221).\r\nIn an adult doe (No. 1101) of September 21 the anterior pair are about\r\ntwice as far apart as the posterior pair; each of the mammae appears no\r\nmore than a couple of inches from the one nearest to it. The arrangement\r\nin a two-year-old buck, as shown by Seton (1929, +3+: 106), is\r\napproximately intermediate between linear and rectangular.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fat_\r\n\r\nA Caribou (probably a buck) secured about the end of June was reported\r\nto have back fat half an inch thick--possibly resulting from the fresh\r\ngreen spring feed. In August, however, scarcely any fat was to be found\r\non the animals; perhaps the annual renewal of pelage and the summer\r\nharassment by flies had been deterrents to the storage of fat. In\r\nSeptember and early October the Caribou were in prime condition. On\r\nSeptember 19 there was a fresh piece of back fat half an inch thick; two\r\ndays later there was another piece three times as thick. In 1943 (a year\r\nof great mushroom growth) the animals were said to have become\r\nparticularly fat. According to Charles Schweder, the doe never becomes\r\nso fat as the buck; one of September 21, still nursing, was just\r\nslightly fat. An adult buck of September 29 was recorded as \"somewhat\r\nfat\"; two of October 16 were \"rather fat\" and \"quite fat.\" Charles has\r\nseen as much as 3 inches of fat on a buck. The strips of back fat\r\nbrought into camp on October 8 from several bucks weighed about 5 to 10\r\nlb. apiece. Such fatness evidently prepares the bucks for the strain of\r\nthe rutting season, when they neglect their feeding and become very poor\r\nand thin. This loss of fat occurs in about two weeks. The does also lose\r\nsome fat at this season, but slowly. In some winters the Caribou remain\r\nfat, but in other winters they do not. In the latter case there may be\r\ndeep snow that hinders their feeding. In the spring the Caribou become\r\nfat again, and they are in that condition when they arrive from the\r\nsouth in May.\r\n\r\nThe eagerness of the Eskimos and the Indians for fat results in their\r\nselection of the biggest bucks, which generally carry the most fat.\r\nCharles Schweder spoke of the tail of such an animal almost\r\ndisappearing, apparently engulfed in fat! Besides its use in the native\r\ndiet, the fat goes into the making of \"Eskimo candles\" (see section on\r\n_Relations to man_).\r\n\r\n  _References._--Franklin, 1823: 240; Armstrong, 1857: 477-478;\r\n  Whitney, 1896: 161; Elliot, 1902: 276; R. M.

Final judgment on the significance of this variation must\r\nawait the accumulation of more and better material. The lack of\r\ntopotypical material from the Fort Enterprise area, Mackenzie, is a\r\nparticular handicap.\r\n\r\n  The extreme and average body measurements of five adult males\r\n  from the Windy River area (see accompanying table) may be\r\n  compared with those of three adult males, taken by R. M.\r\n  Anderson, 1910 and 1912, at Langton and Darnley Bays (Nos.\r\n  34431, 34432, and 34435, Am. Mus. Nat. Hist.): length, 1980-2095\r\n  (2052); tail (two specimens), 152-165 (158.5); height at\r\n  shoulder, 1066-1167 (1117); shoulder to hip (one specimen), 964.\r\n  The average length of these specimens exceeds that of the Windy\r\n  River specimens by 278 mm.; the average height at the shoulder,\r\n  by 37 mm. The length of an adult male from Artillery Lake (J. A.\r\n  Allen, 1910: 8) exceeds the Windy River average by 156 mm., and\r\n  its shoulder height (Seton, 1929, +3+: 97), by 10 mm., but the\r\n  length of its hind foot, as recorded, is 17 mm. less than the\r\n  Windy River average.\r\n\r\n  The measurements of four adult females, taken by Anderson, 1910\r\n  and 1911, at Langton Bay, Horton River, and Great Bear Lake\r\n  (Nos. 34429, 34434, 34441, 34442, Am. Mus. Nat. Hist.) are:\r\n  length, 1625-1815 (1736); height at shoulder, 825-1066 (968);\r\n  shoulder to hip (one specimen), 863. The average length of these\r\n  specimens exceeds that of a Windy River adult female by 146 mm.;\r\n  the average height at the shoulder, by 98 mm. The length of an\r\n  adult female from Aylmer Lake (J. A. Allen, 1910: 8) exceeds\r\n  that of the Windy River specimen by 112 mm.; the length of its\r\n  hind foot, by 18 mm.; and the height at the shoulder (Seton,\r\n  1929, +3+: 97), by 43 mm.\r\n\r\nThus there appears to be a fairly uniform tendency toward greater body\r\nmeasurements from southwestern Keewatin to northwestern Mackenzie. The\r\nweight of Seton's male from Artillery Lake (270¾ lb.) considerably\r\nexceeds the maximum (200 lb.) that I estimated for any of the Windy\r\nRiver males. Maximum measurements are furnished by winter specimens from\r\nthe region of Langton and Darnley Bays.\r\n\r\n  The skulls of two adult males from Horton River and Artillery\r\n  Lake (Nos. 34502 and 29031, Am. Mus. Nat. Hist.) measure,\r\n  respectively: condylobasal length (tip of premaxillary to\r\n  posterior plane of condyles), 381, 371; zygomatic width, 138,\r\n  approximately 142; interorbital width, 143, 144; nasal, 126,\r\n  112; maxillary tooth-row, 87, 84; mandibular tooth-row (of No.\r\n  29031), 93. The rostral profile of the former is slightly\r\n  convex; of the latter nearly flat. Comparison with Windy River\r\n  adult males (see accompanying table) indicates a longer and a\r\n  broader skull in the more northwesterly specimens. The\r\n  measurements of the skulls of Southampton Island specimens as\r\n  presented by Sutton and Hamilton (1932: 87), suggest a somewhat\r\n  larger animal than the mainland form.\r\n\r\n  The left antler of an adult male from Horton River (No. 34502,\r\n  Am. Mus. Nat. Hist.) measures: length, 1248; length of brow\r\n  tine, 345; width of brow tine, 360; total points (both antlers),\r\n  16 + 14 = 30. The corresponding measurements of two sets of\r\n  antlers from Fort Reliance in the American Museum of Natural\r\n  History are: No. 121471 (left), 1242-285-108; (right),\r\n  1244-412-294; total points, 16 + 23 = 39; No. 121473 (left),\r\n  1312-360-290 (broken); (right), 1230 (approx.), brow tine a\r\n  spike, not palmated; total points, approximately 19 + 13 = 32.\r\n  The Fort Reliance specimens were selected by George G. Goodwin\r\n  from a large number of old antlers lying about, and they are\r\n  naturally above the average in size. The antlers of adult males\r\n  from the Windy River area (see accompanying table) measure\r\n  distinctly less than those just mentioned.\r\n\r\nAnderson (1913b: 505) and Stefánsson (1913a: 106, and 1913b: 241,\r\n276-277) have called attention to certain rather well-defined\r\ndifferences between the Caribou on both sides of Coronation Gulf and\r\nthose elsewhere in northern Mackenzie. It may be assumed that the summer\r\nhome of the former type is on Victoria Island. Many of these animals in\r\nformer years crossed over to the mainland in the autumn after the\r\nfreezing of Dolphin and Union Strait, Coronation Gulf, and Dease Strait\r\nmade such a migration possible; and they recrossed to the island in the\r\nspring. During recent years this migration has greatly dwindled\r\n(Blanchet, 1930: 50; Birket-Smith, 1933: 93; Clarke, 1940: 98; Gavin,\r\n1945: 227; Godsell, 1937: 288; Banfield, 1949: 481); consequently the\r\nVictoria Island population now seems to be largely confined to that\r\nisland throughout the year. In the American Museum of Natural History I\r\nhave examined several of Anderson's specimens of 1911-1912 that are\r\nobviously of this form, and I should scarcely hesitate to give them\r\nnomenclatural recognition except for the fact that there has obviously\r\nbeen some confusion in the labeling of the specimens (after they reached\r\nthe museum). Needless to say, a specimen selected as a type should bear\r\nunquestionable data.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter there is some interchange of populations between Banks\r\nand Victoria islands across the frozen Prince of Wales Strait\r\n(Armstrong, 1857: 297, 336). The description that Armstrong gives (1857:\r\n478), based ostensibly on Banks Island specimens, indicates that the\r\nanimals of that island are very close to, if not identical with,\r\n_Rangifer pearyi_ of the more northerly Arctic islands. Yet there is no\r\nknown interchange of populations across the frozen McClure Strait or\r\nother wide sea channels in approximately latitude 74° N.\r\n\r\nThe Caribou of Boothia Peninsula and Somerset and Prince of Wales\r\nislands are said to be a small form (Wright, 1944: 195).\r\n\r\nThe Caribou of the Dubawnt River region, as far as may be judged from\r\nJ. B. Tyrrell's photographs (1897: pl. 1; Seton, 1929, +3+: pl. 22), are\r\nindistinguishable from those of the Nueltin Lake region.\r\n\r\nThe Southampton Island antlers figured by Sutton and Hamilton (1932:\r\npl. 8) are so strikingly different from all but one (No. 1132) of those\r\nthat I noticed in southwestern Keewatin that I should be much inclined\r\nto regard them as representing a separate subspecies, provided they are\r\ntypical of that island. In most of the bucks of the Windy River area the\r\nbeams are deeply and fairly uniformly bowed, although there is a strong\r\ntendency for approximately the basal third to be nearly straight, with a\r\npronounced forward bend just above it (_cf._ figs. 3, 4, 9, 10, 12, 22,\r\n25). The bend at this point in the Southampton antlers is extremely\r\nslight by comparison. In mainland specimens the beam in cross-section\r\nis generally more or less round, with rarely any tendency toward\r\nflattening, such as may be seen in the Southampton set and in my No.\r\n1132. Furthermore, I cannot recall in the mainland animals a single such\r\npronounced zigzag effect as may be seen in the Southampton antlers. In\r\nextremely few of them does the bez tine originate at such a distance\r\n(apparently 8 inches or so) above the base, as in Sutton and Hamilton's\r\nfigure. The lack of palmation in the bez tines of their specimen is\r\nnoteworthy.\r\n\r\nThere is a distinct likelihood that the isolated herd of Coats Island\r\n(Wright, 1944: 188; Banfield, 1949: 481), and also that of Salisbury\r\nIsland in Hudson Strait (Grant, 1903: 189; Tweedsmuir, 1951: 37), may be\r\ndistinct from the populations on the nearest large land bodies.\r\n\r\nI have briefly examined a dozen or more heads (skulls with antlers) of\r\nthe Labrador Barren Ground Caribou (_R. a. caboti_ G. M. Allen) in the\r\nUnited States National Museum; they were collected by L. M. Turner in\r\nthe 1880's. Some of these antlers appear longer than any I saw in\r\nKeewatin. Furthermore, the tips of the bez tines in these specimens\r\nseem, on the average, more strongly incurved than in _R. a. arcticus_.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of comparing the Barren Ground Caribou with the Western\r\nWoodland Caribou, _Rangifer caribou sylvestris_ (Richardson), the\r\nfollowing notes are offered on an adult male of the latter form in the\r\nUnited States Biological Surveys Collection (No. 235361; fig. 28). It\r\nwas secured by a Cree Indian on Stony Mountain, about 27 miles south of\r\nFort McMurray, Alberta, on October 21, 1920, and it was measured and\r\nprepared by myself. The general dorsal color is near Prout's Brown,\r\noverlaid more or less with longer whitish hairs; outer surface of ears\r\nnear Prout's Brown, with an admixture of grayish white hairs; tip of\r\nsnout, between nostrils and upper lip, Cartridge Buff; this area of more\r\nrestricted extent than the similar patch in _arcticus_; neck creamy;\r\nlongest hairs of throat fringe about 20 mm. (longer than in _arcticus_);\r\nno appreciable dark longitudinal stripe on lower sides, but an\r\nill-defined lighter patch on the side behind the shoulder; rump-patch\r\napparently less extensive than in _R. a. arcticus_; venter near Buffy\r\nBrown, posteriorly creamy; creamy white \"spats\" above hoofs ¼ to 1½\r\ninches wide, not extending up hind leg as indicated by Seton (1929, +3+:\r\npl. 10). Length, 2025; tail, 225; foot, 625; front hoof, 109; hind hoof,\r\n101; estimated weight, 300 lb. The Western Woodland Caribou is thus a\r\ndistinctly larger animal than _R. a. arcticus_, with a noteworthy\r\ndifference in the virtual absence of a light lateral stripe, setting off\r\na darker stripe below it. The specific distinctness between the two\r\nanimals seems abundantly clear.\r\n\r\n  _References to general descriptions (including geographical\r\n  variation)._--Richardson, 1829: 239, 241-242; Armstrong, 1857:\r\n  478; Baird, 1857: 635; Caton, 1881: 105; Lydekker, 1898: 47-48,\r\n  1901: 38-40, and 1915: 254; Elliot, 1901: 37, and 1902: 281-282,\r\n  286-287; Preble, 1902: 42-43; Stone and Cram, 1904: 52; J. A.\r\n  Allen, 1908a: 488; Millais, 1915: 261; Buchanan, 1920:\r\n  125-126; Anthony, 1928: 530-531; Seton, 1929, +3+: 98-99;\r\n  Jacobi, 1931: 78-80; Sutton and Hamilton, 1932: 88; Degerbøl,\r\n  1935: 48-51; R. M.

The full citations of the publications (here designated merely\r\nby author and year) may be found in the preceding \"Literature Cited.\"\r\n\r\nThe name or names at the beginning of each entry are those by which the\r\nanimal is referred to in that particular publication. If the author\r\nsupplies a technical name (such as _Rangifer arcticus_), that name alone\r\nis furnished here. The authority for the technical name is included or\r\nomitted according to the usage of each author. If he omits a technical\r\nname, the common name or names he employs (such as \"Caribou\" or\r\n\"Reindeer\") are supplied.\r\n\r\nIn some of the earlier accounts, particularly, more than one form of\r\n_Rangifer_ (_e.g._, Peary's Caribou, the Labrador Caribou, or even the\r\nWoodland Caribou, in addition to the typical Barren Ground Caribou) may\r\nhave been treated under a single designation, such as \"Reindeer\" or\r\n\"_Cervus tarandus_.\" In such case the word \"part\" is added in\r\nparentheses after the name at the beginning of the entry. As far as\r\nis possible or feasible, the references are here limited to _R. a.\r\narcticus_. They constitute a partial summary of the nomenclatural\r\nhistory of the typical subspecies.\r\n\r\nThe annotations aim to provide a sort of abstract of, or unalphabetized\r\nindex to, the treatment of this animal in each publication. Each topic\r\nor rubric of the annotations (such as migration, distribution, food,\r\nvoice, antlers, or relation to Wolves) is accompanied by page\r\nreferences.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier part of the present publication, at the end of the\r\ndiscussion of each topic, references are given (merely by author, year,\r\nand page) to previous literature on the same topic. The Annotated\r\nBibliographical References now supplied represent an amplification of\r\nthose earlier and briefer references--an intermediate stage between\r\nthem and the original literature. It is hoped that they will prove\r\nparticularly helpful to those who may not have ready access to all the\r\nitems of the original literature. My own coverage of the literature has\r\nnot been by any means exhaustive; limitations of time and insufficient\r\naccessibility of some of the rarer publications have been the principal\r\nfactors involved in this deficiency.\r\n\r\nThe chronological arrangement of the entries throws an interesting light\r\non the gradual acquisition, during more than two centuries, of our\r\npresent stock of information on the distribution, taxonomic characters,\r\nlife habits, and general status of _Rangifer arcticus arcticus_. It may\r\nbe remarked, however, that one of the very earliest accounts (Hearne,\r\n1795) was one of the fullest. It contributes toward bringing into focus\r\nthe remarkable attainments of that pioneer explorer-naturalist of the\r\nBarren Grounds.\r\n\r\n  \"Deer\" (one of three kinds): Isham, 1949 (1743): 151\r\n  (description);
