These were\r\ndescribed during the 18th and first half of the 19th centuries by many\r\neminent naturalists, such as J.T. Klein, J.H. Linck, C. Linnaeus, N.G.\r\nLeske, J.S. Miller, L. v. Buch, E. Desor and L. Agassiz; but it was the\r\nresearches of Johannes Muller (1840-1850) that formed the groundwork of\r\nscientific conceptions of the group, proving it one of the great phyla\r\nof the animal kingdom. The anatomists and embryologists of the next\r\nquarter of a century confirmed rather than expanded the views of Muller.\r\nThus, about 1875, the distinction of Echinoderms from such radiate\r\nanimals as jelly-fish and corals (see COELENTERA), by their possession\r\nof a body-cavity (\"coelom\") distinct from the gut, was fully realized;\r\nwhile their severance from the worms (especially Gephyrea), with which\r\nsome Echinoderrns were long confused, had been necessitated by the\r\nrecognition in all of a radial symmetry, impressed on the original\r\nbilateral symmetry of the larva through the growth of a special division\r\nof the coelom, known as the \"hydrocoel,\" and giving rise to a set of\r\nwater-bearing canals--the water-vascular or ambulacral system. There was\r\nalso sufficient comprehension of the differences between the main\r\nclasses of Echinoderms--the sea-urchins or Echinoidea, the starfish or\r\nAsteroidea, the brittle-stars and their allies known as Ophiuroidea, the\r\nworm-like Holothurians, the feather-stars and sea-lilies called\r\nCrinoidea, with their extinct relatives the sac-like Cystidea, the\r\nbud-formed Blastoidea, and the flattened Edrioasteroidea--while within\r\nthe larger of these classes, such as Echinoidea and Crinoidea, fair\r\nworking classifications had been established. But the study that should\r\nelucidate the fundamental similarities or homologies between the several\r\nclasses, and should suggest the relations of the Echinoderma to other\r\nphyla, had scarcely begun. Indeed, the time was not ripe for such\r\ndiscussions, still less for the tracing of lines of descent and their\r\nembodiment in a genealogical classification. Since then exploring\r\nexpeditions have made known a host of new genera, often exhibiting\r\nunfamiliar types of structure.\r\n\r\n  Among these the abyssal starfish and holothurians described by W.P.\r\n  Sladen and H. Theel respectively, in the Report of the \"Challenger\"\r\n  Expedition, are most notable. The sea-urchins, ophiuroids and crinoids\r\n  also have yielded many important novelties to A. Agassiz\r\n  (\"Challenger,\" \"Blake,\" and \"Albatross\" Expeditions), T. Lyman\r\n  (\"Challenger\"), Sladen (\"Astrophiura,\" _Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist._, 1879),\r\n  F.J. Bell (numerous papers in _Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist._ and in _Proc.\r\n  Zool. Soc._), E. Perrier (\"Travailleur\" and \"Talisman,\" Cape Horn and\r\n  Monaco Expeditions), P.H. Carpenter \"Challenger\" Reports), and others.\r\n  The anatomical researches of these authors, as well as those of S.\r\n  Loven (\"On Pourtalesia\" and \"Echinologica,\" published by the Swedish\r\n  Academy of Science), H. Ludwig (_Morphologische Studien_, Leipzig,\r\n  1877-1882), O. Hamann (_Histologie der Echinodermen_, Jena,\r\n  1883-1889), L. Cuenot (\"Etudes morphologiques,\" _Arch. Biol._, 1891,\r\n  and papers therein referred to), P.M. Duncan (\"Revision of the\r\n  Echinoidea,\" _Journ. Linn. Soc._, 1890), H. Prouho (\"Sur Dorocidaris,\"\r\n  _Arch. Zool. Exper._, 1888), and many more, need only be mentioned to\r\n  recall the great advance that has been made. In physiology may be\r\n  instanced W.B. Carpenter's proof of the nervous nature of the\r\n  chambered organ and axial cords of crinoids (_Proc. Roy. Soc._, 1884),\r\n  the researches of H. Durham (_Quart. Journ. Micr. Sci._, 1891) and\r\n  others into the wandering cells of the body-cavity, and the study of\r\n  the deposition of the skeletal substance (\"stereom\") by Theel (in\r\n  _Festskrift for Lilljeborg_, 1896). Knowledge of the development has\r\n  been enormously extended by numerous embryologists, e.g. Ludwig (_op.\r\n  cit._), E.W. MacBride (\"Asterina gibbosa,\" _Quart. Journ. Micr. Sci._,\r\n  1896), H. Bury (_Quart. Journ. Micr. Sci._, 1889, 1895), Seeliger (on\r\n  \"Antedon,\" _Zool. Jahrb._, 1893), S. Goto (\"Asterias pallida,\" _Journ.\r\n  Coll. Sci. Japan_, 1896), C. Grave (\"Ophiura,\" _Mem. Johns Hopkins\r\n  Univ._, 1899), Theel (\"Echinocyamus,\" _Nov. Act. Soc. Sci. Upsala_,\r\n  1892), R. Semon (\"Synapta,\" _Jena. Zeitschr._, 1888), and Loven (_opp.\r\n  citt._); and though the theories based thereon may have been fantastic\r\n  and contradictory, we are now near the time when the results can be\r\n  co-ordinated and some agreement reached. But the scattered details of\r\n  comparative anatomy are capable of manifold arrangement, while the\r\n  palimpsest of individual development is not merely fragmentary, but\r\n  often has the fragments misplaced. The morphologist may propose\r\n  classifications, and the embryologist may erect genealogical trees,\r\n  but all schemes which do not agree with the direct evidence of fossils\r\n  must be abandoned; and it is this evidence, above all, that gained\r\n  enormously in volume and in value during the last quarter of the 19th\r\n  century. The Silurian crinoids and cystids of Sweden have been\r\n  illustrated in N.P. Angelin's _Iconographia crinoideorum_ (1878); the\r\n  Palaeozoic crinoids and cystids of Bohemia are dealt with in J.\r\n  Barrande's _Systeme silurien_ (1887 and 1899); P.H. Carpenter\r\n  published important papers on fossil crinoids in the _Journal_ of the\r\n  Geological Society, on Cystidea in that of the Linnean Society, 1891,\r\n  and, together with R. Etheridge, jun., compiled the large _Catalogue\r\n  of Blastoidea in the British Museum_, 1886; O. Jaekel, in addition to\r\n  valuable studies on crinoids and cystids appearing in the\r\n  _Zeitschrift_ of the German Geological Society, has published the\r\n  first volume of _Die Stammesgeschichte der Pelmatozoen_ (Berlin,\r\n  1899), a richly suggestive work; the Mesozoic Echinoderms of France,\r\n  Switzerland and Portugal have been made known by P. de Loriol, G.H.\r\n  Cotteau, J. Lambert, V. Gauthier and others (see _Paleontologie\r\n  francaise_, _Mem. Soc. paleontol. de la Suisse_, _Trabalhos Comm.\r\n  Geol. Portugal_, &c.); a beautiful and interesting Devonian fauna from\r\n  Bundenbach has been described by O. Follmann, Jaekel, and especially\r\n  B. Sturtz (see _Verhandl. nat. Vereins preuss. Rheinlande, Palaont.\r\n  Abhandl._, and _Palaeontographica_); while the multitude of North\r\n  American palaeozoic crinoids has been attacked by C. Wachsmuth and F.\r\n  Springer in the _Proceedings_ (1879, 1881, 1885, 1886), of the\r\n  Philadelphia Academy and the _Memoirs_ (1897) of the Harvard Museum.\r\n\r\nThe vast mass of material made known by these and many other\r\ndistinguished writers has to be included in our classification, and that\r\nclassification itself must be controlled by the story it reveals. Thus\r\nit is that a change, characteristic of modern systematic zoology, is\r\naffecting the subdivisions of the classes. It is not long since the main\r\nlines of division corresponded roughly to gaps in geological history:\r\nthe orders were Palaeocrinoidea and Neocrinoidea, Palechinoidea and\r\nEuechinoidea, Palaeasteroidea and Euasteroidea, and so forth. Or\r\ndivisions were based upon certain modifications of structure which, as\r\nwe now see, affected assemblages of diverse affinity: thus both\r\nBlastoidea and Euechinoidea were divided into Regularia and Irregularia;\r\nthe Holothuroidea into Pneumophora and Apneumona; and Crinoids were\r\ndiscussed under the heads \"stalked\" and \"unstalked.\" The barriers\r\nbetween these groups may be regarded as horizontal planes cutting across\r\nthe branches of the ascending tree of life at levels determined chiefly\r\nby our ignorance; as knowledge increases, and as the conception of a\r\ngenealogical classification gains acceptance, they are being replaced by\r\nvertical partitions which separate branch from branch. The changes may\r\nbe appreciated by comparing the systematic synopses at the end of this\r\narticle with the classification adopted in 1877 in the 9th edition of\r\nthe _Ency. Brit._ (vol. vii.), or in any zoological text-book\r\ncontemporary therewith. In the present stage of our knowledge these\r\nminor divisions are the really important ones. For, whereas to one\r\nbrilliant suggestion of far-reaching homology another can always be\r\nopposed, by the detailed comparison of individual growth-stages in\r\ncarefully selected series of fossils, and by the minute application to\r\nthese of the principle that individual history repeats race history, it\r\nactually is possible to unfold lines of descent that do not admit of\r\ndoubt. The gradual linking up of these will manifest the true genealogy\r\nof each class, and reconstruct its ancestral forms by proof instead of\r\nconjecture. The problem of the interrelations of the classes will thus\r\nbe reduced to its simplest terms, and even questions as to the nature of\r\nthe primitive Echinoderm and its affinity to the ancestors of other\r\nphyla may become more than exercises for the ingenuity of youth. Work\r\nhas been and is being done by the laborious methods here alluded to, and\r\nthough the diversity of opinion as to the broader groupings of\r\nclassification is still restricted only by the number of writers, we can\r\npoint to an ever-increasing body of assured knowledge on which all are\r\nagreed. Unfortunately such allusion to these disconnected certainties as\r\nalone might be introduced here would be too brief for comprehension,\r\nand we are forced to select a few of the broader hypotheses for a\r\ntreatment that may seem dogmatic and prejudiced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Diagram of a simple form of Crinoid, with five\r\narms, each forking once; the one nearest the observer is removed to\r\nexpose the tegmen of five orals. This crinoid has only two circlets of\r\nplates in the cup, but the cup analysed in the adjoining diagram has in\r\naddition infrabasals and a centrale C.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--An early stage in the development of _Antedon_,\r\nshowing the foot-plate or \"dorso-central\" _fp_ at the end of the stem\r\n_col._ Some of the thecal plates, infrabasals _I B_, basals B, and orals\r\n_O_ are forming around the body-cavities _r.pc_ and _l.pc_; _p_ is the\r\nwater-pore. (After Seeliger.)]\r\n\r\n  _Calycinal Theory._--The theory which had most influence on the\r\n  conceptions of Echinoderms in the two concluding decades of the 19th\r\n  century was that of Loven, elaborated by P.H. Carpenter, Sladen and\r\n  others. This, which may be called the _calycinal_ theory, will be\r\n  appreciated by comparing the structure of a simple crinoid with that\r\n  of some other types. A crinoid reduced to its simplest elements\r\n  consists of three principal portions--(i.) a theca or test enclosing\r\n  the viscera; (ii.) five arms stretching upwards or outwards from the\r\n  theca, sometimes single, sometimes branching; (iii.) a stem stretching\r\n  downwards from the theca and attaching it to the sea-floor (see fig.\r\n  1). That part of the theca below the origins of the free arms is\r\n  called the \"dorsal cup\"; the ventral part above the origins of the\r\n  arms, serving as cover to the cup, is known as the \"tegmen.\" All these\r\n  parts are supported by plates or ossicles of crystalline carbonate of\r\n  lime. The cup, in its simplest form, consists of two circlets of five\r\n  plates. Each plate of the upper circlet supports an arm, and is called\r\n  a \"radial\"; the plates of the lower circlet, the \"basals,\" rest on the\r\n  stem and alternate with those of the upper circlet, i.e. are\r\n  interradial in position. Some crinoids have yet another circlet below\r\n  these, the constituent plates of which are called \"infrabasals,\" and\r\n  are situated radially. The tegmen in most primitive forms, as well as\r\n  in the embryonic stages of the living _Antedon_ (fig. 2), consists of\r\n  five large triangular plates, alternating with the radials, and called\r\n  \"orals,\" because they roof over the mouth. In addition to these three\r\n  or four circlets of plates, two other elements were once supposed\r\n  essential to the ideal crinoid: the dorso-central and the oro-central.\r\n  The former term was applied to a flattened plate observed in the\r\n  embryonic stage of a single genus (_Antedon_) at that end of the stem\r\n  attached to the sea-floor, and comparable to the foot of a wine-glass\r\n  (fig. 2). In some crinoids which have no trace of a stem (e.g.\r\n  _Marsupites_) a pentagonal plate is found at the bottom of the cup,\r\n  where the stem would naturally have arisen (\"centrale\" in fig. 1); and\r\n  since it was believed that the stem always grew by addition of\r\n  ossicles immediately below the infrabasals, it was inferred that this\r\n  pentagonal plate was the centro-dorsal in its primitive position, as\r\n  though the wine-glass had been evolved from a tumbler by pulling the\r\n  bottom out to form the foot. The oro-central was, it must be admitted,\r\n  a theoretical conception due to a desire for symmetry, and was not\r\n  confirmed by anything better than some erroneous observations on\r\n  certain fossils, which were supposed to show a plate at the oral pole\r\n  between the five orals; but this plate, so far as it exists at all, is\r\n  now known to be nothing but an oral shifted in position. The theory\r\n  was that all the plates just described, and more particularly those of\r\n  the cup, which were termed \"the calycinal system,\" could be traced,\r\n  not merely in all crinoids, but in all Echinoderms, whether fixed\r\n  forms such as cystids and blastoids, or free forms such as ophiuroids\r\n  and echinoids, even--with the eye of faith--in holothurians. It was\r\n  admitted that these elements might atrophy, or be displaced, or be\r\n  otherwise obscured; but their complete and symmetrical disposition was\r\n  regarded as typical and original. Thus the genera exhibiting it were\r\n  regarded as primitive, and those orders and classes in which it was\r\n  least obscured were supposed to approach most nearly the ancestral\r\n  Echinoderm. Every one knows that an \"apical system,\" composed of two\r\n  circlets known as \"genitals\" or basals and \"oculars\" or radials,\r\n  occurs round the aboral pole of echinoids (fig. 3, A), and that a few\r\n  genera (e.g. _Salenia_, fig. 3, B) possess a sub-central plate (the\r\n  \"suranal\"), which might be identified with the centro-dorsal. It is\r\n  also the case that many asterids (fig. 3, D) and ophiurids (fig. 3, C)\r\n  have a similar arrangement of plates on the dorsal (i.e. aboral)\r\n  surface of the disk. Accepting the homology of these apical systems\r\n  with the calycinal system, the theory would regard the aboral pole of\r\n  a sea-urchin or starfish as corresponding in everything, except its\r\n  relations to the sea-floor, with the aboral pole of a fixed\r\n  echinoderm.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 3.-Supposed calycinal systems of free-moving\r\n  Echinoderms. A, regular sea-urchin (_Cidaris_); B, sea-urchin with a\r\n  suranal plate (_Salenia_); C, developing ophiurid (_Amphiura_); D,\r\n  young starfish (_Zoroaster_).]\r\n\r\n  The theory has been vigorously opposed, notably by Semon (_op. cit._),\r\n  who saw in the holothurians a nearer approach to the ancestral form\r\n  than was furnished by any calyculate echinoderm, and by the Sarasins,\r\n  who derived the echinoids from the holothurians through forms with\r\n  flexible tests (_Echinothuridae_, which, however, are now known to be\r\n  specialized in this respect). The support that appeared to be given to\r\n  the theory by the presence of supposed calycinal plates in the embryo\r\n  of echinoids and asteroids has been, in the opinion of many,\r\n  undermined by E.W. MacBride (_op. cit._), who has insisted that in the\r\n  fixed stage of the developing starfish, _Asterina_, the relations of\r\n  these plates to the stem are quite different from those which they\r\n  bear in the developing and adult crinoid. But, however correct the\r\n  observations and the homologies of MacBride may be, they do not, as\r\n  Bury (_op. cit._) has well pointed out, afford sufficient grounds for\r\n  his inference that the abactinal (i.e. aboral) poles of starfish and\r\n  crinoids are not comparable with one another, and that all conclusions\r\n  based on the supposed homology of the dorso-central of echinoids and\r\n  asteroids with that of crinoids are incorrect. Bury himself, however,\r\n  has inflicted a severe blow on the theory by his proof that the\r\n  so-called oculars of Echinoidea, which were supposed to represent the\r\n  radials, are homologous with the \"terminals\" (i.e. the plates at the\r\n  tips of the rays) in Asteroidea and Ophiuroidea, and therefore not\r\n  homologous with the radially disposed plates often seen around the\r\n  aboral pole of those animals. For, if these radial constituents of the\r\n  supposed apical system in an ophiurid have really some other origin,\r\n  why can we not say the same of the supposed basals? Indeed, Bury is\r\n  constrained to admit that the view of Semon and others may be correct,\r\n  and that these so-called calycinal systems may not be heirlooms from a\r\n  calyculate ancestor, but may have been independently developed in the\r\n  various classes owing to the action of similar causes. That this view\r\n  must be correct is urged by students of fossils. Palaeontology lends\r\n  no support to the idea that the dorso-central is a primitive element;\r\n  it exists in none of the early echinoids, and the suranal of\r\n  _Saleniidae_ arises from the minor plates around the anus. There is no\r\n  reason to suppose that the central apical plate of certain\r\n  free-swimming crinoids has any more to do with the distal foot-plate\r\n  of the larval _Antedon_ stem than has the so-called centro-dorsal of\r\n  _Antedon_ itself, which is nothing but the compressed proximal end of\r\n  the stem. As for the supposed basals of Echinoidea, Asteroidea and\r\n  Ophiuroidea, they are scarcely to be distinguished among the ten or\r\n  more small plates that surround the anus of _Bothriocidaris_, which is\r\n  the oldest and probably the most ancestral of fossil sea-urchins (fig.\r\n  5). A calycinal system may be quite apparent in the later Ophiuroidea\r\n  and in a few Asteroidea, but there is no trace of it in the older\r\n  Palaeozoic types, unless we are to transfer the appellation to the\r\n  terminals. Those plates are perhaps constant throughout sea-urchins\r\n  and starfish (though it would puzzle any one to detect them in certain\r\n  Silurian echinoids), and they may be traced in some of the fixed\r\n  echinoderms; but there is no proof that they represent the radials of\r\n  a simple crinoid, and there are certainly many cystids in which no\r\n  such plates existed.

Neumayr adduced the Triassic\r\n  sea-urchin _Tiarechinus_, in which the apical system forms half of the\r\n  test, as an argument for the origin of Echinoidea from an ancestor in\r\n  which the apical system was of great importance; but a genus appearing\r\n  so late in time, in an isolated sea, under conditions that dwarfed the\r\n  other echinoid dwellers therein, cannot seriously be thought to\r\n  elucidate the origin of pre-Silurian Echinoidea, and the recent\r\n  discovery of an intermediate form suggests that we have here nothing\r\n  but degenerate descendants of a well-known Palaeozoic family\r\n  (_Lepidocentridae_). But to pursue the tale of isolated instances\r\n  would be wearisome. The calycinal theory is not merely an assertion of\r\n  certain homologies, a few of which might be disputed without affecting\r\n  the rest: it governs our whole conception of the echinoderms, because\r\n  it implies their descent from a calyculate ancestor--not a\r\n  \"crinoid-phantom,\" that bogey of the Sarasins, but a form with\r\n  definite plates subject to a quinqueradiate arrangement, with which\r\n  its internal organs must likewise have been correlated. To this\r\n  ingenious and plausible theory the revelations of the rocks are more\r\n  and more believed to be opposed.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 4.--The _Pentactula_ stage in the development of\r\n  _Synapta_.\r\n\r\n    T, The five interradial tentacles.\r\n    M, The water-pore, leading by the stone-canal stc to the water-ring,\r\n      from which hangs a Polian vesicle pb.\r\n    oc, Supposed otocysts.\r\n    m, Longitudinal muscles.\r\n    sk, Calcareous spicules.\r\n    st, Stomach.\r\n   (After Semon.)]\r\n\r\n  _Pentactaea Theory._--In opposition to the calycinal theory has been\r\n  the _Pentactaea_ theory of R. Semon. There have always been many\r\n  zoologists prepared to ascribe an ancestral character to the\r\n  holothurians. The absence of an apical system of plates; the fact that\r\n  radial symmetry has not affected the generative organs, as it has in\r\n  all other recent classes; the well-developed muscles of the body-wall,\r\n  supposed to be directly inherited from some worm-like ancestor; the\r\n  presence on the inner walls of the body in the family _Synaptidae_ of\r\n  ciliated funnels, which have been rashly compared to the excretory\r\n  organs (nephridia) of many worms; the outgrowth from the rectum in\r\n  other genera of caeca (Cuvierian organs and respiratory trees), which\r\n  recall the anal glands of the Gephyrean worms; the absence of podia\r\n  (tube-feet) in many genera, and even of the radial water-vessels in\r\n  _Synaptidae_; the absence of that peculiar structure known in other\r\n  echinoderms by the names \"axial organ,\" \"ovoid gland,\" &c.; the\r\n  simpler form of the larva--all these features have, for good reason or\r\n  bad, been regarded as primitive. Some of the more striking of these\r\n  features are confined to _Synaptidae_; in that family too the absence\r\n  of the radial water-vessels from the adult is correlated with\r\n  continuity of the circular muscle-layer, while the gut runs almost\r\n  straight from the anterior mouth to the posterior anus. Early in the\r\n  life-history of _Synapta_ occurs a stage with five tentacles around\r\n  the mouth, and into these pass canals from the water-ring, the radial\r\n  canals to the body-wall making a subsequent, and only temporary,\r\n  appearance (fig. 4). Semon called this stage the _Pentactula_, and\r\n  supposed that, in its early history, the class had passed through a\r\n  similar stage, which he called the _Pentactaea_, and regarded as the\r\n  ancestor of all Echinoderms. It has since been proved that the five\r\n  tentacles with their canals are interradial, so that one can scarcely\r\n  look on the _Pentactula_ as a primitive stage, while the apparent\r\n  simplicity of the _Synaptidae_, at least as compared with other\r\n  holothurians, is now believed to be the result of regressive changes.\r\n  The _Pentactaea_, at all events as it sprang from the brain of Semon,\r\n  must pass to the limbo of mythological ancestors.\r\n\r\n  _Pelmatozoic Theory._--The rejection of the calycinal and _Pentactaea_\r\n  theories need not scatter our conceptions of Echinoderm structure back\r\n  into the chaos from which they seemed to have emerged. The idea of a\r\n  calyculate ancestor, though by no means connoting fixation, turned\r\n  men's minds in the direction of the fixed forms, simply because in\r\n  them the calyx was best developed. The _Pentactaea_ again suggested a\r\n  search for some primitive type in which quinqueradiate symmetry was\r\n  exhibited in circumoral appendages, but had not affected the nervous,\r\n  water-vascular, muscular or skeletal systems to any great extent, and\r\n  the generative organs not at all. Study of the earliest larval stages\r\n  has always led to the conclusion that the Echinoderms must have\r\n  descended from some freely-moving form with a bilateral symmetry, and,\r\n  connecting this with the ideas just mentioned, we reach the conception\r\n  that this supposed bilateral ancestor (or _Dipleurula_) may have\r\n  become fixed, and may have gradually acquired a radial symmetry in\r\n  consequence of its sedentary mode of life. The different extent of\r\n  quinqueradiate symmetry in the different classes would thus depend on\r\n  the period at which they diverged from the sedentary stock. The\r\n  tracing of this history, and the explanation of the general characters\r\n  of Echinoderms and of the differentiating features of the classes in\r\n  accordance therewith, constitutes the _Pelmatozoic_ theory.\r\n\r\n  The word \"Pelmatozoa\" literally means \"stalked animals,\" but the name\r\n  is now used to denote all Cystidea, Blastoidea, Crinoidea and\r\n  Edrioasteroidea, as opposed to the other classes, which may be called\r\n  Eleutherozoa. Many Pelmatozoa have, it is true, no stalk, while some\r\n  are freely-moving, but all agree in the possession of certain\r\n  characters obviously connected with a fixed mode of life. Thus, the\r\n  mouth is central and turned away from the sea-floor; the animal does\r\n  not seize its food by tentacles, limbs or jaws, neither does it move\r\n  in search of it, but a series of ciliated grooves which radiate from\r\n  the mouth sweep along currents of water, in the eddies of which minute\r\n  food-particles are caught up and carried down into the gullet; the\r\n  undigested food is driven out through an anus which is on the upper or\r\n  oral side of the theca, but as far distant as practicable from the\r\n  mouth and ciliated grooves. Such characters are found in any\r\n  primitive, sedentary group. More peculiarly Echinoderm features, in\r\n  which the Pelmatozoan nature is manifest, are the enclosing of the\r\n  viscera in a calcified and plated theca, for protection against those\r\n  enemies from which a fixed animal cannot flee; the development, at the\r\n  aboral pole of this theca, of a motor nerve-centre giving off branches\r\n  to the stroma connecting the various plates of the theca and of its\r\n  brachial, anal, and columnar extensions, and thus co-ordinating the\r\n  movements of the whole skeleton; the absence of suckers from the\r\n  podia, which, when present, are respiratory, not locomotor, in\r\n  function. There are other features of most, if not all, Pelmatozoa\r\n  that appear to be due to a fixed existence; but those are also found\r\n  in the Eleutherozoa. The Pelmatozoic theory thus regards the\r\n  Pelmatozoa as the more ancestral forms, and the Pelmatozoan stage as\r\n  one that must have been passed through by all Echinoderms during their\r\n  evolution from the _Dipleurula_. It might be possible to prove the\r\n  origin of all classes from Pelmatozoa, without thereby explaining the\r\n  origin of such fundamental features as radial symmetry, the\r\n  developmental metamorphosis, and the torsion that affects both gut and\r\n  body-cavities during that process; but the acceptance of a\r\n  _Dipleurula_ as the common ancestor necessitates an explanation of\r\n  these features. Such explanation is an integral part of the\r\n  Pelmatozoic theory, but is provided by no other.\r\n\r\n  The evidence for the Pelmatozoic theory is supplied by palaeontology,\r\n  embryology, the comparative anatomy of the classes, and a\r\n  consideration of other phyla. Palaeontology, so far as it goes, is a\r\n  sure guide, but some of the oldest fossiliferous rocks yield remains\r\n  of distinctly differentiated crinoids, asteroids and echinoids, so\r\n  that the problem is not solved merely by collecting fossils. Two lines\r\n  of argument appear fruitful. First, a comparison of the relative\r\n  numbers of the representatives of the various classes at different\r\n  epochs; according to this they may be placed in the following order,\r\n  with the oldest first: Cystidea, Crinoidea, Blastoidea, Asteroidea,\r\n  Ophiuroidea, Echinoidea. As for Holothuroidea, the fossil evidence\r\n  allows us to say no more than that the class existed in early\r\n  Carboniferous times, if not before. The second method is to work out\r\n  by slow and sure steps the lines of descent of the different families,\r\n  orders, and classes, and so either to arrive at the ancestral form of\r\n  each class, or to plot out the curve of evolution, which may then\r\n  legitimately be projected into \"the dark backward and abysm of time.\"\r\n  In this way the many highly modified orders of Cystidea may be traced\r\n  back to a simple, many-plated ancestor with little or no radiate\r\n  symmetry (see below). All the complicated structures of Blastoidea are\r\n  evolved from a fairly simple type, which in its turn is linked on to\r\n  one of the cystid orders. That the crinoids are all deducible from\r\n  some such simple form as that above described under the head\r\n  \"calycinal theory,\" is now generally admitted. Although, in the\r\n  extreme correlation of the radial food-grooves, nerves, water-vessels,\r\n  and so forth, with a radiate symmetry of the theca, such a type\r\n  differs from the Cystidea, while in the possession of jointed\r\n  processes from the radial plates, bearing the grooves and the various\r\n  body-systems outwards from the theca, it differs from all other\r\n  Echinoderms, nevertheless ancient forms are known which, if they are\r\n  not themselves the actual links, suggest how the crinoid type may have\r\n  been evolved from some of the more regular cystids. The fourth class\r\n  of Pelmatozoa--the Edrioasteroidea--differs from the others in the\r\n  structure of its ambulacra. As in all Pelmatozoa these seem to have\r\n  borne ciliated food-grooves protected by movable covering-plates (fig.\r\n  11). Beneath each food-groove was a radial water-vessel and probably a\r\n  nerve and blood-vessel, all which structures passed either between\r\n  certain regularly arranged thecal plates, or along a furrow floored by\r\n  those plates, which were then in two alternating series. The important\r\n  and distinctive feature is the presence of pores between the\r\n  flooring-plates, on either side of the groove; and these, we cannot\r\n  doubt, served for the passage of podia. Thus in a highly developed\r\n  edrioasteroid, such as _Edrioaster_ itself (fig. 11), there was a true\r\n  ambulacrum, apparently constructed like that of a starfish, but\r\n  differing in the possession of a ciliated food-groove protected by\r\n  covering-plates. The simpler forms of Edrioasteroidea, with their more\r\n  sac-like body and undifferentiated plates, may well have been derived\r\n  from early Cystidea of yet simpler structure, and there seems no\r\n  reason to follow Jaekel in regarding the class as itself the more\r\n  primitive. Turning to fossil Asteroidea, we find the earlier ophiurids\r\n  scarcely distinguishable from the asterids, while in the alternation\r\n  of the ambulacrals, which undoubtedly correspond to the\r\n  flooring-plates of _Edrioaster_, both groups approach the Pelmatozoan\r\n  type. These facts have been expressed by Sturtz in his names\r\n  Encrinasteriae and Ophio-encrinasteriae. There is no difficulty in\r\n  deducing the highly differentiated asterids and ophiurids of a later\r\n  day from these simpler types. The evolution of the modern Echinoidea\r\n  from their Palaeozoic ancestors is also well understood, but in this\r\n  case the ancestral form to which the palaeontologist is led does not\r\n  at first sight present many resemblances to the Pelmatozoa. It is,\r\n  however, characterized by simplicity of structure, and a short\r\n  description of it will serve to clear the problem from unnecessary\r\n  difficulties. _Bothriocidaris_ (fig. 5), a small echinoid from the\r\n  Ordovician rocks of Esthonia, is in essential structure just the form\r\n  demanded by comparative palaeontology to make a starting-point. It is\r\n  spheroidal, with the mouth and anus at opposite poles; there are five\r\n  ambulacra, and the ambulacral plates are large, simple and\r\n  alternating, each being pierced by two podial pores which lie in a\r\n  small oval depression; the ambulacrals next the mouth form a closed\r\n  ring of ten plates; the interambulacrals lie in single columns between\r\n  the ambulacra, and are separated from the mouth-area by the proximal\r\n  ambulacrals just mentioned, and sometimes by the second set of\r\n  ambulacrals also; the ambulacra end in the five oculars or terminals,\r\n  which meet in a ring around the anal area and have no podial pores,\r\n  but one of them serves as a madreporite; within this ring is a\r\n  star-shaped area filled with minute irregular plates, none of which\r\n  can safely be selected as the homologues of the so-called basals or\r\n  genitals of later forms; within the ring of ambulacrals around the\r\n  mouth are five somewhat pointed plates, which Jaekel regards as teeth,\r\n  but which can scarcely be homologous with the interradially placed\r\n  teeth of later echinoids, since they are radial in position; small\r\n  spines are present, especially around the podial pores. The position\r\n  of the pores near the centre of the ambulacrals in _Bothriocidaris_\r\n  need not be regarded as primitive, since other early Palaeozoic\r\n  genera, not to mention the young of living forms, show that the podia\r\n  originally passed out between the plates, and were only gradually\r\n  surrounded by their substance; thus the original structure of the\r\n  echinoid ambulacra differed from that of the early asteroid in the\r\n  position of the radial vessels and nerves, which here lie beneath the\r\n  plates instead of outside them. To this point we shall recur;\r\n  palaeontology, though it suggests a clue, does not furnish an actual\r\n  link either between Echinoidea and Asteroidea, or between those\r\n  classes and Pelmatozoa.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 5.--_Bothriocidaris globulus._ A, from the side;\r\n  B, the plates around the aboral pole. (After Jaekel.) The short spines\r\n  which were attached to the tubercles are not drawn.]\r\n\r\n  The argument from embryology leads further back. First, as already\r\n  mentioned, it outlines the general features of the _Dipleurula_;\r\n  secondly, it indicates the way in which this free-moving form became\r\n  fixed, and how its internal organs were modified in consequence; but\r\n  when we seek, thirdly, for light on the relations of the classes, we\r\n  find the features of the adult coming in so rapidly that such\r\n  intermediate stages as may have existed are either squeezed out or\r\n  profoundly modified. The difficulty of rearing the larvae in an\r\n  aquarium towards the close of the metamorphosis may account for the\r\n  slight information available concerning the stages that immediately\r\n  follow the embryonic. Another difficulty is due to the fact that the\r\n  types studied, and especially the crinoid _Antedon_, are highly\r\n  specialized, so that some of the embryonic features are not really\r\n  primitive as regards the class, but only as regards each particular\r\n  genus. Thus inferences from embryonic development need to be checked\r\n  by palaeontology, and supplemented by comparison of the anatomy of\r\n  other living genera.\r\n\r\n  Minute anatomical research has also aided to establish the Pelmatozoic\r\n  theory by the gradual recognition in other classes of features\r\n  formerly supposed to be confined to Pelmatozoa. Thus the elements of\r\n  the Pelmatozoan ventral groove are now detected in so different a\r\n  structure as the echinoid ambulacrum, while an aboral nervous system,\r\n  the diminished representative of that in crinoids, has been traced in\r\n  all Eleutherozoa except Holothurians. The broader theories of modern\r\n  zoology might seem to have little bearing on the Echinoderma, for it\r\n  is not long since the study of these animals was compared to a\r\n  landlocked sea undisturbed by such storms as rage around the origin of\r\n  the Vertebrata. This, however, is no more the case. The conception of\r\n  the _Dipleurula_ derives its chief weight from the fact that it is\r\n  comparable to the early larval forms of other primitive coelomate\r\n  animals, such as _Balanoglossus_, _Phoronis_, Chaetognatha,\r\n  Brachiopoda and Bryozoa. So too the explanation of radial symmetry and\r\n  torsion of organs as due to a Pelmatozoic mode of life finds\r\n  confirmation in many other phyla. Instead of discussing all these\r\n  questions separately, with the details necessary for an adequate\r\n  presentation of the argument, we shall now sketch the history of the\r\n  Echinoderms in accordance with the Pelmatozoic theory. Such a sketch\r\n  must pass lightly over debatable ground, and must consist largely of\r\n  suggestions still in need of confirmation; but if it serves as a frame\r\n  into which more precise and more detailed statements may be fitted as\r\n  they come to the ken of the reader, its object will be attained.\r\n\r\n_Evolution of the Echinoderms._--It is reasonable to suppose that the\r\nCoelomata--animals in which the body-cavity is divided into a gut\r\npassing from mouth to anus and a hollow (coelom) surrounding it--were\r\nderived from the simpler Coelentera, in which the primitive body-cavity\r\n(archenteron) is not so divided, and has only one aperture serving as\r\nboth mouth and anus. We may, with Sedgwick, suppose the coelom to have\r\noriginated by the enlargement and separation of pouches that pressed\r\noutwards from the archenteron into the thickened body-wall (such\r\nstructures as the genital pouches of some Coelentera, not yet shut off\r\nfrom the rest of the cavity), and they would probably have been four in\r\nnumber and radially disposed about the central cavity. The evolution of\r\nthis cavity into a gut is foreshadowed in some Coelentera by the\r\nelliptical shape of the aperture, and by the development at its ends of\r\na ciliated channel along which food is swept; we have only to suppose\r\nthe approximation of the sides of the ellipse and their eventual fusion,\r\nto complete the transformation of the radially symmetrical Coelenterate\r\ninto a bilaterally symmetrical Coelomate with mouth and anus at opposite\r\nends of the long axis. We further suppose that of the four coelomic\r\npouches one was in front of the mouth, one behind the anus, and one on\r\neach side. Such an animal, if it ever existed, probably lived near the\r\nsurface of the sea, and even here it may have changed its medusoid mode\r\nof locomotion for one in the direction of its mouth. Thus the bilateral\r\nsymmetry would have been accentuated, and the organism shaped more\r\ndefinitely into three segments, namely (1) a preoral segment or lobe,\r\ncontaining the anterior coelomic cavity; (2) a middle segment,\r\ncontaining the gut, and the two middle coelomic cavities; (3) a\r\nposterior segment, containing the posterior coelomic cavity, which,\r\nhowever, owing to the backward prolongation of the anus, became divided\r\ninto two--a right and left posterior coelom. Each of these cavities\r\npresumably excreted waste products to the exterior by a pore. There was\r\nprobably a nervous area, with a tuft of cilia, at the anterior end;\r\nwhile, at all events in forms that remained pelagic, the ciliated\r\nnervous tracts of the rest of the body may be supposed to have become\r\narranged in bands around the body-segments. Such a form as this is\r\nroughly represented to-day by the _Actinotrocha_ larva of _Phoronis_,\r\nthe importance of which has been brought out by Masterman. But only\r\nslight modifications are required to produce the _Tornaria_ larva of the\r\nEnteropneusta and other larvae, including the special type that is\r\ninferred from the _Dipleurula_ larval stages of recent forms to have\r\ncharacterized the ancestor of the Echinoderms. We cannot enter here\r\ninto all the details of comparison between these larval forms; amid much\r\nthat is hypothetical a few homologies are widely accepted, and the\r\npreceding account will show the kind of relation that the Echinoderms\r\nbear to other animals, including what are now usually regarded as the\r\nancestors of the Chordata (to which back-boned animals belong), as well\r\nas the nature of the evidence that their study has been, or may be, made\r\nto yield. How the hypothetical _Dipleurula_ became an Echinoderm, and\r\nhow the primitive Echinoderms diverged in structure so as to form the\r\nvarious classes, are questions to which an answer is attempted in the\r\nfollowing paragraphs:--\r\n\r\n  Confining our attention to that form of Dipleurula (fig. 6) which, it\r\n  is supposed, gave rise to the Echinoderma, we infer from embryological\r\n  data that its special features were as follow:--The anterior coelomic\r\n  cavity was wholly or partially divided, and from each half a duct led\r\n  to the exterior, opening at a pore near the middle line of the back.\r\n  The middle cavities were smaller, and the ducts from them came to\r\n  unite with those from the anterior cavities, and no longer opened\r\n  directly to the exterior; whether these cavities were already\r\n  specialized as water-sacs cannot be asserted, but they certainly had\r\n  become so at a slightly later stage. The posterior cavities were the\r\n  largest, but what had become of their original opening to the exterior\r\n  is uncertain. The genital products were derived from the lining of the\r\n  coelomic cavities, but it would not be safe to say that any particular\r\n  region was as yet specialized for generation. The epithelium of the\r\n  outer surface was probably ciliated, and a portion of it in the\r\n  preoral lobe differentiated as a sense-organ, with longer cilia and\r\n  underlying nerve-centre, from which two nerves ran back below the\r\n  ventral surface. Into the space between the walls of the coelom and\r\n  the outer body-wall, originally filled with jelly, definite cells now\r\n  wandered, chiefly derived from the coelomic walls. Some of these cells\r\n  produced muscles and connective tissue; others absorbed and removed\r\n  waste products, iron salts, calcium carbonate and the like, and so\r\n  were ready to be utilized for the deposition of pigment or of skeletal\r\n  substance. In some of these respects the _Dipleurula_ may have\r\n  diverged from the ancestor of Enteropneusta and of other animals, but\r\n  it could not as yet have been recognized as echinodermal by a\r\n  zoologist, for it presented none of the structural peculiarities of\r\n  the modern adult echinoderm.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 6.--Diagrammatic reconstruction of _Dipleurula_.\r\n  The creature is represented crawling on the sea-floor, but it may\r\n  equally well have been a floating animal. The ciliated bands are not\r\n  drawn.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 7.--Diagrammatic reconstruction of primitive\r\n  Pelmatozoon, seen from the side. The plates of the test are not drawn;\r\n  their probable appearance may be gathered from fig. 8.]\r\n\r\n  Now ensued the great event that originated the phylum--the discovery\r\n  of the sea-floor. This being apprehended by the sensory anterior end,\r\n  it was by that end that the _Dipleurula_ attached itself; not,\r\n  however, by the pole, since that would have interfered at once with\r\n  the sensory organ, but a little to one side, the right side being the\r\n  one chosen for a reason we cannot now fathom; it may be that fixation\r\n  was facilitated by the presence of the pore on that side, and by the\r\n  utilization of the excretion from it as a cement. The first result was\r\n  that which is always seen to follow in such cases--the passage of the\r\n  mouth towards the upper surface (fig. 7). As it passed up along the\r\n  left side, the gut caught hold of the left water-sac and pulled it\r\n  upwards, curving it in the process; this being attached to the left\r\n  duct from the anterior body-cavity, this structure with its water-pore\r\n  was also pulled up, and the pore came to lie between mouth and anus.\r\n  The forward portion of the anterior coelom shared in the constriction\r\n  and elongation of the preoral lobe; but its hinder portion was dragged\r\n  up along with the water-pore and formed a canal lying along the outer\r\n  wall (the parietal canal). As the gut coiled, it pressed inwards the\r\n  middle of the left posterior coelom of the _Dipleurula_, and drew the\r\n  whole towards the mouth, while the corresponding cavity on the right\r\n  was pressed down by the stomach towards the fixed end of the animal\r\n  and became involved in the elongation of that region. These changes,\r\n  which may still be traced in the development of _Antedon_, resulted in\r\n  the primitive Pelmatozoon (fig. 7), represented in the rocks by such a\r\n  genus as _Aritocystis_ (fig. 8). The pear-shaped body is encased in a\r\n  theca formed by a number of polygonal plates, and is attached by its\r\n  narrow end. On the broad upper surface are four openings, that nearest\r\n  the centre being the mouth, which is slit-like, and that nearest the\r\n  periphery being the anus. The two other openings are minute, and\r\n  placed between those two; one close to the mouth is almost certainly\r\n  the water-pore, while that nearer the anus is regarded as a genital\r\n  aperture. Which of the coelomic cavities this last is connected with\r\n  is uncertain, for there is considerable doubt as to the origin of the\r\n  genital glands in the embryonic development of recent echinoderms. It\r\n  seems clear, however, that there was but a single duct and a single\r\n  bunch of reproductive cells, as in the holothurians, though perhaps\r\n  bifurcate, as in some of those animals. The line between mouth and\r\n  anus, along which these openings are situate, corresponds with the\r\n  plane of union between the two horns of the curved left posterior\r\n  coelom, the united walls of which form the \"dorsal mesentery.\" Since\r\n  this must have, on our theory, enclosed the parietal canal from the\r\n  anterior coelom, it is possible that the genital products were\r\n  developed from the lining cells of that cavity, and that the genital\r\n  pore was nothing but its original pore not yet united with that from\r\n  the water-sac. The concrescence of these pores can be traced in other\r\n  cystids; but as the genital organs became affected by radial symmetry\r\n  the original function of the duct was lost, and the reproductive\r\n  elements escaped to the exterior in another way. _Aristocystis_ may\r\n  have had ciliated food-grooves leading to its mouth, but these have\r\n  left no traces on the structure of the test. Traces, however, are\r\n  perceptible in genera believed to be descended from such a simple\r\n  type, and the majority may be grouped under two heads. One group\r\n  includes those in which the grooves wander outwards from the mouth\r\n  over the thecal plates, which gradually become arranged regularly on\r\n  either side of the grooves, while further extensions ascend from the\r\n  grooves on small jointed processes called \"brachioles\" (fig. 9). In\r\n  the other group the grooves do not tend so much to stretch over the\r\n  theca as to be raised away from it on relatively larger brachioles,\r\n  arising close around the mouth (fig. 10).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 8.--_Aristocystis bohemicus_; side-view of the\r\n  theca. The internal structure may be gathered from fig. 7.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 9.--_Fungocystis rarissima_, one of the\r\n  Diploporita, in which the thecal plates bordering the food-grooves are\r\n  not yet regularly arranged. The brachioles are not drawn.]\r\n\r\n  These two types are, in the main, correlated with two gradual\r\n  differentiations in the minute structure of the thecal plates.\r\n  Originally the calcareous substance of the plates (stereom) was\r\n  pierced by irregular canals, more or less vertical, and containing\r\n  strands of the soft tissue (stroma) that deposited the stereom, as\r\n  well as spaces filled with fluid. In the former group (fig. 9) these\r\n  canals became connected in pairs (diplopores) still perpendicular to\r\n  the surface, and this structure, combined with that of the grooves,\r\n  characterizes the order--Diploporita. In the latter group (fig. 10)\r\n  the canals, that is to say, the stroma-strands, came to lie parallel\r\n  to the surface and to cross the sutures between the plates, which were\r\n  thus more flexibly and more strongly united: since the canals\r\n  crossing each suture naturally occupy a rhombic area, the order is\r\n  called Rhombifera. At first the grooves were three, one proceeding\r\n  from each end of the mouth-slit, and the third in a direction opposed\r\n  to the anus; with reference to the Pelmatozoan structure, the anal\r\n  side may be termed posterior, and this groove anterior. Eventually\r\n  each lateral groove forked, so that there were five grooves. These\r\n  gradually impressed themselves on the theca and influenced the\r\n  arrangement of the internal organs: it is fairly safe to assume that\r\n  nerves, blood-vessels and branches from the water-sac stretched out\r\n  along with these grooves, each system starting from a ring around the\r\n  gullet. At last a quinqueradiate symmetry influenced the plates of the\r\n  theca, partly through the development of a plate at the end of each\r\n  groove (terminal), partly through plates at the aboral pole of the\r\n  theca (basals and infrabasals) arising in response to mechanical\r\n  pressure, but soon intimately connected with the cords of an aboral\r\n  nervous system. Before the latter plates arose, the stem had developed\r\n  by the elongation and constriction of the fixed end of the theca, the\r\n  gradual regularization of the plates involved, and their coalescence\r\n  into rings. The crinoid type was differentiated by the extension of\r\n  the food-grooves and associated organs along radial outgrowths from\r\n  the theca itself. These constituted the arms (brachia), and five\r\n  definite radial plates of the theca were specialized for their\r\n  support. These radials may be homologous with the terminals already\r\n  mentioned, but this is neither necessary nor certain. In this\r\n  development of brachial extensions of the theca the genital organs\r\n  were involved, and their ripe products formed at the ends of the\r\n  brachia or in the branches therefrom. The remains of the original\r\n  genital gland within the theca became the \"axial organ\" surrounded by\r\n  the \"axial sinus\" derived from the anterior coelom, and this again by\r\n  structures derived from the right posterior coelom, which, as\r\n  explained above, had been depressed to the aboral pole. These last\r\n  structures formed a nervous sheath around the axial sinus with its\r\n  blood-vessels, and became divided into five lobes correlated with the\r\n  five basals (the \"chambered organ\") and forming the aboral\r\n  nerve-centre. Before these changes were complete the Holothurioidea\r\n  must have diverged, by the assumption of a crawling existence. Thus in\r\n  them the mouth and anus reverted to opposite poles, and only the\r\n  torsion of the gut and coelom, and the radial extensions of the\r\n  nervous, water-vascular and blood-vascular systems, testified to their\r\n  Pelmatozoan ancestry. The ciliated grooves, no longer needed for the\r\n  collection of food, closed over, and are still traceable as ciliated\r\n  canals overlying the radial nerves. At the same time the thecal plates\r\n  degenerated into spicules. The Edrioasteroidea followed a different\r\n  line from that of the cystids above mentioned and their descendants.\r\n  The theca became sessile, and in its later developments much flattened\r\n  (fig. 11). Mouth, water-pore and anus remained as in _Aristocystis_,\r\n  but the five ciliated grooves radiated from the mouth between the\r\n  thecal plates rather than over them, and were, as usual, protected by\r\n  covering-plates. The important feature was the extension of radial\r\n  canals from the water-sac along these grooves, with branches passing\r\n  between the flooring-plates of the grooves (fig. 12, A). The\r\n  resemblance of the flooring-plates to the ambulacral ossicles of a\r\n  starfish is so exact that one can explain it only by supposing similar\r\n  relations of the water-canals and their branches (podia). On the\r\n  thinly plated under surface of well-preserved specimens of\r\n  _Edrioaster_ are seen five interradial swellings (fig. 11, B). These\r\n  are likely to have been produced by the ripe genital glands, which may\r\n  have extruded their products directly through the membranous\r\n  integument of the under side. No other way out for them is apparent,\r\n  and it is clear that _Edrioaster_ was not permanently and solidly\r\n  fixed to the sea-floor.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 10.--_Chirocrinus-alter_, one of the Rhombifera,\r\n  showing the reduced number and regular arrangement of the thecal\r\n  plates, and the concentration of the brachioles. (Adapted from\r\n  Jaekel.)]\r\n\r\n  Now comes a great change, unfortunately difficult to follow whether in\r\n  the fossils or in the modern embryos. We suppose some such form as\r\n  _Edrioaster_, which appears to have lived near the shore, to have been\r\n  repeatedly overturned by waves. Those that were able to accommodate\r\n  themselves to this topsy-turvy existence, by taking food in directly\r\n  through the mouth, survived, and their podia gradually specialized as\r\n  sucking feet. Such a form as this, when once its covering-plates had\r\n  atrophied, would be a starfish without more ado (fig. 12, B); but the\r\n  sea-urchins present a more difficult problem, on which\r\n  _Bothriocidaris_ sheds no light. An Upper Silurian echinoid, however,\r\n  _Palaeodiscus_, is believed by W.J. Sollas and W.K. Spencer to have\r\n  had in its ambulacra an inner as well as an outer series of plates. If\r\n  this be correct, the only change from _Edrioaster_, as regards the\r\n  ambulacra, was that in _Palaeodiscus_ the covering-plates could no\r\n  longer open, but closed permanently over the whole groove, while the\r\n  podia issued through slits between them. In more typical echinoids the\r\n  covering-plates alone remained to form the ordinary ambulacral plates,\r\n  while the flooring-plates disappeared, the canals and other organs\r\n  remaining as before. In any case we have to admit a closure of the\r\n  integument over the ciliated groove (fig. 12, D, e) just as in\r\n  holothurians, since this is necessitated by anatomical evidence. The\r\n  genital organs in both Asteroidea and Echinoidea would retain the\r\n  interradial position they first assumed in _Edrioaster_; and in\r\n  Echinoidea their primitive temporary openings to the exterior were\r\n  converted into definite pores, correlated with five interradially\r\n  placed plates at the aboral pole. The anus also naturally moved to\r\n  this superior and aboral position. In the Echinoidea the water-canals\r\n  and associated structures, ending in the terminal plates, stretched\r\n  right up to these genital plates; but in the Asteroidea they never\r\n  reached the aboral surface, so that the terminals have always been\r\n  separated from the aboral pole by a number of plates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--_Edrioaster._ A, upper or oral surface of _E.\r\nBigsbyi_, with the covering-plates on the anterior and left posterior\r\nfood-grooves, but removed from the others, which show only the\r\nflooring-plates, between which are pores; B, under surface of _E.\r\nBuchianus_, with covering-plates on right posterior and right anterior\r\nfood-grooves (left hand in the drawing).

Known Echinoderms show the following features, imagined\r\n  to be due to an ancestral pelmatozoic stage:--Increase in the coelomic\r\n  cavities of the left side, and atrophy of those on the right; the\r\n  dextral coil of the gut, recognizable in all classes, though often\r\n  obscured; an incomplete secondary bilateralism about the plane\r\n  including the main axis and the water-pore or its successor, the\r\n  madreporite, often obscured by one or other of various tertiary\r\n  bilateralisms; the change of the hydrocoel into a circumoral, arcuate\r\n  or ring canal; development through a free-swimming, bilaterally\r\n  symmetrical, ciliated larva, of which in many cases only a portion is\r\n  transformed into the adult Echinoderm (where care of the brood has\r\n  secondarily arisen, this larva is not developed). All living, and most\r\n  extinct, Echinoderms show the following features, almost certainly due\r\n  to an ancestral pelmatozoic stage:--An incomplete radial symmetry, of\r\n  which five is usually the dominant number, is superimposed on the\r\n  secondary bilateralism, owing to the outgrowth from the mouth region\r\n  of one unpaired and two paired ciliated grooves; these have a floor of\r\n  nervous epithelium, and are accompanied by subjacent radial canals\r\n  from the water-ring, giving off lateral podia and thus forming\r\n  ambulacra, and by a perihaemal system of canals apparently growing out\r\n  from coelomic cavities. All living Echinoderms have a lacunar, haemal\r\n  system of diverse origin; this, the ambulacral system, and the\r\n  coelomic cavities, contain a fluid holding albumen in solution and\r\n  carrying numerous amoebocytes, which are developed in special\r\n  lymph-glands and are capable of wandering through all tissues. The\r\n  Echinoderms may be divided into seven classes, whose probable\r\n  relations are thus indicated:--\r\n\r\n                 / Cystidea------Edrioasteroidea\r\n                |      |          |\\\r\n    PELMATOZOA <       |          | \\ Holothurioidea \\\r\n                |      |          |                  |\r\n                |  Blastoidea     |                   > ELEUTHEROZOA\r\n                 \\ Crinoidea      |                  |\r\n                                 Stelliformia        |\r\n                                 Echinoidea          /\r\n\r\n  Brief systematic accounts of these classes follow:--\r\n\r\n  Grade A. PELMATOZOA.--Echinoderma with the viscera enclosed in a\r\n  calcified and plated theca, of which the oral surface is uppermost,\r\n  and which is usually attached, either temporarily or permanently, by\r\n  the aboral surface. Food brought to the mouth by a subvective system\r\n  of ciliated grooves, radiating from the mouth either between the\r\n  plates of the theca (endothecal), or over the theca (epithecal), or\r\n  along processes from the theca (exothecal: arms, pinnules, &c.), or,\r\n  in part, and as a secondary development, below the theca (hypothecal).\r\n  Anus usually in the upper or oral half of the theca, and never aboral.\r\n  An aborally-placed motor nerve-centre gives off branches to the stroma\r\n  connecting the various plates of the theca and of its brachial, anal\r\n  and columnar extensions, and thus co-ordinates the movements of the\r\n  whole skeleton. The circumoesophageal water-ring communicates\r\n  indirectly with the exterior; the podia, when present, are\r\n  respiratory, not locomotor, in function.\r\n\r\n  Class I. CYSTIDEA.--Pelmatozoa in which radial polymeric symmetry of\r\n  the theca is developed either not at all or not in complete\r\n  correlation with the radial symmetry of the ambulacra (such as obtains\r\n  in Blastoidea and Crinoidea); in which extensions of the food-grooves\r\n  are exothecal or epithecal or both combined, but neither endothecal\r\n  nor pierced by podia (as in some Edrioasteroidea) All Palaeozoic.\r\n\r\n  This class shows much greater diversity of organization than any\r\n  other, and the classifications proposed by recent writers, such as E.\r\n  Haeckel, O. Jaekel and F.A. Bather, start from such different points\r\n  of view that no discussion of them can be attempted here. Following\r\n  the narrative given above, we recognize a primitive\r\n  group--Amphoridea--represented by _Aristocystis_ (fig. 8). From this\r\n  are derived the orders Diploporita (fig. 9) and Rhombifera (fig. 10)\r\n  and the class Edrioasteroidea, all which have already been described\r\n  as steps in the evolution of the phylum. But there were also\r\n  side-branches leading nowhere, and therefore placed in separate\r\n  orders--Aporita and Carpoidea.\r\n\r\n  Order 1. _Amphoridea._--Radial symmetry has affected neither\r\n  food-grooves nor thecal plates; nor, probably, nerves, ambulacral\r\n  vessels, nor gonads. Canals or folds when present in the stereom are\r\n  irregular. Families: Aristocystidae (fig. 8); Eocystidae.\r\n\r\n  Order 2. _Carpoidea._--Theca compressed in the oro-anal plane and a\r\n  bilateral symmetry thus induced, affecting the food-grooves and,\r\n  usually, the thecal plates and stem. Food-grooves in part epithecal\r\n  and may be continued on one or two exothecal processes. No pores or\r\n  folds in the stereom. Families: Anomalocystidae, Dendrocystidae. These\r\n  correspond to Jaekel's Carpoidea Heterostelea; he also includes, as\r\n  Eustelea, our Comarocystidae and Malocystidae.\r\n\r\n  Order 3. _Rhombifera._--Radial symmetry affects the food-grooves and,\r\n  in the more advanced families, the thecal plates; probably also the\r\n  nerves and ambulacral vessels, but not the gonads. The food-grooves\r\n  are exothecal, i.e. are stretched out from the theca on jointed\r\n  skeletal processes (brachioles). These either are close to the mouth\r\n  or are removed from it upon a series of ambulacral or sub-ambulacral\r\n  plates not derived immediately from thecal plates, or are separated\r\n  from the oral centre by hypothecal passages passing beneath terminal\r\n  plates. The stereom and stroma become arranged in folds and strands at\r\n  right angles to the sutures of the thecal plates; in higher forms the\r\n  stereom-folds are in part specialized as pectini-rhombs. Families:\r\n  Echinosphaeridae; Comarocystidae; Macrocystellidae; Tiaracrinidae;\r\n  Malocystidae; Glyptocystidae, with sub-famm. Echinoencrininae,\r\n  Callocystinae, Glyptocystinae, of which examples are _Cheirocrinus_\r\n  (fig. 10) and _Cystoblastus_ from which Jaekel deduces the blastoids;\r\n  Caryocrinidae.\r\n\r\n  Order 4. _Aporita._--Pentamerous symmetry affects the food-grooves and\r\n  thecal plates; probably also the nerves and ambulacral vessels, but\r\n  not the gonads. Food-grooves exothecal and circumoral. The stereom\r\n  shows no trace of canals, folds, rhombs or diplopores. Family:\r\n  Cryptocrinidae.\r\n\r\n  Order 5. _Diploporita._--Radial symmetry affects the food-grooves, and\r\n  by degrees the thecal plates connected therewith, but not the\r\n  interradial thecal plates; probably also the nerves and ambulacral\r\n  vessels, but not the gonads. The food-grooves are epithecal, i.e. are\r\n  extended over the thecal plates themselves without intermediate\r\n  flooring; they are also prolonged on exothecal brachioles, which line\r\n  the epithecal grooves. The stereom of the thecal plates may be thrown\r\n  into folds, but the mesostroma does not so much tend to lie in strands\r\n  traversing the sutures, nor are pectini-rhombs or pore-rhombs\r\n  developed; diplopores are always present in the mesostereom, but often\r\n  restricted to definite tracts or plates, especially in higher forms.\r\n  Families: Sphaeronidae; Glyptosphaeridae, e.g. _Fungocystis_ (fig. 9);\r\n  Protocrinidae; Mesocystidae; Gomphocystidae.\r\n\r\n  The Protocrinidae lead up to _Proteroblastus_, in which the theca is\r\n  ovoid, sometimes prolonged into a stem, the plates differentiated into\r\n  (a) smooth, irregular, depressed interambulacrals, (b) transversely\r\n  elongate brachioliferous adambulacrals, to which the diplopores, which\r\n  lie at right angles to the main food-groove, are confined. This leads\r\n  almost without a break to the Protoblastoidea.\r\n\r\n  Class II. BLASTOIDEA.--Pelmatozoa in which five (by atrophy four)\r\n  epithecal ciliated grooves, lying on a lancet-shaped plate (? always),\r\n  radiate from a central peristome between five interradial deltoid\r\n  plates, and are edged by alternating side-plates bearing brachioles,\r\n  to which side-branches pass from the grooves. Grooves and peristome\r\n  protected by small plates, which can open over the grooves. The\r\n  generative organs and coelom probably did not send extensions along\r\n  the rays into the brachioles; but apparently nerves from the aboral\r\n  centre, after passing through the thecal plates, met in a circumoral\r\n  ring, from which branches passed into the plate under each main\r\n  food-groove, and thence supplied the brachioles. The thecal plates,\r\n  however irregular in some species, always show defined basals and a\r\n  distinct plate (\"radial\") at the end of each ambulacrum; they are in\r\n  all cases so far affected by pentamerous symmetry that their sutures\r\n  never cross the ambulacra. All Palaeozoic.\r\n\r\n  Division A. _Protoblastoidea._--Blastoidea without interambulacral\r\n  groups of hydrospire-folds hanging into the thecal cavity. Families:\r\n  Asteroblastidae, Blastoidocrinidae. The former might be placed with\r\n  Diploporita, were it not for a greater intimacy of correlation between\r\n  ambulacral and thecal structures than is found in Cystidea as here\r\n  defined. They form a link between the Protocrinidae and--\r\n\r\n  Division B. _Eublastoidea._--Blastoidea in which the thecal plates\r\n  have assumed a definite number and position in 3 circlets, as follows:\r\n  3 basals, 2 large and 1 small; 5 radials, often fork-shaped, forming a\r\n  closed circlet; 5 deltoids, interradial in position, supported on the\r\n  shoulders or processes of the radials, and often surrounding the\r\n  peristome with their oral ends. The stereom of the radials and\r\n  deltoids on each side of the ambulacra is thrown into folds, running\r\n  across the radio-deltoid suture, and hanging down into the thecal\r\n  cavity as respiratory organs (hydrospires).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 13.--A Eublastoid, _Pentremites_.]\r\n\r\n  These are the forms to which the name Blastoidea is usually\r\n  restricted. They have been divided into Regulares and Irregulares, but\r\n  it seems possible to group them according to three series or lines of\r\n  descent, thus:--\r\n\r\n  Series a. _Codonoblastida._--Families: Codasteridae, Pentremitidae\r\n  (fig. 13).\r\n\r\n  Series b. _Troostoblastida._--Families: Troostocrinidae,\r\n  Eleutherocrinidae.\r\n\r\n  Series c. _Granatoblastida._--Families: Nucleocrinidae,\r\n  Orbitremitidae, Pentephyllidae, Zygocrinidae.\r\n\r\n  Class III. CRINOIDEA.--Pelmatozoa in which epithecal extensions of the\r\n  food-grooves, ambulacrals, superficial oral nervous system,\r\n  blood-vascular and water-vascular systems, coelom and genital system\r\n  are continued exothecally upon jointed outgrowths of the abactinal\r\n  thecal plates (_brachia_), carrying with them extensions of the\r\n  abactinal nerve-system. The number of these processes is primitively\r\n  and normally five, but may become less by atrophy. The brachia rise\r\n  from a corresponding number of thecal plates, \"radials (RR).\" Below\r\n  these is always a circlet, or traces of a circlet, of plates\r\n  alternating with the radials, i.e. interradial, and called \"basals\r\n  (BB).\" Through all modifications, which are numerous and vastly\r\n  divergent, these elements persist. A circlet of radially situate\r\n  infrabasals (IBB) may also be present. Below BB or IBB there follows a\r\n  stem, which, however, may be atrophied or totally lost (see fig. 1).\r\n\r\n  The classification here adopted is that of F.A. Bather (1899), which\r\n  departs from that of Wachsmuth and Springer mainly in the separation\r\n  of forms with infrabasals or traces thereof from those in which basals\r\n  only are present. These two series also differ from each other in the\r\n  relations of the abactinal nerve-system. O. Jaekel (1894) has divided\r\n  the crinoids into the orders Cladocrinoidea and Pentacrinoidea, the\r\n  former being the Camerata of Wachsmuth and Springer (Monocyclica\r\n  Camerata, Adunata and Dicyclica Camerata of the present\r\n  classification), and the latter comprising all the rest, in which the\r\n  arms are either free or only loosely incorporated in the dorsal cup.\r\n  In minor points there is fair agreement between the American, German\r\n  and British authors. The families are extinct, except when the\r\n  contrary is stated.\r\n\r\n  Sub-class I. _Monocyclica._--Crinoidea in which the base consists of\r\n  BB only, the aboral prolongations of the chambered organ being\r\n  interradial; new columnals are introduced at the extreme proximal end\r\n  of the stem.\r\n\r\n  Order 1. _Monocyclica Inadunata._--Monocyclica in which the dorsal cup\r\n  is confined to the patina and occasional intercalated anals; such\r\n  ambulacrals or interambulacrals as enter the tegmen remain\r\n  supra-tegminal and not rigidly united. Families: Hybocrinidae,\r\n  Stephanocrinidae, Heterocrinidae, Calceocrinidae, Pisocrinidae,\r\n  Zophocrinidae, Haplocrinidae, Allagecrinidae, Symbathocrinidae,\r\n  Belemnocrinidae, Plicatocrinidae, Hyocrinidae (recent), Saccocomidae.\r\n\r\n  Order 2. _Adunata._--Monocyclica with dorsal cup primitively confined\r\n  to the patina and an occasional single anal; tegmen solid; portions of\r\n  the proximal brachials and their ambulacrals tend to be rigidly\r\n  incorporated in the theca. Arms fork once to thrice, and bear pinnules\r\n  on each or on every other brachial. BB fused to 3, 2 or 1.\r\n  (Eucladocrinus and Acrocrinidae offer peculiar exceptions to this\r\n  diagnosis.) Families: Platycrinidae, Hexacrinidae, Acrocrinidae.\r\n\r\n  Order 3. _Monocyclica Camerata._--Monocyclica in which the first, and\r\n  often the succeeding, orders of brachials are incorporated by\r\n  interbrachials in the dorsal cup, while the corresponding ambulacrals\r\n  are either incorporated in, or pressed below, the tegmen by\r\n  interambulacrals; all thecal plates united by suture, somewhat loose\r\n  in the earliest forms, but speedily becoming close, and producing a\r\n  rigid theca; mouth and tegminal food-grooves closed; arms pinnulate.\r\n\r\n    Sub-order i. _Melocrinoidea._--RR in contact all round; first\r\n    brachial usually quadrangular. Families: Glyptocrinidae,\r\n    Melocrinidae, Patelliocrinidae, Clonocrinidae, Eucalyptocrinidae,\r\n    Dolatocrinidae.\r\n\r\n    Sub-order ii. _Batocrinoidea._--RR separated by a heptagonal anal;\r\n    first brachial usually quadrangular. Families: Tanaocrinidae,\r\n    Xenocrinidae, Carpocrinidae, Barrandeocrinidae, Coelocrinidae,\r\n    Batocrinidae, Periechocrinidae.\r\n\r\n    Sub-order iii. _Actinocrinoidea._--RR separated by a hexagonal anal;\r\n    first brachial usually hexagonal. Families: Actinocrinidae,\r\n    Amphoracrinidae.\r\n\r\n  Sub-class II. _Dicyclica._--Crinoidea in which the base consists of BB\r\n  and IBB, the latter being liable to atrophy or fusion with the\r\n  proximale, but the aboral prolongations of the chambered organ are\r\n  always radial; new columnals may or may not be introduced at the\r\n  proximal end of the stem.\r\n\r\n  Order 1. _Dicyclica Inadunata._--Dicyclica in which the dorsal cup\r\n  primitively is confined to the patina and occasional intercalated\r\n  anals, and no other plates ever occur between RR (Grade: Distincta);\r\n  Br may be incorporated in the cup, with or without iBr, but never\r\n  rigidly, and their corresponding ambulacrals remain supra-tegminal\r\n  (Grade: Articulata); new columnals are introduced at the extreme\r\n  proximal end of the stem.\r\n\r\n    Sub-order i. _Cyathocrinoidea._--Tegmen stout with conspicuous\r\n    orals. Families: Carabocrinidae, Palaeocrinidae. Euspirocrinidae,\r\n    Sphaerocrinidae, Cyathocrinidae, Petalocrinidae, Crotalocrinidae,\r\n    Codiacrinidae, Cupressocrinidae, Gasterocomidae.\r\n\r\n    Sub-order ii. _Dendrocrinoidea._--Tegmen thin, flexible, with\r\n    inconspicuous orals. Families: Dendrocrinidae, Botryocrinidae,\r\n    Lophocrinidae, Scaphiocrinidae, Scytalecrinidae, Graphiocrinidae,\r\n    Cromyocrinidae, Encrinidae (preceding families are Distincta; the\r\n    rest Articulata), Pentacrinidae, including the recent _Isocrinus_\r\n    (fig. 14), Uintacrinidae, Marsupitidae, Bathycrinidae (recent).\r\n\r\n  Order 2. _Flexibilia._--Dicyclica in which proximal brachials are\r\n  incorporated in the dorsal cup, either by their own sides, or by\r\n  interbrachials, or by a finely plated skin, but never rigidly; plates\r\n  may occur between RR. Tegmen flexible, with distinct ambulacrals and\r\n  numerous small interambulacrals; mouth and food-grooves remain\r\n  supra-tegminal and open. Top columnal a persistent proximale, often\r\n  fusing with IBB, which are frequently atrophied in the adult.\r\n\r\n  All the Palaeozoic representatives have non-pinnulate arms, while the\r\n  Mesozoic and later forms have them pinnulate. There are other points\r\n  of difference, so that it is not certain whether the latter really\r\n  descended from the former. But assuming such a relationship we arrange\r\n  them in two grades.\r\n\r\n    Grade a. _Impinnata._--Families: Ichthyocrinidae, Sagenocrinidae,\r\n    and Taxocrinidae, perhaps capable of further division.\r\n\r\n    Grade b. _Pinnata._--Families: Apiocrinidae with the recent\r\n    _Calamocrinus_, Bourgueticrinidae with recent _Rhizocrinus_,\r\n    Antedonidae, Atelecrinidae, Actinometridae, Thaumatocrinidae (these\r\n    four recent families include free-moving forms with atrophied stem,\r\n    probably derived from different ancestors), Eugeniacrinidae,\r\n    Holopodidae (recent), Eudesicrinidae.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 14.--A living Pentacrinid, _Isocrinus asteria_;\r\n  the first specimen found, after Guettard's figure published in 1761.]\r\n\r\n  Order 3. _Dicyclica Camerata._--Dicyclica in which the first, and\r\n  usually the second, orders of brachials are incorporated in the dorsal\r\n  cup by interbrachials, at first loosely, but afterwards by close\r\n  suture. IBB always the primitive 5. An anal plate always rests on the\r\n  posterior basal; mouth and tegminal food-grooves closed; arms\r\n  pinnulate. Families: Reteocrinidae, Dimerocrinidae, Lampterocrinidae,\r\n  Rhodocrinidae, Cleiocrinidae.\r\n\r\n  Class IV. EDRIOASTEROIDEA.--Pelmatozoa in which the theca is composed\r\n  of an indefinite number of irregular plates, some of which are\r\n  variously differentiated in different genera; with no subvective\r\n  skeletal appendages, but with central mouth, from which there radiate\r\n  through the theca five unbranched ambulacra, composed of a double\r\n  series of alternating plates (covering-plates), sometimes supported by\r\n  an outer series of larger alternating plates (side-plates or\r\n  flooring-plates). In some forms at least, pores between (not through)\r\n  the ambulacral elements, or between them and the thecal plates, seem\r\n  to have permitted the passage of extensions from the perradial\r\n  water-vessels. Anus in posterior interradius, on oral surface, closed\r\n  by valvular pyramid. Hydropore (usually, if not always, present)\r\n  between mouth and anus. Families: Agelacrinidae, Cyathocystidae,\r\n  Edrioasteridae, Steganoblastidae. All Palaeozoic. The structure and\r\n  importance of _Edrioaster_ have been discussed above (figs. 11, 12).\r\n\r\n  Grade B. ELEUTHEROZOA--Echinoderma in which the theca, which may be\r\n  but slightly or not at all calcified, is not attached by any portion\r\n  of its surface, but is usually placed with the oral surface downwards\r\n  or in the direction of forward locomotion. Food is not conveyed by a\r\n  subvective system of ciliated grooves, but is taken in directly by the\r\n  mouth. The anus when present is typically aboral, and approaches the\r\n  mouth only in a few specialized forms. The aboral nervous system, if\r\n  indeed it be present at all, is very slightly developed. The\r\n  circumoesophageal water-ring may lose its connexion with the exterior\r\n  medium; the podia (absent only in some exceptional forms) may be\r\n  locomotor, respiratory or sensory in function, but usually are\r\n  locomotor tube-feet.\r\n\r\n  The classes of the Eleutherozoa probably arose independently from\r\n  different branches of the Pelmatozoan stem. The precise relation is\r\n  not clear, but the order in which they are here placed is believed to\r\n  be from the more primitive to the more specialized.\r\n\r\n  Class I. HOLOTHURIOIDEA.--Eleutherozoa normally elongate along the\r\n  oro-anal axis, which axis and the dorsal hydropore lie in the sagittal\r\n  plane of a secondary bilateral symmetry. The calcareous skeleton,\r\n  which may be entirely absent, is usually in the form of minute\r\n  spicules, sometimes of small irregular plates with no trace of a\r\n  calycinal or apical system; to these is added a ring of pieces\r\n  radiately arranged round the oesophagus. Ambulacral appendages take\r\n  the form of: (1) circumoral tentacles, (2) sucking-feet, (3) papillae;\r\n  of these (1) alone is always present. The gonads are not radiately\r\n  disposed.\r\n\r\n  The comparative anatomy of living forms, combined with the\r\n  evolutionary hypothesis sketched above, suggests that the early\r\n  holothurians possessed the following characters: subvective grooves\r\n  entirely closed; 5 radial canals, proceeding from the water-ring, gave\r\n  off branches furnished with ampullae to the podia on each side of\r\n  them, the 10 anterior podia being changed into cylindrical tentacles;\r\n  the transverse muscles of the body-wall formed a circular layer,\r\n  probably interrupted at the radii (though Ludwig believes the\r\n  contrary); longitudinal muscles as paired radial bands, without those\r\n  special retractors for withdrawing the anterior part of the body which\r\n  occur in many recent forms; a hydropore connected with the water-ring\r\n  by a canal in the dorsal mesentery; a gonopore behind the hydropore\r\n  connected by a single duct with a bunch of genital pouches on each\r\n  side of the mesentery; gut dextrally coiled, with a simple\r\n  blood-vascular system, and with an enlargement at the anus for\r\n  respiration, this eventually producing branched caeca called\r\n  \"respiratory trees\"; skeleton reduced to a ring of 5 radial and 5\r\n  interradial plates round the gullet, and small plates, with a\r\n  hexagonally meshed network, dispersed through the integument. Such a\r\n  form gave rise to descendants differing _inter se_ as regards the\r\n  suppression of the radial canals and of the podia, the form of the\r\n  tentacles, and the development of respiratory trees. These anatomical\r\n  facts are represented in the following classification by H. Ludwig:--\r\n\r\n  Order 1. _Actinopoda._--Radial canals supplying tentacles and podia.\r\n\r\n    A. With respiratory trees.\r\n                                    /Fam. 1, Holothuriidae.\r\n         (a) With podia            < Fam. 4, Cucumariidae.\r\n                                    \\Fam. 5, Molpadiidae.\r\n         (b) Without podia\r\n\r\n    B. Without respiratory trees.\r\n         (a) With podia              Fam. 2, Elpidiidae.\r\n         (b) Without podia           Fam. 3, Pelagothuriidae.\r\n\r\n  Order 2. _Paractinopoda._--Neither radial canals nor podia. Tentacles\r\n  supplied from circular canal. Fam. Synaptidae.\r\n\r\n  It is admitted, however, that this scheme does not represent the\r\n  probable descent or relationship of the families. Consideration of the\r\n  views of Ludwig himself, of H. Ostergren, and especially of R.\r\n  Perrier, suggests the following as a more natural if less obvious\r\n  arrangement.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 15.--An Aspidochirote Holothurian of the family\r\n  _Holothuriidae_, showing the mouth surrounded by tentacles, the anus\r\n  at the other end of the body, and three of the rows of podia.]\r\n\r\n  Order 1. _Aspidochirota._--Tentacles more or less peltate; calcareous\r\n  ring when present simple and radially symmetrical; no retractors;\r\n  stone-canal often opens to exterior; genital tubes sometimes\r\n  restricted to left side in consequence of altered position of gut\r\n  (Fig. 15.) Families: Elpidiidae (deep-sea forms, with sub-famm.\r\n  Synallactinae, Deimatinae, Elpidiinae, Psychropotinae), Holothuriidae\r\n  (shallow water), Pelagothuriidae (pelagic).\r\n\r\n  Order 2. _Dendrochirota._--Tentacles simple or branched, never\r\n  peltate; calcareous ring well developed, often bilaterally\r\n  symmetrical; retractor muscles usually present; stone-canal opens\r\n  internally; genital tubes in right and left tufts.\r\n\r\n    Sub-order i. _Apoda._--No tube-feet or papillae, but tentacular\r\n    ampullae more or less developed. Mostly burrowers. Families:\r\n    Synaptidae (sub-famm. Synaptinae, Chirodotinae, Myriotrochinae),\r\n    Molpadiidae.\r\n\r\n    Sub-order ii. _Eupoda._--Tube-feet present, but tentacular ampullae\r\n    rudimentary or absent. Families: Cucumariidae (climbers and\r\n    crawlers), Rhopalodinidae (burrowers).\r\n\r\n  Class II. STELLIFORMIA (= ASTEROIDEA _sensu lato_).--Eleutherozoa with\r\n  a depressed stellate body composed of a central disk, whence radiate\r\n  five or more rays; this radiate symmetry affects all the systems of\r\n  organs, including the genital. The radial water-vessels lie in grooves\r\n  on the ventral side of flooring-plates (usually called \"ambulacrals\");\r\n  they and their podia are limited to the oral surface of the body and\r\n  their extremities are separated from the apical plates by a stretch\r\n  of dorsal integument containing skeletal elements; the opening of the\r\n  water-vascular system (madreporite) is not connected with a definite\r\n  apical plate or system of plates.\r\n\r\n  The starfish, brittle-stars and their allies (see STARFISH) have for\r\n  the last fifty years usually been divided into two classes--Asteroidea\r\n  and Ophiuroidea, each equivalent to the Holothurioidea or Echinoidea.\r\n  Recently, however, some authors, e.g. Gregory, have attempted to show\r\n  that these classes cannot be distinguished. It is true that some\r\n  specialized forms, such as the _Brisingidae_ among starfish,\r\n  _Astrophiura_ and _Ophioteresis_ among ophiurans, contravene the usual\r\n  diagnoses; but this neither obscures their systematic position, nor\r\n  does it alter the fact that since early Palaeozoic times these two\r\n  great groups of stellate echinoderms have evolved along separate\r\n  lines. If then we place these groups in a single class, it is not on\r\n  account of a few anomalous genera, but because the characters set\r\n  forth above sharply distinguish them from all other echinoderms, and\r\n  because we have good reason to believe that the ophiurans did not\r\n  arise independently but have descended from primitive starfish. For\r\n  that class Bell's name Stelliformia is selected since it avoids both\r\n  confusion and barbarism.\r\n\r\n  Sub-class I. _Asterida._--Stelliformia in which the ambulacral groove\r\n  always remains open and the podia serve as tube-feet (fig. 12, B); the\r\n  rays as a rule pass gradually into the disk, and contain both genital\r\n  glands and caecal extensions of the digestive system; an anus usually\r\n  present; respiration is by tubular extensions from the body-cavity\r\n  (papulae); skeletal appendages, in addition to small spines, are\r\n  either small grasping organs (pedicellariae), or clumped spines\r\n  (paxillae), or branched spines bearing a membrane.\r\n\r\n  No existing classification of the Asterida is satisfactory even for\r\n  the recent forms, still less when the older fossils are considered. A\r\n  separation of the latter as Palasterida, because of their alternating\r\n  ambulacrals, from the recent Euasterida with opposite ambulacrals, is\r\n  now discarded and an attempt made to arrange the Palasterida in\r\n  divisions originally established for Euasterida. Those divisions fall\r\n  under three schemes. C. Viguier has divided the starfish into:\r\n  _Asteries ambulacraires_, with plates of ambulacral origin prominent\r\n  in the mouth-skeleton, pedicellariae stalked, and straight or crossed,\r\n  podial pores usually quadriserial; _Asteries adambulacraires_, with\r\n  adambulacrals prominent in the mouth-skeleton, pedicellariae sessile,\r\n  and forcipiform or valvular, podial pores usually biserial. Perrier,\r\n  at first laying greater stress on the nature of the pedicellariae and\r\n  afterwards on the form of the mouth-skeleton, has gradually perfected\r\n  a scheme of five orders: (1) _Forcipulata_, with pedicellariae\r\n  stalked, and straight or crossed; (2) _Spinulosa_, with pedicellariae\r\n  sessile and forcipiform; (3) _Velata_, with membraniferous spines; (4)\r\n  _Paxillosa_, pedicellariae represented by an ossicle of the test and\r\n  the spines covering it, the whole forming a paxilla; (5) _Valvata_ or\r\n  _Granulosa_, with pedicellariae sessile and valvular or salt-cellar\r\n  shaped. A more widely accepted scheme is that of W.P. Sladen, who\r\n  divided the Euasterida into two orders; (1) _Phanerozonia_, with\r\n  marginals large and highly developed, the supero-marginals and\r\n  infero-marginals contiguous, with papulae confined to the dorsal\r\n  surface, with ambulacrals well spaced and usually broad, adambulacrals\r\n  prominent in the mouth-skeleton, with pedicellariae sessile; (2)\r\n  _Cryptozonia_, with marginals inconspicuous and somewhat atrophied in\r\n  the adult, the supero-marginals separated from the infero-marginals by\r\n  intercalated plates, with papulae distributed over the whole body,\r\n  with ambulacrals crowded and narrow, either ambulacrals or\r\n  adambulacrals prominent in the mouth-skeleton, with pedicellariae\r\n  stalked or sessile.\r\n\r\n  We give here a list of the families separated into Sladen's orders and\r\n  grouped under Perrier's divisions, extinct families being marked [+].\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 16.--Section across the arm-skeleton of a\r\n  Phanerozonate Asterid, _Astropecten_.\r\n\r\n    a, Ambulacral plates.\r\n    b, Adambulacral plates.\r\n    c and d, Inferior and superior lateral plates.\r\n    e, Dorsal plates with paxillae.

The following scheme is based on the attempts\r\n  of E. Haeckel, F.J. Bell, J.W. Gregory, B. Sturtz, J.O.E. Perrier, and\r\n  A.E. Verrill. Extinct families marked [+].\r\n\r\n  Grade A. _Palophiurae._--Ambulacrals not yet forming complete\r\n  vertebrae; plates of disk not yet specialized into mouth, radial or\r\n  genital shields.\r\n\r\n    Stage a. _Allostichia_ (= Lysophiurae).--Ambulacrals alternating and\r\n    unfused, groove uncovered by ventral arm-plates. Families: [+]\r\n    Protasteridae, [+] Protophiuridae.\r\n\r\n    Stage b. _Zygostichia._--Ambulacrals opposite and, except in\r\n    Ophiurinidae, fused; ventral arm-plates developed in some.

Families: [+] Onychasteridae, Ophiohelidae,\r\n  Ophioscolecidae, Ophiomyxidae, Hemieuryalidae, Astrophiuridae;\r\n  unclassified genera, e.g. _Ophioteresis_, _Ophiosciasma_,\r\n  _Ophiogeron_.\r\n\r\n  Order 2. _Zygophiurae._--Rays simple and prevented from coiling by\r\n  processes on the vertebral joints (fig. 18); dorsal, ventral and\r\n  lateral arm-plates present.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 18.--A vertebral arm-ossicle (fused ambulacrals)\r\n  of a Zygophiuran, _Ophiolepis_.\r\n\r\n    A, Proximal joint-face.\r\n    B, Distal joint-face.\r\n    c, Ventral groove, where lies the water-vessel, from which branches\r\n      pass through the ossicle, emerging as podia at e and e.]\r\n\r\n    Sub-order i. _Brachyophiurae._--Spines short, simple, pointing\r\n    towards the end of the arm. Families: Pectinuridae (=\r\n    Ophiodermatidae), Ophiolepididae.\r\n\r\n    Sub-order ii. _Nectophiurae._--Spines may be variously elaborated\r\n    and are set more at right angles to the arm-axis. Families:\r\n    Amphiuridae, Ophiacanthidae, Ophiocomidae, Ophiothrichidae.\r\n\r\n  Order 3. _Cladophiurae_ (= Euryalae). Rays simple or branched, capable\r\n  of coiling, since the vertebrae articulate by surfaces of hour-glass\r\n  shape; ventral arm-plates, and often the others, much reduced; spines\r\n  reduced or absent. Families: Euryalidae, Gorgonocephalidae,\r\n  Astrochelidae, Astroschemidae, Astronycidae.\r\n\r\n  The Silurian genera _Eucladia_ and _Euthemon_ have the rays greatly\r\n  reduced and merged in the disk, so that the ambulacrals are unseen.\r\n  There are a few large dorsal, lateral and ventral arm-plates, and at\r\n  the angles of the latter emerge huge podia with a granular or plated\r\n  skin. There are five prominent mouth-shields and a separate\r\n  madreporite on the ventral surface. These genera attained the\r\n  Colophiuran grade in respect of external plating, but it is unlikely\r\n  that they or their ancestors had acquired even the Streptophiuran\r\n  type of vertebra. Sollas has separated them as an order _Ophiocistia_.\r\n\r\n  Class III. ECHINOIDEA.--Eleutherozoa with a test of roughly circular,\r\n  subpentagonal or elliptical outline, spheroidal, domed or flattened,\r\n  of primary pentameric symmetry affecting all systems of organs except\r\n  the gut. The radial water-vessels lie within the test through which\r\n  their podia pass (fig. 12, D); the ambulacra thus formed are\r\n  continuous from the peristome to the apical system of plates; the\r\n  hydropore is connected with a definite plate of that system, and thus\r\n  marks a secondary bilateral symmetry. An anus is present either within\r\n  the apical system (endocyclic, fig. 3, A and B), or outside it in an\r\n  interradius (exocyclic, fig. 19, 7), thus initiating yet another\r\n  bilateral symmetry. Skeletal appendages are spines (radioles),\r\n  pedicellariae, and, in some forms, minute sense-organs called\r\n  sphaeridia.\r\n\r\n  The echinoids or sea-archins (see SEA-URCHIN) may be grouped under the\r\n  following orders, here named in the sequence of their appearance in\r\n  the rocks.\r\n\r\n  Order 1. _Bothriocidaroida._--Ambulacrals simple, each with two pores\r\n  vertically superposed, 2 columns to each ambulacrum; interambulacrals\r\n  multi-tuberculate, in 1 column, none passing on to or resorbed by the\r\n  peristome; mouth central, jaws unknown, no external gills or\r\n  sphaeridia; anus aboral, endocyclic. Sole genus _Bothriocidaris_ (fig.\r\n  5), Ordovician.\r\n\r\n  Order 2. _Melonitoida._--Ambulacrals simple, each with two pores\r\n  horizontally juxtaposed, in 2 to 18 columns; interambulacrals\r\n  granulate with occasional tubercles, in 3 to 11 columns, not more than\r\n  one row passing on to the peristome; mouth central, with jaws, no\r\n  external gills or sphaeridia; anus aboral, endocyclic. Families:\r\n  Palechinidae (fig. 19, 1), Melonitidae and Lepidesthidae, Silurian to\r\n  Carboniferous.\r\n\r\n  Order 3. _Cystocidaroida._--Ambulacrals simple, each with one or two\r\n  pores, which sometimes pass between rather than through the plates, in\r\n  2 columns; interambulacrals, uni- or multi-tuberculate, in numerous\r\n  (say 10 or more) columns, none passing on to peristome; mouth central\r\n  with jaws, no external gills or sphaeridia; position of anus doubtful,\r\n  acyclic, i.e. no apical system so far as known. Include only\r\n  _Echinocystis_, _Palaeodiscus_ and (?) _Myriastiches_, all Upper\r\n  Silurian.\r\n\r\n  Order 4. _Cidaroida._--Ambulacrals simple, each with two pores\r\n  horizontally juxtaposed, in 2 columns; interambulacrals\r\n  unituberculate, in 2 to 11 columns, some rows may pass on to the\r\n  peristome; mouth central, with jaws, no external gills or sphaeridia;\r\n  anus aboral, endocyclic. Families: Lepidocentridae and\r\n  Archaeocidaridae (fig. 19, 2), Devonian and Carboniferous; Cidaridae\r\n  (fig. 19, 3, 4). Permian to present; Diplocidaridae and Tiarechinidae,\r\n  Mesozoic.\r\n\r\n  Order 5. _Diademoida._--Ambulacrals generally compound, with two pores\r\n  obliquely juxtaposed, in 2 columns as in all subsequent orders;\r\n  interambulacrals usually with large radioles surrounded by smaller\r\n  ones, as in Cidaroida, in 2 columns as in all subsequent orders, only\r\n  one plate resorbed; mouth central, with jaws and external gills,\r\n  sphaeridia present; anus aboral endocyclic. J.W. Gregory divides this\r\n  into four suborders, each representing a distinct evolutionary series;\r\n  i. _Calycina_, Saleniidae (fig. 19, 5) and Acrosaleniidae; ii.\r\n  _Arbacina_, Hemicidaridae and Arbaciidae; iii. _Diademina_,\r\n  Orthopsidae, Diadematidae, Diplopodiidae, Pedinidae, Cyphosomatidae,\r\n  and Echinothuridae; iv. _Echinina_, Temnopleuridae, Triplechinidae,\r\n  Strongylocentrotidae and Echinometridae. The order is Triassic to\r\n  Recent.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 19.--Denuded tests of some fossil Echinoids.\r\n\r\n    1, _Palaeechinus_; Carboniferous.\r\n    2, A plate and radiole of _Archaeocidaris_; Carboniferous.\r\n    3, A radiole of _Cidaris_; Jurassic.\r\n    4, _Hemicidaris_; Mid.

Families: Pygasteridae, Discoidiidae,\r\n  Galeritidae, Conoclypeidae; Jurassic to Recent.\r\n\r\n  Order 7. _Spatangoida._--Ambulacrals simple, with two pores\r\n  juxtaposed, dorsal podia respiratory; interambulacrals bearing\r\n  numerous small spines, none resorbed; mouth central or shifted\r\n  forwards, with no jaws or external gills, sphaeridia numerous; anus\r\n  exocyclic. As the mouth moves forward and the anus downward, the\r\n  posterior interambulacrals between them are enlarged and strengthened\r\n  so as to form a sternum.

Here the Cystocidaroida occupy an isolated position. It is,\r\n  however, quite possible that _Echinocystis_ may some day be referred\r\n  to the Cidaroida, and _Palaeodiscus_ to the Melonitoida. This would\r\n  leave the Echinoid scheme remarkably simple, with the Melonitoida and\r\n  Cidaroida as divergent branches from an ancestor like\r\n  _Bothriocidaris_; but while the former branch soon decayed, the latter\r\n  continues to flourish at the present day. To take the Echinoidea now\r\n  living, and to divide them into Endocyclica and Exocyclica, Branchiate\r\n  and Abranchiate, Gnathostomata and Atelostomata, is easy and\r\n  convenient; or again to distinguish as Palechinoidea those\r\n  pre-Jurassic genera which do not conform to the fixed type of twenty\r\n  vertical columns found in the later Euechinoidea, is to express an\r\n  interesting fact; but all such divisions obscure the true\r\n  relationships, and the corresponding terms should be recognized as\r\n  descriptive rather than classificatory.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--In addition to the works referred to at the beginning of\r\n  the article, the following deal with the general subject: Bather,\r\n  Gregory and Goodrich, \"Echinoderma,\" in Lankester's _Treatise on\r\n  Zoology_ (London, 1900); F.J.

A. B.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] Sometimes called \"Echinodermata,\" a Greek name meaning\r\n    \"sea-urchin-skins,\" which was invented by J.T. Klein (1734) to denote\r\n    the tests of the Echini or sea-urchins; its later use for the animals\r\n    themselves, or for the whole phylum, was an error in both history and\r\n    etymology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nECHINUS (Gr. for \"hedge-hog\" or \"sea-urchin\"), in architecture, the\r\nconvex moulding which supports the abacus of the Doric column. The term\r\nis sometimes given to the _ovolo_ of the Ionic capital, especially when\r\ncurved with the egg-and-tongue enrichment. The origin of this use of the\r\nword in architecture, which comes down from ancient times, is uncertain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nECHIUROIDEA (Gr. [Greek: echis], adder, and [Greek: oura], tail), the\r\nzoological name for a small group of marine animals which show in their\r\nlarval life-history a certain degree of segmentation, and are therefore\r\ngrouped by some authorities as Annelids. Formerly, together with the\r\nSipunculoidea and Priapuloidea, they made up the class Gephyrea, but on\r\nthe ground that they retain in the adult a large preoral lobe (the\r\nproboscis), that they have anal vesicles, that their anus is terminal,\r\nthat setae are found, and finally that they are segmented in the larval\r\nstage, they have been removed from the class, which by the proposed\r\nfurther separation of the Priapuloidea on account of their unique renal\r\nand reproductive organs, has practically ceased to exist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--A, _Bonellia viridis_, Rol., [female]; B, B.\r\n_fuliginosa_. Both natural size. a, grooved proboscis; b, mouth; c,\r\nventral hooks; d, anus.]\r\n\r\nEchiuroids are animals of moderate size, varying roughly from one to six\r\nor seven centimetres in length, exclusive of the proboscis. This organ\r\nis capable of very considerable extension, and may attain a length in\r\n_Bonellia viridis_ of about a metre and a half (fig. 1). It is grooved\r\nventrally and ciliated. At its attachment to the body the groove sinks\r\ninto the mouth. In _Bonellia_ the proboscis is forked at its free end,\r\nbut in the other genera it is short and unforked. The body is somewhat\r\nsausage-shaped, with the anus at the posterior extremity, surrounded in\r\n_Echiurus_ by a single or double ring of setae. The skin is usually\r\nwrinkled, and in _B. viridis_, _Thalassema lankesteri_, _Th. baronii_,\r\n_Hamingia arctica_, and in the larva of many species, is of a lively\r\ngreen colour. A pair of curved bristles, formed in true setal sacs as in\r\nChaetopoda, project from the body a short distance behind the mouth, and\r\nare moved by special muscles; they are of use in helping the animal to\r\nmove slowly about, and they take a large share in the burrowing\r\nmovements (C.B. Wilson, _Biol. Bull._, 1900), for some species tunnel in\r\nthe mud and sand and form more or less permanent burrows, the walls of\r\nwhich are strengthened by mucus secreted from the skin. The openings of\r\nthe burrows become silted up, leaving, however, a small aperture through\r\nwhich the proboscis is extruded. This organ carefully searches the\r\nneighbourhood for particles of food. When these are found the grooved\r\nproboscis folds its walls inwards, and the cilia pass the particles down\r\nthe tube thus formed to the mouth. Echiuroids also move by extending the\r\nproboscis, which takes hold of some fixed object, and, then contracting,\r\ndraws the body forwards. Recently it has been shown that _Echiurus_\r\nswims freely at night-time, using for locomotion both the proboscis and\r\nthe contraction of the muscles of its body-wall. The motion is described\r\nas \"gyratory,\" and the anterior end is always carried foremost. Those\r\nspecies which do not burrow usually conceal themselves in crevices of\r\nthe rocks or under stones, or at times in empty Mollusc or Echinid\r\nshells. They are occasionally used by fishermen for bait.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--Female _Bonellia viridis_, Rol.

Beneath the epidermis is a layer of\r\n  circular muscles, then a layer of longitudinal, and finally in some\r\n  cases a layer of oblique muscle-fibres. The inner face of this\r\n  muscular skin is lined by a layer of epithelium. The coelomic\r\n  body-cavity is spacious. It does not extend into the proboscis, which\r\n  is a solid organ traversed by the nervous and vascular rings, but\r\n  otherwise largely built up of muscle fibres and connective tissue.\r\n  Many sense-cells lie in the epidermis. The ciliated ventral groove of\r\n  the proboscis leads at its base into the simple mouth, which gives\r\n  access to the thin-walled alimentary canal. This is longer than the\r\n  body, and to tuck it away it is looped from side to side. The loops\r\n  are supported by strands of connective tissue, which in some species\r\n  are united so as to form a dorsal mesentery, whilst traces of a\r\n  ventral mesentery are met with anteriorly and posteriorly (H.L.\r\n  Jameson, _Zool. Jahrb. Anat._, 1899). The alimentary canal is\r\n  divisible into fore-gut, mid-gut and hind-gut, and the first-named can\r\n  be further divided into pharynx, oesophagus, gizzard and crop, mainly\r\n  on histological grounds. The mid-gut is characterized by the presence\r\n  of a ciliated groove, from which arises the collateral intestine or\r\n  siphon, a second tube which rejoins the alimentary canal lower down.\r\n  Similar collateral intestines are familiar in the Echinids and certain\r\n  Polychaets (Capitellidae). The rectum receives the openings of a pair\r\n  of very characteristic organs, the anal vesicles. Each consists of a\r\n  branching tube, the tips of whose twigs terminate in minute ciliated\r\n  funnels. The anal vesicles are thought to be excretory; whether this\r\n  be so or not, they undoubtedly have some influence on the amount of\r\n  fluid found in the coelom. The coelomic fluid contains as a rule both\r\n  amoeboid and rounded corpuscles, and, when ripe, the products of the\r\n  gonads. A closed system of vessels, usually called the vascular\r\n  system, is present. There are, however, no capillaries connected with\r\n  this, and it is confined to certain portions of the body. It can\r\n  possess few of the functions usually associated with a vascular\r\n  system, and its main use is probably to assist in the expansion of the\r\n  proboscis. The system consists of the following parts:--A dorsal\r\n  vessel applied to the alimentary canal is continued anteriorly into a\r\n  median vessel, which traverses the proboscis to its tip. Here the\r\n  vessel splits, and each half returns along the lateral edge of the\r\n  proboscis; they reunite around the oesophagus and form a single\r\n  ventral vessel, which lies above the ventral nerve-cord. The ventral\r\n  vessel, which ends solidly behind, sends off a branch which forms a\r\n  ring around the intestine and opens into the posterior extremity of\r\n  the dorsal vessel. In _Echiurus_ and _Thalassema_ the same vessel\r\n  forms a ring round a stout muscle, which connects the bases of the two\r\n  ventral setae before passing to surround the intestine. Amoeboid\r\n  corpuscles float in the fluid contents. The nephridia vary in number\r\n  from a single one in _Bonellia_ to three pairs in many species of\r\n  _Thalassema_. Their external openings are ventral, and on the same\r\n  level as the ciliated funnel-shaped nephrostomes. The posterior wall\r\n  of the organ is produced into a long blind sac, which is lined by\r\n  secretory cells. The nervous system is a single ventral cord, which\r\n  starts from a circumoesophageal ring. This ring is involved in the\r\n  growth of the proboscis, and is drawn out with it. Thus there is a\r\n  lateral nerve near each edge of the proboscis which unites with its\r\n  fellow dorsally above the oesophagus at the tip of the proboscis, and\r\n  ventrally beneath the oesophagus, where they fuse to form the ventral\r\n  nerve-cord. There are no specialized ganglia, but ganglion-cells are\r\n  scattered uniformly along the nerve-cords. The ventral cord gives off\r\n  rings, which run into the skin at regular intervals. The reproductive\r\n  cells are modified coelomic cells, which lie on the ventral vessel.\r\n  They escape into the coelomic fluid and there develop. When mature\r\n  they leave the body through the nephridia. _Bonellia_ and _Hamingia_\r\n  are very interesting examples of sexual dimorphism. The female has the\r\n  normal Echiuroid structure, but the male is reduced to a minute,\r\n  flattened, planarian-like organism, which passes its life usually in\r\n  the company of two or three others in a special recess of the\r\n  nephridia of the female. Its structure may be gathered by a reference\r\n  to fig. 3.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 3.--Adult male, _Bonellia viridis_, Rol. The\r\n  original was 1.5 mm. long. The nervous system is not shown.

The preoral lobe persists as\r\n  the proboscis. The sexes of the larvae are not determinable in the\r\n  early stages, but when a certain growth has been reached in Bonellia\r\n  the males seek the proboscis of the adult females, and passing into\r\n  the mouth undergo there the transformation into the planarian-like\r\n  parasite which is the fully-formed male. This now creeps along the\r\n  body of the female and takes up its home in her nephridia.\r\n\r\n_Classification and Distribution._--The Echiuroidea consists of the\r\nfollowing genera:--(1) _Bonellia_ (Rol.), with four species, widely\r\ndistributed, but inhabiting the temperate and warmer waters of each\r\nhemisphere. (2) _Echiurus_ (Guerin-Meneville), with four species. This\r\ngenus reaches from the Arctic waters of both hemispheres into the cooler\r\ntemperate regions. (3) _Hamingia_ (Kor. and Dan.), with one species,\r\nwhich has been taken in the Arctic Sea and the Hardanger Fjord. (4)\r\n_Saccosoma_ (Kor. and Dan.) was described from a single specimen dredged\r\nabout half-way between Iceland and Norway. (5) _Thalassema_ (Gaertner,\r\nLamarck), with twenty-one species. This genus is in the main a denizen\r\nof the warmer waters of the globe. Sixteen species are found only in\r\ntropical or subtropical seas, three species are Mediterranean (_Mt.\r\nStat. Neapel_, 1899), whilst three species are from the eastern\r\nAtlantic, where the temperature is modified by the Gulf Stream (Shipley;\r\nsee Willey's _Zoological Results_, part iii. 1899; _Proc. Zool. Soc.\r\nLond._, 1898, 1899; and _Cambridge Natural History_, ii.). The following\r\nare found in the British area:--_E. pallasii_ (Guerin-Meneville), _Th.\r\nneptuni_ (Gaertner), and _Th. lankesteri_ (Herdman, _Q.J.M.S._, 1898).\r\n\r\n_Affinities._--The occurrence of trochosphere larva and the temporary\r\nsegmentation of the body have led to the belief that the Echiuroids are\r\nmore nearly allied to the Annelids than to any other phylum. This view\r\nis strengthened by certain anatomical and histological resemblances to\r\nthe genus _Sternaspis_, which in one species, _S. spinosa_, is said to\r\ncarry a bifid proboscis resembling that of the Echiuroids.\r\n     (A. E. S.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nECHMIADZIN, or ITSMIADSIN, a monastery of Russian Transcaucasia, in the\r\ngovernment of Erivan, the seat of the Catholicus or primate of the\r\nArmenian church. It is situated close to the village of Vagarshapat, in\r\nthe plain of the Aras, 2840 ft. above the sea, 12 m. W. of Erivan and 40\r\nN. of Mount Ararat. The monastery comprises a pretty extensive complex\r\nof buildings, and is surrounded by brick walls 30 ft. high, which with\r\ntheir loopholes and towers present the appearance of a fortress. Its\r\narchitectural character has been considerably impaired by additions and\r\nalterations in modern Russian style. On the western side of the\r\nquadrangle is the residence of the primate, on the south the refectory\r\n(1730-1735), on the east the lodgings for the monks, and on the north\r\nthe cells. The cathedral is a small but fine cruciform building with a\r\nByzantine cupola at the intersection. Its foundation is ascribed to St\r\nGregory the Illuminator in 302. Of special interest is the porch, built\r\nof red porphyry, and profusely adorned with sculptured designs somewhat\r\nof a Gothic character. The interior is decorated with Persian frescoes\r\nof flowers, birds and scroll-work. It is here that the Catholicus\r\nconfers episcopal consecration by the sacred hand (relic) of St Gregory;\r\nand here every seven years he prepares with great solemnity the holy oil\r\nwhich is to be used throughout the churches of the Armenian communion.\r\nOutside of the main entrance are the alabaster tombs of the primates\r\nAlexander I. (1714), Alexander II. (1755), Daniel (1806) and Narses\r\n(1857), and a white marble monument, erected by the English East India\r\nCompany to mark the resting-place of Sir John Macdonald Kinneir, who\r\ndied at Tabriz in 1830, while on an embassy to the Persian court. The\r\nlibrary of the monastery is a rich storehouse of Armenian literature\r\n(see Brosset's _Catalogue de la bibliotheque d'Etchmiadzin_, St\r\nPetersburg, 1840). Among the more remarkable manuscripts are a copy of\r\nthe gospels dating from the 10th or 11th century, and three bibles of\r\nthe 13th century. A type-foundry, a printing-press and a bookbinding\r\nestablishment are maintained by the monks who supply religious and\r\neducational works for their co-religionists.\r\n\r\nTo the east of the monastery is a modern college and seminary. Half a\r\nmile to the east stand the churches of St Ripsime and St Gaiana, two of\r\nthe early martyrs of Armenian Christianity; the latter is the\r\nburial-place of those primates who are not deemed worthy of interment\r\nbeside the cathedral. From a distance the three churches form a fairly\r\nstriking group, and accordingly the Turkish name for Echmiadzin is\r\nUch-Kilissi, or the Three Churches. The town of Vagarshapat dates from\r\nthe 6th century B.C.; it takes its name from King Vagarsh (Vologaeses),\r\nwho in the 2nd century A.D. chose it as his residence and surrounded it\r\nwith walls. Here the apostle of Armenia, St Gregory the Illuminator,\r\nerected a church in 309 and with it the primacy was associated. In 344\r\nVagarshapat ceased to be the Armenian capital, and in the 5th century\r\nthe patriarchal seat was removed to Dvin, and then to Ani. The monastery\r\nwas founded by Narses II., who ruled 524-533; and a restoration was\r\neffected in 618. The present name of the monastery was adopted instead\r\nof Vagarshapat in the 10th century. At length in 1441 the primate George\r\nbrought back the see to the original site.     (P. A. K.; J. T. Be.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nECHO (Gr.

She was beloved by Pan, but rejected his advances.\r\nThereupon the angry god drove the shepherds of the district mad; they\r\ntore Echo in pieces, and scattered her limbs broadcast, which still\r\nretained the gift of song (Longus iii. 23). According to Ovid (_Metam._\r\niii. 356-401), Echo by her incessant talking having prevented Juno from\r\nsurprising Jupiter with the Nymphs, Juno changed her into an \"echo\"--a\r\nbeing who could not speak till she was spoken to, and then could only\r\nrepeat the last words of the speaker. While in this condition she fell\r\nin love with Narcissus, and in grief at her unrequited affection wasted\r\naway until nothing remained but her voice and bones, which were changed\r\ninto rocks. The legends of Echo are of late, probably Alexandrian,\r\norigin, and she is first personified in Euripides.\r\n\r\nIn acoustics an \"echo\" is a return of sound from a reflecting surface\r\n(see SOUND: _Reflection_).\r\n\r\n  See F. Wieseler, _Die Nymphe Echo_ (1854), and _Narkissos_ (1856); P.\r\n  Decharme in Daremberg and Saglio's _Dictionnaire des antiquites_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nECHTERNACH, a town in the grand duchy of Luxemburg, on the Sure, close\r\nto the Prussian frontier. Pop. (1905) 3484. It is the oldest town in\r\nLuxemburg, and was the centre from which the English Saint Willibrord\r\nconverted the people to Christianity in the 7th century. There are the\r\nBenedictine abbey, the hospital almshouse, which is said to be the\r\noldest hospital in Europe except the Hotel-Dieu in Paris, and the church\r\nof St Peter and St Paul. The Benedictine abbey has been greatly shorn of\r\nits original dimensions, but the basilica remains a fair monument of\r\nRomano-Gothic art. The church of St Peter and St Paul stands on an\r\nisolated mound, and for the ascent sixty steps have been built in the\r\nside, and these are well worn by the tread of numerous pilgrims who come\r\nin each succeeding year. The interior of the church is curious more than\r\nimposing, and is specially noteworthy only for its gloom. Under the\r\naltar, and below a white marble effigy of himself, lies Saint\r\nWillibrord.\r\n\r\nEchternach is famous, however, in particular for the dancing procession\r\nheld on Whit-Tuesday every year. The origin of this festival is\r\nuncertain, but it dates at least from the 13th century and was probably\r\ninstituted during an outbreak of cholera. Nowadays it is an occasion of\r\npilgrimage, among Germans and Belgians as well as Luxemburgers, for all\r\nsick persons, but especially for the epileptic and those suffering from\r\nSt Vitus' dance. The ceremony is interesting, and the Roman Catholic\r\nChurch lends all its ritual to make it more imposing. The archbishop of\r\nTrier attends to represent Germany, and the bishop of Luxemburg figures\r\nfor the grand duchy. There is a religious ceremony on the Prussian side\r\nof the bridge over the Sure, and when it is over the congregation cross\r\ninto the duchy to join the procession, partly religious, partly popular,\r\nthrough the streets of the town. The religious procession, carrying\r\ncross and banners and attended by three hundred singers, comes first,\r\nchanting St Willibrord's hymn. Next comes a band of miscellaneous\r\ninstruments playing as a rule the old German air \"Adam had seven sons,\"\r\nand then follow the dancers. Many of these are young and full of life\r\nand health and dance for amusement, but many others are old or feeble\r\nand dance in the hope of recovery or of escaping from some trouble, but\r\non all alike the conditions of the dance are incumbent. There are three\r\nsteps forward and two back; five steps are thus taken to make one in\r\nadvance. This becomes especially trying at the flight of steps mounting\r\nto the little church where the procession ends in front of the shrine of\r\nthe great saint. There are sixty steps, but it takes three hundred to\r\nreach the top for the final time. It is said that those who fall from\r\nage or weariness have to be dragged out of the way by onlookers or they\r\nwould be trampled to death by the succeeding waves of dancers. The\r\nprocession, although it covers a distance of less than a mile, is said\r\nto take as much as five hours in its accomplishment. In olden days the\r\nabbey was the goal of the procession, and King William I. of the\r\nNetherlands--great-grandfather of Queen Wilhelmina--changed the day from\r\nTuesday to Sunday so that a working day should not be lost. This reform\r\ndid not answer, and the ancient order was restored. Some critics see in\r\nthe dancing procession of Echternach merely the survival of the spring\r\ndance of the heathen races, but at any rate it invests the little town\r\nwith an interest and importance that would otherwise be lacking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nECHUCA, a borough of the county of Rodney, Victoria, Australia, 156 m.\r\nby rail N. of Melbourne. Pop. (1901) 4075. It is situated on the river\r\nMurray, across which it is connected by bridge with Moama, on the New\r\nSouth Wales side, whence a railway runs to Deniliquin. The town is the\r\nterminus of the Murray River railway and the entrepot of the overland\r\nintercolonial trade; it has large wool stores, saw-mills, coach\r\nfactories, breweries and soap-works. The rich agricultural district is\r\nnoted for its vineyards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nECIJA, a town of southern Spain, in the province of Seville; on the\r\nCadiz-Cordova railway and the left bank of the river Genil. Pop. (1900)\r\n24,372. The river, thus far navigable, is here crossed by a fine old\r\nbridge; and the antiquity of the town betrays itself by the irregularity\r\nof its arrangement, by its walls and gateways, and by its numerous\r\ninscriptions and other relics. Its chief buildings include no fewer than\r\ntwenty convents, mostly secularized. The principal square is surrounded\r\nwith pillared porticoes, and has a fountain in the centre; and along the\r\nriver bank there runs a fine promenade, planted with poplar trees and\r\nadorned with statues. From an early period the shoemakers of Ecija have\r\nbeen in high repute throughout Spain; woollen cloth, flannel, linen and\r\nsilks are also manufactured. The vicinity is fertile in corn and wine,\r\nand cotton is cultivated. The heat is so great that the spot has\r\nacquired the sobriquet of _El Sarten_, or the \"Frying-pan\" of Andalusia.\r\nEcija, called _Estija_ by the Arabs, is the ancient _Astigis_, which was\r\nraised to the rank of a Roman colony with the title of _Augusta Firma_.\r\nAccording to Pliny and Pomponius Mela, who both wrote in the 1st century\r\nA.D., it was the rival of Cordova and Seville. If local tradition may be\r\nbelieved, it was visited by the apostle Paul, who converted his hostess\r\nSanta Xantippa; and, according to one version of his life, it was the\r\nsee of the famous St Crispin (q.v.) in the 3rd century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nECK, JOHANN MAIER (1486-1543), German theologian, the most indefatigable\r\nand important opponent of Martin Luther, was born on the 13th of\r\nNovember 1486 at Eck in Swabia, from which place he derived his\r\nadditional surname, which he himself, after 1505, always modified into\r\nEckius or Eccius, i.e. \"of Eck.\" His father, Michael Maier, was a\r\npeasant and bailiff (_Amtmann_) of the village. The boy's education was\r\nundertaken by his uncle Martin Maier, parish priest at Rothenburg on the\r\nNeckar, who sent him at the age of twelve to the university of\r\nHeidelberg, and subsequently to those of Tubingen, Cologne and Freiburg\r\nin the Breisgau. His academic career was so rapidly successful that at\r\nthe age of twenty-four he was already doctor and professor of theology.\r\nDuring this period he was distinguished for his opposition to the\r\nscholastic philosophy; and, though he did not go to all lengths with the\r\n\"modernists\" (_Moderni_) of his day, his first work--_Logices\r\nexercitamenta_ (1507)--was distinctly on their side. This attitude\r\nbrought him into conflict with the senate of the university, a conflict\r\nwhich Eck's masterful temper, increased by an extreme self-confidence\r\nperhaps natural in one so young and so successful, did not serve to\r\nallay. His position in Freiburg becoming intolerable, he accepted in\r\n1510 an invitation from the duke of Bavaria to fill the theological\r\nchair at Ingolstadt, where he was destined for thirty years to exercise\r\na profound influence as teacher and vice-chancellor (_Prokanzler_).\r\n\r\nA ducal commission, appointed to find a means for ending the\r\ninterminable strife between the rival academic parties, entrusted Eck\r\nwith the preparation of fresh commentaries on Aristotle and Petrus\r\nHispanus. He had a marvellous capacity for work, and between 1516 and\r\n1520, in addition to all his other duties, he published commentaries on\r\nthe _Summulae_ of Petrus Hispanus, and on the _Dialectics_, _Physics_\r\nand lesser scientific works of Aristotle, which became the text-books of\r\nthe university. During these early years Eck was still reckoned among\r\nthe \"modernists,\" and his commentaries are inspired with much of the\r\nscientific spirit of the New Learning. His aim, however, had been to\r\nfind a _via media_ between the old and new; his temper was essentially\r\nconservative, his imagination held captive by the splendid traditions of\r\nthe medieval church, and he had no sympathy with the revolutionary\r\nattitude of the Reformers. Personal ambition, too, a desire to be\r\nconspicuous in the great world of affairs, may have helped to throw him\r\ninto public opposition to Luther. He had won laurels in a public\r\ndisputation at Augsburg in 1514, when he had defended the lawfulness of\r\nputting out capital at interest; again at Bologna in 1515, on the same\r\nsubject and on the question of predestination; and these triumphs had\r\nbeen repeated at Vienna in 1516. By these successes he gained the\r\npatronage of the Fuggers, and found himself fairly launched as the\r\nrecognized apologist of the established order in church and state.\r\nDistinguished humanists might sneer at him as \"a garrulous sophist\"; but\r\nfrom this time his ambition was not only to be the greatest scientific\r\nauthority in Germany but also the champion of the papacy and of the\r\ntraditional church order. The first-fruits of this new resolve were a\r\nquite gratuitous attack on his old friend, the distinguished humanist\r\nand jurist Ulrich Zasius (1461-1536), for a doctrine proclaimed ten\r\nyears before, and a simultaneous assault on Erasmus's _Annotationes in\r\nNovum Testamentum_.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, by his controversy with Luther and the other reformers\r\nthat Eck is best remembered. Luther, who had some personal acquaintance\r\nwith Eck, sent him in 1517 copies of his celebrated 95 theses. Eck made\r\nno public reply; but in 1518 he circulated, privately at first, his\r\n_Obelisci_, in which Luther was branded as a Hussite. Luther entrusted\r\nhis defence to Carlstadt, who, besides answering the insinuations of Eck\r\nin 400 distinct theses, declared his readiness to meet him in a public\r\ndisputation. The challenge was accepted, and the disputation took place\r\nat Leipzig in June and July 1519. On June 27 and 28 and on July 1 and 3\r\nEck disputed with Carlstadt on the subjects of grace, free will and good\r\nworks, ably defending the Roman Semipelagian standpoint. From July 4 to\r\n14 he engaged with Luther on the absolute supremacy of the papacy,\r\npurgatory, penance, &c., showing a brilliant display of patristic and\r\nconciliar learning against the reformer's appeals to Scripture. The\r\narbitrators declined to give a verdict, but the general impression was\r\nthat victory rested with Eck. He did, indeed, succeed in making Luther\r\nadmit that there was some truth in the Hussite opinions and declare\r\nhimself against the pope, but this success only embittered his animosity\r\nagainst his opponents, and from that time his whole efforts were devoted\r\nto Luther's overthrow. He induced the universities of Cologne and\r\nLouvain to condemn the reformer's writings, but failed to enlist the\r\nGerman princes, and in January 1520 went to Rome to obtain strict\r\nregulations against those whom he called \"Lutherans.\" He was created a\r\nprotonotary apostolic, and in July returned to Germany, as papal nuncio,\r\nwith the celebrated bull _Exsurge Domine_ directed against Luther's\r\nwritings. He now believed himself in a position to crush not only the\r\nLutheran heretics, but also his humanist critics. The effect of the\r\npublication of the bull, however, soon undeceived him. Bishops,\r\nuniversities and humanists were at one in denunciation of the outrage;\r\nand as for the attitude of the people, Eck was glad to escape from\r\nSaxony with a whole skin. In his wrath he appealed to force, and his\r\n_Epistola ad Carolum V._ (February 18, 1521) called on the emperor to\r\ntake measures against Luther, a demand soon to be responded to in the\r\nedict of Worms. In 1521 and 1522 Eck was again in Rome, reporting on the\r\nresults of his nunciature. On his return from his second visit he was\r\nthe prime mover in the promulgation of the Bavarian religious edict of\r\n1522, which practically established the senate of the university of\r\nIngolstadt as a tribunal of the Inquisition, and led to years of\r\npersecution. In return for this action of the duke, who had at first\r\nbeen opposed to the policy of repression, Eck obtained for him, during a\r\nthird visit to Rome in 1523, valuable ecclesiastical concessions.\r\nMeanwhile he continued unabated in his zeal against the reformers,\r\npublishing eight considerable works between 1522 and 1526.\r\n\r\nHis controversial ardour was, indeed, somewhat damped by Luther's\r\nrefusal to answer his arguments, and with a view to earning fresh\r\nlaurels he turned his attention to Switzerland and the Zwinglians. At\r\nBaden-in-Aargau in May and June 1526 a public disputation on the\r\ndoctrine of transubstantiation was held, in which Eck and Thomas Murner\r\nwere pitted against Johann Oecolampadius. Though Eck claimed the victory\r\nin argument, the only result was to strengthen the Swiss in their\r\nmemorial view of the Lord's Supper, and so to diverge them further from\r\nLuther. At the Augsburg diet in 1530 Eck was charged by Charles V. to\r\ndraw up, in concert with twenty other theologians, the refutation of the\r\nProtestant Confession, but was obliged to rewrite it five times before\r\nit suited the emperor. He was at the colloquy of Worms in 1540 and at\r\nthe diet of Regensburg (Ratisbon) in 1541. At Worms he showed some signs\r\nof a willingness to compromise, but at Regensburg his old violence\r\nreasserted itself in opposing all efforts at reconciliation and\r\npersuading the Catholic princes to reject the Interim.\r\n\r\nEck died at Ingolstadt on the 10th of February 1543, fighting to the\r\nlast and worn out before his time. He was undoubtedly the most\r\nconspicuous champion produced by the old religion in the age of the\r\nReformation, but his great gifts were marred by greater faults. His vast\r\nlearning was the result of a powerful memory and unwearied industry, and\r\nhe lacked the creative imagination necessary to mould this material into\r\nnew forms. He was a powerful debater, but his victories were those of a\r\ndialectician rather than a convincing reasoner, and in him depth of\r\ninsight and conviction were ill replaced by the controversial violence\r\ncharacteristic of the age. Moreover, even after discounting the bias of\r\nhis enemies, there is evidence to prove that his championship of the\r\nChurch was not the outcome of his zeal for Christianity; for he was\r\nnotoriously drunken, unchaste, avaricious and almost insanely ambitious.\r\nHis chief work was _De primatu Petri_ (1519); his _Enchiridion locorum\r\ncommunium adversus Lutherum_ ran through 46 editions between 1525 and\r\n1576. In 1530-1535 he published a collection of his writings against\r\nLuther, _Opera contra Ludderum_, in 4 vols.\r\n\r\n  See T. Wiedemann, _Dr Johann Eck_ (Regensburg, 1865).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nECKERMANN, JOHANN PETER (1792-1854), German poet and author, best known\r\nowing to his association with Goethe, was born at Winsen in Hanover on\r\nthe 21st of September 1792, of humble parentage, and was brought up in\r\npenury and privation. After serving as a volunteer in the War of\r\nLiberation (1813-1814), he obtained a secretarial appointment under the\r\nwar department at Hanover. In 1817, although twenty-five years of age,\r\nhe was enabled to attend the gymnasium of Hanover and afterwards the\r\nuniversity of Gottingen, which, however, after one year's residence as a\r\nstudent of law, he left in 1822. His acquaintance with Goethe began in\r\nthe following year, when he sent to him the manuscript of his _Beitrage\r\nzur Poesie_ (1823). Soon afterwards he went to Weimar, where he\r\nsupported himself as a private tutor. For several years he also\r\ninstructed the son of the grand duke. In 1830 he travelled in Italy with\r\nGoethe's son. In 1838 he was given the title of grand-ducal councillor\r\nand appointed librarian to the grand-duchess. Eckermann is chiefly\r\nremembered for his important contributions to the knowledge of the\r\ngreat poet contained in his _Conversations with Goethe_ (1836-1848). To\r\nEckermann Goethe entrusted the publication of his _Nachgelassene\r\nSchriften_ (posthumous works) (1832-1833). He was also joint-editor with\r\nFriedrich Wilhelm Riemer (1774-1845) of the complete edition of Goethe's\r\nworks in 40 vols. (1839-1840). He died at Weimar on the 3rd of December\r\n1854.\r\n\r\n  Eckermann's _Gesprache mit Goethe_ (vols. i. and ii. 1836; vol. iii.\r\n  1848; 7th ed., Leipzig, 1899; best edition by L. Geiger, Leipzig,\r\n  1902) have been translated into almost all the European languages, not\r\n  excepting Turkish. (English translations by Margaret Fuller, Boston,\r\n  1839, and John Oxenford, London, 1850.) Besides this work and the\r\n  _Beitrage zur Poesie_, Eckermann published a volume of poems\r\n  (_Gedichte_, 1838), which are of little value. See _J.P. Eckermanns\r\n  Nachlass_, herausgegeben von F. Tewes, vol. i. (1905), and an article\r\n  by R.M. Meyer in the _Goethe-Jahrbuch_, xvii. (1896).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nECKERNFORDE, a town of Germany, in the Prussian province of\r\nSchleswig-Holstein, on a fjord of the Baltic, 20 m. by rail N.W. from\r\nKiel. Pop. (1905) 7088. It has a good harbour, fishing, trade in\r\nagricultural products, and manufactures of tobacco, salt and iron goods.\r\nThere are a technical school of building and a Protestant teachers'\r\nseminary. Eckernforde is mentioned as far back as 1197. It was taken by\r\nChristian IV. of Denmark in 1628 from the Imperial troops. In 1813 the\r\nDanes were defeated here, while in 1849 the harbour was the scene of the\r\nblowing up of the Danish line-of-battle ship \"Christian VIII.\" and of\r\nthe surrender of the frigate \"Gefion\" after an engagement with the\r\nGerman shore batteries. The place lost most of its trade after the union\r\nwith Germany in 1864, and suffered severely from a sea-flood in 1872. In\r\nthe immediate neighbourhood is the village of Borby, much frequented for\r\nsea-bathing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nECKERSBERG, KRISTOFFER (1783-1853), Danish painter, was born in south\r\nJutland. He became successively the pupil of Nikolaj Abildgaard and of\r\nJ.L. David. From 1810 to 1813 he lived at Paris under the direction of\r\nthe latter, and then proceeded, as an independent artist, to Rome, where\r\nhe worked until 1816 in close fellowship with Thorwaldsen. His paintings\r\nfrom this period--\"The Spartan Boy,\" \"Bacchus and Ariadne\" and\r\n\"Ulysses\"--testify to the influence of the great sculptor over the art\r\nof Eckersberg. Returning to Copenhagen, he found himself easily able to\r\ntake the first place among the Danish painters of his time, and his\r\nportraits especially were in extreme popularity. It is claimed for\r\nEckersberg by the native critics that \"he created a Danish colour,\" that\r\nis to say, he was the first painter who threw off conventional tones and\r\nthe pseudo-classical landscape, in exchange for the clear atmosphere and\r\nnatural outlines of Danish scenery. But Denmark has no heroic landscape,\r\nand Eckersberg in losing the golden commonplaces scarcely succeeds in\r\nbeing delightful. His landscapes, however, are pure and true, while in\r\nhis figure-pieces he is almost invariably conventional and\r\nold-fashioned. He was president of the Danish Academy of Fine Arts in\r\nCharlottenburg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nECKHART,[1] JOHANNES [\"Meister Eckhart\"] (?1260-?1327), German\r\nphilosopher, the first of the great speculative mystics. Extremely\r\nlittle is known of his life; the date and place of his birth are equally\r\nuncertain. According to some accounts, he was a native of Strassburg,\r\nwith which he was afterwards closely connected; according to others, he\r\nwas born in Saxony, or at Hochheim near Gotha. Trithemius, one of the\r\nbest authorities, speaks of him merely as \"Teutonicus.\" 1260 has\r\nfrequently been given as the date of his birth; it was in all\r\nprobability some years earlier, for we know that he was advanced in age\r\nat the time of his death, about 1327. He appears to have entered the\r\nDominican order, and to have acted for some time as professor at one of\r\nthe colleges in Paris. His reputation for learning was very high, and in\r\n1302 he was summoned to Rome by Boniface VIII., to assist in the\r\ncontroversy then being carried on with Philip of France. From Boniface\r\nhe received the degree of doctor. In 1304 he became provincial of his\r\norder for Saxony, and in 1307 was vicar-general for Bohemia. In both\r\nprovinces he was distinguished for his practical reforms and for his\r\npower in preaching. Towards 1325 we hear of him as preaching with great\r\neffect at Cologne, where he gathered round him a numerous band of\r\nfollowers. Before this time, and in all probability at Strassburg, where\r\nhe appears to have been for some years, he had come in contact with the\r\nBeghards (see BEGUINES) and Brethren of the Free Spirit, whose\r\nfundamental notions he may, indeed, be said to have systematized and\r\nexpounded in the highest form to which they could attain. In 1327 the\r\nopponents of the Beghards laid hold of certain propositions contained in\r\nEckhart's works, and he was summoned before the Inquisition at Cologne.\r\nThe history of this accusation is by no means clear. Eckhart appears,\r\nhowever, to have made a conditional recantation--that is, he professed\r\nto disavow whatever in his writings could be shown to be erroneous.\r\nFurther appeal, perhaps at his own request, was made to Pope John XXII.,\r\nand in 1329 a bill was published condemning certain propositions\r\nextracted from Eckhart's works. But before its publication Eckhart was\r\ndead. The exact date of his death is unknown. Of his writings, several\r\nof which are enumerated by Trithemius, there remain only the sermons and\r\na few tractates. Till the middle of the 19th century the majority of\r\nthese were attributed to Johann Tauler, and it is only from Pfeiffer's\r\ncareful edition (_Deutsche Mystiker d. XIV. Jahrhunderts_, vol. ii.,\r\n1857) that one has been able to gather a true idea of Eckhart's\r\nactivity. From his works it is evident that he was deeply learned in all\r\nthe philosophy of the time. He was a thorough Aristotelian, but by\r\npreference appears to have been drawn towards the mystical writings of\r\nthe Neoplatonists and the pseudo-Dionysius. His style is unsystematic,\r\nbrief and abounding in symbolical expression. His manner of thinking is\r\nclear, calm and logical, and he has certainly given the most complete\r\nexposition of what may be called Christian pantheism.\r\n\r\nEckhart has been called the first of the speculative mystics. In his\r\ntheories the element of mystical speculation for the first time comes to\r\nthe front as all-important. By its means the church doctrines are made\r\nintelligible to the many, and from it the church dogmas receive their\r\ntrue significance. It was but natural that he should diverge more and\r\nmore widely from the traditional doctrine, so that at length the\r\nrelation between his teaching and that of the church appeared to be one\r\nof opposition rather than of reconciliation. Eckhart is in truth the\r\nfirst who attempted with perfect freedom and logical consistency to give\r\na speculative basis to religious doctrines. The two most important\r\npoints in his, as in all mystical theories, are first, his doctrine of\r\nthe divine nature, and second, his explanation of the relation between\r\nGod and human thought.

His father was farm-steward to Count\r\nZinzendorf, and he received his early education at the Jesuits' College,\r\nVienna, where at the age of fourteen he was admitted into the order. He\r\ndevoted himself to antiquities and numismatics. After being engaged as\r\nprofessor of poetry and rhetoric, first at Steyer and afterwards at\r\nVienna, he was appointed in 1772 keeper of the cabinet of coins at the\r\nJesuits' College, and in the same year he went to Italy for the purpose\r\nof personal inspection and study of antiquities and coins. At Florence\r\nhe was employed to arrange the collection of the grand duke of Tuscany;\r\nand the first-fruits of his study of this and other collections appeared\r\nin his _Numi veteres anecdoti_, published in 1775. On the dissolution of\r\nthe order of Jesuits in 1773, Eckhel was appointed by the empress Maria\r\nTheresa professor of antiquities and numismatics at the university of\r\nVienna, and this post he held for twenty-four years. He was in the\r\nfollowing year made keeper of the imperial cabinet of coins, and in 1779\r\nappeared his _Catalogus Vindobonensis numorum veterum_. Eckhel's great\r\nwork is the _Doctrina numorum veterum_, in 8 vols., the first of which\r\nwas published in 1792, and the last in 1798. The author's rich learning,\r\ncomprehensive grasp of his subject, admirable order and precision of\r\nstatement in this masterpiece drew from Heyne enthusiastic praise, and\r\nthe acknowledgment that Eckhel, as the Coryphaeus of numismatists, had,\r\nout of the mass of previously loose and confused facts, constituted a\r\ntrue science. A volume of _Addenda_, prepared by Steinbuchel from\r\nEckhel's papers after his death, was published in 1826. Among his other\r\nworks are--_Choix de pierres gravees du Cabinet Imperial des Antiques_\r\n(1788), a useful school-book on coins entitled _Kurzgefasste\r\nAnfangsgrunde zur alten Numismatik_ (1787), of which a French version\r\nenlarged by Jacob appeared in 1825, &c. Eckhel died at Vienna on the\r\n16th of May 1798.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nECKMUHL, or EGGMUHL, a village of Germany, in the kingdom of Bavaria, on\r\nthe Grosse Laaber, 13 m. S.E. of Regensburg by the railway to Munich. It\r\nis famous as the scene of a battle fought here on the 22nd of April\r\n1809, between the French, Bavarians and Wurttembergers under Napoleon,\r\nand the Austrians under the Archduke Charles, which resulted in the\r\ndefeat of the latter. Napoleon, in recognition of Marshal Davout's great\r\nshare in the victory, conferred on him the title of prince of Eckmuhl.\r\nFor an account of this action and those of Abensberg and Landshut see\r\nNAPOLEONIC CAMPAIGNS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nECLECTICISM (from Gr. [Greek: eklego], I select), a term used specially\r\nin philosophy and theology for a composite system of thought made up of\r\nviews borrowed from various other systems. Where the characteristic\r\ndoctrines of a philosophy are not thus merely adopted, but are the\r\nmodified products of a blending of the systems from which it takes its\r\nrise, the philosophy is not properly eclectic. Eclecticism always tends\r\nto spring up after a period of vigorous constructive speculation,\r\nespecially in the later stages of a controversy between thinkers of\r\npre-eminent ability. Their respective followers, and more especially\r\ncultured laymen, lacking the capacity for original work, seeking for a\r\nsolution in some kind of compromise, and possibly failing to grasp the\r\nessentials of the controversy, take refuge in a combination of those\r\nelements in the opposing systems which seem to afford a sound practical\r\ntheory. Since these combinations have often been as illogical as facile,\r\n\"eclecticism\" has generally acquired a somewhat contemptuous\r\nsignificance. At the same time, the essence of eclecticism is the\r\nrefusal to follow blindly one set of formulae and conventions, coupled\r\nwith a determination to recognize and select from all sources those\r\nelements which are good or true in the abstract, or in practical affairs\r\nmost useful _ad hoc_. Theoretically, therefore, eclecticism is a\r\nperfectly sound method, and the contemptuous significance which the word\r\nhas acquired is due partly to the fact that many eclectics have been\r\nintellectual trimmers, sceptics or dilettanti, and partly to mere\r\npartisanship. On the other hand, eclecticism in the sphere of abstract\r\nthought is open to this main objection that, in so far as every\r\nphilosophic system is, at least in theory, an integral whole, the\r\ncombination of principles from hostile theories must result in an\r\nincoherent patchwork. Thus it might be argued that there can be no\r\nlogical combination of elements from Christian ethics, with its divine\r\nsanction, and purely intuitional or evolutionary ethical theories, where\r\nthe sanction is essentially different in quality. It is in practical\r\naffairs that the eclectic or undogmatic spirit is most valuable, and\r\nalso least dangerous.\r\n\r\nIn the 2nd century B.C. a remarkable tendency toward eclecticism began\r\nto manifest itself. The longing to arrive at the one explanation of all\r\nthings, which had inspired the older philosophers, became less earnest;\r\nthe belief, indeed, that any such explanation was attainable began to\r\nfail. Thus men came to adopt from all systems the doctrines which best\r\npleased them. In Panaetius we find one of the earliest examples of the\r\nmodification of Stoicism by the eclectic spirit; about the same time the\r\nsame spirit displayed itself among the Peripatetics. In Rome philosophy\r\nnever became more than a secondary pursuit; naturally, therefore, the\r\nRoman thinkers were for the most part eclectic. Of this tendency Cicero\r\nis the most striking illustration--his philosophical works consisting of\r\nan aggregation, with little or no blending, of doctrines borrowed from\r\nStoicism, Peripateticism, and the scepticism of the Middle Academy.\r\n\r\nIn the last stage of Greek philosophy the eclectic spirit produced\r\nremarkable results outside the philosophies of those properly called\r\neclectics. Thinkers chose their doctrines from many sources--from the\r\nvenerated teaching of Aristotle and Plato, from that of the Pythagoreans\r\nand of the Stoics, from the old Greek mythology, and from the Jewish and\r\nother Oriental systems. Yet it must be observed that Neoplatonism,\r\nGnosticism, and the other systems which are grouped under the name\r\nAlexandrian, were not truly eclectic, consisting, as they did, not of a\r\nmere syncretism of Greek and Oriental thought, but of a mutual\r\nmodification of the two. It is true that several of the Neoplatonists\r\nprofessed to accept all the teaching both of Plato and of Aristotle,\r\nwhereas, in fact, they arbitrarily interpreted Aristotle so as to make\r\nhim agree with Plato, and Plato so as to make his teachings consistent\r\nwith the Oriental doctrines which they had adopted, in the same manner\r\nas the schoolmen attempted to reconcile Aristotle with the doctrines of\r\nthe church. Among the early Christians, Clement of Alexandria, Origen\r\nand Synesius were eclectics in philosophy.\r\n\r\nThe eclectics of modern philosophy are too numerous to name. Of Italian\r\nphilosophers the eclectics form a large proportion. Among the German we\r\nmay mention Wolf and his followers, as well as Mendelssohn, J.A.\r\nEberhard, Ernst Platner, and to some extent Schelling, whom, however, it\r\nwould be incorrect to describe as merely an eclectic. In the first\r\nplace, his speculations were largely original; and in the second place,\r\nit is not so much that his views of any time were borrowed from a number\r\nof philosophers, as that his thinking was influenced first by one\r\nphilosopher, then by another.\r\n\r\nIn the 19th century the term \"eclectic\" came to be applied specially to\r\na number of French philosophers who differed considerably from one\r\nanother. Of these the earliest were Pierre Paul Royer-Collard, who was\r\nmainly a follower of Thomas Reid, and Maine de Biran; but the name is\r\nstill more appropriately given to the school of which the most\r\ndistinguished members are Victor Cousin, Theodore Jouffroy, J.P.\r\nDamiron, Barthelemy St Hilaire, C.F.M. de Remusat, Adolphe Garnier and\r\nRavaisson-Mollien. Cousin, whose views varied considerably at different\r\nperiods of his life, not only adopted freely what pleased him in the\r\ndoctrines of Pierre Laromiguiere, Royer-Collard and Maine de Biran, of\r\nKant, Schelling and Hegel, and of the ancient philosophies, but\r\nexpressly maintained that the eclectic is the only method now open to\r\nthe philosopher, whose function thus resolves itself into critical\r\nselection and nothing more. \"Each system,\" he asserted, \"is not false,\r\nbut incomplete, and in reuniting all incomplete systems, we should have\r\na complete philosophy, adequate to the totality of consciousness.\" This\r\nassumes that every philosophical truth is already contained somewhere in\r\nthe existing systems. If, however, as it would surely be rash to deny,\r\nthere still remains philosophical truth undiscovered, but discoverable\r\nby human intelligence, it is evident that eclecticism is not the only\r\nphilosophy. Eclecticism gained great popularity, and, partly owing to\r\nCousin's position as minister of public instruction, became the\r\nauthorized system in the chief seats of learning in France, where it has\r\ngiven a most remarkable impulse to the study of the history of\r\nphilosophy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nECLIPSE (Gr. [Greek: ekleipsis], falling out of place, failing), the\r\ncomplete or partial obscuration of one heavenly body by the shadow of\r\nanother, or of the disk of the sun by the interposition of the moon;\r\nthen called an eclipse of the sun. Eclipses are of three classes: those\r\nof the sun, as just defined; those of the moon, produced by its passage\r\nthrough the shadow of the earth, and those of the satellites of other\r\nplanets, produced by their passage through the shadow of their primary.\r\nJupiter (q.v.) is the only planet of whose satellites the eclipses can\r\nbe observed, unless under very rare circumstances.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nThe geometrical conditions of an eclipse of the sun or moon are shown in\r\nfig. 1, which represents the earth E as casting its shadow towards C,\r\nand the moon M between the earth and sun as throwing its shadow towards\r\nsome part of the earth and eclipsing the sun. The dark conical regions\r\nare those within which the sun is entirely hidden from sight. This\r\nportion of the shadow is called the _umbra_. Around the umbra is an\r\nenveloping shaded cone with its vertices directly towards the sun. To an\r\nobserver within this region the sun is partly hidden from view. As the\r\napparent path of the moon may pass to the north or south of the line\r\njoining the earth and sun, the axis of its shadow may pass to the north\r\nor south of the earth, and not meet it at all. An eclipse of the sun is\r\ncalled _central_ when the shadow axis strikes any part of the earth;\r\npartial when only the penumbra falls upon the earth. It is evident that\r\nan eclipse can be seen as central only at those points of the earth's\r\nsurface over which the axis of the shadow passes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\nA central eclipse is _total_ when the umbra actually reaches the earth;\r\n_annular_ when it does not. These two cases are shown in figs. 2 and 3.\r\nIn the first of these the sun is entirely hidden within the region uu'.\r\nIn fig. 3 within the region aa' the apparent diameter of the sun is\r\nslightly greater than that of the moon, and at the moment of greatest\r\neclipse a narrow ring of sunlight is seen surrounding the dark body of\r\nthe moon.\r\n\r\nWe shall treat the subject in the following sections:--\r\n\r\nI. Phenomena of Eclipses of the Sun and conclusions derived from their\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\nII. Eclipses of the Moon.\r\n\r\nIII. The Laws and Cycles of recurrences of Eclipses of the Sun and Moon.\r\n\r\nIV. Chronological list of remarkable eclipses of the Sun, past and\r\nfuture, to the end of the 20th century.\r\n\r\nV. Description of the methods of computing eclipses.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. _Phenomena of Eclipses of the Sun._\r\n\r\nWhile an eclipse of the sun, whether partial, annular or total, is in\r\nprogress, no striking phenomena are to be noted until, in the case of\r\ntotal eclipses, the moment of the total phase approaches. It will,\r\nhowever, be noticed that as the moon advances on the solar disk the\r\nsharply defined and ragged edge of the moon's disk contrasts strongly\r\nwith the soft and uniform outline of the sun's limb. As the total phase\r\napproaches, the phenomenon known as _shadow bands_ may sometimes be\r\nseen. These consist of seeming vague and rapidly moving wave-like\r\nalternations of light and shade flitting over any white surface\r\nilluminated by the sun's rays immediately before and after the total\r\nphase. They are probably due to a flickering of the light from the thin\r\ncrescent, produced by the undulations of the air, in the same way that\r\nthe twinkling of the stars is produced. The rapid progressive motion\r\nsometimes assigned to them may be regarded as the natural result of an\r\noptical illusion. A few seconds before the commencement of the total\r\nphase the red light of the chromosphere becomes visible, and will be\r\nseen most distinctly as continuations of the solar crescent at its two\r\nends. Owing to the inequalities of the lunar surface, the diminution of\r\nthe solar crescent does not go on with perfect uniformity, but, just\r\nbefore the last moment, what remains of it is generally broken up into\r\nseparate portions of light, which, magnified and diffused by the\r\nirradiation of the telescope, present the phenomenon long celebrated\r\nunder the name of \"Baily's beads.\" These were so called because minutely\r\nand vividly described by Francis Baily as he observed them during the\r\nannular eclipse of May 15, 1836, when he compared them to a string of\r\nbright beads, irregular in size and distance from each other. The\r\ndisappearance of the last bead is commonly taken as the beginning of\r\ntotality. An arc of the chromosphere will then be visible for a few\r\nseconds at and on each side of the point of disappearance, the length\r\nand duration of which will depend on the apparent diameter of the moon\r\nas compared with that of the sun, being greater in length and longer\r\nseen as the excess of diameter of the moon is less. The red prominences\r\nmay now generally be seen here and there around the whole disk of the\r\nmoon, while the effulgence of soft light called the corona surrounds it\r\non all sides. Before the invention of the spectroscope, observers of\r\ntotal eclipses could do little more than describe in detail the varying\r\nphenomena presented by the prominences and the corona. Drawings of the\r\nlatter showed it to have the appearance of rays surrounding the dark\r\ndisk of the moon, quite similar to the glory depicted by the old\r\npainters around the head of a saint. The discrepancies between the\r\noutlines as thus pictured, not only at different times, but by different\r\nobservers at the same time and place, are such as to show that little\r\nreliance can be placed on the details represented by hand drawings.\r\n\r\nDuring the eclipse of July 8, 1842, the shadow of the moon passed from\r\nPerpignan, France, through Milan and Vienna, over Russia and Central\r\nAsia, to the Pacific Ocean. Very detailed physical observations were\r\nmade, but none which need be specially mentioned in the present\r\nconnexion.\r\n\r\nThe eclipse of July 28, 1851, was total in Scandinavia and Russia. It\r\nwas observed in the former region by many astronomers, among them Sir\r\nGeorge B. Airy and W.R. Dawes. It was specially noteworthy for the first\r\nattempt to photograph such a phenomenon. A daguerreotype clearly showing\r\nthe protuberances was taken by Berkowski at the Observatory of\r\nKonigsberg. An attempt by G.A. Majocchi to daguerreotype the corona was\r\na failure. Photographs of the eclipse of July 18, 1860, were taken by\r\nPadre Angelo Secchi and Warren De La Rue, which showed the prominences\r\nwell, and proved that they were progressively obscured by the edge of\r\nthe advancing moon. It was thus shown that they were solar appendages,\r\nand did not belong to the moon, as had sometimes been supposed. The\r\ncorona was barely visible on De La Rue's plates, but those of Secchi\r\nshowed it, with its rifts and the bases of the tall coronal wings, to\r\nabout 15' from the sun's limb. The sketches taken at this eclipse proved\r\nthat the corona extended in some regions 1 deg. from the sun's limb. As\r\nthe sensitiveness of photographic plates has increased, they have\r\ngradually been wholly relied upon for information respecting the corona,\r\nso that at the present time naked-eye descriptions are regarded as of\r\nlittle or no scientific value. Owing to the great contrast between the\r\nbrilliancy of the coronal light at its base and its increasing faintness\r\nas it extends farther from the sun, no one photograph will bring out all\r\nthe corona. An exposure of one or two seconds is ample to show the\r\ndetails of inner corona to the best advantage, while longer exposures\r\ngive greater extent of the brighter portions. The most extended\r\nstreamers are very little brighter than the sky, and must be\r\nphotographed with long exposures.\r\n\r\nThe first application of the spectroscope to the phenomenon was made\r\nduring the total solar eclipse of August 18, 1868, by P.J.C. Janssen and\r\nother observers in India. By them was made the capital discovery that\r\nthe red solar prominences give a spectrum of bright lines, and are\r\ntherefore immense masses of incandescent gases, chiefly hydrogen and the\r\nvapours of calcium and helium. Janssen also found that this bright-line\r\nspectrum could be followed after the eclipse was over, and, in fact,\r\ncould be observed at any time when the air was sufficiently transparent.\r\nBy one of those remarkable coincidences which frequently occur in the\r\nhistory of science, this last discovery was made independently by Sir\r\nNorman Lockyer in England before the news of Janssen's success had\r\nreached him. It was afterwards found that, by giving great dispersing\r\npower to the spectroscope, the prominences could be observed in a wide\r\nslit, in their true form. At this eclipse the spectrum of the corona was\r\nalso observed, and was supposed to be continuous, while polariscopic\r\nobservation by Lieutenant Campbell showed it polarized in planes passing\r\nthrough the sun's centre. The conclusion from these two observations was\r\nthat the light was composed, at least in great part, of reflected\r\nsunlight.\r\n\r\nAt the total eclipse of August 7, 1869, it was independently found by\r\nProfessors C.A. Young of Princeton and W. Harkness of Washington that\r\nthe continuous spectrum of the corona was crossed by a bright line in\r\nthe green, which was long supposed to be coincident with 1474 of\r\nKirchhoff's scale. This coincidence is, however, now found not to be\r\nreal, and the line cannot be identified with that of any terrestrial\r\nsubstance. The name \"coronium\" has therefore been given to the supposed\r\ngas which forms it. It is now known that 1474 is a double line, one\r\ncomponent of which is produced by iron, while the other is of unknown\r\norigin. The wave-length of the principal component is 5317, while that\r\nof the coronal line was found at the eclipses of 1896 and 1898 to be\r\n5303.\r\n\r\nThe eclipse of December 28, 1870, passed over the south-western corner\r\nof Spain, Gibraltar, Oran and Sicily. It is memorable for the discovery\r\nby Young of the \"reversing layer\" of the solar atmosphere. This term is\r\nnow applied to a shallow stratum resting immediately upon the\r\nphotosphere, the absorption of which produces the principal dark lines\r\nof the solar spectrum, but which, being incandescent, gives a spectrum\r\nof bright lines by its own light when the light of the sun is cut off.\r\nThis layer is much thinner than the chromosphere, and may be considered\r\nto form the base of the latter. Owing to its thinness, the phenomenon of\r\nthe reversed bright lines is almost instantaneous in its nature, and can\r\nbe observed for a period exceeding one or two seconds only near the edge\r\nof the shadow-path, where the moon advances but little beyond the solar\r\nlimb. Near the central line it is little more than a flash, thus giving\r\nrise to the term \"flash-spectrum.\" Young also at this eclipse saw bright\r\nhydrogen lines when his spectroscope was directed to the centre of the\r\ndark disk of the moon. This can only be attributed to the reflection of\r\nthe light of the prominences and chromosphere from the atmosphere\r\nbetween us and the moon. The coronal light as observed in the\r\nspectroscope may thus be regarded as a mixture of true coronal light\r\nwith chromospheric light reflected from the air, and it is therefore\r\nprobable that the H and K (calcium) lines of the coronal spectrum are\r\nnot true coronal lines, but chromospheric.\r\n\r\nAt the eclipse of December 12, 1871, visible in India and Australia,\r\nJanssen observed, as he supposed, some of the dark lines of the solar\r\nspectrum in the continuous spectrum of the corona, especially D, b and\r\nG. This would show that an important part of the coronal light is due to\r\nreflected sunshine. This feature of the spectrum, however, is doubtful\r\nin the most recent photographs under the best conditions. At this\r\neclipse the remarkable observation was also made by Colonel John\r\nHerschel and Colonel J.F. Tennant that the characteristic line of the\r\ncoronal spectrum is as bright in the dark rifts of the corona as\r\nelsewhere. This would show that the gas coronium does not form the\r\nstreamers of the corona, but is spherical in form and distributed\r\nuniformly about the sun. Photographs were also taken on wet plates by a\r\nparty in Java and by the parties of Lord Lindsay (at Baikul, India) and\r\nof Colonel Tennant (at Dodabetta). The Baikul and Dodabetta photographs\r\nwere of small size (moon's diameter = 3/10 in.), but of excellent\r\ndefinition. A searching study was made of them by A. C Ranyard and W.H.\r\nWesley (_Memoirs R.A.S._ vol. xli., 1879), and for the first time a\r\nsatisfactory representation of the corona was obtained. The drawings in\r\nthe volume quoted show its polar rays, wings, interlacing filaments and\r\nrifts as they are now known to be, as well as the forms and details of\r\nthe prominences.\r\n\r\nThe eclipse of April 16, 1874, was observed in South Africa by E.J.\r\nStone, H.M. astronomer at the Cape, who traced the coronal line about\r\n30' (430,000 m.) from the sun's limb. The visual corona was seen to\r\nextend in places some 90' from the limb.\r\n\r\nThe eclipse of April 6, 1875, was observed in Siam by Sir J. Norman\r\nLockyer and Professor Arthur Schuster. Their photographs showed the\r\ncalcium and hydrogen lines in the prominence spectrum.\r\n\r\nThe eclipse of July 29, 1878, was observed by many astronomers in the\r\nUnited States along a line extending from Wyoming to Texas. A number of\r\nthe stations were at high altitudes (up to 14,000 ft.), and the sky was\r\ngenerally very clear. The visible corona extended on both sides of the\r\nsun along the ecliptic for immense distances--at least twelve lunar\r\ndiameters, about eleven million miles. Photographs taken by the parties\r\nof Professors A. Hall and W. Harkness gave the details of the inner\r\ncorona and of the polar rays, showing the filamentous character of the\r\ncorona, especially at its base in the polar regions. A photograph taken\r\nby the party of Professor E.S. Holden showed the outer corona to a\r\ndistance of 50' from the moon's limb. The bright-line spectrum of the\r\ncorona was excessively faint and, as the solar activity (measured by\r\nsun-spot frequency) was near a minimum, it was concluded that the\r\nbrilliancy of the coronium line varied in the sun-spot period, a\r\nconclusion which subsequent eclipse observations seem to have verified.\r\nIt is not yet certain that the other coronal spectrum lines vary in the\r\nsame way.\r\n\r\nThe eclipse of May 17, 1882, was observed in Egypt. On the photographs\r\nof the corona the image of a bright comet was found, the first instance\r\nof the sort. (A faint comet was found on the plates of the Lick\r\nObservatory eclipse expedition to Chile in 1893.) The slitless\r\nspectroscope showed the green line (coronium) and D3 (helium) in the\r\ncoronal spectrum.\r\n\r\nThe eclipse of May 6, 1883, was observed from a small coral atoll in the\r\nSouth Pacific Ocean by parties from America, England, France, Austria\r\nand Italy. A thorough search was made by Holden (with a 6 in. telescope)\r\nfor an intra-Mercurial planet, without success, during an unusually long\r\ntotality (5 m. 23 s.). J. Palisa also searched for such a planet.\r\nJanssen again reported the presence of dark lines in the coronal\r\nspectrum. \"White\" prominences were seen by P. Tacchini.\r\n\r\nThe eclipse of August 29, 1886, was observed in the West Indies. The\r\nEnglish photographs of the corona, taken with a slitless spectroscope,\r\nshow the hydrogen lines as well as K and f. Tacchini devoted his\r\nattention to the spectra of the prominences, and showed that their upper\r\nportions contained no hydrogen lines, but only the H and K lines of\r\ncalcium. He also observed a very extensive \"white\" prominence. It was\r\nshown on the photographs of the corona, but could not be seen in the\r\nH[alpha] line with the spectroscope. It has been suggested by Professor\r\nG.E. Hale that the colour of a \"white\" prominence may be due to the fact\r\nthat the H and K lines (calcium) are of their normal intensity, while\r\nthe less refrangible prominence lines are, from some unknown cause,\r\ncomparatively faint. It is known that the intensity of such lines does,\r\nin fact, vary, though it is not yet certain that the \"white\" prominences\r\nare produced in this way. The subject is one demanding further\r\nobservation. High prominences are generally \"white\" at their summits,\r\n\"red\" at their bases. The Harvard College Observatory photographs show\r\nthe corona out to 90' from the moon's limb, though no detail is visible\r\nbeyond 60'. W.H. Pickering made a series of photographic photometric\r\nmeasures of the corona, some of which are given below, together with\r\nresults deduced by Holden from the eclipses of January and December\r\n1889:--\r\n\r\n  +--------------------------------------+---------+---------+---------+\r\n  |                                      | August  | January | December|\r\n  |                                      |  1886.  |  1889.  |  1889.  |\r\n  +--------------------------------------+---------+---------+---------+\r\n  | Intrinsic actinic brilliancy of the  |         |         |         |\r\n  |   brightest parts of the corona      | 0.031   | 0.079   | 0.029   |\r\n  |    Do. of the polar rays             |   . .   | 0.053   | 0.016   |\r\n  |    Do. of the sky near the sun       | 0.0007  | 0.0050  | 0.0009  |\r\n  | Ratio of intrinsic brilliancy of the |         |         |         |\r\n  |   brightest parts of the corona to   |         |         |         |\r\n  |   that of the sky (actinic)          | 44 to 1 | 16 to 1 | 32 to 1 |\r\n  | Magnitude of the faintest star       |         |         |         |\r\n  |   shown on the eclipse negatives     |   . .   | 2.3     |   . .   |\r\n  +--------------------------------------+---------+---------+---------+\r\n\r\n  The results in the first and third columns are derived from plates\r\n  taken in a very humid climate, and are not very different.\r\n\r\nThe eclipse of August 19, 1887, was total in Japan and Russia, but\r\ncloudy weather prevented successful observations except in Siberia and\r\neastern Russia.\r\n\r\nThe eclipse of January 1, 1889, was observed in California and Nevada by\r\nmany American astronomers. The photographs of the corona, especially\r\nthose by Charoppin and E.E. Barnard, show a wealth of detail. Those of\r\nBarnard, of the Lick Observatory party, were studied by Holden, and\r\nexhibited the fact that rays, like the \"polar-rays,\" extended all round\r\nthe sun, instead of being confined to the polar regions only. The outer\r\ncorona was registered out to 100' from the moon's limb on Charoppin's\r\nnegatives, to 130' on those of Lowden and Ireland. On other plates the\r\noutline of the moon is visible projected on the corona before totality\r\nbegan. The spectrum of the corona showed few bright lines besides those\r\nof coronium and hydrogen.\r\n\r\nThe eclipse of December 22, 1889, was observed in Cayenne, S. America,\r\nby a party from the Lick Observatory under rather unfavourable\r\nconditions. Expeditions sent to Africa were baffled by cloudy weather.\r\nFather Stephen Joseph Perry observed at Salute Islands, French Guiana,\r\nand obtained some photographs of value. The effort cost him his life,\r\nfor he died of malarial fever five days after the eclipse.\r\n\r\nThe eclipse of April 16, 1893, was observed by British and French\r\nparties in Africa and Brazil, and by Professor J.M. Schaeberle of the\r\nLick Observatory in Chile. The Chile photographs of the corona were\r\ntaken with a lens of 40 ft. focus, and are extremely fine. They show a\r\nfaint comet near the sun. No great extensions to the corona were shown\r\non any of the negatives, or seen visually, though they were specially\r\nlooked for by British parties. The neighbourhood of the sun was\r\ncarefully examined by G. Bigourdan without finding any planet. The\r\nspectrum of the corona was the usual one. The following lines were\r\nphotographed in slitless spectroscopes, and undoubtedly belong to the\r\ncorona: W. L. 3987; 4086; 4217; 4231; 4240; 4280; 4486; 5303 (the last\r\nnumber is the wave-length of the green coronium line). All of these have\r\nbeen seen in slit spectroscopes also. It is possible that two lines\r\nobserved by Young in 1869, namely, W. L. (Angstrom) 5450 and 5570,\r\nshould be added to the list of undoubted coronal lines. It is not likely\r\nthat helium or hydrogen or calcium vapour forms part of the corona. The\r\nwave-lengths of some 700 lines belonging to the chromosphere and\r\nprominences were determined by the British parties.\r\n\r\nThe eclipse of August 9, 1896, was total in Norway, Novaya Zemlya and\r\nJapan. The day was very unfavourable as to weather, but good photographs\r\nof the corona were obtained by Russian parties in Siberia and Lapland.\r\nShackelton, in Novaya Zemlya, with a prismatic camera obtained a\r\nphotograph of the reversing-layer at the beginning of totality. This\r\nphotograph completely confirms Young's discovery, and shows the\r\nprominent Fraunhofer lines bright, the bright lines of the chromosphere\r\nspectrum being especially conspicuous.\r\n\r\nAt the solar eclipse of January 22, 1898, the shadow of the moon\r\ntraversed India from the western coast to the Himalaya. The duration of\r\ntotality was about 2 m. The eclipse was very fully observed, more than\r\n100 negatives of the corona being secured. The equatorial extension of\r\nthe visible corona was short and faint, and the invisible\r\n(spectroscopic) corona was also very faint. The spectrum of the\r\nreversing-layer was successfully photographed; one set of negatives\r\nshows the polarization of one of the longest streamers of the corona,\r\nand proves the presence of dust particles reflecting solar light. The\r\nbright-line spectrum of hydrogen in the chromosphere was followed to the\r\nthirtieth point of the series, and the wave-lengths were shown to agree\r\nclosely with Balmer's formula (see SPECTROSCOPY). The wave-length of\r\ncoronium was found to be 5303 (not 5317 as previously supposed), and the\r\nbrightness of the corona was measured. E.W. Maunder made the curious\r\nobservation of coronal matter enveloping a prominence in the form of a\r\nhood.\r\n\r\nObservations of the eclipse of May 28, 1900, were favoured in a\r\nremarkable degree by the absence of clouds. The photographs of the\r\ncorona obtained by W.W. Campbell extended four diameters of the sun on\r\nthe west side. The sun's edge was photographed with an objective-prism\r\nspectrograph composed of two 60 deg. prisms in front of a telescope of 2\r\nin. aperture and 60 in. focus. A fine photograph, 6 in. long, of the\r\nbright-and dark-line spectra of the sun's edge at the end of totality\r\nwas thus obtained. It shows 600 bright lines sharply in focus besides\r\nthe dark-line spectrum, to which the bright lines gave way as the sun\r\nreappeared. The coronal material radiating the green light was found to\r\nbe markedly heaped up in the sun-spot regions. No dark lines were found\r\nin the spectrum of the inner corona. G.E. Hale and E.B. Frost also\r\nphotographed the combined bright-and dark-line spectra of the solar\r\ncusps at the instants before and after totality. On one photograph\r\nshowing no dark lines 70 bright lines could be measured between 4070 and\r\n4340. On another were 70 bright lines between Hb and Hs. On a third were\r\n266 bright lines between 4026 and 4381, and some dark lines. These lines\r\nshow a marked dissimilarity from the solar spectrum. (S. N.)\r\n\r\nThe eclipse of May 18, 1901, was observable in Mauritius with 3-1/2\r\nminutes of totality, and in Sumatra with 6-1/2 minutes. Unfortunately\r\nthere was cloudy weather in Sumatra, which at some stations prevented\r\nobservations entirely and at others neutralized the advantages promised\r\nby the long duration of totality. Thus spectroscopic observations for\r\nthe detection of motion of the corona, for which the long totality gave\r\na special opportunity, failed owing to cloud; and the search for\r\nintra-Mercurial planets had only a negative result, though stars down to\r\nmagnitude 8.8 were photographed on the plates. But though no particular\r\nstep in advance was taken, successful records of the eclipse were\r\nobtained, which will enable comparison to be made with other eclipses\r\nand will contribute their share to the discussion of the whole series.\r\nThese include photographs of the corona, showing that it was of the\r\nsun-spot minimum type, and available for measures of its brightness;\r\nphotographs of the spectra of the chromosphere and corona which are of\r\nthe same general character as those obtained at previous eclipses;\r\nphotographs showing the polarization of the corona, available for\r\nquantitative measures of polarization at different points. Photographs\r\nof the spectrum of the outer corona taken by the Lick Observatory party\r\nshow a strong Fraunhofer dark-line spectrum, consistent with the view\r\nthat the light is reflected sunlight. At Mauritius there was no cloud,\r\nbut the definition was poor. Successful photographs of the corona were\r\nobtained for comparison with those taken in Sumatra one and a half hours\r\nlater, but nothing of great interest was revealed by the comparison.\r\n\r\nThe eclipse of August 30, 1905, offered a duration of 3-1/2 minutes in\r\nSpain, the track running from Labrador through Spain to North Africa,\r\nand affording excellent opportunities for observers, who flocked to the\r\ncentral line in great numbers. Unfortunately it was cloudy in Labrador,\r\nso that the special advantages of the long line of possible stations\r\nwere lost. Exceptionally good weather conditions were enjoyed in Algeria\r\nand Tunisia, and full advantage was taken of them by H.F. Newall, C.\r\nTrepied and others at Guelma, by the party from Greenwich and G.\r\nBigourdan at Sfax. That G. Newall's spectroscopic photographs for\r\nrotation of the corona again gave no result is a clear indication of the\r\nfaintness of the corona at 3' from the limb; but F.W. Dyson at Sfax\r\nobtained two new lines at 5536 and 5117 in the spectrum of the corona;\r\nand a very large number of photographs of the corona (including many in\r\npolarized light on several different plans), of its spectrum, and of the\r\nspectrum of the chromosphere, were obtained by the various parties,\r\nwhich will afford copious material for discussion. Newall also obtained\r\na polarized spectrum of the corona. Altogether no less than eighty\r\nstations were occupied. There were English, American, Russian and German\r\nobservers in Egypt; English and French in Algeria and Tunisia; English\r\nin Majorca; observers of almost all nationalities in Spain; and English\r\nand American in Labrador. In Egypt the weather was bright, though the\r\nsun was low; in Majorca and Spain there were local clouds. Consequently\r\nmany observations, in addition to those in Labrador, were lost, notably\r\nthe special spectroscopic observations undertaken by Evershed on the\r\nnorthern limit of totality, and the observations of radiation undertaken\r\nby H.L. Callendar. A search for intra-Mercurial planets was conducted on\r\nan elaborate plan, with similar batteries of telescopes, in Egypt, Spain\r\nand Labrador, by three parties from the Lick Observatory, but the\r\nexamination of the plates showed nothing noteworthy. Pending discussion\r\nof the greater part of the material, some interesting preliminary\r\nresults were published in 1906 by the French observers. C.E.H. Bourget\r\nand Montangerand conclude that there is a marked division of the\r\nchromosphere into two regions or shells, a lower or \"reversing-layer,\"\r\nextending only 1\" from the limb, and a chromospheric layer extending to\r\n3\" or 4\"; and that the coronal light contains less blue and violet, but\r\nmore green and yellow, than sunlight; while Fabry, by visual methods,\r\nobtained measures of the total and intrinsic intensity of the light from\r\nthe corona closely confirming recent photographic observations, finding\r\nthe total brightness about equal to that of the full moon, and the\r\nintrinsic brightness at 5' from the limb about one quarter of that of\r\nthe full moon.     (H. H. T.)\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _Eclipses of the Moon._\r\n\r\nThe physical phenomena attending eclipses of the moon are no longer of a\r\nhigh order of interest either to the layman or scientific observer. A\r\nbrief statement of them and their causes will therefore be sufficient.\r\nAn observer watching such an eclipse from the moon would see the earth,\r\nwhich has nearly four times the apparent diameter of the sun, impinging\r\non the sun's disk and slowly hiding it. The phenomenon would be quite\r\nsimilar to that of an eclipse of the sun seen from the earth, until the\r\nsun was completely covered. During the progress of this partial eclipse\r\nthe moon would be passing into the earth's penumbra. As the moment of\r\ntotal obscuration approached, a red band of light would rapidly form in\r\nthe neighbourhood of the disappearing limb of the sun, and gradually\r\nextend around the earth. This would arise from the refraction of the\r\nsun's light by the earth's atmosphere, and the absorption of its blue\r\nrays. When the light of the sun was completely hidden, a reddish ring of\r\ngreat brilliancy would, owing to this cause, surround the entire dark\r\nbody of the earth during the period of the total eclipse.\r\n\r\nThe aspect of the moon, as seen from the earth, corresponds to this view\r\nfrom the moon. The fading of the moon's light, due to its entrance into\r\nthe penumbra, is scarcely noticeable without direct photometric\r\ndetermination until near the beginning of the total phase. Then, as the\r\nlimb of the moon approaches the earth's shadow, it begins to darken.\r\nWhen only a small portion has entered into the shadow, that portion is\r\ncompletely hidden. But, as the total phase approaches, the part of the\r\nmoon's disk immersed in the penumbra becomes visible by a reddish\r\ncoppery light--that of the sun refracted through the lower parts of the\r\nearth's atmosphere. The brightness of this illumination is different in\r\ndifferent eclipses, a circumstance which may be attributed to the\r\ngreater or less degree of cloudiness in those regions of the earth's\r\natmosphere through which the light of the sun passes in order to reach\r\nthe moon. Its colour is due to absorption in passing through the earth's\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _Laws and Cycles of Recurrences of Eclipses of the Sun and Moon._\r\n\r\nIt has been known since remote antiquity that eclipses occur in cycles.\r\nThese cycles are known now to be determined principally by the motion of\r\nthe moon's node and the relations between the revolutions of the earth\r\nround the sun and the moon round the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Eclipse seasons.\r\n\r\nOwing to the inclination of the moon's orbit to the plane of the\r\necliptic, an eclipse of the sun can occur only when the conjunction of\r\nthe sun and moon takes place within about 16 deg. of one of the nodes of\r\nthe moon's orbit. The eclipse can be total only within about 11 deg. of\r\nthe node. An eclipse of the moon can occur only when the line\r\nsun-moon-earth makes an angle less than about 11 deg. with the line of\r\nnodes; and the eclipse can be total only within about 8 deg. of the\r\nnode, the average limiting distances varying 1 deg. or 2 deg. according\r\nto the circumstances. These conditions being understood, the cycles of\r\nrecurrence of eclipses of either kind can be worked out geometrically\r\nfrom the mean motions of the sun, moon, node and perigee by the aid of\r\ngeometric conceptions shown in their simplest form in fig. 4. Here E is\r\nthe earth, at the centre of a circle representing the mean orbit of the\r\nmoon around it. MN is the line of nodes which is moving in the\r\nretrograde direction from N towards S1, at a rate of about 19.3 deg. in\r\na year, making a complete revolution in 18.6 years. Let the sun at the\r\nmoment of some new moon be in the line ES1, continued. If the angle NES1\r\nis less than 16 deg. there will probably be an eclipse of the sun, which\r\nmay be central if the angle is less than 11 deg. Let the next new moon\r\ntake place in the line ES2 a month later. The mean value of the angle\r\nS1ES2 is about 29 deg.; but as the node N has moved towards S1 about 1.4\r\ndeg. during the interval, the sum of the angles NES1 and NES2 will be\r\nsomewhat greater than S1ES2 by about 1.6 deg. The result is that if\r\nthese two angles are nearly equal there may be two small partial\r\neclipses of the sun, after which no more can occur until, by the annual\r\nrevolution of the earth, the direction of the sun approaches the\r\nopposite line of nodes EM, nearly six months later. The result is that\r\nthere are in the course of any one year two \"eclipse seasons\" each of\r\nabout one month in duration, in which at least one eclipse of the sun,\r\nor possibly two small partial eclipses, may occur. One eclipse of the\r\nmoon will generally, but not always, occur during a season.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\nOwing to the retrograde motion of the node the direction ES of the sun\r\nreturns to the node at the end of about 347 days, so that a third\r\neclipse season may commence before the end of a year. In this way there\r\nis a possible but very rare maximum of five eclipses of the sun in a\r\nyear. Owing to the motion of the line of nodes each eclipse season\r\noccurs about 19 days earlier in the year than it did the year before.\r\nAnother conclusion from the greater eclipse limit for the sun than for\r\nthe moon is that in the long run eclipses of the sun, as regards the\r\nearth generally, occur oftener than those of the moon. But as any\r\neclipse of the sun is visible only from a limited region of the earth's\r\nsurface, while one of the moon may be seen from an entire hemisphere,\r\nmore eclipses of the moon are visible at any one place than of the sun.\r\n\r\nIf, starting with a conjunction along some line ES1, we mark by radial\r\nlines from E the successive conjunctions year after year, we shall find\r\nthat at the end of 18 years and about 11 days the 223rd conjunction will\r\nfall once more very near the line ES1, the angle NES1 being about 24'\r\ngreater than before. Successive eclipses will then occur very nearly in\r\nthe same order as they did 18 years and 11 days before. This period of\r\nrecurrence has been known from remote antiquity and is called the\r\n_Saros_. What is most remarkable in this period is that in addition to\r\nthe distance from the node being nearly the same as before, the\r\nlongitude of the sun increases by only 11 deg. and the distance of the\r\nmoon from its perigee has changed less than 3 deg. The result of this\r\napproach to coincidence is that the recurring eclipse will generally be\r\nof the same kind--total, annular or partial--through a number of\r\nsuccessive periods.\r\n\r\nTo see the law of recurrence of corresponding eclipses in the successive\r\nperiods let us suppose the line of conjunction ES1 to be that at which\r\nthere is a very small eclipse, visible only in high northern or southern\r\nlatitudes. At the end of 18 years 11 days a second eclipse will occur\r\nalong a line nearly half a degree nearer EN, the line of nodes. The\r\nsuccessive eclipses will occur at the same interval through about ten\r\nperiods, or 180 years, when the line of conjunction will pass within 11\r\ndeg. of EN. Then the eclipse will be central, whether annular or total\r\ndepending on circumstances: in the first one the central lines will pass\r\nonly over the polar regions; but in successive eclipses of the series it\r\nwill pass nearer and nearer to the equator until the conjunction line\r\ncoincides with the node. The path of centrality will then cross in the\r\nequatorial region. During 22 or 23 more recurrences the path will\r\ncontinually approach to the opposite pole and finally leave the earth\r\nentirely. The entire number of central eclipses in any one series will\r\ngenerally be about forty-five. Then a series of continually diminishing\r\npartial eclipses will go on for about ten periods more. The whole series\r\nof eclipses will therefore extend through about sixty-five periods; and\r\ninterval of time of about twelve hundred years.\r\n\r\nAnother remarkable eclipse period recurs at the end of 358 lunations. At\r\nthe end of this period the line of mean conjunction ES1 falls so near\r\nits former position relative to the node that we find each central\r\neclipse visible in our time to be one of an unbroken series extending\r\nfrom the earliest historic times to the present, at intervals equal to\r\nthe length of the period. The recurring eclipses in this period do not,\r\nhowever, have the remarkable similarity of those belonging to the Saros,\r\nbut may differ to any extent, owing to the different positions of the\r\nline of conjunction with respect to the moon's perigee. Moreover, they\r\nrecur alternately at the ascending and descending node. The length of\r\nthe period is 10,571.95 days, or 29 Julian years less 20.3 days. Hence\r\n18 periods make 521 years, so that at the end of this time each eclipse\r\nrecurs on or about the same day of the year. As an example of this\r\nseries, starting from the eclipse of Nineveh, June 15, 763 B.C.,\r\nrecorded on the Assyrian tablets, we find eclipses on May 27, 734 B.C.,\r\nMay 7, 705 B.C., and so on in an unbroken series to 1843, 1872 and 1901,\r\nthe last being the 93rd of the series. Those at the ends of the 521-year\r\nintervals occurred on June 15, O.S., of each of the years 763, 242 B.C.,\r\nA.D. 280, 801, 1322 and 1843. As the lunar perigee moves through 242.4\r\ndeg. in a period, the eclipses will vary from total to annular, but at\r\nthe end of 3 periods the perigee is only 7.1 deg. in advance of its\r\noriginal position relative to the node. Hence in a series including\r\nevery third eclipse the eclipses will be of the same character through a\r\nthousand years or more. Thus the eclipses of 1467, 1554, 1640, 1727,\r\n1814, 1901, 1988, &c., are total.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. _Chronological Lists of Eclipses of the Sun._\r\n\r\n\r\n  Notable eclipses.\r\n\r\nThe following is a brief chronological enumeration of those total\r\neclipses of the sun which are of interest, either from their historic\r\ncelebrity or the nature of the conclusions derived from them. In\r\nnumbering the years before the Christian era the astronomical\r\nnomenclature is used, in which the number of the year is one less than\r\nthat used by the chronologists. The Chinese eclipses are passed over,\r\nowing to the generally doubtful character of the records pertaining to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n  --1069 June 20 and --1062 July 31; total eclipses recorded at Babylon.\r\n\r\n  --762, June 14; a total eclipse recorded at Nineveh. Computation from\r\n  the modern tables shows that the path of totality passed about 100 m.\r\n  or more north of Nineveh.\r\n\r\n  --647, April 6; total eclipse at or near Thasos, mentioned by\r\n  Archilochus.\r\n\r\n  --584, May 28; the celebrated eclipse of Thales. For an account of\r\n  this eclipse see THALES.\r\n\r\n  --556, May 19, the eclipse of Larissa. The modern tables show that the\r\n  eclipse was not total at Larissa, and the connexion of the classical\r\n  record with the eclipse is doubtful.\r\n\r\n  --430, August 3; eclipse mentioned by Thucydides, but not total by the\r\n  tables.\r\n\r\n  --399, June 21; eclipse of Ennius. Totality occurred immediately after\r\n  sunset at Rome. The identity of this eclipse is doubtful.\r\n\r\n  --309, August 14; eclipse of Agathocles. This eclipse would be one of\r\n  the most valuable for testing the tables of the moon, but for an\r\n  uncertainty as to the location of Agathocles, who, at the time of the\r\n  occurrence, was at sea on a voyage from Syracuse to Carthage.\r\n\r\n  F.K. Ginzel (_Spezieller Kanon der Finsternisse_) has collected a\r\n  great number of passages from classical authors supposed to refer to\r\n  eclipses of the sun or moon, but the difficulty of identifying the\r\n  phenomenon is frequently such as to justify great doubt as to the\r\n  conclusions. In a few cases no eclipse corresponding to the\r\n  description can be found by our modern table to have occurred, and in\r\n  others the latitude of interpretation and the uncertainty of the date\r\n  are so wide that the eclipse cannot be identified.\r\n\r\n  Of medieval eclipses we mention only the dates of those visible in\r\n  England, referring for details to the works mentioned in the\r\n  bibliography. The letter C following a date shows that the eclipse is\r\n  mentioned in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles. The dates in question are:--\r\n\r\n    A.D. 538, February 15, C. (partial). | A.D.  878, October 29, C.\r\n         540, June 12, C. (partial).     |       885, June 15.\r\n         594, July 23.                   |      1023, January 24.\r\n         603, August 12.                 |      1133, August 1, C.\r\n         639, September 3.               |      1140, March 20, C.\r\n         664, May 1, C.                  |      1185, May 1, C.\r\n         733, August 14 (annular).       |      1191, June 23, C. (annular).\r\n         764, June 4 (annular).          |      1330, July 16.\r\n\r\n  Besides these, the tables show that the shadow of the moon passed over\r\n  some part of the British Islands on 1424, June 26; 1433, June 17;\r\n  1598, March 6; 1652, April 8; 1715, May 2; 1724, May 22. Of these the\r\n  eclipse of 1715 is notable for the careful observations made in\r\n  England, and published by Halley in the _Philosophical Transactions_.\r\n  The next dates are 1927, June 29, when a barely total eclipse will be\r\n  seen soon after sunrise in the northern counties near the Scottish\r\n  border, and 1999, August 11, when the moon's shadow will graze England\r\n  at Land's End.\r\n\r\nWe give below, in tabular form, a list of the principal total eclipses\r\nduring the 19th and 20th centuries, omitting a few visible only in the\r\nextreme polar regions, and some others of which the duration is very\r\nshort. The first column gives the civil date of the point on the earth's\r\nsurface at which the eclipse is central at noon. The next two columns\r\ngive the position of this point to the nearest degree. The fourth column\r\nshows the Greenwich astronomical time of conjunction in longitude. The\r\nnext column gives the duration of the total phase at the noon-point;\r\nthis is sometimes 0.1' less than the absolutely greatest duration at any\r\npoint.

Of interest in this connexion is the recurrence of total eclipses\r\nremarkable for their duration. The absolute maximum duration of a total\r\neclipse is about 7' 30\"; but no actual eclipse can be expected to reach\r\nthis duration. Those which will come nearest to the maximum during the\r\nnext 500 years belong to the series numbered 4 and 6 and in the list\r\nwhich precedes. These occurring in the years 1937, 1955, &c., will\r\nultimately fall little more than 20\" below the maximum. But the series\r\n4, though not now remarkable in this respect, will become so in the\r\nfuture, reaching in the eclipse of June 25, 2150, a duration of about 7'\r\n15\" and on July 5, 2168, a duration of 7' 28\", the longest in human\r\nhistory. The first of these will pass over the Pacific Ocean; the second\r\nover the southern part of the Indian Ocean near Madras.\r\n\r\nAll the national annual Ephemerides contain elements of the eclipses of\r\nthe sun occurring during the year. Those of England, America and France\r\nalso give maps showing the path of the central line, if any, over the\r\nearth's surface; the lines of eclipse beginning and ending at sunrise,\r\n&c., and the outlines of the shadow from hour to hour. By the aid of the\r\nlatter the time at which an eclipse begins or ends at any point can be\r\ndetermined by inspection or measurement within a few minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. _Methods of computing Eclipses of the Sun._\r\n\r\n\r\n  Elements of eclipses.\r\n\r\nThe complete computation of the circumstances of an eclipse ab initio\r\nrequires three distinct processes. The geocentric positions of the sun\r\nand moon have first to be computed from the tables of the motions of\r\nthose bodies. The second step is to compute certain elements of the\r\neclipse from these geocentric positions. The third step is from these\r\nelements to compute the circumstances of the eclipse for the earth\r\ngenerally or for any given place on its surface. The national\r\nAstronomical Ephemerides, or \"Nautical Almanacs,\" give in full the\r\ngeocentric positions of the sun and moon from at least the early part of\r\nthe 19th century to an epoch three years in advance of the date of\r\npublication. It is therefore unnecessary to undertake the first part of\r\nthe computation except for dates outside the limits of the published\r\nephemerides, and for many years to come even this computation will be\r\nunnecessary, because tables giving the elements of eclipses from the\r\nearliest historic periods up to the 22nd century have been published by\r\nT. Ritter von Oppolzer and by Simon Newcomb. We shall therefore confine\r\nourselves to a statement of the eclipse problem and of the principles on\r\nwhich such tables rest.\r\n\r\nTwo systems of eclipse elements are now adopted in the ephemerides and\r\ntables; the one, that of F.W. Bessel, is used in the English, American\r\nand French ephemerides, the other--P. A. Hansen's--in the German and in\r\nthe eclipse tables of T. Ritter von Oppolzer. The two have in common\r\ncertain geometric constructions. The fundamental axis of reference in\r\nboth systems is the line passing through the centres of the sun and\r\nmoon; this is the common axis of the shadow cones, which envelop\r\nsimultaneously the sun and moon as shown in figs. 1, 2, 3. The surface\r\nof one of these cones, that of the umbra, is tangent to both bodies\r\nexternally. This cone comes to a point at a distance from the moon\r\nnearly equal to that of the earth. Within it the sun is wholly hidden by\r\nthe moon. Outside the umbral cone is that of the penumbra, within which\r\nthe sun is partially hidden by the moon. The geometric condition that\r\nthe two bodies shall appear in contact, or that the eclipse shall begin\r\nor end at a certain moment, is that the surface of one of these cones\r\nshall pass through the place of the observer at that moment. Let a\r\nplane, which we call the fundamental plane, pass through the centre of\r\nthe earth perpendicular to the shadow axis. On this plane the centre of\r\nthe earth is taken as an origin of rectangular co-ordinates. The axis of\r\nZ is perpendicular to the plane, and therefore parallel to the shadow\r\naxis; that of Y and X lie in the plane. In these fundamental\r\nconstructions the two methods coincide. They differ in the direction of\r\nthe axis of Y and X in the fundamental plane. In Bessel's method, which\r\nwe shall first describe, the intersection of the plane of the earth's\r\nequator with the fundamental plane is taken as the axis of X. The axis\r\nof Y is perpendicular to it, the positive direction being towards the\r\nnorth. The Besselian elements of an eclipse are then:--x, y, the\r\nco-ordinates of the shadow axis on the fundamental plane; d, the\r\ndeclination of that point in which the shadow axis intersects the\r\ncelestial sphere; [mu], the Greenwich hour angle of this point; l, the\r\nradius of the circle, in which the penumbral or outer cone intersects\r\nthe fundamental plane; and l', the radius of the circle, in which the\r\ninner or umbral cone intersects this plane, taken positively when the\r\nvertex of the cone does not reach the plane, so that the axis must be\r\nproduced, and negatively when the vertex is beyond the plane.\r\n\r\nHansen's method differs from that of Bessel in that the ecliptic is\r\ntaken as the fundamental plane instead of the equator. The axis of X on\r\nthe fundamental plane is parallel to the plane of the ecliptic; that of\r\nY perpendicular to it. The other elements are nearly the same in the two\r\ntheories. As to their relative advantages, it may be remarked that\r\nHansen's co-ordinates follow most simply from the data of the tables,\r\nand are necessarily used in eclipse tables, but that the subsequent\r\ncomputation is simpler by Bessel's method.\r\n\r\nSeveral problems are involved in the complete computation of an eclipse\r\nfrom the elements. First, from the values of the latter at a given\r\nmoment to determine the point, if any, at which the shadow-axis\r\nintersects the surface of the earth, and the respective outlines of the\r\numbra and penumbra on that surface. Within the umbral curve the eclipse\r\nis annular or total; outside of it and within the penumbral curve the\r\neclipse is partial at the given moment. The penumbral line is marked\r\nfrom hour to hour on the maps given annually in the American Ephemeris.\r\nSecond, a series of positions of the central point through the course of\r\nan eclipse gives us the path of the central point along the surface of\r\nthe earth, and the envelopes of the penumbral and umbral curves just\r\ndescribed are boundaries within which a total, annular or partial\r\neclipse will be visible. In particular, we have a certain definite point\r\non the earth's surface on which the edge of the shadow first impinges;\r\nthis impingement necessarily takes place at sunrise. Then passing from\r\nthis point, we have a series of points on the surface at which the\r\nelements of the shadow-cone are in succession tangent to the earth's\r\nsurface. At all these points the eclipse begins at sunrise until a\r\ncertain limit is reached, after which, following the successive\r\nelements, it ends at sunrise. At the limiting point the rim of the moon\r\nmerely grazes that of the sun at sunrise, so that we may say that the\r\neclipse both begins and ends at that time. Of course the points we have\r\ndescribed are also found at the ending of the eclipse. There is a\r\ncertain moment at which the shadow-axis leaves the earth at a certain\r\npoint, and a series of moments when, the elements of the penumbral cone\r\nbeing tangent to the earth's surface, the eclipse is ending at sunset.\r\nThree cases may arise in studying the passage of the outlines of the\r\nshadow over the earth. It may be that all the elements of the penumbral\r\ncone intersect the earth. In this case we shall have both a northern and\r\na southern limit of partial eclipse. In the second case there will be no\r\nlimit on the one side except that of the eclipse beginning or ending at\r\nsunrise or sunset. Or it may happen, as the third case, that the\r\nshadow-axis does not intersect the earth at all; the eclipse will then\r\nnot be central at any point, but at most only partial.\r\n\r\nThe third problem is, from the same data, to find the circumstances of\r\nan eclipse at a given place--especially the times of beginning and\r\nending, or the relative positions of the sun and moon at a given moment.\r\nReference to the formulae for all these problems will be given in the\r\nbibliography of the subject.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--The richest mine of information respecting eclipses of\r\n  the sun and moon is T.R. von Oppolzer's \"Kanon der Finsternisse,\"\r\n  published by the Vienna Academy of Sciences in the 52nd volume of its\r\n  _Denkschriften_ (Vienna, 1887). It contains elements of all eclipses\r\n  both of the sun and moon, from 1207 B.C. to A.D. 2161, a period of\r\n  more than thirty centuries. Appended to the tables is a series of\r\n  charts showing the paths of all central eclipses visible in the\r\n  northern hemisphere during the period covered by the table. The points\r\n  of the path at which the eclipse occurs, at sunrise, noon and sunset,\r\n  are laid down with precision, but the intermediate points are\r\n  frequently in error by several hundred miles, as they were not\r\n  calculated, but projected simply by drawing a circle through the three\r\n  points just mentioned. For this reason we cannot infer from them that\r\n  an eclipse was total at any given place. The correct path can,\r\n  however, be readily computed from the tables given in the work. Eduard\r\n  Mahler's memoir, \"Die centralen Sonnenfinsternisse des 20.\r\n  Jahrhunderts\" (_Denkschriften_, Vienna Academy, vol. xlix.), gives\r\n  more exact paths of the central eclipses of the 20th century, but no\r\n  maps. General tables for computing eclipses are Oppolzer's\r\n  \"Syzygientafeln fur den Mond\" (Publications of the _Astronomische\r\n  Gesellschaft_, xvi.), and Newcomb's, in _Publications of the American\r\n  Ephemeris_, vol. i. part i. Of these, Oppolzer's are constructed with\r\n  greater numerical accuracy and detail, while Newcomb's are founded on\r\n  more recent astronomical data, and are preferable for computing\r\n  ancient eclipses. F.K. Ginzel's _Spezieller Kanon der Sonnen- und\r\n  Mondfinsternisse_ (Berlin, 1899) contains, besides the historical\r\n  researches already mentioned, maps of the paths of central eclipses\r\n  visible in the lands of classical antiquity from 900 B.C. to A.D. 500,\r\n  but computed with imperfect astronomical data. Maguire, \"Monthly\r\n  Notices,\" _R.A.S._ xlv. and xlvi., has mapped the total solar eclipses\r\n  visible in the British Islands from 878 to 1724. General papers of\r\n  interest on the same subject have been published by Rev. S.J. Johnson.\r\n  A resume of all the observations on the physical phenomena of total\r\n  solar eclipses up to 1878, by A.C. Ranyard, is to be found in _Memoirs\r\n  of the Royal Astronomical Society_, vol. xli. A very copious\r\n  development of the computation of eclipses by Bessel's method is found\r\n  in W. Chauvenet's _Spherical and Practical Astronomy_, vol. i. _The\r\n  Theory of Eclipses_, by R. Buchanan (Philadelphia, 1904), treats the\r\n  subject yet more fully. Hansen's method is developed in the\r\n  _Abhandlungen_ of the Leipzig Academy of Sciences, vol. vi.\r\n  (Math.-Phys. Classe, vol. iv.). The formulae of computation by this\r\n  method are found in the introductions to Oppolzer's two works cited\r\n  above.     (S. N.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nECLIPTIC, in astronomy. The plane of the ecliptic is that plane in or\r\nnear which the centre of gravity of the earth and moon revolves round\r\nthe sun. The ecliptic itself is the great circle in which this plane\r\nmeets the celestial sphere. It is also defined, but not with absolute\r\nrigour, as the apparent path described by the sun around the celestial\r\nsphere as the earth performs its annual revolution. Owing to the action\r\nof the moon on the earth, as it performs its monthly revolution in an\r\norbit slightly inclined to the ecliptic, the centre of the earth itself\r\ndeviates from the plane of the ecliptic in a period equal to that of the\r\nnodal revolution of the moon. The deviation is extremely slight, its\r\nmaximum amount ranging between 0.5' and 0.6\". Owing to the action of the\r\nplanets, especially Venus and Jupiter, on the earth, the centre of\r\ngravity of the earth and moon deviates by a yet minuter amount,\r\ngenerally one or two tenths of a second, from the plane of the ecliptic\r\nproper. Owing to the action of the planets, the position of the ecliptic\r\nis subject to a slow secular variation amounting, during our time, to\r\nnearly 47\" per century. The rate of this motion is slowly diminishing.\r\n\r\nThe obliquity of the ecliptic is the angle which its plane makes with\r\nthat of the equator. Its mean value is now about 23 deg. 27'. The motion\r\nof the ecliptic produces a secular variation in the obliquity which is\r\nnow diminishing by an amount nearly equal to the entire motion of the\r\necliptic itself. The laws of motion of the ecliptic and equator are\r\nstated in the article PRECESSION OF THE EQUINOXES.\r\n\r\nAttempts have been made by Laplace and his successors to fix certain\r\nlimits within which the obliquity of the ecliptic shall always be\r\nconfined. The results thus derived are, however, based on imperfect\r\nformulae. When the problem is considered in a rigorous form, it is found\r\nthat no absolute limits can be set. It can, however, be shown that the\r\nobliquity cannot vary more than two or three degrees within a million of\r\nyears of our epoch.\r\n\r\n  The formula for the obliquity of the ecliptic, as derived from the\r\n  laws of motion of it and of the equator, may be developed in a series\r\n  proceeding according to the ascending powers of the time as follows:\r\n  we put T, the time from 1900, reckoned in solar centuries as a unit.\r\n  Then,\r\n\r\n  Obliquity = 23 deg. 27' 31.68\" - 46.837\" T - 0.0085\" T^2 + 0.0017\" T^3.\r\n\r\n  From this expression is derived the value of the obliquity at various\r\n  epochs given in the following table. The left-hand portion of this\r\n  table gives the values for intervals of 500 years from 2000 B.C. to\r\n  A.D. 2500 as computed from modern data. For dates more than three or\r\n  four centuries before or after 1850 the result is necessarily\r\n  uncertain by one or more tenths of a minute, and is therefore only\r\n  given to 0.1'.\r\n\r\n    B.C. 2000; obl. = 23 deg. 55.5\"  A.D. 1700; obl. = 23 deg. 28' 41.91\"\r\n         1500   \"   = 23  52.3            1750   \"   = 23  28  18.51\r\n         1000   \"   = 23  48.9            1800   \"   = 23  27  55.10\r\n          500   \"   = 23  45.4            1850   \"   = 23  27  31.68\r\n            0   \"   = 23  41.7            1900   \"   = 23  27   8.26\r\n    A.D.  500   \"   = 23  38.0            1950   \"   = 23  26  44.84\r\n         1000   \"   = 23  34.1            2000   \"   = 23  26  21.41\r\n         1500   \"   = 23  30.3            2050   \"   = 23  25  57.99\r\n         2000   \"   = 23  26.4            2100   \"   = 23  25  34.56\r\n         2500   \"   = 23  22.5\r\n       (S.

[Greek: ekloge], a selection), in petrology, a typical\r\nmember of a small group of metamorphic rocks of special interest on\r\naccount of the variety of minerals they contain and their microscopic\r\nstructures and geological relationships. Typically they consist of pale\r\ngreen or nearly colourless augite (omphacite), green hornblende and pink\r\ngarnet. Quartz also is usually present in these rocks, but felspar is\r\nrare. The augite is mostly a variety of diopside and is only occasionally\r\nidiomorphic. The garnet sometimes forms good dodecahedra, but may occur\r\nas rounded grains, and encloses quartz, rutile, kyanite, and other\r\nminerals very frequently. The hornblende is usually pale green and feebly\r\ndichroic, but, in some eclogites which are allied to garnet-amphibolites,\r\nit is of dark brown colour. Among the commoner accessory minerals are\r\nkyanite (of blue or greyish-blue tints), rutile, biotite, epidote and\r\nzoisite, sphene, iron oxides, and pyrites. The rutile is invariably in\r\nsmall brown prisms; the kyanite forms bladed crystals, with perfect\r\ncleavage; felspar, if present, belongs to basic varieties rich in lime.\r\nOther minerals which have been found in eclogites are bronzite, olivine\r\nand glaucophane. The last mentioned is a bright blue variety of\r\nhornblende with striking pleochroism. The eclogites in their chemical\r\ncomposition show close affinities to gabbros; they often exhibit\r\nrelationships in the field which show that they were primarily intrusive\r\nrocks of igneous origin, and occasionally contact alteration can be\r\ntraced in the adjacent schists. Examples are known in Saxony, Bavaria,\r\nCarinthia, Austria, Norway. A few eclogites also occur in the north-west\r\nhighlands of Scotland. Glaucophane-eclogites have been met with in Italy\r\nand the Pennine Alps. Specimens of rock allied to eclogite have been\r\nfound in the diamantiferous peridotite breccias of South Africa (the\r\nso-called \"blue ground\"), and this has given rise to the theory that\r\nthese are the parent masses from which the Kimberley diamonds have come.\r\n     (J. S. F.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nECLOGUE, a short pastoral dialogue in verse. The word is conjectured to\r\nbe derived from the Greek verb [Greek: eklegein], to choose. An eclogue,\r\nperhaps, in its primary signification was a selected piece. Another more\r\nfantastic derivation traces it to [Greek: aix], goat, and [Greek:\r\nlogos], speech, and makes it a conversation of shepherds. The idea of\r\ndialogue, however, is not necessary for an eclogue, which is often not\r\nto be distinguished from the idyll. The grammarians, in giving this\r\ntitle to Virgil's pastoral conversations (_Bucolica_), tended to make\r\nthe term \"eclogue\" apply exclusively to dialogue, and this has in fact\r\nbeen the result of the success of Virgil's work. Latin eclogues were\r\nalso written by Calpurnius Siculus and by Nemesianus. In modern\r\nliterature the term has lost any distinctive character which it may have\r\npossessed among the Romans; it is merged in the general notion of\r\npastoral poetry. The French \"Eglogues\" of J.R. de Segrais (1624-1701)\r\nwere long famous, and those of the Spanish poet Garcilasso de La Vega\r\n(1503-1536) are still admired.\r\n\r\n  See also BUCOLICS; PASTORAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY, the name given to the study of insects based on\r\ntheir relation to man, his domestic animals and his crops, and, in the\r\ncase of those that are injurious, of the practical methods by which they\r\ncan be prevented from doing harm, or be destroyed when present. In Great\r\nBritain little attention is paid to this important branch of\r\nagricultural science, but in America and the British colonies the case\r\nis different. Nearly every state in America has its official economic\r\nentomologists, and nearly every one of the British crown colonies is\r\nprovided with one or more able men who help the agricultural community\r\nto battle against the insect pests. Most, if not all, of the important\r\nknowledge of remedies comes from America, where this subject reaches the\r\nhighest perfection; even the life-histories of some of the British pests\r\nhave been traced out in the United States and British colonies more\r\ncompletely than at home, from the creatures that have been introduced\r\nfrom Europe.\r\n\r\nSome idea of the importance of this subject may be gained from the\r\nfollowing figures. The estimated loss by the vine _Phylloxera_ in the\r\nGironde alone was L32,000,000; for all the French wine districts\r\nL100,000,000 would not cover the damage. It has been stated on good\r\nevidence that a loss of L7,000,000 per annum was caused by the attack of\r\nthe ox warble fly on cattle in England alone. In a single season\r\nAberdeenshire suffered nearly L90,000 worth of damage owing to the\r\nravages of the diamond back moth on the root crops; in New York state\r\nthe codling moth caused a loss of $3,000,000 to apple-growers. Yet these\r\nfigures are nothing compared to the losses due to scale insects, locusts\r\nand other pests.\r\n\r\n  The most able exponent of this subject in Great Britain was John\r\n  Curtis, whose treatise on _Farm Insects_, published in 1860, is still\r\n  the standard British work dealing with the insect foes of corn, roots,\r\n  grass and stored corn. The most important works dealing with fruit and\r\n  other pests come from the pens of Saunders, Lintner, Riley,\r\n  Slingerland and others in America and Canada, from Taschenberg, Lampa,\r\n  Reuter and Kollar in Europe, and from French, Froggatt and Tryon in\r\n  Australia. It was not until the last quarter of the 19th century that\r\n  any real advance was made in the study of economic entomology. Among\r\n  the early writings, besides the book of Curtis, there may also be\r\n  mentioned a still useful little publication by Pohl and Kollar,\r\n  entitled _Insects Injurious to Gardeners, Foresters and Farmers_,\r\n  published in 1837, and Taschenberg's _Praktische Insecktenkunde_.\r\n  American literature began as far back as 1788, when a report on the\r\n  Hessian fly was issued by Sir Joseph Banks; in 1817 Say began his\r\n  writings; while in 1856 Asa Fitch started his report on the \"Noxious\r\n  Insects of New York.\" Since that date the literature has largely\r\n  increased. Among the most important reports, &c., may be mentioned\r\n  those of C.V. Riley, published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture,\r\n  extending from 1878 to his death, in which is embodied an enormous\r\n  amount of valuable matter. At his death the work fell to Professor\r\n  L.O. Howard, who constantly issues brochures of equal value in the\r\n  form of Bulletins of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The chief\r\n  writings of J.A. Lintner extend from 1882 to 1898, in yearly parts,\r\n  under the title of _Reports on the Injurious Insects of the State of\r\n  New York_. Another author whose writings rank high on this subject is\r\n  M.V. Slingerland, whose investigations are published by Cornell\r\n  University. Among other Americans who have largely increased the\r\n  literature and knowledge must be mentioned F.M. Webster and E.P. Felt.\r\n  In 1883 appeared a work on fruit pests by William Saunders, which\r\n  mainly applies to the American continent; and another small book on\r\n  the same subject was published in 1898 by Miss Ormerod, dealing with\r\n  the British pests. In Australia Tryon published a work on the _Insect\r\n  and Fungus Enemies of Queensland_ in 1889. Many other papers and\r\n  reports are being issued from Australia, notably by Froggatt in New\r\n  South Wales. At the Cape excellent works and papers are prepared and\r\n  issued by the government entomologist, Dr Lounsbury, under the\r\n  auspices of the Agricultural Department; while from India we have\r\n  Cotes's _Notes on Economic Entomology_, published by the Indian Museum\r\n  in 1888, and other works, especially on tea pests.\r\n\r\nInjurious insects occur among the following orders: _Coleoptera_,\r\n_Hymenoptera_, _Lepidoptera_, _Diptera_, _Hemiptera_ (both _heteroptera_\r\nand _homoptera_), _Orthoptera_, _Neuroptera_ and _Thysanoptera_. The\r\norder _Aptera_ also contains a few injurious species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--A, Wireworm; B, pupa of Click Beetle; C, adult\r\nClick Beetle (_Agriotes lineatum_).]\r\n\r\nAmong the _Coleoptera_ or beetles there is a group of world-wide pests,\r\nthe _Elateridae_ or click beetles, the adults of the various\r\n\"wireworms.\" The insects in the larval or wireworm stage attack the\r\nroots of plants, eating them away below the ground. The eggs deposited\r\nby the beetle in the ground develop into yellowish-brown wire-like grubs\r\nwith six legs on the first three segments and a ventral prominence on\r\nthe anal segment. The life of these subterranean pests differs in the\r\nvarious species; some undoubtedly (_Agriotes lineatum_) live for three\r\nor four years, during the greater part of which time they gnaw away at\r\nthe roots of plants, carrying wholesale destruction before them. When\r\nmature they pass deep into the ground and pupate, appearing after a few\r\nmonths as the click beetles (fig. 1). Most crops are attacked by them,\r\nbut they are particularly destructive to wheat and other cereals. With\r\nsuch subterranean pests little can be done beyond rolling the land to\r\nkeep it firm, and thus preventing them from moving rapidly from plant to\r\nplant. A few crops, such as mustard, seem deleterious to them. By\r\ngrowing mustard and ploughing it in green the ground is made obnoxious\r\nto the wireworms, and may even be cleared of them. For root-feeders,\r\nbisulphide of carbon injected into the soil is of particular value. One\r\nounce injected about 2 ft. from an apple tree on two sides has been\r\nfound to destroy all the ground form of the woolly aphis. In garden\r\ncultivation it is most useful for wireworm, used at the rate of 1 ounce\r\nto every 4 sq. yds. It kills all root pests.\r\n\r\nIn Great Britain the flea beetles (_Halticidae_) are one of the most\r\nserious enemies; one of these, the turnip flea (_Phyllotreta nemorum_),\r\nhas in some years, notably 1881, caused more than L500,000 loss in\r\nEngland and Scotland alone by eating the young seedling turnips, cabbage\r\nand other _Cruciferae_. In some years three or four sowings have to be\r\nmade before a \"plant\" is produced, enormous loss in labour and cost of\r\nseed alone being thus involved. These beetles, characterized by their\r\nskipping movements and enlarged hind femora, also attack the hop\r\n(_Haltica concinna_), the vine in America (_Graptodera chalybea_,\r\nIllig.), and numerous other species of plants, being specially harmful\r\nto seedlings and young growth. Soaking the seed in strong-smelling\r\nsubstances, such as paraffin and turpentine, has been found efficacious,\r\nand in some districts paraffin sprayed over the seedlings has been\r\npractised with decided success. This oil generally acts as an excellent\r\npreventive of this and other insect attacks.\r\n\r\nIn all climates fruit and forest trees suffer from weevils or\r\n_Curculionidae_. The plum curculio (_Conotrachelus nenuphar_, Herbst) in\r\nAmerica causes endless harm in plum orchards; curculios in Australia\r\nravage the vines and fruit trees (_Orthorrhinus klugii_, Schon, and\r\n_Leptops hopei_, Bohm, &c.). In Europe a number of \"long-snouted\"\r\nbeetles, such as the raspberry weevils (_Otiorhynchus picipes_), the\r\napple blossom weevil (_Anthonomus pomorum_), attack fruit; others, as\r\nthe \"corn weevils\" (_Calandra oryzae_ and _C. granaria_), attack stored\r\nrice and corn; while others produce swollen patches on roots\r\n(_Ceutorhynchus sulcicollis_), &c. All these _Curculionidae_ are very\r\ntimid creatures, falling to the ground at the least shock. This habit\r\ncan be used as a means of killing them, by placing boards or sacks\r\ncovered with tar below the trees, which are then gently shaken. As many\r\nof these beetles are nocturnal, this trapping should take place at\r\nnight. Larval \"weevils\" mostly feed on the roots of plants, but some,\r\nsuch as the nut weevil (_Balaninus nucum_), live as larvae inside fruit.\r\nSeeds of various plants are also attacked by weevils of the family\r\n_Bruchidae_, especially beans and peas. These seed-feeders may be killed\r\nin the seeds by subjecting them to the fumes of bisulphide of carbon.\r\nThe corn weevils (_Calandra granaria_ and _C. oryzae_) are now found all\r\nover the world, in many cases rendering whole cargoes of corn useless.\r\n\r\nThe most important Hymenopterous pests are the sawflies or\r\n_Tenthredinidae_, which in their larval stage attack almost all\r\nvegetation. The larvae of these are usually spoken of as \"false\r\ncaterpillars,\" on account of their resemblance to the larvae of a moth.\r\nThey are most ravenous feeders, stripping bushes and trees completely of\r\ntheir foliage, and even fruit. Sawfly larvae can at once be recognized\r\nby the curious positions they assume, and by the number of pro-legs,\r\nwhich exceeds ten. The female lays her eggs in a slit made by means of\r\nher \"saw-like\" ovipositor in the leaf or fruit of a tree. The pupae in\r\nmost of these pests are found in an earthen cocoon beneath the ground,\r\nor in some cases above ground (_Lophyrus pini_). One species, the\r\nslugworm (_Eriocampa limacina_), is common to Europe and America; the\r\nlarva is a curious slug-like creature, found on the upper surface of the\r\nleaves of the pear and cherry, which secretes a slimy coating from its\r\nskin. Currant and gooseberry are also attacked by sawfly larvae\r\n(_Nematus ribesii_ and _N. ventricosus_) both in Europe and America.\r\nOther species attack the stalks of grasses and corn (_Cephus pygmaeus_).\r\nForest trees also suffer from their ravages, especially the conifers\r\n(_Lophyrus pini_). Another group of Hymenoptera occasionally causes much\r\nharm in fir plantations, namely, the _Siricidae_ or wood-wasps, whose\r\nlarvae burrow into the trunks of the trees and thus kill them. For all\r\nexposed sawfly larvae hellebore washes are most fatal, but they must not\r\nbe used over ripe or ripening fruit, as the hellebore is poisonous.\r\n\r\nThe order Diptera contains a host of serious pests. These two-winged\r\ninsects attack all kinds of plants, and also animals in their larval\r\nstage. Many of the adults are bloodsuckers (_Tabanidae_, _Culicidae_,\r\n&c.); others are parasitic in their larval stage (_Oestridae_, &c.). The\r\nbest-known dipterous pests are the Hessian fly (_Cecidomyia\r\ndestructor_), the pear midge (_Diplosis pyrivora_), the fruit flies\r\n(_Tephritis Tyroni_ of Queensland and _Halterophora capitata_ or the\r\nMediterranean fruit fly), the onion fly (_Phorbia cepetorum_), and\r\nnumerous corn pests, such as the gout fly (_Chloropstaeniopus_) and the\r\nfrit fly (_Oscinis frit_). Animals suffer from the ravages of bot flies\r\n(_Oestridae_) and gad flies (_Tabanidae_); while the tsetse disease is\r\ndue to the tsetse fly (_Glossina morsitans_), carrying the protozoa that\r\ncause the disease from one horse to another. Other flies act as\r\ndisease-carriers, including the mosquitoes (_Anopheles_), which not only\r\ncarry malarial germs, but also form a secondary host for these\r\nparasites. Hundreds of acres of wheat are lost annually in America by\r\nthe ravages of the Hessian fly; the fruit flies of Australia and South\r\nAfrica cause much loss to orange and citron growers, often making it\r\nnecessary to cover the trees in muslin tents for protection. Of animal\r\npests the ox warbles (_Hypoderma lineata_ and _H. bovis_) are the most\r\nimportant (see fig. 2). The \"bots\" or larvae of these flies live under\r\nthe skin of cattle, producing large swollen lumps--\"warbles\"--in which\r\nthe \"bots\" mature (fig. 2). These parasites damage the hide, set up\r\ninflammation, and cause immense loss to farmers, herdsmen and butchers.\r\nThe universal attack that has been made upon this pest has, however,\r\nlargely decreased its numbers. In America cattle suffer much from the\r\nhorn fly (_Haematobia serrata_). The dipterous garden pests, such as the\r\nonion fly, carrot fly and celery fly, can best be kept in check by the\r\nuse of paraffin emulsions and the treatment of the soil with gas-lime\r\nafter the crop is lifted. Cereal pests can only be treated by general\r\ncleanliness and good farming, and of course they are largely kept down\r\nby the rotation of crops.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--A, Ox Bot Maggot; B, puparium; C, Ox Warble Fly\r\n(_Hypoderma bovis_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--Looper-larva of Winter Moth (_Cheimatobia\r\nbrumata_).]\r\n\r\nLepidopterous enemies are numerous all over the world. Fruit suffers\r\nmuch from the larvae of the _Geometridae_, the so-called \"looper-larvae\"\r\nor \"canker-worms.\" Of these geometers the winter moth (_Cheimatobia\r\nbrumata_) is one of the chief culprits in Europe (fig. 3). The females\r\nin this moth and in others allied to it are wingless. These insects pass\r\nthe pupal stage in the ground, and reach the boughs to lay their eggs by\r\ncrawling up the trunks of the trees. To check them, \"grease-banding\"\r\nround the trees has been adopted; but as many other pests eat the\r\nleafage, it is best to kill all at once by spraying with arsenical\r\npoisons. Among other notable Lepidopterous pests are the \"surface\r\nlarvae\" or cutworms (_Agrotis spp._), the caterpillars of various\r\nNoctuae; the codling moth (_Carpocapsa pomonella_), which causes the\r\nmaggot in apples, has now become a universal pest, having spread from\r\nEurope to America and to most of the British Colonies. In many years\r\nquite half the apple crop is lost in England owing to the larvae\r\ndestroying the fruit. Sugar-canes suffer from the sugar-cane borer\r\n(_Diatioca sacchari_) in the West Indies; tobacco from the larvae of\r\nhawk moths (_Sphingidae_) in America; corn and grass from various\r\nLepidopterous pests all over the world. Nor are stored goods exempt, for\r\nmuch loss annually takes place in corn and flour from the presence of\r\nthe larvae of the Mediterranean flour moth (_Ephestia kuniella_); while\r\nfurs and clothes are often ruined by the clothes moth (_Tinea\r\ntrapezella_).\r\n\r\nBy far the most destructive insects in warm climates belong to the\r\nHemiptera, especially to the _Coccidae_ or scale insects. All fruit and\r\nforest trees suffer from these curious insects, which in the female sex\r\nalways remain apterous and apodal and live attached to the bark, leaf\r\nand fruit, hidden beneath variously formed scale-like coverings. The\r\nmale scales differ in form from the female; the adult male is winged,\r\nand is rarely seen. The female lays her eggs beneath the scaly covering,\r\nfrom which hatch out little active six-legged larvae, which wander about\r\nand soon begin to form a new scale. The _Coccidae_ can, and mainly do,\r\nbreed asexually (parthenogenetically). One of the most important is the\r\nSan Jose scale (_Aspidiotus perniciosus_), which in warm climates\r\nattacks all fruit and many other trees, which, if unmolested, it will\r\nsoon kill (fig. 4). These scales breed very rapidly; Howard states one\r\nmay give rise to a progeny of 3,216,080,400 in one year. Other scale\r\ninsects of note are the cosmopolitan mussel scale (_Mytilaspis pomorum_)\r\nand the Australian _Icerya purchasi_. The former attacks apple and pear;\r\nthe latter, which selects orange and citron, was introduced into America\r\nfrom Australia, and carried ruin before it in some orange districts\r\nuntil its natural enemy, the lady-bird beetle, _Vedalia cardinalis_, was\r\nalso imported.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--San Jose Scale (_Aspidiotus perniciosus_). A,\r\nMale scale insect; B, female; C, larva; D, female scale; E, male scale.]\r\n\r\nAfter the _Coccidae_ the next most important insects economically are\r\nthe plant lice or _Aphididae_. These breed with great rapidity under\r\nfavourable conditions: one by the end of the year will be accountable,\r\naccording to Linnaeus, for the enormous number of a quintillion of its\r\nspecies. Aphides are born, as a rule, alive, and the young soon commence\r\nto reproduce again. Their food consists mainly of the sap obtained from\r\nthe leaves and blossom of plants, but some also live on the roots of\r\nplants (_Phylloxera vastatrix_ and _Schizoneura lanigera_). Aphides\r\noften ruin whole crops of fruit, corn, hops, &c., by sucking out the\r\nsap, and not only check growth, but may even entail the death of the\r\nplant. Reproduction is mainly asexual, the females producing living\r\nyoung without the agency of a male. Males in nearly all species appear\r\nonce a year, when the last female generation, the ovigerous generation,\r\nis fertilized, and a few large ova are produced to carry on the\r\ncontinuity of the species over the winter. Some aphides live only on one\r\nspecies of plant, others on two or more plants. An example of the latter\r\nis seen in the hop aphis (_Phorodon humuli_), which passes the winter\r\nand lives on the sloe and damson in the egg stage until the middle of\r\nMay or later, and then flies off to the hops, where it causes endless\r\nharm all the summer (fig. 5); it flies back to the prunes to lay its\r\neggs when the hops are ripe. Another aphis of importance is the woolly\r\naphis (_Schizoneura lanigera_) of the apple and pear: it secretes tufts\r\nof white flocculent wool often to be seen hanging in patches from old\r\napple trees, where the insects live in the rough bark and form cankered\r\ngrowths both above and below ground. Aphides are provided with a mealy\r\nskin, which does not allow water to be attached to it, and thus\r\ninsecticides for destroying them contain soft soap, which fixes the\r\nsolution to the skin; paraffin is added to corrode the skin, and the\r\nsoft soap blocks up the breathing pores and so produces asphyxiation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--The Hop Aphis (_Phorodon humuli_). A, Winged\r\nfemale; B, winged male; C, ovigerous wingless female; D, viviparous\r\nwingless female from plum; E, pupal stage.]\r\n\r\nAmongst _Orthoptera_ we find many noxious insects, notably the locusts,\r\nwhich travel in vast cloud-like armies, clearing the whole country\r\nbefore them of all vegetable life. The most destructive locust is the\r\nmigratory locust (_Locusta migratoria_), which causes wholesale\r\ndestruction in the East. Large pits are dug across the line of advance\r\nof these great insect armies to stop them when in the larval or wingless\r\nstage, and even huge bonfires are lighted to check their flight when\r\nadult. So dense are these \"locust clouds\" that they sometimes quite\r\ndarken the air. The commonest and most widely distributed migratory\r\nlocust is _Pachytylus cinerascens_. The mole cricket (_Gryllotalpa\r\nvulgaris_) and various cockroaches (_Blattidae_) are also amongst the\r\npests found in this order.\r\n\r\nOf _Neuroptera_ there are but few injurious species, and many, such as\r\nthe lace wing flies (_Hemerobiidae_), are beneficial.\r\n\r\n_The Treatment of Insect Pests._--One of the most important ways of\r\nkeeping insect pests in check is by \"spraying\" or \"washing.\" This method\r\nhas made great advances in recent years. All the pioneer work has been\r\ndone in America; in fact, until the South-Eastern Agricultural College\r\nundertook the elucidation of this subject, little was known of it in\r\nEngland except by a few growers. The results and history of this\r\nessential method of treatment are embodied in Professor Lodemann's work\r\non the _Spraying of Plants_, 1896. In this treatment we have to bear in\r\nmind what the entomologist teaches us, that is, the nature, habits and\r\nstructure of the pest.\r\n\r\n  For insects provided with a biting mouth, which take nourishment from\r\n  the whole leaf, shoot or fruit, the poisonous washes used are chiefly\r\n  arsenical. The two most useful arsenical sprays are Paris green and\r\n  arsenate of lead. To make the former, mix 1 oz. of the Paris green\r\n  with 15 gallons of soft water, and add 2 oz. of lime and a small\r\n  quantity of agricultural treacle; the latter is prepared by dissolving\r\n  3 oz. of acetate of lead in a little water, then 1 oz. of arsenate of\r\n  soda in water and mixing the two well together, and adding the whole\r\n  to 16 gallons of soft water; to this is added a small quantity of\r\n  coarse treacle. For piercing-mouthed pests like _Aphides_ no wash is\r\n  of use unless it contains a basis of soft soap. This soft-soap wash\r\n  kills by contact, and may be prepared in the following way:--Dissolve\r\n  6 to 8 lb. of the best soft soap in boiling soft water and while still\r\n  hot (but of course taken off the fire) add 1 gallon of paraffin oil\r\n  and churn well together with a force-pump; the whole may then be mixed\r\n  with 100 gallons of soft water. The oil readily separates from the\r\n  water, and thus a perfect emulsion is not obtained: this difficulty\r\n  has been solved by Mr Cousin's paraffin naphthalene wash, which is\r\n  patented, but can be made for private use. It is prepared as\r\n  follows:--Soft soap, 6 lb. dissolved in 1 quart of water; naphthalene,\r\n  10 oz. mixed with 1-1/2 pint of paraffin; the whole is mixed together.\r\n  When required for use, 1 lb. of the compound is dissolved in 5 to 10\r\n  gallons of warm water.\r\n\r\n  These two washes are essential to the well-being of every orchard in\r\n  all climates. Not only can we now destroy larval and adult insects,\r\n  but we can also attack them in the egg stage by the use of a caustic\r\n  alkali wash during the winter; besides destroying the eggs of such\r\n  pests as the _Psyllidae_, red spider, and some aphides, this also\r\n  removes the vegetal encumbrances which shelter numerous other insect\r\n  pests during the cold part of the year. Caustic alkali wash is\r\n  prepared by dissolving 1 lb. of crude potash and 1 lb. of caustic soda\r\n  in soft water, mixing the two solutions together, adding to them 3/4\r\n  lb. of soft soap, and diluting with 10 gallons of soft water when\r\n  required for use. Another approved insecticide for scale insects is\r\n  resin wash, which acts in two ways: first, corroding the soft scales,\r\n  and second, fixing the harder scales to stop the egress of the hexapod\r\n  larvae. It is prepared as follows:--First crush 8 lb. of resin in a\r\n  sack, and then place the resin in warm water and boil in a cauldron\r\n  until thoroughly dissolved; then melt 10 lb. of caustic soda in enough\r\n  warm water to keep it liquid, and mix with the dissolved resin; keep\r\n  stirring until the mixture assumes a clear coffee-colour, and for ten\r\n  minutes afterwards; then add enough warm water to bring the whole up\r\n  to 25 gallons, and well stir. Bottle this off, and when required for\r\n  use dilute with three times its bulk of warm soft water, and spray\r\n  over the trees in the early spring just before the buds burst. For\r\n  mites (_Acari_) sulphur is the essential ingredient of a spray. Liver\r\n  of sulphur has been found to be the best form, especially when mixed\r\n  with a paraffin emulsion. Bud mites (_Phytoptidae_, fig. 6) are of\r\n  course not affected. Sulphur wash is made by adding to every 10\r\n  gallons of warm paraffin emulsion or paraffin-naphthalene-emulsion 7\r\n  oz. of liver of sulphur, and stirring until the sulphur is well mixed.\r\n  This is applied as an ordinary spray. Nursery stock should always be\r\n  treated, to kill scale, aphis and other pests which it may carry, by\r\n  the gas treatment, particularly in the case of stock imported from a\r\n  foreign climate. This treatment, both out of doors and under glass, is\r\n  carried out as follows:--Cover the plants in bulk with a light\r\n  gas-tight cloth, or put them in a special fumigating house, and then\r\n  place 1 oz. of cyanide of potassium in lumps in a dish with water\r\n  beneath the covering, and then pour 1 oz. of sulphuric acid over it\r\n  (being careful not to inhale the poisonous fumes) for every 1000 cub.\r\n  ft. of space beneath the cover. The gas generated, prussic acid,\r\n  should be left to work for at least an hour before the stock is\r\n  removed, when all forms of animal life will be destroyed.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 6.--Bud Mites (_Phytoptidae_). A, Currant Bud Mite\r\n  (_Phytoptus ribis_); B, Nut Bud Mite (_P. avellanae_).]\r\n\r\n  For spraying, proper instruments must be used, by means of which the\r\n  liquid is sent out over the plants in as fine a mist as possible.\r\n  Numerous pumps and nozzles are now made by which this end is attained.\r\n  Both horse and hand machines are employed, the former for hops and\r\n  large orchards, the latter for bush fruit and gardens. In America,\r\n  where trees in parks as well as orchards and gardens are treated,\r\n  steam-power is sometimes used. Among the most important sprayers are\r\n  the Strawson horse sprayers and the smaller Eclair and Notus knapsack\r\n  pumps, carried on the back (fig. 7). The nozzles for \"mistifying\" the\r\n  wash most in use are known as the Vermorel and Riley's, which can be\r\n  fitted to any length of tubing, so as to reach any height, and can be\r\n  turned in any direction. The pumps in the machine keep the insecticide\r\n  constantly mixed, and at the same time force the wash with great\r\n  strength through the nozzle, and so to the exterior, as a fine mist;\r\n  every part of the plant is thus affected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--Knapsack Sprayer for Liquid Insecticides.]\r\n\r\n_Beneficial Insects_ have also to be considered in economic entomology.\r\nThey are of two kinds--(1) those that help to keep down an excess of\r\nother insects by acting either as parasites or by being insectivorous in\r\nhabit; and (2) insects of economic value, such as the bee and silkworm.\r\nAmongst the most important friends to the farmer and gardener are the\r\nHymenopterous families of ichneumon flies (_Ichneumonidae_ and\r\n_Braconidae_); the Dipterous families _Syrphidae_ and _Tachinidae_; the\r\nColeopterous families _Coccinellidae_ and _Carabidae_; and the\r\nNeuropterous _Hemerobiidae_, or lace-wing flies. Ichneumon flies lay\r\ntheir eggs either in the larvae or ova of other insects, and the\r\nparasites destroy their host. In this way the Hessian fly is doubtless\r\nkept in check in Europe, and the aphides meet with serious hindrance to\r\ntheir increase. If a number of plant-lice are examined, a few will be\r\nfound looking like little pearls; these are the dried skins of those\r\nthat have been killed by _Ichneumonidae_. The _Syrphidae_, or hover\r\nflies, are almost exclusively aphis-feeders in their larval stage.\r\n_Tachina_ flies attack lepidopterous larvae. One of the most notable\r\nexamples of the use of insect allies is the case of the Australian\r\nlady-bird, _Vedalia cardinalis_, which, in common with all lady-birds,\r\nfeeds off _Aphidae_ and _Coccidae_. The Icerya scale (_Icerya purchasi_)\r\nimported into America ruined the orange groves, but its enemy, the\r\n_Vedalia_, was also imported from Australia, and counteracted its\r\nabnormal increase with such great results that the crippled orange\r\ngroves are now once more profitable.     (F. V. T.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMICS (from the Gr. [Greek: oikonomike], sc. [Greek: techne], from\r\n[Greek: oikos], a house, and [Greek: nomos], rule,--the \"art of\r\nhousehold management\"), the general term, with its synonym \"political\r\neconomy,\" for the science or study of wealth (welfare) and its\r\nproduction, applicable either to the individual, the family, the State,\r\nor in the widest sense, the world. How far the same considerations apply\r\nto all these spheres is one of the problems of economic thought in its\r\nwidest sense. The term \"economy\" (q.v.) by itself, which should strictly\r\nmean the art of applying money (or wealth) wisely, has commonly come to\r\nmean the art of saving money, or spending as little as possible. In\r\npractice the study of \"political\" economy is mainly devoted to the\r\nsphere of the State; the welfare of the individual as a member of the\r\nState, and of the State in its relation to the world, being internal\r\naspects of the prosperity of the State itself. Economics thus includes\r\nthe discussion of all the numerous factors which make life profitable,\r\nwhether to the nation or to the business, or to the individual man. It\r\nmay be conceived either as an historical science (What principles have\r\nin fact paid?), or as an abstract science (What are the true principles\r\nwhich must pay, presupposing an ideal?). Economists at different times\r\nhave studied both aspects, according to their lights, and influenced by\r\nhistorical conditions of philosophic thought. A text-book on economics\r\nnecessarily deals, therefore, with the whole subject in a manner which\r\nneed not here be followed, since separate articles are devoted in this\r\nwork to the biographies of writers on economics, and also to the\r\nprincipal economic questions involved, under their own headings. In\r\nthis article we propose therefore to confine ourselves to discussing the\r\ncharacter and subject-matter of the science, indicating its relation to\r\nother sciences, and explaining the methods by which economists reach\r\ntheir conclusions.\r\n\r\nWe understand by economics the science which investigates the manner in\r\nwhich nations or other larger or smaller communities, and their\r\nindividual members, obtain food, clothing, shelter and whatever else is\r\nconsidered desirable or necessary for the maintenance and improvement of\r\nthe conditions of life. It is thus the study of the life of communities\r\nwith special reference to one side of their activity. It necessarily\r\ninvolves the scientific examination of the structure and organization of\r\nthe community or communities in question; their history, their customs,\r\nlaws and institutions; and the relations between their members, in so\r\nfar as they affect or are affected by this department of their activity.\r\n\r\nAt the root of all economic investigation lies the conception of the\r\nstandard of life of the community. By this expression we do not mean an\r\nideal mode of living, but the habits and requirements of life generally\r\ncurrent in a community or grade of society at a given period. The\r\nstandard of life of the ordinary well-to-do middle class in England, for\r\nexample, includes not only food, clothing and shelter of a kind\r\ndifferent in many respects from that of a similar class in other\r\ncountries and of other classes in England, but a highly complicated\r\nmechanism, both public and private, for ministering to these primary\r\nneeds, habits of social intercourse, educational and sanitary\r\norganization, recreative arrangements and many other elements. Many\r\ninfluences operating for a long period of time on the character and the\r\nenvironment of a class go to determine its standard of life. In a modern\r\nindustrial community it is possible to express this standard fairly\r\naccurately for the purposes of economic investigation in terms of money\r\n(q.v.). But it is doubtful whether the most complete investigation would\r\never enable us to include all the elements of the standard of life in a\r\nmoney estimate. The character, tastes and capacity for management of\r\ndifferent individuals and groups differ so widely that equal incomes do\r\nnot necessarily imply identity of standard. In the investigation of past\r\ntimes, the incommensurate elements of well-being are so numerous that\r\nmerely money estimates are frequently misleading. The conception of the\r\nstandard of life involves also some estimate of the efforts and\r\nsacrifices people are prepared to make to obtain it; of their ideals and\r\ncharacter; of the relative strength of the different motives which\r\nusually determine their conduct. But no carefully devised calculus can\r\ntake the place of insight, observation and experience. The economist\r\nshould be a man of wide sympathies and practical sagacity, in close\r\ntouch with men of different grades, and, if possible, experienced in\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Character of subject-matter.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that no permanent classification is possible of what is or\r\nis not of economic significance. No general rules, applicable to all\r\ntimes, can be laid down as to what phenomena must be examined or what\r\nmay be neglected in economic inquiry. The different departments of human\r\nactivity are organically connected, and all facts relating to the life\r\nof a community have a near or remote economic significance. For short\r\nhistorical periods, indeed, many phenomena are so remotely connected\r\nwith the ordinary business of life that we may ignore them. But at any\r\nmoment special causes may bring into the field of economic inquiry whole\r\ndepartments of life which have hitherto been legitimately ignored. In\r\ntimes past, biblical exegesis, religious ideals, and ecclesiastical\r\norganization, the purely political aims of statesmen, chance\r\ncombinations of party politics and the intrigues of diplomatists, class\r\nprejudice, social conventions, apparently sudden changes of economic\r\npolicy, capricious changes of fashion--all these causes and many others\r\nhave exerted a direct and immediate influence on the economic life of\r\nthe community. In our own day we have had many illustrations of the\r\nmanner in which special circumstances may at once bring an almost\r\nunnoticed series of scientific investigations into direct and vital\r\nrelation with the business world. The economist must, therefore, not\r\nonly be prepared to take account of the physical features of the world,\r\nthe general structure and organization of the industry and commerce of\r\ndifferent states, the character of their administration and other\r\nimportant causes of economic change. He must be in touch with the actual\r\nlife of the community he is studying, and cultivate \"that openness and\r\nalertness of the mind, that sensitiveness of the judgment, which can\r\nrapidly grasp the significance of at first sight unrelated discoveries\r\nor events.\"\r\n\r\nSome people are of opinion that the factors to be taken account of in\r\neconomic investigation are so numerous that progress on these lines is\r\nimpossible. It would certainly be impossible if we had to begin _de\r\nnovo_ to construct the whole fabric of economic science. But, as we\r\nshall see, it is no more necessary to do this in the world of science\r\nthan it is in the world of business or politics. There is in existence a\r\nvast store of accumulated knowledge, and few, if any, departments of\r\neconomics have been left quite unilluminated by the researches of former\r\ngenerations. Progress is the result of adaptation rather than\r\nreconstruction. It must be remembered also that economic work in modern\r\ntimes is carried on by consciously or unconsciously associated effort,\r\nand although it must always require high qualities of judgment, capacity\r\nand energy, many of the difficulties which at first sight appear so\r\ninsuperable give way when they are attacked. In some ways also the study\r\nof highly developed organizations like the modern industrial state is\r\nsimpler than that of earlier forms of society.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ancient and modern conditions in England.\r\n\r\nIn the earliest times for which we have abundant material the economic\r\nlife of England had already reached in certain directions a high degree\r\nof complexity. Even in the rural districts, manorial records reveal the\r\nexistence of a great variety of classes and groups of persons engaged in\r\nthe performance of economic functions. The lord of the manor with his\r\nofficials and retainers, the peasantry bound to him by ties of personal\r\ndependence and mutual rights and obligations, constituted a little\r\nworld, in which we can watch the play of motives and passions not so\r\ndissimilar as we are sometimes led to believe from those of the great\r\nmodern world. In many a country district the gradations of social rank\r\nwere more continuous, the opportunities of intercourse more frequent,\r\nand the capacity for organization greater than in modern times. The\r\nmanorial accounts were kept with precision and detail, and we are told\r\nthat a skilled official could estimate to the utmost farthing the value\r\nof the services due from the villein to his lord. The manor was indeed\r\nself-sufficient and independent in the sense that it could furnish\r\neverything required by the majority of the inhabitants, and that over\r\nthe greater part of rural England production was not carried on with a\r\nview to a distant market. But in the earliest times the manor was\r\nsubjected to external influences of great importance. Vast areas of the\r\ncountry were in fact under the single control of a territorial lord or\r\nan ecclesiastical foundation. Every manor composing these great fiefs\r\nwas likely to be affected by the policy or the character of the\r\nadministration of the feudal lord, and he, again, by the policy or the\r\ndifficulties, the strength or the weakness, of the central government.\r\nForeign trade and foreign intercourse were undeveloped, but their\r\ninfluence was in historical times never entirely absent, while the\r\ninfluence of Roman law and the Christian Church constantly tended to\r\nmodify the manorial organization. In the towns the division of labour\r\nhad proceeded much further than in the rural districts, and there were\r\nin existence organized bodies, such as the Gild Merchant and the crafts,\r\nwhose functions were primarily economic. But one of the most striking\r\ncharacteristics of town life in the middle ages was the manner in which\r\nmunicipal and industrial privileges and responsibilities were\r\ninterwoven. In modern times the artisan, however well trained, efficient\r\nand painstaking he may be, does not, in virtue of these qualities, enjoy\r\nany municipal or political privileges. By means of his trade union,\r\nco-operative society or club he may gain some experience in the\r\nmanagement of men and business, and in so far as the want of a\r\nsufficient income does not constitute an insuperable difficulty, he may\r\nshare in the public life of the country. But in his character as\r\nartisan he enjoys no municipal or political privileges. In the middle\r\nages this differentiation of the industrial, municipal and political\r\nlife had not taken place, and in order to understand the working of at\r\nfirst sight purely economic regulations it is necessary to make a close\r\nstudy of the functions of local government. But this, after all, does\r\nnot carry us very far. From the very nature of the records in which we\r\nstudy the town life of the middle ages, it follows that we obtain from\r\nthem only a one-sided view. No one knows what proportion of the\r\nindustrial population was included in the organized gilds, or how\r\ncomplete was the control exercised by these bodies over their members.\r\nElaborate regulations were in force, but no one knows how elastic they\r\nwere in practice. Medieval Englishmen were particularly apt to put their\r\naspirations into a legal form, and then rest satisfied with their\r\nachievement. The number of regulations is scarcely to be regarded as a\r\ntest of their administrative success. Further, as the country became\r\nmore consolidated and the central government extended its authority over\r\neconomic affairs, new regulations came into force, new organs of\r\ngovernment appeared, which were sometimes in conflict, sometimes in\r\nharmony, with the existing system, and it becomes for a time far more\r\ndifficult to obtain a clear view of the actual working of economic\r\ninstitutions. Thus the study of the economic life of the middle ages is\r\none of the most complicated subjects which can engage the attention of\r\nman. It is impossible to carry the process of isolation very far. The\r\ndifferent threads of social activity are so closely interwoven that we\r\ncannot follow any one for very long without forming wrong impressions,\r\nand it becomes necessary to turn back and study others which seemed at\r\nfirst sight unrelated to the subject of our investigations. Under an\r\napparently uniform and stable system of social regulation there was much\r\nvariation and movement, the significance of which it is impossible to\r\nestimate. Materials for forming such an estimate no doubt exist, but\r\nbefore doing so we have to study in infinite detail a vast number of\r\nseparate manors, municipalities or other separate economic areas. This\r\ninvolves great industry on the part of many scientific workers.\r\nMeanwhile we can _illustrate_ the economic life of the middle ages,\r\ndescribe its main features, indicate the more important measures of\r\npublic policy and draw attention to some of the main lines of\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Conditions of economic science.\r\n\r\nIt is only as we approach more modern times that the conditions of\r\neconomic study are realized and economic science, as we understand it,\r\nbecomes possible. Those conditions are: (i.) the life of the state or\r\nother community or communities we are studying must be so differentiated\r\nthat we can isolate those functions which are wholly or predominantly\r\neconomic. The \"separation of employments\" is not only a condition of\r\neconomic efficiency; it was necessary before we could have an economic\r\nscience. (ii.) We must be in a position so far to understand and\r\nestimate the character and motives of different classes and groups in\r\nthese communities that we can rightly interpret their action. This\r\ncondition cannot be realized without great difficulty, for \"economic\r\nmotives\" are very different in different periods, nations and classes,\r\nand even for short periods of time in the same country are modified by\r\nthe influence of other motives of an entirely different order. In\r\nstudying the economic history of the 18th century, for example, it is\r\nnot enough to assume with Defoe that \"gain is the design of\r\nmerchandise.\" We have to be saturated, as it were, with 18th-century\r\ninfluences, so that we can realize the conditions in which industry and\r\ntrade were carried on, before we can rightly explain the course of\r\ndevelopment. In our own day labour disputes, to take another example,\r\ncan scarcely ever be resolved into a question of merely pecuniary gain\r\nor loss. The significance of the amount of money involved varies greatly\r\nfor different trades, and can only be understood by reference to the\r\ncharacter and habits of the people concerned. But questions of\r\nsentiment, shop-feeling and trade customs invariably play an important\r\npart. (iii.) Economics can never lead to anything but hypothetical\r\nresults unless we not only realize that we must \"take account of\" other\r\nthan the purely economic factors, but also give due weight and\r\nsignificance to these factors. No explanation of the industrial\r\nsituation in Germany, for example, would be intelligible or satisfactory\r\neven from the economic point of view which ignored the significance of\r\nthe political conditions which Germans have to deal with. So, again, it\r\nis impossible to make a useful comparative estimate of the advantages\r\nand disadvantages of the transport systems of England, the United States\r\nand Germany, unless we keep constantly in view the very different\r\ngeographical, military and political conditions which these systems have\r\nto satisfy. (iv.) Sufficient information must be available to enable us\r\nto test the validity of our hypotheses and conclusions. Whatever\r\n\"method\" of economic investigation we employ, we must at every stage see\r\nhow far our reasoning is borne out by the actual experience of life.\r\nThis obvious condition of scientific inquiry is very far from being\r\ncompletely realized even at the present time. It implies the existence\r\nof a well-trained class engaged in the work of collecting information,\r\nand much organization both by the state and private bodies. These four\r\nconditions can be reduced to two. The community we are studying must\r\nhave reached such a stage of development that its economic functions and\r\nthose immediately cognate to them form a well-defined group, and\r\nadequate means must be available so that we can, as it were, watch the\r\nperformance of these functions and test our hypotheses and conclusions\r\nby observation and experience.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand, therefore, why we trace the beginnings of\r\neconomics, so far as England is concerned, in the 16th century, and why\r\nthe application of strict scientific tests in this subject of human\r\nstudy has become possible only in comparatively recent times. Medieval\r\neconomics was little more than a casuistical system of elaborate and\r\nsomewhat artificial rules of conduct. From the close of the middle ages\r\nuntil the middle of the 18th century thousands of pamphlets and other\r\nworks on economic questions were published, but the vast majority of the\r\nwriters have little or no scientific importance. Their works frequently\r\ncontain information given nowhere else, and throw much light on the\r\nstate of opinion in the age in which they wrote. It is also possible to\r\nfind in them many anticipations of the views of the economists of later\r\ntimes; but such statements were as a rule generated merely by the heat\r\nof controversy on some measure or event of practical importance, and\r\nwhen the controversy died down were seldom regarded or incorporated in a\r\nscientific system. Trade bias, personal impressions and guesswork took\r\nthe place of scientific method. This was inevitable in the absence of\r\ntrustworthy information on an adequate scale, and from the immediately\r\npractical aims of the writers. But from the end of the 17th century\r\neconomics has been definitely recognized as a subject of scientific\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Necessity of economic science.\r\n\r\nIn modern times the conditions which have made economic science possible\r\nhave also made it necessary. While it is impossible to give a strictly\r\neconomic interpretation of the earlier history of nations, economic\r\ninterests so govern the life and determine the policy of modern states\r\nthat other forces, like those of religion and politics, seem to play\r\nonly a subsidiary part, modifying here and there the view which is taken\r\nof particular questions, but not changing in any important degree the\r\ngeneral course of their development. This may be, in the historical\r\nsense, merely a passing phase of human progress, due to the rapid\r\nextension of the industrial revolution to all the civilized and many of\r\nthe uncivilized nations of the world, bringing in its train the\r\nconsolidation of large areas, a similarity of conditions within them,\r\nand amongst peoples and governments a great increase in the strength of\r\neconomic motives. When the world has settled down to the new conditions,\r\nif it ever does so, we may be confronted with problems similar to those\r\nwhich our forefathers had to solve. But, for the time, if we know the\r\neconomic interests of nations, classes and individuals, we can tell with\r\nmore accuracy than ever before how in the long run they will act. Public\r\npolicy therefore requires the closest possible study of the economic\r\nforces which are moulding the destinies of the great nations of the\r\nworld. In most civilized countries except England this is recognized,\r\nand adequate provision is made for the study of economic science. But\r\nthe subject is not only of immediate concern to the state in its\r\ncorporate and public capacity. The neglect of it in the domain of\r\nprivate business can now only lead to disastrous results. To quote from\r\na useful work (_National Education: a Symposium_, 1901), \"the commercial\r\nsupremacy of England was due to a variety of causes, of which superior\r\nintelligence, in the ordinary business sense, was not the most\r\nimportant. Her insular position, continuity of political development and\r\nfreedom from domestic broils played an important part in bringing about\r\na steady and continuous growth of industry and manufactures for several\r\ngenerations before the modern era. The great wars of the 18th and the\r\nbeginning of the 19th century, which arrested the growth of continental\r\nnations, gave England the control of the markets of the world. When\r\npeace was restored, England enjoyed something in the nature of a\r\nmonopoly. The competition of France ceased for a time to be an important\r\nfactor. What is now the German empire was a mere congeries of small\r\nstates, waging perpetual tariff wars upon each other. In the old\r\nPrussian provinces alone there were fifty-three different customs\r\nfrontiers, and German manufactures could not develop until the growth of\r\nthe Zollverein brought with it commercial consolidation, internal\r\nfreedom and greater homogeneity of economic conditions. The industries\r\nof the United States were in their infancy. Thus the productive power of\r\nEngland was unrivalled, and her manufactures and business men, under a\r\nregime rapidly approximating to complete freedom of trade, could reap\r\nthe full advantages to be derived from the possession of great national\r\nresources and production by machinery. Commercial supremacy required not\r\nso much highly trained intelligence amongst manufacturers and merchants\r\nas keen business instinct and a certain rude energy. In the last\r\ngeneration all that has changed, and the change is of a permanent\r\ncharacter. The struggle of the future must inevitably be between a\r\nnumber of great nations, more or less equally well equipped, carrying on\r\nproduction by the same general methods, each one trying to strengthen\r\nits industrial and commercial position by the adoption of the most\r\nhighly developed machinery, and all the methods suggested by scientific\r\nresearch, policy or experience. Under these conditions, it is no longer\r\npossible for the individual merchant, or for small groups of merchants,\r\nto acquaint themselves, by personal experience alone, with more than a\r\nfractional part of the causes which affect the business in which they\r\nare engaged. The spread of the modern industrial system has brought with\r\nit the modern state, with its millions of consumers, its vast area, its\r\ninnumerable activities, its complicated code of industrial and\r\ncommercial law. At the same time, the revolution in the means of\r\ntransport and communication has destroyed, or is tending to destroy,\r\nlocal markets, and closely interwoven all the business of the world.\r\nEvents in the most distant countries, industrial and commercial\r\nmovements at first sight unrelated to the concerns of the individual\r\nmerchant, now exert a direct and immediate influence upon his interests.\r\nThe technical training of the factory or the office, the experience of\r\nbusiness, the discharge of practical duties, necessary as they are, do\r\nnot infallibly open the mind to the large issues of the modern business\r\nworld, and can never confer the detailed acquaintance with facts and\r\nprinciples which lie outside the daily routine of the individual, but\r\nare none the less of vital importance.\" Economics, therefore, under\r\nmodern conditions, is not only a subject which may usefully occupy the\r\nattention of a leisured class of scientific men. It should form part of\r\nthe training of educated men of all classes, on grounds of public policy\r\nand administrative and business efficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Relations between economics and other sciences.\r\n\r\nThe relations between economics and other sciences cannot be stated in a\r\nvery general form. They vary for different periods, and are not the same\r\nfor all branches of economics. There is no subject of human study which\r\nmay not be at some time or other of economic significance, and anything\r\nwhich affects the character, the ideals or the environment of man may\r\nmake it necessary to modify our assumptions and our reasoning with\r\nregard to his conduct in economic affairs. But if the economist, while\r\nstudying one side of man's activities, must also cultivate all other\r\nbranches of human learning, it is obvious that no substantial progress\r\ncan be made. The economist frankly assumes the reality of the existing\r\nworld and takes men as they are, or as they have been if he is studying\r\npast times. His assumptions are based upon ordinary observation and\r\nexperience, and are usually accurate in proportion to his practical\r\nshrewdness and sagacity, so that he is not interested in the speculative\r\nflights of philosophy, except in so far as they influence or have\r\ninfluenced conduct. In times past, and to a less extent in our own day,\r\nphilosophical conceptions have formed the basis of great systems of\r\npolitics and economics. The historical relations between philosophy and\r\neconomics are of great importance in tracing the development of the\r\nlatter, and have done much to determine its present form. But the modern\r\nconception of society or the state owes more to biology than philosophy,\r\nand actual research has destroyed more frequently than it has justified\r\nthe assumptions of the older philosophical school. Experimental\r\npsychology may in course of time have an important bearing on economics,\r\nbut the older science cannot be said to be of much significance except\r\nin its historical aspects. Ethics is in much the same position. That is,\r\nit is possible to conceive of an ethical science which would extend\r\nconsiderably our knowledge of economic affairs, but no important new\r\nprinciple or original discovery, relevant to economic investigation, has\r\ncome from that quarter in recent years, and at present ethics has more\r\nto learn from economics than the latter has from ethics. It is in the\r\nadaptation of biological conceptions and methods, in the positive\r\ncontributions of jurisprudence, law and history, in the rigorous\r\napplication, where possible, of quantitative tests, that the explanation\r\nof the present position of economics is to be found. Mathematics has\r\ninfluenced the form and the terminology of the science, and has\r\nsometimes been useful in analysis; but mathematical methods of\r\nreasoning, in their application to economics, while possessing a certain\r\nfascination, are of very doubtful utility.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Method of economic investigation.\r\n\r\nThere is no method of investigation which is peculiarly economic or of\r\nwhich economics has the monopoly. In every age economists have applied\r\nthe methods ordinarily in use amongst scientific men. There would\r\nprobably have been no controversy at all on this subject but for the\r\nfact that economics was elaborated into systematic form, and made the\r\nbasis of practical measures of the greatest importance, long before the\r\nremarkable development in the 19th century of historical research,\r\nexperimental science and biology. The application of the _a priori_\r\nmethod in economics was an accident, due to its association with other\r\nsubjects and the general backwardness of other sciences rather than any\r\nexceptional and peculiar character in the subject-matter of the science\r\nitself. The methods applied to economics in the 18th and the early part\r\nof the 19th century were no more invented with a special view to that\r\nsubject than the principles of early railway legislation, in the domain\r\nof practical policy, were devised with a special view to what was then a\r\nnew means of transport. As a matter of fact, discussions of method and\r\nthe criticism of hypotheses and assumptions are very rarely found in\r\nearly economic works. It is only by reference to the prevailing ideas in\r\nphilosophy and politics that we can discover what was in the minds of\r\ntheir authors. The growth of a science is much like the growth of a\r\nconstitution. It proceeds by adaptation and precedent. The scientific\r\nand historical movement of the 19th century was revolutionary in\r\ncharacter. When it began to affect economics, many people were afraid\r\nthat the whole fabric of science would be destroyed and the practical\r\ngains it had achieved, jeopardized. These fears were justified, in so\r\nfar as those who entertained them shut their eyes to everything new and\r\nassumed an attitude of no compromise. Where the newer methods were\r\nassimilated, the position of economics was strengthened and its\r\npractical utility increased. General discussion of method, however, is\r\nrarely profitable. In all branches of economics, even in what is called\r\nthe pure theory, there is an implied reference to certain historical or\r\nexisting conditions of a more or less definite character; to the\r\nestablished order of an organized state or other community, at a stage\r\nof development which in its main features can be recognized. In all\r\neconomic investigation assumptions must be made, but we must see that\r\nthey are legitimate in view of the actual life and character of the\r\ncommunity or communities which are the subject of investigation. In\r\ncommon with other sciences, economics makes use of \"abstractions\"; but\r\nif for some problems we employ symbolic processes of reasoning, we must\r\nkeep clearly in view the limits of their significance, and neither endow\r\nthe symbols with attributes they can never possess, nor lose sight of\r\nthe realities behind them. Every hypothesis must be tested by an appeal\r\nto the facts of life, and modified or abandoned if it will not bear\r\nexamination, unless we are convinced on genuine evidence that it may for\r\na time be employed as a useful approximation, without prejudice to the\r\nlater stages of the investigation we are conducting.\r\n\r\n\r\n  An illustration of economic method.\r\n\r\nWe shall best illustrate the character and method of economic reasoning\r\nby examples, and for that purpose let us take first of all a purely\r\nhistorical problem, namely, the effect on the wage-earners of the wages\r\nclauses of the Statute of Apprenticeship (1563). It is at once obvious\r\nthat we are dealing not with an abstract scheme of regulation in a\r\nhypothetical world, but with an act of parliament nominally in force for\r\ntwo hundred and fifty years, and applicable to a great variety of trades\r\nwhose organization and history can be ascertained. The conclusions we\r\nreach may or may not modify any opinions we have formed as to the manner\r\nin which wages are determined under modern conditions. For the time\r\nbeing such opinions are irrelevant to the question we are investigating,\r\nand the less they are in our minds the better. There is no reason why we\r\nshould apply to this particular act a different method of inquiry from\r\nthat we should apply to any other of the numerous acts, of more or less\r\neconomic importance, passed in the same session of parliament. The first\r\nstep is to see whether there is a _prima facie_ case for inquiry, for\r\nmany acts of parliament have been passed which have never come into\r\noperation at all, or have been administered only for a short time on too\r\nlimited a scale to have important or lasting results. The justices were\r\nauthorized to fix wages at the Easter quarter sessions. Did they\r\nexercise their powers? To answer this question we must collect the wages\r\nassessments sanctioned by the magistrates. This is a perfectly simple\r\nand straightforward operation, involving nothing more than familiarity\r\nwith records and industry in going through them. Without having recourse\r\nto any elaborate process of economic reasoning, by confining our\r\nattention to one simple question, namely, what happened, we can\r\nestablish conclusions of the greatest interest to economic historians\r\nand, further, define the problem we have to investigate. We can show,\r\nfor example: (1) that the Statute of Apprenticeship did not stand alone;\r\nit was one of a long series of similar measures, beginning more than two\r\ncenturies before, which in their turn join on to the municipal and gild\r\nregulations of the middle ages; one of an important group of statutes,\r\nmore or less closely interwoven throughout their history, administered\r\nby local authorities whose functions had grown largely in connexion with\r\nthis legislation and the gradual differentiation of the trades and\r\ncallings to which it related. (2) That wages were regulated with much\r\ngreater frequency during the reigns of Elizabeth, James I. and Charles\r\nI. than at any later period. (3) That they were regulated in some\r\ncounties and not in others. (4) That in the counties and towns where\r\nthey were regulated the action of the magistrates was in general\r\nspasmodic, and rarely continuous for a long series of years. (5) That\r\nthe magistrates used their powers sometimes to raise wages, sometimes to\r\nforce them down. (6) That the local variations of wages and prices were\r\nwhat we should call excessive, so that the standard of comfort in one\r\ndistrict was very different from that of others. (7) That the wages\r\nassessments group themselves round certain short periods, coincident in\r\nmany instances with high prices, increase of poverty, and other causes\r\nof exceptional action. (8) That what we may call, with the above\r\nlimitations, the effective period of the act terminates with the\r\noutbreak of the Civil War. (9) That subsequent to that period organic\r\nchanges in the industries affected, coupled with the incompetence of\r\nparliament to adapt the old legislation to new conditions, and the\r\ngrowing acceptance of the doctrine of _laissez faire_, brought about a\r\ngeneral disuse of the statute, though isolated attempts to enforce it\r\nwere made and new acts applicable to certain trades were passed in the\r\n18th century. (10) For more than one hundred years before the repeal of\r\nthe act, trade unions and other forms of voluntary association amongst\r\nwage-earners, combinations amongst employers, collective agreements,\r\ncustomary regulations, were established in many of the important trades\r\nof the country. But these conclusions, after all, suggest more\r\ndifficulties than they remove, for they show that our inquiry, instead\r\nof presenting certain well-marked features which can be readily dealt\r\nwith, has to be split up into a number of highly specialized studies:\r\nthe investigation of rates of wages, prices and the standard of comfort\r\nin different localities, bye-industries, regularity of employment, the\r\norganization of particular trades, the economic functions of local\r\nauthorities, apprenticeship and a host of other subjects. Moreover, all\r\nthese subjects hang together, so that it seems impossible to come to a\r\ndecision about one of them without knowing all about the others.\r\n\r\nIt is a comparatively simple thing to state the question to which we\r\nwant an answer, but extremely difficult to define the exact nature of\r\nthe evidence which will constitute a good answer; easy enough to say we\r\nmust try hypothesis after hypothesis, and test each one by an appeal to\r\nthe facts, but a man may easily spend his life in this sort of thing and\r\nstill leave to his descendants nothing more than a legacy of rejected\r\nhypotheses. Every volume of records we look through contains a mass of\r\ndetailed information on the economic life of England in the period we\r\nare studying. How much of it is relevant to the subject of inquiry? What\r\nis to be the principle of selection? How shall we determine the relative\r\nweight and importance of different kinds of relevant evidence? As in\r\nmodern problems, so in those of past times, a man requires for success\r\nqualities quite distinct from those conferred by merely academic\r\ntraining and the use of scientific methods. A correct sense of\r\nproportion and the faculty of seizing upon the dominant factors in an\r\nhistorical problem are the result partly of the possession of certain\r\nnatural gifts in which many individuals and some nations are\r\nconspicuously wanting, partly of general knowledge of the working of the\r\neconomic and political institutions of the period we are studying,\r\npartly of what takes the place of practical experience in relation to\r\nmodern problems, namely, detailed acquaintance with different kinds of\r\noriginal sources and the historical imagination by which we can realize\r\nthe life and the ideals of past generations. These qualities are\r\nrequired all the more because, in order to make any further progress\r\nwith such an inquiry as we have suggested, we have deliberately to make\r\nuse of abstraction as an instrument of investigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The plan of a general theory.\r\n\r\nLet us see how this will work out. Suppose we have selected one of the\r\nnumerous subsidiary problems suggested by the general inquiry, and\r\nobtained such full and complete information about one particular\r\nindustry that we can tabulate the wages of the workers for a long series\r\nof years. We may do the same for other industries, some of them coming\r\nunder the Statute of Apprenticeship, others not. If all the industries\r\nbelong to one economic area over which, so far as we can tell from\r\ngeneral statistics of wages and prices, and other information, fairly\r\nhomogeneous conditions prevailed, we may be able to reach some useful\r\nconclusions as to the operation of the act. But it would be absurd to\r\nsuppose that we could reach those conclusions by simple reference to the\r\ntrades themselves. We cannot assume that the fluctuations in wages were\r\ndue to the action or inaction of magistrates without the most careful\r\nexamination of the other influences affecting the trades. In economic\r\naffairs the argument _post hoc propter hoc_ never leads to the whole\r\ntruth, and is frequently quite misleading. We cannot suppose that the\r\npolicy of the Merchant Adventurers' Company had nothing to do with the\r\nwoollen industry; that the export trade in woollen cloth was quite\r\nindependent of the foreign exchanges and international trade relations\r\nin those times; that the effect on wages of the state of the currency,\r\nthe influx of new silver, the character of the harvests, and many other\r\ninfluences can be conveniently ignored. In studying, therefore, such an\r\napparently simple question as the effect of an act of parliament on\r\nwages in a small group of trades we want a general theory which we can\r\nuse as a kind of index of the factors we have to consider.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Difficulties due to want of evidence.\r\n\r\nAssuming that we have in our minds this safeguard against loose thinking\r\nand neglect of important factors, the investigation of the special\r\nproblems arising out of the general inquiry resolves itself into a\r\ncareful definition of each problem we wish to deal with, and the\r\ncollection, tabulation and interpretation of the evidence. In most cases\r\nthe interpretation of the facts is far from obvious, and we have to try\r\nseveral hypotheses before we reach one which will bear the strain of a\r\ncritical examination in the light of further evidence. But at this stage\r\nin historical investigation it is generally the want of evidence of a\r\nsufficiently complete and continuous character, rather than difficulties\r\nof method, which forces us to leave the problem unsolved. It is, for\r\ninstance, practically impossible to obtain reliable evidence as to the\r\nregularity of employment in any industry in the 17th century, and the\r\nbest approximations and devices we can invent are very poor substitutes\r\nfor what we really want. For this reason guesswork must continue to play\r\nan important part in economic history. But every genuine attempt to\r\novercome its difficulties brings us into closer touch with the period we\r\nare examining; and though we may not be able to throw our conclusions\r\ninto the form of large generalizations, we shall get to know something\r\nof the operation of the forces which determined the economic future of\r\nEngland; understand more clearly than our forefathers did, for we have\r\nmore information than they could command, and a fuller appreciation of\r\nthe issues, the broad features of English development, and be in a\r\nposition to judge fairly well of the measures they adopted in their\r\ntime. By comparing England with other countries we may be able in the\r\ndistant future to reach conclusions of some generality as to the laws of\r\ngrowth, maturity and decay of industrial nations. But like the early\r\nstatisticians of the 17th century, economic historians are the\r\n\"beginners of an art not yet polished, which time may bring to more\r\nperfection.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  The investigation of modern questions.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to exclusively modern questions, there is no reason or\r\nnecessity for a fundamental change of method. We cannot suppose that\r\nthere occurred, at or about the commencement of the 19th century, a\r\nbreach of historical continuity of such a character that institutions,\r\ncustoms, laws and social conventions were suddenly swept away, the bonds\r\nof society loosened, and the state and people of England dissolved into\r\nan aggregate of competing individuals. The adoption of machinery\r\ngradually revolutionized the methods of production; but in the first\r\ninstance only certain industries were affected, and those not at the\r\nsame time or in the same degree; old laws grown obsolete were repealed,\r\nbut other laws affecting wage-earners and employers took their place,\r\nmore complicated and elaborate than the Elizabethan code. Trade unions,\r\nso far from disappearing, were legalized, gathered strength from the\r\nchanges in industrial organization, and nowhere became so powerful as in\r\nthe most progressive industries; while other forms of combination\r\nappeared, incomparably stronger, for good or evil, than those of earlier\r\ntimes. But while we recognize these facts, we must not suppose that we\r\nhave to study the action of men as though they were all enrolled in\r\norganized associations, or covered by stringent laws which were always\r\nobeyed. There has never been in the history of English industry such\r\nlicence as we find in certain directions in the earlier part of the 19th\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The distinctive features of modern problems.\r\n\r\nIt is not in the decay of combination and monopoly or in the growth of\r\ncompetition that we must look for the distinctive characteristics of\r\nmodern problems. A 17th-century monopoly was a very weak and ineffective\r\ninstrument compared with a modern syndicate; the Statute of\r\nApprenticeship was certainly not so widely enforced as the \"common\r\nrules\" of trade unions; and many of the regulations of past times, which\r\nlook so complicated to modern eyes, were conditions of free enterprise\r\nrather than restraints upon it. It is due to the influence of the\r\n_laisser faire_ doctrine that we regard law and regulation as a\r\nrestraint on liberty. As a maxim for guidance in public affairs,\r\n_laisser faire_ was genuinely relevant at the end of the 18th and the\r\nbeginning of the 19th century, when the Statute Book was cumbered with\r\nvexatious and obsolete laws. As an explanation of what has taken place\r\nin later years, or of the actual economic life of the present day, it is\r\nludicrously inadequate. Competition, in the sense in which the word is\r\nstill used in many economic works, is merely a special case of the\r\nstruggle for survival, and, from its limitation, does not go far towards\r\nexplaining the actual working of modern institutions. To buy in the\r\ncheapest market and sell in the dearest; to secure cheapness by lowering\r\nthe expenses of production; to adopt the less expensive rather than the\r\nmore expensive method of obtaining a given result--these and other\r\nmaxims are as old as human society. Competition, in the Darwinian sense,\r\nis characteristic not only of modern industrial states, but of all\r\nliving organisms; and in the narrower sense of the \"higgling of the\r\nmarket\" is found on the Stock Exchange, in the markets of old towns, in\r\nmedieval fairs and Oriental bazaars. In modern countries it takes\r\nmyriads of forms, from the sweating of parasitic trades to the\r\norganization of scientific research. Economic motives, again, are as\r\nvaried as the forms of competition, and their development is coeval with\r\nthat of human society. They have to be interpreted in every age in\r\nrelation to the state of society, the other motives or ideals with which\r\nthey are associated, the kind of action they inspire, and the means\r\nthrough which they operate. Apparently the same economic motives have\r\nled in the same age and in the same nation to monopoly and individual\r\nenterprise, protection and free trade, law and anarchy. In our own time\r\nthey have inspired both the formation of trade combinations and attempts\r\nto break them up, hostility to all forms of state interference and a\r\nbelief in collectivism.\r\n\r\nThe conditions which are peculiar to the modern world are the large\r\nnumbers we have to deal with, the vast and fairly homogeneous areas in\r\nwhich justice is administered and property secured, and the enormously\r\nincreased facilities for transport and communication. These conditions\r\nare of course not independent of each other, and they have brought in\r\ntheir train many consequences, some good and some bad. But they supply\r\nthe bases for that general theory which, as we have seen, is\r\nindispensable in economic investigation. From the standpoint of general\r\ntheory economic movements assume an impersonal character and economic\r\nforces operate like the forces of nature. Although economic motives have\r\nbecome more complex, they have just as much and no more to do with\r\ngeneral economic reasoning and analysis than the causes of death with\r\nthe normal expectation of life, or domestic ideals with the birth-rate.\r\nSo far as we have anything to do with psychology at all, it is the\r\npsychology of crowds and not of individuals which we have to consider.\r\nIf we study the economy of a village, the idiosyncrasies of every\r\nindividual in it are of importance. If the village is replaced by a\r\nlarge area, inhabited by millions, with modern facilities of\r\ncommunication, it is a matter of observation and experience that for the\r\npurposes of general reasoning the idiosyncrasies of individuals may be\r\nneglected. Whether such large numbers have the character of the\r\n\"economic man\" of the early economists matters very little. All the\r\nassumptions we require are furnished by observation of people in the\r\nmass and the larger generalizations of statistics. Thus we can construct\r\na kind of envelope of theory, which, by careful testing as we proceed,\r\ncan be made to indicate in a general manner the reactions of one part of\r\nthe activities of the economic world upon the others, and the\r\ninterdependence of the several parts. From its very nature this general\r\ntheory can never correspond strictly to the actual life and movement of\r\nany given state. It is useful and necessary, and plays somewhat the same\r\npart in economic investigation as ton-mile statistics do in the\r\nadministration of a railway. To express in any language or to illustrate\r\nby any images, from a purely objective standpoint, the infinitely\r\ncomplicated movements of the actual world, is a task far beyond human\r\ncapacity.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Application to modern problems.\r\n\r\nWith the aid of this general theory the methods we have sketched in\r\nrelation to historical problems apply with greater force to the special\r\nproblems of modern times, and are rewarded with results more accurate,\r\nmore fruitful, more relevant to difficulties which all civilized nations\r\nhave to face, than those of historical research. To many minds the\r\ninterest and usefulness of economics depend entirely on the application\r\nof these methods, for it is the actual working of economic institutions\r\nabout which the statesman, the publicist, the business man and the\r\nartisan wish to know. Under the conditions we have described, many of\r\nthe most interesting problems of our own time, when they are once\r\ndefined, resolve themselves into statistical inquiries. But in most\r\ncases such an inquiry cannot be successfully carried out by a mere\r\nstatistician. Definite economic problems can very rarely be dealt with\r\nby merely quantitative methods. In the tabulation and interpretation of\r\nstatistical evidence, as in its collection, it is scarcely possible to\r\noverrate the importance of wide knowledge and experience. There is\r\nanother very important instrument of investigation which can be used in\r\nour own time, but cannot be employed in historical research. Historical\r\ndocuments, however detailed, rarely show all the factors we have to deal\r\nwith or fully explain a given situation. No sane person would suppose\r\nthat the minutes of a modern legislative body explain the steps by which\r\nlegislation has been passed, or the issues really involved. The\r\nostensible cause of a modern labour dispute is frequently not the real\r\nor the most important cause. In modern problems we can watch the\r\neconomic machine actually at work, cross-examine our witnesses, see that\r\ndelicate interplay of passions and interests which cannot be set down or\r\ndescribed in a document, and acquire a certain sense of touch in\r\nrelation to the questions at issue which manuscripts and records cannot\r\nimpart. We can therefore substitute sound diagnosis for guesswork more\r\nfrequently in modern than in historical problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The \"old political economy.\"\r\n\r\nWhat then, it may be asked, becomes of the \"old Political Economy\"? Of\r\nwhat possible use are the works of the so-called classical writers,\r\nexcept in relation to the history of economics and the practical\r\ninfluence of theory in past times? If we take the mere popular view of\r\nwhat is meant by the \"old Political Economy,\" that is, that a generation\r\nor so ago economics was comprised in a neatly rounded set of general\r\npropositions, universally accepted, which could be set forth in a\r\ntext-book and learnt like the multiplication table, it is not incumbent\r\non the present generation to define its attitude at all. In this sense\r\nof the words, there was no faith delivered to our fathers which we are\r\nunder any obligation to guard or even explain. If by the \"old Political\r\nEconomy\" we mean the methods and conclusions of certain great writers,\r\nwho stood head and shoulders above their contemporaries and determined\r\nthe general character of economic science, we are still under no\r\nobligation to define the attitude of the present generation with regard\r\nto them. The fact that Adam Smith, with the meagre materials of the 18th\r\ncentury at his disposal, saw his way to important generalizations which\r\nlater research has established on a firm basis, may enhance greatly the\r\nreputation of Adam Smith, but does not strengthen the generalizations.\r\nThey stand or fall by the strength of the evidence for or against them.\r\nIn the history of economics or the biography of Ricardo it is of\r\ninterest to show that he anticipated later writers, or that his analysis\r\nbears the test of modern criticism; but no economist is under any\r\nobligation to defend Ricardo's reputation, nor is the fact that a\r\ndoctrine is included in his works to be taken as a demonstration of its\r\ntruth. The appeal to authority cannot be permitted in economics any more\r\nthan in chemistry, physics or astronomy. But the cases stated above\r\nsuggest more or less false issues. There has been no revolution in\r\neconomic science, and is not likely to be any. The question we have\r\nreally to determine is how we can make the best use of the accumulated\r\nknowledge of past generations, and to do that we must look more closely\r\ninto the economic science of the 19th century.\r\n\r\nAny one who has taken the trouble to trace the history of one of the\r\nmodern schools of economists, or of any branch of economic science,\r\nknows how difficult it is to say when it began. \"Anticipations\" of\r\nmethod and doctrine can generally be found by the diligent investigator\r\nin the economic literature of his own or a foreign country. So that\r\ncross-sections of the stream of economic thought will reveal the\r\nexistence, at different times, in varying proportions and at different\r\nstages of development, of most of the modern \"schools.\" Again, the\r\nclassification of an economic bibliography at once shows how varied has\r\nbeen the character of economic investigation, ranging from the most\r\nabstract speculation on the one hand to almost technical studies of\r\nparticular trades on the other. Of the great army of writers who\r\nflourished in the first half of the 19th century some were closely\r\nidentified with the utilitarian school, and the majority were influenced\r\nin a greater or less degree by the prevailing ideas of that school.\r\nOthers, however, were hostile to it. In many works, such as those of a\r\nstatistical or historical character, there are frequently to be found\r\npassages which could have been written in no other period, but are only\r\nof the nature of ejaculations and do not affect the argument. In stating\r\nthe position of economics during this time we cannot ignore all writers,\r\nexcept these who belonged to one group, however eminent that group may\r\nhave been, simply because they did not represent the dominant ideas of\r\nthe period, and exercised no immediate and direct influence on the\r\nmovement of economic thought. We must include the pioneers of the\r\nhistorical school, the economic historians, the socialists, the\r\nstatisticians, and others whose contributions to economics are now\r\nappreciated, and without whose labours the science as we know it now\r\nwould have been impossible. If we take this broadly historical view of\r\nthe progress of economics, it is obvious that even in England there was\r\nno general agreement, during the 19th century, as to the methods most\r\nappropriate to economic investigation.\r\n\r\nSuppose, now, we ignore the writers who were inaugurating new methods,\r\ninvestigating special problems or laboriously collecting facts, and\r\nconcentrate attention on the dominant school, with its long series of\r\nwriters from Adam Smith to John Stuart Mill. It is the work of these\r\nwriters which people have in mind when they speak of the \"old Political\r\nEconomy.\" There are several quite distinct questions we can ask with\r\nregard to them. That they must be studied closely by every one who\r\nwishes to follow the history of economics goes without saying. That they\r\nmust be studied by the economic historian is equally clear, owing to\r\ntheir practical influence and the fact that they furnished the\r\ntheoretical bases of much of the economic policy of the 19th century.\r\nThis is true whether their method is good or bad, whether their\r\nconclusions are true or false. It is not so easy to determine their\r\nrelevance and usefulness in relation to distinctively modern problems,\r\nor to indicate within what limits their work is of permanent value, and\r\nwe can only deal with these questions in their more general aspects.\r\n\r\nIt must be clear to every observer that the economists of the classical\r\nperiod, with the one exception of Adam Smith, will speedily share the\r\nfate of nearly all scientific writers. They will be forgotten, and their\r\nbooks will not be read. Adams Smith's _Wealth of Nations_, if it has\r\never been, has long ceased to be a scientific text-book. Whether a\r\nmodern economist accepts his views or not is of no importance. There is\r\nprobably not a single chapter in the _Wealth of Nations_ which would be\r\nthoroughly endorsed by any living economist. But the reputation of the\r\nbook and its author is quite independent of considerations of this kind.\r\nThe _Wealth of Nations_ is one of the great books of the world, many of\r\nthe sayings of which are likely to be more frequently quoted in the\r\nfuture than they have been in the 19th century. Malthus is already an\r\nauthor whose name is probably more widely known than that of any other\r\neconomist, but whose works are rarely read, and studied only by a small\r\nproportion of the few people who write books on the history of economic\r\ntheory. Of economic students, many are unaware of the fact that he wrote\r\nany other book than the _Essay on the Principle of Population_, and what\r\nis of permanent importance in that work is contained in the\r\ngeneralization which it suggested to Darwin. Moreover, modern\r\neconomists, while accepting in the main the general tenor of Malthus's\r\ntheory of population, would not agree with his statement of it. Like\r\nMalthus, Ricardo owes his reputation very largely to the theory\r\nassociated with his name, though it has long ceased to be stated\r\nprecisely in the terms he employed. But there are very few people in the\r\nworld who have made a careful study of his works; and although his\r\ntheory of rent has a wide and increasing application in economics, it is\r\nnot comparable in general scientific importance with Malthus's theory of\r\npopulation. It is already impossible to take J.S. Mill's _Principles of\r\nPolitical Economy_ as a text-book. Important as it was for thirty or\r\nforty years, it will soon be as little read as M'Culloch's _Principles_.\r\nFor the rest of the economists of this period, it is difficult to see\r\nhow they can escape oblivion. When the generation whose economic\r\ntraining was based upon J.S. Mill has died out, the relevance of the\r\n\"old Political Economy\" is not likely to be a question of any interest\r\nto ordinary educated men and women, or even to the great mass of\r\neconomic students.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of this decay of interest does not lie upon the surface.\r\nIt is frequently supposed that the influence of the \"old Political\r\nEconomy\" has been gradually undermined by the attacks of the historical\r\nschool. But great as the achievements of this school have been, it has\r\nnot developed any scientific machinery which can take the place of\r\ntheory in economic investigation. If our view is correct that, broadly\r\nspeaking, the two ways of regarding economic questions are complementary\r\nrather than mutually exclusive, there does not seem to be any reason why\r\nthe growth of the historical school should have been destructive of the\r\n\"old Political Economy\" if it had been well founded. The use of the\r\nhistorical method has, in fact, raised more reputations than it has\r\ndestroyed, because by keeping carefully in view the conditions in which\r\neconomic works have been written, it has shown that many theories\r\nhastily condemned as unsound by _a priori_ critics had much to be said\r\nfor them at the time when they were propounded. This observation is true\r\nnot only of old-world writers like the Mercantilists, but also of\r\nRicardian economics. No one is concerned to prove that the Ricardian\r\neconomics applies to the manorial system, and it is generally supposed\r\nat any rate that the world has been approximating more and more nearly\r\nduring the last century to the conditions assumed in most of the\r\nreasoning of that school. On the principles we have explained,\r\ntherefore, the Ricardian economics should supply just that body of\r\ngeneral theory which is required in the investigation of modern economic\r\nproblems, and the reputation of at any rate the leading writers should\r\nbe as great as ever. It would be of immense advantage from a scientific\r\npoint of view if this could be taken for granted, if for a time the work\r\nof the classical economists could be considered final so far as it goes,\r\nand for the purposes of investigation regarded as the theoretical\r\ncounterpart of the modern industrial system. This assumption, however,\r\nhas been made quite impossible, not by the historical school, but by the\r\ncriticism and analysis of economists in the direct line of the Ricardian\r\nsuccession.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ricardo's limitations.\r\n\r\nModern economic criticism and analysis has destroyed the authority of\r\nthe \"old Political Economy\" as a scientific system. The assumptions, the\r\ndefinitions, the reasoning, the conclusions of the classical writers\r\nhave been ruthlessly overhauled. Defects in their arguments have been\r\nexposed to view by those who are most concerned to defend their\r\nreputation. Writers with none of the prejudices of the historical\r\nschool, but with the cold and remorseless regard for logic of the purely\r\nobjective critic, have pointed out serious inconsistencies here, the\r\nomission of important factors there, until very little of the \"old\r\nPolitical Economy\" is left unscathed. In fact, there never was a\r\nscientific system at all. What was mistaken for it was fashioned in the\r\nheat of controversy by men whose interests were practical rather than\r\nscientific, who could not write correct English, and revealed in their\r\nreasoning the usual fallacies of the merely practical man. So the \"old\r\nPolitical Economy\" lies shattered. It is useless to suppose that this\r\ndestructive criticism from within can be neutralized by generously\r\nsprinkling the pages of the classical writers with interpretation\r\nclauses. This may serve to show that the ideals of our youth were not\r\nwithout justification; but the younger generation, which does not care\r\nabout our ideals, and looks to the future rather than the past, will not\r\nread annotated editions of old books, however eminent their authors. If\r\nthe Ricardian school of economists had been merely philosophers, or even\r\na group like the French physiocrats, this state of things might be\r\nregarded with equanimity. We might assume that criticism and analysis\r\nhad separated the wheat from the chaff in their writings, that\r\neverything of permanent value had probably been preserved and\r\nincorporated in the works of later economists. But the character of much\r\nof their work makes this assumption impossible. It is, in fact, quite\r\ntrue that many of them were more interested in practical aims than in\r\nthe advancement of economic science. We may talk of the assumptions\r\nimplicitly involved in Ricardo's works. In reality we do not know what\r\nthose assumptions were; we only know what assumptions we should make in\r\norder to reach the same conclusions, and they may be very different from\r\n\"the mind of Ricardo.\" Ricardo's works, in fact, do not explain a\r\ntheoretical system, but contain the matured reflections, more or less\r\nclosely reasoned, of a man of great mental power looking out on the\r\nworld as it appeared to a business man experienced in affairs. The\r\nconclusions of such a work are of wider significance than the\r\nassumptions we attribute to the author would warrant. They are not\r\nexpressed in terms which satisfy our canons of scientific accuracy.\r\nDissected sentence by sentence, the book may be shown to be a mass of\r\ninconsistencies. If it has the misfortune to be systematized by an\r\nenthusiastic but dull and incompetent disciple, it may appear even\r\nabsurd. But after all the misinterpretation of contemporaries and the\r\ndestructive criticism of later times, the book as a whole leaves upon us\r\nan impression of peculiar strength and charm, and imparts a sense of the\r\nrelations of things truer, because less mechanical, than the laboured\r\nreasoning of smaller men. Such is the character of much of the work of\r\nRicardo and some of his contemporaries. We think that the decay of\r\ninterest in these writers involves a real loss, and that students of\r\nmodern problems may do worse than read Ricardo and his school. Some of\r\nthe criticism of their works, necessary and useful as it has been, will\r\nprobably be corrected later on by that breadth of view and sense of\r\nproportion which has enabled us to appreciate justly the achievements of\r\nlesser men in more remote times. But rehabilitation in accordance with\r\nthe canons of historical justice will not restore the lost influence of\r\nthe Ricardian school. Their achievements in the 19th century will be\r\nfully acknowledged, but the relevance of their work to the problems of\r\nthe 20th century will be admitted less than at the present time.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Economics a conservative science.\r\n\r\nIn a subject like economics it must always be very difficult to decide\r\nhow far a departure from the traditional form and expression of its main\r\ndoctrines is necessary or desirable. No one who is really experienced in\r\neconomic investigation cares to emphasize the originality, still less\r\nthe revolutionary character of his own work. It is much more likely than\r\nnot that some principle which for the moment seems new, some distinction\r\nwhich we may flatter ourselves has not been observed before, has been\r\npointed out over and over again by previous writers, although, owing to\r\nspecial circumstances, it may not have received the notice it deserved.\r\nEconomics is therefore, on the whole, an intensely conservative science,\r\nin which new truths are cautiously admitted or incorporated merely as\r\nextensions or qualifications of those enunciated by previous writers.\r\nThis procedure has its advantages, but it may easily become dangerous by\r\ndestroying the influence of the science it is meant to preserve. It is\r\nnot unlike the procedure of the canonists and casuists of the middle\r\nages with regard to the doctrine of usury, by which the doctrine was to\r\nall appearances preserved intact while in reality it was stripped of all\r\nits original meaning by innumerable distinctions \"over-curious and\r\nprecise.\" In the same way the doctrines of the classical economists may\r\nbe adapted by interpretation clauses and qualifications the exact force\r\nof which cannot be tested or explained, so that we do not know whether\r\nthe original proposition is to be considered substantially correct or\r\nnot. The result will be that while the doctrines are apparently being\r\nbrought into closer correspondence with the facts of life, they will in\r\nreality be made quite useless for practical purposes or economic\r\ninvestigation. It is easier to point out the danger than to suggest how\r\nit should be met. The position we have described is no doubt partly due\r\nto the unsettlement of economic opinion and the hostile criticism of\r\nold-established doctrines which has characterized the last generation.\r\nOr it may be the result of economic agnosticism, combined with\r\nunwillingness to cut adrift from old moorings. Whatever the cause, the\r\ncomplete restatement of economic theory, which some heroic persons\r\ndemand, is clearly impossible, except on conditions not likely to be\r\nrealized in the immediate future. The span of life is limited; the work\r\nrequires an extensive knowledge of the economic literature of several\r\ncountries and the general features of all the important departments of\r\nmodern economic activity. In general theory special studies by other men\r\ncannot play the same part as they do in historical and statistical work.\r\nIn historical and statistical investigation, or in special studies of\r\nparticular subjects, it is possible, given the pecuniary means, to\r\norganize a whole army of skilled assistants, and with ordinary care to\r\ncombine the results of their separate efforts. In general theory the\r\ninverse rule seems to prevail. There the unity of conception and aim,\r\nthe firm grip of all the different lines of argument and their relation\r\nto each other, which are required, can only be given by a single brain.\r\nBut no one individual can do original work over the whole field. He is\r\nlucky if he can throw new light on a few old propositions. For the rest,\r\nhe can only, with the utmost caution, adopt the suggestions of other\r\nminds as qualifications of old doctrines, never feeling quite sure that\r\nhe is right in doing so. A complete restatement could only be undertaken\r\nby a group of men, trained in much the same conditions, accustomed to\r\nthink and work together, each one engaged on a special department, but\r\nall acting under the control of one master-mind. This is largely a\r\nquestion of the organization of economic studies, and it is of the\r\ngreatest importance that, if possible, such an effort should be made to\r\npresent in a connected form the best results of modern criticism and\r\nanalysis.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Some recent developments of economic theory.\r\n\r\nEconomics is unlike many other sciences in the fact that its claim to\r\nrecognition must be based upon its practical utility, on its relevance\r\nto the actual life of the economic world, on its ability to unravel the\r\nsocial and economic difficulties of each generation, and to contribute\r\nto the progress of nations. The very effectiveness of modern criticism\r\nand analysis, which has brought great gains in almost all branches of\r\neconomic theory, has made the science more difficult as a subject of\r\nordinary study. The extensions, the changes or the qualifications, of\r\nold doctrines, which at any rate in the works of responsible writers are\r\nrarely made without good if not always sufficient reason, have modified\r\nvery considerably the whole science, and weakened the confidence of\r\nordinary educated men in its conclusions. In the case of many subjects\r\nthis would matter very little, but in that of economics, which touches\r\nthe ordinary life of the community at so many points, it is of great\r\nimportance, especially at a time like the present, when economic\r\nquestions determine the policy of great nations. The \"economic man\" of\r\nthe earlier writers, with his aversion from labour and his desire of the\r\npresent enjoyment of costly indulgences, has been abandoned by their\r\nsuccessors, with the result that in the opinion of many good people\r\naltruistic sentiment may be allowed to run wild over the whole domain of\r\neconomics. The \"economic man\" has, on the other hand, been succeeded by\r\nanother creation almost as monstrous, if his lineaments are to be\r\nsupposed to be those of the ordinary individual--a man, that is, who\r\nregulates his life in accordance with Gossen's Law of Satiety, and whose\r\nmain passion is to discover a money measure of his motives. It is\r\nextremely important to consider how far the economic conceptions based\r\nupon this view of the action of men in the ordinary business of\r\nlife--such, for example, as the doctrine of marginal utility--depend for\r\ntheir truth and relevance on the fact that in economics we are dealing\r\nwith large aggregates. The earlier writers generally assumed perfect\r\nmobility of labour and capital. No economist would deliberately make\r\nthat assumption now unless he were dealing with some purely theoretical\r\nproblem, for the solution of which it was legitimate at some stage in\r\nthe reasoning. Many of the questions of the greatest practical\r\nimportance at the present time, such as the competition between old and\r\nnew methods of manufacturing commodities substantially the same in kind,\r\nand equally useful to the great body of consumers, arise largely from\r\nthe immobility of capital or labour, or both of them. But it is obvious\r\nthat if the assumption of perfect mobility is invalid, there is scarcely\r\nany economic doctrine identified with the earlier writers which may not\r\nrequire modification, in what degree it is impossible to say without\r\nvery careful investigation. Much suggestive work on this subject of a\r\ngeneral character is incorporated in economic books of the present day,\r\nbut there is room for a whole series of careful monographs on a question\r\nof such fundamental importance. The same may be said of another subject,\r\ntoo frequently neglected by earlier writers, to which due significance\r\nhas been given in the best recent work, namely, time in relation to\r\nvalue. It would perhaps be too much to say that the full consideration\r\nof this point has revolutionized the theory of value, but it has\r\ncertainly created what seems almost a new science in close contact with\r\nthe actual life of the modern world.\r\n\r\nSome doctrines of the earlier economists, such as the Wages Fund Theory,\r\nare now practically abandoned, though it may be said that they contained\r\na certain amount of truth. Others, which were considered of fundamental\r\nimportance, owe their position in modern economics and the form in which\r\nthey are stated to the \"tradition of the elders.\" If they could, by some\r\nhappy chance, have been left for discovery by modern economists, they\r\nwould without doubt have received different treatment, to the great\r\nadvantage of economic science. Such a doctrine is the so-called Law of\r\nDiminishing Returns, which Mill considered \"the most important\r\nproposition in Political Economy.\" \"Unless this one matter,\" he says,\r\n\"be thoroughly understood, it is to no purpose proceeding any further in\r\nour inquiry.\" \"Were the law different, nearly all the phenomena of the\r\nproduction and distribution of wealth would be other than they are.\" On\r\nthe other hand, Thorold Rogers, not to speak of earlier objectors,\r\ndescribed the law as a \"dismal and absurd theorem.\" The opinions of\r\npresent-day economists appear to fluctuate between these two extremes.\r\nThe law may apparently be \"a general rule\" or \"a tendency\" which is\r\nliable to be \"checked,\" or a particular case of the law of the\r\nconservation of energy. If we go to Mill to discover what it is, we find\r\nthat \"it is not pretended that the law of diminishing return was\r\noperative from the beginning of society; and though some political\r\neconomists may have believed it to come into operation earlier than it\r\ndoes, it begins quite early enough to support the conclusions they\r\nfounded on it.\" \"It comes into operation at a certain and not very\r\nadvanced stage in the progress of agriculture.\" But this very important\r\nstage in the history of a nation is not defined or clearly illustrated.\r\nWe are told that we can see \"the law at work underneath the more\r\nsuperficial agencies on which attention fixes itself\"; it \"undergoes\r\ntemporary suspension,\" which may last indefinitely; and \"there is\r\nanother agency, in habitual antagonism\" to it, namely, \"the progress of\r\ncivilization,\" which may include every kind of human improvement. Mill\r\napparently is not content with the confusion between \"law\" and \"agency\"\r\nor \"force,\" but opposes the one to the other. He is constantly speaking\r\nin terms which imply the conquering of one law by another, a habit from\r\nwhich his successors have not freed themselves; and the theory of\r\nnatural processes which appears to have satisfied him, was that when two\r\nforces come into operation there is a partial or complete suspension of\r\none by the other. In modern economics \"fertility\" has no very definite\r\nmeaning. It may mean what is ordinarily understood by the word--climate,\r\nrainfall, railway rates or anything else except \"indestructible powers\r\nof the soil.\" To speak of \"additional labour and capital\" without\r\nreference to the kind and quality of the labour and capital, and the\r\nmanner in which they are employed, organized and directed, throws very\r\nlittle light on agriculture. Every improvement involves, from a\r\nquantitative point of view, more or less of capital or of labour, so\r\nthat it is the \"antagonizing\" influences, which are nearly all\r\nqualitative, which appear to be really important. It is therefore\r\nextraordinarily difficult at present to know what happens, or rather\r\nwhat would happen if it were not prevented, when a country reaches \"the\r\nstage of diminishing returns\"; what precisely it is which comes into\r\noperation, for obviously the diminishing returns are the results, not\r\nthe cause; or how commodities \"obey\" a law which is always \"suspended.\"\r\nPossibly the present generation of English industrial history will\r\nfurnish many illustrations of the law of diminishing returns. We can\r\nonly say that it requires investigation and restatement.\r\n\r\nClosely related to the law of diminishing returns is the Theory of Rent.\r\nNo economic doctrine so well illustrates the achievements and the\r\ndefects of modern economic analysis. Ricardo's statement of the theory\r\nleft upon the world an impression, not wholly just, of singular\r\nclearness. He employed the theory with wonderful success in unravelling\r\nthe problems of his time. Its importance has not been seriously, or at\r\nany rate successfully, called in question. Treated at first as a\r\ndoctrine peculiarly applicable to land, with a certain controverted\r\nrelevance to other natural agents, it has been so extended that there is\r\nscarcely any subject of economic study in which we may not expect to\r\nfind adaptations or analogies, so that Ricardo seemed to have discovered\r\nthe key of economic knowledge. But it was discovered that there were no\r\n\"indestructible powers of the soil\"; that the fertility of land in a\r\ncountry like England is almost entirely the result of improvement at\r\nsome time or other; that \"advantage of situation\" includes very much\r\nmore than the words in their literal sense imply; that both \"fertility\"\r\nand \"advantage of situation\" include many kinds of differential\r\nadvantage; that in some circumstances rent does not enter into the price\r\nof agricultural and other produce, and that in others it does. Moreover,\r\nthe study of the theory of rent has had a very great influence on all\r\nbranches of economics by destroying the notion that it is possible to\r\ndraw sharp lines of distinction, or deal with economic conceptions as\r\nthough they were entirely independent categories. That modern economic\r\nanalysis is incomparably more accurate than that of earlier times there\r\ncan be no question. But the net result of the development of the\r\ndoctrine of rent is that all problems in which this factor appears, and\r\nthey embrace the whole range of economic theory, must apparently be\r\ntreated on their merits. In its modern form the doctrine is far too\r\ngeneral to be serviceable without the closest scrutiny of all the facts\r\nrelating to the particular case to which it is applied. To deal\r\nadequately with the numerous extensions or qualifications of these and\r\nother doctrines in the hands of modern economists would involve us in an\r\nattempt to do what we have already said is impossible except on\r\nconditions not at present realized. It is clear that in the interests of\r\ngeneral economic theory we require a vast number of special studies\r\nbefore an adequate restatement can be undertaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Relations between general economics and special studies.\r\n\r\nIt must be clearly recognized that the functions of economic science in\r\nthe present requirements of the world cannot possibly; be discharged by\r\ntreatises on economic theory. The relations between general theory and\r\nspecial studies conducted on the lines we have indicated have completely\r\nchanged. General theory never has been, and in the nature of things\r\nnever can be, the actual reflex of the life and movement of the economic\r\nworld. It never has been, and never can be, more than an indication of\r\nthe kind of thing which might be expected in a purely hypothetical\r\nworld. When the aim of the man of affairs and the hypothesis of the\r\neconomist was unrestricted competition, and measures were being adopted\r\nto realize it, general theory such as the classical economists provided\r\nwas perhaps a sufficiently trustworthy guide for practical statesmen and\r\nmen of business. If only people can be got to believe in them, a few\r\nabstract principles are quite enough to destroy an institution which it\r\nhas taken centuries to create. But a new institution cannot be made on\r\nthe same terms. The modern industrial system has brought with it an\r\nimmense variety of practical problems which nations must solve on pain\r\nof industrial and commercial ruin. For these problems we want, not a few\r\nold-established general principles which no one seriously calls in\r\nquestion, but genuine constructive and organizing capacity, aided by\r\nscientific and detailed knowledge of particular institutions, industries\r\nand classes. Just as the historical school grew up along with the\r\ngreatest constructive achievement of the 19th century, namely, the\r\nconsolidation of Germany, so the application to modern problems of the\r\nmethods of that school has been called forth by the constructive needs\r\nof the present generation. We have already shown how these methods, in\r\ntheir turn, require the aid of general theory, but not of a general\r\ntheory which tries to do their work. In fact, every attempt to make it\r\ndo so must inevitably fail. How can such a huge mass of general\r\npropositions as are necessarily included in a system of economics ever\r\nbe thoroughly tested by an appeal to facts? If they are not so tested,\r\nthe general theory will remain a general theory, of no practical use in\r\nitself, until the end of time. It they are to be tested, an indefinitely\r\nlarge number of special studies must be made, for which the original\r\nmaterials must be collected and examined. That is, original\r\ninvestigation of special problems has to be carried out on a more\r\ngigantic scale than any economist of the historical school ever dreamt\r\nof or the world requires, with the certain knowledge that at the end of\r\nit all the general theory will not correspond with the facts of life.\r\nFor there is all the difference in the world between using a body of\r\ngeneral theory as an indication of the factors to be considered in the\r\nstudy of a special problem, and undertaking special studies with a view\r\nto testing the general theory. If the necessary limitations of general\r\neconomic theory are recognized, most of the difficulties we have noticed\r\ndisappear. Now that the \"industrial revolution\" has extended practically\r\nall over the world, so that we have several countries carrying on\r\nproduction by modern methods, it is easily possible to sketch the main\r\nfeatures of industrial and commercial organization at the present time,\r\nto describe the banking and currency systems of the principal nations,\r\ntheir means of transport and communication, their systems of commercial\r\nlaw and finance, and their commercial policy. It is true that at present\r\nvery little work of this kind has been done in England, but innumerable\r\nbooks, many of them about England, have been written by thoroughly\r\ncompetent economists, in French, German and other languages. So that no\r\ngreat amount of original work is required for a reliable account of\r\nthose general features of the modern system which should form the\r\nintroduction to economics. The general theory which we require should be\r\nsketched in firm and clear outline, leaving the detailed qualifications\r\nof broad principles to special studies, where they can be dealt with if\r\nit is necessary or desirable, and examined by statistical and other\r\ntests. For such a general theory there is ample material in the economic\r\nliterature of all civilized countries. It is of the utmost importance\r\nthat the economic terms, which are also, though in many cases with an\r\nentirely different meaning, the terms of business and commerce, should\r\nas far as possible be used in their common and ordinary English sense:\r\nthat they should correspond in meaning with the same words when used in\r\ndescription, in law, accountancy and ordinary business. This is no doubt\r\na difficult matter. But some change in this direction is necessary both\r\nin the interests of the science itself and of its practical utility. All\r\nthe materials for investigation, all the facts and figures from which\r\nillustrations are drawn, all methods of keeping accounts in England,\r\nassume the ordinary English tongue. There are few if any conceptions in\r\neconomics which cannot be expressed in it without depleting the ordinary\r\nvocabulary. At present the language of economics is for the ordinary\r\nEnglishman like a foreign language of exceptional difficulty, because\r\nhe is constantly meeting with words which suggest to his mind a whole\r\nworld of associations quite different from those with which economic\r\ntheory has clothed them. The refinements of economic analysis, as\r\ndistinguished from its broader achievements, should be reserved for\r\nspecial studies, in which a technical scientific terminology, specially\r\ndevised, can be used without danger of misconception. But in a subject\r\nlike economics obscurity and an awkward terminology are not marks of\r\nscientific merit.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Economic problems in Great Britain.\r\n\r\nEconomic studies should be as relevant to existing needs as those of\r\nengineering and other applied sciences. The scientific study of\r\npractical problems and difficulties is (generally speaking, and with\r\nhonourable exceptions) far more advanced in almost every civilized\r\ncountry than it is in England, where the limited scale upon which such\r\nwork is carried on, the indifference of statesmen, officials and\r\nbusiness men, and the incapacity of the public to understand the close\r\nrelation between scientific study and practical success, contrast very\r\nunfavourably with the state of affairs in Germany or the United States.\r\nThe backwardness of economic science has been an index of the danger\r\nthreatening the industrial and commercial supremacy of the United\r\nKingdom. There are very few questions of public or commercial importance\r\nupon which the best and most recent investigations are to be found\r\namongst English works. This would matter very little, perhaps, if\r\nEnglishmen had a firm belief, established by actual experience, in the\r\nsoundness of their policy, the present security of their position, and\r\nthe sufficiency of their methods to strengthen or maintain it. But this\r\nis very far from being the case. If we take, for example, the\r\ncorner-stone of the British commercial system in the 19th century,\r\nnamely, the policy of \"free trade\" (q.v.), the public do not now read\r\nthe economic works which supplied the theoretical basis of that policy,\r\nand, indeed, would not be convinced by them. The great men of the\r\nperiod, Cobden and Bright, are merely historical figures. Long before\r\nhis death, Bright's references in public speeches to the achievements of\r\nthe Anti-Corn Law League were received with respectful impatience, and\r\nPeel's famous speech on the repeal of the corn laws would not convince\r\nthe German Reichstag or a modern House of Commons. The result is that\r\nfree trade had become by the end of the 19th century in the main an old\r\nhabit, for which the ordinary English manufacturer could give no very\r\nreasonable explanation, whatever may be its influence in commerce and\r\npublic affairs. The doctrine of free trade only prevailed in so far as\r\nit could be restated in terms which had a direct relevance to the\r\nexisting position of England and existing conditions of international\r\ntrade. And it was directly challenged by the representatives of Mr\r\nChamberlain's school of Imperialist thought (see CHAMBERLAIN, JOSEPH).\r\nIt thus became the work of economic science ruthlessly to analyse the\r\nexisting situation, explain the issues involved in the commercial policy\r\nof different countries, and point out the alternative methods of dealing\r\nwith present difficulties, with their probable results.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Commerce and finance.\r\n\r\nThe commercial policy of a state is merely the reflex of its system of\r\npublic finance (see e.g. ENGLISH FINANCE). The absence of conviction in\r\nregard to British commercial policy naturally had its counterpart in the\r\nattitude of many men to the financial system of the country. The\r\neulogies showered upon it in the past were no longer considered\r\nadequate. The great increase in recent years in British military and\r\nnaval expenditure, made necessary by the exceptional demands of a state\r\nof war and the great development of foreign powers, was partly\r\nresponsible for the new difficulties; partly it was due to the great\r\nextension of the functions of the state during the latter part of the\r\n19th century. The former causes may be considered partly permanent,\r\npartly temporary; but those of a permanent character are likely to\r\nincrease in force, and those of a temporary character will leave a\r\ndeposit in the shape of an addition to the normal expenditure of the\r\ncentral government. The extension of government functions appeared much\r\nmore likely to continue than to be checked. Normal expenditure might\r\ntherefore be calculated to rise rather than fall. In spite of the vast\r\nincrease in national wealth, it was found a matter of increasing\r\ndifficulty to meet a comparatively slight strain without recourse to\r\nmeasures of a highly controversial character; and the search for new\r\nsources of revenue (as in 1909) at once raised, in an acute form,\r\nquestions of national commercial policy and the relations between the\r\nUnited Kingdom and the colonies.\r\n\r\nThe development of the powers of the central government has been less\r\nthan that of the functions of local governing authorities. This, again,\r\nis a movement much more likely to extend than to be checked. Local\r\ngoverning authorities now discharge economic functions of enormous\r\nimportance and complexity, involving sums of money larger than sufficed\r\nto run important states a generation ago. The scientific study of the\r\neconomics of local administration is, however, in its infancy, and\r\nrequires to be taken up in earnest by economists. These questions of\r\ncommercial policy and local government are closely bound up with the\r\nscientific study of the transport system. Although the British Empire\r\ncontains within itself every known species of railway enterprise, the\r\nstudy of railways and other means of transport, and their relation to\r\nthe business, the commerce and the social life of the country, is\r\ndeplorably backward. It is obvious that no inquiry into commercial\r\npolicy, or into such social questions as the housing of the poor, can be\r\neffective unless this deficiency is remedied.\r\n\r\nThe whole social and political fabric of the British Empire depends upon\r\nthe efficiency of its industrial system. On this subject many monographs\r\nand larger works have been published in recent years, but dealing rather\r\nwith such questions as trade unionism, co-operation and factory\r\nlegislation, than the structure and organization of particular\r\nindustries, or the causes and the results of the formation of the great\r\ncombinations, peculiarly characteristic of the United States, but not\r\nwanting in England, which are amongst the most striking economic\r\nphenomena of modern times.\r\n\r\nThese are some of the questions which must absorb the energies of the\r\nrising generation of economists. The claim of economics for recognition\r\nas a science and as a subject of study must be based on its relevance to\r\nthe actual life of the economic world, on its ability to unravel the\r\npractical difficulties of each generation, and so contribute to the\r\nprogress of nations.\r\n\r\n  LITERATURE.--See also FREE TRADE; PROTECTION; TARIFF; COMMERCIAL\r\n  TREATIES; TRUSTS; MONEY; FINANCE; &c. The bibliography of economics as\r\n  a whole would include a history of all the writers on the subject, and\r\n  is beyond our scope here; see the numerous articles on economic\r\n  subjects throughout this work. The article by Dr J.K. Ingram in the\r\n  ninth edition of the _Encyclopaedia Britannica_ is still a valuable\r\n  historical account. It is only possible to mention here a few of the\r\n  more recent text-books. The most important general work published in\r\n  English is Marshall's _Principles of Economics_, vol. i. (1st edition,\r\n  1890; 4th edition, 1898). J. Shield Nicholson's _Principles of\r\n  Political Economy_ (3 vols.) not only gives a survey of economic\r\n  principles since Mill's time, but contains much suggestive and\r\n  original work. The writer of this article is much indebted to the\r\n  works of Schmoller, particularly his _Grundris der allgemeinen\r\n  Volkswirtschaftslehre_ (1900), and Adolph Wagner, particularly his\r\n  _Grundlegung der politischen Okonomie_. On the history of economic\r\n  theory, Cannan's _History of the Theories of Production and\r\n  Distribution_ (1776-1848) is an admirable criticism, from a purely\r\n  objective standpoint, of the works of the English classical writers.\r\n  The most important English works published in recent years on general\r\n  English economic history are W. Cunningham's _Growth of Industry and\r\n  Commerce_, and W.J. Ashley's _Economic History_, while Vinogradoff's\r\n  _Villenage in England_ and _The Growth of the Manor_, as well as\r\n  Maitland's _Domesday Studies_, are of great importance to the student\r\n  of early economic institutions. D'Avenel's _Histoire economique de la\r\n  propriete, &c._ (_1200-1800_), is a monumental work on the history of\r\n  prices in France. Other books dealing with special subjects are likely\r\n  to take a very high place in economic literature. We may mention\r\n  particularly Charles Booth's _Life and Labour of the People in\r\n  London_, B.S. Rowntree's _Poverty_, Sidney and Beatrice Webb's\r\n  _History of Trade Unionism_ and _Industrial Democracy_, and Dr Arthur\r\n  Shadwell's _Industrial Efficiency_ (1906). These books are generally\r\n  regarded as typical of the best English work of recent years in\r\n  economic investigation. We may also mention Schloss's _Methods of\r\n  Industrial Remuneration_, a most important contribution to the study\r\n  of the wages question; C.F. Bastable's works on _International Trade_\r\n  and _Public Finance_; George Clare on the _Money Market_ and the\r\n  _Foreign Exchanges_; and A.T. Hadley's _Economics: An Account of the\r\n  Relations between Private Property and Public Welfare_ (1896). Studies\r\n  of particular questions, both concrete and theoretical, in foreign\r\n  languages are too numerous to specify, and much of the best modern\r\n  work is to be found in economic periodicals.     (W. A. S. H.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMY, a township and a village of Beaver county, Pennsylvania,\r\nU.S.A., on the E. bank of the Ohio river, 17 m. N.W. of Pittsburg. Pop.\r\nof township (1900) 1062; (1910) 860. The village is served by the\r\nPennsylvania system. It was owned until 1904, when it was sold to a land\r\ncompany, by the Harmony Society (see COMMUNISM), commonly called the\r\nEconomites, Harmonists or Rappists. The founder, George Rapp, after\r\nliving with his would-be primitive Christian followers at Harmony,\r\nButler county, Pennsylvania, in 1803-1814, and in 1815-1824 in New\r\nHarmony (q.v.), Indiana, which he then sold to Robert Owen, settled here\r\nin 1824 and rapidly built up a village, in which each family received a\r\nhouse and garden. The culture of silk, flax, grapes (for wine-making)\r\nand fruits and cereals in general, and the manufacture of flour and of\r\nwoollen, flannel and cotton fabrics, were carried on under a rule\r\nrequiring every adult to labour 12 or 14 hours each day in field or\r\nmill. Celibacy had been adopted in 1807 as the rule of the community.\r\nNew members were received after a half-year's probation, and members who\r\nleft received their original investment. Three hundred thus separated\r\nfrom Rapp in 1833, with $105,000 as their share of the communal\r\nproperty, to build the millennial kingdom of New Jerusalem at\r\nPhillipsburg (now Monaca), Beaver county, Pennsylvania, under the lead\r\nof Bernhard Muller, who had come to Economy in 1831 as a fellow\r\nreligionist, and was called Count Maximilian de Leon (or Proli); in 1833\r\nLeon went, with his followers, to Louisiana, and established a religious\r\ncolony 6 m. from Natchitoches. After his death his wife until 1871 was\r\nhead of a similar community at Germantown in Webster parish. The\r\nHarmonists at Economy flourished under the rule of a tradesman, R.L.\r\nBaker, or Romelius Langenbacher, after the death of Rapp in 1847, and\r\nduring the Civil War had about $500,000 buried away. Their numbers were\r\nfor a time kept up by the addition of fresh converts, but the employes\r\nwho were not Harmonists soon greatly outnumbered the members of the\r\ncommunity, the basis of which was always religious. Baker died in 1868,\r\nand his successor, John Henrici, in 1892, when John S. Duss became first\r\ntrustee. In 1907 there were only two or three members in the society. In\r\n1851 the township of Harmony was set apart from Economy.\r\n\r\n  See Morris Hillquit, _History of Socialism in the United States_ (New\r\n  York, 1903); William A. Hinds, _American Communities_ (revised\r\n  edition, Chicago, 1902); John L. Bole, _The Harmony Society_\r\n  (Philadelphia, 1904); Charles Nordhoff, _The Communistic Societies of\r\n  the United States_ (New York, 1875); and among several excellent\r\n  monographs in German, Karl Knortz, _Die christlichkommunistische\r\n  Kolonie der Rappisten_ (Leipzig, 1892), and J. Hanno Deiler, _Eine\r\n  vergessene deutsche Colonie: eine Stimme zur Verteidigung des Grafen\r\n  de Leon_ (New Orleans, 1900).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMY, a word ranging in application from the careful thrift of an\r\nindividual to the systematic arrangement of an organization. It is\r\nderived from the Gr. [Greek: oikonomia], the management ([Greek:\r\nnemein], to control) of an [Greek: oikos] or house, extended in meaning\r\nto the administration of a state. Of its original sense, the art or\r\nscience of managing a household, the expression \"domestic economy\"\r\nsurvives, but the principal use in this sense is confined to the thrifty\r\nmanagement of the financial resources of a household or of an\r\nindividual. It is thus used as equivalent to \"saving,\" not only of\r\nmoney, but of time, labour or effort, and, generally, of the least\r\nexpenditure of means to attain a required end. It is on the principle of\r\n\"economy\" that many phonetic changes occur in the development of\r\nlanguages, and, in aesthetics, the name has been applied to a principle\r\nor law that effects are pleasant in proportion to the smallness of the\r\neffort made, and of the means taken to produce the result. The phrase\r\n\"economy of truth\" is due to an invidious application of the use, in\r\npatristic theology, of the word [Greek: oikonomia] for the careful\r\npresentation of such doctrine as would be applicable to the hearer (see\r\nJ.H. Newman, _History of the Arians of the 4th Century_). \"Economy\" is\r\nalso used in theology in such expressions as \"Mosaic\" or \"Christian\r\neconomy\" as a synonym of \"dispensation,\" for the administration of the\r\nworld by God at particular times or for particular races. From the\r\nmeaning of organization or administration of a house or state the word\r\nis applied more widely to the ordered arrangement of any organized body,\r\nand is equivalent almost to \"system\"; thus the \"economy\" of nature or of\r\nanimal or plant life may be spoken of. The most common use, however, of\r\nthe word is that of \"political economy,\" the science dealing with the\r\nproduction, distribution and consumption of wealth (see ECONOMICS).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nECSTASY (Gr. [Greek: ekstasis], from [Greek: existemi], put out of its\r\nplace, alter), a term applied to a morbid mental condition, in which the\r\nmind is entirely absorbed in the contemplation of one dominant idea or\r\nobject, and loses for the time its normal self-control. With this there\r\nis commonly associated the prevalence of some strong emotion, which\r\nmanifests itself in various ways, and with varying degrees of intensity.\r\nThis state resembles in many points that of catalepsy (q.v.), but\r\ndiffers from it sufficiently to constitute it a separate affection. The\r\npatient in ecstasy may lie in a fixed position like the cataleptic,\r\napparently quite unconscious, yet, on awaking, there is a distinct\r\nrecollection of visions perceived during this period. More frequently\r\nthere is violent emotional excitement which may find expression in\r\nimpassioned utterances, and in extravagant bodily movements and\r\ngesticulations. Ecstasy usually presents itself as a kind of temporary\r\nreligious insanity, and has frequently appeared as an epidemic. It is\r\nwell illustrated in the celebrated examples of the dancing epidemics of\r\nGermany and Italy in the middle ages, and the _Convulsionnaires_ of St\r\nMedard at the grave of the Abbe Paris in the early part of the 18th\r\ncentury, and in more recent times has been witnessed during periods of\r\nreligious revivalism. (See also INSANITY and NEUROPATHOLOGY.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nECTOSPORA, a homogeneous and natural division of Protozoan parasites\r\nincluded under the Sporozoa; they comprise the three orders, Gregarines,\r\nCoccidia and Haemosporidia. The defining character of the Ectospora is\r\nthat the spore-mother-cells (sporoblasts) are formed at the periphery of\r\nthe parent-individual (sporont); we may, however, go further, and say\r\nthat the formation of all the different reproductive elements is\r\nuniformly peripheral or exogenous. Two other very general features are\r\n(a) that the individual trophozoite is uninuclear, and (b) that growth\r\nand trophic activity are finished before the multiplicative or\r\nreproductive phase sets in.\r\n\r\nThere is now little doubt that the Ectospora possess a flagellate\r\nancestry. The principal facts in favour of this view are as follows: the\r\nactual ontogenetic connexion known to exist between certain\r\nHaemoflagellates and certain Haemosporidia (see TRYPANOSOMES); the\r\npossession by many Coccidia of biflagellar microgametes (male elements),\r\nwhose general structure greatly resembles that of a Heteromastigine\r\nFlagellate; the possession by various parasitic Flagellates (e.g.\r\n_Herpetomonas_) of an attached, resting phase, when the parasites become\r\ngregariniform, which strongly suggests the attached phase of many young,\r\ngrowing Gregarines; the typical gregarinoid and euglenoid movements of\r\nGregarines and of the germs or other stages of Coccidia and\r\nHaemosporidia, which are quite comparable with the contractile and\r\nmetabolic movements of Flagellates; and, lastly, the exogenous type of\r\nreproduction, which is easily derivable from the multiple division of\r\ncertain Haemoflagellates, and this, in turn, from the typical binary\r\nlongitudinal fission of a Flagellate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nECUADOR\r\n\r\n  Boundaries.\r\n\r\n(officially _La Republica del Ecuador_), a republic of South America,\r\nbounded N. and N.E. by Colombia, S.E. and S. by Peru, and W. by the\r\nPacific Ocean. Its boundary lines with Colombia and Peru were in 1909\r\nstill unsettled, large areas of territory being claimed by all three\r\nrepublics. Under an agreement of the 15th of December 1894, the disputes\r\nwere to be decided by the Spanish sovereign as arbitrator, but nothing\r\nwas accomplished. On the 5th of November 1904, Colombia and Ecuador\r\nagreed to submit their dispute to the German emperor, and a convention\r\nof the 12th of September 1905 between Colombia and Peru established a\r\n_modus vivendi_ for the settlement of their conflicting claims, in which\r\nEcuador is likewise interested. The maps of Ecuador, which are very\r\ndefective, usually describe its territory as extending eastward to the\r\nBrazilian frontier, but as Peru is in actual occupation of the region\r\neast of Huiririma-chico, on the Napo river, 3-1/2 degrees west of that\r\nfrontier, those maps cannot be considered correct. The Trans-Andine\r\nterritory occupied by Ecuador is a wedge-shaped area between the Coca\r\nand Napo, the provisional boundary line with Colombia, and a line\r\nrunning nearly west-south-west from Huiririma-chico (about lat. 2 deg.\r\n50' S., long. 73 deg. 20' W.) to a point on the Santiago river in about\r\nlat. 4 deg. 12' S., long. 78 deg. W., which forms the provisional\r\nboundary with Peru. The eastern part of this territory is also claimed\r\nby Peru, which would have the effect, if allowed, of restricting Ecuador\r\nto a comparatively small area covered by the Andes and western\r\nCordillera and the narrow plain on the Pacific coast. From the Santiago\r\nriver, a western affluent of the Maranon, the boundary line runs\r\nsouth-west and west across the Andes to the head waters of the Macara,\r\ndown that stream to the Chira, or Achira, whose channel marks the\r\nfrontier down to about 80 deg. 17' W., where a small stream (the Rio\r\nAlamo) enters from the north. The line then runs almost due north to the\r\nsouth shore of the Gulf of Guayaquil, following the western water\r\nparting of the lower Tumbez valley. A small district in the valley of\r\nthe Chira is claimed by Peru. The northern boundary line is described\r\nelsewhere (see COLOMBIA). A small section of this line terminating on\r\nthe Pacific coast is also in dispute, Ecuador claiming the main channel\r\nof the Mira as the dividing line, and Colombia claiming a small district\r\nsouth of that channel, the line running due west from the mouth of the\r\nmost southern outlet of the Mira opening into Panguapi Bay, to a point\r\nof intersection with that river.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map of Ecuador.]\r\n\r\n  _Physical Geography._--The surface of Ecuador may be divided into\r\n  three distinct regions: the Cis-Andine lying between the Western\r\n  Cordillera and the coast; the Inter-Andine, which includes the two\r\n  great mountain chains crossing the republic with the elevated plateau\r\n  lying between; and the Trans-Andine, lying east of the Andes in the\r\n  great Amazon valley. The first part consists of an alluvial, low-lying\r\n  plain formed in great part by the detritus brought down by the\r\n  mountain streams. It is irregular in form and is broken by isolated\r\n  elevations and spurs from the Cordillera. Large areas are still\r\n  subject to annual inundations in the rainy season, and the lower river\r\n  courses are bordered with swamps. This is the most fertile and\r\n  productive part of Ecuador, especially on the higher lands near the\r\n  Cordillera. The Trans-Andine region is similar to the neighbouring\r\n  territories of the upper Amazon basin occupied by Colombia, Brazil and\r\n  Peru--a great forest-covered plain descending gently toward the east,\r\n  broken on its western margin by short spurs from the Andes enclosing\r\n  highly fertile valleys, and by low, isolated ranges between the larger\r\n  river courses, and traversed by large rivers flowing into the Napo and\r\n  Maranon. This region has been only partially explored, and but little\r\n  is known of the large areas lying between the navigable rivers.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mountains.\r\n\r\n  The Inter-Andine or plateau region lies in and between the two great\r\n  mountain chains which cross the greater part of the republic between\r\n  and almost parallel with the 78th and 79th meridians. The eastern\r\n  chain is known as the Andes of Ecuador, or the Cordillera Oriental,\r\n  and the western as the Cordillera Occidental (Western Cordillera).\r\n  Starting from the confused grouping on the southern frontier of the\r\n  two great chains and some transverse ranges, they run nearly north by\r\n  east to the Colombian frontier where another \"knot\" or junction\r\n  occurs. The summits of the western range form a line of noteworthy\r\n  regularity, but those of the eastern form a broken irregular line of\r\n  varying distances from the first. The elevated plateau between the two\r\n  great chains, which is about 300 m. long and 20 to 30 m. wide, is\r\n  divided into three great shallow basins or plains by the transverse\r\n  ridges or _paramos_ of Tiupullo and Azuay. These are known as the\r\n  Quito, Ambato and Cuenca basins. South of the latter is the irregular\r\n  and deeply broken Loja basin, which can hardly be considered a part of\r\n  the great Ecuador plateau. The three great basins, which are broken\r\n  and subdivided by mountainous spurs and ridges, descend gradually\r\n  toward the south, the Quito plain having an average elevation of 9500\r\n  ft. above the sea, Ambato 8500, and Cuenca 7800. They are also\r\n  characterized by the increasing aridity of the plateau from north to\r\n  south, the Quito plain being fertile and well covered with vegetation,\r\n  and the Ambato and Cuenca plains being barren and desolate except in\r\n  some favoured localities. The volcanic character of the region is\r\n  likewise responsible for large areas of barren surfaces. Rising from\r\n  this elevated plateau, along its eastern and western margins, are the\r\n  Cordilleras with their principal summits culminating far above the\r\n  line of perpetual snow, which in this region is about 15,750 ft. above\r\n  the sea. These summits are remarkable, not only for their great\r\n  height, but also for their apparent symmetrical arrangement in\r\n  parallel lines, sometimes in pairs facing each other across this\r\n  cyclopean passage. Nowhere in the world can there be found another\r\n  such assemblage of snow-clad peaks, several of which are active\r\n  volcanoes. There are 22 of them grouped around these central plains\r\n  almost within sight of each other. The western chain has the\r\n  distinction of having the highest summit, the eastern the greatest\r\n  number of high summits and the highest average elevation. From the\r\n  time of Humboldt's visit to this remarkable region down to the present\r\n  time there have been many diverse calculations of the height of these\r\n  peaks, but with a considerable variation. It is estimated that there\r\n  was a considerable decrease in the elevation of this part of the Andes\r\n  during the past century, Quito having sunk 26 ft. in 122 years,\r\n  Pichincha 218 ft. in the same time, and the farm of Antisana, where\r\n  Humboldt resided for a time, 165 ft. in 64 years. At the same time\r\n  Cotopaxi and Sangay, the two active volcanoes, have actually increased\r\n  in elevation since the measurement of La Condamine in 1742. These\r\n  changes in elevation, if correct, are due to seismic disturbances, a\r\n  cause that may be partially responsible for the varying computations\r\n  of the heights of these well-known peaks. Among modern investigators\r\n  are W. Reiss and A. Stubel (1871-1873), and Edward Whymper (1880),\r\n  whose measurements of the principal summits were:--\r\n\r\n            _Eastern Cordillera._             _Western Cordillera._\r\n    +--------------------------+--------+----------------------+--------+\r\n    |                          |   Ft.  |                      |   Ft.  |\r\n    +--------------------------+--------+----------------------+--------+\r\n    | Cayambe            (W.)  | 19,186 | Cotocachi      (W.)  | 16,301 |\r\n    | Sara-Urcu           \"    | 15,502 | Mojanda     (R. & S.)| 14,088 |\r\n    | Antisana            \"    | 19,335 | Pichincha      (W.)  | 15,918 |\r\n    | Sincholagua     (R. & S.)| 16,365 | Atacatzo    (R. & S.)| 14,892 |\r\n    | Ruminagui           \"    | 15,607 | El Corazon           |        |\r\n    | Cotopaxi           (W.)  | 19,613 |  (Chamalari)   (W.)  | 15,871 |\r\n    | Tunguragua      (R. & S.)| 16,690 | Iliniza     (R. & S.)| 17,405 |\r\n    | Altar (Capac-Urcu)  \"    | 17,730 | Carahuairazo   (W.)  | 16,515 |\r\n    | Sangay              \"    | 17,464 | Chimborazo      \"    | 20,498 |\r\n    +--------------------------+--------+----------------------+--------+\r\n\r\n  The Imbabura volcano, celebrated for its destructive eruptions of mud\r\n  and water, stands midway between the two ranges at the northern end of\r\n  the plateau, and belongs to the transverse ridge of knot (_nudo_)\r\n  which unites them. It is the most northern of the higher peaks of\r\n  Ecuador, with the exception of Cotocachi, and possibly of Chiles on\r\n  the Colombian frontier, and reaches the elevation of 15,033 ft. Ibarra\r\n  on the northern flanks of the volcano has suffered severely from its\r\n  eruptions. The name is derived from _imba_, fish, and _bura_, mother,\r\n  and is said to have originated from the quantities of a fish called\r\n  \"prenadilla\" (_Pimelodus cyclopum_) discharged from its crater during\r\n  one of its eruptions--a phenomenon which, after a searching\r\n  investigation, was discredited by Wagner. Cayambe, or Cayembi, the\r\n  second highest peak of the Ecuadorean Andes, has the noteworthy\r\n  distinction of standing very nearly on the equator. Its base covers a\r\n  large area, and its square top, rising far above the snow-line, is one\r\n  of the sights of Quito. Antisana is crowned with a double dome, and is\r\n  described as an extinct volcano, though Humboldt saw smoke issuing\r\n  from it in 1802. On its western side is the famous _hacienda_ (farm)\r\n  of Antisana, 13,306 ft. above the sea, where Humboldt resided for\r\n  several months in 1802. Sara-Urcu stands south-east of Antisana in a\r\n  densely forested region, drenched with rain and only slightly\r\n  explored. Sincholagua and Ruminagui are the next two peaks, going\r\n  southward, and then the unrivalled cone of Cotopaxi (q.v.)--the\r\n  highest active volcano in the world--from whose summit smoke curls\r\n  upward unceasingly.\r\n\r\n  Llanganati or Cerro Hermoso is chiefly known through the tradition\r\n  that the treasures of the Incas were buried in a lake on its slopes.\r\n  It consists of a group of summits, the highest being credited with\r\n  17,843 ft. Tunguragua, or Tungurahua, has a cone-shaped summit like\r\n  that of Cotopaxi, with a slope of 38 deg. It rises from a plain somewhat\r\n  lower than the neighbouring central plateau and stands free from the\r\n  surrounding elevations, except on the south, which give it an\r\n  exceptionally imposing appearance. Among its characteristic features\r\n  is a cataract fed by melting snows, which descends 1500 ft. in three\r\n  leaps, and an enormous basaltic lava-stream, which crosses the face of\r\n  the mountain in a north-easterly direction. Its most notable eruption\r\n  was in 1777. It has been sometimes classed among the extinct\r\n  volcanoes, but smoke has been seen issuing from it at different dates,\r\n  and a violent eruption occurred on January 12, 1886. The fertile\r\n  cultivated valley of Banos, with its thermal springs, lies at the base\r\n  of Tunguragua, which F. Hassaurek describes as \"the most beautiful of\r\n  all the snow peaks in the country.\" The next in line is El Altar,\r\n  which the natives call Capac-Urcu (\"king mountain\"), whose broken cone\r\n  and impressive outlines make it one of the most attractive mountains\r\n  of Ecuador. Its summit comprises a group of eight snow-clad peaks, and\r\n  its crater is surrounded by a steep and jagged wall of rocks. There is\r\n  a tradition that this mountain was once higher than Chimborazo, but a\r\n  series of eruptions caused the cone to fall in and reduced its summit\r\n  to its present altitude and broken appearance. Altar has shown no\r\n  signs of activity since the discovery of America. Sangay, or Sangai,\r\n  the next and last large volcano to the south, is in a state of\r\n  frequent eruption, however, and is known as one of the most restless\r\n  volcanoes of the world. Since the Spanish conquest it has been in a\r\n  state of uninterrupted activity, but no damage has been done, because\r\n  there are no civilized settlements in its immediate vicinity. Though\r\n  of great interest to scientific investigators because of this\r\n  unceasing activity, and of its peculiar position in the Andean system,\r\n  and because of the difficult and dangerous country by which it is\r\n  surrounded, Sangay has been but rarely visited by European travellers.\r\n  Its eruptions are not on a grand scale, but small outbursts of lava\r\n  and explosions of steam occur at frequent intervals, and at longer\r\n  intervals more violent explosions in which the molten rock is thrown\r\n  2000 ft. above its summit, and ashes are carried away as far as the\r\n  streets of Guayaquil.\r\n\r\n  Turning to the Cordillera Occidental and taking the principal peaks in\r\n  order from south to north, the first to claim attention is Chimborazo\r\n  (from _Chimpu-raza_, \"mountain of snow\"), the highest summit of\r\n  Ecuador, and once believed to be the culminating point of the Andes.\r\n  Humboldt, who unsuccessfully attempted its ascent in 1802, gives its\r\n  elevation as 21,425 ft., Reiss and Stubel as 20,703, and Whymper as\r\n  20,498. It stands 76 m. north-east of Guayaquil, and, according to\r\n  Spruce, rises majestically from the valley of the Guayas, on the west,\r\n  without a \"positive break from the summit down to the plain.\" This,\r\n  however, is erroneous, for Whymper located a detached range running\r\n  parallel with the Cordillera on the west, for a distance of 65 m. with\r\n  the Chimbo valley between them. The magnificence of its mass is\r\n  imposing from almost any point of view, but it can be most fully\r\n  appreciated from its western or Pacific side, where its base is\r\n  covered with forest up to the snow-line, above which its pure white\r\n  cone rises another 5000 ft. An unobstructed view of the great mountain\r\n  is rarely obtained, however, because of the mists and clouds which\r\n  cover its cone. Its summits were reached for the first time in 1880 by\r\n  Edward Whymper, all previous attempts having failed. It is considered\r\n  to be an extinct volcano because it makes the plumb-line deviate only\r\n  7\" to 8\", from which it is deduced that the mountain is hollow.\r\n  Moreover, the calcined matter resembling white sand which covers its\r\n  sides below the snow-line, extensive beds of lava, and the issue of\r\n  streams of hot water from its northern side, seem to confirm the\r\n  deduction that Chimborazo is an extinct volcano. Immediately north of\r\n  Chimborazo, and separated from it by only a narrow valley, are the\r\n  lower triple summits of Carahuairazo, or Carguairazo (which the\r\n  natives call _Chimborazo-embra_, \"Chimborazo's wife\"), whose hollow\r\n  cone collapsed in 1698 during a great earthquake, and left the jagged\r\n  rim which adds so much to its present picturesque appearance. Mr\r\n  Whymper's measurement is for the middle peak. Quirotoa, still farther\r\n  north, is supposed to have suffered a similar catastrophe. Its hollow\r\n  summit, 13,510 ft. above sea-level, now contains a large lake.\r\n  Iliniza, which stands west by north of Cotopaxi, has two pyramidal\r\n  peaks, and is one of the most interesting mountains of the Ecuadorean\r\n  group. It stands at the western end of the Tiupullo ridge, and\r\n  overlooks the Quito basin to the north-east. The French academician\r\n  Bouger, who was chief of the scientific commission sent to Ecuador in\r\n  1736 to measure a degree of the meridian on the equator, made a\r\n  trigonometrical measurement of Iliniza, and Wagner ascended to within\r\n  800 ft. of its summit in 1859. The geological structure of the\r\n  mountain furnishes no evidence of volcanic activity. Chamalari, which\r\n  the Spaniards called El Corazon from its heart-shaped appearance, is\r\n  similarly destitute of a crater. It overlooks the Quito basin and has\r\n  been ascended many times. Among the earlier explorers to reach its\r\n  summit were Bouger and La Condamine, Humboldt and Bonpland, and Jose\r\n  Caldas, the Granadian naturalist. Atacatzo is an extinct volcano, with\r\n  nothing noteworthy in its appearance and history. Pichincha, its\r\n  famous neighbour, is apparently of later origin, according to Wagner,\r\n  and of slightly lower elevation. Perhaps no Ecuadorean volcano is\r\n  better known than Pichincha, the \"boiling mountain,\" because of its\r\n  destructive eruptions and its proximity to the city of Quito. Its\r\n  summit comprises three groups of rocky peaks, of which the most\r\n  westerly, Rucu-Pichincha (Old Pichincha), contains the crater, a\r\n  funnel-shaped basin 2460 ft. deep and about 1500 ft. wide at the\r\n  bottom, whose walls in places rise perpendicularly and in others at an\r\n  angle of 20 deg. The exterior of the cone has an angle of 30 deg.\r\n  Bouger and La Condamine were the first to reach its brink in 1742,\r\n  after which Humboldt made the ascent in 1802, Boussingault and Hall in\r\n  1831, Garcia Moreno and Sebastian Wisse in 1844 and 1845 (descending\r\n  into the crater for the first time), Garcia Moreno and Jameson in\r\n  1857, Farrand and Hassaurek in 1862, Orton in 1867, and Whymper in\r\n  1880. Farrand spent more than a week in the crater trying to get some\r\n  good photographic views, and Orton has given a graphic description of\r\n  his experiences in the same place. He found that the real cone of\r\n  eruption was an irregular heap 250 ft. in height and 800 ft. in\r\n  diameter, containing about 70 vents. The temperature of the vapour\r\n  within the fumarole was 184 deg., and water boiled at 189 deg. There\r\n  have been five eruptions of Pichincha since the Spanish conquest--in\r\n  1539, 1566, 1575, 1587 and 1660. The second covered Quito 3 ft. deep\r\n  with ashes and stones, but the last three were considered as the most\r\n  destructive to that city. The last happily broke down the western side\r\n  of the crater, which, it is believed, will ensure the city against\r\n  harm in any subsequent eruption. Since the earthquake of August 1867\r\n  Pichincha has sent forth dense masses of black smoke and great\r\n  quantities of fine sand. Cotocachi is a double-peaked mountain, rising\r\n  from an extremely rough country. It was ascended by Whymper in 1880.\r\n  All the higher summits of Ecuador have true glaciers, the largest\r\n  being found on Antisana, Cayambe and Chimborazo. Whymper located and\r\n  named no less than eleven on Chimborazo, and counted twelve on\r\n  Cayambe.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Rivers.\r\n\r\n  There are two distinct hydrographic systems in Ecuador--the streams\r\n  that flow south-eastward to the Maranon, or Amazon, and those which\r\n  flow westward to the Pacific. The southern part of the great central\r\n  plateau is arid and has a very light rainfall; it has no streams,\r\n  therefore, except from melting snows, and the higher elevations which\r\n  receive the impact of the easterly winds. Farther north the rainfall\r\n  becomes heavier, the plateau is covered with vegetation, and a\r\n  considerable number of small rivers flow westward through the\r\n  Cordillera to the Pacific. The Eastern Cordillera, or Andes, forms the\r\n  water-parting between the two systems. The largest of the\r\n  eastward-flowing rivers is the Napo, which rises in the eastern\r\n  defiles of Cotopaxi and Sincholagua--the principal source being the\r\n  Rio del Valle, which traverses the Valle Vicioso. It at first flows\r\n  south by east, and at the village of Napo is 1450 ft. above sea-level,\r\n  at the mouth of the Coca 858 ft., at the mouth of the Aguarico 586\r\n  ft., 500 at the mouth of the Curaray, and 385 at its junction with the\r\n  Maranon. Orton estimates its current at Napo in the month of November\r\n  as 6 m. an hour; in the next 80 m. the river falls 350 ft. and\r\n  produces a fine series of rapids; and from Santa Rosa downwards the\r\n  rate is not less than 4 m. an hour. Its breadth at Napo is only 120\r\n  ft., but at Coca it has widened to 1500 ft., and at its mouth to\r\n  nearly 1 m. Like most of the large Amazon tributaries, its discharge\r\n  into the Maranon is through several distinct channels. The Napo is\r\n  navigable for steam-boats for some distance above the mouth of the\r\n  Coca, and thence for canoes as far as the Cando cataract, 3332 ft.\r\n  above the sea. Its total length is 920 m. The principal tributaries of\r\n  the Napo are the Coca and Aguarico from the north, and the Curaray\r\n  from the south. The Coca rises on the eastern slopes of the Andes near\r\n  Cayambe and the Guamani range, and flows eastward near the equator to\r\n  San Rafael (about 76 deg. 30' W. long.), where it turns sharply\r\n  southward to a junction with the Napo in about lat. 1 deg. S., long.\r\n  76 deg. W. The Coca forms the provisional boundary line between\r\n  Ecuador and Colombia from its source to the Napo. The Aguarico also\r\n  rises on the eastern slopes of the Andes north of Cayambe and flows\r\n  south-eastward to a junction with the Napo in about long. 75 deg. W.,\r\n  its length being roughly estimated at 420 m. Little is known of its\r\n  course, or of the country through which it flows, which is\r\n  provisionally occupied by Colombia. The Curaray has its sources in the\r\n  defiles of the Cerros de Llanganati, and flows south-eastward to the\r\n  Napo, its length being estimated at 490 m. Its lower course is\r\n  sluggish, where its waters are made unpalatable by a reddish slime.\r\n  The Napo and its tributaries are celebrated in the early history of\r\n  South America as the route by which Gonzalo Pizarro and Orellana first\r\n  reached the Amazon, and it was afterwards the principal route by which\r\n  the early expeditions across the continent at this point connected the\r\n  Andean Plateau with the Amazon. The other rivers which flow through\r\n  the Oriente territory of Ecuador into the Maranon are the Tigre,\r\n  Pastaza, Morona and Santiago. The Tigre, of which little was known\r\n  until a recent date, is formed by the confluence of the Cunambo and\r\n  Huiviyacu, whose sources are on the eastern slopes of the Andes near\r\n  those of the Curaray. Its length below this confluence is 416 m., into\r\n  which are received 109 tributaries, the largest of which are the\r\n  Pucacuro and Corrientes. The Tigre is navigable at all stages up to\r\n  the Cunambo confluence, and promises to afford one of the most\r\n  valuable river routes in Ecuador. It enters the Maranon very near the\r\n  74th meridian. The Pastaza, or Pastassa, unlike the rivers already\r\n  described, has its source on the central plateau west of the principal\r\n  chain of the Andes, within the shadow of Cotopaxi, and breaks through\r\n  the Cordillera to the north of Tunguragua. After flowing southward\r\n  along the base of the high Andes for a short distance and receiving a\r\n  number of torrents from the snowclad heights, it turns south-eastward\r\n  across the plain and enters the Maranon about 70 m. above the mouth of\r\n  the Huallaga. The stream is known as the Patate down to its junction\r\n  with the Chambo, near Banos, and is not called Pastaza until the\r\n  Agoyan falls are passed. It was navigated by Don Pedro Maldonado as\r\n  early as 1741, and is navigable for steamboats of 2 to 4 ft. draft up\r\n  to the mouth of the Huasaga (about 124 m.) in times of high water, and\r\n  for canoes nearly 200 m. farther. The Pastaza, however, is subject to\r\n  irresistible floods caused by the sudden rising of the mountain\r\n  torrents on its upper course, especially the Toro, which sweep down\r\n  with such fury that navigation on the river is practically impossible.\r\n  The shallowness of the lower stream, where the current is sluggish, is\r\n  probably due to the great quantities of silt brought down by these\r\n  floods. Many of the rivers of eastern Ecuador are subject to similar\r\n  floods from the Andean slopes, which have cut away broad, deep\r\n  channels, through the adjacent plains, leaving long, narrow ridges\r\n  between their courses which the natives call _cuchillas_. The Morona\r\n  is formed by the confluence of the Manhuasisa and Cangaima about 310\r\n  m. above its mouth, and is freely navigable for small steamboats to\r\n  that point. The two confluents just mentioned have their sources in\r\n  the Andes, and flow for some distance across the plain before uniting\r\n  to form the Morona. Both are navigable for considerable distances. The\r\n  Morona follows a very tortuous course before entering the Maranon, at\r\n  long. 70 deg. W., and receives a large number of affluents, one of\r\n  which serves as the outlet for Lake Rimachuma, in Peruvian territory.\r\n  Very little is definitely known of the affluents of the Morona,\r\n  Pastaza and Tigre, as the territory through which they run has been\r\n  but slightly explored. The Santiago, which enters the Maranon near the\r\n  Pongo de Manseriche, is formed by the confluence of the Paute, which\r\n  rises in the province of Azuay, and the Zamora, which has its source\r\n  among the mountains of Loja. According to Alexander Garland (_Peru in\r\n  1906_), the rivers of eastern Ecuador are navigable at low water for\r\n  steamers of 2 to 4 ft. draft for an aggregate distance of 1503 m., as\r\n  follows:--\r\n\r\n                                              Miles.\r\n    Napo, to the mouth of the Aguarico         559\r\n    Curaray, up to Canonaco                    286\r\n    Tigre, up to Cunambo-Huiviyacu confluence  416\r\n    Pastaza                                     31\r\n    Morona, up to the Rarayacu                 211\r\n\r\n  These same rivers are navigable at high water for steamers of 19-1/2\r\n  ft. draft for an aggregate distance of 1330 m., including 68 m. of the\r\n  Aguarico, and for steamers of 2 to 4 ft. draft for an additional 733\r\n  m. The last aggregate includes an extension of 93 m. on the Pastaza,\r\n  99 on the Morona, 186 on the Napo, and the balance on the Manhuasisa,\r\n  Cangaima, Pucacuro, Corrientes, Cunambo and Huiviyacu.\r\n\r\n  On the western versant of the Andes of Ecuador there are three river\r\n  systems of considerable size--the Mira, the Esmeraldas and the Guayas.\r\n  The sources of the first--the Rioblanco, Pisco and Puntal--are to be\r\n  found on the northern slopes of the transverse ridge which culminates\r\n  in the Imbabura volcano. Its course is north and north-west to the\r\n  Colombian frontier, thence westward and north-west to the Pacific,\r\n  breaking through the Western Cordillera on its way. It forms the\r\n  boundary line for some distance between Ecuador and Colombia, but near\r\n  its mouth where the river turns northward Colombia has taken\r\n  possession of the left bank and all the territory covered by its large\r\n  delta. Its principal tributaries on the left are the San Pedro,\r\n  Paramba, Cachiyacu, Chachavi and Canumbi, and on the right the San\r\n  Juan, Caiquer and Nulpe. The delta channels of the Mira are navigable,\r\n  being tributary to the Colombian port of Tumaco. The Esmeraldas drains\r\n  all that part of the central plateau lying between the transverse\r\n  ridge of Tiupullo on the south, and the Imbabura ridge on the north,\r\n  together with the western slopes of the Cordillera between Iliniza and\r\n  Cotocachi, and a considerable part of the lower plain. It is formed by\r\n  the confluence of the Quininde and Toachi with the Guaillabamba\r\n  between 40 and 50 m. above its mouth, and discharges into the Pacific\r\n  in lat. 1 deg. N., long. 79 deg. 40' W., through a narrow and\r\n  precipitous gorge. The volume and current of the river is sufficient\r\n  to freshen the sea 2 m. from the coast. The Guaillabamba is the larger\r\n  and more important tributary, and should be considered the main\r\n  stream. It rises in the Chillo valley in the vicinity of Cayambe, and\r\n  flows across the northern end of the central plateau, breaking through\r\n  the Western Cordillera between Cotocachi and Pichincha. One of its\r\n  plateau tributaries, Rio Pedregal, rises on the slopes of Cotopaxi and\r\n  is celebrated for its three beautiful cascades, the highest of which\r\n  is about 220 ft. The Toachi and Quininde have their sources on the\r\n  western slopes of the Cordillera. The Guayas or Guayaquil river is in\r\n  part an estuary extending northward from the Gulf of Guayaquil,\r\n  bordered by mangrove swamps and mud banks formed by the silt brought\r\n  down from the neighbouring mountains. All the bordering country on\r\n  both sides is of the same description, and for a long distance inland\r\n  extensive areas of swampy country are submerged during the rainy\r\n  season. Above the mouth of the Daule the river is known as the\r\n  Bodegas, which in turn is formed by the confluence of the Babahoyo and\r\n  the Vinces. The Guayas also receives a large tributary from the east\r\n  called the Yaguachi. All these streams are navigable on their lower\r\n  courses, regular steamboat communication being maintained on the\r\n  Guayas and Bodegas to a river port of the latter name, 80 m. above\r\n  Guayaquil, and for 40 m. on the Daule. The navigable channels of all\r\n  the rivers are computed at 200 m. The drainage basin of the Guayas,\r\n  according to Theodor Wolf, covers an area of 14,000 sq. m., and\r\n  includes the greater part of the lower plain and the western slopes of\r\n  the Cordillera Occidental as far north as Iliniza. The Babahoyo, which\r\n  is the main stream, has its sources on the slopes of Chimborazo, the\r\n  Daule on the Sandomo ridge in the latitude of Pichincha, the Yaguachi\r\n  on the south-eastern slopes of Chimborazo, whence it flows southward\r\n  for a considerable distance before breaking through the Cordillera to\r\n  the western plain. The Guayas is one of the most interesting and\r\n  varied of the South American river systems, and is of great economic\r\n  importance to Ecuador. In addition to these three river systems, there\r\n  are a large number of short streams on the coast flowing into the\r\n  Pacific and Gulf of Guayaquil, only two of which have any special\r\n  importance in the present undeveloped state of the country. These are\r\n  the Santiago, which drains several fertile valleys in northern\r\n  Esmeraldas and western Carchi, and whose outlet is connected with some\r\n  navigable tide-water channels, including the Pailon basin and the\r\n  Caraquez, or Caracas, on which is located the village of Bahia de\r\n  Caraquez (lat. 0 deg. 34' S.), the nearest port to the city of Quito.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Lakes.\r\n\r\n  There are a considerable number of small lakes in Ecuador, but no\r\n  large ones. These are of two classes--those of the bowl-like valleys\r\n  and extinct craters of the mountainous region, and the reservoir lakes\r\n  of the lowland plains caused by the annual overflow of the rivers. It\r\n  is impossible to say how many of the latter there may be, for much of\r\n  the territory where they are found is unexplored. They are usually\r\n  shallow and malarial. Among the upland lakes, there are some of\r\n  special interest because of their position and historical association.\r\n  The Yaguar-cocha (\"lake of blood\"), in the province of Imbabura, near\r\n  Ibarra, which is only 1-1/2 m. in circumference, is celebrated for the\r\n  tradition that Huayna-Capac, one of the great conquerors of the Inca\r\n  dynasty, defeated an army of rebellious Carranquis on its shores, and\r\n  threw so many of their bleeding corpses into it as to turn its waters\r\n  to the colour of blood. On the south-east skirt of Cotocachi, 10,200\r\n  ft. above the sea, is the beautiful little Cuy-cocha, which\r\n  originated, it is believed, through the falling in of the mountain's\r\n  sides. There are two others of apparently the same origin on the\r\n  north-west slopes of the Mojanda volcano, but they are less attractive\r\n  because of their gloomy surroundings. In the deep valley between the\r\n  mountains of Imbabura and Mojanda is the lake of San Pablo, 8848 ft.\r\n  above the sea. It is one of the largest of its class, being about 5 m.\r\n  in circumference, and is situated in an exceptionally fertile region.\r\n  It drains through the Peguchi into the Rio Blanco, a tributary of the\r\n  Mira. Other well-known lakes of the plateau region are Quirotoa, about\r\n  4600 ft. in diameter; Colta, east of Riobamba, and Colay, south of the\r\n  same place. Among the many thermal springs throughout the Andean\r\n  districts, the best known are at Belermos and San Pedro del Tingo,\r\n  north-east of Quito; at Cachillacta, in the district of Nanegal; at\r\n  Timbugpoyo, near Latacunga; at Banos (5906 ft. elevation), near the\r\n  foot of Tunguragua; and on the slopes of Ruminagui and Chimborazo.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Coast.\r\n\r\n  The coast of Ecuador extends from about lat. 1 deg. 20' N. to the\r\n  vicinity of the Boca Jambeli on the southern shore of the Gulf of\r\n  Guayaquil, in lat. 3 deg. 14' S., and has an outward curve. Its more\r\n  prominent headlands are Punta Galera, Cabo Pasado, Cabo de San Lorenzo\r\n  and La Puntilla, or Santa Elena Point. The bays on this coast are\r\n  commonly broad indentations, and the rivers discharging into them are\r\n  generally obstructed by bars. The small ports along the coast,\r\n  therefore, do not afford much protection to shipping. The most\r\n  northern of these bays is the Ancon de Sardinas, lying south of the\r\n  Mira delta. The head of the bay is fringed with islands and reefs,\r\n  behind which is the mouth of the Santiago river, Poza Harbour, San\r\n  Lorenzo Bay, Pailon basin and a network of navigable channels, all of\r\n  which are difficult of access. The small ports of La Tola and Pailon\r\n  are located on these waters. The port of Esmeraldas, near the mouth of\r\n  the Esmeraldas river, is located near the southern entrance to this\r\n  bay. As the mouth of the river is obstructed by a bar and its current\r\n  is swift, the anchorage is outside in an open roadstead, only slightly\r\n  protected on the south. Farther south is the broad Bay of Manta, with\r\n  a small port of the same name at its southern extremity. The most\r\n  frequented port on this part of the coast is that of Bahia de\r\n  Caraquez, at the mouth of the Caraquez, or Caracas river, which is\r\n  also obstructed by a bar. There is a fertile, productive country back\r\n  of this port, and it is the objective point of a road from Quito.\r\n  Immediately north of the Gulf of Guayaquil is the Bay of Santa Elena,\r\n  with a small port of the same name, which has a good, well-sheltered\r\n  anchorage and is the landing-place of the West Coast cable. The Gulf\r\n  of Guayaquil, which lies between the Ecuadorean and Peruvian coasts,\r\n  is the largest gulf on the Pacific coast of South America between\r\n  Panama and Chiloe. Its mouth is 140 m. wide between La Puntilla on the\r\n  north and Cabo Blanco on the south, and it penetrates the land\r\n  eastward, with a slight curve northward at its head, for a distance of\r\n  about 100 m., terminating in the Guayas estuary or river, on which is\r\n  located the port of Guayaquil. The upper end of the bay and its\r\n  northern shores are fringed with swamps through which numerous\r\n  estuaries penetrate for some distance inland. Immediately west of the\r\n  Guayas river the Estero Salado, which comprises a great many shallow\r\n  tide-water channels, or bayous, penetrates as far inland as Guayaquil,\r\n  but is used only by canoes. The upper end of the gulf is filling up\r\n  with the silt brought down from the Cordillera. It is divided midway\r\n  by the large island of Puna, at the eastern end of which is the\r\n  anchorage for steamers too large to ascend the Guayas. The steamship\r\n  channel passes between this island and the Peruvian coast, and is\r\n  known as the Jambeli channel. The passage north of Puna Island is\r\n  known as the Morro channel, but its entrance is obstructed by shoals\r\n  and it is considered dangerous for shipping. A small port in the\r\n  Jambeli channel, on the south-east shore of the gulf, is that of\r\n  Puerto Bolivar, or Puerto Huaila, the shipping port for the town of\r\n  Machala and the Zaruma mining region.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Islands.\r\n\r\n  There are few islands off the coast of Ecuador, and only one of any\r\n  considerable size--that of Puna in the Gulf of Guayaquil, which is 29\r\n  m. long from north-east to south-west and 8 to 14 m. wide. It lies in\r\n  the north-east part of the gulf, and is separated from the Ecuadorean\r\n  mainland by the Morro channel, and from the southern mainland by the\r\n  wider and deeper Jambeli channel. There is a low, mountainous ridge,\r\n  called the Zampo Palo, running through it, and its eastern shores have\r\n  some moderately high bluffs; otherwise the island is low and swampy,\r\n  and its shores, except the eastern end, are fringed with mud banks.\r\n  The island is densely wooded (in marked contrast with the opposite\r\n  Peruvian shore), and is considered unhealthy throughout the greater\r\n  part. It has a population of 200, chiefly centred in the village of\r\n  Puna, at its north-east extremity, which is a shipping port and health\r\n  resort for the city of Guayaquil. Puna island is celebrated for its\r\n  connexion with Pizarro's invasion of Peru in 1531. It is said that it\r\n  had a considerable population at that time, and that the natives\r\n  resisted the invaders so vigorously that it cost six months to reduce\r\n  them. Midway in the outer part of the Gulf of Guayaquil is Amortajada\r\n  or Santa Clara island, whose resemblance to a shrouded corpse\r\n  suggested the name which it bears. It lies 12 m. south-west of Puna\r\n  island and 80 m. from Guayaquil. It rises to a considerable elevation,\r\n  and carries a light 256 ft. above sea-level. There are some low,\r\n  swampy islands, or mud flats, covered with mangrove thickets, in the\r\n  lower Guayas river, but they are uninhabited and of no importance.\r\n  North of the Gulf of Guayaquil there are only two small islands on the\r\n  coast of more than local interest. The first of these is Salango, in\r\n  lat. 1 deg. 25' S., which is 2 m. in circumference and rises to a\r\n  height of 524 ft. It is richly wooded, and has a well-sheltered\r\n  anchorage much frequented by whalers in search of water and fresh\r\n  provisions. The next is La Plata, in lat. 1 deg. 16' S., which rises\r\n  to a height of 790 ft., and has a deep anchorage on its eastern side\r\n  where Drake is said to have anchored in 1579 to divide the spoils of\r\n  the Spanish treasure ship \"Cacafuego.\" The Galapagos Islands (q.v.)\r\n  belong to the republic of Ecuador, and form a part of the province of\r\n  Guayas.\r\n\r\n  _Geology._[1]--The great longitudinal depression which lies between\r\n  the eastern and the western branches of the Andes is also the boundary\r\n  between the ancient rocks of the east and the Mesozoic beds which\r\n  form the greater part of the west of the country. The Eastern\r\n  Cordillera is composed of gneiss, mica and chlorite schist and other\r\n  crystalline rocks of ancient date; the Western Cordillera, on the\r\n  other hand, is formed of porphyritic eruptive rocks of Mesozoic age,\r\n  together with sedimentary deposits containing Cretaceous fossils. Most\r\n  of the country between the Andes and the sea is covered by Tertiary\r\n  and Quaternary beds; but the range of hills which runs north-west from\r\n  Guayaquil is formed of Cretaceous and porphyritic rocks similar to\r\n  those of the Andes. In the intra-andine depression, between the East\r\n  and West Cordilleras, recent deposits with plant remains occur near\r\n  Loja, and to the north-east of Cuenca is a sandstone containing\r\n  mercury ores, somewhat similar to that of Peru. Farther north nearly\r\n  the whole of the depression is filled with lavas, tuffs and\r\n  agglomerates, derived from the Tertiary and recent volcanoes which\r\n  form the most striking feature of the Andes of Ecuador. These\r\n  volcanoes are most numerous in the northern half of the country, and\r\n  they stand indifferently upon the folded Mesozoic beds of the Western\r\n  Cordillera (e.g. Chimborazo, Iliniza, Pichincha), the ancient rocks of\r\n  the Eastern Cordillera (Altar, Tunguragua, Cotopaxi, Antisana), or the\r\n  floor of the great depression between. The lavas and ashes are for the\r\n  most part andesitic.\r\n\r\n  _Climate._--Climatic conditions in Ecuador are very largely contingent\r\n  on altitude, and the transition from one climate to another is a\r\n  matter of only a few hours' journey. Although the equator crosses the\r\n  northern part of the republic, only 15 m. north of the city Of Quito,\r\n  a very considerable part of its area has the temperature of the\r\n  temperate zone, and snow-crowned summits are to be seen every day in\r\n  the year from its great central plateau. In addition to the climatic\r\n  changes due to altitude, there are others caused by local arid\r\n  conditions, by volcanic influences and by the influence of mountain\r\n  ranges on the temperature and rainfall of certain districts. These\r\n  influences are not general; on the contrary, they often affect very\r\n  limited areas. For instance, Guayaquil has a hot humid climate and\r\n  mangrove swamps line the shores of Guayas down to the gulf; at Santa\r\n  Elena, about 60 m. due west, arid conditions prevail and vegetation is\r\n  scanty and dwarfed; at Salango island, 50 m. north of Santa Elena,\r\n  there is an abundance of moisture and vegetation is luxuriant; 33 m.\r\n  farther north, at Manta, the country is a desert; and at Atacames bay,\r\n  135 m. north of Manta, the rainfall and vegetation are again\r\n  favourable. On the plateau similar conditions prevail. There is no\r\n  great display of arboreal vegetation anywhere except in the valleys\r\n  and lower passes where the rainfall is abundant, but in general terms\r\n  it may be said that the rainfall and vegetation which characterize the\r\n  Quito basin soon disappear as one proceeds southward, and are\r\n  substituted by arid conditions. Even here there are local\r\n  modifications, as at Ambato, where a shallow depression, surrounded by\r\n  barren, dust-covered ridges exposed to cold winds, is celebrated for\r\n  its warm, equable climate and its fruit. It is to be noted that the\r\n  Gulf of Guayaquil separates the humid, forest-covered coastal plain of\r\n  Ecuador from the arid, barren coast of Peru, the two regions being\r\n  widely dissimilar. The mean annual temperature, on this plain,\r\n  according to an official publication, is 82.4 deg. F., and the range\r\n  is from 66 deg. to 95 deg. The heat is modified at many points on the\r\n  coast, however, by the cold Humboldt current which sweeps up the west\r\n  coast of South America from the Antarctic seas. The year is divided\r\n  into a wet and dry season--the former running from December to June,\r\n  and the latter from July to December. The rainy season, or _invierno_,\r\n  is broken by a short period of dry weather, called the _veranillo_\r\n  (little summer), shortly after the December solstice; otherwise it\r\n  rains every day, the streams overflow, land traffic is suspended, and\r\n  the air is drenched with moisture and becomes oppressive and\r\n  pestiferous. The dry season, which is called the _verano_, or summer,\r\n  is also broken by a short rainy spell called the _inviernillo_ (little\r\n  winter) or \"cordonazo de San Francisco,\" which follows the September\r\n  equinox. Apart from these the two seasons are sometimes broken by\r\n  cloudless skies in winter, and a drizzling mist, called the _garua_,\r\n  in summer. In the inter-andine region the variations in temperature\r\n  are frequent and the averages comparatively low. An official estimate\r\n  gives the mean annual temperature as 64 deg. to 68 deg. between 6000\r\n  and 11,000 ft. In Quito the mean annual temperature is 58.8 deg., the\r\n  diurnal variation 10 deg., the annual maximum 70 deg., and the annual\r\n  minimum 45 deg. Other returns give the mean annual temperature at 55\r\n  deg. It is said that pulmonary tuberculosis is unknown in these\r\n  altitudes, though it is common in the coast districts. Catarrhal\r\n  complaints are common, however, and leprosy is widely prevalent, it\r\n  being necessary to maintain three large hospitals for lepers. In the\r\n  higher altitudes there are wide variations in the snow-fall and\r\n  intensity of the cold even on the same mountain. The line of permanent\r\n  snow is much higher on the plateau side in both ranges, the\r\n  precipitation being greater on the outer sides--those facing the\r\n  forested lowlands--and the terrestrial radiation being greater from\r\n  the barren surfaces of the plateau. In some instances the difference\r\n  in the elevation of the snow-line has been found to be fully 1000 ft.\r\n  Moreover, no two summits seem to retain the snow permanently at the\r\n  same altitude. For instance, in 1880 Whymper found permanent snow on\r\n  Cotocachi at 14,500 ft., while near by Imbabura was bare to its summit\r\n  (15,033 ft.); Antisana was permanently covered at 16,000 ft., and near\r\n  by Sara-Urcu, which is drenched with rains and mists from the Amazon\r\n  valley all the year round, at 14,000 ft.; Sincholagua had large beds\r\n  of permanent snow at 15,300 ft., Cotopaxi was permanently covered at\r\n  15,500 ft. on its western side, Corazon had daily snowstorms down to\r\n  14,500 ft., but no permanent beds of snow on its east side (elevation\r\n  15,871 ft.); and Chimborazo had deep snow at 15,600 ft. on its\r\n  north-east and south sides in June--July. The eastern range was found\r\n  to receive the heaviest snowfall. The elevation at which human\r\n  residence is possible seems to be unusually high in Ecuador. Many of\r\n  the towns and villages of central Ecuador lie at altitudes ranging\r\n  from 8606 ft. (Ambato) to 9839 ft. (Machachi). The capital city of\r\n  Quito is 9343 ft. above the sea, and is celebrated for its agreeable\r\n  temperature, and also for its healthiness in spite of prevailing\r\n  unsanitary conditions. Above these towns are a number of farms and\r\n  herdsmen's habitations, where men live the whole or a part of the year\r\n  with less discomfort from low temperature than is experienced in\r\n  northern Europe and northern United States. According to Whymper, the\r\n  _tambo_ of Chuquipoquio, at the foot of Chimborazo, is 11,704 ft., and\r\n  the _hacienda_ of Pedregal, near Iliniza, 11,629 ft., both being\r\n  permanently occupied. The _hacienda_ of Antisana, 13,306 ft., and the\r\n  herdsmen's hut of Cunayaco on Chimborazo, 13,396 ft., are occupied\r\n  only for a part of the year. The highest elevations are generally\r\n  covered with ice and snow, and glaciers, according to Whymper, are to\r\n  be found upon no less than nine of the culminating peaks, and possibly\r\n  upon two or three more. These serve to modify the temperatures of the\r\n  plateau, which is swept by cold winds at all seasons of the year. The\r\n  prevailing wind is that of the north-east and south-east trade winds,\r\n  broken and modified on the plateau and western lowlands by mountain\r\n  barriers. Westerly and north-west winds are sometimes experienced, but\r\n  are not permanent.\r\n\r\n  _Flora._--The flora of the Quito basin has been well studied by\r\n  various European botanists, more especially by Dr William Jameson\r\n  (1796-1873) of the university of Quito, who began the preparation of a\r\n  synopsis of the Ecuadorean flora in 1864-1865 (_Synopsis plantarum\r\n  Quitensium_, 2 vols., Quito, 1865). The flora of the forested lowlands\r\n  on both sides of the Andes has not been studied and described so\r\n  fully. From the Pacific coast upward to a height of about 3000 to 4000\r\n  ft. the vegetation is distinctively tropical, including among its\r\n  economic products cacao, cotton, sugar, tobacco, rice, maize, yucca\r\n  (also known as cassava and mandioca), peanuts, bananas, sweet\r\n  potatoes, yams, arracacha (_Conium moschatum_, H.B.K., or _Arracacha\r\n  esculenta_), indigo, rubber (_Castilloa_), ivory-nuts, cinchona and\r\n  bread-fruit. Most of these become rare at 3000 ft., but a few, like\r\n  sugar-cane, are cultivated as high as 8000 ft. The alluvial valley of\r\n  the Guayas, above Guayaquil, is celebrated for the richness of its\r\n  vegetation, which, in fruit alone, includes cacao, coffee, coco-nuts,\r\n  pine-apples, oranges, lemons, guayavas (_Psidium pomiferum_), guavas\r\n  (_Inga spectabilis_), shaddocks (or grape-fruit), pomegranates,\r\n  apricots, chirimoyas (_Anona Chirimolia_), granadillas (_Passiflora\r\n  quadrangularis_), paltas (_Persea gratissima_, otherwise known as\r\n  \"alligator pears\"), tunas (_Cactus_), mangoes (_Mangifera Indica_),\r\n  pacays (_Prosopis dulcis_), aji (Chile pepper), and many others of\r\n  less importance. Besides rubber, the forests produce a great variety\r\n  of cabinet and construction woods, ivory-nuts (from the \"tagua\" palm,\r\n  _Phytelephas macrocarpa_), \"toquilla\" fibre (_Carludovica palmata_)\r\n  for the manufacture of so-called Panama hats, cabbage palms, several\r\n  species of cinchona, vanilla and dyewoods. Among the large trees which\r\n  are valued for their timber are redwood (_Humiria balsamifera_),\r\n  Brazil-wood, algarrobo, palo de cruz (_Jacquinea ruscifolia_),\r\n  guaiacum or holy wood, rosewood, cedar and walnut. From 6000 to 10,000\r\n  ft. above the sea, the indigenous species include the potato, maize,\r\n  oca (_Oxalis tuberosa_), and quinua (_Chenopodium quinoa_), and the\r\n  exotic species, wheat, barley, oats, alfalfa (_Medicago sativa_), and\r\n  most of the fruits and vegetables of the northern temperate zone.\r\n  Wheat does not form a head below 4500 ft., nor ripen above 10,500. The\r\n  larger forest trees are rarely seen above 10,000 ft., and even there\r\n  only on the outer slopes of the Cordilleras. The _Escallonia\r\n  myrtalloides_, however, is found at an elevation of 13,000 ft., and\r\n  the shrubby _Befarias_ 400 or 500 ft. higher. A characteristic growth\r\n  of the open plateau and upland valleys is the cabulla, cabaya or\r\n  maguey (_Agave americana_), whose fibre is much used by the natives in\r\n  the manufacture of cordage, sandals (_alpargatas_) and other useful\r\n  articles. In the treeless region lying between 11,600 and 13,800, or\r\n  in other places between 12,000 and 14,000 ft., the similarity of the\r\n  vegetation to that of the corresponding European region, according to\r\n  Wagner, is especially striking. On the _paramos_ of Chimborazo,\r\n  Pichincha, Iliniza, &c., the relation of characteristic genera to\r\n  those identical with genera in the Alpine flora of Europe is as 5 to\r\n  4; and the botanist might almost suppose himself in the Upper\r\n  Engadine. Of the flora of the highest Andes, Whymper found 42 species,\r\n  of various orders, above 16,000 ft., almost all of which were from\r\n  Antisana and Chimborazo; 12 genera of mosses were found above 15,000\r\n  ft., and 59 species of flowering plants above 14,000 ft., of which 35\r\n  species came from above 15,000 and 20 species from above 16,000 ft.\r\n  The highest specimen obtained was a lichen (_Lecanora subfusca_, L.)\r\n  on the south side of Chimborazo, 18,400 ft. above sea-level. Mosses\r\n  (_Grimmia_) were found on Chimborazo at 16,660 ft., ferns (_Polypodium\r\n  pycnolepis_, Kze.) at 14,900, and specimens of _Gentiana rupicola_, H.\r\n  B. K., _Achyrophorus quitensis_, Sz. Bip., _Culcitium nivale_, H. B.\r\n  K., at 16,300; _Phyllactis inconspicua_, Wedd., at 16,600,\r\n  _Astragalus geminiflorus_, H. B. K., at 14-15,000, _Geranium\r\n  diffusum_, H. B. K., at 16,000, _Malvastrum phyllanthos_, Asa Gray, at\r\n  16,500, _Draba obovata_, Benth., at 16,660, and _Ranunculus\r\n  praemorsus_, Kth., at 16,500--all on Chimborazo. _Fuchsia loxensis_,\r\n  H. B. K., was found on the slope of Sara-Urcu at 12,779 ft., and\r\n  currant bushes (_Ribes glandulosum_, R. & P.), on Chimborazo, at\r\n  14,000. On the eastern slopes of the Andes, where the rainfall is\r\n  continuous throughout the year and the atmosphere is surcharged with\r\n  moisture, the forest growth is phenomenal. It is similar to that of\r\n  the Colombian and Peruvian _montanas_, modified, if at all, by the\r\n  excessive humidity which prevails in this region.\r\n\r\n  _Fauna._--The fauna of Ecuador is comparatively poor in mammalia, but\r\n  the birds and still more the insects are very numerous. The Quadrumana\r\n  are represented by a large number of species, the eastern forests\r\n  being very much like the other parts of the great Amazonian basin in\r\n  this respect. The Carnivora include the puma (_Felis concolor_),\r\n  jaguar (_F. onca_), ocelot (_F. grisea_), bear (_Ursus ornatus_), fox,\r\n  weasel and otter. A small deer and, in southern Ecuador, the llama\r\n  (_Auchenia_) with its allied species, the alpaca, guanaco and vicuna,\r\n  represent the ruminants. The rodents are numerous and include most, if\r\n  not all, of the Amazonian species--the capybara (_Hydrochoerus\r\n  capybara_), cavia (_C. aperea_), paca (_Coelogenys paca_) and cutia\r\n  (_Dasyprocta aguti_), all amphibious and having an extensive range.\r\n  Tapirs are to be found in the eastern forests, the peccary in more\r\n  open woodlands, and the opossum in nearly every part of the country.\r\n  Cattle, horses, asses, sheep and swine were introduced by the\r\n  Spaniards, and thrive well in some of the provinces. Excellent horses\r\n  are reared in the uplands, as well as mules and cattle, the pasturage\r\n  on the mountain slopes being good, and alfalfa being grown in\r\n  abundance in many districts. The Reptilia include countless numbers of\r\n  alligators in the Guayas and its tributaries and in the tide-water\r\n  channels of many of the smaller rivers; many species of lizards, of\r\n  which Mr Whymper found three in the Quito basin; snakes of every\r\n  description from the huge anaconda of the Amazon region down to the\r\n  beautifully marked coral snake; and a great variety of frogs and\r\n  toads. Bats also are very numerous, especially in the eastern forest\r\n  region, where the vampire bat is a serious obstacle to permanent\r\n  settlement. The avifauna of Ecuador is distinguished for the great\r\n  variety of its genera and species, among which are many peculiar to\r\n  the Amazon valley, and others to the colder uplands. Among the Amazon\r\n  species may be mentioned the parrot, macaw (_Macrocercus_), toucan\r\n  (_Ramphastos_), curassow (_Crax_), penelope, trogon, and horned\r\n  screamer (_Palamedea cornuta_). There are also herons, ibises, storks\r\n  and cranes, including the great black-headed white crane, _Mycteria\r\n  americana_, which ranges from northern Argentina to Colombia. One\r\n  species of ibis, the _Theristicus caudatus_, is to be found, it is\r\n  said, only on the slopes of Antisana. Species of the pheasant and\r\n  partridge are not uncommon, and the \"guacharo\" (_Steatornis\r\n  caripensis_), once believed to inhabit Venezuela only, is found in\r\n  Ecuador also. The Raptores are well represented by a large number of\r\n  genera and species, which include the condor, eagle, vulture, falcon,\r\n  hawk and owl. The condor (_Sarcorhamphus gryphus_) is commonly found\r\n  between the elevations of 6000 and 16,000 ft., rarely, if ever,\r\n  descending to the lowland plains or rising above the lower peaks. It\r\n  preys upon the smaller animals and inflicts much loss upon stock\r\n  farmers through the destruction of calves, lambs, &c., but it very\r\n  rarely ventures to attack man or any of the larger animals. The eagle\r\n  common to Ecuador is the _Morphnus taeniatus_, and possibly the _M.\r\n  guaianensis_ on the eastern slopes of the Andes. The harrier-eagle\r\n  (_Herpetotheres cachinnans_) is also to be found throughout this part\r\n  of the continent. An eagle with buzzard-like habits, the _Leucopternis\r\n  plumbea_, is likewise common in Ecuador. Among the vultures the\r\n  turkey-buzzard group (_Rhinogryphus_ or _Cathartes_), including the\r\n  _R. aurus_, _burrovianus_ and _perniger_, is common everywhere. The\r\n  carrion crow, or black vulture (_Catharista atrata_), is also common\r\n  to every part of the country, and is the general scavenger. The\r\n  carrion hawks are represented by the _Polyborus tharus_, popularly\r\n  called the \"caracara,\" and the _Phalcobaenus carunculatus_; the\r\n  falcons by the _Aesalon columbarius_; and the kites by the _Gampsonyx\r\n  swainsoni_. The Ecuadorean owl is the _Bubo nigrescens_. An\r\n  interesting species of the song birds is popularly known as the\r\n  \"flautero\" (flute-bird), which inhabits the eastern forests. Its notes\r\n  are marvellous imitations of \"the most mellow, sweet-sounding flute,\"\r\n  but the singer itself, according to Mr Simson, is \"a very\r\n  insignificant-looking little, greyish-coloured bird,\" which \"always\r\n  dies in captivity.\" The most interesting group of the smaller birds is\r\n  that of the hummingbirds, of which the number and variety is\r\n  astonishing. Some of these have a very wide range, while others are\r\n  apparently limited to a small district, or to a certain altitude. The\r\n  best-known fish of Ecuador is the insignificant _Pimelodus cyclopum_,\r\n  the only fish found in the streams and lakes of the plateau region.\r\n  Its fame rests on Humboldt's publication of the tradition that great\r\n  numbers of this tiny fish had been thrown out during the eruptions of\r\n  Imbabura and other volcanoes. Mr Whymper's explanation of the\r\n  phenomenon is that the fish are scattered over the land by the sudden\r\n  overflow during volcanic eruptions of the rivers and lakes which they\r\n  inhabit. The rivers of the eastern plains are probably stocked with\r\n  the fish found in the Amazon. On the coast, the Ancon de Sardinas bay\r\n  is so named from the multitude of small fish (_sardinas_) which\r\n  inhabit its waters. Elsewhere there are no fisheries of importance,\r\n  except those of the Galapagos Islands.\r\n\r\n  The insect inhabitants of Ecuador, like the birds, include a large\r\n  number of genera and species, but no complete entomological survey of\r\n  the country has ever been made, and our knowledge in this respect is\r\n  insufficient to warrant a detailed description. In one ascent of\r\n  Pichincha in 1880, Mr Whymper collected 21 species of beetles, all new\r\n  to science, between 12,000 and 15,600 ft. elevation. On Cotopaxi, at\r\n  elevations of 13,000 to 15,800 ft., 18 species of the genus _Colpodes_\r\n  were collected, of which 16 were new. This may be considered a fair\r\n  illustration of the situation in Ecuador so far as natural history\r\n  exploration is concerned. Of the Machachi basin, near Quito, which he\r\n  calls a \"zoologist's paradise,\" Mr Whymper writes (_Travels amongst\r\n  the Great Andes of the Equator_): \"Butterflies above, below and\r\n  around; now here, now there, by many turns and twists displaying the\r\n  brilliant tessellation of their under-sides ... May-flies and\r\n  dragon-flies danced in the sunlight; lizards darted across the paths;\r\n  and legions of spiders pervaded the grass, many very\r\n  beautiful--frosted--silver backs, or curious, like the saltigrades,\r\n  who took a few steps and then gave a leap. There were crickets in\r\n  infinite numbers; and flies innumerable, from slim daddy-long-legs to\r\n  ponderous, black, hairy fellows known to science as _Dejeaniae_;\r\n  hymenopterous insects in profusion, including our old friend the\r\n  bishop of Ambato (possibly _Dielis_), in company with another\r\n  formidable stinger, with chrome antennae, called by the natives 'the\r\n  Devil'; and occasional _Phasmas_ (caballo de palo) crawling painfully\r\n  about, like animated twigs.\" This description refers to a fertile\r\n  sub-tropical oasis on the partially barren plateau; below in the\r\n  forested lowlands, where tropical conditions prevail, the numbers and\r\n  varieties are many times greater. The Coleoptera are especially\r\n  numerous; Mr Whymper took home with him 206 species which had been\r\n  identified and described up to 1892, most of them from the uplands and\r\n  most of them new to science. The total number of species in Ecuador is\r\n  roughly estimated to be 8000. The Hymenoptera are also numerous, but\r\n  less so than the Lepidoptera, with which the mountain slopes and\r\n  sunny, open spaces seem to be literally covered. Of moths alone Mr\r\n  Whymper took away with him specimens representing no less than 23\r\n  genera, with a probable addition of 13 genera more among his\r\n  undescribed specimens, the largest of which (an _Erebus odora_) was\r\n  7-1/4 in. across the wings. Among the Diptera, which includes a very\r\n  wide range of genera and species, are some of a highly troublesome\r\n  character, though on the whole, Mr Whymper did not find the flies and\r\n  mosquitoes so. His explorations, however, did not extend to the\r\n  eastern region, where the mosquitoes are usually described by\r\n  travellers as extremely troublesome. Sand-flies are common, and in the\r\n  eastern forests the tiny _pium_ fly (_Trombidium_, sp.?) is a\r\n  veritable pest. Of the insects which infest dwellings and prey upon\r\n  their human inmates, such as fleas, bed-bugs, roaches, &c., Ecuador\r\n  has more than a bountiful supply. Lice-eating is a widely prevalent\r\n  habit among the Indians and mestizos, and demonstrates how numerous\r\n  these parasites are among the people. A good illustration of the\r\n  prevalence of house-infesting animals and insects is given by Mr\r\n  Whymper (_op. cit._ p. 391), who made a collection of 50 different\r\n  specimens of the vermin which infested his bedroom in Guayaquil.\r\n\r\n_Population._--The indigenous population of Ecuador was originally\r\ncomposed of two distinct races--the Quitus and Caras, the former being\r\nthe older, and the latter presumably of Quichua origin. The Caras,\r\naccording to tradition, entered the country from the coast, and had\r\nthoroughly established themselves there long before the conquest by the\r\nInca rulers Tupac-Yupanqui and his son Huayna-Capac. This conquest was\r\ncomparatively easy because the Caras spoke a dialect of the same\r\nlanguage, and were not greatly unlike their conquerors in manners and\r\ncustoms. The present Indian population of Ecuador, excepting those of\r\nthe trans-Andean region, may be considered as descendants of these two\r\nraces. They are subjected to incredible abuses under Spanish colonial\r\nrule, their numbers being reduced to a fraction of the former\r\npopulation, and even yet they are subjected to a kind of debt-bondage\r\nwhich is slavery in all but the name. Notwithstanding all this they\r\nstill represent from two-thirds to three-fourths of the actual\r\npopulation of Ecuador. East of the Andes the forests are inhabited by\r\ntribes of what are termed \"aucas\" or \"infieles\" (infidels)--Indians who\r\nare independent of both church and political control. Missions have been\r\nestablished among some of the tribes, but their influence reaches only a\r\nsmall part of the wild inhabitants of this extensive region.\r\n\r\nThe principal tribes are the Quijos or Canelos, who are settled about\r\nthe headwaters of the Napo, on the eastern slopes of the Andes, and are\r\nin great part grouped about the missions; the Jivaros who inhabit the\r\nvalley of the Pastaza; the Zaparos who occupy the forest region between\r\nthe Pastaza and Napo; the Piojes of the middle Napo, and eastward to the\r\nPutumayo; and the Iquitos and Mazanes of the lower Napo and Tigre,\r\nchiefly in territory occupied by Peru. The Jivaros are the best known of\r\nthese tribes because of their successful resistance to the Spanish\r\ninvaders. They are still independent of political control, live in\r\npermanent settlements, till the soil (producing Indian corn, beans,\r\nyucca and plantains), and have developed some rude manufactures. The\r\nZaparos are less homogeneous, some of their hordes living in a state of\r\ncomplete savagery. They are classified with the Guaranis of Brazil, whom\r\nthey resemble in many particulars. The Piojes live in permanent\r\ncommunities and cultivate the soil. The total number of \"aucas\" or\r\nuncivilized Indians in the republic has been estimated at about 200,000,\r\nbut this estimate covered a larger area than Ecuador actually occupies\r\nand is evidently too high. Their settlements are usually small and very\r\nmuch scattered, and their aggregate number is evidently much under the\r\nearlier estimates. An official estimate given to Mr Whymper in 1880,\r\nhowever, places the population of Oriente (the eastern territory) at\r\n80,000, which is probably more nearly correct.\r\n\r\nNo general census has ever been taken in Ecuador, and estimates are\r\nlittle better than vague conjectures. One of these estimates, that\r\npublished by P.F. Cevallos for 1889, which has been generally accepted,\r\ngave the total population as 1,272,161, and these figures have been used\r\nwith but slight changes for various later estimates. A later official\r\nestimate appeared in 1900 in _La Republique de l'Equateur et sa\r\nparticipation a l'Exposition Universelle de 1900_, which gives for the\r\nprovinces practically the same figures as those of Cevallos, and at the\r\nsame time assumes the total for the whole republic to be 1,500,000. The\r\nwhite population is estimated at 100,000 to 120,000, which probably\r\nincludes many of mixed ancestry, and the mixed bloods at 300,000 to\r\n450,000. The tendency is for the _mestizo_ who dwells in Indian\r\ncommunities to revert to the Indian type, and it is probable that the\r\nlarger estimate is nearer the truth. On the other hand _mestizos_ who\r\nlive among the whites and form new alliances with them eventually class\r\nthemselves as whites wherever their social condition has been improved.\r\nAs a rule, the _mestizos_ of Ecuador are ignorant, indolent and\r\nnon-progressive. As in Colombia they are the artizans and small traders\r\nand the Indians are the farm labourers. The land is held by a few\r\nproprietors, and caste sentiment is strong among those who claim unmixed\r\nEuropean descent; consequently the _mestizos_ have limited opportunities\r\nto improve their condition.\r\n\r\nThe whites form an exclusive governing caste, as in Chile. The territory\r\nof the republic is divided among a very few of them, and its government\r\nis in their hands.\r\n\r\nIn the hot seaboard districts there are a small number of negroes, and a\r\nsomewhat larger number of their crosses with the other two races. The\r\nmajority of these are to be found in the northern provinces. There are\r\ncomparatively few negroes and mulattoes on the colder plateaus.\r\nVillavicencio estimated their numbers at 7831 pure negroes and 36,592\r\nmixed bloods, which is probably not far from the correct totals.\r\n\r\nThe foreign population is small, the total being estimated at about\r\n6000, of which 5000 are natives of the neighbouring Latin republics, 700\r\nEuropeans and Americans, and 300 Chinese.\r\n\r\n_Territorial Divisions and Towns._--The republic is divided into 15\r\nprovinces and one territory. The Galapagos Islands were declared a\r\ndependency of the province of Guayas in 1885, but are practically\r\nindependent and constitute a second territory under the administration\r\nof _jefe territorial_ appointed by the national executive.\r\n\r\n  The official estimate (_La Republique de l'Equateur et sa\r\n  participation a l'Exposition Universelle de 1900_) gives the data for\r\n  the provinces and their capitals, which are shown on the next page.\r\n\r\n  These population figures are very nearly the same as those given by\r\n  Cevallos for 1889. If the population of the Oriente be taken as\r\n  80,000, the aggretate is very nearly the same. The population of the\r\n  provincial capitals is in some cases over-estimated, especially for\r\n  Guayaquil and Quito, neither of which could have had 50,000 at the\r\n  date of this estimate. The population of Quito in May 1906 was 50,841,\r\n  of which 1365 were foreigners. As for the areas of the provinces the\r\n  figures need not be questioned except those for the Oriente territory,\r\n  which are much too large for the region actually occupied by Ecuador,\r\n  and for the Galapagos Islands which are described by competent\r\n  authorities as 2400 sq. m. The population of these islands was 400\r\n  (principally convicts) on Chatham Island in 1901, about 115 on\r\n  Albemarle and 3 on Charles Island in 1903. Besides the provincial\r\n  capitals already noted, there are no large and important towns in the\r\n  country. The largest of the smaller towns is probably Jipijapa, in the\r\n  province of Manabi, which is the centre of the Panama hat industry and\r\n  had in 1900 an estimated population of 6000, nearly all Indians.\r\n\r\n    +----------------+---------+-----------+------------+-----------+\r\n    |   Provinces.   |  Area.  |Population.|  Capital.  |Population.|\r\n    +----------------+---------+-----------+------------+-----------+\r\n    |                | sq. m.  |           |            |           |\r\n    | Carchi         |  1495   |   40,000  | Tulcan     |   5,000   |\r\n    | Imbabura       |  2416   |   68,000  | Ibarra     |   5,000   |\r\n    | Pichincha      |  6219   |  205,000  | Quito      |  80,000   |\r\n    | Leon           |  2595   |  109,600  | Latacunga  |  12,000   |\r\n    | Tunguragua     |  1686   |  103,000  | Ambato     |   8,000   |\r\n    | Chimborazo     |  2990   |  122,000  | Riobamba   |  12,000   |\r\n    | Bolivar        |  1260   |   43,000  | Guaranda   |   6,000   |\r\n    | Canar          |  1519   |   64,000  | Azogues    |   4,000   |\r\n    | Azuay          |  3874   |  132,400  | Cuenca     |  30,000   |\r\n    | Loja           |  3707   |   66,000  | Loja       |  10,000   |\r\n    | El Oro         |  2340   |   32,600  | Machala    |   3,200   |\r\n    | Guayas         |  8216   |   98,100  | Guayaquil  |  60,000   |\r\n    | Los Rios       |  2296   |   32,800  | Babahoyo   |   3,000   |\r\n    | Manabi         |  7893   |   64,100  | Portoviejo |   5,000   |\r\n    | Esmeraldas     |  5465   |   14,600  | Esmeraldas |   6,000   |\r\n    | Oriente (ter.) | unknown |           |            |           |\r\n    | Galapagos Is.  |  2865   |    2,000  |    . .     |    . .    |\r\n    +----------------+---------+-----------+------------+-----------+\r\n\r\n  _Communications._--The first railway to be completed in Ecuador was\r\n  the line between Guayaquil and Quito, 290 m. in length, the last\r\n  section of which was formally opened at Quito on the 25th of June\r\n  1908. It belongs to an American company, and had been under\r\n  construction for many years. Lines from Puerto Bolivar to Machala,\r\n  province of El Oro, and another from Bahia de Caraquez to Chone, were\r\n  under construction in 1908. Several lines were also projected, two to\r\n  penetrate the Ecuadorean _montana_. There is only one highway in the\r\n  country on which vehicles can be used, the paved road extending\r\n  southward from Quito 115 m. on the Guayaquil route, which was begun by\r\n  Garcia Moreno but has been allowed to fall into neglect. Other roads\r\n  have been projected to the coast and one to the eastern territory. The\r\n  ordinary roads are rough mule-tracks. These are difficult at all\r\n  times, and in the rainy season are quite impassable. On the Pacific\r\n  lowlands the rivers Guayas, Daule, Vinces and Yaguachi have about 200\r\n  m. of navigable channels in the rainy season, and are used for the\r\n  transportation of produce and merchandise. There are also several\r\n  short river channels along the coast which are used by planters for\r\n  the same purpose. A great part of the country, however, is still\r\n  compelled to use the most primitive means of communication--mule\r\n  paths, fords in the smaller streams in the dry season, and rude\r\n  suspension bridges across deep gorges and swift mountain torrents. The\r\n  latter are usually constructed from the tough fibre of the _Agave\r\n  americana_ and consist of one or more cables. When of one cable,\r\n  called the _taravita_, the passenger and his luggage are drawn across\r\n  in a rude kind of basket suspended from it; but when two or more\r\n  cables are used, transverse sticks of bamboo and reeds are laid upon\r\n  them, forming a rude prototype of the regular suspension bridge. Such\r\n  a bridge is called a _chimba-chaca_, and is very hazardous for an\r\n  unpractised foot. In 1907 there were 2564 m. of telegraph lines in\r\n  operation, connecting Quito with all the principal towns. The national\r\n  capital is connected with the submarine cable at Santa Elena (via\r\n  Guayaquil) and at Tumaco, in Colombia. Guayaquil is provided with\r\n  tramway and telephone lines. These public services are under the\r\n  general supervision of the Minister of Public Instruction, Posts and\r\n  Telegraphs.\r\n\r\n  _Commerce._--Ecuador has no merchant marine beyond a few small vessels\r\n  engaged in the coastwise traffic, some eighteen or twenty river\r\n  steamers on the Guayas and its tributaries, and a number of steam\r\n  launches, towboats and various descriptions of barges engaged in the\r\n  transportation of produce and goods on the rivers. The ocean-going\r\n  foreign trade of the country is carried wholly in foreign vessels, for\r\n  the regular lines of which Guayaquil is a principal port of call. Less\r\n  frequent calls are made at Esmeraldas and some of the other small\r\n  ports on the coast, of which there are nine in all. Most of these are\r\n  difficult of access and their trade is unimportant. The total trade of\r\n  the republic in 1905, according to returns published by the Guayaquil\r\n  Chamber of Commerce, amounted to only L3,429,955, of which L1,573,389\r\n  (15,733,891 sucres) were credited to imports, and L1,856,566\r\n  (18,565,668 sucres) to exports. Of these totals, all but L127,532 of\r\n  the imports and L441,679 of the exports passed through the port of\r\n  Guayaquil. The great poverty of the people has been a serious obstacle\r\n  to the development of a larger commerce.\r\n\r\n  _Agriculture._--The agricultural industries on which the export trade\r\n  depends are almost wholly restricted to the western lowlands, and\r\n  include cacao, coffee, cotton, sugar, tobacco, rice, yucca and sweet\r\n  potatoes. The Guayas basin and the district about Machala are\r\n  celebrated for their cacao, and produce about one-third of the world's\r\n  supply. It is the staple product of the country. Coffee is produced\r\n  on the lower slopes of the Cordilleras and is of excellent quality.\r\n  The production is small, but would be increased at remunerative\r\n  prices. During the American civil war the planters of Ecuador entered\r\n  largely into the production of cotton, which at that time yielded\r\n  large profits, but the industry has declined to very insignificant\r\n  proportions since then because of inability to compete with the lower\r\n  cost of production in the United States. The output of sugar and\r\n  tobacco is small, but could be largely increased, as the conditions of\r\n  soil and climate are favourable. Much of the sugar-cane produced is\r\n  turned into rum, which is consumed in the country. The tobacco grown\r\n  is of excellent quality. Efforts have been made to promote the\r\n  cultivation of indigo, but without much success. On the uplands,\r\n  wheat, Indian corn, oats, barley, potatoes and vegetables of many\r\n  kinds are successfully cultivated, but wholly for home consumption.\r\n  The vine is successfully grown in the warm upland valleys, both for\r\n  its fruit and for the production of wine. The staple foods for the\r\n  common people are potatoes on the plateau (which are chiefly consumed\r\n  in the form of _locro_, or potato-soup) and yucca- or cassava-meal in\r\n  the warmer regions. Although cattle and horses were not known before\r\n  the Spanish conquest, they have become since then important products\r\n  of the country. The best grazing lands are on the lower elevations\r\n  west of the Cordilleras in certain districts of the plateau and on the\r\n  slopes of some of the higher Andes, as on Chimborazo and Antisana.\r\n  Horses and mules are reared for export on a small scale, and sheep for\r\n  their wool, which is used in home manufactures.\r\n\r\n  _Forest Products._--The forest and other natural products include\r\n  rubber, cinchona bark, ivory-nuts, mocora and toquilla fibre for the\r\n  manufacture of hats, hammocks, &c., cabaya fibre for shoes and\r\n  cordage, vegetable wool (_Bombax ceiba_), sarsaparilla, vanilla,\r\n  cochineal, cabinet woods, fruit, resins, &c. The original source of\r\n  the Peruvian bark of commerce, the _Cinchona calisaya_, is completely\r\n  exhausted, and the \"red bark\" derived from _C. succirubra_, is now the\r\n  principal source of supply from Ecuador. Guaranda is the centre of the\r\n  industry, but bark gatherers are to be found everywhere in the forest\r\n  regions. The rubber-gathering industry is comparatively new. The\r\n  product is derived from the _Castilloa elastica_, the _Heveas_ not\r\n  being found west of the Andes.\r\n\r\n  _Minerals._--The mineral resources are much inferior to those of\r\n  Colombia and Peru. Gold is found in the province of El Oro, where the\r\n  great Zaruma and other companies have opened a number of mines. It is\r\n  also found in the provinces of Loja, Esmeraldas, and in the river-beds\r\n  along the eastern slopes of the Andes. Quicksilver has been mined at\r\n  Azogues, in the province of Canar, and is also to be found in Azuay.\r\n  Iron ores and lead are credited to several provinces, and platinum has\r\n  been found in Esmeraldas, where emerald mines have been worked ever\r\n  since the Spanish conquest. Coal of good quality has been found in\r\n  Azuay and at other points, and petroleum is known to exist in several\r\n  localities. Salt springs near Riobamba and at Salinas, in Imbabura,\r\n  have long been used by the natives in the manufacture of salt.\r\n\r\n  _Manufactures._--The manufacturing industries are chiefly of a\r\n  primitive character and have been developed to meet local necessities.\r\n  There are some cotton factories and sugar mills provided with modern\r\n  machinery, but the cotton and woollen cloths of the country are\r\n  commonly coarse and manufactured in the most primitive manner. Some of\r\n  these goods are sent into southern Colombia, but they are chiefly made\r\n  for the local market. Hats and hammocks are made from the fibres of\r\n  the mocora and toquilla palms, and sandals from the fibre of the\r\n  _Agave americana_. The hats are an article of export, and are known\r\n  abroad as Panama hats. Hand-made laces of admirable workmanship are\r\n  made in some localities, especially on the plateau about Quito. Among\r\n  other manufactories, all for the home market, may be mentioned:\r\n  flour-mills, sugar refineries, rum distilleries, breweries, chocolate\r\n  factories, a candle factory, saw-mills and tanneries.\r\n\r\n_Government._--Constitutionally, the government of Ecuador is that of a\r\ncentralized republic, whose powers are defined by a written constitution\r\nand whose chief organs are an executive consisting of a president and\r\nvice-president, and a national congress consisting of two houses, a\r\nsenate and a chamber of deputies. Revolutionary changes, however, have\r\nbeen very frequent in Ecuador, and no less than eleven constitutions\r\nwere adopted between 1830 and 1909.\r\n\r\n  The constitution adopted in 1906 succeeded that of 1884 (amended in\r\n  1887 and 1897), and its terms may be given here, subject to what may\r\n  be regarded as the extra-constitutional powers vested in the\r\n  executive. Executive power is vested in a president and vice-president\r\n  elected for periods of four years by a direct vote of the people.\r\n  (Under the constitution of 1884 the official terms of these two\r\n  officers were not wholly synchronous, the vice-president's term\r\n  beginning with the president's third year.) These officials cannot be\r\n  re-elected to succeed themselves. The president, whose salary is\r\n  12,000 sucres per annum, has a limited veto power, and may convene\r\n  extraordinary sessions of Congress for a specified purpose, but he has\r\n  no further authority over that body. He appoints the diplomatic and\r\n  consular representatives of the republic and the governors of the\r\n  provinces, exercises a limited control over the administration of\r\n  justice and public instruction through the appointment of officials,\r\n  and is chief of the small military force maintained by the republic.\r\n  The construction of railways with public funds and under government\r\n  supervision also places him at the head of a very important public\r\n  service. The president is assisted by a cabinet of five\r\n  ministers:--foreign relations and justice; interior and public works;\r\n  finance; war; public instruction, posts and telegraphs--all of whom\r\n  may be impeached by congress. The executive authority is also\r\n  partially exercised by a council of state composed of 15 members,\r\n  including the five cabinet ministers, of which the vice-president is\r\n  _ex-officio_ president. The council has important advisory functions,\r\n  and must be consulted by the president on every important measure or\r\n  appointment. The provinces are administered by governors chosen by the\r\n  national executive; the departments by _jefes politicos_ (political\r\n  chiefs); and the municipalities by _tenientes politicos_ (political\r\n  lieutenants). The Galapagos Islands are under a _jefe territorial_\r\n  (territorial chief), Chatham Island being a penal colony and governed\r\n  by special laws.\r\n\r\n  The congressional organization is similar to that of the majority of\r\n  South American states. The senate is composed of 32 members (2 from\r\n  each province) elected for two years, one-half the number being\r\n  renewed each two years. The chamber is composed of 42 deputies, who\r\n  are elected by the provinces for a period of two years, on a basis of\r\n  one representative for each 30,000 inhabitants and one supplementary\r\n  representative for an additional 15,000. A senator must be at least 35\r\n  years of age, and a deputy 25. The elections are direct, and members\r\n  of both houses may be re-elected. The immunities of legislators begin\r\n  30 days before the opening session of congress, and terminate 30 days\r\n  after its dissolution. Congress meets at Quito on the 10th of August,\r\n  and remains in session for a period of 60 days, but its sessions may\r\n  be extended or extraordinary sessions called for specified purposes.\r\n  The right of suffrage is restricted to literate male adults.\r\n\r\n  The judicial branch of the government is composed of a supreme court,\r\n  located at Quito, consisting of 5 judges and a fiscal (public\r\n  prosecutor) appointed by the executive; six superior courts (in Quito,\r\n  Guayaquil, Cuenca, Riobamba, Loja and Portoviejo) with a total of 9\r\n  judges; _a Tribunal de Cuentas_ of seven members at Quito; and various\r\n  municipal courts, or _alcaldes_, in the chief towns of the\r\n  departments. There are civil courts of first and second instance in\r\n  the larger towns, and consular courts in Quito, Guayaquil and Cuenca\r\n  with jurisdiction in commercial cases. There are also police\r\n  commissaries in the departments and justices of the peace in the\r\n  municipalities, the latter having jurisdiction in civil cases where\r\n  the amount involved does not exceed 200 sucres. The laws of Ecuador\r\n  are based on the old Spanish laws and procedure, and include civil,\r\n  criminal and commercial codes.\r\n\r\n  _Army._--The army, according to an official report of 1900, consisted\r\n  of 4 battalions of infantry (about 3690 strong), 3 brigades of\r\n  artillery (1362), and 2 regiments of cavalry (468), in all, about 5520\r\n  men, rank and file. In 1908 this force was reported to comprise 4350\r\n  men. The national guard is composed of three classes: actives--all\r\n  enrolled citizens of 20 to 38 years; auxiliaries--enrolled citizens of\r\n  38 to 44 years; and passives--enrolled citizens of 44 to 50 years.\r\n  These were estimated at 95,329 men. There is a military school at\r\n  Quito and a naval school at Guayaquil.\r\n\r\n  _Education._--Although primary instruction is free, and is obligatory\r\n  for children of 6 to 12 years, a considerable part Of the population\r\n  is unprovided with schools and is indifferent in regard to them. An\r\n  official report for 1900 gives the number of primary schools as 1297,\r\n  and the number of pupils in attendance as about 80,000. The secondary\r\n  schools numbered 37, with 371 teachers and about 4500 pupils. Higher\r\n  instruction includes the technical and professional schools with the\r\n  three universities of Quito, Guayaquil and Cuenca, and 6 schools of\r\n  \"trades and professions\" (_artes y oficios_) in as many provinces. The\r\n  old University of Quito has a staff of 32 professors divided into 5\r\n  faculties: Philosophy and Belles-Lettres, Law, Medicine, Physical and\r\n  Natural Sciences and Mathematics. There are also in Quito a school of\r\n  agriculture, astronomical observatory, botanical garden, museum and\r\n  national printing office, all apparently under the supervision of the\r\n  University.\r\n\r\n  _Church._--According to the constitution of 1884, \"the religion of the\r\n  Republic is the Roman Catholic Apostolic, and all others are\r\n  excluded.\" The only opposition which the Church has ever had to\r\n  encounter has been from the \"liberal\" element within itself, and thus\r\n  has arisen, seemingly from political motives, a desire to restrict\r\n  clerical influence in political affairs. This influence has been\r\n  exercised to an extreme in Ecuador, so much so, in fact, that its\r\n  government at times was more nearly a theocracy than a republic. The\r\n  growth of liberalism finally began to produce results. In 1889 the\r\n  tithes from which the Church revenues had been derived were abolished,\r\n  and a tax of 3 per mil. on real estate was substituted. In 1902 a\r\n  signal victory was won in a law permitting civil marriage, but in 1904\r\n  a social revolution was effected by legislation, which placed the\r\n  Church under State control, forbade the foundation of new religious\r\n  orders and admission into the country of new religious communities,\r\n  and provided that the members of the episcopate must be citizens of\r\n  Ecuador. The higher dignitaries of the Church are an archbishop at\r\n  Quito, and six suffragan bishops at Cuenca, Loja, Ibarra, Riobamba,\r\n  Guayaquil and Manabi.\r\n\r\n  _Finance._--The revenues of the republic are derived from import and\r\n  export duties, liquor, tobacco and stamp taxes, inheritance tax, salt,\r\n  gunpowder and playing cards monopolies, consular charges, and sundry\r\n  miscellaneous receipts, including those from posts, telegraphs and\r\n  railways. Up to 1907 the customs duties were increased by surtaxes\r\n  amounting at that time to 100%. The minister of finance proposed to\r\n  abolish these surtaxes and double all the rates of duties involved. On\r\n  exports, however, all the duties were to be abolished except those on\r\n  cacao, coffee, hides, rubber, tagua (ivory nuts), hat fibre, hammock\r\n  fibre and tobacco. For 1907 the revenues were L1,424,770 and the\r\n  expenditures L1,383,122.\r\n\r\n  On the 10th of October 1906, when the report of the provisional\r\n  government created by the revolution of the preceding January\r\n  presented its financial report to a national assembly, the total\r\n  obligations of the country were stated to be:--\r\n\r\n                                             Sucres.\r\n    Railway bonds, 12,282,000 sucres gold\r\n      at 107% premium                      25,423,740\r\n    Banco del Ecuador, advances             3,000,000\r\n    Banco Comercial y Agrocola, idem        2,400,000\r\n    Internal debt                             739,575\r\n    Condor bonds                              757,000\r\n    French Finance Corporation                887,000\r\n                                            ---------\r\n                             Total         33,207,315\r\n        In L sterling at 10 sucres per L    3,320,731\r\n\r\n  The foreign debt of the republic, which in 1898 stood at L693,160 in\r\n  bonds, was assumed by the Guayaquil & Quito Railway Co. under\r\n  contracts of 1897, 1898, 1899 and 1900, the government guaranteeing\r\n  interest on the sum of L2,520,000 railway mortgage bonds for 33 years\r\n  and recognizing the external debt at 35% of its face value. This debt\r\n  originated in 1830, when Ecuador seceded from the Colombian\r\n  confederacy and was charged with 21-1/2% of the indebtedness of the\r\n  three states. In 1855 the amount was fixed at L1,824,000, and in 1892\r\n  it was converted into a new consolidated debt of L750,000. Payments of\r\n  interest and amortization had been very irregular, and its transfer to\r\n  a foreign company as the price of a railway concession put an end to a\r\n  transaction which had been a serious discredit to the country. The\r\n  amount outstanding on the 31st of December 1907 was 10,808,000 sucres\r\n  (L1,080,800). It should be said that the difficulties in regard to\r\n  this debt arose from a feeling in Ecuador that the part assigned to it\r\n  in 1830 was much too large, and that it was contracted almost wholly\r\n  for the benefit of the two northern republics, Colombia and Venezuela.\r\n\r\n  _Money and Measures._--Under the law of 1898, which came into effect\r\n  on the 4th of June 1900, gold is made the monetary standard in\r\n  Ecuador, the legal tender of silver being limited to 10 sucres, and\r\n  banks of issue being required to hold at least one-half their metallic\r\n  reserves in gold coin. Previously there had been much confusion in the\r\n  circulating medium because of the depreciated value of the Quito\r\n  currency in comparison with that of Guayaquil, but the new law has\r\n  corrected the anomaly and has given a simple and uniform medium for\r\n  the whole country. The coinage under the law of 1898 consists of the\r\n  gold _condor_, of 10 _sucres_, which weighs 8.136 grams, contains\r\n  7.3224 grams of fine gold, and is equal to the English pound sterling\r\n  in value; the silver _sucre_, of 100 centavos, equivalent to 24d. in\r\n  value; and smaller coins of silver, nickel and copper, the\r\n  denominations being decimal parts of the sucre. The sucre received its\r\n  name from the portrait of General Sucre engraved on the coin, and is\r\n  legal tender up to 10 sucres. The paper money circulation consists of\r\n  the issues of two Guayaquil banks--the Banco del Ecuador, and the\r\n  Banco Comercial y Agricola, whose united issues on June 30th, 1906,\r\n  amounted to 7,414,140 sucres (L741,414). The Bank of Quito at one time\r\n  issued notes which, according to Whymper, were not current at and\r\n  south of Riobamba, but it does not appear that this bank is authorized\r\n  to issue its notes under the new law. The metallic money nominally in\r\n  circulation on the 30th of June 1906, amounted to 2,587,667 sucres\r\n  gold and 2,522,802 sucres silver. Although the metric system was\r\n  adopted in 1856, the old Spanish weights and measures--the quintal,\r\n  libra, vara and fanega--are still in use, the quintal being equivalent\r\n  to about 101 lb.\r\n\r\n  _Antiquities._--Throughout Ecuador there are still considerable\r\n  remains of the architectural and artistic skill of the ante-European\r\n  period. At Canar, to the north-east of Cuenca, stands the Incapirca, a\r\n  circular rampart of finely hewn stone, enclosing an open area with a\r\n  roofless but well-preserved building in the centre; not far off is the\r\n  Inca-chungana, a very much smaller enclosure, probably the remains of\r\n  a pavilion; and in the same neighbourhood the image of the sun and a\r\n  small cabinet are carved on the face of a rock called Intihuaicu. On\r\n  one of the hills running from Pichincha to the Esmeraldas there are\r\n  remains at Paltatamba of a temple and a conical tower, the buttresses\r\n  of a bridge composed of stone and bitumen, portions of a great\r\n  causeway, and numerous tombs from which mummies and plates of silver\r\n  have been obtained. At Hantuntaqui similar sepulchral mounds, called\r\n  _tolas_, may be seen, as well as traces of military structures. On the\r\n  plain of Callo, near Cotopaxi, at a height of 8658 ft., the ruins of\r\n  an Incarial palace, Pachusala, are utilized by the _hacienda_; and a\r\n  conical hill at its side is supposed to be of artificial\r\n  construction. The remains of another fortress and palace are preserved\r\n  at Pomallacta, and in the neighbouring pueblo of Achupallas an ancient\r\n  temple of the sun now serves as parish church. In many localities,\r\n  especially in Imbabura, pottery and various objects are found\r\n  belonging to the pre-Colombian period, among which five and six rayed\r\n  stars (_casse-tetes_) are very numerous. (A. J. L.)\r\n\r\n_History._--The territory of the republic of Ecuador, when first it\r\nbecomes dimly visible in the grey dawn of American history, appears to\r\nbe inhabited by upwards of fifty independent tribes, among which the\r\nQuitus seem to hold the most important position. About A.D. 280 a\r\nforeign tribe is said to have forced their way inland up the valley of\r\nthe Esmeraldas; and the kingdom which they founded at Quito lasted for\r\nabout 1200 years, and was gradually extended, both by war and alliance,\r\nover many of the neighbouring dominions. In 1460, during the reign of\r\nthe fourteenth _Caran Shyri_, or king of the Cara nation, Hualcopo\r\nDuchisela, the conquest of Quito was undertaken by Tupac Yupanqui, the\r\nInca of Peru; and his ambitious schemes were, not long after his death,\r\nsuccessfully carried out by his son Huayna-Capac, who inflicted a\r\ndecisive defeat on the Quitonians in the battle of Hatuntaqui, and\r\nsecured his position by marrying Pacha, the daughter of the late Shyri.\r\nBy his will the conqueror left the kingdom of Quito to Atahuallpa, his\r\nson by this alliance; while the Peruvian throne was assigned to Huascar,\r\nan elder son by his Peruvian consort. War soon broke out between the two\r\nkingdoms, owing to Huascar's pretensions to supremacy over his brother;\r\nbut it ended in the defeat and imprisonment of the usurper, and the\r\nestablishment of Atahuallpa as master both of Quito and Cuzco. The\r\nfortunate monarch, however, had not long to enjoy his success; for\r\nPizarro and his Spaniards were already at the door, and by 1533 the fate\r\nof the country was sealed. As soon as the confusions and rivalries of\r\nthe first occupation were suppressed, the recent kingdom of Quito was\r\nmade a presidency of the Spanish viceroyalty of Peru, and no change of\r\nimportance took place till 1710. In that year it was attached to the\r\nviceroyalty of Santa Fe; but it was restored to Peru in 1722. When,\r\ntowards the close of the century, the desire for independence began to\r\nmanifest itself throughout the Spanish colonies of South America, Quito\r\ndid not remain altogether indifferent. The Quitonian doctor Eugenio\r\nEspejo, and his fellow-citizen Don Juan Pio Montufar, entered into\r\nhearty co-operation with Narino and Zea, the leaders of the\r\nrevolutionary movement at Santa Fe; and it was at Espejo's suggestion\r\nthat the political association called the _Escuela de Concordia_ was\r\ninstituted at Quito. It was not till 1809, however, that the Quitonians\r\nmade a real attempt to throw off the Spanish yoke; and both on that\r\noccasion and in 1812 the royal general succeeded in crushing the\r\ninsurrection. In 1820 the people of Guayaquil took up the cry of\r\nliberty; and in spite of several defeats they continued the contest,\r\ntill at length, under Antonio Jose de Sucre, who had been sent to their\r\nassistance by Bolivar, and reinforced by a Peruvian contingent under\r\nAndres de Santa Cruz, they gained a complete victory on May 22, 1822, in\r\na battle fought on the side of Mount Pichincha, at a height of 10,200\r\nft. above the sea. Two days after, the Spanish president of Quito, Don\r\nMelchor de Aymeric, capitulated, and the independence of the country was\r\nsecured. A political union was at once effected with New Granada and\r\nVenezuela on the basis of the republican constitution instituted at\r\nCucuta in July 1821--the triple confederation taking the name of\r\nColombia.\r\n\r\nA disagreement with Peru in 1828 resulted in the invasion of Ecuador and\r\nthe temporary occupation of Cuenca and Guayaquil by Peruvian forces; but\r\npeace was restored in the following year after the Ecuadorian victory at\r\nTarqui. In the early part of 1830 a separation was effected from the\r\nColombian federation, and the country was proclaimed an independent\r\nrepublic. General Juan Jose Flores was the first president, and in spite\r\nof many difficulties, both domestic and foreign, he managed to maintain\r\na powerful position in the state for about 15 years. Succeeded in 1835\r\nby Vicente Rocafuerte, he regained the presidency in 1839, and was\r\nelected for the third time in 1843; but shortly afterwards he accepted\r\nthe title of generalissimo and a sum of 20,000 pesos, and left the\r\ncountry to his rivals. One of the most important measures of his second\r\npresidency was the establishment of peace and friendship with Spain.\r\nRoca, who next attained to power, effected a temporary settlement with\r\nColombia, concluded a convention with England against the slave trade,\r\nand made a commercial treaty with Belgium. Diego Noboa, elected in 1850\r\nafter a period of great confusion, recalled the Jesuits, produced a\r\nrupture with New Granada by receiving conservative refugees, and thus\r\nbrought about his own deposition and exile. The democratic Urbina now\r\nbecame practically dictator, and as the attempt of Flores to reinstate\r\nNoboa proved a total failure, he was quickly succeeded in 1856 by\r\nGeneral Francisco Robles, who, among other progressive measures, secured\r\nthe adoption of the French system of coinage, weights and measures. He\r\nabdicated in 1859 and left the country, after refusing to ratify the\r\ntreaty with Peru, by which the defender of Guayaquil had obtained the\r\nraising of the siege. Dr Gabriel Garcia Moreno, professor of chemistry,\r\nthe recognized leader of the conservative party at Quito, was ultimately\r\nelected by the national convention of 1861. Distrust in his policy,\r\nhowever, was excited by the publication of some of his private\r\ncorrespondence, in which he spoke favourably of a French protectorate,\r\nand the army which he sent under Flores to resist the encroachments of\r\nMosquera, the president of New Granada, was completely routed. His first\r\nresignation in 1864 was refused; but the despotic acts by which he\r\nsought to establish a dictatorship only embittered his opponents, and in\r\nSeptember 1865 he retired from office. While he had endeavoured to\r\ndevelop the material resources of the country, he had at the same time\r\nintroduced retrograde measures in regard to religion and education. The\r\nprincipal event in the short presidency of his successor, Geronimo\r\nCarrion (May 1865-Nov. 1867), was the alliance with Chile and Peru\r\nagainst Spain, and the banishment of all Spanish subjects. Several\r\nimportant changes were made by congress in the period between his\r\nresignation and the election of Xavier Espinosa, January 1868: the power\r\nof the president to imprison persons regarded as dangerous to public\r\norder was annulled; and the immediate naturalization of Bolivians,\r\nChilians, Peruvians and Colombians was authorized. Espinosa had hardly\r\nentered on his office when, in August 1868, the country was visited by\r\nan earthquake, in which 30,000 people are said to have perished\r\nthroughout South America. The public buildings of Quito were laid in\r\nruins; and Ibarra, Otavalo, Cotacachi and several other towns were\r\ncompletely destroyed. Next year a revolution at Quito, under Moreno,\r\nbrought Espinosa's presidency to a close; and though the national\r\nconvention appointed Carvajal to the vacant office, Moreno succeeded in\r\nsecuring his own election in 1870 for a term of six years. His policy\r\nhad undergone no alteration since 1865: the same persistent endeavour\r\nwas made to establish a religious despotism, in which the supremacy of\r\nthe president should be subordinate only to the higher supremacy of the\r\nclergy.\r\n\r\nPresident Moreno was eventually assassinated at Quito, in August 1875,\r\nand Dr Borrero was elected to the presidency, but his tenure of power\r\nwas short. A revolution headed by General Veintemilla, the Radical\r\nleader, then military commandant at Guayaquil, broke out in 1876, and on\r\nthe 14th of December of that year the government forces under General\r\nAparicio were completely routed at Galte. Veintemilla was proclaimed\r\npresident, and in 1877 was duly elected by the cortes. He altered the\r\nconstitution in a more Liberal direction, and struck various blows at\r\nthe Clerical party, among other things abolishing the concordat with\r\nRome. In 1878 Veintemilla caused himself to be declared elected as\r\npresident for a term of four years. At the expiration of this period the\r\npresident assumed dictatorial powers and remained in office as chief of\r\nthe executive. This action on the part of General Veintemilla led to a\r\nunion between the Clericals and Moderate Liberals, and resulted in a\r\npopular rising throughout the republic, ending in his defeat and\r\noverthrow. His power was first restricted to Guayaquil and Esmeraldas,\r\nand finally General Rinaldo Flores drove him from Guayaquil, and\r\nVeintemilla fled (July 1883) to Peru. Dr Placido Caamano was then called\r\nupon to take charge temporarily, and on the 17th of February 1884 was\r\ndefinitely elected for the presidential period terminating in 1888.\r\nSeveral revolutionary outbreaks occurred during the Caamano\r\nadministration, but were successfully suppressed. In 1888 Dr Antonio\r\nFlores succeeded Caamano, the four years following being passed in\r\npeaceful conditions. In 1892 Dr Luis Cordero was elected, his\r\nadministration again plunging the country into an epoch of internal\r\ndisturbance.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the troubles under President Cordero was the assistance\r\nlent by Ecuador to Chile in the matter of the sale of the cruiser\r\n_Esmeralda_ to the Japanese government in 1894, in the middle of the\r\nJapanese-Chinese War. The government of Chile arranged the sale of the\r\n_Esmeralda_, but wished to be free from all danger of international\r\ncomplications in the affair. To this end the transfer of the vessel was\r\nmade to Ecuador, and she proceeded to Ecuadorian waters. On arriving at\r\nthe Galapagos Islands the flag of Ecuador was replaced by that of Japan\r\nand the vessel handed over to the representatives of that nation sent\r\nfor the purpose. When the part played by President Cordero in this\r\ntransaction became known, an outburst of popular indignation occurred.\r\nAn insurrection, headed by General Eloy Alfaro, followed; and after\r\ndesultory skirmishing extending over a period of nearly a year the\r\ngovernment forces were finally routed, President Cordero abandoning his\r\noffice and escaping from the country.\r\n\r\nGeneral Alfaro then assumed dictatorial powers as supreme chief of the\r\nnation, continuing in this capacity until the 6th of February 1897, on\r\nwhich date he was declared to be elected president of the republic. A\r\nseries of revolutionary movements against the administration of\r\nPresident Alfaro occurred in the course of the next few years. Many of\r\nthese risings were due to the intrigues of the Church party, and in view\r\nof these circumstances President Alfaro curtailed the influence of the\r\nclergy in several directions. On the 31st of August 1901 General Alfaro\r\npeacefully handed over the presidency to his elected successor, General\r\nLeonidas Plaza.\r\n\r\nGeneral Plaza continued the anticlerical policy of his predecessor.\r\nCivil marriage and divorce were introduced, and in 1904 all religions\r\nwere placed on a position of equality in the eye of the law, and the\r\nfoundation of new monasteries and convents was forbidden. The final year\r\nof Plaza's tenure of office was marked by a still stronger measure, all\r\nthe property of the church being declared to be national property, and\r\nlet to the highest bidders. In 1905 the Opposition made an effort to\r\neffect a change of policy, and were successful in obtaining the election\r\nof Lizaro Garcia, a well-to-do merchant and a director of the Banco\r\ncommercial y Agricola. General Alfaro, however, appealed to arms,\r\nejected Garcia from office, and made himself ruler with practically\r\ndictatorial powers.\r\n\r\nThe more recent history of Ecuador would not be complete without a\r\nreference to the work of Mr Archer Harman (b. 1860), an American railway\r\nbuilder and financier whose connexion with the construction of the\r\nGuayaquil and Quito railway began in 1897. To his personal energy and\r\nenterprise, as manager of the railway company, was largely due the\r\ncontinued prosecution of this difficult engineering undertaking, in\r\nconnexion with which he was responsible for a thorough reconstruction of\r\nEcuador finance. He thus came to exercise a powerful influence on the\r\ninternal progress of the country.\r\n\r\n  See C.E. Akers, _History of South America, 1854-1904_ (London, 1904);\r\n  H.W.

[Greek: ekzema], a cutaneous eruption), one of the most\r\ncommon and important of all skin diseases, consisting of a catarrhal\r\ninflammation of the skin originating without visible external\r\nirritation, and characterized in some stage of its evolution by a serous\r\nexudation. This definition excludes all those forms of inflammation of\r\nthe skin (dermatitis), which though they may be identical in course and\r\nmanifestation are yet caused by chemical or mechanical irritants. For an\r\nattack of eczema two conditions are necessary: a predisposition or\r\nspecial irritability of the skin, and a directly exciting cause. The\r\nfirst of these conditions is usually inherited or depends on some\r\nunderlying constitutional state. Thus any organic lesion which may\r\nproduce oedema and malnutrition of the cutis and epidermis as in kidney\r\ndiseases, any condition of imperfect metabolism as in dyspepsia or\r\nmalnutrition, or seborrhoea, may be the predisposing cause. Another\r\ninfluence that has received increasing attention from skin specialists\r\nis that of any nervous shock or prolonged mental strain. A \"chill\" is\r\nfollowed in most people by an ordinary cold, but in some by an attack of\r\neczema. Again, it may be caused by reflex nervous irritation from the\r\nuterus, stomach, &c. In some women it always accompanies menstruation,\r\nand in others pregnancy. It is of common occurrence in infancy, being\r\nattributed by some specialists to dentition, but by others to\r\nseborrhoea. Also there is an undoubted relationship between eczema and\r\ncertain forms of functional neurosis, of which perhaps asthma is the\r\nmost striking illustration, some physicians considering the latter\r\ntrouble to be eczema of the bronchial tubes. Sufferers from rheumatism\r\nand gout are also specially prone to eczema, though the exact\r\nrelationship is a much disputed point. There are yet other cases that\r\nare undoubtedly microbic, but the micro-organism cannot produce the\r\nlesion unless the soil is suitable. As a rule it is not contagious,\r\nthough when complicated by micro-organisms it may be auto-inoculable, or\r\nmore rarely inoculable from one patient to another. Except between the\r\nages of ten and twenty years when menstruation is becoming established,\r\nand again at the menopause, males are more liable to be attacked than\r\nfemales. In old age the sex influence is lost.\r\n\r\nAn attack of eczema is usually described as acute or chronic, but the\r\nonly distinction lies in the greater or less intensity of the\r\ninflammation at the time of description: it has nothing to do with the\r\nlength of time that the disease has lasted. The illness usually begins\r\nwith a feeling of itching and burning at the site of the lesion. The\r\nskin becomes covered with an erythematous blush, on which numerous tiny\r\nvesicles form. Swelling, heat, redness and tension are all present. The\r\nvesicles grow larger, run together, and either burst or are broken by\r\nthe patient's scratching, a clear fluid exuding which stiffens linen.\r\nThe discharge does not dry up at once, but continues to exude--hence the\r\nname of \"weeping eczema\" when this is a prominent symptom. In mild cases\r\nthe symptoms begin to subside in a few days, the exudation growing less\r\nand scales and scabs forming, under which new skin is formed. But where\r\nthe attack is more acute fresh crops of vesicles spring up and the\r\nprocess repeats itself. In some cases papules are the predominant\r\nlesions, but in others, especially when the face is attacked, the\r\nerythematous condition is more marked. A severe attack of eczema is\r\nusually accompanied by some slight constitutional disturbance, but the\r\ngeneral health seldom suffers appreciably, unless, as occasionally, the\r\nitching is so bad as to make sleep impossible. The irritation and local\r\nheat may be out of all proportion to visible changes in the skin, and in\r\nneurotic patients the nervous excitement may be extreme. The attack may\r\ncentre itself on any part of the body, but there are certain places\r\nwhere it more usually begins, such as the bends of the elbows, the backs\r\nof the knees and the groins; the groove behind the ears, the scalp, the\r\npalms or the soles, and the breasts of women. According to its position\r\nthe form of the eczema is somewhat modified. On the front of the legs\r\nand arms, from the uniform redness it exhibits in these positions, it is\r\nknown as eczema rubrum. On the scalp it is generally of the seborrhoeic\r\ntype, and in children, especially when pediculi are present, it will\r\nbecome pustular from microbic infection. On the palms and soles it\r\nbrings about a thickening of the epidermis which leads to the formation\r\nof cracks, and is hence called eczema rimosum.\r\n\r\nThe disease can best be treated by a combination of internal and\r\nexternal remedies. Internally, when the inflammation is acute, nothing\r\nis so good as antimony, since this relieves the arterial tension and\r\nthus reduces the local inflammation. But this must never be given when\r\nthe patient is suffering from depression. In other cases, especially for\r\nbabies and children, small doses of calomel are very beneficial;\r\nstrychnine, phosphorus and ergot are all useful at times. When nervous\r\nexcitement is marked it must be treated with sedatives. Arsenic and iron\r\nare both contra-indicated in this disease, since they increase blood\r\nformation and hence stimulate the eczematous process. Internal treatment\r\nis always best when combined with local treatment, but as a preliminary\r\nto this all crusts and scales must first be removed to allow the remedy\r\nfree access to the disease. Locally the aim is (1) to overcome any\r\nsource of irritation, (2) to protect the inflamed surface from the air\r\nand from microbic infection, and (3) to relieve the itching. The diet\r\nshould be simple but nourishing, and all hygienic precautions must be\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDAM, a town of Holland in the province of North Holland, close to the\r\nZuider Zee, about 13 m. N.N.E. of Amsterdam by steam tramway. It is\r\nconnected with the Zuider Zee by a fine canal protected by a large\r\nsea-lock (1828), and has regular steam-boat communication in various\r\ndirections. Pop. (1900) 6444. The many quaint old brick houses form the\r\nchief feature of interest in the town. The facades are frequently\r\nadorned with carvings and inscriptions, one of which records the legend\r\nof the capture of a siren in 1403, who lived for some time among the\r\npeople of Edam, but escaped again to the sea. The Great Church of St\r\nNicholas, probably founded in the 14th century, was largely rebuilt\r\nafter a fire in 1602, which, originating in the church, destroyed nearly\r\nthe whole town. It contains some fine stained glass and carved woodwork\r\nof this period. The Little Church (15th century) was demolished in 1883,\r\nexcept for a portion of the nave and the old tower and steeple, from\r\nwhich the bells curiously project. The town hall dates from 1737, and\r\nthere is a museum founded in 1895. Edam has some trade in timber, while\r\nshipbuilding, rope-spinning and salt-boiling are also carried on. It\r\ngives its name to the description of \"sweet-milk cheese\" (_zoetemelks\r\nkaas_) made throughout North Holland, which is familiar on account of\r\nits round shape and red rind.\r\n\r\nEdam took its name and origin from the dam built on the little river Ye\r\nwhich joined the great Purmer lake close by. Free access to the Zuider\r\nZee was obtained by the construction of a new dock in 1357, in which\r\nyear the town also received civic rights from William V. of Bavaria,\r\ncount of Holland. Owing to the danger of the extension of the Purmer and\r\nBeemster lakes, Philip II. of Spain caused a sluice to be built into the\r\ndock in 1567. In the next century Edam was a great shipbuilding centre,\r\nand nearly the whole of Admiral de Ruyter's fleet was built here; but in\r\nthe same century the harbour began to get blocked up, and the importance\r\nand industrial activity of the city slowly waned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDDA, the title given to two very remarkable collections of old\r\nIcelandic literature. Of these only one bears that title from antiquity;\r\nthe other is called _Edda_ by a comparatively modern misnomer. The word\r\nis unknown to any ancient northern language, and is first met with in\r\n_Rigspula_, a fragmentary poem at the end of Codex Wormianus, dated\r\nabout 1200, where it is introduced as the name or title of a\r\ngreat-grandmother. From the 14th to the 17th century, this word--but no\r\none has formed a reasonable conjecture why--was used to signify the\r\ntechnical laws of Icelandic court metre, _Eddu regla_, and \"Never to\r\nhave seen Edda\" was a modest apology for ignorance of the highest poetic\r\nart. The only work known by this name to the ancients was the\r\nmiscellaneous group of writings put together by Snorri Sturlason (q.v.;\r\n1178-1241), the greatest name in old Scandinavian literature. It is\r\nbelieved that the _Edda_, as he left it, was completed about 1222.\r\nWhether he gave this name to the work is doubtful; the title first\r\noccurs in the Upsala Codex, transcribed about fifty years after his\r\ndeath. The collection of Snorri is now known as the _Prose or Younger\r\nEdda_, the title of the _Elder Edda_ being given to a book of ancient\r\nmythological poems, discovered by the Icelandic bishop of Skalaholt,\r\nBrynjulf Sveinsson, in 1643, and erroneously named by him the _Edda of\r\nSaemund_.\r\n\r\n1. The Prose _Edda_, properly known as _Edda Snorra Sturlusonar_, was\r\narranged and modified by Snorri, but actually composed, as has been\r\nconjectured, between the years 1140 and 1160. It is divided into five\r\nparts, the Preface or _Formali_, _Gylfaginning_, _Bragaraedur_,\r\n_Skaldskaparmal_ and _Hattatal_. The preface bears a very modern\r\ncharacter, and simply gives a history of the world from Adam and Eve, in\r\naccordance with the Christian tradition. _Gylfaginning_, or the Delusion\r\nof Gylfi, on the other hand, is the most precious compendium which we\r\npossess of the mythological system of the ancient inhabitants of\r\nScandinavia. Commencing with the adventures of a mythical king Gylfi and\r\nthe giantess Gefion, and the miraculous formation of the island of\r\nZealand, it tells us that the Aesir, led by Odin, invaded Svithjod or\r\nSweden, the land of Gylfi, and settled there. It is from the\r\n_Ynglingasaga_ and from the _Gylfaginning_ that we gain all the\r\ninformation we possess about the conquering deities or heroes who set\r\ntheir stamp upon the religion of the North. Advancing from the Black Sea\r\nnorthwards through Russia, and westward through Esthonia, the Aesir seem\r\nto have overrun the south lands of Scandinavia, not as a horde but as an\r\nimmigrant aristocracy. The Eddaic version, however, of the history of\r\nthe gods is not so circumstantial as that in the _Ynglingasaga_; it is,\r\non the other hand, distinguished by an exquisite simplicity and archaic\r\nforce of style, which give an entirely classical character to its\r\nmythical legends of Odin and of Loki. The _Gylfaginning_ is written in\r\nprose, with brief poetic insertions. The _Bragaraedur_, or sayings of\r\nBragi, are further legends of the deities, attributed to Bragi, the god\r\nof poetry, or to a poet of the same name. The _Skaldskaparmal_, or Art\r\nof Poetry, commonly called _Skalda_, contains the instructions given by\r\nBragi to Aegir, and consists of the rules and theories of ancient verse,\r\nexemplified in copious extracts from Eyvindr Skaldaspillir and other\r\neminent Icelandic poets. The word _Skaldskapr_ refers to the form rather\r\nthan the substance of verse, and this treatise is almost solely\r\ntechnical in character. It is by far the largest of the sections of the\r\n_Edda_ of Snorri, and comprises not only extracts but some long poems,\r\nnotably the _Thorsdrapa_ of Eilifr Gudrunarson and the _Haustlaung_ of\r\nThjodolfr. The fifth section of the _Edda_, the _Hattatal_, or Number of\r\nMetres, is a running technical commentary on the text of Snorri's three\r\npoems written in honour of Haakon, king of Norway. Affixed to some MS.\r\nof the _Younger Edda_ are a list of poets, and a number of philological\r\ntreatises and grammatical studies. These belong, however, to a later\r\nperiod than the life of Snorri Sturlason.\r\n\r\n  The three oldest MSS. of the prose _Edda_ all belong to the beginning\r\n  of the 14th century. The Wurm MS. was sent to Ole Wurm in 1628; the\r\n  Codex Regius was discovered by the indefatigable bishop Brynjulf\r\n  Sveinsson in 1640. The most important, however, of these MSS. is the\r\n  Upsala Codex, an octavo volume written probably about the year 1300.\r\n  There have been several good editions of the _Edda Snorra\r\n  Sturlusonar_, of which perhaps the best is that published by the\r\n  Arne-Magnaean Society in Copenhagen in 1848-1852, in two vols., edited\r\n  by a group of scholars under the direction of Jon Sigurdsson. There\r\n  are English translations by T. Percy, _Northern Antiquities_, from the\r\n  French by P.H. Mallet (1770); by G. Webbe Dasent (Stockholm, 1842); by\r\n  R.B. Anderson (Chicago, 1880).\r\n\r\n2. The Elder _Edda_, Poetic _Edda_ or _Saemundar Edda hins froda_ was\r\nentirely unknown until about 1643, when it came into the hands of\r\nBrynjulf Sveinsson, who, puzzled to classify it, gave it the title of\r\n_Edda Saemundi multiscii_. Saemund Sigfusson, who was thus credited with\r\nthe collection of these poems, was a scion of the royal house of Norway,\r\nand lived from about 1055 to 1132 in Iceland. The poems themselves date\r\nin all probability from the 10th and 11th centuries, and are many of\r\nthem only fragments of longer heroic chants now otherwise entirely lost.\r\nThey treat of mythical and religious legends of an early Scandinavian\r\ncivilization, and are composed in the simplest and most archaic forms of\r\nIcelandic verse. The author of no one of them is mentioned. It is\r\nevident that they were collected from oral tradition; and the fact that\r\nthe same story is occasionally repeated, in varied form, and that some\r\nof the poems themselves bear internal evidence of being more ancient\r\nthan others, proves that the present collection is only a gathering made\r\nearly in the middle ages, long after the composition of the pieces, and\r\nin no critical spirit. Sophus Bugge, indeed, one of the greatest\r\nauthorities, absolutely rejects the name of Saemund, and is of opinion\r\nthat the poetic _Edda_, as we at present hold it, dates from about 1240.\r\nThere is no doubt that it was collected in Iceland, and by an Icelander.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable and the most ancient of the poems in this priceless\r\ncollection is that with which it commences, the _Voluspa_, or prophecy\r\nof the Volva or Sibyl. In this chant we listen to an inspired\r\nprophetess, \"seated on her high seat, and addressing Odin, while the\r\ngods listen to her words.\"\r\n\r\nShe sings of the world before the gods were made, of the coming and the\r\nmeeting of the Aesir, of the origin of the giants, dwarfs and men, of\r\nthe happy beginning of all things, and the sad ending that shall be in\r\nthe chaos of Ragnarok. The latter part of the poem is understood to be a\r\nkind of necromancy--according to Vigfusson, \"the raising of a dead\r\nvolva\"; but the mystical language of the whole, its abrupt transitions\r\nand terse condensations, and above all the extinct and mysterious\r\ncosmology, an acquaintance with which it presupposes, make the exact\r\ninterpretation of the _Voluspa_ extremely difficult. The charm and\r\nsolemn beauty of the style, however, are irresistible, and we are\r\nconstrained to listen and revere as if we were the auditors of some\r\nfugual music devised in honour of a primal and long-buried deity. The\r\nmelodies of this earliest Icelandic verse, elaborate in their extreme\r\nand severe simplicity, are wholly rhythmical and alliterative, and\r\nreturn upon themselves like a solemn incantation. _Havamal_, the Lesson\r\nof the High One, or Odin, follows next; this contains proverbs and wise\r\nsaws, and a series of stories, some of them comical, told by Odin\r\nagainst himself. The _Vafprudnismal_, or Lesson of Vafprudnir, is\r\nwritten in the same mystical vein as _Voluspa_; in it the giant who\r\ngives his name to the poem is visited by Odin in disguise, and is\r\nquestioned by him about the cosmogony and chronology of the Norse\r\nreligion. _Grimnismal_, or the Sayings of The Hooded One, which is\r\npartly in prose, is a story of Odin's imprisonment and torture by King\r\nGeirrod. _For Skirnis_, or the Journey of Skirnir, _Harbardsliod_, or\r\nthe Lay of Hoarbeard, _Hymiskvida_, or the Song of Hymir, and\r\n_Aegisdrekka_, or the Brewing of Aegir, are poems, frequently composed\r\nas dialogue, containing legends of the gods, some of which are so\r\nludicrous that it has been suggested that they were intentionally\r\nburlesque. _Thrymskvida_, or the Song of Thrym, possesses far more\r\npoetic interest; it recounts in language of singular force and\r\ndirectness how Thor lost his hammer, stolen by Thrym the giant, how the\r\nlatter refused to give it up unless the goddess Freyia was given him in\r\nmarriage, and how Thor, dressed in women's raiment, personated Freyia,\r\nand, slaying Thrym, recovered his hammer. _Alvissmal_, or the Wisdom of\r\nAllwise, is actually a philological exercise under the semblance of a\r\ndialogue between Thor and Alvis the dwarf. In _Vegtamskvida_, or the\r\nSong of Vegtam, Odin questions a volva with regard to the meaning of the\r\nsinister dreams of Balder. _Rigsmal_, or more properly _Rigspula_,\r\nrecords how the god Heimdall, disguised as a man called Rig, wandered by\r\nthe sea-shore, where he met the original dwarf pair, Ai and Edda, to\r\nwhom he gave the power of child-bearing, and thence sprung the whole\r\nrace of thralls; then he went on and met with Afi and Amma, and made\r\nthem the parents of the race of churls; then he proceeded until he came\r\nto Fadir and Modir, to whom he gave Jarl, the first of free men, whom he\r\nhimself brought up, teaching him to shoot and snare, and to use the\r\nsword and runes. It is much to be lamented that of this most\r\ncharacteristic and picturesque poem we possess only a fragment. In\r\n_Hyndluljod_, the Lay of Hyndla, the goddess Freyia rides to question\r\nthe volva Hyndla with regard to the ancestry of her young paramour\r\nOttar; a very fine quarrel ensues between the prophetess and her\r\nvisitor. With this poem, the first or wholly mythological portion of the\r\ncollection closes. What follows is heroic and pseudo-historic. The\r\n_Volundarkvida_, or Song of Volundr, is engaged with the adventures of\r\nVolundr, the smith-king, during his stay with Nidud, king of Sweden.\r\nVolundr, identical with the Anglo-Saxon Weland and the German Wieland\r\n(O.H.G. _Wiolant_), is sometimes confused with Odin, the master-smith.\r\nThis poem contains the beautiful figure of Svanhvit, the swan-maiden,\r\nwho stays seven winters with Volundr, and then, yearning for her\r\nfatherland, flies away home through the dark forest. _Helgakvida,\r\nHiorvards sonar_, the Song of Helgi, the Son of Hiorvard, which is\r\nlargely in prose, celebrates the wooing by Helgi of Svava, who, like\r\nAtalanta, ends by loving the man with whom she has fought in battle. Two\r\nSongs of Helgi the Hunding's Bane, _Helgakvida Hundingsbana_, open the\r\nlong and very important series of lays relating to the two heroic\r\nfamilies of the Volsungs and the Niblungs. Including the poems just\r\nmentioned, there are about twenty distinct pieces in the poetic _Edda_\r\nwhich deal more or less directly with this chain of stories. It is\r\nhardly necessary to give the titles of these poems here in detail,\r\nespecially as they are, in their present form, manifestly only fragments\r\nof a great poetic saga, possibly the earliest coherent form of the story\r\nso universal among the Teutonic peoples. We happily possess a somewhat\r\nlater prose version of this lost poem in the _Volsungasaga_, where the\r\nstory is completely worked out. In many places the prose of the\r\n_Volsungasaga_ follows the verse of the Eddaic fragments with the\r\ngreatest precision, often making use of the very same expressions. At\r\nthe same time there are poems in the _Edda_ which the author of the saga\r\ndoes not seem to have seen. But if we compare the central portions of\r\nthe myth, namely Sigurd's conversation with Fafnir, the death of Regin,\r\nthe speech of the birds and the meeting with the Valkyrje, we are struck\r\nwith the extreme fidelity of the prose romancer to his poetic precursors\r\nin the _Sigurdarkvida Fafnisbana_; in passing on to the death of Sigurd,\r\nwe perceive that the version in the _Volsungasaga_ must be based upon a\r\npoem now entirely lost. Of the origin of the myth and its independent\r\ndevelopment in medieval Germany, this is not the place for discussion\r\n(see NIBELUNGENLIED). Suffice to say that in no modernized or Germanized\r\nform does the legend attain such an exquisite colouring of heroic poetry\r\nas in these earliest fragments of Icelandic song. A very curious poem,\r\nin some MSS. attributed directly to Saemund, is the Song of the Sun,\r\n_Solarliod_, which forms a kind of appendix to the poetic _Edda_. In\r\nthis the spirit of a dead father addresses his living son, and exhorts\r\nhim, with maxims that resemble those of _Havamal_, to righteousness of\r\nlife. The tone of the poem is strangely confused between Christianity\r\nand Paganism, and it has been assumed to be the composition of a writer\r\nin the act of transition between the old creed and the new. It may,\r\nhowever, not impossibly, be altogether spurious as a poem of great\r\nantiquity, and may merely be the production of some Icelandic monk,\r\nanxious to imitate the Eddaic form and spirit. Finally _Forspjallsljod_,\r\nor the Preamble, formerly known as the Song of Odin's Raven, is an\r\nextremely obscure fragment, of which little is understood, although\r\ninfinite scholarship has been expended on it. With this the poetic\r\n_Edda_ closes.\r\n\r\n  The principal MS. of this _Edda_ is the Codex Regius in the royal\r\n  library at Copenhagen, written continuously, without regard to prose\r\n  or verse, on 45 vellum leaves. This is that found by Bishop Brynjulf.\r\n  Another valuable fragment exists in the Arne-Magnaean collection in\r\n  the University of Copenhagen, consisting of four sheets, 22 leaves in\r\n  all. These are the only MSS. older than the 17th century which contain\r\n  a collection of the ancient mythico-heroic lays, but fragments occur\r\n  in various other works, and especially in the _Edda_ of Snorri. It is\r\n  believed to have been written between 1260 and 1280. The poetic _Edda_\r\n  was translated into English verse by Amos Cottle in 1797; the poet\r\n  Gray produced a version of the _Vegtamskvida_; but the first good\r\n  translation of the whole was that published by Benjamin Thorpe in\r\n  1866. An excellent edition of the Icelandic text has been prepared by\r\n  Th. Mobius, but the standard of the original orthography will be found\r\n  in the admirable edition of Sophus Bugge, _Norroen Fornkvaedi_,\r\n  published at Christiania in 1867.\r\n\r\n  The Eddaic poems were rearranged, on a system of their own which\r\n  differs entirely from that of the early MSS., by Gudbrand Vigfusson\r\n  and F. York Powell, in their _Corpus poeticum boreale_ (Oxford, 1883).\r\n  This is a collection, not of _Edda_ only but of all existing fragments\r\n  of the vast lyrical literature of ancient Iceland. It supplies a prose\r\n  translation.     (E. G.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDDIUS (AEDDI), a Kentish choirmaster, summoned by Wilfrid (c. 634-709),\r\nbishop of York, to help in organizing church services in Northumbria. He\r\nwrote the _Life_ of his patron, and this biography of St Wilfrid is the\r\nearliest extant historical work compiled by an Anglo-Saxon author. He is\r\na strong partisan and very credulous, but the _Vita Wilfridi_ is\r\nnevertheless invaluable for the period it treats. Its date is little\r\nafter the first decade of the 8th century, and it was used by Bede in\r\ncompiling his _Historia_.\r\n\r\n  See Eddius, _Vita Wilfridi_ (Raine, _Historians of Church of York_,\r\n  London, 1879-1894), 14; Bede, _Hist. Eccl._ (Plummer, Oxford, 1896),\r\n  iii. 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDELINCK, GERARD (1649-1707), Flemish copper-plate engraver, was born at\r\nAntwerp. The rudiments of the art, which he was to carry to a higher\r\npitch of excellence than it had previously reached, he acquired in his\r\nnative town under the engraver Cornelisz Galle. But he was not long in\r\nreaching the limits of his master's attainments; and then he went to\r\nParis to improve himself under the teaching of De Poilly. This master\r\nlikewise had soon done all he could to help him onwards, and Edelinck\r\nultimately took the first rank among line engravers. His excellence was\r\ngenerally acknowledged; and having become known to Louis XIV. he was\r\nappointed, on the recommendation of Le Brun, teacher at the academy\r\nestablished at the Gobelins for the training of workers in tapestry. He\r\nwas also entrusted with the execution of several important works. In\r\n1677 he was admitted member of the Paris Academy of Painting and\r\nSculpture. The work of this great engraver constitutes an epoch in the\r\nart. His prints number more than four hundred.\r\n\r\nEdelinck stands above and apart from his predecessors and contemporaries\r\nin that he excelled, not in some one respect, but in all respects,--that\r\nwhile one engraver attained excellence in correct form, and another in\r\nrendering light and shade, and others in giving colour to their prints\r\nand the texture of surfaces, he, as supreme master of the burin,\r\npossessed and displayed all these separate qualities, in so complete a\r\nharmony that the eye is not attracted by any one of them in particular,\r\nbut rests in the satisfying whole. Edelinck was the first to break\r\nthrough the custom of making prints square, and to execute them in the\r\nlozenge shape. Among his most famous works are a \"Holy Family,\" after\r\nRaphael; a \"Penitent Magdalene,\" after Charles le Brun; \"Alexander at\r\nthe Tent of Darius,\" after Le Brun; a \"Combat of Four Knights,\" after\r\nLeonardo da Vinci; \"Christ surrounded with Angels\"; \"St Louis praying\";\r\nand \"St Charles Borromeo before a crucifix,\"--the last three after Le\r\nBrun. Edelinck was especially good as an engraver of portraits, and\r\nexecuted prints of many of the most eminent persons of his time. Among\r\nthese are those of Le Brun, Rigaud, Philippe de Champagne (which the\r\nengraver thought his best), Santeuil, La Fontaine, Colbert, John Dryden,\r\nDescartes, &c. He died at Paris in 1707. His younger brother John, and\r\nhis son Nicholas, were also engravers, but did not attain to his\r\nexcellence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDELWEISS, known botanically as _Leontopodium alpinum_, a member of the\r\nfamily _Compositae_, a native of the Alps of Central Europe. It is a\r\nsmall herb reaching about 6 in. high, with narrow white woolly leaves,\r\nand terminal flower-heads enveloped in woolly bracts. The woolly\r\ncovering enables the plant to thrive in the exposed situations in which\r\nit is found, by protecting it from cold and from drying up through\r\nexcessive loss of moisture. It is grown in Britain as a rock-plant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDEN, SIR ASHLEY (1831-1887), Anglo-Indian official and diplomatist,\r\nthird son of Robert John Eden, third Lord Auckland and bishop of Bath\r\nand Wells, was born on the 13th of November 1831, and was educated at\r\nRugby, Winchester and the East India Company's college at Haileybury,\r\nentering the Indian civil service in 1852. In 1855 he gained distinction\r\nas assistant to the special commissioner for the suppression of the\r\nSantal rising, and in 1860 was appointed secretary to the Bengal\r\ngovernment with an _ex officio_ seat on the legislative council, a\r\nposition he held for eleven years. In 1861 he negotiated, as political\r\nagent, a treaty with the raja of Sikkim. His success led to his being\r\nsent on a similar mission to Bhutan in 1863; but, being unaccompanied by\r\nany armed force, his demands were rejected and he was forced under\r\ncircumstances of personal insult to come to an arrangement highly\r\nfavourable to the Bhutias. The result was the repudiation of the treaty\r\nby the Indian government and the declaration of war against Bhutan. In\r\n1871 Eden became the first civilian governor of British Burma, which\r\npost he held until his appointment in 1877 as lieutenant-governor of\r\nBengal. In 1878 he was made a K.C.S.I., and in 1882 resigned the\r\nlieutenant-governorship and returned to England on his appointment to\r\nthe council of the secretary of state for India, of which he remained a\r\nmember till his death on the 8th of July 1887. The success of his\r\nadministration of Bengal was attested by the statue erected in his\r\nhonour at Calcutta after his retirement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDEN, the name of the region in which, according to the Hebrew\r\nparadise-tradition in its present form, God planted a garden (or park),\r\nwherein he put the man whom he had formed (Gen. ii. 8). Research into\r\nprimitive beliefs, guided by the comparative method, leads to the view\r\nthat the \"garden\" was originally a celestial locality (see PARADISE),\r\nand we cannot therefore be surprised if, now that paradise has been\r\nbrought down to earth, the geographical details given in the Bible are\r\nrather difficult to work into a consistent picture. The fantastic\r\ngeography of the (Indian) _Vishnu Purana_ and the (Iranian) _Bundahish_\r\nwill, in this case, be a striking parallel.\r\n\r\nLet us now take the details of Eden as they occur. In Gen. ii. 8 we read\r\nthat the garden lay \"in Eden eastward,\" where \"eastward\" is generally\r\ntaken to mean \"in the east of the earth.\" This, however, seems\r\ninconsistent with Isa. xiv. 13, where the \"mountain of God,\" which\r\ncorresponds (see Ezek. xxviii. 13, 14 and the article ADAM) to the\r\n\"garden in Eden,\" is said to have been \"in the uttermost parts of the\r\nnorth\" (so R.V.). The former statement (\"eastward\") suits Babylonia,\r\nwhere Friedrich Delitzsch[1] places Eden; the latter does not. We are\r\nfurther told (v. 10) that \"a river went out from Eden to water the\r\ngarden,\" and that \"from thence it parted itself (?), and became four\r\nheads (?),\" which is commonly understood to mean that the river was so\r\nlarge that, soon after leaving the garden (\"from thence\" is all that the\r\ntext says), it could still supply four considerable streams (the text\r\nsays, not \"streams,\" but \"heads,\" i.e. perhaps \"beginnings\" or\r\n\"starting-points\"). In _vv._ 11-14 the names of four rivers are given,\r\nbut in spite of the descriptive supplements attached to three of them,\r\nonly that one which has no supplement can be identified with much\r\nprobability. In fact, Perath may without any obvious difficulty be\r\n\"Euphrates,\" except in Jer. xiii., where a more southerly stream seems\r\nindicated, but to the identification of \"Hiddekel\" with \"Tigris\"\r\n(Babylonian Diglat) the presence of the initial _Hi_ in the Hebrew is an\r\nobjection. Now as to \"Pishon\" and \"Gihon.\" If a moderately early\r\ntradition may be trusted, the \"Gihon\" is another name for the \"Shihor,\"\r\nwhich was either in or beside \"Mizraim\" (= Egypt) or Mizrim (= the North\r\nArabian Musri), and indeed according to most scholars means the Nile in\r\nJer. ii. 18, where the Septuagint substitutes for it Geon, i.e. Gihon.\r\nFor \"Pishon\" few plausible suggestions have been made; it is not,\r\nhowever, a hopeless problem from the point of view which recognizes Eden\r\nin Arabia.\r\n\r\nFor details of the interesting descriptive supplements of the names\r\nPishon, Gihon, and Hiddekel, on which there is much difference of\r\nopinion, it must suffice to refer to the _Encyclopaedia Biblica_ and\r\nHasting's _Dictionary of the Bible_. We must, however, mention a widely\r\nheld explanation of the name _Eden_. Plausible as it is to interpret\r\nthis name as \"delight\"--indeed, the Septuagint translates in Gen. iii.\r\n23 f. [Greek: ho paradeisos tes tryphes]--this cannot have been the\r\noriginal meaning. Hence Delitzsch (_Wo lag das Paradies?_ p. 79)\r\nsuggested that \"Eden\" might be a Hebraized form of the Babylonian\r\n_edinu_, \"field, plain, desert.\" But whereas Delitzsch takes \"Eden\" to\r\nbe the entire plain of Babylonia, Hommel thinks that it is rather the\r\nplain about the sacred city of Eridu. It is the latter scholar to whom\r\nthe \"Arabian theory\" of Paradise in its best-known form is due. The\r\nrivers (apart from Perath, \"Euphrates\") he locates in northern and\r\ncentral Arabia, the \"Cush\" and \"Asshur\" of Genesis being, according to\r\nhim, central Arabia and Edom respectively (_Ancient Hebrew Traditions_,\r\npp. 314-316; _Aufsatze u. Abhandlungen_, iii. 281-284, 335-339). These\r\nrivers, in short, become Arabian wadis, on which see Hast. _D.B._ i.\r\n132a (foot). Cheyne, on the other hand, rejects the Babylonian\r\nexplanation of Eden as = \"field, plain,\" on the ground that \"Eden\" was\r\noriginally regarded as a mountainous tract.\r\n\r\n  See further Driver, _Book of Genesis_ (1904), pp. 57-60; _Ency. Bib._\r\n  \"Paradise\"; and the commentaries of Gunkel (2nd ed., 1902), and Cheyne\r\n  (1907).     (T. K. C.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] _Wo lag das Paradies?_ p. 66. A Sumerian name of Babylon was\r\n    Tin-ter, \"dwelling of life.\" Cf.

S.S.E. of London, on the South-Eastern & Chatham,\r\nand the London, Brighton & South Coast railways. Pop. (1901) 2546. It is\r\npleasantly situated on the river Eden, an affluent of the Medway, in a\r\nvalley between the Ragstone Hills and the Forest Ridges. The church of\r\nSt Peter and St Paul is principally Perpendicular. The town, which has\r\nconsiderable agricultural trade, possesses a chalybeate spring, but this\r\nis little used. Two miles from the town is Hever Castle, a beautiful\r\nmoated mansion dating from the 15th and 16th centuries, but occupying\r\nthe site of an earlier structure. This was rebuilt by Sir Geoffrey\r\nBoleyn, whose grandson, Sir Thomas, was father of Anne, second wife of\r\nHenry VIII., who here spent much of her life before her marriage, and\r\nwas visited several times by the king. There is a chapel of her family\r\nin the fine parish church of Hever. Not far distant is the modern\r\nChiddingstone Castle, on an ancient site. A block of sandstone in the\r\npark is called the \"chiding stone,\" tradition asserting it to be a\r\nprehistoric seat of judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDEN HALL, LUCK OF, an old painted drinking goblet preserved at Eden\r\nHall, Cumberland, the seat of the Musgrave family. It is of enamelled or\r\npainted glass and is believed to date from the 10th century. It is of\r\nfair size and has the letters I.H.S. on the top. Round the vase is the\r\nfamous verse given below. A legend involving the fortunes of the\r\nMusgraves attaches to this cup. In the grounds of Eden Hall is a spring\r\ncalled St Cuthbert's Well, and the story is that one of the earliest of\r\nthe Musgraves surprised the fairies feasting and making merry round the\r\nwell. He snatched at the goblet from which the Fairy King was drinking\r\nand made off with it. The fairies pursued him to his castle, but failed\r\nto catch him. The Fairy King acknowledged his defeat and gave the cup as\r\na prize to Musgrave, but warned him that the gift carried with it a\r\ncondition:--\r\n\r\n  \"When this cup shall break or fall.\r\n   Farewell the luck of Eden Hall.\"\r\n\r\nThere are variants of this legend, but substantially they agree.\r\nPossessed of the lucky cup the knight of Musgrave is said to have at\r\nonce prospered in a love-suit which had till then gone against him.\r\nThere is a curious poem on the cup called \"The Drinking Match at Eden\r\nHall,\" by Philip, duke of Wharton, a parody on the ballad of Chevy\r\nChase. This is reprinted in full in Edward Walford's _Tales of Great\r\nFamilies_ (1877, vol. 11), under the heading, \"The witty Duke of\r\nWharton.\" In Longfellow's famous poem the goblet is represented as\r\nhaving been broken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDENKOBEN, a town of Germany, in the Bavarian Palatinate, 6 m. N. from\r\nLandau, on the railway to Weissenburg. Pop. 5300. It has a Roman\r\nCatholic and a Protestant church, several high-grade schools and a\r\nsulphur-spring. Its industries comprise linen- and damask-weaving,\r\nironworks, and the manufacture of machinery, furniture and cigars. It\r\nhas also a considerable trade in wine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDENTATA, the name assigned by Cuvier to an order of placental mammals\r\napparently typified by the South American anteater, but likewise\r\nincluding the sloths and armadillos of the same country, and the Old\r\nWorld aard-varks and pangolins. Only the anteaters and pangolins are\r\nabsolutely without teeth (Lat. _e_, out, _dens_, tooth), and the name is\r\nstrictly applicable only to those two groups; but in all the existing\r\nrepresentatives of the order teeth are absent from the front of the\r\njaws, while the cheek-teeth are devoid of roots and of enamel, and only\r\nvery exceptionally have deciduous predecessors. Practically this is all\r\nthe definition that can be given to the assemblage, which is possibly an\r\nartificial one. It may be mentioned, however, that there is not\r\nunfrequently a separate coracoid bone.\r\n\r\nEdentates may be divided into three distinct sections or suborders,\r\nfirstly the Xenarthra, or Edentata Vera, of America, secondly the\r\nTubulidenta, represented by the African aard-varks, and thirdly the\r\nPholidota, which includes only the pangolins common to Africa and Asia.\r\nThe Xenarthra are essentially a South and Central American group, some\r\nof the members of which have effected an entrance into North America.\r\nThe three families by which they are now represented are widely\r\nsundered, both as regards habits and structure; but two of them--the\r\nsloths and the anteaters--are intimately connected by means of the\r\nextinct ground-sloths. As regards the presumed relationship of the Old\r\nWorld to the New World types, it is noteworthy that in the early\r\nTertiary deposits of France and Germany are found certain fossil remains\r\napparently referable to armadillos, aard-varks and pangolins, some of\r\nthe armadillos coming very close to South American forms. This\r\nassemblage of three groups of edentates in the countries fringing\r\nnorthern Africa is suggestive that the latter continent may have been\r\nthe original home of the group, which reached South America by means of\r\na direct land connexion.\r\n\r\n_Xenarthra._--The typical American edentates, or Xenarthra, are\r\ncharacterized by the circumstance that the last dorsal and all the\r\nlumbar vertebrae carry additional articular facets, or abnormal\r\narticulations (xenarthral). Teeth may be absent or present, and when\r\ndeveloped either all similar (homaeodont) or to some extent\r\ndifferentiated. The bodily covering may take the form either of coarse\r\nhairs, or of bony plates, with a larger or smaller intermixture of\r\nhairs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Skull of Unau or Two-toed Sloth (_Choloepus\r\ndidactylus_).]\r\n\r\nOf the three existing families of this group, the first is that of the\r\n_Bradypodidae_, or sloths, characterized by the presence of five pairs\r\nof upper and four of lower teeth, the normally-formed tongue and the\r\nrudimentary tail. The species are arboreal and feed on leaves; all being\r\nconfined to the forests of tropical America. Externally sloths are\r\nclothed with long coarse, crisp hair; the head is short and rounded, and\r\nthe external ears inconspicuous. The teeth are subcylindrical, of\r\npersistent growth, consisting of a central axis of vasodentine, with a\r\nthin investment of hard dentine, and a thick outer coating of cement;\r\nwithout any succession. Fore-limbs greatly longer than the hind-limbs;\r\nthe extremities terminating in narrow, curved feet; with the digits\r\nnever exceeding three in number, and encased for nearly their whole\r\nlength in a common integument, and armed with long, strong claws.\r\nStomach complex. No caecum. Placenta deciduate and dome-like, composed\r\nof an aggregation of numerous discoidal lobes.\r\n\r\nA remarkable feature connected with sloths is the development of a green\r\ncolour in their hair, due to the growth of an alga. According to Dr\r\nW.G. Ridewood, in the three-toed sloth the hair is invested with a thick\r\nextra-cortical layer. \"The hair has a tendency to crack in a transverse\r\ndirection, and in the cracks there come to lodge unicellular algae, to\r\nwhich Kuhn has given the name _Pleurococcus bradypi_. The moisture of\r\nthe climate in which _Bradypus_ lives enables the alga to live and\r\npropagate in this curious position, and the sloth acquires a general\r\ngreen tint which must render it very difficult to distinguish as it\r\nhangs among the green foliage.\" In the two-toed sloth, on the other\r\nhand, the bulk of the hair is composed of an outer coat, or cortex,\r\nwhich is longitudinally fluted or grooved, the grooves being filled with\r\nstrands of extra-cortex in which flourishes an alga (_Pleurococcus\r\ncholoepi_) distinct from the one infesting the hairs of the three-toed\r\nspecies. Of quite a different type are the hairs of the extinct\r\nground-sloths (see MYLODON), which are smooth and solid, Dr Ridewood\r\nrejecting the idea that they were originally coated with a cortex that\r\nhas disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe typical genus _Bradypus_ is represented by the various species of\r\nai, or three-toed sloth, in which none of the teeth project greatly\r\nbeyond the others; the first in the upper jaw is much smaller than any\r\nof the others, while the first in the lower jaw is broad and compressed,\r\nand the grinding surfaces of all are much cupped. Vertebrae: C 9, D and\r\nL 20 (of which 15 to 17 bear ribs), S 6, Ca 11. All the species present\r\nthe peculiarity of possessing nine cervical vertebrae; but the ninth,\r\nand sometimes the eighth, bears a pair of short movable ribs. The\r\nfore-limbs are considerably longer than the hind-legs, and the bones of\r\nthe fore-arm are complete, free and capable of pronation and supination.\r\nThe fore-feet are long, very narrow, habitually curved and terminate in\r\nthree pointed curved claws, in close apposition to each other; they are,\r\nin fact, incapable of being divaricated, so that the foot is reduced to\r\nthe condition of a triple hook, fit only for the function of suspension\r\nfrom the boughs of trees. The hind-foot closely resembles the fore-foot\r\nin general structure and mode of use, and has the sole habitually turned\r\ninwards so that it cannot be applied to the ground in walking. The\r\ntongue is short and soft, and the stomach large and complex, bearing\r\nsome resemblance to that of ruminants. The windpipe or trachea has the\r\nremarkable peculiarity--not unfrequent among birds and reptiles--of\r\nbeing folded on itself before it reaches the lungs. The two teats are\r\npectoral in position. The premaxilla is rudimentary and loosely attached\r\nto the maxilla. Except in _B. torquatus_, there is no perforation in the\r\nlower end of the humerus. Some of the species are covered uniformly with\r\na grey or greyish-brown coat; others have a dark collar of elongated\r\nhairs around the shoulders (_B. torquatus_); some have the hair of the\r\nface shorter than that of the rest of the head and neck; and others have\r\na remarkable-looking patch of soft, short hair on the back between the\r\nshoulders, consisting, when best marked, of a median stripe of glossy\r\nblack, bordered on each side by bright orange, yellow or white. There\r\nare also structural differences in the skulls, as in the amount of\r\ninflation of the pterygoid bones. The habits of all are apparently\r\nalike. They are natives of Guiana, Brazil and Peru, and two species (_B.\r\ninfuscatus_ and _B. castaneiceps_) extend north of the Isthmus of Panama\r\nas far as Nicaragua. Of the former of these a specimen in captivity\r\nuttered a shrill sound like a monkey when forcibly pulled away from the\r\ntree to which it was holding.\r\n\r\nIn the species of unau, or two-toed sloths, _Choloepus_, the front tooth\r\nin both jaws is separated by an interval from the others, and is large\r\nand caniniform, wearing to a sharp bevelled edge against the opposing\r\ntooth, the upper shutting in front of the lower when the mouth is\r\nclosed, unlike true canines. Vertebrae: C 6 or 7, D 23-24, L 3, S 7-8,\r\nCa 4-6. One species (_C. didactylus_) has the ordinary number of\r\nvertebrae in the neck; but an otherwise closely allied form (_C.\r\nhoffmanni_) has but six. The tail is very rudimentary. The fore-feet\r\ngenerally resemble those of _Bradypus_, but there are only two\r\nfunctional digits, with claws; these answering to the second and third\r\nof the typical five-toed limb. The structure of the hind-limb generally\r\nresembles that of _Bradypus_, the appellation \"two-toed\" referring only\r\nto the anterior limb, for in the foot the three middle toes are\r\nfunctionally developed and of nearly equal size. The premaxilla is well\r\ndeveloped, and firmly attached to the maxilla; and there is always a\r\nperforation, or foramen, on the inner side of the lower end of the\r\nhumerus. _C. didactylus_, which has been longest known, and is commonly\r\ncalled by the native name of unau, inhabits the forests of Brazil. _C.\r\nhoffmanni_ has a more northern geographical range, extending from\r\nEcuador through Panama to Costa Rica. Its voice, which is seldom heard,\r\nis like the bleat of a sheep, and if the animal is seized it snorts\r\nviolently. Both species are very variable in external coloration (see\r\nSLOTH).\r\n\r\nThe second family is that of the anteaters, _Myrmecophagidae_,\r\ndistinguished from the last by the absence of teeth, the elongated\r\ntongue and the long tail. The long and slender head has a tubular mouth,\r\nwith a small terminal aperture through which the worm-like tongue,\r\ncovered with the sticky secretion of the enormous submaxillary salivary\r\nglands, is rapidly protruded in feeding, and withdrawn again with the\r\nadhering particles of food which are then sucked into the gullet. In the\r\nfoot the third toe is greatly developed, and has a long sickle-like\r\nclaw; the others are reduced or suppressed. The hind-foot has four or\r\nfive subequal digits with claws. The long tail is sometimes prehensile.\r\nPlacenta dome-like or discoidal. Externally the body is covered with\r\nhair. Anteaters feed exclusively on animal substances, mostly insects.\r\nOne species is terrestrial, the others arboreal; none burrow in the\r\nground. They are all inhabitants of tropical America. In the typical\r\ngenus _Myrmecophaga_ the skull is remarkably elongated and narrow, with\r\nits upper surface smooth and cylindriform. Anteriorly the face is\r\nproduced into a long tubular rostrum, rounded above and flattened below,\r\nwith terminal nostrils, and composed of the mesethmoid (ossified for\r\nmore than half its length), the vomer, the maxillae, and the long and\r\nnarrow nasal bones, the premaxillae being extremely short and confined\r\nto the margin of the nostrils. The zygomatic arch is incomplete, the\r\nrod-like jugal only articulating with the maxilla in front, and not\r\nreaching the short zygomatic process of the squamosal. The lachrymal\r\nforamen is in front of the margin of the orbit. There are no\r\npost-orbital processes to the frontals or any other demarcation between\r\nthe orbits and the temporal fossae. Palate extremely elongated, and\r\nproduced backwards as far as the level of the external auditory meatus\r\nby the meeting in the middle line of the largely developed pterygoids.\r\nThe glenoid fossa for the lower jaw, a shallow oval facet, with its long\r\ndiameter from before backwards. Lower jaw long and slender, with an\r\nexceedingly short symphysis, no distinct coronoid process, and a\r\nslightly elevated, elongated, flattened, condylar articular surface.\r\nVertebrae: C 7, D 15-16, L 3-2, S 6, Ca 31. Clavicles rudimentary. In\r\nthe fore-foot the first digit is very slender, the second also slender,\r\nwith compressed phalanges of nearly equal length, but the third is\r\nimmensely developed, though its first phalanx is extremely short, while\r\nthe terminal one is so long that the entire length of the digit exceeds\r\nthat of the second. The fourth has a long and rather slender metacarpal,\r\nand three phalanges diminishing in size, the terminal phalange being\r\nvery small. The fifth has the metacarpal nearly as long, but not so\r\nstout as the fourth, and followed by two small phalanges, the last\r\nrudimentary and conical. Claws are developed upon all but the fifth. In\r\nwalking the toes are kept bent, with their points turned upwards and\r\ninwards, the weight being supported on a pad over the end of the fifth\r\ndigit, and the upper surfaces of the third and fourth digits. The hind\r\nfeet are short and rather broad, with five subequal claws, the fourth\r\nrather longest, the first shortest; the whole sole is placed on the\r\nground in walking. Body rather compressed, clothed with long, coarse\r\nhair. Tail about as long as the body, and covered with very long hair;\r\nnot prehensile. Ears small, oval, erect. Eyes very small. Stomach\r\nconsisting of a sub-globular, thin-walled, cardiac portion, and a\r\nmuscular pyloric gizzard with dense epithelial lining. No ileocolic\r\nvalve; but a short, wide, ill-defined caecum. The two teats are\r\npectoral.\r\n\r\nThe tamandua anteaters (_Tamandua_, or _Uroleptes_), of which several\r\nspecies (or races) are now recognized, are smaller animals than the\r\nlast, in which the head is much less elongated, the fur short and\r\nbristly, and the tail, tapering, prehensile, with the under side\r\nthroughout, and the whole of the terminal portion naked and scaly. The\r\nstomach is similar to that of _Myrmecophaga_, but with the muscular\r\npyloric gizzard less strongly developed. There is a distinct ileocolic\r\nvalve and short globular caecum. The fore-foot has a very large claw on\r\nthe third toe, moderate-sized claws on the second and fourth, a minute\r\none on the first, and none on the fifth, which is entirely concealed\r\nwithin the skin. The hind-foot has five subequal claws. Vertebrae: C 7,\r\nD 17, L 2, S 5, Ca 37. There are very rudimentary clavicles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--Tamandua Anteater (_Tamandua tetradactyla_).]\r\n\r\nThe last representative of the family is the tiny golden-haired pigmy or\r\ntwo-toed anteater, _Cyclopes_ (or _Cycloturus_) _didactylus_, in which\r\nthe skull is much shorter even than in the preceding genus, and arched\r\nconsiderably in the longitudinal direction. It differs from that of the\r\nother members of the family mainly in the long canal for the posterior\r\nnostrils not being closed by bone below, as the greater part of the\r\npalatines and the pterygoids do not meet in the middle line. The lower\r\njaw has a prominent, narrow, recurved coronoid, and a well-developed\r\nangular process, and is strongly decurved in front. Vertebrae: C 7, D\r\n16, L 2, S 4, Ca 40. Ribs remarkably broad and flat. Clavicles well\r\ndeveloped. Fore-foot remarkably modified, having the third digit greatly\r\ndeveloped at the expense of all the others; it has a short stout\r\nmetacarpal and but two phalanges, of which the terminal one is large,\r\ncompressed, pointed and much curved, with a strong hook-like claw. The\r\nsecond digit has the same number of phalanges, and bears a claw, but is\r\nmuch more slender than the third. The fourth is represented only by the\r\nmetacarpal, and one nailless phalange, the first and fifth only by\r\nrudimentary metacarpals. The hind-foot is also modified into a climbing\r\norgan, the first toe being rudimentary and consisting of a metatarsal\r\nand one phalange concealed beneath the skin, but the other four toes\r\nsubequal and much curved, with long, pointed, compressed claws. The\r\ntuberosity of the heel-bone or calcaneum is directed towards the sole,\r\nand parallel with it and extending to about double its length is a\r\ngreatly elongated sesamoid ossicle. These together support a prominent\r\ncushion to which the nails are opposed in climbing. Stomach pyriform,\r\nwith muscular walls, but no distinct gizzard-like portion. The\r\ncommencement of the colon provided with two small caeca, narrow at the\r\nbase, but rather dilated at their terminal blind ends, and communicating\r\nwith the general cavity by very minute apertures. Tail longer than the\r\nbody, tapering, bare on the under surface and prehensile. Fur soft and\r\nsilky.\r\n\r\nThe third and last existing family of the Xenarthra is that of the\r\narmadillos, or _Dasypodidae_, in which there are at least seven pairs of\r\nteeth in each jaw, while the tongue is normal, the tail generally long,\r\nand the body covered with an armour of bony plates overlain by horny\r\nscales. All the species are terrestrial, and insectivorous or more or\r\nless omnivorous.\r\n\r\nThe union of the numerous polygonal bony shields on the back and sides\r\nforms a hard shield, usually consisting of an anterior (scapular) and\r\nposterior (pelvic) solid portion (which overhang on each side the parts\r\nof the body they respectively cover, forming chambers into which the\r\nlimbs are withdrawn), and a variable number of rings between, connected\r\nby soft flexible skin so as to allow of curvature of the body. The top\r\nof the head has also a similar shield, and the tail is usually encased\r\nin bony rings or plates. The outer or exposed surfaces of the limbs are\r\nprotected by irregular bony plates, not united at their margins; but the\r\nskin of the inner surface of the limbs and under side of the body is\r\nsoft and more or less clothed with hair. Hairs also in many species\r\nproject through apertures between the bony plates of the back. The bony\r\nplates are covered by a layer of horny epidermis. Teeth numerous,\r\nsimple, of persistent growth and usually without milk predecessors.\r\nZygomatic arch of skull complete. Cervical vertebrae with extremely\r\nshort, broad and depressed bodies; the first free, but the second and\r\nthird, and often several of the others united together both by their\r\nbodies and arches. Clavicles well developed. A third trochanter on the\r\nfemur. Tibia and fibula united at their lower extremities. Fore-feet\r\nwith strongly developed, curved claws, adapted for digging and\r\nscratching, three, four or five in number. Hind-feet plantigrade, with\r\nfive toes, all provided with nails. Tongue long, pointed and extensile,\r\nthough to a less degree than in the anteaters. Submaxillary glands\r\nlargely developed. Stomach simple. Placenta discoidal and deciduate.\r\n\r\nThe typical genus _Dasypus_, with several others, represents the\r\nsubfamily _Dasypodinae_, which usually have all five toes developed and\r\nwith nails, though the first and fifth may be suppressed. The first and\r\nsecond are long and slender, with the normal number and relative length\r\nof phalanges, the others stout, with short broad metacarpals, and the\r\nphalanges reduced in length and generally in number by coalescence; the\r\nterminal phalange of the third being large, that of the others gradually\r\ndiminishing to the fifth. _Dasypus_ has the most normal form of\r\nfore-foot, but the modifications developed in all the others\r\n(culminating in _Tolypeutes_) are foreshadowed. Ears wide apart. Teats,\r\none pair, pectoral. In _Dasypus_ the teeth are 9/10 or 8/9, of which the\r\nfirst in the upper jaw is usually implanted in the premaxillary bone.\r\nThe series extends posteriorly some distance behind the anterior root of\r\nthe zygoma, almost level with the hind edge of the palate. The teeth are\r\nlarge, subcylindrical, slightly compressed, diminishing in size towards\r\neach end of the series; the anterior two in the lower jaw smaller and\r\nmore compressed than the others. Cranial portion of the skull broad and\r\ndepressed, facial portion triangular, broad in front and depressed.\r\nAuditory bulla completely ossified, perforated on the inner side by the\r\ncarotid canal, and continued externally into an elongated bony meatus\r\nauditorius, with its aperture directed upwards and backwards. (In all\r\nthe other genera of _Dasypodinae_ the tympanic bone is a mere half-ring,\r\nloosely attached to the cranium.) Lower jaw with a high ascending\r\nbranch, broad transversely placed condyle, and high slender coronoid\r\nprocess. Vertebrae: C 7, D 11-12, L 3, S 8, Ca 17-18. Head broad and\r\nflat above, with the muzzle obtusely pointed. Ears of moderate size or\r\nrather small, placed laterally far apart. Body broad and depressed.\r\nArmour with six or seven movable bands between the scapular and pelvic\r\nshields. Tail shorter than the body, tapering, covered with plates\r\nforming distinct rings near the base. Fore-feet with five toes; the\r\nfirst much more slender than the others, and with a smaller ungual\r\nphalange and nail; the second, though the longest, also slender. The\r\nthird, fourth and fifth gradually diminishing in length, all armed with\r\nstrong, slightly curved compressed claws, sloping from an elevated,\r\nrounded inner border to a sharp, outer and inferior edge. The hind-foot\r\nis rather short, and has all five toes armed with stout, compressed,\r\nslightly curved, obtusely pointed claws--the third the longest, the\r\nsecond nearly equal to it, the fourth the next, the first and fifth\r\nshorter and nearly equal.\r\n\r\nTo this genus belongs one of the best-known species of the group, the\r\nsix-banded armadillo or encoubert (_D. sexcinctus_) of Brazil and\r\nParaguay; a very similar species, _D. villosus_, the hairy armadillo,\r\nreplacing it south of the Rio Plata. There are also two small species,\r\n_D. vellerosus_ and _D. minutus_, from the Argentine Republic and North\r\nPatagonia; the latter, which differs from the other three in having no\r\ntooth implanted in the premaxillary bone and is often referred to a\r\ngenus apart, as _Zaedius_.\r\n\r\nIn _Tatoua_ (_Cabassous_ or _Lysiurus_) the teeth are 9/9 or 8/8, of\r\nmoderate size and subcylindrical: the most posterior placed a little way\r\nbehind the anterior root of the zygoma, but far from the hinder margin\r\nof the palate. Skull somewhat elongated, much constricted behind the\r\norbits, and immediately in front of the constriction considerably\r\ndilated. Lower jaw slender, with the coronoid process small and sharp\r\npointed, sometimes obsolete. Vertebrae: C 7, D 12-13, L 5, S 10, Ca 18.\r\nHead broad behind. Ears rather large and rounded, wide apart. Movable\r\nbands of armour 12-13. Tail considerably shorter than the body, and\r\nslender, covered with nearly naked skin, with a few small, scattered,\r\nbony plates, chiefly on the under surface and near the apex. On the\r\nfore-feet the first and second toes are long and slender, with small\r\nclaws and the normal number of phalanges. The other toes have but two\r\nphalanges; the third has an immense sickle-like claw; the fourth and\r\nfifth similar but smaller claws. The hind-feet are comparatively small,\r\nwith five toes, and small, triangular, blunt nails; the third longest,\r\nthe first shortest. The best-known species of this genus, the tatouay or\r\ncabassou, _T. unicinctus_, is, after _Priodon gigas_, the largest of the\r\ngroup. It is found, though not abundantly, in Surinam, Brazil and\r\nParaguay. Others, such as _T. hispidus_ and _T. lugubris_, have been\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nIn the giant armadillo (_Priodon gigas_) the teeth are variable in\r\nnumber, and generally differ on the two sides of each jaw, being usually\r\nfrom 20 to 25 on each side above and below, so that as many as a hundred\r\nmay be present altogether; but as life advances the anterior teeth fall\r\nout, and all traces of their sockets disappear. The series extends as\r\nfar back as the hinder edge of the anterior root of the zygoma. They are\r\nall very small, in the anterior half of each series strongly compressed,\r\nwith flat sides and a straight free edge, but posteriorly more\r\ncylindrical, with flat, truncated, free surfaces. Vertebrae: C 7, D 12,\r\nL 3, S 10, Ca 23. Head small, elongated, conical. Ears moderate, ovate.\r\nArmour with 12-13 movable bands. Tail nearly equal to the body in\r\nlength, gradually tapering, closely covered with quadrangular scales,\r\narranged in a quincunx pattern. Fore-feet with five toes, formed on the\r\nsame plan as those of _Tatoua_, but with the claw of the third of still\r\ngreater size, and that of the others, especially the fifth,\r\nproportionally reduced. Hind-foot short and rounded, with five very\r\nshort toes, and short, broad, flat obtuse nails. The giant armadillo is\r\nby far the largest existing member of the family, measuring rather more\r\nthan 3 ft. from the tip of the nose to the root of the tail, the tail\r\nbeing about 20 in. long. It inhabits the forest of Surinam and Brazil.\r\nThe powerful claws of its fore-feet enable it to dig with great\r\nfacility; and its food consists chiefly of termites and other insects,\r\nalthough it is said to attack and uproot newly-made graves for the\r\npurpose of devouring the flesh of the bodies contained in them.\r\n\r\nThe apar (_Tolypeutes tricinctus_) typifies a genus in which the teeth\r\nare 9/9 or 8/9, and are rather large in proportion to the size of the\r\nskull, with the hinder end of the series reaching nearly to the\r\nposterior margin of the palate. Vertebrae: C 7, D 11, L 3, S 12, Ca 13.\r\nEars placed low on the sides of the head, rather large, broadly ovate.\r\nArmour with its scapular and pelvic shields very free at the sides of\r\nthe body, forming large chambers into which the limbs can be readily\r\nwithdrawn, and only three movable bands. Tail short, conical, covered\r\nwith large bony tubercles. The fore-feet formed on the same type as in\r\nthe last genus, but the peculiarities carried to a still greater extent.\r\nThe claw of the third toe is very long, while those of the first and\r\nfifth are greatly reduced and sometimes wanting. On the hind-foot the\r\nthree middle toes have broad, flat, subequal nails, forming together a\r\nkind of tripartite hoof; the first and fifth much shorter, with more\r\ncompressed nails.\r\n\r\nThe armadillos of this genus have the power of rolling themselves up\r\ninto a ball, the shield on the top of the head and the tuberculated\r\ndorsal surface of the tail exactly fitting into and filling up the\r\napertures left by the notches at either end of the body-armour. This\r\nappears to be their usual means of defence when frightened or surprised,\r\nas they do not burrow like the other species. They run very quickly,\r\nwith a very peculiar gait, only the tips of the claws of the fore-feet\r\ntouching the ground. In addition to the apar, there are the Argentine\r\nand Bolivian _T. conurus_, and _T. muriei_ from Argentina or Patagonia.\r\n\r\nThe last group of existing armadillos forms the genus _Tatusia_ and the\r\nsubfamily _Tatusiinae_; the subfamily rank being based on the fact that\r\nof the seven or eight pairs of small subcylindrical teeth, all but the\r\nlast, which is considerably smaller than the rest, are preceded by\r\nmilk-teeth not changed until the animal has nearly attained full size.\r\nVertebrae: C 7, D 9-11, L 5, S 8, Ca 20-27. Head narrow, with a long,\r\nnarrow, subcylindrical obliquely truncated snout. Ears rather large,\r\novate and erect, placed close together on the occiput. Armour with seven\r\nto nine distinct movable bands. Body generally elongated and narrow.\r\nTail moderate, or long, gradually tapering; its plates forming distinct\r\nrings for the greater part of its length. Fore-feet with four visible\r\ntoes, and a concealed clawless rudiment of the fifth; the claws long,\r\nslightly curved, and slender, the third and fourth subequal and alike,\r\nthe first and fourth much shorter. Hind-feet with five toes, armed with\r\nstrong, slightly curved, conical, obtusely pointed nails, and the third\r\nlongest, then the second and fourth, and the first and fifth much\r\nshorter than the others. This genus differs from all the other\r\narmadillos in having a pair of inguinal teats in addition to the usual\r\npectoral pair, and in producing a large number (4 to 10) of young at a\r\nbirth, all the others having usually but one or two. The peba armadillo,\r\n_T. septemcincta_, is a well-known species, having an extensive range\r\nfrom Texas to Paraguay. It is replaced in the more southern regions of\r\nSouth America by a smaller species, with shorter tail, the mulita (_T.\r\nhybrida_) so called from the resemblance of its head and ears to those\r\nof a mule. _T. kappleri_ is a large species from Guiana.\r\n\r\nFinally we have the pichiciago, or fairy armadillo, _Chlamydophorus\r\ntruncatus_, typifying the subfamily _Chlamydophorinae_. In most\r\nanatomical characters, especially the structure of the fore-foot, this\r\ngroup resembles the _Dasypodinae_, but it differs remarkably from all\r\nother known armadillos, living or extinct, in the peculiar modification\r\nof the armour.\r\n\r\nThe teeth, which number 8/(8-9), are subcylindrical, somewhat\r\ncompressed, moderate in size, and smaller at each end (especially in\r\nfront) than at the middle of the series. Skull broad and rounded behind,\r\npointed in front. Muzzle subcylindrical and depressed. A conspicuous\r\nrounded rough prominence on the frontal bone, just before each orbit.\r\nTympanic prolonged into a tubular auditory meatus, curving upwards round\r\nthe base of the zygoma. Vertebrae: C 7, D 11, L 3, S 10, Ca 15. Upper\r\npart of head and trunk covered with four-sided horny plates (with small\r\nthin ossifications beneath), forming a shield, free and overhanging the\r\nsides of the trunk, and attached only along the middle line of the back.\r\nThe plates are arranged in a series of distinct transverse bands, about\r\ntwenty in number between the occiput and the posterior truncated end,\r\nand not divided into solid scapular and pelvic shields with movable\r\nbands between. The hinder end of the body is abruptly truncated and\r\ncovered by a vertically placed, strong, solid, bony shield, of an oval\r\n(transversely extended) form, covered by thin horny plates. This shield\r\nis firmly welded by five bony processes to the hinder part of the\r\npelvis. Through a notch in the middle of its lower border the tail\r\npasses out. The latter is rather short, cylindrical in its proximal\r\nhalf, and expanded and depressed or spatulate in its terminal portion,\r\nand covered with horny plates. The dorsal surfaces of the fore and\r\nhind-feet are also covered with horny plates. The remainder of the limbs\r\nand under surface and sides of the body beneath the overlapping lateral\r\nparts of the back shield are clothed with rather long, soft silky hair.\r\nEyes and ears very small, and concealed by the hair. Extremities short.\r\nFeet large, each with five well-developed claws, those on the fore-feet\r\nvery long, stout and subcompressed, the structure of the digits being\r\nessentially the same as those of _Tatoua_ and _Priodon_. Teats two,\r\npectoral. Visceral anatomy closely resembling that of _Dasypus_, the\r\ncaecum being broad, short and bifid. The pichiciago, a burrowing animal,\r\nabout 5 in. long, inhabits the sandy plains of western Argentina,\r\nespecially the vicinity of Mendoza. Its horny covering is pinkish, and\r\nits silky hair white. A second species, _C. retusus_, from Bolivia is\r\nrather larger and has the dorsal shield attached to the skin of the back\r\nas far as its edge, instead of only along the median line. (See\r\nARMADILLO.)\r\n\r\n_Tubulidentata._--The second suborder of edentates, namely the\r\nTubulidentata, is represented at the present day only by the aard-varks,\r\nor ant-bears, of Africa, constituting the family _Orycteropodidae_ and\r\nthe genus _Orycteropus_. Together with the following group, they differ\r\nfrom the Xenarthra in the absence of additional articular facets to the\r\nlumbar vertebrae; for which reason the term Nomarthra has been proposed\r\nfor the Tubulidentata and Pholidota as collectively distinct from the\r\nXenarthra. In the present group the external surface is scantily covered\r\nwith bristle-like hairs. The teeth are numerous, and traversed by a\r\nnumber of parallel vertical pulp-canals. Femur with a third trochanter.\r\nFore-feet without the first toe, but all the other digits well\r\ndeveloped, with strong moderate-sized nails, suited to digging, the\r\nplantar surfaces of which rest on the ground in walking. Hind-feet with\r\nfive subequal toes. Placenta broadly zonular. The brain is very like\r\nthat of the Ungulata; and there are two pairs of teats, one abdominal,\r\nand the other inguinal. Aard-varks feed on animal substances; and are\r\nterrestrial and fossorial in habits. The total number of teeth is from\r\neight to ten in each side of the upper, and eight in the lower jaw; but\r\nthey are never all in place at one time, as the small anterior ones are\r\nshed before the series is completed behind. In the adult they number\r\nusually five on each side above and below, of which the first two are\r\nsimple and compressed, the next two larger and longitudinally grooved at\r\nthe sides, the most posterior simple and cylindrical. Their summits are\r\nrounded before they are worn; their bases do not taper to a root, but\r\nare evenly truncated and continually growing. Each tooth is made up of\r\nan aggregation of parallel dental systems, having a slender pulp cavity\r\nin the centre, from which the dentinal tubes radiate outwards, and being\r\nclosely packed together each system assumes a polygonal outline as seen\r\nin transverse section. A series of milk-teeth is developed. Skull\r\nmoderately elongated with the facial portion subcylindrical and slightly\r\ntapering, and the zygoma complete and slender. The palate ends\r\nposteriorly in the thickened transverse border of the palatines, and is\r\nnot continued back by the pterygoids. The tympanic is annular, and not\r\nwelded to the surrounding bones. The lower jaw is slender anteriorly,\r\nbut rises high posteriorly, with a slender recurved coronoid, and an\r\nascending pointed process on the hinder edge below the condyle, which is\r\nsmall, oval, and looks forward as much as upwards. Vertebrae: C 7, D 13,\r\nL 8, S 6, Ca 25. The large number of lumbar vertebrae is peculiar among\r\nEdentates. The tongue is less worm-like than in _Myrmecophaga_, being\r\nthick and fleshy at the base and gradually tapering to the apex. The\r\nsalivary apparatus is developed much in the same manner as in that\r\ngenus, but the duct of the submaxillary gland has no reservoir. The\r\nstomach consists of a large subglobular cardaic portion, with a thick,\r\nsoft, and corrugated lining membrane, and a smaller muscular, pyloric\r\npart, with a comparatively thin and smooth lining. There is a distinct\r\nileocaecal valve and a considerable sized caecum; also a gall-bladder.\r\nHead elongated, with a tubular snout, terminal nostrils and small\r\nmouth-opening. Ears large, pointed, erect. Tall nearly as long as the\r\nbody, cylindrical, thick at the base, tapering to the extremity.\r\n\r\nAccording to the researches of Dr E. Lonnberg, the teeth of the\r\naard-varks correspond only to the roots of those of other mammals, the\r\ncrowns being unrepresented, except to a very small degree when the teeth\r\nfirst cut the gum. This explanation renders the peculiar internal\r\nstructure of these teeth much less difficult to understand than if they\r\nrepresented both crown and root. In Dr Lonnberg's opinion, the teeth\r\nindicate the descent of the aard-vark from an ungulate stock,--a view in\r\nharmony with the evidence of the brain. If this idea prove well\r\nfounded, and if the aard-varks are rightly classed with the Edentata,\r\nthe whole order must apparently be regarded as an offshoot from\r\nprimitive Ungulata. The fact of the frequent distinctness of the\r\ncoracoid bone requires, however, explanation in connexion with such a\r\ndescent (see AARD-VARK).\r\n\r\n_Pholidota._--The Pholidota, constituting the third and last group of\r\nthe Edentata, are represented by the pangolins, or scaly anteaters, of\r\nAsia and Africa, all of which are included in the family _Manidae_ and\r\nthe genus _Manis_. Pangolins differ from all other mammals by the armour\r\nof overlapping horny scales (often with hairs growing between them)\r\nwhich invests the whole animal, with the exception of the under surface\r\nof the body, and sometimes a small patch near the tip of the under side\r\nof the tail. There are no teeth; and although the tongue is long and\r\nworm-like, it is not extensile. The scaphoid and lunar bones of the\r\ncarpus are united. The uterus is bicornuate, and the placenta diffused\r\nand non-deciduate. The skull has somewhat the form of an elongated cone,\r\nwith the small end turned forwards, and is smooth and free from crests\r\nand ridges. No distinction between the orbits and temporal fossae. The\r\nzygomatic arch usually incomplete, owing to the absence of the jugal\r\nbone; no distinct lacrymal bone; and the palate long and narrow. The\r\npterygoids extend backwards as far as the tympanics, but do not meet in\r\nthe middle line below. Tympanic welded to the surrounding bones, and\r\nmore or less bladder-like, but not produced into a tubular auditory\r\nmeatus. Two halves of lower jaw very slender and straight, without any\r\nangle or coronoid process, on the anterior extremity of the upper edge a\r\nsharp, conical, tooth-like process projecting upwards and outwards. No\r\nclavicles. No third trochanter to the femur. Terminal phalanges cleft at\r\nthe tip. Caudal vertebrae with very long transverse processes and\r\nnumerous chevron-bones. Stomach with thick muscular walls and lining\r\nmembrane, and a special gland near the middle of the great curvature,\r\nconsisting of a mass of complex secreting follicles, the ducts of which\r\nterminate in a common orifice. No caecum, but a gall-bladder. Head\r\nsmall, depressed, narrow, and pointed in front, with a very small\r\nmouth-opening. Eyes and ears very small. Body elongated, narrow. Tail\r\nmore or less elongated, convex above, flat underneath. Limbs short, and\r\nin walking the surface and outer sides of the phalanges of the two outer\r\ndigits of the front feet alone rest on the ground, with the points of\r\nthe nails turning upwards and inwards. The third toe the longest, with a\r\npowerful compressed curved claw, the second and fourth with similar but\r\nsmaller claws, but that of the first toe often almost rudimentary.\r\nHind-feet plantigrade with the first toe very short, and the four other\r\ntoes subequal, and carrying moderate, curved, compressed nails.\r\nPangolins are of small or moderate size, terrestrial and burrowing, and\r\nfeed mainly on termites or white ants; some of the species being more or\r\nless arboreal. They can roll themselves up in a ball when in danger.\r\nTheir peculiar elongated form, short limbs, long tapering tail, and\r\nscaly covering give them on a superficial inspection more the appearance\r\nof reptiles than of mammals. The species are not numerous and may be\r\ndivided into two sections, one comprising the Asiatic species, such as\r\n_M. javanica_, _M. aurita_ of China, and the Indian _M. pentadactyla_,\r\nand the other the African, as represented by the large _M. gigantea_,\r\n_M. temminchi_, the long-tailed _M. macrura_, and the small arboreal _M.\r\ntricuspis_. In the Asiatic group the middle series of scales continues\r\nto the tip of the tail; but in the African forms this row splits into\r\ntwo a few inches from the tail-tip. The latter have also no hairs\r\nbetween the scales and no external ears. The climbing species have a\r\nsmall bare patch on the under side of the tail near the tip (see\r\nPANGOLIN).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extinct Edentates._\r\n\r\nBeyond remains of species closely allied to or identical with the\r\nexisting forms, the sloths and anteaters appear to be unknown in a\r\nfossil state. On the other hand the extinct family of ground sloths, or\r\n_Megatheriidae_, which includes the largest of all edentates, is an\r\nexceedingly large one, and extends in South America from the Miocene to\r\nthe Pleistocene, and was also represented during the latter epoch in\r\nNorth America. It serves to connect the _Bradypodidae_ with\r\n_Myrmecophagidae_. The alleged occurrence of an allied form in\r\nMadagascar is somewhat doubtful (see MEGATHERIUM and MYLODON).\r\n\r\nOf _Dasypodidae_ numerous representatives occur in the South American\r\nTertiaries. From the higher beds many of the species are referable to\r\nexisting genera, such as _Dasypus_ and _Tatusia_, although some are much\r\nlarger than any living forms, the skull in one case being nearly a foot\r\nin length. In other instances, when lower formations are reached, the\r\ngenera are also distinct, _Eutatus_ having the whole armour divided into\r\nmovable bands, and the allied _Stegotherium_ representing the group in\r\nthe Santa Cruz formation of Patagonia. Even in the Argentine Pleistocene\r\nthere is an extinct genus, _Chlamydotherium_, represented by a species\r\nof the size of a rhinoceros, with grooved teeth approximating to those\r\nof the glyptodonts. The latter represent a family (_Glyptodontidae_) by\r\nthemselves, and typically may be described as giant solid-shelled\r\narmadillos, although some of their smaller Santa Cruz representatives\r\n(_Propalaeohoplophorus_) approximate in some degree to true armadillos\r\n(see GLYPTODON).\r\n\r\nA very remarkable Santa Cruz armadillo, _Peltephilus_, has an altogether\r\npeculiar type of head-shield, developed into horns in front of the eyes;\r\nand, what is still more noteworthy, teeth in the front of the jaws,\r\nthereby rendering the ordinary definition of the order Edentata\r\nincorrect. It has been made the type of a distinct family,\r\n_Peltephilidae_.\r\n\r\nThe past history of the armadillo group does not, however, by any means\r\nend here. True armadillos, it should be observed, are known in North\r\nAmerica as far north as Texas, from the Pleistocene onwards; but in\r\nformations of middle Tertiary age are unrepresented. Recent discoveries\r\napparently indicate, however, the occurrence of armadillos of a\r\nprimitive type in the lower Tertiary or Eocene formations of Wyoming.\r\nThe first evidence of these Eocene armadillos was afforded by portions\r\nof the jaws, which, together with a leg-bone of a totally different\r\nanimal, were believed to indicate creatures nearly allied to the aye-aye\r\n(_Chiromys_) of Madagascar, and for which the name _Metachiromys_ was\r\nconsequently proposed. According to modern usage, this name, in spite of\r\nits inappropriate nature, is retained for the armadillos, although in\r\nthe writer's opinion it ought to be replaced. According to Professor\r\nH.F. Osborn, by whom their remains have been described, the North\r\nAmerican fossil armadillos were closely related to the existing members\r\nof the group, from which they differ chiefly by the armour, or shield,\r\nhaving probably been formed of tough leathery skin instead of bony\r\nplates, by the presence of a single pair of large enamel-capped\r\ntusk-like teeth in each jaw, and by the degeneration of the other teeth.\r\nIf these determinations are trustworthy, the question arises whether we\r\nshould regard the armadillos of South America as the descendants of\r\nNorth American forms which migrated southwards before that separation of\r\nthe two continents was established, which lasted for a large portion of\r\nthe Tertiary period, or whether a migration took place at the same early\r\nepoch in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nMore interesting still is the occurrence of remains of reputed\r\narmadillos (_Necrodasypus_) from the Oligocene of France and Germany. In\r\nthe opinion of Dr F. Ameghino these Oligocene armadillos, which had bony\r\nshields on both the head and body, were near akin to some of the modern\r\nSouth American forms.\r\n\r\nPassing on to the aard-varks (_Orycteropodidae_), we find these\r\nrepresented by a species closely allied to the existing ones in the\r\nLower Pliocene formations of Spain, France, Hungary, Samos and Asia\r\nMinor. A single tibia from the French Oligocene is identified by Dr\r\nAmeghino with the present family, and the genus _Archaeorycteropus_\r\nestablished for its reception; this genus, in its founder's opinion,\r\nbeing also represented in the Santa Cruz beds of Patagonia. As regards\r\nthe pangolins, the only fossils referred to this group (apart from a few\r\ndiscovered in a cave in India) appear to be certain limb-bones from the\r\nOligocene of France and Germany, for which the names _Necromanis_ and\r\n_Teutomanis_ have been proposed. The occurrence of the characteristic\r\ncleft terminal toe-bones among these remains seems to leave little\r\ndoubt as to the correctness of the determination.\r\n\r\nThe alleged occurrence of remains of giant pangolins in the upper\r\nTertiary of Europe is due to misidentification (see ANCYLOPODA). By some\r\nauthorities the Eocene group of Ganodonta has been affiliated to the\r\nEdentata, but this reference is not accepted by Prof. W.B. Scott.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--The above article is to some extent based on the\r\n  articles by Sir W.H. Flower in the 9th edition of this work. See also\r\n  O.

L.*)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDENTON, a town and the county-seat of Chowan county, North Carolina,\r\nU.S.A., on Edenton Bay, an estuary of Albemarle sound, near the mouth of\r\nChowan river, in the N.E. part of the state. Pop. (1890) 2205; (1900)\r\n3046 (2090 negroes); (1910) 2789. It is served by the Norfolk & Southern\r\nrailway, and by the Albemarle Steam Navigation Co. In 1907 the former\r\nprojected a great bridge across Albemarle sound near the city. Edenton\r\nis an old and interesting town, has a number of fine old homesteads, and\r\nhas broad and well-shaded streets. Lumbering and the shad and herring\r\nfisheries are the most important industrial interests, and the town is a\r\nshipping point for fish, truck and other farm products, cotton and\r\npeanuts. There is a Fish Cultural Station here, established by the\r\nFederal government. The court-house was built about 1750.\r\n\r\nEdenton was settled about 1658, and was for some time known as the\r\n\"Towne on Queen Anne's Creek\" or the \"Port of Roanoke\"; in 1722 the\r\npresent name was adopted in honour of Governor Charles Eden (1673-1722),\r\nwhose grave is in St Paul's churchyard here. Throughout the 18th century\r\nEdenton was a place of considerable social and political importance; the\r\nlegislative assembly of North Carolina met here occasionally, and here\r\nlived the royal governors and various well-known citizens of the\r\nprovince, among them: Joseph Hewes (1730-1779), a signer of the\r\nDeclaration of Independence; James Iredell, Sr. (1750-1799), a\r\nFederalist leader and after 1790 a justice of the United States Supreme\r\nCourt, and his son James Iredell, Jr. (1788-1853), a prominent lawyer,\r\nfor many years a member of the state legislature, governor of North\r\nCarolina in 1827-1828, and a member of the United States Senate in\r\n1828-1831. Near Edenton lived Samuel Johnston (1733-1816), a prominent\r\nleader of the American Whigs preceding and during the War of American\r\nIndependence, a member of the Continental Congress in 1780-1782,\r\ngovernor of North Carolina in 1787-1789, and a Federalist member of the\r\nUnited States Senate in 1790-1793. In 1907 the Hewes, Iredell and\r\nJohnston homesteads were still standing. In a house facing the\r\ncourt-house green the famous \"Edenton Tea Party\" of fifty-one ladies met\r\non the 24th of October 1774 and signed resolutions that they would not\r\nconform \"to that Pernicious Custom of Drinking Tea\" and would not\r\n\"promote the wear of any manufacture from England\" until the tax on tea\r\nshould be repealed. Near Edenton the Confederate ram \"Albemarle,\" on\r\nemerging from the Roanoke river, was met by the Union \"double-enders,\"\r\n\"Sassacus,\" \"Mattabesett,\" and \"Miami,\" on the 5th of May 1864; the\r\nbattle, which resulted in favour of the Confederates, was a duel between\r\nthe Confederate ironclad and the Union wooden side-wheeler, the\r\n\"Sassacus,\" which rammed the \"Albemarle\" and had her bows, fitted with a\r\nthree-ton bronze beak, twisted off and carried away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDESSA (mod. _Vodena_), the ancient capital of Macedonia, previously\r\nknown as Aegae, situated 46 m. W. of Thessalonica on the banks of a\r\nbeautiful stream in the very centre of the kingdom, and at the head of a\r\ndefile commanding the approaches from the coast to the interior. It was\r\nthe original residence of the Macedonian kings; and even after the seat\r\nof government was removed by Philip II. to the more accessible Pella, it\r\ncontinued to be the burial-place of the royal family. At the celebration\r\nof his daughter's marriage here, Philip II. was murdered by Pausanias in\r\n336 B.C. His son Alexander was buried at Memphis through the contrivance\r\nof Ptolemy; but the bodies of his granddaughter Eurydice and her husband\r\nArrhidaeus were removed by Cassander to the ancestral sepulchre. On the\r\noccupation of the town by Pyrrhus the royal tombs were plundered by the\r\nGallic mercenaries. Owing to its position commanding the Via Egnatia,\r\nthe town retained its importance during the Roman and Byzantine periods.\r\nFor its present condition, see VODENA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDESSA, the Greek name of an ancient city of N.W. Mesopotamia (in 37 deg.\r\n21' N. lat. and 39 deg. 6' E. long.), suggested perhaps by a comparison of\r\nits site, or its water supply,[1] with that of its Macedonian namesake.\r\nIt still bears its earlier name, modified since the 15th century (by the\r\nTurks?) to Urfa.\r\n\r\n  The oldest certain form is the Aramaic _Urhai_ (\"Western\"\r\n  pronunciation _Urhoi_), which appears in Greek as an adjective as\r\n  [Greek: Horrhoenhe][2], [Greek: -noi][3] (perhaps also as a fortress\r\n  with spring, as [Greek: Orrha]),[4] and in Latin as Orr(h)ei,[5] and\r\n  (in the inscription on Abgar's grave) _Orrhenoru(m)_.[6] The Syriac\r\n  Chronicle ascribed to Dionysius of Tell-mahre derives the name from a\r\n  first king Urhai, son of Hewya, whom Procopius (_De bello persico_, i.\r\n  17) calls Osroes (cf. below), connected by Bayer[7] with Chosroes,[8]\r\n  from which G. Hoffmann would also derive the Syriac Urhai (_Z.D.M.G._\r\n  xxxii. 742). The Syriac town name has, however, the form of an ethnic,\r\n  and we may therefore with Duval leave it unexplained (_Hist._ 22). The\r\n  fact that the Arabic name is Ruha supports the hint of the\r\n  Graeco-Latin forms that there was a vowel between the R and the H.\r\n  There is little plausibility in the suggestion of Assemani and others\r\n  that Ruha comes from [Greek: rhoe] of Callirrhoe. A gentilic of the\r\n  form Ru-u-ai occurs in a letter (of an Assyrian king?) to chiefs in a\r\n  (Babylonian?) town as the designation of three captives (Harper, _Ass.\r\n  and Bab. Letters_, No. 287 [= K 94], line 6; cf. Bezold, _Die\r\n  Achamenideninschriften_, p. xii.), who have Semitic names; and\r\n  Ru-'-u-a is the name of an Aramaic people mentioned with other\r\n  Aramaeans by Tiglath-pileser IV., Sargon and Sennacherib. It is not\r\n  impossible that some such people may have settled at Urhai and given\r\n  it their name, although the Ru-'-u-a are always mentioned in\r\n  connexions that imply seats near the Persian Gulf.[9] The district\r\n  name Osroene for [Greek: Orrhoenhe], is Greek, perhaps due to analogy\r\n  of Chosroes. It occurs but rarely in Syriac (Uzroina); e.g. Chronicle\r\n  of Edessa. S 35;[10] elsewhere Beth-Urhaye (e.g. Cureton, _Spicileg.\r\n  Syr._ 20). In the time of Tiglath-pileser I. (c. 1100 B.C.) the name\r\n  seems to have been \"District of (not Edessa, but) Harran\" (Annals, vi.\r\n  71). The Arabs pronounced the name er-Ruha (see above), and that form\r\n  prevailed till it gave place to Urfa in the 15th century.\r\n\r\n  The Greek name Edessa appears in the Jerusalem Targum to Gen. x. 10 as\r\n  Hadas ([Hebrew: hadas], myrtle); it has been proposed (cf. Duval,\r\n  _Hist. d'Edesse_, 23) to derive Edessa from Aram. [Hebrew: hadat], as\r\n  though = Carthage, New Town; but Syriac writers, when they\r\n  occasionally [11] use the name (Edessa, [Hebrew: adasa]; so Yaqut,\r\n  Adasa), show no suspicion of its being Semitic. According to Pliny, v.\r\n  86, Edessa was also called Antioch, and coins of Antiochus IV.\r\n  Epiphanes with the legend \"Antioch on the Callirrhoe\" may imply that\r\n  he rebuilt and renamed the place (so Ed. Meyer in Pauly-Wissowa,\r\n  _Realencyclopadie_, col. 1933, 66; otherwise Duval, _Hist._ 23; cf.\r\n  art. OSROENE). Pliny indeed seems to call the city itself Callirrhoe,\r\n  and S. Funk finds it so named in the Talmud (_Bab. Mez._, 18a [Hebrew:\r\n  raal raham bahara shuiar meta]: _Die Juden in Babylonien 200-500_, ii.\r\n  148; 1908); but K. Regling (_Klio_, i. 459 n. 1) may be right in his\r\n  emendation which applies the title in Pliny to the sacred spring.\r\n\r\n_History: Pre-Hellenistic._--Until excavation gives us more definite\r\ndata we can only infer from its position on one of the main\r\nthoroughfares between the Mediterranean and the East (see MESOPOTAMIA)\r\nthat Urhai-Edessa, possibly bearing some other name, was already a town\r\nof some importance in the early Babylonian-Assyrian age. Whatever may\r\nhave been the ethnographical type of the early inhabitants, it must by\r\nthe beginning of the second last millennium B.C. have included Hittites\r\nin the large sense of the term, probably Aryans, and certainly Semites\r\nof some of the types characteristic of early Assyrian history. Most\r\nprobably its people belonged to the domain of the then more famous\r\nHarran-Carrhae, between which and Samosata (on the Euphrates) Urhai lies\r\nmidway (some 25-30 m. distant from each) in the district watered by the\r\nBalih. Although at Edessa itself no cuneiform documents have yet been\r\nfound, a little more than four hours journey eastwards, at Anaz (=\r\nGullab?) = Dur of Tiglath-pileser IV. was found in 1901 a slab with a\r\nbas-relief and an inscription; and 15-20 min. W. of Eski-Harran, in 1906\r\na very interesting 6th-century Assyrian inscription (see MESOPOTAMIA).\r\n\r\nIn the later Assyrian empire the population was largely\r\nAramaic-speaking; but S. Schiffer's theory (Beiheft I. zur\r\n_Orientalistischen Litteratur-Zeitung_) finds contemporary evidence of\r\nIsraelites settled in the neighbourhood of Edessa in the second half of\r\nthe 7th century B.C. At the fall of Nineveh many towns in Mesopotamia\r\nsuffered severely at the hands of the Medes. The period remains dark,\r\nnotwithstanding the obscure light that has been thrown on it lately\r\n(Pognon, _Inscriptions_). When Aramaic began to take the place of\r\nAssyrian in written documents is not known; but just across the\r\nEuphrates the change had occurred as early as the 8th century B.C.\r\n(Zengirli, Hamath; see also Pognon). Certain it is that the earliest\r\ndocuments that have survived in Syriac, or Edessene Aramaic, do not\r\nrepresent an experimental stage. Moreover, although the Syriac of the\r\nStory of Ahiqar is of a late type, the sources of the story, traces of\r\nwhich are to be found in the Hebrew Tobit (q.v.), go back to the\r\npre-Hellenistic period.\r\n\r\n_Graeco-Roman Times._--According to a credible tradition found in\r\nEusebius (_Excerpta_, 179), the Syriac Chronicle ascribed to Dionysius\r\nof Tell-mahre (Tullberg, 61), and elsewhere, Urhai was renovated, like\r\nother Mesopotamian sites, in 304 B.C. by Seleucus I. Nicator, who gave\r\nit its Greek name.[12] It would share in the Hellenistic culture of\r\nSyria, although the language of the common people would continue to be\r\nAramaic (E.R. Bevan, _House of Seleucus_, i. 227 f. with reff.). With\r\nthe decay of the Seleucid power, weakened by Rome and Parthia, the old\r\ninflux from the desert would recommence, and an Arabic element begin to\r\nshow. Von Gutschmid (_Untersuch._, cf. Duval, ch. iii. end) argues\r\nplausibly that it was in 132 B.C., in the reign of Antiochus VII.\r\nSidetes, that Edessa became the seat of a dynasty of some thirty local\r\nkings, whose succession has been preserved in native sources. The name\r\nof the first king, however, appears in different forms (cf. above), and\r\none (Osroes-Orhai) is so like that of the town that Ed. Meyer suspects\r\nthe historicity of the first reign, of five years. The names of the\r\nother kings--Abgar, Ma'nu, Bekr, &c.--are for the most part Arabic, as\r\nthe people (in whose inscriptions the same mixture of names occurs) are\r\ncalled by classical authors; but the rulers, among whom an occasional\r\nIranian name betrays the influence of the dominant Parthians,[13] would\r\nhardly maintain their distinctness from the Aramaic populace. This state\r\nwhich lasted for three centuries and a half, naturally varied in\r\nextent.[14] Bounded on the W. and the N. by the Euphrates, it reached at\r\nits widest as far as the Tigris. At such times, therefore, it included\r\nsuch towns as Harran (Carrhae), Nisibis, Sarug, Zeugma-Birejik, Resaena,\r\nSingara, Tigranocerta, Samosata, Melitene. Its position \"on the\r\ndangerous verge of two contending empires,\" Parthia and Rome,\r\ndetermined its changeful fortunes. Parthian predominance yielded for a\r\ntime to Armenian (Tigranes, 88-86 B.C.). Then, at the time of the\r\nexpeditions of Lucullus, Pompey and Crassus, Edessa was an ally of Rome,\r\nthough Abgar II. Ariamnes (68-53) played an ambiguous part. In A.D. 114\r\nAbgar VII. entertained Trajan on his way back to Syria (Dio Cass. xviii.\r\n21); but in 116, in consequence of a general rising, his consul L.\r\nQuietus sacked the city, Abgar perhaps dying in the flames, and made the\r\nstate tributary. Hadrian, however, abandoning Trajan's forward policy in\r\nfavour of a Euphrates boundary, restored it as a dependency of Rome.\r\nWhen L. Verus (163-165) recovered Mesopotamia from Parthia, it was not\r\nEdessa but Harran that was chosen as the site of a Roman colony, and\r\nmade the metropolis by Marcus Aurelius (172).\r\n\r\nTo one of the native kings doubtless is to be ascribed the Syriac\r\ninscription[15] on one of the pair of pillars, 50 ft. high, which stood,\r\nno doubt, in front of a temple connected with some local cult.\r\nTrustworthy data for determining its nature are lacking. One or both of\r\nthe pools below the citadel containing sacred fish may have been sacred\r\nto Atargatis (q.v.), an Ishtar-Venus deity; and according to the\r\n_Doctrine of Addai_, alongside of Venus were worshipped the sun and the\r\nmoon.[16] Nergal and Sin were known as \"twins,\" and connected with the\r\nsign Gemini, under the name _ellamme_, \"the youths\" (cf. Zimmern,\r\n_K.A.T._ 363). This makes more plausible than it otherwise would be the\r\nsuggestion of J. Rendel Harris that the great twin pillars were\r\nconnected with the cult of the Dioscuri, and that in the Acts of Thomas\r\nis to be seen a later attempt to substitute other \"twins,\" viz. Jesus\r\nand Judas-Thomas (Addai), whom legend buried \"in Britio Edessenorum\"\r\n(explained by Harnack as the Edessan citadel: Aram. _birtha_).[17]\r\n\r\nWhether it was at Edessa that a Jewish translation of the Old Testament\r\ninto Syriac was made,[18] under the encouragement perhaps of the favour\r\nof the royal house of Adiabene (Josephus, _Bell. Jud._ ii. 19. 4), or\r\nwhether that work was done _in_ Adiabene,[19] cannot be discussed here.\r\nThat the translation did not share the fate of the other non-Christian\r\nSyriac writings, which did not survive the 13th century (see SYRIAC\r\nLITERATURE), is due to the fact that it was adopted (after being\r\nrevised) by the Christians, and thus rescued. Although the beginnings of\r\nChristianity at Edessa are enshrouded in the mists of legend, and the\r\nfirst mention of Christian communities in Osrhoene and the towns there\r\nis connected with the part they played in the paschal controversy (c.\r\nA.D. 192), it has been reasonably urged that the legends imply a fact,\r\nnamely that Christianity began in the Jewish colony, perhaps by the\r\nmiddle of the 2nd century, although the earliest seat of the Syrian\r\nchurch may have been farther east, in Adiabene.[20] Parts of the New\r\nTestament were certainly translated into Syriac in the 2nd century,\r\nalthough whether the \"Old Syriac\" (so e.g. Hjelt) or the Diatessaron (so\r\nBurkitt) came first is uncertain. About the end of the 2nd century\r\nEdessene Christianity seems to have made a fresh beginning: the\r\nordination of Palut by Serapion of Antioch may mean that things\r\necclesiastical took a westward trend, and it is possible (so Burkitt)\r\nthat the \"Old Syriac\" New Testament version was now introduced. A strong\r\nman offered himself in Bardaisan (q.v.; Bardesanes), to whom perhaps we\r\nowe the finest Syriac poem extant, the \"Hymn of the Soul,\" though\r\northodoxy rejected him. He was a contemporary of Abgar IX., at whose\r\ncourt Julius Africanus stayed for a while. A Syrian official record from\r\nthis reign, preserved in the _Edessene Chronicle_, gives a somewhat\r\ndetailed account of a violent flood (autumn, 201) of the Daisan river\r\nwhich did much damage, destroying amongst other things \"the palace of\r\nAbgar the Great,\" rebuilt as a summer palace by Abgar IX., and \"the\r\ntemple of the church of the Christians.\" The form of this last statement\r\nshows that at the time of writing (206) the rulers had not adopted\r\nChristianity themselves. Abgar IX. is now commonly supposed to be the\r\nruler to whom the famous legend was first attached (see ABGAR); but\r\nthough he visited Rome there is no proof that he ever became a Christian\r\n(Gomperz, in _Archaologisch-epigraphische Mitteilungen aus\r\nOsterreich-Ungarn_, xix. 154-157). It was at Edessa that Caracalla, who\r\nmade it a military colony under the style of Colonia Marcia Edessenorum,\r\nspent the winter of 216-217, and near there that he was murdered. The\r\nreligious philosophical treatise preserved under the title of _Book of\r\nthe Laws of the Lands_ was probably produced at this time by a pupil of\r\nBardesanes, and the _Acts of Thomas_ in its original form may have\r\nfollowed not long after.\r\n\r\n_Sassanian Period._--In 226 the Parthian empire gave place to the new\r\nkingdom of the Sassanidae, whose claim to the ancient Achaemenian empire\r\nled to constant struggle with Rome in which Edessa naturally suffered.\r\nThe native state was restored by Gordian in 242; but in 244 it became\r\nagain directly subject to Rome. The Edessan martyrs Sharbel and\r\nBarsamya, whose \"Acts\" in legendary form have come down to us, may have\r\nperished in the Decian persecution. In 260 the city was besieged by the\r\nPersians under Shapur I., and Valerian was defeated and made prisoner by\r\nits gates. Odaenathus of Palmyra (d. 267), however, wrested Mesopotamia\r\nfrom the Persians; but Aurelian defeated his successor Zenobia at Emesa\r\n(273), and Carus, who died in 283 in an expedition against the Persians,\r\nand Galerius (297) carried the frontier again to the Tigris.\r\nDiocletian's persecution secured the martyr's crown for the Edessenes\r\nShamona, Guria (297), and Habbib (309), and shortly thereafter Lucian\r\n\"the martyr,\" who though born at Samosata received his training at\r\nEdessa; but the bishop Qona, who laid the foundations of \"the great\r\nchurch\" by the sacred pool, somehow escaped. Edessa can claim no share\r\nin \"the Persian Sage\" Aphrahat or Afrahat (Aphraates); but Ephraem,\r\nafter bewailing in Nisibis the sufferings of the great Persian war under\r\nConstantius and Julian, when Jovian in 363 ceded most of Mesopotamia to\r\nShapur II., the persecutor of the Christians, settled in Edessa, which\r\nas the seat of his famous school (called \"the Persian\") grew greatly in\r\nimportance, and attracted scholars from all directions. He taught and\r\nwrote vigorously against the Arians and other heretics, and although\r\njust after his death (373) the emperor Valens banished the orthodox from\r\nEdessa, they returned on the emperor's death in 378. Under Zenobius,\r\ndisciple of Ephraem, studied the voluminous writer, Isaac of Antioch (d.\r\ncirc. 460). Rabbula perhaps owed his elevation to the see of Edessa\r\n(411-435), in the year which produced the oldest dated Syriac MS., to\r\nhis asceticism, and it was to his time that the sojourn there of the\r\n\"Man of God\" (Alexis) was assigned; but he won from the Nestorians the\r\ntitle of the Tyrant of Edessa. In particular he exerted himself to stamp\r\nout the use of the Diatessaron in favour of the four Gospels, the Syriac\r\nversion of which probably now took the form known as the Peshitta. When\r\nthe popular Nestorianism of the Syrians was condemned at Ephesus (431)\r\nit began to gravitate eastwards, Nisibis becoming its eventual\r\nheadquarters; but Edessa and the western Syrians refused to bow to the\r\nCouncil of Chalcedon (451) when it condemned Monophysitism. In and\r\naround Edessa the theological strife raged hotly.[21] When, however,\r\nZeno's edict (489) ordered the closing of the school of the Persians at\r\nEdessa, East and West drifted apart more and more; the ecclesiastical\r\nwriter Narsai, \"the Harp of the Holy Spirit,\" fled to Nisibis about 489.\r\nTill about this time Syriac influence was strong in Armenia, and some\r\nSyriac works have survived only in Armenian translations. In the opening\r\nyears of the 6th century the Persian-Roman War (502-506) found a\r\nchronicler in the anonymous Edessene history known till recently as the\r\nChronicle of Joshua Stylites. Whether Edessa received from the emperor\r\nJustin I. the additional name of Justinopolis may be uncertain (see\r\nHallier, _op. cit._ p. 128); but it seems to have been renewed and\r\nfortified after the \"fourth\" flood in 525 (Procop. _Pers._ ii. 27; _De\r\naedific._ ii. 7). About this time, according to Noldeke, an anonymous\r\nEdessene wrote the Romance of Julian the Apostate, which so many Arab\r\nwriters use as a history. Chosroes I. Anushirwan succeeded in 540,\r\naccording to the last entry in the Edessene Chronicle, in exacting a\r\nlarge tribute from Edessa; but in 544 he besieged it in vain. A few\r\nyears later Jacob Baradaeus, with Edessa as centre of his bishopric, was\r\ncarrying on the propaganda of Monophysitism which won for the adherents\r\nof that creed the name of Jacobites (q.v.). The valuable Syriac\r\nChronicle just referred to probably was compiled in the latter half of\r\nthis century.\r\n\r\n_Islam._--In the first decade of the next century Edessa was taken by\r\nChosroes II., and a large part of the population transported to eastern\r\nPersia. Within a score of years it was recovered by the emperor\r\nHeraclius, who reviewed a large army under its walls. The prophet of\r\nIslam was now, however, building up his power in Arabia, and although\r\nHeraclius paid no heed to the letter demanding his adhesion which he\r\nreceived from Medina (628), and the deputation of fifteen Rahawiyin who\r\npaid homage in 630 were not Edessenes but South Arabians, a few years\r\nlater (636?) Heraclius's attempts, from Edessa as a centre, to effect an\r\norganized opposition to the victorious Arabs were defeated by Sa'd, and\r\nhe fell back on Samosata. The terms on which Edessa definitely passed\r\ninto the hands of the Moslems (638) under Riyad are not certain\r\n(Baladhuri). As it now ceased to be a frontier city it lost in\r\nimportance. In 668 occurred another destructive flood (Theophanes, p.\r\n537), and in 678 an earthquake which destroyed part of the \"old church,\"\r\nwhich the caliph Mo'awiya I. is said to have repaired. To the latter\r\npart of the century belongs the activity of Edessa's bishop Jacob, whose\r\nchronicle is unfortunately lost. It may have been the impulse given by\r\nthe final supremacy of the caliphate to the long process which\r\neventually substituted a new branch of Semitic speech for the Aramaic\r\n(which had now prevailed for a millennium and a half), that led Jacob to\r\nadopt the Greek vowel signs for use in Syriac. A century later\r\nTheophilus of Edessa (d. 785), author of a lost history, translated into\r\nSyriac \"the two books of the poet Homer on the Conquest of the city of\r\nIlion.\" When the Bagdad caliphs lost control of their dominions, Edessa\r\nshared the fortunes of western Mesopotamia, changing with the rise and\r\nfall of Egyptian dynasties and Arab chieftains. In the 10th century\r\nal-Mas'udi, writing in the very year in which it happened, tells how the\r\nMahommedan ruler of Edessa, with the permission of the caliph, purchased\r\npeace of the emperor Romanus Lecapenus by surrendering to him the napkin\r\nof Jesus of Nazareth, wherewith he had dried himself after his baptism.\r\nThe translation of the Holy Icon of Christ from Edessa is commemorated\r\non the 16th of August (Cal. Byzant). A few years later Ibn Haukal (978)\r\nestimates the number of churches in the city at more than 300, and\r\nal-Mokaddasi (985) describes its cathedral, with vaulted ceiling covered\r\nwith mosaics, as one of the four wonders of the world. In 1031 the\r\nemperor recovered Edessa; but in 1040 it fell into the hands of the\r\nSeljuks, whose progress had added a large element of Armenian refugees\r\nto the population of Osrhoene. There is no reason, therefore, to\r\ndiscredit Maqrizi's statement that it was three brother architects from\r\nEdessa that the Armenian minister Badr al-Gamali employed to build three\r\nof the fine city gates of Cairo (1087-1091). The empire soon recovered\r\nEdessa, but the resident made himself independent. Thoros applied for\r\nhelp to Baldwin, brother and successor of Godfrey of Bouillon in the\r\nFirst Crusade, who in 1098 took possession of the town and made it the\r\ncapital of a Burgundian countship, which included Samosata and Sarug',\r\nand was for half a century the eastern bulwark of the kingdom of\r\nJerusalem.[22] The local Armenian historian, however, Matthew of Edessa,\r\ntells of oppression, decrease of population, ruin of churches, neglect\r\nof agriculture. With the campaign of Maudud in 1110 fortune began to\r\nfavour the Moslems. Edessa had to endure siege after siege. Finally, in\r\n1144 it was stormed, Matthew being among the slain, by 'Imad ud-Din\r\nZengi, ruler of Mosul, under Joscelin II., an achievement celebrated as\r\n\"the conquest of conquests,\" for laying the responsibility of which not\r\non God but on the absence of the Frankish troops, an Edessan monk, John,\r\nbishop of Harran (d. 1165), brought down upon himself the whole bench of\r\nbishops. Edessa suffered still more in 1146 after an attempt to recover\r\nit. Churches were now turned into mosques. The consternation produced in\r\nEurope by the news of its fate led to \"the Second Crusade.\" In 1182 it\r\nfell to Saladin, whose nephew recovered it when it had temporarily\r\npassed (1234) to the sultan of Rum; but the \"Eye of Mesopotamia\" never\r\nrecovered the brilliance of earlier days. The names it contributed to\r\nArabic literature are unimportant. By timely surrender (1268) it escaped\r\nthe sufferings inflicted by Hulaku and his Monguls on Saru'g\r\n(Barhebraeus, _Chron. Arab._, Beirut ed., 486). Mostaufi describes a\r\ngreat cupola of finely worked stone still standing by a court over a\r\nhundred yards square (1340). Ali b. Yazd in his account of the campaigns\r\nof Timur, who reduced Mesopotamia in 1393, still calls the city (1425)\r\nRuha. In 1637, when Amurath IV. conquered Bagdad and annexed\r\nMesopotamia, it passed finally into the hands of the Turks, by whom it\r\nis called Urfa.\r\n\r\n_The Modern Town._--Urfa lies north-east of the Nimrud Dagh. It is\r\nsurrounded by a wall, strengthened by square towers at distances of\r\n18-20 steps, probably dating in its present condition from medieval\r\nMahommedan times. On a height in a corner towards the west, overtopping\r\nthe town by 100-200 ft., are the remains of the old citadel, and the two\r\nfamous Corinthian columns[23] known as \"the Throne of Nimrud.\" In the\r\nhollow between this height and the town rise two springs which form\r\nponds, the farther removed of which from the citadel is known as Birket\r\nal-Khalil, doubtless the Callirrhoe of the classical writers, and\r\ncontains the sacred fish, estimated by J.S. Buckingham at 20,000, and\r\nthe nearer as 'Ain Zalkha (i.e. Zuleikha, the wife of Potiphar). On the\r\nnorth edge of the Birket al-Khalil (see plan in Sachau, p. 197) is the\r\ngreat mosque of Abraham, the interior of which is described by J.S.\r\nBuckingham (_Travels_, pp. 108-110). Diagonally opposite the mosque is a\r\nhouse with a square tower, which is locally believed to occupy the place\r\nof the famous ancient school. The waters of the two pools make their way\r\nin a single stream southwards out of the town. The once dangerous stream\r\nDaisan ([Greek: Skirtos]) no longer flows southwards through the town,\r\nbut encircles it on the north and east in the channel of the old moat.\r\nThis stream, now called Kara Kuyun, and the other are exhausted in the\r\nirrigation of the gardens lying south-east of the town, except when\r\nfuller than usual, when they reach the Balih. Not far east of the sacred\r\npool is the largest building in the town, the recent Armenian Gregorian\r\ncathedral, whose American bells were first heard during Sachau's visit\r\nin 1879. About the middle of the town is the largest mosque, Ulu 'Gami\r\n(parts of it probably pre-Islamic), which probably occupies the site of\r\nthe Christian church reckoned by the early Mahommedan writers as one of\r\nthe wonders of the world. In the bazaar, which lies between the chief\r\nmosque and the sacred pool, and contains several streets, are displayed\r\nnot only the native woollen stuffs, pottery and silver work, but also a\r\nconsiderable variety of European goods, especially cloth stuffs. The\r\nprincipal manufactures are fine cotton stuffs and yellow leather. The\r\nstreets are of course narrow and winding; but the houses are well built\r\nof stone. The outskirts are occupied by melon gardens, vineyards and\r\nmulberry plantations. The fertile plain south of the town is noted for\r\nits wheat and fine pasture. The climate is healthy except in summer; the\r\n\"Aleppo button\" (see BAGDAD, vilayet), a painful boil, is common. The\r\nrocky heights south and west of the town, whence the building material\r\nis largely obtained, are full of natural and artificial caverns, once\r\nused as dwellings, cloisters and graves, where are most of the\r\ninscriptions published by Sachau, who also visited and describes (pp.\r\n204-206) the Der Ya'qub, nearly two hours distant.\r\n\r\nUrfa is the capital of a sanjak of the same name, in the vilayet of\r\nAleppo. The population was estimated by Olivier in 1796 at 20,000 to\r\n24,000, by Buckingham at 50,000, by Chernik in 1873 at 40,000, by Sachau\r\nin 1879 at 50,000, in Baedeker's Handbook in 1906 at 30,000. Vice-Consul\r\nFitzmaurice said that before December 1895 it was close on 65,000, of\r\nwhom about 20,000 were Armenian, 3000 or 4000 Jacobites,\r\nSyrian-Catholic, Greek-Catholic, Maronites and Jews, and the remaining\r\n40,000 Turkish, Kurdian and Arab Mahommedans. Two barbarous massacres\r\noccurred on the 28th and 29th of October and the 28th and 29th of\r\nDecember 1895; 126 Armenian families were absolutely wiped out. He\r\nbelieves that 8000 Armenians perished in the second massacre. The\r\nDeutsche Orient-Mission has its chief seat in Urfa, and there have for\r\nyears been American and French missions. The Germans have an orphanage\r\nwith 300 Armenian children, a carpet factory and a medical station. The\r\nAmerican school had some years ago 250 pupils.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--Inscriptional: H.

S.S.E. of Cairo by\r\nrail, on the W. bank of the Nile, the railway station being on the\r\nopposite side of the river. Pop. (1907) 19,262. The inhabitants\r\nmanufacture earthenware, which finds ready sale all through Egypt. The\r\nancient Atbo (_Apollinopolis Magna_) was capital of the second nome of\r\nUpper Egypt. The great sandstone temple is practically complete (see\r\nARCHITECTURE: _Egypt_). It was built on the site of an earlier structure\r\nentirely in the time of the Ptolemies. The central part of the building,\r\nbegun by Ptolemy III. Euergetes in 237 B.C., was finished by his\r\nsuccessor in 212; the portico, court, pylons and surrounding wall were\r\nadded by Ptolemy Euergetes II., Soter II. and Alexander I.; but the\r\ndecoration was not finished till 57 B.C. in the reign of Ptolemy XIII.\r\nNeos Dionysus. The god of Atbo was a form of Horus (Apollo) as the\r\nsun-god; his most characteristic representation is as the disk of the\r\nsun with outspread wings, so often seen over the doors of shrines, at\r\nthe top of stelae, &c. In the temple, where he is often figured as a\r\nfalcon-headed man, he is associated with Hathor of Dendera and the child\r\nHarsemteus.\r\n\r\n  See Baedeker's _Egypt_; Ed. Naville, _Textes relatifs au mythe d'Horus\r\n  recueillis dans le temple d'Edfou_.     (F. Ll. G.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDGAR (EADGAR), king of the English (944-975), was the younger son of\r\nEdmund the Magnificent and Aelfgifu. As early as 955 he signed a charter\r\nof his uncle Eadred, and in 957 the Mercian nobles, discontented with\r\nthe rule of his elder brother Eadwig, made him king of England north of\r\nthe Thames. On the death of his brother in October 959 Edgar became king\r\nof a united England. Immediately on his accession to the throne of\r\nMercia Edgar recalled St Dunstan from exile and bestowed on him first\r\nthe bishopric of Worcester, and then that of London. In 961 Dunstan was\r\ntranslated to Canterbury, and throughout Edgar's reign he was his chief\r\nadviser, and to him must be attributed much of the peace and prosperity\r\nof this time.\r\n\r\nThe reign of Edgar was somewhat uneventful, but two things stand out\r\nclearly: his ecclesiastical policy and his imperial position in Britain.\r\nEdgar and Dunstan were alike determined to reform the great monastic\r\nhouses, and to secure that they should be restored once more to their\r\ntrue owners and not remain in the hands of the secular priests or\r\n_canonici_, whose life and discipline alike seem to have been extremely\r\nlax. In this reform Edgar was helped not only by St Dunstan but also by\r\nOswald of Worcester and Aethelwold of Winchester. The priests of the old\r\nand new monasteries at Winchester, at Chertsey and at Milton Abbas were\r\nreplaced by monks, and in monastic discipline the old rule of St\r\nBenedict was restored in all its strictness.\r\n\r\nThe coronation of Edgar was, for some unexplained reason, delayed till\r\nthe Whitsunday of 973. It took place with much ceremony at Bath, and was\r\nfollowed shortly after by a general submission to Edgar at Chester. Six,\r\nor (according to later chroniclers) eight kings, including the kings of\r\nScotland and Strathclyde, plighted their faith that they would be the\r\nking's fellow-workers on sea and land. The historical truth of this\r\nstory has been much questioned; there seems to be little doubt that it\r\nis true in its main outlines, though we need not accept the details\r\nabout Edgar's having been rowed on the Dee by eight kings.\r\n\r\nTwo isolated and unexplained incidents are also recorded in the\r\nchronicle: first, the ravaging of Westmorland by the Scandinavian\r\nThored, son of Gunnere, in 967; and second, the ravaging of Thanet by\r\nEdgar's own command in 970.\r\n\r\nEdgar's death took place in the year 975, and he was buried at\r\nGlastonbury. By his vigorous rule and his statesmanlike policy Edgar won\r\nthe approval of his people, and in the Saxon chronicle we have poems\r\ncommemorating his coronation and death, and describing his general\r\ncharacter. The only fault ascribed to him is a too great love for\r\nforeigners and for foreign customs. Edgar strengthened the hands of the\r\nprovincial administration, and to him has been attributed the\r\nreorganization of the English fleet. The characteristic feature of his\r\nrule was his love of peace, and by efficient administration he secured\r\nit.\r\n\r\nEdgar formed an irregular union in 961 with Wulfthryth, an inmate of the\r\nconvent at Wilton, who bore him a daughter Eadgyth. He next married\r\nAethelflaed, \"the white duck,\" daughter of Earl Ordmaer, who bore him a\r\nson, afterwards known as Edward the Martyr. Finally he was united to\r\nAelfthryth, daughter of Earl Ordgar, who became the mother of the\r\nAetheling Edmund (d. 971) and of Aethelred the Unready.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--_Saxon Chronicle_ (ed.

Mw.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDGAR, or EADGAR (c. 1050-c. 1130), called the Aetheling, was the son of\r\nEdward, a son of the English king Edmund Ironside, by his wife Agatha, a\r\nkinswoman of the emperor Henry II., and was born probably in Hungary\r\nsome time before 1057, the year of his father's death. After the death\r\nof Harold in 1066, Archbishop Aldred and the citizens of London desired\r\nto make him king, but on the advance of William, Edgar and his\r\nsupporters made their submission. In 1068, after the failure of the\r\nfirst rising of the north, Edgar retired to Scotland, when his sister\r\nMargaret married the Scottish king, Malcolm Canmore. Next year he\r\nreturned to take part in the second rising, but, this proving no more\r\nsuccessful than the first, he again took refuge in Scotland. In 1074 he\r\nwent to Normandy and made peace with William. In the struggle between\r\nHenry I. and Robert of Normandy, Edgar sided with the latter. He was\r\ntaken prisoner at the battle of Tinchebrai in 1106, but was subsequently\r\nreleased. The date of his death is uncertain, but he was certainly alive\r\nabout 1125.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDGECUMBE, or EDGECOMBE, the name of a celebrated west of England\r\nfamily, taken from the manor of Edgecumbe in Cornwall. One of its\r\nearlier members was Sir Richard Edgecumbe (d. 1489), who was descended\r\nfrom a Richard Edgecumbe who flourished during the reign of Edward I.\r\nRichard was a member of parliament in 1467; afterwards he joined Henry,\r\nearl of Richmond, in Brittany, returned with the earl to England, and\r\nfought at Bosworth, where he was knighted. He received rich rewards from\r\nHenry, now King Henry VII., who also sent him on errands to Scotland, to\r\nIreland and to Brittany, and he died at Morlaix on the 8th of September\r\n1489. His son and successor, Sir Piers Edgecumbe, went to France with\r\nHenry VIII. in 1513, and when he died on the 14th of August 1539 he left\r\nwith other issue a son, Sir Richard Edgecumbe (1499-1562), a cultured\r\nand hospitable man, who is celebrated through Richard Carew's _Friendly\r\nRemembrance of Sir Richard Edgecumbe_. Sir Richard's eldest son, Piers\r\nor Peter Edgecumbe (1536-1607), was a member of parliament under\r\nElizabeth for about thirty years.\r\n\r\nAnother famous member of this family was Richard, 1st baron Edgecumbe\r\n(1680-1758), a son of Sir Richard Edgecumbe. Educated at Trinity\r\nCollege, Cambridge, he was successively member of parliament for St\r\nGermans, Plympton and Lostwithiel from 1701 to 1742; on two occasions he\r\nserved as a lord of the treasury; and from 1724 to 1742 he was\r\npaymaster-general for Ireland, becoming chancellor of the duchy of\r\nLancaster in 1743. Edgecumbe was a faithful follower of Sir Robert\r\nWalpole, in whose interests he managed the elections for the Cornish\r\nboroughs, and his elevation to the peerage, which took place in 1742,\r\nwas designed to prevent him from giving evidence about Walpole's\r\nexpenditure of the secret service money. He died on the 22nd of November\r\n1758. His son and successor, Richard, the 2nd baron (1716-1761), was\r\ncomptroller of the royal household, a member of parliament, and a\r\nmajor-general in the army. A wit, a writer of verse, a gambler and an\r\nintimate friend of Horace Walpole, \"Dick Edgecumbe\" died unmarried on\r\nthe 10th of May 1761.\r\n\r\nEdgecumbe's brother, George, 1st earl of Mount Edgecumbe (1721-1795),\r\nwas a naval officer who saw a great deal of service during the Seven\r\nYears' War. Succeeding to the barony on the 1st baron's death in 1761 he\r\nbecame an admiral and treasurer of the royal household; he was created\r\nViscount Mount-Edgecumbe in 1781 and earl of Mount-Edgecumbe in 1789. He\r\ndied on the 4th of February 1795, his only son being his successor,\r\nRichard, the 2nd earl (1764-1839), the ancestor of the present earl and\r\nthe author of _Musical Reminiscences of an Old Amateur_. He died on the\r\n26th of September 1839. His son, Ernest Augustus, the 3rd earl\r\n(1797-1861), wrote _Extracts from Journals kept during the Revolutions\r\nat Rome and Palermo_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDGE HILL, an elevated ridge in Warwickshire, England, near the border\r\nof Oxfordshire. The north-western face is an abrupt escarpment of the\r\nlias, and the summit of the ridge is almost level for nearly 2 m., at a\r\nheight somewhat exceeding 700 ft. The escarpment overlooks a rich\r\nlowland watered by streams tributary to the Avon; the gentle eastern\r\nslope sends its waters to the Cherwell, and the ridge thus forms part of\r\nthe divide between the basins of the Severn and the Thames. Edge Hill\r\ngave name to the first battle of the Great Rebellion (q.v.), fought on\r\nthe 23rd of October 1642. Charles I., marching on London from the\r\nnorth-west, was here met by the parliamentary forces under Robert\r\nDevereux, earl of Essex. The royalists were posted on the hill while the\r\nenemy was in the plain before Kineton. But the rash advice of Prince\r\nRupert determined the king to give up the advantage of position; he\r\ndescended to the attack, and though Rupert himself was successful\r\nagainst the opposing cavalry, he was checked by the arrival of a\r\nregiment with artillery under Hampden, and, in the meantime, the\r\nroyalist infantry was driven back. The parliamentarians, however, lost\r\nthe more heavily, and though both sides claimed the advantage, the king\r\nwas able to advance and occupy Banbury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDGEWORTH, MARIA (1767-1849), Irish novelist, second child and eldest\r\ndaughter of Richard Lovell Edgeworth (q.v.) and his first wife, Anna\r\nMaria Elers, was born in the house of her maternal grandparents at Black\r\nBourton, Oxfordshire, on the 1st of January 1767. Her early efforts in\r\nfiction were of a sufficiently melodramatic character; for she\r\nrecollected one of her schoolgirl compositions, in which the hero wore a\r\nmask made of the dried skin taken from a dead man's face. Her holidays\r\nwere often spent in the house of the eccentric Thomas Day, for whom she\r\nentertained a genuine respect. She had ample opportunities for society\r\namong her father's neighbours in Ireland, among whom were the second\r\nLord Longford, whose daughter, \"Kitty\" Pakenham, became later duchess of\r\nWellington, Lady Moira at Castle Forbes, and Maria's aunt, Margaret\r\nRuxton, at Black Castle. She gained a first-hand experience of the Irish\r\npeasantry by acting as her father's assistant in the management of the\r\nestate. The Edgeworths were in Ireland from 1793 onwards through that\r\ndangerous period, and Maria's letters, always gay and natural, make very\r\nlight of their anxieties and their real perils.\r\n\r\nMr Edgeworth encouraged his daughter's literary instincts. It has been\r\nthe fashion to regard his influence over Maria's work as altogether\r\ndeplorable, but against the disadvantages arising from his interference\r\nmust be weighed the stimulus she undoubtedly derived from his powerful\r\nmind. Her first publication was a plea for female education, _Letters to\r\nLiterary Ladies_ (1795), and in 1796 appeared the collection of stories\r\nknown as _The Parent's Assistant_ (2nd ed., 6 vols., 1800), an\r\nunpromising title which was not chosen by the author. The stories had\r\nbeen submitted as they were written to the juvenile critics of the\r\nEdgeworth nursery. They were therefore children's stories for children,\r\neven though the morals were Mr Edgeworth's. In 1798 Mr Edgeworth's\r\nfourth marriage threatened the family harmony, but Maria soon became a\r\nclose friend of her stepmother. _Practical Education_ (2 vols., 1798)\r\nwas written in conjunction with her father, who also collaborated with\r\nher in the _Essay on Irish Bulls_ (1802). Miss Edgeworth's first novel,\r\n_Castle Rackrent, an Hibernian Tale taken from Facts, and from the\r\nManners of the Irish Squires before the year 1782_, was written without\r\nher father's supervision, and appeared anonymously in 1800. It is the\r\nstory of an Irish estate and its owners, the Rackrents, as told by\r\nThady, the steward. Its success was immediate, and a second edition soon\r\nappeared with the author's name. Perhaps because of the absence of\r\nRichard Lovell Edgeworth's co-operation, the book is the most natural\r\nand vigorous of her novels. The course of the story is not altered to\r\nsuit any moral, and the personages appear to be drawn immediately from\r\nthe natives of Edgeworthstown, though Miss Edgeworth asserts that only\r\nThady himself was an actual portrait. In her realistic pictures of Irish\r\npeasant life she opened up a new vein in fiction, and even if the\r\nunquestionable excellences of _Castle Rackrent_ were less, it would\r\nstill be a noteworthy book. In the \"General Preface\" to the 1829 edition\r\nof his novels Sir Walter Scott, writing of the publication of\r\n_Waverley_, says: \"I felt that something might be attempted for my own\r\ncountry, of the same kind with that which Miss Edgeworth so fortunately\r\nachieved for Ireland,\" and in the \"Postscript, which should have been a\r\npreface,\" in the original edition of _Waverley_, he describes his aim as\r\nbeing \"in some distant degree to emulate the admirable Irish portraits\r\nof Miss Edgeworth, so different from the 'Teagues' and 'dear joys' who\r\nso long, with the most perfect family resemblance to each other,\r\noccupied the drama and the novel.\" _Belinda_ (1801) is a society novel,\r\nand one of her best books. Mr Saintsbury thinks that Miss Austen's\r\nheroines owe something of their naturalness to Belinda, who was one of\r\nthe earliest to break with the tradition of fainting and blushing.\r\n_Moral Tales for Young People_ (5 vols.) and _Early Lessons_, which\r\nincluded \"Harry and Lucy,\" \"Rosamond\" and \"Frank,\" appeared in 1801.\r\n\r\nIn 1802 the Edgeworths went abroad, first to Brussels and then to Paris.\r\nThey had already connexions in Paris through their kinsman, the abbe\r\nHenri Allen Edgeworth de Firmont, who was, however, then in exile. They\r\nmet all the notabilities in Paris, and Maria refused an offer of\r\nmarriage from a Swedish count named Edelcrantz. Although _Leonora_, not\r\npublished until four years later, is said to have been written to meet\r\nhis taste, she apparently remained then and always heart-whole; but her\r\nstepmother thought otherwise, and maintained that she suffered severely\r\nfor her decision (_Memoir_, i. 144). Returning to Edgeworthstown, Miss\r\nEdgeworth resumed her writing, which was always done in the rooms\r\ncommonly used by the whole family. _Popular Tales_ was published in\r\n1804, and _The Modern Griselda_ in the same year; _Leonora_ in 1806; and\r\nin 1809 the first series of _Tales of Fashionable Life_, three volumes\r\ncontaining \"Ennui,\" \"Madame de Fleury,\" \"Almeria,\" \"The Dun\" and\r\n\"Manoeuvring\"; the second series (3 vols., 1812) included \"The\r\nAbsentee,\" one of her best tales, which was originally designed as a\r\nplay, \"Vivian\" and \"Emilie de Coulanges.\" In 1813 Maria and her parents\r\nspent a considerable time in London, and her society was much sought\r\nafter. When _Waverley_ was published, Miss Edgeworth received a copy\r\nfrom the publishers, and at once recognized the authorship. She wrote a\r\nlong letter of appreciation (23rd of October 1814) to \"the author of\r\n_Waverley_,\" which she began with the phrase _aut Scotus, aut diabolus_,\r\nbut the letter was merely acknowledged by the publishers. _Patronage_ (4\r\nvols., 1814), the longest of her novels, and _Harrington, a tale_, and\r\n_Ormond, a tale_ (3 vols., 1817) complete the list of the works which\r\nreceived what her father called his _imprimatur_.\r\n\r\nAfter his death in 1817 Miss Edgeworth occupied herself with completing\r\nhis _Memoirs_, which were published in 1820. The book was the excuse for\r\nan attack on Mr Edgeworth's reputation in the July number of the\r\n_Quarterly Review_, which Miss Edgeworth had the courage to leave\r\nunread. Her life at Edgeworthstown was varied by visits to London, to\r\nLord Lansdowne at Bowood, Wiltshire, to the Misses Sneyd in\r\nStaffordshire, and to many other friends. In 1820 she was again in\r\nParis, and in 1823 she spent a happy fortnight with the Scotts at\r\nAbbotsford. In 1825 Scott went to Edgeworthstown, and their relations\r\nwere always cordial.\r\n\r\nMiss Edgeworth's production was less after her father's death. Sequels\r\nto \"Rosamond,\" \"Frank,\" \"Harry and Lucy\" in the _Early Lessons_ were\r\npublished in 1822-1825. _Comic Dramas_ appeared in 1817, and _Helen_ in\r\n1834. She worked to the last, and in 1846 laboured strenuously for the\r\nrelief of the famine-stricken Irish peasants. She died on the 22nd of\r\nMay 1849.\r\n\r\nMiss Edgeworth's novels are distinguished by good sense, humour and an\r\neasy flowing style. As the construction of a plot is not her strong\r\npoint, she is generally more successful in tales than in lengthy novels.\r\nThe vivacity of her dialogues is extraordinary; and in them her\r\ncharacters reveal themselves in the most natural way possible. Her books\r\nare character-studies rather than intensely interesting narratives.\r\nSobriety of judgment is seen throughout; and passion, romance and poetry\r\nrarely, if ever, shed their lustre on her pages. Three of her aims were\r\nto paint national manners, to enforce morality, and to teach fashionable\r\nsociety by satirizing the lives of the idle and worldly. She expressly\r\ncalls some of her stories \"Moral Tales\"; but they all fall under this\r\ncategory. In her pages the heroic virtues give place to prudence,\r\nindustry, kindness and sweetness of temper. There are few instances of\r\noverwhelming emotions or tumultuous passions in her works; and it is\r\nremarkable how little the love of nature appears. She never uses\r\nmaterial which does not yield some direct moral lesson. But the\r\nfreshness of her stories, her insight into character, lively dialogues,\r\noriginality of invention, and delightfully clear style render it quite\r\npossible to read her works in succession without any sense of\r\nweariness. Among the many sweet memories her unsullied pages have\r\nbequeathed to the world, not the least precious is her own noble\r\ncharacter, which ever responded to all that is best and most enduring in\r\nhuman nature.\r\n\r\n  See _A Memoir of Maria Edgeworth, with a Selection from her Letters_\r\n  (1867), by her stepmother, F.A. Edgeworth, privately printed. A\r\n  selection from this was made by Augustus J.C. Hare, and printed under\r\n  the title of _The Life and Letters of Maria Edgeworth_ (2 vols.,\r\n  1894).

Among\r\n  the numerous shorter articles dealing with Maria Edgeworth and the\r\n  family circle at Edgeworthstown may be mentioned a friendly\r\n  appreciation of Miss Edgeworth's novels by George Saintsbury in\r\n  _Macmillan's Magazine_ (July 1895), and a charming description of her\r\n  family circle and surroundings in the preface supplied by Lady\r\n  Thackeray Ritchie to Macmillan's edition of the novels (1895).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDGEWORTH, RICHARD LOVELL (1744-1817), British writer, was born at Bath\r\non the 31st of May 1744. The greater part of his life, however, was\r\nspent at Edgeworthtown, or Edgeworthstown, in the county of Longford,\r\nIreland, where the Edgeworth family had been settled for upwards of 150\r\nyears. He was of gentle blood--his father being the son of Colonel\r\nFrancis Edgeworth, and his mother, Jane Lovell, being the daughter of\r\nSamuel Lovell, a Welsh judge. Richard's mother taught him to read at a\r\nvery early age; and from childhood he had a strong love for mechanical\r\nscience. The Rev. Patrick Hughes initiated him in Lilye's _Latin\r\nGrammar_--an office he also performed for Goldsmith, who was born on the\r\nproperty of the Edgeworths--and his public education began, in August\r\n1752, in a school at Warwick. He subsequently attended Drogheda school,\r\nthen reputed the best in Ireland; and, after spending two years at a\r\nschool in Longford, entered Trinity College, Dublin, in April 1761, but\r\nwas transferred to Corpus Christi College, Oxford, in October of the\r\nsame year. While still at college, he made a runaway match, marrying at\r\nGretna Green, Anna Maria, one of the daughters of Paul Elers of Black\r\nBourton, Oxfordshire, an old friend of his father. His eldest son was\r\nborn before Edgeworth reached his twentieth birthday, and his daughter\r\nMaria in 1767.\r\n\r\nShortly after the birth of his son, he and his wife went to\r\nEdgeworthstown, but in 1765 they took a house at Hare Hatch, near\r\nMaidenhead. Edgeworth devoted much time to scientific reading and\r\nexperiments; and he made an attempt to establish telegraphic\r\ncommunication (_Memoirs_, 2nd edition, i. 144). He also invented a\r\nturnip-cutter, a one-wheeled chaise and other contrivances. In the\r\npursuit of his mechanical inventions he visited Erasmus Darwin at\r\nLichfield, where he met Anna Seward, and her cousin, Honora Sneyd. His\r\nhome was now at Hare Hatch, in Berkshire, where he endeavoured to\r\neducate his son according to the method explained in Rousseau's _Emile_.\r\nIn later life, however, the ill-success of this experiment led him to\r\ndoubt many of Rousseau's views (_Memoirs_, ii. 374). At the same time he\r\nkept terms at the Temple, and formed the greatest friendship of his life\r\nwith Thomas Day, the author of _Sandford and Merton_, which was written\r\nat Edgeworth's suggestion. In 1769, on the death of his father, he gave\r\nup the idea of being a barrister; but, instead of immediately settling\r\non his Irish estate, he spent a considerable time in England and France,\r\nmainly in Day's company. In Lyons, where he resided for about two years,\r\nhe took an active part in the management of public works intended to\r\nturn the course of the Rhone. He was summoned to England by the death of\r\nhis wife (March 1773), with whom he was far from happy. Edgeworth\r\nhurried to Lichfield, to Dr Erasmus Darwin's, and at once declared his\r\npassion for Honora Sneyd, which had been the cause of his flight to\r\nFrance two years before. Miss Sneyd had been the object of attention\r\nfrom Thomas Day, but her views on marriage were not submissive enough to\r\nplease him. She had other suitors, among them the unfortunate Major\r\nAndre. She married Edgeworth (July 1773), and after residing at\r\nEdgeworthstown for three years, they settled at Northchurch, in\r\nHertfordshire. After six years of domestic happiness, Honora Edgeworth\r\ndied (April 1780), recommending her husband to marry her sister\r\nElizabeth; and they were actually married on Christmas Day, 1780.\r\n\r\nIn 1782 Edgeworth returned to Ireland, determined to improve his estate,\r\neducate his seven children, and ameliorate the condition of the tenants.\r\nUp to this point Edgeworth has told his own story in his _Memoirs_. The\r\nrest of his life is written by his daughter, who opens with a lengthy\r\npanegyric on her father as a model landlord (_Memoirs_, ii. 12-36). In\r\n1785 he was associated with others in founding the Royal Irish Academy;\r\nand, during the two succeeding years, mechanics and agriculture occupied\r\nmost of his time. In October 1789 his friend Day was killed by a fall\r\nfrom his horse, and this trial was soon followed by the loss of his\r\ndaughter Honora, who had just reached her fifteenth year. In 1792 the\r\nhealth of one of Edgeworth's sons took him to Clifton, where he remained\r\nwith his family for about two years, returning in 1794 to\r\nEdgeworthstown. Ireland was, at that time, harassed by internal\r\ndisturbances, and threats of a French invasion, and Edgeworth offered to\r\nestablish telegraphic communication of his own invention throughout the\r\ncountry. This offer was declined. A full account of the matter is given\r\nin Edgeworth's _Letter to Lord Charlemont on the Telegraph_; and his\r\napparatus is explained in an \"Essay on the art of Conveying Swift and\r\nSecret Intelligence,\" published in the sixth volume of the _Transactions\r\nof the Royal Irish Academy_. In the autumn of 1797 the third Mrs\r\nEdgeworth died.\r\n\r\n_Practical Education_ (1798) was written in collaboration with his\r\ndaughter Maria, and embodied the experience of the authors in dealing\r\nwith children. \"So commenced,\" says Miss Edgeworth, \"that literary\r\npartnership which, for so many years, was the pride and joy of my life\"\r\n(_Memoirs_, ii. 170). This book, generally regarded as old-fashioned,\r\nhas a real value in the history of education. Mr Edgeworth's interest in\r\nthe subject had been inspired by the study of Rousseau and by his\r\nfriendship with Thomas Day. But he went beyond Rousseau, who developed\r\nhis theories from his own ingenious mind and related an imaginary\r\nprocess. The Edgeworths brought a scientific method to their work. The\r\nsecond Mrs Edgeworth (Honora Sneyd) began the collection of actual\r\nexamples of conversations between the children and their elders. This\r\nwas continued patiently by the writers of the book; and their reasonings\r\nwere thus founded on an accurate record of childish methods of thought.\r\nThey deprecated especially any measures that interrupted the child's own\r\nchain of reasoning. The chapters on special subjects of study,\r\nchronology, geometry, &c., were written by Richard Lovell Edgeworth;\r\nthose on toys, on rewards and punishments, on temper, &c., by his\r\ndaughter.[1]\r\n\r\nIn 1798 Edgeworth married Miss Beaufort, and was elected M.P. for the\r\nborough of St John's Town, Longford. The same year, too, saw a hostile\r\nlanding of the French and a formidable rebellion; and for a short time\r\nthe Edgeworths took refuge in Longford. The winter of 1802 they spent in\r\nParis. In 1804 the government accepted his telegraphic apparatus, but\r\nthe installation was left incomplete when the fear of invasion was past.\r\nIn 1802 appeared the _Essay on Irish Bulls_ by Mr and Miss Edgeworth;\r\nand in 1806 Edgeworth was elected a member of the board of commissioners\r\nto inquire into Irish education. From 1807 till 1809 much of his time\r\nwas spent on mechanical experiments and in writing the story of his\r\nlife. In 1808 appeared _Professional Education_, and in 1813 his _Essay\r\non the Construction of Roads and Carriages_. He died on the 13th of June\r\n1817, and was buried in the family vault in Edgeworthstown churchyard.\r\n\r\nMany of Edgeworth's works were suggested by his zeal for the education\r\nof his own children. Such were _Poetry Explained for Young People_\r\n(1802), _Readings in Poetry_ (1816), _A Rational Primer_ (unpublished),\r\nand the parts of _Early Lessons_ contributed by him. His speeches in the\r\nIrish parliament have also been published; and numerous essays, mostly\r\non scientific subjects, have appeared in the _Philosophical\r\nTransactions_, the _Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy_, the\r\n_Monthly Magazine_ and _Nicholson's Journal_. The story of his early\r\nlife, told by himself, is fully as entertaining as the continuation by\r\nMaria, as it contains less dissertation and more incident. One of his\r\ndaughters by his first marriage, Anna Maria, married Dr Beddoes and\r\nbecame the mother of T.L. Beddoes, the poet.\r\n\r\n  See _Memoirs of Richard Lovell Edgeworth, Esq._, begun by himself and\r\n  concluded by his daughter, Maria Edgeworth (2 vols., 1820, 3rd and\r\n  revised ed. 1844). A selection from this, giving an optimistic view of\r\n  him, _Richard Lovell Edgeworth_ (1896), was edited by Mrs Lionel\r\n  Tollemache.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] For an appreciation of the two Edgeworths from the teacher's\r\n    point of view, see Prof. L.C. Miall in the _Journal of Education_\r\n    (August 1, 1894).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDGEWORTH DE FIRMONT, HENRY ESSEX (1745-1807), last confessor to Louis\r\nXVI., was the son of Robert Edgeworth, rector of Edgeworthstown in\r\nIreland, his mother being a granddaughter of Archbishop Ussher. When he\r\nwas three years old his father became a Roman Catholic, resigned his\r\nliving and emigrated to Toulouse, where the boy was brought up by the\r\nJesuits. In 1769, after his father's death, he went to Paris to be\r\ntrained for the priesthood. On taking orders he assumed the additional\r\nsurname of de Firmont, from the family estate of Firmount near\r\nEdgeworthstown. Though originally studying with a view to becoming a\r\nmissionary, he decided to remain in Paris, devoting himself especially\r\nto the Irish and English Roman Catholics. In 1791 he became confessor to\r\nthe princess Elizabeth, sister of Louis XVI., and earned the respect\r\neven of the _sans-culottes_ by his courage and devotion. By Madame\r\nElizabeth he was recommended to the king when his trial was impending;\r\nand after Louis' condemnation to death he was able to obtain permission\r\nto celebrate mass for him and attend him on the scaffold, where he\r\nrecommended the king to allow his hands to be tied, with the words:\r\n\"Sire, in this new outrage I see only the last trait of resemblance\r\nbetween your Majesty and the God who will be your reward.\" It is said\r\nthat at the moment of the execution, the confessor uttered the\r\ncelebrated words: \"Son of St Louis, ascend to heaven.\" But it is certain\r\nthat the phrase was never spoken. The abbe himself does not quote it,\r\neither in his memoirs or in a letter written in 1796 to his brother, in\r\nwhich he describes the death of the king. Moreover, Edgeworth declared\r\nto several persons who asked him about it, that the words were not his.\r\nIn spite of the danger he now ran, Edgeworth refused to leave France so\r\nlong as he could be of any service to Madame Elizabeth, with whom he\r\nstill managed to correspond. At length, in 1795, his mother having\r\nmeanwhile died in prison, where his sister was also confined, he\r\nsucceeded in escaping to England, carrying with him Elizabeth's last\r\nmessage to her brother, the future King Charles X. whom he found in\r\nEdinburgh. He afterwards went with some papers to Monsieur (Louis\r\nXVIII.) at Blankenburg in Brunswick, by whom he was induced to accompany\r\nhim to Mittau, where, on the 22nd of May 1807, he died of a fever\r\ncontracted while attending some French prisoners.\r\n\r\n  Edgeworth's _Memories_, edited by C.S. Edgeworth, were first published\r\n  in English (London, 1815), and a French translation (really the\r\n  letters and some miscellaneous notes, &c.) was published in Paris in\r\n  1816. A translation of the _Lettres de l'abbe Edgeworth avec des\r\n  memoires sur sa vie_ was published by Madame Elizabeth de Bow in Paris\r\n  in 1818, and _Letters from the Abbe Edgeworth to his Friends, with\r\n  Memoirs of his Life_, edited by T.B. England, in London in 1818. See\r\n  J.B.A. Hanet-Clery, _Journal de ce qui s'est passe, &c._ (Paris,\r\n  1825); A.H. du D. de Beauchesne, _Vie de Madame Elisabeth_ (Paris,\r\n  1869); J.C.D. de Lacretelle, _Precis historique de la Revolution\r\n  francaise_ (Paris, 1801-1806).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDGREN-LEFFLER, ANNE CHARLOTTE, duchess of Cajanello (1849-1892),\r\nSwedish author, daughter of the mathematician Prof. C.O. Leffler, was\r\nborn on the 1st of October 1849. Her first volume of stories appeared in\r\n1869, but the first to which she attached her name was _Ur Lifvet_\r\n(\"From Life,\" 1882), a series of realistic sketches of the upper circles\r\nof Swedish society, followed by three other collections with the same\r\ntitle. Her earliest plays, _Skadespelerskan_ (\"The Actress,\" 1873), and\r\nits successors, were produced anonymously in Stockholm, but in 1883 her\r\nreputation was established by the success of _Sanna Kvinnor_ (\"True\r\nWomen\"), and _En Raddande engel_ (\"An Angel of Deliverance\"). _Sanna\r\nKvinnor_ is directed against false femininity, and was well received in\r\nGermany as well as in Sweden. Anne Leffler had married in 1872 G.\r\nEdgren, but about 1884 she was separated from her husband, who did not\r\nshare her advanced views. She spent some time in England, and in 1885\r\nproduced her _Hur man gor godt_ (\"How men do good\"), followed in 1888 by\r\n_Kampen for lyckan_ (\"The Struggle for Happiness\"), in which she had the\r\nhelp of Sophie Kovalevsky. Another volume of the _Ur Lisvet_ series\r\nappeared in 1889; and _Familjelycka_ (\"Domestic Happiness,\" 1891) was\r\nproduced in the year after her second marriage, with the Italian\r\nmathematician, Pasquale del Pezzo, duca di Cajanello. She died at Naples\r\non the 21st of October 1892. Her dramatic method forms a connecting link\r\nbetween Ibsen and Strindberg, and its masculine directness, freedom from\r\nprejudice, and frankness gave her work a high estimation in Sweden. Her\r\nlast book was a biography (1892) of her friend Sophie (Sonya)\r\nKovalevsky, by way of introduction to Sonya's autobiography. An English\r\ntranslation (1895) by A. de Furnhjelm and A.M. Clive Bayley contains a\r\nbiographical note on Fru Edgren-Leffler by Lily Wolffsohn, based on\r\nprivate sources.\r\n\r\n  See also Ellen Key, _Anne Charlotte Leffler_ (Stockholm, 1893).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDHEM PASHA (c. 1815-1893), Turkish statesman, was of Greek origin, and\r\nis said to have been taken into a Turkish household at the time of the\r\nChio massacre in 1822, and to have been brought up as a Mussulman. He\r\nentered the Turkish government service and rose to high office, being\r\nsuccessively minister of public works, grand vizier for eleven months\r\n(1878), ambassador at Vienna (1879) and minister of the interior. He was\r\nquick-tempered, but of kindly disposition, intelligent and patriotic,\r\nand he left a reputation of unblemished honesty and uprightness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDICT (Lat. _edictum_, from _e_, out, and _dicere_, to say, speak), an\r\norder or proclamation issued under authority and having the force of\r\nlaw. The word is especially used of the promulgations of the Roman\r\npraetor (q.v.), of the Roman emperors, and also of the kings of France\r\n(see also ROMAN LAW).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDINBURGH, a city and royal burgh, and county of itself, the capital of\r\nScotland, and county town of Edinburghshire or Midlothian, situated to\r\nthe south of the Firth of Forth, 396 m. by rail N. of London. The old\r\nRoyal Observatory on Calton Hill stands in 55 deg. 57' 23\" N. and 12\r\ndeg. 43' 05\" W. Edinburgh occupies a group of hills of moderate height\r\nand the valleys between. In the centre is a bold rock, crowned by the\r\ncastle, between which and the new town lies a ravine that once contained\r\nthe Nor' Loch, but is now covered with the gardens of Princes Street. To\r\nthe east rises Calton Hill (355 ft.) with several conspicuous monuments,\r\nthe city prison and the Calton cemetery. On the south-east, beyond the\r\nCanongate limits, stands the hill of Arthur's Seat (822 ft.). Towards\r\nthe north the site of the city slopes gently to the Firth of Forth and\r\nthe port of Leith; while to the south, Liberton Hill, Blackford Hill,\r\nBraid Hills and Craiglockhart Hills roughly mark the city bounds, as\r\nCorstorphine Hill and the Water of Leith do the western limits. The\r\nviews of the city and environs from the castle or any of the hills are\r\nvery beautiful, and it is undoubtedly one of the most picturesque\r\ncapitals in the world. Its situation, general plan and literary\r\nassociations suggested a comparison that gave Edinburgh the name of \"the\r\nmodern Athens\"; but it has a homelier nickname of \"Auld Reekie,\" from\r\nthe cloud of smoke (reek) which often hangs over the low-lying quarters.\r\n\r\n_Chief Buildings._--Of the castle, the oldest building is St Margaret's\r\nchapel, believed to be the chapel where Queen Margaret, wife of Malcolm\r\nCanmore, worshipped, and belonging at latest to the reign of her\r\nyoungest son, David I. (1124-1153). Near it is the parliament and\r\nbanqueting hall, restored (1889-1892) by the generosity of William\r\nNelson (1817-1887) the publisher, which contains a fine collection of\r\nScottish armour, weapons and regimental colours, while, emblazoned on\r\nthe windows, are the heraldic bearings of royal and other figures\r\ndistinguished in national history. Other buildings in the Palace Yard\r\ninclude the apartments occupied by the regent, Mary of Guise, and her\r\ndaughter Mary, queen of Scots, and the room in which James VI. was born.\r\nHere also are deposited the Scottish regalia (\"The Honours of\r\nScotland\"), with the sword of state presented to James IV. by Pope\r\nJulius II., and the jewels restored to Scotland on the death (1807) of\r\nCardinal York, the last of the Stuarts. The arsenal, a modern building\r\non the west side of the rock, is capable of storing 30,000 stand of\r\narms. In the armoury is a collection of arms of various dates; and on\r\nthe Argyll battery stands a huge piece of ancient artillery, called Mons\r\nMeg, of which repeated mention is made in Scottish history. Argyll\r\nTower, in which Archibald, 9th earl of Argyll, spent his last days\r\n(1685), was also restored in 1892 by Mr William Nelson.\r\n\r\nHolyrood Palace was originally an abbey of canons regular of the rule of\r\nSt Augustine, founded by David I. in 1128, and the ruined nave of the\r\nabbey church still shows parts of the original structure. Connected with\r\nthis is a part of the royal palace erected by James IV. and James V.,\r\nincluding the apartments occupied by Queen Mary, the scene of the murder\r\nof Rizzio in 1566. The abbey suffered repeatedly in invasions. It was\r\nsacked and burnt by the English under the earl of Hertford in 1544, and\r\nagain in 1547. In a map of 1544, preserved among the Cotton MSS. in the\r\nBritish Museum, the present north-west tower of the palace is shown\r\nstanding apart, and only joined to the abbey by a low cloister. Beyond\r\nthis is an irregular group of buildings, which were replaced at a later\r\ndate by additions more in accordance with a royal residence. But the\r\nwhole of this latter structure was destroyed by fire in 1650 while in\r\noccupation by the soldiers of Cromwell; and the more modern parts were\r\nbegun during the Protectorate, and completed in the reign of Charles II.\r\nby Robert Milne, after the designs of Sir William Bruce of Kinross. They\r\ninclude the picture gallery, 150 ft. in length, with 106 mythical\r\nportraits of Scottish kings, and a triptych (c. 1484) containing\r\nportraits of James III. and his queen, which is believed to have formed\r\nthe altar-piece of the collegiate church of the Holy Trinity, founded by\r\nthe widowed queen of James II. in 1462, demolished in 1848, and\r\nafterwards rebuilt, stone for stone, in Jeffrey Street. The picture\r\ngallery is associated with the festive scenes that occurred during the\r\nshort residence of Prince Charles in 1745; and in it the election of\r\nrepresentative peers for Scotland takes place. Escaping from France at\r\nthe revolution of 1789, the comte d'Artois, afterwards Charles X. of\r\nFrance, had apartments granted for the use of himself and the emigrant\r\nnobles of his suite, who continued to reside in the palace till August\r\n1799. When driven from the French throne by the revolution of 1830,\r\nCharles once more found a home in the ancient palace of the Stuarts.\r\nGeorge IV. was received there in 1822, and Queen Victoria and the prince\r\nconsort occupied the palace for brief periods on several occasions, and\r\nin 1903 Edward VII., during residence at Dalkeith Palace, held his court\r\nwithin its walls. A fountain, after the original design of that in the\r\nquadrangle of Linlithgow Palace, was erected in front of the entrance by\r\nthe prince consort. The royal vault in the Chapel Royal, which had\r\nfallen into a dilapidated condition, has been put in order; Clockmill\r\nHouse and grounds have been added to the area of the parade ground, and\r\nthe abbey precincts generally and the approaches to the King's Park have\r\nbeen improved. With the abolition of imprisonment for debt in 1881 the\r\nprivileges of sanctuary came to an end.\r\n\r\nParliament House, begun in 1632 and completed in 1640, in which the\r\nlater assemblies of the Scottish estates took place until the\r\ndissolution of the parliament by the Act of Union of 1707, has since\r\nbeen set apart as the meeting-place of the supreme courts of law. The\r\ngreat hall, with its fine open-timbered oak roof, is adorned with a\r\nsplendid stained-glass window and several statues of notable men,\r\nincluding one (by Louis Francois Roubiliac) of Duncan Forbes of\r\nCulloden, lord president of the court of session (1685-1747), and now\r\nforms the ante-room for lawyers and their clients. The surrounding\r\nbuildings, including the courtrooms, the Advocates' and the Signet\r\nlibraries, are all modern additions. The Advocates' library is the\r\nfinest in Scotland. Founded in 1682, at the instance of Sir George\r\nMackenzie, king's advocate under Charles II., and then dean of the\r\nfaculty, it is regarded as the national library, and is one of the five\r\nentitled by the Copyright Act to receive a copy of every work published\r\nin Great Britain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map of Edinburgh.]\r\n\r\nThe General Register House for Scotland, begun in 1774 from designs by\r\nRobert Adam, stands at the east end of Princes Street. It contains, in\r\naddition to the ancient national records, adequate accommodation, in\r\nfireproof chambers, for all Scottish title-deeds, entails, contracts and\r\nmortgages, and for general statistics, including those of births, deaths\r\nand marriages.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Institution, in the Doric style, surmounted by a colossal\r\nstone statue Of Queen Victoria by Sir John Steell, formerly furnished\r\nofficial accommodation for the Board of Trustees for Manufactures and\r\nthe Board of Fishery, and also for the school of art, and the libraries\r\nand public meetings of the Royal Society (founded in 1783), and the\r\nSociety of Antiquaries of Scotland (founded in 1780). In 1910 it was\r\nrenamed and appropriated to the uses of the Royal Scottish Academy of\r\nPainting, Sculpture and Architecture, which was instituted in 1826, and\r\nincorporated by royal charter in 1838, on the model of the Royal Academy\r\nin London. It is situated on the Mound close to the National Gallery, of\r\nwhich the prince consort laid the foundation stone in 1850. These\r\ncollections, especially rich in Raeburn's works, include also Alexander\r\nNasmyth's portrait of Robert Burns, Gainsborough's \"The Hon. Mrs.\r\nGraham\" (see PAINTING, Plate VI. fig. 20), Sir Noel Paton's \"Quarrel\"\r\nand \"Reconciliation of Oberon and Titania,\" several works by William\r\nEtty, Robert Scott Lauder and Sam Bough, Sir Edwin Landseer's \"Rent Day\r\nin the Wilderness,\" and the diploma pictures of the academicians,\r\nbesides many specimens of the modern Scottish school. The National\r\nPortrait Gallery and Antiquarian Museum are housed in Queen Street, in a\r\nbuilding designed by Sir Rowand Anderson and constructed at the expense\r\nof J.R. Findlay of Aberlour (1824-1898), the government providing the\r\nsite.\r\n\r\n_Churches._--In conformity with the motto of the city, _Nisi Dominus\r\nfrustra_, there are numerous handsome places of public worship. St\r\nGiles's church, which was effectively restored (1879-1883) by the\r\nliberality of Dr William Chambers the publisher, has interesting\r\nhistorical and literary associations. The regent Moray, the marquess of\r\nMontrose, and Napier of Merchiston were buried within its walls and are\r\ncommemorated by monuments, and among the memorial tablets is one to R.L.\r\nStevenson by Augustus St Gaudens. The choir (restored in 1873 by public\r\nsubscription) is a fine example of 15th-century architecture, and the\r\nGothic crown surmounting the central tower forms one of the most\r\ncharacteristic features in every view of the city. Just outside the\r\nchurch in Parliament Square, the supposed grave of John Knox is\r\nindicated by a stone set in the pavement bearing his initials, and in\r\nthe pavement to the west a heart indicates the site of the old\r\nTolbooth,[1] which figures prominently in Scott's _Heart of Midlothian_.\r\nOther churches having historical associations are the two Greyfriars\r\nchurches, which occupy the two halves of one building; Tron church, the\r\nscene of midnight hilarity at the new year; St Cuthbert's church; St\r\nAndrew's church in George Street, whence set out, on a memorable day in\r\n1843, that long procession of ministers and elders to Tanfield Hall\r\nwhich ended in the founding of the Free Church; St George's church in\r\nCharlotte Square, a good example of the work of Robert Adam. The United\r\nFree Church claims no buildings of much historic interest, but St\r\nGeorge's Free was the scene of the ministrations of Dr Robert S.\r\nCandlish (1806-1873), Dr Oswald Dykes (b. 1835), Dr Alexander Whyte (b.\r\n1837), a man of great mark and influence in the city, and his successor\r\nHugh Black (b. 1868). Preachers like Robert Candlish, Thomas Guthrie\r\n(1803-1873), Marcus Dods (b. 1834), occupied many pulpits, besides those\r\nof the particular congregations whom each served. The most imposing\r\nstructure belonging to the Scottish Episcopal Church is St Mary's\r\ncathedral, built on ground and chiefly from funds left by the Misses\r\nWalker of Coates, and opened for worship in 1879. It is in the Early\r\nPointed style, by Sir Gilbert Scott, is 278 ft. long, and is surmounted\r\nby a spire 275 ft. high. The old-fashioned mansion of East Coates,\r\ndating from the 17th century, still stands in the close, and is occupied\r\nby functionaries of the cathedral. St John's Episcopal church at the\r\nwest end of Princes Street was the scene of the ministrations of Dean\r\nRamsay, and St Paul's Episcopal church of the Rev. Archibald Alison,\r\nfather of the historian. The Catholic Apostolic church at the foot of\r\nBroughton Street is architecturally noticeable, and one of its features\r\nis a set of mural paintings executed by Mrs Traquair. The Central Hall\r\nat Tollcross testifies to Methodist energy. John Knox's house at the\r\neast end of High Street is kept in excellent repair, and contains\r\nseveral articles of furniture that belonged to the reformer. The\r\nCanongate Tolbooth adjoins the parish church, in the burial-ground of\r\nwhich is the tombstone raised by Burns to the memory of Robert\r\nFergusson, and where Dugald Stewart, Adam Smith and other men of note\r\nwere buried. Almost opposite to it stands Moray House, from the balcony\r\nof which the 8th earl of Argyll watched Montrose led to execution\r\n(1650). The city gaol, a castellated structure on the black rock of\r\nCalton Hill, forms one of the most striking groups of buildings in the\r\ntown. In the Music Hall in George Street, Carlyle, as lord rector of the\r\nuniversity, delivered his stimulating address on books to the students,\r\nand Gladstone addressed the electors in his Midlothian campaigns. St\r\nBernard's Well, on the Water of Leith, was embellished and restored\r\n(1888) at the cost of Mr William Nelson. A sum of L100,000 was\r\nbequeathed by Mr Andrew Usher (1826-1898) for a hall to be called the\r\nUsher Hall and to supplement the municipal buildings. The library of\r\nthe solicitors to the supreme courts presents to the Cowgate a lofty\r\nelevation in red sandstone. The Sheriff Court Buildings stand on George\r\nIV. Bridge, and facing them is Mr Andrew Carnegie's free library\r\n(1887-1889). At the corner of High Street and George IV. Bridge stand\r\nthe County buildings. The _Scotsman_ newspaper is housed in an ornate\r\nstructure in North Bridge Street, the building of which necessitated the\r\ndemolition of many old alleys and wynds, such as Fleshmarket Close and\r\nMilne Square. Ramsay Gardens, a students' quarter fostered by Prof.\r\nPatrick Geddes (b. 1854), grew out of the \"goose-pie\" house where Allan\r\nRamsay lived, and with its red-tiled roof and effective lines adds\r\nwarmth to the view of the Old Town from Princes Street. Not the least\r\ninteresting structure is the old City Cross (restored at the cost of\r\nW.E. Gladstone), which stands in High Street, adjoining St Giles's.\r\nSeveral of the quaint groups of buildings of Auld Reekie have been\r\ncarefully restored, such as the White Horse Close in the Canongate; the\r\nmass of alleys on the north side of the Lawnmarket, from Paterson's\r\nClose to James's Court have been connected, and here Lord Rosebery\r\nacquired and restored the 17th-century dwelling which figures in the\r\nlegend of _My Aunt Margaret's Mirror_. Another model restoration of a\r\nhistoric close is found in Riddle's Close, which contains a students'\r\nsettlement. If these and other improvements have led to the\r\ndisappearance of such old-world picturesque buildings as Allan Ramsay's\r\nshop \"at the sign of the Mercury, opposite Niddry Wynd,\" Cardinal\r\nBeaton's palace, the old Cunzie House, or mint, the beautiful\r\ntimber-fronted \"land\" that stood at the head of the West Bow, and even\r\nsuch \"howffs\" as Clerihugh's tavern, where Mr Counsellor Pleydell and\r\nthe rest played the \"high jinks\" described in _Guy Mannering_, it must\r\nbe conceded that the changes in the Old Town (many of a drastic nature)\r\nhave been carried out with due regard to the character of their\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\n_Monuments._--Edinburgh is particularly rich in monuments of every\r\ndescription and quality. Of these by far the most remarkable is the\r\nScott monument in East Princes Street Gardens, designed by George Meikle\r\nKemp (1795-1844); it is in the form of a spiral Gothic cross with a\r\ncentral canopy beneath which is a seated statue of Scott with his dog\r\n\"Maida\" at his side, by Sir John Steell, the niches being occupied by\r\ncharacters in Sir Walter's writings. A column, 136 ft. high, surmounted\r\nby a colossal figure of Viscount Melville, Pitt's first lord of the\r\nAdmiralty, rises from the centre of St Andrew Square. At the west end of\r\nGeorge Street, in the centre of Charlotte Square, stands the Albert\r\nMemorial, an equestrian statue of the prince consort, with groups at\r\neach of the four angles of the base. Burns's monument, in the style of a\r\nGreek temple, occupies a prominent position on the Regent Road, on the\r\nsouthern brow of the lower terrace of Calton Hill. It was originally\r\nintended to form a shrine for Flaxman's marble statue of the poet (now\r\nin the National Portrait Gallery), but it proved to be too confined to\r\nafford a satisfactory view of the sculptor's work and was at length\r\nconverted into a museum of Burnsiana (afterwards removed to the\r\nmunicipal buildings). On Calton Hill are a number of finely placed\r\nmonuments. The stateliest is the national monument to commemorate the\r\nvictory of Waterloo, originally intended to be a reproduction of the\r\nParthenon. The plan was abandoned for lack of funds, after twelve out of\r\nthe twenty-four Greek pillars had been erected, but it is perhaps more\r\neffective in its unfinished state than if it had been completed. The\r\nNelson monument, an elongated turreted structure, stands on the highest\r\ncliff of the hill. Close by is the monument to Dugald Stewart, a copy of\r\nthe choragic monument of Lysicrates. Sir John Steell's equestrian statue\r\nof the duke of Wellington stands in front of the Register House, and in\r\nPrinces Street Gardens are statues of Livingstone, Christopher North,\r\nAllan Ramsay, Adam Black and Sir J.Y. Simpson. In George Street are\r\nChantrey's figures of Pitt and George IV., and a statue of Dr Chalmers;\r\nthe 5th duke of Buccleuch stands beside St Giles's. Charles II. surveys\r\nthe spot where Knox was buried; the reformer himself is in the\r\nquadrangle of New College: Sir David Brewster adorns the quadrangle of\r\nthe university; Dr William Chambers is in Chambers Street, and\r\nFrederick, duke of York (1763-1827), and the 4th earl of Hopetoun are\r\nalso commemorated.\r\n\r\n_Cemeteries._--Obviously the churchyards surrounding the older and more\r\nimportant parish churches--such as Greyfriars', St Cuthbert's and the\r\nCanongate, contain the greatest number of memorials of the illustrious\r\ndead. In Greyfriars' churchyard the Solemn League and Covenant was\r\nsigned, and among its many monuments are the Martyrs' monument,\r\nrecording the merits of the murdered covenanters, and the tomb of\r\n\"Bluidy\" Mackenzie. To the three named should be added the Calton\r\nburying-ground, with its Roman tomb of David Hume, and the obelisk\r\nraised in 1844 to the memory of Maurice Margarot, Thomas Muir\r\n(1765-1798), Thomas Fyshe Palmer (1747-1802), William Skirving and\r\nJoseph Gerrald (1765-1796), the political martyrs transported towards\r\nthe end of the 18th century for advocating parliamentary reform. The\r\nScottish dead in the American Civil War are commemorated in a monument\r\nbearing a life-sized figure of Abraham Lincoln and a freed slave. The\r\ncemeteries are all modern. In Warriston cemetery (opened in 1843) in the\r\nNew Town, were buried Sir James Young Simpson, Alexander Smith the poet,\r\nHoratio McCulloch, R.S.A., the landscape painter, the Rev. James Millar,\r\nthe last Presbyterian chaplain of the castle, and the Rev. James Peddie,\r\nthe pastor of Bristo Street church. In Dean cemetery, partly laid out on\r\nthe banks of the Water of Leith, and considered the most beautiful in\r\nthe city (opened 1845), were interred Lords Cockburn, Jeffrey and\r\nRutherford; \"Christopher North,\" Professor Aytoun, Edward Forbes the\r\nnaturalist, John Goodsir the anatomist; Sir William Allan, Sam Bough,\r\nGeorge Paul Chalmers, the painters; George Combe, the phrenologist;\r\nPlayfair, the architect; Alexander Russel, editor of the _Scotsman_; Sir\r\nArchibald Alison, the historian; Captain John Grant, the last survivor\r\nof the old Peninsular Gordon Highlanders; Captain Charles Gray, of the\r\nRoyal Marines, writer of Scottish songs; Lieutenant John Irving, of the\r\nFranklin expedition, whose remains were sent home many years after his\r\ndeath by Lieut. Frederick Schwatka, U.S. navy; and Sir Hector Macdonald,\r\n\"Fighting Mac\" of Omdurman. In the south side are the Grange, Newington\r\nor Echobank, and Morningside cemeteries. In the Grange repose the ashes\r\nof Chalmers, Guthrie and Lee, Sir Thomas Dick Lauder, Sir Hope Grant,\r\nHugh Miller and the 2nd Lord Dunfermline.\r\n\r\n_Parks and Open Spaces._--Edinburgh is exceptionally well provided with\r\nparks and open spaces. The older are Princes Street Gardens, covering\r\nthe old Nor' Loch, Calton Hill, the Meadows and the Bruntsfield Links.\r\nThe municipal golf links are on the Braid Hills. On the southern side\r\nBlackford Hill has been set apart for public use. Here stands the Royal\r\nObservatory, in which the great Dunecht telescope was erected in 1896.\r\nHarrison Park is a breathing spot for the congested district of\r\nFountainbridge, and the park at Saughton Hall, opened in 1905, for the\r\nwestern district of the city. To the north of the Water of Leith lie\r\nInverleith Park, the Arboretum and the Royal Botanical Garden. This\r\ninstitution has undergone four changes of site since its foundation in\r\n1670 by Sir Andrew Balfour and Sir Robert Sibbald, and now occupies an\r\narea of 34 acres in Inverleith Row. It includes a herbarium and palm\r\nhouse, with an extensive range of hot-houses, a museum of economic\r\nbotany, a lecture-room and other requisites for the study of botany. The\r\nmost important open spaces, however, surround Arthur's Seat (822 ft.).\r\nThis basaltic hill, the name of which is believed to commemorate the\r\nBritish king Arthur, who from its height is said to have watched the\r\ndefeat of the Picts by his followers, is shaped like a lion _couchant_,\r\nwith head towards the north. It is separated from the narrow valley, in\r\nwhich lie the Canongate and Holyrood Palace, by Salisbury Crags, named\r\nafter Edward III.'s general William Montacute, 1st earl of Salisbury\r\n(1301-1344). At their base is the Queen's Drive (3-1/2 m. long), named\r\nby Queen Victoria. Adjoining Holyrood Palace is the King's Park, used as\r\na parade ground. Facing the crags on the south-west are the spots\r\nfamiliar to readers of _The Heart of Midlothian_, where stood Jeanie\r\nDeans's cottage, and between the crags and Arthur's Seat lies Hunter's\r\nBog, used as a shooting range. Near here too are three small lakes,\r\nDuddingston, Dunsappie and St Margaret's, the last overlooked by the\r\nruins of St Anthony's chapel.\r\n\r\n_Environs._--In several directions many places once to be described\r\namong the environs have practically become suburbs of Edinburgh.\r\nNewhaven (population of parish, 7636), so called from the harbour\r\nconstructed in the reign of James IV., had a shipbuilding yard of some\r\nrepute in former times. The village has always been a fishing-place of\r\nimportance, the \"fishwives\" in their picturesque garb being, till\r\nrecently, conspicuous figures in the streets of the capital. It used to\r\nbe a popular resort for fish dinners, and it plays a prominent part in\r\nCharles Reade's novel of _Christie Johnstone_. To the west lies Granton\r\n(pop. 1728), where the 5th duke of Buccleuch constructed a magnificent\r\nharbour. Before the building of the Forth Bridge the customary approach\r\nto Fifeshire and the north-east of Scotland was by means of a steam\r\nferry from Granton to Burntisland, which is still used to some extent.\r\nThere is regular communication with Iceland, the continental ports and\r\nLondon. A marine station here was established by Sir John Murray, but\r\nhas been discontinued. Still farther west lies the village of Cramond\r\n(pop. of parish, 3815), at the mouth of the river Almond, where Roman\r\nremains have often been found. It was the birthplace of several\r\nwell-known persons, among others of John Law (1671-1729), originator of\r\nthe Mississippi scheme, Lauriston Castle being situated in the parish.\r\nCramond Brig was the scene of one of the \"roving\" adventures of James\r\nV., when the life of the \"Gudeman of Ballengeich\" was saved by Jock\r\nHowieson of the Braehead. Corstorphine (pop. 2725), once noted for its\r\ncream and also as a spa, is now to all intents and purposes a western\r\nsuburb of the capital. The parish church contains the tombs of the\r\nForresters, of old the leading family of the district, with full-length\r\nsculptured figures, and at the base of Corstorphine Hill--from one point\r\nof which (\"Rest and be Thankful\") is to be had one of the best views of\r\nEdinburgh--are the seats of several well-known families. Among these are\r\nCraigcrook Castle (where Lord Jeffrey spent many happy years, and the\r\ngardens of which are said to have given Scott a hint for Tullyveolan in\r\n_Waverley_), and Ravelston House, the home of the Keiths. To the south\r\nof the metropolis are Colinton (pop. 5499), on the Water of Leith, with\r\nseveral mansions that once belonged to famous men, such as Dreghorn\r\nCastle and Bonally Tower; and Currie (pop. 2513), which was a Roman\r\nstation and near which are Curriehill Castle (held by the rebels against\r\nQueen Mary), the ruins of Lennox Tower, and Riccarton, the seat of the\r\nGibson-Craigs, one of the best-known Midlothian families. At Dalmahoy\r\nCastle, near Ratho (pop. 1946), the seat of the earl of Morton, are\r\npreserved the only extant copy of the bible of the Scottish parliament\r\nand the original warrant for committing Queen Mary to Lochleven Castle\r\nin Kinross-shire. Craigmillar, though situated in the parish of\r\nLiberton, is really a part of Edinburgh. Its picturesque castle, at\r\nleast the oldest portion of it, probably dates from the 12th century.\r\nIts principal owners were first the Prestons and latterly the Gilmours.\r\nAfter playing a varied role in local and national story, now as\r\nbanqueting-house and now as prison, it fell gradually into disrepair. It\r\nwas advertised as to let in 1761, and early in the 19th century, along\r\nwith the chapel adjoining, was in ruins, but has been restored by\r\nColonel Gordon-Gilmour. It was a favourite residence of Mary Stuart, and\r\nits associations with the hapless queen give it a romantic interest.\r\nDuddingston (pop. 2023), once a quiet village, has become a centre of\r\nthe distilling and brewing industries. The parish church, effectively\r\nsituated on an eminence by the side of the lake, was the scene of the\r\nministration of the Rev. John Thomson (1778-1840), the landscape\r\npainter, who numbered Sir Walter Scott among his elders. Duddingston\r\nHouse is a seat of the duke of Abercorn. Liberton (pop. of parish,\r\n7233), a name that recalls the previous existence of a leper's hospital,\r\nis prominently situated on the rising ground to the south of Edinburgh,\r\nthe parish church being a conspicuous landmark. Adjoining is the village\r\nof Gilmerton (pop. 1482), which used to supply Edinburgh with yellow\r\nsand, when sanded floors were a feature in the humbler class of houses.\r\nPortobello (pop. 9180), being within 3 m. of the capital, must always\r\nenjoy a large share of public patronage, though it is not in such favour\r\nas a watering-place as it once was. Its beautiful stretch of sands is\r\nflanked by a promenade extending all the way to Joppa. The beach was at\r\none time used for the purpose of reviews of the yeomanry. The town dates\r\nfrom the middle of the 18th century, when a cottage was built by a\r\nsailor and named Portobello in commemoration of Admiral Vernon's victory\r\nin 1739. The place does a considerable trade in the making of bricks,\r\nbottles, earthenware, pottery, tiles and paper. Joppa, which adjoins it,\r\nhas salt works, but is chiefly a residential neighbourhood. Inveresk\r\n(pop. 2939), finely situated on the Esk some 6 m. from Edinburgh, is a\r\nquaint village with several old-fashioned mansions and beautiful\r\ngardens. Alexander Carlyle, the famous divine (1772-1805), whose\r\n_Memorials of his Times_ still affords fascinating reading, ministered\r\nfor fifty-five years in the parish church, in the graveyard of which\r\nlies David Macbeth Moir (1798-1851), who under the pen-name of \"Delta\"\r\nwrote _Mansie Wauch_, a masterpiece of Scots humour and pathos. Lasswade\r\n(pop. of parish, 9708), partly in the Pentlands, famous for its oatmeal,\r\nwas often the summer resort of Edinburgh worthies. Here Sir Walter Scott\r\nlived for six years and De Quincey for nineteen, and William Tennant\r\n(1784-1848), author of _Anster Fair_, was the parish dominie. Many\r\ninteresting mansions were and are in the vicinity, amongst them Melville\r\nCastle, the seat of the Dundas Melvilles, and Auchendinny, where Henry\r\nMackenzie, author of _The Man of Feeling_, resided. The two most\r\ncelebrated resorts, however, amongst the environs of Edinburgh are\r\nRoslin (pop. 1805) and Hawthornden. Roslin Castle is romantically\r\nsituated on the beautifully wooded precipitous banks of the Esk. It\r\ndates from the 12th century and is a plain, massive ruin,\r\narchitecturally insignificant. Partially destroyed by fire in 1447 and\r\nafterwards rebuilt, it was sacked in 1650 and again in 1688, and then\r\ngradually fell into decay. The chapel, higher up the bank, a relic of\r\ngreat beauty, was founded in 1446 by William St Clair, 3rd earl of\r\nOrkney. It is believed to be the chancel of what was intended to be a\r\nlarge church. Although it suffered at the hands of revolutionary\r\nfanatics in 1688, the damage was confined mainly to the external\r\nornament, and the chapel, owing to restoration in judicious taste, is\r\nnow in perfect condition. The Gothic details are wonderful examples of\r\nthe carver's skill, the wreathed \"Prentice's pillar\" being the subject\r\nof a well-known legend. The walk to Hawthornden, about 1-1/2 m. distant,\r\nthrough the lovely glen by the river-side, leads to the mansion of the\r\nDrummonds, perched high on a lofty cliff falling sheer to the stream.\r\nThe caverns in the sides of the precipice are said to have afforded\r\nWallace and other heroes (or outlaws) refuge in time of trouble, but the\r\nold house is most memorable as the home of the poet William Drummond,\r\nwho here welcomed Ben Jonson; the tree beneath which the two poets sat\r\nstill stands. Near Swanston, on the slopes of the Pentlands, where R.L.\r\nStevenson when a boy used to make holiday occasionally, is a golf-course\r\nwhich was laid out by the Lothianburn Club. The Pentland range contains\r\nmany points of interest and beauty, but these are mostly accessible only\r\nto the pedestrian, although the hills are crossed by roads, of which the\r\nchief are those by Glencorse burn and the Cauld Stane Slap. Habbie's\r\nHowe, the scene of Allan Ramsay's pastoral _The Gentle Shepherd_, is\r\nsome 2 m. from Carlops, and Rullion Green is noted as the field on which\r\nthe Covenanters were defeated in 1666. At Penicuik (pop. 5097), where\r\nthe Clerks were long the ruling family, S.R. Crockett was minister until\r\nhe formally devoted himself to fiction. The town is, industrially,\r\nremarkable for its paper mills and mines of coal and other minerals.\r\n\r\n_Communications._--The two trunk railways serving Edinburgh are the\r\nNorth British and the Caledonian. The North British station is Waverley,\r\nto which the trains of the Great Northern, North Eastern and the Midland\r\nsystems run from England. The Caledonian station is Princes Street,\r\nwhere the through trains from the London & North-Western system of\r\nEngland arrive. Leith, Granton and Grangemouth serve as the chief\r\npassenger seaports for Edinburgh. Tramways connect the different parts\r\nof the city with Leith, Newhaven, Portobello and Joppa; and the Suburban\r\nrailway, starting from Waverley station, returns by way of Restalrig,\r\nPortobello, Duddingston, Morningside and Haymarket. In summer, steamers\r\nply between Leith and Aberdour and other pleasure resorts; and there is\r\nalso a service to Alloa and Stirling. In the season brakes constantly\r\nrun to Queensferry (for the Forth Bridge) and to Roslin, and coaches to\r\nDalkeith, Loanhead and some Pentland villages.\r\n\r\n_Population._--In 1801 the number of inhabitants was 66,544; in 1851 it\r\nwas 160,302; in 1881 it was 234,402; and in 1901 it was 316,479. In 1900\r\nthe birth-rate was 26.90 per thousand, 7.8% of the births being\r\nillegitimate; the death-rate was 19.40 per thousand, and the\r\nmarriage-rate 10 per thousand.\r\n\r\nThe area of the city has been enlarged by successive extensions of its\r\nmunicipal boundaries, especially towards the west and south. An\r\nimportant accession of territory was gained in 1896, when portions of\r\nthe parishes of Liberton and Duddingston and the police burgh of\r\nPortobello were incorporated. Under the Edinburgh Corporation Act 1900,\r\na further addition of nearly 1800 acres was made. This embraced portions\r\nof South Leith parish (landward) and of Duddingston parish, including\r\nthe village of Restalrig and the ground lying on both sides of the main\r\nroad from Edinburgh to Portobello; and also part of Cramond parish, in\r\nwhich is contained the village and harbour of Granton. The total area of\r\nthe city is 10,597-1/2 acres. The increase in wealth may best be\r\nmeasured by the rise in assessed valuation. In 1880 the city rental was\r\nL1,727,740, in 1890 it was L2,106,395, and in 1900-1901 L2,807,122.\r\n\r\n_Government._--By the Redistribution Act of 1885 the city was divided\r\nfor parliamentary purposes into East, West, Central and South Edinburgh,\r\neach returning one member; the parliamentary and municipal boundaries\r\nare almost identical. The town council, which has its headquarters in\r\nthe Municipal Buildings in the Royal Exchange, consists of fifty\r\nmembers, a lord provost, seven bailies, a dean of guild, a treasurer, a\r\nconvener of trades, seven judges of police, and thirty-two councillors.\r\nThe corporation has acquired the gas-works, the cable tramways (leased\r\nto a company), the electric lighting of the streets, and the\r\nwater-supply from the Pentlands (reinforced by additional sources in the\r\nMoorfoot Hills and Talla Water). Among other duties, the corporation has\r\na share in the management of the university, and maintains the Calton\r\nHill observatory.\r\n\r\n_May Meetings._--During the establishment of Episcopacy in Scotland,\r\nEdinburgh was the seat of a bishop, and the ancient collegiate church of\r\nSt Giles rose to the dignity of a cathedral. But the annual meeting of\r\nthe General Assembly of the Church of Scotland at Edinburgh is now the\r\npublic manifestation of the predominance of Presbyterianism as the\r\nnational church. In May each year the sovereign appoints a\r\nrepresentative as lord high commissioner to the General Assembly of the\r\nEstablished Church, who takes up his abode usually in the palace of\r\nHolyrood, and thence proceeds to the High Church, and so to the assembly\r\nhall on the Castle Hill. The lord provost and magistrates offer to him\r\nthe keys of the city, and levees, receptions and state dinners revive in\r\nsome degree the ancient glories of Holyrood. The General Assembly of the\r\nUnited Free Church is usually held at the same time.\r\n\r\n_University._--The university of Edinburgh, the youngest of the Scottish\r\nuniversities, was founded in 1583 by a royal charter granted by James\r\nIV., and its rights, immunities and privileges have been remodelled,\r\nratified and extended at various periods. In 1621 an act of the Scottish\r\nparliament accorded to the university all rights and privileges enjoyed\r\nby other universities in the kingdom, and these were renewed under fresh\r\nguarantees in the treaty of union between England and Scotland, and in\r\nthe Act of Security. Important changes were made in the constitution by\r\nacts passed in 1858 and 1889. It was one of the first universities to\r\nadmit women students to its classes and degrees, and its _alumni_ are\r\nbrought into close bonds of sympathy and activity by a students' union.\r\nThe number of students averages nearly three thousand a year. As a\r\ncorporation it consists of a chancellor, vice-chancellor, lord rector\r\n(elected by the students every three years), principal, professors,\r\nregistered graduates and matriculated students. The chancellor is\r\nelected for life by the general council, of which he is head; and the\r\nrights of the city as the original founder have been recognized by\r\ngiving to the town council the election of four of the seven curators,\r\nwith whom rest the appointment of the principal, the patronage of\r\nseventeen of the chairs, and a share in other appointments. Along with\r\nthat of St Andrews, the university sends one member to parliament. While\r\nthe college, as such, bears the name of the College of King James, or\r\nKing's college, and James VI. is spoken of as its founder, it really\r\noriginated in the liberality of the citizens of Edinburgh. William\r\nLittle of Craigmillar, and his brother Clement Little, advocate, along\r\nwith James Lawson, the colleague and successor of John Knox, may justly\r\nbe regarded as true founders. In 1580 Clement Little gave all his books,\r\nthree hundred volumes, for the beginning of a library, and this was\r\naugmented by other valuable benefactions, one of the most interesting of\r\nwhich was the library of Drummond of Hawthornden. The library now\r\ncontains upwards of 220,000 volumes, and more than 7000 MSS. The\r\nbuildings of the university occupy the site of the ancient collegiate\r\nchurch of St. Mary in the Field (the \"Kirk of Field\"), the scene of the\r\nmurder of Darnley. The present structure, the foundation-stone of which\r\nwas laid in 1789, is a classical building, enclosing an extensive\r\nquadrangle. The older parts of it, including the east front, are from\r\nthe design of Robert Adam, his plans being revised and modified by W.H.\r\nPlayfair (1789-1857), but it was not till 1883 that the building was\r\ncompleted by the dome, crowned by the bronze figure of Youth bearing the\r\ntorch of Knowledge, on the facade in South Bridge Street. This edifice\r\naffords accommodation for the lecture rooms in the faculties of arts,\r\nlaw and theology, and for the museums and library. The opening up of the\r\nwide thoroughfare of Chambers Street, on the site of College Wynd and\r\nBrown and Argyll Squares, cleared the precincts of unsightly\r\nobstructions and unsavoury neighbours. The Royal Scottish Museum,\r\nstructurally united to the university, contains collections illustrative\r\nof industry, art, science and natural history; and Minto House college\r\nand Heriot-Watt college are practically adjuncts of the university. The\r\nlibrary hall was restored and decorated, largely through the generosity\r\nof Sir William Priestley (1829-1900), formerly M.P. for the university;\r\nwhile munificent additions to the academic funds and resources were made\r\nby the 15th earl of Moray (1840-1901), Sir William Fraser (1816-1898),\r\nand others. The university benefits also, like the other Scottish\r\nuniversities, from Mr Andrew Carnegie's endowment fund. The medical\r\nschool stands in Teviot Row, adjoining George Square and the Meadows. To\r\nthis spacious and well-equipped group of buildings the faculty of\r\nmedicine was removed from the college. The medical school is in the\r\nItalian Renaissance style from the designs of Sir Rowand Anderson. The\r\nmagnificent hall used for academic and public functions was the gift of\r\nWilliam M'Ewan, some time M.P. for the Central division of Edinburgh.\r\nClosely associated with the medical school, and separated from it by the\r\nMiddle Meadow Walk, is the Royal Infirmary, designed by David Bryce,\r\nR.S.A. (1803-1876), removed hither from Infirmary Street. Its wards, in\r\nwhich nearly ten thousand patients receive treatment annually, are\r\nlodged in a series of turreted pavilions, and cover a large space of\r\nground on the margin of the Meadows, from which, to make room for it,\r\nGeorge Watson's College--the most important of the Merchant Company\r\nschools--was removed to a site farther west, while the Sick Children's\r\nhospital was moved to the southern side of the Meadows.\r\n\r\n_Scientific Institutions._--The old Observatory is a quaint structure on\r\nCalton Hill, overlooking the district at the head of Leith Walk. The\r\nCity Observatory stands close by, and on Blackford Hill is the newer\r\nbuilding of the Royal Observatory. The Astronomer-Royal for Scotland\r\nalso holds the chair of practical astronomy.\r\n\r\nThe museum and lecture-rooms of the Royal College of Surgeons occupy a\r\nhandsome classical building in Nicolson Street. The college is an\r\nancient corporate body, with a charter of the year 1505, and exercises\r\nthe powers of instructing in surgery and of giving degrees. Its\r\ngraduates also give lectures on the various branches of medicine and\r\nscience requisite for the degree of doctor of medicine, and those\r\nextra-academical courses are recognized, under certain restrictions, by\r\nthe University Court, as qualifying for the degree. The museum contains\r\na valuable collection of anatomical and surgical preparations.\r\n\r\nThe Royal College of Physicians is another learned body organized, with\r\nspecial privileges, by a charter of incorporation granted by Charles II.\r\nin 1681. In their hall in Queen Street are a valuable library and a\r\nmuseum of materia medica. But the college as such takes no part in the\r\neducational work of the university.\r\n\r\n_Educational Institutions._--After the Disruption in 1843, and the\r\nformation of the Free Church, New College was founded in connexion with\r\nit for training students in theology. Since the amalgamation of the\r\nUnited Presbyterian and the Free Churches, under the designation of the\r\nUnited Free Church of Scotland, New College is utilized by both bodies.\r\nNew College buildings, designed in the Pointed style of the 16th\r\ncentury, and erected on the site of the palace of Mary of Guise, occupy\r\na prominent position at the head of the Mound.\r\n\r\nEdinburgh has always possessed exceptional educational facilities. The\r\nRoyal high school, the burgh school _par excellence_, dates from the\r\n16th century, but the beautiful Grecian buildings on the southern face\r\nof Calton Hill, opened in 1829, are its third habitation. It was not\r\nuntil 1825, when the Edinburgh Academy was opened, that it encountered\r\nserious rivalry. Fettes College, an imposing structure in a 16th-century\r\nsemi-Gothic style, designed by David Bryce and called after its founder\r\nSir William Fettes (1750-1836), is organized on the model of the great\r\nEnglish public schools. Merchiston Academy, housed in the old castle of\r\nNapier, the inventor of logarithms, is another institution conducted on\r\nEnglish public school lines. For many generations the charitable\r\nfoundations for the teaching and training of youth were a conspicuous\r\nfeature in the economy of the city. Foremost among them was the hospital\r\nfounded by George Heriot--the \"Jingling Geordie\" of Scott's _Fortunes of\r\nNigel_--the goldsmith and banker of James VI. At his death in 1624\r\nHeriot left his estate in trust to the magistrates and ministers of\r\nEdinburgh for the maintenance and teaching of poor fatherless sons of\r\nfreemen. The quadrangular edifice in Lauriston, sometimes ascribed to\r\nInigo Jones, is one of the noblest buildings in the city. Even earlier\r\nthan Heriot's hospital was the Merchant Maiden hospital, dating from\r\n1605, which gave to the daughters of merchants similar advantages to\r\nthose which Heriot's secured for burgesses' sons. In 1738 George\r\nWatson's hospital for boys was founded; then followed the Trades' Maiden\r\nhospital for burgesses' daughters, John Watson's, Daniel Stewart's, the\r\nOrphans', Gillespie's,[2] Donaldson's[3] hospitals, and other\r\ninstitutions founded by successful merchants of the city, in which poor\r\nchildren of various classes were lodged, boarded and educated. Nearly\r\nall these buildings are characterized by remarkable distinction and\r\nbeauty of design. This is especially true of Donaldson's hospital at the\r\nHaymarket, which has accommodation for three hundred children. As the\r\nNew Town expanded, the Heriot Trust--whose revenues were greatly\r\nbenefited thereby--erected day-schools in different districts, in which\r\nthousands of infants and older children received a free education, and,\r\nin cases of extreme poverty, a money grant towards maintenance. Public\r\nopinion as to the \"hospital\" system of board and education, however,\r\nunderwent a revolutionary change after the Education Act of 1872\r\nintroduced school boards, and the Merchant Company--acting as governors\r\nfor most of the institutions--determined to board out the children on\r\nthe foundation with families in the town, and convert the buildings into\r\nadequately equipped primary and secondary day-schools. This\r\nroot-and-branch policy proved enormously successful, and George Watson's\r\ncollege, Stewart's college, Queen Street ladies' college, George Square\r\nladies' college, Gillespie's school, and others, rapidly took a high\r\nplace among the educational institutions of the city. Nor did the Heriot\r\nTrust neglect the claims of technical and higher education. The\r\nHeriot-Watt college is subsidized by the Trust, and Heriot's hospital is\r\noccupied as a technical school. Concurrently with this activity in\r\nhigher branches, the school board provided a large number of handsome\r\nbuildings in healthy surroundings. The Church of Scotland and the United\r\nFree Church have training colleges.\r\n\r\n_Charities._--Besides the Royal Infirmary there are a considerable\r\nnumber of more or less specialized institutions, two of the most\r\nimportant being situated at Craiglockhart. On the Easter Hill stands the\r\nRoyal Edinburgh asylum for the insane, which formerly occupied a site in\r\nMorningside, while the City infectious diseases hospital is situated at\r\nColinton Mains. The Royal blind asylum at Powburn in its earlier days\r\ntenanted humbler quarters in Nicolson Street. Chalmers's hospital in\r\nLauriston was founded in 1836 by George Chalmers for the reception of\r\nthe sick and injured. The home for incurables is situated in Salisbury\r\nPlace. The infirmary convalescents are sent to the convalescent house in\r\nCorstorphine. Other institutions are the Royal hospital for sick\r\nchildren, the home for crippled children, the Royal maternity hospital,\r\nand the deaf and dumb asylum. Though Trinity hospital no longer exists\r\nas a hospital with resident pensioners, the trustees disburse annually\r\npensions to certain poor burgesses and their wives and children; and the\r\ntrust controlling the benevolent branch of the Gillespie hospital\r\nendowment is similarly administered.\r\n\r\n_Industries._--Although Edinburgh is a residential rather than a\r\nmanufacturing or commercial centre, the industries which it has are\r\nimportant and flourishing. From 1507, when Walter Chapman, the Scottish\r\nCaxton, set up the first press, to the present day, printing has enjoyed\r\na career of almost continuous vitality, and the great houses of R. & R.\r\nClark, T. & A. Constable, the Ballantyne Press, Morrison & Gibb,\r\nTurnbull & Spears, and others, admirably maintain the traditional\r\nreputation of the Edinburgh press. Publishing, on the other hand, has\r\ndrifted away, only a few leading houses--such as those of Blackwood,\r\nChambers and Nelson--still making the Scottish capital their\r\nheadquarters. Mapmakers, typefounders, bookbinders and lithographers all\r\ncontribute their share to the prosperity of the city. Brewing is an\r\nindustry of exceptional vigour, Edinburgh ale being proverbially good.\r\nThe brewers and distillers, such as M'Ewan, Usher and Ure, have been\r\namongst the most generous benefactors of the city. The arts and crafts\r\nassociated with furniture work, paper-making and coach-building may also\r\nbe specified, whilst tanneries, glassworks, india-rubber and vulcanite\r\nfactories, brass-founding, machinery works, the making of biscuits,\r\ntea-bread and confectionery are all prominent. In consequence of the\r\nlarge influx of tourists every year the North British and Caledonian\r\nrailway companies give employment to an enormous staff. Building and the\r\nallied trades are chronically brisk, owing to the constant development\r\nof the city. Fine white freestone abounds in the immediate vicinity (as\r\nat Craigleith, from the vast quarry of which, now passing into disuse,\r\nthe stone for much of the New Town was obtained) and furnishes excellent\r\nbuilding material; while the hard trap rock, with which the stratified\r\nsandstones of the Coal formation have been extensively broken up and\r\noverlaid, supplies good materials for paving and road-making. On this\r\naccount quarrying is another industry which is seldom dormant. Owing to\r\nthe great changes effected during the latter part of the 19th century,\r\nsome of the old markets were demolished and the system of centralizing\r\ntrade was not wholly revived. The Waverley Market for vegetables and\r\nfruit presents a busy scene in the early morning, and is used for\r\nmonster meetings and promenade and popular concerts. Slaughter-houses,\r\ncattle markets and grain markets have been erected at Gorgie, thus\r\nobviating the driving of flocks and herds through the streets, which was\r\nconstantly objected to. An infantry regiment is always stationed in the\r\ncastle, and there are in addition the barracks at Piers-hill (or \"Jock's\r\nLodge\"), half-way between Edinburgh and Portobello.\r\n\r\n_Social Life._--Edinburgh society still retains a certain old-fashioned\r\nScottish exclusiveness. It has been said that the city is \"east-windy\"\r\nand the folk \"west-endy.\" But this criticism needs judicious\r\nqualification. The local patriotism and good taste of the citizens have\r\nregulated recreation and have also preserved in pristine vigour many\r\npeculiarly Scottish customs and pastimes. Classical concerts and\r\nconcerts of the better sort, chiefly held in the M'Ewan and Music Halls,\r\nare well attended, and lectures are patronized to a degree unknown in\r\nmost towns. In theatrical matters in the old days of stock companies the\r\nverdict of an Edinburgh audience was held to make or mar an actor or a\r\nplay. This is no longer the case, but the Lyceum theatre in Grindlay\r\nStreet and the Theatre Royal at the head of Leith Walk give good\r\nperformances. Variety entertainments are also in vogue, and in Nicolson\r\nStreet and elsewhere there are good music halls. Outdoor recreations\r\nhave always been pursued with zest. The public golf-course on Braid\r\nHills and the private courses of the Lothianburn club at Swanston and\r\nthe Barnton club at Barnton are usually full on Saturdays and holidays.\r\nThe numerous bowling-greens are regularly frequented and are among the\r\nbest in Scotland--the first Australian team of bowlers that visited the\r\nmother country (in 1901) pronouncing the green in Lutton Place the\r\nfinest on which they had played. Cricket is played by the university\r\nstudents, at the schools, and by private clubs, of which the Grange is\r\nthe oldest and best. In winter the game of curling is played on\r\nDuddingston Loch, and Dunsappie, St Margaret's Loch, Lochend and other\r\nsheets of water are covered with skaters. Rugby football is in high\r\nfavour, Edinburgh being commonly the scene of the international matches\r\nwhen the _venue_ falls to Scotland. Hockey claims many votaries, there\r\nusually being on New Year's day a match at shinty, or _camanachd_,\r\nbetween opposing teams of Highlanders resident in the city. The central\r\npublic baths in Infirmary Street, with branch establishments in other\r\nparts of the town, including Portobello, are largely resorted to, and\r\nthe proximity of the Firth of Forth induces the keener swimmers to visit\r\nGranton every morning. Facilities for boating are limited (excepting on\r\nthe Forth), but rowing clubs find opportunity for practice and races on\r\nthe Union Canal, where, however, sailing is scarcely possible. Edinburgh\r\nmaintains few newspapers, but the _Scotsman_, which may be said to reign\r\nalone, has enjoyed a career of almost uninterrupted prosperity, largely\r\nin consequence of a succession of able editors, like Charles Maclaren,\r\nAlexander Russel, Robert Wallace and Charles Cooper. The _Edinburgh\r\nEvening News_ and the _Evening Dispatch_ are popular sheets. In the past\r\nthe _Edinburgh Evening Courant_, the chief organ of the Tory party, of\r\nwhich James Hannay was editor for a few years, had a high reputation.\r\n_The Witness_, edited by Hugh Miller, the _Daily Review_, edited first\r\nby J.B. Manson and afterwards by Henry Kingsley, and the _Scottish\r\nLeader_, were conducted more or less as Liberal organs with a distinct\r\nbias in favour of the then Free Church, but none of these was\r\nlong-lived. Volunteering has always attracted the younger men, and the\r\nhighest awards at Wimbledon and Bisley have been won by the Queen's\r\nEdinburgh.\r\n\r\n_History._--In remote times the seaboard from the Tyne to the Forth was\r\noccupied by the Ottadeni, a Welsh tribe of the Brigantes, the territory\r\nimmediately to the west of it being peopled by the Gadeni. It is\r\nprobable that the Ottadeni built a fort or camp on the rock on which\r\nEdinburgh Castle now stands, which was thus the nucleus around which, in\r\ncourse of time, grew a considerable village. Under the protection of\r\nthe hill-fort, a native settlement was established on the ridge running\r\ndown to the valley at the foot of Salisbury Crags, and another hamlet,\r\naccording to William Maitland (1693-1757), the earliest historian of\r\nEdinburgh, was founded in the area at the north-western base of the\r\nrock, a district that afterwards became the parish of St Cuthbert, the\r\noldest in the city. The Romans occupied the country for more than three\r\nhundred years, as is evidenced by various remains; but James Grant\r\n(1822-1887), in _Old and New Edinburgh_, doubts whether they ever built\r\non the castle rock. When they withdrew, the British tribes reasserted\r\ntheir sway, and some authorities go so far as to suggest that Arthur was\r\none of their kings. The southern Picts ultimately subdued the Britons,\r\nand the castle became their chief stronghold until they were overthrown\r\nin 617 (or 629) by the Saxons under Edwin, king of Northumbria, from\r\nwhom the name of Edinburgh is derived. Symeon of Durham (854) calls it\r\nEdwinesburch, and includes the church of St Cuthbert within the\r\nbishopric of Lindisfarne. Its Gaelic name was Dunedin. This name is\r\nprobably a translation of the Saxon name. James Grant's view that it may\r\nhave been the earlier name of the castle, from _dun_ (\"the fort\"), and\r\n_edin_ (\"on the slope\"), conflicts with the more generally received\r\nopinion that the Britons knew the fortress as _Castelh Mynedh Agnedh_\r\n(\"the hill of the plain\"), a designation once wrongly interpreted as the\r\n\"castle of the maidens\" (_castrum puellarum_), in allusion to the\r\nsupposed fact that the Pictish princesses were lodged within it during\r\ntheir education. In the 16th century the latinized form Edina was\r\ninvented and has been used chiefly by poets, once notably by Burns,\r\nwhose \"Address\" begins \"Edina! Scotia's darling seat.\" Long after\r\nEdwin's conquest the lowland continued to be debatable territory held by\r\nuncertain tenure, but at length it was to a large extent settled anew by\r\nAnglo-Saxon and Norman colonists under Malcolm Canmore and his sons.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Malcolm Canmore the castle included the king's palace.\r\nThere his pious queen, Margaret, the grand-niece of Edward the\r\nConfessor, died in 1093. It continued to be a royal residence during the\r\nreigns of her three sons, and hence the first rapid growth of the upper\r\ntown may be referred to the 12th century. The parish church of St Giles\r\nis believed to have been erected in the reign of Alexander I., about\r\n1110, and the huge Norman keep of the castle, built by his younger\r\nbrother, David I., continued to be known as David's Tower till its\r\ndestruction in the siege of 1572. Soon after his accession to the\r\nScottish throne David I. founded the abbey of Holyrood (1128), which\r\nfrom an early date received the court as its guests. But notwithstanding\r\nthe attractions of the abbey and the neighbouring chase, the royal\r\npalace continued for centuries to be within the fortress, and there both\r\nthe Celtic and Stuart kings frequently resided. Edinburgh was long an\r\nexposed frontier town within a territory only ceded to Malcolm II. about\r\n1020; and even under the earlier Stuart kings it was still regarded as a\r\nborder stronghold. Hence, though the village of Canongate grew up beside\r\nthe abbey of David I., and Edinburgh was a place of sufficient\r\nimportance to be reckoned one of the four principal burghs as a\r\njudicatory for all commercial matters, nevertheless, even so late as\r\n1450, when it became for the first time a walled town, it did not extend\r\nbeyond the upper part of the ridge which slopes eastwards from the\r\ncastle. So long, however, as its walls formed the boundary, and space\r\ntherefore was limited, the citizens had to provide house-room by\r\nbuilding dwellings of many storeys. These tall tenements on both sides\r\nof what is now High Street and Canongate are still a prominent\r\ncharacteristic of the Old Town. The streets were mostly very narrow, the\r\nmain street from the castle to Holyrood Palace and the Cowgate alone\r\npermitting the passage of wheeled carriages. In the narrow \"wynds\" the\r\nnobility and gentry paid their visits in sedan chairs, and proceeded in\r\nfull dress to the assemblies and balls, which were conducted with\r\naristocratic exclusiveness in an alley on the south side of High Street,\r\ncalled the Assembly Close, and in the assembly rooms in the West Bow.\r\nBeyond the walls lay the burghs of Calton, Easter and Wester Portsburgh,\r\nthe villages of St Cuthbert's, Moutrie's Hill, Broughton, Canonmills,\r\nSilvermills and Deanhaugh--all successively swallowed up in the\r\nextension of the modern city. The seaport of Leith, though a distinct\r\nburgh, governed by its own magistrates, and electing its own\r\nrepresentative to parliament, has also on its southern side become\r\npractically united to its great neighbour.\r\n\r\nThe other three royal burghs associated with Edinburgh were Stirling,\r\nRoxburgh and Berwick; and their enactments form the earliest existing\r\ncollected body of Scots law. The determination of Edinburgh as the\r\nnational capital, and as the most frequent scene of parliamentary\r\nassemblies, dates from the death of James I. in 1436. Of the thirteen\r\nparliaments summoned by that sovereign, only one, the last, was held at\r\nEdinburgh, but his assassination in the Blackfriars' monastery at Perth\r\nled to the abrupt transfer of the court and capital from the Tay to the\r\nForth. The coronation of James II. was celebrated in Holyrood Abbey\r\ninstead of at Scone, and the widowed queen took up her residence, with\r\nthe young king, in the castle. Of fourteen parliaments summoned during\r\nthis reign, only one was held at Perth, five met at Stirling and the\r\nrest at Edinburgh; and, notwithstanding the favour shown for Stirling as\r\na royal residence in the following reign, every one of the parliaments\r\nof James III. was held at Edinburgh. James II. conferred on the city\r\nvarious privileges relating to the holding of fairs and markets, and the\r\nlevying of customs; and by a royal charter of 1452 he gave it\r\npre-eminence over the other burghs. Further immunities and privileges\r\nwere granted by James III.; and by a precept of 1482, known as the\r\nGolden Charter, he bestowed on the provost and magistrates the\r\nhereditary office of sheriff, with power to hold courts, to levy fines,\r\nand to impose duties on all merchandise landed at the port of Leith.\r\nThose privileges were renewed and extended by various sovereigns, and\r\nespecially by a general charter granted by James VI. in 1603.\r\n\r\nJames III. was a great builder, and, in the prosperous era which\r\nfollowed his son's accession to the throne, the town reached the open\r\nvalley to the south, with the Cowgate as its chief thoroughfare. But the\r\ndeath of James IV. in 1513, along with other disastrous results of the\r\nbattle of Flodden, brought this era of prosperity to an abrupt close.\r\nThe citizens hastened to construct a second line of wall, enclosing the\r\nCowgate and the heights beyond, since occupied by Greyfriars churches\r\nand Heriot's hospital, but still excluding the Canongate, as pertaining\r\nto the abbey of Holyrood. In the 16th century the movements connected\r\nwith John Knox and Mary, queen of Scots, made Edinburgh a castle of much\r\nactivity. With the departure, however, of the sixth James to fill the\r\nEnglish throne in 1603, the town lost for a long period its influence\r\nand prestige. Matters were not bettered by the Act of Union signed in a\r\ncellar in High Street in 1707, amidst the execrations of the people, and\r\nit was not till the hopes of the Jacobites were blasted at Culloden\r\n(1746) that the townsfolk began to accept the inevitable. This epoch,\r\nwhen grass grew even in High Street, long lingered in the popular memory\r\nas the \"dark age.\"\r\n\r\nBy the accession of George III. (1760), Edinburgh showed signs of\r\nrevived enterprise. In 1763 the first North Bridge, connecting the Old\r\nTown with the sloping ground on which afterwards stood the Register\r\nHouse and the theatre in Shakespeare Square, was opened; a little later\r\nthe Nor' Loch was partially drained, and the bridging of the Cowgate in\r\n1785 encouraged expansion southwards. Towards the end of the 18th\r\ncentury the New Town began to take shape on the grand, if formal, lines\r\nwhich had been planned by James Craig (d. 1795), the architect, nephew\r\nof the poet Thomson, and the erection of Regent Bridge in Waterloo Place\r\n(formally opened in 1819 on the occasion of the visit of Prince Leopold,\r\nafterwards king of the Belgians) gave access to Calton Hill. The\r\ncreation of Princes Street, one of the most beautiful thoroughfares in\r\nthe world, led to further improvement. The earth and debris from the\r\nexcavation of the sites for the houses in this and adjoining streets had\r\nbeen \"dumped\" in the centre of the drained Nor' Loch. This unsightly\r\nmass of rubbish lay for a while as an eye-sore, until the happy thought\r\narose of converting it into a broad way joining the new road at Hanover\r\nStreet with the Old Town at the Lawnmarket. Upon this street, which\r\ndivides Princes Street and its gardens into east and west, and which\r\nreceived the title of the Mound, were erected the National Gallery and\r\nthe Royal Institution. Speaking generally, the New Town was resorted to\r\nby professional men--lawyers, doctors and artists,--and in its principal\r\nstreets will be found the head offices of the leading banks and\r\ninsurance offices, all lodged in buildings of remarkable architectural\r\npretensions. The Commercial, the Union and the Clydesdale banks are in\r\nGeorge Street, the National Bank of Scotland, the Royal Bank of\r\nScotland, and the British Linen Company's Bank are in St Andrew Square,\r\nthe Bank of Scotland is at the head of the Mound. The extensive building\r\noperations engaged in by the town council in the early part of the 19th\r\ncentury resulted in the insolvency of the city in 1833. The property of\r\nthe corporation was valued at L271,658 against a debt of L425,195, which\r\nwas compounded for by the issue of 3% annuity bonds--the loss to the\r\ncreditors amounting to 25% of their claims.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the progress of letters, science and learning manifested the\r\nrecovery of the city. The names of Knox (d. 1572), Buchanan (1582),\r\nAlexander Montgomery (1605), Drummond of Hawthornden (1649), Allan\r\nRamsay (1757), Smollett (1771), Fergusson (1774), and Burns (1796),\r\ncarried on the literary associations of the Scottish capital nearly to\r\nthe close of the 18th century, when various causes combined to give them\r\nnew significance and value. The university was served by a body of\r\nteachers and investigators who won for it a prominent position among\r\nEuropean schools. Then succeeded the era of Scott's _Marmion_ and _The\r\nLady of the Lake_, followed by the Waverley novels and the foundation of\r\n_Blackwood's Magazine_ and the _Edinburgh Review_.\r\n\r\nModern conditions have changed the character of Edinburgh society. In\r\nScott's early days a journey to London was beset with difficulties and\r\neven dangers; but railways have now brought it within a few hours'\r\ndistance, and Scottish artists and literary men are tempted to seek a\r\nwider field. Nevertheless, the influence of the past survives in many\r\nways. Edinburgh is not markedly a manufacturing city, but preserves its\r\ncharacter as the Scottish capital.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--James Grant, _Old and New Edinburgh_ (London, 1880 et\r\n  seq.); W.

Its area is 234,339 acres or 3662 sq. m. The island of Cramond\r\nbelongs to the county. There are no mountains, but the Pentland Hills\r\nadvance boldly from the south-west to within 5 m. of the sea. The\r\nloftiest summits are Scald Law (1898 ft.), Carnethy (1881), West and\r\nEast Cairn Hill (1844 and 1839), and West Kip (1806). They are generally\r\nof rounded form, and covered with heath or grass. The Moorfoot Hills, in\r\nthe south-east, are a continuation of the Lammermuirs, and attain in\r\nBlackhope Scar a height of 2136 ft. Of more or less isolated eminences\r\nthere are the Braid Hills (698 ft.), Blackford Hill (500), Arthur's Seat\r\n(822), Corstorphine Hill (500)--all practically within Edinburgh--and\r\nDalmahoy Craig (800), 7 m. south-west of the city. Of the rivers the\r\nGala rises on the south-east of the Moorfoot Hills and flows south to\r\njoin the Tweed, and the Tyne after a course of 7 m. passes into\r\nHaddingtonshire. All the others flow into the Firth of Forth. Of these\r\nthe Esk, which is the longest, drains the district between the Pentlands\r\nand the Moorfoot Hills, and empties into the sea at Musselburgh. The\r\nsouthern branch has its source near Blackhope Scar, receives on its\r\nright Gore Water and, on its left, Dalhousie Burn, and flows past\r\nNewbattle Abbey; the northern rises in the Pentlands, and proceeds\r\nthrough much picturesque scenery past Penicuik, Roslin, Hawthornden and\r\nLasswade; the two streams uniting within the grounds of Dalkeith Palace.\r\nBraid Burn from Capelaw Hill passes between the Braid Hills and\r\nBlackford Hill, and reaches the sea at Portobello. The Water of Leith,\r\nwith its head streams on the western slope of the Pentlands, flows past\r\nBalerno, Currie, Juniper Green, Colinton, Edinburgh and Leith. The\r\nAlmond, rising in Lanarkshire, and its right-hand tributary, Breich\r\nWater, form the boundary between Midlothian and Linlithgowshire. Several\r\nof these streams, especially the Esk and the Water of Leith, furnish\r\nmuch water power. The only loch is that at Duddingston, but there are\r\nseveral large reservoirs connected with the water supply of Edinburgh.\r\nCobbinshaw reservoir, situated at the head of Bog Burn, a tributary of\r\nthe Almond, is used for the supply of the Union Canal connecting the\r\nForth with the Clyde.\r\n\r\n  _Geology._--The southern portion of the county, embracing the Moorfoot\r\n  Hills and a large part of the catchment basin of the Gala Water, lies\r\n  within the Silurian tableland of the south of Scotland. From Bowland\r\n  northwards to Crookston in the Gala valley the Silurian strata are\r\n  mainly of Tarannon age and consist of greywackes, grits, flags and\r\n  shales, with thin dark seams which yield graptolites sparingly. To the\r\n  north of this area, older sediments, comprising Arenig cherts, black\r\n  shales, greywackes and grits of Llandeilo and Caradoc age, rise from\r\n  underneath the Tarannon strata and spread over the hills north to the\r\n  margin of the tableland. In some of the folds of Arenig cherts diabase\r\n  lavas appear, which occupy small lenticular areas. All the Silurian\r\n  strata are repeated by folds striking north-east and south-west and\r\n  frequently dipping in one direction, to the north-west as in the Gala\r\n  valley. North of the Silurian tableland and within the area occupied\r\n  by the younger palaeozoic rocks of the Pentland Hills, there are\r\n  various inliers of Upper Silurian strata. These isolated patches occur\r\n  (1) in the North Esk section, (2) at Loganlee reservoir, (3) near\r\n  Bavelaw Castle, and (4) in Bavelaw Burn. The section in the North Esk\r\n  is by far the most complete, as the strata embrace Wenlock, Ludlow and\r\n  Downtonian rocks with a north-east strike similar to that of the beds\r\n  in the Silurian tableland. The Wenlock rocks have yielded a rich suite\r\n  of organic remains. In the Pentland Hills the folded and denuded\r\n  Silurian strata are covered unconformably by Lower Old Red Sandstone\r\n  rocks, comprising conglomerates and red sandstones, which are\r\n  succeeded by a great volcanic series, the latter extending from the\r\n  West Kip Hill to the Braid Hills. The pebbles of the basal\r\n  conglomerates are derived chiefly from the underlying platform of\r\n  greywackes and shales and from the Radiolarian cherts and volcanic\r\n  rocks in the tableland to the south. The contemporaneous igneous rocks\r\n  include olivine basalts, andesites, trachytes, rhyolites and tuffs,\r\n  which are pierced by the microgranite of the Black Hill and by several\r\n  vents filled with agglomerate, as near Swanston.\r\n\r\n  The Upper Old Red Sandstone rests unconformably on all older\r\n  formations. The red sandstones and cornstones of this division form\r\n  the Cairn Hills, and are traceable north-eastwards along the\r\n  north-west slope of the Pentland Hills towards the Clubbiedean\r\n  reservoir, where they are overlapped by Carboniferous strata. They\r\n  occupy the south part of the city of Edinburgh, they occur in the\r\n  lower slope of Salisbury Crags, and south by Craigmillar and Liberton\r\n  towards Mortonhall. Recently the horizon of these beds has been proved\r\n  by the discovery of fish remains (_Holoptychius_), a zonal form of the\r\n  Upper Old Red Sandstone. The remainder of the county embracing the\r\n  fertile low ground west of the city of Edinburgh and along the basin\r\n  of the Esk is occupied by Carboniferous strata and various igneous\r\n  rocks associated with that formation. The Pentland Hills, formed of\r\n  older Palaeozoic deposits, appear as a prominent ridge, throwing off\r\n  the Carboniferous beds to the north-west and south-east. In the former\r\n  direction only the Calciferous Sandstone series is represented, and in\r\n  the latter all the Carboniferous divisions are well developed. The\r\n  lowest subdivision of the Calciferous Sandstone series, consisting of\r\n  sandstones, red and green shales, marls and cement-stones, appears in\r\n  the ridge of the old part of the city between the Castle and Holyrood,\r\n  in the Hunter's Bog and on the north-west side of the Pentland Hills.\r\n  Intercalated in this series near the top, there are interbedded\r\n  volcanic rocks, comprising olivine basalts, mugearites, tuffs and\r\n  agglomerates, which form conspicuous features on Arthur's Seat, on\r\n  Calton Hill, at Craiglockhart and Corston Hill south of Mid Calder.\r\n  Next in order come the Granton sandstones and Wardie shales, which are\r\n  best seen on the shore at Granton, and extend up the Water of Leith in\r\n  the direction of Colinton, where they are succeeded by the Hailes\r\n  sandstone. The upper portion of the Calciferous Sandstone series,\r\n  overlying the Hailes sandstone, embraces the valuable oil-shales,\r\n  which give rise to one of the chief industries of the Lothians.\r\n  Recently, however, it has been proved that some of the bands in the\r\n  Wardie shales give a low yield of oil and sulphate of ammonia. The\r\n  oil-shale-fields in the county lie partly along its west margin from\r\n  Mid Calder south to Breich and also on the south-east side of the\r\n  Pentland Hills between Straiton and Carlops along the west side of the\r\n  Midlothian basin. From an economic point of view the Midlothian\r\n  coalfield is of special importance, the strata being arranged in a\r\n  syncline, the long axis of which trends north-north-east and\r\n  south-south-west. In the centre of the basin lie the Coal-Measures\r\n  covered by the barren red sandstone of Dalkeith, probably on the same\r\n  horizon as the red sandstones of Wemyss in Fife (Middle\r\n  Coal-Measures). The underlying Millstone Grit and Carboniferous\r\n  Limestone series with its middle-coal-bearing group rise from\r\n  underneath the Coal-Measures, forming parallel bands curving round the\r\n  basin. Along the west side of the syncline, the strata dip at high\r\n  angles to the south-east, are sometimes vertical and even in some\r\n  cases inverted, while in the centre they become flat and rise at\r\n  gentle angles towards the east. The Coal Measures and the coal-bearing\r\n  group of the Carboniferous Limestone series contain numerous valuable\r\n  coals and ironstones, and there still remains a large field for\r\n  development. The intrusive igneous rocks forming prominent features in\r\n  the county are divisible into two main groups, which are separated\r\n  from each other by a considerable interval of time. The coarse\r\n  agglomerate filling the old volcano on the top of Arthur's Seat is\r\n  associated with the eruption of the volcanic rocks of Calciferous\r\n  Sandstone age near Edinburgh. The fine grained basalt appearing as a\r\n  plug on the Castle Rock closely resembles the basalt on the top of\r\n  Arthur's Seat, and is likewise of the same age. The intrusive sheets\r\n  of Salisbury Crags and Corstorphine Hill composed of olivine-dolerite\r\n  belong to the same general period. But the quartz-dolerites\r\n  represented by the Ratho sill are in all probability of late\r\n  Carboniferous age.\r\n\r\n_Climate and Agriculture._--In the hill country the average rainfall is\r\n37.4 in., but on the coast only 28.4 in. The average temperature ranges\r\nfrom 38 deg. F. in January to 59 deg.5 in July, the mean for the year\r\nbeing 47.7. The north-east and easterly winds prevailing in spring are,\r\nespecially in Edinburgh and its vicinity, remarkable for their cold and\r\nblighting character. Excepting in the uplands, snow seldom lies long,\r\nbut frosts sometimes occur at night as late as the beginning of June,\r\nand severe enough to destroy the young shoots of seedling trees in\r\nnurseries. But the winter is often astonishingly mild. The common\r\nsnowdrop (_Galanthus nivalis_) blossoms as early as the 25th of January,\r\nthe kidney liverleaf (_Hepatica triloba_) by the 31st of January and the\r\nrhododendron (_R. nobleanum_) by the 25th of February. On the shores of\r\nthe Forth along the Almond and the Esk, and on some of the richer flats,\r\ngrain crops ripen early; 2 m. nearer the hills and 200 ft. higher the\r\nharvest is ten days later; and at 600 ft. still another week later. High\r\nfarming is the rule in the three Lothians. All the area on which wheat\r\ncan be profitably grown is so occupied; oats, however, is the\r\npredominant grain crop, though barley is also raised. Turnips and\r\npotatoes are the chief roots, and beans are grown to a limited extent. A\r\nlarge area is occupied by pasture and sown grasses, fallow land having\r\npractically disappeared. Near Edinburgh sewage farming has been largely\r\ndeveloped. There are 200 acres at Craigentinny between Restalrig and the\r\nForth, besides smaller tracts under similar treatment at Lochend, Dalry\r\nand the Grange. The produce consists principally of natural grasses.\r\nSheep and cattle raising is an important pursuit. In the neighbourhood\r\nof the capital dairy farming is conducted on an extensive scale. Horse\r\nbreeding flourishes, several of the studs being of excellent character,\r\nClydesdales predominating. Pig-keeping has grown considerably and\r\npoultry-farming is carried on near Edinburgh. The nursery gardens are\r\nextensive, and, besides market gardening, which prospers near the\r\ncapital, there are many orchards.\r\n\r\n_Other Industries._--Though as a whole not a mining county, Midlothian\r\npossesses some mineral wealth. Coal is extensively mined at various\r\npoints on the North Esk, like Penicuik, Loanhead, Bonnyrigg, Eskbank and\r\nat Gorebridge, Newbattle, Newbigging, Niddrie, Gilmerton, Mid and West\r\nCalder. Ironstone is obtained chiefly at Lasswade and Penicuik and\r\nfire-clay occurs at various points. In the vicinity of West Calder there\r\nis a large amount of valuable oil-bearing shale. Limestone is of\r\nfrequent occurrence--at Esperston, Cousland, Crichton near Dalkeith,\r\nBurdiehouse, Gilmerton near Edinburgh, the Camps in Kirknewton parish,\r\nand at Muirieston and Leven Seat in the south-west. Freestone is\r\nquarried at Craigleith, Hailes, Redhall and Craigmillar. It is used for\r\npavements and stairs, and for the great docks at Leith. Barnton Mount\r\nsupplies large blocks of whinstone, also used for docks and for\r\nfortifications; the causeway stones for the streets of Edinburgh are\r\nmainly procured from the quarries at Ratho; and a number of smaller\r\nquarries for the supply of road-material are scattered throughout the\r\ncounty. Owing no doubt to the growth of printing and publishing in the\r\nmetropolis, the chief manufacturing industry in Midlothian is\r\npaper-making. Most of the mills are extensive and equipped with the most\r\nmodern processes and have an enormous yearly output. The most important\r\nmills, some of them dating from the beginning of the 18th century, are\r\nsituated on the North Esk between Penicuik and Musselburgh, and on the\r\nSouth Esk at Newbattle. At Balerno, Currie, Colinton and elsewhere on\r\nthe Water of Leith there are several mills, as well as near Mid Calder\r\nand at Portobello. The ancient vat-mill called Peggy's Mill, at Cramond,\r\nproduces handmade papers. There are carpet factories on the Esk at\r\nRoslin and at Lasswade. The manufacture of gunpowder is also carried on\r\nat Roslin, the works being distributed in recesses on the Esk. Iron\r\nfoundries exist at Dalkeith, Westfield, Loanhead, Penicuik, Millerhill\r\nand in the suburbs of Edinburgh; brick and tile works at Portobello,\r\nMillerhill, Newbattle, Bonnyrigg and Rosewell; and candle works at\r\nDalkeith and Loanhead. Leather also is tanned at Edinburgh and Dalkeith.\r\nThe shipping trade is concentrated at Leith and Granton, and Newhaven is\r\nstill an important fishery centre, while there are also fleets at\r\nFisherrow and Granton.\r\n\r\n_Population and Government._--The population in 1891 was 434,276, and in\r\n1901 488,796, of whom 5765 spoke both Gaelic and English, and 75 Gaelic\r\nonly. The chief towns, besides Edinburgh, the capital (pop. in 1901,\r\n316,837), are Bonnyrigg (1924), Dalkeith (6812), Leith (77,439),\r\nLoanhead (3071), Musselburgh (11,711), Newton Grange (2406), Penicuik\r\n(3574), and West Calder (2652). The county forms a single parliamentary\r\nconstituency, exclusive of Edinburgh city and Leith burghs. It has been\r\ndivided by the county council into four county districts (Calder, Gala\r\nWater, Lasswade, Suburban) for the purposes of the Roads and Bridges Act\r\n1878, and the Public Health Acts. The management of special districts\r\nformed for water supply, drainage and other sanitary purposes is\r\nentrusted to sub committees appointed by the respective district\r\ncommittees. The grant under the Local Taxation (Customs and Excise) Act\r\nis administered by the Technical Education Committee appointed by the\r\nCouncil; and, subject to the same authority, the Secondary Education\r\nCommittee provides for the distribution of the grant under the Local\r\nTaxation (Scotland) Act. In respect of education the shire is under\r\nschool-board jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n_History and Antiquities._--Cramond was once a Roman seaport, and\r\nvarious objects of Roman art and workmanship have been discovered in its\r\nvicinity and along the banks of the Almond. On several heights are\r\nremains of early military works--the most important being that on\r\nDalmahoy Hill, Braidwood Castle in the parish of Penicuik, and Castle\r\nGreg on the Harburn estate in Mid Calder parish. Picts' houses are found\r\nat Crichton Mains, at Borthwick Castle, near Middleton House and\r\nelsewhere, the first being especially interesting from the fact that\r\nsome of the stones bear marks of Roman masonry. There are hut-circles\r\nand a fort on Kaimes Hill, near Ratho; a large tumulus, with three\r\nupright stones, at Old Liston; a smaller tumulus at Newbattle; a\r\ncistvaen or stone burial chest at Carlowrie; and standing stones at\r\nLochend, at Comiston (the Caiy stone), and the \"Cat Stane\" near\r\nKirkliston. Temple, on the South Esk, was at one time the chief seat of\r\nthe Knights Templars in Scotland for whom David I. here built a church,\r\nnow in ruins.\r\n\r\nThe history of the county is almost identical with that of the capital.\r\nTraces of Celtic occupation are obvious in such names as Inveresk,\r\nAlmond, Leith, Dalry, Dalmahoy, Dalkeith and others; though most of the\r\nvillages, hamlets and castles received their present designation from\r\nSaxon possessors. The termination _ton_ is very frequent. Following upon\r\nthe withdrawal of the Romans the land was the scene of intertribal\r\nstrife, but it was in a measure subdued by the Saxons and passed under\r\nthe rule of the Northumbrian kings, who held it till 1020, when the\r\nLothians were handed over to the Scottish king, Malcolm II. The people\r\nof the Lothians, however, stipulated that they were to retain their\r\nmanners and customs, and in this way the south-eastern lowlands became\r\nthe centre from which Anglo-Saxon and Norman civilization gradually\r\nspread throughout Scotland, and hence, too, was assured the pre-eminence\r\nof Edinburgh. Within the county lie the battlefields of Roslin, where\r\n(in 1303) the English suffered three reverses in one day; Burghmuir,\r\nwhere the English were defeated by the earl of Moray in 1334; Pinkie\r\nnear Inveresk, where (in 1547) the duke of Somerset inflicted heavy loss\r\nupon the Scots; and Rullion Green, on the eastern slopes of the\r\nPentlands, where (in 1666) the Covenanters were routed by the royal\r\ntroops under General Dalziel.\r\n\r\n  See James Grant, _Old and New Edinburgh_ (London, 1880 et seq.); Miss\r\n  Warrender, _Walks near Edinburgh_ (Edinburgh, 1890); J.C. Oliphant,\r\n  _Rambles round Edinburgh_ (Edinburgh, 1892); J.M. Bell, _Castles of\r\n  the Lothians_ (Edinburgh, 1893); W. Baird, _Annals of Duddingston and\r\n  Portobello_ (Edinburgh, 1898); J.

At the age of twelve he became a train news-boy on\r\nthe railway to Detroit, and managed to gratify his youthful interest in\r\nchemistry by performing experiments while travelling. At fifteen he\r\nbecame a telegraph operator, and was employed in many cities in the\r\nUnited States and Canada, but frequently neglected his duties in order\r\nto carry on studies and experiments in electrical science. Before he was\r\ntwenty-one he had constructed an automatic repeater, by means of which a\r\nmessage could be transferred from one wire to another without the aid of\r\nan operator; and he had also directed his attention to the problem of\r\nduplex telegraphy, of which he later invented a successful system. In\r\n1869 Edison came to New York city, and soon afterwards became connected\r\nwith the Gold & Stock Company. He invented an improved printing\r\ntelegraph for stock quotations, for which he received $40,000. He then\r\nestablished a laboratory and factory in Newark, N.J., for further\r\nexperiments and for the manufacture of his inventions. In 1876 he\r\nremoved to Menlo Park, and later to West Orange, N.J., where he\r\ncontinued his experiments. Since then his name has been prominently\r\nassociated with all kinds of novelties in practical electricity. Among\r\nhis principal inventions are his system of duplex telegraphy, which he\r\nlater developed into quadruplex and sextuplex transmission; his carbon\r\ntelephone transmitter; the microtasimeter, for the detection of small\r\nvariations in temperature; the phonograph, which records and reproduces\r\nall manner of sounds; the cinematograph, which his improvements made\r\npracticable; and his method of preparing carbon filaments for the\r\nincandescent electric lamp. In 1878 Edison was made a chevalier of the\r\nLegion of Honour by the French government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDMONTON, the capital city of the province of Alberta, Canada, which was\r\nconstituted in 1905. Pop. (1901) 2652; (1906) 11,167. It is\r\npicturesquely situated on the north bank of the North Saskatchewan river\r\nin 113 deg. 37' W. and 53 deg. 32' N. It is on a high tableland which\r\nrises 200 ft. above the river, and overlooks the thickly wooded valley\r\nof the North Saskatchewan river--at this point a mile in width, the\r\nriver itself being one-eighth of a mile wide. Directly opposite Edmonton\r\non the south bank of the river stands Strathcona, a town with a\r\npopulation of 2927. The streets of Edmonton are wide and laid out in\r\nrectangular form. Its excellent drainage makes street grading an easy\r\nmatter. In 1896 it was scarcely a village; in 1901 it assumed some\r\nimportance, but three-quarters of the city were built between 1901 and\r\n1906. Its choice as capital in 1905 gave it a great impetus. The\r\nbuildings, largely of brick, give a substantial appearance to the place.\r\nThe public school buildings, high school and Alberta College are\r\nattractive. The church buildings, many in number, include several\r\narchitecturally beautiful. Three well planned and commodious hospital\r\nbuildings represent the benevolent work of the community. The banks and\r\nthe wholesale warehouses are well built, and many beautiful private\r\nresidences are worthy of note. Its growth may be realized from the fact\r\nthat during a part of 1906, $806,015 worth of building permits were\r\ngranted; the customs receipts, $57,994 in 1905, grew to $104,416 in\r\n1906; the mail parcels handled increased from 6800 to 12,079; and the\r\nexpress parcels handled from 1277 to 2347. Edmonton is the depot of the\r\nfur traders for the great region on the north and west. The Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany has great interest in Edmonton, but is vigorously opposed by a\r\nstrong French firm, Revillon Freres of Paris. These two companies have\r\ntheir posts wide spread over the north country. The city, being\r\nincorporated, is governed by a mayor and a board of aldermen. It\r\noperates its own water service, electric light plant, and telephone\r\nsystem. Its schools are managed by an elected public school board.\r\n\r\nEdmonton was begun as a post of the North West Company about the year\r\n1778. Early in the 19th century the Hudson's Bay Company also\r\nestablished a fort at this point. On the union of the two companies\r\nunder the name of the latter, Fort Edmonton sprang into new importance.\r\nIt became a north-western centre, and in its neighbourhood many\r\nemployees of the fur company, both Scottish and French, took up land as\r\nsettlers. As freighters for the Hudson's Bay Company many of these\r\nsettlers made, with their ox or pony carts, the long journey over the\r\nnatural prairie roads to Fort Garry, fording or swimming the streams,\r\ncarrying furs for a thousand miles or more on the eastern trip, and\r\nreturning brought loads of merchandise for the company. Its\r\ninaccessibility made the Edmonton settlement grow very slowly, so that\r\nits great increase in population belongs to the period subsequent to\r\n1896.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDMONTON, an urban district in the Enfield parliamentary division of\r\nMiddlesex, England, suburban to London, 7-1/2 m. N. of London Bridge, on\r\nthe Old North Road, on the west side of the Lea Valley. Pop. (1891)\r\n25,381; (1901) 46,899. There are numerous factories in the valley, and\r\nEdmonton consists largely of the cottages of artisans. The church of All\r\nSaints has been extensively restored, but retains part of the ancient\r\nfabric of Perpendicular and earlier date. It contains brasses of\r\ninterest, and in the churchyard is the memorial of Charles Lamb, who\r\nlived and died (1834) at Edmonton, and his sister. Cowper and Keats were\r\nalso residents, and the Bell Inn is famed through Cowper's poem _John\r\nGilpin_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDMUND, SAINT [EDMUND RICH] (d. 1240), English saint and archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, was born at Abingdon, near Oxford, about 1175. His father\r\nwas a merchant of that town who retired, with his wife's consent, to the\r\nmonastery of Eynsham, leaving in her hands the education of their\r\nfamily. Her name was Mabel; she was a devout woman who lived an ascetic\r\nlife and encouraged her children to do the same. Both her daughters took\r\nthe veil; three of her sons served the church in different capacities.\r\nEdmund, her first-born, began his education in a grammar school at\r\nOxford. Of weak health and a contemplative disposition, he showed, from\r\nhis earliest years, a remarkable taste for learning and religious\r\nexercises. He saw visions while still at school, and at the age of\r\ntwelve took a vow of perpetual chastity in the Virgin's church at\r\nOxford. Later he was sent, with his brother Robert, to study the liberal\r\narts at Paris. His mother's death and family affairs recalled him for a\r\ntime to England; but he afterwards graduated at Paris. For six years he\r\nlectured in the liberal arts, partly in Paris and partly in Oxford; his\r\ncareer as an Oxford teacher commenced before 1205, and is noteworthy for\r\nthe fact that he was the first who lectured there on Aristotle. He then\r\nreturned to Paris for a course of theological studies, and rapidly made\r\nhimself proficient in that branch of learning.\r\n\r\nAfter spending a year in retirement with the Augustinian canons of\r\nMerton (Surrey) he became a theological lecturer in Oxford. In this\r\ncapacity he gained some reputation, and it is related that his audience\r\nwere often moved to tears by his eloquence. He spent the fees which he\r\nreceived in charity, and refused to spend upon himself the revenues\r\nwhich he derived from several benefices. He not infrequently retired\r\nfor solitude to Reading Abbey; it is probable that he would have become\r\na monk if that profession had afforded more scope for his gifts as a\r\npreacher and expositor. As his fame increased he became alarmed by the\r\ntemptations which it threw in his way. He ceased to lecture in Oxford,\r\nand about 1222 accepted, at the invitation of Bishop Richard Poore, the\r\ntreasurership of Salisbury cathedral. Little is known of his life for\r\nthe next ten years. But he attracted the notice of the Roman court, and\r\nwas appointed in 1227 to preach the Crusade in England; he formed a\r\nfriendship with Ella, countess of Salisbury, and her husband, William\r\nLongsword, and he won general admiration by his works of charity and the\r\nausterity of his life.\r\n\r\nIn 1233 he was elected archbishop of Canterbury at the express\r\nsuggestion of Gregory IX., after the monks of Canterbury had in vain\r\nsuggested three other candidates for the pope's approval. Edmund at once\r\nleaped into prominence by the outspoken manner in which he rebuked the\r\nking for following the advice of foreign favourites. In common with the\r\nbaronial opposition he treated Henry III. as responsible for the tragic\r\nfate of Richard Marshal, earl of Pembroke, and threatened the king with\r\nexcommunication. The king bowed before the storm, dismissed the foreign\r\ncounsellors, made peace with Marshal's adherents, and was publicly\r\nreconciled with the barons. But the new ministers were as unpopular as\r\nthe old; nor was the archbishop allowed that political influence which\r\nhe claimed in virtue of his office. It was with the object of\r\nemancipating himself from Edmund's control that the king asked the pope\r\nto send him a legate (1236). On the arrival of Cardinal Otho (1237) the\r\narchbishop found himself thwarted and insulted at every point. The\r\nmarriage between Simon de Montfort and the Princess Eleanor, which\r\nEdmund had pronounced invalid, was ratified at Rome upon appeal. The\r\nking and legate upheld the monks of Canterbury in their opposition to\r\nthe archbishop's authority. On all public occasions the legate took\r\nprecedence of the archbishop. By the advice of his suffragans Edmund\r\nlaid a protest before the king, and excommunicated in general terms all\r\nwho had infringed the liberties of Canterbury. These measures led to no\r\nresult; nor could the pope be moved to reverse the legate's decisions.\r\nEdmund complained that the discipline of the national church was ruined\r\nby this conflict of powers, and began to meditate retiring. He was\r\nconfirmed in this intention by the papal encroachments of the year 1240,\r\nwhen the English clergy were required to pay a subsidy of a fifth for\r\nthe war against Frederick II., and simultaneously three hundred Romans\r\nwere \"provided\" with English benefices in return for their political\r\nservices to the Holy See. Edmund withdrew to Pontigny in the summer of\r\n1240. A little later the state of his health compelled him to seek the\r\ncooler air of Soissy (near Provins). Here he died on the 16th of\r\nNovember 1240.\r\n\r\nHis canonization was at once demanded by his admirers, and only delayed\r\n(till 1247) through the opposition of Henry III. The honour was well\r\ndeserved. He is one of the most saintly and attractive figures in the\r\nhistory of the English church. It was his misfortune to be placed at the\r\nhead of the national hierarchy in a crisis for which he had not been\r\nprepared by practical training or experience. As archbishop he showed no\r\ngreat capacity or force of character; but the purity of his motives and\r\nthe loftiness of his ideals commanded universal respect.\r\n\r\n  See the Life printed by Martene and Durand in the _Thesaurus novus\r\n  anecdotorum_ (1717). Other lives of importance exist in manuscript at\r\n  the British Museum, in the Cambridge University library and in that of\r\n  St John's College, Cambridge. The last-named is printed by W. Wallace\r\n  in the appendix to his _Life of St Edmund_ (1893). An account of the\r\n  manuscript lives and many extracts (translated) will be found in the\r\n  Rev. B. Ward's _St Edmund_ (1903). See also _St Edmund of Abingdon_\r\n  (1898), by the Baroness Paravicini; and the _English Historical\r\n  Review_, xxii. pp. 84 ff.     (H. W. C. D.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDMUND, king of East Anglia (c. 840-870), succeeded to the East Anglian\r\nthrone in 855 while he was yet but a boy. According to Abbo, followed by\r\nFlorence of Worcester, he was \"_ex antiquorum Saxonum prosapia_,\" which\r\nwould seem to mean that he was of foreign origin and that he belonged to\r\nthe Old Saxons of the continent. This very doubtful tradition was\r\nexpanded later into a fuller legend which spoke of his Old Saxon\r\nparentage, his birth at Nuremberg, his nomination as successor to Offa,\r\nking of East Anglia, and his landing at Hunstanton to claim his kingdom.\r\nHis coronation took place in the next year at \"Burna\" (i.e. probably\r\nBures St Mary, Suffolk), which was then the royal capital.\r\n\r\nOf the life of St Edmund during the next fourteen years we know nothing.\r\nIn the year 870 the Danes, who had been wintering at York, marched\r\nthrough Mercia into East Anglia and took up their quarters at Thetford.\r\nEdward engaged them fiercely in battle, but the Danes under their\r\nleaders Ubba and Inguar were victorious and remained in possession of\r\nthe field of battle. The king himself was slain, whether on the actual\r\nfield of battle or in later martyrdom is not certain, but the widely\r\ncurrent version of the story which makes him fall a martyr to the Danish\r\narrows when he had refused to renounce his faith or hold his kingdom as\r\na vassal from the heathen overlords, may very probably be true. The\r\nstory is a very old one, and according to Abbo of Fleury (945-1004), St\r\nEdmund's earliest biographer, it was told him by Dunstan, who heard it\r\nfrom the lips of Edmund's own standard-bearer. This is chronologically\r\njust possible, but that is all. The battle was fought at Hoxne, some 20\r\nm. south-east of Thetford, and the king's body was ultimately interred\r\nat Beadoricesworth, the modern Bury St Edmunds. The shrine of Edmund\r\nsoon became one of the most famous in England and the reputation of the\r\nsaint was European. The date of his canonization is unknown, but\r\nchurches dedicated to his memory are found all over England.\r\n\r\n  See _Asser's Life of Alfred_, ed. W.H. Stevenson; _Annals of St\r\n  Neots_; _Saxon Chronicle_; _Memorials of St Edmund's Abbey_ (Rolls\r\n  Series), including the _Passio Sancti Edmundi_ of Abbo of Fleury; and\r\n  the _Corolla Sancti Eadmundi_, edited by Lord Francis Hervey (1907).\r\n       (A. Mw.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDMUND I., king of the English (d. 946), was the son of Eadgifu, third\r\nwife of Edward the Elder, and half-brother to his predecessor Aethelstan.\r\nHe succeeded to the throne in 940, but had already played an active part\r\nin the previous reign, especially when he fought by the side of his\r\nhalf-brother in the great battle of Brunanburh.\r\n\r\nIn the first year of his reign Edmund had trouble with Olaf or Anlaf\r\nSihtricsson, called Cuaran. The latter had just crossed from Ireland and\r\nhad been chosen king by the Northumbrians, who threw off their\r\nallegiance to Edmund. Anlaf took York, besieged Northampton and\r\ndestroyed Tamworth, but was met by Edmund at Leicester. The enemy\r\nescaped, but a peaceful settlement was made by the good offices of Odo\r\nof Canterbury and Wulfstan of York. Simeon of Durham states that a\r\ndivision of the kingdom was now made, whereby Edmund took England south\r\nof Watling Street and Anlaf the rest. This division seems incredible,\r\nespecially in face of the poem inserted in the chronicle (_sub anno_\r\n942). There can be little doubt that the story told there of the\r\nreconquest of Northern Mercia by Edmund refers to the compact with\r\nAnlaf, made as a result of the campaign, and it is probable that\r\nSimeon's statement is a wide exaggeration, due in part at least to a\r\nconfused reminiscence of the earlier pact between Alfred and Guthrum.\r\nAll Mercia south of a line from Dore (near Sheffield), through Whitwell\r\nto the Humber, was now in Edmund's hands, and the five Danish boroughs,\r\nwhich had for some time been exposed to raids from the Norwegian kings\r\nof Northumbria, were now freed from that fear. The peace was confirmed\r\nby the baptism of Kings Anlaf and Raegenald, Edmund standing as sponsor,\r\nbut in 944 or 945 the peace was broken and Edmund expelled Anlaf and\r\nRaegenald from Northumbria.\r\n\r\nIn 945 Edmund ravaged Strathclyde, and entrusted it all to Malcolm, king\r\nof Scotland, \"on condition that he should be his fellow-worker by sea\r\nand land,\" the object of this policy being apparently to detach the king\r\nof Scots from any possible confederacy such as had been formed in 937.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of May 946 Edmund's brief but energetic reign came to a\r\ntragic conclusion when he was stabbed at the royal villa of\r\nPucklechurch, in Gloucestershire, by an exiled robber named Liofa, who\r\nhad returned to the court unbidden. Edmund, the \"deed-doer\" as the\r\nchronicle calls him, \"Edmundus magnificus\" as Florence of Worcester\r\ndescribes him, perhaps translating the Saxon epithet, was buried at\r\nGlastonbury, an abbey which he had entrusted in 943 to the famous\r\nDunstan.\r\n\r\nEdmund was twice married; first to Aelfgifu, the mother of Eadwig and\r\nEdgar; second to Aethelflaed \"aet Damerhame\" (i.e. of Damerham, Co. Wilts).\r\nAelfgifu died in 944, according to Ethelwerd.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--_Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_ (ed. Earle and Plummer, Oxford);\r\n  _Simeon of Durham_ (Rolls Series); _A.S. Laws_, ed.

Mw.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDMUND, or EADMUND (c. 980-1016), called IRONSIDE, king of the English,\r\nwas the son of Aethelred II. by his first wife Aelfgifu. When Canute\r\ninvaded England in 1015, Edmund sought to resist him, but, paralysed by\r\nthe treachery and desertion of the ealdorman Edric, he could do nothing,\r\nand Wessex submitted to the Danish king. Next year Canute and Edric\r\ntogether harried Mercia, while Edmund with infinite difficulty gathered\r\nan army. Returning into Northumbria, he in his turn harried the\r\ndistricts which had submitted to the invader, but a march northward by\r\nCanute brought about the speedy submission of Northumbria and the return\r\nof Edmund to London. The death of Aethelred on the 23rd of April 1016 was\r\nfollowed by a double election to the English crown. The citizens of\r\nLondon and those members of the Witan who were present in the city chose\r\nEdmund, the rest of the Witan meeting at Southampton elected Canute. In\r\nthe warfare which ensued Edmund fought at the severest disadvantage, for\r\nhis armies dispersed after every engagement, whatever its issue. Canute\r\nat once fiercely besieged London, but the citizens successfully resisted\r\nall attacks. Edmund meanwhile marched through Wessex and received its\r\nsubmission. At Pen in Somersetshire he engaged the Danes and defeated\r\nthem. Canute now raised the siege of London and soon afterwards\r\nencountered Edmund at Sherston in Wiltshire. The battle was indecisive,\r\nbut Canute marched back to London and left Edmund in possession of\r\nWessex. Edmund hastened after him and relieved London, which he had\r\nagain besieged. He defeated the Danes at Brentford and again at Otford,\r\nand drove them into Sheppey. He was now joined by Edric, in conjunction\r\nwith whom he followed the Danes into Essex, overtaking them at Assandun\r\n(or Ashington). In the battle which ensued Edric again played the\r\ntraitor, and the English were routed with terrible slaughter. Edmund\r\nretired into Gloucestershire, whither he was followed by Canute. He\r\nhimself was anxious to continue the struggle, but Edric and the Witan\r\npersuaded him to accept a reconciliation. At Olney the two rivals swore\r\nfriendship, and a division of the kingdom was effected--Canute taking\r\nthe north, Edmund the south. Soon afterwards Edmund died (30th of\r\nNovember 1016), probably from natural causes, though later historians\r\nhint at foul play.     (C. S. P.*)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDMUND, king of Sicily and earl of Lancaster (1245-1296), was the second\r\nson of Henry III. of England by Eleanor of Provence. At ten years of age\r\nEdmund was invested by Pope Alexander IV. with the kingdom of Sicily\r\n(April 1255); the pecuniary obligations which Henry III. undertook on\r\nhis son's behalf were not the least among the causes which led to the\r\nProvisions of Oxford and the Barons' War. Alexander annulled his grant\r\nin 1258, but still pressed Henry for the discharge of unpaid arrears of\r\nsubsidies. In 1265, after Montfort's fall, Edmund received the earldom\r\nof Leicester, and two years later was created earl of Lancaster. He\r\njoined the crusade of his elder brother, the Lord Edward (1271-1272);\r\nand Edward, on his accession, found in Edmund a loyal supporter. In\r\n1275, two years after the death of his first wife, Aveline de Fortibus,\r\nEdmund married Blanche of Artois, the widow of Henry III. of Navarre and\r\nChampagne. Although the county of Champagne had descended to his wife's\r\ninfant daughter, Joan, Edmund assumed the title \"Count Palatine of\r\nChampagne and Brie,\" and is described in the English patent rolls as\r\nearl of Lancaster and Champagne. Until 1284 he held, in his wife's\r\nright, the custody of Champagne. This he was compelled to renounce upon\r\nthe marriage of Joan to Philip the Fair, the heir to the crown of\r\nFrance. But he retained the possession of his wife's dowerlands in\r\nChampagne, and is described in an official document of Champagne so late\r\nas the year 1287, as \"the Count Edmund.\" He was employed by his brother\r\nas a mediator with Philip the Fair in 1293-1294. When Philip's court\r\npronounced that the king of England had forfeited Gascony, Edmund\r\nrenounced his homage to Philip and withdrew with his wife to England. He\r\nwas appointed lieutenant of Gascony in 1296, but died in the same year,\r\nleaving a son Thomas to succeed him in his English possessions.\r\n\r\n  See \"Edmund, Earl of Lancaster,\" by W.E. Rhodes, in the _English\r\n  Historical Review_, vol. x. pp. 19, 209.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDMUNDS, GEORGE FRANKLIN (1828-), American lawyer and political leader,\r\nwas born in Richmond, Vermont, on the 1st of February 1828. He began the\r\npractice of law in 1849. He was a member of the Vermont House of\r\nRepresentatives in 1854, 1855, 1857, 1858 and 1859, acting for the last\r\ntwo years as speaker, and was a member and president _pro tem._ of the\r\nstate Senate in 1861-1862. In 1866 he became a member, as a Republican,\r\nof the United States Senate, where he remained until 1891, when he\r\nresigned in order to have more time for the practice of his profession.\r\nHe took an active part in the attempt to impeach President Johnson. He\r\nwas influential in providing for the electoral commission to decide the\r\ndisputed presidential election of 1876, and became one of the\r\ncommissioners. In the national Republican nominating conventions of 1880\r\nand 1884 he was a candidate for the presidential nomination. From 1882\r\nto 1885 he was president _pro tem._ of the Senate. As senator he was\r\nconspicuous on account of his legal and parliamentary attainments, his\r\nindustry and his liberal opinions. He was the author of the so-called\r\nEdmunds Act (22nd of March 1882) for the suppression of polygamy in\r\nUtah, and of the anti-trust law of 1890, popularly known as the Sherman\r\nAct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDOM, the district situated to the south of Palestine, between the Dead\r\nSea and the Gulf of 'Akaba (Aelanitic Gulf), the inhabitants of which\r\nwere regarded by the Israelites as a \"brother\" people (see ESAU). On the\r\nE. it touched Moab, the tribes of the great desert and the northern part\r\nof Arabia; on the W. its boundaries were determined by the Sinaitic\r\npeninsula, Egypt and Israel. Both Kadesh and Mt. Hor (perhaps Jebel\r\nMadera) are represented as lying on its border (Num. xx. 16, 22), and\r\nthe modern Wadi el-Fikreh, in which the \"Scorpion pass\" was probably\r\nsituated (Judg. i. 36; Num. xxxiv. 4), may have marked its limits from\r\nJebel Madera north-west towards the southern extremity of the Dead Sea.\r\nKadesh (_'Ain Kadis_), however, lies about 50 m. south of Beersheba (the\r\nsouthern end of Israel as opposed to Dan in the north), and the precise\r\nborders must always have been determined by political conditions: by the\r\nrelations between Edom and its neighbours, Judah, the Philistine states,\r\nMoab, and the restless desert tribes with which Edom was always very\r\nclosely allied.\r\n\r\n  The northern part of Edom became known by a separate name as Gebalene\r\n  (Gebal in Ps. lxxxiii. 7), the modern Jibal, \"mountain country.\" Seir\r\n  or Mt. Seir, a synonym for Edom, not to be confused with the Judaean\r\n  locality (Josh. xv. 10), has been identified with the modern\r\n  _es-sarah_, the hilly region to the south of Petra; though its use\r\n  probably varied in ancient times as much as that of Edom certainly\r\n  did. Mt. Halak, apparently one of its offshoots (Josh. xi. 17, xii.\r\n  7), is of uncertain identification, nor can the exact position of\r\n  Paran (probably desert of _et-Tih_) or Zin (Sin) be precisely\r\n  determined. The chief Edomite cities extended from north to south on\r\n  or adjoining an important trade-route (see below); they include Bozrah\r\n  (Buseire), Shobek, Petra (the capital), and Ma'an; farther to the\r\n  south lay the important seaports Ezion-Geber (mod. 'Ain el-Ghudyan,\r\n  now 15 m. north of the head of the Aelanitic Gulf) and Elath (whence\r\n  the gulf derives its name). Petra (q.v.) is usually identified with\r\n  the biblical Sela, unless this latter is to be placed at the south end\r\n  of the Dead Sea (Judg. i. 36). The sites of Teman and Dedan, which\r\n  also were closely associated with Edom (Jer. xlix. 7 seq.; Ez. xxv.\r\n  13), are uncertain. No doubt, as a general rule, the relations between\r\n  Edomites and the \"sons of the east\" (Ezek. xxv. 10; Job i. 3) and the\r\n  \"kingdoms of Hazor\" (nomad states; Jer. xlix. 28, 30, 33) varied\r\n  considerably throughout the period of O.T. history.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe land of Edom is unfruitful and forbidding, with the notable\r\nexception of fertile districts immediately south of the Dead Sea and\r\nalong its eastern border. It was traversed by an important trade-route\r\nfrom Elath (the junction for routes to Egypt and Arabia) which ran\r\nnorthwards by Ma'an and Moab; but cross-routes turned from Ma'an and\r\nPetra to Gaza or up the Ghor (south end of Dead Sea) to Hebron and\r\nJerusalem.[1] Thus Edom formed a prominent centre for traffic from\r\nArabia and its seats of culture to Egypt, the Philistine towns,\r\nPalestine and the Syrian states, and it enjoyed a commercial importance\r\nwhich made it a significant factor in Palestinian history.\r\n\r\nThe earliest history of Edom is that of the \"sand-dwellers,\" \"archers\"\r\nor _Shasu_ (perhaps \"marauders\"), whose conflicts with ancient Egypt are\r\nnot infrequently mentioned. The first clear reference is in the eighth\r\nyear of Mineptah II. (close of 13th century B.C.), when a tribe of Shasu\r\nfrom Aduma received permission to enter Egypt and feed their flocks.[2]\r\nA little more than a century later Rameses III. claims to have\r\noverthrown the Saaru among the tribes of the Shasu, and the\r\nidentification of this name with Seir is usually recognized, although it\r\nis naturally uncertain whether the Edomites of Old Testament tradition\r\nare meant. According to the latter, the Edomites were a new race who\r\ndrove out the Horites from Mt. Seir. The designation suggests that these\r\nwere \"cave-dwellers,\" but although many caves and hollows have been\r\nfound about Petra (and also in Palestine), this tradition probably\r\n\"serves only to express the idea entertained by later generations\r\nconcerning their predecessors\" (Noldeke).\r\n\r\nNot only is Edom as a nation recognized as older than Israel, but a list\r\nof eight kings, who reigned before the Israelite monarchy, is preserved\r\nin Gen. xxxvi.\r\n\r\n  The first Bela, son of Beor, is often identified with Balaam, but the\r\n  traditions of the Exodus are not precise enough to warrant the\r\n  assumption that the seer was the king of a hostile land in Num. xx. 14\r\n  sqq., which in Deut. ii. 1-8 appears to have been peaceful; see\r\n  BALAAM; EXODUS. In Husham, the third king, several scholars (Gratz,\r\n  Klostermann, Marquart, &c.) have recognized the true adversary of\r\n  Othniel (q.v.; Judg. iii.). The defeat of Midian in the land of Moab\r\n  by his successor Hadad has been associated with the Midianite invasion\r\n  in the time of Gideon (q.v.; Judg. vi. sqq.). The sixth is Shaul,\r\n  whose name happens to be identical with Saul, king of Israel, whilst\r\n  the last Hadad (so 1 Chron. i. 50) of Pau (or Peor in Moab, so the\r\n  Septuagint) should belong to the time of David. The list, whatever its\r\n  value, together with the other evidence in Gen. xxxvi., implies that\r\n  the Edomites consisted of a number of local groups with chieftains,\r\n  with a monarchy which, however, was not hereditary but due to the\r\n  supremacy of stronger leaders. The tradition thus finds an analogy in\r\n  the Israelite \"judges\" before the time of Saul and David.\r\n\r\nSaul, the first king of Israel, conquered Edom (1 Sam. xiv. 47).[3] Of\r\nthe conquest of Edom by David, the first king of the united Judah and\r\nIsrael, several details are given (2 Sam. viii. 13 seq.; 1 Kings xi. 14\r\nsqq.; 1 Chron. xviii. 11 seq.; cf. Ps. lx. title and ver. 8 seq.),\r\nalthough the account of the slaughter is certainly exaggerated. The\r\nscene was the valley of Salt, probably to the south of the Dead Sea. Of\r\nthe escape of the Edomite prince Hadad, and of his residence in Egypt, a\r\ntwofold account is preserved.[4] After the death of David he returned\r\nto Edom; if, as the narrative implies, he became a troublesome adversary\r\nto Solomon, nothing is known of his achievements, and if the royal\r\ntrading-journeys from Ezion-geber were maintained, Edom could have done\r\nlittle. However, in the first half of the 9th century Edom was under the\r\nrule of Jehoshaphat of Judah, and this king together with Israel held\r\nEzion-geber (1 Kings xxii. 47 sqq.; 2 Chron. xx. 35 sqq.). But some\r\ncatastrophe befell the fleet, and shortly afterwards Jehoshaphat's son\r\nJehoram had to face a revolt in which Edom and the men of Libnah (the\r\nPhilistines) were concerned. It was about this period that Israel had\r\nconquered Moab, thrusting it farther south towards Edom, and the\r\nsubsequent success of Moab in throwing off the yoke, and the\r\nunsuccessful attempt of Jehoram of Israel to regain the position, may\r\nshow that Edom was also in alliance with Moab.[5] In the time of\r\nAdad-nirari of Assyria (812-783 B.C.) Edom is mentioned as an\r\nindependent tributary with Beth-Omri (Israel) and Palashtu (Philistia);\r\nthe absence of Judah is perplexing. Amaziah of Judah had gained a signal\r\nvictory over Edom in the valley of Salt (2 Kings xiv. 7), but after his\r\ndefeat by Jehoash of Israel there is a gap and the situation is obscure.\r\nConsequently it is uncertain whether Edom was the vassal of the next\r\ngreat Israelite king Jeroboam II., or whether the Assyrian evidence for\r\nits independent position belongs to this later time. However, Uzziah, a\r\ncontemporary of Jeroboam II., and one of the most successful of Judaean\r\nkings, overcame Edom and its natural allies (2 Chron. xxvi. 6 sqq.), and\r\nat this stage Edomite history becomes more prominent. It joined the\r\ngreat coalition in which Philistia and Israel were leagued against\r\nAssyria, and drove out the Judaeans who had been in possession of\r\nElath.[6] On the events that followed see AHAZ; HEZEKIAH; PHILISTINES.\r\nThe Assyrian inscriptions name as tributary kings of Edom, Kaus-melek\r\n(time of Tiglath-Pileser IV.), Malik (?)-ram (701 B.C.), and Kaus-gabri\r\n(7th century). In the middle of the 7th century both Edom and Moab\r\nsuffered from the restlessness of the desert tribes, and after another\r\nperiod of obscurity, they joined in the attempt made by Zedekiah of\r\nJudah to revolt against Nebuchadrezzar (Jer. xxvii. 3). In the last\r\nyears before the fall of Jerusalem many of the Jews found a refuge in\r\nEdom (Jer. xl. 11), although other traditions throw another light upon\r\nthe attitude of Edom during these disasters.\r\n\r\n  That Edomites burned the temple after the destruction of Jerusalem (1\r\n  Esd. iv. 45, cf. v. 50) is on a line with the repeated denunciation of\r\n  their \"unbrotherly\" conduct in later writings. Certainly the weak\r\n  state of Palestine invited attacks from the outlying tribes, but the\r\n  tone of certain late writings implies a preliminary period of, at\r\n  least, neutrality (cf. Deut. ii. 4 sqq., xxiii. 7 seq.; the omission\r\n  of Edom in xxiii. 3; Neh. xiii. 1; and in Ezra ix. 1--contrast 1 Esd.\r\n  viii. 69). Subsequently Edom is execrated for revengeful attacks upon\r\n  the Jews, and its speedy destruction is foretold; but the passages\r\n  appear to be much later than the disaster of 587 B.C., and may even\r\n  imply conditions after the restoration (Ob. 10 sqq.; Ezek. xxv. 12-14;\r\n  Jer. xlix. 7; Ps. cxxxvii. 7; Lam. iv. 21 seq., v. 2 sqq.). But at\r\n  length the day of reckoning came (cf. Is. xxxiv. 5; lxiii. 1-6), and\r\n  the fate of Edom is still fresh in the mind of Malachi (i. 1-5).\r\n\r\nThe problem is complicated by the possibility that during the ages over\r\nwhich the references can range many changes of fortune could have\r\noccurred. The pressure of the Nabataeans (q.v.) forced Edom to leave its\r\nformer seats and advance into the south of Judah with Hebron as the\r\ncapital. This had been fully accomplished by 312 B.C., but the date of\r\nthe first occupation cannot be ascertained from the literary evidence\r\nalone. Thus the district in question is Jewish in the time of Nehemiah\r\n(Neh. xi. 25-30), but it is uncertain whether the Edomite occupation was\r\nearlier (a fusion being assumed) or later, or whether the passage may be\r\nuntrustworthy. Henceforth, the new home of the Edomites is consequently\r\nknown as Idumaea. See, for further history, HEROD; JEWS.[7]\r\n\r\nAlthough but little is known of the inhabitants of Edom, their close\r\nrelationship to Judah and their kinship with the surrounding tribes\r\ninvest them with particular interest. The ties which united Lot (the\r\n\"father\" of Ammon and Moab), Ishmael, Midian and Edom (Esau) with the\r\nsouthern tribes Judah and Simeon, as manifested in the genealogical\r\nlists, are intelligible enough on geographical grounds alone, and the\r\nsignificance of this for the history of Judah and Palestine cannot be\r\nignored. The traditions recording the separation of Lot from Abraham, of\r\nHagar and Ishmael from Isaac, and of Esau from Jacob, although at\r\npresent arranged in a descending scheme of family relationship, are the\r\nresult of systematic grouping and cannot express any chronological order\r\nof events (see GENESIS). Many motives have worked to bring these legends\r\ninto their present form, and while they depict the character of Israel's\r\nwilder neighbours, they represent the recurrent alternating periods of\r\nhostility and fellowship between it and Edom which mark the history.\r\nEsau (Edom) although the older, loses his superiority, and if the\r\noracles declare that the elder shall serve the younger (Jacob, i.e.\r\nIsrael), the final independence of Esau (Gen. xxv. 23, xxvii. 39 seq.),\r\nas foretold, obviously alludes to some successful Edomite revolt. As an\r\nenemy, Edom in alliance with the tribes along the trade-routes\r\n(Philistines, Moabites, &c.) was responsible for many injuries, and in\r\nfrequent forays carried away Judaeans as slaves for Gaza and Tyre (Am.\r\ni. 6 seq., 9). As an ally or vassal, it was in touch with the wealth of\r\nArabia (Ezek. xxvii. 16, read \"Edom\" for \"Aram\"), and Judah and Israel\r\nas well as Gaza and Damascus enjoyed the fruits of its commerce. In view\r\nof the evidence for the advanced culture of early Arabia, the question\r\nof Edom is extremely suggestive, and although speculation at this stage\r\nwould be premature, it is interesting to observe that Edomite and allied\r\ntribes were famed for their wisdom,[8] and that apart from the\r\n_possibility_ of Arabian influence upon Israelite culture, the influence\r\nof Midian and related tribes is _certain_ from the traditions of Moses\r\nand of his work (see JETHRO; KENITES; MOSES), and the Edomite district\r\nwas a traditional home of Yahweh himself (Deut. xxxiii. 2; Judg. v. 4;\r\nHab. iii. 3); see HEBREW RELIGION. It should be added, however, that the\r\nEdomite names and other evidence point to the cult of other gods, viz.\r\nBaal, Hadad, Malik (cf. MOLOCH), Kaus, or Kus, and Kozeh (Jos. _Ant._\r\nxv. 7, 9), who was probably a sky or lightning deity.\r\n\r\n  The names Esau and Edom are possibly old divine names; see ESAU and\r\n  _Ency. Bib._ s.v. \"Obed edom\" (the name appears to mean \"servant of\r\n  Edom\"). For Kaus, see Baethgen, _Beitr. z. semit.\r\n  Religionsgeschichte_, p. 11 seq.; G.A. Cooke, _N. Sem. Inscr._ p. 234;\r\n  _Ency. Bib._ col. 2682, n. 2 and 2688 (s.v. \"Kushaiah\"); and Zimmern,\r\n  _Keilinschr. u. d. alte Test._^3, pp. 472 seq. On the question of\r\n  early Arabian civilization see YEMEN. That the name Mizraim (Misraim),\r\n  \"Egypt,\" was extended eastwards of the Delta is in itself probable,\r\n  but it is still uncertain whether the term (also Ass. Musri) was\r\n  applied to Edom. The evidence (which is of mixed value) makes the view\r\n  a plausible one, but the theory has often been exaggerated (see\r\n  MIZRAIM). For Edom see, generally, Buhl, _Gesch. d. Edomiter_ (1893);\r\n  Noldeke's article in _Ency. Bib._; W. Libbey and F.E. Hoskins, _The\r\n  Jordan Valley and Petra_ (1905); the conjectural sketch by I. Levy in\r\n  _Rev. d'etudes juives_ (Jan. 1906). For the history and culture of the\r\n  latest period, see J.P. Peters and Thiersch, _Painted Tombs in the\r\n  Necropolis of Marissa_ (1905), ch. i.     (S. A. C.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] See further, E.

Gardiner,\r\n    _Sitz.-Ber._ of the Berlin Academy, 1907, pp. 142 sqq. The suggestion\r\n    that the city Udumu, in the land of Gar, mentioned in the 15th\r\n    century (_Amarna Tablets_, ed. Winckler, No. 237), is Edom, Gar being\r\n    the Eg. _Kharu_ (Palestine) and the O.T. Horites (see above), is\r\n    extremely hazardous. That the name Aduma (above) refers to Etham (so\r\n    Naville, &c.) is improbable.\r\n\r\n  [3] That the Edomites preserved this tradition of Saul's sovereignty\r\n    and (from their standpoint) enrolled him among their kings (Gen.\r\n    xxxvi. 37) cannot of course be proved. The account of the ferocious\r\n    slaughter of the priests of Nob at Saul's command by Doeg the Edomite\r\n    is a secondary tradition and probably of late origin (1 Sam. xxi.\r\n    1-9, xxii. 6-23); cf. the hostility of Edom in exilic and post-exilic\r\n    times (p. 878, col. 1).\r\n\r\n  [4] 1 Kings l.c., see the Septuagint and, especially, H.

He succeeded his brother Edmund\r\nin the year 946 and at this time received the formal submission both of\r\nthe Northumbrians and Scots. In the next year Edred himself went to\r\nTanshelf, near Pontefract, in Yorkshire, where he received from\r\nWulfstan, archbishop of York, and the Northumbrian \"witan\" confirmation\r\nof their submission. Shortly after they threw their pledges to the winds\r\nand took the Norwegian Eric Bloodaxe, son of Harold Fairhair (Harald\r\nHarfagar), as their king. Edred recklessly ravaged all Northumbria in\r\nrevenge, burning Ripon during his march. On his return home Edred's\r\nrearguard was attacked at Castleford, and the infuriated king once more\r\nturned to ravage Northumbria, which was only saved by its abandonment of\r\nEric and by compensation made to Edred. Archbishop Wulfstan seems to\r\nhave been a centre of disaffection in the north, and in 952 Edred caused\r\nhim to be imprisoned in the castle of \"Judanburh,\" while in the same\r\nyear the king, in revenge for the slaying of Abbot Eadelm, slew many of\r\nthe citizens of Thetford. After the brief rule of Anlaf Cuaran in\r\nNorthumbria, Eric was once more restored, probably in 950, only to be\r\nexpelled again in 953 or 954, when Edred took the Northumbrian kingdom\r\ninto his own hands. In the same year Wulfstan was liberated and\r\nappointed to the Mercian bishopric of Dorchester. Edred died on the 23rd\r\nof November 955 at Frome, in Somersetshire, and was buried in the old\r\nminster at Winchester. During the whole of his life Edred was troubled\r\nby ill-health, a fact which may help to explain some of the more\r\npassionate acts of violence attributed to him. The king was throughout\r\nhis life on terms of personal intimacy with St Dunstan, and his public\r\npolicy was largely guided by that prelate and by his own mother Eadgifu.\r\nSo far as we know, Edred was never married.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--The _Saxon Chronicle_ (ed.

In 1007 he became ealdorman of the\r\nMercians, and subsequently married Aethelred's daughter Eadgyth. In the\r\nstruggle between the English and the Danes he appears in the character\r\nof an arch-traitor. When Aethelred in 1009 proposed a great attack on the\r\nDanes, Edric dissuaded him from carrying it into effect. Again, on the\r\ninvasion of England by Canute in 1015 Edric deserted Edmund Ironside and\r\njoined him. After the battle of Otford he returned to Edmund, but only\r\nby his treachery at the battle of Assandun to secure the utter defeat of\r\nthe national cause. When peace was at length made, Canute restored to\r\nEdric the earldom of Mercia; but at Christmas 1017, fearing further\r\ntreachery, he had him slain--\"very rightly\" says the _Saxon Chronicle_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDUCATION. In the following treatment of this subject, the theory and\r\nearly history of education is first dealt with, and secondly the modern\r\norganization of education as a national concern. Many definitions have\r\nbeen given of the word \"education,\" but underlying them all is the\r\nconception that it denotes an attempt on the part of the adult members\r\nof a human society to shape the development of the coming generation in\r\naccordance with its own ideals of life. It is true that the word has not\r\ninfrequently been used in wider senses than this. For example, J.S. Mill\r\nincluded under it everything which \"helps to shape the human being\";\r\nand, with some poetic licence, we speak of the education of a people or\r\neven of the whole human race. But all such usages are rhetorical\r\nextensions of the commonly accepted sense of the term, which includes,\r\nas an essential element, the idea of deliberate direction and training\r\n(Lat. _educare_, to bring up; _educere_, to draw out, lead forth). No\r\ndoubt, all education is effected through the experiences of the\r\neducated, and much of it is indirect, consisting mainly in the\r\ndetermination of the form of experiences other than those of direct\r\nprecept, compulsion and instruction. But it does not follow that all\r\nexperiences are educative. Whether an experience is part of an\r\nindividual's education or not is determined by its origin. Whatever be\r\nits effect, it is educative in so far as its form has been arranged with\r\ngreater or less deliberation by those who are concerned with the\r\ntraining of him whose experience it is. It follows that an education may\r\nbe good or bad, and that its goodness or badness will be relative to\r\nthe virtue, wisdom and intelligence of the educator. It is good only\r\nwhen it aims at the right kind of product, and when the means it adopts\r\nare well adapted to secure the intended result and are applied\r\nintelligently, consistently and persistently.\r\n\r\nEducation is, thus, a definitely personal work, and will vary between\r\nwide extremes of effectiveness and worth in any given society. For in\r\nall times and places there are wide differences in virtue, wisdom and\r\ncapacity among those who have in their hands the care and nurture of the\r\nyoung. But the inference that, therefore, no comparative estimate of the\r\neducation of different times and places can be made would be fallacious.\r\nFor, despite all differences in conception and efficiency among\r\nindividual educators, each expresses, more or less perfectly and\r\nclearly, the common conception and energy of his age and country. As\r\nthese rise or fall the general level of the actual educative practice\r\nrises or sinks with them. The first essential for successful educative\r\neffort is, then, that the community as a whole should have a true\r\nestimate of the nature and value of education.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. EDUCATIONAL THEORY\r\n\r\nIn any comparative estimate of different places and times, as tested by\r\nthe standard just given, it must be borne in mind that, except in the\r\nmost general and abstract form, we cannot speak of an ideally best\r\neducation. Looking at the individual to be educated, we may say with\r\nPlato that the aim of education is \"to develop in the body and in the\r\nsoul all the beauty and all the perfection of which they are capable,\"\r\nbut this leaves quite undecided the nature and form of that beauty and\r\nperfection, and on such points there has never been universal agreement\r\nat any one time, while successive ages have shown marked differences of\r\nestimate. We get nearer to the point when we reflect that individual\r\nbeauty and perfection are shown, and only shown, in actual life, and\r\nthat such life has to be lived under definite conditions of time, place,\r\nculture, religion, national aspirations and mastery over material\r\nconditions. Perfection of life, then, in the Athens of the age of Plato\r\nwould show a very different form from that which it would take in the\r\nLondon or Paris of to-day. So an individualistic statement of the\r\npurpose of education leads on analysis to considerations that are not,\r\nin themselves, individualistic. The personal life is throughout a\r\nrelation between individual promptings to activity and the environment\r\nin which alone such promptings can, by being actualized, become part of\r\nlife. And the perfection of the life is to be sought in the perfection\r\nof the relations thus established. So far, then, as any conception of\r\neducation can give guidance to the actual process it must be relative in\r\nevery way to the state of development of the society in which it is\r\ngiven. Indeed, looked at in the mass, education may be said to be the\r\nefforts made by the community to impose its culture upon the growing\r\ngeneration. Here again is room for difference. The culture in question\r\nmay be accepted as absolute at least in its essentials, and then the\r\nideal of education will be to secure its stability and perpetuation, or\r\nit may be regarded as a stage in a process of development, and then the\r\nideal will be to facilitate the advance of the next generation beyond\r\nthe point reached by the present. So some ages will show a relatively\r\nfixed conception of the educative process, others will be times of\r\nunrest and change in this as in other modes of social and intellectual\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nIt is in these latter times that the actual work of education is apt to\r\nlose touch with the culture of the community. For schools (q.v.) and\r\nuniversities (q.v.), which are the ordinary channels through which adult\r\nculture reaches the young, are naturally conservative and bound by\r\ntradition. They are slow to leave the old paths which have hitherto led\r\nto the desired goal, and to enter on new and untried ways. If the\r\nopposition to change is absolute, there must come a time when the\r\ninstruments of education are out of true relation to the desired end.\r\nFor change in culture ideals means change in the specific form of the\r\ngoal of education, and consequently the paths of educative effort need\r\nreadjustment. When the goal of the past is no longer the goal of the\r\npresent, to follow the ways which led to the former is to fail to reach\r\nthe latter. Continuous readjustment, by small and almost imperceptible\r\ndegrees, is the ideal at which the educator should aim. When this is not\r\nsecured, the educational domain is liable to sudden and violent\r\nrevolutions which are destructive of successful educative effort at the\r\ntime they occur, however beneficial their results may be in the future.\r\n\r\nBut the relation of adjustment is not entirely one-sided. The tone of\r\nthought and feeling and the direction of will induced by education\r\nnecessarily affect the common ideals of the next generation, and may\r\nmake them better or worse than those of the present. Hence, the educator\r\nmust not blindly accept all current views of life, but rather select the\r\nhighest. For the average thought of every community is obviously below\r\nits best thought; and may, in some points at any rate, be lower than the\r\nbest thought of a past age. While, then, all true education must be in\r\ndirect relation with the culture of its age and country, yet, especially\r\non the ethical side, it should aim at transcending the average thought\r\nand tone.\r\n\r\nStill more does this imply that education strives to transcend the\r\npresent condition of the educated by making their life more rational,\r\nmore volitional, and more attracted by goodness and beauty than it would\r\notherwise be. It can never be a passive watching of the child's\r\ndevelopment. No more fundamental error can be made than the assumption\r\nthat education can be determined wholly, or even mainly, by the\r\ntendencies and impulses with which a child is endowed. Its real guiding\r\nprinciple must be a conception of the nature to which the child may\r\nattain, not a knowledge of that with which it starts. The educator\r\nstudies the original endowment of the child and the early stages in the\r\ndevelopment of that innate nature in order that he may, wisely and\r\nsuccessfully, employ appropriate means to direct further development and\r\nto accelerate its progress towards a more rational, complete and worthy\r\nlife; not that he may the more skilfully give facilities to the child to\r\ndrift about on the unregulated currents of caprice.\r\n\r\nSuch considerations show the importance of an insight into the theory of\r\neducation on the part of all who are practically concerned with its\r\ndirection. But the theory required is no system of abstract ideas\r\nignoring the real concrete conditions of the life for which the actual\r\neducation it is to guide is a preparation. To approach the subject only\r\nfrom the standpoint of the mental sciences which underlie it is to run\r\nthe risk of setting up such a body of abstractions, whose relation to\r\nreal life is neither very close nor very direct. The most profitable way\r\nof developing an educational theory for the present is to trace how in\r\nthe past education has consciously adapted itself, more or less truly\r\nand fully, to the conditions of culture and social life; and by analysis\r\nto discover the reasons for comparative success or failure in the degree\r\nof clearness with which the end to be sought was apprehended and the\r\nnature of the children to be trained was understood.\r\n\r\nIn all ages the claims of the individual and those of the community have\r\nstruggled for the mastery as the ultimate principles of life. As one or\r\nthe other has prevailed the conception of education has emphasized\r\nsocial service or individual success as the primary end. The true\r\nharmony of human life will only be attained when these two impulses,\r\ncontradictory on their own level, are united in a higher synthesis which\r\nsees each as the complement of the other in a life whose purpose is\r\nneither simple egoism nor pure altruism. Until that conception of life\r\nis attained and held generally there can be no sure and universally\r\naccepted conception of the aim and function of education. Much of the\r\ninterest of the history of education[1] turns on the relation of these\r\ntwo principles as determinants of its aim.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Old Greek education.\r\n\r\nIn ancient Greece the supremacy of the state was generally unquestioned,\r\nand, especially in the earlier times, the good man was identified with\r\nthe good citizen. No doubt, in later days philosophers, such as Plato\r\nand Aristotle, saw clearly that the round of the duties of citizenship\r\ndid not exhaust the life of the individual. With them the highest life\r\nwas one of cultured leisure in which the energies were mainly\r\nconcentrated on the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake. But this\r\n\"diagogic\" life was only for the select few; for the undistinguished\r\nmany the fulfilment by each of the duties of his station remained the\r\nmeasure of worthy life, though such duties were regarded as affecting\r\nthe individual and private relations of the citizens in a much more\r\nintimate way than in former and ruder ages. And for those who devoted\r\ntheir lives to the highest culture, the essential preliminary condition\r\nwas the existence of such a state as would form the most favourable\r\nenvironment for their pursuits and the most stable foundation for their\r\nleisured life. Thus Greek thought was saturated with the conception of\r\nlife as essentially a set of relations between the individual and the\r\ncity-state of which he formed an integral part. The first aim of\r\neducation was therefore to train the young as citizens.\r\n\r\nThis training must, of necessity, be of a specific kind; for, like other\r\nsmall communities, the Greek city-states showed a life fundamentally one\r\nin conception, under various specific forms. Each state had its special\r\ncharacter, and to this character the education given in it must conform\r\nif it were to be an effective instrument for training the citizens. From\r\nthese fundamental conceptions flowed the demands of Plato and Aristotle\r\nthat education should be regulated in all its details by the state\r\nauthority, should be compulsory on all free citizens, and should be\r\nuniform--at any rate in its earlier stages--for all. In the _Republic_\r\nand the _Laws_, Plato shows to what extreme lengths theory may go when\r\nit neglects to take account of some of the most pertinent facts of life.\r\nFor the guardian-citizens of the ideal state family life and family ties\r\nare abolished; no lower community is to be allowed to enter into\r\ncompetition with the state. Aristotle, indeed, did not go to these\r\nextreme lengths; he allowed the family to remain, but he seems to have\r\nregarded it as likely to affect children more for evil than for good.\r\n\r\nIn the essential principles laid down by both philosophers as to the\r\nrelation of the state to education, and in the corollaries they drew\r\nfrom that relation, they were not at variance with the accepted Greek\r\ntheory on the subject. It is true that the actual practice of Greek\r\nstates departed, and often widely, from this ideal, for, especially in\r\nlater centuries, the Greek always tended to live his own life. The\r\nnearest approach to the theory was found in Sparta, where the end of the\r\nstate as a military organization was kept steadily in view, and where,\r\nafter early childhood, the young citizens were trained directly by the\r\nstate in a kind of barrack life--the boys to become warriors, the girls\r\nthe mothers of warriors. It was this feature of Spartan education,\r\ntogether with the rude simplicity of life it enforced, which attracted\r\nPlato, and, to a less extent, Aristotle. In Athens there had of old been\r\nstate laws insisting on the attendance of the children of the free\r\ncitizens at school, and, in some degree, regulating the schools\r\nthemselves. But at the time of Plato these had fallen into desuetude,\r\nand the state directly concerned itself only with the training of the\r\nephebi, for which, we learn from Aristotle's _Constitution of Athens_,\r\nsomewhat elaborate provisions were made by the appointment of officers,\r\nand the regulation of both intellectual and physical pursuits. For\r\nchildren and youths under the ephebic age there was no practical\r\nregulation of schools or palaestra by the state. Yet there is no doubt\r\nthat the education really given was in conformity with Athenian ideals\r\nof culture and life, and that it was generally received by the children\r\nof free citizens, though of course the sons of the wealthy, then as now,\r\ncould and did continue their attendance at school to a later age than\r\ntheir poorer brethren. The education of girls was essentially a domestic\r\ntraining. What Plato and Aristotle, with the theorist's love of official\r\nsystematic regulation, regarded as the greatest defect of Athenian\r\neducation was in reality its strongest point. In practice, the harmony\r\nbetween individual liberty and social claims was much more nearly\r\nattained under a system of free working out of common thoughts and\r\nideals than would have been the case under one of the irresistible\r\nimposition from without of a rigid mould.\r\n\r\nThe instruments of education everywhere found to be in harmony with the\r\nGreek conception of life and culture were essentially twofold,--\"music\"\r\n([Greek: mousike]), or literary and artistic culture, for the mind, and\r\nsystematic gymnastic ([Greek: gymnastike]) for the body. Plato, in the\r\n_Republic_, shows that the latter, as well as the former, affects the\r\ncharacter, and doubtless, though not formulated, this was generally more\r\nor less vaguely felt. But Greek gymnastic was really an individual\r\ntraining, and therefore made only indirectly for the aim of cultivating\r\nthe social bonds of citizenship. Ancient Greece had nothing\r\ncorresponding in value in this respect to the organized games which form\r\nso important a feature in the school life of modern England. The\r\n\"musical\" training was essentially in the national literature and music\r\nof Greece, and this could obviously be carried to very different\r\nlengths. The elements of mathematical science were also commonly taught.\r\nThe essential purpose throughout was the development of the character of\r\na loyal citizen of Athens. As Athenian culture advanced, increasing\r\nattention was paid to diagogic studies, especially in the ephebic age,\r\nwith a corresponding decrease of attention to merely physical pursuits;\r\nhence the complaints of such satirists as Aristophanes of a growing\r\nluxury, effeminacy and corruption of youths: complaints apparently based\r\non a comparison of the worst features of the actual present with an\r\nidealized and imaginative picture of the virtues of the past. Such\r\ncomparison is, indeed, implicit in much of Plato and Aristotle as well\r\nas in Aristophanes.\r\n\r\nBut a disintegrating force was already at work in the educational system\r\nof Greece which Plato and Aristotle vainly opposed. This was the\r\nrhetorical training of the Sophists, the narrowly practical and\r\nindividualistic aim of which was entirely out of harmony with the older\r\nGreek ideals of life and culture. In a democratic city-state the orator\r\neasily became a demagogue, and generally oratory was the readiest path\r\nto influence and power. Thus oratory opened the way to personal\r\nambition, and young men who were moved by that passion eagerly attended\r\nthe Sophist schools where their dominant motive was strengthened.\r\n\r\nFurther, the closer relations between the Greek states, both in nearer\r\nand farther Hellas, led naturally to the diminution of differences\r\nbetween civic ideals, and, as a consequence, to a more cosmopolitan\r\nconception of higher education. This process was completed by the loss\r\nof political independence of the city-states under the Macedonian\r\ndomination. Henceforth, higher education became purely intellectual, and\r\nits relation to political and social life increasingly remote. This,\r\ncombined with the growing rhetorical tendency already noticed, accounts\r\nfor the sterility of Greek thought during the succeeding centuries. The\r\nmeans of higher education were, indeed, more fully organized. The\r\nuniversity of Athens was the outcome of a fusion of the private\r\nphilosophical schools with the state organization for the training of\r\nthe ephebi, and there were other such centres of higher culture,\r\nespecially in after years at Alexandria, where the contact of Greek\r\nthought with the religions and philosophies of Egypt and the East gave\r\nbirth in time to the more or less mystical philosophies which culminated\r\nin Neo-platonism. But at Athens itself thought became more and more\r\nsterile, and education more and more a mere training in unreal rhetoric,\r\ntill the dissolution of the university by Justinian in A.D. 529.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Old Roman education.\r\n\r\nThus when Rome conquered Greece, Greek education had lost that reality\r\nwhich is drawn from intimate relation to civic life, and the fashionable\r\nindividualistic schools of philosophy could do nothing to replace the\r\nloss. It was, then, an education which had largely lost its life-springs\r\nthat was transferred to Rome. In the earlier centuries of the republic,\r\nRoman education was given entirely in family and public life. The father\r\nhad unlimited power over his son's life, and was open to public censure\r\nif he failed to train him in the ordinary moral, civic and religious\r\nduties. But it is doubtful if there were any schools (q.v.), and it is\r\ncertain there was no national literature to furnish an instrument of\r\nculture. A Roman boy learnt to reverence the gods, to read, to bear\r\nhimself well in manly exercises, and to know enough of the laws of his\r\ncountry to regulate his conduct. This last he acquired directly by\r\nhearing his father decide the cases of his clients every morning in his\r\nhall. The rules of courtesy he learnt similarly by accompanying his\r\nfather to the social gatherings to which he was invited. Thus early\r\nRoman education was essentially practical, civic and moral, but its\r\nintellectual outlook was extremely narrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Hellenized Roman education.\r\n\r\nWhen a wider culture was imported from Greece it was, however, the form\r\nrather than the spirit of true Hellenic education that was transferred.\r\nThis was, indeed, to some extent inevitable from the decadent state of\r\nGreek education at the time, but it was accentuated by the essentially\r\npractical character of the Roman mind. The instrument of education first\r\nintroduced was Greek literature, much of which was soon translated into\r\nLatin. In time the schools of the _grammatici_, teaching grammar and\r\nliterature, were supplemented by schools of rhetoric and philosophy,\r\nthough the philosophy taught in them was itself little more than\r\nrhetorical declamation. These furnished the means of higher culture for\r\nthose youths who did not study at Alexandria or Athens, and were also\r\npreparatory to studies at those universities. Under the Empire the\r\nrhetorical schools were gradually organized into a state system, the\r\ngeneral principles of administration being laid down by imperial decree,\r\nand even such details as the appointment and rate of payment of the\r\nprofessors, at first left to the municipalities, being in time assumed\r\nby the central government. There is no evidence of any state regulation\r\nor support of the lower schools. This widening of culture affected both\r\nboys and girls, the domestic education of the latter being supplemented\r\nby a study of literature. But it is the higher training in rhetoric\r\nwhich is especially characteristic of Hellenized Roman education.\r\n\r\nThe conception of a rhetorical culture is seen at its best in\r\nQuintilian's _Institutio oratoria_, the most systematic treatise on\r\neducation produced by the ancient world. With Quintilian the ideal of an\r\norator was a widely cultured, wise and honourable man. And at first the\r\nteaching of rhetoric undoubtedly made for higher and true culture. But\r\nwith the autocracy, soon passing into tyranny, of the empire, rhetoric\r\nceased to be a preparation for real life. The true function of oratory\r\nis to persuade a free people. When it cannot be applied to this purpose\r\nit becomes little more than a means of intellectual frivolity, or, at\r\nthe best, an exhibition of cultured ingenuity. Under the empire a\r\nrhetorical training was, indeed, turned in not a few instances to\r\npractical but most unworthy uses by the delators; a result made possible\r\nby the legal system which rewarded delation with a considerable portion\r\nof the estate of the condemned. Even apart from this, the education in\r\nrhetoric had an increasingly evil effect both on the culture and on the\r\ncharacter of the higher classes in the Roman empire. Out of real\r\nconnexion with life as it was, it sought its subjects in the realms of\r\nthe fanciful and the trivial, and with unreality of topic went of\r\nnecessity deterioration of style. The vivid presentment of living\r\nthought gave way to that inflated and bombastic abuse of meretricious\r\nornament and far-fetched metaphor in which human speech is always\r\ninvolved when it sets forth ideas, or shadows of ideas, which grow out\r\nof no conviction in the speaker and are expected to carry no conviction\r\nto the hearer. Imitation of the form of great models, without the\r\nsubstance of thought which underlay them, led to a general unreality and\r\nessential falseness of mental life. Further, the continual gazing with\r\nadmiration on the productions of the past, and the conception of\r\nexcellence as consisting in closeness of imitation, induced a servile\r\nattitude of mind towards authority in all too close agreement with the\r\npolitical servility which marked the Roman court. Such an attitude was\r\nessentially hostile to mental initiative, and thus rhetoric became not\r\nmerely an art of expression but a type of character.\r\n\r\nNor was there anything in the general conditions of society to\r\ncounterbalance the ill effects of school and university education.\r\nQuintilian lamented that, even in his time, the old Roman family\r\neducation by example was corrupted; and the moral degradation of later\r\ntimes, though it has doubtless been exaggerated, was certainly real and\r\nwidespread. Nor does the religious revival of Paganism which\r\nsynchronized with the early centuries of Christianity appear to have\r\neffected any reform in life. Alexandria, the birthplace of Neo-platonism\r\nand the intellectual centre of the later empire, was also a very sink of\r\nmoral obliquity.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Christianity and Pagan education.\r\n\r\nIt was into such a decaying civilization, which by its want of vitality\r\nsterilized education, oppressing it under the weight of a dead\r\ntradition, that Christianity brought new life. Of course, careful\r\ninstruction in the Faith was given in catechetical schools, of which\r\nthat at Alexandria was the most famous. But the question as to the\r\nattitude of Christians towards the ordinary classical culture was\r\nimportant. On the one hand, literature was saturated with Paganism, and\r\nthe Pagan festivals formed a regular part of school life. On the other\r\nhand, the Pagan education offered the only means of higher culture, and\r\nthus furnished the only weapon with which Christians could successfully\r\nmeet their controversial antagonists. Quite at first, no doubt, when the\r\nconverts to the new faith were few and obscure, the question scarcely\r\narose; but as men of culture and position were attracted to the Church\r\nit became urgent. The answers given by the Christian leaders were\r\nvarious, and largely the outcome of temperament and previous training.\r\nThe Greek Fathers, especially Clement of Alexandria (150-217) and Origen\r\n(185-253), regarded Christianity as essentially the culmination of\r\nphilosophy, to which the way must be found through liberal culture.\r\nWithout a liberal education the Christian could live a life of faith and\r\nobedience but could not attain an intellectual understanding of the\r\nmysteries of the Faith. On the other hand, Tertullian (160-240) was very\r\nsuspicious of Pagan culture; though he granted the necessity of\r\nemploying it as a means of education, yet he did so with regret, and\r\nwould forbid Christians to teach it in the public schools, where some\r\nrecognition of Paganism would be implied. The general practice of the\r\nChristians, however, did not conform to Tertullian's exhortations.\r\nIndeed, many of the cultivated Christians of the 3rd and 4th centuries\r\nwere little more than nominal adherents to the Faith, and the\r\nintercourse between Christian and Pagan was often close and friendly.\r\nThe general attitude of Christians towards the traditional education is\r\nevidenced by the protest raised against the edict of Julian, which\r\nforbade them to teach in the public schools. The ultimate outcome seems\r\nto be fairly expressed in the writings of St Augustine (354-430) and St\r\nJerome (346-420), who held that literary and rhetorical culture is good\r\nso long as it is kept subservient to the Christian life.\r\n\r\nIn another way Greek philosophy exercised an abiding influence over the\r\nculture of future ages. The early centuries of Christianity felt the\r\nneed of formulating the Faith to preserve it from disintegration into a\r\nmass of fluid opinions, and such formulation was of necessity made under\r\nthe influence of the philosophy in which the early Fathers had been\r\ntrained--that Neo-platonism which was the last effort of Paganism to\r\nattain a conception of life and of God. In the West, this formulation\r\nhad to be translated into Latin, for Greek was no longer generally\r\nunderstood in Italy, and thus the juristic trend of Roman thought also\r\nbecame a factor in the exposition of Christian doctrine. This\r\nformulation of the Faith was one of the chief legacies the transition\r\ncenturies passed on to the middle ages.\r\n\r\nHad classical culture been less formal than it was during the early\r\ncenturies of Christianity, the innate antagonism of the Pagan and\r\nChristian views of life and character must have been so apparent that\r\nthe education which prepared for the one could not have been accepted by\r\nthe other. It was only because rhetorical culture was so emphatically\r\nintellectual, and so little, if at all, moral in its aims, that its\r\ninherent opposition to the Christian conception of character was not\r\nobvious. That its antagonistic influence was not inoperative is shown by\r\nthe not infrequent perversions of cultured Christians to Paganism. But\r\ngenerally the opposition was so obscured that the ethical writings of St\r\nAmbrose (340-397) are largely Stoic in conception and reasoning. Yet the\r\nPagan ideal of life, especially as it had been developed in the\r\nindividualistic ethics which had prevailed for more than six centuries,\r\nwas antithetical in essence to that of the Christian Church. The former\r\nwas essentially an ethics of self-reliance and self-control showing\r\nitself in moderation and proportion in all expressions of life. An\r\nessential feature in such a character was high-mindedness and a\r\nself-respect which was of the nature of pride. On the contrary,\r\nChristian teaching exalted humility as one of the highest virtues, and\r\nregarded pride and self-confidence as the deadliest of sins. It\r\nrecognized no doctrine of limitation; what was to be condemned could not\r\nbe abhorred too violently, nor could what was good be too strongly\r\ndesired or too ardently sought. The highest state attainable by man was\r\nabsorption in loving ecstasy in the mystic contemplation of God. The\r\npractical attempt to realize this gave rise to monasticism, with its\r\nminutely regulated life expressing unlimited obedience and the\r\nrenunciation of private will at every moment. The monastic life was\r\nregarded as the nearest approach to the ideal which a Christian could\r\nmake on earth. Naturally, as this conception gathered strength in\r\ngenerations nurtured in it, the value of classical culture became less\r\nand less apparent, and by the time of St Gregory the Great (d. 604) the\r\nuse of classical literature except as means of an education having quite\r\nanother end than classical culture was discouraged.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Effect of barbarian inroads.\r\n\r\nOf course, during these centuries, the gradual subjugation of the\r\nwestern empire by the barbarians had been powerfully operative in the\r\nobscuring of culture. Most of the public schools disappeared, and\r\ngenerally the light of learning was kept burning only in monasteries,\r\nand in them more and more faintly as they became more or less isolated\r\nunits exposed to attack by ruthless foes or living in continual dread of\r\nsuch attack. Though the barbarians absorbed the old culture in various\r\ndegrees of imperfection, yet the four centuries following the death of\r\nSt Augustine were plunged in intellectual darkness, relieved by\r\ntransitory gleams of light in Britain and by a more enduring flame in\r\nIreland. The utmost that could be done was to preserve to some extent\r\nthe heritage of the past. This, indeed, was essentially the work of men\r\nlike Boethius, Cassiodorus, Isidore and Bede.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Modification of Latin.\r\n\r\nDuring these same centuries another process had been advancing with\r\naccelerating steps. This was the modification of the Latin language. In\r\nthe early centuries of Christianity literary Latin was already very\r\ndifferent from colloquial Latin, especially in the provinces; and, as\r\nhas been said, the literary output of the last age of Paganism was\r\nmarked by sterility of thought and meretricious redundancy of\r\nexpression. On the other hand, the writings of Christianity show a real\r\nliving force seeking to find appropriate expression in new forms. Thus,\r\nwith Christian writers, slavish imitation of the past gradually gave way\r\nto the evolution of a new and living Latin, which showed itself more and\r\nmore regardless of classical models. To express the new ideas to which\r\nChristianity gave birth fresh words were coined, or borrowed from\r\ncolloquial speech or from the Hebrew and Greek Scriptures. This\r\nChristian Latin was a real living instrument of expression, which\r\nconformed itself in its structure much more closely to the mode of\r\nthought and expression of actual life than did the artificial imitation\r\nof antiquity in which the literary productions of Paganism were clothed.\r\nIt is the Latin in which St Jerome wrote the Vulgate. But with the\r\nobscuring of culture during the barbarian invasions this current Latin\r\nbecame more and more oblivious of even such elements of form as\r\ngrammatical inflexions and concords.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Carolingian revival.\r\n\r\nIt was to the reformation of this corrupt Latin by a return to classical\r\nmodels, and to the more general spread of culture, especially among\r\nclergy and nobles, that the Carolingian revival addressed itself. The\r\nmovement was essentially practical and conservative. Alcuin (735-804),\r\nwho was Charlemagne's educational adviser and chief executive officer in\r\nscholastic matters, was probably the best scholar of his time, and\r\nhimself loved the classical writings with which he was acquainted; but\r\nthe text-books he wrote were but imperfect summaries of existing\r\ncompendia, and the intellectual condition of his pupils forbade a very\r\ngenerous literary diet even had he thought it desirable, of which there\r\nis some doubt. The most valuable outcome of the movement was the\r\nestablishment of the palace school, and of bishops' schools and\r\nmonastic schools throughout the empire. Of these the latter were the\r\nmost important, and each of the chief monasteries had from the time of\r\nCharlemagne an external school for pupils not proposing to enter the\r\norder as well as an internal school for novices. Thus, the educational\r\nsystem north of the Alps was pre-eminently ecclesiastical in its\r\norganization and profoundly religious in its aims. For two centuries the\r\nnew intellectual life was obscured by the troubled times which followed\r\nthe death of Charlemagne, but the learning which the Carolingian revival\r\nhad restored was preserved here and there in cathedral and monastic\r\nschools, and the sequence of well-educated ecclesiastics was never\r\naltogether interrupted.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The medieval curriculum.\r\n\r\nThe scope of that learning was comprised within the seven liberal arts\r\nand philosophy, on the secular side, together with some dogmatic\r\ninstruction in the doctrines of the Church, the early fathers, and the\r\nScriptures. Theology was as yet not organized into a philosophical\r\nsystem: that was the great work the middle ages had to perform. The\r\nseven liberal arts (divided into the _Trivium_--grammar, dialectic,\r\nrhetoric; and the more advanced _Quadrivium_--geometry, arithmetic,\r\nmusic, astronomy) were a legacy from old Roman education through the\r\ntransition centuries. They appear in the _Disciplinarum libri IX._ of\r\nVarro in the 2nd century B.C., where are added to them the more\r\nutilitarian arts of medicine and architecture. But they reached the\r\nmiddle ages chiefly through the summaries of writers in the transition\r\ncenturies, of which the best known were the _De nuptiis Philologiae et\r\nMercurii_ of the Neo-platonist Martianus Capella, who wrote probably\r\nearly in the 5th century; the _De artibus ac disciplinis liberalium\r\nlitterarum_ of the Christian Cassiodorus (468-562); and the\r\n_Etymologiarum libri XX._ of St Isidore of Seville (570-636).\r\n\r\nThe scope of the arts was wider than their names would suggest in modern\r\ntimes. Under grammar was included the study of the content and form of\r\nliterature; and in practice the teaching varied from a liberal literary\r\nculture to a dry and perfunctory study of just enough grammar to give\r\nsome facility in the use of Latin. Dialectic was mainly formal logic.\r\nRhetoric covered the study of law, as well as composition in prose and\r\nverse. Geometry was rather what is now understood by geography and\r\nnatural history, together with the medicinal properties of plants.\r\nArithmetic, with the cumbrous Roman notation, included little more than\r\nthe simplest practical calculations required in ordinary life and the\r\ncomputation of the calendar. Music embraced the rules of the plain-song\r\nof the Church, some theory of sound, and the connexion of harmony and\r\nnumbers. Astronomy dealt with the courses of the heavenly bodies, and\r\nwas seldom kept free from astrology. In philosophy the current\r\ntext-books were the _De consolatione philosophiae_ of Boethius\r\n(470-524), an eclectic summary of pagan ethics from the standpoint of\r\nthe Christian view of life, and the same writer's adapted translations\r\nof the _Categories_ and _De interpretatione_ of Aristotle and of\r\nPorphyry's _Introduction to the Categories_.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that though such a scheme of studies might in practice,\r\nduring ages of intellectual stagnation and general ignorance, be arid in\r\nthe extreme, it was capable in time of revival of giving scope to the\r\nwidest extension of culture. It was, indeed, at once comprehensive and\r\nunified in conception, and well adapted to educate for the perfectly\r\ndefinite and clear view of life which the Church set before men.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The scholastic revival.\r\n\r\nIn the 11th century Europe had settled down, after centuries of war and\r\ninvasion, into a condition of comparative political stability,\r\necclesiastical discipline, and social tranquillity: the barbarians had\r\nbeen converted, and, as in the case of the Normans, had pressed to the\r\nforefront of civilization; civic life had developed in the fortified\r\ntowns of Italy, raised as defences against the pressure of Saracen and\r\nHungarian invasions. Soon, communication with the East by trade and in\r\nthe Crusades, and with the highly cultivated Moors in Spain, further\r\nstimulated the new burst of intellectual life. Arabic renderings of some\r\nof the works of Aristotle and commentaries on them were translated into\r\nLatin and exercised a profound influence on the trend of culture. A new\r\ntranslation of Aristotle's _Metaphysics_ appeared in 1167, and by the\r\nbeginning of the 13th century all his physical, metaphysical and ethical\r\ntreatises were available, and during the next half century the\r\ntranslations from Arabic versions were superseded by renderings direct\r\nfrom the original Greek. As expositions of the real doctrines of\r\nAristotle the translations from the Arabic left much to be desired.\r\nRenan calls the medieval edition of the _Commentaries_ of Averroes \"a\r\nLatin translation of a Hebrew translation of a commentary made upon an\r\nArabic translation of a Syriac translation of a Greek text.\" The study\r\nof such works often led to the enunciation of doctrines held heretical\r\nby the theologians, and it was only when the real Aristotle was known\r\nthat it was found possible to bring the Peripatetic philosophy into the\r\nservice of theology.\r\n\r\nThere were thus two broad stages in the educational revival commonly\r\nknown as scholasticism. In the first the controversies were essentially\r\nmetaphysical, and centred round the question of the nature of\r\nuniversals; the orthodox theological party generally supporting realism,\r\nor the doctrine that the universal is the true reality, of which\r\nparticulars and individuals are only appearances; while the opposite\r\ndoctrine of nominalism--that universals are \"mere sounds\" and\r\nparticulars the only true existences--showed a continual disposition to\r\nlapse into heresies on the most fundamental doctrines of the Church. The\r\nsecond stage was essentially constructive; the opposition of philosophy\r\nto theology was negated, and philosophy gave a systematic form to\r\ntheology itself. The most characteristic figure of the former period was\r\nAbelard (1079-1142), of the latter St Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274). The\r\nformer knew little of Aristotle beyond the translations and adaptations\r\nof Boethius, but he was essentially a dialectician who applied his logic\r\nto investigating the fundamental doctrines of the Church and bringing\r\neverything to the bar of reason. This innate rationalism appeared to\r\nbring theology under the sway of philosophy, and led to frequent\r\ncondemnations of his doctrines as heretical. With St Thomas, on the\r\nother hand, the essential dogmas of Christianity must be unquestioned.\r\nIn his _Summa theologiae_ he presents all the doctrines of the Church\r\nsystematized in a mould derived from the Aristotelian philosophy.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Scholastic education.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, then, that during the period of the scholastic revival,\r\nmen's interests were specially occupied with questions concerning the\r\nspiritual and the unseen, and that the great instrument of thought was\r\nsyllogistic logic, by which consequences were deduced from premises\r\nreceived as unquestionably true. There was a general acceptance of the\r\nauthority of the Church in matters of belief and conduct, and of that of\r\nAristotle, as approved by the Church, in all that related to knowledge\r\nof this world.\r\n\r\nBefore the rediscovery of Aristotle exerted such a general influence on\r\nthe form of education, there was a real revival of classical literary\r\nculture at Chartres and a few other schools, and John of Salisbury (d.\r\n1182) in his _Metalogicus_ advocated literature as an instrument of\r\neducation and lamented the barrenness of a training confined to the\r\nsubtleties of formal logic. But the recrudescence of Aristotle\r\naccelerated the movement in favour of dialectic, though at the same time\r\nit furnished topics on which logic could be exercised which only a bare\r\nmaterialism can esteem unimportant. The weaknesses of the general\r\neducational system which grew up within scholasticism were that haste to\r\nbegin dialectic led to an undue curtailment of previous liberal culture,\r\nand that exclusive attention to philosophical and theological questions\r\ncaused a neglect of the study of the physical world and a disregard of\r\nthe critical functions of the intellect. Doubtless there were\r\nexceptions, of which perhaps the most striking is the work in physical\r\nscience done at Oxford by Roger Bacon (1214-1294). But Albertus Magnus\r\n(1193-1280), the master of St Thomas, was also a student of nature and\r\nan authority for his day on both the natural and the physical sciences.\r\nAnd the work of Grosseteste (d. 1253), as chancellor of the university\r\nof Oxford, shows that care for a liberal literary culture was by no\r\nmeans unknown. Always there were such examples. But too often boys\r\nhastened to enter upon dialectic and philosophy as soon as they had\r\nacquired sufficient smattering of colloquial Latin to engage in the\r\ndisputes of the schools. A deterioration of Latin was the unavoidable\r\nconsequence of such premature specialization. The seven liberal arts\r\nwere often not pursued in their entirety, and students remained\r\nsatisfied with desiccated compendia of accepted opinions. Thus the\r\nencyclopaedias of general information which were in general use during\r\nthe middle ages show little or no advance in positive knowledge upon the\r\ntreatment of similar subjects in Isidore of Seville.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The foundation of universities.\r\n\r\nThe services of scholasticism to the cause of education, however, cannot\r\nwell be overestimated, and the content of scholastic studies was in\r\nfundamental harmony with the intellectual interests of the time. Above\r\nall other benefits owed by future ages to scholasticism is the\r\nfoundation of the universities of western Europe. The intellectual\r\nactivity of the 11th century led everywhere to a great increase in the\r\nnumber of scholars attending the monastic and cathedral schools. Round\r\nfamous teachers, such as Abelard, gathered crowds of students from every\r\ncountry. In the 12th century the need for organizing such bodies of\r\nteachers and students was imperative, and thus the earlier universities\r\narose in Italy, France and England, not by deliberate foundation of\r\nsecular or ecclesiastical ruler, but as spontaneous manifestations of\r\nthe characteristic medieval impulse to organize into institutions.\r\nAfterwards, charters conferring powers and privileges were sought from\r\nboth Church and state, but these only confirmed the self-governing\r\ncharacter the universities had borne from the first. Each of the early\r\nuniversities was a specialized school of higher study: Salerno was a\r\nschool of medicine; Bologna was the centre of that revival of Roman law\r\nwhich wrought so profound an effect upon the legal systems of France and\r\nGermany towards the close of the medieval period. But the greatest of\r\nmedieval universities was that of Paris, emphatically the home of\r\nphilosophy and theology, which was the model upon which many other\r\nuniversities, including Oxford and Cambridge, were organized.\r\n\r\nThe German universities were of later origin, the earliest being Prague\r\n(1348) and Vienna (1365). They indicate the more recognized position the\r\nmovement had attained; for nearly all were founded by the civic\r\nauthority, and then obtained the recognition of the Church and charters\r\nfrom the emperor.\r\n\r\n\r\n  University work and life.\r\n\r\nThe concentration of higher instruction in universities was not\r\nantagonistic to the medieval conception of the Church as the teacher of\r\nmankind. University life was modelled on that of the cloister, though\r\nthe monastic ideal could not be fully realized, and the scholars not\r\ninfrequently exhibited considerable licence in life. This was inevitable\r\nwith the very large numbers of the scholars and the great variations of\r\nage among them. Moreover students, and to a less extent teachers, passed\r\nfrom university to university, so that the universities of medieval\r\nEurope formed a free confederacy of learning in close relation to the\r\nChurch but untrammelled by state control. Nevertheless, they were less\r\ndefinitely ecclesiastical than the cathedral seminaries which they\r\nlargely supplanted, and the introduction of studies derived from the\r\nGreeks through the Arabians led to an increased freedom of thought, at\r\nfirst within authorized limits, but prepared, when occasion served, to\r\ntranscend those limits.\r\n\r\nThe scheme of instruction was arranged on the assumption that special\r\nstudies should be based on a wide general culture. Thus of the four\r\nfaculties into which university teaching was organized, that of arts,\r\nwith its degrees of _Baccalaureat_ and _Magister_, was regarded as\r\npropaedeutic to those of theology, law and medicine. It often included,\r\nindeed, quite young boys, for the distinction between grammar school and\r\nuniversity was not clearly drawn. Attention was concentrated on those\r\nsubjects which treat of man and his relations to his fellow-men and to\r\nGod, and no attempt was made to extend the bounds of knowledge. The aim\r\nwas to pass on a body of acquired knowledge regarded as embracing all\r\nthat was possible of attainment, and the authority of Aristotle in\r\nphysics as well as in philosophy, and of Galen and Hippocrates in\r\nmedicine was absolute. The methods of instruction--by lecture, or\r\ncommentary on received texts; and by disputation, in which the scholars\r\nacquired dexterity in the use of the knowledge they had absorbed--were\r\nin harmony with this conception, and were undoubtedly thoroughly well\r\nsuited to the requirements of an age in which the ideal of human thought\r\nwas not discovery but order, and in which knowledge was regarded as a\r\nset of established propositions, the work of reason being to harmonize\r\nthese propositions in subordination to the authoritative doctrines of\r\nthe Church.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Medieval schools.\r\n\r\nSuch an extension of the means of higher education as was given by the\r\nuniversities was naturally accompanied by a corresponding increase in\r\nschools of lower rank. Not only were there grammar schools at cathedral\r\nand collegiate churches, but many others were founded in connexion with\r\nchantries, and by some of the many gilds into which medieval\r\nmiddle-class life organized itself. The Dominican and Franciscan friars\r\nwere enthusiastic promoters of learning both in universities and in\r\nschools, and in the Netherlands the Brethren of the Common Life, founded\r\nby Gerard Groote and approved by Eugenius IV. in 1431, regarded school\r\nteaching as one of their main functions, and the promotion of learning\r\nby the multiplication of manuscripts as another. The curriculum was\r\nrepresented broadly by the _Trivium_. The greatest attention was paid to\r\ngrammar, which included very various amounts of reading of classical and\r\nChristian authors, the most commonly included being Virgil, parts of\r\nOvid and Cicero, and Boethius. The text-books in grammar were the\r\nelementary catechism on the eight parts of speech by Donatus, a Roman of\r\nthe 4th century, said to have been the tutor of St Jerome, and the more\r\nadvanced treatise of Priscian, a schoolmaster of Constantinople about\r\nA.D. 500, which remained the standard text-book for over a thousand\r\nyears. In rhetoric Cicero's _De oratore_ was read, and dialectic was\r\npractised, as in the universities, by means of disputations.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the grammar schools were writing and song schools of an\r\nelementary type, in which instruction was usually in the vernacular.\r\nGirls were taught in women's monasteries and in the home, and those of\r\nthe upper classes at least very generally learned to read, write and\r\nkeep accounts, as well as fine needlework, household duties and\r\nmanagement, and such elementary surgery and medicine as served in cases\r\nof slight daily accidents and illnesses. Even those boys and girls who\r\ndid not receive formal scholastic instruction were instructed orally by\r\nthe parish priests in the doctrines and duties of the Faith; while the\r\npictures and statues with which the churches were adorned aided the\r\ndirect teaching of sermons and catechizing in giving a general knowledge\r\nof Bible history and of the legends of the saints.\r\n\r\nNo doubt, in times of spiritual and intellectual lethargy, the practice\r\nfell short of the theory; but on the whole it may be concluded that in\r\nmedieval times the provision for higher instruction was adequate to the\r\ndemand, and that, relatively to the culture of the time, the mass of the\r\npeople were by no means sunk in brutish ignorance. Indeed, especially\r\nwhen the paucity of books before the invention of printing is borne in\r\nmind, the number of people who could read the vernacular, as evidenced\r\nby the demand for books in the vulgar tongue as soon as printing made\r\nthem available, is clear proof that the latter part of the middle ages\r\nwas by no means a time of general illiteracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Education of chivalry.\r\n\r\nFeudalism, the other characteristic aspect of medieval society, had also\r\nits system of education, expressing its own view of life, and preparing\r\nfor the adequate performance of its duties. This was the training in\r\nchivalry given to pages and squires in the halls and castles of the\r\ngreat. Hallam has well said: \"There are, if I may so say, three powerful\r\nspirits which have from time to time moved over the face of the waters,\r\nand given a predominant impulse to the moral sentiments and energies of\r\nmankind. These are the spirits of liberty, of religion and of honour. It\r\nwas the principal business of chivalry to animate and cherish the last\r\nof these.\" And this was not in opposition to the spirit of religion\r\nwhich animated the scholastic education which went on side by side with\r\nit. Throughout chivalry was sanctified by the offices of the Church. The\r\neducation of chivalry aimed at fitting the noble youth to be a worthy\r\nknight, a just and wise master, and a prudent manager of an estate. Much\r\nwas acquired by daily experience of a knightly household, but in\r\naddition the page received direct instruction in reading and writing;\r\ncourtly amusements, such as chess and playing the lute, singing and\r\nmaking verses; the rules and usages of courtesy; and the knightly\r\nconception of duty. As a squire he practised more assiduously the\r\nknightly exercises of war and peace, and in the management of large or\r\nsmall bodies of men he attained the capacity of command.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Decadence of scholasticism.\r\n\r\nWith the unification of existing knowledge and the systematization of\r\ntheology the constructive work of scholasticism was done. At the same\r\ntime the growth of national feeling was slowly but surely undermining\r\nfeudalism. Moreover, deep resentment was accumulating throughout western\r\nEurope against the practical abuses which had become prevalent in the\r\nChurch, and especially in the court of Rome and in the prince-bishoprics\r\nof Germany. In short, Europe was out-growing medieval institutions,\r\nwhich appeared more and more as empty forms unable to satisfy the needs\r\nand longings of the human soul. In such conditions, the customary and\r\ntraditional education of school and university tended to lose touch more\r\nand more completely with the new aspirations and views of life which\r\nwere everywhere gathering adherents among the keenest and most active\r\nintellects. Had a new cultural movement not begun, the education of\r\nEurope threatened to become as arid as the rhetorical education of the\r\nlast centuries of the Roman empire had been. From this it was saved by\r\nthe renaissance of classical studies which began in the 14th century.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Renaissance.\r\n\r\nItaly, by its greater wealth and its more intimate commerce with the\r\neastern empire, was the seed-plot of this new tree of knowledge. Ever\r\nsince the 11th century the cities of northern Italy had been in advance\r\nof Europe beyond the Alps both in culture and in material progress. The\r\nold classical spirit and the feeling of Roman citizenship had never\r\nquite died out, and the _Divina Commedia_ of Dante (1265-1321) furnishes\r\nevidence that the poet of the scholastic philosophical theology was also\r\na keen student and lover of the old Latin poets. But the greatest\r\nimpulse to the revived study of the classics was given by Petrarch\r\n(1304-1374) and Boccaccio (1313-1375). Generally throughout western\r\nEurope the 14th century, though full of war and political unrest, was a\r\ntime of considerable intellectual activity, shown in the increase of\r\nschools and universities, as well as in the literary and artistic\r\nrevival in Italy, in the social and theological movement in England and\r\nBohemia associated with the names of Wycliffe and Huss, and in the more\r\nor less perfect substitution of Roman law everywhere except in England\r\nfor the law of custom which had hitherto prevailed.\r\n\r\nBut it was the literary movement which most affected education, and\r\nindeed the whole life of Europe. A decisive step was taken when Manuel\r\nChrysoloras was invited to teach Greek in the university of Florence in\r\n1397. The enthusiasm for classical culture, to which Petrarch had given\r\nso great an impetus, gathered force and extended over the whole of\r\nItaly, though, of course, felt only by a select few and leaving the mass\r\nof the people little, if at all, affected. From Italy it spread\r\ngradually to countries north of the Alps. In the old writers men found\r\nfull expression of that new spirit of self-conscious freedom which was\r\nvaguely striving for expression throughout the whole of Christendom. In\r\nthe free political atmosphere of the Italian communes, with their\r\nwealthy and leisured merchant class, that spirit could flourish much\r\nmore readily than in the feudalized Europe across the Alps. Moreover,\r\nthe antique spirit was in direct line of ancestry with that of medieval\r\nItaly. Thus, for a couple of centuries, Italy stood in the van of\r\nEuropean culture.\r\n\r\nThe stages of the movement cannot be traced here: suffice it to say it\r\nshowed itself especially in an enthusiastic search for manuscripts,\r\nfollowed by their multiplication and wider distribution; in an intense\r\ndevotion to literary form; in a revival of classic taste in\r\narchitecture; in a wonderful development of painting and sculpture from\r\nsymbolism of spiritual qualities towards naturalism and romanticism; in\r\na return to Platonism in philosophy; in a contempt, often unreasoning\r\nand wanting a foundation in knowledge, for the scholastic Aristotelian\r\nphilosophy itself, and not simply for the trivialities into which its\r\nactual exercise had so commonly degenerated. The invention of printing\r\nnecessarily gave the movement both a stronger and a wider influence than\r\nit could otherwise have attained. And in its search after knowledge it\r\nwas in full harmony with the spirit of adventure which marked the age,\r\nand by the discovery of the New World wrought so profound a change in\r\nthe relative importance and prosperity of the countries of western\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Influence of the Renaissance on education.\r\n\r\nIt is the spirit of the movement which is of interest to the student of\r\neducation. And that spirit was essentially one of opposition to\r\nauthority and of assertion of individual liberty, which worked itself\r\nout in various forms among peoples of different temperaments. In Italy\r\nthe form was literary and artistic, and the full development of the\r\nRenaissance spirit was seen in a practical Paganism which substituted\r\nthe attractions of art for the claims of religion and morality, and\r\neventuated in deep and widespread immorality and a contemptuous\r\ntolerance of the outward observances of religion without faith in the\r\ndoctrines they symbolized. The movement became an attempt to\r\nreconstitute the past intellectual life of Italy, and, as such, was\r\nforedoomed to sterility as soon as the work of re-discovery was\r\ncompleted; for the revived forms were not inspired with the vital spirit\r\nwhich had once made them realities, and consequently men's minds once\r\nagain were occupied with mere verbal subtleties. The really valuable\r\nservice of the Italian humanists to Europe was the restoration to man of\r\nthe heritage of knowledge which he had allowed to slip from his grasp,\r\nand the leading the way to a freer intellectual atmosphere. In Germany\r\nthe spirit manifested itself in a rebellion against the doctrinal system\r\nof the Church as the only effectual means of attaining reform of\r\necclesiastical abuses. The Protestant reformation of Luther was the real\r\nGerman outcome of the Renaissance. In no other country of Europe did the\r\nmovement take so distinctive a form.\r\n\r\nIt was, then, not merely the revival of interest in classical studies\r\nwhich so profoundly affected the life and education of western Europe.\r\nIt was rather that in those literatures men found a response to\r\nintellectual and moral cravings which had been blindly gathering force\r\nfor generations, and which found themselves formulated and objectified\r\nin the writings which set forth the Pagan view of life with its\r\nassumption of the essential worth and self-reliance of the individual\r\nand its frank delight in all the pleasures of existence. It was, in\r\nshort, in proportion as men not only found delight in Pagan literature\r\nbut returned in essence to the Pagan view of individual worth and the\r\nsupremacy of the human intellect, that the Church realized the danger to\r\nherself which lurked in the new movement.\r\n\r\nAt first the revival of interest in the classical literatures did not\r\nshow any antagonism to Catholic faith and practice, and its warmest\r\nsupporters were faithful sons of the Church. The view of the relation of\r\nclassical literature to Christianity adopted by the great humanist\r\nschoolmaster Vittorino da Feltre (1378-1446) was broadly that of the\r\nearly Fathers, and in his school at Mantua he showed that culture was\r\nnot inconsistent with loyalty to the Church or with purity of life. With\r\nhim classical literature was not the end and sum of education, but was a\r\nmeans of implanting ideas, of developing taste, and of acquiring\r\nknowledge, all as helps and ornaments of a Christian life. Though Pagan\r\nliterature was the means of education, the Pagan spirit had not\r\nsupplanted that of Christianity. The school at Mantua may, indeed, be\r\nsaid to have exhibited in practice a Christianized application of the\r\ndoctrines of Quintilian and Plutarch.\r\n\r\nSo was it in the other countries of Christendom. In the Netherlands the\r\nBrethren of the Common Life introduced humanistic studies into their\r\nschools side by side with definite religious teaching and observances\r\nand their work was always dominated by the Christian spirit. The\r\nearlier German humanists, such as Nicholas de Cusa, Hegius, Agricola and\r\nWimpheling, adopted the same attitude, and Erasmus himself, bitterly as\r\nhe attacked the practical abuses of the Church, remained in communion\r\nwith it, and aimed at harmonizing classical culture with the Christian\r\nlife. In England the same love of culture combined with devotion to the\r\nChurch was seen in Selling, prior of Christ Church, Canterbury, the\r\nfirst real English humanist, in Grocyn, Linacre, More, Fisher, Colet and\r\nmany others whose enthusiasm for culture was as undoubted as was their\r\nloyalty to Catholicism. It seemed, then, at first as if the greatest\r\neducational effect of the classical revival would be the deepening of\r\nliterary culture, and the substitution of real inquiry for dialectic\r\nsubtleties in the courses of schools and universities, without any break\r\nwith established religious teaching. It is true that the majority of\r\nschools were but little affected, and many of the universities had given\r\nbut a half-hearted welcome to humanistic studies when the religious\r\nrevolt in Germany under the leadership of Luther threw the whole of\r\nEurope into two hostile camps. But even the conservative university of\r\nParis--the headquarters of scholastic philosophical theology--had\r\npermitted the teaching of Greek as early as 1458, and both Oxford and\r\nCambridge had welcomed the new studies. That the influence of the new\r\nmovement for classical study was gradually permeating the schools is\r\nshown not only by the practice of the Brethren of the Common Life but by\r\nthe curriculum laid down by the statutes of the schools refounded by\r\nWolsey at Ipswich and by Colet at St Paul's.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Immediate influence of the Reformation on education.\r\n\r\nThe immediate effect of the religious controversies of the 16th century\r\non education was emphatically, if unintentionally, disastrous. The\r\nsecularization of ecclesiastical property too often absorbed the\r\nendowments of the schools, so that, both in Germany and in England, the\r\nmajority of grammar schools either disappeared or continued a starved\r\nexistence with diminished funds; the doctrine of salvation by faith\r\nalone and the futility of good works dried up the source from which such\r\nendowments had flowed; the violent fulminations of the German reformers\r\nagainst the universities as the homes of the hated scholastic theology\r\nand philosophy found an echo in minds fired with the renaissance\r\nenthusiasm for poetry and oratory, and correlative distaste for the more\r\nsevere and abstract speculations of logic and philosophy, which\r\nexpressed itself in abstention from those seats of learning; the\r\npreoccupation of men's minds with theological speculations and quarrels\r\nled those few who did resort to the universities to neglect their\r\nappointed studies and to devote their energies to interminable wrangling\r\nover the points in dispute. This decadence in culture was attended by an\r\noutbreak of licence and immorality, especially among the young, which\r\ncalled forth violent denunciations from Luther and many of his followers\r\nin Germany, and from Latimer and other reformers in England. In some\r\nrespects these results were only transitory. Humanism and Protestantism,\r\nwhich had so far diverged that Erasmus (1467-1536) had declared that\r\nwhere Lutheranism flourished learning decayed, were brought together\r\nagain by Melanchthon (1497-1560) under whose influence universities were\r\nfounded or reorganized and schools re-established in Protestant German\r\nstates; and in England the reign of Elizabeth saw many new educational\r\nfoundations. But this restoration of the means of education was only\r\npartial, and the doctrine of the worthlessness of \"carnal knowledge,\"\r\nwhich led the Barebones Parliament to propose the suppression of the\r\nEnglish universities, was held by many fervent Protestants both in\r\nEngland and in Germany all through the 17th century.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Protestant schools.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the schools established a tradition of curriculum and\r\ninstruction which ignored the new directions of men's thoughts and the\r\nnew view of knowledge as something to be enlarged, and not merely a\r\ndeposit to be handed down from generation to generation. The later\r\nhumanist theories of education, which the schools continued to follow\r\ngenerally for over two centuries, and in many cases for another hundred\r\nyears after that, were drawn mainly from Erasmus and Melanchthon, who\r\nfound in the classical languages and literatures, and especially in\r\nLatin, the only essential instruments of education. General knowledge of\r\nnatural facts might be desirable to the cultured man as ornaments to his\r\nrhetoric, but it was to be sought in the writings of antiquity. Even so\r\nrevolutionary a thinker on education as Rabelais (1495-1553) with all\r\nhis demand for an encyclopaedic curriculum, held the writings of the\r\nancients as authoritative on natural phenomena. Melanchthon, whose\r\nconception of instruction was much narrower, exercised enormous\r\ninfluence in the moulding of Protestant universities and secondary\r\nschools, both directly and through such disciples as Trotzendorf and\r\nNeander, but especially through his friend Sturm (1507-1589), whose\r\nLatin gymnasium at Strassburg became the model which the grammar schools\r\nof Protestant Europe strove to imitate. In this school nearly the whole\r\nof the energies of the boys was given to acquiring a mastery of the\r\nLatin language after the model of Cicero. Sturm, indeed, did not go to\r\nthe extreme length of the Ciceronians, opposed and satirized by Erasmus,\r\nwho would allow no word or construction which could not be found in the\r\nextant writings of their master, but a like spirit dominated him.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Society of Jesus.\r\n\r\nIn Catholic countries the Church retained control of education. The\r\npractical reformation of abuses by the Council of Trent, and the energy\r\nand skill of the Society of Jesus, founded by St Ignatius Loyola, in\r\n1534, brought back most of south Germany into the fold of the Church.\r\nEverywhere Catholic universities were mainly taught by Jesuit fathers;\r\nand under their influence, scholasticism, purged from the excretions\r\nwhich had degraded it, was restored, and continued to satisfy the\r\nlongings of minds which felt the need of an authoritative harmonizing of\r\nfaith and knowledge. Everywhere the society established schools, which,\r\nby their success in teaching and the mildness of their discipline,\r\nattracted thousands of pupils who came even from Protestant homes. Their\r\ncurriculum was purely classical, but it was elaborated with much skill,\r\nand the methods of instruction and discipline were made the subject of\r\nmuch thought and of long-continued experiment. In the methods thus\r\ndetermined all Jesuit fathers were trained, so that the teachers in\r\nJesuit schools attained a degree of skill in their art which was too\r\ngenerally wanting elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Early proposals for reform.\r\n\r\nSo long as Latin remained the language of learning, and new fields of\r\nknowledge were not appropriated, the schools remained in harmony with\r\nthe culture of their time, though, as Mulcaster (1530-1611) pointed out,\r\nsuch a training was not of value to the majority of boys. For them he\r\nurged an elementary education in the vernacular; but neither in this nor\r\nin his advocacy of the training of teachers was his advice followed.\r\n\r\nIn the 17th century the dislocation between the Latin schools and the\r\nneeds of life began to be accentuated as Latin gradually ceased to be\r\nthe language of learning; and, as a consequence, the numbers attending\r\nthe schools decreased, and the mass of the people sunk continually lower\r\nin ignorance. In vain Hoole urged the establishment of a universal\r\nsystem of elementary schools giving instruction in the vernacular, Petty\r\nput forth his plan for elementary trade schools, and Cowley proposed the\r\nestablishment of a college devoted to research. Ideas of reform were in\r\nthe air, but the main current of scholastic practice flowed on\r\nunaffected by them. Some attention was, indeed, paid to the conservative\r\nreforms advocated by the Port Royalists, of which the most important was\r\nthe inclusion of the vernacular as a branch of instruction, but the cry\r\nfor more fundamental changes based on the philosophy of Bacon was\r\nunheeded. Of these, none was a more active propagandist than Comenius\r\n(1571-1635). Unfortunately his _Great Didactic_, in which he set forth\r\nhis general principles, attracted little attention and won less\r\nadherence, though his school books, in which he attempted with very\r\nlittle success to apply his principles, were widely used in schools. But\r\nthese were little more than bald summaries of real and supposed facts,\r\nstated in Latin and the vernacular in parallel columns. In content they\r\ndiffered from such medieval summaries of knowledge as the well-known\r\nwork of Bartholomew Anglicus, which had been widely used since the 13th\r\ncentury, chiefly by their greater baldness and aridity of statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Decadence of universities.\r\n\r\nIn the universities, too, the 16th and 17th centuries saw a continuous\r\ndecadence. The 16th century was not ripe for real intellectual freedom;\r\nand Protestantism, having based its revolt on the right of private\r\njudgment, soon produced a number of conflicting theological systems,\r\nvying with each other in rigidity and narrowness, which, as Paulsen\r\nsays, \"nearly stifled the intellectual life of the German people.\"\r\nFurther, the idea of national autonomy, which exercised so great an\r\neffect on the politics of the time, included the universal adherence of\r\nthe citizens to the religion of the state. Hence, till the end of the\r\n17th century the universities of Protestant Europe were regarded mainly\r\nas instruments for securing adhesion to the national theological system\r\non the part of future clergy and officials, and the state interfered\r\nmore and more with their organization and work. Theology occupied the\r\nmost important place in the higher studies pursued, which for the rest\r\ndiffered little in content and less in spirit from those of preceding\r\ncenturies, except that more attention was paid to the study of classical\r\nliterature. Even that decayed into formal linguistics as the Renaissance\r\nenthusiasm for poetry and oratory died out, and interest in logical and\r\nphilosophical questions, fostered by the dominance of dogmatic\r\ncontroversial theology, again became dominant. In Paris, on the other\r\nhand, the faculty of theology had decayed through the withdrawal of\r\nthose preparing for the priesthood into episcopal seminaries, and the\r\nhigher studies pursued were mainly law and medicine. Thus, generally,\r\nthe universities were less and less fulfilling the function of providing\r\na general liberal education. Another change, due to the same causes and\r\nmaking for the same results, was the isolation of universities, often\r\ndirectly fostered by the state governments, which for the universal\r\ninterchange of medieval thought substituted a narrow provincial culture\r\nand outlook. It is no wonder that numbers everywhere decayed and that\r\ncomplaints as to the habits of the students were loud and frequent.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Education of the higher classes.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the 17th century, then, universities as well as schools\r\nhad reached a very low level of efficiency and were held in little\r\nrespect by the cultured. Indeed, from the middle of the century, the\r\nmain current of intellectual life had drifted away from the orthodox\r\ncentres of learning. The formation of the Berlin Academy in Germany and\r\nof the Royal Society in England, and the refusal of Leibnitz to accept a\r\nchair in any German university, were signs of the times. In France, and\r\nlater in Germany, the education of the noble youth was increasingly\r\ncarried on apart from the schools, and was really an outgrowth from the\r\neducation of chivalry. In the 16th century Castiglione and Montaigne had\r\nadvocated a training directly adapted to prepare for polite life, and\r\nElyot wrote on similar lines. But the most important movement in this\r\ndirection was the formation of the courtly academies which flourished in\r\nFrance in the 17th century, and were soon imitated in the\r\n_Ritterakademien_ of Germany. In these schools of the nobility French\r\nwas more honoured than classics, and the other subjects were chosen as\r\ndirectly adapted to prepare for the life of a noble at the court. Milton\r\nin his _Tractate_ advocated the foundation of such academies in England,\r\nthough he proposed a curriculum far more extensive than had ever been\r\nfound possible. More and more, too, foreign travel had, from the middle\r\nof the 16th century, been looked upon as a better mode of finishing the\r\neducation of a gentleman than a course at a university.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Revival of university life.\r\n\r\nThe later years of the 17th century saw a revival of university life in\r\nCambridge, through the work of Newton and the increasing attention paid\r\nto mathematics and the physical sciences, though the number of students\r\ncontinued very small. In Germany, also, a new era opened with the\r\nfoundation of the universities of Halle (1694) and Gottingen (1737),\r\nwhich from the first discarded the old conception that the function of a\r\nuniversity is to pass on knowledge already complete, and so opened the\r\ndoor of the German universities to the new culture and philosophy. It\r\nwas soon seen that students could thus be attracted, and the influence\r\nspread to the other German universities, which by the end of the 18th\r\ncentury had regained their position as homes of the highest German\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Education of the poor.\r\n\r\nAt Halle, too, was set the example by Francke of providing for the\r\neducation of the children of the poor, and to his disciple Hecker\r\nGermany owes the first _Realschule_. Simultaneous movements for the\r\neducation of the poor were made by St Jean-Baptiste de la Salle and the\r\nBrothers of the Christian Schools in France, and by the Society for the\r\nPromotion of Christian Knowledge in England. But the total results were\r\nnot great; the mass of the people in every European country remained\r\nwithout schooling throughout the 18th century.\r\n\r\n\r\n  18th-century thought and education.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual movements of that century were, indeed, essentially\r\naristocratic. Voltaire and the Encyclopaedists aimed at the\r\nenlightenment of the select few, and Rousseau declared baldly that the\r\npoor need no education. That these movements influenced education\r\nprofoundly is undoubted. The individualistic and abstract rationalism of\r\nVoltaire, derived from the sensationist philosophy of Locke through the\r\nmore thorough-going Condillac, and finding its logical outcome in the\r\nmaterialistic atheism of La Mettrie and the refined selfishness of\r\nRochefoucault, infected the more cultured classes. In Lord\r\nChesterfield's _Letters to his Son_ is shown its educational outcome--a\r\nveneer of superficial culture and artificial politeness covering, but\r\nnot hiding, the most cold-blooded selfishness. Against this fashionable\r\nartificiality, as well as against the obvious social and political\r\nabuses of the time, Rousseau's call for a return to nature was a needed\r\nprotest.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Rousseauism.\r\n\r\nRousseauism, however, was not merely a transitory revolt against a\r\nconventionality of life that had become unbearable; it was emphatically\r\nthe voicing of a view of life and of education which has profoundly\r\ninfluenced Europe ever since. In that Rousseau (1712-1778) attempted to\r\nlook at life as a whole he was on truer ground than were the\r\nintellectualists of the \"Enlightenment\"; but in that he found the\r\nessence of life in the gratification of the desires and impulses of the\r\nmoment, he enunciated a doctrine which banished high principle and\r\nstrenuous effort from life and consequently from education. In the\r\n_Emile_ is presented a purely fantastic scheme of education based on a\r\npsychology of development so crude as to be absolutely false, and\r\nproducing a young man utterly unable to guide his own life or to control\r\nhis emotions and impulses. Rousseauism is, indeed, in its essence the\r\napplication to education of the doctrines of naturalism--the philosophy\r\nwhich regards human life as a mere continuation of physical process, and\r\nconsequently as determined wholly by environment. So Rousseau would\r\nabolish all moral training and leave the child to the reactions of the\r\nphysical world upon his actions.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Kant.\r\n\r\nAgainst this position the educational teaching of Kant (1724-1804),\r\ninfluenced though he was by the _Emile_, is essentially a protest. The\r\nmost necessary element in education, according to Kant, is constraint,\r\nwhich by the formation of habit prepares the young to receive as\r\nprinciples of conduct the laws at first imposed upon them from without.\r\nAnd the supreme guide of life is the law of duty which is always more or\r\nless opposed to the promptings of inclination. Kant exaggerates the\r\ndualism: Rousseau would abolish it by ignoring the more important of the\r\ntwo antitheses.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Educational outcome of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nThe French Revolution--the natural outcome of the teachings of Voltaire\r\nand of Rousseau--was the second stage in the movement of which the\r\nReformation was the first. It was essentially the assertion of the\r\nnatural rights of man, and, as a logical sequence, of the right of every\r\nchild to be properly trained for life. The reaction due to the excesses\r\nof the revolutionists no doubt delayed the acknowledgment for a time,\r\nbut its gradual recognition is emphatically the characteristic mark of\r\nthe educational history of the 19th century.\r\n\r\n\r\n  State education.\r\n\r\nPreached and practised by Pestalozzi (1746-1827) in Switzerland, the\r\ngeneral education of the poor was first made a reality by Prussia after\r\nthe crushing defeat of Jena. In France and England it remained for\r\nnearly three-quarters of the century the work of the Church and other\r\nvoluntary agencies, though aided by the state. Finally a state system of\r\nschools has been more or less fully set up in every state of western\r\nEurope and in America, and subjected to more or less state regulation\r\nand control. Equally marked has been the growing care for the scholastic\r\neducation of girls as well as boys, though only in America are the two\r\nregarded as practically identical in form and content.\r\n\r\nThus the 19th century saw the final working out of the idea that the\r\nstate should be substituted for the Church as the official agent of\r\neducation, an idea which had its roots in the Renaissance conception of\r\nthe right of man to direct his life apart from theological\r\ndeterminations. The more direct outcome of the same idea is apparent in\r\nthe absolute liberty with which the presuppositions of knowledge are\r\nquestioned, and the maxim of Descartes--to prove everything by the\r\nreason and to accept nothing which fails to stand the test--is acted\r\nupon. No greater contrast is possible than that between the medieval\r\nstudent and the modern searcher after truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Methods of instruction.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the same spirit has wrought an equally momentous change\r\nin the methods of instruction. The impetus given by the exaggerated\r\ndoctrine of Rousseau to the view that the nature of the child should\r\ndetermine the means of education, led to more thorough-going attempts\r\nthan had hitherto been made to base educational method on a knowledge of\r\nchild psychology. Pestalozzi and Froebel (1782-1852), by their\r\ninsistence on the need of educating a child through his own activity,\r\nand by their widespread influence, made the new view of method an\r\nactuality. The influence of Rousseau has, thus, passed into modern\r\neducational practice in a form that, in its essence, is true, though in\r\npractice it has shown itself apt to run into the same excess of emphasis\r\non impulse and feeling which vitiated the teaching of Rousseau himself.\r\nThe influence of Herbart (1776-1841) has tended to counteract this. The\r\nessence of Herbartianism is that mental life consists of presentations,\r\nor reactions of the mind on the environment, and that will springs from\r\nthe circle of thought thus developed. The emphasis is therefore placed\r\non intellect and instruction while in Froebelianism it is placed on\r\nspontaneous activity and on the arrangement of the environment. Each\r\nexaggerates the function of the one factor in concrete experience which\r\nit makes the centre of interest, and each is tinged with the\r\nindividualistic conception of life which characterized the 18th and\r\nearly 19th century.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Curriculum of instruction.\r\n\r\nThe most marked change in the outward aspect of education has been the\r\nmodification of the curriculum of school and university by the\r\nintroduction of various branches of natural science. Conjointly with\r\nthis has been much increase of specialization, and that not only in the\r\nuniversity but in the school. There is no longer a universally\r\nrecognized circle of knowledge constituting a liberal education\r\npreparatory to specialist studies, as there was in the middle ages. Nor\r\nis there general agreement as to what such educational institutions as\r\nschools and universities should attempt to do, or even as to the end\r\nthat should be sought by education as a whole. Nor can agreement on such\r\npoints be expected while men differ widely as to the meaning and purpose\r\nof life. The work of the organization of the material means of education\r\nhas largely been accomplished by the civilized world: that of\r\ndetermining the true theory and practice of the educative process itself\r\nis still incomplete. To that, both discussion of the philosophy of life\r\nand of the relative values in life, of various kinds of experience and\r\nexperiment in the light of the conclusions reached, are needed. The\r\nproblem will never be absolutely solved, for that would imply an\r\nabsolutely best education irrespective of conditions, but its practical\r\nsolution will be reached when a true adjustment is made between the\r\nprocess of education and the life for which that education is intended\r\nto be a preparation.\r\n\r\n  See also the articles ACADEMIES; CLASSICS; CO-EDUCATION; EXAMINATIONS;\r\n  POLYTECHNIC; SCHOOLS; TECHNICAL EDUCATION; UNIVERSITIES; WOMEN; &c.\r\n       (J. Wn.)\r\n\r\n\r\nII. NATIONAL SYSTEMS OF PUBLIC EDUCATION\r\n\r\nA statement of the principles commonly recognized by modern communities\r\nas governing the action of the state in relation to education may\r\nfacilitate at the outset a clearer understanding of the problems which\r\nthe organization of public education presents. The cardinal doctrine of\r\nstate interference in the educational domain is universally accepted by\r\nall the great nations of the modern world; and in regard to its extent\r\nand limits a large measure of agreement has now been reached.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Principles of state interference.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it is recognized as the duty of the state to insist\r\nupon a certain minimum of education for every future citizen. This does\r\nnot necessitate a monopoly of education on the part of the state, such\r\nas was claimed by the Napoleonic despotism under the traditional\r\ninfluence (it would seem) of the old authoritative Gallo-Roman\r\ntradition, transformed in its outward manifestation but not in its\r\ninward spirit by the French Revolution. Such a monopoly would be plainly\r\nrepugnant to the spirit of Anglo-Saxon individualism, and it is\r\ninteresting to note that attempts to reassert it have in recent times\r\nbeen repudiated in republican France by some of the best exponents of\r\nmodern free thought, as an infringement of personal liberty not\r\ncalculated to justify itself by any corresponding public gain.\r\nNevertheless, the recognition of this primary duty of the state plainly\r\nimplies a state system of at least elementary education. The masses of\r\nthe industrial population cannot afford the necessary minimum of\r\ninstruction which the public interest demands, and private and voluntary\r\neffort cannot efficiently supply the want resulting from the unequal\r\ndistribution of wealth. But it is in the nature of things that, so far\r\nas private effort attempts anything in this direction, it should be\r\nmotived in the main by religion and associated with the great historical\r\nreligious organizations; thus it comes about that the moment the state\r\nsteps in to make good the deficiency of voluntary effort a fruitful and\r\nembittering source of difficulty and friction is disclosed. Hence, in\r\nEngland, the history of public elementary education since the beginning\r\nof the 19th century has been very largely the history of what is called\r\nthe religious difficulty. Here we find ourselves in the region of acute\r\ncontroversy in which it is useless to do more than note empirically the\r\nvarious solutions adopted by different states. Perhaps all that can\r\nsafely be indicated as commanding universal acceptance is the principle\r\nthat the state must not impose upon an individual citizen in the person\r\nof his child any form of religious instruction to which he\r\nconscientiously objects. Modern controversies show the difficulty of\r\napplying even this rudimentary principle to the complicated\r\ncircumstances of a free community split up into a number of groups\r\ndiffering profoundly in religious sentiment, and zealous each for the\r\nrecognition of its own ideal within the common system. So far, however,\r\nas secular instruction (i.e. the teaching of other subjects than\r\nreligion) is concerned it is now generally accepted that the elementary\r\nminimum must be both compulsory and free for every individual child\r\nwhose parents will not or cannot (as the case may be) provide such\r\ninstruction for it efficiently elsewhere than in the state-supported\r\nschools.\r\n\r\nNext, the action of the modern state cannot stop short at elementary\r\neducation. The principle of \"the career open to talent\" is no longer a\r\nmatter of abstract humanitarian theory, a fantastical aspiration of\r\nrevolutionary dreamers; for the great industrial communities of the\r\nmodern world it is a cogent practical necessity imposed by the fierce\r\ninternational competition which prevails in the arts and industries of\r\nlife. The nation that is not to fail in the struggle for commercial\r\nsuccess, with all that this implies for national life and civilization,\r\nmust needs see that its industries are fed with a constant supply of\r\nworkers adequately equipped in respect both of general intelligence and\r\ntechnical training.\r\n\r\nOn political grounds too, the increasing democratization of\r\ninstitutions renders a wide diffusion of knowledge and the cultivation\r\nof a high standard of intelligence among the people a necessary\r\nprecaution of prudent statesmanship, especially for the great imperial\r\nstates which confide the most momentous issues of world policy to the\r\narbitrament of the popular voice. The state then must satisfy itself\r\nthat the means of education are placed within the reach of all, in\r\ngrades adapted to the varying degrees of intelligence and educational\r\nopportunity to be found among a community upon the majority of whose\r\nmembers is imposed the necessity of entering upon the practical business\r\nof life at a more or less early age. The organization of the higher\r\ngrades of education constitutes a task of less formidable magnitude than\r\nthe organization of elementary education, for the reason that, at any\r\nrate in the prevailing social conditions, it is only a minority who can\r\nbenefit by it, and that of this minority a large proportion can afford\r\nthe whole or a considerable portion of the cost in each individual case.\r\nThe class, however, whose education must needs be assisted by the state\r\nif it is not to remain inefficient must always be considerable; and\r\naccount must be taken also of the necessities of the further class whose\r\nexceptional mental development is such as to make it worth while for the\r\nstate to bestow gratuitously an education higher than elementary at the\r\npublic expense. University education is distinguished from education of\r\nthe lower grades by the fact that, being necessarily restricted to an\r\nelite of intellect or birth, it cannot, save in very exceptional\r\ncircumstances, usefully be organized locally. Although universities are\r\nthe necessary complement of a public educational system they do not in\r\nstrictness or necessity form part of such a system, and in so far as\r\nthey are brought within the purview of public authority it must be as a\r\nmatter of national, rather than municipal or provincial, concern.\r\nAccordingly university education is separately treated (see\r\nUNIVERSITIES), and will not be referred to, save incidentally, in the\r\npresent article.\r\n\r\nReserving to a final section the history of education in the United\r\nStates of America, a brief description is given here of the educational\r\nsystems of the leading European countries by way of introduction to a\r\nmore detailed, but still summary, historical sketch of public education\r\nin England. The highly organized educational systems of France and\r\nPrussia (as representing Germany) are manifestly suitable for the\r\npurposes of a general study of the principles of educational polity as\r\nworked out upon logical and consistently thought-out plans by highly\r\ncentralized states. As to other European countries, a brief mention must\r\nsuffice of certain features of special interest presented by smaller\r\nprogressive states of such different types as Switzerland, Belgium and\r\nHolland. Similarly, in the case of the United Kingdom, considerations of\r\nspace forbid more than a brief notice of the educational systems of\r\nScotland (q.v.) and Ireland (q.v.). For other countries see the sections\r\nin the articles under the headings of the respective states.\r\n\r\n\r\n_France._\r\n\r\nFrance (q.v.) presents the most complete type of a state system of\r\neducation organized under a strongly centralized administration in all\r\ngrades. This centralized administration in education, as in other\r\ndepartments, represents the Napoleonic heritage of the Republic, and,\r\nalthough there has been an increasing tendency of recent years to study\r\nlocal conditions in the internal organization of schools, anything\r\napproaching to local autonomy is unknown in educational affairs. The\r\nnecessary checks upon bureaucracy are supplied not by popularly elected\r\nmunicipal bodies but by a strong infusion of the pedagogic element in\r\nthe administrative machinery. The pedagogic element in turn does but\r\nrepresent another side of the collective activities of the state. The\r\nteaching profession both in the primary and higher spheres--and the two\r\nare sharply marked off from one another--consists of a highly organized\r\nbody of state functionaries, united by a strong _esprit de corps_ and\r\nactuated by ideals and aims which are inspired by the state. The\r\nimportance of this condition of things lies in the fact that the\r\nRepublic is something more than a form of government: it is the social\r\nand moral expression of the democratic ideal as conceived by a people\r\nprofoundly imbued by tradition with the sense of social solidarity, or\r\ncollectivism; and nowhere has this expression been more characteristic\r\nor more complete than in the domain of public education. Yet the\r\neducational system of modern France is by no means exclusively the\r\ncreation of the Third Republic, and the main stages in its development\r\ndeserve to be traced historically.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Freres de la Doctrine chretienne.\r\n\r\nNo historical sketch, however slight, of French education can ignore the\r\ngreat Catholic religious educator of the 18th century, Jean Baptiste de\r\nla Salle, the founder of _Les Freres de la Doctrine chretienne_,\r\ncommonly known as the \"Christian Brothers.\" The Brothers were not merely\r\npioneers of elementary education, they may also be regarded (as M.\r\nBuisson, formerly director of public instruction, has shown) as the\r\noriginators of higher primary instruction. Under the Restoration they\r\nupheld the method of simultaneous teaching against the partisans of the\r\nmutual (or monitorial) method, successfully demonstrating the\r\nsuperiority of the trained teacher. The unfortunate effects of the\r\nmonitorial system upon English education show the reality of the service\r\nwhich this religious congregation rendered to the national pedagogy in\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Revolution and Napoleon.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of 1791 decreed that primary instruction should be\r\ncompulsory and gratuitous. (It may be explained that the term \"free\r\neducation,\" _instruction libre_, does not bear the same meaning in\r\nFrance as in England. In France a free school means a school not under\r\nstate control and not forming part of the state system.) In this as in\r\nmuch else the Revolution was powerless to do more than enunciate general\r\nprinciples which it left for later generations, in the present instance\r\nafter the lapse of nearly a century, to carry into effect. True to its\r\ntheories of individualistic liberty, the Revolution admitted liberty of\r\nteaching. Napoleon, on the other hand, by the law of 1806, centralized\r\nall forms of education in one official teaching body under the name of\r\nthe Imperial University, thus securing a monopoly of teaching to the\r\nstate. The Napoleonic idea of the university, doubtless because a true\r\nexpression of the national genius, has never ceased to exert a profound\r\ninfluence upon French education, an influence which of late years has\r\nbeen revivified and reinforced by the modern ideal of social solidarity.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Reforms of Guizot.\r\n\r\nUnder the Restoration education fell inevitably under the control of the\r\nchurch, but under the Liberal Monarchy Guizot in 1833 passed a law which\r\nlaid the foundations of modern primary instruction, obliging the\r\ncommunes to maintain schools and pay the teachers. It is also to the\r\ncredit of Guizot as an educational reformer that he perceived the\r\nnecessity for the higher primary as distinct from the secondary school.\r\nThe higher primary schools which he founded were unfortunately\r\nsuppressed by the _Loi Falloux_; their restoration constitutes one of\r\nthe great positive services rendered by the Third Republic to the cause\r\nof popular education.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Loi Falloux.\r\n\r\nThe _Loi Falloux_ of 1850, passed by the Second Republic under the\r\ninfluence of the prince president, is chiefly memorable for its\r\nrestoration of the liberty of teaching, which in a Catholic country\r\nmeans in effect free scope for priestly schools. This law also made\r\nprovision for separate communal schools for girls, for adult classes and\r\nfor the technical instruction of apprentices. In 1854 France was divided\r\nfor purposes of educational administration into sixteen academies, each\r\nadministered by a rector with an academy inspector under him for each\r\ndepartment. This organization survives to-day, with the difference that\r\nfor each academy (except Chambery) there is now a local teaching\r\nuniversity.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ministry of M. Duruy.\r\n\r\nThe ministry of the well-known educationist M. Duruy (1865-1869),\r\ncorresponding to the period of the Liberal Empire, was notable for\r\nmarked administrative progress. A permanent memorial of this epoch is\r\nthe enactment rendering primary schools for girls obligatory in communes\r\nof over 500 inhabitants. Duruy also provided for the introduction of\r\ngratuitous instruction at the option of the commune.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Third Republic.\r\n\r\nThe task of educational reform imposed itself upon the republic by a\r\ntwofold necessity. The wars of 1866 and 1870 were victories for the\r\nPrussian schoolmaster, and aroused all western Europe to the national\r\nimportance of popular education. For France then the reform of popular\r\neducation was an essential part of the work of national restoration. For\r\nthe republic too, menaced by older and hostile traditions, the creation\r\nof a national system of education inspired by its own spirit was an\r\nessential condition of the permanence and security of its government and\r\nthe social ideals of which that government was the expression. Hence the\r\nenergy with which the republican state addressed itself to the\r\norganization of primary instruction, \"obligatory, gratuitous, secular.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  Acquisition of elementary school buildings and organization of teaching\r\n  profession.\r\n\r\nBy the law of June 1, 1878, there was imposed upon the communes the\r\nobligation of acquiring their school buildings; and as a grant in aid a\r\nsum of L2,400,000 was set aside for this purpose by the state. In 1879 a\r\nlaw was passed compelling every department to maintain a training college\r\nfor male and female teachers respectively. The two higher normal schools\r\nof Fontenay and St Cloud were also founded to supply the training\r\ncolleges with professors. During the same period, among other\r\n_certificats_ or professional diplomas, there were established the\r\n_certificat d'aptitude pedagogique_, which qualifies probationer-teachers\r\n(_stagiaires_) for appointment as teachers in full standing\r\n(_titulaires_), and the _certificat d'aptitude_ for primary inspectors\r\nand heads of normal schools. The law of June 16, 1881, rendered\r\nobligatory for all teachers, whether public or private, the _brevet de\r\ncapacite_. It was found impracticable to carry this law into immediate\r\neffect, and as late as 1902 only about 60% of the men and 52% of the\r\nwomen were provided with the professional certificate necessary for\r\nbecoming _titulaires_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Reforms of Jules Ferry. Laicization.\r\n\r\nThe laws making primary education gratuitous, compulsory and secular,\r\nare indissolubly associated with the name of Jules Ferry. The law of\r\nJune 16, 1881, abolished fees in all primary schools and training\r\ncolleges, the law of 1882 established compulsory attendance, and finally\r\nthe law of October 30, 1886, enacted that none but lay persons should\r\nteach in the public schools, and abolished in those schools all\r\ndistinctively religious teaching. In the boys' schools members of\r\nreligious communities were to be displaced within five years, but in\r\ngirls' schools the _religieuses_ might remain till death or resignation.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Moral instruction.\r\n\r\nReligious teaching was replaced in the state schools under the Ferry law\r\nby moral instruction according to official curricula, a change which has\r\nbeen described by M. Seailles (_Education ou revolution_) as a\r\nrevolution of the profoundest philosophical meaning. The difficult and\r\ndelicate topics of the relation of the state school to religion and the\r\nvalue of the substituted moral instruction have recently received\r\nilluminating and objective treatment from different points of view in\r\nthe series of reports on _Moral Instruction and Training in Schools_,\r\nedited by Professor M.E. Sadler (1908, vol. ii.); the barest reference\r\nto the questions at issue must here suffice. As regards the character of\r\nthe moral instruction, it would appear to have shifted from a Kantian to\r\na purely sociological basis. Roman Catholic opinion is at least not\r\nunanimous in regarding the \"lay\" or neutral school as essentially or\r\nnecessarily anti-religious, and plainly there is no inherent reason why\r\nthe neutrality should not be a real neutrality, but with the existing\r\nrelations between the Catholic Church and modern thought in France the\r\ninfluence of the Normalist teachers is in fact apt to be anti-religious,\r\nand moreover no system of independent moral doctrine, whether based upon\r\na priori or inductive reasoning, can be acceptable to the Roman Catholic\r\nChurch. In whatever degree the blame may be rightly apportionable\r\nbetween church and state, the fact is that the two find themselves in\r\nacute conflict, and that from the conflict there has resulted a certain\r\nmoral confusion which Christian and non-Christian moralists alike view\r\nwith alarm. It may be that the mischief would have been mitigated had\r\nmore moderate counsels prevailed at the time of the Ferry law, and had\r\nthe church been willing to accept (as the Republic might then have been\r\nwilling to concede) right of entry for the clergy into the schools. But\r\nthe real causes of the trouble lie deep in the philosophical and\r\nreligious problems of our time, and in the constant and self-sacrificing\r\ndevotion of the French to logical ideals on either side. Perhaps it is\r\nnot too sanguine to discern in the growing tendency to idealism in\r\nFrench philosophy, and to liberal ideas in French and Catholic religious\r\nthought, the promise of a happier state of things. In the meantime, the\r\nreligious difficulty in the schools divides the nation into two hostile\r\ncamps (_les deux Frances_, as a Swiss Protestant writer puts it) in the\r\nshape of the state secular schools on the one side and the private\r\nreligious schools on the other.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1903-1904 the total number of pupils in private primary\r\nschools was 1,298,591, as against 4,935,000 in the public primary\r\nschools, but these figures were liable to be materially affected by the\r\nrigorous enforcement of the laws against the religious orders.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Financial reform of 1889.\r\n\r\nIn 1889 an important change was made in educational finance by\r\ntransferring the cost of teachers' salaries in primary schools from the\r\ncommunes to the state, a right consequence of the changes which made the\r\nteacher a state official. Thus the state assumed the greater part of the\r\nburden of primary instruction, leaving to the communes merely the cost\r\nof fabric, and to the department the maintenance of the fabric of the\r\nnormal schools and certain expenses of inspection.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Administrative machinery. Minister and conseil superieur.\r\n\r\nAt this point it will be convenient to describe shortly the various\r\ncentral and local authorities that constitute the official machine. The\r\nminister, the head of the entire hierarchy, is assisted by a _conseil\r\nsuperieur_ consisting of fifty-seven members, of whom the majority are\r\nelected by the higher teaching profession, while a few are nominated by\r\nthe president, including a small number to represent private schools,\r\nand a few are elected by the primary teachers. Practically the ordinary\r\nwork of the council is carried on by a sub-committee consisting of the\r\nnine nominees of the president and six others designated for this\r\npurpose by the minister. The council has administrative, judicial and\r\ndisciplinary, as well as advisory, powers which enable it to exert a\r\ndirect influence upon the internal organization of schools. There is\r\nalso a pedagogic _comite consultatif_ and a legal _comite contentieux_,\r\nwhose respective functions are purely advisory.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Inspecteurs generaux.\r\n\r\nThe _inspecteurs generaux_ \"act,\" says Mr Brereton in his official\r\nreport to the English Board of Education, \"as the eyes and ears of the\r\ncentral authority.\" Their duties are: first to inspect the normal\r\nschools; next to supervise the work of the ordinary inspectorate; lastly\r\nto give general and comparative information on the progress of primary\r\ninstruction in the various parts of France. For the purpose of general\r\ninspection France is divided into seven districts.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Rector and council of academy.\r\n\r\nAs already indicated, for the purpose of educational administration, the\r\ndepartments of France are grouped in seventeen divisions called\r\nacademies. At the head of each academy is the rector. He is appointed\r\ndirectly by the president and must hold the doctor's degree. He is not\r\nonly the head of the local teaching university, but is also charged in a\r\ngeneral way with the oversight of all three departments of education,\r\nsuperior, secondary and primary; in regard to the last, however, his\r\nfunctions are confined to the pedagogic side. The direct share of the\r\nrector in administration is mainly confined to the normal schools and\r\nthe higher primary schools. The rector is assisted by an academic\r\ncouncil composed almost exclusively of pedagogic elements.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The academy inspector.\r\n\r\nEach department of France has an academy inspector appointed by the\r\nminister. The duties of the academy inspector embrace both higher and\r\nprimary education. In the latter sphere he is the real head of the local\r\nadministration, and the primary inspectors are his subordinate officers.\r\nHe appoints the probationer-teachers and nominates the regular teachers\r\nfor appointment by the _prefet_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Prefet and conseil departemental.\r\n\r\nThe _prefet_, the chief administrative officer of each department, not\r\nonly appoints the teachers upon the proposition of the academy\r\ninspector, he is also as president of the _conseil departemental_\r\nconcerned generally with the externa of school administration, including\r\nthe supply of schools. The _conseil departemental_ with respect to its\r\npowers corresponds in some degree to our own local education\r\nauthorities, but as regards its constitution it is in no sense a\r\nmunicipal body, the representatives of the _conseil general_ of the\r\ndepartment (which corresponds to the county council) being greatly\r\noutnumbered by the pedagogical members.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Primary inspectors.\r\n\r\nThe inspectors of primary schools, as has already been stated, act under\r\nthe academy inspector. They are appointed upon the result of examination\r\nand not by direct nomination as in England. The examination is severe,\r\nand it is from the body of the professors of the normal schools rather\r\nthan from the ranks of the primary teachers that the successful\r\ncandidates are chiefly drawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Minor local authorities.\r\n\r\nVery limited powers are entrusted to certain communal and cantonal\r\nauthorities. The _commission scolaire_ is a committee organized in each\r\ncommune for the purpose of improving school attendance, to which end\r\nthey administer a _caisse des ecoles_ or school fund for supplying\r\nclothing and meals to needy children. The _maire_ of the commune has the\r\nright of visiting the schools, but neither he nor any of the minor local\r\nauthorities can interfere with the teaching. Similar duties are assigned\r\nto the _delegues cantonaux_, who are appointed by the _conseil\r\ndepartemental_ for each canton (a wider area than the commune), and can\r\nbest be described as local visitors or visiting committees rather than\r\nmanagers in our sense of the word. \"All this hierarchy of central and\r\nlocal officials,\" says Mr Brereton, \"will doubtless seem complicated to\r\nEnglish minds. The extraordinary thing is that, so far as I could learn,\r\nthe machine, for all its complexity, works smoothly enough. The truth is\r\nthat the province of each particular functionary is so clearly defined\r\nthat there is no debateable ground over which ambitious rival\r\nauthorities can wrangle.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  Conception of secondary education.\r\n\r\nIn proceeding to sketch the French system of higher primary and\r\nsecondary schools, it may be observed that European systems of higher\r\neducation have generally been framed upon the view that the divisions of\r\neducation are longitudinal, not latitudinal, and that secondary\r\neducation is a training complete in itself from the preparatory stage to\r\nthe university, with aims and ideals of general culture which\r\ndifferentiate it radically and at the very outset from education of the\r\nelementary type. On the other hand, in the United States the view has\r\nprevailed that the divisions of education must be latitudinal, that the\r\nsecondary school must be complementary to the elementary school, in\r\nwhich even the elite must receive their preparatory or elementary\r\ntraining. At any rate down to the reform of 1902, which will presently\r\nbe explained, the French system could be regarded as a typical and even\r\nextreme example of the European theory, little consistent as this might\r\nseem to be with the broader principles of democracy. This view of the\r\nmatter is expressed by the French terminology, by which what in England\r\nis called \"elementary\" is in France termed \"primary\" education.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Higher primary schools.\r\n\r\nThe thoroughness with which the principle of the autonomous character of\r\nthe two divisions of education was carried out undoubtedly favoured in a\r\nspecial degree the complete organization given to higher primary\r\ninstruction in the _ecoles primaires superieures_ under the Third\r\nRepublic. The aim of these schools is to fill the void which must\r\notherwise exist for those who need a higher education than the primary\r\nschool can give, but for whose subsequent careers secondary education\r\nwould be ill-adapted and injudicious. Throughout the organization of\r\nprimary education the French have kept steadily in view the danger of\r\ncreating an intellectual proletariate. \"Nous poursuivons la culture\r\ngenerale du caractere et de l'esprit, mais nous cherchons en meme temps\r\na orienter l'enfant vers la vie pratique,\" says an official report. The\r\naim of the higher primary school is to continue education in this\r\nspirit up to the age of sixteen so as to prepare the scholar to take an\r\nhonourable place in the higher ranks of skilled industry rather than to\r\ndeflect him towards a professional career or intellectual pursuits for\r\nwhich he is unfitted, not so much by the accidents of birth and social\r\ncircumstance as by his own natural aptitudes. Within the limits\r\nnecessarily marked out for them the higher primary schools of France\r\nhave aimed at imparting what may be termed a general culture as distinct\r\nfrom purely technical or trade teaching, and this development has been\r\ngreatly furthered by the separate organization given to the latter\r\nteaching in the _ecoles professionnelles_. At the same time, prominence\r\nis given in the higher primary schools to practical training of an\r\neducational character with special reference to the industries and\r\ncircumstances of the locality, and in the rural districts a special\r\nagricultural bias is imparted to the curriculum. It is interesting to\r\nnote that the institution of the higher primary schools was due in large\r\npart to the spontaneous initiative of the municipalities, and that in\r\nthe later phases of state organization special care has been taken to\r\navoid anything in the nature of a rigid uniformity in these schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Supplementary courses.\r\n\r\nA wider extension has been given to higher primary instruction by the\r\nestablishment of _cours complementaires_ in certain schools, at centres\r\nat which it would be impossible to organize separate higher primary\r\nschools. A similar solution of the continuation school problem has\r\nrecently commended itself to the consultative committee of the Board of\r\nEducation for England.\r\n\r\nAdmission to the higher primary schools in France is only accorded to\r\nthose who have obtained the elementary school leaving certificate,\r\n_certificat d'etudes primaires_. A feature of importance for\r\ncontinuation work in rural districts is the provision made for boarding\r\nscholars in attendance at these schools. The boarding arrangements are\r\ngenerally, as in the case of the secondary schools, left to the head\r\nteacher, but in some instances municipal hostels have been provided. No\r\nfees may be charged for higher primary instruction, and scholarships\r\n(_bourses_) are provided to a certain extent in the form either of\r\nboarding scholarships or maintenance allowances to compensate the parent\r\nfor the loss of the child's labour. The number of scholars in the public\r\nhigher primary schools for the year 1903-1904 was 34,084, and in _cours\r\ncomplementaires_ 21,777, making a total of 55,861. In addition there\r\nwere 8891 scholars in receipt of higher primary instruction in private\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Secondary schools, lycees and colleges.\r\n\r\nFrench secondary education is given in the _lycees_ which are\r\nfirst-grade schools maintained and controlled by the state, and the\r\n_colleges_, which are schools of the second grade maintained partly by\r\nthe state and partly by the municipality. A considerable number of\r\nscholars pass annually from the colleges to the lycees. In both grades\r\nof schools the teachers are paid by the state and nominated directly or\r\nindirectly by the minister of education. They are required to possess\r\ncertain specified academic qualifications which can only be obtained\r\nfrom the _universite_, but failing teachers with the prescribed\r\nqualifications the classes are taught by teachers styled _charges de\r\ncours_ as distinct from professors.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ecole Normale Superieure.\r\n\r\nWith a view to supplying teachers for the secondary schools, the state\r\nmaintains the Ecole Normale Superieure, a college in which instruction,\r\nboard and lodging are given free to a number of scholars selected by\r\ncompetition from the best secondary school boys, though residence in the\r\ninstitution is no longer compulsory. By the decrees of November 10,\r\n1903, and May 10, 1904, the Ecole Normale became practically the College\r\nof Pedagogy of the University of Paris. Its students are entered as\r\nstudents of the university, and study for their qualifying examination\r\nas teachers in secondary schools (_agregation_) under university\r\nprofessors, partly at the Sorbonne, partly at the Ecole Normale, while\r\ntheir professional preparation is entrusted solely to the latter\r\ninstitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Classical and modern education. Reform of 1902.\r\n\r\nThe Republic has not reorganized secondary education by a comprehensive\r\nlaw; it has, however, introduced by decree, under parliamentary\r\nauthority, an important reform in the internal organization of the\r\nschools which marks a notable departure from the traditional view of\r\nsecondary education as a self-contained whole. Article 1 of the decree\r\nof May 31, 1902, declares that secondary education is co-ordinated with\r\nprimary education in such a way as to constitute a continuation of a\r\ncourse of primary studies of a normal duration of four years. The decree\r\ngoes on to provide for a full course of secondary studies of seven\r\nyears' duration, divided into two cycles of four and three years\r\nrespectively. In the first cycle the scholar has two options. In section\r\n1 Latin is obligatory and Greek optional from the beginning of the third\r\nyear (_classe iv._). In section 2 there is no Latin. At the end of the\r\nfirst cycle the state grants a _certificat d'etudes secondaires du\r\npremier degre_. In the second cycle one of four courses may be taken;\r\nsection 1 with Latin and Greek continues the old classical education;\r\nsection 2 with Latin and modern languages corresponds to the German\r\nRealgymnasium; section 3 with Latin and science, and section 4 with\r\nmodern languages and science, to the Oberrealschule. The _baccalaureat_,\r\nor secondary school-leaving examination, conducted by the university, is\r\nadapted to all the courses on the principle that courses of study of\r\nequal length, whether classical or modern, literary or scientific, are\r\nentitled to equal advantages. This system of alternative courses with\r\nleaving examinations of equal value is mainly German in origin, and may\r\nbe said to represent the results of the best European thought upon the\r\nproblem of the organization of secondary education.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Religious instruction in lycees.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable in view of the thoroughness with which the principle of\r\nlaicization has been applied to the primary schools that the lycees\r\nstill retain their chaplains (_aumoniers_) for the purpose of giving\r\nreligious instruction. This difference of treatment is apparently based\r\nupon the consideration that the gratuitous and compulsory character of\r\nprimary education demanded a much stricter interpretation of the\r\nprinciple of the neutrality of the state than was necessary in the case\r\nof secondary education, which is neither compulsory nor gratuitous.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Private secondary schools.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the state schools there have until lately been in France\r\na large number of private secondary schools, the most important of which\r\nhave been associated with the Catholic religious orders. The enforcement\r\nof the laws against these communities has resulted in the closure of a\r\nnumber of these schools, and in the reorganization of others under a lay\r\nteaching staff. It is conceivable that the action of the Republic may\r\nlargely forward the movement, otherwise perceptible in the Roman\r\nCatholic Church, to transfer education, even when combined with specific\r\nreligious teaching, from ecclesiastical to lay hands. Evidence of this\r\ntendency is to be found in the boarding-schools (some four in number)\r\nfounded upon the plan of M. Demolins (author of _A quoi tient la\r\nsuperiorite des Anglo-Saxons_) after the English public school model,\r\nbut with a distinctly Catholic colouring.\r\n\r\nApart from the position of the religious orders, the future of private\r\neducation in France is far from secure at the present time. The liberty\r\nof teaching secured by the _Loi Falloux_ is regarded as a pseudo-liberty\r\nby the advanced republican educationists, and the principle that\r\neducation is a function of the state and not a matter of supply and\r\ndemand is deeply rooted in the public mind. Proposals have been mooted\r\nfor making the baccalaureat strictly a school leaving examination\r\nattached to the state schools. The adoption of any such measure would\r\npractically destroy liberty of teaching by reason of the power which the\r\nbaccalaureat secures to the state as the key to the professions.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Secondary education for girls.\r\n\r\nThe foundation of secondary schools for girls in connexion with the\r\neducational reform of Jules Ferry is in its way one of the most notable\r\nachievements of the republic. There is little doubt that the expulsion\r\nof the religious orders is destined to exercise a profound influence\r\nupon the education of women in France. The place of the closed convent\r\nschools is being taken either by new state schools or by Catholic\r\nschools under lay teachers, and the number of scholars affected by this\r\nprocess of laicization is far larger in the case of girls than of boys.\r\nThis change is calculated to produce far-reaching effects in the social\r\nand religious order, by no means necessarily, however, of an\r\nanti-Catholic or irreligious kind.\r\n\r\nFor an account of the resuscitation by the Republic of the local\r\nuniversities under the one great state teaching body collectively known\r\nas the University, see UNIVERSITIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Germany._\r\n\r\nUnder the German empire education is left to the exclusive control of\r\neach of the federated states. The only point of direct contact between\r\nthe Empire and education lies in the mutual undertaking of the federated\r\nstates to bring the law of compulsory school attendance to bear upon all\r\nsubjects of the empire resident within their respective borders. Of far\r\ngreater moment is the moral influence exerted upon the other states by\r\nthe Prussian hegemony, in virtue of which the Prussian educational\r\nsystem comes to be in all essential characteristics typical and\r\nrepresentative of Germany as a whole. It is remarkable that though, as\r\nMatthew Arnold was able to report to the Schools Inquiry Commission in\r\n1866, \"the school system of Germany in its completeness and carefulness\r\nis such as to excite the foreigner's admiration,\" neither Prussia\r\nherself, nor Bavaria, nor several other of the principal states of the\r\nEmpire, have found it practicable to pass a comprehensive education law,\r\nowing to the religious and political difficulties with which any general\r\nlegislative assertion of principle is attended in Germany as in England.\r\nThe consequence is that the Prussian system in particular is the result\r\nof a long and complicated series of special laws, decrees and\r\nadministrative regulations. In such circumstances it is inevitable that,\r\nespecially in secondary education, some considerable local variations\r\nand anomalies should remain, but the centralized authority of the state\r\nhas confined these to questions of patronage and external\r\nadministration, and even within this sphere has successfully asserted\r\nits own ultimate supremacy as the guardian of the educational interests\r\nof its citizens. A detailed historical study would bring out clearly the\r\nintimate connexion between the development of the educational system and\r\nthe growth of the Prussian state, and again between these and the\r\nexpansion of the national life of the German people; incidentally it\r\nwould exhibit the supremacy of Prussia in the modern Empire as the\r\ninevitable result not merely of military force but of a genuine hegemony\r\nof intellect and culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Influence of Luther.\r\n\r\nStress is rightly laid by all educational writers upon Luther's famous\r\nletter to the German municipalities in 1524, urging upon them the duty\r\nof providing schools and upon parents the duty of sending their children\r\nto school. An attempt to give effect to this teaching was at once made\r\nby the electoral government of Saxony, which by a school ordinance of\r\n1528 provided for the establishment in every town and village of Latin\r\nschools, for in Germany as in England the influence of the Protestant\r\nreformers was solidly on the side of classical education as the key to\r\nthe study of the Scriptures and theological learning. All the more\r\nremarkable, therefore, was the initiative of the electorate of\r\nWurttemberg, whose school ordinance of 1559 represents the first\r\nsystematic attempt to make provision for both elementary and higher\r\neducation, directing that elementary schools should be set up throughout\r\nthe country, and _Particularschulen_ or Latin schools in every\r\nconsiderable centre of population. The educational efforts both of the\r\nearly Reformers and of the remarkable Jesuit educationists, who\r\ncontributed so largely to the partial reconquest of south Germany for\r\nthe Catholic Church, were brought to naught amid the troublous times of\r\nthe Thirty Years' War, and the desolation and national decadence which\r\nthat calamity brought in its train. To this result the aridity of the\r\nProtestant scholastics who succeeded Luther and Melanchthon, and the\r\nfrivolity, incompetence and petty despotism of the small German courts,\r\ncontributed in no slight measure. The permanent and positive value of\r\nLuther's pronouncement of 1524 consists not so much in the direct\r\neffects which it produced as in the hallowed association which it\r\nestablished for Protestant Germany between the national religion and the\r\neducational duties of the individual and the state, and doubtless this\r\nassociation largely contributed to the creation of that healthy public\r\nopinion which in Prussia rendered the principle of compulsory school\r\nattendance easy of acceptance at a much earlier date than in England and\r\nelsewhere, save only Scotland, where a similar historical religious\r\ninfluence was supplied by John Knox.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Early Prussian measures.\r\n\r\nState interference in education is almost coincident with the rise of\r\nthe Prussian state. Already in 1717 Frederick William I. ordered all\r\nchildren to attend school where schools existed, and fixed the fee at 5\r\npf. (1/2d.) a week. This was followed in 1736 by edicts for the\r\nestablishment of schools in certain provinces and by a royal grant of\r\n50,000 thalers for that purpose in the following year. In 1763 the\r\n_General Landschulreglement_ of Frederick the Great laid down the broad\r\nlines upon which the Prussian state has since proceeded, asserting the\r\nprinciple of compulsory school attendance, fixing the fees, with\r\nprovision for the assistance of very poor children, prescribing the\r\ncourse of instruction, and giving directions for the examination and\r\nsupervision of teachers. Much progress was made, more especially in the\r\norganization of higher education, under Baron von Zedlitz, who was\r\nappointed minister for Lutheran church and school affairs by Frederick\r\nthe Great in 1771, and retired under Frederick William II. in 1788. The\r\nlast-mentioned year saw the establishment of the _Abiturientenexamen_,\r\nor leaving examinations, which form the determining element in the state\r\norganization of secondary education in Germany. As in England, the fear\r\nof the French Revolution produced a corresponding reaction in\r\neducational affairs, and the policy of Frederick William II. was to bind\r\never closer school and church in a system practically independent of\r\nstate control. The first departure from this policy was marked by the\r\n_Allgemeines Landrecht_ of 1794, which boldly proclaims that schools and\r\neducational institutions may be founded only with the knowledge and\r\nconsent of the state, and must always be under its supervision and\r\nsubject to its examination and control. This law also laid upon heads of\r\nfamilies in every place the duty of providing and maintaining schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Reconstruction after Jena.\r\n\r\nIt was not till the disaster of Jena and the prostration of Prussia at\r\nthe feet of Napoleon awoke the dormant spirit of patriotism, and\r\nconcentrated all the intellectual forces of north Germany upon the task\r\nof national regeneration, that the principles of the _Allgemeines\r\nLandrecht_ of 1794 bore full fruit. \"The organization of the Prussian\r\nschool system,\" says Dr James E. Russell in his work on _German Higher\r\nSchools_, \"waited on the reorganization of the Prussian State.\" One of\r\nthe first acts of the great patriotic minister von Stein, upon his\r\nassuming control of the civil administration in 1807, was to abolish the\r\nsemi-ecclesiastical Oberschulkollegium which had been set up as the\r\ncentral authority under the churchly policy of Frederick William II.,\r\nand to place education under the Ministry of the Interior as a special\r\nsection. Wilhelm von Humboldt was placed at the head of this section in\r\n1809, and the work which this \"great master of the science and art of\r\neducation\" (as Professor Seeley terms him in his _Life of Stein_)\r\ninaugurated in his one year of office entitles him to be ranked among\r\nthe founders of German unity. Humboldt's greatest positive\r\nachievements--the foundation of the university of Berlin and its\r\norganization under a professorial staff which included Fichte,\r\nSchleiermacher, Savigny, Wolf and Niebuhr, as also the internal reform\r\nof secondary schools undertaken with the pedagogical assistance of Wolf\r\nand under the inspiration of Fichte--lie beyond the scope of this\r\narticle. It may, however, be observed that Humboldt's policy in\r\nsecondary education represents a compromise between the narrow\r\nphilological pedantry of the old Latin schools and the large demands of\r\nthe new humanism of the period; and the recent reform of the Prussian\r\nsecondary schools may be said to represent a return to the spirit of\r\nHumboldt in this respect. The measure introduced by Humboldt in 1810 for\r\nthe state examination and certification of teachers checked the then\r\ncommon practice of permitting unqualified theological students to teach\r\nin the schools, and at once raised the teaching profession to a high\r\nlevel of dignity and efficiency which of itself sufficed to place\r\nPrussia in the forefront of educational progress. It was due also to\r\nthe initiative of Humboldt that the methods of Pestalozzi were\r\nintroduced into the teachers' seminaries, through them to vitalize the\r\nelementary schools. To the period of the national struggle belong the\r\nrevival in 1812 of the Abiturientenexamen which had fallen into\r\nabeyance, and the institution about the same time of the local\r\nauthorities called _Schulvorstande_ for the country and\r\n_Schuldeputationen_ for the towns.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Reforms of 1825 and 1834. Abiturientenexamen.\r\n\r\nThough the period which succeeded the peace of 1815 was one of political\r\nreaction, the cabinet order of Frederick William III. in 1825\r\nstrengthened the law of compulsory attendance and carried on the work of\r\nadministrative organization by defining the duties of the\r\nProvinzial-Schul-Kollegium and the Regierung. In 1834 an important\r\ndevelopment was given to secondary education by making it necessary for\r\ncandidates for the learned professions as well as for the civil service,\r\nand for university studies, to have passed the leaving examination of\r\nthe gymnasia. Thus through the leaving examination the state holds the\r\nkey to the liberal careers, and has thereby been able to impose its own\r\nstandard upon all secondary schools. Apart from the privileges relative\r\nto professional studies, the system of leaving examinations has exerted\r\na wide influence upon popular education in connexion with the\r\ninstitution of compulsory military service, in virtue of a regulation\r\nwhich entitles those who pass the leaving examination of any of the\r\nrecognized kinds of secondary schools to the much-coveted privilege of\r\nservice for one year as a \"volunteer\" instead of two years as an\r\nordinary conscript.\r\n\r\nThe revolutionary and national movement of 1848 was followed by a period\r\nof further educational activity. The Act of Constitution of 1850\r\ndeclared teachers civil servants and elementary education free. In\r\npractice, the abolition of school fees did not become general until\r\n1888. Since then the view has more and more prevailed that elementary\r\neducation must be free,[2] and, broadly speaking, fees in elementary\r\nschools are now charged only for children attending from another school\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Kulturkampf and the confessional system.\r\n\r\nIn connexion with the _Kulturkampf_, or struggle between the state and\r\nthe Roman Catholic Church, the _Schulaufsichtsgesetz_ of 1872 reasserted\r\nthe absolute right of the state alone to the supervision of the schools;\r\nbut the severity of this law as a measure against Roman Catholic\r\nclerical education was considerably modified as a result of the\r\nsubsequent reconciliation with the papacy under Leo XIII., and the\r\nPrussian system remains to-day both for Catholics and Protestants\r\nessentially denominational. All schools, whether elementary or\r\nsecondary, are Evangelical, Catholic, Jewish or mixed. In the elementary\r\nsphere, in particular, recourse is only had to the mixed school\r\n(_Simultanschule_ or _paritatische Schule_), where the creeds are so\r\nintermingled that a confessional school is impracticable. In all cases\r\nthe teachers are appointed with reference to religious faith; religious\r\ninstruction is given compulsorily in school hours and is inspected by\r\nthe clergy. The general purport of the Prussian school law of 1906 is to\r\nstrengthen the system of separate confessional schools, which it extends\r\nto certain provinces where it had not previously been in operation.\r\n\r\nIn financial respects the last-mentioned law effected some readjustment\r\nof burdens by charging a proportion of the expenditure upon landed\r\nproperty. Other recent changes relate to the reform of secondary\r\neducation referred to below. The system of educational administration as\r\nit stood in 1909 may shortly be described as follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Administrative machinery.\r\n\r\nUnder the ministerium in Berlin stands the Provinzial-Schul-Kollegium,\r\nthe chairman of which is the _Ober-Prasident_ of the province, composed\r\nof four or five _Rate_ or councillors, generally selected from the\r\ndirectors of training colleges and gymnasia. This body is concerned\r\nmainly with higher education.\r\n\r\nEach province is divided for purposes of general administration into two\r\n_Regierungen_ or governments, and in each Regierung there is a section\r\nof usually three or four Schulrate, which controls the elementary\r\nschools. This council is usually recruited from the ranks of directors\r\nof training colleges and from the inspectorate. The Regierung is divided\r\ninto _Kreise_ or districts, and in each district an administrative\r\nofficer, called the _Landrat_, represents the government. The Landrat is\r\nconcerned with the provision and repair of elementary school buildings;\r\nas regards internal organization, the elementary schools are under the\r\nKreisschulinspektor.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Inspection.\r\n\r\nIn the Protestant districts the inspectors (_Kreisschulinspektoren_) are\r\nusually Evangelical clergymen holding the position of superintendent in\r\nthe Lutheran Church. In the Catholic and certain other exceptional\r\ndistricts inspectors with pedagogical qualifications and the status of\r\nfull government inspectors are appointed. Every candidate for Lutheran\r\nordination is required to spend six months at a training college, but\r\npedagogical opinion is hostile to the system, which must be regarded as\r\na survival of the traditional union of church and state in educational\r\naffairs, retained at the present day from motives of economy and a\r\ndesire to conciliate the church.\r\n\r\nFor every school there is an _Ortsschulinspektor_, usually the clergyman\r\nof the parish, who discharges the duties of local manager and\r\ncorrespondent. This local inspector is also chairman of the\r\n_Schulvorstand_ or committee, elected by the _Schulgemeinde_, and\r\ncharged with questions of attendance and maintenance rather than with\r\ninternal affairs. The Schulgemeinde need not coincide with the civil\r\nparish. Parishes may unite to provide one school, or within one parish\r\ndifferent religious communities may form separate school \"parishes.\"\r\n\r\nThus the administrative system of Prussia in education as in other\r\nmatters may be described in general as a decentralized bureaucracy. This\r\nbureaucracy is somewhat checked by the rights of patronage attaching to\r\nthe local boards in certain cases, but the exercise of such rights is in\r\nall cases subject to government approval. As regards higher-grade\r\nelementary and secondary schools, the local boards in the towns\r\n(_Schuldeputationen_) are able to exert a considerable influence in the\r\nway of selection of the type of school, and even of suggestion for the\r\nmodification of recognized types, as is shown by the cases of the famous\r\n\"reformed\" secondary curricula of Altona and Frankfort. Still, the legal\r\npowers of the local board are restricted to the establishment of an\r\napproved type of school, the control of externa, and the right of\r\nnominating teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Peculiarities of elementary education.\r\n\r\n_Elementary Schools._--The single-class school (_Einklassige Schule_)\r\nand the half-day school (_Halbtagsschule_) are features of the Prussian\r\nelementary system which require notice. The Einklassige Schule is a\r\nschool taught by a single teacher, who may teach a maximum number of\r\neighty children. The Halbtagsschule is a single-class school of which\r\nhalf the children are taught in the morning and half in the afternoon.\r\nDuring the summer months, owing to the exigencies of agricultural\r\nlabour, many single-class schools are taught as half-day schools. The\r\nsystem of course is regarded as a makeshift, but in this, as in the\r\nmatter of buildings for rural elementary schools, the Prussian\r\nadministration attaches great weight to the consideration of financial\r\neconomy. As regards staff, a large measure of economy is rendered\r\npossible by the high average standard of merit reached by German\r\nelementary teachers, whose powers of oral exposition have struck English\r\nobservers as specially remarkable, and again by the national readiness\r\nto be content with a moderate salary in return for official status. A\r\nsurvival of the old close connexion between church and school is to be\r\nfound in the _Kirchendienste_, the duties of training the choir, playing\r\nthe organ, &c., which are attached in many cases to the post of\r\nschoolmaster, and afford an additional source of emolument, rendered\r\nfeasible by the practical absence of religious dissent.\r\n\r\nFor the preliminary training of elementary teachers there are special\r\nschools called _Praparanden-Anstalten_, of which most are state\r\ninstitutions, some are municipal, and a few are private. The training\r\ncolleges themselves are provided by the state and have a three years'\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Continuative education.\r\n\r\n_Continuation Schools (Fortbildungsschulen)._--Germans have been\r\nforemost to realize the truth which is gradually being brought home to\r\nEnglish educationists, that adequate value for the heavy expenditure of\r\npublic funds upon education can only be obtained by providing for the\r\ncontinued education for two or three years of the children of the\r\nworking classes who leave school at fourteen years of age. One of the\r\neducational results of the war of 1870, with its great lesson of the\r\nimportance of national education, was the Saxon law of 1873 making\r\nattendance at continuation schools compulsory for three years (i.e. up\r\nto seventeen) in that kingdom: The Saxon law appears to have been\r\njustified by the experience of nearly a generation. It must suffice here\r\nto note the following features of its working. (1) The schools are\r\ntaught by the primary teachers, supplemented in the towns by some\r\ntechnical instructors. (2) The school session may be either for the\r\nwhole year or for only half the year, and may also be held on Sunday,\r\nlike the old English secular Sunday schools. (3) The schools are brought\r\ninto close relation with trades, not only for purposes of curriculum,\r\nbut also with a view to considering the exigencies and meeting the\r\nconvenience of employers with respect to hours of attendance. (4) The\r\ndiscipline of the continuation school is extended to supervision out of\r\nschool hours. \"Visits to dancing-halls and all such exhibitions as are\r\ndangerous to uprightness and purity are forbidden to scholars of\r\ncontinuation schools.\" Further, useful institutions such as savings\r\nbanks, and also associations for social intercourse and the promotion of\r\n_esprit de corps_, are organized in connexion with continuation schools.\r\nThere is no doubt that in this matter of continuation schools, as in so\r\nmany other fields of social organization, the adoption of compulsion has\r\nbeen facilitated by the habituation of the working classes to compulsory\r\nmilitary service, which has made the German workman more disciplined,\r\nmore \"organizable\" as a social unit, more accustomed to subordinate the\r\nprinciple of individual freedom and self-will to the collective claims\r\nof the state, than the workman reared in the traditions of Anglo-Saxon\r\nindividualism.\r\n\r\nAttendance at continuation schools is now compulsory by state law in 12\r\nstates, including (besides Saxony) Baden, Wurttemberg and Bavaria. The\r\ncity of Munich is notable for its highly organized system of technical\r\ncontinuation schools for apprentices. In Prussia compulsory attendance\r\nis still the exception (save in the provinces of Posen and West Prussia,\r\nwhere it is enforced by state law), but the permissive act is being\r\nrapidly adopted by the great cities, including Berlin.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Grading of secondary schools.\r\n\r\n_Secondary Education._--The official classification or grading according\r\nto the type of curriculum of secondary schools in Prussia (and indeed\r\nthroughout Germany) is very precise. The following are the officially\r\nrecognized types. I. Classical schools: (a) Gymnasium, with nine years'\r\ncourse; (b) Progymnasium, with six years' course. II. Modern schools:\r\n(a) with Latin (semi-classical)--(i.) Realgymnasium (nine years'\r\ncourse), (ii.) Realprogymnasium (six years' course); (b) without Latin\r\n(non-classical)--(i.) Oberrealschule (nine years' course), (ii.)\r\nRealschule (six years' course). The six-year classical and\r\nsemi-classical schools are comparatively unimportant subdivisions in\r\nsmaller towns.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Co-ordination of elementary and secondary education.\r\n\r\n_Lower-grade Secondary Education._--Inasmuch as French is taught in the\r\nlowest class of the Realschule under the official curriculum (English,\r\non the other hand, beginning in Tertia, the fourth class from the\r\nlowest), it follows that this, the lowest type of secondary school, is\r\nnot directly co-ordinated with the elementary school. The Realschulen of\r\nBerlin, however, form an important exception to the general rule; their\r\ncurriculum, sanctioned by the ministry at the instance of the Berlin\r\nmunicipality, provides for the beginning of French in Quarta (the third\r\nclass from the bottom) and English in Secunda. The consequence is that\r\nin Berlin a very large number of pupils pass from the elementary schools\r\nto the Realschulen, which take the place of the Mittelschulen or\r\nhigher-grade elementary schools that are to be found in some towns,\r\nthough something in the nature of higher elementary education is\r\nafforded by the top sections of the elementary schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n  First grade secondary schools.\r\n\r\n_First-grade Schools._--One of the most striking features of German\r\nsecondary education is the careful differentiation of schools according\r\nto the type of curriculum adopted. Thus, every German school is a\r\nhomogeneous unit with a definite educational aim and organization,\r\nconforming to a common standard approved by public authority for the\r\nparticular type to which it belongs. Hence the importance attached by\r\nthe Germans to nomenclature; so that in selecting a Gymnasium, a\r\nRealgymnasium or an Oberrealschule, the parent knows exactly the type of\r\neducation he is going to secure for his son. In England, on the other\r\nhand, as has often been observed, a great school tends to multiply\r\nwithin itself different types of curricula in a haphazard way according\r\nto the demand of parents, whose original choice of school is based\r\nrather on social than on educational grounds. Modern sides, army classes\r\nand engineering classes grow up as excrescences upon an originally\r\nclassical type, with the waste of power that results from loss of\r\nconsistency and concentration of purpose. The difference between the\r\nEnglish and German systems is due ultimately to the adoption in Germany\r\nof the day-school system and the absence, very remarkable in an\r\notherwise aristocratically governed country, of the caste spirit in\r\neducation above the elementary level, thanks to which the nobly born are\r\nnot ashamed to sit on the school bench side by side with the children of\r\nthe trading classes. On the other hand, the English boarding-school\r\nsystem, despite all the want of social solidarity, and all the class\r\njealousy and exclusiveness with which it is inevitably associated, has\r\nadmittedly favoured those ideals of the cultivation of character as\r\ndistinct from book-learning which give a special value to what is in\r\nEngland called a public school education.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Rise of semi-classical schools.\r\n\r\nThe present differentiation of first-grade schools in Prussia is the\r\nresult of a natural educational development corresponding with the\r\neconomic changes which have transformed Prussia and the empire from an\r\nagricultural to an industrial state. It was in 1855 that semi-classical\r\nschools (teaching Latin without Greek) were first recognized for a nine\r\nyears' course under the title of Realschule I. Ordnung, and in 1871\r\npupils possessing their leaving certificates were admitted to\r\nmathematical studies in the universities. The Latinless Realschule II.\r\nOrdnung is the direct product of the great industrial development of the\r\nmodern empire. In 1882 the Realschule I. Ordnung received the title of\r\nRealgymnasium, and the Realschule II. Ordnung that of Oberrealschule,\r\nboth types being at the same time admitted to certain privileges in the\r\nuniversities, schools of technology and civil service.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The \"reform school\" movement.\r\n\r\nAbout the same period official recognition was obtained for reformed\r\nsecondary curricula, first at Altona and afterwards (1892) at Frankfort.\r\nThese two types differ from each other in detail, but the feature which\r\ndistinguishes both from the older types is the postponement of Latin to\r\nUntertertia. The design is to secure for all types of secondary\r\neducation a common non-classical base coextensive with the first three\r\nyears of school life, followed by a trifurcation or threefold choice\r\nbetween the classical, semi-classical and non-classical types. The\r\nprinciple of the \"reform-school\" has been adopted in a considerable\r\nnumber of German (chiefly Prussian) schools, but it would be premature\r\nto see in it at present more than a new variety of Realgymnasium or\r\nsemi-classical school; it can hardly be said as yet to have affected the\r\ncourse of classical studies in the full sense. The widespread sentiment\r\nof discontent with the old philological type of classical school was\r\nvigorously expressed in a private letter written by the emperor William\r\nII. as crown prince of Prussia in 1885, but not published until\r\nsome-years later. In December 1890 the Prussian ministry convoked a\r\nconference at Berlin of secondary school experts, and the emperor\r\npresided in person at the opening session. His majesty delivered a\r\nspeech criticizing the Gymnasia as wanting a national basis. \"It is our\r\nduty to educate young men to become young Germans and not young Greeks\r\nor Romans\" was the keynote of the imperial discourse. The outcome of the\r\nconference was a shortening of the hours allowed to Latin in the\r\nGymnasia, a reduction of the hours of study in view of over-pressure,\r\nand an expression of official opinion adverse to the Realgymnasium.\r\nThese changes, introduced in 1892, did not go far enough to satisfy the\r\nreformers, whilst the reduction of the hours allowed for Latin caused\r\nmisgivings among the upholders of the traditional Gymnasium. Moreover,\r\nthe Realgymnasium showed greater vitality among the large towns than its\r\nofficial critics anticipated. The ensuing decade witnessed a certain\r\nreaction in favour of the classical humanities as a barrier against the\r\nmaterialistic influences of the new industrialism. At the same time the\r\nprotagonists of the classics came to recognize that side by side with\r\nthe old humanities there must be accorded to modern and scientific\r\nsubjects that place in the high-grade schools which the practical\r\nexigencies of industrial life demanded. Thus, the opinion grew that the\r\nbest line of defence for the classical schools lay in the concession of\r\nequal privileges to the non-classical types; in this way only could the\r\nclassical schools be kept safe from demands upon their time that could\r\nnot be conceded without endangering their proper work. It was upon this\r\nbasis that an agreement was reached between the contending parties at a\r\nsecond school conference that met in Berlin in June 1900. As the result\r\nof this conference there was issued a royal decree laying down certain\r\ngeneral principles, of which the following are the most important. (1)\r\nThere must be equality of privileges as between classical,\r\nsemi-classical and non-classical first-grade schools. The decree\r\nrecognizes, however, that this principle must be applied with a certain\r\nelasticity and with due regard to the necessity for training in\r\nparticular branches of knowledge as a preliminary to certain lines of\r\nuniversity study and certain professional pursuits. Consequently the\r\nPrussian system of privileges has become extremely complicated, and it\r\nis truer to speak, as the decree goes on to do, of an extension of the\r\nprivileges of the non-classical schools, rather than of absolute\r\nequality. (2) \"In thus acknowledging the equality of the three types of\r\nhigher institutions, it will be possible more thoroughly to strengthen\r\nthe special characteristics of each type. In this connexion,\" the royal\r\ndecree proceeds, \"I shall offer no objection to an increase in the\r\nnumber of hours devoted to Latin in the Gymnasium and Realgymnasium.\"\r\nThus, both as to the place of Latin in the curriculum of classical\r\nschools and as to the status of semi-classical schools, the decree of\r\n1900 involves a reversal of the policy of 1890. (3) The decree expresses\r\napproval of the reformed curricula of Altona and Frankfort, and a desire\r\nfor an extension of the experiment where the conditions are suitable.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the growing official encouragement of education upon\r\nsemi-classical or non-classical lines, the upper and professional\r\nclasses of Germany continue to show a marked preference for the fully\r\nclassical Gymnasium; hence, in Germany as in England, the tendency for a\r\nwidening gulf to disclose itself between the education of the directing\r\nclasses in politics and administration and the bulk of the industrial\r\npopulation, which suggests that the problem of combining in just\r\nproportions the liberal and practical elements in a thoroughly national\r\nsystem of education has not yet reached the solution that the needs of\r\nthe age require.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Switzerland._\r\n\r\n  Educational influence of federal constitution.\r\n\r\nSwitzerland affords perhaps the best type of a democratic system of\r\nlocal authorities. The central authority is the canton, not the\r\nfederation. The interference of the federal authority is confined to the\r\nimposition of certain broad principles by the constitution, to the\r\nindirect influence exerted by the examination of recruits for the\r\nnational army, and to financial grants for technical instruction, its\r\nmost important direct educational work being the support of the\r\ntechnological university at Zurich. The federal constitution (1) states\r\nthat primary instruction must be under the control of the canton (an\r\nimportant point in view of the strength of ecclesiastical influence in\r\nsome of the Catholic cantons), and must be compulsory and gratuitous;\r\n(2) declares that it must be possible for the public schools to be\r\nattended by the adherents of all creeds without hurting their freedom of\r\nconscience; (3) forbids the employment of child labour before completion\r\nof the fourteenth year, with a provision that in the fifteenth and\r\nsixteenth years factory work, together with the time given to school and\r\nreligious instruction, must not exceed eleven hours a day. (4) All\r\nrecruits for the federal army (in which service is compulsory on a\r\nmilitia basis) are examined in their twentieth year, and the results are\r\npublished. This examination affords an instructive index to the state of\r\neducation in the several cantons and promotes a healthy emulation among\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Cantonal organization.\r\n\r\nThe cantonal organization of education presents the variety which the\r\nextraordinary diversity of race, language, religion and physical\r\nconditions of the component states of the federation would lead one to\r\nexpect. The large canton of Bern may be instanced as the type of a\r\nstrong central authority. The commune or parish is the unit for\r\nelementary education. The communal council nominates a school board of\r\nat least five members, whose function is to spend the money voted for\r\nschool purposes by the general communal council. Several communes in\r\ncombination form a district authority for the support of what are in\r\nreality higher primary schools, though called in Switzerland\r\n_Sekundarschulen_, maintained by the district. The maintenance both of\r\nthe primary and higher primary schools is aided by grants from the\r\ncentral authority. The true secondary schools, called middle or higher\r\nschools, are maintained and controlled by the central or cantonal\r\nauthority. The existence of separate local authorities for each grade of\r\neducation is characteristic of Switzerland generally, this system being\r\nthe opposite to that adopted in England in 1902.\r\n\r\nThe central grants in Switzerland always take the form of payments to\r\nthe local authorities of a proportion of the teachers' salaries; they\r\nare never, as in England, assessed upon the number of children in\r\nattendance, nor are they dependent, as was formerly the case in England,\r\nupon the results of examination, nor again are grants made in respect of\r\nparticular subjects as is the case with the grants for special, i.e.\r\npractical, instruction in England.\r\n\r\nReligious instruction in the Swiss communal schools generally follows\r\nthe faith of the majority; in a few cantons separate schools being\r\nprovided for minorities if sufficiently numerous. In the town of\r\nLucerne, Catholic instruction is given in school hours and Protestant\r\ninstruction is provided out of school and out of hours for the\r\nProtestant minority.\r\n\r\nIn 19 out of the 25 cantons attendance at continuation schools is\r\ncompulsory (at least in some districts) for boys up to 17, and in 3\r\ncantons it is compulsory also wholly or in part for girls.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Belgium._\r\n\r\n  Belgian treatment of religious question.\r\n\r\nThe interesting feature in Belgian education is the treatment of the\r\nreligious question in successive laws.\r\n\r\n1. The law of 1842 obliged the communes to provide primary instruction,\r\nwhich was to be free in the case of poor children. The state made grants\r\nin aid, subject to inspection. Subject to a conscience clause, religious\r\ninstruction was obligatory, and was placed under ecclesiastical\r\ninspection.\r\n\r\n2. The law of 1879 removed religious instruction from the curriculum,\r\nand provided for facilities to the clergy to give such instruction\r\noutside school hours. This law furnishes a striking instance of the\r\nfutility of a parliamentary majority legislating in a sense opposed to\r\nthe convictions of a considerable section of the community. The law\r\nevoked a storm of opposition in the country, still profoundly Catholic\r\nand attached to ecclesiastical traditions, and within eighteen months\r\nthe Catholics founded private elementary schools with 455,000 scholars.\r\nIn 1883 the Catholic private schools numbered 622,000 scholars, whilst\r\nthe attendance at the communal schools had sunk to 324,000. Their\r\ndoctrinaire treatment of the education question resulted in the\r\npolitical annihilation of the Belgian Liberals, and was responsible for\r\nthe strongest and most persistent Roman Catholic reaction that has been\r\nwitnessed in western Europe since the beginning of the 19th century.\r\n\r\n3. The law of 1884 was the work of the moderate Catholic party. It did\r\nnot make religious instruction obligatory, but it gave liberty to the\r\ncommunes to provide for the giving of religious and moral instruction at\r\nthe beginning or end of school hours, subject to a conscience clause.\r\nPower was given to the communes to \"adopt\" private confessional schools\r\nand maintain them. Provision was further made entitling any twenty\r\nparents of children of school age to demand a school of the normal\r\ncommunal type as against a proposal to adopt a confessional school.\r\nPower was also given to a like number of parents to compel the adoption\r\nof a confessional school in the case of the commune refusing to provide\r\nreligious instruction of the type demanded by them, or putting obstacles\r\nin the way of its being given by the clergy or their representatives.\r\n\r\n4. The law of 1895 is the work of the more authoritarian Catholics, and\r\nmakes religious instruction obligatory, placing it directly under the\r\ncontrol of the clergy. It also increased the subsidies to private\r\nschools. This law was passed in face of opposition from the moderate\r\nsection, who saw in it an exaltation of state authority which might be\r\nturned by opponents to the disadvantage of the religious interest. It is\r\nby no means clear that Belgium has yet attained a final solution of the\r\nreligious difficulty; the life of the present law is probably to be\r\nmeasured by that of the Catholic political majority.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Holland._\r\n\r\nThe outstanding feature of public education in Holland is the strength\r\nof the private primary schools. Under the law of 1857 secular teaching\r\nalone was provided in the primary schools at the public cost. The law of\r\n1878 allowed communes to make grants to private schools on condition of\r\ntheir becoming neutral in the matter of religion. The law of 1889\r\nallowed private denominational schools to receive government grants\r\nwhile retaining their denominational character, but forbade further\r\ngrants to such schools by the communes.\r\n\r\nIn 1905 there were 566,460 children in the public and 278,632 in the\r\nprivate schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Scotland._\r\n\r\nThe diverse religious and social conditions of the three constituent\r\nparts of the United Kingdom must necessarily cause the education problem\r\nto assume a different shape and to receive different solutions in\r\nEngland, Scotland and Ireland respectively; latterly also the special\r\nconditions obtaining in Wales have received partial recognition at the\r\nhands both of the legislature and the executive. In Scotland the\r\nconditions have been less complex than in England. The practical\r\nunanimity of the people in religious faith, which has remained\r\nundisturbed by the institutional divisions of recent times, the wider\r\ndiffusion of a sense of the value of education, the greater simplicity\r\nof life which has rendered all classes largely content to avail\r\nthemselves of the preparatory education afforded by the common school\r\nand favoured the development in the secondary sphere of day rather than\r\nboarding schools, are among the causes which have contributed to the\r\nearly building up of a national system which in some respects resembles\r\nthe continental rather than the English type.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Historical development.\r\n\r\nThe national appreciation of education is found marked already before\r\nthe Reformation in a statute of James IV. (1494) requiring all\r\nfreeholders of substance to send their heirs to school and to keep them\r\nthere until they had perfect Latin. The Reformation, asserting itself by\r\ncommon consent under one ecclesiastical form, and free from the\r\ndivisions of religious organization which tended to neutralize it as an\r\neducational force in England, put fresh life into the educational\r\naspirations of the people. As early as 1560 the Church Assembly, largely\r\nunder the influence of John Knox, put forth the _Book of Discipline_,\r\nproviding that \"every several kirk\" in a town \"of any reputation\" was to\r\nhave its Latin school, that the \"upaland\" or country parts were to have\r\na teacher of the \"first rudiments\" in every parish, and that each\r\n\"notable\" town was to have \"a college for logic, rhetoric and the\r\ntongues.\" Practical effect was later given to this scheme by an act of\r\nthe Scottish parliament in 1696, under which parish schools were set up\r\nin connexion with the Established Church of Scotland. This system was\r\nextended by an act of 1803, which made better provision for teachers'\r\nsalaries and also confirmed the position of the parish school as an\r\nadjunct of the parish church. The system of inspection and state aid\r\nintroduced in England in 1839 was made applicable to Scotland, thus\r\ngrafting upon Scotland the English system of voluntary state-aided\r\nschools. At the same period another new factor was imported into\r\nScottish education by the ecclesiastical disruption of 1843. As a result\r\nof these changes in 1861 a new act was passed which relaxed, though it\r\ndid not sever, the ties which bound the parish school to the church.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Scottish school boards and school attendance law.\r\n\r\nThe Education (Scotland) Act of 1872 set up elective school boards for\r\nparishes and boroughs, and vested in them the existing parish and burgh\r\nschools. Long prior to the act it had been the practice of the Church of\r\nScotland to allow exemption in the schools from religious instruction;\r\nconsequently in imposing a compulsory conscience clause the act did\r\nlittle more than confirm existing usage. The school boards were left\r\nfull liberty as to the religious instruction to be given in their\r\nschools, and in practice school boards universally adopt the Shorter\r\nCatechism, which is acceptable to all denominations of Presbyterians.\r\nThe act made the school boards responsible for the supply of school\r\naccommodation, and introduced compulsory attendance, for which opinion\r\nin England was not at that time ripe. By the act of 1901, the age of\r\ncompulsory attendance was raised to fourteen, with provision for\r\nexemption after twelve.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Administrative progress.\r\n\r\nThe experience of the Scottish Education Department, like that of the\r\nEnglish, has led to the gradual abandonment of individual examination as\r\nthe basis for the payment of grants. The institution of the merit\r\ncertificate is one of the features in which the Scottish system differs\r\nfrom the English. Prior to the code of 1903 the merit certificate,\r\nawarded on examination after the age of twelve, was properly described\r\nas the leaving certificate of the elementary school. Under the more\r\nrecent codes merit certificates are awarded under a system designed to\r\nencourage the transference of promising pupils at an early age to\r\nsupplementary courses or higher-grade departments. Under this system the\r\nfitness of the pupil to enter upon a course of higher studies is\r\ndetermined not solely by the results of a single examination, but by the\r\nwhole character of his work during the preceding school course.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Higher-grade schools.\r\n\r\nA notable factor historically in Scottish education was the extent to\r\nwhich the parish schools supplied their best pupils with higher or\r\nfurther education. The administrative changes last mentioned have led to\r\na remarkable development of organized higher-grade schools and\r\ndepartments. These departments have now been organized upon the lines of\r\nthe higher primary schools of France, \"to continue a stage further\"\r\n(says the report of the Scottish Education Department) \"the general\r\neducation of that considerable body of pupils who, under new conditions,\r\nmay be expected to remain at school till fifteen or sixteen.\" The\r\nfunction \"of giving something of the nature of a specialized education\r\nto pupils who will leave school at a comparatively early age\" is now\r\ndischarged by the supplementary courses.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Free education.\r\n\r\nElementary education has generally been rendered free by the fee grants\r\nunder the parliamentary vote, and by the sums accruing under the Local\r\nTaxation (Customs and Excise) Act 1890 and the Education and Local\r\nTaxation (Scotland) Act 1892.\r\n\r\nVoluntary schools are not numerous, being chiefly those of the Roman\r\nCatholic Church. The average cost of maintenance per child in average\r\nattendance in public schools (according to the official report\r\n1907-1908) was L3, 11s. 1-1/4d., of which L2, 4s. 4-1/2d. was met by\r\ngovernment grants for elementary education. In voluntary schools the\r\naverage cost of maintenance was L2, 15s. 1-3/4d., of which L2, 2s. 7d.\r\nwas met by elementary grants, including a special aid grant of 3s. per\r\nhead under the Education (Scotland) Act 1897.\r\n\r\nThe total number of children (1907-1908) in average attendance in\r\ngrant-earning schools was 712,076, and the percentage of attendances to\r\nnumbers on the register was 87.66%. As regards teaching power, 81.52% of\r\nthe male teachers and 56.71% of the female teachers in the elementary\r\nteachers had been trained in training colleges.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Education (Scotland) Act 1908.\r\n\r\nCertain miscellaneous additional powers are conferred upon school boards\r\nby the Education (Scotland) Act 1908, including powers to provide school\r\nmeals; in outlying parts, to provide means of conveyance, or pay\r\ntravelling expenses of teachers or pupils, or defray the cost of lodging\r\npupils in convenient proximity to a school; to provide for medical\r\ninspection; and as to children neglected by reason of the ill-health or\r\npoverty of the parent, to supply food, clothing and personal attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Compulsory continuation classes.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most noteworthy provision in the act of 1908 is that which\r\nenables (not obliges) school boards to make bye-laws requiring\r\nattendance at continuation classes up to the age of seventeen years.\r\nApart from compulsory attendance, the act lays upon school boards the\r\nduty of making suitable provision of continuation classes with reference\r\nto the crafts and industries practised in the district.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Secondary education.\r\n\r\nThe Scottish Education Act of 1872 distinguished certain burgh and\r\nparish schools as \"higher class public\" or secondary schools. The act of\r\n1908 deals in some detail with secondary education, modifying and\r\nstrengthening the framework in various ways, but without introducing\r\norganic changes. \"Secondary\" schools are distinguished from\r\n\"intermediate,\" the former being defined as providing at least a five\r\nyears' course; the latter as providing at least a three years' course in\r\nlanguages, mathematics, science and such other subjects as may from time\r\nto time be deemed suitable for the instruction of pupils who have\r\nreached a certain standard of attainment in elementary subjects under\r\nthe code. Intermediate and secondary schools may be provided and\r\nmaintained either by school boards or otherwise, and provision is\r\ncontained in the act for the transfer of endowed schools to the school\r\nboard. Thus secondary (as well as elementary and continuative) education\r\nis organized upon the basis of the parish or burgh; it receives,\r\nhowever, grants in aid through the agency of county (or large urban)\r\nauthorities (called district committees) constituted under schemes of\r\nthe Scottish Education Department. For the purpose of such grants in aid\r\nthe funds available under the various local taxation acts, together with\r\nparliamentary grants, other than a fee grant at the rate of 12s. per\r\nchild in average attendance, form a fund called the Education (Scotland)\r\nFund. After provision has been made for (_inter alia_) grants for\r\nuniversities, higher technical education and training colleges, the fund\r\nis allocated to the district committees according to a scheme laid\r\nbefore parliament and approved by the king in council. Out of the\r\n\"district education fund\" the school board receives (ordinarily) a sum\r\nequal to one-half of the amount by which the net cost to the school\r\nboard (after deducting income from grants made by the department and\r\nfrom fees) exceeds the amount which would be produced by such rate per\r\npound upon the district of the school board as the committee may\r\ndetermine, not being more than a rate of twopence in the pound.\r\nImportant powers are also conferred upon the district committee for\r\norganizing and aiding within their district the provision by the school\r\nboards of medical examination and supervision of school children, the\r\nsupply of bursaries for purposes of all forms of higher education, and\r\nthe provision of instruction in special subjects, such as agriculture,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ireland._\r\n\r\n  Special difficulties of Irish education.\r\n\r\nThe full development of a system of public education in Ireland has been\r\nhampered and retarded by the general difficulties inherent in the\r\nproblem of Irish government. In consequence of the fundamentally\r\ndifferent social, religious and political conditions in the two\r\ncountries, the English and Irish systems have developed down to the\r\npresent time upon divergent lines. In England, popular education was\r\nfounded in the first instance upon individual initiative combining in\r\norganized voluntary effort, and, though the voluntary agencies have been\r\nfirst supplemented and latterly to a large extent supplanted by public\r\naction, the tendency has been in the direction of municipalization\r\nrather than in that of central state control. In Ireland, on the other\r\nhand, education has suffered in the past from the general absence of\r\nindividual initiative and local interest almost as seriously as from the\r\nmistakes of the English government. These causes, more directly perhaps\r\nthan the prevailing poverty of the country, made it necessary to throw\r\nthe burden of supporting the schools to an increasing extent upon the\r\nstate, while the want of local self-government precluded any devolution\r\nof powers and duties upon municipal authorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Historic retrospect.\r\n\r\nState intervention is actually of earlier date in Ireland than in\r\nEngland. From the reign of Elizabeth onwards, English Protestant schools\r\nwere founded by the government in a sporadic and intermittent fashion in\r\npursuance of its Anglicizing policy. To mention briefly one or two\r\nhistorical features, the great religious educational enterprise of\r\nEdmond Rice in founding the well-known Irish Catholic order of the\r\nChristian Brothers in 1802 forms an exception to the general lack of\r\ninitiative among the people themselves. About the same period the\r\nKildare Place Society (founded in 1811 while the first commission of\r\ninquiry into Irish education was sitting) attempted to grapple with the\r\npeculiar difficulties of the religious situation upon lines somewhat\r\nsimilar to those just laid down by Lancaster and his followers in\r\nEngland. This organization comprised both Roman Catholic and Protestant\r\nschools upon a common religious basis of Bible reading without note or\r\ncomment, and received government grants which rose to L30,000 a year\r\nbefore they were discontinued in 1833. The religious compromise which\r\nthe system embodied broke down in consequence of Catholic\r\ndissatisfaction, and that it was at first fairly successful may seem\r\nextraordinary in view of the later attitude of the Catholic Church\r\ntowards the question of common schools and combined religious\r\ninstruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The national system.\r\n\r\nIn 1833, as the result of a second commission of inquiry (1824) and a\r\nselect committee of the House of Commons (1828), Mr Stanley inaugurated\r\nthe national system of elementary schools under a board of commissioners\r\nnominated from the different religious denominations. The government\r\nappears from the outset to have aimed at combined secular and separate\r\nreligious instruction for Roman Catholics and Protestants. At the same\r\ntime, an attempt was inconsistently made to provide an ethical basis for\r\nthe secular instruction by means of Bible extracts. The story of the\r\npreparation of these extracts by an ingenious compound of the Protestant\r\nAuthorized and Douai versions of Scripture is in its way one of the\r\ncuriosities of religious history. The extracts were designed to meet the\r\nrecognized Catholic objection to the indiscriminate reading of the Bible\r\nwithout note or comment. In practice they were chiefly used in the\r\nProtestant schools (in which their use is now practically extinct), and\r\nthe growing Catholic objection to the policy of the National Board in\r\nthis respect found authoritative, though somewhat cautiously worded,\r\nexpression in a decree of the Roman Congregation De Propaganda Fide of\r\nJanuary 11, 1846, declaring that non-sectarian religious instruction was\r\ndangerous to youth. \"Tutius multo esse ut literarum tantummodo humanarum\r\nmagisterium fiat in scholis promiscuis, quam ut fundamentales, ut aiunt,\r\net communes religionis Christianae articuli restricte tradantur,\r\nreservata singulis sestis peculiari seorsum eruditione. Ita enim cum\r\npueris agere periculosum valde videtur.\" The religious difficulty in\r\nIrish elementary education may be said to have been solved in process of\r\ntime by the conversion of the national system in practice, though not in\r\ntheory, into a system strongly denominational and therefore widely\r\ndifferent from the design of its founders, combined Biblical instruction\r\nbeing discarded, and separate schools for the most part taking the place\r\nof common schools for the two creeds. In the latter respect the like\r\ntendency has been noted in the case of Germany.\r\n\r\nThe following are the chief specific points upon which the Irish system\r\nof elementary education differs from the English.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Irish elementary education.\r\n\r\n_Finance._--The state still makes building grants to the extent of\r\ntwo-thirds of the cost. Such grants are only made to what are called\r\nvested schools, that is to say, schools of which the premises are vested\r\nin trustees or in the commissioners themselves. The state further pays\r\nin the case of all national schools the entire cost of maintenance\r\nexcept only the upkeep of the building, and the provision of books after\r\nthe exhaustion of a first free grant.\r\n\r\n_Appointment and Payment of Teachers._--For the purpose of promotion the\r\nstate through its inspectors undertakes the duty of classifying the\r\nindividual teachers in four grades, passage from one grade to another\r\nbeing secured by examination. Appointments of teachers to schools are\r\nmade by the school managers subject to the approval of the\r\ncommissioners. Rights of dismissal are reserved to the local managers\r\nand also to the commissioners independently. Lastly, the teachers'\r\nsalaries are now paid directly by the state. The old system of payment\r\nby results was abandoned in 1900, and the teacher is paid (a) a fixed\r\nsalary according to grade, (b) a continued good service salary which may\r\nbe increased triennially, (c) a capitation payment.\r\n\r\n_Convent Schools._--In addition to the national schools supported as\r\nabove, there are a considerable number of convent or monastery schools\r\nwhich receive capitation grants after the English plan, but not direct\r\nsalaries. There were 308 such schools in 1908, with an average\r\nattendance of 70,003. There were also 83 other convent or monastery\r\nschools paid by personal salaries, with an average attendance of 11,075.\r\n\r\n_School Attendance and Free Education._--The Irish Education Act 1892\r\nprovided for compulsory attendance in towns and for the adoption of\r\ncompulsion in other districts. In virtue of the financial sections of\r\nthis act, which provided an increased grant for salaries, most national\r\nschools have become free.\r\n\r\n_General Elementary-School Statistics._--In 1908 the average number of\r\nscholars on the rolls of all the schools was 708,992, and the average\r\ndaily attendance was 494,662, or 69.8% as compared with the number on\r\nthe rolls. As regards religious denomination, 74.42% of the scholars on\r\nthe rolls were Roman Catholics; 28.6% were in schools attended by both\r\nRoman Catholic and Protestant children and 71.4% in schools attended\r\nsolely by Roman Catholics or solely by Protestants. The total\r\nexpenditure on the schools and teaching staffs was L1,591,214, of which\r\nL1,451,139, equivalent to L2, 19s. 3d. per scholar, was contributed from\r\nstate grants, and L140,074, equivalent to 5s. 9d. per scholar, from\r\nlocal (i.e. voluntary) sources, the rate per scholar from all sources\r\nbeing L3, 5s.\r\n\r\n_Training of Teachers._--Salaried monitors are employed in the Irish\r\nschools, but, unlike the English pupil teachers, are not explicitly\r\nrecognized as forming part of the school staff. There are now seven\r\ntraining colleges, viz. one undenominational college maintained by the\r\ncommissioners, five Roman Catholic colleges, and one college in\r\nconnexion with the Protestant Episcopal Church of Ireland. Of the\r\nscholars in the undenominational college, 73 out of 312 were Roman\r\nCatholics. The total number of students in training was 1189, viz. 514\r\nmen and 675 women. The percentage of trained teachers to the total\r\nnumber of teachers was 64.7. A special training college for the\r\ninstruction of teachers in Irish has been recognized.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Secondary education.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief desiderata in Irish education is a single central\r\nauthority for all branches of education, elementary, secondary (or\r\n\"intermediate\") and technical. There are two central authorities\r\ndealing with secondary education, viz. the Intermediate Education Board\r\nand the Department for Agriculture and Technical Instruction. The\r\nIntermediate Board administers sums available under the Intermediate\r\nEducation Act of 1878 from the Irish Church Surplus, and also the sum\r\nallocated under the Local Taxation Act 1890. The vice of the system in\r\nthe opinion of educational experts lies in the statutory obligation to\r\naward grants on the result of an individual examination of the scholars.\r\nAs a result of the vice-regal commission of 1898, power was taken to\r\nintroduce a system of school inspection, though not to dispense with the\r\nindividual examination as the basis for the award of the grants; this\r\nmeasure of reform was ultimately carried out in 1909. The sum\r\ndistributed in result grants is about L50,000 per annum.\r\n\r\nPrior to the Agriculture and Technical Instruction (Ireland) Act 1899,\r\nscience and art grants were administered by the Science and Art\r\nDepartment in England; by this act they were transferred to the new\r\nIrish Department for Agriculture and Technical Instruction. This\r\ndepartment makes block grants to secondary schools in respect of science\r\nand art teaching, and manual instruction or domestic economy. Measures\r\nhave been taken for the co-ordination of the duties of the Technical\r\nDepartment and the Intermediate Board, and the impetus given to the\r\nteaching of experimental science by grants for the erection of\r\nlaboratories represents a reform of undoubted value for higher education\r\nin Ireland, especially when considered in connexion with the enlistment\r\nof the local interest of the technical education committees in the\r\nintermediate schools. Nevertheless, in the absence of a reform of the\r\nresults system of intermediate grants, the special subsidizing of\r\nscience teaching has tended to put an undue premium upon this subject to\r\nthe detriment of the rest of the curriculum.\r\n\r\nIreland possesses no such system of scholarships for assisting the\r\npassage of scholars from the elementary to the secondary school as\r\nEngland enjoys as a result of the municipalization of the educational\r\nsystem. Nevertheless, Irish children as a fact pass much more freely\r\nfrom the elementary to the secondary school than is the case in England\r\nwhere social prejudices are stronger. The schools of the Christian\r\nBrothers are usually organized in two departments, primary and\r\nintermediate, and thus supply for the Roman Catholic population the\r\ndemand for the cheap type of secondary day school represented by the\r\nmunicipal schools in England. It must be added that the Irish\r\nintermediate schools are purely denominational. The widespread demand\r\nfor secondary education among the people, to which the report of Messrs\r\nDale and Stephens bears witness, is a gratifying feature of Irish life,\r\nwhile the recent establishment (1908) of the long-deferred national\r\nuniversity, and the perceptible quickening of intellectual interests\r\nthroughout the country in connexion with the Celtic revival, point to\r\nbetter conditions for higher education and to the development of a\r\nwider, deeper and truer, because more national, culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n_England._\r\n\r\nIt was justly observed by Sir Joshua Fitch (_Ency. Brit._, 10th ed.,\r\nxxvii. p. 655) that \"the public provision for the education of the\r\npeople in England is not the product of any theory or plan formulated\r\nbeforehand by statesmen or philosophers; it has come into existence\r\nthrough a long course of experiments, compromises, traditions,\r\nsuccesses, failures and religious controversies. What has been done in\r\nthis department of public policy is the resultant of many diverse forces\r\nand of slow evolution and growth rather than of pure purpose and\r\nwell-defined national aims. It has been effected in different degrees by\r\nphilanthropy, by private enterprise, by religious zeal, by ancient\r\nuniversities and endowed foundations, by municipal and local effort, and\r\nonly to a small extent by legislation. The genius--or rather\r\ncharacteristic habit--of the English people is averse from the\r\nphilosophical system, and is disposed to regard education, not as a\r\nscience, but as a body of expedients to be discovered empirically and\r\namended from time to time as occasion may require.\" Clearly, then, the\r\nEnglish system of public education, as it results from successive acts\r\nof the administration and the legislature, is one which can only\r\nadequately be appreciated in the light of an historical survey of the\r\nvarious stages which have led up to it and the social conditions by\r\nwhich they were determined. The history of state education in England\r\nbegins tardily in 1832, when after a generation of hesitation and\r\ncontroversy a beginning was made upon an exceedingly modest scale with\r\nthe system of treasury grants in aid of elementary schools. The diverse\r\nforces which were at that date at work in the education of the nation as\r\na whole, retarding state interference and marking out the limits within\r\nwhich it was long to be confined, derive their origin from a much\r\nremoter period.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Influence of the English Reformation.\r\n\r\nThe apprenticeship laws of Henry VIII. contain the earliest germ of\r\nstate interference. These laws obliged children between five and\r\nthirteen years of age who were found begging or idle to be bound\r\napprentices to some handicraft. If the immediate object was the\r\nprevention of crime rather than education as such, this early\r\nlegislation is at least significant of the primary and intimate\r\nconnexion that exists between popular education and industrial and\r\neconomic needs. Yet in the shaping of the educational system the\r\noriginal influences were religious rather than economic; hence the\r\nimportance of the canons of 1604, which secured the control of education\r\nto the Established Church. This of course was no novel doctrine, but\r\nmerely the reaffirmation by the Reformed Church of the Catholic\r\ntradition of religious exclusiveness, presenting itself to the mind of\r\ncontemporaries rather as the recognition of a national, that was also a\r\nreligious, duty than as the assumption of an ecclesiastical privilege.\r\nWhatever mischief the Tudor statesmen wrought by indiscriminate\r\ndestruction of chantries and other foundations which combined\r\neducational work with observances that the new religion branded as\r\nsuperstitions, however far the English Reformation fell short of the\r\norganized enthusiasm for popular education and culture that marked the\r\nfirst most vigorous and constructive period of Lutheranism in Germany,\r\nthe Protestant, and especially the Puritan, spirit unquestionably\r\ninspired a considerable volume of individual educational effort during\r\nthe latter half of the 16th and the first half of the 17th centuries.\r\nHere, as in Germany, the influence of the Reformation was wholly on the\r\nside of classicism, the dead languages being the key to the theological\r\nlearning which was of primary concern to the men of that theological\r\nage. The conception of elementary education as a system complete in\r\nitself and adapted to the needs of the masses of the people was\r\nunfamiliar at this date. The earliest elementary schools were _petits_\r\nschools, which (as the name implies) were really preparatory departments\r\nof the grammar-schools. Education in fact was still regarded as the\r\nprivilege of an elite, but, as in the middle ages, the elite for whom it\r\nwas sought to provide a ladder to the university by means of the endowed\r\nschools so numerously founded about this time was an elite of intellect\r\nand not of mere wealth; the class feeling which became so marked a\r\nfeature of English higher education was of much later growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Rise of elementary education.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the 17th century elementary education began to\r\ndifferentiate itself, partly by way of reaction against the unnatural\r\nclassicism of the preceding age, but more especially as the result of\r\nthe growth of towns and the creation of a considerable industrial\r\npopulation. At the close of the century the moral evils attendant upon\r\nindustrialism alarmed the religious conscience and prompted one of the\r\ngreat educational movements that stand to the credit of the national\r\nchurch. In 1699 Dr Bray founded the Society for Promoting Christian\r\nKnowledge, and the movement thereby initiated may be traced in the\r\nnumerous \"charity\" or \"Blue Coat\" schools scattered plentifully\r\nthroughout the country and especially in the great centres of\r\npopulation. The foundation of these schools, which was pushed forward\r\nwith vigour during the early years of the 18th century, represents an\r\nenergetic and well-planned attempt to cope with the social evil of\r\npoverty by educational means. The instruction was elementary, the\r\nscholars were clothed as well as taught free, and the schools in the\r\nfirst instance were supported not so much by permanent endowment as by\r\nvoluntary effort, so that with this movement the voluntary system may be\r\nsaid to make its appearance. Lastly, all these philanthropic efforts\r\nwere inspired by a solid but sober piety nurtured by a church which came\r\nnearer than at any other period of its history to enjoying the undivided\r\nallegiance of the people. Another notable movement in connexion with the\r\nchurch was one confined to Wales, that of the Welsh \"circulating\r\nschools\" established by Griffith Jones about 1730, consisting of an\r\norganized staff of schoolmasters who went round teaching adults to read\r\nthe Bible in Welsh. In the English rural parishes the comparative\r\nreligious unanimity favoured the quiet development of elementary\r\neducation in a small way upon less specifically religious lines.\r\nNumerous small endowments for the elementary education of poor children\r\nwere provided by well-to-do parishioners; indeed to such an extent did\r\nthe practice of making charitable (and largely educational) bequests\r\nincrease that the legislature intervened in the interest of private\r\ninheritance by reviving the law of mortmain in an act of 1736. The\r\nvillage schoolmaster became a feature of rural life, frequently enjoying\r\na schoolhouse provided sometimes by endowment and sometimes even\r\ndirectly by the parishioners at the cost of the rate levied by the\r\nvestry, but more often aided only by a little stipend from an endowment\r\nfor teaching poor children, and eking out an always scanty subsistence\r\nby the fees of such paying scholars as he could succeed in getting\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Sunday-school movement.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the 18th century the emergency of the industrial\r\nrevolution evoked a fresh religious effort upon a more highly organized\r\nscale in the shape of the Sunday-school movement, which may be said to\r\nrepresent the educational contribution of the Evangelical revival Robert\r\nRaikes, the founder of the Sunday School Union, established his first\r\nSunday school in 1782. The idea of the Sunday school did not originate\r\nwith Raikes; among earlier pioneers in this field were John Wesley, who\r\nheld Sunday classes at Savannah in 1737; Theophilus Lindsey at Catterick\r\nin the North Riding of Yorkshire, about 1769; Hannah Ball at High\r\nWycombe in 1769; and Jenkin Morgan near Llanidloes in 1770. Sunday\r\nschools, too, had been founded in England by Joseph Alleine, the Puritan\r\nFather, in the 17th century, and in Catholic Italy and France by St\r\nCharles Borromeo and Jean Baptiste de la Salle in the 16th and 17th\r\ncenturies respectively. Nevertheless, in virtue of his achievement in\r\norganization, Raikes is rightly regarded as the founder of the English\r\nSunday school. The peculiar value of the Sunday-school system in its\r\nearly days lay in the combination of secular with religious instruction;\r\nin many cases the school was held on Saturday as well as Sunday, and its\r\nrestriction to the one day or two days was due to the prevalence of\r\nchild labour under stress of the great industrial expansion. With better\r\neconomic conditions and with the development of day schools the Sunday\r\nschools gradually became restricted in function to purely religious\r\ninstruction. Even with this limitation there is no doubt that the great\r\nSunday-school organizations of the various churches still deserve to be\r\nreckoned among the educational assets of the nation, and as agencies\r\nboth of religious instruction and of general culture they may tend,\r\nunder modern educational and religious developments, to play an\r\nincreasingly important part.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Movements of Lancaster and Bell, and rise of the religious controversy.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the 18th century the development of industry and the\r\nsocial unrest which followed the French Revolution combined to bring\r\nhome to the public mind the need of a national system of day schools.\r\nUnfortunately, just at this moment the revival of Nonconformity as the\r\nresult of the religious vitality of the Evangelical movement shattered\r\nthe religious peace of the early Hanoverian period and divided the\r\nnation once more into hostile camps, to which class distinctions lent\r\nadditional bitterness. The famous controversy between Andrew Bell and\r\nJoseph Lancaster and their respective followers in the opening years of\r\nthe 19th century served to define the religious difficulty substantially\r\nin the form in which it exists after the lapse of a century for the\r\npresent generation. Both these remarkable men conceived independently\r\nthe idea of a national system of popular education upon a voluntary\r\nbasis; both concurred in extolling the merits of the monitorial system,\r\nwhich each claimed to have originated. The controversy between them,\r\nbegun upon personal grounds, resolved itself into a national contest of\r\nrival principles of religious teaching. Lancaster as a young Quaker\r\nschoolmaster, confronted with pupils drawn from various religious\r\nbodies, planned his religious instruction upon the lines of doctrine\r\ncommon to all the orthodox Christian denominations. Thus he is the\r\nfather of the undenominational religious teaching which later formed the\r\nbasis of the Cowper-Temple compromise. But whereas the Cowper-Temple\r\nclause is purely negative in form and so seems to point to an undogmatic\r\nreligion, the Lancasterian teaching was essentially positive and\r\ndogmatic within its limits. In 1805 Mrs Trimmer opened the attack upon\r\nLancaster's system with a work bearing the expressive title of _A\r\nComparative View of the New Plan of Education promulgated by Mr Joseph\r\nLancaster and of the System of Christian Instruction founded by our\r\nForefathers for the initiation of the young members of the Established\r\nChurch in the Principles of the Reformed Religion_. The church as a\r\nwhole refused to co-operate in religious teaching upon the basis of a\r\ncommon Christianity, and joined issue with Lancaster and his Whig and\r\nNonconformist following not merely upon the question of the exclusion of\r\ndogmatic formularies, but also upon the question of the control of\r\nwhatever religious teaching should be given. In fact the vital question\r\nat this period was whether the clergy of the Established Church were to\r\ncontrol the national education. The religious issue was prominent in\r\nconnexion with the remarkable attempt at legislation made by the Whig\r\nstatesman Mr Whitbread in his Parochial Schools Bill of 1807. As\r\noriginally introduced, the bill proposed to make it compulsory on\r\nparochial vestries to levy rates for the support of schools for teaching\r\nreading, writing and arithmetic. The compulsory provisions were dropped\r\nin the House of Commons, but the bill was rejected by the Lords, mainly\r\non the ground that it did not place education on a religious basis or\r\nsufficiently secure control to the minister of the parish.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Foundation of voluntary schools.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the liberal proposals of Whitbread, and the strength of\r\nthe Dissenting opposition to any settlement on purely church lines (such\r\nas that advocated by Bell in 1808 for establishing schools under the\r\ncontrol of the parochial clergy), rendered recourse to voluntary effort\r\ninevitable. In 1808 the Royal Lancasterian Society was formed to carry\r\non the work of Lancaster, the name being afterwards changed, owing to\r\npersonal difficulties due to the wayward character of Lancaster, to the\r\nBritish and Foreign School Society. In the following year the National\r\nSociety for Promoting the Education of the Poor in the Principles of the\r\nEstablished Church throughout England and Wales was formed, with Bell as\r\nits superintendent. In voluntary effort on a grand scale the church\r\neasily outdistanced her opponents, and in 1831 the National Society was\r\nable to show that there were in all over 13,000 schools in connexion\r\nwith the church, of which 6470 were both day and Sunday schools, having\r\na total attendance of 409,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Monitorial system.\r\n\r\nThe rapid development of the voluntary school system was no doubt\r\ngreatly facilitated by the monitorial plan of teaching, upon which Bell\r\nand Lancaster equally relied. Probably the first idea of utilizing the\r\nolder pupils to teach the younger presented itself independently to\r\nLancaster in the Borough Road and to Bell in Madras. The monitorial plan\r\nnever rested upon any educational theory; it was simply a makeshift, a\r\nrough-and-ready expedient for overcoming the practical difficulty caused\r\nby the dearth of competent teachers. Historically it is important as the\r\nprecursor of the pupil-teacher system which so long formed the exclusive\r\nbasis of the English elementary system.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Activities of Brougham.\r\n\r\nMeantime a further political move was attempted by Brougham, who\r\nincluded educational reform among his multifarious activities. In 1816\r\nhe procured the appointment of a general commission of inquiry into\r\nendowed charities. The labours of this great inquisition lasted for\r\ntwenty years and led to the reformation of many cases of abuse or waste\r\nof wealthy endowments, and eventually to the establishment of the\r\nCharity Commission in 1853. In 1820 Brougham introduced a remarkable\r\nbill which proposed to make the magistrates in quarter sessions the\r\nrating authority, to require teachers to be members of the Church of\r\nEngland and to be appointed upon a certificate from the parochial\r\nclergyman, and on the other hand to prohibit religious formularies and\r\nto confine religious instruction to Bible reading without comment. The\r\nbill naturally failed through the opposition cf the Dissenters, and\r\nserved only to accentuate the religious impasse.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Treasury grants.\r\n\r\nIn 1832 the Whig government which passed the Reform Bill placed on the\r\nEstimates a sum of L20,000 for public education, thus initiating the\r\nsystem of the annual grant voted by parliament and dispensed under\r\nregulations framed by administrative act. The grant of 1832 was\r\nadministered by the treasury and not by a special department, under\r\ncertain conditions laid down by treasury minute of August 30, 1833. The\r\nchief of these were that grants were confined to the erection of school\r\nbuildings, and were to be administered only through the National and the\r\nBritish and Foreign School societies; there was a provision for audit,\r\nbut no condition of inspection.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Establishment of State-aided system.\r\n\r\nIn 1839 Lord Melbourne's government by means of an order in council\r\nestablished a separate education office under the style of the Committee\r\nof Council on Education, and the sum voted by parliament was increased\r\nto L39,000. The original intention of the government was to establish a\r\nstate normal school or training college as the foundation of a national\r\nsystem of education. Unfortunately this design had to be abandoned in\r\nview of the religious difficulty, with the result (so fruitful in\r\ncontroversy at the present time) that the training of elementary\r\nteachers was left in private hands and became a stronghold of the\r\nvoluntary and denominational interests. In view of the limited resources\r\nplaced at their disposal by parliament, the Committee of Council were at\r\nfirst compelled to confine their assistance to capital grants in aid of\r\nthe provision of school buildings, but in the distribution of the money\r\nthree important conditions were at once imposed. In the first place, the\r\ncontinuing right of inspection was required in all cases; secondly,\r\npromoters were obliged to conform to a fixed standard of structural\r\nefficiency; thirdly, the building must be settled upon trusts\r\npermanently securing it to the education of poor children.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Concordat with the church.\r\n\r\nBy the minute of August 10, 1840, the Committee of Council concluded\r\nwhat came to be known as the concordat with the church. Under this\r\nminute no appointment was to be made of any person to inspect schools in\r\nconnexion with the Church of England without the concurrence of the\r\narchbishop of the province, and, what seems still more extraordinary to\r\nmodern ideas, any such appointment was to be revoked should the\r\narchbishop at any time withdraw his concurrence. The inspectors were\r\ncharged with the duty of inspecting religious teaching, but under\r\ninstructions to be framed by the archbishop, and their reports were to\r\nbe transmitted in duplicate to the archbishop and the bishop for the\r\ninformation of these authorities. Further, the general instructions of\r\nthe Committee of Council themselves were to be communicated to the\r\narchbishop before being finally sanctioned. The march of events, and in\r\nparticular the altered financial relations between the state and the\r\nvoluntary managers brought about by the institution of maintenance\r\ngrants, soon rendered this concordat obsolete, but it remains\r\nhistorically important as showing how at the outset the denominational\r\nprinciple was recognized and fostered by the state.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Trust deeds.\r\n\r\nAmong the first acts of the Committee of Council was the promulgation of\r\na set of model trusts deeds, one or other of which applicants for\r\nbuilding grants were required to adopt for the settlement of their\r\nschool premises. The necessary conditions were the permanent\r\nappropriation of the site to purposes of education, and the permanent\r\nright of government inspection; it must, however, be noted that this\r\nlatter right was generally limited in terms to the inspection provided\r\nfor by the minute of August 10, 1840. A conscience clause was not\r\nobligatory, and indeed was only offered in the limited form of exemption\r\nfrom instruction in formularies and attendance at Sunday school or\r\npublic worship. A more systematic attempt to promote public control by\r\nmeans of trust deeds in 1846 led the Committee of Council into a\r\ncontroversy with the National Society which extended over a period of\r\nthree years, turning chiefly upon the management clauses and the\r\nquestion of appeals, and resulting in compromises which constituted a\r\nfresh concordat with the church. In point of fact, the management\r\nclauses proved to be of little practical consequence, save in a few\r\ncontroversial cases, until the act of 1902, which had the effect of\r\nbringing them once more into prominence in connexion with the\r\nconstitution of statutory bodies of foundation managers. The act of 1902\r\nalso dealt specifically with two other points arising upon the old trust\r\ndeeds, viz. the control of religious instruction and the appeal to the\r\nbishop in religious questions. Special facilities for the conveyance of\r\nland for school purposes were afforded to limited owners by the School\r\nSites Acts of 1841 and subsequent years. The landed gentry responded\r\nwith great public spirit to the call thus made upon their generosity by\r\nthe state, with the result that the vast majority of rural, and many\r\nurban, parishes were freely endowed with sites for elementary schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Grammar Schools Act 1840.\r\n\r\nThe Grammar Schools Act of 1840, which was passed to deal with the case\r\nof the decayed \"grammar\" (i.e. classical) schools which abounded\r\nthroughout the country, belongs to the history of elementary rather than\r\nsecondary education. It expressly empowered the Court of Chancery, where\r\nthe endowment was insufficient for a classical school, to substitute\r\nsubjects of useful learning analogous to those contained in the original\r\ntrusts. As a result of this act a considerable number of ancient\r\nendowments were reorganized so as to afford an improved elementary\r\ninstead of an inefficient classical education, and the schemes made\r\nunder the act constituted an early, but not very successful, experiment\r\nin the direction of higher elementary schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Training-college grants.\r\n\r\nIn 1843 the Committee of Council decided to make grants in aid of the\r\nerection of normal schools or training colleges in connexion with the\r\nNational Society and the British and Foreign School societies, thus\r\nmarking the definite abandonment of the provision of training colleges\r\nto voluntary effort.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Pupil-teacher system.\r\n\r\nIn 1846 an important step forwards was taken in the foundation of the\r\npupil-teacher system. The regulations of this year inaugurated annual\r\nmaintenance grants in the form of stipends for apprenticed pupil\r\nteachers receiving a prescribed course of instruction under the head\r\nteacher, and a lower grade of stipendiary monitors in schools where such\r\ninstruction could not be provided. These regulations inaugurated the\r\nsystem of Queen's Scholarships to assist pupil teachers to proceed to a\r\ntraining college; they also established capitation grants for the\r\nsupport of such colleges, and annual grants to elementary schools under\r\ngovernment inspection of from L15 to L30 in aid of the salary of every\r\ntrained teacher employed. Provision was at the same time made for\r\nretiring pensions to elementary teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Extension of state aid to Wesleyans, Roman Catholics and Jews.\r\n\r\nDown to 1847 state aid was confined to two religious categories of\r\nschools: those giving specifically Church of England teaching, and those\r\nin connexion with the British and Foreign School Society giving simple\r\nBible teaching. To facilitate the recognition of other denominational\r\nschools the Committee of Council in 1847 issued a minute dispensing\r\nschools not connected with the Established Church from inquiries\r\nconcerning their religious condition, and in the same year state aid was\r\nextended to Wesleyan and Roman Catholic schools. The settlement of model\r\ntrust deeds gave occasion for each of these two great religious bodies\r\nto negotiate a kind of concordat with respect to school management, and\r\nthe Roman Catholic deed was only settled after a controversy, similar to\r\nthat which had arisen with the National Society, as to the rights of\r\necclesiastical authority. Jewish schools received recognition in 1851\r\nupon condition that the Scriptures of the Old Testament should be daily\r\nread in them.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Bills of 1842-57.\r\n\r\nDuring the middle years of the century various unsuccessful legislative\r\nattempts were made to establish a national system of elementary schools\r\nupon the basis of rate-aid. These attempts began with the education\r\nclauses of Sir Robert Peel's Factory Bill of 1842, and were renewed in a\r\nseries of bills from 1853 to 1857, of which one set was introduced by\r\nLord John Russell on behalf of the Whig government, whilst a second was\r\npromoted by an organization called the Manchester and Salford Committee\r\non Education, in the denominational interest, and a third set by an\r\norganization called the Lancashire (afterwards the National) Public\r\nSchools Association, in the secular interest. The only one of these\r\nattempts which calls for notice here is the bill introduced by Lord John\r\nRussell (called the Borough Bill, on account of its being restricted to\r\nmunicipal boroughs) in 1853, and forming part of a comprehensive scheme\r\nof legislative and administrative reform of which a portion was actually\r\ncarried into effect. The bill as a measure for elementary education was\r\nsupplemented by an administrative system of capitation grants for rural\r\nareas. The government scheme also comprised a measure dealing with the\r\nadministration of charitable trusts (which took shape as the Charitable\r\nTrusts Act 1853), the constitution of the Department of Science and Art,\r\nand university reform upon the lines recommended by the Oxford and\r\nCambridge commissions. The Borough Bill left it optional with\r\nmunicipalities to adopt the act. It provided for the appointment of a\r\nschool committee, one half of whose members might be non-members of the\r\ncouncil. The school committee was merely given power to assist existing\r\nvoluntary schools out of the rates. No provision was made for public\r\ncontrol beyond the requirement of audit; the sole condition as to\r\nreligious instruction was the acceptance of a conscience clause.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Capitation grants.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the Borough Bill did not affect the new system of\r\ncapitation grants which was introduced by minute of the Committee of\r\nCouncil dated April 2, 1853. These grants were fixed at a scale varying\r\nfrom 3s. to 6s. per head, payable upon certain conditions, of which the\r\nmost important were that the school must be under a certificated\r\nteacher, and that three-fourths of the children must pass a prescribed\r\nexamination. In consequence of the failure of the several fresh bills\r\nintroduced in 1855 by the government, the church party and the secular\r\nparty respectively amplifying the proposals previously brought forward,\r\nthe capitation grant was, by minute of January 26, 1856, extended to\r\nurban areas. As in the case of all the early grants, the regulations\r\ngoverning the distribution of the capitation grants were framed upon the\r\nprinciple that subventions of public money must be met by local funds\r\nderived from voluntary contributions, endowments and school fees; thus\r\nthe basis of the denominational system as fostered by the state at this\r\nstage was one of financial partnership.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Education minister, 1856.\r\n\r\nIn 1856 a purely administrative bill was passed, establishing the office\r\nof vice-president of the Committee of Council on Education as a minister\r\nresponsible to parliament. At the same time, the Science and Art\r\nDepartment was transferred from the Board of Trade to the Committee of\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Newcastle Commission.\r\n\r\nThe progress of state-aided education during this period may be measured\r\nby the increase of the annual parliamentary grant, which rose from\r\nL30,000 in 1839 to L100,000 in 1846, L150,000 in 1851, L396,000 in 1855,\r\nand L663,400 in 1858. This expansion was viewed with misgiving by the\r\nfriends of the denominational system, and by the strong individualist\r\nschool of that day, who upon wider grounds clung to the old ideal of\r\nvoluntary initiative. These sections combined with the advocates of\r\nfurther state intervention to press for a commission of inquiry, and at\r\nthe instance of Sir John Pakington (the eminent Conservative\r\neducationist who was responsible for the denominational bills of the\r\n'fifties) a royal commission was appointed in 1858, under the\r\nchairmanship of the duke of Newcastle, to inquire into the state of\r\npopular education in England, and to consider and report what measures,\r\nif any, were required for the extension of sound and cheap elementary\r\ninstruction to all classes of the people. The _Report_ of the Newcastle\r\nCommission, issued in 1861, contains an exhaustive account of the\r\nexisting condition of elementary education, and, with due allowance for\r\nthe grave defects revealed, and in particular the glaring inefficiency\r\nof the numerous little private-venture schools kept by \"dames\" and\r\nothers, the graphic picture drawn by the commissioners constitutes a\r\nstriking tribute to the sterling qualities of self-help and religious\r\nearnestness which were so characteristic of the early Victorian period.\r\nIt was found that in round numbers about 2,500,000 children were\r\nattending day schools, the proportion to population being 1 in 7, as\r\ncompared with 1 in 9 in France, 1 in 8 in Holland, and 1 in 6 in\r\nPrussia, where education was compulsory. On the other hand, of this\r\nnumber only 1,675,000 were in public schools of all kinds, only\r\n1,100,000 in schools liable to inspection, and 917,000 in schools\r\nreceiving annual grant. The result was that only one child in every\r\ntwenty was attending a school whose efficiency could be in any way\r\nguaranteed by the state. In the constructive portion of their work the\r\ncomments and recommendations of the commissioners reflected the\r\nprevailing perplexity of the public mind. A consistent individualistic\r\nminority considered that the annual grant should be withdrawn\r\naltogether, and that any further state aid should be confined to\r\nbuilding grants, which they would concede not as desirable in themselves\r\nbut as necessitated out of considerations of fairness to the parishes\r\nthat had not yet received such aid. The commissioners as a body rejected\r\nfree and compulsory education in view of the religious difficulty and\r\nupon general grounds of individualistic principle. Of the religious\r\ndifficulty itself the commissioners had some wise words to say which\r\nhold good in substance at the present time. In their judgment the\r\nconsiderable evidence they had amassed conclusively proved that the\r\nreligious difficulty originated with the managers, promoters and\r\norganizers of the schools, and not with the parents themselves; yet the\r\nindifferent or comparatively passive attitude of the people nowise\r\nmaterially diminished the practical difficulty of introducing a\r\ncomprehensive system, since it was not with the body of the people but\r\nwith the founders and supporters of schools that legislators would\r\nalways have to deal. In view of the solution adopted in 1902 it is of\r\ninterest to note that the Newcastle Commissioners deliberately rejected\r\nthe parish as unfit to be taken as the unit of elementary education upon\r\nthe ground that management by parochial ratepayers must tend to be\r\nilliberal and niggardly, bent upon economy of the rates to the detriment\r\nof educational interests; accordingly they recommended the constitution\r\nof county boards (which in the absence of elective councils must needs\r\noriginate with quarter sessions) clothed with power to levy a rate for\r\nthe aid of existing voluntary schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Payment by results.\r\n\r\nThe one definite achievement of the Newcastle Commission was the famous\r\nsystem of payment by results, which may be said to have excited a keener\r\nand more prolonged controversy than any other measure of a purely\r\neducational character. Impressed by the defects of the existing\r\nteaching, the commissioners reported that there was only one way of\r\nsecuring efficiency, and that was to institute a searching examination\r\nby competent authority of every child in every school to which grants\r\nwere to be paid, with the view of ascertaining whether the indispensable\r\nelements of knowledge were thoroughly acquired, and to make the\r\nprospects and position of the teacher dependent to a considerable extent\r\nupon the results of this examination. Thus the commissioners hoped to\r\ncounteract what appeared to them to be the crying defect of the existing\r\ntraining college system, viz. that it tended mainly to adapt the young\r\nschoolmaster to advance his higher, rather than to thoroughly ground his\r\njunior, pupils. They recognized that to raise the character of the\r\nchildren, both morally and intellectually, was and must always be the\r\nhighest aim of education, and they were far from desiring to supersede\r\nthis by any plan of a mere examination into the more mechanical work of\r\nelementary education, the reading, writing and arithmetic of young\r\nchildren; but they thought that the importance of this training, which\r\nmust be the foundation of all other teaching, had been lost sight of,\r\nand that there was justice in the common complaint that while a fourth\r\nof the scholars were really taught, three-fourths after leaving school\r\nforgot everything they had learnt there.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Revised Code.\r\n\r\nMr Lowe (Lord Sherbrooke) as vice-president of the Committee of Council\r\n(1859-1864) adopted the system of payment by results in what became\r\nfamous in history as the Revised Code, issued in 1862 and so called\r\nbecause it was a revision of the minutes and regulations of the\r\nCommittee of Council, which were first collected and issued in the form\r\nof a code in 1860. The Revised Code provided for the payment of a grant\r\nof 4s. upon the old principle and a further grant of not more than 8s.\r\nupon the result of examination. Mr Lowe declared of the system in the\r\nHouse of Commons that \"if it was costly it should at least be efficient;\r\nand if it was inefficient it should at least be cheap.\" In fact, it\r\nproved to be cheap; the giant fell from L813,400 in 1861 to L636,800 in\r\n1865. The upholders of the existing system denounced the Revised Code as\r\nan undeserved slight upon the voluntary managers, and even as a breach\r\nof faith with the great religious denominations. On purely educational\r\ngrounds, which need not be here re-capitulated, it was at once viewed\r\nwith misgiving by many authorities, including Matthew Arnold. To meet\r\nobjections, some modifications were introduced in the code under the\r\nConservative government in 1867. The system of paying grant upon the\r\nresult of individual examination of the scholars was not finally\r\nabolished till 1904.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Proceedings preliminary to the act of 1870.\r\n\r\nThe years immediately preceding 1870 were occupied with discussion and\r\npreparation for the great legislative measure for which the time was now\r\nfelt to have arrived. Good work was done in this direction by the Select\r\nCommittee of the House of Commons in 1866, over which Sir John Pakington\r\npresided. For reasons connected with the political situation of the\r\nmoment this committee never reported, but the minutes of evidence and\r\nthe draft report prepared by Sir John Pakington contained much valuable\r\nmaterial in the way of criticism of the existing system and suggestion\r\nfor the coming settlement; in particular the draft report insisted upon\r\nthe inevitableness of an education rate. In 1868 the Conservative\r\ngovernment brought in, but did not proceed with, an education bill\r\ndeliberately discarding the principle of rate-aid on the ground that it\r\nwould destroy voluntary contributions and gradually starve out the\r\ndenominational schools. In 1867 and again in 1868 Mr Bruce (afterwards\r\nLord Aberdare), Mr W.E. Forster and Mr Algernon Egerton introduced a\r\nbill which formed the basis of the measure of 1870. As redrafted in 1868\r\nthe bill of Mr Bruce and his coadjutors proposed a universal system of\r\nmunicipal and parochial rating with liberty for voluntary schools to\r\nunite themselves to the rate-aided system under their existing\r\nmanagement, subject to the acceptance of a conscience clause. The bill\r\nalso proposed to empower town councils to co-opt outsiders upon their\r\neducation committees. Thus both in the principle of co-optation and in\r\nthe extension of rate aid to schools not under public control the bill\r\nof these Liberal statesmen in 1868 anticipated certain controverted\r\nfeatures of Mr Balfour's Education Act of 1902. In the meantime, in the\r\ncountry the Education League, originated at Birmingham, was carrying on\r\na propaganda in favour of free secular schools, whilst the Education\r\nUnion, formed to counteract the influence of the league, urged a\r\nsettlement upon the old lines. As a concession to the popular feeling\r\nagainst secularism, the league proposed to allow Bible reading without\r\ndoctrinal exposition. Thus opinion was sufficiently focussed to enable\r\nMr Gladstone's administration in 1870 to undertake the comprehensive\r\nmeasure of educational reform for which the country had had to wait so\r\nlong.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Act of 1870.\r\n\r\nThe Elementary Education Act of 1870 bore in every respect the marks of\r\ncompromise. As Mr Forster explained in introducing the bill, the object\r\nof the government was \"to complete the voluntary system and to fill up\r\ngaps,\" not to supplant it. To this end the Education Department was\r\ncharged with the duty of ascertaining whether or not there was in every\r\nparish a deficiency of public school accommodation, and provision made\r\nfor the formation of school boards in every school district (i.e. parish\r\nor municipal borough) requiring further public school accommodation.\r\nSuch accommodation might consist either of public elementary schools as\r\ndefined by the act, or other schools giving efficient and suitable\r\nelementary education. The definition of public elementary school\r\ncontained in section 7 of the act is still in force. Shortly, a public\r\nelementary school is a school subject to a conscience clause entitling\r\nscholars to complete exemption from all religious instruction and\r\nobservance whatsoever. Any religious instruction or observance in the\r\nschool must be either at the beginning or the end of the school meeting.\r\nThe school must also be open at all times to the government inspectors\r\nand must be conducted in accordance with the conditions required to be\r\nfulfilled in order to obtain an annual parliamentary grant. In the same\r\nconnexion an important change was made in the conditions of inspection\r\nby declaring that it should be no part of the duties of the inspector to\r\ninquire into religious instruction, whilst a later section of the act\r\nprovided that no parliamentary grant should be made in respect of any\r\nreligious instruction.\r\n\r\nThree important changes were made in the measure during its passage\r\nthrough parliament. As at first proposed, (1) the school boards were not\r\nto be directly elected by the ratepayers, but were to be appointed by\r\nthe town council or the vestry. (2) These nominated boards were\r\nempowered either to provide schools themselves or to assist existing\r\npublic elementary schools, provided that such assistance was granted on\r\nequal terms to all such schools, upon conditions to be approved by the\r\nEducation Department. Thus the school board, if it exercised the option\r\nof assisting denominational schools, would have been obliged to assist\r\nall or none. (3) With regard to its own schools, the school board was to\r\nsettle the form of religious instruction. These proposals raised serious\r\nopposition in the country, and when the committee stage of the bill was\r\nreached two fundamental changes were made in the policy of the bill. In\r\nthe first place, as Mr Gladstone put it, the government had decided \"to\r\nsever altogether the tie between the local board and the voluntary\r\nschools.\" In lieu of the suggested rate-aid they proposed an increased\r\ngrant from the treasury, that is to say, the voluntary schools were left\r\nstanding as state-aided schools under private management, side by side\r\nwith the new rate-supported schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Cowper-Temple clause.\r\n\r\nNext, the character of the religious instruction in the board schools\r\nwas determined upon an undenominational basis by a provision which has\r\nbecome known to history after the name of its author, then Mr\r\nCowper-Temple, as the Cowper-Temple clause (section 14 of the act),\r\ndirecting that \"no religious catechism or religious formulary which is\r\ndistinctive of any particular denomination shall be taught in the\r\nschool.\" The clause was not intended to exclude doctrinal exposition,\r\nand was in fact a compromise not merely between absolute secularism and\r\ndenominationalism, but between denominationalism and the view of those\r\nwho would have the Bible read without note or comment. The Apostles'\r\nCreed as a symbol common to all denominations of Christians was held by\r\nMr Forster (at the suggestion of Mr Gladstone) not to be excluded under\r\nthe Cowper-Temple clause. The result was the establishment in the\r\nschools, upon the lines laid down by Joseph Lancaster at the beginning\r\nof the 19th century, of what may be termed the common Protestantism of\r\nthe English nation; and though Mr Disraeli urged that a religion without\r\nformularies was in fact a new religion, and that in leaving its\r\nexposition to the teachers we were creating a new sacerdotal class, the\r\nCowper-Temple compromise, notwithstanding its inherent want of logic,\r\nstood the test of experience for more than a generation against the\r\nconsistent denominationalists on the one hand and the party of secular\r\neducation on the other. It is important to observe that the act of 1870\r\nleft the giving of religious instruction, whether in voluntary schools\r\n(in which its inclusion might be assumed as of course) or in board\r\nschools, purely permissive. In practice it was only in Wales that school\r\nboards availed themselves to any extent of the liberty to abstain from\r\ngiving religious instruction, and this comparative secularism of Wales\r\ncertainly argued no lack of religious life among the people.\r\n\r\nThe third change in the bill was the substitution of the _ad hoc_ school\r\nboard for the municipally appointed board originally proposed, a change\r\nwhich commended itself in view of the special difficulty presented by\r\nthe case of London. These boards were elected by the system of\r\ncumulative voting under which each elector had as many votes as there\r\nwere candidates to be elected, with liberty to give all his votes to one\r\ncandidate or to distribute them amongst the candidates as he thought\r\nfit. This system was much criticized as being unduly favourable to\r\nminorities, whose representation it was devised to secure; it continued,\r\nhowever, until the supersession of the _ad hoc_ authorities by\r\ncommittees of the county and urban councils under the act of 1902.\r\n\r\nSchool boards were empowered not only to acquire sites for schools under\r\npowers of compulsory purchase, but also to take transfers of existing\r\nvoluntary schools from their managers. The section which enables\r\nmanagers to transfer schools to the school board or local education\r\nauthority for the purpose of board or council schools freed from\r\nreligious trusts unquestionably marks an important inroad by the state\r\nupon the sanctity of trusts. Thus though the act of 1870 did not itself\r\nintroduce the principle of compulsory transfer, it formed the point of\r\ndeparture for the proposals in this direction which were the basis of\r\nthe unsuccessful bills of 1906 and 1908. The act of 1870 did not\r\nintroduce either direct compulsory attendance or free education, but it\r\ntook a distinct step forward in each direction by enabling school boards\r\nto frame by-laws rendering attendance compulsory, and also to pay the\r\nschool fees in the case of poverty of the parent.\r\n\r\nThe policy of compromise between the two systems of voluntary and\r\nrate-established schools was carried out in the provisions relating to\r\nthe future supply of schools. On the one hand, building grants were\r\ncontinued temporarily for the benefit of those who applied (as voluntary\r\nmanagers alone could apply) before the 31st of December 1870. On the\r\nother hand, the Education Department was authorized to refuse\r\nparliamentary grants to schools established in school board districts\r\nafter the passing of the act if they thought such schools unnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Progress under the act of 1870.\r\n\r\nThe following figures are of interest as showing the progress made under\r\nthe act of 1870. In the year 1870 there was accommodation in inspected\r\nday schools for about 2,000,000 children; the average attendance was\r\n1,168,000, and the number on the books about 1,500,000. It was computed,\r\nhowever, that there were, exclusive of the well-to-do classes, at least\r\n1,500,000 children who attended no school at all or schools not under\r\ninspection. In 1876 accommodation had been provided for nearly\r\n3,500,000, and of the 1,500,000 new places nearly two-thirds were\r\nprovided by voluntary agencies. \"These voluntary agencies,\" says Sir H.\r\nCraik, \"had received grants in aid for about one-third of the schools\r\nthey had built, the grants defraying about one-fifth of the cost of the\r\naided schools.\" On the other hand, the growth of school boards was rapid\r\nand continuous, notwithstanding the permissive character of the act and\r\nthe strenuous efforts of the voluntaryists to keep pace with the new\r\ndemands. In 1872, 9,700,000 of the population were under school boards,\r\nand of these 8,142,000 were under by-laws; in 1876 the numbers were\r\nrespectively 12,500,000 and 10,400,000. In the same period the annual\r\ngrants increased from L894,000 in 1870 to L1,600,000 in 1876.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Act of 1876.\r\n\r\nThe development evidenced by the above figures, and in particular the\r\nfact that 52% of the population were subject to by-laws, enabled Mr\r\nDisraeli's government in 1876 to take a notable step forward in the\r\ndirection of universal direct compulsion. The act of 1876 embodied the\r\ndeclaration that \"it shall be the duty of the parent of every child to\r\ncause such child to receive efficient elementary instruction in\r\nreading, writing and arithmetic, and if such parent fail to perform\r\nsuch duty he shall be liable to such orders and penalties as are\r\nprovided by the Act\"; next, it rendered an employer liable to a penalty\r\nwho took into his employment a child under the age of ten years, or a\r\nchild between the ages of ten and fourteen years who had not obtained\r\nthe required certificate of proficiency in reading, writing and\r\narithmetic, or of previous attendance at a certified efficient school.\r\nIn order to complete the machinery for compulsion, the act directed\r\nthat, in every district where there was no school board, a school\r\nattendance committee should be appointed by the local authority. The law\r\nas to school attendance, resting upon this and subsequent enactments, is\r\ncomplicated and in some details obscure. The subject was dealt with in\r\nthe report of an inter-departmental committee in 1909, who recommended\r\nthe abolition of the partial exemptions permitted, and the raising of\r\nthe age of exemption to 13.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Act of 1880.\r\n\r\nIn 1880 Mr Mundella, as vice-president of the Council in Mr Gladstone's\r\nadministration, passed a short act which made the framing of by-laws\r\ncompulsory upon school boards and school attendance committees, thus\r\ncompleting the system of universal direct compulsion. Under the acts of\r\n1876 and 1880 the average attendance increased from 2,000,000 in 1876 to\r\n3,500,000 in 1878 and 4,000,000 in 1881; in terms of percentage to\r\npopulation, 8.06 in 1876, 9.60 in 1878, and 10.69 in 1881. In the\r\nlast-mentioned year the annual grant rose to L2,200,000, having more\r\nthan doubled in the decade.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Development of public opinion.\r\n\r\nWith the passing of the Elementary Education Act 1880 the education\r\nquestion entered upon a new phase. The country was now possessed of a\r\nnational system of elementary education, in the sense that provision was\r\nmade for the supply of efficient schools and for compulsory attendance.\r\nThe question of free education was brought within the range of practical\r\npolitics by the adoption of universal compulsion, but as yet it was\r\nadvocated only by a small political group of pronounced collectivist\r\ntendencies. Whilst opinion was maturing on this topic, there began to\r\nforce itself upon the public mind the vastly more difficult problem of\r\ncombining the two systems of voluntary, denominational, state-aided\r\nschools on the one hand, and public, undenominational, rate-supported\r\nschools on the other. From the denominational point of view the problem\r\npresented itself as that of a burden imposed and a danger threatened in\r\never-increasing degree by the competition of the board schools, a\r\ncompetition that was felt not so much by direct rivalry of school with\r\nschool as indirectly by the steady raising of the standard of efficiency\r\nwith respect to buildings, equipment, salaries of teachers and\r\neducational attainment which inevitably resulted from the establishment\r\nof authorities with power to draw upon the rates. On the other hand,\r\nfrom the purely educational point of view, it was seen that the dual\r\nsystem tended in practice to an illicit but almost inevitable\r\nrecognition of two standards of efficiency, the lower being conceded to\r\nvoluntary schools in consideration of their comparative poverty.\r\nExperience, too, of the shortcomings of small country school boards was\r\nbeginning to confirm the misgivings entertained long before by the\r\nNewcastle Commissioners as to the wisdom of entrusting autonomous powers\r\nto the parish, when the reform of local government by the creation of\r\npopularly elected county authorities turned attention once more to the\r\nquestion of organizing education upon a county basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Cross Commission, 1887.\r\n\r\nIn 1887 a royal commission under the presidency of Viscount Cross was\r\nappointed to inquire into the working of the education acts. The labours\r\nof this commission produced a thorough discussion of the educational\r\nproblem in all its aspects, political, administrative, scholastic and\r\nreligious. For any clear recommendations with regard to the\r\nreorganization of education generally the moment was not opportune,\r\ninasmuch as the commission just preceded the establishment of the new\r\ncounty authorities and the powers with respect to instruction other than\r\nelementary which parliament was shortly to confide to them under the\r\nTechnical Instruction Acts. Nevertheless the report of the majority of\r\nthe commissioners pointed unmistakably towards the solution adopted in\r\nthe act of 1902, and their definite recommendation that voluntary\r\nschools should be accorded rate-aid without the imposition of the\r\nCowper-Temple clause, served as the basis of that legislation. The\r\ncommission brought into strong relief the opposing currents of thought\r\nin educational politics, the majority report, representing the\r\nprinciples of denominationalism, being balanced by a strong minority\r\nreport embodying the views of those who looked for progress along the\r\nlines of the school-board system. Taken together, the two reports form a\r\ncomprehensive survey of the difficulties which still in the main beset\r\npublic education in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Elementary Education Act 1891.\r\n\r\nOf the developments which followed the Cross report, it is convenient to\r\nmention in the first place, out of chronological sequence, the practical\r\nestablishment of free education by the act of 1891, not by the absolute\r\nprohibition of school fees but by the device of a special grant payable\r\nby parliament in lieu of fees, called the fee grant. The result of this\r\nlegislation and of subsequent administrative action was to place free\r\neducation within the reach of every child, fees being retained (with few\r\nexceptions) only where some instruction of a higher elementary type was\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Education other than elementary.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of county councils by the Local Government Act 1888\r\nintroduced a new factor which was destined to exert a determining\r\ninfluence upon subsequent developments of public education. In the first\r\nplace, it at once rendered possible the partial and experimental\r\nprovision for higher education attempted by the Technical Instruction\r\nActs, which affected secondary education as well as technical education\r\nin the proper sense of the term. In order to understand the state of\r\nsecondary education at this period, it is necessary to refer back to the\r\nfirst attempts made to deal with secondary education a generation\r\nearlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Public Schools Commission, 1861.\r\n\r\nIn 1861, that is to say, nearly thirty years after the state began to\r\nconcern itself with elementary education, the first step in the way of\r\nintervention in what is now called secondary or intermediate education\r\nwas taken by the appointment of a royal commission, presided over by\r\nLord Clarendon, to inquire into the condition of nine of the chief\r\nendowed schools in the country, viz. Eton, Winchester, Westminster,\r\nCharterhouse, St Paul's, Merchant Taylors, Harrow, Rugby and Shrewsbury.\r\nThe report of this commission led to a statute, the Public Schools Act\r\nof 1864, which introduced certain reforms in the administration of seven\r\nof these schools, leaving the two great London day schools, St Paul's\r\nand Merchant Taylors, outside its operation. The results achieved were\r\nseen to be important enough to call for a further and much wider\r\ninquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Schools Inquiry Commission, 1864-68.\r\n\r\nAccordingly in 1864 the Schools Inquiry Commission was appointed under\r\nthe presidency of Lord Taunton to inquire into all the schools which had\r\nnot been included either in the commission of 1861 or the Popular\r\nEducation Commission of 1858. It included several men of eminent\r\ndistinction, such as Dr Temple (afterwards archbishop of Canterbury), Mr\r\nW.E. Forster, Dean Hook, and Sir Stafford Northcote; and it was\r\nsingularly fortunate in its staff of assistant commissioners, among whom\r\nwere numbered Mr James Bryce, Mr Matthew Arnold, and Mr (afterwards Sir\r\nJoshua) Fitch. It thoroughly explored the field of secondary education,\r\ndiscussing all the problems, administrative and pedagogic, which the\r\nsubject presents, and \"its luminous and exhaustive report\" (to quote the\r\nwords of Mr Bryce's Commission of 1894) remains the best introduction to\r\nthe problem of public secondary education in England. The existence of\r\nnumerous and frequently very wealthy endowments arising from private\r\nbenefactions and bequests has at all times been a feature in education\r\nas in other departments of English social life. In the organization of\r\nsecondary education in particular, private endowments have played and\r\ncontinue still to play a part which cannot be paralleled in any other\r\ncountry. This circumstance has undoubtedly resulted in a great economy\r\nof resources, though in numerous instances the difficulties occasioned\r\nby the haphazard distribution of endowments and the local jealousies\r\ninvariably aroused by any attempt to readjust their areas to modern\r\nconditions have obstructed useful reform and proved a source of\r\nmisdirected and wasted effort. At the date of the Schools Inquiry\r\nCommission the state of the ancient endowments was largely one of abuse.\r\nVery many endowments intended for advanced education were applied for\r\ninstruction of a purely elementary character, and that of an inferior\r\nkind; indeed the possession of an endowment in a rural locality not\r\ninfrequently operated to prevent the establishment of an efficient\r\nstate-aided school. The evidence showed that the proportion of scholars\r\nin the country grammar-schools who were receiving some tincture of the\r\nclassical education intended by the founders was steadily decreasing,\r\nand nothing had been done to bring the curriculum into harmony with the\r\nactual needs of the time. No doubt a small elite of classical scholars\r\nwere sent to the older universities by these schools, but in the main\r\nthey were in a feeble and decadent state, giving, more or less\r\ninefficiently, an education wholly unsuited to the wants of the class to\r\nwhom they ministered. In addition to the general inelasticity of the\r\ncurriculum, the special evils from which the grammar-schools suffered\r\nwere the want of effective governing bodies and the freehold tenure of\r\nthe headmasterships.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Endowed Schools Acts 1869-74.\r\n\r\nThe commission was singularly successful in bringing about the reform of\r\nthese abuses, its report being immediately followed in 1869 by the\r\nEndowed Schools Act, which was based upon its recommendations and\r\nconferred upon a special commission (united in 1874 with the Charity\r\nCommission) very wide and drastic powers of reorganizing ancient\r\nendowments. A direction for extending the benefits of endowments to\r\ngirls did much to assist the movement for the secondary education of\r\ngirls. The Endowed Schools Acts 1869-1874 introduced modifications of\r\nimportance and general interest into the law of trusts. Under the\r\nexisting rules of the court of chancery, which rules were also binding\r\nupon the Charity Commissioners, educational endowments were generally\r\ntreated, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, as subject to a\r\ntrust for instruction in the doctrines of the Church of England. Under\r\nthe Endowed Schools Acts the presumption is reversed, and ancient trusts\r\nare treated as free from denominational restrictions, save in virtue of\r\nexpress conditions imposed by or under the authority of the founder. The\r\nresult was that in framing schemes for the reorganization of ancient\r\nendowed schools the commissioners found themselves able to treat the\r\nmajority of cases as undenominational. In such cases the general\r\npractice was to direct that instruction should, subject to a strict\r\nconscience clause, be given in the principles of the Christian faith;\r\nthis provision corresponded in a way to the Cowper-Temple clause in\r\nelementary education, with the important distinction that it was\r\npositive, not negative, and did not exclude special doctrinal\r\ninstruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Schools Inquiry Commission's proposals for reform of secondary\r\n  education.\r\n\r\nBesides the recommendations for the reform of endowed schools, to which\r\nsubstantial effect was given directly or indirectly by means of the\r\nEndowed Schools Acts, the Schools Inquiry Commission also submitted\r\nproposals for the general administrative organization of a system of\r\nsecondary education. They recommended the establishment of three\r\nauthorities--(1) a central authority; (2) a local or provincial\r\nauthority, representing the county or a group of counties, with a\r\ncertain jurisdiction both in proposing schemes for the reform of endowed\r\nschools in their area (such as that afterwards conferred upon the joint\r\neducation committees under the Welsh Intermediate Education Act), and in\r\nadministering these schools; and (3) a central council of education\r\ncharged with examination duties. Further, it was proposed to raise the\r\nlevel of proprietary and private schools by offering them inspection and\r\nexamination and by establishing a system of school registration. Lastly,\r\nin order that the supply of public secondary schools might not be\r\ndependent upon endowments, it was proposed to confer upon towns and\r\nparishes powers of rating for the establishment of new schools. For\r\nthese proposals as a whole the time was not ripe. The bill of 1869 as\r\noriginally introduced in the House of Commons attempted to give effect,\r\nwith some variations, to one of these suggestions, namely, that for the\r\ncreation of a central council, but exigencies of parliamentary time made\r\nit necessary to drop this part of the measure; the result was that the\r\nplan of the commissioners was only half carried out. Nevertheless, owing\r\nto the multiplicity and wealth of endowments, the work accomplished was\r\nsufficient to exert a considerable influence upon the secondary\r\neducation of the country. Thus in 1895 Mr Bryce's Commission was able to\r\nreport that schemes under the Endowed Schools Acts had been made for 902\r\nendowments in England, excluding Wales and Monmouth, leaving only 546\r\nendowments out of the total of 1448 endowments in England known to be\r\nsubject to the Endowed Schools Acts, which had not felt the reforming\r\nhand of the commissioners. The total income of the endowments known to\r\nbe Subject to the Endowed Schools Acts, and therefore available for\r\npurposes of secondary education, according to the estimate of the\r\nSecondary Education Commission (still in 1909 the latest available\r\nsource of complete information), was in 1895 about L735,000 gross.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Technical Instruction Acts 1889, &c.\r\n\r\nTwenty years after the Schools Inquiry Commission the creation by the\r\nLocal Government Act in 1888 of the representative and popular county\r\nauthorities of which the need had been felt by reformers alike in\r\nsecondary and elementary education, rendered the first step in the\r\ndirection of the municipalization of secondary instruction at last\r\npossible. In 1889 the Technical Instruction Act (extended in some\r\nparticulars by an act of 1891) empowered the councils of counties,\r\nboroughs and urban districts to levy a rate (not exceeding a penny in\r\nthe pound) for the support or aid of technical or manual instruction.\r\nComparatively few councils were prepared to resort to their rating\r\npowers, but progress under these acts was greatly facilitated by the\r\nLocal Taxation (Customs and Excise) Act of 1890, which mentioned\r\ntechnical instruction as one of the purposes to which the imperial\r\ncontribution paid to local authorities in respect of the beer and spirit\r\nduties might be applied. By virtue of the very liberal interpretation\r\ngiven to technical instruction by these acts the financial assistance\r\nafforded under them was extended to cover the whole field of\r\nmathematical and physical science, as well as modern languages.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Grants of science and art department.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Science and Art acted as an agency in the development\r\nof secondary education upon the same lines as the Technical Instruction\r\nActs, administering a parliamentary grant which was gradually extended\r\nwith a view to encouraging literary studies as well as the scientific\r\nand mathematical subjects to the promotion of which it was primarily\r\ndirected. Thus the combined effect of the local resources available\r\nunder the Technical Instruction Act and the imperial grant administered\r\nby the department was gradually to develop a national system of\r\nsecondary education with a marked bias on the side of physical science.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Influence of new university colleges.\r\n\r\nAn undoubted stimulus was given to secondary education in the great\r\ncentres of industry during the last quarter of the 19th century by the\r\nrise of the new university colleges, among which must be reckoned those\r\nestablished expressly for women. In the main the influence of these new\r\ninstitutions made for a non-classical and scientific type of curriculum\r\nin the popular secondary schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Influence of school boards.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the pressure of the school boards influenced secondary\r\neducation in two ways. In the first place, the elementary schools were\r\nfound to act as feeders for schools of a higher type, and the idea of\r\nthe \"educational ladder\" began to play a leading part in plans for the\r\norganization of national education. It was seen that there must be\r\nschools to which the more advanced scholars could pass from the public\r\nelementary schools, and scholarships to assist such scholars to continue\r\ntheir education in this way. In the next place, it was recognized that\r\nto provide adequately for the further education of public elementary\r\nscholars a new type of school was required. Thus there came into being\r\nthrough the initiative of the great school boards what were known as\r\nhigher-grade elementary schools. These were really secondary schools of\r\nthe third grade, and, as the Commission on Secondary Education observed,\r\nthe school boards simply stepped in to fill the educational void which\r\nthe Schools Inquiry Commissioners had proposed to fill by schools of\r\nthat name. The happy obscurity of the legal definition of elementary\r\neducation left these schools free to develop during the long years of\r\nthe neglect of secondary education by the state, and when in 1901 the\r\nfamous judgment in the test case of _Rex_ v. _Cockerton_ pronounced them\r\nto be illegal, it was at once recognized that the legislature must\r\nwithout delay step in to secure the educational work which the\r\nundoubtedly correct principles of judicial interpretation had placed in\r\njeopardy.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Secondary Education Commission, 1894.\r\n\r\nSuch were the agencies at work in the domain of secondary education when\r\nin 1894 a royal commission was appointed under the presidency of Mr\r\nBryce to inquire into this branch of education. The terms of reference\r\nexcluded elementary education, and the report may be taken as embodying\r\nthe views of that school of educational statesmen who held that progress\r\nwould best be attained by keeping elementary and secondary education\r\nentirely separate for purposes of local administration, the parish being\r\nregarded as the natural unit for elementary and the county for secondary\r\neducation, a topic to which it will be necessary to revert in connexion\r\nwith the act of 1902. The principal recommendations of the commission\r\nwere: (1) the unification of the existing central authorities, viz. the\r\nDepartment of Science and Art, the Charity Commission (so far as it\r\ndealt with educational endowments), and the Education Department, in one\r\ncentral office, and the establishment of an educational council to\r\nadvise the minister of education in certain professional matters; (2)\r\nthe establishment of local authorities, to consist of committees of the\r\ncounty councils with co-opted elements; (3) the formation of a register\r\nof teachers with a view to the encouragement of professional training,\r\nand a system of school registration upon the basis of inspection and\r\nexamination. The first of these recommendations was carried out by the\r\nBoard of Education Act 1899, as mentioned below, and under the same act\r\nan attempt was made to give some effect to the third-named object,\r\nwhich, though it unfortunately fell short of success, may serve as a\r\npoint of departure for further efforts. The realization of the second,\r\nand the most important, of the recommendations was deferred till 1902,\r\nwhen it was brought about as a part of a wider reorganization of the\r\neducational system.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Agitation on behalf of voluntary schools.\r\n\r\nThe religious difficulty in elementary education during the period\r\nimmediately succeeding the report of Mr Bryce's Commission in 1895 once\r\nmore reached an acute stage, and this circumstance was immediately\r\nunfavourable to a resolute handling of educational problems as such,\r\npublic attention being largely concentrated upon the demand of the\r\nsupporters of voluntary schools for relief from the growing financial\r\nburden which was laid upon them by that steady raising of the standard\r\nto which reference has been made above. In 1896 an endeavour was made to\r\nmeet the demands of the voluntary managers by means of a bill introduced\r\nby Sir John Gorst on behalf of the Conservative government. This bill\r\nwith its provision for a special aid grant to be administered by county\r\neducation authorities, which were to exist side by side with the school\r\nboards, represented a kind of compromise between the systems of 1870 and\r\n1902. It encountered opposition in all quarters and was withdrawn. In\r\n1897, however, the position of the denominational schools was\r\nstrengthened by the Voluntary Schools Act, which provided for a special\r\naid grant of five shillings per head of the scholars in average\r\nattendance in these schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Board of Education Act 1899.\r\n\r\nIn view of the difficulties which beset any comprehensive treatment of\r\nthe education question, partial effect was given to the recommendations\r\nof the Secondary Education Commission by the Board of Education Act of\r\n1899, which abolished the office of vice-president of the council,\r\nunited the Department of Science and Art with the Education Department\r\nin one central office under the title of the Board of Education, with a\r\npresident and parliamentary secretary; and provided for the transfer to\r\nthis board of the powers of the Charity Commissioners in relation to\r\neducational endowments; also for the association with the board of a\r\nconsultative committee, consisting as to not less than two-thirds of\r\npersons qualified to represent the views of university and other bodies\r\ninterested in education, for the purpose (1) of framing a register of\r\nqualified teachers, and (2) of advising the Board of Education upon any\r\nmatters referred to the committee by the board. The administrative\r\nreorganization of the Education Office was completed shortly after the\r\npassing of the act of 1902, when a tripartite division was adopted to\r\ncorrespond with the three branches of education with which the Board of\r\nEducation is concerned, viz. elementary, secondary and technological.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Act of 1902, general principles.\r\n\r\nNo law of recent years has excited an acuter or more prolonged\r\ncontroversy than the Education Act of 1902, and amid the dust of\r\nreligious and political strife it is not easy for contemporaries to view\r\nit objectively and in its true proportions. Nevertheless, considered\r\nhistorically, the act becomes intelligible as the product of the forces,\r\npartly religious and partly educational, which have been already\r\ndescribed. The immediate impulse for this measure must be sought in the\r\nagitation that during the preceding decade had been gathering force\r\namong the adherents of the Established and Roman Catholic churches for\r\nequality of financial treatment as between voluntary and board schools.\r\nIt must be placed to the credit of the constructive statesmanship of the\r\nConservative party that it availed itself of an ecclesiastical agitation\r\nto take an important step forward in the organization of national\r\neducation. The difficulty inherent in such a measure was the admitted\r\ndifficulty of securing public control, as a necessary concomitant of\r\npublic maintenance, without jeopardizing or destroying the special\r\nreligious character of the voluntary schools. The act of 1902 sought to\r\nsolve this problem, so difficult of solution under democratic\r\nconditions, upon the principle of a division of financial responsibility\r\njustifying a corresponding division of control between the voluntary\r\nmanagers and the local authority. The constitution of the local\r\nauthority to be charged not only with the delicate duty of participating\r\nin the dual control of the voluntary public elementary schools, but also\r\nwith the responsible task of co-ordinating public higher with public\r\nelementary education, presented features of controversy only less\r\nformidable than the purely religious question itself. Boldly reversing\r\nthe settlement of 1870, the act of 1902 abolished the parochial school\r\nboards, and with them the system of _ad hoc_ election, and made the\r\ncounty councils, already seised of technical and secondary education\r\nunder the Technical Instruction Acts, the local authorities for all\r\nforms of education, thus reverting to the solution propounded by\r\nConservative statesmanship in the middle period of the 19th century and\r\nendorsed by an important memorandum contributed by Lord Sandford\r\n(formerly permanent secretary of the Education Department) to the report\r\nof the Cross Commission. The unquestionable niggardliness and\r\ninefficiency of many small country school boards, which had been\r\nforetold by the prescience of the Newcastle Commissioners, constituted\r\nthe chief educational argument for the selection of the wider area so\r\nfar as the interests of elementary education alone were concerned. On\r\nthe other hand, experience has shown that in the rural districts against\r\nthe undoubted gain in general efficiency there must be set a certain\r\nloss on account of the decay of local and personal interest consequent\r\nupon the centralization of authority in the hands of the county\r\ncouncils. Account, too, must be taken of the comparative heaviness with\r\nwhich a uniform county rate is apt to press upon sparsely populated\r\nagricultural parishes, especially in counties which include considerable\r\nindustrial districts. Notwithstanding these minor drawbacks, it may be\r\nsaid that upon the whole the best opinion has endorsed the policy of\r\n1902 with respect to the area of administration. At any rate it has been\r\nnecessary to recognize the impracticability of disestablishing the\r\nstrongly organized provincial authorities which the act brought into\r\nbeing, and proposals for amendment in this particular have been\r\nconfined to schemes, favoured in principle by all parties, for securing\r\nsome measure of decentralization and delegation of powers calculated to\r\nrestore and stimulate local interest without derogating from the\r\nfinancial and administrative responsibility of the county council.\r\n\r\nThe principal provisions of the act of 1902 may be summarized as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Act of 1902, summary of provisions.\r\n\r\n  Part I. Local Education Authority. The council of every county and of\r\n  every county borough is the local education authority for the purposes\r\n  of the act, i.e. for both higher and elementary education, but for the\r\n  purpose of elementary education autonomous powers are conferred upon\r\n  boroughs with a population of over 10,000, and urban districts with a\r\n  population of over 20,000 (S 1).\r\n\r\n  Part II. Higher Education. \"The L.E.A. (local education authority)\r\n  shall consider the educational needs of their area and take such steps\r\n  as seem to them desirable, after consultation with the Board of\r\n  Education, to supply or aid the supply of education other than\r\n  elementary, and to promote the general co-ordination of all forms of\r\n  education.\" For this purpose the application of the money received by\r\n  the local authority under the Local Taxation (Customs and Excise) Act\r\n  1890, heretofore optional, is made compulsory, and power is given to\r\n  levy a rate which in the case of a county is not to exceed two pence\r\n  in the pound, or such higher rate as the county council with the\r\n  consent of the Local Government Board may fix (S 2). Concurrent powers\r\n  are given to the councils of non-county boroughs and urban districts,\r\n  with the limit of a penny rate (S 3). A council must not require any\r\n  particular form of religious instruction or observance, but the usual\r\n  conscience clause in schools, colleges, or hostels provided by the\r\n  council is modified by a provision for facilities for any particular\r\n  religious instruction to be given at the request of parents of\r\n  scholars at such times and under such conditions as the council think\r\n  desirable, otherwise than at the cost of the council (S 4).\r\n\r\n  Part III. Elementary Education. (1) Powers and duties. School boards\r\n  and school attendance committees are abolished and their powers and\r\n  duties are transferred to the L.E.A., who are also to be responsible\r\n  for and have the control of all secular instruction in public\r\n  elementary schools not provided by them (S 5).\r\n\r\n  (2) Management of schools. (a) For public elementary schools provided\r\n  by the L.E.A. (now officially styled \"council schools\"): (1) in\r\n  counties, there is to be a body of six managers, viz. four appointed\r\n  by the county council and two by the borough or urban district\r\n  council, or parish council or parish meeting as the case may be,\r\n  called in the act the minor local authority; (2) in non-county areas,\r\n  the L.E.A. (being the borough or urban district council) may, if they\r\n  think fit, appoint a body of managers consisting of such number as\r\n  they may determine (S 6 [1]).\r\n\r\n  (b) For schools not provided by the L.E.A. (voluntary schools) the act\r\n  directs that there shall be a body of six managers, of whom four are\r\n  to be \"foundation managers,\" and two are to be appointed as follows:\r\n  in counties, one by the L.E.A. and one by the minor local authority,\r\n  and in autonomous boroughs or urban districts both by the borough or\r\n  urban district council (S 6 [2]). Directions for the appointment of\r\n  foundation managers are given by S 11, which in effect declares that,\r\n  unless the trust deed of the school provides for the appointment of\r\n  the required number, the foundation managers must be appointed under\r\n  an order of the Board of Education, in making which the board are to\r\n  have regard to the ownership of the school building and to the\r\n  principles on which the education given in the school had been\r\n  conducted in the past. It was found necessary for the board to make\r\n  over 11,000 of these orders, a heavy task which was rendered the more\r\n  formidable by the controversial character of the questions arising\r\n  upon trust deeds as to the mode of appointment and the qualifications\r\n  of managers.\r\n\r\n  (3) Maintenance of schools (S 7). (a) Powers. The L.E.A. are required\r\n  to maintain and keep efficient all public elementary schools which\r\n  were necessary (i.e. which, as defined by S 9, have an average\r\n  attendance of not less than thirty), under certain specified\r\n  conditions, of which the most material are as follows. The managers\r\n  must carry out the directions of the L.E.A. as to the secular\r\n  instruction to be given in the school, including any directions with\r\n  respect to the number and educational qualifications of the teachers,\r\n  and for the dismissal of any teacher on educational grounds (S 7 [1]\r\n  [a]). The consent of the L.E.A. is required to the appointment of\r\n  teachers, but that consent may not be withheld except on educational\r\n  grounds; and the consent of the authority is also required to the\r\n  dismissal of a teacher unless the dismissal is on grounds connected\r\n  with the giving of religious instruction (S7 [1] [c]).\r\n\r\n  (b) Liabilities. The managers are required to provide the school\r\n  premises to the L.E.A. for use as a public elementary school free of\r\n  charge, except that a rent is payable for the teacher's residence\r\n  where one exists; and the managers are further required out of funds\r\n  provided by them to keep the school premises in good repair and to\r\n  make such alterations and improvements in the buildings as might\r\n  reasonably be required by the L.E.A. On the other hand, the L.E.A. are\r\n  required to make good such damage as they consider to be due to fair\r\n  wear and tear of rooms used by them (S 7 [1] [d]). Thus, by virtue of\r\n  the teacher's house rent and the wear-and-tear allowance the voluntary\r\n  managers secured a valuable set-off against the cost of ordinary\r\n  repairs.\r\n\r\n  Any question arising under this section (S 7) between the L.E.A. and\r\n  the managers of a voluntary school is to be determined by the Board of\r\n  Education (S 7 [3]).\r\n\r\n  It is further provided with respect to teachers in voluntary schools\r\n  that assistant teachers and pupil teachers may be appointed \"if it is\r\n  thought fit\" without reference to religious creed and denomination,\r\n  and in any case in which there are more candidates for the post of\r\n  pupil teacher than there are places to be filled, the appointment is\r\n  to be made by the L.E.A. (S 7. [5]).\r\n\r\n  A provision, S 7 (6), known from the name of its author (d. 1908),\r\n  Colonel Kenyon Slaney, M.P., as the Kenyon-Slaney clause, attracted\r\n  considerable attention and formed the subject of much ecclesiastical\r\n  controversy during the passage of the bill through parliament. The\r\n  Kenyon-Slaney clause requires the religious instruction in voluntary\r\n  schools to be in accordance with the provisions (if any) of the trust\r\n  deed, but also to be under the control of the managers as a whole,\r\n  whereas the common form of trust deed of the National Society reserves\r\n  the control of religious instruction to the clergyman, whilst the\r\n  clause was equally in conflict with the well-known sacerdotal\r\n  principles of the Roman Catholic Church. Thus the clause represented a\r\n  revival, as did the questions with respect to foundation managers, of\r\n  the early controversy over the management clauses of the Committee of\r\n  Council on Education. Its special interest lies, not so much in its\r\n  intrinsic importance, as in the precedent it affords, specially\r\n  notable as emanating from a Conservative source, for the overruling of\r\n  trust deeds upon grounds of public policy. By way of saving another\r\n  familiar provision of the trust deeds, a proviso to the Kenyon-Slaney\r\n  clause reserves the existing trust-deed rights of appeal to the bishop\r\n  or other denominational authority as to the character of the religious\r\n  instruction.\r\n\r\n  _Provision of New Schools._--New schools may be provided either by the\r\n  L.E.A. or any other persons, subject to the issue of three months'\r\n  public notice, and to a right of appeal on the part of the managers of\r\n  any existing school, the L.E.A. (in the case of proposed voluntary\r\n  schools) or any ten ratepayers of the district, to the Board of\r\n  Education on the ground that the proposed school is not required, or\r\n  that a school provided by the L.E.A., or not so provided, as the case\r\n  might be, is better suited to meet the wants of the district than the\r\n  proposed school. Any enlargement of a public elementary school which\r\n  in the opinion of the Board of Education is such as to amount to the\r\n  provision of a new school is to be so treated for the purposes of the\r\n  section, and any transfer of a school to or from the L.E.A. must be\r\n  treated as the provision of a new school. In deciding appeals as to\r\n  new schools and in determining a case of dispute whether a school was\r\n  necessary or not, the board are directed to have regard to the\r\n  interest of secular instruction, the wishes of parents as to the\r\n  education of children, and the economy of the rates, but existing\r\n  schools are not to be considered unnecessary if the average attendance\r\n  is not less than thirty (SS 8-9). The last-mentioned canons have\r\n  played a prominent part in subsequent discussions. Experience of these\r\n  sections has shown that though it is extremely difficult to set up new\r\n  voluntary schools in face of opposition from the L.E.A., such\r\n  opposition is rarely offered or pressed where any really strong local\r\n  demand is shown to exist.\r\n\r\n  _Aid Grant._--Section 10 provides a new aid grant payable to the\r\n  L.E.A. in respect of the number of scholars in average attendance in\r\n  schools maintained by them. This new grant, calculated by an elaborate\r\n  method which need not here be set out, took the place of the grants\r\n  under the Voluntary Schools Act 1897, and S 97 of the act of 1870 as\r\n  amended by the Elementary Education Act 1897.\r\n\r\n  _Education Committees._--The constitution of education committees is\r\n  dealt with by S 17. All councils having powers under the act, except\r\n  those having concurrent powers as to higher education only, must\r\n  establish education committees in accordance with schemes made by the\r\n  councils and approved by the Board of Education (S 17 [1]). A scheme\r\n  may provide for more than one education committee under a single\r\n  council, but before approving such a scheme the board must satisfy\r\n  themselves that due regard is paid to the importance of the general\r\n  co-ordination of all forms of education (S 17 [6]). All matters\r\n  relating to the exercise by a council of their powers under the act,\r\n  except the power of raising a rate or borrowing money, stand referred\r\n  to the education committee; the council may also delegate to the\r\n  education committee any of their powers other than financial powers as\r\n  above (S 17 [2]). Every scheme must provide (a) for the appointment of\r\n  a majority of the committee by the council, the persons so appointed\r\n  to be persons who are members of the council unless in the case of a\r\n  county the council otherwise determine; (b) for the appointment by the\r\n  council, on the nomination or recommendation, where it appears\r\n  desirable, of other bodies (including associations of voluntary\r\n  schools) of persons of experience in education, and of persons\r\n  acquainted with the needs of the various kinds of schools in the area\r\n  of the council; (c) for the inclusion of women. Provision was also\r\n  made (d) for the representation in the first instance of members of\r\n  existing school boards (S 17 [3]).\r\n\r\n  _Expenses._--All parliamentary grants are made payable to the L.E.A.\r\n  instead of as previously to the managers (S 18 [2]). The county\r\n  council must charge a proportion of all capital expenditure and\r\n  liabilities, including rent, on account of the provision or\r\n  improvement of any public elementary school on the parish or parishes\r\n  which in the opinion of the council are served by the school, such\r\n  proportion to be not less than one-half or more than three-fourths as\r\n  the council think fit (S 18 [1] [c] [d]). The county council may also\r\n  if they think fit charge on the parishes benefited any expenses\r\n  incurred with respect to education other than elementary (S 18 [1]\r\n  [a]).\r\n\r\n  _Endowments._--The act introduced a new principle into the\r\n  administration of endowments by directing that their income so far as\r\n  necessarily applicable in any case for those purposes of a public\r\n  elementary school for which the local authority are liable must be\r\n  paid to that authority for the relief of the parochial rate (S 13). As\r\n  the result of technicalities of legal interpretation the section has\r\n  been found to have in practice a narrower scope than had been\r\n  generally anticipated.\r\n\r\n  The act of 1902 was extended to London by a separate act in 1903,\r\n  containing certain special provisions of only minor importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Passive resistance\" to 1902 act. Default Act 1904.\r\n\r\nThe hostility of Nonconformists to the extension of rate-aid to\r\ndenominational schools led to the organization upon a considerable scale\r\nof what became known as the \"Passive Resistance\" movement, a number of\r\nNonconformist rate-payers refusing to pay the education rate on the\r\nground that their consciences forbade their supporting the religious\r\nteaching in denominational schools; and their willingness to become\r\nsubject to distraint and consequent inconveniences rather than pay the\r\nrates became the foundation of a widespread political campaign. In\r\nWales, where in the rural districts the schools were commonly Anglican\r\nwhilst the population was Nonconformist, particular difficulties arose\r\nin administering the act in consequence of the hostile attitude of the\r\ncounty authorities. Friction likewise manifested itself in one or two\r\nEnglish areas, which reflected militant Nonconformist views. Accordingly\r\nthe government passed the Local Education (Local Authority Default) Act\r\n1904, empowering the Board of Education, in the case of default by the\r\nlocal authority, to make payments direct to the managers of the school\r\nand to deduct the amount from the sums payable to the defaulting\r\nauthority on account of parliamentary grants.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Bill of 1906.\r\n\r\nWhen the liberal party came into power again in 1906, Mr Birrell as\r\npresident of the Board of Education in Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman's\r\nadministration introduced a bill to amend the Education Acts 1902-1903,\r\nwith the object of securing full public control of all rate-aided\r\nschools and the appointment of teachers without reference to religious\r\nbelief. The bill was of a highly complex character; its principal\r\nfeatures were,--compulsory transfer of existing voluntary schools to the\r\nlocal authority, facilities for the giving of denominational instruction\r\nin transferred schools out of school hours by persons other than the\r\nregular teachers, and the recognition in populous districts, upon the\r\ndemand of parents, of special publicly maintained schools in which\r\ndenominational teaching could be included in the curriculum; the latter\r\nschools might (according to the bill as finally amended) in the last\r\nresort, i.e. if the local authority refused to maintain them, be\r\nrecognized as state-aided schools. The bill encountered strong\r\nopposition from Anglicans and Catholics (though the Catholic Irish\r\nmembers finally voted for it as amended); it passed the House of Commons\r\nby a large majority, but after unavailing attempts at compromise upon\r\nthe amendments introduced in the House of Lords, the two Houses failed\r\nto agree and the measure was lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Bills of 1908.\r\n\r\nMr Birrell was soon transferred to another office, and nothing more was\r\ndone to amend the act of 1902 till early in the session of 1908, his\r\nsuccessor Mr McKenna introduced a bill based on what was known as\r\n\"contracting out.\" In single-school parishes the existing schools were\r\nto be compulsorily transferred, subject to the grant of denominational\r\nfacilities out of school hours; elsewhere a sufficiency of places in\r\nschools with Cowper-Temple teaching, which the bill proposed to make\r\ncompulsory in all provided schools, must be supplied by the local\r\nauthority, while existing voluntary schools might become state-aided\r\nschools upon terms of receiving a grant of 47s. per head. The bill was\r\naccompanied by a financial scheme for a new system of allocating the\r\nparliamentary grant. In view of the improbability of its passing into\r\nlaw the bill was not pressed beyond the stage of second reading.\r\nMeanwhile, when Mr Asquith reorganized the cabinet, Mr Runciman\r\nsucceeded Mr McKenna at the education office, and in the autumn he\r\nintroduced a fresh measure framed as the result of negotiations between\r\nthe government and the archbishop of Canterbury (Dr Randall Davidson)\r\nand designed to be passed rapidly through parliament by consent of all\r\nparties. Mr Runciman's bill, like his predecessor's, was based upon the\r\nprinciple of compulsory transfer in single-school parishes and\r\ncontracting out elsewhere, but it gave a right of entry for\r\ndenominational teaching on two days a week during school hours in all\r\ncouncil schools whether transferred voluntary schools or otherwise, with\r\nliberty to employ for this purpose assistant teachers, but not (save\r\ntemporarily at first in transferred schools) head teachers. Provision\r\nwas also made for the payment of a small rent which would be applicable\r\nfor or towards the cost of the denominational instruction.\r\nUnfortunately, the compromise failed at the last moment for want of\r\nagreement as to the financial terms of \"contracting out,\" the government\r\noffering 50s. per head and the Church demanding 7s. more. It is obvious\r\nthat \"contracting out\" is open to serious objection upon educational and\r\neconomic grounds, and that if resorted to upon any very considerable\r\nscale it would involve a disruption of the public elementary system, and\r\na duplication of schools which would constitute a wasteful drain upon\r\nthe national exchequer. Upon such a system, therefore, some check is\r\nnecessary, and, once decided that the check should take the form of\r\nfinancial pressure, rather than request of parents as in Mr Birrell's\r\nbill, or some form of administrative control, the question of pecuniary\r\nterms became one of principle and not merely of financial detail.\r\nMoreover, the difficulty of adjusting differences was intensified by the\r\nopposition of the extremists on either side, which daily gathered force,\r\nand the bill was withdrawn by the government when in committee of the\r\nHouse of Commons. The conciliatory efforts of Mr Runciman and Dr Randall\r\nDavidson revealed the existence of a considerable body of influential\r\nopinion among all schools of thought in favour of a national compromise,\r\nand the proposals embodied in the bill marked on the part both of\r\nChurchmen and Nonconformists important concessions to each other's\r\nviews, engendering reasonable hopes of an ultimate settlement being\r\nreached at no distant date.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Feeding of school children.\r\n\r\nTwo subsidiary points as regards educational machinery have to be noted.\r\nThe Education (Provision of Meals) Act 1906 enabled local education\r\nauthorities to aid voluntary agencies in the provision of meals for\r\nchildren attending public elementary schools, and in certain cases with\r\nthe consent of the Board of Education to defray the cost of the food\r\nthemselves. In 1907-1908 forty, and in 1908-1909 seventy-five\r\nauthorities in England and Wales were authorized by the board to expend\r\nmoneys from the rates on food under this act. In addition, a number of\r\nauthorities expended funds on equipment and service.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Medical inspection.\r\n\r\nIn 1907 an uncontroversial act entitled the Education (Administrative\r\nProvisions) Act, besides dealing with various matters of technical and\r\nadministrative detail, laid upon local education authorities the new\r\nduty of providing for the medical inspection of all children attending\r\npublic elementary schools. In connexion with this act the Board of\r\nEducation established a medical department to advise and assist them in\r\nsupervising local education authorities in carrying out their statutory\r\nduties in this regard. The whole departure is significant of the new\r\nsense of the importance of physical culture and hygiene which has been\r\none of the remarkable features in recent educational developments.\r\n\r\n\r\n  General progress in elementary education.\r\n\r\nSir Joshua Fitch, in his article on education in the 10th edition of\r\nthis work, describes how experience had led the Education Department to\r\nabandon the system of payment by results, to establish \"in place of\r\ntesting the proficiency of individual scholars,... one summary estimate\r\nof the work of the school; in place of an annual examination, occasional\r\ninspection without notice; in place of a variable grant dependent on a\r\nreport in detail on the several subjects of instruction and on\r\nparticular educational merits and defects, one block grant payable to\r\nall schools alike.\" He at the same time expressed some misgiving as to\r\nthe effect of \"so large a relaxation of the conditions by which it had\r\nhitherto been sought to secure accuracy and thoroughness in teaching.\"\r\nThe act of 1902, by placing secular education in public elementary\r\nschools under the control of strongly organized local education\r\nauthorities may be said to have largely removed such dangers as were to\r\nbe apprehended from the relaxation in question. Thus it was possible for\r\nthe Board of Education in the code of 1904 to abolish the last traces of\r\nthe system of payment by results, by setting forth (in the language of\r\ntheir report for 1903-1904) \"a properly co-ordinated curriculum suitable\r\nto the needs of the children, with an indication of the relation which\r\nthe various subjects of instruction should bear to each other, in place\r\nof the relatively haphazard list of possible branches of knowledge which\r\nwere formerly presented to the choice of individual schools or\r\nauthorities.\" In the new code also the board for the first time\r\nendeavoured to state for the guidance of teachers and parents the proper\r\naim of the public elementary school, laying stress upon that element of\r\nthe training of character which the system of payment by results had so\r\nunfortunately obscured. The new spirit was strikingly manifested in the\r\nvolume of _Suggestions for the Considerations of Teachers_, issued by\r\nthe Board of Education in 1905. This volume represented a notable\r\nattempt to connect administration with educational theory, without in\r\nany way seeking to crush individual initiative, or to impose a\r\nbureaucratic uniformity of method upon those engaged in the actual work\r\nof the schools. Apprehension of the true aim of elementary education as\r\nessentially and primarily a preparation for practical life has led to a\r\ncorresponding development of instruction of a practical character,\r\nobservation lessons and nature study being treated as a necessary\r\nelement in the curriculum, while handicraft and gardening, and domestic\r\nsubjects (for girls), are encouraged by special grants. Particular\r\nattention has been bestowed both by the central and local authorities\r\nupon the problem of rural instruction, and much has been done in many\r\nareas to bring the schools into closer relations with the needs of\r\nagricultural and rural life generally. In this way the old and perhaps\r\nnot altogether ill-founded distrust of popular education as tending to\r\nunfit the working classes for industrial pursuits is being broken down\r\nand a public opinion more favourable to educational progress in the\r\nwidest sense is being created.\r\n\r\nAccording to the official returns for 1907-1908, the total number of\r\nscholars on the registers (England only) was as follows:--council\r\nschools, 2,991,741; voluntary schools, 2,566,030; total, 5,557,771, and\r\nthe total attendance upon which grant was paid was 4,928,659. The\r\npercentage of actual average attendance to average number on the\r\nregisters was 88.50%. The parliamentary grant (England and Wales) for\r\nelementary schools, other than higher elementary, amounted to\r\nL11,023,433.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Higher elementary schools.\r\n\r\nThe development of higher elementary education in England is now\r\nproceeding very much upon the lines that have been noted in France. The\r\nold higher-grade board-schools (declared illegal under the Elementary\r\nEducation Acts by the judgment in the case of _Rex_ v. _Cockerton_ in\r\n1901, and legalized temporarily by an act passed for the purpose in the\r\nsame year) were mostly converted into municipal secondary schools under\r\nthe act of 1902. In the succeeding years provision was made in the code\r\nfor higher elementary schools of a specialized and technical type\r\nintended only for industrial districts. In 1906, as the result of the\r\nrecommendations of the Consultative Committee, a new type of higher\r\nelementary school was admitted for children over twelve, corresponding\r\ngenerally to the French _ecole primaire superieure_, described as having\r\n\"for its object the development of the education given in the ordinary\r\npublic elementary school, and the provision of special instruction\r\nbearing on the future occupations of the scholars, whether boys or\r\ngirls.\" It may be possible to supplement this system in the rural areas\r\nto some extent by \"higher tops\" to the ordinary elementary schools in\r\ncases where it is not practicable to establish a fully organised higher\r\nelementary school; but for such \"higher tops\" no central grant is\r\navailable. The total number of scholars upon the registers of higher\r\nelementary schools (England) in 1907-1908 was: New Type, 3178 (against\r\n2715 in the previous year); Old Type, 4492 (against 5866 in the previous\r\nyear).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Expenditure on elementary education.\r\n\r\nThe total expenditure (exclusive of capital outlay) of the local\r\nauthorities (1906-1907) in England only upon elementary education,\r\nincluding \"industrial\" and \"special\" schools, was L19,776,733, of which\r\n(a) L10,408,242 was met by the ordinary parliamentary grant, and (b)\r\nL8,930,468 was the balance required to be met by rates, the difference\r\nbeing represented by receipts from various sources. The average cost per\r\nchild of elementary schools in England and Wales (excluding London) may\r\nbe taken at L3 (including London L3, 4s. 10d.), and the average central\r\ngrant (excluding grants for special purposes) at 41s., leaving 19s. to\r\nbe raised locally.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Preliminary training of elementary teachers.\r\n\r\nThe training of teachers for the two great branches of public education,\r\nelementary and secondary respectively, is an important part of the\r\ngeneral administrative problem. Since the middle of the 19th century\r\nthere has been a great development of public opinion with regard to\r\ntheir professional qualifications. Sir Joshua Fitch (_Ency. Brit._ 10th\r\ned.) pointed out that the full appreciation of the importance of\r\ntraining began at the lower end of the social scale. Shuttleworth and\r\nTufnell in 1846 urged the necessity of special training for the primary\r\nteacher, and hoped to establish State Training Colleges to supply this\r\nwant; but the one college at Battersea which was founded as an\r\nexperiment was soon transferred to the National Society (the \"National\r\nSociety for educating the poor in the principles of the Established\r\nChurch\": founded in 1811). Before this, Bell and Lancaster had made\r\narrangements in their model schools for the reception of a few young\r\npeople to learn the system by practice. In Glasgow, David Stow, who\r\nfounded in 1826 the Normal Seminary which afterwards became the Free\r\nChurch College, was one of the first to insist on the need of systematic\r\nprofessional preparation. The religious bodies in England, notably the\r\nEstablished Church, availed themselves promptly of the failure of the\r\ncentral government, and a number of diocesan colleges for men, and\r\nseparately for women, were gradually established. In 1854 the British\r\nand Foreign School Society (founded 1808) placed their institutes at the\r\nBorough Road and Stockwell on a collegiate footing, and subsequently\r\nfounded other colleges at Swansea, Bangor, Darlington and Saffron\r\nWalden; the Roman Catholic Church provided two for women and one for\r\nmen; and the Wesleyans two, one for each sex. The new provincial\r\ncolleges of university rank were invited by the Education Department to\r\nattach normal classes to their ordinary course and to make provision for\r\nspecial training and suitable practice in schools for those students who\r\ndesired to become teachers. Thus the government came to recognize two\r\nkinds of training schools--the residential colleges of the old type and\r\nthe day colleges attached to institutions of university rank; both were\r\nsubsidized by grants from the Treasury, and regularly inspected. As the\r\nneed of special training for teachers became further recognized by the\r\nconsideration of the same question as regards teachers in higher and\r\nintermediate schools (Cambridge instituting in 1879 examinations for a\r\nteacher's diploma, and other universities providing courses for\r\nsecondary as well as primary teachers, and establishing professorships\r\nof education), the attitude of the government, i.e. the Board of\r\nEducation, towards the problem gradually became more and more a subject\r\nof controversy and of public interest, as indicated by the clause in the\r\nAct of 1899 providing for a public registration of qualified teachers\r\nand for the gradual elimination from the profession of those who were\r\nunqualified. And meanwhile the increased solidarity of the National\r\nUnion of Teachers (founded in 1870), the trade union, so to speak, of\r\nthe teachers, brought an important body of professional opinion to bear\r\non the discussion of their own interests.\r\n\r\nThe question of the preliminary education of elementary teachers had\r\nafter some years of discussion reached a critical stage in 1909. The\r\nhistory of pupil teachership as a method of concurrent instruction and\r\nemployment shows that it was in its inception something in the nature of\r\na makeshift; the ideal placed before local education authorities in the\r\nrecent regulations and reports of the Board of Education is the\r\nalternative system whereby with the aid of national bursaries\r\n(instituted in 1907) \"the general education of future teachers may be\r\ncontinued in secondary schools until the age of seventeen or eighteen,\r\nand all attempts to obtain a practical experience of elementary school\r\nwork may be deferred until the training college is entered, or at least\r\nuntil an examination making a natural break in that general education\r\nand qualifying for an admission to a training college has been passed.\"\r\nUnder the revised pupil-teacher system established by the regulations of\r\n1903 provision is made for the instruction of pupil teachers in centres\r\nwhich as far as possible are attached to secondary schools receiving\r\ngrants from the Board of Education under the regulations for secondary\r\nschools, about two-thirds of the secondary schools on the grant list\r\nundertaking this work. Accordingly, the result of recent changes is to\r\nmodify the old system in two ways: first by providing the alternative of\r\na full course of secondary education, secondly by associating pupil\r\nteachership itself as far as possible with part-time attendance at a\r\nsecondary school. The total number of pupil teachers recognized during\r\nthe year 1907-1908 was 20,571, and of these 9770 were in centres forming\r\nintegral parts of secondary schools. The number of bursars who passed\r\nthe leaving examination was 1486.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Training colleges.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal difficulties which confronted the state and the\r\nlocal authorities in their task of organizing an improved system of\r\npublic education under the act of 1902 lay in the deficiency of training\r\ncolleges in view of the increased number of teachers. Local authorities\r\nnaturally hesitated to burden themselves with the cost of providing such\r\ninstitutions in view of the fact that there is nothing to prevent\r\nteachers trained at great expense by one authority taking service under\r\na less public-spirited authority who had contributed nothing to such\r\ntraining; hence a widespread feeling that the provision of training\r\ncolleges should be undertaken by the state as a matter of national\r\nconcern. Under these circumstances a new system of building grants in\r\naid of the establishment of training colleges was instituted in 1905. In\r\n1906 these grants were raised from 25 to 75% of the capital expenditure,\r\nbut were limited to colleges provided by local authorities. A further\r\ndifficulty in view of the municipalization of education arose from the\r\nfact that the majority of the residential colleges were in the hands of\r\ndenominational trusts which did not admit a conscience clause. Under the\r\npresidency of Mr McKenna in 1907, the Board of Education, in regulations\r\nwhich excited much controversy, \"with a view to throwing open as far as\r\npossible the advantages of a course of training in colleges supported\r\nmainly by public funds to all students who are qualified to profit by it\r\nirrespective of religious creed or social status,\" laid down that the\r\napplication of a candidate might in no circumstances be rejected on any\r\nreligious ground, nor on the ground of social antecedents or the like.\r\nThe same regulations provided that no new training colleges would be\r\nrecognized except on terms of compliance with certain conditions as to\r\nfreedom from denominational restrictions or requirements. The obligation\r\nas to religious exemptions has since been limited to 50% of the\r\nadmissions. There were in attendance (_Statistics_, England, 1907-1908)\r\nin the various colleges, 6561 women and 2835 men, of whom 1619 women and\r\n335 men were in colleges provided by local education authorities. The\r\ngrants made by the Board of Education for training colleges were as\r\nfollows: maintenance grants L383,851; building grants L45,000. These\r\nfigures include Wales.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Continuative education.\r\n\r\nThe fear has been widely entertained that a considerable part of the\r\nnational expenditure upon elementary education is wasted for want of an\r\neffective system of continuative instruction to be given out of working\r\nhours to adolescents engaged in industrial employment. The whole subject\r\nwas exhaustively treated by the report in 1909 of the Consultative\r\nCommittee of the Board of Education. This report seeks to base an\r\nefficient continuative system upon the improvement of elementary\r\neducation by reducing the size of the classes in the elementary schools\r\nupon the lines now laid down by the new staffing regulations of 1909; by\r\nincreasing the amount of instruction in hand-work with a view to\r\nrendering the curriculum less bookish and more efficient as a training\r\nfor industrial and agricultural life; and by legislation to reform the\r\nsystem of half-time attendance and raise the age of compulsory\r\nattendance to thirteen and ultimately fourteen. Upon the foundation of\r\nan improved and prolonged elementary education there would be reared a\r\nsuperstructure of continuative schools or classes, attendance at which\r\nup to seventeen would be compulsory under bye-laws adoptive locally at\r\nthe option of the local education authorities. In 1906-1907 about 21 per\r\nthousand of the population of England and Wales attended evening schools\r\nand classes inspected by the Board of Education, and grant amounting to\r\nL361,596 was paid in respect of 440,718 regular attendants.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Secondary education.\r\n\r\nThe most marked progress has undoubtedly been in secondary education,\r\nand in no direction has the act of 1902 proved more fruitful. At the end\r\nof the 19th century secondary instruction in England was still provided\r\nchiefly by endowed grammar-schools, by proprietary schools established\r\nby religious bodies or joint-stock companies, and by private enterprise.\r\nNo public provision was made for secondary education as such; what\r\nfinancial assistance was forthcoming from municipal sources was given\r\nindirectly under cover of the grants under the Technical Instruction\r\nActs, while in the administration of central grants for the first years\r\nof the working of the Board of Education Act 1899, no absolute\r\ndifferentiation between secondary and technological functions was\r\nrecognized. The establishment of local authorities with direct duties in\r\nrespect of secondary education, and the reorganization of the central\r\noffice with reference to the three branches of education, elementary,\r\nsecondary and technological, rendered possible for the first time an\r\nadequate treatment of the problem of public secondary education as a\r\nwhole. \"The regulations for secondary schools,\" says the prefatory\r\nmemorandum to the regulations of the Board of Education, \"grew up round\r\nthe old provisions of the Directory of the Science and Art Department.\r\nDetached science classes were gradually built up into schools of\r\nscience. Schools of science were subsequently widened into schools of\r\nwhat was known as the 'Division A' type, providing a course of\r\ninstruction in science in connexion with, and as part of, a course of\r\ngeneral education. Aid was afterwards extended to schools of the\r\n'Division B' type in which science did not form the preponderating\r\nelement of the instruction given. In 1904 the board recast the\r\nregulations so as to bring all schools aided by grants within the\r\ngeneral definition of a school offering a general education up to and\r\nbeyond the age of sixteen through a complete graded course of\r\ninstruction, the object of which should be to develop all the faculties,\r\nand to form the habit of exercising them.\"\r\n\r\nTwo main tendencies distinguish the recent development: on the one hand\r\nthe tendency to municipalization, or at least to the establishment of\r\npublic control; on the other hand the tendency (marked especially by the\r\nregulations of 1907) to greater elasticity in regard to curricula, and\r\nso to the freer encouragement of local initiative and local effort.\r\n\r\nIn 1907 the government of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman placed greatly\r\nincreased funds at the disposal of the Board of Education for the\r\npurpose of secondary education. The regulations under which the\r\nincreased grant was administered imposed conditions in respect of\r\nfreedom from denominational restrictions or requirements, representative\r\nlocal control, and accessibility to all classes of the people, which,\r\nlike the analogous rules with regard to training colleges, roused\r\nconsiderable controversy. With regard to religious instruction, the\r\nrequirement was made that no catechism or formulary distinctive of any\r\nparticular religious denomination might be taught in the school except\r\nupon the request in writing of the parent or guardian and at the cost of\r\nfunds other than grants of public money. Power was at the same time\r\nreserved to the board to waive the new conditions in the event of the\r\nlocal education authority passing a resolution that the school was in\r\ntheir view required as part of the secondary school provision for their\r\narea, and that the conditions, or one or more of them, might be waived\r\nwith advantage in view of the educational needs of the area. It will be\r\nnoticed that one effect of the regulations (as of the training college\r\nregulations) was to recognize as a kind of established religion those\r\nelements of Christianity which are shared in common by the various\r\nProtestant churches, according to the system of Lancaster and the\r\nCowper-Temple compromise. Normally schools are required to provide 25%\r\nof free places for scholars from public elementary schools, and, with a\r\nview to encouraging the transference of children from the public\r\nelementary school at an early age, a grant of L2 was made payable on\r\naccount of ex-public elementary scholars between ten and twelve years of\r\nage. The full scale of grants is L2 for ex-public elementary scholars\r\nbetween ten and twelve, and L5 for scholars between twelve and eighteen.\r\nTo schools previously recognized and failing to comply with the new\r\nconditions, grant may be paid on the lower scale of L2 and L2, 10s.\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\nSecondary school grants are assessed upon average attendance, and\r\nefficiency is guaranteed by inspection and not by individual\r\nexamination. All recognized schools must provide at least the\r\nsubstantial equivalent of the four-years' course formerly required, and\r\nrecognition is withheld or withdrawn if an adequate number of the\r\nscholars do not remain at least four years in the school, or do not\r\nremain up to sixteen; in rural areas, however, and small towns, a school\r\nlife of three years and a leaving age of fifteen may be accepted. \"The\r\nboard are now in a position, through their inspectorate, to keep a watch\r\nand exercise a guidance which were previously impossible over the\r\nplanning and working of school curricula. Detailed reports following\r\nupon full inspections, and the more constant if less obvious influence\r\nexercised through informal visits, conferences, reports and suggestions,\r\nmay now be relied upon to guard against the risks of one-sided\r\neducation, of ill-balanced schemes of instruction, and of premature or\r\nexcessive specialization\" (Report of Board of Education, 1906-1907, page\r\n68). The curriculum must provide instruction duly graded and duly\r\ncontinuous, in the English language and literature, in geography and\r\nhistory, in mathematics, science and drawing, and in at least one\r\nlanguage other than English. Where two languages other than English are\r\ntaken, Latin must ordinarily be one. Provision must be made for\r\norganized games, physical exercises and manual instruction, and in\r\ngirls' schools science and mathematics other than arithmetic may be\r\nreplaced by an approved scheme of practical housewifery for girls over\r\nfifteen. The total number of secondary schools recognized for grant\r\n(_Statistics_, 1907-1908) was 736, of which only 220 were directly\r\nprovided by local authorities. The number of pupils in attendance was\r\n68,104 boys and 56,359 girls, total 124,463. The government grants for\r\n1907-1908 amounted to L320,873 besides grants from local authorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wales._\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the important differences which exist between the social\r\nand especially the religious conditions of England and Wales\r\nrespectively, Wales continued to be treated as one with England for\r\npurposes of educational administration down to quite recent years.\r\nTowards the end of the 19th century the striking revival of Welsh\r\nnationality, in itself largely an educational and a literary movement,\r\nled to a spontaneous demand among the Welsh people for the organization\r\nof a national system of higher education. In accordance with the\r\nrecommendations of a special royal commission the Welsh Intermediate\r\nEducation Act passed in 1889 provided for the creation in every county\r\nin Wales (including Monmouthshire) of joint education committees\r\nconsisting of three nominees of the county council and two nominees of\r\nthe lord president of the council. To these committees were entrusted\r\nthe duties of framing (under the Charity Commissioners) schemes for the\r\nestablishment of intermediate and technical schools and for the\r\napplication of endowments, and for administering a 1/2d. county rate,\r\nwhich was supplemented by a treasury grant not exceeding the amount\r\nraised by the rate. Certain supervisory functions were entrusted to a\r\nCentral Education Board, to which are committed the duties of inspection\r\nand examination. The joint education committees have now (except for the\r\npurpose of framing schemes for endowments) been superseded by the local\r\neducation authorities under the act of 1902. The public assistance\r\nafforded to secondary education in Wales under the Intermediate Act is\r\nsupplemented by the grants of the Board of Education, and the Board's\r\nrevised Secondary School Regulations were applied to Wales in 1908.\r\nThere were (1907-1908) 92 county secondary schools in Wales administered\r\nunder schemes made under the Welsh Intermediate Act, attended by 6235\r\nboys and 6727 girls, total 12,962; and 12 other secondary schools, of\r\nwhich 8 were provided by local authorities. The total attendance at all\r\nsecondary schools was 13,615, viz. 6819 boys and 6796 girls. The Board\r\nof Education grant amounted to L31,090. The expenditure of the local\r\nauthorities for the year 1906-1907 was L85,242.\r\n\r\nThe number of scholars on the registers of ordinary public elementary\r\nschools in Wales was (_Statistics_, 1907-1908), in council schools\r\n330,413, and in voluntary schools 100,290, total 430,703. The percentage\r\nof average attendance was 86.98. The ordinary parliamentary grant\r\n(1906-1907) was L794,161, and the net expenditure of local authorities\r\nL561,234.\r\n\r\nIn 1907 a Welsh department of the Board of Education was established\r\nwith a permanent secretary and a chief inspector, each responsible\r\ndirectly to the president. A movement was in progress in Wales in\r\n1908-1909 for the creation of a national council of education under an\r\nindependent minister, but this change could in any case only be effected\r\nby legislation; and meanwhile the special religious and social\r\nconditions in Wales caused administrative difficulties in working an act\r\n(that of 1902) primarily designed to meet those prevailing in England.\r\n     (G. B. M. C.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_United States._\r\n\r\n  Beginnings.\r\n\r\n_History._--The first white settlers who came to North America were\r\ntypical representatives of those European peoples who had made more\r\nprogress in civilization than any other in the world. Those settlers, in\r\nparticular those from England and from Holland, brought with them the\r\nmost advanced ideas of the time on the subject of education. The\r\nconditions of life in the New World emphasized the need of schools and\r\ncolleges, and among the earliest public acts of the settlers were\r\nprovisions to establish them. The steps taken between 1619 and 1622 to\r\nprovide schools for the colony of Virginia were frustrated by the Indian\r\nwar which broke out in the latter year, and were never successfully\r\nrenewed during the colonial period. In New York, where the influence of\r\nthe Dutch was at first predominant, elementary schools were maintained\r\nat the public expense, and were intended for the education of all\r\nclasses of the population. This policy reflected the very advanced views\r\nas to public elementary education which were then held in the\r\nNetherlands. The assumption of control in the colony of New York by the\r\nEnglish was a distinct check to the development of public elementary\r\neducation, and little or no further progress was made until after the\r\nRevolution. The most systematic educational policy was pursued in the\r\ncolony of Massachusetts. As early as 1635, five years after it was\r\nfounded, the town of Boston took action to the end that \"our brother\r\nPhilemon Pormort shall be entreated to become schoolmaster for the\r\nteaching and nurturing children with us.\" The General Court of the\r\ncolony in 1636 made the first appropriation for what was to become\r\nHarvard College, taking its name in honour of the minister, John\r\nHarvard, who died in 1638, leaving his library and one-half of his\r\nproperty, having a value of L800, to the new institution. The amount of\r\nthis appropriation of 1636 (L400) was remarkable in that it was probably\r\nequal to the whole colony tax for a year. In 1642 followed a legislative\r\nact which, while saying nothing of schools, gave to the selectmen in\r\nevery town power to oversee both the education and the employment of\r\nchildren. It is made the duty of the selectmen to see that the children\r\ncan read and understand the principles of religion and the capital laws\r\nof the country, and that they are put to some useful work.\r\n\r\nFive years later, in 1647, was enacted the law which is not only the\r\nreal foundation of the Massachusetts school system, but the type of\r\nlater legislation throughout the United States. This epoch-making act,\r\nthe first of its kind in the world, represented the public opinion of a\r\ncolony of about 20,000 persons, living in thirty towns. It required\r\nevery town of fifty house-holders to establish a school, the master of\r\nwhich should be paid either by the parents of the children taught or by\r\npublic tax, as the majority of the town committee might decide; and it\r\nfurther required every town of one hundred families or house-holders to\r\nset up a grammar school in which pupils might be prepared for the\r\n\"University,\" as the new institution at Cambridge was designated.\r\nMoreover, a penalty was attached to neglect of this legislative\r\nrequirement, in the form of a fine to be devoted to the maintenance of\r\nthe nearest school. Horace Mann said of the act of 1647: \"It is\r\nimpossible for us adequately to conceive the boldness of the measure,\r\nwhich aimed at universal education through the establishment of free\r\nschools. As a fact it had no precedent in the world's history; and, as a\r\ntheory, it could have been refuted and silenced by a more formidable\r\narray of argument and experience than was ever marshalled against any\r\nother institution of human origin. But time has ratified its soundness.\r\nTwo centuries of successful operation now proclaim it to be as wise as\r\nit was courageous, and as beneficent as it was disinterested.\" The\r\nsignificance of these acts of 1642 and 1647 is that they foreshadow the\r\nwhole American system of education, including elementary schools,\r\nsecondary schools and colleges, and that they indicate the principles\r\nupon which that system rests. These principles as summarized by George\r\nH. Martin in his _Evolution of the Massachusetts Public School System_\r\nare the following:--(1) The universal education of youth is essential to\r\nthe well-being of the state. (2) The obligation to furnish this\r\neducation rests primarily upon the parent. (3) The state has a right to\r\nenforce this obligation. (4) The state may fix a standard which shall\r\ndetermine the kind of education and the minimum amount. (5) Public money\r\nraised by general tax may be used to provide such education as the state\r\nrequires. The tax may be general, though the school attendance is not.\r\n(6) Education higher than the rudiments may be supplied by the state.\r\nOpportunity must be provided at the public expense for youths who wish\r\nto be fitted for college. These principles have now found expression in\r\nthe public acts of every state, and upon them education in the United\r\nStates is founded.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Development.\r\n\r\nDespite the praiseworthy attempts made in New York, New Jersey and\r\nPennsylvania to develop schools and school systems, very little was\r\naccomplished in those colonies which was permanent. The sentiment in the\r\nmore southern colonies was, as a rule, unfriendly to free schools, and\r\nnothing of importance was attempted in that section of the country until\r\nthe time of Thomas Jefferson. Through religious zeal or philanthropy\r\ncolleges were founded as far south as Virginia, and no fewer than ten of\r\nthese institutions were in operation in 1776. Their present names and\r\nthe dates of their foundation are: Harvard University, Massachusetts\r\n(1636); College of William and Mary, Virginia (1693); Yale University,\r\nConnecticut (1701); Princeton University, New Jersey (1746); Washington\r\nand Lee University, Virginia (1749); University of Pennsylvania,\r\nPennsylvania (1749); Columbia University, New York (1754); Brown\r\nUniversity, Rhode Island (1764); Rutgers College, New Jersey (1766); and\r\nDartmouth College, New Hampshire (1769). In the colleges the\r\necclesiastical spirit was at first almost uniformly dominant. The\r\ngreater number of their students were preparing for the ministry in some\r\none of the branches of the Protestant Church. These facts caused the\r\ngrammar schools to take on more and more the character of\r\ncollege-preparatory schools; and when this was brought about they\r\nsupplied the educational needs of but one portion of the community. As\r\ntime passed, the interdependence of governmental and ecclesiastical\r\ninterests began to weaken in the colonies, and there arose among those\r\nwho represented the new secularizing tendency a distrust of the colleges\r\nand their influence. This gave rise to a new and influential type of\r\nschool, the academy, which took its name from the secondary schools\r\nestablished in England by the dissenting religious bodies during the\r\nlatter part of the seventeenth century at the suggestion of Milton.\r\nThese academies were intended to give an education which was thought to\r\nbe more practical than that offered by the colleges, and they drew their\r\nstudents from the so-called middle classes of society. The older\r\nacademies were usually endowed institutions, organized under the control\r\nof religious organizations or of self-perpetuating boards of trustees.\r\nTheir programme of studies was less restricted than that of the grammar\r\nschools, and they gave new emphasis to the study of the English language\r\nand its literature, of mathematics and of the new sciences of nature.\r\nFor two generations the academies were a most beneficent factor in\r\nAmerican education, and they supplied a large number of the\r\nbetter-prepared teachers for work in other schools. These schools were\r\nin a sense public in that they were chartered, but they were not\r\ndirectly under public control in their management. Early in the 19th\r\ncentury there arose a well-defined demand for public secondary\r\nschools--high schools, as they are popularly known. They were the direct\r\noutgrowth of the elementary school system. Boston, Philadelphia,\r\nBaltimore and New York were the first of the large cities to establish\r\nschools of this type, and they spread rapidly. These public secondary\r\nschools met with opposition, however, springing partly from the friends\r\nof the academies, and partly from those who held that governmental\r\nagency should be restricted to the field of elementary education. The\r\nlegal questions raised were settled by a decision of the supreme court\r\nof Michigan, which contained these words: \"Neither in our state policy,\r\nin our constitution, nor in our laws do we find the primary school\r\ndistricts restricted in the branches of knowledge which their officers\r\nmay cause to be taught, or the grade of instruction that may be given,\r\nif their voters consent, in regular form, to bear the expense and raise\r\nthe taxes for the purpose.\" This decision gave marked impetus to the\r\ndevelopment of public secondary or high schools, and they have increased\r\nrapidly in number. The academies have relatively declined, and in the\r\nWestern states are almost unknown.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the elementary school system had grown rapidly. The school\r\ndistrict, the smallest civil division, was created in Connecticut in\r\n1701, in Rhode Island about 1750, and in Massachusetts in 1789. From the\r\npoint of view of efficient, well-supported schools, it has been felt\r\nsince the time of Horace Mann that the substitution of the small school\r\ndistrict for the town as the unit of school administration was a\r\nmistake. Yet the school district has exercised a profound influence for\r\ngood upon the American people. In New York state, for example, there\r\nwere in 1900 over eleven thousand school districts, and in Illinois over\r\ntwelve thousand. The districts are small in extent and often sparsely\r\nsettled. Their government is as democratic as possible. The resident\r\nlegal voters, often including women, hold a meeting at least once a\r\nyear. They elect trustees to represent them in the employment of the\r\nteacher and the management of the school. They determine whether a new\r\nschoolhouse shall be built, whether repairs shall be made, and what sum\r\nof money shall be raised for school purposes. In the rural districts\r\nthis system has often been itself a school in patriotism and in the\r\nconduct of public affairs. Recently the tendency is to merge the school\r\ndistricts into the township, in order that larger and better schools may\r\nbe maintained, and that educational advantages may be distributed more\r\nevenly among the people. Most of the southern states have the county\r\nsystem of school administration. This is because the county, rather than\r\nthe township, has been the political unit in the south from the\r\nbeginning. Special laws have been made for the school system in cities,\r\nand the form of these laws differs very much. In nearly every city there\r\nis a separate board of education, sometimes chosen by the voters,\r\nsometimes appointed by the mayor or other official, which board has\r\nfull control of the schools. The city board of education has as its\r\nexecutive officer a superintendent of schools, who has become a most\r\nimportant factor in American educational administration. He exerts great\r\ninfluence in the selection of teachers, in the choice of text-books, in\r\nthe arrangement of the programme of studies, and in the determination of\r\nquestions of policy. Sometimes he is charged by law with the initiative\r\nin some or all of these matters. He is usually a trained administrator\r\nas well as an experienced teacher. The first superintendent was\r\nappointed in 1837 at Buffalo. Providence followed in 1839, New Orleans\r\nin 1841, Cleveland in 1844, Baltimore in 1849, Cincinnati in 1850,\r\nBoston in 1851, New York, San Francisco and Jersey City in 1852, Newark\r\nand Brooklyn in 1853, Chicago and St Louis in 1854, and Philadelphia in\r\n1883. In general, it may be said that the progress of public education\r\nin the United States is marked by (1) compulsory schools, (2) compulsory\r\nlicensing of teachers, (3) compulsory school attendance, and (4)\r\ncompulsory school supervision, and by the increasingly efficient\r\nadministration of these provisions. The compulsion comes in each case\r\nfrom the state government, which alone, in the American system, has the\r\npower to prescribe it and to enforce it. Each state is therefore an\r\nindependent educational unit, and there is no single, uniform American\r\nsystem of education in any legal sense. In fact, however, the great mass\r\nof the American people are in entire agreement as to the principles\r\nwhich should control public education; and the points in which the\r\npolicies of the several states are in agreement are greater, both in\r\nnumber and in importance, than those in which they differ. An American\r\neducational system exists, therefore, in spirit and in substance, even\r\nthough not in form.\r\n\r\n\r\n  National policy.\r\n\r\nNeither in the Declaration of Independence nor in the Constitution of\r\nthe United States is there any mention of education. The founders of the\r\nnation were by no means indifferent to education, but they shared the\r\ncommon view of their time, which was that the real responsibility for\r\nthe maintenance of schools and the expense of maintaining them should\r\nfall upon the several local communities. The relation of government to\r\neducation was not then a subject of ordinary consideration or\r\ndiscussion. Later, when this question did arise and the power of\r\ntaxation was involved, the several states assumed control of education,\r\nas it was necessary that they should do. Nevertheless, from the very\r\nbeginning the national government has aided and supported education,\r\nwhile not controlling it. This policy dates from the 13th of July 1787,\r\nwhen there was passed the famous \"Ordinance for the Government of the\r\nTerritory of the United States North-West of the River Ohio,\" meaning\r\nthe territory north and west of the Ohio river now represented by the\r\nstates of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, and the eastern\r\nside of Minnesota, embracing more than 265,000 sq. m. of territory. This\r\nordinance contains this declaration: \"Religion, morality, and knowledge\r\nbeing necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools\r\nand the means of education shall for ever be encouraged.\" The Ordinance\r\nof 1787 also reaffirmed the provisions of the so-called Land Ordinance\r\nof 1785, by which section No. 16 in every township (a township consists\r\nof 36 numbered sections of 1 sq. m. each), or one thirty-sixth of the\r\nentire north-west territory, was set aside for the maintenance of public\r\nschools within the township. The funds derived from the sale and lease\r\nof these original \"school lands\" form the major portion of the public\r\nschool endowment of the states formed out of the north-west territory.\r\nThe precedent thus established became the policy of the nation. Each\r\nstate admitted prior to 1848 reserved section No. 16 in every township\r\nof public land for common schools. Each state admitted since 1848 (Utah\r\nbeing an exception, and having four sections) has reserved sections No.\r\n16 and No. 36 in every township of public lands for this purpose. In\r\naddition, the national government has granted two townships in every\r\nstate and territory containing public lands for seminaries or\r\nuniversities. A third land grant is that made in 1862 for colleges of\r\nagriculture and the mechanical arts. The sum total of these three land\r\ngrants amounted in 1900 to 78,659,439 acres, to which there must be\r\nadded various special grants made from time to time to the states and\r\ndevoted to education. The portion of the public domain so set apart in\r\n1900 amounted in all to 86,138,473 acres, or 134,591 English sq. m. This\r\nis an area greater than those of the six New England states, New York,\r\nNew Jersey, Maryland and Delaware added together. It is a portion of the\r\nearth's surface as great as the kingdom of Prussia, about seven-tenths\r\nas great as France, and considerably greater than the combined areas of\r\nGreat Britain (including the Channel Islands) and the kingdom of\r\nHolland. Besides the enormous grants of land in aid of education, the\r\nnational government has maintained since 1802 a military academy at West\r\nPoint, New York, for the training of officers for the army, and since\r\n1845 a naval academy at Annapolis, Maryland, for the training of\r\nofficers for the navy. It has also taken charge of the education of the\r\nchildren of uncivilized Indians, and of all children in Alaska. It has\r\nvoted, by act of 1887, a perpetual endowment of $15,000 a year for each\r\nagricultural experiment station connected with a state agricultural\r\ncollege, and, by act of 1890, an additional endowment of $25,000 a year\r\nfor each of the agricultural colleges themselves. The aggregate value of\r\nland and money given by the national government for education in the\r\nseveral states and territories is about $300,000,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Bureau of education.\r\n\r\nIn 1867 the Congress established a bureau of education, presided over by\r\na commissioner who is under the jurisdiction of the secretary of the\r\ninterior, the purpose of which is declared to be to collect \"such\r\nstatistics and facts as shall show the condition and progress of\r\neducation in the several states and territories, and of diffusing such\r\ninformation respecting the organization and management of school systems\r\nand methods of teaching as shall aid the people of the United States in\r\nthe establishment and maintenance of efficient school systems, and\r\notherwise promote the cause of education throughout the country.\" The\r\nbureau has therefore no direct power over the educational policy of the\r\nseveral states. It has, however, exercised a potent influence for good\r\nin its advisory capacity. Up to 1900 this bureau had published 360\r\nseparate volumes and pamphlets, including 31 annual reports, covering\r\nfrom 800 to 2300 pages each; and the number has since been much\r\nincreased. The annual reports alone of the Commissioner of Education are\r\nmines of information. These standard works of reference are distributed\r\ngratuitously in large numbers to libraries, school officials and other\r\npersons interested, and to foreign governments. The several\r\ncommissioners of education have been: Henry Barnard, 1867-1870; John\r\nEaton, 1870-1886; Nathaniel H.R. Dawson, 1886-1889; William T.\r\nHarris,[3] 1889-1906; Elmer Ellsworth Brown, 1906- .\r\n\r\n\r\n  State governments and education.\r\n\r\nIn the United States the sovereign powers are not all lodged in one\r\nplace. Such of those powers as are not granted by the Constitution to\r\nthe national government are reserved to the states respectively, or to\r\nthe people. The power to levy taxes for the support of public education\r\nhas been almost universally held to be one of the powers so reserved.\r\nThe inhabitants of the several local communities, however indisposed\r\nthey may have been to relinquish absolute control of their own schools,\r\nhave been compelled to yield to the authority of the state government\r\nwhenever it has been asserted, for except under such authority no civil\r\ndivision--county, city, township, or school district--possesses the\r\npower to levy taxes for school purposes. Moreover, since the exercise of\r\nstate authority has uniformly improved the quality of the schools, it\r\nhas usually been welcomed, not resisted. In general, it may be said that\r\nthe state has used its authority to prescribe a minimum of efficiency\r\nwhich schools and teachers must reach, and it enforces this minimum\r\nthrough inspection and the withholding of its proper share of the state\r\nschool fund from any locality where schools or teachers are permitted to\r\nfall below the required standard. In extreme cases the state authorities\r\nhave interfered directly to prevent the evil results of local\r\ninefficiency or contumacy. In addition, the states, almost without\r\nexception, maintain at their own expense schools for the training of\r\nteachers, known as normal schools. Many of the states also offer\r\ninducements to the cities, towns and districts to exceed the prescribed\r\nminimum of efficiency. Through the steady exercise of state supervision\r\nthe school buildings have improved, the standard for entrance upon the\r\nwork of teaching has been raised, the programme of studies has been made\r\nmore effective and more uniform, and the length of the school term has\r\nincreased. The Constitution of every state now contains some provision\r\nas to public education. Each state has an executive officer charged with\r\nthe enforcement of the state school laws. Sometimes, as in New York,\r\nthis official has plenary powers; sometimes, as in Massachusetts and\r\nOhio, he is little more than an adviser. In twenty-nine states this\r\nofficial is known as the superintendent of public instruction; in\r\nMassachusetts and Connecticut he is called secretary of the state board\r\nof education; other titles used are commissioner of public schools,\r\nsuperintendent of common schools, and superintendent of public schools.\r\nThe schools are administered, on behalf of the taxpayers, by an elected\r\nboard of school trustees in rural school districts, and by an elected\r\n(though sometimes appointed) board of education or school committee in\r\ncities and towns. In 836 cities and towns there is a local\r\nsuperintendent of schools, who directs and supervises the educational\r\nwork and acts as the executive officer of the board of education. The\r\nschools in the rural districts are under the direct supervision of a\r\ncounty superintendent of schools or similar official, who is often\r\nchosen by the people, but who sometimes is named by the state\r\nauthorities. The county and city superintendents are often charged with\r\nthe duty of holding examinations for entrance upon the work of teaching,\r\nand of issuing licences to those persons who pass the examinations. This\r\nsystem works best where it is carefully regulated by state law. Thirty\r\nstates, one territory, and the District of Columbia have enacted\r\ncompulsory education laws, but the enforcement of them is usually very\r\nlax. In fifteen states and territories there are no compulsory education\r\nlaws, although there are in existence there fully organized school\r\nsystems free to all children. The usual age during which school\r\nattendance is required is from 8 to 14. Provision is made in Maine, New\r\nHampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New\r\nJersey, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Minnesota and Michigan, for sending\r\nhabitual truants to some special institution. Laws forbidding the\r\nemployment of children under a specified minimum age in any mercantile\r\nor manufacturing establishment are in force in twelve states, and are\r\nusually administered in connexion with the compulsory education laws.\r\n\r\nThe universal establishment in America of public secondary schools (high\r\nschools), and the existence of state universities in all of the states\r\nsouth and west of Pennsylvania, have brought into existence a system of\r\nstate education which reaches from the kindergarten and the elementary\r\nschool to the graduate instruction offered at state colleges and\r\nuniversities. This system includes (1) about 1500 free public\r\nkindergartens scattered over fifteen states; (2) free public elementary\r\nschools within reach of almost every home in the land; (3) free public\r\nsecondary schools (high schools) in every considerable city or town and\r\nin not a few rural communities; (4) free land grant colleges, supported\r\nin large part by the proceeds of the nation's endowment of public lands,\r\npaying particular attention to agriculture and the mechanical arts, in\r\nall the states; (5) state universities, free or substantially so, in all\r\nthe states south and west of Pennsylvania; (6) free public normal\r\nschools, for the professional training of teachers, in nearly every\r\nstate; (7) free schools for the education of defectives in nearly all\r\nthe states; and (8) the national academies at West Point and Annapolis\r\nfor the professional training of military and naval officers\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Kindergartens.\r\n\r\nMiss Susan E. Blow, herself the leading exponent of kindergarten\r\nprinciples in the United States, has pointed out that the history of the\r\nkindergarten movement reveals four distinct stages in its development:\r\nthe pioneer stage, having Boston as its centre; the philanthropic stage,\r\nwhich began in the village of Florence, Mass., and reached its climax at\r\nSan Francisco, California; the national or strictly educational stage,\r\nwhich began at St Louis; and the so-called maternal stage, which from\r\nChicago as a centre is spreading over the entire country. During the\r\nfirst stage public attention was directed to a few of the most important\r\naspects of Froebel's teaching. During the second stage the kindergarten\r\nwas valued largely as a reformatory and redemptive influence. During the\r\nthird stage the fundamental principles underlying kindergarten training\r\nwere scientifically studied and expounded, and the kindergarten became\r\npart of the public school system of the country. The fourth stage,\r\nwhich, like the third, is fortunately still in existence, aims at making\r\nthe kindergarten a link between the school and the home, and so to use\r\nit to strengthen the foundations and elevate the ideals of family life.\r\nBy 1898 there were 4363 kindergartens in the United States (1365 of\r\nwhich were public), employing 9937 teachers (2532 in the public\r\nkindergartens) and enrolling 189,604 children (95,867 in the public\r\nkindergartens). Of the 164 public normal schools, 36 made provision for\r\ntraining kindergarten teachers. The scientific and literary activity of\r\nsome of the private kindergarten training classes is very great, and\r\nthey exert a beneficial and stimulating effect on teaching in the\r\nelementary schools. It is generally admitted that from the point of view\r\nof the children, of the teachers, of the schools, and of the community\r\nat large, the kindergarten has been and is an inspiration of\r\nincalculable value.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Elementary schools.\r\n\r\nThe elementary school course is from six to nine years in length, the\r\nordinary period being eight years. The pupils enter at about six years\r\nof age. In the cities the elementary schools are usually in session for\r\nfive hours daily, except Saturday and Sunday, beginning at 9 A.M. There\r\nis an intermission, usually of an hour, at midday, and short recesses\r\nduring the sessions. In the small rural schools the pupils are usually\r\nungraded, and are taught singly or in varying groups. In the cities and\r\ntowns there is a careful gradation of pupils, and promotions from grade\r\nto grade are made at intervals of a year or of a half-year. The best\r\nschools have the most elastic system of gradation and the most frequent\r\npromotions. In a number of states there are laws authorizing the\r\nconveyance of children to school at the public expense, when the\r\nschoolhouse is unduly distant from the homes of a portion of the school\r\npopulation. Co-education (q.v.) in the elementary school has been the\r\nsalutary and almost uniform practice in the United States. The programme\r\nof studies in the elementary school includes English (reading, writing,\r\nspelling, grammar, composition), arithmetic (sometimes elementary\r\nalgebra also, or plane geometry in the upper grades), geography, history\r\nof the United States, and elementary natural science, including human\r\nphysiology and hygiene. Physical training, vocal music, drawing and\r\nmanual training are often taught. Sometimes a foreign language (Latin,\r\nGerman or French) and the study of general history are begun. Formal\r\ninstruction in manners and morals is not often found, but the discipline\r\nof the school offers the best possible training in the habits of\r\ntruthfulness, honesty, obedience, regularity, punctuality and conformity\r\nto order. Religious teaching is not permitted, although the exercises of\r\nthe day are often opened with reading from the Bible, the repetition of\r\nthe Lord's Prayer and the singing of a hymn. Corporal punishment is not\r\ninfrequent, but is forbidden by law in New Jersey, and in many states\r\nmay be used only under restrictions. Text-books are used as the basis of\r\nthe instruction given, and the pupils \"recite\" in class to the teacher,\r\nwho, by use of illustration and comment, makes clear the subject-matter\r\nof the prescribed lesson. The purpose of the recitation method is to\r\nmake the work of each pupil help that of his companion. Skilfully used,\r\nit is the most effectual instrument yet devised for elementary school\r\ninstruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Secondary schools.\r\n\r\nThe secondary school course is normally four years in length. The\r\nprincipal subjects studied are Latin, Greek, French, German, algebra,\r\ngeometry, physics, chemistry, physical geography, physiology, rhetoric,\r\nEnglish literature, civics and history. Although but 11.36% of the\r\nstudents in public high schools and 25.36% of those in private secondary\r\nschools are preparing for a college or scientific school, yet the\r\nconditions prescribed by the colleges for admission to their courses\r\naffect powerfully both the secondary school programme and the methods of\r\nteaching. Of late years no educational topic has been more widely\r\ndiscussed than that as to the proper relations of secondary schools and\r\ncolleges. As a result, special examinations for admission to college are\r\neither greatly simplified or entirely abolished, and the secondary\r\nstudies are much more substantial and better taught than formerly. An\r\nincreasing proportion of secondary school teachers are college\r\ngraduates. The most extraordinary characteristic of secondary education\r\nin recent years is the rapid increase in the number of students taking\r\nLatin as a school subject. Meanwhile the proportion of those studying\r\nphysics and chemistry has fallen off slightly. The rate of increase in\r\nthe number of pupils who study Latin is fully twice as great as the rate\r\nof increase in the number of secondary school students. Between 1890 and\r\n1896, while the number of students in private secondary schools\r\nincreased 12%, the number of students in public secondary schools\r\nincreased 87%. Since 1894 the number of students in private secondary\r\nschools has steadily declined.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The colleges.\r\n\r\nThe American college, although it is the outgrowth of the English\r\ncolleges of Oxford and of Cambridge, has developed into an institution\r\nwhich has no counterpart in Europe. The college course of study, at\r\nfirst three years in length, was soon extended to four years, and the\r\nclasses are uniformly known as the freshman, the sophomore, the junior\r\nand the senior. The traditional degree which crowns the college course\r\nis that of Bachelor of Arts (A.B.). The studies ordinarily insisted on\r\nin the case of candidates for this degree are Latin, Greek, mathematics,\r\nEnglish, philosophy, political economy, history, at least one modern\r\nEuropean language (French or German), and at least one natural science.\r\nThe degrees of Bachelor of Science (B.S.), Bachelor of Philosophy\r\n(Ph.B.), and Bachelor of Letters (B.L.) are often conferred by colleges\r\nupon students who have pursued systematic courses of study which do not\r\ninclude Greek or the amount of Latin required for the degree of Bachelor\r\nof Arts. The best colleges give instruction which is similar in\r\ncharacter to that given in Germany in the three upper classes of the\r\ngymnasium and in the introductory courses at the universities, in France\r\nin the two upper classes of the lycee and in the first two years of\r\nuniversity study, and in England in the upper form of the public schools\r\nand during the years of undergraduate residence at Oxford and Cambridge.\r\nSince 1870 the colleges have developed enormously. Their resources have\r\nmultiplied, the number of their students has increased by leaps and\r\nbounds, the programme of studies has broadened and deepened, the\r\nstandards have been raised, and the efficiency of the instruction has\r\ngreatly increased. Rigidly prescribed courses of study have given way to\r\nelective courses, and a knowledge of Greek is no longer required for the\r\ndegree of A.B. at such influential colleges as Harvard, Columbia,\r\nCornell and Williams. A strong effort is being made to have the leading\r\ncolleges give but one degree, that of Bachelor of Arts, and to confer\r\nthat upon those who complete any substantial course of college studies.\r\nA marked change has taken place in the attitude of the college\r\nauthorities toward the students. In 1870 the college president was a\r\npaterfamilias. He knew each student and came into direct personal\r\ncontact with him. The president and the faculty had supervision not only\r\nof the studies of the students, but of their moral and religious life as\r\nwell. The older type of college professor was not always a great\r\nscholar, but he was a student of human nature, with keen intuitions and\r\nshrewd insight. The new type, which had come into existence at the\r\nopening of the 20th century, was more scholarly in some special\r\ndirection, often regarded teaching as a check upon opportunities for\r\ninvestigation, and disdained troubling himself with a student's personal\r\nconcerns or intellectual and moral difficulties. The change was not\r\naltogether for the better, and a desirable reaction has been\r\nobservable. Each college, however small or ill-equipped, exercises a\r\nhelpful local influence. Ninety per cent of all college students attend\r\nan institution not more than one hundred miles from their own homes. Few\r\ncolleges have a national constituency, and even in these cases an\r\noverwhelming preponderance of the students come from the immediate\r\nneighbourhood. This explains, in a measure, the powerful influence which\r\nthe college has exercised in the life of the nation. While hardly more\r\nthan one in a hundred of the white male youth of the country has had a\r\ncollege education, yet the college graduates have furnished one-half of\r\nall the presidents of the United States, most of the justices of the\r\nSupreme Court, about one-half of the cabinet officers and United States\r\nsenators, and nearly one-third of the House of Representatives. Before\r\nthe Revolution eleven colleges were founded. From 1776 to 1800, twelve\r\nmore were added; from 1800 to 1830, thirty-three; from 1830 to 1865, one\r\nhundred and eighty; from 1865 to 1898, two hundred and thirty-six. Their\r\nstandards, efficiency and equipment are very diverse, many of the\r\nso-called colleges being less effective than some of the better\r\norganized secondary schools. Except in New York and Pennsylvania, there\r\nis no statutory restriction upon the use of the name \"college.\" This is\r\nan abuse to which public attention has in recent years been increasingly\r\ncalled.[4]\r\n\r\n\r\n  The universities.\r\n\r\nIn the United States the title \"university\" is used indiscriminately of\r\ninstitutions which are in reality universities, of institutions which\r\nare colleges, and of institutions which are so ill-equipped as not to\r\ntake rank with good secondary schools. Only time and a greatly increased\r\ncapacity to distinguish the various types of higher schools will remedy\r\nthis error. Putting aside tentative and unsuccessful attempts to develop\r\ngenuine university instruction much earlier, it may safely be said that\r\nthe opening of the Johns Hopkins University at Baltimore in 1876 began\r\nthe present movement to organize carefully advanced study and research,\r\nrequiring a college education of those who wish to enter upon it. This\r\nis university instruction properly so called, and though found\r\nelsewhere, it is given chiefly at fourteen institutions: California\r\nUniversity, Catholic University of America, Chicago University, Clark\r\nUniversity, Columbia University, Cornell University, Harvard University,\r\nJohns Hopkins University, Michigan University, Pennsylvania University,\r\nPrinceton University, Leland Stanford Jr. University, Wisconsin\r\nUniversity and Yale University. All of these institutions, except the\r\nCatholic University of America, are also colleges. The combination of\r\ncollegiate and university instruction under one corporation and one\r\nexecutive administration is distinctive of higher education in the\r\nUnited States, and its chief source of strength. The crowning honour of\r\nthe university student is the degree of Ph.D., although that of\r\nA.M.--obtainable in less time and much easier conditions--is also\r\nsought. The minimum period of study accepted for the degree of Ph.D. is\r\ntwo years after obtaining the bachelor's degree; but in practice, three,\r\nand even four, years of study are found necessary. In addition to\r\ncarrying on an investigation in the field of his main subject of study,\r\nthe candidate for the degree of Ph.D. is usually required to pass\r\nexaminations on one or two subordinate subjects, to possess a reading\r\nknowledge of French and German (often of Latin as well), and to\r\nsubmit--usually in printed form--the dissertation which embodies the\r\nresults of his researches. The methods of instruction in the\r\nuniversities are the lecture, discussion and work in laboratory or\r\nseminary--the latter transplanted from the German universities. The\r\ndegree of Master of Arts is conferred upon students who, after one year\r\nof university residence and study, pass certain prescribed examinations.\r\nThis degree, like those of D.D., S.T.D. and LL.D., is often conferred by\r\ncolleges and universities as a purely honorary distinction. The degree\r\nof Ph.D. is not so conferred any longer by the best universities. Not a\r\nfew of the universities maintain schools of law and medicine. Harvard\r\nand Yale universities maintain schools of theology as well. The learned\r\npublications issued by the universities, or under the direction of\r\nuniversity professors, are of great importance, and constitute an\r\nimposing body of scientific literature. The national and state\r\ngovernments make increasing use of university officials for public\r\nservice requiring special training or expert knowledge. In 1871-1872\r\nthere were only 198 resident graduate (or university) students in the\r\nUnited States. In 1887 this number had risen to 1237, and in 1897 to\r\n4392. These figures are exclusive of professional students, and include\r\nonly those who are studying in what would be called, in Germany, the\r\nphilosophical faculty. (See also UNIVERSITIES.)\r\n\r\nMost extensive provision is made in America for professional, technical\r\nand special education of all kinds, and for the care and training of the\r\ndependent and defective classes (see BLINDNESS and DEAF AND DUMB), as\r\nwell as for the education of the Indian (see INDIANS, NORTH AMERICAN),\r\nand--in the Southern states--of the negro (q.v.). (N. M. B.)\r\n\r\n_Statistics._--Details as to education in each state of the American\r\nUnion are given in the articles under state headings. But a more\r\ncomprehensive view may be obtained here from the general statistics. The\r\nintroduction to the statistical tables in vol. ii. of the Commissioner\r\nof Education's Report for 1907 may usefully be quoted. Mr Edward L.\r\nThorndike, of the Teachers' College, Columbia University, there\r\nsummarizes the national account as follows:--\r\n\r\n  \"We use in formal school education a material plant valued at from\r\n  twelve to thirteen hundred million dollars, the labour of 550,000\r\n  teachers or other educational officers, and more or less of the time\r\n  of some eighteen million students.... We pay for the labour of these\r\n  teachers, many of whom work for only part of the normal city-school\r\n  year, about $300,000,000. We pay for fuel, light, janitorial services,\r\n  repairs, depreciation of books, school supplies, insurance and the\r\n  like, about $90,000,000. For depreciation of the plant not so charged\r\n  we should properly provide during the year a sinking fund of perhaps\r\n  $25,000,000. Adding an interest charge of 5% on the investment in the\r\n  plant, our annual bill for formal school education comes to over\r\n  $475,000,000. Additions to the plant were made [in 1906-1907] to the\r\n  extent of from ninety to a hundred million dollars. As a partial\r\n  estimate of the returns from this investment we may take the number of\r\n  students whose education has been carried to a specified standard of\r\n  accomplishment and power. Thus I estimate that, in 1907, 3000 students\r\n  reached the standard denoted by three years or more of academic,\r\n  technical or professional study in advance of a reputable college\r\n  degree; that 25,000 students reached the standard denoted by at least\r\n  three and not over four years of such study in advance of a four-year\r\n  high-school course; than an eighth of a million students reached the\r\n  standard denoted by at least three and not over four years of study in\r\n  advance of an eight-year elementary-school course; and that\r\n  three-quarters of a million students reached the standard of\r\n  completion of an elementary-school course of seven or eight years or\r\n  its equivalent.... Roughly, nine-tenths of elementary education and\r\n  the education of teachers, over two-thirds of secondary education, and\r\n  over a third of college and higher technical education are provided\r\n  and controlled by the public. Professional education, other than the\r\n  training of teachers and engineers, is still largely a function of\r\n  private provision and control.\r\n\r\n  \"The following rough comparison may serve to define further the status\r\n  of education in the country at large. The plant used for formal\r\n  education is valued at 1% of our entire national wealth, or twice the\r\n  value of our telephone systems, or ten times the value of our Pullman\r\n  and private cars, or one-tenth the value of our railroads. The number\r\n  of teachers is approximately that of the clergymen, engineers, lawyers\r\n  and physicians together, five times that of the regular army and navy,\r\n  and about twice that of the saloon-keepers and bar-tenders and their\r\n  assistants. The annual expenditure for education, exclusive of\r\n  additions to the plant, is somewhat over twice the expenditure for the\r\n  war and navy departments of the national government. It is three and a\r\n  half times the expenditure of the national government in 1907 for\r\n  pensions. It is about one and a fourth times the cost (New York\r\n  wholesale prices) of the sugar and coffee we consume annually.\"\r\n\r\nThe above comparison indicates perhaps, not inadequately, the \"business\"\r\nconception of the value of education prevailing in the United States,\r\nwhere its practical advantages are realized as in no other country, not\r\neven Germany.\r\n\r\nFrom the same report the following statistics may be cited for\r\n1906-1907.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Common Schools (including Elementary and Secondary Public\r\n  Schools only)._\r\n\r\n    Total number of pupils of all ages             16,820,386[5]\r\n    Average number of days schools open            151.2\r\n    Average number of days attended by each pupil  106.2\r\n    Number of male teachers                        105,773\r\n    Number of female teachers                      369,465\r\n    Number of school houses                        259,115\r\n    Average monthly wage of male teachers          $56.10\r\n    Average monthly wage of female teachers        $43.67\r\n    Value of all school property                   $843,309,410\r\n    Income from permanent funds and rents           $16,579,551\r\n    Income from State taxes                         $46,281,501\r\n    Income from local taxes                        $230,424,554\r\n    Income from other sources                       $50,317,132\r\n    Expenditure on sites, buildings, furniture,\r\n       libraries and apparatus                      $65,817,870\r\n    Expenditure on salaries                        $196,980,919\r\n    Expenditure on other purposes                   $67,882,012\r\n    Expenditure per head of population             $3.90\r\n    Expenditure per pupil                          $27.98\r\n\r\n  The Bureau of Education in 1907 received reports from 606\r\n  universities, colleges and technological schools; they had a teaching\r\n  force of 24,679, and an enrolment of 293,343 students. The number of\r\n  public and private normal schools reporting was 259, with an enrolment\r\n  of 70,439 students in the regular training courses for teachers,\r\n  12,541 graduates and 3660 instructors. There were 148 manual and\r\n  industrial training schools (independently of the manual training\r\n  taught in the public schools and in 66 Indian schools), with 1692\r\n  teachers and an enrolment of 68,427 students; and 445 independent\r\n  commercial and business schools, with 2856 instructors and 137,364\r\n  students.     (X.)\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--For the study of education as an aspect of religious,\r\n  social, moral and intellectual development, the material is\r\n  practically inexhaustible, and much of the most valuable does not\r\n  treat specifically of the education given in schools and colleges. The\r\n  most useful guide is E.P. Cubberley's _Syllabus of Lectures on the\r\n  History of Education_ (1902), which consists of an analytic outline of\r\n  topics with copious and detailed references to authorities. See also\r\n  W.S. Monroe's _Bibliography of Education_ (1897). The best general\r\n  history in English is P. Monroe's _Text-Book in the History of\r\n  Education_ (1905), which, like Davidson's much briefer _History of\r\n  Education_, treats the subject broadly and in relation to other\r\n  aspects of life. Williams's _History of Ancient, Medieval, and Modern\r\n  Education_ is a useful statement of the main facts of educational\r\n  progress taken somewhat by itself. In German the standard work is K.A.\r\n  Schmid's _Geschichte der Erziehung_, a comprehensive and detailed\r\n  treatment in which each period is dealt with by a specialist.\r\n  Ziegler's _Geschichte der Padagogik_ is a good short history. In\r\n  French, Letourneau's _L'Evolution de l'education_ is especially good\r\n  on ancient and non-European education. Draper's _Intellectual\r\n  Development of Europe_ is vigorous and interesting, but marred by its\r\n  depreciation of the work of the Church. Guizot's _History of\r\n  Civilization_ is still of value, as are parts of Hallam's _Literary\r\n  History_. Lecky's _History of the Rise and Influence of the Spirit of\r\n  Rationalism in Europe_, and Buckle's _History of Civilization_ in\r\n  England, contain much that is of value. The best encyclopaedias are W.\r\n  Rein's _Encyklopadisches Handbuch der Padagogik_, and F. Buisson's\r\n  _Dictionnaire de pedagogie, premiere partie_. Sir Henry Craik's _The\r\n  State and Education_ (1883) is an excellent text-book on national\r\n  education.\r\n\r\n  Of books dealing with special periods and topics, S. Laurie's\r\n  _Historical Sketch of Pre-Christian Education_, Freeman's _Schools of\r\n  Hellas_, Girard's _L'Education athenienne au V^e et au IV^e siecle\r\n  avant_ J.-C., Davidson's _Education of the Greek People_, Mahaffy's\r\n  _Old Greek Education_ and _Greek Life and Thought_, Nettleship's\r\n  article on \"Education in Plato's Republic\" in _Hellenica_, Capes's\r\n  _University Life in Athens_, Hobhouse's _Theory and Practice of\r\n  Ancient Education_, Grasberger's _Erziehung und Unterricht im\r\n  classischen Alterthum_, Wilkin's _Roman Education_, and Clarke's\r\n  _Education of Children at Rome_, are valuable for classical times.\r\n\r\n  For the somewhat obscure transition centuries there is much of value\r\n  in Taylor's _Classical Heritage of the Middle Ages_, Dill's _Roman\r\n  Society in the Last Century of the Western Empire_, especially the\r\n  chapter on \"Culture in the 4th and 5th centuries,\" Boissier's _La Fin\r\n  du paganisme_, and Hatch's _Influence of Greek Thought upon the\r\n  Christian Church_.\r\n\r\n  The best general account of medieval education is in Drane's\r\n  _Christian Schools and Scholars_; and J.B. Mullinger's _Schools of\r\n  Charles the Great_ treats well of the Carolingian Revival. G.B.\r\n  Adams's _Civilization during the Middle Ages_ is excellent; and\r\n  Sandys's _History of Classical Scholarship_ is a valuable book of\r\n  reference. On the scholastic philosophy Turner's _History of\r\n  Philosophy_, and Haureau's _Histoire de la philosophie scolastique_,\r\n  are useful. Medieval schools are described in Furnivall's preface to\r\n  _The Babees Book_, which deals with \"Education in Early England,\" and\r\n  in Leach's _Old Yorkshire Schools_ and _History of Winchester\r\n  College_. The most important books on the universities are Rashdall's\r\n  _Universities of Europe in the Middle Ages_, Jourdain's _Histoire de\r\n  l'universite de Paris aux XVII^e et XVIII^e siecles_, Lyte's _History\r\n  of the University of Oxford to 1530_, and Mullinger's _History of the\r\n  University of Cambridge to the Accession of Charles I._ Paulsen's\r\n  _Geschichte des gelehrten Unterrichts auf den deutschen Schulen und\r\n  Universitaten_ is the best history of education in Germany.\r\n\r\n  On the Renaissance in Italy, Villari's Introduction to his _Life and\r\n  Times of Machiavelli_, and Burckhardt's _Die Kultur der Renaissance in\r\n  Italien_ (translated into English), are of the first importance. Other\r\n  valuable books are the first volume of the _Cambridge Modern History_\r\n  and Symonds's great work on _The Renaissance in Italy_, especially the\r\n  volume on _The Revival of Learning_. Dealing more specifically with\r\n  education are Woodward's excellent monographs on _Education during the\r\n  Renaissance_, _Vittorino da Feltre_ and _Erasmus_. Janssen's\r\n  _Geschichte des deutschen Volkes_ (translated into English) gives a\r\n  good account of the social and intellectual condition of Germany in\r\n  the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries. Christie's _Life of Etienne Dolet_\r\n  is of value for the Renaissance in France. For the movement in England\r\n  Seebohm's _Oxford Reformers_, Gasquet's _Eve of the Reformation in\r\n  England_, Einstein's _The Italian Renaissance in England_, and Leach's\r\n  _English Schools at the Reformation, 1546-1548_, are particularly\r\n  important.\r\n\r\n  For later times the material is chiefly in the form of monographs, of\r\n  which the following, among others, are of value: Adamson's _Pioneers\r\n  of Modern Education_, Laas's _Die Padagogik des Johannes Sturm_,\r\n  Beard's _Port Royal_, vol. ii., Kuno Fischer's _Fr. Bacon und seine\r\n  Nachfolger_, Laurie's _John Amos Comenius_, Morley's _Rousseau_,\r\n  Pinloche's _La Reforme de l'education en Allemagne au dix-huitieme\r\n  siecle_, Biedermann's _Deutschlands geistige, sittliche, und gesellige\r\n  Zustande im XVIII. Jahrhundert_.\r\n\r\n  For the 19th century and after, the best sources of information are\r\n  the official Reports, such as those of the Royal Commissions on the\r\n  English Universities, the Public Schools, and the other English\r\n  secondary schools; the \"Special Reports,\" issued by the English Board\r\n  of Education; the encyclopaedic annual Reports of the American\r\n  Commissioner of Education (dealing not only with the United States,\r\n  but with progress in other countries); monographs in the French _Musee\r\n  pedagogique_, and various German Reports.\r\n\r\n  For education in the United States, see also Boone's _History of\r\n  Education in U.S.A._ (1889); N.M. Butler (editor), _Education in the\r\n  U.S.A._ (1900), a series of monographs prepared for the Paris\r\n  Exposition; E.G. Dexter's _History of Education in the United States_\r\n  (1904); and the _Proceedings_ of the National Educational Association.\r\n\r\n  On the leading writers on education the monographs in the Great\r\n  Educator Series are useful, and editions and translations of the best\r\n  known of these writers are available. The greatest systematic\r\n  collection is the _Monumenta Germaniae paedagogica_. On the\r\n  development of the means of education, Montmorency's two books on\r\n  _State Intervention in English Education from the Earliest Times to\r\n  1833_, and _The Progress of Education in England_, Balfour's\r\n  _Educational Systems of Great Britain and Ireland_, Allain's\r\n  _L'Instruction primaire en France avant la Revolution_, Lantoine's\r\n  _Histoire de l'enseignement secondaire en France au XVIII^e et au\r\n  debut du XVIII^e siecle_, and Konrad Fischer's _Geschichte des\r\n  deutschen Volkschullehrerstands_, may be mentioned.

During his father's\r\nlifetime he took an active part in the campaigns against the Danes,\r\nespecially in that of 894, and as early as 898 he signs a charter as\r\n\"rex,\" showing that he was definitely associated with his father in the\r\nkingship. He succeeded his father in October 899,[1] but not without\r\nopposition. The Aetheling Aethelwold, son of Alfred's elder brother\r\nAethelred, seized Wimborne and Christchurch. Edward advanced against him,\r\nand Aethelwold took refuge among the Danes in Northumbria. In 904\r\nAethelwold landed in Essex, and in the next year he enticed the East\r\nAnglian Danes to revolt. They ravaged all southern Mercia and, in spite\r\nof Edward's activity, returned home victorious, though Aethelwold fell in\r\nthe battle of the Holme. In 905 or 906 Edward made a peace with the East\r\nAnglian and Northumbrian Danes at \"Yttingaford,\" near Linslade in\r\nBuckinghamshire, perhaps the peace known as \"the Laws of Edward and\r\nGuthrum.\" In 909 and 910 fresh campaigns took place owing to southerly\r\nraids by the Danes, and victories were won at Tettenhall and Wednesfield\r\nin Staffordshire.[2] From 907 onwards Edward and his sister Aethelflaed,\r\nthe Lady of the Mercians, were busy strengthening their hold on Mercia\r\nand Wessex. Forts were built at Lincoln (907), \"Bremesbyrig\" (910),\r\n\"Scergeat\" and Bridgenorth (912), and when in the year 911 Aethelflaed's\r\nhusband Aethelred died, Edward took over from Mercia the government of\r\nLondon and Oxford, with the lands belonging to them, i.e. probably\r\nOxfordshire and Middlesex. The policy of constructing \"burhs\" or\r\nfortified towns was continued. Hertford was fortified in 911, Witham in\r\n912, while Aethelflaed fortified Cherbury in Shropshire, \"Weardbyrig\" and\r\nRuncorn (all in 915). In 913 the Danes in Eastern Mercia gave\r\nconsiderable trouble, and in 914 a fresh horde of pirates, coming from\r\nBrittany, sailed up the Severn. They raided southern Wales, but were\r\nhemmed in by the English forces and besieged until they promised to\r\nleave the king's territory. Edward watched the southern shores of the\r\nBristol Channel so carefully that the Danes failed to secure a hold\r\nthere, and were ultimately forced to sail to Ireland. In the same year\r\nEdward fortified Buckingham and received the submission of the jarls and\r\nchief men of Bedford. In 915 he fortified Bedford itself, Maldon in 916,\r\nand Towcester and \"Wigingamere\" in 917. In the last-mentioned year\r\nEdward captured and destroyed the Danish stronghold of Tempsford, and\r\nlater in the year he took Colchester. An attack by the Danes on Maldon\r\nfailed, and in 915 Edward went to Passenham and received the submission\r\nof the men of the \"borough\" of Northampton. The Danish strongholds of\r\nHuntingdon and Colchester were now restored and repaired, and Edward\r\nreceived the submission of the whole of the East Anglian Danes. Before\r\nmidsummer of this year Edward had fortified Stamford, and on the death\r\nof his sister he received the submission of the Mercians at Tamworth.\r\nThere also three kings of the North Welsh took Edward as their lord.\r\nNottingham was now fortified; Thelwall in Cheshire (919) and Manchester\r\nsoon followed; Nottingham was strengthened by a second fort; Bakewell\r\nwas fortified and garrisoned, and then came the greatest triumph of\r\nEdward's reign. He was \"chosen as father and lord\" by the Scottish king\r\nand nation, by Raegenald, the Norwegian king of Northumbria, by Ealdred\r\nof Bamborough, and by the English, Danes or Norwegians in Northumbria,\r\nand by the Strathclyde Welsh.\r\n\r\nWith the conclusion of his wars Edward's activity ceased, and we hear no\r\nmore of him until in 924 he died at Farndon in Cheshire and was buried\r\nin the \"New Minster\" at Winchester. He was thrice married: (1) to\r\nEcgwyn, a lady of rank, by whom he had a son Aethelstan, who succeeded\r\nhim, and a daughter Eadgyth, who married Sihtric of Northumbria in 924.\r\nThis marriage was probably an irregular one. (2) To Aelflaed, by whom he\r\nhad two sons--Aelfweard, who died a fortnight after his father, and\r\nEadwine, who was drowned in 933--and six daughters, Aethelflaed and\r\nAethelhild nuns, and four others (see AeTHELSTAN). (3) To Eadgifu, the\r\nmother of Kings Edmund and Edred, and of two daughters.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--_Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_ (ed. Plummer and Earle, Oxford);\r\n  Florence of Worcester (Mon. Hist.

Edward's brief reign was marked by an\r\nanti-monastic reaction. Aelfhere, earl of Mercia, once more expelled many\r\nof the monks whom Bishop Aethelwold had installed. There seems also to\r\nhave been some change in administrative policy, perhaps with regard to\r\nthe Danes, for Earl Oslac, whom Edgar had appointed to Northumbria, was\r\ndriven from his province. In ecclesiastical matters there were two\r\nparties in the kingdom, the monastic, which had its chief hold in Essex\r\nand East Anglia, and the anti-monastic, led by Aelfhere of Mercia.\r\nConferences were held at Kirtlington in Oxfordshire and at Calne in\r\nWiltshire in 977 and 978, but nothing definite seems to have been\r\ndecided. On the 18th of March 978 Edward's reign was suddenly cut short\r\nby his assassination at Corfe Castle in Dorsetshire. The crime was\r\nprobably inspired by his stepmother, Aelfthryth, who was anxious to\r\nsecure the succession of her son Aelthelred. The body was hastily\r\ninterred at Wareham and remained there till 980, when Archbishop Dunstan\r\nand Aelfhere of Mercia united in transferring it with great ceremony to\r\nShaftesbury. Edward seems to have been personally popular, and the poem\r\non his death in the chronicle calls his murder the worst deed in English\r\nhistory. Very shortly after his death he was popularly esteemed to be\r\nboth saint and martyr.\r\n\r\n  See _Saxon Chronicle_; _Vita S. Oswaldi_ (_Hist. of Ch. of York_,\r\n  Rolls Series); _Memorials of St Dunstan_ (ed. Stubbs, Rolls Series).\r\n       (A. Mw.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDWARD, \"THE CONFESSOR\" (d. 1066), so called on account of his\r\nreputation for sanctity, king of the English, was the son of Aethelred\r\nII. and Emma, daughter of Richard, duke of Normandy, and was born at\r\nIslip in Oxfordshire. On the recognition of Sweyn as king of England in\r\n1013, Aethelred, with his wife and family, took refuge in Normandy, and\r\nEdward continued to reside at the Norman court until he was recalled in\r\n1041 by Hardicanute. He appears to have been formally recognized as heir\r\nto the throne, if not actually associated in the kingship, and on the\r\ndeath of Hardicanute in 1042 \"all folk received him to be king,\" though\r\nhis actual coronation was delayed until Easter 1043. A few months later\r\nEdward, in conjunction with the three great earls of the kingdom, made a\r\nraid on the queen-mother Aelfgifu, or Emma, seized all her possessions\r\nand compelled her to live in retirement.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier years of the reign the influence of Earl Godwine was\r\npredominant, though not unopposed. His daughter Edith or Eadgyth became\r\nEdward's queen in 1045. But the king's personal tastes inclined much\r\nmore to foreigners than to Englishmen, and he fell more and more into\r\nthe hands of favourites from beyond the sea. Between Godwine,\r\nrepresenting the spirit of nationalism, and these favourites (especially\r\ntheir leader Robert of Jumieges, successively bishop of London and\r\narchbishop of Canterbury) there was war to the knife. In 1046 Magnus,\r\nking of Norway, who had succeeded Hardicanute in Denmark and claimed to\r\nsucceed him in England as well, threatened an invasion, but the\r\nnecessity of defending Denmark against his rival Sweyn Estrithson\r\nprevented him from carrying it into effect. In 1049, Godwine's son\r\nSweyn, who had been outlawed for the seduction of the abbess of\r\nLeominster, returned and demanded his restoration. This was refused and\r\nSweyn returned into exile, but not before he had with foulest treachery\r\nmurdered his young kinsman Beorn. He was, however, inlawed next year.\r\nThe influence of Godwine, already shaken, received a severe blow in 1051\r\nin the appointment of Robert of Jumieges to the archbishopric of\r\nCanterbury, and the same year saw the triumph of the foreigners for the\r\nmoment complete. Edward, indignant at the resistance offered by the men\r\nof Dover to the insolence of his brother-in-law Eustace of Boulogne and\r\nhis French followers, ordered Godwine to punish the town. Godwine\r\nrefused. The king at the prompting of the archbishop then summoned a\r\nmeeting of the witan, at which the old charge against Godwine of\r\ncomplicity in the murder of the Aetheling Alfred was to be revived. About\r\nthe same time came news of a fresh outrage by the foreigners. Godwine\r\ngathered his forces and demanded redress, while the earls Leofric of\r\nMercia and Siward of Northumbria hastened to the side of the king. Civil\r\nwar seemed imminent, but at length a compromise was effected by which\r\nthe matter was referred to a meeting of the witan to be held at London.\r\nAt the appointed time Godwine presented himself at Southwark. But his\r\nfollowers were rapidly deserting him, nor would the king give hostages\r\nfor his security. Alarmed for his safety, he fled to Flanders, while his\r\nson Harold went to Ireland. But their exile was brief. The tale of\r\nGodwine excited universal sympathy, for it was realized that he\r\nrepresented the cause of national independence. Encouraged by assurances\r\nfrom England, he sailed thither, and joining forces with Harold sailed\r\nalong the south coast and up the Thames. The king would have resisted\r\nbut found no support. Yielding to circumstances, he allowed himself to\r\nbe reconciled, and Godwine and his house were restored to their old\r\nposition. The queen at the same time was brought back from the monastery\r\nof Wherwell, whither she had been despatched after her father's flight.\r\nThe foreigners had already ignominiously fled the country, and\r\nhenceforth the influence of Godwine, and, after his death, of Harold,\r\nwas supreme. In 1063 Harold made a great expedition into Wales, in which\r\nhe crushed the power of King Gruffyd, who was killed by his own people.\r\nBut despite his prowess and his power, he was the minister of the king\r\nrather than his personal favourite. This latter position belonged to his\r\nyounger brother Tostig, who on the death of Siward in 1055 was appointed\r\nearl of Northumbria. Here his severity and arbitrary temper rendered him\r\nintensely unpopular, and in 1065 his subjects broke into revolt. They\r\nelected Morkere as their earl, then marching south demanded Tostig's\r\nbanishment. Edward desired to crush the revolt by force of arms, but he\r\nwas overborne and forced to submit. The election of Morkere was\r\nrecognized, and Tostig went into exile. Intensely mortified at this\r\nhumiliation, the king fell sick, and henceforth his health failed\r\nrapidly. He was unable to gratify his intense desire to be present at\r\nthe consecration of his new abbey of Westminster, the foundation of\r\nwhich had been the chief interest of his closing years, and on the 5th\r\nof January 1066 he died.\r\n\r\nThe virtues of Edward were monkish rather than kingly. In the qualities\r\nof a ruler he was conspicuously deficient; always dependent on others,\r\nhe ever inclined to the unworthier master. But the charm of his\r\ncharacter for the monastic biographer, and the natural tendency to\r\nglorify the days before the Norman oppression began, combined to cast\r\nabout his figure a halo which had not attached to it in life. Allowed to\r\nkeep her property by William the Conqueror, his widow, Edith, passed the\r\nremainder of her life at Winchester, dying on the 19th of December 1075.\r\n\r\n  SOURCES.--A number of lives of Edward are brought together in a volume\r\n  of the Rolls Series entitled _Lives of Edward the Confessor_, and\r\n  edited by Dr H.R. Luard (London, 1858). Of these by far the most\r\n  valuable is the contemporary _Vita Edwardi_, which would appear from\r\n  internal evidence to have been written by an unknown writer soon after\r\n  the Norman Conquest--some time between 1066 and 1074. The other chief\r\n  authorities for the reign are (1) the _Saxon Chronicle_, (C. Plummer,\r\n  Oxford, 1892-1899); (2) _Florence of Worcester_, ed. B. Thorpe,\r\n  English Historical Society (London, 1848-1849). Reference may also be\r\n  made to J.M. Kemble, _Codex diplomaticus aevi Saxonici_ (London,\r\n  1839-1848).     (C. S. P.*)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDWARD I. (1239-1307), king of England, born at Westminster on the 17th\r\nof June 1239, was the eldest son of Henry III. and Eleanor of Provence.\r\nHe was baptized Edward after Edward the Confessor, for whom Henry had\r\nspecial veneration, and among his godfathers was Simon de Montfort, earl\r\nof Leicester, his aunt Eleanor's husband. His political career begins\r\nwhen the conclusion of a treaty with Alphonso X. of Castile, by which he\r\nwas to marry the Spanish king's half sister Eleanor, necessitated the\r\nconferring on him of an adequate establishment. His father granted him\r\nthe duchy of Gascony, the earldom of Chester, the king's lands in Wales\r\nand much else. The provision made was so liberal that Henry's subjects\r\ndeclared he was left no better than a mutilated king. In May 1254 Edward\r\nwent to Gascony to take possession of his inheritance. He then crossed\r\nthe Pyrenees, and in October was dubbed knight by Alphonso and married\r\nto Eleanor at the Cistercian convent of Las Huelgas, near Burgos. He\r\nremained in Gascony till November 1255, but his father was too jealous\r\nto allow him a free hand in its administration. After his return, the\r\nattempts of his agents to establish English laws in his Welsh\r\npossessions brought Edward into hostile relations with the Welsh. Here\r\nalso his father would give him no help, and his first campaign brought\r\nhim little result. Edward became extremely unpopular through his\r\nassociation with his Lusignan kinsfolk, his pride and violence, and the\r\ndisorders of his household. In 1258 his strenuous opposition to the\r\nProvisions of Oxford further weakened his position, but, after the\r\nbanishment of the foreigners, he began to take up a wiser line. In 1259\r\nhe led the young nobles who insisted that the triumphant oligarchy\r\nshould carry out the reforms to which it was pledged. For a moment it\r\nlooked as if Edward and Leicester might make common cause, but Edward\r\nremained an enemy of Montfort, though he strove to infuse his father's\r\nparty with a more liberal and national spirit. He was the soul of the\r\nreconstituted royalist party formed about 1263. In 1264 he took a\r\nprominent part in the fighting between the king and the barons. At the\r\nbattle of Lewes his rash pursuit of the Londoners contributed to his\r\nfather's defeat. Two days later Edward surrendered to Leicester as a\r\nhostage for the good behaviour of his allies. He was forced to give up\r\nhis earldom of Chester to Leicester, but at Whitsuntide 1265 he escaped\r\nfrom his custodians, and joined the lords of the Welsh march who were\r\nstill in arms. With their aid he defeated and slew Leicester at Evesham\r\non the 4th of August 1265.\r\n\r\nFor the rest of Henry III.'s reign Edward controlled his father's policy\r\nand appropriated enough of Leicester's ideals to make the royalist\r\nrestoration no mere reaction. So peaceful became the outlook of affairs\r\nthat in 1268 Edward took the cross, hoping to join the new crusade of St\r\nLouis. Want of money delayed his departure till 1270, by which time St\r\nLouis was dead, and a truce concluded with the infidel. Refusing to be a\r\nparty to such treason to Christendom, Edward went with his personal\r\nfollowers to Acre, where he abode from May 1271 to August 1272. Despite\r\nhis energy and valour he could do little to prop up the decaying\r\ncrusading kingdom and he narrowly escaped assassination. At last the\r\ndeclining health of his father induced him to return to the West. He\r\nlearned in Sicily the death of Henry III. on the 16th of November 1272.\r\nOn the 20th of November, the day of Henry's funeral, he was recognized\r\nas king by the English barons, and from that day his regnal years were\r\nsubsequently computed. Affairs in England were so peaceful that Edward\r\ndid not hurry home. After a slow journey through Italy and France he did\r\nhomage to his cousin Philip III. at Paris, on the 26th of July 1273. He\r\nthen went to Gascony, where he stayed nearly a year. At last he landed\r\nat Dover on the 2nd of August 1274, and was crowned at Westminster on\r\nthe 18th of the same month.\r\n\r\nEdward was thirty-five years old when he became king, and the rude\r\nschooling of his youth had developed his character and suggested the\r\nmain lines of the policy which he was to carry out as monarch. He was a\r\ntall, well-proportioned and handsome man, extravagantly devoted to\r\nmilitary exercises, tournaments and the rougher and more dangerous forms\r\nof hunting. He had learned to restrain the hot temper of his youth, and\r\nwas proud of his love of justice and strict regard to his plighted word.\r\nHis domestic life was unstained, he was devoted to his friends, and\r\nloyal to his subordinates. Without any great originality either as\r\nsoldier or statesman, he was competent enough to appropriate the best\r\nideas of the time and make them his own. His defects were a hardness of\r\ndisposition which sometimes approached cruelty and a narrow and pedantic\r\ntemper, which caused him to regard the letter rather than the spirit of\r\nhis promises. His effectiveness and love of strong government stand in\r\nstrong contrast to his father's weakness. Though he loved power, and\r\nnever willingly surrendered it, he saw that to be successful he must\r\nmake his policy popular. Thus he continued the system which Montfort had\r\nformed with the object of restraining the monarchy, because he saw in a\r\nclose alliance with his people the best means of consolidating the power\r\nof the crown.\r\n\r\nThe first years of Edward's reign were mainly occupied by his efforts to\r\nestablish a really effective administration. In carrying out this task\r\nhe derived great help from his chancellor, Robert Burnell, bishop of\r\nBath and Wells. Administrative reform soon involved legislation, and\r\nfrom 1275 to 1290 nearly every year was marked by an important law. Few\r\nof these contained anything that was very new or original. They rather\r\nillustrate that policy which caused Dr Stubbs to describe his reign as a\r\n\"period of definition.\" Yet the results of his conservative legislation\r\nwere almost revolutionary. In particular he left the impress of his\r\npolicy on the land laws of England, notably by the clause _De Donis_ of\r\nthe Westminster statute of 1285, and the statute _Quia Emptores_ of\r\n1290. The general effect of his work was to eliminate feudalism from\r\npolitical life. At first he aimed at abolishing all franchises whose\r\nholders could not produce written warranty for them. This was the policy\r\nof the statute of Gloucester of 1278, but the baronial opposition was so\r\nresolute that Edward was forced to permit many immunities to remain.\r\nThough the most orthodox of churchmen, his dislike of authority not\r\nemanating from himself threatened to involve him in constant conflict\r\nwith the Church, and notably with John Peckham, the Franciscan friar,\r\nwho was archbishop of Canterbury from 1279 to 1292. The statute of\r\nMortmain of 1279, which forbade the further grant of lands to\r\necclesiastical corporations without the royal consent, and the writ\r\n_Circumspecte Agatis_ of 1285, which limited the church courts to\r\nstrictly ecclesiastical business, both provoked strong clerical\r\nopposition. However, Peckham gave way to some extent, and Edward\r\nprudently acquiesced in many clerical assumptions which he disliked. He\r\nwas strong enough to refuse to pay the tribute to Rome which John had\r\npromised, and his reign saw the end of that papal overlordship over\r\nEngland which had greatly complicated the situation under his father.\r\n\r\nBesides administration and legislation, the other great event of the\r\nfirst fifteen years of Edward's reign was the conquest of the\r\nprincipality of Wales. It was part of Edward's policy of reconciliation\r\nafter the battle of Evesham that in the treaty of Shrewsbury of 1267 he\r\nhad fully recognized the great position which Llewelyn ab Gruffyd,\r\nprince of Wales, had gained as the ally of Simon de Montfort. However,\r\nLlewelyn's early successes had blinded the Welsh prince to the\r\nlimitations of his power, and he profited by Edward's early absences\r\nfrom England to delay in performing his feudal obligations to the new\r\nking. Even after Edward's return Llewelyn continued to evade doing\r\nhomage. At last Edward lost patience, and in 1277 invaded north Wales.\r\nHe conducted his campaign like a great siege, blocking all the avenues\r\nto Snowdon, and forcing Llewelyn to surrender from lack of supplies. He\r\nthereupon reduced the Welsh prince to the position of a petty north\r\nWelsh chieftain strictly dependent on the English. For the next five\r\nyears Edward did his best to set up the English system of government in\r\nthe ceded districts. The Welsh resentment of this soon gave Llewelyn\r\nanother chance, and compelled Edward to devote the years 1282-1283 to\r\ncompleting his conquest. In 1284 he issued the statute of Wales, which\r\nprovided for a scheme for the future government of the principality.\r\nEdward is often called the conqueror of Wales, but in truth he only\r\neffected the conquest of Llewelyn's dominions. The march of Wales was\r\nonly indirectly affected by his legislation, and remained subject to its\r\nfeudal marcher lords until the 16th century.\r\n\r\nEdward was very careful in his foreign policy. Though preserving nominal\r\npeace with his cousin Philip III. of France, his relations with that\r\ncountry were constantly strained. After Philip III.'s death in 1285,\r\nEdward crossed the Channel in 1286, to perform homage to his successor,\r\nPhilip the Fair. He remained abroad till 1289, busied in attempts to\r\nimprove the administration of Gascony, and making repeated and finally\r\nsuccessful efforts to end by his mediation the still continuing struggle\r\nbetween the houses of Anjou and Aragon. His long absence threw the\r\ngovernment of England into confusion, and on his return in 1289 he was\r\ncompelled to dismiss most of his judges and ministers for corruption. In\r\n1290 he expelled all Jews from England.\r\n\r\nThe affairs of Scotland furnished Edward with his chief preoccupation\r\nfor the rest of his reign. After the death of Alexander III., in 1286,\r\nScotland was governed in the name of his granddaughter Margaret, the\r\nMaid of Norway. The English king had suggested that Edward of Carnarvon,\r\nhis eldest surviving son, should marry the little queen of Scots, and\r\nthus bring about the union of the two countries. Unluckily the death of\r\nMargaret in 1290 frustrated the scheme. The Scottish throne was now\r\ndisputed by many claimants, and the Scots asked Edward to arbitrate\r\nbetween them. Edward accepted the position, but insisted that, before he\r\nacted, the Scots should recognize him as their overlord. The claimants\r\nset the example of submission, and soon the chief Scots nobles followed.\r\nThereupon Edward undertook the arbitration, and in 1292 adjudged the\r\nthrone to John Baliol. The new king did homage to Edward, but his\r\nsubjects soon began to resent the claims of jurisdiction over Scotland,\r\nwhich Edward declared were the natural results of his feudal supremacy.\r\nAt last the Scots deprived John of nearly all his power, repudiated\r\nEdward's claims, and made an alliance with the French. During the years\r\nof the Scottish arbitration Edward had slowly been drifting into war\r\nwith France. The chronic difficulties caused by French attempts to\r\nconfine Edward's power in Gascony were now accentuated by the quarrels\r\nbetween the sailors and merchants of the two countries. In 1293 Edward\r\nwas persuaded by his brother, Edmund, earl of Lancaster, to yield up\r\nGascony temporarily to Philip the Fair. But Philip refused to restore\r\nthe duchy, and Edward, seeing that he had been tricked, declared war\r\nagainst France, at the very moment when the Scottish resistance gave the\r\nFrench a firm ally in Britain. To make matters worse, the Welsh rose in\r\nrebellion. It was therefore quite impossible for Edward to recover\r\nGascony.\r\n\r\nThe most critical years of Edward's reign now began. He saw that he\r\ncould only meet his difficulties by throwing himself on the support of\r\nhis own subjects, and convoked, in 1295, a representative parliament of\r\nthe three estates, which has been called in later times the Model\r\nParliament, because it first illustrated the type which was to be\r\nperpetuated in all subsequent parliaments. \"What touches all,\" ran\r\nEdward's writ of summons, \"should be approved of all, and it is also\r\nclear that common dangers should be met by measures agreed upon in\r\ncommon.\" The parliamentary constitution of England was established as\r\nthe result of Edward's action.\r\n\r\nSecure of his subjects' allegiance, Edward put down the Welsh revolt,\r\nand conquered Scotland in 1296. When quiet was restored to Britain, he\r\nhoped to throw all his energy into the recovery of Gascony, but new\r\ntroubles arose at home which once more diverted him from his supreme\r\npurpose. Led by Archbishop Winchelsea, Peckham's successor, the clergy\r\nrefused to pay taxes in obedience to the bull of Pope Boniface VIII.,\r\ncalled _Clericis Laicos_. Edward declared that if the clergy would not\r\ncontribute to support the state, the state could afford them no\r\nprotection. But the clerical opposition was soon joined by a baronial\r\nopposition. Headed by the earls of Hereford and Norfolk, many of the\r\nbarons declined to join in an expedition to Gascony, and Edward was\r\nforced to sail to the French war, leaving them behind. Thereupon the\r\nrecalcitrant barons forced upon the regency a fresh confirmation of the\r\ncharters, to which new articles were added, safeguarding the people from\r\narbitrary taxation. Edward at Ghent reluctantly accepted this\r\n_Confirmatio Cariarum_, but even his submission did not end the crisis.\r\nIn the same year (1297), all Scotland rose in revolt under the popular\r\nhero William Wallace, and next year (1298), Edward was forced to\r\nundertake its reconquest. The battle of Falkirk, won on the 22nd of\r\nJuly, was the greatest of Edward's military triumphs; but, though it\r\ndestroyed the power of Wallace, it did not put an end to Scottish\r\nresistance. Bitter experience taught Edward that he could not fight the\r\nFrench and the Scots at the same time, and in 1299 he made peace with\r\nPhilip, and, Eleanor having died in November 1290, he married the French\r\nking's sister Margaret (c. 1282-1318), and some years later obtained the\r\nrestitution of Gascony. In the same spirit he strove to destroy the\r\nclerical and baronial opposition. He did not succeed in the former task\r\nuntil a complacent pope arose in his own subject, Clement V., who\r\nabandoned Winchelsea to his anger, and suffered the archbishop to be\r\ndriven into exile. The baronial leaders could not be wholly overthrown\r\nby force, and Edward was compelled to make them fresh concessions.\r\n\r\nIt was not until 1303 that Edward was able to undertake seriously the\r\nconquest of Scotland. By 1305 the land was subdued, and Wallace beheaded\r\nas a traitor. But Edward had hardly organized the government of his new\r\nconquest when a fresh revolt broke out under Robert Bruce, grandson of\r\nthe chief rival of Baliol in 1290. Bruce was soon crowned king of Scots,\r\nand at the age of seventy Edward had to face the prospect of conquering\r\nScotland for the third time. He resolved to take the field in person;\r\nbut the effort was too great, and on the 7th of July 1307 he died at\r\nBurgh-on-Sands, near Carlisle. His death destroyed the last faint hope\r\nof conquering Scotland, and showed that the chief ambition of his life\r\nwas a failure. Yet his conquest of Wales, his legislation, his triumph\r\nover his barons, his ecclesiastics, and the greatest of French medieval\r\nkings indicate the strength and permanence of his work. He was buried\r\nat Westminster under a plain slab on which was inscribed _Edwardus\r\nprimus Scottorum malleus hic est. Pactum serva._\r\n\r\nBy Eleanor of Castile Edward had four sons, his successor Edward II. and\r\nthree who died young, and nine daughters, including Joan, or Joanna\r\n(1272-1307), the wife of Gilbert de Clare, earl of Gloucester (d. 1295),\r\nand then of Ralph de Monthermer; Margaret (1275-1318), the wife of John\r\nII., duke of Brabant; and Eleanor (1282-1316), who married John I.,\r\ncount of Holland, and then Humphrey Bohun, earl of Hereford (d. 1322).\r\nBy Margaret of France the king had two sons: Thomas of Brotherton, earl\r\nof Norfolk, and Edmund of Woodstock, earl of Kent.\r\n\r\n  The principal modern authorities for this reign are: W.

(T. F. T.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDWARD II. (1284-1327), \"of Carnarvon,\" king of England, the fourth son\r\nof Edward I. by his first wife Eleanor of Castile, was born at Carnarvon\r\nCastle on the 25th of April 1284. The story that the king presented the\r\nnew-born child to the Welsh as their future native prince is quite\r\nunfounded, for Edward was only made prince of Wales in the Lincoln\r\nparliament of 1301. When a few months old, he became by his elder\r\nbrother's death the heir to the throne, and Edward I. took great pains\r\nto train him in warfare and statecraft. He took part in several Scots\r\ncampaigns, but all his father's efforts could not prevent his acquiring\r\nthe habits of extravagance and frivolity which he retained all through\r\nhis life. The old king attributed his son's defects to the bad influence\r\nof his friend, the Gascon knight Piers Gaveston, and drove the favourite\r\ninto exile. When Edward I. died, on the 7th of July 1307, the first act\r\nof the prince, now Edward II., was to recall Gaveston. His next was to\r\nabandon the Scots campaign on which his father had set his heart.\r\n\r\nThe new king was physically almost as fine a man as Edward I. He was,\r\nhowever, destitute of any serious purpose, and was, as Dr Stubbs says,\r\n\"the first king after the Conquest who was not a man of business.\" He\r\ncared for nothing but amusing himself, and found his chief delight in\r\nathletics and in the practice of mechanical crafts. He was not so much\r\nvicious as foolish, and wanting in all serious interests. He had so\r\nlittle confidence in himself that he was always in the hands of some\r\nfavourite who possessed a stronger will than his own. In the early years\r\nof his reign Gaveston held this role, acting as regent when Edward went\r\nto France--where, on the 25th of January 1308, he married Isabella, the\r\ndaughter of Philip the Fair--and receiving the earldom of Cornwall with\r\nthe hand of the king's niece, Margaret of Gloucester. The barons soon\r\ngrew indignant at Edward's devotion to his \"brother Piers,\" and twice\r\ninsisted on his banishment. On each occasion Edward soon recalled his\r\nfriend, whereupon the barons, headed by the king's cousin Thomas, earl\r\nof Lancaster, went to war against king and favourite, and in 1312\r\ntreacherously put Gaveston to death. Edward was not strong enough even\r\nto avenge his loss. He was forced to stand aside and suffer the realm to\r\nbe governed by the baronial committee of twenty-one lords ordainers,\r\nwho, in 1311, had drawn up a series of ordinances, whose effect was to\r\nsubstitute ordainers for the king as the effective government of the\r\ncountry. But in all the ordinances nothing was said about the commons\r\nand lower clergy. Parliament meant to the new rulers an assembly of\r\nbarons just as it had done to the opponents of Henry III. in 1258. The\r\neffect of their triumph was to change England from a monarchy to a\r\nnarrow oligarchy.\r\n\r\nDuring the quarrels between Edward and the ordainers, Robert Bruce was\r\nsteadily conquering Scotland. His progress was so great that he had\r\noccupied all the fortresses save Stirling, which he closely besieged.\r\nThe danger of losing Stirling shamed Edward and the barons into an\r\nattempt to retrieve their lost ground. In June 1314 Edward led a great\r\narmy into Scotland in the hope of relieving Stirling. On the 24th of\r\nJune his ill-disciplined and badly led host was completely defeated by\r\nRobert Bruce at Bannockburn. Henceforth Bruce was sure of his position\r\nas king of Scots, and his pitiless devastation of the northern counties\r\nof England was his wild vengeance for the sufferings his land had\r\npreviously experienced from the English. Edward's disgraceful defeat\r\nmade him more dependent on his barons than ever. His kinsman, Thomas of\r\nLancaster, had now an opportunity of saving England from the\r\nconsequences of the king's incompetence. He had shown some capacity as a\r\nleader of opposition, but though he had great wealth, and was lord of\r\nfive earldoms, he had small ability and no constructive power. In his\r\ndesire to keep the king weak, he was suspected to have made a secret\r\nunderstanding with Robert Bruce. Before long the opposition split up\r\nunder his incompetent guidance into fiercely contending factions. Under\r\nAymer of Valence, earl of Pembroke, a middle party arose, which hated\r\nLancaster so much that it supported the king to put an end to\r\nLancaster's rule. After 1318 the effect of its influence was to restore\r\nEdward to some portion of his authority. However, the king hated\r\nPembroke almost as much as Lancaster. He now found a competent adviser\r\nin Hugh le Despenser, a baron of great experience. What was more\r\nimportant to him, he had in Despenser's son, Hugh le Despenser the\r\nyounger, a personal friend and favourite, who was able in some measure\r\nto replace Gaveston. The fierce hatred which the barons manifested to\r\nthe Despensers showed that they could hate a deserter as bitterly as\r\nthey had hated the Gascon adventurer. They were indignant at the favours\r\nwhich Edward lavished upon the favourite and his father, and were\r\nespecially alarmed when the younger Despenser strove to procure for\r\nhimself the earldom of Gloucester in right of his wife, Edward's niece.\r\n\r\nAt last, in 1321, the barons met in parliament, and under Lancaster's\r\nguidance procured the banishment of the Despensers. The disasters of his\r\nfriends inspired Edward to unwonted activity. In 1322 he recalled them\r\nfrom exile, and waged war against the barons on their behalf. Triumph\r\ncrowned his exertions. Lancaster, defeated at Boroughbridge, was\r\nexecuted at Pontefract. For the next five years the Despensers ruled\r\nEngland. Unlike the ordainers, they took pains to get the Commons on\r\ntheir side, and a parliament held at York in 1322 revoked the ordinances\r\nbecause they trenched upon the rights of the crown, and were drawn up by\r\nthe barons only. From this time no statute was technically valid unless\r\nthe Commons had agreed to it. This marks the most important step forward\r\nin Edward II.'s reign. But the rule of the Despensers soon fell away\r\nfrom this wise beginning. They thought only of heaping up wealth for\r\nthemselves, and soon stirred up universal indignation. In particular,\r\nthey excited the ill-will of the queen, Isabella of France. Craftily\r\ndissembling her indignation, Isabella kept silence until 1325, when she\r\nwent to France in company with her eldest son, Edward of Windsor, who\r\nwas sent to do homage for Aquitaine to her brother, the new French king.\r\nWhen her business was over, Isabella declined to return to her husband\r\nas long as the Despensers remained his favourites. She formed a criminal\r\nconnexion with Roger Mortimer of Wigmore, one of the baronial exiles,\r\nand in September 1326 landed in Essex accompanied by Mortimer and her\r\nson, declaring that she was come to avenge the murder of Lancaster, and\r\nto expel the Despensers. Edward's followers deserted him, and on the 2nd\r\nof October he fled from London to the west, where he took refuge in the\r\nyounger Despenser's estates in Glamorgan. His wife followed him, put to\r\ndeath both the Despensers, and, after a futile effort to escape by sea,\r\nEdward was captured on the 16th of November. He was imprisoned at\r\nKenilworth Castle, and a parliament met at Westminster in January 1327,\r\nwhich chose his son to be king as Edward III. It was thought prudent to\r\ncompel the captive king to resign the crown, and on the 20th of January\r\nEdward was forced to renounce his office before a committee of the\r\nestates. The government of Isabella and Mortimer was so weakly\r\nestablished that it dared not leave the deposed king alive. On the 3rd\r\nof April he was secretly removed from Kenilworth and entrusted to the\r\ncustody of two dependants of Mortimer. After various wanderings he was\r\nimprisoned at Berkeley Castle in Gloucestershire. Every indignity was\r\ninflicted upon him, and he was systematically ill-treated in the hope\r\nthat he would die of disease. When his strong constitution seemed likely\r\nto prevail over the ill-treatment of his enemies he was cruelly put to\r\ndeath on the 21st of September. It was announced that he had died a\r\nnatural death, and he was buried in St Peter's Abbey at Gloucester, now\r\nthe cathedral, where his son afterwards erected a magnificent tomb.\r\n\r\nEdward's wife, Isabella (c. 1292-1358), bore him two sons, Edward III.\r\nand John of Eltham, earl of Cornwall (1316-1336), and two daughters,\r\nIsabella and Joanna (1321-1362), wife of David II., king of Scotland.\r\nAfter the execution of her paramour, Roger Mortimer, in 1330, Isabella\r\nretired from public life; she died at Hertford on the 23rd of August\r\n1358.\r\n\r\n  See R.

T.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDWARD III. (1312-1377), \"of Windsor,\" king of England, eldest son of\r\nEdward II. and Isabella of France, was born at Windsor on the 13th of\r\nNovember 1312. In 1320 he was made earl of Chester, and in 1325 duke of\r\nAquitaine, but he never received the title of prince of Wales.\r\nImmediately after his appointment to Aquitaine, he was sent to France to\r\ndo homage to his uncle Charles IV., and remained abroad until he\r\naccompanied his mother and Mortimer in their expedition to England. To\r\nraise funds for this he was betrothed to Philippa, daughter of the count\r\nof Hainaut. On the 26th of October 1326, after the fall of Bristol, he\r\nwas proclaimed warden of the kingdom during his father's absence. On the\r\n13th of January 1327 parliament recognized him as king, and he was\r\ncrowned on the 29th of the same month.\r\n\r\nFor the next four years Isabella and Mortimer governed in his name,\r\nthough nominally his guardian was Henry, earl of Lancaster. In the\r\nsummer he took part in an abortive campaign against the Scots, and was\r\nmarried to Philippa at York on the 24th of January 1328. On the 15th of\r\nJune 1330 his eldest child, Edward, the Black Prince, was born. Soon\r\nafter, Edward made a successful effort to throw off his degrading\r\ndependence on his mother and her paramour. In October 1330 he entered\r\nNottingham Castle by night, through a subterranean passage, and took\r\nMortimer prisoner. On the 29th of November the execution of the\r\nfavourite at Tyburn completed the young king's emancipation. Edward\r\ndiscreetly drew a veil over his mother's relations with Mortimer, and\r\ntreated her with every respect. There is no truth in the stories that\r\nhenceforth he kept her in honourable confinement, but her political\r\ninfluence was at an end.\r\n\r\nEdward III.'s real reign now begins. Young, ardent and active, he strove\r\nwith all his might to win back for England something of the position\r\nwhich it had acquired under Edward I. He bitterly resented the\r\nconcession of independence to Scotland by the treaty of Northampton of\r\n1328, and the death of Robert Bruce in 1329 gave him a chance of\r\nretrieving his position. The new king of Scots, David, who was his\r\nbrother-in-law, was a mere boy, and the Scottish barons, exiled for\r\ntheir support of Robert Bruce, took advantage of the weakness of his\r\nrule to invade Scotland in 1332. At their head was Edward Baliol, whose\r\nvictory at Dupplin Moor established him for a brief time as king of\r\nScots. After four months Baliol was driven out by the Scots, whereupon\r\nEdward for the first time openly took up his cause. In 1333 the king won\r\nin person the battle of Halidon Hill over the Scots, but his victory did\r\nnot restore Baliol to power. The Scots despised him as a puppet of the\r\nEnglish king, and after a few years David was finally established in\r\nScotland. During these years England gradually drifted into hostility\r\nwith France. The chief cause of this was the impossible situation which\r\nresulted from Edward's position as duke of Gascony. Contributing causes\r\nwere Philip's support of the Scots and Edward's alliance with the\r\nFlemish cities, which were then on bad terms with their French overlord,\r\nand the revival of Edward's claim, first made in 1328, to the French\r\ncrown. War broke out in 1337, and in 1338 Edward visited Coblenz, where\r\nhe made an alliance with the emperor Louis the Bavarian. In 1339 and\r\n1340 Edward endeavoured to invade France from the north with the help of\r\nhis German and Flemish allies, but the only result of his campaigns was\r\nto reduce him to bankruptcy.\r\n\r\nIn 1340, however, he took personal part in the great naval battle off\r\nSluys, in which he absolutely destroyed the French navy. In the same\r\nyear he assumed the title of king of France. At first he did this to\r\ngratify the Flemings, whose scruples in fighting their overlord, the\r\nFrench king, disappeared when they persuaded themselves that Edward was\r\nthe rightful king of France. However, his pretensions to the French\r\ncrown gradually became more important. The persistence with which he and\r\nhis successors urged them made stable peace impossible for more than a\r\ncentury, and this made the struggle famous in history as the Hundred\r\nYears' War. Till the days of George III. every English king also called\r\nhimself king of France.\r\n\r\nDespite his victory at Sluys, Edward was so exhausted by his land\r\ncampaign that he was forced before the end of 1340 to make a truce and\r\nreturn to England. He unfairly blamed his chief minister, Archbishop\r\nStratford, for his financial distress, and immediately on his return\r\nvindictively attacked him. Before the truce expired a disputed\r\nsuccession to the duchy of Brittany gave Edward an excuse for renewing\r\nhostilities with France. In 1342 he went to Brittany and fought an\r\nindecisive campaign against the French. He was back in England in 1343.\r\nIn the following years he spent much time and money in rebuilding\r\nWindsor Castle, and instituting the order of the Garter, which he did in\r\norder to fulfil a vow that he had taken to restore the Round Table of\r\nArthur. His finances, therefore, remained embarrassed despite the\r\ncomparative pause in the war, although in 1339 he had repudiated his\r\ndebt to his Italian creditors, a default that brought about widespread\r\nmisery in Florence.\r\n\r\nA new phase of the French war begins when in July 1346 Edward landed in\r\nNormandy, accompanied by his eldest son, Edward, prince of Wales, a\r\nyouth of sixteen. In a memorable campaign Edward marched from La Hogue\r\nto Caen, and from Caen almost to the gates of Paris. It was a plundering\r\nexpedition on a large scale, and like most of Edward's campaigns showed\r\nsome want of strategic purpose. But Edward's decisive victory over the\r\nFrench at Crecy, in Ponthieu, on the 26th of August, where he scattered\r\nthe army with which Philip VI. attempted to stay his retreat from Paris\r\nto the northern frontier, signally demonstrated the tactical superiority\r\nof Edward's army over the French. Next year Edward effected the\r\nreduction of Calais. This was the most solid and lasting of his\r\nconquests, and its execution compelled him to greater efforts than the\r\nCrecy campaign. Other victories in Gascony and Brittany further\r\nemphasized his power. In 1346, David, king of Scots, was also defeated\r\nand taken prisoner at Neville's Cross, near Durham. In the midst of his\r\nsuccesses, however, want of money forced Edward to make a new truce in\r\n1347. He was as far from the conquest of France as ever.\r\n\r\nEdward returned to England in October 1347. He celebrated his triumph by\r\na series of splendid tournaments, and completed his scheme for the\r\nestablishment of the order of the Garter. In 1348 he rejected an offer\r\nof the imperial throne. In the same year the Black Death first appeared\r\nin England, and raged until 1349. Yet the horrors which it wrought\r\nhardly checked the magnificent revels of Edward's court, and neither the\r\nplague nor the truce stayed the course of the French war, though what\r\nfighting there was was indecisive and on a small scale. Edward's martial\r\nexploits during the next years were those of a gallant knight rather\r\nthan those of a responsible general. Conspicuous among them were his\r\nfamous combat with Eustace de Ribemont, near Calais, in 1349, and the\r\nhard-fought naval victory over the Spaniards off Winchelsea, in 1350.\r\nEfforts to make peace, initiated by Pope Innocent VI., came to nothing,\r\nthough the English commons were now weary of the war. The result of this\r\nfailure was the renewal of war on a large scale. In 1355 Edward led an\r\nunsuccessful raid out of Calais, and in January and February 1356\r\nharried the Lothians, in the expedition famous as the Burned Candlemas.\r\nHis exploits sank into insignificance as compared with those of his son,\r\nwhose victory at Poitiers, on the 19th of September 1356, resulted in\r\nthe captivity of King John, and forced the French to accept a new truce.\r\nEdward entertained his royal captive very magnificently, and in 1359\r\nconcluded with him the treaty of London, by which John surrendered so\r\nmuch that the French repudiated the treaty. Edward thereupon resolved to\r\ninvade France afresh and compel its acceptance. On the 28th of October\r\nhe landed at Calais, and advanced to Reims, where he hoped to be crowned\r\nking of France. The strenuous resistance of the citizens frustrated this\r\nscheme, and Edward marched into Burgundy, whence he made his way back\r\ntowards Paris. Failing in an attack on the capital, he was glad to\r\nconclude, on the 8th of May 1360, preliminaries of peace at Bretigny,\r\nnear Chartres. This treaty, less onerous to France than that of London,\r\ntook its final form in the treaty of Calais, ratified by King John on\r\nthe 9th of October. By it Edward renounced his claim to France in return\r\nfor the whole of Aquitaine.\r\n\r\nThe treaty of Calais did not bring rest or prosperity either to England\r\nor France. Fresh visitations of the Black Death, in 1362 and 1369,\r\nintensified the social and economic disturbances which had begun with\r\nthe first outbreak in 1348. Desperate, but not very successful, efforts\r\nwere made to enforce the statute of Labourers, of 1351, by which it was\r\nsought to maintain prices and wages as they had been before the\r\npestilence. Another feature of these years was the anti-papal, or rather\r\nanti-clerical, legislation embodied in the statutes of Provisors and\r\nPraemunire. These measures were first passed in 1351 and 1353, but often\r\nrepeated. In 1366 Edward formally repudiated the feudal supremacy over\r\nEngland, still claimed by the papacy by reason of John's submission.\r\nAnother feature of the time was the strenuous effort made by Edward to\r\nestablish his numerous family without too great expense. In the end the\r\nestates of the houses of Lancaster, Kent, Bohun, Burgh and Mortimer\r\nswelled the revenues of Edward's children and grandchildren, in whose\r\nfavour also the new title of duke was introduced.\r\n\r\nIn 1369 the French king, Charles V., repudiated the treaty of Calais and\r\nrenewed the war. Edward's French dominions gladly reverted to their old\r\nallegiance, and Edward showed little of his former vigour in meeting\r\nthis new trouble. He resumed the title and arms of king of France, but\r\nleft most of the fighting and administration of his foreign kingdoms to\r\nhis sons, Edward and John. While the latter were struggling with little\r\nsuccess against the rising tide of French national feeling, Edward's\r\nwant of money made him a willing participator in the attack on the\r\nwealth and privileges of the Church. In 1371 a clerical ministry was\r\ndriven from office, and replaced by laymen, who proved, however, less\r\neffective administrators than their predecessors. Meanwhile Aquitaine\r\nwas gradually lost; the defeat of Pembroke off La Rochelle deprived\r\nEngland of the command of the sea, and Sir Owen ap Thomas, a\r\ngrand-nephew of Llewelyn ab Gruffyd, planned, with French help, an\r\nabortive invasion of Wales. In 1371 the Black Prince came back to\r\nEngland with broken health, and in 1373 John of Lancaster marched to\r\nlittle purpose through France, from Calais to Bordeaux. In 1372 Edward\r\nmade his final effort to lead an army, but contrary winds prevented his\r\neven landing his troops in France. In 1375 he was glad to make a truce,\r\nwhich lasted until his death. By it the only important possessions\r\nremaining in English hands were Calais, Bordeaux, Bayonne and Brest.\r\n\r\nEdward was now sinking into his dotage. After the death of Queen\r\nPhilippa he fell entirely under the influence of a greedy mistress named\r\nAlice Perrers, while the Black Prince and John of Gaunt became the\r\nleaders of sharply divided parties in the court and council of the king.\r\nWith the help of Alice Perrers John of Gaunt obtained the chief\r\ninfluence with his father, but his administration was neither\r\nhonourable nor successful. His chief enemies were the higher\r\necclesiastics, headed by William of Wykeham, bishop of Winchester, who\r\nhad been excluded from power in 1371. John further irritated the clergy\r\nby making an alliance with John Wycliffe. The opposition to John was led\r\nby the Black Prince and Edmund Mortimer, earl of March, the husband of\r\nEdward's grand-daughter, Philippa of Clarence. At last popular\r\nindignation against the courtiers came to a head in the famous Good\r\nParliament of 1376. Alice Perrers was removed from court, and Duke\r\nJohn's subordinate instruments were impeached. But in the midst of the\r\nparliament the death of the Black Prince robbed the commons of their\r\nstrongest support. John of Gaunt regained power, and in 1377 a new\r\nparliament, carefully packed by the courtiers, reversed the acts of the\r\nGood Parliament. Not long after Edward III. died, on the 21st of June\r\n1377.\r\n\r\nEdward III. was not a great man like Edward I. He was, however, an\r\nadmirable tactician, a consummate knight, and he possessed extraordinary\r\nvigour and energy of temperament. His court, described at length in\r\nFroissart's famous chronicle, was the most brilliant in Europe, and he\r\nwas himself well fitted to be the head of the magnificent chivalry that\r\nobtained fame in the French wars. Though his main ambition was military\r\nglory, he was not a bad ruler of England. He was liberal, kindly,\r\ngood-tempered and easy of access, and his yielding to his subjects'\r\nwishes in order to obtain supplies for carrying on the French war\r\ncontributed to the consolidation of the constitution. His weak points\r\nwere his wanton breaches of good faith, his extravagance, his frivolity\r\nand his self-indulgence. Like that of Edward I. his ambition transcended\r\nhis resources, and before he died even his subjects were aware of his\r\nfailure.\r\n\r\nEdward had twelve children, seven sons and five daughters. Five of his\r\nsons played some part in the history of their time, these being Edward\r\nthe Black Prince, Lionel of Antwerp, duke of Clarence, John of Gaunt,\r\nduke of Lancaster, Edmund of Langley, afterwards duke of York, and\r\nThomas of Woodstock, afterwards duke of Gloucester. John and Edmund are\r\nalso important as the founders of the rival houses of Lancaster and\r\nYork. Each of the last four was named from the place of his birth, and\r\nfor the same reason the Black Prince is sometimes called Edward of\r\nWoodstock. The king's two other sons both died in infancy. Of his\r\ndaughters, three died unmarried; the others were Isabella, who married\r\ninto the family of Coucy, and Mary, who married into that of Montfort.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--The two chief modern lives of Edward III. are W.\r\n  Longman's _Life and Times of Edward III._, and J.

(1442-1483), king of England, son of Richard, duke of York,\r\nby Cicely Neville, was born at Rouen on the 28th of April 1442. As a boy\r\nhe was styled earl of March, and spent most of his time at Ludlow. After\r\nthe Yorkist failure at Ludlow field in October 1459, Edward fled with\r\nthe earls of Salisbury and Warwick, his uncle and cousin, to Calais.\r\nThence in the following July he accompanied them in their successful\r\ninvasion of England, to be welcomed in London, and to share in the\r\nvictory over the Lancastrians at Northampton. After the acceptance of\r\nRichard of York as heir to the crown, Edward returned to the Welsh\r\nmarches, where early in the new year he heard of his father's defeat\r\nand death at Wakefield. Hastily gathering an army he defeated the earls\r\nof Pembroke and Wiltshire at Mortimer's Cross on the 2nd of February\r\n1461, and then marched on London. He was acclaimed by the citizens in an\r\nassembly at Clerkenwell, declared king by a Yorkist council, and took\r\npossession of the regality on the 4th of March. Soon after the new king\r\nand the earl of Warwick went north, and on the 28th of March won a\r\ndecisive victory at Towton.\r\n\r\nEdward owed his throne to his kinsmen the Nevilles, and he was content\r\nfor the time to be guided by them. For himself he was young and fond of\r\npleasure. Still he made frequent progresses, and took some part in the\r\nfighting that went on in the north during 1462 and 1463. But he was\r\nabsent from the final victory at Hexham on the 14th of May 1464, and was\r\nat the very time engaged in contracting a secret marriage with\r\nElizabeth, daughter of Richard Woodville, Lord Rivers, and widow of Sir\r\nJohn Grey of Groby (d. 1461). The marriage was disclosed at Michaelmas,\r\nmuch to the vexation of Warwick, who in pursuit of his foreign policy\r\nhad projected a match with a French princess. Edward heaped favours on\r\nhis new relatives; his father-in-law was made treasurer, and great\r\nmarriages were found for his wife's sisters and brothers. In foreign\r\naffairs also Edward thwarted Warwick's plans by favouring an alliance\r\nwith Burgundy rather than France. There was, however, no open breach\r\ntill 1469, when Warwick, taking advantage of the unpopularity of the\r\nWoodvilles, and supported by the king's next brother George, duke of\r\nClarence, appeared in arms. Edward was surprised and made prisoner at\r\nMiddleham, and Rivers was beheaded. For six months Edward had to submit\r\nto Warwick's tutelage; then on the occasion of a rising in Lincolnshire\r\nhe gathered an army of his own. Sir Robert Welles, the leader of this\r\nrebellion, made a confession implicating Warwick, who fled with Clarence\r\nto France. The king thought himself secure, but when Warwick and\r\nClarence made terms with the Lancastrian exiles, Edward in his turn had\r\nto seek refuge in Holland (September 1470). His brother-in-law, Charles\r\nof Burgundy, at first refused him any assistance, but at last furnished\r\nhim with money, and on the 14th of March 1471 Edward and his brother\r\nRichard landed with a small force at Ravenspur near Hull. Marching south\r\nhe was welcomed at London on the 11th of April, defeated Warwick at\r\nBarnet three days later, and the Lancastrians at Tewkesbury on the 4th\r\nof May. From thenceforth Edward's possession of the crown was secure.\r\nHis position was strengthened by the birth of a son (2nd of November\r\n1470, during his exile), and by the wealth which he acquired through the\r\nconfiscation of the estates of his opponents. Clarence had made his\r\npeace with Edward, but was at enmity with his other brother Richard of\r\nGloucester, who now married Warwick's second daughter and claimed a\r\nshare in the Neville inheritance. Their rivalry and Clarence's continued\r\nintrigues furnished Edward with his chief domestic difficulty; the\r\ntrouble was ended by the judicial murder of Clarence in 1478.\r\n\r\nThe only serious enterprise of these latter years was the short French\r\nwar of 1475, from which Edward was bought out by the treaty of\r\nPecquigny. As foreign policy it was inglorious, and involved a departure\r\nfrom Edward's earlier plan of a Burgundian alliance. However, it shows a\r\ncertain recognition of England's need to concentrate her energies on her\r\nown development. The annual subsidy which Louis XI. agreed to pay\r\nfurther served Edward's purposes by providing him with money for home\r\ngovernment, and enabled him to avoid possible trouble through the\r\nnecessity for too frequent parliaments and heavy taxation. So Edward's\r\npersonal rule became in its character autocratic; but it was in the art\r\nof courting popularity and concealing despotism that he most shows\r\nhimself as a type of tyranny. He lacked neither ambition nor capacity,\r\nbut was indolent and only exerted himself spasmodically. He could be\r\nruthless, but was not habitually cruel. His strongest weapons were the\r\nfine presence, the affable manners (even with citizens), and the love of\r\npleasure and entertainments which secured his personal popularity. In\r\nhis last years he was given to self-indulgence and scandalous excesses,\r\nwhich did not, however, alienate the London citizens, with whose wives\r\nhe was too familiar. Most of the power at court was in the hands of the\r\nWoodvilles, in spite of their unpopularity; the more arduous work of\r\nadministration in the north was left to Richard of Gloucester. If as a\r\nprince of the Renaissance Edward was the first to rule tyrannically in\r\nEngland, he also deserves credit as a patron of the new culture and\r\nfriend of Caxton; he further resembles his Italian contemporaries in the\r\ncommercial purposes to which he applied his wealth in partnership with\r\nLondon merchants.\r\n\r\nEdward died at Westminster on the 9th of April 1483, and was buried at\r\nWindsor. By Elizabeth Woodville, who died on the 8th of June 1492, he\r\nhad two sons, Edward V. and Richard of York, who were murdered in the\r\nTower; and five daughters, of whom the eldest, Elizabeth, married Henry\r\nVII. Of his numerous mistresses the most notorious was Jane Shore.\r\nBefore his marriage he had been contracted to Lady Eleanor Butler, and\r\nthis was alleged by Richard III. to have made his children by Elizabeth\r\nWoodville illegitimate.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--Of original authorities for Edward's reign the chief\r\n  are the _Continuation of the Cropland Chronicle_ in Fulman's\r\n  _Scriptores_; the various London Chronicles, especially for the early\r\n  years _Gregory's Chronicle_; Warkworth's _Chronicle_, and the\r\n  _Arrivall of King Edward IV._ (a partisan account of events in\r\n  1470-1471), published by the Camden Society; the _Paston Letters_ with\r\n  Dr Gairdner's valuable Introduction; and for foreign affairs the\r\n  _Memoires_ of Philippe de Comines; the collection called _Chronicles\r\n  of the White Rose_ is useful.

K.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDWARD V. (1470-1483), king of England, was the elder son of Edward IV.\r\nby his wife Elizabeth Woodville, and was born, during his father's\r\ntemporary exile, in the sanctuary of Westminster Abbey on the 2nd of\r\nNovember 1470. In June 1471 he was created prince of Wales. When Edward\r\nIV. died in April 1483 a struggle for power took place between the young\r\nking's paternal uncle, Richard, duke of Gloucester, who had been\r\nappointed as his guardian by Edward IV., and his maternal uncle, Richard\r\nWoodville, Earl Rivers. Gloucester obtained possession of the king's\r\nperson, and, having arrested Rivers and some of his supporters, assumed\r\nthe crown himself after a very slight and feigned reluctance, on the\r\nground that the marriage of Edward and Elizabeth Woodville was invalid,\r\nand consequently its issue was illegitimate. At this time Edward and his\r\nbrother Richard, duke of York, were living in the Tower of London.\r\nShortly afterwards a movement was organized to free them from captivity,\r\nand then it became known that they were already dead; but, though it was\r\nthe general conviction that they had been murdered, it was twenty years\r\nbefore the manner of this deed was discovered. According to the\r\nnarrative of Sir Thomas More, Sir Robert Brackenbury, the constable of\r\nthe Tower, refused to obey Richard's command to put the young princes to\r\ndeath; but he complied with a warrant ordering him to give up his keys\r\nfor one night to Sir James Tyrell, who had arranged for the\r\nassassination. Two men, Miles Forest and John Dighton, then smothered\r\nthe youths under pillows while they were asleep. The murder was\r\ncommitted most probably in August or September 1483. Horace Walpole has\r\nattempted to cast doubts upon the murder of the princes, and Sir C.R.\r\nMarkham has argued that the deed was committed by order of Henry VII.\r\nBoth these views, however, have been traversed by James Gairdner, and\r\nthere seems little doubt that Sir Thomas More's story is substantially\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\n  See RICHARD III.; and in addition, Sir Thomas More, _History of\r\n  Richard III._, edited by J.R. Lumby (Cambridge, 1883); Horace Walpole,\r\n  _Historic Doubts on the Life and Reign of Richard III._ (London,\r\n  1768); J. Gairdner, _Richard III._ (Cambridge, 1898); J. Gairdner and\r\n  C.R. Markham in the _English Historical Review_, vol. vi. (London,\r\n  1891); Sir C.R. Markham, _Richard III._ (1907).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDWARD VI. (1537-1553), king of England and Ireland, born at Greenwich\r\non the 12th of October 1537, was the only child of Henry VIII. by his\r\nthird wife, Jane Seymour, who died of puerperal fever twelve days later.\r\nThe story that the mother's life was deliberately sacrificed by the\r\nperformance of Caesarean section is unfounded, although Jane's death\r\nwas little noticed amid the rejoicings which greeted the advent of a\r\nmale heir to the throne. But in spite of Holbein's vivacious portrait of\r\nEdward at the age of two (now at Hanover), he was a frail child, and a\r\nshort life was anticipated for him from his early years. This did not\r\nprevent a strenuous education; until the age of six he was naturally\r\nleft in the charge of women, but when he was only seven his tutor Dr\r\nCoxe, afterwards bishop of Ely, writes that he could decline any Latin\r\nnoun and conjugate any regular verb (_L. and P._, 1544, ii. 726); \"every\r\nday in the mass-time he readeth a portion of Solomon's Proverbs, wherein\r\nhe delighteth much.\" Sir John Cheke, Sir Anthony Cooke and Roger Ascham\r\nall helped to teach him Latin, Greek and French; and by the age of\r\nthirteen he had read Aristotle's _Ethics_ in the original and was\r\nhimself translating Cicero's _De philosophia_ into Greek.\r\n\r\nEdward was duke of Cornwall from his birth, but he was never prince of\r\nWales, and he was only nine when he succeeded his father as king of\r\nEngland and Ireland and supreme head of the church (28th of January\r\n1546/7). His nonage threw power into the hands of Somerset and then of\r\nNorthumberland, and enabled Gardiner and Bonner to maintain that the\r\nroyal supremacy over the church was, or should be, in abeyance. Projects\r\nfor his marriage were hardly even the occasion, but only the excuse, for\r\nSomerset's war on Scotland and Northumberland's subsequent alliance with\r\nFrance. All factions sought to control his person, not because of his\r\npersonality but because of his position; he was like the Great Seal,\r\nonly more so, an indispensable adjunct to the wielder of authority. The\r\nProtector's brother tried to bribe him with pocket-money; Northumberland\r\nwas more subtle and established a complete dominion over his mind, and\r\nthen put him forward at the age of fourteen as entitled to all the power\r\nof Henry VIII. But he was only Northumberland's mask; of his individual\r\ninfluence on the course of history during his reign there is hardly a\r\ntrace. A posthumous effort was made to give him the credit of a humane\r\ndesire to save Joan Bocher from the flames; but he recorded with\r\napparently cold-blooded indifference the execution of both his uncles,\r\nand he certainly made no attempt to mitigate the harassing attentions\r\nwhich the council paid his sister Mary. This passed for piety with the\r\nzealots, and the persecutions of Mary's reign reflected a halo on that\r\nof the Protestant Josiah. So strong was the regret that rumours of his\r\nsurvival persisted, and hare-brained youths were found to personate him\r\nthroughout Mary's and even far into Elizabeth's reign.\r\n\r\nIt was well that they were false, for Edward showed signs of all the\r\nTudor obstinacy, and he was a fanatic into the bargain, as no other\r\nTudor was except Mary. The combination would probably have involved\r\nEngland in disasters far greater than any that ensued upon his premature\r\ndeath; and it was much better that the Anglican settlement of religion\r\nshould have been left to the compromising temper of Elizabeth. As it\r\nwas, he bequeathed a legacy of woe; his health began to fail in 1552,\r\nand in May 1553 it was known that he was dying. But his will and the\r\nvarious drafts of it only betray the agitated and illogical efforts of\r\nNorthumberland to contrive some means whereby he might continue to\r\ncontrol the government and prevent the administration of justice. Mary\r\nand Elizabeth were to be excluded from the throne, as not sufficiently\r\npliant instruments; Mary Stuart was ignored as being under Scottish,\r\nCatholic and French influence; the duchess of Suffolk, Lady Jane's\r\nmother, was excluded because she was married, and the duke her husband\r\nmight claim the crown matrimonial. In fact, all females were excluded,\r\nexcept Jane, on the ground that no woman could reign; even she was\r\nexcluded in the first draft, and the crown was left to \"the Lady Jane's\r\nheirs male.\" But this draft was manipulated so as to read \"the Lady Jane\r\nand her heirs male.\" That Edward himself was responsible for these\r\ndelirious provisions is improbable. But he had been so impregnated with\r\nthe divine right of kings and the divine truth of Protestantism that he\r\nthought he was entitled and bound to override the succession as\r\nestablished by law and exclude a Catholic from the throne; and his last\r\nrecorded words were vehement injunctions to Cranmer to sign the will.\r\nHe died at Greenwich on the 6th of July 1553, and was buried in Henry\r\nVII.'s chapel by Cranmer with Protestant rites on the 8th of August,\r\nwhile Mary had Mass said for his soul in the Tower.\r\n\r\n  J.G. Nichols collected almost all that is known of Edward VI. in his\r\n  excellent edition of the king's _Journal_. A few additional facts and\r\n  suggestions can be gleaned from the _Letters and Papers of Henry\r\n  VIII._ vols. xii.-xxi.; _Acts of the Privy Council_, ed.

(ALBERT EDWARD) (1841-1910), king of Great Britain and\r\nIreland, and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas, emperor of India,\r\nthe eldest son and second child of Queen Victoria and of Albert, prince\r\nconsort, was born at Buckingham Palace on the 9th of November 1841. He\r\nwas created prince of Wales and earl of Chester on the 4th of December\r\nfollowing, and was baptized on the 25th of January 1842. In his\r\nchildhood he was educated by the dowager Lady Lyttelton; and in his\r\nboyhood successively by the Rev. Henry Mildred Birch, Mr F.W. Gibbes,\r\nthe Rev. C.F. Tarver and Mr Herbert W. Fisher. He afterwards resided at\r\nEdinburgh, studying chemistry in its industrial applications under\r\nProfessor (afterwards Lord) Playfair at the university; at Christ\r\nChurch, Oxford; and at Trinity College, Cambridge. In November 1858 he\r\nwas made a knight of the Garter and a colonel in the army. In 1859 he\r\ntravelled in Italy and Spain, and in 1860 paid a visit as \"Lord Renfrew\"\r\nto the United States and Canada.\r\n\r\nUpon the completion of his Cambridge course in June 1861 he joined the\r\ncamp at the Curragh. The prince consort died on the 13th of December,\r\nand in 1862 the prince of Wales went for a tour in the Holy Land\r\n(February-June) under the guidance of Arthur Penrhyn Stanley, afterwards\r\ndean of Westminster. Early in 1863 he was sworn of the privy council,\r\nand took his seat in the House of Lords as duke of Cornwall. The estate\r\nof Sandringham, in Norfolk, was purchased for him out of the savings of\r\nhis minority, and his town residence was fixed at Marlborough House.\r\n\r\nHis impending marriage to the princess Alexandra, daughter of Christian\r\nIX., king of Denmark (b. December 1, 1844), had already been announced,\r\nand took place on the 10th of March at Windsor, the beauty and grace of\r\nthe princess captivating the heart of the nation. Parliament granted the\r\nprince an income of L40,000 a year, exclusive of the revenues of the\r\nduchy of Cornwall, and he relinquished his right of succession to the\r\nduchy of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. Prince Albert Victor, afterwards duke of\r\nClarence, was the first offspring of the marriage, being born on the 8th\r\nof January 1864. The births followed of Prince George Frederick Ernest\r\nAlbert, afterwards duke of York (see GEORGE V.), on the 3rd of June\r\n1865; Princess Louise Victoria Alexandra Dagmar, by marriage duchess of\r\nFife, princess royal, on the 20th of February 1867; Princess Victoria\r\nAlexandra Olga Mary, on the 6th of July 1868; and Princess Maud\r\nCharlotte Mary Victoria, afterwards queen of Norway, on the 26th of\r\nNovember 1869.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of their marriage the prince and princess were prominently\r\nbefore the country. Queen Victoria remained in retirement, but they\r\nfilled her place at important public functions. The prince's readiness\r\nto promote every worthy cause was most marked; no one was a more\r\nconstant attendant at meetings for objects of public utility of a\r\nnon-political nature, and his speeches were always characterized by\r\nexcellent sense. The most important external event of these years was a\r\ntour to Egypt, undertaken in 1869 in company with the duke of\r\nSutherland, Sir Samuel Baker and others, an account of which was\r\npublished by Mrs William Grey. The prince also visited Ireland more than\r\nonce, and opened the International Exhibition of 1871.\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd of November 1871 it was announced that the prince would be\r\nprevented from paying a visit which had been arranged to the Maharajah\r\nDhuleep Singh by a feverish attack. It soon appeared that the malady was\r\ntyphoid, contracted as was supposed, on a visit to Scarborough. The\r\ncase became so serious that on November 29 the queen and Princess Alice\r\nhurried to Sandringham. On the 1st of December there was a slight rally,\r\nbut on the 8th so serious a relapse occurred that for some days the\r\nprince's life was despaired of. Under the skilful treatment of Sir\r\nWilliam Jenner, Sir William Gull and Sir James Paget, however, the\r\ncrisis was surmounted by December 16, and by Christmas day the danger\r\nwas regarded as virtually over. On the 27th of February 1872 a\r\nthanksgiving was held at St Paul's, amid imposing demonstrations of\r\npublic joy.\r\n\r\nIn January 1874 the prince of Wales attended the marriage at St.\r\nPetersburg of his brother, the duke of Edinburgh, with the grand-duchess\r\nMarie of Russia. In the same year he paid a historic visit to\r\nBirmingham, where Mr Joseph Chamberlain, not yet a member of parliament,\r\nreceived him officially as mayor. In March 1875 it was officially\r\nannounced that he would make a visit to India, carrying out an idea\r\noriginally conceived by the first Indian viceroy, Earl Canning. He was\r\nsupposed to travel as heir-apparent, not as representative of the queen;\r\nbut the characters could not be kept apart, and in fact the prince's\r\nvisit was a political event of great importance. Leaving England on\r\nOctober 11, he was received at Bombay by the viceroy, Lord Northbrook.\r\nHere he met a very large number of Indian feudatory princes, whose\r\nacquaintance he subsequently improved by visiting at their courts during\r\nthe seventeen weeks which he spent in the country. During these four\r\nmonths the prince travelled nearly 8000 m. by land and 2500 m. by sea,\r\nbecame acquainted with more rajahs than had all the viceroys who had\r\nreigned over India, and saw more of the country than any living\r\nEnglishman. The visit led up to the queen's assumption of the title of\r\nempress of India in the following year.\r\n\r\nThe prince's life after this date was full of conspicuous public\r\nappearances. In 1885 he visited Ireland at a time of much political\r\nexcitement, and was received enthusiastically in many quarters and\r\nwithout symptoms of ill-will in any. In 1886 he filled the presidency of\r\nthe Indian and Colonial Exhibition, opened the Mersey Tunnel, and laid\r\nthe first stone of the Tower Bridge. In 1887 a large share of the\r\narrangements for the queen's Jubilee devolved upon him. On the 27th of\r\nJuly 1589 his eldest daughter, Princess Louise, was married to the duke\r\nof Fife. In the autumn he paid a semi-incognito visit to Paris, where he\r\nwas always highly popular, viewed the Exhibition, and ascended the\r\nEiffel Tower. In 1890 he opened the Forth Bridge. On the 14th of January\r\n1892, however, a heavy blow fell upon him and his house by the death of\r\nhis eldest son, Prince Albert Victor, duke of Clarence, after a brief\r\nillness. The young prince, who with his brother George had made the tour\r\nof the world (1879-1882) in H.M.S. \"Bacchante,\" and after a short career\r\nat Oxford and Cambridge was just settling down to play his part in\r\npublic life, had recently become engaged to Princess Victoria Mary of\r\nTeck (b. May 26, 1867), and the popularity of the heir to the crown had\r\nbeen increased by the expression of his satisfaction at his son's bride\r\nbeing an English princess. On the 6th of July 1893 the broken thread was\r\nreunited by her marriage to Prince George, duke of York.\r\n\r\nThe year 1894 was a busy one for the prince of Wales, who became a\r\nmember of the royal commission on the housing of the poor, opened the\r\nTower Bridge, attended the Welsh Eisteddfod and was duly initiated, and\r\npaid two visits to Russia--one for the marriage of the grand-duchess\r\nXenia, the other for the funeral of the tsar, his brother-in-law. In\r\n1896 he became first chancellor of the university of Wales, and his\r\nfirst act after his installation at Aberystwyth was to confer an\r\nhonorary degree upon the princess. He had already been for some years a\r\ntrustee of the British Museum. On the 22nd of July 1896 his daughter.\r\nPrincess Maud, was married to Prince Charles of Denmark, who in 1905 was\r\noffered and accepted the crown of the new kingdom of Norway. The\r\narrangements for the queen's Jubilee of 1897 depended upon the prince\r\neven more than those of the corresponding celebration in 1887: he rode\r\non the queen's right at the great procession to St Paul's, and as an\r\nadmiral of the fleet presided at the naval review at Spithead. In July\r\n1898 the prince had the misfortune to fracture his knee-cap while on a\r\nvisit to Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild, but completely recovered from\r\nthe effects of the accident. In December 1899, while passing through\r\nBrussels on his way to St Petersburg, he was fired at by a miserable lad\r\nnamed Sipido, crazed by reading anarchist literature. Fortunately no\r\ninjury was done.\r\n\r\nIt was the especial distinction of Albert Edward, while prince of Wales,\r\nto have been a substantial support of the throne before he was called\r\nupon to fill it. This cannot be said of any of his predecessors except\r\nEdward the Black Prince. He was exemplary in the discharge of his public\r\nduties, and in his scrupulous detachment from party politics. He was a\r\nkeen patron of the theatre, and his thoroughly British taste for sport\r\nwas as pronounced as his inclination for most of the contemporary\r\namusements of society. The \"Tranby Croft Case\" (1890), in which Sir\r\nWilliam Gordon Cumming brought an unsuccessful libel action for having\r\nbeen accused of cheating at a game of baccarat, caused some comment in\r\nconnexion with the prince's appearance in the witness-box on behalf of\r\nthe defendants. But it did him no disservice with the people to have\r\ntwice won the Derby with his horses Persimmon (1896) and Diamond Jubilee\r\n(1900)--his third victory, in 1909, with Minoru, being the first\r\noccasion on which the race had been won by a reigning sovereign; and his\r\ninterest in yacht-racing was conspicuously shown at all the important\r\nfixtures, his yacht \"Britannia\" being one of the best of her day. His\r\nactivity in the life of the nation may be illustrated by his\r\nestablishment (1897) of the Prince of Wales's (afterwards King Edward's)\r\nHospital Fund, his devotion to the cause of Masonry (he was first\r\nelected grand master of the Freemasons of England in 1874), and his\r\nposition as a bencher of the Middle Temple, where he also became (1887)\r\ntreasurer.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Queen Victoria on the 22nd of January 1901, the question\r\nwhat title the new king would assume was speedily set at rest by the\r\npopular announcement that he would be called Edward the Seventh. The new\r\nreign began auspiciously by the holding of a privy council at St James's\r\nPalace, at which the king announced his intention to follow in his\r\npredecessor's footsteps and to govern as a constitutional sovereign, and\r\nreceived the oaths of allegiance. On the 14th of February the king and\r\nqueen opened parliament in state. Shortly afterwards it was announced\r\nthat the visit of the duke and duchess of York to Australia, in order to\r\ninaugurate the new Commonwealth, which had been sanctioned by Queen\r\nVictoria, would be proceeded with; and on the 16th of March they set out\r\non board the \"Ophir\" with a brilliant suite. The tour lasted till\r\nNovember 1, the duke and duchess having visited Australia, New Zealand,\r\nthe Cape and Canada; and on their return the king, on November 9,\r\ncreated the duke prince of Wales and earl of Chester. Meanwhile\r\nparliament had settled the new civil list at L470,000 a year, and the\r\nroyal title had been enlarged to include the colonial empire by an act\r\nenabling the king to style himself \"Edward VII., by the grace of God, of\r\nthe United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and of all the British\r\nDominions beyond the Seas, King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of\r\nIndia.\" At the end of May 1902 the long-drawn-out war in South Africa\r\ncame at last to an end, and the coronation was fixed for the 26th of\r\nJune. But on the 24th, amid general consternation, the king was\r\nannounced to be suffering from perityphlitis, necessitating the\r\nimmediate performance of an operation; and the coronation, for which\r\nunprecedented preparations had been made, had to be postponed. The\r\noperation--performed by Sir Frederick Treves--was, however, so\r\nmarvellously successful, and the king's progress towards recovery so\r\nrapid and uninterrupted, that within a fortnight he was pronounced out\r\nof danger, and soon afterwards it was decided to hold the coronation\r\nservice on August 9. Though shorn of much of the magnificence which\r\nwould have been added to it in June by the presence of foreign royalties\r\nand the preparations for a great procession through London, the\r\nsolemnity duly took place on that date in Westminster Abbey amid great\r\nrejoicings. The king spent several weeks (partly in a yachting trip\r\nround the coast and up to Stornoway) in recruiting his health, and on\r\nthe 25th of October he went in procession through the main streets of\r\nsouth London, when he was most enthusiastically received. Next day the\r\nking and queen attended St Paul's cathedral in state to return thanks\r\nfor his restoration to health. On New Year's day 1903 the coronation was\r\nproclaimed in India at a magnificent durbar at Delhi.\r\n\r\nAt home the king opened parliament in person in February 1903, and on\r\nthe 31st of March he sailed from Portsmouth to pay a visit to the king\r\nof Portugal at Lisbon, leaving Lisbon for Gibraltar on the 7th of April.\r\nOn the 11th he held a review of the garrison troops and next day left\r\nfor Malta, and the tour was continued to Naples (23rd of April). On the\r\n27th of April he was received at Rome by the king of Italy--the first\r\ntime an English king as such had been there; and two days later he paid\r\na visit to Leo XIII. at the Vatican. On May day he was received in Paris\r\nby President Loubet. Later in the year return visits were paid to\r\nEngland by President Loubet (July) and the king and queen of Italy\r\n(November). On the 11th of May His Majesty paid his first formal visit\r\nto Edinburgh, and held courts at Holyrood. In July the king and queen\r\nwent to Ireland, and though the Dublin corporation refused to vote a\r\nloyal address the reception was generally cordial. In September the king\r\ntook his annual \"cure\" at Marienbad, and paid a visit to Vienna, where\r\nhe was received by the Austrian emperor. In 1904 again the king and\r\nqueen went to Ireland; in June the king was cordially received by the\r\nGerman emperor at the yacht-races at Kiel, and he included a visit to\r\nHamburg, where the welcome was hearty. In November the king and queen of\r\nPortugal were entertained at Windsor and at the Guildhall.\r\n\r\nThe success of King Edward as a promoter of international friendliness,\r\nand the advantage of so efficient a type of kingship, attracted\r\nuniversal attention, and treaties of arbitration were concluded by Great\r\nBritain with France, Spain, Italy, Germany and Portugal in 1903 and\r\n1904. In his first two years the king had already earned the title of\r\nEdward the Peacemaker, and established his position as a source of new\r\nstrength to the state. This reputation was confirmed in the years which\r\nfollowed, during which the royal hand was to be seen in the progress of\r\nforeign affairs in a manner somewhat new to old-fashioned politicians.\r\nThe _entente_ with France was promoted by his influence, notably by his\r\nreception of President Fallieres in England in 1908. It was noticed that\r\nthe permanent under-secretary for foreign affairs, Sir Charles Hardinge,\r\ngenerally accompanied the king, as one of his suite, on his visits\r\nabroad: and the conclusion of the Anglo-Russian agreement (1907)--which\r\nwas attributed with some reason to royal policy--was hotly criticized in\r\nRadical quarters. It was pointed out that neither the foreign secretary\r\n(Sir E. Grey) nor any other secretary of state accompanied the king on\r\nhis foreign visits. These objections were, however, scouted by the\r\ngovernment, and undeniably public opinion approved of the sovereign's\r\npersonal activity in a sphere peculiarly his own. The strengthening of\r\nBritish influence in Europe, which was the marked result of the\r\nAnglo-French and Anglo-Russian _ententes_, and of the closer ties\r\nbetween England and countries like Portugal and Spain (whose young king\r\nAlfonso married Princess Ena of Battenberg, King Edward's niece), had,\r\nindeed, temporarily the effect of rousing German suspicion, the view\r\ntaken being that the object of British foreign policy was to isolate\r\nGermany; and during 1907 and 1908 the political situation was coloured\r\nby the discussions in the press with regard to Anglo-German rivalry. But\r\nin February 1909 the king and queen paid a state visit to the Kaiser in\r\nBerlin, where the greatest cordiality was displayed on all sides; the\r\nevent was prepared for, in both countries, as a means of dispelling the\r\nclouds which had gathered over the relations between England and\r\nGermany, and the success of the visit proved once more how powerful King\r\nEdward's personality could be as an agency for peace and international\r\namity.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1909, however, the political situation at home was\r\ndeveloping into an acute constitutional crisis, which seemed likely to\r\ninvolve the Crown in serious difficulties. Mr Lloyd-George's budget\r\nconvulsed the House of Commons and the country, and was eventually\r\nrejected by the House of Lords; and the Liberal government now put in\r\nthe forefront of its programme the abolition of the Peers' \"veto.\" As\r\nwas hinted, not obscurely, later by the doctors, King Edward, although\r\ncertainly not prejudiced against a Liberal ministry, was seriously\r\ndisturbed in mind and health by the progress of events, which culminated\r\nin the return of Mr Asquith to office after the elections of January\r\n1910, and in his statement that, if necessary, guarantees would be\r\nsought from the Crown for the purpose of enforcing the will of the\r\nrepresentative chamber. A remarkable sign of the king's discomfort was\r\nhis insertion, in the official \"King's Speech\" at the opening of\r\nparliament, of the words \"in the opinion of my advisers,\" in connexion\r\nwith the passage dealing with the House of Lords. The king had been far\r\nfrom robust for some little time, and while he was taking change and\r\nrest at Biarritz in the early spring of 1910 he had a bronchial attack\r\nwhich caused some anxiety, although the public heard nothing of it. When\r\nhe returned to England there is no doubt that he was acutely affected by\r\nthe prospect of being forcibly dragged into the political conflict. In\r\nthe country at large there was indeed considerable confidence that the\r\nking's tact and experience would help to bring order out of chaos; but\r\nthis was not to be. Within two days the public heard with consternation\r\nthat he was ill, and then was dead. On May 5 it was announced that he\r\nhad bronchitis; and he died at 11.45 P.M. on the 6th, of heart failure.\r\nOn May 17, 18 and 19 there was an impressive lying-in-state in\r\nWestminster Hall, attended by unprecedented crowds; and on May 20 the\r\nburial took place at Windsor, after a great funeral procession through\r\nLondon, the coffin being followed by the new king, George V., and by\r\neight foreign sovereigns--the German emperor, the kings of Greece,\r\nSpain, Portugal, Denmark, Norway, Belgium and Bulgaria--besides the\r\narchduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria (heir to the throne of\r\nAustria-Hungary), the prince consort of Holland and many other\r\nroyalties, and a number of special ambassadors, including Mr Roosevelt\r\nas representative of the United States. Mourning was as sincere as it\r\nwas universal; for not only England and the British Empire, but the\r\nworld, had lost a king who was both a very human man and a tried and\r\ntrusted statesman.\r\n\r\nQueen Victoria's long reign had solidly established the constitutional\r\nmonarchy; it remained for her son to rehabilitate the idea of English\r\nkingship by showing how the sovereign could be no less constitutional\r\nbut personally more monarchical. While prince of Wales he had had little\r\nreal training in statecraft, but when he became king his genuine\r\ncapacity for affairs was shown. Ably advised by such men as Lord Knollys\r\nand Lord Esher, he devoted himself to the work of removing the Throne\r\nfrom its former isolation, and bringing it into touch with all sections\r\nof the community for the promotion of social happiness and welfare. His\r\nown love of pageantry and his interest in the stately ordering of court\r\nfunctions responded, moreover, to a marked inclination on the part of\r\nthe public and of \"society\" for such things. It was significant that\r\neven Radicals and Socialists began to advocate extensions of the\r\nprerogative, and to insist on the active part which the Crown should\r\nplay in public life. The king won the genuine affection and confidence\r\nof the people; and in Queen Alexandra he had an ideal consort, to whom\r\nall hearts went out.     (H. Ch.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDWARD, prince of Wales, known as \"THE BLACK PRINCE\" (1330-1376), the\r\neldest son of Edward III. and Philippa of Hainaut, was born at Woodstock\r\non the 15th of June 1330. Contemporaries called him Edward of Woodstock,\r\nand his surname of the Black Prince cannot be traced back earlier than\r\nthe 16th century. It is supposed to have been derived from his wearing\r\nblack armour. In 1333 he was made earl of Chester, and in 1337 duke of\r\nCornwall, being the first duke ever created in England. Nominal warden\r\nof England during his father's absences abroad in 1338 and 1342, he was\r\ncreated prince of Wales in 1343, and in 1345 he first accompanied his\r\nfather on a foreign expedition.\r\n\r\nHis real career begins, however, with Edward III.'s Norman campaign of\r\n1346. On landing at La Hogue he was knighted by his father, and took a\r\nprominent part in the whole of the campaign. He commanded the right wing\r\nof the English forces at Crecy, and, though hard pressed for a time by\r\nthe French, took his full share in gaining the victory. Next year he was\r\nat the siege of Calais, and returned to England in October 1347 with his\r\nfather. He was one of the original knights of the Garter, and\r\nparticipated in his father's chivalrous adventures at Calais in 1349 and\r\nin the battle off Winchelsea in 1350. In September 1355 he was sent to\r\nGascony at the head of an English army, having been appointed his\r\nfather's lieutenant there in July. He was warmly welcomed by the\r\nGascons, and at once led a foray through Armagnac and Languedoc. By\r\nNovember he had got as far as Narbonne, whence he returned to Bordeaux,\r\nwhere he kept his Christmas court. In August 1356 he started from\r\nBergerac on another marauding expedition, this time in a northerly\r\ndirection. He penetrated as far as the Loire, but was there compelled to\r\nretire before the superior forces of King John of France. On the 19th of\r\nSeptember the two armies met in the battle of Poitiers, fought about 6\r\nm. south-east of the city. It was the hardest-fought and most important\r\nbattle of the Hundred Years' War, and Edward's victory was due both to\r\nthe excellence of his tactical disposition of his forces and to the\r\nsuperior fighting capacity of his army. The flank march of the Captal de\r\nBuch, which decided the fate of the day, was of Edward's own devising,\r\nand the captivity of King John attested the completeness of his triumph.\r\nHe treated his prisoner with almost ostentatious magnanimity, and took\r\nhim to Bordeaux, whence they sailed to England in May 1357. On the 24th\r\nof that month he led his prisoner in triumph through the streets of\r\nLondon. In 1359 he took part in his father's invasion of northern\r\nFrance, and had a large share in the negotiations at Bretigny and\r\nCalais.\r\n\r\nIn October 1361 Edward married his cousin Joan, countess of Kent\r\n(1328-1385), the daughter and heiress of Edmund of Woodstock, earl of\r\nKent, the younger son of Edward I. by his second wife Margaret of\r\nFrance. The lady, who enjoyed a great reputation for beauty, was in her\r\nthirty-third year, and the widow of Sir Thomas Holand, by whom she had\r\nhad three children. Froissart says that the marriage was a love match,\r\nand that the king had no knowledge of it. However, Edward III. approved\r\nof his son's choice, and in July 1362 handed over to him all his\r\ndominions in southern France, with the title of prince of Aquitaine. In\r\nFebruary 1363 Edward and Joan took ship for Gascony, which became his\r\nordinary place of residence for the next eight years. He maintained a\r\nbrilliant court at Bordeaux and Angouleme, and did his best to win the\r\nsupport of the Gascons. He was not, however, successful in winning over\r\nthe greater nobles, who, with John, count of Armagnac, at their head,\r\nwere dissatisfied with the separation from France, and looked with\r\nsuspicion upon Edward's attempts to reform the administration as being\r\nlikely to result in the curtailment of their feudal rights. Edward was\r\nbetter able to conciliate the towns, whose franchises he favoured and\r\nwhose trade he fostered, hoping that they would prove a counterpoise to\r\nthe aristocracy. He kept the chief posts of the administration mainly in\r\nEnglish hands, and never really identified himself with the local life\r\nand traditions of his principality. He succeeded in clearing Aquitaine\r\nof the free companies, and kept good peace for nearly six years.\r\n\r\nIn 1367 Peter the Cruel, the deposed king of Castile, visited Edward at\r\nBordeaux, and persuaded him to restore him to his throne by force. In\r\nFebruary 1367 Edward led an army into Spain over the pass of\r\nRoncesvalles. After a difficult and dangerous march Edward reached the\r\nEbro, and on the 3rd of April defeated Bertrand du Guesclin at Najera,\r\nthe last of his great victories. He then proceeded to Burgos, and\r\nrestored Peter to the throne of Castile. He remained in Castile for four\r\nmonths, living principally at Valladolid. His army wasted away during\r\nthe hot Spanish summer, and Edward himself contracted the beginnings of\r\na mortal disease. In August 1367 Edward led the remnant of his troops\r\nback through the pass of Roncesvalles, and returned to Bordeaux early in\r\nSeptember. He had exhausted all his resources on the Spanish expedition,\r\nand was forced to seek from the estates of Aquitaine extraordinary\r\nsources of supply. A hearth tax for five years was willingly granted to\r\nhim, and generally paid. The greater barons, however, found in this\r\nimpost a pretext for revolt. The count of Armagnac, who had already made\r\na secret understanding with Charles V., appealed against the hearth tax\r\nto the parlement of Paris. Cited before this body in January 1369,\r\nEdward declared that he would answer at Paris with sixty thousand men\r\nbehind him. War broke out again, and Edward III. resumed the title of\r\nking of France. Thereupon Charles V. declared that all the English\r\npossessions in France were forfeited, and before the end of 1369 all\r\nAquitaine was in full revolt. With weak health and impaired resources,\r\nthe Black Prince showed little activity in dealing with his insurgent\r\nsubjects, or in warding off French invasion. Though too ill to ride on\r\nhorseback, he insisted upon commanding his troops, and on the 19th of\r\nSeptember 1370 won his last barren success, by capturing the revolted\r\ncity of Limoges and putting the population to the sword. Early in 1371\r\nhe returned to England, leaving the impossible task of holding Gascony\r\nto his brother John of Gaunt. In August 1372 he joined his father in an\r\nabortive expedition to France, but contrary winds prevented their\r\nlanding, and he now abandoned military life for good. In October he\r\nresigned his principality on the ground that he could not afford to\r\nretain any longer so expensive a charge. His health now rapidly\r\ndeclined, but he still followed politics with interest, and did what he\r\ncould to support the constitutional opposition of the great\r\necclesiastics to the administration of John of Gaunt and the\r\nanti-clerical courtiers. His last public act was to inspire the attack\r\non Lancaster's influence made by the Good Parliament in the spring of\r\n1376. The famous parliament was still in session when he died at\r\nWestminster on the 8th of July. He was buried in the east end of\r\nCanterbury cathedral on the 29th of September, where his magnificent\r\ntomb, erected in accordance with the instructions in his will, may still\r\nbe seen. By Joan, \"the fair maid of Kent,\" who died on the 7th of August\r\n1385, the Black Prince left an only son, afterwards King Richard II.\r\n\r\n  For authorities see EDWARD III.
