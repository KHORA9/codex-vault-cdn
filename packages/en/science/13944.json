It became green\r\neverywhere in the first spring, after London ended, so that all the\r\ncountry looked alike.\r\n\r\nThe meadows were green, and so was the rising wheat which had been sown,\r\nbut which neither had nor would receive any further care. Such arable\r\nfields as had not been sown, but where the last stubble had been\r\nploughed up, were overrun with couch-grass, and where the short stubble\r\nhad not been ploughed, the weeds hid it. So that there was no place\r\nwhich was not more or less green; the footpaths were the greenest of\r\nall, for such is the nature of grass where it has once been trodden on,\r\nand by-and-by, as the summer came on, the former roads were thinly\r\ncovered with the grass that had spread out from the margin.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn, as the meadows were not mown, the grass withered as it\r\nstood, falling this way and that, as the wind had blown it; the seeds\r\ndropped, and the bennets became a greyish-white, or, where the docks and\r\nsorrel were thick, a brownish-red. The wheat, after it had ripened,\r\nthere being no one to reap it, also remained standing, and was eaten by\r\nclouds of sparrows, rooks, and pigeons, which flocked to it and were\r\nundisturbed, feasting at their pleasure. As the winter came on, the\r\ncrops were beaten down by the storms, soaked with rain, and trodden upon\r\nby herds of animals.\r\n\r\nNext summer the prostrate straw of the preceding year was concealed by\r\nthe young green wheat and barley that sprang up from the grain sown by\r\ndropping from the ears, and by quantities of docks, thistles, oxeye\r\ndaisies, and similar plants. This matted mass grew up through the\r\nbleached straw. Charlock, too, hid the rotting roots in the fields under\r\na blaze of yellow flower. The young spring meadow-grass could scarcely\r\npush its way up through the long dead grass and bennets of the year\r\nprevious, but docks and thistles, sorrel, wild carrots, and nettles,\r\nfound no such difficulty.\r\n\r\nFootpaths were concealed by the second year, but roads could be traced,\r\nthough as green as the sward, and were still the best for walking,\r\nbecause the tangled wheat and weeds, and, in the meadows, the long\r\ngrass, caught the feet of those who tried to pass through. Year by year\r\nthe original crops of wheat, barley, oats, and beans asserted their\r\npresence by shooting up, but in gradually diminished force, as nettles\r\nand coarser plants, such as the wild parsnips, spread out into the\r\nfields from the ditches and choked them.\r\n\r\nAquatic grasses from the furrows and water-carriers extended in the\r\nmeadows, and, with the rushes, helped to destroy or take the place of\r\nthe former sweet herbage. Meanwhile, the brambles, which grew very fast,\r\nhad pushed forward their prickly runners farther and farther from the\r\nhedges till they had now reached ten or fifteen yards. The briars had\r\nfollowed, and the hedges had widened to three or four times their first\r\nbreadth, the fields being equally contracted. Starting from all sides at\r\nonce, these brambles and briars in the course of about twenty years met\r\nin the centre of the largest fields.\r\n\r\nHawthorn bushes sprang up among them, and, protected by the briars and\r\nthorns from grazing animals, the suckers of elm-trees rose and\r\nflourished. Sapling ashes, oaks, sycamores, and horse-chestnuts, lifted\r\ntheir heads. Of old time the cattle would have eaten off the seed leaves\r\nwith the grass so soon as they were out of the ground, but now most of\r\nthe acorns that were dropped by birds, and the keys that were wafted by\r\nthe wind, twirling as they floated, took root and grew into trees. By\r\nthis time the brambles and briars had choked up and blocked the former\r\nroads, which were as impassable as the fields.\r\n\r\nNo fields, indeed, remained, for where the ground was dry, the thorns,\r\nbriars, brambles, and saplings already mentioned filled the space, and\r\nthese thickets and the young trees had converted most part of the\r\ncountry into an immense forest. Where the ground was naturally moist,\r\nand the drains had become choked with willow roots, which, when confined\r\nin tubes, grow into a mass like the brush of a fox, sedges and flags and\r\nrushes covered it. Thorn bushes were there, too, but not so tall; they\r\nwere hung with lichen. Besides the flags and reeds, vast quantities of\r\nthe tallest cow-parsnips or \"gicks\" rose five or six feet high, and the\r\nwillow herb with its stout stem, almost as woody as a shrub, filled\r\nevery approach.\r\n\r\nBy the thirtieth year there was not one single open place, the hills\r\nonly excepted, where a man could walk, unless he followed the tracks of\r\nwild creatures or cut himself a path. The ditches, of course, had long\r\nsince become full of leaves and dead branches, so that the water which\r\nshould have run off down them stagnated, and presently spread out into\r\nthe hollow places and by the corner of what had once been fields,\r\nforming marshes where the horsetails, flags, and sedges hid the water.\r\n\r\nAs no care was taken with the brooks, the hatches upon them gradually\r\nrotted, and the force of the winter rains carried away the weak timbers,\r\nflooding the lower grounds, which became swamps of larger size. The\r\ndams, too, were drilled by water-rats, and the streams percolating\r\nthrough, slowly increased the size of these tunnels till the structure\r\nburst, and the current swept on and added to the floods below. Mill-dams\r\nstood longer, but, as the ponds silted up, the current flowed round and\r\neven through the mill-houses, which, going by degrees to ruin, were in\r\nsome cases undermined till they fell.\r\n\r\nEverywhere the lower lands adjacent to the streams had become marshes,\r\nsome of them extending for miles in a winding line, and occasionally\r\nspreading out to a mile in breadth. This was particularly the case where\r\nbrooks and streams of some volume joined the rivers, which were also\r\nblocked and obstructed in their turn, and the two, overflowing, covered\r\nthe country around; for the rivers brought down trees and branches,\r\ntimbers floated from the shore, and all kinds of similar materials,\r\nwhich grounded in the shallows or caught against snags, and formed huge\r\npiles where there had been weirs.\r\n\r\nSometimes, after great rains, these piles swept away the timbers of the\r\nweir, driven by the irresistible power of the water, and then in its\r\ncourse the flood, carrying the balks before it like battering rams,\r\ncracked and split the bridges of solid stone which the ancients had\r\nbuilt. These and the iron bridges likewise were overthrown, and\r\npresently quite disappeared, for the very foundations were covered with\r\nthe sand and gravel silted up.\r\n\r\nThus, too, the sites of many villages and towns that anciently existed\r\nalong the rivers, or on the lower lands adjoining, were concealed by the\r\nwater and the mud it brought with it. The sedges and reeds that arose\r\ncompleted the work and left nothing visible, so that the mighty\r\nbuildings of olden days were by these means utterly buried. And, as has\r\nbeen proved by those who have dug for treasures, in our time the very\r\nfoundations are deep beneath the earth, and not to be got at for the\r\nwater that oozes into the shafts that they have tried to sink through\r\nthe sand and mud banks.\r\n\r\nFrom an elevation, therefore, there was nothing visible but endless\r\nforest and marsh. On the level ground and plains the view was limited to\r\na short distance, because of the thickets and the saplings which had now\r\nbecome young trees. The downs only were still partially open, yet it was\r\nnot convenient to walk upon them except in the tracks of animals,\r\nbecause of the long grass which, being no more regularly grazed upon by\r\nsheep, as was once the case, grew thick and tangled. Furze, too, and\r\nheath covered the slopes, and in places vast quantities of fern. There\r\nhad always been copses of fir and beech and nut-tree covers, and these\r\nincreased and spread, while bramble, briar, and hawthorn extended around\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nBy degrees the trees of the vale seemed as it were to invade and march\r\nup the hills, and, as we see in our time, in many places the downs are\r\nhidden altogether with a stunted kind of forest. But all the above\r\nhappened in the time of the first generation. Besides these things a\r\ngreat physical change took place; but before I speak of that, it will be\r\nbest to relate what effects were produced upon animals and men.\r\n\r\nIn the first years after the fields were left to themselves, the fallen\r\nand over-ripe corn crops became the resort of innumerable mice. They\r\nswarmed to an incredible degree, not only devouring the grain upon the\r\nstraw that had never been cut, but clearing out every single ear in the\r\nwheat-ricks that were standing about the country. Nothing remained in\r\nthese ricks but straw, pierced with tunnels and runs, the home and\r\nbreeding-place of mice, which thence poured forth into the fields. Such\r\ngrain as had been left in barns and granaries, in mills, and in\r\nwarehouses of the deserted towns, disappeared in the same manner.\r\n\r\nWhen men tried to raise crops in small gardens and enclosures for their\r\nsustenance, these legions of mice rushed in and destroyed the produce of\r\ntheir labour. Nothing could keep them out, and if a score were killed, a\r\nhundred more supplied their place. These mice were preyed upon by\r\nkestrel hawks, owls, and weasels; but at first they made little or no\r\nappreciable difference. In a few years, however, the weasels, having\r\nsuch a superabundance of food, trebled in numbers, and in the same way\r\nthe hawks, owls, and foxes increased. There was then some relief, but\r\neven now at intervals districts are invaded, and the granaries and the\r\nstanding corn suffer from these depredations.\r\n\r\nThis does not happen every year, but only at intervals, for it is\r\nnoticed that mice abound very much more in some seasons than others. The\r\nextraordinary multiplication of these creatures was the means of\r\nproviding food for the cats that had been abandoned in the towns, and\r\ncame forth into the country in droves. Feeding on the mice, they became,\r\nin a very short time, quite wild, and their descendants now roam the\r\nforest.\r\n\r\nIn our houses we still have several varieties of the domestic cat, such\r\nas the tortoise-shell, which is the most prized, but when the\r\nabove-mentioned cats became wild, after a while the several varieties\r\ndisappeared, and left but one wild kind. Those which are now so often\r\nseen in the forest, and which do so much mischief about houses and\r\nenclosures, are almost all greyish, some being striped, and they are\r\nalso much longer in the body than the tame. A few are jet black; their\r\nskins are then preferred by hunters.\r\n\r\nThough the forest cat retires from the sight of man as much as possible,\r\nyet it is extremely fierce in defence of its young, and instances have\r\nbeen known where travellers in the woods have been attacked upon\r\nunwittingly approaching their dens. Dropping from the boughs of a tree\r\nupon the shoulders, the creature flies at the face, inflicting deep\r\nscratches and bites, exceedingly painful, and sometimes dangerous, from\r\nthe tendency to fester. But such cases are rare, and the reason the\r\nforest cat is so detested is because it preys upon fowls and poultry,\r\nmounting with ease the trees or places where they roost.\r\n\r\nAlmost worse than the mice were the rats, which came out of the old\r\ncities in such vast numbers that the people who survived and saw them\r\nare related to have fled in fear. This terror, however, did not last so\r\nlong as the evil of the mice, for the rats, probably not finding\r\nsufficient food when together, scattered abroad, and were destroyed\r\nsingly by the cats and dogs, who slew them by thousands, far more than\r\nthey could afterwards eat, so that the carcases were left to decay. It\r\nis said that, overcome with hunger, these armies of rats in some cases\r\nfell upon each other, and fed on their own kindred. They are still\r\nnumerous, but do not appear to do the same amount of damage as is\r\noccasionally caused by the mice, when the latter invade the cultivated\r\nlands.\r\n\r\nThe dogs, of course, like the cats, were forced by starvation into the\r\nfields, where they perished in incredible numbers. Of many species of\r\ndogs which are stated to have been plentiful among the ancients, we have\r\nnow nothing but the name. The poodle is extinct, the Maltese terrier,\r\nthe Pomeranian, the Italian greyhound, and, it is believed, great\r\nnumbers of crosses and mongrels have utterly disappeared. There was none\r\nto feed them, and they could not find food for themselves, nor could\r\nthey stand the rigour of the winter when exposed to the frost in the\r\nopen air.\r\n\r\nSome kinds, more hardy and fitted by nature for the chase, became wild,\r\nand their descendants are now found in the woods. Of these, there are\r\nthree sorts which keep apart from each other, and are thought not to\r\ninterbreed. The most numerous are the black. The black wood-dog is short\r\nand stoutly made, with shaggy hair, sometimes marked with white patches.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that it is the descendant of the ancient\r\nsheep-dog, for it is known that the sheep-dog was of that character, and\r\nit is said that those who used to keep sheep soon found their dogs\r\nabandon the fold, and join the wild troops that fell upon the sheep. The\r\nblack wood-dogs hunt in packs of ten or more (as many as forty have been\r\ncounted), and are the pest of the farmer, for, unless his flocks are\r\nprotected at night within stockades or enclosures, they are certain to\r\nbe attacked. Not satisfied with killing enough to satisfy hunger, these\r\ndogs tear and mangle for sheer delight of blood, and will destroy twenty\r\ntimes as many as they can eat, leaving the miserably torn carcases on\r\nthe field. Nor are the sheep always safe by day if the wood-dogs happen\r\nto be hungry. The shepherd is, therefore, usually accompanied by two or\r\nthree mastiffs, of whose great size and strength the others stand in\r\nawe. At night, and when in large packs, starving in the snow, not even\r\nthe mastiffs can check them.\r\n\r\nNo wood-dog, of any kind, has ever been known to attack man, and the\r\nhunter in the forest hears their bark in every direction without fear.\r\nIt is, nevertheless, best to retire out of their way when charging sheep\r\nin packs, for they then seem seized with a blind fury, and some who have\r\nendeavoured to fight them have been thrown down and seriously mauled.\r\nBut this has been in the blindness of their rush; no instance has ever\r\nbeen known of their purposely attacking man.\r\n\r\nThese black wood-dogs will also chase and finally pull down cattle, if\r\nthey can get within the enclosures, and even horses have fallen victims\r\nto their untiring thirst for blood. Not even the wild cattle can always\r\nescape, despite their strength, and they have been known to run down\r\nstags, though not their usual quarry.\r\n\r\nThe next kind of wild wood-dog is the yellow, a smaller animal, with\r\nsmooth hair inclining to a yellow colour, which lives principally upon\r\ngame, chasing all, from the hare to the stag. It is as swift, or nearly\r\nas swift, as the greyhound, and possesses greater endurance. In coursing\r\nthe hare, it not uncommonly happens that these dogs start from the brake\r\nand take the hare, when nearly exhausted, from the hunter's hounds. They\r\nwill in the same way follow a stag, which has been almost run down by\r\nthe hunters, and bring him to bay, though in this case they lose their\r\nbooty, dispersing through fear of man, when the hunters come up in a\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nBut such is their love of the chase, that they are known to assemble\r\nfrom their lairs at the distant sound of the horn, and, as the hunters\r\nride through the woods, they often see the yellow dogs flitting along\r\nside by side with them through bush and fern. These animals sometimes\r\nhunt singly, sometimes in couples, and as the season advances, and\r\nwinter approaches, in packs of eight or twelve. They never attack sheep\r\nor cattle, and avoid man, except when they perceive he is engaged in the\r\nchase. There is little doubt that they are the descendants of the dogs\r\nwhich the ancients called lurchers, crossed, perhaps, with the\r\ngreyhound, and possibly other breeds. When the various species of dogs\r\nwere thrown on their own resources, those only withstood the exposure\r\nand hardships which were naturally hardy, and possessed natural aptitude\r\nfor the chase.\r\n\r\nThe third species of wood-dog is the white. They are low on the legs, of\r\na dingy white colour, and much smaller than the other two. They neither\r\nattack cattle nor game, though fond of hunting rabbits. This dog is, in\r\nfact, a scavenger, living upon the carcases of dead sheep and animals,\r\nwhich are found picked clean in the night. For this purpose it haunts\r\nthe neighbourhood of habitations, and prowls in the evening over heaps\r\nof refuse, scampering away at the least alarm, for it is extremely\r\ntimid.\r\n\r\nIt is perfectly harmless, for even the poultry do not dread it, and it\r\nwill not face a tame cat, if by chance the two meet. It is rarely met\r\nwith far from habitations, though it will accompany an army on the\r\nmarch. It may be said to remain in one district. The black and yellow\r\ndogs, on the contrary, roam about the forest without apparent home. One\r\nday the hunter sees signs of their presence, and perhaps may, for a\r\nmonth afterwards, not so much as hear a bark.\r\n\r\nThis uncertainty in the case of the black dog is the bane of the\r\nshepherds; for, not seeing or hearing anything of the enemy for months\r\naltogether, in spite of former experience their vigilance relaxes, and\r\nsuddenly, while they sleep, their flocks are scattered. We still have,\r\namong tame dogs, the mastiff, terrier, spaniel, deerhound, and\r\ngreyhound, all of which are as faithful to man as ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nWILD ANIMALS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the ancients departed, great numbers of their cattle perished. It\r\nwas not so much the want of food as the inability to endure exposure\r\nthat caused their death; a few winters are related to have so reduced\r\nthem that they died by hundreds, many mangled by dogs. The hardiest that\r\nremained became perfectly wild, and the wood cattle are now more\r\ndifficult to approach than deer.\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds, the white and the black. The white (sometimes dun)\r\nare believed to be the survivors of the domestic roan-and-white, for the\r\ncattle in our enclosures at the present day are of that colour. The\r\nblack are smaller, and are doubtless little changed from their state in\r\nthe olden times, except that they are wild. These latter are timid,\r\nunless accompanied by a calf, and are rarely known to turn upon their\r\npursuers. But the white are fierce at all times; they will not, indeed,\r\nattack man, but will scarcely run from him, and it is not always safe to\r\ncross their haunts.\r\n\r\nThe bulls are savage beyond measure at certain seasons of the year. If\r\nthey see men at a distance, they retire; if they come unexpectedly face\r\nto face, they attack. This characteristic enables those who travel\r\nthrough districts known to be haunted by white cattle to provide against\r\nan encounter, for, by occasionally blowing a horn, the herd that may be\r\nin the vicinity is dispersed. There are not often more than twenty in a\r\nherd. The hides of the dun are highly prized, both for their intrinsic\r\nvalue, and as proofs of skill and courage, so much so that you shall\r\nhardly buy a skin for all the money you may offer; and the horns are\r\nlikewise trophies. The white or dun bull is the monarch of our forests.\r\n\r\nFour kinds of wild pigs are found. The most numerous, or at least the\r\nmost often seen, as it lies about our enclosures, is the common\r\nthorn-hog. It is the largest of the wild pigs, long-bodied and\r\nflat-sided, in colour much the hue of the mud in which it wallows. To\r\nthe agriculturist it is the greatest pest, destroying or damaging all\r\nkinds of crops, and routing up the gardens. It is with difficulty kept\r\nout by palisading, for if there be a weak place in the wooden framework,\r\nthe strong snout of the animal is sure to undermine and work a passage\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\nAs there are always so many of these pigs round about inhabited places\r\nand cultivated fields, constant care is required, for they instantly\r\ndiscover an opening. From their habit of haunting the thickets and bush\r\nwhich come up to the verge of the enclosures, they have obtained the\r\nname of thorn-hogs. Some reach an immense size, and they are very\r\nprolific, so that it is impossible to destroy them. The boars are fierce\r\nat a particular season, but never attack unless provoked to do so. But\r\nwhen driven to bay they are the most dangerous of the boars, on account\r\nof their vast size and weight. They are of a sluggish disposition, and\r\nwill not rise from their lairs unless forced to do so.\r\n\r\nThe next kind is the white hog, which has much the same habits as the\r\nformer, except that it is usually found in moist places, near lakes and\r\nrivers, and is often called the marsh-pig. The third kind is perfectly\r\nblack, much smaller in size, and very active, affording by far the best\r\nsport, and also the best food when killed. As they are found on the\r\nhills where the ground is somewhat more open, horses can follow freely,\r\nand the chase becomes exciting. By some it is called the hill-hog, from\r\nthe locality it frequents. The small tusks of the black boar are used\r\nfor many ornamental purposes.\r\n\r\nThese three species are considered to be the descendants of the various\r\ndomestic pigs of the ancients, but the fourth, or grey, is thought to be\r\nthe true wild boar. It is seldom seen, but is most common in the\r\nsouth-western forests, where, from the quantity of fern, it is called\r\nthe fern-pig. This kind is believed to represent the true wild boar,\r\nwhich was extinct, or merged in the domestic hog among the ancients,\r\nexcept in that neighbourhood where the strain remained.\r\n\r\nWith wild times, the wild habits have returned, and the grey boar is at\r\nonce the most difficult of access, and the most ready to encounter\r\neither dogs or men. Although the first, or thorn-hog, does the most\r\ndamage to the agriculturist because of its numbers, and its habit of\r\nhaunting the neighbourhood of enclosures, the others are equally\r\ninjurious if they chance to enter the cultivated fields.\r\n\r\nThe three principal kinds of wild sheep are the horned, the thyme, and\r\nthe meadow. The thyme sheep are the smallest, and haunt the highest\r\nhills in the south, where, feeding on the sweet herbage of the ridges,\r\ntheir flesh is said to acquire a flavour of wild thyme. They move in\r\nsmall flocks of not more than thirty, and are the most difficult to\r\napproach, being far more wary than deer, so continuously are they hunted\r\nby the wood-dogs. The horned are larger, and move in greater numbers; as\r\nmany as two hundred are sometimes seen together.\r\n\r\nThey are found on the lower slopes and plains, and in the woods. The\r\nmeadow sheep have long shaggy wool, which is made into various articles\r\nof clothing, but they are not numerous. They haunt river sides, and the\r\nshores of lakes and ponds. None of these are easily got at, on account\r\nof the wood-dogs; but the rams of the horned kind are reputed to\r\nsometimes turn upon the pursuing pack, and butt them to death. In the\r\nextremity of their terror whole flocks of wild sheep have been driven\r\nover precipices and into quagmires and torrents.\r\n\r\nBesides these, there are several other species whose haunt is local. On\r\nthe islands, especially, different kinds are found. The wood-dogs will\r\noccasionally, in calm weather, swim out to an island and kill every\r\nsheep upon it.\r\n\r\nFrom the horses that were in use among the ancients the two wild species\r\nnow found are known to have descended, a fact confirmed by their evident\r\nresemblance to the horses we still retain. The largest wild horse is\r\nalmost black, or inclined to a dark colour, somewhat less in size than\r\nour present waggon horses, but of the same heavy make. It is, however,\r\nmuch swifter, on account of having enjoyed liberty for so long. It is\r\ncalled the bush-horse, being generally distributed among thickets and\r\nmeadow-like lands adjoining water.\r\n\r\nThe other species is called the hill-pony, from its habitat, the hills,\r\nand is rather less in size than our riding-horse. This latter is short\r\nand thick-set, so much so as not to be easily ridden by short persons\r\nwithout high stirrups. Neither of these wild horses are numerous, but\r\nneither are they uncommon. They keep entirely separate from each other.\r\nAs many as thirty mares are sometimes seen together, but there are\r\ndistricts where the traveller will not observe one for weeks.\r\n\r\nTradition says that in the olden times there were horses of a slender\r\nbuild whose speed outstripped the wind, but of the breed of these famous\r\nracers not one is left. Whether they were too delicate to withstand\r\nexposure, or whether the wild dogs hunted them down is uncertain, but\r\nthey are quite gone. Did but one exist, how eagerly it would be sought\r\nout, for in these days it would be worth its weight in gold, unless,\r\nindeed, as some affirm, such speed only endured for a mile or two.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary, having written thus far of the animals, that\r\nanything be said of the birds of the woods, which every one knows were\r\nnot always wild, and which can, indeed, be compared with such poultry as\r\nare kept in our enclosures. Such are the bush-hens, the wood-turkeys,\r\nthe galenæ, the peacocks, the white duck and the white goose, all of\r\nwhich, though now wild as the hawk, are well known to have been once\r\ntame.\r\n\r\nThere were deer, red and fallow, in numerous parks and chases of very\r\nold time, and these, having got loose, and having such immense tracts to\r\nroam over unmolested, went on increasing till now they are beyond\r\ncomputation, and I have myself seen a thousand head together. Within\r\nthese forty years, as I learn, the roe-deer, too, have come down from\r\nthe extreme north, so that there are now three sorts in the woods.\r\nBefore them the pine-marten came from the same direction, and, though\r\nthey are not yet common, it is believed they are increasing. For the\r\nfirst few years after the change took place there seemed a danger lest\r\nthe foreign wild beasts that had been confined as curiosities in\r\nmenageries should multiply and remain in the woods. But this did not\r\nhappen.\r\n\r\nSome few lions, tigers, bears, and other animals did indeed escape,\r\ntogether with many less furious creatures, and it is related that they\r\nroamed about the fields for a long time. They were seldom met with,\r\nhaving such an extent of country to wander over, and after a while\r\nentirely disappeared. If any progeny were born, the winter frosts must\r\nhave destroyed it, and the same fate awaited the monstrous serpents\r\nwhich had been collected for exhibition. Only one such animal now exists\r\nwhich is known to owe its origin to those which escaped from the dens of\r\nthe ancients. It is the beaver, whose dams are now occasionally found\r\nupon the streams by those who traverse the woods. Some of the aquatic\r\nbirds, too, which frequent the lakes, are thought to have been\r\noriginally derived from those which were formerly kept as curiosities.\r\n\r\nIn the castle yard at Longtover may still be seen the bones of an\r\nelephant which was found dying in the woods near that spot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nMEN OF THE WOODS\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far as this, all that I have stated has been clear, and there can be\r\nno doubt that what has been thus handed down from mouth to mouth is for\r\nthe most part correct. When I pass from trees and animals to men,\r\nhowever, the thing is different, for nothing is certain and everything\r\nconfused. None of the accounts agree, nor can they be altogether\r\nreconciled with present facts or with reasonable supposition; yet it is\r\nnot so long since but a few memories, added one to the other, can bridge\r\nthe time, and, though not many, there are some written notes still to be\r\nfound. I must attribute the discrepancy to the wars and hatreds which\r\nsprang up and divided the people, so that one would not listen to what\r\nthe others wished to say, and the truth was lost.\r\n\r\nBesides which, in the conflagration which consumed the towns, most of\r\nthe records were destroyed, and are no longer to be referred to. And it\r\nmay be that even when they were proceeding, the causes of the change\r\nwere not understood. Therefore, what I am now about to describe is not\r\nto be regarded as the ultimate truth, but as the nearest to which I\r\ncould attain after comparing the various traditions. Some say, then,\r\nthat the first beginning of the change was because the sea silted up the\r\nentrances to the ancient ports, and stopped the vast commerce which was\r\nonce carried on. It is certainly true that many of the ports are silted\r\nup, and are now useless as such, but whether the silting up preceded the\r\ndisappearance of the population, or whether the disappearance of the\r\npopulation, and the consequent neglect caused the silting, I cannot\r\nventure to positively assert.\r\n\r\nFor there are signs that the level of the sea has sunk in some places,\r\nand signs that it has become higher in others, so that the judicious\r\nhistorian will simply state the facts, and refrain from colouring them\r\nwith his own theory as Silvester has done. Others again maintain that\r\nthe supply of food from over the ocean suddenly stopping caused great\r\ndisorders, and that the people crowded on board all the ships to escape\r\nstarvation, and sailed away, and were no more heard of.\r\n\r\nIt has, too, been said that the earth, from some attractive power\r\nexercised by the passage of an enormous dark body through space, became\r\ntilted or inclined to its orbit more than before, and that this, while\r\nit lasted, altered the flow of the magnetic currents, which, in an\r\nimperceptible manner, influence the minds of men. Hitherto the stream of\r\nhuman life had directed itself to the westward, but when this reversal\r\nof magnetism occurred, a general desire arose to return to the east. And\r\nthose whose business is theology have pointed out that the wickedness of\r\nthose times surpassed understanding, and that a change and sweeping away\r\nof the human evil that had accumulated was necessary, and was effected\r\nby supernatural means. The relation of this must be left to them, since\r\nit is not the province of the philosopher to meddle with such matters.\r\n\r\nAll that seems certain is, that when the event took place, the immense\r\ncrowds collected in cities were most affected, and that the richer and\r\nupper classes made use of their money to escape. Those left behind were\r\nmainly the lower and most ignorant, so far as the arts were concerned;\r\nthose that dwelt in distant and outlying places; and those who lived by\r\nagriculture. These last at that date had fallen to such distress that\r\nthey could not hire vessels to transport themselves. The exact number of\r\nthose left behind cannot, of course, be told, but it is on record that\r\nwhen the fields were first neglected (as I have already described), a\r\nman might ride a hundred miles and not meet another. They were not only\r\nfew, but scattered, and had not drawn together and formed towns as at\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nOf what became of the vast multitudes that left the country, nothing has\r\never been heard, and no communication has been received from them. For\r\nthis reason I cannot conceal my opinion that they must have sailed\r\neither to the westward or to the southward where the greatest extent of\r\nocean is understood to exist, and not to the eastward as Silvester would\r\nhave it in his work upon the \"Unknown Orb\", the dark body travelling in\r\nspace to which I have alluded. None of our vessels in the present day\r\ndare venture into those immense tracts of sea, nor, indeed, out of sight\r\nof land, unless they know they shall see it again so soon as they have\r\nreached and surmounted the ridge of the horizon. Had they only crossed\r\nto the mainland or continent again, we should most likely have heard of\r\ntheir passage across the countries there.\r\n\r\nIt is true that ships rarely come over, and only to two ports, and that\r\nthe men on them say (so far as can be understood) that their country is\r\nequally deserted now, and has likewise lost its population. But still,\r\nas men talk unto men, and we pass intelligence across great breadths of\r\nland, it is almost certain that, had they travelled that way, some echo\r\nof their footsteps would yet sound back to us. Regarding this theory,\r\ntherefore, as untenable, I put forward as a suggestion that the ancients\r\nreally sailed to the west or to the south.\r\n\r\nAs, for the most part, those who were left behind were ignorant, rude,\r\nand unlettered, it consequently happened that many of the marvellous\r\nthings which the ancients did, and the secrets of their science, are\r\nknown to us by name only, and, indeed, hardly by name. It has happened\r\nto us in our turn as it happened to the ancients. For they were aware\r\nthat in times before their own the art of making glass malleable had\r\nbeen discovered, so that it could be beaten into shape like copper. But\r\nthe manner in which it was accomplished was entirely unknown to them;\r\nthe fact was on record, but the cause lost. So now we know that those\r\nwho to us are the ancients had a way of making diamonds and precious\r\nstones out of black and lustreless charcoal, a fact which approaches the\r\nincredible. Still, we do not doubt it, though we cannot imagine by what\r\nmeans it was carried out.\r\n\r\nThey also sent intelligence to the utmost parts of the earth along wires\r\nwhich were not tubular, but solid, and therefore could not transmit\r\nsound, and yet the person who received the message could hear and\r\nrecognise the voice of the sender a thousand miles away. With certain\r\nmachines worked by fire, they traversed the land swift as the swallow\r\nglides through the sky, but of these things not a relic remains to us.\r\nWhat metal-work or wheels or bars of iron were left, and might have\r\ngiven us a clue, were all broken up and melted down for use in other\r\nways when metal became scarce.\r\n\r\nMounds of earth are said to still exist in the woods, which originally\r\nformed the roads for these machines, but they are now so low, and so\r\ncovered with thickets, that nothing can be learnt from them; and,\r\nindeed, though I have heard of their existence, I have never seen one.\r\nGreat holes were made through the very hills for the passage of the iron\r\nchariot, but they are now blocked by the falling roofs, nor dare any one\r\nexplore such parts as may yet be open. Where are the wonderful\r\nstructures with which the men of those days were lifted to the skies,\r\nrising above the clouds? These marvellous things are to us little more\r\nthan fables of the giants and of the old gods that walked upon the\r\nearth, which were fables even to those whom we call the ancients.\r\n\r\nIndeed, we have fuller knowledge of those extremely ancient times than\r\nof the people who immediately preceded us, and the Romans and the Greeks\r\nare more familiar to us than the men who rode in the iron chariots and\r\nmounted to the skies. The reason why so many arts and sciences were lost\r\nwas because, as I have previously said, the most of those who were left\r\nin the country were ignorant, rude, and unlettered. They had seen the\r\niron chariots, but did not understand the method of their construction,\r\nand could not hand down the knowledge they did not themselves possess.\r\nThe magic wires of intelligence passed through their villages, but they\r\ndid not know how to work them.\r\n\r\nThe cunning artificers of the cities all departed, and everything fell\r\nquickly into barbarism; nor could it be wondered at, for the few and\r\nscattered people of those days had enough to do to preserve their lives.\r\nCommunication between one place and another was absolutely cut off, and\r\nif one perchance did recollect something that might have been of use, he\r\ncould not confer with another who knew the other part, and thus between\r\nthem reconstruct the machine. In the second generation even these\r\ndisjointed memories died out.\r\n\r\nAt first it is supposed that those who remained behind existed upon the\r\ngrain in the warehouses, and what they could thresh by the flail from\r\nthe crops left neglected in the fields. But as the provisions in the\r\nwarehouses were consumed or spoiled, they hunted the animals, lately\r\ntame and as yet but half wild. As these grew less in number and\r\ndifficult to overtake, they set to work again to till the ground, and\r\ncleared away small portions of the earth, encumbered already with\r\nbrambles and thistles. Some grew corn, and some took charge of sheep.\r\nThus, in time, places far apart from each other were settled, and towns\r\nwere built; towns, indeed, we call them to distinguish them from the\r\nchampaign, but they are not worthy of the name in comparison with the\r\nmighty cities of old time.\r\n\r\nThere are many that have not more than fifty houses in the enclosure,\r\nand perhaps no other station within a day's journey, and the largest are\r\nbut villages, reckoning by antiquity. For the most part they have their\r\nown government, or had till recently, and thus there grew up many\r\nprovinces and kingdoms in the compass of what was originally but one.\r\nThus separated and divided, there came also to be many races where in\r\nthe first place was one people. Now, in briefly recounting the principal\r\ndivisions of men, I will commence with those who are everywhere\r\nconsidered the lowest. These are the Bushmen, who live wholly in the\r\nwoods.\r\n\r\nEven among the ancients, when every man, woman, and child could exercise\r\nthose arts which are now the special mark of nobility, _i.e._ reading\r\nand writing, there was a degraded class of persons who refused to avail\r\nthemselves of the benefits of civilization. They obtained their food by\r\nbegging, wandering along the highways, crouching around fires which they\r\nlit in the open, clad in rags, and exhibiting countenances from which\r\nevery trace of self-respect had disappeared. These were the ancestors of\r\nthe present men of the bushes.\r\n\r\nThey took naturally to the neglected fields, and forming \"camps\" as they\r\ncall their tribes, or rather families, wandered to and fro, easily\r\nsubsisting upon roots and trapped game. So they live to this day, having\r\nbecome extremely dexterous in snaring every species of bird and animal,\r\nand the fishes of the streams. These latter they sometimes poison with a\r\ndrug or a plant (it is not known which), the knowledge of which has been\r\npreserved among them since the days of the ancients. The poison kills\r\nthe fishes, and brings them to the surface, when they can be collected\r\nby hundreds, but does not injure them for eating.\r\n\r\nLike the black wood-dogs, the Bushmen often in fits of savage frenzy\r\ndestroy thrice as much as they can devour, trapping deer in wickerwork\r\nhedges, or pitfalls, and cutting the miserable animals in pieces, for\r\nmere thirst of blood. The oxen and cattle in the enclosures are\r\noccasionally in the same manner fearfully mutilated by these wretches,\r\nsometimes for amusement, and sometimes in vengeance for injuries done to\r\nthem. Bushmen have no settled home, cultivate no kind of corn or\r\nvegetable, keep no animals, not even dogs, have no houses or huts, no\r\nboats or canoes, nothing that requires the least intelligence or energy\r\nto construct.\r\n\r\nRoaming to and fro without any apparent aim or object, or any particular\r\nroute, they fix their camp for a few days wherever it suits their fancy,\r\nand again move on, no man knows why or whither. It is this uncertainty\r\nof movement which makes them so dangerous. To-day there may not be the\r\nleast sign of any within miles of an enclosure. In the night a \"camp\"\r\nmay pass, slaughtering such cattle as may have remained without the\r\npalisade, or killing the unfortunate shepherd who has not got within the\r\nwalls, and in the morning they may be nowhere to be seen, having\r\ndisappeared like vermin. Face to face the Bushman is never to be feared;\r\na whole \"camp\" or tribal family will scatter if a traveler stumbles into\r\ntheir midst. It is from behind a tree or under cover of night that he\r\ndeals his murderous blow.\r\n\r\nA \"camp\" may consist of ten or twenty individuals, sometimes, perhaps,\r\nof forty, or even fifty, of various ages, and is ruled by the eldest,\r\nwho is also the parent. He is absolute master of his \"camp\", but has no\r\npower or recognition beyond it, so that how many leaders there may be\r\namong them it is not possible even to guess. Nor is the master known to\r\nthem as king, or duke, nor has he any title, but is simply the oldest or\r\nfounder of the family. The \"camp\" has no law, no established custom;\r\nevents happen, and even the master cannot be said to reign. When he\r\nbecomes feeble, they simply leave him to die.\r\n\r\nThey are depraved, and without shame, clad in sheep-skins chiefly, if\r\nclad at all, or in such clothes as they have stolen. They have no\r\nceremonies whatever. The number of these \"camps\" must be considerable,\r\nand yet the Bushman is seldom seen, nor do we very often hear of their\r\ndepredations, which is accounted for by the extent of country they\r\nwander over. It is in severe winters that the chief danger occurs; they\r\nthen suffer from hunger and cold, and are driven to the neighbourhood of\r\nthe enclosures to steal. So dexterous are they in slipping through the\r\nbushes, and slinking among the reeds and osiers, that they will pass\r\nwithin a few yards without discovering their presence, and the signs of\r\ntheir passage can be detected only by the experienced hunter, and not\r\nalways by him.\r\n\r\nIt is observed that whatever mischief the Bushman commits, he never sets\r\nfire to any ricks or buildings; the reason is because his nature is to\r\nslink from the scene of his depredations, and flame at once attracts\r\npeople to the spot. Twice the occurrence of a remarkably severe winter\r\nhas caused the Bushmen to flock together and act in an approach to\r\nconcert in attacking the enclosures. The Bushmen of the north, who were\r\neven more savage and brutal, then came down, and were with difficulty\r\nrepulsed from the walled cities. In ordinary times we see very little of\r\nthem. They are the thieves, the human vermin of the woods.\r\n\r\nUnder the name of gipsies, those who are now often called Romany and\r\nZingari were well known to the ancients. Indeed, they boast that their\r\nancestry goes back so much farther than the oldest we can claim, that\r\nthe ancients themselves were but modern to them. Even in that age of\r\nhighest civilization, which immediately preceded the present, they say\r\n(and there is no doubt of it) that they preserved the blood of their\r\nrace pure and untainted, that they never dwelt under permanent roofs,\r\nnor bowed their knees to the prevalent religion. They remained apart,\r\nand still continue after civilization has disappeared, exactly the same\r\nas they were before it commenced.\r\n\r\nSince the change their numbers have greatly increased, and were they not\r\nalways at war with each other, it is possible that they might go far to\r\nsweep the house people from the land. But there are so many tribes, each\r\nwith its king, queen, or duke, that their power is divided, and their\r\nforce melts away. The ruler of the Bushman families is always a man, but\r\namong the gipsies a woman, and even a young girl, often exercises\r\nsupreme authority, but must be of the sacred blood. These kings and\r\ndukes are absolute autocrats within their tribe, and can order by a nod\r\nthe destruction of those who offend them. Habits of simplest obedience\r\nbeing enjoined on the tribe from earliest childhood, such executions are\r\nrare, but the right to command them is not for a moment questioned.\r\n\r\nOf the sorcerers, and particularly the sorceresses, among them, all have\r\nheard, and, indeed, the places where they dwell seem full of mystery and\r\nmagic. They live in tents, and though they constantly remove from\r\ndistrict to district, one tribe never clashes with or crosses another,\r\nbecause all have their especial routes, upon which no intrusion is ever\r\nmade. Some agriculture is practiced, and flocks and herds are kept, but\r\nthe work is entirely done by the women. The men are always on horseback,\r\nor sleeping in their tents.\r\n\r\nEach tribe has its central camping-place, to which they return at\r\nintervals after perhaps wandering for months, a certain number of\r\npersons being left at home to defend it. These camps are often situated\r\nin inaccessible positions, and well protected by stockades. The\r\nterritory which is acknowledged to belong to such a camp is extremely\r\nlimited; its mere environs only are considered the actual property of\r\nthe tribe, and a second can pitch its tents with a few hundred yards.\r\nThese stockades, in fact, are more like store-houses than residences;\r\neach is a mere rendezvous.\r\n\r\nThe gipsies are everywhere, but their stockades are most numerous in the\r\nsouth, along the sides of the green hills and plains, and especially\r\nround Stonehenge, where, on the great open plains, among the huge\r\nboulders, placed ages since in circles, they perform strange ceremonies\r\nand incantations. They attack every traveller, and every caravan or\r\ntrain of waggons which they feel strong enough to master, but they do\r\nnot murder the solitary sleeping hunter or shepherd like the Bushmen.\r\nThey will, indeed, steal from him, but do not kill, except in fight.\r\nOnce, now and then, they have found their way into towns, when terrible\r\nmassacres have followed, for, when excited, the savage knows not how to\r\nrestrain himself.\r\n\r\nVengeance is their idol. If any community has injured or affronted them,\r\nthey never cease endeavouring to retaliate, and will wipe it out in fire\r\nand blood generations afterwards. There are towns which have thus been\r\nsuddenly harried when the citizens had forgotten that any cause of\r\nenmity existed. Vengeance is their religion and their social law, which\r\nguides all their actions among themselves. It is for this reason that\r\nthey are continually at war, duke with duke, and king with king. A\r\ndeadly feud, too, has set Bushman and gipsy at each other's throat, far\r\nbeyond the memory of man. The Romany looks on the Bushman as a dog, and\r\nslaughters him as such. In turn, the despised human dog slinks in the\r\ndarkness of the night into the Romany's tent, and stabs his daughter or\r\nhis wife, for such is the meanness and cowardice of the Bushman that he\r\nwould always rather kill a woman than a man.\r\n\r\nThere is also a third class of men who are not true gipsies, but have\r\nsomething of their character, though the gipsies will not allow that\r\nthey were originally half-breeds. Their habits are much the same, except\r\nthat they are foot men and rarely use horses, and are therefore called\r\nthe foot gipsies. The gipsy horse is really a pony. Once only have the\r\nRomany combined to attack the house people, driven, like the Bushmen, by\r\nan exceedingly severe winter, against which they had no provision.\r\n\r\nBut, then, instead of massing their forces and throwing their\r\nirresistible numbers upon one city or territory, all they would agree to\r\ndo was that, upon a certain day, each tribe should invade the land\r\nnearest to it. The result was that they were, though with trouble,\r\nrepulsed. Until lately, no leader ventured to follow the gipsies to\r\ntheir strongholds, for they were reputed invincible behind their\r\nstockades. By infesting the woods and lying in ambush they rendered\r\ncommunication between city and city difficult and dangerous, except to\r\nbodies of armed men, and every waggon had to be defended by troops.\r\n\r\nThe gipsies, as they roam, make little secret of their presence (unless,\r\nof course, intent upon mischief), but light their fires by day and night\r\nfearlessly. The Bushmen never light a fire by day, lest the ascending\r\nsmoke, which cannot be concealed, should betray their whereabouts. Their\r\nfires are lit at night in hollows or places well surrounded with\r\nthickets, and, that the flame may not be seen, they will build screens\r\nof fir boughs or fern. When they have obtained a good supply of hot wood\r\ncoals, no more sticks are thrown on, but these are covered with turf,\r\nand thus kept in long enough for their purposes. Much of their meat they\r\ndevour raw, and thus do not need a fire so frequently as others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE INVADERS\r\n\r\n\r\nThose who live by agriculture or in towns, and are descended from the\r\nremnant of the ancients, are divided, as I have previously said, into\r\nnumerous provinces, kingdoms, and republics. In the middle part of the\r\ncountry the cities are almost all upon the shores of the Lake, or within\r\na short distance of the water, and there is therefore more traffic and\r\ncommunication between them by means of vessels than is the case with\r\ninland towns, whose trade must be carried on by caravans and waggons.\r\nThese not only move slowly, but are subject to be interrupted by the\r\nRomany and by the banditti, or persons who, for moral or political\r\ncrimes, have been banished from their homes.\r\n\r\nIt is in the cities that cluster around the great central lake that all\r\nthe life and civilization of our day are found; but there also begin\r\nthose wars and social convulsions which cause so much suffering. When\r\nwas the Peninsula at peace? and when was there not some mischief and\r\nchange brewing in the republics? When was there not a danger from the\r\nnorthern mainland?\r\n\r\nUntil recent years there was little knowledge of, and scarcely any\r\ndirect commerce or intercourse between, the central part and the\r\ndistricts either of the extreme west or the north, and it is only now\r\nthat the north and east are becoming open to us; for at the back of the\r\nnarrow circle or cultivated land, the belt about the Lake, there extend\r\nimmense forests in every direction, through which, till very lately, no\r\npracticable way had been cut. Even in the more civilized central part it\r\nis not to this day easy to travel, for at the barriers, as you approach\r\nthe territories of every prince, they demand your business and your\r\npapers; nor even if you establish the fact that you are innocent of\r\ndesigns against the State, shall you hardly enter without satisfying the\r\ngreed of the officials.\r\n\r\nA fine is thus exacted at the gate of every province and kingdom, and\r\nagain at the gateways of the towns. The difference of the coinage, such\r\nas it is, causes also great loss and trouble, for the money of one\r\nkingdom (though passing current by command in that territory) is not\r\nreceived at its nominal value in the next on account of the alloy it\r\ncontains. It is, indeed, in many kingdoms impossible to obtain sterling\r\nmoney. Gold there is little or none anywhere, but silver is the standard\r\nof exchange, and copper, bronze, and brass, sometimes tin, are the\r\nmetals with which the greater number of the people transact their\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nJustice is corrupt, for where there is a king or a prince it depends on\r\nthe caprice of a tyrant, and where there is a republic upon the shout of\r\nthe crowd, so that many, if they think they may be put on trial, rather\r\nthan face the risk at once escape into the woods. The League, though\r\nbased ostensibly on principles the most exalted and beneficial to\r\nhumanity, is known to be perverted. The members sworn to honour and the\r\nhighest virtue are swayed by vile motives, political hatreds, and\r\nprivate passions, and even by money.\r\n\r\nMen for ever trample upon men, each pushing to the front; nor is there\r\nsafety in remaining in retirement, since such are accused of biding\r\ntheir time and of occult designs. Though the population of these cities\r\nall counted together is not equal to the population that once dwelt in a\r\nsingle second-rate city of the ancients, yet how much greater are the\r\nbitterness and the struggle!\r\n\r\nYet not content with the bloodshed they themselves cause, the tyrants\r\nhave called in the aid of mercenary soldiers to assist them. And, to\r\ncomplete the disgrace, those republics which proclaim themselves the\r\nvery home of patriotic virtues, have resorted to the same means. Thus we\r\nsee English cities kept in awe by troops of Welshmen, Irish, and even\r\nthe western Scots, who swarm in the council-chambers of the republics,\r\nand, opening the doors of the houses, help themselves to what they will.\r\nThis, too, in the face of the notorious fact that these nations have\r\nsworn to be avenged upon us, that their vessels sail about the Lake\r\ncommitting direful acts of piracy, and that twice already vast armies\r\nhave swept along threatening to entirely overwhelm the whole\r\ncommonwealth.\r\n\r\nWhat infatuation to admit bands of these same men into the very\r\nstrongholds and the heart of the land! As if upon the approach of their\r\ncountrymen they would remain true to the oaths they have sworn for pay,\r\nand not rather admit them with open arms. No blame can, upon a just\r\nconsideration, be attributed to either of these nations that endeavour\r\nto oppress us. For, as they point out, the ancients from whom we are\r\ndescended held them in subjection many hundred years, and took from them\r\nall their liberties.\r\n\r\nThus the Welsh, or, as they call themselves, the Cymry, say that the\r\nwhole island was once theirs, and is theirs still by right of\r\ninheritance. They were the original people who possessed it ages before\r\nthe arrival of those whom we call the ancients. Though they were driven\r\ninto the mountains of the far distant west, they never forgot their\r\nlanguage, ceased their customs, or gave up their aspirations to recover\r\ntheir own. This is now their aim, and until recently it seemed as if\r\nthey were about to accomplish it. For they held all that country\r\nanciently called Cornwall, having crossed over the Severn, and marched\r\ndown the southern shore. The rich land of Devon, part of Dorset (all,\r\nindeed, that is inhabited), and the most part of Somerset, acknowledged\r\ntheir rule. Worcester and Hereford and Gloucester were theirs; I mean,\r\nof course, those parts that are not forest.\r\n\r\nTheir outposts were pushed forward to the centre of Leicestershire, and\r\ncame down towards Oxford. But thereabouts they met with the forces of\r\nwhich I will shortly speak. Then their vessels every summer sailing from\r\nthe Severn, came into the Lake, and, landing wherever there was an\r\nopportunity, they destroyed all things and carried off the spoil. Is it\r\nnecessary to say more to demonstrate the madness which possesses those\r\nprinces and republics which, in order to support their own tyranny, have\r\ninvited bands of these men into their very palaces and forts?\r\n\r\nAs they approached near what was once Oxford and is now Sypolis, the\r\narmies of the Cymry came into collision with another of our invaders,\r\nand thus their forward course to the south was checked. The Irish, who\r\nhad hitherto abetted them, turned round to defend their own usurpations.\r\nThey, too, say that in conquering and despoiling my countrymen they are\r\nfulfilling a divine vengeance. Their land of Ireland had been for\r\ncenturies ground down with an iron tyranny by our ancestors, who closed\r\ntheir lips with a muzzle, and led them about with a bridle, as their\r\npoets say. But now the hateful Saxons (for thus both they and the Welsh\r\ndesignate us) are broken, and delivered over to them for their spoil.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to deny many of the statements that they make, but\r\nthat should not prevent us from battling with might and main against the\r\nthreatened subjection. What crime can be greater than the admission of\r\nsuch foreigners as the guards of our cities? Now the Irish have their\r\nprincipal rendezvous and capital near to the ancient city of Chester,\r\nwhich is upon the ocean, and at the very top and angle of Wales. This is\r\ntheir great settlement, their magazine and rallying-place, and thence\r\ntheir expeditions have proceeded. It is a convenient port, and well\r\nopposite their native land, from which reinforcements continually\r\narrive, but the Welsh have ever looked upon their possession of it with\r\njealousy.\r\n\r\nAt the period when the Cymry had nearly penetrated to Sypolis or Oxford,\r\nthe Irish, on their part, had overrun all the cultivated and inhabited\r\ncountry in a south and south-easterly line from Chester, through Rutland\r\nto Norfolk and Suffolk, and even as far as Luton. They would have spread\r\nto the north, but in that direction they were met by the Scots, who had\r\nall Northumbria. When the Welsh came near Sypolis, the Irish awoke to\r\nthe position of affairs.\r\n\r\nSypolis is the largest and most important city upon the northern shore\r\nof the Lake, and it is situated at the entrance to the neck of land that\r\nstretches out to the straits. If the Welsh were once well posted there,\r\nthe Irish could never hope to find their way to the rich and cultivated\r\nsouth, for it is just below Sypolis that the Lake contracts, and forms a\r\nstrait in one place but a furlong wide. The two forces thus came into\r\ncollision, and while they fought and destroyed each other, Sypolis was\r\nsaved. After which, finding they were evenly matched, the Irish withdrew\r\ntwo days' march northwards, and the Cymry as far westwards.\r\n\r\nBut now the Irish, sailing round the outside of Wales, came likewise up\r\nthrough the Red Rocks, and so into the Lake, and in their turn landing,\r\nharassed the cities. Often Welsh and Irish vessels, intending to attack\r\nthe same place, have discerned each other approaching, and, turning from\r\ntheir proposed action, have flown at each other's throats. The Scots\r\nhave not harassed us in the south much, being too far distant, and those\r\nthat wander hither come for pay, taking service as guards. They are,\r\nindeed, the finest of men, and the hardiest to battle with. I had\r\nforgotten to mention that it is possible the Irish might have pushed\r\nback the Welsh, had not the kingdom of York suddenly reviving, by means\r\nwhich shall be related, valiantly thrust out its masters, and fell upon\r\ntheir rear.\r\n\r\nBut still these nations are always upon the verge and margin of our\r\nworld, and wait but an opportunity to rush in upon it. Our countrymen\r\ngroan under their yoke, and I say again that infamy should be the\r\nportion of those rulers among us who have filled their fortified places\r\nwith mercenaries derived from such sources.\r\n\r\nThe land, too, is weak, because of the multitude of bondsmen. In the\r\nprovinces and kingdoms round about the Lake there is hardly a town where\r\nthe slaves do not outnumber the free as ten to one. The laws are framed\r\nfor the object of reducing the greater part of the people to servitude.\r\nFor every offence the punishment is slavery, and the offences are daily\r\nartificially increased, that the wealth of the few in human beings may\r\ngrow with them. If a man in his hunger steal a loaf, he becomes a slave;\r\nthat is, it is proclaimed he must make good to the State the injury he\r\nhas done it, and must work out his trespass. This is not assessed as the\r\nvalue of the loaf, nor supposed to be confined to the individual from\r\nwhom it was taken.\r\n\r\nThe theft is said to damage the State at large, because it corrupts the\r\nmorality of the commonwealth; it is as if the thief had stolen a loaf,\r\nnot from one, but from every member of the State. Restitution must,\r\ntherefore, be made to all, and the value of the loaf returned in labour\r\na thousandfold. The thief is the bondsman of the State. But as the State\r\ncannot employ him, he is leased out to those who will pay into the\r\ntreasury of the prince the money equivalent to the labour he is capable\r\nof performing. Thus, under cover of the highest morality, the greatest\r\niniquity is perpetrated. For the theft of a loaf, the man is reduced to\r\na slave; then his wife and children, unable to support themselves,\r\nbecome a charge to the State, that is, they beg in the public ways.\r\n\r\nThis, too, forsooth, corrupts morality, and they likewise are seized and\r\nleased out to any who like to take them. Nor can he or they ever become\r\nfree again, for they must repay to their proprietor the sum he gave for\r\nthem, and how can that be done, since they receive no wages? For\r\nstriking another, a man may be in the same way, as they term it,\r\nforfeited to the State, and be sold to the highest bidder. A stout brass\r\nwire is then twisted around his left wrist loosely, and the ends\r\nsoldered together. Then a bar of iron being put through, a half turn is\r\ngiven to it, which forces the wire sharply against the arm, causing it\r\nto fit tightly, often painfully, and forms a smaller ring at the\r\noutside. By this smaller ring a score of bondsmen may be seen strung\r\ntogether with a rope.\r\n\r\nTo speak disrespectfully of the prince or his council, or of the nobles,\r\nor of religion, to go out of the precincts without permission, to trade\r\nwithout license, to omit to salute the great, all these and a thousand\r\nothers are crimes deserving of the brazen bracelet. Were a man to study\r\nall day what he must do, and what he must not do, to escape servitude,\r\nit would not be possible for him to stir one step without becoming\r\nforfeit! And yet they hypocritically say that these things are done for\r\nthe sake of public morality, and that there are not slaves (not\r\npermitting the word to be used), and no man was ever sold.\r\n\r\nIt is, indeed, true that no man is sold in open market, he is leased\r\ninstead; and, by a refined hypocrisy, the owner of slaves cannot sell\r\nthem to another owner, but he can place them in the hands of the notary,\r\npresenting them with their freedom, so far as he is concerned. The\r\nnotary, upon payment of a fine from the purchaser, transfers them to\r\nhim, and the larger part of the fine goes to the prince. Debt alone\r\nunder their laws must crowd the land with slaves, for, as wages are\r\nscarcely known, a child from its birth is often declared to be in debt.\r\nFor its nourishment is drawn from its mother, and the wretched mother is\r\nthe wife of a retainer who is fed by his lord. To such a degree is this\r\ntyranny carried! If any owe a penny, his doom is sealed; he becomes a\r\nbondsman, and thus the estates of the nobles are full of men who work\r\nduring their whole lives for the profit of others. Thus, too, the woods\r\nare filled with banditti, for those who find an opportunity never fail\r\nto escape, notwithstanding the hunt that is invariably made for them,\r\nand the cruel punishment that awaits recapture. And numbers, foreseeing\r\nthat they must become bondsmen, before they are proclaimed forfeit steal\r\naway by night, and live as they may in the forests.\r\n\r\nHow, then, does any man remain free? Only by the favour of the nobles,\r\nand only that he may amass wealth for them. The merchants, and those who\r\nhave license to trade by land or water, are all protected by some noble\r\nhouse, to whom they pay heavily for permission to live in their own\r\nhouses. The principal tyrant is supported by the nobles, that they in\r\ntheir turn may tyrannise over the merchants, and they again over all the\r\nworkmen of their shops and bazaars.\r\n\r\nOver their own servants (for thus they call the slaves, that the word\r\nitself may not be used), who work upon their estates, the nobles are\r\nabsolute masters, and may even hang them upon the nearest tree. And here\r\nI cannot but remark how strange it is, first, that any man can remain a\r\nslave rather than die; and secondly, how much stranger it is that any\r\nother man, himself a slave, can be found to hunt down or to hang his\r\nfellow; yet the tyrants never lack executioners. Their castles are\r\ncrowded with retainers who wreak their wills upon the defenceless. These\r\nretainers do not wear the brazen bracelet; they are free. Are there,\r\nthen, no beggars? Yes, they sit at every corner, and about the gates of\r\nthe cities, asking for alms.\r\n\r\nThough begging makes a man forfeit to the State, it is only when he has\r\nthews and sinews, and can work. The diseased and aged, the helpless and\r\nfeeble, may break the law, and starve by the roadside, because it\r\nprofits no one to make them his slaves. And all these things are done in\r\nthe name of morality, and for the good of the human race, as they\r\nconstantly announce in their councils and parliaments.\r\n\r\nThere are two reasons why the mercenaries have been called in; first,\r\nbecause the princes found the great nobles so powerful, and can keep\r\nthem in check only by the aid of these foreigners; and secondly, because\r\nthe number of the outlaws in the woods has become so great that the\r\nnobles themselves are afraid lest their slaves should revolt, and, with\r\nthe aid of the outlaws, overcome them.\r\n\r\nNow the mark of a noble is that he can read and write. When the ancients\r\nwere scattered, the remnant that was left behind was, for the most part,\r\nthe ignorant and the poor. But among them there was here and there a man\r\nwho possessed some little education and force of mind. At first there\r\nwas no order; but after thirty years or so, after a generation, some\r\norder grew up, and these men, then become aged, were naturally chosen as\r\nleaders. They had, indeed, no actual power then, no guards or armies;\r\nbut the common folk, who had no knowledge, came to them for decision of\r\ntheir disputes, for advice what to do, for the pronouncement of some\r\nform of marriage, for the keeping of some note of property, and to be\r\nunited against a mutual danger.\r\n\r\nThese men in turn taught their children to read and write, wishing that\r\nsome part of the wisdom of the ancients might be preserved. They\r\nthemselves wrote down what they knew, and these manuscripts, transmitted\r\nto their children, were saved with care. Some of them remain to this\r\nday. These children, growing to manhood, took more upon them, and\r\nassumed higher authority as the past was forgotten, and the original\r\nequality of all men lost in antiquity. The small enclosed farms of their\r\nfathers became enlarged to estates, the estates became towns, and thus,\r\nby degrees, the order of the nobility was formed. As they intermarried\r\nonly among themselves, they preserved a certain individuality. At this\r\nday a noble is at once known, no matter how coarsely he may be dressed,\r\nor how brutal his habits, by his delicacy of feature, his air of\r\ncommand, even by his softness of skin and fineness of hair.\r\n\r\nStill the art of reading and writing is scrupulously imparted to all\r\ntheir legitimate offspring, and scrupulously confined to them alone. It\r\nis true that they do not use it except on rare occasions when necessity\r\ndemands, being wholly given over to the chase, to war, and politics, but\r\nthey retain the knowledge. Indeed, were a noble to be known not to be\r\nable to read and write, the prince would at once degrade him, and the\r\nsentence would be upheld by the entire caste. No other but the nobles\r\nare permitted to acquire these arts; if any attempt to do so, they are\r\nenslaved and punished. But none do attempt; of what avail would it be to\r\nthem?\r\n\r\nAll knowledge is thus retained in the possession of the nobles; they do\r\nnot use it, but the physicians, for instance, who are famous, are so\r\nbecause by favour of some baron, they have learned receipts in the\r\nancient manuscripts which have been mentioned. One virtue, and one only,\r\nadorns this exclusive caste; they are courageous to the verge of\r\nmadness. I had almost omitted to state that the merchants know how to\r\nread and write, having special license and permits to do so, without\r\nwhich they may not correspond. There are few books, and still fewer to\r\nread them; and these all in manuscript, for though the way to print is\r\nnot lost, it is not employed since no one wants books.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE LAKE\r\n\r\n\r\nThere now only remains the geography of our country to be treated of\r\nbefore the history is commenced. Now the most striking difference\r\nbetween the country as we know it and as it was known to the ancients is\r\nthe existence of the great Lake in the centre of the island. From the\r\nRed Rocks (by the Severn) hither, the most direct route a galley can\r\nfollow is considered to be about 200 miles in length, and it is a\r\njourney which often takes a week even for a vessel well manned, because\r\nthe course, as it turns round the islands, faces so many points of the\r\ncompass, and therefore the oarsmen are sure to have to labour in the\r\nteeth of the wind, no matter which way it blows.\r\n\r\nMany parts are still unexplored, and scarce anything known of their\r\nextent, even by repute. Until Felix Aquila's time, the greater portion,\r\nindeed, had not even a name. Each community was well acquainted with the\r\nbay before its own city, and with the route to the next, but beyond that\r\nthey were ignorant, and had no desire to learn. Yet the Lake cannot\r\nreally be so long and broad as it seems, for the country could not\r\ncontain it. The length is increased, almost trebled, by the islands and\r\nshoals, which will not permit of navigation in a straight line. For the\r\nmost part, too, they follow the southern shore of the mainland, which is\r\nprotected by a fringe of islets and banks from the storms which sweep\r\nover the open waters.\r\n\r\nThus rowing along round the gulfs and promontories, their voyage is\r\nthrice prolonged, but rendered nearly safe from the waves, which rise\r\nwith incredible celerity before the gales. The slow ships of commerce,\r\nindeed, are often days in traversing the distance between one port and\r\nanother, for they wait for the wind to blow abaft, and being heavy,\r\ndeeply laden, built broad and flat-bottomed for shallows, and bluff at\r\nthe bows, they drift like logs of timber. In canoes the hunters, indeed,\r\nsometimes pass swiftly from one place to another, venturing farther out\r\nto sea than the ships. They could pass yet more quickly were it not for\r\nthe inquisition of the authorities at every city and port, who not only\r\nlevy dues and fees for the treasury of the prince, and for their own\r\nrapacious desires, but demand whence the vessel comes, to whom she\r\nbelongs, and whither she is bound, so that no ship can travel rapidly\r\nunless so armed as to shake off these inquisitors.\r\n\r\nThe canoes, therefore, travel at night and in calm weather many miles\r\naway from the shore, and thus escape, or slip by daylight among the\r\nreedy shallows, sheltered by the flags and willows from view. The ships\r\nof commerce haul up to the shore towards evening, and the crews,\r\ndisembarking, light their fires and cook their food. There are, however,\r\none or two gaps, as it were, in their usual course which they cannot\r\npass in this leisurely manner; where the shore is exposed and rocky, or\r\ntoo shallow, and where they must reluctantly put forth, and sail from\r\none horn of the land to the other.\r\n\r\nThe Lake is also divided into two unequal portions by the straits of\r\nWhite Horse, where vessels are often weather-bound, and cannot make way\r\nagainst the wind, which sets a current through the narrow channel. There\r\nis no tide; the sweet waters do not ebb and flow; but while I thus\r\ndiscourse, I have forgotten to state how they came to fill the middle of\r\nthe country. Now, the philosopher Silvester, and those who seek after\r\nmarvels, say that the passage of the dark body through space caused an\r\nimmense volume of fresh water to fall in the shape of rain, and also\r\nthat the growth of the forests distilled rain from the clouds. Let us\r\nleave these speculations to dreamers, and recount what is known to be.\r\n\r\nFor there is no tradition among the common people, who are extremely\r\ntenacious of such things, of any great rainfall, nor is there any\r\nmention of floods in the ancient manuscripts, nor is there any larger\r\nfall of rain now than was formerly the case. But the Lake itself tells\r\nus how it was formed, or as nearly as we shall ever know, and these\r\nfacts were established by the expeditions lately sent out.\r\n\r\nAt the eastern extremity the Lake narrows, and finally is lost in the\r\nvast marshes which cover the site of the ancient London. Through these,\r\nno doubt, in the days of the old world there flowed the river Thames. By\r\nchanges of the sea level and the sand that was brought up there must\r\nhave grown great banks, which obstructed the stream. I have formerly\r\nmentioned the vast quantities of timber, the wreckage of towns and\r\nbridges which was carried down by the various rivers, and by none more\r\nso than by the Thames. These added to the accumulation, which increased\r\nthe faster because the foundations of the ancient bridges held it like\r\npiles driven in for the purpose. And before this the river had become\r\npartially choked from the cloacæ of the ancient city which poured into\r\nit through enormous subterranean aqueducts and drains.\r\n\r\nAfter a time all these shallows and banks became well matted together by\r\nthe growth of weeds, of willows, and flags, while the tide, ebbing lower\r\nat each drawing back, left still more mud and sand. Now it is believed\r\nthat when this had gone on for a time, the waters of the river, unable\r\nto find a channel, began to overflow up into the deserted streets, and\r\nespecially to fill the underground passages and drains, of which the\r\nnumber and extent was beyond all the power of words to describe. These,\r\nby the force of the water, were burst up, and the houses fell in.\r\n\r\nFor this marvellous city, of which such legends are related, was after\r\nall only of brick, and when the ivy grew over and trees and shrubs\r\nsprang up, and, lastly, the waters underneath burst in, this huge\r\nmetropolis was soon overthrown. At this day all those parts which were\r\nbuilt upon low ground are marshes and swamps. Those houses that were\r\nupon high ground were, of course, like the other towns, ransacked of all\r\nthey contained by the remnant that was left; the iron, too, was\r\nextracted. Trees growing up by them in time cracked the walls, and they\r\nfell in. Trees and bushes covered them; ivy and nettles concealed the\r\ncrumbling masses of brick.\r\n\r\nThe same was the case with the lesser cities and towns whose sites are\r\nknown in the woods. For though many of our present towns bear the\r\nancient names, they do not stand upon the ancient sites, but are two or\r\nthree, and sometimes ten miles distant. The founders carried with them\r\nthe name of their original residence.\r\n\r\nThus the low-lying parts of the mighty city of London became swamps, and\r\nthe higher grounds were clad with bushes. The very largest of the\r\nbuildings fell in, and there was nothing visible but trees and hawthorns\r\non the upper lands, and willows, flags, reeds, and rushes on the lower.\r\nThese crumbling ruins still more choked the stream, and almost, if not\r\nquite, turned it back. If any water ooze past, it is not perceptible,\r\nand there is no channel through to the salt ocean. It is a vast stagnant\r\nswamp, which no man dare enter, since death would be his inevitable\r\nfate.\r\n\r\nThere exhales from this oozy mass so fatal a vapour that no animal can\r\nendure it. The black water bears a greenish-brown floating scum, which\r\nfor ever bubbles up from the putrid mud of the bottom. When the wind\r\ncollects the miasma, and, as it were, presses it together, it becomes\r\nvisible as a low cloud which hangs over the place. The cloud does not\r\nadvance beyond the limit of the marsh, seeming to stay there by some\r\nconstant attraction; and well it is for us that it does not, since at\r\nsuch times when the vapour is thickest, the very wildfowl leave the\r\nreeds, and fly from the poison. There are no fishes, neither can eels\r\nexist in the mud, nor even newts. It is dead.\r\n\r\nThe flags and reeds are coated with slime and noisome to the touch;\r\nthere is one place where even these do not grow, and where there is\r\nnothing but an oily liquid, green and rank. It is plain there are no\r\nfishes in the water, for herons do not go thither, nor the kingfishers,\r\nnot one of which approaches the spot. They say the sun is sometimes\r\nhidden by the vapour when it is thickest, but I do not see how any can\r\ntell this, since they could not enter the cloud, as to breathe it when\r\ncollected by the wind is immediately fatal. For all the rottenness of a\r\nthousand years and of many hundred millions of human beings is there\r\nfestering under the stagnant water, which has sunk down into and\r\npenetrated the earth, and floated up to the surface the contents of the\r\nburied cloacæ.\r\n\r\nMany scores of men have, I fear, perished in the attempt to enter this\r\nfearful place, carried on by their desire of gain. For it can scarcely\r\nbe disputed that untold treasures lie hidden therein, but guarded by\r\nterrors greater than fiery serpents. These have usually made their\r\nendeavours to enter in severe and continued frost, or in the height of a\r\ndrought. Frost diminishes the power of the vapour, and the marshes can\r\nthen, too, be partially traversed, for there is no channel for a boat.\r\nBut the moment anything be moved, whether it be a bush, or a willow,\r\neven a flag, if the ice be broken, the pestilence rises yet stronger.\r\nBesides which, there are portions which never freeze, and which may be\r\napproached unawares, or a turn of the wind may drift the gas towards the\r\nexplorer.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of summer, after long heat, the vapour rises, and is in a\r\ndegree dissipated into the sky, and then by following devious ways an\r\nentrance may be effected, but always at the cost of illness. If the\r\nexplorer be unable to quit the spot before night, whether in summer or\r\nwinter, his death is certain. In the earlier times some bold and\r\nadventurous men did indeed succeed in getting a few jewels, but since\r\nthen the marsh has become more dangerous, and its pestilent character,\r\nindeed, increases year by year, as the stagnant water penetrates deeper.\r\nSo that now for very many years no such attempts have been made.\r\n\r\nThe extent of these foul swamps is not known with certainty, but it is\r\ngenerally believed that they are, at the widest, twenty miles across,\r\nand that they reach in a winding line for nearly forty. But the outside\r\nparts are much less fatal; it is only the interior which is avoided.\r\n\r\nTowards the Lake the sand thrown up by the waves has long since formed a\r\npartial barrier between the sweet water and the stagnant, rising up to\r\nwithin a few feet of the surface. This barrier is overgrown with flags\r\nand reeds, where it is shallow. Here it is possible to sail along the\r\nsweet water within an arrow-shot of the swamp. Nor, indeed, would the\r\nstagnant mingle with the sweet, as is evident at other parts of the\r\nswamp, where streams flow side by side with the dark or reddish water;\r\nand there are pools, upon one side of which the deer drink, while the\r\nother is not frequented even by rats.\r\n\r\nThe common people aver that demons reside in these swamps; and, indeed,\r\nat night fiery shapes are seen, which, to the ignorant, are sufficient\r\nconfirmation of such tales. The vapour, where it is most dense, takes\r\nfire, like the blue flame of spirits, and these flaming clouds float to\r\nand fro, and yet do not burn the reeds. The superstitious trace in them\r\nthe forms of demons and winged fiery serpents, and say that white\r\nspectres haunt the margin of the marsh after dusk. In a lesser degree,\r\nthe same thing has taken place with other ancient cities. It is true\r\nthat there are not always swamps, but the sites are uninhabitable\r\nbecause of the emanations from the ruins. Therefore they are avoided.\r\nEven the spot where a single house has been known to have existed, is\r\navoided by the hunters in the woods.\r\n\r\nThey say when they are stricken with ague or fever, that they must have\r\nunwittingly slept on the site of an ancient habitation. Nor can the\r\nground be cultivated near the ancient towns, because it causes fever;\r\nand thus it is that, as I have already stated, the present places of the\r\nsame name are often miles distant from the former locality. No sooner\r\ndoes the plough or the spade turn up an ancient site than those who work\r\nthere are attacked with illness. And thus the cities of the old world,\r\nand their houses and habitations, are deserted and lost in the forest.\r\nIf the hunters, about to pitch their camp for the night, should stumble\r\non so much as a crumbling brick or a fragment of hewn stone, they at\r\nonce remove at least a bowshot away.\r\n\r\nThe eastward flow of the Thames being at first checked, and finally\r\nalmost or quite stopped by the formation of these banks, the water\r\nturned backwards as it were, and began to cover hitherto dry land. And\r\nthis, with the other lesser rivers and brooks that no longer had any\r\nultimate outlet, accounts for the Lake, so far as this side of the\r\ncountry is concerned.\r\n\r\nAt the western extremity the waters also contract between the steep\r\ncliffs called the Red Rocks, near to which once existed the city of\r\nBristol. Now the Welsh say, and the tradition of those who dwell in that\r\npart of the country bears them out, that in the time of the old world\r\nthe River Severn flowed past the same spot, but not between these\r\ncliffs. The great river Severn coming down from the north, with England\r\non one bank and Wales upon the other, entered the sea, widening out as\r\nit did so. Just before it reached the sea, another lesser river, called\r\nthe Avon, the upper part of which is still there, joined it passing\r\nthrough this cleft in the rocks.\r\n\r\nBut when the days of the old world ended in the twilight of the\r\nancients, as the salt ocean fell back and its level became lower, vast\r\nsandbanks were disclosed, which presently extended across the most part\r\nof the Severn river. Others, indeed, think that the salt ocean did not\r\nsink, but that the land instead was lifted higher. Then they say that\r\nthe waves threw up an immense quantity of shingle and sand, and that\r\nthus these banks were formed. All that we know with certainty, however,\r\nis, that across the estuary of the Severn there rose a broad barrier of\r\nbeach, which grew wider with the years, and still increases westwards.\r\nIt is as if the ocean churned up its floor and cast it forth upon the\r\nstrand.\r\n\r\nNow when the Severn was thus stayed yet more effectually than the\r\nThames, in the first place it also flowed backwards as it were, till its\r\noverflow mingled with the reflux of the Thames. Thus the inland sea of\r\nfresh water was formed; though Silvester hints (what is most improbable)\r\nthat the level of the land sank and formed a basin. After a time, when\r\nthe waters had risen high enough, since all water must have an outlet\r\nsomewhere, the Lake, passing over the green country behind the Red\r\nRocks, came pouring through the channel of the Avon.\r\n\r\nThen, farther down, it rose over the banks which were lowest there, and\r\nthus found its way over a dam into the sea. Now when the tide of the\r\nocean is at its ebb, the waters of the Lake rush over these banks with\r\nso furious a current that no vessel can either go down or come up. If\r\nthey attempted to go down, they would be swamped by the meeting of the\r\nwaves; if they attempted to come up, the strongest gale that blows could\r\nnot force them against the stream. As the tide gradually returns,\r\nhowever, the level of the ocean rises to the level of the Lake, the\r\noutward flow of water ceases, and there is even a partial inward flow of\r\nthe tide which, at its highest, reaches to the Red Rocks. At this state\r\nof the tide, which happens twice in a day and night, vessels can enter\r\nor go forth.\r\n\r\nThe Irish ships, of which I have spoken, thus come into the Lake,\r\nwaiting outside the bar till the tide lifts them over. The Irish ships,\r\nbeing built to traverse the ocean from their country, are large and\r\nstout and well manned, carrying from thirty to fifty men. The Welsh\r\nships, which come down from that inlet of the Lake which follows the\r\nancient course of the Severn, are much smaller and lighter, as not being\r\nrequired to withstand the heavy seas. They carry but fifteen or twenty\r\nmen each, but then they are more numerous. The Irish ships, on account\r\nof their size and draught, in sailing about the sweet waters, cannot\r\nalways haul on shore at night, nor follow the course of the ships of\r\nburden between the fringe of islands and the strand.\r\n\r\nThey have often to stay in the outer and deeper waters; but the Welsh\r\nboats come in easily at all parts of the coast, so that no place is safe\r\nagainst them. The Welsh have ever been most jealous of the Severn, and\r\nwill on no account permit so much as a canoe to enter it. So that\r\nwhether it be a narrow creek, or whether there be wide reaches, or what\r\nthe shores may be like, we are ignorant. And this is all that is with\r\ncertainty known concerning the origin of the inland sea of sweet water,\r\nexcluding all that superstition and speculation have advanced, and\r\nsetting down nothing but ascertained facts.\r\n\r\nA beautiful sea it is, clear as crystal, exquisite to drink, abounding\r\nwith fishes of every kind, and adorned with green islands. There is\r\nnothing more lovely in the world than when, upon a calm evening, the sun\r\ngoes down across the level and gleaming water, where it is so wide that\r\nthe eye can but just distinguish a low and dark cloud, as it were,\r\nresting upon the horizon, or perhaps, looking lengthways, cannot\r\ndistinguish any ending to the expanse. Sometimes it is blue, reflecting\r\nthe noonday sky; sometimes white from the clouds; again green and dark\r\nas the wind rises and the waves roll.\r\n\r\nStorms, indeed, come up with extraordinary swiftness, for which reason\r\nthe ships, whenever possible, follow the trade route, as it is called,\r\nbehind the islands, which shelter them like a protecting reef. They drop\r\nequally quickly, and thus it is not uncommon for the morning to be calm,\r\nthe midday raging in waves dashing resistlessly upon the beach, and the\r\nevening still again. The Irish, who are accustomed to the salt ocean,\r\nsay, in the suddenness of its storms and the shifting winds, it is more\r\ndangerous than the sea itself. But then there are almost always islands,\r\nbehind which a vessel can be sheltered.\r\n\r\nBeneath the surface of the Lake there must be concealed very many\r\nancient towns and cities, of which the names are lost. Sometimes the\r\nanchors bring up even now fragments of rusty iron and old metal, or\r\nblack beams of timber. It is said, and with probability, that when the\r\nremnant of the ancients found the water gradually encroaching (for it\r\nrose very slowly), as they were driven back year by year, they\r\nconsidered that in time they would be all swept away and drowned. But\r\nafter extending to its present limits the Lake rose no farther, not even\r\nin the wettest seasons, but always remains the same. From the position\r\nof certain quays we know that it has thus remained for the last hundred\r\nyears at least.\r\n\r\nNever, as I observed before, was there so beautiful an expanse of water.\r\nHow much must we sorrow that it has so often proved only the easiest\r\nmode of bringing the miseries of war to the doors of the unoffending!\r\nYet men are never weary of sailing to and fro upon it, and most of the\r\ncities of the present time are upon its shore. And in the evening we\r\nwalk by the beach, and from the rising grounds look over the waters, as\r\nif to gaze upon their loveliness were reward to us for the labour of the\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart II\r\n\r\nWILD ENGLAND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nSIR FELIX\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a bright May morning, the sunlight, at five o'clock, was pouring into\r\na room which face the east at the ancestral home of the Aquilas. In this\r\nroom Felix, the eldest of the three sons of the Baron, was sleeping. The\r\nbeams passed over his head, and lit up a square space on the opposite\r\nwhitewashed wall, where, in the midst of the brilliant light, hung an\r\nivory cross. There were only two panes of glass in the window, each no\r\nmore than two or three inches square, the rest of the window being\r\nclosed by strong oaken shutters, thick enough to withstand the stroke of\r\nan arrow.\r\n\r\nIn the daytime one of these at least would have been thrown open to\r\nadmit air and light. They did not quite meet, and a streak of sunshine,\r\nin addition to that which came through the tiny panes, entered at the\r\nchink. Only one window in the house contained more than two such panes\r\n(it was in the Baroness's sitting-room), and most of them had none at\r\nall. The glass left by the ancients in their dwellings had long since\r\nbeen used up or broken, and the fragments that remained were too\r\nprecious to be put in ordinary rooms. When larger pieces were\r\ndiscovered, they were taken for the palaces of the princes, and even\r\nthese were but sparingly supplied, so that the saying \"he has glass in\r\nhis window\" was equivalent to \"he belongs to the upper ranks\".\r\n\r\nOn the recess of the window was an inkstand, which had been recently in\r\nuse, for a quill lay beside it, and a sheet of parchment partly covered\r\nwith writing. The ink was thick and very dark, made of powdered\r\ncharcoal, leaving a slightly raised writing, which could be perceived by\r\nthe finger on rubbing it lightly over. Beneath the window on the bare\r\nfloor was an open chest, in which were several similar parchments and\r\nbooks, and from which the sheet on the recess had evidently been taken.\r\nThis chest, though small, was extremely heavy and strong, being dug out\r\nwith the chisel and gouge from a solid block of oak. Except a few\r\nparallel grooves, there was no attempt at ornamentation upon it. The\r\nlid, which had no hinges, but lifted completely off, was tilted against\r\nthe wall. It was, too, of oak some inches thick, and fitted upon the\r\nchest by a kind of dovetailing at the edges.\r\n\r\nInstead of a lock, the chest was fastened by a lengthy thong of oxhide,\r\nwhich now lay in a coil on the floor. Bound round and round, twisted and\r\nintertangled, and finally tied with a special and secret knot (the ends\r\nbeing concealed), the thong of leather secured the contents of the chest\r\nfrom prying eyes or thievish hands. With axe or knife, of course, the\r\nknot might easily have been severed, but no one could obtain access to\r\nthe room except the retainers of the house, and which of them, even if\r\nunfaithful, would dare to employ such means in view of the certain\r\npunishment that must follow? It would occupy hours to undo the knot, and\r\nthen it could not be tied again in exactly the same fashion, so that the\r\nreal use of the thong was to assure the owner that his treasures had not\r\nbeen interfered with in his absence. Such locks as were made were of the\r\nclumsiest construction. They were not so difficult to pick as the thong\r\nto untie, and their expense, or rather the difficulty of getting a\r\nworkman who could manufacture them, confined their use to the heads of\r\ngreat houses. The Baron's chest was locked, and his alone, in the\r\ndwelling.\r\n\r\nBesides the parchments which were nearest the top, as most in use, there\r\nwere three books, much worn and decayed, which had been preserved, more\r\nby accident than by care, from the libraries of the ancients. One was an\r\nabridged history of Rome, the other a similar account of English\r\nhistory, the third a primer of science or knowledge; all three, indeed,\r\nbeing books which, among the ancients, were used for teaching children,\r\nand which, by the men of those days, would have been cast aside with\r\ncontempt.\r\n\r\nExposed for years in decaying houses, rain and mildew had spotted and\r\nstained their pages; the covers had rotted away these hundred years, and\r\nwere now supplied by a broad sheet of limp leather with wide margins far\r\noverlapping the edges; many of the pages were quite gone, and others\r\ntorn by careless handling. The abridgment of Roman history had been\r\nscorched by a forest fire, and the charred edges of the leaves had\r\ndropped away in semicircular holes. Yet, by pondering over these, Felix\r\nhad, as it were, reconstructed much of the knowledge which was the\r\ncommon (and therefore unvalued) possession of all when they were\r\nprinted.\r\n\r\nThe parchments contained his annotations, and the result of his thought;\r\nthey were also full of extracts from decaying volumes lying totally\r\nneglected in the houses of other nobles. Most of these were of extreme\r\nantiquity, for when the ancients departed, the modern books which they\r\nhad composed being left in the decaying houses at the mercy of the\r\nweather, rotted, or were destroyed by the frequent grass fires. But\r\nthose that had been preserved by the ancients in museums escaped for a\r\nwhile, and some of these yet remained in lumber-rooms and corners,\r\nwhence they were occasionally dragged forth by the servants for greater\r\nconvenience in lighting the fires. The young nobles, entirely devoted to\r\nthe chase, to love intrigues, and war, overwhelmed Felix Aquila with\r\nridicule when they found him poring over these relics, and being of a\r\nproud and susceptible spirit, they so far succeeded that he abandoned\r\nthe open pursuit of such studies, and stole his knowledge by fitful\r\nglances when there was no one near. As among the ancients learning was\r\nesteemed above all things, so now, by a species of contrast, it was of\r\nall things the most despised.\r\n\r\nUnder the books, in one corner of the chest, was a leather bag\r\ncontaining four golden sovereigns, such as were used by the ancients,\r\nand eighteen pieces of modern silver money, the debased shillings of the\r\nday, not much more than half of which was silver and the rest alloy. The\r\ngold coins had been found while digging holes for the posts of a new\r\nstockade, and by the law should have been delivered to the prince's\r\ntreasury. All the gold discovered, whether in the form of coin or\r\njewellery, was the property of the Prince, who was supposed to pay for\r\nits value in currency.\r\n\r\nAs the actual value of the currency was only half of its nominal value\r\n(and sometimes less), the transaction was greatly in favour of the\r\ntreasury. Such was the scarcity of gold that the law was strictly\r\nenforced, and had there been the least suspicion of the fact, the house\r\nwould have been ransacked from the cellars to the roof. Imprisonment and\r\nfine would have been the inevitable fate of Felix, and the family would\r\nvery probably have suffered for the fault of one of its members. But\r\nindependent and determined to the last degree, Felix ran any risk rather\r\nthan surrender that which he had found, and which he deemed his own.\r\nThis unbending independence and pride of spirit, together with scarce\r\nconcealed contempt for others, had resulted in almost isolating him from\r\nthe youth of his own age, and had caused him to be regarded with dislike\r\nby the elders. He was rarely, if ever, asked to join the chase, and\r\nstill more rarely invited to the festivities and amusements provided in\r\nadjacent houses, or to the grander entertainments of the higher nobles.\r\nToo quick to take offence where none was really intended, he fancied\r\nthat many bore him ill-will who had scarcely given him a passing\r\nthought. He could not forgive the coarse jokes uttered upon his personal\r\nappearance by men of heavier build, who despised so slender a stripling.\r\n\r\nHe would rather be alone than join their company, and would not compete\r\nwith them in any of their sports, so that, when his absence from the\r\narena was noticed, it was attributed to weakness or cowardice. These\r\nimputations stung him deeply, driving him to brood within himself. He\r\nwas never seen in the courtyards or ante-rooms at the palace, nor\r\nfollowing in the train of the Prince, as was the custom with the\r\nyouthful nobles. The servility of the court angered and disgusted him;\r\nthe eagerness of strong men to carry a cushion or fetch a dog annoyed\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThere were those who observed this absence from the crowd in the\r\nante-rooms. In the midst of so much intrigue and continual striving for\r\npower, designing men, on the one hand, were ever on the alert for what\r\nthey imagined would prove willing instruments; and on the other, the\r\nPrince's councillors kept a watchful eye on the dispositions of every\r\none of the least consequence; so that, although but twenty-five, Felix\r\nwas already down in two lists, the one, at the palace, of persons whose\r\nviews, if not treasonable, were doubtful, and the other, in the hands of\r\na possible pretender, as a discontented and therefore useful man. Felix\r\nwas entirely ignorant that he had attracted so much observation. He\r\nsupposed himself simply despised and ignored; he cherished no treason,\r\nhad not the slightest sympathy with any pretender, held totally aloof\r\nfrom intrigue, and his reveries, if they were ambitious, concerned only\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nBut the most precious of the treasures in the chest were eight or ten\r\nsmall sheets of parchment, each daintily rolled and fastened with a\r\nribbon, letters from Aurora Thyma, who had also given him the ivory\r\ncross on the wall. It was of ancient workmanship, a relic of the old\r\nworld. A compass, a few small tools (valuable because preserved for so\r\nmany years, and not now to be obtained for any consideration), and a\r\nmagnifying glass, a relic also of the ancients, completed the contents\r\nof the chest.\r\n\r\nUpon a low table by the bedstead were a flint and steel and tinder, and\r\nan earthenware oil lamp, not intended to be carried about. There, too,\r\nlay his knife, with a buckhorn hilt, worn by everyone in the belt, and\r\nhis forester's axe, a small tool, but extremely useful in the woods,\r\nwithout which, indeed, progress was often impossible. These were in the\r\nbelt, which, as he undressed, he had cast upon the table, together with\r\nhis purse, in which were about a dozen copper coins, not very regular in\r\nshape, and stamped on one side only. The table was formed of two short\r\nhewn planks, scarcely smoothed, raised on similar planks (on edge) at\r\neach end, in fact, a larger form.\r\n\r\nFrom a peg driven into the wall hung a disc of brass by a thin leathern\r\nlace; this disc, polished to the last degree, answered as a mirror. The\r\nonly other piece of furniture, if so it could be called, was a block of\r\nwood at the side of the table, used as a chair. In the corner, between\r\nthe table and the window, stood a long yew bow, and a quiver full of\r\narrows ready for immediate use, besides which three or four sheaves lay\r\non the floor. A crossbow hung on a wooden peg; the bow was of wood, and,\r\ntherefore, not very powerful; bolts and square-headed quarrels were\r\nscattered carelessly on the floor under it.\r\n\r\nSix or seven slender darts used for casting with the hand, as javelins,\r\nstood in another corner by the door, and two stouter boar spears. By the\r\nwall a heap of nets lay in apparent confusion, some used for partridges,\r\nsome of coarse twine for bush-hens, another, lying a little apart, for\r\nfishes. Near these the component parts of two turkey-traps were strewn\r\nabout, together with a small round shield or targe, such as are used by\r\nswordsmen, snares of wire, and, in an open box, several chisels, gouges,\r\nand other tools.\r\n\r\nA blowtube was fastened to three pegs, so that it might not warp, a\r\nhunter's horn hung from another, and on the floor were a number of\r\narrows in various stages of manufacture, some tied to the straightening\r\nrod, some with the feathers already attached, and some hardly shaped\r\nfrom the elder or aspen log. A heap of skins filled the third corner,\r\nand beside them were numerous stag's horns, and two of the white cow,\r\nbut none yet of the much dreaded and much desired white bull. A few\r\npeacock's feathers were there also, rare and difficult to get, and\r\nintended for Aurora. Round one footpost of the bed was a long coil of\r\nthin hide, a lasso, and on another was suspended an iron cap, or\r\nvisorless helmet.\r\n\r\nThere was no sword or lance. Indeed, of all these weapons and\r\nimplements, none seemed in use, to judge by the dust that had gathered\r\nupon them, and the rusted edges, except the bow and crossbow and one of\r\nthe boar spears. The bed itself was very low, framed of wood, thick and\r\nsolid; the clothes were of the coarsest linen and wool; there were furs\r\nfor warmth in winter, but these were not required in May. There was no\r\ncarpet, nor any substitute for it; the walls were whitewashed, ceiling\r\nthere was none, the worm-eaten rafters were visible, and the roof tree.\r\nBut on the table was a large earthenware bowl, full of meadow orchids,\r\nblue-bells, and a bunch of may in flower.\r\n\r\nHis hat, wide in the brim, lay on the floor; his doublet was on the\r\nwooden block or seat, with the long tight-fitting trousers, which showed\r\nevery muscle of the limb, and by them high shoes of tanned but unblacked\r\nleather. His short cloak hung on a wooden peg against the door, which\r\nwas fastened with a broad bolt of oak. The parchment in the recess of\r\nthe window at which he had been working just before retiring was covered\r\nwith rough sketches, evidently sections of a design for a ship or galley\r\npropelled by oars.\r\n\r\nThe square spot of light upon the wall slowly moved as the sun rose\r\nhigher, till the ivory cross was left in shadow, but still the slumberer\r\nslept on, heedless, too, of the twittering of the swallows under the\r\neaves, and the call of the cuckoo not far distant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSE OF AQUILA\r\n\r\n\r\nPresently there came the sound of a creaking axle, which grew louder and\r\nlouder as the waggon drew nearer, till it approached a shriek. The\r\nsleeper moved uneasily, but recognising the noise even in his dreams,\r\ndid not wake. The horrible sounds stopped; there was the sound of\r\nvoices, as if two persons, one without and one within the wall, were\r\nhailing each other; a gate swung open, and the waggon came past under\r\nthe very window of the bedroom. Even habit could not enable Felix to\r\nentirely withstand so piercing a noise when almost in his ears. He sat\r\nup a minute, and glanced at the square of light on the wall to guess the\r\ntime by its position.\r\n\r\nIn another minute or two the squeaking of the axle ceased, as the waggon\r\nreached the storehouses, and he immediately returned to the pillow.\r\nWithout, and just beneath the window, there ran a road or way, which in\r\npart divided the enclosure into two portions; the dwelling-house and its\r\noffices being on one side, the granaries and storehouses on the other.\r\nBut a few yards to the left of his room, a strong gate in the enclosing\r\nwall gave entrance to this roadway. It was called the Maple Gate,\r\nbecause a small maple tree grew near outside. The wall, which surrounded\r\nthe whole place at a distance of eight or ten yards from the buildings,\r\nwas of brick, and about nine feet high, with a ditch without.\r\n\r\nIt was partly embattled, and partly loopholed, and a banquette of earth\r\nrammed hard ran all round inside, so that the defenders might discharge\r\ndarts or arrows through the embrasures, and step down out of sight to\r\nprepare a fresh supply. At each corner there was a large platform, where\r\na considerable number of men could stand and command the approaches;\r\nthere were, however, no bastions or flanking towers. On the roof of the\r\ndwelling-house a similar platform had been prepared, protected by a\r\nparapet; from which height the entire enclosure could be overlooked.\r\n\r\nAnother platform, though at a less height, was on the roof of the\r\nretainers' lodgings, so placed as especially to command the second gate.\r\nEntering by the Maple Gate, the dwelling-house was on the right hand,\r\nand the granaries and general storehouses on the left, the latter built\r\non three sides of a square. Farther on, on the same side, were the\r\nstables, and near them the forge and workshops. Beyond these, again,\r\nwere the lodgings of the retainers and labourers, near which, in the\r\ncorner, was the South Gate, from which the South Road led to the\r\ncattle-pens and farms, and out to the south.\r\n\r\nUpon the right hand, after the dwelling-house, and connected with it,\r\ncame the steward's stores, where the iron tools and similar valuable\r\narticles of metal were kept. Then, after a covered passage-way, the\r\nkitchen and general hall, under one roof with the house. The house\r\nfronted in the opposite direction to the roadway; there was a narrow\r\ngreen lawn between it and the enceinte, or wall, and before the general\r\nhall and kitchens a gravelled court. This was parted from the lawn by\r\npalings, so that the house folk enjoyed privacy, and yet were close to\r\ntheir servitors. The place was called the Old House, for it dated back\r\nto the time of the ancients, and the Aquilas were proud of the simple\r\ndesignation of their fortified residence.\r\n\r\nFelix's window was almost exactly opposite the entrance to the\r\nstorehouse or granary yard, so that the waggon, after passing it, had to\r\ngo but a little distance, and then, turning to the left, was drawn up\r\nbefore the doors of the warehouse. This waggon was low, built for the\r\ncarriage of goods only, of hewn plank scarcely smooth, and the wheels\r\nwere solid; cut, in fact, from the butt of an elm tree. Unless\r\ncontinually greased the squeaking of such wheels is terrible, and the\r\ncarters frequently forgot their grease-horns.\r\n\r\nMuch of the work of the farm, such as the carting of hay and corn in\r\nharvest-time, was done upon sleds; the waggons (there were but few of\r\nthem) being reserved for longer journeys on the rough roads. This\r\nwaggon, laden with wool, some of the season's clip, had come in four or\r\nfive miles from an out-lying cot, or sheep-pen, at the foot of the\r\nhills. In the buildings round the granary yard there were stored not\r\nonly the corn and flour required for the retainers (who might at any\r\nmoment become a besieged garrison), but the most valuable products of\r\nthe estate, the wool, hides, and tanned leather from the tan-pits,\r\nbesides a great quantity of bacon and salt beef; indeed, every possible\r\narticle that could be needed.\r\n\r\nThese buildings were put together with wooden pins, on account of the\r\nscarcity of iron, and were all (dwelling-houses included) roofed with\r\nred tile. Lesser houses, cottages, and sheds at a distance were\r\nthatched, but in an enclosure tiles were necessary, lest, in case of an\r\nattack, fire should be thrown.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later, at six o'clock, the watchman blew his horn as loudly\r\nas possible for some two or three minutes, the hollow sound echoing\r\nthrough the place. He took the time by the sundial on the wall, it being\r\na summer morning; in winter he was guided by the position of the stars,\r\nand often, when sun or stars were obscured, went by guess. The house\r\nhorn was blown thrice a day; at six in the morning, as a signal that the\r\nday had begun, at noon as a signal for dinner, at six in the afternoon\r\nas a signal that the day (except in harvest-time) was over. The watchmen\r\nwent their round about the enclosure all night long, relieved every\r\nthree hours, armed with spears, and attended by mastiffs. By day one\r\nsufficed, and his station was then usually (though not always) on the\r\nhighest part of the roof.\r\n\r\nThe horn re-awoke Felix; it was the note by which he had been accustomed\r\nto rise for years. He threw open the oaken shutters, and the sunlight\r\nand the fresh breeze of the May morning came freely into the room. There\r\nwas now the buzz of voices without, men unloading the wool, men at the\r\nworkshops and in the granaries, and others waiting at the door of the\r\nsteward's store for the tools, which he handed out to them. Iron being\r\nso scarce, tools were a temptation, and were carefully locked up each\r\nnight, and given out again in the morning.\r\n\r\nFelix went to the ivory cross and kissed it in affectionate recollection\r\nof Aurora, and then looked towards the open window, in the pride and joy\r\nof youth turning to the East, the morning, and the light. Before he had\r\nhalf dressed there came a knock and then an impatient kick at the door.\r\nHe unbarred it, and his brother Oliver entered. Oliver had been for his\r\nswim in the river. He excelled in swimming, as, indeed, in every manly\r\nexercise, being as active and energetic as Felix was outwardly languid.\r\n\r\nHis room was only across the landing, his door just opposite. It also\r\nwas strewn with implements and weapons. But there was a far greater\r\nnumber of tools; he was an expert and artistic workman, and his table\r\nand his seat, unlike the rude blocks in Felix's room, were tastefully\r\ncarved. His seat, too, had a back, and he had even a couch of his own\r\nconstruction. By his bedhead hung his sword, his most valued and most\r\nvaluable possession. It was one which had escaped the dispersion of the\r\nancients; it had been ancient even in their days, and of far better work\r\nthan they themselves produced.\r\n\r\nBroad, long, straight, and well-balanced, it appeared capable of cutting\r\nthrough helmet and mail, when wielded by Oliver's sturdy arm. Such a\r\nsword could not have been purchased for money; money, indeed, had often\r\nbeen offered for it in vain; persuasion, and even covert threats from\r\nthose higher in authority who coveted it, were alike wasted. The sword\r\nhad been in the family for generations, and when the Baron grew too old,\r\nor rather when he turned away from active life, the second son claimed\r\nit as the fittest to use it. The claim was tacitly allowed; at all\r\nevents, he had it, and meant to keep it.\r\n\r\nIn a corner stood his lance, long and sharp, for use on horse-back, and\r\nby it his saddle and accoutrements. The helmet and the shirt of mail,\r\nthe iron greaves and spurs, the short iron mace to bang at the\r\nsaddle-bow, spoke of the knight, the man of horses and war.\r\n\r\nOliver's whole delight was in exercise and sport. The boldest rider, the\r\nbest swimmer, the best at leaping, at hurling the dart or the heavy\r\nhammer, ever ready for tilt or tournament, his whole life was spent with\r\nhorse, sword, and lance. A year younger than Felix, he was at least ten\r\nyears physically older. He measured several inches more round the chest;\r\nhis massive shoulders and immense arms, brown and hairy, his powerful\r\nlimbs, tower-like neck, and somewhat square jaw were the natural\r\nconcomitants of enormous physical strength.\r\n\r\nAll the blood and bone and thew and sinew of the house seemed to have\r\nfallen to his share; all the fiery, restless spirit and defiant temper;\r\nall the utter recklessness and warrior's instinct. He stood every inch a\r\nman, with dark, curling, short-cut hair, brown cheek and Roman chin,\r\ntrimmed moustache, brown eye, shaded by long eyelashes and well-marked\r\nbrows; every inch a natural king of men. That very physical\r\npreponderance and animal beauty was perhaps his bane, for his comrades\r\nwere so many, and his love adventures so innumerable, that they left him\r\nno time for serious ambition.\r\n\r\nBetween the brothers there was the strangest mixture of affection and\r\nrepulsion. The elder smiled at the excitement and energy of the younger;\r\nthe younger openly despised the studious habits and solitary life of the\r\nelder. In time of real trouble and difficulty they would have been drawn\r\ntogether; as it was, there was little communion; the one went his way,\r\nand the other his. There was perhaps rather an inclination to detract\r\nfrom each other's achievements that to praise them, a species of\r\njealousy or envy without personal dislike, if that can be understood.\r\nThey were good friends, and yet kept apart.\r\n\r\nOliver made friends of all, and thwacked and banged his enemies into\r\nrespectful silence. Felix made friends of none, and was equally despised\r\nby nominal friends and actual enemies. Oliver was open and jovial; Felix\r\nreserved and contemptuous, or sarcastic in manner. His slender frame,\r\ntoo tall for his width, was against him; he could neither lift the\r\nweights nor undergo the muscular strain readily borne by Oliver. It was\r\neasy to see that Felix, although nominally the eldest, had not yet\r\nreached his full development. A light complexion, fair hair and eyes,\r\nwere also against him; where Oliver made conquests, Felix was\r\nunregarded. He laughed, but perhaps his secret pride was hurt.\r\n\r\nThere was but one thing Felix could do in the way of exercise and sport.\r\nHe could shoot with the bow in a manner till then entirely unapproached.\r\nHis arrows fell unerringly in the centre of the target, the swift deer\r\nand the hare were struck down with ease, and even the wood-pigeon in\r\nfull flight. Nothing was safe from those terrible arrows. For this, and\r\nthis only, his fame had gone forth; and even this was made a source of\r\nbitterness to him.\r\n\r\nThe nobles thought no arms worthy of men of descent but the sword and\r\nlance; missile weapons, as the dart and arrow, were the arms of\r\nretainers. His degradation was completed when, at a tournament, where he\r\nhad mingled with the crowd, the Prince sent for him to shoot at the\r\nbutt, and display his skill among the soldiery, instead of with the\r\nknights in the tilting ring. Felix shot, indeed, but shut his eyes that\r\nthe arrow might go wide, and was jeered at as a failure even in that\r\nignoble competition. Only by an iron self-control did he refrain that\r\nday from planting one of the despised shafts in the Prince's eye.\r\n\r\nBut when Oliver joked him about his failure, Felix asked him to hang up\r\nhis breastplate at two hundred yards. He did so, and in an instant a\r\nshaft was sent through it. After that Oliver held his peace, and in his\r\nheart began to think that the bow was a dangerous weapon.\r\n\r\n\"So you are late again this morning,\" said Oliver, leaning against the\r\nrecess of the window, and placing his arms on it. The sunshine fell on\r\nhis curly dark hair, still wet from the river. \"Studying last night, I\r\nsuppose?\" turning over the parchment. \"Why didn't you ride into town\r\nwith me?\"\r\n\r\n\"The water must have been cold this morning?\" said Felix, ignoring the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; there was a slight frost, or something like it, very early, and a\r\nmist on the surface; but it was splendid in the pool. Why don't you get\r\nup and come? You used to.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can swim,\" said Felix laconically, implying that, having learnt the\r\nart, it no more tempted him. \"You were late last night. I heard you put\r\nNight in.\"\r\n\r\n\"We came home in style; it was rather dusky, but Night galloped the\r\nGreen Miles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mind she doesn't put her hoof in a rabbit's hole, some night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not that. She can see like a cat. I believe we got over the twelve\r\nmiles in less than an hour. Sharp work, considering the hills. You don't\r\ninquire for the news.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the news to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there was a quarrel at the palace yesterday afternoon. The Prince\r\ntold Louis he was a double-faced traitor, and Louis told the Prince he\r\nwas a suspicious fool. It nearly came to blows, and Louis is banished.\"\r\n\r\n\"For the fiftieth time.\"\r\n\r\n\"This time it is more serious.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't believe it. He will be sent for again this morning; cannot you\r\nsee why?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"If the Prince is really suspicious, he will never send his brother into\r\nthe country, where he might be resorted to by discontented people. He\r\nwill keep him close at hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish the quarrelling would cease; it spoils half the fun; one's\r\nobliged to creep about the court and speak in whispers, and you can't\r\ntell whom you are talking to; they may turn on you if you say too much.\r\nThere is no dancing either. I hate this moody state. I wish they would\r\neither dance or fight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fight! who?\"\r\n\r\n\"Anybody. There's some more news, but you don't care.\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I do not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you go and live in the woods all by yourself?\" said Oliver,\r\nin some heat.\r\n\r\nFelix laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me your news. I am listening.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Irish landed at Blacklands the day before yesterday, and burnt\r\nRobert's place; they tried Letburn, but the people there had been\r\nwarned, and were ready. And there's an envoy from Sypolis arrived; some\r\nthink the Assembly has broken up; they were all at daggers drawn. So\r\nmuch for the Holy League.\"\r\n\r\n\"So much for the Holy League,\" repeated Felix.\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do to-day?\" asked Oliver, after awhile.\r\n\r\n\"I am going down to my canoe,\" said Felix.\r\n\r\n\"I will go with you; the trout are rising. Have you got any hooks?\"\r\n\r\n\"There's some in the box there, I think; take the tools out.\"\r\n\r\nOliver searched among the tools in the open box, all rusty and covered\r\nwith dust, while Felix finished dressing, put away his parchment, and\r\nknotted the thong round his chest. He found some hooks at the bottom,\r\nand after breakfast they walked out together, Oliver carrying his rod,\r\nand a boar-spear, and Felix a boar-spear also, in addition to a small\r\nflag basket with some chisels and gouges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE STOCKADE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Oliver and Felix started, they left Philip, the third and youngest\r\nof the three brothers, still at breakfast. They turned to the left, on\r\ngetting out of doors, and again to the left, through the covered passage\r\nbetween the steward's store and the kitchen. Then crossing the waggon\r\nyard, they paused a moment to glance in at the forge, where two men were\r\nrepairing part of a plough.\r\n\r\nOliver must also look for a moment at his mare, after which they\r\ndirected their steps to the South Gate. The massive oaken door was open,\r\nthe bolts having been drawn back at hornblow. There was a guard-room on\r\none side of the gate under the platform in the corner, where there was\r\nalways supposed to be a watch.\r\n\r\nBut in times of peace, and when there were no apprehensions of attack,\r\nthe men whose turn it was to watch there were often called away for a\r\ntime to assist in some labour going forward, and at that moment were\r\nhelping to move the woolpacks farther into the warehouse. Still they\r\nwere close at hand, and had the day watchman or warder, who was now on\r\nthe roof, blown his horn, would have rushed direct to the gate. Felix\r\ndid not like this relaxation of discipline. His precise ideas were upset\r\nat the absence of the guard; method, organization, and precision, were\r\nthe characteristics of his mind, and this kind of uncertainty irritated\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"I wish Sir Constans would insist on the guard being kept,\" he remarked.\r\nChildren, in speaking of their parents, invariably gave them their\r\ntitles. Now their father's title was properly \"my lord,\" as he was a\r\nbaron, and one of the most ancient. But he had so long abnegated the\r\nexercise of his rights and privileges, sinking the noble in the\r\nmechanician, that men had forgotten the proper style in which they\r\nshould address him. \"Sir\" was applied to all nobles, whether they\r\npossessed estates or not. The brothers were invariably addressed as Sir\r\nFelix or Sir Oliver. It marked, therefore, the low estimation in which\r\nthe Baron was held when even his own sons spoke of him by that title.\r\n\r\nOliver, though a military man by profession, laughed at Felix's strict\r\nview of the guards' duties. Familiarity with danger, and natural\r\ncarelessness, had rendered him contemptuous of it.\r\n\r\n\"There's no risk,\" said he, \"that I can see. Who could attack us? The\r\nBushmen would never dream of it; the Romany would be seen coming days\r\nbeforehand; we are too far from the Lake for the pirates; and as we are\r\nnot great people, as we might have been, we need dread no private\r\nenmity. Besides which, any assailants must pass the stockades first.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite true. Still I don't like it; it is a loose way of doing things.\"\r\n\r\nOutside the gate they followed the waggon track, or South Road, for\r\nabout half a mile. It crossed meadows parted by low hedges, and they\r\nremarked, as they went, on the shortness of the grass, which, for want\r\nof rain, was not nearly fit for mowing. Last year there had been a bad\r\nwheat crop; this year there was at present scarcely any grass. These\r\nmatters were of the highest importance; peace or war, famine or plenty,\r\nmight depend upon the weather of the next few months.\r\n\r\nThe meadows, besides being divided by the hedges, kept purposely cropped\r\nlow, were surrounded, like all the cultivated lands, by high and strong\r\nstockades. Half a mile down the South Road they left the track, and\r\nfollowing a footpath some few hundred yards, came to the pool where\r\nOliver had bathed that morning. The river, which ran through the\r\nenclosed grounds, was very shallow, for they were near its source in the\r\nhills, but just there it widened, and filled a depression fifty or sixty\r\nyards across, which was deep enough for swimming. Beyond the pool the\r\nstream curved and left the enclosure; the stockade, or at least an open\r\nwork of poles, was continued across it. This work permitted the stream\r\nto flow freely, but was sufficiently close to exclude any one who might\r\nattempt to enter by creeping up the bed of the river.\r\n\r\nThey crossed the river just above the pool by some stepping-stones,\r\nlarge blocks rolled in for the purpose, and approached the stockade. It\r\nwas formed of small but entire trees, young elms, firs, or very thick\r\nash-poles, driven in a double row into the earth, the first or inner row\r\nside by side, the outer row filling the interstices, and the whole bound\r\ntogether at the bottom by split willow woven in and out. This\r\ninterweaving extended only about three feet up, and was intended first\r\nto bind the structure together, and secondly to exclude small animals\r\nwhich might creep in between the stakes. The reason it was not carried\r\nall up was that it should not afford a footing to human thieves desirous\r\nof climbing over.\r\n\r\nThe smooth poles by themselves afforded no notch or foothold for a\r\nBushman's naked foot. They rose nine or ten feet above the willow, so\r\nthat the total height of the palisade was about twelve feet, and the\r\ntops of the stakes were sharpened. The construction of such palisades\r\nrequired great labour, and could be carried out only by those who could\r\ncommand the services of numbers of men, so that a small proprietor was\r\nimpossible, unless within the walls of a town. This particular stockade\r\nwas by no means an extensive one, in comparison with the estates of more\r\nprominent nobles.\r\n\r\nThe enclosure immediately surrounding the Old House was of an irregular\r\noval shape, perhaps a mile long, and not quite three-quarters of a mile\r\nwide, the house being situated towards the northern and higher end of\r\nthe oval. The river crossed it, entering on the west and leaving on the\r\neastern side. The enclosure was for the greater part meadow and pasture,\r\nfor here the cattle were kept, which supplied the house with milk,\r\ncheese, and butter, while others intended for slaughter were driven in\r\nhere for the last months of fattening.\r\n\r\nThe horses in actual use for riding, or for the waggons, were also\r\nturned out here temporarily. There were two pens and rickyards within\r\nit, one beside the river, one farther down. The South Road ran almost\r\ndown the centre, passing both rickyards, and leaving the stockade at the\r\nsouthern end by a gate, called the barrier. At the northern extremity of\r\nthe oval the palisade passed within three hundred yards of the house,\r\nand there was another barrier, to which the road led from the Maple\r\nGate, which has been mentioned. From thence it went across the hills to\r\nthe town of Ponze. Thus, anyone approaching the Old House had first to\r\npass the barrier and get inside the palisade.\r\n\r\nAt each barrier there was a cottage and a guard-room, though, as a\r\nmatter of fact, the watch was kept in peaceful times even more\r\ncarelessly than at the inner gates of the wall about the House itself.\r\nMuch the same plan, with local variations, was pursued on the other\r\nestates of the province, though the stockade at the Old House was\r\nremarkable for the care and skill with which it had been constructed.\r\nPart of the duty of the watchman on the roof was to keep an eye on the\r\nbarriers, which he could see from his elevated position.\r\n\r\nIn case of an incursion of gipsies, or any danger, the guard at the\r\nbarrier was supposed to at once close the gate, blow a horn, and exhibit\r\na flag. Upon hearing the horn or observing the flag, the warder on the\r\nroof raised the alarm, and assistance was sent. Such was the system, but\r\nas no attack had taken place for some years the discipline had grown\r\nlax.\r\n\r\nAfter crossing on the stepping-stones Oliver and Felix were soon under\r\nthe stockade which ran high above them, and was apparently as difficult\r\nto get out of as to get into. By the strict law of the estate, any\r\nperson who left the stockade except by the public barrier rendered\r\nhimself liable to the lash or imprisonment. Any person, even a retainer,\r\nendeavouring to enter from without by pole, ladder, or rope, might be\r\nkilled with an arrow or dart, putting himself into the position of an\r\noutlaw. In practice, of course, this law was frequently evaded. It did\r\nnot apply to the family of the owner.\r\n\r\nUnder some bushes by the palisade was a ladder of rope, the rungs,\r\nhowever, of wood. Putting his fishing-tackle and boar spear down, Oliver\r\ntook the ladder and threw the end over the stockade. He then picked up a\r\npole with a fork at the end from the bushes, left there, of course, for\r\nthe purpose, and with the fork pushed the rungs over till the ladder was\r\nadjusted, half within and half without the palisade. It hung by the\r\nwooden rungs which caught the tops of the stakes. He then went up, and\r\nwhen at the top, leant over and drew up the outer part of the ladder one\r\nrung, which he put the inner side of the palisade, so that on\r\ntransferring his weight to the outer side it might uphold him. Otherwise\r\nthe ladder, when he got over the points of the stakes, must have slipped\r\nthe distance between one rung and a second.\r\n\r\nHaving adjusted this, he got over, and Felix carrying up the spears and\r\ntackle handed them to him. Felix followed, and thus in three minutes\r\nthey were on the outer side of the stockade. Originally the ground for\r\ntwenty yards, all round outside the stockade, had been cleared of trees\r\nand bushes that they might not harbour vermin, or thorn-hogs, or\r\nfacilitate the approach of human enemies. Part of the weekly work of the\r\nbailiffs was to walk round the entire circumference of the stockade to\r\nsee that it was in order, and to have any bushes removed that began to\r\ngrow up. As with other matters, however, in the lapse of time the\r\nbailiffs became remiss, and under the easy, and perhaps too merciful\r\nrule of Sir Constans, were not recalled to their duties with sufficient\r\nsharpness.\r\n\r\nBrambles and thorns and other underwood had begun to cover the space\r\nthat should have been open, and young sapling oaks had risen from\r\ndropped acorns. Felix pointed this out to Oliver, who seldom accompanied\r\nhim; he was indeed rather glad of the opportunity to do so, as Oliver\r\nhad more interest with Sir Constans than himself. Oliver admitted it\r\nshowed great negligence, but added that after all it really did not\r\nmatter. \"What I wish,\" said he, \"is that Sir Constans would go to Court,\r\nand take his proper position.\"\r\n\r\nUpon this they were well agreed; it was, in fact, almost the only point\r\nupon which all three brothers did agree. They sometimes talked about it\r\ntill they separated in a furious temper, not with each other but with\r\nhim. There was a distinct track of footsteps through the narrow band of\r\nlow brambles and underwood between the stockade and the forest. This had\r\nbeen made by Felix in his daily visits to his canoe.\r\n\r\nThe forest there consisted principally of hawthorn-trees and thorn\r\nthickets, with some scattered oaks and ashes; the timber was sparse, but\r\nthe fern was now fast rising up so thick, that in the height of summer\r\nit would be difficult to walk through it. The tips of the fronds\r\nunrolling were now not up to the knee; then the brake would reach to the\r\nshoulder. The path wound round the thickets (the blackthorn being quite\r\nimpenetrable except with the axe) and came again to the river some four\r\nor five hundred yards from the stockade. The stream, which ran from west\r\nto east through the enclosure, here turned and went due south.\r\n\r\nOn the bank Felix had found a fine black poplar, the largest and\r\nstraightest and best grown of that sort for some distance round, and\r\nthis he had selected for his canoe. Stones broke the current here into\r\neddies, below which there were deep holes and gullies where alders hung\r\nover, and an ever-rustling aspen spread the shadow of its boughs across\r\nthe water. The light-coloured mud, formed of disintegrated chalk, on the\r\nfarther and shallower side was only partly hidden by flags and sedges,\r\nwhich like a richer and more alluvial earth. Nor did the bushes grow\r\nvery densely on this soil over the chalk, so that there was more room\r\nfor casting the fly than is usually the case where a stream runs through\r\na forest. Oliver, after getting his tackle in order, at once began to\r\ncast, while Felix, hanging his doublet on an oft-used branch, and\r\nleaning his spear against a tree, took his chisels and gouge from the\r\nflag basket.\r\n\r\nHe had chosen the black poplar for the canoe because it was the lightest\r\nwood, and would float best. To fell so large a tree had been a great\r\nlabour, for the axes were of poor quality, cut badly, and often required\r\nsharpening. He could easily have ordered half-a-dozen men to throw the\r\ntree, and they would have obeyed immediately; but then the individuality\r\nand interest of the work would have been lost. Unless he did it himself\r\nits importance and value to him would have been diminished. It had now\r\nbeen down some weeks, had been hewn into outward shape, and the larger\r\npart of the interior slowly dug away with chisel and gouge.\r\n\r\nHe had commenced while the hawthorn was just putting forth its first\r\nspray, when the thickets and the trees were yet bare. Now the May bloom\r\nscented the air, the forest was green, and his work approached\r\ncompletion. There remained, indeed, but some final shaping and rounding\r\noff, and the construction, or rather cutting out, of a secret locker in\r\nthe stern. This locker was nothing more than a square aperture chiselled\r\nout like a mortice, entering not from above but parallel with the\r\nbottom, and was to be closed with a tight-fitting piece of wood driven\r\nin by force of mallet.\r\n\r\nA little paint would then conceal the slight chinks, and the boat might\r\nbe examined in every possible way without any trace of this hiding-place\r\nbeing observed. The canoe was some eleven feet long, and nearly three\r\nfeet in the beam; it tapered at either end, so that it might be\r\npropelled backwards or forwards without turning, and stem and stern\r\n(interchangeable definitions in this case) each rose a few inches higher\r\nthan the general gunwale. The sides were about two inches thick, the\r\nbottom three, so that although dug out from light wood the canoe was\r\nrather heavy.\r\n\r\nAt first Felix constructed a light shed of fir poles roofed with\r\nspruce-fir branches over the log, so that he might work sheltered from\r\nthe bitter winds of the early spring. As the warmth increased he had\r\ntaken the shed down, and now as the sun rose higher was glad of the\r\nshade of an adjacent beech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE CANOE\r\n\r\n\r\nFelix had scarcely worked half an hour before Oliver returned and threw\r\nhimself on the ground at full length. He had wearied of fishing, the\r\ndelicate adjustment of the tackle and the care necessary to keep the\r\nhook and line from catching in the branches had quickly proved too much\r\nfor his patience. He lay on the grass, his feet towards the stream which\r\nran and bubbled beneath, and watched Felix chipping out the block\r\nintended to fit into the secret opening or locker.\r\n\r\n\"Is it nearly finished, then?\" he said presently. \"What a time you have\r\nbeen at it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nearly three months.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did you make it so big? It is too big.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it really? Perhaps I want to put some things in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I see; cargo. But where are you going to launch it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Below the stones there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you won't be able to go far; there's an old fir across the river\r\ndown yonder, and a hollow willow has fallen in. Besides, the stream's\r\ntoo shallow; you'll take ground before you get half a mile.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall I?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course you will. That boat will float six inches deep by herself,\r\nand I'm sure there's not six inches by the Thorns.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very awkward.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't you have a hide boat made, with a willow framework and\r\nleather cover? Then you might perhaps get down the river by hauling it\r\npast the shallows and the fallen trees. In two days' time you would be\r\nin the hands of the gipsies.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you would be Sir Constans' heir!\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, come, I say; that's too bad. You know I didn't mean that. Besides,\r\nI think I'm as much his heir as you now\" (looking at his sinewy arm);\r\n\"at least, he doesn't listen as much to you. I mean, the river runs into\r\nthe gipsies' country as straight as it can go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you seem very cool about it!\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not going down the river.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, where _are_ you going?\"\r\n\r\n\"On the Lake.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whew!\" (whistling) \"Pooh! Why, the Lake's--let me see, to Heron Bay\r\nit's quite fifteen miles. You can't paddle across the land.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I can put the canoe on a cart.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aha! why didn't you tell me before?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I did not wish anyone to know. Don't say anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not I. But what on earth, or rather, on water, are you driving at?\r\nWhere are you going? What's the canoe for?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am going a voyage. But I will tell you all when it is ready.\r\nMeantime, I rely on you to keep silence. The rest think the boat is for\r\nthe river.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will not say a word. But why did you not have a hide boat?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are not strong enough. They can't stand knocking about.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you want to go a voyage (where to, I can't imagine), why not take a\r\npassage on board a ship?\"\r\n\r\n\"I want to go my own way. They will only go theirs. Nor do I like the\r\ncompany.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, certainly the sailors are the roughest lot I know. Still, that\r\nwould not have hurt you. You are rather dainty, Sir Felix!\"\r\n\r\n\"My daintiness does not hurt you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't I speak?\" (sharply)\r\n\r\n\"Please yourself.\"\r\n\r\nA silence. A cuckoo sang in the forest, and was answered from a tree\r\nwithin the distant palisade. Felix chopped away slowly and deliberately;\r\nhe was not a good workman. Oliver watched his progress with contempt; he\r\ncould have put it into shape in half the time. Felix could draw, and\r\ndesign; he could invent, but he was not a practical workman, to give\r\nspeedy and accurate effect to his ideas.\r\n\r\n\"My opinion is,\" said Oliver, \"that that canoe will not float upright.\r\nIt's one-sided.\"\r\n\r\nFelix, usually so self-controlled, could not refrain from casting his\r\nchisel down angrily. But he picked it up again, and said nothing. This\r\nsilence had more influence upon Oliver, whose nature was very generous,\r\nthan the bitterest retort. He sat up on the sward.\r\n\r\n\"I will help launch it,\" he said. \"We could manage it between us, if you\r\ndon't want a lot of the fellows down here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you. I should like that best.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I will help you with the cart when you start.\"\r\n\r\nOliver rolled over on his back, and looked up idly at the white flecks\r\nof cloud sailing at a great height.\r\n\r\n\"Old Mouse is a wretch not to give me a command,\" he said presently.\r\n\r\nFelix looked round involuntarily, lest any one should have heard; Mouse\r\nwas the nick-name for the Prince. Like all who rule with irresponsible\r\npower, the Prince had spies everywhere. He was not a cruel man, nor a\r\nbenevolent, neither clever nor foolish, neither strong nor weak; simply\r\nan ordinary, a very ordinary being, who chanced to sit upon a throne\r\nbecause his ancestors did, and not from any personal superiority.\r\n\r\nHe was at times much influenced by those around him; at others he took\r\nhis own course, right or wrong; at another he let matters drift. There\r\nwas never any telling in the morning what he might do towards night, for\r\nthere was no vein of will or bias running through his character. In\r\nfact, he lacked character; he was all uncertainty, except in jealousy of\r\nhis supremacy. Possibly some faint perception of his own incapacity, of\r\nthe feeble grasp he had upon the State, that seemed outwardly so\r\ncompletely his, occasionally crossed his mind.\r\n\r\nHence the furious scenes with his brother; hence the sudden\r\nimprisonments and equally sudden pardons; the spies and eavesdroppers,\r\nthe sequestration of estates for no apparent cause. And, following these\r\nerratic severities to the suspected nobles, proclamations giving\r\nprivileges to the people, and removing taxes. But in a few days these\r\nwere imposed again, and men who dared to murmur were beaten by the\r\nsoldiers, or cast into the dungeons. Yet Prince Louis (the family were\r\nall of the same name) was not an ill-meaning man; he often meant well,\r\nbut had no stability or firmness of purpose.\r\n\r\nThis was why Felix dreaded lest some chance listener should hear Oliver\r\nabuse him. Oliver had been in the army for some time; his excellence in\r\nall arms, and especially with lance and sword, his acknowledged courage,\r\nand his noble birth, entitled him to a command, however lowly it might\r\nbe. But he was still in the ranks, and not the slightest recognition had\r\never been taken of his feats, except, indeed, if whispers were true, by\r\nsome sweet smiles from a certain lady of the palace, who admired\r\nknightly prowess.\r\n\r\nOliver chafed under this neglect.\r\n\r\n\"I would not say that kind of thing,\" remarked Felix. \"Certainly it is\r\nannoying.\"\r\n\r\n\"Annoying! that is a mild expression. Of course, everyone knows the\r\nreason. If we had any money, or influence, it would be very different.\r\nBut Sir Constans has neither gold nor power, and he might have had\r\nboth.\"\r\n\r\n\"There was a clerk from the notary's at the house yesterday evening,\"\r\nsaid Felix.\r\n\r\n\"About the debts, no doubt. Some day the cunning old scoundrel, when he\r\ncan squeeze no more interest out of us, will find a legal quibble and\r\ntake the lot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or put us in the Blue Chamber, the first time the Prince goes to war\r\nand wants money. The Blue Chamber will say, 'Where can we get it? Who's\r\nweakest?' 'Why, Sir Constans!' 'Then away with him.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that will be it. Yet I wish a war would happen; there would be\r\nsome chance for me. I would go with you in your canoe, but you are going\r\nyou don't know where. What's your object? Nothing. You don't know\r\nyourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you don't; you're a dreamer.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid it is true.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hate dreams.\" After a pause, in a lower voice, \"Have you any money?\"\r\n\r\nFelix took out his purse and showed him the copper pieces.\r\n\r\n\"The eldest son of Constans Aquila with ten copper pieces,\" growled\r\nOliver, rising, but taking them all the same. \"Lend them to me. I'll try\r\nthem on the board to-night. Fancy me putting down _copper!_ It's\r\nintolerable\" (working himself into a rage). \"I'll turn bandit, and rob\r\non the roads. I'll go to King Yeo and fight the Welsh. Confusion!\"\r\n\r\nHe rushed into the forest, leaving his spear on the sward.\r\n\r\nFelix quietly chipped away at the block he was shaping, but his temper,\r\ntoo, was inwardly rising. The same talk, varied in detail, but the same\r\nin point, took place every time the brothers were together, and always\r\nwith the same result of anger. In earlier days Sir Constans had been as\r\nforward in all warlike exercises as Oliver was now, and being possessed\r\nof extraordinary physical strength, took a leading part among men.\r\nWielding his battle-axe with irresistible force, he distinguished\r\nhimself in several battles and sieges.\r\n\r\nHe had a singular talent for mechanical construction (the wheel by which\r\nwater was drawn from the well at the palace was designed by him), but\r\nthis very ingenuity was the beginning of his difficulties. During a long\r\nsiege, he invented a machine for casting large stones against the walls,\r\nor rather put it together from the fragmentary descriptions he had seen\r\nin authors, whose works had almost perished before the dispersion of the\r\nancients; for he, too, had been studious in youth.\r\n\r\nThe old Prince was highly pleased with this engine, which promised him\r\nspeedy conquest over his enemies, and the destruction of their\r\nstrongholds. But the nobles who had the hereditary command of the siege\r\nartillery, which consisted mainly of battering-rams, could not endure to\r\nsee their prestige vanishing. They caballed, traduced the Baron, and he\r\nfell into disgrace. This disgrace, as he was assured by secret messages\r\nfrom the Prince, was but policy; he would be recalled so soon as the\r\nPrince felt himself able to withstand the pressure of the nobles. But it\r\nhappened that the old Prince died at that juncture, and the present\r\nPrince succeeded.\r\n\r\nThe enemies of the Baron, having access to him, obtained his confidence;\r\nthe Baron was arrested and amerced in a heavy fine, the payment of which\r\nlaid the foundation of those debts which had since been constantly\r\nincreasing. He was then released, but was not for some two years\r\npermitted to approach the Court. Meantime, men of not half his descent,\r\nbut with an unblushing brow and unctuous tongue, had become the\r\nfavourites at the palace of the Prince, who, as said before, was not\r\nbad, but the mere puppet of circumstances.\r\n\r\nInto competition with these vulgar flatterers Aquila could not enter. It\r\nwas indeed pride, and nothing but pride, that had kept him from the\r\npalace. By slow degrees he had sunk out of sight, occupying himself more\r\nand more with mechanical inventions, and with gardening, till at last he\r\nhad come to be regarded as no more than an agriculturist. Yet in this\r\nobscure condition he had not escaped danger.\r\n\r\nThe common people were notoriously attached to him. Whether this was due\r\nto his natural kindliness, his real strength of intellect, and charm of\r\nmanner, or whether it was on account of the uprightness with which he\r\njudged between them, or whether it was owing to all these things\r\ncombined, certain it is that there was not a man on the estate that\r\nwould not have died for him. Certain it is, too, that he was beloved by\r\nthe people of the entire district, and more especially by the shepherds\r\nof the hills, who were freer and less under the control of the patrician\r\ncaste. Instead of carrying disputes to the town, to be adjudged by the\r\nPrince's authority, many were privately brought to him.\r\n\r\nThis, by degrees becoming known, excited the jealousy and anger of the\r\nPrince, an anger cunningly inflamed by the notary Francis, and by other\r\nnobles. But they hesitated to execute anything against him lest the\r\npeople should rise, and it was doubtful, indeed, if the very retainers\r\nof the nobles would attack the Old House, if ordered. Thus the Baron's\r\nweakness was his defence. The Prince, to do him justice, soon forgot the\r\nmatter, and laughed at his own folly, that he should be jealous of a man\r\nwho was no more than an agriculturist.\r\n\r\nThe rest were not so appeased; they desired the Baron's destruction if\r\nonly from hatred of his popularity, and they lost no opportunity of\r\ncasting discredit upon him, or of endeavouring to alienate the\r\naffections of the people by representing him as a magician, a thing\r\nclearly proved by his machines and engines, which must have been\r\ndesigned by some supernatural assistance. But the chief, as the most\r\nimmediate and pressing danger, was the debt to Francis the notary, which\r\nmight at any moment be brought before the Court.\r\n\r\nThus it was that the three sons found themselves without money or\r\nposition, with nothing but a bare patent of nobility. The third and\r\nyoungest alone had made any progress, if such it could be called. By\r\ndint of his own persistent efforts, and by enduring insults and rebuffs\r\nwith indifference, he had at last obtained an appointment in that\r\nsection of the Treasury which received the dues upon merchandise, and\r\nregulated the imposts. He was but a messenger at every man's call; his\r\npay was not sufficient to obtain his food, still it was an advance, and\r\nhe was in a government office. He could but just exist in the town,\r\nsleeping in a garret, where he stored the provisions he took in with him\r\nevery Monday morning from the Old House. He came home on the Saturday\r\nand returned to his work on the Monday. Even his patience was almost\r\nworn out.\r\n\r\nThe whole place was thus falling to decay, while at the same time it\r\nseemed to be flowing with milk and honey, for under the Baron's personal\r\nattention the estate, though so carelessly guarded, had become a very\r\ngarden. The cattle had increased, and were of the best kind, the horses\r\nwere celebrated and sought for, the sheep valued, the crops the wonder\r\nof the province. Yet there was no money; the product went to the notary.\r\nThis extraordinary fertility was the cause of the covetous longing of\r\nthe Court favourites to divide the spoil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nBARON AQUILA\r\n\r\n\r\nFelix's own position was bitter in the extreme. He felt he had talent.\r\nHe loved deeply, he knew that he was in turn as deeply beloved; but he\r\nwas utterly powerless. On the confines of the estate, indeed, the men\r\nwould run gladly to do his bidding. Beyond, and on his own account, he\r\nwas helpless. Manual labour (to plough, to sow, to work on shipboard)\r\ncould produce nothing in a time when almost all work was done by\r\nbondsmen or family retainers. The life of a hunter in the woods was\r\nfree, but produced nothing.\r\n\r\nThe furs he sold simply maintained him; it was barter for existence, not\r\nprofit. The shepherds on the hills roamed in comparative freedom, but\r\nthey had no wealth except of sheep. He could not start as a merchant\r\nwithout money; he could not enclose an estate and build a house or\r\ncastle fit for the nuptials of a noble's daughter without money, or that\r\npersonal influence which answers the same purpose; he could not even\r\nhope to succeed to the hereditary estate, so deeply was it encumbered;\r\nthey might, indeed, at any time be turned forth.\r\n\r\nSlowly the iron entered into his soul. This hopelessness, helplessness,\r\nembittered every moment. His love increasing with the passage of time\r\nrendered his position hateful in the extreme. The feeling within that he\r\nhad talent which only required opportunity stung him like a scorpion.\r\nThe days went by, and everything remained the same. Continual brooding\r\nand bitterness of spirit went near to drive him mad.\r\n\r\nAt last the resolution was taken, he would go forth into the world. That\r\ninvolved separation from Aurora, long separation, and without\r\ncommunication, since letters could be sent only by special messenger,\r\nand how should he pay a messenger? It was this terrible thought of\r\nseparation which had so long kept him inactive. In the end the\r\nbitterness of hopelessness forced him to face it. He began the canoe,\r\nbut kept his purpose secret, especially from her, lest tears should melt\r\nhis resolution.\r\n\r\nThere were but two ways of travelling open to him: on foot, as the\r\nhunters did, or by the merchant vessels. The latter, of course, required\r\npayment, and their ways were notoriously coarse. If on foot he could not\r\ncross the Lake, nor visit the countries on either shore, nor the\r\nislands; therefore he cut down the poplar and commenced the canoe.\r\nWhither he should go, and what he should do, was entirely at the mercy\r\nof circumstances. He had no plan, no route.\r\n\r\nHe had a dim idea of offering his services to some distant king or\r\nprince, of unfolding to him the inventions he had made. He tried to\r\nconceal from himself that he would probably be repulsed and laughed at.\r\nWithout money, without a retinue, how could he expect to be received or\r\nlistened to? Still, he must go; he could not help himself, go he must.\r\n\r\nAs he chopped and chipped through the long weeks of early spring, while\r\nthe easterly winds bent the trees above him, till the buds unfolded and\r\nthe leaves expanded--while his hands were thus employed, the whole map,\r\nas it were, of the known countries seemed to pass without volition\r\nbefore his mind. He saw the cities along the shores of the great Lake;\r\nhe saw their internal condition, the weakness of the social fabric, the\r\nmisery of the bondsmen. The uncertain action of the League, the only\r\nthread which bound the world together; the threatening aspect of the\r\nCymry and the Irish; the dread north, the vast northern forests, from\r\nwhich at any time invading hosts might descend on the fertile south--it\r\nall went before his eyes.\r\n\r\nWhat was there behind the immense and untraversed belt of forest which\r\nextended to the south, to the east, and west? Where did the great Lake\r\nend? Were the stories of the gold and silver mines of Devon and Cornwall\r\ntrue? And where were the iron mines, from which the ancients drew their\r\nstores of metal?\r\n\r\nLed by these thoughts he twice or thrice left his labour, and walking\r\nsome twenty miles through the forests, and over the hills, reached the\r\nsummit of White Horse. From thence, resting on the sward, he watched the\r\nvessels making slow progress by oars, and some drawn with ropes by gangs\r\nof men or horses on the shore, through the narrow straits. North and\r\nSouth there nearly met. There was but a furlong of water between them.\r\nIf ever the North came down there the armies would cross. _There_ was\r\nthe key of the world. Excepting the few cottages where the owners of the\r\nhorses lived, there was neither castle nor town within twenty miles.\r\n\r\nForced on by these thoughts, he broke the long silence which had existed\r\nbetween him and his father. He spoke of the value and importance of this\r\nspot; could not the Baron send forth his retainers and enclose a new\r\nestate there? There was nothing to prevent him. The forest was free to\r\nall, provided that they rendered due service to the Prince. Might not a\r\nhouse or castle built there become the beginning of a city? The Baron\r\nlistened, and then said he must go and see that a new hatch was put in\r\nthe brook to irrigate the water-meadow. That was all.\r\n\r\nFelix next wrote an anonymous letter to the Prince pointing out the\r\nvalue of the place. The Prince should seize it, and add to his power. He\r\nknew that the letter was delivered, but there was no sign. It had\r\nindeed, been read and laughed at. Why make further efforts when they\r\nalready had what they desired? One only, the deep and designing\r\nValentine, gave it serious thought in secret. It seemed to him that\r\nsomething might come of it, another day, when he was himself in\r\npower--if that should happen. But he, too, forgot it in a week. Some\r\nsecret effort was made to discover the writer, for the council were very\r\njealous of political opinion, but it soon ended. The idea, not being\r\nsupported by money or influence, fell into oblivion.\r\n\r\nFelix worked on, chipping out the canoe. The days passed, and the boat\r\nwas nearly finished. In a day or two now it would be launched, and soon\r\nafterwards he should commence his voyage. He should see Aurora once more\r\nonly. He should see her, but he should not say farewell; she would not\r\nknow that he was going till he had actually departed. As he thought thus\r\na dimness came before his eyes; his hand trembled, and he could not\r\nwork. He put down the chisel, and paused to steady himself.\r\n\r\nUpon the other side of the stream, somewhat lower down, a yellow\r\nwood-dog had been lapping the water to quench its thirst, watching the\r\nman the while. So long as Felix was intent upon his work, the wild\r\nanimal had no fear; the moment he looked up, the creature sprang back\r\ninto the underwood. A dove was cooing in the forest not far distant, but\r\nas he was about to resume work the cooing ceased. Then a wood-pigeon\r\nrose from the ashes with a loud clapping of wings. Felix listened. His\r\nhunter instinct told him that something was moving there. A rustling of\r\nthe bushes followed, and he took his spear which had been leant against\r\nthe adjacent tree. But, peering into the wood, in a moment he recognised\r\nOliver, who, having walked off his rage, was returning.\r\n\r\n\"I though it might have been a Bushman,\" said Felix, replacing his\r\nspear; \"only they are noiseless.\"\r\n\r\n\"Any of them might have cut me down,\" said Oliver; \"for I forgot my\r\nweapon. It is nearly noon; are you coming home to dinner?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; I must bring my tools.\"\r\n\r\nHe put them in the basket, and together they returned to the rope\r\nladder. As they passed the Pen by the river they caught sight of the\r\nBaron in the adjacent gardens, which were irrigated by his contrivances\r\nfrom the stream, and went towards him. A retainer held two horses, one\r\ngaily caparisoned, outside the garden; his master was talking with Sir\r\nConstans.\r\n\r\n\"It is Lord John,\" said Oliver. They approached slowly under the\r\nfruit-trees, not to intrude. Sir Constans was showing the courtier an\r\nearly cherry-tree, whose fruit was already set. The dry hot weather had\r\ncaused it to set even earlier than usual. A suit of black velvet, an\r\nextremely expensive and almost unprocurable material, brought the\r\ncourtier's pale features into relief. It was only by the very oldest\r\nfamilies that any velvet or satin or similar materials were still\r\npreserved; if these were in pecuniary difficulties they might sell some\r\npart of their store, but such things were not to be got for money in the\r\nordinary way.\r\n\r\nTwo small silver bars across his left shoulder showed that he was a\r\nlord-in-waiting. He was a handsome man, with clear-cut features,\r\nsomewhat rakish from late hours and dissipation, but not the less\r\ninteresting on that account. But his natural advantages were so over-run\r\nwith the affectation of the Court that you did not see the man at all,\r\nbeing absorbed by the studied gesture to display the jewelled ring, and\r\nthe peculiarly low tone of voice in which it was the fashion to speak.\r\n\r\nBeside the old warrior he looked a mere stripling. The Baron's arm was\r\nbare, his sleeve rolled up; and as he pointed to the tree above, the\r\nmuscles, as the limb moved, displayed themselves in knots, at which the\r\ncourtier himself could not refrain from glancing. Those mighty arms, had\r\nthey clasped him about the waist, could have crushed his bending ribs.\r\nThe heaviest blow that he could have struck upon that broad chest would\r\nhave produced no more effect than a hollow sound; it would not even have\r\nshaken that powerful frame.\r\n\r\nHe felt the steel blue eye, bright as the sky of midsummer, glance into\r\nhis very mind. The high forehead bare, for the Baron had his hat in his\r\nhand, mocked at him in its humility. The Baron bared his head in honour\r\nof the courtier's office and the Prince who had sent him. The beard,\r\nthough streaked with white, spoke little of age; it rather indicated an\r\nabundant, a luxuriant vitality.\r\n\r\nLord John was not at ease. He shifted from foot to foot, and\r\noccasionally puffed a large cigar of Devon tobacco. His errand was\r\nsimple enough. Some of the ladies at the Court had a fancy for fruit,\r\nespecially strawberries, but there were none in the market, nor to be\r\nobtained from the gardens about the town. It was recollected that Sir\r\nConstans was famous for his gardens, and the Prince despatched Lord John\r\nto Old House with a gracious message and request for a basket of\r\nstrawberries. Sir Constans was much pleased; but he regretted that the\r\nhot, dry weather had not permitted the fruit to come to any size or\r\nperfection. Still there were some.\r\n\r\nThe courtier accompanied him to the gardens, and saw the water-wheel\r\nwhich, turned by a horse, forced water from the stream into a small pond\r\nor elevated reservoir, from which it irrigated the ground. This supply\r\nof water had brought on the fruit, and Sir Constans was able to gather a\r\nsmall basket. He then looked round to see what other early product he\r\ncould send to the palace. There was no other fruit; the cherries, though\r\nset, were not ripe; but there was some asparagus, which had not yet been\r\nserved, said Lord John, at the Prince's table.\r\n\r\nSir Constans set men to hastily collect all that was ready, and while\r\nthis was done took the courtier over the gardens. Lord John felt no\r\ninterest whatever in such matters, but he could not choose but admire\r\nthe extraordinary fertility of the enclosure, and the variety of the\r\nproducts. There was everything; fruit of all kinds, herbs of every\r\nspecies, plots specially devoted to those possessing medicinal virtue.\r\nThis was only one part of the gardens; the orchards proper were farther\r\ndown, and the flowers nearer the house. Sir Constans had sent a man to\r\nthe flower-garden, who now returned with two fine bouquets, which were\r\npresented to Lord John: the one for the Princess, the Prince's sister;\r\nthe other for any lady to whom he might choose to present it.\r\n\r\nThe fruit had already been handed to the retainer who had charge of the\r\nhorses. Though interested, in spite of himself, Lord John, acknowledging\r\nthe flowers, turned to go with a sense of relief. This simplicity of\r\nmanners seemed discordant to him. He felt out of place, and in some way\r\nlowered in his own esteem, and yet he despised the rural retirement and\r\nbeauty about him.\r\n\r\nFelix and Oliver, a few yards distant, were waiting with rising tempers.\r\nThe spectacle of the Baron in his native might of physique, humbly\r\nstanding, hat in hand, before this Court messenger, discoursing on\r\ncherries, and offering flowers and fruit, filled them with anger and\r\ndisgust. The affected gesture and subdued voice of the courtier, on the\r\nother hand, roused an equal contempt.\r\n\r\nAs Lord John turned, he saw them. He did not quite guess their\r\nrelationship, but supposed they were cadets of the house, it being\r\ncustomary for those in any way connected to serve the head of the\r\nfamily. He noted the flag basket in Felix's hand, and naturally imagined\r\nthat he had been at work.\r\n\r\n\"You have been to-to plough, eh?\" he said, intending to be very gracious\r\nand condescending. \"Very healthy employment. The land requires some\r\nrain, does it not? Still I trust it will not rain till I am home, for my\r\nplume's sake,\" tossing his head. \"Allow me,\" and as he passed he offered\r\nOliver a couple of cigars. \"One each,\" he added; \"the best Devon.\"\r\n\r\nOliver took the cigars mechanically, holding them as if they had been\r\nvipers, at arm's length, till the courtier had left the garden, and the\r\nhedge interposed. Then he threw them into the water-carrier. The best\r\ntobacco, indeed the only real tobacco, came from the warm Devon land,\r\nbut little of it reached so far, on account of the distance, the\r\ndifficulties of intercourse, the rare occasions on which the merchant\r\nsucceeded in escaping the vexatious interference, the downright robbery\r\nof the way. Intercourse was often entirely closed by war.\r\n\r\nThese cigars, therefore, were worth their weight in silver, and such\r\ntobacco could be obtained only by those about the Court, as a matter of\r\nfavour, too, rather than by purchase. Lord John would, indeed, have\r\nstared aghast had he seen the rustic to whom he had given so valuable a\r\npresent cast them into a ditch. He rode towards the Maple Gate, excusing\r\nhis haste volubly to Sir Constans, who was on foot, and walked beside\r\nhim a little way, pressing him to take some refreshment.\r\n\r\nHis sons overtook the Baron as he walked towards home, and walked by his\r\nside in silence. Sir Constans was full of his fruit.\r\n\r\n\"The wall cherry,\" said he, \"will soon have a few ripe.\"\r\n\r\nOliver swore a deep but soundless oath in his chest. Sir Constans\r\ncontinued talking about his fruit and flowers, entirely oblivious of the\r\nsilent anger of the pair beside him. As they approached the house, the\r\nwarder blew his horn thrice for noon. It was also the signal for dinner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE FOREST TRACK\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the canoe was finished, Oliver came to help Felix launch it, and\r\nthey rolled it on logs down to the place where the stream formed a pool.\r\nBut when it was afloat, as Oliver had foretold, it did not swim upright\r\nin the water. It had not been shaped accurately, and one side was higher\r\nout of the water than the other.\r\n\r\nFelix was so disgusted at this failure that he would not listen to\r\nanything Oliver could suggest. He walked back to the spot where he had\r\nworked so many weeks, and sat down with his face turned from the pool.\r\nIt was not so much the actual circumstance which depressed him, as the\r\nlong train of untoward incidents which had preceded it for years past.\r\nThese seemed to have accumulated, till now this comparatively little\r\nannoyance was like the last straw.\r\n\r\nOliver followed him, and said that the defect could be remedied by\r\nplacing ballast on the more buoyant side of the canoe to bring it down\r\nto the level of the other; or, perhaps, if some more wood were cut away\r\non the heavier side, that it would cause it to rise. He offered to do\r\nthe work himself, but Felix, in his gloomy mood, would not answer him.\r\nOliver returned to the pool, and getting into the canoe, poled it up and\r\ndown the stream. It answered perfectly, and could be easily managed; the\r\ndefect was more apparent than real, for when a person sat in the canoe,\r\nhis weight seemed to bring it nearly level.\r\n\r\nIt was only when empty that it canted to one side. He came back again to\r\nFelix, and pointed this out to him. The attempt was useless; the boat\r\nmight answer the purpose perfectly well, but it was not the boat Felix\r\nhad intended it to be. It did not come up to his ideal.\r\n\r\nOliver was now somewhat annoyed at Felix's sullen silence, so he drew\r\nthe canoe partly on shore, to prevent it from floating away, and then\r\nleft him to himself.\r\n\r\nNothing more was said about it for a day or two. Felix did not go near\r\nthe spot where he had worked so hard and so long, but on the Saturday\r\nPhilip came home as usual, and, as there was now no secret about the\r\ncanoe, went down to look at it with Oliver. They pushed it off, and\r\nfloated two or three miles down the stream, hauling it on the shore past\r\nthe fallen fir tree, and then, with a cord, towed it back again. The\r\ncanoe, with the exception of the trifling deficiency alluded to, was a\r\ngood one, and thoroughly serviceable.\r\n\r\nThey endeavoured again to restore Felix's opinion of it, and an idea\r\noccurring to Philip, he said a capital plan would be to add an\r\noutrigger, and so balance it perfectly. But though usually quick to\r\nadopt ideas when they were good, in this case Felix was too much out of\r\nconceit with himself. He would listen to nothing. Still, he could not\r\nbanish it from his mind, though now ashamed to return to it after so\r\nobstinately refusing all suggestions. He wandered aimlessly about in the\r\nwoods, till one day he found himself in the path that led to Heron Bay.\r\n\r\nStrolling to the shore of the great Lake, he sat down and watched a\r\nvessel sailing afar off slowly before the east wind. The thought\r\npresently occurred to him, that the addition of an outrigger in the\r\nmanner Philip had mentioned would enable him to carry a sail. The canoe\r\ncould not otherwise support a sail (unless a very small one merely for\r\ngoing before the breeze), but with such a sail as the outrigger would\r\nbear, he could venture much farther away from land, his voyage might be\r\nmuch more extended, and his labour with the paddle lessened.\r\n\r\nThis filled him with fresh energy; he returned, and at once recommenced\r\nwork. Oliver, finding that he was again busy at it, came and insisted\r\nupon assisting. With his help, the work progressed rapidly. He used the\r\ntools so deftly as to accomplish more in an hour than Felix could in a\r\nday. The outrigger consisted of a beam of poplar, sharpened at both\r\nends, and held at some six or seven feet from the canoe by two strong\r\ncross-pieces.\r\n\r\nA mast, about the same height as the canoe was long, was then set up; it\r\nwas made from a young fir-tree. Another smaller fir supplied the yard,\r\nwhich extended fore and aft, nearly the length of the boat. The sail, of\r\ncoarse canvas, was not very high, but long, and rather broader at each\r\nend where the rope attached it to the prow and stern, or, rather, the\r\ntwo prows. Thus arranged, it was not so well suited for running straight\r\nbefore the wind, as for working into it, a feat never attempted by the\r\nships of the time.\r\n\r\nOliver was delighted with the appearance of the boat, so much so that\r\nnow and then he announced his intention of accompanying Felix on his\r\nvoyage. But after a visit to the town, and a glance at the Princess\r\nLucia, his resolution changed. Yet he wavered, one time openly\r\nreproaching himself for enduring such a life of inaction and ignominy,\r\nand at another deriding Felix and his visionary schemes. The canoe was\r\nnow completed; it was tried on the pool and found to float exactly as it\r\nshould. It had now to be conveyed to Heron Bay.\r\n\r\nThe original intention was to put it on a cart, but the rude carts used\r\non the estate could not very well carry it, and a sledge was\r\nsubstituted. Several times, during the journey through the forest, the\r\nsledge had to be halted while the underwood was cut away to permit of\r\nits passing; and once a slough had to be filled up with branches hewn\r\nfrom fir trees, and bundles of fern. These delays made it evening before\r\nthe shore of the creek was reached.\r\n\r\nIt was but a little inlet, scarce a bowshot wide at the entrance and\r\ncoming to a point inland. Here the canoe was left in charge of three\r\nserfs, who were ordered to build a hut and stay beside it. Some\r\nprovisions were sent next day on the backs of other serfs, and in the\r\nafternoon (it was Saturday) all three brothers arrived; the canoe was\r\nlaunched, and they started for a trial sail. With a south wind they ran\r\nto the eastward at a rapid pace, keeping close to the shore till within\r\na mile of White Horse.\r\n\r\nThere they brought to by steering the canoe dead against the wind; then\r\ntransferring the steering-paddle (a rather large one, made for the\r\npurpose) to the other end, and readjusting the sail, the outrigger being\r\nstill to leeward, they ran back at an equal speed. The canoe answered\r\nperfectly, and Felix was satisfied. He now despatched his tools and\r\nvarious weapons to the hut to be put on board. His own peculiar yew bow\r\nhe kept to the last at home; it and his chest bound with hide would go\r\nwith him on the last day.\r\n\r\nAlthough, in his original purpose, Felix had designed to go forth\r\nwithout anyone being aware of his intention, the circumstances which had\r\narisen, and the necessary employment of so many men, had let out the\r\nsecret to some degree. The removal of the tools and weapons, the\r\ncrossbow, darts, and spear, still more attracted attention. But little\r\nor nothing was said about it, though the Baron and Baroness could not\r\nhelp but observe these preparations. The Baron deliberately shut his\r\neyes and went about his gardening; he was now, too, busy with the first\r\nmowing. In his heart, perhaps, he felt that he had not done altogether\r\nright in so entirely retiring from the world.\r\n\r\nBy doing so he had condemned his children to loneliness, and to be\r\nregarded with contempt. Too late now, he could only obstinately persist\r\nin his course. The Baroness, inured for so many, many years to\r\ndisappointment, had contracted her view of life till it scarcely\r\nextended beyond mere physical comfort. Nor could she realize the idea of\r\nFelix's approaching departure; when he was actually gone, it would,\r\nperhaps, come home to her.\r\n\r\nAll was now ready, and Felix was only waiting for the Feast of St. James\r\nto pay a last visit to Aurora at Thyma Castle. The morning before the\r\nday of the Feast, Felix and Oliver set out together. They had not lived\r\naltogether in harmony, but now, at this approaching change, Oliver felt\r\nthat he must bear Felix company. Oliver rode his beautiful Night, he\r\nwore his plumed hat and precious sword, and carried his horseman's\r\nlance. Felix rode a smaller horse, useful, but far from handsome. He\r\ncarried his yew bow and hunting knife.\r\n\r\nThyma Castle was situated fifteen miles to the south; it was the last\r\noutpost of civilization; beyond it there was nothing but forest, and the\r\nwild open plains, the home of the gipsies. This circumstance of position\r\nhad given Baron Thyma, in times past, a certain importance more than was\r\ndue to the size of his estate or the number of his retainers. During an\r\ninvasion of the gipsies, his castle bore the brunt of the war, and its\r\ngallant defence, indeed, broke their onward progress. So many fell in\r\nendeavouring to take it, that the rest were disheartened, and only\r\nscattered bands penetrated beyond.\r\n\r\nFor this service the Baron received the grant of various privileges; he\r\nwas looked on as a pillar of the State, and was welcome at the court.\r\nBut it proved an injury to him in the end. His honours, and the high\r\nsociety they led him into, were too great for the comparative smallness\r\nof his income. Rich in flocks and herds, he had but little coin.\r\nHigh-spirited, and rather fond of display, he could not hold back; he\r\nlaunched forth, with the usual result of impoverishment, mortgage, and\r\ndebt.\r\n\r\nHe had hoped to obtain the command of an army in the wars that broke out\r\nfrom time to time; it was, indeed, universally admitted that he was in\r\nevery respect qualified for such a post. The courtiers and others,\r\nhowever, jealous, as is ever the case, of ability and real talent,\r\ndebarred him by their intrigues from attaining his object. Pride\r\nprevented him from acquiescing in this defeat; he strove by display and\r\nextravagance to keep himself well to the front, flaunting himself before\r\nthe eyes of all. This course could not last long; he was obliged to\r\nretire to his estate, which narrowly escaped forfeiture to his\r\ncreditors.\r\n\r\nSo ignominious an end after such worthy service was, however, prevented\r\nby the personal interference of the old Prince, who, from his private\r\nresources, paid off the most pressing creditors. To the last, the old\r\nPrince received him as a friend, and listened to his counsel. Thyma was\r\never in hopes that some change in the balance of parties would give him\r\nhis opportunity. When the young Prince succeeded, he was clever enough\r\nto see that the presence of such men about his Court gave it a\r\nstability, and he, too, invited Thyma to tender his advice. The Baron's\r\nhopes now rose higher than ever, but again he was disappointed.\r\n\r\nThe new Prince, himself incapable, disliked and distrusted talent. The\r\nyears passed, and the Baron obtained no appointment. Still he strained\r\nhis resources to the utmost to visit the Court as often as possible;\r\nstill he believed that sooner or later a turn of the wheel would elevate\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThere had existed between the houses of Thyma and Aquila the bond of\r\nhearth-friendship; the gauntlets, hoofs, and rings were preserved by\r\nboth, and the usual presents passed thrice a year, at midsummer,\r\nChristmas, and Lady-day. Not much personal intercourse had taken place,\r\nhowever, for some years, until Felix was attracted by the beauty of the\r\nLady Aurora. Proud, showy, and pushing, Thyma could not understand the\r\nfeelings which led his hearth-friend to retire from the arena and busy\r\nhimself with cherries and water-wheels. On the other hand, Constans\r\nrather looked with quiet derision on the ostentation of the other. Thus\r\nthere was a certain distance, as it were, between them.\r\n\r\nBaron Thyma could not, of course, be ignorant of the attachment between\r\nhis daughter and Felix; yet as much as possible he ignored it. He never\r\nreferred to Felix; if his name was incidentally mentioned, he remained\r\nsilent. The truth was, he looked higher for Lady Aurora. He could not in\r\ncourtesy discourage even in the faintest manner the visits of his\r\nfriend's son; the knightly laws of honour would have forbidden so mean a\r\ncourse. Nor would his conscience permit him to do so, remembering the\r\nold days when he and the Baron were glad companions together, and how\r\nthe Baron Aquila was the first to lead troops to his assistance in the\r\ngipsy war. Still, he tacitly disapproved; he did not encourage.\r\n\r\nFelix felt that he was not altogether welcome; he recognised the sense\r\nof restraint that prevailed when he was present. It deeply hurt his\r\npride, and nothing but his love for Aurora could have enabled him to\r\nbear up against it. The galling part of it was that he could not in his\r\nsecret heart condemn the father for evidently desiring a better alliance\r\nfor his child. This was the strongest of the motives that had determined\r\nhim to seek the unknown.\r\n\r\nIf anything, the Baron would have preferred Oliver as a suitor for his\r\ndaughter; he sympathized with Oliver's fiery spirit, and admired his\r\nfeats of strength and dexterity with sword and spear. He had always\r\nwelcomed Oliver heartily, and paid him every attention. This, to do\r\nOliver justice, was one reason why he determined to accompany his\r\nbrother, thinking that if he was there he could occupy attention, and\r\nthus enable Felix to have more opportunity to speak with Aurora.\r\n\r\nThe two rode forth from the courtyard early in the morning, and passing\r\nthrough the whole length of the enclosure within the stockade, issued at\r\nthe South Barrier and almost immediately entered the forest. They rather\r\nchecked their horses' haste, fresh as the animals were from the stable,\r\nbut could not quite control their spirits, for the walk of a horse is\r\neven half as fast again while he is full of vigour. The turn of the\r\ntrack soon shut out the stockade; they were alone in the woods.\r\n\r\nLong since, early as they were, the sun had dried the dew, for his beams\r\nwarm the atmosphere quickly as the spring advances towards summer. But\r\nit was still fresh and sweet among the trees, and even Felix, though\r\nbound on so gloomy an errand, could not choose but feel the joyous\r\ninfluence of the morning. Oliver sang aloud in his rich deep voice, and\r\nthe thud, thud of the horses' hoofs kept time to the ballad.\r\n\r\nThe thrushes flew but a little way back from the path as they passed,\r\nand began to sing again directly they were by. The whistling of\r\nblackbirds came from afar where there were open glades or a running\r\nstream; the notes of the cuckoo became fainter and fainter as they\r\nadvanced farther from the stockade, for the cuckoo likes the woodlands\r\nthat immediately border on cultivation. For some miles the track was\r\nbroad, passing through thickets of thorn and low hawthorn-trees with\r\nimmense masses of tangled underwood between, brambles and woodbine\r\ntwisted and matted together, impervious above but hollow beneath; under\r\nthese they could hear the bush-hens running to and fro and scratching at\r\nthe dead leaves which strewed the ground. Sounds of clucking deeper in\r\nbetrayed the situation of their nests.\r\n\r\nRushes, and the dead sedges of last year, up through which the green\r\nfresh leaves were thrusting themselves, in some places stood beside the\r\nway, fringing the thorns where the hollow ground often held the water\r\nfrom rainstorms. Out from these bushes a rabbit occasionally started and\r\nbounded across to the other side. Here, where there were so few trees,\r\nand the forest chiefly consisted of bush, they could see some distance\r\non either hand, and also a wide breadth of the sky. After a time the\r\nthorn bushes were succeeded by ash wood, where the trees stood closer to\r\nthe path, contracting the view; it was moister here, the hoofs cut into\r\nthe grass, which was coarse and rank. The trees growing so close\r\ntogether destroyed themselves, their lower branches rubbed together and\r\nwere killed, so that in many spots the riders could see a long way\r\nbetween the trunks.\r\n\r\nEvery time the wind blew they could hear a distant cracking of branches\r\nas the dead boughs, broken by the swaying of the trees, fell off and\r\ncame down. Had any one attempted to walk into the forest there they\r\nwould have sunk above the ankle in soft decaying wood, hidden from sight\r\nby thick vegetation. Wood-pigeons rose every minute from these ash-trees\r\nwith a loud clatter of wings; their calls resounded continually, now\r\ndeep in the forest, and now close at hand. It was evident that a large\r\nflock of them had their nesting-place here, and indeed their nests of\r\ntwigs could be frequently seen from the path. There seemed no other\r\nbirds.\r\n\r\nAgain the forest changed, and the track, passing on higher ground,\r\nentered among firs. These, too, had killed each other by growing so\r\nthickly; the lower branches of many were dead, and there was nothing but\r\na little green at the tops, while in many places there was an open space\r\nwhere they had decayed away altogether. Brambles covered the ground in\r\nthese open places, brambles and furze now bright with golden blossom.\r\nThe jays screeched loudly, startled as the riders passed under them, and\r\nfluttered away; rabbits, which they saw again here, dived into their\r\nburrows. Between the first the track was very narrow, and they could not\r\nconveniently ride side by side; Oliver took the lead, and Felix\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE FOREST TRACK CONTINUED\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce as they trotted by a pheasant rose screaming from the furze and\r\nflew before them down the track. Just afterwards Felix, who had been\r\npreviously looking very carefully into the firs upon his right hand,\r\nsuddenly stopped, and Oliver, finding this, pulled up as quickly as he\r\ncould, thinking that Felix wished to tighten his girth.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" he asked, turning round in his saddle.\r\n\r\n\"Hush!\" said Felix, dismounting; his horse, trained to hunting, stood\r\nperfectly still, and would have remained within a few yards of the spot\r\nby the hour together. Oliver reined back, seeing Felix about to bend and\r\nstring his bow.\r\n\r\n\"Bushmen,\" whispered Felix, as he, having fitted the loop to the horn\r\nnotch, drew forth an arrow from his girdle, where he carried two or\r\nthree more ready to hand than in the quiver on his shoulder. \"I thought\r\nI saw signs of them some time since, and now I am nearly sure. Stay here\r\na moment.\"\r\n\r\nHe stepped aside from the track in among the firs, which just there were\r\nfar apart, and went to a willow bush standing by some furze. He had\r\nnoticed that one small branch on the outer part of the bush was snapped\r\noff, though green, and only hung by the bark. The wood cattle, had they\r\nbrowsed upon it, would have nibbled the tenderest leaves at the end of\r\nthe bough; nor did they usually touch willow, for the shoots are bitter\r\nand astringent. Nor would the deer touch it in the spring, when they had\r\nso wide a choice of food.\r\n\r\nNothing could have broken the branch in that manner unless it was the\r\nhand of a man, or a blow with a heavy stick wielded by a human hand. On\r\ncoming to the bush he saw that the fracture was very recent, for the\r\nbough was perfectly green; it had not turned brown, and the bark was\r\nstill soft with sap. It had not been cut with a knife or any sharp\r\ninstrument; it had been broken by rude violence, and not divided. The\r\nnext thing to catch his eye was the appearance of a larger branch\r\nfarther inside the bush.\r\n\r\nThis was not broken, but a part of the bark was abraded, and even torn\r\nup from the wood as if by the impact of some hard substance, as a stone\r\nthrown with great force. He examined the ground, but there was no stone\r\nvisible, and on again looking at the bark he concluded that it had not\r\nbeen done with a stone at all, because the abraded portion was not cut.\r\nThe blow had been delivered by something without edges or projections.\r\nHe had now no longer any doubt that the lesser branch outside had been\r\nbroken, and the large inside branch bruised, by the passage of a\r\nBushman's throw-club.\r\n\r\nThese, their only missile weapons, are usually made of crab-tree, and\r\nconsist of a very thin short handle, with a large, heavy, and smooth\r\nknob. With these they can bring down small game, as rabbits or hares, or\r\na fawn (even breaking the legs of deer), or the large birds, as the\r\nwood-turkeys. Stealing up noiselessly within ten yards, the Bushman\r\nthrows his club with great force, and rarely misses his aim. If not\r\nkilled at once, the game is certain to be stunned, and is much more\r\neasily secured than if wounded with an arrow, for with an arrow in its\r\nwing a large bird will flutter along the ground, and perhaps creep into\r\nsedges or under impenetrable bushes.\r\n\r\nDeprived of motion by the blow of the club, it can, on the other hand,\r\nbe picked up without trouble and without the aid of a dog, and if not\r\ndead is despatched by a twist of the Bushman's fingers or a thrust from\r\nhis spud. The spud is at once his dagger, his knife and fork, his\r\nchisel, his grub-axe, and his gouge. It is a piece of iron (rarely or\r\nnever of steel, for he does not know how to harden it) about ten inches\r\nlong, an inch and a half wide at the top or broadest end, where it is\r\nshaped and sharpened like a chisel, only with the edge not straight but\r\nsloping, and from thence tapering to a point at the other, the pointed\r\npart being four-sided, like a nail.\r\n\r\nIt has, indeed, been supposed that the original spud was formed from a\r\nlarge wrought-iron nail, such as the ancients used, sharpened on a stone\r\nat one end, and beaten out flat at the other. This instrument has a\r\nhandle in the middle, half-way between the chisel end and the point. The\r\nhandle is of horn or bone (the spud being put through the hollow of the\r\nbone), smoothed to fit the hand. With the chisel end he cuts up his game\r\nand his food; the edge, being sloping, is drawn across the meat and\r\ndivides it. With this end, too, he fashions his club and his traps, and\r\ndigs up the roots he uses. The other end he runs into his meat as a\r\nfork, or thrusts it into the neck of his game to kill it and let out the\r\nblood, or with it stabs a sleeping enemy.\r\n\r\nThe stab delivered by the Bushman can always be distinguished, because\r\nthe wound is invariably square, and thus a clue only too certain has\r\noften been afforded to the assassin of many an unfortunate hunter.\r\nWhatever the Bushman in this case had hurled his club at, the club had\r\ngone into the willow bush, snapping the light branch and leaving its\r\nmark upon the bark of the larger. A moment's reflection convinced Felix\r\nthat the Bushman had been in chase of a pheasant. Only a few moments\r\npreviously a pheasant had flown before them down the track, and where\r\nthere was one pheasant there were generally several more in the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThe Bushmen were known to be peculiarly fond of the pheasant, pursuing\r\nthem all the year round without reference to the breeding season, and so\r\ncontinuously, that it was believed they caused these birds to be much\r\nless numerous, notwithstanding the vast extent of the forests, than they\r\nwould otherwise have been. From the fresh appearance of the snapped\r\nbough, the Bushman must have passed but a few hours previously, probably\r\nat the dawn, and was very likely concealed at that moment near at hand\r\nin the forest, perhaps within a hundred yards.\r\n\r\nFelix looked carefully round, but could see nothing; there were the\r\ntrees, not one of them large enough to hide a man behind it, the furze\r\nbranches were small and scattered, and there was not sufficient fern to\r\nconceal anything. The keenest glance could discern nothing more. There\r\nwere no footmarks on the ground, indeed, the dry, dead leaves and fir\r\nneedles could hardly have received any impression, and up in the firs\r\nthe branches were thin, and the sky could be seen through them. Whether\r\nthe Bushman was lying in some slight depression of the ground, or\r\nwhether he had covered himself with dead leaves and fir needles, or\r\nwhether he had gone on and was miles away, there was nothing to show.\r\nBut of the fact that he had been there Felix was perfectly certain.\r\n\r\nHe returned towards Oliver, thoughtful and not without some anxiety, for\r\nhe did not like the idea (though there was really little or no danger)\r\nof these human wild beasts being so near Aurora, while he should so soon\r\nbe far away. Thus occupied he did not heed his steps, and suddenly felt\r\nsomething soft under his feet, which struggled. Instantaneously he\r\nsprang as far as he could, shuddering, for he had crushed an adder, and\r\nbut just escaped, by his involuntary and mechanical leap, from its\r\nvenom.\r\n\r\nIn the warm sunshine the viper, in its gravid state, had not cared to\r\nmove as usual on hearing his approach; he had stepped full upon it. He\r\nhastened from the spot, and rejoined Oliver in a somewhat shaken state\r\nof mind. Common as such an incident was in the woods, where sandy soil\r\nwarned the hunter to be careful, it seemed ominous that particular\r\nmorning, and, joined with the discovery of Bushman traces, quite\r\ndestroyed his sense of the beauty of the day.\r\n\r\nOn hearing the condition of the willow boughs Oliver agreed as to the\r\ncause, and said that they must remember to warn the Baron's shepherds\r\nthat the Bushmen, who had not been seen for some time, were about. Soon\r\nafterwards they emerged from the sombre firs and crossed a wide and\r\nsloping ground, almost bare of trees, where a forest fire last year had\r\nswept away the underwood. A verdant growth of grass was now springing\r\nup. Here they could canter side by side. The sunshine poured down, and\r\nbirds were singing joyously. But they soon passed it, and checked their\r\nspeed on entering the trees again.\r\n\r\nTall beeches, with round smooth trunks, stood thick and close upon the\r\ndry and rising ground; their boughs met overhead, forming a green\r\ncontinuous arch for miles. The space between was filled with brake fern,\r\nnow fast growing up, and the track itself was green with moss. As they\r\ncame into this beautiful place a red stag, startled from his browsing,\r\nbounded down the track, his swift leaps carried him away like the wind;\r\nin another moment he left the path and sprang among the fern, and was\r\nseen only in glimpses as he passed between the beeches. Squirrels ran up\r\nthe trunks as they approached; they could see many on the ground in\r\namong the trees, and passed under others on the branches high above\r\nthem. Woodpeckers flashed across the avenue.\r\n\r\nOnce Oliver pointed out the long, lean flank of a grey pig, or fern-hog,\r\nas the animal rushed away among the brake. There were several glades,\r\nfrom one of which they startled a few deer, whose tails only were seen\r\nas they bounded into the underwood, but after the glades came the\r\nbeeches again. Beeches always form the most beautiful forest, beeches\r\nand oak; and though nearing the end of their journey, they regretted\r\nwhen they emerged from these trees and saw the castle before them.\r\n\r\nThe ground suddenly sloped down into a valley, beyond which rose the\r\nDowns; the castle stood on a green isolated low hill, about half-way\r\nacross the vale. To the left a river wound past; to the right the beech\r\nforest extended as far as the eye could see. The slope at their feet had\r\nbeen cleared of all but a few hawthorn bushes. It was not enclosed, but\r\na neatherd was there with his cattle half a mile away, sitting himself\r\nat the foot of a beech, while the cattle grazed below him.\r\n\r\nDown in the valley the stockade began; it was not wide but long. The\r\nenclosure extended on the left to the bank of the river, and two fields\r\non the other side of it. On the right it reached a mile and a half or\r\nnearly, the whole of which was overlooked from the spot where they had\r\npassed. Within the enclosures the corn crops were green and flourishing;\r\nhorses and cattle, ricks and various buildings, were scattered about it.\r\nThe town or cottages of the serfs were on the bank of the river\r\nimmediately beyond the castle. On the Downs, which rose a mile or more\r\non the other side of the castle, sheep were feeding; part of the ridge\r\nwas wooded and part open. Thus the cultivated and enclosed valley was\r\neverywhere shut in with woods and hills.\r\n\r\nThe isolated round hill on which the castle stood was itself enclosed\r\nwith a second stockade; the edge of the brow above that again was\r\ndefended by a stout high wall of flints and mortar, crenellated at the\r\ntop. There were no towers or bastions. An old and ivy-grown building\r\nstood inside the wall; it dated from the time of the ancients; it had\r\nseveral gables, and was roofed with tiles. This was the dwelling-house.\r\nThe gardens were situated on the slope between the wall and the inner\r\nstockade. Peaceful as the scene appeared, it had been the site of\r\nfurious fighting not many years ago. The Downs trended to the south,\r\nwhere the Romany and the Zingari resided, and a keen watch was kept both\r\nfrom the wall and from the hills beyond.\r\n\r\nThey now rode slowly down the slope, and in a few minutes reached the\r\nbarrier or gateway in the outer stockade. They had been observed, and\r\nthe guard called by the warden, but as they approached were recognised,\r\nand the gate swang open before them. Walking their horses they crossed\r\nto the hill, and were as easily admitted to the second enclosure. At the\r\ngate of the wall they dismounted, and waited while the warden carried\r\nthe intelligence of their arrival to the family. A moment later, and the\r\nBaron's son advanced from the porch, and from the open window the\r\nBaroness and Aurora beckoned to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHYMA CASTLE\r\n\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards the hollow sound of the warden's horn, from the watch\r\nover the gate of the wall, proclaimed the hour of noon, and they all\r\nassembled for dinner in the banqueting chamber. The apartment was on the\r\nground floor, and separated from the larger hall only by an internal\r\nwall. The house, erected in the time of the ancients, was not designed\r\nfor our present style of life; it possessed, indeed, many comforts and\r\nconveniences which are scarcely now to be found in the finest palaces,\r\nbut it lacked the breadth of construction which our architects have now\r\nin view.\r\n\r\nIn the front there were originally only two rooms, extensive for those\r\nold days, but not sufficiently so for ours. One of these had therefore\r\nbeen enlarged, by throwing into it a back room and part of the entrance,\r\nand even then it was not long enough for the Baron's retainers, and at\r\nfeast-time a wooden shed was built opposite, and up to the window, to\r\ncontinue, as it were, the apartment out of doors. Workmen were busy\r\nputting up this shed when they arrived.\r\n\r\nThe second apartment retained its ancient form, and was used as the\r\ndining-room on ordinary days. It was lighted by a large window, now\r\nthrown wide open that the sweet spring air might enter, which window was\r\nthe pride of the Baroness, for it contained more true glass than any\r\nwindow in the palace of the Prince. The glass made now is not\r\ntransparent, but merely translucent; it indeed admits light after a\r\nfashion, but it is thick and cannot be seen through. These panes were\r\nalmost all (the central casement wholly) of ancient glass, preserved\r\nwith the greatest care through the long years past.\r\n\r\nThree tables were arranged in an open square; the Baron and Baroness's\r\nchairs of oak faced the window, the guests sat at the other tables\r\nsideways to them, the servants moved on the outer side, and thus placed\r\nthe food before them without pushing against or incommoding them. A\r\nfourth table was placed in a corner between the fireplace and the\r\nwindow. At it sat the old nurse, the housekeeper (frequently arising to\r\norder the servants), and the Baron's henchman, who had taught him to\r\nride, but now, grey and aged, could not mount himself without\r\nassistance, and had long ceased from active service.\r\n\r\nAlready eight or nine guests had arrived besides Felix and Oliver. Some\r\nhad ridden a great distance to be present at the House Day. They were\r\nall nobles, richly dressed; one or two of the eldest were wealthy and\r\npowerful men, and the youngest was the son and heir of the Earl of\r\nEssiton, who was then the favourite at Court. Each had come with his\r\npersonal attendants; the young Lord Durand brought with him twenty-five\r\nretainers, and six gentlemen friends, all of whom were lodged in the\r\ntown, the gentlemen taking their meals at the castle at the same time as\r\nthe Baron, but, owing to lack of room, in another apartment by\r\nthemselves. Durand was placed, or rather, quietly helped himself to a\r\nseat, next to the Lady Aurora, and of all the men there present,\r\ncertainly there was none more gallant and noble than he.\r\n\r\nHis dark eyes, his curling hair short but brought in a thick curl over\r\nhis forehead, his lips well shaped, his chin round and somewhat\r\nprominent, the slight moustache (no other hair on the face), formed the\r\nvery ideal of what many women look for in a man. But it was his bright,\r\nlively conversation, the way in which his slightly swarthy complexion\r\nflushed with animation, the impudent assurance and yet generous warmth\r\nof his manner, and, indeed, of his feelings, which had given him the\r\nmerited reputation of being the very flower of the nobles.\r\n\r\nWith such a reputation, backed with the great wealth and power of his\r\nfather, gentlemen competed with each other to swell his train; he could\r\nnot, indeed, entertain all that came, and was often besieged with almost\r\nas large a crowd as the Prince himself. He took as his right the chair\r\nnext to Aurora, to whom, indeed, he had been paying unremitting\r\nattention all the morning. She was laughing heartily as she sat down, at\r\nsome sally of his upon a beauty at the Court.\r\n\r\nThe elder men were placed highest up the tables, and nearest the host,\r\nbut to the astonishment of all, and not the least of himself, Oliver was\r\ninvited by the Baron to sit by his side. Oliver could not understand\r\nthis special mark of favour; the others, though far too proud for a\r\nmoment to resent what they might have deemed a slight upon them, at once\r\nbegan to search their minds for a reason. They knew the Baron as an old\r\nintriguer; they attached a meaning, whether intended or not, to his\r\nsmallest action.\r\n\r\nFelix, crowded out, as it were, and unnoticed, was forced to take his\r\nseat at the end of the table nearest that set apart in the corner for\r\nthe aged and honoured servitors of the family. Only a few feet\r\nintervened between him and ancient henchmen; and he could not but\r\noverhear their talk among themselves, whispered as it was. He had merely\r\nshaken hands with Aurora; the crowd in the drawing-room and the marked\r\nattentions of Durand had prevented the exchange of a single word between\r\nthem. As usual, the sense of neglect and injury over which he had so\r\nlong brooded with little or no real cause (considering, of course, his\r\nposition, and that the world can only see our coats and not our hearts),\r\nunder these entirely accidental circumstances rose up again within him,\r\nand blinded him to the actual state of things.\r\n\r\nHis seat, the lowest, and the nearest to the servitors, was in itself a\r\nmark of the low estimation in which he was held. The Lord Durand had\r\nbeen placed next to Aurora, as a direct encouragement to him, and a\r\ndirect hint to himself not to presume. Doubtless, Durand had been at the\r\ncastle many times, not improbably already been accepted by the Baron,\r\nand not altogether refused by Aurora. As a fact, though delighted with\r\nher beauty and conversation, Durand's presence was entirely due to the\r\nwill of his father, the Earl, who wished to maintain friendly relations\r\nwith Baron Thyma, and even then he would not have come had not the\r\nlovely weather invited him to ride into the forest.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, so far true, that though his presence was accidental,\r\nyet he was fast becoming fascinated by one who, girl though she was, was\r\nstronger in mind than he. Now Aurora, knowing that he father's eye was\r\non her, dared not look towards Felix, lest by an open and pronounced\r\nconduct she should be the cause of his being informed that his presence\r\nwas not desirable. She knew that the Baron only needed a pretext to\r\ninterfere, and was anxious to avoid offering him a chance.\r\n\r\nFelix, seeing her glance bent downwards or towards her companion, and\r\nnever all the time turned to him, not unnaturally, but too hastily,\r\nconcluded that she had been dazzled by Durand and the possibility of an\r\nalliance with his powerful family. He was discarded, worthless, and of\r\nno account; he had nothing but his sword; nay, he had not a sword, he\r\nwas only an archer, a footman. Angry, jealous, and burning with inward\r\nannoyance, despising himself since all others despised him, scarce able\r\nto remain at the table, Felix was almost beside himself, and did not\r\nanswer nor heed the remarks of the gentlemen sitting by him, who put him\r\ndown as an ill-bred churl.\r\n\r\nFor the form's sake, indeed, he put his lips to the double-handled cup\r\nof fine ale, which continually circulated round the table, and was never\r\nallowed to be put down; one servant had nothing else to do but to see\r\nthat its progress never stopped. But he drank nothing, and ate nothing;\r\nhe could not swallow. How visionary, how weak and feeble now seemed the\r\nwild scheme of the canoe and his proposed voyage! Even should it\r\nsucceed, years must elapse before he could accomplish anything\r\nsubstantial; while here were men who really had what he could only think\r\nof or imagine.\r\n\r\nThe silver chain or sword-belt of Durand (the sword and the dagger were\r\nnot worn at the banquet, nor in the house, they were received by the\r\nmarshal, and deposited in his care, a precaution against quarrelling),\r\nsolid silver links passing over his shoulder, were real actual things.\r\nAll the magnificence that he could call up by the exercise of his\r\nimagination, was but imagination; a dream no more to be seen by others\r\nthan the air itself.\r\n\r\nThe dinner went on, and the talk became more noisy. The trout, the\r\nchicken, the thyme lamb (trapped on the hills by the shepherds), the\r\nplover eggs, the sirloin, the pastry (the Baroness superintended the\r\nmaking of it herself), all the profusion of the table, rather set him\r\nagainst food than tempted him. Nor could he drink the tiny drop, as it\r\nwere, of ancient brandy, sent round to each guest at the conclusion,\r\nprecious as liquid gold, for it had been handed down from the ancients,\r\nand when once the cask was empty it could not be re-filled.\r\n\r\nThe dessert, the strawberries, the nuts and walnuts, carefully preserved\r\nwith a little salt, and shaken in the basket from time to time that they\r\nmight not become mouldy, the apples, the honey in the comb with slices\r\nof white bread, nothing pleased him. Nor did he drink, otherwise than\r\nthe sip demanded by courtesy, of the thin wine of Gloucester, costly as\r\nit was, grown in the vineyard there, and shipped across the Lake, and\r\nrendered still more expensive by risk of pirates. This was poured into\r\nflagons of maple wood, which, like the earthenware cup of ale, were\r\nnever allowed to touch the board till the dinner was over.\r\n\r\nWearily the time went on; Felix glanced more and more often at the sky\r\nseen through the casement, eagerly desiring to escape, and at least to\r\nbe alone. At last (how long it seemed!) the Baron rose, and immediately\r\nthe rest did the same, and they drank the health of the Prince. Then a\r\nservitor brought in a pile of cigars upon a carved wooden tray, like a\r\nlarge platter, but with a rim. \"These,\" said the Baron, again rising\r\n(the signal to all to cease conversing and to listen), \"are a present\r\nfrom my gracious and noble friend the Earl of Essiton\" (he looked\r\ntowards Durand), \"not less kindly carried by Lord Durand. I could have\r\nprovided only our own coarse tobacco; but these are the best Devon.\"\r\n\r\nThe ladies now left the table, Aurora escorted by Durand, the Baroness\r\nby Oliver. Oliver, indeed, was in the highest spirits; he had eaten\r\nheartily of all; especially the sweet thyme lamb, and drunk as freely.\r\nHe was in his element, his laugh the loudest, his talk the liveliest.\r\nDirectly Durand returned (he had gone even a part of the way upstairs\r\ntowards the drawing-room with Aurora, a thing a little against\r\netiquette) he took his chair, formality being now at an end, and placed\r\nit by Oliver. They seemed to become friends at once by sympathy of mind\r\nand taste.\r\n\r\nRound them the rest gradually grouped themselves, so that presently\r\nFelix, who did not move, found himself sitting alone at the extreme end\r\nof the table; quite apart, for the old retainers, who dined at the\r\nseparate table, had quitted the apartment when the wine was brought in.\r\nFreed from the restraint of the ladies, the talk now became extremely\r\nnoisy, the blue smoke from the long cigars filled the great apartment;\r\none only remained untouched, that placed before Felix. Suddenly it\r\nstruck him that thus sitting alone and apart, he should attract\r\nattention; he, therefore, drew his chair to the verge of the group, but\r\nremained silent, and as far off as ever. Presently the arrival of five\r\nmore guests caused a stir and confusion, in the midst of which he\r\nescaped into the open air.\r\n\r\nHe wandered towards the gate of the wall, passing the wooden shed where\r\nthe clink of hammers resounded, glanced at the sundial, which showed the\r\nhour of three (three weary hours had they feasted), and went out into\r\nthe gardens. Still going on, he descended the slope, and not much\r\nheeding whither he was going, took the road that led into town. It\r\nconsisted of some hundred or more houses, built of wood and thatched,\r\nplaced without plan or arrangement on the bank of the stream. Only one\r\nlong street ran through it, the rest were mere by-ways.\r\n\r\nAll these were inhabited by the Baron's retainers, but the number and\r\napparently small extent of the houses did not afford correct data for\r\nthe actual amount of the population. In these days the people (as is\r\nwell known) find much difficulty in marrying; it seems only possible for\r\na certain proportion to marry, and hence there are always a great number\r\nof young or single men out of all ratio to the houses. At the sound of\r\nthe bugle the Baron could reckon on at least three hundred men flocking\r\nwithout a minute's delay to man the wall; in an hour more would arrive\r\nfrom the outer places, and by nightfall, if the summons went forth in\r\nthe morning, his shepherds and swineherds would arrive, and these\r\ntogether would add some hundred and fifty to the garrison.\r\n\r\nNext must be reckoned the armed servants of the house, the Baron's\r\npersonal attendants, the gentlemen who formed his train, his sons and\r\nthe male relations of the family; these certainly were not less than\r\nfifty. Altogether over five hundred men, well armed and accustomed to\r\nthe use of their weapons, would range themselves beneath his banner. Two\r\nof the buildings in he town were of brick (the material carried hither,\r\nfor there was no clay or stone thereabouts); they were not far apart.\r\nThe one was the Toll House, where all merchants or traders paid the\r\ncharges in corn or kind due to the Baron; the other was the Court House,\r\nwhere he sat to administer justice and decide causes, or to send the\r\ncriminal to the gibbet.\r\n\r\nThese alone of the buildings were of any age, for the wooden houses were\r\nextremely subject to destruction by fire, and twice in the Baron's time\r\nhalf the town had been laid in ashes, only to rise again in a few weeks.\r\nTimber was so abundant and so ready of access, it seemed a loss of\r\nlabour to fetch stone or brick, or to use the flints of the hills. About\r\nthe doors of the two inns there were gathered groups of people; among\r\nthem the liveries of the nobles visiting the castle were conspicuous;\r\nthe place was full of them, the stables were filled, and their horses\r\nwere picketed under the trees and even in the street.\r\n\r\nEvery minute the numbers increased as others arrived; men, too (who had\r\nobtained permission of their lords), came in on foot, ten or twelve\r\ntravelling together for mutual protection, for the feuds of their\r\nmasters exposed them to frequent attack. All (except the nobles) were\r\ndisarmed at the barrier by the warden and guard, that peace might be\r\npreserved in the enclosure. The folk at the moment he passed were\r\nwatching the descent of three covered waggons from the forest track, in\r\nwhich were travelling the ladies of as many noble families.\r\n\r\nSome, indeed, of the youngest and boldest ride on horseback, but the\r\nladies chiefly move in these waggons, which are fitted up with\r\nconsiderable comfort, and are necessary to sleep in when the camp is\r\nformed by the wayside at night. None noticed him as he went by, except a\r\ngroup of three cottage girls, and a serving-woman, an attendant of a\r\nlady visitor at the castle. He heard them allude to him; he quickened\r\nhis pace, but heard one say, \"He's nobody; he hasn't even got a horse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes he is,\" replied the serving-woman; \"he's Oliver's brother; and I\r\ncan tell you my lord Oliver is somebody; the Princess Lucia--\" and she\r\nmade the motion of kissing with her lips. Felix, ashamed and annoyed to\r\nthe last degree, stepped rapidly from the spot. The serving-woman,\r\nhowever, was right in a measure; the real or supposed favour shown\r\nOliver by the Prince's sister, the Duchess of Deverell, had begun to be\r\nbruited abroad, and this was the secret reason why the Baron had shown\r\nOliver so much and so marked an attention, even more than he had paid to\r\nLord Durand.\r\n\r\nFull well he knew the extraordinary influence possessed by ladies of\r\nrank and position. From what we can learn out of the scanty records of\r\nthe past, it was so even in the days of the ancients; it is a\r\nhundredfold more so in these times, when, although every noble must of\r\nnecessity be taught to read and write, as a matter of fact the men do\r\nneither, but all the correspondence of kings and princes, and the\r\ndiplomatic documents, and notices, and so forth, are one and all, almost\r\nwithout a single exception, drawn up by women. They know the secret and\r\nhidden motives of courts, and have this great advantage, that they can\r\nuse their knowledge without personal fear, since women are never\r\nseriously interfered with, but are protected by all.\r\n\r\nThe one terrible and utterly shameful instance to the contrary had not\r\noccurred at the time of which we are now speaking, and it was and is\r\nstill repudiated by every man, from the knight to the boys who gather\r\nacorns for the swine. Oliver himself had no idea whatever that he was\r\nregarded as a favourite lover of the Duchess; he took the welcome that\r\nwas held out to him as perfectly honest. Plain, straightforward, and\r\nhonest, Oliver, had he been openly singled out by a queen, would have\r\nscorned to give himself an air for such a reason. But the Baron, deep in\r\nintrigue this many a year, looked more profoundly into the possibilities\r\nof the future when he kept the young knight at his side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nSUPERSTITIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nFelix was now outside the town and alone in the meadow which bordered\r\nthe stream; he knelt, and drank from it with the hollow of his hand. He\r\nwas going to ascend the hill beyond, and had already reached the barrier\r\nupon that side, when he recollected that etiquette demanded the presence\r\nof the guests at meal-times, and it was now the hour for tea. He\r\nhastened back, and found the courtyard of the castle crowded. Within,\r\nthe staircase leading to the Baroness's chamber (where tea was served)\r\ncould scarcely be ascended, what with the ladies and their courtiers,\r\nthe long trains of the serving-women, the pages winding their way in and\r\nout, the servants endeavouring to pass, the slender pet greyhounds, the\r\ninseparable companions of their mistresses.\r\n\r\nBy degrees, and exercising patience, he gained the upper floor and\r\nentered the drawing-room. The Baroness alone sat at the table, the\r\nguests wheresoever they chose, or chance carried them; for the most part\r\nthey stood, or leaned against the recess of the open window. Of tea\r\nitself there was none; there had been no tea to be had for love or money\r\nthese fifty years past, and, indeed, its use would have been forgotten,\r\nand the name only survived, had not some small quantities been yet\r\npreserved and brought out on rare occasions at the palaces. Instead,\r\nthere was chicory prepared from the root of the plant, grown for the\r\npurpose; fresh milk; fine ale and mead; and wine from Gloucester.\r\nButter, honey, and cake were also on the table.\r\n\r\nThe guests helped themselves, or waited till the servants came to them\r\nwith wooden carved trays. The particular characteristic of tea is the\r\nfreedom from restraint; it is not considered necessary to sit as at\r\ndinner or supper, nor to do as others do; each pleases himself, and\r\nthere is no ceremony. Yet, although so near Aurora, Felix did not\r\nsucceed in speaking to her; Durand still engaged her attention whenever\r\nother ladies were not talking with her. Felix found himself, exactly as\r\nat dinner-time, quite outside the circle. There was a buzz of\r\nconversation around, but not a word of it was addressed to him. Dresses\r\nbrushed against him, but the fair owners were not concerned even to\r\nacknowledge his existence.\r\n\r\nPushed by the jostling crowd aside from the centre of the floor, Felix\r\npresently sat down, glad to rest at last, behind the open door.\r\nForgotten, he forgot; and, looking as it were out of the present in a\r\nbitter reverie, scarcely knew where he was, except at moments when he\r\nheard the well-known and loved voice of Aurora. A servant after a while\r\ncame to him with a tray; he took some honey and bread. Almost\r\nimmediately afterwards another servant came and presented him with a\r\nplate, on which was a cup of wine, saying, \"With my lady's loving\r\nwishes.\"\r\n\r\nAs in duty bound, he rose and bowed to the Baroness; she smiled and\r\nnodded; the circle which had looked to see who was thus honoured, turned\r\naside again, not recognising him. To send a guest a plate with wine or\r\nfood is the highest mark of esteem, and this plate in especial was of\r\nalmost priceless value, as Felix saw when his confusion had abated. It\r\nwas of the ancient china, now not to be found in even the houses of the\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\nIn all that kingdom but five perfect plates were known to exist, and two\r\nof these were at the palace. They are treasured as heirlooms, and, if\r\never broken, can never be replaced. The very fragments are rare; they\r\nare often set in panels, and highly prized. The Baroness, glancing round\r\nher court, had noticed at last the young man sitting in the obscure\r\ncorner behind the door; she remembered, not without some twinge of\r\nconscience, that his house was their ancient ally and sworn\r\nhearth-friend.\r\n\r\nShe knew, far better than the Baron, how deeply her daughter loved him;\r\nbetter, perhaps, even than Aurora herself. She, too, naturally hoped a\r\nhigher alliance for Aurora; yet she was a true woman, and her heart was\r\nstronger than her ambition. The trifle of the wine was, of course,\r\nnothing; but it was open and marked recognition. She expected that Felix\r\n(after his wont in former times, before love or marriage was thought of\r\nfor Aurora) would have come upon this distinct invitation, and taken his\r\nstand behind her, after the custom. But as he did not come, fresh guests\r\nand the duties of hospitality distracted her attention, and she again\r\nforgot him.\r\n\r\nHe was, indeed, more hurt than pleased with the favour that had been\r\nshown him; it seemed to him (though really prompted by the kindest\r\nfeeling) like a bone cast at a dog. He desired to be so regarded that no\r\nspecial mark of favour should be needed. It simply increased his\r\ndiscontent. The evening wore on, the supper began; how weary it seemed\r\nto him, that long and jovial supper, with the ale that ran in a\r\ncontinual stream, the wine that ceaselessly circled round, the jokes,\r\nand bustle, and laughter, the welcome to guests arriving; the cards, and\r\nchess, and games that succeeded it, the drinking, and drinking, and\r\ndrinking, till the ladies again left; then drinking yet more freely.\r\n\r\nHe slipped away at the first opportunity, and having first strolled to\r\nand fro on the bowling green, wet with dew, at the rear of the castle,\r\nasked for his bedroom. It was some time before he could get attended to;\r\nhe stood alone at the foot of the staircase while others went first\r\n(their small coins bought them attention), till at last a lamp was\r\nbrought to him, and his chamber named. This chamber, such as it was, was\r\nthe only pleasure, and that a melancholy one, he had had that day.\r\n\r\nThough overflowing with guests, so that the most honoured visitors could\r\nnot be accommodated within the castle, and only the ladies could find\r\nsleeping room there, yet the sacred law of honour, the pledge of the\r\nhearth-friend passed three generations ago, secured him this privilege.\r\nThe hearth-friend must sleep within, if a king were sent without.\r\nOliver, of course, would occupy the same room, but he was drinking and\r\nshouting a song below, so that for a while Felix had the chamber to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nIt pleased him, because it was the room in which he had always slept\r\nwhen he visited the place from a boy, when, half afraid and yet\r\ndetermined to venture, he had first come through the lonely forest\r\nalone. How well he remembered that first time! the autumn sunshine on\r\nthe stubble at Old House, and the red and brown leaves of the forest as\r\nhe entered; how he entered on foot, and twice turned back, and twice\r\nadventured again, till he got so deep into the forest that it seemed as\r\nfar to return as to advance. How he started at the sudden bellow of two\r\nstags, and the clatter of their horns as they fought in the brake close\r\nby, and how beautiful the castle looked when presently he emerged from\r\nthe bushes and looked down upon it!\r\n\r\nThis was the very room he slept in; the Baroness, mother-like, came to\r\nsee that he was comfortable. Here he had slept every time since; here he\r\nhad listened in the early morning for Aurora's footfall as she passed\r\nhis door, for the ladies rose earlier than did the men. He now sat down\r\nby the open window; it was a brilliant moonlight night, warm and\r\ndelicious, and the long-drawn note of the nightingale came across the\r\ngardens from the hawthorn bushes without the inner stockade. To the left\r\nhe could see the line of the hills, to the right the forest; all was\r\nquiet there, but every now and then the sound of a ballad came round the\r\ncastle, a sound without recognizable words, inarticulate merriment.\r\n\r\nIf he started upon the hazardous voyage he contemplated, and for which\r\nhe had been so long preparing, should he ever sleep there again, so near\r\nthe one he loved? Was it not better to be poor and despised, but near\r\nher, than to attempt such an expedition, especially as the chances (as\r\nhis common sense told him) were all against him? Yet he could not stay;\r\nhe _must_ do it, and he tried to stifle the doubt which insisted upon\r\narising in his mind. Then he recurred to Durand; he remembered that not\r\nonce on that day had he exchanged one single word, beyond the first and\r\nordinary salutation, with Aurora.\r\n\r\nMight she not, had she chosen, have arranged a moment's interview? Might\r\nshe not easily have given him an opportunity? Was it not clear that she\r\nwas ashamed of her girlish fancy for a portionless and despised youth?\r\nIf so, was it worth while to go upon so strange an enterprise for her\r\nsake? But if so, also, was life worth living, and might he not as well\r\ngo and seek destruction?\r\n\r\nWhile this conflict of feeling was proceeding, he chanced to look\r\ntowards the table upon which he had carelessly placed his lamp, and\r\nobserved, what in his agitated state of mind he had previously\r\noverlooked, a small roll of manuscript tied round with silk. Curious in\r\nbooks, he undid the fastening, and opened the volume. There was not much\r\nwriting, but many singular diagrams, and signs arranged in circles. It\r\nwas, in fact, a book of magic, written at the dictation, as the preface\r\nstated, of one who had been for seven years a slave among the Romany.\r\n\r\nHe had been captured, and forced to work for the tent to which his\r\nowners belonged. He had witnessed their worship and their sorceries; he\r\nhad seen the sacrifice to the full moon, their chief goddess, and the\r\nwild extravagances with which it was accompanied. He had learnt some few\r\nof their signs, and, upon escaping, had reproduced them from memory.\r\nSome were engraved on the stones set in their rings; some were carved on\r\nwooden tablets, some drawn with ink on parchment; but, with all, their\r\nprocedure seemed to be the repetition of certain verses, and then a\r\nsteady gaze upon the picture. Presently they became filled with rapture,\r\nuttered what sounded as the wildest ravings, and (their women\r\nespecially) prophesied of the future.\r\n\r\nA few of the signs he understood the meaning of, but the others he owned\r\nwere unknown to him. At the end of the book were several pages of\r\ncommentary, describing the demons believed in and worshipped by the\r\nRomany, demons which haunted the woods and hills, and against which it\r\nwas best to be provided with amulets blessed by the holy fathers of St.\r\nAugustine. Such demons stole on the hunter at noonday, and, alarmed at\r\nthe sudden appearance, upon turning his head (for demons invariably\r\napproach from behind, and their presence is indicated by a shudder in\r\nthe back), he toppled into pits hidden by fern, and was killed.\r\n\r\nOr, in the shape of a dog, they ran between the traveller's legs; or as\r\nwoman, with tempting caresses, lured him from the way at nightfall into\r\nthe leafy recesses, and then instantaneously changing into vast bat-like\r\nforms, fastened on his throat and sucked his blood. The terrible screams\r\nof such victims had often been heard by the warders at the outposts.\r\nSome were invisible, and yet slew the unwary by descending unseen upon\r\nhim, and choking him with a pressure as if the air had suddenly become\r\nheavy.\r\n\r\nBut none of these were, perhaps, so much to be dreaded as the\r\nsweetly-formed and graceful ladies of the fern. These were creatures,\r\nnot of flesh and blood, and yet not incorporeal like the demons, nor\r\nwere they dangerous to the physical man, doing no bodily injury. The\r\nharm they did was by fascinating the soul so that it revolted from all\r\nreligion and all the rites of the Church. Once resigned to the caress of\r\nthe fern-woman, the unfortunate was lured farther and farther from the\r\nhaunts of men, until at last he wandered into the unknown forest, and\r\nwas never seen again. These creatures were usually found among the brake\r\nfern, nude, but the lower limbs and body hidden by the green fronds,\r\ntheir white arms and shoulders alone visible, and their golden hair\r\naglow with the summer sunshine.\r\n\r\nDemons there were, too, of the streams, and demons dwelling in the midst\r\nof the hills; demons that could travel only in the moonbeams, and others\r\nthat floated before the stormy winds and hurled the wretched wanderer to\r\ndestruction, or crushed him with the overthrown trees. In proof of this\r\nthe monk asked the reader if he had not heard of huge boughs falling\r\nfrom trees without visible cause, suddenly and without warning, and even\r\nof trees themselves in full foliage, in calm weather, toppling with a\r\ncrash, to the imminent danger or the death of those who happened to be\r\npassing. Let all these purchase the amulets of St. Augustine, concluded\r\nthe writer, who it appeared was a monk in whose monastery the escaped\r\nprisoner had taken refuge, and who had written down his relation and\r\ncopied his rude sketches.\r\n\r\nFelix pored over the strange diagrams, striving to understand the hidden\r\nmeaning; some of them he thought were alchemical signs, and related to\r\nthe making of gold, especially as the prisoner stated the Romany\r\npossessed much more of that metal in the tents than he had seen in the\r\npalaces of our kings. Whether they had a gold mine from whence they drew\r\nit, or whether they had the art of transmutation, he knew not, but he\r\nhad heard allusions to the wealth in the mountain of the apple trees,\r\nwhich he supposed to be a mystical phrase.\r\n\r\nWhen Felix at last looked up, the lamp was low, the moonbeams had\r\nentered and fell upon the polished floor, and from the window he could\r\nsee a long white ghostly line of mist where a streamlet ran at the base\r\nof the slope by the forest. The songs were silent; there was no sound\r\nsave the distant neigh of a horse and the heavy tramp of a guest coming\r\nalong the gallery. Half bewildered by poring over the magic scroll, full\r\nof the signs and the demons, and still with a sense of injury and\r\njealousy cankering his heart, Felix retired to his couch, and, weary\r\nbeyond measure, instantly fell asleep.\r\n\r\nIn his unsettled state of mind it did not once occur to him to ask\r\nhimself how the manuscript came to be upon his table. Rare as they were,\r\nbooks were not usually put upon the tables of guests, and at an ordinary\r\ntime he would certainly have thought it peculiar. The fact was, that\r\nAurora, whom all day he had inwardly accused of forgetting him, had\r\nplaced it there for him with her own hands. She, too, was curious in\r\nbooks and fond of study. She had very recently bought the volume from a\r\nmerchant who had come thus far, and who valued it the least of all his\r\nwares.\r\n\r\nShe knew that Felix had read and re-read every other scrap of writing\r\nthere was in the castle, and thought that this strange book might\r\ninterest him, giving, as it did, details of those powers of the air in\r\nwhich almost all fully believed. Unconscious of this attention, Felix\r\nfell asleep, angry and bitter against her. When, half an hour\r\nafterwards, Oliver blundered into the room, a little unsteady on his\r\nlegs, notwithstanding his mighty strength, he picked up the roll,\r\nglanced at it, flung it down with contempt, and without a minute's delay\r\nsought and obtained slumber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE FEAST\r\n\r\n\r\nAt ten in the morning next day the feast began with a drama from\r\nSophocles, which was performed in the open air. The theatre was in the\r\ngardens between the wall and the inner stockade; the spectators sat on\r\nthe slope, tier above tier; the actors appeared upon a green terrace\r\nbelow, issuing from an arbour and passing off behind a thick box-hedge\r\non the other side of the terrace. There was no scenery whatever.\r\n\r\nAurora had selected the Antigone. There were not many dramatists from\r\nwhom to choose, for so many English writers, once famous, had dropped\r\nout of knowledge and disappeared. Yet some of the far more ancient Greek\r\nand Roman classics remained because they contained depth and originality\r\nof ideas in small compass. They had been copied in manuscripts by\r\nthoughtful men from the old printed books before they mouldered away,\r\nand their manuscripts being copied again, these works were handed down.\r\nThe books which came into existence with printing had never been copied\r\nby the pen, and had consequently nearly disappeared. Extremely long and\r\ndiffuse, it was found, too, that so many of them were but enlargements\r\nof ideas or sentiments which had been expressed in a few words by the\r\nclassics. It is so much easier to copy an epigram of two lines than a\r\nprinted book of hundreds of pages, and hence it was that Sophocles had\r\nsurvived while much more recent writers had been lost.\r\n\r\nFrom a translation Aurora had arranged several of his dramas. Antigone\r\nwas her favourite, and she wished Felix to see it. In some indefinable\r\nmanner the spirit of the ancient Greeks seemed to her in accord with the\r\ntimes, for men had or appeared to have so little control over their own\r\nlives that they might well imagine themselves overruled by destiny.\r\nCommunication between one place and another was difficult, the division\r\nof society into castes, and the iron tyranny of arms, prevented the\r\nindividual from making any progress in lifting himself out of the groove\r\nin which he was born, except by the rarest opportunity, unless specially\r\nfavoured by fortune. As men were born so they lived; they could not\r\nadvance, and when this is the case the idea of Fate is always\r\npredominant. The workings of destiny, the Irresistible overpowering both\r\nthe good and the evil-disposed, such as were traced in the Greek drama,\r\nwere paralleled in the lives of many a miserable slave at that day. They\r\nwere forced to endure, for there was no possibility of effort.\r\n\r\nAurora saw this and felt it deeply; ever anxious as she was for the good\r\nof all, she saw the sadness that reigned even in the midst of the fresh\r\nfoliage of spring and among the flowers. It was Fate; it was Sophocles.\r\n\r\nShe took the part of the heroine herself, clad in Greek costume; Felix\r\nlistened and watched, absorbed in his love. Never had that ancient drama\r\nappeared so beautiful as then, in the sunlight; the actors stepped upon\r\nthe daisied sward, and the song of birds was all their music.\r\n\r\nWhile the play was still proceeding, those who were to form the usual\r\nprocession had already been assembling in the court before the castle,\r\nand just after noon, to the sound of the trumpet, the Baron, with his\r\nyoungest son beside him (the eldest was at Court), left the porch,\r\nwearing his fur-lined short mantle, his collar, and golden spurs, and\r\nthe decoration won so many years before; all the insignia of his rank.\r\nHe walked; his war-horse, fully caparisoned, with axe at the saddle-bow,\r\nwas led at his right side, and upon the other came a knight carrying the\r\nbanneret of the house.\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen of the house followed closely, duly marshalled in ranks,\r\nand wearing the gayest dress; the leading retainers fully armed, brought\r\nup the rear. Immediately upon issuing from the gate of the wall, the\r\nprocession was met and surrounded by the crowd, carrying large branches\r\nof may in bloom, flowers, and green willow boughs. The flowers they\r\nflung before him on the ground; the branches they bore with them,\r\nchanting old verses in honour of the family. The route was through the\r\ntown, where the Baron stopped at the door of the Court House, and\r\nproclaimed a free pardon to all serfs (who were released within a few\r\nminutes) not guilty of the heavier crimes.\r\n\r\nThence he went to the pasture just beyond, carefully mown close and\r\nswept for the purpose, where the May-pole stood, wreathed with flowers\r\nand green branches. Beneath it he deposited a bag of money for\r\ndistribution upon a carved butt placed there, the signal that the games\r\nwere open. Instantly the fiddles began to play, and the feast really\r\ncommenced. At the inns ale was served out freely (at the Baron's\r\ncharge), carts, too, came down from the castle laden with ale and cooked\r\nprovisions. Wishing them joy, the Baron returned by the same road to the\r\ncastle, where dinner was already served in the hall and the sheds that\r\nhad been erected to enlarge the accommodation.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon there were foot-races, horse-races, and leaping\r\ncompetitions, and the dances about the May-pole were prolonged far into\r\nthe night. The second day, early in the morning, the barriers were\r\nopened, and trials of skill with the blunt sword, jousting with the\r\nblunt lance at the quintain, and wrestling began, and continued almost\r\ntill sunset. Tournament with sharpened lance or sword, when the\r\ncombatants fight with risk of serious wounds, can take place only in the\r\npresence of the Prince or his deputy. But in these conflicts\r\nsufficiently severe blows were given to disable the competitors.\r\n\r\nOn the third day there was a set battle in the morning between fifteen\r\nmen on each side, armed with the usual buckler or small shield, and\r\nstout single-sticks instead of swords. This combat excited more interest\r\nthan all the duels that had preceded it; the crowd almost broke down the\r\nbarriers, and the cheering and cries of encouragement could be heard\r\nupon the hills. Thrice the combatants rested from the engagement, and\r\nthrice at the trumpet call started again to meet each other, at least\r\nthose who had sustained the first onslaught.\r\n\r\nBlood, indeed, was not shed (for the iron morions saved their skulls),\r\nbut nearly half of the number required assistance to reach the tents\r\npitched for their use. Then came more feasting, the final dinner\r\nprolonged till six in the evening, when the company, constantly rising\r\nfrom their seats, cheered the Baron, and drank to the prosperity of the\r\nhouse. After the horn blew at six, the guests who had come from a\r\ndistance rapidly dispersed (their horses were already waiting), for they\r\nwere anxious to pass the fifteen miles of forest before nightfall. Those\r\non foot, and those ladies who had come in covered waggons, stayed till\r\nnext morning, as they could not travel so speedily. By seven or eight\r\nthe castle courtyard was comparatively empty, and the Baron, weary from\r\nthe mere bodily efforts of saying farewell to so many, had flung himself\r\nat full length on a couch in the drawing-room.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of this time Felix had not obtained a single moment\r\nwith Aurora; her time, when not occupied in attending to the guests, was\r\nalways claimed by Lord Durand. Felix, after the short-lived but pure\r\npleasure he had enjoyed in watching her upon the grass-grown stage, had\r\nendured three days of misery. He was among the crowd, he was in the\r\ncastle itself, he sat at table with the most honoured visitors, yet he\r\nwas distinct from all. There was no sympathy between them and him. The\r\ngames, the dancing, the feasting and laughter, the ceaseless singing and\r\nshouting, and jovial jostling, jarred upon him.\r\n\r\nThe boundless interest the people took in the combats, and especially\r\nthat of the thirty, seemed to him a strange and inexplicable phenomenon.\r\nIt did not excite him in the least; he could turn his back upon it\r\nwithout hesitation. He would, indeed, have left the crowd, and spent the\r\nday in the forest, or on the hills, but he could not leave Aurora. He\r\nmust be near her; he must see her, though he was miserable. Now he\r\nfeared that the last moment would come, and that he should not exchange\r\na word with her.\r\n\r\nHe could not, with any show of pretext, prolong his stay beyond the\r\nsunset; all were already gone, with the exceptions mentioned. It would\r\nbe against etiquette to remain longer, unless specially invited, and he\r\nwas not specially invited. Yet he lingered, and lingered. His horse was\r\nready below; the groom, weary of holding the bridle, had thrown it over\r\nan iron hook in the yard, and gone about other business. The sun\r\nperceptibly declined, and the shadow of the beeches of the forest began\r\nto descend the grassy slope. Still he stayed, restlessly moving, now in\r\nthe dining chamber, now in the hall, now at the foot of the staircase,\r\nwith an unpleasant feeling that the servants looked at him curiously,\r\nand were watching him.\r\n\r\nOliver had gone long since, riding with his new friend Lord Durand; they\r\nmust by now be half-way through the forest. Forced by the inexorable\r\nflight of time, he put his foot upon the staircase to go up to the\r\ndrawing-room and bid farewell to the Baroness. He ascended it, step by\r\nstep, as a condemned person goes to his doom. He stayed to look out of\r\nthe open windows as he went by; anything to excuse delay to himself. He\r\nreached the landing at last, and had taken two steps towards the door,\r\nwhen Aurora's maid, who had been waiting there an hour or more for the\r\nopportunity, brushed past him, and whispered, \"The Rose arbour.\"\r\n\r\nWithout a word he turned, hastened down the stairs, ran through the\r\ncastle yard, out at the gate, and, entering the gardens between the wall\r\nand the inner stockade, made for the arbour on the terrace where the\r\ndrama had been enacted. Aurora was not there; but as he looked round,\r\ndisappointed, she came from the Filbert walk, and, taking his arm, led\r\nhim to the arbour. They sat down without a word. In a moment she placed\r\nher head upon his shoulder; he did not respond. She put her arm (how\r\nwarm it felt!) about his neck; he yielded stiffly and ungraciously to\r\nthe pressure; she drew down his head, and kissed him. His lips touched\r\nbut did not press hers; they met, but did not join. In his sullen and\r\nangry silence he would not look. She drew still nearer, and whispered\r\nhis name.\r\n\r\nThen he broke out: he pushed her away; his petty jealousy and injured\r\nself-esteem poured out upon her.\r\n\r\n\"I am not the heir to an earldom,\" he said; \"I do not ride with a score\r\nof gentlemen at my back. They have some wonderful diamonds, have they\r\nnot--_Countess?_\"\r\n\r\n\"Felix!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is no use. Yes, your voice is sweet, I know. But you, all of you,\r\ndespise me. I am nothing, no one!\"\r\n\r\n\"You are all, _everything_, to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were with--with Durand the whole time.\"\r\n\r\n\"I could not help myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not help yourself! Do you think I believe that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Felix, dear. I tell you I could not help myself; I could not, indeed.\r\nYou do not know all--\"\r\n\r\n\"No, probably not. I do not know the terms of the marriage contract.\"\r\n\r\n\"Felix, there is no such thing. Why, what has come to you? How pale you\r\nlook! Sit down!\" for he had risen.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot, Aurora, dear; I cannot! Oh, what shall I do? I love you so!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nAURORA\r\n\r\n\r\nFelix fell on the seat beside her, burying his face in the folds of her\r\ndress; he sobbed, not with tears, but choking passion. She held him to\r\nher heart as if he had been a child, stroking his hair and kissing it,\r\nwhispering to him, assuring him that her love was his, that she was\r\nunchanged. She told him that it was not her fault. A little while before\r\nthe feast the Baron had suddenly broken out into a fit of temper, such\r\nas she had never seen him indulge in previously; the cause was pressure\r\nput upon him by his creditors. Unpleasant truths had escaped him;\r\namongst the rest, his dislike, his positive disapproval of the tacit\r\nengagement they had entered into.\r\n\r\nHe declared that if the least outward sign of it appeared before the\r\nguests that were expected, he would order Felix to leave the place, and\r\ncancel the hearth-friendship, no matter what the consequence. It was\r\nclear that he was set upon a wealthy and powerful alliance for her; that\r\nthe Earl was either coming, or would send his son, he knew; and he knew\r\nthat nothing so repels a possible suitor as the rumour that the lady has\r\na previous engagement. In short, he made it a condition of Felix's\r\npresence being tolerated at all, that Aurora should carefully abstain\r\nfrom showing the slightest attention to him; that she should ignore his\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nNor could she prevent Durand following her without a marked refusal to\r\nlisten to his conversation, a refusal which would most certainly at once\r\nhave brought about the dreaded explosion. She thought it better, under\r\nthe circumstances, to preserve peace, lest intercourse between her and\r\nFelix should be entirely broken off for ever. This was the secret\r\nhistory of the apparent indifference and neglect which had so deeply\r\nhurt him. The explanation, accompanied as it was with so many tender\r\nexpressions and caresses, soothed him; he returned her kisses and became\r\ncalmer. He could not doubt her, for in his heart he had suspected\r\nsomething of the kind long since.\r\n\r\nYet it was not so much the explanation itself, nor even the love she\r\npoured upon him, as the mere fact of her presence so near that brought\r\nhim to himself. The influence of her steadfast nature, of her clear,\r\nbroad, straightforward view of things, the decision of her character,\r\nthe high, unselfish motives which animated her, all together supplied\r\nthat which was wanting in himself. His indecision, his too\r\nimpressionable disposition, which checked and stayed the force of his\r\ntalent, and counteracted the determination of a naturally iron will;\r\nthese, as it were, were relieved; in a word, with her he became himself.\r\n\r\nHow many times he had told her as much! How many times she had replied\r\nthat it was not herself, but that in which she believed, that was the\r\nreal cause of this feeling! It was that ancient and true religion; the\r\nreligion of the primitive church, as she found it in the fragments of\r\nthe Scriptures that had come down from the ancients.\r\n\r\nAurora had learnt this faith from childhood; it was, indeed, a tradition\r\nof the house preserved unbroken these hundred years in the midst of the\r\njarring creeds, whose disciples threatened and destroyed each other. On\r\nthe one hand, the gorgeous rite of the Vice-Pope, with the priests and\r\nthe monks, claimed dominion, and really held a large share, both over\r\nthe body and the soul; on the other, the Leaguers, with their bold,\r\nharsh, and flowerless creed, were equally over-bearing and equally\r\nbigoted. Around them the Bushmen wandered without a god; the Romany\r\ncalled upon the full moon. Within courts and cities the gay and the\r\nlearned alike mocked at all faith, and believed in gold alone.\r\n\r\nCruelty reigned everywhere; mercy, except in the name of honour, there\r\nwas none; humanity was unknown. A few, a very few only, had knowledge of\r\nor held to the leading tenets, which, in the time of the ancients, were\r\nassented to by everyone, such as the duty of humanity to all, the duty\r\nof saving and protecting life, of kindness and gentleness. These few,\r\nwith their pastors, simple and unassuming, had no power or influence;\r\nyet they existed here and there, a living protest against the\r\nlawlessness and brutality of the time.\r\n\r\nAmong these the house of Thyma had in former days been conspicuous, but\r\nof late years the barons of Thyma had, more from policy than from aught\r\nelse, rather ignored their ancestral faith, leaning towards the League,\r\nwhich was then powerful in that kingdom. To have acted otherwise would\r\nhave been to exclude himself from all appointments. But Aurora, learning\r\nthe old faith at her mother's knee, had become too deeply imbued with\r\nits moral beauty to consent to this course. By degrees, as she grew up,\r\nit became in her a passion; more than a faith, a passion; the object of\r\nher life.\r\n\r\nA girl, indeed, can do but little in our iron days, but that little she\r\ndid. The chapel beside the castle, long since fallen to decay, was, at\r\nher earnest request, repaired; a pastor came and remained as chaplain,\r\nand services, of the simplest kind, but serious and full of meaning,\r\ntook place twice a week. To these she drew as many as possible of the\r\ninhabitants of the enclosure; some even came from afar once now and then\r\nto attend them. Correspondence was carried on with the remnant of the\r\nfaith.\r\n\r\nThat no one might plead ignorance (for there was up to the date no\r\nwritten record) Aurora set herself the task of reducing the traditions\r\nwhich had been handed down to writing. When the manuscript was at last\r\ncompleted it occupied her months to transcribe copies of it for\r\ncirculation; and she still continued to make copies, which were sent by\r\nmessengers and by the travelling merchants to the markets, and even\r\nacross the sea. Apart from its intrinsically elevating character, the\r\nmere mental labour expended on this work had undoubtedly strengthened a\r\nnaturally fine intellect. As she said, it was the faith, the hope that\r\nthat faith would one day be recognised, which gave her so much influence\r\nover others.\r\n\r\nUpon this one thing only they differed; Felix did not oppose, did not\r\neven argue, he was simply untouched. It was not that he believed in\r\nanything else, nor that he doubted; he was merely indifferent. He had\r\ntoo great a natural aptitude for the physical sciences, and too clear a\r\nmind, to accept that which was taught by the one or the other of the two\r\nchief opposing parties. Nor could he join in the ridicule and derision\r\nof the gay courtiers, for the mystery of existence had impressed him\r\ndeeply while wandering alone in the forest. But he stood aloof; he\r\nsmiled and listened, unconvinced; like the wild creatures of the forest,\r\nhe had no ears for these matters. He loved Aurora, that was all.\r\n\r\nBut he felt the influence just the same; with all his powers of mind and\r\ncontempt of superstitions in others, he could not at times shake off the\r\napprehensions aroused by untoward omens, as when he stepped upon the\r\nadder in the woods. Aurora knew nothing of such things; her faith was\r\nclear and bright like a star; nothing could alarm her, or bring\r\nuneasiness of mind. This beautiful calm, not cold, but glowing with hope\r\nand love, soothed him.\r\n\r\nThat evening, with her hope and love, with her message of trust, she\r\nalmost persuaded him. He almost turned to what she had so long taught.\r\nHe almost repented of that hardness of heart, that unutterable distance,\r\nas it were, between him and other men, which lay at the bottom of his\r\nproposed expedition. He opened his lips to confess to her his purpose,\r\nand had he done so assuredly she would have persuaded him from it. But\r\nin the very act of speaking, he hesitated. It was characteristic of him\r\nto do so. Whether she instinctively felt that there was something\r\nconcealed from her, or guessed that the discontent she knew he had so\r\nlong endured was coming to a point, or feared lest what she had told him\r\nmight drive him to some ill-considered act, she begged him with all the\r\npower of her love to do nothing hasty, or in despair, nothing that would\r\nseparate them. He threw his arms around her, he pressed her closely to\r\nhim, he trembled with the passion and the struggle within him.\r\n\r\n\"My lady calls for you, Mademoiselle,\" said a voice; it was Aurora's\r\nmaid who had kept watch. \"She has asked for you some time since. Someone\r\nis coming into the garden!\"\r\n\r\nThere was no help for it; Aurora kissed him, and was gone before he\r\ncould come to himself. How long the interview had lasted (time flies\r\nswiftly in such sweet intercourse), or how long he sat there after she\r\nleft, he could not tell; but when he went out already the dusk was\r\ngathering, the sun had gone down, and in the east the as yet pale orb of\r\nthe moon was rising over the hills. As if in a dream he walked with\r\nunsteady steps to the castle stable; his horse had been put back, and\r\nthe grooms suggested to him that it was better not to attempt the forest\r\nat night. But he was determined; he gave them all the coin he had about\r\nhim, it was not much, but more than they had expected.\r\n\r\nThey ran beside him to the barrier; advising him as they ran, as he\r\nwould go, to string his bow and loosen an arrow in the girdle, and above\r\nall, not to loiter, or let his horse walk, but to keep him at as sharp a\r\ntrot as he could. The fact that so many wealthy persons had assembled at\r\nthe castle for the feast would be sure to be known to the banditti (the\r\noutlaws of the cities and the escaped serfs). They were certain to be on\r\nthe look out for travellers; let him beware.\r\n\r\nHis ears tingled and his head felt hot, as if the blood had rushed into\r\nit (it was the violence of the emotion that he had felt), as he rode\r\nfrom the barrier, hearing, and yet without conscious knowledge of what\r\nthey said. They watched him up the slope, and saw him disappear from\r\nsight under the dark beeches of the forest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nNIGHT IN THE FOREST\r\n\r\n\r\nAt first Felix rode quickly, but his horse stumbling, though accustomed\r\nto the woods, warned him to be more careful. The passage of so many\r\nhorsemen in the last few days had cut up and destroyed the track, which\r\nwas nothing but a green path, and the covered waggons had of course\r\nassisted in rendering it rough and broken. He therefore rode slowly, and\r\ngiving his horse his head, he picked his way of his own accord at the\r\nside of the road, often brushing against the underwood.\r\n\r\nStill, indeed, absorbed by the feelings which had almost mastered him in\r\nthe arbour, and thinking of Aurora, he forgot where he was, till the\r\ndismal howling of wood-dogs deep in the forest woke him. It was almost\r\npitch dark under the tall beeches, the highest of the trees preventing\r\nthe beams of the moon from illuminating the path till later in the\r\nnight. Like a curtain the thick foliage above shut out the sky, so that\r\nno star was visible. When the wood-dogs ceased there was no sound beyond\r\nthe light fall of the horse's hoofs as he walked upon the grass.\r\nDarkness and silence prevailed; he could see nothing. He spoke to his\r\nhorse and patted his neck; he stepped a little faster and lifted his\r\nhead, which he had held low as if making his way by scent.\r\n\r\nThe gloom weighed upon him, unhappy as he was. Often as he had\r\nvoluntarily sought the loneliness of the woods, now in this state of\r\nmind, it oppressed him; he remembered that beyond the beeches the ground\r\nwas open and cleared by a forest fire, and began to be anxious to reach\r\nit. It seemed an hour, but it really was only a few minutes, when the\r\nbeeches became thinner and wider apart, the foliage above ceased, and\r\nthe stars shone. Before him was the open space he had desired, sloping\r\nto the right hand, the tall grass grey-green in the moonlight, and near\r\nat hand sparkling with dew.\r\n\r\nAmongst it stood the crooked and charred stems of furze with which it\r\nhad been covered before the fire passed. A white owl floated rather than\r\nflew by, following the edge of the forest; from far down the slope came\r\nthe chattering notes of a brook-sparrow, showing that there was water in\r\nthe hollow. Some large animal moved into the white mist that hung there\r\nand immediately concealed it, like a cloud upon the ground. He was not\r\ncertain in the dim light, and with so momentary and distant a view, but\r\nsupposed from its size that it must have been a white or dun wood-cow.\r\n\r\nAhead, across the open, rose the dark top of the fir trees through which\r\nthe route ran. Instead of the relief which he had anticipated as he rode\r\ntowards them, the space clear of trees around seemed to expose him to\r\nthe full view of all that might be lurking in the forest. As he\r\napproached the firs and saw how dark it was beneath them, the shadowy\r\ndepths suggested uncertain shapes hiding therein, and his memory\r\nimmediately reverted to the book of magic he had read at the castle.\r\n\r\nThere could not be such things, and yet no one in his heart doubted\r\ntheir existence; deny it as they might with their tongues as they sat at\r\nthe supper-table and handed round the ale, out of doors in the night,\r\nthe haste to pass the haunted spot, the bated breath, and the fearful\r\nglances cast around, told another tale. He endeavoured to call\r\nphilosophy to his aid; he remembered, too, how many nights he had spent\r\nin the deepest forest without seeing anything, and without even thinking\r\nof such matters. He reproved himself for his folly, and asked himself if\r\never he could hope to be a successful leader of men who started at a\r\nshadow. In vain: the tone of his mind had been weakened by the strain it\r\nhad undergone.\r\n\r\nInstead of strengthening him, the teachings of philosophy now seemed\r\ncold and feeble, and it occurred to him that possibly the belief of the\r\ncommon people (fully shared by their religious instructors) was just as\r\nmuch entitled to credence as these mere suppositions and theories. The\r\ndetails of the volume recurred to his mind; the accurate description of\r\nthe demons of the forest and the hill, and especially the horrible\r\nvampires enfolding the victim with outstretched wings. In spite of\r\nhimself, incredulous, yet excited, he pressed his horse to greater\r\nspeed, though the track was narrow and very much broken under the firs.\r\nHe obeyed, and trotted, but reluctantly, and needed continual urging.\r\n\r\nThe yellow spark of a glowworm shining by a bush made him set his teeth;\r\ntrifling and well known as it was, the light suddenly seen thrilled him\r\nwith the terror of the unexpected. Strange rushings sounded among the\r\nfern, as if the wings of a demon brushed it as he travelled. Felix knew\r\nthat they were caused by rabbits hastening off, or a boar bounding away,\r\nyet they increased the feverish excitement with which he was burdened.\r\nThough dark beneath the firs, it was not like the darkness of the\r\nbeeches; these trees did not form a perfect canopy overhead everywhere.\r\nIn places he could see where a streak of moonlight came aslant through\r\nan opening and reached the ground. One such streak fell upon the track\r\nahead; the trees there had decayed and fallen, and a broad band of light\r\nlit up the way.\r\n\r\nAs he approached it and had almost entered, suddenly something shot\r\ntowards him in the air; a flash, as it were, as if some object had\r\ncrossed the streak, and was rendered visible for the tenth of a second,\r\nlike a mote in the sunbeams. At the same instant of time, the horse,\r\nwhich he had pressed to go faster, put his foot into a rut or hole, and\r\nstumbled, and Felix was flung so far forward that he only saved himself\r\nfrom being thrown by clinging to his neck. A slight whizzing sound\r\npassed over his head, followed immediately by a sharp tap against a tree\r\nin his rear.\r\n\r\nThe thing happened in the twinkling of an eye, but he recognised the\r\nsound; it was the whiz of a crossbow bolt, which had missed his head,\r\nand buried its point in a fir. The stumble saved him; the bolt would\r\nhave struck his head or chest had not the horse gone nearly on his knee.\r\nThe robber had so planned his ambush that his prey should be well seen,\r\ndistinct in the moonlight, so that his aim might be sure. Recovering\r\nhimself, the horse, without needing the spur, as if he recognised the\r\ndanger to his rider, started forward at full speed, and raced,\r\nregardless of ruts, along the track. Felix, who had hardly got into his\r\nseat again, could for awhile but barely restrain it, so wildly he fled.\r\nHe must have been carried within a few yards of the bandit, but saw\r\nnothing, neither did a second bolt follow him; the crossbow takes time\r\nto bend, and if the robber had companions they were differently armed.\r\n\r\nHe was a furlong or more from the spot before he quite realized the\r\ndanger he had escaped. His bow was unstrung in his hand, his arrows were\r\nall in the quiver; thus, had the bolt struck him, even if the wound had\r\nnot been mortal (as it most likely would have been) he could have made\r\nno resistance. How foolish to disregard the warnings of the grooms at\r\nthe castle! It was now too late; all he could do was to ride. Dreading\r\nevery moment to be thrown, he pushed on as fast as the horse would go.\r\nThere was no pursuit, and after a mile or so, as he left the firs and\r\nentered the ash woods, he slackened somewhat. It was, indeed, necessary,\r\nfor here the hoofs of preceding horsemen had poached the turf (always\r\ndamp under ash) into mud. It was less dark, for the boughs of the ashes\r\ndid not meet above.\r\n\r\nAs he passed, wood-pigeons rose with loud clatterings from their\r\nroosting-places, and once or twice he saw in the gloom the fiery\r\nphosphoric eye-balls of the grey wood-cats. How gladly he recognised\r\npresently the change from trees to bushes, when he rode out from the\r\nthick ashes among the low hawthorns, and knew that he was within a mile\r\nor so of the South Barrier at home! Already he heard the song of the\r\nnightingale, the long note which at night penetrates so far; the\r\nnightingale, which loves the hawthorn and the neighbourhood of man.\r\nImperceptibly he increased the speed again; the horse, too, knew that he\r\nwas nearing home, and responded willingly.\r\n\r\nThe track was much broader and fairly good, but he knew that at one spot\r\nwhere it was marshy it must be cut up. There he went at the side, almost\r\nbrushing a projecting maple bush. Something struck the horse, he fancied\r\nthe rebound of a bough; he jumped, literally jumped, like a buck, and\r\ntore along the road. With one foot out of the stirrup, it was with the\r\nutmost difficulty he stuck to his seat; he was not riding, but holding\r\non for a moment or two. Presently recovering from the jolt, he\r\nendeavoured to check him, but the bit was of no avail; the animal was\r\nbeside himself with terror, and raced headlong till they reached the\r\nbarrier. It was, of course, closed, and the warder was asleep; so that,\r\nuntil he dismounted, and kicked and shouted, no one challenged him.\r\n\r\nThen the warder, spear in hand, appeared with his lantern, but\r\nrecognising the voice, ran to the gate. Within the gate a few yards\r\nthere were the embers of a fire, and round it a bivouac of footmen who\r\nhad been to the feast, and had returned thus far before nightfall.\r\nHearing the noise, some of them arose, and came round him, when one\r\nimmediately exclaimed and asked if he was wounded. Felix replied that he\r\nwas not, but looking at his foot where the man pointed, saw that it was\r\ncovered with blood. But, upon close examination, there was no cut or\r\nincision; he was not hurt. The warder now called to them, and showed a\r\nlong deep scratch on the near flank of the horse, from which the blood\r\nwas dripping.\r\n\r\nIt was such a scratch as might have been made with an iron nail, and,\r\nwithout hesitation, they all put it down to a Bushman's spud. Without\r\ndoubt, the Bushman, hearing Felix approach, had hidden in the maple\r\nbush, and, as he passed, struck with his nail-like dagger; but,\r\nmiscalculating the speed at which the horse was going, instead of\r\npiercing the thigh of the rider, the blow fell on the horse, and the\r\nsharp point was dragged along the side. The horse trembled as they\r\ntouched him.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" said one of the retainers, their headman, \"if you will pardon me,\r\nyou had best string your bow and send a shaft through his heart, for he\r\nwill die in misery before morning.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bushman's spud, the one he uses for assassination or to despatch his\r\nprey, is poisoned. It is a lingering poison, and takes several hours to\r\nproduce its effect; but no remedy is known, and many who have escaped\r\nfrom the cowardly blow have crawled to the path only to expire in\r\ntorture. There was no denying that what the retainer proposed was the\r\nonly thing that could be done. The warder had meantime brought a bucket\r\nof water, of which the poor creature drank eagerly. Felix could not do\r\nit; he could not slay the creature which had carried him so long, and\r\nwhich twice that night had saved him, and was now to die, as it were, in\r\nhis place. He could not consent to it; he led the horse towards home,\r\nbut he was weak or weary, and could not be got beyond the Pen.\r\n\r\nThere the group assembled around him. Felix ordered the scratch to be\r\ncleansed, while he ran over in his mind every possible remedy. He gave\r\nstrict orders that he should not be despatched, and then hastened to the\r\nhouse. He undid with trembling hands the thongs that bound his chest,\r\nand took out his manuscripts, hoping against hope that among the many\r\nnotes he had made there might be something. But there was nothing, or in\r\nhis excitement he overlooked it. Remembering that Oliver was a great\r\nauthority upon horses, he went into his room and tried to wake him.\r\nOliver, weary with his ride, and not as yet having slept off the effects\r\nof the feast, could not be roused.\r\n\r\nFelix left him and hurried back to the Pen. Weary as he was, he watched\r\nby the horse till the larks began to sing and the dawn was at hand. As\r\nyet he had not shown any severe symptoms except twitching of the limbs,\r\nand a constant thirst, which water could not quench. But suddenly he\r\nfell, and the old retainer warned them all to stand away, for he would\r\nbite anything that was near. His words were instantly fulfilled; he\r\nrolled, and kicked, and bit at everything within reach. Seeing this\r\nagony, Felix could no longer delay. He strung his bow, but he could not\r\nfit the arrow to the string, he missed the notch, so much did his hands\r\nshake. He motioned to the retainers who had gathered around, and one of\r\nthem thrust his spear into the horse behind his shoulder.\r\n\r\nWhen Felix at last returned to his chamber he could not but reflect, as\r\nthe sun rose and the beams entered, that every omen had been against\r\nhim; the adder under foot, the bandit's bolt, the Bushman's poisoned\r\npoint. He slept till noon, and, upon going out, unrefreshed and still\r\nweary, he found that they had already buried the horse, and ordered a\r\nmound to be raised above his grave. The day passed slowly; he wandered\r\nabout the castle and the enclosed grounds, seeking comfort and finding\r\nnone. His mind vacillated; he recalled all that Aurora had said,\r\npersuading him not to do anything in haste or despair. Yet he could not\r\ncontinue in his present condition. Another day went by, and still\r\nundecided and doubting, he remained at home.\r\n\r\nOliver began to jest at him; had he abandoned the expedition? Oliver\r\ncould not understand indecision; perhaps he did not see so many sides to\r\nthe question, his mind was always quickly made up. Action was his forte,\r\nnot thought. The night came, and still Felix lingered, hesitating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nSAILING AWAY\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the next morning Felix arose straight from his sleep resolved to\r\ncarry out his plan. Without staying to think a moment, without further\r\nexamination of the various sides of the problem, he started up the\r\ninstant his eyes unclosed, fully determined upon his voyage. The breath\r\nof the bright June morn as he threw open the window-shutter filled him\r\nwith hope; his heart responded to its joyous influence. The excitement\r\nwhich had disturbed his mind had had time to subside. In the still\r\nslumber of the night the strong undercurrent of his thought resumed its\r\ncourse, and he awoke with his will still firmly bent in one direction.\r\n\r\nWhen he had dressed, he took his bow and the chest bound with the\r\nleathern thongs, and went down. It was early, but the Baron had already\r\nfinished breakfast and gone out to his gardens; the Baroness had not yet\r\nappeared. While he was making a hurried breakfast (for having now made\r\nup his mind he was eager to put his resolve into execution), Oliver came\r\nin, and seeing the chest and the bow, understood that the hour had\r\narrived. He immediately said he should accompany him to Heron Bay, and\r\nassist him to start, and went out to order their horses. There were\r\nalways plenty of riding horses at Old House (as at every fortified\r\nmansion), and there was not the least difficulty in getting another for\r\nFelix in place of his old favourite.\r\n\r\nOliver insisted upon taking the wooden chest, which was rather heavy,\r\nbefore him on the saddle, so that Felix had nothing to carry but his\r\nfavourite bow. Oliver was surprised that Felix did not first go to the\r\ngardens and say good-bye to the Baron, or at least knock at the\r\nBaroness's door and bid her farewell. But he made no remark, knowing\r\nFelix's proud and occasionally hard temper. Without a word Felix left\r\nthe old place.\r\n\r\nHe rode forth from the North Barrier, and did not even so much as look\r\nbehind him. Neither he nor Oliver thought of the events that might\r\nhappen before they should again meet in the old familiar house! When the\r\ncircle is once broken up it is often years before it is reformed. Often,\r\nindeed, the members of it never meet again, at least, not in the same\r\nmanner, which, perhaps, they detested then, and ever afterwards\r\nregretted. Without one word of farewell, without a glance, Felix rode\r\nout into the forest.\r\n\r\nThere was not much conversation on the trail to Heron Bay. The serfs\r\nwere still there in charge of the canoe, and were glad enough to see\r\ntheir approach, and thus to be relieved from their lonely watch. They\r\nlaunched the canoe with ease, the provisions were put on board, the\r\nchest lashed to the mast that it might not be lost, the favourite bow\r\nwas also fastened upright to the mast for safety, and simply shaking\r\nhands with Oliver, Felix pushed out into the creek. He paddled the canoe\r\nto the entrance and out into the Lake till he arrived where the\r\nsouth-west breeze, coming over the forest, touched and rippled the\r\nwater, which by the shore was perfectly calm.\r\n\r\nThen, hoisting the sail, he put out the larger paddle which answered as\r\na rudder, took his seat, and, waving his hand to Oliver, began his\r\nvoyage. The wind was but light, and almost too favourable, for he had\r\ndetermined to sail to the eastward; not for any specific reason, but\r\nbecause there the sun rose, and that was the quarter of light and hope.\r\nHis canoe, with a long fore-and-aft sail, and so well adapted for\r\nworking into the wind, was not well rigged for drifting before a breeze,\r\nwhich was what he was now doing. He had merely to keep the canoe before\r\nthe wind, steering so as to clear the bold headland of White Horse which\r\nrose blue from the water's edge far in front of him. Though the wind was\r\nlight, the canoe being so taper and sharp at the prow, and the sail so\r\nlarge in comparison, slipped from the shore faster than he at first\r\nimagined.\r\n\r\nAs he steered aslant from the little bay outwards into the great Lake,\r\nthe ripples rolling before the wind gradually enlarged into wavelets,\r\nthese again increased, and in half an hour, as the wind now played upon\r\nthem over a mile of surface, they seemed in his canoe, with its low\r\nfreeboard, to be considerable waves. He had purposely refrained from\r\nlooking back till now, lest they should think he regretted leaving, and\r\nin his heart desired to return. But now, feeling that he had really\r\nstarted, he glanced behind. He could see no one.\r\n\r\nHe had forgotten that the spot where they had launched the canoe was at\r\nthe end of an inlet, and as he sailed away the creek was shut off from\r\nview by the shore of the Lake. Unable to get to the mouth of the bay\r\nbecause of the underwood and the swampy soil, Oliver had remained gazing\r\nin the direction the canoe had taken for a minute or two, absorbed in\r\nthought (almost the longest period he had ever wasted in such an\r\noccupation), and then with a whistle turned to go. The serfs,\r\nunderstanding that they were no longer required, gathered their things\r\ntogether, and were shortly on their way home. Oliver, holding Felix's\r\nhorse by the bridle, had already ridden that way, but he presently\r\nhalted, and waited till the three men overtook him. He then gave the\r\nhorse into their charge, and turning to the right, along a forest path\r\nwhich branched off there, went to Ponze. Felix could therefore see no\r\none when he looked back, and they were indeed already on their way from\r\nthe place.\r\n\r\nHe now felt that he was alone. He had parted from the shore, and from\r\nall the old associations; he was fast passing not only out upon the\r\nwater, but out into the unknown future. But his spirit no longer\r\nvacillated; now that he was really in the beginning of his long\r\ncontemplated enterprise his natural strength of mind returned. The\r\nweakness and irresolution, the hesitation, left him. He became full of\r\nhis adventure, and thought of nothing else.\r\n\r\nThe south-west breeze, blowing as a man breathes, with alternate rise\r\nand fall, now driving him along rapidly till the water bubbled under the\r\nprow, now sinking, came over his right shoulder and cooled his cheek,\r\nfor it was now noon, and the June sun was unchecked by clouds. He could\r\nno longer distinguish the shape of the trees on shore; all the boughs\r\nwere blended together in one great wood, stretching as far as he could\r\nsee. On his left there was a chain of islands, some covered with firs,\r\nand others only with brushwood, while others again were so low and flat\r\nthat the waves in stormy weather broke almost over them.\r\n\r\nAs he drew near White Horse, five white terns, or sea-swallows, flew\r\nover; he did not welcome their appearance, as they usually preceded\r\nrough gales. The headland, wooded to its ridge, now rose high against\r\nthe sky; ash and nut-tree and hawthorn had concealed the ancient graven\r\nfigure of the horse upon its side, but the tradition was not forgotten,\r\nand the site retained its name. He had been steering so as just to clear\r\nthe promontory, but he now remembered that when he had visited the\r\nsummit of the hill, he had observed that banks and shoals extended far\r\nout from the shore, and were nearly on a level with the surface of the\r\nLake. In a calm they were visible, but waves concealed them, and unless\r\nthe helmsman recognised the swirl sufficiently early to change his\r\ncourse, they were extremely dangerous.\r\n\r\nFelix bore more out from the land, and passing fully a mile to the\r\nnorth, left the shoals on his right. On his other hand there was a sandy\r\nand barren island barely a quarter of a mile distant, upon which he\r\nthought he saw the timbers of a wreck. It was quite probable, for the\r\nisland lay in the track of vessels coasting along the shore. Beyond\r\nWhite Horse, the land fell away in a series of indentations, curving\r\ninwards to the south; an inhospitable coast, for the hills came down to\r\nthe strand, ending abruptly in low, but steep, chalk cliffs. Many\r\nislands of large size stood out on the left, but Felix, not knowing the\r\nshape of the Lake beyond White Horse, thought it best to follow the\r\ntrend of the land. He thus found, after about three hours, that he had\r\ngone far out of his course, for the gulf-like curve of the coast now\r\nbegan to return to the northward, and looking in that direction he saw a\r\nmerchant vessel under her one square sail of great size, standing across\r\nthe bay.\r\n\r\nShe was about five miles distant, and was evidently steering so as to\r\nkeep just inside the line of the islands. Felix, with some difficulty,\r\nsteered in a direction to interrupt her. The south-west wind being then\r\nimmediately aft, his sail did not answer well; presently he lowered it,\r\nand paddled till he had turned the course so that the outrigger was now\r\non the eastern side. Then hoisting the sail again, he sat at what had\r\nbefore been the prow, and steered a point or so nearer the wind. This\r\nimproved her sailing, but as the merchant ship had at least five miles\r\nstart, it would take some hours to overtake her. Nor on reflection was\r\nhe at all anxious to come up with her, for mariners were dreaded for\r\ntheir lawless conduct, being, when on a voyage, beyond all jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, if they saw an opportunity, they did not hesitate to\r\nland and pillage a house, or even a hamlet. On the other, those who\r\ndwelt anywhere near the shore considered it good sport to light a fire\r\nand lure a vessel to her destruction, or if she was becalmed to sally\r\nout in boats, attack, and perhaps destroy both ship and crew. Hence the\r\nmany wrecks, and losses, and the risks of navigation, not so much from\r\nnatural obstacles, since the innumerable islands, and the creeks and\r\ninlets of the mainland almost always offered shelter, no matter which\r\nway the storm blew, but from the animosity of the coast people. If there\r\nwas an important harbour and a town where provisions could be obtained,\r\nor repairs effected, the right of entrance was jealously guarded, and no\r\nship, however pressed by the gale, was permitted to leave, if she had\r\nanchored, without payment of a fine. So that vessels as much as possible\r\navoided the harbours and towns, and the mainland altogether, sailing\r\nalong beside the islands, which were, for the most part, uninhabited,\r\nand anchoring under their lee at night.\r\n\r\nFelix, remembering the character of the mariners, resolved to keep well\r\naway from them, but to watch their course as a guide to himself. The\r\nmainland now ran abruptly to the north, and the canoe, as he brought her\r\nmore into the wind, sprang forward at a rapid pace. The outrigger\r\nprevented her from making any leeway, or heeling over, and the large\r\nspread of sail forced her swiftly through the water. He had lost sight\r\nof the ship behind some islands, and as he approached these, began to\r\nask himself if he had not better haul down his sail there, as he must\r\nnow be getting near her, when to his surprise, on coming close, he saw\r\nher great square sail in the middle, as it seemed, of the land. The\r\nshore there was flat, the hills which had hitherto bounded it suddenly\r\nceasing; it was overgrown with reeds and flags, and about two miles away\r\nthe dark sail of the merchantman drifted over these, the hull being\r\nhidden. He at once knew that he had reached the western mouth of the\r\nstraits which divide the southern and northern mainland. When he went to\r\nsee the channel on foot through the forest, he must have struck it a\r\nmile or two more to the east, where it wound under the hills.\r\n\r\nIn another half hour he arrived at the opening of the strait; it was\r\nabout a mile wide, and either shore was quite flat, that on the right\r\nfor a short distance, the range of downs approaching within two miles;\r\nthat on the left, or north, was level as far as he could see. He had now\r\nagain to lower his sail, to get the outrigger on his lee as he turned to\r\nthe right and steered due east into the channel. So long as the shore\r\nwas level, he had no difficulty, for the wind drew over it, but when the\r\nhills gradually came near and almost overhung the channel, they shut off\r\nmuch of the breeze, and his progress was slow. When it turned and ran\r\nnarrowing every moment to the south, the wind failed him altogether.\r\n\r\nOn the right shore, wooded hills rose from the water like a wall; on the\r\nleft, it was a perfect plain. He could see nothing of the merchantman,\r\nalthough he knew that she could not sail here, but must be working\r\nthrough with her sweeps. Her heavy hull and bluff bow must make the\r\nrowing a slow and laborious process; therefore she could not be far\r\nahead, but was concealed by the winding of the strait. He lowered the\r\nsail, as it was now useless, and began to paddle; in a very short time\r\nhe found the heat under the hills oppressive when thus working. He had\r\nnow been afloat between six and seven hours, and must have come fully\r\nthirty miles, perhaps rather more than twenty in a straight line, and he\r\nfelt somewhat weary and cramped from sitting so long in the canoe.\r\n\r\nThough he paddled hard he did not seem to make much progress, and at\r\nlength he recognised that there was a distinct current, which opposed\r\nhis advance, flowing through the channel from east to west. If he ceased\r\npaddling, he found he drifted slowly back; the long aquatic weeds, too,\r\nwhich he passed, all extended their floating streamers westward. We did\r\nnot know of this current till Felix Aquila observed and recorded it.\r\n\r\nTired and hungry (for, full of his voyage, he had taken no refreshments\r\nsince he started), he resolved to land, rest a little while, and then\r\nascend the hill, and see what he could of the channel. He soon reached\r\nthe shore, the strait having narrowed to less than a mile in width, and\r\nran the canoe on the ground by a bush, to which, on getting out, he\r\nattached the painter. The relief of stretching his limbs was so great\r\nthat it seemed to endow him with fresh strength, and without waiting to\r\neat, he at once climbed the hill. From the top, the remainder of the\r\nstrait could be easily distinguished. But a short distance from where he\r\nstood, it bent again, and proceeded due east.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE STRAITS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe passage contracted there to little over half a mile, but these\r\nnarrows did not continue far; the shores, having approached thus near\r\neach other, quickly receded, till presently they were at least two miles\r\napart. The merchant vessel had passed the narrows with the aid of her\r\nsweeps, but she moved slowly, and, as it seemed to him, with difficulty.\r\nShe was about a mile and a half distant, and near the eastern mouth of\r\nthe strait. As Felix watched he saw her square sail again raised,\r\nshowing that she had reached a spot where the hills ceased to shut off\r\nthe wind. Entering the open Lake she altered her course and sailed away\r\nto the north-north-east, following the course of the northern mainland.\r\n\r\nLooking now eastwards, across the Lake, he saw a vast and beautiful\r\nexpanse of water, without island or break of any kind, reaching to the\r\nhorizon. Northwards and southwards the land fell rapidly away, skirted\r\nas usual with islets and shoals, between which and the shore vessels\r\nusually voyaged. He had heard of this open water, and it was his\r\nintention to sail out into and explore it, but as the sun now began to\r\ndecline towards the west, he considered that he had better wait till\r\nmorning, and so have a whole day before him. Meantime, he would paddle\r\nthrough the channel, beach the canoe on the islet that stood farthest\r\nout, and so start clear on the morrow.\r\n\r\nTurning now to look back the other way, westward, he was surprised to\r\nsee a second channel, which came almost to the foot of the hill on which\r\nhe stood, but there ended and did not connect with the first. The\r\nentrance to it was concealed, as he now saw, by an island, past which he\r\nmust have sailed that afternoon. This second or blind channel seemed\r\nmore familiar to him than the flat and reedy shore at the mouth of the\r\ntrue strait, and he now recognised it as the one to which he had\r\njourneyed on foot through the forest. He had not then struck the true\r\nstrait at all; he had sat down and pondered beside this deceptive inlet\r\nthinking that it divided the mainlands. From this discovery he saw how\r\neasy it was to be misled in such matters.\r\n\r\nBut it even more fully convinced him of the importance of this\r\nuninhabited and neglected place. It seemed like a canal cut on purpose\r\nto supply a fort from the Lake in the rear with provisions and material,\r\nsupposing access in front prevented by hostile fleets and armies. A\r\ncastle, if built near where he stood, would command the channel; arrows,\r\nindeed, could not be shot across, but vessels under the protection of\r\nthe castle could dispute the passage, obstructed as it could be with\r\nfloating booms. An invader coming from the north must cross here; for\r\nmany years past there had been a general feeling that some day such an\r\nattempt would be made. Fortifications would be of incalculable value in\r\nrepelling the hostile hordes and preventing their landing.\r\n\r\nWho held this strait would possess the key of the Lake, and would be\r\nmaster of, or would at least hold the balance between, the kings and\r\nrepublics dotted along the coasts on either hand. No vessel could pass\r\nwithout his permission. It was the most patent illustration of the\r\nextremely local horizon, the contracted mental view of the petty kings\r\nand their statesmen, who were so concerned about the frontiers of their\r\nprovinces, and frequently interfered and fought for a single palisaded\r\nestate or barony, yet were quite oblivious of the opportunity of empire\r\nopen here to any who could seize it.\r\n\r\nIf the governor of such a castle as he imagined built upon the strait,\r\nhad also vessels of war, they could lie in this second channel sheltered\r\nfrom all winds, and ready to sally forth and take an attacking force\r\nupon the flank. While he pondered upon these advantages he could not\r\nconceal from himself that he had once sat down and dreamed beside this\r\nsecond inlet, thinking it to be the channel. The doubt arose whether, if\r\nhe was so easily misled in such a large, tangible, and purely physical\r\nmatter, he might not be deceived also in his ideas; whether, if tested,\r\nthey might not fail; whether the world was not right and he wrong.\r\n\r\nThe very clearness and many-sided character of his mind often hindered\r\nand even checked altogether the best founded of his impressions, the\r\nmore especially when he, as it were, stood still and thought. In\r\nreverie, the subtlety of his mind entangled him; in action, he was\r\nalmost always right. Action prompted his decision. Descending from the\r\nhill he now took some refreshment, and then pushed out again in the\r\ncanoe. So powerful was the current in the narrowest part of the strait\r\nthat it occupied him two hours in paddling as many miles.\r\n\r\nWhen he was free of the channel, he hoisted sail and directed his course\r\nstraight out for an island which stood almost opposite the entrance. But\r\nas he approached, driven along at a good pace, suddenly the canoe seemed\r\nto be seized from beneath. He knew in a moment that he had grounded on\r\nsoft mud, and sprang up to lower the sail, but before he could do so the\r\ncanoe came to a standstill on the mud-bank, and the waves following\r\nbehind, directly she stopped, broke over the stern. Fortunately they\r\nwere but small, having only a mile or so to roll from the shore, but\r\nthey flung enough water on board in a few minutes to spoil part of his\r\nprovisions, and to set everything afloat that was loose on the bottom of\r\nthe vessel.\r\n\r\nHe was apprehensive lest she should fill, for he now perceived that he\r\nhad forgotten to provide anything with which to bale her out. Something\r\nis always forgotten. Having got the sail down (lest the wind should snap\r\nthe mast), he tried hard to force the canoe back with his longer paddle,\r\nused as a movable rudder. His weight and the resistance of the adhesive\r\nmud, on which she had driven with much force was too great; he could not\r\nshove her off. When he pushed, the paddle sank into the soft bottom, and\r\ngave him nothing to press against. After struggling for some time, he\r\npaused, beginning to fear that his voyage had already reached an end.\r\n\r\nA minute's thought, more potent than the strength of ten men, showed him\r\nthat the canoe required lightening. There was no cargo to throw\r\noverboard, nor ballast. He was the only weight. He immediately\r\nundressed, and let himself overboard at the prow, retaining hold of the\r\nstem. His feet sank deep into the ooze; he felt as if, had he let go, he\r\nshould have gradually gone down into this quicksand of fine mud. By\r\nrapidly moving his feet he managed, however, to push the canoe; she rose\r\nconsiderably so soon as he was out of her, and, although he had hold of\r\nthe prow, still his body was lighter in the water. Pushing, struggling,\r\nand pressing forward, he, by sheer impact, as it were, for his feet\r\nfound no hold in the mud, forced her back by slow degrees.\r\n\r\nThe blows of the waves drove her forward almost as much as he pushed her\r\nback. Still, in time, and when his strength was fast decreasing, she did\r\nmove, and he had the satisfaction of feeling the water deeper beneath\r\nhim. But when he endeavoured to pull himself into the canoe over the\r\nprow, directly his motive power ceased, the waves undid the advance he\r\nhad achieved, and he had to resume his labour. This time, thinking\r\nagain, before he attempted to get into the canoe he turned her sideways\r\nto the wind, with the outrigger to leeward. When her sharp prow and\r\nrounded keel struck the mud-bank end on she ran easily along it. But,\r\nturned sideways, her length found more resistance, and though the waves\r\nsent her some way upon it, she soon came to a standstill. He clambered\r\nin as quickly as he could (it is not easy to get into a boat out of the\r\nwater, the body feels so heavy), and, taking the paddle, without waiting\r\nto dress, worked away from the spot.\r\n\r\nNot till he had got some quarter of a mile back towards the mainland did\r\nhe pause to dry himself and resume part of his clothing; the canoe being\r\nstill partly full of water, it was no use to put on all. Resting awhile\r\nafter his severe exertions, he looked back, and now supposed, from the\r\ncolour of the water and the general indications, that these shallows\r\nextended a long distance, surrounding the islands at the mouth of the\r\nchannel, so that no vessel could enter or pass out in a direct line, but\r\nmust steer to the north or south until the obstacle was rounded. Afraid\r\nto attempt to land on another island, his only course, as the sun was\r\nnow going down, was to return to the mainland, which he reached without\r\nmuch trouble, as the current favoured him.\r\n\r\nHe drew the canoe upon the ground as far as he could. It was not a good\r\nplace to land, as the bottom was chalk, washed into holes by the waves,\r\nand studded with angular flints. As the wind was off the shore it did\r\nnot matter; if it had blown from the east, his canoe might very likely\r\nhave been much damaged. The shore was overgrown with hazel to within\r\ntwenty yards of the water, then the ground rose and was clothed with low\r\nash-trees, whose boughs seemed much stunted by tempest, showing how\r\nexposed the spot was to the easterly gales of spring. The south-west\r\nwind was shut off by the hills beyond. Felix was so weary that for some\r\ntime he did nothing save rest upon the ground, which was but scantily\r\ncovered with grass. An hour's rest, however, restored him to himself.\r\n\r\nHe gathered some dry sticks (there were plenty under the ashes), struck\r\nhis flint against the steel, ignited the tinder, and soon had a fire. It\r\nwas not necessary for warmth, the June evening was soft and warm, but it\r\nwas the hunter's instinct. Upon camping for the night the hunter, unless\r\nBushmen are suspected to be in the neighbourhood, invariably lights a\r\nfire, first to cook his supper, and secondly, and often principally, to\r\nmake the spot his home. The hearth is home, whether there be walls round\r\nit or not. Directly there are glowing embers the place is no longer\r\nwild, it becomes human. Felix had nothing that needed cooking. He took\r\nhis cowhide from the canoe and spread it on the ground.\r\n\r\nA well-seasoned cowhide is the first possession of every hunter; it\r\nkeeps him from the damp; and with a second, supported on three short\r\npoles stuck in the earth (two crossed at the top in front, forming a\r\nfork, and fastened with a thong, the third resting on these), he\r\nprotects himself from the heaviest rain. This little tent is always\r\nbuilt with the back to windward. Felix did not erect a second hide, the\r\nevening was so warm and beautiful he did not need it, his cloak would be\r\nample for covering. The fire crackled and blazed at intervals, just far\r\nenough from him that he might feel no inconvenience from its heat.\r\n\r\nThrushes sang in the ash wood all around him, the cuckoo called, and the\r\nchiff-chaff never ceased for a moment. Before him stretched the expanse\r\nof waters; he could even here see over the low islands. In the sky a\r\nstreak of cloud was tinted by the sunset, slowly becoming paler as the\r\nlight departed. He reclined in that idle, thoughtless state which\r\nsucceeds unusual effort, till the deepening shadow and the sinking fire,\r\nand the appearance of a star, warned him that the night was really here.\r\nThen he arose, threw on more fuel, and fetched his cloak, his chest, and\r\nhis boar spear from the canoe. The chest he covered with a corner of the\r\nhide, wrapped himself in the cloak, bringing it well over his face on\r\naccount of the dew; then, drawing the lower corners of the hide over his\r\nfeet and limbs, he stretched himself at full length and fell asleep,\r\nwith the spear beside him.\r\n\r\nThere was the possibility of Bushmen, but not much probability. There\r\nwould be far more danger near the forest path, where they might expect a\r\ntraveller and watch to waylay him, but they could not tell beforehand\r\nwhere he would rest that night. If any had seen the movements of his\r\ncanoe, if any lighted upon his bivouac by chance, his fate was certain.\r\nHe knew this, but trusted to the extreme improbability of Bushmen\r\nfrequenting a place where there was nothing to plunder. Besides, he had\r\nno choice, as he could not reach the islands. If there was risk, it was\r\nforgotten in the extremity of his weariness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nSAILING ONWARDS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Felix awoke, he knew at once by the height of the sun that the\r\nmorning was far advanced. Throwing off his cloak, he stood up, but\r\nimmediately crouched down again, for a vessel was passing but a short\r\ndistance from the shore, and nearly opposite his encampment. She had two\r\nmasts, and from the flags flying, the numerous bannerets, and the\r\nmovements of so many men on board, he knew her to be a ship of war. He\r\nwas anxious that he should not be seen, and regretted that his canoe was\r\nso much exposed, for the bush by which he had landed hid it only from\r\none side. As the shore was so bare and open, if they looked that way the\r\nmen on board would hardly fail to see it, and might even distinguish\r\nhim. But whether they were too much engaged with their own affairs, or\r\nkept a careless look-out, no notice appeared to be taken, no boat was\r\nlowered.\r\n\r\nHe watched the war-ship for nearly an hour before he ventured to move.\r\nHer course was to the eastward, inside the fringe of islands. That she\r\nwas neither Irish nor Welsh he was certain from her build and from her\r\nflags; they were too distant for the exact designs upon them to be seen,\r\nbut near enough for him to know that they were not those displayed by\r\nthe foreigners. She sailed fast, having the wind nearly aft, which\r\nsuited her two square sails.\r\n\r\nThe wind had risen high during the night, and now blew almost a gale, so\r\nthat he saw he must abandon for the present his project of sailing out\r\nupon the open water. The waves there would be too high for his canoe,\r\nwhich floated low in the water, and had but about six inches freeboard.\r\nThey would wash over and possibly swamp her. Only two courses were open\r\nto him: either to sail inside the islands under shelter of the land, or\r\nto remain where he was till the breeze moderated. If he sailed inside\r\nthe islands, following the northward course of the merchant vessel he\r\nhad observed the previous evening, that would carry him past Eaststock,\r\nthe eastern port of Sypolis, which city, itself inland, had two\r\nharbours, with the western of which (Weststock) it had communication by\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nShould he continue to sail on, he would soon reach that part of the\r\nnorthern continent which was occupied by the Irish outposts. On the\r\nother hand, to follow the war-ship, east by south, would, he knew, bring\r\nhim by the great city of Aisi, famous for its commerce, its riches, and\r\nthe warlike disposition of its king, Isembard. He was the acknowledged\r\nhead of the forces of the League; but yet, with the inconsistency of the\r\nage, sometimes attacked other members of it. His furious energy was\r\nalways disturbing the world, and Felix had no doubt he was now at war\r\nwith some one or other, and that the war-ship he had seen was on its way\r\nto assist him or his enemies. One of the possibilities which had\r\nimpelled him to this voyage was that of taking service with some king or\r\ncommander, and so perhaps gradually rising himself to command.\r\n\r\nSuch adventures were very common, knights often setting forth upon such\r\nexpeditions when dissatisfied with their own rulers, and they were\r\nusually much welcomed as an addition to the strength of the camp they\r\nsought. But there was this difference: that such knights carried with\r\nthem some substantial recommendation, either numerous retainers well\r\narmed and accustomed to battle, considerable treasure, or at least a\r\nreputation for prowess in the field. Felix had nothing to offer, and for\r\nnothing nothing is given.\r\n\r\nThe world does not recognise intrinsic worth, or potential genius.\r\nGenius must accomplish some solid result before it is applauded and\r\nreceived. The unknown architect may say: \"I have a design in my mind for\r\nan impregnable castle.\" But the world cannot see or appreciate the mere\r\ndesign. If by any personal sacrifice of time, dignity, or self-respect\r\nthe architect, after long years, can persuade someone to permit him to\r\nbuild the castle, to put his design into solid stone which squadrons may\r\nknock their heads against in vain, then he is acknowledged. There is\r\nthen a tangible result.\r\n\r\nFelix was in the position of the architect. He believed he had ideas,\r\nbut he had nothing substantial, no result, to point to. He had therefore\r\nbut little hope of success, and his natural hauteur and pride revolted\r\nagainst making application for enrolment which must be accompanied with\r\nmuch personal humiliation, since at best he could but begin in the\r\ncommon ranks. The very idea of asking was repugnant to him. The thought\r\nof Aurora, however, drew him on.\r\n\r\nThe pride was false, he said to himself, and arose from too high an\r\nestimate of his abilities; or it was the consequence of living so long\r\nentirely secluded from the world. He acknowledged to himself that he had\r\nnot been beaten down to his level. Full of devotion to Aurora, he\r\nresolved to humble himself, to seek the humblest service in King\r\nIsembard's camp, to bow his spirit to the orders of men above him in\r\nrank but below him in birth and ability, to submit to the numberless\r\nindignities of a common soldier's life.\r\n\r\nHe proceeded to launch the canoe, and had already placed the chest on\r\nboard when it occurred to him that the difficulties he had encountered\r\nthe previous evening, when his canoe was so nearly lost, arose from his\r\nignorance of the channels. It would be advisable to ascend the hill, and\r\ncarefully survey the coast as far as possible before setting forth. He\r\ndid so. The war-ship was still visible from the summit, but while he\r\nlooked she was hidden by the intervening islands. The white foam and\r\nangry appearance of the distant open water direct to the eastward,\r\nshowed how wise he had been not to attempt its exploration. Under the\r\nland the wind was steady; yonder, where the gale struck the surface with\r\nall its force, the waves were large and powerful.\r\n\r\nFrom this spot he could see nearly the whole length of the strait, and,\r\ngazing up it in the direction he had come, he saw some boats crossing in\r\nthe distance. As they moved so slowly, and appeared so broad, he\r\nconjectured that they were flat-bottomed punts, and, straining his eyes,\r\nhe fancied he detected horses on board. He watched four cross, and\r\npresently the first punt returned, as if for another freight. He now\r\nnoticed that there was a land route by which travellers or waggons came\r\ndown from the northward, and crossed the strait by a ferry. It appeared\r\nthat the ferry was not in the narrowest part of the strait, but nearer\r\nits western mouth, where the shores were flat, and covered with reeds\r\nand flags. He wondered that he had not seen anything of the\r\nlanding-places, or of the ferry-boats, or some sign of this traffic when\r\nhe passed, but concluded that the track was hidden among the dense\r\ngrowth of reed and flag, and that the punts, not being in use that day,\r\nhad been drawn up, and perhaps covered with green boughs to shelter them\r\nfrom the heat of the summer sun.\r\n\r\nThe fact of this route existing, however, gave additional importance to\r\nthe establishment of a fort on the shore of the strait, as he had so\r\nlong contemplated. By now, the first punt had obtained another load, and\r\nwas re-crossing the channel. It was evident that a caravan of travellers\r\nor merchants had arrived, such persons usually travelling in large\r\nbodies for safety, so that the routes were often deserted for weeks\r\ntogether, and then suddenly covered with people. Routes, indeed, they\r\nwere, and not roads; mere tracks worn through the forest and over the\r\nhills, often impassable from floods.\r\n\r\nStill further satisfied that his original idea of a castle here was\r\nfounded on a correct estimate of the value of the spot, Felix resolved\r\nto keep the conception to himself, and not again to hazard it to others,\r\nwho might despise him, but adopt his design. With one long last glance\r\nat the narrow streak of water which formed the central part, as it were,\r\nof his many plans, he descended the hill, and pushed off in the canoe.\r\n\r\nHis course this time gave him much less trouble than the day before,\r\nwhen he had frequently to change his tack. The steady, strong breeze\r\ncame off the land, to which he was too close for any waves to arise, and\r\nhour after hour passed without any necessity to shift the sail, further\r\nthan to ease or tighten the sheets as the course of the land varied. By\r\ndegrees the wind came more and more across his course, at right angles\r\nto it, and then began to fall aft as he described an arc, and the land\r\nprojected northwards.\r\n\r\nHe saw several small villages on the shore, and passed one narrow bay,\r\nwhich seemed, indeed, to penetrate into the land deeper than he could\r\nactually see. Suddenly, after four or five hours, sailing, he saw the\r\ntower of a church over the wooded hills. This he knew must indicate the\r\nposition of Aisi. The question now came, whether he should sail into the\r\nharbour, when he would, of course, at once be seen, and have to undergo\r\nthe examination of the officers; or should he land, and go on foot to\r\nthe city? A minute's reflection assured him the latter was the better\r\nplan, for his canoe was of so unusual a construction, that it would be\r\nmore than carefully examined, and not unlikely his little treasures\r\nwould be discovered and appropriated. Without hesitation, therefore, and\r\ncongratulating himself that there were no vessels in sight, he ran the\r\ncanoe on shore among the flags and reeds which bordered it.\r\n\r\nHe drew her up as far as his strength permitted, and not only took down\r\nthe sail, but unshipped the mast; then cutting a quantity of dead reeds,\r\nhe scattered them over her, so that, unless a boat passed very close to\r\nthe land, she would not be seen. While he had a meal he considered how\r\nhe had better proceed. The only arms with which he excelled were the bow\r\nand arrow; clearly, therefore, if he wished an engagement, he should\r\ntake these with him, and exhibit his skill. But well he knew the utter\r\nabsence of law and justice except for the powerful. His bow, which he so\r\ngreatly valued, and which was so well seasoned, and could be relied\r\nupon, might be taken from him.\r\n\r\nHis arrows, so carefully prepared from chosen wood, and pointed with\r\nsteel, might be seized. Both bow and arrows were far superior to those\r\nused by the hunters and soldiery, and he dreaded losing them. There was\r\nhis crossbow, but it was weak, and intended for killing only small game,\r\nas birds, and at short range. He could make no display with that. Sword\r\nhe had none for defence; there remained only his boar spear, and with\r\nthis he resolved to be content, trusting to obtain the loan of a bow\r\nwhen the time came to display his skill, and that fortune would enable\r\nhim to triumph with an inferior weapon.\r\n\r\nAfter resting awhile and stretching his limbs, cramped in the canoe, he\r\nset out (carrying his boar-spear only) along the shore, for the thick\r\ngrowth of the firs would not let him penetrate in the direction he had\r\nseen the tower. He had to force his way through the reeds and flags and\r\nbrushwood, which flourished between the firs and the water's edge. It\r\nwas hard work walking, or rather pushing through these obstacles, and he\r\nrejoiced when he emerged upon the slope of a down where there was an\r\nopen sward, and but a few scattered groups of firs. The fact of it being\r\nopen, and the shortness of the sward, showed at once that it was used\r\nfor grazing purposes for cattle and sheep. Here he could walk freely,\r\nand soon reached the top. Thence the city was visible almost underneath\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIt stood at the base of a low narrow promontory, which ran a long way\r\ninto the Lake. The narrow bank, near where it joined the mainland, was\r\npenetrated by a channel or creek, about a hundred yards wide, or less,\r\nwhich channel appeared to enter the land and was lost from sight of\r\namong the trees. Beyond this channel a river ran into the lake, and in\r\nthe Y, between the creek and the river, the city had been built.\r\n\r\nIt was surrounded with a brick wall, and there were two large round\r\nbrick towers on the land side, which indicated the position of the\r\ncastle and palace. The space enclosed by the walls was not more than\r\nhalf a mile square, and the houses did not occupy nearly all of it.\r\nThere were open places, gardens, and even small paddocks among them.\r\nNone of the houses were more than two storeys high, but what at once\r\nstruck a stranger was the fact that they were all roofed with red tiles,\r\nmost of the houses of that day being thatched or covered with shingles\r\nof wood. As Felix afterwards learnt, this had been effected during the\r\nreign of the present king, whose object was to protect his city from\r\nbeing set on fire by burning arrows. The encircling wall had become a\r\ndull red hue from the long exposure to the weather, but the roofs were a\r\nbrighter red. There was no ensign flying on either of the towers, from\r\nwhich he concluded that the king at that moment was absent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE CITY\r\n\r\n\r\nSlowly descending towards the city, Felix looked in vain for any means\r\nof crossing the channel or creek, which extended upon the side of it,\r\nand in which he counted twenty-two merchant vessels at anchor, or moored\r\nto the bank, besides a number of smaller craft and boats. The ship of\r\nwar, which had arrived before him, was beached close up by a gate of the\r\ncity, which opened on the creek or port, and her crew were busily\r\nengaged discharging her stores. As he walked beside the creek trying to\r\ncall the attention of some boatman to take him across, he was impressed\r\nby the silence, for though the city wall was not much more than a\r\nstone's throw distant, there was none of the usual hum which arises from\r\nthe movements of people. On looking closer he noticed, too, that there\r\nwere few persons on the merchant vessels, and not one gang at work\r\nloading or unloading. Except the warder stalking to and fro on the wall,\r\nand the crew of the war-ship, there was no one visible. As the warder\r\npaced to and fro the blade of his partisan gleamed in the sunshine. He\r\nmust have seen Felix, but with military indifference did not pay the\r\nslightest heed to the latter's efforts to attract his attention.\r\n\r\nHe now passed the war-ship, and shouted to the men at work, who were, he\r\ncould see, carrying sheaves of arrows and bundles of javelins from the\r\nvessel and placing them on carts; but they did not trouble to reply. His\r\ncommon dress and ordinary appearance did not inspire them with any hope\r\nof payment from him if they obliged him with a boat. The utter\r\nindifference with which his approach was seen showed him the contempt in\r\nwhich he was held.\r\n\r\nLooking round to see if there were no bridge or ferry, he caught sight\r\nof the grey church tower which he had observed from afar while sailing.\r\nIt was quite a mile from the city, and isolated outside the walls. It\r\nstood on the slope of the hill, over whose summit the tower was visible.\r\nHe wandered up towards it, as there were usually people in or about the\r\nchurches, which were always open day and night. If no one else, the\r\nporter in the lodge at the church door would be there, for he or his\r\nrepresentative never left it, being always on the watch lest some thief\r\nshould attempt to enter the treasury, or steal the sacred vessels.\r\n\r\nBut as he ascended the hill he met a shepherd, whose dogs prepared to\r\nfly at him, recognising a stranger. For a moment the man seemed inclined\r\nto let them wreak their will, if they could, for he also felt inclined\r\nto challenge a stranger, but, seeing Felix lower his spear, it probably\r\noccurred to him that some of his dogs would be killed. He therefore\r\nordered them down, and stayed to listen. Felix learnt that there was no\r\nbridge across the creek, and only one over the river; but there was a\r\nferry for anybody who was known. No strangers were allowed to cross the\r\nferry; they must enter by the main road over the bridge.\r\n\r\n\"But how am I to get into the place then?\" said Felix. The shepherd\r\nshook his head, and said he could not tell him, and walked away about\r\nhis business.\r\n\r\nDiscouraged at these trifling vexations, which seemed to cross his path\r\nat every step, Felix found his way to the ferry, but, as the shepherd\r\nhad said, the boatman refused to carry him, being a stranger. No\r\npersuasion could move him; nor the offer of a small silver coin, worth\r\nabout ten times his fare.\r\n\r\n\"I must then swim across,\" said Felix, preparing to take off his\r\nclothes.\r\n\r\n\"Swim, if you like,\" said the boatman, with a grim smile; \"but you will\r\nnever land.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because the warder will let drive at you with an arrow.\"\r\n\r\nFelix looked, and saw that he was opposite the extreme angle of the city\r\nwall, a point usually guarded with care. There was a warder stalking to\r\nand fro; he carried a partisan, but, of course, might have his bow\r\nwithin reach, or could probably call to the soldiers of the guard.\r\n\r\n\"This _is_ annoying,\" said Felix, ready to give up his enterprise. \"How\r\never can I get into the city?\"\r\n\r\nThe old boatman grinned, but said nothing, and returned to a net which\r\nhe was mending. He made no answer to the further questions Felix put to\r\nhim. Felix then shouted to the warder; the soldier looked once, but paid\r\nno more heed. Felix walked a little way and sat down on the grass. He\r\nwas deeply discouraged. These repulses, trifles in themselves, assumed\r\nan importance, because his mind had long been strung up to a high pitch\r\nof tension. A stolid man would have thought nothing of them. After a\r\nwhile he arose, again asking himself how should he become a leader, who\r\nhad not the perseverance to enter a city in peaceful guise?\r\n\r\nNot knowing what else to do, he followed the creek round the foot of the\r\nhill, and so onwards for a mile or more. This bank was steep, on account\r\nof the down; the other cultivated, the corn being already high. The\r\ncuckoo sang (she loves the near neighbourhood of man) and flew over the\r\nchannel towards a little copse. Almost suddenly the creek wound round\r\nunder a low chalk cliff, and in a moment Felix found himself confronted\r\nby another city. This had no wall; it was merely defended by a ditch and\r\nearthwork, without tower or bastion.\r\n\r\nThe houses were placed thickly together; there were, he thought, six or\r\nseven times as many as he had previously seen, and they were thatched or\r\nshingled, like those in his own country. It stood in the midst of the\r\nfields, and the corn came up to the fosse; there were many people at\r\nwork, but, as he noticed, most of them were old men, bowed and feeble. A\r\nlittle way farther he saw a second boathouse; he hastened thither, and\r\nthe ferrywoman, for the boat was poled across by a stout dame, made not\r\nthe least difficulty about ferrying him over. So delighted was Felix at\r\nthis unexpected fortune, that he gave her the small silver coin, at\r\nsight of which he instantly rose high in her estimation.\r\n\r\nShe explained to him, in answer to his inquiries, that this was also\r\ncalled Aisi; this was the city of the common folk. Those who were rich\r\nor powerful had houses in the walled city, the precinct of the Court.\r\nMany of the houses there, too, were the inns of great families who dwelt\r\nin the country in their castles, but when they came to the Court\r\nrequired a house. Their shields, or coats of arms, were painted over the\r\ndoors. The walled city was guarded with such care, because so many\r\nattempts had been made to surprise it, and to assassinate the king,\r\nwhose fiery disposition and constant wars had raised him up so many\r\nenemies. As much care was taken to prevent a single stranger entering as\r\nif he were the vanguard of a hostile army, and if he now went back (as\r\nhe could do) to the bridge over the river, he would be stopped and\r\nquestioned, and possibly confined in prison till the king returned.\r\n\r\n\"Where is the king?\" asked Felix; \"I came to try and take service with\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you will be welcome,\" said the woman. \"He is in the field, and has\r\njust sat down before Iwis.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was why the walled city seemed so empty, then.\" said Felix.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; all the people are with him; there will be a great battle this\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n\"How far is it to Iwis?\" said Felix.\r\n\r\n\"Twenty-seven miles,\" replied the dame; \"and if you take my advice, you\r\nhad better walk twenty-seven miles there, than two miles back to the\r\nbridge over the river.\"\r\n\r\nSomeone now called from the opposite bank, and she started with the boat\r\nto fetch another passenger.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, very much,\" said Felix, as he wished her good day; \"but why\r\ndid not the man at the other ferry tell me I could cross here?\"\r\n\r\nThe woman laughed outright. \"Do you suppose he was going to put a penny\r\nin my way when he could not get it himself?\"\r\n\r\nSo mean and petty is the world! Felix entered the second city and walked\r\nsome distance through it, when he recollected that he had not eaten for\r\nsome time. He looked in vain for an inn, but upon speaking to a man who\r\nwas leaning on his crutch at a doorway, he was at once asked to enter,\r\nand all that the house afforded was put before him. The man with the\r\ncrutch sat down opposite, and remarked that most of the folk were gone\r\nto the camp, but he could not because his foot had been injured. He then\r\nwent on to tell how it had happened, with the usual garrulity of the\r\nwounded. He was assisting to place the beam of a battering-ram upon a\r\ntruck (it took ten horses to draw it) when a lever snapped, and the beam\r\nfell. Had the beam itself touched him he would have been killed on the\r\nspot; as it was, only a part of the broken lever or pole hit him. Thrown\r\nwith such force, the weight of the ram driving it, the fragment of the\r\npole grazed his leg, and either broke one of the small bones that form\r\nthe arch of the instep, or so bruised it that it was worse than broken.\r\nAll the bone-setters and surgeons had gone to the camp, and he was left\r\nwithout attendance other than the women, who fomented the foot daily,\r\nbut he had little hope of present recovery, knowing that such things\r\nwere often months about.\r\n\r\nHe thought it lucky that it was no worse, for very few, he had noticed,\r\never recovered from serious wounds of spear or arrow. The wounded\r\ngenerally died; only the fortunate escaped. Thus he ran on, talking as\r\nmuch for his own amusement as that of his guest. He fretted because he\r\ncould not join the camp and help work the artillery; he supposed the ram\r\nwould be in position by now and shaking the wall with its blow. He\r\nwondered if Baron Ingulph would miss his face.\r\n\r\n\"Who's he?\" asked Felix.\r\n\r\n\"He is captain of the artillery,\" replied his host.\r\n\r\n\"Are you his retainer?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; I am a servant.\"\r\n\r\nFelix started slightly, and did but just check himself from rising from\r\nthe table. A \"servant\" was a slave; it was the euphemism used instead of\r\nthe hateful word, which not even the most degraded can endure to bear.\r\nThe class of the nobles to which he belonged deemed it a disgrace to sit\r\ndown with a slave, to eat with him, even to accidently touch him. With\r\nthe retainers, or free men, they were on familiar terms, though despotic\r\nto the last degree; the slave was less than the dog. Then, stealing a\r\nglance at the man's face, Felix saw that he had no moustache; he had not\r\nnoticed this before. No slaves were allowed to wear the moustache.\r\n\r\nThis man having been at home ill some days had neglected to shave, and\r\nthere was some mark upon his upper lip. As he caught his guest's glance,\r\nthe slave hung his head, and asked his guest in a low and humble voice\r\nnot to mention this fault. With his face slightly flushed, Felix\r\nfinished his meal; he was confused to the last degree. His long training\r\nand the tone of the society in which he had moved (though so despised a\r\nmember of it) prejudiced him strongly against the man whose hospitality\r\nwas so welcome. On the other hand, the ideas which had for so long\r\nworked in his mind in his solitary intercommunings in the forest were\r\nentirely opposed to servitude. In abstract principle he had long since\r\ncondemned it, and desired to abolish it. But here was the fact.\r\n\r\nHe had eaten at a slave's table, and sat with him face to face. Theory\r\nand practice are often strangely at variance. He felt it an important\r\nmoment; he felt that he was himself, as it were, on the balance; should\r\nhe adhere to the ancient prejudice, the ancient exclusiveness of his\r\nclass, or should he boldly follow the dictate of his mind? He chose the\r\nlatter, and extended his hand to the servant as he rose to say good-bye.\r\nThe act was significant; it recognised man as distinct from caste. The\r\nservant did not know the conflict that had taken place; but to be shaken\r\nhands with at all, even by a retainer as he supposed Felix to be, was\r\nindeed a surprise. He could not understand it; it was the first time his\r\nhand had been taken by any one of superior position since he had been\r\nborn. He was dumb with amazement, and could scarcely point out the road\r\nwhen asked; nor did he take the small coin Felix offered, one of the few\r\nhe possessed. Felix therefore left it on the table and again started.\r\n\r\nPassing through the town, Felix followed the track which led in the\r\ndirection indicated. In about half a mile it led him to a wider track,\r\nwhich he immediately recognised as the main way and road to the camp by\r\nthe ruts and dust, for the sward had been trampled down for fifty yards\r\nwide, and even the corn was cut up by wheels and horses' hoofs. The army\r\nhad passed, and he had but to follow its unmistakable trail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE CAMP\r\n\r\n\r\nFelix walked steadily on for nearly three hours, when the rough track,\r\nthe dust, and heat began to tell upon him, and he sat down beside the\r\nway. The sun was now declining, and the long June day tending to its\r\nend. A horseman passed, coming from the camp, and as he wore only a\r\nsword, and had a leathern bag slung from his shoulder, he appeared to be\r\na courtier. The dust raised by the hoofs, as it rose and floated above\r\nthe brushwood, rendered his course visible. Some time afterwards, while\r\nhe still rested, being very weary with walking through the heat of the\r\nafternoon, he heard the sound of wheels, and two carts drawn by horses\r\ncame along the track from the city.\r\n\r\nThe carts were laden with bundles of arrows, perhaps the same he had\r\nseen unloading that morning from the war-ship, and were accompanied only\r\nby carters. As they approached he rose, feeling that it was time to\r\ncontinue his journey. His tired feet were now stiff, and he limped as he\r\nstepped out into the road. The men spoke, and he walked as well as he\r\ncould beside them, using his boar-spear as a staff. There were two\r\ncarters with each cart; and presently, noting how he lagged, and could\r\nscarce keep pace with them, one of them took a wooden bottle from the\r\nload on his cart, and offered him a draught of ale.\r\n\r\nThus somewhat refreshed, Felix began to talk, and learnt that the arrows\r\nwere from the vessel in whose track he had sailed; that it had been sent\r\nloaded with stores for the king's use, by his friend the Prince of\r\nQuinton; that very great efforts had been made to get together a large\r\narmy in this campaign; first, because the city besieged was so near\r\nhome, and failure might be disastrous, and, secondly, because it was one\r\nof three which were all republics, and the other two would be certain to\r\nsend it assistance. These cities stood in a plain, but a few miles\r\napart, and in a straight line on the banks of the river. The king had\r\njust sat down before the first, vowing that he would knock them down,\r\none after the other, like a row of ninepins.\r\n\r\nThe carters asked him, in return, whose retainer he was, and he said\r\nthat he was on his way to take service, and was under no banner yet.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said the man who had given him a drink, \"if you are free like\r\nthat, you had better join the king's levy, and be careful to avoid the\r\nbarons' war. For if you join either of the barons' war, they will know\r\nyou to be a stranger, and very likely, if they see that you are quick\r\nand active, they will not let you free again, and if you attempt to\r\nescape after the campaign, you will find yourself mightily mistaken. The\r\nbaron's captain would only have to say you had always been his man; and,\r\nas for your word, it would be no more than a dog's bark. Besides which,\r\nif you rebelled, it would be only to shave off that moustache of yours,\r\nand declare you a slave, and as you have no friends in camp, a slave you\r\nwould be.\"\r\n\r\n\"That would be very unjust,\" said Felix. \"Surely the king would not\r\nallow it?\"\r\n\r\n\"How is he to know?\" said another of the carters. \"My brother's boy was\r\nserved just like that. He was born free, the same as all our family, but\r\nhe was fond of roving, and when he reached Quinton, he was seen by Baron\r\nRobert, who was in want of men, and being a likely young fellow, they\r\nshaved his lip, and forced him to labour under the thong. When his\r\nspirit was cowed, and he seemed reconciled, they let him grow his\r\nmoustache again, and there he is now, a retainer, and well treated. But\r\nstill, it was against his will. Jack is right; you had better join the\r\nking's levy.\"\r\n\r\nThe king's levy is composed of his own retainers from his estates, of\r\ntownsmen, who are not retainers of the barons, of any knights and\r\nvolunteers who like to offer their services; and a king always desires\r\nas large a levy as possible, because it enables him to overawe his\r\nbarons. These, when their \"war\", or forces, are collected together in\r\ncamp, are often troublesome, and inclined to usurp authority. A\r\nvolunteer is, therefore, always welcome in the king's levy.\r\n\r\nFelix thanked them for the information they had given him, and said he\r\nshould certainly follow their advice. He could now hardly keep up with\r\nthe carts, having walked for so many hours, and undergone so much\r\nprevious exertion. Finding this to be the case, he wished them\r\ngood-night, and looked round for some cover. It was now dusk, and he\r\nknew he could go no farther. When they understood his intention, they\r\nconsulted among themselves, and finally made him get up into one of the\r\ncarts, and sit down on the bundles of arrows, which filled it like\r\nfaggots. Thus he was jolted along, the rude wheels fitting but badly on\r\nthe axle, and often sinking deep into a rut.\r\n\r\nThey were now in thick forest, and the track was much narrower, so that\r\nit had become worn into a hollow, as if it were the dry bed of a\r\ntorrent. The horses and the carters were weary, yet they were obliged to\r\nplod on, as the arms had to be delivered before the morrow. They spoke\r\nlittle, except to urge the animals. Felix soon dropped into a reclining\r\nposture (uneasy as it was, it was a relief), and looking up, saw the\r\nwhite summer stars above. After a time he lost consciousness, and slept\r\nsoundly, quite worn out, despite the jolting and creaking of the wheels.\r\n\r\nThe sound of a trumpet woke him with a start. His heavy and dreamless\r\nsleep for a moment had taken away his memory, and he did not know where\r\nhe was. As he sat up two sacks fell from him; the carters had thrown\r\nthem over him as a protection against the night's dew. The summer\r\nmorning was already as bright as noonday, and the camp about him was\r\nastir. In half a minute he came to himself, and getting out of the cart\r\nlooked round. All his old interest had returned, the spirit of war\r\nentered into him, the trumpet sounded again, and the morning breeze\r\nextended the many-coloured banners.\r\n\r\nThe spot where he stood was in the rear of the main camp, and but a\r\nshort distance from the unbroken forest. Upon either hand there was an\r\nintermingled mass of stores, carts, and waggons crowded together, sacks\r\nand huge heaps of forage, on and about which scores of slaves, drivers\r\nand others, were sleeping in every possible attitude, many of them\r\nevidently still under the influence of the ale they had drunk the night\r\nbefore. What struck him at once was the absence of any guard here in the\r\nrear. The enemy might steal out from the forest behind and help himself\r\nto what he chose, or murder the sleeping men, or, passing through the\r\nstores, fall on the camp itself. To Felix this neglect appeared\r\ninexplicable; it indicated a mental state which he could not comprehend,\r\na state only to be described by negatives. There was no completeness, no\r\nsystem, no organization; it was a kind of haphazardness, altogether\r\nopposite to his own clear and well-ordered ideas.\r\n\r\nThe ground sloped gently downwards from the edge of the forest, and the\r\nplace where he was had probably been ploughed, but was now trodden flat\r\nand hard. Next in front of the stores he observed a long, low hut built\r\nof poles, and roofed with fir branches; the walls were formed of ferns,\r\nstraw, bundles of hay, anything that had come to hand. On a standard\r\nbeside it, a pale blue banner, with the device of a double hammer worked\r\nin gold upon it, fluttered in the wind. Twenty or thirty, perhaps more,\r\nspears leant against one end of this rude shed, their bright points\r\nprojecting yards above the roof. To the right of the booth as many\r\nhorses were picketed, and not far from them some soldiers were cooking\r\nat an open fire of logs. As Felix came slowly towards the booth, winding\r\nin and out among the carts and heaps of sacks, he saw that similar\r\nerections extended down the slope for a long distance.\r\n\r\nThere were hundreds of them, some large, some small, not placed in any\r\norder, but pitched where chance or fancy led, the first-comers taking\r\nthe sites that pleased them, and the rest crowding round. Beside each\r\nhut stood the banner of the owner, and Felix knew from this that they\r\nwere occupied by the barons, knights, and captains of the army. The\r\nretainers of each baron bivouacked as they might in the open air; some\r\nof them had hunter's hides, and others used bundles of straw to sleep\r\non. Their fire was as close to their lord's hut as convenient, and thus\r\nthere were always plenty within call.\r\n\r\nThe servants, or slaves, also slept in the open air, but in the rear of\r\ntheir owner's booth, and apart from the free retainers. Felix noticed,\r\nthat although the huts were pitched anyhow and anywhere, those on the\r\nlowest ground seemed built along a line, and, looking closer, he found\r\nthat a small stream ran there. He learnt afterwards that there was\r\nusually an emulation among the commanders to set up their standards as\r\nnear the water as possible, on account of convenience, those in the rear\r\nhaving often to lead their horses a long distance to water. Beyond the\r\nstream the ground rose again as gradually as it had declined. It was\r\nopen and cultivated up to the walls of the besieged city, which was not\r\nthree-quarters of a mile distant. Felix could not for the moment\r\ndistinguish the king's head-quarters. The confused manner in which the\r\nbooths were built prevented him from seeing far, though from the higher\r\nground it was easy to look over their low roofs.\r\n\r\nHe now wandered into the centre of the camp, and saw with astonishment\r\ngroups of retainers everywhere eating, drinking, talking, and even\r\nplaying cards or dice, but not a single officer of any rank. At last,\r\nstopping by the embers of a fire, he asked timidly if he might have\r\nbreakfast. The soldiers laughed and pointed to a cart behind them,\r\ntelling him to help himself. The cart was turned with the tail towards\r\nthe fire, and laden with bread and sides of bacon, slices of which the\r\nretainers had been toasting at the embers.\r\n\r\nHe did as he was bid, and the next minute a soldier, not quite steady on\r\nhis legs even at that hour, offered him the can, \"for,\" said he, \"you\r\nhad best drink whilst you may, youngster. There is always plenty of\r\ndrink and good living at the beginning of a war, and very often not a\r\ndrop or a bite to be got in the middle of it.\" Listening to their talk\r\nas he ate his breakfast, Felix found the reason there were no officers\r\nabout was because most of them had drunk too freely the night before.\r\nThe king himself, they said, was put to bed as tight as a drum, and it\r\ntook no small quantity to fill so huge a vessel, for he was a remarkably\r\nbig man.\r\n\r\nAfter the fatigue of the recent march, they had, in fact, refreshed\r\nthemselves, and washed down the dust of the track. They thought that\r\nthis siege was likely to be a very tough business, and congratulated\r\nthemselves that it was not thirty miles to Aisi, so that so long as they\r\nstayed there they might, perhaps, get supplies of provisions with\r\ntolerable regularity. \"But if you're over the water, my lad,\" said the\r\nold fellow with the can, picking his teeth with a twig, \"and have got to\r\nget your victuals by ship; by George, you may have to eat grass, or gnaw\r\nboughs like a horse.\"\r\n\r\nNone of these men wore any arms, except the inevitable knife; their arms\r\nwere piled against the adjacent booth, bows and quivers, spears, swords,\r\nbills and darts, thrown together just as they had cast them aside, and\r\nmore or less rusty from the dew. Felix thought that had the enemy come\r\nsuddenly down in force they might have made a clean sweep of the camp,\r\nfor there were no defences, neither breastwork, nor fosse, nor any set\r\nguard. But he forgot that the enemy were quite as ill-organized as the\r\nbesiegers; probably they were in still greater confusion, for King\r\nIsembard was considered one of the greatest military commanders of his\r\nage, if not the very greatest.\r\n\r\nThe only sign of discipline he saw was the careful grooming of some\r\nhorses, which he rightly guessed to be those ridden by the knights, and\r\nthe equally careful polishing of pieces of armour before the doors of\r\nthe huts. He wished now to inquire his way to the king's levy, but as\r\nthe question rose to his lips he checked himself, remembering the\r\ncaution the friendly carters had given him. He therefore determined to\r\nwalk about the camp till he found some evidence that he was in the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood of the king.\r\n\r\nHe rose, stood about a little while to allay any possible suspicion\r\n(quite needless precautions, for the soldiers were far too agreeably\r\nengaged to take the least notice of him), and then sauntered off with as\r\ncareless an air as he could assume. Looking about him, first at a forge\r\nwhere the blacksmith was shoeing a horse, then at a grindstone, where a\r\nknight's sword was being sharpened, he was nearly knocked down by a\r\nhorse, urged at some speed through the crowds. By a rope from the\r\ncollar, three dead bodies were drawn along the ground, dusty and\r\ndisfigured by bumping against stone and clod. They were those of slaves,\r\nhanged the preceding day, perhaps for pilfering, perhaps for a mere\r\nwhim, since every baron had power of the gallows.\r\n\r\nThey were dragged through the camp, and out a few hundred yards beyond,\r\nand there left to the crows. This horrible sight, to which the rest were\r\nso accustomed and so indifferent that they did not even turn to look at\r\nit, deeply shocked him; the drawn and distorted features, the tongues\r\nprotruding and literally licking the dust, haunted him for long after.\r\nThough his father, as a baron, possessed the same power, it had never\r\nbeen exercised during his tenure of the estate, so that Felix had not\r\nbeen hardened to the sight of executions, common enough elsewhere. Upon\r\nthe Old House estate a species of negative humanity reigned; if the\r\nslaves were not emancipated, they were not hanged or cruelly beaten for\r\ntrifles.\r\n\r\nHastening from the spot, Felix came across the artillery, which\r\nconsisted of battering rams and immense crossbows; the bows were made\r\nfrom entire trees, or, more properly, poles. He inspected these clumsy\r\ncontrivances with interest, and entered into a conversation with some\r\nmen who were fitting up the framework on which a battering ram was to\r\nswing. Being extremely conceited with themselves and the knowledge they\r\nhad acquired from experience only (as the repeated blows of the block\r\ndrive home the pile), they scarcely answered him. But, presently, as he\r\nlent a hand to assist, and bore with their churlishness without reply,\r\nthey softened, and, as usual, asked him to drink, for here, and\r\nthroughout the camp, the ale was plentiful, too plentiful for much\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nFelix took the opportunity and suggested a new form of trigger for the\r\nunwieldy crossbows. He saw that as at present discharged it must require\r\nsome strength, perhaps the united effort of several men, to pull away\r\nthe bolt or catch. Such an effort must disconcert the aim; these\r\ncrossbows were worked upon a carriage, and it was difficult to keep the\r\ncarriage steady even when stakes were inserted by the low wheels. It\r\noccurred to him at once that the catch could be depressed by a lever, so\r\nthat one man could discharge the bow by a mere pressure of the hand, and\r\nwithout interfering with the aim. The men soon understood him, and\r\nacknowledged that it would be a great improvement. One, who was the\r\nleader of the gang, thought it so valuable an idea that he went off at\r\nonce to communicate with the lieutenant, who would in his turn carry the\r\nmatter to Baron Ingulph, Master of the Artillery.\r\n\r\nThe others congratulated him, and asked to share in the reward that\r\nwould be given to him for this invention. To whose \"war\" did he belong?\r\nFelix answered, after a little hesitation, to the king's levy. At this\r\nthey whispered among themselves, and Felix, again remembering the\r\ncarters' caution, said that he must attend the muster (this was a pure\r\nguess), but that he would return directly afterwards. Never for a moment\r\nsuspecting that he would avoid the reward they looked upon as certain,\r\nthey made no opposition, and he hurried away. Pushing through the\r\ngroups, and not in the least knowing where he was going, Felix stumbled\r\nat last upon the king's quarters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE KING'S LEVY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe king's booth stood apart from the rest; it was not much larger, but\r\nproperly thatched with straw, and the wide doorway hung with purple\r\ncurtains. Two standards stood beside it; one much higher than the other.\r\nThe tallest bore the ensign of the kingdom; the lesser, the king's own\r\nprivate banner as a knight. A breastwork encircled the booth, enclosing\r\na space about seventy yards in diameter, with a fosse, and stakes so\r\nplanted as to repel assailants. There was but one gateway, opposite the\r\ngeneral camp, and this was guarded by soldiers fully armed. A knight on\r\nhorseback in armour, except his helmet, rode slowly up and down before\r\nthe gate; he was the officer of the guard. His retainers, some thirty or\r\nforty men, were drawn up close by.\r\n\r\nA distance of fifty yards intervened between this entrenchment and the\r\ncamp, and was kept clear. Within the entrenchment Felix could see a\r\nnumber of gentlemen, and several horses caparisoned, but from the\r\nabsence of noise and the fact that every one appeared to walk daintily\r\nand on tiptoe, he concluded that the king was still sleeping. The stream\r\nran beside the entrenchment, and between it and the city; the king's\r\nquarters were at that corner of the camp highest up the brook, so that\r\nthe water might not be fouled before it reached him.\r\n\r\nThe king's levy, however, did not seem to be hereabouts, for the booths\r\nnearest the head-quarters were evidently occupied by great barons, as\r\nFelix easily knew from their banners. There was here some little\r\nappearance of formality; the soldiery were not so noisy, and there were\r\nseveral officers moving among them. He afterwards discovered that the\r\ngreater barons claimed the right to camp nearest the king, and that the\r\nking's levy was just behind their booths. But unable to discover the\r\nplace, and afraid of losing his liberty if he delayed longer, Felix,\r\nafter hesitating some time, determined to apply direct to the guard at\r\nthe gate of the circular entrenchment.\r\n\r\nAs he crossed the open ground towards it, he noticed that the king's\r\nquarters were the closest to the enemy. Across the little stream were\r\nsome corn-fields, and beyond these the walls of the city, scarcely half\r\na mile distant. There was no outpost, the stream was but a brook, and\r\ncould be crossed with ease. He marvelled at the lack of precaution; but\r\nhe had yet to learn that the enemy, and all the armies of the age, were\r\nequally ignorant and equally careless.\r\n\r\nWith as humble a demeanour as he could assume, Felix doffed his cap and\r\nbegan to speak to the guard at the gateway of the entrenchment. The\r\nnearest man-at-arms immediately raised his spear and struck him with the\r\nbutt. The unexpected blow fell on his left shoulder, and with such force\r\nas to render it powerless. Before he could utter a remonstrance, a\r\nsecond had seized his boar-spear, snapped the handle across his knee,\r\nand hurled the fragments from him. Others then took him by the shoulders\r\nand thrust him back across the open space to the camp, where they kicked\r\nhim and left him, bruised, and almost stupefied with indignation. His\r\noffence was approaching the king's ground with arms in his hands.\r\n\r\nLater in the afternoon he found himself sitting on the bank of the\r\nstream far below the camp. He had wandered thither without knowing where\r\nhe was going or what he was doing. His spirit for the time had been\r\ncrushed, not so much by the physical brutality as by the repulse to his\r\naspirations. Full of high hopes, and conscious of great ideas, he had\r\nbeen beaten like a felon hound.\r\n\r\nFrom this spot beside the brook the distant camp appeared very\r\nbeautiful. The fluttering banners, the green roofs of the booths (of\r\nferns and reeds and boughs), the movement and life, for bodies of troops\r\nwere now marching to and fro, and knights in gay attire riding on\r\nhorseback, made a pleasant scene on the sloping ground with the forest\r\nat the back. Over the stream the sunshine lit up the walls of the\r\nthreatened city, where, too, many flags were waving. Felix came somewhat\r\nto himself as he gazed, and presently acknowledged that he had only had\r\nhimself to blame. He had evidently transgressed a rule, and his\r\nignorance of the rule was no excuse, since those who had any right to be\r\nin the camp at all were supposed to understand it.\r\n\r\nHe got up, and returning slowly towards the camp, passed on his way the\r\ndrinking-place, where a groom was watering some horses. The man called\r\nto him to help hold a spirited charger, and Felix mechanically did as he\r\nwas asked. The fellow's mates had left him to do their work, and there\r\nwere too many horses for him to manage. Felix led the charger for him\r\nback to the camp, and in return was asked to drink. He preferred food,\r\nand a plentiful supply was put before him. The groom, gossiping as he\r\nattended to his duties, said that he always welcomed the beginning of a\r\nwar, for they were often half starved, and had to gnaw the bones, like\r\nthe dogs, in peace. But when war was declared, vast quantities of\r\nprovisions were got together, and everybody gorged at their will. The\r\nvery dogs battened; he pointed to half a dozen who were tearing a raw\r\nshoulder of mutton to pieces. Before the campaign was over, those very\r\ndogs might starve. To what \"war\" did Felix belong? He replied to the\r\nking's levy.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe groom said that this was the king's levy where they were; but under\r\nwhose command was he? This puzzled Felix, who did not know what to say,\r\nand ended by telling the truth, and begging the fellow to advise him, as\r\nhe feared to lose his liberty. The man said he had better stay where he\r\nwas, and serve with him under Master Lacy, who was mean enough in the\r\ncity, but liked to appear liberal when thus consorting with knights and\r\ngentlemen.\r\n\r\nMaster Lacy was a merchant of Aisi, an owner of vessels. Like most of\r\nhis fellows, when war came so close home, he was almost obliged to join\r\nthe king's levy. Had he not done so it would have been recorded against\r\nhim as a lack of loyalty. His privileges would have been taken from him,\r\npossibly the wealth he had accumulated seized, and himself reduced to\r\nslavery. Lacy, therefore, put on armour, and accompanied the king to the\r\ncamp. Thus Felix, after all his aspirations, found himself serving as\r\nthe knave of a mere citizen.\r\n\r\nHe had to take the horses down to water, to scour arms, to fetch wood\r\nfrom the forest for the fire. He was at the beck and call of all the\r\nother men, who never scrupled to use his services, and, observing that\r\nhe never refused, put upon him all the more. On the other hand, when\r\nthere was nothing doing, they were very kind and even thoughtful. They\r\nshared the best with him, brought wine occasionally (wine was scarce,\r\nthough ale plentiful) as a delicacy, and one, who had dexterously taken\r\na purse, presented him with half a dozen copper coins as his share of\r\nthe plunder. Felix, grown wiser by experience, did not dare refuse the\r\nstolen money, it would have been considered as the greatest insult; he\r\nwatched his opportunity and threw it away.\r\n\r\nThe men, of course, quickly discovered his superior education, but that\r\ndid not in the least surprise them, it being extremely common for\r\nunfortunate people to descend by degrees to menial offices, if once they\r\nleft the estate and homestead to which they naturally belonged. There as\r\ncadets, however humble, they were certain of outward respect: once\r\noutside the influence of the head of the house, and they were worse off\r\nthan the lowest retainer. His fellows would have resented any show of\r\npride, and would speedily have made his life intolerable. As he showed\r\nnone, they almost petted him, but at the same time expected him to do\r\nmore than his share of the work.\r\n\r\nFelix listened with amazement to the revelations (revelations to him) of\r\nthe inner life of the camp and court. The king's weaknesses, his\r\ninordinate gluttony and continual intoxication, his fits of temper, his\r\nfollies and foibles, seemed as familiar to these grooms as if they had\r\ndwelt with him. As for the courtiers and barons, there was not one whose\r\nvices and secret crimes were not perfectly well known to them. Vice and\r\ncrime must have their instruments; instruments are invariably\r\nindiscreet, and thus secrets escape. The palace intrigues, the intrigues\r\nwith other states, the influence of certain women, there was nothing\r\nwhich they did not know.\r\n\r\nSeen thus from below, the whole society appeared rotten and corrupted,\r\ncoarse to the last degree, and animated only by the lowest motives. This\r\nvery gossip seemed in itself criminal to Felix, but he did not at the\r\nmoment reflect that it was but the tale of servants. Had such language\r\nbeen used by gentlemen, then it would have been treason. As himself of\r\nnoble birth, Felix had hitherto seen things only from the point of view\r\nof his own class. Now he associated with grooms, he began to see society\r\nfrom _their_ point of view, and recognised how feebly it was held\r\ntogether by brute force, intrigue, cord and axe, and woman's flattery.\r\nBut a push seemed needed to overthrow it. Yet it was quite secure,\r\nnevertheless, as there was none to give that push, and if any such plot\r\nhad been formed, those very slaves who suffered the most would have been\r\nthe very men to give information, and to torture the plotters.\r\n\r\nFelix had never dreamed that common and illiterate men, such as these\r\ngrooms and retainers, could have any conception of reasons of State, or\r\nthe crafty designs of courts. He now found that, though they could\r\nneither writer nor read, they had learned the art of reading man (the\r\nworst and lowest side of character) to such perfection that they at once\r\ndetected the motive. They read the face; the very gait and gesture gave\r\nthem a clue. They read man, in fact, as an animal. They understood men\r\njust as they understood the horses and hounds under their charge. Every\r\nmood and vicious indication in those animals was known to them, and so,\r\ntoo, with their masters.\r\n\r\nFelix thought that he was himself a hunter, and understood woodcraft; he\r\nnow found how mistaken he had been. He had acquired woodcraft as a\r\ngentleman; he now learned the knave's woodcraft. They taught him a\r\nhundred tricks of which he had had no idea. They stripped man of his\r\ndignity, and nature of her refinement. Everything had a blackguard side\r\nto them. He began to understand that high principles and abstract\r\ntheories were only words with the mass of men.\r\n\r\nOne day he saw a knight coolly trip up a citizen (one of the king's\r\nlevy) in the midst of the camp and in broad daylight, and quietly cut\r\naway his purse, at least a score of persons looking on. But they were\r\nonly retainers and slaves; there was no one whose word would for a\r\nmoment have been received against the knight's, who had observed this,\r\nand plundered the citizen with impunity. He flung the lesser coins to\r\nthe crowd, keeping the gold and silver for himself, and walked off\r\namidst their plaudits.\r\n\r\nFelix saw a slave nailed to a tree, his arms put round it so as to clasp\r\nit, and then nails driven through them. There he was left in his agony\r\nto perish. No one knew what his fault had been; his master had simply\r\ntaken a dislike to him. A guard was set that no one should relieve the\r\nmiserable being. Felix's horror and indignation could not have been\r\nexpressed, but he was totally helpless.\r\n\r\nHis own condition of mind during this time was such as could not be well\r\nanalysed. He did not himself understand whether his spirit had been\r\nbroken, whether he was really degraded with the men with whom he lived,\r\nor why he remained with them, though there were moments when it dawned\r\nupon him that this education, rude as it was, was not without its value\r\nto him. He need not practise these evils, but it was well to know of\r\ntheir existence. Thus he remained, as it were, quiescent, and the days\r\npassed on. He really had not much to do, although the rest put their\r\nburdens upon him, for discipline was so lax, that the loosest attendance\r\nanswered equally well with the most conscientious. The one thing all the\r\nmen about him seemed to think of was the satisfying of their appetites;\r\nthe one thing they rejoiced at was the fine dry weather, for, as his\r\nmates told him, the misery of camp life in rain was almost unendurable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nFIGHTING\r\n\r\n\r\nTwice Felix saw the king. Once there was a review of the horse outside\r\nthe camp, and Felix, having to attend with his master's third charger (a\r\nmere show and affectation, for there was not the least chance of his\r\nneeding it), was now and then very near the monarch. For that day at\r\nleast he looked every whit what fame had reported him to be. A man of\r\nunusual size, his bulk rendered him conspicuous in the front of the\r\nthrong. His massive head seemed to accord well with the possession of\r\ndespotic power.\r\n\r\nThe brow was a little bare, for he was no longer young, but the back of\r\nhis head was covered with thick ringlets of brown hair, so thick as to\r\npartly conceal the coronet of gold which he wore. A short purple cloak,\r\nscarcely reaching to the waist, was thrown back off his shoulders, so\r\nthat his steel corselet glistened in the sun. It was the only armour he\r\nhad on; a long sword hung at his side. He rode a powerful black horse,\r\nfull eighteen hands high, by far the finest animal on the ground; he\r\nrequired it, for his weight must have been great. Felix passed near\r\nenough to note that his eyes were brown, and the expression of his face\r\nopen, frank, and pleasing. The impression left upon the observer was\r\nthat of a strong intellect, but a still stronger physique, which latter\r\ntoo often ran away with and controlled the former. No one could look\r\nupon him without admiration, and it was difficult to think that he could\r\nso demean himself as to wallow in the grossest indulgence.\r\n\r\nAs for the review, though it was a brilliant scene, Felix could not\r\nconceal from himself that these gallant knights were extremely irregular\r\nin their movements, and not one single evolution was performed\r\ncorrectly, because they were constantly quarrelling about precedence,\r\nand one would not consent to follow the other. He soon understood,\r\nhowever, that discipline was not the object, nor regularity considered;\r\npersonal courage and personal dexterity were everything. This review was\r\nthe prelude to active operations, and Felix now hoped to have some\r\npractical lessons in warfare.\r\n\r\nHe was mistaken. Instead of a grand assault, or a regular approach, the\r\nfighting was merely a series of combats between small detachments and\r\nbodies of the enemy. Two or three knights with their retainers and\r\nslaves would start forth, cross the stream, and riding right past the\r\nbesieged city endeavour to sack some small hamlet, or the homestead of a\r\nnoble. From the city a sortie would ensue; sometimes the two bodies only\r\nthreatened each other at a distance, the first retiring as the second\r\nadvanced. Sometimes only a few arrows were discharged; occasionally they\r\ncame to blows, but the casualties were rarely heavy.\r\n\r\nOne such party, while returning, was followed by a squadron of horsemen\r\nfrom the town towards the stream to within three hundred yards of the\r\nking's quarters. Incensed at this assurance, several knights mounted\r\ntheir horses and rode out to reinforce the returning detachment, which\r\nwas loaded with booty. Finding themselves about to be supported, they\r\nthrew down their spoils, faced about, and Felix saw for the first time a\r\nreal and desperate _melée_. It was over in five minutes. The king's\r\nknights, far better horsed, and filled with desire to exhibit their\r\nvalour to the camp, charged with such fury that they overthrew the enemy\r\nand rode over him.\r\n\r\nFelix saw the troops meet; there was a crash and cracking as the lances\r\nbroke, four or five rolled from the saddle on the trodden corn, and the\r\nnext moment the entangled mass of men and horses unwound itself as the\r\nenemy hastened back to the walls. Felix was eager to join in such an\r\naffray, but he had no horse nor weapon. Upon another occasion early one\r\nbright morning four knights and their followers, about forty in all,\r\ndeliberately set out from the camp, and advanced up the sloping ground\r\ntowards the city. The camp was soon astir watching their proceedings;\r\nand the king, being made acquainted with what was going on, came out\r\nfrom his booth. Felix, who now entered the circular entrenchment without\r\nany difficulty, got up on the mound with scores of others, where,\r\nholding to the stakes, they had a good view.\r\n\r\nThe king stood on a bench and watched the troops advance, shading his\r\neyes with his hand. As it was but half a mile to the walls they could\r\nsee all that took place. When the knights had got within two hundred\r\nyards and arrows began to drop amongst them, they dismounted from their\r\nhorses and left them in charge of the grooms, who walked them up and\r\ndown, none remaining still a minute, so as to escape the aim of the\r\nenemy's archers. Then drawing their swords, the knights, who were in\r\nfull armour, put themselves at the head of the band, and advanced at a\r\nsteady pace to the wall. In their mail with their shields before them\r\nthey cared not for such feeble archery, nor even for the darts that\r\npoured upon them when they came within reach. There was no fosse to the\r\nwall, so that, pushing forward, they were soon at the foot. So easily\r\nhad they reached it that Felix almost thought the city already won. Now\r\nhe saw blocks of stone, darts, and beams of wood cast at them from the\r\nparapet, which was not more than twelve feet above the ground.\r\n\r\nQuite undismayed, the knights set up their ladders, of which they had\r\nbut four, one each. The men-at-arms held these by main force against the\r\nwall, the besiegers trying to throw them away, and chopping at the rungs\r\nwith their axes. But the ladders were well shod with iron to resist such\r\nblows, and in a moment Felix saw, with intense delight and admiration,\r\nthe four knights slowly mount to the parapet and cut at the defenders\r\nwith their swords. The gleam of steel was distinctly visible as the\r\nblades rose and fell. The enemy thrust at them with pikes, but seemed to\r\nshrink from closer combat, and a moment afterwards the gallant four\r\nstood on the top of the wall. Their figures, clad in mail and shield in\r\nhand, were distinctly seen against the sky. Up swarmed the men-at-arms\r\nbehind them, and some seemed to descend on the other side. A shout rose\r\nfrom the camp and echoed over the woods. Felix shouted with the rest,\r\nwild with excitement.\r\n\r\nThe next minute, while yet the knights stood on the wall, and scarcely\r\nseemed to know what to do next, there appeared at least a dozen men in\r\narmour running along the wall towards them. Felix afterwards understood\r\nthat the ease with which the four won the wall at first was owing to\r\nthere being no men of knightly rank among the defenders at that early\r\nhour. Those who had collected to repulse the assault were citizens,\r\nretainers, slaves, any, in fact who had been near. But now the news had\r\nreached the enemy's leaders, and some of them hastened to the wall. As\r\nthese were seen approaching, the camp was hushed, and every eye strained\r\non the combatants.\r\n\r\nThe noble four could not all meet their assailants, the wall was but\r\nwide enough for two to fight; but the other two had work enough the next\r\nminute, as eight or ten more men in mail advanced the other way. So they\r\nfought back to back, two facing one way, and two the other. The swords\r\nrose and fell. Felix saw a flash of light fly up into the air, it was\r\nthe point of a sword broken off short. At the foot of the wall the men\r\nwho had not had time to mount endeavoured to assist their masters by\r\nstabbing upwards with their spears.\r\n\r\nAll at once two of the knights were hurled from the wall; one seemed to\r\nbe caught by his men, the other came heavily to the ground. While they\r\nwere fighting their immediate antagonists, others within the wall had\r\ncome with lances; and literally thrust them from the parapet. The other\r\ntwo still fought back to back for a moment; then, finding themselves\r\noverwhelmed, they sprang down among their friends.\r\n\r\nThe minute the two first fell, the grooms with the horses ran towards\r\nthe wall, and despite the rain of arrows, darts, and stones from the\r\nparapet, Felix saw with relief three of the four knights placed on their\r\nchargers. One only could sit upright unassisted, two were supported in\r\ntheir saddles, and the fourth was carried by his retainers. Thus they\r\nretreated, and apparently without further hurt, for the enemy on the\r\nwall crowded so much together as to interfere with the aim of their\r\ndarts, which, too, soon fell short. But there was a dark heap beneath\r\nthe wall, where ten or twelve retainers and slaves, who wore no armour,\r\nhad been slain or disabled. Upon these the loss invariably fell.\r\n\r\nNone attempted to follow the retreating party, who slowly returned\r\ntowards the camp, and were soon apparently in safety. But suddenly a\r\nfresh party of the enemy appeared upon the wall, and the instant\r\nafterwards three retainers dropped, as if struck by lightning. They had\r\nbeen hit by sling stones, whirled with great force by practised\r\nslingers. These rounded pebbles come with such impetus as to stun a man\r\nat two hundred yards. The aim, it is true, is uncertain, but where there\r\nis a body of troops they are sure to strike some one. Hastening on,\r\nleaving the three fallen men where they lay, the rest in two minutes\r\nwere out of range, and came safely into camp. Everyone, as they crossed\r\nthe stream, ran to meet them, the king included, and as he passed in the\r\nthrong, Felix heard him remark that they had had a capital main of cocks\r\nthat morning.\r\n\r\nOf the knights only one was much injured; he had fallen upon a stone,\r\nand two ribs were broken; the rest suffered from severe bruises, but had\r\nno wound. Six men-at-arms were missing, probably prisoners, for, as\r\ncourageous as their masters, they had leapt down from the wall into the\r\ntown. Eleven other retainers or slaves were slain, or had deserted, or\r\nwere prisoners, and no trouble was taken about them. As for the three\r\nwho were knocked over by the sling stones, there they lay until they\r\nrecovered their senses, when they crawled into camp. This incident\r\ncooled Felix's ardour for the fray, for he reflected that, if injured\r\nthus, he too, as a mere groom, would be left. The devotion of the\r\nretainers to save and succour their masters was almost heroic. The\r\nmailed knights thought no more of their men, unless it was some\r\nparticular favourite, than of a hound slashed by a boar's tusk in the\r\nchase.\r\n\r\nWhen the first flush of his excitement had passed, Felix, thinking over\r\nthe scene of the morning as he took his horses down to water at the\r\nstream, became filled at first with contempt, and then with indignation.\r\nThat the first commander of the age should thus look on while the wall\r\nwas won before his eyes, and yet never send a strong detachment, or move\r\nhimself with his whole army to follow up the advantage, seemed past\r\nunderstanding. If he did not intend to follow it up, why permit such\r\ndesperate ventures, which must be overwhelmed by mere numbers, and could\r\nresult only in the loss of brave men? And if he did permit it, why did\r\nhe not, when he saw they were overthrown, send a squadron to cover their\r\nretreat? To call such an exhibition of courage \"a main of cocks\", to\r\nlook on it as a mere display for his amusement, was barbarous and cruel\r\nin the extreme. He worked himself up into a state of anger which\r\nrendered him less cautious than usual in expressing his opinions.\r\n\r\nThe king was not nearly so much at fault as Felix, arguing on abstract\r\nprinciples, imagined. He had long experience of war, and he knew its\r\nextreme uncertainty. The issue of the greatest battle often hung on the\r\nconduct of a single leader, or even a single man-at-arms. He had seen\r\nwalls won and lost before. To follow up such a venture with a strong\r\ndetachment must result in one of two things, either the detachment in\r\nits turn must be supported by the entire army, or it must eventually\r\nretreat. If it retreated, the loss of prestige would be serious, and\r\nmight encourage the enemy to attack the camp, for it was only his\r\nprestige which prevented them. If supported by the entire army, then the\r\nfate of the whole expedition depended upon that single day.\r\n\r\nThe enemy had the advantage of the wall, of the narrow streets and\r\nenclosures within, of the houses, each of which would become a fortress,\r\nand thus in the winding streets a repulse might easily happen. To risk\r\nsuch an event would be folly in the last degree, before the town had\r\nbeen dispirited and discouraged by the continuance of the siege, the\r\nfailure of their provisions, or the fall of their chief leaders in the\r\ndaily combats that took place.\r\n\r\nThe army had no discipline whatever, beyond that of the attachment of\r\nthe retainer to his lord, and the dread of punishment on the part of the\r\nslave. There were no distinct ranks, no organized corps. The knights\r\nfollowed the greater barons, the retainers the knights; the greater\r\nbarons followed the king. Such an army could not be risked in an assault\r\nof this kind. The venture was not ordered, nor was it discouraged; to\r\ndiscourage, indeed, all attempts would have been bad policy; it was upon\r\nthe courage and bravery of his knights that the king depended, and upon\r\nthat alone rested his hopes of victory.\r\n\r\nThe great baron whose standard they followed would have sent them\r\nassistance if he had deemed it necessary. The king, unless on the day of\r\nbattle, would not trouble about such a detail. As for the remark, that\r\nthey had had \"a good main of cocks that morning,\" he simply expressed\r\nthe feeling of the whole camp. The spectacle Felix had seen was, in\r\nfact, merely an instance of the strength and of the weakness of the army\r\nand the monarch himself.\r\n\r\nFelix afterwards acknowledged these things to himself, but at the\r\nmoment, full of admiration for the bravery of the four knights and their\r\nfollowers, he was full of indignation, and uttered his views too freely.\r\nHis fellow-grooms cautioned him; but his spirit was up, and he gave way\r\nto his feelings without restraint. Now, to laugh at the king's\r\nweaknesses, his gluttony or follies, was one thing; to criticise his\r\nmilitary conduct was another. The one was merely badinage, and the king\r\nhimself might have laughed had he heard it; the other was treason, and,\r\nmoreover, likely to touch the monarch on the delicate matter of military\r\nreputation.\r\n\r\nOf this Felix quickly became aware. His mates, indeed, tried to shield\r\nhim; but possibly the citizen, his master, had enemies in the camp,\r\nbarons, perhaps, to whom he had lent money, and who watched for a chance\r\nof securing his downfall. At all events, early the next day Felix was\r\nrudely arrested by the provost in person, bound with cords, and placed\r\nin the provost's booth. At the same time, his master was ordered to\r\nremain within, and a guard was put over him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nIN DANGER\r\n\r\n\r\nHope died within Felix when he thus suddenly found himself so near the\r\nexecutioner. He had known so many butchered without cause, that he had,\r\nindeed, reason to despair. Towards the sunset he felt sure he should be\r\ndragged forth and hanged on the oak used for the purpose, and which\r\nstood near where the track from Aisi joined the camp. Such would most\r\nprobably have been his fate, had he been alone concerned in this affair,\r\nbut by good fortune he was able to escape so miserable an end. Still, he\r\nsuffered as much as if the rope had finished him, for he had no means of\r\nknowing what would be the result.\r\n\r\nHis heart swelled with bitterness; he was filled with inexpressible\r\nindignation, his whole being rebelled against the blundering, as it\r\nwere, of events which had thus thrown him into the jaws of death. In an\r\nhour or two, however, he sufficiently recovered from the shock to\r\nreflect that most probably they would give him some chance to speak for\r\nhimself. There would not be any trial; who would waste time in trying so\r\ninsignificant a wretch? But there might be some opportunity of speaking,\r\nand he resolved to use it to the utmost possible extent.\r\n\r\nHe would arraign the unskilful generalship of the king; he would not\r\nonly point out his errors, but how the enemy could be defeated. He would\r\nprove that he had ideas and plans worthy of attention. He would, as it\r\nwere, vindicate himself before he was executed, and he tried to collect\r\nhis thoughts and to put them into form. Every moment the face of Aurora\r\nseemed to look upon him, lovingly and mournfully; but beside it he saw\r\nthe dusty and distorted features of the copse he had seen drawn by the\r\nhorse through the camp. Thus, too, his tongue would protrude and lick\r\nthe dust. He endured, in a word, those treble agonies which the\r\nhighly-wrought and imaginative inflict upon themselves.\r\n\r\nThe hours passed, and still no one came near him; he called, and the\r\nguard appeared at the door, but only to see what was the matter, and\r\nfinding his prisoner safe, at once resumed his walk to and fro. The\r\nsoldier did not, for his own sake, dare to enter into conversation with\r\na prisoner under arrest for such an offence; he might be involved, or\r\nsuspected. Had it been merely theft or any ordinary crime, he would have\r\ntalked freely enough, and sympathized with the prisoner. As time went\r\non, Felix grew thirsty, but his request for water was disregarded, and\r\nthere he remained till four in the afternoon. They then marched him out;\r\nhe begged to be allowed to speak, but the soldiery did not reply, simply\r\nhurrying him forward. He now feared that he should be executed without\r\nthe chance being afforded him to say a word; but, to his surprise, he\r\nfound in a few minutes that they were taking him in the direction of the\r\nking's quarters. New fears now seized him, for he had heard of men being\r\nturned loose, made to run for their lives, and hunted down with hounds\r\nfor the amusement of the Court.\r\n\r\nIf the citizen's wealth had made him many enemies (men whom he had\r\nbefriended, and who hoped, if they could be see him executed, to escape\r\nthe payment of their debts), on the other hand, it had made him as many\r\nfriends, that is, interested friends, who trusted by doing him service\r\nto obtain advances. These latter had lost no time, for greed is quite as\r\neager as hate, and carried the matter at once to the king. What they\r\ndesired was that the case should be decided by the monarch himself, and\r\nnot by his chancellor, or a judge appointed for the purpose. The judge\r\nwould be nearly certain to condemn the citizen, and to confiscate\r\nwhatever he could lay hands on. The king might pardon, and would be\r\ncontent with a part only, where his ministers would grasp all.\r\n\r\nThese friends succeeded in their object; the king, who hated all\r\njudicial affairs because they involved the trouble of investigation,\r\nshrugged his shoulders at the request, and would not have granted it had\r\nit not come out that the citizen's servant had declared him to be an\r\nincapable commander. At this the king started. \"We are, indeed, fallen\r\nlow,\" said he, \"when a miserable trader's knave calls us incapable. We\r\nwill see this impudent rascal.\" He accordingly ordered that the prisoner\r\nshould be brought before him after dinner.\r\n\r\nFelix was led inside the entrenchment, unbound, and commanded to stand\r\nupright. There was a considerable assembly of the greater barons anxious\r\nto see the trial of the money-lender, who, though present, was kept\r\napart from Felix lest the two should arrange their defence. The king was\r\nsleeping on a couch outside the booth in the shade; he was lying on his\r\nback breathing loudly with open mouth. How different his appearance to\r\nthe time when he sat on his splendid charger and reviewed his knights! A\r\nheavy meal had been succeeded by as heavy a slumber. No one dared to\r\ndisturb him; the assembly moved on tiptoe and conversed in whispers. The\r\nexperienced divined that the prisoners were certain to be condemned, for\r\nthe king would wake with indigestion, and vent his uneasy sensations\r\nupon them. Full an hour elapsed before the king awoke with a snort and\r\ncalled for a draught of water. How Felix envied that draught! He had\r\nneither eaten nor drunk since the night previous; it was a hot day, and\r\nhis tongue was dry and parched.\r\n\r\nThe citizen was first accused; he denied any treasonable designs or\r\nexpressions whatever; as for the other prisoner, till the time he was\r\narrested he did not even know he had been in his service. He was some\r\nstroller whom his grooms had incautiously engaged, the lazy scoundrels,\r\nto assist them. He had never even spoken to him; it the knave told the\r\ntruth he must acknowledge this.\r\n\r\n\"How now,\" said the king, turning to Felix; \"what do you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is true,\" replied Felix, \"he has never spoken to me nor I to him. He\r\nknew nothing of what I said. I said it on my own account, and I say it\r\nagain!\"\r\n\r\n\"And pray, sir knave,\" said the king, sitting up on his couch, for he\r\nwas surprised to hear one so meanly dressed speak so correctly, and so\r\nboldly face him. \"What was it you did say?\"\r\n\r\n\"If your majesty will order me a single drop of water,\" said the\r\nprisoner, \"I will repeat it word for word, but I have had nothing the\r\nwhole day, and I can hardly move my tongue.\"\r\n\r\nWithout a word the king handed him the cup from which he had himself\r\ndrunk. Never, surely, was water so delicious. Felix drained it to the\r\nbottom, handed it back (an officer took it), and with one brief thought\r\nof Aurora, he said: \"Your majesty, you are an incapable commander.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go on,\" said the king sarcastically; \"why am I incapable?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have attacked the wrong city; these three are all your enemies, and\r\nyou have attacked the first. They stand in a row.\"\r\n\r\n\"They stand in a row,\" repeated the king; \"and we will knock them over\r\nlike three nine-pins.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you have begun with the end one,\" said Felix, \"and that is the\r\nmistake. For after you have taken the first you must take the second,\r\nand still after that the third. But you might have saved much trouble\r\nand time if----\"\r\n\r\n\"If what?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you had assaulted the middle one first. For then, while the siege\r\nwent on, you would have been able to prevent either of the other two\r\ntowns from sending assistance, and when you had taken the first and put\r\nyour garrison in it, neither of the others could have stirred, or reaped\r\ntheir corn, nor could they even communicate with each other, since you\r\nwould be between them; and in fact you would have cut your enemies in\r\ntwain.\"\r\n\r\n\"By St. John!\" swore the king, \"it is a good idea. I begin to think--but\r\ngo on, you have more to say.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think, too, your majesty, that by staying here as you have done this\r\nfortnight past without action, you have encouraged the other two cities\r\nto make more desperate resistance; and it seems to me that you are in a\r\ndangerous position, and may at any moment be overwhelmed with disaster,\r\nfor there is nothing whatever to prevent either of the other two from\r\nsending troops to burn the open city of Aisi in your absence. And that\r\ndanger must increase every day as they take courage by your idleness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Idleness! There shall be idleness no longer. The man speaks the truth;\r\nwe will consider further of this, we will move on Adelinton,\" turning to\r\nhis barons.\r\n\r\n\"If it please your majesty,\" said Baron Ingulph, \"this man invented a\r\nnew trigger for our carriage crossbows, but he was lost in the crowd,\r\nand we have sought for him in vain; my serjeant here has this moment\r\nrecognised him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did you not come to us before, fellow?\" said the king. \"Let him be\r\nreleased; let him be entertained at our expense; give him clothes and a\r\nsword. We will see you further.\"\r\n\r\nOverjoyed at this sudden turn of fortune, Felix forgot to let well\r\nalone. He had his audience with him for a moment; he could not resist as\r\nit were following up his victory. He thanked the king, and added that he\r\ncould make a machine which would knock the walls yonder to pieces\r\nwithout it being necessary to approach nearer than half a bow-shot.\r\n\r\n\"What is this?\" said the king. \"Ingulph, have you ever heard of such a\r\nmachine?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no such thing,\" said the Baron, beginning to feel that his\r\nprofessional reputation as the master of the artillery was assailed.\r\n\"There is nothing of the kind known.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will shoot stones as big, as heavy as a man can lift,\" said Felix\r\neagerly, \"and easily knock towers to fragments.\"\r\n\r\nThe king looked from one to another; he was incredulous. The Baron\r\nsmiled scornfully. \"Ask him, your majesty, how these stones are to be\r\nthrown; no bow could do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"How are the stones to be thrown?\" said the king sharply. \"Beware how\r\nyou play with us.\"\r\n\r\n\"By the force of twisted ropes, your majesty.\"\r\n\r\nThey all laughed. The Baron said: \"You see, your majesty, there is\r\nnothing of the kind. This is some jester.\"\r\n\r\n\"The twisted rope should be a halter,\" said another courtier, one of\r\nthose who hoped for the rich man's downfall.\r\n\r\n\"It can be done, your majesty,\" cried Felix, alarmed. \"I assure you, a\r\nstone of two hundredweight might be thrown a quarter of a mile.\"\r\n\r\nThe assembly did not repress its contempt.\r\n\r\n\"The man is a fool,\" said the king, who now thought that Felix was a\r\njester who had put a trick upon him. \"But your joke is out of joint; I\r\nwill teach such fellows to try tricks on us! Beat him out of camp.\"\r\n\r\nThe provost's men seized him, and in a moment he was dragged off his\r\nfeet, and bodily carried outside the entrenchment. Thence they pushed\r\nhim along, beating him with the butts of their spears to make him run\r\nthe faster; the groups they passed laughed and jeered; the dogs barked\r\nand snapped at his ankles. They hurried him outside the camp, and\r\nthrusting him savagely with their spear butts sent him headlong. There\r\nthey left him, with the caution which he did not hear, being insensible,\r\nthat if he ventured inside the lines he would be at once hanged. Like a\r\ndead dog they left him on the ground.\r\n\r\nSome hours later, in the dusk of the evening, Felix stole from the spot,\r\nskirting the forest like a wild animal afraid to venture from its cover,\r\ntill he reached the track which led to Aisi. His one idea was to reach\r\nhis canoe. He would have gone through the woods, but that was not\r\npossible. Without axe or wood-knife to hew a way, the tangled brushwood\r\nhe knew to be impassable, having observed how thick it was when coming.\r\nAching and trembling in every limb, not so much with physical suffering\r\nas that kind of inward fever which follows unmerited injury, the revolt\r\nof the mind against it, he followed the track as fast as his weary frame\r\nwould let him. He had tasted nothing that day but the draught from the\r\nking's cup, and a second draught when he recovered consciousness, from\r\nthe stream that flowed past the camp. Yet he walked steadily on without\r\npause; his head hung forward, and his arms were listless, but his feet\r\nmechanically plodded on. He walked, indeed, by his will, and not with\r\nhis sinews. Thus, like a ghost, for there was no life in him, he\r\ntraversed the shadowy forest.\r\n\r\nThe dawn came, and still he kept onwards. As the sun rose higher, having\r\nnow travelled fully twenty miles, he saw houses on the right of the\r\ntrail. They were evidently those of retainers or workmen employed on the\r\nmanor, for a castle stood at some distance.\r\n\r\nAn hour later he approached the second or open city of Aisi, where the\r\nferry was across the channel. In his present condition he could not pass\r\nthrough the town. No one there knew of his disgrace, but it was the same\r\nto him as if they had. Avoiding the town itself, he crossed the\r\ncultivated fields, and upon arriving at the channel he at once stepped\r\nin, and swam across to the opposite shore. It was not more than sixty\r\nyards, but, weary as he was, it was an exhausting effort. He sat down,\r\nbut immediately got up and struggled on.\r\n\r\nThe church tower on the slope of the hill was a landmark by which he\r\neasily discovered the direction of the spot where he had hidden the\r\ncanoe. But he felt unable to push through the belt of brushwood, reeds,\r\nand flags beside the shore, and therefore struck through the firs,\r\nfollowing a cattle track, which doubtless led to another grazing ground.\r\nThis ran parallel with the shore, and when he judged himself about level\r\nwith the canoe he left it, and entered the wood itself. For a little way\r\nhe could walk, but the thick fir branches soon blocked his progress, and\r\nhe could progress only on hands and knees, creeping beneath them. There\r\nwas a hollow space under the lower branches free from brushwood.\r\n\r\nThus he painfully approached the Lake, and descending the hill, after an\r\nhour's weary work emerged among the rushes and reeds. He was within two\r\nhundred yards of the canoe, for he recognised the island opposite it. In\r\nten minutes he found it undisturbed and exactly as he had left it,\r\nexcept that the breeze had strewn the dry reeds with which it was\r\ncovered with willow leaves, yellow and dead (they fall while all the\r\nrest are green), which had been whirled from the branches. Throwing\r\nhimself upon the reeds beside the canoe, he dropped asleep as if he had\r\nbeen dead.\r\n\r\nHe awoke as the sun was sinking and sat up, hungry in the extreme, but\r\nmuch refreshed. There were still some stores in the canoe, of which he\r\nate ravenously. But he felt better now; he felt at home beside his boat.\r\nHe could hardly believe in the reality of the hideous dream through\r\nwhich he had passed. But when he tried to stand, his feet, cut and\r\nblistered, only too painfully assured him of its reality. He took out\r\nhis hunter's hide and cloak and spread himself a comfortable bed. Though\r\nhe had slept so long he was still weary. He reclined in a\r\nsemi-unconscious state, his frame slowly recovering from the strain it\r\nhad endured, till by degrees he fell asleep again. Sleep, nothing but\r\nsleep, restores the overtaxed mind and body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nA VOYAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sun was up when Felix awoke, and as he raised himself the beauty of\r\nthe Lake before him filled him with pleasure. By the shore it was so\r\ncalm that the trees were perfectly reflected, and the few willow leaves\r\nthat had fallen floated without drifting one way or the other. Farther\r\nout the islands were lit up with the sunlight, and the swallows skimmed\r\nthe water, following the outline of their shores. In the Lake beyond\r\nthem, glimpses of which he could see through the channel or passage\r\nbetween, there was a ripple where the faint south-western breeze touched\r\nthe surface. His mind went out to the beauty of it. He did not question\r\nor analyse his feelings; he launched his vessel, and left that hard and\r\ntyrannical land for the loveliness of the water.\r\n\r\nPaddling out to the islands he passed through between them, and reached\r\nthe open Lake. There he hoisted the sail, the gentle breeze filled it,\r\nthe sharp cutwater began to divide the ripples, a bubbling sound arose,\r\nand steering due north, straight out to the open and boundless expanse,\r\nhe was carried swiftly away.\r\n\r\nThe mallards, who saw the canoe coming, at first scarcely moved, never\r\nthinking that a boat would venture outside the islands, within whose\r\nline they were accustomed to see vessels, but when the canoe continued\r\nto bear down upon them, they flew up and descended far away to one side.\r\nWhen he had sailed past the spot where these birds had floated, the Lake\r\nwas his own. By the shores of the islands the crows came down for\r\nmussels. Moorhens swam in and out among the rushes, water-rats nibbled\r\nat the flags, pikes basked at the edge of the weeds, summer-snipes ran\r\nalong the sand, and doubtless an otter here and there was in\r\nconcealment. Without the line of the shoals and islets, now that the\r\nmallards had flown, there was a solitude of water. It was far too deep\r\nfor the longest weeds, nothing seemed to exist here. The very\r\nwater-snails seek the shore, or are drifted by the currents into shallow\r\ncorners. Neither great nor little care for the broad expanse.\r\n\r\nThe canoe moved more rapidly as the wind came now with its full force\r\nover the distant woods and hills, and though it was but a light\r\nsoutherly breeze, the broad sail impelled the taper vessel swiftly.\r\nReclining in the stern, Felix lost all consciousness of aught but that\r\nhe was pleasantly borne along. His eyes were not closed, and he was\r\naware of the canoe, the Lake, the sunshine, and the sky, and yet he was\r\nasleep. Physically awake, he mentally slumbered. It was rest. After the\r\nmisery, exertion, and excitement of the last fortnight it was rest,\r\nintense rest for body and mind. The pressure of the water against the\r\nhandle of the rudder-paddle, the slight vibration of the wood, as the\r\nbubbles rushed by beneath, alone perhaps kept him from really falling\r\nasleep. This was something which could not be left to itself; it must be\r\nfirmly grasped, and that effort restrained his drowsiness.\r\n\r\nThree hours passed. The shore was twelve or fifteen miles behind, and\r\nlooked like a blue cloud, for the summer haze hid the hills, more than\r\nwould have been the case in clearer weather.\r\n\r\nAnother hour, and at last Felix, awakening from his slumberous\r\ncondition, looked round and saw nothing but the waves. The shore he had\r\nleft had entirely disappeared, gone down; if there were land more lofty\r\non either hand, the haze concealed it. He looked again; he could\r\nscarcely comprehend it. He knew the Lake was very wide, but it had never\r\noccurred to him that he might possibly sail out of sight of land. This,\r\nthen was why the mariners would not quit the islands; they feared the\r\nopen water. He stood up and swept the horizon carefully, shading his\r\neyes with his hand; there was nothing but a mist at the horizon. He was\r\nalone with the sun, the sky, and the Lake. He could not surely have\r\nsailed into the ocean without knowing it? He sat down, dipped his hand\r\noverboard and tasted the drops that adhered; the water was pure and\r\nsweet, warm from the summer sunshine.\r\n\r\nThere was not so much as a swift in the upper sky; nothing but slender\r\nfilaments of white cloud. No swallows glided over the surface of the\r\nwater. If there were fishes he could not see them through the waves,\r\nwhich were here much larger; sufficiently large, though the wind was\r\nlight, to make his canoe rise and fall with their regular rolling. To\r\nsee fishes a calm surface is necessary, and, like other creatures, they\r\nhaunt the shallows and the shore. Never had he felt alone like this in\r\nthe depths of the farthest forest he had penetrated. Had he contemplated\r\nbeforehand the possibility of passing out of sight of land, when he\r\nfound that the canoe had arrived he would probably have been alarmed and\r\nanxious for his safety. But thus stumbling drowsily into the solitude of\r\nthe vast Lake, he was so astounded with his own discovery, so absorbed\r\nin thinking of the immense expanse, that the idea of danger did not\r\noccur to him.\r\n\r\nAnother hour passed, and he now began to gaze about him more eagerly for\r\nsome sight of land, for he had very little provision with him, and he\r\ndid not wish to spend the night upon the Lake. Presently, however, the\r\nmist on the horizon ahead appeared to thicken, and then became blue, and\r\nin a shorter time than he expected land came in sight. This arose from\r\nthe fact of its being low, so that he had approached nearer than he knew\r\nbefore recognising it. At the time when he was really out of sight of\r\nthe coast, he was much further from the hilly land left behind than from\r\nthe low country in front, and not in the mathematical centre, as he had\r\nsupposed, of the Lake. As it rose and came more into sight, he already\r\nbegan to wonder what reception he should meet with from the inhabitants,\r\nand whether he should find them as hard of heart as the people he had\r\njust escaped from. Should he, indeed, venture among them at all? Or\r\nshould he remain in the woods till he had observed more of their ways\r\nand manners? These questions were being debated in his mind, when he\r\nperceived that the wind was falling.\r\n\r\nAs the sun went past the meridian the breeze fell, till, in the hottest\r\npart of the afternoon, and when he judged that he was not more than\r\neight miles from shore, it sank to the merest zephyr, and the waves by\r\ndegrees diminished. So faint became the breeze in half-an-hour's time,\r\nand so intermittent, that he found it patience wasted even to hold the\r\nrudder-paddle. The sail hung and was no longer bellied out; as the idle\r\nwaves rolled under, it flapped against the mast. The heat was now so\r\nintolerable, the light reflected from the water increasing the\r\nsensation, that he was obliged to make himself some shelter by partly\r\nlowering the sail, and hauling the yard athwart the vessel, so that the\r\ncanvas acted as an awning. Gradually the waves declined in volume, and\r\nthe gentle breathing of the wind ebbed away, till at last the surface\r\nwas almost still, and he could feel no perceptible air stirring.\r\n\r\nWeary of sitting in the narrow boat, he stood up, but he could not\r\nstretch himself sufficiently for the change to be of much use. The long\r\nsummer day, previously so pleasant, now appeared scarcely endurable.\r\nUpon the silent water the time lingered, for there was nothing to mark\r\nits advance, not so much as a shadow beyond that of his own boat. The\r\nwaves having now no crest, went under the canoe without chafing against\r\nit, or rebounding, so that they were noiseless. No fishes rose to the\r\nsurface. There was nothing living near, except a blue butterfly, which\r\nsettled on the mast, having ventured thus far from land. The vastness of\r\nthe sky, over-arching the broad water, the sun, and the motionless\r\nfilaments of cloud, gave no repose for his gaze, for they were seemingly\r\nstill. To the weary gaze motion is repose; the waving boughs, the\r\nfoam-tipped waves, afford positive rest to look at. Such intense\r\nstillness as this of the summer sky was oppressive; it was like living\r\nin space itself, in the ether above. He welcomed at last the gradual\r\ndownward direction of the sun, for, as the heat decreased, he could work\r\nwith the paddle.\r\n\r\nPresently he furled the sail, took his paddle, and set his face for the\r\nland. He laboured steadily, but made no apparent progress. The canoe was\r\nheavy, and the outrigger or beam, which was of material use in sailing,\r\nwas a drawback to paddling. He worked till his arms grew weary, and\r\nstill the blue land seemed as far off as ever.\r\n\r\nBut by the time the sun began to approach the horizon, his efforts had\r\nproduced some effect, the shore was visible, and the woods beyond. They\r\nwere still five miles distant, and he was tired; there was little chance\r\nof his reaching it before night. He put his paddle down for refreshment\r\nand rest, and while he was thus engaged, a change took place. A faint\r\npuff of air came; a second, and a third; a tiny ripple ran along the\r\nsurface. Now he recollected that he had heard that the mariners depended\r\na great deal on the morning and the evening--the land and the\r\nLake--breeze as they worked along the shore. This was the first breath\r\nof the Land breeze. It freshened after a while, and he re-set his sail.\r\n\r\nAn hour or so afterwards he came near the shore; he heard the thrushes\r\nsinging, and the cuckoo calling, long before he landed. He did not stay\r\nto search about for a creek, but ran the canoe on the strand, which was\r\nfree of reeds or flags, a sign that the waves often beat furiously\r\nthere, rolling as they must for so many miles. He hauled the canoe up as\r\nhigh as he could, but presently when he looked about him he found that\r\nhe was on a small and narrow island, with a channel in the rear. Tired\r\nas he was, yet anxious for the safety of his canoe, he pushed off again,\r\nand paddled round and again beached her with the island between her and\r\nthe open Lake. Else he feared if a south wind should blow she might be\r\nbroken to pieces on the strand before his eyes. It was prudent to take\r\nthe precaution, but, as it happened, the next day the Lake was still.\r\n\r\nHe could see no traces of human occupation upon the island, which was of\r\nsmall extent and nearly bare, and therefore, in the morning, paddled\r\nacross the channel to the mainland, as he thought. But upon exploring\r\nthe opposite shore, it proved not to be the mainland, but merely another\r\nisland. Paddling round it, he tried again, but with the same result; he\r\nfound nothing but island after island, all narrow, and bearing nothing\r\nexcept bushes. Observing a channel which seemed to go straight in among\r\nthese islets, he resolved to follow it, and did so (resting at\r\nnoon-time) the whole morning. As he paddled slowly in, he found the\r\nwater shallower, and weeds, bulrushes, and reeds became thick, except\r\nquite in the centre.\r\n\r\nAfter the heat of midday had gone over, he resumed his voyage, and still\r\nfound the same; islets and banks, more or less covered with hawthorn\r\nbushes, willow, elder, and alder, succeeded to islets, fringed round\r\ntheir edges with reeds and reed canary-grass. When he grew weary of\r\npaddling, he landed and stayed the night; the next day he went on again,\r\nand still for hour after hour rowed in and out among these banks and\r\nislets, till he began to think he should never find his way out.\r\n\r\nThe farther he penetrated the more numerous became the waterfowl. Ducks\r\nswam among the flags, or rose with a rush and splashing. Coots and\r\nmoorhens dived and hid in the reeds. The lesser grebe sank at the sound\r\nof the paddle like a stone. A strong northern diver raised a wave as he\r\nhurried away under the water, his course marked by the undulation above\r\nhim. Sedge-birds chirped in the willows; black-headed buntings sat on\r\nthe trees, and watched him without fear. Bearded titmice were there,\r\nclinging to the stalks of the sedges, and long-necked herons rose from\r\nthe reedy places where they love to wade. Blue dragon-flies darted to\r\nand fro, or sat on water-plants as if they were flowers. Snakes swam\r\nacross the channels, vibrating their heads from side to side. Swallows\r\nswept over his head. Pike \"struck\" from the verge of the thick weeds as\r\nhe came near. Perch rose for insects as they fell helpless into the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nHe noticed that the water, though so thick with reeds, was as clear as\r\nthat in the open Lake; there was no scum such as accumulates in stagnant\r\nplaces. From this he concluded that there must be a current, however\r\nslight, perhaps from rivers flowing into this part of the Lake. He felt\r\nthe strongest desire to explore farther till he reached the mainland,\r\nbut he reflected that mere exploration was not his object; it would\r\nnever obtain Aurora for him. There were no signs whatever of human\r\nhabitation, and from reeds and bulrushes, however interesting, nothing\r\ncould be gained. Reluctantly, therefore, on the third morning, having\r\npassed the night on one of the islets, he turned his canoe, and paddled\r\nsouthwards towards the Lake.\r\n\r\nHe did not for a moment attempt to retrace the channel by which he had\r\nentered; it would have been an impossibility; he took advantage of any\r\nclear space to push through. It took him as long to get out as it had to\r\nget in; it was the afternoon of the fourth day when he at last regained\r\nthe coast. He rested the remainder of the afternoon, wishing to start\r\nfresh in the morning, having determined to follow the line of the shore\r\neastwards, and so gradually to circumnavigate the Lake. If he succeeded\r\nin nothing else, that at least would be something to relate to Aurora.\r\n\r\nThe morning rose fair and bright, with a south-westerly air rather than\r\na breeze. He sailed before it; it was so light that his progress could\r\nnot have exceeded more than three miles an hour. Hour after hour passed\r\naway, and still he followed the line of the shore, now going a short way\r\nout to skirt an island, and now nearer it to pass between sandbanks. By\r\nnoon he was so weary of sitting in the canoe that he ran her ashore, and\r\nrested awhile.\r\n\r\nIt was the very height of the heat of the day when he set forth again,\r\nand the wind lighter than in the morning. It had, however, changed a\r\nlittle, and blew now from the west, almost too exactly abaft to suit his\r\ncraft. He could not make a map while sailing, or observe his position\r\naccurately, but it appeared to him that the shore trended towards the\r\nsouth-east, so that he was gradually turning an arc. He supposed from\r\nthis that he must be approaching the eastern end of the Lake. The water\r\nseemed shallower, to judge from the quantity of weeds. Now and then he\r\ncaught glimpses between the numerous islands of the open Lake, and\r\nthere, too, the weeds covered the surface in many places.\r\n\r\nIn an hour or two the breeze increased considerably, and travelling so\r\nmuch quicker, he found it required all his dexterity to steer past the\r\nislands and clear the banks upon which he was drifting. Once or twice he\r\ngrazed the willows that overhung the water, and heard the keel of the\r\ncanoe drag on the bottom. As much as possible he bore away from the\r\nmainland, steering south-east, thinking to find deeper water, and to be\r\nfree of the islets. He succeeded in the first, but the islets were now\r\nso numerous that he could not tell where the open Lake was. The farther\r\nthe afternoon advanced, the more the breeze freshened, till\r\noccasionally, as it blew between the islands, it struck his mast almost\r\nwith the force of a gale. Felix welcomed the wind, which would enable\r\nhim to make great progress before evening. If such favouring breezes\r\nwould continue, he could circumnavigate the waters in a comparatively\r\nshort time, and might return to Aurora, so far, at least, successful.\r\nHope filled his heart, and he sang to the wind.\r\n\r\nThe waves could not rise among these islands, which intercepted them\r\nbefore they could roll far enough to gather force, so that he had all\r\nthe advantage of the gale without its risks. Except a light haze all\r\nround the horizon, the sky was perfectly clear, and it was pleasant now\r\nthe strong current of air cooled the sun's heat. As he came round the\r\nislands he constantly met and disturbed parties of waterfowl, mallards,\r\nand coots. Sometimes they merely hid in the weeds, sometimes they rose,\r\nand when they did so passed to his rear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nDISCOVERIES\r\n\r\n\r\nThis little circumstance of the mallards always flying over him and away\r\nbehind, when flushed, presently made Felix speculate on the cause, and\r\nhe kept a closer watch. He now saw (what had, indeed, been going on for\r\nsome time) that there was a ceaseless stream of waterfowl, mallards,\r\nducks, coots, moorhens, and lesser grebes coming towards him, swimming\r\nto the westward. As they met him they parted and let him through, or\r\nrose and went over. Next he noticed that the small birds on the islands\r\nwere also travelling in the same direction, that is against the wind.\r\nThey did not seem in any haste, but flitted from islet to islet, bush to\r\ntree, feeding and gossiping as they went; still the movement was\r\ndistinct.\r\n\r\nFinches, linnets, blackbirds, thrushes, wrens, and whitethroats, and\r\nmany others, all passed him, and he could see the same thing going on to\r\nhis right and left. Felix became much interested in this migration, all\r\nthe more singular as it was the nesting-time, and hundreds of these\r\nbirds must have left their nests with eggs or young behind them. Nothing\r\nthat he could think of offered an adequate explanation. He imagined he\r\nsaw shoals of fishes going the same way, but the surface of the water\r\nbeing ruffled, and the canoe sailing rapidly, he could not be certain.\r\nAbout an hour after he first observed the migration the stream of birds\r\nceased suddenly.\r\n\r\nThere were no waterfowls in the water, and no finches in the bushes.\r\nThey had evidently all passed. Those in the van of the migratory army\r\nwere no doubt scattered and thinly distributed, so that he had been\r\nmeeting the flocks a long while before he suspected it. The nearer he\r\napproached their centre the thicker they became, and on getting through\r\nthat he found a solitude. The weeds were thicker than ever, so that he\r\nhad constantly to edge away from where he supposed the mainland to lie.\r\nBut there were no waterfowls and no birds on the islets. Suddenly as he\r\nrounded a large island he saw what for the moment he imagined to be a\r\nline of white surf, but the next instant he recognised a solid mass, as\r\nit were, of swallows and martins flying just over the surface of the\r\nwater straight towards him. He had no time to notice how far they\r\nextended before they had gone by him with a rushing sound. Turning to\r\nlook back, he saw them continue directly west in the teeth of the wind.\r\n\r\nLike the water and the islands, the sky was now cleared of birds, and\r\nnot a swallow remained. Felix asked himself if he were running into some\r\nunknown danger, but he could not conceive any. The only thing that\r\noccurred to him was the possibility of the wind rising to a hurricane;\r\nthat gave him no alarm, because the numerous islands would afford\r\nshelter. So complete was the shelter in some places, that as he passed\r\nalong his sail drew above, while the surface of the water, almost\r\nsurrounded with bushes and willows, was smooth. No matter to how many\r\nquarters of the compass the wind might veer, he should still be able to\r\nget under the lee of one or other of the banks.\r\n\r\nThe sky remained without clouds; there was nothing but a slight haze,\r\nwhich he sometimes fancied looked thicker in front or to the eastward.\r\nThere was nothing whatever to cause the least uneasiness; on the\r\ncontrary, his curiosity was aroused, and he was desirous of discovering\r\nwhat it was that had startled the birds. After a while the water became\r\nrather more open, with sandbanks instead of islands, so that he could\r\nsee around him for a considerable distance. By a large bank, behind\r\nwhich the ripple was stilled, he saw a low wave advancing towards him,\r\nand moving against the wind. It was followed by two others at short\r\nintervals, and though he could not see them, he had no doubt shoals of\r\nfishes were passing and had raised the undulations.\r\n\r\nThe sedges on the sandbanks appeared brown and withered, as if it had\r\nbeen autumn instead of early summer. The flags were brown at the tip,\r\nand the aquatic grasses had dwindled. They looked as if they could not\r\ngrow, and had reached but half their natural height. From the low\r\nwillows the leaves were dropping, faded and yellow, and the thorn bushes\r\nwere shrivelled and covered with the white cocoons of caterpillars. The\r\nfarther he sailed the more desolate the banks seemed, and trees ceased\r\naltogether. Even the willows were fewer and stunted, and the highest\r\nthorn bush was not above his chest. His vessel was now more exposed to\r\nthe wind, so that he drove past the banks and scattered islands rapidly,\r\nand he noticed that there was not so much as a crow on them. Upturned\r\nmussel-shells, glittering in the sunshine, showed where crows had been\r\nat work, but there was not one now visible.\r\n\r\nFelix thought that the water had lost its clearness and had become\r\nthick, which he put down to the action of the wavelets disturbing the\r\nsand in the shallows. Ahead the haze, or mist, was now much thicker, and\r\nwas apparently not over a mile distant. It hid the islands and concealed\r\neverything. He expected to enter it immediately, but it receded as he\r\napproached. Along the strand of an island he passed there was a dark\r\nline like a stain, and in still water under the lee the surface was\r\ncovered with a floating scum. Felix, on seeing this, at once concluded\r\nthat he had unknowingly entered a gulf, and had left the main Lake, for\r\nthe only place he had ever seen scum before was at the extremity of a\r\ncreek near home, where the water was partly stagnant on a marshy level.\r\nThe water of the Lake was proverbial for its purity and clearness.\r\n\r\nHe kept, therefore, a sharp look-out, expecting every moment to sight\r\nthe end of the gulf or creek in which he supposed himself sailing, so\r\nthat he might be ready to lower his sail. By degrees the wind had risen\r\ntill it now blew with fury, but the numerous sandflats so broke up the\r\nwaves that he found no inconvenience from them. One solitary gull passed\r\nover at a great height, flying steadily westwards against the wind. The\r\ncanoe now began to overtake fragments of scum drifting before the wind,\r\nand rising up and down on the ripples. Once he saw a broad piece rise to\r\nthe surface together with a quantity of bubbles. None of the sandbanks\r\nnow rose more than a foot or so above the surface, and were entirely\r\nbare, mere sand and gravel.\r\n\r\nThe mist ahead was sensibly nearer, and yet it eluded him; it was of a\r\nfaint yellow, and though so thin, obscured everything where it hovered.\r\nFrom out of the mist there presently appeared a vast stretch of weeds.\r\nThey floated on the surface and undulated to the wavelets, a pale\r\nyellowish green expanse. Felix was hesitating whether to lower his sail\r\nor attempt to drive over them, when, as he advanced and the mist\r\nretreated, he saw open water beyond. The weeds extended on either hand\r\nas far as he could see, but they were only a narrow band, and he\r\nhesitated no longer. He felt the canoe graze the bottom once as he\r\nsailed over the weeds. The water was free of sandbanks beyond them, but\r\nhe could see large islands looming in several directions.\r\n\r\nGlancing behind him he perceived that the faint yellow mist had closed\r\nin and now encircled him. It came with two or three hundred yards, and\r\nwas not affected by the wind, rough as it was. Quite suddenly he noticed\r\nthat the water on which the canoe floated was black. The wavelets which\r\nrolled alongside were black, and the slight spray that occasionally flew\r\non board was black, and stained the side of the vessel. This greatly\r\nastonished and almost shocked him; it was so opposite and contrary to\r\nall his ideas about the Lake, the very mirror of purity. He leant over,\r\nand dipped up a little in the palm of his hand; it did not appear black\r\nin such a small quantity, it seemed a rusty brown, but he became aware\r\nof an offensive odour. The odour clung to his hand, and he could not\r\nremove it, to his great disgust. It was like nothing he had ever smelt\r\nbefore, and not in the least like the vapour of marshes.\r\n\r\nBy now being some distance from any island, the wavelets increased in\r\nsize, and spray flew on board, wetting everything with this black\r\nliquid. Instead of level marshes and the end of the gulf, it appeared as\r\nif the water were deep, and also as if it widened. Exposed to the full\r\npress of the gale, Felix began to fear that he should not be able to\r\nreturn very easily against it. He did not know what to do. The horrid\r\nblackness of the water disposed him to turn about and tack out; on the\r\nother hand, having set out on a voyage of discovery, and having now\r\nfound something different to the other parts of the Lake, he did not\r\nlike to retreat. He sailed on, thinking to presently pass these\r\nloathsome waters.\r\n\r\nHe was now hungry, and indeed thirsty, but was unable to drink because\r\nhe had no water-barrel. No vessel sailing on the Lake ever carried a\r\nwater-barrel, since such pure water was always under their bows. He was\r\ncramped, too, with long sitting in the canoe, and the sun was\r\nperceptibly sloping in the west. He determined to land and rest, and\r\nwith this purpose steered to the right under the lee of a large island,\r\nso large, indeed, that he was not certain it was not part of the\r\nmainland or one side of the gulf. The water was very deep close up to\r\nthe shore, but, to his annoyance, the strand appeared black, as if\r\nsoaked with the dark water. He skirted along somewhat farther, and found\r\na ledge of low rocks stretching out into the Lake, so that he was\r\nobliged to run ashore before coming to these.\r\n\r\nOn landing, the black strand, to his relief, was fairly firm, for he had\r\ndreaded sinking to the knees in it; but its appearance was so unpleasant\r\nthat he could not bring himself to sit down. He walked on towards the\r\nledge of rocks, thinking to find a pleasanter place there. They were\r\nstratified, and he stepped on them to climb up, when his foot went deep\r\ninto the apparently hard rock. He kicked it, and his shoe penetrated it\r\nas if it had been soft sand. It was impossible to climb up the reef. The\r\nground rose inland, and curious to see around him as far as possible, he\r\nascended the slope.\r\n\r\nFrom the summit, however, he could not see farther than on the shore,\r\nfor the pale yellow mist rose up round him, and hid the canoe on the\r\nstrand. The extreme desolation of the dark and barren ground repelled\r\nhim; there was not a tree, bush, or living creature, not so much as a\r\nbuzzing fly. He turned to go down, and then for the first time noticed\r\nthat the disk of the sun was surrounded with a faint blue rim,\r\napparently caused by the yellow vapour. So much were the rays shorn of\r\ntheir glare, that he could look at the sun without any distress, but its\r\nheat seemed to have increased, though it was now late in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nDescending towards the canoe, he fancied the wind had veered\r\nconsiderably. He sat down in the boat, and took some food; it was\r\nwithout relish, as he had nothing to drink, and the great heat had tired\r\nhim. Wearily, and without thinking, he pushed off the canoe; she slowly\r\nfloated out, when, as he was about to hoist up the sail, a tremendous\r\ngust of wind struck him down on the thwarts, and nearly carried him\r\noverboard. He caught the mast as he fell, or over he must have gone into\r\nthe black waves. Before he could recover himself, she drifted against\r\nthe ledge of rocks, which broke down and sank before the bow, so that\r\nshe passed over uninjured.\r\n\r\nFelix got out a paddle, and directed the canoe as well as he could; the\r\nfury of the wind was irresistible, and he could only drive before it. In\r\na few minutes, as he was swept along the shore, he was carried between\r\nit and another immense reef. Here, the waves being broken and less\r\npowerful, he contrived to get the heavy canoe ashore again, and, jumping\r\nout, dragged her up as far as he could on the land. When he had done\r\nthis, he found to his surprise that the gale had ceased. The tremendous\r\nburst of wind had been succeeded by a perfect calm, and the waves had\r\nalready lost their violent impetus.\r\n\r\nThis was a relief, for he had feared that the canoe would be utterly\r\nbroken to pieces; but soon he began to doubt if it were an unmixed\r\nbenefit, as without a wind he could not move from this dismal place that\r\nevening. He was too weary to paddle far. He sat on the canoe to rest\r\nhimself, and, whether from fatigue or other causes, fell asleep. His\r\nhead heavily dropping on his chest partly woke him several times, but\r\nhis lassitude overcame the discomfort, and he slept on. When he got up\r\nhe felt dazed and unrefreshed, as if sleeping had been hard work. He was\r\nextremely thirsty, and oppressed with the increasing heat. The sun had\r\nsunk, or rather was so low that the high ground hid it from sight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nSTRANGE THINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe thought struck Felix that perhaps he might find a spring somewhere\r\nin the island, and he started at once up over the hill. At the top he\r\npaused. The sun had not sunk, but had disappeared as a disk. In its\r\nplace was a billow of blood, for so it looked, a vast up-heaved billow\r\nof glowing blood surging on the horizon. Over it flickered a tint of\r\npalest blue, like that seen in fire. The black waters reflected the\r\nglow, and the yellow vapour around was suffused with it. Though\r\nmomentarily startled, Felix did not much heed these appearances; he was\r\nstill dazed and heavy from his sleep.\r\n\r\nHe went on, looking for a spring, sometimes walking on firm ground,\r\nsometimes sinking to the ankle in a friable soil like black sand. The\r\nground looked, indeed, as if it had been burnt, but there were no\r\ncharred stumps of timber such as he had seen on the sites of forest\r\nfires. The extreme dreariness seemed to oppress his spirits, and he went\r\non and on in a heavy waking dream. Descending into a plain, he lost\r\nsight of the flaming sunset and the black waters. In the level plain the\r\ndesolation was yet more marked; there was not a grass-blade or plant;\r\nthe surface was hard, black, and burned, resembling iron, and indeed in\r\nplaces it resounded to his feet, though he supposed that was the echo\r\nfrom hollow passages beneath.\r\n\r\nSeveral times he shook himself, straightened himself up, and endeavoured\r\nto throw off the sense of drowsy weight which increased upon him. He\r\ncould not do so; he walked with bent back, and crept, as it were, over\r\nthe iron land which radiated heat. A shimmer like that of water appeared\r\nin front; he quickened his pace, but could not get to it, and realized\r\npresently that it was a mirage which receded as he advanced. There was\r\nno pleasant summer twilight; the sunset was succeeded by an indefinite\r\ngloom, and while this shadow hung overhead the yellow vapour around was\r\nfaintly radiant. Felix suddenly stopped, having stepped, as he thought,\r\non a skeleton.\r\n\r\nAnother glance, however, showed that it was merely the impression of\r\none, the actual bones had long since disappeared. The ribs, the skull,\r\nand limbs were drawn on the black ground in white lines as if it had\r\nbeen done with a broad piece of chalk. Close by he found three or four\r\nmore, intertangled and superimposed as if the unhappy beings had fallen\r\npartly across each other, and in that position had mouldered away\r\nleaving nothing but their outline. From among a variety of objects that\r\nwere scattered about Felix picked up something that shone; it was a\r\ndiamond bracelet of one large stone, and a small square of blue china\r\ntile with a curious heraldic animal drawn on it. Evidently these had\r\nbelonged to one or other of the party who had perished.\r\n\r\nThough startled at the first sight, it was curious that Felix felt so\r\nlittle horror; the idea did not occur to him that he was in danger as\r\nthese had been. Inhaling the gaseous emanations from the soil and\r\ncontained in the yellow vapour, he had become narcotized, and moved as\r\nif under the influence of opium, while wide awake, and capable of\r\nrational conduct. His senses were deadened, and did not carry the usual\r\nvivid impression to the mind; he saw things as if they were afar off.\r\nAccidentally looking back, he found that his footmarks, as far as he\r\ncould see, shone with a phosphoric light like that of \"touchwood\" in the\r\ndark. Near at hand they did not shine; the appearance did not come till\r\nsome few minutes had elapsed. His track was visible behind till the\r\nvapour hid it. As the evening drew on the vapour became more luminous,\r\nand somewhat resembled an aurora.\r\n\r\nStill anxious for water, he proceeded as straight ahead as he could, and\r\nshortly became conscious of an indefinite cloud which kept pace with him\r\non either side. When he turned to look at either of the clouds, the one\r\nlooked at disappeared. It was not condensed enough to be visible to\r\ndirect vision, yet he was aware of it from the corner of his eye.\r\nShapeless and threatening, the gloomy thickness of the air floated\r\nbeside him like the vague monster of a dream. Sometimes he fancied that\r\nhe saw an arm or a limb among the folds of the cloud, or an approach to\r\na face; the instant he looked it vanished. Marching at each hand these\r\nvapours bore him horrible company.\r\n\r\nHis brain became unsteady, and flickering things moved about him; yet,\r\nthough alarmed, he was not afraid; his senses were not acute enough for\r\nfear. The heat increased; his hands were intolerably hot as if he had\r\nbeen in a fever, he panted; but did not perspire. A dry heat like an\r\noven burned his blood in his veins. His head felt enlarged, and his eyes\r\nseemed alight; he could see these two globes of phosphoric light under\r\nhis brows. They seemed to stand out so that he could see them. He\r\nthought his path straight, it was really curved; nor did he know that he\r\nstaggered as he walked.\r\n\r\nPresently a white object appeared ahead; and on coming to it, he found\r\nit was a wall, white as snow, with some kind of crystal. He touched it,\r\nwhen the wall fell immediately, with a crushing sound as if pulverised,\r\nand disappeared in a vast cavern at his feet. Beyond this chasm he came\r\nto more walls like those of houses, such as would be left if the roofs\r\nfell in. He carefully avoided touching them, for they seemed as brittle\r\nas glass, and merely a white powder having no consistency at all. As he\r\nadvanced these remnants of buildings increased in number, so that he had\r\nto wind in and out round them. In some places the crystallized wall had\r\nfallen of itself, and he could see down into the cavern; for the house\r\nhad either been built partly underground, or, which was more probable,\r\nthe ground had risen. Whether the walls had been of bricks or stone or\r\nother material he could not tell; they were now like salt.\r\n\r\nSoon wearying of winding round these walls, Felix returned and retraced\r\nhis steps till he was outside the place, and then went on towards the\r\nleft. Not long after, as he still walked in a dream and without feeling\r\nhis feet, he descended a slight slope and found the ground change in\r\ncolour from black to a dull red. In his dazed state he had taken several\r\nsteps into this red before he noticed that it was liquid, unctuous and\r\nslimy, like a thick oil. It deepened rapidly and was already over his\r\nshoes; he returned to the black shore and stood looking out over the\r\nwater, if such it could be called.\r\n\r\nThe luminous yellow vapour had now risen a height of ten or fifteen\r\nfeet, and formed a roof both over the land and over the red water, under\r\nwhich it was possible to see for a great distance. The surface of the\r\nred oil or viscid liquid was perfectly smooth, and, indeed, it did not\r\nseem as if any wind could rouse a wave on it, much less that a swell\r\nshould be left after the gale had gone down. Disappointed in his search\r\nfor water to drink, Felix mechanically turned to go back.\r\n\r\nHe followed his luminous footmarks, which he could see a long way before\r\nhim. His trail curved so much that he made many short cuts across the\r\nwinding line he had left. His weariness was now so intense that all\r\nfeeling had departed. His feet, his limbs, his arms, and hands were\r\nnumbed. The subtle poison of the emanations from the earth had begun to\r\ndeaden his nerves. It seemed a full hour or more to him till he reached\r\nthe spot where the skeletons were drawn in white upon the ground.\r\n\r\nHe passed a few yards to one side of them, and stumbled over a heap of\r\nsomething which he did not observe, as it was black like the level\r\nground. It emitted a metallic sound, and looking he saw that he had\r\nkicked his foot against a great heap of money. The coins were black as\r\nink; he picked up a handful and went on. Hitherto Felix had accepted all\r\nthat he saw as something so strange as to be unaccountable. During his\r\nadvance into this region in the canoe he had in fact become slowly\r\nstupefied by the poisonous vapour he had inhaled. His mind was partly in\r\nabeyance; it acted, but only after some time had elapsed. He now at last\r\nbegan to realize his position; the finding of the heap of blackened\r\nmoney touched a chord of memory. These skeletons were the miserable\r\nrelics of men who had ventured, in search of ancient treasures, into the\r\ndeadly marshes over the site of the mightiest city of former days. The\r\ndeserted and utterly extinct city of London was under his feet.\r\n\r\nHe had penetrated into the midst of that dreadful place, of which he had\r\nheard many a tradition: how the earth was poison, the water poison, the\r\nair poison, the very light of heaven, falling through such an\r\natmosphere, poison. There were said to be places where the earth was on\r\nfire and belched forth sulphurous fumes, supposed to be from the\r\ncombustion of the enormous stores of strange and unknown chemicals\r\ncollected by the wonderful people of those times. Upon the surface of\r\nthe water there was a greenish-yellow oil, to touch which was death to\r\nany creature; it was the very essence of corruption. Sometimes it\r\nfloated before the wind, and fragments became attached to reeds or flags\r\nfar from the place itself. If a moorhen or duck chanced to rub the reed,\r\nand but one drop stuck to its feathers, it forthwith died. Of the red\r\nwater he had not heard, nor of the black, into which he had unwittingly\r\nsailed.\r\n\r\nGhastly beings haunted the site of so many crimes, shapeless monsters,\r\nhovering by night, and weaving a fearful dance. Frequently they caught\r\nfire, as it seemed, and burned as they flew or floated in the air.\r\nRemembering these stories, which in part, at least, now seemed to be\r\ntrue, Felix glanced aside, where the cloud still kept pace with him, and\r\ninvoluntarily put his hands to his ears lest the darkness of the air\r\nshould whisper some horror of old times. The earth on which he walked,\r\nthe black earth, leaving phosphoric footmarks behind him, was composed\r\nof the mouldered bodies of millions of men who had passed away in the\r\ncenturies during which the city existed. He shuddered as he moved; he\r\nhastened, yet could not go fast, his numbed limbs would not permit him.\r\n\r\nHe dreaded lest he should fall and sleep, and wake no more, like the\r\nsearchers after treasure; treasure which they had found only to lose for\r\never. He looked around, supposing that he might see the gleaming head\r\nand shoulders of the half-buried giant, of which he recollected he had\r\nbeen told. The giant was punished for some crime by being buried to the\r\nchest in the earth; fire incessantly consumed his head and played about\r\nit, yet it was not destroyed. The learned thought, if such a thing\r\nreally existed, that it must be the upper part of an ancient brazen\r\nstatue, kept bright by the action of acid in the atmosphere, and shining\r\nwith reflected light. Felix did not see it, and shortly afterwards\r\nsurmounted the hill, and looked down upon his canoe. It was on fire!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nFIERY VAPOURS\r\n\r\n\r\nFelix tried to run, but his feet would not rise from the ground; his\r\nlimbs were numb as in a nightmare; he could not get there. His body\r\nwould not obey his will. In reality he did move, but more slowly than\r\nwhen he walked. By degrees approaching the canoe his alarm subsided, for\r\nalthough it burned it was not injured; the canvas of the sail was not\r\neven scorched. When he got to it the flames had disappeared; like\r\nJack-o'-the-lantern, the phosphoric fire receded from him. With all his\r\nstrength he strove to launch her, yet paused, for over the surface of\r\nthe black water, now smooth and waveless, played immense curling flames,\r\nstretching out like endless serpents, weaving, winding, rolling over\r\neach other. Suddenly they contracted into a ball, which shone with a\r\nsteady light, and was as large as the full moon. The ball swept along,\r\nrose a little, and from it flew out long streamers till it was unwound\r\nin fiery threads.\r\n\r\nBut remembering that the flames had not even scorched the canvas, he\r\npushed the canoe afloat, determined at any risk to leave this dreadful\r\nplace. To his joy he felt a faint air rising; it cooled his forehead,\r\nbut was not enough to fill the sail. He paddled with all the strength he\r\nhad left. The air seemed to come from exactly the opposite direction to\r\nwhat it had previously blown, some point of east he supposed. Labour as\r\nhard as he would, the canoe moved slowly, being so heavy. It seemed as\r\nif the black water was thick and clung to her, retarding motion. Still,\r\nhe did move, and in time (it seemed, indeed, a time) he left the island,\r\nwhich disappeared in the luminous vapours. Uncertain as to the\r\ndirection, he got his compass, but it would not act; the needle had no\r\nlife, it swung and came to rest, pointing any way as it chanced. It was\r\ndemagnetized. Felix resolved to trust to the wind, which he was certain\r\nblew from the opposite quarter, and would therefore carry him out. The\r\nstars he could not see for the vapour, which formed a roof above him.\r\n\r\nThe wind was rising, but in uncertain gusts; however, he hoisted the\r\nsail, and floated slowly before it. Nothing but excitement could have\r\nkept him awake. Reclining in the canoe, he watched the serpent-like\r\nflames playing over the surface, and forced himself by sheer power of\r\nwill not to sleep. The two dark clouds which had accompanied him to the\r\nshore now faded away, and the cooling wind enabled him to bear up better\r\nagainst his parching thirst. His hope was to reach the clear and\r\nbeautiful Lake; his dread that in the uncertain light he might strike a\r\nconcealed sandbank and become firmly fixed.\r\n\r\nTwice he passed islands, distinguishable as masses of visible darkness.\r\nWhile the twisted flames played up to the shore, and the luminous vapour\r\noverhung the ground, the island itself appeared as a black mass. The\r\nwind became by degrees steadier, and the canoe shot swiftly over the\r\nwater. His hopes rose; he sat up and kept a keener look-out ahead. All\r\nat once the canoe shook as if she had struck a rock. She vibrated from\r\none end to the other, and stopped for a moment in her course. Felix\r\nsprang up alarmed. At the same instant a bellowing noise reached him,\r\nsucceeded by a frightful belching and roaring, as if a volcano had burst\r\nforth under the surface of the water; he looked back but could see\r\nnothing. The canoe had not touched ground; she sailed as rapidly as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nAgain the shock, and again the hideous roaring, as if some force beneath\r\nthe water were forcing itself up, vast bubbles rising and turning.\r\nFortunately it was at a great distance. Hardly was it silent before it\r\nwas reiterated for the third time. Next Felix felt the canoe heave up,\r\nand he was aware that a large roller had passed under him. A second and\r\na third followed. They were without crests, and were not raised by the\r\nwind; they obviously started from the scene of the disturbance. Soon\r\nafterwards the canoe moved quicker, and he detected a strong current\r\nsetting in the direction he was sailing.\r\n\r\nThe noise did not recur, nor did any more rollers pass under. Felix felt\r\nbetter and less dazed, but his weariness and sleepiness increased every\r\nmoment. He fancied that the serpent flames were less brilliant and\r\nfarther apart, and that the luminous vapour was thinner. How long he sat\r\nat the rudder he could not tell; he noticed that it seemed to grow\r\ndarker, the serpent flames faded away, and the luminous vapour was\r\nsucceeded by something like the natural gloom of night. At last he saw a\r\nstar overhead, and hailed it with joy. He thought of Aurora; the next\r\ninstant he fell back in the canoe firm asleep.\r\n\r\nHis arm, however, still retained the rudder-paddle in position, so that\r\nthe canoe sped on with equal swiftness. She would have struck more than\r\none of the sandbanks and islets had it not been for the strong current\r\nthat was running. Instead of carrying her against the banks this warded\r\nher off, for it drew her between the islets in the channels where it ran\r\nfastest, and the undertow, where it struck the shore, bore her back from\r\nthe land. Driving before the wind, the canoe swept onward steadily to\r\nthe west. In an hour it had passed the line of the black water, and\r\nentered the sweet Lake. Another hour and all trace of the marshes had\r\nutterly disappeared, the last faint glow of the vapour had vanished. The\r\ndawn of the coming summer's day appeared, and the sky became a lovely\r\nazure. The canoe sailed on, but Felix remained immovable in slumber.\r\n\r\nLong since the strong current had ceased, it scarcely extended into the\r\nsweet waters, and the wind only impelled the canoe. As the sun rose the\r\nbreeze gradually fell away, and in an hour or so there was only a light\r\nair. The canoe had left most of the islets and was approaching the open\r\nLake when, as she passed almost the last, the yard caught the\r\noverhanging branch of a willow, the canoe swung round and grounded\r\ngently under the shadow of the tree. For some time the little wavelets\r\nbeat against the side of the boat; gradually they ceased, and the clear\r\nand beautiful water became still. Felix slept till nearly noon, when he\r\nawoke and sat up. At the sudden movement a pike struck, and two moorhens\r\nscuttled out of the water into the grass on the shore. A thrush was\r\nsinging sweetly, whitethroats were busy in the bushes, and swallows\r\nswept by overhead.\r\n\r\nFelix drew a long deep breath of intense relief; it was like awakening\r\nin Paradise. He snatched up a cup, dipped, and satisfied his craving\r\nthirst, then washed his hands over the side, and threw the water over\r\nhis face. But when he came to stand up and move, he found that his limbs\r\nwere almost powerless. Like a child he tottered, his joints had no\r\nstrength, his legs tingled as if they had been benumbed. He was so weak\r\nhe crawled on all fours along to the mast, furled the sail kneeling, and\r\ndragged himself rather than stepped ashore with the painter. The instant\r\nhe had fastened the rope to a branch, he threw himself at full length on\r\nthe grass, and grasped a handful of it. Merely to touch the grass after\r\nsuch an experience was intense delight.\r\n\r\nThe song of the thrush, the chatter of the whitethroats, the sight of a\r\nhedge-sparrow, gave him inexpressible pleasure. Lying on the sward he\r\nwatched the curves traced by the swallows in the sky. From the sedges\r\ncame the curious cry of the moorhen; a bright kingfisher went by. He\r\nrested as he had never rested before. His whole body, his whole being\r\nwas resigned to rest. It was fully two hours before he rose and crept on\r\nall fours into the canoe for food. There was only sufficient left for\r\none meal, but that gave him no concern now he was out of the marshes; he\r\ncould fish and use his crossbow.\r\n\r\nHe now observed what had escaped him during the night, the canoe was\r\nblack from end to end. Stem, stern, gunwale, thwart, outrigger, mast and\r\nsail were black. The stain did not come off on being touched, it seemed\r\nburnt in. As he leaned over the side to dip water, and saw his\r\nreflection, he started; his face was black, his clothes were black, his\r\nhair black. In his eagerness to drink, the first time, he had noticed\r\nnothing. His hands were less dark; contact with the paddle and ropes had\r\npartly rubbed it off, he supposed. He washed, but the water did not\r\nmaterially diminish the discoloration.\r\n\r\nAfter eating, he returned to the grass and rested again; and it was not\r\ntill the sun was sinking that he felt any return of vigour. Still weak,\r\nbut able now to walk, leaning on a stick, he began to make a camp for\r\nthe coming night. But a few scraps, the remnant of his former meal, were\r\nleft; on these he supped after a fashion, and long before the white owl\r\nbegan his rounds Felix was fast asleep on his hunter's hide from the\r\ncanoe. He found next morning that the island was small, only a few\r\nacres; it was well-wooded, dry, and sandy in places. He had little\r\ninclination or strength to resume his expedition; he erected a booth of\r\nbranches, and resolved to stay a few days till his strength returned.\r\n\r\nBy shooting wildfowl, and fishing, he fared very well, and soon\r\nrecovered. In two days the discoloration of the skin had faded to an\r\nolive tint, which, too, grew fainter. The canoe lost its blackness, and\r\nbecame a rusty colour. By rubbing the coins he had carried away he found\r\nthey were gold; part of the inscription remained, but he could not read\r\nit. The blue china-tile was less injured than the metal; after washing\r\nit, it was bright. But the diamond pleased him most; it would be a\r\nsplendid present for Aurora. Never had he seen anything like it in the\r\npalaces; he believe it was twice the size of the largest possessed by\r\nany king or prince.\r\n\r\nIt was as big as his finger-nail, and shone and gleamed in the sunlight,\r\nsparkling and reflecting the beams. Its value must be very great. But\r\nwell he knew how dangerous it would be to exhibit it; on some pretext or\r\nother he would be thrown into prison, and the gem seized. It must be\r\nhidden with the greatest care till he could produce it in Thyma Castle,\r\nwhen the Baron would protect it. Felix regretted now that he had not\r\nsearched further; perhaps he might have found other treasures for\r\nAurora; the next instant he repudiated his greed, and was only thankful\r\nthat he had escaped with his life. He wondered and marvelled that he had\r\ndone so, it was so well known that almost all who had ventured in had\r\nperished.\r\n\r\nReflecting on the circumstances which had accompanied his entrance to\r\nthe marshes, the migration of the birds seemed almost the most singular.\r\nThey were evidently flying from some apprehended danger, and that most\r\nprobably would be in the air. The gale at that time, however, was\r\nblowing in a direction which would appear to ensure safety to them;\r\ninto, and not out of, the poisonous marshes. Did they, then, foresee\r\nthat it would change? Did they expect it to veer like a cyclone and\r\npresently blow east with the same vigour as it then blew west? That\r\nwould carry the vapour from the inky waters out over the sweet Lake, and\r\nmight even cause the foul water itself to temporarily encroach on the\r\nsweet. The more he thought of it, the more he felt convinced that this\r\nwas the explanation; and, as a fact, the wind, after dropping, did arise\r\nagain and blow from the east, though, as it happened, not with nearly\r\nthe same strength. It fell, too, before long, fortunately for him.\r\nClearly the birds had anticipated a cyclone, and that the wind turning\r\nwould carry the gases out upon them to their destruction. They had\r\ntherefore hurried away, and the fishes had done the same.\r\n\r\nThe velocity of the gale which had carried him into the black waters had\r\nproved his safety, by driving before it the thicker and most poisonous\r\nportion of the vapour, compressing it towards the east, so that he had\r\nentered the dreaded precincts under favourable conditions. When it\r\ndropped, while he was on the black island, he soon began to feel the\r\neffect of the gases rising imperceptibly from the soil, and had he not\r\nhad the good fortune to escape so soon, no doubt he would have fallen a\r\nvictim. He could not congratulate himself sufficiently upon his good\r\nfortune. The other circumstances appeared to be due to the decay of the\r\nancient city, to the decomposition of accumulated matter, to\r\nphosphorescence and gaseous exhalations. The black rocks that crumbled\r\nat a touch were doubtless the remains of ancient buildings saturated\r\nwith the dark water and vapours. Inland similar remains were white, and\r\nresembled salt.\r\n\r\nBut the great explosions which occurred as he was leaving, and which\r\nsent heavy rollers after him, were not easily understood, till he\r\nremembered that in Sylvester's \"Book of Natural Things\" it was related\r\nthat \"the ancient city had been undermined with vast conduits, sewers,\r\nand tunnels, and that these communicated with the sea\". It had been much\r\ndisputed whether the sea did or did not still send its tides up to the\r\nsite of the old quays. Felix now thought that the explosions were due to\r\ncompressed air, or more probably to gases met with by the ascending\r\ntide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nTHE SHEPHERDS\r\n\r\n\r\nFor four days Felix remained on the island recovering his strength. By\r\ndegrees the memory of the scenes he had witnessed grew less vivid, and\r\nhis nerves regained their tone. The fifth morning he sailed again,\r\nmaking due south with a gentle breeze from the west, which suited the\r\ncanoe very well. He considered that he was now at the eastern extremity\r\nof the Lake, and that by sailing south he should presently reach the\r\nplace where the shore turned to the east again. The sharp prow of the\r\ncanoe cut swiftly through the waves, a light spray flew occasionally in\r\nhis face, and the wind blew pleasantly. In the cloudless sky swallows\r\nand swifts were wheeling, and on the water half a dozen mallards moved\r\naside to let him pass.\r\n\r\nAbout two hours after he started he encountered a mist, which came\r\nsoftly over the surface of the water with the wind, and in an instant\r\nshut out all view. Even the sun was scarcely visible. It was very warm,\r\nand left no moisture. In five minutes he passed through and emerged\r\nagain in the bright sunlight. These dry, warm mists are frequently seen\r\non the Lake in summer, and are believed to portend a continuance of fine\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nFelix kept a good distance from the mainland, which was hilly and\r\nwooded, and with few islands. Presently he observed in the extreme\r\ndistance, on his right hand, a line of mountainous hills, which he\r\nsupposed to be the southern shore of the Lake, and that he was sailing\r\ninto a gulf or bay. He debated with himself whether he should alter his\r\ncourse and work across to the mountains, or to continue to trace the\r\nshore. Unless he did trace the shore, he could scarcely say that he had\r\ncircumnavigated the Lake, as he would leave this great bay unexplored.\r\nHe continued, therefore, to sail directly south.\r\n\r\nThe wind freshened towards noon, and the canoe flew at a great pace.\r\nTwice he passed through similar mists. There were now no islands at all,\r\nbut a line of low chalk cliffs marked the shore. Considering that it\r\nmust be deep, and safe to do so, Felix bore in closer to look at the\r\nland. Woods ran along the hills right to the verge of the cliff, but he\r\nsaw no signs of inhabitants, no smoke, boat, or house. The sound of the\r\nsurf beating on the beach was audible, though the waves were not large.\r\nHigh over the cliff he noted a kite soaring, with forked tail, at a\r\ngreat height.\r\n\r\nImmediately afterwards he ran into another mist or vapour, thicker, if\r\nanything, and which quite obscured his view. It seemed like a great\r\ncloud on the surface of the water, and broader than those he had\r\npreviously entered. Suddenly the canoe stopped with a tremendous jerk,\r\nwhich pitched him forward on his knees, the mast cracked, and there was\r\na noise of splitting wood. As soon as he could get up, Felix saw, to his\r\nbitter sorrow, that the canoe had split longitudinally; the water came\r\nup through the split, and the boat was held together only by the beams\r\nof the outrigger. He had run aground on a large sharp flint embedded in\r\na chalk floor, which had split the poplar wood of the canoe like an axe.\r\nThe voyage was over, for the least strain would cause the canoe to part\r\nin two, and if she were washed off the ground she would be water-logged.\r\nIn half a minute the mist passed, leaving him in the bright day,\r\nshipwrecked.\r\n\r\nFelix now saw that the waters were white with suspended chalk, and\r\nsounding with the paddle, found that the depth was but a few inches. He\r\nhad driven at full speed on a reef. There was no danger, for the\r\ndistance to the shore was hardly two hundred yards, and judging by the\r\nappearance of the water, it was shallow all the way. But his canoe, the\r\nproduct of so much labour, and in which he had voyaged so far, his canoe\r\nwas destroyed. He could not repair her; he doubted whether it could have\r\nbeen done successfully even at home with Oliver to help him. He could\r\nsail no farther; there was nothing for it but to get ashore and travel\r\non foot. If the wind rose higher, the waves would soon break clean over\r\nher, and she would go to pieces.\r\n\r\nWith a heavy heart, Felix took his paddle and stepped overboard. Feeling\r\nwith the paddle, he plumbed the depth in front of him, and, as he\r\nexpected, walked all the way to the shore, no deeper than his knees.\r\nThis was fortunate, as it enabled him to convey his things to land\r\nwithout loss. He wrapped up the tools and manuscripts in one of his\r\nhunter's hides. When the whole cargo was landed, he sat down sorrowfully\r\nat the foot of the cliff, and looked out at the broken mast and sail,\r\nstill flapping uselessly in the breeze.\r\n\r\nIt was a long time before he recovered himself, and set to work\r\nmechanically to bury the crossbow, hunter's hides, tools, and\r\nmanuscripts, under a heap of pebbles. As the cliff, though low, was\r\nperpendicular, he could not scale it, else he would have preferred to\r\nconceal them in the woods above. To pile pebbles over them was the best\r\nhe could do for the present; he intended to return for them when he\r\ndiscovered a path up the cliff. He then started, taking only his bow and\r\narrows.\r\n\r\nBut no such path was to be found; he walked on and on till weary, and\r\nstill the cliff ran like a wall on his left hand. After an hour's rest,\r\nhe started again; and, as the sun was declining, came suddenly to a gap\r\nin the cliff, where a grassy sward came down to the shore. It was now\r\ntoo late, and he was too weary, to think of returning for his things\r\nthat evening. He made a scanty meal, and endeavoured to rest. But the\r\nexcitement of losing the canoe, the long march since, the lack of good\r\nfood, all tended to render him restless. Weary, he could not rest, nor\r\nmove farther. The time passed slowly, the sun sank, the wind ceased;\r\nafter an interminable time the stars appeared, and still he could not\r\nsleep. He had chosen a spot under an oak on the green slope. The night\r\nwas warm, and even sultry, so that he did not miss his covering, but\r\nthere was no rest in him. Towards the dawn, which comes very early at\r\nthat season, he at last slept, with his back to the tree. He awoke with\r\na start in broad daylight, to see a man standing in front of him armed\r\nwith a long spear.\r\n\r\nFelix sprang to his feet, instinctively feeling for his hunting-knife;\r\nbut he saw in an instant that no injury was meant, for the man was\r\nleaning on the shaft of his weapon, and, of course, could, if so he had\r\nwished, have run him through while sleeping. They looked at each other\r\nfor a moment. The stranger was clad in a tunic, and wore a hat of\r\nplaited straw. He was very tall and strongly built; his single weapon, a\r\nspear of twice his own length. His beard came down on his chest. He\r\nspoke to Felix in a dialect the latter did not understand. Felix held\r\nout his hand as a token of amity, which the other took. He spoke again.\r\nFelix, on his part, tried to explain his shipwreck, when a word the\r\nstranger uttered recalled to Felix's memory the peculiar dialect used by\r\nthe shepherd race on the hills in the neighbourhood of his home.\r\n\r\nHe spoke in this dialect, which the stranger in part at least\r\nunderstood, and the sound of which at once rendered him more friendly.\r\nBy degrees they comprehended each other's meaning the easier, as the\r\nshepherd had come the same way and had seen the wreck of the canoe.\r\nFelix learned that the shepherd was a scout sent on ahead to see that\r\nthe road was clear of enemies. His tribe were on the march with their\r\nflocks, and to avoid the steep woods and hills which there blocked their\r\ncourse, they had followed the level and open beach at the foot of the\r\ncliff, aware, of course, of the gap which Felix had found. While they\r\nwere talking, Felix saw the cloud of dust raised by the sheep as the\r\nflocks wound round a jutting buttress of cliff.\r\n\r\nHis friend explained that they marched in the night and early morning to\r\navoid the heat of the day. Their proposed halting-place was close at\r\nhand; he must go on and see that all was clear. Felix accompanied him,\r\nand found within the wood at the summit a grassy coombe, where a spring\r\nrose. The shepherd threw down his spear, and began to dam up the channel\r\nof the spring with stones, flints, and sods of earth, in order to form a\r\npool at which the sheep might drink. Felix assisted him, and the water\r\nspeedily began to rise.\r\n\r\nThe flocks were not allowed to rush tumultuously to the water; they came\r\nin about fifty at a time, each division with its shepherds and their\r\ndogs, so that confusion was avoided and all had their share. There were\r\nabout twenty of these divisions, besides eighty cows and a few goats.\r\nThey had no horses; their baggage came on the backs of asses.\r\n\r\nAfter the whole of the flocks and herds had been watered several fires\r\nwere lit by the women, who in stature and hardihood scarcely differed\r\nfrom the men. Not till this work was over did the others gather about\r\nFelix to hear his story. Finding that he was hungry they ran to the\r\nbaggage for food, and pressed on him a little dark bread, plentiful\r\ncheese and butter, dried tongue, and horns of mead. He could not devour\r\na fiftieth part of what these hospitable people brought him. Having\r\nnothing else to give them, he took from his pocket one of the gold coins\r\nhe had brought from the site of the ancient city, and offered it.\r\n\r\nThey laughed, and made him understand that it was of no value to them;\r\nbut they passed it from hand to hand, and he noticed that they began to\r\nlook at him curiously. From its blackened appearance they conjectured\r\nwhence he had obtained it; one, too, pointed to his shoes, which were\r\nstill blackened, and appeared to have been scorched. The whole camp now\r\npressed on him, their wonder and interest rising to a great height. With\r\nsome trouble Felix described his journey over the site of the ancient\r\ncity, interrupted with constant exclamations, questions, and excited\r\nconversation. He told them everything, except about the diamond.\r\n\r\nTheir manner towards him perceptibly altered. From the first they had\r\nbeen hospitable; they now became respectful, and even reverent. The\r\nelders and their chief, not to be distinguished by dress or ornament\r\nfrom the rest, treated him with ceremony and marked deference. The\r\nchildren were brought to see and even to touch him. So great was their\r\namazement that any one should have escaped from these pestilential\r\nvapours, that they attributed it to divine interposition, and looked\r\nupon him with some of the awe of superstition. He was asked to stay with\r\nthem altogether, and to take command of the tribe.\r\n\r\nThe latter Felix declined; to stay with them for awhile, at least, he\r\nwas, of course, willing enough. He mentioned his hidden possessions, and\r\ngot up to return for them, but they would not permit him. Two men\r\nstarted at once. He gave them the bearings of the spot, and they had not\r\nthe least doubt but that they should find it, especially as, the wind\r\nbeing still, the canoe would not yet have broken up, and would guide\r\nthem. The tribe remained in the green coombe the whole day, resting from\r\ntheir long journey. They wearied Felix with questions, still he answered\r\nthem as copiously as he could; he felt too grateful for their kindness\r\nnot to satisfy them. His bow was handled, his arrows carried about so\r\nthat the quiver for the time was empty, and the arrows scattered in\r\ntwenty hands. He astonished them by exhibiting his skill with the\r\nweapon, striking a tree with an arrow at nearly three hundred yards.\r\n\r\nThough familiar, of course, with the bow, they had never seen shooting\r\nlike that, nor, indeed, any archery except at short quarters. They had\r\nno other arms themselves but spears and knives. Seeing one of the women\r\ncutting the boughs from a fallen tree, dead and dry, and, therefore,\r\npreferable for fuel, Felix naturally went to help her, and, taking the\r\naxe, soon made a bundle, which he carried for her. It was his duty as a\r\nnoble to see than no woman, not a slave, laboured; he had been bred in\r\nthat idea, and would have felt disgraced had he permitted it. The women\r\nlooked on with astonishment, for in these rude tribes the labour of the\r\nwomen was considered valuable and appraised like that of a horse.\r\n\r\nWithout any conscious design, Felix thus in one day conciliated and won\r\nthe regard of the two most powerful parties in the camp, the chief and\r\nthe women. By his refusing the command the chief was flattered, and his\r\npossible hostility prevented. The act of cutting the wood and carrying\r\nthe bundle gave him the hearts of the women. They did not, indeed, think\r\ntheir labour in any degree oppressive; still, to be relieved of it was\r\npleasing.\r\n\r\nThe two men who had gone for Felix's buried treasure did not return till\r\nbreakfast next morning. They stepped into the camp, each with his spear\r\nreddened and dripping with fresh blood. Felix no sooner saw the blood\r\nthan he fainted. He quickly recovered, but he could not endure the sight\r\nof the spears, which were removed and hidden from his view. He had seen\r\nblood enough spilt at the siege of Iwis, but this came upon him in all\r\nits horror unrelieved by the excitement of war.\r\n\r\nThe two shepherds had been dogged by gipsies, and had been obliged to\r\nmake a round to escape. They took their revenge by climbing into trees,\r\nand as their pursuers passed under thrust them through with their long\r\nspears. The shepherds, like all their related tribes, had been at feud\r\nwith the gipsies for many generations. The gipsies followed them to and\r\nfrom their pastures, cut off stragglers, destroyed or stole their sheep\r\nand cattle, and now and then overwhelmed a whole tribe. Of late the\r\ncontest had become more sanguinary and almost ceaseless.\r\n\r\nMounted on swift, though small, horses, the gipsies had the advantage of\r\nthe shepherds. On the other hand, the shepherds, being men of great\r\nstature and strength, could not be carried away by a rush if they had\r\ntime to form a circle, as was their custom of battle. They lost many men\r\nby the javelins thrown by the gipsies, who rode up to the edge of the\r\ncircle, cast their darts, and retreated. If the shepherds left their\r\ncircle they were easily ridden over; while they maintained formation\r\nthey lost individuals, but saved the mass. Battles were of rare\r\noccurrence; the gipsies watched for opportunities and executed raids,\r\nthe shepherds retaliated, and thus the endless war continued. The\r\nshepherds invariably posted sentinels, and sent forward scouts to\r\nascertain if the way were clear. Accustomed to the horrid scenes of war\r\nfrom childhood, they could not understand Felix's sensitiveness.\r\n\r\nThey laughed, and then petted him like a spoilt child. This galled him\r\nexceedingly; he felt humiliated, and eager to reassert his manhood. He\r\nwas willing to stay with them there for awhile, nothing would have\r\ninduced him to leave them now till he had vindicated himself in their\r\nsight. The incident happened soon after sunrise, which is very early at\r\nthe end of June. The camp had only waited for the return of these men,\r\nand on their appearance began to move. The march that morning was not a\r\nlong one, as the sky was clear and the heat soon wearied the flocks.\r\nFelix accompanied the scout in advance, armed with his bow, eager to\r\nencounter the gipsies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nBOW AND ARROW\r\n\r\n\r\nThree mornings the shepherds marched in the same manner, when they came\r\nin view of a range of hills so high that to Felix they appeared\r\nmountains. The home of the tribe was in these hills, and once there they\r\nwere comparatively safe from attack. In early spring when the herbage on\r\nthe downs was scarce, the flocks moved to the meadowlike lands far in\r\nthe valleys; in summer they returned to the hills; in autumn they went\r\nto the vales again. Soon after noon on the third day the scouts reported\r\nthat a large body of gipsies were moving in a direction which would cut\r\noff their course to the hills on the morrow.\r\n\r\nThe chief held a council, and it was determined that a forced march\r\nshould be made at once by another route, more to the left, and it was\r\nthought that in this way they might reach the base of the slopes by\r\nevening. The distance was not great, and could easily have been\r\ntraversed by the men; the flocks and herds, however, could not be\r\nhurried much. A messenger was despatched to the hills for assistance,\r\nand the march began. It was a tedious movement. Felix was wearied, and\r\nwalked in a drowsy state. Towards six o'clock, as he guessed, the trees\r\nbegan to thin, and the column reached the first slopes of the hills.\r\nHere about thirty shepherds joined them, a contingent from the nearest\r\ncamp. It was considered that the danger was now past, and that the\r\ngipsies would not attack them on the hill; but it was a mistake.\r\n\r\nA large body almost immediately appeared, coming along the slope on the\r\nright, not less than two hundred; and from their open movements and\r\nnumbers it was evident that they intended battle. The flocks and herds\r\nwere driven hastily into a coombe, or narrow valley, and there left to\r\ntheir fate. All the armed men formed in a circle; the women occupied the\r\ncentre. Felix took his stand outside the circle by a gnarled and decayed\r\noak. There was just there a slight rise in the ground, which he knew\r\nwould give him some advantage in discharging his arrows, and would also\r\nallow him a clear view. His friends earnestly entreated him to enter the\r\ncircle, and even sought to bring him within it by force, till he\r\nexplained to them that he could not shoot if so surrounded, and promised\r\nif the gipsies charged to rush inside.\r\n\r\nFelix unslung his quiver, and placed it on the ground before him; a\r\nsecond quiver he put beside it; four or five arrows he stuck upright in\r\nthe sward, so that he could catch hold of them quickly; two arrows he\r\nheld in his left hand, another he fitted to the string. Thus prepared,\r\nhe watched the gipsies advance. They came walking their short wiry\r\nhorses to within half a mile, when they began to trot down the slope;\r\nthey could not surround the shepherds because of the steep-sided coombe\r\nand some brushwood, and could advance only on two fronts. Felix rapidly\r\nbecame so excited that his sight was affected, and his head whirled. His\r\nheart beat with such speed that his breath seemed going. His limbs\r\ntottered, and he dreaded lest he should faint.\r\n\r\nHis intensely nervous organization, strung up to its highest pitch,\r\nshook him in its grasp, and his will was powerless to control it. He\r\nfelt that he should disgrace himself once more before these rugged but\r\nbrave shepherds, who betrayed not the slightest symptom of agitation.\r\nFor one hour of Oliver's calm courage and utter absence of nervousness\r\nhe would have given years of his life. His friends in the circle\r\nobserved his agitation, and renewed their entreaties to him to come\r\ninside it. This only was needed to complete his discomfiture. He lost\r\nhis head altogether; he saw nothing but a confused mass of yellow and\r\nred rushing towards him, for each of the gipsies wore a yellow or red\r\nscarf, some about the body, some over the shoulder, others round the\r\nhead. They were now within three hundred yards.\r\n\r\nA murmur from the shepherd spearmen. Felix had discharged an arrow. It\r\nstuck in the ground about twenty paces from him. He shot again; it flew\r\nwild and quivering, and dropped harmlessly. Another murmur; they\r\nexpressed to each other their contempt for the bow. This immediately\r\nrestored Felix; he forgot the enemy as an enemy, he forgot himself; he\r\nthought only of his skill as an archer, now in question. Pride upheld\r\nhim. The third arrow he fitted properly to the string, he planted his\r\nleft foot slightly in advance, and looked steadfastly at the horsemen\r\nbefore he drew his bow.\r\n\r\nAt a distance of one hundred and fifty yards they had paused, and were\r\nwidening out so as to advance in loose open rank and allow each man to\r\nthrow his javelin. They shouted; the spearmen in the circle replied, and\r\nlevelled their spears. Felix fixed his eye on one of the gipsies who was\r\nordering and marshalling the rest, a chief. He drew the arrow swiftly\r\nbut quietly, the string hummed, the pliant yew obeyed, and the long\r\narrow shot forward in a steady swift flight like a line of gossamer\r\ndrawn through the air. It missed the chief, but pierced the horse he\r\nrode just in front of the rider's thigh. The maddened horse reared and\r\nfell backwards on his rider.\r\n\r\nThe spearmen shouted. Before the sound could leave their lips another\r\narrow had sped; a gipsy threw up his arms with a shriek; the arrow had\r\ngone through his body. A third, a fourth, a fifth--six gipsies rolled on\r\nthe sward. Shout upon shout rent the air from the spearmen. Utterly\r\nunused to this mode of fighting, the gipsies fell back. Still the fatal\r\narrows pursued them, and ere they were out of range three others fell.\r\nNow the rage of battle burned in Felix; his eyes gleamed, his lips were\r\nopen, his nostrils wide like a horse running a race. He shouted to the\r\nspearmen to follow him, and snatching up his quiver ran forward.\r\nGathered together in a group, the gipsy band consulted.\r\n\r\nFelix ran at full speed; swift of foot, he left the heavy spearmen\r\nbehind. Alone he approached the horsemen; all the Aquila courage was up\r\nwithin him. He kept the higher ground as he ran, and stopped suddenly on\r\na little knoll or tumulus. His arrow flew, a gipsy fell. Again, and a\r\nthird. Their anger gave them fresh courage; to be repulsed by one only!\r\nTwenty of them started to charge and run him down. The keen arrows flew\r\nfaster than their horses' feet. Now the horse and now the man met those\r\nsharp points. Six fell; the rest returned. The shepherds came running;\r\nFelix ordered them to charge the gipsies. His success gave him\r\nauthority; they obeyed; and as they charged, he shot nine more arrows;\r\nnine more deadly wounds. Suddenly the gipsy band turned and fled into\r\nthe brushwood on the lower slopes.\r\n\r\nBreathless, Felix sat down on the knoll, and the spearmen swarmed around\r\nhim. Hardly had they begun to speak to him than there was a shout, and\r\nthey saw a body of shepherds descending the hill. There were three\r\nhundred of them; warned by the messenger, the whole country had risen to\r\nrepel the gipsies. Too late to join in the fight, they had seen the last\r\nof it. They examined the field. There were ten dead and six wounded, who\r\nwere taken prisoners; the rest escaped, though hurt. In many cases the\r\narrow had gone clean through the body. Then, for the first time, they\r\nunderstood the immense power of the yew bow in strong and skilful hands.\r\n\r\nFelix was overwhelmed; they almost crushed him with their attentions;\r\nthe women fell at his feet and kissed them. But the archer could\r\nscarcely reply; his intense nervous excitement had left him weak and\r\nalmost faint; his one idea was to rest. As he walked back to the camp\r\nbetween the chiefs of the shepherd spearmen, his eyes closed, his limbs\r\ntottered, and they had to support him. At the camp he threw himself on\r\nthe sward, under the gnarled oak, and was instantly fast asleep.\r\nImmediately the camp was stilled, not to disturb him.\r\n\r\nHis adventures in the marshes of the buried city, his canoe, his\r\narchery, were talked of the livelong night. Next morning the camp set\r\nout for their home in the mountains, and he was escorted by nearly four\r\nhundred spearmen. They had saved for him the ornaments of the gipsies\r\nwho had fallen, golden earrings and nose-rings. He gave them to the\r\nwomen, except one, a finger-ring, set with turquoise, and evidently of\r\nancient make, which he kept for Aurora. Two marches brought them to the\r\nhome of the tribe, where the rest of the spearmen left them. The place\r\nwas called Wolfstead.\r\n\r\nFelix saw at once how easily this spot might be fortified. There was a\r\ndeep and narrow valley like a groove or green trench opening to the\r\nsouth. At the upper end of the valley rose a hill, not very high, but\r\nsteep, narrow at the ridge, and steep again on the other side. Over it\r\nwas a broad, wooded, and beautiful vale; beyond that again the higher\r\nmountains. Towards the foot of the narrow ridge here, there was a\r\nsuccession of chalk cliffs, so that to climb up on that side in the face\r\nof opposition would be extremely difficult. In the gorge of the enclosed\r\nnarrow valley a spring rose. The shepherds had formed eight pools, one\r\nafter the other, water being of great importance to them; and farther\r\ndown, where the valley opened, there were forty or fifty acres of\r\nirrigated meadow. The spring then ran into a considerable brook, across\r\nwhich was the forest.\r\n\r\nFelix's idea was to run a palisade along the margin of the brook, and up\r\nboth sides of the valley to the ridge. There he would build a fort. The\r\nedges of the chalk cliffs he would connect with a palisade or a wall,\r\nand so form a complete enclosure. He mentioned his scheme to the\r\nshepherds; they did not greatly care for it, as they had always been\r\nsecure without it, the rugged nature of the country not permitting\r\nhorsemen to penetrate. But they were so completely under his influence\r\nthat to please him they set about the work. He had to show them how to\r\nmake a palisade; they had never seen one, and he made the first part of\r\nit himself. At building a wall with loose stones, without mortar, the\r\nshepherds were skilful; the wall along the verge of the cliffs was soon\r\nup, and so was the fort on the top of the ridge. The fort consisted\r\nmerely of a circular wall, breast high, with embrasures or\r\ncrenellations.\r\n\r\nWhen this was finished, Felix had a sense of mastership, for in this\r\nfort he felt as if he could rule the whole country. From day to day\r\nshepherds came from the more distant parts to see the famous archer, and\r\nto admire the enclosure. Though the idea of it had never occurred to\r\nthem, now they saw it they fully understood its advantages, and two\r\nother chiefs began to erect similar forts and palisades.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nSURPRISED\r\n\r\n\r\nFelix was now anxious to continue his journey, yet he did not like to\r\nleave the shepherds, with whom his life was so pleasant. As usual, when\r\ndeliberating, he wandered about the hills, and then into the forest. The\r\nshepherds at first insisted on at least two of their number accompanying\r\nhim; they were fearful lest the gipsies should seize him, or a Bushman\r\nassassinate him. This company was irksome to Felix. In time he convinced\r\nthem that he was a much better hunter than any of the tribe, and they\r\npermitted him to roam alone. During one of these excursions into the\r\nforest he discovered a beautiful lake. He looked down on the water from\r\nthe summit of one of the green mountains.\r\n\r\nIt was, he thought, half a mile across, and the opposite shore was open\r\nwoodland, grassy and meadow-like, and dotted with fine old oaks. By\r\ndegrees these closed together, and the forest succeeded; beyond it\r\nagain, at a distance of two miles, were green hills. A little clearing\r\nonly was wanted to make the place fit for a castle and enclosure.\r\nThrough the grass-land opposite he traced the course of a large brook\r\ndown to the lake; another entered it on the right, and the lake\r\ngradually narrowed to a river on his left. Could he erect a tower there,\r\nand bring Aurora to it, how happy he would be! A more beautiful spot he\r\nhad never seen, nor one more suited for every purpose in life.\r\n\r\nHe followed the course of the stream which left the lake, every now and\r\nthen disturbing wild goats from the cliffs, and twice he saw deer under\r\nthe oaks across it. On rounding a spur of down he saw that the river\r\ndebouched into a much wider lake, which he conjectured must be the Sweet\r\nWaters. He went on till he reached the mouth of the river, and had then\r\nno doubt that he was standing once more on the shore of the Sweet Water\r\nsea. On this, the southern side, the banks were low; on the other, a\r\nsteep chalky cliff almost overhung the river, and jutted out into the\r\nlake, curving somewhat towards him. A fort on that cliff would command\r\nthe entrance to the river; the cliff was a natural breakwater, so that\r\nthere was a haven at its base. The river appeared broad and deep enough\r\nfor navigation, so that vessels could pass from the great Lake to the\r\ninland water; about six or seven miles, he supposed.\r\n\r\nFelix was much taken with this spot; the beauty of the inland lake, the\r\nevident richness of the soil, the river communicating with the great\r\nLake, the cliff commanding its entrance; never, in all his wanderings,\r\nhad he seen a district so well suited for a settlement and the founding\r\nof a city. If he had but a thousand men! How soon he would bring Aurora\r\nthere, and build a tower, and erect a palisade! So occupied was he with\r\nthe thought that he returned the whole distance to the spot where he had\r\nmade the discovery. There he remained a long time, designing it all in\r\nhis mind.\r\n\r\nThe tower he would build yonder, three-quarters of a mile, perhaps a\r\nmile, inland from the opposite shore, on a green knoll, at the base of\r\nwhich the brook flowed. It would be even more pleasant there than on the\r\nshore of the lake. The forest he would clear back a little, and put up a\r\nstout palisade, enclosing at least three miles of grassy land. By the\r\nshore of the lake he would build his town, so that his vessels might be\r\nable to go forth into the great Sweet Water sea. So strongly did\r\nimagination hold him that he did not observe how near it was to sunset,\r\nnor did he remark the threatening aspect of the sky. Thunder awoke him\r\nfrom his dream; he looked, and saw a storm rapidly coming from the\r\nnorth-east.\r\n\r\nHe descended the hill, and sheltered himself as well as possible among\r\nsome thick fir-trees. After the lightning, the rain poured so heavily\r\nthat it penetrated the branches, and he unstrung his bow and placed the\r\nstring in his pocket, that it might not become wet. Instantly there was\r\na whoop on either side, and two gipsies darted from the undergrowth\r\ntowards him. While the terrible bow was bent they had followed him,\r\ntracking his footsteps; the moment he unstrung the bow, they rushed out.\r\nFelix crushed through between the firs, by main force getting through,\r\nbut only opening a passage for them to follow. They could easily have\r\nthrust their darts through him, but their object was to take him alive,\r\nand gratify the revenge of the tribes with torture.\r\n\r\nFelix doubled from the firs, and made towards the far-distant camp; but\r\nhe was faced by three more gipsies. He turned again and made for the\r\nsteep hill he had descended. With all his strength he raced up it; his\r\nlightness of foot carried him in advance, and he reached the summit a\r\nhundred yards ahead; but he knew he must be overtaken presently, unless\r\nhe could hit upon some stratagem. In the instant that he paused to\r\nbreathe on the summit a thought struck him. Like the wind he raced along\r\nthe ridge, making for the great Sweet Water, the same path he had\r\nfollowed in the morning. Once on the ridge the five pursuers shouted;\r\nthey knew they should have him now there were no more hills to breast.\r\nIt was not so easy as they imagined.\r\n\r\nFelix was in splendid training; he kept his lead, and even drew a little\r\non them. Still he knew in time he must succumb, just as the stag, though\r\nswifter of foot, ultimately succumbs to the hounds. They would track him\r\ntill they had him. If only he could gain enough to have time to string\r\nand bend his bow! But with all his efforts he could not get away more\r\nthan the hundred yards, and that was not far enough. It could be\r\ntraversed in ten seconds, they would have him before he could string it\r\nand fit an arrow. If only he had been fresh as in the morning! But he\r\nhad had a long walk during the day and not much food. He knew that his\r\nburst of speed must soon slacken, but he had a stratagem yet.\r\n\r\nKeeping along the ridge till he reached the place where the lake\r\nnarrowed to the river, suddenly he rushed down the hill towards the\r\nwater. The edge was encumbered with brushwood and fallen trees; he\r\nscrambled over and through anyhow; he tore a path through the bushes and\r\nplunged in. But his jacket caught in a branch; he had his knife out and\r\ncut off the shred of cloth. Then with the bow and knife in one hand he\r\nstruck out for the opposite shore. His hope was that the gipsies, being\r\nhorsemen, and passing all their lives on their horses, might not know\r\nhow to swim. His conjecture was right; they stopped on the brink, and\r\nyelled their loudest. When he had passed the middle of the slow stream\r\ntheir rage rose to a shriek, startling a heron far down the water.\r\n\r\nFelix reached the opposite shore in safety, but the bow-string was now\r\nwet and useless. He struck off at once straight across the grass-lands,\r\npast the oaks he had admired, past the green knoll where in imagination\r\nhe had built his castle and brought Aurora, through the brook, which he\r\nfound was larger than it appeared at a distance, and required two or\r\nthree strokes to cross. A few more paces and the forest sheltered him.\r\nUnder the trees he rested, and considered what course to pursue. The\r\ngipsies would expect him to endeavour to regain his friends, and would\r\nwatch to cut off his return. Felix determined to make, instead, for\r\nanother camp farther east, and to get even there by a detour.\r\n\r\nBitterly he reproached himself for his folly in leaving the camp,\r\nknowing that gipsies were about, with no other weapon than the bow. The\r\nknife at his belt was practically no weapon at all, useful only in the\r\nlast extremity. Had he a short sword, or javelin, he would have faced\r\nthe two gipsies who first sprang towards him. Worse than this was the\r\nfolly of wandering without the least precaution into a territory at that\r\ntime full of gipsies, who had every reason to desire his capture. If he\r\nhad used the ordinary precautions of woodcraft, he would have noticed\r\ntheir traces, and he would not have exposed himself in full view on the\r\nridges of the hills, where a man was visible for miles. If he perished\r\nthrough his carelessness, how bitter it would be! To lose Aurora by the\r\nmerest folly would, indeed, be humiliating.\r\n\r\nHe braced himself to the journey before him, and set off at a good\r\nswinging hunter's pace, as it is called, that is, a pace rather more\r\nthan a walk and less than a run, with the limbs somewhat bent, and long\r\nspringy steps. The forest was in the worst possible condition for\r\nmovement; the rain had damped the fern and undergrowth, and every branch\r\nshowered raindrops upon him. It was now past sunset and the dusk was\r\nincreasing; this he welcomed as hiding him. He travelled on till nearly\r\ndawn, and then, turning to the right, swept round, and regained the line\r\nof the mountainous hills after sunrise. There he rested, and reached a\r\ncamp about nine in the morning, having walked altogether since the\r\npreceding morning fully fifty miles. This camp was about fifteen miles\r\ndistant from that of his friends; the shepherds knew him, and one of\r\nthem started with the news of his safety. In the afternoon ten of his\r\nfriends came over to see him, and to reproach him.\r\n\r\nHis weariness was so great that for three days he scarcely moved from\r\nthe hut, during which time the weather was wet and stormy, as is often\r\nthe case in summer after a thunderstorm. On the fourth morning it was\r\nfine, and Felix, now quite restored to his usual strength, went out with\r\nthe shepherds. He found some of them engaged in throwing up a heap of\r\nstones, flint, and chalk lumps near an oak-tree in a plain at the foot\r\nof the hill. They told him that during the thunderstorm two cows and ten\r\nsheep had been killed there by lightning, which had scarcely injured the\r\noak.\r\n\r\nIt was their custom to pile up a heap of stones wherever such an event\r\noccurred, to warn others from staying themselves, or allowing their\r\nsheep or cattle to stay, near the spot in thunder, as it was observed\r\nthat where lightning struck once it was sure to strike again, sooner or\r\nlater. \"Then,\" said Felix, \"you may be sure there is water there!\" He\r\nknew from his study of the knowledge of the ancients that lightning\r\nfrequently leaped from trees or buildings to concealed water, but he had\r\nno intention of indicating water in that particular spot. He meant the\r\nremark in a general sense.\r\n\r\nBut the shepherds, ever desirous of water, and looking on Felix as a\r\nbeing of a different order to themselves, took his casual observation in\r\nits literal sense. They brought their tools and dug, and, as it chanced,\r\nfound a copious spring. The water gushed forth and formed a streamlet.\r\nUpon this the whole tribe gathered, and they saluted Felix as one almost\r\ndivine. It was in vain that he endeavoured to repel this homage, and to\r\nexplain the reason of his remark, and that it was only in a general way\r\nthat he intended it. Facts were too strong for him. They had heard his\r\nwords, which they considered an inspiration, and _there_ was the water.\r\nIt was no use; _there_ was the spring, the very thing they most wanted.\r\nPerforce Felix was invested with attributes beyond nature.\r\n\r\nThe report spread; his own old friends came in a crowd to see the new\r\nspring, others journeyed from afar. In a week, Felix having meanwhile\r\nreturned to Wolfstead, his fame had for the second time spread all over\r\nthe district. Some came a hundred miles to see him. Nothing he could say\r\nwas listened to; these simple, straightforward people understood nothing\r\nbut facts, and the defeat of the gipsies and the discovery of the spring\r\nseemed to them little less than supernatural. Besides which, in\r\ninnumerable little ways Felix's superior knowledge had told upon them.\r\nHis very manners spoke of high training. His persuasive voice won them.\r\nHis constructive skill and power of planning, as shown in the palisades\r\nand enclosure, showed a grasp of circumstances new to them. This was a\r\nman such as they had never before seen.\r\n\r\nThey began to bring him disputes to settle; he shrank from this position\r\nof judge, but it was useless to struggle; they would wait as long as he\r\nliked, but his decision they would have, and no other. Next came the\r\nsick begging to be cured. Here Felix was firm; he would not attempt to\r\nbe a physician, and they went away. But, unfortunately, it happened that\r\nhe let out his knowledge of plants, and back they came. Felix did not\r\nknow what course to pursue; if by chance he did any one good, crowds\r\nwould beset him; if injury resulted, perhaps he would be assassinated.\r\nThis fear was quite unfounded; he really had not the smallest idea of\r\nhow high he stood in their estimation.\r\n\r\nAfter much consideration, Felix hit upon a method which would save him\r\nfrom many inconveniences. He announced his intention of forming a\r\nherb-garden in which to grow the best kind of herbs, and at the same\r\ntime said he would not administer any medicine himself, but would tell\r\ntheir own native physicians and nurses all he knew, so that they could\r\nuse his knowledge. The herb-garden was at once begun in the valley; it\r\ncould not contain much till next year, and meantime if any diseased\r\npersons came Felix saw them, expressed his opinion to the old shepherd\r\nwho was the doctor of the tribe, and the latter carried out his\r\ninstructions. Felix did succeed in relieving some small ailments, and\r\nthereby added to his reputation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nFOR AURORA\r\n\r\n\r\nFelix now began to find out for himself the ancient truth, that\r\ndifficulties always confront man. Success only changes them, and\r\nincreases their number. Difficulties faced him in every direction; at\r\nhome it had seemed impossible for him to do anything. Now that success\r\nseemed to smile on him and he had become a power, instead of everything\r\nbeing smooth and easy, new difficulties sprang up for solution at every\r\npoint. He wished to continue his journey, but he feared that he would\r\nnot be permitted to depart. He would have to start away in the night, in\r\nwhich case he could hardly return to them again, and yet he wished to\r\nreturn to these, the first friends he had had, and amongst whom he hoped\r\nto found a city.\r\n\r\nAnother week slipped away, and Felix was meditating his escape, when one\r\nafternoon a deputation of ten spearmen arrived from a distant tribe, who\r\nhad nominated him their king, and sent their principal men to convey the\r\nintelligence. Fame is always greatest at a distance, and this tribe in\r\nthe mountains of the east had actually chosen him as king, and declared\r\nthat they would obey him whether he took up his residence with them or\r\nnot. Felix was naturally greatly pleased; how delighted Aurora would be!\r\nbut he was in perplexity what to do, for he could not tell whether the\r\nWolfstead people would be favourably inclined or would resent his\r\nselection.\r\n\r\nHe had not long to consider. There was an assembly of the tribe, and\r\nthey, too, chose him by common consent as their king. Secretly they were\r\nannoyed that another tribe had been more forward than themselves, and\r\nwere anxious that Felix should not leave them. Felix declined the\r\nhonour; in spite of his refusal, he was treated as if he were the most\r\ndespotic monarch. Four days afterwards two other tribes joined the\r\nmovement, and sent their acceptance of him as their monarch. Others\r\nfollowed, and so quickly now that a day never passed without another\r\ntribe sending a deputation.\r\n\r\nFelix thought deeply on the matter. He was, of course, flattered, and\r\nready to accept the dignity, but he was alive to considerations of\r\npolicy. He resolved that he would not use the title, nor exercise the\r\nfunctions of a king as usually understood. He explained his plan to the\r\nchiefs; it was that he should be called simply \"Leader\", the Leader of\r\nthe War; that he should only assume royal authority in time of war; that\r\nthe present chiefs should retain their authority, and each govern as\r\nbefore, in accordance with ancient custom. He proposed to be king only\r\nduring war-time. He would, if they liked, write out their laws for them\r\nin a book, and so give their customs cohesion and shape. To this plan\r\nthe tribes readily agreed; it retained all the former customs, it left\r\nthe chiefs their simple patriarchal authority, and it gave all of them\r\nthe advantage of combination in war. As the Leader, Felix was henceforth\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nIn the course of a fortnight, upwards of six thousand men had joined the\r\nConfederacy, and Felix wrote down the names of twenty tribes on a sheet\r\nof parchment which he took from his chest. A hut had long since been\r\nbuilt for him; but he received all the deputations, and held the\r\nassemblies which were necessary, in the circular fort. He was so pressed\r\nto visit the tribes that he could not refuse to go to the nearest, and\r\nthus his journey was again postponed. During this progress from tribal\r\ncamp to tribal camp, Felix gained the adhesion of twelve more, making a\r\ntotal of thirty-two names of camps, representing about eight thousand\r\nspearmen. With pride Felix reflected that he commanded a far larger army\r\nthan the Prince of Ponze. But he was not happy.\r\n\r\nMonths had now elapsed since he had parted from Aurora. There were no\r\nmeans of communicating with her. A letter could be conveyed only by a\r\nspecial messenger; he could not get a messenger, and even if one had\r\nbeen forthcoming, he could not instruct him how to reach Thyma Castle.\r\nHe did not know himself; the country was entirely unexplored. Except\r\nthat the direction was west, he had no knowledge whatever. He had often\r\ninquired of the shepherds, but they were perfectly ignorant. Anker's\r\nGate was the most westerly of all their settlements, which chiefly\r\nextended eastwards. Beyond Anker's Gate was the trackless forest, of\r\nwhich none but the Bushmen knew anything. They did not understand what\r\nhe meant by a map; all they could tell him was that the range of\r\nmountainous hills continued westerly and southerly for an unascertained\r\ndistance, and that the country was uninhabited except by wandering gipsy\r\ntribes.\r\n\r\nSouth was the sea, the salt water; but they never went down to it, or\r\nnear it, because there was no sustenance for their flocks and herds.\r\nTill now, Felix did not know that he was near the sea; he resolved at\r\nonce to visit it. As nearly as he could discover, the great fresh water\r\nLake did not reach any farther south; Wolfstead was not far from its\r\nsouthern margin. He concluded, therefore, that the shore of the Lake\r\nmust run continually westward, and that if he followed it he should\r\nultimately reach the very creek from which he had started in his canoe.\r\nHow far it was he could not reckon.\r\n\r\nThere were none of the shepherds who could be sent with a letter; they\r\nwere not hunters, and were unused to woodcraft; there was not one\r\ncapable of the journey. Unless he went himself he could not communicate\r\nwith Aurora. Two routes were open to him; one straight through the\r\nforest on foot, the other by water, which latter entailed the\r\nconstruction of another canoe. Journey by water, too, he had found was\r\nsubject to unforeseen risks. Till he could train some of the younger men\r\nto row a galley, he decided not to attempt the voyage. There was but the\r\nforest route left, and that he resolved to attempt; but when? And how,\r\nwithout offending his friends?\r\n\r\nMeantime, while he revolved the subject in his mind, he visited the\r\nriver and the shore of the great Lake, this time accompanied by ten\r\nspears. The second visit only increased his admiration of the place and\r\nhis desire to take possession of it. He ascended a tall larch, from\r\nwhose boughs he had a view out over the Lake; the shore seemed to go\r\nalmost directly west. There were no islands, and no land in sight; the\r\nwater was open and clear. Next day he started for the sea; he wished to\r\nsee it for its own sake, and, secondly, because if he could trace the\r\ntrend of the shore, he would perhaps be able to put together a mental\r\nmap of the country, and so assure himself of the right route to pursue\r\nwhen he started for Thyma Castle.\r\n\r\nHis guides took him directly south, and in three marches (three days)\r\nbrought him to the strand. This journey was not in a straight line; they\r\nconsidered it was about five-and-thirty or forty miles to the sea, but\r\nthe country was covered with almost impenetrable forests, which\r\ncompelled a circuitous path. They had also to avoid a great ridge of\r\nhills, and to slip through a pass or river valley, because these hills\r\nwere frequently traversed by the gipsies who were said, indeed, to\r\ntravel along them for hundreds of miles. Through the river valley,\r\ntherefore, which wound between the hills, they approached the sea, so\r\nmuch on a level with it that Felix did not catch a distant glimpse.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon of the third day they heard a low murmur, and soon\r\nafterwards came out from the forest itself upon a wide bed of shingle,\r\nthinly bordered with scattered bushes on the inland side. Climbing over\r\nthis, Felix saw the green line of the sea rise and extend itself on\r\neither hand; in the glory of the scene he forgot his anxieties and his\r\nhopes, they fell from him together, leaving the mind alone with itself\r\nand love. For the memory of Aurora rendered the beauty before him still\r\nmore beautiful; love, like the sunshine, threw a glamour over the waves.\r\nHis old and highest thoughts returned to him in all their strength. He\r\nmust follow them, he could not help himself. Standing where the foam\r\ncame nearly to his feet, the resolution to pursue his aspirations took\r\npossession of him as strong as the sea. When he turned from it, he said\r\nto himself, \"This is the first step homewards to her; this is the first\r\nstep of my renewed labour.\" To fulfil his love and his ambition was one\r\nand the same thing. He must see her, and then again endeavour with all\r\nhis abilities to make himself a position which she could share.\r\n\r\nTowards the evening, leaving his escort, he partly ascended the nearest\r\nslope of the hills to ascertain more perfectly than was possible at a\r\nlower level the direction in which the shore trended. It was nearly east\r\nand west, and as the shore of the inland lake ran west, it appeared that\r\nbetween them there was a broad belt of forest. Through this he must\r\npass, and he thought if he continued due west he should cross an\r\nimaginary line drawn south from his own home through Thyma Castle; then\r\nby turning to the north he should presently reach that settlement. But\r\nwhen he should cross this line, how many days' travelling it would need\r\nto reach it, was a matter of conjecture, and he must be guided by\r\ncircumstances, the appearance of the country, and his hunter's instinct.\r\n\r\nOn the way back to Wolfstead Felix was occupied in considering how he\r\ncould leave his friends, and yet be able to return to them and resume\r\nhis position. His general idea was to build a fortified house or castle\r\nat the spot which had so pleased him, and to bring Aurora to it. He\r\ncould then devote himself to increasing and consolidating his rule over\r\nthese people, and perhaps in time organize a kingdom. But without Aurora\r\nthe time it would require would be unendurable; by some means he must\r\nbring her. The whole day long as he walked he thought and thought,\r\ntrying to discover some means by which he could accomplish these things;\r\nyet the more he considered the more difficult they appeared to him.\r\nThere seemed no plan that promised success; all he could do would be to\r\nrisk the attempt.\r\n\r\nBut two days after returning from the sea it chanced towards the\r\nafternoon he fell asleep, and on awakening found his mind full of ideas\r\nwhich he felt sure would succeed if anything would. The question had\r\nsolved itself during sleep; the mind, like a wearied limb, strained by\r\ntoo much effort, had recovered its elasticity and freshness, and he saw\r\nclearly what he ought to do.\r\n\r\nHe convened an assembly of the chief men of the nearest tribes, and\r\naddressed them in the circular fort. He asked them if they could place\r\nsufficient confidence in him to assist him in carrying out certain\r\nplans, although he should not be able to altogether disclose the object\r\nhe had in view.\r\n\r\nThey replied as one man that they had perfect confidence in him, and\r\nwould implicitly obey.\r\n\r\nHe then said that the first thing he wished was the clearing of the land\r\nby the river in order that he might erect a fortified dwelling suitable\r\nto his position as their Leader in war. Next he desired their permission\r\nto leave them for two months, at the end of which he would return. He\r\ncould not at that time explain the reasons, but until his journey had\r\nbeen made he could not finally settle among them.\r\n\r\nTo this announcement they listened in profound silence. It was evident\r\nthat they disliked him leaving them, yet did not wish to seem\r\ndistrustful by expressing the feeling.\r\n\r\nThirdly, he continued, he wanted them to clear a path through the\r\nforest, commencing at Anker's Gate and proceeding exactly west. The\r\ntrack to be thirty yards wide in order that the undergrowth might not\r\nencroach upon it, and to be carried on straight to the westward until\r\nhis return. The distance to which this path was cleared he should take\r\nas the measure of their loyalty to him.\r\n\r\nThey immediately promised to fulfil this desire, but added that there\r\nwas no necessity to wait till he left them, it should be commenced the\r\nvery next morning. To his reiterated request for leave of absence they\r\npreserved an ominous silence, and as he had no more to say, the assembly\r\nthen broke up.\r\n\r\nIt was afternoon, and Felix, as he watched the departing chiefs,\r\nreflected that these men would certainly set a watch upon him to prevent\r\nhis escape. Without another moment's delay he entered his hut, and took\r\nfrom their hiding-place the diamond bracelet, the turquoise ring, and\r\nother presents for Aurora. He also secured some provisions, and put two\r\nspare bowstrings in his pocket. His bow of course he carried.\r\n\r\nTelling the people about that he was going to the next settlement,\r\nBedeston, and was anxious to overtake the chief from that place who had\r\nattended the assembly, he started. So soon as he knew he could not be\r\nseen from the settlement he quitted the trail, and made a wide circuit\r\ntill he faced westwards. Anker's Gate was a small outlying post, the\r\nmost westerly from Wolfstead; he went near it to get a true direction,\r\nbut not sufficiently near to be observed. This was on the fourth of\r\nSeptember. The sun was declining as he finally left the country of his\r\nfriends, and entered the immense forest which lay between him and\r\nAurora. Not only was there no track, but no one had ever traversed it,\r\nunless, indeed, it were Bushmen, who to all intents might be confused\r\nwith the wild animals which it contained.\r\n\r\nYet his heart rose as he walked rapidly among the oaks; already he saw\r\nher, he felt the welcoming touch of her hand; the danger of Bushman or\r\ngipsy was nothing. The forest at the commencement consisted chiefly of\r\noaks, trees which do not grow close together, and so permitted of quick\r\nwalking. Felix pushed on, absorbed in thought. The sun sank; still\r\nonward; and as the dusk fell he was still moving rapidly westwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe End\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------",
