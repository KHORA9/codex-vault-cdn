If that opinion exists, I hope this evening to be able to\r\nremove it, and to convince you that we have to deal with an exquisitely\r\nregulated phenomenon, and one which very happily illustrates some of the\r\nfundamental properties of fluids. It may be mentioned also that the\r\nrecent researches of Lenard in Germany and J.J. Thomson at Cambridge, on\r\nthe curious development of electrical charges that accompanies certain\r\nkinds of splashes, have invested with a new interest any examination of\r\nthe mechanics of the phenomenon. It is to the mechanical and not to the\r\nelectrical side of the question that I shall call your attention this\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nThe first well-directed and deliberate observations on the subject that\r\nI am acquainted with were made by a school-boy at Rugby some twenty\r\nyears ago, and were reported by him to the Rugby Natural History\r\nSociety. He had observed that the marks of accidental splashes of\r\nink-drops that had fallen on some smoked glasses with which he was\r\nexperimenting, presented an appearance not easy to account for. Drops of\r\nthe same size falling from the same height had made always the same\r\nkind of mark, which, when carefully examined with a lens, showed that\r\nthe smoke had been swept away in a system of minute concentric rings and\r\nfine striae. Specimens of such patterns, obtained by letting drops of\r\nmercury, alcohol, and water fall on to smoked glass, are thrown on the\r\nscreen, and the main characteristics are easily recognized. Such a\r\npattern corresponds to the footprints of the dance that has been\r\nperformed on the surface, and though the drop may be lying unbroken on\r\nthe plate, it has evidently been taking violent exercise, and were our\r\nvision acute enough we might observe that it was still palpitating after\r\nits exertions.\r\n\r\nA careful examination of a large number of such footprints showed that\r\nany opinion that could be formed therefrom of the nature of the motion\r\nof the drop must be largely conjectural, and it occurred to me about\r\neighteen years ago to endeavour by means of the illumination of a\r\nsuitably-timed electric spark to watch a drop through its various\r\nchanges on impact.\r\n\r\nThe reason that with ordinary continuous light nothing can be\r\nsatisfactorily seen of the splash, is not that the phenomenon is of such\r\nshort duration, but because the changes are so rapid that before the\r\nimage of one stage has faded from the eye the image of a later and quite\r\ndifferent stage is superposed upon it. Thus the resulting impression is\r\na confused assemblage of all the stages, as in the photograph of a\r\nperson who has not sat still while the camera was looking at him. The\r\nproblem to be solved experimentally was therefore this: to let a drop of\r\ndefinite size fall from a definite height in comparative darkness on to\r\na surface, and to illuminate it by a flash of exceedingly short duration\r\nat any desired stage, so as to exclude all the stages previous and\r\nsubsequent to the one thus picked out. The flash must be bright enough\r\nfor the image of what is seen to remain long enough on the eye for the\r\nobserver to be able to attend to it, and even to shift his attention\r\nfrom one part to another, and thus to make a drawing of what is seen. If\r\nnecessary the experiment must be capable of repetition, with an exactly\r\nsimilar drop falling from exactly the same height, and illuminated at\r\nexactly the same stage. Then, when this stage has been sufficiently\r\nstudied, we must be able to arrange with another similar drop to\r\nilluminate it at a rather later stage, say 1/1000 second later, and in\r\nthis way to follow step by step the whole course of the phenomenon.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus by which this has been accomplished is on the table before\r\nyou. Time will not suffice to explain how it grew out of earlier\r\narrangements very different in appearance, but its action is very simple\r\nand easy to follow by reference to the diagram (Fig. 1).\r\n\r\nAA' is a light wooden rod rather longer and thicker than an ordinary\r\nlead pencil, and pivoted on a horizontal axle O. The rod bears at the\r\nend A a small deep watch-glass, or segment of a watch-glass, whose\r\nsurface has been smoked, so that a drop even of water will lie on it\r\nwithout adhesion. The end A' carries a small strip of tinned iron, which\r\ncan be pressed against and held down by an electro-magnet CC'. When the\r\ncurrent of the electro-magnet is cut off the iron is released, and the\r\nend A' of the rod is tossed up by the action of a piece of india-rubber\r\nstretched catapult-wise across two pegs at E, and by this means the drop\r\nresting on the watch-glass is left in mid-air free to fall from rest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nBB' is a precisely similar rod worked in just the same way, but carrying\r\nat B a small horizontal metal ring, on which an ivory timing sphere of\r\nthe size of a child's marble can be supported. On cutting off the\r\ncurrent of the electro-magnet the ends A' and B' of the two levers are\r\nsimultaneously tossed up by the catapults, and thus drop and sphere\r\nbegin to fall at the same moment. Before, however, the drop reaches the\r\nsurface on which it is to impinge, the timing sphere strikes a plate D\r\nattached to one end of a third lever pivoted at Q, and thus breaks the\r\ncontact between a platinum wire bound to the underside of this lever and\r\nanother wire crossing the first at right angles. This action breaks an\r\nelectric current which has traversed a second electro-magnet F (Fig. 2),\r\nand releases the iron armature N of the lever NP, pivoted at P, thus\r\nenabling a strong spiral spring G to lift a stout brass wire L out of\r\nmercury, and to break at the surface of the mercury a strong current\r\nthat has circulated round the primary circuit of a Ruhmkorff's induction\r\ncoil; this produces at the surface of the mercury a bright\r\nself-induction spark in the neighbourhood of the splash, and it is by\r\nthis flash that the splash is viewed. The illumination is greatly helped\r\nby surrounding the place where the splash and flash are produced by a\r\nwhite cardboard enclosure, seen in Fig. 2, from whose walls the light is\r\ndiffused.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the time at which the spark is made will depend\r\nupon the distance that the sphere has to fall before striking the plate\r\nD, for the subsequent action of demagnetizing F and pulling the wire L\r\nout of the mercury in the cup H is the same on each occasion. The modus\r\noperandi is consequently as follows:--The observer, sitting in\r\ncomparative but by no means complete darkness, faces the apparatus as it\r\nappears in Fig. 2, presses down the ends A'B' of the levers first\r\ndescribed, so that they are held by the electro-magnet C (Fig. 1); then\r\nhe presses the lever NP down on the electro-magnet F, sets the timing\r\nsphere and drop in place, and then by means of a bridge between two\r\nmercury cups, short-circuits and thus cuts off the current of the\r\nelectro-magnet C. This lets off drop and sphere, and produces the flash.\r\nThe stage of the phenomenon that is thus revealed having been\r\nsufficiently studied by repetition of the experiment as often as may be\r\nnecessary, he lowers the plate D a fraction of an inch and thus obtains\r\na later stage. Not only is any desired stage of the phenomenon thus\r\neasily brought under examination, but the apparatus also affords the\r\nmeans of measuring the time interval between any two stages. All that\r\nis necessary is to know the distance that the timing sphere falls in the\r\ntwo cases. Elementary dynamics then give us the interval required. Thus,\r\nif the sphere falls one foot and we then lower D 1/4 inch, the interval\r\nbetween the corresponding stages will be about .0026 second.\r\n\r\nHaving thus described the apparatus, which I hope shortly to show you in\r\naction, I pass to the information that has been obtained by it.\r\n\r\nThis is contained in a long series of drawings, of which a selection\r\nwill be presented on the screen. The First Series that I have to show\r\nrepresents the splash of a drop of mercury 0.15 inch in diameter that\r\nhas fallen 3 inches on to a smooth glass plate. It will be noticed that\r\nvery soon after the first moment of impact, minute rays are shot out in\r\nall directions on the surface. These are afterwards overflowed or\r\nunited, until, as in Fig. 8, the outline is only slightly rippled. Then\r\n(Fig. 9) main rays shoot out, from the ends of which in some cases\r\nminute droplets of liquid would split off, to be left lying in a circle\r\non the plate, and visible in all subsequent stages. By counting these\r\ndroplets when they were thus left, the number of rays was ascertained to\r\nhave been generally about 24. This exquisite shell-like configuration,\r\nshown in Fig. 9, marks about the maximum spread of the liquid, which,\r\nsubsiding in the middle, afterwards flows into an annulus or rim with a\r\nvery thin central film, so thin, in fact, as often to tear more or less\r\nirregularly. This annular rim then divides or segments (Figs. 14, 15,\r\n16) in such a manner as to join up the rays in pairs, and thus passes\r\ninto the 12-lobed annulus of Fig. 16. Then the whole contracts, but\r\ncontracts most rapidly between the lobes, the liquid then being driven\r\ninto and feeding the arms, which follow more slowly. In Fig. 21 the end\r\nof this stage is reached, and now the arms continuing to come in, the\r\nliquid rises in the centre; this is, in fact, the beginning of the\r\nrebound of the drop from the plate. In the case before us the drops at\r\nthe ends of the arms now break off (Fig. 25), while the central mass\r\nrises in a column which just fails itself to break up into drops, and\r\nfalls back into the middle of the circle of satellites which, it will be\r\nunderstood, may in some cases again be surrounded by a second circle of\r\nthe still smaller and more numerous droplets that split off the ends of\r\nthe rays in Fig. 9. The whole of the 30 stages described are\r\naccomplished in about 1/20 second, so that the average interval between\r\nthem is about 1/600 second.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST SERIES.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 2]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 3]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 4]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 5]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 6]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 7]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 8]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 9]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 10]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 11]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 12]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 13]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 14]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 15]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 16]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 17]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 18]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 19]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 20]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 21]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 22]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 23]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 24]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 25]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 26]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 27]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 28]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 29]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 30]\r\n\r\nIt should be mentioned that it is only in rare cases that the\r\nsubordinate drops seen in the last six figures, are found lying in a\r\nvery complete circle after all is over, for there is generally some\r\nslight disturbing lateral velocity which causes many to mingle again\r\nwith the central drop, or with each other. But even if only half or a\r\nquarter of the circle is left, it is easy to estimate how many drops,\r\nand therefore how many arms there have been. It may be mentioned that\r\nsometimes the surface of the central lake of liquid (Figs. 14, 15, 16,\r\n17) was seen to be covered with beautiful concentric ripples, not shown\r\nin the figures.\r\n\r\nThe question now naturally presents itself, Why should the drop behave\r\nin this manner? In seeking the answer it will be useful to ask ourselves\r\nanother question. What should we have expected the drop to do? Well, to\r\nthis I suppose most people would be inclined, arguing from analogy with\r\na solid, to reply that it would be reasonable to expect the drop to\r\nflatten itself, and even very considerably flatten itself, and then,\r\ncollecting itself together again, to rebound, perhaps as a column such\r\nas we have seen, but not to form this regular system of rays and arms\r\nand subordinate drops.\r\n\r\nNow this argument from analogy with a solid is rather misleading, for\r\nthe forces that operate in the case of a solid sphere that flattens\r\nitself and rebounds, are due to the bodily elasticity which enables it\r\nnot only to resist, but also to recover from any distortion of shape or\r\nshearing of its internal parts past each other. But a liquid has no\r\npower of recovering from such internal shear, and the only force that\r\nchecks the spread, and ultimately causes the recovery of shape, is the\r\n_surface tension_, which arises from the fact that the surface layers\r\nare always in a state of extension and always endeavouring to contract.\r\nThus we are at liberty when dealing with the motions of the drop to\r\nthink of the interior liquid as not coherent, provided we furnish it\r\nwith a suitable elastic skin. Where the surface skin is sharply curved\r\noutwards, as it is at the sharp edge of the flattened disc, there the\r\ninterior liquid will be strongly pressed back. In fact the process of\r\nflattening and recoil is one in which energy of motion is first expended\r\nin creating fresh liquid surface, and subsequently recovered as the\r\nsurface contracts. The transformation is, however, at all moments\r\naccompanied by a great loss of energy as heat. Moreover, it must be\r\nremembered that the energy expended in creating the surface of the\r\nsatellite drops is not restored if these remain permanently separate.\r\nThus the surface tension explains the recoil, and it is also closely\r\nconnected with the formation of the subordinate rays and arms. To\r\nexplain this it is only necessary to remind you that a liquid cylinder\r\nis an unstable configuration. As you know, any fine jet becomes beaded\r\nand breaks into drops, but it is not necessary that there should be any\r\nflow of liquid along the jet; if, for example, we could realize a rod of\r\nliquid of the shape and size of this cylindrical ruler that I hold in my\r\nhand, and liberate it in the air, it would not retain its cylindrical\r\nshape, but would segment or divide itself up into a row of drops\r\nregularly disposed according to a definite and very simple numerical\r\nlaw, viz. that the distances between the centres of contiguous drops\r\nwould be equal to the circumference of the cylinder. This can be shown\r\nby calculation to be a consequence of the surface tension, and the\r\ncalculation has been closely verified by experiment. If the liquid\r\ncylinder were liberated on a plate, it would still topple into a regular\r\nrow of drops, but they would be further apart; this was shown by\r\nPlateau. Now imagine the cylinder bent into an annulus. It will still\r\nfollow the same law,[1] _i.e._ it will topple into drops just as if it\r\nwere straight. This I can show you by a direct experiment. I have here a\r\nsmall thick disc of iron, with an accurately planed face and a handle at\r\nthe back. In the face is cut a circular groove, whose cross section is a\r\nsemi-circle. I now lay this disc face downwards on the horizontal face\r\nof the lantern condenser, and through one of two small holes bored\r\nthrough to the back of the disc I fill the groove with quicksilver. Now,\r\nsuddenly lifting the disc from the plate, I release an annulus of\r\nliquid, which splits into the circle of very equal drops which you see\r\nprojected on the screen. You will notice that the main drops have\r\nbetween them still smaller ones, which have come from the splitting up\r\nof the thin cylindrical necks of liquid which connected the larger drops\r\nat the last moment.\r\n\r\nNow this tendency to segment or topple into drops, whether of a straight\r\ncylinder or of an annulus, is the key to the formation of the arms and\r\nsatellites, and indeed to much that happens in all the splashes that we\r\nshall examine. Thus in Fig. 12 we have an annular rim, which in Figs. 13\r\nand 14 is seen to topple into lobes by which the rays are united in\r\npairs, and even the special rays that are seen in Fig. 9 owe their\r\norigin to the segmentation of the rim of the thin disc into which the\r\nliquid has spread. The proceeding is probably exactly analogous to what\r\ntakes place in a sea wave that curls over in calm weather on a slightly\r\nsloping shore. Any one may notice how, as it curls over, the wave\r\npresents a long smooth edge, from which at a given instant a multitude\r\nof jets suddenly shoot out, and at once the back of the wave, hitherto\r\nsmooth, is seen to be furrowed or \"combed.\" There can be no doubt that\r\nthe cylindrical edge topples into alternate convexities and concavities;\r\nat the former the flow is helped, at the latter hindered, and thus the\r\njets begin, and special lines of flow are determined. In precisely the\r\nsame way the previously smooth circular edge of Fig. 8 topples, and\r\ndetermines the rays and lines of flow of Fig. 9.\r\n\r\nBefore going on to other splashes I will now endeavour to reproduce a\r\nmercury splash of the kind I have described, in a manner that shall be\r\nvisible to all. For this purpose I have reduplicated the apparatus which\r\nyou have seen, and have it here so arranged that I can let the drop fall\r\non to the horizontal condenser plate of the lantern, through which the\r\nlight passes upwards, to be afterwards thrown upon this screen. The\r\nilluminating flash will be made inside the lantern, where the arc light\r\nwould ordinarily be placed. I have now set a drop of mercury in\r\nreadiness and put the timing sphere in place, and now if you will look\r\nintently at the middle of the screen I will darken the room and let off\r\nthe splash. (The experiment was repeated four or five times, and the\r\nfigures seen were like those of Series X.) Of course all that can be\r\nshown in this way is the outline, or rather a horizontal section of the\r\nsplash; but you are able to recognize some of the configurations already\r\ndescribed, and will be the more willing to believe that a momentary view\r\nis after all sufficient to give much information if one is on the alert\r\nand has acquired skill by practice.\r\n\r\nThe general features of the splash that we have examined are not merely\r\ncharacteristic of the liquid mercury, but belong to all splashes of a\r\nliquid falling on to a surface which it does not wet, provided the\r\nheight of fall or size of the drop are not so great as to cause complete\r\ndisruption,[2] in which case there is no recovery and rebound. Thus a\r\ndrop of milk falling on to smoked glass will, if the height of fall and\r\nsize of drop are properly adjusted, give forms very similar to those\r\npresented by a drop of mercury. The whole course of the phenomenon\r\ndepends, in fact, mainly on four quantities only: (1) the size of the\r\ndrop; (2) the height of fall; (3) the value of the surface tension; (4)\r\nthe viscosity of the liquid.\r\n\r\nThe next series of drawings illustrates the splash of a drop of water\r\nfalling into water.\r\n\r\nIn order the better to distinguish the liquid of the original drop from\r\nthat into which it falls, the latter was coloured with ink or with an\r\naniline dye, and the drop itself was of water rendered turbid with\r\nfinely-divided matter in suspension. Finally drops of milk were found to\r\nbe very suitable for the purpose, the substitution of milk for water not\r\nproducing any observable change in the phenomenon.\r\n\r\nIn Series II. the drop fell 3 inches, and was 1/5 inch in diameter.\r\n\r\n[In most of the figures of this and of succeeding series the central\r\nwhite patch represents the original drop, and the white parts round it\r\nrepresent those raised portions of the liquid which catch the light. The\r\nnumbers under each figure give the time interval in seconds from the\r\noccurrence of the first figure, or of the figure marked [Tau] = 0.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSERIES II.\r\n\r\n_The Splash of a Drop, followed in detail by Instantaneous\r\nIllumination._\r\n\r\nDiameter of Drop, 1/5 inch.

As the drop descends the hollow becomes\r\nwider and deeper, and finally closes over the drop (Fig. 3), which,\r\nhowever, soon again emerges as the hollow flattens out, appearing first\r\nnear, but still below the surface (Fig. 4), in a flattened, lobed form,\r\nafterwards rising as a column somewhat mixed with adherent water, in\r\nwhich traces of the lobes are at first very visible.\r\n\r\nThe rising column, which is nearly cylindrical, breaks up into drops\r\nbefore or during its subsequent descent into the liquid. As it\r\ndisappears below the surface the outward and downward flow causes a\r\nhollow to be again formed, up the sides of which an annulus of milk is\r\ncarried, while the remainder descends to be torn again a second time\r\ninto a vortex ring, which, however, is liable to disturbance from the\r\nfalling in of the drops which once formed the upper part of the\r\nrebounding column.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to recognize some features of this splash without\r\nany apparatus beyond a cup of tea and a spoonful of milk. Any drinker of\r\nafternoon tea, after the tea is poured out and before the milk is put\r\nin, may let the milk fall into it drop by drop from one or two inches\r\nabove it. The rebounding column will be seen to consist almost entirely\r\nof milk, and to break up into drops in the manner described, while the\r\nvortex ring, whose core is of milk, may be seen to shoot down into the\r\nliquid. But this is better observed by dropping ink into a tumbler of\r\nclear water.\r\n\r\nLet us now increase the height of fall to 17 inches. Series III.\r\nexhibits the result. All the characteristics of the last splash are\r\nmore strongly marked. In Fig. 1 we have caught sight of the little\r\nraised rim of the hollow before it was headed, but in Fig. 2 special\r\nchannels of easiest flow have been already determined. The number of\r\nribs and rays in this basket-shaped hollow seemed to vary a good deal\r\nwith different drops, as also did the number of arms and lobes seen in\r\nlater figures, in a somewhat puzzling manner, and I made no attempt to\r\nselect drawings which are in agreement in this respect. It will be\r\nunderstood that these rays contain little or none of the liquid of the\r\ndrop, which remains collected together in the middle. Drops from these\r\nrays or from the larger arms and lobes of subsequent figures are often\r\nthrown off high into the air. In Figs. 3 and 4 the drop is clean gone\r\nbelow the surface of the hollow, which is now deeper and larger than\r\nbefore. The beautiful beaded annular edge then subsides, and in Fig. 5\r\nwe see the drop again, and in Fig. 6 it begins to emerge. But although\r\nthe drop has fallen from a greater height than in the previous splash,\r\nthe energy of the impact, instead of being expended in raising the same\r\namount of liquid to a greater height, is now spent in lifting a much\r\nthicker adherent column to about the same height as in the last splash.\r\nThere was sometimes noticed, as seen in Fig. 9, a tendency in the water\r\nto flow up past the milk, which, still comparatively unmixed with water,\r\nrides triumphant on the top of the emergent column. The greater relative\r\nthickness of this column prevents it splitting into drops, and Figs. 10\r\nand 11 show it descending below the surface to form the hollow of Fig.\r\n12, up the sides of which an annular film of milk is carried (Figs. 12\r\nand 13), having been detached from the central mass, which descends to\r\nbe torn again, this time centrally into a well-marked vortex ring.\r\n\r\n\r\nSERIES III.\r\n\r\n_The Splash of a Drop, followed in detail by Instantaneous\r\nIllumination._\r\n\r\nDiameter of Drop, 1/5 inch.

The raised rim of the\r\nprevious series is now developed into a hollow shell of considerable\r\nheight, which tends to close over the drop. This shell or dome is a\r\ncharacteristic feature of all splashes made by large drops falling from\r\na considerable height, and is extremely beautiful. In the splash at\r\npresent under consideration it does not always succeed in closing\r\npermanently, but opens out as it subsides, and is followed by the\r\nemergence of the drop (Fig. 8).

It will be\r\nobserved that the flow of liquid down the sides is chiefly along\r\ndefinite channels, which are probably determined by the arms thrown up\r\nat an earlier stage. The bubble is generally creased by the weight of\r\nthe liquid along these channels. It must be remembered that the base of\r\nthe bubble is in a state of oscillation, and that the whole is liable to\r\nburst at any moment, when such figures as 6 and 7 of the previous series\r\nwill be seen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SERIES V.\r\n\r\n_The Splash of a Drop, followed in detail by Instantaneous\r\nIllumination._\r\n\r\nThe Size of Drop and Height of Fall are the same as before, but the\r\nhollow shell (see figs. 4 and 5 of the previous Series) does not succeed\r\nin opening, but is left as a bubble on the surface. This explains the\r\nformation of bubbles when _big_ rain-drops fall into a pool of water.]\r\n\r\nSuch is the history of the building of the bubbles which big rain-drops\r\nleave on the smooth water of a lake, or pond, or puddle. Only the bigger\r\ndrops can do it, and reference to the number at the side of Fig. 5 of\r\nSeries IV. shows that the dome is raised in about two-hundredths of a\r\nsecond. Should the domes fail to close, or should they open again, we\r\nhave the emergent columns which any attentive observer will readily\r\nrecognize, and which have never been better described than by Mr. R.L.\r\nStevenson, who, in his delightful _Inland Voyage_, speaks of the surface\r\nof the Belgian canals along which he was canoeing, as thrown up by the\r\nrain into \"an infinity of little crystal fountains.\"\r\n\r\nVery beautiful forms of the same type indeed, but different in detail,\r\nare those produced by a drop of water falling into the lighter and more\r\nmobile liquid, petroleum.\r\n\r\nIt will now be interesting to turn to the splash that is produced when a\r\nsolid sphere, such as a child's marble, falls into water.\r\n\r\nI found to my great surprise that the character of the splash, at any\r\nrate up to a height of 4 or 5 feet, depends entirely on the state of the\r\nsurface of the sphere. A polished sphere of marble about 0.6 of an inch\r\nin diameter, rubbed very dry with a cloth just beforehand and dropped\r\nfrom a height of 2 feet into water, gave the figures of Series VI., in\r\nwhich it is seen that the water spreads over the sphere so rapidly, that\r\nit is sheathed with the liquid even before it has passed below the\r\ngeneral level of the surface. The splash is insignificantly small and of\r\nvery short duration.[3] If the drying and polishing be not so perfect,\r\nthe configurations of Series VII. are produced; while if the sphere be\r\nroughened with sandpaper, or _left wet_, Series VIII. is obtained, in\r\nwhich it will be perceived that, as was the case with the liquid drop,\r\nthe water is driven away laterally, forming the ribbed basket-shaped\r\nhollow, which, however, is now prolonged to a great depth, the drop\r\nbeing followed by a cone of air, while the water seems to find great\r\ndifficulty in wetting the surface completely. Part of this column of air\r\nwas carried down at least 16 inches, and then only detached when the\r\nsphere struck the bottom of the vessel.\r\n\r\n\r\nSERIES VI., VII.\r\n\r\n_Splash of a Solid Sphere (a marble 1/2 inch in diameter falling 2 feet\r\ninto water)._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SERIES VI.\r\n\r\nWhen the sphere is _dry_ and _polished_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SERIES VII.\r\n\r\nWhen the sphere is _not_ well _dried_ and _polished_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SERIES VIII.\r\n\r\n_The Splash of a Solid Sphere_--(continued.)\r\n\r\nWhen the sphere is _rough_ or _wet_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SERIES IX.\r\n\r\n_The Splash of a Solid Sphere_--(continued.)\r\n\r\nWhen the sphere is rough or wet, and falls above 5 feet.]\r\n\r\nFigs. 6 and 7 show the crater falling in, but this did not always\r\nhappen, for the walls often closed over the hollow exactly as in Figs. 4\r\nand 5 of Series IV. Meanwhile the long and nearly cylindrical portion\r\nbelow breaks up into bubbles which rise quickly to the surface.\r\n\r\nBy increasing the fall to 5 feet we obtain the figures of Series IX. The\r\ntube of Fig. 1 corresponds to the dome of Series IV. and V., and is not\r\nonly elevated to a surprising height, but is also in the act of cleaving\r\n(the outline being approximately that of the unduloid of M. Plateau).\r\nFigs. 2 and 3 show the bubble formed by the closing up of this tube,\r\nweighed down in the centre as in Figs. 5 and 6 of Series V. Similar\r\nresults were obtained with other liquids, such as petroleum and alcohol.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to show in a very striking manner the paramount influence of\r\nthe condition of the solid surface. I have here a number of similar\r\nmarbles; this set has been well polished by rubbing with wash leather. I\r\ndrop them one by one through a space of about 1 foot into this deep,\r\nwide, cylindrical glass vessel, lighted up by a lamp placed behind it.\r\nYou see each marble enters noiselessly and with hardly a visible trace\r\nof splash. Now I pick them out and drop them in again (or to save\r\ntrouble, I drop in the place of these other wet ones), everything is\r\nchanged. You see how the air is carried to the very bottom of the\r\nvessel, and you hear the \"phloisbos\" of the bubbles as they\r\nrise to the surface and burst. These dry but rough marbles behave in\r\nmuch the same way.\r\n\r\nSuch are the main features of the Natural History of Splashes, as I made\r\nit out between thirteen and eighteen years ago. Before passing on to the\r\nphotographs that I have since obtained, I desire to add a few words of\r\ncomment. I have not till now alluded to any imperfections in the timing\r\napparatus. But no apparatus of the kind can be absolutely perfect, and,\r\nas a matter of fact, when everything is adjusted so as to display a\r\nparticular stage, it will happen that in a succession of observations\r\nthere is a certain variation in what is seen. Thus the configuration\r\nviewed may be said to oscillate slightly about the mean for which the\r\napparatus is adjusted. Now this is due both to small imperfections in\r\nthe timing apparatus and to the fact that the splashes themselves do\r\nactually vary within certain limits. The reasons are not very far to\r\nseek. In the first place the rate of demagnetization of the\r\nelectro-magnets varies slightly, being partly dependent on the varying\r\nresistance of the contacts of crossed wires, partly on the temperature\r\nof the magnet, which is affected by the length of time for which the\r\ncurrent has been running. But a much more important reason is the\r\nvariation of the slight adhesion of the drop to the smoked watch-glass\r\nthat has supported it, and consequently of the oscillations to which, as\r\nwe shall see, the drop is subjected as it descends. Thus the drop will\r\nsometimes strike the surface in a flattened form, at others in an\r\nelongated form, and there will be a difference, not only in the time of\r\nimpact, but in the nature of the ensuing splash; consequently some\r\njudgment is required in selecting a consecutive series of drawings. The\r\nonly way is to make a considerable number of drawings of each stage, and\r\nthen to pick out a consecutive series. Now, whenever judgment has to be\r\nused, there is room for error of judgment, and moreover, it is\r\nimpossible to put together the drawings so as to tell a consecutive\r\nstory, without being guided by some theory, such as I have already\r\nsketched, as to the nature of the motion and the conditions that govern\r\nit. You will therefore be good enough to remember that this chronicle of\r\nthe events of a tenth of a second is not a mechanical record but is\r\npresented by a fallible human historian, whose account, like that of\r\nany other contemporary observer, will be none the worse for independent\r\nconfirmation. That confirmation is fortunately obtainable. In an attempt\r\nmade eighteen years ago to photograph the splash of a drop of mercury, I\r\nwas unable to procure plates sufficiently sensitive to respond to the\r\nvery short exposures that were required, and consequently abandoned the\r\nendeavour. But in recent years plates of exquisite sensitiveness have\r\nbeen produced, and such photographs as those taken by Mr. Boys of a\r\nflying rifle bullet have shown that difficulties on the score of\r\nsensitiveness have been practically overcome. Within the last few weeks,\r\nwith the valuable assistance of my colleague at Devonport, Mr. R.S.\r\nCole, I have succeeded in obtaining photographs of various splashes.\r\nFollowing Prof. Boys' suggestion, we employed Thomas's cyclist plates,\r\nor occasionally the less sensitive \"extra-rapid\" plates of the same\r\nmakers, and as a developer, Eikonogen solution of triple strength, in\r\nwhich the plates were kept for about 40 minutes, the development being\r\nconducted in complete darkness.\r\n\r\nA few preliminary trials with the self-induction spark produced at the\r\nsurface of mercury by the apparatus that you have seen at work, showed\r\nthat the illumination, though ample for direct vision, was not\r\nsufficient for photography. When the current strength was increased, so\r\nas to make the illumination bright enough for the camera, then the spark\r\nbecame of too great duration, for it lasted for between 4 and 5\r\nthousandths of a second, within which time there was very perceptible\r\nmotion of the drop and consequent blurring. It was therefore necessary\r\nto modify the apparatus so as to employ a Leyden-jar spark whose\r\nduration was probably less than 10-millionths of a second. A very\r\nslight change in the apparatus rendered it suitable for the new\r\nconditions, but time does not permit me to describe the arrangements in\r\ndetail. It is, however, less necessary to do so as the method is in all\r\nessentials the same as that described in this room two years ago by Lord\r\nRayleigh in connection with the photography of a breaking soap-film.[4]\r\nI therefore pass at once to the photographs themselves.\r\n\r\nThe first two series (X. and XI.) may be described as shadow\r\nphotographs; they were obtained by allowing a drop of mercury to fall on\r\nto the naked photographic plate itself, the illuminating spark being\r\nproduced vertically above it, and they give only a horizontal section of\r\nthe drop in various stages, revealing the form of the outline of the\r\npart in contact with the plate, but of course telling nothing about the\r\nshape of the parts above. The first series corresponds to a mercury\r\nsplash very similar to that first described, and the second to the\r\nsplash of a larger drop such as was not described. In each series, the\r\ntearing of the thin central film to which allusion was made is well\r\nillustrated. I think the first comment that any one would make is that\r\nthe photographs, while they bear out the drawings in many details, show\r\ngreater irregularity than the drawings would have led one to expect. On\r\nthis point I shall presently have something to say.\r\n\r\n\r\nSERIES X.\r\n\r\n(1) _Instantaneous Shadow Photographs (life size) of the Splash of a\r\nDrop of Mercury falling 8 cm. on to the Photographic Plate._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1\r\n\r\nActual size of the Drop, 4.83 mm.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 2\r\n\r\n[Tau] = 0]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 3]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 4]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 5]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 6]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 7\r\n\r\n[Tau] = .048 sec.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSERIES XI.\r\n\r\n(2) _Instantaneous Shadow Photographs (life size) of the Splash of a\r\nDrop of Mercury falling 15 cm. on to Glass._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1\r\n\r\nActual size, 4.83 mm. in diameter.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 2\r\n\r\n[Tau] = 0 sec.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 3]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 4\r\n\r\n4A\r\n\r\n[Tau] = .0032 sec.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 5\r\n\r\n[Tau] = .0063 sec.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 5A\r\n\r\n[Tau] = .0094 sec.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 6\r\n\r\n[Tau] = .0134 sec.]\r\n\r\nComparing the first set of drawings (pp. 20-24) with the photographs of\r\nSeries X., it will be seen that\r\n\r\n  Photograph 2 corresponds to drawing 4 or 5\r\n      \"      3     \"             \"    9\r\n      \"      4     \"             \"   18\r\n      \"      6     \"             \"   20\r\n      \"      7     \"             \"   24\r\n\r\nbut the irregularity of the last photograph almost masks the\r\nresemblance.\r\n\r\n\r\nSERIES XII.\r\n\r\n_Engravings from Instantaneous Photographs (16/17 of the real size) of\r\nthe Splash of a Drop of Mercury, 4.83 mm. in diameter, falling 8.9 cm.\r\non to a hard polished surface._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 2\r\n\r\n[Tau] = 0 sec.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 3]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 4]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 5]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 6\r\n\r\n[Tau] = .0195 sec.]\r\n\r\nSeries XII. gives an objective view of a mercury splash as taken by the\r\ncamera. Only the first of this series shows any detail in the interior.\r\nThe polished surface of the mercury is, in fact, very troublesome to\r\nilluminate, and this splash proved the most difficult of all to\r\nphotograph.\r\n\r\nSeries XIII. shows the splash of a drop of milk falling on to a smoked\r\nglass plate, on which it runs about without adhesion just as mercury\r\nwould. Here there is more of detail. In Fig. 4 the central film is so\r\nthin in the middle that the black plate beneath it is seen through the\r\nliquid. In Fig. 8 this film has been torn.\r\n\r\nSeries XIV. exhibits the splash of a water drop falling into milk. The\r\nfirst four photographs show the oscillations of the drop about a mean\r\nspherical figure as it approaches the surface.\r\n\r\nIn the subsequent figures it will be noticed that the arms which are\r\nthrown up at first, afterwards segment into drops which fly off and\r\nsubside (see Fig. 8), to be followed by a second series which again\r\nsubside (Fig. 11), to be again succeeded by a third set. In fact, so\r\nlong as there is any downward momentum the drop and the air behind it\r\nare penetrating the liquid, and so long must there be an upward flow of\r\ndisplaced liquid. Much of this flow is seen to be directed into the arms\r\nalong the channels determined by the segmentation of the annular rim.\r\nThis reproduction of the lobes and arms time after time on a varying\r\nscale goes far to explain the puzzling variations in their number which\r\nI mentioned in connection with the drawings. I had not, indeed,\r\nsuspected this, which is one of the few new points that the photographs\r\nhave so far revealed.[5]\r\n\r\n\r\nSERIES XIII.\r\n\r\n_Engravings of Instantaneous Photographs (16/17 of the real size) of the\r\nSplash of a Drop of Milk falling 20 cm. on to smoked glass._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 2\r\n\r\n[Tau] = 0 sec.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 3\r\n\r\n[Tau] = .0025 sec.]\r\n\r\n(It was not found possible to reproduce satisfactorily the missing\r\nfigures of this series.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 7\r\n\r\n[Tau] = .0128 sec.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 8\r\n\r\n[Tau] = .0149 sec.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 9\r\n\r\n[Tau] = .0149 sec.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSERIES XIV.\r\n\r\n_Engravings of Instantaneous Photographs of the Splash of a Drop of\r\nWater falling 40 cm. into Milk._\r\n\r\nScale about 6/10 of actual size.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 2]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 3]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 4\r\n\r\n[Tau] = 0 sec.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 5]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 6\r\n\r\n[Tau] = .0056 sec.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 7\r\n\r\n[Tau] = .0163 sec.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 8]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 9\r\n\r\n[Tau] = .0182 sec.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 10\r\n\r\n[Tau] = .0197 sec.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 11\r\n\r\n[Tau] = .0262 sec.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 12\r\n\r\n[Tau] = .0391 sec.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 13\r\n\r\n[Tau] = .0514 sec.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 14\r\n\r\n[Tau] = .0601 sec.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 15]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 16\r\n\r\n[Tau] = .080 sec.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 17]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 18\r\n\r\n[Tau] = .101 sec.]\r\n\r\nWith respect to these photographs,[6] the credit of which I hope you\r\nwill attribute firstly to the inventors of the sensitive plates, and\r\nsecondly to the skill and experience of Mr. Cole, I desire to add that\r\nthey are, as far as we know, the first really detailed objective views\r\nthat have been obtained with anything approaching so short an exposure.\r\n\r\nEven Mr. Boys' wonderful photographs of flying bullets were after all\r\nbut shadow-photographs, and did not so strikingly illustrate the\r\nextreme sensitiveness of the plates, and I want you to distinguish\r\nbetween such and what (to borrow Mr. F.J. Smith's phrase) I call an\r\n\"objective view.\"\r\n\r\nIt remains only to speak of the greater irregularity in the arms and\r\nrays as shown by the photographs. The point is a curious and interesting\r\none. In the first place I have to confess that in looking over my\r\noriginal drawings I find records of many irregular or unsymmetrical\r\nfigures, yet in compiling the history it has been inevitable that these\r\nshould be rejected, if only because identical irregularities never\r\nrecur. Thus the mind of the observer is filled with an ideal splash--an\r\n\"Auto-Splash\"--whose perfection may never be actually realized.\r\n\r\nBut in the second place, when the splash is nearly regular it is very\r\ndifficult to detect irregularity. This is easily proved by projecting\r\non the screen with instantaneous illumination such a photograph as that\r\nof Series X., Fig. 6. My experience is that most persons pronounce what\r\nthey have seen to be a regular and symmetrical star-shaped figure, and\r\nthey are surprised when they come to examine it by detail in continuous\r\nlight to find how far this is from the truth. Especially is this the\r\ncase if no irregularity is suspected beforehand. I believe that the\r\nobserver, usually finding himself unable to attend to more than a\r\nportion of the rays in the system, is liable instinctively to pick out\r\nfor attention a part of the circumference where they are regularly\r\nspaced, and to fill up the rest in imagination, and that where a ray may\r\nbe really absent he prefers to consider that it has been imperfectly\r\nviewed.\r\n\r\nThis opinion is confirmed by the fact that in several cases, I have\r\nbeen able to observe with the naked eye a splash that was also\r\nsimultaneously photographed, and have made the memorandum \"quite\r\nregular,\" though the photograph subsequently showed irregularity. It\r\nmust, however, be observed that the absolute darkness and other\r\nconditions necessary for photography are not very favourable for direct\r\nvision.\r\n\r\nAnd now my tale is told, or rather as much of it as the limits of the\r\ntime allowed me will permit. I think you will agree that the phenomena\r\nare very beautiful, and that the subject, commonplace and familiar\r\nthough it is, has yet proved worthy of an hour's attention.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Richard Clay & Sons, Limited, London & Bungay._\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] See Worthington on the \"Spontaneous Segmentation of a Liquid\r\nAnnulus,\" _Proceedings Royal Society_, No. 200, p. 49 (1879).\r\n\r\n[2] Readers who wish a more detailed account of a greater variety of\r\nsplashes are referred to papers by the author. _Proceedings Royal\r\nSociety_, vol. xxv. pp. 261 and 498 (1877); and vol. xxxiv. p. 217\r\n(1882).\r\n\r\n[3] Photographs obtained since this was written show that much may\r\nhappen after the stages here traced.\r\n\r\n[4] A detailed account of the optical, mechanical, and electrical\r\narrangements employed, written by Mr. Cole, will be found in _Nature_,\r\nvol. i., p. 222 (July 5, 1894).\r\n\r\n[5] The black streaks, seen especially in Figs. 11, 15, and 16, are due\r\nto particles of lamp-black carried down by the drop from the surface of\r\nthe smoked watch-glass on which it rested.\r\n\r\n[6] Three of these photographs, viz.
