These\r\nessays, though they have no bearing upon the life of the fly, are\r\namong the most interesting that Henri Fabre has written and will, I am\r\npersuaded, make a special appeal to the reader. The chapter entitled The\r\nCaddis Worm has been included as following directly upon The Pond.\r\n\r\nSince publishing The Life of the Spider, I was much struck by a passage\r\nin Dr. Chalmers Mitchell's stimulating work, The Childhood of Animals,\r\nin which the secretary of the Zoological Society of London says: 'I have\r\nattempted to avoid the use of terms familiar only to students of zoology\r\nand to refrain from anatomical detail, but at the same time to refrain\r\nfrom the irritating habit assuming that my readers have no knowledge, no\r\ndictionaries and no other books.'\r\n\r\nI began to wonder whether I had gone too far in simplifying the\r\nterminology of the Fabre essays and in appending explanatory footnotes\r\nto the inevitable number of outlandish names of insects. But my doubts\r\nvanished when I thought upon Fabre's own words in the first chapter of\r\nthis book: 'If I write for men of learning, for philosophers...I write\r\nabove all things for the young. I want to make them love the natural\r\nstory which you make them hate; and that is why, while keeping strictly\r\nto the domain of truth, I avoid your scientific prose, which too often,\r\nalas, seems borrowed from some Iroquois idiom!'\r\n\r\nAnd I can but apologize if I have been too lavish with my notes to this\r\nchapter in particular, which introduces to us, as in a sort of litany,\r\na multitude of the insects studied by the author. For the rest, I have\r\ncontinued my system of references to the earlier Fabre books, whether\r\ntranslated by myself or others. Of the following essays, The Harmas has\r\nappeared, under another title, in The Daily Mail; The Pond, Industrial\r\nChemistry and the two Chapters on the bluebottle in The English Review;\r\nand The Harmas, The Pond and Industrial Chemistry in the New York\r\nBookman. The others are new to England and America, unless any of them\r\nshould be issued in newspapers or magazines between this date and the\r\npublication of the book.\r\n\r\nI wish once more to thank Miss Frances Rodwell for her assistance in the\r\ndetails of my work and in the verification of the many references; and\r\nmy thanks are also due to Mr. Edward Cahen, who has been good enough to\r\nrevise the two chemistry chapters for me, and to Mr. W. S. Graff Baker,\r\nwho has performed the same kindly task towards the two chapters entitled\r\nMathematical Memories.--Alexander Teixeira de Mattos. Chelsea, 8 July,\r\n1913.\r\n\r\n[Recorder's Note: Most Translator's Footnotes have been omitted from\r\nthis text, but some of his references to localities and insect names\r\nare included in brackets. I apologize to English readers for changes to\r\nAmerican spelling.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. THE HARMAS\r\n\r\nThis is what I wished for, hoc erat in votis: a bit of land, oh, not so\r\nvery large, but fenced in, to avoid the drawbacks of a public way; an\r\nabandoned, barren, sun scorched bit of land, favored by thistles and by\r\nwasps and bees. Here, without fear of being troubled by the passersby, I\r\ncould consult the Ammophila and the Sphex [two digger or hunting wasps]\r\nand engage in that difficult conversation whose questions and answers\r\nhave experiment for their language; here, without distant expeditions\r\nthat take up my time, without tiring rambles that strain my nerves,\r\nI could contrive my plans of attack, lay my ambushes and watch their\r\neffects at every hour of the day. Hoc erat in votis. Yes, this was my\r\nwish, my dream, always cherished, always vanishing into the mists of the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nAnd it is no easy matter to acquire a laboratory in the open fields,\r\nwhen harassed by a terrible anxiety about one's daily bread. For forty\r\nyears have I fought, with steadfast courage, against the paltry plagues\r\nof life; and the long-wished-for laboratory has come at last. What it\r\nhas cost me in perseverance and relentless work I will not try to say.\r\nIt has come; and, with it--a more serious condition--perhaps a little\r\nleisure. I say perhaps, for my leg is still hampered with a few links of\r\nthe convict's chain.\r\n\r\nThe wish is realized. It is a little late, O my pretty insects! I\r\ngreatly fear that the peach is offered to me when I am beginning to\r\nhave no teeth wherewith to eat it. Yes, it is a little late: the wide\r\nhorizons of the outset have shrunk into a low and stifling canopy, more\r\nand more straitened day by day. Regretting nothing in the past, save\r\nthose whom I have lost; regretting nothing, not even my first youth;\r\nhoping nothing either, I have reached the point at which, worn out by\r\nthe experience of things, we ask ourselves if life be worth the living.\r\n\r\nAmid the ruins that surround me, one strip of wall remains standing,\r\nimmovable upon its solid base: my passion for scientific truth. Is that\r\nenough, O my busy insects, to enable me to add yet a few seemly pages\r\nto your history? Will my strength not cheat my good intentions? Why,\r\nindeed, did I forsake you so long? Friends have reproached me for it.\r\nAh, tell them, tell those friends, who are yours as well as mine,\r\ntell them that it was not forgetfulness on my part, not weariness, nor\r\nneglect: I thought of you; I was convinced that the Cerceris [a digger\r\nwasp] cave had more fair secrets to reveal to us, that the chase of the\r\nSphex held fresh surprises in store. But time failed me; I was alone,\r\ndeserted, struggling against misfortune. Before philosophizing, one had\r\nto live. Tell them that; and they will pardon me.\r\n\r\nOthers again have reproached me with my style, which has not the\r\nsolemnity, nay, better, the dryness of the schools. They fear lest a\r\npage that is read without fatigue should not always be the expression\r\nof the truth. Were I to take their word for it, we are profound only\r\non condition of being obscure. Come here, one and all of you--you, the\r\nsting bearers, and you, the wing-cased armor-clads--take up my defense\r\nand bear witness in my favor. Tell of the intimate terms on which I live\r\nwith you, of the patience with which I observe you, of the care with\r\nwhich I record your actions. Your evidence is unanimous: yes, my pages,\r\nthough they bristle not with hollow formulas nor learned smatterings,\r\nare the exact narrative of facts observed, neither more nor less; and\r\nwhoever cares to question you in his turn will, obtain the same replies.\r\n\r\nAnd then, my dear insects, if you cannot convince those good people,\r\nbecause you do not carry the weight of tedium, I, in my turn, will say\r\nto them: 'You rip up the animal and I study it alive; you turn it into\r\nan object of horror and pity, whereas I cause it to be loved; you labor\r\nin a torture chamber and dissecting room, I make my observations under\r\nthe blue sky to the song of the cicadas, you subject cell and protoplasm\r\nto chemical tests, I study instinct in its loftiest manifestations;\r\nyou pry into death, I pry into life. And why should I not complete\r\nmy thought: the boars have muddied the clear stream; natural history,\r\nyouth's glorious study, has, by dint of cellular improvements, become a\r\nhateful and repulsive thing. Well, if I write for men of learning, for\r\nphilosophers, who, one day, will try to some extent to unravel the tough\r\nproblem of instinct, I write also, I write above all things for the\r\nyoung. I want to make them love the natural history which you make them\r\nhate; and that is why, while keeping strictly to the domain of truth, I\r\navoid your scientific prose, which too often, alas seems borrowed from\r\nsome Iroquois idiom.\r\n\r\nBut this is not my business for the moment: I want to speak of the\r\nbit of land long cherished in my plans to form a laboratory of living\r\nentomology, the bit of land which I have at last obtained in the\r\nsolitude of a little village. It is a harmas, the name given, in this\r\ndistrict [the country round Serignan, in Provence], to an untilled,\r\npebbly expanse abandoned to the vegetation of the thyme. It is too poor\r\nto repay the work of the plow; but the sheep passes there in spring,\r\nwhen it has chanced to rain and a little grass shoots up.\r\n\r\nMy harmas, however, because of its modicum of red earth swamped by a\r\nhuge mass of stones, has received a rough first attempt at cultivation:\r\nI am told that vines once grew here. And, in fact, when we dig the\r\nground before planting a few trees, we turn up, here and there, remains\r\nof the precious stock, half carbonized by time. The three pronged fork,\r\ntherefore, the only implement of husbandry that can penetrate such\r\na soil as this, has entered here; and I am sorry, for the primitive\r\nvegetation has disappeared. No more thyme, no more lavender, no more\r\nclumps of kermes oak, the dwarf oak that forms forests across which we\r\nstep by lengthening our stride a little. As these plants, especially the\r\nfirst two, might be of use to me by offering the Bees and Wasps a spoil\r\nto forage, I am compelled to reinstate them in the ground whence they\r\nwere driven by the fork.\r\n\r\nWhat abounds without my mediation is the invaders of any soil that is\r\nfirst dug up and then left for a long time to its own resources. We\r\nhave, in the first rank, the couch grass, that execrable weed which\r\nthree years of stubborn warfare have not succeeded in exterminating.\r\nNext, in respect of number, come the centauries, grim looking one\r\nand all, bristling with prickles or starry halberds. They are the\r\nyellow-flowered centaury, the mountain centaury, the star thistle and\r\nthe rough centaury: the first predominates. Here and there, amid their\r\ninextricable confusion, stands, like a chandelier with spreading, orange\r\nflowers for lights, the fierce Spanish oyster plant, whose spikes are\r\nstrong as nails. Above it, towers the Illyrian cotton thistle, whose\r\nstraight and solitary stalk soars to a height of three to six feet and\r\nends in large pink tufts. Its armor hardly yields before that of the\r\noyster plant. Nor must we forget the lesser thistle tribe, with first\r\nof all, the prickly or 'cruel' thistle, which is so well armed that the\r\nplant collector knows not where to grasp it; next, the spear thistle,\r\nwith its ample foliage, ending each of its veins with a spear head;\r\nlastly, the black knapweed, which gathers itself into a spiky knot.\r\nIn among these, in long lines armed with hooks, the shoots of the blue\r\ndewberry creep along the ground. To visit the prickly thicket when the\r\nWasp goes foraging, you must wear boots that come to mid-leg or else\r\nresign yourself to a smarting in the calves. As long as the ground\r\nretains a few remnants of the vernal rains, this rude vegetation does\r\nnot lack a certain charm, when the pyramids of the oyster plant and the\r\nslender branches of the cotton thistle rise above the wide carpet formed\r\nby the yellow-flowered centaury saffron heads; but let the droughts of\r\nsummer come and we see but a desolate waste, which the flame of a match\r\nwould set ablaze from one end to the other. Such is, or rather was,\r\nwhen I took possession of it, the Eden of bliss where I mean to live\r\nhenceforth alone with the insect. Forty years of desperate struggle have\r\nwon it for me.\r\n\r\nEden, I said; and, from the point of view that interests me, the\r\nexpression is not out of place. This cursed ground, which no one would\r\nhave had at a gift to sow with a pinch of turnip seed, is an earthly\r\nparadise for the bees and wasps. Its mighty growth of thistles and\r\ncentauries draws them all to me from everywhere around. Never, in my\r\ninsect hunting memories, have I seen so large a population at a single\r\nspot; all the trades have made it their rallying point. Here come\r\nhunters of every kind of game, builders in clay, weavers of cotton\r\ngoods, collectors of pieces cut from a leaf or the petals of a flower,\r\narchitects in pasteboard, plasterers mixing mortar, carpenters\r\nboring wood, miners digging underground galleries, workers handling\r\ngoldbeater's skin and many more.\r\n\r\nWho is this one? An Anthidium [a tailor bee]. She scrapes the cobwebby\r\nstalk of the yellow-flowered centaury and gathers a ball of wadding\r\nwhich she carries off proudly in the tips of her mandibles. She will\r\nturn it, under ground, into cotton felt satchels to hold the store of\r\nhoney and the egg. And these others, so eager for plunder? They are\r\nMegachiles [leaf-cutting bees], carrying under their bellies their\r\nblack, white or blood red reaping brushes. They will leave the thistles\r\nto visit the neighboring shrubs and there cut from the leaves oval\r\npieces which will be made into a fit receptacle to contain the harvest.\r\nAnd these, clad in black velvet? They are Chalicodomae [mason bees], who\r\nwork with cement and gravel. We could easily find their masonry on the\r\nstones in the harmas. And these noisily buzzing with a sudden flight?\r\nThey are the Anthophorae [wild bees], who live in the old walls and the\r\nsunny banks of the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nNow come the Osmiae. One stacks her cells in the spiral staircase of an\r\nempty snail shell; another, attacking the pith of a dry bit of bramble,\r\nobtains for her grubs a cylindrical lodging and divides it into floors\r\nby means of partition walls; a third employs the natural channel of a\r\ncut reed; a fourth is a rent-free tenant of the vacant galleries of\r\nsome mason bee. Here are the Macrocerae and the Eucerae, whose males are\r\nproudly horned; the Dasypodae, who carry an ample brush of bristles on\r\ntheir hind legs for a reaping implement; the Andrenae, so manifold in\r\nspecies; the slender-bellied Halicti [all wild bees]. I omit a host of\r\nothers. If I tried to continue this record of the guests of my thistles,\r\nit would muster almost the whole of the honey yielding tribe. A learned\r\nentomologist of Bordeaux, Professor Perez, to whom I submit the naming\r\nof my prizes, once asked me if I had any special means of hunting,\r\nto send him so many rarities and even novelties. I am not at all an\r\nexperienced and, still less, a zealous hunter, for the insect interests\r\nme much more when engaged in its work than when struck on a pin in a\r\ncabinet. The whole secret of my hunting is reduced to my dense nursery\r\nof thistles and centauries.\r\n\r\nBy a most fortunate chance, with this populous family of honey gatherers\r\nwas allied the whole hunting tribe. The builders' men had distributed\r\nhere and there in the harmas great mounds of sand and heaps of stones,\r\nwith a view to running up some surrounding walls. The work dragged on\r\nslowly; and the materials found occupants from the first year. The mason\r\nbees had chosen the interstices between the stones as a dormitory where\r\nto pass the night, in serried groups. The powerful eyed lizard, who,\r\nwhen close pressed, attacks both man and dog, wide mouthed, had selected\r\na cave wherein to lie in wait for the passing scarab [a dung beetle\r\nalso known as the sacred beetle]; the black-eared chat, garbed like a\r\nDominican, white-frocked with black wings, sat on the top stone,\r\nsinging his short rustic lay: his nest, with its sky blue eggs, must be\r\nsomewhere in the heap. The little Dominican disappeared with the loads\r\nof stones. I regret him: he would have been a charming neighbor. The\r\neyed lizard I do not regret at all.\r\n\r\nThe sand sheltered a different colony. Here, the Bembeces [digger wasps]\r\nwere sweeping the threshold of their burrows, flinging a curve of dust\r\nbehind them; the Languedocian Sphex was dragging her Ephippigera [a\r\ngreen grasshopper] by the antennae; a Stizus [a hunting wasp] was\r\nstoring her preserves of Cicadellae [froghoppers]. To my sorrow, the\r\nmasons ended by evicting the sporting tribe; but, should I ever wish to\r\nrecall it, I have but to renew the mounds of sand: they will soon all be\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nHunters that have not disappeared, their homes being different, are the\r\nAmmophilae, whom I see fluttering, one in spring, the others in autumn,\r\nalong the garden walks and over the lawns, in search of a caterpillar;\r\nthe Pompili [digger or hunting wasp], who travel alertly, beating their\r\nwings and rummaging in every corner in quest of a spider. The largest\r\nof them waylays the Narbonne Lycosa [known also as the black-bellied\r\ntarantula], whose burrow is not infrequent in the harmas. This burrow is\r\na vertical well, with a curb of fescue grass intertwined with silk. You\r\ncan see the eyes of the mighty Spider gleam at the bottom of the den\r\nlike little diamonds, an object of terror to most. What a prey and what\r\ndangerous hunting for the Pompilus! And here, on a hot summer afternoon,\r\nis the Amazon ant, who leaves her barrack rooms in long battalions and\r\nmarches far afield to hunt for slaves. We will follow her in her raids\r\nwhen we find time. Here again, around a heap of grasses turned to mould,\r\nare Scoliae [large hunting wasps] an inch and a half long, who fly\r\ngracefully and dive into the heap, attracted by a rich prey, the grubs\r\nof Lamellicorns, Orycotes and Ceotoniae [various beetles].\r\n\r\nWhat subjects for study! And there are more to come. The house was as\r\nutterly deserted as the ground. When man was gone and peace assured, the\r\nanimal hastily seized on everything. The warbler took up his abode in\r\nthe lilac shrubs; the greenfinch settled in the thick shelter of the\r\ncypresses; the sparrow carted rags and straw under every slate; the\r\nSerin finch, whose downy nest is no bigger than half an apricot, came\r\nand chirped in the plane tree tops; the Scops made a habit of uttering\r\nhis monotonous, piping note here, of an evening; the bird of Pallas\r\nAthene, the owl, came hurrying along to hoot and hiss.\r\n\r\nIn front of the house is a large pond, fed by the aqueduct that supplies\r\nthe village pumps with water. Here, from half a mile and more around,\r\ncome the frogs and Toads in the lovers' season. The natterjack,\r\nsometimes as large as a plate, with a narrow stripe of yellow down his\r\nback, makes his appointments here to take his bath; when the evening\r\ntwilight falls, we see hopping along the edge the midwife toad, the\r\nmale, who carries a cluster of eggs, the size of peppercorns, wrapped\r\nround his hindlegs: the genial paterfamilias has brought his precious\r\npacket from afar, to leave it in the water and afterwards retire under\r\nsome flat stone, whence he will emit a sound like a tinkling bell.\r\nLastly, when not croaking amid the foliage, the tree frogs indulge in\r\nthe most graceful dives. And so, in May, as soon as it is dark, the\r\npond becomes a deafening orchestra: it is impossible to talk at table,\r\nimpossible to sleep. We had to remedy this by means perhaps a little\r\ntoo rigorous. What could we do? He who tries to sleep and cannot needs\r\nbecomes ruthless.\r\n\r\nBolder still, the wasp has taken possession of the dwelling house. On my\r\ndoor sill, in a soil of rubbish, nestles the white-banded Sphex: when\r\nI go indoors, I must be careful not to damage her burrows, not to tread\r\nupon the miner absorbed in her work. It is quite a quarter of a century\r\nsince I last saw the saucy cricket hunter. When I made her acquaintance,\r\nI used to visit her at a few miles' distance: each time, it meant an\r\nexpedition under the blazing August sun. Today, I find her at my door;\r\nwe are intimate neighbors. The embrasure of the closed window provides\r\nan apartment of a mild temperature for the Pelopaeus [a mason wasp]. The\r\nearth-built nest is fixed against the freestone wall. To enter her home,\r\nthe spider huntress uses a little hole left open by accident in the\r\nshutters. On the moldings of the Venetian blinds, a few stray mason\r\nbees build their group of cells; inside the outer shutters, left ajar, a\r\nEumenes [a mason wasp] constructs her little earthen dome, surmounted by\r\na short, bell-mouthed neck. The common wasp and the Polistes [a solitary\r\nwasp] are my dinner guests: they visit my table to see if the grapes\r\nserved are as ripe as they look.\r\n\r\nHere, surely--and the list is far from complete--is a company both\r\nnumerous and select, whose conversation will not fail to charm my\r\nsolitude, if I succeed in drawing it out. My dear beasts of former days,\r\nmy old friends, and others, more recent acquaintances, all are here,\r\nhunting, foraging, building in close proximity. Besides, should we wish\r\nto vary the scene of observation, the mountain [Ventoux] is but a\r\nfew hundred steps away, with its tangle of arbutus, rock roses and\r\narborescent heather; with its sandy spaces dear to the Bembeces; with\r\nits marly slopes exploited by different wasps and bees. And that is why,\r\nforeseeing these riches, I have abandoned the town for the village and\r\ncome to Serignan to weed my turnips and water my lettuces.\r\n\r\nLaboratories are being founded, at great expense, on our Atlantic and\r\nMediterranean coasts, where people cut up small sea animals, of but\r\nmeager interest to us; they spend a fortune on powerful microscopes,\r\ndelicate dissecting instruments, engines of capture, boats, fishing\r\ncrews, aquariums, to find out how the yolk of an Annelid's egg is\r\nconstructed, a question whereof I have never yet been able to grasp the\r\nfull importance; and they scorn the little land animal, which lives\r\nin constant touch with us, which provides universal psychology with\r\ndocuments of inestimable value, which too often threatens the public\r\nwealth by destroying our crops. When shall we have an entomological\r\nlaboratory for the study not of the dead insect, steeped in alcohol, but\r\nof the living insect; a laboratory having for its object the instinct,\r\nthe habits, the manner of living, the work, the struggles, the\r\npropagation of that little world, with which agriculture and philosophy\r\nhave most seriously to reckon?\r\n\r\nTo know thoroughly the history of the destroyer of our vines might\r\nperhaps be more important than to know how this or that nerve fiber of\r\na Cirriped [sea animals with hair-like legs, including the barnacles and\r\nacorn shells] ends; to establish by experiment the line of demarcation\r\nbetween intellect and instinct; to prove, by comparing facts in the\r\nzoological progression, whether human reason be an irreducible faculty\r\nor not: all this ought surely to take precedence of the number of joints\r\nin a Crustacean's antenna. These enormous questions would need an army\r\nof workers; and we have not one. The fashion is all for the Mollusk\r\nand the Zoophytes [plant-like sea animals, including starfishes,\r\njellyfishes, sea anemones and sponges]. The depths of the sea are\r\nexplored with many drag nets; the soil which we tread is consistently\r\ndisregarded. While waiting for the fashion to change, I open my harmas\r\nlaboratory of living entomology; and this laboratory shall not cost the\r\nratepayers one farthing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. THE ANTHRAX\r\n\r\nI made the acquaintance of the Anthrax in 1855 at Carpentras, at the\r\ntime when the life history of the oil beetles was causing me to search\r\nthe tall slopes beloved of the Anthophora bees [mason bees]. Her curious\r\npupae, so powerfully equipped to force an outlet for the perfect\r\ninsect incapable of the least effort, those pupae armed with a multiple\r\nplowshare at the fore, a trident at the rear and rows of harpoons on the\r\nback wherewith to rip open the Osmia bee's cocoon and break through\r\nthe hard crust of the hillside, betokened a field that was worth\r\ncultivating. The little that I said about her at the time brought me\r\nurgent entreaties: I was asked for a circumstantial chapter on the\r\nstrange fly. The stern necessities of life postponed to an ever\r\nretreating future my beloved investigations, so miserably stifled.\r\nThirty years have passed; at last, a little leisure is at hand; and\r\nhere, in the harmas of my village, with an ardor that has in no wise\r\ngrown old, I have resumed my plans of yore, still alive like the coal\r\nsmoldering under the ashes. The Anthrax has told me her secrets, which I\r\nin my turn am going to divulge. Would that I could address all those who\r\ncheered me on this path, including first and foremost the revered Master\r\nof the Landes [Leon Dufour]. But the ranks have thinned, many have been\r\npromoted to another world and their disciple lagging behind them can but\r\nrecord, in memory of those who are no more, the story of the insect clad\r\nin deepest mourning.\r\n\r\nIn the course of July, let us give a few sideward knocks to the bracing\r\npebbles and detach the nests of the Chalicodoma of the Walls [a mason\r\nbee] from their supports. Loosened by the shock, the dome comes off\r\ncleanly, all in one piece. Moreover--and this is a great advantage--the\r\ncells come into view wide open on the base of the exposed nest, for at\r\nthis point they have no other wall than the surface of the pebble. In\r\nthis way, without any scraping, which would be wearisome work for the\r\noperator and dangerous to the inhabitants of the dome, we have all the\r\ncells before our eyes, together with their contents, consisting of a\r\nsilky, amber-yellow cocoon, as delicate and translucent as an onion\r\npeeling. Let us split the dainty wrapper with the scissors, chamber by\r\nchamber, nest by nest. If fortune be at all propitious, as it always is\r\nto the persevering, we shall end by finding that the cocoons harbor two\r\nlarvae together, one more or less faded in appearance, the other fresh\r\nand plump. We shall also find some, no less plentiful, in which the\r\nwithered larva is accompanied by a family of little grubs wriggling\r\nuneasily around it.\r\n\r\nExamination at once reveals the tragedy that is happening under the\r\ncover of the cocoon. The flacid and faded larva is the mason bee's.\r\nA month ago, in June, having finished its mess of honey, it wove its\r\nsilken sheath for a bedchamber wherein to take the long sleep which is\r\nthe prelude to the metamorphosis. Bulging with fat, it is a rich and\r\ndefenseless morsel for whoever is able to reach it. Then, in spite\r\nof apparently insurmountable obstacles, the mortar wall and the tent\r\nwithout an opening, the flesh-eating larvae appeared in the secret\r\nretreat and are now glutting themselves on the sleeper. Three different\r\nspecies take part in the carnage, often in the same nest, in adjoining\r\ncells. The diversity of shapes informs us of the presence of more than\r\none enemy; the final stage of the creatures will tell us the names and\r\nqualities of the three invaders.\r\n\r\nForestalling the secrets of the future for the sake of greater\r\nclearness, I will anticipate the actual facts and come at once to the\r\nresults produced. When it is by itself on the body of the mason bee's\r\nlarva, the murderous grub belongs either to Anthrax trifasciata, MEIGEN,\r\nor to Leucospis gigas, FAB. But, if numerous little worms, often a score\r\nand more, swarm around the victim, then it is a Chalcidid's family which\r\nwe have before us. Each of these ravagers shall have its biography. Let\r\nus begin with the Anthrax.\r\n\r\nAnd first the grub, as it is after consuming its victim, when it remains\r\nthe sole occupant of the mason bee's cocoon. It is a naked worm, smooth,\r\nlegless and blind, of a creamy dead white, each segment a perfect ring,\r\nvery much curved when at rest, but with the tendency to become\r\nalmost straight when disturbed. Through the diaphanous skin, the lens\r\ndistinguishes patches of fat, which are the cause of its characteristic\r\ncoloring. When younger, as a tiny grub a few millimeters long, it is\r\nstreaked with two different kinds of stains, some white, opaque and of a\r\ncreamy tint, others translucent and of the palest amber. The former\r\ncome from adipose masses in course of formation; the second from the\r\nnourishing fluid or from the blood which laves those masses.\r\n\r\nIncluding the head, I count thirteen segments. In the middle of the body\r\nthese segments are well marked, being separated by a slight groove; but\r\nin the forepart they are difficult to count. The head is small and is\r\nsoft, like the rest of the body, with no sign of any mouth parts even\r\nunder the close scrutiny of the lens. It is a white globule, the size\r\nof a tiny pin's head and continued at the back by a pad a little larger,\r\nfrom which it is separated by a scarcely appreciable crease. The whole\r\nis a sort of nipple swelling slightly on the upper surface; and its\r\ndouble structure is so difficult to perceive that at first we take it\r\nfor the animal's head alone, though it includes both the head and the\r\nprothorax, or first segment of the thorax.\r\n\r\nThe mesothorax, or middle segment of the thorax, which is two or three\r\ntimes larger in diameter, is flattened in front and separated from the\r\nnipple formed by the prothorax and the head by a deep, narrow, curved\r\nfissure. On its front surface are two pale red stigmata, or respiratory\r\norifices, placed pretty close together. The metathorax, or last segment\r\nof the thorax, is a little larger still in diameter and protrudes.\r\nThese abrupt increases in circumference result in a marked hump, sloping\r\nsharply towards the front. The nipple of which the head forms part is\r\nset at the bottom of this hump.\r\n\r\nAfter the metathorax, the shape becomes regular and cylindrical, while\r\ndecreasing slightly in girth in the last two or three segments. Close to\r\nthe line of separation of the last two rings, I am able to distinguish,\r\nnot without difficulty, two very small stigmata, just a little darker\r\nin color. They belong to the last segment. In all, four respiratory\r\norifices, two in front and two behind, as is the rule among Flies. The\r\nlength of the full sized larva is 15 to 20 millimeters and its breadth 5\r\nto 6.\r\n\r\nRemarkable in the first place by the protuberance of its thorax and\r\nthe smallness of its head, the grub of the Anthrax acquires exceptional\r\ninterest by its manner of feeding. Let us begin by observing that,\r\ndeprived of all, even the most rudimentary walking apparatus, the animal\r\nis absolutely incapable of shifting its position. If I disturb its rest,\r\nit curves and straightens itself in turns by a series of contractions,\r\nit tosses about violently where it lies, but does not manage to\r\nprogress. It fidgets and gets no farther. We shall see later the\r\nmagnificent problem raised by this inertness.\r\n\r\nFor the moment, a most unexpected fact claims all our attention. I refer\r\nto the extreme readiness with which the Anthrax' larva quits and returns\r\nto the Chalicodoma grub on which it is feeding. After witnessing flesh\r\neating larvae at hundreds and hundreds of meals, I suddenly find myself\r\nconfronted with a manner of eating that bears no relation to anything\r\nwhich I have seen before. I feel myself in a world that baffles my old\r\nexperience. Let us recall the table manners of a larva living on prey,\r\nthe Ammophila's for instance, when devouring its caterpillar. A hole is\r\nmade in the victim's side; and the head and neck of the nursling dive\r\ndeep into the wound, to root luxuriously among the entrails. There is\r\nnever a withdrawal from the gnawed belly, never a recoil to interrupt\r\nthe feast and to take breath awhile. The vivacious animal always goes\r\nforward, chewing, swallowing, digesting, until the caterpillar's skin is\r\nemptied of its contents. Once seated at table, it does not budge as long\r\nas the victuals last. To tease it with a straw is not always enough\r\nto induce it to withdraw its head outside the wound; I have to use\r\nviolence. When removed by force and then left to its own devices, the\r\ncreature hesitates for a long time, stretches itself and mouths around,\r\nwithout trying to open a passage through a new wound. It needs the\r\nattacking point that has just been abandoned. If it finds the spot,\r\nit makes its way in and resumes the work of eating; but its future is\r\njeopardized from this time forward, for the game, now perhaps tackled at\r\ninopportune points, is liable to go bad.\r\n\r\nWith the Anthrax' grub, there is none of this mangling, none of this\r\npersistent clinging to the entrance wound. I have but to tease it with\r\nthe tip of a hair pencil and forthwith it retires; and the lens reveals\r\nno wound at the abandoned spot, no such effusion of blood as there would\r\nbe if the skin were perforated. When its sense of security is restored,\r\nthe grub once more applies its pimple head to the fostering larva,\r\nat any point, no matter where; and, so long as my curiosity does not\r\nprevent it, keeps itself fixed there, without the least effort, or the\r\nleast perceptible movement that could account for the adhesion. If I\r\nrepeat the touch with the pencil, I see the same sudden retreat and,\r\nsoon after, the same contact just as readily renewed.\r\n\r\nThis facility for gripping, quitting and regripping, now here, now\r\nthere and always without a wound, the part of the victim whence the\r\nnourishment is drawn tells us of itself that the mouth of the Anthrax\r\nis not armed with mandibular fangs capable of digging into the skin and\r\ntearing it. If the flesh were gashed by any such pincers, one or two\r\nattempts would be necessary before they could be released or reapplied;\r\nbesides, each point bitten would display a lesion. Well, there is\r\nnothing of the kind: a conscientious examination through the magnifying\r\nglass shows conclusively that the skin is intact; the grub glues\r\nits mouth to its prey or withdraws it with an ease that can only be\r\nexplained by a process of simple contact. This being so, the Anthrax\r\ndoes not chew its food as do the other carnivorous grubs; it does not\r\neat, it inhales.\r\n\r\nThis method of taking nourishment implies an exceptional apparatus of\r\nthe mouth, into which it behooves us to inquire before continuing. My\r\nmost powerful magnifying glass at last discovers, at the center of the\r\npimple head, a small spot of an amber-russet color; and that is all. For\r\na more exhaustive examination we will employ the microscope. I cut off\r\nthe strange pimple with the scissors, wash it in a drop of water and\r\nplace it on the object slide. The mouth now stands revealed as a round\r\nspot which, for hue and for the smallness of its size, may be compared\r\nwith the front stigmata. It is a small conical crater, with sides of a\r\npale yellowish-red and with faint, more or less concentric lines. At the\r\nbottom of this funnel is the opening of the gullet, itself tinted red in\r\nfront and promptly spreading into a cone at the back. There is not the\r\nslightest trace of mandibular fangs, of jaws, of mouth parts for seizing\r\nand grinding. Everything is reduced to the bowl shaped opening, with a\r\ndelicate lining of horny texture, as is shown by the amber hue and\r\nthe concentric streaks. When I look for some term to designate this\r\ndigestive entrance, of which so far I know no other example, I can find\r\nonly that of a sucker or cupping glass. Its attack is a mere kiss, but\r\nwhat a perfidious kiss!\r\n\r\nWe know the machine; now let us see the working. To facilitate\r\nobservation, I shifted the newborn Anthrax grub, together with the\r\nChalicodoma grub, its wet nurse, from the natal cell into a glass tube.\r\nI was thus able, by employing as many tubes as I wanted, to follow from\r\nstart to finish, in all its most intimate details, the strange repast\r\nwhich I am going to describe.\r\n\r\nThe worm is fixed by its sucker to any convenient part of the nurse,\r\nplump and fat as butter. It is ready to break off its kiss suddenly,\r\nshould anything disquiet it, and to resume it as easily when\r\ntranquillity is restored. No Lamb enjoys greater liberty with its\r\nmother's teat. After three or four days of this contact of the nurse and\r\nnursling, the former, at first replete and endowed with the glossy skin\r\nthat is a sign of health, begins to assume a withered aspect. Her sides\r\nfall in, her fresh color fades, her skin becomes covered with little\r\nfolds and gives evidence of an appreciable shrinking in this breast\r\nwhich, instead of milk, yields fat and blood. A week is hardly past\r\nbefore the progress of the exhaustion becomes startlingly rapid. The\r\nnurse is flabby and wrinkled, as though borne down by her own weight,\r\nlike a very slack object. If I move her from her place, she flops and\r\nsprawls like a half-filled water bottle over the new supporting plane.\r\nBut the Anthrax' kiss goes on emptying her: soon she is but a sort of\r\nshriveled lard bag, decreasing from hour to hour, from which the sucker\r\ndraws a few last oily drains. At length, between the twelfth and the\r\nfifteenth day, all that remains of the larva of the mason bee is a white\r\ngranule, hardly as large as a pin's head.\r\n\r\nThis granule is the water bottle drained to the last drop, is the\r\nnurse's breast emptied of all its contents. I soften the meager remnant\r\nin water; then, keeping it still immersed, I blow into it through\r\nan extremely attenuated glass tube. The skin fills out, distends and\r\nresumes the shape of the larva, without there being an outlet anywhere\r\nfor the compressed air. It is intact, therefore; it is free of any\r\nperforation, which would be forthwith revealed under the water by an\r\nescape of gas. And so, under the Anthrax' cupping glass, the oily bottle\r\nhas been drained by a simple transpiration through the membrane; the\r\nsubstance of the nurse grub has been transfused into the body of the\r\nnursling by a process akin to that known in physics as endosmosis. What\r\nshould we say to a method of being suckled by the mere application of\r\nthe mouth to a teatless breast? What we see here may be compared with\r\nthat: without any outlet, the milk of the Chalicodoma grub passes into\r\nthe stomach of the Anthrax' larva.\r\n\r\nIs it really an instance of endosmosis? Might it not rather be\r\natmospheric pressure that stimulates the flow of nourishing fluids and\r\ndistils them into the Anthrax' cup-shaped mouth, working, in order to\r\ncreate a vacuum, almost like the suckers of the Cuttlefish? All this\r\nis possible, but I shall refrain from deciding, preferring to assign a\r\nlarge share to the unknown in this extraordinary method of nutrition.\r\nIt ought, I think, to provide physiologists with a field of research\r\nin which new views on the hydrodynamics of live fluids might well be\r\ngleaned; and this field trenches upon others that would also yield\r\nrich harvests. The brief span of my days compels me to set the problem\r\nwithout seeking to solve it.\r\n\r\nAnd the second problem is this: the Chalicodoma grub destined to feed\r\nthe Anthrax is without a wound of any kind. The mother of the tiny larva\r\nis a feeble Fly deprived of whatsoever weapon capable of injuring her\r\noffspring's prey. Moreover, she is absolutely powerless to penetrate the\r\nmason bee's fortress, powerless as a fluff of down against a rock. On\r\nthis point there is no doubt: the future wet nurse of the Anthrax has\r\nnot been paralyzed as are the live provisions collected by the Hunting\r\nWasps; she has received no bite nor scratch nor contusion of any sort;\r\nshe has experienced nothing out of the common: in short, she is in her\r\nnormal state. The billeted nursling arrives, we shall presently see how;\r\nhe arrives, scarcely visible, almost defying the scrutiny of the lens;\r\nand, having made his preparations, he installs himself, he, the atom,\r\nupon the monstrous nurse, whom he is to drain to the very husk. And she,\r\nnot paralyzed by a preliminary vivisection, endowed with all her normal\r\nvitality, lets him have his way, lets herself be sucked dry, with the\r\nutmost apathy. Not a tremor in her outraged flesh, not a quiver of\r\nresistance. No corpse could show greater indifference to the bite which\r\nit receives.\r\n\r\nAh, but the maggot has chosen the hour of attack with traitorous\r\ncunning! Had it appeared upon the scene earlier, when the larva was\r\nconsuming its store of honey, things of a surety would have gone badly\r\nwith it. The assaulted one, feeling herself bled to death by that\r\nravenous kiss, would have protested with much wriggling of body and\r\ngrinding of mandibles. The position would have ceased to be tenable\r\nand the intruder would have perished. But at this hour all danger has\r\ndisappeared. Enclosed in its silken tent, the larva is seized with the\r\nlethargy that precedes the metamorphosis. Its condition is not death,\r\nbut neither is it life. It is an intermediary condition; it is almost\r\nthe latent vitality of grain or egg. Therefore there is no sign of\r\nirritation on the larva's part under the needle with which I stir it and\r\nstill less under the sucker of the Anthrax grub, which is able to drain\r\nthe affluent breast in perfect safety.\r\n\r\nThis lack of resistance, induced by the torpor of the transformation,\r\nappears to me necessary, in view of the weakness of the nursling as it\r\nleaves the egg, whenever the mother is herself incapable of depriving\r\nthe victim of the power of self defense. And so the nonparalyzed larvae\r\nare attacked during the period of the nymphosis. We shall soon see other\r\ninstances of this.\r\n\r\nMotionless though it be, the Chalicodoma grub is none the less alive.\r\nThe primrose tint and the glossy skin are unequivocal signs of health:\r\nWere it really dead, it would, in less than twenty-four hours, turn a\r\ndirty brown and, soon after, decompose into a fluid putrescence. Now\r\nhere is the marvelous thing: during the fortnight, roughly, that the\r\nAnthrax' meal lasts, the butter color of the larva, an unfailing symptom\r\nof the presence of life, continues unaltered and does not change into\r\nbrown, the sign of putrefaction, until hardly anything remains; and even\r\nthen the brown hue is often absent. As a rule, the look of live flesh is\r\npreserved until the final pellet, formed of the skin, the sole residue,\r\nmakes its appearance. This pellet is white, with not a speck of tainted\r\nmatter, proving that life persists until the body is reduced to nothing.\r\n\r\nWe here witness the transfusion of one animal into another, the change\r\nof Chalicodoma substance into Anthrax substance; and, as long as the\r\ntransfusion is not complete, as long as the eaten has not disappeared\r\naltogether and become the eater, the ruined organism fights against\r\ndestruction. What manner of life is this, which may be compared with\r\nthe life of a night light whose extinction is not accomplished until\r\nthe last drop of oil has burnt away? How is any creature able to fight\r\nagainst the final tragedy of corruption up to the last moment in which a\r\nnucleus of matter remains as the seat of vital energy? The forces of the\r\nliving creature are here dissipated not through any disturbance of\r\nthe equilibrium of those forces, but for the want of any point of\r\napplication for them: the larva dies because materially there is no more\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nCan we be in the presence of the diffusive life of the plant, a life\r\nwhich persists in a fragment? By no means: the grub is a more delicate\r\norganic structure. There is unity between the several parts; and none of\r\nthem can be jeopardized without involving the ruin of the others. If I\r\nmyself give the larva a wound, if I bruise it, the whole body very soon\r\nturns brown and begins to rot. It dies and decomposes by the mere prick\r\nof a needle; it keeps alive, or at least preserves the freshness of\r\nthe live tissues, so long as it is not entirely emptied by the Anthrax'\r\nsucker. A nothing kills it; an atrocious wasting does not. No, I fail to\r\nunderstand the problem; and I bequeath it to others.\r\n\r\nAll that I can see by way of a glimpse--and even then I put forward my\r\nsuspicions with extreme reserve--all that I am permitted to surmise is\r\nreduced to this: the substance of the sleeping larva as yet has no very\r\ndefinite static existence; it is like the raw materials collected for a\r\nbuilding; it is waiting for the elaboration that is to make a bee of it.\r\nTo mould those shapeless lumps of the future insect, the air, that prime\r\nadjuster of living things, circulates among them, passing through a\r\nnetwork of ducts. To organize them, to direct the placing of them, the\r\nnervous system, the embryo of the animal, distributes its ramifications\r\nover them. Nerve and air duct, therefore, are the essentials; the rest\r\nis so much material in reserve for the process of the metamorphosis. As\r\nlong as that material is not employed, as long as it has not acquired\r\nits final equilibrium, it can grow less and less; and life, though\r\nlanguishing, will continue all the same on the express condition that\r\nthe respiratory organs and the nervous filaments be respected. It is as\r\nit were the flame of the lamp, which, whether full or empty, continues\r\nto give light so long as the wick is soaked in oil. Nothing but fluids,\r\nthe plastic materials held in reserve, can be distilled by the\r\nAnthrax' sucker through the unpierced skin of the grub; no part of the\r\nrespiratory and nervous systems passes. As the two essential functions\r\nremain unscathed, life goes on until exhaustion is completed. On the\r\nother hand, if I myself injure the larva, I disturb the nervous or air\r\nconducting filaments; and the bruised part spreads a taint, followed by\r\nputrefaction, all over the body.\r\n\r\nI have elsewhere, speaking of the Scolia [a digger wasp] devouring the\r\nCetonia grub, enlarged upon this refined art of eating which consists\r\nin consuming the prey while killing it only at the last mouthfuls. The\r\nAnthrax has the same requirements as his competitors who dine off fresh\r\nviands. He needs meat of that day, taken from a single joint that has to\r\nlast a fortnight without going bad. His method of consuming reaches the\r\nhighest level of art: he does not cut into his prey, he sips it little\r\nby little through his sucker. In this way, any dangerous risk is\r\naverted. Whether he imbibe at this spot or at that, even if he abandon\r\nthe sucking process and resume it later, by no accident can he ever\r\nattack that which it is incumbent upon him to respect lest corruption\r\nsupervene. The others have a fixed position on the victim, a place at\r\nwhich their mandibles have to bite and enter. If they move away from\r\nit, if they miss the appointed path, they imperil their existence. The\r\nAnthrax, more highly favored, puts his mouth where it suits him; he\r\nleaves off when he pleases and when he pleases starts again.\r\n\r\nUnless I labor under a delusion, I think that I see the necessity for\r\nthis privilege. The egg of the carnivorous burrower is firmly fixed on\r\nthe victim at a point which varies considerably, it is true, according\r\nto the nature of the prey, but which is uniform for the same species\r\nof prey; moreover--and this is an important condition--the point of\r\nadhesion of that egg is always the head, whereas the egg of a bee, of\r\nthe Osmia, for instance, is fixed to the mess of honey by the hinder\r\nend. When hatched, the new born Wasp grub has not to choose for itself,\r\nat its risk and peril, the suitable point at which to take the first cut\r\nin the quarry without fear of killing it too quickly: all that it need\r\ndo is to bite at the spot where it has just been born. The mother, with\r\nher unfailing instinct, has already made the dangerous choice; she has\r\nstuck her egg on the propitious spot and, by the very act of doing so,\r\nmarked out the course for the inexperienced grub to follow. The tact of\r\nripe age here guides the young larva's behavior at table.\r\n\r\nThe conditions are very different in the Anthrax' case. The egg is not\r\nplaced upon the victuals, it is not even laid in the mason bee's cell.\r\nThis is the natural consequence of the mother's feeble frame and of her\r\nlack of any instrument, such as a probe or auger, capable of piercing\r\nthe mortar wall. It is for the newly hatched grub to make its own way\r\ninto the dwelling. It enters, finds itself in the presence of ample\r\nprovisions, the larva of the mason bee. Free of its actions, it is at\r\nliberty to attack the prey where it chooses; or rather the attacking\r\npoint will be decided at haphazard by the first contact of the mouth\r\nin quest of food. Grant this mouth a set of carving tools, jaws and\r\nmandibles; in short, suppose the grub of the Fly to possess a manner of\r\neating similar to that of the other carnivorous larvae; and the nursling\r\nis at once threatened with a speedy death. He will split open his\r\nnurse's belly, he will dig without any rule to guide him, he will bite\r\nat random, essentials as well as accessories; and, from one day to the\r\nnext, he will set up gangrene in the violated mass, even as I myself do\r\nwhen I give it a wound. For the lack of an attacking point prescribed\r\nfor him at birth, he will perish on the damaged provisions. His freedom\r\nof action will have killed him.\r\n\r\nCertainly, liberty is a noble attribute, even in an insignificant grub;\r\nbut it also has its dangers everywhere. The Anthrax escapes the peril\r\nonly on the condition of being, so to speak, muzzled. His mouth is not a\r\nfierce forceps that tears asunder; it is a sucker that exhausts but does\r\nnot wound. Thus restrained by this safety appliance, which changes the\r\nbite into a kiss, the grub has fresh victuals until it has finished\r\ngrowing, although it knows nothing of the rules of methodical\r\nconsumption at a fixed point and in a predetermined direction.\r\n\r\nThe considerations which I have set forth seem to me strictly logical:\r\nthe Anthrax, owing to the very fact that he is free to take his\r\nnourishment where he pleases on the body of the fostering larva, must,\r\nfor his own protection, be made incapable of opening his victim's body.\r\nI am so utterly convinced of this harmonious relation between the eater\r\nand the eaten that I do not hesitate to set it up as a principle. I\r\nwill therefore say this: whenever the egg of any kind of insect is not\r\nfastened to the larva destined for its food, the young grub, free to\r\nselect the attacking point and to change it at will, is as it were\r\nmuzzled and consumes its provisions by a sort of suction, without\r\ninflicting any appreciable wound. This restriction is essential to the\r\nmaintenance of the victuals in good condition. My principle is already\r\nsupported by examples many and various, whose depositions are all to the\r\nsame effect. The witnesses include, after the Anthrax, the Leucospis\r\n[a parasitic insect] and his rivals, whose evidence we shall hear\r\npresently; the Ephialtes mediator [an Ichneumon fly], who feeds, in\r\nthe dry brambles, on the larva of the Black Psen [a digger wasp]; the\r\nMyodites, that strange, fly-shaped beetle whose grub consumes the larva\r\nof the cockchafer. All--flies, ichneumon flies and beetles--scrupulously\r\nspare their foster mother; they are careful not to tear her skin, so\r\nthat the vessel may keep its liquid good to the last.\r\n\r\nThe wholesomeness of the victuals is not the only condition imposed:\r\nI find a second, which is no less essential. The substance of the\r\nfostering larva must be sufficiently fluid to ooze through the unbroken\r\nskin under the action of the sucker. Well, the necessary fluidity is\r\nrealized as the time of the metamorphosis draws near. When they wished\r\nMedea to restore Pelias to the vigor of youth, his daughters cut the old\r\nking's body to pieces and boiled it in a cauldron, for there can be no\r\nnew existence without a prior dissolution. We must pull down before\r\nwe can rebuild; the analysis of death is the first step towards the\r\nsynthesis of life. The substance of the grub that is to be transformed\r\ninto a bee begins, therefore, by disintegrating and dissolving into\r\na fluid broth. The materials of the future insect are obtained by a\r\ngeneral recasting. Even as the founder puts his old bronzes into the\r\nmelting pot in order afterwards to cast them in a mould whence the metal\r\nwill issue in a different shape, so life liquefies the grub, a mere\r\ndigesting machine, now thrown aside, and out of its running matter\r\nproduces the perfect insect, bee, butterfly or beetle, the final\r\nmanifestation of the living creature.\r\n\r\nLet us open a Chalicodoma grub under the microscope, during the period\r\nof torpor. Its contents consists almost entirely of a liquid broth, in\r\nwhich swim numberless oily globules and a fine dust of uric acid, a sort\r\nof off-throw of the oxidized tissues. A flowing thing, shapeless and\r\nnameless, is all that the animal is, if we add abundant ramified air\r\nducts, some nervous filaments and, under the skin, a thin layer\r\nof muscular fibers. A condition of this kind accounts for a fatty\r\ntranspiration through the skin when the Anthrax' sucker is at work. At\r\nany other time, when the larva is in the active period or else when the\r\ninsect has reached the perfect stage, the firmness of the tissues would\r\nresist the transfusion and the suckling of the Anthrax would become a\r\ndifficult matter, or even impossible. In point of fact, I find the grub\r\nof the fly established, in the vast majority of cases, on the sleeping\r\nlarva and sometimes, but rarely, on the pupa. Never do I see it on the\r\nvigorous larva eating its honey; and hardly ever on the insect brought\r\nto perfection, as we find it enclosed in its cell all through the autumn\r\nand winter. And we can say the same of the other grub eaters that drain\r\ntheir victims without wounding them: all are engaged in their death\r\ndealing work during the period of torpor, when the tissues are\r\nfluidified. They empty their patient, who has become a bag of running\r\ngrease with a diffused life; but not one, among those I know, reaches\r\nthe Anthrax' perfection in the art of extraction.\r\n\r\nNor can any be compared with the Anthrax as regards the means brought\r\ninto play in order to leave the cell. These others, when they become\r\nperfect insects, have implements for sapping and demolishing, stout\r\nmandibles, capable of digging the ground, of pulling down clay partition\r\nwalls and even of reducing the mason bee's tough cement to powder. The\r\nAnthrax, in her final form, has nothing like this. Her mouth is a short,\r\nsoft proboscis, good at most for soberly licking the sugary exudations\r\nof the flowers; her slim legs are so feeble that to move a grain of\r\nsand were an excessive task for them, enough to strain every joint; her\r\ngreat, stiff wings, which must remain full spread, do not allow her to\r\nslip through a narrow passage; her delicate suit of downy velvet, from\r\nwhich you take the bloom by merely breathing on it, could not withstand\r\nthe rough contact of the gallery of a mine. Unable herself to enter the\r\nMason bee's cell to lay her egg, she cannot leave it either, when the\r\ntime comes to free herself and appear in broad daylight in her wedding\r\ndress. The larva, on its side, is powerless to prepare the way for\r\nthe coming flight. That buttery little cylinder, owning no tools but a\r\nsucker so flimsy that it barely arrives at substance and so small that\r\nit is almost a geometrical point, is even weaker than the adult insect,\r\nwhich at least flies and walks. The Mason bee's cell represents to it\r\na granite cave. How to get out? The problem would be insoluble to those\r\ntwo incapables, if nothing else played its part.\r\n\r\nAmong insects, the nymph, or pupa, the transition stage between the\r\nlarval and the adult form, is generally a striking picture of every\r\nweakness of a budding organism. A sort of mummy tight bound in swaddling\r\nclothes, motionless and impassive, it awaits the resurrection. Its\r\ntender tissues flow in every direction; its limbs, transparent as\r\ncrystal, are held fixed in their place, along the side, lest a\r\nmovement should disturb the exquisite delicacy of the work in course\r\nof accomplishment. Even so, to secure his recovery, is a broken boned\r\npatient held captive in the surgeon's bandages. Absolute stillness is\r\nnecessary in both cases, lest they be crippled or even die.\r\n\r\nWell, here, by a strange inversion that confuses all our views on life,\r\na Cyclopean task is laid upon the nymph of the Anthrax. It is the nymph\r\nthat has to toil, to strive, to exhaust itself in efforts to burst the\r\nwall and open the way out. To the embryo falls the desperate duty, which\r\nshows no mercy to the nascent flesh; to the adult insect the joy of\r\nresting in the sun. This transposition of functions has as its result\r\na well sinker's equipment in the nymph, an eccentric, complicated\r\nequipment which nothing suggested in the larva and which nothing recalls\r\nin the perfect insect. The set of tools includes an assortment of\r\nplowshares, gimlets, hooks and spears and of other implements that are\r\nnot found in our trades nor named in our dictionaries. Let us do our\r\nbest to describe the strange piercing gear.\r\n\r\nIn a fortnight at most, the Anthrax has consumed the Chalicodoma grub,\r\nwhereof naught remains but the skin, gathered into a white granule. By\r\nthe time that July is nearly over, it becomes rare to find any nurslings\r\nleft upon their nurses. From this period until the following May,\r\nnothing fresh happens. The Anthrax retains its larval shape without any\r\nappreciable change and lies motionless in the mason bee's cocoon, beside\r\nthe pellet remains. When the fine days of May arrive, the grub shrivels\r\nand casts its skin and the nymph appears, fully clad in a stout,\r\nreddish, horny hide.\r\n\r\nThe head is round and large, separated from the thorax by a strangulated\r\nfurrow, crowned on top and in front with a sort of diadem of six hard,\r\nsharp, black spikes, arranged in a semicircle whose concave side faces\r\ndownward. These spikes decrease slightly in length from the summit to\r\nthe ends of the arch. Taken together, they suggest the radial crowns\r\nwhich we see the Roman emperors of the Decadence wear on the medals.\r\nThis six-fold plowshare is the chief excavating tool. Lower down, on the\r\nmedian line, the instrument is finished off with a separate group of two\r\nsmall black spikes, placed close together.\r\n\r\nThe thorax is smooth, the wing cases large, folded under the body like\r\na scarf and coming almost to the middle of the abdomen. This has nine\r\nsegments, of which four, starting with the second, are armed, on the\r\nback, down the middle, with a belt of little horny arches, pale brown in\r\ncolor, drawn up parallel to one another, set in the skin by their\r\nconvex surfaces and finishing at both ends with a hard, black point.\r\nAltogether, the belt thus forms a double row of little thorns, with a\r\nhollow in between. I count about twenty-five twin-toothed arches to one\r\nsegment, which gives a total of two hundred spikes for the four rings\r\nthus armed.\r\n\r\nThe use of this rasp, or grater, is obvious: it gives the nymph a\r\npurchase on the wall of its gallery as the work proceeds. Thus anchored\r\non a host of points, the stern pioneer is able to hit the obstacle\r\nharder with its diadem of awls. Moreover, to make it more difficult for\r\nthe instrument to recoil, long, stiff bristles, pointing backwards,\r\nare scattered here and there among the climbing belts. There are some\r\nbesides on the other segments, both on the ventral and the dorsal\r\nsurface. On the flanks, they are thicker and arranged as it were in\r\nclusters.\r\n\r\nThe sixth segment carries a similar belt, but a much less powerful one,\r\nconsisting of a single row of unassuming thorns. The belt is weaker\r\nstill on the seventh segment; lastly, on the eighth, it is reduced to a\r\nmere rough brown shading. Commencing with the sixth, the rings decrease\r\nin width and the abdomen ends in a cone, the extremity of which, formed\r\nof the ninth segment, constitutes a weapon of a new kind. It is a sheaf\r\nof eight brown spikes. The last two exceed the others in length and\r\nstand out from the group in a double terminal plowshare.\r\n\r\nThere is a round air hole in front, on either side of the thorax, and\r\nsimilar stigmata on the flanks of each of the first seven abdominal\r\nsegments. When at rest, the nymph is curved into a bow. When about to\r\nact, it suddenly unbends and straightens itself. It measures 15 to 20\r\nmillimeters long and 4 to 5 millimeters across.\r\n\r\nSuch is the strange perforating machine that is to prepare an outlet\r\nfor the feeble Anthrax through the Mason bee's cement. The structural\r\ndetails, so difficult to explain in words, may be summed up as follows:\r\nin front, on the forehead, a diadem of spikes, the ramming and digging\r\ntool; behind, a many bladed plowshare which fits into a socket and\r\nallows the pupa to slacken suddenly in readiness for an attack on the\r\nbarrier which has to be demolished; on the back, four climbing belts, or\r\ngraters, which keep the animal in position by biting on the walls of the\r\ntunnel with their hundreds of teeth; and, all over the body, long, stiff\r\nbristles, pointing backwards, to prevent falls or recoils.\r\n\r\nA similar structure exists in the other species of Anthrax with slight\r\nvariations of detail. I will confine myself to one instance, that of\r\nAnthrax sinuata, who thrives at the cost of Osmia tricornis. Her nymph\r\ndiffers from that of Anthrax trifasciata, the Anthrax of the mason bee,\r\nin possessing less powerful armor. Its four climbing belts consist of\r\nonly fifteen to seventeen double spiked arches, instead of twenty-five;\r\nalso, the abdominal segments, from the sixth onwards, are supplied\r\nmerely with stiff bristles, without a trace of horny spikes. If the\r\nevolution of the various Anthrax flies were better known to us,\r\nthe number of these arches would, I believe, be of great service\r\nto entomology in the differentiation of species. I see it remaining\r\nconstant for any given species, with marked variations between one\r\nspecies and another. But this is not my business: I merely call the\r\nattention of the classifiers to this field of study and pass on.\r\n\r\nAbout the end of May, the coloring of the nymph, hitherto a light red,\r\nalters greatly and forecasts the coming transformation. The head, the\r\nthorax and the scarf formed by the wings become a handsome, shiny black.\r\nA dark band shows on the back of the four segments with their two rows\r\nof spikes; three spots appear on the two next rings; the anal armor\r\nbecomes darker. In this manner we foresee the black livery of the coming\r\ninsect. The time has arrived for the pupa to work at the exit gallery.\r\n\r\nI was anxious to see it in action, not under natural conditions, which\r\nwould be impracticable, but in a glass tube in which I confine it\r\nbetween two thick stoppers of sorghum pith. The space thus marked off\r\nis about the same size as the natal cell. The partitions front and back,\r\nalthough not so stout as the Chalicodoma's masonry, are nevertheless\r\nfirm enough not to yield except to prolonged efforts; on the other hand,\r\nthe side walls are smooth and the toothed belts will not be able to grip\r\nthem: a most unfavorable condition for the worker. No matter: in the\r\nspace of a single day, the pupa pierces the front partition, three\r\nquarters of an inch thick. I see it fixing its double plowshare against\r\nthe back partition, arching into a bow and then suddenly releasing\r\nitself and striking the plug in front of it with its barbed forehead.\r\nUnder the impact of the spikes, the sorghum slowly crumbles to pieces.\r\nIt is slow in coming away; but it comes away all the same, atom by atom.\r\nAt long intervals, the method changes. With its crown of awls driven\r\ninto the pith, the animal frets and fidgets, sways on the pivot of its\r\nanal armor. The work of the auger follows that of the pickaxe. Then the\r\nblows recommence, interspersed with periods of rest to recover from the\r\nfatigue. At last, the hole is made. The pupa slips into it, but does not\r\npass through entirely: the head and thorax appear outside; the abdomen\r\nremains held in the gallery.\r\n\r\nThe glass cell, with its lack of supports at the side, has certainly\r\nperplexed my subject, which does not seem to have made use of all its\r\nmethods. The hole through the sorghum is wide and irregular; it is\r\na clumsy breach and not a gallery. When made through the mason bee's\r\nwalls, it is cylindrical, fairly neat and exactly of the animal's\r\ndiameter. So I hope that, under natural conditions, the pupa does not\r\ngive quite so many blows with the pickaxe and prefers to work with the\r\ndrill.\r\n\r\nNarrowness and evenness in the exit tunnel are necessary to it. It\r\nalways remains half caught in it and even pretty securely fixed by the\r\ngraters on its back. Only the head and thorax emerge into the outer air.\r\nThis is a last precaution for the final deliverance. A fixed support is,\r\nin fact, indispensable to the Anthrax for issuing from her horny sheath,\r\nunfurling her great wings and extricating her slender legs from their\r\nscabbards. All this very delicate work would be endangered by any lack\r\nof steadiness.\r\n\r\nThe pupa, therefore, remains fixed by the graters of its back in the\r\nnarrow exit gallery and thus supplies the stable equilibrium essential\r\nto the new birth. All is ready. It is time now for the great act. A\r\ntransversal cleft makes its appearance on the forehead, at the bottom\r\nof the perforating diadem; a second, but longitudinal slit divides the\r\nskull in two and extends down the thorax. Through this cross-shaped\r\nopening, the Anthrax suddenly appears, all moist with the humors of\r\nlife's laboratory. She steadies herself upon her trembling legs, dries\r\nher wings and takes to flight, leaving at the window of the cell\r\nher nymphal slough, which keeps intact for a very long period. The\r\nsand-colored fly has five or six weeks before her, wherein to explore\r\nthe clay nests amid the thyme and to take her small share of the joys\r\nof life. In July, we shall see her once more, busy this time with the\r\nentrance into the cell, which is even stranger than the exit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. ANOTHER PROBER (PERFORATOR)\r\n\r\nWhat can he be called, this creature whose style and title I dare not\r\ninscribe at the head of the chapter? His name is Monodontomerus cupreus,\r\nSM. Just try it, for fun: Mo-no-don-to-me-rus. What a gorgeous mouthful!\r\nWhat an idea it gives one of some beast of the Apocalypse! We think,\r\nwhen we pronounce the word, of the prehistoric monsters: the mastodon,\r\nthe mammoth, the ponderous megatherium. Well, we are misled by the\r\nscientific label: we have to do with a very paltry insect, smaller than\r\nthe common gnat.\r\n\r\nThere are good people like that, only too happy to serve science with\r\nresounding appellations that might come from Timbuktu; they cannot name\r\nyou a midge without striking terror into you. O ye wise and revered\r\nones, ye christeners of animals, I am willing, in my study, to\r\nmake use--but not undue use--of your harsh terminology, with its\r\nconglomeration of syllables; but there is a danger of their leaving the\r\nsanctum and appearing before the public, which is always ready to show\r\nits lack of deference for terms that do not respect its ears. I, wishing\r\nto speak like everybody else, so that I may be understood by all, and\r\npersuaded that science has no need of this Brobdignagian jargon, make a\r\npoint of avoiding technical nomenclature when it becomes too barbarous,\r\nwhen it threatens to lumber the page the moment my pen attempts it. And\r\nso I abandon Monodontomerus.\r\n\r\nIt is a puny little insect, almost as tiny as the midges whom we see\r\neddying in a ray of sunshine at the end of autumn. Its dress is golden\r\nbronze; its eyes are coral red. It carries a naked sword, that is to\r\nsay, the sheath of its drill stands out slantwise at the tip of its\r\nbelly, instead of lying in a hollow groove along the back, as it\r\ndoes with the Leucospis. This scabbard holds the latter half of the\r\ninoculating filament, which extends below the animal to the base of\r\nthe abdomen. In short, its utensil is that of the Leucospis, with this\r\ndifference, that its lower half sticks out like a rapier.\r\n\r\nThis mite that bears a sword upon her rump is yet another persecutor of\r\nthe mason bees and not one of the least formidable. She exploits their\r\nnests at the same time as the Leucospis. I see her, like the Leucospis,\r\nslowly explore the ground with her antennae; I see her, like the\r\nLeucospis, bravely drive her dagger into the stone wall. More taken up\r\nwith her work, less conscious perhaps of danger, she pays no heed to the\r\nman who is observing her so closely. Where the Leucospis flies, she does\r\nnot budge. So great is her assurance that she comes right into my study,\r\nto my work table, and disputes my ownership of the nests whose occupants\r\nI am examining. She operates under my lens, she operates just beside\r\nmy forceps. What risk does she run? What can one do to a thing so very\r\nsmall? She is so certain of her safety that I can take the Mason's\r\nnest in my hand, move it, put it down and take it up again without\r\nthe insect's raising any objection: it continues its work even when my\r\nmagnifying glass is placed over it.\r\n\r\nOne of these heroines has come to inspect a nest of the Chalicodoma of\r\nthe Walls, most of whose cells are occupied by the numerous cocoons of\r\na parasite, the Stelis. The contents of these cells, which have been\r\npartially ripped up to satisfy my curiosity, are very much exposed to\r\nview. The windfall appears to be appreciated, for I see the dwarf ferret\r\nabout from cell to cell for four days on end, see her choose her cocoon\r\nand insert her awl in the most approved fashion. I thus learn that\r\nsight, although an indispensable guide in searching, does not decide\r\nupon the proper spot for the operation. Here is an insect exploring not\r\nthe stony exterior of the mason's dwelling, but the surface of cocoons\r\nwoven of silk. The explorer has never found herself placed in such\r\ncircumstances, nor has any of her race before her, every cocoon, under\r\nnormal conditions, being protected by a surrounding wall. No matter:\r\ndespite the profound difference in the surfaces, the insect does not\r\nwaver. Warned by a special sense, an undecipherable riddle to ourselves,\r\nit knows that the object of its search lies hidden under this unfamiliar\r\ncasing. The sense of smell has already been shown to be out of the\r\nquestion; that of sight is now eliminated in its turn.\r\n\r\nThat she should bore through the cocoons of the Stelis, a parasite of\r\nthe mason bee, does not surprise me at all: I know how indifferent my\r\nbold visitor is to the nature of the victuals destined for her family. I\r\nhave noticed her presence in the homes of bees differing greatly in\r\nsize and habits: Anthophorae, Osmiae, Chalicodomae, Anthidia. The Stelis\r\nexploited on my table is one victim more; and that is all. The interest\r\ndoes not lie there. The interest lies in the maneuvers of the insect,\r\nwhich I am able to follow under the most favorable conditions.\r\n\r\nBent sharply at right angles, like a couple of broken matches, the\r\nantennae feel the cocoon with their tips alone. The terminal joint is\r\nthe home of this strange sense which discerns from afar what no eye\r\nsees, no scent distinguishes and no ear hears. If the point explored be\r\nfound suitable, the insect hoists itself on tiptoe so as to give full\r\nscope to the play of its mechanism; it brings the tip of the belly\r\na little forward; and the entire ovipositor--inoculating-needle and\r\nscabbard--stands perpendicular to the cocoon, in the center of the\r\nquadrilateral described by the four hind legs, an eminently favorable\r\nposition for obtaining the maximum effect. For some time, the whole of\r\nthe awl bears on the cocoon, feeling all round with its point, groping\r\nabout; then, suddenly, the boring needle is released from its sheath,\r\nwhich falls back along the body, while the needle strives to make its\r\nentrance. The operation is a difficult one. I see the insect make a\r\nscore of attempts, one after the other, without succeeding in piercing\r\nthe tough wrapper of the Stelis. Should the instrument not penetrate,\r\nit retreats into its sheath and the insect resumes its scrutiny of the\r\ncocoon, sounding it point by point with the tips of its antennae. Then\r\nfurther thrusts are tried until one succeeds.\r\n\r\nThe eggs are little spindles, white and gleaming like ivory, about\r\ntwo-thirds of a millimeter in length. They have not the long, curved\r\npeduncle of the Leucospis' eggs; they are not suspended from the\r\nceiling of the cocoon like these, but are laid without order around\r\nthe fostering larva. Lastly, in a single cell and with a single mother,\r\nthere is always more than one laying; and the number of eggs varies\r\nconsiderably in each. The Leucospis, because of her great size, which\r\nrivals that of her victim, the Bee, finds in each cell provisions enough\r\nfor one and one alone. When, therefore, there is more than one set of\r\neggs in any one cell, this is due to a mistake on her part and not a\r\npremeditated result. Where the whole ration is required for the meals\r\nof a single grub, she would take good care not to install several if\r\nshe could help it. Her competitor is not called upon to observe the\r\nsame discretion. A Chalicodoma grub gives the dwarf the wherewithal to\r\nportion a score of her little ones, who will live in common and in all\r\ncomfort on what a single son of the giantess would eat up by himself.\r\nThe tiny boring engineer, therefore, always settles a numerous family\r\nat the same banquet. The bowl, ample for a dozen or two, is emptied in\r\nperfect harmony.\r\n\r\nCuriosity made me count the brood, to see if the mother was able to\r\nestimate the victuals and to proportion the number of guests to the\r\nsumptuousness of the fare provided. My notes mention fifty-four larvae\r\nin the cell of a masked Anthophora (Anthophora personata). No other\r\ncensus attained this figure. Possibly, two different mothers had laid\r\ntheir eggs in this crowded habitation. With the Mason bee of the Walls,\r\nI see the number of larvae vary, in different cells, between four\r\nand twenty-six; with the mason bee of the Sheds, between five and\r\nthirty-six; with the three-horned Osmia, who supplied me with the\r\nlargest number of records, between seven and twenty-five; with the\r\nblue Osmia (Osmia cyanea, KIRB.), between five and six; with the Stelis\r\n(Stelis nasuta), between four and twelve.\r\n\r\nThe first return and the last two seem to point to some relation between\r\nthe abundance of provisions and the number of consumers. When the mother\r\ncomes upon the bountiful larva of the masked Anthophora, she gives it\r\nhalf-a-hundred to feed; with the Stelis and the blue Osmia, niggardly\r\nrations both, she contents herself with half-a-dozen. To introduce into\r\nthe dining room only the number of boarders that the bill of fare will\r\nallow would certainly be a most deserving performance, especially as the\r\ninsect is placed under very difficult conditions to judge the contents\r\nof the cell. These contents, which lie hidden under the ceiling, are\r\ninvisible; and the insect can derive its information only from the\r\noutside of the nest, which varies in the different species. We\r\nshould therefore have to admit the existence of a particular power\r\nof discrimination, a sort of discernment of the species, which is\r\nrecognized as large or small from the outward aspect of its house. I\r\nrefuse to go to this length in my conjectures, not that instinct seems\r\nto me incapable of such feats, but because of the particulars obtained\r\nfrom the three-horned Osmia and the two mason bees.\r\n\r\nIn the cells of these three species, I see the number of larvae put out\r\nto nurse vary in so elastic a fashion that I must abandon all idea of\r\nproportionate adjustment. The mother, without troubling unduly whether\r\nthere be an excess or a dearth of provisions for her family, has filled\r\nthe cells as her fancy prompted, or rather according to the number of\r\nripe ovules contained in her ovaries at the time of the laying. If food\r\nbe over-plentiful, the brood will be all the better for it and will grow\r\nbigger and stronger; if food be scarce, the famished youngsters will not\r\ndie, but will remain smaller. Indeed, with both the larva and the full\r\ngrown insect, I have often observed a difference in size which varies\r\naccording to the density of the population, the members of a small\r\ncolony being double the size of their overcrowded neighbors.\r\n\r\nThe grubs are white, tapering at both ends, sharply segmented and\r\ncovered all over their bodies with a coat of fine, soft hairs which is\r\ninvisible except under the lens. The head consists of a little knob much\r\nsmaller in diameter than the body. In this head, the microscope reveals\r\nmandibles consisting of fine spikes of a tawny red, which spread into a\r\nwide, colorless base. Deprived of any indentation, incapable of chewing\r\nanything between their awl-shaped ends, these two tools serve at best to\r\nfix the grub slightly at some point of the fostering larva. Useless for\r\ncarving, therefore, the mouth is a pure osculatory sucker, which drains\r\nthe provisions by a process of exudation through the skin. We see here\r\nrepeated what the Anthrax and the Leucospis have already shown us:\r\nthe gradual exhaustion of a victim which the parasite consumes without\r\nkilling it.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious spectacle even after that of the Anthrax. We have here\r\ntwenty or thirty starvelings, all with their mouths pressed, as for a\r\nkiss, to the body of the plump larva, which, from day to day, fades and\r\nshrinks without the least appreciable wound, thus keeping fresh until\r\nreduced to a shriveled slough. If I disturb the gluttonous swarm, all,\r\nwith a sudden recoil, let go, drop off and flounder around the foster\r\nmother. They are no less prompt in resuming their savage kisses. I need\r\nnot add that neither at the point where they leave off nor at the point\r\nwhere they recommence is there the faintest trace of liquid. The oily\r\nexudation occurs only when the pump is at work. To linger over this\r\nstrange method of feeding is superfluous after what I have said about\r\nthe Anthrax.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the full grown insect takes place at the beginning of\r\nsummer, after nearly a whole year's stay in the invaded dwelling. The\r\nlarge number of inhabitants of one and the same cell led me to think\r\nthat the work of deliverance ought to present a certain interest. They\r\nare all equally anxious to clear the walls of the prison at the earliest\r\npossible moment and to come forth into the great festival of the sun: do\r\nthey all at the same time, in a confused horde, attack the ceiling which\r\nhas to be pierced? Is the work of deliverance arranged in the general\r\ninterest? Or is individual selfishness the only rule? These are the\r\nquestions which observation will answer.\r\n\r\nA little in advance of the proper season, I transfer each family into\r\na short glass tube, which will represent the natal cell. A good, thick\r\ncork, quite a centimeter deep, is the obstacle to be pierced for\r\nan outlet. Well, instead of the mad haste and the ruinous lack of\r\norganization which I expected to find, my broods show me in their glass\r\nprison an exceedingly well regulated workshop. One insect, one only,\r\nworks at perforating the cork. Patiently, with its mandibles, grain by\r\ngrain, it digs a tunnel the width of its body. The gallery is so narrow\r\nthat, in order to return to the tube, the worker has to move backwards.\r\nIt is a slow process; and it takes hours and hours to dig the hole, a\r\nhard job for the frail miner.\r\n\r\nShould her fatigue become too great, the excavator leaves the forefront\r\nand mingles with the crowd, to polish and dust herself. Another, the\r\nfirst neighbor at hand, at once takes her place and is herself relieved\r\nby a third when her task is done. Others again take their turn, always\r\none at a time, so much so that the works are never at a standstill\r\nand never overcrowded. Meanwhile, the multitude keeps out of the way,\r\nquietly and patiently. There is no anxiety as to the deliverance.\r\nSuccess will come: of that they are all convinced. While waiting, one\r\nwashes her antennae by passing them through her mouth, another polishes\r\nher wings with her hind legs, another frisks about to while away the\r\nperiod of inaction. Some are making love, a sovran means of killing\r\ntime, whether one be born that day or twenty years ago.\r\n\r\nSome, I said, make love. These favored ones are rare; they hardly count.\r\nIs it through indifference? No, but the gallants are lacking. The sexes\r\nare very unequally represented in the population of a cell: the males\r\nare in a wretched minority and sometimes even completely absent. This\r\npoverty did not escape the older observers. Brulle [Gaspard August\r\nBrulle (1809-1873)], the author of many works on natural history and one\r\nof the founders of the Societe entomologique de France, the only author\r\nwhom I am able to consult in my hermitage, says, literally: 'The males\r\ndo not appear to be known.'\r\n\r\nI, for my part, know them; but, considering their feeble number, I keep\r\nasking myself what part they play in a harem so disproportionate to\r\ntheir forces. A few figures will show us what my hesitations are based\r\nupon.\r\n\r\nIn twenty-two Osmia cocoons (Osmia tricornis), the total census of the\r\ninmates yields three hundred and fifty-four, of whom forty-seven\r\nare males and three hundred and seven females. The average number of\r\ninmates, therefore, is sixteen individuals; and there are six females at\r\nleast to one male. This disparity is maintained, in more or less marked\r\nproportions, whatever the species of the bee invaded. In the cocoons of\r\nthe Mason bee of the Sheds, I discover the average proportion to be six\r\nfemales to one male; in those of the Mason bee of the Walls, I find one\r\nmale to fifteen females.\r\n\r\nThese facts, which I am unable to state with any greater precision, are\r\nenough to give rise to the suspicion that the males, who are even tinier\r\ndwarfs than the females and who, moreover, like all insects, are injured\r\nby a single act of pairing, must, in most cases, remain strangers to\r\nthe females. Can the mothers, in fact, dispense with their assistance,\r\nwithout being deprived of offspring on that account? I do not say yes,\r\nbut I do not say no. The duality of the sexes is a hard problem. Why\r\ntwo sexes? Why not just one? It would have been much simpler and saved\r\na great deal of foolery. Why such a thing as sex, when the tuber of the\r\nJerusalem artichoke can do without it? These are the pregnant questions\r\nsuggested to me, in the end, by Monodontomerus cupreus, the insect so\r\ninfinitesimal in body and so overpowering in name that I had really\r\nvowed never to speak of it again by its official designation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. LARVAL DIMORPHISM\r\n\r\nIf the reader has paid any attention to the story of the Anthrax, he\r\nmust have perceived that my narrative is incomplete. The fox in the\r\nfable saw how the lion's visitors entered his den, but did not see how\r\nthey went out. With us, it is the converse: we know the way out of the\r\nmason bee's fortress, but we do not know the way in. To leave the cell\r\nof which he has eaten the owner, the Anthrax becomes a perforating\r\nmachine, a living tool from which our own industry might take a hint if\r\nit required new drills for boring rocks. When the exit tunnel is opened,\r\nthis tool splits like a pod bursting in the sun; and from the stout\r\nframework there escapes a dainty fly, a velvety flake, a soft fluff that\r\nastounds us by its contrast with the roughness of the depths whence it\r\nascends. On this point, we know pretty well what there is to know. There\r\nremains the entrance into the cell, a puzzle that has kept me on the\r\nalert for a quarter of a century.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, it is evident that the mother cannot lodge her egg in the\r\ncell of the mason bee, which has been long closed and barricaded with\r\na cement wall by the time that the Anthrax makes her appearance. To\r\npenetrate it, she would have to become an excavating tool once more and\r\nresume the cast-off rags which she left behind in the exit window; she\r\nwould have to retrace her steps, to be reborn a pupa; and life knows\r\nnone of these retrogressions. The full grown insect, if endowed with\r\nclaws, mandibles and plenty of perseverance, might at a pinch force the\r\nmortar casket; but the fly is not so endowed. Her slender legs would be\r\nstrained and deformed by merely sweeping away a little dust; her mouth\r\nis a sucker for gathering the sugary exudations of the flowers and not\r\nthe solid pincers needed for the crumbling of cement. There is no auger\r\neither, no bore copied from that of the Leucospis, no implement of any\r\nkind that can work its way into the thickness of the wall and dispatch\r\nthe egg to its destination. In short, the mother is absolutely incapable\r\nof settling her eggs in the chamber of the Mason bee.\r\n\r\nCan it be the grub that makes its own way into the storeroom, that same\r\ngrub which we have seen draining the Chalicodoma with its leech-like\r\nkisses? Let us call the creature to mind: a little oily sausage, which\r\nstretches and curls up just where it lies, without being able to shift\r\nits position. Its body is a smooth cylinder; its mouth simply a\r\ncircular lip. Not one ambulatory organ does it possess; not even hairs,\r\nprotuberances or wrinkles to enable it to crawl. The animal is made\r\nfor digestion and immobility. Its organization is incompatible with\r\nmovement; everything tells us so in the clearest fashion. No, this\r\ngrub is even less able than the mother to make its way unaided into the\r\nmason's dwelling. And yet the provisions are there; those provisions\r\nmust be reached: it is a matter of life or death; to be or not to be.\r\nThen how does the fly set about it? It would be vain for me to question\r\nprobabilities, too often illusory; to obtain a reply of any value, I\r\nhave but one resource; I must attempt the nearly impossible and watch\r\nthe Anthrax from the egg onwards.\r\n\r\nAlthough Anthrax flies are fairly common, in the sense of there being\r\nseveral different species, they are not plentiful when it is a case of\r\nwanting a colony populous enough to admit of continuous observation.\r\nI see them, now here, now there, in the fiercely sun-scorched places,\r\nflitting hither and thither on the old walls, the slopes and the sand,\r\nsometimes in small platoons, most often singly. I can expect nothing\r\nof those vagabonds, who are here today and gone tomorrow, for I know\r\nnothing of their settlements. To keep a watch on them, one by one,\r\nin the blazing heat, is very painful and very unfruitful, as the\r\nswift-winged insect has a habit of disappearing one knows not whither\r\njust when a prospect of capturing its secret begins to offer. I have\r\nwasted many a patient hour at this pursuit, without the least result.\r\n\r\nThere might be some chance of success with Anthrax flies whose home was\r\nknown to us beforehand, especially if insects of the same species\r\nformed a pretty numerous colony. The inquiries begun with one would\r\nbe continued with a second and with more, until a complete verdict was\r\nforthcoming. Now, in the course of my long entomological career, I have\r\nmet with but two species of Anthrax that fulfilled this condition and\r\nwere to be found regularly: one at Carpentras; the other at Serignan.\r\nThe first, Anthrax sinuata, FALLEN, lives in the cocoons of Osmia\r\ntricornis, who herself builds her nest in the old galleries of the\r\nhairy-footed Anthophora; the second, Anthrax trifasciata, MEIGEN,\r\nexploits the Chalicodoma of the Sheds. I will consult both.\r\n\r\nOnce more, here am I, somewhat late in life, at Carpentras, whose rude\r\nGallic name sets the fool smiling and the scholar thinking. Dear little\r\ntown where I spent my twentieth year and left the first bits of my\r\nfleece upon life's bushes, my visit of today is a pilgrimage; I have\r\ncome to lay my eyes once more upon the place which saw the birth of the\r\nliveliest impressions of my early days. I bow, in passing, to the old\r\ncollege where I tried my prentice hand as a teacher. Its appearance is\r\nunchanged; it still looks like a penitentiary. Those were the views of\r\nour mediaeval educational system. To the gaiety and activity of boyhood,\r\nwhich were considered unwholesome, it applied the remedy of narrowness,\r\nmelancholy and gloom. Its houses of instruction were, above all, houses\r\nof correction. The freshness of Virgil was interpreted in the stifling\r\natmosphere of a prison. I catch a glimpse of a yard between four high\r\nwalls, a sort of bear pit, where the scholars fought for room for their\r\ngames under the spreading branches of a plane tree. All around were\r\ncells that looked like horse boxes, without light or air; those were the\r\nclassrooms. I speak in the past tense, for doubtless the present day has\r\nseen the last of this academic destitution.\r\n\r\nHere is the tobacco shop where, on Wednesday evening, coming out of the\r\ncollege, I would buy on credit the wherewithal to fill my pipe and thus\r\nto celebrate on the eve the joys of the morrow, that blessed Thursday\r\n[the weekly half-holiday in French schools] which I considered so well\r\nemployed in solving hard equations, experimenting with new chemical\r\nreagents, collecting and identifying my plants. I would make my timid\r\nrequest, pretending to have come out without my money, for it is hard\r\nfor a self-respecting man to admit that he is penniless. My candor\r\nappears to have inspired some little confidence; and I obtained credit,\r\nan unprecedented thing, with the representative of the revenue. [The\r\ngovernment in France has the sole control of the tobacco trade, which\r\nforms an important branch of the inland revenue.] Ah, why did not I open\r\na shop and expose for sale some packets of candles, a dozen dried cod,\r\na barrel of sardines and a few cakes of soap! I am no more of a fool nor\r\nany less industrious than another; and I should have made my way. But,\r\nas it was, what could I expect? As an accoucheur of brains, a molder of\r\nintellects, I had no claim even to bread and cheese.\r\n\r\nHere is my former habitation, occupied since by droning monks. In the\r\nembrasure of that window, sheltered from profane hands, between the\r\nclosed outer shutters and the panes, I used to keep my chemicals, bought\r\nfor a few sous cheated out of the weekly budget in the early days of our\r\nhousekeeping. The bowl of a pipe was my crucible, a sweet jar my retort,\r\nmustard pots my receptacles for oxides and sulfides. My experiments,\r\nharmless or dangerous, were made on a corner of the fire beside the\r\nsimmering broth.\r\n\r\nHow I should love to see that room again where I pored over\r\ndifferentials and integrals, where I calmed my poor burning head\r\nby gazing at Mont Ventoux, whose summit held in store for my coming\r\nexpedition' those denizens of arctic climes, the saxifrage and the\r\npoppy! And to see my familiar friend, the blackboard which I hired at\r\nfive francs a year from a crusty joiner, that board whose value I paid\r\nmany times over, though I. could never buy it outright, for want of the\r\nnecessary cash! The conic sections which I described on that blackboard,\r\nthe learned hieroglyphics!\r\n\r\nThough all my efforts, which were the more deserving because I had to\r\nwork alone, led to almost nothing in that congenial calling, I would\r\nbegin it all over again if I could. I should love to be conversing for\r\nthe first time with Leibnitz and Newton, with Laplace and Lagrange, with\r\nCuvier and Jussieu, even if I had afterwards to solve that other arduous\r\nproblem: how to procure one's daily bread. Ah, young men, my successors,\r\nwhat an easy time you have of it today! If you don't know it, then let\r\nme tell you so by means of these few pages from the life of one of your\r\nelders.\r\n\r\nBut let us not forget our insects, while listening to the echoes of\r\nillusions and difficulties roused in my memories by the cupboard window\r\nand the hired blackboard. Let us go back to the sunken roads of the\r\nLegue, which have become classic, so they say, since the appearance of\r\nmy notes on the Oil beetles. Ye illustrious ravines, with your sun-baked\r\nslopes, if I have contributed a little to your fame, you, in your turn,\r\nhave given me many fair hours of forgetfulness in the happiness of\r\nlearning. You, at least, did not lure me with vain hopes; all that you\r\npromised you gave me and often a hundredfold. You are my promised land,\r\nwhere I would have sought at the last to pitch my observer's tent. My\r\nwish was not to be realized. Let me, at least, in passing, greet my\r\nbeloved animals of the old days.\r\n\r\nI raise my hat to Cerceris tuberculata, whom I see engaged on that\r\nslant, storing her Cleonus [a large species of weevil]. As I saw her\r\nthen, so I see her now: the same staggering attempts to hoist the prey\r\nto the mouth of the burrow; the same brawls between males watching in\r\nthe brushwood of the kermes oak. The sight of them sends a younger blood\r\ncoursing through my veins; I receive as it were the breath of a new\r\nspringtime of life. Time presses; let us pass on.\r\n\r\nAnother bow on this side. I hear buzzing up above, on that ledge, a\r\ncolony of Sphex wasps, stabbing their crickets. We will give them a\r\nfriendly glance, but no more. My acquaintances here are too numerous;\r\nI have not the leisure to renew my former relations with all of them.\r\nWithout stopping, a wave of the hat to the Philanthi [bee-hunting wasps]\r\nwho send the long avalanches of rubbish streaming down from their\r\nnests; and to Stizus ruficornis, [a hunting wasp] who stacks her praying\r\nmantises between two flakes of sandstone; and to the silky Ammophila\r\n[a digger wasp] with the red legs, who collects an underground store of\r\nloopers [also known as measuring worms, the larvae or caterpillars of\r\nthe geometrid moth] and to the Tachtyti [hunting wasps], devourers of\r\nlocusts; and to the Eumenes, builders of clay cupolas on a bough.\r\n\r\nHere we are at last. This high, perpendicular rock, facing the south\r\nto a length of some hundreds of yards and riddled with holes like a\r\nmonstrous sponge, is the time-honored dwelling place of the hairy-footed\r\nAnthophora and of her rent free tenant, the three-horned Osmia. Here\r\nalso swarm their exterminators: the Sitaris beetle, the parasite of the\r\nAnthophora; the Anthrax fly, the murderer of the Osmia. Ill informed as\r\nto the proper period, I have come rather late, on the 10th of September.\r\nI should have been here a month ago, or even by the end of July, to\r\nwatch the fly's operations. My journey threatens to be fruitless: I see\r\nbut a few rare Anthrax flies, hovering round the face of the cliff. We\r\nwill not despair, however, and we will begin by consulting the locality.\r\n\r\nThe Anthophora's cells contain this bee in the larval stage. Some of\r\nthem provide me with the oil beetle and the Sitaris, rare finds at one\r\ntime, today of no use to me. Others contain the Melecta [a parasitic\r\nbee] in the form of a highly colored pupa, or even in that of the full\r\ngrown insect. The Osmia, still more precocious, though dating from the\r\nsame period, shows herself exclusively in the adult form, a bad omen for\r\nmy investigations, for what the Anthrax demands is the larva and not the\r\nperfect insect. The fly's grub doubles my apprehensions. Its development\r\nis complete, the larva on which it feeds is consumed, perhaps several\r\nweeks ago. I no longer doubt but that I have come too late to see what\r\nhappens in the Osmia's cocoons.\r\n\r\nIs the game lost? Not yet. My notes contain evidence of Anthrax flies\r\nhatching in the latter half of September. Besides, those whom I now see\r\nexploring the rock are not there to take exercise: their preoccupation\r\nis the settling of the family. These belated ones cannot tackle the\r\nOsmia, who, with her firm, adult flesh, would not suit the nursling's\r\ndelicate needs and who, moreover, powerful as she is, would offer\r\nresistance. But in autumn a less numerous colony of honey gatherers\r\ntakes the place, upon the slope, of the spring colony, from which\r\nit differs in species. In particular, I see the Diadem Anthidium [a\r\nclothier bee who lines her nest with wool and cotton] at work, entering\r\nher galleries at one time with her harvest of pollen dust and at\r\nanother with her little bale of cotton. Might not these autumnal Bees be\r\nthemselves exploited by the Anthrax, the same that selected the Osmia as\r\nher victim a couple of months earlier? This would explain the presence\r\nof the Anthrax flies whom I now see fussing about.\r\n\r\nA little reassured by this conjecture, I take my stand at the foot\r\nof the rock, under a broiling sun; and, for half a day, I follow the\r\nevolutions of my flies. They flit quietly in front of the slope, at a\r\nfew inches from the earthy covering. They go from one orifice to the\r\nnext, but without even penetrating. For that matter, their big wings,\r\nextended crosswise even when at rest, would resist their entrance into a\r\ngallery, which is too narrow to admit those spreading sails. And so they\r\nexplore the cliff, going to and fro and up and down, with a flight that\r\nis now sudden, now smooth and slow. From time to time, I see the Anthrax\r\nquickly approach the wall and lower her abdomen as though to touch the\r\nearth with the end of her ovipositor. This proceeding takes no longer\r\nthan the twinkling of an eye. When it is done, the insect alights\r\nelsewhere and rests. Then it resumes its sober flight, its long\r\ninvestigations and its sudden blows with the tip of its belly against\r\nthe layer of earth. The Bombylii [bee flies] observe similar tactics\r\nwhen soaring at a short height above the ground.\r\n\r\nI at once rushed to the spot touched, lens in hand, in the hope of\r\nfinding the egg which everything told me was laid during that tap of the\r\nabdomen. I could distinguish nothing, in spite of the closest attention.\r\nIt is true that my exhaustion, together with the blinding light and\r\nscorching heat, made examination very difficult. Afterwards, when I made\r\nthe acquaintance of the tiny thing that issues from that egg, my failure\r\nno longer surprised me. In the leisure of my study, with my eyes rested\r\nand with my most powerful glasses held in a hand no longer shaking with\r\nexcitement and fatigue, I have the very greatest difficulty in finding\r\nthe infinitesimal creature, though I know exactly where it lies. Then\r\nhow could I see the egg, worn out as I was under the sun-baked cliff,\r\nhow discover the precise spot of a laying performed in a moment by an\r\ninsect seen only at a distance? In the painful conditions wherein I\r\nfound myself, failure was inevitable.\r\n\r\nDespite my negative attempts, therefore, I remain convinced that the\r\nAnthrax flies strew their eggs one by one, on the spots frequented by\r\nthose bees who suit their grubs. Each of their sudden strokes with the\r\ntip of the abdomen represents a laying. They take no precaution to place\r\nthe germ under cover; for that matter, any such precaution would be\r\nrendered impossible by the mother's structure. The egg, that delicate\r\nobject, is laid roughly in the blazing sun, between grains of sand,\r\nin some wrinkle of the calcined chalk. That summary installation is\r\nsufficient, provided the coveted larva be near at hand. It is for the\r\nyoung grub now to manage as best it can at its own risk and peril.\r\n\r\nThough the sunken roads of the Legue did not tell me all that I wished\r\nto know, they at least made it very probable that the coming grub must\r\nreach the victualled cell by its own efforts. But the grub which we\r\nknow, the one that drains the bag of fat which may be a Chalicodoma\r\nlarva or an Osmia larva, cannot move from its place, still less indulge\r\nin journeys of discovery through the thickness of a wall and the web\r\nof a cocoon. So an imperative necessity presents itself: there must\r\nperforce be an initial larva form, capable of moving and organized for\r\nsearching, a form under which the grub would attain its end. The\r\nAnthrax would thus possess two larval states: one to penetrate to the\r\nprovisions; the other to consume them. I allow myself to be convinced\r\nby the logic of it all; I already see in my mind's eye the wee animal\r\ncoming out of the egg, endowed with sufficient power of motion not to\r\ndread a walk and with sufficient slenderness to glide into the smallest\r\ncrevices. Once in the presence of the larva on which it is to feed, it\r\ndoffs its travelling dress and becomes the obese animal whose one duty\r\nit is to grow big and fat in immobility. This is all very coherent;\r\nit is all deduced like a geometrical proposition. But to the wings of\r\nimagination, however smooth their flight, we must prefer the sandals\r\nof observed facts, the slow sandals with the leaden soles. Thus shod, I\r\nproceed.\r\n\r\nNext year, I resume my investigations, this time on the Anthrax of the\r\nChalicodoma, who is my neighbor in the surrounding wastelands and will\r\nallow me to repeat my visits daily, morning and evening if need be.\r\nTaught by my earlier studies, I now know the exact period of the Bee's\r\nhatching and therefore of the Anthrax' laying, which must take place\r\nsoon after. Anthrax trifasciata settles her family in July, or in August\r\nat latest. Every morning, at nine o'clock, when the heat begins to\r\nbe unendurable and when, to use [the author's gardener and factotum]\r\nFavier's expression, an extra log is flung on the bonfire of the sun,\r\nI take the field, prepared to come back with my head aching from the\r\nglare, provided that I bring home the solution of my puzzle. A man must\r\nhave the devil in him to leave the shade at this time of the year. And\r\nwhat for, pray? To write the story of a fly! The greater the heat, the\r\nbetter my chance of success. What causes me to suffer torture fills the\r\ninsect with delight; what prostrates me braces the fly. Come along!\r\n\r\nThe road shimmers like a sheet of molten steel. From the dusty and\r\nmelancholy olive trees rises a mighty, throbbing hum, a great andante\r\nwhose executants have the whole sweep of woods for their orchestra. 'Tis\r\nthe concert of the Cicada, whose bellies sway and rustle with increasing\r\nfrenzy as the temperature rises. The strident scrapings of the Cicada of\r\nthe Ash, the Carcan of the district, lend their rhythm to the one note\r\nsymphony of the common cicada. This is the moment: come along! And, for\r\nfive or six weeks, oftenest in the morning, sometimes in the afternoon,\r\nI set myself to explore the flinty plateau.\r\n\r\nThe Chalicodoma's nests abound, but I cannot see a single Anthrax make\r\na black speck upon their surface. Not one, busy with her laying, settles\r\nin front of me. At most, from time to time, I can just see one passing\r\nfar away, with an impetuous rush. I lose her in the distance; and that\r\nis all. It is impossible to be present at the laying of the egg. I know\r\nthe little that I learnt from the cliffs in the Legue and nothing more.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I recognize the difficulty, I hasten to enlist assistants.\r\nShepherds--mere small boys--keep the sheep in these stony meadows,\r\nwhere the flocks graze, to the greater glory of our local mutton, on the\r\ncamphor saturated badafo, that is to say, spike lavender. I explain as\r\nwell as I can the object of my search; I talk to them of a big black Fly\r\nand the nests on which she ought to settle, the clay nests so well\r\nknown to those who have learnt how to extract the honey with a straw in\r\nspringtime and spread it on a crust of bread. They are to watch that fly\r\nand take good note of the nests on which they may see her alight; and,\r\non the same evening, when they bring their flocks back to the village,\r\nthey are to tell me the result of their day's work. On receiving\r\ntheir favorable report, I will go with them, next day, to continue the\r\nobservations. They shall be paid for their trouble, of course. These\r\nlatter day Corydons have not the manners of antiquity: they reck little\r\nof the seven holed flute cemented with wax, or of the beechen bowl,\r\npreferring the coppers that will take them to the village inn on Sunday.\r\nA reward in ready money is promised for each nest that fulfils the\r\ndesired conditions; and the bargain is enthusiastically accepted.\r\n\r\nThere are three of them; and I make a fourth. Shall we manage it, among\r\nus all? I thought so. By the end of August, however, my last illusions\r\nwere dispelled. Not one of us had succeeded in seeing the big black Fly\r\nperching on the dome of the mason bee.\r\n\r\nOur failure, it seems to me, can be explained thus: outside the spacious\r\nfront of the Anthophora's settlement, the Anthrax is in permanent\r\nresidence. She visits, on the wing, every nook and corner, without\r\nmoving away from the native cliff, because it would be useless to go\r\nfarther. There is board and lodging here, indefinitely, for all her\r\nfamily. When some spot is deemed favorable, she hovers round inspecting\r\nit, then comes up suddenly and strikes it with the tip of her abdomen.\r\nThe thing is done, the egg is laid. So I picture it, at least. Within a\r\nradius of a few yards and in a flight broken by short intervals of rest\r\nin the sun, she carries on her search of likely places for the laying\r\nand dissemination of her eggs. The insect's assiduous attendance upon\r\nthe same slope is caused by the inexhaustible wealth of the locality\r\nexploited.\r\n\r\nThe Anthrax of the Chalicodoma labors under very different conditions.\r\nStay-at-home habits would be detrimental to her. With her rushing\r\nflight, made easy by the long and powerful spread of her wings, she must\r\ntravel far and wide if she would found a colony. The bee's nests are not\r\ndiscovered in groups, but occur singly on their pebbles, scattered more\r\nor less everywhere over acres of ground. To find a single one is not\r\nenough for the fly: on account of the many parasites, not all the cells,\r\nby a long way, contain the desired larva; others, too well protected,\r\nwould not allow of access to the provisions. Very many nests are\r\nnecessary, perhaps, for the eggs of one alone; and the finding of them\r\ncalls for long journeys.\r\n\r\nI therefore picture the Anthrax coming and going in every direction\r\nacross the stony plain. Her practiced eye requires no slackened flight\r\nto distinguish the earthen dome which she is seeking. Having found it,\r\nshe inspects it from above, still on the wing; she taps it once and\r\nyet once again with the tip of her ovipositor and forthwith makes off,\r\nwithout having set foot on the ground. Should she take a rest, it will\r\nbe elsewhere, no matter where, on the soil, on a stone, on a tuft\r\nof lavender or thyme. Given these habits--and my observations in the\r\nCarpentras roads make them seem exceedingly probable--it is small wonder\r\nthat the perspicacity of my young shepherds and myself should have come\r\nto naught. I was expecting the impossible: the Anthrax does not halt on\r\nthe mason bee's nest to proceed with her laying in a methodical fashion;\r\nshe merely pays a flying visit.\r\n\r\nAnd so I develop my theory of a primary larval form, differing in every\r\nway from the one which I know. The organization of the Anthrax must be\r\nsuch, at the beginning, as to permit of its moving on the surface of the\r\ndome where the egg has been dropped so carelessly; the nascent grub must\r\nbe supplied with tools to pierce the concrete wall and enter the Bee's\r\ncell through some cranny. The fly grub, perhaps dragging the remnants of\r\nthe egg behind it, must set out in quest of board and lodging almost as\r\nsoon as it is born. It will succeed under the guidance of instinct, that\r\nfaculty which waits not to number the days and which is as far seeing at\r\nthe moment of hatching as after the trials of a busy life. This primary\r\ngrub does not seem to me outside the limits of possibility; I see it, if\r\nnot in the body, at least in its actions, as plainly as though it were\r\nreally under the lens. It exists, if reason be not a vain and empty\r\nguide; I must find it; I shall find it. Never in the history of my\r\ninvestigations has the logic of things been more insistent; never has\r\nit directed me with greater certainty towards a magnificent biological\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nWhile vainly trying to witness the laying of the eggs, I inquire, at the\r\nsame time, into the contents of the Mason bee's nests, in quest of\r\nthe grub just issued from the egg. My own harvest and that of my young\r\nshepherds, whose zeal I employ in a task less difficult than the first,\r\nprocure me heaps of nests, enough to fill baskets and baskets. These are\r\nall inspected at leisure, on my work table, with the excitement which\r\nthe certainty of an approaching fine discovery never fails to give. The\r\nMason's cocoons are taken from the cells, inspected without, opened and\r\ninspected within. My lens explores their innermost recesses; speck by\r\nspeck, it explores the Chalicodoma's slumbering larva; it explores the\r\ninner walls of the cells. Nothing, nothing, nothing! For a fortnight\r\nand more, nests were rejected and heaped up in a corner; my study was\r\ncrammed with them. What hecatombs of unfortunate sleepers removed from\r\ntheir silken bags and doomed, for the most part, to a wretched end,\r\ndespite the care which I took to put them in a place of safety, where\r\nthe work of the transformation might be pursued! Curiosity makes us\r\ncruel. I continue to rip up cocoons. And nothing, nothing! It needed the\r\nsturdiest faith to make me persevere. That faith I possessed; and well\r\nfor me that I did.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of July--the date deserves to be recorded--I saw, or rather\r\nseemed to see, something move on the Chalicodoma's larva. Was it an\r\nillusion born of my hopes? Was it a bit of diaphanous down stirred by my\r\nbreath? It was not an illusion, it was not a bit of down, it was really\r\nand truly a grub. What a moment, followed by what perplexities! The\r\nthing has nothing in common with the larva of the Anthrax, it suggests\r\nrather some microscopic Thread worm that, by accident, has made its way\r\nthrough the skin of its host and come to enjoy itself outside. I do not\r\nreckon my discovery as of much value, because I am so greatly puzzled\r\nby the creature's appearance. No matter: we will take a small glass\r\ntube and place inside it the Chalicodoma grub and the mysterious thing\r\nwriggling on the surface. Suppose it should be what I am looking for?\r\nWho knows?\r\n\r\nOnce warned of the probable difficulty of seeing the animalcule for\r\nwhich I am hunting, I redouble my attention, so much so that, in a\r\ncouple of days, I am the owner of half a score of tiny worms similar\r\nto the one which caused me such excitement. Each of them is lodged in\r\na glass tube with its Chalicodoma grub. The infinitesimal thing is so\r\nsmall, so diaphanous, blends to such good purpose with its host that the\r\nleast fold of skin conceals it from my view. After watching it one day\r\nthrough the lens, I sometimes fail to find it again on the morrow. I\r\nthink that I have lost it, that it has perished under the weight of the\r\noverturned larva and returned to that nothing to which it was so closely\r\nakin. Then it moves and I see it again. For a whole fortnight, there\r\nwas no limit to my perplexity. Was it really the original larva of the\r\nAnthrax? Yes, for I at last saw my bantlings transform themselves into\r\nthe larva previously described and make their first start at draining\r\ntheir victims with kisses. A few moments of satisfaction like those\r\nwhich I then enjoyed make up for many a weary hour.\r\n\r\nLet us resume the story of the wee animal, now recognized as the genuine\r\norigin of the Anthrax. It is a tiny worm about a millimeter long and\r\nalmost as slender as a hair. It is very difficult to see because of its\r\ntransparency. When tucked away in a fold of the skin of its fostering\r\nlarva, an excessively fine skin, it remains undiscoverable to the lens.\r\nBut the feeble creature is very active: it tramps over the sides of the\r\nrich morsel, walks all round it. It covers the ground pretty quickly,\r\nbuckling and unbuckling by turns, very much after the manner of the\r\nlooper caterpillar. Its two extremities are its chief points of support.\r\nWhen at a standstill, it moves its front half in every direction, as\r\nthough to explore the space around it; when walking, it swells out,\r\nmagnifies its segments and then looks like a bit of knotted string.\r\n\r\nThe microscope shows us thirteen rings, including the head. This head is\r\nsmall, slightly horny, as is proved by its amber color, and bristles in\r\nfront with a small number of short, stiff hairs. On each of the three\r\nsegments of the thorax there are two long hairs, fixed to the lower\r\nsurface; and there are two similar and still longer hairs at the end of\r\nthe terminal ring. These four pairs of bristles, three in front and one\r\nbehind, are the locomotory organs, to which we must add the hairy edge\r\nof the head and also the anal button, a sustaining base which might\r\nvery well work with the aid of a certain stickiness, as happens with\r\nthe primary larva of the Sitaris [a Parasitic Beetle noted for the\r\nmultiplicity of transformations undergone by the grub]. We see, through\r\nthe transparent skin, two long air tubes running parallel to each other\r\nfrom the first thoracic segment to the last abdominal segment but one.\r\nThey ought to end in two pairs of breathing holes which I have not\r\nsucceeded in distinguishing quite plainly. Those two big respiratory\r\nvessels are characteristic of the grubs of flies. Their mouths\r\ncorrespond exactly with the points at which the two sets of stigmata\r\nopen in the Anthrax larva in its second form.\r\n\r\nFor a fortnight, the feeble grub remains in the condition which I have\r\ndescribed, without growing and very probably also without nourishment.\r\nAssiduous though my visits be, I never perceive it taking any\r\nrefreshment. Besides, what would it eat? In the cocoon invaded there is\r\nnothing but the larva of the mason bee; and the worm cannot make use\r\nof this before acquiring the sucker that comes with the second form.\r\nNevertheless, this life of abstinence is not a life of idleness. The\r\nanimalcule explores its dish, now here, now elsewhere; it runs all over\r\nit with looper strides; it pries into the neighborhood by lifting and\r\nshaking its head.\r\n\r\nI see a need for this long wait under a transitory form that requires\r\nno feeding. The egg is laid by the mother on the surface of the nest,\r\nsomewhere near a suitable cell, I dare say, but still at a distance from\r\nthe fostering larva, which is protected by a thick rampart. It is for\r\nthe new born grub to make its own way to the provisions, not by violence\r\nand house breaking, of which it is incapable, but by patiently slipping\r\nthrough a maze of cracks, first tried, then abandoned, then tried again.\r\nIt is a very difficult task, even for this most slender worm, for the\r\nbee's masonry is exceedingly compact. There are no chinks due to bad\r\nbuilding; no fissures due to the weather; nothing but an apparently\r\nimpenetrable homogeneity. I see but one weak part and that only in a few\r\nnests: it is the line where the dome joins the surface of the stone. An\r\nimperfect soldering between two materials of different nature, cement\r\nand flint, may leave a breach wide enough to admit besiegers as thin as\r\na hair. Nevertheless, the lens is far from always finding an inlet of\r\nthis kind on the nests occupied by Anthrax flies.\r\n\r\nAnd so I am ready to allow that the animalcule wandering in search of\r\nits cell has the whole area of the dome at its disposal when selecting\r\nan entrance. Where the line auger of the Leucospis can enter, is there\r\nnot room enough for the even slimmer Anthrax grub? True, the Leucospis\r\npossesses muscular force and a hard boring tool. The Anthrax is\r\nextremely weak and has nothing but invincible patience. It does at\r\ngreat length of time what the other, furnished with superior implements,\r\naccomplishes in three hours. This explains the fortnight spent by the\r\nAnthrax under the initial form, the object of which is to overcome\r\nthe obstacle of the mason's wall, to pierce through the texture of the\r\ncocoon and to reach the victuals.\r\n\r\nI even believe that it takes longer. The work is so laborious and\r\nthe worker so feeble! I cannot tell how long it is since my bantlings\r\nattained their object. Perhaps, aided by easy roads, they had reached\r\ntheir fostering larvae long before the completion of their first\r\nbabyhood, the end of which they were spending before my eyes, with no\r\napparent purpose, in exploring their provisions. The time had not yet\r\ncome for them to change their skins and take their seats at the table.\r\nTheir fellows must still, for the most part, be wandering through the\r\npores of the masonry; and this was what made my search so vain at the\r\nstart.\r\n\r\nA few facts seem to suggest that the entrance into the cell may be\r\ndelayed for several months by the difficulty of the passages. There are\r\na few Anthrax grubs beside the remains of pupae not far removed from the\r\nfinal metamorphosis; there are others, but very rarely, on Mason bees\r\nalready in the perfect state. These grubs are sickly and appear to be\r\nailing; the provisions are too solid and do not lend themselves to\r\nthe delicate suckling of the worms. Who can these laggards be but\r\nanimalcules that have roamed too long in the walls of the nest? Failing\r\nto make their entrance at the proper time, they no longer find viands to\r\nsuit them. The primary larva of the Sitaris continues from the autumn to\r\nthe following spring. Even so the initial form of the Anthrax might well\r\ncontinue, not in inactivity, but in stubborn attempts to overcome the\r\nthick bulwark.\r\n\r\nMy young worms, when transferred with their provisions into tubes,\r\nremained stationary, on the average, for a couple of weeks. At last, I\r\nsaw them shrink and then rid themselves of their epidermis and become\r\nthe grub which I was so anxiously expecting as the final reply to all\r\nmy doubts. It was indeed, from the first, the grub of the Anthrax, the\r\ncream-colored cylinder with the little button of a head, followed by\r\na hump. Applying its cupping glass to the mason bee, the worm, without\r\ndelay, began its meal, which lasts another fortnight. The reader knows\r\nthe rest.\r\n\r\nBefore taking leave of the animalcule, let us devote a few lines to its\r\ninstinct. It has just awakened to life under the fierce kisses of the\r\nsun. The bare stone is its cradle, the rough clay its welcomer, as it\r\nmakes its entrance into the world, a poor thread of scarce cohering\r\nalbumen. But safety lies within; and behold the atom of animated glair\r\nembarking on its struggle with the flint. Obstinately, it sounds each\r\npore; it slips in, crawls on, retreats, begins again. The radical of the\r\ngerminating seed is no more persevering in its efforts to descend into\r\nthe cool earth than is the Anthrax grub in creeping into the lump of\r\nmortar. What inspiration urges it towards its food at the bottom of the\r\nclod, what compass guides it? What does it know of those depths, of what\r\nlies therein or where? Nothing. What does the root know of the earth's\r\nfruitfulness? Again nothing. Yet both make for the nourishing spot.\r\nTheories are put forward, most learned theories, introducing capillary\r\naction, osmosis and cellular imbibition, to explain why the caulicle\r\nascends and the radical descends. Shall physical or chemical forces\r\nexplain why the animalcule digs into the hard clay? I bow profoundly,\r\nwithout understanding or even trying to understand. The question is far\r\nabove, our inane means.\r\n\r\nThe biography of the Anthrax is now complete, save for the details\r\nrelating to the egg, as yet unknown. In the vast majority of insects\r\nsubject to metamorphoses, the hatching yields the larval form which\r\nwill remain unchanged until the nymphosis. By virtue of a remarkable\r\nvariation, revealing a new vein of observation to the entomologist,\r\nthe Anthrax flies, in the larval state, assume two successive shapes,\r\ndiffering greatly one from the other, both in structure and in the part\r\nwhich they are called upon to play. I will describe this double stage of\r\nthe organism by the phrase 'larval dimorphism.' The initial form, that\r\nissuing from the egg, I will call 'the primary larva;' the second form\r\nshall be 'the secondary larva.' Among the Anthrax flies, the function\r\nof the primary larva is to reach the provisions, on which the mother\r\nis unable to lay her egg. It is capable of moving and endowed with\r\nambulatory bristles, which allow the slim creature to glide through the\r\nsmallest interstices in the wall of a Bee's nest, to slip through the\r\nwoof of the cocoon and to make its way to the larva intended for its\r\nsuccessor's food. When this object is attained, its part is played.\r\nThen appears the secondary larva, deprived of any means of progression.\r\nRelegated to the inside of the invaded cell, as incapable of leaving\r\nit by its own efforts as it was of entering, this one has no mission in\r\nlife but that of eating. It is a stomach that loads itself, digests and\r\ngoes on adding to its reserves. Next comes the pupa, armed for the\r\nexit even as the primary larva was equipped for entering. When the\r\ndeliverance is accomplished, the perfect insect appears, busy with its\r\nlaying. The Anthrax cycle is thus divided into four periods, each of\r\nwhich corresponds with special forms and functions. The primary larva\r\nenters the casket containing provisions; the secondary larva consumes\r\nthese provisions; the pupa brings the insect to light by boring through\r\nthe enclosing wall; the perfect insect strews its eggs; and the cycle\r\nstarts afresh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. HEREDITY\r\n\r\nFacts which I have set forth elsewhere prove that certain dung beetles'\r\nmake an exception to the rule of paternal indifference--a general rule\r\nin the insect world--and know something of domestic cooperation. The\r\nfather works with almost the same zeal as the mother in providing for\r\nthe settlement of the family. Whence do these favored ones derive a gift\r\nthat borders on morality?\r\n\r\nOne might suggest the cost of installing the youngsters. Once they have\r\nto be furnished with a lodging and to be left the wherewithal to live,\r\nis it not an advantage, in the interests of the race, that the father\r\nshould come to the mother's assistance? Work divided between the two\r\nwill ensure the comfort which solitary work, its strength overtaxed,\r\nwould deny. This seems excellent reasoning; but it is much more often\r\ncontradicted than confirmed by the facts. Why is the Sisyphus a hard\r\nworking paterfamilias and the sacred beetle an idle vagabond? And yet\r\nthe two pill rollers practice the same industry and the same method\r\nof rearing their young. Why does the Lunary Copris know what his near\r\nkinsman, the Spanish Copris, does not? The first assists his mate, never\r\nforsakes her. The second seeks a divorce at an early stage and leaves\r\nthe nuptial roof before the children's rations are massed and kneaded\r\ninto shape. Nevertheless, on both sides, there is the same big outlay\r\non a cellarful of egg-shaped pills, whose neat rows call for long and\r\nwatchful supervision. The similarity of the produce leads one to believe\r\nin similarity of manners; and this is a mistake.\r\n\r\nLet us turn elsewhere, to the wasps and bees, who unquestionably come\r\nfirst in the laying up of a heritage for their offspring. Whether the\r\ntreasure hoarded for the benefit of the sons be a pot of honey or a bag\r\nof game, the father never takes the smallest part in the work. He does\r\nnot so much as give a sweep of the broom when it comes to tidying the\r\noutside of the dwelling. To do nothing is his invariable rule. The\r\nbringing up of the family, therefore, however expensive it may be in\r\ncertain cases, has not given rise to the instinct of paternity. Then\r\nwhere are we to look for a reply?\r\n\r\nLet us make the question a wider one. Let us leave the animal, for a\r\nmoment, and occupy ourselves with man. We have our own instincts, some\r\nof which take the name of genius when they attain a degree of might\r\nthat towers over the plain of mediocrity. We are amazed by the unusual,\r\nspringing out of flat commonplaces; we are spellbound by the luminous\r\nspeck shining in the wonted darkness. We admire; and, failing to\r\nunderstand whence came those glorious harvests in this one or in that,\r\nwe say of them: \"They have the gift.\"\r\n\r\nA goatherd amuses himself by making combinations with heaps of little\r\npebbles. He becomes an astoundingly quick and accurate reckoner without\r\nother aid than a moment's reflection. He terrifies us with the conflict\r\nof enormous numbers which blend in an orderly fashion in his mind, but\r\nwhose mere statement overwhelms us by its inextricable confusion. This\r\nmarvelous arithmetical juggler has an instinct, a genius, a gift for\r\nfigures.\r\n\r\nA second, at the age when most of us delight in tops and marbles, leaves\r\nthe company of his boisterous playmates and listens to the echo of\r\ncelestial harps singing within him. His head is a cathedral filled with\r\nthe strains of an imaginary organ. Rich cadences, a secret concert heard\r\nby him and him alone, steep him in ecstasy. All hail to that predestined\r\none who, some day, will rouse our noblest emotions with his musical\r\nchords. He has an instinct, a genius, a gift for sounds.\r\n\r\nA third, a brat who cannot yet eat his bread and jam without smearing\r\nhis face all over, takes a delight in fashioning clay into little\r\nfigures that are astonishingly lifelike for all their artless\r\nawkwardness. He takes a knife and makes the briar root grin into all\r\nsorts of entertaining masks; he carves boxwood in the semblance of a\r\nhorse or sheep; he engraves the effigy of his dog on sandstone. Leave\r\nhim alone; and, if Heaven second his efforts, he may become a famous\r\nsculptor. He has an instinct, a gift, a genius for form.\r\n\r\nAnd so with others in every branch of human activity: art and science,\r\nindustry and commerce, literature and philosophy. We have within us,\r\nfrom the start, that which will distinguish us from the vulgar herd.\r\nNow to what do we owe this distinctive character? To some throwback of\r\natavism, men tell us. Heredity, direct in one case, remote in another,\r\nhands it down to us, increased or modified by time. Search the records\r\nof the family and you will discover the source of the genius, a mere\r\ntrickle at first, then a stream, then a mighty river.\r\n\r\nThe darkness that lies behind that word heredity! Metaphysical science\r\nhas tried to throw a little light upon it and has succeeded only in\r\nmaking unto itself a barbarous jargon, leaving obscurity more obscure\r\nthan before. As for us, who hunger after lucidity, let us relinquish\r\nabstruse theories to whoever delights in them and confine our ambition\r\nto observable facts, without pretending to explain the quackery of\r\nthe plasma. Our method certainly will not reveal to us the origin of\r\ninstinct; but it will at least show us where it would be waste of time\r\nto look for it.\r\n\r\nIn this sort of research, a subject known through and through, down to\r\nits most intimate peculiarities, is indispensable. Where shall we find\r\nthat subject? There would be a host of them and magnificent ones, if it\r\nwere possible to read the sealed pages of others' lives; but no one can\r\nsound an existence outside his own and even then he can think himself\r\nlucky if a retentive memory and the habit of reflection give his\r\nsoundings the proper accuracy. As none of us is able to project himself\r\ninto another's skin, we must needs, in considering this problem, remain\r\ninside our own.\r\n\r\nTo talk about one's self is hateful, I know. The reader must have the\r\nkindness to excuse me for the sake of the study in hand. I shall take\r\nthe silent beetle's place in the witness box, cross-examining myself\r\nin all simplicity of soul, as I do the animal, and asking myself whence\r\nthat one of my instincts which stands out above the others is derived.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince Darwin bestowed upon me the title of 'incomparable observer,' the\r\nepithet has often come back to me, from this side and from that, without\r\nmy yet understanding what particular merit I have shown. It seems to me\r\nso natural, so much within everybody's scope, so absorbing to interest\r\none's self in everything that swarms around us! However, let us pass on\r\nand admit that the compliment is not unfounded.\r\n\r\nMy hesitation ceases if it is a question of admitting my curiosity in\r\nmatters that concern the insect. Yes, I possess the gift, the instinct\r\nthat impels me to frequent that singular world; yes, I know that I am\r\ncapable of spending on those studies an amount of precious time which\r\nwould be better employed in making provision, if possible, for the\r\npoverty of old age; yes, I confess that I am an enthusiastic observer of\r\nthe animal. How was this characteristic propensity, at once the torment\r\nand delight of my life, developed? And, to begin with, how much does it\r\nowe to heredity?\r\n\r\nThe common people have no history: persecuted by the present, they\r\ncannot think of preserving the memory of the past. And yet what\r\nsurpassingly instructive records, comforting too and pious, would be the\r\nfamily papers that should tell us who our forebears were and speak to\r\nus of their patient struggles with harsh fate, their stubborn efforts to\r\nbuild up, atom by atom, what we are today. No story would come up with\r\nthat for individual interest. But by the very force of things the home\r\nis abandoned; and, when the brood has flown, the nest is no longer\r\nrecognized.\r\n\r\nI, a humble journeyman in the toilers' hive, am therefore very poor in\r\nfamily recollections. In the second degree of ancestry, my facts become\r\nsuddenly obscured. I will linger over them a moment for two reasons:\r\nfirst, to inquire into the influence of heredity; and, secondly, to\r\nleave my children yet one more page concerning them.\r\n\r\nI did not know my maternal grandfather. This venerable ancestor was, I\r\nhave been told, a process server in one of the poorest parishes of the\r\nRouergue. He used to engross on stamped paper in a primitive spelling.\r\nWith his well-filled pen case and ink horn, he went drawing out deeds up\r\nhill and down dale, from one insolvent wretch to another more insolvent\r\nstill. Amid his atmosphere of pettifoggery, this rudimentary scholar,\r\nwaging battle on life's acerbities, certainly paid no attention to the\r\ninsect; at most, if he met it, he would crush it under foot. The\r\nunknown animal, suspected of evil doing, deserved no further enquiry.\r\nGrandmother, on her side, apart from her housekeeping and her beads,\r\nknew still less about anything. She looked on the alphabet as a set of\r\nhieroglyphics only fit to spoil your sight for nothing, unless you were\r\nscribbling on paper bearing the government stamp. Who in the world, in\r\nher day, among the small folk, dreamt of knowing how to read and write?\r\nThat luxury was reserved for the attorney, who himself made but a\r\nsparing use of it. The insect, I need hardly say, was the least of her\r\ncares. If sometimes, when rinsing her salad at the tap, she found a\r\ncaterpillar on the lettuce leaves, with a start of fright she would\r\nfling the loathsome thing away, thus cutting short relations reputed\r\ndangerous. In short, to both my maternal grandparents, the insect was a\r\ncreature of no interest whatever and almost always a repulsive object,\r\nwhich one dared not touch with the tip of one's finger. Beyond a doubt,\r\nmy taste for animals was not derived from them.\r\n\r\nI have more precise information regarding my grandparents on the\r\nfather's side, for their green old age allowed me to know them both.\r\nThey were people of the soil, whose quarrel with the alphabet was so\r\ngreat that they had never opened a book in their lives; and they kept\r\na lean farm on the cold granite ridge of the Rouergue tableland. The\r\nhouse, standing alone among the heath and broom, with no neighbor for\r\nmany a mile around and visited at intervals by the wolves, was to them\r\nthe hub of the universe. But for a few surrounding villages, whither the\r\ncalves were driven on fair days, the rest was only very vaguely known\r\nby hearsay. In this wild solitude, the mossy fens, with their quagmires\r\noozing with iridescent pools, supplied the cows, the principal source\r\nof wealth, with rich, wet grass. In summer, on the short swards of the\r\nslopes, the sheep were penned day and night, protected from beasts of\r\nprey by a fence of hurdles propped up with pitchforks. When the grass\r\nwas cropped close at one spot, the fold was shifted elsewhere. In the\r\ncenter was the shepherd's rolling hut, a straw cabin. Two watchdogs,\r\nequipped with spiked collars, were answerable for tranquillity if the\r\nthieving wolf appeared in the night from out the neighboring woods.\r\n\r\nPadded with a perpetual layer of cow dung, in which I sank to my knees,\r\nbroken up with shimmering puddles of dark brown liquid manure, the\r\nfarmyard also boasted a numerous population. Here the lambs skipped, the\r\ngeese trumpeted, the fowls scratched the ground and the sow grunted with\r\nher swarm of little pigs hanging to her dugs.\r\n\r\nThe harshness of the climate did not give husbandry the same chances.\r\nIn a propitious season, they would set fire to a stretch of moorland\r\nbristling with gorse and send the swing plow across the ground enriched\r\nwith the cinders of the blaze. This yielded a few acres of rye, oats\r\nand potatoes. The best corners were kept for hemp, which furnished the\r\ndistaffs and spindles of the house with the material for linen and was\r\nlooked upon as grandmother's private crop.\r\n\r\nGrandfather, therefore, was, before all, a herdsman versed in matters of\r\ncows and sheep, but completely ignorant of aught else. How dumbfounded\r\nhe would have been to learn that, in the remote future, one of his\r\nfamily would become enamoured of those insignificant animals to which\r\nhe had never vouchsafed a glance in his life! Had he guessed that that\r\nlunatic was myself, the scapegrace seated at the table by his side, what\r\na smack I should have caught in the neck, what a wrathful look!\r\n\r\n\"The idea of wasting one's time with that nonsense!\" he would have\r\nthundered.\r\n\r\nFor the patriarch was not given to joking. I can still see his serious\r\nface, his unclipped head of hair, often brought back behind his ears\r\nwith a flick of the thumb and spreading its ancient Gallic mane over\r\nhis shoulders. I see his little three-cornered hat, his small clothes\r\nbuckled at the knees, his wooden shoes, stuffed with straw, that echoed\r\nas he walked. Ah, no! Once childhood's games were past, it would never\r\nhave done to rear the Grasshopper and unearth the Dung beetle from his\r\nnatural surroundings.\r\n\r\nGrandmother, pious soul, used to wear the eccentric headdress of the\r\nRouergue highlanders: a large disk of black felt, stiff as a plank,\r\nadorned in the middle with a crown a finger's breadth high and hardly\r\nwider across than a six franc piece. A black ribbon fastened under the\r\nchin maintained the equilibrium of this elegant, but unsteady circle.\r\nPickles, hemp, chickens, curds and whey, butter; washing the clothes,\r\nminding the children, seeing to the meals of the household: say that\r\nand you have summed up the strenuous woman's round of ideas. On her left\r\nside, the distaff, with its load of flax; in her right hand, the spindle\r\nturning under a quick twist of her thumb, moistened at intervals with\r\nher tongue: so she went through life, unwearied, attending to the order\r\nand the welfare of the house. I see her in my mind's eye particularly on\r\nwinter evenings, which were more favorable to family talk. When the hour\r\ncame for meals, all of us, big and little, would take our seats round\r\na long table, on a couple of benches, deal planks supported by four\r\nrickety legs. Each found his wooden bowl and his tin spoon in front of\r\nhim. At one end of the table always stood an enormous rye loaf, the\r\nsize of a cartwheel, wrapped in a linen cloth with a pleasant smell\r\nof washing, and remained until nothing was left of it. With a vigorous\r\nstroke, grandfather would cut off enough for the needs of the moment;\r\nthen he would divide the piece among us with the one knife which he\r\nalone was entitled to wield. It was now each one's business to break up\r\nhis bit with his fingers and to fill his bowl as he pleased.\r\n\r\nNext came grandmother's turn. A capacious pot bubbled lustily and sang\r\nupon the flames in the hearth, exhaling an appetizing savor of bacon and\r\nturnips. Armed with a long metal ladle, grandmother would take from it,\r\nfor each of us in turn, first the broth, wherein to soak the bread,\r\nand next the ration of turnips and bacon, partly fat and partly lean,\r\nfilling the bowl to the top. At the other end of the table was the\r\npitcher, from which the thirsty were free to drink at will. What\r\nappetites we had and what festive meals those were, especially when a\r\ncream cheese, homemade, was there to complete the banquet!\r\n\r\nNear us blazed the huge fireplace, in which whole tree trunks were\r\nconsumed in the extreme cold weather. From a corner of that monumental,\r\nsoot-glazed chimney, projected, at a convenient height, a bracket with\r\na slate shelf, which served to light the kitchen when we sat up late. On\r\nthis we burnt chips of pine wood, selected among the most translucent,\r\nthose containing the most resin. They shed over the room a lurid red\r\nlight, which saved the walnut oil in the lamp.\r\n\r\nWhen the bowls were emptied and the last crumb of cheese scraped up,\r\ngrandam went back to her distaff, on a stool by the chimney corner. We\r\nchildren, boys and girls, squatting on our heels and putting out our\r\nhands to the cheerful fire of furze, formed a circle round her and\r\nlistened to her with eager ears. She told us stories, not greatly\r\nvaried, it is true, but still wonderful, for the wolf often played a\r\npart in them. I should have very much liked to see this wolf, the hero\r\nof so many tales that made our flesh creep; but the shepherd always\r\nrefused to take me into his straw hut, in the middle of the fold, at\r\nnight. When we had done talking about the horrid wolf, the dragon and\r\nthe serpent and when the resinous splinters had given out their last\r\ngleams, we went to sleep the sweet sleep that toil gives. As the\r\nyoungest of the household, I had a right to the mattress, a sack stuffed\r\nwith oat chaff. The others had to be content with straw.\r\n\r\nI owe a great deal to you, dear grandmother: it was in your lap that\r\nI found consolation for my first sorrows. You have handed down to me,\r\nperhaps, a little of your physical vigor, a little of your love of\r\nwork; but certainly you were no more accountable than grandfather for my\r\npassion for insects.\r\n\r\nNor was either of my own parents. My mother, who was quite illiterate,\r\nhaving known no teacher than the bitter experience of a harassed life,\r\nwas the exact opposite of what my tastes required for their development.\r\nMy peculiarity must seek its origin elsewhere: that I will swear. But\r\nI do not find it in my father, either. The excellent man, who was hard\r\nworking and sturdily built like granddad, had been to school as a\r\nchild. He knew how to write, though he took the greatest liberties with\r\nspelling; he knew how to read and understood what he read, provided the\r\nreading presented no more serious literary difficulties than occurred\r\nin the stories in the almanac. He was the first of his line to allow\r\nhimself to be tempted by the town and he lived to regret it. Badly off,\r\nhaving but little outlet for his industry, making God knows what shifts\r\nto pick up a livelihood, he went through all the disappointments of the\r\ncountryman turned townsman. Persecuted by bad luck, borne down by\r\nthe burden, for all his energy and good will, he was far indeed from\r\nstarting me in entomology. He had other cares, cares more direct and\r\nmore serious. A good cuff or two when he saw me pinning an insect to a\r\ncork was all the encouragement that I received from him. Perhaps he was\r\nright.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion is positive: there is nothing in heredity to explain my\r\ntaste for observation. You may say that I do not go far enough back.\r\nWell, what should I find beyond the grandparents where my facts come to\r\na stop? I know, partly. I should find even more uncultured ancestors:\r\nsons of the soil, plowmen, sowers of rye, neat herds; one and all, by\r\nthe very force of things, of not the least account in the nice matters\r\nof observation.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, in me, the observer, the inquirer into things began to take\r\nshape almost in infancy. Why should I not describe my first discoveries?\r\nThey are ingenuous in the extreme, but will serve notwithstanding to\r\ntell us something of the way in which tendencies first show themselves.\r\nI was five or six years old. That the poor household might have one\r\nmouth less to feed, I had been placed in grandmother's care, as I have\r\njust been saying. Here, in solitude, my first gleams of intelligence\r\nwere awakened amidst the geese, the calves and the sheep. Everything\r\nbefore that is impenetrable darkness. My real birth is at that\r\nmoment when the dawn of personality rises, dispersing the mists of\r\nunconsciousness and leaving a lasting memory. I can see myself plainly,\r\nclad in a soiled frieze frock flapping against my bare heels; I\r\nremember the handkerchief hanging from my waist by a bit of string, a\r\nhandkerchief often lost and replaced by the back of my sleeve.\r\n\r\nThere I stand one day, a pensive urchin, with my hands behind my back\r\nand my face turned to the sun. The dazzling splendor fascinates me. I am\r\nthe Moth attracted by the light of the lamp. With what am I enjoying the\r\nglorious radiance: with my mouth or my eyes? That is the question put\r\nby my budding scientific curiosity. Reader, do not smile: the future\r\nobserver is already practicing and experimenting. I open my mouth wide\r\nand close my eyes: the glory disappears. I open my eyes and shut my\r\nmouth: the glory reappears. I repeat the performance, with the same\r\nresult. The question's solved: I have learnt by deduction that I see the\r\nsun with my eyes. Oh, what a discovery! That evening, I told the whole\r\nhouse all about it. Grandmother smiled fondly at my simplicity: the\r\nothers laughed at it. 'Tis the way of the world.\r\n\r\nAnother find. At nightfall, amidst the neighboring bushes, a sort of\r\njingle attracted my attention, sounding very faintly and softly through\r\nthe evening silence. Who is making that noise? Is it a little bird\r\nchirping in his nest? We must look into the matter and that quickly.\r\nTrue, there is the wolf, who comes out of the woods at this time, so\r\nthey tell me. Let's go all the same, but not too far: just there, behind\r\nthat clump of groom. I stand on the look out for long, but all in vain.\r\nAt the faintest sound of movement in the brushwood, the jingle ceases.\r\nI try again next day and the day after. This time, my stubborn watch\r\nsucceeds. Whoosh! A grab of my hand and I hold the singer. It is not a\r\nbird; it is a kind of Grasshopper whose hind legs my playfellows have\r\ntaught me to like: a poor recompense for my prolonged ambush. The best\r\npart of the business is not the two haunches with the shrimpy flavor,\r\nbut what I have just learnt. I now know, from personal observation, that\r\nthe Grasshopper sings. I did not publish my discovery, for fear of the\r\nsame laughter that greeted my story about the sun.\r\n\r\nOh, what pretty flowers, in a field close to the house! They seem to\r\nsmile to me with their great violet eyes. Later on, I see, in their\r\nplace, bunches of big red cherries. I taste them. They are not nice\r\nand they have no stones. What can those cherries be? At the end of the\r\nsummer, grandfather comes with a spade and turns my field of observation\r\ntopsy-turvy. From under ground there comes, by the basketful and\r\nsackful, a sort of round root. I know that root; it abounds in the\r\nhouse; time after time I have cooked it in the peat stove. It is the\r\npotato. Its violet flower and its red fruit are pigeonholed for good and\r\nall in my memory.\r\n\r\nWith an ever watchful eye for animals and plants, the future observer,\r\nthe little six-year-old monkey, practiced by himself, all unawares.\r\nHe went to the flower, he went to the insect, even as the large white\r\nbutterfly goes to the cabbage and the red admiral to the thistle. He\r\nlooked and inquired, drawn by a curiosity whereof heredity did not know\r\nthe secret. He bore within him the germ of a faculty unknown to his\r\nfamily; he kept alive a glimmer that was foreign to the ancestral\r\nhearth. What will become of that infinitesimal spark of childish fancy?\r\nIt will die out, beyond a doubt, unless education intervene, giving it\r\nthe fuel of example, fanning it with the breath of experience. In that\r\ncase, schooling will explain what heredity leaves unexplained. This is\r\nwhat we will examine in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. MY SCHOOLING\r\n\r\nI am back in the village, in my father's house. I am now seven years\r\nold; and it is high time that I went to school. Nothing could have\r\nturned out better: the master is my godfather. What shall I call the\r\nroom in which I was to become acquainted with the alphabet? It would\r\nbe difficult to find the exact word, because the room served for every\r\npurpose. It was at once a school, a kitchen, a bedroom, a dining room\r\nand, at times, a chicken house and a piggery. Palatial schools were not\r\ndreamt of in those days; any wretched hovel was thought good enough.\r\n\r\nA broad fixed ladder led to the floor above. Under the ladder stood\r\na big bed in a boarded recess. What was there upstairs? I never quite\r\nknew. I would see the master sometimes bring down an armful of hay for\r\nthe ass, sometimes a basket of potatoes which the housewife emptied into\r\nthe pot in which the little porkers' food was cooked. It must have been\r\na loft of sorts, a storehouse of provisions for man and beast. Those two\r\napartments composed the whole building.\r\n\r\nTo return to the lower one, the schoolroom: a window faces south, the\r\nonly window in the house, a low, narrow window whose frame you can touch\r\nat the same time with your head and both your shoulders. This sunny\r\naperture is the only lively spot in the dwelling, it overlooks the\r\ngreater part of the village, which straggles along the slopes of a\r\nslanting valley. In the window recess is the master's little table.\r\n\r\nThe opposite wall contains a niche in which stands a gleaming copper\r\npail full of water. Here the parched children can relieve their thirst\r\nwhen they please, with a cup left within their reach. At the top of the\r\nniche are a few shelves bright with pewter plates, dishes and drinking\r\nvessels, which are taken down from their sanctuary on great occasions\r\nonly.\r\n\r\nMore or less everywhere, at any spot which the light touches, are\r\ncrudely colored pictures, pasted on the walls. Here is Our Lady of the\r\nSeven Dolours, the disconsolate Mother of God opening her blue cloak\r\nto show her heart pierced with seven daggers. Between the sun and moon,\r\nwhich stare at you with their great, round eyes, is the Eternal Father,\r\nwhose robe swells as though puffed out with the storm. To the right\r\nof the window, in the embrasure, is the Wandering Jew. He wears a\r\nthree-cornered hat, a large, white leather apron, hobnailed shoes and a\r\nstout stick. 'Never was such a bearded man seen before or after,' says\r\nthe legend that surrounds the picture. The draftsman has not forgotten\r\nthis detail: the old man's beard spreads in a snowy avalanche over the\r\napron and comes down to his knees. On the left is Genevieve of Brabant,\r\naccompanied by the roe, with fierce Golo hiding in the bushes, sword in\r\nhand. Above hangs The Death of Mr. Credit, slain by defaulters at the\r\ndoor of his inn; and so on and so on, in every variety of subject, at\r\nall the unoccupied spots of the four walls.\r\n\r\nI was filled with admiration of this picture gallery, which held one's\r\neyes with its great patches of red, blue, green and yellow. The master,\r\nhowever, had not set up his collection with a view to training our minds\r\nand hearts. That was the last and least of the worthy man's ambitions.\r\nAn artist in his fashion, he had adorned his house according to his\r\ntaste; and we benefited by the scheme of decoration.\r\n\r\nWhile the gallery of halfpenny pictures made me happy all the year\r\nround, there was another entertainment which I found particularly\r\nattractive in winter, in frosty weather, when the snow lay long on the\r\nground. Against the far wall stands the fireplace, as monumental in size\r\nas at my grandmother's. Its arched cornice occupies the whole width of\r\nthe room, for the enormous redoubt fulfils more than one purpose. In the\r\nmiddle is the hearth, but, on the right and left, are two breast-high\r\nrecesses, half wood and half stone. Each of them is a bed, with a\r\nmattress stuffed with chaff of winnowed corn. Two sliding planks serve\r\nas shutters and close the chest if the sleeper would be alone. This\r\ndormitory, sheltered under the chimney mantel, supplies couches for the\r\nfavored ones of the house, the two boarders. They must lie snug in there\r\nat night, with their shutters closed, when the north wind howls at the\r\nmouth of the dark valley and sends the snow awhirl. The rest is occupied\r\nby the hearth and its accessories: the three-legged stools; the salt\r\nbox, hanging against the wall to keep its contents dry; the heavy shovel\r\nwhich it takes two hands to wield; lastly, the bellows similar to those\r\nwith which I used to blow out my cheeks in grandfather's house. They\r\nconsist of a mighty branch of pine, hollowed throughout its length with\r\na red-hot iron. By means of this channel, one's breath is applied, from\r\na convenient distance, to the spot which is to be revived. With a couple\r\nof stones for supports, the master's bundle of sticks and our own logs\r\nblaze and flicker, each of us having to bring a log of wood in the\r\nmorning, if he would share in the treat.\r\n\r\nFor that matter, the fire was not exactly lit for us, but, above all, to\r\nwarm a row of three pots in which simmered the pigs' food, a mixture\r\nof potatoes and bran. That, despite the tribute of a log, was the real\r\nobject of the brushwood fire. The two boarders, on their stools, in\r\nthe best places, and we others sitting on our heels formed a semicircle\r\naround those big cauldrons, full to the brim and giving off little jets\r\nof steam, with puff-puff-puffing sounds. The bolder among us, when the\r\nmaster's eyes were engaged elsewhere, would dig a knife into a well\r\ncooked potato and add it to their bit of bread; for I must say that, if\r\nwe did little work in my school, at least we did a deal of eating. It\r\nwas the regular custom to crack a few nuts and nibble at a crust while\r\nwriting our page or setting out our rows of figures.\r\n\r\nWe, the smaller ones, in addition to the comfort of studying with our\r\nmouths full, had every now and then two other delights, which were quite\r\nas good as cracking nuts. The back door communicated with the yard where\r\nthe hen, surrounded by her brood of chicks, scratched at the dung hill,\r\nwhile the little porkers, of whom there were a dozen, wallowed in their\r\nstone trough. This door would open sometimes to let one of us out, a\r\nprivilege which we abused, for the sly ones among us were careful not to\r\nclose it on returning. Forthwith, the porkers would come running in,\r\none after the other, attracted by the smell of the boiled potatoes. My\r\nbench, the one where the youngsters sat, stood against the wall, under\r\nthe copper pail to which we used to go for water when the nuts had made\r\nus thirsty, and was right in the way of the pigs. Up they came trotting\r\nand grunting, curling their little tails; they rubbed against our legs;\r\nthey poked their cold pink snouts into our hands in search of a scrap\r\nof crust; they questioned us with their sharp little eyes to learn if we\r\nhappened to have a dry chestnut for them in our pockets. When they\r\nhad gone the round, some this way and some that, they went back to the\r\nfarmyard, driven away by a friendly flick of the master's handkerchief.\r\nNext came the visit of the hen, bringing her velvet-coated chicks to see\r\nus. All of us eagerly crumbled a little bread for our pretty visitors.\r\nWe vied with one another in calling them to us and tickling with our\r\nfingers their soft and downy backs. No, there was certainly no lack of\r\ndistractions.\r\n\r\nWhat could we learn in such a school as that! Let us first speak of the\r\nyoung ones, of whom I was one. Each of us had, or rather was supposed\r\nto have, in his hands a little penny book, the alphabet, printed on gray\r\npaper. It began, on the cover, with a pigeon, or something like it. Next\r\ncame a cross, followed by the letters in their order. When we turned\r\nover, our eyes encountered the terrible ba, be, bi, bo, bu, the\r\nstumbling block of most of us. When we had mastered that formidable\r\npage, we were considered to know how to read and were admitted among the\r\nbig ones. But, if the little book was to be of any use, the least that\r\nwas required was that the master should interest himself in us to some\r\nextent and show us how to set about things. For this, the worthy man,\r\ntoo much taken up with the big ones, had not the time. The famous\r\nalphabet with the pigeon was thrust upon us only to give us the air of\r\nscholars. We were to contemplate it on our bench, to decipher it with\r\nthe help of our next neighbor, in case he might know one or two of the\r\nletters. Our contemplation came to nothing, being every moment disturbed\r\nby a visit to the potatoes in the stew pots, a quarrel among playmates\r\nabout a marble, the grunting invasion of the porkers or the arrival of\r\nthe chicks. With the aid of these distractions, we would wait patiently\r\nuntil it was time for us to go home. That was our most serious work.\r\n\r\nThe big ones used to write. They had the benefit of the small amount\r\nof light in the room, by the narrow window where the Wandering Jew and\r\nruthless Golo faced each other, and of the large and only table with its\r\ncircle of seats. The school supplied nothing, not even a drop of ink;\r\nevery one had to come with a full set of utensils. The inkhorn of those\r\ndays, a relic of the ancient pen case of which Rabelais speaks, was a\r\nlong cardboard box divided into two stages. The upper compartment held\r\nthe pens, made of goose or turkey quills trimmed with a penknife; the\r\nlower contained, in a tiny well, ink made of soot mixed with vinegar.\r\n\r\nThe master's great business was to mend the pens--a delicate work, not\r\nwithout danger for inexperienced fingers--and then to trace at the head\r\nof the white page a line of strokes, single letters or words, according\r\nto the scholar's capabilities. When that is over, keep an eye on the\r\nwork of art which is coming to adorn the copy! With what undulating\r\nmovements of the wrist does the hand, resting on the little finger,\r\nprepare and plan its flight! All at once, the hand starts off, flies,\r\nwhirls; and, lo and behold, under the line of writing is unfurled\r\na garland of circles, spirals and flourishes, framing a bird with\r\noutspread wings, the whole, if you please, in red ink, the only kind\r\nworthy of such a pen. Large and small, we stood awestruck in the\r\npresence of these marvels. The family, in the evening, after supper,\r\nwould pass from hand to hand the masterpiece brought back from school:\r\n'What a man!' was the comment. 'What a man, to draw you a Holy Ghost\r\nwith a stroke of the pen!'\r\n\r\nWhat was read at my school? At most, in French, a few selections from\r\nsacred history. Latin recurred oftener, to teach us to sing vespers\r\nproperly. The more advanced pupils tried to decipher manuscript, a deed\r\nof sale, the hieroglyphics of some scrivener.\r\n\r\nAnd history, geography? No one ever heard of them. What difference did\r\nit make to us whether the earth was round or square! In either case, it\r\nwas just as hard to make it bring forth anything.\r\n\r\nAnd grammar? The master troubled his head very little about that; and we\r\nstill less. We should have been greatly surprised by the novelty and the\r\nforbidding look of such words in the grammatical jargon as substantive,\r\nindicative and subjunctive. Accuracy of language, whether of speech\r\nor writing, must be learnt by practice. And none of us was troubled\r\nby scruples in this respect. What was the use of all these subtleties,\r\nwhen, on coming out of school, a lad simply went back to his flock of\r\nsheep!\r\n\r\nAnd arithmetic? Yes, we did a little of this but not under that learned\r\nname. We called it sums. To put down rows of figures, not too long,\r\nadd them and subtract them one from the other was more or less familiar\r\nwork. On Saturday evenings, to finish up the week, there was a general\r\norgy of sums. The top boy stood up and, in a loud voice, recited the\r\nmultiplication table up to twelve times. I say twelve times, for in\r\nthose days, because of our old duodecimal measures, it was the custom to\r\ncount as far as the twelve times table, instead of the ten times of the\r\nmetric system. When this recital was over, the whole class, the little\r\nones included, took it up in chorus, creating such an uproar that chicks\r\nand porkers took to flight if they happened to be there. And this went\r\non to twelve times twelve, the first in the row starting the next table\r\nand the whole class repeating it as loud as it could yell. Of all that\r\nwe were taught in school, the multiplication table was what we knew\r\nbest, for this noisy method ended by dinning the different numbers\r\ninto our ears. This does not mean that we became skilful reckoners. The\r\ncleverest of us easily got muddled with the figures to be carried in a\r\nmultiplication sum. As for division, rare indeed were they who reached\r\nsuch heights. In short, the moment a problem, however insignificant, had\r\nto be solved, we had recourse to mental gymnastics much rather than to\r\nthe learned aid of arithmetic.\r\n\r\nWhen all is said, our master was an excellent man who could have kept\r\nschool very well but for his lack of one thing; and that was time. He\r\ndevoted to us all the little leisure which his numerous functions\r\nleft him. And, first of all, he managed the property of an absentee\r\nlandowner, who only occasionally set foot in the village. He had under\r\nhis care an old castle with four towers, which had become so many pigeon\r\nhouses; he directed the getting in of the hay, the walnuts, the apples\r\nand the oats. We used to help him during the summer, when the school,\r\nwhich was well attended in winter, was almost deserted. All that\r\nremained, because they were not yet big enough to work in the fields,\r\nwere a few children, including him who was one day to set down these\r\nmemorable facts. Lessons at that time were less dull. They were often\r\ngiven on the hay or on the straw; oftener still, lesson time was spent\r\nin cleaning out the dovecote or stamping on the snails that had sallied\r\nin rainy weather from their fortresses, the tall box borders of the\r\ngarden belonging to the castle.\r\n\r\nOur master was a barber. With his light hand, which was so clever at\r\nbeautifying our copies with curlicue birds, he shaved the notabilities\r\nof the place: the mayor, the parish priest, the notary. Our master was a\r\nbell ringer. A wedding or a christening interrupted the lessons: he had\r\nto ring a peal. A gathering storm gave us a holiday: the great bell must\r\nbe tolled to ward off the lightning and the hail. Our master was a choir\r\nsinger. With his mighty voice, he filled the church when he led the\r\nMagnificat at vespers. Our master wound up and regulated the village\r\nclock. This was his proudest function. Giving a glance at the sun, to\r\nascertain the time more or less nearly, he would climb to the top of\r\nthe steeple, open a huge cage of rafters and find himself in a maze of\r\nwheels and springs whereof the secret was known to him alone.\r\n\r\nWith such a school and such a master and such examples, what will become\r\nof my embryo tastes, as yet so imperceptible? In that environment, they\r\nseem bound to perish, stifled for ever. Yet no, the germ has life;\r\nit works in my veins, never to leave them again. It finds nourishment\r\neverywhere, down to the cover of my penny alphabet, embellished with\r\na crude picture of a pigeon which I study and contemplate much more\r\nzealously than the A B C. Its round eye, with its circlet of dots, seems\r\nto smile upon me. Its wing, of which I count the feathers one by one,\r\ntells me of flights on high, among the beautiful clouds; it carries me\r\nto the beeches raising their smooth trunks above a mossy carpet studded\r\nwith white mushrooms that look like eggs dropped by some vagrant hen; it\r\ntakes me to the snow-clad peaks where the birds leave the starry print\r\nof their red feet. He is a fine fellow, my pigeon friend: he consoles\r\nme for the woes hidden behind the cover of my book. Thanks to him, I sit\r\nquietly on my bench and wait more or less till school is over.\r\n\r\nSchool out of doors has other charms. When the master takes us to kill\r\nthe snails in the box borders, I do not always scrupulously fulfil my\r\noffice as an exterminator. My heel sometimes hesitates before coming\r\ndown upon the handful which I have gathered. They are so pretty! Just\r\nthink, there are yellow ones and pink, white ones and brown, all with\r\ndark spiral streaks. I fill my pockets with the handsomest, so as to\r\nfeast my eyes on them at my leisure.\r\n\r\nOn hay making days in the master's field, I strike up an acquaintance\r\nwith the frog. Flayed and stuck at the end of a split stick, he serves\r\nas bait to tempt the crayfish to come out of his retreat by the brook\r\nside. On the alder trees I catch the Hoplia, the splendid scarab who\r\npales the azure of the heavens. I pick the narcissus and learn to\r\ngather, with the tip of my tongue, the tiny drop of honey that lies\r\nright at the bottom of the cleft corolla. I also learn that too long\r\nindulgence in this feast brings a headache; but this discomfort in no\r\nway impairs my admiration for the glorious white flower, which wears a\r\nnarrow red collar at the throat of its funnel.\r\n\r\nWhen we go to beat the walnut trees, the barren grass plots provide me\r\nwith locusts spreading their wings, some into a blue fan, others into a\r\nred. And thus the rustic school, even in the heart of winter, furnished\r\ncontinuous food for my interest in things. There was no need for precept\r\nand example: my passion for animals and plants made progress of itself.\r\n\r\nWhat did not make progress was my acquaintance with my letters, greatly\r\nneglected in favor of the pigeon. I was still at the same stage,\r\nhopelessly behindhand with the intractable alphabet, when my father, by\r\na chance inspiration, brought me home from the town what was destined to\r\ngive me a start along the road of reading. Despite the not insignificant\r\npart which it played in my intellectual awakening, the purchase was\r\nby no means a ruinous one. It was a large print, price six farthings,\r\ncolored and divided into compartments in which animals of all sorts\r\ntaught the A B C by means of the first letters of their names.\r\n\r\nWhere should I keep the precious picture? As it happened, in the room\r\nset apart for the children at home, there was a little window like the\r\none in the school, opening in the same way out of a sort of recess and\r\nin the same way overlooking most of the village. One was on the right,\r\nthe other on the left of the castle with the pigeon house towers; both\r\nafforded an equally good view of the heights of the slanting valley.\r\nI was able to enjoy the school window only at rare intervals, when the\r\nmaster left his little table; the other was at my disposal as often as I\r\nliked. I spent long hours there, sitting on a little fixed window seat.\r\n\r\nThe view was magnificent. I could see the ends of the earth, that is\r\nto say, the hills that blocked the horizon, all but a misty gap through\r\nwhich the brook with the crayfish flowed under the alders and willows.\r\nHigh up on the skyline, a few wind-battered oaks bristled on the ridges;\r\nand beyond there lay nothing but the unknown, laden with mystery.\r\n\r\nAt the back of the hollow stood the church, with its three steeples and\r\nits clock; and, a little higher, the village square, where a spring,\r\nfashioned into a fountain, gurgled from one basin into another, under a\r\nwide arched roof. I could hear from my window the chatter of the women\r\nwashing their clothes, the strokes of their beaters, the rasping of the\r\npots scoured with sand and vinegar. Sprinkled over the slopes are little\r\nhouses with their garden patches in terraces banked up by tottering\r\nwalls, which bulge under the thrust of the earth. Here and there are\r\nvery steep lanes, with the dents of the rock forming a natural pavement.\r\nThe mule, sure-footed though he be, would hesitate to enter these\r\ndangerous passes with his load of branches.\r\n\r\nFurther on, beyond the village, half-way up the hills, stood the great\r\never-so-old lime tree, the Tel, as we used to call it, whose sides,\r\nhollowed out by the ages, were the favorite hiding places of us children\r\nat play. On fair days, its immense, spreading foliage cast a wide shadow\r\nover the herds of oxen and sheep. Those solemn days, which only came\r\nonce a year, brought me a few ideas from without: I learnt that the\r\nworld did not end with my amphitheater of hills. I saw the inn keeper's\r\nwine arrive on mule back and in goat skin bottles. I hung about the\r\nmarket place and watched the opening of jars full of stewed pears, the\r\nsetting out of baskets of grapes, an almost unknown fruit, the object\r\nof eager covetousness. I stood and gazed in admiration at the roulette\r\nboard on which, for a sou, according to the spot at which its needle\r\nstopped on a circular row of nails, you won a pink poodle made of barley\r\nsugar, or a round jar of aniseed sweets, or, much oftener, nothing at\r\nall. On a piece of canvas on the ground, rolls of printed calico with\r\nred flowers, were displayed to tempt the girls. Close by rose a pile of\r\nbeechwood clogs, tops and boxwood flutes. Here the shepherds chose their\r\ninstruments, trying them by blowing a note or two. How new it all was\r\nto me! What a lot of things there were to see in this world! Alas,\r\nthat wonderful time was of but short duration! At night, after a little\r\nbrawling at the inn, it was all over; and the village returned to\r\nsilence for a year.\r\n\r\nBut I must not linger over these memories of the dawn of life. We were\r\nspeaking of the memorable picture brought from town. Where shall I keep\r\nit, to make the best use of it? Why, of course, it must be pasted on\r\nthe embrasure of my window. The recess, with its seat, shall be my study\r\ncell; here I can feast my eyes by turns on the big lime tree and the\r\nanimals of my alphabet. And this was what I did.\r\n\r\nAnd now, my precious picture, it is our turn, yours and mine. You began\r\nwith the sacred beast, the ass, whose name, with a big initial, taught\r\nme the letter A. The boeuf, the ox, stood for B; the canard, the duck,\r\ntold me about C; the dindon, the turkey, gave me the letter D. And so\r\non with the rest. A few compartments, it is true, were lacking in\r\nclearness. I had no friendly feeling for the hippopotamus, the kamichi,\r\nor horned screamer, and the zebu, who aimed at making me say H, K and\r\nZ. Those outlandish beasts, which failed to give the abstract letter the\r\nsupport of a recognized reality, caused me to hesitate for a time over\r\ntheir recalcitrant consonants. No matter: father came to my aid in\r\ndifficult cases; and I made such rapid progress that, in a few days,\r\nI was able to turn in good earnest the pages of my little pigeon book,\r\nhitherto so undecipherable. I was initiated; I knew how to spell. My\r\nparents marveled. I can explain this unexpected progress today. Those\r\nspeaking pictures, which brought me amongst my friends the beasts, were\r\nin harmony with my instincts. If the animal has not fulfilled all that\r\nit promised in so far as I am concerned, I have at least to thank it for\r\nteaching me to read. I should have succeeded by other means, I do not\r\ndoubt, but not so quickly nor so pleasantly. Animals forever!\r\n\r\nLuck favored me a second time. As a reward for my prowess, I was\r\ngiven La Fontaine's Fables, in a popular, cheap edition, crammed with\r\npictures, small, I admit, and very inaccurate, but still delightful.\r\nHere were the crow, the fox, the wolf, the magpie, the frog, the rabbit,\r\nthe ass, the dog, the cat: all persons of my acquaintance. The glorious\r\nbook was immensely to my taste, with its skimpy illustrations on which\r\nthe animal walked and talked. As to understanding what it said, that\r\nwas another story! Never mind, my lad! Put together syllables that say\r\nnothing to you as yet; they will speak to you later and La Fontaine will\r\nalways remain your friend.\r\n\r\nI come to the time when I was ten years old and at Rodez College. My\r\nfunctions as a serving boy in the chapel entitled me to free instruction\r\nas a day boarder. There were four of us in white surplices and red\r\nskull-caps and cassocks. I was the youngest of the party and did little\r\nmore than walk on. I counted as a unit; and that was about all, for I\r\nwas never certain when to ring the bell or move the missal. I was all\r\nof a tremble when we gathered two on this side and two on that, with\r\ngenuflection's, in the middle of the sanctuary, to intone the Domine,\r\nsalvum fac regern at the end of mass. Let me make a confession:\r\ntongue-tied with shyness, I used to leave it to the others.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I was well thought of, for, in the school, I cut a good\r\nfigure in composition and translation. In that classical atmosphere,\r\nthere was talk of Procas, King of Alba, and of his two sons, Numitor and\r\nAmulius. We heard of Cynoegirus, the strong jawed man, who, having\r\nlost his two hands in battle, seized and held a Persian galley with\r\nhis teeth, and of Cadmus the Phoenician, who sowed a dragon's teeth as\r\nthough they were beans and gathered his harvest in the shape of a host\r\nof armed men, who killed one another as they rose up from the ground.\r\nThe only one who survived the slaughter was one as tough as leather,\r\npresumably the son of the big back grinder.\r\n\r\nHad they talked to me about the man in the moon, I could not have been\r\nmore startled. I made up for it with my animals, which I was far from\r\nforgetting amid this phantasmagoria of heroes and demigods. While\r\nhonoring the exploits of Cadmus and Cynoegirus, I hardly ever failed, on\r\nSundays and Thursdays [the weekly half-holiday in French schools], to go\r\nand see if the cowslip or the yellow daffodil was making its appearance\r\nin the meadows, if the Linnet was hatching on the juniper bushes, if the\r\nCockchafers were plopping down from the wind shaken poplars. Thus was\r\nthe sacred spark kept aglow, ever brighter than before.\r\n\r\nBy easy stages, I came to Virgil and was very much smitten with\r\nMeliboeus, Corydon, Menalcas, Damoetas and the rest of them. The\r\nscandals of the ancient shepherds fortunately passed unnoticed; and\r\nwithin the frame in which the characters moved were exquisite details\r\nconcerning the bee, the cicada, the turtle dove, the crow, the nanny\r\ngoat and the golden broom. A veritable delight were these stories of\r\nthe fields, sung in sonorous verse; and the Latin poet left a lasting\r\nimpression on my classical recollections.\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly, goodbye to my studies, goodbye to Tityrus and Menalcas.\r\nIll luck is swooping down on us, relentlessly. Hunger threatens us\r\nat home. And now, boy, put your trust in God; run about and earn your\r\npenn'orth of potatoes as best you can. Life is about to become a hideous\r\ninferno. Let us pass quickly over this phase. Amid this lamentable\r\nchaos, my love for the insect ought to have gone under. Not at all. It\r\nwould have survived the raft of the Medusa. I still remember a certain\r\npine cockchafer met for the first time. The plumes on her antennae, her\r\npretty pattern of white spots on a dark brown ground were as a ray of\r\nsunshine in the gloomy wretchedness of the day.\r\n\r\nTo cut a long story short: good fortune, which never abandons the brave,\r\nbrought me to the primary normal school at Vaucluse where I was assured\r\nfood: dried chestnuts and chickpeas. The principal, a man of broad\r\nviews, soon came to trust his new assistant. He left me practically a\r\nfree hand, so long as I satisfied the school curriculum, which was very\r\nmodest in those days. Possessing a smattering of Latin and grammar, I\r\nwas a little ahead of my fellow pupils. I took advantage of this to\r\nget some order into my vague knowledge of plants and animals. While a\r\ndictation lesson was being corrected around me, with generous assistance\r\nfrom the dictionary, I would examine, in the recesses of my desk, the\r\noleander's fruit, the snapdragon's seed vessel, the wasp's sting and the\r\nground beetle's wing-case.\r\n\r\nWith this foretaste of natural science, picked up haphazard and by\r\nstealth, I left school more deeply in love than ever with insects and\r\nflowers. And yet I had to give it all up. That wider education, which\r\nwould have to be my source of livelihood in the future, demanded this\r\nimperiously. What was I to take in hand to raise me above the primary\r\nschool, whose staff could barely earn their bread in those days? Natural\r\nhistory could not bring me anywhere. The educational system of the time\r\nkept it at a distance, as unworthy of association with Latin and Greek.\r\nMathematics remained, with its very simple equipment: a blackboard, a\r\nbit of chalk and a few books.\r\n\r\nSo I flung myself with might and main into conic sections and the\r\ncalculus: a hard battle, if ever there was one, without guides or\r\ncounselors, face to face for days on end with the abstruse problem which\r\nmy stubborn thinking at last stripped of its mysteries. Next came\r\nthe physical sciences, studied in the same manner, with an impossible\r\nlaboratory, the work of my own hands.\r\n\r\nThe reader can imagine the fate of my favorite branch of science in\r\nthis fierce struggle. At the faintest sign of revolt, I lectured myself\r\nseverely, lest I should let myself be seduced by some new grass, some\r\nunknown Beetle. I did violence to my feelings. My natural history books\r\nwere sentenced to oblivion, relegated to the bottom of a trunk.\r\n\r\nAnd so, in the end, I am sent to teach physics and chemistry at Ajaccio\r\nCollege. This time, the temptation is too much for me. The sea, with its\r\nwonders, the beach, whereon the tide casts such beautiful shells,\r\nthe maquis of myrtles, arbutus and mastic trees: all this paradise of\r\ngorgeous nature has too much on its side in the struggle with the sine\r\nand the cosine. I succumb. My leisure time is divided into two parts.\r\nOne, the larger, is allotted to mathematics, the foundation of my\r\nacademical future, as planned by myself; the other is spent, with much\r\nmisgiving, in botanizing and looking for the treasures of the sea. What\r\na country and what magnificent studies to be made, if, unobsessed by x\r\nand y, I had devoted myself wholeheartedly to my inclinations!\r\n\r\nWe are the wisp of straw, the plaything of the winds. We think that we\r\nare making for a goal deliberately chosen; destiny drives us towards\r\nanother. Mathematics, the exaggerated preoccupation of my youth, did\r\nme hardly any service; and animals, which I avoided as much as ever I\r\ncould, are the consolation of my old age. Nevertheless, I bear no\r\ngrudge against the sine and the cosine, which I continue to hold in high\r\nesteem. They cost me many a pallid hour at one time, but they always\r\nafforded me some first rate entertainment: they still do so, when my\r\nhead lies tossing sleeplessly on its pillow.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Ajaccio received the visit of a famous Avignon botanist,\r\nRequien by name, who, with a box crammed with paper under his arm, had\r\nlong been botanizing all over Corsica, pressing and drying specimens\r\nand distributing them to his friends. We soon became acquainted. I\r\naccompanied him in my free time on his explorations and never did the\r\nmaster have a more attentive disciple. To tell the truth, Requien was\r\nnot a man of learning so much as an enthusiastic collector. Very few\r\nwould have felt capable of competing with him when it came to giving the\r\nname or the geographical distribution of a plant. A blade of grass, a\r\npad of moss, a scab of lichen, a thread of seaweed: he knew them all.\r\nThe scientific name flashed across his mind at once. What an unerring\r\nmemory, what a genius for classification amid the enormous mass of\r\nthings observed! I stood aghast at it. I owe much to Requien in the\r\ndomain of botany. Had death spared him longer, I should doubtless\r\nhave owed more to him, for his was a generous heart, ever open to the\r\ntroubles of novices.\r\n\r\nIn the following year, I met Moquin-Tandon, with whom, thanks\r\nto Requien, I had already exchanged a few letters on botany. The\r\nillustrious Toulouse professor came to study on the spot the flora which\r\nhe proposed to describe systematically. When he arrived, all the hotel\r\nbedrooms were reserved for the members of the general council which had\r\nbeen summoned; and I offered him board and lodging: a shakedown in a\r\nroom overlooking the sea; fare consisting of lampreys, turbot and sea\r\nurchins: common enough dishes in that land of Cockayne, but possessing\r\nno small attraction for the naturalist, because of their novelty. My\r\ncordial proposal tempted him; he yielded to my blandishments; and there\r\nwe were for a fortnight chatting at table de omni re scibili after the\r\nbotanical excursion was over.\r\n\r\nWith Moquin-Tandon, new vistas opened before me. Here it was no longer\r\nthe case of a nomenclator with an infallible memory: he was a naturalist\r\nwith far-reaching ideas, a philosopher who soared above petty details to\r\ncomprehensive views of life, a writer, a poet who knew how to clothe the\r\nnaked truth in the magic mantle of the glowing word. Never again shall\r\nI sit at an intellectual feast like that: 'Leave your mathematics,' he\r\nsaid. 'No one will take the least interest in your formula. Get to the\r\nbeast, the plant; and, if, as I believe, the fever burns in your veins,\r\nyou will find men to listen to you.'\r\n\r\nWe made an expedition to the center of the island, to Monte Renoso,\r\nwith which I was already familiar. I made the scientist pick the hoary\r\neverlasting (Helichrysum frigidum), which makes a wonderful patch of\r\nsilver; the many-headed thrift, or mouflon grass (Armeria multiceps),\r\nwhich the Corsicans call erba muorone; the downy marguerite\r\n(Leucanthemum tomosum), which, clad in wadding, shivers amid the\r\nsnows; and many other rarities dear to the botanist. Moquin-Tandon was\r\njubilant. I, on my side, was much more attracted and overcome by his\r\nwords and his enthusiasm than by the hoary everlasting. When we came\r\ndown from the cold mountaintop, my mind was made up: mathematics would\r\nbe abandoned.\r\n\r\nOn the day before his departure, he said to me: 'You interest yourself\r\nin shells. That is something, but it is not enough. You must look into\r\nthe animal itself. I will show you how it's done.'\r\n\r\nAnd, taking a sharp pair of scissors from the family work-basket and\r\na couple of needles stuck into a bit of vine shoot which served as a\r\nmakeshift handle, he showed me the anatomy of a snail in a soup plate\r\nfilled with water. Gradually he explained and sketched the organs which\r\nhe spread before my eyes. This was the only, never-to-be-forgotten\r\nlesson in natural history that I ever received in my life.\r\n\r\nIt is time to conclude. I was cross-examining myself, being unable to\r\ncross-examine the silent Beetle. As far as it is possible to read within\r\nmyself, I answer as follows: 'From early childhood, from the moment\r\nof my first mental awakening, I have felt drawn towards the things of\r\nnature, or, to return to our catchword, I have the gift, the bump of\r\nobservation.'\r\n\r\nAfter the details which I have already given about my ancestors, it\r\nwould be ridiculous to look to heredity for an explanation of the fact.\r\nNor would any one venture to suggest the words or example of my masters.\r\nOf scientific education, the fruit of college training, I had none\r\nwhatever. I never set foot in a lecture hall except to undergo the\r\nordeal of examinations. Without masters, without guides, often without\r\nbooks, in spite of poverty, that terrible extinguisher, I went ahead,\r\npersisted, facing my difficulties, until the indomitable bump ended by\r\nshedding its scanty contents. Yes, they were very scanty, yet possibly\r\nof some value, if circumstances had come to their assistance. I was a\r\nborn animalist. Why and how? No reply.\r\n\r\nWe thus have, all of us, in different directions and in a greater\r\nor lesser degree, characteristics that brand us with a special mark,\r\ncharacteristics of an unfathomable origin. They exist because they\r\nexist; and that is all that any one can say. The gift is not handed\r\ndown: the man of talent has a fool for a son. Nor is it acquired; but it\r\nis improved by practice. He who has not the germ of it in his veins will\r\nnever possess it, in spite of all the pains of a hothouse education.\r\n\r\nThat to which we give the name of instinct when speaking of animals is\r\nsomething similar to genius. It is, in both cases, a peak that rises\r\nabove the ordinary level. But instinct is handed down, unchanged and\r\nundiminished, throughout the sequence of a species; it is permanent\r\nand general and in this it differs greatly from genius, which is not\r\ntransmissible and changes in different cases. Instinct is the inviolable\r\nheritage of the family and falls to one and all, without distinction.\r\nHere the difference ends. Independent of similarity of structure, it\r\nbreaks out like genius, here or elsewhere, for no perceptible reason.\r\nNothing causes it to be foreseen, nothing in the organization explains\r\nit. If cross-examined on this point, the Dung beetles and the rest, each\r\nwith his own peculiar talent, would answer, were we able to understand\r\nthem: 'Instinct is the animal's genius.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. THE POND\r\n\r\nThe pond, the delight of my early childhood, is still a sight whereof my\r\nold eyes never tire. What animation in that verdant world! On the warm\r\nmud of the edges, the frog's little tadpole basks and frisks in its\r\nblack legions; down in the water, the orange-bellied newt steers his\r\nway slowly with the broad rudder of his flat tail; among the reeds are\r\nstationed the flotillas of the caddis worms, half protruding from their\r\ntubes, which are now a tiny bit of stick and again a turret of little\r\nshells.\r\n\r\nIn the deep places, the water beetle dives, carrying with him his\r\nreserves of breath: an air bubble at the tip of the wing cases and,\r\nunder the chest, a film of gas that gleams like a silver breastplate;\r\non the surface, the ballet of those shimmering pearls, the whirligigs,\r\nturns and twists about; hard by there skims the unsubmersible troop of\r\nthe pond skaters, who glide along with side strokes similar to those\r\nwhich the cobbler makes when sewing.\r\n\r\nHere are the water boatmen, who swim on their backs with two oars spread\r\ncross-wise, and the flat water scorpions; here, squalidly clad in mud,\r\nis the grub of the largest of our dragonflies, so curious because of its\r\nmanner of progression: it fills its hinder parts, a yawning funnel, with\r\nwater, spurts it out again and advances just so far as the recoil of its\r\nhydraulic cannon.\r\n\r\nThe mollusks abound, a peaceful tribe. At the bottom, the plump river\r\nsnails discreetly raise their lid, opening ever so little the shutters\r\nof their dwelling; on the level of the water, in the glades of the\r\naquatic garden, the pond snails--Physa, Limnaea and Planorbis--take\r\nthe air. Dark leeches writhe upon their prey, a chunk of earthworm;\r\nthousands of tiny, reddish grubs, future mosquitoes, go spinning around\r\nand twist and curve like so many graceful dolphins.\r\n\r\nYes, a stagnant pool, though but a few feet wide, hatched by the sun, is\r\nan immense world, an inexhaustible mine of observation to the studious\r\nman and a marvel to the child who, tired of his paper boat, diverts his\r\neyes and thoughts a little with what is happening in the water. Let me\r\ntell what I remember of my first pond, at a time when ideas began to\r\ndawn in my seven-year-old brain.\r\n\r\nHow shall a man earn his living in my poor native village, with its\r\ninclement weather and its niggardly soil? The owner of a few acres of\r\ngrazing land rears sheep. In the best parts, he scrapes the soil with\r\nthe swing plow; he flattens it into terraces banked by walls of broken\r\nstones. Pannierfuls of dung are carried up on donkey-back from the\r\ncowshed. Then, in due season, comes the excellent potato, which, boiled\r\nand served hot in a basket of plaited straw, is the chief stand-by in\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nShould the crop exceed the needs of the household, the surplus goes to\r\nfeed a pig, that precious beast, a treasure of bacon and ham. The ewes\r\nsupply butter and curds; the garden boasts cabbages, turnips and even a\r\nfew hives in a sheltered corner. With wealth like that one can look fate\r\nin the face.\r\n\r\nBut we, we have nothing, nothing but the little house inherited by my\r\nmother and its adjoining patch of garden. The meager resources of the\r\nfamily are coming to an end. It is time to see to it and that quickly.\r\nWhat is to be done? That is the stern question which father and mother\r\nsat debating one evening.\r\n\r\nHop-o'-my-Thumb, hiding under the woodcutter's stool, listened to his\r\nparents overcome by want. I also, pretending to sleep, with my elbows on\r\nthe table, listen not to blood curdling designs, but to grand plans that\r\nset my heart rejoicing. This is how the matter stands: at the bottom of\r\nthe village, near the church, at the spot where the water of the large\r\nroofed spring escapes from its underground weir and joins the brook in\r\nthe valley, an enterprising man, back from the war, has set up a small\r\ntallow factory. He sells the scrapings of his pans, the burnt fat,\r\nreeking of candle grease, at a low price. He proclaims these wares to be\r\nexcellent for fattening ducks.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose we bred some ducks,\" says mother. \"They sell very well in town.\r\nHenri would mind them and take them down to the brook.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" says father, \"let's breed some ducks. There may be\r\ndifficulties in the way; but we'll have a try.\"\r\n\r\nThat night, I had dreams of paradise: I was with my ducklings, clad in\r\ntheir yellow suits; I took them to the pond, I watched them have their\r\nbath, I brought them back again, carrying the more tired ones in a\r\nbasket.\r\n\r\nA month or two after, the little birds of my dreams were a reality.\r\nThere were twenty-four of them. They had been hatched by two hens, of\r\nwhom one, the big, black one, was an inmate of the house, while the\r\nother was borrowed from a neighbor.\r\n\r\nTo bring them up, the former is sufficient, so careful is she of her\r\nadopted family. At first, everything goes perfectly: a tub with two\r\nfingers' depth of water serves as a pond. On sunny days, the ducklings\r\nbathe in it under the anxious eye of the hen.\r\n\r\nA fortnight later, the tub is no longer enough. It contains neither\r\ncresses crammed with tiny shellfish nor worms and tadpoles, dainty\r\nmorsels both. The time has come for dives and hunts amid the tangle of\r\nthe water weeds; and for us the day of trouble has also come. True, the\r\nmiller, down by the brook, has fine ducks, easy and cheap to bring up;\r\nthe tallow smelter, who has extolled his burnt fat so loudly, has some\r\nas well, for he has the advantage of the waste water from the spring at\r\nthe bottom of the village; but how are we, right up there, at the top,\r\nto procure aquatic sports for our broods? In summer, we have hardly\r\nwater to drink!\r\n\r\nNear the house, in a freestone recess, a scanty source trickles into a\r\nbasin made in the rock.. Four or five families have, like ourselves,\r\nto draw their water there with copper pails. By the time that the\r\nschoolmaster's donkey has slaked her thirst and the neighbors have\r\ntaken their provision for the day, the basin is dry. We have to wait for\r\nfour-and-twenty hours for it to fill. No, this is not the hole in which\r\nthe ducks would delight nor indeed in which they would be tolerated.\r\n\r\nThere remains the brook. To go down to it with the troop of ducklings is\r\nfraught with danger. On the way through the village, we might meet cats,\r\nbold ravishers of small poultry; some surly mongrel might frighten and\r\nscatter the little band; and it would be a hard puzzle to collect it in\r\nits entirety. We must avoid the traffic and take refuge in peaceful and\r\nsequestered spots.\r\n\r\nOn the hills, the path that climbs behind the chateau soon takes a\r\nsudden turn and widens into a small plain beside the meadows. It skirts\r\na rocky slope whence trickles, level with the ground, a streamlet,\r\nforming a pond of some size. Here profound solitude reigns all day long.\r\nThe ducklings will be well off; and the journey can be made in peace by\r\na deserted footpath.\r\n\r\nYou, little man, shall take them to that delectable spot. What a day\r\nit was that marked my first appearance as a herdsman of ducks! Why\r\nmust there be a jar to the even tenor of such joys? The too frequent\r\nencounter of my tender skin with the hard ground had given me a large\r\nand painful blister on the heel. Had I wanted to put on the shoes stowed\r\naway in the cupboard for Sundays and holidays, I could not. There was\r\nnothing for it but to go barefoot over the broken stones, dragging my\r\nleg and carrying high the injured heel.\r\n\r\nLet us make a start, hobbling along, switch in hand, behind the ducks.\r\nThey too, poor little things, have sensitive soles to their feet; they\r\nlimp, they quack with fatigue. They would refuse to go any farther if I\r\ndid not, from time to time, call a halt under the shelter of an ash.\r\n\r\nWe are there at last. The place could not be better for my birdlets;\r\nshallow, tepid water, interspersed with muddy knolls and green eyots.\r\nThe diversions of the bath begin forthwith. The ducklings clap their\r\nbeaks and rummage here, there and everywhere; they sift each mouthful,\r\nrejecting the clear water and retaining the good bits. In the deeper\r\nparts, they point their sterns into the air and stick their heads under\r\nwater. They are happy; and it is a blessed thing to see them at work. We\r\nwill let them be. It is my turn to enjoy the pond.\r\n\r\nWhat is this? On the mud lie some loose, knotted, soot-colored cords.\r\nOne could take them for threads of wool like those which you pull out of\r\nan old ravelly stocking. Can some shepherdess, knitting a black sock and\r\nfinding her work turn out badly, have begun all over again and, in her\r\nimpatience, have thrown down the wool with all the dropped stitches? It\r\nreally looks like it.\r\n\r\nI take up one of those cords in my hand. It is sticky and extremely\r\nslack; the thing slips through the fingers before they can catch hold of\r\nit. A few of the knots burst and shed their contents. What comes out is\r\na black globule, the size of a pin's head, followed by a flat tail. I\r\nrecognize, on a very small scale, a familiar object: the tadpole, the\r\nfrog's baby. I have seen enough. Let us leave the knotted cords alone.\r\n\r\nThe next creatures please me better. They spin round on the surface of\r\nthe water and their black backs gleam in the sun. If I lift a hand to\r\nseize them, that moment they disappear, I know not where. It's a pity: I\r\nshould have much liked to see them closer and to make them wriggle in a\r\nlittle bowl which I should have put ready for them.\r\n\r\nLet us look at the bottom of the water, pulling aside those bunches of\r\ngreen string whence beads of air are rising and gathering into foam.\r\nThere is something of everything underneath. I see pretty shells with\r\ncompact whorls, flat as beans; I notice little worms carrying tufts and\r\nfeathers; I make out some with flabby fins constantly flapping on their\r\nbacks. What are they all doing there? What are their names? I do not\r\nknow. And I stare at them for ever so long, held by the incomprehensible\r\nmystery of the waters.\r\n\r\nAt the place where the pond dribbles into the adjoining field are some\r\nalder trees; and here I make a glorious find. It is a scarab--not a\r\nvery large one, oh no! He is smaller than a cherry-stone, but of an\r\nunutterable blue. The angels in paradise must wear dresses of that\r\ncolor. I put the glorious one inside an empty snail-shell, which I plug\r\nup with a leaf. I shall admire that living jewel at my leisure, when I\r\nget back. Other distractions summon me away.\r\n\r\nThe spring that feeds the pond trickles from the rock, cold and clear.\r\nThe water first collects into a cup, the size of the hollow of one's two\r\nhands, and then runs over in a stream. These falls call for a mill: that\r\ngoes without saying. Two bits of straw, artistically crossed upon\r\nan axis, provide the machinery; some flat stones set on edge afford\r\nsupports. It is a great success: the mill turns admirably. My triumph\r\nwould be complete, could I but share it. For want of other playmates, I\r\ninvite the ducks.\r\n\r\nEverything palls in this poor world of ours, even a mill made of two\r\nstraws. Let us think of something else: let us contrive a dam to hold\r\nback the waters and form a pool. There is no lack of stones for the\r\nbrickwork. I pick the most suitable; I break the larger ones. And, while\r\ncollecting these blocks, suddenly I forget all about the dam which I\r\nmeant to build.\r\n\r\nOn one of the broken stones, in a cavity large enough for me to put my\r\nfist in, something gleams like glass. The hollow is lined with facets\r\ngathered in sixes which flash and glitter in the sun. I have seen\r\nsomething like this in church, on the great saints' days, when the light\r\nof the candles in the big chandelier kindles the stars in its hanging\r\ncrystal.\r\n\r\nWe children, lying, in summer, on the straw of the threshing floor,\r\nhave told one another stories of the treasures which a dragon guards\r\nunderground. Those treasures now return to my mind: the names of\r\nprecious stones ring out uncertainly but gloriously in my memory. I\r\nthink of the king's crown, of the princesses' necklaces. In breaking\r\nstones, can I have found, but on a much richer scale, the thing that\r\nshines quite small in my mother's ring? I want more such.\r\n\r\nThe dragon of the subterranean treasures treats me generously. He gives\r\nme his diamonds in such quantities that soon I possess a heap of broken\r\nstones sparkling with magnificent clusters. He does more: he gives me\r\nhis gold. The trickle of water from the rock falls on a bed of fine sand\r\nwhich it swirls into bubbles. If I bent over towards the light, I see\r\nsomething like gold filings whirling where the fall touches the bottom.\r\nIs it really the famous metal of which twenty-franc pieces, so rare with\r\nus at home, are made? One would think so, from the glitter.\r\n\r\nI take a pinch of sand and place it in my palm. The brilliant particles\r\nare numerous, but so small that I have to pick them up with a straw\r\nmoistened in my mouth. Let us drop this: they are too tiny and too\r\nbothersome to collect. The big, valuable lumps must be farther on,\r\nin the thickness of the rock. We'll come back later; we'll blast the\r\nmountain.\r\n\r\nI break more stones. Oh, what a queer thing has just come loose, all in\r\none piece! It is turned spiral-wise, like certain flat snails that come\r\nout of the cracks of old walls in rainy weather. With its gnarled sides,\r\nit looks like a little ram's horn. Shell or horn, it is very curious.\r\nHow do things like that find their way into the stone?\r\n\r\nTreasures and curiosities make my pockets bulge with pebbles. It is\r\nlate and the little ducklings have had all they want to eat. Come\r\nalong, youngsters, let's go home. My blistered heel is forgotten in\r\nmy excitement. The walk back is a delight. A voice sings in my ear,\r\nan untranslatable voice, softer than any language and bewildering as a\r\ndream. It speaks to me for the first time of the mysteries of the pond;\r\nit glorifies the heavenly insect which I hear moving in the empty snail\r\nshell, its temporary cage; it whispers the secrets of the rock, the gold\r\nfilings, the faceted jewels, the ram's horn turned to stone.\r\n\r\nPoor simpleton, smother your joy! I arrive. My parents catch sight of\r\nmy bulging pockets, with their disgraceful load of stones. The cloth has\r\ngiven way under the rough and heavy burden.\r\n\r\n\"You rascal!\" says father, at sight of the damage. \"I send you to mind\r\nthe ducks and you amuse yourself picking up stones, as though there\r\nweren't enough of them all round the house! Make haste and throw them\r\naway!\"\r\n\r\nBroken hearted, I obey. Diamonds, gold dust, petrified ram's horn,\r\nheavenly beetle are all flung on a rubbish heap outside the door.\r\n\r\nMother bewails her lot: \"A nice thing, bringing up children to see them\r\nturn out so badly! You'll bring me to my grave. Green stuff I don't\r\nmind: it does for the rabbits. But stones, which ruin your pockets;\r\npoisonous animals, which'll sting your hand: what good are they to you,\r\nsilly? There's no doubt about it: some one has thrown a spell over you!\"\r\n\r\nYes, my poor mother, you were right, in your simplicity: a spell had\r\nbeen cast upon me; I admit it today. When it is hard enough to earn\r\none's bit of bread, does not improving one's mind but render one more\r\nmeet for suffering? Of what avail is the torment of learning to the\r\nderelicts of life?\r\n\r\nA deal better off am I, at this late hour, dogged by poverty and knowing\r\nthat the diamonds of the duck pool were rock crystal, the gold dust\r\nmica, the stone horn an Ammonite and the sky-blue beetle a Hoplia! We\r\npoor men would do better to mistrust the joys of knowledge: let us dig\r\nour furrow in the fields of the commonplace, flee the temptations of the\r\npond, mind our ducks and leave to others, more favored by fortune, the\r\njob of explaining the world's mechanism, if the spirit moves them.\r\n\r\nAnd yet no! Alone among living creatures, man has the thirst for\r\nknowledge; he alone pries into the mysteries of things. The least among\r\nus will utter his whys and his wherefores, a fine pain unknown to\r\nthe brute beast. If these questionings come from us with greater\r\npersistence, with a more imperious authority, if they divert us from\r\nthe quest of lucre, life's only object in the eyes of most men, does it\r\nbecome us to complain? Let us be careful not to do so, for that would be\r\ndenying the best of all our gifts.\r\n\r\nLet us strive, on the contrary, within the measure of our capacity,\r\nto force a gleam of light from the vast unknown; let us examine and\r\nquestion and, here and there, wrest a few shreds of truth. We shall sink\r\nunder the task; in the present ill ordered state of society, we shall\r\nend, perhaps, in the workhouse. Let us go ahead for all that: our\r\nconsolation shall be that we have increased by one atom the general mass\r\nof knowledge, the incomparable treasure of mankind.\r\n\r\nAs this modest lot has fallen to me, I will return to the pond,\r\nnotwithstanding the wise admonitions and the bitter tears which I once\r\nowed to it. I will return to the pond, but not to that of the small\r\nducks, the pond aflower with illusions: those ponds do not occur twice\r\nin a lifetime. For luck like that, you must be in all the new glory of\r\nyour first breeches and your first ideas.\r\n\r\nMany another have I come upon since that distant time, ponds very much\r\nricher and, moreover, explored with the ripened eye of experience.\r\nEnthusiastically I searched them with the net, stirred up their mud,\r\nransacked their trailing weeds. None in my memories comes up to the\r\nfirst, magnified in its delights and mortifications by the marvelous\r\nperspective of the years.\r\n\r\nNor would any of them suit my plans of today. Their world is too vast. I\r\nshould lose myself in their immensities, where life swarms freely in the\r\nsun. Like the ocean, they are infinite in their fruitfulness. And then\r\nany assiduous watching, undisturbed by passers by, is an impossibility\r\non the public way. What I want is a pond on an extremely reduced\r\nscale, sparingly stocked in my own fashion an artificial pond standing\r\npermanently on my study table.\r\n\r\nA louis has been overlooked in a corner of the drawer. I can spend it\r\nwithout seriously jeopardizing the domestic balance. Let me make this\r\ngift to science, who, I fear, will be none too much obliged to me. A\r\ngorgeous equipment may be all very well for laboratories wherein the\r\ncells and fibers of the dead are consulted at great expense; but such\r\nmagnificence is of doubtful utility when we have to study the actions\r\nof the living. It is the humble makeshift, of no value, that stumbles on\r\nthe secrets of life.\r\n\r\nWhat did the best results of my studies of instinct cost me? Nothing\r\nbut time and, above all, patience. My extravagant expenditure of\r\ntwenty francs, therefore, will be a risky speculation if devoted to the\r\npurchase of an apparatus of study. It will bring me in nothing in the\r\nway of fresh views, of that I am convinced. However, let us try.\r\n\r\nThe blacksmith makes me the framework of a cage out of a few iron rods.\r\nThe joiner, who is also a glazier on occasion--for, in my village, you\r\nhave to be a Jack-of-all-trades if you would make both ends meet--sets\r\nthe framework on a wooden base and supplies it with a movable board as\r\na lid; he fixes thick panes of glass in the four sides. Behold the\r\napparatus, complete, with a bottom of tarred sheet iron and a trap to\r\nlet the water out.\r\n\r\nThe makers express themselves satisfied with their work, a singular\r\nnovelty in their respective shops, where many an inquisitive caller has\r\nwondered what use I intend to make of my little glass trough. The thing\r\ncreates a certain stir. Some insist that it is meant to hold my supplies\r\nof oil and to take the place of the receptacle in general use in\r\nour parts, the urn dug out of a block of stone. What would those\r\nutilitarians have thought of my crazy mind, had they known that my\r\ncostly gear would merely serve to let me watch some wretched animals\r\nkicking about in the water!\r\n\r\nSmith and glazier are content with their work. I myself am pleased. For\r\nall its rustic air, the apparatus does not lack elegance. It looks very\r\nwell, standing on a little table in front of a window visited by the\r\nsun for the greater part of the day. Its holding capacity is some ten\r\nor eleven gallons. What shall we call it? An aquarium? No, that would be\r\ntoo pretentious and would, very unjustly, suggest the aquatic toy filled\r\nwith rock work, waterfalls and goldfish beloved of the dwellers in\r\nsuburbia. Let us preserve the gravity of serious things and not treat my\r\nlearned trough as though it were a drawing room futility. We will call\r\nit the glass pond.\r\n\r\nI furnish it with a heap of those limy incrustations wherewith certain\r\nsprings in the neighborhood cover the dead clump of rushes. It is light,\r\nfull of holes and gives a faint suggestion of a coral reef. Moreover,\r\nit is covered with a short, green, velvety moss, a downy sward of\r\ninfinitesimal pond weed. I count on this modest vegetation to keep the\r\nwater in a reasonably wholesome state, without driving me to frequent\r\nrenewals which would disturb the work of my colonies. Sanitation and\r\nquiet are the first conditions of success. Now the stocked pond will\r\nnot be long in filling itself with gases unfit to breathe, with putrid\r\neffluvia and other animal refuse; it will become a sink in which life\r\nwill have killed life. Those dregs must disappear as soon as they are\r\nformed, must be burnt and purified; and from their oxidized ruins there\r\nmust even rise a perfect life-giving gas, so that the water may retain\r\nan unchangeable store of the breathable element. The plant effects this\r\npurification in its sewage farm of green cells.\r\n\r\nWhen the sun beats upon the glass pond, the work of the water weeds is\r\na sight to behold. The green-carpeted reef is lit up with an infinity\r\nof scintillating points and assumes the appearance of a fairy lawn\r\nof velvet, studded with thousands of diamond pin's heads. From this\r\nexquisite jewelry pearls break loose continuously and are at once\r\nreplaced by others in the generating casket; slowly they rise, like tiny\r\nglobes of light. They spread on every side. It is a constant display of\r\nfireworks in the depths of the water.\r\n\r\nChemistry tells us that, thanks to its green matter and the stimulus of\r\nthe sun's rays, the weeds decompose the carbonic acid gas wherewith\r\nthe water is impregnated by the breathing of its inhabitants and the\r\ncorruption of the organic refuse; it retains the carbon, which is\r\nwrought into fresh tissues; it exhales the oxygen in tiny bubbles. These\r\npartly dissolve in the water and partly reach the surface, where their\r\nfroth supplies the atmosphere with an excess of breathable gas. The\r\ndissolved portion keeps the colonists of the pond alive and causes the\r\nunhealthy products to be oxidized and disappear.\r\n\r\nOld hand though I be, I take an interest in this trite marvel of a\r\nbundle of weeds perpetuating hygienic principles in a stagnant pool;\r\nI look with a delighted eye upon the inexhaustible spray of spreading\r\nbubbles; I see in imagination the prehistoric times when seaweed, the\r\nfirst-born of plants, produced the first atmosphere for living things\r\nto breathe at the time when the silt of the continents was beginning to\r\nemerge. What I see before my eyes, between the glass panes of my trough,\r\ntells me the story of the planet surrounding itself with pure air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. THE CADDIS WORM\r\n\r\nWhom shall I lodge in my glass trough, kept permanently wholesome by\r\nthe action of the water weeds? I shall keep caddis worms, those expert\r\ndressers. Few of the self-clothing insects surpass them in ingenious\r\nattire. The ponds in my neighborhood supply me with five or six species,\r\neach possessing an art of its own. Today, but one of these shall receive\r\nhistorical honors.\r\n\r\nI obtain it from the muddy bottomed, stagnant pools crammed with small\r\nreeds. As far as one can judge from the habitation merely, it should be,\r\naccording to the specialists, Limnophilus flavicornis, whose work has\r\nearned for the whole corporation the pretty name of Phryganea, a Greek\r\nterm meaning a bit of wood, a stick. In a no less expressive fashion,\r\nthe Provencal peasant calls it lou portofais, lou porto-caneu. This is\r\nthe little grub that carries through the still waters a faggot of tiny\r\nfragments fallen from the reeds.\r\n\r\nIts sheath, a travelling house, is a composite and barbaric piece of\r\nwork, a megalithic pile wherein art, retires in favor of amorphous\r\nstrength. The materials are many and sundry, so much so that we might\r\nimagine that we had the work of dissimilar builders before our eyes, if\r\nfrequent transitions did not tell us the contrary.\r\n\r\nWith the young ones, the novices, it starts with a sort of deep basket\r\nin rustic wicker-work. The twigs employed present nearly always the same\r\ncharacteristics and are none other than bits of small, stiff roots, long\r\nsteeped and peeled under water. The grub that has made a find of these\r\nfibers saws them with its mandibles and cuts them into little straight\r\nsticks, which it fixes one by one to the edge of its basket, always\r\ncrosswise, perpendicular to the axis of the work.\r\n\r\nPicture a circle surrounded by a bristling mass of tangents, or rather a\r\npolygon with its sides extended in all directions. On this assemblage\r\nof straight lines we place repeated layers of others, without troubling\r\nabout similarity of position, thus obtaining a sort of ragged fascine,\r\nwhose sticks project on every side. Such is the bastion of the child\r\ngrub, an excellent system of defense, with its continuous pile of\r\nspikes, but difficult to steer through the tangle of aquatic plants.\r\n\r\nSooner or later, the worm forsakes this kind of caltrop which catches on\r\nto everything. It was a basket maker, it now turns carpenter; it builds\r\nwith little beams and joists--that is to say, with round bits of\r\nwood, browned by the water, often as wide as a thick straw and a\r\nfinger's-breadth long, more or less--taking them as chance supplies\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, there is something of everything in this rag bag: bits of\r\nstubble, fag ends of rushes, scraps of plants, fragments of some tiny\r\ntwig or other, chips of wood, shreds of bark, largish grains, especially\r\nthe seeds of the yellow iris, which were red when they fell from their\r\ncapsules and are now black as jet.\r\n\r\nThe heterogeneous collection is piled up anyhow. Some pieces are fixed\r\nlengthwise, others across, others aslant. There are angles in this\r\ndirection and angles in the other, resulting in sharp little turns and\r\ntwists; the big is mixed with the little, the correct rubs\r\nshoulders with the shapeless. It is not an edifice, it is a frenzied\r\nconglomeration. Sometimes, a fine disorder is an effect of art. This\r\nis not so here: the work of the Caddis worm is not a masterpiece worth\r\nsigning.\r\n\r\nAnd this mad heaping up follows straight upon the regular basket work\r\nof the start. The young grub's fascine did not lack a certain elegance,\r\nwith its dainty laths, all stacked crosswise, methodically; and, lo\r\nand behold, the builder, grown larger, more experienced and, one would\r\nthink, more skilful, abandons the orderly plan to adopt another which\r\nis wild and incoherent! There is no transition stage between the two\r\nsystems. The extravagant pile rises abruptly from the original basket.\r\nBut that we often find the two kinds of work placed one above the other,\r\nwe would not dare ascribe to them a common origin. The fact of their\r\nbeing joined together is the only thing that makes them one, in spite of\r\nthe incongruity.\r\n\r\nBut the two storeys do not last indefinitely. When the worm has grown\r\nslightly and is housed to its satisfaction in a heap of joists, it\r\nabandons the basket of its childhood, which has become too narrow and is\r\nnow a troublesome burden. It cuts through its sheath, lops off and lets\r\ngo the stern, the original work. When moving to a higher and roomier\r\nflat, it understands how to lighten its portable house by breaking off\r\na part of it. All that remains is the upper floor, which is enlarged\r\nat the aperture, as and when required, by the same architecture of\r\ndisordered beams.\r\n\r\nSide by side with these cases, which are mere ugly faggots, we find\r\nothers just as often of exquisite beauty and composed entirely of tiny\r\nshells. Do they come from the same workshop? It takes very convincing\r\nproofs to make us believe this. Here is order with its charm, there\r\ndisorder with its hideousness; on the one hand a dainty mosaic of\r\nshells, on the other a clumsy heap of sticks. And yet it is all produced\r\nby the same laborer.\r\n\r\nProofs abound. On some case which offends the eye with the want of\r\narrangement in its bits of wood, patches are apt to appear which are\r\nquite regular and made of shells; in the same way, it is not unusual to\r\nsee a horrid tangle of joists braced to a masterpiece of shell work.\r\nOne feels a certain annoyance at seeing the pretty sheath so barbarously\r\nspoilt.\r\n\r\nThis mixed construction tells us that the rustic stacker of wooden beams\r\nexcels, when occasion offers, in making elegant shell pavements and that\r\nit practices rough carpentry and delicate mosaic work indifferently.\r\nIn the latter instance, the scabbard is made, above all, of Planorbes,\r\nselected among the smaller of these pond snails and laid flat. Without\r\nbeing scrupulously regular, the work, at its best, does not lack merit.\r\nThe pretty, close-whorled spirals, placed one against the other on the\r\nsame level, have a very pleasing general effect. No pilgrim returning\r\nfrom Santiago de Compostella ever slung handsomer tippet from his\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\nBut only too often the caddis worm dashes ahead, regardless of\r\nproportion. The big is joined to the small, the exaggerated suddenly\r\nstands out, to the great detriment of order. Side by side with tiny\r\nPlanorbes, each at most the size of a lentil, others are fixed as large\r\nas one's fingernail; and these cannot possibly be fitted in correctly.\r\nThey overlap the regular parts and spoil their finish.\r\n\r\nTo crown the disorder, the caddis worm adds to the flat spirals any dead\r\nshell that comes handy, without distinction of species, provided it be\r\nnot excessively large. I notice, in its collection of bric-a-brac, the\r\nPhysa, the Paludina, the Limnaea, the Amber snail [all pond snails] and\r\neven the Pisidium [a bivalve], that little twin-valved casket.\r\n\r\nLand shells, swept into the ditches by the rains after the inmate's\r\ndeath, are accepted quite as readily. In the work made of the Mollusk's\r\ncast-off clothing, I find encrusted the spindle shell of the Clausilium,\r\nthe key shell of the pupa, the spiral of the smaller Helix, the yawning\r\nvolute of the Vitrina, or glass snail, the turret shell of the Bulimus\r\n[all land snails], denizens all of the fields. In short, the caddis worm\r\nbuilds with more or less everything that comes from the plant or\r\nthe dead mollusk. Among the diversified refuse of the pond, the only\r\nmaterials rejected are those of a gravelly nature. Stone and pebble are\r\nexcluded from the building with a care that is very rarely absent. This\r\nis a question of hydrostatics to which we will return presently. For the\r\nmoment, let us try to follow the construction of the scabbard.\r\n\r\nIn a tumbler small enough to allow of easy and precise observation, I\r\ninstall three or four caddis worms, extracted this moment from their\r\nsheaths with every possible precaution. After a number of attempts which\r\nhave at last shown me the right road, I place at their disposal two\r\nkinds of materials, possessing opposite qualities; the supple and the\r\nfirm, the soft and the hard. On the one hand, we have a live aquatic\r\nplant, such as watercress, for instance, or ombrelle d'eau, having\r\nat its base a tufty bunch of fine white roots about as thick as a\r\nhorsehair. In these soft tresses, the caddis worm, which observes a\r\nvegetarian diet, will find at one and the same time the wherewithal to\r\nbuild and eat. On the other hand, we have a little faggot of bits of\r\nwood, very dry, equal in length and each possessing the thickness of\r\na good sized pin. The two sorts of building material lie side by side,\r\nmingling their threads and sticks. The animal can make its choice from\r\nthe lump.\r\n\r\nA few hours later, having recovered from the shock of losing its sheath,\r\nthe caddis worm sets to work to manufacture a new one. It settles across\r\na bunch of tangled rootlets, which are brought together by the builder's\r\nlegs and more or less arranged by the undulating movement of the hinder\r\npart. This gives a kind of incoherent and ill defined suspended belt, a\r\nnarrow hammock with a number of loose catches; for the various bits of\r\nwhich it is made up are respected by the teeth and extended from place\r\nto place beyond the main cords of the roots. Here, without much trouble,\r\nis the support, suitably fixed by natural moorings. A few threads of\r\nsilk, casually distributed, make the frail combination a trifle more\r\nsecure.\r\n\r\nAnd now to the work of building. Supported by the suspended belt, the\r\ncaddis worm stretches itself and thrusts out its middle legs, which,\r\nbeing longer than the others, are the grapnels intended to seize things\r\nat a distance. It meets a bit of root, fastens on to it, climbs above\r\nthe point gripped, as though it were measuring the piece to a requisite\r\nlength, and then, with the fine scissors of its mandibles, cuts the\r\nstring.\r\n\r\nThere is at once a brief recoil, which brings the animal back to the\r\nlevel of the hammock. The bit detached lies across the worm's chest,\r\nheld in its forelegs, which turn it, twist it, wave it about, lay it\r\ndown, lift it up, as though trying for the best position. Those forelegs\r\nmake admirably dexterous arms. Being less long than the other two\r\npairs, they are brought into immediate contact with those primordial\r\nimplements, the mandibles and the spinneret. Their delicate terminal\r\njointing, with a movable and crooked finger, is the caddis worm's\r\nequivalent of our hand. They are the working legs. The second pair,\r\nwhich are exceptionally long, serve to spear distant materials and to\r\ngive the worker a firm footing when measuring a piece and cutting it\r\nwith the pliers. Lastly, the hind legs, of medium length, afford a\r\nsupport when the others are busy.\r\n\r\nThe caddis worm, I was saying, with the piece which it has removed\r\nheld crosswise to its chest, retreats a little way along its suspended\r\nhammock until the spinneret is level with the support furnished by the\r\nclose tangle of rootlets. With a quick movement, it shifts its burden,\r\ngets it as nearly by the middle as it can, so that the two ends stick\r\nout equally on either side, and chooses the spot to place it, whereupon\r\nthe spinneret sets to work at once, while the little fore legs hold the\r\nscrap of root motionless in its transversal position. The soldering\r\nis effected with a touch of silk in the middle of the bit and along a\r\ncertain distance to the right and left, as far as the bending of the\r\nhead permits.\r\n\r\nWithout delay, other sticks are speared in like manner at a distance,\r\ncut off and placed in position. As the immediate neighborhood is\r\nstripped, the material is gathered at a yet greater distance and the\r\ncaddis worm bends even farther from its support, which now holds only\r\nits last few segments. It is a curious gymnastic display, that of this\r\nsoft, hanging spine turning and swaying, while the grapnels feel in\r\nevery direction for a thread.\r\n\r\nAll this labor results in a sort of casing of little white cords.\r\nThe work lacks firmness and regularity. Nevertheless, judging by the\r\nbuilder's methods, I can see that the building would not be devoid\r\nof merit if the materials gave it a better chance. The caddis worm\r\nestimates the size of its pieces very fairly; it cuts them all to nearly\r\nthe same length; it always arranges them crosswise on the margin of the\r\ncase; it fixes them by the middle.\r\n\r\nNor is this all: the manner of working helps the general arrangement\r\nconsiderably. When the bricklayer is building the narrow shaft of a\r\nfactory chimney, he stands in the center of his turret and turns round\r\nand round while gradually laying new rows. The caddis worm acts in the\r\nsame way. It twists round in its sheath; it adopts without inconvenience\r\nwhatever position it pleases, so as to bring its spinneret full face\r\nwith the point to be gummed. There is no straining of the neck to left\r\nor right, no throwing back of the head to reach points behind.\r\nThe animal has constantly before it, within the exact range of its\r\nimplements, the place at which the bit is to be fixed. When the piece\r\nis soldered, the worm turns a little aside, to a length equal to that of\r\nthe last soldering, and here, along an extent which hardly ever varies,\r\nan extent determined by the swing which its head is able to give, it\r\nfixes the next piece.\r\n\r\nThese several conditions ought to result in a geometrically ordered\r\ndwelling, having a regular polygon as an opening. Then how comes it that\r\nthe cylinder of bits of root is so confused, so clumsily fashioned? The\r\nreason is this: the worker possesses talent, but the materials do not\r\nlend themselves to accurate work. The rootlets supply stumps of very\r\nuneven shape and thickness. They include big and small ones, straight\r\nand bent, simple and ramified. To combine all these dissimilar pieces\r\ninto an orderly whole is hardly possible, all the more so as the caddis\r\nworm does not appear to attach very much importance to its cylinder,\r\nwhich is a temporary work, hurriedly constructed to afford a speedy\r\nshelter. Matters are urgent; and very soft fibers, clipped with a bite\r\nof the mandibles, are more quickly gathered and more easily put together\r\nthan joists, which require the patient work of the saw. The inaccurate\r\ncylinder, in short, held in position by numerous guy ropes, is a base\r\nupon which a solid and definite structure will rise before long. Soon,\r\nthe original work will crumble to ruins and disappear, whereas the new\r\none, a permanent structure, will even outlast the owner.\r\n\r\nThe insects reared in a tumbler show yet another method of building the\r\nfirst dwelling. This time, the caddis worm is given a few very leafy\r\nstalks of pond weed (Potamogeton densum) and a bundle of small dry\r\ntwigs. It perches on a leaf, which the nippers of the mandibles cut half\r\nacross. The portion left untouched will act as a lanyard and give the\r\nnecessary steadiness to the early operations.\r\n\r\nFrom an adjoining leaf a section is cut out entirely, an angular and\r\ngood sized piece. There is plenty of material and no need for economy.\r\nThe piece is soldered with silk to the strip which was not wholly cut\r\noff. The result of three or four similar operations is to surround\r\nthe Caddis worm with a conical bag, whose wide mouth is scalloped with\r\npointed and very irregular notches. The work of the nippers continues;\r\nfresh pieces are fixed, from one to another, inside the funnel, not far\r\nfrom the edge, so that the bag lengthens, tapers and ends by wrapping\r\nthe animal in a light and floating drapery.\r\n\r\nThus clad for the time being, either in the fine silk of the pond weed\r\nor in the linsey-woolsey supplied by the roots of the watercress, the\r\ncaddis worm begins to think of building a more solid sheath. The present\r\ncasing will serve as a foundation for the stronger building. But the\r\nnecessary materials are seldom near at hand: you have to go and fetch\r\nthem, you have to move your position, an effort which has been avoided\r\nuntil now. With this object, the caddis worm cuts its moorings, that\r\nis to say, the rootlets which keep the cylinder fixed, or else the\r\nhalf-severed leaf of pond weed on which the cone-shaped bag has come\r\ninto being.\r\n\r\nThe worm is now free. The smallness of the artificial pond, the tumbler,\r\nsoon brings it into touch with what it is seeking. This is a little\r\nfaggot of dry twigs, which I have selected of equal length and of slight\r\nthickness. Displaying greater care than it did when treating the slender\r\nroots, the carpenter measures out the requisite length on the joist. The\r\ndistance to which it has to extend its body in order to reach the point\r\nwhere the break will be made tells it pretty accurately what length of\r\nstick it wants.\r\n\r\nThe piece is patiently sawn off with the mandibles; it is next taken in\r\nthe fore legs and held crosswise below the neck. The backward movement\r\nwhich brings the caddis worm home also brings the bit of twig to the\r\nedge of the tube. Thereupon, the methods employed in working with the\r\nscraps of root are renewed in precisely the same manner. The sticks are\r\nscaffolded to the regulation height, all alike in length, amply soldered\r\nin the middle and free at either end.\r\n\r\nWith the picked materials provided, the carpenter has turned out a work\r\nof some elegance. The joists are all arranged crosswise, because\r\nthis way is the handiest for carrying the sticks and putting them in\r\nposition; they are fixed by the middle, because the two arms that hold\r\nthe stick while the spinneret does its work require an equal grasp\r\non either side; each soldering covers a length which is seen to be\r\npractically invariable, because it is equal to the width described by\r\nthe head in bending first to this side and then to that when the silk\r\nis emitted; the whole assumes a polygonal shape, not far removed from\r\na rectilinear pentagon, because, between laying one piece and the next,\r\nthe caddis worm turns by the width of an arc corresponding with the\r\nlength of a soldering. The regularity of the method produces the\r\nregularity of the work; but it is essential, of course, that the\r\nmaterials should lend themselves to precise coordination.\r\n\r\nIn its natural pond, the caddis worm does not often have at its disposal\r\nthe picked joists which I give it in the tumbler. It comes across\r\nsomething of everything; and that something of everything it employs as\r\nit finds it. Bits of wood, large seeds, empty shells, stubble stalks,\r\nshapeless fragments are used in the building for better or for worse,\r\njust as they occur, without being trimmed by the saw; and this jumble,\r\nthe result of chance, results in a shockingly faulty structure.\r\n\r\nThe caddis worm does not forget its talents; but it lacks choice\r\npieces. Give it a proper timber yard and it at once reverts to correct\r\narchitecture, of which it carries the plans within itself. With small,\r\ndead pond snails, all of the same size, it fashions a splendid patchwork\r\nscabbard; with a cluster of slender roots, reduced by rotting to their\r\nstiff, straight, woody axis, it manufactures pretty specimens of wicker\r\nwork which could serve as models to our basket makers.\r\n\r\nLet us watch it at work when it is unable to use its favorite joist.\r\nThere is no point in giving it clumsy building stones; that would only\r\nbring us back to the uncouth sheaths. Its propensity to make use of\r\nsoaked seeds, those of the iris, for instance, suggests that I might\r\ntry grains. I select rice, which, because of its hardness, will be\r\ntantamount to wood and, because of its clean whiteness and its oval\r\nshape, will lend itself to artistic masonry.\r\n\r\nObviously, my denuded caddis worms cannot start their work with bricks\r\nof this kind. Where would they fix their first layer? They must have\r\na foundation, quick and easy to build. This is once more supplied by\r\na temporary cylinder of watercress roots. On this support follow the\r\ngrains of rice, which, grouped one atop the other, straight or slanting,\r\nend by giving a magnificent turret of ivory. Next to the sheaths made\r\nof tiny snail shells, this is the prettiest thing with which the caddis\r\nworm's industry has furnished me. A fine sense of order has returned,\r\nbecause the materials, regular and of identical character, have\r\ncooperated with the correct method of the worker.\r\n\r\nThe two demonstrations are enough. Sticks and grains of rice make it\r\nplain that the caddis worm is not the bungler that one would expect from\r\nthe monstrous buildings in the pond. Those Cyclopean piles, those mad\r\nconglomerations, are the inevitable results of chance finds, which are\r\nused for the best because there is no choice. The water carpenter has\r\nan art of its own, has method and rules of symmetry. When well served\r\nby fortune, it is quite able to turn out good work; when ill-served, it\r\nacts like others: the work which it turns out is bad. Poverty makes for\r\nugliness.\r\n\r\nThere is another matter wherein the caddis worm deserves our attention.\r\nWith a perseverance which repeated trials do not tire, it makes itself\r\na new tube when I strip it. This is opposed to the habits of the\r\ngenerality of insects, which do not recommence the thing once done, but\r\nsimply continue it according to the usual rules, taking no account\r\nof the ruined or vanished portions. The caddis worm is a striking\r\nexception: it starts again. Whence does it derive this capacity?\r\n\r\nI begin by learning that, given a sudden alarm, it readily leaves its\r\nscabbard. When I go fishing for caddis worms, I put them in tin boxes,\r\ncontaining no other moisture than that wherewith my catches are soaked.\r\nI heap them up loosely, to avoid any grievous tumult and to fill the\r\nspace at my disposal as best I may. I take no further precaution. This\r\nis enough to keep the caddis worms in good condition during the two or\r\nthree hours which I devote to fishing and to walking home.\r\n\r\nOn my return, I find that a number of them have left their houses. They\r\nare swarming naked among the empty scabbards and those still occupied\r\nby their inhabitants. It is a pitiful sight to see these evicted ones\r\ndragging their bare abdomens and their frail respiratory threads over\r\nthe bristling sticks. There is no great harm done, however; and I empty\r\nthe whole lot into the glass pond.\r\n\r\nNot one resumes possession of an unoccupied sheath. Perhaps it would\r\ntake them too long to find one of the exact size. They think it better\r\nto abandon the old clouts and to manufacture cases new from top to\r\nbottom. The process is a rapid one. By the next day, with the materials\r\nwherein the glass trough abounds--bundles of twigs and tufts of\r\nwatercress--all the denuded worms have made themselves at least a\r\ntemporary home in the form of a tube of rootlets.\r\n\r\nThe lack of water, combined with the excitement of the crowding in the\r\nboxes, has upset my captives greatly; and, scenting a grave peril,\r\nthey have made off hurriedly, doffing the cumbersome jacket, which is\r\ndifficult to carry. They have stripped themselves so as to flee with\r\ngreater ease. The alarm cannot have been due to me: there are not many\r\nsimpletons like myself who are interested in the affairs of the pond;\r\nand the caddis worm has not been cautioned against their tricks. The\r\nsudden desertion of the crib has certainly some other reason than man's\r\nmolestations.\r\n\r\nI catch a glimpse of this reason, the real one. The glass pond was\r\noriginally occupied by a dozen Dytisci, or water beetles, whose diving\r\nperformances are so curious to watch. One day, meaning no harm and for\r\nwant of a better receptacle, I fling among them a couple of handfuls\r\nof caddis worms. Blunderer that I am, what have I done! The corsairs,\r\nhiding in the rugged corners of the rock work, at once perceive the\r\nwindfall. They rise to the surface with great strokes of their oars;\r\nthey hasten and fling themselves upon the crowd of carpenters. Each\r\npirate grabs a sheath by the middle and strives to rip it open by\r\ntearing off shells and sticks. While this ferocious enucleation\r\ncontinues with the object of reaching the dainty morsel contained\r\nwithin, the caddis worm, close pressed, appears at the mouth of the\r\nsheath, slips out and quickly decamps under the eyes of the Dytiscus,\r\nwho appears to notice nothing.\r\n\r\nI have said before that the trade of killing can dispense with\r\nintelligence. The brutal ripper of sheaths does not see the little white\r\nsausage that slips between his legs, passes under his fangs and madly\r\nflees. He continues to tear away the outer case and to tug at the silken\r\nlining. When the breach is made, he is quite crestfallen at not finding\r\nwhat he expected.\r\n\r\nPoor fool! Your victim went out under your nose and you never saw it.\r\nThe worm has sunk to the bottom and taken refuge in the mysteries of the\r\nrock work. If things were happening in the large expanse of a pond, it\r\nis clear that, with their system of expeditious removals, most of the\r\nlodgers would escape scot-free. Fleeing to a distance and recovering\r\nfrom the sharp alarm, they would build themselves a new scabbard and all\r\nwould be over until the next attack, which would be baffled afresh by\r\nthe selfsame trick.\r\n\r\nIn my narrow trough, things take a more tragic turn. When the sheaths\r\nare done for, when the caddis worms that are too slow in making off have\r\nbeen eaten up, the Water beetles return to the rockery at the bottom.\r\nHere, sooner or later, there are lamentable happenings. The naked\r\nfugitives are discovered and, succulent morsels that they are, are\r\nforthwith torn to pieces and devoured. Within twenty-four hours, not\r\none of my band of caddis worms is left alive. In order to continue my\r\nstudies, I had to lodge the water beetles elsewhere.\r\n\r\nUnder natural conditions, the caddis worm has its persecutors, the most\r\nformidable of whom appears to be the Water beetle. When we consider\r\nthat, to thwart the brigand's attacks, it has invented the idea of\r\nquitting its scabbard with all speed, its tactics are certainly most\r\nappropriate; but, in that case, an exceptional condition becomes\r\nobligatory, namely, the capacity for recommencing the work. This most\r\nunusual gift of recommencing it possesses in a high measure. I am ready\r\nto see its origin in the persecutions of the Dytiscus and other pirates.\r\nNecessity is the mother of industry.\r\n\r\nCertain caddis worms, of the Sericostoma and Leptocerus species, clothe\r\nthemselves in grains of sand and do not leave the bed of the stream. On\r\na clear bottom, swept by the current, they walk about from one bank of\r\nverdure to the other and do not think of coming to the surface to float\r\nand sail in the sunlight. The collectors of sticks and shells are\r\nmore highly privileged. They can remain on the level of the water\r\nindefinitely, with no other support than their skiff, can rest in\r\nunsubmersible flotillas and can even shift their place by working the\r\nrudder.\r\n\r\nTo what do they owe this privilege? Are we to look upon the bundle of\r\nsticks as a sort of raft whose density is less than that of the water?\r\nCan the shells, which are always empty and able to contain a few bubbles\r\nof air in their spiral, he floats? Can the big joists, which break in so\r\nugly a fashion the none too great regularity of the work, serve to buoy\r\nup the over-heavy raft? In short, is the caddis worm versed in the\r\nlaws of equilibrium and does it choose its pieces, now lighter and now\r\nheavier as the case may be, so as to constitute a whole that is\r\ncapable of floating? The following facts are a refutation of any such\r\nhydrostatic calculations in the animal.\r\n\r\nI remove a number of caddis worms from their sheaths and submit these,\r\nas they are, to the test of water. Whether formed wholly of fibrous\r\nremnants or of mixed materials, not one of them floats. The scabbards\r\nmade of shells go to the bottom with the swiftness of a bit of gravel;\r\nthe others sink gently. I experiment with the separate materials one\r\nby one. No shell remains on the surface, not even among the Planorbes,\r\nwhich a many-whorled spiral ought, one would think, to keep afloat.\r\nThe fibrous remnants must be divided into two categories. The first,\r\ndarkened by time and soaked with moisture, sink to the bottom. These are\r\nthe most plentiful. The second, considerably fewer in number, of more\r\nrecent date and less saturated with water, float very well. The general\r\nresult is immersion, as in the case of the intact scabbards. I may add\r\nthat the animal, when removed from its tube, is also unable to float.\r\n\r\nThen how does the caddis worm manage to remain on the surface without\r\nthe support of the grasses, considering that itself and its sheath are\r\nboth heavier than water? Its secret is soon revealed. I place a few high\r\nand dry on a sheet of blotting paper, which will absorb the excess\r\nof liquid unfavorable to successful observation. Outside its natural\r\nenvironment, the animal moves about violently and restlessly. With its\r\nbody half out of the scabbard, this time composed entirely of fibrous\r\nmatter, it clutches with its feet at the supporting plane. Then,\r\ncontracting itself, it draws the scabbard towards it, half-raising it\r\nand sometimes even making it assume a vertical position. Even so do the\r\nBulimi move along, lifting their shell as they complete each crawling\r\nstep.\r\n\r\nAfter a couple of minutes in the free air, I replace the caddis worm\r\nin the water. This time, it floats, but like a cylinder with too much\r\nweight below. The sheath remains vertical, with its hinder orifice level\r\nwith the water. Soon, an air bubble escapes from the orifice. Deprived\r\nof this buoy, the skiff at once goes down.\r\n\r\nThe result is the same with the caddis worms in shell casings. At first,\r\nthey float, straight up on end, and then dip under and sink, faster\r\nthan the others, after sending out an air bubble or two through the back\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\nThat is enough: the secret is out. When cased in wood or in shells, the\r\ncaddis worms, which are always heavier than water, are able to keep\r\non the surface by means of a temporary air balloon which decreases the\r\ndensity of the whole structure.\r\n\r\nThis apparatus works in the simplest manner. Consider the rear of\r\nthe sheath. It is truncated, wide open and supplied with a membranous\r\npartition, the work of the spinneret. A round hole occupies the center\r\nof this screen. Beyond it lies the interior of the scabbard, which is\r\nsmoothly lined and wadded with satin, however rough the exterior may be.\r\nArmed at the stern with two hooks which bite into the silky lining,\r\nthe animal is able to move backwards and forwards at will inside the\r\ncylinder, to fix its grapnels at whatever point it pleases and thus to\r\nkeep a hold on the cylinder while the six legs and the fore part are\r\noutside.\r\n\r\nWhen at rest, the body remains indoors entirely and the grub occupies\r\nthe whole of the tube. But let it contract ever so little towards the\r\nfront, or, better still, let it stick out a part of its body: a vacuum\r\nis formed behind this sort of piston, which may be compared with that of\r\na pump. Thanks to the rear window, a valve without a plug, this vacuum\r\nat once fills, thus renewing the aerated water around the gills, a soft\r\nfleece of hairs distributed over the back and belly.\r\n\r\nThe piston stroke affects only the work of breathing; it does not alter\r\nthe density, makes hardly any change in that which is heavier than\r\nwater. To lighten the weight, the caddis worm must first rise to the\r\nsurface. With this object, it scales the grasses of one support after\r\nthe other; it clambers up, sticking to its purpose in spite of the\r\ndrawback of its faggot dragging through the tangle. When it has reached\r\nthe goal, it lifts the rear end a little above the water and gives a\r\nstroke of the piston. The vacuum thus obtained fills with air. That is\r\nenough: skiff and boatman are in a position to float. The now useless\r\nsupport of the grasses is abandoned. The time has come for evolutions on\r\nthe surface, in the glad sunlight.\r\n\r\nThe caddis worm possesses no great talent as a navigator. To turn round,\r\nto tack about, to shift its place slightly by a backward movement is all\r\nthat it can do; and even that it does very clumsily. The front part\r\nof the body, sticking out of the case, acts as a rudder. Three or four\r\ntimes over, it rises abruptly, bends, comes down again and strikes the\r\nwater. These paddle strokes, repeated at intervals, carry the unskilled\r\noarsman to fresh latitudes. It becomes a voyage on the right seas when\r\nthe crossing measures a hand's breadth.\r\n\r\nHowever, tacking on the surface of the water affords the caddis worm\r\nno pleasure. It prefers to twitter in one spot, to remain stationary in\r\nflotillas. When the time comes to return to the quiet of the mud bed\r\nat the bottom, the animal, having had enough of the sun, draws itself\r\nwholly into its sheath again and, with a piston stroke, expels the air\r\nfrom the back room. The normal density is restored and it sinks slowly\r\nto the bottom.\r\n\r\nWe see, therefore, that the caddis worm has not to trouble about\r\nhydrostatics when building its scabbard. In spite of the incongruity of\r\nits work, in which the bulky and less dense portions seem to balance\r\nthe more solid, concentrated part, it is not called upon to contrive\r\nan equipoise between the light and the heavy. It has other artifices\r\nwhereby to rise to the surface, to float and to dive down again. The\r\nascent is made by the ladder of the water weeds. The average density of\r\nthe sheath is of no importance, so long as the burden to be dragged is\r\nnot beyond the animal's strength. Besides, the weight of the load is\r\ngreatly reduced when moved in the water.\r\n\r\nThe admission of a bubble of air into the back chamber, which the animal\r\nceases to occupy, allow it, without further to-do, to remain for an\r\nindefinite period on the surface. To dive down again, the caddis worm\r\nhas only to retreat entirely into its sheath. The air is driven out; and\r\nthe canoe, resuming its mean density, a greater specific density than\r\nthat of water, goes under at once and descends of its own accord.\r\n\r\nThere is, therefore, no choice of materials on the builder's part, no\r\nnice calculation of equilibrium, save for one condition, that no stony\r\nmatter be admitted. That apart, everything serves, large and small,\r\njoist and shell, seed and billet. Built up at haphazard, all these\r\nthings make an impregnable wall. One point alone is essential: the\r\nweight of the whole must slightly exceed that of the water displaced; if\r\nnot, there could be no steadiness at the bottom of the pond, without\r\na perpetual anchorage struggling against the pull of the water. In the\r\nsame manner, quick submersion would be impossible at times when the\r\nsurface became dangerous and the frightened creature wanted to leave it.\r\n\r\nNor does this important heavier-than-water question call for lucid\r\ndiscernment, seeing that almost the whole of the sheath is constructed\r\nat the bottom of the pond, whither all the materials picked up at\r\nrandom, having descended once before, are likely to descend again. In\r\nthe sheaths, the parts capable of floating are very rare. Without taking\r\ntheir specific levity into account, simply so as not to remain idle, the\r\ncaddis worm fixed them to its bundle when sporting on the surface of the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nWe have our submarines, in which hydraulic ingenuity displays its\r\nhighest resources. The caddis worms have theirs, which emerge, float on\r\nthe surface, dip down and even stop at mid-depth by releasing gradually\r\ntheir surplus air. And this apparatus, so perfectly balanced, so\r\nskilful, requires no knowledge on the part of its constructor. It comes\r\ninto being of itself, in accordance with the plans of the universal\r\nharmony of things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. THE GREENBOTTLES\r\n\r\nI have wished for a few things in my life, none of them capable of\r\ninterfering with the common weal. I have longed to possess a pond,\r\nscreened from the indiscretion of the passers by, close to my house,\r\nwith clumps of rushes and patches of duckweed. Here, in my leisure\r\nhours, in the shade of a willow, I should have meditated upon aquatic\r\nlife, a primitive life, easier than our own, simpler in its affections\r\nand its brutalities. I should have watched the unalloyed happiness of\r\nthe mollusk, the frolics of the Whirligig, the figure-skating of the\r\nHydrometra [a water bug known as the Pond skater], the dives of the\r\nDytiscus beetle, the veering and tacking of the Notonecta [the water\r\nboatman], who, lying on her back, rows with two long oars, while her\r\nshort forelegs, folded against her chest, wait to grab the coming prey.\r\nI should have studied the eggs of the Planorbis, a glairy nebula wherein\r\nfocuses of life are condensed even as suns are condensed in the nebulae\r\nof the heavens. I should have admired the nascent creature that turns,\r\nslowly turns in the orb of its egg and describes a volute, the draft,\r\nperhaps, of the future shell. No planet circles round its center of\r\nattraction with greater geometrical accuracy.\r\n\r\nI should have brought back a few ideas from my frequent visits to the\r\npond. Fate decided otherwise: I was not to have my sheet of water. I\r\nhave tried the artificial pond, between four panes of glass. A poor\r\nshift! Our laboratory aquariums are not even equal to the print left in\r\nthe mud by a mule's hoof, when once a shower has filled the humble basin\r\nand life has stocked it with its marvels.\r\n\r\nIn spring, with the hawthorn in flower and the crickets at their\r\nconcerts, a second wish often came to me. Along the road, I light upon a\r\ndead mole, a snake killed with a stone, victims both of human folly.\r\nThe mole was draining the soil and purging it of its vermin. Finding him\r\nunder his spade, the laborer broke his back for him and flung him over\r\nthe hedge. The snake, roused from her slumber by the soft warmth of\r\nApril, was coming into the sun to shed her skin and take on a new one.\r\nMan catches sight of her: 'Ah, would you?' says he. 'See me do something\r\nfor which the world will thank me!'\r\n\r\nAnd the harmless beast, our auxiliary in the terrible battle which\r\nhusbandry wages against the insect, has its head smashed in and dies.\r\n\r\nThe two corpses, already decomposing, have begun to smell. Whoever\r\napproaches with eyes that do not see turns away his head and passes\r\non. The observer stops and lifts the remains with his foot; he looks. A\r\nworld is swarming underneath; life is eagerly consuming the dead. Let us\r\nreplace matters as they were and leave death's artisans to their task.\r\nThey are engaged in a most deserving work.\r\n\r\nTo know the habits of those creatures charged with the disappearance of\r\ncorpses, to see them busy at their work of disintegration, to follow\r\nin detail the process of transmutation that makes the ruins of what has\r\nlived return apace into life's treasure house: these are things that\r\nlong haunted my mind. I regretfully left the mole lying in the dust of\r\nthe road. I had to go, after a glance at the corpse and its harvesters.\r\nIt was not the place for philosophizing over a stench. What would people\r\nsay who passed and saw me!\r\n\r\nAnd what will the reader himself say, if I invite him to that sight?\r\nSurely, to busy one's self with those squalid sextons means soiling\r\none's eyes and mind? Not so, if you please! Within the domain of our\r\nrestless curiosity, two questions stand out above all others: the\r\nquestion of the beginning and the question of the end. How does matter\r\nunite in order to assume life? How does it separate when returning to\r\ninertia? The pond, with its Planorbis eggs turning round and round,\r\nwould have given us a few data for the first problem; the Mole, going\r\nbad under conditions not too repulsive, will tell us something about the\r\nsecond: he will show us the working of the crucible wherein all things\r\nare melted to begin anew. A truce to nice delicacy! Odi profanum vulgus\r\net arceo; hence, ye profane: you would not understand the mighty lesson\r\nof the rag tank.\r\n\r\nI am now in a position to realize my second wish. I have space, air and\r\nquiet in the solitude of the harmas. None will come here to trouble me,\r\nto smile or to be shocked at my investigations. So far, so good; but\r\nobserve the irony of things: now that I am rid of passers by, I have to\r\nfear my cats, those assiduous prowlers, who, finding my preparations,\r\nwill not fail to spoil and scatter them. In anticipation of their\r\nmisdeeds, I establish workshops in midair, whither none but genuine\r\ncorruption agents can come, flying on their wings. At different points\r\nin the enclosure, I plant reeds, three by three, which, tied at their\r\nfree ends, form a stable tripod. From each of these supports, I hang, at\r\na man's height, an earthenware pan filled with fine sand and pierced at\r\nthe bottom with a hole to allow the water to escape, if it should rain.\r\nI garnish my apparatus with dead bodies. The snake, the lizard, the toad\r\nreceive the preference, because of their bare skins, which enable me\r\nbetter to follow the first attack and the work of the invaders. I ring\r\nthe changes with furred and feathered beasts. A few children of the\r\nneighborhood, allured by pennies, are my regular purveyors. Throughout\r\nthe good season, they come running triumphantly to my door, with a snake\r\nat the end of a stick, or a lizard in a cabbage leaf. They bring me the\r\nrat caught in a trap, the chicken dead of the pip, the mole slain by\r\nthe gardener, the kitten killed by accident, the rabbit poisoned by some\r\nweed. The business proceeds to the mutual satisfaction of sellers and\r\nbuyer. No such trade had ever been known before in the village nor ever\r\nwill be again.\r\n\r\nApril ends; and the pans rapidly fill. An ant, ever so small, is the\r\nfirst arrival. I thought I should keep this intruder off by hanging my\r\napparatus high above the ground: she laughs at my precautions. A few\r\nhours after the deposit of the morsel, fresh still and possessing no\r\nappreciable smell, up comes the eager picker-up of trifles, scales the\r\nstems of the tripod in processions and starts the work of dissection.\r\nIf the joint suits her, she even goes to live in the sand of the pan and\r\ndigs herself temporary platforms in order to work the rich find more at\r\nher ease.\r\n\r\nAll through the season, from start to finish, she will always be the\r\npromptest, always the first to discover the dead animal, always the last\r\nto beat a retreat when nothing more remains than a heap of little bones\r\nbleached by the sun. How does the vagabond, passing at a distance, know\r\nthat, up there, invisible, high on the gibbet, there is something worth\r\ngoing for? The others, the real knackers, wait for the meat to go bad;\r\nthey are informed by the strength of the effluvia. The ant, gifted with\r\ngreater powers of scent, hurries up before there is any stench at all.\r\nBut, when the meat, now two days old and ripened by the sun, exhales its\r\nflavor, soon the master ghouls appear upon the scene: Dermestes [bacon\r\nbeetles, small flesh-eating beetles] and Saprini [exceedingly small\r\nflesh-eating beetles], Silphae [carrion beetles] and Necrophori [burying\r\nbeetles], flies and Staphylini [rove beetles], who attack the corpse,\r\nconsume it and reduce it almost to nothing. With the ant alone, who\r\neach time carries off a mere atom, the sanitary operation would take too\r\nlong; with them, it is a quick business, especially as certain of them\r\nunderstand the process of chemical solvents.\r\n\r\nThese last, who are high class scavengers, are entitled to first\r\nmention. They are flies, of many various species. If time permitted,\r\neach of those strenuous ones would deserve a special examination; but\r\nthat would weary the patience of both the reader and the observer. The\r\nhabits of one will give us a summary notion of the habits of the rest.\r\nWe will therefore confine ourselves to the two principal subjects,\r\nnamely, the Luciliae, or greenbottles, and the Sarcophagae, or grey\r\nflesh flies.\r\n\r\nThe Luciliae--flies that glitter--are magnificent flies known to all of\r\nus. Their metallic luster, generally a golden green, rivals that of our\r\nfinest beetles, the Rosechafers, Buprestes and leaf beetles. It gives\r\none a shock of surprise to see so rich a garb adorn those workers in\r\nputrefaction. Three species frequent my pans: Lucilia Caesar, LIN., L.\r\ncadaverina, LIN., and L. cuprea, ROB. The first two, both of whom are\r\ngold-green, are plentiful; the third, who sports a coppery luster, is\r\nrare. All three have red eyes, set in a silver border.\r\n\r\nLucilia Caesar is larger than L. cadaverina and also more forward in her\r\nbusiness. I catch her in labor on the 23rd of April. She has settled\r\nin the spinal canal of a neck of mutton and is laying her eggs on the\r\nmarrow. For more than an hour, motionless in the gloomy cavity, she goes\r\non packing her eggs. I can just see her red eyes and her silvery face.\r\nAt last, she comes out. I gather the fruit of her labor, an easy matter,\r\nfor it all lies on the marrow, which I extract without touching the\r\neggs.\r\n\r\nA census would seem important. To take it at once is impracticable: the\r\ngerms form a compact mass, which would be difficult to count. The best\r\nthing is to rear the family in a jar and to reckon by the pupae buried\r\nin the sand. I find a hundred and fifty-seven. This is evidently but\r\na minimum; for Lucilia Caesar and the others, as the observations that\r\nfollow will tell me, lay in packets at repeated intervals. It is a\r\nmagnificent family, promising a fabulous legion to come.\r\n\r\nThe greenbottles, I was saying, break up their laying into sections. The\r\nfollowing scene affords a proof of this. A Mole, shrunk by a few days'\r\nevaporation, lies spread upon the sand of the pan. At one point, the\r\nedge of the belly is raised and forms a deep arch. Remark that the\r\nGreenbottles, like the rest of the flesh eating flies, do not trust\r\ntheir eggs to uncovered surfaces, where the heat of the sun's rays might\r\nendanger the existence of the delicate germs. They want dark hiding\r\nplaces. The favorite spot is the lower side of the dead animal, when\r\nthis is accessible.\r\n\r\nIn the present case, the only place of access is the fold formed by the\r\nedge of the belly. It is here and here alone that this day's mothers\r\nare laying. There are eight of them. After exploring the piece and\r\nrecognizing its good quality, they disappear under the arch, first this\r\none, then that, or else several at a time. They remain under the Mole\r\nfor a considerable while. Those outside wait, but go repeatedly to the\r\nthreshold of the cavern to take a look at what is happening within and\r\nsee whether the earlier ones have finished. These come out at last,\r\nperch on the animal and wait in their turn. Others at once take their\r\nplace in the recesses of the cave. They remain there for some time and\r\nthen, having done their business, make room for more mothers and come\r\nforth into the sunlight. This going in and out continues throughout the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nWe thus learn that the laying is effected by periodical emissions,\r\nbroken with intervals of rest. As long as she does not feel ripe eggs\r\ncoming to her oviduct, the greenbottle remains in the sun, hovering to\r\nand fro and sipping modest mouthfuls from the carcass. But, as soon as a\r\nfresh stream descends from her ovaries, quick as lightning she makes for\r\na propitious site whereon to deposit her burden. It appears to be the\r\nwork of several days thus to divide the total laying and to distribute\r\nit at different points.\r\n\r\nI carefully raise the animal under which these things are happening.\r\nThe egg laying mothers do not disturb themselves; they are far too busy.\r\nTheir ovipositor extended telescope fashion, they heap egg upon egg.\r\nWith the point of their hesitating, groping instrument, they try to\r\nlodge each germ, as it comes, farther into the mass. Around the serious,\r\nred-eyed matrons, the Ants circle, intent on pillage. Many of them make\r\noff with a greenbottle egg between their teeth. I see some who, greatly\r\ndaring, effect their theft under the ovipositor itself. The layers do\r\nnot put themselves out, let the ants have their way, remain impassive.\r\nThey know their womb to be rich enough to make good any such larceny.\r\n\r\nIndeed, what escapes the depredations of the ants promises a plenteous\r\nbrood. Let us come back a few days later and lift the mole again.\r\nUnderneath, in a pool of sanies, is a surging mass of swarming sterns\r\nand pointed heads, which emerge, wriggle and dive in again. It suggests\r\na seething billow. It turns one's stomach. It is horrible, most\r\nhorrible. Let us steel ourselves against the sight: it will be worse\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nHere is a fat snake. Rolled into a compact whorl, she fills the whole\r\npan. The greenbottles are plentiful. New ones arrive at every moment\r\nand, without quarrel or strife, take their place among the others,\r\nbusily laying. The spiral furrow left by the reptile's curves is the\r\nfavorite spot. Here alone, in the narrow space between the folds, are\r\nshelters against the heat of the sun. The glistening Flies take their\r\nplaces, side by side, in rows; they strive to push their abdomen and\r\ntheir ovipositor as far forward as possible, at the risk of rumpling\r\ntheir wings and cocking them towards their heads. The care of the person\r\nis neglected amid this serious business. Placidly, with their red eyes\r\nturned outwards, they form a continuous cordon. Here and there, at\r\nintervals, the rank is broken; layers leave their posts, come and\r\nwalk about upon the snake, what time their ovaries ripen for another\r\nemission, and then hurry back, slip into the rank and resume the flow of\r\ngerms. Despite these interruptions, the work of breeding goes fast. In\r\nthe course of one morning, the depths of the spiral furrow are hung\r\nwith a continuous white bark, the heaped up eggs. They come off in great\r\nslabs, free of any stain; they can be shoveled up, as it were, with\r\na paper scoop. It is a propitious moment if we wish to follow the\r\nevolution at close quarters. I therefore gather a profusion of this\r\nwhite manna and lodge it in glass tubes, test tubes and jars, with the\r\nnecessary provisions.\r\n\r\nThe eggs, about a millimeter long, are smooth cylinders, rounded at\r\nboth ends. They hatch within twenty-four hours. The first question that\r\npresents itself is this: how do the greenbottle grubs feed? I know quite\r\nwell what to give them, but I do not in the least see how they manage to\r\nconsume it. Do they eat, in the strict sense of the word? I have reasons\r\nto doubt it.\r\n\r\nLet us consider the grub grown to a sufficient size. It is the usual\r\nfly larva, the common maggot, shaped like an elongated cone, pointed in\r\nfront, truncated behind, where two little red spots show, level with the\r\nskin: these are the breathing holes. The front, which is called the\r\nhead by stretching a word--for it is little more than the entrance to an\r\nintestine--the front is armed with two little black hooks, which slide\r\nin a translucent sheath, project a little way outside and go in turn by\r\nturn. Are we to look upon these as mandibles? Not at all, for, instead\r\nof having their points facing each other, as would be required in a\r\nreal mandibular apparatus, the two hooks work in parallel directions\r\nand never meet. What they are is ambulatory organs, grapnels assisting\r\nlocomotion, which give a purchase on the plane and enable the animal to\r\nadvance by means of repeated contractions. The maggot walks with the aid\r\nof what a superficial examination would pronounce to be a machine\r\nfor eating. It carries in its gullet the equivalent of the climber's\r\nalpenstock.\r\n\r\nLet us hold it, on a piece of flesh, under the lens. We shall see it\r\nwalking about, raising and lowering its head and, each time, stabbing\r\nthe meat with its pair of hooks. When stationary, with its crupper at\r\nrest, it explores space with a continual bending of its fore part; its\r\npointed head pokes about, jabs forward, goes back again, producing and\r\nwithdrawing its black mechanism. There is a perpetual piston play. Well,\r\nlook as carefully and conscientiously as I please, I do not once see the\r\nweapons of the mouth tackle a particle of flesh that is torn away and\r\nswallowed. The hooks come down upon the meat at every moment, but never\r\ntake a visible mouthful from it. Nevertheless, the grub waxes big and\r\nfat. How does this singular consumer, who feeds without eating, set\r\nabout it? If he does not eat, he must drink; his diet is soup. As meat\r\nis a compact substance, which does not liquefy of its own accord, there\r\nmust, in that case, be a certain recipe to dissolve it into a fluid\r\nbroth. Let us try to surprise the maggot's secret.\r\n\r\nIn a glass tube, sealed at one end, I insert a piece of lean flesh, the\r\nsize of a walnut, which I have drained of its juices by squeezing it in\r\nblotting paper. On the top of this, I place a few slabs of greenbottle\r\neggs collected a moment ago from the snake in my earthen pan. The number\r\nof germs is, roughly, two hundred. I close the tube with a cotton plug,\r\nstand it upright, in a shady corner of my study, and leave things to\r\ntake their course. A control tube, prepared like the first, but not\r\nstocked with maggots, is placed beside it.\r\n\r\nAs early as two or three days after the hatching, I obtain a striking\r\nresult. The meat, which was thoroughly drained by the blotting paper,\r\nhas become so moist that the young vermin leave a wet mark behind them\r\nas they crawl over the glass. The swarming brood creates a sort of mist\r\nwith the crossing and criss-crossing of its trails. The control tube,\r\non the contrary, keeps dry, proving that the moisture in which the worms\r\nmove is not due to a mere exudation from the meat.\r\n\r\nBesides, the work of the maggot becomes more and more evident.\r\nGradually, the flesh flows in every direction like an icicle placed\r\nbefore the fire. Soon, the liquefaction is complete. What we see is no\r\nlonger meat, but fluid Liebig's extract. If I overturned the tube, not a\r\ndrop of it would remain.\r\n\r\nLet us clear our minds of any idea of solution by putrefaction, for in\r\nthe second tube a piece of meat of the same kind and size has remained,\r\nsave for color and smell, what it was at the start. It was a lump and\r\nit is a lump, whereas the piece treated by the worms runs like melted\r\nbutter. Here we have maggot chemistry able to rouse the envy of\r\nphysiologists when studying the action of the gastric juice.\r\n\r\nI obtain better results still with hard-boiled white of egg. When cut\r\ninto pieces the size of a hazel nut and handed over to the greenbottle's\r\ngrubs, the coagulated albumen dissolves into a colorless liquid which\r\nthe eye might mistake for water. The fluidity becomes so great that, for\r\nlack of a support, the worms perish by drowning in the broth; they are\r\nsuffocated by the immersion of their hind part, with its open breathing\r\nholes. On a denser liquid, they would have kept at the surface; on this,\r\nthey cannot.\r\n\r\nA control tube, filled in the same way, but not colonized, stands beside\r\nthat in which the strange liquefaction takes place. The hardboiled white\r\nof egg retains its original appearance and consistency. In course of\r\ntime, it dries up, if it does not turn moldy; and that is all.\r\n\r\nThe other quaternary compounds performing the same functions as\r\nalbumen--the gluten of cereals, the fibrin of blood, the casein of\r\ncheese and the legumin of chickpeas--undergo a similar modification, in\r\nvarying degrees. Fed, from the moment of leaving the egg, on any one of\r\nthese substances, the worms thrive very well, provided that they escape\r\ndrowning when the gruel becomes too clear; they would not fare better\r\non a corpse. And, as a general rule, there is not much danger of going\r\nunder: the matter only half liquefies; it becomes a running pea soup,\r\nrather than an actual fluid.\r\n\r\nEven in this imperfect case, it is obvious that the greenbottle grubs\r\nbegin by liquefying their food. Incapable of taking solid nourishment,\r\nthey first transform the spoil into running matter; then, dipping their\r\nheads into the product, they drink, they slake their thirst, with long\r\nsups. Their dissolvent, comparable in its effects with the gastric juice\r\nof the higher animals, is, beyond a doubt, emitted through the mouth.\r\nThe piston of the hooks, continually in movement, never ceases spitting\r\nit out in infinitesimal doses. Each spot touched receives a grain of\r\nsome subtle pepsin, which soon suffices to make that spot run in every\r\ndirection. As digesting, when all is said, merely means liquefying,\r\nit is no paradox to assert that the maggot digests its food before\r\nswallowing it.\r\n\r\nThese experiments with my filthy, evil smelling tubes have given me some\r\ndelightful moments. The worthy Abbe Spallanzani must have known some\r\nsuch when he saw pieces of raw meat begin to run under the action of the\r\ngastric juice which he took, with pellets of sponge, from the stomachs\r\nof crows. He discovered the secrets of digestion; he realized in a glass\r\ntube the hitherto unknown labors of gastric chemistry. I, his distant\r\ndisciple, behold once more, under a most unexpected aspect, what struck\r\nthe Italian scientist so forcibly. Worms take the place of the crows.\r\nThey slaver upon meat, gluten, albumen; and those substances turn to\r\nfluid. What our stomach does within its mysterious recesses the maggot\r\nachieves outside, in the open air. It first digests and then imbibes.\r\n\r\nWhen we see it plunging into the carrion broth, we even wonder if it\r\ncannot feed itself, at least to some extent, in a more direct fashion.\r\nWhy should not its skin, which is one of the most delicate, be capable\r\nof absorbing? I have seen the egg of the sacred beetle and other dung\r\nbeetles growing considerably larger--I should like to say, feeding--in\r\nthe thick atmosphere of the hatching chamber. Nothing tells us that the\r\ngrub of the greenbottle does not adopt this method of growing. I picture\r\nit capable of feeding all over the surface of its body. To the gruel\r\nabsorbed by the mouth it adds the balance of what is gathered and\r\nstrained through the skin. This would explain the need for provisions\r\nliquefied beforehand.\r\n\r\nLet us give one last proof of this preliminary liquefaction. If the\r\ncarcass--mole, snake or another--left in the open air have a wire gauze\r\ncover placed over it, to keep out the flies, the game dries under a hot\r\nsun and shrivels up without appreciably wetting the sand on which it\r\nlies. Fluids come from it, certainly, for every organized body is a\r\nsponge swollen with water; but the liquid discharge is so slow and\r\nrestricted in quantity that the heat and the dryness of the air disperse\r\nit as it appears, while the underlying sand remains dry, or very nearly\r\nso. The carcass becomes a sapless mummy, a mere bit of leather. On the\r\nother hand, do not use the wire gauze cover, let the flies do their work\r\nunimpeded; and things forthwith assume another aspect. In three or four\r\ndays, an oozing sanies appears under the animal and soaks the sand to\r\nsome distance.\r\n\r\nI shall never forget the striking spectacle with which I conclude this\r\nchapter. This time, the dish is a magnificent Aesculapius' snake, a yard\r\nand a half long and as thick as a wide bottleneck. Because of its size,\r\nwhich exceeds the dimensions of my pan, I roll the reptile in a double\r\nspiral, or in two storeys. When the copious joint is in full process\r\nof dissolution, the pan becomes a puddle wherein wallow, in countless\r\nnumbers, the grubs of the greenbottle and those of Sarcophaga carnaria,\r\nthe Grey or checkered flesh fly, which are even mightier liquefiers. All\r\nthe sand in the apparatus is saturated, has turned into mud, as though\r\nthere had been a shower of rain. Through the hole at the bottom, which\r\nis protected by a flat pebble, the gruel trickles drop by drop. It is a\r\nstill at work, a mortuary still, in which the Snake is being drawn off.\r\nWait a week or two; and the whole will have disappeared, drunk up by the\r\nsun: naught but the scales and bones will remain on a sheet of mud.\r\n\r\nTo conclude: the maggot is a power in this world. To give back to life,\r\nwith all speed, the remains of that which has lived, it macerates and\r\ncondenses corpses, distilling them into an essence wherewith the earth,\r\nthe plant's foster mother, may be nourished and enriched.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. THE GREY FLESH FLIES\r\n\r\nHere the costume changes, not the manner of life. We find the\r\nsame frequenting of dead bodies, the same capacity for the speedy\r\nliquefaction of the fleshy matter. I am speaking of an ash-gray fly,\r\nthe greenbottle's superior in size, with brown streaks on her back and\r\nsilver gleams on her abdomen. Note also the blood-red eyes, with the\r\nhard look of the knacker in them. The language of science knows her as\r\nSarcophaga, the flesh eater; in the vulgar tongue she is the grey flesh\r\nfly, or simply the flesh fly.\r\n\r\nLet not these expressions, however accurate, mislead us into believing\r\nfor a moment that the Sarcophagae are the bold company of master\r\ntainters who haunt our dwellings, more particularly in autumn, and plant\r\ntheir vermin in our ill-guarded viands. The author of those offences\r\nis Calliphora vomitoria, the bluebottle, who is of a stouter build and\r\narrayed in darkest blue. It is she who buzzes against our windowpanes,\r\nwho craftily besieges the meat safe and who lies in wait in the darkness\r\nfor an opportunity to outwit our vigilance. The other, the grey fly,\r\nworks jointly with the greenbottles, who do not venture inside our\r\nhouses and who work in the sunlight. Less timid, however, than they,\r\nshould the outdoor yield be small, she will sometimes come indoors to\r\nperpetrate her villainies. When her business is done, she makes off as\r\nfast as she can, for she does not feel at home with us.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, my study, a very modest extension of my open air\r\nestablishments, has become something of a charnel house. The grey fly\r\npays me a visit. If I lay a piece of butcher's meat on the windowsill,\r\nshe hastens up, works her will on it and retires. No hiding place\r\nescapes her notice among the jars, cups, glasses and receptacles of\r\nevery kind with which my shelves are crowded.\r\n\r\nWith a view to certain experiments, I collected a heap of wasp grubs,\r\nasphyxiated in their underground nests. Stealthily she arrives,\r\ndiscovers the fat pile and, hailing as treasure trove this provender\r\nwhereof her race perhaps has never made use before, entrusts to it an\r\ninstallment of her family. I have left at the bottom of a glass the best\r\npart of a hard-boiled egg from which I have taken a few bits of white\r\nintended for the greenbottle maggots. The grey fly takes possession of\r\nthe remains, recks not of their novelty and colonizes them. Everything\r\nsuits her that falls within the category of albuminous matters:\r\neverything, down to dead silkworms; everything, down to a mess of\r\nkidney-beans and chick-peas.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, her preference is for the corpse: furred beast and\r\nfeathered beast, reptile and fish, indifferently. Together with the\r\ngreenbottles, she is sedulous in her attendance on my pans. Daily she\r\nvisits my snakes, takes note of the condition of each of them, savors\r\nthem with her proboscis, goes away, comes back, takes her time and at\r\nlast proceeds to business. Still, it is not here, amid the tumult of\r\ncallers, that I propose to follow her operations. A lump of butcher's\r\nmeat laid on the window sill, in front of my writing table, will be less\r\noffensive to the eye and will facilitate my observations.\r\n\r\nTwo flies of the genus Sarcophaga frequent my slaughter yard: Sarcophaga\r\ncarnaria and Sarcophaga haemorrhoidalis, whose abdomen ends in a red\r\nspeck. The first species, which is a little larger than the second,\r\nis more numerous and does the best part of the work in the open air\r\nshambles of the pans. It is this fly also who, at intervals and nearly\r\nalways alone, hastens to the bait exposed on the windowsill.\r\n\r\nShe comes up suddenly, timidly. Soon she calms herself and no longer\r\nthinks of fleeing when I draw near, for the dish suits her. She is\r\nsurprisingly quick about her work. Twice over--buzz! Buzz!--the tip of\r\nher abdomen touches the meat; and the thing is done: a group of vermin\r\nwriggles out, releases itself and disperses so nimbly that I have no\r\ntime to take my lens and count then accurately. As seen by the naked\r\neye, there were a dozen of them. What has become of them? One would\r\nthink that they had gone into the flesh, at the very spot where they\r\nwere laid, so quickly have they disappeared. But that dive into a\r\nsubstance of some consistency is impossible to these newborn weaklings.\r\nWhere are they? I find them more or less everywhere in the creases of\r\nthe meat; singly and already groping with their mouths. To collect them\r\nin order to number them is not practicable, for I do not want to damage\r\nthem. Let us be satisfied with the estimate made at a rapid glance:\r\nthere are a dozen or so, brought into the world in one discharge of\r\nalmost inappreciable length.\r\n\r\nThose live grubs, taking the place of the usual eggs, have long been\r\nknown. Everybody is aware that the flesh flies bring forth living\r\nmaggots, instead of laying eggs. They have so much to do and their work\r\nis so urgent! To them, the instruments of the transformation of\r\ndead matter, a day means a day, a long space of time which it is all\r\nimportant to utilize. The greenbottle's eggs, though these are of very\r\nrapid development, take twenty-four hours to yield their grubs. The\r\nflesh flies save all this time. From their matrix, laborers flow\r\nstraightway and set to work the moment they are born. With these ardent\r\npioneers of sanitation, there is no rest attendant upon the hatching,\r\nthere is not a minute lost.\r\n\r\nThe gang, it is true, is not a numerous one; but how often can it not\r\nbe renewed! Read Reaumur's description of the wonderful procreating\r\nmachinery boasted by the Flesh flies. It is a spiral ribbon, a velvety\r\nscroll whose nap is a sort of fleece of maggots set closely together\r\nand each cased in a sheath. The patient biographer counted the host:\r\nit numbers, he tells us, nearly twenty thousand. You are seized with\r\nstupefaction at this anatomical fact.\r\n\r\nHow does the gray fly find the time to settle a family of such\r\ndimensions, especially in small packets, as she has just done on my\r\nwindow sill? What a number of dead dogs, moles and snakes must she not\r\nvisit before exhausting her womb! Will she find them? Corpses of much\r\nsize do not abound to that extent in the country. As everything suits\r\nher, she will alight on other remains of minor importance. Should the\r\nprize be a rich one, she will return to it tomorrow, the day after and\r\nlater still, over and over again. In the course of the season, by dint\r\nof packets of grubs deposited here, there and everywhere, she will\r\nperhaps end by housing her entire brood. But then, if all things\r\nprosper, what a glut, for there are several families born during\r\nthe year! We feel it instinctively: there must be a check to these\r\ngenerative enormities. Let us first consider the grub. It is a sturdy\r\nmaggot, easy to distinguish from the greenbottle's by its larger girth\r\nand especially by the way in which its body terminates behind. There is\r\nhere a sudden breaking off, hollowed into a deep cup. At the bottom of\r\nthis crater are two breathing holes, two stigmata with amber-red tips.\r\nThe edge of the cavity is fringed with half a score of pointed, fleshy\r\nfestoons, which diverge like the spikes of a coronet. The creature\r\ncan close or open this diadem at will by bringing the denticulations\r\ntogether or by spreading them out wide. This protects the air holes\r\nwhich might otherwise be choked up when the maggot disappears in the sea\r\nof broth. Asphyxia would supervene, if the two breathing holes at the\r\nback became obstructed. During the immersion, the festooned coronet\r\nshuts like a flower closing its petals and the liquid is not admitted to\r\nthe cavity.\r\n\r\nNext follows the emergence. The hind part reappears in the air, but\r\nappears alone, just at the level of the fluid. Then the coronet spreads\r\nout afresh, the cup gapes and assumes the aspect of a tiny flower, with\r\nthe white denticulations for petals and the two bright red dots, the\r\nstigmata at the bottom, for stamens. When the grubs, pressed one\r\nagainst the other, with their heads downwards in the fetid soup, make\r\nan unbroken shoal, the sight of those breathing cups incessantly opening\r\nand closing, with a little clack like a valve, almost makes one forget\r\nthe horrors of the charnel yard. It suggests a carpet of tiny Sea\r\nanemones. The maggot has its beauties after all.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious, if there be any logic in things, that a grub so\r\nwell-protected against asphyxiation by drowning must frequent liquid\r\nsurroundings. One does not encircle one's hindquarters with a coronet\r\nfor the sole satisfaction of displaying it. With its apparatus of\r\nspokes, the Grey Fly's grub informs us of the dangerous nature of its\r\nfunctions: when working upon a corpse, it runs the risk of drowning. How\r\nis that? Remember the grubs of the greenbottle, fed on hard-boiled white\r\nof egg. The dish suits them; only, by the action of their pepsin,\r\nit becomes so fluid that they die submerged. Because of their hinder\r\nstigmata, which are actually on the skin and devoid of any defensive\r\nmachinery, they perish when they find no support apart from the liquid.\r\n\r\nThe flesh fly's maggots, though incomparable liquefiers, know nothing\r\nof this peril, even in a puddle of carrion broth. Their bulky hind part\r\nserves as a float and keeps the air holes above the surface. When, for\r\nfurther investigation, they must needs go under completely, the anemone\r\nat the back shuts and protects the stigmata. The grubs of the gray fly\r\nare endowed with a life buoy because they are first class liquefiers,\r\nready to incur the danger of a ducking at any moment.\r\n\r\nWhen high and dry on the sheet of cardboard where I place them to\r\nobserve them at my ease, they move about actively, with their breathing\r\nrose widespread and their stigmata rising and falling as a support. The\r\ncardboard is on my table, at three steps from an open window, and lit at\r\nthis time of day only by the soft light of the sky. Well, the maggots,\r\none and all of them, turn in the opposite direction to the window; they\r\nhastily, madly take to flight.\r\n\r\nI turn the cardboard round, without touching the runaways. This action\r\nmakes the creatures face the light again. Forthwith, the troop stops,\r\nhesitates, takes a half turn and once more retreats towards the\r\ndarkness. Before the end of the racecourse is reached, I again turn the\r\ncardboard. For the second time, the maggots veer round and retrace their\r\nsteps. Repeat the experiment as often as I will, each time the squad\r\nwheels about in the opposite direction to the window and persists in\r\navoiding the trap of the revolving cardboard.\r\n\r\nThe track is only a short one: the cardboard measures three hand's\r\nbreadths in length. Let us give more space. I settle the grubs on the\r\nfloor of the room; with a hair pencil, I turn them with their heads\r\npointing towards the lighted aperture. The moment they are free, they\r\nturn and run from the light. With all the speed whereof their cripple's\r\nshuffle allows, they cover the tiled floor of the study and go and knock\r\ntheir heads against the wall, twelve feet off, skirting it afterwards,\r\nsome to the right and some to the left. They never feel far enough away\r\nfrom that hateful illuminated opening.\r\n\r\nWhat they are escaping from is evidently the light, for, if I make it\r\ndark with a screen, the troop does not change its direction when I turn\r\nthe cardboard. It then progresses quite readily towards the window; but,\r\nwhen I remove the screen, it turns tail at once.\r\n\r\nThat a grub destined to live in the darkness, under the shelter of a\r\ncorpse, should avoid the light is only natural; the strange part is its\r\nvery perception. The maggot is blind. Its pointed fore part, which\r\nwe hesitate to call a head, bears absolutely no trace of any optical\r\napparatus; and the same with every other part of the body. There is\r\nnothing but one bare, smooth, white skin. And this sightless creature,\r\ndeprived of any special nervous points served by ocular power, is\r\nextremely sensitive to the light. Its whole skin is a sort of retina,\r\nincapable of seeing, of course, but able, at any rate, to distinguish\r\nbetween light and darkness. Under the direct rays of a searching sun,\r\nthe grub's distress could be easily explained. We ourselves; with our\r\ncoarse skin, in comparison with that of the maggot, can distinguish\r\nbetween sunshine and shadow without the help of the eyes. But, in the\r\npresent case, the problem becomes singularly complicated. The subjects\r\nof my experiment receive only the diffused light of the sky, entering my\r\nstudy through an open window; yet this tempered light frightens them out\r\nof their senses. They flee the painful apparition; they are bent upon\r\nescaping at all costs.\r\n\r\nNow what do the fugitives feel? Are they physically hurt by the chemical\r\nradiations? Are they exasperated by other radiations, known or unknown?\r\nLight still keeps many a secret hidden from us and perhaps our optical\r\nscience, by studying the maggot, might become the richer by some\r\nvaluable information. I would gladly have gone farther into the\r\nquestion, had I possessed the necessary apparatus. But I have not, I\r\nnever have had and of course I never shall have the resources which are\r\nso useful to the seeker. These are reserved for the clever people who\r\ncare more for lucrative posts than for fair truths. Let us continue,\r\nhowever, within the measure which the poverty of my means permits.\r\n\r\nWhen duly fattened, the grubs of the flesh flies go underground to\r\ntransform themselves into pupae. The burial is intended, obviously, to\r\ngive the worm the tranquillity necessary for the metamorphosis. Let us\r\nadd that another object of the descent is to avoid the importunities\r\nof the light. The maggot isolates itself to the best of its power and\r\nwithdraws from the garish day before contracting into a little keg.\r\nIn ordinary conditions, with a loose soil, it goes hardly lower than a\r\nhand's breadth down, for provision has to be made for the difficulties\r\nof the return to the surface when the insect, now full grown, is impeded\r\nby its delicate fly wings. The grub, therefore, deems itself suitably\r\nisolated at a moderate depth. Sideways, the layer that shields it from\r\nthe light is of indefinite thickness; upwards, it measures about four\r\ninches. Behind this screen reigns utter darkness, the buried one's\r\ndelight. This is capital.\r\n\r\nWhat would happen if, by an artifice, the sideward layer were nowhere\r\nthick enough to satisfy the grub? Now, this time, I have the wherewithal\r\nto solve the problem, in the shape of a big glass tube, open at both\r\nends, about three feet long and less than an inch wide. I use it to blow\r\nthe flame of hydrogen in the little chemistry lessons which I give my\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nI close one end with a cork and fill the tube with fine, dry, sifted\r\nsand. On the surface of this long column, suspended perpendicularly in a\r\ncorner of my study, I install some twenty Sarcophaga grubs, feeding\r\nthem with meat. A similar preparation is repeated in a wider jar, with\r\na mouth as broad as one's hand. When they are big enough, the grubs in\r\neither apparatus will go down to the depth that suits them. There is no\r\nmore to be done but to leave them to their own devices.\r\n\r\nThe worms at last bury themselves and harden into pupae. This is the\r\nmoment to consult the two apparatus. The jar gives me the answer which\r\nI should have obtained in the open fields. Four inches down, or\r\nthereabouts, the worms have found a quiet lodging, protected above\r\nby the layer through which they have passed and on every side by the\r\nthickness of the vessel's contents. Satisfied with the site, they have\r\nstopped there.\r\n\r\nIt is a very different matter in the tube. The least buried of the pupae\r\nare half a yard down. Others are lower still; most of them even have\r\nreached the bottom of the tube and are touching the cork stopper, an\r\ninsuperable barrier. These last, we can see, would have gone yet deeper\r\nif the apparatus had allowed them. Not one of the score of grubs has\r\nsettled at the customary halting place; all have traveled farther down\r\nthe column, until their strength gave way. In their anxious flight, they\r\nhave dug deeper and ever deeper.\r\n\r\nWhat were they flying from? The light. Above them, the column traversed\r\nforms a more than sufficient shelter; but, at the sides, the irksome\r\nsensation is still felt through a coat of earth half an inch thick\r\nif the descent is made perpendicularly. To escape the disturbing\r\nimpression, the grub therefore goes deeper and deeper, hoping to obtain\r\nlower down the rest which is denied it above. It only ceases to move\r\nwhen worn out with the effort or stopped by an obstacle.\r\n\r\nNow, in a soft diffused light, what can be the radiations capable of\r\nacting upon this lover of darkness? They are certainly not the simple\r\nluminous rays, for a screen of fine, heaped up earth, nearly half an\r\ninch in thickness, is perfectly opaque. Then, to alarm the grub, to warn\r\nit of the over proximity of the exterior and send it to mad depths\r\nin search of isolation, other radiations, known or unknown, must be\r\nrequired, radiations capable of penetrating a screen against which\r\nordinary radiations are powerless. Who knows what vistas the natural\r\nphilosophy of the maggot might open out to us? For lack of apparatus, I\r\nconfine myself to suspicions.\r\n\r\nTo go underground to a yard's depth--and farther if my tube had allowed\r\nit--is on the part of the Flesh fly's grub a vagary provoked by unkind\r\nexperiment: never would it bury itself so low down, if left to its own\r\nwisdom. A hand's breadth thickness is quite enough, is even a great deal\r\nwhen, after completing the transformation, it has to climb back to the\r\nsurface, a laborious operation absolutely resembling the task of an\r\nentombed well sinker. It will have to fight against the sand that slips\r\nand gradually fills up the small amount of empty space obtained; it\r\nwill perhaps, without crowbar or pickaxe, have to cut itself a gallery\r\nthrough something tantamount to tufa, that is to say, through earth\r\nwhich a shower has rendered compact. For the descent, the grub has its\r\nfangs; for the assent, the fly has nothing. Only that moment come into\r\nexistence, she is a weakling, with tissues still devoid of any firmness.\r\nHow does she manage to get out? We shall know by watching a few pupae\r\nplaced at the bottom of a test-tube filled with earth. The method of the\r\nFlesh flies will teach us that of the greenbottles and the other Flies,\r\nall of whom make use of the same means.\r\n\r\nEnclosed in her pupa, the nascent fly begins by bursting the lid of her\r\ncasket with a hernia which comes between her two eyes and doubles or\r\ntrebles the size of her head. This cephalic blister throbs: it swells\r\nand subsides by turns, owing to the alternate flux and reflux of the\r\nblood. It is like the piston of an hydraulic press opening and forcing\r\nback the front part of the keg.\r\n\r\nThe head makes its appearance. The hydrocephalous monster continues the\r\nplay of her forehead, while herself remaining stationary. Inside the\r\npupa, a delicate work is being performed: the casting of the white\r\nnymphal tunic. All through this operation, the hernia is still\r\nprojecting. The head is not the head of a fly, but a queer, enormous\r\nmitre, spreading at the base into two red skull caps, which are the\r\neyes. To split her cranium in the middle, shunt the two halves to the\r\nright and left and send surging through the gap a tumor which staves the\r\nbarrel with its pressure: this constitutes the Fly's eccentric method.\r\n\r\nFor what reason does the hernia, once the keg is staved, continue\r\nswollen and projecting? I take it to be a waste pocket into which\r\nthe insect momentarily forces back its reserves of blood in order to\r\ndiminish the bulk of the body to that extent and to extract it more\r\neasily from the nymphal slough and afterwards from the narrow channel\r\nof the shell. As long as the operation of the release lasts, it pushes\r\noutside all that it is able to inject of its accumulated humors; it\r\nmakes itself small inside the pupa and swells into a bloated deformity\r\nwithout. Two hours and more are spent in this laborious stripping.\r\n\r\nAt last, the fly comes into view. The wings, mere scanty stumps, hardly\r\nreach the middle of the abdomen. On the outer edge, they have a deep\r\nnotch similar to the waist of a violin. This diminishes by just so\r\nmuch the surface and the length, an excellent device for decreasing\r\nthe friction along the earthy column which has next to be scaled. The\r\nhydrocephalous one resumes her performance more vigorously than ever;\r\nshe inflates and deflates her frontal knob. The pounded sand rustles\r\ndown the insect's sides. The legs play but a secondary part. Stretched\r\nbehind, motionless, when the piston stroke is delivered, they furnish\r\na support. As the sand descends, they pile it and nimbly push it back,\r\nafter which they drag along lifelessly until the next avalanche. The\r\nhead advances each time by a length equal to that of the sand displaced.\r\nEach stroke of the frontal swelling means a step forward. In a dry,\r\nloose soil, things go pretty fast. A column six inches high is traversed\r\nin less than a quarter of an hour.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it reaches the surface, the insect, covered with dust,\r\nproceeds to make its toilet. It thrusts out the blister of its forehead\r\nfor the last time and brushes it carefully with its front tarsi. It is\r\nimportant that the little pounding engine should be carefully dusted\r\nbefore it is taken inside to form a forehead that will open no more:\r\nthis lest any grit should lodge in the head. The wings are carefully\r\nbrushed and polished; they lose their curved notches; they lengthen and\r\nspread. Then, motionless on the surface of the sand, the fly matures\r\nfully. Let us set her at liberty. She will go and join the others on the\r\nSnakes in my pans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI. THE BUMBLEBEE FLY\r\n\r\nUnderneath the wasp's brown paper manor house, the ground is channeled\r\ninto a sort of drain for the refuse of the nest. Here are shot the dead\r\nor weakly larvae which a continual inspection roots out from the cells\r\nto make room for fresh occupants; here, at the time of the autumn\r\nmassacre, are flung the backward grubs; here, lastly, lies a good part\r\nof the crowd killed by the first touch of winter. During the rack and\r\nruin of November and December, this sewer becomes crammed with animal\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nSuch riches will not remain unemployed. The world's great law which says\r\nthat nothing edible shall be wasted provides for the consumption of a\r\nmere ball of hair disgorged by the owl. How shall it be with the vast\r\nstores of a ruined wasps' nest! If they have not come yet, the consumers\r\nwhose task it is to salve this abundant wreckage for nature's markets,\r\nthey will not tarry in coming and waiting for the manna that will soon\r\ndescend from above. That public granary, lavishly stocked by death, will\r\nbecome a busy factory of fresh life. Who are the guests summoned to the\r\nbanquet?\r\n\r\nIf the wasps flew away, carrying the dead or sickly grubs with them,\r\nand dropped them on the ground round about their home, those banqueters\r\nwould be, first and foremost, the insect-eating birds, the warblers,\r\nall of whom are lovers of small game. In this connection, we will allow\r\nourselves a brief digression. We all know with what jealous intolerance\r\nthe nightingales occupy each his own cantonment. Neighborly intercourse\r\namong them is tabooed. The males frequently exchange defiant couplets at\r\na distance; but, should the challenged party draw near, the challenger\r\nmakes him clear off. Now, not far from my house, in a scanty clump of\r\nholly oaks which would barely give the woodcutter the wherewithal for\r\na dozen faggots, I used, all through the spring, to hear such\r\nfull-throated warbling of nightingales that the songs of those virtuosi,\r\nall giving voice at once and with no attempt at order, degenerated into\r\na deafening hubbub.\r\n\r\nWhy did those passionate devotees of solitude come and settle in such\r\nlarge numbers at a spot where custom decrees that there is just room\r\nenough for one household only? What reasons have made the recluse become\r\na congregation? I asked the owner of the spinney about the matter.\r\n\r\n'It's like that every year,' he said. 'The clump is overrun by\r\nNightingales.'\r\n\r\n'And the reason?'\r\n\r\n'The reason is that there is a hive close by, behind that wall.'\r\n\r\nI looked at the man in amazement, unable to understand what connection\r\nthere could be between a hive and the thronging nightingales.\r\n\r\n'Why, yes,' he added, 'there are a lot of nightingales because there are\r\na lot of bees.\r\n\r\nAnother questioning look from my side. I did not yet understand. The\r\nexplanation came: 'The bees,' he said, 'throw out their dead grubs.\r\nThe front of the hive is strewn with them in the mornings; and the\r\nnightingales come and collect them for themselves and their families.\r\nThey are very fond of them.'\r\n\r\nThis time I had solved the puzzle. Delicious food, abundant and fresh\r\neach day, had brought the songsters together. Contrary to their habit,\r\nnumbers of nightingales are living on friendly terms in a cluster of\r\nbushes, in order to be near the hive and to have a larger share in the\r\nmorning distribution of plump dainties.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, the nightingale and his gastronomical rivals would\r\nhaunt the neighborhood of the wasps' nests, if the dead grubs were cast\r\nout on the surface of the soil; but these delicacies fall inside the\r\nburrow and no little bird would dare to enter the murky cave, even if\r\nthe entrance were not too small to admit it. Other consumers are needed\r\nhere, small in size and great in daring; the fly is called for and her\r\nmaggot, the king of the departed. What the greenbottles, the bluebottles\r\nand the flesh flies do in the open air, at the expense of every kind\r\nof corpse, other flies, narrowing their province, do underground at the\r\nWasps' expense.\r\n\r\nLet us turn our attention, in September, to the wrapper of a wasps'\r\nnest. On the outer surface and there alone, this wrapper is strewn with\r\na multitude of big, white, elliptical dots, firmly fixed to the brown\r\npaper and measuring about two millimeters and a half long by one and a\r\nhalf wide. Flat below, convex above and of a lustrous white, these dots\r\nresemble very neat drops fallen from a tallow candle. Lastly, their\r\nbacks are streaked with faint transversal lines, an elegant detail\r\nperceptible only with the lens. These curious objects are scattered\r\nall over the surface of the wrapper, sometimes at a distance from one\r\nanother, sometimes gathered into more or less dense groups. They are the\r\neggs of the Volucella, or bumblebee fly (Volucella zonaria, LIN.)\r\n\r\nAlso stuck to the brown paper of the outer wrapper and mixed up with the\r\nVolucella's are a large number of other eggs, chalk white, spear-shaped\r\nand ridged lengthwise with seven or eight thin ribs, after the manner of\r\nthe seeds of certain Umbelliferae. The finishing touch to their delicate\r\nbeauty is the fine stippling all over the surface. They are smaller by\r\nhalf than the others. I have seen grubs come out of them which might\r\neasily be the earliest stage of some pointed maggots which I have\r\nalready noticed in the burrows. My attempts to rear them failed; and I\r\nam not able to say which fly these eggs belong to. Enough for us to note\r\nthe nameless one in passing. There are plenty of others, which we must\r\nmake up our minds to leave unlabelled, in view of the jumbled crowd of\r\nfeasters in the ruined wasps' nest. We will concern ourselves only with\r\nthe most remarkable, in the front rank of which stands the bumblebee\r\nFly.\r\n\r\nShe is a gorgeous and powerful fly; and her costume, with its brown\r\nand yellow bands, shows a vague resemblance to that of the wasps. Our\r\nfashionable theorists have availed themselves of this brown and yellow\r\nto cite the Volucella as a striking instance of protective mimicry.\r\nObliged, if not on her own behalf, at least on that of her family, to\r\nintroduce herself as a parasite into the wasp's home, she resorts, they\r\ntell us, to trickery and craftily dons her victim's livery. Once inside\r\nthe wasps' nest, she is taken for one of the inhabitants and attends\r\nquietly to her business.\r\n\r\nThe simplicity of the wasp, duped by a very clumsy imitation of her\r\ngarb, and the depravity of the fly, concealing her identity under a\r\ncounterfeit presentment, exceed the limits of my credulity. The wasp\r\nis not so silly nor the Volucella so clever as we are assured. If the\r\nlatter really meant to deceive the Wasp by her appearance, we must\r\nadmit that her disguise is none too successful. Yellow sashes round the\r\nabdomen do not make a wasp. It would need more than that and, above all,\r\na slender figure and a nimble carriage; and the Volucella is thickset\r\nand corpulent and sedate in her movements. Never will the wasp take that\r\nunwieldy insect for one of her own kind. The difference is too great.\r\n\r\nPoor Volucella, mimesis has not taught you enough. You ought--this is\r\nthe essential point--to have adopted a wasp's shape; and that you forgot\r\nto do: you remained a fat fly, easily recognizable. Nevertheless, you\r\npenetrate into the terrible cavern; you are able to stay there for a\r\nlong time, without danger, as the eggs profusely strewn on the wrapper\r\nof the wasps' nest show. How do you set about it?\r\n\r\nLet us, first of all, remember that the bumblebee fly does not enter the\r\nenclosure in which the combs are heaped: she keeps to the outer surface\r\nof the paper rampart and there lays her eggs. Let us, on the other hand,\r\nrecall the Polistes [a tree nesting wasp] placed in the company of the\r\nwasps in my vivarium. Here of a surety is one who need not have recourse\r\nto mimicry to find acceptance. She belongs to the guild, she is a wasp\r\nherself. Any of us that had not the trained eye of the entomologist\r\nwould confuse the two species. Well, this stranger, as long as she does\r\nnot become too importunate, is quite readily tolerated by the caged\r\nwasps. None seeks to pick a quarrel with her. She is even admitted to\r\nthe table, the strip of paper smeared with honey. But she is doomed if\r\nshe inadvertently sets foot upon the combs. Her costume, her shape, her\r\nsize, which tally almost exactly with the costume, shape and size of\r\nthe wasp, do not save her from her fate. She is at once recognized as a\r\nstranger and attacked and slaughtered with the same vigor as the larvae\r\nof the Hylotoma sawfly and the Saperda beetle, neither of which bears\r\nany outward resemblance to the larva of the wasps.\r\n\r\nSeeing that identity of shape and costume does not save the Polistes,\r\nhow will the Volucella fare, with her clumsy imitation? The wasp's eye,\r\nwhich is able to discern the dissimilar in the like, will refuse to\r\nbe caught. The moment she is recognized, the stranger is killed on the\r\nspot. As to that there is not the shadow of a doubt.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of bumblebee flies at the moment of experimenting, I\r\nemploy another fly, Milesia fulminans, who, thanks to her slim figure\r\nand her handsome yellow bands, presents a much more striking likeness to\r\nthe wasp than does the fat Volucella zonaria. Despite this resemblance,\r\nif she rashly venture on the combs, she is stabbed and slain. Her yellow\r\nsashes, her slender abdomen deceive nobody. The stranger is recognized\r\nbehind the features of a double.\r\n\r\nMy experiments under glass, which varied according to the captures which\r\nI happened to make, all lead me to this conclusion: as long as there\r\nis more propinquity, even around the honey, the other occupants are\r\ntolerated fairly well; but, if they touch the cells, they are assaulted\r\nand often killed, without distinction of shape or costume. The grubs'\r\ndormitory is the sanctum sanctorum which no outsider must enter under\r\npain of death.\r\n\r\nWith these caged captives I experiment by daylight, whereas the free\r\nwasps work in the absolute darkness of their underground retreat. Where\r\nlight is absent, color goes for nothing. Once, therefore, that she has\r\nentered the cavern, the bumblebee fly derives no benefit from her yellow\r\nbands, which are supposed to be her safeguard. Whether garbed as she is\r\nor otherwise, it is easy for her to effect her purpose in the dark, on\r\ncondition that she avoids the tumultuous interior of the wasps' nest. So\r\nlong as she has the prudence not to hustle the passers by, she can dab\r\nher eggs, without danger, on the paper wall. No one will know of her\r\npresence. The dangerous thing is to cross the threshold of the burrow\r\nin broad daylight, before the eyes of those who go in and out. At that\r\nmoment alone, protective mimicry would be convenient. Now does the\r\nentrance of the Volucella into the presence of a few wasps entail such\r\nvery great risks? The wasps' nest in my enclosure, the one which\r\nwas afterwards to perish in the sun under a bell glass, gave me the\r\nopportunity for prolonged observations, but without any result upon the\r\nsubject of my immediate concern. The bumblebee fly did not appear. The\r\nperiod for her visits had doubtless passed; for I found plenty of her\r\ngrubs when the nest was dug up.\r\n\r\nOther flies rewarded me for my assiduity. I saw some--at a respectful\r\ndistance, I need hardly say--entering the burrow. They were\r\ninsignificant in size and of a dark gray color, not unlike that of the\r\nhousefly. They had not a patch of yellow about them and certainly had no\r\nclaim to protective mimicry. Nevertheless, they went in and out as they\r\npleased, calmly, as though they were at home. As long as there was not\r\ntoo great a number at the door, the wasps left them alone. When there\r\nwas anything of a crowd, the gray visitors waited near the threshold for\r\na less busy moment. No harm came to them.\r\n\r\nInside the establishment, the same peaceful relations prevail. In\r\nthis respect I have the evidence of my excavations. In the underground\r\ncharnel house, so rich in Fly grubs, I find no corpses of adult flies.\r\nIf the strangers had been slaughtered in passing through the entrance\r\nhall, or lower down, they would fall to the bottom of the burrow anyhow,\r\nwith the other rubbish. Now in this charnel house, as I said, there are\r\nnever any dead bumblebee flies, never a fly of any sort. The incomers\r\nare respected. Having done their business, they go out unscathed.\r\n\r\nThis tolerance on the part of the wasps is surprising. And a suspicion\r\ncomes to one's mind: can it be that the Volucella and the rest are\r\nnot what the accepted theories of natural history call them, namely,\r\nenemies, grub killers sacking the wasps' nest? We will look into this\r\nby examining them when they are hatched. Nothing is easier, in September\r\nand October, than to collect the Volucella's eggs in such numbers as we\r\nplease. They abound on the outer surface of the wasps' nest. Moreover,\r\nas with the larvae of the wasp, it is some time before they are\r\nsuffocated by the petroleum fumes; and so most of them are sure to\r\nhatch. I take my scissors, cut the most densely populated bits from the\r\npaper wall of the nest and fill a jar with them. This is the warehouse\r\nfrom which I shall daily, for the best part of the next two months, draw\r\nmy supply of nascent grubs.\r\n\r\nThe Volucella's egg remains where it is, with its white color always\r\nstrongly marked against the brown of the background. The shell wrinkles\r\nand collapses; and the fore end tears open. From it there issues a\r\npretty little white grub, thin in front, swelling slightly in the\r\nrear and bristling all over with fleshy protuberances. The creature's\r\npapillae are set on its sides like the teeth of a comb; at the rear,\r\nthey lengthen and spread into a fan; on the back, they are shorter and\r\narranged in four longitudinal rows. The last section but one carries two\r\nshort, bright red breathing tubes, standing aslant and joined to each\r\nother. The fore part, near the pointed mouth, is of a darker, brownish\r\ncolor. This is the biting and motor apparatus, seen through the skin and\r\nconsisting of two fangs. Taken all round, the grub is a pretty little\r\nthing, with its bristling whiteness, which gives it the appearance of\r\na tiny snowflake. But this elegance does not last long: grown big and\r\nstrong, the bumblebee fly's grub becomes soiled with sanies, turns a\r\nrussety brown and crawls about in the guise of a hulking porcupine.\r\n\r\nWhat becomes of it when it leaves the egg? This my warehousing jar tells\r\nme, partly. Unable to keep its balance on sloping surfaces, it drops\r\nto the bottom of the receptacle, where I find it, daily, as hatched,\r\nwandering restlessly. Things must happen likewise at the wasps'.\r\nIncapable of standing on the slant of the paper wall, the newborn\r\ngrubs slide to the bottom of the underground cavity, which contains,\r\nespecially at the end of the summer, a heaped up provender of deceased\r\nwasps and dead larvae removed from the cells and flung outside the\r\nhouse, all nice and gamy, as proper maggot's food should be. The\r\nVolucella's offspring, themselves maggots, notwithstanding their\r\nsnowy apparel, find in this charnel house victuals to their liking,\r\nincessantly renewed. Their fall from the high walls might well be\r\nnot accidental, but rather a means of reaching, quickly and without\r\nsearching, the good things down at the bottom of the cavern. Perhaps,\r\nalso, some of the white grubs, thanks to the holes that make the wrapper\r\nresemble a spongy cover, manage to slip inside the Wasps' nest. Still,\r\nmost of the Volucella's grubs, at whatever stage of their development,\r\nare in the basement of the burrow, among the carrion remains. The\r\nothers, those settled in the wasps' home itself, are comparatively few.\r\n\r\nThese returns are enough to show us that the grubs of the bumblebee fly\r\ndo not deserve the bad reputation that has been given them. Satisfied\r\nwith the spoils of the dead, they do not touch the living; they do not\r\nravage the wasps' nest: they disinfect it.\r\n\r\nExperiment confirms what we have learnt in the actual nests. Over and\r\nover again, I bring wasp grubs and Volucella grubs together in small\r\ntest tubes, which are easy to observe. The first are well and strong; I\r\nhave just taken them from their cells. The others are in various stages,\r\nfrom that of the snowflake born the same day to that of the sturdy\r\nporcupine. There is nothing tragic about the encounter. The grubs of the\r\nbumblebee fly roam about the test-tube without touching the live tidbit.\r\nThe most that they do is to put their mouths for a moment to the morsel;\r\nthen they take it away again, not caring for the dish.\r\n\r\nThey want something different: a wounded, a dying grub; a corpse\r\ndissolving into sanies. Indeed, if I prick the wasp grub with a needle,\r\nthe scornful ones at once come and sup at the bleeding wound. If I give\r\nthem a dead grub, brown with putrefaction, the worms rip it open and\r\nfeast on its humors. Better still: I can feed them quite satisfactorily\r\nwith wasps that have turned putrid under their horny rings; I see them\r\ngreedily suck the juices of decomposing Rosechafer grubs; I can keep\r\nthem thriving with chopped up butcher's meat, which they know how to\r\nliquefy by the method of the common maggot. And these unprejudiced ones,\r\nwho accept anything that comes their way, provided it be dead, refuse\r\nit when it is alive. Like the true flies that they are, frank body\r\nsnatchers, they wait, before touching a morsel, for death to do its\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nInside the wasps' nest, robust grubs are the rule and weaklings the\r\nrare exception, because of the assiduous supervision which eliminates\r\nanything that is diseased and like to die. Here, nevertheless, Volucella\r\ngrubs are found, on the combs, among the busy wasps. They are not, it\r\nis true, so numerous as in the charnel house below, but still pretty\r\nfrequent. Now what do they do in this abode where there are no corpses?\r\nDo they attack the healthy? Their continual visits from cell to cell\r\nwould at first make one think so; but we shall soon be undeceived if\r\nwe observe their movements closely; and this is possible with my glass\r\nroofed colonies.\r\n\r\nI see them fussily crawling on the surface of the combs, curving their\r\nnecks from side to side and taking stock of the cells. This one does\r\nnot suit, nor that one either; the bristly creature passes on, still in\r\nsearch, thrusting its pointed fore part now here, now there. This time,\r\nthe cell appears to fulfil the requisite conditions. A larva,\r\nglowing with health, opens wide its mouth, believing its nurse to be\r\napproaching. It fills the hexagonal chamber with its bulging sides.\r\n\r\nThe gluttonous visitor bends and slides its slender fore part, a blade\r\nof exquisite suppleness, between the wall and the inhabitant, whose\r\nslack rotundity yields to the pressure of this animated wedge. It\r\nplunges into the cell, leaving no part of itself outside but its wide\r\nhind quarters, with the red dots of the two breathing tubes.\r\n\r\nIt remains in this posture for some time, occupied with its work at\r\nthe bottom of the cell. Meanwhile, the wasps present do not interfere,\r\nremain impassive, showing that the grub visited is in no peril. The\r\nstranger, in fact, withdraws with a soft, gliding motion. The chubby\r\nbabe, a sort of India rubber bag, resumes its original volume without\r\nhaving suffered any harm, as its appetite proves. A nurse offers it a\r\nmouthful, which it accepts with every sign of unimpaired vigor. As for\r\nthe Volucella grub, it licks its lips after its own fashion, pushing\r\nits two fangs in and out; then, without further loss of time, goes and\r\nrepeats its probing elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWhat it wants down there, at the bottom of the cells, behind the grubs,\r\ncannot be decided by direct observation; it must be guessed at. Since\r\nthe visited larva remains intact, it is not prey that the Volucella grub\r\nis after. Besides, if murder formed part of its plans, why descend to\r\nthe bottom of the cell, instead of attacking the defenseless recluse\r\nstraight way? It would be much easier to suck the patient's juices\r\nthrough the actual orifice of the cell. Instead of that, we see a dip,\r\nalways a dip and never any other tactics.\r\n\r\nThen what is there behind the wasp grub? Let us try to put it as\r\ndecently as possible. In spite of its exceeding cleanliness, this grub\r\nis not exempt from the physiological ills inseparable from the stomach.\r\nLike all that eats, it has intestinal waste matter with regard to which\r\nits confinement compels it to behave with extreme discretion. Like so\r\nmany other close-cabined larvae of Wasps and Bees, it waits until the\r\nmoment of the transformation to rid itself of its digestive refuse.\r\nThen, once and for all, it casts out the unclean accumulation whereof\r\nthe pupa, that delicate, reborn organism, must not retain the least\r\ntrace. This is found later, in any empty cell, in the form of a dark\r\npurple plug. But, without waiting for this final purge, this lump, there\r\nare, from time to time, slight excretions of fluid, clear as water. We\r\nhave only to keep a Wasp grub in a little glass tube to recognize these\r\noccasional discharges. Well, I see nothing else to explain the action of\r\nthe Volucella's grubs when they dip into the cells without wounding the\r\nlarvae. They are looking for this liquid, they provoke its emission.\r\nIt represents to them a dainty which they enjoy over and above the more\r\nsubstantial fare provided by the corpses.\r\n\r\nThe bumblebee fly, that sanitary inspector of the Vespine city, fulfils\r\na double office: she wipes the wasp's children and she rids the nest of\r\nits dead. For this reason, she is peacefully received, as an auxiliary,\r\nwhen she enters the burrow to lay her eggs; for this reason, her grub is\r\ntolerated, nay more, respected, in the very heart of the dwelling, where\r\nnone might stray with impunity. I remember the brutal reception given\r\nto the Saperda and Hylotoma grubs when I place them on a comb. Forthwith\r\ngrabbed, bruised and riddled with stings, the poor wretches perish. It\r\nis quite a different matter with the offspring of the Volucella.\r\nThey come and go as they please, poke about in the cells, elbow the\r\ninhabitants and remain unmolested. Let us give some instances of this\r\nclemency, which is very strange in the irascible Wasp.\r\n\r\nFor a couple of hours, I fix my attention on a Volucella grub\r\nestablished in a cell, side by side with the Wasp grub, the mistress\r\nof the house. The hind quarters emerge, displaying their papillae.\r\nSometimes also the fore part, the head, shows, bending from side to side\r\nwith sudden, snake-like motions. The wasps have just filled their crops\r\nat the honey pot; they are dispensing the rations, are very busily at\r\nwork; and things are taking place in broad daylight, on the table by the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\nAs they pass from cell to cell, the nurses repeatedly brush against and\r\nstride across the Volucella grub. There is no doubt that they see\r\nit. The intruder does not budge, or, if trodden on, curls up, only to\r\nreappear the next moment. Some of the wasps stop, bend their heads\r\nover the opening, seem to be making inquiries and then go off, without\r\ntroubling further about the state of things. One of them does something\r\neven more remarkable: she tries to give a mouthful to the lawful\r\noccupant of the cell; but the larva, which is being squeezed by its\r\nvisitor, has no appetite and refuses. Without the least sign of anxiety\r\non behalf of the nursling which she sees in awkward company, the wasp\r\nretires and goes to distribute its ration elsewhere. In vain I prolong\r\nmy examination: there is no fluster of any kind. The Volucella grub\r\nis treated as a friend, or at least as a visitor that does not matter.\r\nThere is no attempt to dislodge it, to worry it, to put it to flight.\r\nNor does the grub seem to trouble greatly about those who come and go.\r\nIts tranquillity, tells us that it feels at home.\r\n\r\nHere is some further evidence: the grub has plunged, head downwards,\r\ninto an empty cell, which is too small to contain the whole of it.\r\nIts hindquarters stick out, very visibly. For long hours, it remains\r\nmotionless in this position. At every moment, wasps pass and repass\r\nclose by. Three of them, at one time together, at another separately,\r\ncome and nibble at the edges of the cell; they break off particles which\r\nthey reduce to paste for a new piece of work. The passers by, intent\r\nupon their business, may not perceive the intruder; but these three\r\ncertainly do. During their work of demolition, they touch the grub with\r\ntheir legs, their antennae, their palpi; and yet none of them minds it.\r\nThe fat grub, so easily recognized by its queer figure, is left alone;\r\nand this in broad daylight, where everybody can see it. What must it be\r\nwhen the profound darkness of the burrows protects the visitor with its\r\nmysteries!\r\n\r\nI have been experimenting all along with big Volucella grubs, colored\r\nwith the dirty red which comes with age. What effect will pure white\r\nproduce? I sprinkle on the surface of the combs some larvae that have\r\nlately left the egg. The tiny, snow-white grubs make for the nearest\r\ncells, go down into them, come out again and hunt elsewhere. The\r\nwasps peaceably let them go their way, as heedless of the little white\r\ninvaders as of the big red ones. Sometimes, when it enters an occupied\r\ncell, the little creature is seized by the owner, the wasp grub, which\r\nnabs it and turns and returns it between its mandibles. Is this a\r\ndefensive bite? No, the wasp grub has merely blundered, taking its\r\nvisitor for a proffered mouthful. There is no great harm done. Thanks\r\nto its suppleness, the little grub emerges from the grip intact and\r\ncontinues its investigations.\r\n\r\nIt might occur to us to attribute this tolerance to some lack of\r\npenetration in the wasps' vision. What follows will undeceive us: I\r\nplace separately, in empty cells, a grub of Saperda scalaria and a\r\nVolucella grub, both of them white and selected so as not to fill the\r\ncell entirely. Their presence is revealed only by the paleness of\r\nthe hind part which serves as a plug to the opening. A superficial\r\nexamination would leave the nature of the recluse undecided. The wasps\r\nmake no mistake: they extirpate the Saperda grub, kill it, fling it on\r\nthe dust heap; they leave the Volucella grub in peace.\r\n\r\nThe two strangers are quite well recognized in the secrecy of the cells:\r\none is the intruder that must be turned out; the other is the regular\r\nvisitor that must be respected. Sight helps, for things take place in\r\nthe daylight, under glass; but the wasps have other means of information\r\nin the dimness of the burrow. When I produce darkness by covering the\r\napparatus with a screen, the murder of the trespassers is accomplished\r\njust the same. For so say the police regulations of the wasps' nest: any\r\nstranger discovered must be slain and thrown on the midden.\r\n\r\nTo thwart this vigilance, the real enemies need to be masters of the art\r\nof deceptive immobility and cunning disguise. But there is no deception\r\nabout the Volucella grub. It comes and goes, openly, wheresoever it\r\nwill; it looks round amongst the wasps for cells to suit it. What has it\r\nto make itself thus respected? Strength? Certainly not. It is a harmless\r\ncreature, which the wasp could rip open with a blow of her shears, while\r\na touch of the sting would mean lightning death. It is a familiar guest,\r\nto whom no denizen of a wasps' nest bears any ill will. Why? Because\r\nit renders good service: so far from working mischief, it does the\r\nscavenging for its hosts. Were it an enemy or merely an intruder, it\r\nwould be exterminated; as a deserving assistant, it is respected.\r\n\r\nThen what need is there for the Volucella to disguise herself as a\r\nwasp? Any fly, whether clad in drab or motley, is admitted to the burrow\r\ndirectly she makes herself useful to the community. The mimicry of the\r\nbumblebee fly, which was said to be one of the most conclusive cases,\r\nis, after all, a mere childish notion. Patient observation, continually\r\nface to face with facts, will have none of it and leaves it to the\r\narmchair naturalists, who are too prone to look at the animal world\r\nthrough the illusive mists of theory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII. MATHEMATICAL MEMORIES: NEWTON'S BINOMIAL THEOREM\r\n\r\nThe spider's web is a glorious mathematical problem. I should enjoy\r\nworking it out in all its details, were I not afraid of wearying the\r\nreader's attention. Perhaps I have even gone too far in the little that\r\nI have said, in which case I owe him some compensation: 'Would you\r\nlike me,' I will ask him, 'would you like me to tell you how I acquired\r\nsufficient algebra to master the logarithmic systems and how I became\r\na surveyor of Spiders' webs? Would you? It will give us a rest from\r\nnatural history.'\r\n\r\nI seem to catch a sign of acquiescence. The story of my village school,\r\nvisited by the chicks and the porkers, has been received with some\r\nindulgence; why should not my harsh school of solitude possess its\r\ninterest as well? Let us try to describe it. And who knows? Perhaps,\r\nin doing so, I shall revive the courage of some other poor derelict\r\nhungering after knowledge.\r\n\r\nI was denied the privilege of learning with a master. I should be wrong\r\nto complain. Solitary study has its advantages: it does not cast you in\r\nthe official mould; it leaves you all your originality. Wild fruit, when\r\nit ripens, has a different taste from hothouse produce: it leaves on\r\na discriminating palate a bittersweet flavor whose virtue is all the\r\ngreater for the contrast. Yes, if it were in my power, I would start\r\nafresh, face to face with my only counselor, the book itself, not always\r\na very lucid one; I would gladly resume my lonely watches, my struggles\r\nwith the darkness whence, at last, a glimmer appears as I continue to\r\nexplore it; I should retraverse the irksome stages of yore, stimulated\r\nby the one desire that has never failed me, the desire of learning and\r\nof afterwards bestowing my mite of knowledge on others.\r\n\r\nWhen I left the normal school, my stock of mathematics was of the\r\nscantiest. How to extract a square root, how to calculate and prove the\r\nsurface of a sphere: these represented to me the culminating points of\r\nthe subject. Those terrible logarithms, when I happened to open a\r\ntable of them, made my head swim, with their columns of figures; actual\r\nfright, not unmixed with respect, overwhelmed me on the very threshold\r\nof that arithmetical cave. Of algebra I had no knowledge whatever. I had\r\nheard the name; and the syllables represented to my poor brain the whole\r\nwhirling legion of the abstruse.\r\n\r\nBesides, I felt no inclination to decipher the alarming hieroglyphics.\r\nThey made one of those indigestible dishes which we confidently extol\r\nwithout touching them. I greatly preferred a fine line of Virgil, whom I\r\nwas now beginning to understand; and I should have been surprised\r\nindeed had any one told me that, for long years to come, I should be an\r\nenthusiastic student of the formidable science. Good fortune procured me\r\nmy first lesson in algebra, a lesson given and not received, of course.\r\n\r\nA young man of about my own age came to me and asked me to teach him\r\nalgebra. He was preparing for his examination as a civil engineer; and\r\nhe came to me because, ingenuous youth that he was, he took me for\r\na well of learning. The guileless applicant was very far out in his\r\nreckoning.\r\n\r\nHis request gave me a shock of surprise, which was forthwith repressed\r\non reflection: 'I give algebra lessons?' said I to myself. 'It would be\r\nmadness: I don't know anything about the subject!'\r\n\r\nAnd I left it at that for a moment or two, thinking hard, drawn now\r\nthis way, now that with indecision: 'Shall I accept? Shall I refuse?'\r\ncontinued the inner voice.\r\n\r\nPooh, let's accept! An heroic method of learning to swim is to\r\nleap boldly into the sea. Let us hurl ourselves head first into the\r\nalgebraical gulf; and perhaps the imminent danger of drowning will call\r\nforth efforts capable of bringing me to land. I know nothing of what\r\nhe wants. It makes no difference: let's go ahead and plunge into the\r\nmystery. I shall learn by teaching.\r\n\r\nIt was a fine courage that drove me full tilt into a province which I\r\nhad not yet thought of entering. My twenty-year-old confidence was an\r\nincomparable lever.\r\n\r\n'Very well,' I replied. 'Come the day after tomorrow, at five, and we'll\r\nbegin.'\r\n\r\nThis twenty-four hours' delay concealed a plan. It secured me the\r\nrespite of a day, the blessed Thursday, which would give me time to\r\ncollect my forces.\r\n\r\nThursday comes. The sky is gray and cold. In this horrid weather, a\r\ngrate well filled with coke has its charms. Let's warm ourselves and\r\nthink.\r\n\r\nWell, my boy, you've landed yourself in a nice predicament! How will\r\nyou manage tomorrow? With a book, plodding all through the night, if\r\nnecessary, you might scrape up something resembling a lesson, just\r\nenough to fill the dread hour more or less. Then you could see about the\r\nnext: sufficient for the day is the evil thereof. But you haven't the\r\nbook. And it's no use running out to the bookshop. Algebraical treatises\r\nare not current wares. You'll have to send for one, which will take\r\na fortnight at least. And I've promised for tomorrow, for tomorrow\r\ncertain! Another argument and one that admits of no reply: funds are\r\nlow; my last pecuniary resources lie in the corner of a drawer. I count\r\nthe money: it amounts to twelve sous, which is not enough.\r\n\r\nMust I cry off? Rather not! One resource suggests itself: a highly\r\nimproper one, I admit, not far removed indeed from larceny. O quiet\r\npaths of algebra, you are my excuse for this venial sin! Let me confess\r\nthe temporary embezzlement.\r\n\r\nLife at my college is more or less cloistered. In return for a modest\r\npayment, most of us masters are lodged in the building; and we take our\r\nmeals at the principal's table. The science master, who is the big gun\r\nof the staff and lives in the town, has nevertheless, like ourselves,\r\nhis own two cells, in addition to a balcony, or leads, where the\r\nchemical preparations give forth their suffocating gases in the open\r\nair. For this reason, he finds it more convenient to hold his class here\r\nduring the greater part of the year. The boys come to these rooms in\r\nwinter, in front of a grate stuffed full of coke, like mine, and there\r\nfind a blackboard, a pneumatic trough, a mantelpiece covered with glass\r\nreceivers, panoplies of bent tubes on the walls, and, lastly, a\r\ncertain cupboard in which I remember seeing a row of books, the oracles\r\nconsulted by the master in the course of his lessons.\r\n\r\n'Among those books,' said I to myself, 'there is sure to be one on\r\nalgebra. To ask the owner for the loan of it does not appeal to me.\r\nMy amiable colleague would receive me superciliously and laugh at my\r\nambitious aims. I am sure he would refuse my request.'\r\n\r\nThe future was to show that my distrust was justified. Narrow mindedness\r\nand petty jealousy prevail everywhere alike.\r\n\r\nI decide to help myself to this book, which I should never get by\r\nasking. This is the half-holiday. The science master will not put in an\r\nappearance today; and the key of my room is practically the same as his.\r\nI go, with eyes and ears on the alert. My key does not quite fit; it\r\nsticks a little, then goes in; and an extra effort makes it turn in\r\nthe lock. The door opens. I inspect the cupboard and find that it does\r\ncontain an algebra book, one of the big, fat books which men used to\r\nwrite in those days, a book nearly half a foot thick. My legs give way\r\nbeneath me. You poor specimen of a housebreaker, suppose you were caught\r\nat it! However, all goes well. Quick, let's lock the door again and go\r\nback to our own quarters with the pilfered volume.\r\n\r\nAnd now we are together, O mysterious tome, whose Arab name breathes a\r\nstrange mustiness of occult lore and claims kindred with the sciences of\r\nalmagest and alchemy. What will you show me? Let us turn the leaves at\r\nrandom. Before fixing one's eyes on a definite point in the landscape,\r\nit is well to take a summary view of the whole. Page follows swiftly\r\nupon page, telling me nothing. A chapter catches my attention in the\r\nmiddle of the volume; it is headed, Newton's Binomial Theorem.\r\n\r\nThe title allures me. What can a binomial theorem be, especially one\r\nwhose author is Newton, the great English mathematician who weighed the\r\nworlds? What has the mechanism of the sky to do with this? Let us read\r\nand seek for enlightenment. With my elbows on the table and my thumbs\r\nbehind my ears, I concentrate all my attention.\r\n\r\nI am seized with astonishment, for I understand! There are a certain\r\nnumber of letters, general symbols which are grouped in all manner of\r\nways, taking their places here, there and elsewhere by turns; there are,\r\nas the text tells me, arrangements, permutations and combinations.\r\nPen in hand, I arrange, permute and combine. It is a very diverting\r\nexercise, upon my word, a game in which the test of the written result\r\nconfirms the anticipations of logic and supplements the shortcomings of\r\none's thinking apparatus.\r\n\r\n'It will be plain sailing,' said I to myself, 'if algebra is no more\r\ndifficult than this.'\r\n\r\nI was to recover from the illusion later, when the binomial theorem,\r\nthat light, crisp biscuit, was followed by heavier and less\r\ndigestible fare. But, for the moment, I had no foretaste of the\r\nfuture difficulties, of the pitfall in which one becomes more and more\r\nentangled, the longer one persists in struggling. What a delightful\r\nafternoon that was, before my grate, amid my permutations and\r\ncombinations! By the evening, I had nearly mastered my subject. When the\r\nbell rang, at seven, to summon us to the common meal at the principal's\r\ntable, I went downstairs puffed up with the joys of the newly initiated\r\nneophyte. I was escorted on my way by a, b and c, intertwined in cunning\r\ngarlands.\r\n\r\nNext day, my pupil is there. Blackboard and chalk, everything is ready.\r\nNot quite so ready is the master. I bravely broach my binomial theorem.\r\nMy hearer becomes interested in the combinations of letters. Not for a\r\nmoment does he suspect that I am putting the cart before the horse and\r\nbeginning where we ought to have finished. I relieve the dryness of my\r\nexplanations with a few little problems, so many halts at which the mind\r\ntakes breath awhile and gathers strength for fresh flights.\r\n\r\nWe try together. Discreetly, so as to leave him the merit of the\r\ndiscovery, I shed a little light on the path. The solution is found. My\r\npupil triumphs; so do I, but silently, in my inner consciousness, which\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n'You understand, because you succeed in making another understand.'\r\n\r\nThe hour passed quickly and very pleasantly for both of us. My young man\r\nwas contented when he left me; and I no less so, for I perceived a new\r\nand original way of learning things.\r\n\r\nThe ingenious and easy arrangement of the binomial gave me time to\r\ntackle my algebra book from the proper commencement. In three or four\r\ndays, I had rubbed up my weapons. There was nothing to be said about\r\naddition and subtraction: they were so simple as to force themselves\r\nupon one at first sight. Multiplication spoilt things. There was a\r\ncertain rule of signs which declared that minus multiplied by minus made\r\nplus. How I toiled over that wretched paradox! It would seem that\r\nthe book did not explain this subject clearly, or rather employed too\r\nabstract a method. I read, reread and meditated in vain: the obscure\r\ntext retained all its obscurity. That is the drawback of books in\r\ngeneral: they tell you what is printed in them and nothing more. If\r\nyou fail to understand, they never advise you, never suggest an attempt\r\nalong another road which might lead you to the light. The merest word\r\nwould sometimes be enough to put you on the right track; and that word\r\nthe books, hidebound in a regulation phraseology, never give you.\r\n\r\nHow greatly preferable is the oral lesson! It goes forward, goes back,\r\nstarts afresh, walks around the obstacle and varies the methods of\r\nattack until, at long last, light is shed upon the darkness. This\r\nincomparable beacon of the master's word was what I lacked; and I went\r\nunder, without hope of succor, in that treacherous pool of the rule of\r\nsigns.\r\n\r\nMy pupil was bound to suffer the effects. After an attempt at an\r\nexplanation in which I made the most of the few gleams that reached me I\r\nasked him:\r\n\r\n'Do you understand?'\r\n\r\nIt was a futile question, but useful for gaining time. Myself not\r\nunderstanding, I was convinced beforehand that he did not understand\r\neither.\r\n\r\n'No,' he replied, accusing himself, perhaps, in his simple mind, of\r\npossessing a brain incapable of taking in those transcendental verities.\r\n\r\n'Let us try another method.'\r\n\r\nAnd I start again this way and that way and yet another way. My pupil's\r\neyes serve as my thermometer and tell me of the progress of my efforts.\r\nA blink of satisfaction announces my success. I have struck home, I have\r\nfound the joint in the armor. The product of minus multiplied by minus\r\ndelivers its mysteries to us.\r\n\r\nAnd thus we continued our studies: he, the passive receiver, taking in\r\nthe ideas acquired without effort; I, the fierce pioneer, blasting my\r\nrock, the book, with the aid of much sitting up at night, to extract the\r\ndiamond, truth. Another and no less arduous task fell to my share: I had\r\nto cut and polish the recondite gem, to strip it of its ruggedness\r\nand present it to my companion's intelligence under a less forbidding\r\naspect. This diamond cutter's work, which admitted a little light into\r\nthe precious stone, was the favorite occupation of my leisure; and I owe\r\na great deal to it.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate result was that my pupil passed his examination. As for the\r\nbook borrowed by stealth, I restored it to the shelves and replaced it\r\nby another, which, this time, belonged to me.\r\n\r\nAt my normal school, I had learnt a little elementary geometry under\r\na master. From the first few lessons onwards, I rather enjoyed the\r\nsubject. I divined in it a guide for one's reasoning faculties through\r\nthe thickets of the imagination; I caught a glimpse of a search after\r\ntruth that did not involve too much stumbling on the way, because each\r\nstep forward rests solidly upon the step already taken; I suspected\r\ngeometry to be what it preeminently is: a school of intellectual\r\nfencing.\r\n\r\nThe truth demonstrated and its application matter little to me; what\r\nrouses my enthusiasm is the process that sets the truth before us.\r\nWe start from a brilliantly lighted spot and gradually get deeper and\r\ndeeper in the darkness, which, in its turn, becomes self-illuminated by\r\nkindling new lights for a higher ascent. This progressive march of\r\nthe known toward the unknown, this conscientious lantern lighting what\r\nfollows by the rays of what comes before: that was my real business.\r\n\r\nGeometry was to teach me the logical progression of thought; it was\r\nto tell me how the difficulties are broken up into sections which,\r\nelucidated consecutively, together form a lever capable of moving the\r\nblock that resists any direct efforts; lastly, it showed me how order is\r\nengendered, order, the base of clarity. If it has ever fallen to my lot\r\nto write a page or two which the reader has run over without excessive\r\nfatigue, I owe it, in great part, to geometry, that wonderful teacher\r\nof the art of directing one's thought. True, it does not bestow\r\nimagination, a delicate flower blossoming none knows how and unable to\r\nthrive on every soil; but it arranges what is confused, thins out the\r\ndense, calms the tumultuous, filters the muddy and gives lucidity, a\r\nsuperior product to all the tropes of rhetoric.\r\n\r\nYes, as a toiler with the pen, I owe much to it. Wherefore my thoughts\r\nreadily turn back to those bright hours of my novitiate, when, retiring\r\nto a corner of the garden in recreation time, with a bit of paper on my\r\nknees and a stump of pencil in my fingers, I used to practice deducing\r\nthis or that property correctly from an assemblage of straight lines.\r\nThe others amused themselves all around me; I found my delight in the\r\nfrustum of a pyramid. Perhaps I should have done better to strengthen\r\nthe muscles of my thighs by jumping and leaping, to increase the\r\nsuppleness of my loins with gymnastic contortions. I have known some\r\ncontortionists who have prospered beyond the thinker.\r\n\r\nSee me then entering the lists as an instructor of youth, fairly well\r\nacquainted with the elements of geometry. In case of need, I could\r\nhandle the land surveyor's stake and chain. There my views ended. To\r\ncube the trunk of a tree, to gauge a cask, to measure the distance of an\r\ninaccessible point appeared to me the highest pitch to which geometrical\r\nknowledge could hope to soar. Were there loftier flights? I did not even\r\nsuspect it, when an unexpected glimpse showed me the puny dimensions of\r\nthe little corner which I had cleared in the measureless domain.\r\n\r\nAt that time, the college in which, two years before, I had made my\r\nfirst appearance as a teacher, had just halved the size of its classes\r\nand largely increased its staff. The newcomers all lived in the\r\nbuilding, like myself, and we had our meals in common at the principal's\r\ntable. We formed a hive where, in our leisure time, some of us, in our\r\nrespective cells, worked up the honey of algebra and geometry, history\r\nand physics, Greek and Latin most of all, sometimes with a view to the\r\nclass above, sometimes and oftener with a view to acquiring a degree.\r\nThe university titles lacked variety. All my colleagues were bachelors\r\nof letters, but nothing more. They must, if possible, arm themselves\r\na little better to make their way in the world. We all worked hard and\r\nsteadily. I was the youngest of the industrious community and no less\r\neager than the rest to increase my modest equipment.\r\n\r\nVisits between the different rooms were frequent. We would come to\r\nconsult one another about a difficulty, or simply to pass the time\r\nof day. I had as a neighbor, in the next cell to mine, a retired\r\nquartermaster who, weary of barrack life, had taken refuge in education.\r\nWhen in charge of the books of his company he had become more or less\r\nfamiliar with figures; and it became his ambition to take a mathematical\r\ndegree. His cerebrum appears to have hardened while he was with his\r\nregiment. According to my dear colleagues, those amiable retailers\r\nof the misfortunes of others, he had already twice been plucked.\r\nStubbornly, he returned to his books and exercises, refusing to be\r\ndaunted by two reverses.\r\n\r\nIt was not that he was allured by the beauties of mathematics, far from\r\nit; but the step to which he aspired favored his plans. He hoped to\r\nhave his own boarders and dispense butter and vegetables to lucrative\r\npurpose. The lover of study for its own sake and the persistent trapper\r\nhunting a diploma as he would something to put in his mouth were not\r\nmade to understand or to see much of each other. Chance, however,\r\nbrought us together.\r\n\r\nI had often surprised our friend sitting in the evening, by the light of\r\na candle, with his elbows on the table and his head between his hands,\r\nmeditating at great length in front of a big exercise book crammed with\r\ncabalistic signs. From time to time, when an idea came to him, he would\r\ntake his pen and hastily put down a line of writing wherein letters,\r\nlarge and small, were grouped without any grammatical sense. The letters\r\nx and y often recurred, intermingled with figures. Every row ended\r\nwith the sign of equality and a nought. Next came more reflection, with\r\nclosed eyes, and a fresh row of letters arranged in a different order\r\nand likewise followed by a nought. Page after page was filled in this\r\nqueer fashion, each line winding up with 0.\r\n\r\n'What are you doing with all those rows of figures amounting to zero?' I\r\nasked him one day.\r\n\r\nThe mathematician gave me a leery look, picked up in barracks. A\r\nsarcastic droop in the corner of his eye showed how he pitied my\r\nignorance. My colleague of the many noughts did not, however, take an\r\nunfair advantage of his superiority. He told me that he was working at\r\nanalytical geometry.\r\n\r\nThe phrase had a strange effect upon me. I ruminated silently to this\r\npurpose: there was a higher geometry, which you learnt more particularly\r\nwith combinations of letters in which x and y played a prominent part.\r\nWhen my next-door neighbor reflected so long, clutching his forehead\r\nbetween his hands, he was trying to discover the hidden meaning of his\r\nown hieroglyphics; he saw the ghostly translation of his sums dancing in\r\nspace. What did he perceive? How would the alphabetical signs, arranged\r\nfirst in one and then in another manner, give an image of the actual\r\nthings, an image visible to the eyes of the mind alone? It beat me.\r\n\r\n'I shall have to learn analytical geometry some day,' I said. 'Will you\r\nhelp me?'\r\n\r\n'I'm quite willing,' he replied, with a smile in which I read his lack\r\nof confidence in my determination.\r\n\r\nNo matter; we struck a bargain that same evening. We would together\r\nbreak up the stubble of algebra and analytical geometry, the foundation\r\nof the mathematical degree; we would make common stock: he would bring\r\nlong hours of calculation, I my youthful ardor. We would begin as soon\r\nas I had finished with my arts degree, which was my main preoccupation\r\nfor the moment.\r\n\r\nIn those far off days it was the rule to make a little serious literary\r\nstudy take precedence of science. You were expected to be familiar\r\nwith the great minds of antiquity, to converse with Horace and Virgil,\r\nTheocritus and Plato, before touching the poisons of chemistry or the\r\nlevers of mechanics. The niceties of thought could only be the gainers\r\nby these preparations. Life's exigencies, ever harsher as progress\r\nafflicts us with its increasing needs, have changed all that. A fig for\r\ncorrect language! Business before all!\r\n\r\nThis modern hurry would have suited my impatience. I confess that I\r\nfumed against the regulation which forced Latin and Greek upon me before\r\nallowing me to open up relations with the sine and cosine. Today, wiser,\r\nripened by age and experience, I am of a different opinion. I very much\r\nregret that my modest literary studies were not more carefully conducted\r\nand further prolonged. To fill up this enormous blank a little, I\r\nrespectfully returned, somewhat late in life, to those good old books\r\nwhich are usually sold second-hand with their leaves hardly cut.\r\nVenerable pages, annotated in pencil during the long evenings of my\r\nyouth, I have found you again and you are more than ever my friends. You\r\nhave taught me that an obligation rests upon whoever wields the pen: he\r\nmust have something to say that is capable of interesting us. When\r\nthe subject comes within the scope of natural science, the interest is\r\nnearly always assured; the difficulty, the great difficulty, is to prune\r\nit of its thorns and to present it under a prepossessing aspect. Truth,\r\nthey say, rises naked from a well. Agreed; but admit that she is all\r\nthe better for being decently clothed. She craves, if not the gaudy\r\nfurbelows borrowed from rhetoric's wardrobe, at least a vine leaf. The\r\ngeometers alone have the right to refuse her that modest garment; in\r\ntheorems, plainness suffices. The others, especially the naturalist, are\r\nin duty bound to drape a gauze tunic more or less elegantly around her\r\nwaist.\r\n\r\nSuppose I say: 'Baptiste, give me my slippers.'\r\n\r\nI am expressing myself in plain language, a little poor in variants. I\r\nknow exactly what I am saying and my speech is understood.\r\n\r\nOthers--and they are numerous--contend that this rudimentary method is\r\nthe best in all things. They talk science to their readers as they might\r\ntalk slippers to Baptiste. Kaffir syntax does not shock them. Do not\r\nspeak to them of the value of a well selected term, set down in its\r\nright place, still less of a lilting construction, sounding rather well.\r\nChildish nonsense they call all that; the fiddling of a short sighted\r\nmind!\r\n\r\nPerhaps they are right: the Baptiste idiom is a great economizer of time\r\nand trouble. This advantage does not tempt me; it seems to me that\r\nan idea stands out better if expressed in lucid language, with sober\r\nimagery. A suitable phrase, placed in its correct position and saying\r\nwithout fuss the things we want to say, necessitates a choice, an often\r\nlaborious choice. There are drab words, the commonplaces of colloquial\r\nspeech; and there are, so to speak, colored words, which may be compared\r\nwith the brushstrokes strewing patches of light over the gray background\r\nof a painting. How are we to find those picturesque words, those\r\nstriking features which arrest the attention? How are we to group them\r\ninto a language heedful of syntax and not displeasing to the ear?\r\n\r\nI was taught nothing of this art. For that matter, is it ever taught\r\nin the schools? I greatly doubt it. If the fire that runs through our\r\nveins, if inspiration do not come to our aid, we shall flutter the pages\r\nof the thesaurus in vain: the word for which we seek will refuse to\r\ncome. Then to what masters shall we have recourse to quicken and develop\r\nthe humble germ that is latent within us? To books.\r\n\r\nAs a boy, I was always an ardent reader; but the niceties of a\r\nwell-balanced style hardly interested me: I did not understand them. A\r\ngood deal later, when close upon fifteen, I began vaguely to see that\r\nwords have a physiognomy of their own. Some pleased me better than\r\nothers by the distinctness of their meaning and the resonance of their\r\nrhythm; they produced a clearer image in my mind; after their fashion,\r\nthey gave me a picture of the object described. Colored by its adjective\r\nand vivified by its verb, the name became a living reality: what it said\r\nI saw. And thus, gradually, was the magic of words revealed to me, when\r\nthe chances of, my undirected reading placed a few easy standard pages\r\nin my way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII. MATHEMATICAL MEMORIES: MY LITTLE TABLE\r\n\r\nIt is time to start our analytical geometry. He can come now, my\r\npartner, the mathematician: I think I shall understand what he says.\r\nI have already run through my book and noticed that our subject, whose\r\nbeautiful precision makes work a recreation, bristles with no very\r\nserious difficulties.\r\n\r\nWe begin in my room, in front of a blackboard. After a few evenings,\r\nprolonged into the peaceful watches of the night, I become aware, to my\r\ngreat surprise, that my teacher, the past master in those hieroglyphics,\r\nis really, more often than not, my pupil. He does not see the\r\ncombinations of the abscissas and ordinates very clearly. I make bold\r\nto take the chalk in hand myself, to seize the rudder of our algebraical\r\nboat. I comment on the book, interpret it in my own fashion, expound the\r\ntext, sound the reefs until daylight comes and leads us to the haven of\r\nthe solution. Besides, the logic is so irresistible, it is all such easy\r\ngoing and so lucid that often one seems to be remembering rather than\r\nlearning.\r\n\r\nAnd so we proceed, with our positions reversed. I dig into the hard\r\nrock, crumble it, loosen it until I make room for thought to penetrate.\r\nMy comrade--I can now allow myself to speak of him on equal terms--my\r\ncomrade listens, suggests objections, raises difficulties which we try\r\nto solve in unison. The two combined levers, inserted in the fissure,\r\nend by shaking and overturning the rocky mass.\r\n\r\nI no longer see in the corner of the quartermaster's eye the leery\r\ndroop that greeted me at the start. Cordial frankness now reigns, the\r\ninfectious high spirits imparted by success. Little by little, dawn\r\nbreaks, very misty as yet, but laden with promises. We are both greatly\r\namazed; and my share in the satisfaction is a double one, for he sees\r\ntwice over who makes others see. Thus do we pass half the night, in\r\ndelightful hours. We cease when sleep begins to weigh too heavily on our\r\neyelids.\r\n\r\nWhen my comrade returns to his room, does he sleep, careless for the\r\nmoment of the shifting scene which we have conjured up? He confesses to\r\nme that he sleeps soundly. This advantage I do not possess. It is not\r\nin my power to pass the sponge over my poor brain even as I pass it\r\nover the blackboard. The network of ideas remains and forms as it were a\r\nmoving cobweb in which repose wriggles and tosses, incapable of finding\r\na stable equilibrium. When sleep does come at last, it is often but a\r\nstate of somnolence which, far from suspending the activity of the mind,\r\nactually maintains and quickens it more than waking would. During this\r\ntorpor, in which night has not yet closed upon the brain, I sometimes\r\nsolve mathematical difficulties with which I struggled unsuccessfully\r\nthe day before. A brilliant beacon, of which I am hardly conscious,\r\nflares in my brain. Then I jump out of bed, light my lamp again and\r\nhasten to jot down my solutions, the recollection of which I should\r\nhave lost on awakening. Like lightning flashes, those gleams vanish as\r\nsuddenly as they appear.\r\n\r\nWhence do they come? Probably from a habit which I acquired very early\r\nin life: to have food always there for my mind, to pour the never\r\nfailing oil constantly into the lamp of thought. Would you succeed in\r\nthe things of the mind? The infallible method is to be always thinking\r\nof them. This method I practiced more sedulously than my comrade; and\r\nhence, no doubt, arose the interchange of positions, the disciple turned\r\ninto the master. It was not, however, an overwhelming infatuation, a\r\npainful obsession; it was rather a recreation, almost a poetic feast. As\r\nour great lyric writer put it in the preface to his volume, Les Rayons\r\net les ombres: 'Mathematics play their part in art as well as in\r\nscience. There is algebra in astronomy: astronomy is akin to poetry;\r\nthere is algebra in music: music is akin to poetry.'\r\n\r\nIs this poetic exaggeration? Surely not: Victor Hugo spoke truly.\r\nAlgebra, the poem of order, has magnificent flights. I look upon its\r\nformulae, its strophes as superb, without feeling at all astonished when\r\nothers do not agree. My colleague's satirical look came back when I was\r\nimprudent enough to confide my extrageometrical raptures to his ears:\r\n'Nonsense,' said he, 'pure stuff and nonsense! Let's get on with our\r\ntangents.'\r\n\r\nThe quartermaster was right: the strict severity of our approaching\r\nexamination allowed of no such dreamer's outbursts. Was I, on my side,\r\nvery wrong? To warm chill calculation by the fire of the ideal, to\r\nlift one's thought above mere formulae, to brighten the caverns of\r\nthe abstract with a spark of life: was this not to ease the effort\r\nof penetrating the unknown? Where my comrade plodded on, scorning my\r\nviaticum, I performed a journey of pleasure. If I had to lean on the\r\nrude staff of algebra, I had for my guide that voice within me, urging\r\nme to lofty flights. Study became a joy.\r\n\r\nIt became still more interesting when, after the angularities of a\r\ncombination of straight lines, I learnt to portray the graces of a\r\ncurve. How many properties were there of which the compass knew nothing,\r\nhow many cunning laws lay contained in embryo within an equation, the\r\nmysterious nut which must be artistically cracked to extract the rich\r\nkernel, the theorem! Take this or that term, place the + sign before it\r\nand forthwith you have the ellipse, the trajectory of the planets,\r\nwith its two friendly foci, transmitting pairs of vectors whose sum\r\nis constant; substitute the--sign and you have the hyperbola with\r\nthe antagonistic foci, the desperate curve that dives into space with\r\ninfinite tentacles, approaching nearer and nearer to straight lines, the\r\nasymptotes, but never succeeding in meeting them. Suppress that term and\r\nyou have the parabola, which vainly seeks in infinity its lost second\r\nfocus; you have the trajectory of the bombshell; you have the path of\r\ncertain comets which come one day to visit our sun and then flee to\r\ndepths whence they never return. Is it not wonderful thus to formulate\r\nthe orbit of the worlds? I thought so then and I think so still.\r\n\r\nAfter fifteen months of this exercise, we went up together for our\r\nexamination at Montpellier; and both of us received our degrees as\r\nbachelors of mathematical science. My companion was a wreck: I, on the\r\nother hand, had refreshed myself with analytical geometry.\r\n\r\nUtterly worn out by his course of conic sections, my chum declares that\r\nhe has had enough. In vain I hold out the glittering prospect of a new\r\ndegree, that of licentiate of mathematical science, which would lead\r\nus to the splendors of the higher mathematics and initiate us into the\r\nmechanics of the heavens: I cannot prevail upon him, cannot make him\r\nshare my audacity. He calls it a mad scheme, which will exhaust us and\r\ncome to nothing. Without the advice of an experienced pilot, with no\r\nother compass than a book, which is not always very clear, because of\r\nits laconic adherence to set terms, our poor bark is bound to be wrecked\r\non the first reef. One might as well put out to sea in a nutshell and\r\ndefy the billows of the vasty deep. He does not use these actual words,\r\nbut his gloomy estimate of the extreme difficulties to be encountered is\r\nenough to explain his refusal. I am quite free to go and break my neck\r\nin far countries; he is more prudent and will not follow me.\r\n\r\nI suspect another reason, which the deserter does not confess. He has\r\nobtained the title needed for his plans. What does he care for the rest?\r\nIs it worth while to sit up late at night and wear one's self out in\r\ntoil for the mere pleasure of learning? He must be a madman who, without\r\nthe lure of profit, lends an ear to the blandishments of knowledge. Let\r\nus retreat into our shell, close our lid to the importunities of the\r\nlight and lead the life of a mussel. There lies the secret of happiness.\r\nThis philosophy is not mine. My curiosity sees in a stage accomplished\r\nno more than the preparation for a new stage towards the retreating\r\nunknown. My partner, therefore, leaves me. Henceforth, I am alone, alone\r\nand wretched. There is no one left with whom I can sit up and thresh\r\nthe subject out in exhilarating discussion. There is no one near me to\r\nunderstand me, no one who can even passively oppose his ideas to mine\r\nand take part in the conflict whence the light will spring, even as a\r\nspark is born of the concussion of two flints. When a difficulty arises,\r\nsteep as a cliff, there is no friendly shoulder to support me in my\r\nattempt to climb it. Alone, I have to cling to the roughness of the\r\njagged rock, to fall, often, and pick myself up, covered with bruises,\r\nand renew the assault; alone, I must give my shout of triumph, without\r\nthe least echo of encouragement, when, reaching the summit and broken in\r\nthe effort, I am at last allowed to see a little way beyond.\r\n\r\nMy mathematical campaign will cost me much stubborn thought: I am aware\r\nof this after the first few lines of my book. I am entering upon the\r\ndomain of the abstract, rough ground that can only be cleared by the\r\ninsistent plow of reflection. The blackboard, excellent for the curves\r\nof analytical geometry studied in my friend's company, is now neglected.\r\nI prefer the exercise book, a quire of paper bound in a cover. With this\r\nconfidant, which allows one to remain seated and rests the muscles of\r\nthe legs, I can commune nightly under my lampshade, until a late hour,\r\nand keep going the forge of thought wherein the intractable problem is\r\nsoftened and hammered into shape.\r\n\r\nMy study table, the size of a pocket handkerchief, occupied on the right\r\nby the ink stand--a penny bottle--and on the left by the open exercise\r\nbook, gives me just the room which I need to wield the pen. I love that\r\nlittle piece of furniture, one of the first acquisitions of my early\r\nmarried life. It is easily moved where you wish: in front of the window,\r\nwhen the sky is cloudy; into the discreet light of a corner, when\r\nthe sun is troublesome. In winter, it allows you to come close to the\r\nhearth, where a log is blazing.\r\n\r\nPoor little walnut board, I have been faithful to you for half a century\r\nand more. Ink-stained, cut and scarred with the penknife, you lend\r\nyour support today to my prose as you once did to my equations. This\r\nvariation in employment leaves you indifferent; your patient back\r\nextends the same welcome to the formulae of algebra and the formula of\r\nthought. I cannot boast this placidity; I find that the change has not\r\nincreased my peace of mind; hunting for ideas troubles the brain even\r\nmore than hunting for the roots of an equation.\r\n\r\nYou would never recognize me, little friend, if you could give a glance\r\nat my gray mane. Where is the cheerful face of former days, bright with\r\nenthusiasm and hope? I have aged, I have aged. And you, what a falling\r\noff, since you came to me from the dealer's, gleaming and polished and\r\nsmelling so good with your beeswax! Like your master, you have wrinkles,\r\noften my work, I admit; for how many times, in my impatience, have I not\r\ndug my pen into you, when, after its dip in the muddy inkpot, the nib\r\nrefused to write decently!\r\n\r\nOne of your corners is broken off; the boards are beginning to\r\ncome loose. Inside you, I hear, from time to time, the plane of\r\nthe death-watch, who despoils old furniture. From year to year, new\r\ngalleries are excavated, endangering your solidity. The old ones show on\r\nthe outside in the shape of tiny round holes. A stranger has seized\r\nupon the latter, excellent quarters, obtained without trouble. I see the\r\nimpudent intruder run nimbly under my elbow and penetrate forthwith into\r\nthe tunnel abandoned by the death-watch. She is after game, this slender\r\nhuntress, clad in black, busy collecting wood lice for her grubs. A\r\nwhole nation is devouring you, you old table; I am writing on a swarm of\r\ninsects! No support could be more appropriate to my entomological notes.\r\n\r\nWhat will become of you when your master is gone? Will you be knocked\r\ndown for a franc, when the family come to apportion my poor spoils? Will\r\nyou be turned into a stand for the pitcher beside the kitchen sink?\r\nWill you be the plank on which the cabbages are shredded? Or will my\r\nchildren, on the contrary, agree and say:\r\n\r\n'Let us preserve the relic. It was where he toiled so hard to teach\r\nhimself and make himself capable of teaching others; it was where he so\r\nlong consumed his strength to find food for us when we were little. Let\r\nus keep the sacred plank.'\r\n\r\nI dare not believe in such a future for you. You will pass into strange\r\nhands, O my old friend; you will become a bedside table, laden with bowl\r\nafter bowl of linseed tea, until, decrepit, rickety and broken down, you\r\nare chopped up to feed the flames for a brief moment under the simmering\r\nsaucepan. You will vanish in smoke to join my labors in that other\r\nsmoke, oblivion, the ultimate resting place of our vain agitations.\r\n\r\nBut let us return, little table, to our young days; those of your\r\nshining varnish and of my fond illusions. It is Sunday, the day of rest,\r\nthat is to say, of continuous work, uninterrupted by my duties in the\r\nschool. I greatly prefer Thursday, which is not a general holiday\r\nand more propitious to studious calm. Such as it is, for all its\r\ndistractions, the Lord's day gives me a certain leisure. Let us make the\r\nmost of it. There are fifty-two Sundays in the year, making a total that\r\nis almost equivalent to the long vacation.\r\n\r\nIt so happens that I have a glorious question to wrestle with today;\r\nthat of Kepler's three laws, which, when explored by the calculus, are\r\nto show me the fundamental mechanism of the heavenly bodies. One of them\r\nsays: 'The area swept out in a given time by the radius vector of the\r\npath of a planet is proportional to the time taken.'\r\n\r\nFrom this I have to deduce that the force which confines the planet\r\nto its orbit is directed towards the sun. Gently entreated by the\r\ndifferential and integral calculus, already the formula is beginning to\r\nvoice itself. My concentration redoubles, my mind is set upon seizing\r\nthe radiant dawn of truth.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, in the distance, br-r-r-rum! Br-r-r-rum! Br-r-r-rum! The noise\r\ncomes nearer, grows louder. Woe upon me! And plague take the Pagoda!\r\n\r\nLet me explain. I live in a suburb, at the beginning of the Pernes Road,\r\nfar from the tumult of the town [of Carpentras where Fabre was a master\r\nat the college]. Twenty yards in front of my house, some pleasure\r\ngardens have been opened, bearing a signboard inscribed, 'The Pagoda.'\r\nHere, on Sunday afternoons, the lads and lasses from the neighboring\r\nfarms come to disport themselves in country dances. To attract custom\r\nand push the sale of refreshments, the proprietor of the ball ends\r\nthe Sunday hop with a tombola. Two hours beforehand, he has the prizes\r\ncarried along the public roads, preceded by fifes and drums. From a\r\nberibboned pole, borne by a stalwart fellow in a red sash, dangle a\r\nplated goblet, a handkerchief of Lyons silk, a pair of candlesticks and\r\nsome packets of cigars. Who would not enter the pleasure gardens, with\r\nsuch a bait?\r\n\r\n'Br-r-r-rum! Br-r-r-rum! Br-r-r-rum!' goes the procession.\r\n\r\nIt comes just under my window, wheels to the right and marches into the\r\nestablishment, a huge wooden booth, hung with evergreens. And now, if\r\nyou dislike noise, flee, flee as far as you can. Until nightfall, the\r\nophicleides will bellow, the fifes tootle and the cornets bray. How\r\nwould you deduce the steps of Kepler's laws to the accompaniment of that\r\nnoisy orchestra! It is enough to drive one mad. Let us be off with all\r\nspeed.\r\n\r\nA mile away, I know a flinty waste beloved of the wheatear and the\r\nlocust. Here reigns perfect calm; moreover, there are some clumps of\r\nevergreen oak which will lend me their scanty shade. I take my book,\r\na few sheets of paper and a pencil and fly to this solitude. What\r\nbeauteous silence, what exquisite quiet! But the sun is overwhelming,\r\nunder the meager cover of the bushes. Cheerily, my lad! Have at your\r\nKepler's laws in the company of the blue-winged locusts. You will return\r\nhome with your problems solved, but with a blistered skin. An overdose\r\nof sun in the neck shall be the outcome of grasping the law of the\r\nareas. One thing makes up for another.\r\n\r\nDuring the rest of the week, I have my Thursdays and the evenings, which\r\nI employ in study until I drop with sleep. All told I have no lack of\r\ntime, despite the drudgery of my college ties. The great thing is not\r\nto be discouraged by the unavoidable difficulties encountered at\r\nthe outset. I lose my way easily in that dense forest overgrown with\r\ncreepers that have to be cut away with the axe to obtain a clearing. A\r\nfortunate turn or two; and I once more know where I am. I lose my way\r\nagain. The stubborn axe makes its opening without always letting in\r\nsufficient light.\r\n\r\nThe book is just a book, that is to say, a set text, saying not a word\r\nmore than it is obliged to, exceedingly learned, I admit, but,\r\nalas, often obscure! The author, it seems, wrote it for himself. He\r\nunderstood; therefore others must. Poor beginners, left to yourselves,\r\nyou manage as best you can! For you, there shall be no retracing of\r\nsteps in order to tackle the difficulty in another way; no circuit\r\neasing the arduous road and preparing the passage; no supplementary\r\naperture to admit a glimmer of daylight. Incomparably inferior to the\r\nspoken word, which begins again with fresh methods of attack and is\r\nready to vary the paths that lead to the open, the book says what it\r\nsays and nothing more. Having finished its demonstration, whether you\r\nunderstand or no, the oracle is inexorably dumb. You reread the text and\r\nponder it obstinately; you pass and repass your shuttle through the woof\r\nof figures. Useless efforts all: the darkness continues. What would be\r\nneeded to supply the illuminating ray? Often enough, a trifle, a mere\r\nword; and that word the book will not speak.\r\n\r\nHappy is he who is guided by a master's teaching! His progress does not\r\nknow the misery of those wearisome breakdowns. What was I to do before\r\nthe disheartening wall that every now and then rose up and barred\r\nmy road? I followed d'Alembert's precept in his advice to young\r\nmathematical students: 'Have faith and go ahead,' said the great\r\ngeometrician.\r\n\r\nFaith I had; and I went on pluckily. And it was well for me that I did,\r\nfor I often found behind the wall the enlightenment which I was seeking\r\nin front of it. Giving up the bad patch as hopeless, I would go on and,\r\nafter I had left it behind, discover the dynamite capable of blasting\r\nit. 'Twas a tiny grain at first, an insignificant ball rolling and\r\nincreasing as it went. From one slope to the other of the theorems, it\r\ngrew to a heavy mass; and the mass became a mighty projectile which,\r\nflung backwards and retracing its course, split the darkness and spread\r\nit into one vast sheet of light.\r\n\r\nD'Alembert's precept is good and very good, provided you do not abuse\r\nit. Too much precipitation in turning over the intractable page might\r\nexpose you to many a disappointment. You must have fought the difficulty\r\ntooth and nail before abandoning it. This rough skirmishing leads to\r\nintellectual vigor.\r\n\r\nTwelve months of meditation in the company of my little table at last\r\nwon me my degree as a licentiate of mathematical science; and I was\r\nnow qualified to perform, half a century later, the eminently lucrative\r\nfunctions of an inspector of Spiders' webs!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV. THE BLUEBOTTLE: THE LAYING\r\n\r\nTo purge the earth of death's impurities and cause deceased animal\r\nmatter to be once more numbered among the treasures of life there\r\nare hosts of sausage queens, including, in our part of the world, the\r\nbluebottle (Calliphora vomitaria, LIN.) and the checkered flesh fly\r\n(Sarcophaga carnaria, LIN.). Every one knows the first, the big,\r\ndark-blue fly who, after effecting her designs in the ill-watched meat\r\nsafe, settles on our window panes and keeps up a solemn buzzing, anxious\r\nto be off in the sun and ripen a fresh emission of germs. How does\r\nshe lay her eggs, the origin of the loathsome maggot that battens\r\npoisonously on our provisions, whether of game or butcher's meat? What\r\nare her stratagems and how can we foil them? This is what I propose to\r\ninvestigate.\r\n\r\nThe bluebottle frequents our homes during autumn and a part of winter,\r\nuntil the cold becomes severe; but her appearance in the fields dates\r\nback much earlier. On the first fine day in February, we shall see her\r\nwarming herself, chillily, against the sunny walls. In April, I notice\r\nher in considerable numbers on the laurestinus. It is here that she\r\nseems to pair, while sipping the sugary exudations of the small white\r\nflowers. The whole of the summer season is spent out of doors, in brief\r\nflights from one refreshment bar to the next. When autumn comes, with\r\nits game, she makes her way into our houses and remains until the hard\r\nfrosts.\r\n\r\nThis suits my stay-at-home habits and especially my legs, which are\r\nbending under the weight of years. I need not run after the subjects of\r\nmy present study; they call on me. Besides, I have vigilant assistants.\r\nThe household knows of my plans. Every one brings me, in a little screw\r\nof paper, the noisy visitor just captured against the panes.\r\n\r\nThus do I fill my vivarium, which consists of a large, bell-shaped\r\ncage of wire gauze, standing in an earthenware pan full of sand. A\r\nmug containing honey is the dining room of the establishment. Here the\r\ncaptives come to recruit themselves in their hours of leisure. To\r\noccupy their maternal cares, I employ small birds--chaffinches, linnets,\r\nsparrows--brought down, in the enclosure, by my son's gun.\r\n\r\nI have just served up a Linnet shot two days ago. I next place in the\r\ncage a bluebottle, one only, to avoid confusion. Her fat belly proclaims\r\nthe advent of a laying time. An hour later, when the excitement of being\r\nput in prison is allayed, my captive is in labor. With eager, jerky\r\nsteps, she explores the morsel of game, goes from the head to the tail,\r\nreturns from the tail to the head, repeats the action several times and\r\nat last settles near an eye, a dimmed eye sunk into its socket.\r\n\r\nThe ovipositor bends at a right angle and dives into the junction of the\r\nbeak, straight down to the root. Then the eggs are emitted for nearly\r\nhalf an hour. The layer, utterly absorbed in her serious business,\r\nremains stationary and impassive and is easily observed through my lens.\r\nA movement on my part would doubtless scare her; but my restful presence\r\ngives her no anxiety. I am nothing to her.\r\n\r\nThe discharge does not go on continuously until the ovaries are\r\nexhausted; it is intermittent and performed in so many packets. Several\r\ntimes over, the fly leaves the bird's beak and comes to take a rest upon\r\nthe wire gauze, where she brushes her hind legs one against the other.\r\nIn particular, before using it again, she cleans, smoothes and polishes\r\nher laying tool, the probe that places the eggs. Then, feeling her womb\r\nstill teeming, she returns to the same spot at the joint of the beak.\r\nThe delivery is resumed, to cease presently and then begin anew. A\r\ncouple of hours are thus spent in alternate standing near the eye and\r\nresting on the wire gauze.\r\n\r\nAt last, it is over. The fly does not go back to the bird, a proof\r\nthat her ovaries are exhausted. The next day, she is dead. The eggs are\r\ndabbed in a continuous layer, at the entrance to the throat, at the\r\nroot of the tongue, on the membrane of the palate. Their number appears\r\nconsiderable; the whole inside of the gullet is white with them. I fix\r\na little wooden prop between the two mandibles of the beak, to keep them\r\nopen and enable me to see what happens.\r\n\r\nI learn in this way that the hatching takes place in a couple of days.\r\nAs soon as they are born, the young vermin, a swarming mass, leave the\r\nplace where they are and disappear down the throat. To inquire further\r\ninto the work is useless for the moment. We shall learn more about it\r\nlater, under conditions that make examination easier.\r\n\r\nThe beak of the bird invaded was closed at the start, as far as the\r\nnatural contact of the mandibles allowed. There remained a narrow slit\r\nat the base, sufficient at most to admit the passage of a horsehair.\r\nIt was through this that the laying was performed. Lengthening her\r\novipositor like a telescope, the mother inserted the point of her\r\nimplement, a point slightly hardened with a horny armor. The fineness\r\nof the probe equals the fineness of the aperture. But, if the beak were\r\nentirely closed, where would the eggs be laid then?\r\n\r\nWith a tied thread, I keep the two mandibles in absolute contact; and\r\nI place a second bluebottle in the presence of the linnet, which the\r\ncolonists have already entered by the beak. This time, the laying\r\ntakes place on one of the eyes, between the lid and the eyeball. At\r\nthe hatching, which again occurs a couple of days later, the grubs make\r\ntheir way into the fleshy depths of the socket. The eyes and the beak,\r\ntherefore, form the two chief entrances into feathered game.\r\n\r\nThere are others; and these are the wounds. I cover the linnet's head\r\nwith a paper hood which will prevent invasion through the beak and eyes.\r\nI serve it, under the wire gauze bell, to a third egg layer. The bird\r\nhas been struck by a shot in the breast, but the sore is not bleeding:\r\nno outer stain marks the injured spot. Moreover, I am careful to arrange\r\nthe feathers, to smooth them with a hair pencil, so that the bird looks\r\nquite smart and has every appearance of being untouched.\r\n\r\nThe fly is soon there. She inspects the linnet from end to end; with\r\nher front tarsi she fumbles at the breast and belly. It is a sort of\r\nauscultation by sense of touch. The insect becomes aware of what is\r\nunder the feathers by the manner in which these react. If scent comes\r\nto her assistance, it can only be very slightly, for the game is not yet\r\nhigh. The wound is soon found. No drop of blood is near it, for it is\r\nclosed by a plug of down rammed into it by the shot. The fly takes up\r\nher position without separating the feathers or uncovering the wound.\r\nShe remains here for two hours without stirring, motionless, with her\r\nabdomen concealed beneath the plumage. My eager curiosity does not\r\ndistract her from her business for a moment.\r\n\r\nWhen she has finished, I take her place. There is nothing either on the\r\nskin or at the mouth of the wound. I have to withdraw the downy plug\r\nand dig to some depth before discovering the eggs. The ovipositor has\r\ntherefore lengthened its extensible tube and pushed beyond the feather\r\nstopper driven in by the lead. The eggs are in one packet; they number\r\nabout three hundred.\r\n\r\nWhen the beak and eyes are rendered inaccessible, when the body,\r\nmoreover, has no wounds, the laying still takes place, but, this time,\r\nin a hesitating and niggardly fashion. I pluck the bird completely, the\r\nbetter to watch what happens; also, I cover the head with a paper hood\r\nto close the usual means of access. For a long time, with jerky steps,\r\nthe mother explores the body in every direction; she takes her stand by\r\npreference on the head, which she sounds by tapping on it with her front\r\ntarsi. She knows that the openings which she needs are there, under\r\nthe paper; but she also knows how frail are her grubs, how powerless to\r\npierce their way through the strange obstacle which stops her as well\r\nand interferes with the work of her ovipositor. The cowl inspires her\r\nwith profound distrust. Despite the tempting bait of the veiled head,\r\nnot an egg is laid on the wrapper, slight though it may be.\r\n\r\nWeary of vain attempts to compass this obstacle, the Fly at last decides\r\nin favor of other points, but not on the breast, belly or back, where\r\nthe hide would seem too tough and the light too intrusive. She needs\r\ndark hiding places, corners where the skin is very delicate. The spots\r\nchosen are the cavity of the axilla, corresponding with our armpit,\r\nand the crease where the thigh joins the belly. Eggs are laid in both\r\nplaces, but not many, showing that the groin and the axilla are adopted\r\nonly reluctantly and for lack of a better spot.\r\n\r\nWith an unplucked bird, also hooded, the same experiment failed: the\r\nfeathers prevent the fly from slipping into those deep places. Let us\r\nadd, in conclusion, that, on a skinned bird, or simply on a piece of\r\nbutcher's meat, the laying is effected on any part whatever, provided\r\nthat it be dark. The gloomiest corners are the favorite ones.\r\n\r\nIt follows from all this that, to lay the eggs, the Bluebottle picks out\r\neither naked wounds or else the mucous membranes of the mouth or eyes,\r\nwhich are not protected by a skin of any thickness. She also needs\r\ndarkness. We shall see the reasons for her preference later on.\r\n\r\nThe perfect efficiency of the paper bag, which prevents the inroads\r\nof the worms through the eye sockets or the beak, suggests a similar\r\nexperiment with the whole bird. It is a matter of wrapping the body in a\r\nsort of artificial skin which will be as discouraging to the fly as the\r\nnatural skin. Linnets, some with deep wounds, others almost intact,\r\nare placed one by one in paper envelopes similar to those in which the\r\nnursery gardener keeps his seeds, envelopes just folded, without being\r\nstuck. The paper is quite ordinary and of average thickness. Torn pieces\r\nof newspaper serve the purpose.\r\n\r\nThese sheaths with the corpses inside them are freely exposed to the\r\nair, on the table in my study, where they are visited, according to the\r\ntime of day, in dense shade and in bright sunlight. Attracted by the\r\neffluvia from the dead meat, the bluebottles haunt my laboratory, the\r\nwindows of which are always open. I see them daily alighting on the\r\nenvelopes and very busily exploring them, apprised of the contents by\r\nthe gamy smell. Their incessant coming and going is a sign of intense\r\ncupidity; and yet none of them decides to lay on the bags. They do not\r\neven attempt to slide their ovipositor through the slits of the folds.\r\nThe favorable season passes and not an egg is laid on the tempting\r\nwrappers. All the mothers abstain, judging the slender obstacle of the\r\npaper to be more than the vermin will be able to overcome.\r\n\r\nThis caution on the fly's part does not at all surprise me: motherhood\r\neverywhere has gleams of great perspicacity. What does astonish me is\r\nthe following result. The parcels containing the linnets are left for a\r\nwhole year uncovered on the table; they remain there for a second year\r\nand a third. I inspect the contents from time to time. The little birds\r\nare intact, with unrumpled feathers, free from smell, dry and light,\r\nlike mummies. They have become not decomposed, but mummified.\r\n\r\nI expected to see them putrefying, running into sanies, like corpses\r\nleft to rot in the open air. On the contrary, the birds have dried and\r\nhardened, without undergoing any change. What did they want for their\r\nputrefaction? Simply the intervention of the fly. The maggot, therefore,\r\nis the primary cause of dissolution after death; it is, above all, the\r\nputrefactive chemist.\r\n\r\nA conclusion not devoid of value may be drawn from my paper game bags.\r\nIn our markets, especially in those of the South, the game is hung\r\nunprotected from the hooks on the stalls. Larks strung up by the dozen\r\nwith a wire through their nostrils, thrushes, plovers, teal, partridges,\r\nsnipe, in short, all the glories of the spit which the autumn migration\r\nbrings us, remain for days and weeks at the mercy of the flies. The\r\nbuyer allows himself to be tempted by a goodly exterior; he makes his\r\npurchase and, back at home, just when the bird is being prepared for\r\nroasting, he discovers that the promised dainty is alive with worms. O\r\nhorror! There is nothing for it but to throw the loathsome, verminous\r\nthing away.\r\n\r\nThe bluebottle is the culprit here. Everybody knows it; and nobody\r\nthinks of seriously shaking off her tyranny: not the retailer, nor the\r\nwholesale dealer, nor the killer of the game. What is wanted to keep the\r\nmaggots out? Hardly anything: to slip each bird into a paper sheath. If\r\nthis precaution were taken at the start, before the flies arrive, any\r\ngame would be safe and could be left indefinitely to attain the degree\r\nof ripeness required by the epicure's palate.\r\n\r\nStuffed with olives and myrtle berries, the Corsican blackbirds are\r\nexquisite eating. We sometimes receive them at Orange, layers of them,\r\npacked in baskets through which the air circulates freely and\r\neach contained in a paper wrapper. They are in a state of perfect\r\npreservation, complying with the most exacting demands of the kitchen.\r\nI congratulate the nameless shipper who conceived the bright idea of\r\nclothing his blackbirds in paper. Will his example find imitators? I\r\ndoubt it.\r\n\r\nThere is, of course, a serious objection to this method of preservation.\r\nIn its paper shroud, the article is invisible; it is not enticing; it\r\ndoes not inform the passer by of its nature and qualities. There is one\r\nresource left which would leave the bird uncovered: simply to case the\r\nhead in a paper cap. The head being the part most threatened, because of\r\nthe mucus membrane of the throat and eyes, it would be sufficient, as a\r\nrule, to protect the head, in order to keep off the Flies and to thwart\r\ntheir attempts.\r\n\r\nLet us continue to study the bluebottle, while varying our means\r\nof information. A tin, about four inches deep, contains a piece of\r\nbutcher's meat. The lid is not put in quite straight and leaves a\r\nnarrow slit at one point of its circumference, allowing, at most, of the\r\npassage of a fine needle. When the bait begins to give off a gamy scent,\r\nthe mothers come. Singly or in numbers. They are attracted by the odor\r\nwhich, transmitted through a thin crevice, hardly reaches my nostrils.\r\n\r\nThey explore the metal receptacle for some time, seeking an entrance.\r\nFinding naught that enables them to reach the coveted morsel, they\r\ndecide to lay their eggs on the tin, just beside the aperture.\r\nSometimes, when the width of the passage allows of it, they insert the\r\novipositor into the tin and lay the eggs inside, on the very edges of\r\nthe slit. Whether outside or in, the eggs are dabbed down in a fairly\r\nregular and absolutely white layer. I as it were shovel them up with a\r\nlittle paper scoop. I thus obtain all the germs that I require for\r\nmy experiments, eggs bearing no trace of the stains which would be\r\ninevitable if I had to collect them on tainted meat.\r\n\r\nWe have seen the bluebottle refusing to lay her eggs on the paper bag,\r\nnotwithstanding the carrion fumes of the Linnet enclosed; yet now,\r\nwithout hesitation, she lays them on a sheet of metal. Can the nature of\r\nthe floor make any difference to her? I replace the tin lid by a paper\r\ncover stretched and pasted over the orifice. With the point of my knife,\r\nI make a narrow slit in this new lid. That is quite enough: the parent\r\naccepts the paper.\r\n\r\nWhat determined her, therefore, is not simply the smell, which can\r\neasily be perceived even through the uncut paper, but, above all, the\r\ncrevice, which will provide an entrance for the vermin, hatched outside,\r\nnear the narrow passage. The maggots' mother has her own logic, her\r\nprudent foresight. She knows how feeble her wee grubs will be, how\r\npowerless to cut their way through an obstacle of any resistance; and\r\nso, despite the temptation of the smell, she refrains from laying so\r\nlong as she finds no entrance through which the newborn worms can slip\r\nunaided.\r\n\r\nI wanted to know whether the color, the shininess, the degree of\r\nhardness and other qualities of the obstacle would influence the\r\ndecision of a mother obliged to lay her eggs under exceptional\r\nconditions. With this object in view, I employed small jars, each baited\r\nwith a bit of butcher's meat. The respective lids were made of different\r\ncolored paper, of oilskin, or of some of that tinfoil, with its gold or\r\ncoppery sheen, which is used for sealing liqueur bottles. On not one\r\nof these covers did the mothers stop, with any desire to deposit their\r\neggs; but, from the moment that the knife had made the narrow slit,\r\nall the lids were, sooner or later, visited and all of them, sooner or\r\nlater, received the white shower somewhere near the gash. The look of\r\nthe obstacle, therefore, does not count; dull or brilliant, drab or\r\ncolored: these are details of no importance; the thing that matters is\r\nthat there should be a passage to allow the grubs to enter.\r\n\r\nThough hatched outside, at a distance from the coveted morsel, the\r\nnewborn worms are well able to find their refectory. As they release\r\nthemselves from the egg, without hesitation, so accurate is their scent,\r\nthey slip beneath the edge of the ill-joined lid, or through the passage\r\ncut by the knife. Behold them entering upon their promised land, their\r\nreeking paradise.\r\n\r\nEager to arrive, do they drop from the top of the wall? Not they! Slowly\r\ncreeping, they make their way down the side of the jar; they use their\r\nfore part, ever in quest of information, as a crutch and grapnel in one.\r\nThey reach the meat and at once install themselves upon it.\r\n\r\nLet us continue our investigation, varying the conditions. A large\r\ntest-tube, measuring nine inches high, is baited at the bottom with a\r\nlump of butcher's meat. It is closed with wire gauze, whose meshes, two\r\nmillimeters wide, do not permit of the fly's passage. The bluebottle\r\ncomes to my apparatus, guided by scent rather than sight. She hastens to\r\nthe test tube whose contents are veiled under an opaque cover with the\r\nsame alacrity as to the open tube. The invisible attracts her quite as\r\nmuch as the visible.\r\n\r\nShe stays a while on the lattice of the mouth, inspects it attentively;\r\nbut, whether because circumstances have failed to serve me, or because\r\nthe wire network inspires her with distrust, I never saw her dab her\r\neggs upon it for certain. As her evidence was doubtful, I had recourse\r\nto the flesh fly (Sarcophaga carnaria).\r\n\r\nThis fly is less finicky in her preparations, she has more faith in the\r\nstrength of her worms, which are born ready-formed and vigorous, and\r\neasily shows me what I wish to see. She explores the trellis-work,\r\nchooses a mesh through which she inserts the tip of her abdomen and,\r\nundisturbed by my presence, emits, one after the other, a certain number\r\nof grubs, about ten or so. True, her visits will be repeated, increasing\r\nthe family at a rate of which I am ignorant.\r\n\r\nThe newborn worms, thanks to a slight viscidity, cling for a moment to\r\nthe wire gauze; they swarm, wriggle, release themselves and leap into\r\nthe chasm. It is a nine inch drop at least. When this is done, the\r\nmother makes off, knowing for a certainty that her offspring will shift\r\nfor themselves. If they fall on the meat, well and good; if they fall\r\nelsewhere, they can reach the morsel by crawling.\r\n\r\nThis confidence in the unknown factor of the precipice, with no\r\nindication but that of smell, deserves fuller, investigation. From\r\nwhat height will the flesh fly dare to let her children drop? I top the\r\ntest-tube with another tube, the width of the neck of a claret bottle.\r\nThe mouth is closed either with wire gauze, or with a paper cover with a\r\nslight cut in it. Altogether, the apparatus measures twenty-five inches\r\nin height. No matter: the fall is not serious for the lithe backs of the\r\nyoung grubs; and, in a few days, the test-tube is filled with larvae,\r\nin which it is easy to recognize the flesh fly's family by the fringed\r\ncoronet that opens and shuts at the maggot's stern like the petals of\r\na little flower. I did not see the mother operating: I was not there at\r\nthe time; but there is no doubt possible of her coming nor of the great\r\ndive taken by the family: the contents of the test-tube furnish me with\r\na duly authenticated certificate.\r\n\r\nI admire the leap and, to obtain one better still, I replace the tube\r\nby another, so that the apparatus now stands forty-six inches high. The\r\ncolumn is erected at a spot frequented by flies, in a dim light. Its\r\nmouth, closed with a wire gauze cover, reaches the level of various\r\nother appliances, test-tubes and jars, which are already stocked or\r\nawaiting their colony of vermin. When the position is well known to the\r\nflies, I remove the other tubes and leave the column, lest the visitors\r\nshould turn aside to easier ground.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time, the bluebottle and the flesh fly perch on the\r\ntrellis-work, make a short investigation and then decamp. Throughout the\r\nsummer season, for three whole months, the apparatus remains where it\r\nis, without the least result: never a worm. What is the reason? Does\r\nthe stench of the meat not spread, coming from that depth? Certainly it\r\nspreads: it is unmistakable to my dulled nostrils and still more so to\r\nthe nostrils of my children, whom I call to bear witness. Then why does\r\nthe flesh fly, who but now was dropping her grubs from a goodly height,\r\nrefuse to let them fall from the top of a column twice as high? Does\r\nshe fear lest her worms should be bruised by an excessive drop? There\r\nis nothing about her to point to anxiety aroused by the length of the\r\nshaft. I never see her explore the tube or take its size. She stands on\r\nthe trellised orifice; and there the matter ends. Can she be apprised\r\nof the depth of the chasm by the comparative faintness of the offensive\r\nodors that arise from it? Can the sense of smell measure the distance\r\nand judge whether it be acceptable or not? Perhaps.\r\n\r\nThe fact remains that, despite the attraction of the scent, the flesh\r\nfly does not expose her worms to disproportionate falls. Can she know\r\nbeforehand that, when the chrysalides break, her winged family, knocking\r\nwith a sudden flight against the sides of a tall chimney, will be unable\r\nto get out? This foresight would be in agreement with the rules which\r\norder maternal instinct according to future needs.\r\n\r\nBut when the fall does not exceed a certain depth, the budding worms of\r\nthe flesh fly are dropped without a qualm, as all our experiments show.\r\nThis principle has a practical application which is not without its\r\nvalue in matters of domestic economy. It is as well that the wonders of\r\nentomology should sometimes give us a hint of commonplace utility.\r\n\r\nThe usual meat safe is a sort of large cage with a top and bottom\r\nof wood and four wire gauze sides. Hooks fixed into the top are used\r\nwhereby to hang pieces which we wish to protect from the flies. Often,\r\nso as to employ the space to the best advantage, these pieces are simply\r\nlaid on the floor on the cage. With these arrangements, are we sure of\r\nwarding off the fly and her vermin?\r\n\r\nNot at all. We may protect ourselves against the Bluebottle, who is not\r\nmuch inclined to lay her eggs at a distance from the meat; but there is\r\nstill the flesh fly, who is more venturesome and goes more briskly to\r\nwork and who will slip the grubs through a hole in the meshes and drop\r\nthem inside the safe. Agile as they are and well able to crawl, the\r\nworms will easily reach anything on the floor; the only things secure\r\nfrom their attacks will be the pieces hanging from the ceiling. It is\r\nnot in the nature of maggots to explore the heights, especially if this\r\nimplies climbing down a string in addition.\r\n\r\nPeople also use wire gauze dish covers. The trellised dome protects the\r\ncontents even less than does the meat safe. The flesh fly takes no heed\r\nof it. She can drop her worms through the meshes on the covered joint.\r\n\r\nThen what are we to do? Nothing could be simpler. We need only wrap\r\nthe birds which we wish to preserve--thrushes, partridges, snipe and so\r\non--in separate paper envelopes; and the same with our beef and mutton.\r\nThis defensive armor alone, while leaving ample room for the air to\r\ncirculate, makes any invasion by the worms impossible, even without a\r\ncover or a meat safe: not that paper possesses any special preservative\r\nvirtues, but solely because it forms an impenetrable barrier. The\r\nBluebottle carefully refrains from laying her eggs upon it and the flesh\r\nfly from bringing forth her offspring, both of them knowing that their\r\nnewborn young are incapable of piercing the obstacle.\r\n\r\nPaper is equally successful in our strife against the Moths, those\r\nplagues of our furs and clothes. To keep away these wholesale ravages,\r\npeople generally use camphor, naphthalene, tobacco, bunches of lavender\r\nand other strong-scented remedies. Without wishing to malign those\r\npreservatives, we are bound to admit that the means employed are none\r\ntoo effective. The smell does very little to prevent the havoc of the\r\nmoths.\r\n\r\nI would therefore counsel our housewives, instead of all this chemist's\r\nstuff, to use newspapers of a suitable shape and size. Take whatever you\r\nwish to protect--your furs, your flannel or your clothes--and pack each\r\narticle carefully in a newspaper, joining the edges with a double fold,\r\nwell pinned. If this joining is properly done, the Moth will never get\r\ninside. Since my advice has been taken and this method employed in my\r\nhousehold, the old damage has never been repeated.\r\n\r\nTo return to the fly. A piece of meat is hidden in a jar under a layer\r\nof fine, dry sand, a finger's-breadth thick. The jar has a wide mouth\r\nand is left quite open. Let whoever come that will, attracted by the\r\nsmell. The Bluebottles are not long in inspecting what I have prepared\r\nfor them: they enter the jar, go out and come back again, inquiring into\r\nthe invisible thing revealed by its fragrance. A diligent watch enables\r\nme to see them fussing about, exploring the sandy expanse, tapping it\r\nwith their feet, sounding it with their proboscis. I leave the visitors\r\nundisturbed for a fortnight or three weeks. None of them lays any eggs.\r\n\r\nThis is a repetition of what the paper bag, with its dead bird, showed\r\nme. The flies refuse to lay on the sand, apparently for the same\r\nreasons. The paper was considered an obstacle which the frail vermin\r\nwould not be able to overcome. With sand, the case is worse. Its\r\ngrittiness would hurt the newborn weaklings, its dryness would absorb\r\nthe moisture indispensable to their movements. Later, when preparing for\r\nthe metamorphosis, when their strength has come to them, the grubs will\r\ndig the earth quite well and be able to descend; but, at the start,\r\nthat would be very dangerous for them. Knowing these difficulties, the\r\nmothers, however greatly tempted by the smell, abstain from breeding. As\r\na matter of fact, after long waiting, fearing lest some packets of eggs\r\nmay have escaped my attention, I inspect the contents of the jar from\r\ntop to bottom. Meat and sand contain neither larvae nor pupae: the whole\r\nis absolutely deserted.\r\n\r\nThe layer of sand being only a finger's-breadth thick, this experiment\r\nrequires certain precautions. The meat may expand a little, in going\r\nbad, and protrude in one or two places. However small the fleshy eyots\r\nthat show above the surface, the flies come to them and breed. Sometimes\r\nalso the juices oozing from the putrid meat soak a small extent of the\r\nsandy floor. That is enough for the maggot's first establishment. These\r\ncauses of failure are avoided with a layer of sand about an inch thick.\r\nThen the bluebottle, the flesh fly and other flies whose grubs batten on\r\ndead bodies are kept at a proper distance.\r\n\r\nIn the hope of awakening us to a proper sense of our insignificance,\r\npulpit orators sometimes make an unfair use of the grave and its worms.\r\nLet us put no faith in their doleful rhetoric. The chemistry of man's\r\nfinal dissolution is eloquent enough of our emptiness: there is no need\r\nto add imaginary horrors. The worm of the sepulchre is an invention of\r\ncantankerous minds, incapable of seeing things as they are. Covered by\r\nbut a few inches of earth, the dead can sleep their quiet sleep: no fly\r\nwill ever come to take advantage of them.\r\n\r\nAt the surface of the soil, exposed to the air, the hideous invasion\r\nis possible; ay, it is the invariable rule. For the melting down and\r\nremolding of matter, man is no better, corpse for corpse, than the\r\nlowest of the brutes. Then the fly exercises her rights and deals with\r\nus as she does with any ordinary animal refuse. Nature treats us with\r\nmagnificent indifference in her great regenerating factory: placed in\r\nher crucibles, animals and men, beggars and kings are one and all alike.\r\nThere you have true equality, the only equality in this world of ours:\r\nequality in the presence of the maggot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV. THE BLUEBOTTLE: THE GRUB\r\n\r\nThe larvae of the bluebottle hatch within two days in the warm weather.\r\nWhether inside my apparatus, in direct contact with the piece of meat,\r\nor outside, on the edge of a slit that enables them to enter, they set\r\nto work at once. They do not eat, in the strict sense of the word,\r\nthat is to say, they do not tear their food, do not chew it by means of\r\nimplements of mastication. Their mouth parts do not lend themselves to\r\nthis sort of work. These mouth parts are two horny spikes, sliding one\r\nupon the other, with curved ends that do not face, thus excluding the\r\npossibility of any function such as seizing and grinding.\r\n\r\nThe two guttural grapnels serve for walking much rather than for\r\nfeeding. The worm plants them alternately in the road traversed and, by\r\ncontracting its crupper, advances just that distance. It carries in\r\nits tubular throat the equivalent of our iron tipped sticks which give\r\nsupport and assist progress.\r\n\r\nThanks to this machinery of the mouth, the maggot not only moves over\r\nthe surface, but also easily penetrates the meat: I see it disappear\r\nas though it were dipping into butter. It cuts its way, levying, as it\r\ngoes, a preliminary toll, but only of liquid mouthfuls. Not the smallest\r\nsolid particle is detached and swallowed. That is not the maggot's\r\ndiet. It wants a broth, a soup, a sort of fluid extract of beef which it\r\nprepares itself. As digestion, after all, merely means liquefaction,\r\nwe may say, without being guilty of paradox, that the grub of the\r\nbluebottle digests its food before swallowing it.\r\n\r\nWith the object of relieving gastric troubles, our manufacturing\r\nchemists scrape the stomachs of the pig and sheep and thus obtain\r\npepsin, a digestive agent which possesses the property of liquefying\r\nalbuminous matters and lean meat in particular. Why cannot they rasp\r\nthe stomach of the maggot! They would obtain a product of the highest\r\nquality, for the carnivorous worm also owns its pepsin, pepsin of a\r\nsingularly active kind, as the following experiments will show us.\r\n\r\nI divide the white of a hard-boiled egg into tiny cubes and place them\r\nin a little test-tube. On the top of the contents, I sprinkle the eggs\r\nof the bluebottle, eggs free from the least stain, taken from those\r\nlaid on the outside of tins baited with meat and not absolutely shut.\r\nA similar test-tube is filled with white of egg, but receives no germs.\r\nBoth are closed with a plug of cotton-wool and left in a dark corner.\r\n\r\nIn a few days, the tube swarming with newborn vermin contains a liquid\r\nas fluid and transparent as water. Not a drop would remain in the\r\ntube if I turned it upside down. All the white of egg has disappeared,\r\nliquefied. As for the worms, which are already a fair size, they seem\r\nvery ill at ease. Deprived of a support whence to attain the outer air,\r\nmost of them dive into the broth of their own making, where they perish\r\nby drowning. Others, endowed with greater vigor, crawl up the glass to\r\nthe plug and manage to make their way through the wadding. Their pointed\r\nfront, armed with grappling irons, is the nail that penetrates the\r\nfibrous mass.\r\n\r\nIn the other test-tube, standing beside the first and subjected to\r\nthe same atmospheric influences, nothing striking has occurred. The\r\nhard-boiled white of egg has retained its dead white color and its\r\nfirmness. I find it as I left it. The utmost that I observe is a few\r\ntraces of must. The result of this first experiment is patent: the\r\nBluebottle's grub is the medium that converts coagulated albumen into a\r\nliquid.\r\n\r\nThe value of chemist's pepsin is estimated by the quantity of\r\nhard-boiled white of egg which a gram of that agent can liquefy. The\r\nmixture has to be exposed in an oven to a temperature of 1400 F. and\r\nalso to be frequently shaken. My preparation, in which the bluebottle's\r\neggs are hatched, is neither shaken nor subjected to the heat of\r\nan oven; everything happens in quietness and under the thermometric\r\nconditions of the surrounding air; nevertheless, in a few days, the\r\ncoagulated albumen, treated by the vermin, runs like water.\r\n\r\nThe reagent that causes this liquefaction escapes my endeavors to detect\r\nit. The worms must disgorge it in infinitesimal doses, while the spikes\r\nin their throats, which are in continual movement, emerge a little\r\nway from the mouth, reenter and reappear. Those piston thrusts, those\r\nquasi-kisses, are accompanied by the emission of the solvent: at least,\r\nthat is how I picture it. The maggot spits on its food, places on it\r\nthe wherewithal to make it into broth. To appraise the quantity of the\r\nmatter expectorated is beyond my powers: I observe the result, but do\r\nnot perceive the leavening agent.\r\n\r\nWell, this result is really astounding, when we consider the scantiness\r\nof the means. No pig's or sheep's pepsin can rival that of the worm.\r\nI have a bottle of pepsin that comes from the School of Chemistry at\r\nMontpellier. I lavishly powder some pieces of hard-boiled white of egg\r\nwith the potent drug, just as I did with the eggs of the Bluebottle.\r\nThe oven is not brought into play, neither is distilled water added, nor\r\nhydrochloric acid: two auxiliaries which are recommended. The experiment\r\nis conducted in exactly the same way as that of the tubes with the\r\nvermin. The result is entirely different from what I expected. The white\r\nof egg does not liquefy. It simply becomes moist on the surface; and\r\neven this moisture may come from the pepsin, which is highly absorbent.\r\nYes, I was right: if the thing were feasible, it would be an advantage\r\nfor the chemists to collect their digestive drug from the stomach of the\r\nmaggot. The worm, in this case, beats the pig and the sheep.\r\n\r\nThe same method is followed for the remaining experiments. I put the\r\nbluebottle's eggs to hatch on a piece of meat and leave the worms to do\r\ntheir work as they please. The lean tissues, whether of mutton, beef\r\nor pork, no matter which, are not turned into liquid; they become a pea\r\nsoup of a clarety brown. The liver, the lung, the spleen are attacked\r\nto better purpose, without, however, getting beyond the state of a\r\nsemi-fluid jam, which easily mixes with water and even appears to\r\ndissolve in it. The brains do not liquefy either: they simply melt into\r\na thin gruel.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, fatty substances, such as beef suet, lard and butter,\r\ndo not undergo any appreciable change. Moreover, the worms soon dwindle\r\naway, incapable of growing. This sort of food does not suit them. Why?\r\nApparently because it cannot be liquefied by the reagent disgorged\r\nby the worms. In the same way, ordinary pepsin does not attack fatty\r\nsubstances; it takes pancreatin to reduce them to an emulsion. This\r\ncurious analogy of properties, positive for albuminous, negative for\r\nfatty matter, proclaims the similarity and perhaps the identity of the\r\ndissolvent discharged by the grubs and the pepsin of the higher animals.\r\n\r\nHere is another proof: the usual pepsin does not dissolve the epidermis,\r\nwhich is a material of a horny nature. That of the maggots does not\r\ndissolve it either. I can easily rear bluebottle grubs on dead crickets\r\nwhose bellies I have first opened; but I do not succeed if the morsel\r\nbe left intact: the worms are unable to perforate the succulent paunch;\r\nthey are stopped by the cuticle, on which their reagent refuses to act.\r\nOr else I give them frogs' hind legs, stripped of their skin. The flesh\r\nturns to broth and disappears to the bone. If I do not peel the legs,\r\nthey remain intact in the midst of the vermin. Their thin skin is\r\nsufficient to protect them.\r\n\r\nThis failure to act upon the epidermis explains why the bluebottle at\r\nwork on the animal declines to lay her eggs on the first part that comes\r\nhandy. She needs the delicate membrane of the nostrils, eyes or throat,\r\nor else some wound in which the flesh is laid bare. No other place suits\r\nher, however excellent for flavor and darkness. At most, finding nothing\r\nbetter when my stratagems interfere, she persuades herself to dab a few\r\neggs under the axilla of a plucked bird or in the groin, two points at\r\nwhich the skin is thinner than elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWith her maternal foresight, the bluebottle knows to perfection the\r\nchoice surfaces, the only ones liable to soften and run under the\r\ninfluence of the reagent dribbled by the newborn grubs. The chemistry\r\nof the future is familiar to her, though she does not use it for her own\r\nfeeding; motherhood, that great inspirer of instinct, teaches her all\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\nScrupulous though she be in choosing exactly where to lay her eggs, the\r\nbluebottle does not trouble about the quality of the provisions intended\r\nfor her family's consumption. Any dead body suits her purpose. Redi, the\r\nItalian scientist who first exploded the old, foolish notion of worms\r\nbegotten of corruption, fed the vermin in his laboratory with meat of\r\nvery different kinds. In order to make his tests the more conclusive,\r\nhe exaggerated the largess of the dining hall. The diet was varied with\r\ntiger and lion flesh, bear and leopard, fox and wolf, mutton and beef,\r\nhorseflesh, donkey flesh and many others, supplied by the rich menagerie\r\nof Florence. This wastefulness was unnecessary: wolf and mutton are all\r\nthe same to an unprejudiced stomach.\r\n\r\nA distant disciple of the maggot's biographer, I look at the problem\r\nin a light which Redi never dreamt of. Any flesh of one of the higher\r\nanimals suits the fly's family. Will it be the same if the food supplied\r\nbe of a lower organism and consist of fish, for instance, of frog,\r\nmollusk, insect, centipede? Will the worms accept these viands and,\r\nabove all, can they manage to liquefy them, which is the first and\r\nforemost condition?\r\n\r\nI serve a piece of raw whiting. The flesh is white, delicate, partly\r\ntranslucent, easy for our stomachs to digest and no less suited to the\r\ngrub's dissolvent. It turns into an opalescent fluid, which runs like\r\nwater. In fact, it liquefies in much the same way as hard-boiled white\r\nof egg. The worms at first wax fat, as long as the conditions allow of\r\nsome solid eyots remaining; then, when foothold fails, threatened with\r\ndrowning in the too fluid broth, they creep up the side of the glass,\r\nanxious and restless to be off. They climb to the cotton-wool stopper of\r\nthe test-tube and try to bolt through the wadding. Endowed with stubborn\r\nperseverance, nearly all of them decamp in spite of the obstacle. The\r\ntest-tube with the white of egg showed me a similar exodus. Although the\r\nfare suits them, as their growth witnesses, the worms cease feeding and\r\nmake a point of escaping when death by drowning is imminent.\r\n\r\nWith other fish, such as skate and sardines, with the flesh of frogs and\r\ntree frogs, the meat simply dissolves into a porridge. Hashes of slug,\r\nScolopendra or praying mantis furnish the same result.\r\n\r\nIn all these preparations, the dissolving agent of the worms is as much\r\nin evidence as when butcher's meat is employed. Moreover, the grubs seem\r\nsatisfied with the queer dish which my curiosity prescribes for them;\r\nthey thrive amidst the victuals and undergo their transformation into\r\npupae.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion, therefore, is much more general than Redi imagined. Any\r\nmeat, no matter whether of a higher or lower order, suits the bluebottle\r\nfor the settlement of her family. The carcasses of furred and feathered\r\nanimals are the favorite victuals, probably because of their richness,\r\nwhich allows of plentiful layings; but, should the occasion demand it,\r\nthe others are also accepted, without inconvenience. Any carrion\r\nthat has lived the life of an animal comes within the domain of these\r\nscavengers.\r\n\r\nWhat is their number to one mother? I have already spoken of a deposit\r\nof three hundred, counted egg by egg. A quite fortuitous circumstance\r\nenabled me to go much farther. In the first week of January 1905, we\r\nexperienced a sudden short cold snap of a severity very exceptional in\r\nmy part of the country. The thermometer fell to twelve degrees below\r\nzero. While a fierce north wind was raging and beginning to redden the\r\nleaves of the olive trees, came one and brought me a barn or screech\r\nowl, which he had found on the ground, exposed to the air, not far from\r\nmy house. My reputation as a lover of animals made the donor believe\r\nthat I should be pleased with his gift.\r\n\r\nI was, as a matter of fact, but for reasons whereof the finder certainly\r\nnever dreamt. The owl was untouched, with trim feathers and not the\r\nleast wound that showed. Perhaps he had died of cold. What made me\r\ngratefully accept the present was exactly that which would have inclined\r\nanyone but myself to refuse it. The owl's eyes, glazed in death, were\r\nhidden under a thick mass of eggs, which I recognized as a bluebottle's.\r\nSimilar masses occupied the vicinity of the nostrils. If I wanted\r\nmaggots, here, of a certainty, was a richer crop than I had ever beheld.\r\n\r\nI place the corpse on the sand of a pan, with a wire gauze cover, and\r\nleave events to take their course. The laboratory in which I install my\r\nbird is none other than my study. It is as cold in there, or nearly, as\r\noutside, so much so that the water in the aquarium in which I used to\r\nrear caddis worms has frozen into a solid block of ice. Under these\r\nconditions of temperature, the owl's eyes keep their white veil of germs\r\nunchanged. Nothing stirs, nothing swarms. Weary of waiting, I pay no\r\nmore attention to the carcass; I leave the future to decide whether the\r\ncold has exterminated the fly's family or not.\r\n\r\nBefore the end of March, the packets of eggs have disappeared, I know\r\nnot how long. The bird, for that matter, seems to be intact. On the\r\nventral surface, which is turned to the air, the feathers keep their\r\nsmooth arrangement and their fresh coloring. I lift the thing. It is\r\nlight, very dry and gives a hard sound, like an old shoe tanned by the\r\nsummer sun in the fields. There is no smell. The dryness has vanquished\r\nthe stench, which, in any case, was never offensive during that time\r\nof frost. On the other hand, the back, which touched the sand, is a\r\nloathsome wreck, partly deprived of its feathers. The quills of the tail\r\nare bare barreled; a few whitened bones show, deprived of their muscles.\r\nThe skin has turned into a dark leather, pierced with round holes like\r\nthose of a sieve. It is all hideously ugly, but most instructive.\r\n\r\nThe wretched owl, with his shattered backbone, teaches us, first of\r\nall, that a temperature twelve degrees of frost does not endanger\r\nthe existence of the bluebottle's germs. The worms were born without\r\naccident, despite the rude blast; they feasted copiously on extract\r\nof meat; then, growing big and fat, they descended into the earth by\r\npiercing round holes in the bird's skin. Their pupae must now be in the\r\nsand of the pan.\r\n\r\nThey are, in point of fact, and in such numbers that I have to resort to\r\nsifting in order to collect them. If I used the forceps, I should never\r\nhave done sorting so great a quantity. The sand passes through the\r\nmeshes of the sieve, the pupae remain above. To count them would wear\r\nout my patience. I measure them by the bushel, that is to say, with a\r\nthimble of which I know the holding capacity in pupae. The result of my\r\ncalculation is not far short of nine hundred.\r\n\r\nDoes this family proceed from one mother? I am quite ready to admit it,\r\nso unlikely is it that the bluebottle, who is so rare inside our houses\r\nduring the severe cold of winter, should be frequent enough outside\r\nto form into groups and to do business in common while an icy blast is\r\nraging. A belated specimen, the plaything of the north wind, and one\r\nalone must have deposited the burden of her ovaries on the owl's eyes.\r\nThis laying of nine hundred eggs, an incomplete laying perhaps, bears\r\nwitness to the mighty part played by the fly as a liquidator of corpses.\r\n\r\nBefore throwing away the screech owl treated by the worms, let us\r\novercome our repugnance and give a glance inside the bird. We see a\r\ntortuous cavity, fenced in by nameless ruins. Muscles and bowels have\r\ndisappeared, converted into broth and gradually consumed by the teeming\r\nthrong. In every part, what was wet has become dry, what was solid\r\nmuddy. In vain my forceps ransacks every nook and corner: it does not\r\nhit upon a single pupa. All the worms have emigrated, all, without\r\nexception. From first to last, they have forsaken the refuge of the\r\ncorpse, so soft to their delicate skins; they have left the velvet for\r\nthe hard ground. Is dryness necessary to them at this stage? They had\r\nit in the carcass, which was thoroughly drained. Would they protect\r\nthemselves against the cold and rain? No shelter could suit them\r\nbetter than the thick quilt of the feathers, which has remained wholly\r\nundamaged on the belly, the breast and every part that was not in touch\r\nwith the ground. It looks as though they had fled from comfort to seek\r\na less kindly dwelling place. When the hour of transformation came, all\r\nleft the owl, that most excellent lodging; all dived into the sand.\r\n\r\nThe exodus from the mortuary tabernacle was made through the round holes\r\nwherewith the skin is pierced. Those holes are the worms' work: of that\r\nthere is no doubt; and yet we have lately seen the mothers refuse as a\r\nbed for their eggs any part whereat the flesh is protected by a skin\r\nof some thickness. The reason is the failure of the pepsin to act on\r\nepidermic substances. In the absence of liquefaction at such points, the\r\nnourishing gruel is unprocurable. On the other hand, the tiny worms are\r\nnot able--or at least do not know how--to dig through the integument\r\nwith their pair of guttural harpoons, to rend it and reach the\r\nliquefiable flesh. The newborn lack strength and, above all, purpose.\r\nBut, as the time comes for descending into the earth, the worms, now\r\npowerful and suddenly versed in the necessary art, well know how to eat\r\naway patiently and clear themselves a passage. With the hooks of their\r\nspikes they dig, scratch and tear. Instinct has flashes of inspiration.\r\nWhat the animal did not know how to do at the start it learns without\r\napprenticeship when the time comes to practice this or that industry.\r\nThe maggot ripe for burial perforates a membranous obstacle which the\r\ngrub intent upon its broth would not even have attempted to attack with\r\neither its pepsin or its grapnels.\r\n\r\nWhy does the worm quit the carcass, that capital shelter? Why does it go\r\nand take up its abode in the ground? As the leading disinfector of dead\r\nthings, it works at the most important matter, the suppression of the\r\ninfection; but it leaves a plentiful residuum, which does not yield\r\nto the reagents of its analytical chemistry. These remains have to\r\ndisappear in their turn. After the fly, anatomists come hastening, who\r\ntake up the dry relic, nibble skin, tendons and ligaments and scrape the\r\nbones clean.\r\n\r\nThe greatest expert in this work is the Dermestes beetle, an\r\nenthusiastic gnawer of animal remains. Sooner or later, he will come\r\nto the joint already exploited by the fly. Now what would happen if the\r\npupae were there? The answer is obvious. The Dermestes, who loves hard\r\nfood, would dig his teeth into the horny little kegs and demolish them\r\nat a bite. Even though he did not touch the contents, a live thing which\r\nhe probably dislikes, he would at least test the flavor of that lifeless\r\nsubstance, the container. The future Fly would be lost, because her\r\ncasing would be pierced. Even so, in the storerooms of our silk mills,\r\na certain Dermestes (Dermestes vulpinus, FABR.) digs into the cocoons to\r\nattack the horny covering of the chrysalis.\r\n\r\nThe maggot foresees the danger and makes itself scarce before the other\r\narrives. In what sort of memory does it house so much wisdom, indigent,\r\nheadless creature that it is, for it is only by extension that we can\r\ngive the name of head to the animal's pointed fore part? How did it\r\nlearn that, to safeguard the pupa, it must desert the carcass and that,\r\nto safeguard the fly, it must not bury itself too far down?\r\n\r\nTo emerge from underground after the perfect insect is hatched, the\r\nbluebottle's device consists in disjointing her head into two movable\r\nhalves, which, each distended with its great red eye, by turns separate\r\nand reunite. In the intervening space, a large, glassy hernia rises and\r\ndisappears, disappears and rises. When the two move asunder, with one\r\neye forced back to the right, the other to the left, it is as though the\r\ninsect were splitting its brain pan in order to expel the contents. Then\r\nthe hernia rises, blunt at the end and swollen into a great knob. Next,\r\nthe forehead closes and the hernia retreats, leaving visible only a kind\r\nof shapeless muzzle. In short, a frontal pouch, with deep pulsations\r\nmomentarily renewed, becomes the instrument of deliverance, the pestle\r\nwherewith the newly hatched bluebottle bruises the sand and causes it\r\nto crumble. Gradually the legs push the rubbish back and the insect\r\nadvances so much toward the surface.\r\n\r\nA hard task, this exhumation by dint of the blows of a cleft and\r\npalpitating head. Moreover, the exhausting effort has to be made at\r\nthe moment of greatest weakness, when the insect leaves that protecting\r\ncasket, its pupa. It emerges from it pale, flabby and unsightly, sorrily\r\nclad in the wings which, folded lengthwise and made shorter by their\r\nscalloped edge, only just cover the top of the back. Wildly bristling\r\nwith hairs and colored ashen-gray, it is a piteous sight. The large set\r\nof wings, suitable for flight, will spread later. For the moment, it\r\nwould only be in the way amid the obstacles to be passed through. Later\r\nalso will come the faultless dress wherein the iridescent indigo-blue\r\nstands out against the severity of the black.\r\n\r\nThe frontal hernia that crumbles the sand with its impact has a tendency\r\nto make play for some time after the emergence from the ground. Take\r\nhold with the forceps of one of the hind legs of a newly released\r\nfly. Forthwith, the implement of the head begins to work, swelling and\r\nsubsiding as energetically as a moment ago, when it had to make a\r\nhole in the sand. The insect, hampered in its movements as when it was\r\nunderground, struggles as best it can against the only obstacle that\r\nit knows. With its heaving knob, it pounds the air even as but now it\r\npounded the earthy barrier. In all unpleasant circumstances, its one\r\nresource is to cleave its head and produce its cranial hernia, which\r\nmoves out and in, in and out. For nearly two hours, interspersed with\r\nhalts due to fatigue, the little machine keeps throbbing in my forceps.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, however, the desperate one is hardening her skin; she\r\nspreads wide the sail of her wings and dons her deep mourning of black\r\nand darkest blue. Then her eyes, warped sideways, come together and\r\nresume their normal position. The cleft forehead closes; the delivering\r\nblister goes in, never to show itself again. But there is one precaution\r\nto be taken first. With its front tarsi, the insect carefully brushes\r\nthe bump about to disappear from view, lest grit should lodge in the\r\ncranium when the two halves of the head are joined for good.\r\n\r\nThe maggot is aware of the trials that await it when, as a fly, it will\r\nhave to come up from under ground; it knows beforehand how difficult the\r\nascent will be with the feeble instrument at its disposal, so difficult,\r\nin fact, as to become fatal should the journey be at all prolonged.\r\nIt foresees the dangers ahead of it and averts them as well as it can.\r\nGifted with two iron shod sticks in its throat, it can easily descend to\r\nsuch depths as it pleases. The need for greater quiet and a less trying\r\ntemperature calls for the deepest possible home: the lower down it is,\r\nthe better for the welfare of the worm and the pupa, on condition that\r\ndescent be practicable. It is, perfectly; and yet, though free to obey\r\nits inspiration, the grub refrains. I rear it in a deep pan, full of\r\nfine, dry sand, easy to excavate. The interment never goes very far.\r\nAbout a hand's breadth is all that the most progressive digger ventures\r\nupon. Most of the interred remain nearer still to the surface. Here,\r\nunder a thin layer of sand, the grub's skin hardens and becomes a\r\ncoffin, a casket, wherein the transformation sleep is slept. A few\r\nweeks later, the buried one awakes, transfigured but weak, having\r\nnaught wherewith to unearth herself but the throbbing hernia of her open\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\nWhat the maggot denies itself it is open to me to realize, should I\r\ncare to know the depth whence the fly is able to mount. I place fifteen\r\nbluebottle pupae, obtained in winter, at the bottom of a wide tube\r\nclosed at one end. Above the pupae is a perpendicular column of fine,\r\ndry sand, the height of which varies in different tubes. April comes and\r\nthe hatching begins.\r\n\r\nA tube with six centimeters of sand, the shallowest of the columns under\r\nexperiment, yields the best result. Of the fifteen subjects interred\r\nin the pupa stage, fourteen easily reach the surface when they become\r\nflies. Only one of them perishes, one who has not even attempted the\r\nascent. With twelve centimeters of sand, four emerge. With twenty\r\ncentimeters, two, no more. The other flies, jaded with their exertions,\r\nhave died at a higher or lower stage of the road. Lastly, with yet\r\nanother tube wherein the column of sand measured sixty centimeters, I\r\nobtained the liberation of only a single fly. The plucky creature must\r\nhave had a hard struggle to mount from so great a depth, for the other\r\nfourteen did not even manage to burst the lid of their caskets.\r\n\r\nI presume that the looseness of the sand and the consequent pressure\r\nin every direction, similar to that exercised by fluids, have a certain\r\nbearing on the difficulties of the exhumation. Two more tubes are\r\nprepared, but this time supplied with fresh mould, lightly heaped up,\r\nwhich has not the incoherence of sand, with the attendant drawback of\r\npressure. Six centimeters of mould give me eight flies for fifteen pupae\r\nburied; twenty centimeters give me only one. There is less success than\r\nwith the sandy column. My device has diminished the pressure, but,\r\nat the same time, increased the passive resistance. The sand falls of\r\nitself under the impact of the frontal rammer; the unyielding mould\r\ndemands the cutting of a gallery. In fact, I perceive, on the road\r\nfollowed, a shaft which continues indefinitely such as it is. The fly\r\nhas bored it with the temporary blister that throbs between her eyes.\r\n\r\nIn every medium, therefore, whether sand, mould or any earthy\r\ncombination, great are the sufferings that attend the exhumation of the\r\nfly. And so the maggot shuns the depths which a desire for additional\r\nsecurity might seem to recommend. The worm has its own prudence:\r\nforeseeing the dangers ahead, it refrains from making great descents\r\nthat might promote the welfare of the moment. It neglects the present\r\nfor the sake of the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI. A PARASITE OF THE MAGGOT\r\n\r\nThe dangers of the exhumation are not the only ones; the Bluebottle must\r\nbe acquainted with others. Life, when all is said, is a knacker's yard\r\nwherein the devourer of today becomes the devoured of tomorrow; and the\r\nrobber of the dead cannot fail to be robbed of her own life when the\r\ntime comes. I know that she has one exterminator in the person of the\r\ntiny Saprinus beetle, a fisher of fat sausages on the edge of the pools\r\nformed by liquescent corpses. Here swarm in common the grubs of the\r\ngreenbottle, the flesh fly and the bluebottle. The Saprinus draws them\r\nto him from the bank and gobbles them indiscriminately. They represent\r\nto him morsels of equal value.\r\n\r\nThis banquet can be observed only in the open country, under the rays\r\nof a hot sun. Saprini and greenbottles never enter our houses; the flesh\r\nfly visits us but discreetly, does not feel at home with us; the only\r\none who comes fussing along is the bluebottle, who thus escapes the\r\ntribute due to the consumer of plump sausages. But, in the fields, where\r\nshe readily lays her eggs upon any carcass that she finds, she, as well\r\nas the others, sees her vermin swept away by the gluttonous Saprinus.\r\n\r\nIn addition, graver disasters decimate her family, if, as I do not\r\ndoubt, we can apply to the bluebottle what I have seen happen in the\r\ncase of her rival, the flesh fly. So far, I have had no opportunity of\r\nactually perceiving with the first what I have to tell of the second;\r\nstill, I do not hesitate to repeat about the one what observation has\r\ntaught me about the other, for the larval analogies between the two\r\nflies are very close.\r\n\r\nHere are the facts. I have gathered a number of pupae of the flesh fly\r\nin one of my vermin jars. Wishing to examine the pupa's hinder end,\r\nwhich is hollowed into a cup and scalloped into a coronet, I stave in\r\none of the little barrels and force open the last segments with the\r\npoint of my pocketknife. The horny keg does not contain what I expected\r\nto find: it is full of tiny grubs packed one atop the other with the\r\nsame economy of space as anchovies in a bottle. Save for the skin,\r\nwhich has hardened into a brown shell, the substance of the maggot has\r\ndisappeared, changed into a restless swarm.\r\n\r\nThere are thirty-five occupants. I replace them in their casket.\r\nThe rest of my harvest, wherein, no doubt, are other pupae similarly\r\nstocked, is arranged in tubes that will easily show me what happens. The\r\nthing to discover is what genus of parasites the grubs enclosed belong\r\nto. But it is not difficult, without waiting for the hatching of the\r\nadults, to recognize their nature merely by their mode of life. They\r\nform part of the family of Chalcididae, who are microscopic ravagers of\r\nliving entrails.\r\n\r\nNot long ago, in winter, I took from the chrysalis of a great peacock\r\nmoth four hundred and forty-nine parasites belonging to the same group.\r\nThe whole substance of the future moth had disappeared, all but the\r\nnymphal wrapper, which was intact and formed a handsome Russia-leather\r\nwallet. The worm grubs were here heaped up and squeezed together to\r\nthe point of sticking to one another. The hair pencil extracts them in\r\nbundles and cannot separate them without some difficulty. The holding\r\ncapacity is strained to the utmost; the substance of the vanished Moth\r\nwould not fill it better. That which died has been replaced by a living\r\nmass of equal dimensions, but subdivided. The price of this colony's\r\nexistence is the conversion of the chrysalis into a sort of milk food of\r\ndoubtful constitution. The enormous udder has been drained outright.\r\n\r\nYou shudder when you think of that budding flesh nibbled bit by bit by\r\nfour or five hundred gormandizers; the horrified imagination refuses to\r\npicture the anguish suffered by the tortured wretch. But is there really\r\nany pain? We have leave to doubt it. Pain is a patent of nobility; it is\r\nmore pronounced in proportion as the sufferer belongs to a higher order.\r\nIn the lower ranks of animal life, it must be greatly reduced, perhaps\r\neven nil, especially when life, in the throes of evolution, has not yet\r\nacquired a stable equilibrium. The white of an egg is living matter, but\r\nendures the prick of a needle without a quiver. Would it not be the\r\nsame with the chrysalis of the great peacock, dissected cell by cell by\r\nhundreds of infinitesimal anatomists? Would it not be the same with the\r\npupa of the flesh fly? These are organisms put back into the crucible,\r\nreverting to the egg state for a second birth. There is reason to\r\nbelieve, therefore, that their destruction crumb by crumb is merciful.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of August, the parasite of the flesh fly's grubs makes\r\nher appearance out of doors in the adult form. She is a Chalcidid, as\r\nI expected. She issues from the barrel through one or two little round\r\nholes which the prisoners have pierced with a patient tooth. I count\r\nsome thirty to each pupa. There would not be enough room in the abode if\r\nthe family were larger.\r\n\r\nThe imp is a slim and elegant creature, but oh, how small! She measures\r\nhardly two millimeters. Her garb is bronzed black, with pale legs and a\r\nheart shaped, pointed, slightly pedunculate abdomen, with never a trace\r\nof a probe for inoculating the eggs. The head is transversal, the width\r\nexceeding the length.\r\n\r\nThe male is only half the size of the female; he is also very much less\r\nnumerous. Perhaps pairing is here, as we see elsewhere, a secondary\r\nmatter from which it is possible to abstain, in part, without injuring\r\nthe prospects of the race. Nevertheless, in the tube wherein I have\r\nhoused the swarm, the few males lost among the crowd ardently woo the\r\npassing fair. There is much to be done outside, as long as the flesh\r\nfly's season lasts; things are urgent; and each pigmy hurries as fast as\r\nshe can to take up her part as an exterminator.\r\n\r\nHow is the parasite's inroad into the flesh fly's pupae effected? Truth\r\nis always veiled in a certain mystery. The good fortune that secured\r\nme the ravaged pupa taught me nothing concerning the tactics of the\r\nravager. I have never seen the Chalcidid explore the contents of\r\nmy appliances; my attention was engaged elsewhere and nothing is so\r\ndifficult to see as a thing not yet suspected. But, though direct\r\nobservation be lacking, logic will tell us approximately what we want to\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, to begin with, that the invasion cannot have been made\r\nthrough the sturdy amour of the pupae. This is too hard to be penetrated\r\nby the means at the pigmy's disposal. Naught but the delicate skin of\r\nthe maggots lends itself to the introduction of the germs. An egg laying\r\nmother, therefore, appears, inspects the surface of the pool of sanies\r\nswarming with grubs, selects the one that suits her and perches on\r\nit; then, with the tip of her pointed abdomen, whence emerges, for\r\nan instant, a short probe kept hidden until then, she operates on the\r\npatient, perforating his paunch with a dexterous wound into which the\r\ngerms are inserted. Probably, a number of pricks are administered, as\r\nthe presence of thirty parasites seems to demand.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the maggot's skin is pierced at either one point or many; and\r\nthis happens while the grub is swimming in the pools formed by the\r\nputrid flesh. Having said this, we are faced with a question of serious\r\ninterest. To set it forth necessitates a digression which seems to have\r\nnothing to do with the subject in hand and is nevertheless connected\r\nwith it in the closest fashion. Without certain preliminaries, the\r\nremainder would be unintelligible. So now for the preliminaries.\r\n\r\nI was in those days busy with the poison of the Languedocian scorpion\r\nand its action upon insects. To direct the sting toward this or the\r\nother part of the victim and moreover to regulate its emission would be\r\nabsolutely impossible and also very dangerous, as long as the scorpions\r\nwere allowed to act as they pleased. I wished to be able myself to\r\nchoose the part to be wounded; I likewise wished to vary the dose\r\nof poison at will. How to set about it? The scorpion has no jarlike\r\nreceptacle in which the venom is accumulated and stored, like that\r\npossessed, for instance, by the wasp and the bee. The last segment of\r\nthe tail, gourd shaped and surmounted by the sting, contains only a\r\npowerful mass of muscles along which lie the delicate vessels that\r\nsecrete the poison.\r\n\r\nIn default of a poison jar which I would have placed on one side and\r\ndrawn upon at my convenience, I detach the last segment, forming\r\nthe base of the sting. I obtain it from a dead and already withered\r\nscorpion. A watch glass serves as a basin. Here, I tear and crush the\r\npiece in a few drops of water and leave it to steep for four-and-twenty\r\nhours. The result is the liquid which I propose to use for the\r\ninoculation. If any poison remained in my animal's caudal gourd, there\r\nmust be at least some traces of it in the infusion in the watch glass.\r\n\r\nMy hypodermic syringe is of the simplest. It consists of a little glass\r\ntube, tapering sharply at one end. By drawing in my breath, I fill it\r\nwith the liquid to be tested; I expel the contents by blowing. Its point\r\nis almost as fine as a hair and enables me to regulate the dose to\r\nthe degree which I want. A cubic millimeter is the usual charge. The\r\ninjection has to be made at parts that are generally covered with horn.\r\nSo as not to break the point of my fragile instrument, I prepare the\r\nway with a needle, with which I prick the victim at the spot required. I\r\ninsert the tip of the loaded injector in the hole thus made and I blow.\r\nThe thing is done in a moment, very neatly and in an orthodox fashion,\r\nfavorable to delicate experiments. I am delighted with my modest\r\napparatus.\r\n\r\nI am equally delighted with the results. The scorpion himself, when\r\nwounding with his sting, in which the poison is not diluted as mine is\r\nin the watch glass, would not produce effects like those of my pricks.\r\nHere is something more brutal, producing more convulsion in the\r\nsufferer. The virus of my contriving excels the scorpion's.\r\n\r\nThe test is several times repeated, always with the same mixture, which,\r\ndrying up by spontaneous evaporation, then made to serve again by\r\nthe addition of a few drops of water, once more drained and once more\r\nmoistened, does duty for an indefinite length of time. Instead of\r\nabating, the virulence increases. Moreover, the corpses of the\r\ninsects operated upon undergo a curious change, unknown in my earlier\r\nobservations. Then the suspicion comes to me that the actual poison of\r\nthe scorpion does not enter into the matter at all. What I obtain with\r\nthe end joint of the tail, with the gland at the base of the sting, I\r\nought to obtain with any other part of the animal.\r\n\r\nI crush in a few drops of water a joint of the tail taken from the front\r\nportion, far from the poison glands. After soaking it for twenty-four\r\nhours, I obtain a liquid whose effects are absolutely the same as those\r\nbefore, when I used the joint that bears the sting. I try again with the\r\nscorpion's claws, the contents of which consist solely of muscle. The\r\nresults are just the same. The whole of the animal's body, therefore, no\r\nmatter which fragment be submitted to the steeping process, yields the\r\nvirus that so greatly pricks my curiosity.\r\n\r\nEvery part of the Spanish fly [Cantharis or blistering beetle], inside\r\nand out, is saturated with the blistering element; but there is nothing\r\nlike this in the scorpion, who localizes his venom in his caudal gland\r\nand has none of it elsewhere. The cause of the effects which I observe\r\nis therefore connected with general properties which I ought to find in\r\nany insect, even the most harmless.\r\n\r\nI consult Oryctes nasicornis, the peaceable rhinoceros beetle, on\r\nthis subject. To get at the exact nature of the materials, instead of\r\npulverizing the whole insect in a mortar, I use merely the muscular\r\ntissue obtained by scraping the inside of the dried Oryctes' corselet.\r\nOr else I extract the dry contents of the hind legs. I do the same with\r\nthe desiccated corpses of the cockchafer, the Capricorn, or Cerambyx\r\nbeetle, and the Cetonia, or rosechafer. Each of my gleanings, with a\r\nlittle water added, is left to soften for a couple of days in a watch\r\nglass and yields to the liquid whatever can be extracted from it by\r\ncrushing and dissolving.\r\n\r\nThis time, we take a great step forward. All my preparations, without\r\ndistinction, are horribly virulent. Let the reader judge. I select as\r\nmy first patient the sacred beetle, Scarabaeus sacer, who thanks to his\r\nsize and sturdiness, lends himself admirably to an experiment of this\r\nkind. I operate upon a dozen, in the corselet, on the breast, on the\r\nbelly and, by preference, on one of the hind legs, far removed from the\r\nimpressionable nervous centers. No matter what part my injector attacks,\r\nthe effect produced is the same, or nearly. The insect falls as\r\nthough struck by lightning. It lies on its back and wriggles its legs,\r\nespecially the hind legs. If I set it on its feet again, I behold a sort\r\nof St. Vitus' dance. Scarabaeus lowers his head, arches his back, draws\r\nhimself up on his twitching legs. He marks time with his feet on the\r\nground, moves forward a little, moves as much backward, leans to the\r\nright, leans to the left, in wild disorder, incapable of keeping his\r\nbalance or making progress. And this happens with sudden jerks and\r\njolts, with a vigor no whit inferior to that of the animal in perfect\r\nhealth. It is a displacement of all the works, a storm that uproots the\r\nmutual relations of the muscles.\r\n\r\nSeldom have I witnessed such sufferings, in my career as a\r\ncross-examiner of animals and, therefore, as a torturer. I should feel a\r\nscruple, did I not foresee that the grain of sand shifted today may one\r\nday help us by taking its place in the edifice of knowledge. Life is\r\neverywhere the same, in the Dung beetle's body as in man's. To consult\r\nit in the insect means consulting it in ourselves, means moving towards\r\nvistas which we cannot afford to neglect. That hope justifies my cruel\r\nstudies, which, though apparently so puerile, are in reality worthy of\r\nserious consideration.\r\n\r\nOf my dozen sufferers, some rapidly succumb, others linger for a few\r\nhours. They are all dead by tomorrow. I leave the corpses on the\r\ntable, exposed to the air. Instead of drying and stiffening, like the\r\nasphyxiated insects intended for our collections, my patients, on the\r\ncontrary, turn soft and slacken in the joints, notwithstanding the\r\ndryness of the surrounding air; they become disjointed and separate into\r\nloose pieces, which are easily removed.\r\n\r\nThe results are the same with the Capricorn, the cockchafer, the\r\nProcrustes [a large ground beetle], the Carabus [the true ground beetle,\r\nincluding the gold beetle]. In all of them there is a sudden break-up,\r\nfollowed by speedy death, a slackening of the joints and swift\r\nputrefaction. In a non-horny victim, the quick chemical changes of\r\nthe tissues are even more striking. A Cetonia grub, which resists the\r\nscorpion's sting, even though repeatedly administered, dies in a very\r\nshort time if I inject a tiny drop of my terrible fluid into any part\r\nof its body. Moreover, it turns very brown and, in a couple of days,\r\nbecomes a mass of black putrescence.\r\n\r\nThe great peacock, that large moth who recks little of the scorpion's\r\npoison, is no more able to resist my inoculations than the sacred beetle\r\nand the others. I prick two in the belly, a male and a female. At first,\r\nthey seem to bear the operation without distress. They grip the trellis\r\nwork of the cage and hang without moving, as though indifferent. But\r\nsoon the disease has them in its grip. What we see is not the tumultuous\r\nending of the sacred beetle; it is the calm advent of death. With wings\r\nslackly quivering, softly they die and drop from the wires. Next day,\r\nboth corpses are remarkably lax; the segments of the abdomen separate\r\nand gape at the least touch. Remove the hairs and you shall see that\r\nthe skin, which was white, has turned brown and is changing to black.\r\nCorruption is quickly doing its work.\r\n\r\nThis would be a good opportunity to speak of bacteria and cultures. I\r\nshall do nothing of the sort. On the hazy borderland of the visible and\r\nthe invisible, the microscope inspires me with suspicion. It so easily\r\nreplaces the eye of reality by the eye of imagination; it is so ready to\r\noblige the theorists with just what they want to see. Besides, supposing\r\nthe microbe to be found, if that were possible, the question would be\r\nchanged, not solved. For the problem of the collapse of the structure\r\nthrough the fact of a prick there would be substituted another no less\r\nobscure: how does the said microbe bring about that collapse? In what\r\nway does it go to work? Where lies its power?\r\n\r\nThen what explanation shall I give of the facts which I have just set\r\nforth? Why, none, absolutely none, seeing that I do not know of any. As\r\nI am unable to do better, I will confine myself to a pair of comparisons\r\nor images, which may serve as a brief resting place for the mind on the\r\ndark billows of the unknown.\r\n\r\nAll of us, as children, have amused ourselves with the game of \"card\r\nfriars.\" A number of cards, as many as possible, are bent lengthwise\r\ninto a semi-cylinder. They are placed on a table, one behind the\r\nother, in a winding row, the spaces in which are suitably disposed.\r\nThe performance pleases the eye by its curved lines and its regular\r\narrangement. It possesses order, which is a condition of all animated\r\nmatter. You give a little tap to the first card. It falls and overturns\r\nthe second, which, in the same way, topsy-turvies the third; and so on,\r\nright to the end of the row. In less than no time, the capsizing wave\r\nspreads and the handsome edifice is shattered. Order is succeeded by\r\ndisorder, I might almost say, by death. What was needed thus to upset\r\nthe procession of friars? A very, very slight first push, out of all\r\nproportion to the toppled mass.\r\n\r\nAgain, take a glass balloon containing a solution of alum supersaturated\r\nby heat. It is closed, during the process of boiling, with a cork and\r\nis then allowed to cool. The contents remain fluid and limpid for an\r\nindefinite period. Mobility is here represented by a faint semblance\r\nof life. Remove the cork and drop in a solid particle of alum, however\r\ninfinitesimal. Suddenly, the liquid thickens into a solid lump and gives\r\noff heat. What has happened? This: crystallization has set in at the\r\nfirst contact of the particle of alum, the center of attraction;\r\nnext, it has spread bit by bit, each solidified particle producing the\r\nsolidification of those around. The impulse comes from an atom; the mass\r\nimpelled is boundless. The very small has revolutionized the immense.\r\n\r\nOf course, in the comparison between these two instances and the effects\r\nof my injections, the reader must see no more than a figure of speech,\r\nwhich, without explaining anything, tries to throw a glimmer of light\r\nupon it. The long procession of card friars is knocked down by the mere\r\ntouch of the little finger to the first; the voluminous solution of alum\r\nsuddenly turns solid under the influence of an invisible particle.\r\nIn the same way, the victims of my operations succumb, thrown\r\ninto convulsions by a tiny drop of insignificant size and harmless\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nThen what is there in that terrible liquid? First of all, there is\r\nwater, inactive in itself and simply a vehicle of the active agent. If\r\na proof were needed of its innocuousness, here is one: I inject into the\r\nthigh of any one of the sacred beetle's six legs a drop of pure water\r\nlarger than that of the fatal inoculations. As soon as he is released,\r\nhe makes off and trots about as nimbly as usual. He is quite firm on\r\nhis legs. When put back to his pellet, he rolls it with the same zeal as\r\nbefore the experiment. My injection of water makes no difference to him.\r\n\r\nWhat else is there in the mixture in my watch glasses? There is the\r\ndisintegrated matter of the corpse, especially shreds of dried muscles.\r\nDo these substances yield certain soluble elements to water? Or are they\r\nsimply reduced to a fine dust in the crushing? I will not decide this\r\nquestion, nor is it really of importance. The fact remains that the\r\npoison proceeds from those substances and from them alone. Animal\r\nmatter, therefore, which has ceased to live is an agent of destruction\r\nwithin the organism. The dead cell kills the living cell; in the\r\ndelicate statics of life, it is the grain of sand which, refusing its\r\nsupport, entails the collapse of the whole edifice.\r\n\r\nIn this connection, we may recall those dreadful dissecting room\r\naccidents. Through awkwardness, a student of anatomy pricks himself with\r\nhis scalpel in the course of his work; or else, by inadvertence, he\r\nhas an insignificant scratch on his hand. A cut which one would hardly\r\nnotice, produced by the point of a pocket knife, a scratch of no\r\naccount, from a thorn or otherwise, now becomes a mortal wound, if\r\npowerful antiseptics do not speedily remedy the ill. The scalpel is\r\nsoiled by its contact with the flesh of the corpse; so are the hands.\r\nThat is quite enough. The virus of corruption is introduced; and, if not\r\ntreated in time, the wound proves fatal. The dead has killed the living.\r\nThis also reminds us of the so-called carbuncle flies, the lancet of\r\nwhose mouth parts, contaminated with the sanies of corpses, produces\r\nsuch terrible accidents.\r\n\r\nMy dealings as against insects are, when all is said, nothing but\r\ndissecting room wounds and carbuncle flies' stings. In addition to\r\nthe gangrene that soon impairs and blackens the tissues, I obtain\r\nconvulsions similar to those produced by the scorpion's sting. In its\r\nconvulsive effects, the venomous fluid emitted by the sting bears\r\na close resemblance to the muscular infusions with which I fill my\r\ninjector. We are entitled, therefore, to ask ourselves if poisons,\r\ngenerally speaking, are not themselves a produce of demolition, a\r\ncasting of the organism perpetually renewed, waste matter, in short,\r\nwhich, instead of being gradually expelled, is stored for purposes of\r\nattack and defense. The animal, in that case, would arm itself with its\r\nown refuse in the same way as it sometimes builds itself a home with\r\nits intestinal recrement. Nothing is wasted; life's detritus is used for\r\nself defense.\r\n\r\nAll things considered, my preparations are meat extracts. If I replace\r\nthe flesh of the insect by that of another animal, the ox, for instance,\r\nshall I obtain the same results? Logic says yes; and logic is right.\r\nI dilute with a few drops of water a little Liebig's extract, that\r\nprecious standby of the kitchen. I operate with this fluid on six\r\nCetoniae or rosechafers, four in the grub stage, two in the adult stage.\r\nAt first, the patients move about as usual. Next day, the two Cetoniae\r\nare dead. The larvae resist longer and do not die until the second day.\r\nAll show the same relaxed muscles, the same blackened flesh, signs of\r\nputrefaction. It is probable, therefore, that, if injected into our own\r\nveins, the same fluid would likewise prove fatal. What is excellent in\r\nthe digestive tubes would be appalling in the arteries. What is food in\r\none case is poison in the other.\r\n\r\nA Liebig's extract of a different kind, the broth in which the liquefier\r\npuddles, is of a virulence equal, if not superior, to that of my\r\nproducts. All those operated upon, Capricorns, sacred beetles, ground\r\nbeetles, die in convulsions. This brings us back, after a long way\r\nround, to our starting point, the maggot of the flesh fly. Can the worm,\r\nconstantly floundering in the sanies of a carcass, be itself in danger\r\nof inoculation by that whereon it grows fat? I dare not rely upon\r\nexperiments conducted by myself: my clumsy implements and my shaky hand\r\nmake me fear that, with subjects so small and delicate, I might inflict\r\ndeep wounds which of themselves would bring about death.\r\n\r\nFortunately, I have a collaborator of incomparable skill in the\r\nparasitic Chalcidid. Let us apply to her. To introduce her germs, she\r\nhas perforated the maggot's paunch, has even done so several times over.\r\nThe holes are extremely small, but the poison all around is excessively\r\nsubtle and has thus been able, in certain cases, to penetrate. Now what\r\nhas happened? The pupae, all from the same apparatus, are numerous. They\r\ncan be divided into three not very unequal classes, according to the\r\nresults supplied. Some give me the adult flesh fly, others the parasite.\r\nThe rest, nearly a third, give me nothing, neither this year nor next.\r\n\r\nIn the first two cases, things have taken their normal course: the grub\r\nhas developed into a fly, or else the parasite has devoured the grub. In\r\nthe third case, an accident has occurred. I open the barren pupae. They\r\nare coated inside with a dark glaze, the remains of the dead maggot\r\nconverted into black rottenness. The grub, therefore, has undergone\r\ninoculation by the virus through the fine openings effected by the\r\nChalcidid. The skin has had time to harden into a shell; but it was too\r\nlate, the tissues being already infected.\r\n\r\nThere you see it: in its broth of putrefaction, the worm is exposed\r\nto grave dangers. Now there is a need for maggots in this world, for\r\nmaggots many and voracious, to purge the soil as quickly as possible\r\nof death's impurities. Linnaeus tells us that 'Tres muscae consumunt\r\ncadaver equi aeque cito ac leo.' [Three flies consume the carcass of a\r\nhorse as quickly as a lion could do it.] There is no exaggeration about\r\nthe statement. Yes, of a certainty, the offspring of the flesh fly and\r\nthe bluebottle are expeditious workers. They swarm in a heap, always\r\nseeking, always snuffling with their pointed mouths. In those tumultuous\r\ncrowds, mutual scratches would be inevitable if the worms, like the\r\nother flesh eaters, possessed mandibles, jaws, clippers adapted for\r\ncutting, tearing and chopping; and those scratches, poisoned by the\r\ndreadful gruel lapping them, would all be fatal.\r\n\r\nHow are the worms protected in their horrible work yard? They do not\r\neat: they drink their fill; by means of a pepsin which they disgorge,\r\nthey first turn their foodstuffs into soup; they practice a strange and\r\nexceptional art of feeding, wherein those dangerous carving implements,\r\nthe scalpels with their dissecting room perils, are superfluous. Here\r\nends, for the present, the little that I know or suspect of the maggot,\r\nthe sanitary inspector in the service of the public health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII. RECOLLECTIONS OF CHILDHOOD\r\n\r\nAlmost as much as insects and birds--the former so dear to the child,\r\nwho loves to rear his cockchafers and rose beetles on a bed of hawthorn\r\nin a box pierced with holes; the latter an irresistible temptation, with\r\ntheir nests and their eggs and their little ones opening tiny yellow\r\nbeaks--the mushroom early won my heart with its varied shapes and\r\ncolors. I can still see myself as an innocent small boy sporting my\r\nfirst braces and beginning to know my way through the cabalistic mazes\r\nof my reading book, I see myself in ecstasy before the first bird's nest\r\nfound and the first mushroom gathered. Let us relate these grave events.\r\nOld age loves to meditate the past.\r\n\r\nO happy days when curiosity awakens and frees us from the limbo of\r\nunconsciousness, your distant memory makes me live my best years over\r\nagain. Disturbed at its siesta by some wayfarer, the partridge's young\r\nbrood hastily disperses. Each pretty little ball of down scurries off\r\nand disappears in the brushwood; but, when quiet is restored, at the\r\nfirst summoning note they all return under the mother's wing. Even so,\r\nrecalled by memory, do my recollections of childhood return, those other\r\nfledglings which have lost so many of their feathers on the brambles of\r\nlife. Some, which have hardly come out of the bushes, have aching heads\r\nand tottering steps; some are missing, stifled in some dark corner of\r\nthe thicket; some remain in their full freshness. Now of those which\r\nhave escaped the clutches of time the liveliest are the first-born. For\r\nthem the soft wax of childish memory has been converted into enduring\r\nbronze.\r\n\r\nOn that day, wealthy and leisured, with an apple for my lunch and all\r\nmy time to myself, I decided to visit the brow of the neighboring hill,\r\nhitherto looked upon as the boundary of the world. Right at the top is a\r\nrow of trees which, turning their backs to the wind, bend and toss about\r\nas though to uproot themselves and take to flight. How often, from the\r\nlittle window in my home, have I not seen them bowing their heads in\r\nstormy weather; how often have I not watched them writhing like madmen\r\namid the snow dust which the north wind's broom raises and smoothes\r\nalong the hillside! 'What are they doing up there, those desolate trees?\r\nI am interested in their supple backs, today still and upright against\r\nthe blue of the sky, tomorrow shaken when the clouds pass overhead. I\r\nam gladdened by their calmness; I am distressed by their terrified\r\ngestures. They are my friends. I have them before my eyes at every\r\nhour of the day. In the morning, the sun rises behind their transparent\r\nscreen and ascends in its glory. Where does it come from? I am going to\r\nclimb up there and perhaps I shall find out.\r\n\r\nI mount the slope. It is a lean grass sward close-cropped by the sheep.\r\nIt has no bushes, fertile in rents and tears, for which I should have to\r\nanswer on returning home, nor any rocks, the scaling of which involves\r\nlike dangers; nothing but large, flat stones, scattered here and there.\r\nI. have only to go straight on, over smooth ground. But the sward is as\r\nsteep as a sloping roof. It is long, ever so long; and my legs are\r\nvery short. From time to time, I look up. My friends, the trees on the\r\nhilltop, seem to be no nearer. Cheerily, sonny! Scramble away!\r\n\r\nWhat is this at my feet? A lovely bird has flown from its hiding place\r\nunder the eaves of a big stone. Bless us, here's a nest made of hair\r\nand fine straw! It's the first I have ever found, the first of the joys\r\nwhich the birds are to bring me. And in this nest are six eggs, laid\r\nprettily side by side; and those eggs are a magnificent blue, as though\r\nsteeped in a dye of celestial azure. Overpowered with happiness, I lie\r\ndown on the grass and stare.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the mother, with a little clap of her gullet--'Tack!\r\nTack!'--flies anxiously from stone to stone, not far from the intruder.\r\nMy age knows no pity, is still too barbarous to understand maternal\r\nanguish. A plan is running in my head, a plan worthy of a little beast\r\nof prey. I will come back in a fortnight and collect the nestlings\r\nbefore they can fly away. In the meantime, I will just take one of those\r\npretty blue eggs, only one, as a trophy. Lest it should be crushed, I\r\nplace the fragile thing on a little moss in the scoop of my hand. Let\r\nhim cast a stone at me that has not, in his childhood, known the rapture\r\nof finding his first nest.\r\n\r\nMy delicate burden, which would be ruined by a false step, makes me give\r\nup the remainder of the climb. Some other day I shall see the trees on\r\nthe hilltop over which the sun rises. I go down the slope again. At the\r\nbottom, I meet the parish priest's curate reading his breviary as he\r\ntakes his walk. He sees me coming solemnly along, like a relic bearer;\r\nhe catches sight of my hand hiding something behind my back: 'What have\r\nyou there, my boy?' he asks.\r\n\r\nAll abashed, I open my hand and show my blue egg on its bed of moss.\r\n\r\n'Ah!' says his reverence. 'A Saxicola's egg! Where did you get it?'\r\n\r\n'Up there, father, under a stone.'\r\n\r\nQuestion follows question; and my peccadillo stands confessed. By chance\r\nI found a nest which I was not looking for. There were six eggs in it. I\r\ntook one of them--here it is--and I am waiting for the rest to hatch.\r\nI shall go back for the others when the young birds have their quill\r\nfeathers.\r\n\r\n'You mustn't do that, my little friend,' replies the priest. 'You\r\nmustn't rob the mother of her brood; you must respect the innocent\r\nlittle ones; you must let God's birds grow up and fly from the nest.\r\nThey are the joy of the fields and they clear the earth of its vermin.\r\nBe a good boy, now, and don't touch the nest.'\r\n\r\nI promise and the curate continues his walk. I come home with two good\r\nseeds cast on the fallows of my childish brain. An authoritative word\r\nhas taught me that spoiling birds' nests is a bad action. I did not\r\nquite understand how the bird comes to our aid by destroying vermin, the\r\nscourge of the crops; but I felt, at the bottom of my heart, that it is\r\nwrong to afflict the mothers.\r\n\r\n'Saxicola,' the priest had said, on seeing my find.\r\n\r\n'Hullo!' said I to myself. 'Animals have names, just like ourselves.\r\nWho named them? What are all my different acquaintances in the woods and\r\nmeadows called? What does Saxicola mean?'\r\n\r\nYears passed and Latin taught me that Saxicola means an inhabitant of\r\nthe rocks. My bird, in fact, was flying from one rocky point to the\r\nother while I lay in ecstasy before its eggs; its house, its nest, had\r\nthe rim of a large stone for a roof. Further knowledge gleaned from\r\nbooks taught me that the lover of stony hillsides is also called the\r\nMotteux, or clodhopper, because, in the plowing season, she flies\r\nfrom clod to clod, inspecting the furrows rich in unearthed grubworms.\r\nLastly, I came upon the Provencal expression Cul-blanc, which is also a\r\npicturesque term, suggesting the patch on the bird's rump which spreads\r\nout like a white butterfly flitting over the fields.\r\n\r\nThus did the vocabulary come into being that would one day allow me\r\nto greet by their real names the thousand actors on the stage of the\r\nfields, the thousand little flowers that smile at us from the wayside.\r\nThe word which the curate had spoken without attaching the least\r\nimportance to it revealed a world to me, the world of plants and animals\r\ndesignated by their real names. To the future must belong the task of\r\ndeciphering some pages of the immense lexicon; for today I will content\r\nmyself with remembering the Saxicola, or stonechat.\r\n\r\nOn the west, my village crumbles into an avalanche of garden patches,\r\nin which plums and apples ripen. Low bulging walls, blackened with the\r\nstains of lichens and mosses, support the terraces. The brook runs at\r\nthe foot of the slope. It can be cleared almost everywhere at a bound.\r\nIn the wider parts, flat stones standing out of the water serve as\r\na foot bridge. There is no such thing as a whirlpool, the terror of\r\nmothers when the children are away; it is nowhere more than knee deep.\r\nDear little brook, so tranquil, cool and clear, I have seen majestic\r\nrivers since, I have seen the boundless sea; but nothing in my memories\r\nequals your modest falls. About you clings all the hallowed pleasure of\r\nmy first impressions.\r\n\r\nA miller has bethought him of putting the brook, which used to flow so\r\ngaily through the fields, to work. Halfway up the slope, a watercourse,\r\neconomizing the gradient, diverts part of the water and conducts it into\r\na large reservoir, which supplies the mill wheels with motor power. This\r\nbasin stands beside a frequented path and is walled off at the end.\r\n\r\nOne day, hoisting myself on a playfellow's shoulders, I looked over\r\nthe melancholy wall, all bearded with ferns. I saw bottomless stagnant\r\nwaters, covered with slimy green. In the gaps in the sticky carpet, a\r\nsort of dumpy, black-and-yellow reptile was lazily swimming. Today,\r\nI should call it a salamander; at that time, it appeared to me the\r\noffspring of the serpent and the dragon, of whom we were told such\r\nbloodcurdling tales when we sat up at night. Hoo! I've seen enough:\r\nlet's get down again, quick!\r\n\r\nThe brook runs below. Alders and ash, bending forward on either bank,\r\nmingle their branches and form a verdant arch. At their feet, behind\r\na porch of great twisted roots, are watery caverns prolonged by gloomy\r\ncorridors. On the threshold of these fastnesses shimmers a glint of\r\nsunshine, cut into ovals by the leafy sieve above.\r\n\r\nThis is the haunt of the red-necktied minnows. Come along very gently,\r\nlie flat on the ground and look. What pretty little fish they are, with\r\ntheir scarlet throats! Clustering side by side, with their heads turned\r\nagainst the stream, they puff their cheeks out and in, rinsing their\r\nmouths incessantly. To keep their stationary position in the running\r\nwater, they need naught but a slight quiver of their tail and of the fin\r\non their back. A leaf falls from the tree. Whoosh! The whole troop has\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the brook is a spinney of beeches, with smooth,\r\nstraight trunks, like pillars. In their majestic, shady branches sit\r\nchattering crows, drawing from their wings old feathers replaced by new.\r\nThe ground is padded with moss. At one's first step on the downy carpet,\r\nthe eye is caught by a mushroom, not yet full-spread and looking like\r\nan egg dropped there by some vagrant hen. It is the first that I have\r\npicked, the first that have I turned round and round in my fingers,\r\ninquiring into its structure with that vague curiosity which is the\r\nfirst awakening of observation.\r\n\r\nSoon, I find others, differing in size, shape and color. It is a\r\nreal treat for my prentice eyes. Some are fashioned like bells, like\r\nextinguishers, like cups; some are drawn out into spindles, hollowed\r\ninto funnels, rounded into hemispheres. I come upon some that are broken\r\nand are weeping milky tears; I step on some that, instantly, become\r\ntinged with blue; I see some big ones that are crumbling into rot and\r\nswarming with worms. Others, shaped like pears, are dry and open at the\r\ntop with a round hole, a sort of chimney whence a whiff of smoke escapes\r\nwhen I prod their under side with my finger. These are the most curious.\r\nI fill my pockets with them to make them smoke at my leisure, until I\r\nexhaust the contents, which are at last reduced to a kind of tinder.\r\n\r\nWhat fun I had in that delightful spinney! I returned to it many a time\r\nafter my first find; and here, in the company of the crows, I received\r\nmy first lessons in mushroom lore. My harvests, I need hardly say, were\r\nnot admitted to the house. The mushroom, or the bouturel, as we called\r\nit, had a bad reputation for poisoning people. That was enough to make\r\nmother banish it from the family table. I could scarcely understand\r\nhow the bouturel, so attractive in appearance, came to be so wicked;\r\nhowever, I accepted the experience of my elders; and no disaster ever\r\nensued from my rash friendship with the poisoner.\r\n\r\nAs my visits to the beech clump were repeated, I managed to divide my\r\nfinds into three categories. In the first, which was the most numerous,\r\nthe mushroom was furnished underneath with little radiating leaves. In\r\nthe second, the lower surface was lined with a thick pad pricked with\r\nhardly visible holes. In the third, it bristled with tiny spots similar\r\nto the papillae on a cat's tongue. The need of some order to assist the\r\nmemory made me invent a classification for myself.\r\n\r\nVery much later there fell into my hands certain small books from which\r\nI learnt that my three categories were well known; they even had Latin\r\nnames, which fact was far from displeasing to me. Ennobled by Latin\r\nwhich provided me with my first exercises and translations, glorified\r\nby the ancient language which the rector used in saying his mass, the\r\nmushroom rose in my esteem. To deserve so learned an appellation, it\r\nmust possess a genuine importance.\r\n\r\nThe same books told me the name of the one that had amused me so much\r\nwith its smoking chimney. It is called the puffball in English, but its\r\nFrench name is the vesse-de-loup. I disliked the expression, which to my\r\nmind smacked of bad company. Next to it was a more decent denomination:\r\nLycoperdon; but this was only so in appearance, for Greek roots sooner\r\nor later taught me that Lycoperdon means vesse-de-loup and nothing else.\r\nThe history of plants abounds in terms which it is not always desirable\r\nto translate. Bequeathed to us by earlier ages less reticent than\r\nours, botany has often retained the brutal frankness of words that set\r\npropriety at defiance.\r\n\r\nHow far off are those blessed times when my childish curiosity sought\r\nsolitary exercise in making itself acquainted with the mushroom! 'Eheu!\r\nFugaces labuntur anni!' said Horace. Ah, yes, the years glide fleeting\r\nby, especially when they are nearing their end! They were the merry\r\nbrook that dallies among the willows on imperceptible slopes; today,\r\nthey are the torrent swirling a thousand straws along, as it rushes\r\ntowards the abyss. Fleeting though they be, let us make the most of\r\nthem. At nightfall, the woodcutter hastens to bind his last fagots.\r\nEven so, in my declining days, I, a humble woodcutter in the forest\r\nof science, make haste to put my bundle of sticks in order. 'What\r\nwill remain of my researches on the subject of instinct? Not much,\r\napparently; at most, one or two windows opened on a world that has not\r\nyet been explored with all the attention which it deserves.\r\n\r\nA worse destiny awaits the mushrooms, which were my botanical joys from\r\nmy earliest youth. I have never ceased to keep up my acquaintance with\r\nthem. To this day, for the mere pleasure of renewing it, I go, with a\r\nhalting step, to visit them on fine autumn afternoons. I still love\r\nto see the fat heads of the boletes, the tops of the agarics and the\r\ncoral-red tufts of the clavaria emerge above the carpet pink with\r\nheather.\r\n\r\nAt Serignan, my last stage, they have lavished their seductions upon me,\r\nso plentiful are they on the neighboring hills, wooded with holm oak,\r\narbutus and rosemary. During these latter years, their wealth inspired\r\nme with an insane plan: that of collecting in effigy what I was unable\r\nto keep in its natural state in an herbarium. I began to paint life size\r\npictures of all the species in my neighborhood, from the largest to\r\nthe smallest. I know nothing of the art of painting in watercolors. No\r\nmatter: what I have never seen practiced I will invent, managing badly\r\nat first, then a little better, at last well. The paintbrush will make a\r\nchange from the strain of my daily output of prose.\r\n\r\nI end by possessing some hundreds of sheets representing the mushrooms\r\nof the neighborhood in their natural size and colors. My collection has\r\na certain value. If it lacks artistic finish, at least it boasts the\r\nmerit of accuracy. It brings me visitors on Sundays, country people, who\r\nstare at it in all simplicity, astounded that such fine pictures should\r\nbe done by hand, without a copy and without compasses. They at once\r\nrecognize the mushroom represented; they tell me its popular name, thus\r\nproving the fidelity of my brush.\r\n\r\nWell, what will become of this great pile of drawings, the object of\r\nso much work? No doubt, my family will keep the relic for a time; but,\r\nsooner or later, taking up too much space, shifted from cupboard to\r\ncupboard, from attic to attic, gnawed by the rats, foxed, dirtied and\r\nstained, it will fall into the hands of some little grandnephews who\r\nwill cut it into squares to make paper caps. It is the universal rule.\r\nWhat our illusions have most fondly cherished comes to a pitiful end\r\nunder the claws of ruthless reality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII. INSECTS AND MUSHROOMS\r\n\r\nIt were out of place to recall my long relations with the bolete and\r\nthe agaric if the insect did not here enter into a question of grave\r\ninterest. Several mushrooms are edible, some even enjoy a great\r\nreputation; others are formidable poisons. Short of botanical studies\r\nthat are not within everybody's reach, how are we to distinguish the\r\nharmless from the venomous? There is a widespread belief which says that\r\nany mushroom which insects, or, more frequently, their larvae, their\r\ngrubs, accept can be accepted without fear; any mushroom which they\r\nrefuse must be refused. What is wholesome food for them cannot fail to\r\nbe the same for us; what is poisonous to them is bound to be equally\r\nbaneful to ourselves. This is how people argue, with apparent logic, but\r\nwithout reflecting upon the very different capabilities of stomachs in\r\nthe matter of diet. After all, may there not be some justification for\r\nthe belief? That is what I purpose examining.\r\n\r\nThe insect, especially in the larval stage, is the principal devourer of\r\nthe mushroom. We must distinguish between two groups of consumers. The\r\nfirst really eat, that is to say, they break their food into little\r\nbits, chew it and reduce it to a mouthful which is swallowed just as it\r\nis; the second drink, after first turning their food into a broth, like\r\nthe bluebottles. The first are the less numerous. Confining myself to\r\nthe results of my observations in the neighborhood, I count, all told,\r\nin the group of chewers, four beetles and a moth caterpillar. To\r\nthese may be added the mollusk, as represented by a slug, or, more\r\nspecifically, an arion, of medium size, brown and adorned with a red\r\nedge to his mantle. A modest corporation, when all is said, but active\r\nand enterprising, especially the moth.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the mushroom loving beetles, I will place a Staphylinid\r\n(Oxyporus rufus, LIN.), prettily garbed in red, blue and black. Together\r\nwith his larva, which walks with the aid of a crutch at its back,\r\nhe haunts the fungus of the poplar (Pholiota aegerita, FRIES). He\r\nspecializes in an exclusive diet. I often come across him, both in\r\nspring and autumn, and never any elsewhere than on this mushroom. For\r\nthat matter, he had made a wise choice, the epicure! This popular fungus\r\nis one of our best mushrooms, despite its color of a doubtful white, its\r\nskin which is often wrinkled and its gills soiled with rusty brown\r\nat the spores. We must not judge people by appearances, nor mushrooms\r\neither. This one, magnificent in shape and color, is poisonous; that\r\nother, so poor to look at, is excellent.\r\n\r\nHere are two more specialist beetles, both of small size. One is the\r\nTriplax (Triplax russica, LIN.), who has an orange head and corselet\r\nand black wing-cases. His grub tackles the hispid polyporus (Polyporus\r\nhispidus, BULL.), a coarse and substantial dish, bristling at its top\r\nwith stiff hairs and clinging by its side to the old trunks of mulberry\r\ntrees, sometimes also of walnut and elm trees. The other is the\r\ncinnamon-colored Anisotoma (Anisotoma cinnamomea, PANZ.). His larva\r\nlives exclusively in truffles.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting of the mushroom-eating beetles is the Bolboceras\r\n(Bolboceras gallicus, MUL.). I have described elsewhere his manner of\r\nliving, his little song that sounds like the chirping of a bird,\r\nhis perpendicular wells sunk in search of an underground mushroom\r\n(Hydnocystis orenaria, TUL.), which constitutes his regular nourishment.\r\nHe is also an ardent lover of truffles. I have taken from between his\r\nlegs, at the bottom of his manor house, a real truffle the size of a\r\nhazelnut (Tuber Requienii, TUL.). I tried to rear him in order to make\r\nthe acquaintance of his grub; I housed him in a large earthen pan\r\nfilled with fresh sand and enclosed in a bell cover. Possessing neither\r\nhydnocistes nor truffles, I served him up sundry mushrooms of a rather\r\nfirm consistency, like those of his choice. He refused them all,\r\nhelvellae and clavariae, chanterelles and pezizae alike.\r\n\r\nWith a rhizopogon, a sort of little fungoid potato, which is frequent\r\nin pine woods at a moderate depth and sometimes even on the surface, I\r\nachieved complete success. I had strewn a handful of them on the sand of\r\nmy breeding pan. At nightfall, I often surprised the Bolboceras issuing\r\nfrom his well, exploring the stretch of sand, choosing a piece not too\r\nbig for his strength and gently rolling it towards his abode. He would\r\ngo in again, leaving the rhizopogon, which was too large to take inside,\r\non the threshold, where it served the purpose of a door. Next day, I\r\nfound the piece gnawed, but only on the under side.\r\n\r\nThe Bolboceras does not like eating in public, in the open air; he needs\r\nthe discreet retirement of his crypt. When he fails to find his food\r\nby burrowing under ground, he comes up to look for it on the surface.\r\nMeeting with a morsel to his taste, he takes it home when its size\r\npermits; if not, he leaves it on the threshold of his burrow and gnaws\r\nat it from below, without reappearing outside. Up to the present,\r\nhydnocistes, truffles and rhizopoga are the only food that I have\r\nknown him to eat. These three instances tell us at any rate that the\r\nBolboceras is not a specialist like the Oxyporus and the Triplax; he is\r\nable to vary his diet; perhaps he feeds on all the underground mushrooms\r\nindiscriminately.\r\n\r\nThe moth enlarges her domain yet further. Her caterpillar is a grub five\r\nor six millimeters long, white, with a black shiny head. Colonies of it\r\nabound in most mushrooms. It attacks by preference the top of the stem,\r\nfor epicurean reasons that escape me; thence it spreads throughout the\r\ncap. It is the habitual boarder of the boletes, agarics, lactarii and\r\nrussulie. Apart from certain species and certain groups, everything\r\nsuits it. This puny grub, which will spin itself an infinitesimal\r\ncocoon of white silk under the piece attacked and will later become an\r\ninsignificant moth, is the primordial ravager.\r\n\r\nLet us next mention the arion, that voracious mollusk who also tackles\r\nmost mushrooms of some size. He digs himself spacious niches inside\r\nthem and there sits blissfully eating. Few in numbers, compared with the\r\nother devourers, he usually sets up house alone. He has, by way of a set\r\nof jaws, a powerful plane which creates great breaches in the object of\r\nhis depredations. It is he whose havoc is most apparent.\r\n\r\nNow all these gnawers can be recognized by their leavings, such as\r\ncrumbs and worm holes. They dig clean passages, they slash and crumble\r\nwithout a slimy trail, they are the pinkers. The others, the liquefiers,\r\nare the chemists; they dissolve their food by means of reagents. All are\r\nthe grubs of flies and belong to the commonalty of the Muscidae. Many\r\nare their species. To distinguish them from one another by rearing them\r\nin order to obtain the perfect stage would involve a great expenditure\r\nof time to little profit. We will describe them by the general name of\r\nmaggots.\r\n\r\nTo see them at work, I select, as the field of exploitation, the satanic\r\nbolete (Boletus Satanas, LENZ.), one of the largest mushrooms that I can\r\ngather in my neighborhood. It has a dirty-white cap; the mouths of\r\nthe tubes are a bright orange-red; the stem swells into a bulb with a\r\ndelicate network of carmine veins. I divide a perfectly sound specimen\r\ninto equal parts and place these in two deep plates, put side by side.\r\nOne of the halves is left as it is: it will act as a control, a term of\r\ncomparison. The other half receives on the pores of its undersurface a\r\ncouple of dozen maggots taken from a second bolete in full process of\r\ndecomposition.\r\n\r\nThe dissolving action of the grub asserts itself on the very day whereon\r\nthese preparations are made. The undersurface, originally a bright red,\r\nturns brown and runs in every direction into a mass of dark stalactites.\r\nSoon, the flesh of the cap is attacked and, in a few days, becomes a\r\ngruel similar to liquid asphalt. It is almost as fluid as water. In this\r\nbroth the maggots wallow, wriggling their bodies and, from time to time,\r\nsticking the breathing holes in their sterns above the water. It is an\r\nexact repetition of what the liquefiers of meat, the grubs of the grey\r\nflesh fly and the bluebottle, have lately shown us. As for the second\r\nhalf of the bolete, the half which I did not colonize with vermin,\r\nit remains compact, the same as it was at the start, except that its\r\nappearance is a little withered by evaporation. The fluidity, therefore,\r\nis really and truly the work of the grubs and of them alone.\r\n\r\nDoes this liquefaction imply an easy change? One would think so at\r\nfirst, on seeing how quickly it is performed by the action of the grubs.\r\nMoreover, certain mushrooms, the coprini, liquefy spontaneously and turn\r\ninto a black fluid. One of them bears the expressive name of the inky\r\nmushroom (Coprinus atramentarius, BULL.) and dissolves into ink of its\r\nown accord. The conversion, in certain cases, is singularly rapid. One\r\nday, I was drawing one of our prettiest coprini (Coprinus sterquilinus,\r\nFRIES), which comes out of a little purse or volva. My work was barely\r\ndone, a couple of hours after gathering the fresh mushroom, when the\r\nmodel had disappeared, leaving nothing but a pool of ink upon the table.\r\nHad I procrastinated ever so little, I should not have had time to\r\nfinish and I should have lost a rare and interesting find.\r\n\r\nThis does not mean that the other mushrooms, especially the boletes,\r\nare of ephemeral duration and lacking in consistency. I made the attempt\r\nwith the edible bolete (Boletus edulis, BULL.), the famous cepe of our\r\nkitchens, so highly esteemed for its flavor. I was wondering whether it\r\nwould not be possible to obtain from it a sort of Liebig's extract of\r\nfungus, which would be useful in cooking. With this purpose, I had some\r\nof these mushrooms cut into small pieces and boiled, on the one hand, in\r\nplain water and, on the other, in water with bicarbonate of soda\r\nadded. The treatment lasted two whole days. The flesh of the bolete was\r\nindomitable. To attack it, I should have had to employ violent drugs,\r\nwhich were inadmissible in view of the result to be attained.\r\n\r\nWhat prolonged boiling and the aid of bicarbonate of soda leave almost\r\nintact the fly's grubs quickly turn into fluid, even as the flesh worms\r\nfluidify hard-boiled white of egg. This is done in each instance without\r\nviolence, probably by means of a special pepsin, which is not the same\r\nin both cases. The liquefier of meat has its own brand; the liquefier\r\nof the bolete has another sort. The plate, then, is filled with a dark,\r\nrunning gruel, not unlike tar in appearance. If we allow evaporation\r\nfree course, the broth sets, into a hard, easily crumbled slab,\r\nsomething like toffee. Caught in this matrix, grubs and pupa perish,\r\nincapable of freeing themselves. Analytical chemistry has proved fatal\r\nto them. The conditions are quite different when the attack is delivered\r\non the surface of the ground. Gradually absorbed by the soil, the excess\r\nof liquid disappears, leaving the colonists free. In my dishes, it\r\ncollects indefinitely, killing the inhabitants when it dries up into a\r\nsolid layer.\r\n\r\nThe purple bolete (Boletus purpureus, FRIES), when subjected to the\r\naction of the maggots, gives the same result as the Satanic bolete,\r\nnamely, a black gruel. Note that both mushrooms turn blue if broken and\r\nespecially if crushed. With the edible bolete, whose flesh invariably\r\nremains white when cut, the product of its liquefaction by the vermin is\r\na very pale brown. With the oronge, or imperial mushroom, the result is\r\na broth which the eye would take for a thin apricot jam. Tests made\r\nwith sundry other mushrooms confirm the rule: all, when attacked by the\r\nmaggot, turn into a more or less fluid mess, which varies in color.\r\n\r\nWhy do the two boletes with the red tubes, the purple bolete and the\r\nsatanic bolete, change into a dark gruel? I have an inkling of the\r\nreason. Both of them turn blue, with an admixture of green. A third\r\nspecies, the bluish bolete (Boletus cyanescens, BULL., var. lacteus,\r\nLEVEILLE), possess remarkable color sensitiveness. Bruise it ever\r\nso lightly, no matter where, on the cap, the stem, the tubes of the\r\nundersurface: forthwith, the wounded part, originally a pure white, is\r\ntinted a beautiful blue. Place this bolete in an atmosphere of carbonic\r\nacid gas. We can now knock it, crush it, reduce it to pulp; and the\r\nblue no longer shows. But extract a fragment from the crushed mass:\r\nimmediately, at the first contact with the air, the matter turns a most\r\nglorious blue. It reminds us of a process employed in dyeing. The indigo\r\nof commerce, steeped in water containing lime and sulfate of iron, or\r\ncopperas, is deprived of a part of its oxygen; it loses its color and\r\nbecomes soluble in water, as it was in the original indigo plant, before\r\nthe treatment which the plant underwent. A colorless liquid results.\r\nExpose a drop of this liquid to the air. Straightway, oxidization works\r\nupon the product: the indigo is reformed, insoluble and blue.\r\n\r\nThis is exactly what we see in the boletes that turn blue so readily.\r\nCould they, in fact, contain soluble, colorless indigo? One would say\r\nso, if certain properties did not give grounds for doubt. When subjected\r\nto prolonged exposure to the air, the boletes that are apt to turn blue,\r\nparticularly the most remarkable, Boletus cyanescens, lose their color,\r\ninstead of retaining the deep blue which would be a sign of real indigo.\r\nBe this as it may, these mushrooms contain a coloring principle which is\r\nvery liable to change under the influence of the air. Why should we not\r\nregard it as the cause of the black tint when the maggots have liquefied\r\nthe boletes which turn blue? The others, those with the white flesh, the\r\nedible bolete, for instance, do not assume this asphalty appearance once\r\nthey are liquefied by the grubs.\r\n\r\nAll the boletes that change to blue when broken have a bad reputation;\r\nthe books treat them as dangerous, or at least open to suspicion. The\r\nname of Satanic awarded to one of them is an ample proof of our fears.\r\nThe caterpillar and the maggot are of another opinion: they greedily\r\ndevour what we hold in dread. Now here is a strange thing: those\r\npassionate devotees of Boletus Satanas absolutely refuse certain\r\nmushrooms which we find delightful eating, including the most celebrated\r\nof all, the oronge, the imperial mushroom, which the Romans of the\r\nempire, past masters in gluttony, called the food of the gods, cibus\r\ndeorum, the agaric of the Caesars, Agaricus caesareus. It is the most\r\nelegant of all our mushrooms. When it prepares to make its appearance by\r\nlifting the fissured earth, it is a handsome ovoid formed by the outer\r\nwrapper, the volva. Then this purse gently tears and the jagged opening\r\npartly reveals a globular object of a magnificent orange. Take a hen's\r\negg, boil it, remove the shell: what remains will be the imperial\r\nmushroom in its purse. Remove a part of the white at the top, uncovering\r\na little of the yolk. Then you have the nascent imperial. The likeness\r\nis perfect. And so the people of my part, struck by the resemblance,\r\ncall this mushroom lou rousset d'iou, or, in other words, yolk of egg.\r\nSoon, the cap emerges entirely and spreads into a disk softer than satin\r\nto the touch and richer to the eye than all the fruit of the Hesperides.\r\nAppearing amid the pink heather, it is an entrancing object.\r\n\r\nWell, this gorgeous agaric (Amanita caesarea, SCOP.), this food of the\r\ngods the maggot absolutely refuses. My frequent examinations have\r\nnever shown me an imperial attacked by the grubs in the field. It needs\r\nimprisonment in a jar and the absence of other victuals to provoke the\r\nattempt; and even then the treacle hardly seems to suit them. After the\r\nliquefaction, the grubs try to make off, showing that the fare is not\r\nto their liking. The Mollusk also, the Arion, is anything but an ardent\r\nconsumer. Passing close to an imperial mushroom and finding nothing\r\nbetter, he stops and takes a bite, without lingering. If, therefore, we\r\nrequired the evidence of the insect, or even of the Slug, to know which\r\nmushrooms are good to eat, we should refuse the best of them all. Though\r\nrespected by the vermin, the glorious imperial is nevertheless ruined\r\nnot by larvae, but by a parasitic fungus, the Mycogone rosea, which\r\nspreads in a purply stain and turns it into a putrid mass. This is the\r\nonly despoiler that I know it to possess.\r\n\r\nA second amanita, the sheathed amanita (Amanita vaginata, BULL.),\r\nprettily streaked on the edges of the cap, is of an exquisite flavor,\r\nalmost equal to the imperial. It is called lou pichot gris, the\r\ngrayling, in these parts, because of its coloring, which is usually an\r\nashen gray. Neither the maggot nor the even more enterprising Moth\r\never touches it. They likewise refuse the mottled amanita (Amanita\r\npantherina, D. C.), the vernal amanita (Amanita verna, FRIES) and the\r\nlemon-yellow amanita (Amanita citrina, SCHAEFF.), all three of which are\r\npoisonous. In short, whether it be to us a delicious dish or a deadly\r\npoison, no amanita is accepted by the grubs. The arion alone sometimes\r\nbites at it. The cause of the refusal escapes us. It were vain, speaking\r\nof the mottled amanita, for instance, to allege as a reason the presence\r\nof an alkaloid fatal to the grubs, for we should have to ask ourselves\r\nwhy the imperial, the amanita of the Caesars, which is wholly free from\r\npoison, is rejected no less uncompromisingly than the venomous species.\r\nCould it perhaps be lack of relish, a deficiency of seasoning for\r\nstimulating the appetite? In point of fact, when eaten raw, the amanitas\r\nhave no particular flavor.\r\n\r\nWhat shall we learn from the sharper-flavored mushrooms? Here, in the\r\npinewoods, is the woolly milk mushroom (Lactarius torminosus, SCHAEFF.),\r\nturned in at the edges and wrapped in a curly fleece. Its taste is\r\nbiting, worse than Cayenne pepper. Torminosus means colic producing.\r\nThe name is very suitable. Unless he possessed a stomach built for the\r\npurpose, the man who touched such food as this would have a singularly\r\nbad time before him. Well, that stomach the vermin possess: they\r\nrevel in the pungency of the woolly milk mushroom even as the spurge\r\ncaterpillar browses with delight on the loathsome leaves of the\r\neuphorbiae. As for us, we might as well, in either case, eat live coals.\r\n\r\nIs a condiment of this kind necessary to the grubs? Not at all. Here,\r\nin the same pinewoods, is the \"delicious\" milk mushroom (Lactarius\r\ndeliciosus, LIN.), a glorious orange-red crater, adorned with concentric\r\nzones. If bruised, it assumes a verdigris hue, possibly a variant of the\r\nindigo tint peculiar to the blue-turning boletes. From its flesh laid\r\nbare by being broken or cut ooze blood-red drops, a well-defined\r\ncharacteristic peculiar to this milk mushroom. Here the violent spices\r\nof the woolly milk mushroom disappear; the flesh has a pleasant taste\r\nwhen eaten raw. No matter: the vermin devour the mild milk mushroom with\r\nthe same zest with which they devour the horribly peppered one. To them\r\nthe delicate and the strong, the insipid and the peppery are all alike.\r\n\r\nThe epithet 'delicious' applied to the mushroom whose wound weeps tears\r\nof blood is highly exaggerated. It is edible, no doubt, but it is coarse\r\neating and difficult to digest. My household refuses it for cooking\r\npurposes. We prefer to put it to soak in vinegar and afterwards to use\r\nit as we might use pickled gherkins. The real value of this mushroom is\r\nlargely overrated thanks to a too laudatory epithet.\r\n\r\nIs a certain degree of consistency required, to suit the grubs:\r\nsomething midway between the softness of the amanitas and the firmness\r\nof the milk mushrooms? Let us begin by questioning the olive tree agaric\r\nor luminous mushroom (Pleurotus phosphoreus, BATT.), a magnificent\r\nmushroom colored jujube red. Its popular name is not particularly\r\nappropriate. True, it frequently grows at the base of old olive trees,\r\nbut I also pick it at the foot of the box, the holm oak, the plum tree,\r\nthe cypress, the almond tree, the Guelder rose and other trees and\r\nshrubs. It seems fairly indifferent to the nature of the support. A\r\nmore remarkable feature distinguishes it from all the other European\r\nmushrooms: it is phosphorescent. On the lower surface and there only, it\r\nsheds a soft, white gleam, similar to that of the glowworm. It lights\r\nup to celebrate its nuptials and the emission of its spores. There is no\r\nquestion of chemist's phosphorus here. This is a slow combustion, a\r\nsort of more active respiration than usual. The luminous emission is\r\nextinguished in the unbreathable gases, nitrogen and carbonic acid; it\r\ncontinues in aerated water; it ceases in water deprived of its air by\r\nboiling. It is exceedingly faint, however, so much so that it is not\r\nperceptible except in the deepest darkness. At night and even by day, if\r\nthe eyes have been prepared for it by a preliminary wait in the darkness\r\nof a cellar, this agaric is a wonderful sight, looking indeed like a\r\npiece of the full moon.\r\n\r\nNow what do the vermin do? Are they drawn by this beacon? In no wise:\r\nmaggots, caterpillars and slugs never touch the resplendent mushroom.\r\nLet us not be too quick to explain this refusal by the noxious\r\nproperties of the olive tree agaric, which is said to be extremely\r\npoisonous. Here, in fact, on the pebbly ground of the wastelands, is the\r\neryngo agaric (Pleurotus eryngii, D. C.), which has the same consistency\r\nas the other. It is the berigoulo of the Provencaux, one of the most\r\nhighly esteemed mushrooms. Well, the vermin will have none of it: what\r\nis a treat to us is detestable to them.\r\n\r\nIt is superfluous to continue this method of investigation: the reply\r\nwould be everywhere the same. The insect, which feeds on one sort of\r\nmushroom and refuses others, cannot tell us anything about the kinds\r\nthat are good or bad for us. Its stomach is not ours. It pronounces\r\nexcellent what we find poisonous; it pronounces poisonous what we think\r\nexcellent. That being so, when we are lacking in the botanical knowledge\r\nwhich most of us have neither time nor inclination to acquire, what\r\ncourse are we to take? The course is extremely simple.\r\n\r\nDuring the thirty years and more that I have lived at Serignan, I have\r\nnever heard of one case of mushroom poisoning, even the mildest, in the\r\nvillage; and yet there are plenty of mushrooms eaten here, especially\r\nin autumn. Not a family but, when on a walk in the mountains, gathers\r\na precious addition to its modest alimentary resources. What do these\r\npeople gather? A little of everything. Often, when rambling in the\r\nneighboring woods, I inspect the baskets of the mushroom pickers, who\r\nare delighted for me to look. I see things fit to make mycological\r\nexperts stand aghast. I often find the purple bolete, which is classed\r\namong the dangerous varieties. I made the remark one day. The man\r\ncarrying the basket stared at me in astonishment: 'That a poison! The\r\nwolf's bread!' he said, patting the plump bolete with his hand. 'What\r\nan idea! It's beef marrow, sir, regular beef marrow!' [Author's note:\r\nPeople use them indiscriminately for cooking purposes, after removing\r\nthe tubes on the under side, which are easily separated from the rest of\r\nthe mushroom.]\r\n\r\nHe smiled at my apprehensions and went away with a poor opinion of my\r\nknowledge in the matter of mushrooms.\r\n\r\nIn the baskets aforesaid, I find the ringed agaric (Armillaria mellea,\r\nFRIES), which is stigmatized as valde venenatus by Persoon, an expert\r\non the subject. It is even the mushroom most frequently made use\r\nof, because of its being so plentiful, especially at the foot of the\r\nmulberry trees. I find the Satanic bolete, that dangerous tempter; the\r\nbelted milk mushroom (Lactarius zonarius, BULL.), whose burning flavor\r\nrivals the pepper of its woolly kinsman; the smooth-headed amanita\r\n(Amanita leiocophala, D. C.), a magnificent white dome rising out of\r\nan ample volva and fringed at the edges with floury relics resembling\r\nflakes of casein. Its poisonous smell and soapy aftertaste should lead\r\nto suspicion of this ivory dome; but nobody seems to mind them.\r\n\r\nHow, with such careless picking, are accidents avoided? In my village\r\nand for a long way around, the rule is to blanch the mushrooms, that is\r\nto say, to bring them to the boil in water with a little salt in it.\r\nA few rinsings in cold water conclude the treatment. They are then\r\nprepared in whatever manner one pleases. In this way, what might at\r\nfirst be dangerous becomes harmless, because the preliminary boiling and\r\nrinsing have removed the noxious elements.\r\n\r\nMy personal experience confirms the efficacy of this rustic method.\r\nAt home, we very often make use of the ringed agaric, which is reputed\r\nextremely dangerous. When rendered wholesome by the ordeal of boiling\r\nwater, it becomes a dish of which I have naught but good to say. Then\r\nagain the smooth-headed amanita frequently appears upon my table, after\r\nbeing duly boiled: if it were not first treated in this fashion, it\r\nwould be hardly safe. I have tried the blue-turning boletes, especially\r\nthe purple bolete and the Satanic. They answered very well to the\r\neulogistic term of beef marrow applied to them by the mushroom picker\r\nwho scouted my prudent counsels. I have sometimes employed the mottled\r\namanita, so ill famed in the books, without disastrous result. One of\r\nmy friends, a doctor, to whom I communicated my ideas about the boiling\r\nwater treatment, thought that he would make the experiment on his\r\nown account. He chose the lemon-yellow amanita, which has as bad a\r\nreputation as the mottled variety, and ate it at supper. Everything went\r\noff without the slightest inconvenience. Another, a blind friend, in\r\nwhose company I was one day to taste the Cossus of the Roman epicures,\r\ntreated himself to the olive tree agaric, said to be so formidable. The\r\ndish was, if not excellent, at least harmless.\r\n\r\nIt results from these facts that a good preliminary boiling is the\r\nbest safeguard against accidents arising from mushrooms. If the insect,\r\ndevouring one species and refusing another, cannot guide us in any way,\r\nat least rustic wisdom, the fruit of long experience, prescribes a rule\r\nof conduct which is both simple and efficacious. You are tempted by a\r\nbasketful of mushrooms, but you do not feel very sure as to their\r\ngood or evil properties. Then have them blanched, well and thoroughly\r\nblanched. When it leaves the purgatory of the stewpan, the doubtful\r\nmushroom can be eaten without fear.\r\n\r\nBut this, you will tell me, is a system of cookery fit for savages: the\r\ntreatment with boiling water will reduce the mushrooms to a mash; it\r\nwill take away all their flavor and all their succulence. That is a\r\ncomplete mistake. The mushroom stands the ordeal exceedingly well.\r\nI have described my failure to subdue the cepes when I was trying\r\nto obtain an extract from them. Prolonged boiling, with the aid of\r\nbicarbonate of soda, so far from reducing them to a mess, left them very\r\nnearly intact. The other mushrooms whose size entitles them to culinary\r\nconsideration offer the same degree of resistance. In the second place,\r\nthere is no loss of succulence and hardly any of flavor. Moreover, they\r\nbecome much more digestible, which is a most important condition in\r\na dish generally so heavy for the stomach. For this reason, it is the\r\ncustom, in my family, to treat them one and all with boiling water,\r\nincluding even the glorious imperial.\r\n\r\nI am a Philistine, it is true, a barbarian caring little for the\r\nrefinements of cookery. I am not thinking of the epicure, but of the\r\nfrugal man, the husbandman especially. I should consider myself amply\r\nrepaid for my persistent observations if I succeeded in popularizing,\r\nhowever little, the wise Provencal recipe for mushrooms, an excellent\r\nfood that makes a pleasant change from the dish of beans or potatoes,\r\nwhen we can overcome the difficulty of distinguishing between the\r\nharmless and the dangerous.\r\n\r\n[Recorder's note: Modern mycologists warn against Fabre's claim that\r\nboiling neutralizes all mushroom poisons.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX. A MEMORABLE LESSON\r\n\r\nI take leave of the mushrooms with regret: there would be so many other\r\nquestions to solve concerning them! Why do the maggots eat the Satanic\r\nbolete and scorn the imperial mushroom? How is it that they find\r\ndelicious what we find poisonous and why is it that what seems exquisite\r\nto our taste is loathsome to theirs? Can there be special compounds in\r\nmushrooms, alkaloids, apparently, which vary according to the botanical\r\ngenus? Would it be possible to isolate them and study their properties\r\nfully? Who knows whether medical science could not employ them in\r\nrelieving our ailments, even as it employs quinine, morphia and other\r\nalkaloids? One might inquire into the cause of the liquefaction of the\r\ncoprini, which is spontaneous, and that of the boletes, which is brought\r\nabout by the maggots. Do both cases come within the same category?\r\nDoes the coprinus digest itself by virtue of a pepsin similar to the\r\nmaggots'? One would like to discover the oxidizable substance that gives\r\nthe luminous mushroom its soft, white light, which is like the beams of\r\nthe full moon. It would be interesting to know whether certain boletes\r\nturn blue owing to the presence of an indigo which is more liable\r\nto change than dyers' indigo and whether the green of the so-called\r\ndelicious milk mushroom when bruised is due to a like cause.\r\n\r\nAll these patient chemical investigations would tempt me, if the\r\nrudimentary equipment of my laboratory and especially the irrevocable\r\nflight of age-worn hopes permitted it. The day has passed for it now;\r\nthere is no time left to me. No matter: let us talk chemistry once more,\r\nfor a little while; and, for want of something better, let us revive old\r\nmemories. If the historian, now and again, takes a small place in the\r\nstory of his animals, the reader will kindly excuse him: old age is\r\nprone to these reminiscences, the bloom of later days.\r\n\r\nI have received, in all, two lessons of a scientific character in the\r\ncourse of my life: one in anatomy and one in chemistry. I owe the first\r\nto the learned naturalist Moquin-Tandon, who, on our return from\r\na botanizing expedition to Monte Renoso, in Corsica, showed me the\r\nstructure of a Snail in a plate filled with water. It was short and\r\nfruitful. From that moment, I was initiated. Henceforth, I was to wield\r\nthe scalpel and decently to explore an animal's interior without any\r\nother guidance from a master. The second lesson, that of chemistry, was\r\nless fortunate. I will tell you what happened.\r\n\r\nIn my normal school, the scientific teaching was on an exceedingly\r\nmodest scale, consisting mainly of arithmetic and odds and ends\r\nof geometry. Physics was hardly touched. We were taught a little\r\nmeteorology, in a summary fashion: a word or two about a red moon, a\r\nwhite frost, dew, snow and wind; and, with this smattering of rustic\r\nphysics, we were considered to know enough of the subject to discuss the\r\nweather with the farmer and the plowman.\r\n\r\nOf natural history, absolutely nothing. No one thought of telling us\r\nanything about flowers and trees, which give such zest to one's aimless\r\nrambles, nor about insects, with their curious habits, nor about stones,\r\nso instructive with their fossil records. That entrancing glance through\r\nthe windows of the world was refused us. Grammar was allowed to strangle\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nChemistry was never mentioned either: that goes without saying. I knew\r\nthe word, however. My casual reading, only half-understood for want of\r\npractical demonstration, had taught me that chemistry is concerned with\r\nthe shuffle of matter, uniting or separating the various elements. But\r\nwhat a strange idea I formed of this branch of study! To me it smacked\r\nof sorcery, of alchemy and its search for the philosopher's stone. To my\r\nmind, every chemist, when at work, should have had a magic wand in his\r\nhand and the wizard's pointed, star studded cap on his head.\r\n\r\nAn important personage who sometimes visited the school, in his capacity\r\nas an honorary lecturer, was not the man to rid me of those foolish\r\nnotions. He taught physics and chemistry at the grammar school. Twice a\r\nweek, from eight to nine o'clock in the evening, he held a free public\r\nclass in an enormous building adjacent to our schoolhouse. This was\r\nthe former Church of Saint-Martial, which has today become a Protestant\r\nmeeting house.\r\n\r\nIt was a wizard's cave certainly, just as I had pictured it. At the top\r\nof the steeple, a rusty weathercock creaked mournfully; in the dusk,\r\ngreat Bats flew all around the edifice or dived down the throats of the\r\ngargoyles; at night, Owls hooted upon the copings of the leads. It was\r\ninside, under the immensities of the vault, that my chemist used to\r\nperform. What infernal mixtures did he compound? Should I ever know?\r\n\r\nIt is the day for his visit. He comes to see us with no pointed cap:\r\nin ordinary garb, in fact, with nothing very queer about him. He bursts\r\ninto our schoolroom like a hurricane. His red face is half-buried in the\r\nenormous stiff collar that digs into his ears. A few wisps of red hair\r\nadorn his temples; the top of his head shines like an old ivory ball. In\r\na dictatorial voice and with wooden gestures, he questions two or three\r\nof the boys; after a moment's bullying, he turns on his heel and goes\r\noff in a whirlwind as he came. No, this is not the man, a capital fellow\r\nat heart, to inspire me with a pleasant idea of the things which he\r\nteaches.\r\n\r\nTwo windows of his laboratory look out upon the garden of the school.\r\nOne can just lean on them; and I often come and peep in, trying to make\r\nout, in my poor brain, what chemistry can really be. Unfortunately,\r\nthe room into which my eyes penetrate is not the sanctuary but a mere\r\nouthouse where the learned implements and crockery are washed. Leaden\r\npipes with taps run down the walls; wooden vats occupy the corners.\r\nSometimes, those vats bubble, heated by a spray of steam. A reddish\r\npowder, which looks like brick dust, is boiling in them. I learn that\r\nthe simmering stuff is a dyer's root, known as madder, which will\r\nbe converted into a purer and more concentrated product. This is the\r\nmaster's pet study.\r\n\r\nWhat I saw from the two windows was not enough for me. I wanted to see\r\nfarther, into the very classroom. My wish was satisfied. It was the end\r\nof the scholastic year. A stage ahead in the regular work, I had just\r\nobtained my certificate. I was free. A few weeks remain before the\r\nholidays. Shall I go and spend them out of doors, in all the gaiety of\r\nmy eighteen summers? No, I will spend them at the school which, for two\r\nyears past, has provided me with an untroubled roof and my daily crust.\r\nI will wait until a post is found for me. Employ my willing service as\r\nyou think fit, do with me what you will: as long as I can study, I am\r\nindifferent to the rest.\r\n\r\nThe principal of the school, the soul of kindness, has grasped my\r\npassion for knowledge. He encourages me in my determination; he proposes\r\nto make me renew my acquaintance with Horace and Virgil, so long since\r\nforgotten. He knows Latin, he does; he will rekindle the dead spark\r\nby making me translate a few passages. He does more: he lends me an\r\nImitation with parallel texts in Latin and Greek. With the first text,\r\nwhich I am almost able to read, I will puzzle out the second and thus\r\nincrease the small vocabulary which I acquired in the days when I was\r\ntranslating Aesop's Fables. It will be all the better for my future\r\nstudies. What luck! Board and lodging, ancient poetry, the classical\r\nlanguages, all the good things at once!\r\n\r\nI did better still. Our science master--the real, not the honorary\r\none--who came twice a week to discourse of the rule of three and\r\nthe properties of the triangle, had the brilliant idea of letting\r\nus celebrate the end of the school year with a feast of learning. He\r\npromised to show us oxygen. As a colleague of the chemist in the grammar\r\nschool, he obtained leave to take us to the famous laboratory and there\r\nto handle the object of his lesson under our very eyes. Oxygen, yes,\r\noxygen, the all-consuming gas; that was what we were to see on the\r\nmorrow. I could not sleep all night for thinking of it.\r\n\r\nThursday afternoon came at last. As soon as the chemistry lesson is\r\nover, we were to go for a walk to Les Angles, the pretty village over\r\nyonder, perched on a steep rock. We were therefore in our Sunday best,\r\nour out-of-doors clothes: black frock coats and tall hats. The whole\r\nschool was there, some thirty of us, in the charge of an usher, who knew\r\nas little as we did of the things which we were about to see. We crossed\r\nthe threshold of the laboratory, not without excitement. I entered a\r\ngreat nave with a Gothic roof, an old, bare church through which one's\r\nvoice echoed, into which the light penetrated discreetly through stained\r\nglass windows set in ribs and rosettes of stone. At the back were huge\r\nraised benches, with room for an audience of many hundreds; at the other\r\nend, where the choir once was, stood an enormous chimney mantel; in the\r\nmiddle was a large, massive table, corroded by the chemicals. At one end\r\nof this table was a tarred tub, lined inside with lead and filled with\r\nwater. This, I at once learned, was the pneumatic trough, the vessel in\r\nwhich the gases were collected.\r\n\r\nThe professor begins the experiment. He takes a sort of large, long\r\nglass bulb, bent abruptly in the region of the neck. This, he informs\r\nus, is a retort. He pours into it, from a screw of paper, some black\r\nstuff that looks like powdered charcoal. This is manganese dioxide,\r\nthe master tells us. It contains in abundance, in a condensed state\r\nand retained by combination with the metal, the gas which we propose to\r\nobtain. An oily looking liquid, sulfuric acid, an excessively powerful\r\nagent, will set it at liberty. Thus filled, the retort is placed on a\r\nlighted stove. A glass tube brings it into communication with a bell jar\r\nfull of water on the shelf of the pneumatic trough. Those are all the\r\npreparations. What will be the result? We must wait for the action of\r\nheat.\r\n\r\nMy fellow pupils gather eagerly round the apparatus, cannot come close\r\nenough to it. Some of them play the part of the fly on the wheel and\r\nglory in contributing to the success of the experiment. They straighten\r\nthe retort, which is leaning to one side; they blow with their mouths on\r\nthe coals in the stove. I do not care for these familiarities with the\r\nunknown. The good natured master raises no objection; but I have never\r\nbeen able to endure the thronging of a crowd of gapers, who are very\r\nbusy with their elbows and force their way to the front row to see\r\nwhatever is happening, even though it be merely a couple of mongrels\r\nfighting. Let us withdraw and leave these officious ones to themselves.\r\nThere is so much to see here, while the oxygen is being prepared. Let\r\nus make the most of the occasion and take a look round the chemist's\r\narsenal.\r\n\r\nUnder the spacious chimney mantel is a collection of queer stoves, bound\r\nround with bands of sheet iron. There are long and short ones, high\r\nand low ones, all pierced with little windows that are closed with\r\na terracotta shutter. This one, a sort of little tower, is formed of\r\nseveral parts placed one above the other and each supplied with big\r\nround handles to hold them by when you take the monument to pieces.\r\nA dome, with an iron chimney, tops the whole edifice, which must\r\nbe capable of producing a very hell fire to roast a stone of no\r\nsignificance. Another, a squat one, stretches out like a curved spine.\r\nIt has a round hole at either end; and a thick porcelain tube sticks\r\nout from each. It is impossible to conceive the purpose which such\r\ninstruments as these can serve. The seekers of the philosopher's stone\r\nmust have had many like them. They are torturers' engines, tearing the\r\nmetals' secrets from them.\r\n\r\nThe glass things are arranged on shelves. I see retorts of different\r\nsizes, all with necks bent at a sudden angle. In addition to their long\r\nbeak, some of them have a narrow little tube coming out of their bulb.\r\nLook, youngster, and do not try to guess the object of these curious\r\nvessels. I see glasses with feet to them, funnel-shaped and deep; I\r\nstand amazed at strange looking bottles with two or three mouths to\r\neach, at phials swelling into a balloon with a long, narrow tube. What\r\nan odd array of implements! And here are glass cupboards with a host\r\nof bottles and jars, filled with all manner of chemicals. The labels\r\napprise me of their contents: molybdenite of ammonia, chloride of\r\nantimony, permanganate of potash and ever so many other strange terms.\r\nNever, in all my reading, have I met with such repellent language.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, bang! And there is running and stamping and shouting and cries\r\nof pain! What has happened? I rush up from the back of the room. The\r\nretort has burst, squirting its boiling vitriol in every direction. The\r\nwall opposite is all stained with it. Most of my fellow pupils have been\r\nmore or less struck. One poor youth has had the splashes full in his\r\nface, right into his eyes. He is yelling like a madman. With the help of\r\na friend who has come off better than the others, I drag him outside by\r\nmain force, take him to the sink, which fortunately is close at hand,\r\nand hold his face under the tap. This swift ablution serves its purpose.\r\nThe horrible pain begins to be allayed, so much so that the sufferer\r\nrecovers his senses and is able to continue the washing process for\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nMy prompt aid certainly saved his sight. A week later, with the help of\r\nthe doctor's lotions, all danger was over. How lucky it was that I took\r\nit into my head to keep some way off! My isolation, as I stood looking\r\ninto the glass case of chemicals, left me all my presence of mind,\r\nall my readiness of resource. What are the others doing, those who got\r\nsplashed through standing too near the chemical bomb? I return to the\r\nlecture hall. It is not a cheerful spectacle. The master has come off\r\nbadly: his shirtfront, waistcoat and trousers are covered with smears,\r\nwhich are all smoldering and burning into holes. He hurriedly divests\r\nhimself of a portion of his dangerous raiment. Those of us who possess\r\nthe smartest clothes lend him something to put on so that he can go home\r\ndecently.\r\n\r\nOne of the tall, funnel-shaped glasses which I was admiring just now is\r\nstanding, full of ammonia, on the table. All, coughing and sniveling,\r\ndip their handkerchiefs into it and rub the moist rag over their hats\r\nand coats. In this way, the red stains left by the horrible compound\r\nare made to disappear. A drop of ink will presently restore the color\r\ncompletely.\r\n\r\nAnd the oxygen? There was no more question, I need hardly say, of that.\r\nThe feast of learning was over. Never mind: the disastrous lesson was a\r\nmighty event for me. I had been inside the chemist's laboratory; I\r\nhad had a glimpse of those wonderful jars and tubes. In teaching, what\r\nmatters most is not the thing taught, whether well or badly grasped:\r\nit is the stimulus given to the pupil's latent aptitudes; it is the\r\nfulminate awakening the slumbering explosives. One day, I shall obtain\r\non my own account that oxygen which ill luck has denied me; one day,\r\nwithout a master, I shall yet learn chemistry.\r\n\r\nYes, I shall learn this chemistry, which started so disastrously. And\r\nhow? By teaching it. I do not recommend that method to anybody. Happy\r\nthe man who is guided by a master's word and example! He has a smooth\r\nand easy road before him, lying straight ahead. The other follows a\r\nrugged path, in which his feet often stumble; he goes groping into the\r\nunknown and loses his way. To recover the right road, if want of success\r\nhave not discouraged him, he can rely only on perseverance, the sole\r\ncompass of the poor. Such was my fate. I taught myself by teaching\r\nothers, by passing on to them the modicum of seed that had ripened on\r\nthe barren moor cleared, from day to day, by my patient plowshare.\r\n\r\nA few months after the incident of the vitriol bomb, I was sent to\r\nCarpentras to take charge of junior classes at the college there. The\r\nfirst year was a difficult one, swamped as I was by the excessive number\r\nof pupils, a set of duffers kept out of the more advanced classes and\r\nall at different stages in spelling and grammar. Next year, my school is\r\ndivided into two; I have an assistant. A weeding-out takes place in my\r\ncrowd of scatterbrains. I keep the older, the more intelligent ones;\r\nthe others are to have a term in the preparatory division. From that day\r\nforward, things are different. Curriculum there is none. In those happy\r\ntimes, the master's personality counted for something; there was no such\r\nthing as the scholastic piston working with the regularity of a machine.\r\nIt was left for me to act as I thought fit. Well, what should I do to\r\nmake the school earn its title of 'upper primary'?\r\n\r\nWhy, of course! Among other things, I shall do some chemistry! My\r\nreading has taught me that it does no harm to know a little chemistry,\r\nif you would make your furrows yield a good return. Many of my pupils\r\ncome from the country; they will go back to it to improve their land.\r\nLet us show them what the soil is made of and what the plant feeds on.\r\nOthers will follow industrial careers; they will become tanners,\r\nmetal founders, distillers; they will sell cakes of soap and kegs of\r\nanchovies. Let us show them pickling, soap making, stills, tannin and\r\nmetals. Of course, I know nothing about these things, but I shall learn,\r\nall the more so as I shall have to teach them to the boys; and your\r\nschoolboy is a little demon for jeering at the master's hesitation.\r\n\r\nAs it happens, the college boasts a small laboratory, containing just\r\nwhat is strictly indispensable: a receiver, a dozen glass balloons, a\r\nfew tubes and a niggardly assortment of chemicals. That will do, if I\r\ncan have the run of it. But the laboratory is a sanctum reserved for the\r\nuse of the sixth form. No one sets foot in it except the professor and\r\nhis pupils preparing for their degree. For me, the outsider, to enter\r\nthat tabernacle with my band of young imps would be most unseemly; the\r\nrightful occupant would never think of allowing it. I feel it myself:\r\nelementary teaching dare not aspire to such familiarity with the higher\r\nculture. Very well, we will not go there, so long as they will lend me\r\nthe things.\r\n\r\nI confide my plan to the principal, the supreme dispenser of those\r\nriches. He is a classics man, knows hardly anything of science, at\r\nthat time held in no great esteem, and he does not quite understand the\r\nobject of my request. I humbly insist and exert my powers of persuasion.\r\nI discreetly emphasize the real point of the matter. My group of pupils\r\nis a numerous one. It takes more meals at the schoolhouse--the real\r\nconcern of a principal--than any other section of the college. This\r\ngroup must be encouraged, lured on, increased if possible. The prospect\r\nof disposing of a few more platefuls of soup wins the battle for me;\r\nmy request is granted. Poor science! All that diplomacy to gain your\r\nentrance among the despised ones, who have not been nourished on Cicero\r\nand Demosthenes!\r\n\r\nI am authorized to move, once a week, the material required for my\r\nambitious plans. From the first floor, the sacred dwelling of the\r\nscientific things, I shall take them down to a sort of cellar where I\r\ngive my lessons. The troublesome part is the pneumatic trough. It has\r\nto be emptied before it is carried downstairs and to be filled again\r\nafterwards. A day scholar, a zealous acolyte, hurries over his dinner\r\nand comes to lend me a hand an hour or two before the class begins. We\r\neffect the move between us.\r\n\r\nWhat I am after is oxygen, the gas which I once saw fail so lamentably.\r\nI thought it all out at my leisure, with the help of a book. I will do\r\nthis, I will do that, I will go to work in this or the other fashion.\r\nAbove all, we will run no risks, perhaps of blinding ourselves; for it\r\nis once more a question of heating manganese dioxide with sulfuric acid.\r\nI am filled with misgivings at the recollection of my old school fellow\r\nyelling like mad. Who cares? Let us try for all that: fortune favors the\r\nbrave! Besides, we will make one prudent condition, from which I\r\nshall never depart: no one but myself shall come near the table. If an\r\naccident happen, I shall be the only one to suffer; and, in my opinion,\r\nit is worth a burn or two to make acquaintance with oxygen.\r\n\r\nTwo o'clock strikes; and my pupils enter the classroom. I purposely\r\nexaggerate the likelihood of danger. They are all to stay on their\r\nbenches and not stir. This is agreed. I have plenty of elbow room. There\r\nis no one by me, except my acolyte, standing by my side, ready to help\r\nme when the time comes. The others look on in profound silence, reverent\r\ntowards the unknown.\r\n\r\nSoon the gaseous bubbles come \"gloo-glooing\" through the water in the\r\nbell jar. Can it be my gas? My heart beats with excitement. Can I have\r\nsucceeded without any trouble at the first attempt? We will see. A\r\ncandle blown out that moment and still retaining a red tip to its wick\r\nis lowered by a wire into a small test jar filled with my product.\r\nCapital! The candle lights with a little explosion and burns with\r\nextraordinary brilliancy. It is oxygen right enough.\r\n\r\nThe moment is a solemn one. My audience is astounded and so am I, but\r\nmore at my own success than at the relighted candle. A puff of vainglory\r\nrises to my brow; I feel the fire of enthusiasm run through my veins.\r\nBut I say nothing of these inner sensations. Before the boys' eyes, the\r\nmaster must appear an old hand at the things he teaches. What would the\r\nyoung rascals think of me if I allowed them to suspect my surprise,\r\nif they knew that I myself am beholding the marvelous subject of\r\nmy demonstration for the first time in my life? I should lose their\r\nconfidence, I should sink to the level of a mere pupil.\r\n\r\nSursum corda! Let us go on as if chemistry were a familiar thing to me.\r\nIt is the turn of the steel ribbon, an old watch spring rolled corkscrew\r\nfashion and furnished with a bit of tinder. With this simple lighted\r\nbait, the steel should take fire in a jar filled with my gas. And it\r\ndoes burn; it becomes a splendid firework, with cracklings and a blaze\r\nof sparks and a cloud of rust that tarnishes the jar. From the end of\r\nthe fiery coil a red drop breaks off at intervals, shoots quivering\r\nthrough the layer of water left at the bottom of the vessel and embeds\r\nitself in the glass which has suddenly grown soft. This metallic tear,\r\nwith its indomitable heat, makes every one of us shudder. All stamp and\r\ncheer and applaud. The timid ones place their hands before their faces\r\nand dare not look except through their fingers. My audience exults; and\r\nI myself triumph. Ha, my friends, isn't it grand, this chemistry!\r\n\r\nAll of us have red letter days in our lives. Some, the practical men,\r\nhave been successful in business; they have made money and hold their\r\nheads high in consequence. Others, the thinkers, have gained ideas;\r\nthey have opened a new account in the ledger of nature and they silently\r\ntaste the hallowed joys of truth. One of my great days was that of my\r\nfirst acquaintance with oxygen. On that day, when my class was over and\r\nall the materials put back in their place, I felt myself grow several\r\ninches taller. An untrained workman, I had shown, with complete success,\r\nthat which was unknown to me a couple of hours before. No accident\r\nwhatever, not even the least stain of acid.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, not so difficult nor so dangerous as the pitiful\r\nfinish of the Saint Martial lesson might have led me to believe. With\r\na vigilant eye and a little prudence, I shall be able to continue. The\r\nprospect is enchanting.\r\n\r\nAnd so, in due season, comes hydrogen, carefully contemplated in my\r\nreading, seen and reseen with the eye of the mind before being seen with\r\nthe eyes of the body. I delight my little rascals by making the hydrogen\r\nflame sing in a glass tube, which trickles with the drops of water\r\nresulting from the combustion; I make them jump with the explosions of\r\nthe thunderous mixture. Later, I show them, with the same invariable\r\nsuccess, the splendors of phosphorus, the violent powers of chlorine,\r\nthe loathsome smells of sulfur, the metamorphoses of carbon and so on.\r\nIn short, in a series of lessons, the principal nonmetallic elements and\r\ntheir compounds are passed in review during the course of the year.\r\n\r\nThe thing was bruited abroad. Fresh pupils came to me, attracted by the\r\nmarvels of the school. Additional places were laid in the dining hall;\r\nand the principal, who was more interested in the profits on his beans\r\nand bacon than in chemistry, congratulated me on this accession of\r\nboarders. I was fairly started. Time and an indomitable will would do\r\nthe rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX. INDUSTRIAL CHEMISTRY\r\n\r\nEverything happens sooner or later. When, through the low windows\r\noverlooking the garden of the school, my eye glanced at the laboratory,\r\nwhere the madder vats were steaming; when, in the sanctuary itself,\r\nI was present, by way of a first and last chemistry lesson, at the\r\nexplosion of the retort of sulfuric acid that nearly disfigured every\r\none of us, I was far indeed from suspecting the part which I was\r\ndestined to play under that same vaulted roof. Had a prophet foretold\r\nthat I should one day succeed the master, never would I have believed\r\nhim. Time works these surprises for us.\r\n\r\nStones would have theirs too, if anything were able to astonish them.\r\nThe Saint Martial building was originally a church; it is a protestant\r\nplace of worship now. Men used to pray there in Latin; today they pray\r\nin French. In the intervening period, it was for some years in the\r\nservice of science, the noble orison that dispels the darkness. What has\r\nthe future in store for it? Like many another in the ringing city, to\r\nuse Rabelais' epithet, will it become a home for the fuller's teasels,\r\na warehouse for scrap iron, a carrier's stable? Who knows? Stones have\r\ntheir destinies no less unexpected than ours.\r\n\r\nWhen I took possession of it as a laboratory for the municipal course of\r\nlectures, the nave remained as it was at the time of my former short and\r\ndisastrous visit. To the right, on the wall, a number of black stains\r\nstruck the eye. It was as though a madman's hand, armed with the inkpot,\r\nhad smashed its fragile projectile at that spot. I recognized the stains\r\nat once. They were the marks of the corrosive which the retort had\r\nsplashed at our heads. Since those days of long ago, no one had thought\r\nfit to hide them under a coat of whitewash. So much the better: they\r\nwill serve me as excellent counselors. Always before my eyes, at every\r\nlesson, they will speak to me incessantly of prudence.\r\n\r\nFor all its attractions, however, chemistry did not make me forget a\r\nlong cherished plan well suited to my tastes, that of teaching natural\r\nhistory at a university. Now, one day, at the grammar school, I had a\r\nvisit from a chief inspector which was not of an encouraging nature. My\r\ncolleagues used to call him the Crocodile. Perhaps he had given them a\r\nrough time in the course of his inspections. For all his boorish ways,\r\nhe was an excellent man at heart. I owe him for a piece of advice which\r\ngreatly influenced my future studies.\r\n\r\nThat day, he suddenly appeared, alone, in the schoolroom, where I was\r\ntaking a class in geometrical drawing. I must explain that, at this\r\ntime, to eke out my ridiculous salary and, at all costs, to provide a\r\nliving for myself and my large family, I was a mighty pluralist, both\r\ninside the college and out. At the college in particular, after two\r\nhours of physics, chemistry or natural history, came, without respite,\r\nanother two hours' lesson, in which I taught the boys how to make a\r\nprojection in descriptive geometry, how to draw a geodetic plane, a\r\ncurve of any kind whose law of generation is known to us. This was\r\ncalled graphics.\r\n\r\nThe sudden irruption of the dread personage causes me no great flurry.\r\nTwelve o'clock strikes, the pupils go out and we are left alone. I know\r\nhim to be a geometrician. The transcendental curve, perfectly drawn, may\r\nwork upon his gentler mood. I happen to have in my portfolio the\r\nvery thing to please him. Fortune serves me well in this special\r\ncircumstance. Among my boys, there is one who, though a regular dunce at\r\neverything else, is a first rate hand with the square, the compass and\r\nthe drawing pen: a deft-fingered numskull, in short.\r\n\r\nWith the aid of a system of tangents of which I first showed him the\r\nrule and the method of construction, my artist has obtained the ordinary\r\ncycloid, followed by the interior and the exterior epicycloid and,\r\nlastly, the same curves both lengthened and shortened. His drawings are\r\nadmirable Spider's webs, encircling the cunning curve in their net. The\r\ndraftsmanship is so accurate that it is easy to deduce from it beautiful\r\ntheorems, which would be very laborious to work out by the calculus.\r\n\r\nI submit the geometrical masterpieces to my chief inspector, who is\r\nhimself said to be smitten with geometry. I modestly describe the method\r\nof construction, I call his attention to the fine deductions which the\r\ndrawing enables one to make. It is labor lost: he gives but a heedless\r\nglance at my sheets and flings each on the table as I hand it to him.\r\n\r\n'Alas!' said I to myself. 'There is a storm brewing; the cycloid won't\r\nsave you; it's your turn for a bite from the Crocodile!'\r\n\r\nNot a bit of it. Behold the bugbear growing genial. He sits down on a\r\nbench, with one leg here, another there, invites me to take a seat by\r\nhis side and, in a moment, we are discussing graphics. Then, bluntly:\r\n'Have you any money?' he asks.\r\n\r\nAstounded at this strange question, I answer with a smile.\r\n\r\n'Don't be afraid,' he says. 'Confide in me. I'm asking you in your own\r\ninterest. Have you any capital?'\r\n\r\n'I have no reason to be ashamed of my poverty, monsieur l'inspecteur\r\ngeneral. I frankly admit, I possess nothing; my means are limited to my\r\nmodest salary.'\r\n\r\nA frown greets my answer; and I hear, spoken in an undertone, as though\r\nmy confessor were talking to himself: 'That's sad, that's really very\r\nsad.'\r\n\r\nAstonished to find my penury treated as sad, I ask for an explanation: I\r\nwas not accustomed to this solicitude on the part of my superiors.\r\n\r\n'Why, yes, it's a great pity,' continues the man reputed so terrible. 'I\r\nhave read your articles in the Annales des sciences naturelles. You have\r\nan observant mind, a taste for research, a lively style and a ready pen.\r\nYou would have made a capital university professor.'\r\n\r\n'But that's just what I'm aiming at!'\r\n\r\n'Give up the idea.'\r\n\r\n'Haven't I the necessary attainment?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, you have; but you have no capital.' The great obstacle stands\r\nrevealed to me: woe to the poor in pocket! University teaching demands a\r\nprivate income. Be as ordinary, as commonplace as you please, but, above\r\nall, possess the coin that lets you cut a dash. That is the main thing;\r\nthe rest is a secondary condition.\r\n\r\nAnd the worthy man tells me what poverty in a frock coat means. Though\r\nless of a pauper than I, he has known the mortification of it; he\r\ndescribes it to me, excitedly, in all its bitterness. I listen to him\r\nwith an aching heart; I see the refuge which was to shelter my future\r\ncrumbling before my eyes: 'You have done me a great service, sir,' I\r\nanswered. 'You put an end to my hesitation. For the moment, I give up my\r\nplan. I will first see if it is possible to earn the small fortune which\r\nI shall need if I am to teach in a decent manner.'\r\n\r\nThereupon we exchanged a friendly grip of the hand and parted. I never\r\nsaw him again. His fatherly arguments had soon convinced me: I was\r\nprepared to hear the blunt truth. A few months earlier, I had received\r\nmy nomination as an assistant lecturer in zoology at the university of\r\nPoitiers. They offered me a ridiculous salary. After paying the costs of\r\nmoving, I should have had hardly three francs a day left; and, on this\r\nincome, I had to keep my family, numbering seven in all. I hastened to\r\ndecline the very great honor.\r\n\r\nNo, science ought not to practice these jests. If we humble persons are\r\nof use to her, she should at least enable us to live. If she can't do\r\nthat, then let her leave us to break stones on the highway. Oh, yes, I\r\nwas prepared for the truth when that honest fellow talked to me of frock\r\ncoated poverty! I am telling the story of a not very distant past. Since\r\nthen, things have improved considerably; but, when the pear was properly\r\nripened, I was no longer of an age to pick it.\r\n\r\nAnd what was I to do now, to overcome the difficulty mentioned by my\r\ninspector and confirmed by my personal experience? I would take up\r\nindustrial chemistry. The municipal lectures at Saint Martial placed\r\na spacious and fairly well-equipped laboratory at my disposal. Why not\r\nmake the most of it?\r\n\r\nThe chief manufacture of Avignon was madder. The farmer supplied the\r\nraw material to the factories, where it was turned into purer and more\r\nconcentrated products. My predecessor had gone in for it and done well\r\nby it, so people said. I would follow in his footsteps and use the vats\r\nand furnaces, the expensive plant which I had inherited. So to work.\r\n\r\nWhat should I set myself to produce? I proposed to extract the coloring\r\nsubstance, alizarin, to separate it from the other matters found with it\r\nin the root, to obtain it in the pure state and in a form that allowed\r\nof the direct printing of the stuffs, a much quicker and more artistic\r\nmethod than the old dyeing process.\r\n\r\nNothing could be simpler than this problem, once the solution was known;\r\nbut how tremendously obscure while it had still to be solved! I dare\r\nnot call to mind all the imagination and patience spent upon endless\r\nendeavors which nothing, not even the madness of them, discouraged. What\r\nmighty meditations in the somber church! What glowing dreams, soon to be\r\nfollowed by sore disappointment, when experiment spoke the last word and\r\nupset the scaffolding of my plans. Stubborn as the slave of old amassing\r\na peculium for his enfranchisement, I used to reply to the check of\r\nyesterday by the fresh attempt of tomorrow, often as faulty as\r\nthe others, sometimes the richer by an improvement, and I went on\r\nindefatigably, for I too cherished the indomitable ambition to set\r\nmyself free.\r\n\r\nShould I succeed? Perhaps so. I at last had a satisfactory answer. I\r\nobtained, in a cheap and practical fashion, the pure coloring matter,\r\nconcentrated in a small volume and excellent for both printing and\r\ndyeing. One of my friends took up my process on a large scale in\r\nhis works; a few calico factories adopted the produce and expressed\r\nthemselves delighted with it. The future smiled at last; a pink rift\r\nopened in my gray sky. I should possess the modest fortune without which\r\nI must deny myself the pleasure of teaching in a university. Freed of\r\nthe torturing anxiety about my daily bread, I should be able to live at\r\nease among my insects.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the joys of seeing these problems solved by chemistry,\r\nyet another ray of sunshine was reserved for me, adding its gladness\r\nto that of my success. Let us go back a couple of years. The chief\r\ninspectors visited our grammar school. These personages travel in pairs:\r\none attends to literature, the other to science. When the inspection was\r\nover and the books checked, the staff was summoned to the principal's\r\ndrawing room, to receive the parting admonitions of the two luminaries.\r\nThe man of science began. I should be sadly put to it to remember what\r\nhe said. It was cold professional prose, made up of soulless words\r\nwhich the hearer forgot once the speaker's back was turned, words merely\r\nboring to both. I had heard enough of these chilly sermons in my time;\r\none more of them could not hope to make an impression on me.\r\n\r\nThe inspector in literature spoke next. At the first words which he\r\nuttered, I said to myself: 'Oho! This is a very different business!'\r\n\r\nThe speech was alive and vigorous and full of images; indifferent to\r\nscholastic commonplaces, the ideas soared, hovering gently in the serene\r\nheights of a kindly philosophy. This time, I listened with pleasure;\r\nI even felt stirred. Here was no official homily: it was full of\r\nimpassioned zeal, of words that carried you with them, uttered by an\r\nhonest man accomplished in the art of speaking, an orator in the true\r\nsense of the word. In all my school experience, I had never had such a\r\ntreat.\r\n\r\nWhen the meeting broke up, my heart beat faster than usual: 'What a\r\npity,' I thought, 'that my side, the science side, cannot bring me into\r\ncontact, some day, with that inspector! It seems to me that we should\r\nbecome great friends.'\r\n\r\nI inquired his name of my colleagues, who were always better informed\r\nthan I. They told me it was Victor Duruy.\r\n\r\nWell, one day, two years later, as I was looking after my Saint Martial\r\nlaboratory in the midst of the steam from my vats, with my hands the\r\ncolor of boiled lobster claws from constant dipping in the indelible\r\nred of my dyes, there walked in, unexpectedly, a person whose features\r\nstraightway seemed familiar. I was right, it was the very man, the chief\r\ninspector whose speech had once stirred me. M. Duruy was now minister\r\nof public instruction. He was styled, 'Your excellency;' and this style,\r\nusually an empty formula, was well deserved in the present case, for our\r\nnew minister excelled in his exalted functions. We all held him in high\r\nesteem. He was the workers' minister, the man for the humble toiler.\r\n\r\n'I want to spend my last half-hour at Avignon with you,' said my\r\nvisitor, with a smile. 'That will be a relief from the official bowing\r\nand scraping.'\r\n\r\nOvercome by the honor paid me, I apologized for my costume--I was in my\r\nshirt sleeves--and especially for my lobster claws, which I had tried,\r\nfor a moment, to hide behind my back.\r\n\r\n'You have nothing to apologize for. I came to see the worker. The\r\nworking man never looks better than in his overall, with the marks of\r\nhis trade on him. Let us have a talk. What are you doing just now?'\r\n\r\nI explained, in a few words, the object of my researches; I showed\r\nmy product; I executed under the minister's eyes a little attempt at\r\nprinting in madder red. The success of the experiment and the simplicity\r\nof my apparatus, in which an evaporating dish, maintained at boiling\r\npoint under a glass funnel, took the place of a steam chamber, caused\r\nhim some surprise.\r\n\r\n'I will help you,' he said. 'What do you want for your laboratory?'\r\n\r\n'Why, nothing, monsieur le ministre, nothing! With a little application,\r\nthe plant I have is ample.'\r\n\r\n'What, nothing! You are unique there! The others overwhelm me with\r\nrequests; their laboratories are never well enough supplied. And you,\r\npoor as you are, refuse my offers!'\r\n\r\n'No, there is one thing which I will accept.'\r\n\r\n'What is that?'\r\n\r\n'The signal honor of shaking you by the hand.'\r\n\r\n'There you are, my friend, with all my heart. But that's not enough.\r\nWhat else do you want?'\r\n\r\n'The Paris Jardin des Plantes is under your control. Should a crocodile\r\ndie, let them keep the hide for me. I will stuff it with straw and hang\r\nit from the ceiling. Thus adorned, my workshop will rival the wizard's\r\ncave.'\r\n\r\nThe minister cast his eyes round the nave and glanced up at the Gothic\r\nvault: 'Yes, it would look very well.' And he gave a laugh at my sally.\r\n'I now know you as a chemist,' he continued. 'I knew you already as a\r\nnaturalist and a writer. I have heard about your little animals. I am\r\nsorry that I shall have to leave without seeing them. They must wait for\r\nanother occasion. My train will be starting presently. Walk with me to\r\nthe station, will you? We shall be alone and we can chat a bit more on\r\nthe way.'\r\n\r\nWe strolled along, discussing entomology and madder. My shyness had\r\ndisappeared. The self sufficiency of a fool would have left me dumb;\r\nthe fine frankness of a lofty mind put me at my ease. I told him of my\r\nexperiments in natural history, of my plans for a professorship, of my\r\nfight with harsh fate, my hopes and fears. He encouraged me, spoke to\r\nme of a better future. We reached the station and walked up and down\r\noutside, talking away delightfully.\r\n\r\nA poor old woman passed, all in rags, her back bent by age and years of\r\nwork in the fields. She furtively put out her hand for alms. Duruy\r\nfelt in his waistcoat, found a two franc piece and placed it in the\r\noutstretched hand; I wanted to add a couple of sous as my contribution,\r\nbut my pockets were empty, as usual. I went to the beggar woman and\r\nwhispered in her ear: 'Do you know who gave you that? It's the emperor's\r\nminister.\r\n\r\nThe poor woman started; and her astounded eyes wandered from the\r\nopen-handed swell to the piece of silver and from the piece of silver to\r\nthe open-handed swell. What a surprise! What a windfall!\r\n\r\n'Que lou bon Dieu ie done longo vido e santa, pecaire!' she said, in her\r\ncracked voice.\r\n\r\nAnd, curtseying and nodding, she withdrew, still staring at the coin in\r\nthe palm of her hand.\r\n\r\n'What did she say?' asked Duruy.\r\n\r\n'She wished you long life and health.' 'And pecaire?'\r\n\r\n'Pecaire is a poem in itself: it sums up all the gentler passions.'\r\n\r\nAnd I myself mentally repeated the artless vow. The man who stops so\r\nkindly when a beggar puts out her hand has something better in his soul\r\nthan the mere qualities that go to make a minister.\r\n\r\nWe entered the station, still alone, as promised, and I quite without\r\nmisgivings. Had I but foreseen what was going to happen, how I should\r\nhave hastened to take my leave! Little by little, a group formed in\r\nfront of us. It was too late to fly; I had to screw up my courage.\r\nCame the general of division and his officers, came the prefect and his\r\nsecretary, the mayor and his deputy, the school inspector and the pick\r\nof the staff. The minister faced the ceremonial semicircle. I stood\r\nnext to him. A crowd on one side, we two on the other. Followed the\r\nregulation spinal contortions, the empty obeisances which my dear Duruy\r\nhad come to my laboratory to forget. When bowing to St. Roch, in his\r\ncorner niche, the worshipper at the same time salutes the saint's humble\r\ncompanion. I was something like St. Roch's dog in the presence of those\r\nhonors which did not concern me. I stood and looked on, with my awful\r\nred hands concealed behind my back, under the broad brim of my felt hat.\r\n\r\nAfter the official compliments had been exchanged, the conversation\r\nbegan to languish; and the minister seized my right hand and gently drew\r\nit from the mysterious recesses of my wide awake.\r\n\r\n'Why don't you show those gentlemen your hands?' he said. 'Most people\r\nwould be proud of them.'\r\n\r\n'Workman's hands,' said the prefect's secretary. 'Regular workman's\r\nhands.'\r\n\r\nThe general, almost scandalized at seeing me in such distinguished\r\ncompany, added: 'Hands of a dyer and cleaner.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, workman's hands,' retorted the minister, 'and I wish you many like\r\nthem. Believe me, they will do much to help the chief industry of your\r\ncity. Skilled as they are in chemical work, they are equally capable of\r\nwielding the pen, the pencil, the scalpel and the lens. As you here seem\r\nunaware of it, I am delighted to inform you.'\r\n\r\nThis time, I should have liked the ground to open and swallow me up.\r\nFortunately, the bell rang for the train to start. I said goodbye to the\r\nminister and, hurriedly taking to flight, left him laughing at the trick\r\nwhich he had played me.\r\n\r\nThe incident was noised about, could not help being so, for the\r\nperistyle of a railway station keeps no secrets. I then learned to what\r\nannoyances the shadow of the great exposes us. I was looked upon as an\r\ninfluential person, having the favor of the gods at my disposal. Place\r\nhunters and canvassers tormented me. One wanted a license to sell\r\ntobacco and stamps, another a scholarship for his son, another an\r\nincrease of his pension. I had only to ask and I should obtain, said\r\nthey.\r\n\r\nO simple people, what an illusion was yours! You could not have hit upon\r\na worse intermediary. I figuring as a postulant! I have many faults,\r\nI admit, but that is certainly not one of them. I got rid of the\r\nimportunate people as best I could, though they were utterly unable\r\nto fathom my reserve. What would they have said had they known of the\r\nminister's offers with regard to my laboratory and my jesting reply, in\r\nwhich I asked for a crocodile skin to hang from my ceiling! They would\r\nhave taken me for an idiot.\r\n\r\nSix months elapsed; and I received a letter summoning me to call upon\r\nthe minister at his office. I suspected a proposal to promote me to a\r\nmore important grammar school and wrote begging that I might be left\r\nwhere I was, among my vats and my insects. A second letter arrived,\r\nmore pressing than the first and signed by the minister's own hand. This\r\nletter said: 'Come at once, or I shall send my gendarmes to fetch you.'\r\n\r\nThere was no way out of it. Twenty-four hours later, I was in M. Duruy's\r\nroom. He welcomed me with exquisite cordiality, gave me his hand and,\r\ntaking up a number of the Moniteur: 'Read that,' he said. 'You refused\r\nmy chemical apparatus; but you won't refuse this.\r\n\r\nI looked at the line to which his finger pointed. I read my name in the\r\nlist of the Legion of Honor. Quite stupid with surprise, I stammered the\r\nfirst words of thanks that entered my head.\r\n\r\n'Come here,' said he, 'and let me give you the accolade. I will be your\r\nsponsor. You will like the ceremony all the better if it is held in\r\nprivate, between you and me: I know you!'\r\n\r\nHe pinned the red ribbon to my coat, kissed me on both cheeks, made me\r\ntelegraph the great event to my family. What a morning, spent with that\r\ngood man!\r\n\r\nI well know the vanity of decorative ribbonry and tinware, especially\r\nwhen, as too often happens, intrigue degrades the honor conferred; but,\r\ncoming as it did, that bit of ribbon is precious to me. It is a relic,\r\nnot an object for show. I keep it religiously in a drawer.\r\n\r\nThere was a parcel of big books on the table a collection of the reports\r\non the progress of science drawn up for the International Exhibition of\r\n1867, which had just closed.\r\n\r\n'Those books are for you,' continued the minister. 'Take them with you.\r\nYou can look through them at your leisure: they may interest you. There\r\nis something about your insects in them. You're to have this too: it\r\nwill pay for your journey. The trip which I made you take must not be\r\nat your own expense. If there is anything over, spend it on your\r\nlaboratory.'\r\n\r\nAnd he handed me a roll of twelve hundred francs. In vain I refused,\r\nremarking that my journey was not so burdensome as all that; besides,\r\nhis embrace and his bit of ribbon were of inestimable value compared\r\nwith my disbursements. He insisted: 'Take it,' he said, 'or I shall be\r\nvery angry. There's something else: you must come to the emperor's with\r\nme tomorrow, to the reception of the learned societies.'\r\n\r\nSeeing me greatly perplexed and as though demoralized by the prospect of\r\nan imperial interview: 'Don't try to escape me,' he said, 'or look out\r\nfor the gendarmes of my letter! You saw the fellows in the bearskin caps\r\non your way up. Mind you don't fall into their hands. In any case, lest\r\nyou should be tempted to run away, we will go to the Tuileries together,\r\nin my carriage.'\r\n\r\nThings happened as he wished. The next day, in the minister's company, I\r\nwas ushered into a little drawing room at the Tuileries by chamberlains\r\nin knee breeches and silver-buckled shoes. They were queer people to\r\nlook at. Their uniforms and their stiff gait gave them the appearance,\r\nin my eyes, of beetles who, by way of wing cases, wore a great,\r\ngold-laced dress coat, with a key in the small of the back. There were\r\nalready a score of persons from all parts waiting in the room. These\r\nincluded geographical explorers, botanists, geologists, antiquaries,\r\narcheologists, collectors of prehistoric flints, in short, the usual\r\nrepresentatives of provincial scientific life.\r\n\r\nThe emperor entered, very simply dressed, with no parade about him\r\nbeyond a wide, red, watered silk ribbon across his chest. No sign of\r\nmajesty, an ordinary man, round and plump, with a large moustache and\r\na pair of half-closed, drowsy eyelids. He moved from one to the other,\r\ntalking to each of us for a moment as the minister mentioned our\r\nnames and the nature of our occupations. He showed a fair amount of\r\ninformation as he changed his subject from the ice floes of Spitzbergen\r\nto the dunes of Gascony, from a Carlovingian charter to the flora of\r\nthe Sahara, from the progress in beetroot growing to Caesar's\r\ntrenches before Alesia. When my turn came, he questioned me upon the\r\nhypermetamorphosis of the Meloidae [a beetle family including the oil\r\nbeetle and the Spanish fly], my last essay in entomology. I answered as\r\nbest I could, floundering a little in the proper mode of address, mixing\r\nup the everyday monsieur with sire, a word whose use was so entirely new\r\nto me. I passed through the dread straits and others succeeded me. My\r\nfive minutes' conversation with an imperial majesty was, they tell me, a\r\nmost distinguished honor. I am quite ready to believe them, but I never\r\nhad a desire to repeat it.\r\n\r\nThe reception came to an end, bows were exchanged and we were dismissed.\r\nA luncheon awaited us at the minister's house. I sat on his right, not\r\na little embarrassed by the privilege; on his left was a physiologist\r\nof great renown. Like the others, I spoke of all manner of things,\r\nincluding even Avignon Bridge. Duruy's son, sitting opposite me, chaffed\r\nme pleasantly about the famous bridge on which everybody dances; he\r\nsmiled at my impatience to get back to the thyme-scented hills and the\r\ngray olive yards rich in Grasshoppers.\r\n\r\n'What!' said his father. 'Won't you visit our museums, our collections?\r\nThere are some very interesting things there.'\r\n\r\n'I know, monsieur le ministre, but I shall find better things, things\r\nmore to my taste, in the incomparable museum of the fields.'\r\n\r\n'Then what do you propose to do?'\r\n\r\n'I propose to go back tomorrow.\r\n\r\nI did go back, I had had enough of Paris: never had I felt such tortures\r\nof loneliness as in that immense whirl of humanity. To get away, to get\r\naway was my one idea.\r\n\r\nOnce home among my family, I felt a mighty load off my mind and a great\r\njoy in my heart, where rang a peal of bells proclaiming the delights of\r\nmy approaching emancipation. Little by little, the factory that was to\r\nset me free rose skywards, full of promises. Yes, I should possess the\r\nmodest income which would crown my ambition by allowing me to descant on\r\nanimals and plants in a university chair.\r\n\r\n'Well, no,' said Fate, 'you shall not acquire the freedman's peculium;\r\nyou shall remain a slave, dragging your chain behind you; your peal of\r\nbells rings false!'\r\n\r\nHardly was the factory in full swing when a piece of news was\r\nbruited, at first a vague rumor, an echo of probabilities rather than\r\ncertainties, and then a positive statement leaving no room for doubt.\r\nChemistry had obtained the madder dye by artificial means; thanks to a\r\nlaboratory concoction, it was utterly overthrowing the agriculture and\r\nindustries of my district. This result, while destroying my work and my\r\nhopes, did not surprise me unduly. I myself had toyed with the problem\r\nof artificial alizarin and I knew enough about it to foresee that, in\r\nno very distant future, the work of the chemist's retort would take the\r\nplace of the work of the fields.\r\n\r\nIt was finished; my hopes were dashed to the ground. What to do next?\r\nLet us change our lever and begin to roll Sisyphus' stone once more. Let\r\nus try to draw from the ink pot what the madder vat declines to yield.\r\nLaboremus!",
