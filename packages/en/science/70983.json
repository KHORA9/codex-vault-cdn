JANUARY, 1901               No. 3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  NOTES ON THE SELF-PRUNING OF TREES.\r\n\r\n                  JOHN H. SCHAFFNER AND FRED J. TYLER.\r\n\r\nIn a dense forest of growing trees the smaller, side branches of the\r\nmain stem, as well as those of the larger branches, are continually\r\ndying off. But the tree rids itself of these dead branches by forming a\r\ncollar of tissue from the cambium layer around the base of the branch,\r\nwhich presses more tightly as layer after layer of living wood is\r\nadded, until the branch finally falls off and the hole which is left is\r\ngrown over in a short time. This process is known as natural pruning.\r\nBut the process which we wish to consider is very different from this,\r\nand we desire to distinguish it by the term, self-pruning. In this case\r\nthe living branches are cut off or else the cutting-off process is the\r\ncause of the death of the branch. A special adaptation is provided\r\nto accomplish the result and the process is one whose purpose is the\r\nshedding of the branches rather than the attempt to accommodate the\r\nplant to conditions of injury brought about by other causes. In a\r\nnumber of species perfectly formed winter buds were developed on the\r\nbranches which were shed, and so far as our observations go, the twigs\r\nare cast in the fall and winter.\r\n\r\nAlthough the shedding of branches is well known, especially in the\r\nconifers, not as much notice has been taken of it as we think it\r\ndeserves. We have been taking observations for several years and have\r\nbeen partly anticipated by Dr. Bessey in a note in _Science_ 12. 650,\r\n1900,--Botanical Notes--The Annual Shedding of Cottonwood Twigs.\r\nBessey describes the shedding of the twigs of Populus deltoides as\r\noccurring about the middle of October, and after giving the details\r\nof the process, concludes as follows: “It is an interesting fact that\r\nthe Tamarisks (Tamarix sp.) which are held by some botanists to be\r\nclosely related to the Poplars, shed their twigs by exactly the same\r\ndevice as that described above. In the Tamarisks the shedding of the\r\ntwigs is a part of the annual process of defoliation, their leaves\r\nbeing so small that it appears to be less trouble and expense to\r\ndrop twig and all than to separate every individual leaf. Possibly in\r\nthe Cottonwoods, with their large leaves, we have a survival of the\r\nTamarisk twig-shedding habit long after its original significance has\r\ndisappeared.” Dr. Bessey, however, we believe, will not insist on this\r\nsupposition when he considers that the same thing occurs in species of\r\nPrunus, Quercus, and other widely separated genera.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1--Twig of Populus alba, showing large\r\nbasal joint and scars where smaller twigs have been detached.\r\n\r\nFIG. 2--View of basal joint of same twig as Fig. 1.\r\n\r\nFIG. 3--Twig of Salix nigra, showing position of the brittle\r\nzone (_a_).\r\n\r\nFIG. 4--Green twig of Ampelopsis cordata, showing joints (_a_)\r\nat the leaf nodes.]\r\n\r\nThe self-pruning of twigs from woody stems, so far as our observations\r\ngo at present, is accomplished in three general ways: 1st, by the\r\nformation of a single joint close to the parent branch; 2nd, by the\r\nformation of a brittle zone near the base of the limbs which are to\r\nbe shed; 3rd, by a series of transverse joints corresponding to the\r\nleaf nodes. Among the plants which come in the first class, the most\r\nstriking perhaps, is Populus alba, in which very large branches are\r\nfrequently cut off in such a perfect manner that one might think the\r\npruning had been done with a sharp knife. Green twigs from one to\r\nfifteen years old were found to be shed and no doubt still older ones\r\nare cut off. The twigs have well-developed winter buds and this is also\r\nthe case in other species of Populus and in certain species of Quercus\r\nand Prunus. In Quercus alba shed twigs were found from one to four\r\nyears old while in Q. acuminata there were some seven years of age. In\r\nPrunus serotina twigs from one to six years old were cut off. In Ulmus\r\nAmericana not only are joints formed at the base of the twigs, but the\r\ntwigs also break apart at the nodes, caused by annual growth.\r\n\r\n                 *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following species were found belonging to the first class:\r\n\r\n        Populus alba L.\r\n          “     deltoides Marsh.\r\n          “     grandidentata Mx.\r\n          “     tremuloides Mx.\r\n          ”     dilatata Ait.\r\n        Quercus alba L.\r\n          “     robur L.\r\n          “     macrocarpa Mx.\r\n          “     acuminata (Mx.) Sarg.\r\n        Ulmus americana, L.\r\n        Prunus serotina, Ehrh.\r\n        Tamarix gallica L.\r\n        Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carr.\r\n\r\nAll the plants found with brittle zones belonged to the willows. It is\r\ninteresting to note that the branches shed may be one to several years\r\nof age and that certain branches do not develop a brittle zone. Salix\r\nnigra and S. amygdaloides seem to show the character most perfectly and\r\nit is remarkable to see how readily the branches drop off.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following species show the adaptation:\r\n\r\n        Salix nigra Marsh.\r\n          “   amygdaloides anders.\r\n          “   fragilis L.\r\n          “   alba vitellina (L.) Koch.\r\n          “   babylonica L.\r\n\r\nAmong those which come in the third class, the most remarkable plant\r\nobserved was Ampelopsis cordata. About the time that the leaves are\r\nshed nearly all the slender green branches literally fall to pieces and\r\ndrop off. Most of the fruit is on these branches and the berries are\r\nthus shed at the same time. In the winter the plant is remarkable for\r\nthe few branches left and it looks like an artificially pruned vine.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe species observed belonging to this class are the following:\r\n\r\n        Ampelopsis cordata Mx.\r\n            “      tricuspidata Seib. & Zucc.\r\n        Parthenocissus quinquefolia (L.) Planch.\r\n\r\nThe shedding of the twigs of woody plants may in many cases be entirely\r\nan adaptation to get rid of the leaves as in the case of the dwarf\r\nbranches of Pines and the young twigs of Tamarisks. But even in the\r\nTamarisks it is doubtful whether the joints formed in the older\r\nbranches can be claimed to have such a purpose, since in this case the\r\nleaves have all been shed with the annual twigs. The shedding of the\r\nold woody branches may have a different purpose. In regard to the trees\r\nmentioned above, we think that the process is one primarily to rid the\r\ntree of surplus branches. This would manifestly be an advantage and\r\nwould give room and opportunity for the development of many young leafy\r\nshoots every year without accumulating too great a mass of useless\r\nmembers. This is certainly the case with the poplars and the willows.\r\nIn no case do we think it admissible to say that the adaptation is\r\nprimarily for the purpose of propagation, although this may be a very\r\nimportant incidental result in such plants as the willows when growing\r\nin wet places. In the case of Ampelopsis cordata, the only reasonable\r\nexplanation seems to be a preparation for the winter condition, since\r\nthe branches which are shed do not ripen and the plant has an admirable\r\nmethod for shedding its leaves. The slender branches would be in great\r\ndanger of being killed by the cold of winter. The shedding of the young\r\nbranches of Taxodium distichum (L.) Rich. is remarkably like that in\r\nTamarix. The slender, dwarf branches clothed with the leaves drop off\r\nin the fall or the following spring. The habit must be quite ancient,\r\nas such branches of Taxodium distichum miocenum Hr. are very abundantly\r\npreserved as fossils. In Taxodium mexicanum Carr. the dwarf branches\r\nare not shed until the second year. Glyptostrobus pendulus Endl. and G.\r\nheterophyllus Endl. also have deciduous dwarf branches. There are other\r\nconifers and no doubt many other angiospermous trees which possess\r\nthese interesting adaptations and by careful observations, no doubt\r\nmany interesting ecological facts will be brought to light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             PLANT NAMES COMMEMORATIVE OF OHIO BOTANISTS.\r\n\r\n                           CLARA ARMSTRONG.\r\n\r\n\r\nThough Ohio has had fewer botanists than many other States, some of\r\nthese became known wherever botany was cultivated. Riddell was one of\r\nthe pioneer botanists of the west and for six years he was a resident\r\nof this State. By the publication of his _Synopsis_ he contributed\r\nlargely to Ohio Botany. The names of Sullivant and Lesquereux shed\r\nstill greater luster on our state. Most of the work of the former and\r\nall of that of the latter was done in Ohio. Several others whose names\r\nare given below have been industrious students of our Flora, and have\r\nspent many years if not all their lives within our territory. It is a\r\nlong and interesting list of botanical names which commemorates their\r\nscientific labors. In the preparation of this paper I have been aided\r\nmaterially by Prof. W. A. Kellerman.\r\n\r\nJOHN LEONARD RIDDELL.--Born in Leyden, Mass., Feb. 20th, 1807;\r\ndied in New Orleans, La., Oct. 7, 1863. He graduated from Rensseler\r\nInstitute, Troy, N. Y. He came to Ohio in 1830 and became professor\r\nof Botany and adjunct Professor of Chemistry in the Medical College\r\nof Cincinnati. He was an enthusiastic and industrious botanist, and\r\ncollected extensively in many parts of our State. Scarcely any of his\r\nspecimens seem now to be in existence though he prepared sets for sale\r\nand accumulated a large herbarium. His most important publication was\r\nthe Synopsis of the Flora of the Western States. He also published a\r\nSupplementary Catalogue of Ohio Plants. In 1836 he left Ohio, carrying\r\nhis botanical specimens to New Orleans where he became professor in\r\na Medical College; he was also in the employ of the government until\r\nhis death. He furnished many notes and longer articles to scientific\r\njournals and was the author of many new species of plants. The\r\nfollowing have been named in his honor:\r\n\r\n        Riddellia, synonym of Psilostrophe, a genus of the Compositae\r\n          family.\r\n        Solidago Riddellii, a species of Golden Rod.\r\n        Senecio Riddellii, synonym of S. Douglasii, a species of\r\n          Compositae.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM STARLING SULLIVANT.--Born in Franklinton, Ohio, Jan.\r\n18, 1803, died in Columbus, Ohio, April 30, 1873. He was educated\r\nat Ohio University and Yale. The death of his father at the time of\r\nhis graduation prevented him from studying for one of the learned\r\nprofessions and he became a surveyor and practical engineer, which\r\noccupation he followed until late in life. During this time he\r\ncollected and studied the plants of central Ohio, and in 1840 he\r\nbegan to pay particular attention to Mosses; this became the subject\r\nof his special study, and he was soon recognized as the most eminent\r\nbryologist that this country has ever produced.\r\n\r\nIn 1864 the degree of LL.D. was conferred on Sullivant by Gambier\r\nCollege. He was elected to membership in many scientific societies both\r\nin the United States and Europe. At his death his bryological books,\r\ncollections and preparations of Mosses were given to the Gray Herbarium\r\nof Harvard University. The remainder of his botanical library was\r\nbequeathed to the Ohio State University then called the Agricultural\r\nand Mechanical College. His microscopes were given to Starling Medical\r\nCollege. Of this institution he was senior trustee. He was the author\r\nof many new species and the plants named for him by other botanists are\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n    Sullivantia, a genus of the Saxifrages. The name first proposed\r\n        by Gray (1840) for the species discovered by Sullivant was\r\n        Saxifraga Sullivantii; two years later Gray established the\r\n        genus Sullivantia and published the name of the plant in\r\n        question as Sullivantia Ohionis. According to the rules of\r\n        priority that name now stands as Sullivantia Sullivantii.\r\n    Discina Sullivantii, a species of discomycetous fungi.\r\n    Panus Sullivantii, a species of Agaricineae.\r\n    Lentinus Sullivantii, a species of Agaricineae.\r\n    Marasmius Sullivantii, a species of Agaricineae.\r\n    Psilocybe Sullivantii, a species of Agaricineae.\r\n    Boletus Sullivantii, a species of the Polyporeae.\r\n    Polystictus Sullivantii, a species of the Polyporeae.\r\n    Thelephora Sullivantii, a species of the Thelephoreae.\r\n    Cephalozia Sullivantii, a species of Liverwort.\r\n    Jubula Sullivantii, a species of Liverwort.\r\n    Kantia Sullivantii, a species of Liverwort.\r\n    Porella Sullivantii, a species of Liverwort.\r\n    Hypnum Sullivantii, a species of Moss.\r\n    Astomum Sullivantii, a species of Moss.\r\n    Amphoridium Sullivantii, a species of Moss.\r\n    Brachythecium Sullivantii, a species of Moss.\r\n    Bruchia Sullivantii, a species of Moss.\r\n    Cylindrothecium Sullivantii, a species of Moss.\r\n    Fontinalis Sullivantii, a species of Moss.\r\n    Macromitrium Sullivantii, a species of Moss.\r\n    Neckera Sullivantii, a species of Moss.\r\n    Phascum Sullivantii, a species of Moss.\r\n    Pleuridium Sullivantii, a species of Moss.\r\n    Schlotheimia Sullivantii, a species of Moss.\r\n    Eurhynchium Sullivantii, a species of Moss.\r\n    Hookeria Sullivantii, a species of Moss. Zygodon Sullivantii, a\r\n        species of Moss.\r\n    Sphagnum Sullivantianum, a species of Moss.\r\n    Asclepias Sullivantii, a species of Milkweed.\r\n    Lonicera Sullivantii, a species of Honeysuckle.\r\n    Carex Sullivantii, a species of Sedge.\r\n    Callipteridium Sullivantii, a fossil plant.\r\n\r\nThere were also two species of Mosses named for Mrs. Sullivant as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    Hypnum Sullivantiae, a pleurocarpous Moss.\r\n    Plagiothecium Sullivantiae, a pleurocarpous Moss.\r\n\r\nLEO LESQUEREUX.--Born in Fleurier, Switzerland, Nov. 18,\r\n1806, died in Columbus, Ohio, Oct. 25, 1889. On entering the Academy\r\nof Neuchatel he met Arnold Guyot and together they became devoted to\r\nnatural science. In 1822 he went to Eisenach preparatory to entering\r\nthe University of Berlin, supporting himself by teaching French. He\r\nwas principal of a college at Chaux de Fonds but had to give this up\r\non account of deafness. From this time he did engraving, made watch\r\nsprings, and studied Mosses and fossil plants.\r\n\r\nIn 1848 Lesquereux came to America settling at Cambridge, where he\r\nassisted Louis Agassiz; but he soon removed to Columbus, Ohio, where\r\nhe lived until his death. He was a worthy associate of William S.\r\nSullivant to whom in fact he was indebted by the most commendable\r\ngenerosity. He was a paleo-botanist and a student of Mosses. Many\r\nplants are named for him including a large number of fossil forms.\r\n\r\n    Lesquerella, a genus of Cruciferae.\r\n    Lesquereuxia, synonym of Siphonostegia, a genus of\r\n        Scrophulariaceae.\r\n    Hysterographium Lesquereuxii, a species of Pyrenomycetous Fungi.\r\n    Webera Lescuriana, a species of Moss.\r\n    Bryum Lescurianum, a species of Moss.\r\n    Archidium Lescurii, a species of Moss.\r\n    Atrichum Lescurii, a species of Moss.\r\n    Fontinalis Lescurii, a species of Moss.\r\n    Hypnum Lescurii, a species of Moss.\r\n    Orthotrichum Lescurii, a species of Moss.\r\n    Sphagnum Lescurii, a species of Moss.\r\n    Thelia Lescurii, a species of Moss.\r\n    Alyssum Lescurii, a species of the Mustard Family.\r\n    Lepidophoroxs Lesquereuxii, a fossil plant.\r\n    Lepidodendrum Lesquereuxii, synonym of L. clypeatum, a fossil\r\n        plant.\r\n    Sphenopteris Lesquereuxii, a fossil plant.\r\n    Sphaerites Lesquereuxii, a fossil plant.\r\n    Persoonia Lesquereuxii, a fossil plant.\r\n    Buthotrephis Lesquereuxii, a fossil plant.\r\n    Pecopteris Lesquereuxii, a fossil plant.\r\n    Cardiocarpon Lescurianum, a fossil plant.\r\n    Triphyllopteris Lescuri, a fossil plant.\r\n    Odontopteris Lescurii, a fossil plant.\r\n    Sigillaria Lescurii, a fossil plant.\r\n    Sphenopteris Lescuriana, a fossil plant.\r\n    Taeniopteris Lescuriana, a fossil plant.\r\n    Triphyllopteris Lescuriana, a fossil plant.\r\n    Rhabdocarpus Lescurianus, a fossil plant.\r\n    Thinfeldia Lesquereuxiana, a fossil plant.\r\n    Laurinoxylon Lesquereuxiana, a fossil plant.\r\n\r\nJOHN STRONG NEWBERRY.--Born at Windsor, Conn., Dec. 22, 1822,\r\ndied in New York, Dec. 7, 1892. He graduated from Western Reserve\r\nCollege 1846 and from Cleveland Medical College 1848. He studied abroad\r\nfor two years and then practiced medicine in Cleveland until 1855\r\nwhen he was appointed acting Surgeon and Geologist to an exploring\r\nexpedition through the country between San Francisco and the Columbia\r\nRiver. He went on several of these expeditions studying the botanical,\r\nzoological, and geological features of the country. In 1869 he was\r\nappointed Chief Geologist to the Geological Survey of Ohio.\r\n\r\nIn 1859 Newberry published the first State Catalogue of Ohio Plants.\r\nAbout 1865 he was made professor of Geology and palaeontology at\r\nColumbia College School of Mines which position he held until his\r\ndeath. His chief botanical work was in palaeo-botany though quite a\r\nnumber of living plants as well as many fossil species commemorate his\r\nname.\r\n\r\n    Newberrya, a genus of the Indian Pipe Family.\r\n    Gentiana Newberryi, a species of Gentian.\r\n    Abutilon Newberryi, a species of Malvaceae.\r\n    Leptosyne Newberryi, a species of Compositae.\r\n    Pentstemon Newberryi, synonym of P. menziesii, a species of\r\n        Scrophulariaceae.\r\n    Potentilla Newberryi, synonym of Ivesia gracillis, a species of\r\n        Rosaceae.\r\n    Ferula Newberryi, synonym of Peucedanum Newberryi, a species\r\n        Umbellifereae.\r\n    Astagolyous (Oxytropis) Newberryi, a species of the Leguminous\r\n        Family.\r\n    Notholaena Newberryi, a species of Fern.\r\n    Physaria Newberryi, a species of Fern.

C. BEARDSLEE.--Born in Connecticut. Died December, 1884, in\r\nPainesville, O. He came to Ohio and became a practicing physician at\r\nPainesville. He published the second State Catalogue of Ohio Plants in\r\n1874. This was a pamphlet of nineteen pages; it was reprinted in the\r\nState Agricultural reports of 1877. After his death Dr. Beardslee’s\r\nherbarium of about 4000 species, especially rich in Carices, Grasses,\r\nand Salices, was given to Oberlin College. The following species was\r\nnamed in his honor:\r\n\r\n    Chantransia violacea Beardslei, a species of fresh-water Alga.\r\n\r\nANDREW PRICE MORGAN.--Born at Centerville near Dayton, Oct.\r\n27, 1836, now living in Hamilton County. He has done much toward the\r\ndevelopment of Mycology in this country. He has made known a large\r\nnumber of higher fungi of the south-eastern part of Ohio. He is the\r\nauthor of many new species. A number of plants belonging to the group\r\nof Fungi have been named in his honor, as follows:\r\n\r\n    Boletus Morgani, a species of Polyporeae.\r\n    Polyporus Morgani, a species of Polyporeae.\r\n    Lepiota Morgani, a species of Leucosporeae.\r\n    Russela Morgani, a species of Leucosporeae.\r\n    Cantharellus Morgani, a species of Leucosporeae.\r\n    Hypoxylon Morgani, a species of Pyrenomycetaceae.\r\n\r\nThere is also one species of Agaricineae named for Mrs. Morgan:\r\n\r\n    Hygrophorus Laurae, a species of Fungus.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM ASHBROOK KELLERMAN.--Born at Ashville, Ohio May 1,\r\n1850. He was educated at Cornell and the German Universities, receiving\r\nthe degree of Ph.D. in 1881.\r\n\r\nFor a time he was teacher of natural science in the Wisconsin State\r\nNormal School, later was professor of Botany and Zoology at the\r\nKansas Agricultural College, State Botanist of Kansas, and Botanist\r\nof the Kansas Experiment Station. He was the founder and editor (for\r\nfour years) of the Journal of Mycology. He has held the position of\r\nProfessor of Botany in the Ohio State University since 1890 and is the\r\nauthor of a number of text-books and articles for botanical journals.\r\nHe has accumulated a very large and valuable private Herbarium of\r\nparasitic fungi, and a State Herbarium of the Flora of Ohio for the\r\nOhio State University that already numbers many thousands of mounted\r\nsheets. The names given by botanists complimentary to his work are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    Kellermannia, a genus of Sphaeropsideous fungi.\r\n    Aecidium Kellermannii, a species of Uredineae.\r\n    Plasmopora Kellermannii, a species of Phycomycetous Fungi.\r\n    Rosellinia Kellermannii, a species of Sphaeriaceous Fungi.\r\n    Rhabdospora Kellermannii, a species of Sphaeropsideous Fungi.\r\n    Diaporthe Kellermanniana, a species of Pyrenomycetous Fungi.\r\n    Physcomitrium Kellermani, a species of acrocarpous Moss.\r\n\r\nMISS H. F. BIDDLECOME.--Of Columbus, formerly of Springfield,\r\nassiduously collected and studied the flora of Greene and Champaign\r\ncounties, Ohio. She discovered a species of Moss and one of Liverwort\r\nwhich have been named in her honor.\r\n\r\n    Bryum Biddlecomiae, a pleurocarpous Moss.\r\n    Trichocolea Biddlecomiae, a species of Hepaticae, or Liverwort.\r\n\r\nF. D. KELSEY.--Born at New Washington, Ind., Feb. 15, 1849,\r\nbut early moved to southern Ohio where he lived until 1856, when he\r\nmoved to Columbus. He was graduated from Marietta College in 1870. The\r\nnext year he went to Andover Theological Seminary where he graduated\r\nin 1874. He served Congregational Churches until 1885 when he moved to\r\nHelena, Montana. Here he made collections and distributed the local\r\nflora. The College of Montana conferred on him the degree of Sc. D.\r\n\r\nIn 1892 he was elected Professor of Botany at Oberlin College, which\r\nposition he held until 1897, when he accepted the pastorate of the\r\nCentral Congregational Church in Toledo, which he now holds. He is\r\nalso lecturer on Botany at the Smead School for Girls at Toledo, Ohio.\r\nWhile professor at Oberlin he published several bulletins of local\r\ninterest, and one monograph of Uncinula, with microscopic drawings of\r\nall American species. There are several species named in his honor, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    Kelseya, a monotypic genus of Rosaceae.\r\n    Cucurbitaria Kelseyi, a species of Pyrenomycetous fungi.\r\n    Homostegia Kelseyi, a species of Pyrenomycetous fungi.\r\n    Cryptanthe Kelseyi, a species of Boraginaceae.\r\n    Phlox Kelseyi, a species of Polemoniaceae.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE MAXIMUM HEIGHT OF PLANTS. II.\r\n\r\n                      JOHN H. SCHAFFNER.\r\n\r\n\r\nLast spring the writer published a few measurements of some common\r\nwestern plants in the Asa Gray Bulletin (Vol. 8: 19-20). A few other\r\nmeasurements are given below, all from Kansas except four which are\r\nfrom Ohio. It would be well for all collectors to keep records of\r\nthe size of the plants which they meet, including measurements of\r\nthe height and also dimensions of the leaves, flowers, fruits and\r\nunderground parts. In this way the manual of the future may be brought\r\nto represent more accurately the living plant as it grows in nature\r\nrather than the dried, shrunken and dwarf specimens of the herbarium.\r\n\r\n   =========================================+=====+=======+========\r\n                                            |Gray |Britton|Measured\r\n                                            |     |       |  Feet\r\n   -----------------------------------------+-----+-------+--------\r\n   Agropyrum repens (L.)

GRIGGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first list of Campus birds was published by the Wheaton Club in the\r\n“Agricultural Student” for March, 1898. Since that time a number of\r\nadditional species have been reported and it has been thought advisable\r\nto republish the entire list, inserting the additions in their proper\r\nplaces. The list below contains 137 species. It is compiled from the\r\nrecords of the Wheaton Club, excepting those species for which Prof. J.\r\nR. Taylor is given credit. Only those species of which nests, eggs, or\r\nfledgelings have been observed are reported as breeding. The names are\r\npreceded by the A. O. U. check list number. Further additions will be\r\npublished from time to time.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Ord. PYGOPODES.\r\n\r\n                      Fam. PODICIPIDAE. GREBES.\r\n\r\n         6.

No. 1.\r\n\r\n                           W. A. KELLERMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn introductory paragraph to this series may be short as will be the\r\nnotes that follow. Suffice therefore to say that from time to time the\r\nfield jottings and short notes of observations on the plants of our\r\nState flora will be presented. Not only those made myself but others\r\nwhich may be kindly communicated to me for this purpose by botanists,\r\namateurs, students and other observers will find a place in the series.\r\nAn especial invitation is extended to pupils in our High Schools and to\r\nteachers throughout the State to contribute suitable material which in\r\nmany cases may be of great interest and importance. Sub-heads will be\r\nused thus making it possible to scan the notes easily.\r\n\r\nPUCCINIA SMILACIS.--This Black Rust which has the various\r\nspecies of Green Briar for its host, was noticed in extraordinary\r\nquantity the past season in Scioto, Adams and Brown Counties. It\r\nwas abundant only on Smilax glauca--called in that region the Saw\r\nBrier--but not uncommonly occurred on S. hispida and S. rotundifolia.\r\nIt was also remarkable in this respect namely that the teleutospores\r\n(the black or winter spores) were excessively abundant: the uredospores\r\n(red or summer spores) could be found only when search was made. The\r\nobservation here recorded pertains to the first half of the month\r\nof November. I have occasionally noticed uredospores in quantity on\r\nSmilax leaves in the various parts of Ohio but never before found the\r\nwinter-spores common. It should perhaps be added parenthetically that\r\n_Dicœoma_ having the priority over Puccinia is really the generic\r\nname that should be used, but the commoner designation may here be\r\ntolerated.\r\n\r\nQUERCUS ACUMINATA.--The Chestnut or Yellow Oak (name in Gray’s Manual\r\nQuercus Muhlenbergii) is described as “a tall tree with thin _flaky_\r\nbark” (Gray), or “a tree with gray _flaky_ bark” (Britton); and in fact\r\nmany of the White Oaks are said to have “_flaky_” bark. The Quercus\r\nacuminata is very abundant in central Ohio and is of common occurrence\r\nin many parts of the State. It is rare that the “flakiness” of the bark\r\nor a tendency to separate in plates, is pronounced or conspicuous in\r\nour Chestnut Oak trees. The single good example I have found is here\r\nshown in Fig. 1 reproduced from a photograph of a specimen growing in\r\nHayden’s ravine near Columbus. Both trees shown are the same species\r\nbut the smaller one has merely furrowed, not flaky, bark, and it is\r\na fair representative of the trunks of this Oak as they occur in our\r\nvicinity. The usual form of bark is perhaps more clearly shown in\r\nFig. 2, which is from a photograph of a large tree standing near the\r\nHorticultural Hall of the Ohio State University. This specimen has\r\nleaves remarkably narrow for Q. acuminata but the trunk is similar in\r\nappearance to the trees which have broad leaves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 1._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 2._]\r\n\r\nHELIANTHUS MAXIMILIANI.--Maximilian’s Sunflower whose habitat\r\nand range are given in Britton and Brown’s Illustrated Flora as “on\r\ndry prairies, Minnesota, and Manitoba to the Northwest Territory,\r\nNebraska and Texas” may be said to be out of place in Ohio. Yet Mr. R.\r\nF. Griggs found it (a single plant) in the season of 1900 (cf. O.\r\nS. U. NATURALIST, 1:16) at Sandusky, Erie County. In a package of\r\ninteresting plants sent to the State Herbarium recently by Mr. Otto\r\nHacker, fine herbarium specimens of this conspicuous species were\r\nfurnished. Mr. Hacker says that he observed it near Painesville (Lake\r\nCounty) six or seven years ago by railway tracks, where it is still\r\nflourishing.\r\n\r\nLOTUS CORNICULATUS.--This European Lotus, with such common\r\nnames as Bird’s foot, Trefoil, Ground Honeysuckle, Bloom-fell,\r\nCrowtoes, Cat’s-clover, and Sheepfoot, was collected at Painesville\r\nby Mr. Otto Hacker in nursery grounds. This is the second time this\r\nwaif has been recorded for Ohio, the first case being reported by Mr.\r\nRicksecker, of Oberlin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            NEWS AND NOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\nProf. Thomas A. Williams, editor-in-chief of the Asa Gray Bulletin and\r\nassistant chief of the Division of Agrostology, U. S. Department of\r\nAgriculture, died on the morning of Dec. 23, 1900.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the 10th annual meeting of the Ohio State Academy of Science, held\r\nat Columbus, on December 26 and 27, thirty-one papers were read--12\r\npertaining to botany, 8 to zoology, 6 to geology, 3 to meteorology, and\r\n2 to anthropology. The following are the officers for the coming year:\r\nPresident, August D. Selby, Wooster; 1st Vice Pres., Rev. H. Herzer,\r\nMarietta; 2nd Vice Pres, Mrs. W. A.

NATURALIST, it has been thought best\r\nto make a slight change by dropping the words, State University.\r\nAlthough a change in name is unfortunate it will not be very serious\r\nat the present time and hereafter the name will be THE OHIO\r\nNATURALIST, which is perhaps more descriptive of the scope of the\r\njournal and much better for purposes of citation.\r\n\r\n                                                           J.
