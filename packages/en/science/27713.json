This is a self-evident proposition that needs no emphasis,\r\nyet I venture to believe that the former collection of tried and proved\r\nmethods has already been of some utility, not only to the student in the\r\nabsence of his teacher, but also to isolated workers in laboratories far\r\nremoved from centres of instruction, reminding them of forgotten details\r\nin methods already acquired. If this assumption is based on fact no\r\nfurther apology is needed for the present revised edition in which the\r\nchanges are chiefly in the nature of additions--rendered necessary by\r\nthe introduction of new methods during recent years.\r\n\r\nI take this opportunity of expressing my deep sense of obligation to my\r\nconfrere in the Physiological Department of our medical school--Mr. J.\r\nH. Ryffel, B. C., B. Sc.--who has revised those pages dealing with the\r\nanalysis of the metabolic products of bacterial life; to successive\r\ncolleagues in the Bacteriological Department of Guy's Hospital, for\r\ntheir ready co-operation in working out or in testing new methods; and\r\nfinally to my Chief Laboratory Assistant, Mr. J. C. Turner whose\r\nassistance and experience have been of the utmost value to me in the\r\npreparation of this volume. I have also to thank Mrs. Constant Ponder\r\nfor many of the new line drawings and for redrawing a number of the\r\noriginal cuts.\r\n\r\n    JOHN W. H. EYRE.\r\n\r\n    GUY'S HOSPITAL, S. E.\r\n    _July, 1913._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the following pages I have endeavoured to arrange briefly and\r\nconcisely the various methods at present in use for the study of\r\nbacteria, and the elucidation of such points in their life-histories as\r\nare debatable or still undetermined.\r\n\r\nOf these methods, some are new, others are not; but all are reliable,\r\nonly such having been included as are capable of giving satisfactory\r\nresults even in the hands of beginners. In fact, the bulk of the matter\r\nis simply an elaboration of the typewritten notes distributed to some of\r\nmy laboratory classes in practical and applied bacteriology;\r\nconsequently an attempt has been made to present the elements of\r\nbacteriological technique in their logical sequence.\r\n\r\nI make no apology for the space devoted to illustrations, nearly all of\r\nwhich have been prepared especially for this volume; for a picture, if\r\ngood, possesses a higher educational value and conveys a more accurate\r\nimpression than a page of print; and even sketches of apparatus serve a\r\ndistinct purpose in suggesting to the student those alterations and\r\nmodifications which may be rendered necessary or advisable by the\r\ncharacter of his laboratory equipment.\r\n\r\nThe excellent and appropriate terminology introduced by Chester in his\r\nrecent work on \"Determinative Bacteriology\" I have adopted in its\r\nentirety, for I consider it only needs to be used to convince one of its\r\nextreme utility, whilst its inclusion in an elementary manual is\r\ncalculated to induce in the student habits of accurate observation and\r\nconcise description.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of Section XVII--\"Outlines for the Study of\r\nPathogenic Bacteria\"--introduced with the idea of completing the volume\r\nfrom the point of view of the medical and dental student, the work has\r\nbeen arranged to allow of its use as a laboratory guide by the technical\r\nstudent generally, whether of brewing, dairying, or agriculture.\r\n\r\nSo alive am I to its many inperfections that it appears almost\r\nsuperfluous to state that the book is in no sense intended as a rival to\r\nthe many and excellent manuals of bacteriology at present in use, but\r\naims only at supplementing the usually scanty details of technique, and\r\nat instructing the student how to fit up and adapt apparatus for his\r\ndaily work, and how to carry out thoroughly and systematically the\r\nvarious bacterioscopical analyses that are daily demanded of the\r\nbacteriologist by the hygienist.\r\n\r\nFinally, it is with much pleasure that I acknowledge the valuable\r\nassistance received from my late assistant, Mr. J. B. Gall, A. I. C., in\r\nthe preparation of the section dealing with the chemical products of\r\nbacterial life, and which has been based upon the work of Lehmann.\r\n\r\n    JOHN W. H.

LABORATORY REGULATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following regulations are laid down for observance in the\r\nBacteriological Laboratories under the direction of the author. Similar\r\nregulations should be enforced in all laboratories where pathogenic\r\nbacteria are studied.\r\n\r\n     _Guy's Hospital._\r\n\r\n\r\n     ~BACTERIOLOGICAL DEPARTMENT.~\r\n\r\n     HANDLING OF INFECTIVE MATERIALS.\r\n\r\n     The following Regulations have been drawn up in the interest\r\n     of those working in the Laboratory as well as the public at\r\n     large, and will be strictly enforced.\r\n\r\n     Their object is to avoid the dangers of infection which may\r\n     arise from neglect of necessary precautions or from\r\n     carelessness.\r\n\r\n     Everyone must note that by neglecting the general rules laid\r\n     down he not only runs grave risk himself, but is a danger to\r\n     others.\r\n\r\n     REGULATIONS.\r\n\r\n     1. Each worker must wear a gown or overall, provided at his\r\n     own expense, which must be kept in the Laboratory.\r\n\r\n     2. The hands must be disinfected with lysol 2 per cent.\r\n     solution, carbolic acid 5 per cent. solution, or corrosive\r\n     sublimate 1 per mille solution, after dealing with\r\n     infectious material, and ~before using towels~.\r\n\r\n     3. On no account must Laboratory towels or dusters be used\r\n     for wiping up infectious material, and if such towels or\r\n     dusters do become soiled, they must be immediately\r\n     sterilised by boiling.\r\n\r\n     4. Special pails containing disinfectant are provided to\r\n     receive any waste material, and nothing must be thrown on\r\n     the floor.\r\n\r\n     5. All instruments must be flamed, boiled, or otherwise\r\n     disinfected immediately after use.\r\n\r\n     6. Labels must be moistened with water, and not by the\r\n     mouth.\r\n\r\n     7. All disused cover-glasses, slides, and pipettes after use\r\n     in handling infectious material, etc., must be placed in 2\r\n     per cent. lysol solution. A vessel is supplied on each bench\r\n     for this purpose.\r\n\r\n     8. All plate and tube cultures of pathogenic organisms when\r\n     done with, must be placed for immediate disinfection in the\r\n     boxes provided for the purpose.\r\n\r\n     9. No fluids are to be discharged into sinks or drains\r\n     unless previously disinfected.\r\n\r\n     10. Animals are to be dissected only after being nailed out\r\n     on the wooden boards, and their skin thoroughly washed with\r\n     disinfectant solution.\r\n\r\n     11. Immediately after the post-mortem examination is\r\n     completed each cadaver must be placed in the zinc\r\n     animal-box--_without removing the carcase from the\r\n     post-mortem board_--and the cover of the box replaced, ready\r\n     for carriage to the destructor.\r\n\r\n     12. Dead animals, when done with, are cremated in the\r\n     destructor, and the laboratory attendant must be notified\r\n     when the bodies are ready for cremation.\r\n\r\n     13. None of the workers in the laboratory are allowed to\r\n     enter the animal houses unless accompanied by the special\r\n     attendant in charge, who must scrupulously observe the same\r\n     directions regarding personal disinfection as the workers in\r\n     the laboratories.\r\n\r\n     14. No cultures are to be taken out of the laboratory\r\n     without the permission of the head of the Department.\r\n\r\n     15. All accidents, such as spilling infected material,\r\n     cutting or pricking the fingers, must be at once reported to\r\n     the bacteriologist in charge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. GLASS APPARATUS IN COMMON USE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe equipment of the bacteriological laboratory, so far as the glass\r\napparatus is concerned, differs but little from that of a chemical\r\nlaboratory, and the cleanliness of the apparatus is equally important.\r\nThe glassware comprised in the following list, in addition to being\r\nclean, must be stored in a sterile or germ-free condition.\r\n\r\n~Test-tubes.~--It is convenient to keep several sizes of test-tubes in\r\nstock, to meet special requirements, viz.:\r\n\r\n1. ~18 x 1.5~ cm., to contain media for ordinary tube cultivations.\r\n\r\n2. ~18 x 1.3~ cm., to contain media used for pouring plate cultivations,\r\nand also for holding sterile \"swabs.\"\r\n\r\n3. ~18 x 2~ cm., to contain wedges of potato, beetroot, or other vegetable\r\nmedia.\r\n\r\n4. ~13 x 1.5~ cm., to contain inspissated blood-serum.\r\n\r\nThe tubes should be made from the best German potash glass,\r\n\"blue-lined,\" stout and heavy, with the edge of the mouth of the tube\r\n_slightly_ turned over, but not to such an extent as to form a definite\r\nrim. (Cost about $1.50, or 6 shillings per gross.) Such tubes are\r\nexpensive it is true, but they are sufficiently stout to resist rough\r\nhandling, do not usually break if accidentally allowed to drop (a point\r\nof some moment when dealing with cultures of pathogenic bacteria), can\r\nbe cleaned, sterilised, and used over and over again, and by their\r\nlength of life fully justify their initial expense.\r\n\r\nA point be noted is that the manufacturers rarely turn out such tubes as\r\nthese absolutely uniform in calibre, and a batch of 18 by 1.5 cm. tubes\r\nusually contains such extreme sizes as 18 by 2 cm. and 18 by 1.3 cm.\r\nConsequently, if a set of standard tubes is kept for comparison or\r\ncallipers are used each new supply of so-called 18 by 1.5 cm. tubes may\r\nbe easily sorted out into these three sizes, and so simplify ordering.\r\n\r\n5. ~5 x 0.7~ cm., for use in the inverted position inside the tubes\r\ncontaining carbohydrate media, as gas-collecting tubes.\r\n\r\nThese tubes, \"unrimmed,\" may be of common thin glass as less than two\r\nper cent. are fit for use a second time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Bohemian flask.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--Pear-shaped flask.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--Erlenmeyer flask (narrow neck).]\r\n\r\n~Bohemian Flasks~ (Fig. 1).--These are the ordinary flasks of the chemical\r\nlaboratory. A good variety, ranging in capacity from 250 to 3000 c.c.,\r\nshould be kept on hand. A modified form, known as the \"pear-shaped\"\r\n(Fig. 2), is preferable for the smaller sizes--i. e., 250 and 500 c.c.\r\n\r\n~Erlenmeyer's Flasks~ (Fig. 3).--Erlenmeyer's flasks of 75, 100, and 250\r\nc.c. capacity are extremely useful. For use as culture flasks care\r\nshould be taken to select only such as have a narrow neck of about 2 cm.\r\nin length.\r\n\r\n~Kolle's Culture Flasks~ (Fig. 4).--These thin, flat flasks (to contain\r\nagar or gelatine, which is allowed to solidify in a layer on one side)\r\nare extremely useful on account of the large nutrient surface available\r\nfor growth. A surface cultivation in one of these will yield as much\r\ngrowth as ten or twelve \"oblique\" tube cultures. The wide mouth,\r\nhowever, is a disadvantage, and for many purposes thin, flat culture\r\nbottles known as ~Roux's bottles~ (Fig. 5) are to be preferred.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--Kolle's culture flask.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--Roux's culture bottle.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--Guy's culture bottle.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--Filter flask.]\r\n\r\nAn even more convenient pattern is that used in the author's laboratory\r\n(Fig. 6), as owing to the greater depth of medium which it is possible\r\nto obtain in these flasks an exceedingly luxuriant growth is possible;\r\nthe narrow neck reduces the chance of accidental contamination to a\r\nminimum and the general shape permits the flasks to be stacked one upon\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\n~Filter Flasks or Kitasato's Serum Flasks~ (Fig. 7).--Various sizes, from\r\n250 to 2000 c.c. capacity. These must be of stout glass, to resist the\r\npressure to which they are subjected, but at the same time must be\r\nthoroughly well annealed, in order to withstand the temperature\r\nnecessary for sterilisation.\r\n\r\nAll flasks should be either of Jena glass or the almost equally\r\nwell-known Resistance or R glass, the extra initial expense being\r\njustified by the comparative immunity of the glass from breakage.\r\n\r\n~Petri's Dishes or \"Plates\"~ (Fig. 8, a).--These have now completely\r\nreplaced the rectangular sheets of glass introduced by Koch for the\r\nplate method of cultivation. Each \"plate\" consists of a pair of circular\r\ndiscs of glass with sharply upturned edges, thus forming shallow dishes,\r\none of slightly greater diameter than the other, and so, when inverted,\r\nforming a cover or cap for the smaller. Plates having an outside\r\ndiameter of 10 cm. and a height of 1.5 cm. are the most generally\r\nuseful. A batch of eighteen such plates is sterilised and stored in a\r\ncylindrical copper box (30 cm. high by 12 cm. diameter) provided with a\r\n\"pull-off\" lid. Inside each box is a copper stirrup with a circular\r\nbottom, upon which the plates rest, and by means of which each can be\r\nraised in turn to the mouth of the box (Fig. 9) for removal.\r\n\r\n~Capsules~ (Fig. 8, b and c).--These are Petri's dishes of smaller\r\ndiameter but greater depth than those termed plates. Two sizes will be\r\nfound especially useful--viz., 4 cm. diameter by 2 cm. high, capacity\r\nabout 14 c.c.; and 5 cm. diameter by 2 cm. high, capacity about 25 c.c.\r\nThese are stored in copper cylinders of similar construction to those\r\nused for plates, but measuring 20 by 6 cm. and 20 by 7 cm.,\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--Petri dish (a), and capsules (b, c).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--Plate box with stirrup.]\r\n\r\n~Graduated Pipettes.~--Several varieties of these are required, viz.:\r\n\r\n1. Pipettes of 1 c.c. capacity graduated in 0.1 c.c.\r\n\r\n2. Pipettes of 1 c.c. capacity graduated in 0.01 c.c. (Fig. 10, a).\r\n\r\n3. Pipettes of 10 c.c. capacity graduated in 0.1 c.c. (Fig. 10, b).\r\n\r\nThese should be about 30 cm. in length (1 and 2 of fairly narrow bore),\r\ngraduated to the extreme point, and having at least a 10 cm. length of\r\nclear space between the first graduation and the upper end; the open\r\nmouth should be plugged with cotton-wool. Each variety should be\r\nsterilised and stored in a separate cylindrical copper case some 36 by 6\r\ncm., with \"pull-off\" lid, upon which is stamped, in plain figures, the\r\ncapacity of the contained pipettes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--Measuring pipettes, a and b.]\r\n\r\nThe laboratory should also be provided with a complete set of \"Standard\"\r\ngraduated pipettes, each pipette in the set being stamped and\r\nauthenticated by a certificate from one of the recognised Physical\r\nMeasurement Laboratories, such as Charlottenburg. These instruments are\r\nexpensive and should be reserved solely for standardising the pipettes\r\nin ordinary use, and for calibrating small pipettes manufactured in the\r\nlaboratory. Such a set should comprise, at least, pipettes delivering 10\r\nc.c., 5 c.c., 2.5 c.c., 2 c.c., 1 c.c., 0.5 c.c., 0.25 c.c., 0.2 c.c.,\r\n0.1 c.c., 0.05 c.c., and 0.01 c.c., respectively.\r\n\r\nIn the immediately following sections are described small pieces of\r\nglass apparatus which should be prepared in the laboratory from glass\r\ntubing of various sizes. In their preparation three articles are\r\nessential; first a three-square hard-steel file or preferably a\r\nglass-worker's knife of hard Thuringian steel for cutting glass tubes\r\netc.; next a blowpipe flame, for although much can be done with the\r\nordinary Bunsen burner, a blowpipe flame makes for rapid work; and\r\nlastly a bat's-wing burner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--Glass-cutting knife. a. handle. b. double\r\nedged blade. c. shaft. d. locking nut. e. spanner for nut.]\r\n\r\n1. The glass-cutting knife. This article is sold in two forms, a bench\r\nknife (Fig. 11) and a pocket knife. The former is provided with a blade\r\nsome 8 cm. in length and having two cutting edges. The cutting edge when\r\nexamined in a strong light is seen to be composed of small closely set\r\nteeth, similar to those in a saw. The knife should be kept sharp by\r\nfrequent stroppings on a sandstone hone. The pocket form, about 6-cm.\r\nlong over all, consists of a small spring blade with one cutting edge\r\nmounted in scales like an ordinary pocket knife.\r\n\r\n2. For real convenience of work the blowpipe should be mounted on a\r\nspecial table connected up with cylindrical bellows operated by a pedal.\r\nThat figured (Fig. 12) is made by mounting a teak top 60 cm. square upon\r\nthe uprights of an enclosed double-action concertina bellows (Enfer's)\r\nand provided with a Fletcher's Universal gas blowpipe.\r\n\r\n3. An ordinary bat's-wing gas-burner mounted at the far corner of the\r\ntable top is invaluable in the preparation of tubular apparatus with\r\nsharp curves, and for coating newly-made glass apparatus with a layer of\r\nsoot to prevent too rapid cooling, and its usually associated\r\nresult--cracking.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--Glass blower's table with Enfer's foot\r\nbellows.]\r\n\r\n6. ~Sedimentation tubes 5x0.5~ cm., for sedimentation reactions, etc., and\r\nfor containing small quantities of fluid to be centrifugalised in the\r\nhaematocrit. These are made by taking 14-cm. lengths of stout glass\r\ntubing of the requisite diameter and heating the centre in the Bunsen or\r\nblowpipe flame. When the central portion is quite soft draw the ends\r\nquickly apart and then round off the pointed ends of the two test-tubes\r\nthus formed. With the glass-cutting knife cut off whatever may be\r\nnecessary from the open ends to make the tubes the required length.\r\n\r\nA rectangular block of \"plasticine\" (modelling clay) into which the\r\nconical ends can be thrust makes a very convenient stand for these small\r\ntubes.\r\n\r\n~Capillary Pipettes or Pasteur's Pipettes~ (Fig. 13 a).--These little\r\ninstruments are invaluable, and a goodly supply should be kept on hand.\r\nThey are prepared from soft-glass tubing of various-sized calibre (the\r\nmost generally useful size being 8 mm. diameter) in the following\r\nmanner: Hold a 10 cm. length of glass tube by each end, and whilst\r\nrotating it heat the central portion in the Bunsen flame or the blowpipe\r\nblast-flame until the glass is red hot and soft. Now remove it from the\r\nflame and steadily pull the ends apart, so drawing the heated portion\r\nout into a roomy capillary tube; break the capillary portion at its\r\ncentre, seal the broken ends in the flame, and round off the edges of\r\nthe open end of each pipette. A loose plug of cotton-wool in the open\r\nmouth completes the capillary pipette. After a number have been\r\nprepared, they are sterilised and stored in batches, either in metal\r\ncases similar to those used for the graduated pipettes or in large-sized\r\ntest-tubes--sealed ends downward and plugged ends toward the mouth of\r\nthe case.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--Capillary pipettes. a, b, c.]\r\n\r\nThe filling and emptying of the capillary pipette is most satisfactorily\r\naccomplished by slipping a small rubber teat (similar to that on a\r\nbaby's feeding bottle but _not perforated_) on the upper end, after\r\ncutting or snapping off the sealed point of the capillary portion. If\r\npressure is now exerted upon the elastic bulb by a finger and thumb\r\nwhilst the capillary end is below the surface of the fluid to be taken\r\nup, some of the contained air will be driven out, and subsequent\r\nrelaxation of that pressure (resulting in the formation of a partial\r\nvacuum) will cause the fluid to ascend the capillary tube. Subsequent\r\ncompression of the bulb will naturally result in the complete expulsion\r\nof the fluid from the pipette (Fig. 14).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--Filling the capillary teat-pipette.]\r\n\r\nA modification of this pipette, in which a constriction or short length\r\nof capillary tube is introduced just below the plugged mouth (Fig. 13,\r\nb), will also be found extremely useful in the collection and storage\r\nof morbid exudations.\r\n\r\nA third form, where the capillary portion is about 4 or 5 cm. long and\r\nonly forms a small fraction of the entire length of the pipette (Fig.\r\n13, c), will also be found useful.\r\n\r\n~\"Blood\" Pipettes~ (Fig 15).--Special pipettes for the collection of\r\nfairly large quantities of blood (as suggested by Pakes) should also be\r\nprepared. These are made from _soft_ glass tubing of 1 cm. bore, in a\r\nsimilar manner to the Pasteur pipettes, except that the point of the\r\nblowpipe flame must be used in order to obtain the sharp shoulder at\r\neither end of the central bulb. The terminal tubes must retain a\r\ndiameter of at least 1 mm., in order to avoid capillary action during\r\nthe collection of the fluid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--Blood pipettes and hair-lip pin in a\r\ntest-tube.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--Blood-pipette in metal thermometer case.]\r\n\r\nFor sterilisation and storage each pipette is placed inside a test-tube,\r\nresting on a wad of cotton-wool, and the tube plugged in the ordinary\r\nmanner. As these tubes are used almost exclusively for blood work, it is\r\nusual to place a lance-headed hare-lip pin or a No. 9 flat Hagedorn\r\nneedle inside the tube so that the entire outfit may be sterilised at\r\none time.\r\n\r\nFor the collection of small quantities of blood for agglutination\r\nreactions and the like, many prefer a short straight piece of narrow\r\nglass tubing drawn out at either extremity to almost capillary\r\ndimensions. Such pipettes, about 8 cm. in length over all, are most\r\nconveniently sterilized in ordinary metal thermometer cases (Fig. 16).\r\n\r\n~Graduated Capillary Pipettes~ (Fig. 17).--These should also be made in\r\nthe laboratory--from manometer tubing--of simple, convenient shape, and\r\ngraduated by the aid of \"standard\" pipettes (in hundredths) to contain\r\nsuch quantities as 10, 50, and 90 c. mm., and carefully marked with a\r\nwriting diamond. These, previously sterilised in large test-tubes, will\r\nbe found extremely useful in preparing accurate percentage solutions,\r\nwhen only minute quantities of fluid are available.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--Capillary graduated pipettes.]\r\n\r\n~Automatic (\"Throttle\") Pipettes.~--These ingenious pipettes, introduced\r\nby Wright, can easily be calibrated in the laboratory and are\r\nexceedingly useful for graduating small pipettes, for measuring small\r\nquantities of fluids, in preparing dilutions of serum for agglutination\r\nreactions, etc. They are usually made from the Capillary Pasteur\r\npipettes (Fig. 13, a). The following description of the manufacture of\r\na 5 c. mm. pipette will serve to show how the small automatic pipettes\r\nare calibrated.\r\n\r\n1. Select a pipette the capillary portion of which is fairly roomy in\r\nbore and possesses regular even walls, and remove the cotton-wool plug\r\nfrom the open end.\r\n\r\n2. Heat the capillary portion near the free extremity in the by-pass\r\nflame of the bunsen burner and draw it out into a very fine hair-like\r\ntube and break this across. This hair-like extremity will permit the\r\npassage of air but is too fine for metallic mercury to pass.\r\n\r\n3. From a standard graduated pipette deliver 5 c. mm. clean mercury into\r\nthe upper wide portion of the pipette.\r\n\r\n4. Adjust a rubber teat to the pipette and by pressure on the bulb\r\ngradually drive the mercury in an unbroken column down the capillary\r\ntube until it is stopped by the filiform extremity.\r\n\r\n5. Cut off the capillary tube exactly at the upper level of the column\r\nof mercury, invert it and allow the mercury to run out.\r\n\r\n6. Snap off the remainder of the capillary tube from the broad upper\r\nportion of the pipette which is now destined to form the covering tube\r\nor air chamber, or what we may term the \"barrel.\" This barrel now has\r\nthe lower end in the form of a truncated cone, the upper end being cut\r\nsquare. Remove the teat.\r\n\r\n7. Introduce the capillary tube into this barrel with the filiform\r\nextremity uppermost, and the square cut end projecting about 0.5 cm.\r\nbeyond the tapering end of the barrel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--Throttle pipette--small capacity.]\r\n\r\n8. Drop a small pellet of sealing wax into the barrel by the side of the\r\ncapillary tube and then warm the tube at the gas flame until the wax\r\nbecomes softened and makes an air-tight joint between the capillary tube\r\nand the end of the barrel.\r\n\r\n9. Fit a rubber teat to the open end of the barrel, and so complete a\r\npipette which can be depended upon to always aspirate and deliver\r\nexactly 5 cm. of fluid.\r\n\r\nSlight modification of this procedure is necessary in making tubes to\r\nmeasure larger volumes than say 75 c. mm. Thus to make a throttle\r\npipette to measure 100 c. mm.:\r\n\r\n1. Take a short length of quill tubing and draw out one end into a roomy\r\ncapillary stem, and again draw out the extremity into a fine hair point,\r\nthus forming a small Pasteur pipette with a hair-like capillary\r\nextremity.\r\n\r\n2. With a standard pipette fill 100 c. mm. into the neck of this\r\npipette, and make a scratch with a writing diamond at the upper level\r\n(a) of the mercury meniscus (Fig. 19, A).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--Making throttle pipettes--large capacity]\r\n\r\nNow force the mercury down into the capillary stem as far as it will go,\r\nso as to leave the upper part of the tube in the region of the diamond\r\nscratch empty (Fig. 19, B).\r\n\r\n3. Heat the tube in the region of the diamond scratch in the blowpipe\r\nflame, and removing the tube from the flame draw it out so that the\r\ndiamond scratch now occupies a position somewhere near the centre of\r\nthis new capillary portion (Fig. 19, C).\r\n\r\n4. Heat the tube in this position in the peep flame of the Bunsen\r\nburner, and draw it out into a hair-like extremity. Snap off the glass\r\ntube, leaving about 5 mm. of hair-like extremity attached to the upper\r\ncapillary portion (Fig. 19, D). Allow the glass to cool.\r\n\r\n5. Lift up the bulb by the long capillary stem and allow the mercury to\r\nreturn to its original position--an operation which will be facilitated\r\nby snapping off the hair-like extremity from the long piece of capillary\r\ntubing.\r\n\r\n6. Mark on the capillary stem with a grease pencil the position of the\r\nend of the column of mercury (Fig. 19, E.)\r\n\r\n7. Warm the capillary tubing at this spot in the peep flame of the\r\nBunsen burner, and draw it out very slightly so that when cut at this\r\nposition a pointed extremity will be obtained.\r\n\r\n8. With a glass-cutting knife cut the capillary tube through at the\r\npoint \"b,\" and allow the mercury to run out.\r\n\r\n9. Now apply a thick layer of sealing wax to the neck of the bulb.\r\n\r\n10. Take a piece of 5 mm. bore glass tubing and draw it out as if making\r\nan ordinary Pasteur pipette.\r\n\r\n11. Break the capillary portion off so as to leave a covering tube\r\nsimilar to that already used for the smaller graduated pipettes. Into\r\nthis covering tube drop the graduated bulb and draw the capillary stem\r\ndown through the conical extremity until further progress is stopped by\r\nthe layer of sealing wax.\r\n\r\n12. Warm the pipette in the gas flame so as to melt the sealing wax and\r\nmake an air-tight joint.\r\n\r\n13. Fit an india-rubber teat over the open end of the covering tube, and\r\nthe automatic pipette is ready for use (Fig. 19, F).\r\n\r\n~Sedimentation Pipettes~ (Fig. 20).--These are prepared from 10 cm.\r\nlengths of narrow glass tubing by sealing one extremity, blowing a\r\nsmall bulb at the centre, and plugging the open end with cotton-wool;\r\nafter sterilisation the open end is provided with a short piece of\r\nrubber tubing and a glass mouthpiece. When it is necessary to observe\r\nsedimentation reactions in very small quantities of fluid, these tubes\r\nwill be found much more convenient than the 5 by 0.5 cm. test-tubes\r\npreviously mentioned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--Sedimentation pipette.]\r\n\r\nPasteur pipettes fitted with india-rubber teats will also be found\r\nuseful for sedimentation tests when dealing with minute quantities of\r\nserum, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.--Fermentation tubes.]\r\n\r\n~Fermentation Tubes~ (Fig. 21).--These are used for the collection and\r\nanalysis of the gases liberated from the media during the growth of some\r\nvarieties of bacteria and may be either plain (a) or graduated (b).\r\nA simple form (Fig. 21, c) may be made from 14 cm. lengths of soft\r\nglass tubing of 1.5 cm. diameter. The Bunsen flame is applied to a spot\r\nsome 5 cm. from one end of such a piece of tubing and the tube slightly\r\ndrawn out to form a constriction, the constricted part is bent in the\r\nbat's-wing flame, to an acute angle, and the open extremity of the long\r\narm sealed off in the blowpipe flame. The open end of the short arm is\r\nrounded off and then plugged with cotton-wool, and the tube is ready for\r\nsterilisation.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLEANING OF GLASS APPARATUS.\r\n\r\nAll glassware used in the bacteriological laboratory must be thoroughly\r\ncleaned before use, and this rule applies as forcibly to new as to old\r\napparatus, although the methods employed may vary slightly.\r\n\r\n~To Clean New Test-tubes.~--\r\n\r\n1. Place the tubes in a bucket or other convenient receptacle, fill with\r\nwater and add a handful of \"Sapon\" or other soap powder. See that the\r\ntubes are full and submerged.\r\n\r\n2. Fix the bucket over a large Bunsen flame and boil for thirty\r\nminutes--or boil in the autoclave for a similar period.\r\n\r\n3. Cleanse the interior of the tubes with the aid of test-tube brushes,\r\nand rinse thoroughly in cold water.\r\n\r\n4. Invert the tubes and allow them to drain completely.\r\n\r\n5. Dry the tubes and polish the glass inside and out with a soft cloth,\r\nsuch as selvyt.\r\n\r\n~New flasks, plates, and capsules~ must be cleaned in a similar manner.\r\n\r\n~To Clean New Graduated Pipettes.~--\r\n\r\n1. Place the pipettes in a convenient receptacle, filled with water to\r\nwhich soap powder has been added.\r\n\r\n2. Boil the water vigorously for twenty minutes over a Bunsen flame.\r\n\r\n3. Rinse the pipettes in running water and drain.\r\n\r\n4. Run distilled water through the pipettes and drain.\r\n\r\n5. Run rectified spirits through the pipette and drain as completely as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n6. Place the pipettes in the hot-air oven (_vide_ page 31), close the\r\ndoor, open the ventilating slide, and run the temperature slowly up to\r\nabout 80 deg. C. Turn off the gas and allow the oven to cool.\r\n\r\nOr 6a. Attach each pipette in turn to the rubber tube of the foot\r\nbellows, or blowpipe air-blast, and blow air through the pipette until\r\nthe interior is dry.\r\n\r\nGlassware that has already been used is regarded as _infected_, and is\r\ntreated in a slightly different manner.\r\n\r\n~Infected Test-tubes.~--\r\n\r\n1. Pack the tubes in the wire basket of the autoclave (having previously\r\nremoved the cotton-wool plugs, caps, etc.), in the vertical position,\r\nand before replacing the basket see that there is a sufficiency of water\r\nin the bottom of the boiler. Now attach a piece of rubber tubing to the\r\nnearest water tap, and by means of this fill each tube with water.\r\n\r\n2. Disinfect completely by exposing the tubes, etc., to a temperature of\r\n120 deg. C. for twenty minutes (_vide_ page 37).\r\n\r\n(If an autoclave is not available, the tubes must be placed in a\r\ndigester, or even a large pan or pail with a tightly fitting cover, and\r\nboiled vigorously for some thirty to forty-five minutes to ensure\r\ndisinfection.)\r\n\r\n3. Whilst still hot, empty each tube in turn and roughly clean its\r\ninterior with a stiff test-tube brush.\r\n\r\n4. Place the tubes in a bucket or other convenient receptacle, fill with\r\nwater and add a handful of Sapon or other soap powder. See that the\r\ntubes are full and submerged.\r\n\r\n5. Fix the bucket over a large Bunsen flame and boil for thirty minutes.\r\n\r\n6. Cleanse the interior of the tubes with the aid of test-tube brushes,\r\nand rinse thoroughly in cold water.\r\n\r\n7. Drain off the water and immerse tubes in a large jar containing water\r\nacidulated with 2 to 5 per cent. hydrochloric acid. Allow them to remain\r\nthere for about fifteen minutes.\r\n\r\n8. Remove from the acid jar, drain, rinse thoroughly in running water,\r\nthen with distilled water.\r\n\r\n9. Invert the tubes and allow them to drain completely.\r\n\r\nDry the tubes and polish the glass inside and out with a soft cloth,\r\nsuch as selvyt.\r\n\r\n~Infected flasks, plates, and capsules~ must be treated in a similar\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n~Flasks~ which have been used only in the preparation of media must be\r\ncleaned immediately they are finished with. Fill each flask with water\r\nto which some soap powder and a few crystals of potassium permanganate\r\nhave been added, and let boil over the naked flame. The interior of the\r\nflask can then usually be perfectly cleaned with the aid of a flask\r\nbrush, but in some cases water acidulated with 5 per cent. nitric acid,\r\nor a large wad of wet cotton-wool previously rolled in silver sand, must\r\nbe shaken around the interior of the flask, after which rinse thoroughly\r\nwith clean water, dry, and polish.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Infected Pipettes.~--\r\n\r\n1. Plunge infected pipettes immediately after use into tall glass\r\ncylinders containing a 2 per cent. solution of lysol, and allow them to\r\nremain therein for some days.\r\n\r\n2. Remove from the jar and drain. Boil in water to which a little soap\r\nhas been added, for thirty minutes.\r\n\r\n3. Rinse thoroughly in cold water.\r\n\r\n4. Immerse in 5 per cent. nitric acid for an hour or two.\r\n\r\n5. Rinse again in running water to remove all traces of acid.\r\n\r\n6. Complete the cleaning as described under \"new pipettes.\"\r\n\r\nWhen dealing with graduated capillary pipettes employed for blood or\r\nserum work (whether new or infected), much time is consumed in the\r\nvarious steps from 5 onward, and the cleansing process can be materially\r\nhastened if the following device is adopted.\r\n\r\nFit up a large-sized Kitasato's filter flask to a Sprengel's suction\r\npump or a Geryk air pump (see page 43). To the side tubulure of the\r\nfilter flask attach a 20 cm. length of rubber pressure tubing having a\r\ncalibre sufficiently large to admit the ends of the pipettes.\r\n\r\nNext fill a small beaker with distilled water. Attach the first pipette\r\nto the free end of the rubber tubing, place the pipette point downward\r\nin the beaker of water and start the pump (Fig. 22).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.--Cleaning blood pipettes.]\r\n\r\nWhen all the water has been aspirated through the pipette into the\r\nfilter flask, fill the beaker with rectified spirit and when this is\r\nexhausted refill with ether. Detach the pipette and dry in the hot-air\r\noven.\r\n\r\n~Slides and cover-slips~ (Fig. 23), when first purchased, have \"greasy\"\r\nsurfaces, upon which water gathers in minute drops and effectually\r\nprevents the spreading of thin, even films.\r\n\r\n~Microscopical Slides.~--The slides in general use are those known as\r\n\"three by one\" slips (measuring 3 inches by 1 inch, or 76 by 26 mm.),\r\nand should be of good white crown glass, with ground edges.\r\n\r\n~New slides~ should be allowed to remain in alcohol acidulated with 5 per\r\ncent. hydrochloric acid for some hours, rinsed in running water, roughly\r\ndrained on a towel, dried, and finally polished with a selvyt cloth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.--Slides and cover-slips, actual size.]\r\n\r\nIf only a few slides are required for immediate use a good plan is to\r\nrub the surface with jeweler's emery paper (Hubert's 00). A piece of\r\nhard wood 76x26x26 mm. with a piece of this emery paper gummed tightly\r\naround it is an exceedingly useful article on the microscope bench.\r\n\r\n~Cover-slips.~--The most useful sizes are the 19 mm. squares for ordinary\r\ncover-glass film preparations, and 38 by 19 mm. rectangles for blood\r\nfilms and serial sections; both varieties must be of \"No. 1\" thickness,\r\nwhich varies between 0.15 and 0.22 mm., that they may be available for\r\nuse with the high-power immersion lenses.\r\n\r\nCover-slips should be cleaned in the following manner:\r\n\r\n1. Drop the cover-slips one by one into an enamelled iron pot or tall\r\nglass beaker, containing a 10 per cent. solution of chromic acid.\r\n\r\n2. Heat over a Bunsen flame and allow the acid to boil gently for twenty\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--A few pieces of pipe-clay or pumice may be placed in\r\n     the beaker to prevent the \"spurting\" of the chromic acid.\r\n\r\n3. Turn the cover-slips out into a flat glass dish and wash in running\r\nwater under the tap until all trace of yellow colour has disappeared.\r\nDuring the washing keep the cover-slips in motion by imparting a\r\nrotatory movement to the dish.\r\n\r\n4. Wash in distilled water in a similar manner.\r\n\r\n5. Wash in rectified spirit.\r\n\r\n6. Transfer the cover-slips, by means of a pair of clean forceps,\r\npreviously heated in the Bunsen flame to destroy any trace of grease, to\r\na small beaker of absolute alcohol.\r\n\r\nDrain off the alcohol and transfer the cover-slips, by means of the\r\nforceps, to a wide-mouthed glass pot, containing absolute alcohol, in\r\nwhich they are to be stored, and stopper tightly.\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--After once being placed in the chromic acid, the\r\n     cover-slips must on no account be touched by the fingers.\r\n\r\n~Used Slides and Cover-slips.~--Used slides with the mounted cover-slip\r\npreparations, and cover-slips used for hanging-drop mounts, should, when\r\ndiscarded, be thrown into a pot containing a 2 per cent. solution of\r\nlysol.\r\n\r\nAfter immersion therein for a week or so, even the cover-slips mounted\r\nwith Canada balsam can be readily detached from their slides.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Slides._--\r\n\r\n1. Wash the slides thoroughly in running water.\r\n\r\n2. Boil the slides in water to which \"sapon\" has been added, for half an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\n3. Rinse thoroughly in cold water.\r\n\r\n4. Dry and polish with a dry cloth.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cover-slips._--\r\n\r\n1. Wash the cover-slips thoroughly in running water.\r\n\r\n2. Boil the cover-slips in 10 per cent. solution of chromic acid, as for\r\nnew cover-slips.\r\n\r\n3. Wash thoroughly in running water.\r\n\r\n4. Pick out those cover-slips which show much adherent dirty matter, and\r\nrub them between thumb and forefinger under the water tap. The dirt\r\nusually rubs off easily, as it has become friable from contact with the\r\nchromic acid.\r\n\r\n5. Return all the cover-slips to the beaker, fill in _fresh_ chromic\r\nacid solution, and treat as new cover-slips.\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--_Test-tubes, plates, capsules_, etc., which, from\r\n     long use, have become scratched and hazy, or which cannot be\r\n     cleaned in any other way, may be dealt with by immersing\r\n     them in an enamelled iron bath, containing water acidulated\r\n     to 1 per cent. with hydrofluoric acid, for ten minutes,\r\n     rinsing thoroughly in water, drying, and polishing.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLUGGING TEST-TUBES AND FLASKS.\r\n\r\nBefore sterilisation all test-tubes and flasks must be carefully plugged\r\nwith cotton-wool, and for this purpose best absorbent cotton-wool\r\n(preferably that put up in cylindrical one-pound packets and interleaved\r\nwith tissue paper--known as surgeons' wool) should be employed.\r\n\r\n1. For a test-tube or a small flask, tear a strip of cotton-wool some 10\r\ncm. long by 2 cm. wide from the roll.\r\n\r\n2. Turn in the ends neatly and roll the strip of wool lightly between\r\nthe thumb and fingers of both hands to form a long cylinder.\r\n\r\n3. Double this at the centre and introduce the now rounded end into the\r\nopen mouth of the tube or flask.\r\n\r\n4. Now, whilst supporting the wool between the thumb and fingers of the\r\nright hand, rotate the test-tube between those of the left, and\r\ngradually screw the plug of wool into its mouth for a distance of about\r\n2.5 cm., leaving about the same length of wool projecting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG 24..--Plugging test-tubes: a, cylinder of wool\r\nbeing rolled; b, cylinder of wool being doubled; c, cylinder of wool\r\nbeing inserted in tube.]\r\n\r\nThe plug must be firm and fit the tube or flask fairly tightly,\r\nsufficiently tightly in fact to bear the weight of the glass plus the\r\namount of medium the vessel is intended to contain, but not so tightly\r\nas to prevent it from being easily removed by a screwing motion when\r\ngrasped between the fourth, or third and fourth, fingers, and the palm\r\nof the hand.\r\n\r\nFor a large flask a similar but larger strip of wool must be taken; the\r\nmethod of making and inserting the plug is identical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. METHODS OF STERILISATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTERILISING AGENTS.\r\n\r\nSterilisation--i. e., the removal or the destruction of germ life--may\r\nbe effected by the use of various agents. As applied to the practical\r\nrequirements of the bacteriological laboratory, many of these agents,\r\nsuch as electricity, sunlight, etc., are of little value, others are\r\nlimited in their applications; others again are so well suited to\r\nparticular purposes that their use is almost entirely restricted to\r\nsuch.\r\n\r\nThe sterilising agents in common use are:\r\n\r\n~Chemical Reagents.~--_Disinfectants_ (for the disinfection of glass and\r\nmetal apparatus and of morbid tissues).\r\n\r\n~Physical Agents.~ HEAT.--(a) _Dry Heat:_\r\n\r\n1. Naked flame (for the sterilisation of platinum needles, etc.).\r\n\r\n2. Muffle furnace (for the sterilisation of filter candles, and for the\r\ndestruction of morbid tissues).\r\n\r\n3. Hot air (for the sterilisation of all glassware and of metal\r\napparatus).\r\n\r\n(b) _Moist Heat:_\r\n\r\n1. Water at 56 deg. C. (for the sterilisation of certain albuminous\r\nfluids).\r\n\r\n2. Water at 100 deg. C. (for the sterilisation of surgical instruments,\r\nrubber tubing, and stoppers, etc.).\r\n\r\n3. Streaming steam at 100 deg. C. (for the sterilisation of media).\r\n\r\n4. Superheated steam at 115 deg. C. or 120 deg. C. (for the disinfection\r\nof contaminated articles and the destruction of old cultivations of\r\nbacteria).\r\n\r\nFILTRATION.--\r\n\r\n1. Cotton-wool filters (for the sterilisation of air and gases).\r\n\r\n2. Porcelain filters (for the sterilisation of various liquids).\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF APPLICATION.\r\n\r\n~Chemical Reagents~, such as belong to the class known as antiseptics (_i.\r\ne._, substances which inhibit the growth of, but do not destroy,\r\nbacterial life), are obviously useless. Disinfectants or germicides (_i.\r\ne._, substances which destroy bacterial life), on the other hand, are of\r\nvalue in the disinfection of morbid material, and also of various pieces\r\nof apparatus, such as pipettes, pending their cleansing and complete\r\nsterilisation by other processes. To this class (in order of general\r\nutility) belong:\r\n\r\n    Lysol, 2 per cent. solution;\r\n    Perchloride of mercury, 0.1 per cent. solution;\r\n    Carbolic acid, 5 per cent. solution;\r\n    Absolute alcohol;\r\n    Ether;\r\n    Chloroform;\r\n    Camphor;\r\n    Thymol;\r\n    Toluol;\r\n    Volatile oils, such as oil of mustard, oil of garlic.\r\n\r\nFormaldehyde is a powerful germicide, but its penetrating vapor\r\nrestricts its use. These disinfectants are but little used in the final\r\nsterilisation of apparatus, chiefly on account of the difficulty of\r\neffecting their complete removal, for the presence of even traces of\r\nthese chemicals is sufficient to so inhibit or alter the growth of\r\nbacteria as to vitiate subsequent experiments conducted by the aid of\r\napparatus sterilised in this manner.\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--Tubes, flasks, filter flasks, pipettes, glass tubing,\r\n     etc., may be rapidly sterilised, in case of emergency, by\r\n     washing, in turn, with distilled water, perchloride of\r\n     mercury solution, alcohol, and ether, draining, and finally\r\n     gently heating over a gas flame to completely drive off the\r\n     ether vapor. Chloroform or other volatile disinfectants may\r\n     be added to various fluids in order to effect the\r\n     destruction of contained bacteria, and when this has been\r\n     done, may be completely driven off from the fluid by the\r\n     application of gentle heat.\r\n\r\n~Dry Heat.~--The _naked flame_ of the Bunsen burner is invariably used for\r\nsterilising the platinum needles (which are heated to redness) and may\r\nbe employed for sterilising the points of forceps, or other small\r\ninstruments, cover-glasses, pipettes, etc., a very short exposure to\r\nthis heat being sufficient.\r\n\r\n_Ether Flame._--In an emergency small instruments, needles, etc., may be\r\nsterilised by dipping them in ether and after removal lighting the\r\nadherent fluid and allowing it to burn off the surface of the\r\ninstruments. Repeat the process twice. It may then be safely assumed\r\nthat the apparatus so treated is sterile.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.--Muffle furnace.]\r\n\r\n_Muffle Furnace_ (Fig. 25).--Although this form of heat is chiefly used\r\nfor the destruction of the dead bodies of small infected animals, morbid\r\ntissues, etc., it is also employed for the sterilisation of porcelain\r\nfilter candles (_vide_ p. 42).\r\n\r\nFilter candles are disinfected immediately after use by boiling in a\r\nbeaker of water for some fifteen or twenty minutes. This treatment,\r\nhowever, leaves the dead bodies of the bacteria upon the surface and\r\nblocking the interstices of the filter.\r\n\r\nTo destroy the organic matter and prepare the filter candle for further\r\nuse proceed as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Roll each bougie up in a piece of asbestos cloth, secure the ends of\r\nthe cloth with a few turns of copper wire, and place inside the muffle\r\n(a small muffle 76x88x163 mm. will hold perhaps four small filter\r\ncandles).\r\n\r\n2. Light the gas and raise the contents of the muffle to a white heat;\r\nmaintain this temperature for five minutes.\r\n\r\n3. Extinguish the gas, and when the muffle has become quite cold remove\r\nthe filter candles, and store them (without removing the asbestos\r\nwrappings) in sterile metal boxes.\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--The too rapid cooling of the candles, such as takes\r\n     place if they are removed from the muffle before it has\r\n     cooled down to the room temperature, may give rise to\r\n     microscopic cracks and flaws which will effectually destroy\r\n     their efficiency.\r\n\r\n_Hot Air._--Hot air at 150 deg. C. destroys all bacteria, spores, etc:, in\r\nabout thirty minutes; a momentary exposure to a temperature of 175 deg. to\r\n180 deg. C. will effect the same result and offers the more convenient\r\nmethod of sterilisation. This method is only applicable to glass and\r\nmetallic substances, and the small bulk of cotton-wool comprised in the\r\ntest-tube plugs, etc. Large masses of fabric are not effectually\r\nsterilised by dry heat--short of charring--as its power of penetration\r\nis not great.\r\n\r\nSterilisation by hot air is effected in the hot-air oven (Fig. 18). This\r\nis a rectangular, double-walled metal box, mounted on a stand and heated\r\nfrom below by a large Bunsen burner. The interior of the oven is\r\nprovided with loose shelves upon which the articles to be sterilised are\r\narranged, either singly or packed in square wire baskets or crates, kept\r\nspecially for this purpose. One of the sides is hinged to form a door.\r\nThe central portion of the metal bottom, on which the Bunsen flame would\r\nplay, is cut away, and replaced by firebrick plates, which slide in\r\nmetal grooves and are easily replaced when broken or worn out. The top\r\nof the oven is provided with a perforated ventilator slide and two\r\ntubulures, the one for the reception of a centigrade thermometer\r\ngraduated to 200 deg. or 250 deg. C., the other for a thermo-regulator. An\r\nordinary mercurial thermo-regulator may be used but it is preferable to\r\nemploy a regulating capsule of the Hearson type (see p. 219) with a\r\nspring arm adjusted to the lever so that when the boiling-point of the\r\ncapsule (e. g., 175 deg. C.) is reached the gas supply is absolutely cut\r\noff and the jet cannot again be lighted until the spring-arm has been\r\nreadjusted by hand. The thermo-regulator is by no means a necessity, and\r\nmay be replaced by a large bore thermometer with a sliding platinum\r\npoint, connected with an electric bell, which can be easily adjusted to\r\nring at any given temperature. Even if the steriliser is provided with\r\nthe capsule regulator above described the contact thermometer should\r\nalso be fitted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.--Hot-air oven.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTO USE THE HOT-AIR OVEN.--\r\n\r\n1. Place the crates of test-tubes, metal cases containing plates and\r\npipettes, loose apparatus, etc., inside the oven, taking particular care\r\nthat none of the cotton-wool plugs are in contact with the walls,\r\notherwise the heat transmitted by the metal will char or even flame\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n     To prepare a wire crate for the reception of test-tubes,\r\n     etc., cover the bottom with a layer of thick asbestos cloth;\r\n     or take some asbestos fibre, moisten it with a little water\r\n     and knead it into a paste; plaster the paste over the bottom\r\n     of the crate, working it into the meshes and smoothing the\r\n     surface by means of a pestle. When several crates have been\r\n     thus treated, place them inside the hot-air oven, close the\r\n     door, open the ventilating slide, light the gas, and run the\r\n     temperature of the interior up to about 160 deg. C. After an\r\n     interval of ten minutes extinguish the gas, open the oven\r\n     door, and allow the contents to cool. The asbestos now forms\r\n     a smooth, dry, spongy layer over the bottom, which will last\r\n     many months before needing renewal, and will considerably\r\n     diminish the loss of tubes from breakage.\r\n\r\n     Copper cylinders and large test-tubes intended for the\r\n     reception of pipettes are prepared in a similar manner, in\r\n     order to protect the points of these articles from injury.\r\n\r\n2. Close the oven door, and open the ventilating slide, in order that\r\nany moisture left in the tubes, etc., may escape; light the gas below;\r\nset the electric alarm to ring at 100 deg. C.\r\n\r\n3. When the temperature of the oven has reached 100 deg. C., close the\r\nventilating slide; reset the alarm to ring at 175 deg. C.\r\n\r\n4. Run the temperature up to 175 deg. C.\r\n\r\n5. Extinguish the gas at once, and allow the apparatus to cool.\r\n\r\n6. When the temperature of the interior, as recorded by the thermometer,\r\nhas fallen to 60 deg. C.--_but not before_--the door may be opened and\r\nthe sterile articles removed and stored away.\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--Neglect of this precautionary cooling of the oven to\r\n     60 deg. C. will result in numerous cracked and broken tubes.\r\n\r\nOn removal from the oven, the cotton-wool plugs will probably be\r\nslightly brown in colour.\r\n\r\nMetal instruments, such as knives, scissors, and forceps, may be\r\nsterilised in the hot-air oven as described above, but exposure to 175 deg.\r\nC. is likely to seriously affect the temper of the steel and certainly\r\nblunts the cutting edges. If, however, it is desired to sterilise\r\nsurgical instruments by hot air, they should be packed in a metal box,\r\nor boxes, and heated to 130 deg. C. and retained at that temperature for\r\nabout thirty minutes.\r\n\r\n~Moist Heat.~--_Water at 56 deg. C._--This temperature, if maintained for\r\nthirty minutes, is sufficient to destroy the vegetative forms of\r\nbacteria, but has practically no effect on spores. Its use is limited to\r\nthe sterilisation of such albuminous \"fluid\" media as would coagulate at\r\na higher temperature.\r\n\r\nMETHOD.--\r\n\r\n1. Fit up a water-bath, heated by a Bunsen flame which is controlled by\r\na thermo-regulator, so that the temperature of the water remains at 56\r\ndeg. C.\r\n\r\n2. Immerse the tubes or flasks containing the albuminous fluid in the\r\nwater-bath so that the upper level of such fluid is at least 2 cm. below\r\nthe level of the water. (The temperature of the bath will now fall\r\nsomewhat, but after a few minutes will again rise to 56 deg. C).\r\n\r\n3. After thirty minutes' exposure to 56 deg. C, extinguish the gas, remove\r\nthe tubes or flasks from the bath, and subject them to the action of\r\nrunning water so that their contents are rapidly cooled.\r\n\r\n4. The vegetative forms of bacteria present in the liquid being killed,\r\nstand it for twenty-four hours in a cool, dark place; at the end of that\r\ntime some at least of such spores as may be present will have germinated\r\nand assumed the vegetative form.\r\n\r\n5. Destroy these new vegetative forms by a similar exposure to 56 deg. C.\r\non the second day, whilst others, of slower germination, may be caught on\r\nthe third day, and so on.\r\n\r\n6. In order to ensure thorough sterilisation, repeat the process on each\r\nof six successive days.\r\n\r\nThis method of exposing liquids to a temperature of 56 deg. C. in a\r\nwater-bath for half an hour on each of six successive days is termed\r\n_fractional sterilisation_.\r\n\r\n_Water at 100 deg. C._ destroys the vegetative forms of bacteria almost\r\ninstantaneously, and spores in from five to fifteen minutes. This method\r\nof sterilisation is applicable to the metal instruments, such as knives,\r\nforceps, etc., used in animal experiments; syringes, rubber corks,\r\nrubber and glass tubing, and other small apparatus, and is effected in\r\nwhat is usually spoken of as the \"water steriliser\" (Fig. 27).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.--Water sterilizer.]\r\n\r\nThis is a rectangular copper box, 26 cm. long, 18 cm. wide, and 12 cm.\r\ndeep, mounted on legs, heated from below by a Bunsen or radial gas\r\nburner, and containing a movable copper wire tray, 2 cm. smaller in\r\nevery dimension than the steriliser itself, and provided with handles.\r\nThe top of the steriliser is hinged to form a lid.\r\n\r\nMETHOD.--\r\n\r\n1. Place the instruments, etc., to be sterilised inside the copper\r\nbasket, and replace the basket in the steriliser.\r\n\r\n2. Pour a sufficient quantity of water into the steriliser, shut down\r\nthe lid, and light the gas below.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.--Koch's steriliser.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.--Arnold's steriliser.]\r\n\r\n3. After the water has boiled and steam has been issuing from beneath\r\nthe lid for at least ten minutes, extinguish the gas, open the lid, and\r\nlift out the wire basket by its handles and rest it diagonally on the\r\nwalls of the steriliser; the contained instruments, etc., are now\r\nsterile and ready for use.\r\n\r\n4. After use, or when accidentally contaminated, replace the instruments\r\nin the basket and return that to the steriliser; completely disinfect by\r\na further boiling for fifteen minutes.\r\n\r\n5. After disinfection, and whilst still hot, take out the instruments,\r\ndry carefully and at once, and return them to their store cases.\r\n\r\n_Streaming steam_--i. e., steam at 100 deg. C.--destroys the vegetative\r\nforms of bacteria in from fifteen to twenty minutes, and the sporing\r\nforms in from one to two hours. This method is chiefly used for the\r\nsterilisation of the various nutrient media intended for the cultivation\r\nof bacteria, and is carried out in a steam kettle of special\r\nconstruction, known as Koch's steam steriliser (Fig. 28) or in one of\r\nits many modifications, the most efficient of which is Arnold's (Fig.\r\n29).\r\n\r\nThe steam steriliser in its simplest form consists of a tall tinned-iron\r\nor copper cylindrical vessel, divided into two unequal parts by a\r\nmovable perforated metal diaphragm, the lower, smaller portion serving\r\nfor a water reservoir, and the upper part for the reception of wire\r\nbaskets containing the articles to be sterilised. The vessel is closed\r\nby a loose conical lid, provided with handles, and perforated at its\r\napex by a tubulure; it is mounted on a tripod stand and heated from\r\nbelow by a Bunsen burner. The more elaborate steriliser is cased with\r\nfelt or asbestos board, and provided with a water gauge, also a tap for\r\nemptying the water compartment.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO USE THE STEAM STERILISER.--\r\n\r\n1. Fill the water compartment to the level of the perforated diaphragm,\r\nplace the lid in position, and light the Bunsen burner.\r\n\r\n2. After the water has boiled, allow sufficient time to elapse for steam\r\nto replace the air in the sterilising compartment, as shown by the steam\r\nissuing in a steady, continuous stream from the tubulure in the lid.\r\n\r\n3. Remove the lid, quickly lower the wire basket containing media tubes,\r\netc., into the sterilising compartment until it rests on the diaphragm,\r\nand replace the lid.\r\n\r\n4. After an interval of twenty minutes in the case of fluid media, or\r\nthirty minutes in the case of solid media, take off the lid and remove\r\nthe basket with its contents.\r\n\r\n5. Now, but not before, extinguish the gas.\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--After removing tubes, flasks, etc., from the steam\r\n     steriliser, they should be at once separated freely in order\r\n     to prevent moisture condensing upon the cotton-wool plugs\r\n     and soaking through into the interior of the tubes.\r\n\r\nThis treatment will destroy any vegetative forms of bacteria; during the\r\nhours of cooling any spores present will germinate, and the young\r\norganisms will be destroyed by repeating the process twenty-four hours\r\nlater; a third sterilisation after a similar interval makes assurance\r\ndoubly sure.\r\n\r\nThe method of sterilising by exposure to streaming steam at 100 deg. C.\r\nfor twenty minutes on each of three consecutive days is termed\r\n_discontinuous_ or _intermittent sterilisation_.\r\n\r\nExposure to steam at 100 deg. C. for a period of one or two hours, or\r\n_continuous sterilisation_, cannot always be depended upon and is\r\ntherefore not to be recommended.\r\n\r\n_Superheated steam_--i. e., steam under pressure (see\r\nPressure-temperature table, Appendix, page 500) in sealed vessels at a\r\ntemperature of 115 deg. C.--will destroy both the vegetative and the\r\nsporing forms of bacteria within fifteen minutes; if the pressure is\r\nincreased, and the temperature raised to 120 deg. C., the same end is\r\nattained in ten minutes. This method was formerly employed for the\r\nsterilisation of media (and indeed is so used in some laboratories\r\nstill), but most workers now realise that media subjected to this high\r\ntemperature undergo hydrolytic changes which render them unsuitable for\r\nthe cultivation of the more delicate micro-organisms. The use of\r\nsuperheated steam should be restricted almost entirely to the\r\ndisinfection of such contaminated articles, old cultivations, etc., as\r\ncannot be dealt with by dry heat or the actual furnace. Sterilisation\r\nby means of superheated steam is carried out in a special\r\nboiler--Chamberland's autoclave (Fig. 30). The autoclave consists of a\r\nstout copper cylinder, provided with a copper or gun-metal lid, which\r\nis secured in place by means of bolts and thumbscrews, the joint between\r\nthe cylinder and its lid being hermetically sealed by the interposition\r\nof a rubber washer. The cover is perforated for a branched tube carrying\r\na vent cock, a manometer, and a safety valve. The copper boiler is\r\nmounted in the upper half of a cylindrical sheet-iron case--two\r\nconcentric circular rows of Bunsen burners, each circle having an\r\nindependent gas-supply, occupying the lower half. In the interior of the\r\nboiler is a large movable wire basket, mounted on legs, for the reception\r\nof the articles to be sterilised.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO USE THE AUTOCLAVE.--\r\n\r\n1. Pack the articles to be sterilised in the wire basket.\r\n\r\n2. Run water into the boiler to the level of the bottom of the basket;\r\nalso fill the contained flasks and tubes with water.\r\n\r\n3. See that the rubber washer is in position, then replace the cover and\r\nfasten it tightly on to the autoclave by means of the thumbscrews.\r\n\r\n4. Open the vent cock and light both rings of burners.\r\n\r\n5. When steam is issuing in a steady, continuous stream from the vent\r\ntube, shut off the vent cock and extinguish the outer ring of gas\r\nburners.\r\n\r\n6. Wait until the index of the manometer records a temperature of 120 deg.\r\nC., then regulate the gas and the spring safety valve in such a manner\r\nthat this temperature is just maintained, and leave it thus for twenty\r\nminutes. In the more expensive patterns of autoclave this regulation of\r\nthe safety valve is carried out automatically, the manometer being\r\nfitted with an adjustable pointer which can be set to any required\r\npressure-temperature and so arranged that when the index of the\r\nmanometer coincides with the adjustable hand the safety valve is opened.\r\n\r\n7. Extinguish the gas and allow the manometer index to fall to zero.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.--Chamberland's Autoclave.]\r\n\r\n8. Now open the vent cock slowly, and allow the internal pressure to\r\nadjust itself to that of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n9. Remove the cover and take out the sterilised contents.\r\n\r\n~Sterilisation Periods.~--An exceedingly useful device for the timing of\r\nsterilisation periods (and indeed for many other operations in the\r\nlaboratory) is the\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRIC SIGNAL TIMING CLOCK.\r\n\r\nThis is a clock of American type in which the face is surrounded by a\r\nmetal plate having a series of 60 holes at equal distances apart,\r\ncorresponding to the minutes on the dial. This plate is connected with\r\none of the poles of a dry battery, the other pole of which is connected\r\nto the metal case of the clock for the purpose of actuating an ordinary\r\nmagnet alarm bell. In the centre of each of the holes in the plate a\r\nmetal rod is fixed, which then passes through an insulating ring and\r\nprojects inside the clock face, where it makes contact with the hour\r\nhand. The clock is mounted on a heavy base, with a key-board containing\r\n20 numbered plugs. If one of the plugs is inserted in a hole in the\r\nplate it makes contact with the rod, and when the hour hand of the clock\r\ntouches the other end the circuit is completed and the bell starts\r\nringing. The period of this friction contact is approximately 20\r\nseconds. The clock can therefore be used for electrically noting the\r\nperiods of time from one minute by multiples of one minute up to one\r\nhour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.--Electric signal timing clock.]\r\n\r\n~Filtration.~--(a) _Cotton-wool Filter._--Practically the only method in\r\nuse in the laboratory for the sterilisation of air or of a gas is by\r\nfiltration through dry cotton-wool or glass-wool, the fibres of which\r\nentangle the micro-organisms and prevent their passage.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the best example of such a filter is the cotton-wool plug which\r\ncloses the mouth of a culture tube. Not only does ordinary diffusion\r\ntake place through it, but if a tube plugged in the usual manner with\r\ncotton-wool is removed from the hot incubator, the temperature of the\r\ncontained air rapidly falls to that of the laboratory, and a partial\r\nvacuum is formed; air passes into the tube, through the cotton-wool\r\nplug, to restore the equilibrium, and, so long as the plug remains dry,\r\nin a germ-free condition. If, however, the plug becomes moist, either by\r\nabsorption from the atmosphere, or from liquids coming into contact with\r\nit, micro-organisms (especially the mould fungi) commence to multiply,\r\nand the long thread forms rapidly penetrate the substance of the plug,\r\nand gain access to and contaminate the interior of the tube.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.--Cotton-wool air filter.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD.--\r\n\r\nIf it is desired to sterilise gases before admission to a vessel\r\ncontaining a pure cultivation of a micro-organism, as, for instance,\r\nwhen forcing a current of oxygen over or through a broth cultivation of\r\nthe diphtheria bacillus, this can be readily effected as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Take a length of glass tubing of, say, 1.5 cm. diameter, in the\r\ncentre of which a bulb has been blown, fill the bulb with dry\r\ncotton-wool (Fig. 32), wrap a layer of cotton-wool around each end of\r\nthe tube, and secure in position with a turn of thin copper wire or\r\nstring; then sterilise the piece of apparatus in the hot-air oven.\r\n\r\n2. Prepare the cultivation in a Ruffer or Woodhead flask (Fig. 33) the\r\ninlet tube of which has its free extremity enveloped in a layer of\r\ncotton-wool, secured by thread or wire, whilst the exit tube is plugged\r\nin the usual manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.--Ruffer's flask.]\r\n\r\n3. Sterilise a short length of rubber tubing by boiling. Transfer it\r\nfrom the boiling water to a beaker of absolute alcohol.\r\n\r\n4. When all is ready remove the rubber tube from the alcohol by means of\r\na pair of forceps, drain it thoroughly, and pass through the flame of a\r\nBunsen burner to burn off the last traces of alcohol.\r\n\r\n5. Remove the cotton-wool wraps from the entry tube of the flask and\r\nfrom one end of the filter tube and rapidly couple them up by means of\r\nthe sterile rubber tubing.\r\n\r\n6. Connect the other end of the bulb tube with the delivery tube from\r\nthe gas reservoir.\r\n\r\nThe gas in its passage through the dry sterile cotton-wool in the bulb\r\nof the filter tube will be freed from any contained micro-organisms and\r\nwill enter the flask in a sterile condition.\r\n\r\n(b) _Porcelain Filter._--The sterilisation of liquids by filtration is\r\neffected by passing them through a cylindrical vessel, closed at one end\r\nlike a test-tube, and made either of porous \"biscuit\" porcelain,\r\nhard-burnt and unglazed (Chamberland system), or of Kieselguhr, a fine\r\ndiatomaceous earth (Berkefeld system), and termed a \"bougie\" or \"candle\"\r\n(Fig. 34).\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--In selecting candles for use in the laboratory avoid\r\n     those with metal fittings, since during sterilisation cracks\r\n     develop at the junction of the metal and the siliceous\r\n     material owing to the unequal expansion.\r\n\r\nIn this method the bacteria are retained in the pores of the filter\r\nwhile the liquid passes through in a germ-free condition.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that to be effective the pores of the filter must be\r\nextremely minute, and therefore the rate of filtration will usually be\r\nslow. Chamberland filter candles possess finer channels than Berkefeld\r\ncandles and consequently filter much more slowly. To overcome this\r\ndisadvantage, either aspiration or pressure, or a combination of these\r\ntwo forces, may be employed to hasten the process.\r\n\r\nDoultons white porcelain filters it may be noted are as efficient as the\r\nChamberland candles and filter rather more rapidly.\r\n\r\n_Apparatus Required._--\r\n\r\n1. Separatory funnel containing the unfiltered fluid.\r\n\r\n2. Sterile filter candle (Fig. 34), the open end fitted with a rubber\r\nstopper (Fig. 34, a) perforated to receive the delivery tube of the\r\nseparatory funnel, and its neck passed through a large rubber washer\r\n(Fig. 34, b) which fits the mouth of the filter flask.\r\n\r\n3. Sterile filter flask of suitable size, for the reception of the\r\nfiltered fluid, its mouth closed by a cotton-wool plug.\r\n\r\n4. Water injector Sprengel (see Fig. 38, c) pump, or Geryk's pump (an\r\nair pump on the hydraulic principle, sealed by means of low\r\nvapor-tension oil, Fig. 35).\r\n\r\nIf this latter is employed, a Wulff's bottle, fitted as a wash-bottle\r\nand containing sulphuric acid, must be interposed between the filter\r\nflask and the pump, in order to prevent moist air reaching the oil in\r\nthe pump.\r\n\r\n5. Air filter (_vide_ page 40) sterilised.\r\n\r\n6. Pressure tubing.\r\n\r\n7. Screw clamps (Fig. 36).\r\n\r\nMETHOD.--\r\n\r\n1. Couple the exhaust pipe of the suction pump with the lateral tube of\r\nthe filter flask (first removing the cotton-wool plug from this latter),\r\nby means of pressure tubing, interposing, if necessary, the wash-bottle\r\nof sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.--Porcelain filter candle.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.--Geryk air pump.]\r\n\r\n2. Remove the cotton-wool plug from the neck of the filter flask and\r\nadjust the porcelain candle in its place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.--Screw clamps.]\r\n\r\n3. Attach the nozzle of the separatory funnel to the filter candle by\r\nmeans of the perforated rubber stopper (Fig. 37).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.--Apparatus arranged for filtering--aspiration.]\r\n\r\n4. Open the tap of the funnel, and exhaust the air from the filter flask\r\nand wash-bottle; maintain the vacuum until the filtration is complete.\r\n\r\n5. When the filtration is completed close the tap of the funnel; adjust\r\na screw clamp to the pressure tubing attached to the lateral branch of\r\nthe filter flask; screw it up tightly, and disconnect the acid\r\nwash-bottle.\r\n\r\n6. Attach the air filter to the open end of the pressure tubing; open\r\nthe screw clamp gradually, and allow filtered air to enter the flask, to\r\nabolish the negative pressure.\r\n\r\n7. Detach the rubber tubing from the lateral branch of the flask, flame\r\nthe end of the branch in the Bunsen, and plug its orifice with sterile\r\ncotton-wool.\r\n\r\n8. Remove the filter candle from the mouth of the flask, flame the\r\nmouth, and plug the neck with sterile cotton-wool.\r\n\r\n9. Disinfect the filter candle and separatory funnel by boiling.\r\n\r\nIf it is found necessary to employ pressure in addition to or in place\r\nof suction, insert a perforated rubber stopper into the mouth of the\r\nseparatory funnel and secure in position with copper wire; next fit a\r\npiece of glass tubing through the stopper, and connect the external\r\norifice with an air-pressure pump of some kind (an ordinary foot pump\r\nsuch as is employed for inflating bicycle tyres is one of the most\r\ngenerally useful, for this purpose) or with a cylinder of compressed air\r\nor other gas.\r\n\r\nIn order to filter a large bulk of fluid very rapidly it is necessary to\r\nuse a higher pressure than glass would stand, and in these cases the\r\nmetal receptacle designed by Pakes (Fig. 38, a), to hold the filter\r\ncandle itself as well as the fluid to be filtered, should be employed.\r\n(A vacuum must also be maintained in the filter flask, by means of an\r\nexhaust pump, during the entire process.)\r\n\r\nThis piece of apparatus consists of a brass cylinder, capacity 2500\r\nc.c., with two shoulders; and an opening in the neck at each end,\r\nprovided with screw threads.\r\n\r\nA nut carrying a pressure gauge fits into the top screw; and into the\r\nbottom is fitted a brass cylinder carrying the filter candle and\r\nprolonged downwards into a delivery tube. Leakage is prevented by means\r\nof rubber washers.\r\n\r\nInto the top shoulder a tube is inserted, bent at right angles and\r\nprovided with a tap. All the brass-work is tinned inside (Fig. 38, a).\r\nIn use the reservoir is generally mounted on a tripod stand.\r\n\r\n~To Sterilise.~--\r\n\r\n1. Insert the filter candle into its cylinder and screw this loosely on.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.--Pakes' filtering reservoir--pressure and\r\naspiration.]\r\n\r\n2. Wrap a layer of cotton-wool around the delivery tube and fasten in\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n3. Remove the nut carrying the pressure gauge and plug the neck with\r\ncotton-wool.\r\n\r\n4. Heat the whole apparatus in the autoclave at 120 deg. C. for twenty\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nMETHOD.--\r\n\r\n1. Remove the apparatus from the autoclave, and allow it to cool.\r\n\r\n2. Screw home the box carrying the bougie.\r\n\r\n3. Set the apparatus up in position, with its delivery tube (from which\r\nthe cotton-wool wrapping has been removed) passing through a perforated\r\nrubber stopper in the neck of a filter flask.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.--Closed candle arranged for filtering.]\r\n\r\n4. Fill the fluid to be filtered into the cylinder and screw on the nut\r\ncarrying the pressure gauge. (This nut should be immersed in boiling\r\nwater for a few minutes previous to screwing on, in order to sterilise\r\nit.)\r\n\r\n5. Connect the horizontal arm of the entry tube with a cylinder of\r\ncompressed oxygen (or carbon dioxide, Fig. 38, b), by means of\r\npressure tubing.\r\n\r\n6. Connect the lateral arm of the filter flask with the exhaust pump\r\n(Fig. 38, c) and start the latter working.\r\n\r\n7. Open the tap of the gas cylinder; then open the tap on the entry tube\r\nof the filter cylinder and raise the pressure in its interior until the\r\ndesired point is recorded on the manometer. Maintain this pressure,\r\nusually one or one and a half atmospheres, until filtration is\r\ncompleted, by regulating the tap on the entry tube.\r\n\r\nSome forms of filter candle are made with the open end contracted into a\r\ndelivery nozzle, which is glazed. In this case the apparatus is fitted\r\nup in a slightly different manner; the fluid to be filtered is contained\r\nin an open cylinder into which the candle is plunged, while its delivery\r\nnozzle is connected with the filter flask by means of a piece of\r\nflexible pressure tubing (previously sterilised by boiling), as in\r\nfigure 39.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. THE MICROSCOPE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe essentials of a microscope for bacteriological work may be briefly\r\nsummed up as follows:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.--Microscope stand.]\r\n\r\nThe instrument, of the monocular type, must be of good workmanship and\r\nwell finished, rigid, firm, and free from vibration, not only when\r\nupright, but also when inclined to an angle or in the horizontal\r\nposition. The various joints and movements must work smoothly and\r\nprecisely, equally free from the defects of \"loss of time\" and\r\n\"slipping.\" All screws, etc., should conform to the Royal Microscopical\r\nSociety's standard. It must also be provided with good lenses and a\r\nsufficiently large stage. The details of its component parts, to which\r\nattention must be specially directed, are as follows:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.--Foot, three types.]\r\n\r\n~1. The Base or Foot~ (Fig. 40, a).--Two elementary forms--the tripod\r\n(Fig. 41, a) and the vertical column set into a plate known as the\r\n\"horse-shoe\" (Fig. 41, b)--serve as the patterns for countless\r\nmodifications in shape and size of this portion of the stand. The chief\r\ndesiderata--stability and ease of manipulation--are attained in the\r\nfirst by means of the \"spread\" of the three feet, which are usually shod\r\nwith cork; in the second, by the dead weight of the foot-plate. The\r\ntripod is mechanically the more correct form, and for practical use is\r\nmuch to be preferred. Its chief rival, the Jackson foot (Fig. 41, c),\r\nis based upon the same principle, and on the score of appearance has\r\nmuch to recommend it.\r\n\r\n~2.~ The ~body tube~ (Fig. 40, b) may be either that known as the \"long\"\r\nor \"English\" (length 250 mm.), or the \"short\" or \"Continental\" (length\r\n160 mm.). Neither length appears to possess any material advantage over\r\nthe other, but it is absolutely necessary to secure objectives which\r\nhave been manufactured for the particular tube length chosen. In the\r\nhigh-class microscope of the present day the body tube is usually\r\nshorter than the Continental, but is provided with a draw tube which,\r\nwhen fully extended, gives a tube length greater than the English, thus\r\npermitting the use of either form of objective.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.--Coarse adjustment.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.--Fine adjustment.]\r\n\r\n\r\n     For practical purposes the tube length = distance from the\r\n     end of the nosepiece to the eyeglass of the ocular. This is\r\n     the measurement referred to in speaking of \"long\" or \"short\"\r\n     tube.\r\n\r\n~3.~ The ~coarse adjustment~ (Fig. 40, c) should be a rack-and-pinion\r\nmovement, steadiness and smoothness of action being secured by means of\r\naccurately fitting dovetailed bearings and perfect correspondence\r\nbetween the teeth of the rack and the leaves of the pinion (Fig. 42).\r\nAlso provision should be made for taking up the \"slack\" (as by the\r\nscrews _AA_, Fig. 42).\r\n\r\n~4.~ The ~fine adjustment~ (Fig. 40, d) should on no account depend upon\r\nthe direct action of springs, but should be of the lever pattern,\r\npreferably the Nelson (Fig. 43). In this form the unequal length of the\r\narms of the lever secures very delicate movement, and, moreover, only a\r\nsmall portion of the weight of the body tube is transmitted to the\r\nthread of the vertical screw actuating the movement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.--Spindle head to fine adjustment.]\r\n\r\nA spindle milled head (Fig. 44) will be found a very useful device to\r\nhave fitted in place of the ordinary milled head controlling the fine\r\nadjustment. In this contrivance the axis of the milled head is prolonged\r\nupward in a short column, the diameter of which is one-sixth of that of\r\nthe head. The spindle can be rapidly rotated between the fingers for\r\nmedium power adjustments while the larger milled head can be slowly\r\nmoved when focussing high powers.\r\n\r\n~5.~ The ~stage~ (Fig. 40, e) should be square in shape and large in\r\narea--at least 12 cm.--flat and rigid, in order to afford a safe support\r\nfor the Petri dish used for plate cultivations; and should be supplied\r\nwith spring clips (removable at will) to secure the 3 by 1 glass slides.\r\n\r\nA mechanical stage must be classed as a necessity rather than a luxury\r\nso far as the bacteriologist is concerned, as when working with high\r\npowers, and especially when examining hanging-drop specimens, it is\r\nalmost impossible to execute sufficiently delicate movements with the\r\nfingers. In selecting a mechanical stage, preference should be given to\r\none which forms an integral part of the instrument (Fig. 45) rather than\r\none which needs to be clamped on to an ordinary plain stage every time\r\nit is required, and its traversing movements should be controlled by\r\nstationary milled heads (Fig. 45, _AA'_). The shape of the aperture is a\r\nnot unimportant point; it should be square to allow of free movement\r\nover the substage condenser. The mechanical stage should be tapped for\r\nthree (removable) screw studs to be used in place of the sliding bar, so\r\nthat if desired the Vernier finder (Fig. 45, _BB'_), such as is usually\r\nfitted to this class of stage, or a Maltwood finder, may be employed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.--Mechanical stage.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46.--Iris diaphragm.]\r\n\r\n~6. Diaphragm.~--Separate single diaphragms must be avoided; a revolving\r\nplate pierced with different sized apertures and secured below the stage\r\nis preferable, but undoubtedly the best form is the \"iris\" diaphragm\r\n(Fig. 46) which enters into the construction of the substage condenser.\r\n\r\n~7.~ The ~substage condenser~ is a necessary part of the optical outfit.\r\nIts purpose is to collect the beam of parallel rays of light reflected by\r\nthe plane mirror, by virtue of a short focus system of lenses, into a\r\ncone of large aperture (reducible at will by means of an iris diaphragm\r\nmounted as a part of the condenser), which can be accurately focussed on\r\nthe plane of the object. This focussing must be performed anew for each\r\nobject, on account of the variation in the thickness of the slides.\r\n\r\nThe form in most general use is that known as the Abbe (Fig. 47) and\r\nconsists of a plano-convex lens mounted above a biconvex lens. This\r\ncombination is carried in a screw-centering holder known as the substage\r\nbelow the stage of the microscope (Fig. 40 f), and must be accurately\r\nadjusted so that its optical axis coincides with that of the objective.\r\nVertical movement of the entire substage apparatus effected by means of\r\na rack and pinion is a decided advantage, and some means should be\r\nprovided for temporarily removing the condenser from the optical axis of\r\nthe microscope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47--Optical part of Abbe illuminator.]\r\n\r\nWith the oil immersion objective, however, an ~achromatic condenser~,\r\ngiving an illuminating cone of about 0.9, should be used if the full\r\nvalue of the lens is to be obtained. It is generally assumed that a good\r\nobjective requires an illuminating cone equivalent to two-thirds of its\r\nnumerical aperture. The best Abbe condenser transmits a cone of about\r\n.45 whilst the aperture of the 1/12 inch immersion lenses of different\r\nmakers varies from 1.0 to 1.4, hence, the efficiency of these lenses is\r\nmuch curtailed if the condenser is merely the Abbe. These improved\r\ncondensers must be absolutely centered to the objective and capable of\r\nvery accurate focussing otherwise much of their value is lost.\r\n\r\n~8. Mirrors.~--Below the substage condenser is attached a gymbal carrying\r\na reversible circular frame with a plane mirror on one side and a\r\nconcave mirror on the other (Fig. 40, g). The plane mirror is that\r\nusually employed, but occasionally, as for example when using low powers\r\nand with the condenser racked down and thrown out of the optical axis,\r\nthe concave mirror is used.\r\n\r\n~9. Oculars, or Eyepieces.~--Those known as the Huyghenian oculars (Fig.\r\n48) will be sufficient for all ordinary work without resorting to the\r\nmore expensive \"compensation\" oculars. Two or three, magnifying the\r\n\"real\" image (formed by the objective) four, six, or eight times\r\nrespectively, form a useful equipment.\r\n\r\nAs an accessory ~Ehrlich's Eyepiece~ is a very useful piece of apparatus\r\nwhen the enumeration of cells or bacteria has to be carried out. This is\r\nan ordinary eyepiece fitted with an adjustable square diaphragm operated\r\nby a lever projecting from the side of the mount. Three notches are made\r\nin one of the sides of the square and by moving the lever square\r\naperture can be reduced to three-quarters, one-half or one-quarter of\r\nthe original size.\r\n\r\n~10. Objectives.~--Three objectives are necessary: one for low-power\r\nwork--e. g., 1 inch, 2/3 inch, or 1/2 inch; one for high-power\r\nwork--e. g., 1/12 inch oil immersion lens; and an intermediate\r\n\"medium-power\" lens--e. g., 1/6 inch or 1/8 inch (dry). These lenses\r\nmust be carefully selected, especial attention being paid to the\r\nfollowing points:\r\n\r\n(a) _Correction of Spherical Aberration._--Spherical aberration gives\r\nrise to an ill-defined image, due to the central and peripheral rays\r\nfocussing at different points.\r\n\r\n(b) _Correction of Chromatic Aberration._--Chromatic aberration gives\r\nrise to a coloured fringe around the edges of objects due to the fact\r\nthat the different-coloured rays of the spectrum possess varying\r\nrefrangibilities and that a simple lens acts toward them as a prism.\r\n\r\n(c) _Flatness of Field._--The ideal visual field would be large and,\r\nabove all, _flat_; in other words, objects at the periphery of the field\r\nwould be as distinctly \"in focus\" as those in the centre. Unfortunately,\r\nhowever, this is an optical impossibility and the field is always\r\nspherical in shape. Some makers succeed in giving a larger central area\r\nthat is in focus at one time than others, and although this may\r\ntheoretically cause an infinitesimal sacrifice of other qualities, it\r\nshould always be sought for. Successive zones and the entire peripheral\r\nring should come into focus with the alteration of the fine adjustment.\r\nThis simultaneous sharpness of the entire circle is an indication of the\r\nperfect centering of the whole of the lenses in the objective.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48.--Huyghenian eyepiece.]\r\n\r\n(d) _Good Definition._--Actual magnification is, within limits, of\r\ncourse, of less value than clear definition and high resolving power,\r\nfor it is upon these properties we depend for our knowledge of the\r\ndetailed structure of the objects examined.\r\n\r\n(e) _Numerical Aperture_ (_N. A._).--The numerical aperture may be\r\ndefined, in general terms, as the ratio of the _effective_ diameter of\r\nthe back lens of the objective to its equivalent focal length. The\r\ndetermination of this point is a process requiring considerable\r\ntechnical skill and mathematical ability, and is completely beyond the\r\npowers of the average microscopist.[1]\r\n\r\nAlthough with the increase in power it is correspondingly difficult to\r\ncombine all these corrections in one objective, they are brought to a\r\nhigh pitch of excellence in the present-day \"achromatic\" objectives, and\r\nso remove the necessity for the use of the higher priced and less\r\ndurable apochromatic lenses.\r\n\r\nIn selecting objectives the best \"test\" objects to employ are:\r\n\r\n1. A thin (one cell layer), even    }     { 1\", 2/3\", 1/2\":\r\n\"blood film,\" stained with Jenner's } for { 1/6\", 1/8\"\r\nor Romanowsky's stain.              }     { 1/12\" oil\r\n\r\n2. A thin cover-slip preparation    }\r\nof a young cultivation of           }     { 1/8\" dry\r\n_B. diphtheriae_ (showing           } for {\r\nsegmentation) stained with          }     { 1/12\" oil\r\nmethylene-blue.                     }\r\n\r\n~Accessories.~--_Eye Shade_ (Fig. 49).--This piece of apparatus consists\r\nof a pear-shaped piece of blackened metal or ebonite, hinged to a collar\r\nwhich rotates on the upper part of the body tube of the microscope. It\r\ncan be used to shut out the image of surrounding objects from the\r\nunoccupied eye, and when carrying out prolonged observations will be\r\nfound of real service.\r\n\r\n_Nosepiece._--Perhaps the most useful accessory is a nosepiece to carry\r\ntwo of the objectives (Fig. 50), or, better still, all three (Fig. 51).\r\nThis nosepiece, preferably constructed of aluminium, must be of the\r\ncovered-in type, consisting of a curved plate attached to the lower end\r\nof the body tube--a circular aperture being cut to correspond to the\r\nlumen of that tube. To the under surface of this plate is pivoted a\r\nsimilarly curved plate, fitted with three tubulures, each of which\r\ncarries an objective. By rotating the lower plate each of the objectives\r\ncan be brought successively in to the optical axis of the microscope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.--Eye shade.]\r\n\r\nFor critical work and particularly for photo-micrography, however, the\r\ninterchangeable nosepiece is by no means perfect as it is next to\r\nimpossible to secure accurate centreing of each lens in the optical\r\naxis. For special purposes, therefore, it is necessary to employ a\r\nspecial nosepiece such as that made by Zeiss or Leitz into which each\r\nobjective slides on its own carrier and upon which it is accurately\r\ncentred.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.--Double nosepiece.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.--Triple nosepiece.]\r\n\r\n_Warm Stage_ (Fig. 52).--This is a flat metal case containing a system\r\nof tubes through the interior of which water of any required temperature\r\ncan be circulated. It is made to clamp on to the stage of the\r\nmicroscope by the screws _A A'_, and is perforated with a large hole\r\ncoinciding with the optical axis of the microscope; a short tube B,\r\nprojecting from one end of the warm stage permits water of the desired\r\ntemperature to be conducted from a reservoir through a length of rubber\r\ntubing to the interior of the stage and a similar tube at the other end\r\n_B'_ of the stage allows exit to the waste water. By raising the\r\ntemperature of hanging-drop preparations, etc., placed upon it, above\r\nthat of the surrounding atmosphere, the warm stage renders possible\r\nexact observations on spore germination, hanging-drop cultivations, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52.--Warm stage.]\r\n\r\nA better form is the electrical hot stage designed by Lorrain Smith;[2]\r\nit requires the addition of a lamp resistance and sliding rheostat, also\r\na delicate ammeter reading to .01 of an ampere. It consists of a wooden\r\nframe supporting a flat glass bulb with a long neck bent upward at an\r\nobtuse angle (Fig. 53). The bulb is filled with liquid paraffin, which\r\nrises in the open neck when expanded by heat. The neck also accommodates\r\nthe thermometer. Two coils of manganin wire run in the paraffin at\r\nopposite sides of the bulb (outside the field of vision), coupled to\r\nbrass terminals on the wooden frame by platinum wire fused into the\r\nglass. The resistance of the two coils in series is about 10 ohms. A\r\ncurrent of 2-1/2 amperes is needed, and is conducted to the coils in the\r\nstage through the rheostat. With the help of the ammeter any desired\r\ntemperature can be obtained and maintained, up to about 200 deg. C. If\r\nimmersion oil contact is made between the top lens of the condenser and\r\nthe lower surface of the bulb, this stage works very well indeed with\r\nthe 1/12-inch oil immersion lens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53.--Lorrain Smith's warm stage.]\r\n\r\n_Dark Ground or Paraboloid Condenser._--This is an immersion substage\r\ncondenser of high aperture by means of which unstained objects such as\r\nbacteria can be shown as bright white particles upon a dense black\r\nbackground. The central rays of light are blocked out by means of an\r\nopaque stop while the peripheral rays are reflected from the\r\nparaboloidal sides of the condenser and refracted by the object viewed.\r\nTo obtain the best results with this type of condenser a powerful\r\nilluminant--such as a small arc lamp or an incandescent gas lamp--is\r\nneeded, together with picked slides of a certain thickness (specified\r\nfor the particular make of condenser but generally 1 mm.) and specially\r\nthin cover-glasses (not more than 0.17 mm.) The objective must not have\r\na higher NA than 1.0, consequently immersion lenses must be fitted with\r\nan internal stop to cut down the aperture.\r\n\r\n_Micrometer._--Some form of micrometer for the purpose of measuring\r\nbacteria and other objects is also essential. Details of those in\r\ngeneral use will be found in the following pages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54--Diamond Object marker.]\r\n\r\n_Object Marker_ (Fig. 54).--This is an exceedingly useful piece of\r\napparatus. Made in the form of an objective, the lenses are replaced by\r\na diamond point, set slightly out of the centre, which can be rotated by\r\nmeans of a milled plate. Screwed on to the nosepiece in place of the\r\nobjective, rotation of the diamond point will rule a small circle on the\r\nobject slide to permanently record the position of an interesting\r\nportion of the specimen. The diamond is mounted on a spring which\r\nregulates the pressure, and the size of the circle can be adjusted by\r\nmeans of a lateral screw.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF MICROMETRY.\r\n\r\nThe unit of length as applied to the measurement of microscopical\r\nobjects is the one-thousandth part of a millimetre (0.001 mm.),\r\ndenominated a _micron_ (sometimes, and erroneously, referred to as a\r\nmicro-millimetre), and indicated in writing by the Greek letter mu. Of\r\nthe many methods in use for the measurement of bacteria, three only will\r\nbe here described, viz.:\r\n\r\n(a) By means of the Camera Lucida.\r\n\r\n(b) By means of the ocular or Eyepiece Micrometer.\r\n\r\n(c) By means of the Filar Micrometer (Ramsden's micrometer eyepiece).\r\n\r\nFor each of these methods a ~stage micrometer~ is necessary. This is a 3\r\nby 1 inch glass slip having engraved on it a scale divided to hundredths\r\nof a millimetre (0.01 mm.), every tenth line being made longer than the\r\nintervening ones, to facilitate counting; and from these engraved lines\r\nthe measurement in every case is evaluated. A cover-glass is cemented\r\nover the scale to protect it from injury.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55.--Camera lucida, Abbe pattern.]\r\n\r\n(a) By means of the Camera Lucida.\r\n\r\n1. Attach a camera lucida (of the Wollaston, Beale, or Abbe pattern)\r\n(Fig. 55) to the eyepiece of the microscope.\r\n\r\n2. Adjust the micrometer on the stage of the microscope and accurately\r\nfocus the divisions.\r\n\r\n3. Project the scale of the stage micrometer on to a piece of paper and\r\nwith pen or pencil sketch in the magnified image, each division of which\r\ncorresponds to 10 mu. Mark on the paper the optical combination (ocular\r\nobjective and tube length) employed to produce this particular\r\nmagnification.\r\n\r\n4. Repeat this procedure for each of the possible combinations of\r\noculars and objectives fitted to the microscope supplied, and carefully\r\npreserve the scales thus obtained.\r\n\r\nTo measure an object by this method simply project the image on to the\r\nscale corresponding to the particular optical combination in use at the\r\nmoment. Read off the number of divisions it occupies and express them as\r\n_micra_.\r\n\r\nIn place of preserving a scale for each optical combination, the object\r\nto be measured and the micrometer scale may be projected and sketched,\r\nin turn, on the same piece of paper, taking particular care that the\r\ncentre of the eyepiece is 25 cm. from the paper on which the divisions\r\nare drawn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56.--Eyepiece micrometer, ordinary.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57.--Eyepiece micrometer, net.]\r\n\r\n(b) By means of the Eyepiece Micrometer.\r\n\r\nThe ~eyepiece micrometer~ is a circular glass disc having engraved on it a\r\nscale divided to tenths of a millimetre (0.1 mm.) (Fig. 56), or the\r\nentire surface ruled in 0.1 mm. squares (the net micrometer) (Fig. 57).\r\nIt can be fitted inside the mount of any ocular just above the aperture\r\nof the diaphragm and must be adjusted exactly in the focus of the eye\r\nlens.\r\n\r\nSome makers mount the glass disc together with a circular cover-glass in\r\nsuch a way that when placed in position in any Huyghenian eyepiece of\r\ntheir own manufacture, the scale is exactly in focus for normal vision.\r\nSpecial eyepieces are also obtainable having a sledging adjustment to\r\nthe eye lens for focussing the micrometer.\r\n\r\nThe value of one division of the micrometer scale must first be\r\nascertained for each optical combination by the aid of the stage\r\nmicrometer, thus:\r\n\r\n1. Insert the eyepiece micrometer inside the ocular and adjust the stage\r\nmicrometer on the stage of the microscope.\r\n\r\n2. Focus the scale of the stage micrometer accurately; the lines will\r\nappear to be immediately below those of the eyepiece micrometer. Make\r\nthe lines on the two micrometers parallel by rotating the ocular.\r\n\r\n3. Make two of the lines on the ocular micrometer coincide with those\r\nbounding one division of the stage micrometer; this is effected by\r\nincreasing or diminishing the tube length; and note the number of\r\nincluded divisions.\r\n\r\n4. Calculate the value of each division of the eyepiece micrometer in\r\nterms of  mu, by means of the following formula:\r\n\r\n    x = 10 y.\r\n\r\n    Where x = the number of included divisions of the\r\n                        eyepiece micrometer.\r\n\r\n          y = the number of included divisions of the\r\n                       stage micrometer.\r\n\r\n5. Note the optical combination employed in this experiment and record\r\nit with the calculated micrometer value.\r\n\r\nRepeat this process for each of the other combinations. Carefully record\r\nthe results.\r\n\r\nTo measure an object by this method read off the number of divisions of\r\nthe eyepiece micrometer it occupies and express the result in _micra_ by\r\na reference to the standard value for the particular optical combination\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nZeiss prepares a compensating eyepiece micrometer for use with his\r\napochromatic objectives, the divisions of which are so computed that\r\n(with a tube length of 160 mm.) the value of each is equivalent to as\r\nmany _micra_ as there are millimetres in the focal length of the\r\nobjective employed.\r\n\r\n_Wright's Eikonometer_ is really a modification of the eyepiece\r\nmicrometer for rapidly measuring microscopical objects by direct\r\ninspection, having previously determined the magnifying power of the\r\nparticular optical combination employed. It is a small piece of\r\napparatus resembling an eyepiece, with a sliding eye lens, which can be\r\naccurately focussed on a micrometer scale fixed within the instrument.\r\nWhen placed over the microscope ocular the divisions of this scale\r\nmeasure the actual size of the virtual image in millimetres.\r\n\r\nIn order to use this instrument for direct measurement, it is first\r\nnecessary to determine the magnifying power of each combination of\r\nocular, tube length and objective.\r\n\r\nPlace a stage micrometer divided into hundredths of a millimetre on the\r\nmicroscope stage and focus accurately.\r\n\r\nRest the eikonometer on the eyepiece. Observation through the\r\neikonometer shows its micrometer scale superposed on the image of the\r\nstage micrometer.\r\n\r\nRotate the eikonometer until the lines on the two scales are parallel,\r\nand make the various adjustments to ensure that two lines on the\r\neikonometer scale coincide with two lines on the stage micrometer.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of illustration it may be assumed that five of the\r\ndivisions on the stage micrometer accurately fill one of the divisions\r\nof the eikonometer scale; this indicates a magnifying power of 500 as\r\nthe constant for that particular optical combination, and a record\r\nshould be made of the fact.\r\n\r\nThe magnification constants of the various other optical combinations\r\nshould be similarly made and recorded.\r\n\r\nTo measure any object subsequently it should be first focussed carefully\r\nin the ordinary way.\r\n\r\nThe eikonometer should then be applied to the eyepiece and the size of\r\nthe object read off on the eikonometer scale as millimetres, and the\r\nactual size calculated by dividing the observed size by the\r\nmagnification constant for the particular optical combination employed\r\nin the observation.\r\n\r\n(c) By means of the filar micrometer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 58.--Ramsden's Filar micrometer.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 59.--Ramsden's micrometer field, a, fixed wire;\r\nb, reference wire (fixed); c, travelling wire.]\r\n\r\nThe ~Filar~ or cobweb Micrometer (Ramsden's micrometer) eyepiece (Fig. 58)\r\nconsists of an ocular having a fine \"fixed\" wire stretching horizontally\r\nacross the field (Fig. 59), a vertical reference wire--fixed--adjusted\r\nat right angles to the first; and a fine wire, parallel to the reference\r\nwire, which can be moved across the field by the action of a micrometer\r\nscrew; the drum head is divided into one hundred parts, which\r\nsuccessively pass a fixed index as the head is turned. In the lower part\r\nof the field is a comb with the intervals between its teeth\r\ncorresponding to one complete revolution of this screw-head.\r\n\r\nAs in the previous method, the value of each division of the micrometer\r\nscale (i. e., the comb) must first be determined for each optical\r\ncombination. This is effected as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Place the filar micrometer and the stage micrometer in their\r\nrespective positions.\r\n\r\n2. Rotate the screw of the filar micrometer until the movable wire\r\ncoincides with the fixed one, and the index marks zero on the drum head.\r\n(If when the drum head is at zero the two wires do not exactly coincide\r\nthey must be adjusted by loosening the drum screw and resetting the\r\ndrum.)\r\n\r\n3. Focus the scale of each micrometer accurately, and make the lines on\r\nthem parallel.\r\n\r\n4. Rotate the head of the micrometer screw until the movable line has\r\ntransversed one division of the stage micrometer. Note the number of\r\ncomplete revolutions (by means of the recording comb) and the fractions\r\nof a revolution (by means of scale on the head of the micrometer screw),\r\nwhich are required to measure the 0.01 mm.\r\n\r\n5. Make several such estimations and average the results.\r\n\r\n6. Note the optical combination employed in this experiment and record\r\nit carefully, together with the micrometer value in terms of  mu.\r\n\r\n7. Repeat this process for each of the different optical combinations\r\nand record the results.\r\n\r\nTo measure an object by this method, simply note the number of\r\nrevolutions and fractions of a revolution of the screw-head required to\r\ntraverse such object from edge to edge, and express the result as\r\n_micra_ by reference to the recorded values for that particular optical\r\ncombination.\r\n\r\n_Microscope Illuminant._--In tropical and subtropical regions diffuse\r\ndaylight is the best illuminant. In temperate climes however daylight of\r\nthe desirable quantity is not always available, and recourse must be\r\nhad to oil lamps, gas lamps--preferably those with incandescent\r\nmantles--and electricity; and of these the last is undoubtedly the best.\r\nA handy lamp holder which can be manufactured in the laboratory is shown\r\nin Fig. 60. It consists of a base board weighted with lead to which is\r\nattached the ordinary domestic lamp holder, and behind this is fastened\r\na curved sheet-iron reflector. An obscured metal filament lamp of about\r\n16 candle power gives the most suitable light, and if monochromatic\r\nlight is needed, the blue grease pencil is streaked over the side of the\r\nlamp nearest the microscope; the current is switched on and when the\r\nglass bulb is warm, rubbing with a wad of cotton-wool will readily\r\ndistribute the blue greasy material in an even film over the ground\r\nglass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60.--Electric microscope lamp.]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Its importance will be realised, however, when it is stated in the\r\nwords of the late Professor Abbe: \"The numerical aperture of a lens\r\ndetermines all its essential qualities; the brightness of the image\r\nincreases with a given magnification and other things being equal, as\r\nthe square of the aperture; the resolving and defining powers are\r\ndirectly related to it, the focal depth of differentiation of depths\r\nvaries inversely as the aperture, and so forth.\"\r\n\r\n[2] Made by Mr. Otto Baumbach, 10, Lime Grove, Manchester.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. MICROSCOPICAL EXAMINATION OF BACTERIA AND OTHER MICRO-FUNGI.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPARATUS AND REAGENTS USED IN ORDINARY MICROSCOPICAL EXAMINATION.\r\n\r\nThe following comprises the essential apparatus and reagents for routine\r\nwork with which each student should be provided.\r\n\r\n1. India-rubber \"change-mat\" upon which cover-glasses may be rested\r\nduring the process of staining.\r\n\r\n2. Squares of blotting paper about 10 cm., for drying cover-slips and\r\nslides.\r\n\r\n(The filter paper known as \"German lined\"--a highly absorbent, closely\r\nwoven paper, having an even surface and no loose \"fluff\" to adhere to\r\nthe specimens--is the most useful for this purpose.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61.--Disinfectant Jar.]\r\n\r\n3. Glass jar filled with 2 per cent. lysol solution for the reception of\r\ninfected cover-glasses and infected pipettes, etc.\r\n\r\n4. A square glazed earthenware box with a loose lining containing 2 per\r\ncent. lysol solution for the reception of infected material and used\r\nslides. The bottom of the lining is perforated so that when full the\r\nlining and its contents can be lifted bodily out of the box, when the\r\ndisinfectant solution drains away and the slides, etc., can easily be\r\nemptied out. The empty lining is then returned to the box with its\r\ndisinfectant solution (Fig. 61).\r\n\r\n5. Bunsen burner provided with \"peep-flame\" by-pass.\r\n\r\n6. Porcelain trough holding five or six hanging-drop slides (Fig. 62).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62.--Hanging-drop slides: a, Double cell seen from\r\nabove; b, single cell seen from the side.]\r\n\r\nThe best form of hanging-drop slide is a modification of Boettcher's\r\nglass ring slide, and is prepared by cementing a circular cell of tin,\r\n13 to 15 mm. diameter, and 1 to 2 mm. in height, to the centre of a 3 by\r\n1 slip by means of Canada balsam. It is often extremely convenient to\r\nhave two of these cells cemented close together on one slide (Fig. 62,\r\na).\r\n\r\n     Another form of hanging-drop slide is made in which a\r\n     circular or oval concavity or \"cell\" is ground out of the\r\n     centre of a 3 by 1 slip. These are more expensive, less\r\n     convenient to work with, and are more easily contaminated by\r\n     drops of material under examination, and should be carefully\r\n     avoided.\r\n\r\n7. Three aluminium rods (Fig. 63), each about 25 cm. long and carrying a\r\npiece of 0.015 gauge platino-iridium wire 7.5 cm. in length. The end of\r\none of the wires is bent round to form an oval loop, of about 1 mm. in\r\nits short diameter, and is termed a loop or an oese; the terminal 3 or 4\r\nmm. of another wire is flattened out by hammering it on a smooth iron\r\nsurface to form a \"spatula\"; the third is left untouched or is pointed\r\nby the aid of a file. These instruments are used for inoculating culture\r\ntubes and preparing specimens for microscopical examination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 63.--Ends of platinum rods. a, loop; b, spatula;\r\nc, needle.]\r\n\r\nThe method of mounting these wires may be described as follows:\r\n\r\nTake a piece of aluminium wire 25 cm. long and about 0.25 cm. in\r\ndiameter, and drill a fine hole completely through the wire about a\r\ncentimetre from one end. Sink a straight narrow channel along one side\r\nof the wire, in its long axis, from the hole to the nearest end, shallow\r\nat first, but gradually becoming deeper.\r\n\r\nOn the opposite side of the wire make a short cut, 2 mm. in length,\r\nleading from the hole in the same direction. [The use of a fine dental\r\ndrill and small circular saw, worked by a dental motor facilitates the\r\nmanufacture of these aluminium handled instruments.]\r\n\r\nNow pass one end of the platinum wire through the hole, turn up about 2\r\nmm. at right angles and press the short piece into the short cut. Turn\r\nthe long end of the wire sharply, also at right angles, and sink it into\r\nthe long channel so that it emerges from about the centre of the cut end\r\nof the aluminium wire (Fig. 63). A few sharp taps with a watch maker's\r\nhammer will now close in the sides of the two channels over the wire and\r\nhold it securely.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64.--Platinum rod in aluminium handle--method of\r\nmounting.\r\n\r\nThe platinum wire may be fused into the end of a piece of glass rod, but\r\nsuch a handle is vastly inferior to aluminium and is not to be\r\nrecommended.]\r\n\r\n8. Two pairs of sharp-pointed spring forceps (10 cm. long), one of which\r\nmust be kept perfectly clean and reserved for handling clean\r\ncover-slips, the other being for use during staining operations.\r\n\r\n9. A box of clean 3 by 1 glass slips.\r\n\r\n10. A glass capsule with tightly fitting (ground on) glass lid,\r\ncontaining clean cover-slips in absolute alcohol.\r\n\r\n11. One of Faber's \"grease pencils\" (yellow, red, or blue) for writing\r\non glass.\r\n\r\n12. A wooden rack (Fig. 65) with twelve drop-bottles (Fig. 66) each 60\r\nc.c. capacity, containing\r\n\r\n    Aniline water.\r\n\r\n    Gentian violet, saturated alcoholic solution.\r\n\r\n    Lugol's (Gram's) iodine.\r\n\r\n    Absolute alcohol.\r\n\r\n    Methylene-blue, }\r\n    Fuchsin, basic, } saturated alcoholic solution.\r\n\r\n    Neutral red, 1 per cent. aqueous solution.\r\n\r\n    Leishman's modified Romanowsky stain.\r\n\r\n    Carbolic acid, 5 per cent. aqueous solution.\r\n\r\n    Acetic acid, 1 per cent. solution.\r\n\r\n    Sulphuric acid, 25 per cent. solution.\r\n\r\n    Xylol.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65.--Staining rack, rubber change mat and lysol\r\npot.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 66.--Drop bottle.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 67.--Canada balsam pot.]\r\n\r\nAnd two pots with air-tight glass caps (Fig. 67), each provided with a\r\npiece of glass rod and filled respectively with Canada balsam dissolved\r\nin xylol, and sterile vaseline.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF EXAMINATION.\r\n\r\nBacteria, etc., are examined microscopically.\r\n\r\n    1. In the living state, unstained, or stained.\r\n    2. In the \"fixed\" condition (i. e., fixed, killed,\r\n       and stained by suitable methods).\r\n\r\nThe preparation of a specimen from a tube cultivation for examination by\r\nthese methods may be described as follows:\r\n\r\n~1. Living, Unstained.~--(a) _\"Fresh\" Preparation._--\r\n\r\n1. Clean and dry a 3 by 1 glass slip and place it on one of the squares\r\nof filter paper. Deposit a drop of water (preferably distilled) or a\r\ndrop of 1 per cent. solution of caustic potash, on the centre of the\r\nslip, by means of the platinum loop.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68.--Holding tubes for removing bacterial growth, as\r\nseen from the front.]\r\n\r\n     TECHNIQUE OF OPENING AND CLOSING A CULTURE TUBE.\r\n\r\n     2. Remove the tube cultivation from its rack or jar with the\r\n     left hand and ignite the cotton-wool plug by holding it to\r\n     the flame of the Bunsen burner. Extinguish the flame by\r\n     blowing on the plug, whilst rotating the tube on its long\r\n     axis, its mouth directed vertically upward, between the\r\n     thumb and fingers. (This operation is termed \"flaming the\r\n     plug,\" and is intended to destroy any micro-organisms that\r\n     may have become entangled in the loose fibres of the\r\n     cotton-wool, and which, if not thus destroyed, might fall\r\n     into the tube when the plug is removed and so accidentally\r\n     contaminate the cultivation.)\r\n\r\n     3. Hold the tube at or near its centre between the ends of\r\n     the thumb and first two fingers of the left hand, and allow\r\n     the sealed end to rest upon the back of the hand between the\r\n     thumb and forefinger, the plug pointing to the right. Keep\r\n     the tube as nearly in the horizontal position as is\r\n     consistent with safety, to diminish the risk of the\r\n     accidental entry of organisms (Fig. 68).\r\n\r\n     4. Take the handle of the loop between the thumb and\r\n     forefinger of the right hand, holding the instrument in a\r\n     position similar to that occupied by a pen or a paint-brush,\r\n     and sterilise the platinum portion by holding it in the\r\n     flame of a Bunsen burner until it is red hot. Sterilise the\r\n     adjacent portion of the aluminium handle by passing it\r\n     rapidly twice or thrice through the flame. After sterilising\r\n     it, the loop must not be allowed to leave the hand or to\r\n     touch against anything but the material it is intended to\r\n     examine, until it is finished with and has been again\r\n     sterilised.\r\n\r\n     5. Grasp the cotton-wool plug of the test-tube between the\r\n     little finger and the palm of the right hand (whilst still\r\n     holding the loop as directed in step 4), and remove it from\r\n     the mouth of the tube by a \"screwing\" motion of the right\r\n     hand.\r\n\r\n     6. Introduce the platinum loop into the tube and hold it in\r\n     this position until satisfied that it is quite cool. (The\r\n     cooling may be hastened by touching the loop on one of the\r\n     drops of moisture which are usually to be found condensed on\r\n     the interior of the glass tube, or by dipping it into the\r\n     condensation water at the bottom; at the same time care must\r\n     be taken in the case of cultures on solid media to avoid\r\n     touching either the medium or the growth.)\r\n\r\n     7. Remove a small portion of the growth by taking up a drop\r\n     of liquid, in the case of a fluid culture, in the loop; or\r\n     by touching the loop on the surface of the growth when the\r\n     culture is on solid medium; and withdraw the loop from the\r\n     tube without again touching the medium or the glass sides of\r\n     the tube.\r\n\r\n     8. Replace the cotton-wool plug in the mouth of the tube.\r\n\r\n9. Replace the tube cultivation in its rack or jar.\r\n\r\n10. Mix the contents of the loop thoroughly with the drop of water on\r\nthe 3 by 1 slide.\r\n\r\n11. Again sterilise the loop as directed in step 4, and replace it in\r\nits stand.\r\n\r\n12. Remove a cover-slip from the glass capsule by means of the\r\ncover-slip forceps, rest it for a moment on its edge, on a piece of\r\nfilter paper to remove the excess of alcohol, then pass it through the\r\nflame of the Bunsen burner. This burns off the remainder of the alcohol,\r\nand the cover-slip so \"flamed\" is now clean, dry, and sterile.\r\n\r\n13. Lower the cover-slip, still held in the forceps, on to the surface\r\nof the drop of fluid on the 3 by 1 slip, carefully and gently, to avoid\r\nthe inclusion of air bubbles.\r\n\r\n14. Examine microscopically (_vide infra_).\r\n\r\nDuring the microscopical examination, stains and other reagents may be\r\nrun in under a cover-slip by the simple method of placing a drop of the\r\nreagent in contact with one edge of the cover-glass and applying the\r\ntorn edge of a piece of blotting paper to the opposite side. The reagent\r\nmay then be observed to flow across the field and come into contact with\r\nsuch of the micro-organisms as lie in its path.\r\n\r\nThe non-toxic basic dyes most generally employed for the intra-vitam\r\nstaining of bacteria are\r\n\r\n    Neutral red,    }\r\n    Quinoleine blue }\r\n    Methylene green }  in 0.5 per cent. aqueous solutions.\r\n    Vesuvin,        }\r\n\r\n_Negative Stain_ (Burri).--By this method of demonstration the\r\nappearances presented by dark ground illumination (by means of a\r\nparaboloid condenser) are closely simulated, since minute particles,\r\nbacteria, blood or pus cells etc. stand out as brilliantly white or\r\ncolourless bodies on a dark grey-brown background.\r\n\r\n_Reagent required:_\r\n\r\nAny one of the liquid waterproof black drawing inks (Chin-chin, Pelican,\r\netc.). This is prepared for use as follows:\r\n\r\nMeasure out and mix:\r\n\r\n    Liquid black ink,       25 c.c.\r\n    Tincture of iodine       1 c.c.\r\n\r\nAllow the mixture to stand 24 hours, centrifugalise thoroughly, pipette\r\noff the supernatant liquid to a clean bottle and then add a crystal of\r\nthymol or one drop of formalin as a preservative.\r\n\r\nMETHOD.--\r\n\r\n1. With the sterilised loop deposit one drop of the liquid ink close to\r\none end of a 3 by 1 slide.\r\n\r\n2. With the sterilised loop deposit a drop of the fluid culture (or of\r\nan emulsion from a solid culture) by the side of the drop of ink (Fig.\r\n69, a); mix the two drops thoroughly by the aid of the loop.\r\n\r\n3. Sterilise the loop.\r\n\r\n4. Hold the slide firmly on the bench with the thumb and forefinger of\r\nthe left hand applied to the end nearest the drop of fluid.\r\n\r\n5. Take another clean 3 by 1 slide in the right hand and lower its short\r\nend obliquely (at an angle of about 60 deg.) transversely on to the mixed\r\nink and culture on the first slide, and allow the fluid to spread across\r\nthe slide and fill the angle of incidence.\r\n\r\n6. Maintaining the original angle, draw the second slide firmly and\r\nevenly along the first toward the end farthest from the left hand (Fig.\r\n69, b).\r\n\r\n7. Throw the second slide into a pot of disinfectant; allow the first\r\nslide to dry in the air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 69.--Spreading negative film.]\r\n\r\n8. Place a drop of immersion oil on the centre of the film, lower the\r\n1/12-inch objective into the oil and examine microscopically without the\r\nintervention of a cover-slip.\r\n\r\n(The film of ink may be covered with a long cover-glass and xylol balsam\r\nas a permanent preparation.)\r\n\r\n(<b) _Hanging-drop Preparation._--\r\n\r\n1. Smear a layer of sterile vaseline on the upper surface of the ring\r\ncell of a hanging-drop slide by means of the glass rod provided with the\r\nvaseline bottle, and place the slide on a piece of filter paper.\r\n\r\n2. \"Flame\" a cover-slip and place it on the filter paper by the side of\r\nthe hanging-drop slide.\r\n\r\n3. Place a drop of water on the centre of the cover-slip by means of the\r\nplatinum loop.\r\n\r\n4. Obtain a small quantity of the material it is desired to examine, in\r\nthe manner detailed above (pages 74-76, steps 2 to 11 must be followed\r\nin their entirety and with the strictest exactitude whenever tube\r\ncontents are being handled), and mix it with the drop of water on the\r\ncover-slip.\r\n\r\n5. Raise the cover-slip in the points of the forceps and rapidly invert\r\nit on to the ring cell of the hanging-drop slide, so that the drop of\r\nfluid occupies the centre of the ring. (Carefully avoid contact between\r\nthe drop of fluid and either the ring cell or the layer of vaseline.\r\nShould this happen, the now _infected_ hanging-drop slide and its\r\ncover-slip must be dropped into the pot of lysol and a new preparation\r\nmade.)\r\n\r\n6. Press the cover-slip firmly down into the vaseline on to the top of\r\nthe ring cell. (This spreads out the vaseline into a thin layer, and\r\nbesides ensuring the adhesion of the cover-slip, seals the cells and so\r\nretards evaporation.)\r\n\r\n7. Examine microscopically.\r\n\r\nThe examination of a \"fresh\" specimen or a \"hanging-drop\" preparation is\r\ndirected to the determination of the following data:\r\n\r\n1. The nature of the bacteria present--e. g., cocci, bacilli, etc.\r\n\r\n2. The purity of the cultivation; this can only be determined when gross\r\nmorphological differences exist between the organisms present.\r\n\r\n3. The presence or absence of spores; when present, spores show their\r\ntypical refrangibility exceedingly well by this method.\r\n\r\n4. The presence or absence of mobility. In a hanging-drop specimen some\r\nform of movement can practically always be observed, and its character\r\nmust be carefully determined by noting the relative positions of\r\nadjacent micro-organisms.\r\n\r\n(a) Brownian or molecular movement. Minute particles of solid matter\r\n(including bacteria), when suspended in a fluid, will always show a\r\nvibratory movement affecting the entire field, but never altering the\r\nrelative positions of the bacteria. (Cocci exhibit this movement, but\r\nwith the exception of the Micrococcus agilis, the cocci are non-motile.)\r\n\r\n(b) Streaming movement. This is due to currents set up in the hanging\r\ndrop as a result of jarring of the specimen or of evaporation, or to the\r\nfact that the cover-slip is not perfectly level, and although the\r\nrelative positions of the bacteria may vary, still the flowing movement\r\nof large numbers of organisms in some one direction will usually be\r\nsufficient to demonstrate the nature of this motion.\r\n\r\n(c) Locomotive movement, or ~true motility~, is determined by observing\r\nsome one particular bacillus changing its position in the field\r\nindependently of, and in a direction contrary to, other organisms\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nWhen the examination is completed and the specimen finished with, the\r\n\"fresh specimen\"--i. e., the slide with the cover-slip attached--must\r\nbe dropped into the lysol pot. In the hanging-drop specimen, however,\r\nthe cover-slip only is infected, and this may be raised from the ring\r\ncell by means of forceps and dropped into the disinfectant.\r\n\r\n_Permanent Staining of the Hanging-drop Specimen._--Occasionally it is\r\nnecessary to fix and stain a hanging-drop preparation. This may be done\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n1. Remove the cover-slip from the cell by the aid of the forceps.\r\n\r\n2. If the drop is small, fix it by dropping it face downward, whilst\r\nstill wet, on to the surface of some Gulland's solution or corrosive\r\nsublimate solution (_vide_ page 82) in a watch-glass. If the drop is\r\nlarge, place it face upward on the rubber mat, cover it with an inverted\r\nwatch-glass, and allow it to dry. Then fix it in the alcohol and ether\r\nsolution (_vide_, page 82).\r\n\r\n3. Dip the cover-glass into a beaker containing hot water in order to\r\nremove some of the vaseline adhering to it.\r\n\r\n4. Wash successively in alcohol, xylol, ether, and alcohol, to remove\r\nthe last traces of grease.\r\n\r\n5. Wash in water.\r\n\r\n6. Stain, wash, dry, and mount as for an ordinary cover-slip film\r\npreparation (_vide_ pages 83-85).\r\n\r\n~2. Killed, Stained.~--In this method three distinct processes are\r\nnecessary:\r\n\r\n    \"Preparing\" and \"fixing\" the film.\r\n    Staining.\r\n    Mounting.\r\n\r\n_Preparing the Film._--\r\n\r\n1. Flame a cover-slip and place it on a piece of filter paper.\r\n\r\n2. Place a drop of water on the centre of the cover-slip by means of\r\nplatinum loop.\r\n\r\n3. Obtain a small quantity of the material to be examined upon a\r\nsterilised platinum loop (see pages 74-76, steps 2 to 11) and mix it\r\nwith the drops of water on the cover-slip.\r\n\r\n4. Spread the drop of emulsion evenly over the cover-slip in the form of\r\na square film to within 1 mm. of each edge of the cover-slip.\r\n\r\n5. Allow it to dry completely in the air.\r\n\r\n_Fixing._--Fix by passing the cover-slip, held in the fingers, three or\r\nfour times through the flame of a Bunsen burner.\r\n\r\nIn some instances (e. g., when the films after staining are intended\r\nfor micrometric observations) it is almost essential to fix by exposure\r\nto a uniform temperature of 115 deg. C., for twenty minutes. This is best\r\ndone in a carefully regulated hot-air oven.\r\n\r\nFixation may also be effected by immersing in some fixative fluid, such\r\nas one of the following:\r\n\r\n1. Absolute alcohol, for five to fifteen minutes.\r\n\r\n                         { equal parts, for five to thirty\r\n    2. Absolute alcohol, { minutes (e. g., for blood or\r\n    Ether,               { milk).\r\n\r\n3. Osmic acid, 1 per cent. aqueous solution, for thirty seconds.\r\n\r\n4. Corrosive sublimate, saturated aqueous solution, for five minutes.\r\n\r\n5. Corrosive sublimate (Lang), for five minutes. This solution is\r\nprepared by dissolving:\r\n\r\n      Sodium chloride           0.75 gramme\r\n      Hydrarg. perchloride     12.00 grammes\r\n      Acetic acid               5.00 grammes\r\n      In distilled water      100.00 c.c.\r\n    Filter.\r\n\r\n6. Gulland's solution, for five minutes. This solution is prepared by\r\nmixing:\r\n\r\n    Absolute alcohol                                            25.0 c.c.\r\n    Ether                                                       25.0 c.c.\r\n    Corrosive sublimate, 20 per cent. alcoholic solution         0.4 c.c.\r\n\r\n7. Formalin 10 per cent. aqueous solution (= 4 per cent. aqueous\r\nsolution of formaldehyde since formalin is a 40 per cent. solution of\r\nthe gas in water).\r\n\r\nEither of these methods of fixation coagulates the albuminous material\r\nand ensures perfect adhesion of the film to the cover-slip.\r\n\r\n_Clearing._--Wash the cover-slip thoroughly in running water and proceed\r\nwith the staining.\r\n\r\nIf the film has been prepared from broth, liquefied gelatine, or pus or\r\nother morbid exudations, saturate the film after fixation with acetic\r\nacid 2 per cent. and allow it to act for two minutes.\r\n\r\nWash with alcohol, then let the alcohol remain on the cover-slip for two\r\nminutes. (This will \"clear\" the groundwork and give a much sharper and\r\ncleaner film than would otherwise be obtained.)\r\n\r\nIf the film has been prepared from blood or bloodstained fluid, treat\r\nwith acetic acid 2 per cent. for two minutes after fixation. Wash with\r\nwater, dry, and proceed with the staining. (This will remove the\r\nhaemoglobin and facilitate examination.)\r\n\r\n_Staining._--\r\n\r\n1. Rest the cover-slip, film side uppermost, on the rubber mat.\r\n\r\n2. By means of a drop-bottle, cover the film side of the cover-slip with\r\nthe selected stain, allow it to act for a few minutes, then wash off the\r\nexcess in running water.\r\n\r\nThe penetrating power of stains is increased by (a) physical\r\nmeans--e. g., heating the stain; (b) chemical means--e. g., by the\r\naddition of carbolic acid, 5 per cent. aqueous solution; caustic\r\nalkalies, 2 per cent. aqueous solutions; water saturated with aniline\r\noil; borax, 0.5 per cent. aqueous solution.\r\n\r\nThe most commonly used dyes for cover-slip film preparations are the\r\naniline dyes.\r\n\r\n    (A) Basic:\r\n      (a) Methylene-blue.\r\n      (b) Gentian violet.\r\n      (c) Fuchsin.\r\n\r\nThese dyes are kept in saturated alcoholic (90 per cent.) solutions so\r\nthat decomposition may be retarded.\r\n\r\nTwo or three drops of alcoholic solution of these dyes to, say, 4 c.c.\r\nwater, usually makes a sufficiently strong staining fluid for cover-slip\r\nfilm preparations.\r\n\r\nCarbolic methylene-blue (C.M.B.) and carbol fuchsin (C.F.) are prepared\r\nby covering the cover-slip with 5 per cent. solution of carbolic acid\r\nand adding a few drops of the saturated alcoholic solution of\r\nmethylene-blue or fuchsin respectively to it. For aniline gentian violet\r\n(A.G.V.) the stain is added to a saturated solution of aniline oil in\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n      (d) Thionine blue.\r\n      (e) Bismarck brown.\r\n      (f) Neutral red.\r\n    (B) Acid:\r\n      (a) Eosin, aqueous yellowish.\r\n      (b) Safranine.\r\n\r\nThese dyes are kept in 1 per cent. aqueous solution to which is added 5\r\nper cent. of alcohol, as a preservative. They are generally used in this\r\nform.\r\n\r\nA few nuclear stains (carmine, haematoxylin) are occasionally used more\r\nespecially in \"section\" work.\r\n\r\n_Decolourisation._--After overstaining, films may be decolourised by\r\nwashing for a longer or shorter time in one of the following reagents\r\narranged in ascending order of power\r\n\r\n1. Water.\r\n2. Chloroform.\r\n3. Acetic acid, 1 per cent.\r\n4. Alcohol.\r\n5. Alcohol absolute,         }   equal parts.\r\n   Acetic acid, 1 per cent., }\r\n\r\n                             {Hydrochloric, 1 per cent. aqueous solution.\r\n                             {Hydrochloric, 1 per cent. Alcoholic\r\n                             {  (90 per cent.) solution.\r\n6. Mineral acids:            {Sulphuric, 25 per cent. aqueous solution.\r\n                             {Nitric, 33 per cent. aqueous solution.\r\n\r\n_Counterstaining._--Use colours which will contrast with the first\r\nstain; e. g.,\r\n\r\nVesuvin,                     }\r\nNeutral red,                 }for films stained by methylene-blue or\r\nEosin,                       }Gram's method.\r\nFuchsin,                     }\r\n\r\nMethylene-blue,              }for films stained by fuchsin.\r\nGentian violet,              }\r\n\r\n8. _Mounting._--\r\n\r\n1. Wash the film carefully in running water.\r\n\r\n2. Blot off the superfluous water with the filter paper, or dry more\r\ncompletely between two folds of blotting paper.\r\n\r\n3. Complete the drying in the air, or by holding the cover-slip in the\r\nfingers at a safe distance above the flame of the Bunsen burner.\r\n\r\n4. Place a drop of xylol balsam on the centre of a clean 3 by 1 glass\r\nslide and invert the cover-slip over the balsam, and lower it carefully\r\nto avoid the inclusion of air bubbles.\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--Xylol is used in preference to chloroform to dissolve\r\n     Canada balsam, as it does not decolourise the specimen.\r\n\r\n~Impression films~ (_Klatschpraeparat_) are prepared from isolated\r\ncolonies of bacteria in order that their characteristic formation may be\r\nexamined by higher powers than can be brought to bear on the living\r\ncultivation. They are prepared from plate cultivations (_vide_ page 230)\r\nin the following manner.\r\n\r\n1. Remove a clean cover-slip from the alcohol pot with sterile forceps\r\nand burn off the spirit.\r\n\r\n2. Open the plate and rest one edge of the cover-slip on the surface of\r\nthe medium a little to one side of the selected colony. Lower it\r\ncautiously over the colony until horizontal. Avoid any lateral movement\r\nor the inclusion of bubbles of air.\r\n\r\n3. Make gentle vertical pressure on the centre of the cover-slip with\r\nthe points of the forceps to ensure perfect contact with the colony.\r\n\r\n4. Steady one edge of the cover-slip with the forceps and pass the point\r\nof a mounted needle just under the opposite edge and raise the\r\ncover-slip carefully; the colony will be adherent to it. When nearly\r\nvertical, grasp the cover-slip with the forceps and remove it from the\r\nplate. Re-cover the plate.\r\n\r\n5. Place the cover-slip, film uppermost, on the rubber mat, and cover\r\nit with an inverted watch-glass until dry.\r\n\r\n6. Fix by immersing in one of the fixing fluids previously mentioned\r\n(_vide_ page 82).\r\n\r\n7. Clear with acetic acid and alcohol.\r\n\r\n8. Stain and mount as an ordinary cover-slip film preparation, being\r\ncareful to perform all washing operations with extreme gentleness.\r\n\r\n~Microscopical Examination of the Unstained Specimens.~--\r\n\r\n1. Place the body tube of the microscope in the vertical position.\r\n\r\n2. Arrange the hanging-drop slide on the microscope stage so that the\r\ndrop of fluid is in the optical axis of the instrument, and secure it in\r\nthat position by means of the spring clips.\r\n\r\n3. Use the 1/6-inch objective, rack down the body tube until the front\r\nlens of the objective is almost in contact with the cover-slip--that is,\r\nwell within its focal distance. This is best done whilst bending down\r\nthe head to one side of the microscope, so that the eyes are on a level\r\nwith the stage.\r\n\r\n4. Apply the eye to the ocular and adjust the plane mirror to the\r\nposition which secures the best illumination.\r\n\r\n5. Rack the condenser down slightly and cut down the aperture of the\r\niris diaphragm so that the light, although even, is dim.\r\n\r\n6. Rack up the body tube by means of the coarse adjustment until the\r\nbacteria come into view; then focus exactly by means of the fine\r\nadjustment.\r\n\r\nSome difficulty is often experienced at first in finding the hanging\r\ndrop, and if the first attempt is unsuccessful, the student must not on\r\nany account, whilst still applying his eye to the ocular, rack the body\r\ntube down (for by so doing there is every likelihood of the front lens\r\nof the objective being forced through the cover-glass, and not only\r\nspoiling the specimen, but also contaminating the objective); but, on\r\nthe contrary, withdraw his eye, rack the tube up, and commence again\r\nfrom step 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Dark Ground Illumination.~--\r\n\r\n1. Set up the microscope stand in the vertical position and insert the\r\nhighest eyepiece available.\r\n\r\n2. Remove the nosepiece from the microscope tube and fit the 2/3 inch\r\nobjective in place.\r\n\r\n3. Remove the substage condenser and replace it by the dark ground\r\ncondenser.\r\n\r\n4. Fit up the source of illumination some 30-50 cm. distant from the\r\nmicroscope. (This should be the Liliput Arc Lamp (Leitz), Nernst Lamp or\r\nincandescent gas lamp; if either of the two latter are employed, a\r\nbull's eye condenser to produce parallel rays must be interposed between\r\nlight and microscope); and adjust illuminant and microscope so that the\r\nsubstage plane mirror is completely filled with light.\r\n\r\n5. Focus the two concentric rings engraved upon the upper surface of the\r\ncondenser and centre them accurately by means of the centring screws.\r\n\r\n6. Prepare a \"fresh\" specimen (see pages 74-76) of the material it is\r\ndesired to observe, using selected, new, 3 by 1 glass slips of less than\r\n1 mm. thickness, and No. 1 cover-glasses (0.17 mm. thick), which should\r\nbe cleaned with a piece of soft washleather and not with the emery\r\npaper, as scratches on the glass produce haziness in the preparation.\r\n\r\n7. Deposit a large drop of immersion oil (or pure water) on the upper\r\nsurface of the condenser and rack it down a few millimetres.\r\n\r\n8. Adjust the fresh preparation on the microscope stage and fasten it in\r\nposition with the stage clips.\r\n\r\n9. Rack up the condenser until the immersion fluid makes contact with\r\nthe under surface of the slide; avoid the formation of air bubbles.\r\n\r\n10. Adjust the substage mirror so that the light is reflected upward. A\r\nbright spot will be seen on the fresh preparation near the centre of the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\n11. Replace the 2/3-inch objective by the 1/12-inch oil immersion lens\r\nwhich has been fitted with the special stop to reduce its N. A.; place a\r\ndrop of immersion oil upon the centre of the cover-glasses of the fresh\r\npreparation and lower the microscope tube until the front lens of the\r\nobjective has entered the oil drop.\r\n\r\n12. Focus the bright spot referred to in step 10. If it no longer\r\noccupies the centre of the field, alter the angle of the substage mirror\r\nuntil it does.\r\n\r\n13. Now focus the lens accurately on the film, cautiously vary the\r\nheight of the dark ground condenser until the best position is found.\r\nThe intensely illuminated bacteria will stand out in vivid contrast to\r\nthe dark background.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 70.--Immersion oil bottle.]\r\n\r\n~Microscopical Examination of the Stained Specimen.~--(The body tube of\r\nthe microscope may be vertical or inclined to an angle.)\r\n\r\n1. Secure the slide on the stage of the microscope by means of the\r\nspring clips.\r\n\r\n2. Place a drop of cedarwood oil on the centre of the cover-slip.\r\n\r\n     The immersion oil is pure cedarwood oil, and is kept in a\r\n     small bottle of stout glass (Fig. 70), the cavity of which\r\n     is shaped like an inverted cone, and is provided with a\r\n     safety funnel (so that the oil does not escape if the bottle\r\n     is accidentally overturned) and a dust cap of boxwood fitted\r\n     with a wooden rod with which the drop of oil is applied to\r\n     the cover-glass or lens.\r\n\r\n3. Use the 1/12-inch oil immersion lens of the microscope. Rack down the\r\nbody tube till the front lens of the objective is in contact with the\r\noil and nearly touching the cover-slip.\r\n\r\n4. Rack up the condenser until it is in contact with the under surface\r\nof the slide.\r\n\r\n5. Apply the eye to the ocular and arrange the plane mirror so as to\r\nobtain the greatest possible amount of light.\r\n\r\n6. Rack up the body tube until the stained film comes into view.\r\n\r\n7. Focus the condenser accurately on the film.\r\n\r\n8. Focus the film accurately by means of the fine adjustment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. STAINING METHODS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the following pages are collected the various \"stock\" stains in\r\neveryday use in the bacteriological laboratory, together with a\r\nselection of the most convenient and generally useful staining methods\r\nfor demonstrating particular structures or differentiating groups of\r\nbacteria. The stains employed should either be those prepared by\r\nGruebler, of Leipzig, or Merck, of Darmstadt.

Loeffler's Method.~--\r\n\r\n     (a) _Mordant._--\r\n\r\n    Tannic acid, 20 per cent. aqueous solution     10 c.c.\r\n    Ferrous sulphate, saturated aqueous solution    5 c.c.\r\n    Haematoxylin solution                           3 c.c.\r\n    Carbolic acid, 1 per cent. aqueous solution     4 c.c.\r\n\r\n     This solution must be freshly prepared.\r\n\r\n     _Haematoxylin solution_ is prepared by boiling 1 gramme\r\n     logwood\r\n\r\nwith 8 c.c. distilled water, filtering and replacing the loss from\r\nevaporation.\r\n\r\n    _Alternative Mordant_ (Bunge's Mordant).--\r\n\r\n    Tannic acid, 20 per cent. aqueous solution       10 c.c.\r\n    Ferrous sulphate, saturated aqueous solution      5 c.c.\r\n    Fuchsin, saturated alcoholic solution             1 c.c.\r\n\r\n    (b) _Stain._--\r\n\r\n    Weigh out\r\n        Methylene-blue        }\r\n        Or methylene-violet   } 4 grammes\r\n        Or fuchsin            }\r\n\r\nand dissolve in\r\n\r\n    Aniline water, freshly saturated and filtered     100 c.c.\r\n\r\nMETHOD.--\r\n\r\n1. Prepare and fix films as above.\r\n\r\n2. Pour the mordant on to the film and warm cautiously over the flame\r\ntill steam rises; keep the mordant gently steaming for one minute.\r\n\r\n3. Wash well in distilled water till no more colour is discharged; if\r\nnecessary, wash carefully with absolute alcohol.\r\n\r\n4. Filter a few drops of the stain on to the film, warm as before, and\r\nallow the steaming stain to act for one minute.\r\n\r\n5. Wash well in distilled water.\r\n\r\n6. Dry and mount.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--The flagella of some organisms can be demonstrated better by\r\nmeans of an alkaline stain or an acid stain--a point to be determined\r\nfor each. Speaking generally, those bacilli which give rise to an acid\r\nreaction in the culture medium require an alkali; those which form\r\nalkali in cultivation require an acid. According to requirements,\r\ntherefore, Loeffler recommends the addition of sodium hydrate, 1 per\r\ncent. aqueous solution, 1 c.c.; or an equal quantity of an exactly\r\ncomparable solution of sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\n~5. Van Ermengem's Method.~--This method, being merely a precipitation of\r\na silver salt on the micro-organisms and not a true stain, creates a\r\nfalse impression as to the relative proportions of bacteria and\r\nflagella.\r\n\r\n\r\n    (a) _Fixing Fluid._--\r\n\r\n    Osmic acid, 2 per cent. aqueous solution        10 c.c.\r\n    Tannic acid, 20 per cent. aqueous solution      20 c.c.\r\n    Acetic acid, glacial                             1 c.c.\r\n\r\n     The fixing fluid should be prepared some days before use and\r\n     filtered as required. In colour it should be distinctly\r\n     violet.\r\n\r\n     (b) _Sensitising Solution._--\r\n\r\n     Silver nitrate, 0.5 per cent. aqueous solution.\r\n\r\n     This solution must be kept in a dark blue glass bottle or in\r\n     a dark cupboard.\r\n\r\n     Filter immediately before use.\r\n\r\n     (c) _Reducing Solution._--\r\n\r\n     Weigh out\r\n\r\n    Gallic acid                    5 grammes\r\n    Tannic acid                    3 grammes\r\n    Potassium acetate, fused      10 grammes\r\n\r\n     and dissolve in\r\n\r\n    Distilled water           350 c.c.\r\n\r\n     Filter.\r\n\r\n     This solution will keep active for several days, but fresh\r\n     solution must be used for each preparation.\r\n\r\n     METHOD.--\r\n\r\n     1. Prepare emulsion, make and fix films as above in the\r\n     preceding method, steps 1 to 4.\r\n\r\n     2. Pour on the film as much of the fixing solution as the\r\n     cover-glass will hold, heat carefully over the flame till\r\n     steam rises, and allow the steaming fixing fluid to act for\r\n     five minutes.\r\n\r\n     3. Wash well in water.\r\n\r\n     4. Wash in absolute alcohol.\r\n\r\n     5. Wash in distilled water.\r\n\r\n     6. Pour some of the sensitising solution on the film and\r\n     allow it to act for from thirty seconds to one minute; blot\r\n     off the excess of fluid with filter paper.\r\n\r\n     7. Without washing, transfer the film to a watch-glass\r\n     containing the reducing solution and allow it to remain\r\n     therein for from thirty seconds to one minute; blot off the\r\n     excess of fluid with filter paper.\r\n\r\n     8. Without washing, again treat the film with the\r\n     sensitising solution, this time until the film commences to\r\n     turn black.\r\n\r\n     9. Wash in distilled water.\r\n\r\n     10. Dry and mount.\r\n\r\n~To Stain Nuclei of Yeast Cells.~\r\n\r\n1. Prepare and fix film in the usual manner.\r\n\r\n2. Soak in ferric ammonia sulphate 3 per cent. aqueous solution for two\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n3. Wash thoroughly in water.\r\n\r\n4. Stain in haematoxylin solution (see page 95) for thirty minutes.\r\n\r\n5. Wash in water.\r\n\r\n6. Differentiate in ferric ammonia sulphate solution for 1-1/2-2\r\nminutes, examining wet under microscope during the process.\r\n\r\n\r\n~To Stain Spores.~\r\n\r\n~1. Single Stain.~--\r\n\r\n1. Prepare cover-slip film in the usual way.\r\n\r\n2. In fixing, pass the cover-slip film fifteen or thirty times through\r\nthe flame instead of only three. This destroys the resisting power of\r\nthe spore membrane and allows the stain to reach the interior.\r\n\r\n3. Stain in the usual way with methylene-blue or fuchsin.\r\n\r\n4. Wash in water.\r\n\r\n5. Dry and mount.\r\n\r\n~2. Double Stain.~--\r\n\r\n1. Prepare and fix film in the usual way--i. e., pass three times\r\nthrough flame to fix.\r\n\r\n2. Cover the film with hot carbol-fuchsin and hold in the forceps above\r\na small flame until the fluid begins to steam. Set the cover-slip down\r\nand allow it to cool. Repeat the process when the stain ceases to steam\r\nand continue to repeat until the stain has been in contact with the film\r\nfor twenty minutes. (This stains both spores and bacteria.)\r\n\r\n3. Wash in water.\r\n\r\n4. Decolourise in alcohol, 2 parts; acetic acid, 1 per cent., 1 part.\r\n(This removes the stain from everything but the spores.)\r\n\r\n5. Wash in water.\r\n\r\n6. Mount the cover-slip in water and examine microscopically with the\r\n1/6-inch objective. (Spores should be red, and the rest of the film\r\ncolourless or a very light pink.) If satisfactory, pass on to section 7;\r\nif unsatisfactory, repeat steps 2 to 5.\r\n\r\n7. Counterstain in weak methylene-blue. (Now spores red, bacilli blue.)\r\n\r\n8. Wash in water.\r\n\r\n9. Dry and mount.\r\n\r\nThe spores of different bacilli differ greatly in their resistance to\r\ndecolourising reagents; even the spores of the same species of organisms\r\nvary according to their age. Young spores are more easily decolourised\r\nthan those more mature.\r\n\r\nSulphuric acid, 1 per cent. aqueous solution, and hydrochloric acid, 0.5\r\nper cent. alcoholic (90 per cent.) solution, are useful decolourising\r\nreagents.\r\n\r\n     ~3. Moeller's Method.~--\r\n\r\n     1. Prepare and fix films in the usual manner.\r\n\r\n     2. Immerse in absolute alcohol for two minutes, then in\r\n     chloroform for two minutes; wash in water. This dissolves\r\n     out any fat or crystals that might otherwise retain the\r\n     \"spore\" stain.\r\n\r\n     3. Immerse in chromic acid, 5 per cent. aqueous solution,\r\n     for one minute; wash in water.\r\n\r\n     4. Pour Ziehl's carbolic fuchsin on the film, warm as in\r\n     previous methods, and allow it to act for ten minutes.\r\n\r\n     5. Wash in water.\r\n\r\n     6. Decolourise in sulphuric acid, 5 per cent. aqueous\r\n     solution, for five seconds.\r\n\r\n     7. Wash in water.\r\n\r\n     8. Counterstain with Kuehne's carbolic methylene-blue for\r\n     one or two minutes.\r\n\r\n     9. Wash in water.\r\n\r\n     10. Dry and mount.\r\n\r\n     (Spores red, bacilli blue.)\r\n\r\n     ~4. Abbott's Method.~--\r\n\r\n     1. Prepare and fix films in the usual manner.\r\n\r\n     2. Pour Loeffler's alkaline methylene-blue on the film; warm\r\n     cautiously over the flame till steam rises and allow the hot\r\n     steam to act for one to five minutes.\r\n\r\n     3. Wash thoroughly in water.\r\n\r\n     4. Decolourise in nitric acid, 2 per cent. alcoholic\r\n     (alcohol 80 per cent.) solution.\r\n\r\n     5. Wash thoroughly in water.\r\n\r\n     6. Counterstain in eosin, 1 per cent. aqueous solution.\r\n\r\n     7. Wash.\r\n\r\n     8. Dry and mount.\r\n\r\n     (Spores blue, bacilli red.)\r\n\r\n\r\nDIFFERENTIAL METHODS OF STAINING.\r\n\r\n~Gram's Method.~--This method depends upon the fact that the protoplasm of\r\nsome bacteria permits aniline gentian violet and Lugol's iodine\r\nsolution, when applied consecutively, to enter into a chemical\r\ncombination which results in the formation of a new blue-black pigment,\r\nonly very sparingly soluble in absolute alcohol. Such organisms are said\r\nto \"stain by Gram,\" or to be \"Gram positive.\"\r\n\r\n1. Prepare a cover-slip film and fix in the usual way.\r\n\r\n2. Stain in aniline gentian violet three to five minutes. Filter as much\r\naniline water on to the cover-slip as it will hold; then add the\r\nsmallest quantity of alcoholic solution of gentian violet which suffices\r\nto saturate the aniline water and form a \"bronze scum\" upon its\r\nsurface--if too much of the alcoholic gentian violet is added the\r\nalcohol present redissolves this scum.\r\n\r\n     To prepare aniline water, pour 4 or 5 c.c. aniline oil into\r\n     a stoppered bottle and add distilled water, 100 c.c. Shake\r\n     vigourously and filter immediately before use. The excess of\r\n     oil sinks to the bottom of the bottle and may be used again.\r\n\r\n3. Wash in water.\r\n\r\n4. Treat with Lugol's iodine solution until the film is black or dark\r\nbrown.\r\n\r\nTo do this treat with iodine solution for a few seconds, wash in water,\r\nand examine the film over a piece of white filter paper. Note the\r\ncolour. Repeat this process until the film ceases to darken with the\r\nfresh application of iodine solution.\r\n\r\nLugol's solution is prepared by dissolving\r\n\r\n    Iodine                  1 gramme\r\n    Iodide of potassium     3 grammes\r\n    In distilled water    300 c.c.\r\n\r\n5. Wash in water.\r\n\r\n6. Wash with alcohol until no more colour is discharged and the alcohol\r\nruns away clear and colourless.\r\n\r\nThe following mixture may be substituted for absolute alcohol as a\r\ndecolouriser\r\n\r\n    Acetone             10 c.c.\r\n    Absolute alcohol   100 c.c.\r\n\r\n7. Wash in water.\r\n\r\n8. Counterstain very lightly with aqueous solution of Neutral Red. Other\r\ncounterstains may be used such as dilute eosin, dilute fuchsin, or\r\nvesuvin.\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--This section may be omitted when dealing with films\r\n     prepared from pure cultivations.\r\n\r\n9. Wash in water.\r\n\r\n10. Dry and mount.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Gram-Claudius Method.~--\r\n\r\n1. Prepare a cover-slip film and fix in the usual way.\r\n\r\n2. Stain in methyl violet, 1 per cent. aqueous solution for three to\r\nfive minutes.\r\n\r\n3. Treat with two lots picric acid, saturated aqueous solution.\r\n\r\n4. Wash in water and dry.\r\n\r\n5. Decolourise with clove oil.\r\n\r\n6. Wash off clove oil with xylol.\r\n\r\n7. Mount in xylol balsam.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Gram-Weigert Method.~--\r\n\r\n1-5. Proceed as for the corresponding sections of Gram's method (_quod\r\nvide_).\r\n\r\n6. Dry in the air.\r\n\r\n7. Wash in aniline oil, 1 part, xylol, 2 parts, until no more colour is\r\ndischarged.\r\n\r\n8. Wash in xylol.\r\n\r\n9. Mount in xylol balsam.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Modified Gram-Weigert Method.~--(To demonstrate trichophyta in hair.)\r\n\r\n1. Soak the hairs in ether for ten minutes to remove the fat.\r\n\r\n2. Stain thirty minutes in a tar-like solution of aniline gentian violet\r\n(prepared by adding 15 drops of the alcoholic solution of gentian violet\r\nto 3 drops of aniline water).\r\n\r\n3. Dry the hairs between pieces of blotting paper.\r\n\r\n4. Treat with perfectly fresh iodine solution.\r\n\r\n5. Again dry between blotting paper.\r\n\r\n6. Treat with aniline oil to remove excess of stain. (If necessary, add\r\na drop or two of nitric acid to the oil.)\r\n\r\n7. Again treat with aniline oil.\r\n\r\n8. Treat with aniline oil and xylol, equal parts.\r\n\r\n9. Clear with xylol.\r\n\r\n10. Mount in xylol balsam.\r\n\r\nTo obtain the best differentiation the preparation should be repeatedly\r\nexamined microscopically (with a 1/6-inch objective) between steps 5 and\r\n9, as the actual time involved varies with different specimens.\r\n\r\n~Ziehl-Neelsen's Method.~--(To demonstrate tubercle and other acid-fast\r\nbacilli.)\r\n\r\n1. Smear a thin, even film of the specimen on the cover-slip by means of\r\nthe platinum loop. (In the case of sputum, if it is a very watery\r\nspecimen, allow the film to dry, then spread a second and even a third\r\nlayer over the first.)\r\n\r\n2. Fix by passing three times through the flame.\r\n\r\n3. Stain in hot carbol-fuchsin (as in staining for spores) for five to\r\nten minutes. (This stains everything on the film.) Avoid over-heating.\r\n\r\n4. Decolourise by dipping in sulphuric acid, 25 per cent. (This removes\r\nstain from everything but acid-fast bacilli; e. g., tubercle, leprosy,\r\nand smegma bacilli and the film turns yellow.)\r\n\r\n5. Wash in water. (A pale red colour returns to the film).\r\n\r\n6. Wash in alcohol till no more colour is discharged. (This often, but\r\nnot invariably, removes the stain from acid-fast bacilli other than\r\ntubercle; e. g., smegma bacillus.)\r\n\r\n7. Wash in water.\r\n\r\n8. Counterstain in weak methylene-blue. (Stains non-acid-fast bacilli,\r\nleucocytes, epithelial cells, etc.)\r\n\r\n9. Wash in water, dry, and mount.\r\n\r\n~Pappenheim's Method.~--\r\n\r\nThis method is supposed to differentiate between B. tuberculosis and\r\nother acid-fast micro-organisms.\r\n\r\n1. Prepare and fix film in the usual way.\r\n\r\n2. Stain in carbol-fuchsin _without heat_ for three minutes.\r\n\r\n3. Without previously washing in water treat the film with three or four\r\nsuccessive applications of corallin (Rosolic acid) solution.\r\n\r\n    Corallin                             1 gramme\r\n    Methylene-blue\r\n    (saturated alcoholic solution)     100 c.c.\r\n    Glycerine                           20 c.c.\r\n\r\n4. Wash in water.\r\n\r\n5. Dry and mount.\r\n\r\n~Neisser's Method--Modified.~--(To demonstrate diphtheroid bacilli.)\r\n\r\n_Stain I._--\r\n\r\nMeasure out and mix\r\n\r\n    Methylene-blue, saturated alcoholic solution     4.0 c.c.\r\n    Acetic acid, 5 per cent. aqueous solution       96.0 c.c.\r\n\r\nFilter.\r\n\r\n_Stain II._--\r\n\r\nWeigh out\r\n\r\n    Neutral red                2.5 grammes\r\n\r\nand dissolve in\r\n\r\n    Distilled water              1000 c.c.\r\n\r\nFilter.\r\n\r\nMETHOD.--\r\n\r\n1. Prepare and fix films in the usual way.\r\n\r\n2. Pour stain I on the film and allow it to act for two minutes.\r\n\r\n3. Wash thoroughly in water.\r\n\r\n4. Treat with Lugol's iodine for ten seconds.\r\n\r\n5. Wash thoroughly in water.\r\n\r\n6. Pour stain II on to the film and allow it to act for thirty seconds.\r\n\r\n7. Wash thoroughly in water.\r\n\r\n8. Dry and mount.\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--The cultivation from which the films are prepared\r\n     must be upon blood-serum which has been incubated at 37 deg. C.\r\n     for from nine to eighteen hours.\r\n\r\nThe bacilli are stained a light red by the neutral red, which contrasts\r\nwell with the two or three black spots, situated at the poles and\r\noccasionally one in the centre representing protoplasmic aggregations (?\r\nmetachromatic granules) stained by the acid methylene-blue.\r\n\r\n     ~Wheal and Chown (Oxford) Method.~--(To demonstrate\r\n     actinomyces.)\r\n\r\n     1. Stain briefly with Ehrlich's haematoxylin (until nuclei\r\n     are faint blue after washing with tap water).\r\n\r\n     2. Wash in tap water.\r\n\r\n     3. Stain in hot carbol-fuchsin (as for tubercle bacilli) for\r\n     five to ten minutes.\r\n\r\n     4. Wash in tap water.\r\n\r\n     5. Decolourise with Spengler's picric acid alcohol. This is\r\n     prepared by mixing:\r\n\r\n        Alcohol, absolute                          20 c.c.\r\n        Picric acid, saturated aqueous solution    10 c.c.\r\n        Distilled water                            10 c.c.\r\n\r\n     During the progress of steps 1-5 the preparation must be\r\n     repeatedly examined microscopically with the 1/6-inch\r\n     objective.\r\n\r\n     When properly differentiated the clubs appear brilliant red\r\n     on greenish ground.\r\n\r\n     6. Dehydrate in alcohol.\r\n\r\n     7. Clear in xylol.\r\n\r\n     8. Mount in xylol balsam.\r\n\r\n     This method serves equally well for films and for sections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. METHODS OF DEMONSTRATING BACTERIA IN TISSUES.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor bacteriological purposes, sections of tissue are most conveniently\r\nprepared by either the ~freezing method~ or the ~paraffin method~.\r\n\r\nThe latter is decidedly preferable, but as it is of greater importance\r\nto demonstrate the bacteria, if such are present, than to preserve the\r\ntissue elements unaltered, the \"frozen\" sections are often of value.\r\n\r\nWhichever method is selected, it is necessary to take small pieces of\r\nthe tissue for sectioning,--2 to 5 mm. cubes when possible, but in any\r\ncase not exceeding half a centimetre in thickness. Post-mortem material\r\nshould be secured as soon after the death of the animal as possible.\r\n\r\nThe tissue is prepared for cutting by--\r\n\r\n(a) Fixation; that is, by causing the death of the cellular elements\r\nin such a manner that they retain their characteristic shape and form.\r\n\r\nThe fixing fluids in general use are: Absolute alcohol; corrosive\r\nsublimate, saturated aqueous solution; corrosive sublimate, Lang's\r\nsolution (_vide_ page 82); formaldehyde, 4 per cent. aqueous solution.\r\n(Of these, Lang's corrosive sublimate solution is decidedly the best\r\nall-round \"fixative.\")\r\n\r\n(b) Hardening; that is, by rendering the tissue of sufficient\r\nconsistency to admit of thin slices or \"sections\" being cut from it.\r\nThis is effected by passing the tissue successively through alcohols of\r\ngradually increasing strength: 30 per cent. alcohol, 50 per cent.\r\nalcohol, 75 per cent. alcohol, 90 per cent. alcohol, absolute alcohol.\r\n\r\nIn both these processes a large excess of fluid should always be used.\r\n\r\n\r\nFREEZING METHOD.\r\n\r\n1. ~Fixation.~ Place the pieces of tissue in a wide-mouthed glass bottle\r\nand fill with absolute alcohol. Allow the tissues to remain therein for\r\ntwenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n2. ~Hardening.~ Remove the alcohol (no longer absolute, as it has taken up\r\nwater from the tissues) from the bottle and replace it with fresh\r\nabsolute alcohol. Allow the tissues to remain therein for twenty-four\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 71.--Washing tissues.]\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--If not needed for cutting immediately, the hardened\r\n     tissues can be stored in 75 per cent. alcohol.\r\n\r\n3. Remove the alcohol from the tissues by soaking in water from one to\r\ntwo hours. Remove the stopper from the bottle; rest a glass funnel in\r\nthe open mouth and place under a tap of running water. The water of\r\ncourse, overflows, but the tissues remain in the bottle (Fig. 71).\r\n\r\n4. Impregnate the tissues with mucilage for twelve to twenty-four hours,\r\naccording to size. Transfer the pieces of tissue to a bottle containing\r\nsterilised gum mixture.\r\n\r\n~Formula.~--\r\n\r\n    Gum arabic      5 grammes\r\n    Saccharose      1 gramme\r\n    Boric acid      1 gramme\r\n    Water         100 c.c.\r\n\r\n5. Place the tissue on the plate of a freezing microtome (Cathcart's is\r\nperhaps the best form), cover and surround with fresh gum mixture;\r\nfreeze with ether, or for preference, carbon dioxide, and cut sections.\r\n\r\n6. Float the sections off the knife into a glass dish containing tepid\r\nwater and allow them to remain therein for about an hour to dissolve out\r\nthe gum.\r\n\r\n(If not required at once, store in 90 per cent. alcohol.)\r\n\r\n7. Transfer to a glass capsule containing the selected staining fluid,\r\nby means of a section lifter.\r\n\r\n8. Transfer the sections in turn to a capsule containing absolute\r\nalcohol (to dehydrate) and to one containing xylol or oil of cloves (to\r\nclear).\r\n\r\n9. Mount in xylol balsam.\r\n\r\n_Alternative Rapid Method._--\r\n\r\n     1. Cut very small blocks of the tissue.\r\n\r\n     2. Fix in formalin 10 per cent. aqueous solution (fixation\r\n     fluid No. 7, page 82) for 24 hours.\r\n\r\n     3. Transfer block to plate of freezing microtome and freeze\r\n     with carbon dioxide vapour.\r\n\r\n     4. Float the sections off the knife into a glass dish of\r\n     tepid water.\r\n\r\n     5. Stain the sections in glass capsules containing selected\r\n     stains.\r\n\r\n     6. Place the stained section in a dish of clean water and\r\n     introduce a glass slide obliquely beneath the section; with\r\n     a mounted needle draw the section on to the slide and hold\r\n     it there; gently remove the slide from the water, taking\r\n     care that any folds in the section are floated out before\r\n     the slide is finally removed from the water.\r\n\r\n     7. Drain away as much water as possible from the section.\r\n     Drop absolute alcohol on to the section from a drop bottle,\r\n     to dehydrate it.\r\n\r\n     8. Double a piece of blotting paper and gently press it on\r\n     the section to dry it.\r\n\r\n     9. Drop on xylol to clear the section.\r\n\r\n     10. Place a large drop of xylol balsam on the section and\r\n     carefully lower a cover-glass on to the balsam.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARAFFIN METHOD.\r\n\r\n1. ~Fixation.~ Place the pieces of tissue, resting on cotton-wool, in a\r\nwide-mouthed glass bottle. Pour on a sufficient quantity of the\r\ncorrosive sublimate fixing fluid; allow the tissue to remain therein for\r\ntwelve to twenty-four hours according to size.\r\n\r\n2. Pour off the fixing fluid and wash thoroughly in running water for\r\ntwenty minutes to half an hour to remove the excess of corrosive\r\nsublimate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 72.--~L~-shaped brass moulds.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 73.--Paraffin kettle.]\r\n\r\n3. ~Hardening.~ Place the tissues in each of the following strengths of\r\nalcohol in turn for from twelve to twenty-four hours: 50 per cent., 75\r\nper cent., 90 per cent., absolute.\r\n\r\n4. ~Dehydration~ is effected by transferring the tissues to fresh absolute\r\nalcohol.\r\n\r\n5. ~Clearing.~ Half fill a wide-mouthed bottle with chloroform. On the\r\nsurface of the chloroform float a layer of absolute alcohol about five\r\nto ten millimetres in depth. Place the pieces of tissue in the layer of\r\nalcohol and when they have sunk through this layer, transfer them to\r\npure chloroform for from six to twenty-four hours according to the size\r\nof the pieces. When \"cleared,\" the tissue becomes more or less\r\ntransparent.\r\n\r\n6. ~Infiltration.~ Place the cleared tissues in fresh chloroform with\r\nseveral pieces of paraffin wax and stand in a warm place, such as on the\r\ntop of the warm incubator. The warmth gradually melts the paraffin and\r\nthe tissues should remain in the mixture about twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n7. Transfer the tissues to a vessel containing pure melted paraffin.\r\nPlace this vessel in a paraffin water-bath regulated for 2 deg. C. above\r\nthe melting-point of the paraffin used, and allow the tissues to soak for\r\nsome four to six hours to ensure complete impregnation. The paraffin\r\nused should have a melting-point of not more than 58 deg. C. For all\r\nordinary purposes 54 deg. C. will be found quite high enough.\r\n\r\n8. Imbed in fresh paraffin in a metal (or paper) mould.\r\n\r\n(a) Arrange a pair of ~L~-shaped pieces of metal on a plate of glass to\r\nform a rectangular trough (Fig. 72).\r\n\r\n(b) Pour fresh melted paraffin into the mould from a special vessel\r\n(Fig. 73).\r\n\r\n(c) Lift the piece of tissue from the paraffin bath and arrange it in\r\nthe mould.\r\n\r\n(d) Blow gently on the surface of the paraffin in the mould, and as\r\nsoon as a film of solid paraffin has formed, carefully lift the glass\r\nplate on which the mould is set and lower plate and mould together into\r\na basin of cold water.\r\n\r\n(e) When the block is cold, break off the metal ~L~'s; trim off the\r\nexcess of paraffin from around the tissue with a knife, taking care to\r\nretain the rectangular shape, and store the block in a pill-box.\r\n\r\nWhen several pieces of tissue have to be imbedded at one time, shapes of\r\nstout copper, 10 cm., 5 cm., and 2.5 cm. square respectively, and 0.75\r\ncm. deep (Fig. 74) will be found extremely useful. These placed upon\r\nplates of glass replace the pair of L's in the above process. When the\r\nparaffin has set firmly the screw a should be loosened to allow the\r\ntwo halves of the flange b to separate slightly--this facilitates\r\nremoval of the paraffin block.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 74.--Paraffin mould.]\r\n\r\n8. Cement the block on the carrier of a \"paraffin\" microtome (the Minot,\r\nthe Jung, or the Cambridge Rocker) with a little melted paraffin.\r\nGreater security is obtained if the paraffin around the base of the\r\nblock is melted by means of a hot metal or glass rod.\r\n\r\n9. Cut sections--thin, and if possible in ribbands.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Mounting Paraffin Sections.~--\r\n\r\n1. Place a large drop of 30 per cent. alcohol on the centre of a slide\r\n(or cover-slip) and float the section on to the surface of the drop,\r\nfrom a section lifter.\r\n\r\n2. Hold the slide in the fingers of one hand and warm cautiously over\r\nthe flame of a Bunsen burner, touching the under surface of the glass\r\nfrom time to time on the back of the other hand. As soon as the slide\r\nfeels distinctly warm to the skin, the paraffin section will flatten out\r\nand all wrinkles disappear.\r\n\r\n(The slide with the section floating on it may be rested on the top of\r\nthe paraffin bath for two or three minutes, instead of warming over the\r\nflame as here described.)\r\n\r\n3. Cautiously tilt up the slide and blot off the excess of spirit with\r\nblotting paper, leaving the section attached to the centre of the\r\nslide.\r\n\r\n4. Place the slide in a wire rack (Fig. 75), section downward, in the\r\n\"hot\" incubator for twelve to twenty-four hours. At the end of this time\r\nthe section is firmly adherent to the glass, and is treated during the\r\nsubsequent steps as a \"fixed\" cover-glass film preparation.\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--If large, thick sections have to be manipulated, or\r\n     if time is of importance or acids are used during the\r\n     staining process, it is often advisable to add a trace of\r\n     Mayer's albumin to the alcohol before floating out the\r\n     section. If this substance is employed, a sojourn of twenty\r\n     minutes to half an hour in the \"hot\" incubator will be found\r\n     ample to ensure firm adhesion of the section to the slide.\r\n     The albuminous fluid is prepared as follows:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 75.--Section rack.]\r\n\r\n\r\n~Mayer's Albumin.~--\r\n\r\n    Weigh out\r\n          Salicylate of soda    1 gramme\r\n    and dissolve in\r\n          Glycerine            50 c.c.\r\n    Add\r\n          White of egg         50 c.c.\r\n\r\n     Mix thoroughly by means of an egg whisk.\r\n\r\n     Filter into a clean bottle.\r\n\r\n     As an alternative method paint a thin layer of Schallibaum's\r\n     solution on the slide with a camel's hair pencil; lay the\r\n     section carefully on this film and heat gently to fix the\r\n     section.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Schallibaum's solution_:\r\n\r\n    Clove oil      30 c.c.\r\n    Collodion      10 c.c.\r\n\r\nKeep in a dark blue bottle in a cool place.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Staining Paraffin Sections.~--\r\n\r\n1. Warm paraffin section over the Bunsen flame to soften (_but not to\r\nmelt_) the paraffin, then dissolve out the wax with xylol poured on from\r\na drop bottle.\r\n\r\n2. Remove xylol by flushing the section with alcohol.\r\n\r\n3. If the tissue was originally \"fixed\" in a corrosive sublimate\r\nsolution, the section must now be treated with Lugol's iodine solution\r\nfor two minutes and subsequently immersed in 90 per cent. alcohol to\r\nremove all traces of yellow staining.\r\n\r\n4. Wash in water.\r\n\r\n5. Stain deeply, if using a single stain, as the subsequent processes\r\ndecolourise.\r\n\r\n6. Wash in water, decolourise if necessary.\r\n\r\n7. Flood with several changes of absolute alcohol to dehydrate the\r\nsection.\r\n\r\n8. Clear in xylol. (Oil of cloves is not usually employed, as it\r\ndecolourises the section.)\r\n\r\n9. Mount in xylol balsam.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL STAINING METHODS FOR SECTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Double-staining Carmine and Gram-Weigert.~--\r\n\r\n1.

CLASSIFICATION OF FUNGI.~\r\n\r\n\r\nFor practical purposes FUNGI may be divided into:\r\n\r\n    ~1. Hymenomycetes~ (including the mushrooms, etc.).\r\n    ~2. Hyphomycetes~ (moulds).\r\n    ~3. Blastomycetes~ (yeasts and torulae).\r\n    ~4. Schizomycetes~ (bacteria).\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--Formerly myxomycetes were included in the fungi; they\r\n     are now recognized as belonging to the animal kingdom, and\r\n     are termed \"mycetozoa.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n~MORPHOLOGY OF THE HYPHOMYCETES.~\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of his studies, the attention of the student is\r\ndirected to the various non-pathogenic moulds and yeasts, not only that\r\nhe may gain the necessary technique whilst handling cultivations of\r\nharmless organisms, but also because these very species are amongst the\r\ncommonest of those that may accidentally contaminate his future\r\npreparations.\r\n\r\nThe hyphomycetes are composed of a mycelium of short jointed rods or\r\n\"hyphae\" springing from an axis or germinal tube which develops from the\r\nspore. Hyphae are--\r\n\r\n(a) Nutritive or submerged.\r\n\r\n(b) Reproductive or aerial.\r\n\r\nThe protoplasm of these cells contains granules, pigment, oil globules,\r\nand sometimes crystals of calcium oxalate.\r\n\r\n~Reproduction.~--Apical spore formation--asexual;\r\n                               zoospores--sexual.\r\n\r\n~Mucorinae.~--_Mucor_ (Fig. 77).--Note the branching filaments--\"mycelium\"\r\n(a), \"hyphae\" (b).\r\n\r\nNote the asexual reproduction.\r\n\r\n1. A filament grows upward. At its apex a septum forms, then a globular\r\nswelling appears--\"sporagium\" (d). This possesses a definite membrane.\r\n\r\n2. From the septum grows a club-shaped mass of protoplasm--\"columella\"\r\n(c).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 77.--Mucor mucedo.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 78.--Aspergillus]\r\n\r\n3. The rest of the contained protoplasm breaks up into \"swarm spores\"\r\n(e).\r\n\r\nFinally the membrane ruptures and spores escape.\r\n\r\n~Perisporaceae.~--_Aspergillus_ (Fig. 78).--Note the branching\r\nfilaments--\"mycelium\" (a).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 79.--Penicillium.]\r\n\r\nNote the asexual reproduction.\r\n\r\n1. A filament (b) grows upward, its termination becomes clubbed; on\r\nthe clubbed extremity flask-shaped cells appear--\"sterigmata\" (c).\r\n\r\n2. At free end of each sterigma is formed an oval body--a spore or\r\n\"gonidium\" (d), which, when ripe, is thrown off from the sterigma. Two\r\nor more gonidia may be supported upon each sterigma.\r\n\r\n_Penicillium_ (Fig. 79).--Note the branching filaments--\"mycelium\" (a)\r\n(frequently containing globules).\r\n\r\nNote the asexual reproduction.\r\n\r\n1. A filament grows upward--\"goniodophore\" (b)--and its apex divides\r\nup into several branches--\"basidia\" (c).\r\n\r\n2. At the apex of each basidium a flask-shaped cell, \"sterigma\" (d),\r\nappears.\r\n\r\n3. At the apex of each sterigma appears a row of oval cells--\"spores\" or\r\n\"conidia\" (e). These, when ripe, are cast off from the sterigmata.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 80.--Oidium.]\r\n\r\n~Ascomycetae.~--_Oidium_ (Fig. 80).--(This family is perhaps as nearly\r\nrelated to the blastomycetes as it is to the hyphomycetes.)\r\n\r\nNote the branching filaments--\"pseudomycelium\" (a). Here and there\r\nfilaments are broken up at their ends into oval or rod-shaped segments,\r\n\"oidia,\" and behave as spores.\r\n\r\nNote the asexual reproduction. From the pseudomycelium arise true hyphae\r\n(b), each of which in turn ends in a chain of spores (c).\r\n\r\n\r\n~MORPHOLOGY OF THE BLASTOMYCETES.~\r\n\r\nThe blastomycetes are composed of spherical or oval cells (8 to 9.5 mu in\r\ndiameter), which, when rapidly multiplying by budding, may form a\r\nspurious mycelium. A thin cell-wall encloses the granular protoplasm, in\r\nwhich vacuoles and sometimes a nucleus may be noted. This latter is best\r\nseen when stained with haematoxylin (see page 105).\r\n\r\nDuring their growth and multiplication the blastomycetes split up\r\nsolutions containing sugar into alcohol and CO_{2}.\r\n\r\n~Saccharomyces~ (Fig. 81).--Note the round or oval cells of granular\r\nprotoplasm (a) containing solid particles and vacuoles (c), and\r\nsurrounded by a definite envelope.\r\n\r\n~Reproduction.~--Budding; ascospores--asexual.\r\n\r\nNote the asexual _reproduction_.\r\n\r\n1. \"Gemmation\"--that is, the budding out of daughter cells (b) from\r\nvarious parts of the gradually enlarging mother cell. These are\r\neventually cast off and in turn become mother cells and form fresh\r\ngroups of buds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 81.--Saccharomyces with ascospores.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 82.--Torula.]\r\n\r\n2. Spore formation--\"ascospores\" (e). These are formed at definite\r\ntemperatures and within well-defined periods; e. g., Saccharomyces\r\ncerevisiae, thirty hours at 25 deg. to 37 deg. C., or ten days at\r\n12 deg. C.\r\n\r\n~Torulae~ (Fig. 82).--Torulae, whilst resembling yeasts in almost\r\nevery other respect, never form endo-spores. Note the elongated,\r\nsausage-shaped cells (a) the larger oval cells (b) and the globular\r\ncells (c) the former two often interlacing and growing as a film.\r\n\r\nNote the absence of ascospore formation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. SCHIZOMYCETES.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Classification and Morphology.~--Bacteria are often classified, in\r\ngeneral terms, according to their life functions, into--\r\n\r\n    _Saprogenic_, or putrefactive bacteria;\r\n    _Zymogenic_, or fermentative bacteria;\r\n    _Pathogenic_, or disease-producing bacteria;\r\n\r\nor according to their food requirements into--\r\n\r\n    _Prototrophic_, requiring no organic food (e. g., nitrifying bacteria);\r\n    _Metatrophic_, requiring organic food (e. g., saprophytes\r\n         and facultative parasites);\r\n    _Paratrophic_, requiring living food (obligate parasites);\r\n\r\nor according to their metabolic products into--\r\n\r\n    _Chromogenic_, or pigment-producing bacteria;\r\n    _Photogenic_, or light-producing bacteria;\r\n    _Aerogenic_, or gas-producing bacteria;\r\n\r\nand so on.\r\n\r\nSuch broad groupings as these have, however, but little practical value\r\nwhen applied to the systematic study of the fission fungi.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, no really scientific classification of the\r\nschizomycetes has yet been drawn up, and the varying morphological\r\nappearances of the members of the family are still utilised as a basis\r\nfor classification, as under--\r\n\r\n~1. Cocci.~ (Fig. 83).--Rounded or oval cells, subdivided according to the\r\narrangement of the individuals after fission, into--\r\n\r\n_Diplococci_ and _Streptococci_, where division takes place in one plane\r\nonly, and the individuals remain attached (a) in pairs or (b) in\r\nchains.\r\n\r\n_Tetrads_, _Merismopedia_, or _Pediococci_, where division takes place\r\nalternately in two planes at right angles to each other, and the\r\nindividuals remain attached in flat tablets of four, or its multiples.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 83.--Types of bacteria--cocci: 1, Diagram of sphere\r\nindicating planes of fission; 2, diplococci; 3, streptococci; 4,\r\ntetrads; 5, sarcinae; 6, staphylococci.]\r\n\r\n_Sarcinae_, where division takes place in three planes successively,\r\nand the individuals remain attached in cubical packets of eight and its\r\nmultiples.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 84.--Types of bacteria--bacilli, etc.: 1, Bacilli;\r\n2, diplobacilli; 3 streptobacilli; 4, spirilla; 5, vibrios; 6,\r\nspirochaetae.]\r\n\r\n_Micrococci_ or _Staphylococci_, where division takes place in three\r\nplanes, but with no definite sequence; consequently the individuals\r\nremain attached in pairs, short chains, plates of four, cubical packets\r\nof eight, and irregular masses containing numerous cocci.\r\n\r\n~2. Bacilli~ (Fig. 84, 1 to 3).--Rod-shaped cells. A bacillus, however\r\nshort, can usually be distinguished from a coccus in that two sides are\r\nparallel. Some bacilli after fission retain a characteristic arrangement\r\nand may be spoken of as _Diplobacilli_ or _Streptobacilli_.\r\n\r\nLeptothrix is a term that in the past has been loosely used to signify a\r\nlong thread, but is now restricted to such forms as belong to the\r\nleptothriciae (_vide infra_).\r\n\r\n~3. Spirilla~ (Fig. 84, 4 to 6).--Curved and twisted filaments.\r\nClassified, according to shape, into--\r\n\r\n    Spirillum.\r\n    Vibrio (comma).\r\n    Spirochaeta.\r\n\r\nMany Spirochaetes appear to belong to the animal kingdom and are grouped\r\nunder protozoa; other organisms to which this name has been given are\r\nundoubtedly bacteria.\r\n\r\nHigher forms of bacteria are also met with, which possess the following\r\ncharacteristics: They are attached, unbranched, filamentous forms,\r\nshowing--\r\n\r\n(a) Differentiation between base and apex;\r\n\r\n(b) Growth apparently apical;\r\n\r\n(c) Exaggerated pleomorphism;\r\n\r\n(d) \"Pseudo-branching\" from apposition of cells; and are classified\r\ninto--\r\n\r\n    1. Beggiotoa.    }   Free swimming forms, which\r\n    2. Thiothrix.    }   contain sulphur granules.\r\n\r\n    3. Crenothrix.   }\r\n    4. Cladothrix.   }  These forms do not contain\r\n    5. Leptothrix.   }  sulphur granules.\r\n\r\n    6. Streptothrix. A group which exhibits true but\r\n    not dichotomous branching, and contains some pathogenic\r\n    species.\r\n\r\nThe morphology of the same bacterium may vary greatly under different\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nFor example, under one set of conditions the examination of a pure\r\ncultivation of a bacillus may show a short oval rod as the predominant\r\nform, whilst another culture of the same bacillus, but grown under\r\ndifferent conditions, may consist almost entirely of long filaments or\r\nthreads. This variation in morphology is known as \"pleomorphism.\"\r\n\r\nSome of the factors influencing pleomorphism are:\r\n\r\n1. The composition, reaction, etc., of the _nutrient medium_ in which\r\nthe organism is growing.\r\n\r\n2. _The atmosphere_ in which it is cultivated.\r\n\r\n3. _The temperature_ at which it is incubated.\r\n\r\n4. Exposure to or protection from _light_.\r\n\r\nThe various points in the anatomy morphology and physiology of bacteria\r\nupon which stress is laid in the following pages should be studied as\r\nclosely as is possible in preparations of the micro-organisms named in\r\nconnection with each.\r\n\r\n\r\n~ANATOMY.~\r\n\r\n1. _Capsule_ (Fig. 85, b).--A gelatinous envelope (probably akin to\r\nmucin in composition) surrounding each individual organism, and\r\npreventing absolute contact between any two. In some species the capsule\r\n(e. g., B. pneumoniae) is well marked, but it cannot be demonstrated in\r\nall. In very well marked cases of gelatinisation of the cell wall, the\r\nindividual cells are cemented together in a coherent mass, to which the\r\nterm \"zoogloea\" is applied (e. g., Streptococcus mesenteroides). In\r\nsome species colouring matter or ferric oxide is stored in the capsule.\r\n\r\n2. _Cell Wall_ (Fig. 85, c).--A protective differentiation of the\r\nouter layer of the cell protoplasm; difficult to demonstrate, but\r\ntreatment with iodine or salt solution sometimes causes shrinkage of the\r\ncell contents--\"plasmolysis\"--and so renders the cell wall apparent (_e.\r\ng._, B. megatherium) in the manner shown in figure 85. Stained bacilli,\r\nwhen examined with the polarising microscope, often show a doubly\r\nrefractile cell wall (e. g., B. tuberculosis and B. anthracis).\r\n\r\nIn some of the higher bacteria the cell wall exhibits this\r\ndifferentiation to a marked degree and forms a hard sheath within which\r\nthe cell protoplasm is freely movable; and during the process of\r\nreproduction the cell protoplasm may be extruded, leaving the empty tube\r\nunaltered in shape.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 85.--Dragrammatic sketch of composite bacterium to\r\nillustrate details of anatomical structure.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 86.--Plasmolysis.]\r\n\r\n3. _Cell Contents._--Protoplasm (mycoprotein) contains a high percentage\r\nof nitrogen, but is said to differ from proteid in that it is not\r\nprecipitated by C_{2}H_{6}O. It is usually homogeneous in\r\nappearance--sometimes granular--and may contain oil globules or sap\r\nvacuoles (Fig. 85, d), chromatin granules, and even sulphur granules.\r\nSap vacuoles must be distinguished from spores, on the one hand, and the\r\nvacuolated appearance due to plasmolysis, on the other.\r\n\r\nThe cell contents may sometimes be differentiated into a parietal layer,\r\nand a central body (e. g., beggiotoa) when stained by haematoxylin.\r\n\r\n4. _Nucleus._--This structure has not been conclusively proved to\r\nexist, but in some bacteria chromatin particles have been observed near\r\nthe centre of the bacterial cell and denser masses of protoplasm\r\nsituated at the poles which exhibit a more marked affinity than the rest\r\nof the cell protoplasm for aniline dyes. These latter are termed polar\r\ngranules or _Polkoerner_ (Fig. 85, e). Occasionally these aggregations\r\nof protoplasm alter the colour of the dye they take up. They are then\r\nknown as metachromatic bodies or _Ernstschen Koerner_ (e. g., B.\r\ndiphtheriae).\r\n\r\n5. _Flagella_ (Organs of Locomotion, Fig. 85, a).--These are\r\ngelatinous elongations of the cell protoplasm (or more probably of the\r\ncapsule), occurring either at one pole, at both poles, or scattered\r\naround the entire periphery. Flagella are not pseudopodia. The\r\npossession of flagella was at one time suggested as a basis for a system\r\nof classification, when the following types of ciliation were\r\ndifferentiated (Fig. 87):\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 87.--Types of ciliation.]\r\n\r\n1. Polar: (a) _Monotrichous_ (a single flagellum situated at one pole;\r\ne. g., B. pyocyaneus).\r\n\r\n(b) _Amphitrichous_ (a single flagellum at each pole; e. g.,\r\nSpirillum volutans).\r\n\r\n(c) _Lophotrichous_ (a tuft or bunch of flagella situated at each\r\npole; e. g., B. cyanogenus).\r\n\r\n2. Diffuse: _Peritrichous_ (flagella scattered around the entire\r\nperiphery e. g., B. typhosus).\r\n\r\n\r\n~PHYSIOLOGY.~\r\n\r\n~Reproduction.~--_Active Stage._--Vegetative, i. e., by the division of\r\ncells, or \"fission.\"\r\n\r\n1. The cell becomes elongated and the protoplasm aggregated at opposite\r\npoles.\r\n\r\n2. A circular constriction of the organism takes place midway between\r\nthese aggregations, and a septum is formed in the interior of the cell\r\nat right angles to its length.\r\n\r\n3. The division deepens, the septum divides into two lamellae, and\r\nfinally two cells are formed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 88.--Fission of cocci.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 89.--Fission of bacteria.]\r\n\r\n4. The daughter cells may remain united by the gelatinous envelope for a\r\nvariable time. Eventually they separate and themselves subdivide.\r\n\r\nCultures on artificial media, after growing in the same medium for some\r\ntime--i. e., when the pabulum is exhausted--show \"involution forms\"\r\n(Fig. 90), well exemplified in cultures of B. pestis on agar two days\r\nold, B. diphtheriae on potato four to six days old.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 90.--Involution forms.]\r\n\r\nThey are of two classes, viz.:\r\n\r\n(a) Involution forms characterised by alterations of shape (Fig. 90).\r\n(Not necessarily dead.)\r\n\r\n(b) Involution forms characterised by loss of staining power. (Always\r\ndead.)\r\n\r\n_Resting Stage._--Spore Formation.--Conditions influencing spore\r\nformation: In an old culture nothing may be left but spores. It used to\r\nbe supposed that spores were _always_ formed, so that the species might\r\nnot become extinct, when\r\n\r\n(a) The supply of nutrient was exhausted.\r\n\r\n(b) The medium became toxic from the accumulation of metabolic\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\n(c) The environment became unfavourable; e. g., change of\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nThis is not altogether correct; e. g., the temperature at which spores\r\nare best formed is constant for each bacterium, but varies with\r\ndifferent species; again, aerobes require oxygen for sporulation, but\r\nanaerobes will not spore in its presence.\r\n\r\n(A) Arthrogenous: Noted only in the micrococci. One complete element\r\nresulting from ordinary fission becomes differentiated for the purpose,\r\nenlarges, and develops a dense cell wall. One or more of the cells in a\r\nseries may undergo this alteration.\r\n\r\nThis process is probably not real spore formation, but merely relative\r\nincrease of resistance. These so-called arthrospores have never been\r\nobserved to \"germinate,\" nor is their resistance very marked, as they\r\nfail to initiate new cultures, after having been exposed to a\r\ntemperature of 80 deg. C. for ten minutes.\r\n\r\n(B) Endogenous: The cell protoplasm becomes differentiated and condensed\r\ninto a spherical or oval mass (very rarely cylindrical). After further\r\ncontraction the outer layers of the mass become still more highly\r\ndifferentiated and form a distinct spore membrane, and the spore itself\r\nis now highly refractile. It has been suggested, and apparently on good\r\ngrounds, that the spore membrane consists of two layers, the exosporium\r\nand the endosporium. Each cell forms one spore only, usually in the\r\nmiddle, occasionally at one end (some exceptions, however, are recorded;\r\ne. g., B. inflatus). The shape of the parent cell may be unaltered, as\r\nin the anthrax bacillus, or altered, as in the tetanus bacillus, and\r\nthese points serve as the basis for a classification of spore-bearing\r\nbacilli, as follows:\r\n\r\n(A) Cell body of the parent bacillus unaltered in shape (Fig. 91, a).\r\n\r\n(B) Cell of the parent bacillus altered in shape.\r\n\r\n1. _Clostridium_ (Fig. 91, b): Rod swollen at the centre and\r\nattenuated at the poles; spindle shape; e. g., B. butyricus.\r\n\r\n2. _Cuneate_ (Fig. 91, c): Rods swollen slightly at one pole and more\r\nor less pointed at the other; wedge-shaped.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 91--Types of spore-bearing bacilli.]\r\n\r\n3. _Clavate_ (Fig. 91, d): Rods swollen at one pole and cylindrical\r\n(unaltered) at the other; keyhole-shaped; e. g., B. chauvei.\r\n\r\n4. _Capitate_ (Fig. 91, e): Rods with a spherical enlargement at one\r\npole; drumstick-shaped; e. g., B. tetani.\r\n\r\nThe endo-spores remain within the parent cell for a variable time (in\r\none case it is stated that germination of the spore occurs within the\r\ninterior of the parent cell--\"endo-germination\"), but are eventually set\r\nfree, as a result of the swelling up and solution of the cell membrane\r\nof the parent bacillus in the surrounding liquid, or of the rupture of\r\nthat membrane. They then present the following characteristics:\r\n\r\n1. Well-formed, dense cell membranes, which renders them extremely\r\ndifficult to stain, but when once stained equally difficult to\r\ndecolourise.\r\n\r\n2. High refractility, which distinguished them from vacuoles.\r\n\r\n3. Higher resistance than the parent organism to such lethal agents as\r\nheat, desiccation, starvation, time, etc., this resistance being due to\r\n\r\n(a) Low water contents of plasma of the spore.\r\n\r\n    (b) Low heat-conducting power  } of the spore\r\n    (c) Low permeability           } membrane.\r\n\r\nThis resistance varies somewhat with the particular species--e. g.,\r\nsome spores may resist boiling for a few minutes--but practically all\r\nare killed if the boiling is continued for ten minutes.\r\n\r\n~Germination.~--When transplanted to suitable media and placed under\r\nfavourable conditions, the spores germinate, usually within twenty-four\r\nto thirty-six hours, and successively undergo the following changes\r\nwhich may be followed in hanging-drop cultures on a warm stage:\r\n\r\n1. Swell up slowly and enlarge, through the absorption of water.\r\n\r\n2. Lose their refrangibility.\r\n\r\n3. At this stage one of three processes (but the particular process is\r\nalways constant for the same species) may be observed:\r\n\r\n(a) The spore grows out into the new bacillus without discarding the\r\nspore membrane (which in this case now becomes the cell membrane); _e.\r\ng._, B. leptosporus.\r\n\r\n(b) It loses its spore membrane by solution; e. g., B. anthracis.\r\n\r\n(c) It loses its spore membrane by rupture.\r\n\r\nIn this process the rupture may be either polar (at one pole only _e.\r\ng._, B. butyricus), or bipolar (e. g., B. sessile), or equatorial;\r\n(e. g., B. subtilis).\r\n\r\nIn those cases where the spore membrane is discarded the cell membrane\r\nof the new bacillus may either be formed from--\r\n\r\n(a) The inner layer of the spore membrane, which has undergone a\r\npreliminary splitting into parietal and visceral layers; e. g., B.\r\nbutyricus.\r\n\r\n(b) The outer layers of the cell protoplasm, which become\r\ndifferentiated for that purpose; e. g., B. megatherium.\r\n\r\nThe new bacillus now increases in size, elongates, and takes on a\r\nvegetative growth--i. e., undergoes fission--the bacilli resulting\r\nfrom which may in their turn give rise to spores.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 92. Simple.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 93. Solution.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 94. Polar.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 95. Bipolar.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 96. Equatorial.]\r\n\r\n\r\n~Food Stuffs.~--1. _Organic Foods._--\r\n\r\n(a) The pure parasites (e. g., B. leprae) will not live outside the\r\nliving body.\r\n\r\n(b) Both saprophytic and facultative parasitic bacteria agree in\r\nrequiring non-concentrated food.\r\n\r\n(c) The facultative parasites need highly organised foods; e. g.,\r\nproteids or other sources of nitrogen and carbon, and salts.\r\n\r\n(d) The saprophytic bacteria are more easily cultivated; e. g.,\r\n\r\n1. Some bacteria will grow in almost pure distilled water.\r\n\r\n2. Some bacteria will grow in pure solutions of the carbohydrates.\r\n\r\n3. _Water_ is absolutely essential to the _growth_ of bacteria.\r\n\r\nFood of a definite reaction is needed for the growth of bacteria. As a\r\ngeneral rule growth is most active in media which react slightly acid to\r\nphenolphthalein--that is, neutral or faintly alkaline to litmus. Mould\r\ngrowth, on the other hand, is most vigourous in media that are strongly\r\nacid to phenolphthalein.\r\n\r\n~Environment.~--The influence of physical agents upon bacterial life and\r\ngrowth is strongly marked.\r\n\r\n1. _Atmosphere._--The presence of _oxygen_ is necessary for the growth\r\nof some bacteria, and death follows when the supply is cut off. Such\r\norganisms are termed _obligate aerobes_.\r\n\r\nSome bacteria appear to thrive equally well whether supplied with or\r\ndeprived of oxygen. These are termed _facultative anaerobes_.\r\n\r\nA third class will only live and multiply when the access of free oxygen\r\nis completely excluded. These are termed _obligate anaerobes_.\r\n\r\n2. _Temperature._--Practically no bacterial growth occurs below 5 deg. C,\r\nand very little above 40 deg. C. 30 deg. C. to 37 deg. C is the most\r\nfavorable for the large majority of micro-organisms.\r\n\r\nThe maximum and minimum temperatures at which growth takes place, as\r\nwell as the optimum, are fairly constant for each bacterium.\r\n\r\nBacteria have been classified, according to their optimum temperature,\r\ninto--\r\n\r\n                                       MIN.       OPT.        MAX.\r\n\r\n1. Psychrophilic bacteria\r\n   (chiefly water organisms)         0 deg. C.  15 deg. C.  30 deg. C.\r\n2. Mesophilic bacteria\r\n   (includes pathogenic bacteria)   15 deg. C.  37 deg. C.  45 deg. C.\r\n3. Thermophilic bacteria            45 deg. C.  55 deg. C.  70 deg. C.\r\n\r\nThe thermal death-point of an organism is another biological constant;\r\nand is that temperature which causes the death of the vegetative forms\r\nwhen the exposure is continued for a period of ten minutes (see pages\r\n298-301).\r\n\r\n3. _Light._--Many organisms are indifferent to the presence of light. On\r\nthe other hand, light frequently impedes growth, and alters to a greater\r\nor lesser extent the biochemical characters of the organisms--e. g.,\r\nchromogenicity or power of liquefaction. Pathogenic bacteria undergo a\r\nprogressive loss of virulence when cultivated in the presence of light.\r\n\r\n4. _Movements._--Movements, if slight and simply of a flowing character,\r\ndo not appear to injuriously affect the growth of bacteria; but violent\r\nagitation, such as shaking, absolutely kills them.\r\n\r\nA condition of perfect rest would seem to be that most conducive to\r\nbacterial growth.\r\n\r\n~The Metabolic Products of Bacteria.~--_Pigment Production._--Many\r\nmicro-organisms produce one or more vivid pigments--yellow, orange, red,\r\nviolet, fluorescent, etc.--during the course of their life and growth.\r\nThe colouring matter usually exists as an intercellular excrementitious\r\nsubstance. Occasionally, however, it appears to be stored actually\r\nwithin the bodies of the bacteria. The chromogenic bacteria are\r\ntherefore classified, in accordance with the final destination of the\r\ncolouring matter they elaborate, into--\r\n\r\n_Chromoparous_ Bacteria: in which the pigment is diffused out upon and\r\ninto the surrounding medium.\r\n\r\n_Chromophorous_ Bacteria: in which the pigment is stored in the cell\r\nprotoplasm of the organism.\r\n\r\n_Parachromophorous_ Bacteria: in which the pigment is stored in the cell\r\nwall of the organism.\r\n\r\nDifferent species of chromogenic bacteria differ in their requirements\r\nas to environment, for the production of their characteristic pigments;\r\ne. g., some need oxygen, light, or high temperature; others again\r\nfavor the converse of these conditions.\r\n\r\n_Light Production._--Some bacteria, and usually those originally derived\r\nfrom water, whether fresh or salt, exhibit marked phosphorescence when\r\ncultivated under suitable conditions. These are classed as \"photogenic.\"\r\n\r\n_Enzyme Production._--Many bacteria produce soluble ferments or enzymes\r\nduring the course of their growth, as evidenced by the liquefaction of\r\ngelatine, the clotting of milk, etc. These ferments may belong to either\r\nof the following well-recognised classes: proteolytic, diastatic,\r\ninvertin, rennet.\r\n\r\n_Toxin Production._--A large number, especially of the pathogenic\r\nbacteria, elaborate or secrete poisonous substances concerning which but\r\nlittle exact knowledge is available, although many would appear to be\r\nenzymic in their action.\r\n\r\nThese toxins are usually differentiated into--\r\n\r\n_Extracellular_ (or Soluble) Toxins: those which are diffused into, and\r\nheld in solution by, the surrounding medium.\r\n\r\n_Intracellular_ (or Inseparate) Toxins: those which are so closely bound\r\nup with the cell protoplasm of the bacteria elaborating them that up to\r\nthe present time no means has been devised for their separation or\r\nextraction.\r\n\r\n_End-products of Metabolism._--Under this heading are included--\r\n\r\nOrganic Acids (e. g., lactic, butyric, etc.).\r\n\r\nAlkalies (e. g., ammonia).\r\n\r\nAromatic Compounds (e. g., indol, phenol).\r\n\r\nReducing Substances (e. g., those reducing nitrates to nitrites).\r\n\r\nGases (e. g., sulphuretted hydrogen, carbon dioxide, etc.).\r\n\r\nAnd while the discussion of their formation, etc., is beyond the scope\r\nof a laboratory handbook, the methods in use for their detection and\r\nseparation come into the ordinary routine work and will therefore be\r\ndescribed (_vide_ page 276 _et seq._).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX. NUTRIENT MEDIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order that the life and growth of bacteria may be accurately observed\r\nin the laboratory, it is necessary--\r\n\r\n1. To _isolate_ individual members of the different varieties of\r\nmicro-organisms.\r\n\r\n2. To _cultivate_ organisms, thus isolated, apart from other associated\r\nor contaminating bacteria--i. e., in _pure culture_.\r\n\r\nFor the successful achievement of these objects it is necessary to\r\nprovide nutriment in a form suited to the needs of the particular\r\nbacterium or bacteria under observation, and in a general way it may be\r\nsaid that the nutrient materials should approximate as closely as\r\npossible, in composition and character, to the natural pabulum of the\r\norganism.\r\n\r\nThe general requirements of bacteria as to their food-supply have\r\nalready been indicated (page 142) and many combinations of proteid and\r\nof carbohydrate have been devised, from time to time, on those lines.\r\nThese, together with various vegetable tissues, physiological or\r\npathological fluid secretions, etc., are collectively spoken of as\r\n_nutrient media_ or _culture media_.\r\n\r\nThe greater number of these media are primarily _fluid_, but, on account\r\nof the rapidity with which bacterial growth diffuses itself through a\r\nliquid, it is impossible to study therein the characteristics of\r\nindividual organisms. Many such media are, therefore, subsequently\r\nrendered solid by the addition of substances like gelatine or agar, in\r\nvarying proportions, the proportions of such added material being\r\ngenerally mentioned when referring to the media; e. g., 10 per cent.\r\ngelatine, 2 per cent. agar. Gelatine is employed for the solidification\r\nof those media it is intended to use in the cultivation of bacteria at\r\nthe room temperature or in the \"cold\" incubator. In the percentages\r\nusually employed, gelatine media become fluid at 25 deg. C.; higher\r\npercentages remain solid at somewhat higher temperatures, but the\r\ndifficulty of filtering strong solutions of gelatine militates against\r\ntheir general use.\r\n\r\nMedia, on the other hand which have been solidified by the addition of\r\nagar, only become liquid when exposed to 90 deg. C. for about ten\r\nminutes, and again solidify when the temperature falls to 40 deg. C.\r\n\r\nWhen it becomes necessary to render these media fluid, heat is applied,\r\nupon the withdrawal of which they again assume their solid condition.\r\nSuch media should be referred to as _liquefiable media_; in point of\r\nfact, however, they are usually grouped together with the solid media.\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--It must here be stated that the designation 10 per\r\n     cent. gelatine or 2 per cent. agar refers only to the\r\n     quantity of those substances actually added in the process\r\n     of manufacture, and _not_ to the percentage of gelatine or\r\n     agar, as the case may be, present in the finished medium;\r\n     the explanation being that the commercial products employed\r\n     contain a large proportion of insoluble material which is\r\n     separated off by filtration during the preparation of the\r\n     liquefiable media.\r\n\r\nOther media, again--e. g., potato, coagulated blood-serum,\r\netc.--cannot be again liquefied by physical means, and these are spoken\r\nof as _solid_ media.\r\n\r\nThe following pages detail the method of preparing the various nutrient\r\nmedia, in ordinary use (see also Chapter XI), those which are only\r\noccasionally required for more highly specialised work are grouped\r\ntogether in Chapter XII. It must be premised that scrupulous cleanliness\r\nis to be observed with regard to all apparatus, vessels, funnels, etc.,\r\nemployed in the preparation of media; although in the preliminary stages\r\nof the preparation of most media absolute sterility of the apparatus\r\nused is not essential.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEAT EXTRACT.\r\n\r\nA watery solution of the extractives, etc., of lean meat (usually beef)\r\nforms the basis of several nutrient media. This solution is termed \"meat\r\nextract\" and it has been determined empirically that its preparation\r\nshall be carried out by extracting half a kilo of moist meat with one\r\nlitre of water. For many purposes, however, it is more convenient to\r\nhave a more concentrated extract; one kilo of meat should therefore be\r\nextracted with one litre of water, to form \"Double Strength\" meat\r\nextract.\r\n\r\nIt was customary at one time, and is even now in some laboratories to\r\nuse either \"shin of beef\" or \"beef-steak\"--both contain muscle sugar\r\nwhich often needs to be removed before the nutrient medium can be\r\ncompleted. Heart muscle (bullock's heart or sheep's heart) is much to be\r\npreferred and from the point of economy, ease and cleanliness of\r\nmanipulation, and extractive value, the imported frozen bullock's hearts\r\nprovide the best extract.\r\n\r\nMeat extract (Fleischwasser) is prepared as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Measure 1000 c.c. of distilled water into a large flask (or glass\r\nbeaker, or enamelled iron pot) and add 1000 grammes (roughly, 2-1/2\r\npounds) of fresh lean meat--e. g., bullock's heart--finely minced in a\r\nmincing machine.\r\n\r\n2. Heat the mixture gently in a water-bath, taking care that the\r\ntemperature of the contents of the flask does not exceed 40 deg. C. for\r\nthe first twenty minutes. (This dissolves out the soluble proteids,\r\nextractives, salts, etc.)\r\n\r\n3. Now raise the temperature of the mixture to the boiling-point, and\r\nmaintain at this temperature for ten minutes. (This precipitates some\r\nof the albumins, the haemoglobin, etc., from the solution.)\r\n\r\n4. Strain the mixture through sterile butter muslin or a perforated\r\nporcelain funnel, then filter the liquid through Swedish filter paper\r\ninto a sterile \"normal\" litre flask, and when cold make up to 1000 c.c.\r\nby the addition of distilled water--to replace the loss from\r\nevaporation.\r\n\r\n5. If not needed at once, sterilise the meat extract in bulk in the\r\nsteam steriliser for twenty minutes on each of three consecutive days.\r\n\r\nCalf, sheep, or chicken flesh is occasionally substituted for the beef;\r\nor the meat extract may be prepared from animal viscera, such as brain,\r\nspleen, liver, or kidneys.\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--As an alternative method, 5 c.c. of Brand's meat\r\n     juice or 3 grammes of Wyeth's beef juice, or 10 grammes\r\n     Liebig's extract of meat (Lemco) may be dissolved in 1000\r\n     c.c. distilled water, and heated and filtered as above to\r\n     form ordinary or single strength meat extract.\r\n\r\n     Media, prepared from such meat extracts are, however,\r\n     eminently unsatisfactory when used for the cultivation of\r\n     the more highly parasitic bacteria; although when working in\r\n     tropical and subtropical regions their use is well-nigh\r\n     compulsory.\r\n\r\n~Reaction of Meat Extract.~--Meat extract thus prepared is acid in its\r\nreaction, owing to the presence of acid phosphates of potassium and\r\nsodium, weak acids of the glycolic series, and organic compounds in\r\nwhich the acid character predominates. Owing to the nature of the\r\nsubstances from which it derives its reaction, the total acidity of meat\r\nextract can only be estimated accurately when the solution is at the\r\nboiling-point.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it has been observed that prolonged boiling (such as is\r\ninvolved in the preparation of nutrient media) causes it to undergo\r\nhydrolytic changes which increase its acidity, and ~the meat extract only\r\nbecomes stable in this respect after it has been maintained at the\r\nboiling-point for forty-five minutes~.\r\n\r\nAlthough meat extract always reacts acid to phenolphthalein, it\r\noccasionally reacts neutral or even alkaline to litmus; and again, meat\r\nextract that has been rendered exactly neutral to litmus still reacts\r\nacid to phenolphthalein. This peculiar behaviour depends upon two\r\nfactors:\r\n\r\n1. Litmus is insensitive to many weak organic acids the presence of\r\nwhich is readily indicated by phenolphthalein.\r\n\r\n2. Dibasic sodium phosphate which is formed during the process of\r\nneutralisation is a salt which reacts alkaline to litmus, but neutral to\r\nphenolphthalein. In order, therefore, to obtain an accurate estimation\r\nof the reaction of any given sample of meat extract, it is essential\r\nthat--\r\n\r\n1. The meat extract be previously exposed to a temperature of 100 deg. C.\r\nfor forty-five minutes.\r\n\r\n2. The estimation be performed at the boiling-point.\r\n\r\n3. Phenolphthalein be used as the indicator.\r\n\r\nThe estimation is carried out by means of titration experiments against\r\nstandard solutions of caustic soda, in the following manner:\r\n\r\n_Method of Estimating the Reaction._--\r\n\r\n_Apparatus Required_:                  _Solutions Required_:\r\n\r\n1. 25 c.c. burette graduated           1. 10N NaOH, accurately\r\nin tenths of a centimetre.             standardised.\r\n\r\n2. 1 c.c. pipette graduated in         2. n/1 NaOH, accurately\r\nhundredths, and provided               standardised\r\nwith rubber tube, pinch-cock,\r\nand delivery nozzle.\r\n\r\n3. 25 c.c. measure (cylinder or        3. n/10 NaOH, accurately\r\npipette, calibrated for                standardised.\r\n98 deg. C.--_not_ 15 deg. C).\r\n\r\n4. Several 60 c.c. conical             4. 0.5 per cent. solution of\r\nbeakers or Erlenmeyer                  phenolphthalein in 50 per\r\nflasks.                                cent. alcohol.\r\n\r\n5. White porcelain evaporating basin, filled with boiling water and\r\narranged over a gas flame as a water-bath.\r\n\r\n6. Bohemian glass flask, fitted as a wash-bottle, and filled\r\nwith distilled water, which is kept boiling on a tripod stand.\r\n\r\nMETHOD.--Arrange the apparatus as indicated in figure 97.\r\n\r\n(A) 1. Fill the burette with n/10 NaOH.\r\n\r\n2. Fill the pipette with n/1 NaOH.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 97.--Arrangement of apparatus for titrating media.]\r\n\r\n3. Measure 25 c.c. of the meat extract (previously heated in the steamer\r\nat 100 deg. C. for forty-five minutes) into one of the beakers by means of\r\nthe measure; rinse out the measure with a very small quantity of boiling\r\ndistilled water from the wash-bottle, and then add this rinse water to\r\nthe meat extract already in the beaker.\r\n\r\n4. Run in about 0.5 c.c. of the phenolphthalein solution and immerse the\r\nbeaker in the water-bath, and raise to the boil.\r\n\r\n5. To the medium in the beaker run in n/10 NaOH cautiously from the\r\nburette until the end-point is reached, as indicated by the development\r\nof a pinkish tinge, shown in figure 98 (b). Note the amount of\r\ndecinormal soda solution used in the process.\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--Just before the end-point is reached, a very slight\r\n     opalescence may be noted in the fluid, due to the\r\n     precipitation of dibasic phosphates. After the true\r\n     end-point is reached, the further addition of about 0.5 c.c.\r\n     of the decinormal soda solution will produce a deep magenta\r\n     colour (Fig. 98, c), which is the so-called \"end-point\" of\r\n     the American Committee of Bacteriologists.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 98.--a, Sample of filtered meat extract or\r\nnutrient gelatine to which phenolphthalein has been added. The medium is\r\nacid, as evidenced by the unaltered colour of the sample. b, The same\r\nneutralised by the addition of n/10 NaOH. The production of this faint\r\nrose-pink colour indicates that the \"end-point,\" or neutral point to\r\nphenolphthalein, has been reached. If such a sample is cooled down to\r\nsay 30 deg. or 20 deg. C., the colour will be found to become more distinct\r\nand decidedly deeper and brighter, resembling that shown in c. c, Also\r\nif, after the end-point is reached, a further 0.5 c.c. or 1.0 c.c. n/10\r\nNaOH be added to the sample, the marked alkalinity is evidenced by the\r\ndeep colour here shown.]\r\n\r\n(B) Perform a \"control\" titration (occasionally two controls may be\r\nnecessary), as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Measure 25 c.c. of the meat extract into one of the beakers, wash out\r\nthe measure with boiling water, and add the phenolphthalein as in the\r\nfirst estimation.\r\n\r\n2. Run in n/1 NaOH from the pipette, just short of the equivalent of the\r\namount of _deci_-normal soda solution required to neutralise the 25 c.c.\r\nof medium. (For example, if in the first estimation 5 c.c. of n/10 NaOH\r\nwere required to render 25 c.c. of medium neutral to phenolphthalein,\r\nonly add 0.48 c.c. of n/1 NaOH.) Immerse the beaker in the water-bath.\r\n\r\n3. Complete the titration by the aid of the n/10 NaOH.\r\n\r\n4. Note the amount of n/10 NaOH solution required to complete the\r\ntitration, and add it to the equivalent of the n/1 NaOH solution\r\npreviously run in. Take the total as the correct estimation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Method of Expressing the Reaction._--\r\n\r\nThe reaction or _titre_ of meat extract, medium, or any solution\r\nestimated in the foregoing manner, is most conveniently expressed by\r\nindicating the number of cubic centimetres of normal alkali (or normal\r\nacid) that would be required to render _one litre_ of the solution\r\nexactly neutral to phenolphthalein.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 99.--Stock bottle for dekanormal soda solution.]\r\n\r\nThe sign + (plus) is prefixed to this number if the original solution\r\nreacts acid, and the sign - (minus) if it reacts alkaline.\r\n\r\nFor example, \"meat extract + 10,\" indicates a sample of meat extract\r\nwhich reacts acid to phenolphthalein, and would require the addition of\r\n10 c.c. of _normal_ NaOH per litre, to neutralise it.\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--Such a solution would probably react alkaline to\r\n     litmus.\r\n\r\nConversely, if as the result of our titration experiments we find that\r\n25 c.c. of meat extract require the addition of 5 c.c. n/10 NaOH to\r\nneutralise, then 1000 c.c. of meat extract will require the addition of\r\n200 c.c. n/10 NaOH = 20 c.c. n/1 NaOH.\r\n\r\nAnd this last figure, 20, preceded by the sign + (i. e., +20), to\r\nsignify that it is acid, indicates the reaction of the meat extract.\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--The standard soda solutions should be prepared by\r\n     accurate measuring operations, controlled by titrations,\r\n     from a stock solution of 10N NaOH, which should be very\r\n     carefully standardised. If a large supply is made or the\r\n     consumption is small this stock solution must be kept in an\r\n     aspirator bottle to which air can only gain access after it\r\n     has been dried and rendered free from CO_{2}. This may be\r\n     done by first leading it over H_{2}SO_{4} and soda lime, or\r\n     soda lime alone, by some such arrangement as is shown in\r\n     figure 99, which also shows a constant burette arrangement\r\n     for the delivery of small measured quantities of the\r\n     dekanormal soda solution.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTANDARDISATION OF MEDIA.\r\n\r\nDifferences in the reaction of the medium in which it is grown will\r\nprovoke not only differences in the rate of growth of any given\r\nbacterium, but also well-marked differences in its cultural and\r\nmorphological characters; and nearly every organism will be found to\r\naffect a definite \"optimum reaction\"--a point to be carefully determined\r\nfor each. For most bacteria, however, the \"optimum\" usually approximates\r\nfairly closely to +10; and as experiment has shown that this reaction is\r\nthe most generally useful for routine laboratory work, it is the one\r\nwhich may be adopted as the standard for all nutrient media derived from\r\nmeat extract.\r\n\r\nBriefly, the method of standardising a litre of media to +10 consists in\r\nsubtracting 10 from the initial _titre_ of the medium mass; the\r\nremainder indicates the number of cubic centimetres of normal soda\r\nsolution that must be added to the medium, per litre, to render the\r\nreaction +10.\r\n\r\n~Standardising Nutrient Bouillon.~--For example, 1000 c.c. bouillon are\r\nprepared; at the first titration it is found\r\n\r\n1. 25 c.c. require the addition of 5.50 c.c. n/10 NaOH to neutralise.\r\n\r\nTwo controls give the following results:\r\n\r\n2. 25 c.c. require the addition of 5.70 c.c. n/10 NaOH to neutralise.\r\n\r\n3. 25 c.c. require the addition of 5.60 c.c. n/10 NaOH to neutralise.\r\n\r\nAveraging these two controls, 25 c.c. require the addition of 5.65 c.c.\r\nn/10 NaOH to neutralise, and therefore 1000 c.c. require the addition of\r\n226 c.c. n/10 NaOH, or 22.60 c.c. n/1 NaOH, or 2.26 c.c. n/10 NaOH.\r\n\r\nInitial _titre_ of the bouillon = +22.6, and as such requires the\r\naddition of (22.6 c.c. - 10 c.c.) = 12.6 c.c. of n/1 NaOH per litre to\r\nleave its finished reaction +10.\r\n\r\nBut the three titrations, each on 25 c.c. of medium, have reduced the\r\noriginal bulk of bouillon to (1000 - 75 c.c.) = 925 c.c. The amount of\r\nn/1 NaOH required to render the reaction of this quantity of medium +10\r\nmay be deduced thus:\r\n\r\n    1000 c.c.:925 c.c.::12.6 c.c.:x.\r\n\r\nThen x = 11.65 c.c. n/1 NaOH.\r\n\r\nWhenever possible, however, the required reaction is produced by the\r\naddition of dekanormal soda solution, on account of the minute increase\r\nit causes in the bulk, and the consequent insignificant disturbance of\r\nthe percentage composition of the medium. By means of a pipette\r\ngraduated to 0.01 c.c. it is possible to deliver very small quantities;\r\nbut if the calculated amount runs into thousandth parts of a cubic\r\ncentimetre, these are replaced by corresponding quantities of normal or\r\neven decinormal soda.\r\n\r\nIn the above example it is necessary to add 11.65 c.c. normal NaOH or\r\nits equivalent, 1.165 c.c. dekanormal NaOH. The first being too bulky a\r\nquantity, and the second inconveniently small for exact measurement, the\r\ntotal weight of soda is obtained by substituting 1.16 c.c. dekanormal\r\nsoda solution, and either 0.05 c.c. of normal soda solution or 0.5 c.c.\r\nof decinormal soda solution.\r\n\r\n~Standardising Nutrient Agar and Gelatine.~--The method of standardising\r\nagar and gelatine is precisely similar to that described under bouillon.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FILTRATION OF MEDIA.\r\n\r\n~Fluid media~ are usually filtered through stout Swedish filter paper\r\n(occasionally through a porcelain filter candle), and in order to\r\naccelerate the rate of filtration the filter paper should be folded in\r\nthat form which is known as the \"physiological filter,\" not in the\r\nordinary \"quadrant\" shape, as by this means a large surface is available\r\nfor filtration and a smaller area in contact with the glass funnel\r\nsupporting it.\r\n\r\nTo fold the filter proceed thus:\r\n\r\n1. Take a circular piece of filter paper and fold it exactly through its\r\ncentre to form a semicircle (Fig. 100, a).\r\n\r\n2. Fold the semicircle exactly in half to form a quadrant; make the\r\ncrease 2, distinct by running the thumbnail along it, then open the\r\nfilter out to a semicircle again.\r\n\r\n3. Fold each end of the semicircle in to the centre and so form another\r\nquadrant; smooth down the two new creases 3 and 3a, thus formed and\r\nagain open out to a semicircle.\r\n\r\n4. The semicircle now appears as in figure 100, a, the dark lines\r\nindicating the creases already formed.\r\n\r\n5. Fold the point 1 over to the point 3, and 1a to 3a, to form the\r\ncreases 4 and 4a, indicated in the diagram by the light lines. Fold\r\npoint 1 over to 3a, and 1a to 3, to form the creases 5 and 5a.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 100.--Filter folding: a, Filter folded in half,\r\nshowing creases; b, appearance of filter on completion of folding;\r\nc, filter opened out ready for use.]\r\n\r\n6. Thus far the creases have all been made on the same side of the\r\npaper. Now subdivide each of the eight sectors by a crease through its\r\ncentre on the opposite side of the paper, indicated by the faint broken\r\nlines in the diagram. Fold up the filter gradually as each crease is\r\nmade, and when finished the filter has assumed the shape of a wedge, as\r\nin figure 100, b.\r\n\r\nWhen opened out the filter assumes the shape represented in figure 100,\r\nc.\r\n\r\nThe folded filter is next placed inside a glass funnel supported on a\r\nretort stand, and moistened with hot distilled water before the\r\nfiltration of the medium is commenced.\r\n\r\n~Liquefiable solid media~ are filtered through a specially made filter\r\npaper--\"papier Chardin\"--which is sold in boxes of twenty-five\r\nready-folded filters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 101.--Hot-water filter funnel and ring burner.]\r\n\r\nGelatine, when properly made, filters through this paper as quickly as\r\nbouillon does through the Swedish filter paper, and does _not_ require\r\nthe use of the hot-water funnel.\r\n\r\nAgar, likewise, if properly made, filters readily, although not at so\r\nrapid a rate as gelatine. If badly \"egged,\" and also during the winter\r\nmonths, it is necessary to surround the glass funnel, in which the\r\nfiltration of the agar is carried on, by a hot-water jacket. This is\r\ndone by placing the glass funnel inside a double-walled copper\r\nfunnel--the space between the walls being filled with water at about\r\n90 deg. C.--and supporting the latter on a ring gas burner fixed to a\r\nretort stand (Fig. 101). The gas is lighted and the water jacket\r\nmaintained at a high temperature until filtration is completed. If the\r\nsteam steriliser of the laboratory is sufficiently large, it is sometimes\r\nmore convenient to place the flask and filtering funnel bodily inside,\r\nclose the steriliser and allow filtration to proceed in an atmosphere of\r\nlive steam, than to use the gas ring and hot-water funnel.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTORING MEDIA IN BULK.\r\n\r\nAfter filtration fill the medium into sterile litre flasks with\r\ncotton-wool plugs and sterilise in the steamer for twenty minutes on\r\neach of three consecutive days. After the third sterilisation, and when\r\nthe flasks and contents are cool, cut off the top of the cotton-wool\r\nplug square with the mouth of the flask; push the plug a short distance\r\ndown into the neck of the flask and fill in with melted paraffin wax to\r\nthe level of the mouth. When the wax has set the flasks are stored in a\r\ncool dark cupboard for future use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 102.--Rubber cap closing store bottle. a, before,\r\nand b, after sterilizing.]\r\n\r\nThis plan is not absolutely satisfactory, although very generally\r\nemployed on occasion, and it is preferable to fill the medium into\r\nlong-necked flint glass bottles (the quart size, holding nearly 1000\r\nc.c., such as those in which Pasteurised milk is retailed) and to close\r\nthe neck of the bottle by a special rubber cap.[3] This cap is made of\r\nsoft rubber, the lower part, dome-shaped with thin walls, being slipped\r\nover the neck of the bottle (Fig. 102, a). The upper part is solid,\r\nbut with a sharp clean-cut (made with a cataract or tenotomy knife)\r\nrunning completely through its axis from the centre of the disc to the\r\ntop of the dome. During sterilisation the air in the neck of the bottle,\r\nexpanded by the heat, is driven out through the valvular aperture in the\r\nsolid portion of the stopper. On removing the bottle from the steam\r\nchamber, the liquid contracts as it cools, and the pressure of the\r\nexternal air drives the solid piece of rubber down into the neck of the\r\nbottle, and forces together the lips of the slit (Fig. 102, b). Thus\r\nsealed, the bottle will preserve its contents sterile for an indefinite\r\nperiod without loss from evaporation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTUBING NUTRIENT MEDIA.\r\n\r\nAfter the final filtration, the nutrient medium is usually \"tubed\"--_i.\r\ne._, filled into sterile tubes in definite measured quantities, usually\r\n10 c.c. This process is sometimes carried out by means of a large\r\nseparator funnel fitted with a \"three-way\" tap which communicates with a\r\nsmall graduated tube (capacity 20 c.c. and graduated in cubic\r\ncentimetres) attached to the side. The shape of this piece of apparatus,\r\nknown as Treskow's funnel, renders it particularly liable to damage. It\r\nis better, therefore, to arrange a less expensive piece of apparatus\r\nwhich will serve the purpose equally well (Fig. 103).\r\n\r\nA Geissler's three-way stop-cock has the tube on one side of the tap\r\nground obliquely at its extremity, and the tube on the opposite side cut\r\noff within 3 cm. of the tap. The short tube is connected by means of a\r\nperforated rubber cork with a 10 cm. length of stout glass tubing (1.5\r\ncm. bore). The third channel of the three-way tap is connected, by means\r\nof rubber tubing, with the nozzle of an ordinary separator funnel.\r\nFinally, the receiving cylinder above the three-way tap is graduated in\r\ncubic centimetres up to 20, by pouring into it measured quantities of\r\nwater and marking the various levels on the outside with a writing\r\ndiamond.\r\n\r\nFluid media containing carbohydrates are filled into fermentation tubes\r\n(_vide_ Fig. 21); or into ordinary media tubes which already have\r\nsmaller tubes, inverted, inside them (Fig. 104), to collect the products\r\nof growth of gas-forming bacteria. When first filled, the small tubes\r\nfloat on the surface of the medium after the first sterilisation nearly\r\nall the air is replaced by the medium, and after the final sterilisation\r\nthe gas tubes will be submerged and completely filled with the medium.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 103.--Separatory funnel and three-way tap arranged\r\nfor tubing media.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 104.--Gas tube (Durham).]\r\n\r\n~Storing \"Tubed\" Media.~--Media after being tubed are best stored by\r\npacking, in the vertical position, in oblong boxes having an internal\r\nmeasurement of 37 cm. long by 12 cm. wide by 10 cm. deep. Each box (Fig.\r\n105) has a movable partition formed by the vertical face of a weighted\r\ntriangular block of wood, sliding free on the bottom (Fig. 105, A); or\r\nby a flat piece of wood sliding in a metal groove in the bottom of the\r\nbox, which can be fixed at any spot by tightening the thumbscrew of a\r\nbrass guide rod which transfixes the partition (Fig. 105, B). The front\r\nof the box is provided with a handle and a celluloid label for the name\r\nof the contained medium. These boxes are arranged upon shelves in a dark\r\ncupboard--or preferably an iron safe--which should be rendered as nearly\r\nair-tight as possible, and should have the words \"media stores\" painted\r\non its doors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 105.--Medium box, showing alternative partitions A\r\nand B.]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[3] This rubber cap has been made for me by the Holborn Surgical\r\nInstrument Co., Thavies Inn, London, W. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI. CULTURE MEDIA.\r\n\r\nORDINARY OR STOCK MEDIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Nutrient Bouillon.~--\r\n\r\n1. Measure out double strength meat extract, 500 c.c., into a litre\r\nflask and add 300 c.c. distilled water.\r\n\r\n2. Weigh out Witte's peptone, 10 grammes (= 1 per cent.), salt, 5\r\ngrammes (= 0.5 per cent.), and mix into a smooth paste with 200 c.c. of\r\ndistilled water previously heated to 60 deg. C. (Be careful to leave no\r\nunbroken globular masses of peptone.)\r\n\r\n3. Add the peptone emulsion to the meat extract in the flask and heat in\r\nthe steamer for forty-five minutes (to completely dissolve the peptone,\r\nand to render the acidity of the meat extract stable).\r\n\r\n4. Estimate the reaction of the medium; control the result; render the\r\nreaction of the finished medium +10 (_vide_ page 155).\r\n\r\n5. Heat for half an hour in the steamer at 100 deg. C. (to complete the\r\nprecipitation of the phosphates, etc.).\r\n\r\n6. Filter through Swedish filter paper into a sterile flask.\r\n\r\n7. Fill into sterile tubes (10 c.c. in each tube).\r\n\r\n8. Sterilise in the steamer for twenty minutes on each of three\r\nconsecutive days--i. e., by the discontinuous method (_vide_ page 35).\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--As an alternative method when neither fresh nor\r\n     frozen meat is available nutrient bouillon may be prepared\r\n     from a commercial meat extract, as follows:\r\n\r\n     ~Lemco Broth.~--\r\n\r\n     1. Measure out 250 c.c. distilled water into a litre flask.\r\n\r\n     2. Weigh out 10 grammes Liebig's Lemco Meat Extract on a\r\n     piece of clean filter paper and add to the water in the\r\n     flask. Shake the flask well to make an even emulsion of the\r\n     meat extract.\r\n\r\n     3. Weigh out Witte's peptone (10 grammes), salt (5 grammes).\r\n     Mix into smooth paste with 100 c.c. distilled water\r\n     previously heated to 60 deg. C.\r\n\r\n     4. Add the peptone salt emulsion to the meat extract\r\n     emulsion in the flask and add 650 c.c. distilled water. Heat\r\n     in the steamer for forty-five minutes.\r\n\r\n     5. Standardise the medium and complete as for nutrient\r\n     bouillon.\r\n\r\n~Nutrient Gelatine.~--\r\n\r\n1. Weigh a 2-litre flask on a trip balance (Fig. 106) and note the\r\nweight, or counterpoise carefully.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 106.--Trip balance.]\r\n\r\nAn extremely useful counterpoise is a small sheet-brass cylinder about\r\n38 mm. high and 38 mm. in diameter, with a funnel-shaped top and\r\nprovided with a side tube by which its contents, fine \"dust\" shot, may\r\nbe emptied out (Fig. 107).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 107.--Counterpoise; weight when empty, 35 grammes;\r\nwhen full of dust shot, 200 grammes.]\r\n\r\n2. Measure out double strength meat extract, 500 c.c., into the \"tared\"\r\nflask.\r\n\r\n3. Weigh out and mix 10 grammes of peptone, 5 grammes of salt, and make\r\ninto a thick paste with 150 c.c. distilled water; then add the emulsion\r\nto the meat extract in the flask; also add 100 grammes sheet gelatine\r\ncut into small pieces; place the flask in the water-bath and raise to\r\nthe boil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 108.--Arrangement of steam can and water-bath for\r\nthe preparation of media.]\r\n\r\n4. Arrange a 5-litre tin can (with copper bottom, such as is used in the\r\npreparation of distilled water) by the side of the water bath, fill the\r\ncan with boiling water and place a lighted Bunsen burner under it. Fit a\r\nlong safety tube to the neck of the can and also a delivery tube, bent\r\ntwice at right angles; adjust the tube to reach to the bottom of the\r\ninterior of the flask containing the gelatine, etc. (Fig. 108).\r\n\r\n5. Keep the water in the steam can vigourously boiling, and so steam at\r\n100 deg. C, bubbling through the medium mass, for ten minutes, by\r\nwhich time complete solution of the gelatine is effected. A certain\r\namount of steam will condense as water in the medium flask during this\r\nprocess--hence the necessity for the use of double strength meat\r\nextract--but if the water bath is kept boiling this condensation will\r\nnot exceed 100 c.c.\r\n\r\n6. Weigh the flask and its contents; then (1115[4] grammes + weight of\r\nthe flask) minus (weight of the flask and its contents) equals the\r\nweight of water required to make up the bulk to 1 litre. The addition of\r\nthe requisite quantity of water is carried out as follows:\r\n\r\nIn one pan of the trip balance place the counterpoise of the tared flask\r\n(or its equivalent in weights) together with the weights making up the\r\n_calculated medium weight_. In the opposite pan place the flask\r\ncontaining the medium mass. Now add boiling distilled water from a wash\r\nbottle until the two pans are exactly balanced.\r\n\r\n7. Titrate and estimate the reaction of the medium mass; control the\r\nresult. Calculate the amount of soda solution required to make the\r\nreaction of the medium mass +10 (i. e., calculate for 1000 c.c., less\r\nthe quantity used for the titrations).\r\n\r\n8. Add the necessary amount of soda solution and heat in the steamer at\r\n100 deg. C. for twenty minutes, to precipitate the phosphates, etc.\r\n\r\n9. Allow the medium mass to cool to 60 deg. C. Well whip the whites of\r\ntwo eggs, add to the contents of the flask and replace in the steamer at\r\n100 deg. C. for about half an hour (until the egg-albumen has coagulated\r\nand formed large, firm masses floating on and in clear gelatine).\r\n\r\n10. Filter through papier Chardin into a sterile flask.\r\n\r\n11. Tube in quantities of 10 c.c.\r\n\r\n12. Sterilise in the steamer at 100 deg. C. for twenty minutes on each of\r\nthree consecutive days--i. e., by the discontinuous method.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Nutrient Agar-agar.~--\r\n\r\n1. Weigh a 2-litre flask and note the weight--or counterpoise exactly.\r\n\r\n2. Measure out double strength meat extract, 500 c.c., into the \"tared\"\r\nflask.\r\n\r\n3. Weigh out and mix 10 grammes of peptone, 5 grammes of salt, and 20\r\ngrammes of powdered agar, and make into a thick paste with 150 c.c.\r\ndistilled water, and add to the meat extract in the flask; place the\r\nflask in a water-bath.\r\n\r\n4. Arrange the steam can and water-bath as already directed (for the\r\npreparation of gelatine) and figured.\r\n\r\n5. Bubble live steam (at 100 deg. C.) through the medium mass, for\r\ntwenty-five minutes, by which time complete solution of the agar is\r\neffected.\r\n\r\n6. Now weigh the flask and its contents; then (1035[5] grammes + weight\r\nof flask) minus (weight of flask and its contents) equals the weight of\r\nwater required to make up the bulk of the medium to 1 litre. Add the\r\nrequisite amount (see preparation of gelatine, page 166, step 6).\r\n\r\n7. Titrate, and estimate the reaction of the medium mass; control the\r\nresult. Calculate the amount of soda solution required to make the\r\nreaction of the medium mass + 10 (i. e., calculated for 1000 c.c.,\r\nless the quantity used for the titrations).\r\n\r\n8. Add the necessary amount of soda solution and replace in the steamer\r\nfor twenty minutes (to complete the precipitation of the phosphates,\r\netc.).\r\n\r\n9. Allow the medium mass to cool to 60 deg. C. Well whip the whites of\r\ntwo eggs, add to the contents of the flask, and replace in the steamer at\r\n100 deg. C. for about _one hour_ (until the egg-albumen has coagulated\r\nand formed large, firm masses floating on and in clear agar.)\r\n\r\n10. Filter through papier Chardin, by the aid of a hot-water funnel, if\r\nnecessary (Fig. 101), into a sterile flask.\r\n\r\n11. Tube in quantities of 10 c.c. or 15 c.c.\r\n\r\n12. Sterilise in the steamer at 100 deg. C. for thirty minutes on each of\r\nthree consecutive days--i. e., by the discontinuous method.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Blood-serum (Inspissated).~--\r\n\r\n1. Sterilise cylindrical glass jar (Fig. 109) and its cover by dry heat,\r\nor by washing first with ether and then with alcohol and drying.\r\n\r\n2. Collect blood at the slaughter house from ox or sheep in the sterile\r\ncylinder.\r\n\r\n3. Allow the vessel to stand for fifteen minutes for the blood to\r\ncoagulate. (This must be done before leaving the slaughterhouse,\r\notherwise the serum will be stained with haemoglobin.)\r\n\r\n4. Separate the clot from the sides of the vessel by means of a sterile\r\nglass rod (the yield of serum is much smaller when this is not done),\r\nand place the cylinder in the ice-chest for twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n5. Remove the serum with sterile pipettes, or syphon it off, and fill\r\ninto sterile tubes (5 c.c. in each) or flasks.\r\n\r\n6. Heat tubes containing serum to 56 deg. C. in a water-bath for half an\r\nhour on each of two successive days.\r\n\r\n7. On the third day, heat the tubes, in a sloping position, in a serum\r\ninspissator to about 72 deg. C. (A coagulum is formed at this temperature\r\nwhich is fairly transparent; above 72 deg. C., a thick turbid coagulum is\r\nformed.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 109.--Blood-serum jar with wicker basket for\r\ntransport.]\r\n\r\nThe serum inspissator (Fig. 110) in its simplest form is a double-walled\r\nrectangular copper box, closed in by a loose glass lid, and cased in\r\nfelt or asbestos--the space between the walls is filled with water. The\r\ninspissator is supported on adjustable legs so that the serum may be\r\nsolidified at any desired \"slant,\" and is heated from below by a Bunsen\r\nburner controlled by a thermo-regulator. The more elaborate forms\r\nresemble the hot-air oven (Fig. 26) in shape and are provided with\r\nadjustable shelves so that any desired obliquity of the serum slope can\r\nbe obtained.\r\n\r\n8. Place the tubes in the incubator at 37 deg. C. for forty-eight hours\r\nin order to eliminate those that have been contaminated. Store the\r\nremainder in a cool place for future use.\r\n\r\n_Alternative Method._\r\n\r\n_Steps 1-5 as above._\r\n\r\n6. Sterilise the serum by the fractional method--that is, by exposure in\r\na water-bath to a temperature of 56 deg. C. for half an hour on each of\r\nsix consecutive days; store in the fluid condition.\r\n\r\n7. Coagulate in the inspissator when needed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 110.--Serum inspissator.]\r\n\r\n     ~Serum Water.~--\r\n\r\n     This forms the basis of many useful media, and is prepared\r\n     as follows:\r\n\r\n     1. Collect blood in the slaughterhouse (see page 168) and\r\n     when firmly clotted collect all the expressed serum and\r\n     measure in a graduated cylinder.\r\n\r\n     2. For every 100 c.c. of serum add 300 c.c. distilled water\r\n     and mix in a flask.\r\n\r\n     3. Heat the mixture in the steamer at 100 deg. C. for thirty\r\n     minutes. (This destroys any diastatic ferment present in the\r\n     serum and partially sterilises the fluid.)\r\n\r\n     4. Filter if turbid.\r\n\r\n     5. If not needed at once complete the sterilisation of the\r\n     serum water by two subsequent steamings at 100 deg. C. for\r\n     twenty minutes at twenty-four hour intervals.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Citrated Blood Agar. Guy's.~--\r\n\r\n1. Kill a small rabbit with chloroform vapour, and nail it out on a\r\nboard (as for a necropsy); moisten the hair thoroughly with 2 per cent.\r\nsolution of lysol.\r\n\r\n2. Sterilise several pairs of forceps, scissors, etc. by boiling.\r\n\r\n3. Reflect the skin over the thorax with sterile instruments.\r\n\r\n4. Open the thoracic cavity by the aid of a fresh set of sterile\r\ninstruments.\r\n\r\n5. Open the pericardium with another set of sterile instruments.\r\n\r\n6. Sear the surface of the left ventricle with a red-hot iron.\r\n\r\n7. Take a sterile capillary pipette (Fig. 13, c); break off the sealed\r\nextremity with a pair of sterile forceps.\r\n\r\n8. Steady the heart in a pair of forceps and thrust the point of the\r\npipette through the wall of the ventricle and through the seared area,\r\napply suction to the plugged end of the pipette and fill it with blood.\r\n\r\n9. Transfer the entire quantity of blood collected from the rabbit's\r\nheart to a small Erlenmeyer flask containing a number of sterile glass\r\nbeads and 5 c.c. concentrated sod. citrate solution. (See page 378.)\r\n\r\n10. Agitate thoroughly and set aside for a couple of hours.\r\n\r\n11. Melt up several tubes of nutrient agar (see page 167) and cool to\r\n42 deg. C.\r\n\r\n12. With a sterile 10 c.c. graduated pipette transfer 1 c.c. citrated\r\nblood from the Erlenmeyer flask to each tube of liquefied agar. Rotate\r\nthe tube between the hands in order to diffuse the citrated blood evenly\r\nthroughout the agar.\r\n\r\n13. Place the tubes in a sloping position and allow the medium to set.\r\n\r\n14. Place tubes of blood agar for forty-eight hours in the incubator at\r\n37 deg. C. and at the end of that time eliminate any contaminated tubes.\r\n\r\n15. Store such tubes as remain sterile for future use.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Milk.~--\r\n\r\n1. Pour 1 litre of fresh cow's or goat's milk into a large separating\r\nfunnel, and heat in the steamer at 100 deg. C. for one hour.\r\n\r\n2. Remove from the steamer and estimate the reaction of the milk (normal\r\ncows' milk averages +17). If of higher acidity than +20, or lower than\r\n+10, reject this sample of milk and proceed with another supply of milk\r\nfrom a different source.\r\n\r\nReject milk to which antiseptics have been added as preservatives.\r\n\r\n3. Allow the milk to cool, when the fat or cream will rise to the\r\nsurface and form a thick layer.\r\n\r\n4. Draw off the subnatant fat-free milk into sterile tubes (10 c.c. in\r\neach).\r\n\r\n5. Sterilise in the steamer at 100 deg. C. for twenty minutes on each of\r\nfive successive days.\r\n\r\n6. Incubate at 37 deg. C. for forty-eight hours and eliminate any\r\ncontaminated tubes. Store the remainder for future use.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Litmus Milk.~--\r\n\r\n1. Prepare milk as described above, sections 1 to 3.\r\n\r\n2. Draw off the subnatant fat-free milk into a flask.\r\n\r\n3. Add sterile litmus solution, sufficient to colour the milk a deep\r\nlavender.\r\n\r\n4. Tube, sterilise, etc., as for milk.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Nutrose Agar (Eyre).~--\r\n\r\n(This is a modification of the well known Drigalski-Conradi medium\r\noriginally introduced for the isolation of B. typhosus).\r\n\r\n1. Collect 250 c.c. perfectly fresh ox serum (_vide_ Blood Serum, page\r\n168, steps 1 to 5) and add to it 450 c.c. sterile distilled water.\r\n\r\n2. Weigh out agar powder, 20 grammes, and emulsify it with 250 c.c. of\r\nthe cold serum water.\r\n\r\n3. Weigh out\r\n\r\n    Witte's peptone        10 grammes\r\n    Sodium chloride         5 grammes\r\n    Nutrose                10 grammes\r\n\r\nand dissolve in 200 c.c. of serum water heated to 80 deg. C.\r\n\r\n4. Mix the agar emulsion and the peptone-nutrose solution in a \"tared\"\r\nflask of 2-litre capacity and add a further 100 c.c. serum water.\r\n\r\n5. Complete the solution of the various ingredients by bubbling live\r\nsteam through the flask as in making nutrient agar.\r\n\r\n6. Add further 250 c.c. serum water.\r\n\r\n7. Weigh the flask and its contents: then (1045 grammes + weight of\r\nflask) minus (weight of flask and its present contents) = weight of\r\nfluid required to make up the bulk of the medium to 1 litre. Add the\r\nrequisite amount of sterile distilled water.\r\n\r\n8. Titrate and estimate the reaction of the medium mass. Then\r\nstandardise to reaction of +2.5.\r\n\r\n9. Clarify with egg, and filter as for nutrient agar. (In clarifying,\r\nafter the addition of the egg white the mixture should be in the steamer\r\nfor full two hours.)\r\n\r\n10. After filtration is complete measure the filtrate, and to every 150\r\nc.c. of the medium add:\r\n\r\nLitmus solution (Kahlbaum)                              20   c.c.\r\nKrystal violet aqueous solution (1:1000) (B. Hoechst)    1.5 c.c.\r\nLactose                                                  1.5 grammes\r\n\r\n11. Tube in quantities of 15 c.c.\r\n\r\n12. Sterilise in the steamer at 100 deg. C. for thirty minutes on each\r\nof three successive days--i. e., by the discontinuous method for three\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Egg Medium (Dorset).~--\r\n\r\n1. Prepare 1000 c.c. of a 0.85 per cent. solution of sodium chloride in\r\na stout 2-litre flask.\r\n\r\n2. Sterilise in the autoclave at 120 deg. C. for twenty minutes. Cool\r\nto 20 deg. C.\r\n\r\n3. Take 12 fresh eggs; wash the shells first with water then with\r\nundiluted formalin: allow the shells to dry.\r\n\r\n4. Break the eggs into a sterile graduated cylinder and measure the\r\ntotal volume of the mixed whites and yolks. Add one part sterile saline\r\nsolution to three parts mixed eggs.\r\n\r\n5. Transfer this mixture to a large wide-mouthed stoppered bottle\r\npreviously sterilised. Add sterile glass beads and shake thoroughly in a\r\nmechanical shaker for about thirty minutes, or whip with an egg-whisk.\r\n\r\n6. Filter through coarse butter muslin into a sterile flask.\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--A few drops of alcoholic solution of basic fuchsin\r\n     (sufficient to give a definite pink colour), or a few drops\r\n     of waterproof Chinese ink added to the medium at this stage\r\n     facilitates the subsequent \"fishing\" of colonies.\r\n\r\n7. Tube in quantities of 10 c.c.\r\n\r\n8. Solidify in the sloping position in the inspissator at 75 deg. C.\r\nfor one hour.\r\n\r\n9. Place the tubes for forty-eight hours in the incubator at 37 deg. C.,\r\nand eliminate any contaminated tubes.\r\n\r\nTo prevent drying, 0.5 c.c. glycerine bouillon (see page 209) may be\r\nadded to each tube between steps 8 and 9.\r\n\r\n10. Cap those tubes of media which remain sterile with india-rubber caps\r\nand store for future use.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Potato.~--\r\n\r\n1. Choose fairly large potatoes, wash them well, and scrub the peel with\r\na stiff nail-brush.\r\n\r\n2. Peel and take out the eyes.\r\n\r\n3. Remove cylinders from the longest diameter of each potato by means of\r\nan apple-corer or a large cork-borer (i. e., one of about 1.4 cm.\r\ndiameter).\r\n\r\nThe reaction of the fresh potato is strongly acid to phenolphthalein.\r\nIf, therefore, the potatoes are required to approximate +10, as for the\r\ncultivation of some of the vibrios, the cylinders should be soaked in a\r\n1 per cent. solution of sodium carbonate for thirty minutes.\r\n\r\n4. Cut each cylinder obliquely from end to end, forming two wedge-shaped\r\nportions.\r\n\r\n5. Place a small piece of sterilised cotton-wool, moistened with sterile\r\nwater, at the bottom of a sterile test-tube; insert the potato wedge\r\ninto the tube so that its base rests upon the cotton-wool. Now plug the\r\ntube with cotton-wool (Fig. 111).\r\n\r\n6. Sterilise in the steamer at 100 deg. C. for twenty minutes on each of\r\n_five_ consecutive days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 111.--Potato tube.]\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--The cork borer reserved for cutting the potato\r\n     cylinders should be silver electro-plated both inside and\r\n     out, and the knife used for dividing the cylinders should be\r\n     of silver or silver plated. When these precautions are\r\n     adopted the potato wedges will retain their white color and\r\n     will not show the discoloration so often observed when steel\r\n     instruments are employed.\r\n\r\n~Beer Wort.~--Wort is chiefly used as a medium for the cultivation of\r\nyeasts, moulds, etc., both in its fluid form and also when made solid by\r\nthe addition of gelatine or agar. The wort is prepared as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Weigh out 250 grammes crushed malt and place in a 2-litre flask.\r\n\r\n2. Add 1000 c.c. distilled water, heated to 70 deg. C., and close the\r\nflask with a rubber stopper.\r\n\r\n3. Place the flask in a water-bath regulated to 60 deg. C. and allow\r\nthe maceration to continue for one hour.\r\n\r\n4. Strain through butter muslin into a clean flask and heat in the\r\nsteamer for thirty minutes.\r\n\r\n5. Filter through Swedish filter paper.\r\n\r\n6. Tube in quantities of 10 c.c. or store in flasks.\r\n\r\n7. Sterilise in the steamer at 100 deg. C. for twenty minutes on each of\r\nthree consecutive days.\r\n\r\nThe natural reaction of the wort should _not_ be interfered with.\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--It is sometimes more convenient to obtain\r\n     \"_unhopped_\"[6] beer wort direct from the brewery. In this\r\n     case it is diluted with an equal quantity of distilled\r\n     water, steamed for an hour, filtered, filled into sterile\r\n     flasks or tubes, and sterilised by the discontinuous method.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Wort Gelatine.~--\r\n\r\n1. Measure out wort (prepared as above), 900 c.c., into a sterile flask.\r\n\r\n2. Weigh out gelatine, 100 grammes (= 10 per cent.), and add it to the\r\nwort in the flask.\r\n\r\n3. Bubble live steam through the mixture for ten minutes, to dissolve\r\nthe gelatine.\r\n\r\n4. Cool to 60 deg. C.; clarify with egg as for nutrient gelatine\r\n(_vide_ page 164).\r\n\r\n5. Filter through papier Chardin.\r\n\r\n6. Tube, and sterilise as for nutrient gelatine.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Wort Agar.~--\r\n\r\n1. Measure out wort (as above), 700 c.c., into a sterile flask.\r\n\r\n2. Weigh out powdered agar, 20 grammes; mix into a smooth paste with 200\r\nc.c. of cold wort and add to the wort in the flask.\r\n\r\n3. Bubble live steam through the mixture for twenty minutes, to dissolve\r\nthe agar.\r\n\r\n4. Cool to 60 deg. C.; clarify with egg as for nutrient agar (_vide_ page\r\n167).\r\n\r\n5. Filter through papier Chardin, using the hot-water funnel.\r\n\r\n6. Tube, and sterilise as for nutrient agar.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Peptone Water (Dunham).~--\r\n\r\n1. Weigh out Witte's peptone, 10 grammes, and salt, 5 grammes, and\r\nemulsify with about 250 c.c. of distilled water previously heated to\r\n60 deg. C.\r\n\r\n2. Pour the emulsion into a litre flask and make up to 1000 c.c. by the\r\naddition of distilled water.\r\n\r\n3. Heat in the steamer at 100 deg. C. for thirty minutes.\r\n\r\n4. Filter through Swedish filter paper.\r\n\r\n5. Tube in quantities of 10 c.c. each.\r\n\r\n6. Sterilise in the steamer at 100 deg. C. for twenty minutes on each of\r\nthree consecutive days.\r\n\r\n~\"Sugar\" or \"Carbohydrate\" Media.~--\r\n\r\nFormerly the ability of bacteria to induce hydrolytic changes in\r\ncarbohydrate substances was observed only in connection with a few\r\nwell-defined sugars, but of recent years it has been shown that when\r\nusing litmus as an indicator these so-called \"fermentation reactions\"\r\nfacilitate the differentiation of closely allied species, and the list\r\nof substances employed in this connection has been considerably\r\nextended. The media prepared with them are now no longer regarded as\r\nspecial, but are comprised in the \"stock media\" of the laboratory. The\r\nchief of these substances are the following, arranged in accordance with\r\ntheir chemical constitution:\r\n\r\n    _Monosaccharides_       Dextrose (glucose), laevulose, galactose,\r\n                              mannose, arabinose, xylose.\r\n    _Disaccharides_         Maltose, lactose, saccharose.\r\n    _Trisaccharides_        Raffinose (mellitose).\r\n    _Polysaccharides_       Dextrin, inulin, starch, glycogen, amidon.\r\n    _Glucosides_            Amygdalin, coniferin, salicin,\r\n                              helicin, phlorrhizin.\r\n    _Polyatomic alcohols_   _Trihydric_, Glycerin.\r\n                            _Tetrahydric_, Erythrite.\r\n                            _Pentahydric_, Adonite.\r\n                            _Hexahydric_, Dulcite, (dulcitol or\r\n                              melampirite), isodulcite (rhamnose),\r\n                              mannite (mannitol), sorbite (sorbitol),\r\n                              inosite.\r\n\r\nThese substances should be obtained from Kahlbaum (of Berlin); in the\r\npure form, and when possible as large crystals, and the method of\r\npreparing a medium containing either of them may be exemplified by\r\ndescribing Dextrose Solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Dextrose Solution.~--\r\n\r\n1. Weigh out\r\n\r\n    Peptone    20 grammes\r\n    Glucose    10 grammes\r\n\r\nand grind together in a mortar; then emulsify in 100 c.c. of distilled\r\nwater heated to 60 deg. C.\r\n\r\n2. Place in a flask and add\r\n\r\n    Distilled water   850 c.c.\r\n\r\n3. Steam in the steamer at 100 deg. C. for twenty minutes to dissolve\r\nthe peptone and glucose.\r\n\r\n4. Add\r\n\r\n    Kubel-Tiemann litmus solution (Kahlbaum)    50 c.c.\r\n\r\n(The substances enumerated above react acid to phenolphthalein, but\r\nvariously toward the neutral litmus solution. To such as react acid, add\r\nvery cautiously n/1 sodium hydrate solution to the medium in bulk until\r\nthe neutral tint has returned).\r\n\r\n5. Fill into tubes in which have previously been placed the inverted\r\nDurham's gas tubes.\r\n\r\n6. Sterilise in the steamer at 100 deg. C. for _twenty minutes_ on\r\neach of three successive days.\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--On no account should these media be sterilised in the\r\n     autoclave, as temperatures above 100 deg. C. themselves induce\r\n     hydrolytic changes in the substances in question. It is\r\n     equally important that the twenty minutes should not be\r\n     exceeded in sterilisation, as neglect of this precaution may\r\n     discolour the litmus or lead to the production of yellowish\r\n     tints when the tubes are subsequently inoculated with\r\n     acid-forming bacteria.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Neutral Litmus Solution.~\r\n\r\nThe most satisfactory is the Kubel-Tiemann, prepared by Kahlbaum. It can\r\nhowever be made in the laboratory as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Weigh out\r\n\r\n    Commercial litmus      50 grammes,\r\n\r\nand place in a well stoppered 500 c.c. bottle; measure out and add 300\r\nc.c. alcohol 95 per cent.\r\n\r\n2. Shake well at least once a day for seven days--the alcohol acquires a\r\ngreen colour.\r\n\r\n3. Decant off the green alcohol and fill a further 300 c.c. 95 per cent.\r\nalcohol into the bottle and repeat the shaking.\r\n\r\n4. Repeat this process until on adding fresh alcohol the fluid only\r\nbecomes tinged with violet.\r\n\r\n5. Pour off the alcohol, leaving the litmus as dry as possible. Connect\r\nup the bottle to an air pump and evaporate off the last traces of\r\nalcohol.\r\n\r\n6. Transfer the dry litmus to a litre flask, measure in 600 c.c.\r\ndistilled water and allow to remain in contact 24 hours with frequent\r\nshakings.\r\n\r\n7. Filter the solution into a clean flask and add one or two drops of\r\npure concentrated sulphuric acid until the litmus solution is distinctly\r\nwine-red in colour.\r\n\r\n8. Add excess of pure solid baryta and allow to stand until the reaction\r\nis again alkaline.\r\n\r\n9. Filter.\r\n\r\n10. Bubble CO_{2} through the solution until reaction is definitely\r\nacid.\r\n\r\n11. Sterilise in the steamer at 100 deg. C. for thirty minutes on each of\r\nthree consecutive days. This sterilises the solution and also drives off\r\nthe carbon dioxide, leaving the solution neutral.\r\n\r\n~Media for anaerobic cultures.~ In addition to the foregoing media, all of\r\nwhich can be, and are employed in the cultivation of anaerobic bacteria,\r\ncertain special media containing readily oxidised substances are\r\ncommonly used for this purpose. The principal of these are as follows:\r\n\r\n     ~Bile Salt Broth (MacConkey).~--\r\n\r\n     1.

Tube, and sterilise as for nutrient agar.\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--The Sulphindigotate media are of a blue colour, which\r\n     during the growth of anaerobic bacteria is oxidised and\r\n     decolourised to a light yellow.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[4] This figure is obtained by adding together 1 litre water, 1000\r\ngrammes; 10 per cent. gelatine, 100 grammes; 1 per cent. peptone, 10\r\ngrammes; 0.5 per cent. salt, 5 grammes; total, 1115 grammes.\r\nModifications of the above process, as to quantities and percentages,\r\nwill require corresponding alterations of the figures. The average\r\nweight of a measured litre of 10 per cent. nutrient gelatine when\r\nprepared in this way _after filtration_ is 1080 grammes.\r\n\r\n[5] This figure is obtained by adding together 1 litre of water (meat\r\nextract), 1000 grammes; 2 per cent. agar, 20 grammes; 1 per cent.\r\npeptone, 10 grammes; 0.5 per cent. salt, 5 grammes--total 1035 grammes.\r\nModifications of the process as to quantities or percentages will\r\nnecessitate corresponding alterations in the calculated medium figure.\r\nThe average weight of a measured litre of 2 per cent. agar when prepared\r\nin this way, _after filtration_, is 1010.5 grammes.\r\n\r\n[6] \"Hopped\" wort exerts a toxic effect upon many bacteria, including\r\nthe lactic acid bacteria.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII. SPECIAL MEDIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this chapter are collected a number of media which have been\r\nelaborated by various workers for special purposes, grouped together\r\nunder headings which indicate their chief utility. In many instances the\r\nname of the originator of the medium is given, but without reference to\r\nhis original instructions, since these are in many cases inadequate to\r\nthe requirements of the isolated worker, who would probably fail to\r\nreproduce the medium in a form giving the results attributed to it by\r\nits author. Such modifications have therefore been introduced as make\r\nfor uniformity between the different batches of media.\r\n\r\nA considerable number of coloured media, chiefly intended for work with\r\nintestinal bacteria, have been included; but beyond the fact that the\r\nauthor's modification of the Drigalski-Conradi medium has been included\r\namongst the routine media of the laboratory, no comment has been made\r\nupon their relative values, since only by observation and practice can\r\nthe skill necessary to utilise their full value be acquired.\r\n\r\nThe instructions as to sterilisation are rarely given in full; the\r\nroutine method of exposure in the steam steriliser at 100 deg. C. (without\r\npressure) for twenty minutes on each of three successive days for all\r\nfluid media, and thirty minutes on each of three successive days for all\r\nliquefiable or solid media must be carried out; and only when these\r\ngeneral rules are to be departed from are further details given.\r\n\r\n_Media for the Study of the Chemical Composition of Bacteria._\r\n\r\n\r\n~Asparagin Medium (Uschinsky).~--\r\n\r\n1.

Estimate the reaction of the medium and if necessary restore to +10.\r\n\r\n6. Inoculate the bouillon from a pure cultivation of the B. coli\r\ncommunis and incubate at 37 deg. C. for forty-eight hours.\r\n\r\n7. Heat in the steamer at 100 deg. C. for twenty minutes.\r\n\r\nNow fill two fermentation tubes with the bouillon, tint with litmus\r\nsolution, and sterilise; inoculate with B. lactis aerogenes. If no acid\r\nor gas is formed, the bouillon is in a sugar-free condition; but if acid\r\nor gas is present, again make the bouillon in the flask +10, reinoculate\r\nwith one or other of the above-mentioned bacteria, and incubate; then\r\ntest again. Repeat this till neither acid nor gas appears in the medium\r\nwhen used for the cultivation of either of the bacilli referred to\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n8. After the final heating, stand the flask in a cool place and allow\r\nthe growth to sediment. Filter the supernatant broth through Swedish\r\nfilter paper. If the filtrate is cloudy, filter through a porcelain\r\nfilter candle.\r\n\r\n9. Tube, and sterilise as for bouillon.\r\n\r\nBouillon prepared in the above-described manner will prove to be\r\nabsolutely sugar-free; and from it may be prepared nutrient sugar-free\r\ngelatine or agar, by dissolving in it the required percentage of\r\ngelatine or agar respectively and completing the medium according to\r\ndirections given on pages 166 and 167. The most important application of\r\ninosite-free bouillon is its use in the preparation of sugar bouillons,\r\nwhether glucose, maltose, lactose, or saccharose, of exact percentage\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Sugar (Dextrose) Bouillon.~--\r\n\r\n1.

Weigh out glucose (anhydrous), 20 grammes (= 2 per cent.), and\r\ndissolve in the fluid.\r\n\r\n3. Tube, and sterilise as for bouillon.\r\n\r\nOrdinary commercial glucose serves the purpose equally well, but is not\r\nrecommended, as during the process of sterilisation it causes the medium\r\nto gradually deepen in colour.\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--In certain cases a corresponding percentage of\r\n     lactose, maltose, or saccharose is substituted for glucose.\r\n\r\n~Sugar Gelatine.~--\r\n\r\n1.

INCUBATORS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 113.--Incubator.]\r\n\r\nAn incubator (Fig. 113) consists essentially of a chamber for the\r\nreception of cultivations, etc., surrounded by a water jacket, the walls\r\nof which are of metal, usually copper, and outside all an asbestos or\r\nfelt jacket, or wooden casing. The water in the jacket is heated by gas\r\nor electricity and maintained at some constant temperature by a\r\nthermo-regulator. The cellular incubator (Fig. 114) which was made for\r\nme[7] some years ago is of the greatest practical utility. Here the\r\ncentral cavity is subdivided by five double-walled partitions (in which\r\nwater circulates in connection with the water tanks at the top and base\r\nof the incubator) and again by iron shelves to form twenty-four pigeon\r\nholes. Into each of these slides an iron drawer 35 cm. long x 12 cm.\r\nwide x 22 cm. high forming a self-contained incubator. The drawer is\r\nfitted with a wooden form to which is fixed a handle and a numbered\r\nlabel. The thermo-regulating apparatus is the well-known Hearson\r\ncapsule.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 114.--Cellular incubator.]\r\n\r\nTwo incubators at least are required in the laboratory, for the\r\ncultivation of bacteria the one regulated to maintain a temperature of\r\n37 deg. C., and known as the \"hot\" incubator; the other, 20 deg. C. to\r\n22 deg. C., and known as the \"cool\" or \"cold\" incubator.\r\n\r\nTwo other incubators, regulated to 42 deg. C. and 60 deg. C. respectively,\r\nwhilst not absolutely, necessary very soon justify their purchase.\r\n\r\n~Thermo-regulators.~--The thermo-regulator is the most essential portion\r\nof the incubator, as upon its efficient working depends the maintenance\r\nof a constant temperature in the cultivation chamber. It is also used in\r\nthe fitting up of water and paraffin baths, and for many other purposes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 115.--Reichert's thermo-regulator.]\r\n\r\nOf the many forms and varieties of thermo-regulator (other than\r\nelectrical), two only are of sufficiently general use to need mention.\r\nIn one of these the flow of gas to the gas-jet is controlled by the\r\nexpansion or contraction of mercury within a glass bulb; in the other,\r\nby alterations in the position of the walls of a metallic capsule\r\ncontaining a fluid, the boiling-point of which corresponds to the\r\ntemperature at which the incubator is intended to act. They are:\r\n\r\n(a) _Reichert's_ (Fig. 115), consists of a bulb containing mercury\r\nwhich is to be suspended in the medium, whether air or water, the\r\ntemperature of which it is desired to regulate. Gas enters at A, and\r\npasses out to the jet by B. As the temperature rises the mercury expands\r\nand cuts off the main gas supply. As the temperature falls the mercury\r\ncontracts and reopens the narrow tube C. By means of a thumbscrew D\r\n(which mechanically raises or lowers the column of mercury irrespective\r\nof the temperature) and the aid of a thermometer the apparatus can be\r\nset to keep the incubator at any desired temperature. With this form a\r\nspecial gas burner is required, with separate supply of gas to a pilot\r\njet at the side.\r\n\r\n(b) _Hearson's capsule regulator_ consists of a metal capsule\r\nhermetically sealed and filled with a liquid which boils at the required\r\ntemperature, this is adjusted in the interior of the incubator. Soldered\r\nto the upper side of the capsule is a thick piece of metal having a\r\ncentral cup to receive the lower end of a rigid rod, through which the\r\nmovements of the walls of the capsule are transmitted to the gas valve\r\nfixed outside the incubator.\r\n\r\nThe gas valve or governor is shown in figure 116. A is the inlet for\r\ngas, C the outlet to burner heating the water jacket, B D a lever\r\npivoted to standards at G, and acted upon by the capsule, through the\r\nrigid rod which enters the socket below the screw P.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 116.--Capsule thermo-regulator.]\r\n\r\nThe construction of the valve is such that, whenever the short arm of\r\nthe lever B D presses on the disc below the end B, the main supply of\r\ngas is entirely cut off. At such times, however, a very small portion of\r\ngas passes from A to C, through an aperture inside the valve, the size\r\nof which aperture can be adjusted by the screw needle S, hence the gas\r\nflame below the incubator is never extinguished.\r\n\r\nThe expansion of the metal walls of the capsule, which takes place upon\r\nthe boiling of its contents, provides the motive force, transmitted\r\nthrough the rigid rod to raise the long arm of the lever B D, and as\r\nthis expansion only takes place at a predetermined temperature, the\r\nlever will only be acted upon when the critical temperature is reached,\r\nno sensible effect being produced at even 1 deg. C. below that at which\r\nthe capsule is destined to act.\r\n\r\nW is a weight sliding on the lever rod D; by increasing the distance\r\nbetween the weight and the fulcrum of the lower increased pressure is\r\nbrought to bear upon the walls of the capsule with the result that the\r\nboiling-point of the liquid in the capsule is slightly raised, and a\r\nrange of about two degrees can thus be obtained with any particular\r\ncapsule.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[7] Made by the firm of Chas. Hearson & Co., 235 Regent St., London, W.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV. METHODS OF CULTIVATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nCultivations of micro-organisms are usually prepared in the laboratory\r\nin one of three ways:\r\n\r\n    ~Tube cultures.~\r\n    ~Plate cultures.~\r\n    ~Hanging-drop cultures.~\r\n\r\nThese may be incubated either ~aerobically~ (i. e., in the presence of\r\noxygen) or ~anaerobically~ (i. e., in the absence of oxygen, or in the\r\npresence of an indifferent gas, such as hydrogen, nitrogen, or carbon\r\ndioxide).\r\n\r\nWith regard to the temperature at which the cultivations are grown, it\r\nmay be stated as a general rule that all media rendered solid by the\r\naddition of gelatine are incubated at 20 deg. C., or at any rate at a\r\ntemperature not exceeding 22 deg. C. (that is, in the \"cold\" incubator);\r\nwhilst fluid media and all other solid media are incubated at 37 deg. C.\r\n(that is, in the \"hot\" incubator). Exceptions to this rule are numerous.\r\nFor instance, in studying the growth of the psychrophylic bacteria, the\r\nyeasts and the moulds, the cold incubator is employed for all media.\r\n\r\nTube cultivations are usually packed in the incubator in small tin\r\ncylinders, such as those in which American cigarettes are sold, or in\r\nsquare tin boxes. Beakers or tumblers may be used for the same purpose,\r\nbut being fragile are not so convenient. Metal test-tube racks, long\r\nenough to just fit into the interior of the incubator and each\r\naccommodating two rows of tubes, are also exceedingly useful.\r\n\r\n\r\n~AEROBIC.~\r\n\r\n~The Preparation of Tube Cultivations.~\r\n\r\n\r\nThe preparation of a tube cultivation consists in:\r\n\r\n(a) Inoculating a tube of sterile nutrient medium with a portion of\r\nthe material to be examined.\r\n\r\n(b) Incubating the inoculated tube at a suitable temperature.\r\n\r\nThe details of the first of these processes must be varied somewhat\r\naccording to whether the tubes of nutrient media are inoculated or\r\n\"planted\" from--\r\n\r\n1. Pre-existing cultivations.\r\n\r\n2. Morbid material previously collected (_vide_ page 373).\r\n\r\n3. Fluids, tissues, etc., or from the animal body direct.\r\n\r\nThe method of preparing tube cultivations from pre-existing cultivations\r\nis as follows:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 117.--Inoculating tubes, seen from the front.]\r\n\r\n~1. Fluid Media~ (e. g., Nutrient Bouillon).--\r\n\r\n1. Flame the cotton-wool plug of the tube containing the cultivation and\r\nalso that of the tube of sterile bouillon.\r\n\r\n2. Hold the two tubes, side by side, between the left thumb and the\r\nfirst and third fingers, allowing the sealed ends to rest on the dorsum\r\nof the hand, and separating the mouths of the tubes (which are pointed\r\nto the right) by the tip of the second finger. Keep the tubes as nearly\r\nhorizontal as is possible without allowing the fluid in the bouillon\r\ntube to reach the cotton-wool plug (Fig. 117).\r\n\r\n3. Sterilise the platinum loop and allow it to cool.[8]\r\n\r\n4. Grasp the plug of the tube containing the cultivation between the\r\nlittle finger and palm of the hand and remove it from the tube.\r\n\r\n5. Grasp the plug of the bouillon tube between the fourth finger and the\r\nball of the thumb and remove it from the tube.\r\n\r\n6. Pass the platinum loop into the tube containing the culture--do not\r\nallow the loop to touch the sides of the tube, or the handle to touch\r\nthe medium--and remove a small portion of the growth; withdraw the loop\r\nfrom the tube, keeping the infected side of the loop downward.\r\n\r\n7. Pass the loop into the bouillon tube almost down to the level of the\r\nfluid, reverse the loop so that the infected side faces upward, emulsify\r\nthe portion of the growth in the moisture adhering to the side of the\r\ntube which is uppermost. Withdraw the loop.\r\n\r\n8. Replug both tubes.\r\n\r\n9. Sterilise the platinum loop.\r\n\r\n10. Label the bouillon tube with (a) the name of the organism and\r\n(b) the date of inoculation.\r\n\r\n11. Incubate.\r\n\r\n~2. Solid Media.~--Solid media are stored in tubes in one of two ways:\r\n\r\n1. Oblique tube or slanted tube (Fig. 118), in which the medium has been\r\nallowed to solidify whilst the tube was retained in an inclined\r\nposition, so forming an extensive surface of medium extending from the\r\nbottom of the tube almost to its mouth.\r\n\r\nThis is employed for \"streak\" or \"smear\" cultivations (_Strichcultur_).\r\n\r\n2. Straight tube (Fig. 119), in which the medium forms a cylindrical\r\nmass in the lower portion of the tube and presents an upper surface\r\nwhich is at right angles to the long axis of the tube.\r\n\r\nThis is employed for \"stab\" or \"stick\" cultivations (_Stichcultur_), or\r\nby inoculating the medium whilst fluid, and allowing to solidify in this\r\nposition, for \"shake\" cultivations.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Streak Culture._--\r\n\r\n1. Flame the plugs, sterilise the platinum loop (or spatula). Open the\r\ntubes and charge the loop as in previous inoculation.\r\n\r\n2. Pass the infected loop to the bottom of the tube to be inoculated and\r\ndraw it, as lightly as possible, along the centre of the surface of the\r\nmedium, terminating the \"streak\" over the thin layer of medium near the\r\nmouth of the tube.\r\n\r\n3. Replug the tubes, sterilise the platinum loop.\r\n\r\n4. Label the newly inoculated tube and incubate.\r\n\r\n_Smear Culture._--Proceed generally as in streak culture, but rub the\r\ninfected loop all over the surface of the medium, instead of restricting\r\nthe inoculation to a narrow line.\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--Gelatine and agar oblique tubes should be freshly\r\n     \"slanted\" before use.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Stab Culture._--\r\n\r\n1. Flame the plugs, open the tubes, sterilise the platinum needle and\r\ncharge it with the inoculum as in the previous cultivations.\r\n\r\n2. Pass the platinum needle into the tube to be inoculated until it\r\ntouches the centre of the surface of the medium. Now thrust it deeply\r\ninto the substance of the medium, keeping the needle as nearly as\r\npossible in the axis of the cylinder of medium. Then withdraw the\r\nneedle.\r\n\r\n3. Replug the tubes. Sterilise the platinum needle.\r\n\r\n4. Label the newly planted tube and incubate.\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--When gelatine is stored for some time the upper\r\n     surface of the cylinder becomes concave owing to\r\n     evaporation. Tubes showing this appearance should be\r\n     liquefied and again allowed to set before use for stab\r\n     culture, otherwise when the needle enters the medium, the\r\n     surface tension will cause the gelatine cylinder to split.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 118.--Sloped or slanted medium for streak or smear\r\nculture.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 119.--Straight tube.]\r\n\r\n_Shake Culture._--\r\n\r\n1. Liquefy a tube of nutrient gelatine (or agar, or other similar\r\nmedium), by heating in a water-bath (Fig. 121).\r\n\r\n2. Inoculate the liquefied medium and label it, etc., precisely as if\r\ndealing with a tube of bouillon.\r\n\r\n3. Place the newly planted tube in the upright position (e. g., in a\r\ntest-tube rack) and allow it to solidify.\r\n\r\n4. Label the tube; when solid, incubate.\r\n\r\n     _Esmarch's Roll Cultivation._--\r\n\r\n     1. Liquefy three tubes of gelatine by heat.\r\n\r\n     2. Prepare three dilutions of the inoculum (as described for\r\n     plate cultivations, page 228, steps 4 to 7).\r\n\r\n     3. Roll the tubes, held almost horizontally, in a groove\r\n     made in a block of ice, until the gelatine has set in a thin\r\n     film on the inner surface of tube (Fig. 120); or under the\r\n     cold-water tap.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: FIG. 120. Esmarch's roll culture on block of\r\n     ice.]\r\n\r\n     In order that the medium may adhere firmly to the glass, the\r\n     agar used for roll cultivation should have 1 per cent.\r\n     gelatine or 1 per cent. gum arabic added to it before\r\n     sterilisation.\r\n\r\n     Roll cultivations, which served a most important purpose in\r\n     the days before the introduction of Petri dishes for plate\r\n     cultivations, are now obsolete in modern laboratories and\r\n     are merely mentioned for the benefit of students, since\r\n     examiners who are interested in the academic and historical\r\n     aspects of bacteriology sometimes expect candidates to be\r\n     acquainted with the method of preparing them.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Preparation of Plate Cultures.\r\n\r\nIf a small number of bacteria are suspended in liquefied gelatine, agar,\r\nor other similar medium, and the infected medium spread out in an even\r\nlayer over a flat surface and allowed to solidify, each individual\r\nmicro-organism becomes fixed to a certain spot and its further\r\ndevelopment is restricted to the vicinity of this spot. After a variable\r\ninterval the growth of this organism becomes visible to the naked eye\r\nas a \"colony.\" This is the principle upon which the method of plate\r\ncultivation is based and its practice enables the bacteriologist to\r\nstudy the particular manner of development affected by each species of\r\nmicrobe when growing (a) unrestricted upon the surface of the medium,\r\n(b) in the depths of the medium. The method itself is as follows:\r\n\r\n     ~Apparatus Required.~--\r\n\r\n     1. Tripod levelling stand.\r\n\r\n     2. Large shallow glass dish, with a square sheet of plate\r\n     glass to cover it.\r\n\r\n     3. Spirit level.\r\n\r\n     4. Case of sterile Petri dishes.\r\n\r\n     5. Tubes of sterile nutrient media, gelatine (or agar)\r\n     previously liquefied by heating in the water-bath and cooled\r\n     to 42 deg. C., otherwise the heat of the medium would destroy\r\n     many, if not all, of the bacteria introduced.\r\n\r\n     6. Tube of cultivation to be planted from.\r\n\r\n     7. Platinum loop.\r\n\r\n     8. Bunsen burner.\r\n\r\n     9. Grease pencil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 121.--Handy form of water-bath for melting tubes of\r\nagar and gelatine previous to slanting them; or to making shake cultures\r\nor pouring plates.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMethod of \"Pouring\" Plates.--\r\n\r\n1. Place the glass dish on the levelling tripod (Figs. 122, 123); if\r\ngelatine plates are to be poured fill the dish with ice water--gelatine\r\nsolidifies so slowly that it is necessary to hasten the process; if agar\r\nis to be used fill with water at 50 deg. C.--agar sets almost immediately\r\nat the room temperature and by slightly retarding the process lumpiness\r\nis avoided; cover the dish with the square sheet of glass.\r\n\r\n2. Place the spirit level on the sheet of glass and by means of the\r\nlevelling screws adjust the surface of the glass to the horizontal.\r\n\r\nThis leveling is an important matter since the development of a colony\r\nis to some extent proportionate to the supply of medium available for\r\nits nutrition. Thus in a \"smear\" on sloped tube culture, the colonies at\r\nthe upper part of the medium are stunted and small but increase in size\r\nand luxuriance of growth the nearer they approach to the bottom of the\r\ntube, where there is the greatest depth of medium.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 122.--Plate-levelling stand.]\r\n\r\n3. Place three sterile Petri dishes in a row on the surface of the glass\r\nplate and number them 1, 2, and 3, from left to right.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 123.--Plate-levelling stand, side view.]\r\n\r\n4. Number the previously liquefied tubes of nutrient media 1, 2, and 3.\r\nFlame the plugs and see that each plug can be readily removed from the\r\nmouth of its tube.\r\n\r\n5. Add one loopful of the inoculum to tube No. 1, treating the\r\nliquefied medium as bouillon. After replugging, grasp the tube near its\r\nmouth by the thumb and first finger of the right hand, and with an even\r\ncircular movement of the whole arm, diffuse the inoculum throughout the\r\nmedium; avoid jerky movements, as these cause bubbles of air to form in\r\nthe medium.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 124.--Mixing emulsion for plates.]\r\n\r\nThe knack of mixing evenly without producing air bubbles, is not always\r\neasily acquired, by this method. An alternative plan is to hold the\r\ninoculated tube vertically upright between the opposed palms and to\r\nrotate it between them by rapid backward and forward movements of the\r\ntwo hands (Fig. 124).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 125.--Pouring plates.]\r\n\r\n6. Sterilise the platinum loop, and add two loopfuls of diluted inoculum\r\nto tube No. 2, and mix as before.\r\n\r\n7. In a similar manner transfer three loopfuls of liquefied medium from\r\ntube No. 2 to tube No. 3, and mix thoroughly.\r\n\r\n8. Flame the plug of tube No. 1, remove it, then flame the lips of the\r\ntube; slightly raise the cover of Petri dish No. 1, introduce the mouth\r\nof the tube; then, elevating the bottom of the tube, pour the liquefied\r\nmedium into the Petri dish, to form a thin layer. Remove the mouth of\r\nthe tube and close the \"plate.\" If the medium has failed to flow evenly\r\nover the bottom of the plate, raise the plate from the levelling\r\nplatform and by tilting in different directions rectify the fault.\r\n\r\n9. Pour plates No. 2 and No. 3, in a similar manner, from tubes Nos. 2\r\nand 3.\r\n\r\n10. Label the plates with the distinctive name or number of the\r\ninoculum, also the date; the number of the dilution having been\r\npreviously indicated (step 3).\r\n\r\n11. Place in the cool incubator for three or more days, as may be\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nIn this way colonies may be obtained quite pure and separate from each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nIn plate No. 1, probably, the colonies will be so numerous and crowded,\r\nand therefore so small, as to render it useless. In plate No. 2 they\r\nwill be more widely separated, but usually No. 3 is the plate reserved\r\nfor careful examination, as in this the colonies are usually widely\r\nseparated, few in number, and large in size.\r\n\r\n_Agar plates_ are poured in a similar manner, but the agar must be\r\nmelted in boiling water and then allowed to cool to 45 deg. C. or 42 deg.\r\nC. in a carefully regulated water-bath before being inoculated, and the\r\nentire process must be carried out very rapidly, otherwise the agar will\r\nhave solidified before the operation is completed.\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--In pouring plates, since tube No. 1 (for the first\r\n     dilution) rarely gives a plate that is of any practical\r\n     value it is frequently replaced by a tube of bouillon or\r\n     sterile salt solution, and in such case plate No. 1 is not\r\n     poured.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Surface Plates.~--\r\n\r\nThis method of pouring what may be termed \"whole\" plates (since colonies\r\nmay appear both on the surface and in the depths of the medium) is\r\nessential to the accurate study of the formation of colonies under\r\nvarious conditions, but when the main object of the separation of the\r\nbacteria is to obtain subcultivations from a number of individual\r\nbacteria, \"surface\" plates must be prepared, since here colony formation\r\nis restricted to the surface of the medium. The method adopted varies\r\nslightly according to whether the medium employed is gelatine or agar,\r\nor one of the derivatives or variants of the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\n(a) ~Gelatine Surface Plates.~--\r\n\r\n1. Liquefy three tubes of nutrient gelatine.\r\n\r\n2. Pour each tube into a separate Petri dish and allow it to solidify.\r\nThen turn each plate and its cover upside down.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 126.--Surface plate spreader.]\r\n\r\n3. When quite cold raise the bottom of plate 1, revert it and deposit a\r\ndrop of the inoculum (whether a fluid culture or an emulsion from solid\r\nculture) upon the surface of the gelatine with a platinum loop--close to\r\none side of the plate; replace the bottom half of the Petri dish in its\r\ncover.\r\n\r\n4. Take a piece of thin glass rod, stout platinum wire or best of all a\r\npiece of aluminium wire (say 2 mm. diameter) about 28 cm. long. Bend the\r\nterminal 4 cm. at right angles to the remainder, making an L-shaped rod\r\n(Fig. 126). Sterilise the short arm and adjacent portion of the long\r\narm, in the Bunsen flame, and allow it to cool.\r\n\r\n5. Now raise the bottom of the Petri dish in the left hand, leaving the\r\ncover on the laboratory bench, and holding it vertically, smear the drop\r\nof inoculum all over the surface of the gelatine with the short arm of\r\nthe spreader by a rotatory motion, (Fig. 127). Replace the dish in its\r\ncover.\r\n\r\n6. Raise the bottom of plate 2 and rub the infected spreader all over\r\nthe surface of the gelatine--then go on in like manner to the third\r\nplate in the series.\r\n\r\n7. Sterilise the spreader.\r\n\r\n8. Label and incubate the plates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 127.--Spreading surface plate.]\r\n\r\nAfter incubation, plate No. 1 will probably yield an enormous number of\r\ncolonies; plate 2 will show fewer colonies, since only those bacteria\r\nadhering to the rod after rubbing over plate 1 would be deposited on its\r\nsurface, and by the time the rod reached plate 3 but very few organisms\r\nshould remain upon it. So that the third plate as a rule will only show\r\na very few scattered colonies, eminently suitable for detailed study.\r\n\r\n\r\n(b) ~Agar Surface Plates.~--\r\n\r\n1. Liquefy three tubes of nutrient agar--nutrose agar or the like.\r\n\r\n2. Pour each tube into a separate Petri dish and allow it to solidify.\r\n\r\n3. When quite solid invert each dish, raise the bottom half and rest it\r\nobliquely on its inverted cover (Fig. 128) and place it in this position\r\nin an incubator at 60 deg. C. for forty-five minutes (or in an incubator\r\nat 42 deg. C. for two hours). This evaporates the water of condensation\r\nand gives the medium a firm, dry surface.\r\n\r\n4. On removing the plates from the incubator close each dish and place\r\nit--still upside down--on the laboratory bench.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 128.--Drying surface plate of agar.]\r\n\r\n5. Inoculate the plates in series of three, as described for gelatine\r\nsurface plates 3-8.\r\n\r\n\r\nHanging-drop Cultivation.\r\n\r\n    ~Apparatus Required.~--\r\n\r\n    Hanging-drop slides.\r\n    Cover-slips.\r\n    Section rack (Fig. 75).\r\n    Blotting paper.\r\n    Bell glass to cover slides.\r\n    Original culture.\r\n    Tubes of broth, or liquefied gelatine or agar.\r\n    Forceps.\r\n    Platinum loop.\r\n    Bunsen burner.\r\n    Grease pencil.\r\n    Sterile vaseline.\r\n    Lysol.\r\n\r\n\r\n(a) ~Fluid Media.~--\r\n\r\n1. Prepare first and second dilutions of the inoculum as directed for\r\nplate cultivations (_vide_ pages 228-229, sections 4 to 6), substituting\r\ntubes of nutrient broth for the liquefied gelatine.\r\n\r\n2. Sterilise a hanging-drop slide by washing thoroughly in water and\r\ndrying, then plunging it into a beaker of absolute alcohol, draining off\r\nthe greater part of the spirit, grasping the slide in a pair of forceps,\r\nand burning off the remainder of the alcohol in the flame.\r\n\r\n3. Place the hanging-drop slide on a piece of blotting paper moistened\r\nwith 2 per cent. lysol solution and cover it with a small bell glass\r\nthat has been rinsed out with the same solution and _not dried_.\r\n\r\n4. Raise the bell glass slightly and smear sterile vaseline around the\r\nrim of the metal cell by means of a sterile spatula of stout platinum\r\nwire.\r\n\r\n5. Remove a clean cover-slip from the alcohol pot with sterile forceps\r\nand burn off the alcohol; again raise the bell glass and place the\r\nsterile cover-slip on the blotting paper by the side of the hanging-drop\r\nslide.\r\n\r\n6. Remove a drop of the broth from the second dilution tube with a large\r\nplatinum loop; raise the bell glass and deposit the drop on the centre\r\nof the cover-slip. Sterilise the loop.\r\n\r\n7. Raise the bell glass sufficiently to allow of the cover-slip being\r\ngrasped with forceps, inverted, and adjusted over the cell of the\r\nhanging-drop slide. Remove the bell glass altogether and press the\r\ncover-slip firmly on to the cell.\r\n\r\n8. Either incubate and examine at definite intervals, or observe\r\ncontinuously with the microscope, using a warm stage if necessary (Fig.\r\n53).\r\n\r\n(b) ~Solid Media.~--Observing precisely similar technique, a few drops of\r\nliquefied gelatine or agar from the second dilution tube may be run over\r\nthe surface of the sterile cover-slip and a hanging-drop plate\r\ncultivation thereby prepared.\r\n\r\nThis method is extremely useful in connection with the study of yeasts,\r\nwhen the circular cell on the hanging-drop slide should be replaced by a\r\nrectangular cell some 38 by 19 mm., and the gelatine spread over a\r\ncover-slip of similar size. After sealing down the preparation, the\r\nupper surface of the cover-slip may be ruled into squares by the aid of\r\nthe grease pencil or a writing diamond and numbered to facilitate the\r\nsubsequent identification of the colonies which are observed to develop\r\nfrom solitary germs.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Hanging-block Culture~ (Hill).--\r\n\r\n_Apparatus required_: As for hanging-drop cultivation with the addition\r\nof a scalpel.\r\n\r\nCarry out the method as far as possible under cover of a bell glass, to\r\navoid aerial contamination.\r\n\r\n1. Liquefy a tube of nutrient agar (or gelatine) and pour into a Petri\r\ndish to the depth of about 4 mm. and allow to set.\r\n\r\n2. With a sharp scalpel cut out a block some 8 mm. square, from the\r\nentire thickness of the agar layer.\r\n\r\n3. Raise the agar block on the blade of the scalpel and transfer it,\r\nunder side down, to the centre of a sterile slide.\r\n\r\n4. Spread a drop of fluid cultivation (or an emulsion of growth from a\r\nsolid medium) over the upper surface of the agar block as if making a\r\ncover-slip film.\r\n\r\n5. Place the slide and block covered by the bell glass in the incubator\r\nat 37 deg. C. for ten minutes to dry slightly.\r\n\r\n6. Take a clean dry sterile cover-slip in a pair of forceps, and with\r\nthe help of a second pair of forceps lower it carefully on the\r\ninoculated surface of the agar (avoiding air bubbles), so as to leave a\r\nclear margin of cover-slip overlapping the agar block.\r\n\r\n7. Invert the preparation and with the blade of the scalpel remove the\r\nslide from the agar block.\r\n\r\n8. With a platinum loop run a drop or two of melted agar around the\r\nedges of the block. This solidifies at once and seals the block to the\r\ncover-slip.\r\n\r\n9. Prepare a sterile hanging-drop slide, and smear hard vaseline or\r\nmelted white wax on the rim of the metal cell.\r\n\r\n10. Invert the cover-slip with the block attached on to the hanging-drop\r\nslide, and seal the cover-slip firmly in place.\r\n\r\n11. Observe as for hanging-drop cultivations.\r\n\r\n\r\nANAEROBIC CULTIVATIONS.\r\n\r\nNumerous methods have been devised for the cultivation of anaerobic\r\nbacteria, the majority requiring the employment of special apparatus.\r\nThe principle upon which any method is based and upon which it depends\r\nfor its success falls under one or another of the following headings:\r\n\r\n(a) ~Exclusion of air~ from the cultivation.\r\n\r\n(b) ~Exhaustion of air~ from the vessel containing the cultivation by\r\nmeans of an air pump--i. e., cultivation _in vacuo_.\r\n\r\n(c) ~Absorption of oxygen~ from the air in contact with the cultivation\r\nby means of pyrogallic acid rendered alkaline with caustic soda--i. e.,\r\ncultivation in an atmosphere of nitrogen.\r\n\r\n(d) ~Displacement of air~ by an indifferent gas, such as hydrogen or coal\r\ngas--i. e., cultivation in an atmosphere of hydrogen.\r\n\r\n(e) A combination of two or more of the above methods.\r\n\r\nA selection of the simplest and most generally useful methods is given\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nWhenever possible, the nutrient media that are employed in any of the\r\nprocesses should contain some easily oxidisable substance, such as\r\nsodium formate (0.4 per cent.) or sodium sulphindigotate (0.1 per\r\ncent.), which will absorb all the available oxygen held in solution by\r\nthe medium. The further addition of glucose, 2 per cent., favors the\r\ngrowth of anaerobic bacteria (_vide_, pages 189-190).\r\n\r\nFurther, it is advisable to seal all joints between india-rubber\r\nstoppers and tubulures or the mouths of the tubes with melted paraffin;\r\nglass stoppers and taps should be lubricated with resin ointment or a\r\nmixture of beeswax 1 part, olive oil 4 parts.\r\n\r\n\r\n(A) ~Method I~ (Hesse's Method).--\r\n\r\n1. Make a stab culture in gelatine or agar, choosing for the purpose a\r\nstraight tube containing a deep column of medium, and thrusting the\r\ninoculating needle to the bottom of the tube.\r\n\r\n2. Pour a layer of sterilised oil (olive oil, vaseline, or petroleum), 1\r\nor 2 cm. deep, upon the surface of the medium.\r\n\r\n3. Incubate.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Method II.~--This method is only available when dealing with pure\r\ncultivations.\r\n\r\n1. Liquefy a tube of gelatine (or agar) by heat, pour it into a Petri\r\ndish, and allow it to solidify.\r\n\r\n2. Inoculate the surface of the medium in one spot only.\r\n\r\n3. Remove a cover-slip from the pot of absolute alcohol with sterile\r\nforceps; burn off the alcohol in the gas flame.\r\n\r\n4. Lower the now sterile cover-slip carefully on to the inoculated\r\nsurface of the medium, carefully excluding air bubbles, and press it\r\ndown firmly with the points of the forceps. (A sterile disc of mica may\r\nbe substituted for the cover-slip.)\r\n\r\n5. Incubate.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Method III~ (Roux's Physical Method).--\r\n\r\n1. Prepare tube cultures of fluid media (or solid media rendered fluid\r\nby heat) in the usual way.\r\n\r\n2. Aspirate some of the inoculated media into capillary pipettes.\r\n\r\n3. Seal both ends of each pipette in the blowpipe flame.\r\n\r\n4. Incubate.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Method IV~ (Roux's Biological Method).--\r\n\r\n1. Plant a deep stab, as in method I.\r\n\r\n2. Pour a layer, 1 or 2 cm. deep, of broth cultivation of a vigourous\r\naerobe--e. g., B. aquatilis sulcatus or B. prodigiosus--upon the\r\nsurface of the medium; or an equal depth of liquefied gelatine, which is\r\nthen inoculated with the aerobic organism.\r\n\r\n3. Incubate.\r\n\r\nThe growth of the aerobe will use up all the oxygen that reaches it and\r\nwill not allow any to pass through to the medium below, which will\r\nconsequently remain in an anaerobic condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n(B) ~Method V.~--\r\n\r\n1. Prepare tube or flask cultivations in the usual way.\r\n\r\n2. Replace the cotton-wool plug by an india-rubber stopper perforated\r\nwith one hole and fitted with a length of glass tubing which has a\r\nconstriction about 3 cm. above the stopper and is then bent at right\r\nangles (Fig. 129). The stopper and glass tubing are sterilised by being\r\nboiled in a beaker of water for five minutes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 129.--Vacuum culture.]\r\n\r\n3. Connect the tube leading from the culture vessel with a water or air\r\npump, interposing a Wulff's bottle fitted as a wash-bottle and\r\ncontaining sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\n4. Exhaust the air from the culture vessel.\r\n\r\n5. Before disconnecting the apparatus, seal the glass tube from the\r\nculture vessel at the constriction, using the blowpipe flame.\r\n\r\n6. Incubate.\r\n\r\n\r\n(C) ~Method VI~ (Buchner's Method).\r\n\r\n~Apparatus and Solutions Required.~--\r\n\r\n     Buchner's tube (a stout glass test-tube 23 cm. long and 4\r\n     cm. in diameter, fitted with india-rubber stopper, Fig.\r\n     130).\r\n\r\n     Pyrogallic acid in compressed tablets each containing 1\r\n     gram.\r\n\r\n     Dekanormal solution of caustic soda.\r\n\r\nMETHOD.--\r\n\r\n1. Prepare the tube cultivation in the usual way.\r\n\r\n2. Moisten the india-rubber stopper of the Buchner's tube with water and\r\nsee that it fits the mouth of the tube accurately.\r\n\r\n3. Remove the stopper from the caustic soda bottle.\r\n\r\n4. Drop one of the pyrogallic acid tablets[9] into the Buchner's tube\r\n(roughly, use 1 gramme pyrogallic acid for every 100 c.c. air capacity\r\nof the receiving vessel).\r\n\r\n5. Add about 1 c.c. of the soda solution.\r\n\r\n6. Place the inoculated tube inside the Buchner's tube. The pyrogallic\r\ntablet acts as a buffer and prevents damage to either the inoculated\r\ntube or the Buchner's tube even should it be slipped in hurriedly.\r\n\r\n7. Fit the india-rubber stopper tightly into the mouth of the Buchner's\r\ntube.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 130.--Buchner's tube.]\r\n\r\nThe pyrogallic acid tablet dissolves slowly in the soda solution and its\r\noxidation proceeds very slowly at first so that ample time is available\r\nwhen this method is adopted.\r\n\r\n8. Restopper the caustic soda bottle.\r\n\r\n9. Place Buchner's tube in a wire support, and incubate.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Method VII~ (Wright's Method).--\r\n\r\n1. Prepare tube cultivation in the usual way.\r\n\r\n2. Cut off that portion of the cotton-wool plug projecting above the\r\nmouth of the tube with scissors, then push the plug into the tube for a\r\ndistance of 2 or 3 cm.\r\n\r\n3. By means of a pipette drop about 1 c.c. of pyrogallic acid 10 per\r\ncent. aqueous solution on to the plug. It will immediately be absorbed\r\nby the cotton-wool.\r\n\r\n4. With another pipette run in an equal quantity of the caustic soda\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\n5. Quickly close the mouth of the tube with a tightly fitting\r\nindia-rubber stopper.\r\n\r\n6. Incubate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 131.--McLeod's anaerobic plate base with half petri\r\ndish inverted _in situ_]\r\n\r\n\r\n~Method VIII~ (McLeod's Method).--\r\n\r\n~Apparatus and Solutions Required.~--\r\n\r\n     McLeod's plate base (a hollow glazed earthenware disc 9 cm.\r\n     in diameter and 2 cm. deep: the upper surface is pierced by\r\n     a central hole, 2 cm. in diameter, giving access to the\r\n     interior, the lower part of which is divided into two by a\r\n     low partition. A shallow groove encircles the upper surface\r\n     near to the edge).\r\n\r\n    Plasticine.\r\n    Pyrogallic acid (1 gramme) compressed tablets.\r\n    Sodic hydroxide (0.4 gramme) compressed tablets.\r\n    Wash bottle of distilled water.\r\n    Surface plates of one or other agar medium (in petri dishes\r\n      of 8 cm. diameter).\r\n    Surface plate spreader.\r\n\r\nMETHOD.--\r\n\r\n1. Roll out a long cylinder of plasticine and fit it into the groove on\r\nthe upper surface of the earthenware base.\r\n\r\n2. Place a tablet of pyrogallic acid in one division of the interior of\r\nthe plate base, and two tablets of sodic hydroxide in the other.\r\n\r\n3. Prepare surface plate culture of the organism to be cultivated.\r\n\r\n4. Run a few cubic centimetres of distilled water into that division of\r\nthe plate base containing the sodic hydroxide.\r\n\r\n5. Invert the bottom half of the surface plate over the plate base and\r\npress its edges firmly down into the plasticine filling the groove.\r\n\r\n6. Label and incubate.\r\n\r\n\r\n(D) ~Method IX.~--\r\n\r\n~Apparatus Required.~--\r\n\r\n    Small Ruffer's or Woodhead's flask (Fig. 33).\r\n    Sterile india-rubber stopper.\r\n    India-rubber tubing.\r\n    Glass tubing.\r\n    Metal screw clips.\r\n    Cylinder of compressed hydrogen; or hydrogen gas apparatus\r\n\r\nMETHOD.--\r\n\r\n1. Sterilise a glass vessel, shaped as in a Ruffer's or Woodhead's\r\nflask, in the hot-air oven. (The tubulure and the side tubes are plugged\r\nwith cotton-wool.) After sterilisation, fix a short piece of rubber\r\ntubing occluded by a metal clip to each side tube.\r\n\r\n2. Inoculate a large quantity (e. g., 200 c.c.) of the medium. Where\r\nsolid media are employed they must first be liquefied by heat.\r\n\r\n3. Remove the cotton-wool plug from the tubulure and pour the inoculated\r\nmedium into the glass vessel.\r\n\r\n4. Close the tubulure by means of an india-rubber stopper previously\r\nsterilised by boiling in a beaker of water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 132.--Kipp's hydrogen apparatus, (a) connected up\r\nto two washing bottles containing (b) lead acetate 10 per cent.\r\nsolution, to remove H_{2}S and (c) silver nitrate solution to remove\r\nAsH_{3}. A third washing bottle containing pyrogallic acid 10 per cent.\r\nsolution, rendered alkaline, to remove any trace of oxygen, is sometimes\r\nintroduced.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 133.--Improved gas apparatus; the metal is contained\r\nin a perforated glass tube which is submerged in acid when the\r\ntriangular bottle is upright (a), but is above the level of the liquid\r\nwhen the bottle is turned on its side (b).]\r\n\r\n5. Connect up the india-rubber tubing on one of the side tubes with a\r\ncylinder of compressed hydrogen (or the delivery tube of a Kipp's Fig.\r\n132 or other hydrogen apparatus, Fig. 133), interposing a short piece of\r\nglass tubing; and in like manner connect a long piece of rubber tubing\r\nwhich should be led into a basin of water, to the opposite side tube.\r\n\r\n6. Open both metal clips and pass hydrogen through the vessel until the\r\natmospheric air is replaced by hydrogen. This is determined by\r\ncollecting some of the gas which bubbles through the water in the basin\r\nin a test-tube and testing it by means of a lighted taper.\r\n\r\n7. Close the metal clip on the tube through which the gas is entering;\r\nclose the clip on the exit tube.\r\n\r\n8. Disconnect the gas apparatus.\r\n\r\n9. Incubate.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Method X~ (Botkin's Method).--\r\n\r\n~Apparatus Required.~--\r\n\r\n    Large glass dish 20 cm. diameter and 8 cm. deep. Flat leaden\r\n    cross slightly shorter than the internal diameter of the glass dish.\r\n    Bell glass about 15 cm. diameter and 20 to 25 cm. high.\r\n    Metal frame for plate cultivations.\r\n    _Or_, glass battery jar for tube cultivations.\r\n    Cylinder of compressed hydrogen.\r\n    Rubber tubing.\r\n    Two pieces of ~U~-shaped glass tubing (each arm 8 cm. in length).\r\n    Half a litre of glycerine (or metallic mercury).\r\n\r\nMETHOD.--\r\n\r\n1. Place the leaden cross inside the glass dish, resting on the bottom.\r\n\r\n2. Prepare the cultivations in the usual way.\r\n\r\n3. Place the tube cultivations in a glass battery jar (or the plate\r\ncultivations on a metal frame), resting on the centre of the leaden\r\ncross.\r\n\r\n4. Cover the cultivations with the bell jar.\r\n\r\n5. Adjust the U-shaped pieces of glass tubing in a vertical position on\r\nopposite sides of the bell jar, one arm of each inside the jar, the\r\nother outside. These tubes are best held in position by embedding the\r\nU-shaped bends in two lumps of plasterine stuck on the bottom of the\r\nglass dish. Fix a short length of rubber tubing clamped with a metal\r\nclip to each of the outside arms (Fig. 134).\r\n\r\n6. Fill the glass dish with glycerine or metallic mercury to a depth of\r\nabout 5 cm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 134.--Botkin's apparatus.]\r\n\r\n7. Connect up one U-shaped tube with the hydrogen cylinder (or gas\r\napparatus) by means of rubber tubing. Replace the atmospheric air by\r\nhydrogen, as in method IX.\r\n\r\n8. Clamp the tubes and disconnect the gas apparatus.\r\n\r\n9. Incubate.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Method XI~ (Novy's Method).--\r\n\r\n~Apparatus Required.~--\r\n\r\n    Jar for plate cultivations (Fig. 135).\r\n    _Or_, jar for tube cultivations (Fig. 136).\r\n    Lubricant for stopper of jar.\r\n    Rubber tubing.\r\n    Cylinder of compressed hydrogen.\r\n\r\nMETHOD.--\r\n\r\n1. Prepare cultivations in the usual way.\r\n\r\n2. Place these inside the jar.\r\n\r\n3. Lubricate the stopper and insert it in the mouth of the jar, with the\r\nhandle in a line with the two side tubes.\r\n\r\n4. Connect up the delivery tube a with the hydrogen gas supply by\r\nmeans of rubber tubing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 135.--Novy's jar for plate cultivations.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 136.--Novy's jar for tube cultivations.]\r\n\r\n5. Attach a piece of rubber tubing to the exit tube b and collect\r\nsamples of the issuing gas (over water) and test from time to time.\r\n\r\n6. When the air is completely displaced by hydrogen, turn the handle of\r\nthe stopper at right angles to the line of entry and exit tubes; this\r\nseals the orifice of both tubes.\r\n\r\n7. Disconnect the gas apparatus and incubate.\r\n\r\n\r\n(E) ~Method XII~ (Bulloch's Method).--\r\n\r\n~Apparatus Required.~--\r\n\r\n    Bulloch's jar.\r\n    Pot of resin ointment.\r\n    Small glass dish 14 cm. diameter by 5 cm. deep.\r\n    Vessel for tube cultures or metal rack for plate cultures.\r\n    Pyrogallic acid tablets.\r\n    Cylinder of compressed hydrogen.\r\n    Geryk or other air pump.\r\n    Rubber pressure tubing.\r\n    10 c.c. pipette.\r\n    Glass tubing.\r\n    Dry granulated caustic soda or compressed tablets each, containing\r\n      0.4 grammes sodic hydroxide.\r\n    Small beaker of water.\r\n\r\nMETHOD.--\r\n\r\n1. Prepare the cultivations in the usual way.\r\n\r\n2. Place the glass dish in the centre of the glass slab, and stand the\r\ncultivations inside this.\r\n\r\n3. Place a sufficient number of pyrogallic acid tablets at one side of\r\nthe glass dish (i. e., 1 tablet for each 100 cubic centimeters air\r\ncapacity of the bell jar). Place a small heap of dry granulated soda (or\r\nhalf a dozen tablets of sodic hydroxide) by the side of the pyro\r\ntablets.\r\n\r\n4. Smear the flange of the bell jar with resin ointment and apply the\r\njar firmly to the glass slab, covering the cultivations--so arranged\r\nthat the long tube passes with its lower end into the glass dish at a\r\npoint directly opposite to the pyrogallic acid tablets. Lubricate the\r\ntwo stop-cocks with resin ointment (Fig. 137).\r\n\r\n5. Connect up the short tube a with the gas-supply by means of rubber\r\npressure tubing and open both stop-cocks.\r\n\r\n6. Connect a long, straight piece of glass tubing to the long tube b\r\nby means of a piece of rubber tubing interposing a screw clamp: and\r\ncollect samples of the issuing gas from time to time and test.\r\n\r\n7. When the air is displaced, shut off the stop-cock of the entry tube,\r\nthen that of the exit tube b. Screw down the clamp and remove the\r\nglass tube from the rubber connection and connect up the short tube a\r\nto the air pump by means of pressure tubing.\r\n\r\n8. Open the stop-cock of tube a and with two or three strokes of the\r\nair pump, aspirate a small quantity of gas, so creating a slight vacuum.\r\nThen shut off the stop-cock and disconnect the air pump.\r\n\r\n9. Fill the 10 c.c. bulb pipette with water; insert its point into the\r\nrubber tubing on the long tube b as far as the screw clamp. Open the\r\nscrew clamp and run in water until stopped by the internal pressure.\r\nShut off stop-cock. (The water dissolves the soda and pyrogallic acid\r\nconverting the latter into alkaline pyro. and so bringing its latent\r\ncapacity for oxygen into action).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 137.--Bulloch's jar.]\r\n\r\n10. Reverse the tubes from the tubulures so that they meet, out of\r\nharm's way, over the top of the bell glass; again see that all joints\r\nare tight and transfer the apparatus to the incubator.\r\n\r\nThis last method is the most satisfactory for anaerobic cultivations, as\r\nby its means complete anaerobiosis can be obtained with the least\r\nexpenditure of time and trouble.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[8] See also method of opening and closing culture tubes, pages 74-76.\r\n\r\n[9] If compressed tablets of pyrogallic acid cannot be obtained make up\r\na stock \"acid pyro\" solution\r\n\r\n     Pyrogallic acid,          10 grammes\r\n     Hydrochloric acid,       1.5 c.c.\r\n     Distilled water,         100 c.c.\r\n\r\nand at step 4, run in 10 c.c. of the solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV. METHODS OF ISOLATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe work in the preceding sections, arranged to demonstrate the chief\r\nbiological characters of bacteria in general, is intended to be carried\r\nout by means of cultivations of various organisms previously isolated\r\nand identified and supplied to the student in a state of purity. A\r\ncultivation which comprises the progeny of a single cell is termed a\r\n\"pure culture\"; one which contains representatives of two or more\r\nspecies of bacteria is spoken of as an \"impure,\" or \"mixed\"\r\n\"cultivation,\" and it now becomes necessary to indicate the chief\r\nmethods by which one or more organisms may be isolated in a state of\r\npurity from a mixture; whether that mixture exists as an impure\r\nlaboratory cultivation, or is contained in pus and other morbid\r\nexudations, infected tissues, or water or food-stuffs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 138.--Haematocytometer cell, showing, a, section\r\nthrough the centre of the cell, and b, a magnified image of the cell\r\nrulings.]\r\n\r\nBefore the introduction of solid media the only method of obtaining pure\r\ncultivations was by \"dilution\"--by no means a reliable method.\r\n\"Dilution\" consisted in estimating approximately the number of bacteria\r\npresent in a given volume of fluid (by means of a graduated-celled slide\r\nresembling a haematocytometer, Fig. 138), and diluting the fluid by the\r\naddition of sterile water or bouillon until a given volume (usually 1\r\nc.c.) of the dilution contained but one organism. By planting this\r\nvolume of the fluid into several tubes or flasks of nutrient media, it\r\noccasionally happened that the resulting growth was the product of one\r\nindividual microbe. A method so uncertain is now fortunately replaced by\r\nmany others, more reliable and convenient, and in those methods selected\r\nfor description here, the segregation and isolation of the required\r\nbacteria may be effected--\r\n\r\nA. ~By Mechanical Separation.~\r\n\r\n1. By surface plate cultivation:\r\n\r\n    (a) Gelatine.\r\n    (b) Agar.\r\n    (c) Serum agar.\r\n    (d) Blood agar.\r\n    (e) Hanging-drop or block.\r\n\r\n[2. By Esmarch's roll cultivation:\r\n\r\nThis archaic method (see page 226) is no longer employed for the\r\nisolation of bacteria.]\r\n\r\n3. By serial cultivation.\r\n\r\nB. ~By Biological Differentiation.~\r\n\r\n4. By differential media.\r\n\r\n    (a) Selective.\r\n    (b) Deterrent.\r\n\r\n5. By differential incubation.\r\n\r\n6. By differential sterilisation.\r\n\r\n7. By differential atmosphere cultivation.\r\n\r\n8. By animal inoculation.\r\n\r\nThe selection of the method to be employed in any specific instance will\r\ndepend upon a variety of circumstances, and often a combination of two\r\nor more will ensure a quicker and more reliable result than a rigid\r\nadherence to any one method. Experience is the only reliable guide, but\r\nas a general rule the use of either the first or the third method will\r\nbe found most convenient, affording as each of them does an opportunity\r\nfor the simultaneous isolation of several or all of the varieties of\r\nbacteria present in a mixture.\r\n\r\n~1. Surface Plate Cultivations.~--\r\n\r\n(a) _Gelatine_ (_vide_ page 164).\r\n\r\n(b) _Agar_ (_vide_ page 167).\r\n\r\n(c) _Alkaline serum agar_ (_vide_ page 211).\r\n\r\nThese plates are prepared in a manner precisely similar to that adopted\r\nfor nutrient gelatine and agar surface plates (_vide_ pages 231-233).\r\n\r\n(d) _Serum Agar._--\r\n\r\n1. Melt three tubes of nutrient agar, label them 1, 2, and 3, and place\r\nthem, with three tubes of sterile fluid serum, also labelled 1a, 2a,\r\nand 3a, in a water-bath regulated at 45 deg. C.; allow sufficient time to\r\nelapse for the temperature of the contents of each tube to reach that of\r\nthe water-bath.\r\n\r\n2. Take serum tube No. 1a and agar tube No. 1. Flame the plugs and\r\nremove them from the tubes (retaining the plug of the agar tube in the\r\nhand); flame the mouths of the tubes, pour the serum into the tube of\r\nliquefied agar and replace the plug of the agar tube.\r\n\r\n3. Mix thoroughly and pour plate No. 1 _secundum artem_.\r\n\r\n4. Treat the remaining tube of agar and serum in a similar fashion, and\r\npour plates Nos. 2 and 3.\r\n\r\n5. Dry the serum agar plates in the incubator running at 60 deg. C. for\r\none hour (see page 232).\r\n\r\n6. Inoculate the plates in series as described for gelatine surface\r\nplates (page 231).\r\n\r\n(e) _Blood Agar, Human._--\r\n\r\n1. Melt a tube of sterile agar and pour it into a sterile plate; let it\r\nset.\r\n\r\n2. Collect a few drops of human blood, under all aseptic conditions, in\r\na sterile capillary teat pipette.\r\n\r\n3. Raise the cover of the Petri dish very slightly, insert the extremity\r\nof the capillary pipette, and deposit the blood on the centre of the\r\nagar surface. Close the dish.\r\n\r\n4. Charge a platinum loop with a small quantity of the inoculum. Raise\r\nthe cover of the plate, introduce the loop, mix its contents with the\r\ndrop of blood, remove the loop, close the dish and sterilise the loop.\r\n\r\n5. Finally smear the mixture over the surface of the agar with a\r\nsterilised L-shaped rod.\r\n\r\n6. Label and incubate.\r\n\r\n(If considered necessary, two, three, or more similar plates may be\r\ninoculated in series.)\r\n\r\n(f) _Blood Agar, Animal._--\r\n\r\nWhen preparing citrated blood agar (page 171) it is always advisable to\r\npour several blood agar tubes into plates, which can be stored in the\r\nice chest ready for use at any moment for surface plate cultures.\r\n\r\n(g) Hanging-drop or block culture, (_vide_ page 233).\r\n\r\n~3. Serial Cultivations.~--These are usually made upon agar or\r\nblood-serum, although gelatine may also be used.\r\n\r\nThe method is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Take at least four \"slanted\" tubes of media and number them\r\nconsecutively.\r\n\r\n2. Flame all the plugs and see that each can be readily removed.\r\n\r\n3. Charge the platinum loop with a small quantity of the inoculum,\r\nobserving the usual routine, and plant tube No. 1, smearing thoroughly\r\nall over the surface. If any water of condensation has collected at the\r\nbottom of the tube, use this as a diluent before smearing the contents\r\nof the loop over the surface of the medium.\r\n\r\n4. Without sterilising or recharging the loop, inoculate tube No. 2, by\r\nmaking three parallel streaks from end to end of the slanted surface.\r\n\r\n5. Plant the remainder of the tubes in the series as \"smears\" like tube\r\nNo. 1.\r\n\r\n6. Label with distinctive name or number, and date; incubate.\r\n\r\nThe growth that ensues in the first two or three tubes of the series\r\nwill probably be so crowded as to be useless. Toward the end of the\r\nseries, however, discrete colonies will be found, each of which can be\r\ntransferred to a fresh tube of nutrient medium without risk of\r\ncontamination from the neighbouring colonies.\r\n\r\n\r\n~\"Working\" up Plates.~--\r\n\r\nHaving succeeded in obtaining a plate (or tube cultivation) in which the\r\ncolonies are well grown and sufficiently separated from each other, the\r\nprocess of \"working up,\" \"pricking out,\" or \"fishing\" the colonies in\r\norder to obtain subcultures in a state of purity from each of the\r\ndifferent bacteria present must now be proceeded with.\r\n\r\nOccasionally it happens that this is quite a simple matter. For example,\r\nthe original mixed cultivation when examined microscopically was found\r\nto contain a Gram positive micrococcus, a Gram positive straight\r\nbacillus and a Gram negative short bacillus. The third gelatine plate\r\nprepared from this mixture, on inspection after four day's incubation,\r\nshowed twenty-five colonies--seven moist yellow colonies, each sinking\r\ninto a shallow pit of liquefied gelatine, fourteen flat irridescent\r\nfilmy colonies, and four raised white slimy colonies. A film preparation\r\n(stained Gram) from each variety examined microscopically showed that\r\nthe yellow liquefying colony was composed of Gram positive micrococci;\r\nthe flat colony of Gram positive bacilli and the white colony of gram\r\nnegative bacilli. One of each of these varieties of colonies would be\r\ntransferred by means of the sterilised loop to a fresh gelatine culture\r\ntube, and after incubation the growth in each subculture would\r\ncorrespond culturally and microscopically with that of the plate colony\r\nfrom which it was derived,--the object aimed at would therefore be\r\nachieved.\r\n\r\nUsually, however, the colonies cannot be thus readily differentiated,\r\nand unless they are \"worked up\" in an orderly and systematic manner much\r\nlabour will be vainly expended and valuable time wasted. The following\r\nmethod minimises the difficulties involved.\r\n\r\n\r\n(A) Inspection.\r\n\r\na. Without opening the plate carefully study the various colonies with\r\nthe naked eye, with the assistance of a watchmaker's lens or by\r\ninverting the plate on the stage of the microscope and viewing with the\r\n1-inch objective through the bottom of the plate and the layer of\r\nmedium.\r\n\r\nb. If gross differences can be detected mark a small circle on the\r\nbottom of the plate around the site of each of the selected colonies,\r\nwith the grease pencil.\r\n\r\nc. If no obvious differences can be made out choose nine colonies\r\nhaphazard and indicate their positions by pencil marks on the bottom of\r\nthe plate.\r\n\r\n\r\n(B) Fishing Colonies.--\r\n\r\na. Take a sterile Petri dish and invert it upon the laboratory bench.\r\nRule two parallel lines on the bottom of the dish with a grease pencil,\r\nand two more parallel lines at right angles to the first pair--so\r\ndividing the area of the dish into nine portions. Number the top\r\nright-hand portion 1, and the central bottom portion 8 (Fig. 139).\r\nRevert the dish. The numbers 1 and 8 can be readily recognised through\r\nthe glass and by their positions enable any of the other divisions to be\r\nlocalised by number. This is the stock dish.\r\n\r\nb. Slightly raise the cover of the dish, and with a sterile\r\nteat-pipette deposit a small drop of sterile water in the centre of each\r\nof the nine divisions.\r\n\r\nc. With the sterilised platinum spatula raise one of the marked\r\ncolonies from the \"plate 3\" and transfer it to the first division in the\r\nruled plate and emulsify it in the drop of water awaiting it. Repeat\r\nthis process with the remaining colonies, emulsifying a separate colony\r\nin each drop of water.\r\n\r\n\r\n(C) Preliminary Differentiation of Bacteria.--\r\n\r\na. Prepare a cover-slip film preparation from each drop of emulsion in\r\nthe \"stock dish\" and number to correspond to the division from which it\r\nwas taken. Stain by Gram's method.\r\n\r\nb. Examine microscopically, using the oil immersion lens and note the\r\nnumbers of those cover-slips which morphologically and by Gram results\r\nappear to be composed of different species of bacteria.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 139.--Diagram for stock plate.]\r\n\r\n\r\n(D) Preparing Isolation Subcultures.--\r\n\r\na. Inoculate an agar slope and a broth tube from the emulsion in the\r\nstock dish corresponding to each of these specially selected numbers.\r\n\r\nb. Ascertain whether the cover-slips from the nine emulsions in the\r\nstock dish include all the varieties represented in the cover-slip film\r\npreparation made from the original mixture before plating.\r\n\r\nc. If some varieties are missing prepare a second stock dish from\r\nother colonies on plate 3, and repeat the process until each\r\nmorphological form or tinctorial variety has been secured in subculture.\r\n\r\n_d._ Place the stock dishes in the ice chest to await the results of\r\nincubation. (If any of the subcultures fail, further material can be\r\nobtained from the corresponding emulsion; or if it has dried, by\r\nmoistening it with a further drop of sterile distilled water.)\r\n\r\n_e._ Incubate all the subcultures and identify the organisms picked out.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Differential Media.--\r\n\r\n(a) _Selective._--Some varieties of media are specially suitable for\r\ncertain species of bacteria and enable them to overgrow and finally\r\nchoke out other varieties; e. g., wort is the most suitable\r\nmedium-base for the growth of torulae and yeasts and should be employed\r\nwhen pouring plates for the isolation of these organisms. To obtain a\r\npure cultivation of yeast from a mixture containing bacteria as well, it\r\nis often sufficient to inoculate wort from the mixture and incubate at\r\n37 deg. C. for twenty-four hours. Plant a fresh tube of wort from the\r\nresulting growth and incubate. Repeat the process once more, and from\r\nthe growth in this third tube plant a streak on wort gelatine, and\r\nincubate at 20 deg. C. The resulting growth will almost certainly be\r\na pure culture of the yeast.\r\n\r\n(b) _Deterrent._--The converse of the above also obtains. Certain\r\nmedia possess the power of inhibiting the growth of a greater or less\r\nnumber of species. For instance, media containing carbolic acid to the\r\namount of 1 per cent. will inhibit the growth of practically everything\r\nbut the Bacillus coli communis.\r\n\r\n\r\n~5. Differential Incubation.~--\r\n\r\nIn isolating certain bacteria, advantage is taken of the fact that\r\ndifferent species vary in their optimum temperature. A mixture\r\ncontaining the Bacillus typhosus and the Bacillus aquatilis sulcatus,\r\nfor example, may be planted on two slanted agar tubes, the one incubated\r\nat 40 deg. C., and the other at 12 deg. C. After twenty-four hours'\r\nincubation the first will show a pure cultivation of the Bacillus\r\ntyphosus, whilst the second will be an almost pure culture of the\r\nBacillus aquatilis.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Differential Sterilisation.--\r\n\r\n(a) _Non-sporing Bacteria._--Similarly, advantage may be taken of the\r\nvarying thermal death-points of bacteria. From a mixture of two\r\norganisms whose thermal death-points differ by, say, 4 deg. C.--e. g.,\r\nBacillus pyocyaneus, thermal death-point 55 deg. C., and Bacillus\r\nmesentericus vulgatus, thermal death-point 60 deg. C.--a pure cultivation\r\nof the latter may be obtained by heating the mixture in a water-bath to\r\n58 deg. C. and keeping it at that point for ten minutes. The mixture is\r\nthen planted on to fresh media and incubated, when the resulting growth\r\nwill be found to consist entirely of the B. mesentericus.\r\n\r\n(b) _Sporing Bacteria._--This method finds its chief practical\r\napplication in the differentiation of a spore-bearing organism from one\r\nwhich does not form spores. In this case the mixture is heated in a\r\nwater-bath at 80 deg. C. for fifteen to twenty minutes. At the end of this\r\ntime the non-sporing bacteria are dead, and cultivations made from the\r\nmixture will yield a growth resulting from the germination of the spores\r\nonly.\r\n\r\nDifferential sterilisation at 80 deg. C. is most conveniently carried out\r\nin a water-bath of special construction, designed by Balfour Stewart (Fig.\r\n140). It consists of a double-walled copper vessel mounted on legs, and\r\nprovided with a tubulure communicating with the space between the walls.\r\nThis space is nearly filled with benzole (boiling-point 80 deg. C.; pure\r\nbenzole, free from thiophene must be employed for the purpose, otherwise\r\nthe boiling-point gradually and perceptibly rises in the course of\r\ntime), and to the tubulure is fitted a long glass tube, some 2 metres\r\nlong and about 0.75 cm. diameter, serving as a condensing tube (a tube\r\nhalf this length if provided with a condensing bulb at the centre will\r\nbe equally efficient). The interior of the vessel is partly filled with\r\nwater and covered with a lid which is perforated for a thermometer. This\r\nlatter dips into the water and records its temperature. A very small\r\nBunsen flame under the apparatus suffices to keep the benzole boiling\r\nand the water within at a constant temperature of 80 deg. C. The bath is\r\nthus always ready for use.\r\n\r\nMETHOD.--To use the apparatus.\r\n\r\n1. Place some of the mixture itself, if fluid, containing the spores, or\r\nan emulsion of the same if derived from solid material, in a test-tube.\r\n\r\n2. Immerse the test-tube in the water contained in the benzole bath,\r\ntaking care that the upper level of the liquid in the tube is at least 2\r\ncm. beneath the surface of the water in the copper vessel.\r\n\r\n3. The temperature of the water, of course, falls a few degrees after\r\nopening the bath and introducing a tube of colder liquid, but after a\r\nfew minutes the temperature will have again reached 80 deg. C.\r\n\r\n4. When the thermometer again records 80 deg. C., note the time, and\r\nfifteen minutes later remove the tube containing the mixture from the\r\nbath.\r\n\r\n5. Make cultures upon suitable media; incubate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 140.--Benzole bath.]\r\n\r\n\r\n7. Differential Atmosphere Cultivation.--\r\n\r\n(a) By adapting the atmospheric conditions to the particular organism\r\nit is desired to isolate, it is comparatively easy to separate a strict\r\naerobe from a strict anaerobe, and _vice versa_. In the first case,\r\nhowever, it is important that the cultivations should be made upon\r\nsolid media, for if carried out in fluid media the aerobes multiplying\r\nin the upper layers of fluid render the depths completely anaerobic, and\r\nunder these conditions the growth of the anaerobes will continue\r\nunchecked.\r\n\r\n(b) When it is desired to separate a facultative anaerobe from a\r\nstrict anaerobe, it is generally sufficient to plant the mixture upon\r\nthe sloped surface agar, incubate aerobically at 37 deg. C., and examine\r\ncarefully at frequent intervals. At the first sign of growth,\r\nsubcultivations must be prepared and treated in a similar manner. As a\r\nresult of these rapid subcultures, the facultative anaerobe will be\r\nsecured in pure culture at about the third or fourth generation.\r\n\r\n(c) If, on the other hand, the strict anaerobe is the organism\r\nrequired from a mixture of facultative and strict anaerobes, pour plates\r\nof glucose formate agar (or gelatine) in the usual manner, place them in\r\na Bulloch's or Novy's jar, and incubate at a suitable temperature. Pick\r\noff the colonies of the required organism when the growth appears, and\r\ntransfer to tubes of the various media.\r\n\r\nIncubate under suitable conditions as to temperature and atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n~8. Animal Inoculation.~--\r\n\r\nFinally, when dealing with pathogenic organisms, it is often advisable\r\nto inoculate some of the impure culture (or even some of the original\r\n_materies morbi_) into an animal specially chosen on account of its\r\nsusceptibility to the particular pathogenic organism it is desired to\r\ninoculate. Indeed, with some of the more sensitive and strictly\r\nparasitic bacteria this method of animal inoculation is practically the\r\nonly method that will yield a satisfactory result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI. METHODS OF IDENTIFICATION AND STUDY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to identify an organism after isolation, tube, plate, and other\r\ncultivations must be prepared, incubated under suitable conditions as to\r\ntemperature and environment, and examined from time to time (a)\r\n~macroscopically~, (b) by ~microscopical methods~, (c) by ~chemical\r\nmethods~, (d) by ~physical methods~, (e) by ~inoculation methods~, and\r\nthe results of these examinations duly recorded.\r\n\r\nIt must be stated definitely that no micro-organism can be identified by\r\nany _one_ character or property, whether microscopical, biological or\r\nchemical, but that on the contrary its entire life history must be\r\ncarefully studied and then its identity established from a consideration\r\nof the sum total of these observations.\r\n\r\nIn order to give to the recorded results their maximum value it is\r\nessential that they should be exact and systematic, therefore some such\r\nscheme as the following should be adhered to; and especially is this\r\nnecessary in describing an organism not previously isolated and studied.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHEME OF STUDY.\r\n\r\nDesignation:\r\n\r\nOriginally isolated by (_observer's name_) in (_date_), from (_source of\r\norganism_).\r\n\r\n     ~1.

If liquefaction is present, note shape and character\r\n(_vide_ page 269, \"stab\" cultures).\r\n\r\n_Agar._--No liquefaction takes place in this medium. The liquid found on\r\nthe surface of the agar (or at the bottom of the tube in agar tube\r\ncultures) is merely water which has been expressed during the rapid\r\nsolidification of the medium and has subsequently condensed.\r\n\r\n_Gelatine and Agar._--Examine the colonies at intervals of twenty-four\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n(a) With the naked eye.\r\n\r\n(b) With a hand lens or watchmaker's glass.\r\n\r\n(c) Under a low power (1 inch) of the microscope, or by means of a small\r\ndissecting microscope.\r\n\r\nDistinguish superficial from deep colonies and note the characters of\r\nthe individual colonies.\r\n\r\n(A) ~Size.~--The diameter in millimetres, at the various ages.\r\n\r\n(B) ~Shape.~--\r\n\r\nPunctiform: Dimensions too slight for defining form by naked eye;\r\nminute, raised, hemispherical.\r\n\r\nRound: Of a more or less circular outline.\r\n\r\nElliptical: Of a more or less oval outline.\r\n\r\nIrregular: Outlines not conforming to any recognised shape.\r\n\r\nFusiform: Spindle-shaped, tapering at each end.\r\n\r\nCochleate: Spiral or twisted like a snail shell (Fig. 141, a).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 141.--Types of colonies: a, Cochleate;

C.\r\n\r\n                                             ~Precipitate~ of mercurous\r\n                                             chloride which is slowly\r\n                                             reduced to mercury =\r\n                                             _formic_ acid.\r\n\r\n8. If the distillation of \"B\" is continued as long as acid comes over\r\n(distilled water being occasionally added to the distilling flask) the\r\ndistillate can be measured and 50 c.c. used for titration. This will\r\ngive the amount of volatile acid formation.\r\n\r\n9. The second part of the filtrate \"B\" (see page 282) should be examined\r\nfor lactic, oxalic, succinic, benzoic, salicylic, gallic and tannic\r\nacids, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n~Ether Soluble Acids.~--\r\n\r\n1. Evaporate to a thin syrup, acidify strongly with phosphoric acid.\r\n\r\n2. Extract with five times its volume of ether by agitation in a\r\nseparatory funnel.\r\n\r\n3. Evaporate the ethereal extract to a thin syrup.\r\n\r\n4. Add 100 c.c. water and mix thoroughly.\r\n\r\n5. To a small portion of this solution add slight excess of sodium\r\ncarbonate, evaporate to dryness on the water-bath, dissolve in 5-10 c.c.\r\npure sulphuric acid, add 2 drops saturated copper sulphate solution,\r\nplace in a test-tube and heat in a boiling water-bath for 2 minutes,\r\ncool, add 2 or 3 drops of the alcoholic thiophene and warm gently.\r\n\r\nCherry red colour = lactic acid.\r\n\r\nIf a brown colour is produced on the addition of sulphuric acid, another\r\nsample should be taken and boiled with animal charcoal before\r\nevaporating.\r\n\r\n6. If lactic acid is definitely present, prepare zinc lactate by boiling\r\npart of the solution of the ether extract with excess of zinc carbonate,\r\nfiltering and evaporating to crystallise. The crystals so obtained have\r\na characteristic form, and if dried at 110 deg. C, should contain 26.87\r\nper cent. of zinc.\r\n\r\n7. Test a portion of the rest of the solution of the ether extract for\r\noxalic acid (page 282, step 5). Carefully neutralise the remainder and\r\nadd ferric chloride solution.\r\n\r\nRed brown gelatinous precipitate = succinic acid.\r\n\r\nBuff precipitate = benzoic acid, and other acids related to benzoic\r\nacid.\r\n\r\nViolet colour = salicylic acid.\r\n\r\nInky black colour or precipitate = gallic acid or tannic acid.\r\n\r\nFor further identification the melting-points of the crystalline acids,\r\nand the percentage of silver in their silver salts should be determined.\r\n\r\n\r\n~3. Ammonia Production.~--\r\n\r\n    _Medium Required_:\r\n    Nutrient bouillon.\r\n\r\n    _Reagent Required_:\r\n    Nessler reagent.\r\n\r\nMETHOD.--\r\n\r\n1. Prepare cultivation in bulk (100 c.c.) in a 250 c.c. flask and\r\nincubate together with a control flask.\r\n\r\nTest the cultivation and the control for ammonia in the following\r\nmanner:\r\n\r\n2. To each flask add 2 grammes of calcined magnesia, then connect up\r\nwith condensers and distil.\r\n\r\n3. Collect 50 c.c. distillate, from each, in a Nessler glass.\r\n\r\n4. Add 1 c.c. Nessler reagent to each glass by means of a clean pipette.\r\n\r\nYellow colour = ammonia.\r\n\r\nThe depth of colour is proportionate to the amount present.\r\n\r\n\r\n~4. Alcohol, etc., Production.~--Divide the distillate \"A\" obtained in the\r\ncourse of a previous experiment (_vide_ page 282, step 3) into four\r\nportions and test for the production of alcohol, acetaldehyde, acetone.\r\n\r\n1. Add Lugol's iodine, then a little NaOH solution, and stir with a\r\nglass rod till the colour of the iodine disappears.\r\n\r\nPale-yellow crystalline precipitate of iodoform, with its characteristic\r\nsmell, appearing in the cold, indicates acetaldehyde, or acetone;\r\nappearing only on warming indicates alcohol.\r\n\r\nThe precipitate may be absent even when the odour is pronounced.\r\n\r\n2. Add Schiff's reagent.\r\n\r\nViolet or red colour = aldehyde.\r\n\r\n3. To 10 c.c. of solution add 2.5 c.c., 25 per cent. sulphuric acid, and\r\na crystal or two of potassium bichromate and distil. Reduction of the\r\nbichromate to a green colour and a distillate, which smells of\r\nacetaldehyde and reacts with Schiff's reagent, shows the presence of\r\nalcohol in the original liquid.\r\n\r\n4. Add a few drops of sodium nitroprusside solution, make alkaline with\r\nammonia, then saturate with ammonium sulphate crystals. Acetone gives\r\nlittle colour on the addition of ammonia, but after the addition of\r\nammonium sulphate a deep permanganate colour, which takes ten minutes to\r\nreach its full intensity. Aldehyde gives a carmine red unaltered by\r\nammonium sulphate.\r\n\r\n\r\n~5. Indol Production.~--\r\n\r\n    _Media Required_:\r\n\r\n    Inosite-free bouillon (_vide_ page 183).\r\n    Or peptone water (_vide_ page 177).\r\n\r\n    _Reagents Required_:\r\n\r\n    Potassium persulphate, saturated aqueous solution.\r\n    Paradimethylamino-benzaldehyde solution. This is prepared by mixing:\r\n\r\n      Paradimethylamino-benzaldehyde      4 grammes\r\n      Absolute alcohol                  380 c.c.\r\n      Hydrochloric acid, concentrated    80 c.c.\r\n\r\nMETHOD.--\r\n\r\nPrepare several test-tube cultivations of the organism to be tested, and\r\nincubate.\r\n\r\nTest for indol by means of the Rosindol reaction in the following\r\nmanner. (If the culture has been incubated at 37 deg. C., it must be\r\nallowed to cool to the room temperature before applying the test.)\r\n\r\n1. Remove 2 c.c. of the cultivation by means of a sterile pipette and\r\ntransfer to a clean tube, then,\r\n\r\n2. Add 2 c.c. paradimethylamino-benzaldehyde solution.\r\n\r\n3. Add 2 c.c. potassium persulphate solution.\r\n\r\nThe presence of indol is indicated by the appearance of a delicate\r\nrose-pink colour throughout the mixture which deepens slightly on\r\nstanding.\r\n\r\n     Indol is tested for in many laboratories by the ordinary\r\n     nitrosoindol reaction which, however, is not so delicate a\r\n     method as that above described. The test is carried out as\r\n     follows:\r\n\r\n     1. Remove the cotton-wool plug from the tube, and run in 1\r\n     c.c. pure concentrated sulphuric acid down the side of the\r\n     tube by means of a sterile pipette. Place the tube upright\r\n     in a rack, and allow it to stand, if necessary, for ten\r\n     minutes.\r\n\r\n     A rose-pink or red colour at the junction of the two liquids\r\n     = indol (_plus a nitrite_).\r\n\r\n     2. If the colour of the medium remains unaltered, add 2 c.c.\r\n     of a 0.01 per cent. aqueous solution sodium nitrite, and\r\n     again allow the culture to stand for ten minutes.\r\n\r\n     Red colouration = indol.\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--In place of performing the test in two stages as\r\n     given above, 2 c.c. concentrated _commercial_ sulphuric,\r\n     hydrochloric, or nitric acid (all of which hold a trace of\r\n     nitrite in solution), may be run into the cultivation. The\r\n     development of a red colour within twenty minutes will\r\n     indicate the presence of indol.\r\n\r\n\r\n~5a. Phenol Production.~--\r\n\r\n    _Medium Required_:\r\n\r\n    Nutrient bouillon.\r\n\r\n    _Reagents Required_:\r\n\r\n    Hydrochloric acid, concentrated.\r\n    Millon's reagent.\r\n    Ferric chloride, 1 per cent. aqueous solution.\r\n\r\nMETHOD.--\r\n\r\n1. Prepare cultivation in a Bohemian flask containing at least 50 c.c.\r\nof medium, and incubate.\r\n\r\nTest for phenol in the following manner:\r\n\r\n2. Add 5 c.c., 25 per cent. sulphuric acid to the cultivation and\r\nconnect up the flask with a condenser.\r\n\r\n3. Distil over 15 to 20 c.c. Divide the distillate into three portions\r\na, b and c.\r\n\r\n4. Add to (a) 0.5 c.c. Millon's reagent and boil.\r\n\r\nRed colour = phenol.\r\n\r\n5. Add to (b) about 0.5 c.c. ferric chloride solution. Violet colour =\r\nphenol.\r\n\r\n(If the distillate be acid the reaction will be negative.)\r\n\r\n6. Add to (c) bromine water. Crystalline white ppt. of tribromo-phenol\r\n= phenol.\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--If both indol and phenol appear to be present in\r\n     cultivations of the same organism, it is well to separate\r\n     them before testing. This may be done in the following\r\n     manner:\r\n\r\n1. Prepare inosite-free bouillon cultivation, say 200 or 300 c.c., in a\r\nflask as before.\r\n\r\n2. Render definitely acid by the addition of acetic acid and connect up\r\nthe flask with a condenser.\r\n\r\n3. Distil over 50 to 70 c.c.\r\n\r\nDistillate will contain both indol and phenol.\r\n\r\n4. Render the distillate strongly alkaline with caustic potash and\r\nredistil.\r\n\r\nDistillate will contain indol; residue will contain phenol.\r\n\r\n5. Test the distillate for indol (_vide ante_).\r\n\r\n6. Saturate the residue, when cold, with carbon dioxide and redistil.\r\n\r\n7. Test this distillate for phenol (_vide ante_).\r\n\r\n\r\n~6. Pigment Production.~--\r\n\r\n1. Prepare tube cultivations upon the various media and incubate under\r\nvarying conditions as to temperature (at 37 deg. C. and at 20 deg. C.),\r\natmosphere (aerobic and anaerobic), and light (exposure to and\r\nprotection from).\r\n\r\nNote the conditions most favorable to pigment formation.\r\n\r\n2. Note the solubility of the pigment in various solvents, such as water\r\n(hot and cold), alcohol, ether, chloroform, benzol, carbon bisulphide.\r\n\r\n3. Note the effect of acids and alkalies respectively upon the pigmented\r\ncultivation, or upon solutions of the pigment.\r\n\r\n4. Note spectroscopic reactions.\r\n\r\n\r\n~7. Reducing Agent Formation.~--\r\n\r\n(a) _Colour Destruction._--\r\n\r\n1. Prepare tube cultivations in nutrient bouillon tinted with litmus,\r\nrosolic acid, neutral red, and incubate.\r\n\r\n2. Examine the cultures each day and note whether any colour change\r\noccurs.\r\n\r\n(b) _Nitrates to Nitrites._--\r\n\r\n    _Medium Required_:\r\n\r\n    Nitrate bouillon (_vide_ page 185).\r\n    Or nitrate peptone solution (_vide_ page 186).\r\n\r\n    _Reagents Required_:\r\n\r\n    Sulphuric acid (25 per cent.).\r\n    Metaphenylene diamine, 5 per cent. aqueous solution.\r\n\r\nMETHOD.--\r\n\r\n1. Prepare tube cultivations and incubate together with control tubes\r\n(i. e., uninoculated tubes of the same medium, placed under identical\r\nconditions as to environment).\r\n\r\nThis precaution is necessary as the medium is liable to take up nitrites\r\nfrom the atmosphere, and an opinion as to the absence of nitrites in the\r\ncultivation is often based upon an equal colouration of the medium in\r\nthe control tube.\r\n\r\nTest both the culture tube and the control tube for the presence of\r\nnitrites.\r\n\r\n2. Add a few drops of sulphuric acid to the medium in each of the tubes.\r\n\r\n3. Then run in 2 or 3 c.c. metaphenylene diamine into each tube.\r\nBrownish-red colour = nitrites.\r\n\r\nThe depth of colour is proportionate to the amount present.\r\n\r\n\r\n~8. Gas Production.~--\r\n\r\n(A) _Carbon Dioxide and Hydrogen._--\r\n\r\n     _Apparatus Required_:\r\n\r\n     Fermentation tubes (_vide_ page 161) containing sugar\r\n     bouillon (glucose, lactose, etc.). The medium should be\r\n     prepared from inosite-free bouillon (_vide_ page 183).\r\n\r\n     _Reagent Required_:\r\n\r\n     n/2 caustic soda.\r\n\r\nMETHOD.--\r\n\r\n1. Inoculate the surface of the medium in the bulb of a fermentation\r\ntube and incubate.\r\n\r\n2. Mark the level of the fluid in the closed branch of the fermentation\r\ntube, at intervals of twenty-four hours, and when the evolution of gas\r\nhas ceased, measure the length of the column of gas with the millimetre\r\nscale.\r\n\r\nExpress this column of gas as a percentage of the entire length of the\r\nclosed branch.\r\n\r\n3. To analyse the gas and to determine roughly the relative proportions\r\nof CO_{2} and H_{2}, proceed as follows:\r\n\r\nFill the bulb of the fermentation tube with caustic soda solution.\r\n\r\nClose the mouth of the bulb with a rubber stopper.\r\n\r\nAlternately invert and revert the tube six or eight times, to bring the\r\nsoda solution into intimate contact with the gas.\r\n\r\nReturn the residual gas to the end of the closed branch, and measure.\r\n\r\nThe loss in volume of gas = carbon dioxide.\r\n\r\nThe residual gas = hydrogen.\r\n\r\nTransfer gas to the bulb of the tube, and explode it by applying a\r\nlighted taper.\r\n\r\n(B) _Sulphuretted Hydrogen._--\r\n\r\n    _Media Required_:\r\n\r\n    Iron peptone solution (_vide_ page 185).\r\n    Lead peptone solution.\r\n\r\n1. Inoculate tubes of media, and incubate together with control tubes.\r\n\r\n2. Examine from day to day, at intervals of twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nThe liberation of the H_{2}S will cause the yellowish-white precipitate\r\nto darken to a brownish-black, or jet black, the depth of the colour\r\nbeing proportionate to the amount of sulphuretted hydrogen present.\r\n\r\nQuantitative: For exact quantitative analyses of the gases produced by\r\nbacteria from certain media of definite composition, the methods devised\r\nby Pakes must be employed, as follows:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 153.--Gas-collecting apparatus.]\r\n\r\n     _Apparatus Required_:\r\n\r\n     Bohemian flask (300 to 1500 c.c. capacity) containing from\r\n     100 to 400 c.c. of the medium. The mouth of the flask is\r\n     fitted with a perforated rubber stopper, carrying an\r\n     L-shaped piece of glass tubing (the short arm passing just\r\n     through the stopper). To the long arm of the tube is\r\n     attached a piece of pressure tubing some 8 cm. in length,\r\n     plugged at its free end with a piece of cotton-wool. Measure\r\n     accurately the total capacity of the flask and exit tube,\r\n     also the amount of medium contained. Note the difference.\r\n\r\n     Gas receiver. This is a bell jar of stout glass, 14 cm. high\r\n     and 9 cm. in diameter. At its apex a glass tube is fused in.\r\n     This rises vertically 5 cm., and is then bent at right\r\n     angles, the horizontal arm being 10 cm. in length. A\r\n     three-way tap is let horizontally into the vertical tube\r\n     just above its junction with the bell jar.\r\n\r\n     An iron cylinder just large enough to contain the bell jar.\r\n\r\n     About 15 kilos of metallic mercury.\r\n\r\n     Melted paraffin.\r\n\r\nAn Orsat-Lunge working with mercury instead of water, provided with two\r\ngas tubes of extra length (capacity 120 and 60 c.c. respectively and\r\ngraduated throughout, both being water-jacketed) or other gas analysis\r\napparatus, capable of dealing with CO_{2}, O_{2}, H_{2}, and N_{2}.\r\n\r\nMETHOD.--\r\n\r\n1. Inoculate the medium in the flask in the usual manner, by means of a\r\nplatinum needle, taking care that the neck of the flask and the rubber\r\nstopper are thoroughly flamed before and after the operation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 154.--Orsat-Lunge gas analysis apparatus.]\r\n\r\n2. Fill the iron cylinder with mercury.\r\n\r\n3. Place the bell jar mouth downward in the mercury--first seeing that\r\nthere is free communication between the interior of the jar and the\r\nexternal air--and suck up the mercury into the tap; then shut off the\r\ntap.\r\n\r\n4. Plug the open end of the three-way tap with melted wax.\r\n\r\n5. Connect up the horizontal arm of the culture flask with that of the\r\ngas receiver by means of the pressure tubing (after removing the\r\ncotton-wool plug from the rubber tube), as shown in Fig. 153.\r\n\r\n6. Give the three-way tap half turn to open communication between flask\r\nand receiver, and seal _all_ joints by coating with a film of melted\r\nwax. When the tap is turned, the mercury in the receiver will naturally\r\nfall.\r\n\r\n7. Place the entire apparatus in the incubator. (Two hours later, by\r\nwhich time the temperature of the apparatus is that of the incubator,\r\nmark the height of the mercury on the receiver.)\r\n\r\n8. Examine the apparatus from day to day and mark the level of the\r\nmercury in the receiver at intervals of twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n9. When the evolution of gas has ceased, remove the apparatus from the\r\nincubator; clear out the wax from the nozzle of the three-way tap (first\r\nadjusting the tap so that no escape of gas shall take place) and connect\r\nit with the Orsat.\r\n\r\n10. Remove, say, 100 c.c. of gas from the receiver, reverse the tap and\r\nforce it into the culture flask. Remove 100 c.c. of mixed gases from the\r\nculture flask and replace in the receiver.\r\n\r\nRepeat these processes three or four times to ensure thorough admixture\r\nof the contents of flask and receiver.\r\n\r\n11. Now withdraw a sample of the mixed gases into the Orsat and analyse.\r\n\r\nIn calculating the results be careful to allow for the volume of air\r\ncontained in the flask at the commencement of the experiment.\r\n\r\nFor the collection of gases formed under anaerobic conditions a slightly\r\ndifferent procedure is adopted:\r\n\r\n1. Fix a culture flask (500 c.c. capacity) with a perforated rubber\r\nstopper carrying an ~L~-shaped piece of manometer tubing, each arm 5 cm.\r\nin length.\r\n\r\n2. Prepare a second ~L~-shaped piece of tubing, the short arm 5 cm. and\r\nthe long arm 20 cm., and connect its short arm to the horizontal arm of\r\nthe tube in the culture flask by means of a length of pressure tubing,\r\nprovided with a screw clamp.\r\n\r\n3. Fill the culture flask completely with boiling medium and pass the\r\nlong piece of tubing through the plug of an Erlenmeyer flask (150 c.c.\r\ncapacity) which contains 100 c.c. of the same medium.\r\n\r\n4. Sterilise these coupled flasks by the discontinuous method, in the\r\nusual manner.\r\n\r\nImmediately the last sterilisation is completed, screw up the clamp on\r\nthe pressure tubing which connects them, and allow them to cool.\r\n\r\nAs the fluid cools and contracts it leaves a vacuum in the neck of the\r\nflask below the rubber stopper.\r\n\r\n5. To inoculate the culture flask, withdraw the long arm of the bent\r\ntube from the Erlenmeyer flask and pass it to the bottom of a test-tube\r\ncontaining a young cultivation (in a fluid medium similar to that\r\ncontained in the culture flask) of the organism it is desired to\r\ninvestigate.\r\n\r\n6. Slightly release the clamp on the pressure tubing to allow 4 or 5\r\nc.c. of the culture to enter the flask.\r\n\r\n7. Clamp the rubber tube tightly; remove the bent glass tube from the\r\nculture tube and plunge it into a flask containing recently boiled and\r\nquickly cooled distilled water.\r\n\r\n8. Release the clamp again and wash in the remains of the cultivation\r\nuntil the culture flask and tubing are completely filled with water.\r\n\r\n9. Clamp the rubber tubing tightly and take away the long-armed glass\r\ntubing.\r\n\r\n10. Prepare the gas receiver as in the previous method (in this case,\r\nhowever, the mercury should be warmed slightly) and fill the horizontal\r\narm of the receiver with hot water.\r\n\r\n11. Connect up the culture flask with the horizontal arm of the gas\r\nreceiver.\r\n\r\n12. Remove the screw clamp from the rubber tubing, adjust the three-way\r\ntap, seal all joints with melted wax, and incubate.\r\n\r\n13. Complete the investigation as described for the previous method.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY PHYSICAL METHODS.\r\n\r\nExamine cultivations of the organism with reference to its growth and\r\ndevelopment under the following headings:\r\n\r\nAtmosphere:\r\n\r\n(a) In the presence of oxygen.\r\n\r\n(b) In the absence of oxygen.\r\n\r\n(c) In the presence of gases other than oxygen.\r\n\r\nTemperature:\r\n\r\n(a) Range.\r\n\r\n(b) Optimum.\r\n\r\n(c) Thermal death-point:\r\n\r\n    Moist: Vegetative forms.\r\n\r\n           Spores.\r\n\r\n    Dry: Vegetative forms.\r\n\r\n           Spores.\r\n\r\nReaction of medium.\r\n\r\nResistance to lethal agents:\r\n\r\n(a) Desiccation.\r\n\r\n    (b) Light: Diffuse.\r\n\r\n               Direct.\r\n\r\n               Primary colours.\r\n\r\n(c) Heat.\r\n\r\n(d) Chemical antiseptics and disinfectants.\r\n\r\nVitality in artificial cultures.\r\n\r\n~I. Atmosphere.~--The question as to whether the organism under\r\nobservation is (a) an obligate aerobe, (b) a facultative anaerobe, or\r\n(c) an obligate anaerobe is roughly decided by the appearance of\r\ncultivations in the fermentation tubes. Obvious growth in the closed\r\nbranch as well as in the bulb or in the inverted gas tube as well as in\r\nthe bulk of the medium will indicate that it is a facultative anaerobe;\r\nwhilst growth only occurring in the bulb or in the closed branch shows\r\nthat it is an obligate aerobe or anaerobe respectively. This method,\r\nhowever, is not sufficiently accurate for the present purpose, and the\r\nexamination of an organism with respect to its behaviour in the absence\r\nof oxygen is carried out as follows:\r\n\r\n     _Apparatus Required:_\r\n\r\n    Buchner's tubes.\r\n    Bulloch's apparatus.\r\n    Exhaust pump.\r\n    Pyrogallic acid.\r\n    Dekanormal caustic soda.\r\n\r\n     _Media Required:_\r\n\r\n    Glucose formate agar.\r\n    Glucose formate gelatine.\r\n    Glucose formate bouillon.\r\n\r\nMETHOD.--\r\n\r\n1. Prepare four sets of cultivations:\r\n\r\n(A) Sloped glucose formate agar, and incubate aerobically at 37 deg. C.\r\n\r\nSloped glucose formate gelatine, and incubate aerobically at 20 deg. C.\r\n\r\n(B) Sloped glucose agar to incubate anaerobically at 37 deg. C.\r\n\r\nSloped glucose formate gelatine to incubate anaerobically at 20 deg. C.\r\n\r\n(C) Sloped glucose formate agar to incubate anaerobically at 37 deg. C.\r\n\r\nGlucose formate bouillon to incubate anaerobically at 37 deg. C.\r\n\r\n(D) Sloped glucose formate gelatine to incubate anaerobically at\r\n20 deg. C.\r\n\r\nGlucose formate bouillon to incubate anaerobically at 20 deg. C.\r\n\r\n2. Seal the cultures forming set B in Buchner's tubes (_vide_ page 239).\r\n\r\n3. Seal the cultures forming set C in Bulloch's apparatus; exhaust the\r\nair by means of a vacuum pump, and provide for the absorption of any\r\nresidual oxygen by the introduction of pyrogallic acid and caustic soda\r\nin solution (_vide_ page 245). Treat set D in the same way.\r\n\r\n4. Observe the cultivations macroscopically and microscopically at\r\nintervals of twenty-four hours until the completion, if necessary, of\r\nseven days' incubation.\r\n\r\n5. Control these results.\r\n\r\n_Gases Other than Oxygen._--\r\n\r\n\r\n_Apparatus Required:_\r\n\r\n    Bulloch's apparatus.\r\n    Sterile gas filter (_vide_ page 40).\r\n    Gasometer containing the gas it is desired to test (SO_{2}, N_{2}O, NO,\r\n      CO_{2}, etc.) or gas generator for its production.\r\n\r\nMETHOD.--\r\n\r\n1. Prepare at least seven tube cultivations upon solid media and deposit\r\nthem in Bulloch's apparatus.\r\n\r\n2. Connect up the inlet tube of the Bulloch's jar with the sterile gas\r\nfilter, and this again with the delivery tube of the gasometer or gas\r\ngenerator.\r\n\r\n3. Open both stop-cocks of the Bulloch's apparatus and pass the gas\r\nthrough until it has completely replaced the air in the bell jar as\r\nshown by the result of analyses of samples collected from the exit tube.\r\n\r\n4. Incubate under optimum conditions as to temperature.\r\n\r\n5. Examine the cultivations at intervals of twenty-four hours, until the\r\ncompletion of seven days.\r\n\r\n6. Remove one tube from the interior of the apparatus each day. If no\r\ngrowth is visible, incubate the tube under optimum conditions as to\r\ntemperature _and_ atmosphere, and in this way determine the length of\r\nexposure to the action of the gas necessary to kill the organisms under\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\n7. Control these results.\r\n\r\n~II. Temperature.~--\r\n\r\n(A) _Range._--\r\n\r\n1. Prepare a series of ten tube cultivations, in fluid media, of optimum\r\nreaction.\r\n\r\n2. Arrange a series of incubators at fixed temperatures, varying 5 deg. C.\r\nand including temperatures between 5 deg. C. and 50 deg. C.\r\n\r\n(In the absence of a sufficient number of incubators utilise the\r\nwater-bath employed in testing the thermal death-point of vegetative\r\nforms.)\r\n\r\n3. Incubate one tube cultivation of the organism aerobically or\r\nanaerobically, as may be necessary, in each incubator, and examine at\r\nhalf-hour intervals for from five to eighteen hours.\r\n\r\n4. Note that temperature at which growth is first observed\r\nmacroscopically (Optimum temperature).\r\n\r\n5. Continue the incubation until the completion of seven days. Note the\r\nextremes of temperature at which growth takes place (Range of\r\ntemperature).\r\n\r\n6. Control these results--if considered necessary arranging the series\r\nof incubators to include each degree centigrade for five degrees beyond\r\neach of the extremes previously noted.\r\n\r\n(B) _Optimum._--\r\n\r\n1. Prepare a second series of ten tube cultivations under similar\r\nconditions as to reaction of medium.\r\n\r\n2. Incubate in a series of incubators in which the temperature is\r\nregulated at intervals of 1 deg. C. for five degrees on either side of\r\noptimum temperature observed in the previous experiment (A, step 4).\r\n\r\n3. Observe again at half-hour intervals and note that temperature at\r\nwhich growth is first visible to the naked eye = Optimum temperature.\r\n\r\n(C) _Thermal Death-point (t. d. p.)_--\r\n\r\nMoist--Vegetative Forms:\r\n\r\nThe _t. d. p._ here is that ~temperature~ which with certainty kills a\r\nwatery suspension of the organisms in question after an exposure of ~10\r\nminutes~.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 155.--Hearson's water-bath.]\r\n\r\n     _Apparatus Required:_\r\n\r\n     Water-bath. For the purpose of observing the thermal\r\n     death-point a special water-bath is necessary. The\r\n     temperature of this piece of apparatus is controlled by\r\n     means of a capsule regulator that can be adjusted for\r\n     intervals of half a degree centigrade through a range of\r\n     30 deg., from 50 deg. C. to 80 deg. C. by means of a spring,\r\n     actuated by the handle a, which increases the pressure\r\n     in the interior of the capsule. A hole is provided for the\r\n     reception of the nozzle of a blast pump, so that a current\r\n     of air may be blown through the water while the bath is in\r\n     use, and thus ensure a uniform temperature of its contents.\r\n     Through a second hole is suspended a certified centigrade\r\n     thermometer, the bulb of which although completely immersed\r\n     in the water is raised at least 2 cm. above the floor of\r\n     the bath.\r\n\r\n     Sterile glass capsules.\r\n\r\n     Flask containing 250 c.c. sterile normal saline solution.\r\n\r\n     Case of sterile pipettes, 10 c.c. (in tenths of a cubic\r\n     centimetre).\r\n\r\n     Special platinum loop.\r\n\r\n     Test-tubes, 18 by 1.5 cm., of thin German glass.\r\n\r\n     Case of sterile petri dishes.\r\n\r\n     Tubes of agar or gelatine.\r\n\r\nMETHOD.--\r\n\r\n1. Prepare tube cultivations on solid media of optimum reaction;\r\nincubate forty-eight hours under optimum conditions as to temperature\r\nand atmosphere.\r\n\r\n2. Examine preparations from the cultivation microscopically to\r\ndetermine the absence of spores.\r\n\r\n3. Pipette 5 c.c. salt solution into each of twelve capsules.\r\n\r\n4. Suspend three loopfuls of the surface growth (using a special\r\nplatinum loop, _vide_ page 316) in the normal saline solution by\r\nemulcifying evenly against the moist walls of each capsule.\r\n\r\n5. Transfer emulsion from each capsule to sterile 250 c.c. flask, and\r\nmix.\r\n\r\n6. Pipette 5 c.c. emulsion into each of twelve sterile test-tubes\r\nnumbered consecutively.\r\n\r\n7. Adjust the first tube in the water-bath, regulated at 40 deg. C, by\r\nmeans of two rubber rings around the tube, one above and the other below\r\nthe perforated top of the bath, so that the upper level of the fluid in\r\nthe tube is about 4 cm. below the surface of the water in the bath, and\r\nthe bottom of the tube is a similar distance above the bottom of the bath.\r\n\r\n8. Arrange a control test-tube containing 5 c.c. sterile saline solution\r\nunder similar conditions. Plug the tube with cotton-wool and pass a\r\nthermometer through the plug so that its bulb is immersed in the water.\r\n\r\n9. Close the unoccupied perforations in the lid of the water-bath by\r\nmeans of glass balls.\r\n\r\n10. Watch the thermometer in the test-tube until it records a\r\ntemperature of 40 deg. C. Note the time. Ten minutes later remove the tube\r\ncontaining the suspension, and cool rapidly by immersing its lower end\r\nin a stream of running water.\r\n\r\n11. Pour three gelatine (or agar) plates containing respectively 0.2,\r\n0.3, and 0.5 c.c. of the suspension, and incubate.\r\n\r\n12. Pipette the remaining 4 c.c. of the suspension into a culture flask\r\ncontaining 250 c.c. of nutrient bouillon, and incubate.\r\n\r\n13. Observe these cultivations from day to day. \"No growth\" must not be\r\nrecorded as final until after the completion of seven days' incubation.\r\n\r\n14. Extend these observations to the remaining tubes of the series, but\r\nvarying the conditions so that each tube is exposed to a temperature 2\r\ndeg. C. higher than the immediately preceding one--i. e., 42 deg. C.,\r\n44 deg. C., 46 deg. C., and so on.\r\n\r\n15. Note that temperature, after exposure to which no growth takes place\r\nup to the end of seven days' incubation, = the thermal death-point.\r\n\r\n16. If greater accuracy is desired, a second series of tubes may be\r\nprepared and exposed for ten minutes to fixed temperatures varying only\r\n0.5 deg. C., through a range of 5 deg. C. on either side of the previously\r\nobserved death-point.\r\n\r\nMoist--Spores: The thermal death-point in the case of spores is that\r\n~time exposure~ to a ~fixed temperature of 100 deg. C.~ necessary to\r\neffect the death of all the spores present in a suspension.\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--If it is desired to retain the ~time constant 10\r\n     minutes~ and investigate the temperature necessary to destroy\r\n     the spores, varying amounts of calcium chloride must be\r\n     added to the water in the bath, when the boiling-point will\r\n     be raised above 100 deg. C. according to the percentage of\r\n     calcium in solution. In such case use the bath figured on\r\n     page 227; the bath figured on page 299 can only be used if\r\n     the capsule is first removed.\r\n\r\nIt is determined in the following manner\r\n\r\n     _Apparatus Required:_\r\n\r\n     Steam-can fitted with a delivery tube and a large bore\r\n     safety-valve tube.\r\n\r\n     Water-bath at 100 deg. C.\r\n\r\n     Erlenmeyer flask, 500 c.c. capacity, containing 140 c.c.\r\n     sterile normal saline solution and fitted with rubber\r\n     stopper perforated with four holes.\r\n\r\n     The rubber stopper is fitted as follows:\r\n\r\n     (a) Thermometer to 120 deg. C., its bulb immersed in the normal\r\n     saline.\r\n\r\n     (b) Straight entry tube, reaching to the bottom of the\r\n     flask, the upper end plugged with cotton-wool.\r\n\r\n     (c) Bent syphon tube, with pipette nozzle attached by means\r\n     of rubber tubing and fitted with pinch-cock.\r\n\r\n     The nozzle is protected from accidental contamination by\r\n     passing it through the cotton-wool plug of a small\r\n     test-tube.\r\n\r\n     (d) A sickle-shaped piece of glass tubing passing just\r\n     through the stopper, plugged with cotton-wool, to act as a\r\n     vent for the steam.\r\n\r\n     Sterile plates.\r\n\r\n     Sterile pipettes.\r\n\r\n     Sterile test-tubes graduated to contain 5 c.c.\r\n\r\n     _Media Required:_\r\n\r\n     Gelatine or agar.\r\n\r\n     Culture flasks containing 200 c.c. nutrient bouillon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 156.--Apparatus arranged for the determination of\r\nthe death-point of spores.]\r\n\r\nMETHOD.--\r\n\r\n1. Prepare twelve tube cultivations upon the surface (or two cultures in\r\nlarge flat culture bottles--_vide_ page 5) of nutrient agar and\r\nincubate under the optimum conditions (previously determined), for the\r\nformation of spores.\r\n\r\nExamine preparations from the cultures microscopically to determine the\r\npresence of spores.\r\n\r\n2. Pipette 5 c.c. sterile normal saline into each culture tube or 30\r\nc.c. into each bottle and by means of a sterile platinum spatula\r\nemulsify the entire surface growth with the solution.\r\n\r\n3. Add the 60 c.c. emulsion to 140 c.c. normal saline contained in the\r\nfitted Erlenmeyer flask.\r\n\r\n4. Place the flask in the water-bath of boiling water.\r\n\r\n5. Connect up the straight tube, after removing the cotton-wool plug,\r\nwith the delivery tube of the steam can; remove the plug from the vent\r\ntube.\r\n\r\n6. When the thermometer reaches 100 deg. C., open the spring clip on the\r\n_syphon_, discard the first cubic centimeter of suspension that syphons\r\nover (i. e., the contents of the syphon tube); collect the next 5 c.c.\r\nof the suspension in the sterile graduated test-tube and pour plates and\r\nprepare flask cultures therefrom as in the previous experiments.\r\n\r\n7. Repeat this process at intervals of twenty-five minutes' steaming.\r\n\r\n8. Observe the inoculated plates and flasks up to the completion, if\r\nnecessary, of seven days' incubation.\r\n\r\n9. Control these experiments, but in this instance syphon off portions\r\nof the suspension at intervals of one-half to one minute during the five\r\nor ten minutes preceding the previously determined death-point.\r\n\r\n_Thermal Death-point._--\r\n\r\nDry--Vegetative Forms: The thermal death-point in this case is that\r\n~temperature~ which with certainty kills a thin film of the organism in\r\nquestion after a time exposure of ~ten minutes~.\r\n\r\n     _Apparatus Required:_\r\n\r\n     Hot-air oven, provided with thermo-regulator.\r\n\r\n     Sterile cover-slips.\r\n\r\n     Flask containing 250 c.c. sterile normal saline solution.\r\n\r\n     Case of sterile pipettes, 10 c.c. (in tenths of a cubic\r\n     centimetre).\r\n\r\n     Case of sterile capsules.\r\n\r\n     Crucible tongs.\r\n\r\nMETHOD.--\r\n\r\n1. Prepare an emulsion with three loopfuls from an optimum cultivation\r\nin 5 c.c. normal saline in a sterile capsule and examine microscopically\r\nto determine the absence of spore forms.\r\n\r\n2. Make twelve cover-slip films on sterile cover-slips; place each in a\r\nsterile capsule to dry.\r\n\r\n3. Expose each capsule in turn in the hot-air oven for ten minutes to a\r\ndifferent fixed temperature, varying 5 deg. C. between 60 deg. C. and\r\n120 deg. C.\r\n\r\n4. Remove each capsule from the oven with crucible tongs immediately\r\nafter the ten minutes are completed; remove the cover-glass from its\r\ninterior with a sterile pair of forceps.\r\n\r\n5. Deposit the film in a flask containing 200 c.c. nutrient bouillon.\r\n\r\n6. Prepare subcultivations from such flasks as show evidence of growth,\r\nto determine that no accidental contamination has taken place but that\r\nthe organism originally spread on the film is responsible for the\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\n7. Control the result of these experiments.\r\n\r\nDry--Spores: The thermal death-point in this case is that ~temperature~\r\nwhich with certainty kills the spores of the organism in question when\r\npresent in a thin film after a time exposure of ~10 minutes~.\r\n\r\n     _Apparatus Required:_\r\n\r\n     As for vegetative forms.\r\n\r\nMETHOD.--\r\n\r\n1. Prepare a sloped agar tube cultivation and incubate under optimum\r\nconditions as to spore formations.\r\n\r\n2. Pipette 5 c.c. sterile normal saline into the culture tube and\r\nemulsify the entire surface growth in it. Examine microscopically to\r\ndetermine the presence of spores in large numbers.\r\n\r\n3. Spread thin even films on twelve sterile cover-slips and place each\r\ncover-slip in a separate sterile capsule.\r\n\r\n4. Expose each capsule in turn for ten minutes to a different fixed\r\ntemperature, varying 5 deg. C, between 100 deg. C. and 160 deg. C.\r\n\r\n5. Complete the examination as for vegetative forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n~III. Reaction of Medium.~\r\n\r\n(A) _Range._--\r\n\r\n1. Prepare a bouillon culture of the organism and incubate, under\r\noptimum conditions as to temperature and atmosphere, for twenty-four\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n2. Pipette 0.1 c.c. of the cultivation into a sterile capsule; add 9.9\r\nc.c. sterile bouillon and mix thoroughly.\r\n\r\n3. Prepare a series of tubes of nutrient bouillon of varying reactions,\r\nfrom +25 to -30 (_vide_ page 155), viz.: +25, +20, +15, +10, +5,\r\nneutral, -5, -10, -15, -20, -25, -30.\r\n\r\n4. Inoculate each of the bouillon tubes with 0.1 c.c. of the diluted\r\ncultivation by means of a sterile graduated pipette and incubate under\r\noptimum conditions.\r\n\r\n5. Observe the cultures at half-hourly intervals from the third to the\r\ntwelfth hours. Note the reaction of the tube or tubes in which growth is\r\nfirst visible macroscopically (probably optimum reaction).\r\n\r\n6. Continue the incubation until the completion, if necessary, of seven\r\ndays. Note the extremes of acidity and alkalinity in which macroscopical\r\ngrowth has developed (Range of reaction).\r\n\r\n7. Control the result of these observations.\r\n\r\n(B) _Optimum Reaction._--The optimum reaction has already been\r\nroughly determined whilst observing the range. It can be fixed within\r\nnarrower limits by inoculating in a similar manner a series of tubes of\r\nbouillon which represent smaller variations in reaction than those\r\npreviously employed (say, 1 instead of 5) for five points on either side\r\nof the previously observed optimum. For example, the optimum reaction\r\nobserved in the set of experiments to determine the range was +10. Now\r\nplant tubes having reactions of +15, +14, +13, +12, +11, +10, +9, +8,\r\n+7, + 6, +5, and observe as before.\r\n\r\n\r\n~IV. Resistance to Lethal Agents.~--\r\n\r\n(A) _Desiccation._--\r\n\r\n     _Apparatus Required:_\r\n\r\n     Mueller's desiccator. This consists of a bell glass fitted\r\n     with an exhaust tube and stop-cock (d), which can be\r\n     secured to a plate-glass base (c) by means of wax or\r\n     grease. It contains a cylindrical vessel of porous clay\r\n     (a) into the top of which pure sulphuric acid is poured\r\n     whilst the material to be dried is placed within its walls\r\n     on a glass shelf (b). The air is exhausted from the\r\n     interior and the acid rapidly converts the clay vessel into\r\n     a large absorbing surface (Fig. 157).\r\n\r\n     Exhaust pump.\r\n\r\n     Pure concentrated sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\n     Sterile cover-slips.\r\n\r\n     Sterile forceps.\r\n\r\n     Culture flask containing 200 c.c. nutrient bouillon.\r\n\r\n     Sterile ventilated Petri dish. This is prepared by bending\r\n     three short pieces of aluminium wire into V shape and\r\n     hanging these on the edge of the lower dish and resting the\r\n     lid upon them (Fig. 158).\r\n\r\nMETHOD.--\r\n\r\n1. Prepare a surface cultivation on nutrient agar in a culture bottle\r\nand incubate under optimum conditions for forty-eight hours.\r\n\r\n2. Examine preparations from the cultivation, microscopically, to\r\ndetermine the absence of spores.\r\n\r\n3. Pipette 5 c.c. sterile normal saline solution into the flask and\r\nsuspend the entire growth in it.\r\n\r\n4. Spread the suspension in thin, even films on sterile cover-slips and\r\ndeposit inside sterile \"plates\" to dry.\r\n\r\n5. As soon as dry, transfer the cover-slip films to the ventilated Petri\r\ndish by means of sterile forceps.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 157.--Mueller's desiccator.]\r\n\r\n6. Place the Petri dish inside the Mueller's desiccator; fill the upper\r\nchamber with pure sulphuric acid, cover with the bell jar, and exhaust\r\nthe air from its interior. Ten minutes later connect up the desiccator\r\nto a sulphuric acid wash-bottle interposing an air filter so that only\r\ndry sterile air enters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 158.--Petri dish for drying cultivations.]\r\n\r\n7. At intervals of five hours open the apparatus, remove one of the\r\ncover-slip films from the Petri dish, and transfer it to the interior of\r\na culture flask, with every precaution against contamination. Reseal the\r\ndesiccator and again exhaust, and subsequently admit dry sterile air as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n8. Incubate the culture flask under optimum conditions until the\r\ncompletion of seven days, if necessary; and determine the time exposure\r\nat which death occurs.\r\n\r\n9. Pour plates from those culture flasks which grow, to determine the\r\nabsence of contamination.\r\n\r\n10. Repeat these observations at hourly intervals for the five hours\r\npreceding and succeeding the death time, as determined in the first set\r\nof experiments.\r\n\r\n(B) _Light._--\r\n\r\n(a) Diffuse Daylight:\r\n\r\n1. Prepare a tube cultivation in nutrient bouillon, and incubate under\r\noptimum conditions, for forty-eight hours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 159.--Plate with star for testing effect of light.]\r\n\r\n2. Pour twenty plate cultivations, ten of nutrient gelatine and ten of\r\nnutrient agar, each containing 0.1 c.c. of the bouillon culture.\r\n\r\n3. Place one agar plate and one gelatine plate into the hot and cold\r\nincubators, respectively, as _controls_.\r\n\r\n4. Fasten a piece of black paper, cut the shape of a cross or star, on\r\nthe centre of the cover of each of the remaining plates (Fig. 159).\r\n\r\n5. Expose these plates to the action of diffuse daylight (not direct\r\nsunlight) in the laboratory for one, two, three, four, five, six, eight,\r\nten, twelve hours.\r\n\r\n6. After exposure to light, incubate under optimum conditions.\r\n\r\n7. Examine the plate cultivations after twenty-four and forty-eight\r\nhours' incubation, and compare with the two controls. Record results. If\r\ngrowth is absent from that portion of the plate unprotected by the black\r\npaper, continue the incubation and daily observation until the end of\r\nseven days.\r\n\r\n8. Control the results.\r\n\r\n(b) Direct Sunlight:\r\n\r\n1. Prepare plate cultivations precisely as in the former experiments and\r\nplace the two controls in the incubators.\r\n\r\n2. Arrange the remaining plates upon a platform in the direct rays of\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\n3. On the top of each plate stand a small glass dish 14 cm. in diameter\r\nand 5 cm. deep.\r\n\r\n4. Fill a solution of potash alum (2 per cent. in distilled water) into\r\neach dish to the depth of 2 cm. to absorb the heat of the sun's rays and\r\nso eliminate possible effects of temperature on the cultivations.\r\n\r\n5. After exposures for periods similar to those employed in the\r\npreceding experiment, incubate and complete the observation as above.\r\n\r\n(c) Primary Colours: Each colour--violet, blue, green and red--must be\r\ntested separately.\r\n\r\n1. Prepare plate cultivations, as in the previous \"light\" experiments,\r\nand incubate controls.\r\n\r\n2. Fasten a strip of black paper, 3 cm. wide, across one diameter of the\r\ncover of each plate.\r\n\r\n3. Coat the remainder of the surface of the cover with a film of pure\r\nphotographic collodion which contains 2 per cent. of either of the\r\nfollowing aniline dyes, as may be necessary:\r\n\r\n    Chrysoidin (for red).\r\n    Malachite green (for green).\r\n    Eosin, bluish (for blue).\r\n    Methyl violet (for violet).\r\n\r\n4. Expose the plates, thus prepared, to bright daylight (but not direct\r\nsunlight) for varying periods, and complete the observations as in the\r\npreceding experiments. The bactericidal action of light appears to\r\ndepend upon the more refrangible rays of the violet end of the spectrum\r\nand is noted whether the red yellow rays are transmitted or not.\r\n\r\n5. Control the results.\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--The ultra-violet rays obtained from a quartz mercury\r\n     vapour lamp destroy bacterial life with great rapidity under\r\n     laboratory conditions.\r\n\r\n(C) _Heat._--(_Vide_ Thermal Death-point, page 298.)\r\n\r\n(D) _Antiseptics and Disinfectants._--The resistance exhibited by any\r\ngiven bacterium toward any specified disinfectant or germicide should be\r\ninvestigated with reference to the following points:\r\n\r\n(A) ~Inhibition coefficient~--i. e., that _percentage of the\r\ndisinfectant_ present in the nutrient medium which is sufficient to\r\nprevent the growth and multiplication of the bacterium.\r\n\r\n(B) ~Inferior lethal coefficient~--i. e., the _time exposure_ necessary\r\nto kill _vegetative forms_ of the bacterium suspended in water at\r\n20 deg. to 25 deg.

One-tenth per cent. aqueous solution of formaldehyde.\r\n\r\nMETHOD.--\r\n\r\n1. Number six bouillon tubes consecutively 1 to 6. Inoculate each from\r\nthe stock cultivation of B. anthracis and at once add varying\r\nquantities[10] of the carbolic acid solution, viz.:\r\n\r\n    To tube 1 add 2.0 c.c. (= 1:100)\r\n    To tube 2 add 1.0 c.c. (= 1:200)\r\n    To tube 3 add 0.6 c.c. (= 1:300)\r\n    To tube 4 add 0.5 c.c. (= 1:400)\r\n    To tube 5 add 0.4 c.c. (= 1:500)\r\n    To tube 6 add 0.2 c.c. (= 1:1,000)\r\n\r\n2. Prepare a similar series of tube cultivations numbered consecutively\r\n7 to 12 and add varying quantities of the mercuric perchloride solution,\r\nviz.:\r\n\r\n    To tube  7 add 0.1   (= 1:1,000)\r\n    To tube  8 add 0.05  (= 1:2,000)\r\n    To tube  9 add 0.03  (= 1:3,000)\r\n    To tube 10 add 0.025 (= 1:4,000)\r\n    To tube 11 add 0.02  (= 1:5,000)\r\n    To tube 12 add 0.01  (= 1:10,000)\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Prepare a similar series of tube cultivations numbered consecutively\r\n13 to 18 and add varying quantities of the formaldehyde solution, viz.:\r\n\r\n    To tube No. 13 add 1.0   c.c.

Examine each of the culture tubes from day to day, until the\r\ncompletion of seven days, and note those tubes, if any, in which growth\r\ntakes place.\r\n\r\n6. From such tubes as show growth prepare subcultivations upon suitable\r\nmedia, and ascertain that the organism causing the growth is the one\r\noriginally employed in the test and not an accidental contamination.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Inferior Lethal Coefficient.~--\r\n\r\n     _Apparatus Required:_\r\n\r\n     Highly concentrated solutions of the disinfectants.\r\n\r\n     Sterile test-tubes in which to make dilutions from the\r\n     concentrated solutions of the disinfectants.\r\n\r\n     Hanging-drop slides.\r\n\r\n     Cover-slips.\r\n\r\n     Erlenmeyer flask containing 100 c.c. sterile distilled\r\n     water.\r\n\r\n     Case of sterile pipettes, 10 c.c.

Prepare a surface cultivation of the \"test\" organism B. anthracis\r\nupon nutrient agar in a culture bottle and incubate under optimum\r\nconditions for twenty-four hours; then examine the cultivation\r\nmicroscopically to determine the absence of spores.\r\n\r\n2. Prepare solutions of different percentages of each disinfectant.\r\n\r\n3. Make a series of hanging-drop preparations from the agar culture,\r\nusing a loopful of disinfectant solution of the different percentages to\r\nprepare the emulsion on each cover-slip.\r\n\r\n4. Examine microscopically and note the strongest solution which does\r\nnot cause plasmolysis and the weakest solution which does plasmolyse the\r\norganism.\r\n\r\n5. Make control preparations of these two solutions and determine the\r\npercentage to be tested.\r\n\r\n6. Pipette 10 c.c. sterile water into the culture bottle and suspend the\r\nentire surface growth in it.\r\n\r\n7. Transfer the suspension to the Erlenmeyer flask and mix it with the\r\n90 c.c. of sterile water remaining in the flask.\r\n\r\n8. Pipette 10 c.c. of the diluted suspension into each of ten sterile\r\ntest-tubes.\r\n\r\n9. Label one of the tubes \"Control\" and place it in the incubator at\r\n18 deg. C.\r\n\r\n10. Add to each of the remaining tubes a sufficient quantity[11] of a\r\nconcentrated solution of the disinfectant to produce the percentage\r\npreviously determined upon (_vide_ step 5).\r\n\r\n11. Incubate the tubes at 18 deg. C. to 20 deg. C.\r\n\r\n12. At hourly intervals remove the control tube and one of the tubes\r\nwith added disinfectant from the incubator.\r\n\r\n13. Make a subcultivation from both the control and the test suspension,\r\nupon the surface of nutrient agar; incubate under optimum conditions.\r\n\r\n14. Observe these culture tubes from day to day until the completion of\r\nseven days, and determine the shortest exposure necessary to cause the\r\ndeath of vegetative forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Superior Lethal Coefficient.~--\r\n\r\n1. Prepare surface cultivations of the \"test\" organisms upon nutrient\r\nagar in a culture bottle, and incubate under optimum conditions, for\r\nthree days, for the formation of their spores.\r\n\r\n2. Transfer the emulsion to a sterile test-tube and heat in the\r\ndifferential steriliser for ten minutes at 80 deg. C. to destroy all\r\nvegetative forms.\r\n\r\n3. Employing that percentage solution of the disinfectant determined in\r\nthe previous experiment, and complete the investigations as detailed\r\ntherein, steps 7 to 14, increasing the interval between planting the\r\nsubcultivations to two, three, or five hours if considered advisable.\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--Where it is necessary to leave the organisms in\r\n     contact with a strong solution of the disinfectant for\r\n     lengthy periods, some means must be adopted to remove every\r\n     trace of the disinfectant from the bacteria before\r\n     transferring them to fresh culture media; otherwise,\r\n     although not actually killed, the presence of the\r\n     disinfectant may prevent their development, and so give rise\r\n     to an erroneous conclusion. Consequently it is essential in\r\n     all germicidal experiments to determine first of all the\r\n     inhibition coefficient of the germicide employed. Under the\r\n     circumstances referred to above it is usually sufficient to\r\n     prepare the subcultures in such a volume of fluid nutrient\r\n     medium as would suffice to reduce the concentration of the\r\n     germicide to about one hundredth of the inhibition\r\n     percentage, assuming that the entire bulk of inoculum was\r\n     made up of that strength of germicide employed in the test.\r\n     In some cases it is a simple matter to neutralise the\r\n     germicide and render it inert by washing the organisms in\r\n     some non-germicidal solution (such for example as ammonium\r\n     sulphide when using mercurial salts as the germicide). When,\r\n     however, it is desired to remove the last traces of\r\n     germicide proceed as follows:\r\n\r\n     1. Transfer the suspension of bacteria to sterile\r\n     centrifugal tubes; add the required amount of disinfectant,\r\n     and allow it to remain in contact with the bacteria for the\r\n     necessary period.\r\n\r\n     2. Centrifugalise thoroughly, pipette off the supernatant\r\n     fluid; fill the tube with sterile water and distribute the\r\n     deposit evenly throughout the fluid.\r\n\r\n     3. Centrifugalise again, pipette off the supernatant fluid;\r\n     fill the tube with sterile water; distribute the deposit\r\n     evenly throughout the fluid, and transfer the suspension to\r\n     a litre flask.\r\n\r\n     4. Make up to a litre by the addition of sterile water;\r\n     filter the suspension through a sterile porcelain candle.\r\n\r\n     5. Emulsify the bacterial residue with 5 c.c. sterile\r\n     bouillon.\r\n\r\n     6. Prepare the necessary subcultivations from this emulsion.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATHOGENESIS.\r\n\r\n_Living Bacteria._--\r\n\r\n(a) Psychrophilic Bacteria: When the organism will only grow at or below\r\n18 deg. to 20 deg. C.,\r\n\r\n1. Prepare cultivations in nutrient broth and incubate under optimum\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n2. After seven days' incubation inject that amount of the culture\r\ncorresponding to 1 per cent. of the body-weight of a healthy frog, into\r\nthe reptile's dorsal lymph sac.\r\n\r\n3. Observe until death takes place, or, in the event of a negative\r\nresult, until the completion of twenty-eight days (_vide_ Chapter\r\nXVIII).\r\n\r\n4. If, and when, death occurs, make a careful post-mortem examination\r\n(_vide_ Chapter XIX).\r\n\r\n(b) Mesophilic Bacteria: When the organism grows at 35 deg. to 37 deg. C.,\r\n\r\n1. Prepare cultivations in nutrient broth and incubate under optimum\r\nconditions for forty-eight hours.\r\n\r\n2. Select two white mice, as nearly as possible of the same age, size,\r\nand weight.\r\n\r\n3. Inoculate the first mouse, subcutaneously at the root of the tail,\r\nwith an amount of cultivation equivalent to 1 per cent. of its\r\nbody-weight.\r\n\r\n4. Inoculate the second mouse intraperitoneally with a similar dose.\r\n\r\n5. Observe carefully until death occurs, or until the lapse of\r\ntwenty-eight days.\r\n\r\n6. If the inoculated animals succumb, make complete post-mortem\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nIf death follows shortly after the injection of cultivations of\r\nbacteria, the inoculation experiments should be repeated two or three\r\ntimes. Then, if the organism under observation invariably exhibits\r\npathogenic effects, steps should be taken to ascertain, if possible, the\r\nminimal lethal dose (_vide infra_) of the growth upon solid media for\r\nthe frog or white mouse respectively. Other experimental animals--_e.\r\ng._, the white rat, guinea-pig, and rabbit--should next be tested in a\r\nsimilar manner.\r\n\r\n7. If the inoculated mice are unaffected, test the action of the\r\norganism in question upon white rats, guinea-pigs, rabbits, etc.\r\n\r\n_Minimal Lethal Dose_ (_m. l. d._); If the purpose of the inoculation is\r\nto determine the minimal lethal dose, a slightly different procedure\r\nmust be followed. For this and other exact experiments a special\r\nplatinum loop is manufactured, some 2.5 mm. by 0.75 mm., with parallel\r\nsides, and calibrated by careful weighing, to determine approximately\r\nthe amount of moist bacterial growth, the loop will hold when filled.\r\n\r\n1. The cultivation must be prepared on a solid medium of the optimum\r\nreaction, incubated at the optimum temperature, and injected at the\r\nperiod of greatest activity and vigour, of the particular organism it is\r\ndesired to test.\r\n\r\n2. Arrange four sterile capsules in a row and label them I, II, III, and\r\nIV. Into the first deliver 10 c.c. sterile bouillon by means of a\r\nsterile graduated pipette; and into each of the remaining three, 9.9\r\nc.c.\r\n\r\n3. Remove one loopful of the bacterial growth from the surface of the\r\nmedium in the culture tube, observing the usual precautions against\r\ncontamination, and emulsify it evenly with the bouillon in the first\r\ncapsule. Each cubic centimetre of the emulsion will now contain\r\none-tenth of the organisms contained in the original loopful (written\r\nshortly 0.1 loop).\r\n\r\n4. Remove 0.1 c.c. of the emulsion in the first capsule by means of a\r\nsterile graduated pipette and transfer it to the second capsule and mix\r\nthoroughly. Drop the infected pipette into a jar of lysol solution. This\r\nmakes up the bulk of the fluid in the second capsule to 10 c.c., and\r\ntherefore every cubic centimetre of bouillon in capsule II contains\r\n0.001 loop.\r\n\r\n5. Similarly, 0.1 c.c. of the mixture is transferred from capsule II to\r\ncapsule III (1 c.c. of bouillon in capsule III contains 0.00001 loop),\r\nand then from capsule III to capsule IV (1 c.c. of bouillon in capsule\r\nIV contains 0.0000001 loop).\r\n\r\nThe dilutions thus prepared may be summarised in a table;\r\n\r\nCapsule   I = 1 loopful + 10 c.c. water             [.'.] 1 c.c.=0.1 loop.\r\nCapsule  II = 0.1 c.c. capsule I + 9.9 c.c. water   [.'.] 1 c.c.=0.001 loop.\r\nCapsule III = 0.1 c.c. capsule II + 9.9 c.c. water  [.'.] 1 c.c.=0.00001 loop.\r\nCapsule  IV = 0.1 c.c. capsule III + 9.9 c.c. water\r\n      [.'.] 1 c.c. = 0.0000001 loop.\r\n\r\n6. With sterile graduated pipettes remove the necessary quantity of\r\nbouillon corresponding to the various divisors of ten of the loop from\r\nthe respective capsules, and transfer each \"dose\" to a separate sterile\r\ncapsule and label; and to such doses as are small in bulk, add the\r\nnecessary quantity of sterile bouillon to make up to 1 c.c.\r\n\r\n7. Multiples of the loop are prepared by emulsifying 1, 2, 5, or 10\r\nloops each with 1 c.c. sterile bouillon in separate sterile capsules.\r\n\r\n8. Inoculate a series of animals with these measured doses, filling the\r\nsyringe first from that capsule containing the smallest dose, then from\r\nthe capsule containing the next smallest, and so on. If care is taken,\r\nit will not be found necessary to sterilise the syringe during the\r\nseries of inoculations.\r\n\r\n9. Plant tubes of gelatine or agar, liquefied by heat, from each of the\r\nhigher dilutions, say from 0.0000001 loop to 0.01 loop; pour plates and\r\nincubate. When growth is visible enumerate the number of organisms\r\npresent in each, average up and calculate the number of bacteria present\r\nin one loopful of the inoculum.\r\n\r\n10. The smallest dose which causes the infection and death of the\r\ninoculated animal is noted as the minimal lethal dose.\r\n\r\n_Toxins._--\r\n\r\nPrepare flask cultivations of the organism under observation in glucose\r\nformate broth, and incubate for fourteen days under optimum conditions.\r\n\r\n(a) Intracellular or Insoluble Toxins:\r\n\r\n1. Heat the fluid culture in a water-bath at 60 deg. C. for thirty\r\nminutes. (The resulting sterile, turbid fluid is often spoken of as\r\n\"killed\" culture,)\r\n\r\n2. Inoculate a tube of sterile bouillon with a similar quantity, and\r\nincubate under optimum conditions. This \"control\" then serves to\r\ndemonstrate the freedom of the toxin from living bacteria.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 160.--Apparatus arrange for toxin filtration.]\r\n\r\n3. Inject intraveneously that amount of the cultivation corresponding to\r\n1 per cent. of the body-weight of the selected animal, usually one of\r\nthe small rodents.\r\n\r\n4. Observe during life or until the completion of twenty-eight days, and\r\nin the event of death occurring during that period, make a complete\r\npost-mortem examination.\r\n\r\n5. Repeat the experiment at least once. In the event of a positive\r\nresult estimate the minimal lethal dose of \"killed\" culture for each of\r\nthe species of animals experimented upon.\r\n\r\n(b) Extracellular or Soluble Toxins:\r\n\r\n1. Filter the cultivation through a porcelain filter candle (Berkefeld)\r\ninto a sterile filter flask, arranging the apparatus as in the\r\naccompanying figure (Fig. 160).\r\n\r\n2. Inoculate mice, rats, guinea-pigs, and rabbits subcutaneously with\r\nthat quantity of toxin corresponding to 1 per cent. of the body-weight\r\nof each respectively, and observe, if necessary, until the completion of\r\none month.\r\n\r\n3. Inoculate a \"control\" tube of bouillon with a similar quantity and\r\nincubate, to determine the freedom of the filtered toxin from living\r\nbacteria.\r\n\r\n4. In the event of a fatal termination make complete and careful\r\npost-mortem examinations.\r\n\r\n5. Repeat the experiments and, if the results are positive, ascertain\r\nthe minimal lethal dose of toxin for each of the susceptible animals.\r\n\r\nThe estimation of the _m. l. d._ of a toxin is carried out on lines\r\nsimilar to those laid down for living bacteria (_vide_ page 316) merely\r\nsubstituting 1 c.c. of toxin as the unit in place of the unit \"loopful\"\r\nof living culture.\r\n\r\nIt frequently happens, during the course of casual investigations that a\r\nbouillon-tube culture is available for a toxin test whilst a flask\r\ncultivation is not. In such cases, Martin's small filter candle and tube\r\n(Fig. 161) specially designed for the filtration of small quantities of\r\nfluid, is invaluable. This consists of a narrow filter flask just large\r\nenough to accommodate an ordinary 18 x 2 cm. test-tube. The mouth of the\r\ntubular Chamberland candle 15 x 1.5 cm. is closed by a perforated rubber\r\ncork into which fits the end of the stem of a thistle headed funnel,\r\nwhilst immediately below the butt of the funnel is situated a rubber\r\ncork to close the mouth of the filter flask. When the apparatus is fixed\r\nin position and connected to an exhaust pump, the cultivation is poured\r\ninto the head of the funnel and owing to the relatively large filtering\r\nsurface the germ free filtrate is rapidly drawn through into the\r\ntest-tube receiver.\r\n\r\n~Raising the Virulence of an Organism.~--If it is desired to raise or\r\n\"exalt\" the virulence of a feebly pathogenic organism, special methods\r\nof inoculation are necessary, carefully adjusted to the exigencies of\r\neach individual case. Among the most important are the following:\r\n\r\n1. _Passage of Virus._--The inoculation of pure cultivations of the\r\norganism into highly susceptible animals, and passing it as rapidly as\r\npossible from animal to animal, always selecting that method of\r\ninoculation-e. g., intraperitoneal--which places the organism under\r\nthe most favorable conditions for its growth and multiplication.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 161--Martin's filtering apparatus for small\r\nquantities of fluid.]\r\n\r\n2. _Virus Plus Virulent Organisms._--The inoculation of pure\r\ncultivations of the organism together with pure cultivations of some\r\nother microbe which in itself is sufficiently virulent to ensure the\r\ndeath of the experimental animal, either into the same situation or into\r\nsome other part of the body. By this association the organism of low\r\nvirulence will frequently acquire a higher degree of virulence, which\r\nmay be still further raised by means of \"passages\" (_vide supra_).\r\n\r\n3. _Virus Plus Toxins._--The inoculation of pure cultivations of the\r\norganism into some selected situation, together with the subcutaneous,\r\nintraperitoneal, or intravenous injection of a toxin--e. g., one of\r\nthose elaborated by the proteus group--either simultaneously with,\r\nbefore, or immediately after, the injection of the feeble virus. By\r\nthis means the natural resistance of the animal is lowered, and the\r\norganism inoculated is enabled to multiply and produce its pathogenic\r\neffect, its virulence being subsequently exalted by means of \"passages.\"\r\n\r\n~Attenuating the Virulence of an Organism.~--Attenuating or lowering the\r\nvirulence of a pathogenic microbe is usually attained with much less\r\ndifficulty than the exaltation of its virulence, and is generally\r\neffected by varying the environment of the cultivations, as for example:\r\n\r\n1. Cultivating in such media as are unsuitable by reason of their (a)\r\ncomposition or (b) reaction.\r\n\r\n2. Cultivating in suitable media, but at an unsuitable temperature.\r\n\r\n3. Cultivating in suitable media, but in an unsuitable atmosphere.\r\n\r\n4. Cultivation in suitable media, but under unfavorable conditions as to\r\nlight, motion, etc.\r\n\r\nAttenuation of the virus can also be secured by\r\n\r\n5. Passage through naturally resistant animals.\r\n\r\n6. Exposure to desiccation.\r\n\r\n7. Exposure to gaseous disinfectants.\r\n\r\n8. By a combination of two or more of the above methods.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMMUNISATION.\r\n\r\nThe further study of the pathogenetic powers of any particular bacterium\r\ninvolves the active immunisation of one or more previously normal\r\nanimals. This end may be attained by various means; but it must be\r\nremembered that immunisation is not carried out by any hard and fast\r\nrule or by one method alone, but usually by a combination of methods\r\nadapted to the exigencies of each particular case. The ordinary methods\r\ninclude:\r\n\r\n     A. Active Immunisation.\r\n\r\n     I. By inoculation with dead bacteria (i. e., bacteria\r\n     killed by heat; the action of ultra-violet rays, of chemical\r\n     germicides, or by autolysis).\r\n\r\n     II. By the inoculation of attenuated strains of bacteria.\r\n\r\n     III. By the inoculation of living virulent bacteria (exalted\r\n     in virulence if necessary).\r\n\r\n     B. Combined Active and Passive Immunisation:\r\n\r\n     IV. By the inoculation of toxin-antitoxin mixtures.\r\n\r\n\r\nACTIVE IMMUNISATION.\r\n\r\nThe immunisation of the rabbit against the Diplococcus pneumoniae may be\r\ninstanced as an example of the general methods of immunisation of\r\nlaboratory animals.\r\n\r\n1. Take a full grown rabbit weighing not less than 1200 to 1500 grammes\r\n(large rabbits of 2000 grammes and over are the most suitable for\r\nimmunising experiments). Observe weight and temperature carefully during\r\nthe few days occupied in the following steps.\r\n\r\n2. Inoculate a small rabbit intraperitoneally with one or two loopfuls\r\nof a twenty-four-hour-old blood agar cultivation of a _virulent_ strain\r\nof Diplococcus pneumoniae.\r\n\r\nDeath should follow within twenty-four hours, and in any case will not\r\nbe delayed beyond forty-eight hours.\r\n\r\n3. Under aseptic precautions, at the post-mortem, transfer a loopful of\r\nheart blood to an Erlenmeyer flask containing 50 c.c. sterile nutrient\r\nbroth. Incubate at 37 deg. C. for twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n4. Prepare also several blood agar cultures from the heart blood of the\r\nrabbit, label them all O.C. (original culture). After twenty-four hours\r\nincubation at 37 deg. C. place an india-rubber cap over the plugged mouth\r\nof the tube of all but one of these cultures and paint the cap with Canada\r\nbalsam or shellac varnish, dry, and replace in the hot incubator.\r\n\r\nThis will prevent evaporation, and cultures thus sealed will remain\r\nunaltered in virulence for a considerable time.\r\n\r\n5. Make a fresh subcultivation on blood agar from the uncapped O.C.\r\ncultivation and after twenty-four hours incubation at 37 deg. C.\r\ndetermine the minimal lethal dose of this strain upon a series of mice\r\n(see page 316).\r\n\r\n6. Suspend the flask containing the twenty-four-hour-old broth culture\r\n(step 3) in the water-bath at 60 deg. C. for one hour. Cool the flask\r\nrapidly under a stream of cold water.\r\n\r\n7. Determine the sterility of this (?) killed cultivation by\r\ntransferring one cubic centimetre to each of several tubes of nutrient\r\nbroth, and incubate at 37 deg. C. for twenty-four hours. If growth of\r\nDiplococcus pneumoniae occurs, again heat culture in water-bath at 60\r\ndeg. C. for one hour and again test for sterility.\r\n\r\n8. Inject the selected rabbit intravenously (see page 363) with 2 c.c.\r\nof the killed cultivation, and inject a further 10 c.c. into the\r\nperitoneal cavity.\r\n\r\nDuring the next few days the animal will lose some weight and perhaps\r\nshow a certain amount of pyrexia.\r\n\r\n9. When the temperature and weight have again returned to\r\nnormal--generally about seven days after the inoculation--again inject\r\nkilled cultivation, this time giving a dose of 5 c.c. intravenously and\r\n20 c.c. intraperitoneally. A temperature and weight reaction similar to,\r\nbut less marked than that following the first injection will probably be\r\nobserved, but after about a week's interval the animal will be ready for\r\nthe next injection.\r\n\r\n10. When ready to give the third injection prepare a fresh blood agar\r\nsubculture from another O.C. tube and after twenty-four hours incubation\r\nprepare a minimal lethal dose (as determined in 5) and inject it\r\nsubcutaneously into the rabbit's abdominal wall.\r\n\r\nA slight local reaction will probably be observed as well as the weight\r\nand temperature reactions.\r\n\r\n11. A week to ten days later inject a similar minimal lethal dose into\r\nthe peritoneal cavity.\r\n\r\n12. Observe the weight and temperature of the rabbit very carefully, and\r\nregulating the dates of inoculation by the animal's general condition,\r\ncontinue to inject living cultivations of the pneumococcus into the\r\nperitoneal cavity, gradually increasing the dose by multiples of ten.\r\n\r\n13. At intervals of two months samples of blood may be collected from\r\nthe posterior auricular vein and the serum tested for specific\r\nantibodies.\r\n\r\n14. Under favourable conditions it will be found after some six months\r\nsteady work that the rabbit may be injected intraperitoneally with an\r\nentire blood agar cultivation without any ill effects being apparent;\r\nand this characteristic--resistance to the lethal effects of large doses\r\nof the virus--is the sole criterion of _immunity_. Further, the serum\r\nseparated from blood withdrawn from the animal about a week after an\r\ninjection, if used in doses of .01 c.c., will protect a mouse against\r\nthe lethal effects of at least ten minimal lethal doses of living\r\npneumococci.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing illustration it has been assumed that complete acquired\r\nactive immunity has been conferred upon the experimental rabbit in\r\nconsequence of the formation of antibody, specific to the diplococcus\r\npneumoniac, sufficient in amount to ensure the destruction of enormous\r\ndoses of the living cocci--the _antigen_ (that is the substance injected\r\nin response to which _antibody_ has been elaborated) in this particular\r\ncase being the bacterial protoplasm of the pneumococcus with its\r\nendo-toxins.\r\n\r\nBut provided death does not immediately follow the injection of the\r\nantigen, specific antibody is always formed in greater or lesser amount;\r\nand in experimental work a sufficient amount of any required antibody\r\ncan often be obtained without carrying the process of immunisation to\r\nits logical termination.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if the immunisation of a rabbit toward Bacillus typhosus\r\nis commenced on the lines already set out it will often be found, after\r\na few injections of \"killed\" cultivation that the blood serum of the\r\nanimal (even when diluted with several hundred times its volume of\r\nnormal saline) contains specific agglutinin for B. typhosus--and if the\r\nsole object of the experiment has been the preparation of agglutinin the\r\ninoculations may well be stopped at this point, although the animal is\r\nnot yet immune in the strict meaning of the word.\r\n\r\nAgain, antibodies may be formed in response to antigens other than\r\ninfective particles--thus the injection into suitable animals of foreign\r\nproteins such as egg albumin, heterologous blood sera or red blood discs\r\nfrom a different species of animal, will result in the formation of\r\nspecific antibodies possessing definite affinities for their respective\r\nantigens.\r\n\r\nThe most important antibody of this latter type is Haemolysin, a\r\nsubstance that makes its appearance in the blood serum of an animal\r\npreviously injected with washed blood cells from an animal of a\r\ndifferent species. The serum from such an animal possesses the power of\r\ndisintegrating red blood discs of the variety employed as antigen and\r\ncausing the discharge of their contained haemoglobin, and is specific in\r\nits action to the extent of failing to exert any injurious effect upon\r\nthe red blood cells of any other species of animal.\r\n\r\nThe action of this serum is due to the presence of two distinct bodies,\r\ncomplement and haemolysin.\r\n\r\n_Complement_ (or alexine) is a thermo-labile readily oxidised body\r\npresent in variable but unalterable amount in the normal serum of every\r\nanimal. It is a substance which exerts a lytic effect upon all foreign\r\nmatter introduced into the blood or tissues; but by itself is a\r\ncomparatively inert body, and is only capable of exerting its maximum\r\nlytic effect in the presence of and in combination with a specific\r\nantibody, or immune body.\r\n\r\nComplement is obtained (unmixed with antibody) by collecting fresh blood\r\nserum from any healthy normal (that is uninoculated) animal.\r\nGuinea-pigs' serum is that most frequently employed for experimental\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n_Haemolysin_ (immune body, copula, sensitising body, amboceptor) is a\r\n_thermostable_ antibody formed in response to the injection of red cells\r\nwhich although in itself inert is capable of linking up complement\r\npresent in the normal serum to the red cells of the variety used as\r\nantigen--a combination resulting in haemolysis.\r\n\r\nHaemolysin is obtained by collecting fresh blood serum from a suitably\r\ninoculated animal and exposing it to a temperature of 56 deg. C. (to\r\ndestroy the thermo-labile complement) for 15 to 30 minutes before use.\r\nIt is then referred to as _inactivated_, and is _reactivated_ by the\r\naddition of fresh normal serum--that is serum containing complement.\r\n\r\nHaemolysin is of importance academically owing to the fact that many of\r\nthe problems of immunity have been elucidated by its aid; but its\r\npresent practical importance lies in the application of the _haemolytic\r\nsystem_ (that is haemolysin, corresponding erythrocyte solution and\r\ncomplement) to certain laboratory methods having for their object either\r\nthe identification of the infective entity or the diagnosis of the\r\nexistence of infection.\r\n\r\nFor use in these laboratory methods of diagnosis it is most convenient\r\nto prepare haemolytic serum specific for human blood--whether the\r\nlaboratory is isolated or attached to a large hospital. Ox blood, sheep\r\nblood or goat blood if readily obtainable, may however be used instead,\r\nand although the following method is directed to the preparation of\r\nhuman haemolysin the same procedure serves in all cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PREPARATION OF HAEMOLYTIC SERUM.\r\n\r\n_Apparatus Required:_\r\n\r\n    Small centrifuge, preferably electrically driven, with two\r\n      receptacles for tubes, and enclosed in a safety shield (Fig. 162).\r\n    Sterile centrifuge tubes (10 c.c. capacity), Fig. 163.\r\n    Sterile pipettes (10 c.c. graduated) in case.\r\n    Sterile glass capsules (in case).\r\n    Sterile test-tubes.\r\n    Sterile all glass syringe (5 c.c. or 10 c.c. capacity)\r\n      and needle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 162.--Small electrical centrifuge.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 163.--Centrifuge tube.]\r\n\r\n_Reagents Required:_\r\n\r\n    Normal saline solution.\r\n    10 per cent. sodium citrate solution in normal saline.\r\n    Human blood (_vide infra_).\r\n\r\nMETHOD.--\r\n\r\n1. Select a healthy full-grown rabbit of not less than 2500 grammes\r\nweight in accordance with the directions already given (page 322) and\r\nprepare it for intraperitoneal inoculation.\r\n\r\n2. Measure out 2 c.c. citrated human blood (collected at a surgical\r\noperation or a venesection, or withdrawn by venipuncture from the median\r\nbasilic or median cephalic vein of a normal adult) into a centrifuge\r\ntube and centrifugalise thoroughly.\r\n\r\n3. Wash with three changes of normal saline (_vide_ also page 388).\r\n\r\n4. Transfer the washed cells to a sterile capsule by means of a sterile\r\npipette. Add 5 c.c. of normal saline and mix thoroughly.\r\n\r\n5. Take up the mixture of cells and saline in the all-glass syringe and\r\ninject into the peritoneal cavity of the rabbit.\r\n\r\n6. Seven days later inject intraperitoneally the washed cells from 5\r\nc.c. human blood mixed with 5 c.c. normal saline.\r\n\r\n7. Seven days later inject the washed cells from 10 c.c. human blood\r\nmixed with 5 c.c. normal saline.\r\n\r\n8. After a further interval of seven days repeat the injection of washed\r\ncells from 10 c.c. human blood mixed with 5 c.c. normal saline.\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--Better results are obtained if the second and\r\n     subsequent injections are made intravenously, even when\r\n     smaller quantities of washed red cells are employed. If,\r\n     however, the intravenous route is selected exceeding great\r\n     care must be exercised to avoid the introduction of air into\r\n     the vein--an accident which is followed, within a few\r\n     minutes, by the death of the rabbit from pulmonary embolism.\r\n\r\n9. Allow five days to elapse, then collect a preliminary sample of\r\nblood, say about 2 c.c., from the rabbit's ear. Allow it to clot,\r\nseparate off the serum and transfer to a sterile test-tube. Place the\r\ntest-tube in a water-bath at 56 deg. C. for fifteen minutes (to\r\ninactivate) and test the serum quantitatively for haemolytic properties\r\nin the following manner:\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TITRATION OF HAEMOLYTIC SERUM.\r\n\r\n_Apparatus Required:_\r\n\r\n    Electrical centrifuge.\r\n    Sterile centrifuge tubes.\r\n    Water-bath regulated at 56 deg.

Fresh guinea-pig serum in test-tube labelled\r\n     C.\r\n\r\n     Kill a normal guinea-pig with chloroform vapour.\r\n\r\n     Open the thorax with all aseptic precautions, and collect as\r\n     much blood as possible from the heart with a sterile Pasteur\r\n     pipette.\r\n\r\n     Transfer it to a sterile centrifuge tube and place the tube\r\n     in the incubator at 37 deg.

Take two test-tubes and number them 1 and 2, and pipette into each 9\r\nc.c. of normal saline solution.\r\n\r\n2. Add 1 c.c. of haemolytic rabbit serum to tube No. 1 and mix\r\nthoroughly: take up 1 c.c. of the mixture and add it to tube No. 2; mix\r\nthoroughly.\r\n\r\n3. Set up ten small test-tubes in test-tube rack or in roll of\r\nplasticine, and number 1 to 10.\r\n\r\n    4.

To each tube add 1 c.c. of erythrocyte solution.\r\n\r\n6. When necessary (that is to say in tubes 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 and 10) add\r\nnormal saline solution to the mixture in the test-tubes till the column\r\nof fluid in each reaches to the same level.\r\n\r\n7. Shake each tube in turn, so as to thoroughly mix its contents. Plug\r\nthe mouth of each tube with cotton wool, and place entire set in the\r\nincubator at 37 deg. C. for one hour.\r\n\r\n8. Remove the tubes from the incubator and into each tube pipette 0.1\r\nc.c. complement (guinea-pig's serum) and replace tubes in incubator at\r\n37 deg. C. for further period of one hour.\r\n\r\n9. Remove the tubes from the incubator, and if complete haemolysis has\r\nnot taken place in every tube, stand on one side, preferably in the ice\r\nchest, for an hour.\r\n\r\n10. Then examine the tubes.\r\n\r\n     Complete haemolysis is indicated by a clear red solution,\r\n     with no deposit of red cells at the bottom of the test-tube.\r\n\r\n     Absence of haemolysis is indicated by a clear or turbid\r\n     colourless fluid, with a deposit of red cells at the bottom\r\n     of the test-tubes.\r\n\r\nThe smallest amount of haemolytic serum that has caused complete\r\nhaemolysis is known as the minimal haemolytic dose (_M. H. D._) and if\r\nhaemolysis has occurred in all the tubes down to No. 7--the m. h. d. of\r\nthis particular serum is .005 c.c. = 200 minimal haemolytic doses per\r\ncubic centimetre. Such a serum is strong enough for experimental work;\r\nindeed, for many purposes, complete haemolysis down to tube 6 will\r\nindicate a serum sufficiently strong(= 100 m. h. d. per cubic\r\ncentimetre). If, however, only the first one or two tubes are completely\r\nhaemolysed, this is an indication that the rabbit should receive further\r\ninjections in order to raise the haemolytic power to a sufficiently high\r\nlevel.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTORAGE OF HAEMOLYSIN.\r\n\r\nIf, and when the haemolysin content of the rabbit's serum is found to be\r\nsufficient, destroy the animal by chloroform vapour.\r\n\r\nRemove as much of its blood as possible from the heart under aseptic\r\nprecautions into sterilized centrifuge tubes.\r\n\r\nTransfer the tubes of blood to the incubator at 37 deg. C. for two\r\nhours--then centrifugalize thoroughly.\r\n\r\nPipette off the clear serum, and fill in quantities of 1 c.c., into\r\nsmall glass ampoules or pipettes, and hermetically seal in the blowpipe\r\nflame, care being taken to avoid scorching the serum.\r\n\r\nPlace the ampoules when filled with serum and sealed, in a water-bath at\r\n56 deg. C. for 30 minutes. This destroys the complement, i. e.,\r\ninactivates the serum, and at the same time, provided the various\r\noperations have been carried out under aseptic precautions, ensures its\r\nsterility. A longer exposure reduces the haemolytic power.\r\n\r\nPlace the ampoules in a closed metal box and store in the ice chest for\r\nfuture use.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[10] The quantities here given are not absolutely correct. If exactitude\r\nis essential the student must calculate the amount required by the aid\r\nof the Percentage Formula, Appendix, page 496.\r\n\r\n[11] See Percentage Formula, Appendix, page 496.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII. EXPERIMENTAL INOCULATION OF ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe use of living animals for inoculation experiments may become a\r\nnecessary procedure in the Bacteriological Laboratory for some one or\r\nmore of the following reasons:\r\n\r\nA. ~Determination of Pathogenetic Properties of Bacteria already Isolated\r\nin Pure Culture~ (see page 315).\r\n\r\nThe exact study of the conditions influencing the virulence (including\r\nits maintenance, exaltation and attenuation) of an organism, and precise\r\nobservations upon the pathogenic effects produced by its entrance into,\r\nand multiplication within the body tissues can obviously only be carried\r\nout by means of experimental inoculation; whilst many points relating to\r\nvitality, longevity, etc., can be most readily elucidated by such\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\nB. ~Isolation of Pathogenetic Bacteria.~\r\n\r\nCertain highly parasitic bacteria (which grow with difficulty upon the\r\nartificial media of the laboratory) can only be isolated with\r\nconsiderable difficulty from associated saprophytic bacteria when\r\ncultural methods alone are employed; but if the mixture of parasite and\r\nsaprophytes is injected into an animal susceptible to the action of the\r\nformer, the pathogenic organism can readily be isolated from the tissues\r\nof the infected animal. The pneumococcus for example occurs in the\r\nsputum of patients suffering from acute lobar pneumonia, but usually in\r\nassociation with various saprophytes derived from the mouth and pharynx.\r\nThe optimum medium for the growth of the pneumococcus, blood agar, is\r\nalso an excellent pabulum for the saprophytes of the mouth, and plate\r\ncultures are rapidly overgrown by them to the destruction of the more\r\ndelicate pneumococcus. But inoculate some of the sputum under the skin\r\nof a mouse and three or four days later the pneumococcus will have\r\nentered the blood stream (leaving the saprophytes at the seat of\r\ninoculation) and killed the animal. Cultivations made at the post-mortem\r\n(see page 398) from the mouse's heart blood will yield a pure growth of\r\nthe pneumococcus.\r\n\r\nC. ~Identification of Pathogenetic Bacteria.~\r\n\r\nThe resemblances, morphological and cultural, existing between certain\r\npathogenetic bacteria are in some cases so great as to completely\r\noverwhelm the differences; again the same bacterium may under varying\r\nconditions assume appearances so different from those regarded as\r\ntypical or normal as to throw doubt on its identity. In each case a\r\nsimple inoculation experiment may decide the point at once. As a\r\nconcrete example may be instanced an autopsy on an animal dead from an\r\nunknown infection. Cultivations from the heart blood gave a pure growth\r\nof a typical (capsulated) pneumococcus. Cultivations from the liver gave\r\na pure growth of what appeared to be a typical (non-capsulated)\r\nStreptococcus pyogenes longus. The latter inoculated into a rabbit\r\ncaused the death of the animal from pneumococcic septicaemia, and\r\ncultures from the rabbit's blood gave a pure growth of a typical\r\n(capsulated) pneumococcus.\r\n\r\n~D. Study of the Problems of Immunity.~\r\n\r\nIt is only by a careful and elaborate study of the behaviour of the\r\nanimal cell and the body fluids vis-a-vis with the infecting bacterium\r\nthat it becomes possible to throw light upon the complex problem whereby\r\nthe cell opposes successful resistance to the diffusion of the invading\r\nmicrobe, or succeeds in driving out the microbe subsequently to the\r\noccurrence of that diffusion.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, however, our attention is directed to the first of these\r\nbroad headings, for it is by the application of the knowledge acquired\r\nin its pursuit that we are able to deal with problems arising under any\r\nof the remainder.\r\n\r\nFor whatever purpose the inoculation is performed, it is essential that\r\nthe experiment should be planned to secure the maximum amount of\r\ninformation and the minimum of discomfort to the animal used. Every care\r\ntherefore must be taken to ensure that the virus is introduced into the\r\nexact tissue or organ selected; and the operation itself must be carried\r\nout with skill and expedition, and under strictly aseptic conditions.\r\n\r\nIn the course of inoculation studies many instances of natural immunity,\r\nboth racial and individual, will be met with; but it must be recollected\r\nthat natural immunity is relative only and never absolute, and care be\r\ntaken not to label an organism as _non-pathogenic_ until many different\r\nmethods of inoculation have been performed upon different species of\r\nanimals, combined when necessary with various procedures calculated to\r\novercome any apparent immunity, and have invariably given negative\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nIn some countries experiments upon animals are only permitted under\r\ndirect license from the Government, and then only within premises\r\nspecially licensed for the purpose. In England this license is in the\r\ngrant of the Home Secretary, and confers the permission to experiment\r\nupon animals under general anaesthesia, provided that after the\r\nexperiment is completed the animal must be destroyed before regaining\r\nconsciousness. If it is intended to carry out simple hypodermic\r\ninoculations and superficial venesections, Certificate A, granting this\r\nspecific permission and dispensing with the necessity for general\r\nanaesthesia must be obtained _in addition to the license_; whilst if the\r\ninoculation entails more extensive operative procedures, and it is\r\nnecessary to observe the subsequent course of the infection, should such\r\noccur, the license must be _coupled with Certificate B_--since this\r\ncertificate removes the compulsion to destroy the animal whilst under\r\nthe anaesthetic. Further special certificates and combinations of\r\ncertificates are required if cats, dogs, horses, asses or cattle are to\r\nbe the subjects of experiment. Under every certificate it is expressly\r\nstipulated that if the animal shows signs of pain it must be destroyed\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nThe animals generally employed in the study of the pathogenic properties\r\nof the various micro-organisms are:\r\n\r\n    _Cold Blooded._       _Warm Blooded._         _Hot Blooded._\r\n        Frog.                 Mouse.                  Fowl.\r\n        Toad.                 Rat.                    Pigeon.\r\n        Lizard.               Guinea pig.\r\n                              Rabbit.\r\n                              Monkey.\r\n\r\n~Preparation.~--Before inoculation, the experimental animals should be\r\ncarefully examined, to avoid the risk of employing such as are already\r\ndiseased: since it must be remembered that in a state of nature, as well\r\nas in captivity, the animals employed for laboratory inoculations are\r\nsubject to infection by various animal and vegetable parasites, and in\r\nsome instances such infection presents no symptoms which are obvious to\r\nthe casual examination; the sex should be noted, the weight recorded,\r\nand the rectal temperature taken. The remaining items of importance are\r\nthe time of the inoculation, the material that is inoculated, and the\r\nmethod of inoculation, and finally under what authority the experiment\r\nis performed. In the author's laboratory these data are entered upon a\r\npink card which forms part of a card index system. The card further\r\nprovides space for notes on the course of the resulting infection, and\r\ncarries on the reverse the weight and temperature chart (Figs. 164 and\r\n165).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 164.--Front of inoculation card.]\r\n\r\n~Preliminary Inspection and Examination.~--The preliminary examination\r\nshould comprise observation of the animal at rest and in motion; the\r\nappearance of the fur, feathers or scales, inspection of the eyes, and\r\nof external orifices of the body; tactile examination of the body and\r\nlimbs, and palpation of the groins and abdomen; and in many cases the\r\nmicroscopical examination of fresh and stained blood-films.\r\n\r\nSome of the commoner forms of naturally acquired infection may be\r\nbriefly mentioned, without however touching upon the various fleas, lice\r\nand ticks which at times infect the ordinary laboratory animals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 165.--Back of inoculation card.]\r\n\r\n~The Rabbit~, particularly in captivity, is subject to attacks of Psoric\r\nAcari, and the infection is readily transmitted to rabbits in\r\nneighbouring cages and also to guinea pigs, but not to rats and mice.\r\nOne species (_Sarcoptes minor_ var. _cuniculi_) gives rise to the\r\nordinary mange. The infection first shows itself as thick yellowish\r\nscales and crusts around the nose, mouth and eyes, spreads to the bases\r\nand outer surfaces of the ears (never to the inside of the concha), to\r\nthe fore and hind legs and into the groins and around the genitals. The\r\nacari can be readily demonstrated microscopically in scrapings of the\r\nskin, treated with liquor potassae. Another form of scabies (due to\r\nPsoroptes _communis cuniculi_) commences at the bottom of the concha,\r\nwhich is filled with whitish-yellow masses consisting of dried crusts,\r\nscales, faeces, and dead acari. The base of the ear is hard and swollen,\r\nand lifting the animal by the ears--as is usually done--gives rise to\r\nconsiderable pain; indeed this symptom may be the one which first\r\nattracts attention to an infection, which causes progressive wasting and\r\nterminates in death. A mixed infection--sarcoptic plus psorotic\r\nacariasis--is sometimes seen.\r\n\r\nIf it is decided to try and save animals suffering from infection by\r\nthese parasites, they must be segregated, the scabs carefully cleaned\r\nfrom the infected areas and the denuded surfaces washed with 5 per cent.\r\nsolution of Potassium persulphate (a few drops being allowed to run into\r\nthe concha), or with a preparation containing equal parts of soft\r\nparaffin and vaseline with a few drops of lysol. This treatment should\r\nbe repeated daily until the acarus is destroyed and the animal has\r\nregained its normal condition. The cages should be disinfected and all\r\nneighbouring animals carefully examined, and any which show signs of\r\ninfection should be treated in a similar manner. Favus also attacks the\r\nrabbit, and the typical spots are first noted around the base of the\r\near.\r\n\r\nInfection by _Coccidium oviforme_ is very common, without however\r\npresenting any symptoms by which the infection may be recognised.\r\nUsually the condition is only noted post-mortem, when the liver is found\r\nto be studded with numerous cascating tubercles, which on examination\r\nprove to be cystic areas crowded with coccidia. Sometimes too the liver\r\nof a rabbit dead from some intentional or accidental bacterial infection\r\nis found at the post-mortem to be marked by fine yellowish streaks and\r\nsmall tubercles due to the embryos of _Taenia serrata_, while the cystic\r\nform (_Cysticercus pisiformis_) is often noted free in the peritoneal\r\ncavity, or invading the mesentery.\r\n\r\nAbscess formation from infection with ordinary pyogenic bacteria occurs\r\nnaturally in the rabbit, and frequently the animal house of a laboratory\r\nis decimated by an infective septicaemia due to _B. cuniculicida_.\r\n\r\nThe ~Mouse~ and ~Rat~ suffer from septicaemia, and from the cysticercus\r\nform of _Taenia murina_; the cystic form (_Cysticercus fasciolaris_) of\r\n_T. crassicollis_ has its habitat in their livers. These small rodents are\r\nfrequently infected with scabies, but if freely provided with clean\r\nstraw will clean themselves by rubbing through it. The mouse is also\r\nattacked by favus, and the rat is often infected with _Trypanosoma\r\nLewisi_.\r\n\r\nThe ~Guinea pig~, like the rabbit, suffers from scabies and coccidiosis.\r\nIn addition it is often naturally infected with _B. tuberculosis_, and\r\nit is a wise precaution to test animals as soon as they reach the\r\nlaboratory by injecting Koch's Old Tuberculin--0.5 c.c. causing death in\r\nthe tuberculous cavy within 48 hours.\r\n\r\nThe ~Monkey~ is naturally prone to tuberculosis, and should be injected\r\nwith 1 c.c. Old Tuberculin on arrival in the laboratory. The tissues of\r\nthe monkey also serve as the habitat for a Nematode worm parasitic in\r\ncattle (_Oesophagostoma inflatum_) resembling the Anchylostomum, and\r\nthis parasite frequently bores through the intestinal wall, and\r\nprovokes the formation of small cysts in the immediately adjacent\r\nmesentery. The presence of these cysts may give rise to considerable\r\nspeculation at the post-mortem.\r\n\r\nThe ~Pigeon~ may be infected by _Haemosporidia_, and its blood show the\r\npresence of halteridia. This bird may also be the subject of a bacterial\r\ninfection known as pigeon diphtheria; while the fowl may be subject to\r\nscabies and ringworm, or suffer from fowl cholera or fowl\r\nsepticaemia--infections due to members of the haemorrhagic septicaemia\r\ngroup.\r\n\r\n~Weighing.~--The larger animals are most conveniently weighed in a decimal\r\nscale provided with a metal cage for their reception instead of the\r\nordinary pan (Fig. 166). Mice and rats are weighed in a modification of\r\nthe letter balance, weighing to 250 grammes, which has a conical wire\r\ncage, (carefully counterpoised) substituted for its original pan (Fig.\r\n167).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 166.--Rabbit scales.]\r\n\r\n~Temperature.~--To take the rectal temperature of any of the laboratory\r\nanimals, the animal should be carefully and firmly held by an assistant.\r\nIntroduce the bulb of an ordinary clinical thermometer, well greased\r\nwith vaseline, just within the sphincter ani. Allow it to remain in this\r\nposition for a few seconds, and then push it on gently and steadily\r\nuntil the entire bulb and part of the stem, as far as the constriction,\r\nhave passed into the rectum. Three to five minutes later, the time\r\nvarying of course with the sensibility of the thermometer used, withdraw\r\nthe instrument and take the reading. The thermometers employed for\r\nrecording temperature should be verified from time to time by comparison\r\nwith a standard Kew certified Thermometer kept in the laboratory for\r\nthat purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 167.--Mouse scales]\r\n\r\n~Cages.~--During the period which elapses between inoculation and death,\r\nor complete recovery, the experimental animals must be kept in suitable\r\nreceptacles which can easily be kept clean and readily disinfected.\r\n\r\nThe _mouse_ is usually stored in a glass jar (Fig. 168) 11 cm. high and\r\n11 cm. in diameter, closed by a wire gauze cover which is weighted with\r\nlead or fastened to the mouth of the jar by a bayonet catch. A small\r\noblong label, 5 cm. by 2.5 cm., sand-blasted on the side of the\r\ncylinder, is a very convenient device as notes made upon this with an\r\nordinary lead pencil show up well and only require the use of a damp\r\ncloth to remove them (Fig. 168).\r\n\r\nThe _rat_ is kept under observation in a glass jar similar, but larger,\r\nto that used for the mouse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 168.--Mouse jar.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 169.--Tripod.]\r\n\r\nA layer of sawdust at the bottom of the jar absorbs any moisture and\r\ncotton-wool or paper shavings should be provided for bedding. The food\r\nshould consist of bran and oats with an occasional feed of\r\nbread-and-milk sop.\r\n\r\nThe use of a metal tripod, on the platform of which are soldered two\r\nsmall cups for the reception of the food, inside the cage, prevents\r\nwaste of food or its contamination with excreta (Fig. 169).\r\n\r\nAfter use the jars and tripods are sterilised either by chemical\r\nreagents or by autoclaving.\r\n\r\nThe _rabbit_ and the _guinea-pig_ are confined in cages of suitable\r\nsize, made entirely of metal (Fig. 170). The sides and top and bottom\r\nare of woven wire work; beneath the cage is a movable metal tray filled\r\nwith sawdust, for the reception of the excreta. The cage as a whole is\r\nraised from the ground on short legs. The sides, etc., are generally\r\nhinged so that the cage packs up flat, for convenience of storing and\r\nalso of sterilising.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary rat cage, a rectangular wire-work box, 30 cm. from front to\r\nback, 20 cm. wide, and 14 cm. high, makes an excellent cage for\r\nguinea-pigs if fitted with a shallow zinc tray, 35 cm. by 24 cm., for it\r\nto stand upon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 170.--Metal rabbit rage.]\r\n\r\nA plentiful supply of straw should be provided for bedding and the food\r\nshould consist of fresh vegetables, cabbage leaves, carrot and turnip\r\ntops and the like for the morning meal and broken animal biscuits for\r\nthe evening meal. Occasionally a little water may be placed in the cage\r\nin an earthenware dish.\r\n\r\nThe tray which receives the dejecta should be cleaned out and supplied\r\nwith fresh sawdust each day, and the soiled sawdust, remains of food,\r\netc., should be cremated.\r\n\r\nThese cages are sterilised after use either by autoclaving or spraying\r\nwith formalin.\r\n\r\nAs ~animal inoculation~ is purely a surgical operation, the necessary\r\ninstruments will be similar to those employed by the surgeon, and, like\r\nthem, must be sterile. In the performance of the inoculation strict\r\nattention must be paid to asepsis, and suitable precautions adopted to\r\nguard against accidental contamination of the material to be introduced\r\ninto the animal. In addition, the hands of the operator should be\r\ncarefully disinfected.\r\n\r\nThe list of apparatus used in animal inoculations given below comprises\r\npractically everything needed for any inoculation. Needless to remark,\r\nall the apparatus will never be required for any one inoculation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 171.--Hypodermic syringe with finger rests.]\r\n\r\n     Apparatus Required for Animal Inoculation:\r\n\r\n     1. Water steriliser (_vide_ page 33). It is also convenient\r\n     to have a second water steriliser, similar but smaller (23\r\n     by 7 by 5 cm.), for the sterilisation of the syringes.\r\n\r\n     2. Injection syringe. The best form is one of the ordinary\r\n     hypodermic pattern, 1 c.c. capacity graduated in twentieths\r\n     of a cubic centimeter (0.05 c.c.), fitted with finger rests,\r\n     but with the leather washers and the packing of the piston\r\n     replaced by those made of asbestos (Fig. 171). The\r\n     instrument must be easily taken to pieces, and spare parts\r\n     should be kept on hand to replace accidental breakage or\r\n     loss. Other useful syringes are those of 2 c.c., 5 c.c., 10\r\n     c.c., and 20 c.c. capacity. A good supply of needles must be\r\n     kept on hand, both sharp-pointed and with blunt ends. To\r\n     sterilise the syringe, fill it with water, loosen the\r\n     packing of the piston and all the screw joints, place it in\r\n     the steriliser and boil for at least five minutes. Disinfect\r\n     the syringe _after use_, in a similar manner. The needles,\r\n     which are exceedingly apt to rust after being boiled, should\r\n     be stored in a pot of absolute alcohol when not in use.\r\n\r\n     3. Operating table.\r\n\r\n     4. Surgical instruments. Sterilise these before use by\r\n     boiling, and disinfect them _after use_ by the same means.\r\n     Wipe perfectly dry immediately after the disinfection is\r\n     completed.\r\n\r\n     Scissors, probe and sharp-pointed.\r\n\r\n     Dissecting forceps of various patterns.\r\n\r\n     Pressure forceps.\r\n\r\n     Retractors (small self retaining Fig. 172).\r\n\r\n     Aneurism needles, sharp and blunt.\r\n\r\n     Scalpels, } Keratomes, } with metal handles. Trephines, }\r\n\r\n     Michel's steel clips and special forceps for applying the\r\n     same. These small steel clips enable the operator to easily\r\n     and rapidly close skin incisions and are most satisfactory\r\n     for animal operations.\r\n\r\n     Surgical needles.\r\n\r\n     Needle holder.\r\n\r\n     Soft rubber catheters, various sizes.\r\n\r\n     Gum elastic oesophageal bougies with connection to fit\r\n     syringe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 172. Small self retaining retractors.]\r\n\r\n5. Anaesthetic.\r\n\r\n(a) General: The safest general anaesthetic for animals is an A. C. E.\r\nmixture, freshly prepared, containing by volume alcohol 1 part,\r\nchloroform 2 parts, ether 6 parts, and should be administered on a\r\n\"cone\" formed by twisting up one corner of a towel and placing a wad of\r\ncotton-wool inside it, or from a saturated cotton-wool pad packed into\r\nthe bottom of a small beaker.\r\n\r\n(b) Local:\r\n\r\n    1. Cocaine hydrochloride, 2 per cent. in adrenalin 1 per mille\r\n       solution.\r\n    2. Beta-eucaine, 2 per cent. in adrenalin, 1 per mille solution.\r\n    3. Ethyl chloride jet.\r\n\r\n6. Sterile glass capsules of various sizes.\r\n\r\n7. Cases of sterile pipettes { 10 c.c. (in tenths of a cubic centimetre).\r\n                             {  1 c.c. (in hundredths of a cubic\r\n                                        centimetre).\r\n\r\n8. Flasks (75 c.c.) containing sterilised normal saline solution (or\r\nsterile bouillon).\r\n\r\n9. Sterilised cotton-wool. Cotton-wool (absorbent) is packed loosely in\r\na copper cylinder similar to that used for storing capsules, and\r\nsterilised in the hot-air oven.\r\n\r\n10. Sterilised gauze. Gauze is sterilised in the same way as\r\ncotton-wool.\r\n\r\n11. Sterilised silk and catgut for sutures. These are sterilised, as\r\nrequired, by boiling for some ten minutes in the water steriliser.\r\n\r\n12. Flexible collodion (or compound tincture of benzoin).\r\n\r\n13. Grease pencil.\r\n\r\n14. Tie-on celluloid labels, to affix to the cages.\r\n\r\n15. Razor.\r\n\r\n16. Small pot of warm water.\r\n\r\n17. Liquid soap. Liquid soap is prepared as follows: Measure out 100\r\ngrammes of soft soap and add to 500 c.c. of 2 per cent. lysol solution\r\nin a large glass beaker; dissolve by heating in a water-bath at about\r\n90 deg. C. Bottle and label \"Liquid Soap.\"\r\n\r\n18. In place of the liquid soap and razor it is sometimes convenient to\r\nuse a Depilatory powder.\r\n\r\n    Barium sulphide     1 part\r\n    Rice starch         3 parts\r\n\r\nDust the powder thickly over the area to be denuded of hair, sprinkle\r\nwith water and mix into a thin paste _in situ_; allow the paste to act\r\nfor three minutes, then scrape off with a bone spatula--the hair comes\r\naway with the paste and leaves a perfectly bare patch. This process is\r\npreferably carried out, the day previous to the operation.\r\n\r\n~Material Utilised for Inoculation.~--The material inoculated may be\r\neither--\r\n\r\n1. Cultures of bacteria--grown in fluid media, or on solid media.\r\n\r\n2. Metabolic products of bacterial activity--e. g., toxins in\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\n3. Pathological products (fluid secretions and excretions, solid\r\ntissues).\r\n\r\n~The Preparation of the Inoculum.~--\r\n\r\n(a) _Cultivations in Fluid Media._--\r\n\r\n1. Flame the plug of the culture tube.\r\n\r\n2. Remove the plug and flame the mouth of the tube.\r\n\r\n3. Slightly raise the lid of a sterile capsule, insert the mouth of the\r\nculture tube into the aperture and pour some of the cultivation into the\r\ncapsule.\r\n\r\n4. Remove the mouth of the culture tube from the capsule, replace the\r\nlid of the latter, flame the mouth of the tube, and replug.\r\n\r\n5. Remove the syringe from the steriliser, squirt out the water from its\r\ninterior, and allow to cool.\r\n\r\n6. Raise the lid of the capsule sufficiently to admit the needle of the\r\nsyringe and draw the required amount of the cultivation into the barrel\r\nof the syringe.\r\n\r\n(Or, remove a definite measured quantity of the cultivation directly\r\nfrom the tube or flask by means of a sterile graduated pipette,\r\ndischarge the measured amount into a sterile capsule, and fill into the\r\nsyringe; or take up the required quantity of the cultivation directly\r\ninto the graduated syringe from the tube or flask.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 173.--Conical separatory funnel, fitted for\r\ninjection of fluid cultivations.]\r\n\r\nIf it is necessary to introduce a large bulk of fluid into the animal,\r\nthe cultivation should be transferred with aseptic precautions, to a\r\nsterile separatory funnel, preferably of the shape shown in figure 173,\r\nand graduated if necessary. This is supported on a retort stand and\r\nraised sufficiently above the level of the animal to be injected, so as\r\nto secure a good \"fall.\" A piece of sterilised rubber tubing of suitable\r\nlength, fitted with an injection needle and provided with a screw clamp,\r\nis now attached to the nozzle of the funnel and the operation completed\r\naccording to the requirements of the particular case.\r\n\r\nThis method is quite satisfactory when the injection is made into the\r\npleural or abdominal cavities or directly into a vein but if the\r\ninjection has to be made into the subcutaneous tissue the \"fall\" may not\r\nbe sufficient to force the fluid in. In this case it will be necessary\r\nto transfer the culture to a sterile wash-bottle and fasten a rubber\r\nhand bellows to the air inlet tube (interposing an air filter) and\r\nattach the tubing with the injection needle to the outlet tube (Fig.\r\n174). By careful use sufficient force can be obtained to drive the\r\ninjection in.\r\n\r\n(b) _Cultivations on Solid Media (e. g., Sloped Agar)._--\r\n\r\n1. By means of a sterile graduated pipette introduce a suitable small\r\nquantity of sterile bouillon (or sterile normal saline solution) into\r\nthe culture tube.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 174.--Arrangement of pressure injection apparatus.]\r\n\r\n2. With a sterile platinum loop or spatula scrape the bacterial growth\r\noff the surface of the medium, and emulsify it with the bouillon. It\r\nthen becomes to all intents and purposes a fluid inoculum.\r\n\r\n3. Pour the emulsion into a sterile capsule and fill the syringe\r\ntherefrom.\r\n\r\n(c) _Toxins._--Prepared by previously described methods (_vide_ page\r\n318), are manipulated in a similar manner to cultivations in fluid\r\nmedia.\r\n\r\n(d) _Pathological Products._--Fluid secretions, excretions, etc., such\r\nas serous exudation, pus, blood, etc., are treated as fluid\r\ncultivations; but if the material is very thick or viscous, a small\r\nquantity of sterile bouillon or normal saline solution may be used to\r\ndilute it, and thorough incorporation effected by the help of a sterile\r\nplatinum rod.\r\n\r\nSolid tissues, such as spleen, lymph glands, etc., may be divided into\r\nsmall pieces by sterile instruments and rubbed up in a sterilised agate\r\nmortar (using an agate pestle), with a small quantity of sterile\r\nbouillon, and the syringe filled from the resulting emulsion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 175.--Holding rabbit for shaving.]\r\n\r\nIf it is desired to inoculate tissue _en masse_, remove from the\r\nmaterial a small cube of 1 or 2 mm. and introduce it into a wound made\r\nby sterile instruments in a suitable situation, and occlude the wound by\r\nmeans of Michel's steel clips and a sealed dressing.\r\n\r\n~Method of Securing Animals During Inoculation.~--\r\n\r\nFor the majority of inoculations, especially when no anaesthetic is\r\nadministered, it is customary to employ an assistant to hold the animal\r\n(see Fig. 175).\r\n\r\nIf working single handed Voge's holder for guinea-pigs, is a useful\r\npiece of apparatus the method of using which is readily seen from the\r\naccompanying figures (Figs. 176, 177).\r\n\r\nThe instrument itself consists of a hollow copper cylinder, one end of\r\nwhich is turned over a ring of stout copper wire, and from this open end\r\na slot is cut extending about half way along one side of the cylinder.\r\nThe opposite end is closed by a \"pull-off\" cap and is perforated around\r\nits edge by a row of ventilating holes, which correspond with holes cut\r\nin the rim of the cap. In the event of the animal resisting attempts to\r\nremove it from the holder backwards, this cap is taken off and the\r\nholder placed on the table and the guinea-pig allowed to walk out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 176.--Taking guinea-pig's temperature.]\r\n\r\nTo provide for different-sized animals, two sizes of this holder will be\r\nfound useful:\r\n\r\n1. Length, 16 cm.; breadth, 6 cm.; size of slot, 8 cm. by 2.5 cm.\r\n\r\n2. Length, 20 cm.; breadth, 8 cm.; size of slot, 10 cm. by 2.5 cm.\r\n\r\nA convenient holder for mice and even small rats is shown in figure 178,\r\nthe tail being securely held by the spring clip. Needless to say, the\r\nholder should be entirely of metal, and the wire cage detachable and\r\neasily renewed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 177.--Voge's holder.]\r\n\r\nWhen the animal is anaesthetised, it is more convenient to secure it\r\nfirmly to some simple form of operating table, such as Tatin's (Fig.\r\n179), which will accommodate rabbits, guinea-pigs, and rats: or to the\r\nmore elaborate table devised by the author (Fig. 180).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 178.--Mouse holder.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 179.--Tatin's operation table.]\r\n\r\n~Operation Table.~--This is a table of the \"aseptic\" type, composed of\r\nsteel tubing, nickel-plated or enamelled. The table-top frame is\r\nsufficiently large to accommodate rabbits, dogs and monkeys; and is\r\nsupported upon telescopic uprights, so that it is adjustable as to\r\nheight; in its long axis it can be inclined (at either end) to 45 deg.\r\nfrom the horizontal. Further it can be completely rotated about its long\r\naxis. The table-top itself is composed of a sheet of copper wire gauze\r\nloosely suspended from the long sides of the tubular frame. The\r\nslackness of the gauze bed permits of an india rubber hot water bottle,\r\nor an electrotherm being placed under the animal, and if during the\r\ncourse of an experiment it is necessary to reverse the animal, the\r\ntable-top frame is completely rotated, the device adopted for suspending\r\nthe gauze is detached and the gauze reversed also, so that it again\r\nsupports the animal from below.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 180.--Author's operating table[12].]\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF INOCULATION.\r\n\r\nThe following methods of inoculation apply more particularly to the\r\nrabbit, but from them it will readily be seen what modifications in\r\ntechnique, if any, are necessary in the case of the other experimental\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n~1. Cutaneous Inoculation.~--(_Anaesthetic, none._)\r\n\r\n1. Have the animal firmly held by an assistant (or secured to the\r\noperating table).\r\n\r\n2. Apply the liquid soap to the fur, over the area selected for\r\ninoculation, with a wad of cotton-wool, and lather freely by the aid of\r\nwarm water; shave carefully and thoroughly; or apply the depilatory\r\npowder.\r\n\r\n3. Wash the denuded area of skin thoroughly with 2 per cent. lysol\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\n4. Wash off the lysol with ether and allow the latter to evaporate.\r\n\r\n5. Make numerous short, parallel, superficial incisions with the point\r\nof a sterile scalpel.\r\n\r\n6. When the oozing from the incisions has ceased, rub the inoculum into\r\nthe scarifications by means of the flat of a scalpel blade, or a sterile\r\nplatinum spatula.\r\n\r\n7. Cover the inoculated area with a pad of sterile gauze secured _in\r\nsitu_ by strips of adhesive plaster or by sealing down the edges of the\r\ngauze with collodion.\r\n\r\n8. Release the animal, place it in its cage, and affix a label upon\r\nwhich is written:\r\n\r\n    (a) Distinctive name or number of the animal.\r\n    (b) Its weight.\r\n    (c) Particulars as to source and dose of inoculum.\r\n    (d) Date of inoculation.\r\n\r\n~2. Subcutaneous Inoculation.~--\r\n\r\n(a) _Fluid Inoculum._--(_Anaesthetic, none._)\r\n\r\nSteps 1-4. As for cutaneous inoculation.\r\n\r\n5. Pinch up a fold of skin between the forefinger and thumb of the left\r\nhand; take the charged hypodermic syringe in the right hand, enter the\r\nneedle into a ridge of skin raised by the left finger and thumb, and\r\npush it steadily onward until about 2 cm. of the needle are lying in the\r\nsubcutaneous tissue. Now release the grasp of the left hand and slowly\r\ninject the fluid contained in the syringe.\r\n\r\n6. Withdraw the needle, and at the same moment close the puncture with a\r\nwad of cotton wool, to prevent the escape of any of the inoculum. The\r\ninjected fluid, unless large in amount, will be absorbed within a very\r\nshort time.\r\n\r\n7. Label, etc.\r\n\r\n(b) _Solid Inoculum.--(Anaesthetic, none; or Ethyl chloride spray.)_\r\n\r\nSteps 1-4. As for cutaneous inoculation.\r\n\r\n5. Raise a small fold of skin in a pair of forceps, and make a small\r\nincision through the skin with a pair of sharp-pointed scissors or with\r\nthe point of a scalpel.\r\n\r\n6. Insert a probe through the opening and push it steadily onward in the\r\nsubcutaneous tissue, and by lateral movements separate the skin from the\r\nunderlying muscles to form a funnel-shaped pocket with its apex toward\r\nthe point of entrance.\r\n\r\n7. By means of a pair of fine-pointed forceps introduce a small piece of\r\nthe inoculum into this pocket and deposit it as far as possible from the\r\npoint of entrance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 181.--Glass tube syringe for subcutaneous \"solid\"\r\ninoculation.]\r\n\r\nOr, improvise a syringe by sliding a piece of glass rod (to serve as a\r\npiston) into the lumen of a slightly shorter length of glass tubing and\r\nsecure in position by a band of rubber tubing. Sterilise by boiling.\r\nWithdraw the rod a few millimetres and deposit the piece of tissue\r\nwithin the orifice of the tube, by means of sterile forceps. Now pass\r\nthe tube into the depths of the \"pocket,\" push on the glass rod till it\r\nprojects beyond the end of the tube, and withdraw the apparatus, leaving\r\nthe tissue behind in the wound.\r\n\r\n8. Close the wound in the skin with Michel's clips and a dressing of\r\ngauze sealed with collodion (or Tinct. benzoin).\r\n\r\n9. Label, etc.\r\n\r\n~3. Intramuscular.~--\r\n\r\n(a) _Fluid Inoculum.--(Anaesthetic, none.)_\r\n\r\nSteps 1-4. As for cutaneous inoculation.\r\n\r\n5. Steady the skin over the selected muscle or muscles with the slightly\r\nseparated left forefinger and thumb.\r\n\r\n6. Thrust the needle of the injecting syringe boldly into the muscular\r\ntissue and inject the inoculum slowly.\r\n\r\n7. Label, etc.\r\n\r\n(b) _Solid Inoculum.--(Anaesthetic, A. C. E.)_\r\n\r\n1. Secure the animal to the operation table and anaesthetise.\r\n\r\n2. Shave and disinfect the skin at the seat of operation.\r\n\r\n3. Surround the field of operation by strips of gauze wrung out in 2 per\r\ncent. lysol solution.\r\n\r\n4. Incise skin, aponeurosis, and muscle in turn.\r\n\r\n5. Deposit the inoculum in the depths of the incision.\r\n\r\n6. Close the wound in the muscle with buried sutures and the cutaneous\r\nwound with either continuous or interrupted sutures or with Michel's\r\nsteel clips.\r\n\r\n7. Apply a sealed dressing of gauze and collodion.\r\n\r\n8. Remove the animal from the operating table.\r\n\r\n9. Label, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n~4. Intraperitoneal.~--\r\n\r\n(a) _Fluid Inoculum.--(Anaesthetic, none.)_\r\n\r\nSteps 1-4. As for cutaneous inoculation. Shave a fairly broad transverse\r\narea, stretching from flank to flank.\r\n\r\n5. Place the left forefinger on one flank and the thumb on the opposite,\r\nand pinch up the entire thickness of the abdominal parietes in a\r\ntriangular fold. Now, by slipping the peritoneal surfaces (which are in\r\napposition) one over the other, ascertain that no coils of intestine are\r\nincluded in the fold.\r\n\r\n6. Take the syringe in the right hand and with the needle transfix the\r\nfold near its base (Fig. 182).\r\n\r\n7. Now release the fold, but hold the syringe steady; as the parietes\r\nflatten out, the point of the needle is left free in the peritoneal\r\ncavity (see Fig. 183).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 182.--Intraperitoneal inoculation--fluid.]\r\n\r\n8. Inject the fluid from the syringe.\r\n\r\n9. Label, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 183.--Section of abdominal wall, etc., showing point\r\nof needle lying free in the peritoneal cavity above the coils of\r\nintestine.]\r\n\r\nSecond Method:\r\n\r\nSteps 1-4. As in the first method.\r\n\r\n5. Anaesthetise a small selected area of skin by spraying it with ethyl\r\nchloride.\r\n\r\n6. Heat platinum searing wire (0.5 mm. wire, twisted to the shape\r\nindicated in figure 184, mounted in an aluminium handle) to redness, and\r\nwith it burn a hole through the anaesthetic area of skin and abdominal\r\nmuscle down to, but not through, the visceral peritoneum.\r\n\r\n7. Fix a blunt-ended needle on to the charged syringe, and by pressing\r\nthe rounded end firmly against the peritoneum it can easily be pushed\r\nthrough into the peritoneal cavity.\r\n\r\n8. Inject the fluid from the syringe.\r\n\r\n9. Label, etc.\r\n\r\nThis method is especially useful when it is desired to collect samples\r\nof the peritoneal fluid from time to time during the period of\r\nobservation, as fluid can be removed from the peritoneal cavity, at\r\nintervals, through this aperture in the abdominal parietes, by means of\r\na sterile capillary pipette.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 184.--Platinum wire for burning hole through\r\nparietes.]\r\n\r\n(b) _Solid Inoculum_ (or the implantation of capsules containing fluid\r\ncultivations).--(_Anaesthetic, A. C. E._)\r\n\r\n1. Anaesthetise the animal and secure it to the operating table.\r\n\r\n2. Shave a large area of the abdominal parietes.\r\n\r\n3. Make an incision through the skin in the middle line about 2 cm. in\r\nlength, midway between the lower end of the sternum and the pubes.\r\n\r\n4. Divide the aponeuroses between the recti upon a director.\r\n\r\n5. Divide the peritoneum upon a director.\r\n\r\n6. Introduce the inoculum into the peritoneal cavity.\r\n\r\n7. Close the peritoneal cavity with Lembert's sutures.\r\n\r\n8. Close the skin and aponeurosis incisions together with interrupted\r\nsutures or Michel's steel clips, and apply a sealed dressing.\r\n\r\n9. Release the animal from the operating table.\r\n\r\n10. Label, etc.\r\n\r\nSuitable sacs may be readily prepared by either of the following\r\nmethods:\r\n\r\nA. ~Collodion Sacs.~\r\n\r\n1. Dip a small test-tube (5 by 0.5 cm.), bottom downward, into a beaker\r\nof collodion, and dry in the air; repeat this process three or four\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n2. Dip the tube, with its coating of collodion, alternately into a\r\nbeaker of alcohol and one of water. This loosens the collodion and\r\nallows it to be peeled off in the shape of a small test-tube.\r\n\r\n3. Take a 20 cm. length of glass tubing, of about the diameter of the\r\ntest-tube used in forming the sac, and insert one end into the open\r\nmouth of the sac.\r\n\r\n4. Suspend the glass tube with attached sac, inside a larger test-tube,\r\nby packing cotton-wool in the mouth of the test-tube around the glass\r\ntubing, and place in the incubator at 37 deg. C. for twenty-four hours.\r\nWhen removed from the incubator, the sac will be firmly adherent to the\r\nextremity of the glass tubing.\r\n\r\n5. Plug the open end of the glass tubing with cotton-wool, and sterilise\r\nthe test-tube and its contents in the hot-air oven.\r\n\r\nTo use the sac, remove the plug from the glass tubing, partly fill the\r\nsac with cultivation to be inoculated, by means of a sterile capillary\r\npipette, and replug the tubing. When the abdominal cavity has been\r\nopened, remove the tubing and attached sac from the protecting\r\ntest-tube, close the sac by tying a sterilised silk thread tightly\r\naround it a little below the end of the glass tubing, and separate it\r\nfrom the tubing by cutting through the collodion above the ligature, and\r\nthe sac is ready for insertion in the peritoneal cavity.\r\n\r\nB. ~Celloidin Sacs~ (_Harris_).\r\n\r\n_Materials Required._\r\n\r\n     Quill glass tubing.\r\n\r\n     Gelatine capsules such as pharmacists prepare for the\r\n     exhibition of bulky powders.\r\n\r\n     Various grades of celloidin, thick and thin, in wide-mouthed\r\n     bottles.\r\n\r\n1. Take a piece of quill glass tubing some 4 cm. long by 5 mm. diameter;\r\nheat one end in the bunsen flame.\r\n\r\n2. Thrust the heated end of the tube just through one end of a gelatine\r\ncapsule and allow it to cool (Fig. 185).\r\n\r\n3. Remove any gelatine from the lumen of the tube with a heated platinum\r\nneedle; paint the joint between capsule and tube with moderately thick\r\ncelloidin and allow to dry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 185.--Making celloidin capsules.]\r\n\r\n4. Dip the capsule into a beaker containing thin celloidin, beyond the\r\njunction with the glass and after removal rotate it in front of the\r\nblowpipe air blast to dry it evenly. Repeat these manoeuvres until a\r\nsufficiently thick coating is obtained.\r\n\r\n5. Apply thick celloidin to the tube-capsule joint, the opposite end of\r\nthe capsule, and the line of junction of the capsule with its cap; dry\r\nthoroughly.\r\n\r\n6. With a teat pipette fill the capsule (through the attached tube) with\r\nhot water, and stand the capsule in a beaker of boiling water for a few\r\nminutes to melt the gelatine.\r\n\r\n7. Remove the solution of gelatine from the interior of the celloidin\r\ncase with a pipette.\r\n\r\n8. Fill the sac with nutrient broth and place it, _glass tube downward_,\r\nin a tube containing sufficient sterile nutrient broth to cover the sac\r\nto the depth of 1 cm. Plug the tube and sterilise in the steamer in the\r\nusual manner.\r\n\r\n9. To prepare the sac for use, empty it out of the broth tube into a\r\nsterile glass dish.\r\n\r\n10. Grasp the tube near its junction with the sac in the jaws of sterile\r\nforceps, and with a teat pipette remove sufficient of the contained\r\nbroth to leave a small space in the sac. Introduce the inoculum in the\r\nform of an emulsion by means of another pipette.\r\n\r\n11. Still holding the tube in the forceps, draw it out and seal off near\r\nthe sac in the blowpipe flame.\r\n\r\n12. When cool wash the sac in sterile water, then transfer to a tube of\r\nnutrient broth and incubate over night to determine its impermeability\r\nto bacteria.\r\n\r\n13. If the broth outside the sac remains sterile, insert the sac in the\r\nperitoneal cavity of the experimental animal.\r\n\r\n~5. Intracranial.~--(_Anaesthetic, A. C. E._)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 186.--Guarded trephine.]\r\n\r\n_Trephines and Surgical Engine._--The most useful instrument for\r\nintracranial operations upon animals is the small nasal trephine\r\n(Curtis) having a tooth cutting circle of 7 mm. The addition of an\r\nadjustable collar guard--secured by a screw--prevents accidental\r\nlaceration of the dura mater or brain substance[13] (Fig. 186). This\r\nsize is suitable for monkeys, dogs, cats and large rabbits. Other\r\nsmaller sizes which will be found useful for guinea pigs and other small\r\nanimals cut circles of 6 and 4 mm.; for very small animals--young guinea\r\npigs and rats--a small dental drill or screw will make a sufficiently\r\nlarge hole to admit the syringe needle. The trephine can be set in\r\nordinary metal handles and rotated by hand, but a surgical engine of\r\nsome kind is much preferable on the score of rapidity and safety to the\r\nanimal. The Guy's electrical Dental engine[14] (Fig. 187) which can be\r\nconnected to a lamp socket or wall plug, and is operated by a foot\r\nswitch, although inexpensive is eminently satisfactory.\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--A fine dental drill attached to the dental engine\r\n     renders the manufacture of aluminium handles needles (see\r\n     page 71) quite an easy matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(a) _Subdural._\r\n\r\n1. Anaesthetise the animal and secure it to the operating table, dorsum\r\nuppermost.\r\n\r\n2. Shave a portion of the scalp immediately in front of the ears.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 187.--Guy's electrical dental engine.]\r\n\r\n3. Mark out with a sharp scalpel a crescentic flap of skin muscle, etc.,\r\nconvexity forward, commencing 0.5 cm. in front of the root of one ear\r\nand terminating at a similar spot in front of the other ear. Reflect the\r\nmarked flap.\r\n\r\n4. Make a corresponding incision through the periosteum and raise it\r\nwith a blunt dissector.\r\n\r\n5. With a small trephine (diameter 6 mm.) remove a circular piece of\r\nbone from the parietal segment. The centre of the trephine hole should\r\nbe at the intersection of the median line and a line joining the\r\nposterior canthi (Fig. 188).\r\n\r\n6. Introduce the inoculum by means of a hypodermic syringe, perforating\r\nthe dura mater with the needle and depositing the material immediately\r\nbelow this membrane, at the same time taking care to avoid injuring the\r\nsinuses.\r\n\r\n7. Turn back the flap of skin and secure it in position with Michel's\r\nsteel clips.\r\n\r\n8. Dress with sterile gauze and wool and seal the dressing with\r\ncollodion.\r\n\r\n9. Label, etc.\r\n\r\n(b) _Intracerebral._--This inoculation is performed precisely as for\r\nsubdural save in step 6 the needle after perforating the dura mater is\r\npushed onward into the substance of one or other cerebral hemispheres\r\nbefore the contents are ejected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 188.--Intracranial inoculation of rabbit. The circle\r\nindicates the situation of the trephine hole.]\r\n\r\n~6. Intraocular.~--\r\n\r\n(a) _Fluid Inoculum._--(_Anaesthetic, cocaine._)\r\n\r\n1. Instil a few drops of a sterile solution of cocaine, and repeat the\r\ninstillation in two minutes.\r\n\r\n2. Five minutes later have the animal firmly held by an assistant as in\r\nintravenous injection (see Fig. 189), the head being steadied by the\r\nassistant's hands.\r\n\r\n3. Select two needles to accurately fit the same syringe and sterilise.\r\n\r\n4. Attach one needle to the syringe and take up the required dose of\r\ninoculum and remove the needle.\r\n\r\n5. Steady the eye with fixation forceps; then pierce the cornea with the\r\nother syringe needle and allow the aqueous to escape through the needle.\r\n\r\n6. Without removing the needle from the cornea attach the syringe and\r\nmake the injection into the anterior chamber.\r\n\r\n7. Irrigate the conjunctival sac with sterile saline solution.\r\n\r\n8. Label, etc.\r\n\r\n(b) _Solid Inoculum._--(_Anaesthetic, A. C. E._)\r\n\r\n1. Anaesthetise the animal and secure it firmly to the operating table.\r\n\r\n2. Irrigate the conjunctival sac thoroughly with sterile saline\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\n3. Make an incision through the upper quadrant of the cornea into the\r\nanterior chamber by means of a triangular keratome.\r\n\r\n4. Separate the lips of the corneal wound with a flexible silver\r\nspatula; seize the solid inoculum in a pair of iris forceps, introduce\r\nit through the corneal wound, and deposit it on the anterior surface of\r\nthe iris; withdraw the forceps.\r\n\r\n5. Again irrigate the sac and the surface of the cornea.\r\n\r\n6. Release the animal from the operating table.\r\n\r\n7. Label, etc.\r\n\r\n~7. Intrapulmonary.~--\r\n\r\n_Fluid Inoculum._--(_Anaesthetic, none._)\r\n\r\n1. Have the animal firmly held by an assistant. (In this case the\r\nforeleg of the selected side is drawn up by the assistant and held with\r\nthe ear of that side.)\r\n\r\n2. Shave carefully in the axillary line and disinfect the denuded skin.\r\n\r\n3. Thrust the needle of the syringe boldly through the fifth or sixth\r\nintercostal space into the lung tissue.\r\n\r\n4. Inject the contents of the syringe slowly.\r\n\r\n5. Label, etc.\r\n\r\n~8. Intravenous.~--\r\n\r\n_Fluid Inoculum._--(_Anaesthetic, none._)\r\n\r\nThe site selected for the injection in the rabbit is the posterior\r\nauricular vein (see Fig. 192). Although this is smaller than the median\r\nvein, it is firmly bound down to the cartilage of the ear by dense\r\nconnective tissue, and is therefore more readily accessible. (In the\r\nguinea-pig the jugular vein must be utilised, and in order to perform\r\nthe inoculation satisfactorily a general anaesthetic must be\r\nadministered to the animal. In the monkey or the dog, the internal\r\nsaphenous vein is the most convenient and before puncturing should be\r\ndistended or rendered prominent by compressing the vein above the\r\nselected site.)\r\n\r\n_Preparation of the Inoculum._--Care must be taken in preparing the\r\ninoculum, as the injection of even small fragments may cause fatal\r\nembolism. To obviate this risk the fluid should, if possible, be\r\nfiltered through sterile filter paper before filling into the syringe.\r\n\r\nAir bubbles, when injected into a vein, frequently cause immediate\r\ndeath. To prevent this, the syringe after being filled should be held in\r\nthe vertical position, needle uppermost. A piece of sterile filter paper\r\nis then impaled on the needle and the piston of the syringe pressed\r\nupward until all the air is expelled from the barrel and needle. Should\r\nany drops of the inoculum be forced out, they will fall on the filter\r\npaper, which should be immediately burned.\r\n\r\n1. Have the animal firmly held by an assistant. The selected ear is\r\ngrasped at its root and stretched forward toward the operator.\r\n\r\n2. Shave the posterior border of the dorsum of the ear.\r\n\r\n3. Disinfect the skin over the vein, rubbing it vigourously with\r\ncotton-wool soaked in lysol. The friction will make the vein more\r\nconspicuous. Wash the lysol off with ether and allow the latter to\r\nevaporate.\r\n\r\n4. Direct the assistant to compress the vein at the root of the ear.\r\nThis will cause its peripheral portion to swell up and increase in\r\ncalibre.\r\n\r\n5. Hold the syringe as one would a pen and thrust the point of the\r\nneedle through the skin and the wall of the vein till it enters the\r\nlumen of the vein (Fig. 189). Now press it onward in the direction of\r\nthe blood stream--i. e., toward the body of the animal.\r\n\r\n6. Direct the assistant to cease compressing the root of the ear, and\r\n_slowly_ inject the inoculum. (If the fluid is being forced into the\r\nsubcutaneous tissue, a condition which is at once indicated by the\r\nswelling that occurs, the injection must be stopped and another attempt\r\nmade at a spot closer to the root of the ear or at some point on the\r\ncorresponding vein on the opposite ear.)\r\n\r\n7. Withdraw the needle and press a pledget of cotton-wool over the\r\npuncture to ensure closure of the aperture in the vein wall.\r\n\r\n8. Label, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 189.--Intravenous inoculation.]\r\n\r\n~9. Inhalation.~--\r\n\r\n(a) _Fluid Inoculum._--(_Anaesthetic, none._)\r\n\r\n1. Place the animal in a closed metal box.\r\n\r\n2. Through a hole in one side introduce the nozzle of some simple\r\nspraying apparatus, such as is used for nasal medicaments.\r\n\r\n3. Fill the reservoir of the instrument (previously sterilised) with the\r\nfluid inoculum, and having attached the bellows, spray the inoculum into\r\nthe interior of the box.\r\n\r\n4. On the completion of the spraying, open the box, spray the animal\r\nthoroughly with a 10 per cent. solution of formaldehyde (to destroy any\r\nof the virus that may be adhering to fur or feathers).\r\n\r\n5. Transfer the animal to its cage.\r\n\r\n6. Label, etc.\r\n\r\n7. Thoroughly disinfect the inhalation chamber.\r\n\r\n(b) _Fluid or Powdered Inoculum._--_Anaesthetic, A. C. E._\r\n\r\n1. Anaesthetise the animal and secure it firmly to the operating table.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 190.--Gag for rabbits.]\r\n\r\n2. Prop open the mouth by means of some form of gag; seize the tongue\r\nwith a pair of forceps and draw it forward.\r\n\r\nThe most convenient form of gag for the rabbit or cat is that shown in\r\nFig. 190. It is simply a strip of hard wood shaped at the middle and\r\nprovided with a square orifice through which a tracheal or oesophageal\r\ntube can be passed.\r\n\r\n3. Pass a previously sterilised glass tube (17 cm. long, 0.5 cm.\r\ndiameter, with its terminal 2 cm. slightly curved) down through the\r\nlarynx into the trachea.\r\n\r\n4. Connect the straight portion of a ~Y~-shaped piece of tubing to the\r\nupper end of the sterilised tube and couple one branch of the ~Y~ to a\r\nseparatory funnel containing the fluid inoculum, or insufflator\r\ncontaining the powdered inoculum, and the other to a hand bellows.\r\n\r\n5. Allow the fluid inoculum to run into the lungs by gravity, or blow in\r\nthe powdered inoculum by means of a rubber-ball bellows.\r\n\r\n6. Remove the intratracheal tube; release the animal from the table.\r\n\r\n7. Label, etc.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative method in the case of fairly large animals, such as\r\nrabbits, etc., a sterile piece of glass tubing of suitable diameter may\r\nbe passed through the larynx down the trachea almost to its\r\nbifurcation. Fluid cultivations may then be literally poured into the\r\nlungs, or cultivations, dried and powdered, may be blown into the lung\r\nby the aid of a small hand bellows or even a teat pipette.\r\n\r\n~10. Intragastric Inoculation.~--_Fluid or semi-fluid inoculum.\r\n(Anaesthetic none.)_\r\n\r\nThe method of performing the operation is varied slightly according to\r\nthe size of the experimental animal.\r\n\r\n_A. Monkey, Rabbit, Guinea-pig._\r\n\r\n1. Secure the animal to the operating table ventral surface uppermost.\r\n\r\n2. Prop the mouth open with a gag; draw the tongue forward with forceps.\r\n\r\n3. Sterilise a soft rubber catheter (No. 10 or 8 English scale, or No.\r\n18 or 15 French) and lubricate it with sterile glycerine.\r\n\r\n4. Pass it to the back of the pharynx, keeping the end in the middle\r\nline.\r\n\r\n5. Gently assist the progress of the catheter down the oesophagus\r\nuntil it passes the cardiac orifice of the stomach. Do not use any\r\nforce.\r\n\r\n6. Take up the required dose of inoculum into a sterilised pipette.\r\nInsert the point of the pipette into the open end of the catheter and\r\nallow the fluid to run down into the stomach. Remove the pipette and\r\ndrop it into a jar of lysol.\r\n\r\n7. With another sterile pipette run one cubic centimetre of sterile\r\nsaline solution through the catheter to wash out the last traces of the\r\ninoculum.\r\n\r\n8. Withdraw the catheter.\r\n\r\n9. Label, etc.\r\n\r\n_B. Rats and Mice (Mark's Method)._\r\n\r\n1. Secure the animal in the vertical position.\r\n\r\n(a) _Rat._--Take a pair of catch sinus forceps about 22 cm. in length\r\nand seize the animal by the loose skin of the head as far forward as\r\npossible--fix the forceps, and holding the instrument vertically upward,\r\ntransfer to the left hand of an assistant who secures the animal's tail\r\nbetween the fingers grasping the handle of the forceps. (See Fig. 191.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 191.--Intragastric inoculation of rat.]\r\n\r\n(b) _Mouse._--An assistant grasps the loose skin between the ears as far\r\nforwards as possible between the forefinger and thumb of the left hand.\r\nHe now grasps the tail with the right hand, draws the mouse straight and\r\npasses the tail between the fourth and little fingers of the left hand\r\nand secures it there.\r\n\r\n2. The assistant takes a closed pair of thin-bladed forceps in his right\r\nhand, passes the ends into the animal's mouth, then allows the blades to\r\nseparate. This opens the animal's jaw and serves as a gag.\r\n\r\n3. Moisten the sterilised oesophageal tube with sterile water. (This\r\ntube is of silk rubber, 6.5 cm. in length, with the distal end rounded,\r\nthe proximal end mounted in a syringe needle head, which fits the\r\nnozzles of the two sterile syringes to be used.)\r\n\r\n4. Grasp the tube about its middle and pass it into the animal's mouth,\r\ndownwards and a little to one side or the other until its length is lost\r\nin the digestive tract and mouth. Gentle guidance is alone necessary. Do\r\nnot use any force.\r\n\r\n5. Take up the required dose of inoculum into the syringe; insert the\r\nnozzle of the syringe into the needle-mount, and force the piston down.\r\n\r\n6. Steadying the needle-mount with the left hand, detach the syringe.\r\n\r\n7. Draw up some sterile water in the second (sterile) syringe, and\r\ninserting its nozzle into the needle-mount force a few drops of water\r\nthrough the tube to wash it out.\r\n\r\n8. With one quick upward movement remove the tube from the animal's\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\n9. Label, etc.\r\n\r\nOne other method of inoculation remains to be described, which does not\r\nrequire operative interference.\r\n\r\n~11. Feeding.~--\r\n\r\n1. _Fluid Inoculum._--Small pieces of sterilised bread or sop\r\n(sterilised in the steamer at 100 deg. C.) are soaked in the fluid\r\ninoculum and offered to the animals in a sterile Petri dish or capsule.\r\n\r\n2. _Solid Inoculum._--Small pieces of tissue are placed in sterile\r\nvessels and offered to the animals.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[12] This table is made by Messrs.

THE STUDY OF EXPERIMENTAL INFECTIONS DURING LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe possession of pathogenetic properties by an organism under study is\r\nindicated by the \"infection\" of the experimental animal--a term which is\r\nemployed to summarise the condition resulting from the successful\r\ninvasion of the tissues of the experimental animal by the\r\nmicro-organisms inoculated and by their multiplication therein.\r\nInfection is considered to have taken place:\r\n\r\n1. When the death of the animal is produced as a direct consequence of\r\nthe inoculation.\r\n\r\n2. When without necessarily producing death the inoculation causes local\r\nor general changes of a pathological character.\r\n\r\n3. When either with or without death, or local or general changes\r\noccurring, certain substances make their appearance in the body fluids,\r\nwhich can be shown (_in vitro_ or _in vivo_) to exert some profound and\r\nspecific effect when brought into contact with subcultivations of the\r\norganism originally inoculated.\r\n\r\nThe important factors in the production of infection are:\r\n\r\nA. Seed.  Virulence of organism.\r\n          Dose of organism.\r\n\r\nB. Soil.  Resistance offered by the cells of the experimental animal.\r\n\r\nThe first two factors, although variable, are to a certain extent under\r\nthe control of the experimenter. Thus by suitable means the virulence of\r\nan organism can be exalted or attenuated, whilst the size of the dose\r\nmay be increased or diminished. The third factor also varies, not only\r\namongst different species of animals, but also amongst different\r\nindividuals of the same species. The essential causes of this variation\r\nare not so obvious, so that beyond selecting the animals intended for\r\nsimilar experiments with regard to such points as age, size or sex, but\r\nlittle can be done to standardise cell resistance.\r\n\r\nImmediately an animal has been inoculated a period of clinical\r\nobservation must be entered upon, which should only terminate with the\r\ndeath of the animal. The general observations should at first and if the\r\ninfection is an acute one, be made daily--later, and if the animal\r\nappears to be unaffected or if the infection is chronic, both general\r\nand special observations should be carried out at weekly intervals. If\r\nthe animal appears to be still unaffected, it should be killed with\r\nchloroform vapour at the end of two or three months and a complete\r\npost-mortem carried out.\r\n\r\nA. The ~general observations~ should take cognisance of:\r\n\r\n1. _General appearance._ The experimental animal should be inspected\r\ndaily, not only with a view to detecting symptoms due to the\r\nexperimental infection, but also to prevent any intercurrent infection,\r\nnaturally acquired, from escaping notice (_vide_ page 337).\r\n\r\n2. _The weight_ of the inoculated animal should be observed and recorded\r\neach day during the course of an experimental infection at precisely the\r\nsame hour, preferably just before the morning feed.\r\n\r\n3. _The temperature_ should similarly be recorded daily, if not more\r\nfrequently, during the whole period the animal is under observation, and\r\ncarefully charted--individual variations will at once become apparent.\r\nIt should be borne in mind that the temperature regarded as normal for\r\nman (37.5 deg.

The accompanying table of normal\r\naverages for the animals usually employed in bacteriological research\r\nmay be of use in preventing the erroneous assumption that pyrexia is\r\npresent in an animal, which merely shows its own normal temperature.\r\n\r\n                  NORMAL AVERAGES.\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\n                |  Rectal  | Pulse. | Respirations.\r\n    Animal.     |   Temp.  |------------------------\r\n                |  deg.

Any _local reaction_ at the site of inoculation and any other readily\r\naccessible lesion should be carefully investigated. Any suppurative\r\nprocess which may occur, whether in the subcutaneous tissues or in\r\njoints, should be explored and the pus carefully examined both\r\nmicroscopically and culturally.\r\n\r\nFluid secretions and excretions, such as pus or serous exudates when\r\naccessible are collected direct from the body in sterile capillary\r\npipettes (_vide_ Fig. 13a,) in the following manner:\r\n\r\n1. Open the case containing the pipettes, grasp one by the plugged end,\r\nremove it from the case, and replace the lid of the latter.\r\n\r\n2. Attach a rubber teat (_vide_ page 10) to the plugged end of the\r\npipette and use the teat as the handle of the pipette.\r\n\r\n3. Pass the entire length of the pipette twice or thrice through the\r\nflame of the Bunsen burner.\r\n\r\n4. Snap off the sealed end of the pipette with a pair of sterile\r\nforceps.\r\n\r\n5. Compress the india-rubber teat, thrust the point of the pipette into\r\nthe secretion; now relax the pressure on the teat and allow the pipette\r\nto fill.\r\n\r\n6. Remove the point of the pipette from the secretion, allow the fluid\r\nto run a short distance up the capillary stem and seal the point of the\r\npipette in the flame. (If using a pipette with a constriction below the\r\nplugged mouthpiece (Fig 13b), this portion of the pipette may also be\r\nsealed in the flame.)\r\n\r\nWhen ready to examine the morbid material snap off the sealed end of the\r\npipette with sterile forceps and eject the contents of the pipette into\r\na sterile capsule. The material can now be utilized for cover-slip\r\npreparations, cultivations and inoculation experiment.\r\n\r\n3. _The peripheral blood_ should be examined from time to time for from\r\nthis tissue is often obtained the fullest information as to the course\r\nand progress of an infection.\r\n\r\na. The ~histological examination of the blood~ should be directed\r\nchiefly to observations on the number and kind of white cells; and since\r\nbut few bacteriologists are at the same time expert comparative\r\nhaematologists, some notes on the normal characters of the blood of the\r\ncommoner laboratory animals, contrasted with those of man, are inserted\r\nfor reference. These have been very kindly compiled for me by my friend\r\nand one time colleague Dr. Cecil Price Jones.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPARATIVE HAEMOCYTOLOGY OF LABORATORY ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n       |       Totals    |                Percentages\r\n       |------------------------------------------------------------\r\nAnimal |          |      | Hb, |Lympho-|Large |Poly- |Eosin-| Mast\r\n       |Red cells |White | per | cytes,|monos,|morph,| oph, |cells,\r\n       |          | cells|cent.|  per  | per  | per  | per  | per\r\n       |          |      |     | cent. | cent.| cent.|cent. |cent.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nFrog   |   490,000| 8,000|  58 |   40  | 10.0 | 22.0 |15    | 13\r\nMouse  | 8,700,000| 8,000|  78 |   60  | 21.5 | 17.0 | 1.4  |  0.1\r\nRat    | 9,000,000| 9,000|  85 |   54  |  7.0 | 37.5 | 1.3  |  0.2\r\nGuinea-|          |      |     |       |      |      |      |\r\n  pig  | 5,700,000|10,000|  99 |   55  |  9.0 | 32.8 | 3.0  |  0.2\r\nRabbit | 6,000,000| 7,000|  70 |   50  |  2.0 | 46.0 | 0.6  |  1.4\r\nRhesus | 4,500,000|13,000|  77 |   43  |  5.0 | 50.0 | 1.3  |  0.7\r\nGoat   |14,600,000|15,000|  58 |   35  |  6.3 | 56.7 | 1.25 |  0.75\r\nFowl   | 3,500,000|30,000| 100 |   49  |  3.0 | 42.0 | 1.0  |  5.0\r\nPigeon | 3,500,000|20,000| 101 |   43  |  9.0 | 43.0 | 3.0  |  2.0\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nMan    |          |      |     |       |      |      |      |\r\n(adult)| 5,000,000| 7,500| 100 |   25  |  5.5 | 65   | 4.0  |  0.5\r\nNormal | (4.5-5)  | (7-9)|(95- |(20-30)| (4-8)|(55-  |(3-5) |(0.5-2)\r\nlimits.| millions.| thou-| 101)|       |      |  68) |      |\r\n       |          |sands.|     |       |      |      |      |\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe above table represents in each case the average of a large number of\r\ncounts.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS.\r\n\r\n_Frog._--The _red cells_ are large oval nucleated (20-25 mu by 12-15 mu)\r\ndiscs, the nucleus relatively small and irregularly elongated or oval,\r\nabout 10 mu in length. Many primitive and developing forms are usually\r\nobserved--also free nuclei and many cells in various stages of\r\ndegeneration. Haemoglobin estimation is difficult owing to turbidity of\r\nthe blood after dilution with water. The _polymorphonuclear_ leucocytes\r\nare large cells, about 20 mu; no definite granules can be observed. The\r\n_eosinophile_ cells contain large deeply staining coccal-shaped\r\ngranules.\r\n\r\n_Mouse._--The granules of the _polymorphonuclear_ leucocytes are usually\r\nnot stained, or only very faintly so. The nucleus of the _eosinophile\r\ncell_ is ring-shaped or much divided, and the granules are coccal and\r\nstain oxyphile. The remarkable character of the blood is the high\r\npercentage of large _mononuclear_ cells.\r\n\r\n_Rat._--The fine rod-shaped granules of the _polymorphonuclear_\r\nleucocytes are usually very faintly stained. The granules of\r\n_eosinophile_ cells are well stained and coccal-shaped, the nucleus is\r\noften ring shaped. The _basophile_ granular cells are few--but the\r\ngranules are large, and stain deeply basophile.\r\n\r\n_Guinea-pig._--Polychromasia and punctate basophilia of _red cells_ are\r\nvery commonly observed--nucleated red cells are also frequent. The large\r\n_mononuclear_ cells often contain vacuoles--\"Kurlow cells\"--possibly of\r\na parasitic nature.\r\n\r\n_Rabbit._--It is not uncommon to find nucleated _red cells_ in films\r\nfrom quite healthy animals. The granules of the _polymorphonuclear_\r\nleucocytes stain oxyphile. The coarse granules of the _eosinophile_\r\ncells appear to stain less deeply oxyphile, probably owing to the\r\nbasophile staining of the cytoplasm.\r\n\r\n_Rhesus monkey._--The blood cells resemble those met with in human\r\nblood. The minute neutrophile granules of the _polymorphonuclear_\r\nleucocytes are often very scanty, and sometimes apparently absent. The\r\n_eosinophile_ cells are not so densely packed with coarse oxpyhile\r\ngranules as in the human eosinophile, and the nuclei of these cells are\r\nusually much divided, or polymorphous.\r\n\r\n_Goat._--The _red cells_ are small, nonnucleated discs, only about 4.5\r\nmu diameter, not much more than half that of the human red cell. The\r\n_polymorphonuclear_ leucocytes have only a few very minute\r\ncoccal-shaped oxyphile granules, the nucleus is polymorphous. The\r\n_eosinophile_ cells are large cells up to 20 mu, the cytoplasm is\r\nbasophile and contains coarse coccal-shaped oxyphile granules, and the\r\nnucleus is often much divided.\r\n\r\n_Fowl._--The _red cells_ are oval nucleated discs about 12 mu by 6 mu, the\r\nnucleus being relatively small (about 4 mu long), irregularly elongated or\r\noval; round, more deeply stained cells with round or diffuse nuclei,\r\nalso free nuclei and degenerated forms of red cells are often present.\r\nThe granules of the cells corresponding to the _polymorphonuclear_\r\nleucocytes are rod-shaped, often beaded or with clubbed ends. The\r\nnucleus is not polymorphous, but usually divided into two, though it may\r\nbe single. The cells probably corresponding to _eosinophile_ leucocytes\r\nhave fine coccal-shaped granules, faintly staining eosinophile or\r\nneutrophile. The basophile granules of the \"mast\" cells are\r\ncoccal-shaped, of various size--often quite powdery.\r\n\r\n_Pigeon._--_Red cells_ resemble those of the fowl, and similar varieties\r\nof appearance may be noted. The granules of those cells which correspond\r\nto _polymorphonuclear_ leucocytes are rod-shaped, but smaller and finer\r\nthan in the fowl, and do not show clubbed appearances. The nucleus is\r\nnot polymorphous, and only occasionally divided. The coccal-shaped\r\ngranules of the _eosinophile_ cells are stained more deeply oxyphile\r\nthan those of the corresponding cells of the fowl.\r\n\r\n_The preparation of dried films_ for this histological examination of\r\nthe blood is carried out as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Small samples of blood for the preparation of blood films are most\r\nconveniently obtained from the veins of the ear in most of the ordinary\r\nlaboratory animals, viz., monkey, goat, dog, cat, rabbit, guinea-pig; in\r\nthe pigeon and fowl the axillary vein should be punctured; in the rat\r\nand mouse either a vein in the ear or preferably by wounding the tip of\r\nthe tail; in the frog, the web of the foot should be selected.\r\n\r\n2. Puncture the selected vein with a sharp needle. A flat Hagedorn\r\nneedle (size No. 8) with a cutting edge is the most useful for this\r\npurpose. If the vein cannot be distended by proximal compression,\r\nvigourous friction with a piece of dry lint may have the desired\r\neffect--or a test-tube full of water at about 40 deg. C. may be placed\r\nclose to the vein. Failing these methods, a drop or two of xylol may be\r\ndropped on the skin just over the vein, left on for a few seconds and\r\nthen wiped off with a piece of dry lint.\r\n\r\n3. One of the short ends of a 3 by 1 glass slip is brought into contact\r\nwith the exuding drop of blood, so that it picks up a small drop.\r\n\r\n4. The slide is then lowered transversely on to the surface of a second\r\n3 by 1 slip, which rests on the bench near to one end at an angle of\r\nabout 45 deg., and retained in this position for a few seconds, while the\r\ndrop of blood spreads along the whole of the line of contact (see also\r\nFig. 69).\r\n\r\n5. Draw the first slide firmly and evenly along the entire length of the\r\nlower slide, leaving a thin regular film which will probably show the\r\nblood cells only one layer thick.\r\n\r\n6. Allow the film to dry in the air.\r\n\r\n7. Stain with one of the polychrome blood stains (see page 97).\r\n\r\n8. Examine microscopically.\r\n\r\nb. The ~bacteriological examination of the blood~ is directed solely to\r\nthe demonstration of the presence in the circulating blood of the\r\norganisms previously injected into the animal. For this purpose several\r\ncubic centimetres of blood should be taken in an all-glass syringe from\r\nan accessible vein corresponding to one of those suggested as the site\r\nof intravenous inoculation--and under similar aseptic precautions.\r\n\r\n1. Sterilise an all-glass syringe of suitable size, and when cool draw\r\ninto the syringe some sterile sodium citrate solution and moisten the\r\nwhole of the interior of the barrel; then eject all the citrate solution\r\nif less than 5 c.c. blood are to be withdrawn; if more than 5 c.c. are\r\nrequired retain about half a cubic centimetre of the fluid in the\r\nsyringe. This prevents coagulation of the blood.\r\n\r\nThe sodium citrate solution is prepared by dissolving:\r\n\r\n    Sodium citrate           10 gramme.\r\n    Sodium chloride           0.75 grammes.\r\n    In distilled water      100 c.c.\r\n\r\nSterilise by boiling.\r\n\r\n2. Prepare the animal as for intravenous inoculation (see page 363) and\r\nintroduce the syringe needle into the lumen of the selected vein.\r\n\r\n3. Slowly withdraw the piston of the syringe. When sufficient blood has\r\nbeen collected direct the assistant to release the proximal compression\r\nof the vein; and withdraw the needle.\r\n\r\n4. Remove the needle from the nozzle of the syringe and deliver the\r\ncitrated blood into a small Ehlenmeyer flask containing about 250 c.c.\r\nof nutrient broth.\r\n\r\n5. Label, incubate and examine daily until growth occurs or until the\r\nexpiration of ten days.\r\n\r\nc. The ~serological examination of the blood~ is directed to the\r\ndemonstration of the presence of certain specific antibodies in the sera\r\nof experimentally infected animals, and within certain limits to an\r\nestimation of their amounts.\r\n\r\nThe chief of these bodies are:\r\n\r\n    Antitoxin.\r\n    Agglutinin.\r\n    Precipitin.\r\n    Opsonin.\r\n    Immune body or Bacteriolysin.\r\n\r\nNone of these substances are capable of isolation in a state of purity\r\napart from the blood serum, consequently special methods have been\r\nelaborated to permit of their recognition. In every instance the\r\nbehaviour of serum from the experimental animal, which may be termed\r\n\"specific\" serum, is studied in comparison with that of serum from an\r\nuninoculated animal of the same species, and which is termed \"normal\"\r\nserum. In view of minor differences in constitution exhibited by the\r\nserum of various individuals of the same series, it is usual to employ a\r\nmixture of sera obtained from several different normal animals of the\r\nsame species as the inoculated animal, under the term \"pooled serum.\"\r\nThe method of collecting blood (e. g., from the rabbit) for\r\nserological tests is as follows:\r\n\r\n~Collection of Serum.~\r\n\r\n_Apparatus required:_\r\n\r\n    Razor.\r\n    Liquid soap.\r\n    Cotton-wool.\r\n    Lysol 2 per cent. solution, in drop bottle.\r\n    Ether in drop bottle.\r\n    Flat Hagedorn needles.\r\n    Blood pipettes (Fig. 16, page 12).\r\n    Centrifugal machine.\r\n    Centrifuge tubes.\r\n    Glass cutting knife.\r\n    Bunsen flame.\r\n    Writing diamond or grease pencil.\r\n\r\nMETHOD.\r\n\r\n1. Shave the dorsal surface of the ear over the course of the posterior\r\nauricular vein (see Fig. 192).\r\n\r\n2. Sterilise the skin by washing with lysol.\r\n\r\nThe lysol should be applied with sterile cotton-wool and the ear\r\nvigourously rubbed, not only to remove superficial scales of epithelium,\r\nbut also to render the ear hyperaemic and the vein prominent.\r\n\r\n3. Remove the lysol with ether dropped from a drop bottle, and allow the\r\nether to evaporate.\r\n\r\n4. Puncture the vein with a sterile Hagedorn needle.\r\n\r\n5. Take a small blood-collecting pipette (Fig. 161) and hold it at an\r\nangle to the ear, one end touching the issuing drop of blood, the other\r\ndepressed.\r\n\r\nThe blood will now enter the pipette at first by capillarity; afterward\r\ngravity will also come into play and the pipette can be two-thirds\r\nfilled without difficulty.\r\n\r\n6. Hold the tube by the end containing the blood, the clean end pointing\r\nobliquely upward--warm this end at the bunsen flame to expel some of the\r\ncontained air; then seal the clean point in the flame.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 192.--Collecting blood from rabbit.]\r\n\r\n7. Place the pipette down on a cool surface (e. g., a glass slide).\r\nThe rapid cooling of the air in the clean end of the pipette creates a\r\nnegative pressure, and the blood is sucked back into the pipette,\r\nleaving the soiled end free from blood. Seal this end in the bunsen\r\nflame.\r\n\r\n8. Mark the distinctive title of the specimen (e. g., animal's number)\r\nupon the pipette with a writing diamond or grease pencil.\r\n\r\n9. When the sealed ends are cold and the blood has clotted, place the\r\npipette on the centrifuge, clean end downward; counterpoise and\r\ncentrifugalise thoroughly. On removing the pipette from the centrifuge,\r\nthe red cells will be collected in a firm mass at one end, and above\r\nthem will appear the clear serum.\r\n\r\n10. By marking the blood pipette above the level of the serum with the\r\nglass cutting knife and snapping the tube at that point, the blood-serum\r\nbecomes readily accessible for testing purposes.\r\n\r\nIf larger quantities of blood are required, the animal, after puncturing\r\nthe vein, should be inverted, an assistant holding it up by the legs.\r\nBlood to the volume of several cubic centimetres will now drop from the\r\npunctured vein, and should be caught in a tapering centrifuge tube, the\r\ntube transferred to the incubator at 37 deg. C. for two hours, then\r\nplaced in the centrifugal machine, counterpoised and centrifugalised\r\nthoroughly. The three most important of the antibodies referred to which\r\ncan be demonstrated with a certain amount of facility are agglutinin,\r\nopsonin and bacteriolysin; and the methods of testing for these bodies\r\nwill now be considered.\r\n\r\n\r\nAGGLUTININ.\r\n\r\nAgglutinin is the name given to a substance present in the blood-serum\r\nof an animal that has successfully resisted inoculation with a certain\r\nmicro-organism. This substance possesses the power of collecting\r\ntogether in clumps and masses, or agglutinating watery suspensions of\r\nthat particular microbe.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Dilution of the Specific Serum~:\r\n\r\n_Apparatus required_:\r\n\r\nSterile graduated capillary pipettes to contain 10 c. mm. (Fig. 17).\r\nSterile graduated capillary pipettes to contain 90 c. mm. (Fig. 17).\r\nSmall sterile test-tubes 5 x 0.5 cm.\r\nNormal saline solution in flask or test-tube.\r\nPipette of specific serum.\r\nGlass cutting knife, or three-square file.\r\nGlass capsule, nearly full of dry silver sand, or roll of plasticine.\r\nGrease pencil.\r\n\r\nMETHOD.--\r\n\r\n1. Take three sterile test-tubes and number them 1, 2 and 3.\r\n\r\n2. Pipette 0.9 c.c. sterile normal saline solution into each tube, and\r\nstand tubes upright in the sand in the capsule, or in the plasticine\r\nblock.\r\n\r\n3. Make a scratch with the glass cutting knife on the blood pipette\r\nabove the upper level of the clear serum, and snap off and discard the\r\nempty portion of the tube.\r\n\r\n4. Remove 0.1 c.c. of the serum from the blood pipette tube, and mix it\r\nthoroughly with the fluid in tube No. 1; and label ~s.s.~, (specific\r\nserum), 10 per cent.\r\n\r\n5. Remove 0.1 c.c. of the solution from tube No. 1 by means of a fresh\r\npipette, and mix it with the contents of tube No. 2; and label ~s.s.~, 1\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\n6. Remove 0.1 c.c. of the solution from tube No. 2 by means of a fresh\r\npipette, and mix it with the contents of tube No. 3; and label ~s.s.~, 0.1\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\nWhen the yield of serum from the specimen of blood which has been\r\ncollected, or is available, is small, the above method of diluting is\r\nnot practicable, and the dilution should be carried out by Wright's\r\nmethod in a capillary teat pipette.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Dilution of Serum by Means of a Teat Pipette.~\r\n\r\n_Materials required:_\r\n\r\n    Blood pipette containing sample of specific serum after\r\n      centrifugalisation.\r\n    Capsule of diluting fluid--normal saline solution.\r\n    Supply of Pasteur pipettes (Fig. 13a).\r\n    India-rubber teats.\r\n    Small test-tubes.\r\n    A block of plasticine to act as a test-tube stand.\r\n    Grease pencil.\r\n\r\nMETHOD:\r\n\r\n1. Mark three small test-tubes 10 per cent., 1 per cent. and 0.1 per\r\ncent. respectively, and stand them upright in the plasticine block.\r\n\r\n2. Take a Pasteur pipette, nick the capillary stem just above the sealed\r\nend with a glass cutting knife, and snap off the sealed end with a quick\r\nmovement so that the fracture is clean cut and at right angles to the\r\nlong axis of the capillary stem--cut \"square\", in fact. Prepare several,\r\nsay a dozen, in this manner.\r\n\r\n3. Fit a rubber teat to the barrel of each of the pipettes.\r\n\r\n4. Make a mark with the grease pencil on the stem of one of the pipettes\r\nabout 2 or 3 cm. from the open extremity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 193.--Filling the capillary teat pipette.]\r\n\r\n5. Compress the teat between the finger and thumb (Fig. 193) to such an\r\nextent as to drive out the greater part of the contained air.\r\n\r\n6. Maintaining the pressure on the teat pass the stem of the pipette\r\ninto the capsule holding the saline solution, until the open end of the\r\npipette is below the level of the fluid.\r\n\r\n7. Now cautiously relax the pressure on the teat and let the fluid enter\r\nthe pipette and rise in the stem until it reaches the level of the\r\ngrease pencil mark. As soon as this point is reached, check the movement\r\nof the column of fluid by maintaining the pressure on the teat, neither\r\nrelaxing nor increasing it.\r\n\r\n8. Withdraw the point of the pipette clear of the fluid, and again relax\r\nthe pressure on the teat very slightly. The column of saline solution\r\nrises higher in the stem, and a column of air will now enter the pipette\r\nand serve as an index to separate the first volume of fluid drawn into\r\nthe stem from the next succeeding one.\r\n\r\n9. Again introduce the end of the pipette into the fluid and draw up a\r\nsecond volume of saline to the level of the grease pencil mark, and\r\nfollow this with a second air index.\r\n\r\n10. In like manner take up seven more equal volumes of saline solution\r\nand their following air bubbles. There are now nine equal volumes of\r\nnormal saline in the pipette.\r\n\r\n11. Now pass the point of the pipette into the blood tube and dip the\r\nopen end below the surface of the serum. Proceeding as before, aspirate\r\na volume of serum into the capillary stem up to the level of the pencil\r\nmark.\r\n\r\n12. Eject the contents of the pipette into the small tube marked 10 per\r\ncent. by compressing the rubber teat between thumb and finger.\r\n\r\n13. Mix the one volume of serum with the nine volumes of saline solution\r\nvery thoroughly by repeatedly drawing up the whole of the fluid into the\r\npipette and driving it out again into the test-tube.\r\n\r\n14. Now take a clean pipette and proceed precisely as before, 4 to 10.\r\n\r\n15. Having aspirated nine equal volumes of saline into this second\r\npipette, now take up one similar volume of the fluid in the \"10 per\r\ncent. tube.\"\r\n\r\n16. Eject the contents of this pipette into the second tube marked 1 per\r\ncent. and mix thoroughly as before.\r\n\r\n17. In similar fashion make the 0.1 per cent. solution and transfer to\r\nthe third tube.\r\n\r\n18. Further dilutions in multiples of ten can be prepared in the same\r\nway, and by varying the number of volumes of diluting fluid or serum any\r\nrequired dilution can be made (see Appendix, Dilution Tables).\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--The saline diluting fluid _must always_ be taken into\r\n     the pipette first, otherwise if the serum contains a very\r\n     large amount of agglutinin the traces of this serum added to\r\n     the saline solution may be sufficient to entirely vitiate\r\n     the subsequent observations--whilst if more than one sample\r\n     of serum is diluted from the same saline solution serious\r\n     errors may be introduced into the experiments.\r\n\r\n\r\n~The Microscopical Reaction:~\r\n\r\n_Apparatus Required:_\r\n\r\n     Five hanging-drop slides (or preferably two slide), with two\r\n     cells mounted side by side on each (Fig. 62, a), and one\r\n     slide with one cell only.\r\n\r\n     Vaseline.\r\n\r\n     Cover-slips.\r\n\r\n     Platinum loop.\r\n\r\n     Grease pencil.\r\n\r\n     Eighteen to twenty-four-hour-old bouillon cultivation of the\r\n     organism to be tested (e. g., Bacillus typhi abdominalis)\r\n\r\n     Pipette end with the remainder of the specific serum\r\n     labelled ~s.s.~\r\n\r\n     Tubes containing the three solutions of the specific serum,\r\n     10, 1, and 0.1 per cent. respectively.\r\n\r\n     Pipette end with pooled normal serum labelled ~p.s.~\r\n\r\nMETHOD.--\r\n\r\n1. Make five hanging-drop preparations, thus:\r\n\r\n(a) One loopful of bouillon cultivation + one loopful pooled serum;\r\nlabel \"Control.\"\r\n\r\n(b) One loopful culture + one loopful undiluted specific serum; label\r\n50 per cent.\r\n\r\nMount these two cover-slips on a double-celled slide.\r\n\r\n(c) One loopful bouillon culture + one loopful 10 per cent. serum;\r\nlabel 5 per cent.\r\n\r\nMount this on single-cell slide.\r\n\r\n(d) One loopful bouillon culture + one loopful 1 per cent. serum;\r\nlabel 0.5 per cent.\r\n\r\n(e) One loopful bouillon culture + one loopful 0.1 per cent. serum;\r\nlabel 0.05 per cent.\r\n\r\nMount these two cover-slips on a double-celled slide.\r\n\r\n2. Note the time: Examine the control to determine that the bacilli are\r\nmotile and uniformly scattered over the field--not collected into\r\nmasses.\r\n\r\n3. Next examine the 50 per cent. serum preparation.\r\n\r\nIf agglutinin is present and the test is giving a positive reaction, the\r\nbacilli _will_ be collected in large clumps.\r\n\r\nIf the test is giving a negative reaction, the bacilli _may_ be\r\ncollected in large clumps owing to the viscosity of the concentrated\r\nserum.\r\n\r\n4. Observe the 5 per cent. preparation microscopically.\r\n\r\nIf the bacilli are aggregated into clumps, positive reaction.\r\n\r\nIf the bacilli are _not_ aggregated into clumps, observe until thirty\r\nminutes from the time of preparation before recording a negative\r\nreaction.\r\n\r\n5. Examine the 0.5 and 0.05 per cent. preparations.\r\n\r\nThese may or may not show agglutination when the result of the\r\nexamination of the 5 per cent. preparation is positive, according to the\r\npotency of the specific serum; and by the examination of a series of\r\ndilutions a quantitative comparison of the valency of specific sera from\r\ndifferent sources, or of serum from the same animal at different periods\r\nduring the course of active immunisation may be obtained.\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--The graduated pipettes supplied with Thoma's\r\n     haematocytometer (intended for the collection of the specimen\r\n     of blood required for the enumeration of leucocytes), giving\r\n     a dilution of 1 in 10--i. e., 10 per cent.--may be\r\n     substituted for the graduated capillary pipettes referred to\r\n     above, if the vessel in which the serum has been separated\r\n     is of sufficiently large diameter to permit of their use.\r\n\r\n\r\n~The Macroscopical Reaction:~\r\n\r\n     Sterile graduated capillary pipettes to contain 90 c. mm.\r\n\r\n     Eighteen to twenty-four-hours-old bouillon cultivation of\r\n     the organism to be tested.\r\n\r\n     Three test-tubes containing the 10, 1, and 0.1 per cent.\r\n     solutions of specific serum (about 90 c. mm. remaining in\r\n     each).\r\n\r\n     Tube containing 50 per cent. solution of pooled serum.\r\n\r\n     Sedimentation pipettes (_vide_ page 17) or teat pipettes.\r\n\r\nMETHOD.\r\n\r\n1. Pipette 90 c. mm. of the bouillon culture into each of the tubes\r\ncontaining the diluted serum; and the same quantity into the tube\r\ncontaining the pooled serum.\r\n\r\n2. Fill a sedimentation tube (by aspirating) or a teat pipette from the\r\ncontents of each tube. Seal off the lower ends of the sedimentation\r\ntubes in the Bunsen flame.\r\n\r\n3. Label each tube with the dilution of serum that it contains--viz., 5,\r\n0.5, and 0.05 per cent.\r\n\r\n4. Place the pipettes in a vertical position, in a beaker, in the\r\nincubator at 37 deg. C., for one or two hours.\r\n\r\n5. Observe the granular precipitate which is thrown down when the\r\nreaction is positive, and the uniform turbidity of the negative reaction\r\nas compared with the appearances in the control pooled serum.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPSONIN.\r\n\r\nOpsonin is the term applied by Wright to a substance, present in the\r\nserum of an inoculated animal, which is able to act upon or sensitise\r\nbacteria of the species originally injected, so as to render them an\r\neasy prey to the phagocytic activity of polymorphonuclear leucocytes. In\r\nthe method for demonstrating opsonin about to be described, a comparison\r\nis made between the opsonic \"power\" of the pooled serum and the specific\r\nserum.\r\n\r\n     _Apparatus:_\r\n\r\n     Small centrifuge and tubes for same (made from the barrels\r\n     of broken capillary pipettes by sealing the conical ends in\r\n     the bunsen flame).\r\n\r\n     Capillary Pasteur pipettes.\r\n\r\n     India-rubber teats.\r\n\r\n     Grease pencil.\r\n\r\n     Bunsen burner with peep flame.\r\n\r\n     Electrical signal clock (see page 39) stop watch, or watch.\r\n\r\n     Rectangular glass box or tray to hold pipettes.\r\n\r\n     Incubator regulated at 37 deg. C.\r\n\r\n     3 x 1 slides.\r\n\r\n     Piece of light rubber tubing.\r\n\r\n     Rectangular block of plasticine.\r\n\r\n     Flask of normal saline solution.\r\n\r\n     Flask of sodium citrate (1.5 per cent.) in normal saline\r\n     solution.\r\n\r\n     _Materials required_, and their preparation:\r\n\r\n     Small tube of \"washed cells\" (red blood discs and\r\n     leucocytes); human cells are used in estimating the\r\n     opsonising power of the serum of experimental animals.\r\n\r\n     Small tube of emulsion of bacteria of the species\r\n     responsible for the infection of the experimental animal.\r\n\r\n     Blood pipette containing specific serum.\r\n\r\n     Blood pipette containing \"pooled\" serum.\r\n\r\n_Washed Cells._--\r\n\r\n1. Take a small centrifuge tube and half fill it with sodium citrate\r\nsolution. Mark with the grease pencil the upper limit of the fluid.\r\n\r\n2. Cleanse the skin of the distal phalanx of the second finger of the\r\nleft hand above the root of the nail with lint and ether. Wind the\r\nrubber tubing tightly round the second phalanx; puncture with a sterile\r\nHagedorn needle through the cleansed area of skin.\r\n\r\n3. Take up a sufficiency of the issuing blood (more or less according to\r\nthe number of tests to be performed) with a teat pipette, transfer it to\r\nthe tube of citrate solution and mix thoroughly. Make a second mark on\r\nthe tube at the upper level of the mixed citrate solution and blood.\r\n\r\n4. Place the tube in the centrifuge, counterpoise accurately and\r\ncentrifugalise until the blood cells are thrown down in a compact mass\r\noccupying approximately the same volume as is included between the two\r\npencil marks.\r\n\r\nThe column of fluid in the tube now shows clear supernatant fluid\r\n(citrate solution and blood plasma) separated from the sharp cut upper\r\nsurface of the red deposit of corpuscles by a narrow greyish layer of\r\nleucocytes.\r\n\r\n5. Remove the supernatant column of citrate solution by means of a teat\r\npipette, fill normal saline solution into the tube up to the upper\r\npencil mark, and distribute the blood cells throughout the saline by\r\nmeans of the teat pipette. Centrifugalise as before.\r\n\r\n6. Again remove the supernatant fluid and fill in a fresh supply of\r\nsaline solution and centrifugalise once more.\r\n\r\n7. Remove the supernatant saline solution as nearly down to the level of\r\nthe leucocytes as can be safely done without removing any of the\r\nleucocytes.\r\n\r\n8. Next distribute the leucocytes evenly throughout the mass of red\r\ncells by rotating the tube between the palms of the hands--just as is\r\ndone with a tube of liquefied medium prior to pouring a plate.\r\n\r\n9. Set the tube upright in the plasticine block near to one end.\r\n\r\n_Bacterial Emulsion._--\r\n\r\n1. Take an 18- to 24-hour culture of the required bacterium (e. g.,\r\nDiplococcus pneumoniae) grown upon sloped blood agar at 37 deg. C. Pour\r\nover the surface of the medium some 5 c.c. of normal saline solution.\r\n\r\n2. With a platinum loop emulsify the growth from the surface of the\r\nmedium as evenly as possible in the saline solution.\r\n\r\n3. Allow the tube to stand for a few minutes so that the large masses of\r\ngrowth may settle down; transfer the upper portion of the saline\r\nsuspension to a centrifuge tube and centrifugalise thoroughly.\r\n\r\n4. Examine a drop of the supernatant opalescent emulsion microscopically\r\nto determine its freedom from clumps and masses. If unsatisfactory\r\nprepare another emulsion, this time scraping up the surface growth with\r\na platinum spatula, transferring it to an agate mortar and grinding it\r\nup with successive small quantities of normal saline. If satisfactory\r\ninsert the tube in the plasticine block next to that containing the\r\nwashed cells.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Specific Serum.~--\r\n\r\n~Pooled Serum.~--\r\n\r\nThese sera are collected and treated as already described (see page\r\n379), and the portions of the blood pipettes containing them are\r\narranged in the remaining space in plasticine block.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 194.--Plasticine block with materials arranged for\r\nopsonin estimations.]\r\n\r\nThe plasticine block now presents the appearances shown in Fig. 194.\r\n\r\nMETHOD FOR DETERMINING THE OPSONIC INDEX.--\r\n\r\n1. Take a capillary pipette fitted with a teat, cut the distal end\r\n_square_ and make a pencil mark about 2 cm. from the end.\r\n\r\n2. Aspirate into the pipette one volume of washed cells, air index, one\r\nvolume of bacterial emulsion, air index, and one volume of specific\r\nserum (see Fig. 195).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 195. Opsonin pipette.]\r\n\r\n3. Mix thoroughly on a 3 by 1 slide by compressing the teat and ejecting\r\nthe contents of the pipette on to the surface of the slide, relaxing the\r\npressure and so drawing the fluid up into the pipette again. These two\r\nprocesses should be repeated several times; finally take up the mixture\r\nin an unbroken column to the central portion of the capillary stem.\r\n\r\n4. Seal the point of the pipette in the peep flame of the bunsen burner\r\nand remove teat.\r\n\r\n5. Mark the pipette (with the grease pencil) with the distinctive number\r\nof the serum and place it in the glass box or tray.\r\n\r\n6. Take another similarly prepared pipette and aspirate into it equal\r\nvolumes of washed cells, bacterial emulsion and pooled serum. Treat\r\nprecisely as in 3 and 4, label it \"control\" or \"N.S.\" (normal serum) and\r\nplace in the box by the side of the specific serum preparation.\r\n\r\n7. Place the box with the pipettes in the incubator and set the signal\r\nclock to ring at 15 minutes (or start the stop watch).\r\n\r\n8. At the expiration of the incubation time remove the pipettes from the\r\nincubator.\r\n\r\n9. Cut off the sealed end of the specific serum preparation. Mix its\r\ncontents thoroughly as in step 3, and then divide the mixture between\r\ntwo 3 by 1 slips and carefully spread a blood film (_vide_ page 376) on\r\neach in such a way that only one-half of the surface of each slide is\r\ncovered with blood--the free edge of the blood film approximating to the\r\nlongitudinal axis of the slide.\r\n\r\nAllow films to dry and label the slides with writing diamond.\r\n\r\n10. Treat the contents of the control pipette in similar fashion.\r\n\r\n11. Select the better film from each pair for fixing and staining.\r\n\r\n12. Fixing and staining must be carried out under strictly comparable\r\nconditions, and to this end the slides are best handled by placing in a\r\nglass staining rack which can be lowered in turn into each of a series\r\nof glass troughs containing the various reagents (Fig. 196). Place the\r\nrack in the first trough which contains the alcoholic solution of\r\nLeishman's stain for two minutes to fix.\r\n\r\nTransfer to the second trough containing the diluted stain for ten\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nTransfer to the third trough containing distilled water, and holding the\r\ntrough over a sink, run in a stream of distilled water until washing is\r\ncomplete. Remove slides from the rack and dry.\r\n\r\nLeishman's stain is the best for routine work for all bacteria other\r\nthan B. tuberculosis. Films containing tubercle bacilli must of course\r\nbe stained by the Ziehl Neelsen method.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 196. Glass staining trough for blood films.]\r\n\r\n13. Examine specific serum slide microscopically with 1/12 inch oil\r\nimmersion. Find the edge of the blood film--along this the bulk of the\r\nleucocytes will be collected. Starting at one end of the film move the\r\nslide slowly across the microscope stage and as each leucocyte comes\r\ninto view count and record the number of ingested bacteria. The sum of\r\nthe contents of the first 50 consecutive polymorphonuclears that are\r\nencountered is marked down. (The _average_ number of bacilli ingested\r\nper leucocyte = the \"_phagocytic index_.\")\r\n\r\n14. In precisely similar manner enumerate the bacteria present in the\r\nfirst 50 cells of the control preparation. This number is recorded as\r\nthe denominator of a vulgar fraction of which the numerator is the\r\nnumber recorded for the specific serum. This fraction, expressed as a\r\npercentage of unity = the _opsonic index_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMMUNE BODY.\r\n\r\nImmune body or amboceptor is the name given to a substance present in\r\nthe serum of an infected animal that has successfully resisted\r\ninoculation with some particular micro-organism, and which possesses the\r\npower of linking the complement normally present in the serum to\r\nbacteria of the species used as antigen in such a manner that the\r\nmicro-organisms are rendered innocuous, and ultimately destroyed. The\r\npresence of the immune body in the serum can be demonstrated _in vitro_\r\nby the reaction elaborated by Bordet and Gengou, known as the complement\r\nfixation test, the existence or the absence of the phenomenon of\r\ncomplement fixation being rendered obvious macroscopically by the\r\nabsence or presence of haemolysis on the subsequent addition of\r\n\"sensitised\" red blood corpuscles, (e. g., a mixture of crythrocyte\r\nsolution and the appropriate haemolysin--two of the three essentials in\r\nthe haemolytic system, _vide_ page 326).\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Apparatus Required:_\r\n\r\n     Sterile pipettes 1 c.c., (graduated in tenths).\r\n\r\n     16 x 2 cm. test-tubes.\r\n\r\n     9 x 1 cm. test-tubes.\r\n\r\n     Test-tube racks for each size of test-tube.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Reagents Required:_\r\n\r\n     Normal saline solution.\r\n\r\n     Erythrocyte solution (human red cells, page 329) = E.\r\n\r\n     Haemolytic serum (for human cells) = H.S.\r\n\r\n     Complement (fresh guinea-pig serum) = C.\r\n\r\n     Specific serum from inoculated animal, inactivated = S.S.\r\n\r\n     Control pooled serum from normal animals of same species,\r\n     Inactivated = P.S.\r\n\r\n     _Antigen_ (cultivation upon solid medium of the organism\r\n     (e. g., B. typhosus) which has already served as antigen\r\n     in the inoculation of the experimental animal) = A.\r\n\r\nTo prepare the antigen for use, emulsify the whole of the bacterial\r\ngrowth in 5 c.c. normal saline solution.\r\n\r\nShake the emulsion in a test-tube with some sterilised glass beads to\r\nensure a homogenous emulsion, and sterilise by heating to 60 deg. C. in\r\na water-bath for one hour.\r\n\r\nMETHOD.--\r\n\r\n1. Take five small test-tubes, and number them 1 to 5 with a grease\r\npencil.\r\n\r\n2. Into tubes Nos. 1, 3, 4 and 5 pipette 0.1 c.c. of complement.\r\n\r\n3. Into tubes Nos. 1 and 2 pipette 0.2 c.c. of the serum to be tested.\r\n\r\n4. Into tube No. 4 pipette 0.2 c.c. of control serum.\r\n\r\n5. Into tubes Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 pipette 1 c.c. of the bacterial\r\nemulsion which forms the antigen.\r\n\r\n6. Place the whole set of tubes in the incubator at 37 deg. C. for a\r\nperiod of one hour.\r\n\r\n7. Remove the tubes from the incubator and pipette 1 c.c. erythrocyte\r\nsolution and 4 minimal haemolytic doses of the corresponding haemolysin\r\ninto each tube.\r\n\r\n8. Mix thoroughly and return the tubes to the incubator at 37 deg. C.\r\nfor further period of one hour.\r\n\r\n9. At the expiration of that time transfer the tubes to the ice chest,\r\nand allow them to stand for three hours.\r\n\r\n10. Examine the tubes.\r\n\r\nTubes 3, 4 and 5 should show complete haemolysis; tube 2 should give no\r\nevidence whatever of haemolysis.\r\n\r\nThese tubes form the controls to the first tube, which contains the\r\nserum to be tested.\r\n\r\nIn tube No. 1 the absence of haemolysis would indicate the presence in\r\nthe serum of the inoculated animal of a specific antibody to the\r\nmicro-organism used in the inoculations; since it shows that the\r\ncomplement has been bound by the immune body to the bacterial antigen,\r\nand none has been left free to enter into the haemolytic system; on the\r\nother hand the presence of haemolysis would show that no appreciable\r\namount of antibody has yet been formed in response to the inoculations.\r\nIn other words, there is an absence of infection, since the complement\r\nremained unfixed at the time of the addition of the erythrocyte solution\r\nand haemolytic serum, and was ready to combine with those reagents to\r\ncomplete the haemolytic system.\r\n\r\nThe method may be shown diagramatically as under using the symbols\r\nalready indicated\r\n\r\n                       Test-tubes.\r\n\r\n     1              2               3               4               5\r\n\r\n0.1 c.c.

This is done\r\n     forty-five minutes after the experiment has been started\r\n     (page 394, step 6), that is to say, before the completion of\r\n     the first period of incubation, thus:\r\n\r\n     1. Measure out into a sterile test-tube (or flask) five c.c.\r\n     of erythrocyte solution.\r\n\r\n     2. Measure out twenty minimal haemolytic doses of haemolysin,\r\n     add to the erythrocyte solution on the test-tube.\r\n\r\n     3. Allow the erythrocyte and haemolysin to remain in contact\r\n     for fifteen minutes at room temperature. The red cells are\r\n     then sensitised and ready for use.\r\n\r\n     4. When the tubes are removed from the incubator at the end\r\n     of the first hour (i. e., step 7) add 1 c.c. sensitised\r\n     red cells to each tube by means of a graduated pipette.\r\n\r\n     5. Mix thoroughly, return the tubes to the incubator at\r\n     37 deg. C. and complete the experiment as previously described\r\n     (steps 8 onward).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX. POST-MORTEM EXAMINATIONS OF EXPERIMENTAL ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe post-mortem examination should be carried out as soon as possible\r\nafter the death of the animal, for it must be remembered that even in\r\ncold weather the tissues are rapidly invaded by numerous bacteria\r\nderived from the alimentary tract or the cavities of the body, and from\r\nexternal sources.\r\n\r\nThe following outlines refer to a complete and exhaustive necropsy, and\r\nin routine work the examination will rarely need to be carried out in\r\nits entirety.\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--Throughout the autopsy the searing irons must be\r\n     freely employed, and it must be recollected that one\r\n     instrument is only to be employed to seize or cut one\r\n     structure. This done, it must be regarded as contaminated\r\n     and a fresh instrument taken for the next step.\r\n\r\n~Apparatus Required~:\r\n\r\nWater steriliser.\r\n\r\n                           { Scalpels.\r\n    Surgical instruments:  { Scissors.\r\n                           { Forceps.\r\n                           { Bone forceps.\r\n\r\nSpear-headed platinum spatula (Fig. 199).\r\n\r\nSearing irons (Fig. 198).\r\n\r\nTubes of media--bouillon and sloped agar.\r\n\r\nSurface plates in petri dishes (of agar or one of its derivatives).\r\n\r\nPlatinum loop.\r\n\r\nAluminium \"spreader.\"\r\n\r\nGrease pencil.\r\n\r\nSterile capillary pipettes (Fig. 13, a).\r\n\r\nSterile glass capsules, large and small.\r\n\r\nCover-slips or slides.\r\n\r\nBottles of fixing fluid (_vide_ page 114) for pieces of tissue intended\r\nfor sectioning.\r\n\r\n1. Place the various instruments, forceps, scissors, scalpels, etc.,\r\nneeded for the autopsy inside the steriliser and sterilise by boiling\r\nfor ten minutes; then open the steriliser, raise the tray from the\r\ninterior and rest it crosswise on the edges.\r\n\r\n2. Heat the searing irons to redness in a separate gas stove.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 197.--Apparatus for post-mortem examination, animal\r\non board.]\r\n\r\n3. Drench the fur (or feathers) with lysol solution, 2 per cent. This\r\nserves the twofold purpose of preventing the hairs from flying about and\r\nentering the body cavities during the autopsy, and of rendering\r\ninnocuous any vermin that may be present on the animal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 198.--Searing iron.]\r\n\r\n4. Examine the cadaver carefully. Recollect that laboratory animals are\r\nnot always hardy; death may be due to exposure to heat or cold, to\r\nstarvation or over- or improper feeding or to the attack of rats--and\r\nnot to the bacterial infection.\r\n\r\n5. Fasten the body of the animal, ventral surface upward (unless there\r\nis some special reason for having the dorsum exposed), out on a board\r\nby means of copper nails driven through the extremities.\r\n\r\n6. With sterile forceps and scalpel incise the skin in the middle line\r\nfrom the top of the sternum to the pubes. Make other incisions at right\r\nangles to the first out to the axillae and groins, and reflect the skin\r\nin two lateral flaps. (Place the now infected instruments on the board\r\nby the side of the body or support them on a porcelain knife rest.)\r\n\r\n\r\n~Seat of Inoculation.~--\r\n\r\n7. Inspect the seat of inoculation. If any local lesion is visible, sear\r\nits exposed surface and with the platinum loop, remove material from the\r\ndeeper parts to make tube and surface plate cultivations and cover-slip\r\npreparations.\r\n\r\nCollect specimens of pus or other exudation in capillary pipettes for\r\nsubsequent examination.\r\n\r\n8. Inspect the neighbouring lymphatic glands and endeavour to trace the\r\npath of the virus.\r\n\r\n9. Sear the whole of the exposed surface of the thorax with the searing\r\nirons.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Pleural Cavity.~--\r\n\r\n10. Divide the ribs on either side of the sternum and remove a\r\nrectangular portion of the anterior chest wall with sterile scissors and\r\na fresh pair of forceps, exposing the heart. Place the infected\r\ninstruments by the side of the first set.\r\n\r\n11. Observe the condition of the anterior mediastinal glands, the thymus\r\nand the lungs. Collect a quantity of pleuritic effusion, if such is\r\npresent, in a pipette for further examination later.\r\n\r\n12. Raise the pericardial sac in a fresh pair of forceps and burn\r\nthrough this structure with a searing iron.\r\n\r\nCollect a sample of pericardial fluid in a pipette for microscopical and\r\ncultural examination.\r\n\r\n13. Grasp the apex of the heart in the forceps and sear the surface of\r\nthe right ventricle.\r\n\r\n14. Plunge the open point of a capillary pipette through the seared area\r\ninto the ventricle and fill with blood.\r\n\r\nMake cultivations and cover-slip preparations of the heart blood.\r\n\r\n15. Collect a further sample of blood or serum for subsequent\r\ninvestigation as to the presence of antibodies.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Peritoneal Cavity.~--\r\n\r\n16. Sear a broad track in the middle line of the abdominal wall; open\r\nthe peritoneal cavity by an incision in the centre of the seared line.\r\nObserve the condition of the omentum, the mesentery, the viscera and the\r\nperitoneal surface of the intestines.\r\n\r\n17. Collect a specimen of the peritoneal fluid (or pus, if present) in a\r\ncapillary pipette. Make cultivations, tube and surface plate, and\r\ncover-slip preparations from this situation.\r\n\r\n18. Collect a specimen of the urine from the distended bladder in a\r\nlarge pipette (in the manner indicated for heart blood), for further\r\nexamination, by cultivations, microscopical preparations, and chemical\r\nanalysis.\r\n\r\n19. Collect a specimen of bile from the gall bladder in similar manner.\r\n\r\n20. Excise the spleen and place it in a sterile capsule. Later, sear the\r\nsurface of this organ; plunge the spear-headed spatula through the\r\ncentre of the seared area, twist it round between the finger and thumb,\r\nand remove it from the organ. Sufficient material will be brought away\r\nin the eye in its head to make cultivations. A repetition of the process\r\nwill afford material for cover-slip preparations.\r\n\r\n21. Seize one end of the spleen with sterile forceps. Sear a narrow band\r\nof tissue, right around the organ and divide the spleen in this\r\nsituation with a pair of scissors. Holding the piece of spleen in the\r\nforceps, dab the cut surface on to a surface plate in a number of\r\ndifferent spots.\r\n\r\n22. In like manner examine the other organs--liver, lungs, kidneys,\r\nlymphatic glands (mesenteric, hepatic, lumbar, etc), etc. Prepare\r\ncultivations and cover-slip preparations.\r\n\r\n23. Dissect out a long bone from one upper and one lower limb and one of\r\nthe largest ribs. Prepare cultures from the bone marrow in each case.\r\nSet aside these bones for the subsequent preparation of marrow films.\r\n\r\n24. Film preparations of bone marrow are best made by the Price-Jones\r\nmethod. Seize the bone in a pair of pliers and squeeze out some of the\r\nmarrow; receive it in a platinum loop, and transfer to a watch glass of\r\ndissociating fluid and emulsify. The dissociating fluid is a neutral 10\r\nper cent. solution of glycerine prepared as follows:--\r\n\r\n     Measure out 10 c.c. Price's best glycerine and 90 c.c.\r\n     sterile ammonia-free distilled water. Mix. Titrate against\r\n     n/10 sodic hydrate solution using phenolphthalein as the\r\n     indicator. The initial reaction is usually + 0.1 to + 0.5;\r\n     add the calculated amount of n/10 sodic hydrate solution to\r\n     neutralise.\r\n\r\n25. Place a loopful of fresh desiccating fluid on a 3 x 1 glass slide;\r\nadd a similar loopful of the marrow emulsion, and spread very gently\r\nover the surface of the slip.\r\n\r\n26. Allow film to dry in the air (protected from dust) without heating.\r\n\r\n27. Stain with Jenner's polychrome stain (page 97) for two and a half\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n28. Wash with ammonia-free distilled water, dry thoroughly and mount in\r\nxylol balsam.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Cranial and Spinal Cavities.~--\r\n\r\n29. In some instances it may be necessary (e. g., experimental\r\ninoculation of rabies) to examine the cranial cavity or to remove the\r\nspinal cord. Return the viscera to the abdominal cavity; draw the flaps\r\nof skin together and secure with Michel's steel clips. Draw the copper\r\nnails securing the limbs to the board, reverse the animal and again nail\r\nthe limbs down--the body now being dorsum uppermost.\r\n\r\n30. Make a longitudinal incision in the mesial line from snout to root\r\nof tail, and four transverse incisions--one joining the roots of the two\r\nears, one across the body at the level of the spinis of the scapulae,\r\nanother at the level of the costal margin and the last across the upper\r\nlevel of the pelvis. Reflect these flaps of skin.\r\n\r\n31. With forceps and scalpel dissect out the muscles lying in the furrow\r\non either side of the spinal processes.\r\n\r\n32. Cut through the bases of the transverse processes with bone forceps.\r\nCut away the vault of the skull, cut through the roots of the nerves and\r\nremove the brain and spinal cord, place in a large glass dish for\r\nexamination. Prepare cultivations from the cerebro-spinal fluid. The\r\nremoval of the brain and cord is a tedious process and during the\r\ndissection it is difficult to avoid injury to these structures.\r\n\r\nThe operation is, however, carried out very expeditiously and neatly\r\nwith the aid of the surgical engine (_vide_ page 361). A small circular\r\nsaw is fitted to the hand piece. The bones of the skull are cut through\r\nand the whole of the vault removed, exposing the entire vertex of the\r\nbrain. Similarly all the spinous processes can be removed in one string\r\nby running the saw down first one side of the spinal column and then the\r\nother. In this way ample space for the removal of the nervous tissues is\r\nobtained with a minimum of labour.\r\n\r\n33. Having completed the preparation of cultures remove small portions\r\nof various organs at leisure and place each in separate bottles of\r\nfixing fluid for future sectioning. Affix to each bottle a label bearing\r\nall necessary details as to its contents.\r\n\r\n34. If necessary, remove portions of the organs for preservation and\r\ndisplay as museum specimens (_vide_ page 404).\r\n\r\n35. Gather up all the infected instruments, return them to the\r\nsteriliser, and disinfect by boiling for ten minutes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 199.--Spear-headed platinum spatula (actual size.)]\r\n\r\n36. Sprinkle dry sawdust into the exposed body cavities to absorb blood\r\nand fluid. Cover the body with blotting or filter paper, moistened with\r\n2 per cent. lysol solution. Place in a galvanised iron pail, provided\r\nwith a lid, ready for transport to the crematorium.\r\n\r\n37. Cremate the cadaver together with the board upon which it is fixed.\r\n\r\n38. Stain the cover-slip preparations by suitable methods and examine\r\nmicroscopically.\r\n\r\n39. Incubate the cultivations and examine carefully from day to day.\r\n\r\n40. Make full notes of the condition of the various body cavities and of\r\nthe viscera immediately the autopsy is completed; and add the result of\r\nthe microscopical and cultural investigation when available.\r\n\r\nAs part of the card index system in use in the author's laboratory\r\nalready referred to (_vide_ page 335) there is a special yellow card for\r\nP-M notes. On the face of the card are printed headings for various\r\ndata--some of which are sometimes unintentionally omitted--and on the\r\nreverse is a schematic figure which can be utilised for indicating the\r\nposition of the chief lesions in the cadaver of any of the laboratory\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nAUTOPSY CARD       Laboratory No. _________\r\n\r\nDate ________\r\n\r\nAnimal ______  No. in Series ______ [Symbols: male female] Weight ________\r\n+------------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\nDied (or killed) _____ o'clock ____ m.

Finally, the results of the action of the organism or organisms\r\nisolated may be correlated with the symptoms observed during life and\r\nthe observations summarised under the following headings:\r\n\r\nTissue changes:\r\n\r\n    1. Local--i. e., produced in the neighbourhood of the bacteria.\r\n\r\n       Position: (a) At primary lesion.\r\n\r\n                 (b) At secondary foci.\r\n\r\n       Character: (a) Vascular changes and tissue    }   Acute\r\n                      reactions.                     }    or\r\n                  (b) Degeneration and necrosis.     }   chronic.\r\n\r\n    2. General (i. e., produced at a distance from the bacteria, by\r\n       absorption of toxins):\r\n\r\n         (a) In special tissues--e. g., nerve cells and fibres, secreting\r\n             cells, vessel walls, etc.\r\n\r\n         (b) General effects of malnutrition, etc.\r\n\r\n    Symptoms:\r\n\r\n        (a) Associated with known tissue changes.\r\n\r\n        (b) Without known tissue changes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 201.--Back of post-mortem card.]\r\n\r\n\r\n~Permanent Preparations--Museum Specimens.~--\r\n\r\n_I. Tissues._--The naked-eye appearances of morbid tissues may be\r\npreserved by the following method:\r\n\r\n1. Remove the tissue or organ from the cadaver as soon after death as\r\npossible, using great care to avoid distortion or injury.\r\n\r\n2. Place it in a wide-mouthed stoppered jar, large enough to hold it\r\nconveniently, resting on a pad of cotton-wool, and arrange it in the\r\nposition it is intended to occupy (but if it is intended to show a\r\nsection of the tissue or organ, do not incise it yet).\r\n\r\n3. Cover with the Kaiserling fixing solution, and stopper the jar; allow\r\nthe tissues to remain in this solution for from forty-eight hours to\r\nseven days (according to size) to fix. Make any necessary sections.\r\n\r\nKaiserling modified solution is prepared as follows:\r\n\r\nWeigh out\r\n\r\n    Potassium acetate      30 grammes.\r\n    Potassium nitrate      15 grammes.\r\n\r\nand dissolve in\r\n\r\n    Distilled water        1000 c.c.\r\n\r\nthen add\r\n\r\n    Formalin               150 c.c.\r\n\r\nFilter.\r\n\r\nThis fixing solution can be used repeatedly so long as it remains clear.\r\nEven when it has become turbid, if simple filtration is sufficient to\r\nrender it clear, the filtrate may be used again.\r\n\r\n4. Transfer the tissue to a bath of methylated spirit (95 per cent.) for\r\nthirty minutes to one hour.\r\n\r\n5. Remove to a fresh bath of spirit and watch carefully. When the\r\nnatural colours show in their original tints, average time three to six\r\nhours, remove the tissues from the spirit bath, dry off the spirit from\r\nthe cut surfaces by mopping with a soft cloth, then transfer to the\r\nmounting solution.\r\n\r\nJore's mounting solution (modified) consists of\r\n\r\n    Glycerine                  500 c.c.\r\n    Distilled water            750 c.c.\r\n    Formalin                     2 c.c.\r\n\r\nEqually good but much cheaper is Frost's mounting solution:\r\n\r\n    Potassium acetate               160 grammes.\r\n    Sodium fluoride                  80 grammes.\r\n    Chloral hydrate                  80 grammes.\r\n    Cane sugar (Tate's cubes)     3,500 grammes.\r\n    Saturated thymol water        8,000 c.c.\r\n\r\n6. After twenty-four hours in this solution, or as soon as the tissue\r\nsinks, transfer to a museum jar, fill with fresh mounting solution, and\r\nseal.\r\n\r\n_6a._ Or transfer to museum jar and fill with liquefied gelatine, to\r\nwhich has been added 1 per cent. formalin. Cover the jar and allow the\r\ngelatine to set. When solid, seal the cover of the jar in place.\r\n\r\n7. To seal the museum preparation first warm the glass plate which forms\r\nthe cover. This is most conveniently done by placing the cleaned and\r\npolished cover-plate upon a piece of asbestos millboard over a bunsen\r\nflame turned low.\r\n\r\n8. Smear an even layer of hot cement over the flange of the jar. The\r\ncement is prepared as follows:\r\n\r\nWeigh out and mix in an iron ladle\r\n\r\n    Gutta percha (pure)        4 parts.\r\n    Asphaltum                  5 parts.\r\n\r\nand melt together over a bunsen flame, stirring with an iron rod until\r\nsolution is complete.\r\n\r\n9. Invert the glass plate over the jar and press down firmly into the\r\ncement. Place a piece of asbestos board on the top and on that rest a\r\nsuitable weight until the cement is cold and has thoroughly set.\r\n\r\n10. Trim off any projecting pieces of cement with an old knife, burr\r\nover the joint between jar and cover-plate with a hot smooth piece of\r\nmetal (e. g., the searing iron).\r\n\r\n11. Paint a narrow band of Japan black to finish off, round the joint,\r\noverlapping on to the cover-plate.\r\n\r\n_II. Tube Cultivations of Bacteria._--When showing typical appearances\r\nthese may be preserved, if not permanently, at least for many years, as\r\nmuseum specimens, by the following method:\r\n\r\n1. Take a large glass jar 25 cm. high by 18 cm. diameter, with a firm\r\nbase and a broad flange, carefully ground, around the mouth. The jar\r\nmust be fitted with a disc of plate glass ground on one side, to serve\r\nas a lid.\r\n\r\n2. Smear a thick layer of resin ointment (B.P.) on the flange around the\r\nmouth of the jar.\r\n\r\n3. Cover the bottom of the jar with a layer of cotton-wool and saturate\r\nit with formalin.\r\n\r\n4. Remove the cotton-wool plug from the culture tubes and place them,\r\nmouth upward, inside the jar. (If water of condensation is present in\r\nany of the culture tubes, it should be removed by means of a capillary\r\npipette before placing the tubes in the formalin chamber.)\r\n\r\n5. Adjust the glass disc, ground side downward, over the mouth of the\r\njar and secure it by pressing it firmly down into the ointment, with a\r\nrotary movement.\r\n\r\n6. Remove the tubes from the formalin chamber after the lapse of a week,\r\nand dry the exterior of each.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 202.--Bulloch's tubes.]\r\n\r\n7. Seal the open mouth of each tube in the blowpipe flame and label.\r\n\r\nIf the cultivations are intended for museum purposes when they are first\r\nplanted, it is more convenient to employ Bulloch's tubes. These are\r\nslightly longer than the ordinary tubes, and are provided with a\r\nconstriction some 2 cm. below the mouth (Fig. 202)--a feature which\r\nrenders sealing in the blowpipe flame an easy matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX. THE STUDY OF THE PATHOGENIC BACTERIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe student, who has conscientiously worked out the methods, etc.,\r\npreviously dealt with, is in a position to make accurate observations\r\nand to write precise descriptions of the results of such observations.\r\nHe is, therefore, now entrusted with pure cultivations of the various\r\npathogenic bacteria, in order that he may study the life-history of each\r\nand record the results of his own observations--to be subsequently\r\ncorrected or amplified by the demonstrator. In this way he is rendered\r\nindependent of text-book descriptions, the statements in which he is\r\notherwise too liable to take for granted, without personally attempting\r\nto verify their accuracy.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of this work attention must also be directed, as\r\noccasion arises, to such other bacteria, pathogenic or saprophytic, as\r\nare allied to the particular organisms under observation, or so resemble\r\nthem as to become possible sources of error, by working them through on\r\nparallel lines--in other words the various bacteria should be studied in\r\n\"groups.\" In the following pages the grouping in use in the author's\r\nelementary classes for medical and dental students and for candidates\r\nfor the Public Health service is adopted, since a fairly long experience\r\nhas completely vindicated the value and utility of this arrangement, and\r\nby its means a fund of information is obtained with regard to the\r\nresemblances and differences, morphological and cultural, of a large\r\nnumber of bacteria. The fact that some bacteria appear in more than one\r\nof these groups, so far from being a disadvantage, is a positive gain to\r\nthe student, since with repetition alone will the necessary familiarity\r\nwith the cultural characters of important bacteria be acquired. The\r\nstudy of the various groups will of course vary in detail with\r\nindividual demonstrators, and with the student's requirements--the\r\ngeneral line it should take is indicated briefly in connection with the\r\nfirst group only (pages 410-411). This section should be carefully\r\nworked through before the student proceeds to the study of\r\nbacterioscopical analysis.\r\n\r\nIt is customary to commence the study of the pathogenic bacteria with\r\nthe Organisms of Suppuration. This is a large group, for all the\r\npathogenic bacteria possess the power, under certain conditions, of\r\ninitiating purely pyogenic processes in place of or in addition to their\r\nspecific lesions, (e. g., Bacillus tuberculosis, Streptococcus\r\nlanceolatus, Bacillus typhosus, etc.). There are, however, a certain few\r\norganisms which commonly express their pathogenicity in the formation of\r\npus. These are usually grouped together under the title of \"pyogenic\r\nbacteria,\" as distinct from those which only occasionally exercise a\r\npyogenic role.\r\n\r\nThe organisms included in this group are:\r\n\r\n    1. Staphylococcus pyogenes albus.\r\n    2. Staphylococcus pyogenes aureus.\r\n    3. Staphylococcus pyogenes citreus.\r\n    4. Streptococcus pyogenes longus.\r\n    5. Micrococcus tetragenus.\r\n    6. Bacillus pyocyaneus.\r\n    7. Bacillus pneumoniae.\r\n\r\nand in certain special tissues\r\n\r\n    8. Micrococcus gonorrhoeae.\r\n    9. Micrococcus intracellularis meningitidis (Meningococcus).\r\n    10. Micrococcus catarrhalis.\r\n    11. Bacillus aegypticus (Koch-Weeks Bacillus).\r\n\r\nThe group may with advantage be subdivided as indicated in the following\r\npages:\r\n\r\nI. _Pyogenic cocci._\r\n\r\n    Staphylococcus pyogenes albus.\r\n    Staphylococcus pyogenes aureus.\r\n    Staphylococcus pyogenes citreus.\r\n        to contrast with\r\n    Micrococcus candicans.\r\n    Micrococcus agilis.\r\n\r\n1. Prepare subcultivations from each:\r\n\r\n    Bouillon,         }\r\n    Agar streak,      }\r\n    Blood serum,      }\r\n    Litmus milk.      }  and incubate at 37 deg. C.\r\n    Agar streak,      }\r\n    Gelatine stab,    }\r\n    Potato.           }  and incubate at 20 deg. C.\r\n\r\nCompare the naked-eye appearances of the cultures from day to day. Note\r\nM. agilis refuses to grow at 37 deg. C.\r\n\r\n2. Make hanging-drop preparations from the bouillon and agar\r\ncultivations after twenty-four hours' incubation. Examine\r\nmicroscopically and compare. Note the locomotive activity of M. agilis\r\nand the Brownian movement of the remaining micrococci.\r\n\r\n3. Prepare cover-slip films from the agar cultures, after twenty-four\r\nhours' incubation. Stain for flagella by the modified Pitfield's method.\r\nNote M. agilis is the only micrococcus showing flagella.\r\n\r\n4. Make microscopical preparations of each from all the various media\r\nafter twenty-four and forty-eight hours and three days' incubation.\r\nStain carbolic methylene-blue, carbolic fuchsin, and Gram's method.\r\nExamine the films microscopically and compare. Note in the Gram\r\npreparation, the Gram negative character of certain individual cocci in\r\neach film prepared from the three days' growth--such cocci are dead.\r\n\r\n5.

BACTERIOLOGICAL ANALYSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nEach bacteriological or bacterioscopical analysis of air, earth, sewage,\r\nvarious food-stuffs, etc., includes, as a general rule, two distinct\r\ninvestigations yielding results of very unequal value:\r\n\r\n    1. Quantitative.\r\n    2. Qualitative.\r\n\r\nThe first is purely quantitative and as such is of minor importance as\r\nit aims simply at enumerating (approximately) the total number of\r\nbacteria present in any given unit of volume irrespective of the nature\r\nand character of individual organisms.\r\n\r\nThe second and more important is both qualitative and quantitative in\r\ncharacter since it seeks to accurately identify such pathogenic bacteria\r\nas may be present while, incidentally, the methods advocated are\r\ncalculated to indicate, with a fair degree of accuracy, the numerical\r\nfrequency of such bacteria, in the sample under examination.\r\n\r\nThe general principles underlying the bacteriological analyses of water,\r\nsewage, air and dust, soil, milk, ice cream, meat, and other tinned\r\nstuffs, as exemplified by the methods used by the author, are indicated\r\nin the following pages, together with the methods of testing filters and\r\nchemical germicides; and the technique there set out will be found to be\r\ncapable of expansion and adaptation to any circumstance or set of\r\ncircumstances which may confront the student.\r\n\r\n~Controls.~--The necessity for the existence of adequate controls in all\r\nexperimental work cannot be too urgently insisted upon. Every batch of\r\nplates that is poured should include at least one of the presumably\r\n\"sterile\" medium; plate or tube cultures should be made from the various\r\ndiluting fluids; every tube of carbohydrate medium that is inoculated\r\nshould go into the incubator in company with a similar but uninoculated\r\ntube, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\nBACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF WATER.\r\n\r\nThe bacteria present in the water may comprise not only varieties which\r\nhave their normal habitat in the water and will consequently develop at\r\n20 deg. C., but also if the water has been contaminated with excremental\r\nmatter, varieties which have been derived from, or are pathogenic for,\r\nthe animal body, and which will only develop well at a temperature of\r\n37 deg. C. In order to demonstrate the presence of each of these classes\r\nit will be necessary to incubate the various cultivations at each of these\r\ntemperatures.\r\n\r\nFurther, the sample of water may contain moulds, yeasts, or torulae, and\r\nthe development of these will be best secured by plating in wort\r\ngelatine and incubating at 20 deg. C.\r\n\r\n~1. Quantitative.~--\r\n\r\n_Collection of the Sample._--The most suitable vessels for the reception\r\nof the water sample are small glass bottles, 60 c.c. capacity, with\r\nnarrow necks and overhanging glass stoppers (to prevent contamination of\r\nthe bottle necks by falling dust). These must be carefully sterilised in\r\nthe hot-air steriliser (_vide_ page 31).\r\n\r\n(a) If the sample is obtained from a ~tap~ or ~pipe~, turn on the water\r\nand allow it to run for a few minutes. Remove the stopper from the\r\nbottle and retain it in the hand whilst the water is allowed to run into\r\nthe bottle and three parts fill it. Replace the stopper and tie it down,\r\nbut _do not seal it_.\r\n\r\n(b) If the sample is obtained from a ~stream~, ~tank~, or ~reservoir~,\r\nfasten a piece of stout wire around the neck of the bottle, remove the\r\nstopper, and retain it in the hand. Then, using the wire as a handle,\r\nplunge the bottle into the water, mouth downward, until it is well\r\nbeneath the surface; then reverse it, allow it to fill, and withdraw it\r\nfrom the water. Pour out a few cubic centimetres of water from the\r\nbottle, replace the stopper, and tie it down.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 203.--Esmarch's collecting bottle for water\r\nsamples.]\r\n\r\n(c) If the sample is obtained from a ~lake~, ~river~ or the ~sea~; or when\r\nit is desired to compare samples taken at varying depths, the apparatus\r\ndesigned by v. Esmarch (Fig. 203) is employed. In this the sterilised\r\nbottle is enclosed in a weighted metal cage which can be lowered, by\r\nmeans of a graduated line, until the required depth is reached. At this\r\npoint the bottle is opened by a thin wire cord attached to the stopper;\r\nwhen the bottle is full (as judged by the air bubbles ceasing to rise)\r\nthe pull on the cord is released and the tension of the spiral spring\r\nabove the stopper again forces it into the neck of the bottle. When the\r\napparatus is taken out of the water, the small bottles are filled from\r\nit, and packed in the ice-box mentioned below.\r\n\r\nAn inexpensive substitute for Esmarch's bottle can be made in the\r\nlaboratory thus:\r\n\r\nSelect a wide-mouthed glass stoppered bottle of about 500 c.c. capacity\r\n(about 20 cm. high and 8 cm. in diameter).\r\n\r\nRemove the glass stopper and insert a rubber cork with two perforations\r\nin its place.\r\n\r\nThrough one perforation pass a piece of glass tubing about 5 cm. long\r\nand through the other a piece 22 cm. long, reaching to near the bottom\r\nof the bottle, each tube projecting about 2.5 cm. above the rubber\r\nstopper. Plug the open ends of the tubes with cotton wool. Secure the\r\nstopper in place with thin copper wire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 204.--Thresh's deep water sampling bottle.]\r\n\r\nSterilise the fitted bottle in the autoclave. Remove the cotton wool\r\nplugs and connect the projecting tubes by a piece of loosely fitting\r\nstout rubber pressure tubing about 5 cm. long, previously sterilised by\r\nboiling.\r\n\r\nTake a piece of stout rubber cord about 33 cm. long, and of 10 mm.\r\ndiameter (such as is used for door springs) thread a steel split ring\r\nupon it and secure the free ends tightly to the neck of the bottle by\r\ncord or catgut.\r\n\r\nAttach the cord used for lowering the bottle into the water to the split\r\nring on the rubber suspender. The best material for this purpose is\r\ncotton insulated electric wire knotted at every metre.\r\n\r\nConnect the split ring also with the short piece of rubber tubing\r\nuniting the two glass tubes by a piece of catgut (or thin copper wire)\r\nof such length that when the bottle is suspended there is no pull upon\r\nthe rubber tube, but which, however, will be easily jerked off when a\r\nsharp pull is given to the suspending cord.\r\n\r\nNow wind heavy lead tubing about 1 cm. diameter around the upper part of\r\nthe bottle, starting at the neck just above the shoulder. This ensures\r\nthe sinking of the bottle in the vertical position (Fig. 204).\r\n\r\nThe apparatus being arranged is lowered to the required depth, a sharp\r\njerk is then given to the suspending cord, which detaches the rubber\r\ntube and so opens the two glass tubes. Water enters through the longer\r\ntube and the air is expelled through the shorter tube. The bubbles of\r\nair can be seen or heard rising through the water, until the bottle is\r\nnearly full, a small volume of compressed air remaining in the neck of\r\nthe bottle.\r\n\r\nAs the apparatus is raised, the air thus imprisoned expands, and\r\nprevents the entry of more water from nearer the surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 205.--Ice-box for transmission of water samples,\r\netc.]\r\n\r\n_Transport of Sample._--If the examination of the sample cannot be\r\ncommenced immediately, steps must be taken to prevent the multiplication\r\nof the bacteria contained in the water during the interval occupied in\r\ntransit from the place of collection to the laboratory. To this end an\r\nice-box such as that shown (in Fig. 205) is essential. It consists of a\r\ndouble-walled metal cylinder into which slides a cylindrical chamber of\r\nsufficient capacity to accommodate four of the 60 c.c. bottles; this in\r\nturn is covered by a metal disc--the three portions being bolted\r\ntogether by thumb screws through the overhanging flanges. When in use,\r\nplace the bottles, rolled in cotton-wool, in the central chamber, pack\r\nthe space between the walls with pounded ice, securely close the metal\r\nbox by screwing down the fly nuts, and place it in a felt-lined wooden\r\ncase. (It has been shown that whilst bacteria will survive exposure to\r\nthe temperature of melting ice, practically none will multiply at this\r\ntemperature.)\r\n\r\nOn reaching the laboratory, the method of examination consists in adding\r\nmeasured quantities of the water sample to several tubes of nutrient\r\nmedia previously liquefied by heat, pouring plate cultivations from each\r\nof these tubes, incubating at a suitable temperature, and finally\r\ncounting the colonies which make their appearance on the plates.\r\n\r\n_Apparatus Required_:\r\n\r\n    Plate-levelling stand.\r\n    Case of sterile plates.\r\n    Case of sterile pipettes, 1 c.c. (in tenths of a cubic centimetre).\r\n    Case of sterile pipettes, 10 c.c. (in tenths of a cubic centimetre).\r\n    Case of sterile capsules, 25 c.c. capacity.\r\n    Tubes of nutrient gelatine.\r\n    Tubes of nutrient agar.\r\n    Tubes of wort gelatine.\r\n    One 250 c.c. flask of sterile distilled water.\r\n    Tall cylinder containing 2 per cent. lysol solution.\r\n    Bunsen burner.\r\n    Grease pencil.\r\n    Water-bath regulated at 42 deg. C.\r\n\r\nMETHOD.--\r\n\r\n1. Arrange the plate-levelling platform with its water compartment\r\nfilled with water, at 45 deg. C.\r\n\r\n2. Number the agar tubes, consecutively, 1 to 6; the gelatine tubes,\r\nconsecutively, 1 to 6, and the wort tubes, 1, 2, and 3. Flame the plugs\r\nand see that they are not adherent to the lips of the tubes.\r\n\r\n3. Place the agar tubes in boiling water until the medium is melted,\r\nthen transfer them to the water-bath regulated at 42 deg. C. Liquefy the\r\nnutrient gelatine and wort gelatine tubes by immersing them in the same\r\nwater-bath.\r\n\r\n4. Remove the bottle containing the water sample from the ice-box,\r\ndistribute the bacterial contents evenly throughout the water by\r\nshaking, cut the string securing the stopper, and loosen the stopper,\r\nbut do not take it out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 206.--Withdrawing water from water sample bottle.]\r\n\r\n5. Remove one of the 1 c.c. pipettes from the case, holding it by the\r\nplain portion of the tube. Pass the graduated portion twice through the\r\nBunsen flame. Tilt the bottle containing the water sample on the bench\r\nholding the neck between the middle and ring fingers of the left hand;\r\ngrasp the head of the stopper between the forefinger and thumb, and\r\nremove it from the bottle.\r\n\r\n6. Pass the pipette into the mouth of the bottle, holding its point well\r\nbelow the surface of the water (Fig. 206). Suck up rather more than 1\r\nc.c. into the pipette and allow the pipette to empty; this moistens the\r\ninterior of the pipette and renders accurate measurement possible. Now\r\ndraw up exactly 1 c.c. into the pipette. Withdraw the pipette from the\r\nbottle, replace the stopper, and stand the bottle upright.\r\n\r\n7. Take the first melted agar tube in the left hand, remove the\r\ncotton-wool plug, and add to its contents 0.5 c.c. of the water sample\r\nfrom the pipette; replug the tube and replace it in the water-bath. In a\r\nsimilar manner add 0.3 c.c. water to the contents of the second tube,\r\nand 0.2 c.c. to the contents of the third.\r\n\r\n8. In a similar manner add 1 c.c. of the sample to the contents of the\r\nfourth tube.\r\n\r\n9. Similarly, add 0.5 c.c. and 0.1 c.c. respectively to the contents of\r\nthe fifth and sixth tubes.\r\n\r\n10. Drop the pipette into the cylinder containing lysol solution.\r\n\r\n11. Mix the water sample with the medium in each tube in the manner\r\ndescribed under plate cultivations; pour a plate from each tube. Label\r\neach plate with (a) the distinctive number of the sample, (b) the\r\nquantity of water sample it contains, and (c) the date.\r\n\r\n12. Pour the contents of a tube of liquefied agar--not inoculated--into\r\na Petri dish to act as a control to demonstrate the sterility of the\r\nbatch of agar employed.\r\n\r\n13. Allow the plates to set, and incubate at 37 deg. C.\r\n\r\n14. Empty the water chamber of the levelling apparatus and refill it\r\nwith ice-water.\r\n\r\n15. By means of the sterile 10 c.c. pipette deliver 9.9 c.c. sterile\r\ndistilled water into a sterile glass capsule.\r\n\r\n16. Add 0.1 c.c. of the water sample to the 9.9 c.c. sterile water in\r\nthe capsule. This will give a dilution of 1 in 100.\r\n\r\n17. Plant the six tubes of nutrient gelatine in the following manner: To\r\nthe first tube add 0.5 c.c. of the water sample direct from the bottle;\r\nto the second, 0.3 c.c.; and to the third, 0.2 c.c.; and pour a plate of\r\neach tube. To the fourth tube add 0.5 c.c. of the diluted water sample\r\nfrom the capsule; to the fifth, 0.3 c.c.; and to the sixth, 0.2 c.c.;\r\nand pour a plate from each.\r\n\r\n18. Label each plate with the quantity of the water sample it\r\ncontains--that is, 0.5 c.c., 0.3 c.c., 0.2 c.c., 0.005 c.c., 0.003 c.c.,\r\nand 0.002 c.c.\r\n\r\n19. Pour a control (uninoculated) gelatine plate.\r\n\r\n20. Allow the plates to set, and incubate at 20 deg. C.\r\n\r\n21. To the first tube of liquefied wort gelatine add 0.5 c.c. water\r\nsample; to the second, 0.3 c.c.; and to the third, 0.2 c.c.\r\n\r\n22. Label the plates, allow them to set, and incubate at 20 deg. C.\r\n\r\n23. Count and record the number of colonies that have developed upon the\r\nagar at 37 deg. C. after forty-eight hours' incubation.\r\n\r\n24. Note the number of colonies present on each of the gelatine and wort\r\ngelatine plates after forty-eight hours' incubation.\r\n\r\n25. Replace the gelatine and wort plates in the incubator; observe again\r\nat three days, four days, and five days.\r\n\r\n26. Calculate and record the number of organisms present per cubic\r\ncentimetre of the original water from the average of the six gelatine\r\nplates at the latest date possible up to seven days--the presence of\r\nliquefying bacteria may render the calculation necessary at an earlier\r\ndate, hence the importance of daily observations.\r\n\r\n_Method of Counting._--The most accurate method of counting the colonies\r\non each of the plates is by means of either Jeffery's or Pakes' counting\r\ndisc. Each of these discs consists of a piece of paper, upon which is\r\nprinted a dead black disc, subdivided by concentric circles and radii,\r\nprinted in white. In Jeffery's counter (Fig. 207), each subdivision has\r\nan area of 1 square centimetre; in Pakes' counter (Fig. 208), radii\r\ndivide the circle into sixteen equal sectors, and counting is\r\nfacilitated by concentric circles equidistant from the centre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 207.--Jeffery's disc, reduced.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 208.--Pakes' disc, reduced.]\r\n\r\n(a) In the final counting of each plate, place the plate over the\r\ncounting disc, and centre it, if possible, making its periphery coincide\r\nwith one or other of the concentric circles.\r\n\r\n(b) Remove the cover of the plate, and by means of a hand lens count the\r\ncolonies appearing in each of the sectors in turn. Make a note of the\r\nnumber present in each.\r\n\r\n(c) If the colonies present are fewer than 500, the entire plate should\r\nbe counted. If, however, they exceed this number, enumerate one-half, or\r\none-quarter of the plate, or count a sector here and there, and from\r\nthese figures estimate the number of colonies present on the entire\r\nplate. In practice it will be found that Pakes' disc is more suitable\r\nfor the former class of plate; Jeffery's disc for the latter. It should\r\nbe recollected however that unless the plates have been carefully\r\nleveled and the medium is of equal thickness all over it is useless to\r\ntry and average from small areas--since where the medium is thick all\r\nthe bacteria will develop, where the layer is a thin one, only a few\r\nbacteria will find sufficient pabulum for the production of visible\r\ncolonies.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that the quantities of water selected for addition to\r\neach set of tubes of nutrient media have been carefully chosen in order\r\nto yield workable results even when dealing with widely differing\r\nsamples. Plates prepared in agar with 0.1 c.c. and in gelatin with 0.02\r\nc.c. can be counted even when large numbers of bacteria are present in\r\nthe sample; whereas if micro-organisms are relatively few, agar plate 4\r\nand gelatine plate 1 will give the most reliable counts. Again the\r\ncounts of the plates in a measure control each other; for example, the\r\nsecond and third plates of each gelatine series should together contain\r\nas many colonies as the first, and the second should contain about half\r\nas many more than the third and so on.\r\n\r\n2. Qualitative Examination.--\r\n\r\n_Collection of Sample._--The water sample required for the routine\r\nexamination, which it will be convenient to consider first, amounts to\r\nabout 110 c.c. It is collected in the manner previously described\r\n(_vide_ page 416); similar bottles are used, and if four are filled the\r\ncombined contents, amounting to about 240 c.c., will provide ample\r\nmaterial for both the qualitative and quantitative examinations. Unless\r\nthe examination is to be commenced at once, the ice-box must be\r\nemployed, otherwise water bacteria and other saprophytes will probably\r\nmultiply at the expense of the microbes indicative of pollution, and so\r\nincrease the difficulties of the investigation.\r\n\r\nIn the routine examination of water supplies it is customary to limit\r\nthe qualitative examination to a search for\r\n\r\nA. B. coli and its near allies.\r\n\r\nB. Streptococci,\r\n\r\norganisms which are frequently spoken of as microbes of indication, as\r\ntheir presence is held to be evidence of pollution of the water by\r\nmaterial derived from the mammalian alimentary canal, and so to\r\nconstitute a danger signal.\r\n\r\nC. Some observers still attach importance to the presence of B.\r\nenteritidis sporogenes, but as the search for this bacterium,\r\n(relatively scarce in water) necessitates the collection of a fairly\r\nlarge quantity of water it is not usually included in the routine\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nIn the case of water samples examined during the progress of an\r\nepidemic, of new supplies and of unknown waters the search is extended\r\nto embrace other members of the coli-typhoid group; and on occasion the\r\nquestion of the presence or absence of Vibrio cholerae or (more rarely)\r\nsuch bacteria as B. anthracis or B. tetani, may need investigation.\r\n\r\nWhen pathogenic or excremental bacteria are present in water, their\r\nnumbers are relatively few, owing to the dilution they have undergone,\r\nand it is usual in commencing the examination, to adopt one or other of\r\nthe following methods:\r\n\r\nA. _Enrichment_, in which the harmless non-pathogenic bacteria may be\r\ndestroyed or their growth inhibited, whilst the growth of the parasitic\r\nbacteria is encouraged.\r\n\r\nThis is attained by so arranging the environment, (i. e., Media,\r\nincubation temperature, and atmosphere) as to favor the growth of the\r\npathogenic organisms at the expense of the harmless saprophytes.\r\n\r\nB. _Concentration_, whereby all the bacteria present in the sample of\r\nwater, pathogenic or otherwise, are concentrated in a small bulk of\r\nfluid.\r\n\r\nThis is usually effected by filtration of the water sample through a\r\nporcelain filter candle, and the subsequent emulsion of the bacterial\r\nresidue remaining on the walls of the candle with a small measured\r\nquantity of sterile bouillon.\r\n\r\nA. ~Enrichment Method.~\r\n\r\n(Dealing with the demonstration of bacteria of intestinal origin.)\r\n\r\n_Apparatus Required_ (_Preliminary Stage_):\r\n\r\n    Incubator running at 42 deg.

C.\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--The bile salt medium is particularly suitable for the\r\n     cultivation of bacteria of intestinal origin, and at the\r\n     same time inhibits the growth of bacteria derived from other\r\n     sources.\r\n\r\nThe anaerobic conditions likewise favor the multiplication of intestinal\r\nbacteria, and also their fermentative activity. The temperature 42 deg. C.\r\ndestroys ordinary water bacteria and inhibits the growth of many\r\nordinary mesophilic bacteria.\r\n\r\n5. Pipette 25 c.c. of double strength bile salt broth into flask 6, and\r\n50 c.c. double strength bile salt broth into flask 7.\r\n\r\n6. Pipette 25 c.c. water sample into flask 6, and 50 c.c. water sample\r\ninto flask 7.\r\n\r\n7. Incubate the two flasks aerobically at 42 deg. C.\r\n\r\n8. After twenty-four hours incubation note in each culture:\r\n\r\na. The presence or absence of visible growth.\r\n\r\nb. The reaction of the medium as indicated by the colour change, if\r\nany, the litmus has undergone.\r\n\r\nc. The presence or absence of gas formation, as indicated by a froth\r\non the surface of the medium, and the collection of gas in the inner\r\n\"gas\" tube.\r\n\r\n9. Replace those tubes which show no signs of growth in the incubator.\r\nExamine after another period of twenty-four hours (total forty-eight\r\nhours incubation) with reference to the same points.\r\n\r\n10. Remove culture tubes which show visible growth from the Buchner's\r\ntubes, whether acid production and gas formation are present or not.\r\n\r\n11. Examine all tubes which show growth by hanging-drop preparations.\r\nNote such as show the presence of chains of cocci.\r\n\r\n12. Prepare surface plate cultivations upon nutrose agar from each tube\r\nthat shows growth either macroscopically or microscopically, and\r\nincubate for twenty-four hours aerobically at 37 deg. C.\r\n\r\n13. Examine the growth on the plates either with the naked eye or with\r\nthe help of a small hand lens. Practice will facilitate the recognition\r\nof colonies of the coli group, the typhoid group and the paratyphoid\r\ngroup; also those due to the growth of streptococci. The investigation\r\nfrom this stage proceeds along two divergent lines of enquiry--the first\r\nbeing concerned with the identity of the bacilli--typhoid bacilli, the\r\nsecond with that of the cocci.\r\n\r\nA. _B. Coli and its allies._\r\n\r\n14. Pick off coliform or typhiform colonies; make streak or smear\r\nsubcultivations upon nutrient agar; incubate aerobically for twenty-four\r\nhours at 37 deg. C.\r\n\r\n15. Examine the growth in each tube carefully both macroscopically and\r\nmicroscopically. If the growth is impure, replate on nutrose agar, pick\r\noff colonies and subcultivate again. When the growth in a tube is pure,\r\nadd 5 c.c. sterile normal saline solution or sterile broth, and emulsify\r\nthe entire surface growth with it.\r\n\r\n16. Utilise the emulsion for the preparation of a series of\r\nsubcultivations upon the media enumerated below, using the ordinary loop\r\nto make the subcultures upon solid media, but adding one-tenth of a\r\ncubic centimetre of the emulsion to each of the fluid media by means of\r\na sterile pipette.\r\n\r\n    Gelatine streak.\r\n    Agar streak.\r\n    Potato.\r\n    Nutrient broth.\r\n    Litmus milk.\r\n    Dextrose peptone solution.\r\n    Laevulose peptone solution.\r\n    Galactose peptone solution.\r\n    Maltose peptone solution.\r\n    Lactose peptone solution.\r\n    Saccharose peptone solution.\r\n    Raffinose peptone solution.\r\n    Dulcite peptone solution.\r\n    Mannite peptone solution.\r\n    Glycerin peptone solution.\r\n    Inulin peptone solution.\r\n    Dextrin peptone solution.\r\n\r\n17. Differentiate the bacilli after isolation by means of their cultural\r\nreactions and biological characters into members of:\r\n\r\nI. The Escherich Group.\r\n\r\n    B. coli communis.\r\n    B. coli communior.\r\n    B. lactis aerogenes.\r\n    B. cloacae.\r\n\r\nII. The Gaertner Group.\r\n\r\n    Bacillus enteritidis (of Gaertner).\r\n    B. paratyphosus A.\r\n    B. paratyphosus B.\r\n    Bacillus cholerae suum.\r\n\r\nIII. The Eberth Group.\r\n\r\n    B. typhosus.\r\n    B. dysenteriae (Shiga).\r\n    B. dysenteriae (Flexner).\r\n    B. faecalis alcaligines.\r\n\r\n18. Confirm these results by testing the organisms isolated against\r\nspecific agglutinating sera obtained from experimentally inoculated\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nIf a positive result is obtained when using this method, it only needs a\r\nsimple calculation to determine the smallest quantity (down to 0.1 c.c.)\r\nof the sample that contains at least one of the microbes of indication.\r\nFor instance, if growth occurs in all the tubes from 4 to 10, and that\r\ngrowth is subsequently proved to be due to the multiplication of B.\r\ncoli, then it follows that at least one colon bacillus is present in\r\nevery 10 c.c. of the water sample, but not in every 5 c.c. If, on the\r\nother hand, the presence of the B. coli can only be proved in flask No.\r\n7, then the average number of colon bacilli present in the sample is at\r\nleast one in every 50 c.c. (i. e., twenty per litre), but not one in\r\nevery 25 c.c. and so on.\r\n\r\nThe general outline of the method of identifying the members of the\r\ncoli-typhoid group is given in the form of an analytical schema--whilst\r\nthe full differential details are set out in tabular form.\r\n\r\nANALYTICAL SCHEME FOR ISOLATION OF MEMBERS OF THE COLI AND TYPHOID\r\nGROUPS.\r\n\r\n                           Nutrose agar.\r\n                                  |\r\n               -----------------------------------\r\n               |                                  |\r\n         Red colonies.

The method of collecting the sample is identical\r\nwith that described under the heading of Quantitative Examination; there\r\nis, however, not the same imperative necessity to pack the sample in ice\r\nfor transmission to the laboratory.\r\n\r\n_Apparatus required_:\r\n\r\n     Sterile Chamberland or Doulton \"white\" porcelain open mouth\r\n     filter candle, fitted with rubber washer.\r\n\r\n     Rubber cork to fit mouth of the filter candle, perforated\r\n     with one hole.\r\n\r\n     Kitasato serum flask, 2500 c.c. capacity.\r\n\r\n     Geryk air pump or water force pump.\r\n\r\n     Wulff's bottle, fitted as wash-bottle, and containing\r\n     sulphuric acid (to act as a safety valve between filter and\r\n     pump).\r\n\r\n     Pressure tubing, clamps, pinch-cock.\r\n\r\n     Retort stand, with ring and clamp.\r\n\r\n     Rubber cork for the neck of Winchester quart, perforated\r\n     with two holes and fitted with one 6 cm. length of straight\r\n     glass tubing, and one V-shaped piece of glass tubing, one\r\n     arm 32 cm. in length, the other 52 cm., the shorter arm\r\n     being plugged with cotton-wool. The rubber stopper must be\r\n     sterilised by boiling and the glass tubing by hot air,\r\n     before use.\r\n\r\n     Flask containing 250 c.c. sterile broth.\r\n\r\n     Test-tube brush to fit the lumen of the candle, enclosed in\r\n     a sterile test-tube (and previously sterilised by dry heat\r\n     or by boiling).\r\n\r\n     Case of sterile pipettes, 10 c.c. in tenths.\r\n\r\n     Case of sterile pipettes, 1 c.c. in tenths.\r\n\r\n     Case of sterile pipettes, 1 c.c. in hundredths.\r\n\r\n     Tubes of various nutrient media (according to requirements).\r\n\r\n     Twelve Buchner's tubes with rubber stoppers.\r\n\r\n     Pyrogallic acid tablets.\r\n\r\n     Caustic soda tablets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sample form]]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 209.--Water filtering apparatus. That portion of the\r\nfigure to the left of the vertical line is drawn to a larger scale than\r\nthat on the right, in order to show details of Sprengel's pump.]\r\n\r\nMETHOD.--\r\n\r\n1. Fit up the filtering apparatus as in the accompanying diagram (Fig.\r\n209), interposing the wash-bottle with sulphuric acid between the\r\nfilter flask and the force-pump (in the position occupied in the diagram\r\nby the central vertical line), and placing another screw clamp on the\r\nrubber tubing connecting the lateral arm of the filter flask with the\r\nwash-bottle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 210. Sterile test-tube brush.]\r\n\r\n2. Filter the entire 2000 c.c. of water through the filter candle.\r\n\r\n3. When the nitration is completed, screw up the clamps and so occlude\r\nthe two pieces of pressure tubing.\r\n\r\n4. Reverse the position of the glass tubes in the Wulff's bottle so that\r\nthe one nearest the air pump now dips into the sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\n5. Slowly open the metal clamps and allow air to gradually pass through\r\nthe acid, and enter filter flask, and so restore the pressure.\r\n\r\n6. Unship the apparatus, remove the cork from the mouth of the candle.\r\n\r\n7. Pipette 10 c.c. of sterile broth into the interior of the candle, and\r\nby means of the sterile test-tube brush (Fig. 210) emulsify the slimy\r\nresidue which lines the candle, with the broth.\r\n\r\nPractically all the bacteria contained in the original 2000 c.c. of\r\nwater are now suspended in 10 c.c. of broth, so that 1 c.c. of the\r\nsuspension is equivalent, so far as the contained organisms are\r\nconcerned, to 200 c.c. of the original water. (Some bacteria will of\r\ncourse be left behind on the walls of the filter and in its pores.)\r\n\r\nUp to this point the method is identical, irrespective of the particular\r\norganism whose presence it is desired to demonstrate; but from this\r\npoint onward the methods must be specially adapted to the isolation of\r\ndefinite groups of organisms or of individual bacteria.\r\n\r\nThe Coli-Typhoid Group.--\r\n\r\n1. Number nine tubes of bile salt broth (_vide_ page 180), consecutively\r\nfrom 1 to 9.\r\n\r\n2. To No 1 add 1 c.c. } of the original water sample\r\n         2 add 2 c.c. } before the nitration is commenced.\r\n         3 add 5 c.c. }\r\n\r\n3. To the remaining tubes of bile salt broth add varying quantities of\r\nthe suspension by means of suitably graduated sterile pipettes, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nNo. 4   0.05  c.c. (equivalent to  10 c.c. of the original water sample).\r\nNo. 5   0.125 c.c. (equivalent to  25 c.c. of the original water sample).\r\nNo. 6   0.25  c.c. (equivalent to  50 c.c. of the original water sample).\r\nNo. 7   0.5   c.c. (equivalent to 100 c.c. of the original water sample).\r\nNo. 8   1.0   c.c. (equivalent to 200 c.c. of the original water sample).\r\nNo. 9   2.5   c.c. (equivalent to 500 c.c. of the original water sample).\r\n\r\n4. Put up each tube anaerobically in a Buchner's tube and incubate at\r\n42 deg. C.\r\n\r\n5. The subsequent steps are identical with those described under the\r\nEnrichment method (see page 428 to 431; Steps 8 to 18).\r\n\r\n     _Alternative Methods._--\r\n\r\n     A few of the older methods for the isolation of the members\r\n     of the coli-typhoid groups are referred to but they are\r\n     distinctly inferior to those already described.\r\n\r\n     (A) The Carbolic Method:\r\n\r\n     1. Take ten tubes of carbolised bouillon (_vide_ page 202)\r\n     and number them consecutively from 1 to 10.\r\n\r\n     2. Inoculate each tube with a different amount of the water\r\n     sample or suspension, as in the previous method.\r\n\r\n     3. Incubate aerobically at 37 deg. C.\r\n\r\n     4. Examine the culture tubes after twenty-four hours'\r\n     incubation.\r\n\r\n     5. From those tubes which shows signs of growth, pour plates\r\n     in the usual manner, using carbolised gelatine (_vide_ page\r\n     202) in place of the ordinary gelatine, and incubate at 20 deg.\r\n     C. for three, four, or five days as may be necessary.\r\n\r\n     6. Subcultivate from any colonies that make their\r\n     appearance, and determine their identity on the lines laid\r\n     down in the previous method.\r\n\r\n     (B) Parietti's Method:\r\n\r\n     1. Take nine tubes of Parietti's bouillon (_vide_ page\r\n     202)--i. e., three each of those containing 0.1 c.c., 0.2\r\n     c.c., and 0.5 c.c. of Parietti's solution respectively.\r\n     Mark plainly on the outside of each tube the quantity of\r\n     Parietti's solution it contains.\r\n\r\n     2. To each tube add a different amount of the original\r\n     water, or of the suspension, and incubate at 37 deg. C.\r\n\r\n     3. Examine the culture tubes after twenty-four and\r\n     forty-eight hours' incubation, and plate in nutrient\r\n     carbolised or potato gelatine from such as have grown.\r\n\r\n     4. Pick off suspicious colonies, if any such appear on the\r\n     plates, subcultivate them upon the various media, and\r\n     identify them.\r\n\r\n     (C) Elsner's Method: This method simply consists in\r\n     substituting Elsner's potato gelatine (_vide_ page 204) for\r\n     ordinary nutrient gelatine in any of the previously\r\n     mentioned methods.\r\n\r\n     (D) Cambier's Candle Method:\r\n\r\n     Treat a large volume of the water sample by the\r\n     concentration method (_vide_ page 434).\r\n\r\n     1. Remove the rubber stopper from the mouth of the filter\r\n     candle, introduce 10 c.c. sterile bouillon into its\r\n     interior, and emulsify the bacterial sediment; replug the\r\n     mouth of the candle with a wad of sterile cotton-wool.\r\n\r\n     2. Remove the filter candle from the filter flask and insert\r\n     it into the mouth of a flask or a glass cylinder containing\r\n     sterile bouillon sufficient to reach nearly up to the rubber\r\n     washer on the candle.\r\n\r\n     3. Incubate for twenty-four to thirty-six hours at 37 deg. C.\r\n\r\n     4. From the now turbid bouillon in the glass cylinder pour\r\n     gelatine plates and incubate at 20 deg. C.\r\n\r\n     5. Subcultivate and identify any suspicious colonies that\r\n     appear.\r\n\r\n     (The method depends upon the assumption that members of the\r\n     typhoid and coli groups find their way through the porcelain\r\n     filter from the interior to the surrounding bouillon at a\r\n     quicker rate than the associated bacteria.)\r\n\r\n\r\nB. ~Enteritidis Sporogenes.~--\r\n\r\n1. Transfer 5 c.c. of the emulsion from the filter candle to a sterile\r\ntest-tube and plug carefully.\r\n\r\n2. Place the test-tube in the interior of the benzole bath employed in\r\nseparating out spore-bearing organisms (_vide_ page 257), and expose to\r\na temperature of 80 deg. C. for twenty minutes.\r\n\r\n3. Number ten tubes of litmus milk consecutively from 1 to 10.\r\n\r\n4. Remove the test-tube from the benzole bath and shake well to\r\ndistribute the spores evenly through the fluid.\r\n\r\n5. To each tube of litmus milk add a measured quantity of the suspension\r\ncorresponding to the amounts employed in isolating the coli group\r\n(_vide_ page 437).\r\n\r\n6. Incubate each tube anaerobically at 37 deg. C. Anaerobic conditions\r\ncan be obtained by putting the cultures up in Buchner's tubes or in\r\nBulloch's apparatus. If, however, whole milk has been used in making the\r\nlitmus milk the layer of cream that rises to the surface will be\r\nsufficient to ensure anaerobiosis; whilst if separated milk has been\r\nemployed it will be sufficient to pour a layer of sterile vaseline or\r\nliquid paraffin on the surface of the fluid.\r\n\r\n7. Examine after twenty-four hours' incubation. Note (if B. enteritidis\r\nsporogenes is present)--\r\n\r\n(a) Acid reaction of the medium as indicated by the colour of the\r\nlitmus or its complete decolourisation.\r\n\r\n(b) Presence of clotting, and the separation of clear whey.\r\n\r\n(c) Presence of gas, as indicated by fissures and bubbles in the\r\ncoagulum, and possibly masses of coagulum driven up the tube almost to\r\nthe plug.\r\n\r\n8. Replace the tubes which show no signs of growth in the incubator for\r\na further period of twenty-four hours and again examine with reference\r\nto the same points.\r\n\r\n9. Remove those tubes which give evidence of growth from the Buchner's\r\ntubes and carefully pipette off the whey; examine the whey\r\nmicroscopically.\r\n\r\n10. Inoculate two guinea-pigs each subcutaneously with 0.5 c.c. of the\r\nwhey and observe the result.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Vibrio Cholerae.~--\r\n\r\n1. Number ten tubes of peptone water consecutively from 1 to 10.\r\n\r\n2. To each of the tubes of peptone water add a measured quantity of the\r\nsuspension, corresponding to those amounts employed in isolating the\r\nmembers of the coli group (_vide_ page 437).\r\n\r\n3. Incubate aerobically at 37 deg. C. for twenty-four hours. Examine\r\nthe tubes carefully for visible growth, especially delicate pellicle\r\nformation, which if present should be examined microscopically for\r\nvibrios, both by stained preparations or by fresh specimens with dark\r\nground illumination.\r\n\r\n4. Inoculate fresh tubes of peptone water from such of the tubes as\r\nexhibit pellicle formation--from the pellicle itself--and incubate at\r\n37 deg. C. for twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n5. Test the peptone water itself for the presence of indol and nitrite\r\nby the addition of pure concentrated H_{2}SO_{4}.\r\n\r\n5. Prepare gelatine and agar plates in the usual way from such of these\r\ntubes as show pellicle formation.\r\n\r\n6. Pick off from the plates any colonies resembling those of the Vibrio\r\ncholerae and subcultivate upon all the ordinary laboratory media.\r\n\r\n7. Test the vibrio isolated against the serum of an animal immunised to\r\nthe Vibrio cholerae for agglutination.\r\n\r\n\r\n~B. Anthracis.~--\r\n\r\n1. Transfer 5 c.c. of the emulsion from the filter candle to a sterile\r\ntest-tube and plug carefully.\r\n\r\n2. Place the test-tube in the interior of the benzole bath employed in\r\nseparating out spore-bearing organisms (_vide_ page 257), and expose to\r\na temperature of 80 deg. C. for twenty minutes.\r\n\r\n3. Inoculate a _young_ white rat subcutaneously (on the inner aspect of\r\none of the hind legs) with 1 c.c. of the emulsion. Observe during life,\r\nand, if the animal succumbs, make a complete post-mortem examination.\r\n\r\n4. Melt three tubes of nutrient agar in boiling water and cool to 42\r\ndeg. C.\r\n\r\n5. Number the tubes 1, 2, and 3. To No. 1 add 0.2 c.c., to No. 2 add 0.3\r\nc.c., and to No. 3 add 0.5 c.c. of the suspension, and pour plates\r\ntherefrom.\r\n\r\n6. Incubate at 37 deg. C. for twenty-four or forty-eight hours.\r\n\r\n7. Pick off any colonies resembling those of anthrax and subcultivate on\r\nall the ordinary laboratory media.\r\n\r\n8. Inoculate another young white rat as in 3, using two loopfuls of the\r\nagar subcultivation emulsified with 1 c.c. sterile bouillon. Observe\r\nduring life, and if the animal succumbs, make a complete post-mortem\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\n\r\n~B. Tetani.~--\r\n\r\n1. Proceed as detailed above in steps 1 and 2 for the isolation of the\r\nB. anthracis.\r\n\r\n2. Add 1 c.c. of the suspension to each of three tubes of glucose\r\nformate broth, and incubate anaerobically in Buchner's tubes at 37 deg. C.\r\n\r\n3. From such of the tubes as show visible growth (with or without the\r\nproduction of gas) after twenty-four hours' incubation inoculate\r\nguinea-pigs, subcutaneously (under the skin of the abdomen), using 0.1\r\nc.c. of the bouillon cultivation as a dose. Observe carefully during\r\nlife, and, if death occurs, make a complete post-mortem examination.\r\n\r\n4. From the same tubes pour agar plates and incubate anaerobically in\r\nBulloch's apparatus, at 37 deg. C.\r\n\r\n5. Subcultivate suspicious colonies on the various media, incubate\r\nanaerobically, making control cultivations on glucose formate agar, stab\r\nand streak, to incubate aerobically and carry out further inoculation\r\nexperiments with the resulting growths.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMINATION OF MILK.\r\n\r\n\"One-cow\" or \"whole\" milk, if taken from the apparently healthy animal\r\n(that is, an animal without any obvious lesion of the udder or teats)\r\nwith ordinary precautions as to cleanliness, avoidance of dust, etc.,\r\ncontains but few organisms. In dealing with one-cow milk, from a\r\nsuspected, or an obviously diseased animal, a complete analysis should\r\ninclude the examination (both qualitative and quantitative) of samples\r\nof (a) fore-milk, (b) mid-milk, (c) strippings, and, if possible,\r\nfrom each quarter of the udder. \"Mixed\" milk, on the other hand, by the\r\ntime it leaves the retailer's hands, usually contains as many\r\nmicro-organisms as an equal volume of sewage and indeed during the\r\nexamination it is treated as such.\r\n\r\nIt is possible however to collect and store mixed milk in so cleanly a\r\nmanner that its germ content does not exceed 5000 micro-organisms per\r\ncubic centimetre. Such comparative freedom from extraneous bacteria is\r\nusually secured by the purveyor only when he resorts to the process of\r\npasteurisation (heating the milk to 65 deg. C. for twenty minutes or to\r\n77 deg. C. for one minute) or the simpler plan of adding preservatives to\r\nthe milk. Information regarding the employment of these methods for the\r\ndestruction of bacteria should always be sought in the case of mixed\r\nmilk samples, and in this connection the following tests will be found\r\nuseful:\r\n\r\n1. _Raw Milk_ (Saul).\r\n\r\nTo 10 c.c. milk in a test tube, add 1 c.c. of a 1 per cent. aqueous\r\nsolution of ortol (ortho-methyl-amino-phenol sulphate), recently\r\nprepared and mix. Next add 0.2 c.c. of a 3 per cent. peroxide of\r\nhydrogen solution. The appearance of a brick red color within 30 seconds\r\nindicates raw milk. Milk heated to 74 deg. C. for thirty minutes undergoes\r\nno alteration in color; if heated to 75 deg. C. for ten minutes only, the\r\nbrick red color appears after standing for about two minutes.\r\n\r\n2. _Boric Acid._\r\n\r\nEvaporate to dryness, 50 c.c. of the milk which has been rendered\r\nslightly alkaline to litmus, then incinerate.\r\n\r\nDissolve in distilled water, add slight excess of dilute hydrochloric\r\nacid and again evaporate to dryness.\r\n\r\nDissolve the residue in a small quantity of hot water and moisten a\r\npiece of turmeric paper with the solution. Dry the turmeric paper.\r\n_Rose_ or _cherry-red_ color = borax or boric acid.\r\n\r\n3. _Formaldehyde_ (Hehner).\r\n\r\nTo 10 c.c. milk in a test tube add 5 c.c. concentrated _commercial_\r\nsulphuric acid slowly, so that the two fluids do not mix. Hold the tube\r\nvertically and agitate very gently. _Violet zone_ at the junction of the\r\ntwo liquids = formaldehyde.\r\n\r\n4. _Hydrogen Peroxide._\r\n\r\nTo 10 c.c. milk (diluted with equal quantities of water) in a test tube\r\nadd 0.4 c.c. of a 4 per cent. alcoholic solution of benzidine and 0.2\r\nc.c. acetic acid. _Blue coloration_ of the mixture = hydrogen peroxide.\r\n\r\n5. _Salicylic Acid._\r\n\r\nPrecipitate the caseinogen by the addition of acetic acid and filter. To\r\nthe filtrate add a few drops of 1 per cent. aqueous solution of ferric\r\nchloride. _Purple coloration_ = salicylic acid.\r\n\r\n6. _Sodium Carbonate or Bicarbonate._\r\n\r\nTo 10 c.c. of the milk in a test tube add 10 c.c. of alcohol and 0.3\r\nc.c. of a 1 per cent. alcoholic solution of rosolic acid. _Brownish_\r\ncolor = pure milk; _rose_ color = preserved milk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 211.--Milk-collecting bottle and dipper in case.]\r\n\r\nQuantitative.--\r\n\r\n_Collection of Sample._--\r\n\r\nThe apparatus used for the collection of a retail mixed milk sample\r\nconsists of a cylindrical copper case, 16 cm. high and 9 cm. in\r\ndiameter, provided with a \"pull-off\" lid, containing a milk dipper, also\r\nmade of copper; and inside this, again, a wide-mouthed, stoppered glass\r\nbottle of about 250 c.c. capacity (about 14 cm. high by 7 cm. diameter),\r\nhaving a tablet for notes, sand-blasted on the side. The copper cylinder\r\nand its contents, secured from shaking by packing with cotton-wool, are\r\nsterilised in the hot-air oven (Fig. 26).\r\n\r\nWhen collecting a sample,\r\n\r\n1. Remove the cap from the cylinder.\r\n\r\n2. Draw out the cotton-wool.\r\n\r\n3. Lift out the bottle and dipper together.\r\n\r\n4. Receive the milk in the sterile dipper, and pour it directly into the\r\nsterile bottle.\r\n\r\n5. Enter the particulars necessary for the identification of the\r\nspecimen, on the tablet, with a lead pencil, or pen and ink.\r\n\r\n6. Pack the apparatus in the ice-box for transmission to the laboratory\r\nin precisely the same manner as an ordinary water sample.\r\n\r\n\"Whole\" milk may with advantage be collected in the sterile bottle\r\ndirectly since the mouth is sufficiently wide for the milker to direct\r\nthe stream of milk into it.\r\n\r\n~Condensed milk~ must be diluted with sterile distilled water in\r\naccordance with the directions printed upon the label, then treated as\r\nordinary milk.\r\n\r\n_Apparatus Required_:\r\n\r\n    Case of sterile capsules (25 c.c. capacity).\r\n    Case of sterile graduated pipettes, 10 c.c.\r\n      (in tenths of a cubic centimetre).\r\n    Case of sterile graduated pipettes, 1 c.c.\r\n      (in tenths of a cubic centimetre).\r\n    Flask containing 250 c.c. sterile bouillon.\r\n    Tall cylinder containing 2 per cent. lysol solution.\r\n    Plate-levelling stand.\r\n    Case of sterile plates.\r\n    Tubes nutrient gelatine or gelatine agar.\r\n    Tubes of wort gelatine.\r\n    Tubes of nutrient agar.\r\n    Water-bath regulated at 42 deg. C.\r\n    Bunsen burner.\r\n    Grease pencil.\r\n\r\nMETHOD.--\r\n\r\n1. Arrange four sterile capsules in a row; number them I, II, III, and\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n2. Fill 9 c.c. sterile bouillon into the first, and 9.9 c.c. bouillon\r\ninto each of the three remaining capsules.\r\n\r\n3. Remove 1 c.c. milk from one of the bottles by means of a sterile\r\npipette and add it to the bouillon in capsule I; mix thoroughly by\r\nrepeatedly filling and emptying the pipette.\r\n\r\n4. Remove 0.1 c.c. of the milky bouillon from capsule I, add it to the\r\ncontents of capsule II, and mix as before.\r\n\r\n5. In like manner add 0.1 c.c. of the contents of capsule II to capsule\r\nIII; and then 0.1 c.c. of the contents of capsule III to capsule IV.\r\n\r\n    Then 1 c.c. of dilution   I contains 0.1       c.c. milk sample.\r\n         1 c.c. of dilution  II contains 0.001     c.c. milk sample.\r\n         1 c.c. of dilution III contains 0.00001   c.c. milk sample.\r\n         1 c.c. of dilution  IV contains 0.0000001 c.c. milk sample.\r\n\r\n6. Melt the gelatine and the agar tubes in boiling water; then transfer\r\nto the water-bath and cool them down to 42 deg. C.\r\n\r\n7. Number the gelatine tubes consecutively 1 to 12.\r\n\r\n8. Inoculate the tubes with varying quantities of the material as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    To tube No.  1 add 1.0 c.c. of the milk sample.\r\n                 2 add 0.1 c.c. of the milk sample.\r\n              {  3 add 1.0 c.c. from capsule I.\r\n              {  4 add 0.1 c.c. from capsule I.\r\n              {  5 add 1.0 c.c. from capsule II.\r\n              {  6 add 0.1 c.c. from capsule II.\r\n              {  7 add 0.5 c.c. from capsule III.\r\n              {  8 add 0.3 c.c. from capsule III.\r\n              {  9 add 0.2 c.c. from capsule III.\r\n              { 10 add 0.5 c.c. from capsule IV.\r\n              { 11 add 0.3 c.c. from capsule IV.\r\n              { 12 add 0.2 c.c. from capsule IV.\r\n\r\n9. Pour plates from the gelatine tubes; label, and incubate at 20 deg. C.\r\n\r\n10. Liquefy five wort gelatine tubes and to them add 1.0 c.c. of the\r\nmilk sample and a similar quantity of the diluted milk from capsules I,\r\nII, and III and IV respectively.\r\n\r\n11. Pour plates from the wort gelatine; label, and incubate at 20 deg. C.\r\n\r\n12. Inoculate the liquefied agar tubes as follows:\r\n\r\n    To tube No. 1 add 0.1 c.c. of the milk sample.\r\n                2 add 0.1 c.c. from capsule I.\r\n                3 add 0.1 c.c. from capsule II.\r\n                4 add 0.1 c.c. from capsule III.\r\n                5 add 1.0 c.c. from capsule IV.  }\r\n                6 add 0.1 c.c. from capsule IV.  }\r\n\r\n13. Pour plates from the agar tubes; label, and incubate at 37 deg. C.\r\n\r\n14. After twenty-four hours' incubation \"inspect,\" and after forty-eight\r\nhours' incubation, \"count\" the agar plates and estimate the number of\r\n\"organisms growing at 37 deg. C.\" present per cubic centimetre of the\r\nsample of milk.\r\n\r\n15. After three, four, or five days' incubation, \"count\" the gelatine\r\nplates and estimate therefrom the number of \"organisms growing at 20 deg.\r\nC.\" present per cubic centimetre of the sample of milk.\r\n\r\n16. After a similar interval \"count\" the wort gelatine plates and\r\nestimate the number of moulds and yeasts present per cubic centimetre of\r\nthe sample of milk.\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--Many observers prefer to employ gelatine agar (see\r\n     page 193) for the quantitative examination. In this case\r\n     gelatine-agar plates should be poured from tubes containing\r\n     the quantities of material indicated in step 8, incubated at\r\n     28 deg. C. to 30 deg. C. and after five days the \"total number\r\n     of organisms developing at 28 deg. C.\" recorded.\r\n\r\n~Qualitative.~--The qualitative bacteriological examination of milk is\r\nchiefly directed to the detection of the presence of one or more of the\r\nfollowing pathogenic bacteria and when present to the estimation of\r\ntheir numerical frequency.\r\n\r\n    Members of the Coli-typhoid group.\r\n    Vibrio cholerae.\r\n    Streptococcus pyogenes longus.\r\n    Micrococcus melitensis.\r\n    Staphylococcus pyogenes aureus.\r\n    Bacillus enteritidis sporogenes.\r\n    Bacillus diphtheriae.\r\n    Bacillus tuberculosis.\r\n\r\nSome of these occur as accidental contaminations, either from the water\r\nsupply to the cow farm, or from the farm employees, whilst others are\r\nderived directly from the cow.\r\n\r\nIn milk, as in water examinations, two methods are available, viz.:\r\nEnrichment and Concentration--the former is used for the demonstration\r\nof bacteria of intestinal origin, the latter for the isolation of the\r\nmicro-organisms of diphtheria and tubercle. The first essential in the\r\nlatter process is the concentration of the bacterial contents of a large\r\nvolume of the sample into a small compass; but in the case of milk,\r\nthorough centrifugalisation is substituted for filtration.\r\n\r\n     _Apparatus Required_:\r\n\r\n     A large centrifugal machine. This machine, to be of real\r\n     service in the bacteriological examination of milk, must\r\n     conform to the following requirements:\r\n\r\n     1. The centrifugal machine must be of such size, and should\r\n     carry tubes or bottles of such capacity, as to enable from\r\n     200 to 500 c.c. of milk to be manipulated at one time.\r\n\r\n     2. The rate of centrifugalisation should be from 2500 to\r\n     3000 revolutions per minute.\r\n\r\n     3. The portion of the machine destined to carry the tubes\r\n     should be a metal disc, of sufficient weight to ensure good\r\n     \"flank\" movement, continuing over a considerable period of\r\n     time. In other words, the machine should run down very\r\n     gradually and slowly after the motive power is removed, thus\r\n     obviating any disturbance of the relative positions of\r\n     particulate matter in the solution that is being\r\n     centrifugalised.\r\n\r\n     4. The machine should preferably be driven by electricity,\r\n     or by power, but in the case of hand-driven machines--\r\n\r\n     (a) The gearing should be so arranged that the requisite\r\n     speed is obtained by not more than forty or fifty\r\n     revolutions of the crank handle per minute, so that it may\r\n     be maintained for periods of twenty or thirty minutes\r\n     without undue exertion.\r\n\r\n     (b) The handle employed should be provided with a special\r\n     fastening (e. g., a clutch similar to that employed for\r\n     the free wheel of a bicycle), or should be readily\r\n     detachable so that, on ceasing to turn, the handle should\r\n     not, by its weight and air resistance, act as a brake and\r\n     stop the machine too suddenly.\r\n\r\n     One of the few satisfactory machines of this class is shown\r\n     in figure 212.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 212.--Electrically driven centrifugal machine, with\r\nflexible (broken) spindle encircled by the field magnets of the motor.]\r\n\r\n     Sterile centrifugal tubes, of some 60-70 c.c. capacity,\r\n     tapering to a point at the closed end, plugged with\r\n     cotton-wool.\r\n\r\n     Small centrifugal machine to run two tubes of 10 c.c.\r\n     capacity at 2500 to 3000 revolutions per minute preferably\r\n     driven by electricity, of the type figured on page 327 (Fig.\r\n     162).\r\n\r\n     Sterile centrifugal tubes of 10 c.c. capacity with the\r\n     distal extremity contracted to a narrow tube and graduated\r\n     in hundredths of a cubic centimetre (Fig. 213).\r\n\r\n     Sterilised cork borer.\r\n\r\n     Case of sterile pipettes, 10 c.c. (in tenths of a cubic\r\n     centimetre).\r\n\r\n     Case of sterile pipettes, 1 c.c. (in tenths of a cubic\r\n     centimetre).\r\n\r\n     Sterile teat pipettes.\r\n\r\n     Flask of sterile normal saline solution.\r\n\r\nMETHOD.--\r\n\r\n1. Fill 50 c.c. of the milk sample into each of four tubes, and replace\r\nthe cotton-wool plugs by solid rubber stoppers (sterilised by boiling),\r\nand fit the tubes in the centrifugal machine.\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--One or two cubic centimetres of paraffinum liquidum\r\n     introduced into the buckets of the centrifuge before the\r\n     glass tubes are inserted will obviate any risk of breakage\r\n     to the latter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 213.--Milk sedimenting tubes.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 214.--Milk in centrifuge tube.]\r\n\r\n2. Centrifugalise the milk sample for thirty minutes at a speed of 2500\r\nrevolutions per minute.\r\n\r\n3. Remove the motive power and allow the machine to slow down gradually.\r\n\r\n4. Remove the tubes of milk from the centrifuge. Each tube will now show\r\n(Fig. 214):\r\n\r\n(a) A superficial layer of cream (varying in thickness with different\r\nsamples) condensed into a semi-solid mass, which can be shown to\r\ncontain some organisms and a few leucocytes.\r\n\r\n(b) A central layer of separated milk, thin, watery, and opalescent, and\r\ncontaining extremely few bacteria.\r\n\r\n(c) A sediment or deposit consisting of the great majority of the\r\ncontained bacteria and leucocytes, together with adventitious matter,\r\nsuch as dirt, hair, epithelial cells, faecal debris, etc.\r\n\r\n5. Withdraw the rubber stopper and remove a central plug of cream from\r\neach tube by means of a sterile cork borer; place these masses of cream\r\nin two sterile capsules. Label C^{1} and C^{2}.\r\n\r\n6. Remove all but the last one or two c.c. of separated milk from each\r\ntube, by means of sterile pipettes.\r\n\r\n7. Mix the deposits thoroughly with the residual milk, pipette the\r\nmixture from each pair of tubes into one sterile 10 c.c. tube\r\n(graduated) by means of sterile teat pipettes, then fill to the 10 c.c.\r\nmark with sterile normal saline solution and mix together. Label D^{1}\r\nand D^{2}.\r\n\r\n8. Place the two tubes of mixed deposit in the centrifuge, adjust by the\r\naddition or subtraction of saline solution so that they counterpoise\r\nexactly, and centrifugalise for ten minutes.\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--Each tube now contains the deposit from 100 c.c. of\r\n     the milk sample and the amount can be read off in hundredths\r\n     of a centimetre. The multiplication of this figure by 100\r\n     will give the amount of \"Apparent Filth,\" in \"parts per\r\n     million\"--the usual method of recording this quality of\r\n     milk.\r\n\r\n9. Pipette off all the supernatant fluid and invert the tube to drain on\r\nto a pad of sterilised cotton-wool, contained in a beaker. (This wool is\r\nsubsequently cremated.)\r\n\r\n10. Examine both cream (C^{1}) and deposit (D^{1}) microscopically--\r\n\r\n(a) In hanging-drop preparations.\r\n\r\n(b) In film preparations stained carbolic methylene-blue, by Gram's\r\nmethod, by Neisser's method, and by Ziehl-Neelsen's method.\r\n\r\nNote the presence or absence of altered and unaltered vegetable fibres;\r\npus cells, blood discs; cocci in groups or chains, diphtheroid bacilli,\r\nGram negative bacilli or cocci, spores and acid fast bacteria.\r\n\r\n11. Adapt the final stages of the investigation to the special\r\nrequirements of each individual sample, thus:\r\n\r\n~1. Members of the Coli-typhoid Group.~--\r\n\r\n1. Emulsify the deposit from the second centrifugal tube (D^{2}) with 10\r\nc.c. sterile bouillon and inoculate three tubes of bile salt broth as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    To Tube No. 1 add 2.5 c.c. milk deposit emulsion\r\n      (=25 c.c. original milk.)\r\n    To Tube No. 2 add 1.0 c.c. milk deposit emulsion\r\n      (=10 c.c. original milk.)\r\n    To Tube No. 3 add 0.5 c.c. milk deposit emulsion\r\n      (= 5 c.c. original milk.)\r\n\r\n2. Inoculate tube of bile salt broth No. 4 with 1 c.c. of the original\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\n3. Inoculate further tubes of bile salt broth with previously prepared\r\ndilutions (see page 445) as follows:\r\n\r\n    To tube No.  5 add 1.0 c.c. from capsule I.\r\n    To tube No.  6 add 0.1 c.c. from capsule I.\r\n    To tube No.  7 add 1.0 c.c. from capsule II.\r\n    To tube No.  8 add 0.1 c.c. from capsule II.\r\n    To tube No.  9 add 1.0 c.c. from capsule III.\r\n    To tube No. 10 add 0.1 c.c. from capsule III.\r\n    To tube No. 11 add 1.0 c.c. from capsule IV.\r\n    To tube No. 12 add 0.1 c.c. from capsule IV.\r\n\r\nand incubate anaerobically (in Buchner's tubes) at 42 deg. C. for a\r\nmaximum period of forty-eight hours.\r\n\r\n4. If growth occurs complete the investigation as detailed under the\r\ncorresponding section of water examination (see pages 428 to 431).\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--The B. coli communis, derived from the alvine\r\n     discharges of the cow, is almost universally present in\r\n     large or small numbers, in retail milk. Its detection,\r\n     therefore, unless in enormous numbers, (when it indicates\r\n     want of cleanliness), is of little value.\r\n\r\n~2. Vibrio Cholerae.~--Inoculate tubes of peptone water by using the same\r\namounts as in the search for members of the Coli-typhoid groups (_vide\r\nante_ 1-3); incubate aerobically at 37 deg. C. and complete the\r\nexamination as detailed under the corresponding section of water\r\nexamination (see page 439).\r\n\r\n~3. B. Enteritidis Sporogenes.~--Inoculate tubes of litmus milk with\r\nsimilar amounts to those used in the previous searches, omitting tube\r\nNo. 1 (_vide ante_ 1-3) place in the differential steriliser at 80 deg.\r\nC. for ten minutes and then incubate anaerobically at 37 deg. C. for a\r\nmaximum period of forty-eight hours. Complete the investigation as\r\ndetailed under the corresponding section of water examination (see\r\npage 438).\r\n\r\n~4. B. Diphtheriae.~--\r\n\r\n(A) 1. Plant three sets of serial cultivations, twelve tubes in each\r\nset, from (a) cream C^{2}, (b) deposit D^{1} upon oblique\r\ninspissated blood-serum, and incubate at 37 deg. C.\r\n\r\n2. Pick off any suspicious colonies which may have made their appearance\r\ntwelve hours after incubation, examine microscopically and subcultivate\r\nupon blood-serum and place in the incubator; return the original tubes\r\nto the incubator.\r\n\r\n3. Repeat this after eighteen hours' incubation.\r\n\r\n4. From the resulting growths make cover-slip preparations and stain\r\ncarbolic methylene-blue, Neisser's method, Gram's method. Subcultivate\r\nsuch as appear to be composed of diphtheria bacilli in glucose peptone\r\nsolution. Note those in which acid production takes place.\r\n\r\n5. Inoculate guinea-pigs subcutaneously with one or two cubic\r\ncentimetres forty-eight-hour-old glucose bouillon cultivation derived\r\nfrom the first subcultivation of each glucose fermenter, and observe the\r\nresult.\r\n\r\n6. If death, apparently from diphtheritic toxaemia, ensues, inoculate two\r\nmore guinea pigs with a similar quantity of the lethal culture. Reserve\r\none animal as a control and into the other inject 1000 units of\r\nantidiphtheritic serum. If the control dies and the treated animal\r\nsurvives, the proof of the identity of the organism isolated with the\r\nKlebs-Loeffler bacillus becomes absolute.\r\n\r\n7. Inoculate guinea-pigs subcutaneously with filtered glucose bouillon\r\ncultivations (toxins?) and observe the result.\r\n\r\n(B) 1. Emulsify the remainder of the deposit with 5 c.c. sterile\r\nbouillon and inoculate two guinea-pigs, thus: guinea-pig a,\r\nsubcutaneously with 1 c.c. emulsion; guinea-pig b, subcutaneously with\r\n2 c.c. emulsion; and observe the result.\r\n\r\n2. If either or both of the inoculated animals succumb, make complete\r\npost-mortem examination and endeavour to isolate the pathogenic\r\norganisms from the local lesion. Confirm their identity as in A5 and 6\r\n(_vide supra_).\r\n\r\n~5. Bacillus Tuberculosis.~--\r\n\r\n(A) 1. Inoculate each of three guinea-pigs (previously tested with\r\ntuberculin, to prove their freedom from spontaneous tuberculosis)\r\nsubcutaneously at the inner aspect of the bend of the left knee, with 1\r\nc.c. of the deposit emulsion remaining in one or other tube (D^{1} or\r\nD^{2}).\r\n\r\n2. Introduce a small quantity of the cream into a subcutaneous pocket\r\nprepared at the inner aspect of the bend of the right knee of each of\r\nthese three animals. Place a sealed dressing on the wound.\r\n\r\n3. Observe carefully, and weigh accurately each day.\r\n\r\n4. Kill one guinea-pig at the end of the second week and make a\r\ncomplete post-mortem examination.\r\n\r\n5. If the result of the examination is negative or inconclusive, kill a\r\nsecond guinea-pig at the end of the third week and examine carefully.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 215.--Cadaver of guinea-pig experimentally infected\r\nwith B. tuberculosis.]\r\n\r\n6. If still negative or inconclusive, kill the third guinea-pig at the\r\nend of the _sixth_ week. Make a careful post-mortem examination.\r\nExamine material from any caseous glands microscopically and inoculate\r\nfreely on to Dorset's egg medium.\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--Every post-mortem examination of animals infected\r\n     with tuberculous material should include the naked eye and\r\n     microscopical examination of the popliteal, superficial and\r\n     deep inguinal, iliac, lumbar and axillary glands on each\r\n     side of the body, also the retrohepatic, bronchial and\r\n     sternal glands, the spleen, liver and lungs (Fig. 215).\r\n\r\n(B) 1. Intimately mix all the available cream and deposit from the milk\r\nsample, and transfer to a sterile Erlenmeyer flask.\r\n\r\n2. Treat the mixture by the antiformin method (_vide_ Appendix, page\r\n502).\r\n\r\n3. Inoculate each of two guinea-pigs, intraperitoneally, with half of\r\nthe emulsion thus obtained.\r\n\r\n4. Kill one of the guinea-pigs at the end of the first week and examine\r\ncarefully.\r\n\r\n5. Kill the second guinea-pig at the end of the second week and examine\r\ncarefully.\r\n\r\n6. Utilise the remainder of the deposit for microscopical examination\r\nand cultivations upon Dorset's egg medium.\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--No value whatever attaches to the result of a\r\n     microscopical examination for the presence of the B.\r\n     tuberculosis unless confirmed by the result of inoculation\r\n     experiments.\r\n\r\n~6. Streptococcus Pyogenes Longus.~--\r\n\r\n(A) 1. Spread serial surface plates upon nutrose agar. Also plant serial\r\ncultivations upon sloped nutrient agar (six tubes in series).\r\n\r\n2. If the resulting growth shows colonies which resemble those of the\r\nstreptococcus, make subcultivations upon agar and in bouillon, in the\r\nfirst instance, and study carefully.\r\n\r\n(B) 1. Plant a large loopful of the deposit D^{2} into each of three\r\ntubes of glucose formate bouillon, and incubate anaerobically (in\r\nBuchner's tubes) for twenty-four hours at 37 deg. C.\r\n\r\n2. If the resulting growth resembles that of the streptococcus, make\r\nsubcultivations upon nutrient agar.\r\n\r\n3. Prepare subcultivations of any suspicious colonies that appear, upon\r\nall the ordinary media, and study carefully.\r\n\r\nIf the streptococcus is successfully isolated, inoculate serum bouillon\r\ncultivations into the mouse, guinea-pig, and rabbit, to determine its\r\npathogenicity and virulence.\r\n\r\n~7. Staphylococcus Pyogenes Aureus.~--\r\n\r\n1. Examine carefully the growth upon the serial blood serum cultivations\r\nprepared to isolate B. diphtheriae and the serial agar cultivations to\r\nisolate streptococci after forty-eight hours' incubation.\r\n\r\n2. Pick off any suspicious orange coloured colonies, plant on sloped\r\nagar, and incubate at 20 deg. C. Observe pigment formation.\r\n\r\n3. Prepare subcultivations from any suspicious growths upon all the\r\nordinary media, study carefully and investigate their pathogenicity.\r\n\r\n~8. Micrococcus Melitensis.~--The milk from an animal infected with M.\r\nmelitensis usually contains the organisms in large numbers and but few\r\nother bacteria.\r\n\r\n1. Spread several sets of surface plates upon nutrose agar, each from\r\none loopful of the deposit in tube D^{1} or D^{2}.\r\n\r\n2. Spread several sets of surface plates upon nutrose agar, each from\r\none drop of the original milk sample.\r\n\r\n3. Incubate aerobically at 37 deg. C. and examine daily up to the end\r\nof ten days.\r\n\r\n4. Pick off suspicious colonies, examine them microscopically and\r\nsubcultivate upon nutrose agar in tubes; upon glucose agar and in litmus\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\n5. Test the subsequent growth against the serum of an experimental\r\nanimal inoculated against M. melitensis to determine its\r\nagglutinability.\r\n\r\n6. If apparently M. melitensis, inoculate growth from a nutrose agar\r\nculture after three days incubation intracranially into the guinea-pig.\r\n\r\n\r\nICE CREAM.\r\n\r\n~Collection of the Sample.~--\r\n\r\n1. Remove the sample from the drum in the ladle or spoon with which the\r\nvendor retails the ice cream, and place it at once in a sterile copper\r\ncapsule, similar to that employed for earth samples (_vide_ page 471).\r\n\r\n2. Pack for transmission in the ice-box.\r\n\r\n3. On arrival at the laboratory place the copper capsules containing the\r\nice cream in the incubator at 20 deg. C. for fifteen minutes--that is,\r\nuntil at least some of the ice cream has become liquid.\r\n\r\n~Qualitative and Quantitative Examination.~--Treat the fluid ice cream as\r\nmilk and conduct the examination in precisely the same manner as\r\ndescribed for milk (_vide_ page 443).\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMINATION OF CREAM AND BUTTER.\r\n\r\n~Collection of the Sample.~--Collect, store, and transmit samples to the\r\nlaboratory, precisely as is done in the case of ice cream.\r\n\r\n~Quantitative.~--\r\n\r\n_Apparatus Required_:\r\n\r\n    Sterile test-tube.\r\n    Sterilised spatula.\r\n    Water-bath regulated at 42 deg. C.\r\n    Case of sterile plates.\r\n    Case of sterile graduated pipettes, 1 c.c. (in hundredths).\r\n    Tubes of gelatine-agar (+10 reaction).\r\n    Plate-levelling stand, with its water chamber filled with water at\r\n      42 deg. C.\r\n\r\nMETHOD.--\r\n\r\n1. Transfer a few grammes of the sample to a sterile test-tube by means\r\nof the sterilised spatula.\r\n\r\n2. Place the tube in the water-bath at 42 deg. C. until the contents are\r\nliquid.\r\n\r\n3. Liquefy eight tubes of gelatine-agar and place them in the water-bath\r\nat 42 deg. C, and cool down to that temperature.\r\n\r\n4. Inoculate the gelatine-agar tubes with the following quantities of\r\nthe sample by the help of a sterile pipette graduated to hundredths of a\r\ncubic centimetre--viz.,\r\n\r\n    To tube No. 1 add 1    c.c. liquefied butter.\r\n                2 add 0.5  c.c. liquefied butter.\r\n                3 add 0.3  c.c. liquefied butter.\r\n                4 add 0.2  c.c. liquefied butter.\r\n                5 add 0.1  c.c. liquefied butter.\r\n                6 add 0.05 c.c. liquefied butter.\r\n                7 add 0.03 c.c. liquefied butter.\r\n                8 add 0.02 c.c. liquefied butter.\r\n                9 add 0.01 c.c. liquefied butter.\r\n\r\n5. Pour a plate cultivation from each of the gelatine-agar tubes and\r\nincubate at 28 deg. C.\r\n\r\n6. \"Count\" the plates after three days' incubation, and from the figures\r\nthus obtained estimate the number of organisms present per cubic\r\ncentimetre of the sample.\r\n\r\n~Qualitative.~--\r\n\r\n_Apparatus Required_:\r\n\r\n     Sterile beaker, its mouth plugged with sterile cotton-wool.\r\n\r\n     Counterpoise for beaker.\r\n\r\n     Scales and weights.\r\n\r\n     Sterilised spatula.\r\n\r\n     Water-bath regulated at 42 deg. C.\r\n\r\n     Separatory funnel, 250 c.c. capacity, its delivery tube\r\n     protected against contamination by passing it through a\r\n     cotton-wool plug into the interior of a small Erlenmeyer\r\n     flask which serves to support the funnel. This piece of\r\n     apparatus is sterilised _en masse_ in the hot-air oven.\r\n\r\n     Large centrifugal machine.\r\n\r\n     Sterile tubes (for the centrifuge) closed with solid rubber\r\n     stoppers.\r\n\r\n     Case of sterile pipettes, 10 c.c.\r\n\r\n     Case of sterile graduated pipettes, 1 c.c. (in tenths of a\r\n     cubic centimetre).\r\n\r\nMETHOD.--\r\n\r\n1. Weigh out 100 grammes of the sample in a sterile beaker.\r\n\r\n2. Plug the mouth of the beaker with sterile cotton-wool and immerse the\r\nbeaker in a water-bath at 42 deg. C. until the contents are completely\r\nliquefied.\r\n\r\n3. Fill the liquefied butter into the sterile separatory funnel.\r\n\r\n4. Transfer the funnel to the incubator at 37 deg. C. and allow it to\r\nremain there for four days.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this time the contents of the funnel will have separated\r\ninto two distinct strata.\r\n\r\n(a) A superficial oily layer, practically free from bacteria.\r\n\r\n(b) A deep watery layer, turbid and cloudy from the growth of bacteria.\r\n\r\n5. Draw off the subnatant turbid layer into sterile centrifugal tubes,\r\npreviously warned to about 42 deg. C., and centrifugalise at once.\r\n\r\n6. Pipette off the supernatant fluid and fill the tubes with sterile 1\r\nper cent. sodium carbonate solution previously warmed slightly; stopper\r\nthe tubes and shake vigourously for a few minutes.\r\n\r\n7. Centrifugalise again.\r\n\r\n8. Pipette off the supernatant fluid; filling the tubes with warm\r\nsterile bouillon, shake well, and again centrifugalise, to wash the\r\ndeposit.\r\n\r\n9. Pipette off the supernatant fluid.\r\n\r\n10. Prepare cover-slip preparations, fix and clear as for milk\r\npreparations, stain carbolic methylene-blue, Gram's method,\r\nZiehl-Neelsen's method, and examine microscopically with a 1/12 inch\r\noil-immersion lens.\r\n\r\n11. Proceed with the examination of the deposit as in the case of milk\r\ndeposit (see pages 450 _et seq._).\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMINATION OF UNSOUND MEATS.\r\n\r\n(INCLUDING TINNED OR POTTED MEATS, FISH, ETC.)\r\n\r\nThe bacterioscopic examination of unsound food is chiefly directed to\r\nthe detection of those members of the Coli-typhoid group--B. enteritidis\r\nof Gaertner and its allies--which are usually associated with epidemic\r\noutbreaks of food poisoning, and such anaerobic bacteria as initiate\r\nputrefactive changes in the food which result in the formation of\r\npoisonous ptomaines, consequently the quantitative examination pure and\r\nsimple is frequently omitted.\r\n\r\nA. Cultural Examination.\r\n\r\nQuantitative.--\r\n\r\n_Apparatus Required_:\r\n\r\n     Sterilised tin opener, (if necessary.)\r\n\r\n     Erlenmeyer flask (500 c.c. capacity) containing 200 c.c.\r\n     sterile bouillon and fitted with solid rubber stopper.\r\n\r\n     Counterpoise.\r\n\r\n     Scissors and forceps.\r\n\r\n     Scales and weights.\r\n\r\n     Water steriliser.\r\n\r\n     Hypodermic syringe.\r\n\r\n     Syringe with intragastric tube.\r\n\r\n     Rat forceps.\r\n\r\n     Case of sterile capsules.\r\n\r\n     Filtering apparatus as for water analysis.\r\n\r\n     Case of sterile plates.\r\n\r\n     Case of sterile graduated pipettes, 10 c.c. (in tenths of a\r\n     cubic centimetre).\r\n\r\n     Case of sterile graduated pipettes, 1 c.c. (in tenths of a\r\n     cubic centimetre).\r\n\r\n     Plate-levelling stand.\r\n\r\n     Tubes of nutrient gelatine.\r\n\r\n     Tubes of nutrient agar.\r\n\r\n     Water-bath regulated at 42 deg. C.\r\n\r\n     Bulloch's apparatus.\r\n\r\nMETHOD.--\r\n\r\n1. Place the flask containing 200 c.c. sterile broth on one pan of the\r\nscales and counterpoise accurately.\r\n\r\n2. Mince a portion of the sample by the aid of sterile scissors and\r\nforceps, and add the minced sample to the bouillon in the flask to the\r\nextent of 20 grammes.\r\n\r\n3. Make an extract by standing the flask in the incubator running at 42\r\ndeg. C. (or in a water-bath regulated to that temperature) for half an\r\nhour, shaking its contents from time to time. Better results are obtained\r\nif an electrical shaker is fitted inside the incubator and the flask kept\r\nin motion throughout the entire thirty minutes.\r\n\r\nNow every centimetre contains the bacteria washed out from 0.1 gramme of\r\nthe original food.\r\n\r\n4. Inoculate tubes of liquefied gelatine as follows:\r\n\r\n    To tube No. 1 add 1.0 c.c. of the extract.\r\n                2 add 0.5 c.c. of the extract.\r\n                3 add 0.3 c.c. of the extract.\r\n                4 add 0.2 c.c. of the extract.\r\n                5 add 0.1 c.c. of the extract.\r\n\r\nPour plates from these tubes and incubate at 20 deg. C.\r\n\r\n5. Prepare a precisely similar set of agar plates and incubate at 37\r\ndeg. C.\r\n\r\n6. Pipette 5 c.c. of the extract into a sterile tube, heat in the\r\ndifferential steriliser at 80 deg. C. for ten minutes.\r\n\r\n7. From the heated extract prepare duplicate sets of agar and gelatine\r\nplates and incubate anaerobically in Bulloch's apparatus at 37 deg. C. and\r\n20 deg. C. respectively.\r\n\r\n8. After three days' incubation examine the agar plates both aerobic and\r\nanaerobic and enumerate the colonies developed from spores (7), and from\r\nvegetative forms and spores (5), and calculate and record the numbers of\r\neach group per gramme of the original food.\r\n\r\n9. After seven days' incubation (or earlier if compelled by the growth\r\nof liquefying colonies) enumerate the gelatine plates in the same way.\r\n\r\n10. Subcultivate from the colonies that make their appearance and\r\nidentify the various organisms.\r\n\r\n11. Continue the investigations with reference to the detection of\r\npathogenic organisms as described under water (page 429 _et seq._).\r\n\r\nQualitative.--\r\n\r\nI. _Cultural._\r\n\r\nThe micro-organisms sought for during the examination of unsound foods\r\ncomprise the following:\r\n\r\nMembers of the Coli-typhoid groups (chiefly those of the Gaertner\r\nclass).\r\n\r\nB. anthracis.\r\n\r\nStreptococci\r\n\r\nAnaerobic Bacteria:\r\n\r\n    B. enteritidis sporogenes.\r\n    B. botulinus.\r\n    B. cadaveris.\r\n\r\nThe methods by which these organisms if present may be identified and\r\nisolated have already been described under the corresponding section of\r\nwater examination with the exception of those applicable to B.\r\nbotulinus, and B. cadaveris. These can only be isolated satisfactorily\r\nfrom the bodies of experimentally inoculated animals.\r\n\r\nII _Experimental._\r\n\r\n_Tissue._--\r\n\r\n1. Feed rats and mice on portions of the sample and observe the result.\r\n\r\n2. If any of the animals die, make complete post-mortem examinations and\r\nendeavour to isolate the pathogenic organisms.\r\n\r\n_Extract._--\r\n\r\n1. Introduce various quantities of the bouillon extract into the\r\nstomachs of several rats, mice and guinea-pigs repeatedly over a period\r\nof two or three days by the intragastric method of inoculation (see page\r\n367) and observe the result. Guinea-pigs and mice are very susceptible\r\nto infection by B. botulinus by this method; rabbits less so.\r\n\r\n2. Inoculate rats, mice, and guinea-pigs subcutaneously into deep\r\npockets, and intraperitoneally with various quantities of the bouillon\r\nextract, and observe the result.\r\n\r\n3. Filter some of the extract through a Chamberland candle and incubate\r\nthe filtrate to determine the presence of soluble toxins.\r\n\r\n4. If any of the animals succumb to either of these methods of\r\ninoculation, make careful post-mortem examinations and endeavour to\r\nisolate the pathogenic organisms.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EXAMINATION OF OYSTERS AND OTHER SHELLFISH.\r\n\r\nOn opening the shell of an oyster a certain amount of fluid termed\r\n\"liquor\" is found to be present. This varies in amount from a drop to\r\nmany cubic centimetres (0.1 c.c. to 10 c.c.)--in the latter case the\r\nbulk of the fluid is probably the last quantum of water ingested by the\r\nbivalve before closing its shell. In order to obtain a working average\r\nof the bacteriological flora of a sample, ten oysters should be taken\r\nand the body, gastric juice and liquor should be thoroughly mixed before\r\nexamination. The examination, as in dealing with other food stuffs, is\r\ndirected to the search for members of the Coli-typhoid group, sewage\r\nstreptococci and perhaps also B. enteritidis sporogenes.\r\n\r\n_Apparatus Required_:\r\n\r\n     Two hard nail brushes.\r\n\r\n     Liquid soap.\r\n\r\n     Sterile water in aspirator jar with delivery nozzle\r\n     controlled by a spring clip.\r\n\r\n     Sterile oyster knives.\r\n\r\n     Sterile glass dish, with cover, sufficiently large to\r\n     accommodate ten oysters.\r\n\r\n     Sterile forceps.\r\n\r\n     Sterile scissors.\r\n\r\n     Sterile towels or large gauze pads.\r\n\r\n     Sterile graduated cylinders 1000 c.c. capacity, with either\r\n     the lid or the bottom of a sterile Petri dish inverted over\r\n     the open mouth as a cover.\r\n\r\n     Glass rods.\r\n\r\n     Corrosive sublimate solution, 1 per mille.\r\n\r\n     Bile salt broth tubes.\r\n\r\n     Litmus milk tubes.\r\n\r\n     Surface plates of nutrose agar.\r\n\r\n     Case of sterile pipettes, 1 c.c. (in tenths of a c.c.)\r\n\r\n     Case of sterile pipettes, 10 c.c. (in tenths of a c.c.)\r\n\r\n     Case of sterile glass capsules.\r\n\r\n     Erlenmeyer flasks, 250 c.c. capacity.\r\n\r\n     Double strength bile salt broth.\r\n\r\nMETHOD.--\r\n\r\n1. Thoroughly clean the outside of the oyster shells by scrubbing each\r\nin turn with liquid soap and nail brush under a tap of running water.\r\nThen, holding an oyster shell in a pair of sterile forceps wash every\r\npart of the outside of the shell with a stream of sterile water running\r\nfrom an aspirator jar; deposit the oyster inside the sterile glass dish.\r\nRepeat the process with each of the remaining oysters.\r\n\r\n2. Before proceeding further, cleanse the hands thoroughly with clean\r\nnail brush, soap and water, then plunge them in lysol 2 per cent.\r\nsolution, and finally in sterile water.\r\n\r\n3. Spread a sterile towel on the bench.\r\n\r\n4. Remove one of the oysters from the sterile glass dish and place it,\r\nresting on its convex shell, on the towel. Turn a corner of the sterile\r\ntowel over the upper flat shell to give a firmer grip to the left hand,\r\nwhich holds the shell in position.\r\n\r\n5. With the sterile oyster knife (in the right hand) open the shell and\r\nseparate the body of the oyster from the inner surface of the upper flat\r\nshell. Bend back and separate the flat shell, leaving the body of the\r\noyster in and attached to the concave shell. Avoid spilling any of the\r\nliquor.\r\n\r\n(Some dexterity in opening oysters should be acquired before undertaking\r\nthese experiments).\r\n\r\n6. Cut up the body of the oyster with sterile scissors into small pieces\r\nand allow the liquor freed from the body during the process to mix with\r\nthe liquor previously in the shell.\r\n\r\n7. Transfer the comminuted oyster and the liquor to the cylinder.\r\n\r\n8. Treat each of the remaining oysters in similar fashion.\r\n\r\n9. Mix the contents of the cylinder thoroughly by stirring with a\r\nsterile glass rod. The total volume will amount to about 100 c.c.\r\n\r\n10. Use 0.1 c.c. of the mixed liquor to inseminate each of a series of\r\nthree nutrose surface plates.\r\n\r\n11. Inoculate 0.1 c.c. of the mixed liquor into each of three tubes of\r\nlitmus milk.\r\n\r\n12. Add sterile distilled water to the contents of the cylinder up to\r\n1000 c.c. and stir thoroughly with a sterile glass rod and allow to\r\nsettle. The bacterial content of each oyster may be regarded, for all\r\npractical purposes, as comprised in 100 c.c. of fluid.\r\n\r\n13. Arrange four glass capsules in a row and number I, II, III, IV.\r\nPipette 9 c.c. sterile distilled water into each.\r\n\r\n14. To capsule No. I add 1 c.c. of the diluted liquor, etc. from the\r\ncylinder, and mix thoroughly. To capsule II add 1 c.c. of dilution in\r\ncapsule I and mix thoroughly. Carry over 1 c.c. of fluid from capsule\r\nII to capsule III, afterwards adding 1 c.c. of fluid from capsule III to\r\ncapsule IV.\r\n\r\n15. Label tubes of bile salt broth and inoculate with the following\r\namounts of diluted oysters:\r\n\r\n    No. 6 with 10 c.c. cylinder    fluid = 0.1      oyster.\r\n    No. 5 with  1 c.c. cylinder    fluid = 0.01     oyster.\r\n    No. 4 with  1 c.c. capsule   I fluid = 0.001    oyster.\r\n    No. 3 with  1 c.c. capsule  II fluid = 0.0001   oyster.\r\n    No. 2 with  1 c.c. capsule III fluid = 0.00001  oyster.\r\n    No. 1 with  1 c.c. capsule  IV fluid = 0.000001 oyster.\r\n\r\n16. Transfer 100 c.c. cylinder fluid (= 1 oyster) to an Erlenmeyer flask\r\nand add 50 c.c. double strength bile salt broth, and label 7.\r\n\r\n17. Duplicate all the above indicated cultures.\r\n\r\n18. Put up the tube cultures in Buchner's tubes and incubate\r\nanaerobically at 42 deg. C.\r\n\r\nIf growth occurs in tube 1 the organism finally isolated, e. g., B.\r\ncoli, must have been present to the extent of one million per oyster.\r\n\r\n19. Complete the examination for members of the Coli-typhoid group and\r\nsewage streptococci, as directed under Water Examination, page 429\r\n(steps 11-21).\r\n\r\n20. Inoculate a series of 6 tubes of litmus milk with quantities of the\r\nmaterial similar to those indicated in step 15; heat to 80 deg. C. for ten\r\nminutes, and incubate under anaerobic conditions at 37 deg. C. Examine for\r\nthe presence of B. enteritidis sporogenes as directed under Water\r\nExamination, page 438 (steps 7-10).\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMINATION OF SEWAGE AND SEWAGE EFFLUENTS.\r\n\r\nQuantitative.--\r\n\r\n_Collection of the Sample._--As only small quantities of material are\r\nneeded, the samples should be collected in a manner similar to that\r\ndescribed under water for quantitative examination and transmitted in\r\nthe ice apparatus used in packing those samples.\r\n\r\n_Apparatus Required._--As for water (_vide_ page 420).\r\n\r\nMETHOD.--\r\n\r\n1. Arrange four sterile capsules in a row and number them I, II, III,\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n2. Pipette 9 c.c. sterile bouillon into capsule No. I.\r\n\r\n3. Pipette 9.9 c.c. sterile bouillon into capsules II, III, and IV.\r\n\r\n4. Add 1 c.c. of the sewage to capsule No. I by means of a sterile\r\npipette, and mix thoroughly.\r\n\r\n5. Take a fresh sterile pipette and transfer 0.1 c.c. of the mixture\r\nfrom No. I to No. II and mix thoroughly.\r\n\r\n6. In like manner transfer 0.1 c.c. from No. II to No. III, and then 0.1\r\nc.c. from No. III to No. IV.\r\n\r\nNow 1 c.c. of dilution No.   I contains 0.1       c.c. of the original sewage.\r\n    1 c.c. of dilution No.  II contains 0.001     c.c. of the original sewage.\r\n    1 c.c. of dilution No. III contains 0.00001   c.c. of the original sewage.\r\n    1 c.c. of dilution No.  IV contains 0.0000001 c.c. of the original sewage.\r\n\r\n7. Pour a set of gelatine plates from the contents of each capsule,\r\nthree plates in a set, and containing respectively 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5\r\nc.c. of the dilution. Label carefully; incubate at 20 deg. C. for three,\r\nfour, or five days.\r\n\r\n8. Enumerate the organisms present in those sets of plates which have\r\nnot liquefied, probably those from dilution III or IV, and calculate\r\ntherefrom the number present per cubic centimetre of the original sample\r\nof sewage.\r\n\r\nQualitative.--The qualitative examination of sewage is concerned with\r\nthe identification and enumeration of the same bacteria dealt with under\r\nthe corresponding section of water examination; it is consequently\r\nconducted on precisely similar lines to those already indicated (_vide_\r\npages 426 to 441).\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMINATION OF AIR.\r\n\r\nQuantitative.--\r\n\r\n_Apparatus Required_:\r\n\r\n     Aspirator bottle, 10 litres capacity, fitted with a delivery\r\n     tube, and having its mouth closed by a perforated rubber\r\n     stopper, through which passes a short length of glass\r\n     tubing.\r\n\r\n     Erlenmeyer flask, 250 c.c. capacity (having a wide mouth\r\n     properly plugged with wool), containing 50 c.c. sterile\r\n     water.\r\n\r\n     Rubber stopper to fit the mouth of the flask, perforated\r\n     with two holes, and fitted as follows:\r\n\r\n     Take a 9 cm. length of glass tubing and bend up 3 cm. at one\r\n     end at right angles to the main length of tubing. Pass the\r\n     long arm of the angle through one of the perforations in the\r\n     stopper; plug the open end of the short arm with\r\n     cotton-wool.\r\n\r\n     Take a glass funnel 5 or 6 cm. in diameter with a stem 12\r\n     cm. in length and bend the stem close up to the apex of the\r\n     funnel, in a gentle curve through a quarter of a circle;\r\n     pass the long stem through the other perforation in the\r\n     rubber stopper.\r\n\r\n     A battery jar or a small water-bath to hold the Erlenmeyer\r\n     flask when packed round with ice.\r\n\r\n     Supply of broken ice.\r\n\r\n     Rubber tubing.\r\n\r\n     Screw clamps and spring clips, for tubing.\r\n\r\n     Water steriliser.\r\n\r\n     Retort stand and clamps.\r\n\r\n     Apparatus for plating (as for enumeration of water\r\n     organisms, _vide_ page 420).\r\n\r\nMETHOD.--\r\n\r\n1. Fill 10 litres of water into the aspirating bottle and attach a piece\r\nof rubber tubing with a screw clamp to the delivery tube. Open the taps\r\nfully and regulate the screw clamp, by actual experiment, so that the\r\ntube delivers 1 c.c. of water every second. The screw clamp is not\r\ntouched again during the experiment.\r\n\r\nAt this rate the aspirator bottle will empty itself in just under three\r\nhours. Shut off the tap and make up the contents of the aspirator bottle\r\nto 10 litres again.\r\n\r\n2. Sterilise the fitted rubber cork, with its funnel and tubing, by\r\nboiling in the water steriliser for ten minutes.\r\n\r\n3. Remove the cotton-wool plug from the flask, and replace it by the\r\nrubber stopper with its fittings. Make sure that the end of the stem of\r\nthe funnel is immersed in the bouillon.\r\n\r\n4. Place the flask in a glass or metal vessel and pack it round with\r\npounded ice. Arrange the flask with its ice casing just above the neck\r\nof the aspirator bottle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 216.--Arrangement of apparatus for air analysis.]\r\n\r\n5. Connect up the free end of the glass tube from the flask--after\r\nremoving the cotton-wool plug--with the air-entry tube in the mouth of\r\nthe aspirating bottle (Fig. 216).\r\n\r\n6. Open the tap fully, and allow the water to run.\r\n\r\nReplenish the ice from time to time if necessary.\r\n\r\n(In emptying itself the aspirator bottle will aspirate 10 litres of air\r\nslowly through the water in the Erlenmeyer flask.)\r\n\r\n7. When the aspiration is completed, disconnect the flask and remove it\r\nfrom its ice packing.\r\n\r\n8. Liquefy three tubes of nutrient gelatine and add to them 0.5 c.c.,\r\n0.3 c.c., and 0.2 c.c., respectively, of the water from the flask, by\r\nmeans of a sterile graduated pipette, as in the quantitative examination\r\nof water. Pour plates.\r\n\r\n9. Pour a second similar set of gelatine plates.\r\n\r\n10. Incubate both sets of plates at 20 deg. C.\r\n\r\n11. Enumerate the colonies present in the two sets of gelatine plates\r\nafter three, four, or five days and average the results from the numbers\r\nso obtained; estimate the number of micro-organisms present in 1 c.c.,\r\nand then in the 50 c.c. of broth in the flask.\r\n\r\n12. The result of air examination is usually expressed as the number of\r\nbacteria present per cubic metre (i. e., kilolitre) of air; and as the\r\nnumber of organisms present in the 50 c.c. water only represent those\r\ncontained in 10 litres of air, the resulting figure must be multiplied\r\nby 100.\r\n\r\nQualitative.--\r\n\r\n1. Proceed exactly as in the quantitative examination of air (_vide\r\nsupra_), steps 1 to 10.\r\n\r\n2. Pour plates of wort agar with similar quantities of the air-infected\r\nwater, and incubate at 37 deg. C.\r\n\r\n3. Pour plates of nutrient agar with similar quantities of the water and\r\nincubate at 37 deg. C.\r\n\r\n4. Pour similar plates of wort gelatine and incubate at 20 deg. C.\r\n\r\n5. Pick off the individual colonies that appear in the several plates,\r\nsubcultivate them on the various media, and identify them.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMINATION OF SOIL.\r\n\r\nThe bacteriological examination of soil yields information of value to\r\nthe sanitarian during the progress of the process of homogenisation of\r\n\"made soil\" (e. g., a dumping area for the refuse of town) and\r\ndetermines the period at which such an area may with propriety and\r\nsafety be utilised for building purposes; or to the agriculturalist in\r\ninforming him of the suitability of any given area for the growth of\r\ncrops.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the ground, exposed as it is to the bactericidal\r\ninfluence of sunlight and to rapid alternations of heat and cold, rain\r\nand wind, contains but few micro-organisms. Again, owing to the density\r\nof the molecules of deep soil and lack of aeration on the one hand, and\r\nthe filtering action of the upper layers of soil and bacterial\r\nantagonism on the other, bacterial life practically ceases at a depth of\r\nabout 2 metres. The intermediate stratum of soil, situated from 25 to 50\r\ncm. below the surface, invariably yields the most numerous and the most\r\nvaried bacterial flora.\r\n\r\n~Collection of Sample.~--A small copper capsule 6 cm. high by 6 cm.\r\ndiameter, with \"pull-off\" cap secured by a bayonet catch, previously\r\nsterilised in the hot-air oven, is the most convenient receptacle for\r\nsamples of soil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 217.--Soil scoop.]\r\n\r\nThe instrument used for the actual removal of the soil from its natural\r\nposition will vary according to whether we require surface samples or\r\nsoil from varying depths.\r\n\r\n(a) For ~surface~ samples, use an iron scoop, shaped like a shoe horn,\r\nbut provided with a sharp spine (Fig. 217). This is wrapped in asbestos\r\ncloth and sterilised in the hot-air oven. When removed from the oven,\r\nwrap a piece of oiled paper, silk, or gutta-percha tissue over the\r\nasbestos cloth, and secure it with string, as a further protection\r\nagainst contamination.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the spot whence the samples are to be taken, the coverings\r\nof the scoop are removed, and the asbestos cloth employed to brush away\r\nloose stones and debris from the selected area. The surface soil is then\r\nbroken up with the point of the scoop, scraped up and collected in the\r\nbody of the scoop, and transferred to the sterile capsule for\r\ntransmission.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 218.--Fraenkel's borer.]\r\n\r\n(b) For ~deep~ samples collected at various distances from the surface,\r\nan experimental trench may be cut to the required depth and samples\r\ncollected at the required points on the face of the section. It is,\r\nhowever, preferable to utilise some form of borer, such as that designed\r\nby Fraenkel (Fig. 218).\r\n\r\n_Fraenkel's Earth Borer._--This instrument consists of a stout\r\nhard-steel rod, 150 cm. long, marked in centimetres from the\r\ndrill-pointed extremity. It is provided with a cross handle (adjustable\r\nat any point along the length of the rod by means of a screw nut). The\r\nterminal centimeters are thicker than the remainder of the rod, and on\r\none side a vertical cavity about 0.5 cm. deep is cut. This is covered by\r\na flanged sleeve so long as the borer is driven into the soil clockwise,\r\nand is opened for the reception of the sample of soil, when the required\r\ndepth is reached, by reversing the screwing motion, and again closed\r\nbefore withdrawal of the borer from the earth by resuming the original\r\ndirection of twist. It can be sterilised in a manner similar to that\r\nadopted for the scoop, or by repeatedly filling the cavity with ether\r\nand burning it off.\r\n\r\n~Quantitative.~--Four distinct investigations are included in the complete\r\nquantitative bacteriological examination of the soil:\r\n\r\n1. The enumeration of the aerobic organisms.\r\n\r\n2. The enumeration of the spores of aerobes.\r\n\r\n3. The enumeration of the anaerobic organisms (including the facultative\r\nanaerobes).\r\n\r\n4. The enumeration of the spores of anaerobes.\r\n\r\nFurther, by a combination of the results of the first and second, and of\r\nthe third and fourth of these, the ratio of spores to vegetative forms\r\nis obtained.\r\n\r\n_Apparatus Required_:\r\n\r\n     Case of sterile capsules (25 c.c. capacity).\r\n\r\n     Case of sterile graduated pipettes, 10 c.c. (in tenths of a\r\n     cubic centimetre).\r\n\r\n     Case of sterile graduated pipettes, 1 c.c. (in tenths of a\r\n     cubic centimetre).\r\n\r\n     Flask containing 250 c.c. sterile bouillon.\r\n\r\n     Tall cylinder containing 2 per cent. lysol solution.\r\n\r\n     Plate-levelling stand.\r\n\r\n     12 sterile plates.\r\n\r\n     Tubes of nutrient gelatine.\r\n\r\n     Tubes of wort gelatine.\r\n\r\n     Tubes of nutrient agar.\r\n\r\n     Tubes of glucose formate gelatine.\r\n\r\n     Tubes of glucose formate agar.\r\n\r\n     Water-bath regulated at 42 deg. C.\r\n\r\n     Bunsen burner.\r\n\r\n     Grease pencil.\r\n\r\n     Sterile mortar and pestle (agate).\r\n\r\n     Sterile wide-mouthed Erlenmeyer flask (500 c.c. capacity).\r\n\r\n     Sterile metal funnel with short wide bore delivery tube to\r\n     just fit mouth of flask.\r\n\r\n     Solid rubber stopper to fit the flask (sterilised by\r\n     boiling).\r\n\r\n     Pair of scales.\r\n\r\n     Counterpoise (Fig. 107).\r\n\r\n     Sterile metal (nickel) spoon or spatula.\r\n\r\n     Fractional steriliser (Fig. 140).\r\n\r\nMETHOD.--\r\n\r\n1. Arrange four sterile capsules numbered I, II, III, and IV; pipette 9\r\nc.c. sterile bouillon into the first capsule, and 9.9 c.c. into each of\r\nthe remaining three.\r\n\r\n2. Pipette 100 c.c. sterile bouillon into the Erlenmeyer flask.\r\n\r\n3. Remove the cotton-wool plug from the flask and replace it by the\r\nsterile funnel.\r\n\r\n4. Place flask and funnel on one pan of the scales, and counterpoise\r\naccurately.\r\n\r\n5. Empty the sample of soil into the mortar and triturate thoroughly.\r\n\r\n6. By means of the sterile spatula add 10 grammes of the earth sample to\r\nthe bouillon in the flask.\r\n\r\nThe final results will be more reliable if steps 2, 3, 4, and 5 are\r\nperformed under a hood--to protect from falling dust, etc.\r\n\r\n7. Remove the funnel from the mouth of the flask; replace it by the\r\nrubber stopper and shake vigourously; then allow the solid particles to\r\nsettle for about thirty minutes. One cubic centimetre of the turbid\r\nbroth contains the washings from 0.1 gramme of soil.\r\n\r\n8. Pipette off 1 c.c. of the supernatant bouillon, termed the \"soil\r\nwater,\" and add it to the contents of capsule I; mix thoroughly.\r\n\r\n9. Remove 0.1 c.c. of the infected bouillon from capsule I and add it to\r\ncapsule II, and mix.\r\n\r\n10. In like manner add 0.1 c.c. of the contents of capsule II to capsule\r\nIII, and then 0.1 c.c. of the contents of capsule III to capsule IV.\r\n\r\nThen 1 c.c. fluid from capsule   I contains soil water\r\n  from .01       gm. earth.\r\nThen 1 c.c. fluid from capsule  II contains soil water\r\n  from .0001     gm. earth.\r\nThen 1 c.c. fluid from capsule III contains soil water\r\n  from .000001   gm. earth.\r\nThen 1 c.c. fluid from capsule  IV contains soil water\r\n  from .00000001 gm. earth.\r\n\r\n(A) _Aerobes (Vegetative Forms and Spores)._--\r\n\r\n11. Pour a set of gelatine plates from the contents of each capsule--two\r\nplates in a set, and containing respectively 0.1 c.c. and 0.4 c.c. of\r\nthe diluted soil water. Label and incubate.\r\n\r\n12. Pour similar sets of wort gelatine plates from the contents of\r\ncapsules II and III, label, and incubate at 20 deg. C.\r\n\r\n13. Pour similar sets of agar plates from the contents of capsules II\r\nand III; label and incubate at 37 deg. C.\r\n\r\n14. Weigh out a second sample of soil--10 grammes--dry over a water-bath\r\nuntil of constant weight and calculate the ratio\r\n\r\n    wet soil weight\r\n    ---------------\r\n    dry soil weight\r\n\r\n15. \"Count\" the plates after incubation for three, four, or five days,\r\nand correcting the figures thus obtained by means of the \"wet\" to \"dry\"\r\nsoil ratio estimate--\r\n\r\n(a) The number of aerobic micro-organisms present per gramme of the\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\n(b) The number of yeasts and moulds present per gramme of the soil.\r\n\r\n(c) The number of aerobic organisms \"growing at 37 deg. C.\" present per\r\ngramme of the soil.\r\n\r\n(B) _Anaerobes (Vegetative Forms and Spores)._--\r\n\r\n16. Pour similar sets of plates in glucose formate gelatine and agar and\r\nincubate in Bulloch's anaerobic apparatus.\r\n\r\n(C) _Aerobes and Anaerobes (Spores Only)._--\r\n\r\n17. Pipette 5 c.c. soil water into a sterile tube.\r\n\r\n18. Place in the differential steriliser at 80 deg. C. for ten minutes.\r\n\r\n19. Pour two sets of four gelatine plates containing 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and\r\n1 c.c. respectively of the soil water; label and incubate at 20 deg. C.,\r\none set aerobically, the other anaerobically in Bulloch's apparatus.\r\n\r\n20. \"Count\" the plates (delay the enumeration as long as possible) and\r\nestimate the number of spores of aerobes and anaerobes respectively\r\npresent per gramme of the soil.\r\n\r\n21. Calculate the ratio existing between spores and spores + vegetative\r\nforms under each of the two groups, aerobic and anaerobic\r\nmicro-organisms.\r\n\r\n~Qualitative Examination.~--The qualitative examination of soil is usually\r\ndirected to the detection of one or more of the following:\r\n\r\nMembers of the Coli-typhoid group.\r\n\r\nStreptococci.\r\n\r\nBacillus anthracis.\r\n\r\nBacillus tetani.\r\n\r\nBacillus oedematis maligni.\r\n\r\nThe nitrous organisms.\r\n\r\nThe nitric organisms.\r\n\r\n1. Transfer the remainder of the soil water (88 c.c.) to a sterile\r\nErlenmeyer flask by means of a sterile syphon.\r\n\r\n2. Fix up the filtering apparatus as for the qualitative examination of\r\nwater, and filter the soil water.\r\n\r\n3. Suspend the bacterial residue in 5 c.c. sterile bouillon (technique\r\nsimilar to that described for the water sample, _vide_ pages 434-436).\r\n\r\nEvery cubic centimetre of suspension now contains the soil water from\r\nnearly 1 gramme of earth.\r\n\r\nThe methods up to this point are identical no matter which organism or\r\ngroup of organisms it is desired to isolate; but from this stage onward\r\nthe process is varied slightly for each particular bacterium.\r\n\r\n~I. The Coli-typhoid Group.~--\r\n\r\n~II. Streptococci.~--\r\n\r\n~III. Bacillus Anthracis.~--\r\n\r\n~IV. Bacillus Tetani.~--\r\n\r\nThe methods adopted for the isolation of these organisms are identical\r\nwith those already described under water (page 437 _et seq._).\r\n\r\n~V. Bacillus Oedematis Maligni.~--Method precisely similar to that\r\nemployed for the B. tetani.\r\n\r\n~VI. The Nitrous Organisms.~--\r\n\r\n1. Take ten tubes of Winogradsky's solution No I (_vide_ page 198) and\r\nnumber them consecutively from 1 to 10.\r\n\r\n2. Inoculate each tube with varying quantities of the material as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    To tube No.  1 add 1.0 c.c. of the soil water.\r\n    To tube No.  2 add 0.1 c.c. of the soil water.\r\n    To tube No.  3 add 1.0 c.c. from Capsule I.\r\n    To tube No.  4 add 0.1 c.c. from Capsule I.\r\n    To tube No.  5 add 1.0 c.c. from Capsule II.\r\n    To tube No.  6 add 0.1 c.c. from Capsule II.\r\n    To tube No.  7 add 1.0 c.c. from Capsule III.\r\n    To tube No.  8 add 0.1 c.c. from Capsule III.\r\n    To tube No.  9 add 1.0 c.c. from Capsule IV.\r\n    To tube No. 10 add 0.1 c.c. from Capsule IV.\r\n\r\nLabel and incubate at 30 deg. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n~VII. The Nitric Organisms.~--\r\n\r\n3. Take ten tubes of Winogradsky's solution No II, number them\r\nconsecutively from 1 to 10 and inoculate with quantities of soil water\r\nsimilar to those enumerated in section VI step 2. Label and incubate at\r\n30 deg. C.\r\n\r\n4. Examine after twenty-four and forty-eight hours' incubation. From\r\nthose tubes that show signs of growth make subcultivations in fresh\r\ntubes of the same medium and incubate at 30 deg. C.\r\n\r\n5. Make further subcultivations from such of those tubes as show growth,\r\nand again incubate.\r\n\r\n6. If growth occurs in these subcultures, make surface smears on plates\r\nof Winogradsky's silicate jelly (_vide_ page 198).\r\n\r\n7. Pick off such colonies as make their appearance and subcultivate in\r\neach of these two media.\r\n\r\nTESTING FILTERS.\r\n\r\nPorcelain filter candles are examined with reference to their power of\r\nholding back _all_ the micro-organisms suspended in the fluids which are\r\nfiltered through them, and permitting only the passage of germ-free\r\nfiltrates. In order to determine the freedom of the filter from flaws\r\nand cracks which would permit the passage of bacteria no matter how\r\nperfect the general structure of the candle might be, the candle must\r\nfirst be attached by means of a long piece of pressure tubing, to a\r\npowerful pump, such as a foot bicycle pump, fitted with a manometer. The\r\ncandle is then immersed in a jar of water and held completely submerged\r\nwhilst the internal pressure is gradually raised to two atmospheres by\r\nthe action of the pump. Any crack or flaw will at once become obvious by\r\nreason of the stream of air bubbles issuing from it.\r\n\r\nThe examination for permeability is conducted as follows:\r\n\r\n_Apparatus Required_:\r\n\r\n     Filtering apparatus: The actual filter candle that is used\r\n     must be the one it is intended to test and must be\r\n     previously carefully sterilised; the arrangement of the\r\n     apparatus will naturally vary with each different form of\r\n     filter, one or other of those already described (_vide_\r\n     pages 42-48).\r\n\r\n     Plate-levelling stand.\r\n\r\n     Case of sterile plates.\r\n\r\n     Case of sterile pipettes, 10 c.c. (in tenths).\r\n\r\n     Case of sterile pipettes, 1 c.c. (in tenths).\r\n\r\n     Tubes of nutrient gelatine.\r\n\r\n     Flask containing sterile normal saline solution.\r\n\r\n     Sterile measuring flask, 1000 c.c. capacity.\r\n\r\nMETHOD.--\r\n\r\n1. Prepare surface cultivations, on nutrient agar in a culture bottle,\r\nof the Bacillus mycoides, and incubate at 20 deg. C., for forty-eight\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n2. Pipette 5 c.c. sterile normal saline into the culture bottle and\r\nemulsify the entire surface growth in it.\r\n\r\n3. Pipette the emulsion into the sterile measuring flask and dilute up\r\nto 1000 c.c. by the addition of sterile water.\r\n\r\n4. Pour the emulsion into the filter reservoir and start the filtration.\r\n\r\n5. When the filtration is completed, pour six agar plates each\r\ncontaining 1 c.c. of the filtrate.\r\n\r\n6. Incubate at 37 deg. C. until, if necessary, the completion of seven\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n7. If the filtrate is not sterile, subcultivate the organism passed and\r\ndetermine its identity with the test bacterium before rejecting the\r\nfilter--since the filtrate may have been accidentally contaminated.\r\n\r\n8. If the filtrate is sterile, resterilise the candle and repeat the\r\ntest now substituting a cultivation of B. prodigiosus--a bacillus of\r\nsmaller size.\r\n\r\n9. If the second test is satisfactory, test the candle against a\r\ncultivation of a very small coccus, e. g., Micrococcus melitensis, in\r\na similar manner; in this instance continuing the incubation of\r\ncultivations from the filtrate for fourteen days.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTING OF DISINFECTANTS.\r\n\r\nMethods have already been detailed (page 310) for the purpose of\r\nstudying the vital resistance offered by micro-organisms to the lethal\r\neffect of germicides. But it frequently happens that the bacteriologist\r\nhas to determine the relative efficiency of \"disinfectants\" from the\r\nstandpoints of the sanitarian and commercial man rather than from the\r\nresearch worker's point of view. In pursuing this line of investigation,\r\nit is convenient to compare the efficiency, under laboratory conditions,\r\nof the proposed disinfectant with that of some standard germicide, such\r\nas pure phenol. In so doing, and in order that the work of different\r\nobservers may be compared, conditions as nearly uniform as possible\r\nshould be aimed at. The method described is one that has been in use by\r\nthe writer for many years past, modified recently by the adoption of\r\nsome of the recommendations of the Lancet Commission on the\r\nStandardisation of Disinfectants--particularly of the calculation for\r\ndetermining the phenol coefficient.\r\n\r\nThis method has many points in common with that modification of the\r\n\"drop\" method known as the Rideal-Walker test.\r\n\r\n\r\n~General Considerations.~--\r\n\r\nThese may be grouped under three headings: Test Germ, Germicide, and\r\nEnvironment.\r\n\r\n1. _Test Germ._--~B. coli.~\r\n\r\nAs disinfectants are tested for sanitary purposes, it is obvious that a\r\nmember of the coli-typhoid group should be selected as the test germ. B.\r\ncoli is selected on account of its relative nonpathogenicity, the ease\r\nwith which it can be isolated and identified by different observers in\r\nvarious parts of the world, the stability of its fundamental characters,\r\nand evenness of its resistance when utilised for these tests; finally\r\nsince the colon bacillus is an organism which is slightly more\r\nresistant to the lethal action of germicides than the more pathogenic\r\nmembers of this group, a margin of safety is introduced into the test\r\nwhich certainly enhances its value.\r\n\r\nB. coli should be recently isolated from a normal stool, and plated at\r\nleast twice to ensure the purity of the strain; and a stock agar culture\r\nprepared which should be used throughout any particular test. For any\r\nparticular experiment prepare a smear culture on agar and incubate at\r\n37 deg. C. for 24 hours anaerobically. Then emulsify the whole of the\r\nsurface growth in 10 c.c. of sterile water. Transfer the emulsion to a\r\nsterile test-tube with some sterile glass beads and shake thoroughly to\r\nensure homogenous emulsion. Transfer to a centrifuge tube and\r\ncentrifugalise the emulsion to throw down any masses of bacteria which\r\nmay have escaped the disintegrating action of the beads. Pipette off the\r\nsupernatant emulsion for use in the test.\r\n\r\n_2. Germicide._--\r\n\r\n_a. Disinfectant to be tested._--\r\n\r\nThe first essential point is to test the unknown disinfectant, which may\r\nbe referred to as germicide-x, on the lines set out on page 311 to\r\ndetermine its inhibition coefficient.\r\n\r\nThis constant having been fixed, prepare various solutions of\r\ngermicide-x with sterilised distilled water by accurate volumetric\r\nmethods, commencing with a solution somewhat stronger than that\r\nrepresenting the inhibition coefficient. The solutions must be prepared\r\nin fairly large bulk, not less than 5 c.c. of the disinfectant being\r\nutilised for the preparation of any given percentage solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n_b. Standard Control._--~Phenol.~\r\n\r\nThe standard germicide used for comparison should be one which is not\r\nsubject to variation in its chemical composition, and the one which has\r\nobtained almost universal use is Phenol.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the effect of different percentages of\r\ncarbolic acid upon B. coli for varying contact times, compiled from an\r\nexperiment conducted under the standard conditions referred to under\r\nEnvironment. The results closely correspond to those recorded by the\r\nLancet Commission on Disinfectants, 1909.\r\n\r\n---------------------+-----------------------------------\r\n                     |        Contact time in minutes.\r\nPercentage of phenol +------+---+---+---+---+---+---+----\r\n                     | 2-1/2| 5 |10 | 15| 20| 25| 30| 35\r\n---------------------+------+---+---+---+---+---+---+----\r\n1.20                 |   -  | - | - | - | - | - | - | -\r\n1.10                 |   -  | - | - | - | - | - | - | -\r\n1.0                  |   +  | - | - | - | - | - | - | -\r\n0.9                  |   +  | - | - | - | - | - | - | -\r\n0.85                 |   +  | + | - | - | - | - | - | -\r\n0.80                 |   +  | + | + | - | - | - | - | -\r\n0.75                 |   +  | + | + | + | + | - | - | -\r\n0.7                  |   +  | + | + | + | + | + | - | -\r\n0.65                 |   +  | + | + | + | + | + | + | -\r\n---------------------+------+---+---+---+---+---+---+----\r\n\r\n- = No growth, i. e., bacteria killed.\r\n+ = Growth, i. e., bacteria still living.\r\n\r\nFrom this it will be seen that the following percentage solutions will\r\nneed to be prepared, namely: 1.1 per cent., 1.0 per cent., 0.9 per\r\ncent., 0.75 per cent., 0.7 per cent., as controls for each experiment.\r\n\r\nPrepare solutions of varying percentages by weighing out the quantity of\r\ncarbolic acid required for each and dissolving in 100 c.c. of pure\r\ndistilled water in an accurately standardised measuring flask. The\r\nsolutions must be prepared freshly as required each day.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Environment.~--\r\n\r\n_a. General._--\r\n\r\nClose the windows and doors of the laboratory in which the investigation\r\nis carried out, to avoid draughts. Flush over the work bench and\r\nadjacent floor with 1:1000 solution of corrosive sublimate. Caution the\r\nassistant, if one is employed, to avoid unnecessary movement or speech.\r\n\r\n_b. Contact Temperature_, ~15-18 deg. C.~--\r\n\r\nThis is the temperature at which contact between the germicide and the\r\ntest germ takes place, and is of importance, since some germicides (_e.\r\ng._, Phenol) appear to be more powerful at high temperatures. 18 deg.\r\nC.--practically the ordinary room temperature--is a temperature at which\r\nthe multiplication of B. coli is a comparatively slow process, but\r\nvariation of a degree above this temperature or of two or three degrees\r\nbelow is of no moment. If the room temperature is below 15 deg. C. when\r\nthe experiments are in progress, arrange a water-bath regulated at 18\r\ndeg. C. for the reception of the tubes containing the mixture of germ and\r\ngermicide; if above 19 deg. C. immerse the tubes in cold water, to which\r\nsmall pieces of ice are added from time to time to prevent the\r\ntemperature rising above 18 deg. C.\r\n\r\n_c. Relative Proportional Bulk of Test Germ and Germicide_, ~50:1.~--\r\n\r\nFive cubic centimetres is a convenient amount of germicidal solution to\r\nemploy, and to this 0.1 c.c. of the emulsion of test germ should be\r\nadded.\r\n\r\n_d. Bulk of Sample Removed from Germ + Germicide Mixture at Each of the\r\nTime Periods_, ~0.1 c.c.~--\r\n\r\nThis is sufficient to afford a fair sample of the germ content of the\r\nmixture, and at the same time is insufficient to exert any inhibitory\r\naction when transferred to the subculture medium.\r\n\r\n_e. Subculture Medium._ ~Bile Salt Broth.~--\r\n\r\nA _fluid_ medium is essential in order to obtain immediate dilution of\r\nthe germicide carried over; at the same time it is advantageous to\r\nemploy a selective medium which favours the growth of the test germ to\r\nthe exclusion of organisms likely to contaminate the preparation, and\r\nif possible one which affords characteristic cultural appearances.\r\n\r\nBile Salt Broth (page 180) combines these desiderata; it permits only\r\nthe growth of intestinal bacteria, whilst the formation of an acid\r\nreaction and the production of gas in subcultures prepared from the\r\ngerm-germicide mixture is fairly complete evidence of the presence of\r\nliving B. coli.\r\n\r\nThe amount of medium present in each test-tube is a matter of\r\nimportance, since the medium not only provides pabulum for the test\r\ngerm, but also acts as a diluent to the germicide, to reduce its\r\nstrength below its inhibition coefficient. For routine work each\r\nsubculture tube contains 10 c.c. of medium, but it is obvious that if\r\ngermicide-x possesses an inhibition coefficient of 0.1 per cent. the\r\naddition of 0.1 c.c. of a 10 per cent. solution to 10 c.c. of medium\r\nwould effectually prevent the subsequent growth of the test germ after a\r\ncontact period insufficient to destroy its vitality. Hence the\r\npreliminary tests may in some instances indicate the necessity for the\r\npresence of 12 c.c., 15 c.c. or more of the fluid medium in the culture\r\ntubes.\r\n\r\n_f. Incubation Temperature_, ~37 deg. C.~--\r\n\r\n_g. Observation Period of the Subcultivations_, ~Seven Days.~--\r\n\r\nIn order to determine whether or no the test germs have been destroyed,\r\nobservations must always be continued--when growth appears to be\r\nabsent--up to the end of seven days before recording \"no growth.\"\r\n\r\n_h. Identification of the Organisms Developing in the Subcultivations\r\nafter Contact in the Germ + Germicide Solution._--\r\n\r\nThis is based on the naked eye characters of the growth in the bile salt\r\nbroth, supplemented where necessary by plating methods, further\r\nsubcultivations upon carbohydrate media and agglutination experiments.\r\nThe sign (+) is used to indicate that growth of the test organism\r\noccurred in the subcultivations, and the sign (-) to indicate that the\r\ntest germs have been destroyed and no subsequent growth has taken place.\r\n\r\nMETHOD.--\r\n\r\n     _Apparatus Required_:\r\n\r\n     Sterile test-tubes (narrow, not exceeding 1.3 cm. diameter).\r\n\r\n     Test-tube rack (Fig. 219).\r\n\r\n     Sterile graduated pipettes in case, 1 c.c. (in tenths).\r\n\r\n     Sterile graduated pipettes in case, 5 c.c. (in c.c.).\r\n\r\n     Circular rubber washers, 2.5 cm. diameter with central hole,\r\n     sterilised by boiling immediately before use, then\r\n     transferred to sterilised glass double dish.\r\n\r\n     Electric signal clock or stop watch.\r\n\r\n     Sterile forceps.\r\n\r\n     Sterilised glass beads.\r\n\r\n     Shaking machine.\r\n\r\n     Grease pencil.\r\n\r\n     _Material Required_:\r\n\r\n     Percentage solutions of germicide-x (_vide_ page 481).\r\n\r\n     Percentage solutions of pure phenol (_vide_ page 482).\r\n\r\n     Aqueous emulsion of B. coli (_vide_ page 481).\r\n\r\n     Tubes of bile salt broth.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Preliminary Tests.~--\r\n\r\n_a. Inhibition Coefficient._--\r\n\r\nDetermine the lowest percentage of germicide-x which inhibits growth of\r\nB. coli in the bile salt broth, and the highest percentage which fails\r\nto inhibit (page 311). On the result of this experiment determine the\r\nbulk of medium required in the subculture tubes and the percentage\r\nsolutions to be employed in the trial trip. Assuming the inhibition\r\ncoefficient to be 1:1000, it will be quite safe to employ the ordinary\r\nculture tubes containing 10 c.c. medium in the subsequent experiments.\r\n\r\n_b. Trial Trip._--\r\n\r\nDetermine the lethal effect of a series of five solutions of germicide-x\r\n(say 1:100, 1:250, 1:300, 1:500, 1:600) at contact times of 2-1/2, 5, 25\r\nand 30 minutes in the following manner:\r\n\r\n1. Arrange five test-tubes marked A to E in the lower tier of the\r\ntest-tube rack.\r\n\r\n2. Into tube A pipette 5 c.c. germicide-x 1:100 solution.\r\n\r\nInto tube B pipette 5 c.c. germicide-x 1:200 solution.\r\n\r\nInto tube C pipette 5 c.c. germicide-x 1:300 solution.\r\n\r\nInto tube D pipette 5 c.c. germicide-x 1:500 solution.\r\n\r\nInto tube E pipette 5 c.c. germicide-x 1:600 solution.\r\n\r\n3. Arrange 20 tubes of bile salt broth in the upper tier of the\r\ntest-tube rack in two rows, those in the front row numbered\r\nconsecutively from left to right 1-10, those in the back row 11-20.\r\n\r\n4. Place a square wire basket of about 50 tubes capacity close to the\r\nleft of the test-tube rack, for the reception of the inoculated tubes.\r\n\r\n5. Take a sterile 1 c.c. pipette from the case, pick up a sterile rubber\r\nwasher with forceps and push the point of the pipette into the central\r\nhole.\r\n\r\n6. Put down the forceps on the bench with the sterile points projecting\r\nover the edge. Without taking the tube from the rack remove the\r\ncotton-wool plug from tube A, and lower the pipette, with the rubber\r\nwasher affixed, on to the open mouth of the tube; with the help of the\r\nforceps to steady the washer, push the pipette on through the hole until\r\nthe point of the pipette has reached to within a few millimetres of the\r\nbottom of the tube (see fig. 219).\r\n\r\n7. Adjust in the same way a pipette and a washer in the mouth of each of\r\nthe other tubes, B, C, D and E.\r\n\r\n8. Set the electric signal clock to ring for the commencement of the\r\nexperiment and at subsequent intervals of 2-1/2, 5, 25 and 30 minutes.\r\n\r\n9. Take up 0.5 c.c. of B. coli emulsion in sterile pipette graduated in\r\ntenths of a cubic centimetre and stand by.\r\n\r\n10. As soon as the bell rings lift the pipette from tube A with the left\r\nhand and from the charged pipette held in the right hand deliver 0.1\r\nc.c. of B. coli emulsion into the 1:100 solution. Then replace the\r\npipette and washer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 219.--Test-tube rack.]\r\n\r\n11. Raise the tube with the left hand and shake it to mix germ and\r\ngermicide, whilst returning the delivery pipette in the right hand.\r\n\r\n12. Repeat the process with tubes B, C, D and E; then drop the infected\r\ndelivery pipette in the lysol jar. The inoculation of the five tubes can\r\nbe carried out very expeditiously, but a period of 10 seconds must be\r\nallowed for each tube.\r\n\r\n13. When the bell rings at 2-1/2 minutes blow through the pipette in\r\ntube A (this agitates the germ + germicide mixture and ensures the\r\ncollection of a fair sample); allow the mixture to enter the pipette,\r\nand as the column of fluid extends well above the terminal graduation,\r\nthe right forefinger adjusted over the butt-end of the pipette before it\r\nis lifted will retain more than 0.1 c.c. of the mixture within the bore\r\nwhen the point of the pipette is clear of the fluid in the tube. Touch\r\nthe point of the pipette on the inner wall of the tube, and allow any\r\nexcess of fluid to escape, only retaining 0.1 c.c. in the pipette.\r\n\r\n14. At the same time, with the left hand remove Bile Salt Tube No. 1\r\nfrom the upper tier of the rack, take out the cotton-wool plug with the\r\nhand already holding the pipette (the relative positions of pipette,\r\nplug and culture tubes being practically the same as those of platinum\r\nloop, plug and culture tube shown in Fig. 68, page 74).\r\n\r\n15. Insert the point of the pipette into the subculture tube, and blow\r\nout the mixture into the medium--replug the tube and drop it into the\r\nwire basket. Replace the washer-pipette in tube A.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the point of the pipette has entered the mouth of tube A it\r\nmay be released, since it has already been so adjusted that it just\r\nclears the bottom of the test-tube, and the elastic washer will prevent\r\nany damage to the tube.\r\n\r\nSteps 13, 14 and 15 occupy on an average 10 seconds.\r\n\r\n16. Repeat steps 13, 14 and 15 with each of the other tubes B, C, D and\r\nE.\r\n\r\n17. Repeat these various steps 13-16 when the bell rings at 5, 25 and 30\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n18. Place all the inoculated tubes in the incubator at 37 deg. C.\r\n\r\n19. Examine the tubes at intervals of 24 hours, and record the results\r\nin tabular form as shown in Table page 491 (the figures in the squares\r\nindicate the number of hours at which the changes in the medium due to\r\nthe growth of B. coli first appeared).\r\n\r\n20. If a consideration of the tabulated results indicates strengths of\r\nGermicide-x lethal at 2-1/2 and 30 minutes the final test can be\r\narranged, but if this result has not been attained, sufficient evidence\r\nwill probably be available to enable a second trial test to be planned\r\nwhich will give the required information.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Final Test.~--\r\n\r\nc. _Determination of Phenol Coefficient._--\r\n\r\n_X-Disinfectant._--This comprises two distinct tests, one of the\r\nGermicide-x, the other of the standard phenol.\r\n\r\n1. Arrange five test-tubes clearly marked in the lower tier of the rack.\r\n\r\n2. Pipette into each 5 c.c. respectively of the five percentage\r\nsolutions of x-disinfectant which the trial run has already shown will\r\ninclude those affording lethal values at 2-1/2 and 30 minutes.\r\n\r\n3. Arrange 20 tubes of bile salt broth in the upper tier of the\r\ntest-tube rack in two rows, those in the front row numbered\r\nconsecutively from left to right 1-10, those in the back row 11-20.\r\n\r\n4. Arrange further 20 tubes of bile salt broth numbered 21-40 in two\r\nrows in a second smaller rack which can be stood on the upper tier of\r\nthe rack as soon as the first 20 tubes have been inoculated.\r\n\r\n5. Place a square wire basket of about 50 tube capacity close to the\r\nleft of the test-tube rack, for the reception of the inoculated tubes.\r\n\r\n6. Adjust a sterile 1 c.c. pipette in the mouth of each of the tubes, A,\r\nB, C, D and E, by means of a washer, as previously described.\r\n\r\n7. Set the electric signal clock to ring for the commencement of the\r\nexperiment and subsequently at 2-1/2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n8. Complete precisely as indicated in Trial Runs, steps 9-19.\r\n\r\n_Control Phenol._--\r\n\r\nImmediately the subculture tube from the 30-minute contact period have\r\nbeen inoculated, carry out a precisely similar experiment, in which\r\nfive percentage strengths of Phenol, (e. g., 1.1, 1.0, 0.9, 0.75, 0.7)\r\nare arranged in the lower tier of the test-tube rack in place of the\r\nfive strengths of Germicide-x.\r\n\r\nCalculate the phenol coefficient by the following method:\r\n\r\n(a) Divide the figure representing the percentage strength of the\r\nweakest lethal dilution of the carbolic acid control at the 2-1/2-minute\r\ncontact period by the figure representing the percentage strength of the\r\nweakest lethal dilution of the x-disinfectant at the same period. The\r\nquotient = phenol coefficient at 2-1/2 minutes.\r\n\r\n(b) Similarly obtain the phenol coefficient at 30 minutes contact\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n(c) Record the mean of the two coefficients obtained in (a) and (b) as\r\nthe _mean phenol coefficient_, or simply as the ~Phenol Coefficient~.\r\n\r\nThe details of the Final Test of an actual determination are set out in\r\nthe accompanying table.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE 27\r\n\r\nOrganism employed, B.

and for many other purposes, it becomes necessary to\r\nprepare a series of dilutions of the material under examination, and in\r\norder to avoid unnecessary expenditure of labour it is convenient to\r\nadhere to some definite scale of increment, such for example as the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\nFrom dilutions of 1:10 to 1:80 rise by increments of 5.\r\n\r\nFrom dilutions of 1:80 to 1:200 rise by increments of 10.\r\n\r\nFrom dilutions of 1:200 to 1:400 rise by increments of 25.\r\n\r\nFrom dilutions of 1:400 to 1:500 rise by increments of 50.\r\n\r\nFrom dilutions of 1:500 to 1:1000 rise by increments of 100.\r\n\r\nFrom dilutions of 1: 1000 to 1:5000 rise by increments of 250.\r\n\r\nFrom dilutions of 1: 5000 to 1:10,000 rise by increments of 1000.\r\n\r\nFrom dilutions of 1:10,000 to 1:100,000 rise by increments of 5000.\r\n\r\nFrom dilutions of 1:100,000 to 1:1,000,000 rise by increments of 100,000.\r\n\r\nWhen dealing with a substance of unknown powers--and this is especially\r\ntrue with regard to agglutinating sera--it is customary to run a\r\npreliminary test, using a few widely separated dilutions such as may be\r\nobtained in the following manner:\r\n\r\nFIRST DILUTION--I.\r\n\r\n1 c.c. serum + 9 c.c. normal saline solution = 10 per cent. solution or\r\n1: 10 dilution (of which 1 c.c. contains 0.1 c.c. of the original\r\nserum).\r\n\r\nWhen dealing with fluids other than serum the diluent is usually\r\ndistilled water; whilst if the original substance is a solid the\r\ninstructions would read:\r\n\r\n1 gram o.s. + 10 c.c. distilled water = 10 per cent. solution, etc.\r\n\r\nSECOND DILUTION--II.\r\n\r\n1 c.c. first dilution + 9 c.c. normal saline solution = 1 per cent.\r\nsolution or 1: 100 dilution.\r\n\r\nTHIRD DILUTION--III.\r\n\r\n1 c.c. second dilution + 9 c.c. normal saline solution = 1 per mille\r\nsolution or 1: 1000 dilution.\r\n\r\nFOURTH DILUTION--IV.\r\n\r\n1 c.c. second dilution + 9 c.c. normal saline solution = 0.1 per mille\r\nsolution or 1: 10,000 dilution.\r\n\r\nThe following tables showing the secondary dilutions that can readily be\r\nprepared from each of these four primary dilutions for use in the\r\nsubsequent determination of the exact _titre_ will probably be found of\r\nservice by those who are not ready mathematicians.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLES FOR

Tuberculosis.\r\n\r\n_Antiformin_ was introduced into bacteriological technique by Uhlenhuth\r\nin 1908 for the purpose of demonstrating tubercle bacilli when present\r\nin small numbers, in sputum or other material. It is a powerful\r\noxidising agent and rapidly destroys most bacteria, but tubercle and\r\nother acid-fast organisms resist its lethal action for considerable\r\nperiods, and upon this fact the method is based.\r\n\r\n_To prepare Antiformin_ measure out and mix:--\r\n\r\nEau de Javelle (Liquor sodae chlorinatae--B.P.)  50 c.c.\r\nSodic hydrate 15 per cent. aqueous solution      50 c.c.\r\n\r\nMETHOD.\r\n\r\n1. Introduce the sputum or other material (e. g. milk deposit and cream;\r\npus; minced gland or other organ; caseous material; broken down foci,\r\netc.) into a sterile tube and then add an equal volume of antiformin.\r\n\r\n2. Close the tube with a rubber cork and shake vigorously (a sample of\r\nantiformin that does not \"foam\" at this stage is of little use).\r\nDisintegration of the material at once starts, associated bacteria are\r\ndestroyed and the mixture rapidly becomes a homogenous but turbid\r\nfluid--a process which may be hastened by:--\r\n\r\n3. Placing the tube in the incubator at 37 deg. C. for 30 minutes--shaking\r\nfrom time to time.\r\n\r\n4. Centrifugalise the fluid thoroughly, at high speed.\r\n\r\n5. Pipette off the supernatant fluid, fill up with sterile distilled\r\nwater, cork the tube and shake to distribute the deposit throughout the\r\nwater. Again centrifugalise.\r\n\r\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 twice more.\r\n\r\n7. Employ one portion of the final deposit to inoculate guinea pigs.\r\n\r\n8. Plant the remainder of the deposit freely on Dorset's Egg medium; cap\r\nand incubate at 37 deg. C.\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--If only microscopical films are needed, fill up the\r\n     centrifuge tube with Ligroin (a petroleum ether) in place of\r\n     sterile distilled water in step 5 and prepare the films from\r\n     the _surface_ of the fluid, to stain by the Ziehl-Neelsen\r\n     process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nAbbe's condenser, 7\r\n\r\nAbbott's stain for spores, 107\r\n\r\nAberration, chromatic, 56\r\n  spherical, 55\r\n\r\nAbsolute alcohol as a fixative, 82\r\n  as an antiseptic, 27\r\n\r\nAbsorbent paper for drying cover-slips, 69\r\n\r\nA.

Thus, there were produced in rapid\r\nsuccession a number of works that immediately placed the house in the\r\nfront rank of Medical Publishers. One need only cite such instances as\r\nMusser and Kelly's Treatment, Keen's Surgery, Kelly and Noble's\r\nGynecology and Abdominal Surgery, Cabot's Differential Diagnosis, De\r\nLee's Obstetrics, Mumford's Surgery, Cotton's Dislocations and Joint\r\nFractures, Crandon and Ehrenfried's Surgical After-treatment, Sisson's\r\nVeterinary Anatomy, Anders and Boston's Medical Diagnosis, Gant's\r\nConstipation and Obstruction, Jordan's Bacteriology, and Kemp on\r\nStomach, Intestines, and Pancreas.

He so\r\n     presents pathology that you are able to trace backward from\r\n     any given end-result, such as sclerosis of an organ\r\n     (cirrhosis of the liver, for example), through all the\r\n     various acute lesions that may terminate in that particular\r\n     end-result to the primal _cause_ of the lesion.

Main emphasis has been laid upon those facts\r\n     and views which will be directly helpful in the practical\r\n     branches of medicine. At the same time, however, sufficient\r\n     consideration has been given to the experimental side of the\r\n     science.

He has\r\n     included all the latest technic in every division of the\r\n     subject. His thoroughness, his accuracy, his attention to\r\n     detail make his work an important one. He gives clearly the\r\n     technic for the bacteriologic examination of water, sewage,\r\n     air, soil, milk and its products, meats, etc. And he gives\r\n     you good technic--methods attested by his own large\r\n     experience.

These new terms are live, active words, taken right\r\n     from modern medical literature.\r\n\r\n     It gives the capitalization and pronunciation of all words.\r\n     It makes a feature of the derivation or etymology of the\r\n     words. In some dictionaries the etymology occupies only a\r\n     secondary place, in many cases no derivation being given at\r\n     all. In the American Illustrated practically every word is\r\n     given its derivation.\r\n\r\n     Every word has a separate paragraph, thus making it easy to\r\n     find a word quickly.\r\n\r\n     The tables of arteries, muscles, nerves, veins, etc., are of\r\n     the greatest help in assembling anatomic facts. In them are\r\n     classified for quick study all the necessary information\r\n     about the various structures.\r\n\r\n     Every word is given its definition--a definition that\r\n     _defines_ in the fewest possible words. In some dictionaries\r\n     hundreds of words are not defined at all, referring the\r\n     reader to some other source for the information he wants at\r\n     once.\r\n\r\n~Howard A, Kelly, M.

While the subject of\r\n     pathology is treated in the broadest way consistent with the\r\n     size of the book, an effort has been made to present the\r\n     subject from the point of view of the clinician. In the\r\n     second part of the work the pathology of individual organs\r\n     and tissues is treated systematically and quite fully under\r\n     subheadings that clearly indicate the subject-matter to be\r\n     found on each page. In this edition the section dealing with\r\n     General Pathology has been most extensively revised, several\r\n     of the important chapters having been practically rewritten.\r\n\r\n~The Lancet, London~\r\n\r\n     \"This volume is intended to present the subject of pathology\r\n     in as practical a form as possible, and more especially from\r\n     the point of view of the 'clinical pathologist.'
