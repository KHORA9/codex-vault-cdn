On the one hand, we have\r\nseven witnesses--to be perfectly exact, we have six and a half pairs\r\nof eyes, and one undeniable fact; and on the other we have--what is\r\nit?--prejudice, common sense, the inertia of opinion. Never were there\r\nseven more honest-seeming witnesses; never was there a more undeniable\r\nfact than the inversion of Gottfried Plattner's anatomical structure,\r\nand--never was there a more preposterous story than the one they\r\nhave to tell! The most preposterous part of the story is the worthy\r\nGottfried's contribution (for I count him as one of the seven). Heaven\r\nforbid that I should be led into giving countenance to superstition by\r\na passion for impartiality, and so come to share the fate of Eusapia's\r\npatrons! Frankly, I believe there is something crooked about this\r\nbusiness of Gottfried Plattner; but what that crooked factor is, I\r\nwill admit as frankly, I do not know. I have been surprised at the\r\ncredit accorded to the story in the most unexpected and authoritative\r\nquarters. The fairest way to the reader, however, will be for me to\r\ntell it without further comment.\r\n\r\nGottfried Plattner is, in spite of his name, a free-born Englishman.\r\nHis father was an Alsatian who came to England in the Sixties, married\r\na respectable English girl of unexceptionable antecedents, and died,\r\nafter a wholesome and uneventful life (devoted, I understand, chiefly\r\nto the laying of parquet flooring), in 1887. Gottfried's age is\r\nseven-and-twenty. He is, by virtue of his heritage of three languages,\r\nModern Languages Master in a small private school in the South of\r\nEngland. To the casual observer he is singularly like any other Modern\r\nLanguages Master in any other small private school. His costume is\r\nneither very costly nor very fashionable, but, on the other hand, it\r\nis not markedly cheap or shabby; his complexion, like his height and\r\nhis bearing, is inconspicuous. You would notice, perhaps, that, like\r\nthe majority of people, his face was not absolutely symmetrical, his\r\nright eye a little larger than the left, and his jaw a trifle heavier\r\non the right side. If you, as an ordinary careless person, were to bare\r\nhis chest and feel his heart beating, you would probably find it quite\r\nlike the heart of anyone else. But here you and the trained observer\r\nwould part company. If you found his heart quite ordinary, the trained\r\nobserver would find it quite otherwise. And once the thing was pointed\r\nout to you, you too would perceive the peculiarity easily enough. It is\r\nthat Gottfried's heart beats on the right side of his body.\r\n\r\nNow, that is not the only singularity of Gottfried's structure,\r\nalthough it is the only one that would appeal to the untrained mind.\r\nCareful sounding of Gottfried's internal arrangements, by a well-known\r\nsurgeon, seems to point to the fact that all the other unsymmetrical\r\nparts of his body are similarly misplaced. The right lobe of his liver\r\nis on the left side, the left on his right; while his lungs, too, are\r\nsimilarly contraposed. What is still more singular, unless Gottfried is\r\na consummate actor, we must believe that his right hand has recently\r\nbecome his left. Since the occurrences we are about to consider (as\r\nimpartially as possible), he has found the utmost difficulty in\r\nwriting, except from right to left across the paper with his left hand.\r\nHe cannot throw with his right hand, he is perplexed at meal times\r\nbetween knife and fork, and his ideas of the rule of the road--he is\r\na cyclist--are still a dangerous confusion. And there is not a scrap\r\nof evidence to show that before these occurrences Gottfried was at all\r\nleft-handed.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another wonderful fact in this preposterous business.\r\nGottfried produces three photographs of himself. You have him at the\r\nage of five or six, thrusting fat legs at you from under a plaid frock,\r\nand scowling. In that photograph his left eye is a little larger than\r\nhis right, and his jaw is a trifle heavier on the left side. This\r\nis the reverse of his present living conditions. The photograph of\r\nGottfried at fourteen seems to contradict these facts, but that is\r\nbecause it is one of those cheap \"Gem\" photographs that were then in\r\nvogue, taken direct upon metal, and therefore reversing things just\r\nas a looking-glass would. The third photograph represents him at\r\none-and-twenty, and confirms the record of the others. There seems here\r\nevidence of the strongest confirmatory character that Gottfried has\r\nexchanged his left side for his right. Yet how a human being can be so\r\nchanged, short of a fantastic and pointless miracle, it is exceedingly\r\nhard to suggest.\r\n\r\nIn one way, of course, these facts might be explicable on the\r\nsupposition that Plattner has undertaken an elaborate mystification,\r\non the strength of his heart's displacement. Photographs may be\r\nfudged, and left-handedness imitated. But the character of the man\r\ndoes not lend itself to any such theory. He is quiet, practical,\r\nunobtrusive, and thoroughly sane, from the Nordau standpoint. He\r\nlikes beer, and smokes moderately, takes walking exercise daily, and\r\nhas a healthily high estimate of the value of his teaching. He has a\r\ngood but untrained tenor voice, and takes a pleasure in singing airs\r\nof a popular and cheerful character. He is fond, but not morbidly\r\nfond, of reading,--chiefly fiction pervaded with a vaguely pious\r\noptimism,--sleeps well, and rarely dreams. He is, in fact, the very\r\nlast person to evolve a fantastic fable. Indeed, so far from forcing\r\nthis story upon the world, he has been singularly reticent on the\r\nmatter. He meets inquirers with a certain engaging--bashfulness is\r\nalmost the word, that disarms the most suspicious. He seems genuinely\r\nashamed that anything so unusual has occurred to him.\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that Plattner's aversion to the idea of\r\npost-mortem dissection may postpone, perhaps for ever, the positive\r\nproof that his entire body has had its left and right sides\r\ntransposed. Upon that fact mainly the credibility of his story hangs.\r\nThere is no way of taking a man and moving him about _in space_, as\r\nordinary people understand space, that will result in our changing\r\nhis sides. Whatever you do, his right is still his right, his left\r\nhis left. You can do that with a perfectly thin and flat thing, of\r\ncourse. If you were to cut a figure out of paper, any figure with a\r\nright and left side, you could change its sides simply by lifting it\r\nup and turning it over. But with a solid it is different. Mathematical\r\ntheorists tell us that the only way in which the right and left sides\r\nof a solid body can be changed is by taking that body clean out of\r\nspace as we know it,--taking it out of ordinary existence, that is,\r\nand turning it somewhere outside space. This is a little abstruse,\r\nno doubt, but anyone with any knowledge of mathematical theory will\r\nassure the reader of its truth. To put the thing in technical language,\r\nthe curious inversion of Plattner's right and left sides is proof\r\nthat he has moved out of our space into what is called the Fourth\r\nDimension, and that he has returned again to our world. Unless we\r\nchoose to consider ourselves the victims of an elaborate and motiveless\r\nfabrication, we are almost bound to believe that this has occurred.\r\n\r\nSo much for the tangible facts. We come now to the account of the\r\nphenomena that attended his temporary disappearance from the world.\r\nIt appears that in the Sussexville Proprietary School, Plattner not\r\nonly discharged the duties of Modern Languages Master, but also taught\r\nchemistry, commercial geography, book-keeping, shorthand, drawing, and\r\nany other additional subject to which the changing fancies of the\r\nboys' parents might direct attention. He knew little or nothing of\r\nthese various subjects, but in secondary as distinguished from Board\r\nor elementary schools, knowledge in the teacher is, very properly, by\r\nno means so necessary as high moral character and gentlemanly tone.\r\nIn chemistry he was particularly deficient, knowing, he says, nothing\r\nbeyond the Three Gases (whatever the three gases may be). As, however,\r\nhis pupils began by knowing nothing, and derived all their information\r\nfrom him, this caused him (or anyone) but little inconvenience for\r\nseveral terms. Then a little boy named Whibble joined the school, who\r\nhad been educated (it seems) by some mischievous relative into an\r\ninquiring habit of mind. This little boy followed Plattner's lessons\r\nwith marked and sustained interest, and in order to exhibit his zeal\r\non the subject, brought, at various times, substances for Plattner to\r\nanalyse. Plattner, flattered by this evidence of his power of awakening\r\ninterest, and trusting to the boy's ignorance, analysed these, and even\r\nmade general statements as to their composition. Indeed, he was so far\r\nstimulated by his pupil as to obtain a work upon analytical chemistry,\r\nand study it during his supervision of the evening's preparation. He\r\nwas surprised to find chemistry quite an interesting subject.\r\n\r\nSo far the story is absolutely commonplace. But now the greenish\r\npowder comes upon the scene. The source of that greenish powder seems,\r\nunfortunately, lost. Master Whibble tells a tortuous story of finding\r\nit done up in a packet in a disused limekiln near the Downs. It would\r\nhave been an excellent thing for Plattner, and possibly for Master\r\nWhibble's family, if a match could have been applied to that powder\r\nthere and then. The young gentleman certainly did not bring it to\r\nschool in a packet, but in a common eight-ounce graduated medicine\r\nbottle, plugged with masticated newspaper. He gave it to Plattner at\r\nthe end of the afternoon school. Four boys had been detained after\r\nschool prayers in order to complete some neglected tasks, and Plattner\r\nwas supervising these in the small classroom in which the chemical\r\nteaching was conducted. The appliances for the practical teaching of\r\nchemistry in the Sussexville Proprietary School, as in most small\r\nschools in this country, are characterised by a severe simplicity. They\r\nare kept in a small cupboard standing in a recess, and having about the\r\nsame capacity as a common travelling trunk. Plattner, being bored with\r\nhis passive superintendence, seems to have welcomed the intervention of\r\nWhibble with his green powder as an agreeable diversion, and, unlocking\r\nthis cupboard, proceeded at once with his analytical experiments.\r\nWhibble sat, luckily for himself, at a safe distance, regarding him.\r\nThe four malefactors, feigning a profound absorption in their work,\r\nwatched him furtively with the keenest interest. For even within the\r\nlimits of the Three Gases, Plattner's practical chemistry was, I\r\nunderstand, temerarious.\r\n\r\nThey are practically unanimous in their account of Plattner's\r\nproceedings. He poured a little of the green powder into a test-tube,\r\nand tried the substance with water, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid,\r\nand sulphuric acid in succession. Getting no result, he emptied out a\r\nlittle heap--nearly half the bottleful, in fact--upon a slate and tried\r\na match. He held the medicine bottle in his left hand. The stuff began\r\nto smoke and melt, and then--exploded with deafening violence and a\r\nblinding flash.\r\n\r\nThe five boys, seeing the flash and being prepared for catastrophes,\r\nducked below their desks, and were none of them seriously hurt. The\r\nwindow was blown out into the playground, and the blackboard on its\r\neasel was upset. The slate was smashed to atoms. Some plaster fell\r\nfrom the ceiling. No other damage was done to the school edifice or\r\nappliances, and the boys at first, seeing nothing of Plattner, fancied\r\nhe was knocked down and lying out of their sight below the desks. They\r\njumped out of their places to go to his assistance, and were amazed to\r\nfind the space empty. Being still confused by the sudden violence of\r\nthe report, they hurried to the open door, under the impression that\r\nhe must have been hurt, and have rushed out of the room. But Carson,\r\nthe foremost, nearly collided in the doorway with the principal, Mr.\r\nLidgett.\r\n\r\nMr. Lidgett is a corpulent, excitable man with one eye. The boys\r\ndescribe him as stumbling into the room mouthing some of those tempered\r\nexpletives irritable schoolmasters accustom themselves to use--lest\r\nworse befall. \"Wretched mumchancer!\" he said. \"Where's Mr. Plattner?\"\r\nThe boys are agreed on the very words. (\"Wobbler,\" \"snivelling puppy,\"\r\nand \"mumchancer\" are, it seems, among the ordinary small change of Mr.\r\nLidgett's scholastic commerce.)\r\n\r\nWhere's Mr. Plattner? That was a question that was to be repeated many\r\ntimes in the next few days. It really seemed as though that frantic\r\nhyperbole, \"blown to atoms,\" had for once realised itself. There was\r\nnot a visible particle of Plattner to be seen; not a drop of blood nor\r\na stitch of clothing to be found. Apparently he had been blown clean\r\nout of existence and left not a wrack behind. Not so much as would\r\ncover a sixpenny piece, to quote a proverbial expression! The evidence\r\nof his absolute disappearance, as a consequence of that explosion, is\r\nindubitable.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to enlarge here upon the commotion excited in the\r\nSussexville Proprietary School, and in Sussexville and elsewhere, by\r\nthis event. It is quite possible, indeed, that some of the readers of\r\nthese pages may recall the hearing of some remote and dying version\r\nof that excitement during the last summer holidays. Lidgett, it would\r\nseem, did everything in his power to suppress and minimise the story.\r\nHe instituted a penalty of twenty-five lines for any mention of\r\nPlattner's name among the boys, and stated in the schoolroom that he\r\nwas clearly aware of his assistant's whereabouts. He was afraid, he\r\nexplains, that the possibility of an explosion happening, in spite of\r\nthe elaborate precautions taken to minimise the practical teaching of\r\nchemistry, might injure the reputation of the school; and so might any\r\nmysterious quality in Plattner's departure. Indeed, he did everything\r\nin his power to make the occurrence seem as ordinary as possible. In\r\nparticular, he cross-examined the five eye-witnesses of the occurrence\r\nso searchingly that they began to doubt the plain evidence of their\r\nsenses. But, in spite of these efforts, the tale, in a magnified\r\nand distorted state, made a nine days' wonder in the district, and\r\nseveral parents withdrew their sons on colourable pretexts. Not the\r\nleast remarkable point in the matter is the fact that a large number\r\nof people in the neighbourhood dreamed singularly vivid dreams of\r\nPlattner during the period of excitement before his return, and that\r\nthese dreams had a curious uniformity. In almost all of them Plattner\r\nwas seen, sometimes singly, sometimes in company, wandering about\r\nthrough a coruscating iridescence. In all cases his face was pale and\r\ndistressed, and in some he gesticulated towards the dreamer. One or\r\ntwo of the boys, evidently under the influence of nightmare, fancied\r\nthat Plattner approached them with remarkable swiftness, and seemed to\r\nlook closely into their very eyes. Others fled with Plattner from the\r\npursuit of vague and extraordinary creatures of a globular shape. But\r\nall these fancies were forgotten in inquiries and speculations when, on\r\nthe Wednesday next but one after the Monday of the explosion, Plattner\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances of his return were as singular as those of his\r\ndeparture. So far as Mr. Lidgett's somewhat choleric outline can be\r\nfilled in from Plattner's hesitating statements, it would appear that\r\non Wednesday evening, towards the hour of sunset, the former gentleman,\r\nhaving dismissed evening preparation, was engaged in his garden,\r\npicking and eating strawberries, a fruit of which he is inordinately\r\nfond. It is a large old-fashioned garden, secured from observation,\r\nfortunately, by a high and ivy-covered red-brick wall. Just as he was\r\nstooping over a particularly prolific plant, there was a flash in the\r\nair and a heavy thud, and before he could look round, some heavy body\r\nstruck him violently from behind. He was pitched forward, crushing the\r\nstrawberries he held in his hand, and that so roughly, that his silk\r\nhat--Mr. Lidgett adheres to the older ideas of scholastic costume--was\r\ndriven violently down upon his forehead, and almost over one eye.\r\nThis heavy missile, which slid over him sideways and collapsed into a\r\nsitting posture among the strawberry plants, proved to be our long-lost\r\nMr. Gottfried Plattner, in an extremely dishevelled condition. He\r\nwas collarless and hatless, his linen was dirty, and there was blood\r\nupon his hands. Mr. Lidgett was so indignant and surprised that he\r\nremained on all-fours, and with his hat jammed down on his eye, while\r\nhe expostulated vehemently with Plattner for his disrespectful and\r\nunaccountable conduct.\r\n\r\nThis scarcely idyllic scene completes what I may call the exterior\r\nversion of the Plattner story--its exoteric aspect. It is quite\r\nunnecessary to enter here into all the details of his dismissal by Mr.\r\nLidgett. Such details, with the full names and dates and references,\r\nwill be found in the larger report of these occurrences that was laid\r\nbefore the Society for the Investigation of Abnormal Phenomena. The\r\nsingular transposition of Plattner's right and left sides was scarcely\r\nobserved for the first day or so, and then first in connection with\r\nhis disposition to write from right to left across the blackboard. He\r\nconcealed rather than ostended this curious confirmatory circumstance,\r\nas he considered it would unfavourably affect his prospects in a new\r\nsituation. The displacement of his heart was discovered some months\r\nafter, when he was having a tooth extracted under anæsthetics. He then,\r\nvery unwillingly, allowed a cursory surgical examination to be made of\r\nhimself, with a view to a brief account in the _Journal of Anatomy_.\r\nThat exhausts the statement of the material facts; and we may now go on\r\nto consider Plattner's account of the matter.\r\n\r\nBut first let us clearly differentiate between the preceding portion\r\nof this story and what is to follow. All I have told thus far is\r\nestablished by such evidence as even a criminal lawyer would approve.\r\nEvery one of the witnesses is still alive; the reader, if he have the\r\nleisure, may hunt the lads out tomorrow, or even brave the terrors of\r\nthe redoubtable Lidgett, and cross-examine and trap and test to his\r\nheart's content; Gottfried Plattner, himself, and his twisted heart and\r\nhis three photographs are producible. It may be taken as proved that he\r\ndid disappear for nine days as the consequence of an explosion; that\r\nhe returned almost as violently, under circumstances in their nature\r\nannoying to Mr. Lidgett, whatever the details of those circumstances\r\nmay be; and that he returned inverted, just as a reflection returns\r\nfrom a mirror. From the last fact, as I have already stated, it\r\nfollows almost inevitably that Plattner, during those nine days, must\r\nhave been in some state of existence altogether out of space. The\r\nevidence to these statements is, indeed, far stronger than that upon\r\nwhich most murderers are hanged. But for his own particular account\r\nof where he had been, with its confused explanations and well-nigh\r\nself-contradictory details, we have only Mr. Gottfried Plattner's word.\r\nI do not wish to discredit that, but I must point out--what so many\r\nwriters upon obscure psychic phenomena fail to do--that we are passing\r\nhere from the practically undeniable to that kind of matter which any\r\nreasonable man is entitled to believe or reject as he thinks proper.\r\nThe previous statements render it plausible; its discordance with\r\ncommon experience tilts it towards the incredible. I would prefer not\r\nto sway the beam of the reader's judgment either way, but simply to\r\ntell the story as Plattner told it me.\r\n\r\nHe gave me his narrative, I may state, at my house at Chislehurst, and\r\nso soon as he had left me that evening, I went into my study and wrote\r\ndown everything as I remembered it. Subsequently he was good enough to\r\nread over a type-written copy, so that its substantial correctness is\r\nundeniable.\r\n\r\nHe states that at the moment of the explosion he distinctly thought he\r\nwas killed. He felt lifted off his feet and driven forcibly backward.\r\nIt is a curious fact for psychologists that he thought clearly during\r\nhis backward flight, and wondered whether he should hit the chemistry\r\ncupboard or the blackboard easel. His heels struck ground, and he\r\nstaggered and fell heavily into a sitting position on something soft\r\nand firm. For a moment the concussion stunned him. He became aware at\r\nonce of a vivid scent of singed hair, and he seemed to hear the voice\r\nof Lidgett asking for him. You will understand that for a time his\r\nmind was greatly confused.\r\n\r\nAt first he was distinctly under the impression that he was still in\r\nthe classroom. He perceived quite distinctly the surprise of the boys\r\nand the entry of Mr. Lidgett. He is quite positive upon that score.\r\nHe did not hear their remarks; but that he ascribed to the deafening\r\neffect of the experiment. Things about him seemed curiously dark and\r\nfaint, but his mind explained that on the obvious but mistaken idea\r\nthat the explosion had engendered a huge volume of dark smoke. Through\r\nthe dimness the figures of Lidgett and the boys moved, as faint and\r\nsilent as ghosts. Plattner's face still tingled with the stinging\r\nheat of the flash. He was, he says, \"all muddled.\" His first definite\r\nthoughts seem to have been of his personal safety. He thought he was\r\nperhaps blinded and deafened. He felt his limbs and face in a gingerly\r\nmanner. Then his perceptions grew clearer, and he was astonished to\r\nmiss the old familiar desks and other schoolroom furniture about him.\r\nOnly dim, uncertain, grey shapes stood in the place of these. Then came\r\na thing that made him shout aloud, and awoke his stunned faculties\r\nto instant activity. _Two of the boys, gesticulating, walked one\r\nafter the other clean through him!_ Neither manifested the slightest\r\nconsciousness of his presence. It is difficult to imagine the sensation\r\nhe felt. They came against him, he says, with no more force than a wisp\r\nof mist.\r\n\r\nPlattner's first thought after that was that he was dead. Having been\r\nbrought up with thoroughly sound views in these matters, however, he\r\nwas a little surprised to find his body still about him. His second\r\nconclusion was that he was not dead, but that the others were: that the\r\nexplosion had destroyed the Sussexville Proprietary School and every\r\nsoul in it except himself. But that, too, was scarcely satisfactory. He\r\nwas thrown back upon astonished observation.\r\n\r\nEverything about him was extraordinarily dark: at first it seemed to\r\nhave an altogether ebony blackness. Overhead was a black firmament.\r\nThe only touch of light in the scene was a faint greenish glow at the\r\nedge of the sky in one direction, which threw into prominence a horizon\r\nof undulating black hills. This, I say, was his impression at first.\r\nAs his eye grew accustomed to the darkness, he began to distinguish a\r\nfaint quality of differentiating greenish colour in the circumambient\r\nnight. Against this background the furniture and occupants of the\r\nclassroom, it seems, stood out like phosphorescent spectres, faint\r\nand impalpable. He extended his hand, and thrust it without an effort\r\nthrough the wall of the room by the fireplace.\r\n\r\nHe describes himself as making a strenuous effort to attract attention.\r\nHe shouted to Lidgett, and tried to seize the boys as they went to\r\nand fro. He only desisted from these attempts when Mrs. Lidgett, whom\r\nhe (as an Assistant Master) naturally disliked, entered the room. He\r\nsays the sensation of being in the world, and yet not a part of it,\r\nwas an extraordinarily disagreeable one. He compared his feelings,\r\nnot inaptly, to those of a cat watching a mouse through a window.\r\nWhenever he made a motion to communicate with the dim, familiar world\r\nabout him, he found an invisible, incomprehensible barrier preventing\r\nintercourse.\r\n\r\nHe then turned his attention to his solid environment. He found the\r\nmedicine bottle still unbroken in his hand, with the remainder of the\r\ngreen powder therein. He put this in his pocket, and began to feel\r\nabout him. Apparently, he was sitting on a boulder of rock covered with\r\na velvety moss. The dark country about him he was unable to see, the\r\nfaint, misty picture of the schoolroom blotting it out, but he had a\r\nfeeling (due perhaps to a cold wind) that he was near the crest of a\r\nhill, and that a steep valley fell away beneath his feet. The green\r\nglow along the edge of the sky seemed to be growing in extent and\r\nintensity. He stood up, rubbing his eyes.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that he made a few steps, going steeply down hill, and\r\nthen stumbled, nearly fell, and sat down again upon a jagged mass of\r\nrock to watch the dawn. He became aware that the world about him was\r\nabsolutely silent. It was as still as it was dark, and though there was\r\na cold wind blowing up the hill-face, the rustle of grass, the soughing\r\nof the boughs that should have accompanied it, were absent. He could\r\nhear, therefore, if he could not see, that the hillside upon which he\r\nstood was rocky and desolate. The green grew brighter every moment, and\r\nas it did so a faint, transparent blood-red mingled with, but did not\r\nmitigate, the blackness of the sky overhead and the rocky desolations\r\nabout him. Having regard to what follows, I am inclined to think that\r\nthat redness may have been an optical effect due to contrast. Something\r\nblack fluttered momentarily against the livid yellow-green of the\r\nlower sky, and then the thin and penetrating voice of a bell rose out\r\nof the black gulf below him. An oppressive expectation grew with the\r\ngrowing light.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that an hour or more elapsed while he sat there, the\r\nstrange green light growing brighter every moment, and spreading\r\nslowly, in flamboyant fingers, upward towards the zenith. As it grew,\r\nthe spectral vision of _our_ world became relatively or absolutely\r\nfainter. Probably both, for the time must have been about that of our\r\nearthly sunset. So far as his vision of our world went, Plattner, by\r\nhis few steps downhill, had passed through the floor of the classroom,\r\nand was now, it seemed, sitting in mid-air in the larger schoolroom\r\ndownstairs. He saw the boarders distinctly, but much more faintly\r\nthan he had seen Lidgett. They were preparing their evening tasks,\r\nand he noticed with interest that several were cheating with their\r\nEuclid riders by means of a crib, a compilation whose existence he had\r\nhitherto never suspected. As the time passed, they faded steadily, as\r\nsteadily as the light of the green dawn increased.\r\n\r\nLooking down into the valley, he saw that the light had crept far\r\ndown its rocky sides, and that the profound blackness of the abyss\r\nwas now broken by a minute green glow, like the light of a glow-worm.\r\nAnd almost immediately the limb of a huge heavenly body of blazing\r\ngreen rose over the basaltic undulations of the distant hills, and\r\nthe monstrous hill-masses about him came out gaunt and desolate, in\r\ngreen light and deep, ruddy black shadows. He became aware of a vast\r\nnumber of ball-shaped objects drifting as thistledown drifts over\r\nthe high ground. There were none of these nearer to him than the\r\nopposite side of the gorge. The bell below twanged quicker and quicker,\r\nwith something like impatient insistence, and several lights moved\r\nhither and thither. The boys at work at their desks were now almost\r\nimperceptibly faint.\r\n\r\nThis extinction of our world, when the green sun of this other universe\r\nrose, is a curious point upon which Plattner insists. During the\r\nOther-World night it is difficult to move about, on account of the\r\nvividness with which the things of this world are visible. It becomes a\r\nriddle to explain why, if this is the case, we in this world catch no\r\nglimpse of the Other-World. It is due, perhaps, to the comparatively\r\nvivid illumination of this world of ours. Plattner describes the\r\nmidday of the Other-World, at its brightest, as not being nearly so\r\nbright as this world at full moon, while its night is profoundly\r\nblack. Consequently, the amount of light, even in an ordinary dark\r\nroom, is sufficient to render the things of the Other-World invisible,\r\non the same principle that faint phosphorescence is only visible in\r\nthe profoundest darkness. I have tried, since he told me his story,\r\nto see something of the Other-World by sitting for a long space in a\r\nphotographer's dark room at night. I have certainly seen indistinctly\r\nthe form of greenish slopes and rocks, but only, I must admit, very\r\nindistinctly indeed. The reader may possibly be more successful.\r\nPlattner tells me that since his return he has dreamt and seen and\r\nrecognised places in the Other-World, but this is probably due to his\r\nmemory of these scenes. It seems quite possible that people with\r\nunusually keen eyesight may occasionally catch a glimpse of this\r\nstrange Other-World about us.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is a digression. As the green sun rose, a long street\r\nof black buildings became perceptible, though only darkly and\r\nindistinctly, in the gorge, and, after some hesitation, Plattner began\r\nto clamber down the precipitous descent towards them. The descent was\r\nlong and exceedingly tedious, being so not only by the extraordinary\r\nsteepness, but also by reason of the looseness of the boulders\r\nwith which the whole face of the hill was strewn. The noise of his\r\ndescent--now and then his heels struck fire from the rocks--seemed\r\nnow the only sound in the universe, for the beating of the bell had\r\nceased. As he drew nearer, he perceived that the various edifices had\r\na singular resemblance to tombs and mausoleums and monuments, saving\r\nonly that they were all uniformly black instead of being white, as\r\nmost sepulchres are. And then he saw, crowding out of the largest\r\nbuilding, very much as people disperse from church, a number of pallid,\r\nrounded, pale-green figures. These dispersed in several directions\r\nabout the broad street of the place, some going through side alleys and\r\nreappearing upon the steepness of the hill, others entering some of the\r\nsmall black buildings which lined the way.\r\n\r\nAt the sight of these things drifting up towards him, Plattner stopped,\r\nstaring. They were not walking, they were indeed limbless, and they\r\nhad the appearance of human heads, beneath which a tadpole-like body\r\nswung. He was too astonished at their strangeness, too full, indeed,\r\nof strangeness, to be seriously alarmed by them. They drove towards\r\nhim, in front of the chill wind that was blowing uphill, much as\r\nsoap-bubbles drive before a draught. And as he looked at the nearest\r\nof those approaching, he saw it was indeed a human head, albeit with\r\nsingularly large eyes, and wearing such an expression of distress and\r\nanguish as he had never seen before upon mortal countenance. He was\r\nsurprised to find that it did not turn to regard him, but seemed to be\r\nwatching and following some unseen moving thing. For a moment he was\r\npuzzled, and then it occurred to him that this creature was watching\r\nwith its enormous eyes something that was happening in the world he had\r\njust left. Nearer it came, and nearer, and he was too astonished to\r\ncry out. It made a very faint fretting sound as it came close to him.\r\nThen it struck his face with a gentle pat--its touch was very cold--and\r\ndrove past him, and upward towards the crest of the hill.\r\n\r\nAn extraordinary conviction flashed across Plattner's mind that this\r\nhead had a strong likeness to Lidgett. Then he turned his attention\r\nto the other heads that were now swarming thickly up the hillside.\r\nNone made the slightest sign of recognition. One or two, indeed, came\r\nclose to his head and almost followed the example of the first, but\r\nhe dodged convulsively out of the way. Upon most of them he saw the\r\nsame expression of unavailing regret he had seen upon the first, and\r\nheard the same faint sounds of wretchedness from them. One or two wept,\r\nand one rolling swiftly uphill wore an expression of diabolical rage.\r\nBut others were cold, and several had a look of gratified interest in\r\ntheir eyes. One, at least, was almost in an ecstasy of happiness.\r\nPlattner does not remember that he recognised any more likenesses in\r\nthose he saw at this time.\r\n\r\nFor several hours, perhaps, Plattner watched these strange things\r\ndispersing themselves over the hills, and not till long after they\r\nhad ceased to issue from the clustering black buildings in the gorge,\r\ndid he resume his downward climb. The darkness about him increased so\r\nmuch that he had a difficulty in stepping true. Overhead the sky was\r\nnow a bright, pale green. He felt neither hunger nor thirst. Later,\r\nwhen he did, he found a chilly stream running down the centre of the\r\ngorge, and the rare moss upon the boulders, when he tried it at last in\r\ndesperation, was good to eat.\r\n\r\nHe groped about among the tombs that ran down the gorge, seeking\r\nvaguely for some clue to these inexplicable things. After a long\r\ntime he came to the entrance of the big mausoleum-like building from\r\nwhich the heads had issued. In this he found a group of green lights\r\nburning upon a kind of basaltic altar, and a bell-rope from a belfry\r\noverhead hanging down into the centre of the place. Round the wall\r\nran a lettering of fire in a character unknown to him. While he was\r\nstill wondering at the purport of these things, he heard the receding\r\ntramp of heavy feet echoing far down the street. He ran out into the\r\ndarkness again, but he could see nothing. He had a mind to pull the\r\nbell-rope, and finally decided to follow the footsteps. But, although\r\nhe ran far, he never overtook them; and his shouting was of no avail.\r\nThe gorge seemed to extend an interminable distance. It was as dark\r\nas earthly starlight throughout its length, while the ghastly green\r\nday lay along the upper edge of its precipices. There were none of the\r\nheads, now, below. They were all, it seemed, busily occupied along the\r\nupper slopes. Looking up, he saw them drifting hither and thither, some\r\nhovering stationary, some flying swiftly through the air. It reminded\r\nhim, he said, of \"big snowflakes\"; only these were black and pale green.\r\n\r\nIn pursuing the firm, undeviating footsteps that he never overtook, in\r\ngroping into new regions of this endless devil's dyke, in clambering up\r\nand down the pitiless heights, in wandering about the summits, and in\r\nwatching the drifting faces, Plattner states that he spent the better\r\npart of seven or eight days. He did not keep count, he says. Though\r\nonce or twice he found eyes watching him, he had word with no living\r\nsoul. He slept among the rocks on the hillside. In the gorge things\r\nearthly were invisible, because, from the earthly standpoint, it was\r\nfar underground. On the altitudes, so soon as the earthly day began,\r\nthe world became visible to him. He found himself sometimes stumbling\r\nover the dark green rocks, or arresting himself on a precipitous brink,\r\nwhile all about him the green branches of the Sussexville lanes were\r\nswaying; or, again, he seemed to be walking through the Sussexville\r\nstreets, or watching unseen the private business of some household.\r\nAnd then it was he discovered, that to almost every human being in our\r\nworld there pertained some of these drifting heads: that everyone in\r\nthe world is watched intermittently by these helpless disembodiments.\r\n\r\nWhat are they--these Watchers of the Living? Plattner never learned.\r\nBut two, that presently found and followed him, were like his\r\nchildhood's memory of his father and mother. Now and then other faces\r\nturned their eyes upon him: eyes like those of dead people who had\r\nswayed him, or injured him, or helped him in his youth and manhood.\r\nWhenever they looked at him, Plattner was overcome with a strange\r\nsense of responsibility. To his mother he ventured to speak; but she\r\nmade no answer. She looked sadly, steadfastly, and tenderly--a little\r\nreproachfully, too, it seemed--into his eyes.\r\n\r\nHe simply tells this story: he does not endeavour to explain. We are\r\nleft to surmise who these Watchers of the Living may be, or if they are\r\nindeed the Dead, why they should so closely and passionately watch a\r\nworld they have left for ever. It may be--indeed to my mind it seems\r\njust--that, when our life has closed, when evil or good is no longer\r\na choice for us, we may still have to witness the working out of the\r\ntrain of consequences we have laid. If human souls continue after\r\ndeath, then surely human interests continue after death. But that is\r\nmerely my own guess at the meaning of the things seen. Plattner offers\r\nno interpretation, for none was given him. It is well the reader should\r\nunderstand this clearly. Day after day, with his head reeling, he\r\nwandered about this strange-lit world outside the world, weary and,\r\ntowards the end, weak and hungry. By day--by our earthly day, that\r\nis--the ghostly vision of the old familiar scenery of Sussexville, all\r\nabout him, irked and worried him. He could not see where to put his\r\nfeet, and ever and again with a chilly touch one of these Watching\r\nSouls would come against his face. And after dark the multitude of\r\nthese Watchers about him, and their intent distress, confused his mind\r\nbeyond describing. A great longing to return to the earthly life that\r\nwas so near and yet so remote consumed him. The unearthliness of things\r\nabout him produced a positively painful mental distress. He was worried\r\nbeyond describing by his own particular followers. He would shout at\r\nthem to desist from staring at him, scold at them, hurry away from\r\nthem. They were always mute and intent. Run as he might over the uneven\r\nground, they followed his destinies.\r\n\r\nOn the ninth day, towards evening, Plattner heard the invisible\r\nfootsteps approaching, far away down the gorge. He was then wandering\r\nover the broad crest of the same hill upon which he had fallen in his\r\nentry into this strange Other-World of his. He turned to hurry down\r\ninto the gorge, feeling his way hastily, and was arrested by the sight\r\nof the thing that was happening in a room in a back street near the\r\nschool. Both of the people in the room he knew by sight. The windows\r\nwere open, the blinds up, and the setting sun shone clearly into it, so\r\nthat it came out quite brightly at first, a vivid oblong of room, lying\r\nlike a magic-lantern picture upon the black landscape and the livid\r\ngreen dawn. In addition to the sunlight, a candle had just been lit in\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nOn the bed lay a lank man, his ghastly white face terrible upon the\r\ntumbled pillow. His clenched hands were raised above his head. A little\r\ntable beside the bed carried a few medicine bottles, some toast and\r\nwater, and an empty glass. Every now and then the lank man's lips\r\nfell apart, to indicate a word he could not articulate. But the woman\r\ndid not notice that he wanted anything, because she was busy turning\r\nout papers from an old-fashioned bureau in the opposite corner of the\r\nroom. At first the picture was very vivid indeed, but as the green dawn\r\nbehind it grew brighter and brighter, so it became fainter and more and\r\nmore transparent.\r\n\r\nAs the echoing footsteps paced nearer and nearer, those footsteps\r\nthat sound so loud in that Other-World and come so silently in this,\r\nPlattner perceived about him a great multitude of dim faces gathering\r\ntogether out of the darkness and watching the two people in the room.\r\nNever before had he seen so many of the Watchers of the Living.\r\nA multitude had eyes only for the sufferer in the room, another\r\nmultitude, in infinite anguish, watched the woman as she hunted with\r\ngreedy eyes for something she could not find. They crowded about\r\nPlattner, they came across his sight and buffeted his face, the noise\r\nof their unavailing regrets was all about him. He saw clearly only\r\nnow and then. At other times the picture quivered dimly, through the\r\nveil of green reflections upon their movements. In the room it must\r\nhave been very still, and Plattner says the candle flame streamed\r\nup into a perfectly vertical line of smoke, but in his ears each\r\nfootfall and its echoes beat like a clap of thunder. And the faces!\r\nTwo, more particularly near the woman's: one a woman's also, white\r\nand clear-featured, a face which might have once been cold and hard,\r\nbut which was now softened by the touch of a wisdom strange to earth.\r\nThe other might have been the woman's father. Both were evidently\r\nabsorbed in the contemplation of some act of hateful meanness, so it\r\nseemed, which they could no longer guard against and prevent. Behind\r\nwere others, teachers, it may be, who had taught ill, friends whose\r\ninfluence had failed. And over the man, too--a multitude, but none\r\nthat seemed to be parents or teachers! Faces that might once have\r\nbeen coarse, now purged to strength by sorrow! And in the forefront\r\none face, a girlish one, neither angry nor remorseful, but merely\r\npatient and weary, and, as it seemed to Plattner, waiting for relief.\r\nHis powers of description fail him at the memory of this multitude of\r\nghastly countenances. They gathered on the stroke of the bell. He saw\r\nthem all in the space of a second. It would seem that he was so worked\r\non by his excitement that, quite involuntarily, his restless fingers\r\ntook the bottle of green powder out of his pocket and held it before\r\nhim. But he does not remember that.\r\n\r\nAbruptly the footsteps ceased. He waited for the next, and there was\r\nsilence, and then suddenly, cutting through the unexpected stillness\r\nlike a keen, thin blade, came the first stroke of the bell. At that the\r\nmultitudinous faces swayed to and fro, and a louder crying began all\r\nabout him. The woman did not hear; she was burning something now in the\r\ncandle flame. At the second stroke everything grew dim, and a breath of\r\nwind, icy cold, blew through the host of watchers. They swirled about\r\nhim like an eddy of dead leaves in the spring, and at the third stroke\r\nsomething was extended through them to the bed. You have heard of a\r\nbeam of light. This was like a beam of darkness, and looking again at\r\nit, Plattner saw that it was a shadowy arm and hand.\r\n\r\nThe green sun was now topping the black desolations of the horizon,\r\nand the vision of the room was very faint. Plattner could see that\r\nthe white of the bed struggled, and was convulsed; and that the woman\r\nlooked round over her shoulder at it, startled.\r\n\r\nThe cloud of watchers lifted high like a puff of green dust before the\r\nwind, and swept swiftly downward towards the temple in the gorge. Then\r\nsuddenly Plattner understood the meaning of the shadowy black arm that\r\nstretched across his shoulder and clutched its prey. He did not dare\r\nturn his head to see the Shadow behind the arm. With a violent effort,\r\nand covering his eyes, he set himself to run, made, perhaps, twenty\r\nstrides, then slipped on a boulder, and fell. He fell forward on his\r\nhands; and the bottle smashed and exploded as he touched the ground.\r\n\r\nIn another moment he found himself, stunned and bleeding, sitting face\r\nto face with Lidgett in the old walled garden behind the school.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere the story of Plattner's experiences ends. I have resisted, I\r\nbelieve successfully, the natural disposition of a writer of fiction\r\nto dress up incidents of this sort. I have told the thing as far as\r\npossible in the order in which Plattner told it to me. I have carefully\r\navoided any attempt at style, effect, or construction. It would have\r\nbeen easy, for instance, to have worked the scene of the death-bed\r\ninto a kind of plot in which Plattner might have been involved.\r\nBut, quite apart from the objectionableness of falsifying a most\r\nextraordinary true story, any such trite devices would spoil, to my\r\nmind, the peculiar effect of this dark world, with its livid green\r\nillumination and its drifting Watchers of the Living, which, unseen and\r\nunapproachable to us, is yet lying all about us.\r\n\r\nIt remains to add, that a death did actually occur in Vincent Terrace,\r\njust beyond the school garden, and, so far as can be proved, at\r\nthe moment of Plattner's return. Deceased was a rate-collector and\r\ninsurance agent. His widow, who was much younger than himself, married\r\nlast month a Mr. Whymper, a veterinary surgeon of Allbeeding. As the\r\nportion of this story given here has in various forms circulated orally\r\nin Sussexville, she has consented to my use of her name, on condition\r\nthat I make it distinctly known that she emphatically contradicts every\r\ndetail of Plattner's account of her husband's last moments. She burnt\r\nno will, she says, although Plattner never accused her of doing so:\r\nher husband made but one will, and that just after their marriage.\r\nCertainly, from a man who had never seen it, Plattner's account of the\r\nfurniture of the room was curiously accurate.\r\n\r\nOne other thing, even at the risk of an irksome repetition, I must\r\ninsist upon, lest I seem to favour the credulous superstitious view.\r\nPlattner's absence from the world for nine days is, I think, proved.\r\nBut that does not prove his story. It is quite conceivable that even\r\noutside space hallucinations may be possible. That, at least, the\r\nreader must bear distinctly in mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ARGONAUTS OF THE AIR\r\n\r\n\r\nOne saw Monson's Flying Machine from the windows of the trains passing\r\neither along the South-Western main line or along the line between\r\nWimbledon and Worcester Park,--to be more exact, one saw the huge\r\nscaffoldings which limited the flight of the apparatus. They rose over\r\nthe tree-tops, a massive alley of interlacing iron and timber, and an\r\nenormous web of ropes and tackle, extending the best part of two miles.\r\nFrom the Leatherhead branch this alley was foreshortened and in part\r\nhidden by a hill with villas; but from the main line one had it in\r\nprofile, a complex tangle of girders and curving bars, very impressive\r\nto the excursionists from Portsmouth and Southampton and the West.\r\nMonson had taken up the work where Maxim had left it, had gone on at\r\nfirst with an utter contempt for the journalistic wit and ignorance\r\nthat had irritated and hampered his predecessor, and had spent (it was\r\nsaid) rather more than half his immense fortune upon his experiments.\r\nThe results, to an impatient generation, seemed inconsiderable. When\r\nsome five years had passed after the growth of the colossal iron groves\r\nat Worcester Park, and Monson still failed to put in a fluttering\r\nappearance over Trafalgar Square, even the Isle of Wight trippers felt\r\ntheir liberty to smile. And such intelligent people as did not consider\r\nMonson a fool stricken with the mania for invention, denounced him as\r\nbeing (for no particular reason) a self-advertising quack.\r\n\r\nYet now and again a morning trainload of season-ticket holders would\r\nsee a white monster rush headlong through the airy tracery of guides\r\nand bars, and hear the further stays, nettings, and buffers snap,\r\ncreak, and groan with the impact of the blow. Then there would be\r\nan efflorescence of black-set white-rimmed faces along the sides of\r\nthe train, and the morning papers would be neglected for a vigorous\r\ndiscussion of the possibility of flying (in which nothing new was ever\r\nsaid by any chance), until the train reached Waterloo, and its cargo\r\nof season-ticket holders dispersed themselves over London. Or the\r\nfathers and mothers in some multitudinous train of weary excursionists\r\nreturning exhausted from a day of rest by the sea, would find the dark\r\nfabric, standing out against the evening sky, useful in diverting some\r\nbilious child from its introspection, and be suddenly startled by the\r\nswift transit of a huge black flapping shape that strained upward\r\nagainst the guides. It was a great and forcible thing beyond dispute,\r\nand excellent for conversation; yet, all the same, it was but flying in\r\nleading-strings, and most of those who witnessed it scarcely counted\r\nits flight as flying. More of a switchback it seemed to the run of the\r\nfolk.\r\n\r\nMonson, I say, did not trouble himself very keenly about the opinions\r\nof the press at first. But possibly he, even, had formed but a poor\r\nidea of the time it would take before the tactics of flying were\r\nmastered, the swift assured adjustment of the big soaring shape to\r\nevery gust and chance movement of the air; nor had he clearly reckoned\r\nthe money this prolonged struggle against gravitation would cost\r\nhim. And he was not so pachydermatous as he seemed. Secretly he had\r\nhis periodical bundles of cuttings sent him by Romeike, he had his\r\nperiodical reminders from his banker; and if he did not mind the\r\ninitial ridicule and scepticism, he felt the growing neglect as the\r\nmonths went by and the money dribbled away. Time was when Monson had\r\nsent the enterprising journalist, keen after readable matter, empty\r\nfrom his gates. But when the enterprising journalist ceased from\r\ntroubling, Monson was anything but satisfied in his heart of hearts.\r\nStill day by day the work went on, and the multitudinous subtle\r\ndifficulties of the steering diminished in number. Day by day, too,\r\nthe money trickled away, until his balance was no longer a matter of\r\nhundreds of thousands, but of tens. And at last came an anniversary.\r\n\r\nMonson, sitting in the little drawing-shed, suddenly noticed the date\r\non Woodhouse's calendar.\r\n\r\n\"It was five years ago to-day that we began,\" he said to Woodhouse\r\nsuddenly.\r\n\r\n\"Is it?\" said Woodhouse.\r\n\r\n\"It's the alterations play the devil with us,\" said Monson, biting a\r\npaper-fastener.\r\n\r\nThe drawings for the new vans to the hinder screw lay on the table\r\nbefore him as he spoke. He pitched the mutilated brass paper-fastener\r\ninto the waste-paper basket and drummed with his fingers. \"These\r\nalterations! Will the mathematicians ever be clever enough to save us\r\nall this patching and experimenting? Five years--learning by rule of\r\nthumb, when one might think that it was possible to calculate the whole\r\nthing out beforehand. The cost of it! I might have hired three senior\r\nwranglers for life. But they'd only have developed some beautifully\r\nuseless theorems in pneumatics. What a time it has been, Woodhouse!\"\r\n\r\n\"These mouldings will take three weeks,\" said Woodhouse. \"At special\r\nprices.\"\r\n\r\n\"Three weeks!\" said Monson, and sat drumming.\r\n\r\n\"Three weeks certain,\" said Woodhouse, an excellent engineer, but no\r\ngood as a comforter. He drew the sheets towards him and began shading a\r\nbar.\r\n\r\nMonson stopped drumming, and began to bite his finger-nails, staring\r\nthe while at Woodhouse's head.\r\n\r\n\"How long have they been calling this Monson's Folly?\" he said suddenly.\r\n\r\n\"_Oh!_ Year or so,\" said Woodhouse carelessly, without looking up.\r\n\r\nMonson sucked the air in between his teeth, and went to the window. The\r\nstout iron columns carrying the elevated rails upon which the start of\r\nthe machine was made rose up close by, and the machine was hidden by\r\nthe upper edge of the window. Through the grove of iron pillars, red\r\npainted and ornate with rows of bolts, one had a glimpse of the pretty\r\nscenery towards Esher. A train went gliding noiselessly across the\r\nmiddle distance, its rattle drowned by the hammering of the workmen\r\noverhead. Monson could imagine the grinning faces at the windows of the\r\ncarriages. He swore savagely under his breath, and dabbed viciously at\r\na blowfly that suddenly became noisy on the window-pane.\r\n\r\n\"What's up?\" said Woodhouse, staring in surprise at his employer.\r\n\r\n\"I'm about sick of this.\"\r\n\r\nWoodhouse scratched his cheek. \"Oh!\" he said, after an assimilating\r\npause. He pushed the drawing away from him.\r\n\r\n\"Here these fools ... I'm trying to conquer a new element--trying to\r\ndo a thing that will revolutionise life. And instead of taking an\r\nintelligent interest, they grin and make their stupid jokes, and call\r\nme and my appliances names.\"\r\n\r\n\"Asses!\" said Woodhouse, letting his eye fall again on the drawing.\r\n\r\nThe epithet, curiously enough, made Monson wince. \"I'm about sick of\r\nit, Woodhouse, anyhow,\" he said, after a pause.\r\n\r\nWoodhouse shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"There's nothing for it but patience, I suppose,\" said Monson, sticking\r\nhis hands in his pockets. \"I've started. I've made my bed, and I've got\r\nto lie on it. I can't go back. I'll see it through, and spend every\r\npenny I have and every penny I can borrow. But I tell you, Woodhouse,\r\nI'm infernally sick of it, all the same. If I'd paid a tenth part of\r\nthe money towards some political greaser's expenses--I'd have been a\r\nbaronet before this.\"\r\n\r\nMonson paused. Woodhouse stared in front of him with a blank expression\r\nhe always employed to indicate sympathy, and tapped his pencil-case on\r\nthe table. Monson stared at him for a minute.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, _damn_!\" said Monson suddenly, and abruptly rushed out of the room.\r\n\r\nWoodhouse continued his sympathetic rigour for perhaps half a minute.\r\nThen he sighed and resumed the shading of the drawings. Something had\r\nevidently upset Monson. Nice chap, and generous, but difficult to get\r\non with. It was the way with every amateur who had anything to do with\r\nengineering--wanted everything finished at once. But Monson had usually\r\nthe patience of the expert. Odd he was so irritable. Nice and round\r\nthat aluminium rod did look now! Woodhouse threw back his head, and put\r\nit, first this side and then that, to appreciate his bit of shading\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Woodhouse,\" said Hooper, the foreman of the labourers, putting his\r\nhead in at the door.\r\n\r\n\"Hullo!\" said Woodhouse, without turning round.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing happened, sir?\" said Hooper.\r\n\r\n\"Happened?\" said Woodhouse.\r\n\r\n\"The governor just been up the rails swearing like a tornader.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Oh!_\" said Woodhouse.\r\n\r\n\"It ain't like him, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"No?\"\r\n\r\n\"And I was thinking perhaps\"--\r\n\r\n\"Don't think,\" said Woodhouse, still admiring the drawings.\r\n\r\nHooper knew Woodhouse, and he shut the door suddenly with a vicious\r\nslam. Woodhouse stared stonily before him for some further minutes,\r\nand then made an ineffectual effort to pick his teeth with his pencil.\r\nAbruptly he desisted, pitched that old, tried, and stumpy servitor\r\nacross the room, got up, stretched himself, and followed Hooper.\r\n\r\nHe looked ruffled--it was visible to every workman he met. When a\r\nmillionaire who has been spending thousands on experiments that employ\r\nquite a little army of people suddenly indicates that he is sick of\r\nthe undertaking, there is almost invariably a certain amount of mental\r\nfriction in the ranks of the little army he employs. And even before he\r\nindicates his intentions there are speculations and murmurs, a watching\r\nof faces and a study of straws. Hundreds of people knew before the day\r\nwas out that Monson was ruffled, Woodhouse ruffled, Hooper ruffled. A\r\nworkman's wife, for instance (whom Monson had never seen), decided to\r\nkeep her money in the savings-bank instead of buying a velveteen dress.\r\nSo far-reaching are even the casual curses of a millionaire.\r\n\r\nMonson found a certain satisfaction in going on the works and behaving\r\ndisagreeably to as many people as possible. After a time even\r\nthat palled upon him, and he rode off the grounds, to every one's\r\nrelief there, and through the lanes south-eastward, to the infinite\r\ntribulation of his house steward at Cheam.\r\n\r\nAnd the immediate cause of it all, the little grain of annoyance that\r\nhad suddenly precipitated all this discontent with his life-work\r\nwas--these trivial things that direct all our great decisions!--half\r\na dozen ill-considered remarks made by a pretty girl, prettily\r\ndressed, with a beautiful voice and something more than prettiness\r\nin her soft grey eyes. And of these half-dozen remarks, two words\r\nespecially--\"Monson's Folly.\" She had felt she was behaving charmingly\r\nto Monson; she reflected the next day how exceptionally effective she\r\nhad been, and no one would have been more amazed than she, had she\r\nlearned the effect she had left on Monson's mind. I hope, considering\r\neverything, that she never knew.\r\n\r\n\"How are you getting on with your flying-machine?\" she asked. (\"I\r\nwonder if I shall ever meet any one with the sense not to ask that,\"\r\nthought Monson.) \"It will be very dangerous at first, will it not?\"\r\n(\"Thinks I'm afraid.\") \"Jorgon is going to play presently; have you\r\nheard him before?\" (\"My mania being attended to, we turn to rational\r\nconversation.\") Gush about Jorgon; gradual decline of conversation,\r\nending with--\"You must let me know when your flying-machine is\r\nfinished, Mr. Monson, and then I will consider the advisability of\r\ntaking a ticket.\" (\"One would think I was still playing inventions\r\nin the nursery.\") But the bitterest thing she said was not meant for\r\nMonson's ears. To Phlox, the novelist, she was always conscientiously\r\nbrilliant. \"I have been talking to Mr. Monson, and he can think of\r\nnothing, positively nothing, but that flying-machine of his. Do you\r\nknow, all his workmen call that place of his 'Monson's Folly'? He is\r\nquite impossible. It is really very, very sad. I always regard him\r\nmyself in the light of sunken treasure--the Lost Millionaire, you know.\"\r\n\r\nShe was pretty and well educated,--indeed, she had written an\r\nepigrammatic novelette; but the bitterness was that she was typical.\r\nShe summarised what the world thought of the man who was working\r\nsanely, steadily, and surely towards a more tremendous revolution in\r\nthe appliances of civilisation, a more far-reaching alteration in the\r\nways of humanity than has ever been effected since history began.\r\nThey did not even take him seriously. In a little while he would be\r\nproverbial. \"I _must_ fly now,\" he said on his way home, smarting with\r\na sense of absolute social failure. \"I must fly soon. If it doesn't\r\ncome off soon, by God! I shall run amuck.\"\r\n\r\nHe said that before he had gone through his pass-book and his litter of\r\npapers. Inadequate as the cause seems, it was that girl's voice and the\r\nexpression of her eyes that precipitated his discontent. But certainly\r\nthe discovery that he had no longer even one hundred thousand pounds'\r\nworth of realisable property behind him was the poison that made the\r\nwound deadly.\r\n\r\nIt was the next day after this that he exploded upon Woodhouse and\r\nhis workmen, and thereafter his bearing was consistently grim for\r\nthree weeks, and anxiety dwelt in Cheam and Ewell, Malden, Morden, and\r\nWorcester Park, places that had thriven mightily on his experiments.\r\n\r\nFour weeks after that first swearing of his, he stood with Woodhouse\r\nby the reconstructed machine as it lay across the elevated railway,\r\nby means of which it gained its initial impetus. The new propeller\r\nglittered a brighter white than the rest of the machine, and a gilder,\r\nobedient to a whim of Monson's, was picking out the aluminium bars\r\nwith gold. And looking down the long avenue between the ropes (gilded\r\nnow with the sunset), one saw red signals, and two miles away an\r\nant-hill of workmen busy altering the last falls of the run into a\r\nrising slope.\r\n\r\n\"I'll _come_,\" said Woodhouse. \"I'll come right enough. But I tell you\r\nit's infernally foolhardy. If only you would give another year\"--\r\n\r\n\"I tell you I won't. I tell you the thing works. I've given years\r\nenough\"--\r\n\r\n\"It's not that,\" said Woodhouse. \"We're all right with the machine. But\r\nit's the steering\"--\r\n\r\n\"Haven't I been rushing, night and morning, backwards and forwards,\r\nthrough this squirrel's cage? If the thing steers true here, it will\r\nsteer true all across England. It's just funk, I tell you, Woodhouse.\r\nWe could have gone a year ago. And besides\"--\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" said Woodhouse.\r\n\r\n\"The money!\" snapped Monson over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Hang it! I never thought of the money,\" said Woodhouse, and then,\r\nspeaking now in a very different tone to that with which he had said\r\nthe words before, he repeated, \"I'll come. Trust me.\"\r\n\r\nMonson turned suddenly, and saw all that Woodhouse had not the\r\ndexterity to say, shining on his sunset-lit face. He looked for a\r\nmoment, then impulsively extended his hand. \"Thanks,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Woodhouse, gripping the hand, and with a queer\r\nsoftening of his features. \"Trust me.\"\r\n\r\nThen both men turned to the big apparatus that lay with its flat wings\r\nextended upon the carrier, and stared at it meditatively. Monson,\r\nguided perhaps by a photographic study of the flight of birds, and by\r\nLilienthal's methods, had gradually drifted from Maxim's shapes towards\r\nthe bird form again. The thing, however, was driven by a huge screw\r\nbehind in the place of the tail; and so hovering, which needs an almost\r\nvertical adjustment of a flat tail, was rendered impossible. The body\r\nof the machine was small, almost cylindrical, and pointed. Forward and\r\naft on the pointed ends were two small petroleum engines for the screw,\r\nand the navigators sat deep in a canoe-like recess, the foremost one\r\nsteering, and being protected by a low screen, with two plate-glass\r\nwindows, from the blinding rush of air. On either side a monstrous flat\r\nframework with a curved front border could be adjusted so as either to\r\nlie horizontally, or to be tilted upward or down. These wings worked\r\nrigidly together, or, by releasing a pin, one could be tilted through\r\na small angle independently of its fellow. The front edge of either\r\nwing could also be shifted back so as to diminish the wing-area about\r\none-sixth. The machine was not only not designed to hover, but it was\r\nalso incapable of fluttering. Monson's idea was to get into the air\r\nwith the initial rush of the apparatus, and then to skim, much as a\r\nplaying-card may be skimmed, keeping up the rush by means of the screw\r\nat the stern. Rooks and gulls fly enormous distances in that way with\r\nscarcely a perceptible movement of the wings. The bird really drives\r\nalong on an aërial switchback. It glides slanting downward for a\r\nspace, until it has gained considerable momentum, and then altering\r\nthe inclination of its wings, glides up again almost to its original\r\naltitude. Even a Londoner who has watched the birds in the aviary in\r\nRegent's Park knows that.\r\n\r\nBut the bird is practising this art from the moment it leaves its nest.\r\nIt has not only the perfect apparatus, but the perfect instinct to\r\nuse it. A man off his feet has the poorest skill in balancing. Even\r\nthe simple trick of the bicycle costs him some hours of labour. The\r\ninstantaneous adjustments of the wings, the quick response to a passing\r\nbreeze, the swift recovery of equilibrium, the giddy, eddying movements\r\nthat require such absolute precision--all that he must learn, learn\r\nwith infinite labour and infinite danger, if ever he is to conquer\r\nflying. The flying-machine that will start off some fine day, driven\r\nby neat \"little levers,\" with a nice open deck like a liner, and all\r\nloaded up with bombshells and guns, is the easy dreaming of a literary\r\nman. In lives and in treasure the cost of the conquest of the empire of\r\nthe air may even exceed all that has been spent in man's great conquest\r\nof the sea. Certainly it will be costlier than the greatest war that\r\nhas ever devastated the world.\r\n\r\nNo one knew these things better than these two practical men. And they\r\nknew they were in the front rank of the coming army. Yet there is\r\nhope even in a forlorn hope. Men are killed outright in the reserves\r\nsometimes, while others who have been left for dead in the thickest\r\ncorner crawl out and survive.\r\n\r\n\"If we miss these meadows\"--said Woodhouse presently in his slow way.\r\n\r\n\"My dear chap,\" said Monson, whose spirits had been rising fitfully\r\nduring the last few days, \"we mustn't miss these meadows. There's\r\na quarter of a square mile for us to hit, fences removed, ditches\r\nlevelled. We shall come down all right--rest assured. And if we don't\"--\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said Woodhouse. \"If we don't!\"\r\n\r\nBefore the day of the start, the newspaper people got wind of the\r\nalterations at the northward end of the framework, and Monson was\r\ncheered by a decided change in the comments Romeike forwarded him. \"He\r\nwill be off some day,\" said the papers. \"He will be off some day,\"\r\nsaid the South-Western season-ticket holders one to another; the\r\nseaside excursionists, the Saturday-to-Monday trippers from Sussex\r\nand Hampshire and Dorset and Devon, the eminent literary people from\r\nHazlemere, all remarked eagerly one to another, \"He will be off\r\nsome day,\" as the familiar scaffolding came in sight. And actually,\r\none bright morning, in full view of the ten-past-ten train from\r\nBasingstoke, Monson's flying-machine started on its journey.\r\n\r\nThey saw the carrier running swiftly along its rail, and the white and\r\ngold screw spinning in the air. They heard the rapid rumble of wheels,\r\nand a thud as the carrier reached the buffers at the end of its run.\r\nThen a whirr as the Flying-Machine was shot forward into the networks.\r\nAll that the majority of them had seen and heard before. The thing went\r\nwith a drooping flight through the framework and rose again, and then\r\nevery beholder shouted, or screamed, or yelled, or shrieked after his\r\nkind. For instead of the customary concussion and stoppage, the Flying\r\nMachine flew out of its five years' cage like a bolt from a crossbow,\r\nand drove slantingly upward into the air, curved round a little, so as\r\nto cross the line, and soared in the direction of Wimbledon Common.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to hang momentarily in the air and grow smaller, then it\r\nducked and vanished over the clustering blue tree-tops to the east of\r\nCoombe Hill, and no one stopped staring and gasping until long after it\r\nhad disappeared.\r\n\r\nThat was what the people in the train from Basingstoke saw. If you had\r\ndrawn a line down the middle of that train, from engine to guard's\r\nvan, you would not have found a living soul on the opposite side to\r\nthe flying-machine. It was a mad rush from window to window as the\r\nthing crossed the line. And the engine-driver and stoker never took\r\ntheir eyes off the low hills about Wimbledon, and never noticed that\r\nthey had run clean through Coombe and Maiden and Raynes Park, until,\r\nwith returning animation, they found themselves pelting, at the most\r\nindecent pace, into Wimbledon station.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment when Monson had started the carrier with a \"_Now!_\"\r\nneither he nor Woodhouse said a word. Both men sat with clenched\r\nteeth. Monson had crossed the line with a curve that was too sharp,\r\nand Woodhouse had opened and shut his white lips; but neither spoke.\r\nWoodhouse simply gripped his seat, and breathed sharply through his\r\nteeth, watching the blue country to the west rushing past, and down,\r\nand away from him. Monson knelt at his post forward, and his hands\r\ntrembled on the spoked wheel that moved the wings. He could see\r\nnothing before him but a mass of white clouds in the sky.\r\n\r\nThe machine went slanting upward, travelling with an enormous speed\r\nstill, but losing momentum every moment. The land ran away underneath\r\nwith diminishing speed.\r\n\r\n\"_Now!_\" said Woodhouse at last, and with a violent effort Monson\r\nwrenched over the wheel and altered the angle of the wings. The machine\r\nseemed to hang for half a minute motionless in mid-air, and then he\r\nsaw the hazy blue house-covered hills of Kilburn and Hampstead jump\r\nup before his eyes and rise steadily, until the little sunlit dome of\r\nthe Albert Hall appeared through his windows. For a moment he scarcely\r\nunderstood the meaning of this upward rush of the horizon, but as the\r\nnearer and nearer houses came into view, he realised what he had done.\r\nHe had turned the wings over too far, and they were swooping steeply\r\ndownward towards the Thames.\r\n\r\nThe thought, the question, the realisation were all the business of a\r\nsecond of time. \"Too much!\" gasped Woodhouse. Monson brought the wheel\r\nhalf-way back with a jerk, and forthwith the Kilburn and Hampstead\r\nridge dropped again to the lower edge of his windows. They had been\r\na thousand feet above Coombe and Maiden station; fifty seconds after\r\nthey whizzed, at a frightful pace, not eighty feet above the East\r\nPutney station, on the Metropolitan District line, to the screaming\r\nastonishment of a platformful of people. Monson flung up the vans\r\nagainst the air, and over Fulham they rushed up their atmospheric\r\nswitchback again, steeply--too steeply. The 'buses went floundering\r\nacross the Fulham Road, the people yelled.\r\n\r\nThen down again, too steeply still, and the distant trees and houses\r\nabout Primrose Hill leapt up across Monson's window, and then suddenly\r\nhe saw straight before him the greenery of Kensington Gardens and the\r\ntowers of the Imperial Institute. They were driving straight down upon\r\nSouth Kensington. The pinnacles of the Natural History Museum rushed up\r\ninto view. There came one fatal second of swift thought, a moment of\r\nhesitation. Should he try and clear the towers, or swerve eastward?\r\n\r\nHe made a hesitating attempt to release the right wing, left the catch\r\nhalf released, and gave a frantic clutch at the wheel.\r\n\r\nThe nose of the machine seemed to leap up before him. The wheel pressed\r\nhis hand with irresistible force, and jerked itself out of his control.\r\n\r\nWoodhouse, sitting crouched together, gave a hoarse cry, and sprang up\r\ntowards Monson. \"Too far!\" he cried, and then he was clinging to the\r\ngunwale for dear life, and Monson had been jerked clean overhead, and\r\nwas falling backwards upon him.\r\n\r\nSo swiftly had the thing happened that barely a quarter of the people\r\ngoing to and fro in Hyde Park, and Brompton Road, and the Exhibition\r\nRoad saw anything of the aërial catastrophe. A distant winged shape\r\nhad appeared above the clustering houses to the south, had fallen\r\nand risen, growing larger as it did so; had swooped swiftly down\r\ntowards the Imperial Institute, a broad spread of flying wings, had\r\nswept round in a quarter circle, dashed eastward, and then suddenly\r\nsprang vertically into the air. A black object shot out of it, and\r\ncame spinning downward. A man! Two men clutching each other! They came\r\nwhirling down, separated as they struck the roof of the Students' Club,\r\nand bounded off into the green bushes on its southward side.\r\n\r\nFor perhaps half a minute, the pointed stem of the big machine still\r\npierced vertically upward, the screw spinning desperately. For one\r\nbrief instant, that yet seemed an age to all who watched, it had hung\r\nmotionless in mid-air. Then a spout of yellow flame licked up its\r\nlength from the stern engine, and swift, swifter, swifter, and flaring\r\nlike a rocket, it rushed down upon the solid mass of masonry which was\r\nformerly the Royal College of Science. The big screw of white and gold\r\ntouched the parapet, and crumpled up like wet linen. Then the blazing\r\nspindle-shaped body smashed and splintered, smashing and splintering in\r\nits fall, upon the north-westward angle of the building.\r\n\r\nBut the crash, the flame of blazing paraffin that shot heavenward from\r\nthe shattered engines of the machine, the crushed horrors that were\r\nfound in the garden beyond the Students' Club, the masses of yellow\r\nparapet and red brick that fell headlong into the roadway, the running\r\nto and fro of people like ants in a broken ant-hill, the galloping of\r\nfire-engines, the gathering of crowds--all these things do not belong\r\nto this story, which was written only to tell how the first of all\r\nsuccessful flying-machines was launched and flew. Though he failed, and\r\nfailed disastrously, the record of Monson's work remains--a sufficient\r\nmonument--to guide the next of that band of gallant experimentalists\r\nwho will sooner or later master this great problem of flying. And\r\nbetween Worcester Park and Malden there still stands that portentous\r\navenue of iron-work, rusting now, and dangerous here and there, to\r\nwitness to the first desperate struggle for man's right of way through\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF THE LATE MR. ELVESHAM\r\n\r\n\r\nI set this story down, not expecting it will be believed, but, if\r\npossible, to prepare a way of escape for the next victim. He, perhaps,\r\nmay profit by my misfortune. My own case, I know, is hopeless, and I am\r\nnow in some measure prepared to meet my fate.\r\n\r\nMy name is Edward George Eden. I was born at Trentham, in Staffordshire,\r\nmy father being employed in the gardens there. I lost my mother when\r\nI was three years old, and my father when I was five, my uncle,\r\nGeorge Eden, then adopting me as his own son. He was a single man,\r\nself-educated, and well-known in Birmingham as an enterprising\r\njournalist; he educated me generously, fired my ambition to succeed\r\nin the world, and at his death, which happened four years ago, left\r\nme his entire fortune, a matter of about five hundred pounds after\r\nall outgoing charges were paid. I was then eighteen. He advised me\r\nin his will to expend the money in completing my education. I had\r\nalready chosen the profession of medicine, and through his posthumous\r\ngenerosity, and my good fortune in a scholarship competition, I became\r\na medical student at University College, London. At the time of the\r\nbeginning of my story I lodged at 11A University Street, in a little\r\nupper room, very shabbily furnished, and draughty, overlooking the back\r\nof Shoolbred's premises. I used this little room both to live in and\r\nsleep in, because I was anxious to eke out my means to the very last\r\nshillingsworth.\r\n\r\nI was taking a pair of shoes to be mended at a shop in the Tottenham\r\nCourt Road when I first encountered the little old man with the yellow\r\nface, with whom my life has now become so inextricably entangled. He\r\nwas standing on the kerb, and staring at the number on the door in\r\na doubtful way, as I opened it. His eyes--they were dull grey eyes,\r\nand reddish under the rims--fell to my face, and his countenance\r\nimmediately assumed an expression of corrugated amiability.\r\n\r\n\"You come,\" he said, \"apt to the moment. I had forgotten the number of\r\nyour house. How do you do, Mr. Eden?\"\r\n\r\nI was a little astonished at his familiar address, for I had never set\r\neyes on the man before. I was a little annoyed, too, at his catching me\r\nwith my boots under my arm. He noticed my lack of cordiality.\r\n\r\n\"Wonder who the deuce I am, eh? A friend, let me assure you. I have\r\nseen you before, though you haven't seen me. Is there anywhere where I\r\ncan talk to you?\"\r\n\r\nI hesitated. The shabbiness of my room upstairs was not a matter for\r\nevery stranger. \"Perhaps,\" said I, \"we might walk down the street. I'm\r\nunfortunately prevented\"--My gesture explained the sentence before I\r\nhad spoken it.\r\n\r\n\"The very thing,\" he said, and faced this way and then that. \"The\r\nstreet? Which way shall we go?\" I slipped my boots down in the passage.\r\n\"Look here!\" he said abruptly; \"this business of mine is a rigmarole.\r\nCome and lunch with me, Mr. Eden. I'm an old man, a very old man, and\r\nnot good at explanations, and what with my piping voice and the clatter\r\nof the traffic\"--\r\n\r\nHe laid a persuasive skinny hand that trembled a little upon my arm.\r\n\r\nI was not so old that an old man might not treat me to a lunch. Yet at\r\nthe same time I was not altogether pleased by this abrupt invitation.\r\n\"I had rather\"--I began. \"But _I_ had rather,\" he said, catching me\r\nup, \"and a certain civility is surely due to my grey hairs.\" And so I\r\nconsented, and went with him.\r\n\r\nHe took me to Blavitski's; I had to walk slowly to accommodate myself\r\nto his paces; and over such a lunch as I had never tasted before,\r\nhe fended off my leading questions, and I took a better note of his\r\nappearance. His clean-shaven face was lean and wrinkled, his shrivelled\r\nlips fell over a set of false teeth, and his white hair was thin and\r\nrather long; he seemed small to me,--though, indeed, most people seemed\r\nsmall to me,--and his shoulders were rounded and bent. And watching\r\nhim, I could not help but observe that he too was taking note of me,\r\nrunning his eyes, with a curious touch of greed in them, over me, from\r\nmy broad shoulders to my sun-tanned hands, and up to my freckled face\r\nagain. \"And now,\" said he, as we lit our cigarettes, \"I must tell you\r\nof the business in hand.\r\n\r\n\"I must tell you, then, that I am an old man, a very old man.\" He\r\npaused momentarily. \"And it happens that I have money that I must\r\npresently be leaving, and never a child have I to leave it to.\" I\r\nthought of the confidence trick, and resolved I would be on the alert\r\nfor the vestiges of my five hundred pounds. He proceeded to enlarge on\r\nhis loneliness, and the trouble he had to find a proper disposition\r\nof his money. \"I have weighed this plan and that plan, charities,\r\ninstitutions, and scholarships, and libraries, and I have come to this\r\nconclusion at last,\"--he fixed his eyes on my face,--\"that I will find\r\nsome young fellow, ambitious, pure-minded, and poor, healthy in body\r\nand healthy in mind, and, in short, make him my heir, give him all\r\nthat I have.\" He repeated, \"Give him all that I have. So that he will\r\nsuddenly be lifted out of all the trouble and struggle in which his\r\nsympathies have been educated, to freedom and influence.\"\r\n\r\nI tried to seem disinterested. With a transparent hypocrisy, I said,\r\n\"And you want my help, my professional services, maybe, to find that\r\nperson.\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled, and looked at me over his cigarette, and I laughed at his\r\nquiet exposure of my modest pretence.\r\n\r\n\"What a career such a man might have!\" he said. \"It fills me with envy\r\nto think how I have accumulated that another man may spend--\r\n\r\n\"But there are conditions, of course, burdens to be imposed. He must,\r\nfor instance, take my name. You cannot expect everything without some\r\nreturn. And I must go into all the circumstances of his life before I\r\ncan accept him. He _must_ be sound. I must know his heredity, how his\r\nparents and grandparents died, have the strictest inquiries made into\r\nhis private morals\"--\r\n\r\nThis modified my secret congratulations a little. \"And do I understand,\"\r\nsaid I, \"that I--?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said, almost fiercely. \"You. _You._\"\r\n\r\nI answered never a word. My imagination was dancing wildly, my innate\r\nscepticism was useless to modify its transports. There was not a\r\nparticle of gratitude in my mind--I did not know what to say nor how to\r\nsay it. \"But why me in particular?\" I said at last.\r\n\r\nHe had chanced to hear of me from Professor Haslar, he said, as a\r\ntypically sound and sane young man, and he wished, as far as possible,\r\nto leave his money where health and integrity were assured.\r\n\r\nThat was my first meeting with the little old man. He was mysterious\r\nabout himself; he would not give his name yet, he said, and after I had\r\nanswered some questions of his, he left me at the Blavitski portal.\r\nI noticed that he drew a handful of gold coins from his pocket when\r\nit came to paying for the lunch. His insistence upon bodily health\r\nwas curious. In accordance with an arrangement we had made I applied\r\nthat day for a life policy in the Loyal Insurance Company for a large\r\nsum, and I was exhaustively overhauled by the medical advisers of that\r\ncompany in the subsequent week. Even that did not satisfy him, and he\r\ninsisted I must be re-examined by the great Doctor Henderson. It was\r\nFriday in Whitsun week before he came to a decision. He called me\r\ndown, quite late in the evening,--nearly nine it was,--from cramming\r\nchemical equations for my Preliminary Scientific examination. He was\r\nstanding in the passage under the feeble gas-lamp, and his face was a\r\ngrotesque interplay of shadows. He seemed more bowed than when I had\r\nfirst seen him, and his cheeks had sunk in a little.\r\n\r\nHis voice shook with emotion. \"Everything is satisfactory, Mr. Eden,\"\r\nhe said. \"Everything is quite, quite satisfactory. And this night of\r\nall nights, you must dine with me and celebrate your--accession.\" He\r\nwas interrupted by a cough. \"You won't have long to wait, either,\" he\r\nsaid, wiping his handkerchief across his lips, and gripping my hand\r\nwith his long bony claw that was disengaged. \"Certainly not very long\r\nto wait.\"\r\n\r\nWe went into the street and called a cab. I remember every incident of\r\nthat drive vividly, the swift, easy motion, the vivid contrast of gas\r\nand oil and electric light, the crowds of people in the streets, the\r\nplace in Regent Street to which we went, and the sumptuous dinner we\r\nwere served with there. I was disconcerted at first by the well-dressed\r\nwaiter's glances at my rough clothes, bothered by the stones of the\r\nolives, but as the champagne warmed my blood, my confidence revived. At\r\nfirst the old man talked of himself. He had already told me his name in\r\nthe cab; he was Egbert Elvesham, the great philosopher, whose name I\r\nhad known since I was a lad at school. It seemed incredible to me that\r\nthis man, whose intelligence had so early dominated mine, this great\r\nabstraction, should suddenly realise itself as this decrepit, familiar\r\nfigure. I daresay every young fellow who has suddenly fallen among\r\ncelebrities has felt something of my disappointment. He told me now of\r\nthe future that the feeble streams of his life would presently leave\r\ndry for me, houses, copyrights, investments; I had never suspected that\r\nphilosophers were so rich. He watched me drink and eat with a touch of\r\nenvy. \"What a capacity for living you have!\" he said; and then, with a\r\nsigh, a sigh of relief I could have thought it, \"It will not be long.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay,\" said I, my head swimming now with champagne; \"I have a future\r\nperhaps--of a passing agreeable sort, thanks to you. I shall now have\r\nthe honour of your name. But you have a past. Such a past as is worth\r\nall my future.\"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head and smiled, as I thought, with half-sad appreciation\r\nof my flattering admiration. \"That future,\" he said, \"would you\r\nin truth change it?\" The waiter came with liqueurs. \"You will not\r\nperhaps mind taking my name, taking my position, but would you\r\nindeed--willingly--take my years?\"\r\n\r\n\"With your achievements,\" said I gallantly.\r\n\r\nHe smiled again. \"Kummel--both,\" he said to the waiter, and turned\r\nhis attention to a little paper packet he had taken from his pocket.\r\n\"This hour,\" said he, \"this after-dinner hour is the hour of small\r\nthings. Here is a scrap of my unpublished wisdom.\" He opened the packet\r\nwith his shaking yellow fingers, and showed a little pinkish powder\r\non the paper. \"This,\" said he--\"well, you must guess what it is. But\r\nKummel--put but a dash of this powder in it--is Himmel.\" His large\r\ngreyish eyes watched mine with an inscrutable expression.\r\n\r\nIt was a bit of a shock to me to find this great teacher gave his mind\r\nto the flavour of liqueurs. However, I feigned a great interest in his\r\nweakness, for I was drunk enough for such small sycophancy.\r\n\r\nHe parted the powder between the little glasses, and, rising suddenly,\r\nwith a strange unexpected dignity, held out his hand towards me. I\r\nimitated his action, and the glasses rang. \"To a quick succession,\"\r\nsaid he, and raised his glass towards his lips.\r\n\r\n\"Not that,\" I said hastily. \"Not that.\"\r\n\r\nHe paused, with the liqueur at the level of his chin, and his eyes\r\nblazing into mine.\r\n\r\n\"To a long life,\" said I.\r\n\r\nHe hesitated. \"To a long life,\" said he, with a sudden bark of\r\nlaughter, and with eyes fixed on one another we tilted the little\r\nglasses. His eyes looked straight into mine, and as I drained the stuff\r\noff, I felt a curiously intense sensation. The first touch of it set my\r\nbrain in a furious tumult; I seemed to feel an actual physical stirring\r\nin my skull, and a seething humming filled my ears. I did not notice\r\nthe flavour in my mouth, the aroma that filled my throat; I saw only\r\nthe grey intensity of his gaze that burnt into mine. The draught, the\r\nmental confusion, the noise and stirring in my head, seemed to last an\r\ninterminable time. Curious vague impressions of half-forgotten things\r\ndanced and vanished on the edge of my consciousness. At last he broke\r\nthe spell. With a sudden explosive sigh he put down his glass.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"It's glorious,\" said I, though I had not tasted the stuff.\r\n\r\nMy head was spinning. I sat down. My brain was chaos. Then my\r\nperception grew clear and minute as though I saw things in a concave\r\nmirror. His manner seemed to have changed into something nervous and\r\nhasty. He pulled out his watch and grimaced at it. \"Eleven-seven! And\r\nto-night I must--Seven--twenty-five. Waterloo! I must go at once.\" He\r\ncalled for the bill, and struggled with his coat. Officious waiters\r\ncame to our assistance. In another moment I was wishing him good-bye,\r\nover the apron of a cab, and still with an absurd feeling of minute\r\ndistinctness, as though--how can I express it?--I not only saw but\r\n_felt_ through an inverted opera-glass.\r\n\r\n\"That stuff,\" he said. He put his hand to his forehead. \"I ought not\r\nto have given it to you. It will make your head split to-morrow.\r\nWait a minute. Here.\" He handed me out a little flat thing like a\r\nseidlitz-powder. \"Take that in water as you are going to bed. The other\r\nthing was a drug. Not till you're ready to go to bed, mind. It will\r\nclear your head. That's all. One more shake--Futurus!\"\r\n\r\nI gripped his shrivelled claw. \"Good-bye,\" he said, and by the droop of\r\nhis eyelids I judged he too was a little under the influence of that\r\nbrain-twisting cordial.\r\n\r\nHe recollected something else with a start, felt in his breast-pocket,\r\nand produced another packet, this time a cylinder the size and shape of\r\na shaving-stick. \"Here,\" said he. \"I'd almost forgotten. Don't open\r\nthis until I come to-morrow--but take it now.\"\r\n\r\nIt was so heavy that I well-nigh dropped it. \"All ri'!\" said I, and he\r\ngrinned at me through the cab window as the cabman flicked his horse\r\ninto wakefulness. It was a white packet he had given me, with red seals\r\nat either end and along its edge. \"If this isn't money,\" said I, \"it's\r\nplatinum or lead.\"\r\n\r\nI stuck it with elaborate care into my pocket, and with a whirling\r\nbrain walked home through the Regent Street loiterers and the dark\r\nback streets beyond Portland Road. I remember the sensations of that\r\nwalk very vividly, strange as they were. I was still so far myself\r\nthat I could notice my strange mental state, and wonder whether this\r\nstuff I had had was opium--a drug beyond my experience. It is hard now\r\nto describe the peculiarity of my mental strangeness--mental doubling\r\nvaguely expresses it. As I was walking up Regent Street I found in my\r\nmind a queer persuasion that it was Waterloo station, and had an odd\r\nimpulse to get into the Polytechnic as a man might get into a train. I\r\nput a knuckle in my eye, and it was Regent Street. How can I express\r\nit? You see a skilful actor looking quietly at you, he pulls a grimace,\r\nand lo!--another person. Is it too extravagant if I tell you that it\r\nseemed to me as if Regent Street had, for the moment, done that? Then,\r\nbeing persuaded it was Regent Street again, I was oddly muddled about\r\nsome fantastic reminiscences that cropped up. \"Thirty years ago,\"\r\nthought I, \"it was here that I quarrelled with my brother.\" Then I\r\nburst out laughing, to the astonishment and encouragement of a group of\r\nnight prowlers. Thirty years ago I did not exist, and never in my life\r\nhad I boasted a brother. The stuff was surely liquid folly, for the\r\npoignant regret for that lost brother still clung to me. Along Portland\r\nRoad the madness took another turn. I began to recall vanished shops,\r\nand to compare the street with what it used to be. Confused, troubled\r\nthinking is comprehensible enough after the drink I had taken, but what\r\npuzzled me were these curiously vivid phantasm memories that had crept\r\ninto my mind, and not only the memories that had crept in, but also\r\nthe memories that had slipped out. I stopped opposite Stevens', the\r\nnatural history dealer's, and cudgelled my brains to think what he had\r\nto do with me. A 'bus went by, and sounded exactly like the rumbling\r\nof a train. I seemed to be dipped into some dark, remote pit for the\r\nrecollection. \"Of course,\" said I, at last, \"he has promised me three\r\nfrogs to-morrow. Odd I should have forgotten.\"\r\n\r\nDo they still show children dissolving views? In those I remember one\r\nview would begin like a faint ghost, and grow and oust another. In\r\njust that way it seemed to me that a ghostly set of new sensations was\r\nstruggling with those of my ordinary self.\r\n\r\nI went on through Euston Road to Tottenham Court Road, puzzled, and a\r\nlittle frightened, and scarcely noticed the unusual way I was taking,\r\nfor commonly I used to cut through the intervening network of back\r\nstreets. I turned into University Street, to discover that I had\r\nforgotten my number. Only by a strong effort did I recall 11A, and\r\neven then it seemed to me that it was a thing some forgotten person\r\nhad told me. I tried to steady my mind by recalling the incidents of\r\nthe dinner, and for the life of me I could conjure up no picture of\r\nmy host's face; I saw him only as a shadowy outline, as one might see\r\noneself reflected in a window through which one was looking. In his\r\nplace, however, I had a curious exterior vision of myself sitting at a\r\ntable, flushed, bright-eyed, and talkative.\r\n\r\n\"I must take this other powder,\" said I. \"This is getting impossible.\"\r\n\r\nI tried the wrong side of the hall for my candle and the matches, and\r\nhad a doubt of which landing my room might be on. \"I'm drunk,\" I said,\r\n\"that's certain,\" and blundered needlessly on the staircase to sustain\r\nthe proposition.\r\n\r\nAt the first glance my room seemed unfamiliar. \"What rot!\" I said, and\r\nstared about me. I seemed to bring myself back by the effort, and the\r\nodd phantasmal quality passed into the concrete familiar. There was the\r\nold glass still, with my notes on the albumens stuck in the corner of\r\nthe frame, my old everyday suit of clothes pitched about the floor. And\r\nyet it was not so real after all. I felt an idiotic persuasion trying\r\nto creep into my mind, as it were, that I was in a railway carriage in\r\na train just stopping, that I was peering out of the window at some\r\nunknown station. I gripped the bed-rail firmly to reassure myself.\r\n\"It's clairvoyance, perhaps,\" I said. \"I must write to the Psychical\r\nResearch Society.\"\r\n\r\nI put the rouleau on my dressing-table, sat on my bed and began to\r\ntake off my boots. It was as if the picture of my present sensations\r\nwas painted over some other picture that was trying to show through.\r\n\"Curse it!\" said I; \"my wits are going, or am I in two places at once?\"\r\nHalf-undressed, I tossed the powder into a glass and drank it off. It\r\neffervesced, and became a fluorescent amber colour. Before I was in bed\r\nmy mind was already tranquillised. I felt the pillow at my cheek, and\r\nthereupon I must have fallen asleep.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI awoke abruptly out of a dream of strange beasts, and found myself\r\nlying on my back. Probably everyone knows that dismal, emotional dream\r\nfrom which one escapes, awake indeed, but strangely cowed. There was\r\na curious taste in my mouth, a tired feeling in my limbs, a sense of\r\ncutaneous discomfort. I lay with my head motionless on my pillow,\r\nexpecting that my feeling of strangeness and terror would probably\r\npass away, and that I should then doze off again to sleep. But instead\r\nof that, my uncanny sensations increased. At first I could perceive\r\nnothing wrong about me. There was a faint light in the room, so faint\r\nthat it was the very next thing to darkness, and the furniture stood\r\nout in it as vague blots of absolute darkness. I stared with my eyes\r\njust over the bedclothes.\r\n\r\nIt came into my mind that someone had entered the room to rob me of my\r\nrouleau of money, but after lying for some moments, breathing regularly\r\nto simulate sleep, I realised this was mere fancy. Nevertheless, the\r\nuneasy assurance of something wrong kept fast hold of me. With an\r\neffort I raised my head from the pillow, and peered about me at the\r\ndark. What it was I could not conceive. I looked at the dim shapes\r\naround me, the greater and lesser darknesses that indicated curtains,\r\ntable, fireplace, bookshelves, and so forth. Then I began to perceive\r\nsomething unfamiliar in the forms of the darkness. Had the bed turned\r\nround? Yonder should be the bookshelves, and something shrouded and\r\npallid rose there, something that would not answer to the bookshelves,\r\nhowever I looked at it. It was far too big to be my shirt thrown on a\r\nchair.\r\n\r\nOvercoming a childish terror, I threw back the bedclothes and thrust my\r\nleg out of bed. Instead of coming out of my truckle-bed upon the floor,\r\nI found my foot scarcely reached the edge of the mattress. I made\r\nanother step, as it were, and sat up on the edge of the bed. By the\r\nside of my bed should be the candle, and the matches upon the broken\r\nchair. I put out my hand and touched--nothing. I waved my hand in the\r\ndarkness, and it came against some heavy hanging, soft and thick in\r\ntexture, which gave a rustling noise at my touch. I grasped this and\r\npulled it; it appeared to be a curtain suspended over the head of my\r\nbed.\r\n\r\nI was now thoroughly awake, and beginning to realise that I was\r\nin a strange room. I was puzzled. I tried to recall the overnight\r\ncircumstances, and I found them now, curiously enough, vivid in my\r\nmemory: the supper, my reception of the little packages, my wonder\r\nwhether I was intoxicated, my slow undressing, the coolness to my\r\nflushed face of my pillow. I felt a sudden distrust. Was that last\r\nnight, or the night before? At anyrate, this room was strange to\r\nme, and I could not imagine how I had got into it. The dim, pallid\r\noutline was growing paler, and I perceived it was a window, with the\r\ndark shape of an oval toilet-glass against the weak intimation of the\r\ndawn that filtered through the blind. I stood up, and was surprised\r\nby a curious feeling of weakness and unsteadiness. With trembling\r\nhands outstretched, I walked slowly towards the window, getting,\r\nnevertheless, a bruise on the knee from a chair by the way. I fumbled\r\nround the glass, which was large, with handsome brass sconces, to find\r\nthe blind-cord. I could not find any. By chance I took hold of the\r\ntassel, and with the click of a spring the blind ran up.\r\n\r\nI found myself looking out upon a scene that was altogether strange\r\nto me. The night was overcast, and through the flocculent grey of\r\nthe heaped clouds there filtered a faint half-light of dawn. Just at\r\nthe edge of the sky, the cloud-canopy had a blood-red rim. Below,\r\neverything was dark and indistinct, dim hills in the distance, a vague\r\nmass of buildings running up into pinnacles, trees like spilt ink, and\r\nbelow the window a tracery of black bushes and pale grey paths. It was\r\nso unfamiliar that for the moment I thought myself still dreaming. I\r\nfelt the toilet-table; it appeared to be made of some polished wood,\r\nand was rather elaborately furnished--there were little cut-glass\r\nbottles and a brush upon it. There was also a queer little object,\r\nhorse-shoe-shaped it felt, with smooth, hard projections, lying in a\r\nsaucer. I could find no matches nor candlestick.\r\n\r\nI turned my eyes to the room again. Now the blind was up, faint\r\nspectres of its furnishing came out of the darkness. There was a huge\r\ncurtained bed, and the fireplace at its foot had a large white mantel\r\nwith something of the shimmer of marble.\r\n\r\nI leant against the toilet-table, shut my eyes and opened them again,\r\nand tried to think. The whole thing was far too real for dreaming. I\r\nwas inclined to imagine there was still some hiatus in my memory, as a\r\nconsequence of my draught of that strange liqueur; that I had come into\r\nmy inheritance perhaps, and suddenly lost my recollection of everything\r\nsince my good fortune had been announced. Perhaps if I waited a little,\r\nthings would be clearer to me again. Yet my dinner with old Elvesham\r\nwas now singularly vivid and recent. The champagne, the observant\r\nwaiters, the powder, and the liqueurs--I could have staked my soul it\r\nall happened a few hours ago.\r\n\r\nAnd then occurred a thing so trivial and yet so terrible to me that I\r\nshiver now to think of that moment. I spoke aloud. I said, \"How the\r\ndevil did I get here?\" ... _And the voice was not my own._\r\n\r\nIt was not my own, it was thin, the articulation was slurred, the\r\nresonance of my facial bones was different. Then, to reassure myself\r\nI ran one hand over the other, and felt loose folds of skin, the\r\nbony laxity of age. \"Surely,\" I said, in that horrible voice that\r\nhad somehow established itself in my throat, \"surely this thing is a\r\ndream!\" Almost as quickly as if I did it involuntarily, I thrust my\r\nfingers into my mouth. My teeth had gone. My finger-tips ran on the\r\nflaccid surface of an even row of shrivelled gums. I was sick with\r\ndismay and disgust.\r\n\r\nI felt then a passionate desire to see myself, to realise at once in\r\nits full horror the ghastly change that had come upon me. I tottered to\r\nthe mantel, and felt along it for matches. As I did so, a barking cough\r\nsprang up in my throat, and I clutched the thick flannel nightdress I\r\nfound about me. There were no matches there, and I suddenly realised\r\nthat my extremities were cold. Sniffing and coughing, whimpering a\r\nlittle, perhaps, I fumbled back to bed. \"It is surely a dream,\" I\r\nwhimpered to myself as I clambered back, \"surely a dream.\" It was a\r\nsenile repetition. I pulled the bedclothes over my shoulders, over my\r\nears, I thrust my withered hand under the pillow, and determined to\r\ncompose myself to sleep. Of course it was a dream. In the morning the\r\ndream would be over, and I should wake up strong and vigorous again to\r\nmy youth and studies. I shut my eyes, breathed regularly, and, finding\r\nmyself wakeful, began to count slowly through the powers of three.\r\n\r\nBut the thing I desired would not come. I could not get to sleep.\r\nAnd the persuasion of the inexorable reality of the change that had\r\nhappened to me grew steadily. Presently I found myself with my eyes\r\nwide open, the powers of three forgotten, and my skinny fingers upon\r\nmy shrivelled gums. I was, indeed, suddenly and abruptly, an old man.\r\nI had in some unaccountable manner fallen through my life and come to\r\nold age, in some way I had been cheated of all the best of my life, of\r\nlove, of struggle, of strength, and hope. I grovelled into the pillow\r\nand tried to persuade myself that such hallucination was possible.\r\nImperceptibly, steadily, the dawn grew clearer.\r\n\r\nAt last, despairing of further sleep, I sat up in bed and looked\r\nabout me. A chill twilight rendered the whole chamber visible. It\r\nwas spacious and well-furnished, better furnished than any room I\r\nhad ever slept in before. A candle and matches became dimly visible\r\nupon a little pedestal in a recess. I threw back the bedclothes,\r\nand, shivering with the rawness of the early morning, albeit it was\r\nsummer-time, I got out and lit the candle. Then, trembling horribly,\r\nso that the extinguisher rattled on its spike, I tottered to the glass\r\nand saw--_Elvesham's face!_ It was none the less horrible because I\r\nhad already dimly feared as much. He had already seemed physically\r\nweak and pitiful to me, but seen now, dressed only in a coarse flannel\r\nnightdress that fell apart and showed the stringy neck, seen now as\r\nmy own body, I cannot describe its desolate decrepitude. The hollow\r\ncheeks, the straggling tail of dirty grey hair, the rheumy bleared\r\neyes, the quivering, shrivelled lips, the lower displaying a gleam of\r\nthe pink interior lining, and those horrible dark gums showing. You\r\nwho are mind and body together, at your natural years, cannot imagine\r\nwhat this fiendish imprisonment meant to me. To be young and full of\r\nthe desire and energy of youth, and to be caught, and presently to be\r\ncrushed in this tottering ruin of a body....\r\n\r\nBut I wander from the course of my story. For some time I must have\r\nbeen stunned at this change that had come upon me. It was daylight when\r\nI did so far gather myself together as to think. In some inexplicable\r\nway I had been changed, though how, short of magic, the thing had been\r\ndone, I could not say. And as I thought, the diabolical ingenuity of\r\nElvesham came home to me. It seemed plain to me that as I found myself\r\nin his, so he must be in possession of _my_ body, of my strength, that\r\nis, and my future. But how to prove it? Then, as I thought, the thing\r\nbecame so incredible, even to me, that my mind reeled, and I had to\r\npinch myself, to feel my toothless gums, to see myself in the glass,\r\nand touch the things about me, before I could steady myself to face the\r\nfacts again. Was all life hallucination? Was I indeed Elvesham, and he\r\nme? Had I been dreaming of Eden overnight? Was there any Eden? But if\r\nI was Elvesham, I should remember where I was on the previous morning,\r\nthe name of the town in which I lived, what happened before the dream\r\nbegan. I struggled with my thoughts. I recalled the queer doubleness of\r\nmy memories overnight. But now my mind was clear. Not the ghost of any\r\nmemories but those proper to Eden could I raise.\r\n\r\n\"This way lies insanity!\" I cried in my piping voice. I staggered to my\r\nfeet, dragged my feeble, heavy limbs to the washhand-stand, and plunged\r\nmy grey head into a basin of cold water. Then, towelling myself, I\r\ntried again. It was no good. I felt beyond all question that I was\r\nindeed Eden, not Elvesham. But Eden in Elvesham's body!\r\n\r\nHad I been a man of any other age, I might have given myself up to my\r\nfate as one enchanted. But in these sceptical days miracles do not pass\r\ncurrent. Here was some trick of psychology. What a drug and a steady\r\nstare could do, a drug and a steady stare, or some similar treatment,\r\ncould surely undo. Men have lost their memories before. But to exchange\r\nmemories as one does umbrellas! I laughed. Alas! not a healthy laugh,\r\nbut a wheezing, senile titter. I could have fancied old Elvesham\r\nlaughing at my plight, and a gust of petulant anger, unusual to me,\r\nswept across my feelings. I began dressing eagerly in the clothes I\r\nfound lying about on the floor, and only realised when I was dressed\r\nthat it was an evening suit I had assumed. I opened the wardrobe\r\nand found some more ordinary clothes, a pair of plaid trousers, and\r\nan old-fashioned dressing-gown. I put a venerable smoking-cap on my\r\nvenerable head, and, coughing a little from my exertions, tottered out\r\nupon the landing.\r\n\r\nIt was then, perhaps, a quarter to six, and the blinds were closely\r\ndrawn and the house quite silent. The landing was a spacious one, a\r\nbroad, richly-carpeted staircase went down into the darkness of the\r\nhall below, and before me a door ajar showed me a writing-desk, a\r\nrevolving bookcase, the back of a study chair, and a fine array of\r\nbound books, shelf upon shelf.\r\n\r\n\"My study,\" I mumbled, and walked across the landing. Then at the sound\r\nof my voice a thought struck me, and I went back to the bedroom and put\r\nin the set of false teeth. They slipped in with the ease of old habit.\r\n\"That's better,\" said I, gnashing them, and so returned to the study.\r\n\r\nThe drawers of the writing-desk were locked. Its revolving top was also\r\nlocked. I could see no indications of the keys, and there were none in\r\nthe pockets of my trousers. I shuffled back at once to the bedroom,\r\nand went through the dress suit, and afterwards the pockets of all the\r\ngarments I could find. I was very eager, and one might have imagined\r\nthat burglars had been at work, to see my room when I had done. Not\r\nonly were there no keys to be found, but not a coin, nor a scrap of\r\npaper--save only the receipted bill of the overnight dinner.\r\n\r\nA curious weariness asserted itself. I sat down and stared at the\r\ngarments flung here and there, their pockets turned inside out. My\r\nfirst frenzy had already flickered out. Every moment I was beginning\r\nto realise the immense intelligence of the plans of my enemy, to see\r\nmore and more clearly the hopelessness of my position. With an effort I\r\nrose and hurried hobbling into the study again. On the staircase was a\r\nhousemaid pulling up the blinds. She stared, I think, at the expression\r\nof my face. I shut the door of the study behind me, and, seizing a\r\npoker, began an attack upon the desk. That is how they found me. The\r\ncover of the desk was split, the lock smashed, the letters torn out of\r\nthe pigeon-holes and tossed about the room. In my senile rage I had\r\nflung about the pens and other such light stationery, and overturned\r\nthe ink. Moreover, a large vase upon the mantel had got broken--I do\r\nnot know how. I could find no cheque-book, no money, no indications of\r\nthe slightest use for the recovery of my body. I was battering madly at\r\nthe drawers, when the butler, backed by two women-servants, intruded\r\nupon me.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat simply is the story of my change. No one will believe my frantic\r\nassertions. I am treated as one demented, and even at this moment I\r\nam under restraint. But I am sane, absolutely sane, and to prove it I\r\nhave sat down to write this story minutely as the things happened to\r\nme. I appeal to the reader, whether there is any trace of insanity in\r\nthe style or method of the story he has been reading. I am a young man\r\nlocked away in an old man's body. But the clear fact is incredible to\r\neveryone. Naturally I appear demented to those who will not believe\r\nthis, naturally I do not know the names of my secretaries, of the\r\ndoctors who come to see me, of my servants and neighbours, of this\r\ntown (wherever it is) where I find myself. Naturally I lose myself in\r\nmy own house, and suffer inconveniences of every sort. Naturally I ask\r\nthe oddest questions. Naturally I weep and cry out, and have paroxysms\r\nof despair. I have no money and no cheque-book. The bank will not\r\nrecognise my signature, for I suppose that, allowing for the feeble\r\nmuscles I now have, my handwriting is still Eden's. These people about\r\nme will not let me go to the bank personally. It seems, indeed, that\r\nthere is no bank in this town, and that I have an account in some part\r\nof London. It seems that Elvesham kept the name of his solicitor secret\r\nfrom all his household--I can ascertain nothing. Elvesham was, of\r\ncourse, a profound student of mental science, and all my declarations\r\nof the facts of the case merely confirm the theory that my insanity\r\nis the outcome of overmuch brooding upon psychology. Dreams of the\r\npersonal identity indeed! Two days ago I was a healthy youngster,\r\nwith all life before me; now I am a furious old man, unkempt, and\r\ndesperate, and miserable, prowling about a great luxurious strange\r\nhouse, watched, feared, and avoided as a lunatic by everyone about me.\r\nAnd in London is Elvesham beginning life again in a vigorous body, and\r\nwith all the accumulated knowledge and wisdom of threescore and ten. He\r\nhas stolen my life.\r\n\r\nWhat has happened I do not clearly know. In the study are volumes\r\nof manuscript notes referring chiefly to the psychology of memory,\r\nand parts of what may be either calculations or ciphers in symbols\r\nabsolutely strange to me. In some passages there are indications that\r\nhe was also occupied with the philosophy of mathematics. I take it he\r\nhas transferred the whole of his memories, the accumulation that makes\r\nup his personality, from this old withered brain of his to mine, and,\r\nsimilarly, that he has transferred mine to his discarded tenement.\r\nPractically, that is, he has changed bodies. But how such a change\r\nmay be possible is without the range of my philosophy. I have been a\r\nmaterialist for all my thinking life, but here, suddenly, is a clear\r\ncase of man's detachability from matter.\r\n\r\nOne desperate experiment I am about to try. I sit writing here\r\nbefore putting the matter to issue. This morning, with the help of a\r\ntable-knife that I had secreted at breakfast, I succeeded in breaking\r\nopen a fairly obvious secret drawer in this wrecked writing-desk. I\r\ndiscovered nothing save a little green glass phial containing a white\r\npowder. Round the neck of the phial was a label, and thereon was\r\nwritten this one word, \"_Release_.\" This may be--is most probably,\r\npoison. I can understand Elvesham placing poison in my way, and I\r\nshould be sure that it was his intention so to get rid of the only\r\nliving witness against him, were it not for this careful concealment.\r\nThe man has practically solved the problem of immortality. Save for the\r\nspite of chance, he will live in my body until it has aged, and then,\r\nagain, throwing that aside, he will assume some other victim's youth\r\nand strength. When one remembers his heartlessness, it is terrible to\r\nthink of the ever-growing experience, that.... How long has he been\r\nleaping from body to body?... But I tire of writing. The powder appears\r\nto be soluble in water. The taste is not unpleasant.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere the narrative found upon Mr. Elvesham's desk ends. His dead body\r\nlay between the desk and the chair. The latter had been pushed back,\r\nprobably by his last convulsions. The story was written in pencil,\r\nand in a crazy hand, quite unlike his usual minute characters. There\r\nremain only two curious facts to record. Indisputably there was some\r\nconnection between Eden and Elvesham, since the whole of Elvesham's\r\nproperty was bequeathed to the young man. But he never inherited. When\r\nElvesham committed suicide, Eden was, strangely enough, already dead.\r\nTwenty-four hours before, he had been knocked down by a cab and killed\r\ninstantly, at the crowded crossing at the intersection of Gower Street\r\nand Euston Road. So that the only human being who could have thrown\r\nlight upon this fantastic narrative is beyond the reach of questions.\r\nWithout further comment I leave this extraordinary matter to the\r\nreader's individual judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE ABYSS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant stood in front of the steel sphere and gnawed a piece of\r\npine splinter. \"What do you think of it, Steevens?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"It's an idea,\" said Steevens, in the tone of one who keeps an open\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n\"I believe it will smash--flat,\" said the lieutenant.\r\n\r\n\"He seems to have calculated it all out pretty well,\" said Steevens,\r\nstill impartial.\r\n\r\n\"But think of the pressure,\" said the lieutenant. \"At the surface\r\nof the water it's fourteen pounds to the inch, thirty feet down\r\nit's double that; sixty, treble; ninety, four times; nine hundred,\r\nforty times; five thousand, three hundred--that's a mile--it's two\r\nhundred and forty times fourteen pounds; that's--let's see--thirty\r\nhundredweight--a ton and a half, Steevens; _a ton and a half_ to the\r\nsquare inch. And the ocean where he's going is five miles deep. That's\r\nseven and a half\"--\r\n\r\n\"Sounds a lot,\" said Steevens, \"but it's jolly thick steel.\"\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant made no answer, but resumed his pine splinter. The\r\nobject of their conversation was a huge ball of steel, having an\r\nexterior diameter of perhaps nine feet. It looked like the shot\r\nfor some Titanic piece of artillery. It was elaborately nested in a\r\nmonstrous scaffolding built into the framework of the vessel, and\r\nthe gigantic spars that were presently to sling it overboard gave\r\nthe stern of the ship an appearance that had raised the curiosity\r\nof every decent sailor who had sighted it, from the Pool of London\r\nto the Tropic of Capricorn. In two places, one above the other, the\r\nsteel gave place to a couple of circular windows of enormously thick\r\nglass, and one of these, set in a steel frame of great solidity, was\r\nnow partially unscrewed. Both the men had seen the interior of this\r\nglobe for the first time that morning. It was elaborately padded with\r\nair cushions, with little studs sunk between bulging pillows to work\r\nthe simple mechanism of the affair. Everything was elaborately padded,\r\neven the Myers apparatus which was to absorb carbonic acid and replace\r\nthe oxygen inspired by its tenant, when he had crept in by the glass\r\nmanhole, and had been screwed in. It was so elaborately padded that a\r\nman might have been fired from a gun in it with perfect safety. And it\r\nhad need to be, for presently a man was to crawl in through that glass\r\nmanhole, to be screwed up tightly, and to be flung overboard, and to\r\nsink down--down--down, for five miles, even as the lieutenant said. It\r\nhad taken the strongest hold of his imagination; it made him a bore at\r\nmess; and he found Steevens, the new arrival aboard, a godsend to talk\r\nto about it, over and over again.\r\n\r\n\"It's my opinion,\" said the lieutenant, \"that that glass will simply\r\nbend in and bulge and smash, under a pressure of that sort. Daubrée\r\nhas made rocks run like water under big pressures--and, you mark my\r\nwords\"--\r\n\r\n\"If the glass did break in,\" said Steevens, \"what then?\"\r\n\r\n\"The water would shoot in like a jet of iron. Have you ever felt a\r\nstraight jet of high pressure water? It would hit as hard as a bullet.\r\nIt would simply smash him and flatten him. It would tear down his\r\nthroat, and into his lungs; it would blow in his ears\"--\r\n\r\n\"What a detailed imagination you have!\" protested Steevens, who saw\r\nthings vividly.\r\n\r\n\"It's a simple statement of the inevitable,\" said the lieutenant.\r\n\r\n\"And the globe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Would just give out a few little bubbles, and it would settle down\r\ncomfortably against the day of judgment, among the oozes and the bottom\r\nclay--with poor Elstead spread over his own smashed cushions like\r\nbutter over bread.\"\r\n\r\nHe repeated this sentence as though he liked it very much. \"Like butter\r\nover bread,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Having a look at the jigger?\" said a voice, and Elstead stood behind\r\nthem, spick and span in white, with a cigarette between his teeth,\r\nand his eyes smiling out of the shadow of his ample hat-brim. \"What's\r\nthat about bread and butter, Weybridge? Grumbling as usual about the\r\ninsufficient pay of naval officers? It won't be more than a day now\r\nbefore I start. We are to get the slings ready to-day. This clean sky\r\nand gentle swell is just the kind of thing for swinging off a dozen\r\ntons of lead and iron; isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It won't affect you much,\" said Weybridge.\r\n\r\n\"No. Seventy or eighty feet down, and I shall be there in a dozen\r\nseconds, there's not a particle moving, though the wind shriek itself\r\nhoarse up above, and the water lifts halfway to the clouds. No. Down\r\nthere\"-- He moved to the side of the ship and the other two followed\r\nhim. All three leant forward on their elbows and stared down into the\r\nyellow-green water.\r\n\r\n\"_Peace_,\" said Elstead, finishing his thought aloud.\r\n\r\n\"Are you dead certain that clockwork will act?\" asked Weybridge\r\npresently.\r\n\r\n\"It has worked thirty-five times,\" said Elstead. \"It's bound to work.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if it doesn't?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why shouldn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't go down in that confounded thing,\" said Weybridge, \"for\r\ntwenty thousand pounds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cheerful chap you are,\" said Elstead, and spat sociably at a bubble\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\n\"I don't understand yet how you mean to work the thing,\" said Steevens.\r\n\r\n\"In the first place, I'm screwed into the sphere,\" said Elstead, \"and\r\nwhen I've turned the electric light off and on three times to show I'm\r\ncheerful, I'm swung out over the stern by that crane, with all those\r\nbig lead sinkers slung below me. The top lead weight has a roller\r\ncarrying a hundred fathoms of strong cord rolled up, and that's all\r\nthat joins the sinkers to the sphere, except the slings that will be\r\ncut when the affair is dropped. We use cord rather than wire rope\r\nbecause it's easier to cut and more buoyant--necessary points, as you\r\nwill see.\r\n\r\n\"Through each of these lead weights you notice there is a hole, and\r\nan iron rod will be run through that and will project six feet on the\r\nlower side. If that rod is rammed up from below, it knocks up a lever\r\nand sets the clockwork in motion at the side of the cylinder on which\r\nthe cord winds.\r\n\r\n\"Very well. The whole affair is lowered gently into the water, and the\r\nslings are cut. The sphere floats,--with the air in it, it's lighter\r\nthan water,--but the lead weights go down straight and the cord runs\r\nout. When the cord is all paid out, the sphere will go down too, pulled\r\ndown by the cord.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why the cord?\" asked Steevens. \"Why not fasten the weights\r\ndirectly to the sphere?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because of the smash down below. The whole affair will go rushing\r\ndown, mile after mile, at a headlong pace at last. It would be knocked\r\nto pieces on the bottom if it wasn't for that cord. But the weights\r\nwill hit the bottom, and directly they do, the buoyancy of the sphere\r\nwill come into play. It will go on sinking slower and slower; come to a\r\nstop at last, and then begin to float upward again.\r\n\r\n\"That's where the clockwork comes in. Directly the weights smash\r\nagainst the sea bottom, the rod will be knocked through and will kick\r\nup the clockwork, and the cord will be rewound on the reel. I shall be\r\nlugged down to the sea bottom. There I shall stay for half an hour,\r\nwith the electric light on, looking about me. Then the clockwork\r\nwill release a spring knife, the cord will be cut, and up I shall\r\nrush again, like a soda-water bubble. The cord itself will help the\r\nflotation.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if you should chance to hit a ship?\" said Weybridge.\r\n\r\n\"I should come up at such a pace, I should go clean through it,\" said\r\nElstead, \"like a cannon ball. You needn't worry about that.\"\r\n\r\n\"And suppose some nimble crustacean should wriggle into your\r\nclockwork\"--\r\n\r\n\"It would be a pressing sort of invitation for me to stop,\" said\r\nElstead, turning his back on the water and staring at the sphere.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey had swung Elstead overboard by eleven o'clock. The day was\r\nserenely bright and calm, with the horizon lost in haze. The electric\r\nglare in the little upper compartment beamed cheerfully three times.\r\nThen they let him down slowly to the surface of the water, and a sailor\r\nin the stern chains hung ready to cut the tackle that held the lead\r\nweights and the sphere together. The globe, which had looked so large\r\non deck, looked the smallest thing conceivable under the stern of the\r\nship. It rolled a little, and its two dark windows, which floated\r\nuppermost, seemed like eyes turned up in round wonderment at the people\r\nwho crowded the rail. A voice wondered how Elstead liked the rolling.\r\n\"Are you ready?\" sang out the commander. \"Ay, ay, sir!\" \"Then let her\r\ngo!\"\r\n\r\nThe rope of the tackle tightened against the blade and was cut, and an\r\neddy rolled over the globe in a grotesquely helpless fashion. Someone\r\nwaved a handkerchief, someone else tried an ineffectual cheer, a middy\r\nwas counting slowly, \"Eight, nine, ten!\" Another roll, then with a jerk\r\nand a splash the thing righted itself.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to be stationary for a moment, to grow rapidly smaller, and\r\nthen the water closed over it, and it became visible, enlarged by\r\nrefraction and dimmer, below the surface. Before one could count three\r\nit had disappeared. There was a flicker of white light far down in the\r\nwater, that diminished to a speck and vanished. Then there was nothing\r\nbut a depth of water going down into blackness, through which a shark\r\nwas swimming.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly the screw of the cruiser began to rotate, the water was\r\ncrickled, the shark disappeared in a wrinkled confusion, and a torrent\r\nof foam rushed across the crystalline clearness that had swallowed up\r\nElstead. \"What's the idee?\" said one A.B. to another.\r\n\r\n\"We're going to lay off about a couple of miles, 'fear he should hit us\r\nwhen he comes up,\" said his mate.\r\n\r\nThe ship steamed slowly to her new position. Aboard her almost everyone\r\nwho was unoccupied remained watching the breathing swell into which\r\nthe sphere had sunk. For the next half-hour it is doubtful if a word\r\nwas spoken that did not bear directly or indirectly on Elstead. The\r\nDecember sun was now high in the sky, and the heat very considerable.\r\n\r\n\"He'll be cold enough down there,\" said Weybridge. \"They say that below\r\na certain depth sea water's always just about freezing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where'll he come up?\" asked Steevens. \"I've lost my bearings.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the spot,\" said the commander, who prided himself on his\r\nomniscience. He extended a precise finger south-eastward. \"And this, I\r\nreckon, is pretty nearly the moment,\" he said. \"He's been thirty-five\r\nminutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long does it take to reach the bottom of the ocean?\" asked\r\nSteevens.\r\n\r\n\"For a depth of five miles, and reckoning--as we did--an acceleration\r\nof two feet per second, both ways, is just about three-quarters of a\r\nminute.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then he's overdue,\" said Weybridge.\r\n\r\n\"Pretty nearly,\" said the commander. \"I suppose it takes a few minutes\r\nfor that cord of his to wind in.\"\r\n\r\n\"I forgot that,\" said Weybridge, evidently relieved.\r\n\r\nAnd then began the suspense. A minute slowly dragged itself out, and no\r\nsphere shot out of the water. Another followed, and nothing broke the\r\nlow oily swell. The sailors explained to one another that little point\r\nabout the winding-in of the cord. The rigging was dotted with expectant\r\nfaces. \"Come up, Elstead!\" called one hairy-chested salt impatiently,\r\nand the others caught it up, and shouted as though they were waiting\r\nfor the curtain of a theatre to rise.\r\n\r\nThe commander glanced irritably at them.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, if the acceleration's less than two,\" he said, \"he'll\r\nbe all the longer. We aren't absolutely certain that was the proper\r\nfigure. I'm no slavish believer in calculations.\"\r\n\r\nSteevens agreed concisely. No one on the quarter-deck spoke for a\r\ncouple of minutes. Then Steevens' watchcase clicked.\r\n\r\nWhen, twenty-one minutes after, the sun reached the zenith, they were\r\nstill waiting for the globe to reappear, and not a man aboard had\r\ndared to whisper that hope was dead. It was Weybridge who first gave\r\nexpression to that realisation. He spoke while the sound of eight bells\r\nstill hung in the air. \"I always distrusted that window,\" he said quite\r\nsuddenly to Steevens.\r\n\r\n\"Good God!\" said Steevens; \"you don't think--?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" said Weybridge, and left the rest to his imagination.\r\n\r\n\"I'm no great believer in calculations myself,\" said the commander\r\ndubiously, \"so that I'm not altogether hopeless yet.\" And at midnight\r\nthe gunboat was steaming slowly in a spiral round the spot where\r\nthe globe had sunk, and the white beam of the electric light fled\r\nand halted and swept discontentedly onward again over the waste of\r\nphosphorescent waters under the little stars.\r\n\r\n\"If his window hasn't burst and smashed him,\" said Weybridge, \"then\r\nit's a cursed sight worse, for his clockwork has gone wrong, and he's\r\nalive now, five miles under our feet, down there in the cold and dark,\r\nanchored in that little bubble of his, where never a ray of light has\r\nshone or a human being lived, since the waters were gathered together.\r\nHe's there without food, feeling hungry and thirsty and scared,\r\nwondering whether he'll starve or stifle. Which will it be? The Myers\r\napparatus is running out, I suppose. How long do they last?\"\r\n\r\n\"Good heavens!\" he exclaimed; \"what little things we are! What daring\r\nlittle devils! Down there, miles and miles of water--all water, and\r\nall this empty water about us and this sky. Gulfs!\" He threw his hands\r\nout, and as he did so, a little white streak swept noiselessly up the\r\nsky, travelled more slowly, stopped, became a motionless dot, as though\r\na new star had fallen up into the sky. Then it went sliding back again\r\nand lost itself amidst the reflections of the stars and the white haze\r\nof the sea's phosphorescence.\r\n\r\nAt the sight he stopped, arm extended and mouth open. He shut his\r\nmouth, opened it again, and waved his arms with an impatient gesture.\r\nThen he turned, shouted \"El-stead ahoy!\" to the first watch, and\r\nwent at a run to Lindley and the search-light. \"I saw him,\" he said.\r\n\"Starboard there! His light's on, and he's just shot out of the water.\r\nBring the light round. We ought to see him drifting, when he lifts on\r\nthe swell.\"\r\n\r\nBut they never picked up the explorer until dawn. Then they almost ran\r\nhim down. The crane was swung out and a boat's crew hooked the chain\r\nto the sphere. When they had shipped the sphere, they unscrewed the\r\nmanhole and peered into the darkness of the interior (for the electric\r\nlight chamber was intended to illuminate the water about the sphere,\r\nand was shut off entirely from its general cavity).\r\n\r\nThe air was very hot within the cavity, and the indiarubber at the lip\r\nof the manhole was soft. There was no answer to their eager questions\r\nand no sound of movement within. Elstead seemed to be lying motionless,\r\ncrumpled up in the bottom of the globe. The ship's doctor crawled in\r\nand lifted him out to the men outside. For a moment or so they did not\r\nknow whether Elstead was alive or dead. His face, in the yellow light\r\nof the ship's lamps, glistened with perspiration. They carried him down\r\nto his own cabin.\r\n\r\nHe was not dead, they found, but in a state of absolute nervous\r\ncollapse, and besides cruelly bruised. For some days he had to lie\r\nperfectly still. It was a week before he could tell his experiences.\r\n\r\nAlmost his first words were that he was going down again. The sphere\r\nwould have to be altered, he said, in order to allow him to throw off\r\nthe cord if need be, and that was all. He had had the most marvellous\r\nexperience. \"You thought I should find nothing but ooze,\" he said. \"You\r\nlaughed at my explorations, and I've discovered a new world!\" He told\r\nhis story in disconnected fragments, and chiefly from the wrong end, so\r\nthat it is impossible to re-tell it in his words. But what follows is\r\nthe narrative of his experience.\r\n\r\nIt began atrociously, he said. Before the cord ran out, the thing kept\r\nrolling over. He felt like a frog in a football. He could see nothing\r\nbut the crane and the sky overhead, with an occasional glimpse of the\r\npeople on the ship's rail. He couldn't tell a bit which way the thing\r\nwould roll next. Suddenly he would find his feet going up, and try to\r\nstep, and over he went rolling, head over heels, and just anyhow, on\r\nthe padding. Any other shape would have been more comfortable, but\r\nno other shape was to be relied upon under the huge pressure of the\r\nnethermost abyss.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the swaying ceased; the globe righted, and when he had\r\npicked himself up, he saw the water all about him greeny-blue, with\r\nan attenuated light filtering down from above, and a shoal of little\r\nfloating things went rushing up past him, as it seemed to him, towards\r\nthe light. And even as he looked, it grew darker and darker, until\r\nthe water above was as dark as the midnight sky, albeit of a greener\r\nshade, and the water below black. And little transparent things in the\r\nwater developed a faint glint of luminosity, and shot past him in faint\r\ngreenish streaks.\r\n\r\nAnd the feeling of falling! It was just like the start of a lift, he\r\nsaid, only it kept on. One has to imagine what that means, that keeping\r\non. It was then of all times that Elstead repented of his adventure. He\r\nsaw the chances against him in an altogether new light. He thought of\r\nthe big cuttlefish people knew to exist in the middle waters, the kind\r\nof things they find half digested in whales at times, or floating dead\r\nand rotten and half eaten by fish. Suppose one caught hold and wouldn't\r\nlet go. And had the clockwork really been sufficiently tested? But\r\nwhether he wanted to go on or to go back mattered not the slightest now.\r\n\r\nIn fifty seconds everything was as black as night outside, except where\r\nthe beam from his light struck through the waters, and picked out every\r\nnow and then some fish or scrap of sinking matter. They flashed by too\r\nfast for him to see what they were. Once he thinks he passed a shark.\r\nAnd then the sphere began to get hot by friction against the water.\r\nThey had underestimated this, it seems.\r\n\r\nThe first thing he noticed was that he was perspiring, and then he\r\nheard a hissing growing louder under his feet, and saw a lot of little\r\nbubbles--very little bubbles they were--rushing upward like a fan\r\nthrough the water outside. Steam! He felt the window, and it was hot.\r\nHe turned on the minute glow-lamp that lit his own cavity, looked at\r\nthe padded watch by the studs, and saw he had been travelling now for\r\ntwo minutes. It came into his head that the window would crack through\r\nthe conflict of temperatures, for he knew the bottom water is very near\r\nfreezing.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly the floor of the sphere seemed to press against his feet,\r\nthe rush of bubbles outside grew slower and slower, and the hissing\r\ndiminished. The sphere rolled a little. The window had not cracked,\r\nnothing had given, and he knew that the dangers of sinking, at anyrate,\r\nwere over.\r\n\r\nIn another minute or so he would be on the floor of the abyss. He\r\nthought, he said, of Steevens and Weybridge and the rest of them five\r\nmiles overhead, higher to him than the very highest clouds that ever\r\nfloated over land are to us, steaming slowly and staring down and\r\nwondering what had happened to him.\r\n\r\nHe peered out of the window. There were no more bubbles now, and the\r\nhissing had stopped. Outside there was a heavy blackness--as black as\r\nblack velvet--except where the electric light pierced the empty water\r\nand showed the colour of it--a yellow-green. Then three things like\r\nshapes of fire swam into sight, following each other through the water.\r\nWhether they were little and near or big and far off he could not tell.\r\n\r\nEach was outlined in a bluish light almost as bright as the lights of\r\na fishing smack, a light which seemed to be smoking greatly, and all\r\nalong the sides of them were specks of this, like the lighter portholes\r\nof a ship. Their phosphorescence seemed to go out as they came into\r\nthe radiance of his lamp, and he saw then that they were little fish\r\nof some strange sort, with huge heads, vast eyes, and dwindling bodies\r\nand tails. Their eyes were turned towards him, and he judged they were\r\nfollowing him down. He supposed they were attracted by his glare.\r\n\r\nPresently others of the same sort joined them. As he went on down,\r\nhe noticed that the water became of a pallid colour, and that little\r\nspecks twinkled in his ray like motes in a sunbeam. This was probably\r\ndue to the clouds of ooze and mud that the impact of his leaden sinkers\r\nhad disturbed.\r\n\r\nBy the time he was drawn down to the lead weights he was in a dense fog\r\nof white that his electric light failed altogether to pierce for more\r\nthan a few yards, and many minutes elapsed before the hanging sheets\r\nof sediment subsided to any extent. Then, lit by his light and by the\r\ntransient phosphorescence of a distant shoal of fishes, he was able to\r\nsee under the huge blackness of the super-incumbent water an undulating\r\nexpanse of greyish-white ooze, broken here and there by tangled\r\nthickets of a growth of sea lilies, waving hungry tentacles in the air.\r\n\r\nFarther away were the graceful, translucent outlines of a group of\r\ngigantic sponges. About this floor there were scattered a number of\r\nbristling flattish tufts of rich purple and black, which he decided\r\nmust be some sort of sea-urchin, and small, large-eyed or blind things\r\nhaving a curious resemblance, some to woodlice, and others to lobsters,\r\ncrawled sluggishly across the track of the light and vanished into the\r\nobscurity again, leaving furrowed trails behind them.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly the hovering swarm of little fishes veered about and came\r\ntowards him as a flight of starlings might do. They passed over him\r\nlike a phosphorescent snow, and then he saw behind them some larger\r\ncreature advancing towards the sphere.\r\n\r\nAt first he could see it only dimly, a faintly moving figure remotely\r\nsuggestive of a walking man, and then it came into the spray of light\r\nthat the lamp shot out. As the glare struck it, it shut its eyes,\r\ndazzled. He stared in rigid astonishment.\r\n\r\nIt was a strange vertebrated animal. Its dark purple head was dimly\r\nsuggestive of a chameleon, but it had such a high forehead and such a\r\nbraincase as no reptile ever displayed before; the vertical pitch of\r\nits face gave it a most extraordinary resemblance to a human being.\r\n\r\nTwo large and protruding eyes projected from sockets in chameleon\r\nfashion, and it had a broad reptilian mouth with horny lips beneath its\r\nlittle nostrils. In the position of the ears were two huge gill-covers,\r\nand out of these floated a branching tree of coralline filaments,\r\nalmost like the tree-like gills that very young rays and sharks possess.\r\n\r\nBut the humanity of the face was not the most extraordinary thing about\r\nthe creature. It was a biped; its almost globular body was poised on a\r\ntripod of two frog-like legs and a long thick tail, and its fore limbs,\r\nwhich grotesquely caricatured the human hand, much as a frog's do,\r\ncarried a long shaft of bone, tipped with copper. The colour of the\r\ncreature was variegated; its head, hands, and legs were purple; but\r\nits skin, which hung loosely upon it, even as clothes might do, was a\r\nphosphorescent grey. And it stood there blinded by the light.\r\n\r\nAt last this unknown creature of the abyss blinked its eyes open,\r\nand, shading them with its disengaged hand, opened its mouth and gave\r\nvent to a shouting noise, articulate almost as speech might be, that\r\npenetrated even the steel case and padded jacket of the sphere. How a\r\nshouting may be accomplished without lungs Elstead does not profess to\r\nexplain. It then moved sideways out of the glare into the mystery of\r\nshadow that bordered it on either side, and Elstead felt rather than\r\nsaw that it was coming towards him. Fancying the light had attracted\r\nit, he turned the switch that cut off the current. In another moment\r\nsomething soft dabbed upon the steel, and the globe swayed.\r\n\r\nThen the shouting was repeated, and it seemed to him that a distant\r\necho answered it. The dabbing recurred, and the globe swayed and ground\r\nagainst the spindle over which the wire was rolled. He stood in the\r\nblackness and peered out into the everlasting night of the abyss.\r\nAnd presently he saw, very faint and remote, other phosphorescent\r\nquasi-human forms hurrying towards him.\r\n\r\nHardly knowing what he did, he felt about in his swaying prison for\r\nthe stud of the exterior electric light, and came by accident against\r\nhis own small glow-lamp in its padded recess. The sphere twisted, and\r\nthen threw him down; he heard shouts like shouts of surprise, and when\r\nhe rose to his feet, he saw two pairs of stalked eyes peering into the\r\nlower window and reflecting his light.\r\n\r\nIn another moment hands were dabbing vigorously at his steel casing,\r\nand there was a sound, horrible enough in his position, of the metal\r\nprotection of the clockwork being vigorously hammered. That, indeed,\r\nsent his heart into his mouth, for if these strange creatures succeeded\r\nin stopping that, his release would never occur. Scarcely had he\r\nthought as much when he felt the sphere sway violently, and the floor\r\nof it press hard against his feet. He turned off the small glow-lamp\r\nthat lit the interior, and sent the ray of the large light in the\r\nseparate compartment out into the water. The sea-floor and the man-like\r\ncreatures had disappeared, and a couple of fish chasing each other\r\ndropped suddenly by the window.\r\n\r\nHe thought at once that these strange denizens of the deep sea had\r\nbroken the rope, and that he had escaped. He drove up faster and\r\nfaster, and then stopped with a jerk that sent him flying against the\r\npadded roof of his prison. For half a minute, perhaps, he was too\r\nastonished to think.\r\n\r\nThen he felt that the sphere was spinning slowly, and rocking, and\r\nit seemed to him that it was also being drawn through the water. By\r\ncrouching close to the window, he managed to make his weight effective\r\nand roll that part of the sphere downward, but he could see nothing\r\nsave the pale ray of his light striking down ineffectively into the\r\ndarkness. It occurred to him that he would see more if he turned the\r\nlamp off, and allowed his eyes to grow accustomed to the profound\r\nobscurity.\r\n\r\nIn this he was wise. After some minutes the velvety blackness became a\r\ntranslucent blackness, and then, far away, and as faint as the zodiacal\r\nlight of an English summer evening, he saw shapes moving below. He\r\njudged these creatures had detached his cable, and were towing him\r\nalong the sea bottom.\r\n\r\nAnd then he saw something faint and remote across the undulations of\r\nthe submarine plain, a broad horizon of pale luminosity that extended\r\nthis way and that way as far as the range of his little window\r\npermitted him to see. To this he was being towed, as a balloon might be\r\ntowed by men out of the open country into a town. He approached it very\r\nslowly, and very slowly the dim irradiation was gathered together into\r\nmore definite shapes.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly five o'clock before he came over this luminous area, and\r\nby that time he could make out an arrangement suggestive of streets\r\nand houses grouped about a vast roofless erection that was grotesquely\r\nsuggestive of a ruined abbey. It was spread out like a map below him.\r\nThe houses were all roofless enclosures of walls, and their substance\r\nbeing, as he afterwards saw, of phosphorescent bones, gave the place an\r\nappearance as if it were built of drowned moonshine.\r\n\r\nAmong the inner caves of the place waving trees of crinoid stretched\r\ntheir tentacles, and tall, slender, glassy sponges shot like shining\r\nminarets and lilies of filmy light out of the general glow of the\r\ncity. In the open spaces of the place he could see a stirring movement\r\nas of crowds of people, but he was too many fathoms above them to\r\ndistinguish the individuals in those crowds.\r\n\r\nThen slowly they pulled him down, and as they did so, the details of\r\nthe place crept slowly upon his apprehension. He saw that the courses\r\nof the cloudy buildings were marked out with beaded lines of round\r\nobjects, and then he perceived that at several points below him, in\r\nbroad open spaces, were forms like the encrusted shapes of ships.\r\n\r\nSlowly and surely he was drawn down, and the forms below him became\r\nbrighter, clearer, more distinct. He was being pulled down, he\r\nperceived, towards the large building in the centre of the town, and he\r\ncould catch a glimpse ever and again of the multitudinous forms that\r\nwere lugging at his cord. He was astonished to see that the rigging of\r\none of the ships, which formed such a prominent feature of the place,\r\nwas crowded with a host of gesticulating figures regarding him, and\r\nthen the walls of the great building rose about him silently, and hid\r\nthe city from his eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd such walls they were, of water-logged wood, and twisted wire-rope,\r\nand iron spars, and copper, and the bones and skulls of dead men. The\r\nskulls ran in zigzag lines and spirals and fantastic curves over the\r\nbuilding; and in and out of their eye-sockets, and over the whole\r\nsurface of the place, lurked and played a multitude of silvery little\r\nfishes.\r\n\r\nSuddenly his ears were filled with a low shouting and a noise like the\r\nviolent blowing of horns, and this gave place to a fantastic chant.\r\nDown the sphere sank, past the huge pointed windows, through which he\r\nsaw vaguely a great number of these strange, ghostlike people regarding\r\nhim, and at last he came to rest, as it seemed, on a kind of altar that\r\nstood in the centre of the place.\r\n\r\nAnd now he was at such a level that he could see these strange people\r\nof the abyss plainly once more. To his astonishment, he perceived that\r\nthey were prostrating themselves before him, all save one, dressed as\r\nit seemed in a robe of placoid scales, and crowned with a luminous\r\ndiadem, who stood with his reptilian mouth opening and shutting, as\r\nthough he led the chanting of the worshippers.\r\n\r\nA curious impulse made Elstead turn on his small glow-lamp again, so\r\nthat he became visible to these creatures of the abyss, albeit the\r\nglare made them disappear forthwith into night. At this sudden sight\r\nof him, the chanting gave place to a tumult of exultant shouts; and\r\nElstead, being anxious to watch them, turned his light off again, and\r\nvanished from before their eyes. But for a time he was too blind to\r\nmake out what they were doing, and when at last he could distinguish\r\nthem, they were kneeling again. And thus they continued worshipping\r\nhim, without rest or intermission, for the space of three hours.\r\n\r\nMost circumstantial was Elstead's account of this astounding city and\r\nits people, these people of perpetual night, who have never seen sun\r\nor moon or stars, green vegetation, nor any living, air-breathing\r\ncreatures, who know nothing of fire, nor any light but the\r\nphosphorescent light of living things.\r\n\r\nStartling as is his story, it is yet more startling to find that\r\nscientific men, of such eminence as Adams and Jenkins, find nothing\r\nincredible in it. They tell me they see no reason why intelligent,\r\nwater-breathing, vertebrated creatures, inured to a low temperature and\r\nenormous pressure, and of such a heavy structure, that neither alive\r\nnor dead would they float, might not live upon the bottom of the deep\r\nsea, and quite unsuspected by us, descendants like ourselves of the\r\ngreat Theriomorpha of the New Red Sandstone age.\r\n\r\nWe should be known to them, however, as strange, meteoric creatures,\r\nwont to fall catastrophically dead out of the mysterious blackness of\r\ntheir watery sky. And not only we ourselves, but our ships, our metals,\r\nour appliances, would come raining down out of the night. Sometimes\r\nsinking things would smite down and crush them, as if it were the\r\njudgment of some unseen power above, and sometimes would come things of\r\nthe utmost rarity or utility, or shapes of inspiring suggestion. One\r\ncan understand, perhaps, something of their behaviour at the descent of\r\na living man, if one thinks what a barbaric people might do, to whom an\r\nenhaloed, shining creature came suddenly out of the sky.\r\n\r\nAt one time or another Elstead probably told the officers of the\r\n_Ptarmigan_ every detail of his strange twelve hours in the abyss. That\r\nhe also intended to write them down is certain, but he never did, and\r\nso unhappily we have to piece together the discrepant fragments of his\r\nstory from the reminiscences of Commander Simmons, Weybridge, Steevens,\r\nLindley, and the others.\r\n\r\nWe see the thing darkly in fragmentary glimpses--the huge ghostly\r\nbuilding, the bowing, chanting people, with their dark chameleon-like\r\nheads and faintly luminous clothing, and Elstead, with his light turned\r\non again, vainly trying to convey to their minds that the cord by which\r\nthe sphere was held was to be severed. Minute after minute slipped\r\naway, and Elstead, looking at his watch, was horrified to find that he\r\nhad oxygen only for four hours more. But the chant in his honour kept\r\non as remorselessly as if it was the marching song of his approaching\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThe manner of his release he does not understand, but to judge by the\r\nend of cord that hung from the sphere, it had been cut through by\r\nrubbing against the edge of the altar. Abruptly the sphere rolled over,\r\nand he swept up, out of their world, as an ethereal creature clothed\r\nin a vacuum would sweep through our own atmosphere back to its native\r\nether again. He must have torn out of their sight as a hydrogen bubble\r\nhastens upward from our air. A strange ascension it must have seemed to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe sphere rushed up with even greater velocity than, when weighted\r\nwith the lead sinkers, it had rushed down. It became exceedingly hot.\r\nIt drove up with the windows uppermost, and he remembers the torrent of\r\nbubbles frothing against the glass. Every moment he expected this to\r\nfly. Then suddenly something like a huge wheel seemed to be released\r\nin his head, the padded compartment began spinning about him, and he\r\nfainted. His next recollection was of his cabin, and of the doctor's\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nBut that is the substance of the extraordinary story that Elstead\r\nrelated in fragments to the officers of the _Ptarmigan_. He promised to\r\nwrite it all down at a later date. His mind was chiefly occupied with\r\nthe improvement of his apparatus, which was effected at Rio.\r\n\r\nIt remains only to tell that on February 2, 1896, he made his second\r\ndescent into the ocean abyss, with the improvements his first\r\nexperience suggested. What happened we shall probably never know.\r\nHe never returned. The _Ptarmigan_ beat about over the point of his\r\nsubmersion, seeking him in vain for thirteen days. Then she returned to\r\nRio, and the news was telegraphed to his friends. So the matter remains\r\nfor the present. But it is hardly probable that no further attempt\r\nwill be made to verify his strange story of these hitherto unsuspected\r\ncities of the deep sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE APPLE\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I must get rid of it,\" said the man in the corner of the carriage,\r\nabruptly breaking the silence.\r\n\r\nMr. Hinchcliff looked up, hearing imperfectly. He had been lost in\r\nthe rapt contemplation of the college cap tied by a string to his\r\nportmanteau handles--the outward and visible sign of his newly-gained\r\npedagogic position--in the rapt appreciation of the college cap and\r\nthe pleasant anticipations it excited. For Mr. Hinchcliff had just\r\nmatriculated at London University, and was going to be junior assistant\r\nat the Holmwood Grammar School--a very enviable position. He stared\r\nacross the carriage at his fellow-traveller.\r\n\r\n\"Why not give it away?\" said this person. \"Give it away! Why not?\"\r\n\r\nHe was a tall, dark, sunburnt man with a pale face. His arms were\r\nfolded tightly, and his feet were on the seat in front of him. He was\r\npulling at a lank black moustache. He stared hard at his toes.\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" he said.\r\n\r\nMr. Hinchcliff coughed.\r\n\r\nThe stranger lifted his eyes--they were curious, dark-grey eyes--and\r\nstared blankly at Mr. Hinchcliff for the best part of a minute,\r\nperhaps. His expression grew to interest.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said slowly. \"Why not? And end it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't quite follow you, I'm afraid,\" said Mr. Hinchcliff, with\r\nanother cough.\r\n\r\n\"You don't quite follow me?\" said the stranger quite mechanically,\r\nhis singular eyes wandering from Mr. Hinchcliff to the bag with its\r\nostentatiously displayed cap, and back to Mr. Hinchcliff's downy face.\r\n\r\n\"You're so abrupt, you know,\" apologised Mr Hinchcliff.\r\n\r\n\"Why shouldn't I?\" said the stranger, following his thoughts. \"You are\r\na student?\" he said, addressing Mr. Hinchcliff.\r\n\r\n\"I am--by Correspondence--of the London University,\" said Mr.\r\nHinchcliff, with irrepressible pride, and feeling nervously at his tie.\r\n\r\n\"In pursuit of knowledge,\" said the stranger, and suddenly took his\r\nfeet off the seat, put his fist on his knees, and stared at Mr.\r\nHinchcliff as though he had never seen a student before. \"Yes,\" he\r\nsaid, and flung out an index finger. Then he rose, took a bag from\r\nthe hat-rack, and unlocked it. Quite silently he drew out something\r\nround and wrapped in a quantity of silver-paper, and unfolded this\r\ncarefully. He held it out towards Mr. Hinchcliff--a small, very smooth,\r\ngolden-yellow fruit.\r\n\r\nMr. Hinchcliff's eyes and mouth were open. He did not offer to take\r\nthis object--if he was intended to take it.\r\n\r\n\"That,\" said this fantastic stranger, speaking very slowly, \"is the\r\nApple of the Tree of Knowledge. Look at it--small, and bright, and\r\nwonderful--Knowledge--and I am going to give it to you.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hinchcliff's mind worked painfully for a minute, and then\r\nthe sufficient explanation, \"Mad!\" flashed across his brain, and\r\nilluminated the whole situation. One humoured madmen. He put his head a\r\nlittle on one side.\r\n\r\n\"The Apple of the Tree of Knowledge, eigh!\" said Mr. Hinchcliff,\r\nregarding it with a finely assumed air of interest, and then looking\r\nat the interlocutor. \"But don't you want to eat it yourself? And\r\nbesides--how did you come by it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It never fades. I have had it now three months. And it is ever bright\r\nand smooth and ripe and desirable, as you see it.\" He laid his hand\r\non his knee and regarded the fruit musingly. Then he began to wrap it\r\nagain in the papers, as though he had abandoned his intention of giving\r\nit away.\r\n\r\n\"But how did you come by it?\" said Mr. Hinchcliff, who had his\r\nargumentative side. \"And how do you know that it _is_ the Fruit of the\r\nTree?\"\r\n\r\n\"I bought this fruit,\" said the stranger, \"three months ago--for a\r\ndrink of water and a crust of bread. The man who gave it to me--because\r\nI kept the life in him--was an Armenian. Armenia! that wonderful\r\ncountry, the first of all countries, where the ark of the Flood\r\nremains to this day, buried in the glaciers of Mount Ararat. This man,\r\nI say, fleeing with others from the Kurds who had come upon them,\r\nwent up into desolate places among the mountains--places beyond the\r\ncommon knowledge of men. And fleeing from imminent pursuit, they\r\ncame to a slope high among the mountain-peaks, green with a grass\r\nlike knife-blades, that cut and slashed most pitilessly at anyone\r\nwho went into it. The Kurds were close behind, and there was nothing\r\nfor it but to plunge in, and the worst of it was that the paths they\r\nmade through it at the price of their blood served for the Kurds to\r\nfollow. Every one of the fugitives was killed save this Armenian and\r\nanother. He heard the screams and cries of his friends, and the swish\r\nof the grass about those who were pursuing them--it was tall grass\r\nrising overhead. And then a shouting and answers, and when presently he\r\npaused, everything was still. He pushed out again, not understanding,\r\ncut and bleeding, until he came out on a steep slope of rocks below a\r\nprecipice, and then he saw the grass was all on fire, and the smoke of\r\nit rose like a veil between him and his enemies.\"\r\n\r\nThe stranger paused. \"Yes?\" said Mr. Hinchcliff. \"Yes?\"\r\n\r\n\"There he was, all torn and bloody from the knife-blades of the grass,\r\nthe rocks blazing under the afternoon sun--the sky molten brass--and\r\nthe smoke of the fire driving towards him. He dared not stay there.\r\nDeath he did not mind, but torture! Far away beyond the smoke he heard\r\nshouts and cries. Women screaming. So he went clambering up a gorge in\r\nthe rocks--everywhere were bushes with dry branches that stuck out like\r\nthorns among the leaves--until he clambered over the brow of a ridge\r\nthat hid him. And then he met his companion, a shepherd, who had also\r\nescaped. And, counting cold and famine and thirst as nothing against\r\nthe Kurds, they went on into the heights, and among the snow and ice.\r\nThey wandered three whole days.\r\n\r\n\"The third day came the vision. I suppose hungry men often do see\r\nvisions, but then there is this fruit.\" He lifted the wrapped globe in\r\nhis hand. \"And I have heard it, too, from other mountaineers who have\r\nknown something of the legend. It was in the evening time, when the\r\nstars were increasing, that they came down a slope of polished rock\r\ninto a huge dark valley all set about with strange, contorted trees,\r\nand in these trees hung little globes like glow-worm spheres, strange\r\nround yellow lights.\r\n\r\n\"Suddenly this valley was lit far away, many miles away, far down it,\r\nwith a golden flame marching slowly athwart it, that made the stunted\r\ntrees against it black as night, and turned the slopes all about them\r\nand their figures to the likeness of fiery gold. And at the vision\r\nthey, knowing the legends of the mountains, instantly knew that it was\r\nEden they saw, or the sentinel of Eden, and they fell upon their faces\r\nlike men struck dead.\r\n\r\n\"When they dared to look again the valley was dark for a space, and\r\nthen the light came again--returning, a burning amber.\r\n\r\n\"At that the shepherd sprang to his feet, and with a shout began to run\r\ndown towards the light, but the other man was too fearful to follow\r\nhim. He stood stunned, amazed, and terrified, watching his companion\r\nrecede towards the marching glare. And hardly had the shepherd set out\r\nwhen there came a noise like thunder, the beating of invisible wings\r\nhurrying up the valley, and a great and terrible fear; and at that\r\nthe man who gave me the fruit turned--if he might still escape. And\r\nhurrying headlong up the slope again, with that tumult sweeping after\r\nhim, he stumbled against one of these stunted bushes, and a ripe fruit\r\ncame off it into his hand. This fruit. Forthwith, the wings and the\r\nthunder rolled all about him. He fell and fainted, and when he came to\r\nhis senses, he was back among the blackened ruins of his own village,\r\nand I and the others were attending to the wounded. A vision? But the\r\ngolden fruit of the tree was still clutched in his hand. There were\r\nothers there who knew the legend, knew what that strange fruit might\r\nbe.\" He paused. \"And this is it,\" he said.\r\n\r\nIt was a most extraordinary story to be told in a third-class carriage\r\non a Sussex railway. It was as if the real was a mere veil to the\r\nfantastic, and here was the fantastic poking through. \"Is it?\" was all\r\nMr. Hinchcliff could say.\r\n\r\n\"The legend,\" said the stranger, \"tells that those thickets of dwarfed\r\ntrees growing about the garden sprang from the apple that Adam carried\r\nin his hand when he and Eve were driven forth. He felt something in\r\nhis hand, saw the half-eaten apple, and flung it petulantly aside.\r\nAnd there they grow, in that desolate valley, girdled round with the\r\neverlasting snows, and there the fiery swords keep ward against the\r\nJudgment Day.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I thought these things were\"--Mr. Hinchcliff\r\npaused--\"fables--parables rather. Do you mean to tell me that there in\r\nArmenia\"--\r\n\r\nThe stranger answered the unfinished question with the fruit in his\r\nopen hand.\r\n\r\n\"But you don't know,\" said Mr. Hinchcliff, \"that that _is_ the fruit\r\nof the Tree of Knowledge. The man may have had--a sort of mirage, say.\r\nSuppose\"--\r\n\r\n\"Look at it,\" said the stranger.\r\n\r\nIt was certainly a strange-looking globe, not really an apple, Mr.\r\nHinchcliff saw, and a curious glowing golden colour, almost as though\r\nlight itself was wrought into its substance. As he looked at it, he\r\nbegan to see more vividly the desolate valley among the mountains, the\r\nguarding swords of fire, the strange antiquities of the story he had\r\njust heard. He rubbed a knuckle into his eye. \"But\"--said he.\r\n\r\n\"It has kept like that, smooth and full, three months. Longer than that\r\nit is now by some days. No drying, no withering, no decay.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you yourself,\" said Mr. Hinchcliff, \"really believe that\"--\r\n\r\n\"Is the Forbidden Fruit.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no mistaking the earnestness of the man's manner and his\r\nperfect sanity. \"The Fruit of Knowledge,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose it was?\" said Mr. Hinchcliff, after a pause, still staring\r\nat it. \"But after all,\" said Mr. Hinchcliff, \"it's not my kind of\r\nknowledge--not the sort of knowledge. I mean, Adam and Eve have eaten\r\nit already.\"\r\n\r\n\"We inherit their sins--not their knowledge,\" said the stranger.\r\n\"That would make it all clear and bright again. We should see\r\ninto everything, through everything, into the deepest meaning of\r\neverything\"--\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you eat it, then?\" said Mr. Hinchcliff, with an inspiration.\r\n\r\n\"I took it intending to eat it,\" said the stranger. \"Man has fallen.\r\nMerely to eat again could scarcely\"--\r\n\r\n\"Knowledge is power,\" said Mr. Hinchcliff.\r\n\r\n\"But is it happiness? I am older than you--more than twice as old.\r\nTime after time I have held this in my hand, and my heart has\r\nfailed me at the thought of all that one might know, that terrible\r\nlucidity-- Suppose suddenly all the world became pitilessly clear?\"\r\n\r\n\"That, I think, would be a great advantage,\" said Mr. Hinchcliff, \"on\r\nthe whole.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose you saw into the hearts and minds of everyone about you, into\r\ntheir most secret recesses--people you loved, whose love you valued?\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd soon find out the humbugs,\" said Mr. Hinchcliff, greatly struck\r\nby the idea.\r\n\r\n\"And worse--to know yourself, bare of your most intimate illusions.\r\nTo see yourself in your place. All that your lusts and weaknesses\r\nprevented your doing. No merciful perspective.\"\r\n\r\n\"That might be an excellent thing too. 'Know thyself,' you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are young,\" said the stranger.\r\n\r\n\"If you don't care to eat it, and it bothers you, why don't you throw\r\nit away?\"\r\n\r\n\"There again, perhaps, you will not understand me. To me, how could one\r\nthrow away a thing like that, glowing, wonderful? Once one has it, one\r\nis bound. But, on the other hand, to _give_ it away! To give it away\r\nto someone who thirsted after knowledge, who found no terror in the\r\nthought of that clear perception\"--\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" said Mr. Hinchcliff thoughtfully, \"it might be some sort\r\nof poisonous fruit.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then his eye caught something motionless, the end of a white board\r\nblack-lettered outside the carriage window. \"--MWOOD,\" he saw. He\r\nstarted convulsively. \"Gracious!\" said Mr. Hinchcliff. \"Holmwood!\"--and\r\nthe practical present blotted out the mystic realisations that had been\r\nstealing upon him.\r\n\r\nIn another moment he was opening the carriage-door, portmanteau in\r\nhand. The guard was already fluttering his green flag. Mr. Hinchcliff\r\njumped out. \"Here!\" said a voice behind him, and he saw the dark eyes\r\nof the stranger shining and the golden fruit, bright and bare, held\r\nout of the open carriage-door. He took it instinctively, the train was\r\nalready moving.\r\n\r\n\"_No!_\" shouted the stranger, and made a snatch at it as if to take it\r\nback.\r\n\r\n\"Stand away,\" cried a country porter, thrusting forward to close the\r\ndoor. The stranger shouted something Mr. Hinchcliff did not catch, head\r\nand arm thrust excitedly out of the window, and then the shadow of the\r\nbridge fell on him, and in a trice he was hidden. Mr. Hinchcliff stood\r\nastonished, staring at the end of the last waggon receding round the\r\nbend, and with the wonderful fruit in his hand. For the fraction of\r\na minute his mind was confused, and then he became aware that two or\r\nthree people on the platform were regarding him with interest. Was he\r\nnot the new Grammar School master making his début? It occurred to him\r\nthat, so far as they could tell, the fruit might very well be the naïve\r\nrefreshment of an orange. He flushed at the thought, and thrust the\r\nfruit into his side pocket, where it bulged undesirably. But there was\r\nno help for it, so he went towards them, awkwardly concealing his sense\r\nof awkwardness, to ask the way to the Grammar School, and the means of\r\ngetting his portmanteau and the two tin boxes which lay up the platform\r\nthither. Of all the odd and fantastic yarns to tell a fellow!\r\n\r\nHis luggage could be taken on a truck for sixpence, he found, and he\r\ncould precede it on foot. He fancied an ironical note in the voices. He\r\nwas painfully aware of his contour.\r\n\r\nThe curious earnestness of the man in the train, and the glamour\r\nof the story he told, had, for a time, diverted the current of Mr.\r\nHinchcliff's thoughts. It drove like a mist before his immediate\r\nconcerns. Fires that went to and fro! But the preoccupation of his\r\nnew position, and the impression he was to produce upon Holmwood\r\ngenerally, and the school people in particular, returned upon him with\r\nreinvigorating power before he left the station and cleared his mental\r\natmosphere. But it is extraordinary what an inconvenient thing the\r\naddition of a soft and rather brightly-golden fruit, not three inches\r\nin diameter, may prove to a sensitive youth on his best appearance.\r\nIn the pocket of his black jacket it bulged dreadfully, spoilt the\r\nlines altogether. He passed a little old lady in black, and he felt\r\nher eye drop upon the excrescence at once. He was wearing one glove\r\nand carrying the other, together with his stick, so that to bear the\r\nfruit openly was impossible. In one place, where the road into the\r\ntown seemed suitably secluded, he took his encumbrance out of his\r\npocket and tried it in his hat. It was just too large, the hat wobbled\r\nludicrously, and just as he was taking it out again, a butcher's boy\r\ncame driving round the corner.\r\n\r\n\"Confound it!\" said Mr. Hinchcliff.\r\n\r\nHe would have eaten the thing, and attained omniscience there and\r\nthen, but it would seem so silly to go into the town sucking a juicy\r\nfruit--and it certainly felt juicy. If one of the boys should come by,\r\nit might do him a serious injury with his discipline so to be seen.\r\nAnd the juice might make his face sticky and get upon his cuffs--or it\r\nmight be an acid juice as potent as lemon, and take all the colour out\r\nof his clothes.\r\n\r\nThen round a bend in the lane came two pleasant sunlit girlish figures.\r\nThey were walking slowly towards the town and chattering--at any\r\nmoment they might look round and see a hot-faced young man behind them\r\ncarrying a kind of phosphorescent yellow tomato! They would be sure to\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n\"_Hang!_\" said Mr. Hinchcliff, and with a swift jerk sent the\r\nencumbrance flying over the stone wall of an orchard that there abutted\r\non the road. As it vanished, he felt a faint twinge of loss that lasted\r\nscarcely a moment. He adjusted the stick and glove in his hand, and\r\nwalked on, erect and self-conscious, to pass the girls.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut in the darkness of the night Mr. Hinchcliff had a dream, and saw\r\nthe valley, and the flaming swords, and the contorted trees, and knew\r\nthat it really was the Apple of the Tree of Knowledge that he had\r\nthrown regardlessly away. And he awoke very unhappy.\r\n\r\nIn the morning his regret had passed, but afterwards it returned and\r\ntroubled him; never, however, when he was happy or busily occupied. At\r\nlast, one moonlight night about eleven, when all Holmwood was quiet,\r\nhis regrets returned with redoubled force, and therewith an impulse to\r\nadventure. He slipped out of the house and over the playground wall,\r\nwent through the silent town to Station Lane, and climbed into the\r\norchard where he had thrown the fruit. But nothing was to be found\r\nof it there among the dewy grass and the faint intangible globes of\r\ndandelion down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNDER THE KNIFE\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What if I die under it?\" The thought recurred again and again, as I\r\nwalked home from Haddon's. It was a purely personal question. I was\r\nspared the deep anxieties of a married man, and I knew there were few\r\nof my intimate friends but would find my death troublesome chiefly on\r\naccount of their duty of regret. I was surprised indeed, and perhaps\r\na little humiliated, as I turned the matter over, to think how few\r\ncould possibly exceed the conventional requirement. Things came\r\nbefore me stripped of glamour, in a clear dry light, during that walk\r\nfrom Haddon's house over Primrose Hill. There were the friends of my\r\nyouth: I perceived now that our affection was a tradition, which we\r\nforegathered rather laboriously to maintain. There were the rivals\r\nand helpers of my later career: I suppose I had been cold-blooded or\r\nundemonstrative--one perhaps implies the other. It may be that even the\r\ncapacity for friendship is a question of physique. There had been a\r\ntime in my own life when I had grieved bitterly enough at the loss of\r\na friend; but as I walked home that afternoon the emotional side of my\r\nimagination was dormant. I could not pity myself, nor feel sorry for\r\nmy friends, nor conceive of them as grieving for me.\r\n\r\nI was interested in this deadness of my emotional nature--no doubt\r\na concomitant of my stagnating physiology; and my thoughts wandered\r\noff along the line it suggested. Once before, in my hot youth, I\r\nhad suffered a sudden loss of blood, and had been within an ace of\r\ndeath. I remembered now that my affections as well as my passions had\r\ndrained out of me, leaving scarce anything but a tranquil resignation,\r\na dreg of self-pity. It had been weeks before the old ambitions,\r\nand tendernesses, and all the complex moral interplay of a man, had\r\nreasserted themselves. It occurred to me that the real meaning of\r\nthis numbness might be a gradual slipping away from the pleasure-pain\r\nguidance of the animal man. It has been proven, I take it, as\r\nthoroughly as anything can be proven in this world, that the higher\r\nemotions, the moral feelings, even the subtle tendernesses of love, are\r\nevolved from the elemental desires and fears of the simple animal: they\r\nare the harness in which man's mental freedom goes. And it may be that,\r\nas death overshadows us, as our possibility of acting diminishes, this\r\ncomplex growth of balanced impulse, propensity, and aversion, whose\r\ninterplay inspires our acts, goes with it. Leaving what?\r\n\r\nI was suddenly brought back to reality by an imminent collision with\r\na butcher-boy's tray. I found that I was crossing the bridge over the\r\nRegent's Park Canal, which runs parallel with that in the Zoological\r\nGardens. The boy in blue had been looking over his shoulder at a black\r\nbarge advancing slowly, towed by a gaunt white horse. In the Gardens\r\na nurse was leading three happy little children over the bridge. The\r\ntrees were bright green; the spring hopefulness was still unstained by\r\nthe dusts of summer; the sky in the water was bright and clear, but\r\nbroken by long waves, by quivering bands of black, as the barge drove\r\nthrough. The breeze was stirring; but it did not stir me as the spring\r\nbreeze used to do.\r\n\r\nWas this dulness of feeling in itself an anticipation? It was curious\r\nthat I could reason and follow out a network of suggestion as clearly\r\nas ever: so, at least, it seemed to me. It was calmness rather than\r\ndulness that was coming upon me. Was there any ground for the belief in\r\nthe presentiment of death? Did a man near to death begin instinctively\r\nto withdraw himself from the meshes of matter and sense, even before\r\nthe cold hand was laid upon his? I felt strangely isolated--isolated\r\nwithout regret--from the life and existence about me. The children\r\nplaying in the sun and gathering strength and experience for the\r\nbusiness of life, the park-keeper gossiping with a nursemaid, the\r\nnursing mother, the young couple intent upon each other as they passed\r\nme, the trees by the wayside spreading new pleading leaves to the\r\nsunlight, the stir in their branches--I had been part of it all, but I\r\nhad nearly done with it now.\r\n\r\nSome way down the Broad Walk I perceived that I was tired, and that my\r\nfeet were heavy. It was hot that afternoon, and I turned aside and sat\r\ndown on one of the green chairs that line the way. In a minute I had\r\ndozed into a dream, and the tide of my thoughts washed up a vision\r\nof the resurrection. I was still sitting in the chair, but I thought\r\nmyself actually dead, withered, tattered, dried, one eye (I saw) pecked\r\nout by birds. \"Awake!\" cried a voice; and incontinently the dust of the\r\npath and the mould under the grass became insurgent. I had never before\r\nthought of Regent's Park as a cemetery, but now, through the trees,\r\nstretching as far as eye could see, I beheld a flat plain of writhing\r\ngraves and heeling tombstones. There seemed to be some trouble: the\r\nrising dead appeared to stifle as they struggled upward, they bled in\r\ntheir struggles, the red flesh was tattered away from the white bones.\r\n\"Awake!\" cried a voice; but I determined I would not rise to such\r\nhorrors. \"Awake!\" They would not let me alone. \"Wike up!\" said an angry\r\nvoice. A cockney angel! The man who sells the tickets was shaking me,\r\ndemanding my penny.\r\n\r\nI paid my penny, pocketed my ticket, yawned, stretched my legs, and,\r\nfeeling now rather less torpid, got up and walked on towards Langham\r\nPlace. I speedily lost myself again in a shifting maze of thoughts\r\nabout death. Going across Marylebone Road into that crescent at the end\r\nof Langham Place, I had the narrowest escape from the shaft of a cab,\r\nand went on my way with a palpitating heart and a bruised shoulder. It\r\nstruck me that it would have been curious if my meditations on my death\r\non the morrow had led to my death that day.\r\n\r\nBut I will not weary you with more of my experiences that day and\r\nthe next. I knew more and more certainly that I should die under the\r\noperation; at times I think I was inclined to pose to myself. The\r\ndoctors were coming at eleven, and I did not get up. It seemed scarce\r\nworth while to trouble about washing and dressing, and though I read\r\nmy newspapers and the letters that came by the first post, I did not\r\nfind them very interesting. There was a friendly note from Addison,\r\nmy old school friend, calling my attention to two discrepancies and\r\na printer's error in my new book, with one from Langridge venting\r\nsome vexation over Minton. The rest were business communications. I\r\nbreakfasted in bed. The glow of pain at my side seemed more massive.\r\nI knew it was pain, and yet, if you can understand, I did not find it\r\nvery painful. I had been awake and hot and thirsty in the night, but in\r\nthe morning bed felt comfortable. In the night-time I had lain thinking\r\nof things that were past; in the morning I dozed over the question of\r\nimmortality. Haddon came, punctual to the minute, with a neat black\r\nbag; and Mowbray soon followed. Their arrival stirred me up a little. I\r\nbegan to take a more personal interest in the proceedings. Haddon moved\r\nthe little octagonal table close to the bedside, and, with his broad\r\nblack back to me, began taking things out of his bag. I heard the light\r\nclick of steel upon steel. My imagination, I found, was not altogether\r\nstagnant. \"Will you hurt me much?\" I said in an off-hand tone.\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit,\" Haddon answered over his shoulder. \"We shall chloroform\r\nyou. Your heart's as sound as a bell.\" And as he spoke, I had a whiff\r\nof the pungent sweetness of the anæsthetic.\r\n\r\nThey stretched me out, with a convenient exposure of my side, and,\r\nalmost before I realised what was happening, the chloroform was being\r\nadministered. It stings the nostrils, and there is a suffocating\r\nsensation, at first. I knew I should die--that this was the end of\r\nconsciousness for me. And suddenly I felt that I was not prepared for\r\ndeath: I had a vague sense of a duty overlooked--I knew not what. What\r\nwas it I had not done? I could think of nothing more to do, nothing\r\ndesirable left in life; and yet I had the strangest disinclination\r\nto death. And the physical sensation was painfully oppressive. Of\r\ncourse the doctors did not know they were going to kill me. Possibly\r\nI struggled. Then I fell motionless, and a great silence, a monstrous\r\nsilence, and an impenetrable blackness came upon me.\r\n\r\nThere must have been an interval of absolute unconsciousness,\r\nseconds or minutes. Then, with a chilly, unemotional clearness, I\r\nperceived that I was not yet dead. I was still in my body; but all the\r\nmultitudinous sensations that come sweeping from it to make up the\r\nbackground of consciousness had gone, leaving me free of it all. No,\r\nnot free of it all; for as yet something still held me to the poor\r\nstark flesh upon the bed--held me, yet not so closely that I did not\r\nfeel myself external to it, independent of it, straining away from it.\r\nI do not think I saw, I do not think I heard; but I perceived all that\r\nwas going on, and it was as if I both heard and saw. Haddon was bending\r\nover me, Mowbray behind me; the scalpel--it was a large scalpel--was\r\ncutting my flesh at the side under the flying ribs. It was interesting\r\nto see myself cut like cheese, without a pang, without even a qualm.\r\nThe interest was much of a quality with that one might feel in a game\r\nof chess between strangers. Haddon's face was firm and his hand steady;\r\nbut I was surprised to perceive (_how_ I know not) that he was feeling\r\nthe gravest doubt as to his own wisdom in the conduct of the operation.\r\n\r\nMowbray's thoughts, too, I could see. He was thinking that Haddon's\r\nmanner showed too much of the specialist. New suggestions came up like\r\nbubbles through a stream of frothing meditation, and burst one after\r\nanother in the little bright spot of his consciousness. He could not\r\nhelp noticing and admiring Haddon's swift dexterity, in spite of his\r\nenvious quality and his disposition to detract. I saw my liver exposed.\r\nI was puzzled at my own condition. I did not feel that I was dead, but\r\nI was different in some way from my living self. The grey depression,\r\nthat had weighed on me for a year or more and coloured all my thoughts,\r\nwas gone. I perceived and thought without any emotional tint at all.\r\nI wondered if everyone perceived things in this way under chloroform,\r\nand forgot it again when he came out of it. It would be inconvenient to\r\nlook into some heads, and not forget.\r\n\r\nAlthough I did not think that I was dead, I still perceived quite\r\nclearly that I was soon to die. This brought me back to the\r\nconsideration of Haddon's proceedings. I looked into his mind, and\r\nsaw that he was afraid of cutting a branch of the portal vein. My\r\nattention was distracted from details by the curious changes going on\r\nin his mind. His consciousness was like the quivering little spot of\r\nlight which is thrown by the mirror of a galvanometer. His thoughts\r\nran under it like a stream, some through the focus bright and distinct,\r\nsome shadowy in the half-light of the edge. Just now the little glow\r\nwas steady; but the least movement on Mowbray's part, the slightest\r\nsound from outside, even a faint difference in the slow movement of\r\nthe living flesh he was cutting, set the light-spot shivering and\r\nspinning. A new sense-impression came rushing up through the flow of\r\nthoughts; and lo! the light-spot jerked away towards it, swifter than\r\na frightened fish. It was wonderful to think that upon that unstable,\r\nfitful thing depended all the complex motions of the man; that for\r\nthe next five minutes, therefore, my life hung upon its movements.\r\nAnd he was growing more and more nervous in his work. It was as if a\r\nlittle picture of a cut vein grew brighter, and struggled to oust from\r\nhis brain another picture of a cut falling short of the mark. He was\r\nafraid: his dread of cutting too little was battling with his dread of\r\ncutting too far.\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly, like an escape of water from under a lock-gate, a\r\ngreat uprush of horrible realisation set all his thoughts swirling,\r\nand simultaneously I perceived that the vein was cut. He started back\r\nwith a hoarse exclamation, and I saw the brown-purple blood gather\r\nin a swift bead, and run trickling. He was horrified. He pitched the\r\nred-stained scalpel on to the octagonal table; and instantly both\r\ndoctors flung themselves upon me, making hasty and ill-conceived\r\nefforts to remedy the disaster. \"Ice!\" said Mowbray, gasping. But I\r\nknew that I was killed, though my body still clung to me.\r\n\r\nI will not describe their belated endeavours to save me, though I\r\nperceived every detail. My perceptions were sharper and swifter\r\nthan they had ever been in life; my thoughts rushed through my mind\r\nwith incredible swiftness, but with perfect definition. I can only\r\ncompare their crowded clarity to the effects of a reasonable dose\r\nof opium. In a moment it would all be over, and I should be free. I\r\nknew I was immortal, but what would happen I did not know. Should I\r\ndrift off presently, like a puff of smoke from a gun, in some kind of\r\nhalf-material body, an attenuated version of my material self? Should\r\nI find myself suddenly among the innumerable hosts of the dead, and\r\nknow the world about me for the phantasmagoria it had always seemed?\r\nShould I drift to some spiritualistic _séance_, and there make foolish,\r\nincomprehensible attempts to affect a purblind medium? It was a\r\nstate of unemotional curiosity, of colourless expectation. And then\r\nI realised a growing stress upon me, a feeling as though some huge\r\nhuman magnet was drawing me upward out of my body. The stress grew and\r\ngrew. I seemed an atom for which monstrous forces were fighting. For\r\none brief, terrible moment sensation came back to me. That feeling of\r\nfalling headlong which comes in nightmares, that feeling a thousand\r\ntimes intensified, that and a black horror swept across my thoughts in\r\na torrent. Then the two doctors, the naked body with its cut side, the\r\nlittle room, swept away from under me and vanished, as a speck of foam\r\nvanishes down an eddy.\r\n\r\nI was in mid-air. Far below was the West End of London, receding\r\nrapidly,--for I seemed to be flying swiftly upward,--and, as it\r\nreceded, passing westward, like a panorama. I could see, through the\r\nfaint haze of smoke, the innumerable roofs chimney-set, the narrow\r\nroadways, stippled with people and conveyances, the little specks\r\nof squares, and the church steeples like thorns sticking out of the\r\nfabric. But it spun away as the earth rotated on its axis, and in a\r\nfew seconds (as it seemed) I was over the scattered clumps of town\r\nabout Ealing, the little Thames a thread of blue to the south, and the\r\nChiltern Hills and the North Downs coming up like the rim of a basin,\r\nfar away and faint with haze. Up I rushed. And at first I had not the\r\nfaintest conception what this headlong rush upward could mean.\r\n\r\nEvery moment the circle of scenery beneath me grew wider and wider,\r\nand the details of town and field, of hill and valley, got more and\r\nmore hazy and pale and indistinct, a luminous grey was mingled more\r\nand more with the blue of the hills and the green of the open meadows;\r\nand a little patch of cloud, low and far to the west, shone ever more\r\ndazzlingly white. Above, as the veil of atmosphere between myself and\r\nouter space grew thinner, the sky, which had been a fair springtime\r\nblue at first, grew deeper and richer in colour, passing steadily\r\nthrough the intervening shades, until presently it was as dark as\r\nthe blue sky of midnight, and presently as black as the blackness of\r\na frosty starlight, and at last as black as no blackness I had ever\r\nbeheld. And first one star, and then many, and at last an innumerable\r\nhost broke out upon the sky: more stars than anyone has ever seen from\r\nthe face of the earth. For the blueness of the sky is the light of the\r\nsun and stars sifted and spread abroad blindingly: there is diffused\r\nlight even in the darkest skies of winter, and we do not see the stars\r\nby day only because of the dazzling irradiation of the sun. But now I\r\nsaw things--I know not how; assuredly with no mortal eyes--and that\r\ndefect of bedazzlement blinded me no longer. The sun was incredibly\r\nstrange and wonderful. The body of it was a disc of blinding white\r\nlight: not yellowish, as it seems to those who live upon the earth, but\r\nlivid white, all streaked with scarlet streaks and rimmed about with a\r\nfringe of writhing tongues of red fire. And, shooting half-way across\r\nthe heavens from either side of it, and brighter than the Milky Way,\r\nwere two pinions of silver-white, making it look more like those winged\r\nglobes I have seen in Egyptian sculpture, than anything else I can\r\nremember upon earth. These I knew for the solar corona, though I had\r\nnever seen anything of it but a picture during the days of my earthly\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nWhen my attention came back to the earth again, I saw that it\r\nhad fallen very far away from me. Field and town were long since\r\nindistinguishable, and all the varied hues of the country were merging\r\ninto a uniform bright grey, broken only by the brilliant white of the\r\nclouds that lay scattered in flocculent masses over Ireland and the\r\nwest of England. For now I could see the outlines of the north of\r\nFrance and Ireland, and all this island of Britain, save where Scotland\r\npassed over the horizon to the north, or where the coast was blurred\r\nor obliterated by cloud. The sea was a dull grey, and darker than the\r\nland; and the whole panorama was rotating slowly towards the east.\r\n\r\nAll this had happened so swiftly that, until I was some thousand miles\r\nor so from the earth, I had no thought for myself. But now I perceived\r\nI had neither hands nor feet, neither parts nor organs, and that I felt\r\nneither alarm nor pain. All about me I perceived that the vacancy (for\r\nI had already left the air behind) was cold beyond the imagination of\r\nman; but it troubled me not. The sun's rays shot through the void,\r\npowerless to light or heat until they should strike on matter in their\r\ncourse. I saw things with a serene self-forgetfulness, even as if I\r\nwere God. And down below there, rushing away from me,--countless miles\r\nin a second,--where a little dark spot on the grey marked the position\r\nof London, two doctors were struggling to restore life to the poor\r\nhacked and outworn shell I had abandoned. I felt then such release,\r\nsuch serenity as I can compare to no mortal delight I have ever known.\r\n\r\nIt was only after I had perceived all these things that the meaning of\r\nthat headlong rush of the earth grew into comprehension. Yet it was\r\nso simple, so obvious, that I was amazed at my never anticipating the\r\nthing that was happening to me. I had suddenly been cut adrift from\r\nmatter: all that was material of me was there upon earth, whirling\r\naway through space, held to the earth by gravitation, partaking of the\r\nearth-inertia, moving in its wreath of epicycles round the sun, and\r\nwith the sun and the planets on their vast march through space. But\r\nthe immaterial has no inertia, feels nothing of the pull of matter\r\nfor matter: where it parts from its garment of flesh, there it remains\r\n(so far as space concerns it any longer) immovable in space. I was not\r\nleaving the earth: the earth was leaving _me_, and not only the earth,\r\nbut the whole solar system was streaming past. And about me in space,\r\ninvisible to me, scattered in the wake of the earth upon its journey,\r\nthere must be an innumerable multitude of souls, stripped like myself\r\nof the material, stripped like myself of the passions of the individual\r\nand the generous emotions of the gregarious brute, naked intelligences,\r\nthings of newborn wonder and thought, marvelling at the strange release\r\nthat had suddenly come on them!\r\n\r\nAs I receded faster and faster from the strange white sun in the black\r\nheavens, and from the broad and shining earth upon which my being had\r\nbegun, I seemed to grow, in some incredible manner, vast: vast as\r\nregards this world I had left, vast as regards the moments and periods\r\nof a human life. Very soon I saw the full circle of the earth, slightly\r\ngibbous, like the moon when she nears her full, but very large; and\r\nthe silvery shape of America was now in the noonday blaze wherein (as\r\nit seemed) little England had been basking but a few minutes ago. At\r\nfirst the earth was large, and shone in the heavens, filling a great\r\npart of them; but every moment she grew smaller and more distant. As\r\nshe shrunk, the broad moon in its third quarter crept into view over\r\nthe rim of her disc. I looked for the constellations. Only that part of\r\nAries directly behind the sun and the Lion, which the earth covered,\r\nwere hidden. I recognised the tortuous, tattered band of the Milky\r\nWay, with Vega very bright between sun and earth; and Sirius and Orion\r\nshone splendid against the unfathomable blackness in the opposite\r\nquarter of the heavens. The Pole Star was overhead, and the Great Bear\r\nhung over the circle of the earth. And away beneath and beyond the\r\nshining corona of the sun were strange groupings of stars I had never\r\nseen in my life--notably, a dagger-shaped group that I knew for the\r\nSouthern Cross. All these were no larger than when they had shone on\r\nearth; but the little stars that one scarce sees shone now against the\r\nsetting of black vacancy as brightly as the first-magnitudes had done,\r\nwhile the larger worlds were points of indescribable glory and colour.\r\nAldebaran was a spot of blood-red fire, and Sirius condensed to one\r\npoint the light of a world of sapphires. And they shone steadily: they\r\ndid not scintillate, they were calmly glorious. My impressions had an\r\nadamantine hardness and brightness: there was no blurring softness,\r\nno atmosphere, nothing but infinite darkness set with the myriads of\r\nthese acute and brilliant points and specks of light. Presently, when\r\nI looked again, the little earth seemed no bigger than the sun, and\r\nit dwindled and turned as I looked, until, in a second's space (as it\r\nseemed to me), it was halved; and so it went on swiftly dwindling. Far\r\naway in the opposite direction, a little pinkish pin's head of light,\r\nshining steadily, was the planet Mars. I swam motionless in vacancy,\r\nand, without a trace of terror or astonishment, watched the speck of\r\ncosmic dust we call the world fall away from me.\r\n\r\nPresently it dawned upon me that my sense of duration had changed: that\r\nmy mind was moving not faster but infinitely slower, that between each\r\nseparate impression there was a period of many days. The moon spun once\r\nround the earth as I noted this; and I perceived clearly the motion of\r\nMars in his orbit. Moreover, it appeared as if the time between thought\r\nand thought grew steadily greater, until at last a thousand years was\r\nbut a moment in my perception.\r\n\r\nAt first the constellations had shone motionless against the black\r\nbackground of infinite space; but presently it seemed as though the\r\ngroup of stars about Hercules and the Scorpion was contracting, while\r\nOrion and Aldebaran and their neighbours were scattering apart.\r\nFlashing suddenly out of the darkness there came a flying multitude\r\nof particles of rock, glittering like dust-specks in a sunbeam, and\r\nencompassed in a faintly luminous haze. They swirled all about me,\r\nand vanished again in a twinkling far behind. And then I saw that a\r\nbright spot of light, that shone a little to one side of my path, was\r\ngrowing very rapidly larger, and perceived that it was the planet\r\nSaturn rushing towards me. Larger and larger it grew, swallowing up the\r\nheavens behind it, and hiding every moment a fresh multitude of stars.\r\nI perceived its flattened, whirling body, its disc-like belt, and seven\r\nof its little satellites. It grew and grew, till it towered enormous;\r\nand then I plunged amid a streaming multitude of clashing stones and\r\ndancing dust-particles and gas-eddies, and saw for a moment the mighty\r\ntriple belt like three concentric arches of moonlight above me, its\r\nshadow black on the boiling tumult below. These things happened in\r\none-tenth of the time it takes to tell of them. The planet went by like\r\na flash of lightning; for a few seconds it blotted out the sun, and\r\nthere and then became a mere black, dwindling, winged patch against the\r\nlight. The earth, the mother mote of my being, I could no longer see.\r\n\r\nSo, with a stately swiftness, in the profoundest silence, the solar\r\nsystem fell from me, as it had been a garment, until the sun was a mere\r\nstar amid the multitude of stars, with its eddy of planet-specks, lost\r\nin the confused glittering of the remoter light. I was no longer a\r\ndenizen of the solar system: I had come to the Outer Universe, I seemed\r\nto grasp and comprehend the whole world of matter. Ever more swiftly\r\nthe stars closed in about the spot where Antares and Vega had vanished\r\nin a luminous haze, until that part of the sky had the semblance of\r\na whirling mass of nebulæ, and ever before me yawned vaster gaps of\r\nvacant blackness, and the stars shone fewer and fewer. It seemed as if\r\nI moved towards a point between Orion's belt and sword; and the void\r\nabout that region opened vaster and vaster every second, an incredible\r\ngulf of nothingness, into which I was falling. Faster and ever faster\r\nthe universe rushed by, a hurry of whirling motes at last, speeding\r\nsilently into the void. Stars glowing brighter and brighter, with\r\ntheir circling planets catching the light in a ghostly fashion as I\r\nneared them, shone out and vanished again into inexistence; faint\r\ncomets, clusters of meteorites, winking specks of matter, eddying light\r\npoints, whizzed past, some perhaps a hundred millions of miles or so\r\nfrom me at most, few nearer, travelling with unimaginable rapidity,\r\nshooting constellations, momentary darts of fire, through that black,\r\nenormous night. More than anything else it was like a dusty draught,\r\nsunbeam-lit. Broader, and wider, and deeper grew the starless space,\r\nthe vacant Beyond, into which I was being drawn. At last a quarter of\r\nthe heavens was black and blank, and the whole headlong rush of stellar\r\nuniverse closed in behind me like a veil of light that is gathered\r\ntogether. It drove away from me like a monstrous jack-o'-lantern driven\r\nby the wind. I had come out into the wilderness of space. Ever the\r\nvacant blackness grew broader, until the hosts of the stars seemed\r\nonly like a swarm of fiery specks hurrying away from me, inconceivably\r\nremote, and the darkness, the nothingness and emptiness, was about me\r\non every side. Soon the little universe of matter, the cage of points\r\nin which I had begun to be, was dwindling, now to a whirling disc of\r\nluminous glittering, and now to one minute disc of hazy light. In a\r\nlittle while it would shrink to a point, and at last would vanish\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nSuddenly feeling came back to me--feeling in the shape of overwhelming\r\nterror: such a dread of those dark vastitudes as no words can describe,\r\na passionate resurgence of sympathy and social desire. Were there\r\nother souls, invisible to me as I to them, about me in the blackness?\r\nor was I indeed, even as I felt, alone? Had I passed out of being\r\ninto something that was neither being nor not-being? The covering\r\nof the body, the covering of matter, had been torn from me, and the\r\nhallucinations of companionship and security. Everything was black and\r\nsilent. I had ceased to be. I was nothing. There was nothing, save only\r\nthat infinitesimal dot of light that dwindled in the gulf. I strained\r\nmyself to hear and see, and for a while there was naught but infinite\r\nsilence, intolerable darkness, horror, and despair.\r\n\r\nThen I saw that about the spot of light into which the whole world of\r\nmatter had shrunk there was a faint glow. And in a band on either side\r\nof that the darkness was not absolute. I watched it for ages, as it\r\nseemed to me, and through the long waiting the haze grew imperceptibly\r\nmore distinct. And then about the band appeared an irregular cloud\r\nof the faintest, palest brown. I felt a passionate impatience; but\r\nthe things grew brighter so slowly that they scarce seemed to change.\r\nWhat was unfolding itself? What was this strange reddish dawn in the\r\ninterminable night of space?\r\n\r\nThe cloud's shape was grotesque. It seemed to be looped along its lower\r\nside into four projecting masses, and, above, it ended in a straight\r\nline. What phantom was it? I felt assured I had seen that figure\r\nbefore; but I could not think what, nor where, nor when it was. Then\r\nthe realisation rushed upon me. _It was a clenched Hand._ I was alone\r\nin space, alone with this huge, shadowy Hand, upon which the whole\r\nUniverse of Matter lay like an unconsidered speck of dust. It seemed\r\nas though I watched it through vast periods of time. On the forefinger\r\nglittered a ring; and the universe from which I had come was but a spot\r\nof light upon the ring's curvature. And the thing that the hand gripped\r\nhad the likeness of a black rod. Through a long eternity I watched\r\nthis Hand, with the ring and the rod, marvelling and fearing and\r\nwaiting helplessly on what might follow. It seemed as though nothing\r\ncould follow: that I should watch for ever, seeing only the Hand and\r\nthe thing it held, and understanding nothing of its import. Was the\r\nwhole universe but a refracting speck upon some greater Being? Were our\r\nworlds but the atoms of another universe, and those again of another,\r\nand so on through an endless progression? And what was I? Was I indeed\r\nimmaterial? A vague persuasion of a body gathering about me came into\r\nmy suspense. The abysmal darkness about the Hand filled with impalpable\r\nsuggestions, with uncertain, fluctuating shapes.\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly, came a sound, like the sound of a tolling bell: faint,\r\nas if infinitely far; muffled, as though heard through thick swathings\r\nof darkness: a deep, vibrating resonance, with vast gulfs of silence\r\nbetween each stroke. And the Hand appeared to tighten on the rod. And\r\nI saw far above the Hand, towards the apex of the darkness, a circle\r\nof dim phosphorescence, a ghostly sphere whence these sounds came\r\nthrobbing; and at the last stroke the Hand vanished, for the hour had\r\ncome, and I heard a noise of many waters. But the black rod remained\r\nas a great band across the sky. And then a voice, which seemed to run\r\nto the uttermost parts of space, spoke, saying, \"There will be no more\r\npain.\"\r\n\r\nAt that an almost intolerable gladness and radiance rushed in upon\r\nme, and I saw the circle shining white and bright, and the rod black\r\nand shining, and many things else distinct and clear. And the circle\r\nwas the face of the clock, and the rod the rail of my bed. Haddon was\r\nstanding at the foot, against the rail, with a small pair of scissors\r\non his fingers; and the hands of my clock on the mantel over his\r\nshoulder were clasped together over the hour of twelve. Mowbray was\r\nwashing something in a basin at the octagonal table, and at my side I\r\nfelt a subdued feeling that could scarce be spoken of as pain.\r\n\r\nThe operation had not killed me. And I perceived, suddenly, that the\r\ndull melancholy of half a year was lifted from my mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEA RAIDERS\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nUntil the extraordinary affair at Sidmouth, the peculiar species\r\n_Haploteuthis ferox_ was known to science only generically, on the\r\nstrength of a half-digested tentacle obtained near the Azores, and a\r\ndecaying body pecked by birds and nibbled by fish, found early in 1896\r\nby Mr. Jennings, near Land's End.\r\n\r\nIn no department of zoological science, indeed, are we quite so much in\r\nthe dark as with regard to the deep-sea cephalopods. A mere accident,\r\nfor instance, it was that led to the Prince of Monaco's discovery\r\nof nearly a dozen new forms in the summer of 1895, a discovery in\r\nwhich the before-mentioned tentacle was included. It chanced that\r\na cachalot was killed off Terceira by some sperm whalers, and in\r\nits last struggles charged almost to the Prince's yacht, missed it,\r\nrolled under, and died within twenty yards of his rudder. And in its\r\nagony it threw up a number of large objects, which the Prince, dimly\r\nperceiving they were strange and important, was, by a happy expedient,\r\nable to secure before they sank. He set his screws in motion, and\r\nkept them circling in the vortices thus created until a boat could\r\nbe lowered. And these specimens were whole cephalopods and fragments\r\nof cephalopods, some of gigantic proportions, and almost all of them\r\nunknown to science!\r\n\r\nIt would seem, indeed, that these large and agile creatures, living\r\nin the middle depths of the sea, must, to a large extent, for ever\r\nremain unknown to us, since under water they are too nimble for nets,\r\nand it is only by such rare unlooked-for accidents that specimens\r\ncan be obtained. In the case of _Haploteuthis ferox_, for instance,\r\nwe are still altogether ignorant of its habitat, as ignorant as we\r\nare of the breeding-ground of the herring or the sea-ways of the\r\nsalmon. And zoologists are altogether at a loss to account for its\r\nsudden appearance on our coast. Possibly it was the stress of a hunger\r\nmigration that drove it hither out of the deep. But it will be,\r\nperhaps, better to avoid necessarily inconclusive discussion, and to\r\nproceed at once with our narrative.\r\n\r\nThe first human being to set eyes upon a living _Haploteuthis_--the\r\nfirst human being to survive, that is, for there can be little doubt\r\nnow that the wave of bathing fatalities and boating accidents that\r\ntravelled along the coast of Cornwall and Devon in early May was due\r\nto this cause--was a retired tea-dealer of the name of Fison, who was\r\nstopping at a Sidmouth boarding-house. It was in the afternoon, and he\r\nwas walking along the cliff path between Sidmouth and Ladram Bay. The\r\ncliffs in this direction are very high, but down the red face of them\r\nin one place a kind of ladder staircase has been made. He was near\r\nthis when his attention was attracted by what at first he thought to\r\nbe a cluster of birds struggling over a fragment of food that caught\r\nthe sunlight, and glistened pinkish-white. The tide was right out, and\r\nthis object was not only far below him, but remote across a broad waste\r\nof rock reefs covered with dark seaweed and interspersed with silvery\r\nshining tidal pools. And he was, moreover, dazzled by the brightness of\r\nthe further water.\r\n\r\nIn a minute, regarding this again, he perceived that his judgment was\r\nin fault, for over this struggle circled a number of birds, jackdaws\r\nand gulls for the most part, the latter gleaming blindingly when the\r\nsunlight smote their wings, and they seemed minute in comparison with\r\nit. And his curiosity was, perhaps, aroused all the more strongly\r\nbecause of his first insufficient explanations.\r\n\r\nAs he had nothing better to do than amuse himself, he decided to make\r\nthis object, whatever it was, the goal of his afternoon walk, instead\r\nof Ladram Bay, conceiving it might perhaps be a great fish of some\r\nsort, stranded by some chance, and flapping about in its distress. And\r\nso he hurried down the long steep ladder, stopping at intervals of\r\nthirty feet or so to take breath and scan the mysterious movement.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the cliff he was, of course, nearer his object than\r\nhe had been; but, on the other hand, it now came up against the\r\nincandescent sky, beneath the sun, so as to seem dark and indistinct.\r\nWhatever was pinkish of it was now hidden by a skerry of weedy\r\nboulders. But he perceived that it was made up of seven rounded bodies,\r\ndistinct or connected, and that the birds kept up a constant croaking\r\nand screaming, but seemed afraid to approach it too closely.\r\n\r\nMr. Fison, torn by curiosity, began picking his way across the\r\nwave-worn rocks, and, finding the wet seaweed that covered them thickly\r\nrendered them extremely slippery, he stopped, removed his shoes and\r\nsocks, and coiled his trousers above his knees. His object was, of\r\ncourse, merely to avoid stumbling into the rocky pools about him, and\r\nperhaps he was rather glad, as all men are, of an excuse to resume,\r\neven for a moment, the sensations of his boyhood. At anyrate, it is to\r\nthis, no doubt, that he owes his life.\r\n\r\nHe approached his mark with all the assurance which the absolute\r\nsecurity of this country against all forms of animal life gives its\r\ninhabitants. The round bodies moved to and fro, but it was only when he\r\nsurmounted the skerry of boulders I have mentioned that he realised the\r\nhorrible nature of the discovery. It came upon him with some suddenness.\r\n\r\nThe rounded bodies fell apart as he came into sight over the ridge,\r\nand displayed the pinkish object to be the partially devoured body of\r\na human being, but whether of a man or woman he was unable to say.\r\nAnd the rounded bodies were new and ghastly-looking creatures, in\r\nshape somewhat resembling an octopus, and with huge and very long and\r\nflexible tentacles, coiled copiously on the ground. The skin had a\r\nglistening texture, unpleasant to see, like shiny leather. The downward\r\nbend of the tentacle-surrounded mouth, the curious excrescence at the\r\nbend, the tentacles, and the large intelligent eyes, gave the creatures\r\na grotesque suggestion of a face. They were the size of a fair-sized\r\nswine about the body, and the tentacles seemed to him to be many feet\r\nin length. There were, he thinks, seven or eight at least of the\r\ncreatures. Twenty yards beyond them, amid the surf of the now returning\r\ntide, two others were emerging from the sea.\r\n\r\nTheir bodies lay flatly on the rocks, and their eyes regarded him with\r\nevil interest; but it does not appear that Mr. Fison was afraid, or\r\nthat he realised that he was in any danger. Possibly his confidence\r\nis to be ascribed to the limpness of their attitudes. But he was\r\nhorrified, of course, and intensely excited and indignant at such\r\nrevolting creatures preying upon human flesh. He thought they had\r\nchanced upon a drowned body. He shouted to them, with the idea of\r\ndriving them off, and, finding they did not budge, cast about him,\r\npicked up a big rounded lump of rock, and flung it at one.\r\n\r\nAnd then, slowly uncoiling their tentacles, they all began moving\r\ntowards him--creeping at first deliberately, and making a soft purring\r\nsound to each other.\r\n\r\nIn a moment Mr. Fison realised that he was in danger. He shouted again,\r\nthrew both his boots, and started off, with a leap, forthwith. Twenty\r\nyards off he stopped and faced about, judging them slow, and behold!\r\nthe tentacles of their leader were already pouring over the rocky\r\nridge on which he had just been standing!\r\n\r\nAt that he shouted again, but this time not threatening, but a cry\r\nof dismay, and began jumping, striding, slipping, wading across the\r\nuneven expanse between him and the beach. The tall red cliffs seemed\r\nsuddenly at a vast distance, and he saw, as though they were creatures\r\nin another world, two minute workmen engaged in the repair of the\r\nladder-way, and little suspecting the race for life that was beginning\r\nbelow them. At one time he could hear the creatures splashing in the\r\npools not a dozen feet behind him, and once he slipped and almost fell.\r\n\r\nThey chased him to the very foot of the cliffs, and desisted only when\r\nhe had been joined by the workmen at the foot of the ladder-way up the\r\ncliff. All three of the men pelted them with stones for a time, and\r\nthen hurried to the cliff top and along the path towards Sidmouth, to\r\nsecure assistance and a boat, and to rescue the desecrated body from\r\nthe clutches of these abominable creatures.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nAnd, as if he had not already been in sufficient peril that day, Mr.\r\nFison went with the boat to point out the exact spot of his adventure.\r\n\r\nAs the tide was down, it required a considerable detour to reach the\r\nspot, and when at last they came off the ladder-way, the mangled body\r\nhad disappeared. The water was now running in, submerging first one\r\nslab of slimy rock and then another, and the four men in the boat--the\r\nworkmen, that is, the boatman, and Mr. Fison--now turned their\r\nattention from the bearings off shore to the water beneath the keel.\r\n\r\nAt first they could see little below them, save a dark jungle of\r\nlaminaria, with an occasional darting fish. Their minds were set\r\non adventure, and they expressed their disappointment freely. But\r\npresently they saw one of the monsters swimming through the water\r\nseaward, with a curious rolling motion that suggested to Mr. Fison\r\nthe spinning roll of a captive balloon. Almost immediately after,\r\nthe waving streamers of laminaria were extraordinarily perturbed,\r\nparted for a moment, and three of these beasts became darkly visible,\r\nstruggling for what was probably some fragment of the drowned man. In\r\na moment the copious olive-green ribbons had poured again over this\r\nwrithing group.\r\n\r\nAt that all four men, greatly excited, began beating the water with\r\noars and shouting, and immediately they saw a tumultuous movement among\r\nthe weeds. They desisted to see more clearly, and as soon as the water\r\nwas smooth, they saw, as it seemed to them, the whole sea bottom among\r\nthe weeds set with eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Ugly swine!\" cried one of the men. \"Why, there's dozens!\"\r\n\r\nAnd forthwith the things began to rise through the water about them.\r\nMr. Fison has since described to the writer this startling eruption\r\nout of the waving laminaria meadows. To him it seemed to occupy a\r\nconsiderable time, but it is probable that really it was an affair of\r\na few seconds only. For a time nothing but eyes, and then he speaks of\r\ntentacles streaming out and parting the weed fronds this way and that.\r\nThen these things, growing larger, until at last the bottom was hidden\r\nby their intercoiling forms, and the tips of tentacles rose darkly here\r\nand there into the air above the swell of the waters.\r\n\r\nOne came up boldly to the side of the boat, and, clinging to this with\r\nthree of its sucker-set tentacles, threw four others over the gunwale,\r\nas if with an intention either of oversetting the boat or of clambering\r\ninto it. Mr. Fison at once caught up the boathook, and, jabbing\r\nfuriously at the soft tentacles, forced it to desist. He was struck in\r\nthe back and almost pitched overboard by the boatman, who was using his\r\noar to resist a similar attack on the other side of the boat. But the\r\ntentacles on either side at once relaxed their hold at this, slid out\r\nof sight, and splashed into the water.\r\n\r\n\"We'd better get out of this,\" said Mr. Fison, who was trembling\r\nviolently. He went to the tiller, while the boatman and one of the\r\nworkmen seated themselves and began rowing. The other workman stood\r\nup in the fore part of the boat, with the boathook, ready to strike\r\nany more tentacles that might appear. Nothing else seems to have been\r\nsaid. Mr. Fison had expressed the common feeling beyond amendment.\r\nIn a hushed, scared mood, with faces white and drawn, they set about\r\nescaping from the position into which they had so recklessly blundered.\r\n\r\nBut the oars had scarcely dropped into the water before dark, tapering,\r\nserpentine ropes had bound them, and were about the rudder; and\r\ncreeping up the sides of the boat with a looping motion came the\r\nsuckers again. The men gripped their oars and pulled, but it was like\r\ntrying to move a boat in a floating raft of weeds. \"Help here!\" cried\r\nthe boatman, and Mr. Fison and the second workman rushed to help lug at\r\nthe oar.\r\n\r\nThen the man with the boathook--his name was Ewan, or Ewen--sprang up\r\nwith a curse, and began striking downward over the side, as far as he\r\ncould reach, at the bank of tentacles that now clustered along the\r\nboat's bottom. And, at the same time, the two rowers stood up to get\r\na better purchase for the recovery of their oars. The boatman handed\r\nhis to Mr. Fison, who lugged desperately, and, meanwhile, the boatman\r\nopened a big clasp-knife, and, leaning over the side of the boat, began\r\nhacking at the spiring arms upon the oar shaft.\r\n\r\nMr. Fison, staggering with the quivering rocking of the boat, his teeth\r\nset, his breath coming short, and the veins starting on his hands as\r\nhe pulled at his oar, suddenly cast his eyes seaward. And there, not\r\nfifty yards off, across the long rollers of the incoming tide, was a\r\nlarge boat standing in towards them, with three women and a little\r\nchild in it. A boatman was rowing, and a little man in a pink-ribboned\r\nstraw hat and whites stood in the stern, hailing them. For a moment, of\r\ncourse, Mr. Fison thought of help, and then he thought of the child.\r\nHe abandoned his oar forthwith, threw up his arms in a frantic gesture,\r\nand screamed to the party in the boat to keep away \"for God's sake!\"\r\nIt says much for the modesty and courage of Mr. Fison that he does not\r\nseem to be aware that there was any quality of heroism in his action at\r\nthis juncture. The oar he had abandoned was at once drawn under, and\r\npresently reappeared floating about twenty yards away.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment Mr. Fison felt the boat under him lurch violently,\r\nand a hoarse scream, a prolonged cry of terror from Hill, the boatman,\r\ncaused him to forget the party of excursionists altogether. He turned,\r\nand saw Hill crouching by the forward rowlock, his face convulsed with\r\nterror, and his right arm over the side and drawn tightly down. He gave\r\nnow a succession of short, sharp cries, \"Oh! oh! oh!--oh!\" Mr. Fison\r\nbelieves that he must have been hacking at the tentacles below the\r\nwater-line, and have been grasped by them, but, of course, it is quite\r\nimpossible to say now certainly what had happened. The boat was heeling\r\nover, so that the gunwale was within ten inches of the water, and both\r\nEwan and the other labourer were striking down into the water, with oar\r\nand boathook, on either side of Hill's arm. Mr. Fison instinctively\r\nplaced himself to counterpoise them.\r\n\r\nThen Hill, who was a burly, powerful man, made a strenuous effort, and\r\nrose almost to a standing position. He lifted his arm, indeed, clean\r\nout of the water. Hanging to it was a complicated tangle of brown\r\nropes; and the eyes of one of the brutes that had hold of him, glaring\r\nstraight and resolute, showed momentarily above the surface. The boat\r\nheeled more and more, and the green-brown water came pouring in a\r\ncascade over the side. Then Hill slipped and fell with his ribs across\r\nthe side, and his arm and the mass of tentacles about it splashed back\r\ninto the water. He rolled over; his boot kicked Mr. Fison's knee as\r\nthat gentleman rushed forward to seize him, and in another moment fresh\r\ntentacles had whipped about his waist and neck, and after a brief,\r\nconvulsive struggle, in which the boat was nearly capsized, Hill was\r\nlugged overboard. The boat righted with a violent jerk that all but\r\nsent Mr. Fison over the other side, and hid the struggle in the water\r\nfrom his eyes.\r\n\r\nHe stood staggering to recover his balance for a moment, and as he\r\ndid so, he became aware that the struggle and the inflowing tide had\r\ncarried them close upon the weedy rocks again. Not four yards off a\r\ntable of rock still rose in rhythmic movements above the in-wash of the\r\ntide. In a moment Mr. Fison seized the oar from Ewan, gave one vigorous\r\nstroke, then, dropping it, ran to the bows and leapt. He felt his feet\r\nslide over the rock, and, by a frantic effort, leapt again towards a\r\nfurther mass. He stumbled over this, came to his knees, and rose again.\r\n\r\n\"Look out!\" cried someone, and a large drab body struck him. He was\r\nknocked flat into a tidal pool by one of the workmen, and as he went\r\ndown he heard smothered, choking cries, that he believed at the time\r\ncame from Hill. Then he found himself marvelling at the shrillness and\r\nvariety of Hill's voice. Someone jumped over him, and a curving rush\r\nof foamy water poured over him, and passed. He scrambled to his feet\r\ndripping, and, without looking seaward, ran as fast as his terror would\r\nlet him shoreward. Before him, over the flat space of scattered rocks,\r\nstumbled the two workmen--one a dozen yards in front of the other.\r\n\r\nHe looked over his shoulder at last, and, seeing that he was not\r\npursued, faced about. He was astonished. From the moment of the rising\r\nof the cephalopods out of the water, he had been acting too swiftly\r\nto fully comprehend his actions. Now it seemed to him as if he had\r\nsuddenly jumped out of an evil dream.\r\n\r\nFor there were the sky, cloudless and blazing with the afternoon sun,\r\nthe sea weltering under its pitiless brightness, the soft creamy foam\r\nof the breaking water, and the low, long, dark ridges of rock. The\r\nrighted boat floated, rising and falling gently on the swell about\r\na dozen yards from shore. Hill and the monsters, all the stress and\r\ntumult of that fierce fight for life, had vanished as though they had\r\nnever been.\r\n\r\nMr. Fison's heart was beating violently; he was throbbing to the\r\nfinger-tips, and his breath came deep.\r\n\r\nThere was something missing. For some seconds he could not think\r\nclearly enough what this might be. Sun, sky, sea, rocks--what was it?\r\nThen he remembered the boatload of excursionists. It had vanished.\r\nHe wondered whether he had imagined it. He turned, and saw the two\r\nworkmen standing side by side under the projecting masses of the tall\r\npink cliffs. He hesitated whether he should make one last attempt\r\nto save the man Hill. His physical excitement seemed to desert him\r\nsuddenly, and leave him aimless and helpless. He turned shoreward,\r\nstumbling and wading towards his two companions.\r\n\r\nHe looked back again, and there were now two boats floating, and the\r\none farthest out at sea pitched clumsily, bottom upward.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nSo it was _Haploteuthis ferox_ made its appearance upon the Devonshire\r\ncoast. So far, this has been its most serious aggression. Mr. Fison's\r\naccount, taken together with the wave of boating and bathing casualties\r\nto which I have already alluded, and the absence of fish from the\r\nCornish coasts that year, points clearly to a shoal of these voracious\r\ndeep-sea monsters prowling slowly along the sub-tidal coastline.\r\nHunger migration has, I know, been suggested as the force that drove\r\nthem hither; but, for my own part, I prefer to believe the alternative\r\ntheory of Hemsley. Hemsley holds that a pack or shoal of these\r\ncreatures may have become enamoured of human flesh by the accident of\r\na foundered ship sinking among them, and have wandered in search of it\r\nout of their accustomed zone; first waylaying and following ships, and\r\nso coming to our shores in the wake of the Atlantic traffic. But to\r\ndiscuss Hemsley's cogent and admirably-stated arguments would be out\r\nof place here.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that the appetites of the shoal were satisfied by the\r\ncatch of eleven people--for so far as can be ascertained, there were\r\nten people in the second boat, and certainly these creatures gave\r\nno further signs of their presence off Sidmouth that day. The coast\r\nbetween Seaton and Budleigh Salterton was patrolled all that evening\r\nand night by four Preventive Service boats, the men in which were armed\r\nwith harpoons and cutlasses, and as the evening advanced, a number\r\nof more or less similarly equipped expeditions, organised by private\r\nindividuals, joined them. Mr. Fison took no part in any of these\r\nexpeditions.\r\n\r\nAbout midnight excited hails were heard from a boat about a couple of\r\nmiles out at sea to the south-east of Sidmouth, and a lantern was seen\r\nwaving in a strange manner to and fro and up and down. The nearer boats\r\nat once hurried towards the alarm. The venturesome occupants of the\r\nboat, a seaman, a curate, and two schoolboys, had actually seen the\r\nmonsters passing under their boat. The creatures, it seems, like most\r\ndeep-sea organisms, were phosphorescent, and they had been floating,\r\nfive fathoms deep or so, like creatures of moonshine through the\r\nblackness of the water, their tentacles retracted and as if asleep,\r\nrolling over and over, and moving slowly in a wedge-like formation\r\ntowards the south-east.\r\n\r\nThese people told their story in gesticulated fragments, as first one\r\nboat drew alongside and then another. At last there was a little fleet\r\nof eight or nine boats collected together, and from them a tumult,\r\nlike the chatter of a marketplace, rose into the stillness of the\r\nnight. There was little or no disposition to pursue the shoal, the\r\npeople had neither weapons nor experience for such a dubious chase,\r\nand presently--even with a certain relief, it may be--the boats turned\r\nshoreward.\r\n\r\nAnd now to tell what is perhaps the most astonishing fact in this whole\r\nastonishing raid. We have not the slightest knowledge of the subsequent\r\nmovements of the shoal, although the whole south-west coast was now\r\nalert for it. But it may, perhaps, be significant that a cachalot\r\nwas stranded off Sark on June 3. Two weeks and three days after this\r\nSidmouth affair, a living _Haploteuthis_ came ashore on Calais sands.\r\nIt was alive, because several witnesses saw its tentacles moving in a\r\nconvulsive way. But it is probable that it was dying. A gentleman named\r\nPouchet obtained a rifle and shot it.\r\n\r\nThat was the last appearance of a living _Haploteuthis_. No others\r\nwere seen on the French coast. On the 15th of June a dead body, almost\r\ncomplete, was washed ashore near Torquay, and a few days later a boat\r\nfrom the Marine Biological station, engaged in dredging off Plymouth,\r\npicked up a rotting specimen, slashed deeply with a cutlass wound. How\r\nthe former specimen had come by its death it is impossible to say. And\r\non the last day of June, Mr. Egbert Caine, an artist, bathing near\r\nNewlyn, threw up his arms, shrieked, and was drawn under. A friend\r\nbathing with him made no attempt to save him, but swam at once for\r\nthe shore. This is the last fact to tell of this extraordinary raid\r\nfrom the deeper sea. Whether it is really the last of these horrible\r\ncreatures it is, as yet, premature to say. But it is believed, and\r\ncertainly it is to be hoped, that they have returned now, and returned\r\nfor good, to the sunless depths of the middle seas, out of which they\r\nhave so strangely and so mysteriously arisen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLLOCK AND THE PORROH MAN\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was in a swampy village on the lagoon river behind the Turner\r\nPeninsula that Pollock's first encounter with the Porroh man occurred.\r\nThe women of that country are famous for their good looks--they are\r\nGallinas with a dash of European blood that dates from the days of\r\nVasco de Gama and the English slave-traders, and the Porroh man, too,\r\nwas possibly inspired by a faint Caucasian taint in his composition.\r\n(It's a curious thing to think that some of us may have distant cousins\r\neating men on Sherboro Island or raiding with the Sofas.) At anyrate,\r\nthe Porroh man stabbed the woman to the heart as though he had been a\r\nmere low-class Italian, and very narrowly missed Pollock. But Pollock,\r\nusing his revolver to parry the lightning stab which was aimed at his\r\ndeltoid muscle, sent the iron dagger flying, and, firing, hit the man\r\nin the hand.\r\n\r\nHe fired again and missed, knocking a sudden window out of the wall\r\nof the hut. The Porroh man stooped in the doorway, glancing under his\r\narm at Pollock. Pollock caught a glimpse of his inverted face in the\r\nsunlight, and then the Englishman was alone, sick and trembling with\r\nthe excitement of the affair, in the twilight of the place. It had all\r\nhappened in less time than it takes to read about it.\r\n\r\nThe woman was quite dead, and having ascertained this, Pollock went to\r\nthe entrance of the hut and looked out. Things outside were dazzling\r\nbright. Half a dozen of the porters of the expedition were standing up\r\nin a group near the green huts they occupied, and staring towards him,\r\nwondering what the shots might signify. Behind the little group of men\r\nwas the broad stretch of black fetid mud by the river, a green carpet\r\nof rafts of papyrus and water-grass, and then the leaden water. The\r\nmangroves beyond the stream loomed indistinctly through the blue haze.\r\nThere were no signs of excitement in the squat village, whose fence was\r\njust visible above the cane-grass.\r\n\r\nPollock came out of the hut cautiously and walked towards the river,\r\nlooking over his shoulder at intervals. But the Porroh man had\r\nvanished. Pollock clutched his revolver nervously in his hand.\r\n\r\nOne of his men came to meet him, and as he came, pointed to the bushes\r\nbehind the hut in which the Porroh man had disappeared. Pollock had\r\nan irritating persuasion of having made an absolute fool of himself;\r\nhe felt bitter, savage, at the turn things had taken. At the same\r\ntime, he would have to tell Waterhouse--the moral, exemplary, cautious\r\nWaterhouse--who would inevitably take the matter seriously. Pollock\r\ncursed bitterly at his luck, at Waterhouse, and especially at the West\r\nCoast of Africa. He felt consummately sick of the expedition. And\r\nin the back of his mind all the time was a speculative doubt where\r\nprecisely within the visible horizon the Porroh man might be.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps rather shocking, but he was not at all upset by the\r\nmurder that had just happened. He had seen so much brutality during the\r\nlast three months, so many dead women, burnt huts, drying skeletons, up\r\nthe Kittam River in the wake of the Sofa cavalry, that his senses were\r\nblunted. What disturbed him was the persuasion that this business was\r\nonly beginning.\r\n\r\nHe swore savagely at the black, who ventured to ask a question, and\r\nwent on into the tent under the orange-trees where Waterhouse was\r\nlying, feeling exasperatingly like a boy going into the headmaster's\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\nWaterhouse was still sleeping off the effects of his last dose of\r\nchlorodyne, and Pollock sat down on a packing-case beside him, and,\r\nlighting his pipe, waited for him to awake. About him were scattered\r\nthe pots and weapons Waterhouse had collected from the Mendi people,\r\nand which he had been repacking for the canoe voyage to Sulyma.\r\n\r\nPresently Waterhouse woke up, and after judicial stretching, decided\r\nhe was all right again. Pollock got him some tea. Over the tea the\r\nincidents of the afternoon were described by Pollock, after some\r\npreliminary beating about the bush. Waterhouse took the matter even\r\nmore seriously than Pollock had anticipated. He did not simply\r\ndisapprove, he scolded, he insulted.\r\n\r\n\"You're one of those infernal fools who think a black man isn't a human\r\nbeing,\" he said. \"I can't be ill a day without you must get into some\r\ndirty scrape or other. This is the third time in a month that you have\r\ncome crossways-on with a native, and this time you're in for it with a\r\nvengeance. Porroh, too! They're down upon you enough as it is, about\r\nthat idol you wrote your silly name on. And they're the most vindictive\r\ndevils on earth! You make a man ashamed of civilisation. To think you\r\ncome of a decent family! If ever I cumber myself up with a vicious,\r\nstupid young lout like you again\"--\r\n\r\n\"Steady on, now,\" snarled Pollock, in the tone that always exasperated\r\nWaterhouse; \"steady on.\"\r\n\r\nAt that Waterhouse became speechless. He jumped to his feet.\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Pollock,\" he said, after a struggle to control his breath.\r\n\"You must go home. I won't have you any longer. I'm ill enough as it is\r\nthrough you\"--\r\n\r\n\"Keep your hair on,\" said Pollock, staring in front of him. \"I'm ready\r\nenough to go.\"\r\n\r\nWaterhouse became calmer again. He sat down on the camp-stool. \"Very\r\nwell,\" he said. \"I don't want a row, Pollock, you know, but it's\r\nconfoundedly annoying to have one's plans put out by this kind of\r\nthing. I'll come to Sulyma with you, and see you safe aboard\"--\r\n\r\n\"You needn't,\" said Pollock. \"I can go alone. From here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not far,\" said Waterhouse. \"You don't understand this Porroh\r\nbusiness.\"\r\n\r\n\"How should _I_ know she belonged to a Porroh man?\" said Pollock\r\nbitterly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, she did,\" said Waterhouse; \"and you can't undo the thing. Go\r\nalone, indeed! I wonder what they'd do to you. You don't seem to\r\nunderstand that this Porroh hokey-pokey rules this country, is its law,\r\nreligion, constitution, medicine, magic.... They appoint the chiefs.\r\nThe Inquisition, at its best, couldn't hold a candle to these chaps.\r\nHe will probably set Awajale, the chief here, on to us. It's lucky our\r\nporters are Mendis. We shall have to shift this little settlement of\r\nours.... Confound you, Pollock! And, of course, you must go and miss\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nHe thought, and his thoughts seemed disagreeable. Presently he stood up\r\nand took his rifle. \"I'd keep close for a bit, if I were you,\" he said,\r\nover his shoulder, as he went out. \"I'm going out to see what I can\r\nfind out about it.\"\r\n\r\nPollock remained sitting in the tent, meditating. \"I was meant for a\r\ncivilised life,\" he said to himself, regretfully, as he filled his\r\npipe. \"The sooner I get back to London or Paris the better for me.\"\r\n\r\nHis eye fell on the sealed case in which Waterhouse had put the\r\nfeatherless poisoned arrows they had bought in the Mendi country. \"I\r\nwish I had hit the beggar somewhere vital,\" said Pollock viciously.\r\n\r\nWaterhouse came back after a long interval. He was not communicative,\r\nthough Pollock asked him questions enough. The Porroh man, it seems,\r\nwas a prominent member of that mystical society. The village was\r\ninterested, but not threatening. No doubt the witch-doctor had gone\r\ninto the bush. He was a great witch-doctor. \"Of course, he's up to\r\nsomething,\" said Waterhouse, and became silent.\r\n\r\n\"But what can he do?\" asked Pollock, unheeded.\r\n\r\n\"I must get you out of this. There's something brewing, or things would\r\nnot be so quiet,\" said Waterhouse, after a gap of silence. Pollock\r\nwanted to know what the brew might be. \"Dancing in a circle of skulls,\"\r\nsaid Waterhouse; \"brewing a stink in a copper pot.\" Pollock wanted\r\nparticulars. Waterhouse was vague, Pollock pressing. At last Waterhouse\r\nlost his temper. \"How the devil should _I_ know?\" he said to Pollock's\r\ntwentieth inquiry what the Porroh man would do. \"He tried to kill\r\nyou off-hand in the hut. _Now_, I fancy he will try something more\r\nelaborate. But you'll see fast enough. I don't want to help unnerve\r\nyou. It's probably all nonsense.\"\r\n\r\nThat night, as they were sitting at their fire, Pollock again tried to\r\ndraw Waterhouse out on the subject of Porroh methods. \"Better get to\r\nsleep,\" said Waterhouse, when Pollock's bent became apparent; \"we start\r\nearly to-morrow. You may want all your nerve about you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what line will he take?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't say. They're versatile people. They know a lot of rum dodges.\r\nYou'd better get that copper-devil, Shakespear, to talk.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a flash and a heavy bang out of the darkness behind the\r\nhuts, and a clay bullet came whistling close to Pollock's head. This,\r\nat least, was crude enough. The blacks and half-breeds sitting and\r\nyarning round their own fire jumped up, and someone fired into the dark.\r\n\r\n\"Better go into one of the huts,\" said Waterhouse quietly, still\r\nsitting unmoved.\r\n\r\nPollock stood up by the fire and drew his revolver. Fighting, at least,\r\nhe was not afraid of. But a man in the dark is in the best of armour.\r\nRealising the wisdom of Waterhouse's advice, Pollock went into the tent\r\nand lay down there.\r\n\r\nWhat little sleep he had was disturbed by dreams, variegated dreams,\r\nbut chiefly of the Porroh man's face, upside down, as he went out of\r\nthe hut, and looked up under his arm. It was odd that this transitory\r\nimpression should have stuck so firmly in Pollock's memory. Moreover,\r\nhe was troubled by queer pains in his limbs.\r\n\r\nIn the white haze of the early morning, as they were loading the\r\ncanoes, a barbed arrow suddenly appeared quivering in the ground close\r\nto Pollock's foot. The boys made a perfunctory effort to clear out the\r\nthicket, but it led to no capture.\r\n\r\nAfter these two occurrences, there was a disposition on the part of\r\nthe expedition to leave Pollock to himself, and Pollock became, for\r\nthe first time in his life, anxious to mingle with blacks. Waterhouse\r\ntook one canoe, and Pollock, in spite of a friendly desire to chat\r\nwith Waterhouse, had to take the other. He was left all alone in the\r\nfront part of the canoe, and he had the greatest trouble to make the\r\nmen--who did not love him--keep to the middle of the river, a clear\r\nhundred yards or more from either shore. However, he made Shakespear,\r\nthe Freetown half-breed, come up to his own end of the canoe and tell\r\nhim about Porroh, which Shakespear, failing in his attempts to leave\r\nPollock alone, presently did with considerable freedom and gusto.\r\n\r\nThe day passed. The canoe glided swiftly along the ribbon of lagoon\r\nwater, between the drift of water-figs, fallen trees, papyrus, and\r\npalm-wine palms, and with the dark mangrove swamp to the left, through\r\nwhich one could hear now and then the roar of the Atlantic surf.\r\nShakespear told in his soft, blurred English of how the Porroh could\r\ncast spells; how men withered up under their malice; how they could\r\nsend dreams and devils; how they tormented and killed the sons of\r\nIjibu; how they kidnapped a white trader from Sulyma who had maltreated\r\none of the sect, and how his body looked when it was found. And Pollock\r\nafter each narrative cursed under his breath at the want of missionary\r\nenterprise that allowed such things to be, and at the inert British\r\nGovernment that ruled over this dark heathendom of Sierra Leone. In\r\nthe evening they came to the Kasi Lake, and sent a score of crocodiles\r\nlumbering off the island on which the expedition camped for the night.\r\n\r\nThe next day they reached Sulyma, and smelt the sea breeze, but Pollock\r\nhad to put up there for five days before he could get on to Freetown.\r\nWaterhouse, considering him to be comparatively safe here, and within\r\nthe pale of Freetown influence, left him and went back with the\r\nexpedition to Gbemma, and Pollock became very friendly with Perera,\r\nthe only resident white trader at Sulyma--so friendly, indeed, that he\r\nwent about with him everywhere. Perera was a little Portuguese Jew, who\r\nhad lived in England, and he appreciated the Englishman's friendliness\r\nas a great compliment.\r\n\r\nFor two days nothing happened out of the ordinary; for the most part\r\nPollock and Perera played Nap--the only game they had in common--and\r\nPollock got into debt. Then, on the second evening, Pollock had a\r\ndisagreeable intimation of the arrival of the Porroh man in Sulyma by\r\ngetting a flesh-wound in the shoulder from a lump of filed iron. It\r\nwas a long shot, and the missile had nearly spent its force when it\r\nhit him. Still it conveyed its message plainly enough. Pollock sat up\r\nin his hammock, revolver in hand, all that night, and next morning\r\nconfided, to some extent, in the Anglo-Portuguese.\r\n\r\nPerera took the matter seriously. He knew the local customs pretty\r\nthoroughly. \"It is a personal question, you must know. It is revenge.\r\nAnd of course he is hurried by your leaving de country. None of de\r\nnatives or half-breeds will interfere wid him very much--unless you\r\nmake it wort deir while. If you come upon him suddenly, you might shoot\r\nhim. But den he might shoot you.\r\n\r\n\"Den dere's dis--infernal magic,\" said Perera. \"Of course, I don't\r\nbelieve in it--superstition--but still it's not nice to tink dat\r\nwherever you are, dere is a black man, who spends a moonlight night now\r\nand den a-dancing about a fire to send you bad dreams.... Had any bad\r\ndreams?\"\r\n\r\n\"Rather,\" said Pollock. \"I keep on seeing the beggar's head upside down\r\ngrinning at me and showing all his teeth as he did in the hut, and\r\ncoming close up to me, and then going ever so far off, and coming back.\r\nIt's nothing to be afraid of, but somehow it simply paralyses me with\r\nterror in my sleep. Queer things--dreams. I know it's a dream all the\r\ntime, and I can't wake up from it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's probably only fancy,\" said Perera. \"Den my niggers say Porroh men\r\ncan send snakes. Seen any snakes lately?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only one. I killed him this morning, on the floor near my hammock.\r\nAlmost trod on him as I got up.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Ah!_\" said Perera, and then, reassuringly, \"Of course it is\r\na--coincidence. Still I would keep my eyes open. Den dere's pains in de\r\nbones.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought they were due to miasma,\" said Pollock.\r\n\r\n\"Probably dey are. When did dey begin?\"\r\n\r\nThen Pollock remembered that he first noticed them the night after the\r\nfight in the hut. \"It's my opinion he don't want to kill you,\" said\r\nPerera--\"at least not yet. I've heard deir idea is to scare and worry\r\na man wid deir spells, and narrow misses, and rheumatic pains, and bad\r\ndreams, and all dat, until he's sick of life. Of course, it's all talk,\r\nyou know. You mustn't worry about it.... But I wonder what he'll be up\r\nto next.\"\r\n\r\n\"_I_ shall have to be up to something first,\" said Pollock, staring\r\ngloomily at the greasy cards that Perera was putting on the table. \"It\r\ndon't suit my dignity to be followed about, and shot at, and blighted\r\nin this way. I wonder if Porroh hokey-pokey upsets your luck at cards.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at Perera suspiciously.\r\n\r\n\"Very likely it does,\" said Perera warmly, shuffling. \"Dey are\r\nwonderful people.\"\r\n\r\nThat afternoon Pollock killed two snakes in his hammock, and there\r\nwas also an extraordinary increase in the number of red ants that\r\nswarmed over the place; and these annoyances put him in a fit temper\r\nto talk over business with a certain Mendi rough he had interviewed\r\nbefore. The Mendi rough showed Pollock a little iron dagger, and\r\ndemonstrated where one struck in the neck, in a way that made Pollock\r\nshiver, and in return for certain considerations Pollock promised him a\r\ndouble-barrelled gun with an ornamental lock.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, as Pollock and Perera were playing cards, the Mendi\r\nrough came in through the doorway, carrying something in a blood-soaked\r\npiece of native cloth.\r\n\r\n\"Not here!\" said Pollock very hurriedly. \"Not here!\"\r\n\r\nBut he was not quick enough to prevent the man, who was anxious to get\r\nto Pollock's side of the bargain, from opening the cloth and throwing\r\nthe head of the Porroh man upon the table. It bounded from there on to\r\nthe floor, leaving a red trail on the cards, and rolled into a corner,\r\nwhere it came to rest upside down, but glaring hard at Pollock.\r\n\r\nPerera jumped up as the thing fell among the cards, and began in his\r\nexcitement to gabble in Portuguese. The Mendi was bowing, with the red\r\ncloth in his hand. \"De gun!\" he said. Pollock stared back at the head\r\nin the corner. It bore exactly the expression it had in his dreams.\r\nSomething seemed to snap in his own brain as he looked at it.\r\n\r\nThen Perera found his English again.\r\n\r\n\"You got him killed?\" he said. \"You did not kill him yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should I?\" said Pollock.\r\n\r\n\"But he will not be able to take it off now!\"\r\n\r\n\"Take _what_ off?\" said Pollock.\r\n\r\n\"And all dese cards are spoiled!\"\r\n\r\n\"_What_ do you mean by taking off?\" said Pollock.\r\n\r\n\"You must send me a new pack from Freetown. You can buy dem dere.\"\r\n\r\n\"But--'take it off'?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is only superstition. I forgot. De niggers say dat if de\r\nwitches--he was a witch-- But it is rubbish.... You must make de Porroh\r\nman take it off, or kill him yourself.... It is very silly.\"\r\n\r\nPollock swore under his breath, still staring hard at the head in the\r\ncorner.\r\n\r\n\"I can't stand that glare,\" he said. Then suddenly he rushed at the\r\nthing and kicked it. It rolled some yards or so, and came to rest in\r\nthe same position as before, upside down, and looking at him.\r\n\r\n\"He is ugly,\" said the Anglo-Portuguese. \"Very ugly. Dey do it on deir\r\nfaces with little knives.\"\r\n\r\nPollock would have kicked the head again, but the Mendi man touched\r\nhim on the arm. \"De gun?\" he said, looking nervously at the head.\r\n\r\n\"Two--if you will take that beastly thing away,\" said Pollock.\r\n\r\nThe Mendi shook his head, and intimated that he only wanted one gun now\r\ndue to him, and for which he would be obliged. Pollock found neither\r\ncajolery nor bullying any good with him. Perera had a gun to sell (at\r\na profit of three hundred per cent.), and with that the man presently\r\ndeparted. Then Pollock's eyes, against his will, were recalled to the\r\nthing on the floor.\r\n\r\n\"It is funny dat his head keeps upside down,\" said Perera, with an\r\nuneasy laugh. \"His brains must be heavy, like de weight in de little\r\nimages one sees dat keep always upright wid lead in dem. You will take\r\nhim wiv you when you go presently. You might take him now. De cards are\r\nall spoilt. Dere is a man sell dem in Freetown. De room is in a filty\r\nmess as it is. You should have killed him yourself.\"\r\n\r\nPollock pulled himself together, and went and picked up the head. He\r\nwould hang it up by the lamp-hook in the middle of the ceiling of his\r\nroom, and dig a grave for it at once. He was under the impression that\r\nhe hung it up by the hair, but that must have been wrong, for when he\r\nreturned for it, it was hanging by the neck upside down.\r\n\r\nHe buried it before sunset on the north side of the shed he occupied,\r\nso that he should not have to pass the grave after dark when he was\r\nreturning from Perera's. He killed two snakes before he went to\r\nsleep. In the darkest part of the night he awoke with a start, and\r\nheard a pattering sound and something scraping on the floor. He sat up\r\nnoiselessly, and felt under his pillow for his revolver. A mumbling\r\ngrowl followed, and Pollock fired at the sound. There was a yelp, and\r\nsomething dark passed for a moment across the hazy blue of the doorway.\r\n\"A dog!\" said Pollock, lying down again.\r\n\r\nIn the early dawn he awoke again with a peculiar sense of unrest. The\r\nvague pain in his bones had returned. For some time he lay watching the\r\nred ants that were swarming over the ceiling, and then, as the light\r\ngrew brighter, he looked over the edge of his hammock and saw something\r\ndark on the floor. He gave such a violent start that the hammock\r\noverset and flung him out.\r\n\r\nHe found himself lying, perhaps, a yard away from the head of the\r\nPorroh man. It had been disinterred by the dog, and the nose was\r\ngrievously battered. Ants and flies swarmed over it. By an odd\r\ncoincidence, it was still upside down, and with the same diabolical\r\nexpression in the inverted eyes.\r\n\r\nPollock sat paralysed, and stared at the horror for some time. Then\r\nhe got up and walked round it--giving it a wide berth--and out of the\r\nshed. The clear light of the sunrise, the living stir of vegetation\r\nbefore the breath of the dying land-breeze, and the empty grave with\r\nthe marks of the dog's paws, lightened the weight upon his mind a\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\nHe told Perera of the business as though it was a jest--a jest to be\r\ntold with white lips. \"You should not have frighten de dog,\" said\r\nPerera, with poorly simulated hilarity.\r\n\r\nThe next two days, until the steamer came, were spent by Pollock in\r\nmaking a more effectual disposition of his possession. Overcoming\r\nhis aversion to handling the thing, he went down to the river mouth\r\nand threw it into the sea-water, but by some miracle it escaped the\r\ncrocodiles, and was cast up by the tide on the mud a little way up\r\nthe river, to be found by an intelligent Arab half-breed, and offered\r\nfor sale to Pollock and Perera as a curiosity, just on the edge of\r\nnight. The native hung about in the brief twilight, making lower and\r\nlower offers, and at last, getting scared in some way by the evident\r\ndread these wise white men had for the thing, went off, and, passing\r\nPollock's shed, threw his burden in there for Pollock to discover in\r\nthe morning.\r\n\r\nAt this Pollock got into a kind of frenzy. He would burn the thing. He\r\nwent out straightway into the dawn, and had constructed a big pyre of\r\nbrushwood before the heat of the day. He was interrupted by the hooter\r\nof the little paddle steamer from Monrovia to Bathurst, which was\r\ncoming through the gap in the bar. \"Thank Heaven!\" said Pollock, with\r\ninfinite piety, when the meaning of the sound dawned upon him. With\r\ntrembling hands he lit his pile of wood hastily, threw the head upon\r\nit, and went away to pack his portmanteau and make his adieux to Perera.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon, with a sense of infinite relief, Pollock watched the\r\nflat swampy foreshore of Sulyma grow small in the distance. The gap in\r\nthe long line of white surge became narrower and narrower. It seemed\r\nto be closing in and cutting him off from his trouble. The feeling of\r\ndread and worry began to slip from him bit by bit. At Sulyma belief in\r\nPorroh malignity and Porroh magic had been in the air, his sense of\r\nPorroh had been vast, pervading, threatening, dreadful. Now manifestly\r\nthe domain of Porroh was only a little place, a little black band\r\nbetween the sea and the blue cloudy Mendi uplands.\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye, Porroh!\" said Pollock. \"Good-bye--certainly not _au revoir_.\"\r\n\r\nThe captain of the steamer came and leant over the rail beside him, and\r\nwished him good-evening, and spat at the froth of the wake in token of\r\nfriendly ease.\r\n\r\n\"I picked up a rummy curio on the beach this go,\" said the captain.\r\n\"It's a thing I never saw done this side of Indy before.\"\r\n\r\n\"What might that be?\" said Pollock.\r\n\r\n\"Pickled 'ed,\" said the captain.\r\n\r\n\"_What?_\" said Pollock.\r\n\r\n\"'Ed--smoked. 'Ed of one of these Porroh chaps, all ornamented with\r\nknife-cuts. Why! What's up? Nothing? I shouldn't have took you for a\r\nnervous chap. Green in the face. By gosh! you're a bad sailor. All\r\nright, eh? Lord, how funny you went!... Well, this 'ed I was telling\r\nyou of is a bit rum in a way. I've got it, along with some snakes, in a\r\njar of spirit in my cabin what I keeps for such curios, and I'm hanged\r\nif it don't float upsy down. Hullo!\"\r\n\r\nPollock had given an incoherent cry, and had his hands in his hair. He\r\nran towards the paddle-boxes with a half-formed idea of jumping into\r\nthe sea, and then he realised his position and turned back towards the\r\ncaptain.\r\n\r\n\"Here!\" said the captain. \"Jack Philips, just keep him off me! Stand\r\noff! No nearer, mister! What's the matter with you? Are you mad?\"\r\n\r\nPollock put his hand to his head. It was no good explaining. \"I believe\r\nI am pretty nearly mad at times,\" he said. \"It's a pain I have here.\r\nComes suddenly. You'll excuse me, I hope.\"\r\n\r\nHe was white and in a perspiration. He saw suddenly very clearly all\r\nthe danger he ran of having his sanity doubted. He forced himself\r\nto restore the captain's confidence, by answering his sympathetic\r\ninquiries, noting his suggestions, even trying a spoonful of neat\r\nbrandy in his cheek, and, that matter settled, asking a number of\r\nquestions about the captain's private trade in curiosities. The captain\r\ndescribed the head in detail. All the while Pollock was struggling to\r\nkeep under a preposterous persuasion that the ship was as transparent\r\nas glass, and that he could distinctly see the inverted face looking at\r\nhim from the cabin beneath his feet.\r\n\r\nPollock had a worse time almost on the steamer than he had at Sulyma.\r\nAll day he had to control himself in spite of his intense perception\r\nof the imminent presence of that horrible head that was overshadowing\r\nhis mind. At night his old nightmare returned, until, with a violent\r\neffort, he would force himself awake, rigid with the horror of it, and\r\nwith the ghost of a hoarse scream in his throat.\r\n\r\nHe left the actual head behind at Bathurst, where he changed ship\r\nfor Teneriffe, but not his dreams nor the dull ache in his bones.\r\nAt Teneriffe Pollock transferred to a Cape liner, but the head\r\nfollowed him. He gambled, he tried chess, he even read books, but\r\nhe knew the danger of drink. Yet whenever a round black shadow, a\r\nround black object came into his range, there he looked for the head,\r\nand--saw it. He knew clearly enough that his imagination was growing\r\ntraitor to him, and yet at times it seemed the ship he sailed in,\r\nhis fellow-passengers, the sailors, the wide sea, was all part of a\r\nfilmy phantasmagoria that hung, scarcely veiling it, between him and a\r\nhorrible real world. Then the Porroh man, thrusting his diabolical face\r\nthrough that curtain, was the one real and undeniable thing. At that he\r\nwould get up and touch things, taste something, gnaw something, burn\r\nhis hand with a match, or run a needle into himself.\r\n\r\nSo, struggling grimly and silently with his excited imagination,\r\nPollock reached England. He landed at Southampton, and went on straight\r\nfrom Waterloo to his banker's in Cornhill in a cab. There he transacted\r\nsome business with the manager in a private room, and all the while the\r\nhead hung like an ornament under the black marble mantel and dripped\r\nupon the fender. He could hear the drops fall, and see the red on the\r\nfender.\r\n\r\n\"A pretty fern,\" said the manager, following his eyes. \"But it makes\r\nthe fender rusty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very,\" said Pollock; \"a _very_ pretty fern. And that reminds me.\r\nCan you recommend me a physician for mind troubles? I've got a\r\nlittle--what is it?--hallucination.\"\r\n\r\nThe head laughed savagely, wildly. Pollock was surprised the manager\r\ndid not notice it. But the manager only stared at his face.\r\n\r\nWith the address of a doctor, Pollock presently emerged in Cornhill.\r\nThere was no cab in sight, and so he went on down to the western end\r\nof the street, and essayed the crossing opposite the Mansion House.\r\nThe crossing is hardly easy even for the expert Londoner; cabs, vans,\r\ncarriages, mail-carts, omnibuses go by in one incessant stream; to\r\nanyone fresh from the malarious solitudes of Sierra Leone it is a\r\nboiling, maddening confusion. But when an inverted head suddenly comes\r\nbouncing, like an indiarubber ball, between your legs, leaving distinct\r\nsmears of blood every time it touches the ground, you can scarcely hope\r\nto avoid an accident. Pollock lifted his feet convulsively to avoid\r\nit, and then kicked at the thing furiously. Then something hit him\r\nviolently in the back, and a hot pain ran up his arm.\r\n\r\nHe had been hit by the pole of an omnibus, and three of the fingers\r\nof his left hand smashed by the hoof of one of the horses--the very\r\nfingers, as it happened, that he shot from the Porroh man. They pulled\r\nhim out from between the horses' legs, and found the address of the\r\nphysician in his crushed hand.\r\n\r\nFor a couple of days Pollock's sensations were full of the sweet,\r\npungent smell of chloroform, of painful operations that caused him no\r\npain, of lying still and being given food and drink. Then he had a\r\nslight fever, and was very thirsty, and his old nightmare came back. It\r\nwas only when it returned that he noticed it had left him for a day.\r\n\r\n\"If my skull had been smashed instead of my fingers, it might have gone\r\naltogether,\" said Pollock, staring thoughtfully at the dark cushion\r\nthat had taken on for the time the shape of the head.\r\n\r\nPollock at the first opportunity told the physician of his mind\r\ntrouble. He knew clearly that he must go mad unless something\r\nshould intervene to save him. He explained that he had witnessed\r\na decapitation in Dahomey, and was haunted by one of the heads.\r\nNaturally, he did not care to state the actual facts. The physician\r\nlooked grave.\r\n\r\nPresently he spoke hesitatingly. \"As a child, did you get very much\r\nreligious training?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very little,\" said Pollock.\r\n\r\nA shade passed over the physician's face. \"I don't know if you have\r\nheard of the miraculous cures--it may be, of course, they are not\r\nmiraculous--at Lourdes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Faith-healing will hardly suit me, I am afraid,\" said Pollock, with\r\nhis eye on the dark cushion.\r\n\r\nThe head distorted its scarred features in an abominable grimace. The\r\nphysician went upon a new track. \"It's all imagination,\" he said,\r\nspeaking with sudden briskness. \"A fair case for faith-healing, anyhow.\r\nYour nervous system has run down, you're in that twilight state of\r\nhealth when the bogles come easiest. The strong impression was too\r\nmuch for you. I must make you up a little mixture that will strengthen\r\nyour nervous system--especially your brain. And you must take exercise.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm no good for faith-healing,\" said Pollock.\r\n\r\n\"And therefore we must restore tone. Go in search of stimulating\r\nair--Scotland, Norway, the Alps\"--\r\n\r\n\"Jericho, if you like,\" said Pollock--\"where Naaman went.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, so soon as his fingers would let him, Pollock made a gallant\r\nattempt to follow out the doctor's suggestion. It was now November.\r\nHe tried football, but to Pollock the game consisted in kicking a\r\nfurious inverted head about a field. He was no good at the game. He\r\nkicked blindly, with a kind of horror, and when they put him back into\r\ngoal, and the ball came swooping down upon him, he suddenly yelled\r\nand got out of its way. The discreditable stories that had driven him\r\nfrom England to wander in the tropics shut him off from any but men's\r\nsociety, and now his increasingly strange behaviour made even his man\r\nfriends avoid him. The thing was no longer a thing of the eye merely;\r\nit gibbered at him, spoke to him. A horrible fear came upon him that\r\npresently, when he took hold of the apparition, it would no longer\r\nbecome some mere article of furniture, but would _feel_ like a real\r\ndissevered head. Alone, he would curse at the thing, defy it, entreat\r\nit; once or twice, in spite of his grim self-control, he addressed it\r\nin the presence of others. He felt the growing suspicion in the eyes of\r\nthe people that watched him--his landlady, the servant, his man.\r\n\r\nOne day early in December his cousin Arnold--his next of kin--came to\r\nsee him and draw him out, and watch his sunken yellow face with narrow\r\neager eyes. And it seemed to Pollock that the hat his cousin carried\r\nin his hand was no hat at all, but a Gorgon head that glared at him\r\nupside down, and fought with its eyes against his reason. However,\r\nhe was still resolute to see the matter out. He got a bicycle, and,\r\nriding over the frosty road from Wandsworth to Kingston, found the\r\nthing rolling along at his side, and leaving a dark trail behind it. He\r\nset his teeth and rode faster. Then suddenly, as he came down the hill\r\ntowards Richmond Park, the apparition rolled in front of him and under\r\nhis wheel, so quickly that he had no time for thought, and, turning\r\nquickly to avoid it, was flung violently against a heap of stones and\r\nbroke his left wrist.\r\n\r\nThe end came on Christmas morning. All night he had been in a fever,\r\nthe bandages encircling his wrist like a band of fire, his dreams more\r\nvivid and terrible than ever. In the cold, colourless, uncertain light\r\nthat came before the sunrise, he sat up in his bed, and saw the head\r\nupon the bracket in the place of the bronze jar that had stood there\r\novernight.\r\n\r\n\"I know that is a bronze jar,\" he said, with a chill doubt at his\r\nheart. Presently the doubt was irresistible. He got out of bed slowly,\r\nshivering, and advanced to the jar with his hand raised. Surely\r\nhe would see now his imagination had deceived him, recognise the\r\ndistinctive sheen of bronze. At last, after an age of hesitation,\r\nhis fingers came down on the patterned cheek of the head. He withdrew\r\nthem spasmodically. The last stage was reached. His sense of touch had\r\nbetrayed him.\r\n\r\nTrembling, stumbling against the bed, kicking against his shoes with\r\nhis bare feet, a dark confusion eddying round him, he groped his way to\r\nthe dressing-table, took his razor from the drawer, and sat down on the\r\nbed with this in his hand. In the looking-glass he saw his own face,\r\ncolourless, haggard, full of the ultimate bitterness of despair.\r\n\r\nHe beheld in swift succession the incidents in the brief tale of his\r\nexperience. His wretched home, his still more wretched schooldays,\r\nthe years of vicious life he had led since then, one act of selfish\r\ndishonour leading to another; it was all clear and pitiless now, all\r\nits squalid folly, in the cold light of the dawn. He came to the\r\nhut, to the fight with the Porroh man, to the retreat down the river\r\nto Sulyma, to the Mendi assassin and his red parcel, to his frantic\r\nendeavours to destroy the head, to the growth of his hallucination. It\r\nwas a hallucination! He _knew_ it was. A hallucination merely. For a\r\nmoment he snatched at hope. He looked away from the glass, and on the\r\nbracket, the inverted head grinned and grimaced at him.... With the\r\nstiff fingers of his bandaged hand he felt at his neck for the throb of\r\nhis arteries. The morning was very cold, the steel blade felt like ice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RED ROOM\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I can assure you,\" said I, \"that it will take a very tangible ghost to\r\nfrighten me.\" And I stood up before the fire with my glass in my hand.\r\n\r\n\"It is your own choosing,\" said the man with the withered arm, and\r\nglanced at me askance.\r\n\r\n\"Eight-and-twenty years,\" said I, \"I have lived, and never a ghost have\r\nI seen as yet.\"\r\n\r\nThe old woman sat staring hard into the fire, her pale eyes wide open.\r\n\"Ay,\" she broke in; \"and eight-and-twenty years you have lived and\r\nnever seen the likes of this house, I reckon. There's a many things to\r\nsee, when one's still but eight-and-twenty.\" She swayed her head slowly\r\nfrom side to side. \"A many things to see and sorrow for.\"\r\n\r\nI half suspected the old people were trying to enhance the spiritual\r\nterrors of their house by their droning insistence. I put down my empty\r\nglass on the table and looked about the room, and caught a glimpse of\r\nmyself, abbreviated and broadened to an impossible sturdiness, in the\r\nqueer old mirror at the end of the room. \"Well,\" I said, \"if I see\r\nanything to-night, I shall be so much the wiser. For I come to the\r\nbusiness with an open mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's your own choosing,\" said the man with the withered arm once more.\r\n\r\nI heard the sound of a stick and a shambling step on the flags in the\r\npassage outside, and the door creaked on its hinges as a second old man\r\nentered, more bent, more wrinkled, more aged even than the first. He\r\nsupported himself by a single crutch, his eyes were covered by a shade,\r\nand his lower lip, half-averted, hung pale and pink from his decaying\r\nyellow teeth. He made straight for an arm-chair on the opposite side\r\nof the table, sat down clumsily, and began to cough. The man with the\r\nwithered arm gave this new-comer a short glance of positive dislike;\r\nthe old woman took no notice of his arrival, but remained with her eyes\r\nfixed steadily on the fire.\r\n\r\n\"I said--it's your own choosing,\" said the man with the withered arm,\r\nwhen the coughing had ceased for a while.\r\n\r\n\"It's my own choosing,\" I answered.\r\n\r\nThe man with the shade became aware of my presence for the first time,\r\nand threw his head back for a moment and sideways, to see me. I caught\r\na momentary glimpse of his eyes, small and bright and inflamed. Then he\r\nbegan to cough and splutter again.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you drink?\" said the man with the withered arm, pushing\r\nthe beer towards him. The man with the shade poured out a glassful\r\nwith a shaky arm that splashed half as much again on the deal table.\r\nA monstrous shadow of him crouched upon the wall and mocked his\r\naction as he poured and drank. I must confess I had scarce expected\r\nthese grotesque custodians. There is to my mind something inhuman in\r\nsenility, something crouching and atavistic; the human qualities seem\r\nto drop from old people insensibly day by day. The three of them made\r\nme feel uncomfortable, with their gaunt silences, their bent carriage,\r\ntheir evident unfriendliness to me and to one another.\r\n\r\n\"If,\" said I, \"you will show me to this haunted room of yours, I will\r\nmake myself comfortable there.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man with the cough jerked his head back so suddenly that it\r\nstartled me, and shot another glance of his red eyes at me from under\r\nthe shade; but no one answered me. I waited a minute, glancing from one\r\nto the other.\r\n\r\n\"If,\" I said a little louder, \"if you will show me to this haunted room\r\nof yours, I will relieve you from the task of entertaining me.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's a candle on the slab outside the door,\" said the man with the\r\nwithered arm, looking at my feet as he addressed me. \"But if you go to\r\nthe red room to-night\"--\r\n\r\n(\"This night of all nights!\" said the old woman.)\r\n\r\n\"You go alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" I answered. \"And which way do I go?\"\r\n\r\n\"You go along the passage for a bit,\" said he, \"until you come to a\r\ndoor, and through that is a spiral staircase, and half-way up that is a\r\nlanding and another door covered with baize. Go through that and down\r\nthe long corridor to the end, and the red room is on your left up the\r\nsteps.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have I got that right?\" I said, and repeated his directions. He\r\ncorrected me in one particular.\r\n\r\n\"And are you really going?\" said the man with the shade, looking at me\r\nagain for the third time, with that queer, unnatural tilting of the\r\nface.\r\n\r\n(\"This night of all nights!\" said the old woman.)\r\n\r\n\"It is what I came for,\" I said, and moved towards the door. As I did\r\nso, the old man with the shade rose and staggered round the table, so\r\nas to be closer to the others and to the fire. At the door I turned\r\nand looked at them, and saw they were all close together, dark against\r\nthe firelight, staring at me over their shoulders, with an intent\r\nexpression on their ancient faces.\r\n\r\n\"Good-night,\" I said, setting the door open.\r\n\r\n\"It's your own choosing,\" said the man with the withered arm.\r\n\r\nI left the door wide open until the candle was well alight, and then I\r\nshut them in and walked down the chilly, echoing passage.\r\n\r\nI must confess that the oddness of these three old pensioners in\r\nwhose charge her ladyship had left the castle, and the deep-toned,\r\nold-fashioned furniture of the housekeeper's room in which they\r\nforegathered, affected me in spite of my efforts to keep myself at a\r\nmatter-of-fact phase. They seemed to belong to another age, an older\r\nage, an age when things spiritual were different from this of ours,\r\nless certain; an age when omens and witches were credible, and ghosts\r\nbeyond denying. Their very existence was spectral; the cut of their\r\nclothing, fashions born in dead brains. The ornaments and conveniences\r\nof the room about them were ghostly--the thoughts of vanished men,\r\nwhich still haunted rather than participated in the world of to-day.\r\nBut with an effort I sent such thoughts to the right-about. The long,\r\ndraughty subterranean passage was chilly and dusty, and my candle\r\nflared and made the shadows cower and quiver. The echoes rang up and\r\ndown the spiral staircase, and a shadow came sweeping up after me, and\r\none fled before me into the darkness overhead. I came to the landing\r\nand stopped there for a moment, listening to a rustling that I fancied\r\nI heard; then, satisfied of the absolute silence, I pushed open the\r\nbaize-covered door and stood in the corridor.\r\n\r\nThe effect was scarcely what I expected, for the moonlight, coming\r\nin by the great window on the grand staircase, picked out everything\r\nin vivid black shadow or silvery illumination. Everything was in its\r\nplace: the house might have been deserted on the yesterday instead of\r\neighteen months ago. There were candles in the sockets of the sconces,\r\nand whatever dust had gathered on the carpets or upon the polished\r\nflooring was distributed so evenly as to be invisible in the moonlight.\r\nI was about to advance, and stopped abruptly. A bronze group stood upon\r\nthe landing, hidden from me by the corner of the wall, but its shadow\r\nfell with marvellous distinctness upon the white panelling, and gave\r\nme the impression of someone crouching to waylay me. I stood rigid for\r\nhalf a minute perhaps. Then, with my hand in the pocket that held my\r\nrevolver, I advanced, only to discover a Ganymede and Eagle glistening\r\nin the moonlight. That incident for a time restored my nerve, and a\r\nporcelain Chinaman on a buhl table, whose head rocked silently as I\r\npassed him, scarcely startled me.\r\n\r\nThe door to the red room and the steps up to it were in a shadowy\r\ncorner. I moved my candle from side to side, in order to see clearly\r\nthe nature of the recess in which I stood before opening the door. Here\r\nit was, thought I, that my predecessor was found, and the memory of\r\nthat story gave me a sudden twinge of apprehension. I glanced over my\r\nshoulder at the Ganymede in the moonlight, and opened the door of the\r\nred room rather hastily, with my face half turned to the pallid silence\r\nof the landing.\r\n\r\nI entered, closed the door behind me at once, turned the key I found in\r\nthe lock within, and stood with the candle held aloft, surveying the\r\nscene of my vigil, the great red room of Lorraine Castle, in which the\r\nyoung duke had died. Or, rather, in which he had begun his dying, for\r\nhe had opened the door and fallen headlong down the steps I had just\r\nascended. That had been the end of his vigil, of his gallant attempt to\r\nconquer the ghostly tradition of the place, and never, I thought, had\r\napoplexy better served the ends of superstition. And there were other\r\nand older stories that clung to the room, back to the half-credible\r\nbeginning of it all, the tale of a timid wife and the tragic end that\r\ncame to her husband's jest of frightening her. And looking around that\r\nlarge shadowy room, with its shadowy window bays, its recesses and\r\nalcoves, one could well understand the legends that had sprouted in its\r\nblack corners, its germinating darkness. My candle was a little tongue\r\nof light in its vastness, that failed to pierce the opposite end of the\r\nroom, and left an ocean of mystery and suggestion beyond its island of\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nI resolved to make a systematic examination of the place at once, and\r\ndispel the fanciful suggestions of its obscurity before they obtained a\r\nhold upon me. After satisfying myself of the fastening of the door, I\r\nbegan to walk about the room, peering round each article of furniture,\r\ntucking up the valances of the bed, and opening its curtains wide. I\r\npulled up the blinds and examined the fastenings of the several windows\r\nbefore closing the shutters, leant forward and looked up the blackness\r\nof the wide chimney, and tapped the dark oak panelling for any secret\r\nopening. There were two big mirrors in the room, each with a pair of\r\nsconces bearing candles, and on the mantelshelf, too, were more candles\r\nin china candlesticks. All these I lit one after the other. The fire\r\nwas laid,--an unexpected consideration from the old housekeeper,--and I\r\nlit it, to keep down any disposition to shiver, and when it was burning\r\nwell, I stood round with my back to it and regarded the room again. I\r\nhad pulled up a chintz-covered arm-chair and a table, to form a kind\r\nof barricade before me, and on this lay my revolver ready to hand. My\r\nprecise examination had done me good, but I still found the remoter\r\ndarkness of the place, and its perfect stillness, too stimulating for\r\nthe imagination. The echoing of the stir and crackling of the fire\r\nwas no sort of comfort to me. The shadow in the alcove, at the end\r\nin particular, had that undefinable quality of a presence, that odd\r\nsuggestion of a lurking living thing, that comes so easily in silence\r\nand solitude. At last, to reassure myself, I walked with a candle into\r\nit, and satisfied myself that there was nothing tangible there. I stood\r\nthat candle upon the floor of the alcove, and left it in that position.\r\n\r\nBy this time I was in a state of considerable nervous tension, although\r\nto my reason there was no adequate cause for the condition. My mind,\r\nhowever, was perfectly clear. I postulated quite unreservedly that\r\nnothing supernatural could happen, and to pass the time I began to\r\nstring some rhymes together, Ingoldsby fashion, of the original legend\r\nof the place. A few I spoke aloud, but the echoes were not pleasant.\r\nFor the same reason I also abandoned, after a time, a conversation with\r\nmyself upon the impossibility of ghosts and haunting. My mind reverted\r\nto the three old and distorted people downstairs, and I tried to keep\r\nit upon that topic. The sombre reds and blacks of the room troubled me;\r\neven with seven candles the place was merely dim. The one in the alcove\r\nflared in a draught, and the fire-flickering kept the shadows and\r\npenumbra perpetually shifting and stirring. Casting about for a remedy,\r\nI recalled the candles I had seen in the passage, and, with a slight\r\neffort, walked out into the moonlight, carrying a candle and leaving\r\nthe door open, and presently returned with as many as ten. These I put\r\nin various knick-knacks of china with which the room was sparsely\r\nadorned, lit and placed where the shadows had lain deepest, some on the\r\nfloor, some in the window recesses, until at last my seventeen candles\r\nwere so arranged that not an inch of the room but had the direct light\r\nof at least one of them. It occurred to me that when the ghost came, I\r\ncould warn him not to trip over them. The room was now quite brightly\r\nilluminated. There was something very cheery and reassuring in these\r\nlittle streaming flames, and snuffing them gave me an occupation, and\r\nafforded a reassuring sense of the passage of time.\r\n\r\nEven with that, however, the brooding expectation of the vigil weighed\r\nheavily upon me. It was after midnight that the candle in the alcove\r\nsuddenly went out, and the black shadow sprang back to its place there.\r\nI did not see the candle go out; I simply turned and saw that the\r\ndarkness was there, as one might start and see the unexpected presence\r\nof a stranger. \"By Jove!\" said I aloud; \"that draught's a strong one!\"\r\nand, taking the matches from the table, I walked across the room in a\r\nleisurely manner to relight the corner again. My first match would not\r\nstrike, and as I succeeded with the second, something seemed to blink\r\non the wall before me. I turned my head involuntarily, and saw that the\r\ntwo candles on the little table by the fireplace were extinguished. I\r\nrose at once to my feet.\r\n\r\n\"Odd!\" I said. \"Did I do that myself in a flash of absent-mindedness?\"\r\n\r\nI walked back, relit one, and as I did so, I saw the candle in the\r\nright sconce of one of the mirrors wink and go right out, and almost\r\nimmediately its companion followed it. There was no mistake about it.\r\nThe flame vanished, as if the wicks had been suddenly nipped between a\r\nfinger and a thumb, leaving the wick neither glowing nor smoking, but\r\nblack. While I stood gaping, the candle at the foot of the bed went\r\nout, and the shadows seemed to take another step towards me.\r\n\r\n\"This won't do!\" said I, and first one and then another candle on the\r\nmantelshelf followed.\r\n\r\n\"What's up?\" I cried, with a queer high note getting into my voice\r\nsomehow. At that the candle on the wardrobe went out, and the one I had\r\nrelit in the alcove followed.\r\n\r\n\"Steady on!\" I said. \"These candles are wanted,\" speaking with a\r\nhalf-hysterical facetiousness, and scratching away at a match the\r\nwhile for the mantel candlesticks. My hands trembled so much that\r\ntwice I missed the rough paper of the matchbox. As the mantel emerged\r\nfrom darkness again, two candles in the remoter end of the window\r\nwere eclipsed. But with the same match I also relit the larger mirror\r\ncandles, and those on the floor near the doorway, so that for the\r\nmoment I seemed to gain on the extinctions. But then in a volley there\r\nvanished four lights at once in different corners of the room, and I\r\nstruck another match in quivering haste, and stood hesitating whither\r\nto take it.\r\n\r\nAs I stood undecided, an invisible hand seemed to sweep out the two\r\ncandles on the table. With a cry of terror, I dashed at the alcove,\r\nthen into the corner, and then into the window, relighting three, as\r\ntwo more vanished by the fireplace; then, perceiving a better way,\r\nI dropped the matches on the iron-bound deed-box in the corner, and\r\ncaught up the bedroom candlestick. With this I avoided the delay of\r\nstriking matches; but for all that the steady process of extinction\r\nwent on, and the shadows I feared and fought against returned, and\r\ncrept in upon me, first a step gained on this side of me and then on\r\nthat. It was like a ragged storm-cloud sweeping out the stars. Now and\r\nthen one returned for a minute, and was lost again. I was now almost\r\nfrantic with the horror of the coming darkness, and my self-possession\r\ndeserted me. I leaped panting and dishevelled from candle to candle, in\r\na vain struggle against that remorseless advance.\r\n\r\nI bruised myself on the thigh against the table, I sent a chair\r\nheadlong, I stumbled and fell and whisked the cloth from the table in\r\nmy fall. My candle rolled away from me, and I snatched another as I\r\nrose. Abruptly this was blown out, as I swung it off the table, by the\r\nwind of my sudden movement, and immediately the two remaining candles\r\nfollowed. But there was light still in the room, a red light that\r\nstaved off the shadows from me. The fire! Of course, I could still\r\nthrust my candle between the bars and relight it!\r\n\r\nI turned to where the flames were still dancing between the glowing\r\ncoals, and splashing red reflections upon the furniture, made two steps\r\ntowards the grate, and incontinently the flames dwindled and vanished,\r\nthe glow vanished, the reflections rushed together and vanished, and\r\nas I thrust the candle between the bars, darkness closed upon me like\r\nthe shutting of an eye, wrapped about me in a stifling embrace, sealed\r\nmy vision, and crushed the last vestiges of reason from my brain. The\r\ncandle fell from my hand. I flung out my arms in a vain effort to\r\nthrust that ponderous blackness away from me, and, lifting up my voice,\r\nscreamed with all my might--once, twice, thrice. Then I think I must\r\nhave staggered to my feet. I know I thought suddenly of the moonlit\r\ncorridor, and, with my head bowed and my arms over my face, made a run\r\nfor the door.\r\n\r\nBut I had forgotten the exact position of the door, and struck myself\r\nheavily against the corner of the bed. I staggered back, turned, and\r\nwas either struck or struck myself against some other bulky furniture.\r\nI have a vague memory of battering myself thus, to and fro in the\r\ndarkness, of a cramped struggle, and of my own wild crying as I darted\r\nto and fro, of a heavy blow at last upon my forehead, a horrible\r\nsensation of falling that lasted an age, of my last frantic effort to\r\nkeep my footing, and then I remember no more.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI opened my eyes in daylight. My head was roughly bandaged, and the man\r\nwith the withered arm was watching my face. I looked about me, trying\r\nto remember what had happened, and for a space I could not recollect.\r\nI rolled my eyes into the corner, and saw the old woman, no longer\r\nabstracted, pouring out some drops of medicine from a little blue\r\nphial into a glass. \"Where am I?\" I asked. \"I seem to remember you, and\r\nyet I cannot remember who you are.\"\r\n\r\nThey told me then, and I heard of the haunted Red Room as one who hears\r\na tale. \"We found you at dawn,\" said he, \"and there was blood on your\r\nforehead and lips.\"\r\n\r\nIt was very slowly I recovered my memory of my experience. \"You believe\r\nnow,\" said the old man, \"that the room is haunted?\" He spoke no longer\r\nas one who greets an intruder, but as one who grieves for a broken\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said I; \"the room is haunted.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you have seen it. And we, who have lived here all our lives, have\r\nnever set eyes upon it. Because we have never dared.... Tell us, is it\r\ntruly the old earl who\"--\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said I; \"it is not.\"\r\n\r\n\"I told you so,\" said the old lady, with the glass in her hand. \"It is\r\nhis poor young countess who was frightened\"--\r\n\r\n\"It is not,\" I said. \"There is neither ghost of earl nor ghost of\r\ncountess in that room, there is no ghost there at all; but worse, far\r\nworse\"--\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" they said.\r\n\r\n\"The worst of all the things that haunt poor mortal man,\" said I; \"and\r\nthat is, in all its nakedness--_Fear!_ Fear that will not have light\r\nnor sound, that will not bear with reason, that deafens and darkens and\r\noverwhelms. It followed me through the corridor, it fought against me\r\nin the room\"--\r\n\r\nI stopped abruptly. There was an interval of silence. My hand went up\r\nto my bandages.\r\n\r\nThen the man with the shade sighed and spoke. \"That is it,\" said he.\r\n\"I knew that was it. A Power of Darkness. To put such a curse upon a\r\nwoman! It lurks there always. You can feel it even in the daytime, even\r\nof a bright summer's day, in the hangings, in the curtains, keeping\r\nbehind you however you face about. In the dusk it creeps along the\r\ncorridor and follows you, so that you dare not turn. There is Fear in\r\nthat room of hers--black Fear, and there will be--so long as this house\r\nof sin endures.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe night was hot and overcast, the sky red-rimmed with the lingering\r\nsunset of midsummer. They sat at the open window, trying to fancy the\r\nair was fresher there. The trees and shrubs of the garden stood stiff\r\nand dark; beyond in the roadway a gas-lamp burnt, bright orange against\r\nthe hazy blue of the evening. Farther were the three lights of the\r\nrailway signal against the lowering sky. The man and woman spoke to one\r\nanother in low tones.\r\n\r\n\"He does not suspect?\" said the man, a little nervously.\r\n\r\n\"Not he,\" she said peevishly, as though that too irritated her. \"He\r\nthinks of nothing but the works and the prices of fuel. He has no\r\nimagination, no poetry.\"\r\n\r\n\"None of these men of iron have,\" he said sententiously. \"They have no\r\nhearts.\"\r\n\r\n\"_He_ has not,\" she said. She turned her discontented face towards the\r\nwindow. The distant sound of a roaring and rushing drew nearer and\r\ngrew in volume; the house quivered; one heard the metallic rattle of\r\nthe tender. As the train passed, there was a glare of light above the\r\ncutting and a driving tumult of smoke; one, two, three, four, five,\r\nsix, seven, eight black oblongs--eight trucks--passed across the dim\r\ngrey of the embankment, and were suddenly extinguished one by one in\r\nthe throat of the tunnel, which, with the last, seemed to swallow down\r\ntrain, smoke, and sound in one abrupt gulp.\r\n\r\n\"This country was all fresh and beautiful once,\" he said; \"and now--it\r\nis Gehenna. Down that way--nothing but pot-banks and chimneys belching\r\nfire and dust into the face of heaven.... But what does it matter? An\r\nend comes, an end to all this cruelty.... _To-morrow._\" He spoke the\r\nlast word in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\"_To-morrow_,\" she said, speaking in a whisper too, and still staring\r\nout of the window.\r\n\r\n\"Dear!\" he said, putting his hand on hers.\r\n\r\nShe turned with a start, and their eyes searched one another's. Hers\r\nsoftened to his gaze. \"My dear one!\" she said, and then: \"It seems\r\nso strange--that you should have come into my life like this--to\r\nopen\"-- She paused.\r\n\r\n\"To open?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"All this wonderful world\"--she hesitated, and spoke still more\r\nsoftly--\"this world of _love_ to me.\"\r\n\r\nThen suddenly the door clicked and closed. They turned their heads,\r\nand he started violently back. In the shadow of the room stood a great\r\nshadowy figure--silent. They saw the face dimly in the half-light, with\r\nunexpressive dark patches under the penthouse brows. Every muscle in\r\nRaut's body suddenly became tense. When could the door have opened?\r\nWhat had he heard? Had he heard all? What had he seen? A tumult of\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\nThe new-comer's voice came at last, after a pause that seemed\r\ninterminable. \"Well?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I was afraid I had missed you, Horrocks,\" said the man at the window,\r\ngripping the window-ledge with his hand. His voice was unsteady.\r\n\r\nThe clumsy figure of Horrocks came forward out of the shadow. He made\r\nno answer to Raut's remark. For a moment he stood above them.\r\n\r\nThe woman's heart was cold within her. \"I told Mr. Raut it was just\r\npossible you might come back,\" she said, in a voice that never quivered.\r\n\r\nHorrocks, still silent, sat down abruptly in the chair by her little\r\nwork-table. His big hands were clenched; one saw now the fire of his\r\neyes under the shadow of his brows. He was trying to get his breath.\r\nHis eyes went from the woman he had trusted to the friend he had\r\ntrusted, and then back to the woman.\r\n\r\nBy this time and for the moment all three half understood one another.\r\nYet none dared say a word to ease the pent-up things that choked them.\r\n\r\nIt was the husband's voice that broke the silence at last.\r\n\r\n\"You wanted to see me?\" he said to Raut.\r\n\r\nRaut started as he spoke. \"I came to see you,\" he said, resolved to lie\r\nto the last.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Horrocks.\r\n\r\n\"You promised,\" said Raut, \"to show me some fine effects of moonlight\r\nand smoke.\"\r\n\r\n\"I promised to show you some fine effects of moonlight and smoke,\"\r\nrepeated Horrocks in a colourless voice.\r\n\r\n\"And I thought I might catch you to-night before you went down to the\r\nworks,\" proceeded Raut, \"and come with you.\"\r\n\r\nThere was another pause. Did the man mean to take the thing coolly? Did\r\nhe after all know? How long had he been in the room? Yet even at the\r\nmoment when they heard the door, their attitudes.... Horrocks glanced\r\nat the profile of the woman, shadowy pallid in the half-light. Then he\r\nglanced at Raut, and seemed to recover himself suddenly. \"Of course,\"\r\nhe said, \"I promised to show you the works under their proper dramatic\r\nconditions. It's odd how I could have forgotten.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I am troubling you\"--began Raut.\r\n\r\nHorrocks started again. A new light had suddenly come into the sultry\r\ngloom of his eyes. \"Not in the least,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Have you been telling Mr. Raut of all these contrasts of flame and\r\nshadow you think so splendid?\" said the woman, turning now to her\r\nhusband for the first time, her confidence creeping back again, her\r\nvoice just one half-note too high. \"That dreadful theory of yours\r\nthat machinery is beautiful, and everything else in the world ugly. I\r\nthought he would not spare you, Mr. Raut. It's his great theory, his\r\none discovery in art.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am slow to make discoveries,\" said Horrocks grimly, damping her\r\nsuddenly. \"But what I discover....\" He stopped.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing;\" and suddenly he rose to his feet.\r\n\r\n\"I promised to show you the works,\" he said to Raut, and put his big,\r\nclumsy hand on his friend's shoulder. \"And you are ready to go?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite,\" said Raut, and stood up also.\r\n\r\nThere was another pause. Each of them peered through the indistinctness\r\nof the dusk at the other two. Horrock's hand still rested on Raut's\r\nshoulder. Raut half fancied still that the incident was trivial after\r\nall. But Mrs. Horrocks knew her husband better, knew that grim quiet in\r\nhis voice, and the confusion in her mind took a vague shape of physical\r\nevil. \"Very well,\" said Horrocks, and, dropping his hand, turned\r\ntowards the door.\r\n\r\n\"My hat?\" Raut looked round in the half-light.\r\n\r\n\"That's my work-basket,\" said Mrs. Horrocks, with a gust of hysterical\r\nlaughter. Their hands came together on the back of the chair. \"Here it\r\nis!\" he said. She had an impulse to warn him in an undertone, but she\r\ncould not frame a word. \"Don't go!\" and \"Beware of him!\" struggled in\r\nher mind, and the swift moment passed.\r\n\r\n\"Got it?\" said Horrocks, standing with the door half open.\r\n\r\nRaut stepped towards him. \"Better say good-bye to Mrs. Horrocks,\" said\r\nthe ironmaster, even more grimly quiet in his tone than before.\r\n\r\nRaut started and turned. \"Good-evening, Mrs. Horrocks,\" he said, and\r\ntheir hands touched.\r\n\r\nHorrocks held the door open with a ceremonial politeness unusual in\r\nhim towards men. Raut went out, and then, after a wordless look at\r\nher, her husband followed. She stood motionless while Raut's light\r\nfootfall and her husband's heavy tread, like bass and treble, passed\r\ndown the passage together. The front door slammed heavily. She went to\r\nthe window, moving slowly, and stood watching--leaning forward. The two\r\nmen appeared for a moment at the gateway in the road, passed under the\r\nstreet lamp, and were hidden by the black masses of the shrubbery. The\r\nlamplight fell for a moment on their faces, showing only unmeaning pale\r\npatches, telling nothing of what she still feared, and doubted, and\r\ncraved vainly to know. Then she sank down into a crouching attitude in\r\nthe big arm-chair, her eyes wide open and staring out at the red lights\r\nfrom the furnaces that flickered in the sky. An hour after she was\r\nstill there, her attitude scarcely changed.\r\n\r\nThe oppressive stillness of the evening weighed heavily upon Raut. They\r\nwent side by side down the road in silence, and in silence turned into\r\nthe cinder-made by-way that presently opened out the prospect of the\r\nvalley.\r\n\r\nA blue haze, half dust, half mist, touched the long valley with\r\nmystery. Beyond were Hanley and Etruria, grey and dark masses,\r\noutlined thinly by the rare golden dots of the street lamps, and here\r\nand there a gaslit window, or the yellow glare of some late-working\r\nfactory or crowded public-house. Out of the masses, clear and slender\r\nagainst the evening sky, rose a multitude of tall chimneys, many of\r\nthem reeking, a few smokeless during a season of \"play.\" Here and\r\nthere a pallid patch and ghostly stunted beehive shapes showed the\r\nposition of a pot-bank, or a wheel, black and sharp against the hot\r\nlower sky, marked some colliery where they raise the iridescent coal\r\nof the place. Nearer at hand was the broad stretch of railway, and\r\nhalf invisible trains shunted--a steady puffing and rumbling, with\r\nevery run a ringing concussion and a rhythmic series of impacts, and a\r\npassage of intermittent puffs of white steam across the further view.\r\nAnd to the left, between the railway and the dark mass of the low hill\r\nbeyond, dominating the whole view, colossal, inky-black, and crowned\r\nwith smoke and fitful flames, stood the great cylinders of the Jeddah\r\nCompany Blast Furnaces, the central edifices of the big ironworks of\r\nwhich Horrocks was the manager. They stood heavy and threatening, full\r\nof an incessant turmoil of flames and seething molten iron, and about\r\nthe feet of them rattled the rolling-mills, and the steam-hammer beat\r\nheavily and splashed the white iron sparks hither and thither. Even as\r\nthey looked, a truckful of fuel was shot into one of the giants, and\r\nthe red flames gleamed out, and a confusion of smoke and black dust\r\ncame boiling upwards towards the sky.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly you get some fine effects of colour with your furnaces,\"\r\nsaid Raut, breaking a silence that had become apprehensive.\r\n\r\nHorrocks grunted. He stood with his hands in his pockets, frowning down\r\nat the dim steaming railway and the busy ironworks beyond, frowning as\r\nif he were thinking out some knotty problem.\r\n\r\nRaut glanced at him and away again. \"At present your moonlight effect\r\nis hardly ripe,\" he continued, looking upward; \"the moon is still\r\nsmothered by the vestiges of daylight.\"\r\n\r\nHorrocks stared at him with the expression of a man who has suddenly\r\nawakened. \"Vestiges of daylight?... Of course, of course.\" He too\r\nlooked up at the moon, pale still in the midsummer sky. \"Come along,\"\r\nhe said suddenly, and, gripping Raut's arm in his hand, made a move\r\ntowards the path that dropped from them to the railway.\r\n\r\nRaut hung back. Their eyes met and saw a thousand things in a moment\r\nthat their lips came near to say. Horrocks's hand tightened and then\r\nrelaxed. He let go, and before Raut was aware of it, they were arm in\r\narm, and walking, one unwillingly enough, down the path.\r\n\r\n\"You see the fine effect of the railway signals towards Burslem,\"\r\nsaid Horrocks, suddenly breaking into loquacity, striding fast and\r\ntightening the grip of his elbow the while. \"Little green lights\r\nand red and white lights, all against the haze. You have an eye for\r\neffect, Raut. It's a fine effect. And look at those furnaces of mine,\r\nhow they rise upon us as we come down the hill. That to the right is\r\nmy pet--seventy feet of him. I packed him myself, and he's boiled\r\naway cheerfully with iron in his guts for five long years. I've a\r\nparticular fancy for _him_. That line of red there--a lovely bit of\r\nwarm orange you'd call it, Raut--that's the puddlers' furnaces, and\r\nthere, in the hot light, three black figures--did you see the white\r\nsplash of the steam-hammer then?--that's the rolling-mills. Come along!\r\nClang, clatter, how it goes rattling across the floor! Sheet tin,\r\nRaut,--amazing stuff. Glass mirrors are not in it when that stuff comes\r\nfrom the mill. And, squelch!--there goes the hammer again. Come along!\"\r\n\r\nHe had to stop talking to catch at his breath. His arm twisted into\r\nRaut's with benumbing tightness. He had come striding down the black\r\npath towards the railway as though he was possessed. Raut had not\r\nspoken a word, had simply hung back against Horrocks's pull with all\r\nhis strength.\r\n\r\n\"I say,\" he said now, laughing nervously, but with an undernote of\r\nsnarl in his voice, \"why on earth are you nipping my arm off, Horrocks,\r\nand dragging me along like this?\"\r\n\r\nAt length Horrocks released him. His manner changed again. \"Nipping\r\nyour arm off?\" he said. \"Sorry. But it's you taught me the trick of\r\nwalking in that friendly way.\"\r\n\r\n\"You haven't learnt the refinements of it yet then,\" said Raut,\r\nlaughing artificially again. \"By Jove! I'm black and blue.\" Horrocks\r\noffered no apology. They stood now near the bottom of the hill, close\r\nto the fence that bordered the railway. The ironworks had grown larger\r\nand spread out with their approach. They looked up to the blast\r\nfurnaces now instead of down; the further view of Etruria and Hanley\r\nhad dropped out of sight with their descent. Before them, by the stile,\r\nrose a notice-board, bearing, still dimly visible, the words, \"BEWARE\r\nOF THE TRAINS,\" half hidden by splashes of coaly mud.\r\n\r\n\"Fine effects,\" said Horrocks, waving his arm. \"Here comes a train. The\r\npuffs of smoke, the orange glare, the round eye of light in front of\r\nit, the melodious rattle. Fine effects! But these furnaces of mine used\r\nto be finer, before we shoved cones in their throats, and saved the\r\ngas.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\" said Raut. \"Cones?\"\r\n\r\n\"Cones, my man, cones. I'll show you one nearer. The flames used to\r\nflare out of the open throats, great--what is it?--pillars of cloud by\r\nday, red and black smoke, and pillars of fire by night. Now we run it\r\noff in pipes, and burn it to heat the blast, and the top is shut by a\r\ncone. You'll be interested in that cone.\"\r\n\r\n\"But every now and then,\" said Raut, \"you get a burst of fire and smoke\r\nup there.\"\r\n\r\n\"The cone's not fixed, it's hung by a chain from a lever, and balanced\r\nby an equipoise. You shall see it nearer. Else, of course, there'd be\r\nno way of getting fuel into the thing. Every now and then the cone\r\ndips, and out comes the flare.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" said Raut. He looked over his shoulder. \"The moon gets\r\nbrighter,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Come along,\" said Horrocks abruptly, gripping his shoulder again, and\r\nmoving him suddenly towards the railway crossing. And then came one of\r\nthose swift incidents, vivid, but so rapid that they leave one doubtful\r\nand reeling. Halfway across, Horrocks's hand suddenly clenched upon him\r\nlike a vice and swung him backward and through a half-turn, so that\r\nhe looked up the line. And there a chain of lamp-lit carriage-windows\r\ntelescoped swiftly as it came towards them, and the red and yellow\r\nlights of an engine grew larger and larger, rushing down upon them.\r\nAs he grasped what this meant, he turned his face to Horrocks, and\r\npushed with all his strength against the arm that held him back between\r\nthe rails. The struggle did not last a moment. Just as certain as it\r\nwas that Horrocks held him there, so certain was it that he had been\r\nviolently lugged out of danger.\r\n\r\n\"Out of the way,\" said Horrocks, with a gasp, as the train came\r\nrattling by, and they stood panting by the gate into the ironworks.\r\n\r\n\"I did not see it coming,\" said Raut, still, even in spite of his own\r\napprehensions, trying to keep up an appearance of ordinary intercourse.\r\n\r\nHorrocks answered with a grunt. \"The cone,\" he said, and then, as one\r\nwho recovers himself, \"I thought you did not hear.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't,\" said Raut.\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't have had you run over then for the world,\" said Horrocks.\r\n\r\n\"For a moment I lost my nerve,\" said Raut.\r\n\r\nHorrocks stood for half a minute, then turned abruptly towards the\r\nironworks again. \"See how fine these great mounds of mine, these\r\nclinker-heaps, look in the night! That truck yonder, up above there!\r\nUp it goes, and out-tilts the slag. See the palpitating red stuff go\r\nsliding down the slope. As we get nearer, the heap rises up and cuts\r\nthe blast furnaces. See the quiver up above the big one. Not that\r\nway! This way, between the heaps. That goes to the puddling furnaces,\r\nbut I want to show you the canal first.\" He came and took Raut by the\r\nelbow, and so they went along side by side. Raut answered Horrocks\r\nvaguely. What, he asked himself, had really happened on the line? Was\r\nhe deluding himself with his own fancies, or had Horrocks actually held\r\nhim back in the way of the train? Had he just been within an ace of\r\nbeing murdered?\r\n\r\nSuppose this slouching, scowling monster _did_ know anything? For a\r\nminute or two then Raut was really afraid for his life, but the mood\r\npassed as he reasoned with himself. After all, Horrocks might have\r\nheard nothing. At anyrate, he had pulled him out of the way in time.\r\nHis odd manner might be due to the mere vague jealousy he had shown\r\nonce before. He was talking now of the ash-heaps and the canal. \"Eigh?\"\r\nsaid Horrocks.\r\n\r\n\"What?\" said Raut. \"Rather! The haze in the moonlight. Fine!\"\r\n\r\n\"Our canal,\" said Horrocks, stopping suddenly. \"Our canal by moonlight\r\nand firelight is an immense effect. You've never seen it? Fancy that!\r\nYou've spent too many of your evenings philandering up in Newcastle\r\nthere. I tell you, for real florid effects-- But you shall see. Boiling\r\nwater....\"\r\n\r\nAs they came out of the labyrinth of clinker-heaps and mounds of coal\r\nand ore, the noises of the rolling-mill sprang upon them suddenly,\r\nloud, near, and distinct. Three shadowy workmen went by and touched\r\ntheir caps to Horrocks. Their faces were vague in the darkness. Raut\r\nfelt a futile impulse to address them, and before he could frame\r\nhis words, they passed into the shadows. Horrocks pointed to the\r\ncanal close before them now: a weird-looking place it seemed, in the\r\nblood-red reflections of the furnaces. The hot water that cooled the\r\ntuyères came into it, some fifty yards up--a tumultuous, almost boiling\r\naffluent, and the steam rose up from the water in silent white wisps\r\nand streaks, wrapping damply about them, an incessant succession of\r\nghosts coming up from the black and red eddies, a white uprising that\r\nmade the head swim. The shining black tower of the larger blast-furnace\r\nrose overhead out of the mist, and its tumultuous riot filled their\r\nears. Raut kept away from the edge of the water, and watched Horrocks.\r\n\r\n\"Here it is red,\" said Horrocks, \"blood-red vapour as red and hot as\r\nsin; but yonder there, where the moonlight falls on it, and it drives\r\nacross the clinker-heaps, it is as white as death.\"\r\n\r\nRaut turned his head for a moment, and then came back hastily to his\r\nwatch on Horrocks. \"Come along to the rolling-mills,\" said Horrocks.\r\nThe threatening hold was not so evident that time, and Raut felt a\r\nlittle reassured. But all the same, what on earth did Horrocks mean\r\nabout \"white as death\" and \"red as sin\"? Coincidence, perhaps?\r\n\r\nThey went and stood behind the puddlers for a little while, and then\r\nthrough the rolling-mills, where amidst an incessant din the deliberate\r\nsteam-hammer beat the juice out of the succulent iron, and black,\r\nhalf-naked Titans rushed the plastic bars, like hot sealing-wax,\r\nbetween the wheels. \"Come on,\" said Horrocks in Raut's ear, and they\r\nwent and peeped through the little glass hole behind the tuyères, and\r\nsaw the tumbled fire writhing in the pit of the blast-furnace. It left\r\none eye blinded for a while. Then, with green and blue patches dancing\r\nacross the dark, they went to the lift by which the trucks of ore and\r\nfuel and lime were raised to the top of the big cylinder.\r\n\r\nAnd out upon the narrow rail that overhung the furnace, Raut's\r\ndoubts came upon him again. Was it wise to be here? If Horrocks did\r\nknow--everything! Do what he would, he could not resist a violent\r\ntrembling. Right under foot was a sheer depth of seventy feet. It was a\r\ndangerous place. They pushed by a truck of fuel to get to the railing\r\nthat crowned the place. The reek of the furnace, a sulphurous vapour\r\nstreaked with pungent bitterness, seemed to make the distant hillside\r\nof Hanley quiver. The moon was riding out now from among a drift of\r\nclouds, half-way up the sky above the undulating wooded outlines\r\nof Newcastle. The steaming canal ran away from below them under an\r\nindistinct bridge, and vanished into the dim haze of the flat fields\r\ntowards Burslem.\r\n\r\n\"That's the cone I've been telling you of,\" shouted Horrocks; \"and,\r\nbelow that, sixty feet of fire and molten metal, with the air of the\r\nblast frothing through it like gas in soda-water.\"\r\n\r\nRaut gripped the hand-rail tightly, and stared down at the cone. The\r\nheat was intense. The boiling of the iron and the tumult of the blast\r\nmade a thunderous accompaniment to Horrocks's voice. But the thing had\r\nto be gone through now. Perhaps, after all....\r\n\r\n\"In the middle,\" bawled Horrocks, \"temperature near a thousand degrees.\r\nIf _you_ were dropped into it ... flash into flame like a pinch of\r\ngunpowder in a candle. Put your hand out and feel the heat of his\r\nbreath. Why, even up here I've seen the rain-water boiling off the\r\ntrucks. And that cone there. It's a damned sight too hot for roasting\r\ncakes. The top side of it's three hundred degrees.\"\r\n\r\n\"Three hundred degrees!\" said Raut.\r\n\r\n\"Three hundred centigrade, mind!\" said Horrocks. \"It will boil the\r\nblood out of you in no time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eigh?\" said Raut, and turned.\r\n\r\n\"Boil the blood out of you in.... No, you don't!\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me go!\" screamed Raut. \"Let go my arm!\"\r\n\r\nWith one hand he clutched at the hand-rail, then with both. For a\r\nmoment the two men stood swaying. Then suddenly, with a violent jerk,\r\nHorrocks had twisted him from his hold. He clutched at Horrocks and\r\nmissed, his foot went back into empty air; in mid-air he twisted\r\nhimself, and then cheek and shoulder and knee struck the hot cone\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nHe clutched the chain by which the cone hung, and the thing sank an\r\ninfinitesimal amount as he struck it. A circle of glowing red appeared\r\nabout him, and a tongue of flame, released from the chaos within,\r\nflickered up towards him. An intense pain assailed him at the knees,\r\nand he could smell the singeing of his hands. He raised himself to his\r\nfeet, and tried to climb up the chain, and then something struck his\r\nhead. Black and shining with the moonlight, the throat of the furnace\r\nrose about him.\r\n\r\nHorrocks, he saw, stood above him by one of the trucks of fuel on the\r\nrail. The gesticulating figure was bright and white in the moonlight,\r\nand shouting, \"Fizzle, you fool! Fizzle, you hunter of women! You\r\nhot-blooded hound! Boil! boil! boil!\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly he caught up a handful of coal out of the truck, and flung it\r\ndeliberately, lump after lump, at Raut.\r\n\r\n\"Horrocks!\" cried Raut. \"Horrocks!\"\r\n\r\nHe clung crying to the chain, pulling himself up from the burning of\r\nthe cone. Each missile Horrocks flung hit him. His clothes charred\r\nand glowed, and as he struggled the cone dropped, and a rush of hot\r\nsuffocating gas whooped out and burned round him in a swift breath of\r\nflame.\r\n\r\nHis human likeness departed from him. When the momentary red had\r\npassed, Horrocks saw a charred, blackened figure, its head streaked\r\nwith blood, still clutching and fumbling with the chain, and writhing\r\nin agony--a cindery animal, an inhuman, monstrous creature that began a\r\nsobbing intermittent shriek.\r\n\r\nAbruptly, at the sight, the ironmaster's anger passed. A deadly\r\nsickness came upon him. The heavy odour of burning flesh came drifting\r\nup to his nostrils. His sanity returned to him.\r\n\r\n\"God have mercy upon me!\" he cried. \"O God! what have I done?\"\r\n\r\nHe knew the thing below him, save that it still moved and felt, was\r\nalready a dead man--that the blood of the poor wretch must be boiling\r\nin his veins. An intense realisation of that agony came to his mind,\r\nand overcame every other feeling. For a moment he stood irresolute, and\r\nthen, turning to the truck, he hastily tilted its contents upon the\r\nstruggling thing that had once been a man. The mass fell with a thud,\r\nand went radiating over the cone. With the thud the shriek ended, and\r\na boiling confusion of smoke, dust, and flame came rushing up towards\r\nhim. As it passed, he saw the cone clear again.\r\n\r\nThen he staggered back, and stood trembling, clinging to the rail with\r\nboth hands. His lips moved, but no words came to them.\r\n\r\nDown below was the sound of voices and running steps. The clangour of\r\nrolling in the shed ceased abruptly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PURPLE PILEUS\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Coombes was sick of life. He walked away from his unhappy home,\r\nand, sick not only of his own existence, but of everybody else's,\r\nturned aside down Gaswork Lane to avoid the town, and, crossing the\r\nwooden bridge that goes over the canal to Starling's Cottages, was\r\npresently alone in the damp pinewoods and out of sight and sound of\r\nhuman habitation. He would stand it no longer. He repeated aloud with\r\nblasphemies unusual to him that he would stand it no longer.\r\n\r\nHe was a pale-faced little man, with dark eyes and a fine and very\r\nblack moustache. He had a very stiff, upright collar slightly frayed,\r\nthat gave him an illusory double chin, and his overcoat (albeit\r\nshabby) was trimmed with astrachan. His gloves were a bright brown\r\nwith black stripes over the knuckles, and split at the finger ends.\r\nHis appearance, his wife had said once in the dear, dead days beyond\r\nrecall,--before he married her, that is,--was military. But now she\r\ncalled him-- It seems a dreadful thing to tell of between husband and\r\nwife, but she called him \"a little grub.\" It wasn't the only thing she\r\nhad called him, either.\r\n\r\nThe row had arisen about that beastly Jennie again. Jennie was his\r\nwife's friend, and, by no invitation of Mr. Coombes, she came in every\r\nblessed Sunday to dinner, and made a shindy all the afternoon. She was\r\na big, noisy girl, with a taste for loud colours and a strident laugh;\r\nand this Sunday she had outdone all her previous intrusions by bringing\r\nin a fellow with her, a chap as showy as herself. And Mr. Coombes,\r\nin a starchy, clean collar and his Sunday frock-coat, had sat dumb\r\nand wrathful at his own table, while his wife and her guests talked\r\nfoolishly and undesirably, and laughed aloud. Well, he stood that, and\r\nafter dinner (which, \"as usual,\" was late), what must Miss Jennie do\r\nbut go to the piano and play banjo tunes, for all the world as if it\r\nwere a week-day! Flesh and blood could not endure such goings on. They\r\nwould hear next door, they would hear in the road, it was a public\r\nannouncement of their disrepute. He had to speak.\r\n\r\nHe had felt himself go pale, and a kind of rigour had affected his\r\nrespiration as he delivered himself. He had been sitting on one of\r\nthe chairs by the window--the new guest had taken possession of the\r\narm-chair. He turned his head. \"Sun Day!\" he said over the collar, in\r\nthe voice of one who warns. \"Sun Day!\" What people call a \"nasty\" tone\r\nit was.\r\n\r\nJennie had kept on playing, but his wife, who was looking through\r\nsome music that was piled on the top of the piano, had stared at him.\r\n\"What's wrong now?\" she said; \"can't people enjoy themselves?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't mind rational 'njoyment, at all,\" said little Coombes, \"but I\r\nain't a-going to have week-day tunes playing on a Sunday in this house.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's wrong with my playing now?\" said Jennie, stopping and twirling\r\nround on the music-stool with a monstrous rustle of flounces.\r\n\r\nCoombes saw it was going to be a row, and opened too vigorously, as is\r\ncommon with your timid, nervous men all the world over. \"Steady on with\r\nthat music-stool!\" said he; \"it ain't made for 'eavy weights.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never you mind about weights,\" said Jennie, incensed. \"What was you\r\nsaying behind my back about my playing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely you don't 'old with not having a bit of music on a Sunday, Mr.\r\nCoombes?\" said the new guest, leaning back in the arm-chair, blowing\r\na cloud of cigarette smoke and smiling in a kind of pitying way. And\r\nsimultaneously his wife said something to Jennie about \"Never mind 'im.\r\nYou go on, Jinny.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do,\" said Mr. Coombes, addressing the new guest.\r\n\r\n\"May I arst why?\" said the new guest, evidently enjoying both his\r\ncigarette and the prospect of an argument. He was, by the bye, a lank\r\nyoung man, very stylishly dressed in bright drab, with a white cravat\r\nand a pearl and silver pin. It had been better taste to come in a black\r\ncoat, Mr. Coombes thought.\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" began Mr. Coombes, \"it don't suit me. I'm a business man. I\r\n'ave to study my connection. Rational 'njoyment\"--\r\n\r\n\"His connection!\" said Mrs. Coombes scornfully. \"That's what he's\r\nalways a-saying. We got to do this, and we got to do that\"--\r\n\r\n\"If you don't mean to study my connection,\" said Mr. Coombes, \"what did\r\nyou marry me for?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder,\" said Jennie, and turned back to the piano.\r\n\r\n\"I never saw such a man as you,\" said Mrs. Coombes. \"You've altered all\r\nround since we were married. Before\"--\r\n\r\nThen Jennie began at the tum, tum, tum again.\r\n\r\n\"Look here!\" said Mr. Coombes, driven at last to revolt, standing up\r\nand raising his voice. \"I tell you I won't have that.\" The frock-coat\r\nheaved with his indignation.\r\n\r\n\"No vi'lence, now,\" said the long young man in drab, sitting up.\r\n\r\n\"Who the juice are you?\" said Mr. Coombes fiercely.\r\n\r\nWhereupon they all began talking at once. The new guest said he was\r\nJennie's \"intended,\" and meant to protect her, and Mr. Coombes said he\r\nwas welcome to do so anywhere but in his (Mr. Coombes') house; and Mrs.\r\nCoombes said he ought to be ashamed of insulting his guests, and (as I\r\nhave already mentioned) that he was getting a regular little grub; and\r\nthe end was, that Mr. Coombes ordered his visitors out of the house,\r\nand they wouldn't go, and so he said he would go himself. With his face\r\nburning and tears of excitement in his eyes, he went into the passage,\r\nand as he struggled with his overcoat--his frock-coat sleeves got\r\nconcertinaed up his arm--and gave a brush at his silk hat, Jennie began\r\nagain at the piano, and strummed him insultingly out of the house.\r\nTum, tum, tum. He slammed the shop door so that the house quivered.\r\nThat, briefly, was the immediate making of his mood. You will perhaps\r\nbegin to understand his disgust with existence.\r\n\r\nAs he walked along the muddy path under the firs,--it was late October,\r\nand the ditches and heaps of fir needles were gorgeous with clumps of\r\nfungi,--he recapitulated the melancholy history of his marriage. It\r\nwas brief and commonplace enough. He now perceived with sufficient\r\nclearness that his wife had married him out of a natural curiosity\r\nand in order to escape from her worrying, laborious, and uncertain\r\nlife in the workroom; and, like the majority of her class, she was\r\nfar too stupid to realise that it was her duty to co-operate with\r\nhim in his business. She was greedy of enjoyment, loquacious, and\r\nsocially-minded, and evidently disappointed to find the restraints of\r\npoverty still hanging about her. His worries exasperated her, and the\r\nslightest attempt to control her proceedings resulted in a charge of\r\n\"grumbling.\" Why couldn't he be nice--as he used to be? And Coombes was\r\nsuch a harmless little man, too, nourished mentally on _Self-Help_, and\r\nwith a meagre ambition of self-denial and competition, that was to end\r\nin a \"sufficiency.\" Then Jennie came in as a female Mephistopheles,\r\na gabbling chronicle of \"fellers,\" and was always wanting his wife\r\nto go to theatres, and \"all that.\" And in addition were aunts of his\r\nwife, and cousins (male and female), to eat up capital, insult him\r\npersonally, upset business arrangements, annoy good customers, and\r\ngenerally blight his life. It was not the first occasion by many\r\nthat Mr. Coombes had fled his home in wrath and indignation, and\r\nsomething like fear, vowing furiously and even aloud that he wouldn't\r\nstand it, and so frothing away his energy along the line of least\r\nresistance. But never before had he been quite so sick of life as on\r\nthis particular Sunday afternoon. The Sunday dinner may have had its\r\nshare in his despair--and the greyness of the sky. Perhaps, too, he\r\nwas beginning to realise his unendurable frustration as a business man\r\nas the consequence of his marriage. Presently bankruptcy, and after\r\nthat-- Perhaps she might have reason to repent when it was too late.\r\nAnd destiny, as I have already intimated, had planted the path through\r\nthe wood with evil-smelling fungi, thickly and variously planted it,\r\nnot only on the right side, but on the left.\r\n\r\nA small shopman is in such a melancholy position, if his wife turns out\r\na disloyal partner. His capital is all tied up in his business, and to\r\nleave her, means to join the unemployed in some strange part of the\r\nearth. The luxuries of divorce are beyond him altogether. So that the\r\ngood old tradition of marriage for better or worse holds inexorably for\r\nhim, and things work up to tragic culminations. Bricklayers kick their\r\nwives to death, and dukes betray theirs; but it is among the small\r\nclerks and shopkeepers nowadays that it comes most often to a cutting\r\nof throats. Under the circumstances it is not so very remarkable--and\r\nyou must take it as charitably as you can--that the mind of Mr. Coombes\r\nran for a while on some such glorious close to his disappointed hopes,\r\nand that he thought of razors, pistols, bread-knives, and touching\r\nletters to the coroner denouncing his enemies by name, and praying\r\npiously for forgiveness. After a time his fierceness gave way to\r\nmelancholia. He had been married in this very overcoat, in his first\r\nand only frock-coat that was buttoned up beneath it. He began to recall\r\ntheir courting along this very walk, his years of penurious saving to\r\nget capital, and the bright hopefulness of his marrying days. For it\r\nall to work out like this! Was there no sympathetic ruler anywhere in\r\nthe world? He reverted to death as a topic.\r\n\r\nHe thought of the canal he had just crossed, and doubted whether he\r\nshouldn't stand with his head out, even in the middle, and it was\r\nwhile drowning was in his mind that the purple pileus caught his eye.\r\nHe looked at it mechanically for a moment, and stopped and stooped\r\ntowards it to pick it up, under the impression that it was some such\r\nsmall leather object as a purse. Then he saw that it was the purple top\r\nof a fungus, a peculiarly poisonous-looking purple: slimy, shiny, and\r\nemitting a sour odour. He hesitated with his hand an inch or so from\r\nit, and the thought of poison crossed his mind. With that he picked the\r\nthing, and stood up again with it in his hand.\r\n\r\nThe odour was certainly strong--acrid, but by no means disgusting.\r\nHe broke off a piece, and the fresh surface was a creamy white, that\r\nchanged like magic in the space of ten seconds to a yellowish-green\r\ncolour. It was even an inviting-looking change. He broke off two other\r\npieces to see it repeated. They were wonderful things these fungi,\r\nthought Mr. Coombes, and all of them the deadliest poisons, as his\r\nfather had often told him. Deadly poisons!\r\n\r\nThere is no time like the present for a rash resolve. Why not here\r\nand now? thought Mr. Coombes. He tasted a little piece, a very little\r\npiece indeed--a mere crumb. It was so pungent that he almost spat\r\nit out again, then merely hot and full-flavoured. A kind of German\r\nmustard with a touch of horse-radish and--well, mushroom. He swallowed\r\nit in the excitement of the moment. Did he like it or did he not?\r\nHis mind was curiously careless. He would try another bit. It really\r\nwasn't bad--it was good. He forgot his troubles in the interest of\r\nthe immediate moment. Playing with death it was. He took another\r\nbite, and then deliberately finished a mouthful. A curious tingling\r\nsensation began in his finger-tips and toes. His pulse began to move\r\nfaster. The blood in his ears sounded like a mill-race. \"Try bi' more,\"\r\nsaid Mr. Coombes. He turned and looked about him, and found his feet\r\nunsteady. He saw and struggled towards a little patch of purple a dozen\r\nyards away. \"Jol' goo' stuff,\" said Mr. Coombes. \"E--lomore ye'.\" He\r\npitched forward and fell on his face, his hands outstretched towards\r\nthe cluster of pilei. But he did not eat any more of them. He forgot\r\nforthwith.\r\n\r\nHe rolled over and sat up with a look of astonishment on his face.\r\nHis carefully brushed silk hat had rolled away towards the ditch. He\r\npressed his hand to his brow. Something had happened, but he could\r\nnot rightly determine what it was. Anyhow, he was no longer dull--he\r\nfelt bright, cheerful. And his throat was afire. He laughed in the\r\nsudden gaiety of his heart. Had he been dull? He did not know; but at\r\nanyrate he would be dull no longer. He got up and stood unsteadily,\r\nregarding the universe with an agreeable smile. He began to remember.\r\nHe could not remember very well, because of a steam roundabout that\r\nwas beginning in his head. And he knew he had been disagreeable at\r\nhome, just because they wanted to be happy. They were quite right; life\r\nshould be as gay as possible. He would go home and make it up, and\r\nreassure them. And why not take some of this delightful toadstool with\r\nhim, for them to eat? A hatful, no less. Some of those red ones with\r\nwhite spots as well, and a few yellow. He had been a dull dog, an enemy\r\nto merriment; he would make up for it. It would be gay to turn his\r\ncoat-sleeves inside out, and stick some yellow gorse into his waistcoat\r\npockets. Then home--singing--for a jolly evening.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter the departure of Mr. Coombes, Jennie discontinued playing, and\r\nturned round on the music-stool again. \"What a fuss about nothing,\"\r\nsaid Jennie.\r\n\r\n\"You see, Mr. Clarence, what I've got to put up with,\" said Mrs.\r\nCoombes.\r\n\r\n\"He is a bit hasty,\" said Mr. Clarence judicially.\r\n\r\n\"He ain't got the slightest sense of our position,\" said Mrs. Coombes;\r\n\"that's what I complain of. He cares for nothing but his old shop; and\r\nif I have a bit of company, or buy anything to keep myself decent,\r\nor get any little thing I want out of the housekeeping money, there's\r\ndisagreeables. 'Economy,' he says; 'struggle for life,' and all that.\r\nHe lies awake of nights about it, worrying how he can screw me out of a\r\nshilling. He wanted us to eat Dorset butter once. If once I was to give\r\nin to him--there!\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" said Jennie.\r\n\r\n\"If a man values a woman,\" said Mr. Clarence lounging back in the\r\narm-chair, \"he must be prepared to make sacrifices for her. For my own\r\npart,\" said Mr. Clarence, with his eye on Jennie, \"I shouldn't think\r\nof marrying till I was in a position to do the thing in style. It's\r\ndownright selfishness. A man ought to go through the rough-and-tumble\r\nby himself, and not drag her\"--\r\n\r\n\"I don't agree altogether with that,\" said Jennie. \"I don't see why\r\na man shouldn't have a woman's help, provided he doesn't treat her\r\nmeanly, you know. It's meanness\"--\r\n\r\n\"You wouldn't believe,\" said Mrs. Coombes. \"But I was a fool to 'ave\r\n'im. I might 'ave known. If it 'adn't been for my father, we shouldn't\r\nhave had not a carriage to our wedding.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lord! he didn't stick out at that?\" said Mr. Clarence, quite shocked.\r\n\r\n\"Said he wanted the money for his stock, or some such rubbish. Why, he\r\nwouldn't have a woman in to help me once a week if it wasn't for my\r\nstanding out plucky. And the fusses he makes about money--comes to me,\r\nwell, pretty near crying, with sheets of paper and figgers. 'If only we\r\ncan tide over this year,' he says, 'the business is bound to go.' 'If\r\nonly we can tide over this year,' I says; 'then it'll be, if only we\r\ncan tide over next year. I know you,' I says. 'And you don't catch me\r\nscrewing myself lean and ugly. Why didn't you marry a slavey?' I says,\r\n'if you wanted one--instead of a respectable girl,' I says.\"\r\n\r\nSo Mrs. Coombes. But we will not follow this unedifying conversation\r\nfurther. Suffice it that Mr. Coombes was very satisfactorily disposed\r\nof, and they had a snug little time round the fire. Then Mrs. Coombes\r\nwent to get the tea, and Jennie sat coquettishly on the arm of Mr.\r\nClarence's chair until the tea-things clattered outside. \"What was\r\nthat I heard?\" asked Mrs. Coombes playfully, as she entered, and there\r\nwas badinage about kissing. They were just sitting down to the little\r\ncircular table when the first intimation of Mr. Coombes' return was\r\nheard.\r\n\r\nThis was a fumbling at the latch of the front door.\r\n\r\n\"'Ere's my lord,\" said Mrs. Coombes. \"Went out like a lion and comes\r\nback like a lamb, I'll lay.\"\r\n\r\nSomething fell over in the shop: a chair, it sounded like. Then there\r\nwas a sound as of some complicated step exercise in the passage. Then\r\nthe door opened and Coombes appeared. But it was Coombes transfigured.\r\nThe immaculate collar had been torn carelessly from his throat. His\r\ncarefully-brushed silk hat, half-full of a crush of fungi, was under\r\none arm; his coat was inside out, and his waistcoat adorned with\r\nbunches of yellow-blossomed furze. These little eccentricities of\r\nSunday costume, however, were quite overshadowed by the change in his\r\nface; it was livid white, his eyes were unnaturally large and bright,\r\nand his pale blue lips were drawn back in a cheerless grin. \"Merry!\"\r\nhe said. He had stopped dancing to open the door. \"Rational 'njoyment.\r\nDance.\" He made three fantastic steps into the room, and stood bowing.\r\n\r\n\"Jim!\" shrieked Mrs. Coombes, and Mr. Clarence sat petrified, with a\r\ndropping lower jaw.\r\n\r\n\"Tea,\" said Mr. Coombes. \"Jol' thing, tea. Tose-stools, too. Brosher.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's drunk,\" said Jennie in a weak voice. Never before had she seen\r\nthis intense pallor in a drunken man, or such shining, dilated eyes.\r\n\r\nMr. Coombes held out a handful of scarlet agaric to Mr. Clarence. \"Jo'\r\nstuff,\" said he; \"ta' some.\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment he was genial. Then at the sight of their startled faces\r\nhe changed, with the swift transition of insanity, into overbearing\r\nfury. And it seemed as if he had suddenly recalled the quarrel of his\r\ndeparture. In such a huge voice as Mrs. Coombes had never heard before,\r\nhe shouted, \"My house. I'm master 'ere. Eat what I give yer!\" He bawled\r\nthis, as it seemed, without an effort, without a violent gesture,\r\nstanding there as motionless as one who whispers, holding out a handful\r\nof fungus.\r\n\r\nClarence approved himself a coward. He could not meet the mad fury in\r\nCoombes' eyes; he rose to his feet, pushing back his chair, and turned,\r\nstooping. At that Coombes rushed at him. Jennie saw her opportunity,\r\nand, with the ghost of a shriek, made for the door. Mrs. Coombes\r\nfollowed her. Clarence tried to dodge. Over went the tea-table with a\r\nsmash as Coombes clutched him by the collar and tried to thrust the\r\nfungus into his mouth. Clarence was content to leave his collar behind\r\nhim, and shot out into the passage with red patches of fly agaric still\r\nadherent to his face. \"Shut 'im in!\" cried Mrs. Coombes, and would have\r\nclosed the door, but her supports deserted her; Jennie saw the shop\r\ndoor open, and vanished thereby, locking it behind her, while Clarence\r\nwent on hastily into the kitchen. Mr. Coombes came heavily against the\r\ndoor, and Mrs. Coombes, finding the key was inside, fled upstairs and\r\nlocked herself in the spare bedroom.\r\n\r\nSo the new convert to _joie de vivre_ emerged upon the passage, his\r\ndecorations a little scattered, but that respectable hatful of fungi\r\nstill under his arm. He hesitated at the three ways, and decided on the\r\nkitchen. Whereupon Clarence, who was fumbling with the key, gave up\r\nthe attempt to imprison his host, and fled into the scullery, only to\r\nbe captured before he could open the door into the yard. Mr. Clarence\r\nis singularly reticent of the details of what occurred. It seems that\r\nMr. Coombes' transitory irritation had vanished again, and he was once\r\nmore a genial playfellow. And as there were knives and meat choppers\r\nabout, Clarence very generously resolved to humour him and so avoid\r\nanything tragic. It is beyond dispute that Mr. Coombes played with Mr.\r\nClarence to his heart's content; they could not have been more playful\r\nand familiar if they had known each other for years. He insisted gaily\r\non Clarence trying the fungi, and after a friendly tussle, was smitten\r\nwith remorse at the mess he was making of his guest's face. It also\r\nappears that Clarence was dragged under the sink and his face scrubbed\r\nwith the blacking brush,--he being still resolved to humour the lunatic\r\nat any cost,--and that finally, in a somewhat dishevelled, chipped, and\r\ndiscoloured condition, he was assisted to his coat and shown out by the\r\nback door, the shopway being barred by Jennie. Mr. Coombes' wandering\r\nthoughts then turned to Jennie. Jennie had been unable to unfasten the\r\nshop door, but she shot the bolts against Mr. Coombes' latch-key, and\r\nremained in possession of the shop for the rest of the evening.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that Mr. Coombes then returned to the kitchen, still\r\nin pursuit of gaiety, and, albeit a strict Good Templar, drank (or\r\nspilt down the front of the first and only frock-coat) no less than\r\nfive bottles of the stout Mrs. Coombes insisted upon having for her\r\nhealth's sake. He made cheerful noises by breaking off the necks of\r\nthe bottles with several of his wife's wedding-present dinner-plates,\r\nand during the earlier part of this great drunk he sang divers merry\r\nballads. He cut his finger rather badly with one of the bottles,--the\r\nonly bloodshed in this story,--and what with that, and the systematic\r\nconvulsion of his inexperienced physiology by the liquorish brand\r\nof Mrs. Coombes' stout, it may be the evil of the fungus poison was\r\nsomehow allayed. But we prefer to draw a veil over the concluding\r\nincidents of this Sunday afternoon. They ended in the coal cellar, in a\r\ndeep and healing sleep.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn interval of five years elapsed. Again it was a Sunday afternoon\r\nin October, and again Mr. Coombes walked through the pinewood beyond\r\nthe canal. He was still the same dark-eyed, black-moustached little\r\nman that he was at the outset of the story, but his double chin was\r\nnow scarcely so illusory as it had been. His overcoat was new, with a\r\nvelvet lapel, and a stylish collar with turn-down corners, free of any\r\ncoarse starchiness, had replaced the original all-round article. His\r\nhat was glossy, his gloves newish--though one finger had split and been\r\ncarefully mended. And a casual observer would have noticed about him a\r\ncertain rectitude of bearing, a certain erectness of head that marks\r\nthe man who thinks well of himself. He was a master now, with three\r\nassistants. Beside him walked a larger sunburnt parody of himself, his\r\nbrother Tom, just back from Australia. They were recapitulating their\r\nearly struggles, and Mr. Coombes had just been making a financial\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\n\"It's a very nice little business, Jim,\" said brother Tom. \"In these\r\ndays of competition you're jolly lucky to have worked it up so. And\r\nyou're jolly lucky, too, to have a wife who's willing to help like\r\nyours does.\"\r\n\r\n\"Between ourselves,\" said Mr. Coombes, \"it wasn't always so. It wasn't\r\nalways like this. To begin with, the missus was a bit giddy. Girls are\r\nfunny creatures.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. You'd hardly think it, but she was downright extravagant, and\r\nalways having slaps at me. I was a bit too easy and loving, and all\r\nthat, and she thought the whole blessed show was run for her. Turned\r\nthe 'ouse into a regular caravansery, always having her relations and\r\ngirls from business in, and their chaps. Comic songs a' Sunday, it was\r\ngetting to, and driving trade away. And she was making eyes at the\r\nchaps, too! I tell you, Tom, the place wasn't my own.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shouldn't 'a' thought it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was so. Well--I reasoned with her. I said, 'I ain't a duke, to keep\r\na wife like a pet animal. I married you for 'elp and company.' I said,\r\n'You got to 'elp and pull the business through.' She wouldn't 'ear of\r\nit. 'Very well,' I says; 'I'm a mild man till I'm roused,' I says, 'and\r\nit's getting to that.' But she wouldn't 'ear of no warnings.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's the way with women. She didn't think I 'ad it in me to be roused.\r\nWomen of her sort (between ourselves, Tom) don't respect a man until\r\nthey're a bit afraid of him. So I just broke out to show her. In comes\r\na girl named Jennie, that used to work with her, and her chap. We 'ad\r\na bit of a row, and I came out 'ere--it was just such another day as\r\nthis--and I thought it all out. Then I went back and pitched into them.\"\r\n\r\n\"You did?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did. I was mad, I can tell you. I wasn't going to 'it 'er, if I\r\ncould 'elp it, so I went back and licked into this chap, just to show\r\n'er what I could do. 'E was a big chap, too. Well, I chucked him, and\r\nsmashed things about, and gave 'er a scaring, and she ran up and locked\r\n'erself into the spare room.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all. I says to 'er the next morning, 'Now you know,' I says,\r\n'what I'm like when I'm roused.' And I didn't 'ave to say anything\r\nmore.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you've been happy ever after, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"So to speak. There's nothing like putting your foot down with them. If\r\nit 'adn't been for that afternoon I should 'a' been tramping the roads\r\nnow, and she'd 'a' been grumbling at me, and all her family grumbling\r\nfor bringing her to poverty--I know their little ways. But we're all\r\nright now. And it's a very decent little business, as you say.\"\r\n\r\nThey proceed on their way meditatively. \"Women are funny creatures,\"\r\nsaid brother Tom.\r\n\r\n\"They want a firm hand,\" says Coombes.\r\n\r\n\"What a lot of these funguses there are about here!\" remarked brother\r\nTom presently. \"I can't see what use they are in the world.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Coombes looked. \"I dessay they're sent for some wise purpose,\" said\r\nMr. Coombes.\r\n\r\nAnd that was as much thanks as the purple pileus ever got for maddening\r\nthis absurd little man to the pitch of decisive action, and so altering\r\nthe whole course of his life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JILTING OF JANE\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I sit writing in my study, I can hear our Jane bumping her way\r\ndownstairs with a brush and dustpan. She used in the old days to sing\r\nhymn tunes, or the British national song for the time being, to these\r\ninstruments, but latterly she has been silent and even careful over\r\nher work. Time was when I prayed with fervour for such silence, and\r\nmy wife with sighs for such care, but now they have come we are not\r\nso glad as we might have anticipated we should be. Indeed, I would\r\nrejoice secretly, though it may be unmanly weakness to admit it, even\r\nto hear Jane sing \"Daisy,\" or by the fracture of any plate but one of\r\nEuphemia's best green ones, to learn that the period of brooding has\r\ncome to an end.\r\n\r\nYet how we longed to hear the last of Jane's young man before we heard\r\nthe last of him! Jane was always very free with her conversation to\r\nmy wife, and discoursed admirably in the kitchen on a variety of\r\ntopics--so well, indeed, that I sometimes left my study door open--our\r\nhouse is a small one--to partake of it. But after William came, it was\r\nalways William, nothing but William; William this and William that;\r\nand when we thought William was worked out and exhausted altogether,\r\nthen William all over again. The engagement lasted altogether three\r\nyears; yet how she got introduced to William, and so became thus\r\nsaturated with him, was always a secret. For my part, I believe it\r\nwas at the street corner where the Rev. Barnabas Baux used to hold an\r\nopen-air service after evensong on Sundays. Young Cupids were wont to\r\nflit like moths round the paraffin flare of that centre of High Church\r\nhymn-singing. I fancy she stood singing hymns there, out of memory and\r\nher imagination, instead of coming home to get supper, and William\r\ncame up beside her and said, \"Hello!\" \"Hello yourself!\" she said; and,\r\netiquette being satisfied, they proceeded to talk together.\r\n\r\nAs Euphemia has a reprehensible way of letting her servants talk to\r\nher, she soon heard of him. \"He is _such_ a respectable young man,\r\nma'am,\" said Jane, \"you don't know.\" Ignoring the slur cast on her\r\nacquaintance, my wife inquired further about this William.\r\n\r\n\"He is second porter at Maynard's, the draper's,\" said Jane, \"and\r\ngets eighteen shillings--nearly a pound--a week, m'm; and when the\r\nhead porter leaves he will be head porter. His relatives are quite\r\nsuperior people, m'm. Not labouring people at all. His father was a\r\ngreengrosher, m'm, and had a chumor, and he was bankrup' twice. And one\r\nof his sisters is in a Home for the Dying. It will be a very good match\r\nfor me, m'm,\" said Jane, \"me being an orphan girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you are engaged to him?\" asked my wife.\r\n\r\n\"Not engaged, ma'am; but he is saving money to buy a ring--hammyfist.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Jane, when you are properly engaged to him you may ask him round\r\nhere on Sunday afternoons, and have tea with him in the kitchen.\"\r\nFor my Euphemia has a motherly conception of her duty towards her\r\nmaid-servants. And presently the amethystine ring was being worn about\r\nthe house, even with ostentation, and Jane developed a new way of\r\nbringing in the joint, so that this gage was evident. The elder Miss\r\nMaitland was aggrieved by it, and told my wife that servants ought not\r\nto wear rings. But my wife looked it up in _Enquire Within_ and _Mrs.\r\nMotherly's Book of Household Management_, and found no prohibition. So\r\nJane remained with this happiness added to her love.\r\n\r\nThe treasure of Jane's heart appeared to me to be what respectable\r\npeople call a very deserving young man. \"William, ma'am,\" said Jane one\r\nday suddenly, with ill-concealed complacency, as she counted out the\r\nbeer bottles, \"William, ma'am, is a teetotaller. Yes, m'm; and he don't\r\nsmoke. Smoking, ma'am,\" said Jane, as one who reads the heart, \"_do_\r\nmake such a dust about. Beside the waste of money. _And_ the smell.\r\nHowever, I suppose it's necessary to some.\"\r\n\r\nPossibly it dawned on Jane that she was reflecting a little severely\r\nupon Euphemia's comparative ill-fortune, and she added kindly, \"I'm\r\nsure the master is a hangel when his pipe's alight. Compared to other\r\ntimes.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam was at first a rather shabby young man of the ready-made black\r\ncoat school of costume. He had watery grey eyes, and a complexion\r\nappropriate to the brother of one in a Home for the Dying. Euphemia\r\ndid not fancy him very much, even at the beginning. His eminent\r\nrespectability was vouched for by an alpaca umbrella, from which he\r\nnever allowed himself to be parted.\r\n\r\n\"He goes to chapel,\" said Jane. \"His papa, ma'am\"--\r\n\r\n\"His _what_, Jane?\"\r\n\r\n\"His papa, ma'am, was Church; but Mr. Maynard is a Plymouth Brother,\r\nand William thinks it Policy, ma'am, to go there too. Mr. Maynard comes\r\nand talks to him quite friendly, when they ain't busy, about using up\r\nall the ends of string, and about his soul. He takes a lot of notice,\r\ndo Mr. Maynard, of William, and the way he saves string and his soul,\r\nma'am.\"\r\n\r\nPresently we heard that the head porter at Maynard's had left, and that\r\nWilliam was head porter at twenty-three shillings a week. \"He is really\r\nkind of over the man who drives the van,\" said Jane, \"and him married\r\nwith three children.\" And she promised in the pride of her heart to\r\nmake interest for us with William to favour us so that we might get our\r\nparcels of drapery from Maynard's with exceptional promptitude.\r\n\r\nAfter this promotion a rapidly increasing prosperity came upon Jane's\r\nyoung man. One day, we learned that Mr. Maynard had given William a\r\nbook. \"Smiles' Elp Yourself, it's called,\" said Jane; \"but it ain't\r\ncomic. It tells you how to get on in the world, and some what William\r\nread to me was _lovely_, ma'am.\"\r\n\r\nEuphemia told me of this laughing, and then she became suddenly grave.\r\n\"Do you know, dear,\" she said, \"Jane said one thing I did not like. She\r\nhad been quiet for a minute, and then she suddenly remarked, 'William\r\nis a lot above me, ma'am, ain't he?'\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see anything in that,\" I said, though later my eyes were to be\r\nopened.\r\n\r\nOne Sunday afternoon about that time I was sitting at my\r\nwriting-desk--possibly I was reading a good book--when a something\r\nwent by the window. I heard a startled exclamation behind me, and\r\nsaw Euphemia with her hands clasped together and her eyes dilated.\r\n\"George,\" she said in an awestricken whisper, \"did you see?\"\r\n\r\nThen we both spoke to one another at the same moment, slowly and\r\nsolemnly: \"_A silk hat! Yellow gloves! A new umbrella!_\"\r\n\r\n\"It may be my fancy, dear,\" said Euphemia; \"but his tie was very like\r\nyours. I believe Jane keeps him in ties. She told me a little while\r\nago in a way that implied volumes about the rest of your costume, 'The\r\nmaster _do_ wear pretty ties, ma'am.' And he echoes all your novelties.\"\r\n\r\nThe young couple passed our window again on their way to their\r\ncustomary walk. They were arm in arm. Jane looked exquisitely proud,\r\nhappy, and uncomfortable, with new white cotton gloves, and William, in\r\nthe silk hat, singularly genteel!\r\n\r\nThat was the culmination of Jane's happiness. When she returned, \"Mr.\r\nMaynard has been talking to William, ma'am,\" she said, \"and he is to\r\nserve customers, just like the young shop gentlemen, during the next\r\nsale. And if he gets on, he is to be made an assistant, ma'am, at the\r\nfirst opportunity. He has got to be as gentlemanly as he can, ma'am;\r\nand if he ain't, ma'am, he says it won't be for want of trying. Mr.\r\nMaynard has took a great fancy to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"He _is_ getting on, Jane,\" said my wife.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" said Jane thoughtfully, \"he _is_ getting on.\"\r\n\r\nAnd she sighed.\r\n\r\nThat next Sunday, as I drank my tea, I interrogated my wife. \"How is\r\nthis Sunday different from all other Sundays, little woman? What has\r\nhappened? Have you altered the curtains, or rearranged the furniture,\r\nor where is the indefinable difference of it? Are you wearing your hair\r\nin a new way without warning me? I clearly perceive a change in my\r\nenvironment, and I cannot for the life of me say what it is.\"\r\n\r\nThen my wife answered in her most tragic voice: \"George,\" she said,\r\n\"that--that William has not come near the place to-day! And Jane is\r\ncrying her heart out upstairs.\"\r\n\r\nThere followed a period of silence. Jane, as I have said, stopped\r\nsinging about the house, and began to care for our brittle possessions,\r\nwhich struck my wife as being a very sad sign indeed. The next Sunday,\r\nand the next, Jane asked to go out, \"to walk with William,\" and my\r\nwife, who never attempts to extort confidences, gave her permission,\r\nand asked no questions. On each occasion Jane came back looking\r\nflushed and very determined. At last one day she became communicative.\r\n\r\n\"William is being led away,\" she remarked abruptly, with a catching of\r\nthe breath, apropos of tablecloths. \"Yes, m'm. She is a milliner, and\r\nshe can play on the piano.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought,\" said my wife, \"that you went out with him on Sunday.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not out with him, m'm--after him. I walked along by the side of them,\r\nand told her he was engaged to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear me, Jane, did you? What did they do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Took no more notice of me than if I was dirt. So I told her she should\r\nsuffer for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It could not have been a very agreeable walk, Jane.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not for no parties, ma'am.\r\n\r\n\"I wish,\" said Jane, \"I could play the piano, ma'am. But anyhow, I\r\ndon't mean to let _her_ get him away from me. She's older than him, and\r\nher hair ain't gold to the roots, ma'am.\"\r\n\r\nIt was on the August Bank Holiday that the crisis came. We do not\r\nclearly know the details of the fray, but only such fragments as poor\r\nJane let fall. She came home dusty, excited, and with her heart hot\r\nwithin her.\r\n\r\nThe milliner's mother, the milliner, and William had made a party to\r\nthe Art Museum at South Kensington, I think. Anyhow, Jane had calmly\r\nbut firmly accosted them somewhere in the streets, and asserted her\r\nright to what, in spite of the consensus of literature, she held to\r\nbe her inalienable property. She did, I think, go so far as to lay\r\nhands on him. They dealt with her in a crushingly superior way. They\r\n\"called a cab.\" There was a \"scene,\" William being pulled away into the\r\nfour-wheeler by his future wife and mother-in-law from the reluctant\r\nhands of our discarded Jane. There were threats of giving her \"in\r\ncharge.\"\r\n\r\n\"My poor Jane!\" said my wife, mincing veal as though she was mincing\r\nWilliam. \"It's a shame of them. I would think no more of him. He is not\r\nworthy of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, m'm,\" said Jane. \"He _is_ weak.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it's that woman has done it,\" said Jane. She was never known\r\nto bring herself to pronounce \"that woman's\" name or to admit her\r\ngirlishness. \"I can't think what minds some women must have--to try and\r\nget a girl's young man away from her. But there, it only hurts to talk\r\nabout it,\" said Jane.\r\n\r\nThereafter our house rested from William. But there was something in\r\nthe manner of Jane's scrubbing the front doorstep or sweeping out the\r\nrooms, a certain viciousness, that persuaded me that the story had not\r\nyet ended.\r\n\r\n\"Please, m'm, may I go and see a wedding to-morrow?\" said Jane one day.\r\n\r\nMy wife knew by instinct whose wedding. \"Do you think it is wise,\r\nJane?\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"I would like to see the last of him,\" said Jane.\r\n\r\n\"My dear,\" said my wife, fluttering into my room about twenty minutes\r\nafter Jane had started, \"Jane has been to the boot-hole and taken all\r\nthe left-off boots and shoes, and gone off to the wedding with them in\r\na bag. Surely she cannot mean\"--\r\n\r\n\"Jane,\" I said, \"is developing character. Let us hope for the best.\"\r\n\r\nJane came back with a pale, hard face. All the boots seemed to be still\r\nin her bag, at which my wife heaved a premature sigh of relief. We\r\nheard her go upstairs and replace the boots with considerable emphasis.\r\n\r\n\"Quite a crowd at the wedding, ma'am,\" she said presently, in a purely\r\nconversational style, sitting in our little kitchen, and scrubbing the\r\npotatoes; \"and such a lovely day for them.\" She proceeded to numerous\r\nother details, clearly avoiding some cardinal incident.\r\n\r\n\"It was all extremely respectable and nice, ma'am; but _her_ father\r\ndidn't wear a black coat, and looked quite out of place, ma'am. Mr.\r\nPiddingquirk\"--\r\n\r\n\"_Who?_\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Piddingquirk--William that _was_, ma'am--had white gloves, and\r\na coat like a clergyman, and a lovely chrysanthemum. He looked so\r\nnice, ma'am. And there was red carpet down, just like for gentlefolks.\r\nAnd they say he gave the clerk four shillings, ma'am. It was a real\r\nkerridge they had--not a fly. When they came out of church there was\r\nrice-throwing, and her two little sisters dropping dead flowers. And\r\nsomeone threw a slipper, and then I threw a boot\"--\r\n\r\n\"Threw a _boot_, Jane!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, ma'am. Aimed at _her_. But it hit _him_. Yes, ma'am, hard. Gev\r\nhim a black eye, I should think. I only threw that one. I hadn't the\r\nheart to try again. All the little boys cheered when it hit him.\"\r\n\r\nAfter an interval--\"I am sorry the boot hit _him_.\"\r\n\r\nAnother pause. The potatoes were being scrubbed violently. \"He always\r\n_was_ a bit above me, you know, ma'am. And he was led away.\"\r\n\r\nThe potatoes were more than finished. Jane rose sharply, with a sigh,\r\nand rapped the basin down on the table.\r\n\r\n\"I don't care,\" she said. \"I don't care a rap. He will find out his\r\nmistake yet. It serves me right. I was stuck up about him. I ought not\r\nto have looked so high. And I am glad things are as things are.\"\r\n\r\nMy wife was in the kitchen, seeing to the higher cookery. After the\r\nconfession of the boot-throwing, she must have watched poor Jane fuming\r\nwith a certain dismay in those brown eyes of hers. But I imagine they\r\nsoftened again very quickly, and then Jane's must have met them.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, ma'am,\" said Jane, with an astonishing change of note, \"think\r\nof all that _might_ have been! Oh, ma'am, I _could_ have been so\r\nhappy! I ought to have known, but I didn't know.... You're very kind\r\nto let me talk to you, ma'am ... for it's hard on me, ma'am ... it's\r\nhar-r-r-r-d\"--\r\n\r\nAnd I gather that Euphemia so far forgot herself as to let Jane sob\r\nout some of the fulness of her heart on a sympathetic shoulder. My\r\nEuphemia, thank Heaven, has never properly grasped the importance of\r\n\"keeping up her position.\" And since that fit of weeping, much of the\r\naccent of bitterness has gone out of Jane's scrubbing and brush work.\r\n\r\nIndeed, something passed the other day with the butcher-boy--but that\r\nscarcely belongs to this story. However, Jane is young still, and time\r\nand change are at work with her. We all have our sorrows, but I do not\r\nbelieve very much in the existence of sorrows that never heal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE MODERN VEIN\r\n\r\nAN UNSYMPATHETIC LOVE STORY\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course the cultivated reader has heard of Aubrey Vair. He has\r\npublished on three several occasions volumes of delicate verses,--some,\r\nindeed, border on indelicacy,--and his column \"Of Things Literary\" in\r\nthe _Climax_ is well known. His Byronic visage and an interview have\r\nappeared in the _Perfect Lady_. It was Aubrey Vair, I believe, who\r\ndemonstrated that the humour of Dickens was worse than his sentiment,\r\nand who detected \"a subtle bourgeois flavour\" in Shakespeare. However,\r\nit is not generally known that Aubrey Vair has had erotic experiences\r\nas well as erotic inspirations. He adopted Goethe some little time\r\nsince as his literary prototype, and that may have had something to do\r\nwith his temporary lapse from sexual integrity.\r\n\r\nFor it is one of the commonest things that undermine literary men,\r\ngiving us landslips and picturesque effects along the otherwise even\r\ncliff of their respectable life, ranking next to avarice, and certainly\r\nabove drink, this instability called genius, or, more fully, the\r\nconsciousness of genius, such as Aubrey Vair possessed. Since Shelley\r\nset the fashion, your man of gifts has been assured that his duty to\r\nhimself and his duty to his wife are incompatible, and his renunciation\r\nof the Philistine has been marked by such infidelity as his means and\r\ncourage warranted. Most virtue is lack of imagination. At anyrate,\r\na minor genius without his affections twisted into an inextricable\r\nmuddle, and who did not occasionally shed sonnets over his troubles, I\r\nhave never met.\r\n\r\nEven Aubrey Vair did this, weeping the sonnets overnight into his\r\nblotting-book, and pretending to write literary _causerie_ when his\r\nwife came down in her bath slippers to see what kept him up. She did\r\nnot understand him, of course. He did this even before the other woman\r\nappeared, so ingrained is conjugal treachery in the talented mind.\r\nIndeed, he wrote more sonnets before the other woman came than after\r\nthat event, because thereafter he spent much of his leisure in cutting\r\ndown the old productions, retrimming them, and generally altering this\r\nreadymade clothing of his passion to suit her particular height and\r\ncomplexion.\r\n\r\nAubrey Vair lived in a little red villa with a lawn at the back and a\r\nview of the Downs behind Reigate. He lived upon discreet investment\r\neked out by literary work. His wife was handsome, sweet, and gentle,\r\nand--such is the tender humility of good married women--she found her\r\nlife's happiness in seeing that little Aubrey Vair had well-cooked\r\nvariety for dinner, and that their house was the neatest and brightest\r\nof all the houses they entered. Aubrey Vair enjoyed the dinners, and\r\nwas proud of the house, yet nevertheless he mourned because his genius\r\ndwindled. Moreover, he grew plump, and corpulence threatened him.\r\n\r\nWe learn in suffering what we teach in song, and Aubrey Vair knew\r\ncertainly that his soul could give no creditable crops unless his\r\naffections were harrowed. And how to harrow them was the trouble, for\r\nReigate is a moral neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nSo Aubrey Vair's romantic longings blew loose for a time, much as a\r\nseedling creeper might, planted in the midst of a flower-bed. But at\r\nlast, in the fulness of time, the other woman came to the embrace\r\nof Aubrey Vair's yearning heart-tendrils, and his romantic episode\r\nproceeded as is here faithfully written down.\r\n\r\nThe other woman was really a girl, and Aubrey Vair met her first at\r\na tennis party at Redhill. Aubrey Vair did not play tennis after the\r\naccident to Miss Morton's eye, and because latterly it made him pant\r\nand get warmer and moister than even a poet should be; and this young\r\nlady had only recently arrived in England, and could not play. So they\r\ngravitated into the two vacant basket chairs beside Mrs. Bayne's deaf\r\naunt, in front of the hollyhocks, and were presently talking at their\r\nease together.\r\n\r\nThe other woman's name was unpropitious,--Miss Smith,--but you would\r\nnever have suspected it from her face and costume. Her parentage\r\nwas promising, she was an orphan, her mother was a Hindoo, and her\r\nfather an Indian civil servant; and Aubrey Vair--himself a happy\r\nmixture of Kelt and Teuton, as, indeed, all literary men have to be\r\nnowadays--naturally believed in the literary consequences of a mixture\r\nof races. She was dressed in white. She had finely moulded pale\r\nfeatures, great depth of expression, and a cloud of delicately _frisé_\r\nblack hair over her dark eyes, and she looked at Aubrey Vair with a\r\nlook half curious and half shy, that contrasted admirably with the\r\nstereotyped frankness of your common Reigate girl.\r\n\r\n\"This is a splendid lawn--the best in Redhill,\" said Aubrey Vair in the\r\ncourse of the conversation; \"and I like it all the better because the\r\ndaisies are spared.\" He indicated the daisies with a graceful sweep of\r\nhis rather elegant hand.\r\n\r\n\"They are sweet little flowers,\" said the lady in white, \"and I have\r\nalways associated them with England, chiefly, perhaps, through a\r\npicture I saw 'over there' when I was very little, of children making\r\ndaisy chains. I promised myself that pleasure when I came home. But,\r\nalas! I feel now rather too large for such delights.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not see why we should not be able to enjoy these simple pleasures\r\nas we grow older--why our growth should have in it so much forgetting.\r\nFor my own part\"--\r\n\r\n\"Has your wife got Jane's recipe for stuffing trout?\" asked Mrs.\r\nBayne's deaf aunt abruptly.\r\n\r\n\"I really don't know,\" said Aubrey Vair.\r\n\r\n\"That's all right,\" said Mrs. Bayne's deaf aunt. \"It ought to please\r\neven you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Anything will please me,\" said Aubrey Vair; \"I care very little\"--\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's a lovely dish,\" said Mrs. Bayne's deaf aunt, and relapsed\r\ninto contemplation.\r\n\r\n\"I was saying,\" said Aubrey Vair, \"that I think I still find my keenest\r\npleasures in childish pastimes. I have a little nephew that I see a\r\ngreat deal of, and when we fly kites together, I am sure it would be\r\nhard to tell which of us is the happier. By the bye, you should get at\r\nyour daisy chains in that way. Beguile some little girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I did. I took that Morton mite for a walk in the meadows, and\r\ntimidly broached the subject. And she reproached me for suggesting\r\n'frivolous pursuits.' It was a horrible disappointment.\"\r\n\r\n\"The governess here,\" said Aubrey Vair, \"is robbing that child of its\r\nyouth in a terrible way. What will a life be that has no childhood at\r\nthe beginning?\"\r\n\r\n\"Some human beings are never young,\" he continued, \"and they never\r\ngrow up. They lead absolutely colourless lives. They are--they are\r\netiolated. They never love, and never feel the loss of it. They\r\nare--for the moment I can think of no better image--they are human\r\nflower-pots, in which no soul has been planted. But a human soul\r\nproperly growing must begin in a fresh childishness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the dark lady thoughtfully, \"a careless childhood, running\r\nwild almost. That should be the beginning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we pass through the wonder and diffidence of youth.\"\r\n\r\n\"To strength and action,\" said the dark lady. Her dreamy eyes were\r\nfixed on the Downs, and her fingers tightened on her knees as she\r\nspoke. \"Ah, it is a grand thing to live--as a man does--self-reliant\r\nand free.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so at last,\" said Aubrey Vair, \"come to the culmination and crown\r\nof life.\" He paused and glanced hastily at her. Then he dropped his\r\nvoice almost to a whisper--\"And the culmination of life is love.\"\r\n\r\nTheir eyes met for a moment, but she looked away at once. Aubrey Vair\r\nfelt a peculiar thrill and a catching in his breath, but his emotions\r\nwere too complex for analysis. He had a certain sense of surprise,\r\nalso, at the way his conversation had developed.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bayne's deaf aunt suddenly dug him in the chest with her\r\near-trumpet, and someone at tennis bawled, \"Love all!\"\r\n\r\n\"Did I tell you Jane's girls have had scarlet fever?\" asked Mrs.\r\nBayne's deaf aunt.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Aubrey Vair.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; and they are peeling now,\" said Mrs. Bayne's deaf aunt, shutting\r\nher lips tightly, and nodding in a slow, significant manner at both of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. All three seemed lost in thought, too deep for words.\r\n\r\n\"Love,\" began Aubrey Vair presently, in a severely philosophical tone,\r\nleaning back in his chair, holding his hands like a praying saint's\r\nin front of him, and staring at the toe of his shoe,--\"love is, I\r\nbelieve, the one true and real thing in life. It rises above reason,\r\ninterest, or explanation. Yet I never read of an age when it was so\r\nmuch forgotten as it is now. Never was love expected to run so much in\r\nappointed channels, never was it so despised, checked, ordered, and\r\nobstructed. Policemen say, 'This way, Eros!' As a result, we relieve\r\nour emotional possibilities in the hunt for gold and notoriety. And\r\nafter all, with the best fortune in these, we only hold up the gilded\r\nimages of our success, and are weary slaves, with unsatisfied hearts,\r\nin the pageant of life.\"\r\n\r\nAubrey Vair sighed, and there was a pause. The girl looked at him out\r\nof the mysterious darkness of her eyes. She had read many books, but\r\nAubrey Vair was her first literary man, and she took this kind of thing\r\nfor genius--as girls have done before.\r\n\r\n\"We are,\" continued Aubrey Vair, conscious of a favourable\r\nimpression,--\"we are like fireworks, mere dead, inert things until the\r\nappointed spark comes; and then--if it is not damp--the dormant soul\r\nblazes forth in all its warmth and beauty. That is living. I sometimes\r\nthink, do you know, that we should be happier if we could die soon\r\nafter that golden time, like the Ephemerides. There is a decay sets in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eigh?\" said Mrs. Bayne's deaf aunt startlingly. \"I didn't hear you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was on the point of remarking,\" shouted Aubrey Vair, wheeling the\r\narray of his thoughts,--\"I was on the point of remarking that few\r\npeople in Redhill could match Mrs. Morton's fine broad green.\"\r\n\r\n\"Others have noticed it,\" Mrs. Bayne's deaf aunt shouted back. \"It is\r\nsince she has had in her new false teeth.\"\r\n\r\nThis interruption dislocated the conversation a little. However--\r\n\r\n\"I must thank you, Mr. Vair,\" said the dark girl, when they parted that\r\nafternoon, \"for having given me very much to think about.\"\r\n\r\nAnd from her manner, Aubrey Vair perceived clearly he had not wasted\r\nhis time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt would require a subtler pen than mine to tell how from that day a\r\npassion for Miss Smith grew like Jonah's gourd in the heart of Aubrey\r\nVair. He became pensive, and in the prolonged absence of Miss Smith,\r\nirritable. Mrs. Aubrey Vair felt the change in him, and put it down\r\nto a vitriolic Saturday Reviewer. Indisputably the _Saturday_ does at\r\ntimes go a little far. He re-read _Elective Affinities_; and lent it\r\nto Miss Smith. Incredible as it may appear to members of the Areopagus\r\nClub, where we know Aubrey Vair, he did also beyond all question\r\ninspire a sort of passion in that sombre-eyed, rather clever, and\r\nreally very beautiful girl.\r\n\r\nHe talked to her a lot about love and destiny, and all that bric-à-brac\r\nof the minor poet. And they talked together about his genius. He\r\nelaborately, though discreetly, sought her society, and presented\r\nand read to her the milder of his unpublished sonnets. We consider\r\nhis Byronic features pasty, but the feminine mind has its own laws.\r\nI suppose, also, where a girl is not a fool, a literary man has an\r\nenormous advantage over anyone but a preacher, in the show he can make\r\nof his heart's wares.\r\n\r\nAt last a day in that summer came when he met her alone, possibly by\r\nchance, in a quiet lane towards Horley. There were ample hedges on\r\neither side, rich with honeysuckle, vetch, and mullein.\r\n\r\nThey conversed intimately of his poetic ambitions, and then he read\r\nher those verses of his subsequently published in _Hobson's Magazine_:\r\n\"Tenderly ever, since I have met thee.\" He had written these the day\r\nbefore; and though I think the sentiment is uncommonly trite, there is\r\na redeeming note of sincerity about the lines not conspicuous in all\r\nAubrey Vair's poetry.\r\n\r\nHe read rather well, and a swell of genuine emotion crept into his\r\nvoice as he read, with one white hand thrown out to point the rhythm of\r\nthe lines. \"Ever, my sweet, for thee,\" he concluded, looking up into\r\nher face.\r\n\r\nBefore he looked up, he had been thinking chiefly of his poem and its\r\neffect. Straightway he forgot it. Her arms hung limply before her, and\r\nher hands were clasped together. Her eyes were very tender.\r\n\r\n\"Your verses go to the heart,\" she said softly.\r\n\r\nHer mobile features were capable of wonderful shades of expression. He\r\nsuddenly forgot his wife and his position as a minor poet as he looked\r\nat her. It is possible that his classical features may themselves have\r\nundergone a certain transfiguration. For one brief moment--and it was\r\nalways to linger in his memory--destiny lifted him out of his vain\r\nlittle self to a nobler level of simplicity. The copy of \"Tenderly\r\never\" fluttered from his hand. Considerations vanished. Only one thing\r\nseemed of importance.\r\n\r\n\"I love you,\" he said abruptly.\r\n\r\nAn expression of fear came into her eyes. The grip of her hands upon\r\none another tightened convulsively. She became very pale.\r\n\r\nThen she moved her lips as if to speak, bringing her face slightly\r\nnearer to his. There was nothing in the world at that moment for either\r\nof them but one another. They were both trembling exceedingly. In a\r\nwhisper she said, \"You love me?\"\r\n\r\nAubrey Vair stood quivering and speechless, looking into her eyes. He\r\nhad never seen such a light as he saw there before. He was in a wild\r\ntumult of emotion. He was dreadfully scared at what he had done. He\r\ncould not say another word. He nodded.\r\n\r\n\"And this has come to me?\" she said presently, in the same awe-stricken\r\nwhisper, and then, \"Oh, my love, my love!\"\r\n\r\nAnd thereupon Aubrey Vair had her clasped to himself, her cheek upon\r\nhis shoulder and his lips to hers.\r\n\r\nThus it was that Aubrey Vair came by the cardinal memory of his life.\r\nTo this day it recurs in his works.\r\n\r\nA little boy clambering in the hedge some way down the lane saw this\r\ngroup with surprise, and then with scorn and contempt. Recking nothing\r\nof his destiny, he turned away, feeling that he at least could never\r\ncome to the unspeakable unmanliness of hugging girls. Unhappily for\r\nReigate scandal, his shame for his sex was altogether too deep for\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn hour after, Aubrey Vair returned home in a hushed mood. There were\r\nmuffins after his own heart for his tea--Mrs. Aubrey Vair had had\r\nhers. And there were chrysanthemums, chiefly white ones,--flowers he\r\nloved,--set out in the china bowl he was wont to praise. And his wife\r\ncame behind him to kiss him as he sat eating.\r\n\r\n\"De lill Jummuns,\" she remarked, kissing him under the ear.\r\n\r\nThen it came into the mind of Aubrey Vair with startling clearness,\r\nwhile his ear was being kissed, and with his mouth full of muffin, that\r\nlife is a singularly complex thing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe summer passed at last into the harvest-time, and the leaves began\r\nfalling. It was evening, the warm sunset light still touched the Downs,\r\nbut up the valley a blue haze was creeping. One or two lamps in Reigate\r\nwere already alight.\r\n\r\nAbout half-way up the slanting road that scales the Downs, there is\r\na wooden seat where one may obtain a fine view of the red villas\r\nscattered below, and of the succession of blue hills beyond. Here the\r\ngirl with the shadowy face was sitting.\r\n\r\nShe had a book on her knees, but it lay neglected. She was leaning\r\nforward, her chin resting upon her hand. She was looking across the\r\nvalley into the darkening sky, with troubled eyes.\r\n\r\nAubrey Vair appeared through the hazel-bushes, and sat down beside her.\r\nHe held half a dozen dead leaves in his hand.\r\n\r\nShe did not alter her attitude. \"Well?\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Is it to be flight?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nAubrey Vair was rather pale. He had been having bad nights latterly,\r\nwith dreams of the Continental Express, Mrs. Aubrey Vair possibly even\r\nin pursuit,--he always fancied her making the tragedy ridiculous by\r\ntearfully bringing additional pairs of socks, and any such trifles he\r\nhad forgotten, with her,--all Reigate and Redhill in commotion. He had\r\nnever eloped before, and he had visions of difficulties with hotel\r\nproprietors. Mrs. Aubrey Vair might telegraph ahead. Even he had had a\r\nprophetic vision of a headline in a halfpenny evening newspaper: \"Young\r\nLady abducts a Minor Poet.\" So there was a quaver in his voice as he\r\nasked, \"Is it to be flight?\"\r\n\r\n\"As you will,\" she answered, still not looking at him.\r\n\r\n\"I want you to consider particularly how this will affect you. A man,\"\r\nsaid Aubrey Vair, slowly, and staring hard at the leaves in his hand,\r\n\"even gains a certain éclat in these affairs. But to a woman it is\r\nruin--social, moral.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is not love,\" said the girl in white.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, my dearest! Think of yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stupid!\" she said, under her breath.\r\n\r\n\"You spoke?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"But cannot we go on, meeting one another, loving one another, without\r\nany great scandal or misery? Could we not\"--\r\n\r\n\"That,\" interrupted Miss Smith, \"would be unspeakably horrible.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is a dreadful conversation to me. Life is so intricate, such a\r\nweb of subtle strands binds us this way and that. I cannot tell what is\r\nright. You must consider\"--\r\n\r\n\"A man would break such strands.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no manliness,\" said Aubrey Vair, with a sudden glow of moral\r\nexaltation, \"in doing wrong. My love\"--\r\n\r\n\"We could at least die together, dearest,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Good Lord!\" said Aubrey Vair. \"I mean--consider my wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have not considered her hitherto.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is a flavour--of cowardice, of desertion, about suicide,\" said\r\nAubrey Vair. \"Frankly, I have the English prejudice, and do not like\r\nany kind of running away.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Smith smiled very faintly. \"I see clearly now what I did not see.\r\nMy love and yours are very different things.\"\r\n\r\n\"Possibly it is a sexual difference,\" said Aubrey Vair; and then,\r\nfeeling the remark inadequate, he relapsed into silence.\r\n\r\nThey sat for some time without a word. The two lights in Reigate below\r\nmultiplied to a score of bright points, and, above, one star had become\r\nvisible. She began laughing, an almost noiseless, hysterical laugh that\r\njarred unaccountably upon Aubrey Vair.\r\n\r\nPresently she stood up. \"They will wonder where I am,\" she said. \"I\r\nthink I must be going.\"\r\n\r\nHe followed her to the road. \"Then this is the end?\" he said, with a\r\ncurious mixture of relief and poignant regret.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, this is the end,\" she answered, and turned away.\r\n\r\nThere straightway dropped into the soul of Aubrey Vair a sense of\r\ninfinite loss. It was an altogether new sensation. She was perhaps\r\ntwenty yards away, when he groaned aloud with the weight of it, and\r\nsuddenly began running after her with his arms extended.\r\n\r\n\"Annie,\" he cried,--\"Annie! I have been talking _rot_. Annie, now\r\nI know I love you! I cannot spare you. This must not be. I did not\r\nunderstand.\"\r\n\r\nThe weight was horrible.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, stop, Annie!\" he cried, with a breaking voice, and there were\r\ntears on his face.\r\n\r\nShe turned upon him suddenly, and his arms fell by his side. His\r\nexpression changed at the sight of her pale face.\r\n\r\n\"You do not understand,\" she said. \"I have said good-bye.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him; he was evidently greatly distressed, a little out of\r\nbreath, and he had just stopped blubbering. His contemptible quality\r\nreached the pathetic. She came up close to him, and, taking his damp\r\nByronic visage between her hands, she kissed him again and again.\r\n\"Good-bye, little man that I loved,\" she said; \"and good-bye to this\r\nfolly of love.\"\r\n\r\nThen, with something that may have been a laugh or a sob,--she herself,\r\nwhen she came to write it all in her novel, did not know which,--she\r\nturned and hurried away again, and went out of the path that Aubrey\r\nVair must pursue, at the cross-roads.\r\n\r\nAubrey Vair stood, where she had kissed him, with a mind as inactive\r\nas his body, until her white dress had disappeared. Then he gave an\r\ninvoluntary sigh, a large exhaustive expiration, and so awoke himself,\r\nand began walking, pensively dragging his feet through the dead leaves,\r\nhome. Emotions are terrible things.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Do you like the potatoes, dear?\" asked Mrs. Aubrey Vair at dinner. \"I\r\ncooked them myself.\"\r\n\r\nAubrey Vair descended slowly from cloudy, impalpable meditations to the\r\nlevel of fried potatoes. \"These potatoes\"--he remarked, after a pause\r\nduring which he was struggling with recollection. \"Yes. These potatoes\r\nhave exactly the tints of the dead leaves of the hazel.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a fanciful poet it is!\" said Mrs. Aubrey Vair. \"Taste them. They\r\nare very nice potatoes indeed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA CATASTROPHE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe little shop was not paying. The realisation came insensibly.\r\nWinslow was not the man for definite addition and subtraction\r\nand sudden discovery. He became aware of the truth in his mind\r\ngradually, as though it had always been there. A lot of facts had\r\nconverged and led him there. There was that line of cretonnes--four\r\nhalf-pieces--untouched, save for half a yard sold to cover a stool.\r\nThere were those shirtings at 4¾d.--Bandersnatch, in the Broadway,\r\nwas selling them at 2¾d.--under cost, in fact. (Surely Bandersnatch\r\nmight let a man live!) Those servants' caps, a selling line, needed\r\nreplenishing, and that brought back the memory of Winslow's sole\r\nwholesale dealers, Helter, Skelter, & Grab. Why! how about their\r\naccount?\r\n\r\nWinslow stood with a big green box open on the counter before him\r\nwhen he thought of it. His pale grey eyes grew a little rounder; his\r\npale, straggling moustache twitched. He had been drifting along, day\r\nafter day. He went round to the ramshackle cash-desk in the corner--it\r\nwas Winslow's weakness to sell his goods over the counter, give his\r\ncustomers a duplicate bill, and then dodge into the desk to receive\r\nthe money, as though he doubted his own honesty. His lank forefinger,\r\nwith the prominent joints, ran down the bright little calendar\r\n(\"Clack's Cottons last for All Time\"). \"One--two--three; three weeks\r\nan' a day!\" said Winslow, staring. \"March! Only three weeks and a day.\r\nIt _can't_ be.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tea, dear,\" said Mrs. Winslow, opening the door with the glass window\r\nand the white blind that communicated with the parlour.\r\n\r\n\"One minute,\" said Winslow, and began unlocking the desk.\r\n\r\nAn irritable old gentleman, very hot and red about the face, and in a\r\nheavy fur-lined cloak, came in noisily. Mrs. Winslow vanished.\r\n\r\n\"Ugh!\" said the old gentleman. \"Pocket-handkerchief.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Winslow. \"About what price\"--\r\n\r\n\"Ugh!\" said the old gentleman. \"Poggit-handkerchief, quig!\"\r\n\r\nWinslow began to feel flustered. He produced two boxes.\r\n\r\n\"These, sir\"--began Winslow.\r\n\r\n\"Sheed tin!\" said the old gentleman, clutching the stiffness of the\r\nlinen. \"Wad to blow my nose--not haggit about.\"\r\n\r\n\"A cotton one, p'raps, sir?\" said Winslow.\r\n\r\n\"How much?\" said the old gentleman over the handkerchief.\r\n\r\n\"Sevenpence, sir. There's nothing more I can show you? No ties,\r\nbraces--?\"\r\n\r\n\"Damn!\" said the old gentleman, fumbling in his ticket-pocket, and\r\nfinally producing half a crown. Winslow looked round for his little\r\nmetallic duplicate-book which he kept in various fixtures, according\r\nto circumstances, and then he caught the old gentleman's eye. He\r\nwent straight to the desk at once and got the change, with an entire\r\ndisregard of the routine of the shop.\r\n\r\nWinslow was always more or less excited by a customer. But the open\r\ndesk reminded him of his trouble. It did not come back to him all at\r\nonce. He heard a finger-nail softly tapping on the glass, and, looking\r\nup, saw Minnie's eyes over the blind. It seemed like retreat opening.\r\nHe shut and locked the desk, and went into the little room to tea.\r\n\r\nBut he was preoccupied. Three weeks and a day! He took unusually large\r\nbites of his bread and butter, and stared hard at the little pot of\r\njam. He answered Minnie's conversational advances distractedly. The\r\nshadow of Helter, Skelter, & Grab lay upon the tea-table. He was\r\nstruggling with this new idea of failure, the tangible realisation,\r\nthat was taking shape and substance, condensing, as it were, out\r\nof the misty uneasiness of many days. At present it was simply one\r\nconcrete fact; there were thirty-nine pounds left in the bank, and that\r\nday three weeks Messrs. Helter, Skelter, & Grab, those enterprising\r\noutfitters of young men, would demand their eighty pounds.\r\n\r\nAfter tea there was a customer or so--little purchases: some muslin\r\nand buckram, dress-protectors, tape, and a pair of Lisle hose. Then,\r\nknowing that Black Care was lurking in the dusky corners of the shop,\r\nhe lit the three lamps early and set to, refolding his cotton prints,\r\nthe most vigorous and least meditative proceeding of which he could\r\nthink. He could see Minnie's shadow in the other room as she moved\r\nabout the table. She was busy turning an old dress. He had a walk after\r\nsupper, looked in at the Y.M.C.A., but found no one to talk to, and\r\nfinally went to bed. Minnie was already there. And there, too, waiting\r\nfor him, nudging him gently, until about midnight he was hopelessly\r\nawake, sat Black Care.\r\n\r\nHe had had one or two nights lately in that company, but this was\r\nmuch worse. First came Messrs. Helter, Skelter, & Grab, and their\r\ndemand for eighty pounds--an enormous sum when your original capital\r\nwas only a hundred and seventy. They camped, as it were, before him,\r\nsat down and beleaguered him. He clutched feebly at the circumambient\r\ndarkness for expedients. Suppose he had a sale, sold things for almost\r\nanything? He tried to imagine a sale miraculously successful in some\r\nunexpected manner, and mildly profitable, in spite of reductions below\r\ncost. Then Bandersnatch Limited, 101, 102, 103, 105, 106, 107 Broadway,\r\njoined the siege, a long caterpillar of frontage, a battery of shop\r\nfronts, wherein things were sold at a farthing above cost. How could\r\nhe fight such an establishment? Besides, what had he to sell? He began\r\nto review his resources. What taking line was there to bait the sale?\r\nThen straightway came those pieces of cretonne, yellow and black, with\r\na bluish-green flower; those discredited skirtings, prints without\r\nbuoyancy, skirmishing haberdashery, some despairful four-button gloves\r\nby an inferior maker--a hopeless crew. And that was his force against\r\nBandersnatch, Helter, Skelter, & Grab, and the pitiless world behind\r\nthem. Whatever had made him think a mortal would buy such things?\r\nWhy had he bought this and neglected that? He suddenly realised the\r\nintensity of his hatred for Helter, Skelter, & Grab's salesman. Then\r\nhe drove towards an agony of self-reproach. He had spent too much\r\non that cash-desk. What real need was there of a desk? He saw his\r\nvanity of that desk in a lurid glow of self-discovery. And the lamps?\r\nFive pounds! Then suddenly, with what was almost physical pain, he\r\nremembered the rent.\r\n\r\nHe groaned and turned over. And there, dim in the darkness, was the\r\nhummock of Mrs. Winslow's shoulders. That set him off in another\r\ndirection. He became acutely sensible of Minnie's want of feeling. Here\r\nhe was, worried to death about business, and she sleeping like a little\r\nchild. He regretted having married, with that infinite bitterness that\r\nonly comes to the human heart in the small hours of the morning. That\r\nhummock of white seemed absolutely without helpfulness, a burden, a\r\nresponsibility. What fools men were to marry! Minnie's inert repose\r\nirritated him so much that he was almost provoked to wake her up and\r\ntell her that they were \"Ruined.\" She would have to go back to her\r\nuncle; her uncle had always been against him: and as for his own\r\nfuture, Winslow was exceedingly uncertain. A shop assistant who has\r\nonce set up for himself finds the utmost difficulty in getting into a\r\nsituation again. He began to figure himself \"crib-hunting\" again, going\r\nfrom this wholesale house to that, writing innumerable letters. How\r\nhe hated writing letters! \"Sir,--Referring to your advertisement in\r\nthe _Christian World_.\" He beheld an infinite vista of discomfort and\r\ndisappointment, ending--in a gulf.\r\n\r\nHe dressed, yawning, and went down to open the shop. He felt tired\r\nbefore the day began. As he carried the shutters in, he kept asking\r\nhimself what good he was doing. The end was inevitable, whether he\r\nbothered or not. The clear daylight smote into the place, and showed\r\nhow old and rough and splintered was the floor, how shabby the\r\nsecond-hand counter, how hopeless the whole enterprise. He had been\r\ndreaming these past six months of a bright little shop, of a happy\r\ncouple, of a modest but comely profit flowing in. He had suddenly\r\nawakened from his dream. The braid that bound his decent black coat--it\r\nwas a little loose--caught against the catch of the shop door, and was\r\ntorn loose. This suddenly turned his wretchedness to wrath. He stood\r\nquivering for a moment, then, with a spiteful clutch, tore the braid\r\nlooser, and went in to Minnie.\r\n\r\n\"Here,\" he said, with infinite reproach; \"look here! You might look\r\nafter a chap a bit.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't see it was torn,\" said Minnie.\r\n\r\n\"You never do,\" said Winslow, with gross injustice, \"until things are\r\ntoo late.\"\r\n\r\nMinnie looked suddenly at his face. \"I'll sew it now, Sid, if you like.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's have breakfast first,\" said Winslow, \"and do things at their\r\nproper time.\"\r\n\r\nHe was preoccupied at breakfast, and Minnie watched him anxiously.\r\nHis only remark was to declare his egg a bad one. It wasn't; it was a\r\nlittle flavoury,--being one of those at fifteen a shilling,--but quite\r\nnice. He pushed it away from him, and then, having eaten a slice of\r\nbread and butter, admitted himself in the wrong by resuming the egg.\r\n\r\n\"Sid,\" said Minnie, as he stood up to go into the shop again, \"you're\r\nnot well.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm _well_ enough.\" He looked at her as though he hated her.\r\n\r\n\"Then there's something else the matter. You aren't angry with me, Sid,\r\nare you, about that braid? _Do_ tell me what's the matter. You were\r\njust like this at tea yesterday, and at supper-time. It wasn't the\r\nbraid then.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I'm likely to be.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked interrogation. \"Oh, what _is_ the matter?\" she said.\r\n\r\nIt was too good a chance to miss, and he brought the evil news out with\r\ndramatic force. \"Matter?\" he said. \"I done my best, and here we are.\r\nThat's the matter! If I can't pay Helter, Skelter & Grab eighty pounds,\r\nthis day three week\"--Pause. \"We shall be sold up! Sold up! That's the\r\nmatter, Min! SOLD UP!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Sid!\" began Minnie.\r\n\r\nHe slammed the door. For the moment he felt relieved of at least half\r\nhis misery. He began dusting boxes that did not require dusting,\r\nand then reblocked a cretonne already faultlessly blocked. He was\r\nin a state of grim wretchedness; a martyr under the harrow of fate.\r\nAt anyrate, it should not be said he failed for want of industry.\r\nAnd how he had planned and contrived and worked! All to this end!\r\nHe felt horrible doubts. Providence and Bandersnatch--surely they\r\nwere incompatible! Perhaps he was being \"tried\"? That sent him\r\noff upon a new tack, a very comforting one. That martyr pose, the\r\ngold-in-the-furnace attitude, lasted all the morning.\r\n\r\nAt dinner--\"potato pie\"--he looked up suddenly, and saw Minnie's face\r\nregarding him. Pale she looked, and a little red about the eyes.\r\nSomething caught him suddenly with a queer effect upon his throat. All\r\nhis thoughts seemed to wheel round into quite a new direction.\r\n\r\nHe pushed back his plate and stared at her blankly. Then he got up,\r\nwent round the table to her--she staring at him. He dropped on his\r\nknees beside her without a word. \"Oh, Minnie!\" he said, and suddenly\r\nshe knew it was peace, and put her arms about him, as he began to sob\r\nand weep.\r\n\r\nHe cried like a little boy, slobbering on her shoulder that he was a\r\nknave to have married her and brought her to this, that he hadn't the\r\nwits to be trusted with a penny, that it was all his fault, that he\r\n\"_had_ hoped _so_\"--ending in a howl. And she, crying gently herself,\r\npatting his shoulders, said \"_Ssh!_\" softly to his noisy weeping, and\r\nso soothed the outbreak. Then suddenly the crazy little bell upon the\r\nshop door began, and Winslow had to jump to his feet, and be a man\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nAfter that scene they \"talked it over\" at tea, at supper, in\r\nbed, at every possible interval in between, solemnly--quite\r\ninconclusively--with set faces and eyes for the most part staring in\r\nfront of them--and yet with a certain mutual comfort. \"What to do I\r\ndon't know,\" was Winslow's main proposition. Minnie tried to take a\r\ncheerful view of service--with a probable baby. But she found she\r\nneeded all her courage. And her uncle would help her again, perhaps,\r\njust at the critical time. It didn't do for folks to be too proud.\r\nBesides, \"something might happen,\" a favourite formula with her.\r\n\r\nOne hopeful line was to anticipate a sudden afflux of customers.\r\n\"Perhaps,\" said Minnie, \"you might get together fifty. They know you\r\nwell enough to trust you a bit.\" They debated that point. Once the\r\npossibility of Helter, Skelter and Grab giving credit was admitted,\r\nit was pleasant to begin sweating the acceptable minimum. For some\r\nhalf-hour over tea the second day after Winslow's discoveries they\r\nwere quite cheerful again, laughing even at their terrific fears. Even\r\ntwenty pounds to go on with might be considered enough. Then in some\r\nmysterious way the pleasant prospect of Messrs. Helter, Skelter, & Grab\r\ntempering the wind to the shorn retailer vanished--vanished absolutely,\r\nand Winslow found himself again in the pit of despair.\r\n\r\nHe began looking about at the furniture, and wondering idly what\r\nit would fetch. The chiffonier was good, anyhow, and there were\r\nMinnie's old plates that her mother used to have. Then he began to\r\nthink of desperate expedients for putting off the evil day. He had\r\nheard somewhere of Bills of Sale--there was to his ears something\r\ncomfortingly substantial in the phrase. Then, why not \"Go to the\r\nMoney-Lenders\"?\r\n\r\nOne cheering thing happened on Thursday afternoon; a little girl came\r\nin with a pattern of \"print,\" and he was able to match it. He had not\r\nbeen able to match anything out of his meagre stock before. He went\r\nin and told Minnie. The incident is mentioned lest the reader should\r\nimagine it was uniform despair with him.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, and the next, after the discovery, Winslow opened\r\nshop late. When one has been awake most of the night, and has no hope,\r\nwhat _is_ the good of getting up punctually? But as he went into the\r\ndark shop on Friday he saw something lying on the floor, something\r\nlit by the bright light that came under the ill-fitting door--a black\r\noblong. He stooped and picked up an envelope with a deep mourning edge.\r\nIt was addressed to his wife. Clearly a death in her family--perhaps\r\nher uncle. He knew the man too well to have expectations. And they\r\nwould have to get mourning and go to the funeral. The brutal cruelty\r\nof people dying! He saw it all in a flash--he always visualised his\r\nthoughts. Black trousers to get, black crape, black gloves--none in\r\nstock--the railway fares, the shop closed for the day.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid there's bad news, Minnie,\" he said.\r\n\r\nShe was kneeling before the fireplace, blowing the fire. She had her\r\nhousemaid's gloves on and the old country sun-bonnet she wore of\r\na morning, to keep the dust out of her hair. She turned, saw the\r\nenvelope, gave a gasp, and pressed two bloodless lips together.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid it's uncle,\" she said, holding the letter and staring with\r\neyes wide open into Winslow's face. \"_It's a strange hand!_\"\r\n\r\n\"The postmark's Hull,\" said Winslow.\r\n\r\n\"The postmark's Hull.\"\r\n\r\nMinnie opened the letter slowly, drew it out, hesitated, turned it\r\nover, saw the signature. \"It's Mr. Speight!\"\r\n\r\n\"What does he say?\" said Winslow.\r\n\r\nMinnie began to read. \"_Oh!_\" she screamed. She dropped the letter,\r\ncollapsed into a crouching heap, her hands covering her eyes. Winslow\r\nsnatched at it. \"A most terrible accident has occurred,\" he read;\r\n\"Melchior's chimney fell down yesterday evening right on the top of\r\nyour uncle's house, and every living soul was killed--your uncle,\r\nyour cousin Mary, Will and Ned, and the girl--every one of them, and\r\nsmashed--you would hardly know them. I'm writing to you to break the\r\nnews before you see it in the papers\"--The letter fluttered from\r\nWinslow's fingers. He put out his hand against the mantel to steady\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nAll of them dead! Then he saw, as in a vision, a row of seven cottages,\r\neach let at seven shillings a week, a timber yard, two villas, and the\r\nruins--still marketable--of the avuncular residence. He tried to feel\r\na sense of loss and could not. They were sure to have been left to\r\nMinnie's aunt. All dead! 7×7×52÷20 began insensibly to work itself out\r\nin his mind, but discipline was ever weak in his mental arithmetic;\r\nfigures kept moving from one line to another, like children playing\r\nat Widdy, Widdy Way. Was it two hundred pounds about--or one hundred\r\npounds? Presently he picked up the letter again, and finishing reading\r\nit. \"You being the next of kin,\" said Mr. Speight.\r\n\r\n\"How _awful_!\" said Minnie in a horror-struck whisper, and looking up\r\nat last. Winslow stared back at her, shaking his head solemnly. There\r\nwere a thousand things running through his mind, but none that, even\r\nto his dull sense, seemed appropriate as a remark. \"It was the Lord's\r\nwill,\" he said at last.\r\n\r\n\"It seems so very, very terrible,\" said Minnie; \"auntie, dear\r\nauntie--Ted--poor, dear uncle\"--\r\n\r\n\"It was the Lord's will, Minnie,\" said Winslow, with infinite feeling.\r\nA long silence.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Minnie, very slowly, staring thoughtfully at the crackling\r\nblack paper in the grate. The fire had gone out. \"Yes, perhaps it was\r\nthe Lord's will.\"\r\n\r\nThey looked gravely at one another. Each would have been terribly\r\nshocked at any mention of the property by the other. She turned to the\r\ndark fireplace and began tearing up an old newspaper slowly. Whatever\r\nour losses may be, the world's work still waits for us. Winslow gave a\r\ndeep sigh and walked in a hushed manner towards the front door. As he\r\nopened it, a flood of sunlight came streaming into the dark shadows of\r\nthe closed shop. Bandersnatch, Helter, Skelter, & Grab, had vanished\r\nout of his mind like the mists before the rising sun.\r\n\r\nPresently he was carrying in the shutters, and in the briskest way,\r\nthe fire in the kitchen was crackling exhilaratingly, with a little\r\nsaucepan walloping above it, for Minnie was boiling two eggs,--one for\r\nherself this morning, as well as one for him,--and Minnie herself was\r\naudible, laying breakfast with the greatest _éclat_. The blow was a\r\nsudden and terrible one--but it behoves us to face such things bravely\r\nin this sad, unaccountable world. It was quite midday before either of\r\nthem mentioned the cottages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LOST INHERITANCE\r\n\r\n\r\n\"My uncle,\" said the man with the glass eye, \"was what you might call\r\na hemi-semi-demi millionaire. He was worth about a hundred and twenty\r\nthousand. Quite. And he left me all his money.\"\r\n\r\nI glanced at the shiny sleeve of his coat, and my eye travelled up to\r\nthe frayed collar.\r\n\r\n\"Every penny,\" said the man with the glass eye, and I caught the active\r\npupil looking at me with a touch of offence.\r\n\r\n\"I've never had any windfalls like that,\" I said, trying to speak\r\nenviously and propitiate him.\r\n\r\n\"Even a legacy isn't always a blessing,\" he remarked with a sigh, and\r\nwith an air of philosophical resignation he put the red nose and the\r\nwiry moustache into his tankard for a space.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps not,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"He was an author, you see, and he wrote a lot of books.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed!\"\r\n\r\n\"That was the trouble of it all.\" He stared at me with the available\r\neye to see if I grasped his statement, then averted his face a little\r\nand produced a toothpick.\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" he said, smacking his lips after a pause, \"it was like this.\r\nHe was my uncle--my maternal uncle. And he had--what shall I call\r\nit?--a weakness for writing edifying literature. Weakness is hardly\r\nthe word--downright mania is nearer the mark. He'd been librarian in a\r\nPolytechnic, and as soon as the money came to him he began to indulge\r\nhis ambition. It's a simply extraordinary and incomprehensible thing\r\nto me. Here was a man of thirty-seven suddenly dropped into a perfect\r\npile of gold, and he didn't go--not a day's bust on it. One would think\r\na chap would go and get himself dressed a bit decent--say a couple of\r\ndozen pairs of trousers at a West End tailor's; but he never did. You'd\r\nhardly believe it, but when he died he hadn't even a gold watch. It\r\nseems wrong for people like that to have money. All he did was just to\r\ntake a house, and order in pretty nearly five tons of books and ink and\r\npaper, and set to writing edifying literature as hard as ever he could\r\nwrite. I _can't_ understand it! But he did. The money came to him,\r\ncuriously enough, through a maternal uncle of _his_, unexpected like,\r\nwhen he was seven-and-thirty. My mother, it happened, was his only\r\nrelation in the wide, wide world, except some second cousins of his.\r\nAnd I was her only son. You follow all that? The second cousins had one\r\nonly son, too, but they brought him to see the old man too soon. He was\r\nrather a spoilt youngster, was this son of theirs, and directly he set\r\neyes on my uncle, he began bawling out as hard as he could. 'Take 'im\r\naway--er,' he says, 'take 'im away,' and so did for himself entirely.\r\nIt was pretty straight sailing, you'd think, for me, eh? And my mother,\r\nbeing a sensible, careful woman, settled the business in her own mind\r\nlong before he did.\r\n\r\n\"He was a curious little chap, was my uncle, as I remember him. I\r\ndon't wonder at the kid being scared. Hair, just like these Japanese\r\ndolls they sell, black and straight and stiff all round the brim and\r\nnone in the middle, and below, a whitish kind of face and rather\r\nlarge dark grey eyes moving about behind his spectacles. He used to\r\nattach a great deal of importance to dress, and always wore a flapping\r\novercoat and a big-brimmed felt hat of a most extraordinary size. He\r\nlooked a rummy little beggar, I can tell you. Indoors it was, as a\r\nrule, a dirty red flannel dressing-gown and a black skull-cap he had.\r\nThat black skull-cap made him look like the portraits of all kinds of\r\ncelebrated people. He was always moving about from house to house,\r\nwas my uncle, with his chair which had belonged to Savage Landor, and\r\nhis two writing-tables, one of Carlyle's and the other of Shelley's,\r\nso the dealer told him, and the completest portable reference library\r\nin England, he said he had--and he lugged the whole caravan, now to a\r\nhouse at Down, near Darwin's old place, then to Reigate, near Meredith,\r\nthen off to Haslemere, then back to Chelsea for a bit, and then up to\r\nHampstead. He knew there was something wrong with his stuff, but he\r\nnever knew there was anything wrong with his brains. It was always the\r\nair, or the water, or the altitude, or some tommy-rot like that. 'So\r\nmuch depends on environment,' he used to say, and stare at you hard, as\r\nif he half suspected you were hiding a grin at him somewhere under your\r\nface. 'So much depends on environment to a sensitive mind like mine.'\r\n\r\n\"What was his name? You wouldn't know it if I told you. He wrote\r\nnothing that anyone has ever read--nothing. No one _could_ read it.\r\nHe wanted to be a great teacher, he said, and he didn't know what he\r\nwanted to teach any more than a child. So he just blethered at large\r\nabout Truth and Righteousness, and the Spirit of History, and all\r\nthat. Book after book he wrote and published at his own expense. He\r\nwasn't quite right in his head, you know, really; and to hear him go\r\non at the critics--not because they slated him, mind you--he liked\r\nthat--but because they didn't take any notice of him at all. 'What\r\ndo the nations want?' he would ask, holding out his brown old claw.\r\n'Why, teaching--guidance! They are scattered upon the hills like sheep\r\nwithout a shepherd. There is War and Rumours of War, the unlaid Spirit\r\nof Discord abroad in the land, Nihilism, Vivisection, Vaccination,\r\nDrunkenness, Penury, Want, Socialistic Error, Selfish Capital! Do\r\nyou see the clouds, Ted?'--My name, you know--'Do you see the clouds\r\nlowering over the land? and behind it all--the Mongol waits!' He\r\nwas always very great on Mongols and the Spectre of Socialism, and\r\nsuch-like things.\r\n\r\n\"Then out would come his finger at me, and with his eyes all afire and\r\nhis skull-cap askew, he would whisper: 'And here am I. What do I want?\r\nNations to teach. Nations! I say it with all modesty, Ted, I _could_. I\r\nwould guide them; nay! but I _will_ guide them to a safe haven, to the\r\nland of Righteousness, flowing with milk and honey.'\r\n\r\n\"That's how he used to go on. Ramble, rave about the nations, and\r\nrighteousness, and that kind of thing. Kind of mincemeat of Bible and\r\nblethers. From fourteen up to three-and-twenty, when I might have\r\nbeen improving my mind, my mother used to wash me and brush my hair\r\n(at least in the earlier years of it), with a nice parting down the\r\nmiddle, and take me, once or twice a week, to hear this old lunatic\r\njabber about things he had read of in the morning papers, trying to do\r\nit as much like Carlyle as he could, and I used to sit according to\r\ninstructions, and look intelligent and nice, and pretend to be taking\r\nit all in. Afterwards I used to go of my own free will, out of a regard\r\nfor the legacy. I was the only person that used to go and see him.\r\nHe wrote, I believe, to every man who made the slightest stir in the\r\nworld, sending him a copy or so of his books, and inviting him to come\r\nand talk about the nations to him; but half of them didn't answer,\r\nand none ever came. And when the girl let you in--she was an artful\r\nbit of goods, that girl--there were heaps of letters on the hall-seat\r\nwaiting to go off, addressed to Prince Bismark, the President of the\r\nUnited States, and such-like people. And one went up the staircase\r\nand along the cobwebby passage,--the housekeeper drank like fury, and\r\nhis passages were always cobwebby,--and found him at last, with books\r\nturned down all over the room, and heaps of torn paper on the floor,\r\nand telegrams and newspapers littered about, and empty coffee-cups and\r\nhalf-eaten bits of toast on the desk and the mantel. You'd see his back\r\nhumped up, and his hair would be sticking out quite straight between\r\nthe collar of that dressing-gown thing and the edge of the skull-cap.\r\n\r\n\"'A moment!' he would say. 'A moment!' over his shoulder. 'The _mot\r\njuste_, you know, Ted, _le mot juste_. Righteous thought righteously\r\nexpressed--Aah!--concatenation. And now, Ted,' he'd say, spinning round\r\nin his study chair, 'how's Young England?' That was his silly name for\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\"Well, that was my uncle, and that was how he talked--to me, at\r\nanyrate. With others about he seemed a bit shy. And he not only talked\r\nto me, but he gave me his books, books of six hundred pages or so,\r\nwith cock-eyed headings, 'The Shrieking Sisterhood,' 'The Behemoth of\r\nBigotry,' 'Crucibles and Cullenders,' and so on. All very strong, and\r\nnone of them original. The very last time but one that I saw him he\r\ngave me a book. He was feeling ill even then, and his hand shook and he\r\nwas despondent. I noticed it because I was naturally on the look-out\r\nfor those little symptoms. 'My last book, Ted,' he said. 'My last book,\r\nmy boy; my last word to the deaf and hardened nations;' and I'm hanged\r\nif a tear didn't go rolling down his yellow old cheek. He was regular\r\ncrying because it was so nearly over, and he hadn't only written about\r\nfifty-three books of rubbish. 'I've sometimes thought, Ted'--he said,\r\nand stopped.\r\n\r\n\"'Perhaps I've been a bit hasty and angry with this stiff-necked\r\ngeneration. A little more sweetness, perhaps, and a little less\r\nblinding light. I've sometimes thought--I might have swayed them. But\r\nI've done my best, Ted.'\r\n\r\n\"And then, with a burst, for the first and last time in his life\r\nhe owned himself a failure. It showed he was really ill. He seemed\r\nto think for a minute, and then he spoke quietly and low, as sane\r\nand sober as I am now. 'I've been a fool, Ted,' he said. 'I've been\r\nflapping nonsense all my life. Only He who readeth the heart knows\r\nwhether this is anything more than vanity. Ted, I don't. But He knows,\r\nHe knows, and if I have done foolishly and vainly, in my heart--in my\r\nheart'--\r\n\r\n\"Just like that he spoke, repeating himself, and he stopped quite short\r\nand handed the book to me, trembling. Then the old shine came back into\r\nhis eye. I remember it all fairly well, because I repeated it and acted\r\nit to my old mother when I got home, to cheer her up a bit. 'Take this\r\nbook and read it,' he said. 'It's my last word, my very last word. I've\r\nleft all my property to you, Ted, and may you use it better than I have\r\ndone.' And then he fell a-coughing.\r\n\r\n\"I remember that quite well even now, and how I went home cock-a-hoop,\r\nand how he was in bed the next time I called. The housekeeper was\r\ndownstairs drunk, and I fooled about--as a young man will--with the\r\ngirl in the passage before I went to him. He was sinking fast. But even\r\nthen his vanity clung to him.\r\n\r\n\"'Have you read it?' he whispered.\r\n\r\n\"'Sat up all night reading it,' I said in his ear to cheer him. 'It's\r\nthe last,' said I, and then, with a memory of some poetry or other in\r\nmy head, 'but it's the bravest and best.'\r\n\r\n\"He smiled a little and tried to squeeze my hand as a woman might do,\r\nand left off squeezing in the middle, and lay still. 'The bravest and\r\nthe best,' said I again, seeing it pleased him. But he didn't answer.\r\nI heard the girl giggle outside the door, for occasionally we'd had\r\njust a bit of innocent laughter, you know, at his ways. I looked at\r\nhis face, and his eyes were closed, and it was just as if somebody had\r\npunched in his nose on either side. But he was still smiling. It's\r\nqueer to think of--he lay dead, lay dead there, an utter failure, with\r\nthe smile of success on his face.\r\n\r\n\"That was the end of my uncle. You can imagine me and my mother saw\r\nthat he had a decent funeral. Then, of course, came the hunt for the\r\nwill. We began decent and respectful at first, and before the day was\r\nout we were ripping chairs, and smashing bureau panels, and sounding\r\nwalls. Every hour we expected those others to come in. We asked the\r\nhousekeeper, and found she'd actually witnessed a will--on an ordinary\r\nhalf-sheet of notepaper it was written, and very short, she said--not\r\na month ago. The other witness was the gardener, and he bore her out\r\nword for word. But I'm hanged if there was that or any other will to\r\nbe found. The way my mother talked must have made him turn in his\r\ngrave. At last a lawyer at Reigate sprang one on us that had been made\r\nyears ago during some temporary quarrel with my mother. I'm blest if\r\nthat wasn't the only will to be discovered anywhere, and it left every\r\npenny he possessed to that 'Take 'im away' youngster of his second\r\ncousin's--a chap who'd never had to stand his talking not for one\r\nafternoon of his life.\"\r\n\r\nThe man with the glass eye stopped.\r\n\r\n\"I thought you said\"--I began.\r\n\r\n\"Half a minute,\" said the man with the glass eye. \"_I_ had to wait\r\nfor the end of the story till this very morning, and I was a blessed\r\nsight more interested than you are. You just wait a bit too. They\r\nexecuted the will, and the other chap inherited, and directly he was\r\none-and-twenty he began to blew it. How he did blew it, to be sure! He\r\nbet, he drank, he got in the papers for this and that. I tell you, it\r\nmakes me wriggle to think of the times he had. He blewed every ha'penny\r\nof it before he was thirty, and the last I heard of him was--Holloway!\r\nThree years ago.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I naturally fell on hard times, because, as you see, the only\r\ntrade I knew was legacy-cadging. All my plans were waiting over to\r\nbegin, so to speak, when the old chap died. I've had my ups and downs\r\nsince then. Just now it's a period of depression. I tell you frankly,\r\nI'm on the look-out for help. I was hunting round my room to find\r\nsomething to raise a bit on for immediate necessities, and the sight\r\nof all those presentation volumes--no one will buy them, not to wrap\r\nbutter in, even--well, they annoyed me. I'd promised him not to part\r\nwith them, and I never kept a promise easier. I let out at them with my\r\nboot, and sent them shooting across the room. One lifted at the kick,\r\nand spun through the air. And out of it flapped--You guess?\r\n\r\n\"It was the will. He'd given it me himself in that very last volume of\r\nall.\"\r\n\r\nHe folded his arms on the table, and looked sadly with the active eye\r\nat his empty tankard. He shook his head slowly, and said softly, \"I'd\r\nnever _opened_ the book, much more cut a page!\" Then he looked up, with\r\na bitter laugh, for my sympathy. \"Fancy hiding it there! Eigh? Of all\r\nplaces.\"\r\n\r\nHe began to fish absently for a dead fly with his finger. \"It just\r\nshows you the vanity of authors,\" he said, looking up at me. \"It wasn't\r\nno trick of his. He'd meant perfectly fair. He'd really thought I was\r\nreally going home to read that blessed book of his through. But it\r\nshows you, don't it?\"--his eye went down to the tankard again,--\"It\r\nshows you, too, how we poor human beings fail to understand one\r\nanother.\"\r\n\r\nBut there was no misunderstanding the eloquent thirst of his eye.\r\nHe accepted with ill-feigned surprise. He said, in the usual subtle\r\nformula, that he didn't mind if he did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SAD STORY OF A DRAMATIC CRITIC\r\n\r\n\r\nI was--you shall hear immediately why I am not now--Egbert Craddock\r\nCummins. The name remains. I am still (Heaven help me!) Dramatic Critic\r\nto the _Fiery Cross_. What I shall be in a little while I do not know.\r\nI write in great trouble and confusion of mind. I will do what I can\r\nto make myself clear in the face of terrible difficulties. You must\r\nbear with me a little. When a man is rapidly losing his own identity,\r\nhe naturally finds a difficulty in expressing himself. I will make it\r\nperfectly plain in a minute, when once I get my grip upon the story.\r\nLet me see--where _am_ I? I wish I knew. Ah, I have it! Dead self!\r\nEgbert Craddock Cummins!\r\n\r\nIn the past I should have disliked writing anything quite so full of\r\n\"I\" as this story must be. It is full of \"I's\" before and behind, like\r\nthe beast in Revelation--the one with a head like a calf, I am afraid.\r\nBut my tastes have changed since I became a Dramatic Critic and studied\r\nthe masters--G.R.S., G.B.S., G.A.S., and the others. Everything has\r\nchanged since then. At least the story is about myself--so that there\r\nis some excuse for me. And it is really not egotism, because, as I\r\nsay, since those days my identity has undergone an entire alteration.\r\n\r\nThat past!... I was--in those days--rather a nice fellow, rather\r\nshy--taste for grey in my clothes, weedy little moustache, face\r\n\"interesting,\" slight stutter which I had caught in early life from\r\na schoolfellow. Engaged to a very nice girl, named Delia. Fairly\r\nnew, she was--cigarettes--liked me because I was human and original.\r\nConsidered I was like Lamb--on the strength of the stutter, I believe.\r\nFather, an eminent authority on postage stamps. She read a great\r\ndeal in the British Museum. (A perfect pairing ground for literary\r\npeople, that British Museum--you should read George Egerton and Justin\r\nHuntly M'Carthy and Gissing and the rest of them.) We loved in our\r\nintellectual way, and shared the brightest hopes. (All gone now.) And\r\nher father liked me because I seemed honestly eager to hear about\r\nstamps. She had no mother. Indeed, I had the happiest prospects a\r\nyoung man could have. I never went to theatres in those days. My Aunt\r\nCharlotte before she died had told me not to.\r\n\r\nThen Barnaby, the editor of the _Fiery Cross_, made me--in spite\r\nof my spasmodic efforts to escape--Dramatic Critic. He is a fine,\r\nhealthy man, Barnaby, with an enormous head of frizzy black hair and\r\na convincing manner, and he caught me on the staircase going to see\r\nWembly. He had been dining, and was more than usually buoyant. \"Hullo,\r\nCummins!\" he said. \"The very man I want!\" He caught me by the shoulder\r\nor the collar or something, ran me up the little passage, and flung me\r\nover the waste-paper basket into the arm-chair in his office. \"Pray be\r\nseated,\" he said, as he did so. Then he ran across the room and came\r\nback with some pink and yellow tickets and pushed them into my hand.\r\n\"Opera Comique,\" he said, \"Thursday; Friday, the Surrey; Saturday, the\r\nFrivolity. That's all, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\"But\"--I began.\r\n\r\n\"Glad you're free,\" he said, snatching some proofs off the desk and\r\nbeginning to read.\r\n\r\n\"I don't quite understand,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"_Eigh?_\" he said, at the top of his voice, as though he thought I had\r\ngone, and was startled at my remark.\r\n\r\n\"Do you want me to criticise these plays?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do something with 'em.... Did you think it was a treat?\"\r\n\r\n\"But I can't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you call me a fool?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I've never been to a theatre in my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Virgin soil.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I don't know anything about it, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's just it. New view. No habits. No _clichés_ in stock. Ours is a\r\nlive paper, not a bag of tricks. None of your clockwork professional\r\njournalism in this office. And I can rely on your integrity\"--\r\n\r\n\"But I've conscientious scruples\"--\r\n\r\nHe caught me up suddenly and put me outside his door. \"Go and talk to\r\nWembly about that,\" he said. \"He'll explain.\"\r\n\r\nAs I stood perplexed, he opened the door again, said, \"I forgot this,\"\r\nthrust a fourth ticket into my hand (it was for that night--in twenty\r\nminutes' time), and slammed the door upon me. His expression was quite\r\ncalm, but I caught his eye.\r\n\r\nI hate arguments. I decided that I would take his hint and become (to\r\nmy own destruction) a Dramatic Critic. I walked slowly down the passage\r\nto Wembly. That Barnaby has a remarkably persuasive way. He has made\r\nfew suggestions during our very pleasant intercourse of four years\r\nthat he has not ultimately won me round to adopting. It may be, of\r\ncourse, that I am of a yielding disposition; certainly I am too apt to\r\ntake my colour from my circumstances. It is, indeed, to my unfortunate\r\nsusceptibility to vivid impressions that all my misfortunes are due.\r\nI have already alluded to the slight stammer I had acquired from a\r\nschoolfellow in my youth. However, this is a digression.... I went home\r\nin a cab to dress.\r\n\r\nI will not trouble the reader with my thoughts about the first-night\r\naudience, strange assembly as it is,--those I reserve for my\r\nMemoirs,--nor the humiliating story of how I got lost during the\r\n_entr'acte_ in a lot of red plush passages, and saw the third act from\r\nthe gallery. The only point upon which I wish to lay stress was the\r\nremarkable effect of the acting upon me. You must remember I had lived\r\na quiet and retired life, and had never been to the theatre before,\r\nand that I am extremely sensitive to vivid impressions. At the risk of\r\nrepetition I must insist upon these points.\r\n\r\nThe first effect was a profound amazement, not untinctured by alarm.\r\nThe phenomenal unnaturalness of acting is a thing discounted in the\r\nminds of most people by early visits to the theatre. They get used to\r\nthe fantastic gestures, the flamboyant emotions, the weird mouthings,\r\nmelodious snortings, agonising yelps, lip-gnawings, glaring horrors,\r\nand other emotional symbolism of the stage. It becomes at last a mere\r\ndeaf-and-dumb language to them, which they read intelligently _pari\r\npassu_ with the hearing of the dialogue. But all this was new to me.\r\nThe thing was called a modern comedy, the people were supposed to be\r\nEnglish and were dressed like fashionable Americans of the current\r\nepoch, and I fell into the natural error of supposing that the actors\r\nwere trying to represent human beings. I looked round on my first-night\r\naudience with a kind of wonder, discovered--as all new Dramatic Critics\r\ndo--that it rested with me to reform the Drama, and, after a supper\r\nchoked with emotion, went off to the office to write a column, piebald\r\nwith \"new paragraphs\" (as all my stuff is--it fills out so) and purple\r\nwith indignation. Barnaby was delighted.\r\n\r\nBut I could not sleep that night. I dreamt of actors--actors glaring,\r\nactors smiting their chests, actors flinging out a handful of extended\r\nfingers, actors smiling bitterly, laughing despairingly, falling\r\nhopelessly, dying idiotically. I got up at eleven with a slight\r\nheadache, read my notice in the _Fiery Cross_, breakfasted, and went\r\nback to my room to shave. (It's my habit to do so.) Then an odd thing\r\nhappened. I could not find my razor. Suddenly it occurred to me that I\r\nhad not unpacked it the day before.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said I, in front of the looking-glass. Then \"Hullo!\"\r\n\r\nQuite involuntarily, when I had thought of my portmanteau, I had flung\r\nup the left arm (fingers fully extended) and clutched at my diaphragm\r\nwith my right hand. I am an acutely self-conscious man at all times.\r\nThe gesture struck me as absolutely novel for me. I repeated it, for\r\nmy own satisfaction. \"Odd!\" Then (rather puzzled) I turned to my\r\nportmanteau.\r\n\r\nAfter shaving, my mind reverted to the acting I had seen, and I\r\nentertained myself before the cheval glass with some imitations of\r\nJafferay's more exaggerated gestures. \"Really, one might think it a\r\ndisease,\" I said--\"Stage-Walkitis!\" (There's many a truth spoken in\r\njest.) Then, if I remember rightly, I went off to see Wembly, and\r\nafterwards lunched at the British Museum with Delia. We actually spoke\r\nabout our prospects, in the light of my new appointment.\r\n\r\nBut that appointment was the beginning of my downfall. From that day\r\nI necessarily became a persistent theatre-goer, and almost insensibly\r\nI began to change. The next thing I noticed after the gesture about\r\nthe razor, was to catch myself bowing ineffably when I met Delia, and\r\nstooping in an old-fashioned, courtly way over her hand. Directly I\r\ncaught myself, I straightened myself up and became very uncomfortable.\r\nI remember she looked at me curiously. Then, in the office, I found\r\nmyself doing \"nervous business,\" fingers on teeth, when Barnaby asked\r\nme a question I could not very well answer. Then, in some trifling\r\ndifference with Delia, I clasped my hand to my brow. And I pranced\r\nthrough my social transactions at times singularly like an actor! I\r\ntried not to--no one could be more keenly alive to the arrant absurdity\r\nof the histrionic bearing. And I did!\r\n\r\nIt began to dawn on me what it all meant. The acting, I saw, was too\r\nmuch for my delicately-strung nervous system. I have always, I know,\r\nbeen too amenable to the suggestions of my circumstances. Night after\r\nnight of concentrated attention to the conventional attitudes and\r\nintonation of the English stage was gradually affecting my speech and\r\ncarriage. I was giving way to the infection of sympathetic imitation.\r\nNight after night my plastic nervous system took the print of some new\r\namazing gesture, some new emotional exaggeration--and retained it. A\r\nkind of theatrical veneer threatened to plate over and obliterate my\r\nprivate individuality altogether. I saw myself in a kind of vision.\r\nSitting by myself one night, my new self seemed to me to glide,\r\nposing and gesticulating, across the room. He clutched his throat, he\r\nopened his fingers, he opened his legs in walking like a high-class\r\nmarionette. He went from attitude to attitude. He might have been\r\nclockwork. Directly after this I made an ineffectual attempt to\r\nresign my theatrical work. But Barnaby persisted in talking about the\r\nPolywhiddle Divorce all the time I was with him, and I could get no\r\nopportunity of saying what I wished.\r\n\r\nAnd then Delia's manner began to change towards me. The ease of our\r\nintercourse vanished. I felt she was learning to dislike me. I\r\ngrinned, and capered, and scowled, and posed at her in a thousand ways,\r\nand knew--with what a voiceless agony!--that I did it all the time. I\r\ntried to resign again, and Barnaby talked about \"X\" and \"Z\" and \"Y\" in\r\nthe _New Review_, and gave me a strong cigar to smoke, and so routed\r\nme. And then I walked up the Assyrian Gallery in the manner of Irving\r\nto meet Delia, and so precipitated the crisis.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!--_Dear!_\" I said, with more sprightliness and emotion in my voice\r\nthan had ever been in all my life before I became (to my own undoing) a\r\nDramatic Critic.\r\n\r\nShe held out her hand rather coldly, scrutinising my face as she did\r\nso. I prepared, with a new-won grace, to walk by her side.\r\n\r\n\"Egbert,\" she said, standing still, and thought. Then she looked at me.\r\n\r\nI said nothing. I felt what was coming. I tried to be the old Egbert\r\nCraddock Cummins of shambling gait and stammering sincerity, whom she\r\nloved, but I felt even as I did so that I was a new thing, a thing\r\nof surging emotions and mysterious fixity--like no human being that\r\never lived, except upon the stage. \"Egbert,\" she said, \"you are not\r\nyourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" Involuntarily I clutched my diaphragm and averted my head (as is\r\nthe way with them).\r\n\r\n\"There!\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"_What do you mean?_\" I said, whispering in vocal italics--you know\r\nhow they do it--turning on her, perplexity on face, right hand down,\r\nleft on brow. I knew quite well what she meant. I knew quite well the\r\ndramatic unreality of my behaviour. But I struggled against it in vain.\r\n\"What do you mean?\" I said, and, in a kind of hoarse whisper, \"I don't\r\nunderstand!\"\r\n\r\nShe really looked as though she disliked me. \"What do you keep on\r\nposing for?\" she said. \"I don't like it. You didn't use to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't use to!\" I said slowly, repeating this twice. I glared up and\r\ndown the gallery, with short, sharp glances. \"We are alone,\" I said\r\nswiftly. \"_Listen!_\" I poked my forefinger towards her, and glared at\r\nher. \"I am under a curse.\"\r\n\r\nI saw her hand tighten upon her sunshade. \"You are under some bad\r\ninfluence or other,\" said Delia. \"You should give it up. I never knew\r\nanyone change as you have done.\"\r\n\r\n\"Delia!\" I said, lapsing into the pathetic. \"Pity me. Augh! Delia!\r\n_Pit_--y me!\"\r\n\r\nShe eyed me critically. \"_Why_ you keep playing the fool like this I\r\ndon't know,\" she said. \"Anyhow, I really cannot go about with a man who\r\nbehaves as you do. You made us both ridiculous on Wednesday. Frankly,\r\nI dislike you, as you are now. I met you here to tell you so--as it's\r\nabout the only place where we can be sure of being alone together\"--\r\n\r\n\"Delia!\" said I, with intensity, knuckles of clenched hands white. \"You\r\ndon't mean\"--\r\n\r\n\"I do,\" said Delia. \"A woman's lot is sad enough at the best of times.\r\nBut with you\"--\r\n\r\nI clapped my hand on my brow.\r\n\r\n\"So, good-bye,\" said Delia, without emotion.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Delia!\" I said. \"Not _this_?\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye, Mr. Cummins,\" she said.\r\n\r\nBy a violent effort I controlled myself and touched her hand. I tried\r\nto say some word of explanation to her. She looked into my working face\r\nand winced. \"I _must_ do it,\" she said hopelessly. Then she turned from\r\nme and began walking rapidly down the gallery.\r\n\r\nHeavens! How the human agony cried within me! I loved Delia. But\r\nnothing found expression--I was already too deeply crusted with my\r\nacquired self.\r\n\r\n\"Good-baye!\" I said at last, watching her retreating figure. How I\r\nhated myself for doing it! After she had vanished, I repeated in a\r\ndreamy way, \"Good-baye!\" looking hopelessly round me. Then, with a kind\r\nof heart-broken cry, I shook my clenched fists in the air, staggered to\r\nthe pedestal of a winged figure, buried my face in my arms, and made my\r\nshoulders heave. Something within me said \"Ass!\" as I did so. (I had\r\nthe greatest difficulty in persuading the Museum policeman, who was\r\nattracted by my cry of agony, that I was not intoxicated, but merely\r\nsuffering from a transient indisposition.)\r\n\r\nBut even this great sorrow has not availed to save me from my fate.\r\nI see it, everyone sees it; I grow more \"theatrical\" every day.\r\nAnd no one could be more painfully aware of the pungent silliness\r\nof theatrical ways. The quiet, nervous, but pleasing E. C. Cummins\r\nvanishes. I cannot save him. I am driven like a dead leaf before the\r\nwinds of March. My tailor even enters into the spirit of my disorder.\r\nHe has a peculiar sense of what is fitting. I tried to get a dull grey\r\nsuit from him this spring, and he foisted a brilliant blue upon me,\r\nand I see he has put braid down the sides of my new dress trousers. My\r\nhairdresser insists upon giving me a \"wave.\"\r\n\r\nI am beginning to associate with actors. I detest them, but it is only\r\nin their company that I can feel I am not glaringly conspicuous. Their\r\ntalk infects me. I notice a growing tendency to dramatic brevity, to\r\ndashes and pauses in my style, to a punctuation of bows and attitudes.\r\nBarnaby has remarked it too. I offended Wembly by calling him \"Dear\r\nBoy\" yesterday. I dread the end, but I cannot escape from it.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, I am being obliterated. Living a grey, retired life all\r\nmy youth, I came to the theatre a delicate sketch of a man, a thing\r\nof tints and faint lines. Their gorgeous colouring has effaced me\r\naltogether. People forget how much mode of expression, method of\r\nmovement, are a matter of contagion. I have heard of stage-struck\r\npeople before, and thought it a figure of speech. I spoke of it\r\njestingly, as a disease. It is no jest. It _is_ a disease. And I have\r\ngot it bad! Deep down within me I protest against the wrong done to my\r\npersonality--unavailingly. For three hours or more a week I have to go\r\nand concentrate my attention on some fresh play, and the suggestions\r\nof the drama strengthen their awful hold upon me. My manners grow so\r\nflamboyant, my passions so professional, that I doubt, as I said at the\r\noutset, whether it is really myself that behaves in such a manner. I\r\nfeel merely the core to this dramatic casing, that grows thicker and\r\npresses upon me--me and mine. I feel like King John's abbot in his cope\r\nof lead.\r\n\r\nI doubt, indeed, whether I should not abandon the struggle\r\naltogether--leave this sad world of ordinary life for which I am\r\nso ill-fitted, abandon the name of Cummins for some professional\r\npseudonym, complete my self-effacement, and--a thing of tricks and\r\ntatters, of posing and pretence--go upon the stage. It seems my only\r\nresort--\"to hold the mirror up to Nature.\" For in the ordinary life,\r\nI will confess, no one now seems to regard me as both sane and sober.\r\nOnly upon the stage, I feel convinced, will people take me seriously.\r\nThat will be the end of it. I _know_ that will be the end of it. And\r\nyet ... I will frankly confess ... all that marks off your actor\r\nfrom your common man ... I _detest_. I am still largely of my Aunt\r\nCharlotte's opinion, that playacting is unworthy of a pure-minded man's\r\nattention, much more participation. Even now I would resign my dramatic\r\ncriticism and try a rest. Only I can't get hold of Barnaby. Letters\r\nof resignation he never notices. He says it is against the etiquette\r\nof journalism to write to your Editor. And when I go to see him, he\r\ngives me another big cigar and some strong whisky and soda, and then\r\nsomething always turns up to prevent my explanation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SLIP UNDER THE MICROSCOPE\r\n\r\n\r\nOutside the laboratory windows was a watery-grey fog, and within\r\na close warmth and the yellow light of the green-shaded gas lamps\r\nthat stood two to each table down its narrow length. On each table\r\nstood a couple of glass jars containing the mangled vestiges of the\r\ncrayfish, mussels, frogs, and guineapigs, upon which the students had\r\nbeen working, and down the side of the room, facing the windows, were\r\nshelves bearing bleached dissections in spirits, surmounted by a row\r\nof beautifully executed anatomical drawings in whitewood frames and\r\noverhanging a row of cubical lockers. All the doors of the laboratory\r\nwere panelled with blackboard, and on these were the half-erased\r\ndiagrams of the previous day's work. The laboratory was empty, save for\r\nthe demonstrator, who sat near the preparation-room door, and silent,\r\nsave for a low, continuous murmur, and the clicking of the rocker\r\nmicrotome at which he was working. But scattered about the room were\r\ntraces of numerous students: hand-bags, polished boxes of instruments,\r\nin one place a large drawing covered by newspaper, and in another a\r\nprettily bound copy of _News from Nowhere_, a book oddly at variance\r\nwith its surroundings. These things had been put down hastily as the\r\nstudents had arrived and hurried at once to secure their seats in the\r\nadjacent lecture theatre. Deadened by the closed door, the measured\r\naccents of the professor sounded as a featureless muttering.\r\n\r\nPresently, faint through the closed windows came the sound of the\r\nOratory clock striking the hour of eleven. The clicking of the\r\nmicrotome ceased, and the demonstrator looked at his watch, rose,\r\nthrust his hands into his pockets, and walked slowly down the\r\nlaboratory towards the lecture theatre door. He stood listening for a\r\nmoment, and then his eye fell on the little volume by William Morris.\r\nHe picked it up, glanced at the title, smiled, opened it, looked at the\r\nname on the fly-leaf, ran the leaves through with his hand, and put\r\nit down. Almost immediately the even murmur of the lecturer ceased,\r\nthere was a sudden burst of pencils rattling on the desks in the\r\nlecture theatre, a stirring, a scraping of feet, and a number of voices\r\nspeaking together. Then a firm footfall approached the door, which\r\nbegan to open, and stood ajar, as some indistinctly heard question\r\narrested the new-comer.\r\n\r\nThe demonstrator turned, walked slowly back past the microtome, and\r\nleft the laboratory by the preparation-room door. As he did so,\r\nfirst one, and then several students carrying notebooks entered the\r\nlaboratory from the lecture theatre, and distributed themselves among\r\nthe little tables, or stood in a group about the doorway. They were an\r\nexceptionally heterogeneous assembly, for while Oxford and Cambridge\r\nstill recoil from the blushing prospect of mixed classes, the College\r\nof Science anticipated America in the matter years ago--mixed socially,\r\ntoo, for the prestige of the College is high, and its scholarships,\r\nfree of any age limit, dredge deeper even than do those of the Scotch\r\nuniversities. The class numbered one-and-twenty, but some remained in\r\nthe theatre questioning the professor, copying the blackboard diagrams\r\nbefore they were washed off, or examining the special specimens he had\r\nproduced to illustrate the day's teaching. Of the nine who had come\r\ninto the laboratory three were girls, one of whom, a little fair woman,\r\nwearing spectacles and dressed in greyish-green, was peering out of\r\nthe window at the fog, while the other two, both wholesome-looking,\r\nplain-faced schoolgirls, unrolled and put on the brown holland aprons\r\nthey wore while dissecting. Of the men, two went down the laboratory\r\nto their places, one a pallid, dark-bearded man, who had once been\r\na tailor; the other a pleasant-featured, ruddy young man of twenty,\r\ndressed in a well-fitting brown suit; young Wedderburn, the son of\r\nWedderburn the eye specialist. The others formed a little knot near\r\nthe theatre door. One of these, a dwarfed, spectacled figure, with\r\na hunch back, sat on a bent wood stool; two others, one a short,\r\ndark youngster, and the other a flaxen-haired, reddish-complexioned\r\nyoung man, stood leaning side by side against the slate sink, while\r\nthe fourth stood facing them, and maintained the larger share of the\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nThis last person was named Hill. He was a sturdily built young fellow,\r\nof the same age as Wedderburn; he had a white face, dark grey eyes,\r\nhair of an indeterminate colour, and prominent, irregular features.\r\nHe talked rather louder than was needful, and thrust his hands deeply\r\ninto his pockets. His collar was frayed and blue with the starch of a\r\ncareless laundress, his clothes were evidently readymade, and there\r\nwas a patch on the side of his boot near the toe. And as he talked\r\nor listened to the others, he glanced now and again towards the\r\nlecture theatre door. They were discussing the depressing peroration\r\nof the lecture they had just heard, the last lecture it was in the\r\nintroductory course in zoology. \"From ovum to ovum is the goal of the\r\nhigher vertebrata,\" the lecturer had said in his melancholy tones,\r\nand so had neatly rounded off the sketch of comparative anatomy he\r\nhad been developing. The spectacled hunchback had repeated it, with\r\nnoisy appreciation, had tossed it towards the fair-haired student with\r\nan evident provocation, and had started one of those vague, rambling\r\ndiscussions on generalities, so unaccountably dear to the student mind\r\nall the world over.\r\n\r\n\"That is our goal, perhaps--I admit it--as far as science goes,\" said\r\nthe fair-haired student, rising to the challenge. \"But there are things\r\nabove science.\"\r\n\r\n\"Science,\" said Hill confidently, \"is systematic knowledge. Ideas that\r\ndon't come into the system--must anyhow--be loose ideas.\" He was not\r\nquite sure whether that was a clever saying or a fatuity until his\r\nhearers took it seriously.\r\n\r\n\"The thing I cannot understand,\" said the hunchback, at large, \"is\r\nwhether Hill is a materialist or not.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is one thing above matter,\" said Hill promptly, feeling he had\r\na better thing this time, aware, too, of someone in the doorway behind\r\nhim, and raising his voice a trifle for her benefit, \"and that is, the\r\ndelusion that there is something above matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"So we have your gospel at last,\" said the fair student. \"It's all\r\na delusion, is it? All our aspirations to lead something more than\r\ndogs' lives, all our work for anything beyond ourselves. But see how\r\ninconsistent you are. Your socialism, for instance. Why do you trouble\r\nabout the interests of the race? Why do you concern yourself about\r\nthe beggar in the gutter? Why are you bothering yourself to lend that\r\nbook\"--he indicated William Morris by a movement of the head--\"to\r\neveryone in the lab.?\"\r\n\r\n\"Girl,\" said the hunchback indistinctly, and glanced guiltily over his\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\nThe girl in brown, with the brown eyes, had come into the laboratory,\r\nand stood on the other side of the table behind him, with her rolled-up\r\napron in one hand, looking over her shoulder, listening to the\r\ndiscussion. She did not notice the hunchback, because she was glancing\r\nfrom Hill to his interlocutor. Hill's consciousness of her presence\r\nbetrayed itself to her only in his studious ignorance of the fact; but\r\nshe understood that, and it pleased her. \"I see no reason,\" said he,\r\n\"why a man should live like a brute because he knows of nothing beyond\r\nmatter, and does not expect to exist a hundred years hence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why shouldn't he?\" said the fair-haired student.\r\n\r\n\"Why _should_ he?\" said Hill.\r\n\r\n\"What inducement has he?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the way with all you religious people. It's all a business of\r\ninducements. Cannot a man seek after righteousness for righteousness'\r\nsake?\"\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. The fair man answered, with a kind of vocal padding,\r\n\"But--you see--inducement--when I said inducement,\" to gain time. And\r\nthen the hunchback came to his rescue and inserted a question. He was\r\na terrible person in the debating society with his questions, and they\r\ninvariably took one form--a demand for a definition. \"What's your\r\ndefinition of righteousness?\" said the hunchback at this stage.\r\n\r\nHill experienced a sudden loss of complacency at this question,\r\nbut even as it was asked, relief came in the person of Brooks, the\r\nlaboratory attendant, who entered by the preparation-room door,\r\ncarrying a number of freshly killed guineapigs by their hind legs.\r\n\"This is the last batch of material this session,\" said the youngster,\r\nwho had not previously spoken. Brooks advanced up the laboratory,\r\nsmacking down a couple of guineapigs at each table. The rest of the\r\nclass, scenting the prey from afar, came crowding in by the lecture\r\ntheatre door, and the discussion perished abruptly as the students who\r\nwere not already in their places hurried to them to secure the choice\r\nof a specimen. There was a noise of keys rattling on split rings as\r\nlockers were opened and dissecting instruments taken out. Hill was\r\nalready standing by his table, and his box of scalpels was sticking out\r\nof his pocket. The girl in brown came a step towards him, and, leaning\r\nover his table, said softly, \"Did you see that I returned your book,\r\nMr. Hill?\"\r\n\r\nDuring the whole scene she and the book had been vividly present in his\r\nconsciousness; but he made a clumsy pretence of looking at the book and\r\nseeing it for the first time. \"Oh yes,\" he said, taking it up. \"I see.\r\nDid you like it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I want to ask you some questions about it--some time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" said Hill. \"I shall be glad.\" He stopped awkwardly. \"You\r\nliked it?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"It's a wonderful book. Only some things I don't understand.\"\r\n\r\nThen suddenly the laboratory was hushed by a curious braying noise. It\r\nwas the demonstrator. He was at the blackboard ready to begin the day's\r\ninstruction, and it was his custom to demand silence by a sound midway\r\nbetween the \"Er\" of common intercourse and the blast of a trumpet. The\r\ngirl in brown slipped back to her place: it was immediately in front\r\nof Hill's, and Hill, forgetting her forthwith, took a notebook out of\r\nthe drawer of his table, turned over its leaves hastily, drew a stumpy\r\npencil from his pocket, and prepared to make a copious note of the\r\ncoming demonstration. For demonstrations and lectures are the sacred\r\ntext of the College students. Books, saving only the Professor's own,\r\nyou may--it is even expedient to--ignore.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHill was the son of a Landport cobbler, and had been hooked by a chance\r\nblue paper the authorities had thrown out to the Landport Technical\r\nCollege. He kept himself in London on his allowance of a guinea a\r\nweek, and found that, with proper care, this also covered his clothing\r\nallowance, an occasional waterproof collar, that is; and ink and\r\nneedles and cotton, and such-like necessaries for a man about town.\r\nThis was his first year and his first session, but the brown old man\r\nin Landport had already got himself detested in many public-houses by\r\nboasting of his son, \"the Professor.\" Hill was a vigorous youngster,\r\nwith a serene contempt for the clergy of all denominations, and a\r\nfine ambition to reconstruct the world. He regarded his scholarship\r\nas a brilliant opportunity. He had begun to read at seven, and had\r\nread steadily whatever came in his way, good or bad, since then. His\r\nworldly experience had been limited to the island of Portsea, and\r\nacquired chiefly in the wholesale boot factory in which he had worked\r\nby day, after passing the seventh standard of the Board school. He had\r\na considerable gift of speech, as the College Debating Society, which\r\nmet amidst the crushing machines and mine models in the metallurgical\r\ntheatre downstairs, already recognised--recognised by a violent\r\nbattering of desks whenever he rose. And he was just at that fine\r\nemotional age when life opens at the end of a narrow pass like a broad\r\nvalley at one's feet, full of the promise of wonderful discoveries and\r\ntremendous achievements. And his own limitations, save that he knew\r\nthat he knew neither Latin nor French, were all unknown to him.\r\n\r\nAt first his interest had been divided pretty equally between his\r\nbiological work at the College and social and theological theorising,\r\nan employment which he took in deadly earnest. Of a night, when the\r\nbig museum library was not open, he would sit on the bed of his room\r\nin Chelsea with his coat and a muffler on, and write out the lecture\r\nnotes and revise his dissection memoranda, until Thorpe called him\r\nout by a whistle,--the landlady objected to open the door to attic\r\nvisitors,--and then the two would go prowling about the shadowy, shiny,\r\ngas-lit streets, talking, very much in the fashion of the sample\r\njust given, of the God Idea, and Righteousness, and Carlyle, and the\r\nReorganisation of Society. And, in the midst of it all, Hill, arguing\r\nnot only for Thorpe, but for the casual passer-by, would lose the\r\nthread of his argument glancing at some pretty painted face that looked\r\nmeaningly at him as he passed. Science and Righteousness! But once or\r\ntwice lately there had been signs that a third interest was creeping\r\ninto his life, and he had found his attention wandering from the fate\r\nof the mesoblastic somites or the probable meaning of the blastopore,\r\nto the thought of the girl with the brown eyes who sat at the table\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\nShe was a paying student; she descended inconceivable social altitudes\r\nto speak to him. At the thought of the education she must have had,\r\nand the accomplishments she must possess, the soul of Hill became\r\nabject within him. She had spoken to him first over a difficulty about\r\nthe alisphenoid of a rabbit's skull, and he had found that, in biology\r\nat least, he had no reason for self-abasement. And from that, after\r\nthe manner of young people starting from any starting-point, they got\r\nto generalities, and while Hill attacked her upon the question of\r\nsocialism,--some instinct told him to spare her a direct assault upon\r\nher religion,--she was gathering resolution to undertake what she told\r\nherself was his æsthetic education. She was a year or two older than\r\nhe, though the thought never occurred to him. The loan of _News from\r\nNowhere_ was the beginning of a series of cross loans. Upon some absurd\r\nfirst principle of his, Hill had never \"wasted time\" upon poetry,\r\nand it seemed an appalling deficiency to her. One day in the lunch\r\nhour, when she chanced upon him alone in the little museum where the\r\nskeletons were arranged, shamefully eating the bun that constituted\r\nhis midday meal, she retreated, and returned to lend him, with a\r\nslightly furtive air, a volume of Browning. He stood sideways towards\r\nher and took the book rather clumsily, because he was holding the bun\r\nin the other hand. And in the retrospect his voice lacked the cheerful\r\nclearness he could have wished.\r\n\r\nThat occurred after the examination in comparative anatomy, on the\r\nday before the College turned out its students, and was carefully\r\nlocked up by the officials, for the Christmas holidays. The excitement\r\nof cramming for the first trial of strength had for a little while\r\ndominated Hill, to the exclusion of his other interests. In the\r\nforecasts of the result in which everyone indulged, he was surprised\r\nto find that no one regarded him as a possible competitor for the\r\nHarvey Commemoration Medal, of which this and the two subsequent\r\nexaminations disposed. It was about this time that Wedderburn, who\r\nso far had lived inconspicuously on the uttermost margin of Hill's\r\nperceptions, began to take on the appearance of an obstacle. By a\r\nmutual agreement, the nocturnal prowlings with Thorpe ceased for the\r\nthree weeks before the examination, and his landlady pointed out that\r\nshe really could not supply so much lamp oil at the price. He walked to\r\nand fro from the College with little slips of mnemonics in his hand,\r\nlists of crayfish appendages, rabbits' skull-bones, and vertebrate\r\nnerves, for example, and became a positive nuisance to foot passengers\r\nin the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nBut, by a natural reaction, Poetry and the girl with the brown eyes\r\nruled the Christmas holiday. The pending results of the examination\r\nbecame such a secondary consideration that Hill marvelled at his\r\nfather's excitement. Even had he wished it, there was no comparative\r\nanatomy to read in Landport, and he was too poor to buy books, but the\r\nstock of poets in the library was extensive, and Hill's attack was\r\nmagnificently sustained. He saturated himself with the fluent numbers\r\nof Longfellow and Tennyson, and fortified himself with Shakespeare;\r\nfound a kindred soul in Pope, and a master in Shelley, and heard and\r\nfled the siren voices of Eliza Cook and Mrs. Hemans. But he read no\r\nmore Browning, because he hoped for the loan of other volumes from Miss\r\nHaysman when he returned to London.\r\n\r\nHe walked from his lodgings to the College with that volume of Browning\r\nin his shiny black bag, and his mind teeming with the finest general\r\npropositions about poetry. Indeed, he framed first this little speech\r\nand then that with which to grace the return. The morning was an\r\nexceptionally pleasant one for London; there was a clear, hard frost\r\nand undeniable blue in the sky, a thin haze softened every outline, and\r\nwarm shafts of sunlight struck between the house blocks and turned the\r\nsunny side of the street to amber and gold. In the hall of the College\r\nhe pulled off his glove and signed his name with fingers so stiff with\r\ncold that the characteristic dash under the signature he cultivated\r\nbecame a quivering line. He imagined Miss Haysman about him everywhere.\r\nHe turned at the staircase, and there, below, he saw a crowd struggling\r\nat the foot of the notice-board. This, possibly, was the biology list.\r\nHe forgot Browning and Miss Haysman for the moment, and joined the\r\nscrimmage. And at last, with his cheek flattened against the sleeve of\r\nthe man on the step above him, he read the list--\r\n\r\n                      CLASS I\r\n\r\n              H. J. Somers Wedderburn\r\n              William Hill\r\n\r\nand thereafter followed a second class that is outside our present\r\nsympathies. It was characteristic that he did not trouble to look for\r\nThorpe on the physics list, but backed out of the struggle at once, and\r\nin a curious emotional state between pride over common second-class\r\nhumanity and acute disappointment at Wedderburn's success, went on his\r\nway upstairs. At the top, as he was hanging up his coat in the passage,\r\nthe zoological demonstrator, a young man from Oxford, who secretly\r\nregarded him as a blatant \"mugger\" of the very worst type, offered his\r\nheartiest congratulations.\r\n\r\nAt the laboratory door Hill stopped for a second to get his breath,\r\nand then entered. He looked straight up the laboratory and saw all\r\nfive girl students grouped in their places, and Wedderburn, the once\r\nretiring Wedderburn, leaning rather gracefully against the window,\r\nplaying with the blind tassel and talking, apparently, to the five\r\nof them. Now, Hill could talk bravely enough and even overbearingly\r\nto one girl, and he could have made a speech to a roomful of girls,\r\nbut this business of standing at ease and appreciating, fencing, and\r\nreturning quick remarks round a group was, he knew, altogether beyond\r\nhim. Coming up the staircase his feelings for Wedderburn had been\r\ngenerous, a certain admiration perhaps, a willingness to shake his hand\r\nconspicuously and heartily as one who had fought but the first round.\r\nBut before Christmas Wedderburn had never gone up to that end of the\r\nroom to talk. In a flash Hill's mist of vague excitement condensed\r\nabruptly to a vivid dislike of Wedderburn. Possibly his expression\r\nchanged. As he came up to his place, Wedderburn nodded carelessly to\r\nhim, and the others glanced round. Miss Haysman looked at him and away\r\nagain, the faintest touch of her eyes. \"I can't agree with you, Mr.\r\nWedderburn,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"I must congratulate you on your first class, Mr. Hill,\" said the\r\nspectacled girl in green, turning round and beaming at him.\r\n\r\n\"It's nothing,\" said Hill, staring at Wedderburn and Miss Haysman\r\ntalking together, and eager to hear what they talked about.\r\n\r\n\"We poor folks in the second class don't think so,\" said the girl in\r\nspectacles.\r\n\r\nWhat was it Wedderburn was saying? Something about William Morris!\r\nHill did not answer the girl in spectacles, and the smile died out of\r\nhis face. He could not hear, and failed to see how he could \"cut in.\"\r\nConfound Wedderburn! He sat down, opened his bag, hesitated whether\r\nto return the volume of Browning forthwith, in the sight of all, and\r\ninstead drew out his new notebooks for the short course in elementary\r\nbotany that was now beginning, and which would terminate in February.\r\nAs he did so, a fat, heavy man, with a white face and pale grey eyes,\r\nBindon, the professor of botany, who came up from Kew for January and\r\nFebruary, came in by the lecture theatre door, and passed, rubbing his\r\nhands together and smiling, in silent affability down the laboratory.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the subsequent six weeks Hill experienced some very rapid and\r\ncuriously complex emotional developments. For the most part he had\r\nWedderburn in focus--a fact that Miss Haysman never suspected. She told\r\nHill (for in the comparative privacy of the museum she talked a good\r\ndeal to him of socialism and Browning and general propositions) that\r\nshe had met Wedderburn at the house of some people she knew, and \"he's\r\ninherited his cleverness; for his father, you know, is the great eye\r\nspecialist.\"\r\n\r\n\"_My_ father is a cobbler,\" said Hill, quite irrelevantly, and\r\nperceived the want of dignity even as he said it. But the gleam of\r\njealousy did not offend her. She conceived herself the fundamental\r\nsource of it. He suffered bitterly from a sense of Wedderburn's\r\nunfairness, and a realisation of his own handicap. Here was this\r\nWedderburn had picked up a prominent man for a father, and instead\r\nof his losing so many marks on the score of that advantage, it was\r\ncounted to him for righteousness! And while Hill had to introduce\r\nhimself and talk to Miss Haysman clumsily over mangled guineapigs in\r\nthe laboratory, this Wedderburn, in some backstairs way, had access to\r\nher social altitudes, and could converse in a polished argot that Hill\r\nunderstood perhaps, but felt incapable of speaking. Not, of course,\r\nthat he wanted to. Then it seemed to Hill that for Wedderburn to come\r\nthere day after day with cuffs unfrayed, neatly tailored, precisely\r\nbarbered, quietly perfect, was in itself an ill-bred, sneering sort\r\nof proceeding. Moreover, it was a stealthy thing for Wedderburn to\r\nbehave insignificantly for a space, to mock modesty, to lead Hill to\r\nfancy that he himself was beyond dispute the man of the year, and\r\nthen suddenly to dart in front of him, and incontinently to swell up\r\nin this fashion. In addition to these things, Wedderburn displayed an\r\nincreasing disposition to join in any conversational grouping that\r\nincluded Miss Haysman, and would venture, and indeed seek occasion, to\r\npass opinions derogatory to socialism and atheism. He goaded Hill to\r\nincivilities by neat, shallow, and exceedingly effective personalities\r\nabout the socialist leaders, until Hill hated Bernard Shaw's graceful\r\negotisms, William Morris's limited editions and luxurious wall-papers,\r\nand Walter Crane's charmingly absurd ideal working men, about as much\r\nas he hated Wedderburn. The dissertations in the laboratory, that had\r\nbeen his glory in the previous term, became a danger, degenerated into\r\ninglorious tussles with Wedderburn, and Hill kept to them only out of\r\nan obscure perception that his honour was involved. In the debating\r\nsociety Hill knew quite clearly that, to a thunderous accompaniment\r\nof banged desks, he could have pulverised Wedderburn. Only Wedderburn\r\nnever attended the debating society to be pulverised, because--nauseous\r\naffectation!--he \"dined late.\"\r\n\r\nYou must not imagine that these things presented themselves in quite\r\nsuch a crude form to Hill's perception. Hill was a born generaliser.\r\nWedderburn to him was not so much an individual obstacle as a type,\r\nthe salient angle of a class. The economic theories that, after\r\ninfinite ferment, had shaped themselves in Hill's mind, became abruptly\r\nconcrete at the contact. The world became full of easy-mannered,\r\ngraceful, gracefully-dressed, conversationally dexterous, finally\r\nshallow Wedderburns, Bishops Wedderburn, Wedderburn M.P.'s, Professors\r\nWedderburn, Wedderburn landlords, all with finger-bowl shibboleths and\r\nepigrammatic cities of refuge from a sturdy debater. And everyone\r\nill-clothed or ill-dressed, from the cobbler to the cab-runner, was a\r\nman and a brother, a fellow-sufferer, to Hill's imagination. So that\r\nhe became, as it were, a champion of the fallen and oppressed, albeit\r\nto outward seeming only a self-assertive, ill-mannered young man, and\r\nan unsuccessful champion at that. Again and again a skirmish over the\r\nafternoon tea that the girl students had inaugurated, left Hill with\r\nflushed cheeks and a tattered temper, and the debating society noticed\r\na new quality of sarcastic bitterness in his speeches.\r\n\r\nYou will understand now how it was necessary, if only in the interests\r\nof humanity, that Hill should demolish Wedderburn in the forthcoming\r\nexamination and outshine him in the eyes of Miss Haysman; and you\r\nwill perceive, too, how Miss Haysman fell into some common feminine\r\nmisconceptions. The Hill-Wedderburn quarrel, for in his unostentatious\r\nway Wedderburn reciprocated Hill's ill-veiled rivalry, became a tribute\r\nto her indefinable charm; she was the Queen of Beauty in a tournament\r\nof scalpels and stumpy pencils. To her confidential friend's secret\r\nannoyance, it even troubled her conscience, for she was a good girl,\r\nand painfully aware, from Ruskin and contemporary fiction, how entirely\r\nmen's activities are determined by women's attitudes. And if Hill never\r\nby any chance mentioned the topic of love to her, she only credited him\r\nwith the finer modesty for that omission.\r\n\r\nSo the time came on for the second examination, and Hill's increasing\r\npallor confirmed the general rumour that he was working hard. In the\r\naërated bread shop near South Kensington Station you would see him,\r\nbreaking his bun and sipping his milk, with his eyes intent upon a\r\npaper of closely written notes. In his bedroom there were propositions\r\nabout buds and stems round his looking-glass, a diagram to catch his\r\neye, if soap should chance to spare it, above his washing basin.\r\nHe missed several meetings of the debating society, but he found\r\nthe chance encounters with Miss Haysman in the spacious ways of the\r\nadjacent art museum, or in the little museum at the top of the College,\r\nor in the College corridors, more frequent and very restful. In\r\nparticular, they used to meet in a little gallery full of wrought-iron\r\nchests and gates, near the art library, and there Hill used to talk,\r\nunder the gentle stimulus of her flattering attention, of Browning and\r\nhis personal ambitions. A characteristic she found remarkable in him\r\nwas his freedom from avarice. He contemplated quite calmly the prospect\r\nof living all his life on an income below a hundred pounds a year. But\r\nhe was determined to be famous, to make, recognisably in his own proper\r\nperson, the world a better place to live in. He took Bradlaugh and John\r\nBurns for his leaders and models, poor, even impecunious, great men.\r\nBut Miss Haysman thought that such lives were deficient on the æsthetic\r\nside, by which, though she did not know it, she meant good wall-paper\r\nand upholstery, pretty books, tasteful clothes, concerts, and meals\r\nnicely cooked and respectfully served.\r\n\r\nAt last came the day of the second examination, and the professor of\r\nbotany, a fussy, conscientious man, rearranged all the tables in a long\r\nnarrow laboratory to prevent copying, and put his demonstrator on a\r\nchair on a table (where he felt, he said, like a Hindoo god), to see\r\nall the cheating, and stuck a notice outside the door, \"Door closed,\"\r\nfor no earthly reason that any human being could discover. And all the\r\nmorning from ten till one the quill of Wedderburn shrieked defiance\r\nat Hill's, and the quills of the others chased their leaders in a\r\ntireless pack, and so also it was in the afternoon. Wedderburn was a\r\nlittle quieter than usual, and Hill's face was hot all day, and his\r\novercoat bulged with textbooks and notebooks against the last moment's\r\nrevision. And the next day, in the morning and in the afternoon, was\r\nthe practical examination, when sections had to be cut and slides\r\nidentified. In the morning Hill was depressed because he knew he had\r\ncut a thick section, and in the afternoon came the mysterious slip.\r\n\r\nIt was just the kind of thing that the botanical professor was always\r\ndoing. Like the income tax, it offered a premium to the cheat. It was\r\na preparation under the microscope, a little glass slip, held in its\r\nplace on the stage of the instrument by light steel clips, and the\r\ninscription set forth that the slip was not to be moved. Each student\r\nwas to go in turn to it, sketch it, write in his book of answers what\r\nhe considered it to be, and return to his place. Now, to move such a\r\nslip is a thing one can do by a chance movement of the finger, and in\r\na fraction of a second. The professor's reason for decreeing that the\r\nslip should not be moved depended on the fact that the object he wanted\r\nidentified was characteristic of a certain tree stem. In the position\r\nin which it was placed it was a difficult thing to recognise, but once\r\nthe slip was moved so as to bring other parts of the preparation into\r\nview, its nature was obvious enough.\r\n\r\nHill came to this, flushed from a contest with staining re-agents, sat\r\ndown on the little stool before the microscope, turned the mirror to\r\nget the best light, and then, out of sheer habit, shifted the slip.\r\nAt once he remembered the prohibition, and, with an almost continuous\r\nmotion of his hands, moved it back, and sat paralysed with astonishment\r\nat his action.\r\n\r\nThen, slowly, he turned his head. The professor was out of the room;\r\nthe demonstrator sat aloft on his impromptu rostrum, reading the\r\n_Q. Jour. Mi. Sci._; the rest of the examinees were busy, and with\r\ntheir backs to him. Should he own up to the accident now? He knew\r\nquite clearly what the thing was. It was a lenticel, a characteristic\r\npreparation from the elder-tree. His eyes roved over his intent\r\nfellow-students, and Wedderburn suddenly glanced over his shoulder at\r\nhim with a queer expression in his eyes. The mental excitement that had\r\nkept Hill at an abnormal pitch of vigour these two days gave way to a\r\ncurious nervous tension. His book of answers was beside him. He did not\r\nwrite down what the thing was, but with one eye at the microscope he\r\nbegan making a hasty sketch of it. His mind was full of this grotesque\r\npuzzle in ethics that had suddenly been sprung upon him. Should he\r\nidentify it? or should he leave this question unanswered? In that\r\ncase Wedderburn would probably come out first in the second result.\r\nHow could he tell now whether he might not have identified the thing\r\nwithout shifting it? It was possible that Wedderburn had failed to\r\nrecognise it, of course. Suppose Wedderburn too had shifted the slide?\r\nHe looked up at the clock. There were fifteen minutes in which to\r\nmake up his mind. He gathered up his book of answers and the coloured\r\npencils he used in illustrating his replies, and walked back to his\r\nseat.\r\n\r\nHe read through his manuscript, and then sat thinking and gnawing\r\nhis knuckle. It would look queer now if he owned up. He _must_ beat\r\nWedderburn. He forgot the examples of those starry gentlemen, John\r\nBurns and Bradlaugh. Besides, he reflected, the glimpse of the rest\r\nof the slip he had had was, after all, quite accidental, forced upon\r\nhim by chance, a kind of providential revelation rather than an unfair\r\nadvantage. It was not nearly so dishonest to avail himself of that as\r\nit was of Broome, who believed in the efficacy of prayer, to pray daily\r\nfor a first-class. \"Five minutes more,\" said the demonstrator, folding\r\nup his paper and becoming observant. Hill watched the clock hands until\r\ntwo minutes remained; then he opened the book of answers, and, with hot\r\nears and an affectation of ease, gave his drawing of the lenticel its\r\nname.\r\n\r\nWhen the second pass list appeared, the previous positions of\r\nWedderburn and Hill were reversed, and the spectacled girl in green,\r\nwho knew the demonstrator in private life (where he was practically\r\nhuman), said that in the result of the two examinations taken together\r\nHill had the advantage of a mark--167 to 166 out of a possible 200.\r\nEveryone admired Hill in a way, though the suspicion of \"mugging\"\r\nclung to him. But Hill was to find congratulations and Miss Haysman's\r\nenhanced opinion of him, and even the decided decline in the crest\r\nof Wedderburn, tainted by an unhappy memory. He felt a remarkable\r\naccess of energy at first, and the note of a democracy marching to\r\ntriumph returned to his debating society speeches; he worked at his\r\ncomparative anatomy with tremendous zeal and effect, and he went on\r\nwith his æsthetic education. But through it all, a vivid little picture\r\nwas continually coming before his mind's eye--of a sneakish person\r\nmanipulating a slide.\r\n\r\nNo human being had witnessed the act, and he was cocksure that no\r\nhigher power existed to see it; but for all that it worried him.\r\nMemories are not dead things, but alive; they dwindle in disuse,\r\nbut they harden and develop in all sorts of queer ways if they are\r\nbeing continually fretted. Curiously enough, though at the time he\r\nperceived clearly that the shifting was accidental, as the days wore\r\non, his memory became confused about it, until at last he was not\r\nsure--although he assured himself that he _was_ sure--whether the\r\nmovement had been absolutely involuntary. Then it is possible that\r\nHill's dietary was conducive to morbid conscientiousness; a breakfast\r\nfrequently eaten in a hurry, a midday bun, and, at such hours after\r\nfive as chanced to be convenient, such meat as his means determined,\r\nusually in a chophouse in a back street off the Brompton Road.\r\nOccasionally he treated himself to threepenny or ninepenny classics,\r\nand they usually represented a suppression of potatoes or chops. It is\r\nindisputable that outbreaks of self-abasement and emotional revival\r\nhave a distinct relation to periods of scarcity. But apart from this\r\ninfluence on the feelings, there was in Hill a distinct aversion\r\nto falsity that the blasphemous Landport cobbler had inculcated by\r\nstrap and tongue from his earliest years. Of one fact about professed\r\natheists I am convinced; they may be--they usually are--fools, void\r\nof subtlety, revilers of holy institutions, brutal speakers, and\r\nmischievous knaves, but they lie with difficulty. If it were not so,\r\nif they had the faintest grasp of the idea of compromise, they would\r\nsimply be liberal churchmen. And, moreover, this memory poisoned his\r\nregard for Miss Haysman. For she now so evidently preferred him to\r\nWedderburn that he felt sure he cared for her, and began reciprocating\r\nher attentions by timid marks of personal regard; at one time he even\r\nbought a bunch of violets, carried it about in his pocket, and produced\r\nit, with a stumbling explanation, withered and dead, in the gallery of\r\nold iron. It poisoned, too, the denunciation of capitalist dishonesty\r\nthat had been one of his life's pleasures. And, lastly, it poisoned his\r\ntriumph in Wedderburn. Previously he had been Wedderburn's superior\r\nin his own eyes, and had raged simply at a want of recognition. Now\r\nhe began to fret at the darker suspicion of positive inferiority. He\r\nfancied he found justifications for his position in Browning, but they\r\nvanished on analysis. At last--moved, curiously enough, by exactly the\r\nsame motive forces that had resulted in his dishonesty--he went to\r\nProfessor Bindon, and made a clean breast of the whole affair. As Hill\r\nwas a paid student, Professor Bindon did not ask him to sit down, and\r\nhe stood before the professor's desk as he made his confession.\r\n\r\n\"It's a curious story,\" said Professor Bindon, slowly realising how\r\nthe thing reflected on himself, and then letting his anger rise,--\"A\r\nmost remarkable story. I can't understand your doing it, and I can't\r\nunderstand this avowal. You're a type of student--Cambridge men would\r\nnever dream--I suppose I ought to have thought--Why _did_ you cheat?\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't--cheat,\" said Hill.\r\n\r\n\"But you have just been telling me you did.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought I explained\"--\r\n\r\n\"Either you cheated or you did not cheat.\"\r\n\r\n\"I said my motion was involuntary.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not a metaphysician, I am a servant of science--of fact. You\r\nwere told not to move the slip. You did move the slip. If that is not\r\ncheating\"--\r\n\r\n\"If I was a cheat,\" said Hill, with the note of hysterics in his voice,\r\n\"should I come here and tell you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your repentance, of course, does you credit,\" said Professor Bindon,\r\n\"but it does not alter the original facts.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir,\" said Hill, giving in in utter self-abasement.\r\n\r\n\"Even now you cause an enormous amount of trouble. The examination list\r\nwill have to be revised.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose so, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose so? Of course it must be revised. And I don't see how I can\r\nconscientiously pass you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not pass me?\" said Hill. \"Fail me?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's the rule in all examinations. Or where should we be? What else\r\ndid you expect? You don't want to shirk the consequences of your own\r\nacts?\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought, perhaps\"--said Hill. And then, \"Fail me? I thought, as I\r\ntold you, you would simply deduct the marks given for that slip.\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible!\" said Bindon. \"Besides, it would still leave you above\r\nWedderburn. Deduct only the marks--Preposterous! The Departmental\r\nRegulations distinctly say\"--\r\n\r\n\"But it's my own admission, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Regulations say nothing whatever of the manner in which the matter\r\ncomes to light. They simply provide\"--\r\n\r\n\"It will ruin me. If I fail this examination, they won't renew my\r\nscholarship.\"\r\n\r\n\"You should have thought of that before.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, sir, consider all my circumstances\"--\r\n\r\n\"I cannot consider anything. Professors in this College are machines.\r\nThe Regulations will not even let us recommend our students for\r\nappointments. I am a machine, and you have worked me. I have to do\"--\r\n\r\n\"It's very hard, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Possibly it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I am to be failed this examination, I might as well go home at\r\nonce.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is as you think proper.\" Bindon's voice softened a little; he\r\nperceived he had been unjust, and, provided he did not contradict\r\nhimself, he was disposed to amelioration, \"As a private person,\" he\r\nsaid, \"I think this confession of yours goes far to mitigate your\r\noffence. But you have set the machinery in motion, and now it must take\r\nits course. I--I am really sorry you gave way.\"\r\n\r\nA wave of emotion prevented Hill from answering. Suddenly, very\r\nvividly, he saw the heavily-lined face of the old Landport cobbler, his\r\nfather. \"Good God! What a fool I have been!\" he said hotly and abruptly.\r\n\r\n\"I hope,\" said Bindon, \"that it will be a lesson to you.\"\r\n\r\nBut, curiously enough, they were not thinking of quite the same\r\nindiscretion.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause.\r\n\r\n\"I would like a day to think, sir, and then I will let you know--about\r\ngoing home, I mean,\" said Hill, moving towards the door.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next day Hill's place was vacant. The spectacled girl in green was,\r\nas usual, first with the news. Wedderburn and Miss Haysman were talking\r\nof a performance of _The Meistersingers_ when she came up to them.\r\n\r\n\"Have you heard?\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Heard what?\"\r\n\r\n\"There was cheating in the examination.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cheating!\" said Wedderburn, with his face suddenly hot. \"How?\"\r\n\r\n\"That slide\"--\r\n\r\n\"Moved? Never!\"\r\n\r\n\"It was. That slide that we weren't to move\"--\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" said Wedderburn. \"Why! How could they find out? Who do they\r\nsay--?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was Mr. Hill.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Hill!_\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Hill!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not--surely not the immaculate Hill?\" said Wedderburn, recovering.\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe it,\" said Miss Haysman. \"How do you know?\"\r\n\r\n\"I _didn't_,\" said the girl in spectacles. \"But I know it now for a\r\nfact. Mr. Hill went and confessed to Professor Bindon himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"By Jove!\" said Wedderburn. \"Hill of all people. But I am always\r\ninclined to distrust these philanthropists-on-principle\"--\r\n\r\n\"Are you quite sure?\" said Miss Haysman, with a catch in her breath.\r\n\r\n\"Quite. It's dreadful, isn't it? But, you know, what can you expect?\r\nHis father is a cobbler.\"\r\n\r\nThen Miss Haysman astonished the girl in spectacles.\r\n\r\n\"I don't care. I will not believe it,\" she said, flushing darkly under\r\nher warm-tinted skin. \"I will not believe it until he has told me so\r\nhimself--face to face. I would scarcely believe it then,\" and abruptly\r\nshe turned her back on the girl in spectacles, and walked to her own\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\"It's true, all the same,\" said the girl in spectacles, peering and\r\nsmiling at Wedderburn.\r\n\r\nBut Wedderburn did not answer her. She was indeed one of those people\r\nwho seem destined to make unanswered remarks.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  PRINTED BY\r\n  MORRISON AND GIBB LIMITED, EDINBURGH\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's note\r\n\r\n\r\nWords in italics were surrounded with _underscores_ and small capitals\r\nchanged to all capitals.\r\n\r\nThe original has been preserved, except for the following corrections,\r\non page\r\n\r\n   11 \"contion\" changed to \"condition\" (in an extremely dishevelled\r\n      condition.)\r\n   99 , changed to .
