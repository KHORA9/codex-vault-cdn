On completing the work by the issue of the last Part it has been\r\ndetermined by the Authors to explain its origin and object a little\r\nmore fully, and this portion of the task has been intrusted to me.\r\n\r\nIt should be quite understood, in the first place, that, as has been\r\nstated in the Introduction, the original conception of the work is due\r\nto the genius and energy of the late Sir Victor Brooke, under whose\r\nsupervision the greater number of the plates and other illustrations\r\nwere prepared, and I need hardly say that it is greatly regretted\r\nby the authors that Sir Victor did not live to carry out his plan.\r\nSir Victor was elected a Fellow of the Zoological Society of London\r\nin 1864, at which time I knew him only as an ardent sportsman, much\r\nattached to Natural History. Some time in the year 1870, I think it\r\nwas, he called upon me at my office, and stated that he had been\r\nattending Sir William (then Professor) Flower’s lectures at the\r\nCollege of Surgeons, and had quite determined to commence serious work\r\nin Natural History, being deeply interested in that subject. After\r\ntalking over the matter with him for some time it was suggested that\r\nthe Ruminant Mammals, with many of which Sir Victor as a sportsman was\r\nwell acquainted, offered an excellent subject for work, and I promised\r\nthat I would take every opportunity that fell in my way of putting at\r\nhis disposal specimens of this class. I was, of course, delighted at\r\ngetting a recruit for Natural History of such energy and ability. I may\r\nmention here that amongst other questions which I asked him at this\r\ninterview was whether he knew German, as without a knowledge of that\r\nlanguage it would be impossible for anyone in these days to do good\r\nwork in Natural Science. Sir Victor in reply regretted his ignorance\r\nof this language, but stated that he should set to work and learn it\r\nat once. A few months afterwards I found to my surprise that he had\r\nkept his word, and was already able to translate passages in the German\r\nauthorities to which he had occasion to refer. I may add that I have\r\ngiven the same advice more than once to other would-be students of\r\nNatural History, but that I never recollect it having been followed\r\nwith such immediate and successful results.\r\n\r\nFrom my position at the Zoological Society and from the aid received\r\nfrom numerous correspondents in all parts of the world, I had little\r\ndifficulty from the first in providing my much-esteemed friend with\r\nmaterials for his studies, and in the beginning of 1871 had the\r\npleasure of putting at his disposal some notes and materials concerning\r\nthe Antelopes of the genus _Tragelaphus_. Upon these was based the\r\nexcellent paper on that genus read by Sir Victor before the Zoological\r\nSociety on the 16th of May of that year, the first of a series of\r\nessays on this and kindred subjects. Four similar papers, as will be\r\nseen by reference to the Zoological Society’s ‘Proceedings,’ followed\r\nin 1872, three in 1874, and others in succeeding years, until 1878,\r\nwhen, I regret to say, they came to an abrupt conclusion. The last of\r\nthe series was one of an extremely useful and important character,\r\ncontaining, as it did, a complete essay on the classification of the\r\nDeer-family and a synopsis of the existing species, which, until\r\nrecently, has remained our leading authority upon this difficult\r\ngroup of Mammals. During the whole of this time also Sir Victor had\r\nbeen engaged in collecting specimens, and in having drawings made\r\nby Wolf and put upon the stone by Smit, for a complete work on the\r\nBovine animals which he had planned out and proposed to write. After\r\n1878, however, other matters intervened and sadly interfered with my\r\nfriend’s studies in Natural History. Sir Victor changed his habitual\r\nresidence to Pau, and though I now saw him occasionally in London on\r\nhis way from France to his home in Ireland, I could never induce him\r\nto continue his former researches, although he always assured me that\r\nhe was still devoted to Natural Science and was determined to return\r\nto it eventually. Circumstances, however, prevented him from carrying\r\nhis wishes into effect. In November 1891, when still in the prime of\r\nlife, Sir Victor died, leaving his great work still unfinished, and\r\nrepresented mainly by a series of over a hundred lithographic plates,\r\nwhich, as already mentioned in the Introduction, have formed the basis\r\nof the present work. The MSS. which were also kindly placed at my\r\ndisposal by the family, not having been touched for nearly fifteen\r\nyears, were in such an incomplete state that it was impossible to\r\nutilize them. Upon pointing out this to his son, the present Sir\r\nDouglas Brooke, he was good enough to assure me that his only wish was\r\nthat the best possible use for Science should be made of the whole of\r\nthe materials accumulated by his father. Acting upon this understanding\r\nI undertook to prepare the letterpress of an entirely new work on the\r\nAntelopes, using such of Sir Victor’s plates as I could employ for its\r\nillustration.\r\n\r\nSuch was the origin of the present work, now happily brought to a\r\nclose after a period of six years, during which it has occupied no\r\nunimportant part of my leisure time. Even so it would not have been\r\npossible for me to have accomplished it without the able assistance\r\nof my excellent friend Mr. Oldfield Thomas, of the British Museum. It\r\nwas, of course, of the greatest advantage to the work that Thomas was\r\nalready familiarly acquainted with the subject, and had, moreover,\r\nunder his charge the unrivalled series of specimens of Mammals\r\ncontained in our National Collection.\r\n\r\nAlthough Thomas and I consider ourselves, of course, jointly\r\nresponsible for all the statements in this work, every line of which\r\nhas undergone the supervision of both authors, I may state that\r\nThomas’s chief part of the task was, as agreed between us, to be the\r\nsynonymy and scientific descriptions, and my speciality the preparation\r\nof the ordinary letterpress. I must also not omit to mention that as\r\nregards the much-vexed subject of Zoological Nomenclature my friend\r\nand I are not in perfect accord, as he takes a more severe view of the\r\nrule of priority than I am disposed to adopt. There has, therefore,\r\nbeen necessarily a little “give and take” on each side as to the names\r\nto be adopted in this work. For these latter, in so far as they may\r\nbe held to contravene the strict laws of nomenclature, Thomas desires\r\nto disclaim--as I am willing to accept--all responsibility. It should\r\nalso be mentioned that during the issue of the last volume Thomas’s\r\nsomewhat serious illness and consequent absence from his post in London\r\nhas compelled him to relegate some of his share in the present work to\r\nMr. R. I. Pocock, of the British Museum, who, I need hardly say, has\r\nmost efficiently assisted me in finishing the task and to whom I hereby\r\ntender my most sincere thanks.\r\n\r\nI must also not forget to record the names of other friends and\r\ncorrespondents who have materially assisted us in the preparation of\r\nthe ‘Book of Antelopes.’ Amongst these I must specially mention Herr\r\nMatschie, of the Natural History Museum of Berlin, who has kindly\r\nfurnished many notes on the collection of Mammals under his charge in\r\nthat Institution; nor must I forget the names of Mr. F. C. Selous,\r\nHerr Oscar Neumann, Mr. S. L. Hinde, Mr. F. V. Kirby, Capt. H. G. C.\r\nSwayne, Mr. Ernest Gedge, Sir Harry Johnston, K.C.B., Mr. R. Crawshay,\r\nMr. Alfred Sharpe, Sir John Kirk, Mr. F. E. Blaauw, Mr. F. J. Jackson,\r\nMajor F. C. Trollope, Dr. E. Büchner, Mr. E. Buxton, Mr. J. I. S.\r\nWhitaker, Sir Edmund Loder, Mr. A. E. Pease, Mr. Lort Phillips, Mr. T.\r\nW. H. Clarke, Mr. J. ffolliott Darling, Mr. John Millais, Mr. W. E. de\r\nWinton, and my son Mr. W. L. Sclater, Director of the South African\r\nMuseum, Capetown, to all of whom, on behalf of Thomas and myself, I\r\nwish to tender our most heartfelt thanks for their kind assistance.\r\n\r\nFinally, I may mention that this work has been issued in parts at the\r\nfollowing dates:--\r\n\r\n    Part I.

Their main object is to furnish\r\ndescriptive letterpress for the beautiful series of lithographic plates\r\ndrawn some twenty years ago under the supervision of the late Sir\r\nVICTOR BROOKE, making thereto such necessary modifications\r\nand additions as the progress of science demands. This letterpress,\r\nhowever, will contain a full synonymy of all the species of Antelopes\r\nrecognized as valid, whether here figured or not, together with\r\nsuch descriptions as will facilitate their identification, and all\r\nparticulars concerning their habits and distribution that have been\r\nrecorded by Naturalists and Sportsmen up to the present time.\r\n\r\nAs regards the Nomenclature and Systematic Arrangement to be employed\r\nin the present work, we think it sufficient to follow those adopted by\r\nSir William Flower and Mr. Lydekker in their standard work on Mammals,\r\nwith a few slight modifications. These authors have divided the Family\r\n_Bovidæ_, to which the Antelopes pertain, into nine different\r\ngroups, called sections, which are denominated as follows:--\r\n\r\n    1. Alcelaphine Section.\r\n\r\n    2. Cephalophine Section.\r\n\r\n    3. Cervicaprine Section.\r\n\r\n    4. Antilopine Section.\r\n\r\n    5. Hippotragine Section.\r\n\r\n    6. Tragelaphine Section.\r\n\r\n    7. Rupicaprine Section.\r\n\r\n    8. Caprine Section.\r\n\r\n    9. Bovine Section.\r\n\r\nThe Antelopes, commonly so called, belong to the first six of these\r\nsections, and will form the subject of the present work, the last three\r\nsections, which contain the Mountain-Antelopes, Sheep, and Oxen, being\r\nexcluded.\r\n\r\nIt is further considered to be more convenient to regard the sections\r\nof Messrs. Flower and Lydekker as subfamilies, and to give them the\r\nusual termination employed for such groups. Thus, after dividing the\r\n“Cephalophine Section” into two portions, which it seems desirable to\r\ndo, we shall have altogether seven subfamilies of _Bovidæ_ to be\r\ntreated of, viz.:--\r\n\r\n   I. BUBALIDINÆ, comprising the Hartebeests and Gnus.\r\n\r\n   II. CEPHALOPHINÆ, comprising the Duykers and Four-horned\r\n   Antelopes.\r\n\r\n   III. NEOTRAGINÆ, comprising the Dwarf Antelopes, Oribis,\r\n   Klipspringers, and Dik-diks.\r\n\r\n   IV. CERVICAPRINÆ, comprising the Waterbucks, Reedbucks, and\r\n   their allies.\r\n\r\n   V. ANTILOPINÆ, comprising the typical Antelopes and Gazelles.\r\n\r\n   VI. HIPPOTRAGINÆ, comprising the Sable and Roan Antelopes and\r\n   the various species of Gemsbuck.\r\n\r\n   VII. TRAGELAPHINÆ, comprising the Nylghai, Bushbucks, Kudus, and\r\n   Elands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SUBFAMILY I. _BUBALIDINÆ._\r\n\r\n\r\n_General Characters._--Size large. Muzzle naked. A small\r\nanteorbital gland[2] present. Nostrils large, valvular, the lower lids\r\ncovered with short bristly hairs. Tail long and tufted. False hoofs\r\nlarge. No knee-brushes. Mammæ 2 or 4.\r\n\r\nSkull without supraorbital pits or lachrymal vacuities, but with\r\nshallow lachrymal pits. Upper molar teeth tall and very narrow.\r\n\r\nHorns present in both sexes, those of the female merely rather more\r\nslender than those of the male; always of medium length, that is,\r\napproximately, of the length of the head.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Range of Subfamily._ Whole of Africa, including the Arabian Subregion.\r\n\r\nThe Subfamily _Bubalidinæ_ is readily divisible into three genera,\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n   1. BUBALIS, the true Hartebeests, with abnormally long faces and\r\n   doubly-curved horns;\r\n\r\n   2. DAMALISCUS, the Bonteboks and their allies, with normal faces\r\n   and simply-curved horns; and\r\n\r\n   3. CONNOCHÆTES, the Gnus: remarkable animals with tufted faces,\r\n   maned necks, expanded muzzles, and doubly-curved horns.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           GENUS I. BUBALIS.\r\n\r\n                                                          Type.\r\n    _Bubalis_, =Licht.= Mag. nat. Freund. Berl.\r\n       vi. p. 154 (1814)                              B.

Small\r\ninterorbital perforations present; lachrymal pits present but shallow.\r\nMolars very tall and narrow, and without supplementary lobes in the\r\nupper jaw.\r\n\r\nHorns present in both sexes, those of the female as long, but not so\r\nthick, as those of the male, placed close together at their bases;\r\ndoubly curved, first rising outwards or backwards, then curved forwards\r\nand upwards, and then bent abruptly backwards and upwards at their tips.\r\n\r\n_Range of the Genus._ Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.\r\n\r\nThis genus, containing the Hartebeests, is a very natural and\r\nwell-defined one, and is curiously shown to be so by the fact that, so\r\nfar as is as yet known, the ranges of the different species nowhere\r\noverlap each other, whilst almost every part of the range of the genus\r\npossesses its single representative species.\r\n\r\nThe members of the genus fall into four rather definite groups, as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n    A. Frontal horn-pedicle short; horns forming a V when viewed in\r\n         front        1, 2. _B. buselaphus_, _B. major_.\r\n\r\n    B. Horn-pedicle moderate; horns forming an inverted bracket.\r\n                 3, 4, 5. _B. tora_, _B. swaynei_, _B. cokei_.\r\n\r\n    C. Horn-pedicle extremely elongated; horns forming a V when viewed\r\n         in front     6, 7. _B. caama_, _B. jacksoni_.\r\n\r\n    D. Horn-pedicle very short and broad; horns much curved inwards\r\n         towards each other before the final backward turn.\r\n                 8. _B. lichtensteini_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    _Smit lith._          _Hanhart imp._\r\n\r\n  The Bubal.\r\n\r\n  BUBALIS BUSELAPHUS.\r\n\r\n  _Published by R.

Facial hairs reversed upwards\r\nfor about two inches on the nose, then slanting downwards from a point\r\non the forehead just below the horns, where there is a twisted whorl\r\nfrom which the hairs radiate in all directions. Colour uniform pale\r\nrufous or fawn, entirely without darker patches on forehead, chin, or\r\nlimbs; there is, however, an ill-defined patch of greyish on each side\r\nof the muzzle above the nostrils; lower part of rump not whitish. Tail\r\nblack on the terminal tuft only, the rest like the back.\r\n\r\nSkull long, but the elongation less than in _B. caama_. _Approximate_\r\ndimensions:--basal length 13 inches, greatest breadth 4·8, muzzle\r\nto orbit 10[3]. Facial length from between the horns to the tip of\r\nthe nasals 13·5 inches; breadth of the forehead, across the frontal\r\nhorn-support, 4·0. Horns diverging from each other at an even rounded\r\ncurve, so as together to form a U when viewed from the front, a method\r\nof curvature only found in this and the next species. In length, when\r\nmeasured round the curves, they attain to a little more than 14 inches.\r\n\r\n   _Hab._ Northern Africa (interior of Morocco, Algeria, and Tunis)\r\n   and Arabia.\r\n\r\nThe Bubal (_Bubalis_ or _Bubalus_) is one of the few Antelopes known\r\nto the ancient writers, being included by Herodotus among the beasts\r\nof Libya, and being likewise mentioned by Aristotle, Æschylus, and\r\nPliny. The Bubal is also referred to in the Old Testament and called\r\n“Yachmur”--a term which has been incorrectly translated in the\r\nauthorized version as “Fallow Deer.” Under this name it is included in\r\nthe list of the daily provisions of King Solomon (i. Kings, iv. 23) as\r\none of the animals brought to the royal table.\r\n\r\nComing to more modern days we find that in the time of Dr. Thomas Shaw,\r\nF.R.S., of Queen’s College, Oxford (who was resident twelve years at\r\nAlgiers as British Chaplain), the Bubal was abundant on the north of\r\nthe Atlas. Dr. Shaw (‘Travels in Barbary and the Levant,’ Oxford,\r\n1738), in his “Physical and Miscellaneous Observations on the Natural\r\nHistory of Algiers and Tunis,” tells us:--\r\n\r\n“Of cattle that are not naturally tame and domesticated, these Kingdoms\r\nafford large Herds of the Neat kind called _Bekker el Wash_ by the\r\n_Arabs_. This _Species_ is remarkable for having a rounder Turn of\r\nBody, a flatter Face, with Horns bending more towards each other\r\nthan in the tame kind. It is therefore, in all Probability, the _Bos\r\nafricanus_ of _Bellonius_, which he seems justly to take for the\r\n_Bubalus_ of the Ancients; though, what he describeth is little bigger\r\nthan the _Caprea_ or Roe-Buck, whereas ours is nearly of the same size\r\nwith the Red-Deer, with which also it agreeth in Colour. The young\r\nCalves of this _Species_ quickly grow tame, and herd with other Cattle.”\r\n\r\nSince the days of Shaw, however, the Bubal has retired far beyond the\r\nAtlas into the recesses of the desert, and has become a difficult\r\nanimal to meet with. Loche (Expl. Sc. de l’Algérie) tells us that it\r\nis now confined to the mountainous districts of the Sahara, where it\r\nroams about in small troops. Canon Tristram states that “the hunters\r\nof Souf frequently obtain this, the largest of game in North Africa.”\r\nBut he does not think that it “ever ventures north of the Wed R’hir\r\nand M’zab districts, while its home is certainly further south. It is\r\nconsidered to be the most savoury meat of the desert-epicure.” During\r\nhis extensive explorations in the Great Sahara Canon Tristram saw this\r\nAntelope only on one occasion: this was at a distance, in the south of\r\nthe Djereed of Tunis.\r\n\r\nFrom the Algerian Sahara the Bubal extends no doubt into Morocco on\r\none side and Tripoli on the other; but our knowledge of the animals of\r\nboth these countries is still very meagre, and we are unable to quote\r\nprecise authorities. In Egypt, so far as we know, the Bubal appears to\r\nbe now quite extinct, but on the other side of the Red Sea it reappears\r\nin Arabia and extends even up to the confines of Palestine. Canon\r\nTristram never saw it alive in Palestine; “but it certainly exists on\r\nthe borders of Gilead and Moab,” and is well known to the Arabs, who\r\nassured him that “it sometimes comes down to drink at the head-waters\r\nof the streams flowing into the Dead Sea, where they not unfrequently\r\ncapture it.” Canon Tristram has kindly allowed one of us to examine\r\na pair of horns obtained from the Arabs in this locality, which are\r\napparently referable to a female of this species.\r\n\r\nThe Bubal has been long introduced to the zoological gardens of Europe,\r\nand its name occurs in the MS. Catalogues of the Zoological Society\r\nas early as 1832. It bred in the Derby Menagerie, and the young one\r\nwas figured in the drawings illustrative of that splendid collection\r\n(pl. xx.). It is not, however, very common in captivity, and of late\r\nyears but few specimens have been received. At the present time there\r\nis only a single example of this Antelope in the Zoological Society’s\r\ncollection. It is a female, presented by Mr. Robert Pitcairn, of Oran,\r\nin October 1883, and obtained, no doubt, in the interior of Western\r\nAlgeria. Mr. Smit’s illustration (Plate I.) was prepared from this\r\nspecimen.\r\n\r\nThe series of specimens of this Antelope in the British Museum is not\r\nby any means a full one. There are an adult male (stuffed) and an adult\r\nfemale (in skin) from the Zoological Society’s old collection, and a\r\nyoung one obtained by Fraser in the Djereed of Tunis in 1846, besides\r\nsome pairs of horns and frontlets. Fresh examples of this species from\r\ndefinite localities would therefore be highly valued by the Trustees.\r\n\r\n    _May, 1894._\r\n\r\n\r\n                      2.

Terminal tuft of\r\ntail black.\r\n\r\n“Frontal bone between the base of the horns and orbit convex, the same\r\npart being remarkably flat in other species.” (_Brooke_, MS.)\r\n\r\nFacial length 17½ inches, muzzle to orbit 13, breadth of forehead 4·4.\r\n\r\nHorns curved as in the Bubal, but longer and heavier, their length\r\nround the curves amounting to over 20 inches.\r\n\r\n   _Hab._ Gambia, Lower Niger district, and interior of Cameroons.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt of the existence of a Bubal allied to _B.\r\nbuselaphus_ in several districts on the West Coast of Africa. But\r\nthere are no perfect specimens of this Antelope at present available\r\nfor comparison, and its distinctness from its northern representative\r\nmay still be a matter of some uncertainty, although we have good\r\nreason to believe that the two species will ultimately prove to be\r\nspecifically different.\r\n\r\nThe well-known naturalist Edward Blyth, for many years Curator of the\r\nIndian Museum, Calcutta, and a good authority on the larger Mammals,\r\nwas the first writer to call attention to the existence of this\r\nAntelope. In a communication made to the Zoological Society in 1869,\r\nBlyth states that he had examined a “perfect skin” of what he at once\r\nrecognized as a “distinct though closely allied species,” differing\r\nfrom _B. buselaphus_ “in being fully as large as a Hartebeest, and\r\nin having black markings in front of all four feet above the hoofs.”\r\nBlyth’s opinion was that some mounted specimens which he saw in the\r\nMuseums of Leyden and Amsterdam referred to _B. buselaphus_\r\nbelonged strictly to this new form. He also exhibited on the same\r\noccasion a pair of frontlets belonging to Ward, of Vere Street, as\r\nreferable to what he proposed to designate _Boselaphus major_.\r\nThese frontlets, which were subsequently figured in the Society’s\r\n‘Proceedings,’ are now in the British Museum.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 1 _a_.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 1 _b_.\r\n\r\n  Horns of _Bubalis major_.\r\n\r\n  (Gambia, _Carter_, 1891.)]\r\n\r\nWhether the “variety 1” of the Bubal, established by Gray in 1850 upon\r\na skin without horns or hoofs, said to have been brought by Fraser\r\nfrom Tunis, really belonged to this species, must ever remain doubtful.\r\nThis skin is no longer to be found, and if it were really referable to\r\n_B. major_ it was probably brought by Fraser from West Africa and\r\nnot from Tunis, where the typical _B. buselaphus_ is found. Gray’s\r\ninaccuracy as regards localities is notorious, and Fraser visited both\r\nparts of Africa. Under these circumstances we may altogether neglect\r\nthe name “_tunisianus_” bestowed on this “variety” in 1852, as\r\nbeing highly doubtful as well as inapplicable.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 1 _c_.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 1 _d_.\r\n\r\n  Horns and skull of _Bubalis major_.\r\n\r\n  _c._ Front view; _d._ Side view. (Brooke.)]\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the horns from the Cameroons, referred by Herr\r\nMatschie to “_B. lelwel_, Heuglin,” and those from Togoland,\r\nreferred by the same author to _B. major_, also belong to this\r\nspecies, which would appear to inhabit suitable districts in Western\r\nAfrica from Senegal to the Cameroons.\r\n\r\nA pair of horns of this Antelope was amongst the specimens obtained by\r\nDr. Percy Kendall from the Gambia in 1890. Another very fine pair was\r\nbrought by Sir Gilbert Carter from the Gambia in 1891, from which the\r\naccompanying drawings (figs. 1 _a_ and 1 _b_, p. 12) have\r\nbeen taken. These horns are in Sclater’s possession.\r\n\r\nThe two other figures (figs. 1 _c_ and 1 _d_, p. 13) were\r\nprepared by Sir Victor Brooke, probably from horns in his collection.\r\n\r\nBesides Blyth’s frontlets already mentioned, there are a pair of horns\r\nof the Bubal in the British Museum obtained by Mr. E. Bower on the\r\nLower Niger in 1892, and several other specimens of horns without exact\r\nlocalities. Sclater has also examined, casually, a mounted specimen\r\nin the Senckenbergian Museum at Frankfort-a/M., labelled _Bubalis\r\nmauritanica_, which is probably of this species. According to his\r\nnotes it is “nearly uniform brown; forehead ferruginous; black round\r\nthe feet.”\r\n\r\n    _May, 1894._\r\n\r\n\r\n                             3.

Colour uniform pale fulvous, decidedly\r\npaler than in other species, and, with the exception of the usual black\r\nchin and tail-tuft, entirely without black markings. Lower part of rump\r\nbehind decidedly lighter than the dorsal surface.\r\n\r\nSkull slenderer and more lightly built than usual; frontal narrow; its\r\nelongation medium.\r\n\r\nBasal length 15·7 inches, greatest breadth 5·3, muzzle to orbit 12·5,\r\nfacial length 16·5, breadth of forehead 3·4.\r\n\r\nHorns shaped somewhat like an inverted bracket, a comparison that is,\r\nhowever, better borne out by the two following species, as in the Tora\r\nthe diverging parts of the two horns start up at a slight angle with\r\neach other, instead of being in the same straight line. The horns\r\nthemselves are unusually slender, and attain a length of about 19\r\ninches.\r\n\r\n   _Hab._ Upper Nubia, Northern Abyssinia, and Kordofan.\r\n\r\nThe Tora or Tétel was confounded by von Heuglin and Sir Samuel Baker,\r\nits first discoverers, with the Bubal. But these two Antelopes, though\r\nalike of uniform colour, are easily distinguishable on comparison by\r\nthe larger size and higher gait of the Tora and by the different shape\r\nof its horns. The Tora would also seem to inhabit more wooded and\r\nbroken country than the open deserts that are the home of the allied\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nHeuglin tells us that this Antelope is found in families and herds\r\nin the valleys at the foot of Mount Takah, in the district of the\r\nBeni-Ammer Arabs, in Upper Barca, on the Anseba and Atbara and their\r\nconfluents, and in the lower districts of Northern Abyssinia. He found\r\nit likewise plentiful on the sources of the Dender and Rahad, and in\r\nGalabat. It inhabits the sheltered country where there is high grass\r\nand underwood, is not particularly timid, and sometimes even stupidly\r\nbold, resorting regularly in the morning and evening to the usual\r\npastures and drinking-places.\r\n\r\nIn his volume on ‘The Nile Tributaries of Abyssinia’ Sir Samuel Baker\r\nfrequently mentions the “Tétel,” as he calls this Antelope.\r\n\r\nIn August 1861, being on the banks of the Atbara, he writes:--\r\n\r\n“The country being now bright green, the Antelopes are distinctly\r\nvisible on the opposite side. Three Tétel graze regularly together in\r\nthe same place daily. This Antelope is a variety of the Hartebeest of\r\nSouth Africa; it is of a reddish-chestnut colour, and is of about the\r\nsize of an Alderney cow.”\r\n\r\nA month later Sir Samuel tells us:--\r\n\r\n“When about halfway to the river, as we were passing through grass\r\nabout 4 feet high, three Tétel bounded from a ravine, and passing\r\ndirectly before us, gave me a splendid shot at about sixty yards. The\r\nCeylon No. 10 struck the foremost through the shoulder, and it fell\r\ndead after running a few yards. This was also my first Tétel; it was in\r\nsplendid condition, the red coat was like satin, and the animal would\r\nweigh about five hundred pounds live weight.”\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards the skin of the Tétel was taken off entire, the\r\napertures at the neck and knees tied up, and the hide inflated and\r\ningeniously converted into a waterproof bag, to be used for the\r\nconveyance of the flesh of the animal across the river Atbara.\r\n\r\nIn a subsequent part of his journey in the valley of the Settite, a\r\nconfluent of the Atbara, Baker again records his adventures with this\r\nAntelope as follows:--\r\n\r\n“We had hardly ridden half a mile when I perceived a fine bull Tétel\r\nstanding near a bush a few hundred yards distant. Motioning to the\r\nparty to halt I dismounted, and with the little Fletcher rifle I\r\nendeavoured to obtain a shot. When within about a hundred and seventy\r\nyards he observed our party, and I was obliged to take the shot,\r\nalthough I could have approached unseen to a closer distance had his\r\nattention not been attracted by the noise of the horses. He threw his\r\nhead up preparatory to starting off, and he was just upon the move as\r\nI touched the trigger. He fell like a stone to the shot, but almost\r\nimmediately he regained his feet and bounded off, receiving a bullet\r\nfrom the second barrel without a flinch; in full speed he rushed away\r\nacross the party of aggageers about three hundred yards distant. Out\r\ndashed Abou Do from the ranks on his active grey horse, and away he\r\nflew after the wounded Tétel, his long hair floating in the wind, his\r\nnaked sword in hand, and his heels digging into the flanks of his\r\nhorse, as though armed with spurs in the last finish of a race. It\r\nwas a beautiful course; Abou Do hunted like a cunning greyhound; the\r\nTétel turned, and taking advantage of the double, he cut off the angle;\r\nsucceeding by the manœuvre, he again followed at tremendous speed over\r\nthe numerous inequalities of the ground, gaining in the race until he\r\nwas within twenty yards of the Tétel, when we lost sight of both game\r\nand hunter in the thick bushes. By this time I had regained my horse,\r\nthat was brought to meet me, and I followed to the spot, towards which\r\nmy wife and the aggageers encumbered with the unwilling apes were\r\nalready hastening. Upon arrival I found, in high yellow grass beneath\r\na large tree, the Tétel dead, and Abou Do wiping his bloody sword,\r\nsurrounded by the foremost of the party. He had hamstrung the animal so\r\ndelicately that the keen edge of the blade was not injured against the\r\nbone. My two bullets had passed through the Tétel: the first was too\r\nhigh, having entered above the shoulder--this had dropped the animal\r\nfor a moment; the second was through the flank.”\r\n\r\nAs we have already stated, both Heuglin and Baker confounded the Tora\r\nwith the Bubal. In 1873 the British Museum first received specimens of\r\nthis Antelope from the Bogos district west of Massowa. The keen eye of\r\nthe then keeper of the Zoological Department quickly recognized the\r\nessential differences of the new species from the previously known\r\nmembers of the genus, and it was briefly described, first in ‘Nature’\r\nand afterwards in the ‘Annals of Natural History.’\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 2.\r\n\r\n  Head of _Bubalis tora_.\r\n\r\n  (P. Z. S. 1873, p. 762.)]\r\n\r\nIn December of the same year Sclater exhibited a mounted head of this\r\nAntelope at one of the meetings of the Zoological Society, from whose\r\n‘Proceedings’ the accompanying figure of the specimen in question (fig.\r\n2) has been borrowed by leave of the Publication Committee.\r\n\r\nTwo years later, in July 1875, a female example of this Antelope was\r\nobtained alive for the Zoological Society’s Menagerie; and in the\r\nfollowing year, in October, a fine pair of the Tora was purchased by\r\nthe Society for the sum of £100, of Mr. Carl Hagenbeck, the well-known\r\ndealer of Hamburg. These animals had been obtained along with others\r\nfrom the Arabs of Upper Nubia and brought out _viâ_ Kassala and\r\nSuakim by Mr. Hagenbeck’s agents. Other specimens of the Tora from the\r\nsame source reached several zoological gardens on the Continent about\r\nthe same date; but we believe that they have one and all disappeared,\r\nand, so far as we know, the Tora is no longer to be seen anywhere in\r\ncaptivity.\r\n\r\nThere is a good pair of this Antelope in the Gallery of the British\r\nMuseum mounted from skins stated to have been procured at Dembelas, in\r\nNorthern Abyssinia. There are also a skeleton and other specimens from\r\nthe same locality in the National Collection.\r\n\r\n    _May, 1894._\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE BOOK OF ANTELOPES. PL.

In\r\nlength good male horns attain to about 18 inches.\r\n\r\n   _Hab._ Interior of Northern Somaliland and Shoa.\r\n\r\nAlthough this fine Hartebeest was pursued and slain by several\r\nenergetic hunters before Captain Swayne met with it in Somaliland, it\r\nis to the last-named distinguished explorer that we are indebted for\r\nour first perfect specimens and for an account of its range and habits,\r\nand it is therefore appropriately named after him.\r\n\r\nThe first evidence received of the occurrence of a Hartebeest in\r\nSomaliland was a flat native skin contained in a collection brought\r\nhome by Herr Menges along with a lot of living animals imported for\r\nMr. Hagenbeck, of Hamburg. In some notes on these skins (P. Z. S.\r\n1884, p. 539) Sclater referred the specimen in question to _B.\r\ncaama_. Again, Mr. E. Lort Phillips, F.Z.S., who was one of Mr.\r\nJames’s party in Somaliland in the winter of 1885, shot a single young\r\nmale Hartebeest near the northern boundary of the high plateau south\r\nof Berbera in April of that year (see P. Z. S. 1885, p. 932), but\r\nunfortunately lost the skull which he had preserved, and did not meet\r\nwith the species again.\r\n\r\nThe next record of this Hartebeest is from a different locality. The\r\nItalian naturalist Dr. Traversi in 1886 transmitted to Florence a\r\nHartebeest’s head which, in his list of Traversi’s collection, Dr.\r\nGiglioli referred to _B. caama_. After examining the specimen\r\nin the Museum of Florence, and receiving a drawing of it from Dr.\r\nGiglioli, Sclater (see P. Z. S. 1892, p. 258) was able to assure\r\nhimself that it was in all probability the same as _B. swaynei_ of\r\nSomaliland.\r\n\r\nIn his “Field-notes” on the Antelopes of Somaliland (P. Z. S. 1892,\r\np. 303) Captain Swayne furnishes us with an excellent account of this\r\nanimal, which we now reproduce:--\r\n\r\n“South of the highest ranges of Somaliland, and at a distance of about\r\n100 miles from the coast, are open plains some four or five thousand\r\nfeet above the sea-level, alternating with broken ground covered with\r\nthorn-jungle, with an undergrowth of aloes growing sometimes to a\r\nheight of six feet.\r\n\r\n“This elevated country, called the ‘Haud,’ is waterless for three\r\nmonths, from January to March; it was crossed by Mr. James’s party in\r\n1884, when their camels were thirteen days without water.\r\n\r\n“Much of the Haud is bush-covered wilderness or open semi-desert, but\r\nsome of the higher plains are, at the proper season, in early summer,\r\ncovered, far as the eye can reach, with a beautiful carpet of green\r\ngrass, like English pasture-land. At this time of the year pools of\r\nwater may be found, as the rainfall is abundant.\r\n\r\n“This kind of open grass country is called the ‘Ban.’ Not a bush is to\r\nbe seen, and some of these plains are thirty or forty miles each way.\r\n\r\n“There is not always much game to be got at in the Haud; but a year\r\nago, coming on to ground which had not yet been visited by Europeans,\r\nI found one of these plains covered with herds of Hartebeests, there\r\nbeing perhaps a dozen herds in sight at one time, each containing three\r\nor four hundred individuals. Hundreds of bulls were scattered singly on\r\nthe outskirts and in spaces between the herds, grazing, fighting, or\r\nlying down.\r\n\r\n“The scene I describe was at a distance of over a hundred miles from\r\nBerbera; and the game has probably been driven far beyond that point by\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n“The Hartebeest bulls are very pugnacious, and two or three couples may\r\nbe fighting round the same herd at one time. Often one of the bulls\r\nwill be sent rolling head over heels.\r\n\r\n“The easiest way to get a specimen is to send a couple of Midgans round\r\nabove the wind to drive the Hartebeest towards you, at the same time\r\nlying down in the grass. A shot may be got within fifty yards, but no\r\none would care to shoot many Hartebeests, as the trophy is poor.\r\n\r\n“Often Oryxes and Sœmmerring’s Gazelles are seen in company with these\r\ngreat troops of Hartebeests, but the Oryxes are much wilder. The\r\nHartebeests are rather tame, and they and the Sœmmerring’s Gazelles are\r\nalways the last to move away.\r\n\r\n“Hartebeests have great curiosity, and rush round a caravan,\r\nhalting now and then within two hundred yards to gaze. This sight\r\nis an extraordinary one, these Antelopes having heavy and powerful\r\nforequarters, head, and chest, of a different shade of chestnut to the\r\nhindquarters, which are poor and fall away. In the midday haze on the\r\nplains they look like troops of Lions.\r\n\r\n“The pace of the Hartebeest is an ungraceful lumbering canter; but\r\nthis species is really the fleetest and most enduring of the Somali\r\nAntelopes. The largest herd I have ever seen must have contained a\r\nthousand individuals, packed closely together, and looking like a\r\nregiment of cavalry, the whole plain round being dotted with single\r\nbulls. Their coats are glossy, like that of a well-groomed horse.\r\n\r\n“From their living so much in open grass plains the Hartebeests must\r\nsubsist entirely on grass, for there is nothing else to eat; and they\r\nmust be able to exist for several days without water.\r\n\r\n“Hartebeests are the favourite food of Lions, and once, when out with\r\nmy brother, I found a troop of three Lions sitting out on the open\r\nplains, ten miles from the nearest bush. They had evidently been out\r\nall night among the herds, and on their becoming gorged, the rising sun\r\nhad found them disinclined to move.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 3.\r\n\r\n  Skull of _Bubalis swaynei_.\r\n\r\n  (P. Z. S. 1892, p. 99.)]\r\n\r\n“Hartebeest horns vary greatly in shape and size. There are short\r\nmassive horns and long pointed ones, and all the gradations between.\r\nSome curve forward, with the points thrown back; others curve outwards\r\nin the same plane as the forehead, the points turning upwards”[4].\r\n\r\nOur coloured figure of this Antelope (Plate II.) has been drawn by\r\nMr. Smit from the mounted specimen in the British Museum, obtained by\r\nCaptain Swayne on the Haud plateau of Somaliland.\r\n\r\nThe woodcut (fig. 3, p. 24) gives a front view of the first skull\r\nand horns received from Captain Swayne, upon which Sclater based the\r\nspecies. This specimen is now likewise in the National Collection.\r\n\r\n    _May, 1894._\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    THE BOOK OF ANTELOPES. PL.

These horns were referred by Peters, in his account of\r\nthe mammals of Von der Decken’s expedition, to _B. caama_ of the\r\nCape. But Sir Victor Brooke, who subsequently examined them at Berlin,\r\nas we know from his MSS., was convinced of their distinctness from\r\nthe species of the Cape Colony, and had determined to call the new\r\nspecies after Von der Decken, although he never published the name. The\r\nsubjoined figures (4 _a_ and 4 _b_) were prepared under Sir\r\nVictor Brooke’s direction, and show a front view and a three-quarter\r\nview of these horns.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 4 _a_.\r\n\r\n  Horns of _Bubalis cokei_, front view.]\r\n\r\nIn June 1880 Col. the Hon. W. C. W. Coke, F.Z.S., a renowned English\r\nsportsman, started from Zanzibar on a shooting-expedition towards\r\nMpapwa, along the caravan-route from the port of Saadani. On reaching\r\nthe open plains on the plateau of Usagara he met with several herds of\r\nthis Antelope, and obtained the frontlet (fig. 4 _c_), now in the\r\nBritish Museum, upon which the species was established by Dr. Günther.\r\n\r\nColonel Coke has kindly permitted us to refer to his journal, in which\r\nwe find it recorded that he first met with this Hartebeest on June\r\n28th, between the Missionary Stations of Mamboia and Mpapwa. On July\r\n10th, when encamped near M’lalli, at the edge of the plains, though\r\nsick with fever, he went out and shot the animal, upon the head of\r\nwhich the species was afterwards based. After this Colonel Coke was\r\ntaken so ill that he had to be carried back to the coast in a hammock,\r\nand was unable to shoot any more of these Antelopes.\r\n\r\nIn Sir John Kirk’s collection are two fine heads of this Hartebeest,\r\nlikewise obtained by him in Usagara.\r\n\r\nProceeding northwards to the country round Kilimanjaro we find that\r\nMr. H. C. V. Hunter, in his appendix to Sir John Willoughby’s ‘East\r\nAfrica and its Big Game,’ records Coke’s Hartebeest as, at the date\r\nof his visit (1887), “quite the most common Antelope in the plains”\r\nof that district, “being found everywhere in immense herds.” From the\r\nsame part of the British East-African Company’s territory we have seen\r\nand examined numerous other heads of this Hartebeest, including fine\r\nexamples of both sexes belonging to Consul-General Holmwood, obtained\r\nduring a shooting-excursion from Zanzibar to this attractive district.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 4 _b_.\r\n\r\n  Horns of _Bubalis cokei_, side view.]\r\n\r\nMr. Ernest Gedge, who traversed British East Africa in company with Mr.\r\nF. J. Jackson, has kindly compiled from his note-books the following\r\naccount of his experiences with Coke’s Hartebeest:--\r\n\r\n“These Antelopes range over a very wide extent of country in both\r\nBritish and German East Africa. In the latter sphere I have procured\r\nspecimens on the south shore of the Victoria Nyanza which in all\r\nrespects were identical with those found nearer the coast; hence it is\r\nreasonable to suppose that they occupy the entire region lying between\r\nthe lake and the coast. In British East Africa the northern limit of\r\ntheir extension seems to be somewhere about Lake Naivasha in the Masai\r\ncountry. On one occasion, however, I obtained an odd specimen in the\r\nvalley of the Ngare Rongri, to the south of Lake Baringo, but, as a\r\nrule, they are not to be found so far north, as in this district they\r\ngive place to _B. jacksoni_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 4 _c_.\r\n\r\n  Horns of _Bubalis cokei_, front view.\r\n\r\n  (Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist. ser. 5, xiv. p. 426.)]\r\n\r\n“Between Lake Naivasha and the coast _B. cokei_ is very commonly\r\nmet with. It frequents every kind of locality, and is equally at home\r\nin the bush-covered wilderness lying behind the coast-line and on\r\nthe vast treeless plains around the base of Kilimanjaro which extend\r\nnorthwards towards Lake Naivasha, and during the hottest seasons of\r\nthe year it is often encountered in the most arid and pastureless\r\nlocalities many miles distant from the nearest water.\r\n\r\n“Being of a sociable disposition, Coke’s Hartebeest is usually seen\r\nin company with other game, and the sight of these vast mixed herds,\r\nwhich include Zebras and Grant’s and Thomson’s Gazelles, is one not\r\neasily forgotten. Like all Hartebeest it is very wary and difficult\r\nto approach, its senses of sight and scent being extremely keen.\r\nDuring the time that the herd is grazing there are usually one or two\r\nsentinels posted on the nearest elevations to give warning of the\r\napproach of danger. The white-ant-hills with which the entire country\r\nabounds are usually selected for this purpose, and are patronized to\r\nsuch an extent, that I have seen as many as eight or ten occupying the\r\nsummit of one of these hills, which looked as if it could only support\r\na third of that number. The reddish colour and general contour of these\r\nmounds bears in many cases so close a resemblance to the Antelopes\r\nthemselves (particularly when grazing) that I have frequently been\r\ndeceived by their appearance.\r\n\r\n“When alarmed they utter a few short whistling snorts and take\r\nto flight. If surprised suddenly in the bush they usually run a\r\nconsiderable distance before halting, but when the danger has been\r\nperceived from a distance in the open they run but a short distance at\r\na time, pausing frequently to turn round and scrutinize the object of\r\ntheir alarm. In this case there are generally one or two bulls keeping\r\nat some distance in the rear of the herd, whose fatal curiosity will\r\noften delay them until they fall victims to the rifle.\r\n\r\n“The speed of this Antelope is very great, and when thoroughly alarmed\r\nthey will cover the roughest ground in the most airy and graceful\r\nfashion, striking the earth with all four feet together, and springing\r\nup with immense bounds like an india-rubber ball. Their tenacity of\r\nlife is also remarkable, and I have known them travel a long distance\r\nwith several bullets in different parts of their bodies. The hunter who\r\nwould be successful must in consequence possess a good rifle and hold\r\nit very straight.\r\n\r\n“They vary in colour from a light tawny red to chestnut. Age has\r\nprobably something to do with this, though the males are usually darker\r\nthan the females, and they are inferior both in size and strength to\r\n_B. jacksoni_ further north.\r\n\r\n“The cows calve during the latter part of November and December, and on\r\nseveral occasions I have come across their young lying concealed in the\r\nlong grass, whilst the anxious mother was watching the proceedings from\r\na short distance.”\r\n\r\nOur coloured illustration of this species (Plate III.) has been\r\nprepared by Mr. Smit from a mounted specimen in the British Museum,\r\nwhich was brought from the Kilimanjaro district by Mr. F.

Suborbital gland\r\npresent, and provided with a distinct tuft. General colour brownish\r\nfulvous, darker than in any of the previous species; face with a black\r\nblaze running up to the horns, but interrupted between the eyes; back\r\nof neck with a dark line from the horns to the withers; chin blackish,\r\nouter sides of shoulders and hips black. These darker markings are not\r\nvisible in the young. Lower part of rump behind whitish or yellowish,\r\ncontrasting markedly with its dark upperside.\r\n\r\nSkull with the frontal part excessively elongated and narrow.\r\nThe measurements of a fine skull in the Leyden Museum are as\r\nfollows:--basal length 17·6 inches, greatest breadth 6·1, orbit to tip\r\nof muzzle 12·7; facial length 19·3, breadth of forehead below horns 5·1.\r\n\r\nHorns diverging evenly outwards at their bases, so as to form a V when\r\nviewed from the front, then curved forwards and upwards, and finally\r\nbent sharply backwards so as to form almost an abrupt right angle\r\nbehind the last bend. Good horns attain a length of about 22 or 24\r\ninches.\r\n\r\n   _Hab._ South Africa, south of the Limpopo River, but extending\r\n   further north along the edge of the Kalahari Desert. Now nearly\r\n   extinct in the Cape Colony; still found in the Transvaal.\r\n\r\nThe Hartebeest was well known to Sparrmann and other travellers in the\r\nCape Colony at the close of the last century. It was figured by Buffon\r\nin one of the supplementary volumes to his ‘Histoire Naturelle’ as the\r\n“_Caama ou Bubale_,” but was generally confounded by systematists with\r\nthe Bubal of North Africa, until Georges Cuvier, in 1816, gave it the\r\nname of _Antilope caama_--“_Caama_” or “_Khama_” being the term applied\r\nto it by the Bechuanas. In the days of Sparrmann the Hartebeest was\r\nvery abundant all over the Cape Colony, and was found in large troops\r\neven in the immediate vicinity of Cape Town.\r\n\r\nIn 1811, when Burchell visited South Africa, the Hartebeest appears to\r\nhave become already much less abundant; but Burchell speaks of having\r\nmet with it on the Gariep or Orange River and in other localities.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five years later, when Harris made his celebrated sporting\r\nexcursions into South Africa, the Hartebeest had retreated still\r\nfurther into the interior. But Harris speaks of it as being at that\r\ndate still met with on the plains beyond the Orange River “in immense\r\nherds.” Sir Andrew Smith, who visited the Cape Colonies at about the\r\nsame epoch, and who has figured the male of this Antelope in his\r\nwell-known ‘Illustrations of the Zoology of South Africa,’ speaks\r\nof the occurrence of the Hartebeest far in the interior. He killed\r\nspecimens himself close to the Tropic of Capricorn, and had heard\r\nof its occurrence much further northwards. But, according to his\r\nobservations, _Bubalis caama_ begins to get rare as soon as the\r\nSassaby (_Damaliscus lunatus_) commences to occur. His experience\r\njustified him in pronouncing that the former took the place of the\r\nlatter in all the territory northward of 25° south latitude. Sir Andrew\r\nSmith gives the following account of the habits of the Hartebeest:--\r\n\r\n“The Hartebeest, by preference, inhabits an open country, and hence is\r\ngenerally observed upon the plains in small herds consisting of from\r\nsix to ten individuals, and often, where the plains are extensive, many\r\nof such groups are to be seen within the range of the eye. It is a very\r\nwary animal, and views with strong suspicion the advance of man, so\r\nthat, unless favoured by special circumstances, he finds it an animal\r\ndifficult to procure. When disturbed, the herd generally scampers off\r\nin the train of some acknowledged leader, and they are rarely seen\r\nwhen flying, except in a string, one animal upon the heels of another.\r\nTheir pace is a sort of heavy gallop, and though they do not appear to\r\nmove with rapidity, yet the ground over which they go in a given time\r\nshows that their progressive motion is far from slow. When first they\r\nstart, they appear extremely awkward, and generate in the observer an\r\nimpression that to overtake them must be no very difficult task. After\r\nthey have advanced a little, however, the apparent stiffness in the\r\njoints of the hinder extremities disappears, and even the indications\r\nof weakness of the hinder limbs become so indistinct, that the pursuer\r\nis soon satisfied of the inaccuracy of his first conclusion. This and\r\nthe Sassaby are the only antelopes of South Africa which exhibit the\r\npeculiarity alluded to, and have led many to remark their resemblance\r\nin this respect to the Hyænas and Aard Wolf (_Proteles lalandii_).\r\nIn all these animals there is a disproportion between the development\r\nof the anterior and posterior parts of the body, and each of them\r\nappears when in motion as if its hinder extremities were too weak for\r\nthe duties they are destined to perform.”\r\n\r\nWe now come to the distribution of the Hartebeest in South Africa in\r\nmore modern days. Mr. T. E. Buckley, who published some interesting\r\nnotes on the range of the large Mammals in South Africa in the\r\nZoological Society’s ‘Proceedings’ for 1876 and 1877, tells us that\r\nfrom being one of the commonest animals throughout the Cape Colony it\r\nhad then become one of the rarest. He observed it only on three or\r\nfour occasions during his journey into the interior--once just before\r\nreaching the Crocodile River, and once or twice in the Colony of\r\nNatal. In the south-east he says a few then still remained in the Zulu\r\ncountry, but he could not hear of its occurrence in Swaziland, where\r\nits place seemed to be taken by the Sassaby.\r\n\r\nIn 1881 the renowned hunter, Mr. F. C. Selous, in his “Field\r\nNotes on the Antelopes of Central South Africa,” read before the\r\nZoological Society, described the present abode of the Hartebeest as\r\nfollows:--“The range of this Antelope is very similar to that of the\r\nGemsbuck. It is still found in Griqualand West, in some parts being\r\nfairly plentiful. All along the eastern border of the Kalahari desert\r\nit is also to be found, and extends as far east as the river Serule on\r\nthe road from Bamangwato to Tati. In the neighbourhood of the salt-pans\r\nlying between the Botletlie river and the road from Bamangwato to the\r\nZambesi it is very plentiful and may be met with in large herds. It\r\ndoes not, however, extend its range to the north of these salt-pans,\r\nand is unknown in all the country between the Chobe and Mababe rivers,\r\nas it is also in the Matabele and Mashuna countries. It is very fleet\r\nand enduring, and only second in these particulars to the Tsessebe.”\r\n\r\nOur figure of this species was lithographed on the stone by Mr. J. Smit\r\nfrom a sketch made by Joseph Wolf, but we have been unable to ascertain\r\nfrom what exact specimen the sketch was taken.\r\n\r\nThere is a stuffed example of the Cape Hartebeest in the British\r\nMuseum, obtained by the late Sir Andrew Smith during his journey\r\nto the Cape, probably the individual from which his figure in the\r\n‘Illustrations’ was taken. There are also other specimens in the same\r\ncollection, including the head of the curious hybrid between this\r\nspecies and the Sassaby (_Damaliscus lunatus_) described by Mr.\r\nSelous in 1893.\r\n\r\nThe Cape Hartebeest, though occasionally seen in zoological gardens,\r\nhas never been a common animal in captivity. The Zoological Society\r\nof London received a single example in 1851, and a fine male in 1861,\r\npresented by Sir George Grey, then Governor of the Cape Colony. In 1869\r\na pair were obtained by purchase.\r\n\r\nIn May 1890 the Society acquired a good pair of Hartebeests imported\r\nfrom the Transvaal by the well-known dealer, Mr. C. Reiche, of Alfeld,\r\nin Hanover. These are still living in the Regent’s Park Gardens.\r\n\r\n    _May, 1894._\r\n\r\n\r\n                       7.

The body-colours of _B. jacksoni_ are, however, not yet\r\naccurately known, so that it is possible that other differences will\r\nhereafter be found to exist.\r\n\r\nSkull: basal length 16 inches, greatest breadth 5·7, orbit to muzzle\r\n12·7; facial length 17·5, breadth of forehead 4·2.\r\n\r\n   _Hab._ Interior of British Central Africa, north of Lake\r\n   Baringo; Uganda; and probably extending northwards to the White\r\n   Nile, and westwards into North-east Congoland.\r\n\r\nThis Hartebeest, which is the northern representative of _B.\r\ncaama_, has been most appropriately named after Mr. Frederick John\r\nJackson, F.Z.S., the successful conductor of the expedition of the\r\nImperial British East African Company to Uganda in 1889 and 1890[5],\r\nand the discoverer of the species, which, when previously met with,\r\nhad always been confounded with other members of the genus. It should\r\nbe recollected that, besides his merits as a geographical explorer,\r\nMr. Jackson is an ardent zoological collector and observer. The\r\nsplendid series of birds which he obtained during the expedition just\r\nspoken of, and which embraced examples of nearly 300 species, has\r\nbeen described by Dr. R. Bowdler Sharpe in five papers published in\r\n‘The Ibis’ for 1891 and 1892. Dr. Sharpe’s account of this remarkable\r\ncollection is rendered still more complete by Mr. Jackson’s excellent\r\nfield-notes which accompany it. Mr. Jackson has also published some\r\nvery interesting remarks on the Antelopes of British East Africa in one\r\nof the recently issued volumes of the Badminton Library upon ‘Big Game\r\nShooting.’\r\n\r\nIf we assume, as is probable, that the Hartebeest of the Bahr-el-Ghazal\r\nbelongs to this species, the first examples of it sent to Europe would\r\nbe those obtained by Petherick in 1859, which were referred by the\r\nlate Dr. Gray to the Bubal of North Africa. Of these specimens the\r\nonly one retained by the British Museum is the skull of a female.\r\nAnother similar specimen from the Bahr-el-Ghazal was sent to the\r\nBritish Museum in 1884 by the German collector Bohndorff. Heuglin also\r\n(Reise N.O.-Afr. ii. p. 123) has spoken of the occurrence, on the Kir\r\nand Sobat rivers, of a Hartebeest allied to _B. caama_ of South\r\nAfrica. It is quite clear, therefore, that either Jackson’s Hartebeest\r\nor a species closely allied to it is found in the White-Nile district,\r\nalthough we must await the arrival of fresh specimens from this\r\ncountry and further information before we can decide exactly what this\r\nHartebeest is.\r\n\r\nIt is also probable that the “Central African Hartebeest” of Dr.\r\nSchweinfurth’s ’Im Herzen von Africa,’ and Junker’s “_Bubalis\r\ncaama_,” met with in the Niam-Niam country, on the northern\r\ntributaries of the Congo, should both be referred to _Bubalis\r\njacksoni_.\r\n\r\nThomas’s original characters of _Bubalis jacksoni_ were based on a\r\nspecimen transmitted by Mr. Jackson to Messrs. Rowland Ward & Co., shot\r\nin November 1889 in Northern Kavirondo, which is now in the British\r\nMuseum. In a note accompanying the specimen, in which he expresses a\r\nsagacious doubt as to “its being the same as the South-African animal,”\r\nMr. Jackson adds:--“Up north all along the top of the Elgeyo Escarpment\r\n(continuation of Mau) into Turquel to the north and north-east of Mount\r\nElgon it is very common, and takes the place of _B. cokei_. Round\r\nBaringo it is fairly plentiful, but some marches south of Njemps _B.\r\ncokei_ takes its place.”\r\n\r\nMr. Ernest Gedge, who accompanied Mr. Jackson in his adventurous\r\nexpedition, has kindly furnished us with the following excellent\r\nfield-notes on this Antelope:--\r\n\r\n“The first specimens of Jackson’s Hartebeest were obtained on the Mau\r\nplateau in British East Africa. This plateau extends in a northern and\r\nsoutherly direction through the Masai country, and varies from 8000 to\r\n9000 feet in elevation.\r\n\r\n“West of Lake Naivasha the plateau is covered for the most part with\r\ndense, almost impenetrable forests, but farther north the scenery\r\nbecomes more park-like, the forest clumps being intersected with grassy\r\nranches, which open out on to the broad expanse of the Angata Nyuki,\r\nthe latter extending right up to the eastern boundaries of Kavirondo.\r\nThe whole of this district is frequented by _B. jacksoni_, which\r\nis also found north of Lake Naivasha in the localities bordering\r\non Lakes Nakuro and Baringo north and west of these points; again,\r\nit inhabits the Suk country, Chibchangnani, Turquel, Karamojo, and\r\npossibly Turkana; whilst farther west it is common in the district\r\nround Mount Elgon, and is generally met with throughout Upper\r\nKavirondo, Usoga, and Uganda, wherever the conditions are favourable.\r\n\r\n“I have seldom encountered _B. jacksoni_ in large herds, though\r\nin habits it differs very little from other species of Hartebeest.\r\nMore frequently it is met with in small groups, in twos and threes,\r\nor singly. It would appear to change its locality to a very great\r\nextent according to the seasons. Thus, during the dry months of the\r\nyear it will be found plentifully scattered over the highlands, from\r\nwhence it retreats to the low country at the approach of the rains.\r\nIn illustration of this, I would mention that when on my journey to\r\nEngland in 1892, in the month of December, the lowlands at the foot\r\nof the escarpment were almost entirely deserted, whilst on the high\r\nplateau above I met with these Antelopes in great numbers.\r\n\r\n“On my return journey in the month of July of the following year the\r\nAngata Nyuki had become very swampy, owing to the heavy rains, and\r\nwas entirely deserted, save by one or two odd specimens, whereas the\r\ndistrict around Lake Nakuro, in the low country, was fairly overrun by\r\nthese Antelopes.\r\n\r\n“When herding together these animals are commonly found (like _B.\r\ncokei_) in company with Zebras and other Antelopes, and I have\r\nfrequently come across and shot Topi (_Damaliscus jimela_) amongst\r\nthem, the latter being very numerous in the province of Buddu in Uganda.\r\n\r\n“Like all Hartebeests, _B. jacksoni_ is, as a rule, very shy\r\nand difficult to approach--though, on one occasion, having gone\r\nconsiderably to the south of the ordinary caravan-route across the\r\nAngata Nyuki, I not only met with them in great numbers, but they were\r\nso little alarmed by my appearance in so unfrequented a locality, that\r\nthey allowed me to walk right up to them, and even when fired at only\r\nran for a short distance. They do not appear to patronize the bush\r\ncountry like _B. cokei_, though they frequent its vicinity.\r\n\r\n“I remarked this specially when in Uganda, for on the only occasions on\r\nwhich I encountered _B. jacksoni_ there it was confined to certain\r\nopen portions of the country bordering the Nile and a flat open plain\r\nof some 10 miles in diameter to the south of the Katonga River in the\r\nBuddu district, where I found it accompanied by Topi, Waterbuck, and\r\nKob.\r\n\r\n“It also, from all accounts, frequents the open tablelands bordering\r\nUnyoro and the Albert Nyanza, as well as the province of Bulamweze in\r\nUganda, which presents somewhat similar characteristics.\r\n\r\n“In appearance _B. jacksoni_ is larger and more strongly built\r\nthan _B. cokei_, and varies in colour from a light golden brown\r\nto a dark tawny red, its coat being beautifully fine and glossy. It is\r\neasily distinguished by the great length of its head and the peculiar\r\nset of its horns, which rise almost perpendicularly from the frontal\r\nbones, and curve sharply backwards near the tips at almost a right\r\nangle.\r\n\r\n“These Antelopes possess great tenacity of life, and I have known one\r\nto get clean away though struck with two 577 express bullets. On the\r\nother hand, if fairly hit in a vital spot they die very easily. The\r\ncows calve in November and December, and, so far as one can judge, give\r\nbirth to only one at a time. The calves themselves are very hardy and\r\nvigorous little animals; and I have known of one, which could not have\r\nbeen born more than a week or so at the most, completely out-distance\r\none of my men who tried to run it down in the open--and this in spite\r\nof the fact that one leg was partially deformed; but this may have been\r\nan exceptional instance.\r\n\r\n“The Wa-Soga and Wa-Ganda dress the skins of these Antelopes very\r\ncleverly, turning them out as soft as wash-leather, and quite equal to\r\nanything that can be done in the London market.”\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 5.\r\n\r\n  Front view of head of Jackson’s Hartebeest. 1/7 nat. size.]\r\n\r\nAs already pointed out, the horns of _B. jacksoni_ present a very\r\ngeneral resemblance to those of its southern ally _B. caama_, and\r\nare at once distinguishable from those of the other members of the\r\ngenus by the extreme elongation of the pedicle. But the horns of _B.\r\njacksoni_ are not quite so abruptly bent backwards as those of\r\n_B. caama_, and its head is at once distinguishable from that of\r\nthe Cape species by the entire absence of black on the face.\r\n\r\nNo complete specimen of the skin of _B. jacksoni_ having as yet\r\nbeen received, we are unable to give a coloured figure of this animal;\r\nbut the accompanying woodcut (fig. 5, p. 43) represents the typical\r\nskull of this species in the British Museum.\r\n\r\nThere are no other specimens of this Antelope in the National\r\nCollection, except the doubtful heads of Petherick and Bohndorff\r\nalready referred to.\r\n\r\n    _May, 1894._\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    THE BOOK OF ANTELOPES.

Chin, the usual\r\ntail-crest, and the front of the lower part of all four limbs black.\r\nLower part of rump white or pale yellowish, contrasting markedly with\r\nthe dark rufous of its upper surface. No anteorbital tuft present.\r\nHairs of face reversed upwards from muzzle to horns, except on a median\r\npatch, about four inches long, between the eyes, where they slant\r\ndownwards.\r\n\r\nSkull with but little frontal elongation, the elevation bearing the\r\nhorns much broader and shorter than in the majority of the true\r\nHartebeests; on the other hand, the muzzle is unusually lengthened, so\r\nthat the total facial length is about equal to that of _B. caama_.\r\nBasal length 14·7 inches, greatest breadth 7·2, muzzle to orbit 11·5,\r\nlength of face 17, breadth of forehead 6·1.\r\n\r\nHorns comparatively short and thick, curved first outwards, then\r\nupwards and inwards, and finally abruptly bent backwards, their\r\nterminal portions nearly or quite parallel with each other, and\r\ncomparatively close together. The largest horns are just 20 inches in\r\nlength.\r\n\r\n   _Hab._ East Africa, north of the Sabi River, throughout\r\n   Nyasaland and Mozambique to Usagara, opposite Zanzibar.\r\n\r\nThe late Dr. Wilhelm Peters, a distinguished zoologist, who explored\r\ndifferent parts of the Portuguese territory of Mozambique from 1842\r\nto 1848, was the discoverer of this Antelope, which he named after\r\nLichtenstein, his not less celebrated predecessor in the keepership\r\nof the Royal Museum of Berlin, and a former well-known authority on\r\nthis group of mammals. Peters gives as its locality the provinces of\r\nTette, Sena, and Boror, from the 16th to the 18th degree of south\r\nlatitude; and Sir John Kirk, in his notes on the ‘Mammals of Zambesi,’\r\npublished in 1864, says that “it is very common during the dry season\r\nin the forest of Shupanga and in Inhamunha, in small herds.” South of\r\nthe Zambesi Lichtenstein’s Hartebeest appears to extend as far as the\r\nPungue and Sabi Rivers. Messrs. Nicholls and Eglinton tell us that\r\nit is plentiful on the eastern course of the Sabi; and Mr. Buckley\r\nmet with it in the rough grassy plains of the Upper Pungue Valley, in\r\nherds sometimes of considerable size. Mr. Buckley always observed these\r\nAntelopes on the open veldt, and found that they kept clear of the more\r\nhilly and timbered country.\r\n\r\nThe great hunter, Mr. F. C. Selous, met with this Antelope only on\r\nthe open downs of the Manica plateau, north of the Zambesi, where it\r\nis called the “Konze.” He was a little doubtful about its identity\r\nwith the “Inkulanondo” of South-eastern Mashunaland; but we believe\r\nthat both the native names last mentioned refer alike to _Bubalis\r\nlichtensteini_. Mr. Selous makes the following remarks upon this\r\nspecies (P. Z. S. 1881, p. 764):--\r\n\r\n“The Konze very closely resembles the Hartebeest of South Africa; the\r\nhorns, however, are shorter and flatter at the base, and the forehead\r\nis not nearly so elongated. The black mark down the front of the face\r\nof the Hartebeest is also wanting in the Konze, where the colour is\r\nof a uniform light red. The general colour of the animal is a little\r\nlighter than that of the Hartebeest, the tail, knees, and front of all\r\nfour legs being black. As in the Hartebeest, there is a patch of pale\r\nyellow on the rump; and the insides of thighs and belly are also of a\r\nvery pale yellow. One old bull that I shot was of very rich dark red\r\ncolour all along the back and the upper part of the sides. About a\r\nhand’s breadth behind each shoulder was a patch of dark grey about six\r\ninches in diameter. A female that I shot also had these grey patches\r\nbehind the shoulders. In two other full-grown males these patches were\r\nwanting.”\r\n\r\nThroughout Nyasaland, so far as it has yet been explored,\r\nLichtenstein’s Antelope appears to be an abundant species; and Mr. R.\r\nCrawshay, our principal authority on the Antelopes of this country,\r\ntells us (P. Z. S. 1890, p. 663) that it is very generally met with\r\nin the hills, if not too steep and rocky, and also in the plains, but\r\nappears to prefer a flat or undulating woody district with intervening\r\nopen glades. Mr. Crawshay adds the following account of his personal\r\nexperience with this Antelope:--\r\n\r\n“In 1883 I first met with this Antelope on the plains between the\r\nKiwira and Insesi Rivers, in Makyusa’s country, at the north-west of\r\nthe lake; there were just three in the troop, and with the help of\r\nanother gentleman I was lucky enough to kill one--a nearly full-grown\r\nbull. In 1885 I saw several herds of these animals to the south-east of\r\nNyasa, and between it and Lake Shirwa, and from all accounts they must\r\nbe plentiful in the Yao country, to the east of the lake.\r\n\r\n“On the West Coast, later in the same year, I came across a good many\r\non the Kanjamwana River, and between Amuwa and Mpemba’s: here they\r\nusually consorted with Impalas; but on the same plains there were\r\nalso to be seen in their company, from time to time, Water-bucks,\r\nReed-bucks, and occasionally Koodoos and Elands. Inland from Bana to\r\nthe north again, I was told there were Hartebeests, and I saw some\r\nheads of animals said to have been killed there.\r\n\r\n“In 1889–90 I repeatedly saw a few in the low red-sandstone hills to\r\nthe north of Chombi, between Makwawa’s and Afunanchenga’s, on the\r\nHara River; here they generally went in company with Water-bucks or\r\nZebras, and once I noticed three Hartebeests herding and feeding in the\r\nmidst of some thirty or forty Water-bucks, all cows. Between Nkanga\r\nand Karonga’s, on the coast-line, and in all the intervening country\r\nbetween that and the Anyika Mountains, Hartebeests are commonly met\r\nwith, notably at Vuwa, Mrali, and Taowira. At Nkanga, during my stay\r\nthere, a cow was killed in a game-pit, and of this animal I secured the\r\nhorns and frontal bone. As a rule, I have seen Hartebeests in herds\r\nnumbering from half a dozen or even less to perhaps fifteen or twenty,\r\nbut I never remember having come across more than that number. This\r\nAntelope possesses extraordinary vitality, and in this respect is very\r\nlittle behind the Water-buck.”\r\n\r\nMr. B. L. Sclater, R.E., who has recently passed two years in the Shiré\r\nHighlands, and has traversed nearly every part of that district[6],\r\ninforms us that he considers this Hartebeest to be the commonest of\r\nthe larger Antelopes there, after the Waterbuck. He met with it in all\r\nparts of the country, more frequently in the open districts, but also\r\nin the wooded valley of the Shiré, sometimes singly, and at other times\r\nin larger or smaller herds. On the Tochila plains under Mount Milanji,\r\nat an elevation of about 2000 feet, in November 1891 he saw a large\r\nherd of this Antelope mixed with Zebras.\r\n\r\nFrom Nyasaland, so far as we can make out, Lichtenstein’s Antelope\r\nextends northwards to the plains of the Wami River opposite Zanzibar,\r\nwhere Sir John Kirk procured specimens, which are now in his\r\ncollection. In the hills of Usagara, north-east of this district,\r\n_B. lichtensteini_ is replaced by _B. cokei_, as already\r\nmentioned in our article on the latter species. Herr P. Matschie,\r\nof Berlin, considers the Hartebeest of German East Africa, which he\r\nsays extends as far north as the Pangani River, to be different from\r\n_B. lichtensteini_ (although he admits that the horns of the two\r\nspecies very closely resemble each other), and proposes to call it\r\n_B. leucoprymnus_. We are not, however, with due respect to Herr\r\nMatschie’s views, yet prepared to recognize _B. leucoprymnus_\r\nas distinct from _B. lichtensteini_, though we fully admit the\r\npossibility of being obliged hereafter, by future evidence, to alter\r\nour opinion on this point.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 6 _a_.\r\n\r\n  Skull of _Bubalis lichtensteini_, ♂.\r\n\r\n  (Brooke.)]\r\n\r\nThe main distinguishing feature of Lichtenstein’s Hartebeest is the\r\nshort and thick basal portion of its horns, which induces us to place\r\nit in a section by itself, and which renders it easily recognizable\r\nfrom the seven preceding species of this genus. This character is well\r\nshown in the accompanying woodcuts (figs. 6 _a_ and 6 _b_).\r\nFigure 6 _a_, prepared under the superintendence of Sir Victor\r\nBrooke, shows the skull of a male of this species; fig. 6 _b_,\r\np. 50 (which has been kindly lent to us by the Zoological Society of\r\nLondon) represents, as we now believe, the skull of a female, though\r\noriginally supposed by Mr. Crawshay to belong to a young male.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 6 _b_.\r\n\r\n  Skull of _Bubalis lichtensteini_, ♀.\r\n\r\n  (P. Z. S. 1890, p. 662.)]\r\n\r\nOur coloured figure of this Antelope (Plate V.) was prepared by Mr.\r\nSmit from a male specimen (now in the British Museum) which was shot on\r\nthe River Sabi by Mr. Selous in July 1885. Besides this, the National\r\nCollection contains a stuffed female from the same locality, and a\r\nseries of skulls and skins from Nyasaland, transmitted by Mr. H.

It is, however, as already pointed out,\r\nquite different from all the other species of both these genera in the\r\nshape of its horns, and is also unique in exhibiting the curious white\r\nline between the eyes across the forehead, which renders it easily\r\nrecognizable.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 7 _b_.\r\n\r\n  Skull and horns of _Damaliscus hunteri_, ♂ ad.\r\n\r\n  (P.

S. 1889, p. 375.)]\r\n\r\nHunter’s Antelope has been called after its discoverer Mr. H. C. V.\r\nHunter, F.Z.S., who met with it under the following circumstances:--\r\n\r\nIn the year after Sir Robert Harvey’s celebrated sporting-expedition\r\nto Kilimanjaro (in 1886–87), of which Sir John Willoughby has given\r\nus the history in his well-known volume on ‘East Africa and its Big\r\nGame,’ Sir Robert returned to Mombasa in company with Mr. Greenfield\r\nand Mr. Hunter, and, after another visit to the “Hunter’s Paradise of\r\nTaveta,” near Kilimanjaro, made a second trip, in quest of sport, up\r\nthe valley of the River Tana, which forms the northern boundary of\r\nthe dominions of the Imperial British East-African Company. Of this\r\nexcursion Sir Robert prepared a short account, which has been printed\r\nas an appendix to the above-mentioned work. The party arrived at the\r\nmouth of the Tana in September, and proceeded up the river in boats to\r\nGolbanto, where they were hospitably received at the mission-station\r\non the river. Leaving Golbanto on September 28th they reached, about\r\nten days later, a village called Durani, some 150 miles from the mouth\r\nof the river. Here on the north bank Mr. Hunter, on October 16th,\r\nshot the first specimen of the Antelope which now bears his name, and\r\nimmediately proceeded to take the photograph of its head, from which\r\nthe accompanying engraving (fig. 7 _a_, p. 54) was taken. Other\r\nexamples of this species were subsequently procured by Mr. Hunter and\r\nMr. Greenfield. These include two heads (male and female) which are now\r\nin Sclater’s custody, and on which he established the species, and the\r\nmounted specimen which is now in the gallery of the British Museum. We\r\nare not aware that besides the examples procured on this occasion any\r\nother specimens of this rare and interesting Antelope have ever been\r\nbrought to Europe.\r\n\r\nThe female Hunter’s Antelope differs from the male in its rather\r\nsmaller size and in its longer and more slender horns, as shown in the\r\naccompanying woodcuts (figs. 7 _b_ and 7 _c_) kindly lent to\r\nus by the Zoological Society of London.\r\n\r\nMr. Hunter’s field notes on this Antelope (as supplied by him to\r\nSclater) are as follows:--\r\n\r\n“We first met with this Antelope about 150 miles up the Tana River. It\r\nis only found for certain on the north bank of the river. It frequents\r\nthe grassy plains principally, but I have also often seen it in thin\r\nthorny bush. It is generally met with in herds of from 15 to 25\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\n“At the time of the year when I came across them (October and November)\r\nI saw several young ones in the herds. The banks of the Tana River are\r\nfringed with a thin belt of forest, then the ground rises slightly and\r\none sees extensive plains dotted here and there with large patches of\r\nbush, composed principally of euphorbias and aloes. The Lesser Koodoo\r\n(_Strepsiceros imberbis_) lives principally in these patches,\r\nand feeds outside of them in the early mornings and evenings. When I\r\nfirst saw the new Antelope I was stalking two examples of _Gazella\r\nwalleri_, and though I saw the Hunter’s Antelope in the distance I\r\nmistook them for Impálas, which, however, are not found on the Tana on\r\neither bank.\r\n\r\n“It was only when I fired at the Gazelles, and the Hunter’s Antelopes\r\n(a pair of young males) ran away, that I noticed that they were\r\nsomething new to me. They ran with rather a heavy gallop, like a\r\nHartebeest. I then had a very long track after them, and managed to\r\nkill the young male which I first sent you.\r\n\r\n“We did not come across these Antelopes again for some days, but then\r\nmet with them in large numbers and got several specimens. They seemed\r\nto me to have more vitality than any other Antelope I have ever killed.\r\nThis species certainly does not extend down to the coast, but we saw\r\nthem as far as the furthest point we reached (about 250 miles) up the\r\nriver, at a place called Mussa.

General colour reddish fawn, with distinct black patches\r\non face, shoulders, hips, and thighs. No dorsal dark line, and no dark\r\nmarkings on feet. Tail barely reaching to hock, its terminal third with\r\na blackish crest along the top.\r\n\r\nSkull heavily built; its basal length (♂) 14·8 inches, greatest breadth\r\n5·7, muzzle to eye 10·8.\r\n\r\nHorns thick, rising abruptly upwards and backwards from the skull, and\r\nevenly curving backwards, diverging as they go; their extreme tips\r\nshowing a tendency to be recurved upwards. Good male horns are of a\r\nlength over the curves of 21 inches.\r\n\r\nThis and the two next species are very closely allied in all their\r\nessential characters; but their colour-differences appear to be\r\nsufficiently constant in their respective localities to entitle them to\r\nspecific recognition.\r\n\r\n   _Hab._ Senegambia and the interior of West Africa.\r\n\r\nThe Antelope described by Buffon, in his ‘Histoire Naturelle,’ as\r\nthe “Koba”[7] or “Grande Vache Brune” of Senegal, has proved a great\r\nstumbling-block to naturalists. This has been largely due to the fact\r\nthat Buffon appended to his description of the Koba the figure of some\r\nhorns from a totally different source, and clearly of a different\r\nanimal, which, indeed, we believe to have been simply those of the\r\nPallah (_Æpyceros melampus_). Not noticing this confusion, many\r\ngood authorities have identified the Koba with the present species,\r\nwhile others have been inclined to refer it, owing to the figure of\r\nthe horns erroneously given by Buffon, to the Bontebok of the Cape and\r\nto other Antelopes. The description by itself is quite unrecognizable,\r\nand under the circumstances, as the matter must ever remain uncertain,\r\nthe best course seems to be to ignore Buffon’s animal altogether,\r\nand to reject the specific names _koba_ and _senegalensis_\r\nthat have been founded upon it; although there can be no doubt that\r\nthe Korrigum, as now described, is the _Antilope_ and _Damalis\r\nsenegalensis_ of Children, Hamilton Smith, Gray, and many other\r\nauthors.\r\n\r\nThis being decided, the proper name to adopt for this Antelope will be\r\n_korrigum_ of Ogilby. Ogilby proposed this name in a communication\r\nmade to the Zoological Society of London in 1836, basing it on the head\r\nand horns brought home from Bornou by Denham and Clapperton on their\r\nreturn from their celebrated expedition into Central Africa in 1822–24.\r\nThis skull is still in the collection of the British Museum.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1840 Whitfield, a collector employed by Lord Derby to\r\nprocure living animals for his private Menagerie, obtained specimens\r\nof the Korrigum from the vicinity of Macarthy’s Island on the River\r\nGambia, and brought them safely to Knowsley. Here they seem to have\r\nthriven and reproduced their kind, for on reference to the ‘Gleanings’\r\n(published in 1850) there will be found a beautiful coloured figure by\r\nWaterhouse Hawkins of a mother and young of this Antelope drawn from\r\nlife. It is a great misfortune that so few records were ever kept or,\r\nat all events, ever published of the many fine and rare animals living\r\nin this splendid collection. In the Derby Museum, now at Liverpool, are\r\ntwo mounted specimens of this Antelope--we believe the only perfect\r\nexamples in this country. They are, no doubt, individuals formerly\r\nliving in the Knowsley Menagerie.\r\n\r\nHerr Matschie is inclined to believe that certain specimens of a\r\n_Damaliscus_ recently obtained by German collectors on the north\r\nand west of Lake Victoria should be referred to the present species,\r\nand not to _D. jimela_. This, if correct, would indicate a much\r\ngreater extension of the area of the Korrigum towards the east than we\r\nshould consider to be probable, and further evidence on the subject is\r\nmuch wanted.\r\n\r\nBesides the skulls of both sexes obtained in Bornou by Denham and\r\nClapperton, there are other skulls of this species in the National\r\nCollection, procured by Whitfield on the Gambia, and, more recently, in\r\nthe same district by Dr. Percy Rendall. We much regret that we have no\r\nfurther details to offer upon this fine and interesting Antelope, of\r\nthe life-history of which, as is the case with most of the West-African\r\nAntelopes, we know exceedingly little. The figure of this species\r\n(Plate VII.) was put upon the stone by Mr. Smit from a drawing by Mr.\r\nWolf, probably taken from the specimens at Liverpool; but upon this\r\npoint we are not quite certain.\r\n\r\n    _January, 1895._\r\n\r\n\r\n                            11.

General colour purplish\r\nred; the face, a line beneath the eye, another along the nape and back\r\nbrown or black; front of the limbs and tip of the tail deep black.\r\n\r\nSkull with a comparatively short nasal region, the nasal bones\r\nthemselves unusually short and broad. Measurements (♀):--basal length\r\n13·8 inches, greatest breadth 5·75, muzzle to eye 10·2.\r\n\r\nHorns as in the Korrigum; those of a female 20·5 inches in length over\r\nthe curve.\r\n\r\nThe colour-characters above given are taken from Heuglin’s description\r\nand figure, as no skin has been seen by us. A skull obtained by Consul\r\nPetherick on the Bahr-el-Ghazal has, however, furnished the cranial\r\ndimensions.\r\n\r\n   _Hab._ Sennaar, Kordofan, and Bahr-el-Ghazal.\r\n\r\nThe Tiang, as the well-known German traveller and naturalist Theodor\r\nvon Heuglin proposed to call this Antelope, after its native name, is\r\na representative form of the Korrigum in the upper valley of the Nile,\r\nand, so far as we are acquainted with it at present, agrees in all\r\nessential respects with its West-African ally, except in its slightly\r\nsmaller bulk, and some differences in the black markings on the face\r\nand limbs. The Tiang, Topi, and Korrigum have been until lately\r\ngenerally regarded as conspecific; but in 1892 Herr Paul Matschie, of\r\nthe Royal Natural History Museum of Berlin, came to the conclusion\r\nthat previous authors had been in error in uniting the present animal\r\nand its allied forms of West and East Africa respectively under one\r\nhead, and that they should be distinguished as different species. We\r\nfollow Herr Matschie’s lead on this question, and have little doubt\r\nthat his views will ultimately prove to be correct, although, from\r\nthe great scarcity of specimens of all these Antelopes in European\r\ncollections, it is not possible at present to arrive at a positive\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 8.\r\n\r\n  Skull of _Damaliscus tiang_, ♀.]\r\n\r\nThe Stockholm Museum appears to have been the first to receive examples\r\nof this Antelope; but Sundevall referred them first of all to the\r\nSassaby (_Bubalis lunata_), and, when he found that this was quite\r\nwrong, named them _Bubalis koba_, supposing them to be identical\r\nwith the West-African Korrigum. Sundevall’s specimens were received\r\nfrom Sennaar, and are accurately described in his classical memoir on\r\nthe “Pecora.”\r\n\r\nAs already mentioned, v. Heuglin met with this Antelope during\r\nhis lengthened explorations on the Upper Nile and its affluents.\r\nHe described it in his memoir on the Antelopes and Buffaloes of\r\nNorth-east Africa (published in 1863 in the ‘Nova Acta’ of the\r\nLeopoldino-Carolinian Academy) as _Damalis tiang_, and tells us\r\nthat it is one of the commonest Antelopes on the Sobat, Ghasal, and Kir\r\nrivers. He gives a coloured figure of its head. Whether v. Heuglin’s\r\n_Damalis tiang-riel_, described in the same memoir (based on some\r\nhorns from the Bahr el Abiad), is referable to the Tiang is not quite\r\ncertain, but Sclater, who has examined the horns upon which the species\r\nwas founded, now in the Naturalien-Cabinet of Stuttgardt, believes them\r\nto be so.\r\n\r\nThe only other explorer of these distant regions who has sent home\r\nexamples of the Tiang is, so far as we know, Petherick, from whom\r\nskulls of an immature male and an adult female of this Antelope were\r\nreceived by the British Museum in 1859. The latter are represented in\r\nthe accompanying figure (fig. 8).\r\n\r\nBesides Petherick, Sir Samuel Baker appears to have met with the Tiang\r\nduring his journey along the Upper Nile (see ‘Ismailia,’ i. pp. 68–74);\r\nand the _Antilope senegalensis_ of Emin Pasha (‘Reise-Briefen,’\r\np. 144), which he encountered near Magungo, on the Albert Nyanza, may\r\nprobably be referable to this species.\r\n\r\n    _January, 1895._\r\n\r\n\r\n                             12.

Fur very short and close,\r\nbut mingled with it there are numerous patches of longer hairs, so that\r\na somewhat brindled appearance is produced. General colour a peculiar\r\npurplish brown, blackish on face and chin, shoulders, and round the\r\nupper fore legs and thighs, but these darker markings are not really\r\nblack and are not sharply defined. Hams scarcely lighter than the rest.\r\nLimbs and feet without dark patches, except that the backs of the\r\npasterns are black.

Tail reaching just\r\nto the hock, its terminal half black-crested.\r\n\r\nSkull comparatively small, with an unusually long nasal region; the\r\nnasal bones very long and narrow. Basal length (♀) 13·3 inches,\r\ngreatest breadth 5·2, muzzle to orbit 9·5.\r\n\r\nHorns as in the Korrigum, but shorter and slenderer; those of a female\r\n16·4 inches in length.\r\n\r\n   _Hab._ British East-African coast, from the River Juba to the\r\n   River Sabaki, and extending thence into Uganda and Uniamwezi.\r\n\r\nThe “Topi,” as we propose to designate another local representative\r\nof the Korrigum, from the native name given to it by the Swahili, has\r\nbeen known for some years to the sportsmen who have visited British and\r\nGerman East Africa as an abundant Antelope in certain districts, and\r\nhas been generally called by them the “Senegal Antelope,” from being\r\nsupposed to be the same as the “Korrigum.” But, as Herr Matschie first\r\npointed out, it differs from the typical Senegal form in the absence of\r\nthe black band on the inner side of the thigh, in the front legs being\r\nblack down to the hoofs, and in the restriction of the black on the\r\nhinder flanks to the hips.\r\n\r\nSo far as we know, Sir John Kirk, then Consul-General at Zanzibar,\r\nwas the first to obtain examples of this fine Antelope on the East\r\nCoast. Sir John has kindly supplied us with the following notes on this\r\nspecies:--\r\n\r\n“The ‘Tope,’ or Senegal Antelope, was very common on the maritime plain\r\nof Formosa Bay when I first went to Zanzibar in 1866; before I left, in\r\n1886, it had become rather rare near the coast. On the maritime plain\r\nit used to be seen in numerous herds of from 5 to 20. The herds of\r\nTope generally kept alone, but you would see the herds of _Gazella\r\ngranti_ grazing near by. I am, however, not satisfied that this\r\nGazelle was the real _Gazella granti_, for the horns seem to show\r\na permanent difference of sweep.\r\n\r\n“However, to return to the Tope, I may say that I shot it again on the\r\nsouth bank of the River Juba.\r\n\r\n“The River Sabaki (near Malindi) is, so far as I know, the southern\r\nlimit of the species _on the coast_; I have little doubt that\r\nfurther inland it may be met with further south, just as you find the\r\nOryx, the Vulturine Guinea-fowl, and other species (which never occur\r\nsouth of the River Sabaki _on the coast_), to be common if you go\r\ninland, and in a latitude far south of Malindi, such as at Mpwapwa in\r\nUsagara.\r\n\r\n“The Tope was at one time so common near Witu, and in the district\r\nabout Lamu, as to supply a considerable number of hides that were\r\nexported from Zanzibar.”\r\n\r\nIn 1885 Mr. F. J. Jackson obtained examples of this Antelope near Lamu,\r\nand transmitted to Lord Walsingham a head, which Sclater exhibited at\r\none of the Zoological Society’s meetings in 1886. During his subsequent\r\nstay in British East Africa and on his journey to Uganda Mr. Jackson\r\nagain met with this Antelope, and tells us (‘Big Game Shooting,’ vol.\r\ni. p. 291) that it is the “commonest species in the Galla country, and\r\nranges from the coast right away N.E. to Uganda, passing round to the\r\nnorth of Mount Kenia, but is not known either in Leikipia or south of\r\nLake Baringo.”\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 9.\r\n\r\n  Skull of _Damaliscus jimela_, from Lamu.\r\n\r\n  (P. Z. S. 1890, p. 356.)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 9 _a_.\r\n\r\n  Head of _Damaliscus jimela_, from Malindi.\r\n\r\n  (P. Z. S. 1890, p. 355.)]\r\n\r\nIn 1890 Sclater exhibited at one of the meetings of the Zoological\r\nSociety a head of this Antelope obtained near Malindi by Commander\r\nMontgomerie, R.N.\r\n\r\nAt that time Sclater did not distinguish between this species and\r\nthe two allied forms, and referred them all three to _Damalis\r\nsenegalensis_, which he believed to extend from Senegal to the east\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\nMr. Ernest Gedge, the companion of Mr. Jackson in his Uganda\r\nexpedition, has favoured us with the following interesting notes on\r\nthis Antelope:--\r\n\r\n“Though the Topee ranges over a very wide extent of the country in\r\nthe sphere of British East Africa, it is met with in no great numbers\r\nbetween the coast and the Victoria Lake. The nearest point to the\r\ncoast-line at which I have seen and obtained specimens was a short\r\ndistance north of Kikumbuliu, on the borders of the Kiboko River. In\r\nthis district it is only occasionally met with, and is generally found\r\nin company with Hartebeest. Further north, in the vast plains amongst\r\nthe stony hills of Turquel and Karamojo, and round the bases of Mts.\r\nElgon and Lekakisera, it is fairly common, scattered in twos and threes\r\namongst the herds of Hartebeest. Further northwards, in the countries\r\nlying to the west and north of Uganda proper, and indeed throughout\r\nthe whole district bordering the Victoria Nyanza in this direction,\r\nit is very common, and on one occasion when traversing a plain of\r\nconsiderable extent in the district of Buddu I encountered several fine\r\nherds of this Antelope. It differs very little from the Hartebeest in\r\nits general habits, and, like them, it is usually shy and difficult to\r\napproach. It is easily distinguished from the latter species by the\r\nrich dark bluish-brown coat, the smaller head, and the shape of its\r\nhorns, which have, on more than one occasion, caused it to be mistaken\r\nfor the Sable Antelope (_Hippotragus niger_). It appears to be\r\nequally at home in swampy localities as on the dry open plains, though\r\nit shows a certain partiality for those districts which afford some\r\ncover.”\r\n\r\nPassing now to German East Africa, we find that this Antelope,\r\naccording to Herr Matschie, was met with by Böhm in Uniamwezi, south\r\nof Lake Victoria. Here it is the “Jimela” of the natives, which term\r\nHerr Matschie has adopted as its specific designation. In a recent\r\nletter, however, Herr Matschie tells Sclater that the specimens of this\r\nAntelope lately obtained by Herr Oscar Neumann in Kavirondo and other\r\nlocalities west of Lake Victoria, and by Lieut. Werther on the Rovana\r\nSteppe near Speke Gulf, more nearly resemble _D. korrigum_ of the\r\nWest Coast, but it seems to us hardly possible that the western form\r\nshould extend so far.\r\n\r\nIt is certain, however, that we have much more to learn concerning the\r\ndistribution of this Antelope and its allied forms before the question\r\nof their specific relations and the areas which they respectively\r\noccupy can be deemed settled.\r\n\r\nBesides the skull from the Juba, received from Sir John Kirk, the\r\nBritish Museum possesses a mounted specimen of the adult male of this\r\nAntelope obtained by Mr. Jackson in the Kilimanjaro district in 1893,\r\nand a flat skin procured by the same gentleman near Malindi.\r\n\r\n    _January, 1895._\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    THE BOOK OF ANTELOPES, PL.

Ground-colour of body, as seen on\r\nthe anterior half of the back, rufous fawn. Crown, sides of face and\r\nneck, flanks, thighs, and the anterior half of the rump darkened nearly\r\nor quite to black, which colour also runs down the limbs to the knee\r\nand hock, where it passes as a dark ring right round the limbs. Face\r\nwith a large strongly contrasted blaze of pure white, which covers the\r\nwhole breadth of its upper surface on the muzzle, but is much narrower\r\nabove the eyes, where it runs up to the bases of the horns. In the\r\nyoung the facial blaze is simply brown. Posterior half of rump, base of\r\ntail, belly, and lower limbs also white. Terminal half of tail, which\r\nreaches just to the hock, black-crested.\r\n\r\nHairs of face reversed upwards to horns. No glandular suborbital\r\nbrushes.\r\n\r\nSkull narrow and lightly built, its measurements about as in the next\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nHorns somewhat like those of _D. korrigum_ and its allies, but\r\ntheir bases more compressed and twisted inwards towards each other in\r\nfront; above they curve evenly backwards and outwards, their terminal\r\nfive or six inches again gently recurved upwards. Their ridges are 15\r\nor 16 in number, very prominent in front, less so on the sides and\r\nbehind; their substance is quite black. In length they attain 15 or 16\r\ninches, with a basal circumference of about 6.\r\n\r\n   _Hab._ Cape Colony, south of Vaal River (now nearly extinct).\r\n\r\nThe “Bontebok,” or “Pied Goat,” of the Dutch colonists of the Cape, was\r\namongst the earliest Antelopes known to science. In his first essay on\r\nthe genus _Antilope_, published in 1766, Pallas described it as\r\n_Antilope dorcas_, having confounded it with the _Dorcas_\r\nof Ælian. But in his second essay upon the same group, issued in\r\nthe following year, he selected for it the very appropriate name\r\n_pygarga_, by which it has been generally known ever since. The\r\nBontebok and Blessbok together constitute a distinct section of the\r\npresent genus, readily known from their congeners by their smaller\r\nstature and conspicuous white faces.\r\n\r\nLichtenstein, in his celebrated memoir on the genus _Antilope_,\r\npublished at Berlin in 1814, made _Antilope pygarga_ the tenth\r\nspecies of the genus, and gave original particulars of it from\r\nspecimens which he had himself obtained during his visit to South\r\nAfrica. He states, however, that this animal is the _Blessbok_,\r\nand not the _Bontebok_, of the Cape; and there can be no doubt\r\nthat both these names have been applied to it, though the former term\r\nis now by general consent restricted to the next following species,\r\n_Damaliscus albifrons_. For example, Smuts, in his ‘Enumeratio\r\nMammalium Capensium,’ gives both “Bontebok” and “Blessbok” as the\r\ncolonial names of the present species. In fact these animals were never\r\ncorrectly discriminated till Harris gave figures and descriptions\r\nof them in his ‘Portraits of the Game and Wild Animals of Southern\r\nAfrica,’ published in 1840.\r\n\r\nHarris tells us that in his time the Bontebok was “common” in the\r\ninterior of the Cape Colony, and was also found in one valley near Cape\r\nAgulhas. On the plains lying south of the Vaal River he visited the\r\nheadquarters of the Bontebok, where “thousands upon thousands were seen\r\nand numbers were daily slain.” They were frequently seen congregated on\r\nthe salt-flats, near the stagnant pools of brackish water, licking up\r\nthe crystallized efflorescence.\r\n\r\nThirty years later a very different tale was told of the Bontebok,\r\nwhich by that date had become nearly extinct except in one isolated\r\nspot. Mr. E. L. Layard (P. Z. S. 1871, p. 625) gives the following\r\naccount of this animal at that period:--“The Bontebok is very nearly\r\nexterminated, and, but for the fostering care of Messrs. Breda and Van\r\nder Byl, would be quite so in a couple of years.\r\n\r\n“They are now confined to one spot in the extreme south of the\r\ncontinent of South Africa, to a portion of the country called the\r\n‘Strand Veldt.’ It is an extensive flat, bordered by the sea on the\r\nsouth-west, south, and south-east, and by a range of undulating country\r\nor low hills rising to the Caledon Ranges and Zwart Bergen on the\r\nnorthern side. It is, in fact, the nearest plateau to the L’Agulhas\r\nBank, and is called ‘Cape L’Agulhas.’ The whole of this country belongs\r\nchiefly to the families of Breda and Van der Byl; and they preserve the\r\nanimals as much as they can. A Government permit is also required to\r\nshoot them, which must be visa’d by the magistrate at Bredasdorp, the\r\nname of the village on this range of land.\r\n\r\n“They are, however, poached and destroyed by one or two small holders,\r\nwho have patches of land surrounded by the large properties, and who\r\nrefuse all offers of purchase, and plant corn on purpose to tempt the\r\nanimals into it, and then at night shoot them. They roam in herds of\r\nabout eight or ten, or twenty; but sometimes fine old bucks are found\r\nsolitary. They are usually shot from a cart, which they will suffer to\r\napproach them, or from horseback. If wounded and approached they will\r\ncharge desperately; and I have heard of a Hottentot being killed by\r\nthem thus.”\r\n\r\nMessrs. Nicolls and Eglington in their ‘Sportsman in South Africa,’\r\nwhich contains the most recent account of the Antelopes of the Colony,\r\ntell us that the Bontebok can no longer “be considered as a part of the\r\nwild game of the country,” as it now exists only on Van der Byl’s farm\r\n(as mentioned by Mr. Layard) and has become totally extinct elsewhere.\r\n\r\nMr. H. A. Bryden, a well-known authority upon the game of the Cape,\r\ntells us the same story. One of the last resorts of this Antelope was\r\nthe Bontebok Flats, to the north of the present Queenstown district,\r\nwhere a few of these Antelopes existed up to 1851. It appears certain,\r\nhowever, that except in the farm above mentioned, where a few have been\r\ncarefully preserved for many years, the Bontebok is, at the present\r\ntime, an extinct animal.\r\n\r\nThe Bontebok was amongst the many splendid Antelopes that were to be\r\nseen in the celebrated Knowsley Menagerie, and which bred in that\r\nestablishment. The young is figured in one of Waterhouse Hawkins’s\r\nlarge plates in the ‘Gleanings,’ and the adult pair in another plate\r\nalong with the Blessbok.\r\n\r\nAt the dispersal of the Knowsley collection in 1851 a pair of adult\r\nBonteboks were purchased by Mr. D. W. Mitchell, then Secretary, for the\r\nZoological Society of London, whilst another pair, bred at Knowsley,\r\nwere sold to Prince Demidoff.\r\n\r\nIn August 1871 two females of this Antelope were brought home alive\r\nby the Captain of one of the Cape mail-steamers, and purchased by the\r\nZoological Society for £50. So far as I know, these were the last\r\nBonteboks ever brought to Europe.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 10.\r\n\r\n  _Damaliscus pygargus._]\r\n\r\nIn the National Collection, we regret to say, the Bontebok is only\r\nrepresented by a single stuffed specimen--a male, received in 1839 from\r\nDr. Smuts. There are also several skulls and horns of this Antelope,\r\nbut none of them are of recent date. We fear it will now be a matter\r\nof some difficulty to obtain fresh specimens of this once so abundant\r\nAntelope.\r\n\r\nThe coloured illustration of the Bontebok (Plate VIII.) and the woodcut\r\n(fig. 10) were both prepared under Sir Victor Brooke’s directions. The\r\nplate was lithographed by Smit from one of Mr. Wolf’s sketches.\r\n\r\n    _January, 1895._\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    THE BOOK OF ANTELOPES. PL.

Posterior half of rump not prominently white, a small area only\r\nround the base of the tail slightly paler than the rest.\r\n\r\nSkull and horns as in _D. pygargus_, except that the latter are of\r\na more or less whitish colour.\r\n\r\nSkull-measurements of a male:--basal length 11·5 inches, greatest\r\nbreadth 5·1, muzzle to orbit 8·3.\r\n\r\n   _Hab._ Northern plains of Cape Colony, Orange Free State,\r\n   Transvaal, and Bechuana-land (now nearly extinct).\r\n\r\nThe Blessbok, so called from the white blaze on its forehead (“_bles_”\r\nin Dutch), is of exactly the same form and general appearance as the\r\nBontebok, so that these two close allies have often been confounded\r\ntogether. But the present species is at once distinguishable by the\r\nabsence of the broad anal white disk above the tail, which ornaments\r\nthe Bontebok, and by the paler colour of the sides and flanks.\r\n\r\nWhether Burchell, whose scientific term “_albifrons_” has been\r\nuniversally adopted for the Blessbok, really intended to affix that\r\nname to the present species or to the Bontebok, is, to say the best of\r\nit, very doubtful. As we have already stated, both the vernacular names\r\n“Blessbok” and “Bontebok” were occasionally applied by the Boers to\r\n_Damaliscus pygargus_, and therefore, although Burchell expressly\r\ninvented his name “_albifrons_” for what he called the “Blessbok,”\r\nhe equally intended by that term to designate the long-known Bontebok,\r\nfrom which he did not distinguish the Blessbok. It so happened,\r\nhowever, that this was done in reference to a specimen of the latter,\r\nso that his name has been rightly retained for it. As we have pointed\r\nout in the previous article, these two near allies were first correctly\r\ndiscriminated by Harris, and it is therefore in any case wise to\r\nabide by his decision as to their proper names, both scientific and\r\nvernacular. Indeed Harris’s lead on this difficult question has been\r\ngenerally followed.\r\n\r\nIn Harris’s days, 1836–37, the Blessbok inhabited “the elevated tracts\r\nto the eastward of the Colony known as the Bontebok Flats,” and was\r\nfound on the great plains south of the Vaal River in “astounding\r\nherds.” Here it was that his first introduction to this splendid\r\nAntelope took place. Harris gives us a graphic account of how he lost\r\nhimself in the wilderness when engaged in the pursuit of these herds\r\nand barely escaped with his life.\r\n\r\n“The absence of fuel shortly obliged us to continue our march\r\nover a succession of salt-pans, upon which numerous great herds\r\nof Blessboks were busily licking the crystallized efflorescence.\r\nAlarmed at the approach of our cavalcade, vast troops of them were\r\ncontinually sweeping past against the wind, carrying their broad\r\nwhite noses close to the ground like a pack of harriers in full cry.\r\nHaving never obtained any specimens of this species, and our stock of\r\nprovisions, moreover, grievously requiring to be recruited, I mounted\r\n_Breslar_, my favourite Rosinante, and, little heeding whither I\r\nsped, dashed into the very thick of the Antelopes. The pine-apple hill\r\nbearing east about five miles, must, I concluded, prove a never-failing\r\nlandmark to direct my return to the road, which, however faint it\r\nhad become, could still readily be distinguished by a practised eye.\r\nDealing death around, I thus continued to scour the ensanguined plain,\r\nand to use my pleasure with the herd before me, which had in the\r\nmeantime increased from hundreds to thousands--reinforcements still\r\npouring in from all directions when, crying ‘hold, enough,’ I stayed\r\nmy hand from slaughter, and having divested some of the primest of\r\ntheir brilliant party-coloured robes, I packed the _spolia_ on my\r\nhorse, and, well satisfied with my performance, set out to rejoin the\r\nwaggons. But ah! vainly was it that I sought for them. Cantering to and\r\nfro between the string of frosted salt-pans and the little hill, which,\r\nfloating in the sea of mirage that environed it, seemed as though\r\npoised in the sky, again and again I strained my eyes for the road.\r\nThe monotony of the landscape baffled all attempts at recognition, and\r\nmy search proved utterly fruitless. Every feature of the scene was\r\nprecisely the same--the table mountains were completely obscured by the\r\nmidday haze--and in the constant recurrence of similar forms, I lost\r\nthe points of the compass, and at last became totally bewildered.”\r\n\r\nIn fact it took Harris on this occasion nearly three days and three\r\nnights wandering before he managed to rejoin his waggons.\r\n\r\nAt the present time these mighty herds have altogether vanished. So\r\nlate as 1861 Mr. E. L. Layard wrote that the Blessbok was “still found\r\nin considerable herds on the north-eastern border of Colony.” But in\r\n1889 Mr. Bryden (‘Kloof and Karroo’) tells us that this Antelope had\r\nbecome quite extinct within the limits of Capeland. Messrs. Nicolls and\r\nEglington, however, inform us that the Blessbok is still to be found on\r\nsome farms in the Transvaal, and in one or two spots in the Orange Free\r\nState. “Previous to Sir Charles Warren’s Expedition in 1884 they were\r\nfairly common on the open flats in Southern Bechuanaland, particularly\r\nin the neighbourhood of Groot Choiang, and also in the district of\r\nRhamathlabama, a few miles north of Mafeking. They are now practically\r\nextinct there, an occasional troop only straying into that district\r\nfrom the preserved farms in the Transvaal.”\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 11.\r\n\r\n  _Damaliscus albifrons._]\r\n\r\nOf the Blessbok, so far as I know, Lord Derby never procured for the\r\nKnowsley Menagerie but a single female, which was figured by Waterhouse\r\nHawkins on the same plate of the ‘Gleanings’ as the Bonteboks. At\r\nthe sale of the Knowsley Menagerie in August 1851, this animal was\r\npurchased by Mr. Westermann for the Zoological Society of Amsterdam.\r\nIn 1861 the Zoological Society of London received, as a present from\r\nSir George Grey, then Governor of the Cape Colony, a single female of\r\nthis Antelope along with other valuable animals. A male of the same\r\nspecies was obtained by purchase in 1862 and a female about two years\r\nlater. These animals throve and bred in the Society’s Gardens, and\r\nyoung ones were born in 1866, 1869, and 1870. But in the absence of\r\nfresh importations the whole stock was lost, and no Blessboks have\r\nbeen exhibited in the Society’s Gardens since 1880, when a single\r\nspecimen was received “on deposit.” In many of the continental gardens\r\nalso Blessboks were formerly to be seen, but of late years they have\r\nbecome extremely scarce; although we are informed that there are\r\nstill solitary examples living at Berlin, Antwerp, and Amsterdam, and\r\nMr. Reiche kindly tells us that he imported three females from the\r\nTransvaal this summer.\r\n\r\nIn the National Collection at the British Museum the Blessbok, we\r\nregret to say, is even more imperfectly represented than the Bontebok.\r\nBesides a mounted female specimen in bad condition there are only a\r\nfew frontlets of this species, so that additional specimens of this\r\nbeautiful Antelope, before it becomes quite extinct, would be specially\r\nacceptable.\r\n\r\nThe drawing of this Antelope (Plate IX.) and the woodcut now given (p.\r\n82) were both prepared under Sir Victor Brooke’s directions. The Plate\r\nwas engraved by Smit from one of Mr. Wolf’s sketches.\r\n\r\n    _January, 1895._\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    THE BOOK OF ANTELOPES. PL. X.\r\n\r\n    _Wolf del.

General colour dark\r\nchestnut-rufous; front of face, outer sides of shoulders, and hips\r\nblack. Chin and end of muzzle paler than cheeks. Belly purplish rufous,\r\nthe groins and back of horns only white. Limbs with the dark colour of\r\nshoulders and hips passing round them just above knees and hocks; below\r\nthese the legs are all reddish brown. Tail with its tuft reaching to\r\nthe hock, its base like the back, its crested terminal half black.\r\n\r\nFace-hairs reversed up to horns. No glandular suborbital brushes.\r\n\r\nSkull-measurements of an adult male:--basal length 14·9 inches,\r\ngreatest breadth 6·2, muzzle to orbit 10·8.\r\n\r\nHorns cylindrical, evenly curved, starting outwards and backwards,\r\ngradually turning inwards and backwards. There is also a slight\r\nlyration of the horns, so that both points and bases are directed a\r\nlittle upwards, the general lunate curve being thereby disturbed.\r\nGood male horns attain a length of 14 or 15 inches, with a basal\r\ncircumference of 7 or 8.\r\n\r\n   _Hab._ S.E. Africa, north of the Orange River up to the Zambesi,\r\n   and westward to the district of Lake Ngami.\r\n\r\nThe Sassaby is a fine large Antelope well known to the sportsmen of\r\nSouth-east Africa. Though it certainly belongs to this group, it is\r\nrather isolated by the peculiar form of the horns, which somewhat\r\nresemble those of the Tora. It nearest allies are no doubt the Blessbok\r\nand Bontebok, which, however, it considerably exceeds in stature, being\r\nnearly as big as a Hartebeest.\r\n\r\nThe first discovery of the Sassaby is due to the researches of the\r\ncelebrated African traveller, Dr. William J. Burchell. On the 10th of\r\nJuly, 1812, when on the Makkwárin River, in what is now the Orange Free\r\nState, Burchell’s hunters obtained a single specimen of an Antelope\r\nwhich was at once recognized as “new,” and was subsequently described\r\nin the second volume of the author’s ‘Travels’ (published in 1824), as\r\nthe “Crescent-horned Antelope, _Antilope lunata_” Burchell states\r\nthat it seemed to be an extremely scarce animal, as he never met with\r\nit again during the whole of his journeyings, the fact being that he\r\nhad only just entered within the southern boundary of the range of this\r\nspecies. Burchell’s typical specimen, or rather portions of it, viz.\r\nthe frontlet and horns, is still in the National Collection, to which\r\nhe presented it.\r\n\r\nBetween the period of the discovery of the Sassaby by Burchell and the\r\npublication of its description this Antelope attracted the attention\r\nof another observer, Samuel Daniell, an artist who accompanied Dr.\r\nSomerville on two expeditions into the interior of the Cape Colony\r\nearly in the present century. One of the copperplates engraved by\r\nWilliam Daniell from the drawings made by his deceased brother Samuel,\r\nand published in 1820, gives a good representation of this species,\r\nwhich is stated in the accompanying letterpress to be “an Antelope,\r\nheretofore not described, found in the Booshwana country.” But no\r\nfurther particulars are given of it.\r\n\r\nHamilton-Smith, in his volume on the Ruminants, published in Griffith’s\r\nTranslation of Cuvier’s ‘Règne Animal,’ correctly brought together\r\nDaniell’s “Sassaby” and Burchell’s _Antilope lunata_ under one\r\nhead and added a copy of Daniell’s figure.\r\n\r\nExcept in the quotations of its names by various systematists we\r\nfind little more recorded of the Sassaby until 1840, when Capt. W.\r\nCornwallis Harris gave an excellent account of it in his beautiful work\r\non the ‘Game and Wild Animals of Southern Africa.’ This experienced\r\nsportsman and artist devoted one of his life-like plates to the\r\nrepresentation of this Antelope, with which he had made himself well\r\nacquainted. “The Sassaybe,” he tells us, “like its congener, the\r\nHartebeest, delights in the neighbourhood of hills, frequenting the\r\nopen country with island-looking mimosa-groves, as well as the patches\r\nof scraggy forest that skirt the foot of many of the superior mountain\r\nranges, which, however, neither species ever ascends. Among the parks\r\nof mokaala trees about the Cashan and Kurichane mountains we constantly\r\nsaw them.” The painted skins of the Sassaby were in those days, Harris\r\ntells us, “in great request amongst the savages for kobos or leathern\r\nmantles, as well on account of their brilliant colours as from their\r\nextreme suppleness.” In this article of dress, Harris tells us, “the\r\nshining black tail, opened and squeezed flat, was usually fastened\r\non so as to depend like a queue from the back of the neck, and the\r\nuniversal admiration in which this elegant appendage was held rendered\r\nits wearer the subject of many a quarrel.”\r\n\r\nVery shortly after the publication of Harris’s ‘Portraits,’ Dr.\r\nAndrew Smith published his scientific account of the Sassaby in one\r\nof the numbers of his ‘Illustrations of the Zoology of South Africa.’\r\nAfter an accurate description Dr. Smith well remarks that “between\r\nthe appearances of the horns of the Sassaby and the Caama there are\r\nsuch marked differences, that we must at once conclude that no valid\r\nimportance ought to be attached either to the form or direction of\r\nhorns in the grouping of species. The subocular glands also differ\r\nmaterially in these two animals: in the Caama they are covered with\r\nshort hair, similar to that of the other parts of the face; in the\r\nSassaby they are without covering. In the Caama, the last portion of\r\nthe tail is completely encircled with hair; in the Sassaby the sides\r\nand upper surface only are so furnished, the under surface being bare.\r\nIn general appearance the two animals present a strong resemblance to\r\neach other.” Dr. Smith adds the following note on the habits of this\r\nspecies:--\r\n\r\n“While _B. caama_ seems to prefer the open grassy plains for\r\nits feeding-places, the Sassaby apparently delights to resort to\r\nsituations in the vicinity of wood, or to such as are actually\r\nwooded, and in districts of the latter description large herds are\r\noften observed feeding among the dense brushwood without apparent\r\nconcern. All the individuals we saw near to Latakoo were vigilant\r\nin watching our motions, and apparently little disposed to trust\r\nthemselves within our reach; while those, again, on the other side of\r\nKurrichane were comparatively tame, and though they did not actually\r\nresist our approach, yet they often continued in the situations in\r\nwhich we discovered them, until they were quite within the range of\r\nour guns; and even after being fired at they only retreated slowly,\r\nand rarely without frequently turning round as they retired to watch\r\nour movements. Their retreat, after each examination of the kind\r\nmentioned, was commonly preceded by some significant springs or\r\nstrange gesticulations, such as are often made by common domestic\r\ncattle when they are put to flight by any object which excites their\r\nalarm. In point of manners, both the Sassaby and the Hartebeest show a\r\nconsiderable resemblance to the bovine tribe, and, except the Gnu, more\r\nso than any of the other Antelopes.”\r\n\r\nComing to more modern times, Mr. T. E. Buckley, in his excellent\r\narticle on the “Geographical Distribution of South-African Mammals,”\r\nread before the Zoological Society of London in 1876, gives us the\r\nsubjoined notes of his experience of this species:--“Although, in\r\nHarris’s time, the Sassaybe appears to have been common on the plains,\r\nat the present day it is essentially a bush-loving animal. According\r\nto Dr. A. Smith the Sassabye was rarely known to advance to the south\r\nof Latakoo; at present its southern limit appears to be the Amaswazi\r\ncountry; along the Limpopo it is very common, and continues so into\r\nthe Matabili country up to the Zambesi. The old males do not seem to\r\nassociate with the females; nor do they appear so common, as out of\r\nnearly a dozen obtained by us only two were males, and one of these was\r\nimmature. We observed very young calves in October. The Sassabye runs\r\nwith a peculiar gait, reminding one of a rocking-horse; its shoulders\r\nare very high, sloping away to the rump; it does not seem to be a very\r\nshy animal.”\r\n\r\nFive years later the experienced African hunter and naturalist, Mr.\r\nF. C. Selous, in the same Journal, gives us the following notes on\r\nthis Antelope:--“In travelling up the centre of South Africa, the\r\nfirst place in which the Sassaby is to be met with now-a-days is in\r\nthe neighbourhood of the Marico River, a tributary of the Limpopo; and\r\nfrom there it is found throughout Central South Africa wherever I have\r\nbeen, south of the Zambesi, in all those parts of the country that are\r\nsuitable to its habits. I say south of the Zambesi, because during\r\nmy journey through the Manica country to the north of that river in\r\n1877–78, although the terrain appeared well suited to its habits and\r\nrequirements, I saw none of these Antelopes. I have heard, however,\r\nfrom the natives that they are very common in the neighbourhood of\r\nSesheke.\r\n\r\n“This Antelope is never found in hilly country or in thick jungle, but\r\nfrequents the open downs that are quite free from bush, or else open\r\nforest-country in which treeless glades are to be met with. On the\r\nMababe Flat at the end of the dry season large herds of these animals\r\ncongregate together, and I have often seen, I am sure, several hundreds\r\nof them at once. They are, without exception, the fleetest and most\r\nenduring Antelope in South Africa. In 1879 all the Tsessebe and Blue\r\nWildebeest cows calved on the northern bank of the Chobe during the\r\nfirst week in September, whilst on the Mababe Flat, only about one\r\ndegree further south, the same animals did not calve before the first\r\nweek in November.”\r\n\r\nMr. Bertram L. Sclater, R.E., who was at Beira for a week in April\r\n1892, on his way home from Nyasaland, informs us that he was told in\r\nthat town that the Sassaby is one of the commonest Antelopes on the\r\nbanks of the Lower Pungwe, and that he was shown several frontlets of\r\nthis species said to have been obtained between Beira and Chimoio. So\r\nfar as we know, this is the furthest northern locality recorded for\r\nthis species, which, as shown by Mr. Selous, does not appear to be\r\nfound anywhere north of the Zambesi.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 12.\r\n\r\n  Head of supposed hybrid between _Damaliscus lunatus_ and\r\n  _Bubalis caama_.\r\n\r\n  (P. Z. S. 1893, p. 2.)]\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the Zoological Society of London in January 1893\r\nMr. Selous made another interesting communication on this Antelope,\r\nexhibiting a skull which he believed to be that of a hybrid between\r\nit and the Hartebeest. This curious animal was shot in 1890 on the\r\nTati River, Matabeleland, by Cornelius van Rooyen, a well-known Boer\r\nhunter. While this skull, which is now in the British Museum, closely\r\nresembles that of the Hartebeest, its horns partake of the characters\r\nof both the supposed parents. They stand nearly straight up from the\r\nskull as in the Hartebeest, but are slightly lunate in form and ringed\r\nas in the Sassaby. Mr. Selous was informed that the general colour\r\nof its skin was precisely that of the Sassaby, but that it carried\r\nthe comparatively large bushy tail of the Hartebeest. As hybrids\r\namongst the larger mammals are excessively rare in a wild state,\r\nthis occurrence is well worthy of record, and we have to thank the\r\nZoological Society for kindly permitting us to use their woodcut to\r\nillustrate it.\r\n\r\nBesides the typical frontlet of this species in the British Museum,\r\nalready mentioned, there are a mounted pair in the Gallery obtained by\r\nDr. Andrew Smith, and skeletons of both sexes made from specimens shot\r\non the Manyame River, Mashonaland, by Mr. Selous.\r\n\r\nThe Sassaby is rarely seen in captivity. So far as we know, the only\r\nspecimens ever brought alive to Europe are two females imported by Mr.\r\nC. Reiche, of Alfeld, from the Transvaal in 1888. One of these was sold\r\nto the Amsterdam Gardens (where Sclater inspected it in April 1889),\r\nand the other to the Antwerp Gardens.\r\n\r\nOur figure of this species (Plate X.) was put on the stone by Mr. Smit\r\nfrom a sketch made for Sir Victor Brooke by Mr. Wolf.\r\n\r\n    _January, 1895._\r\n\r\n\r\n                        GENUS III.

That of an old male measures\r\nas follows:--basal length 18·1 inches, greatest breadth 7·7, muzzle to\r\norbit 13·3.\r\n\r\nHorns placed so that the hinder edge of their palm is little more than\r\nlevel with the back of the skull; the palm itself comparatively low,\r\nsmooth, small in comparison with the enormous palm of _C. gnu_.\r\nBeyond the palm the basal two-thirds of the horn points directly\r\noutwards, while the ends are curved upwards, forwards, and inwards. A\r\nfine pair of horns will measure 26 or 28 inches between the outer sides\r\nof the curves of the two horns.\r\n\r\n   _Hab._ Eastern Africa, from the Vaal River northwards through\r\n   Zambesia, Nyasaland, and German East Africa to the north of\r\n   Kilimanjaro.\r\n\r\nThe Brindled Gnu, although, as it seems, previously observed by\r\nLichtenstein in Bechuanaland, was first actually obtained by the\r\ncelebrated African traveller Burchell, who went far into the interior\r\nof the country in 1811 and 1812. In June of the latter year, when\r\nencamped at the great Khosi Fountain in Bechuanaland, as he tells us\r\nin the second volume of his ‘Travels,’ an example of a “new species of\r\nAntelope” was brought in by his hunters. Being well acquainted with the\r\nWhite-tailed Gnu of the Cape Colony, Burchell at once recognized it as\r\na second species of that genus. Burchell pointed out its differences\r\nfrom its southern representative very clearly, and added a scientific\r\nLatin diagnosis in a footnote. He called it _Antilope taurina_, because\r\nits horns resembled those of an Ox more than those of any other\r\nAntelope. The half-bred Hottentots, he observes, give it the name of\r\nthe _Bastaard Wildebeest_, while the Bechuanas call it _Kokūn_\r\nor _Kokūng_. Altogether Burchell obtained five specimens of this\r\nAntelope, one of which (a female), shot in the following October near\r\nthe Maadji Mountains, was, as we learn from his “List of Quadrupeds,”\r\npresented to the British Museum in 1817, and seems to have formed the\r\nbasis of his technical description.\r\n\r\nTwo years previous to the actual publication of Burchell’s description,\r\nhowever, the Brindled Gnu had been figured in Daniell’s ‘Sketches of\r\nAfrican Scenery’ under the name of the “Kokoon.”\r\n\r\nIn 1827 Major Charles Hamilton-Smith, F.R.S., in Griffith’s edition\r\nof Cuvier’s ‘Animal Kingdom,’ besides recognizing _C. gnu_ and\r\n_C. taurina_, added a presumed third species of the genus, which\r\nhe based on a specimen then exhibited in the “Museum of the Missionary\r\nSociety of London.” It is quite clear, however, from the description\r\nand figure that Hamilton-Smith’s _C. gorgon_ is identical with\r\nBurchell’s previously described _Antilope taurina_, and that the\r\nlatter term should take precedence, although many naturalists have\r\npreferred to use Hamilton-Smith’s name for this species.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 13.\r\n\r\n  Adult Brindled Gnu.\r\n\r\n  (Roy. Nat. Hist. vol. ii. p. 314.)]\r\n\r\nIn 1836 and 1837 the celebrated artist and sportsman, Cornwallis\r\nHarris, met with the Brindled Gnu on the plains of what is now the\r\nOrange Free State in “countless numbers.” “Instantly after crossing\r\nthe Orange River,” he tells us, “the Kokoon or Brindled Gnu usurps the\r\nplace of the White-tailed species, and, although herds of the former\r\nmay actually be seen grazing on the northern bank, not a single\r\nindividual has ever been known to pass the barrier.... By the Dutch\r\nBoers the present species is termed the Bastaard or Blauw Wilde Beest:\r\nthroughout the country of the Bechuanas, as far as the Tropic, it is\r\nrecognized as the Kokoon, and the Hottentot tribes designate it the\r\nKaop or Baas, both of which terms, signifying _master_, refer, in\r\nall probability, to its bold and terrific bearing. When excited by the\r\nappearance of any suspicious object, or aroused by any unusual noise,\r\nthe Kokoon is wont to appear much more grim and ferocious than it\r\nactually proves--not unfrequently approaching with an air of defiance,\r\nas if resolved to do battle with the hunter, but decamping on the first\r\nexhibition of hostility on his part. On being pursued, the herd bring\r\ntheir aquiline noses low between their knees, and flourishing their\r\nstreaming black tails, tear away in long regular files at a furious\r\ngallop, wheeling curiously about at a distance of two or three hundred\r\nyards, advancing boldly towards the danger, tossing their shaggy heads\r\nin a threatening manner--presently making a sudden stop, presenting an\r\nimpenetrable front of horns, and staring wildly at the object of their\r\nmistrust.... When engaged in grazing they have an extremely dull and\r\nclumsy appearance, and at a little distance might often be mistaken for\r\nwild buffaloes; but their manner is sportive--at one moment standing\r\nto gaze at nothing, and at the next scampering over the plain without\r\nany apparent object in view, making grotesque curvets and plunges, with\r\ntheir preposterous Bonassus-looking heads held down between the fore\r\nlegs.”\r\n\r\nIn his valuable ‘Illustrations of South-African Zoology,’ Sir Andrew\r\nSmith gives an excellent account of this species (published in August\r\n1842), accompanied by an indifferent figure of the female and young.\r\nSir Andrew justly observes that this and the Common Gnu are two of the\r\nmost interesting and extraordinary quadrupeds which occur in South\r\nAfrica. “When either the one or other of those animals, especially\r\nunder excitement, stands in front of an observer, with the head and\r\nanterior parts of the body only distinctly visible, the idea of its\r\nstrong resemblance to a small ox immediately arises. When, again, its\r\nbody and posterior parts are the portions most conspicuously in view,\r\nthe likeness to a horse is remarkable; but when its limbs only are\r\ntaken in review, it presents a strong similarity to the more typical\r\nAntelopes.”\r\n\r\nAt the time when these observations were made both the Gnus, according\r\nto Sir Andrew Smith, inhabited, in enormous multitudes, the grassy\r\nplains to the northward of the Vaal River, and after the fall of the\r\nsummer rains were in the habit of advancing simultaneously in large\r\nherds as far as the southern branches of the Orange River. But on\r\nreaching the latter stream singularly enough the Brindled Gnu ceased\r\nto advance, and the Common Gnu alone passed into the Cape Colony. The\r\nappearance of the latter to the south of the Orange River was the\r\nsignal for hunters of all denominations to prepare for the chase,\r\nand though the yearly slaughter was very great the herds in those\r\ndays never ceased to renew their periodical visitations. Strongly\r\nexpressed as are the views of both Andrew Smith and Harris as to the\r\nline of demarcation between the two species of Gnu, there seems to be\r\nsome doubt as to their correctness. An excellent recent authority,\r\nMr. H. A. Bryden (‘Kloof and Karroo’), tells us that the Brindled\r\nGnu was in former days certainly a “denizen, albeit a rare one, south\r\nof the Orange River,” and gives us Gordon-Cumming as an authority.\r\nGordon-Cumming asserts (‘Hunter’s Life in South Africa,’ p. 148) that\r\nhe met with the Brindled Gnu in the Karroo country west of Colesberg,\r\nin what is now the Hopetown division of the Cape Colony. But Mr. Bryden\r\nadmits that it has now for many years been extinct in that district. In\r\nthe Transvaal, also, he tells us, the Boers have, of late years, played\r\nsad havoc with this singular Antelope, not long ago found in countless\r\nthousands on the plains of that Republic.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Nicolls and Eglington, in their ‘Sportsman in South Africa,’\r\ntell us the same story. Writing in 1892, they state that, except in\r\nsome of the northern districts along the Crocodile River, the Brindled\r\nGnu is now extremely scarce in the Transvaal, and practically extinct\r\nin the Orange Free State. But it is still met with in Bechuanaland,\r\nand is fairly plentiful along the edges of the Great Kalahari Desert.\r\n“In the Lake Ngami district, on both banks of the Botletle River, and\r\nfrom thence right up to the Chobe and Zambesi, it is quite common in\r\nsuitable localities, and, at the present time, large troops may be seen\r\non the Ma-Chara-Chara and Mababe Flats, and in the country surrounding\r\nthe great salt-pans of Makari-Kari, through which the main road passes\r\nto the Victoria Falls.”\r\n\r\nSo much for the occurrence of this species in the South and South-west\r\nof Africa, past and present. But we must now trace its distribution\r\nto the north; for it is an extraordinary fact that the Brindled Gnu,\r\ninstead of being confined, like its sister species, to a small part\r\nof South Africa, extends up along the eastern coast certainly as far\r\nas Kilimanjaro, and perhaps even into Sennaar, where reports of the\r\noccurrence of a Gnu-like Antelope were made to Heuglin. It is, however,\r\npossible that some of these northern Gnus may belong to the White-maned\r\nspecies, which we shall presently mention.\r\n\r\nBeginning from the Limpopo, Mr. Selous tells us that the Brindled\r\nGnu is found all over this portion of South-eastern Africa up to the\r\nZambesi, in districts suitable to its habits--that is, “in open downs\r\ndevoid of bush and in open glades in the forest,” but not in hilly\r\ncountries. Peters and Sir John Kirk both enroll it among the mammals of\r\nZambesia, the latter author stating that at the time of his visit it\r\nwas “very abundant in considerable herds in the Batoka country, also\r\nnear Lake Shirwa, and at Shupanga on the Zambesi.” As to its present\r\nexistence in the Shiré Highlands, Mr. B. L. Sclater, R.E., sends us\r\nthe following notes.--“In November 1891, while travelling between Zomba\r\nand Milanji, I was shooting in the marshes on the west bank of the\r\nTochila. I saw a Gnu and tried to stalk it, but it was right in the\r\nopen and I could not get near it. My head man, a Swahili, said it was\r\na Gnu (_Nyumbo_), and he was well acquainted with that animal.\r\nAgain, in 1892, at Midima, to the south of the Tochila, I obtained\r\na tail of a Gnu from a native, who told me that formerly there was\r\na large herd of them on these plains, but that he thought they were\r\nnow all killed. I believe that Mr. Sharpe has met with the Gnu on the\r\nplains to the west of the Upper Shiré, between Matope and the sources\r\nof the Lesungwi River.”\r\n\r\nAs regards the more northern portion of the British Central African\r\nProtectorate, Mr. Crawshay tells us that the Gnu is apparently unknown\r\nto the natives round the northern half of Lake Nyasa, and is not met\r\nwith anywhere in the immediate neighbourhood of the Lake, though found\r\na little to the south-east, and also, he believes, to the south-west.\r\n\r\nIn 1864 Speke met with the Brindled Gnu in large herds in Khutu, on\r\nthe western borders of Uzaramo, close to the Kingani River, where it\r\ninhabits the “park-like lands adjoining the stream.”\r\n\r\nLater on Sir John Kirk obtained heads of it in the same district, and\r\nhas favoured us with the following notes on its occurrence in this part\r\nof German East Africa:--\r\n\r\n“As regards the Brindled Gnu in East Africa, I may say that, although\r\nfamiliar with this animal on the Upper Zambezi near the Victoria\r\nFalls, where they were common in 1860, I have only since shot them in\r\nUkami, to the west of Dar-es-salam, and on the River Wami inland from\r\nBagomoyo. In the plains and on the rolling ground between the River\r\nRufiji and the River Wami they used to be common. I have shot them\r\nwithin ten miles of the coast, and I believe that they extend back to\r\nthe foot of the mountains.\r\n\r\n“As I was not then acquainted with the species or variety lately found\r\nby Jackson, I cannot from memory express any opinion as to the identity\r\nof these animals, further than that they seemed to me identical with\r\nthe Brindled Gnus I had killed years previously near the Victoria Falls\r\nand Sesheke on the Upper Zambezi.\r\n\r\n“In East Africa, near the coast, in the places above-named\r\nwhere I found this Antelope, it never occurs in numbers, but is\r\noften associated as an attendant on other game, especially upon\r\nLichtenstein’s Hartebeest. It often causes annoyance to the sportsman\r\nby giving warning of his approach to the other Antelopes.\r\n\r\n“I believe this Gnu suffered from the recent cattle-disease which\r\nduring the last four years has decimated the Buffalo, the Giraffe,\r\nthe Eland, and many other kinds of game, not affecting, however, the\r\nRhinoceros, and certain other animals. This disease seems to have\r\nkilled off different classes of animals in different localities,\r\nattacking universally, wherever it appeared, the cattle of the natives.\r\n\r\n“Thousands of hides of cattle that have died of this plague have been\r\nfreely imported into Europe and America; the disease has travelled from\r\nSomali-land to Nyasa-land, and yet we do not know its nature. Some say\r\nit is anthrax, others that it is pleuro-pneumonia; but whether it is\r\na disease that can be communicated by the dried hides of the diseased\r\nanimals has not been ascertained. In Somali-land and Masai-land it has\r\nworked itself out, and it may stop short of the Cape Colony and not\r\ncross the Zambezi; but in the meantime it has decimated the African\r\nGame, and left its mark by changing the whole life of the pastoral\r\npeoples who depended on their cattle alone.”\r\n\r\nIn British East Africa the Brindled Gnu (here called by the Swahilis\r\n“_Nyumbo_”) is well-known to the sportsmen who have visited the\r\nhappy hunting-grounds of Kilimanjaro. Sir John Willoughby and his\r\nfriends found it principally to the north-east of the mountain “in\r\nlarge herds.” Mr. F. J. Jackson (‘Big Game Shooting’) tells us it is\r\nmore plentiful in the Useri district to the north-east of Kilimanjaro,\r\nand on the Athi plains to the north and west of Machakós, than anywhere\r\nelse. In the latter place, on August 5, 1890, he and his companions\r\n“saw an enormous herd of 1500”; but this was “quite unusual, as they\r\nare rarely found in herds of more than from twenty to sixty.” But it\r\nis possible that some of Mr. Jackson’s observations may refer to the\r\nfollowing species, as when he wrote them he did not distinguish the two\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nMr. Jackson gives the following advice to the Gnu-hunter:--“Wildebeests\r\nare amongst the most difficult beasts to stalk, owing to the open\r\nnature of the country in which they are found, and will probably try\r\nthe sportsman’s patience more than any other Antelope. They will stand\r\ngazing at him, and will sometimes allow him to get within a range\r\nof 200 yards, if he pretends to walk past them, though in reality\r\nclosing in upon them in a semicircle; but directly he stops to take\r\na shot they will shake their heads in the most defiant way, and with\r\na few snorts and flicks of their mule-like tails, kick up their heels\r\nand caper off jauntily. As they will, as a rule, pull up a short way\r\noff, the sportsman will have the annoyance of again adopting the same\r\ntactics, with probably like results, until he might almost believe that\r\nthe Wildebeest is enjoying itself at his expense. He should, however,\r\navoid risking a long shot (the Wildebeest is an extremely tough\r\nbrute, and will go for miles when wounded in such a way as would soon\r\nbring other game to a standstill), since after two or three fruitless\r\nattempts if no shot is fired its suspicions will become allayed, and it\r\nwill probably stand sufficiently long to give him a good chance.”\r\n\r\nThe Brindled Gnu is not so commonly met with in Zoological Gardens as\r\nthe White-tailed species. It is generally considered to be a rarer\r\nanimal in the market, and the dealers ask a larger price for it. We are\r\ninformed that a pair of Brindled Gnus bred in the Zoological Gardens\r\nat Breslau in 1886 or 1887. The only specimen ever received by the\r\nZoological Society, so far as we can make out, was a female purchased\r\nin 1859. In the continental Gardens it has been better represented,\r\nand the collections at Antwerp, Amsterdam, and Berlin usually contain\r\nspecimens of this Antelope. These have been, in many cases, obtained\r\nfrom Mr. Reiche, of Alfeld, who has received several examples of this\r\nGnu among his recent importations of living animals from the Transvaal.\r\n\r\nIn the British Museum the Brindled Gnu is represented by one of\r\nBurchell’s typical examples, as already mentioned, and by an adult male\r\nreceived from Sir Andrew Smith. Both these are mounted specimens. There\r\nare likewise a skeleton, obtained by Mr. Selous in Mashonaland in 1885,\r\nand a set of skulls and horns in the same collection.\r\n\r\nOur Plate of this animal was put on the stone by Mr. Smit from a sketch\r\nmade by Mr. Wolf. For the use of the woodcut (fig. 13, p. 98), drawn by\r\nthe celebrated German artist Mützel, we are indebted to the kindness of\r\nMessrs. Warne and Co., by whom it has been used in their ‘Royal Natural\r\nHistory’ (vol. ii. p. 314).\r\n\r\n    _January, 1895._\r\n\r\n\r\n                      17.

A few whitish hairs are also intermixed with the black of the\r\ndorsal mane.\r\n\r\nThe skull is shorter and broader than in _C. taurinus_, especially\r\nin the region of the muzzle, and the horns are placed further back on\r\nthe head, so that the palm surpasses the back of the skull posteriorly\r\nby nearly half its breadth. The palm is also more tipped up behind away\r\nfrom the skull, and is much knobbier, on which account the hinder edge\r\nof the horns forms a more serpentine curve.\r\n\r\nThe dimensions of the typical skull are as follows:--basal length 16\r\ninches, greatest breadth 7·6, muzzle to eye 12·1.\r\n\r\n   _Hab._ East Africa, Athi plains, Ukambani, north of Kilimanjaro,\r\n   and west side of Victoria Nyanza.\r\n\r\nAs we have already stated, this form, although otherwise agreeing in\r\nnearly every point with the Brindled Gnu, is readily distinguishable\r\nby its white mane, white jaw-tufts, and the generally paler colour.\r\nBut whether we ought to classify it as a separate species, or as a\r\nsubspecies, or only as a variety of the Brindled Gnu future researches\r\nonly can decide. We know as yet too little of its exact range and\r\nmode of occurrence to be able to settle this question, nor is there\r\na sufficient series of specimens available. If it should be found\r\nhereafter that beyond a certain boundary in Eastern Africa all the\r\nGnus met with are of the White-bearded form, and that along this line\r\nof junction there are transitional forms between this and the ordinary\r\nBrindled Gnu, we should do well to allow it merely subspecific rank.\r\nIf, on the other hand, it shall be found that the White-bearded\r\nGnu occurs side by side with the Brindled Gnu without mixing or\r\ninterbreeding with that animal, we shall have to count it as a full\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 14.\r\n\r\n  Skull of _Connochætes albojubatus_, ♂.]\r\n\r\nThomas, in 1892, based his _Connochætes taurinus albojubatus_ on a\r\nhead in Mr. F. J. Jackson’s collection, at that time under the care of\r\nMessrs. Rowland Ward and Co., but since kindly presented by Mr. Jackson\r\nto the National Collection. Thomas, from erroneous information, gave\r\nthe locality as “Uganda,” but we have since ascertained that this and\r\nanother specimen, still in Mr. Jackson’s possession, were obtained on\r\nthe Athi plains north of Kilimanjaro. Mr. Gedge assures us that no Gnus\r\nat all were met with by Mr. Jackson and himself in Uganda.\r\n\r\nMr. Gedge has kindly supplied the following notes on his experiences\r\nwith the Gnus of British East Africa:--\r\n\r\n“Both the Blue Wildebeeste and Jackson’s Wildebeeste are found in\r\nBritish East Africa, and are to be met with in great numbers on the\r\nAthi plains north of Ukambani. Of the two, the blue variety is,\r\nperhaps, more usually met with, though I would remark that on my\r\nupward journey to Uganda, in December 1892, I only encountered a few\r\nsolitary specimens of the Blue form in a part where they are generally\r\nseen in hundreds, whereas on my downward journey, in the month of\r\nAugust of the following year, the same locality was entirely tenanted\r\nby Jackson’s Wildebeeste, which on this occasion were so tame that I\r\nwas able to literally walk right in amongst them and knock them down\r\nwith a small Winchester. This was really the one and only occasion\r\nthat I have met with this latter variety in any great numbers. On the\r\nother hand, the Blue Wildebeeste will be found more or less commonly\r\ndistributed over the Leikipia and Mau plateaux. It probably ranges\r\nover a very wide extent of country to the northwards, though I cannot\r\nremember having seen any Wildebeestes at all north of Lake Baringo.\r\nAt the same time its non-appearance on the occasion of my visit may\r\ndoubtless very easily be accounted for by the excessive dryness of the\r\ncountry at that time, and the consequent lack of pasturage. Similarly,\r\nI have never seen Gnus anywhere near the Victoria Lake, though\r\npossibly other travellers may have done so. The Gnu is an uncouth and\r\nungainly beast in appearance, and, as a rule, will not allow itself\r\nto be easily approached. As the open character of the country which\r\nit usually frequents more or less precludes any idea of being able\r\nto stalk it successfully, the method which I adopted, and which I\r\nfound answered best, was to walk along quietly parallel to the herd,\r\ngradually edging inwards. On such occasions their natural curiosity\r\nwould often allow a shot to be obtained at a distance of from a hundred\r\nand fifty to two hundred yards. Being tough and hard to kill, Gnus must\r\nbe struck accurately by a weapon with a high degree of penetration.\r\nAs an illustration of their great vitality, I would mention that on\r\none occasion I had the misfortune to break both the fore legs of\r\none just above the fetlock, and that in spite of these crippling\r\nwounds the poor beast was able to cover a distance of nearly half a\r\nmile on its stumps before I came sufficiently near to administer the\r\n_coup-de-grâce_. This was in spite of the fact that, in addition\r\nto this severe injury, it had received two other solid express bullets\r\nin its body, one of which was afterwards discovered to have penetrated\r\nthe base of the heart. When alarmed the Gnu usually runs but a short\r\ndistance at a time, at a stiff ungainly gallop, whisking its tail round\r\nin the most comical fashion. It then stops and turns to inspect the\r\nobject of its alarm, at the same time uttering a few snorts. Having\r\nsatisfied itself of the approaching danger, it will again gallop off\r\nand pursue the same tactics several times if unmolested. It is a very\r\nharmless and inoffensive animal in spite of its ferocious aspect.”\r\n\r\nAs regards the Gnus of German East Africa there is the same difficulty.\r\nHerr Matschie has kindly sent to Sclater the following notes on this\r\nsubject:--\r\n\r\n“At Berlin we have received from Oscar Neumann several skins and\r\nskulls, young and old, of the Gnu [procured during his recent journey\r\nnorthwards from Irangi up the east side of Lake Victoria].\r\n\r\n“All of these have white neck-manes and chin-bunches and brownish heads\r\nand manes, but in some cases the latter are mixed with white, and the\r\ntails are of a similar colour. The body is dirty greyish brown, without\r\na trace of bluish. One old bull shows vertical stripes on the front of\r\nthe body, the hairs having been worn short.\r\n\r\n“The localities are--between Ngera and Irangi; Mount Guerui; Mgogo,\r\nnorth of the Manyara Lake; and further on as far as Ngare Dobasch,\r\nwhere they cease.\r\n\r\n“Neumann writes that on Mount Guerui and farther along he observed the\r\ntwo varieties living apart. On the Guerui he saw at the same time a\r\nherd of light-coloured Gnus, and a herd varying from bluish black to\r\nblack, but no transitional forms.”\r\n\r\nFrom Mgogo, Neumann writes:--“By the six skins which I obtained [these\r\nskins have not yet arrived in Berlin] I hope to prove that there are\r\ntwo species, or, at any rate, varieties of Gnus--one lilac-black grey,\r\nand the other bright yellowish brown. On the Mangoto natron-swamp they\r\nkept apart. Here in Mgogo the black form predominates, so that it seems\r\nto be the more northern. Of two young examples of about the same age,\r\njudging from their horns, one has a black forehead, and the other has\r\ntwo white spots in front of the eyes.\r\n\r\n“Von Höhnel and Count Teleki found only grey-black Gnus on Mount Maeru,\r\nbut these had the neck-manes striped with white and black. On the\r\nNaschiri Lake, Teleki first met with a pure white-maned specimen.”\r\n\r\nThe woodcut of the skull of this Antelope (fig. 14, p. 106) is taken\r\nfrom one of Mr. Jackson’s specimens in the British Museum.\r\n\r\n    _January, 1895._\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    THE BOOK OF ANTELOPES, PL.

General colour dark brown\r\nor blackish, the upwardly-directed facial tuft, the long hairs of the\r\nnape, throat, and chest black. Tail very long; its thick tuft reaching\r\nnearly to the ground; its colour white, except just at the base, where\r\nit is like the back.\r\n\r\nSkull shorter than in _C. taurinus_, but lengthened above, owing\r\nto the horn-bases being prolonged backwards to support the enormous\r\npalms of the horns, beyond the level of the occiput. Nasals short and\r\nbroad.\r\n\r\nMeasurements:--basal length 15·5 inches, greatest breadth 6·4, muzzle\r\nto orbit 9·3.\r\n\r\nHorns with very large longitudinally developed palms, frequently\r\nattaining 8 inches in their greatest diameter. Proximal half of horn\r\ndirected downwards, outwards, and forwards, then rapidly recurved,\r\nthe end, which is about 10 or 12 inches in length, pointing nearly\r\nvertically upwards. Measured from the top of the palm outside the\r\ncurves to the tip, good horns attain from 24 to 26 inches.\r\n\r\n   _Hab._ South Africa, south of the Limpopo.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary form of the Gnu quickly attracted the notice\r\nof the early Dutch settlers at the Cape. They called it the\r\n“_Wilde-Beest_” supposing it to be a wild form of the domestic\r\ncattle, whilst the native name was stated to be _Gnou_ or\r\n_Gnu_. As early as 1776 a living specimen of the Gnu appears\r\nto have reached Amsterdam, and was described by Allamand[8], whose\r\naccount of it was copied by Buffon in the Supplement to his ‘Histoire\r\nNaturelle,’ and by Vosmaer[9]. In 1777 Zimmermann latinized the native\r\nname, and used it specifically as _gnou_. This term was softened\r\nby Gmelin into _gnu_, and thus modified has been generally adopted\r\nas the specific name of this Antelope.\r\n\r\nThe older authors described the Gnu as lively, active, and petulant,\r\ntrotting, ambling, and galloping with great swiftness; the males\r\nbellowing somewhat like a bull, the young ones having a “nasal murmur.”\r\n“They are sportive, and when alarmed always commence by playing with\r\neach other, striking sideways with their horns; but this lasts only for\r\na moment, and the whole troop soon flies away across the desert with\r\namazing speed.” By the year 1820 the Gnu appears to have been driven\r\nfar from the neighbourhood of Cape Town, and even at that period not to\r\nhave been found nearer than the Karroo district.\r\n\r\nSir Andrew Smith, whose expedition into the interior took place in\r\n1834, 1835, and 1836, gives the grassy plains north of the Vaal River\r\nas the ordinary habitation of the Gnu at that epoch. After the fall\r\nof the summer rains the present species, he tells us, leaving its\r\ncongener, the Brindled Gnu, behind, passes the Orange River into the\r\nCape Colony. Here it becomes the prey of the hunters of all sorts who\r\nat this season turn out every year to track and slaughter the advancing\r\nherds.\r\n\r\nCornwallis Harris, who visited the Cape Colony shortly afterwards,\r\ntells us nearly the same story. He likewise found the Gnu, to the\r\nillustration of which he devotes the first plate of his great artistic\r\nwork on the ‘Game-Animals of South Africa,’ abundant in the open\r\nplains of the Vaal River, and still to be met with even in some parts\r\nof the Colony. The hunt of the Wildebeest, Harris tells us, “forms a\r\nfavourite diversion of the Dutch colonists, and occupies a very large\r\nportion of the apparently valueless time of the _trek-boors_, or nomad\r\nfarmers, who graze their overgrown flocks and herds on the verdant\r\nmeadows lying beyond the borders of the sterile colony. The carcase\r\nof a full-grown Wildebeest, even when ‘broken,’ forms a fair load\r\nfor a pack-horse; the flesh, which is very insipid and usually quite\r\ndestitute of fat, resembling very coarse beef in quality. A joint is\r\ntherefore never dressed by the good vrow without having first been\r\ngarnished with huge lumps of sheep’s-tail fat,--a _sine quâ non_ in\r\nDutch cookery,--dexterously thrust with the point of the thumb into\r\nperforations carved for their reception. This done, it is placed in\r\nthe iron oven, with abundance of lard, and literally baked to rags!\r\nOn account of its leanness, however, it is generally cut into strips,\r\nand converted into ‘_biltong_,’ by being dried in the sun. The silky\r\ntail of the Gnoo, which is in great demand for making chowries, forms\r\nan article of export; and the hide, when brayed, is employed by the\r\ncolonists for _riems_, or thongs, with which to harness oxen in the\r\nteam, and indeed for every purpose to which hempen rope, twine, and\r\nstring are usually applied in other countries.”\r\n\r\nAt the present time, we fear, the White-tailed Gnu affords neither\r\nsport nor food to the Boer hunter. Modern authorities assure us that\r\nthis Antelope, formerly found in such vast numbers on the plains of the\r\ninterior, now only remains upon one or two farms in the north of the\r\nCape Colony in Victoria West. So late as from 1850 to 1857 it was still\r\nfairly abundant between Colesberg and Hanover, but has now perished in\r\nthis district. Moreover, as this species has never been known to exist\r\nbeyond the Limpopo, there is not the slightest chance of its being\r\nfound anywhere further north.\r\n\r\nThe White-tailed Gnu is an apt subject for domestication. Cornwallis\r\nHarris tells us that “when captured young it may easily be reared by\r\nhand upon cow’s milk, and may readily be induced to herd with cattle\r\nupon the farm, going out to the pasture, and returning with them, and\r\nexhibiting little inclination to reclaim its pristine liberty.” It\r\nhas thus happened that specimens of it have been brought to Europe\r\nfrom an early period. We have already mentioned that one was living at\r\nAmsterdam in 1776, and others, no doubt, were introduced subsequently.\r\nIn the Knowsley Menagerie both the White-tailed and Brindled Gnus found\r\na place, and the young of both the species were figured from life by\r\nWaterhouse Hawkins, as we know from the series of magnificent drawings\r\nof the animals in the Knowsley Menagerie issued in 1850.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 15.\r\n\r\n  Young White-tailed Gnu (five months old).\r\n\r\n  (Zool. Soc. Gard. 1894.)]\r\n\r\nAt the Knowsley auction in 1851 only a pair of the present species\r\nwere put up for sale. They were purchased by a dealer for Wombwell’s\r\nMenagerie at the price of £283 10_s_.\r\n\r\nThe Zoological Society seems to have acquired examples of the\r\nWhite-tailed Gnu as early as 1830, and this animal has remained\r\nrepresented in the collection, except for a few short intervals, ever\r\nsince. Unfortunately, however, the Society was never successful in\r\ngetting a breeding pair together until about two years ago, when a fine\r\nyoung male and two females were purchased of Mr. C. Reiche, of Alfeld.\r\nThese have thriven well in the Antelope-House, and the first young Gnu\r\nwas born on the 7th of March last. It grew fast and at the present time\r\nit is nearly as large as its parents.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 15 _a_.\r\n\r\n  Young White-tailed Gnu (eight months old).\r\n\r\n  (Zool. Soc. Gard. 1894.)]\r\n\r\nThe accompanying drawings by Mr. Smit (figs. 15 and 15 _a_) show\r\nthis animal at the respective ages of five months and eight months.\r\n\r\nThe most successful results, however, in breeding the White-tailed\r\nGnu have been obtained by Mr. F. E. Blaauw, Secretary to the Royal\r\nZoological Society of Amsterdam, in his park at Westerveld, near\r\nHilversum, in North Holland, on which he has been kind enough to\r\nfurnish us with the following information:--Mr. Blaauw purchased\r\nhis first pair of Gnus in 1886 from the Jardin d’Acclimatation at\r\nParis. They arrived in winter and were kept in a covered shed without\r\nartificial warmth until the following spring, when they were turned\r\nout to a grass enclosure of about eight acres, well sheltered by\r\nplantations, and with a shed divided into compartments in one corner.\r\nThe Gnus and their descendants have been kept in this enclosure ever\r\nsince. In winter they are usually confined inside the house and fed on\r\nhay and oats, because the young ones are frequently born in winter and\r\nrequire a certain amount of protection. In the summer the Gnus never\r\nenter the shed, and subsist entirely by grazing.\r\n\r\nTreated in this fashion the Gnus in Mr. Blaauw’s possession have\r\nsucceeded in a wonderful way. From the single pair originally purchased\r\nand the two young females first born, no less than fourteen young Gnus\r\nhave been successfully reared, and only two have been lost, having been\r\nborn in the open field during severe frost.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaauw’s present herd consists of the original pair purchased in\r\n1886, two adult females (the offspring of this pair born in 1886 and\r\n1887), and two young ones born in May and June of the present year.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaauw has ascertained by frequent observation that the period of\r\ngestation in the White-tailed Gnu varies from 8¼ to 8½ months. Only a\r\nsingle young one has ever been produced at a birth. The female suckles\r\nher young for seven or eight months, but it commences to eat grass when\r\nabout a week old.\r\n\r\nIn the ‘Proceedings’ of the Zoological Society of London, Mr. Blaauw\r\nhas published an article on the development of the horns of the young\r\nGnu, two of the figures of which we are enabled to reproduce here by\r\nthe kind permission of that Society. The first figure (15 _b_)\r\nrepresents the first stage of the horns, in which they are perfectly\r\nstraight and more or less divergent; the second figure (15 _c_)\r\nrepresents the horns when the animal is about 19 months old. The former\r\nstraight portion has now become the terminal half, and the basal\r\nportion, though not yet quite fully developed, inclines downwards and\r\noutwards. The bases of the horns are still far apart, and there is a\r\nwide piece of hairy scalp between them. In the adult stage (as shown\r\nin Plate XII.) the basal ends of the horns become enormously swollen\r\n(especially in the male) and nearly meet together in the middle line.\r\nIt should be further remarked that these swollen basal portions, which\r\nare smooth at first, become excessively corrugated and more highly\r\ndeveloped when the animals get old.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 15 _b_.\r\n\r\n  Horns of young Gnu (11 weeks old).\r\n\r\n  (P. Z. S. 1889, p. 2.)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 15 _c_.\r\n\r\n  Horns of young Gnu (19 months old).\r\n\r\n  (P. Z. S. 1889, p. 3.)]\r\n\r\nThe females of the Gnu, according to Mr. Blaauw’s observation, are very\r\nprolific. They begin to breed before they are two years old, and bear\r\na calf regularly nearly every fifteen months. They seem to stand the\r\ndamp and cold of the Dutch climate without the slightest difficulty. It\r\nwould even appear that they are specially suitable to domestication, as\r\nthe animals born in captivity exceed on an average the size of those\r\nfreshly imported from South Africa.\r\n\r\nThe White-tailed Gnu is only represented in the National Collection at\r\nthe British Museum by a single immature female, mounted, and not now in\r\ngood condition, besides several skulls and horns. A good wild-killed\r\nspecimen of it, were it possible to obtain such an animal, would be,\r\ntherefore, very acceptable.\r\n\r\n    _January, 1895._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     SUBFAMILY II. _CEPHALOPHINÆ._\r\n\r\n\r\n_General Characters._--Size medium or small.

SYLVICULTURIX.\r\n\r\nSize medium or small; build generally thick and clumsy; naked muzzle\r\nlarge; anteorbital glands opening into a row of pores, which form a\r\nlong naked line on each side of the muzzle; crown of head tufted, so\r\nthat the horns are often quite hidden in the hairs; tail short or\r\nmedium, not heavily tufted; mammæ four; lateral hoofs well developed.\r\n\r\nSkull with large lachrymal fossæ, but no fissure at the base of the\r\nnasals, and no large pits above or beneath the eyes; auditory bullæ\r\ndivided by a septum; upper molar teeth short and broad; in the larger\r\nspecies with an additional column on the inner side.\r\n\r\nHorns two, generally present in both sexes, short and spike-like,\r\nplaced very far back on the head, on the ends of the posteriorly\r\nextended frontals; directed straight backwards nearly in the line of\r\nthe profile, not twisted or curved; their bases often roughened or\r\nangulated.\r\n\r\n   _Distribution._ Africa south of the Sahara.\r\n\r\nThis genus, although large, and with species ranging in size from that\r\nof a small donkey down to that of a hare, is yet a very uniform and\r\nnatural one, and shows remarkably little diversity among its members\r\nin essential characters. To sportsmen in general the majority of the\r\nspecies are little known, partly owing to their being too small to\r\nafford any sport and with but poor horns for trophies, but mainly owing\r\nto their inhabiting thick bush, so that they are hardly ever seen. One\r\nspecies, however, the common S. African Duiker, the popular name of\r\nwhich we have extended to all the members of the genus, is well known\r\nto every sportsman who has visited that country, both on account of\r\nits extreme abundance in most localities, and of its inhabiting more\r\nopen districts than its congeners, the Bush-Duikers. It has allies in\r\nAbyssinia and Senegal, and the three have together been separated by\r\nsome authors as a distinct genus, bat this separation we are not at\r\npresent prepared to endorse.\r\n\r\nConsidering, then, all the Duikers as forming but one genus, we may\r\ndistinguish them according to the following synopsis, although,\r\nas three or four of the species are known from very insufficient\r\nmaterials, we may expect that the characters will require some\r\nmodification hereafter.\r\n\r\nFrom the localities appended it will be seen that the large majority\r\nof the species are West African in habitat, the great tropical forest\r\nwhich covers so much of that part of Africa being apparently especially\r\nsuited to their bush-loving habits.\r\n\r\n   A. Horns, when present, pointed directly backwards, in a line\r\n   with, or below the line of, the nasal profile; generally present\r\n   in the female.

Ears short, broad, and rounded, their\r\nlength much less than the distance from eye to muzzle. Fur very short\r\non the fore-quarters, longer on the hind back, but in adults worn off\r\nand showing the whitish underfur or naked skin round the base of the\r\ntail. General colour all over, of face, body above and below, and of\r\nlimbs, dark blackish brown. Crest orange or rufous, little developed in\r\nyouth, and again wearing off in old age. Muzzle, cheeks and chin, and\r\nextreme tips of ear whitish. Lumbar region with a broad pale yellowish\r\nmesial stripe running from the middle of the back on to the loins.\r\n\r\nIn extreme youth the hairs of the posterior half of the body are all\r\ntipped with white, except just along what becomes afterwards the pale\r\nlumbar stripe, where they have long blackish tips, entirely hiding the\r\nwhite; and the caudal region, afterwards whitish and partly naked, is\r\nclothed with long black hairs.\r\n\r\nSkull, in proportion to the size of the animal, delicate, slender, and\r\nelongate. Muzzle slender, tapering, not laterally swollen between the\r\npremolars and the anteorbital fossa. Anteorbital fossæ of medium depth.\r\nMesial notch of palate surpassing anteriorly the lateral ones by about\r\nhalf an inch, these latter comparatively deep and =V=-shaped.\r\n\r\nHorns long and tapering, lying back in or below the line of the nasal\r\nprofile, rather bowed downwards terminally. Divergent, slender, evenly\r\ntapering, but little roughened at base; those of male and female almost\r\nprecisely alike, except that the latter are slightly smaller. Length\r\n(♂) 6·4 inches; basal diameter going about 5 or 5½ times in the length.\r\n\r\nDimensions:--♀. Height at shoulder 34 inches, ear 4, hind foot 13·5.\r\n\r\nSkull (♂): basal length 10·3 inches, greatest breadth 4·9, muzzle to\r\norbit 6·5.\r\n\r\n   _Hab._ West Coast of Africa, from Liberia to Angola.\r\n\r\nWe commence our history of this numerous group of Antelopes, for which\r\nwe adopt the term “Duiker” (_i.e._ “Diver”), originally given by the\r\nBoers of the Cape to _C. grimmi_, as a vernacular name, with two\r\nspecies readily distinguishable from the remainder by their greater\r\nsize, but not apparently otherwise divergent in structure. These are\r\nthe Yellow-backed Duiker and Jentink’s Duiker.\r\n\r\nThe eminent Swedish naturalist, Adam Afzelius, a pupil of Linnæus,\r\nand subsequently editor of his master’s autobiography, resided for\r\ntwo years (1792–94) on the West Coast of Africa, as botanist to the\r\nSierra Leone Company. Amongst numerous papers embracing the results\r\nof his researches on the West-African fauna and flora, he published\r\nin 1815, in the ‘Nova Acta’ of the Royal Society of Sciences of\r\nUpsala, a learned treatise on Antelopes generally, and specially\r\nupon those of Guinea. In the course of this memoir he described and\r\nfigured for the first time the present species, calling it _Antilope\r\nsilvicultrix_, as being the “Bush-Goat” of the colonists. Afzelius\r\nspeaks of it as not uncommon in the hills round Sierra Leone,\r\nparticularly in the districts adjoining the rivers Pongas and Quia.\r\nHere it is not met with among the rocks, but inhabits the lower tracts\r\nof the bush, either solitary or, in the rutting-season, in pairs, and\r\noccasionally in small herds. It hides itself in the bush by daytime,\r\nbut comes out in the early morning to feed in the open spaces, where\r\nthe hunters lie in wait for it. Its flesh is stated to be much esteemed\r\nas food, although it has a strong musky scent, particularly at certain\r\nseasons of the year.\r\n\r\nAfter Afzelius subsequent authors were for many years content to\r\ncopy his notes and description, and we get no further information on\r\nthe subject till we come to 1850, when the species was figured in\r\nthe ‘Knowsley Menagerie’ by Waterhouse Hawkins from specimens living\r\nin that magnificent collection. In this set of drawings it appears\r\ntwice--first on plate viii. fig. 1 (erroneously named _Cephalophus\r\npunctulatus)_, which seems to have been taken from a young individual\r\nof this Antelope; and secondly on plate xxiii. fig. 3, as _Cephalophus\r\nsylvicultrix_, in which the adult, or at any rate a more advanced\r\nstage, is represented. At the date of the sale of the Knowsley\r\nMenagerie in 1851 it does not seem that any specimens of this Antelope\r\nwere left in the collection; but a young example, no doubt one of those\r\nthat died in the Menagerie, had been presented by Lord Derby to the\r\nZoological Society of London, whence it subsequently passed into the\r\ncollection of the British Museum. From the labels on this and other\r\nspecimens we learn that they were obtained by Whitfield, a well-known\r\ncollector formerly in the employment of Lord Derby, at Sierra Leone.\r\n\r\nLittle further information respecting this species is available until\r\n1870, when the Zoological Society, on March 24th, purchased a single\r\nliving example of it from Cross of Liverpool, as recorded in the\r\nSociety’s ‘Proceedings’ (P. Z. S. 1870, p. 220). This animal, however,\r\ndid not live long in the Society’s Menagerie, as it died on the 14th\r\nJuly of the same year. Its body was disposed of to Mr. E. Gerrard, jr.,\r\nby whom it was stuffed and sold to the Melbourne Museum.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 16.\r\n\r\n  Skull of _Cephalophus sylvicultrix_, ad.\r\n\r\n  (P. Z. S. 1865, p. 205.)]\r\n\r\nThe only modern authority that speaks of this Antelope is Mr.\r\nBüttikofer, of the Leyden Museum, who made two zoological voyages\r\nto Liberia in 1880 and 1886. In Dr. Jentink’s list of the Liberian\r\nmammals obtained by Mr. Büttikofer and his fellow collectors in Liberia\r\n(Notes Leyden Mus. vol. x. p. 20) it is recorded that _Cephalophus\r\nsylvicultrix_ is said to occur sparingly on the Jackson and Mahfa\r\nrivers in that country, but to be more common on the Manna and Solyman\r\nrivers. But Mr. Büttikofer, in spite of all his efforts, did not\r\nsucceed in obtaining specimens.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 16 _a_.\r\n\r\n  Skull of _Cephaloplms sylvicultrix_, jr.\r\n\r\n  (P. Z. S. 1871, p. 594.)]\r\n\r\nAlthough, as already stated, originally discovered in Sierra\r\nLeone, the Yellow-backed Duiker seems to have a somewhat extended\r\ndistribution along the western coast of Africa, reaching altogether\r\nfrom Liberia to the Congo. A pair of mounted specimens and a skeleton\r\nin the British Museum were transmitted from Fantee by the native\r\ncollector Aubinn. The same collection also contains skins from Lagos,\r\nprocured by Sir Alfred Moloney, and two skulls and a skin from Gaboon,\r\nbrought to England by Mr. DuChaillu on his return from his celebrated\r\ngorilla-hunting expedition. Upon one of these skulls in 1865, Dr. Gray\r\nestablished his _Cephalophus longiceps_, and upon the second skull\r\nand the skin which accompanied it, in 1871, the same author based his\r\n_C. melanoprymnus_. Thomas has shown (P. Z. S. 1892, p. 416) that\r\nboth these names are merely synonyms of, _C. sylmcultrix_[12].\r\nWe may add we have as yet no information as to the range of this\r\nspecies into the interior, except that Herr Matschie has recorded its\r\noccurrence in Togoland; but it must be explained that our knowledge of\r\nthe distribution of West-African mammals is still woefully deficient.\r\nAs the same gentleman informs us, there is, besides several skins\r\nfrom Togoland, a stuffed example in the Berlin Museum sent by Herr\r\nPechuel-Loesche from Longobondo.\r\n\r\nOur illustration of this species on Plate XIII. is copied from a\r\nwatercolour drawing taken in April 1894 by Keulemans, from a fine\r\nmale specimen living in the Zoological Gardens of Rotterdam. As this\r\nanimal was received from the Congo in June 1891 (presented by Heer A.\r\nde Bloeme) it must be necessarily quite adult. Mr. Keulemans’ notes on\r\nit are as follows:--“Head dark grey; neck grey, shading into brownish\r\nand becoming blackish near the shoulders; hairs of neck and head very\r\nshort and glossy; general colour dark brown, with a bluish gloss,\r\ngetting blacker on the buttocks, where the hairs are long; tail short\r\nand black; large plaque on the back and buttocks and tuft between\r\nthe horns brownish ochre.” Our second figure (Plate XIV. fig. 2),\r\nwhich was prepared by Mr. Smit under Sir Victor Brooke’s directions,\r\nprobably represents a young male of this species; but we do not know\r\nfor certain from what specimen it was taken. The figure of Gray’s\r\n_C. melanoprymnus_ in the Zoological Society’s ‘Proceedings’ for\r\n1871 (pl. xliv.) was drawn from a still younger animal, probably of\r\nabout the same stage as the figure of “_C. punctulatus_” in the\r\n‘Knowsley Menagerie.’ It will be observed how greatly the colour of the\r\nback varies in these specimens of different ages.\r\n\r\n   _May, 1895._\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    THE BOOK OF ANTELOPES, PL.

In other respects also it agrees so closely with that\r\nof _C. sylvicultrix_ that, had the external characters not been\r\nknown, the two species would have been hardly supposed to be different.\r\nSuch differences as there are, however, have been fully pointed out in\r\nThomas’s monograph.\r\n\r\nHorns long, tapering, placed in the line of the nasal profile,\r\ndivergent as in _C. sylvicultrix_, those of female 6·1 inches\r\nlong, base not specially thickened, basal diameter going about 5½ times\r\nin the length.\r\n\r\nDimensions:--♀. Height at withers 30 inches, ear 4, hind foot 12.\r\n\r\nSkull (♀): basal length 10·5 inches, greatest breadth 5, muzzle to\r\norbit 6·5\r\n\r\n   _Hab._ Liberia.\r\n\r\nThe present Duiker nearly equals the preceding species in size, but,\r\nas will be seen by the Plate, is immediately distinguishable by marked\r\ndifferences in colour, its black head and neck rendering it very\r\nconspicuous. Its discovery is due to Mr. F. X. Stampfli, a naturalist\r\nwho made two expeditions to Liberia, in 1884 and 1886, to collect\r\nspecimens for the Leyden Museum. In the first of these he was alone;\r\nin the second he was accompanied by Mr. Büttikofer, the well-known\r\nConservator of that institution.\r\n\r\nThe Black-headed Duiker was first described by Dr. Jentink, the\r\nDirector of the Leyden Museum, in 1885, from a single female specimen\r\nprocured near Schieffelinsville, on the Junk River, by Stampfli in the\r\npreceding year. Unfortunately Dr. Jentink referred the specimen to\r\n_C. longiceps_ of Gray, a species based on a skull brought home\r\nfrom Gaboon by Mr. DuChaillu. In doing this he was perfectly justified,\r\non account of the extraordinarily close resemblance of its skull to\r\nthat of _C. longiceps_. But Thomas subsequently showed that\r\nDuChaillu’s Gaboon skull (as already mentioned above) is undoubtedly\r\nreferable to the nearly allied _C. sylvicultrix_. Under these\r\ncircumstances it became necessary to give another scientific name\r\nto the present species, and Thomas selected the appropriate term\r\n_jentinki_; as it was Dr. Jentink’s “carefulness, led astray by\r\nDr. Gray’s serious mistakes,” that had “caused him to make the venial\r\nerror just referred to.”\r\n\r\nDuring his second expedition, in 1887, Mr. Stampfli procured two more\r\nexamples of this Antelope on the Farmington River. Like the first, both\r\nthese were females, and, as we are told by Dr. Jentink, do not differ\r\nin colour from the typical specimen. Mr. Stampfli’s notes on this\r\nAntelope are as follows:--\r\n\r\n“A little below Schieffelinsville, in the triangle between the Junk\r\nRiver on one side and its two confluents, the Du Queah and Farmington\r\nRivers, on the other, a wooded eminence called ‘Sharp Hill’ rises in\r\nthe middle of the marshes, to which, according to the testimony of the\r\nnatives, these animals are restricted. As in the dry season the marshes\r\ncannot be traversed in canoes, and yet are not sufficiently dry to be\r\npassed on foot, these Antelopes can only be obtained in the rainy\r\nseason, and it is said to be quite an exception for a specimen to be\r\nprocured except during that period.”\r\n\r\nIn the second volume of Mr. Büttikofer’s ‘Reisebilder aus Liberia,’\r\nwhich contains a complete account of the explorations and discoveries\r\nof himself and his companions in that country, will be found some\r\nadditional details on this Antelope. Mr. Büttikofer calls particular\r\nattention to the large size of the inguinal glands between the belly\r\nand the thigh in this Antelope. They are so large that they will easily\r\ncontain a lemon. These are said to be fat-glands, from which the beast\r\nextracts fat with its muzzle to lubricate its short, shining, hairy\r\ncoat. Mr. Büttikofer also says that this Antelope, although only\r\nobtained from Sharp Hill, certainly occurs in other parts of Liberia.\r\n\r\nOur figure of this Bush-Duiker (Plate XV.) has been prepared by Mr.\r\nSmit from the mounted specimen in the British Museum, which is the type\r\nof the species. It is one of the three specimens obtained in Liberia by\r\nMr. Stampfli, the other two remaining at Leyden. We believe that these\r\nare the only three specimens of this rare Antelope existing in any\r\nEuropean museum.\r\n\r\n    _May, 1895._\r\n\r\n\r\n                         21.

Hairs of crest\r\nchestnut-red at the base, and tipped with black: mingled with them are\r\nsome hairs which are dusky throughout, and others pure white. Anterior\r\nsurfaces of the legs somewhat lighter than the posterior surfaces.

These are generally of a rufous colour,\r\nvaried by more or less intense dark markings on the face and dorsal\r\nline, only _C. doriæ_, which we place by itself, having the back\r\ntransversely barred.\r\n\r\nSir John Willoughby’s volume on ‘East Africa and its Big Game’ gives an\r\nexcellent account of the adventures of himself and a party of friends\r\nduring a shooting-expedition to the hunting-grounds of Kilimanjaro and\r\nits neighbourhood, and of the great variety and enormous quantity of\r\nthe larger mammals to be met with, a few years ago, in that district.\r\nIn an appendix to the volume, contributed by Mr. H. C. V. Hunter,\r\nF.Z.S., is added a systematic account of the principal mammals met with\r\non the plains round Kilimanjaro and on the mountain itself, amongst\r\nwhich we find recorded such splendid Antelopes as the Eland, Koodoo,\r\nOryx, Hartebeest, Gnu, Pallah, Waterbuck, Reedbuck, and three kinds of\r\nGazelle. At the close of the list Mr. Hunter notes the occurrence, high\r\nup on Kilimanjaro, of a species of _Cephalophus_ “of a dark red\r\ncolour, much larger than the Common Duiker (_C. grimmi_). A male\r\nof this probably new Antelope, it is stated, had been killed by Dr.\r\nAbbott.” This, so far as we know, is the first published mention of the\r\nspecies of which we now speak as Abbott’s Duiker.\r\n\r\nDr. W. L. Abbott, who is thus alluded to, is an American naturalist\r\nand explorer who passed nearly two years, in 1888 and 1889, collecting\r\nobjects of natural history in the district of Kilimanjaro. On his\r\nreturn to America Dr. Abbott presented his whole collection to\r\nthe National Museum, which is under the charge of the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution at Washington. Mr. Frederick W. True, the Curator of the\r\nDepartment of Mammals, to whom was assigned the task of describing\r\nthe collection, speaks of it as “one of high scientific value.” “The\r\nspecimens,” he says, “have been prepared with much care, the skins\r\nbeing almost invariably accompanied by the skulls, and furnished with\r\nlabels giving the locality and date of capture, the sex, and other\r\ndata.” It included altogether about ninety skins and an equal number\r\nof skulls representing some thirty-eight species. Amongst these was\r\na single male example of the present Antelope, no doubt the specimen\r\nalluded to by Mr. Hunter which is stated to have been killed at a high\r\naltitude on Kilimanjaro. As there is no specimen of this Antelope\r\navailable for our use, we have, as already stated, extracted the more\r\nessential characteristics from Mr. True’s two accounts.\r\n\r\nMr. True was of opinion that _C. spadix_ is closely allied to\r\n_C. niger_, and even possibly identical with it. We think,\r\nhowever, that its nearest relatives are probably _C. natalensis_\r\nand _C. harveyi_, from which it is at once distinguishable by its\r\nlarger size.\r\n\r\n    _May, 1895._\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    THE BOOK OF ANTELOPES, PL.

Our figure of this species (Plate XVI.) was put on the\r\nstone by Mr. Smit from a sketch prepared by Mr. Wolf, and was probably\r\ntaken from one of the specimens in the British Museum; but of this, we\r\nregret to say, there is no certain record.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the Natal Duiker is due to Sir Andrew Smith, who met\r\nwith it in the forests of Natal and first described it in 1834 in one\r\nof his articles on African Zoology published in the ‘South African\r\nQuarterly Journal.’ Sir Andrew afterwards figured it in the volume of\r\nMammals of his ‘Illustrations of South African Zoology,’ where the\r\nfollowing notes are given on its habits:--“Both _C. cæruleus_ [=\r\n_C. monticola_, nob.] and _C. natalensis_ inhabit the African\r\nforests; the former towards the Cape of Good Hope, the latter to the\r\neastward about and beyond Port Natal. They both feed partly upon the\r\ngrass which occurs among the underwood, and partly upon the young\r\nleaves and shoots of the brushwood and small trees which exist in the\r\nsituations they inhabit; and to obtain the latter they may occasionally\r\nbe seen scrambling among shrubs, or ascending the stems of sloping\r\ntrees, so as to reach what they cannot attain while they are on the\r\nground.”\r\n\r\nBeyond a reference to its name in various lists and catalogues, we find\r\nlittle more recorded concerning this Antelope until modern days, when\r\nseveral experienced observers have mentioned it. In his ‘Rough Notes on\r\nthe Game and Natural History of South and South-east Africa,’ published\r\nin 1875, the Hon. W. H. Drummond mentions the “Red-buck,” as he calls\r\nit, as one of the two species of _Cephalophus_ that inhabit the\r\njungles of Natal, the other being “the Blue-buck” (_Cephalophus\r\nmonticola_). Of these, Mr. Drummond says the Red-buck “is the larger\r\nand also the least common. It is, as its name denotes, of a light\r\nyellowish-red colour, mingled with grey on the lower parts, and its\r\nchief peculiarity is a tuft of hair growing out of the forehead, which\r\ngives a curious appearance to the hornless does, while it partially\r\nconceals the small horns of the bucks. Its flesh is anything but good,\r\nand it is difficult to shoot, from the tremendous rushes it makes when\r\ndisturbed. So fast and heedlessly does it run, that I once saw a buck,\r\nthat had passed me while I was loading, entangle itself in a mass of\r\ncreepers, from which, despite its struggles, it was unable to escape\r\nuntil I released it with the help of my knife. It was quite uninjured,\r\nand I kept it in confinement for some weeks, but, like most Antelopes\r\nwhen caught full-grown, it ultimately pined away and died.”\r\n\r\nMessrs. Nicolls and Eglington, in their ‘Sportsman in South Africa’\r\n(1892), tell us that this Antelope is found only in Zululand, Natal,\r\nand the southern portions of Swaziland, but is everywhere very scarce.\r\nIt is, however, stated on good authority to have been found recently in\r\nSouth-eastern Mashonaland. In habits, these authors say, it resembles\r\nthe Common Duiker, except that it chooses dense forest as a residence.\r\n\r\nSo far as we know, but one specimen of the Natal Duiker has ever been\r\nbrought to Europe alive. This was a male which was purchased in 1880\r\n(March 14th), by the Zoological Society of London, of Mr. Charles\r\nJamrach, for the sum of £6 10_s_., and lived some months in the\r\nMenagerie.\r\n\r\nBesides the skin of an adult female of this species, received from Sir\r\nAndrew Smith as the type of _C. natalensis_, there is a mounted\r\npair in the National Museum, collected by Dr. A. Krauss, and received\r\nin exchange from the Stuttgart Museum. There are also skins of adults\r\nof both sexes and accompanying skulls in the same collection from the\r\nTransvaal, obtained by Dr. Percy Rendall, C.M.Z.S., in 1893 and 1894.\r\nDr. Rendall has kindly favoured us with the following notes upon the\r\npresent species of Duiker:--\r\n\r\n“The local Colonial name for this Antelope is the ‘Lesser Red-buck.’ To\r\nthe Swazis it is the ‘Incumbi,’ and to the Shangaans the ‘Mangule.’\r\n\r\n“Its occurrence I found confined to a very limited area, _i.e._\r\nthe slopes of the Makongwa Mountains, which are locally termed\r\n‘Moodie’s Concession,’ in the Barberton portion of the Transvaal,\r\nadjoining Swaziland. Here it was not uncommon in places; its resorts\r\nbeing always the wooded creeks or ‘dongas,’ where there is dense cover.\r\n\r\n“Its habits are so skulking that it is extremely hard to procure\r\nspecimens, even when the hunter is aware of its existence in a\r\nparticular locality. Nothing but a well organized beat with natives and\r\ndogs will make these animals break cover from the bush and long grass\r\nthey frequent.\r\n\r\n“I never heard of one being seen or shot in the open, and their spoor\r\nand droppings are only seen just on the outskirts of the cover, where\r\nthey feed at night.\r\n\r\n“The way in which they double and dodge the dogs and beaters in full\r\ncry is inimitable, and to an onlooker is most entertaining. Their\r\nvitality is wonderful, and their power of endurance before dogs\r\nconsiderable, especially considering their comparatively small size.\r\nThere is little difference between the respective weights of the sexes\r\nwhen adult, as I was surprised to find when I put them into the scale.\r\n\r\n“The female is always horned, and in two specimens that I dissected\r\neach was found to be carrying a quarter-grown (hairless) fœtus, in the\r\nmonth of April. A wounded animal that I saw pulled down by a dog gave\r\nvent to a prolonged squeal, not unlike a rabbit or hare does under\r\nsimilar circumstances, though fainter in volume.\r\n\r\n“The long tuft of hair around and between the horns is always more\r\nmarked in the male, and practically masks the horns. The flesh is not\r\nappreciated by a European palate, though the reverse is the case with\r\nthe Swazis, as I have noticed.\r\n\r\n“_Measurements taken of three Adult Specimens, 15th April, 1894._\r\n\r\n    +---------------------------+-----------+-------------+-----------+\r\n    |                           |           |             |           |\r\n    |                           |   1.

So closely allied, however, are all the\r\nDuikers of the present section that, as will be seen from our list\r\nof synonyms, Harvey’s Duiker was associated first of all with _C.\r\nnatalensis_ and afterwards with _C. nigrifrons_, before it was\r\nrecognized by Thomas as having good claims to constitute an independent\r\nspecies. Thomas took his characters, which were published in the\r\n‘Annals of Natural History’ in 1893, from a head obtained by Mr. F. J.\r\nJackson in the Kilimanjaro district some years ago, and subsequently\r\npresented to the British Museum. In his chapter on “Game Districts and\r\nRoutes,” in the first volume of ‘Big Game Shooting,’ we find that Mr.\r\nJackson has mentioned the present species as met with along with the\r\nelephant in the dense and almost impenetrable forests near Taveta. At\r\nMr. Jackson’s suggestion Thomas appropriately dedicated the present\r\nspecies to Sir Robert Harvey, whose repeated expeditions to East Africa\r\nhave made us so well acquainted with the animals of that district.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 17.\r\n\r\n  Head of Harvey’s Duiker.\r\n\r\n  (From Mr. Jackson’s specimen.)]\r\n\r\nOn re-examining the specimens at the British Museum, Thomas discovered\r\nthat a skin obtained many years ago by Sir John Kirk near Malindi, on\r\nthe coast of British East Africa, and previously referred erroneously\r\nto _C. natalensis_ (owing to its having lost the fur off its\r\nface), likewise belongs to this species, which, as Mr. Jackson has\r\ninformed us, does occur in a patch of forest about one day south-west\r\nof Malindi.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt also that the Black-fronted Antelope obtained\r\nby Dr. W. L. Abbott near Taveta during his expedition of 1888–89, of\r\nwhich we have already spoken, and now in the National Museum of the\r\nUnited States at Washington, should be referred to _C. harveyi_.\r\nMr. True provisionally determined it as _C. nigrifrons_, not\r\nhaving specimens of that Antelope from the western coast to compare it\r\nwith, and has given us an excellent description of it in his memoir on\r\nDr. Abbott’s mammals.\r\n\r\nMore recently, again, this species has been obtained by Capt. Bottego\r\nin South Somaliland, as mentioned in Thomas’s report on the mammals\r\npresented by that sportsman to the Museo Civico at Genoa.\r\n\r\nOur figure of Harvey’s Duiker (Plate XVII.) has been prepared by Mr.\r\nSmit from Sir John Kirk’s specimen in the British Museum, the head in\r\nthe same collection obtained by Mr. Jackson having been used where Sir\r\nJohn Kirk’s specimen is imperfect.\r\n\r\n    _May, 1895._\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    THE BOOK OF ANTELOPES, PL.

Centre of face and crest deep black, contrasting markedly with\r\nthe rufous superciliary streaks. Nape browner. Feet and tip of tail\r\nblackish, a few white hairs in the terminal tuft of the latter. Hoofs\r\napparently longer in proportion than usual; lower edge of the posterior\r\nouter hoof 1·57 inch in length.\r\n\r\nHorns, judging only from the cores, decidedly short, and but little\r\nexpanded at their base; the cores in an adult male about 1·9 inch long.\r\nTheir set parallel to, and a little below, the level of the nasal\r\nprofile.\r\n\r\nSkull with the frontal region decidedly convex. Muzzle rather narrow\r\nand elongated. Anteorbital fossæ of medium depth. Median posterior\r\npalatine notch some distance (⅓ inch in type) in front of the level of\r\nthe lateral notches.\r\n\r\nDimensions:--♂. Approximate height at withers 19 inches, ear 2·3, hind\r\nfoot 9·2.\r\n\r\nSkull: basal length 6·3 inches, greatest breadth 3·1, muzzle to orbit\r\n3·6.\r\n\r\n   _Hab._ Coast of Western Africa from Cameroons to Gaboon.\r\n\r\nAlthough the great wood-region of Western Africa has been repeatedly\r\nvisited by naturalists since the days of Afzelius in the last century,\r\nand many collections have been formed there, very little has been\r\nrecorded respecting the habits of the mammals of this part of the\r\ncontinent. The reason of this, no doubt, is mainly the impenetrable\r\nnature of the forests and bush which cover the whole country and\r\nwhich allow much fewer observations to be made upon the habits and\r\npeculiarities of the animals than in the more open and easily traversed\r\ndistricts of the Ethiopian Region. Of the present and several other\r\nspecies of this genus of Antelopes, for example, we shall see that\r\nvery little information can be given except what results from the\r\nexamination of their skins and skulls brought home as specimens for our\r\nmuseums.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 18.\r\n\r\n  Skull of _Cephalophus nigrifrons_.\r\n\r\n  (P. Z. S. 1871, p. 598.)]\r\n\r\nLike Harvey’s Duiker of Eastern Africa, the Black-fronted Duiker, which\r\nis its representative and close ally in the great western wood-region,\r\ncarries a coat of a nearly uniform chestnut. Like _C. harveyi_,\r\nalso, it has a distinct black blaze down the centre of the face, whence\r\nthe appropriate name _C. nigrifrons_ has been bestowed on it.\r\nIts distinctions from Harvey’s Duiker, as pointed out by Thomas, are\r\nthat it is of a much more uniform colour all over and hardly paler\r\nbelow, while in the last-named species the cheeks, sides of the neck,\r\nand throat are of a pale bay, and the chin is white as in _C.\r\nnatalensis_. Its most striking characteristic is, however, the fact\r\nthat its hoofs are very much longer than is usual in the genus, an\r\nelongation which is probably due to its inhabiting marshy and boggy\r\nregions, where its long hoofs would prevent its sinking so deeply as it\r\notherwise would into the muddy soil.\r\n\r\nThe typical specimens of this Duiker formed part of the collection made\r\nby Mr. DuChaillu during his celebrated visit to the Gaboon in 1856 and\r\nthe following years, the greater part of which were ultimately acquired\r\nby the British Museum. On reference to the ‘Explorations and Adventures\r\nin Equatorial Africa’ of DuChaillu we can find no reference to it,\r\nunless, as is probable, it is alluded to as one of the “four species\r\nof Gazelle not yet determined,” which are enumerated in the appendix.\r\nWhen, however, DuChaillu’s specimens came under the experienced eye\r\nof the late Dr. Gray, on the occasion of his preparing a monograph of\r\nthe genus _Cephalophus_ (subsequently published in the Zoological\r\nSociety’s ‘Proceedings’ for 1871), it was quickly discovered that\r\namongst them was a representative of a new and distinct species of the\r\npresent genus, which was described and figured as _C. nigrifrons_.\r\nIn a subsequent communication to the ‘Annals of Natural History’ in\r\n1871, Dr. Gray described a specimen of what he believed to be another\r\nnew species of _Cephalophus_ under the name of _C. aureus_.\r\nOn this occasion he tells us that the specimens, both of his _C.\r\nnigrifrons_ and of his _C. aureus_, “had been sent home from\r\nAfrica by Mr. DuChaillu as materials for stuffing out the skin of a\r\nspecimen” of a larger Antelope (_Tragelaphus euryceros_). We\r\nbelieve it to be the fact that, as Sclater was assured by the late Dr.\r\nGray, he described four new species of Antelopes from skins found in\r\nthe interior of this _Tragelaphus_ when it was unstuffed for the\r\npurpose of being remounted for the collection of the British Museum. As\r\nregards the so-called _C. aureus_, however, a close examination of\r\nthe typical specimen, made by Thomas in 1892, convinced him that it was\r\na very young animal and was probably only an immature individual of the\r\npresent species. We may observe, however, that its body is far brighter\r\nand more fulvous than that of the adult, that the withers and shoulders\r\nare browner, and that the caudal tuft is more abundantly mixed with\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\nIn 1882, as recorded in the eighth edition of their ‘List of Animals,’\r\nthe Zoological Society acquired by purchase of Mr. Cross, of Liverpool,\r\na living specimen of the Black-fronted Antelope, which lived for about\r\nthree months in the Menagerie. Of this it can only be said that, like\r\nmost of the smaller Antelopes (if we except the Gazelles), it was shy\r\nand inoffensive in its disposition.\r\n\r\nThe existence of _C. nigrifrons_ in the Cameroons has been\r\nrecorded by Peters, who published in 1876 an account of the collection\r\nof Mammals made by Dr. Reinhold Buchholz in this and other localities\r\nin Western Africa. Buchholz, when at the Cameroons, obtained a specimen\r\nof the Black-fronted Duiker from the natives who had captured it alive\r\nwhen swimming across a river. He remarks on the prominent appearance\r\nof the inguinal glands, and says that the horns are very short and\r\nconical, and almost covered by the frontal hairs. The native name of\r\nthese _Cephalophi_ in the Cameroons is said to be “Ngolo.”\r\n\r\nOur figure of this Bush-Duiker (Plate XVIII. fig. 1) was prepared by\r\nMr. Smit under the direction of the late Sir Victor Brooke. It was\r\nprobably taken from the specimen in the British Museum, but of this we\r\nare not quite sure.\r\n\r\n    _May, 1895._\r\n\r\n\r\n                     25.

S. 1892, p. 420; =Lyd.= Horns and\r\n   Hoofs, p. 211 (1893).\r\n\r\nSize medium. General colour dull chestnut-rufous, with a black dorsal\r\nband. Face rufous, darker down the centre; crest mixed rufous and\r\nblack. Nape browner. Dorsal stripe commencing in front of the withers,\r\nnot pure black, but grizzled with rufous, and not at all sharply\r\ndefined laterally; posteriorly, however, on the tail it becomes\r\nabruptly very narrow and sharply defined, not covering the whole\r\nbreadth of the tail, but bordered on each side with rufous or white.\r\nEnd of tail with a large mixed black and white tuft. Under surface of\r\nbody from chin to anus, inner sides of forearms and hips, and also a\r\nline passing down the anterior side of the metatarsi, whitish or pure\r\nwhite; no trace of a darker sternal patch. Posterior faces of buttocks\r\nalso pure white, very different from the deep chestnut of this part in\r\n_C. dorsalis_.\r\n\r\nHorns of type (apparently ♀) conical, sharply pointed.\r\n\r\nSkull, so far as can be gathered from a young and very imperfect\r\nexample, with a slender narrow muzzle like that of _C. dorsalis\r\ncastaneus_, quite unlike the short conical one of _C. d.\r\ntypicus_.\r\n\r\nDimensions of the type (an immature specimen):--Height at withers 15\r\ninches, ear 2·5, hind foot 7·9.\r\n\r\n   _Hab._ Gaboon.\r\n\r\nThe White-bellied Duiker is another discovery of Dr. Gray’s, made, as\r\nin the case related in the former article, on a specimen obtained from\r\nthe interior of a stuffed example of _Tragelaphus euryceros_,\r\nreceived from Mr. DuChaillu. We may therefore fairly put down the\r\nlocality of the specimen as Gaboon, to which district of Western Africa\r\nboth of Mr. DuChaillu’s great journeys were confined. As in the former\r\ncase also, the present species was described in the ‘Annals of Natural\r\nHistory’ for 1873, in a supplementary paper to Dr. Gray’s revision of\r\nthe species of the present genus published in 1871. To what extent,\r\nhowever, the present is different from the allied species must remain\r\nuncertain until further specimens have been obtained, which, so far as\r\nwe are aware, has not yet been the case.\r\n\r\nThe typical example of _Cephalophus leucogaster_ is probably a\r\nfemale and is quite immature, with the milk-molars still in position\r\nand the third molar still below the bone, and it is difficult to arrive\r\nat a definite conclusion from such a specimen. At the same time, as\r\nThomas has shown in his article on the genus _Cephalophus_,\r\npublished in 1892, it is not possible, in the present state of our\r\nknowledge, to refer the specimen to any described species. The black\r\ndorsal band distinguishes it from _C. nigrifrons_ and other\r\npreceding species, and the white hams and under surface from all the\r\nforms of the next following species--_C. dorsalis_--to which,\r\nperhaps, it most closely approximates. On the whole, therefore, we can\r\nat present only say that _C. leucogaster_ has been established on\r\na young specimen of a species of which the adult form is not yet known\r\nto us.\r\n\r\n    _May, 1895._\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    THE BOOK OF ANTELOPES.

General colour bright\r\nchestnut-rufous, with a dark mesial stripe running from the nose to the\r\ntail, only interrupted at the crest, which is sometimes rufous. Centre\r\nline of face brown; superciliary streaks bright rufous. Crest variable,\r\neither black, mixed black and rufous, or wholly rufous. Dorsal stripe\r\nbecoming absolutely black on the back, sometimes sharply defined\r\nthroughout, sometimes broadening out on the withers into an ill-defined\r\nband passing down the shoulders towards the fore legs. Under surface,\r\ninner sides of limbs, and back of hams rufous like the sides; a black\r\nor blackish longitudinal patch present in the sternal region. Fore\r\nlimbs brown, from the shoulder downwards, hind limbs from just above\r\nthe heel. Tail black above throughout, the black covering nearly the\r\nwhole breadth of the tail, white beneath terminally.\r\n\r\nHorns placed about in the same straight line as the nasal profile,\r\nthose of male about 2·8 inches long, slender, tapering, not thickened\r\nor roughened basally, the basal diameter going nearly five times in the\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nSkull with a remarkably short conical muzzle, the distance from the\r\nanterior rim of the orbit to the muzzle less than the zygomatic\r\nbreadth.

Teeth decidedly larger than in the typical form.\r\n\r\nDimensions of the type, an immature female:--Height at withers 19\r\ninches, ear 2·4, hind foot 8.\r\n\r\nSkull: basal length (c.) 6 inches, greatest breadth 3·3, orbit to\r\nmuzzle 3·5.\r\n\r\nThis subspecies is based on a female specimen referred by Gray[13] to\r\n“_Cephalophus badius_”; its skull has been figured by him under\r\nthat name. Thomas has, however, shown that the skull of this specimen\r\ndiffers so much from that of typical _C. dorsalis_ that, in spite\r\nof its external resemblance, it should be looked upon as representing\r\na distinct subspecies; and this view we have accepted in the present\r\nwork. Additional specimens will, however, be needed before its position\r\ncan be satisfactorily determined. For the present, therefore, we\r\npublish all that is known about it, and trust that further specimens\r\nfrom different localities will clear up the precise relationship it\r\nbears to the true _C. dorsalis_, and also to its close ally _C.\r\nleucogaster_.\r\n\r\n   _Hab._ Cameroons.\r\n\r\nThe Bay Duiker, as this Antelope has long been called, is better known\r\nthan the species which we have last spoken of and appears to have a\r\nwider distribution. At the same time it varies a good deal in the\r\ncolour of its fur, both according to age and in the various localities\r\nin which it is found. Gray, who was an habitual species-maker, has, as\r\nwas pointed out by Sclater in 1869, described it under three different\r\nnames, based on age-changes and on slight variations in colour.\r\n\r\nCommencing in 1846, Gray established his _Cephalophus dorsalis_\r\non a specimen in the British Museum, which had been brought to this\r\ncountry alive by Mr. Whitfield from Sierra Leone and had died in the\r\nSurrey Zoological Gardens. In 1850 he figured the same species in\r\nthe ‘Knowsley Menagerie’ from a drawing made by Waterhouse Hawkins.\r\nThis drawing was probably taken from living specimens in the Knowsley\r\nCollection, also procured by Whitfield, who was a collector employed\r\nby Lord Derby. In 1852 Dr. Gray seems to have come to the conclusion\r\nthat the animal figured in the ‘Knowsley Menagerie’ was not the same\r\nas the true _Cephalophus dorsalis_ originally described from\r\nMr. Whitfield’s specimen, and, accordingly, in his list of Ungulata\r\nFurcipeda in the British Museum, named the former _Cephalophus\r\nbadius_, retaining the name _Cephalophus dorsalis_ for the\r\nlatter. Dr. Gray, however, did not state exactly how the two species\r\nare to be distinguished, and he afterwards united them under one\r\nheading. The typical specimen of _C. breviceps_ was described when\r\nalive in the Zoological Gardens, and, as noticed by Gray himself,\r\n“assumed all the appearance, as it grew up, of _C. badius_”\r\n\r\nAs recorded by Temminck in his ‘Esquisses Zoologiques sur la Côte de\r\nGuinée,’ the well-known Dutch collector Pel met with this Antelope in\r\nAshantee and Sierra Leone, where he states that it is found, although\r\nsomewhat rarely, in the littoral forests, showing itself only at night.\r\nTwo other collectors from Holland, Büttikofer and Stampfli, obtained\r\nspecimens of this species on the Junk River in Liberia, which were\r\nlikewise transmitted to the Leyden Museum.\r\n\r\nExamples of this species in the British Museum were procured in Fantee\r\nby the native collector Aubinn; and we may therefore state confidently\r\nthat the typical form of _C. dorsalis_ inhabits the whole\r\ncoast-region of Western Africa from Liberia to the mouth of the Niger.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, we pass southwards of the delta of the Niger and arrive\r\nat the higher ground of the Cameroons the typical _C. dorsalis_\r\nseems to be replaced by a slightly different local form, which Thomas\r\nin 1892 characterized as a subspecies, _C. dorsalis castaneus_.\r\nThis Antelope is rather larger than the typical form and the ears\r\nare apparently rather larger. The chestnut superciliary stripe is\r\nindistinct, far less bright than in the typical form, and the general\r\ncolour of the head is darker and duller. The typical specimen of\r\nthis subspecies, which is in the collection of the British Museum,\r\nis a female obtained by Crossley in the Cameroons. Besides the\r\ncolour-differences just mentioned the form of the skull, which is\r\nfigured in the ‘Hand-list of Ruminants’ as that of _C. badius_\r\n(_op. cit._ pl. xxx. fig. 1), is likewise peculiar. But further\r\nspecimens and more information are necessary before we can decide\r\nwhether it will be advisable to give the Cameroons animal the full rank\r\nof a species.\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned the existence of a living specimen of this\r\nDuiker in the Derby Menagerie. Living specimens of it have also been\r\nreceived on more than one occasion by the Zoological Society of London.\r\nIn 1861 an example was purchased of a dealer in Liverpool and lived\r\nmore than two years in the Society’s Gardens. A second specimen,\r\nquite immature on its arrival, was purchased in February 1866 and was\r\nshortly afterwards described by Gray as _Cephalophus breviceps_.\r\nThis was a female, and, being placed in the same compartment of the\r\nGazelle-sheds as a male of the allied species _C. rufilatus_,\r\nbred with it when adult. It produced a young one in January, 1869,\r\nand died soon afterwards. A third specimen of the same Antelope was\r\nbrought home from the Gold Coast and presented to the Society by Mr.\r\nC. B. Mosse, Staff-Surgeon, R.N., in October, 1869. This specimen was\r\nfigured in the Zoological Society’s ‘Proceedings’ for that year (_op.\r\ncit._ pi. xlvi.). Mr. Mosse presented another from the same district\r\nin 1874. Since that period six other specimens of this Antelope have\r\nbeen acquired at different dates.\r\n\r\n    _May, 1895._\r\n\r\n\r\n                         27.

Nape and sides of neck brown or blackish, but\r\nthe hairs here so thin and short that the skin shows through and the\r\ngeneral colour is but little affected.

Female\r\nabout an inch and a half in length, conical, smooth, broad at base,\r\npointed terminally, their length not twice their basal diameter.\r\n\r\nSkull with a very considerable convexity in the frontal region.\r\nAnteorbital fossæ shallow. Posterior palate with the three notches,\r\nmedian and two lateral, all at about the same level.\r\n\r\nDimensions:--♂. Height at withers 22 inches, ear 3, hind foot 9·4.\r\n\r\nSkull (♂, not fully adult): basal length 7·2 inches, greatest breadth\r\n3·5, muzzle to orbit 4·4.\r\n\r\n   _Hab._ Coast of West Africa, from Liberia to the Cameroons.\r\n\r\nOgilby’s Duiker, which we now proceed to consider, is closely allied to\r\nthe last species, and like it is of a generally rufous colour with a\r\nblack dorsal stripe, but it is immediately distinguishable by its pale\r\nyellowish face and flanks. It was first described by Waterhouse, as\r\nlong ago as 1838, from specimens presented to the Zoological Society’s\r\nMuseum by Mr. George Knapp, who had received them from the island of\r\nFernando Po, and was named after William Ogilby, formerly Secretary to\r\nthe Society and a great authority upon the Ruminant Mammals. When the\r\nZoological Society’s Museum was broken up the typical specimen passed\r\ninto the British Museum, where it now is. About ten years afterwards\r\nOgilby’s Duiker was figured by Fraser in his ‘Zoologia Typica,’\r\nprobably from the typical specimen. Fraser, who had visited Fernando Po\r\nhimself, states that this Antelope is extremely common in that island\r\nand is much esteemed by the natives as an article of food. In his\r\nconjecture that its range “is confined to that island,” he was no doubt\r\nin error, as we have several trustworthy notices of its occurrence\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nSpecimens of the present species are recorded by Dr. Jentink as having\r\nbeen procured on the Du Queah and Farmington Rivers in Liberia by\r\nBüttikofer and Stampfli. These are in the Leyden Museum, as is also\r\na female specimen from Ashantee. In his ‘Reisebilder aus Liberia’\r\nBüttikofer tells us that the present species is common in the Liberian\r\nforests.\r\n\r\nIn the Cameroons the present species has been met with by the German\r\ncollectors Preuss and Morgan, as recorded by Herr Matschie, and in\r\nTogoland, on the same authority, by Kling and Büttner. Thus there can\r\nbe little doubt that Ogilby’s Duiker ranges along the woody littoral of\r\nWestern Africa from Liberia to the Cameroons.\r\n\r\nOgilby’s Duiker having been figured by Waterhouse Hawkins in the\r\n‘Knowsley Menagerie’ it is probable that one or more living specimens\r\nof it were exhibited in that splendid collection, but we can find\r\nno record of examples of it ever having been received alive by the\r\nZoological Society of London.\r\n\r\nOur figure of this species (Plate XVIII. fig. 2) was prepared by Mr.\r\nSmit, under Sir Victor Brooke’s directions, probably from specimens in\r\nthe British Museum, but of this we have no certain evidence.\r\n\r\n    _May, 1895._\r\n\r\n\r\n                         28.

General colour of body yellowish\r\nbrown, becoming more rufous posteriorly. Forehead and crest rich\r\nrufous. Chin and throat white, rest of under surface yellowish grey.\r\nBack with a broad black dorsal band commencing behind the withers,\r\nbroadening posteriorly, and involving the whole of the hams and backs\r\nof the hind legs down to the heels, and also the tail, with the\r\nexception of the extreme tip beneath, where the hairs are white-tipped.\r\nOn the sides of the thighs, edging the black, the general body-colour\r\nbecomes rich rufous.\r\n\r\nHorns short, directed backwards, lying below the level of the nasal\r\nprofile.\r\n\r\nDimensions:--♀. “Total length to tip of tail 46 inches, tail 8, ear\r\n2·7.”\r\n\r\nSkull (taken from figure, and therefore only approximate): basal length\r\n6·4 inches, anterior edge of orbit to muzzle (more or less decreased by\r\nperspective) 3·8.\r\n\r\nThe description is compiled from Dr. Peters’s description and figure of\r\nthis striking species, of which no specimen has come to England.\r\n\r\n   _Hab._ Gaboon.\r\n\r\nThe present Duiker, although evidently belonging to the same group\r\nas the preceding species, and probably most nearly allied to _C.\r\ndorsalis_, is separated by prominent well-marked characters,\r\ncombining a brownish body and dark dorsal stripe with bright rufous\r\nmarkings on the forehead and haunches, which render it easily\r\ndistinguishable.\r\n\r\nPeters’s Duiker was described in 1876 by the great zoologist after whom\r\nwe have fashioned its English name, from a single specimen obtained\r\nby the late Professor Dr. Reinhold Buchholz during his sojourn in\r\nWestern Africa, and transmitted to the Berlin Museum. In his notes upon\r\nthis species Peters informs us that the specimen described, which is\r\nan adult female, was brought to Buchholz alive in Gaboon on the 18th\r\nAugust, 1874, and lived two days in captivity. Buchholz stated that the\r\nname of this Antelope in the Mpongwe dialect was “_Mbindi_” and\r\nnoted that the iris was brown, the muffle blackish, and that the animal\r\nwas provided with large purse-like inguinal glands, like other species\r\nof the genus.\r\n\r\nPeters has given a good coloured figure of the specimen in the\r\n‘Monatsbericht’ of the Royal Prussian Academy of Sciences, in which his\r\nmemoir on Buchholz’s mammals is published, and likewise an excellent\r\nfigure of its skull of the natural size.\r\n\r\nWe are not aware that any other museum has been fortunate enough to\r\nobtain specimens of this rare Antelope.\r\n\r\n    _May, 1895._\r\n\r\n\r\n                      29.

General colour partly bright yellowish\r\nrufous, and partly a peculiar bluish grey; the former colour covering\r\nthe sides of the face, the whole of the neck, the shoulders, flanks,\r\nrump, and belly, while the latter prevails on the middle line of the\r\nnose, on the forehead, occiput, back of ears, centre of back from\r\nwithers to rump, and all four limbs, from the elbows and middles of\r\nlower legs downwards. Crest long, blackish. Tail rufous above basally,\r\nblack terminally.\r\n\r\nHorns placed in the same line as the nasal profile; those of male\r\nshort, conical, pointed (but no adult wild specimen is available for\r\ndescription); those of female rudimentary, mere low rounded knobs,\r\nhardly projecting above the skin of the head.\r\n\r\nSkull with a long and slender muzzle. Anteorbital fossæ remarkably\r\ndeep, more so than in any other species. Mesial palatal notch about a\r\nquarter of an inch anterior to the lateral ones.\r\n\r\nDimensions:--♂. Height at withers 14 inches, ear 2·3, hind foot 7.\r\n\r\nSkull (♀): basal length 5·2, greatest breadth 2·6, orbit to muzzle 2·9.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to say to which of the other species this peculiar\r\nlittle animal is most nearly allied, especially in the absence of\r\nwild-killed male specimens with fully developed horns.\r\n\r\n   _Hab._ West Africa, from Gambia to the Niger.\r\n\r\nThe ninth and last species of the group of Bay Duikers, though\r\nagreeing with the preceding species in its generally rufous coat, is\r\ndistinguishable by its smaller size and lighter colour. The front and\r\ndorsal stripe are of a peculiar bluish grey instead of being black, and\r\nthe whole of the flanks and sides are of a light yellowish rufous.\r\n\r\nThe Red-flanked Duiker, as we propose to call it, appears to have been\r\nconfounded by Desmarest, Lesson, Gervais, and other French systematists\r\nwith the _Antilope grimmia_ of Pallas, which is _C. coronatus_--both\r\nthey and the latter ignoring the fact that the name “_grimmia_”\r\nproperly belongs to the Common Duiker, _C. grimmi_, of the Cape. This\r\nconfusion was first properly cleared up by Dr. Gray, as early as 1846,\r\nbut it is only quite recently that the correct names for the three\r\nspecies have come into general use. Desmarest, in his article on\r\n“_Antilope_” published in 1816 in the ‘Nouveau Dictionnaire d’Histoire\r\nNaturelle,’ was the first describer of the present animal under the\r\nname of _Antilope grimmia_; and in 1821 F. Cuvier, in his ‘Histoire\r\nNaturelle des Mammifères,’ gave a figure of it, from a specimen from\r\nSenegal, then living in the Jardin des Plantes, under the name of ‘Le\r\nGrimm.’\r\n\r\nIn 1846, in an article published in the ‘Annals and Magazine of Natural\r\nHistory,’ the late Dr. Gray first distinguished the present species\r\nfrom the “Grimm,” and proposed to call it by the appropriate name\r\n_Cephalophus rufilatus_. Dr. Gray based his description upon a\r\npair in the Derby Museum, and on a young female in the British Museum\r\nwhich had been presented to that collection by Lord Derby. This last\r\nspecimen, which may now be seen mounted in the Mammal-Gallery of\r\nthe National Collection, was obtained on the Gambia by Lord Derby’s\r\ncollector, Whitfield. The two types in the Derby Museum are stated to\r\nhave been obtained at Sierra Leone.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 19.\r\n\r\n  Skull of _Cephalophus rufilatus_, jr.\r\n\r\n  (P. Z. S. 1871, p. 597.)]\r\n\r\nIn the ‘Gleanings from the Knowsley Menagerie’ are contained two\r\nfigures of this animal: plate vi. fig. 3 gives a full-sized figure of\r\nwhat is apparently a female of this species, and plate ix. represents\r\nthe heads of both sexes. Both of these plates are marked as drawn by\r\nWaterhouse Hawkins from specimens living at Knowsley in 1843. Several\r\nspecimens of the Coquetoon, as this Antelope is sometimes called,\r\nhave also been received by the Zoological Society, but have not\r\nproved to be long-lived in this country. The first recorded specimen\r\nwas obtained in 1861, and others were subsequently acquired in 1867,\r\n1879, and 1880. These were all obtained from dealers and had no\r\ndefinite localities attached to them. But we are able to supply some\r\nindications of the range of this species from museum specimens. In the\r\nBritish Museum, besides Whitfield’s stuffed specimen from the Gambia\r\nalready alluded to, there is the skull of an adult animal from the\r\nsame locality obtained by Sir Gilbert Carter, and a young skull, which\r\nhas probably been correctly referred to this species from the Niger,\r\nobtained by Surgeon Baikie. In the Leyden Museum, as we find by Dr.\r\nJentink’s Catalogue, there is an adult female specimen procured at\r\nDabocrom, in Ashantee, by the collector Pel, and an adult male from\r\nSierra Leone received from the Bremen Museum. In reference to Pel’s\r\nspecimen, Temminck has informed us that this species is rare on the\r\nGuinea coast, but more common in the forests of Sierra Leone. We also\r\nfind this species recorded by Herr Matschie as one of the Antelopes met\r\nwith by the collectors of the Berlin Museum in the German Protectorate\r\nof Togoland. We may therefore conclude that the Red-flanked Duiker\r\ninhabits the whole coast-land of Western Africa between the British\r\nSettlement of Gambia and the River Niger.\r\n\r\nOur figure of this species (Plate XIX. fig. 1) was prepared under Sir\r\nVictor Brooke’s direction, very probably from one of the specimens in\r\nthe Liverpool Museum.\r\n\r\n    _May, 1895._\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    THE BOOK OF ANTELOPES, PL.

Tail rufous, more or\r\nless mixed with black above, white below.\r\n\r\nHorns short, in the same line as the nasal profile, in the male barely\r\ntwo inches long, conical, tapering, sharply pointed, their greatest\r\nbasal diameter going about 2½ times in their length; in the female less\r\nthan one inch in an adult, smoother than in the male, but otherwise\r\nsimilar in character.\r\n\r\nSkull stoutly built. Nasal region broad, flat, parallel-sided.\r\nAnteorbital fossæ very shallow. Frontal region not specially swollen.\r\nHorn-cores so pressed downwards and backwards as to cause marked\r\ndepressions behind and below them on the parietals. Palate with its\r\nthree posterior notches about level.\r\n\r\nDimensions:--♂. Height at withers 16 inches, ear 2·9, hind foot 6·8 (in\r\na female, rather older, 7·3).\r\n\r\nSkull: basal length 5·8 inches, greatest breadth 2·8, orbit to muzzle\r\n3·4.\r\n\r\n   _Hab._ Interior of West Coast of Africa, from Liberia to Sierra\r\n   Leone.\r\n\r\nThe flat skins of this Antelope, so remarkable for their transverse\r\nblack bands, first attracted the attention of naturalists in 1832, when\r\nthey were brought before the Committee of Science and Correspondence\r\nof the Zoological Society of London by Mr. E. T. Bennett, then\r\nSecretary of the Society. Mr. Bennett considered them as belonging\r\n“not improbably” to some species of Antelope, to which, however, he\r\ndid not venture to give a name. They were supposed by Gould (then the\r\nZoological Society’s taxidermist), who had obtained them, to have been\r\nreceived from Algoa Bay; but there is no doubt that this was an error,\r\nand that these flat skins, some of which are even now occasionally\r\nbrought to this country, are from Sierra Leone and the adjoining\r\ndistricts of Western Africa.\r\n\r\nFor some years this subject appears to have slept, but was revived\r\nin 1836 by Mr. Ogilby, who, in the course of some remarks upon the\r\npreserved specimens of Antelopes in the Zoological Society’s Museum,\r\ntook the opportunity of assuring his hearers that the skins described\r\nby Mr. Bennett belonged to a “real Antelope” and that he hoped shortly\r\nto “have an opportunity of describing it in detail under the name of\r\n_Antelope doria_.”\r\n\r\nSome two years later the late Dr. Gray proposed the name “_Antilope\r\nzebra_” for the same animal, based upon a skin received by the\r\nBritish Museum from Sierra Leone. Gray recognized it as being evidently\r\nthe same as that previously described by Bennett, and gave no reason\r\nfor proposing to alter its name.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time similar imperfect flat skins attracted the\r\nattention of M. Robert, of Paris, who shortly described them in a\r\ncommunication to the ‘Echo du Monde Savant’ of 1836 under the name\r\n_Antilope zebrata_. But there is no doubt, we think, that\r\n“_doria_” was the first published specific appellation of this\r\nAntelope, and ought to be adopted. “Doria” is stated by Gray (Cat. Ung.\r\np. 129) to have been the Christian name of Mr. Ogilby’s wife.\r\n\r\nIn his ‘List of Specimens of Mammals in the British Museum,’ published\r\nin 1843, Gray assigned this species to the genus _Cephalophorus_,\r\ni.e. _Cephalophus_. In his subsequent Catalogues he transferred it\r\nto the genus _Damalis_ (i.e. _Damaliscus_),“on account of the\r\ndark mark on the outside of the limb.”\r\n\r\nFrom the flat skins in the British Museum and the Zoological Society’s\r\ncollection, Fraser, in 1849, gave a partly imaginative figure of this\r\nAntelope in his ‘Zoologia Typica.’\r\n\r\nIt was more than 50 years after the imperfect description of this\r\nproblematical Antelope from the flat skins before science obtained\r\ncorrect information as to its proper characters and position in the\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nDuring the celebrated expedition of the naturalists of the Leyden\r\nMuseum to Liberia in 1879 and following years Mr. Büttikofer first\r\nobtained perfect specimens of this Duiker on the St. Paul’s River.\r\nThese were described by Dr. Jentink in the seventh volume of the\r\n‘Notes from the Leyden Museum’ in 1885, and a figure was given of the\r\nskull. In the succeeding volume of the ‘Notes’ Dr. Jentink gave fuller\r\nparticulars respecting this welcome rediscovery, and informed us that,\r\nas shown by the series of specimens collected by Mr. Büttikofer and his\r\nfellow travellers, this Antelope is not uncommon in certain parts of\r\nLiberia. The “Mountain-deer,” as the Americanized Liberians call it,\r\ndoes not occur in the coast-district, but is found in the mountainous\r\nterrain of the interior. Dr. Jentink gave coloured illustrations\r\nof the male, female, and young of this Antelope, together with\r\nrepresentations of the skull of the adult male, the skull figured in\r\nthe previous volume having been that of a female.\r\n\r\nIn the second volume of his ‘Reisebilder aus Liberia,’ published in\r\n1890, Mr. Büttikofer tells us that he first saw a living example of\r\nthis species in the forest near Soforeh Place, and recognized it, with\r\nmuch delight, as the “Mountain-deer” of which he had heard so much\r\nspoken. Here he captured a young one alive, and subsequently found\r\nthe skull of the mother, which was wounded but not obtained on that\r\noccasion. In his second expedition to Liberia, Mr. Büttikofer and\r\nhis companions procured a full series of examples of this beautiful\r\nspecies. Mr. Büttikofer remarks that the weight of a full-grown\r\nexample of this animal ranges from 40 to 50 lbs., and that a specially\r\nremarkable development in its structure is that of the hairs on the\r\nhind edge of the tarsus, which form a sort of brush.\r\n\r\nOur figure of this Antelope (Plate XX.) has been prepared by Mr. Smit\r\nfrom a stuffed specimen of an adult male in the British Museum obtained\r\non the Du Queah River in Liberia during Mr. Büttikofer’s second\r\nexpedition. In the same collection there is a skin of an adult female\r\nfrom the same locality, and the skeletons of both these animals. The\r\nflat skins which were the types of the specific terms “_doria_”\r\nof Ogilby and “_zebra_” of Gray are likewise in the National\r\nCollection.\r\n\r\n    _August, 1895._\r\n\r\n\r\n                         31.

Colour of body uniform dark smoky brown or black, becoming\r\ndarker on the rump and limbs; paler on the throat and chest. Face\r\nfulvous, darkening into rich rufous on the crest; the centre of the\r\nforehead sometimes brown or black. Ears black haired externally, rufous\r\ninternally. Tail black above, but with a whitish terminal tuft.\r\n\r\nSkull long and narrow. Forehead swollen; anteorbital fossæ rather\r\nshallow; mesial notch of palate about ¼ inch in advance of lateral ones.\r\n\r\nHorns, in male, “straight, rough at their base, smooth and pointed at\r\ntheir extremity, 3–3½ inches in length” (_Temminck_, _l.c._):\r\nin female short, barely an inch in length, blunt and rounded, not\r\nexpanded basally.\r\n\r\nDimensions:--(♂). Approximate height at withers 18 inches, length of\r\nhind foot 8·3, of ear 2·8.\r\n\r\nSkull (♀): basal length (c.) 6·8, greatest breadth 3·3, anterior edge\r\nof orbit to muzzle 4·2.\r\n\r\n   _Hab._ West Coast of Africa, from Liberia to the Gold Coast.\r\n\r\nThe well-known field-naturalist Pel, one of the many excellent\r\ncollectors employed from time to time by the Leyden Museum, was the\r\ndiscoverer of this Duiker, of which he transmitted specimens home\r\nfrom the Guinea coast about the year 1843. Shortly afterwards the\r\nBritish Museum acquired one of Pel’s specimens from Leyden under the\r\nMS. name “_Antilope niger_.” This was described by Gray in 1846\r\nas the type of a new species, “The Black Bush-buck (_Cephalophus\r\nniger_).” Gray added to his description that there was then living\r\nin the Knowsley Menagerie a “Bush-buck” which was probably of the same\r\nspecies; and on turning to the pictures in the ‘Gleanings from the\r\nDerby Menagerie’ we find what is doubtless the animal referred to,\r\nfigured upon a plate (vii. fig. 2) which is initialed by Waterhouse\r\nHawkins as having been drawn in 1846. So far as we know, this is the\r\nonly individual of this Antelope that has ever been brought to Europe\r\nalive.\r\n\r\nAlthough Gray had taken the name which he received with this animal\r\nfrom the Leyden Museum and had employed it throughout in his\r\ncatalogues, Temminck, the then Director of that great establishment,\r\nwhen he published his ‘Esquisses Zoologiques sur la Côte de Guiné’ in\r\n1855, was not content to adopt it. He considered it “too vague,” as\r\nhaving been already applied to other species of Antelopes, and proposed\r\nto change it to _Cephalophus pluto_. Temminck informs us that this\r\nspecies is widely distributed on the coast of Guinea and is very common\r\nin the forests near the Dutch factories in that district, particularly\r\nin Ashantee, near Chama and Dabacrom.\r\n\r\nIn the adjoining republic of Liberia, to the west of the Gold Coast,\r\nMr. Büttikofer and his colleagues Sala and Stampfli obtained many\r\nspecimens of this Duiker during their expeditions of 1879 and 1886.\r\nDr. Jentink, in cataloguing their results, gives various localities in\r\nwhich it was met with--viz. at St. Paul’s River, Schieffelinsville,\r\nJunk River, Du Queah River, and Farmington River. The Liberian\r\nnaturalists remark that the flesh of this Antelope has a remarkably\r\nstrong bitter flavour, which they never observed in any other species\r\nof the group. This peculiarity is probably caused by some special food\r\nto which it is addicted.\r\n\r\nIn his ‘Reisebilder aus Liberia’ Mr. Büttikofer informs us that the\r\nBlack Duiker, known to the Liberians under the name of the Bush-Goat,\r\nis one of the commonest species of the group in that republic. Like all\r\nother members of the genus, it is exclusively an inhabitant of the high\r\nforests and bushy woods, coming out at night into the savannahs and\r\nplantations to get its food. Mr. Büttikofer repeats his statements as\r\nregards the unsavoury character of its flesh, and states that even the\r\nnatives, who are by no means particular, in many cases refuse to eat it.\r\n\r\nBesides the immature female obtained by Pel, which forms the type of\r\n_Cephalophus niger_, the National Collection possesses skins of\r\nan adult female from Fantee and of a young individual from the Ankober\r\nRiver in Ashantee, both obtained by the native collector Aubinn.\r\n\r\nOur coloured figure of the Black Duiker (Plate XIV. fig. 1) was\r\nprepared by Mr. Smit under the direction of the late Sir Victor Brooke.\r\nIt was probably taken from the mounted specimen in the British Museum,\r\nbut of this we have no certain record.\r\n\r\n    _August, 1895._\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    THE BOOK OF ANTELOPES, PL.

Colour uniform\r\nslaty brown, becoming paler below and on the inner sides of the limbs.\r\nSuperciliary streaks whitish. Ears small, rounded, behind dark brown.\r\nRump and backs of the hams uniform with body, except that just at the\r\nbase of the tail on each side, and on the top of the proximal half of\r\nthe tail itself, the colour is rather darker. Rest of tail above brown,\r\nbeneath whitish; limbs externally like body.\r\n\r\nHorns set up at a slight angle above the nasal profile, but not nearly\r\nso much as in _C. grimmi_: those of male short (about 2 inches\r\nlong), thick at base; their greatest basal diameter going about 2½\r\ntimes in their length; of female, according to Temminck, exceedingly\r\nsmall, and indeed they are entirely absent in the only specimen\r\navailable to us, but this is not fully adult.\r\n\r\nSkull broad and strong. Muzzle rather narrow. Anteorbital fossæ rather\r\nshallow. Mesial notch of palate only about ⅙ inch in advance of the\r\nlateral ones.\r\n\r\nDimensions:--♀. Height at withers 14 inches, ear 2, hind foot 6·7.\r\n\r\nSkull (♂): basal length 4·7 inches, greatest breadth 2·5, anterior edge\r\nof orbit to muzzle 2·7.\r\n\r\nThis species shows a certain tendency to the peculiar coloration of\r\nthe rump characteristic of _C. melanorheus_; the colour-contrasts\r\nof black and white of the latter, however, are in this case only dark\r\nbrown and light brown respectively.\r\n\r\n   _Hab._ Coast of West Africa from Gambia to the Gold Coast.\r\n\r\nThis Duiker, which is of considerably smaller dimensions than the\r\ntwo previous species, and of a nearly uniform slaty-brown colour,\r\nis likewise a West-African species, but seems to have a rather more\r\nextended range along the coast. Whether it is really the Guévei of A\r\ndamson and Buffon is, to say the least of it, very doubtful, but it is\r\nprobably the species figured under that name by F. Cuvier in 1826 from\r\na specimen from Senegal then living in the Jardin des Plantes. Cuvier\r\nreferred this specimen to the _Antilope pygmæa_ of former authors,\r\nbut, as we know from Sir Victor Brooke’s excellent article on this\r\nsubject (P. Z. S. 1872, p. 637), that specific name properly belongs to\r\nthe Royal Antelope of Western Africa, of which we shall give an account\r\nin a subsequent part of this work.\r\n\r\nIn 1827, in his volume on the order Ruminantia in ‘Griffith’s Animal\r\nKingdom,’ Major Hamilton Smith described a female of this species\r\nwhich had been brought home from Sierra Leone by Col. Charles Maxwell\r\nand dedicated it to that gentleman as _Antilope maxwelli_. In\r\na subsequent volume of the same work, containing a synopsis of the\r\nspecies of mammals, Hamilton Smith not only repeated the description,\r\nbut added, as apparently different, a description of another young\r\nspecimen from the same country, and classed it as a different species\r\nunder the name _Antilope philantomba_. Under this last designation\r\nalso this Antelope is mentioned by Ogilby in the ‘Proceedings’ of the\r\nZoological Society for 1836, where he gives some particulars respecting\r\ntwo females which had lived for some time in the Society’s Gardens.\r\n\r\nAt about this date also there were several examples of the\r\n“_Philantomba_” as it is commonly called in Zoological Gardens,\r\nliving in the Derby Menagerie at Knowsley. In Waterhouse Hawkins’s\r\ndrawings of the animals in this splendid collection, which were\r\nsubsequently edited by Gray, Maxwell’s Duiker appears to have been\r\nmentioned under three different names--first as _C. maxwelli_\r\n(plate xi. _a_), secondly as _C. punctulatus_ (p. 11), and\r\nthirdly as _C. whitfieldi_ (plate xi. fig. 2). So far as we can\r\ntell all these names must refer to the present species, which seems to\r\nvary considerably between youth and age.\r\n\r\nMany living specimens of this Duiker have also been received by the\r\nZoological Society of London, besides those mentioned by Mr. Ogilby.\r\nAlthough in nature shy and retiring it does well in captivity, and\r\nbecomes very tame when petted. It has frequently bred in the Society’s\r\nMenagerie, and specimens are registered as having been born there in\r\n1867, 1871, 1872, 1873, and 1874. It is also well known in several of\r\nthe Zoological Gardens on the Continent. Of late years there have been\r\nmany examples of this little Antelope in the Zoological Gardens at\r\nAmsterdam, and there are at present two males in that Collection.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 20.\r\n\r\n  Skull of _Cephalophus maxwelli_.\r\n\r\n  (P. Z. S. 1871, p. 600.)]\r\n\r\nIt has been stated by some authors that the female of this species is\r\nhornless, but of those in the Zoological Society’s Collection it is\r\ncertain that both males and females have carried horns, though these\r\nappendages are usually rather smaller in the latter sex. As regards\r\nthe specimens in the Zoological Gardens at Amsterdam, Mr. F. E. Blaauw\r\nlikewise assures us that all the females have had horns, sometimes\r\nlarger and sometimes smaller. We therefore regard the absence of horns\r\nin adult females of this species as an exceptional occurrence.\r\n\r\nMaxwell’s Duiker appears to extend from Senegal and Gambia all along\r\nthe West Coast of Africa to the mouths of the Niger. From Senegal,\r\nas already mentioned, it has been received in Paris, and from the\r\nGambia living specimens were brought by Whitfield for the Derby\r\nMenagerie. From Sierra Leone there is a specimen in the British Museum\r\npresented by Colonel Sabine, R.E., which is the type of _Cephalophus\r\npunctulatus_. In Liberia, Mr. Büttikofer tells us, Maxwell’s\r\nDuiker is unquestionably the commonest species. It is known to the\r\nLiberians under the name of “_Fulintongue_,” of which no doubt\r\n“_Philantomba_” is a corruption. Mr. Büttikofer tells us that it\r\nlives in small troops in the bush, but is very shy and difficult for\r\nthe hunter to approach, so that it is generally captured in snares.\r\nProceeding farther westwards we find that specimens of this Antelope\r\nhave been transmitted to the Leyden Museum from Dabacrom, on the Gold\r\nCoast, by Pel, and to the British Museum from Fantee by the native\r\ncollector Aubinn. As we are kindly informed by Herr Matschie, there are\r\nexamples of this species in the Berlin Museum collected in Togo-land by\r\nHerr Baumann.\r\n\r\nOur figure of this Antelope (Plate XXI. fig. 2) was prepared by Mr.\r\nSmit many years ago under the directions of Sir Victor Brooke. It was\r\nprobably taken from one of the specimens in the British Museum, but we\r\nhave unfortunately no certain knowledge on this subject\r\n\r\n    _August, 1895._\r\n\r\n\r\n                     33.

Female with horns.\r\n\r\nHorns short, but almost as long in the female as in the male, placed in\r\nthe same straight line as the nasal profile, slightly incurved: those\r\nof male about 1½ inch long, their basal diameter going about 2½ times\r\nin the length; those of female about 1¼ inch long, basal diameter\r\ngoing about 3 times in the length.\r\n\r\nDimensions:--Height much as in _C. monticola_, length of ear 1·6\r\ninch, hind foot 6·1.\r\n\r\nSkull (♂): basal length (c.) 4·6 inches, greatest breadth 2·4, anterior\r\nedge of orbit to muzzle 2·5.\r\n\r\n   _Hab._ Africa south and east of the Niger, extending from the\r\n   Cameroons to Angola and eastwards to the coast opposite Zanzibar.\r\n\r\nTo the east and south of the Niger Delta, Maxwell’s Duiker appears to\r\nbe represented by the present species, which, as we have explained\r\nabove, is of the same size and closely resembles it in most particulars.\r\n\r\nThe Black-rumped Duiker was first described by Gray in an article\r\non new species of this group, published in the ‘Annals and Magazine\r\nof Natural History’ for 1846, from specimens in the British Museum,\r\ntransmitted from Fernando Po by James Thompson, one of Lord Derby’s\r\ncollectors. Shortly afterwards it was figured in the ‘Knowsley\r\nMenagerie ’ by Waterhouse Hawkins from living specimens brought home by\r\nthe same traveller.\r\n\r\nWe will now endeavour to give some idea of the range of this still\r\nimperfectly-known species. Beginning on the north, we find skins of\r\nit in the British Museum obtained in the wooded district of Cameroons\r\nand transmitted to the British Museum by the late Captain Burton and\r\nby Crossley, besides the typical specimens received from Fernando Po,\r\nwhich were probably originally obtained from the adjoining mainland.\r\nHerr Matschie, in an article on the Mammals of the Cameroons, published\r\nin 1891, likewise records the occurrence of this species in the Wuté\r\ndistrict of that country, as testified by a skull sent to Berlin by\r\nLieut. Morgen. From Gaboon there is a skin of an adult male in the\r\nBritish Museum, obtained by Mr. DuChaillu, and a specimen in the Berlin\r\nMuseum procured by Buchholtz. To the south of the Congo this Duiker\r\nhas been obtained at Capangombé in Angola by the well-known Portuguese\r\ncollector Anchieta. M. de Bocage in 1878 based a new species on these\r\nspecimens and proposed to dedicate it to M. d’Anchieta, having been\r\nmisled by the indifferent figure and imperfect description of _C.\r\nmelanorheus_ given in the ‘Knowsley Menagerie.’ But there appears\r\nto be no reasonable doubt that they may be properly referred to _C.\r\nmelanorheus_.\r\n\r\nHow far the Black-rumped Duiker extends over the forests of the Congo\r\nbasin is, as yet, quite uncertain. The authorities of the Congo Free\r\nState have, up to the present time, persistently neglected to obtain\r\nany accurate information of the zoology of the great region which they\r\nhave occupied. The little we know of the animals of this wide area\r\nis based upon fragmentary specimens obtained by passing explorers.\r\nIt is very probable, however, that _C. melanorheus_ may range\r\nover nearly the whole of the great woody basin of the Congo and its\r\ntributaries. But when we come to the eastern slope of Africa, from\r\nvarious parts of which specimens referred to this species have been\r\nreceived, we meet, as Sundevall has pointed out, with a slightly\r\ndifferent form, which for the present it is proposed to regard as\r\na subspecies (following Fitzinger) as _Cephalophus melanorheus\r\nsundevalli_.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that, as regards these small Duikers, a far better series\r\nfrom the various points of their range must be rendered accessible\r\nbefore we can come to any accurate determination as to their systematic\r\narrangement and distribution. Herr Matschie informs us that some\r\nspecimens received in Berlin from Dar-es-Salaam, in German East Africa,\r\nrather more resemble _C. monticola_ than _C. melanorheus_; so\r\nhere is another riddle yet unsolved.\r\n\r\n    _August, 1895._\r\n\r\n\r\n                        34.

Neumann_).\r\n\r\nSimilar to _C. melanorheus_ in almost all respects, but the under\r\nsurface only little lighter than the upper, and the female, at least in\r\nall the three specimens known, entirely without horns.\r\n\r\nDimensions (from Matschie):--“Height at shoulder 10–12 inches, height\r\non rump 12–13.”\r\n\r\nSkull (♀): basal length 4·14 inches, greatest breadth 2·16, muzzle to\r\norbit 2·34.\r\n\r\nHorns of a male 1¼ inch long, half an inch thick at the base\r\n(_Matschie_).\r\n\r\n   _Hab._ Uganda.\r\n\r\nThe representative of the Black-rumped Duiker in Uganda has recently\r\nbeen separated by Herr Matschie from _C. melanorheus_ under the\r\nname of _C. æguatorialis_ on account of its darker belly, which\r\nis stated to be of a bright isabella-brown colour, “nearly of the tint\r\nwhich Mr. Ridgway, in his ‘Nomenclature of Colours’ (tab. iii. no. 21),\r\ncalls écru drab, and scarcely lighter in colour than the back.” The\r\nspecies was based upon five specimens obtained by Stuhlmann in Chagwè,\r\nUganda, in the month of December. Dr. Stuhlmann’s note is that this\r\nAntelope lives in the forests of Uganda, and that its skins are brought\r\nin numbers to the market at Mengo. A living example of this species, we\r\nare informed by Herr Matschie, was in 1892 in the Zoological Garden of\r\nBerlin.\r\n\r\nOn examining two skins of adult females of what we suppose to be\r\nthe same Antelope, obtained by Capt. W. H. Williams in Uganda, and\r\npresented to the British Museum in April 1893, we do not find the\r\ncharacter, assumed by Herr Matschie as distinctive of the species,\r\nto be quite constant. The bellies of the two specimens just referred\r\nto are scarcely darker than in West-African specimens of _C.\r\nmelanorheus_. Moreover, two examples of the latter species from\r\nCameroons, collected together, differ markedly in the coloration of\r\ntheir bellies. We should therefore not have been inclined to admit\r\n_C. æquatorialis_ as a distinct species were it not for the\r\nfact that the perfect skull of one of the specimens in the British\r\nMuseum shows no traces of horns. This is also stated to be the case\r\nin two female specimens in the Berlin Museum upon which Herr Matschie\r\nestablished the species. In _C. melanorheus_, as already stated,\r\nthe horns are always present in both sexes. Under these circumstances\r\nit is better to keep _C. æquatorialis_, provisionally at least, as\r\ndistinct, until further information is obtained.\r\n\r\nMr. Scott Elliot during his recent adventurous journey to Mount\r\nRuwenzori obtained a single specimen (now in the British Museum) of\r\nthis Duiker in Uganda, and has favoured us with the following note upon\r\nit:--\r\n\r\n“The _Cephalophus_ of which I brought home the skin was obtained\r\nfrom some natives at Kampala, Uganda, in February 1894. It was a\r\nfemale. I believe it was found on the highlands bordering Lake Victoria\r\nNyanza, at an elevation of from 3900 to 4100 feet.”\r\n\r\n    _August, 1895._\r\n\r\n\r\n                         35.

Thunberg was a distinguished naturalist and traveller\r\nof the last century, and a favourite disciple of Linnæus. During his\r\ntravels to the Cape, Ceylon, Java, and Japan he amassed a rich harvest\r\nof plants and animals, which were described in the narrative of his\r\njourney, and in the memoirs of various scientific societies.\r\n\r\nAnother term used by many authors for this Antelope is _pygmæa_. But\r\nthe true _Copra pygmæa_ of Linnæus, as has been shown by the late\r\nSir Victor Brooke, refers to a different Antelope--the little Royal\r\nAntelope of West Africa. The remaining terms, such as _cærulea_,\r\n_perpusilla_, and _minuta_, which have been applied to this species,\r\nare all ante-dated by Thunberg’s term _monticola_.\r\n\r\nThe Blue-buck, Messrs. Nicolls and Eglington tell us, is now found only\r\nin the coast districts of the Cape Colony, and occasionally in Natal,\r\nbeing nowhere plentiful. It is solitary in its habits and keeps to the\r\ndense bush and forest, from which it is with difficulty dislodged. When\r\npursued by dogs it darts across from cover to cover with surprising\r\ncelerity. These authors add that this Antelope emits a nasty musky\r\nodour and that its flesh is not particularly good.\r\n\r\nHow far the Blue Duiker extends beyond the limits of the Cape Colony\r\nis, as yet, a matter of considerable uncertainty, these small Duikers,\r\nowing to their close similarity, being still in a state of much\r\nconfusion. According to M. Du Bocage, as recorded in the Zoological\r\nSociety’s ‘Proceedings’ for 1878, this species is found in Benguela\r\nand Loando, far up the west coast. On the east coast Peters obtained\r\nspecimens near Mozambique, Quillemane, and Inambane, and in Boror,\r\nwhich, in his ‘Reise nach Mossambique,’ he refers to the present\r\nspecies. 1\r\n\r\nNorth of the Zambesi in Nyasaland either the Blue Duiker or a closely\r\nallied species is found, of which Mr. Crawshay speaks as follows:--\r\n\r\n“This little Antelope, or at any rate a species of Blue-buck very\r\nclosely resembling it, appears to be common in parts of the Nyasa\r\ncountry, especially in the densely wooded slopes of mountains; and\r\nthough I cannot claim to have come across any in life, I have yet seen\r\na good number of their skins--notably among the Anyika of Chombi and\r\nthe adjoining mountains, where they are said to be plentiful. On the\r\nthickly wooded mountainous slopes between Bandawe and Syiska they are\r\nalso said to exist, and again in some of the hills about Cape Maclear;\r\nbut everywhere natives speak of them as being shy and very difficult to\r\nbring to bag in the thick covert where they are generally found.”\r\n\r\nIn 1862 the late Dr. Gray described and figured in the Zoological\r\nSociety’s ‘Proceedings,’ under the name of _Cephalophus bicolor_,\r\nwhat appears to be merely a piebald variety of the present species.\r\nThe specimen was obtained by Mr. John Dunn in the Ungozy Forest\r\nof Zululand. It is in the British Museum. There are also in the\r\nNational Collection specimens of this Antelope obtained by Burchell at\r\nGalgebosch, near Uitenhage, in the Cape Colony.\r\n\r\nMany specimens of the “Blau-bok,” as it is called in the Zoological\r\nSociety’s Catalogues, have been captured and brought alive to this\r\ncountry and exhibited in the Society’s Gardens. A male was presented\r\nby Sir George Grey, then Governor of the Cape, in 1861, and another by\r\nH.R.H. the Duke of Edinburgh in 1866. Other specimens of both sexes\r\nwere received in 1871, 1874, 1882, and subsequent years. In every case,\r\nas we are informed by the Head Keeper and Superintendent, the females\r\ncarried horns as well as the males.\r\n\r\nOur figure of this species (Plate XXI. fig. 1) was drawn by Mr. Smit\r\nunder the superintendence of the late Sir Victor Brooke. We can find no\r\nrecord of from what specimen it was taken.\r\n\r\n    _August, 1895._\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    THE BOOK OF ANTELOPES, PL. XXII.\r\n\r\n    _Wolf del.

The typical specimen in the British Museum appears to be\r\nimmature, as are likewise other examples obtained in its company, and\r\nperfectly adult specimens of this obscure species are much required.\r\nAlong with the skins Whitfield brought home a single adult female\r\nfor the Derby Menagerie. This was figured in 1842 in two positions by\r\nWaterhouse Hawkins on the sixth plate of the ‘Gleanings.’ In the text\r\nof the ‘Knowsley Menagerie’ we are told that Whitfield’s name for it\r\nwas the “Coquetoon,” but in the plate the native name of the present\r\nspecies is given as “Sinani,” while that of “Coquetoon” is assigned to\r\n_C. rufilatus_ figured in its company, and this vernacular name\r\nhas certainly been more generally applied to the latter species.\r\n\r\nWe suppose that the Antelope described by Pallas as _Antilope\r\ngrimmia_ from living specimens brought from the Guinea Coast may\r\nprobably have belonged to this species, as may also many references of\r\nthe older authors to an _Antilope grimmia_ from Western Africa.\r\nBut the true _Capra grimmia_ of Linnæus, as we shall presently\r\nshow, refers to another species.\r\n\r\nWe cannot find that any modern authority refers to fresh examples of\r\nthis Antelope, and from the immaturity of the available specimens, to\r\nwhich we have already referred, we are quite unable to come to any\r\ndefinite conclusion as to its relationship. In its general appearance,\r\nhowever, the Crowned Duiker has a certain amount of resemblance to\r\n_C. abyssinicus_ and _C. grimmi_, and we therefore place it\r\nprovisionally in its present position.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying figure (Plate XXII. fig. 2), probably representing the\r\nmale of this species, was drawn by Mr. Smit for the late Sir Victor\r\nBrooke, but we are unable to say from what specimen it was prepared.\r\n\r\n    _August, 1895._\r\n\r\n\r\n                      37.

Colour grizzled yellowish grey, with rufous face, brown\r\nnasal mark, and brown feet, just as in the grizzled varieties of _C.\r\ngrimmi_, of which it is obviously the Abyssinian representative.\r\n\r\nHorns (♂) set up at an angle above the line of the nasal profile, but\r\nnot so markedly as in _C. grimmi_, 3 inches long, evenly tapering,\r\ntheir basal diameter going nearly 5 times in their length.\r\n\r\nSkull, besides being actually smaller, shorter and broader in\r\nproportion than in _C. grimmi_. Distance between orbit and muzzle\r\nonly just about equal to the zygomatic breadth. Anteorbital fossæ of\r\nmedium depth.

It therefore became\r\nnecessary to change the name, and Thomas proposed to call the present\r\nspecies _Cephalophus abyssinicus_.\r\n\r\nIn his ‘Neue Wirbelthiere,’ after a careful description of this\r\nAntelope, Rüppell tells us that it is only found in the mountainous\r\nprovinces of Abyssinia, where the vegetation consists principally of\r\nbush, and in such parts of them as rise from five to eight thousand\r\nfeet above the sea-level. Rüppell met with it first at Galla on the\r\nmountain-chain west of Massowa. Afterwards he found it common on the\r\nmountains and valleys of the “Kulla,” where it is always met with in\r\npairs and is difficult to shoot on account of its traversing the bush\r\nso quickly. Its Abyssinian native name, Rüppell tells us, is “Madoqua,”\r\nwhich, however, as already stated, has likewise been applied to another\r\nspecies--Salt’s Antelope.\r\n\r\nThe only more recent traveller, so far as we know, that has met with\r\nthe Abyssinian Duiker in its native wilds is Dr. W. T. Blanford,\r\nF.R.S., who accompanied, as Naturalist, the British Abyssinian\r\nExpedition from Massowa to Magdala in 1867–68 and subsequently\r\npublished an excellent volume containing the results of his\r\nobservations on the geology and zoology of that country. Dr. Blanford\r\ntells us that this Bush-Antelope is not rare on the highlands of\r\nAbyssinia at elevations of from 7000 to 8000 feet. He usually saw\r\nit solitary in the bushes and small clearings and obtained two\r\nbucks, one at Dildi, the other at Dongolo, of which he gives us the\r\ndimensions. These specimens (as is recorded by Mr. W. L. Sclater in his\r\n‘Catalogue’) are now in the India Museum, Calcutta.\r\n\r\nThe British Museum contains a single adult male specimen of this\r\nspecies mounted (together with its skull), upon which Thomas based the\r\nname _abyssinicus_.\r\n\r\nOur figure of this species (Plate XXII. fig. 1) was prepared by Mr.\r\nSmit under the directions of the late Sir Victor Brooke, but from what\r\nspecimen we are unable to say.\r\n\r\n    _August, 1895._\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    THE BOOK OF ANTELOPES, PL.

Described by Grimm in\r\n1686 as the _Capra sylvestris africana_ it was dedicated to that\r\nnaturalist by Linnæus, when he adopted the binomial system, as the\r\n_Capra_ or _Moschus grimmia_. This term, slightly modified\r\nin accordance with modern usage, we propose to adopt as its specific\r\nname. Other early names bestowed upon it were _Antilope nictitans_\r\nby Thunberg, of whose travels to the Cape we have already spoken, and\r\n_Antilope mergens_ by Blainville, while various appellations,\r\nwhich are specified in our synonymy, were given to this species and its\r\nvarieties by Andrew Smith, Hamilton Smith, Gray, and Fitzinger.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 22.\r\n\r\n  Skull of _Cephalophus grimmi_.\r\n\r\n  (P.Z.S. 1871, p. 591.)]\r\n\r\nIn his important work on the ‘Game and Wild Animals of Southern\r\nAfrica,’ as they existed in 1836 and 1837, Cornwallis Harris figures\r\nthe “Duiker” as a companion of the Pallah and speaks of it as common\r\nthroughout the Cape Colony, especially towards the sea-coast, among\r\nthe bushes and brush-wood. This experienced observer states that\r\nevery female specimen of the Duiker that he had seen possessed short\r\nhorns, nearly, if not totally obscured by the tuft on the head; this,\r\nwe shall see, is contrary to the observations of some other writers.\r\nFrom the text of Harris’s volume we extract his lively account of\r\nthe Duiker and its habits:--“The smaller Antelope, delineated in the\r\nannexed plate, is a denizen of the same _locale_ as the Pallah;\r\nand although claiming from its diminutive stature an extremely limited\r\nportion of attention, was yet never neglected when accident placed it\r\nin our way. The pair which furnished the originals of this portrait\r\nwere on my own shoulders borne three miles to the waggons from one of\r\nthe central steppes of the Cashan mountains, whither, having gone out\r\nalone, I killed the buck as he sat on a projecting ledge--knocking over\r\nhis disconsolate relict with the second barrel as she stood gazing in\r\nmute amazement at her mate’s death-struggles. The pasterns of this\r\nrobust and sturdy little animal, which are singularly rigid, have the\r\nappearance of being encased in Blucher’s, or ancle boots; two other\r\nof its most remarkable features being the long suborbital slit that\r\ntraverses the whole length of its Roman features, and the pencilled\r\n_toupet_ of bright fulvous hair arising from the forehead, neither\r\nof which occur in any other Antelopes. Writers have noticed three\r\ndistinct species of the Duiker, but the peculiarities in the horns\r\nthat have led to this division are so trivial that I should rather\r\nfeel disposed to place them to the score of age, disease, or accident,\r\nfew specimens being exactly alike. The animal is extremely common\r\nin many parts of the Cape Colony, and on the outskirts of the deep\r\nforests which border the sea-coast especially. Here on my return from\r\nthe interior, I killed several--and found it even more abundant than\r\nbeyond the boundary. Occurring either singly or in pairs, the little\r\ndwarf is usually found crouching amid the shelter of bushy localities,\r\nand the dexterity with which it seeks to foil its pursuers among the\r\nintricacies of these, has gained for it the Dutch soubriquet in which\r\nit rejoices. Aroused from its snug form, the ‘Artful Dodger’ clears\r\nwith one vigorous and elastic bound the nearest bush, and diving low on\r\nthe other side among the heather and brushwood, continues alternately\r\nleaping and plunging whilst it flies straight as a dart to the nearest\r\nthicket--before seeking an asylum in which, and not unfrequently also\r\nduring its retreat, it rises like the hare upon its hinder legs, and\r\nhaving thus reconnoitred the foe above the intervening vegetation,\r\nwheels with an impatient sneeze to the right about, and proceeds\r\nducking and bounding as before.\r\n\r\n“The approved Colonial mode of hunting the Duiker-bok is with dogs--and\r\nwhilst thus topping the covert, or darting from one copse to another,\r\nthe little wretch, despite of all its dodging and artifice, is easily\r\nslain with a hatful of buckshot discharged from a piece of ordnance\r\nof such calibre, that four fingers might be introduced without much\r\nsqueezing! Like the rest of the Cape venison, the flesh is utterly\r\ndestitute of fat, a deficiency which the thrifty Dutch housewife seeks\r\nto remedy with her usual skill by calling in the aid of a sheep’s tail.\r\nThe animal is often to be seen running tame about the farm-houses,\r\nbut it never ceases, even in a domestic state, to take the note of\r\nalarm from the least sound to which it has been unaccustomed--thunder\r\ninvariably causing it to fly to the nearest shelter in order to hide\r\nitself away.”\r\n\r\nAs regards the Duiker in the Cape Colony at the present time, we are\r\nassured by Messrs. Nicolls and Eglington that it is still, next to\r\nthe Steinbuck, the most common and widely distributed of the smaller\r\nAntelopes, being found sometimes in pairs, but more frequently singly\r\nin every suitable locality from Table Bay to the Zambezi. As a rule,\r\nthese observers tell us, the Duikers of Cape Colony and Griqualand\r\nWest are smaller and lighter in colour than those found further north.\r\nIn certain portions of the Kalihari Desert they are very common, and\r\nattain their largest size, some specimens obtained by these gentlemen\r\nhaving measured 28 inches at the shoulder.\r\n\r\nThe Common Duiker no doubt extends far up the west coast of Africa.\r\nAlthough not mentioned by Andersson or Bains as occurring in\r\nDamaraland, it has been recorded by M. Du Bocage as having been\r\nobtained by Anchieta in Angola, and there are specimens in the British\r\nMuseum from the same country transmitted by Gabriel, upon which\r\nGray established his species _Grimmia splendidula_. But along\r\nthe eastern side of Africa the range of this little Antelope, or of\r\nslightly representative forms, which at present we are quite unable to\r\ndistinguish, is much more extensive. The Duiker is found throughout\r\nthe Transvaal, and the great hunter Mr. F. C. Selous informs us that\r\nduring his extensive journeyings north and south of the Zambezi,\r\nexcept in districts devoid of bush or covered by steep rocky hills,\r\nhe has always met with this Antelope. According to this experienced\r\nobserver, individuals, though shot in the same district, vary much\r\nin colour, some skins being of a greenish tinge and others of a\r\nreddish brown, while specimens from the borders of the Kalihari have\r\nless white upon the belly than others. Contrary to Cornwallis Harris\r\nand other testimony, Mr. Selous states that the females are almost\r\nalways hornless, though he had met with three examples of this sex\r\nbearing horns. On the Zambezi and elsewhere in Mozambique Peters met\r\nwith specimens of this Antelope, which he described and figured in\r\nhis ‘Reise’ as new species under the names _Antilope altifrons_\r\nand _A. ocularis_. These names are now generally regarded as\r\nsynonymous with _Cephalophus grimmi_. A third name, without any\r\nmention of the other two, has recently been added from the same region\r\nby Dr. Lorenz, and this we are equally unable to recognize as valid.\r\n\r\nThroughout Nyasaland, as we are assured by Mr. R. Crawshay (P.Z.S.\r\n1890, p. 661) the Duiker is very generally met with, except on the\r\nbare open plains or in very steep rocky country. Like Mr. Selous, Mr.\r\nCrawshay notices the variation in colour of this Antelope, which ranges\r\nfrom a reddish brown, not unfrequently tinged with green, to almost a\r\ndark red, while in some specimens the belly is more conspicuous for\r\nwhiteness than in others.\r\n\r\nNorth of Nyasaland the Duiker appears to extend across German East\r\nAfrica into British East Africa, where it is well known to the\r\nsportsmen of the Kilimanjaro district. Mr. F. J. Jackson, in ‘Big Game\r\nShooting,’ tells us that it is found throughout British East Africa,\r\nand extends as far west as Kavirondo. Herr Oscar Neumann informs us\r\nthat he has obtained it in Uganda. At Taveta it frequents the low stony\r\nhills covered with long grass and short scrub. On the coast it is\r\nfound in open bush country and also in low scrub and grass. A skin in\r\nthe British Museum is stated to have been obtained as high up as 10,000\r\nfeet on Kilimanjaro. Until recently we have believed the northern range\r\nof the Duiker not to extend beyond British East Africa; but quite\r\nlately Mr. F. Gillett, who accompanied Dr. Donaldson Smith during the\r\nfirst part of his adventurous expedition through Somali-land towards\r\nLake Rudolph, has met with the Duiker on the confines of Galla-land.\r\nMr. Gillett has favoured us with the following notes on this species:--\r\n\r\n“I killed three specimens of this Antelope on November 1st and 2nd,\r\n1894; they consisted of a full-grown male and female and a young\r\nfemale. I only came across this species in a small area of country\r\nabout 20 miles long by 10 wide, at an elevation of about 7000 feet.\r\nI found them living singly. The country consisted of long grass\r\nwith clumps of bushes with plenty of water. It was not timid of\r\nman’s presence, because my men saw it quite close to the Abyssinian\r\nencampment, where during the day there were always crowds of people\r\nmoving about; besides which the country must have been densely\r\npopulated not many years ago, signs of extensive cultivation being\r\nvisible. But it hides away in the bushes, and when disturbed does\r\nnot usually wait to make your acquaintance. The Galla name for it\r\nis ‘_Kompee_.’ The horns of the male lay back on the skull and\r\nmeasured 4 in. in length by 2⅛ in circumference. The tips of the feet\r\nwere black for about 2 inches. The old female had a fœtus in her. The\r\nyoung female measured 26 in. from anus to tip of nose and 17 in. the\r\nheight at shoulder. A great number of them were seen in this place by\r\nDr. Smith and Mr. Dodson, though the three I shot were the only ones I\r\ncame across. One of my camelmen recognized it at once, saying he had\r\noften seen it in the Barterri country west of the Gadabursi country,\r\nwhere it is numerous and called Kodobo. It has not been killed there,\r\nto his knowledge, by any European. Harar, he said, was three days from\r\nthe Barterri country; but he has never heard of it there or anywhere\r\nbut in his own country, which he says is exactly similar to where I\r\nfound these. I killed them at a place called Sheik Mahomet in the Galla\r\ncountry: long. about 40° 28′ 0″, lat. about 7° 15′ 0″.”\r\n\r\nThe Common Duiker is not unfrequently brought alive to this country,\r\nand examples may be seen in most of the European Zoological Gardens.\r\nOn reference to our Zoological Society’s catalogue it will be found\r\nthat examples of the Duiker-bok were received in 1867, 1872, and\r\n1876. Since that period the register of the Society shows that as many\r\nas eleven examples have been received up to the end of last year.\r\nThese have been of both sexes, and, according to the testimony of the\r\nkeepers, most of, if not all, the females have carried short horns. But\r\nthe Duiker-bok does not thrive in captivity in this country, and most\r\nof the specimens acquired have been short-lived.\r\n\r\nOur two illustrations of the Common Duiker (Plate XXIII.) were prepared\r\nby Mr. Smit under the direction of the late Sir Victor Brooke. The\r\nlower figure represents the more uniformly-coloured and typical form;\r\nthe upper shows the variety which has been called _ocularis_ and\r\nis known by its more rufous head, whitish eye-stripe, and much paler\r\ninferior surface.\r\n\r\n    _August, 1895._\r\n\r\n\r\n                         GENUS II.

The Southern Indian names may be taken as\r\n   referring to subsp. _subquadricornutus_.\r\n\r\nHeight at withers about 25 inches. General colour dull rufous brown,\r\nwhitish below, the line of demarcation on both sides not sharply\r\ndefined. Muzzle, outer side of ears, and a line down the front of the\r\nlimbs blackish brown. Outer sides of fetlocks whitish.\r\n\r\nSkull and horns as described above (p. 213). Dimensions of an adult\r\nmale skull: basal length 6·5 inches, greatest breadth 3·2, muzzle to\r\norbit 3·65.\r\n\r\nHorns straight, or the posterior pair slightly curving forwards; the\r\nlatter are from two to three times the length of the anterior pair.\r\nMr. Blanford states that the anterior are usually from 1 to 1½ inch\r\nlong, while the posterior are from 3 to 4 inches; while the best head\r\nrecorded by Mr. R. Ward, from the collection of Sir E. Loder, has a\r\nfront horn of 2½, a back one 4⅜ inches.\r\n\r\nThe subspecies _T. q. subquadricornutus_ is similar in all\r\nrespects to the typical form, with the exception that the anterior\r\nhorns are either entirely absent, or are represented merely by small\r\nhorny knobs, which often fall off and leave a black callous patch.\r\n\r\n   _Hab._ Peninsula of India, south of the Himalayas (in suitable\r\n   localities).\r\n\r\nThe Four-horned Antelope, the single representative of the genus\r\n_Tetraceros_, is the only member of this subfamily of Antelopes\r\nfound in Asia, and in its present distribution is confined to India\r\nsouth of the Himalayas. This species was first named by the French\r\nzoologist De Blainville, in course of a memoir read before the Société\r\nPhilomathique of Paris in 1816. It was based upon a skull which he\r\nappears to have seen in London in the Museum of the Royal College of\r\nSurgeons. For several years little more was known of this animal, but\r\nin 1824 it was figured by Geoffroy St.-Hilaire and F. Cuvier in their\r\n‘Histoire Naturelle des Mammifères,’ from a drawing (accompanied by\r\nnotes) forwarded to them by Duvaucel, a well-known French naturalist\r\nwho was then in India. In the meantime Major-General Thomas Hardwicke,\r\na name well known in Indian zoology, who had become well acquainted\r\nwith the animal during his residence in India, had described it in a\r\nmemoir read before the Linnean Society in 1823. Owing to the delay\r\nin the publication of Hardwicke’s paper, which was printed in the\r\nfourteenth volume of the Linnaean Society’s ‘Transactions,’ the\r\ndescription and figure of this animal in the ‘Histoire Naturelle des\r\nMammifères’ appeared first, as is stated by Hardwicke in an addendum\r\nto his memoir. Hardwicke declared that Duvaucel’s figure and notes had\r\nbeen taken from a drawing which that naturalist saw in Hardwicke’s\r\npossession when he visited the Major-General at Dum-dum in 1822.\r\nHardwicke states that on that occasion Duvaucel also saw specimens of\r\nboth sexes of this animal, which were then alive in his possession, and\r\nsuggests that Duvaucel’s imperfect notes were also drawn up on this\r\noccasion. As this seems a very probable explanation of what took place,\r\nI think that we must allow that our countryman Hardwicke was the first\r\nto recognize this species, although it is unfortunate that he gave\r\nit the name of _Antilope chickara_, as that vernacular name is,\r\nthroughout all India, applied to the Indian Gazelle.\r\n\r\nIn 1839 Sir Walter (then Mr.) Elliot, in his Catalogue of the Mammals\r\nof the Southern Mahratta country, published in the ‘Madras Journal’\r\nfor that year, proposed, rather hesitatingly, to separate the form\r\nof this Antelope which occurs in that district under the name\r\n_subquadricornutus_, from the fact that the anterior pair of\r\nhorns are in some cases not developed at all, and in other cases only\r\noccur as small projections on the skull. But Blyth, one of our leading\r\nauthorities upon Indian mammals, after discussing this question, came\r\nto the conclusion that the specimens forwarded to Calcutta by Mr.\r\nElliot did not differ specifically from the common Bengal form, the\r\nfact being that in this Antelope the development of the front horns is\r\nvery variable, and that in many cases these organs appear to be reduced\r\nto mere tubercles, or to be altogether absent. Blyth allowed that this\r\nreduction of the front horns is more general in specimens from the\r\nsouthern districts of India, although individuals with fully developed\r\nfront horns are likewise occasionally found in that part of its range.\r\nBlyth also subsequently stated that he had seen horns of both the\r\nsupposed species which had been obtained in the same district near\r\nMidnapore (see J. A. S. B. xvi. pt. 2, p. 879).\r\n\r\nA figure of the head of the Four-horned Antelope is given by General\r\nKinloch in his useful work on ‘Large Game Shooting in Thibet and the\r\nNorth-West.’ His account of this species is as follows:--“Four-horned\r\nAntelopes are generally found alone, or frequently in pairs; they\r\nconceal themselves in long grass or among low bushes, and somewhat\r\nresemble hares in their habits. They are seldom to be seen out\r\nfeeding, but usually jump up at the feet of the hunter and bound\r\naway at a great pace. I have observed that they generally make their\r\nappearance when least expected, and I do not recollect ever meeting\r\nwith one among the Sewaliks when I have been actually hunting for them.”\r\n\r\nIn 1847 Hodgson, the well-known naturalist of Nepal, in a paper\r\npublished in the ‘Calcutta Journal of Natural History,’ went even\r\nfurther than Sir Walter Elliot and proposed to make five species\r\nof this Antelope. These species appear to have been founded upon\r\nindividual variations only and have not met with acceptance in any\r\nquarter.\r\n\r\nReferring to Mr. W. L. Sclater’s ‘Catalogue of the Specimens of Mammals\r\nin the Indian Museum, Calcutta’ (part ii., 1891), we find a good series\r\nof specimens of the Four-horned Antelope registered as being preserved\r\nin that Institution. But only one species is recognized from all\r\nparts of India, and the specimens are all entered under _Tetraceros\r\nquadricornis_.\r\n\r\nIn his excellent ‘Manual of the Mammals of British India’ Dr. W.\r\nT. Blanford describes the range of this Antelope as follows:--“The\r\nFour-horned Antelope is found all along the base of the Himalayas from\r\nthe Punjab to Nepal. It also occurs in most parts of the Peninsula\r\nwhere the country is wooded and hilly, but not in dense jungle, but\r\nis not found in the Gangetic plain nor on the Malabar coast in the\r\nMadras Presidency. It is said by Mr. Murray to be met with in Sind.\r\nIt is common in the wooded parts of Rajputana, throughout the Bombay\r\nPresidency, the Central Provinces, and the northern parts of Madras;\r\nit is less abundant to the eastward in Chhattisgarh, Chutia Nagpur,\r\nBengal, and Orissa, and to the southward in Mysore, but it occurs in\r\nthe latter State occasionally, and has been observed on the Nilgiri and\r\nPalni hills. It is unknown in Ceylon and east of the Bay of Bengal.”\r\n\r\nThe experienced sportsman Mr. J. D. Inverarity of Bombay writes of this\r\nspecies as follows:--“This is a forest-antelope, living entirely in the\r\njungle. It is not gregarious, but is met with either alone or in pairs.\r\nThe female brings forth one or two young, and occasionally the two old\r\nand two young ones may be seen together. Though not forming a special\r\nobject of pursuit, a shot at the ‘Baikrie,’ as it is generally called\r\non the Bombay side of India, is often got when out stalking other game.\r\nIf you see one before it sees you it is fairly easy to stalk it; but\r\nit more often happens that they see you first, when they will not\r\nadmit of approach. On three or four occasions they have stood stupidly\r\nlooking at me as I walked in full view slowly towards them, and have\r\nallowed me to get within 20 yards before bolting. This only occurs when\r\none does not want to shoot them. Forsyth says that the females are more\r\nnumerous than the bucks, and bear the same proportion to each other as\r\nthe does and bucks of the black buck. At one time I thought the same\r\nmyself, but further experience has made me sure that this is not the\r\nfact, and that bucks are nearly, if not quite, as numerous as does. The\r\nfemale is hornless. The male has four horns; the posterior and larger\r\npair in a good specimen will be four inches long or a little more.\r\nOne-and-a-half inches is a good length for the anterior horns and is\r\nnot often exceeded. In some heads the anterior horns are absent, though\r\nthe bony knobs are covered with a callous black skin.”\r\n\r\nThe Four-horned Antelope is not unfrequently brought alive to Europe,\r\nbut cannot be said to accommodate itself very readily to our northern\r\nclimate. In 1868 a single specimen was received by the Zoological\r\nSociety of London as a present from the Babu Rajendra Mullick, of\r\nCalcutta. In 1881 a pair of the typical form were acquired by purchase,\r\nand bred in the Regent’s Park in the following spring. A female calf\r\nwas born on February 28th, 1882.\r\n\r\nIn 1875 three examples of the subspecies (or variety) without the\r\nanterior horns were obtained by purchase. Several examples of this same\r\nform have been received of late years, but have not thriven in the\r\nSociety’s Gardens. At the present time there is only a single female\r\nleft in the Collection.\r\n\r\nOur figure of this Antelope (Plate XXIV.) was lithographed by Smit from\r\na sketch of Mr. Wolf’s. It represents an adult male of the typical\r\nsubspecies in two positions.\r\n\r\n    _August, 1895._\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Prepared (for the authors) by Mr. F. H. WATERHOUSE,\r\nLibrarian to the Zoological Society of London.\r\n\r\n[2] The term _anteorbital gland_ denotes the so-called “tear-bag”\r\nwhich opens on the face of many Antelopes and Deer. The _lachrymal\r\npits_ are placed in a depression of the skull below the orbit of\r\nthe eye in the lachrymal bone, and contain the above-mentioned gland.\r\nThe _lachrymal vacuity_ is a larger or smaller aperture between\r\nsome of the component bones of the skull, situated near the lachrymal\r\npit and at the base of the nasal bones, which form a thin roofing over\r\nthe cavity of the nose. The term _supraorbital pits_ is applied\r\nto deep excavations in the forehead of the skull between the eyes,\r\nwhich lead into perforations traversing the thickness of the bone. The\r\n_molar teeth_ are the last three teeth on either side of each jaw.\r\n\r\n[3] These three measurements, when obtainable, will be given of the\r\nskull of every species throughout the work. The “basal length” is taken\r\nfrom the front lower edge of the large hole at the back of the skull,\r\nthe _foramen magnum_, to the front of the muzzle, in a straight line;\r\nthe other two explain themselves. The fourth and fifth measurements\r\nare only given in this genus to show the development of the frontal\r\nelongation.\r\n\r\n[4] These variations in curvature are probably mainly due to\r\ndifferences in age, the growth of the curved basal part of the horns\r\ngiving at the various stages widely different directions to their\r\ntips.--S. & T.\r\n\r\n[5] See Mr. Ravenstein’s narrative of this journey, Pr.

See below, p. 124.\r\n\r\n[11] An animal to which the following names refer has been described as\r\na member of this genus:--\r\n\r\n_Antilope (Cephalophus) quadriscopa_, =H. Sm.= Griff. An.

Whatever it\r\nmay have been it has never been rediscovered, nor is its description\r\nsufficient for us to assign it to its proper place in the group.\r\n\r\n[12] From Loanda, farther south, the Lisbon Museum received, in 1869,\r\nthe head of a large Duiker, which our friend Dr. Barboza du Bocage\r\nreferred, rightly as it now proves, to Gray’s _C. longiceps_.\r\nAfterwards, however, in 1878, struck by the great development of\r\nthe rufous crest, of which no mention had been previously made, he\r\ndistinguished it as _C. ruficrista_. Thanks to his kindness we\r\nhave now had an opportunity of comparing the typical head with those\r\nof the mounted specimens in the British Museum, and find it to be\r\nunquestionably the same, although, as the latter are very old, the\r\nrufous crests have been worn off and but little trace of them is left.\r\nOur figure (Plate XIV. fig. 2) shows, however, that in rather younger\r\nanimals the crest is both well developed and very much of the same\r\nrufous colour as in the Lisbon example.\r\n\r\n[13] Hand-l.
