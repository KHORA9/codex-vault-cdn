BEAM PIPER\r\n\r\n\r\n_First of Two Parts. The Paratime Police had a real headache this\r\ntime! Tracing one man in a population of millions is easy--compared\r\nto finding one gang hiding out on one of billions of probability lines!_\r\n\r\n                         Illustrated by Freas\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nASTOUNDING SCIENCE-FICTION\r\n\r\n\r\nKiro Soran, the guard captain, stood in the shadow of the veranda\r\nroof, his white cloak thrown back to display the scarlet lining. He\r\nrubbed his palm reflectively on the checkered butt of his revolver and\r\nwatched the four men at the table.\r\n\r\n\"And ten tens are a hundred,\" one of the clerks in blue jackets said,\r\nadding another stack to the pile of gold coins.\r\n\r\n\"Nineteen hundreds,\" one of the pair in dirty striped robes agreed,\r\ntaking a stone from the box in front of him and throwing it away. Only\r\none stone remained. \"One more hundred to pay.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the blue-jacketed plantation clerks made a tally mark; his\r\ncompanion counted out coins, ten and ten and ten.\r\n\r\nDosu Golan, the plantation manager, tapped impatiently on his polished\r\nboot leg with a thin riding whip.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:]\r\n\r\n\"I don't like this,\" he said, in another and entirely different\r\nlanguage. \"I know, chattel slavery's an established custom on this\r\nsector, and we have to conform to local usages, but it sickens me to\r\nhave to haggle with these swine over the price of human beings. On\r\nthe Zarkantha Sector, we used nothing but free wage-labor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Migratory workers,\" the guard captain said. \"Humanitarian\r\nconsiderations aside, I can think of a lot better ways of meeting the\r\nlabor problem on a fruit plantation than by buying slaves you need for\r\nthree months a year and have to feed and quarter and clothe and doctor\r\nthe whole twelve.\"\r\n\r\n\"Twenty hundreds of _obus_,\" the clerk who had been counting the money\r\nsaid. \"That is the payment, is it not, Coru-hin-Irigod?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is the payment,\" the slave dealer replied.\r\n\r\nThe clerk swept up the remaining coins, and his companion took them\r\nover and put them in an iron-bound chest, snapping the padlock. The\r\ntwo guards who had been loitering at one side slung their rifles and\r\npicked up the chest, carrying it into the plantation house. The slave\r\ndealer and his companion arose, putting their money into a leather\r\nbag; Coru-hin-Irigod turned and bowed to the two men in white cloaks.\r\n\r\n\"The slaves are yours, noble lords,\" he said.\r\n\r\nAcross the plantation yard, six more men in striped robes, with\r\ncarbines slung across their backs, approached; with them came another\r\nman in a hooded white cloak, and two guards in blue jackets and red\r\ncaps, with bayoneted rifles. The man in white and his armed attendants\r\ncame toward the house; the six Calera slavers continued across the\r\nyard to where their horses were picketed.\r\n\r\n\"If I do not offend the noble lords, then,\" Coru-hin-Irigod said, \"I\r\nbeg their sufferance to depart. I and my men have far to ride if we\r\nwould reach Careba by nightfall. The Lord, the Great Lord, the Lord\r\nGod Safar watch between us until we meet again.\"\r\n\r\nUrado Alatana, the labor foreman, came up onto the porch as the two\r\nslavers went down.\r\n\r\n\"Have a good look at them, Radd?\" the guard captain asked.\r\n\r\n\"You think I'm crazy enough to let those bandits out of here with two\r\nthousand _obus_--forty thousand Paratemporal Exchange Units--of the\r\nCompany's money without knowing what we're getting?\" the other\r\nparried. \"They're all right--nice, clean, healthy-looking lot. I did\r\neverything but take them apart and inspect the pieces while they were\r\nbeing unshackled at the stockade. I'd like to know where this\r\nCoru-hin-Whatshisname got them, though. They're not local stuff. Lot\r\ndarker, and they're jabbering among themselves in some lingo I never\r\nheard before. A few are wearing some rags of clothing, and they have\r\nodd-looking sandals. I noticed that most of them showed marks of\r\nrecent whipping. That may mean they're troublesome, or it may just\r\nmean that these Caleras are a lot of sadistic brutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor devils!\" The man called Dosu Golan was evidently hoping that\r\nhe'd never catch himself talking about fellow humans like that. The\r\nguard captain turned to him.\r\n\r\n\"Coming to have a look at them, Doth?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"You go, Kirv; I'll see them later.\"\r\n\r\n\"Still not able to look the Company's property in the face?\" the\r\ncaptain asked gently. \"You'll not get used to it any sooner than now.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you're right.\" For a moment Dosu Golan watched\r\nCoru-hin-Irigod and his followers canter out of the yard and break\r\ninto a gallop on the road beyond. Then he tucked his whip under his\r\narm. \"All right, then. Let's go see them.\"\r\n\r\nThe labor foreman went into the house; the manager and the guard\r\ncaptain went down the steps and set out across the yard. A big\r\nslat-sided wagon, drawn by four horses, driven by an old slave in a\r\nblue smock and a thing like a sunbonnet, rumbled past, loaded with\r\nnewly-picked oranges. Blue woodsmoke was beginning to rise from the\r\nstoves at the open kitchen and a couple of slaves were noisily\r\nchopping wood. Then they came to the stockade of close-set pointed\r\npoles. A guard sergeant in a red-trimmed blue jacket, armed with a\r\nrevolver, met them with a salute which Kiro Soran returned: he\r\nunfastened the gate and motioned four or five riflemen into positions\r\nfrom which they could fire in between the poles in case the slaves\r\nturned on their new owners.\r\n\r\nThere seemed little danger of that, though Kiro Soran kept his hand\r\nclose to the butt of his revolver. The slaves, an even hundred of\r\nthem, squatted under awnings out of the sun, or stood in line to drink\r\nat the water-butt. They furtively watched the two men who had entered\r\namong them, as though expecting blows or kicks; when none were\r\nforthcoming, they relaxed slightly. As the labor foreman had said,\r\nthey were clean and looked healthy. They were all nearly naked; there\r\nwere about as many women as men, but no children or old people.\r\n\r\n\"Radd's right,\" the captain told the new manager. \"They're not local.\r\nMuch darker skins, and different face-structure; faces wedge-shaped\r\ninstead of oval, and differently shaped noses, and brown eyes instead\r\nof black. I've seen people like that, somewhere, but--\"\r\n\r\nHe fell silent. A suspicion, utterly fantastic, had begun to form in\r\nhis mind, and he stepped closer to a group of a dozen-odd, the manager\r\nfollowing him. One or two had been unmercifully lashed, not long ago,\r\nand all bore a few lash-marks. Odd sort of marks, more like\r\nburn-blisters than welts. He'd have to have the Company doctor look at\r\nthem. Then he caught their speech, and the suspicion was converted to\r\ncertainty.\r\n\r\n\"These are not like the others: they wear fine garments, and walk\r\nproudly. They look stern, but not cruel. They are the real masters\r\nhere; the others are but servants.\"\r\n\r\nHe grasped the manager's arm and drew him aside.\r\n\r\n\"You know that language?\" he asked. When the man called Dosu Golan\r\nshook his head, he continued: \"That's Kharanda; it's a dialect spoken\r\nby a people in the Ganges Valley, in India, on the Kholghoor Sector of\r\nthe Fourth Level.\"\r\n\r\nDosu Golan blinked, and his face went blank for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"You mean they're from outtime?\" he demanded. \"Are you sure?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did two years on Fourth Level Kholghoor with the Paratime Police,\r\nbefore I took this job,\" the man called Kiro Soran replied. \"And\r\nanother thing. Those lash-marks were made with some kind of an\r\nelectric whip. Not these rawhide quirts the Caleras use.\"\r\n\r\nIt took the plantation manager all of five seconds to add that up. The\r\nanswer frightened him.\r\n\r\n\"Kirv, this is going to make a simply hideous uproar, all the way up\r\nto Home Time Line main office,\" he said. \"I don't know what I'm going\r\nto do--\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I know what I have to do.\" The captain raised his voice, using\r\nthe local language: \"Sergeant! Run to the guardhouse, and tell\r\nSergeant Adarada to mount up twenty of his men and take off after\r\nthose Caleras who sold us these slaves. They're headed down the road\r\ntoward the river. Tell him to bring them all back, and especially\r\ntheir chief, Coru-hin-Irigod, and him I want alive and able to answer\r\nquestions. And then get the white-cloak lord Urado Alatena, and come\r\nback here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, captain.\" The guards were all Yarana people; they disliked\r\nCaleras intensely. The sergeant threw a salute, turned, and ran.\r\n\r\n\"Next, we'll have to isolate these slaves,\" Kiro Soran said. \"You'd\r\nbetter make a full report to the Company as soon as possible. I'm\r\ngoing to transpose to Police Terminal Time Line and make my report to\r\nthe Sector-Regional Subchief. Then--\"\r\n\r\n\"Now wait a moment, Kirv,\" Dosu Golan protested. \"After all, I'm the\r\nmanager, even if I am new here. It's up to me to make the decisions--\"\r\n\r\nKiro Soran shook his head. \"Sorry, Doth. Not this one,\" he said. \"You\r\nknow the terms under which I was hired by the Company. I'm still a\r\nfield agent of the Paratime Police, and I'm reporting back on duty as\r\nsoon as I can transpose to Police Terminal. Look; here are a hundred\r\nmen and women who have been shifted from one time-line, on one\r\nparatemporal sector of probability, to another. Why, the world from\r\nwhich these people came doesn't even exist in this space-time\r\ncontinuum. There's only one way they could have gotten here, and\r\nthat's the way we did--in a Ghaldron-Hesthor paratemporal\r\ntransposition field. You can carry it on from there as far as you\r\nlike, but the only thing it adds up to is a case for the Paratime\r\nPolice. You had better include in your report mention that I've\r\nreverted to police status; my Company pay ought to be stopped as of\r\nnow. And until somebody who outranks me is sent here, I'm in complete\r\ncharge. Paratime Transposition Code, Section XVII, Article 238.\"\r\n\r\nThe plantation manager nodded. Kiro Soran knew how he must feel; he\r\nlaid a hand gently on the younger man's shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"You understand how it is, Doth; this is the only thing I can do.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand, Kirv. Count on me for absolutely anything.\" He looked\r\nat the brown-skinned slaves, and lines of horror and loathing appeared\r\naround his mouth. \"To think that some of our own people would do a\r\nthing like this! I hope you can catch the devils! Are you transposing\r\nout, now?\"\r\n\r\n\"In a few minutes. While I'm gone, have the doctor look at those\r\nwhip-injuries. Those things could get infected. Fortunately, he's one\r\nof our own people.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, of course. And I'll have these slaves isolated, and if Adarada\r\nbrings back Coru-hin-Irigod and his gang before you get back, I'll\r\nhave them locked up and waiting for you. I suppose you want to\r\nnarco-hypnotize and question the whole lot, slaves and slavers?\"\r\n\r\nThe labor foreman, known locally as Urado Alatena, entered the\r\nstockade.\r\n\r\n\"What's wrong, Kirv?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nThe Paratime Police agent told him, briefly. The labor foreman\r\nwhistled, threw a quick glance at the nearest slaves, and nodded.\r\n\r\n\"I knew there was something funny about them,\" he said. \"Doth, what a\r\nsimply beastly thing to happen, two days after you take charge here!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not his fault,\" the Paratime Police agent said. \"I'm the one the\r\nCompany'll be sore at, but I'd rather have them down on me rather than\r\nold Tortha Karf. Well, sit on the lid till I get back,\" he told both\r\nof them. \"We'll need some kind of a story for the locals. Let's\r\nsee--Explain to the guards, in the hearing of some of the more\r\ntalkative slaves, that these slaves are from the Asian mainland, that\r\nthey are of a people friendly to our people, and that they were\r\nkidnaped by pirates, our enemies. That ought to explain everything\r\nsatisfactorily.\"\r\n\r\nOn his way back to the plantation house, he saw a clump of local\r\nslaves staring curiously at the stockade, and noticed that the guards\r\nhad unslung their rifles and fixed their bayonets. None of them had\r\nany idea, of course, of what had happened, but they all seemed to\r\nknow, by some sort of ESP, that something was seriously wrong. It was\r\ngoing to get worse, too, when strangers began arriving, apparently\r\nfrom nowhere, at the plantation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVerkan Vall waited until the small, dark-eyed woman across the\r\ncircular table had helped herself from one of the bowls on the\r\nrevolving disk in the middle, then rotated it to bring the platter of\r\ncold boar-ham around to himself.\r\n\r\n\"Want some of this, Dalla?\" he asked, transferring a slice of ham and\r\na spoonful of wine sauce to his plate.\r\n\r\n\"No, I'll have some of the venison,\" the black-haired girl beside him\r\nsaid. \"And some of the pickled beans. We'll be getting our fill of\r\npork, for the next month.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought the Dwarma Sector people were vegetarians,\" Jandar Jard,\r\nthe theatrical designer, said. \"Most nonviolent peoples are, aren't\r\nthey?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, the Dwarma people haven't any specific taboo against taking\r\nlife,\" Bronnath Zara, the dark-eyed woman in the brightly colored\r\ngown, told him. \"They're just utterly noncombative, nonaggressive.\r\nWhen I was on the Dwarma Sector, there was a horrible scandal at the\r\nvillage where I was staying. It seems that a farmer and a meat butcher\r\nfought over the price of a pig. They actually raised their voices and\r\nshouted contradictions at each other. That happened two years before,\r\nand people were still talking about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't think they had any money, either,\" Verkan Vall's wife,\r\nHadron Dalla, said.\r\n\r\n\"They don't,\" Zara said. \"It's all barter and trade. What are you and\r\nVall going to use for a visible means of support, while you're there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I have my mandolin, and I've learned all the traditional Dwarma\r\nsongs by hypno-mech,\" Dalla said. \"And Transtime Tours is fitting Vall\r\nout with a bag of tools; he's going to do repair work and carpentry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, good; you'll be welcome anywhere,\" Zara, the sculptress, said.\r\n\"They're always glad to entertain a singer, and for people who do the\r\nfine decorative work they do, they're the most incompetent practical\r\nmechanics I've ever seen or heard of. You're going to travel from\r\nvillage to village?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. The cover-story is that we're lovers who have left our village\r\nin order not to make Vall's former wife unhappy by our presence,\"\r\nDalla said.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, good! That's entirely in the Dwarma romantic tradition,\" Bronnath\r\nZara approved. \"Ordinarily, you know, they don't like to travel. They\r\nhave a saying: 'Happy are the trees, they abide in their own place;\r\nsad are the winds, forever they wander.' But that'll be a fine\r\nexplanation.\"\r\n\r\nThalvan Dras, the big man with the black beard and the long red coat\r\nand cloth-of-gold sash who lounged in the host's seat, laughed.\r\n\r\n\"I can just see Vall mending pots, and Dalla playing that mandolin and\r\nsinging,\" he said. \"At least, you'll be getting away from police work.\r\nI don't suppose they have anything like police on the Dwarma Sector?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no; they don't even have any such concept,\" Bronnath Zara said.\r\n\"When somebody does something wrong, his neighbors all come and talk\r\nto him about it till he gets ashamed, then they all forgive him and\r\nhave a feast. They're lovely people, so kind and gentle. But you'll\r\nget awfully tired of them in about a month. They have absolutely no\r\nrespect for anybody's privacy. In fact, it seems slightly indecent to\r\nthem for anybody to want privacy.\"\r\n\r\nOne of Thalvan Dras' human servants came into the room, coughed\r\napologetically, and said:\r\n\r\n\"A visiphone-call for His Valor, the Mavrad of Nerros.\"\r\n\r\nVall went on nibbling ham and wine sauce; the servant repeated the\r\nannouncement a trifle more loudly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:]\r\n\r\n\"Vall, you're being paged!\" Thalvan Dras told him, with a touch of\r\nimpatience.\r\n\r\nVerkan Vall looked blank for an instant, then grinned. It had been so\r\nlong since he had even bothered to think about that antiquated title\r\nof nobility--\r\n\r\n\"Vall's probably forgotten that he has a title,\" a girl across the\r\ntable, wearing an almost transparent gown and nothing else, laughed.\r\n\r\n\"That's something the Mavrad of Mnirna and Thalvabar never forgets,\"\r\nJandar Jard drawled, with what, in a woman, would have been\r\ncattishness.\r\n\r\nThalvan Dras gave him a hastily repressed look of venomous anger, then\r\nsaid something, more to Verkan Vall than to Jandar Jard, about titles\r\nof nobility being the marks of social position and responsibility\r\nwhich their bearers should never forget. That jab, Vall thought,\r\nfollowing the servant out of the room, had been a mistake on Jard's\r\npart. A music-drama, for which he had designed the settings, was due\r\nto open here in Dhergabar in another ten days. Thalvan Dras would\r\ncherish spite, and a word from the Mavrad of Mnirna and Thalvabar\r\nwould set a dozen critics to disparaging Jandar's work. On the other\r\nhand, maybe it had been smart of Jandar Jard to antagonize Thalvan\r\nDras; for every critic who bowed slavishly to the wealthy nobleman,\r\nthere were at least two more who detested him unutterably, and they\r\nwould rush to Jandar Jard's defense, and in the ensuing uproar, the\r\nsettings would get more publicity than the drama itself.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the visiphone booth, Vall found a girl in a green blouse, with the\r\nParatime Police insigne on her shoulder, looking out of the screen.\r\nThe wall behind her was pale green striped in gold and black.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Eldra,\" he greeted her.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Chief's Assistant: I'm sorry to bother you, but the Chief\r\nwants to talk to you. Just a moment, please.\"\r\n\r\nThe screen exploded into a kaleidoscopic flash of lights and colors,\r\nthen cleared again. This time, a man looked out of it. He was well\r\ninto middle age; close to his three hundredth year. His hair, a\r\nuniform iron-gray, was beginning to thin in front, and he was\r\nacquiring the beginnings of a double chin. His name was Tortha Karf,\r\nand he was Chief of Paratime Police, and Verkan Vall's superior.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Vall. Glad I was able to locate you. When are you and Dalla\r\nleaving?\"\r\n\r\n\"As soon as we can get away from this luncheon, here. Oh, say an hour.\r\nWe're taking a rocket to Zarabar, and transposing from there to\r\nPassenger Terminal Sixteen, and from there to the Dwarma Sector.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Vall, I hate to bother you like this,\" Tortha Karf said, \"but I\r\nwish you'd stop by Headquarters on your way to the rocketport.\r\nSomething's come up--it may be a very nasty business--and I'd like to\r\ntalk to you about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Chief, let me remind you that this vacation, which I've had to\r\npostpone four times already, has been overdue for four years,\" Vall\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Vall, I know. You've been working very hard, and you and Dalla\r\nare entitled to a little time together. I just want you to look into\r\nsomething, before you leave.\"\r\n\r\n\"It'll have to take some fast looking. Our rocket blasts off in two\r\nhours.\"\r\n\r\n\"It may take a little longer; if it does, you and Dalla can transpose\r\nto Police Terminal and take a rocket for Zarabar Equivalent, and\r\ntranspose from there to Passenger Sixteen. It would save time if you\r\nbrought Dalla with you to Headquarters.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dalla won't like this,\" Vall understated.\r\n\r\n\"No. I'm afraid not.\" Tortha Karf looked around apprehensively, as\r\nthough estimating the damage an enraged Hadron Dalla could do to his\r\noffice furnishings. \"Well, try to get here as soon as you can.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThalvan Dras was holding forth, when Vall returned, on one of his\r\nfavorite preoccupations.\r\n\r\n\"... Reason I'm taking such an especially active interest in this\r\nyear's Arts Exhibitions; I've become disturbed at the extent to which\r\nso many of our artists have been content to derive their motifs, even\r\ntheir techniques, from outtime art.\" He was using his vocowriter,\r\nrather than his conversational, voice. \"I yield to no one in my\r\nappreciation of outtime art--you all know how devotedly I collect\r\nobjects of art from all over paratime--but our own artists should\r\nendeavor to express their artistic values in our own artistic idioms.\"\r\n\r\nVall bent over his wife's shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"We have to leave, right away,\" he whispered.\r\n\r\n\"But our rocket doesn't blast off for two hours--\"\r\n\r\nThalvan Dras had stopped talking and was looking at them in annoyance.\r\n\r\n\"I have to go to Headquarters before we leave. It'll save time if you\r\ncome along.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, Vall!\" She looked at him in consternation. \"Was that Tortha\r\nKarf, calling?\" She replaced her plate on the table and got to her\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n\"I'm dreadfully sorry, Dras,\" he addressed their host. \"I just had a\r\ncall from Tortha Karf. A few minor details that must be cleared up,\r\nbefore I leave Home Time Line. If you'll accept our thanks for a\r\nwonderful luncheon--\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, certainly, Vall. Brogoth, will you call--\" He gave a slight\r\nchuckle. \"I'm so used to having Brogoth Zaln at my elbow that I'd\r\nforgotten he wasn't here. Wait. I'll call one of the servants to have\r\na car for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't bother; we'll take an aircab,\" Vall told him.\r\n\r\n\"But you simply can't take a public cab!\" The black-bearded nobleman\r\nwas shocked at such an obscene idea. \"I will have a car ready for you\r\nin a few minutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sorry, Dras; we have to hurry. We'll get a cab on the roof. Good-by,\r\neverybody; sorry to have to break away like this. See you all when we\r\nget back.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHadron Dalla watched dejectedly as the green crags and escarpments of\r\nthe Paratime Building loomed above the city in front of them, and\r\nbegan slipping under the aircab. She felt like a prisoner recaptured\r\nat the moment when attempted escape was about to succeed.\r\n\r\n\"I knew it,\" she said. \"I knew he'd find something. He's trying to\r\nbreak things up between us, the way he did twenty years ago.'\"\r\n\r\nVall crushed out his cigarette and said nothing. That hadn't been\r\ntrue, and she knew it as well as he did. There had been many other\r\nfactors involved in the disintegration of their previous marriage,\r\nmost of them of her own contribution. But that had been twenty years\r\nago, she told herself. This time it would be different, if only--\r\n\r\n\"Really, Vall, he's never liked me,\" she went on. \"He's jealous of me,\r\nI think. You're to be his successor, when he retires, and he thinks\r\nI'm not a good influence--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, rubbish, Dalla! The Chief has always liked you,\" Vall replied.\r\n\"If he didn't, do you think he'd always be inviting us to that farm of\r\nhis, on Fifth Level Sicily? It's just that this job of ours has no\r\nend; something's always turning up, outtime.\"\r\n\r\nThe music that the cab had been playing died away. \"Paratime Building,\r\njust below,\" it said, in a light feminine voice. \"Which landing stage,\r\nplease?\" Vall leaned forward and punched at the buttons in front of\r\nhim. Something in the cab's electronic brain gave a rapid series of\r\nclicks as it shifted from the general Paratime Building beam to the\r\nbeam of the Paratime Police landing stage, then it said, \"Thank you.\"\r\nThe building below seemed to rotate upward toward them as it settled\r\ndown. Then the antigrav-field snapped off, the cab door popped open,\r\nand the cab said: \"Good-by, now. Ride with me again, sometime.\"\r\n\r\nThey crossed the landing stage, entered the antigrav shaft, and\r\nfloated downward; at the end of a hallway, below, Vall opened the door\r\nof Tortha Karf's office and ushered her through ahead of him.\r\n\r\nTortha Karf, inside the semicircle of his desk, was speaking into a\r\nrecording phone as they approached. He shut off the machine and waved,\r\na cigarette in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Come on back and sit down,\" he invited. \"Be with you in a moment.\"\r\nThen he switched on the phone again and went on talking--something\r\nabout prompter evaluation and transmission of reports and less\r\nreliance on robot equipment. \"Sign that up, my personal order, and see\r\nit's transmitted to everybody down to and including Sector Regional\r\nSubchief level,\" he finished, then hung up the phone and turned to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry about this,\" he said. \"Sit down, if you please. Cigarettes?\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head and sat down in one of the chairs behind the desk;\r\nshe started to relax and then caught herself and sat erect, her hands\r\non her lap.\r\n\r\n\"This won't interfere with your vacation, Vall,\" Tortha Karf was\r\nsaying. \"I just need a little help before you transpose out.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have to catch the rocket for Zarabar in an hour and a half,\" Dalla\r\nreminded him.\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry about that; if you miss the commercial rocket, our police\r\nrockets can give it an hour's start and pass it before it gets to\r\nZarabar,\" Tortha Karf said. Then he turned to Vall. \"Here's what's\r\nhappened,\" he said. \"One of our field agents on detached duty as guard\r\ncaptain for Consolidated Outtime Foodstuffs on a fruit plantation in\r\nwestern North America, Third Level Esaron Sector, was looking over a\r\nlot of slaves who had been sold to the plantation by a local slave\r\ndealer. He heard them talking among themselves--in Kharanda.\"\r\n\r\nDalla caught the significance of that before Vall did. At first, she\r\nwas puzzled; then, in spite of herself, she was horrified and angry.\r\nTortha Karf was explaining to Vall just where and on what paratemporal\r\nsector Kharanda was spoken.\r\n\r\n\"No possibility that this agent, Skordran Kirv, could have been\r\nmistaken. He worked for a while on Kholghoor Sector, himself; knew the\r\nlanguage by hypno-mech and by two years' use,\" Tortha Karf was saying.\r\n\"So he ordered himself back on duty, had the slaves isolated and the\r\nslave dealers arrested, and then transposed to Police Terminal to\r\nreport. The SecReg Subchief, old Vulthor Tharn, confirmed him in\r\ncharge at this Esaron Sector plantation, and assigned him a couple of\r\ndetectives and a psychist.\"\r\n\r\n\"When was this?\" Vall asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday. One-Five-Nine Day. About 1500 local time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Twenty-three hundred Dhergabar time,\" Vall commented.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. And I just found out about it. Came in in the late morning\r\ngeneralized report-digest; very inconspicuous item, no special urgency\r\nsymbol or anything. Fortunately, one of the report editors spotted it\r\nand messaged Police Terminal for a copy of the original report.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's been a long time since we had anything like that,\" Vall said,\r\nstudying the glowing tip of his cigarette, his face wearing the\r\ncuriously withdrawn expression of a conscious memory recall. \"Fifty\r\nyears ago; the time that gang kidnaped some girls from Second Level\r\nTriplanetary Empire Sector and sold them into the harem of some Fourth\r\nLevel Indo-Turanian sultan.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. That was your first independent case, Vall. That was when I\r\nbegan to think you'd really make a cop. One renegade First Level\r\ncitizen and four or five ServSec Prole hoodlums, with a stolen\r\nfifty-foot conveyer. This looks like a rather more ambitious\r\noperation.\" Dalla got one of her own cigarettes out and lit it. Vall\r\nand Tortha Karf were talking cop talk about method of operation and\r\npossible size of the gang involved, and why the slaves had been\r\nshipped all the way from India to the west coast of North America.\r\n\r\n\"Always ready sale for slaves on the Esaron Sector,\" Vall was saying.\r\n\"And so many small independent states, and different languages, that\r\nouttimers wouldn't be particularly conspicuous.\"\r\n\r\n\"And with this barbarian invasion going on on the Kholghoor Sector,\r\nslaves could be picked up cheaply,\" Tortha Karf added.\r\n\r\nIn spite of her determination to boycott the conversation, curiosity\r\nbegan to get the better of her. She had spent a year and a half on the\r\nKholghoor Sector, investigating alleged psychic powers of the local\r\npriests. There'd been nothing to it--the prophecies weren't\r\nprecognition, they were shrewd inferences, and the miracles weren't\r\npsychokinesis, they were sleight-of-hand. She found herself asking:\r\n\r\n\"What barbarian invasion's this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Central Asian nomadic people, the Croutha,\" Tortha Karf told her.\r\n\"They came down through Khyber Pass about three months ago, turned\r\neast, and hit the headwaters of the Ganges. Without punching a lot of\r\nbuttons to find out exactly, I'd say they're halfway to the delta\r\ncountry by now. Leader seems to be a chieftain called Llamh Droogh the\r\nRed. A lot of paratime trading companies are yelling for permits to\r\nintroduce firearms in the Kholghoor Sector to protect their holdings\r\nthere.\"\r\n\r\nShe nodded. The Fourth Level Kholghoor Sector belonged to what was\r\nknown as Indus-Ganges-Irriwady Basic Sector-Grouping--probability of\r\ncivilization having developed late on the Indian subcontinent, with\r\nthe rest of the world, including Europe, in Stone Age savagery or\r\nearly Bronze Age barbarism. The Kharandas, the people among whom she\r\nhad once done field-research work, had developed a pre-mechanical,\r\nanimal-power, handcraft, edge-weapon culture. She could imagine the\r\nroads jammed with fugitives from the barbarian invaders, the conveyer\r\nhidden among the trees, the lurking slavers--\r\n\r\nWatch it, Dalla! Don't let the old scoundrel play on your feelings!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Well, what do you want me to do, Chief?\" Vall was asking.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I have to know just what this situation's likely to develop\r\ninto, and I want to know why Vulthor Tharn's been sitting on this ever\r\nsince Skordran Kirv reported it to him--\"\r\n\r\n\"I can answer the second one now,\" Vall replied. \"Vulthor Tharn is due\r\nto retire in a few years. He has a negatively good, undistinguished\r\nrecord. He's trying to play it safe.\"\r\n\r\nTortha Karf nodded. \"That's what I thought. Look, Vall; suppose you\r\nand Dalla transpose from here to Police Terminal, and go to Novilan\r\nEquivalent, and give this a quick look-over and report to me, and then\r\nrocket to Zarabar Equivalent and go on with your trip to the Dwarma\r\nSector. It may delay you eight or ten hours, but--\"\r\n\r\n\"Closer twenty-four,\" Vall said. \"I'd have to transpose to this\r\nplantation, on the Esaron Sector. How about it, Dalla? Would you want\r\nto do that?\"\r\n\r\nShe hesitated for a moment, angry with him. He didn't want to refuse,\r\nand he was trying to make her do it for him.\r\n\r\n\"I know, it's a confounded imposition, Dalla,\" Tortha Karf told her.\r\n\"But it's important that I get a prompt and full estimate of the\r\nsituation. This may be something very serious. If it's an isolated\r\nincident, it can be handled in a routine manner, but I'm afraid it's\r\nnot. It has all the marks of a large-scale operation, and if this is a\r\nmatter of mass kidnapings from one sector and transpositions to\r\nanother, you can see what a threat this is to the Paratime Secret.\"\r\n\r\n\"Moral considerations entirely aside,\" Vall said. \"We don't need to\r\ndiscuss them; they're too obvious.\"\r\n\r\nShe nodded. For over twelve millennia, the people of her race and\r\nVall's and Tortha Karf's had been existing as parasites on all the\r\ninnumerable other worlds of alternate probability on the lateral\r\ndimension of time. Smart parasites never injure their hosts, and try\r\nnever to reveal their existence.\r\n\r\n\"We could do that, couldn't we, Vall?\" she asked, angry at herself now\r\nfor giving in. \"And if you want to question these slaves, I speak\r\nKharanda, and I know how they think. And I'm a qualified and licensed\r\nnarco-hypnotic technician.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's splendid, Dalla!\" Tortha Karf enthused. \"Wait a moment;\r\nI'll message Police Terminal to have a rocket ready for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll need a hypno-mech for Kharanda, myself,\" Vall said. \"Dalla, do\r\nyou know Acalan?\" When she shook her head, he turned back to Tortha\r\nKarf. \"Look; it's about a four-hour rocket hop to Novilan Equivalent.\r\nSay we have the hypno-mech machines installed in the rocket; Dalla and\r\nI can take our language lessons on the way, and be ready to go to work\r\nas soon as we land.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good idea,\" Tortha Karf approved. \"I'll order that done, right away.\r\nNow--\"\r\n\r\nOddly enough, she wasn't feeling so angry, now that she had committed\r\nherself and Vall. Come to think of it, she had never been on Police\r\nTerminal Time Line; very few people, outside the Paratime Police, ever\r\nhad. And, she had always wanted to learn more about Vall's work, and\r\nparticipate in it with him. And if she'd made him refuse, it would\r\nhave been something ugly between them all the time they would be on\r\nthe Dwarma Sector. But this way--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe big circular conveyer room was crowded, as it had been every\r\nminute of every day for the past ten thousand years. At the great\r\ncircular desk in the center, departing or returning police officers\r\nwere checking in or out with the flat-topped cylindrical robot\r\nclerks, or talking to human attendants. Some were in the regulation\r\ngreen uniform; others, like himself, were in civilian clothes; more\r\nwere in outtime costumes from all over paratime. Fringed robes and\r\ncloth-of-gold sashes and conical caps from the Second Level Khiftan\r\nSector; Fourth Level Proto-Aryan mail and helmets; the short tunics\r\nand kilts of Fourth Level Alexandrian-Roman Sector; the Zarkantha\r\nloincloth and felt cap and daggers; there were priestly vestments\r\nstiff with gold, and military uniforms; there were trousers and\r\njackboots and bare legs; blasters, and swords, and pistols, and bows\r\nand quivers, and spears. And the place was loud with a babel of voices\r\nand the clatter of teleprinters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:]\r\n\r\nDalla was looking about her in surprised delight; for her, the\r\nvacation had already begun. He was glad; for a while, he had been\r\nafraid that she would be unhappy about it. He guided her through the\r\ncrowd to the desk, spoke for a while to one of the human attendants,\r\nand found out which was their conveyer. It was a fixed-destination\r\nshuttler, operative only between Home Time Line and Police Terminal,\r\nfrom which most of the Paratime Police operations were routed. He put\r\nDall in through the sliding door, followed, and closed it behind him,\r\nlocking it. Then, before he closed the starting switch, he drew a\r\npistollike weapon and checked it.\r\n\r\nIn theory, the Ghaldron-Hesthor paratemporal transposition field was\r\nuninfluenced by material objects outside it. In practice, however,\r\nsuch objects occasionally intruded, and sometimes they were alive and\r\nhostile. The last time he had been in this conveyer room, he had seen\r\na quartet of returning officers emerge from a conveyer dome dragging\r\na dead lion by the tail. The sigma-ray needler, which he carried, was\r\nthe only weapon which could be used, under the circumstances. It had\r\nno effect whatever on any material structure and could be used inside\r\nan activated conveyer without deranging the conductor-mesh, as, say, a\r\nbullet or the vibration of an ultrasonic paralyzer would do, and it\r\nwas instantly fatal to anything having a central nervous system. It\r\nwas a good weapon to use outtime for that reason, also; even on the\r\nmost civilized time-line, the most elaborate autopsy would reveal no\r\nspecific cause of death.\r\n\r\n\"What's the Esaron Sector like?\" Dalla asked, as the conveyer dome\r\naround them coruscated with shifting light and vanished.\r\n\r\n\"Third Level; probability of abortive attempt to colonize this planet\r\nfrom Mars about a hundred thousand years ago,\" he said. \"A few\r\nsurvivors--a shipload or so--were left to shift for themselves while\r\nthe parent civilization on Mars died out. They lost all vestiges of\r\ntheir original Martian culture, even memory of their extraterrestrial\r\norigin. About fifteen hundred to two thousand years ago, a reasonably\r\nhigh electrochemical civilization developed and they began working\r\nwith nuclear energy and developed reaction-drive spaceships. But\r\nthey'd concentrated so on the inorganic sciences, and so far neglected\r\nthe bio-sciences, that when they launched their first ship for Venus\r\nthey hadn't yet developed a germ theory of disease.\"\r\n\r\n\"What happened when they ran into the green-vomit fever?\" Dalla asked.\r\n\r\n\"About what you could expect. The first--and only--ship to return\r\nbrought it back to Terra. Of course, nobody knew what it was, and\r\nbefore the epidemic ended, it had almost depopulated this planet.\r\nSince the survivors knew nothing about germs, they blamed it on the\r\nanger of the gods--the old story of recourse to supernaturalism in the\r\nabsence of a known explanation--and a fanatically anti-scientific cult\r\ngot control. Of course, space travel was taboo; so was nuclear and\r\neven electric power. For some reason, steam power and gunpowder\r\nweren't offensive to the gods. They went back to a low-order\r\nsteam-power, black-powder, culture, and haven't gotten beyond that to\r\nthis day. The relatively civilized regions are on the east coast of\r\nAsia and the west coast of North America; civilized race more or less\r\nCaucasian. Political organization just barely above the tribal\r\nlevel--thousands of petty kingdoms and republics and principalities\r\nand feudal holdings and robbers' roosts. The principal industries are\r\nbrigandage, piracy, slave-raiding, cattle-rustling and intercommunal\r\nwarfare. They have a few ramshackle steam railways, and some\r\nsteamboats on the rivers. We sell them coal and manufactured goods,\r\nmostly in exchange for foodstuffs and tobacco. Consolidated Outtime\r\nFoodstuffs has the sector franchise. That's one of the companies\r\nThalvan Dras gets his money from.\"\r\n\r\nThey had run down through the civilized Second and Third Levels and\r\nwere leaving the Fourth behind and entering the Fifth, existing in the\r\nprobability of a world without human population. Once in a while,\r\naround them, they caught brief flashes of buildings and rocketports\r\nand spaceports and landing stages, as the conveyer took them through\r\nnarrow paratime belts on which their own civilization had established\r\noutposts--Fifth Level Commercial, Fifth Level Passenger, Industrial\r\nSector, Service Sector.\r\n\r\nFinally the conveyer dome around them shimmered into visibility and\r\nmaterialized; when they emerged, there were policemen in green\r\nuniforms who entered to search the dome with drawn needlers to make\r\nsure they had picked up nothing dangerous on the way. The room outside\r\nwas similar to the one they had left on Home Time Line, even to the\r\nshifting, noisy crowd in incongruously-mixed costumes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe rocketport was a ten minutes' trip by aircar from the conveyer\r\nhead; when they boarded the stubby-winged strato-rocket, Vall saw that\r\ntwo of the passenger-seats had square metal cabinets bolted in place\r\nbehind them and blue plastic helmets on swinging arms mounted above\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"Everything's set up,\" the pilot told them. \"Dr. Hadron, you sit on\r\nthe left; that cabinet's loaded with language tape for Acalan. Yours\r\nis loaded with a tape of Kharanda; that's the Fourth Level Kholghoor\r\nlanguage you wanted, Chief's Assistant. Shall I help you get fixed in\r\nyour seats?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, if you please. Here, Dalla, I'll fix that for you.\"\r\n\r\nDalla was already asleep when the pilot was adjusting his helmet and\r\ngiving him his injection. He never felt the rocket tilt into firing\r\nposition, and while he slept, the Kharands language, with all its\r\nvocabulary and grammar, became part of his subconscious knowledge,\r\nneeding only the mental pronunciation of a trigger-symbol to bring it\r\ninto consciousness. The pilot was already unfastening and raising his\r\nhelmet when he opened his eyes. Dalla, beside him, was sipping a cup\r\nof spiced wine.\r\n\r\nOn the landing stage of the Sector-Regional Headquarters at Novilan\r\nEquivalent, four or five people were waiting for them. Vall recognized\r\nthe subchief, Vulthor Tharn, who introduced another man, in riding\r\nboots and a white cloak, as Skordran Kirv. Vall clasped hands with him\r\nwarmly.\r\n\r\n\"Good work, Agent Skordran. You got onto this promptly.\"\r\n\r\n\"I tried to, sir. Do you want the dope now? We have half an hour's\r\nflight to our spatial equivalent, and another half hour in\r\ntransposition.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give it to me on the way,\" he said, and turned to Vulthor Tharn.\r\n\"Our Esaron costumes ready?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Over there in the control tower. We have a temporary conveyer\r\nhead set up about two hundred miles south of here, which will take you\r\nstraight through to the plantation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose you change now, Dalla,\" he said. \"Subchief, I'd like a word\r\nwith you privately.\"\r\n\r\nHe and Vulthor Tharn excused themselves and walked over to the edge of\r\nthe landing stage. The SecReg Subchief was outwardly composed, but\r\nVall sensed that he was worried and embarrassed.\r\n\r\n\"Now, what's been done since you got Agent Skordran's report?\" Vall\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, it seems that this is more serious than we had\r\nanticipated. Field Agent Skordran, who will give you the particulars,\r\nsays that there is every indication that a large and well-organized\r\ngang of paratemporal criminals, our own people, are at work. He says\r\nthat he's found evidence of activities on Fourth Level Kholghoor that\r\ndon't agree with any information we have about conditions on that\r\nsector.\"\r\n\r\n\"Beside transmitting Agent Skordran's report to Dhergabar through the\r\nrobot report-system, what have you done about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I confirmed Agent Skordran in charge of the local investigation, and\r\ngave him two detectives and a psychist, sir. As soon as we could\r\nfurnish hypno-mech indoctrination in Kharanda to other psychists, I\r\nsent them along. He now has four of them, and eight detectives. By\r\nthat time, we had a conveyer head right at this Consolidated Outtime\r\nFoodstuffs plantation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't you just borrow psychists from SecReg for Kholghoor,\r\nEastern India?\" Vall asked. \"Subchief Ranthar would have loaned you a\r\nfew.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I couldn't call on another SecReg for men without higher-echelon\r\nauthorization. Especially not from another Sector Organization, even\r\nanother Level Authority,\" Vulthor Tharn said. \"Beside, it would have\r\ntaken longer to bring them here than hypno-mech our own personnel.\"\r\n\r\nHe was right about the second point. Vall agreed mentally; however,\r\nhis real reason was procedural.\r\n\r\n\"Did you alert Ranthar Jard to what was going on in his SecReg?\" he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\"Gracious, no!\" Vulthor Tharn was scandalized. \"I have no authority to\r\ntell people of equal echelon in other Sector and Level organizations\r\nwhat to do. I put my report through regular channels; it wasn't my\r\nplace to go outside my own jurisdiction.\"\r\n\r\nAnd his report had crawled through channels for fourteen hours, Vall\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n\"Well, on my authority, and in the name of Chief Tortha, you message\r\nRanthar Jard at once; send him every scrap of information you have on\r\nthe subject, and forward additional information as it comes in to\r\nyou. I doubt he'll find anything on any time-line that's being\r\nexploited by any legitimate paratimers. This gang probably work\r\nexclusively on unpenetrated time-lines; this business Skordran Kirv\r\ncame across was a bad blunder on some underling's part.\" He saw Dalla\r\nemerge from the control tower in breeches and boots and a white cloak,\r\nbuckling on a heavy revolver. \"I'll go change, now; you get busy\r\ncalling Ranthar Jard. I'll see you when I get back.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Are you taking over, Chief's Assistant?\" Skordran Kirv asked, as the\r\naircar lifted from the landing stage.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all. My wife and I are starting on our vacation, as soon as I\r\nfind out what's been happening here, and report to Chief Tortha. Did\r\nyour native troopers catch those slavers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, they got them yesterday afternoon; we've had them ever since. Do\r\nyou want the whole thing just as it happened, Assistant Verkan, or\r\njust a condensation?\"\r\n\r\n\"Give me what you think it indicates, remembering that you're probably\r\ntrying to analyze a large situation from a very small sample.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's big, all right,\" Skordran Kirv said. \"This gang can't number\r\nless than a hundred men, maybe several hundred. They must have at\r\nleast two two-hundred-foot conveyers and several small ones, and bases\r\non what sounds like some Fifth Level Time line, and at least one air\r\nfreighter of around five thousand tons. They are operating on a number\r\nof Kholghoor and Esaron time lines.\"\r\n\r\nVerkan Vall nodded. \"I didn't think it was any petty larceny,\" he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"Wait till you hear the rest of it. On the Kholghoor Sector, this gang\r\nis known as the Wizard Traders; we've been using that as a convenience\r\nlabel. They pose as sorcerers--black robes and hood-masks covered with\r\nluminous symbols, voice-amplifiers, cold-light auras, energy-weapons,\r\nmechanical magic tricks, that sort of thing. They have all the Croutha\r\nscared witless. Their procedure is to establish camps in the forest\r\nnear recently conquered Kharanda cities; then they appear to the\r\nCroutha, impress them with their magical powers, and trade\r\nmanufactured goods for Kharanda captives. They mainly trade firearms,\r\napparently some kind of flintlocks, and powder.\"\r\n\r\nThen they were confining their operations to unpenetrated time lines;\r\nthere had been no reports of firearms in the hands of the Croutha\r\ninvaders.\r\n\r\n\"After they buy a batch of slaves,\" Skordran Kirv continued, \"they\r\ntranspose them to this presumably Fifth Level base, where they have\r\nconcentration camps. The slaves we questioned had been airlifted to\r\nNorth America, where there's another concentration camp, and from\r\nthere transposed to this Esaron Sector time line where I found them.\r\nThey say that there were at least two to three thousand slaves in\r\nthis North American concentration camp and that they are being\r\ntransposed out in small batches and replaced by others airlifted in\r\nfrom India. This lot was sold to a Calera named Nebu-hin-Abenoz, the\r\nchieftain of a hill town, Careba, about fifty miles south-west of the\r\nplantation. There were two hundred and fifty in this batch; this\r\nCoru-hin-Irigod only bought the batch he sold at the plantation.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe aircar lost speed and altitude; below, the countryside was dotted\r\nwith conveyer heads, each spatially coexistent with some outtime\r\npolice post or operation. There were a great many of them; the western\r\ncoast of North America was a center of civilization on many\r\nparatemporal sectors, and while the conveyer heads of the commercial\r\nand passenger companies were scattered over hundreds of Fifth Level\r\ntime lines, those of the Paratime Police were concentrated upon one.\r\nThe anti-grav-car circled around a three-hundred-foot steel tower that\r\nsupported a conveyer head spatially coexistent with one on a top floor\r\nof some outtime tall building, and let down in front of a low\r\nprefabricated steel shed. A man in police uniform came out to meet\r\nthem. There was a fifty-foot conveyer dome inside, and a fifty-foot\r\nred-lined circle that marked the transposition point of an outtime\r\nconveyer. They all entered the dome, and the operator put on the\r\ntransposition field.\r\n\r\n\"You haven't heard the worst of it yet.\" Skordran Kirv was saying. \"On\r\nthis time line, we have reason to think that the native,\r\nNebu-hin-Abenoz, who bought the slaves, actually saw the slavers'\r\nconveyer. Maybe even saw it activated.\"\r\n\r\n\"If he did, we'll either have to capture him and give him a\r\nmemory-obliteration, or kill him,\" Vall said. \"What do you know about\r\nhim?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, this Careba, the town he bosses, is a little walled town up in\r\nthe hills. Everybody there is related to everybody else; this man we\r\nhave, Coru-hin-Irigod, is the son of a sister of Nebu-hin-Abenoz's\r\nwife. They're all bandits and slavers and cattle rustlers and what\r\nhave you. For the last ten years, Nebu-hin-Abenoz has been buying\r\nslaves from some secret source. Before the Kholghoor Sector people\r\nbegan coming in, they were mostly white, with a few brown people who\r\nmight have been Polynesians. No Negroes--there's no black race on this\r\nsector, and I suppose the paratime slavers didn't want too many\r\nquestions asked. Coru-hin-Irigod, under narco-hypnosis, said that they\r\nwere all outlanders, speaking strange languages.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ten years! And this is the first hint we've had of it,\" Vall said.\r\n\"That's not a bright mark for any of us. I'll bet the slave population\r\non some of these Esaron time lines is an anthropologist's nightmare.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, if this has been going on for ten years, there must have been\r\nmillions upon millions of people dragged from their own time lines\r\ninto slavery!\" Dalla said in a shocked voice.\r\n\r\n\"Ten years may not be all of it,\" Vall said. \"This Nebu-hin-Abenoz\r\nlooks like the only tangible lead we have, at present. How does he\r\noperate?\"\r\n\r\n\"About once every ten days, he'll take ten or fifteen men and go a\r\nday's ride--that may be as much as fifty miles; these Caleras have\r\ngood horses and they're hard riders--into the hills. He'll take a big\r\nbag of money, all gold. After dark, when he has made camp, a couple of\r\nstrangers in Calera dress will come in. He'll go off with them, and\r\nafter about an hour, he'll come back with eight or ten of these\r\nstrangers and a couple of hundred slaves, always chained in batches of\r\nten. Nebu-hin-Abenoz pays for them, makes arrangements for the next\r\nmeeting, and the next morning he and his party start marching the\r\nslaves to Careba. I might add that, until now, these slaves have been\r\nsold to the mines east of Careba; these are the first that have gotten\r\ninto the coastal country.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's why this hasn't come to light before, then. The conveyer comes\r\nin every ten days, at about the same place?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I've been thinking of a way we might trap them,\" Skordran Kirv\r\nsaid. \"I'll need more men, and equipment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Order them from Regional or General Reserve.\" Vall told him. \"This\r\nthing's going to have overtop priority till it's cleared up.\"\r\n\r\nHe was mentally cursing Vulthor Tharn's procedure-bound timidity as\r\nthe conveyer flickered and solidified around them and the overhead red\r\nlight turned green.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey emerged into the interior of a long shed, adobe-walled and\r\nthatch-roofed, with small barred windows set high above the earth\r\nfloor. It was cool and shadowy, and the air was heavy with the\r\nfragrance of citrus fruits. There were bins along the walls, some\r\npartly full of oranges, and piles of wicker baskets. Another conveyer\r\ndome stood beside the one in which they had arrived; two men in white\r\ncloaks and riding boots sat on the edge of one of the bins, smoking\r\nand talking.\r\n\r\nSkordran Kirv introduced them--Gathon Dard and Krador Arv, special\r\ndetectives--and asked if anything new had come up. Krador Arv shook\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\n\"We still have about forty to go,\" he said. \"Nothing new in their\r\nstories; still the same two time lines.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration:]\r\n\r\n\"These people,\" Skordran Kirv explained, \"were all peons on the estate\r\nof a Kharanda noble just above the big bend of the Ganges. The Croutha\r\nhit their master's estate about a ten-days ago, elapsed time. In\r\ntelling about their capture, most of them say that their master's wife\r\nkilled herself with a dagger after the Croutha killed her husband,\r\nbut about one out of ten say that she was kidnaped by the Croutha. Two\r\ndifferent time lines, of course. The ones who tell the suicide story\r\nsaw no firearms among the Croutha; the ones who tell the kidnap story\r\nsay that they all had some kind of muskets and pistols. We're making\r\nsynthetic summaries of the two stories.\"\r\n\r\n\"We're having trouble with the locals about all these strangers coming\r\nin,\" Gathon Dard added. \"They're getting curious.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll have to take a chance on that,\" Vall said. \"Are the\r\ninterrogations still going on? Then let's have a look-in at them.\"\r\n\r\nThe big double doors at the end of the shed were barred on the inside.\r\nKrador Arv unlocked a small side door, letting Vall, Dalla and Gathon\r\nDard out. In the yard outside, a gang of slaves were unloading a big\r\nwagon of oranges and packing them into hampers; they were guarded by a\r\ncouple of native riflemen who seemed mostly concerned with keeping\r\nthem away from the shed, and a man in a white cloak was watching the\r\nguards for the same purpose. He walked over and introduced himself to\r\nVall.\r\n\r\n\"Golzan Doth, local alias Dosu Golan. I'm Consolidated Outtime\r\nFoodstuffs' manager here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nasty business for you people,\" Vall sympathized. \"If it's any\r\nconsolation, it's a bigger headache for us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you any idea what's going to be done about these slaves?\"\r\nGolzan Doth asked. \"I have to remember that the Company has forty\r\nthousand Paratemporal Exchange Units invested in them. The top office\r\nwas very specific in requesting information about that.\"\r\n\r\nVall shook his head. \"That's over my echelon,\" he said. \"Have to be\r\ndecided by the Paratime Commission. I doubt if your company'll suffer.\r\nYou bought them innocently, in conformity with local custom. Ever buy\r\nslaves from this Coru-hin-Irigod before?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm new, here. The man I'm replacing broke his neck when his horse\r\nput a foot in a gopher hole about two ten-days ago.\"\r\n\r\nBeside him, Vall could see Dalla nod as though making a mental note.\r\nWhen she got back to Home Time Line, she'd put a crew of mediums to\r\nwork trying to contact the discarnate former plantation manager; at\r\nRhogom Institute, she had been working on the problem of return of a\r\ndiscarnate personality from outtime.\r\n\r\n\"A few times,\" Skordran Kirv said. \"Nothing suspicious; all local\r\nstuff. We questioned Coru-hin-Irigod pretty closely on that point, and\r\nhe says that this is the first time he ever brought a batch of\r\nNebu-hin-Abenoz's outlanders this far west.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe interrogations were being conducted inside the plantation house,\r\nin the secret central rooms where the paratimers lived. Skordran Kirv\r\nused a door-activator to slide open a hidden door.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose I don't have to warn either of you that any positive\r\nstatement made in the hearing of a narco-hypnotized subject--\" he\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\n\"... Has the effect of hypnotic suggestion--\" Vall picked up after\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"... And should be avoided unless such suggestion is intended,\" Dalla\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\nSkordran Kirv laughed, opening another, inner door, and stood aside.\r\nIn what had been the paratimers' recreation room, most of the\r\nfurniture had been shoved into the corners. Four small tables had been\r\nset up, widely spaced and with screens between; across each of them,\r\nwith an electric recorder between, an almost naked Kharanda slave\r\nfaced a Paratime Police psychist. At a long table at the far side of\r\nthe room, four men and two girls were working over stacks of cards and\r\ntwo big charts.\r\n\r\n\"Phrakor Vuln,\" the man who was working on the charts introduced\r\nhimself. \"Synthesist.\" He introduced the others.\r\n\r\nVall made a point of the fact that Dalla was his wife, in case any of\r\nthe cops began to get ideas, and mentioned that she spoke Kharanda,\r\nhad spent some time on the Fourth Level Kholghoor, and was a qualified\r\npsychist.\r\n\r\n\"What have you got, so far?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Two different time lines, and two different gangs of Wizard\r\nTraders,\" Phrakor Vuln said. \"We've established the latter from\r\nphysical descriptions and because both batches were sold by the\r\nCroutha at equivalent periods of elapsed time.\"\r\n\r\nVall picked up one of the kidnap-story cards and glanced at it.\r\n\r\n\"I notice there's a fair verbal description of these firearms, and\r\nmention of electric whips,\" he said. \"I'm curious about where they\r\ncame from.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, this is how we reconstructed them, Chief's Assistant,\" one of\r\nthe girls said, handing him a couple of sheets of white drawing paper.\r\n\r\nThe sketches had been done with soft pencil; they bore repeated\r\nerasures and corrections. That of the whip showed a cylindrical\r\nhandle, indicated as twelve inches in length and one in diameter,\r\nfitted with a thumb-switch.\r\n\r\n\"That's definitely Second Level Khiftan,\" Vall said, handing it back.\r\n\"Made of braided copper or silver wire and powered with a little\r\nnuclear-conversion battery in the grip. They heat up to about two\r\nhundred centigrade; produce really painful burns.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, that's beastly!\" Dalla exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Anything on the Khiftan Sector is.\" Skordran Kirv looked at the four\r\nslaves at the tables. \"We don't have a really bad case here, now. A\r\nfew of these people were lash-burned horribly, though.\"\r\n\r\nVall was looking at the other sketches. One was a musket, with a wide\r\nbutt and a band-fastened stock; the lock-mechanism, vaguely flintlock,\r\nhad been dotted in tentatively. The other was a long pistol, similarly\r\ndefinite in outline and vague in mechanical detail; it was merely a\r\nknob-butted miniature of the musket.\r\n\r\n\"I've seen firearms like these; have a lot of them in my collection,\"\r\nhe said, handing back the sketches. \"Low-order mechanical or\r\nhigh-order pre-mechanical cultures. Fact is, things like those could\r\nhave been made on the Kholghoor Sector, if the Kharandas had learned\r\nto combine sulfur, carbon and nitrates to make powder.\"\r\n\r\nThe interrogator at one of the tables had evidently heard all his\r\nsubject could tell him. He rose, motioning the slave to stand.\r\n\r\n\"Now, go with that man,\" he said in Kharanda, motioning to one of the\r\ndetectives in native guard uniform. \"You will trust him; he is your\r\nfriend and will not harm you. When you have left this room, you will\r\nforget everything that has happened here, except that you were kindly\r\ntreated and that you were given wine to drink and your hurts were\r\nanointed. You will tell the others that we are their friends and that\r\nthey have nothing to fear from us. And you will not try to remove the\r\nmark from the back of your left hand.\"\r\n\r\nAs the detective led the slave out a door at the other side of the\r\nroom, the psychist came over to the long table, handing over a card\r\nand lighting a cigarette.\r\n\r\n\"Suicide story,\" he said to one of the girls, who took the card.\r\n\r\n\"Anything new?\"\r\n\r\n\"Some minor details about the sale to the Caleras on this time line. I\r\nthink we've about scraped bottom.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can't say that,\" Phrakor Vuln objected. \"The very last one may\r\ngive us something nobody else had noticed.\"\r\n\r\nAnother subject was sent out. The interrogator came over to the table.\r\n\r\n\"One of the kidnap-story crowd,\" he said. \"This one was right beside\r\nthat Croutha who took the shot at the wild pig or whatever it was on\r\nthe way to the Wizard Traders' camp. Best description of the guns\r\nwe've gotten so far. No question that they're flintlocks.\" He saw\r\nVerkan Vall. \"Oh, hello, Assistant Verkan. What do you make of them?\r\nYou're an authority on outtime weapons, I understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd have to see them. These people simply don't think mechanically\r\nenough to give a good description. A lot of peoples make flintlock\r\nfirearms.\"\r\n\r\nHe started running over, in his mind, the paratemporal areas in which\r\ngunpowder but not the percussion-cap was known. Expanding cultures,\r\nwhich had progressed as far as the former but not the latter. Static\r\ncultures, in which an accidental discovery of gunpowder had never been\r\nfollowed up by further research. Post-debacle cultures, in which a few\r\nstray bits of ancient knowledge had survived.\r\n\r\nAnother interrogator came over, and then the fourth. For a while they\r\nsat and talked and drank coffee, and then the next quartet of slaves,\r\ntwo men and two women, were brought in. One of the women had been\r\nbadly blistered by the electric whips of the Wizard Traders; in spite\r\nof reassurances, all were visibly apprehensive.\r\n\r\n\"We will not harm you,\" one of the psychists told them. \"Here; here is\r\nmedicine for your hurts. At first, it will sting, as good medicines\r\nwill, but soon it will take away all pain. And here is wine for you to\r\ndrink.\"\r\n\r\nA couple of detectives approached, making a great show of pouring wine\r\nand applying ointment; under cover of the medication, they jabbed each\r\nslave with a hypodermic needle, and then guided them to seats at the\r\nfour tables. Vall and Dalla went over and stood behind one of the\r\npsychists, who had a small flashlight in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Now, rest for a while,\" the psychist was saying. \"Rest and let the\r\ngood medicine do its work. You are tired and sleepy. Look at this\r\nmagic light, which brings comfort to the troubled. Look at the light.\r\nLook ... at ... the ... light.\"\r\n\r\nThey moved to the next table.\r\n\r\n\"Did you have hand in the fighting?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, lord. We were peasant folk, not fighting people. We had no\r\nweapons, nor weapon-skill. Those who fought were all killed; we held\r\nup empty hands, and were spared to be captives of the Croutha.\"\r\n\r\n\"What happened to your master, the Lord Ghromdour, and to his lady?\"\r\n\r\n\"One of the Croutha threw a hatchet and killed our master, and then\r\nhis lady drew a dagger and killed herself.\"\r\n\r\nThe psychist made a red mark on the card in front of him, and circled\r\nthe number on the back of the slave's hand with red indelible crayon.\r\nVall and Dalla went to the third table.\r\n\r\n\"They had the common weapons of the Croutha, lord, and they also had\r\nthe weapons of the Wizard Traders. Of these, they carried the long\r\nweapons slung across their backs, and the short weapons thrust through\r\ntheir belts.\"\r\n\r\nA blue mark on the card; a blue circle on the back of the slave's\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nThey listened to both versions of what had happened at the sack of the\r\nLord Ghromdour's estate, and the march into the captured city of\r\nJhirda, and the second march into the forest to the camp of the Wizard\r\nTraders.\r\n\r\n\"The servants of the Wizard Traders did not appear until after the\r\nCroutha had gone away; they wore different garb. They wore short\r\njackets, and trousers, and short boots, and they carried small weapons\r\non their belts--\"\r\n\r\n\"They had whips of great cruelty that burned like fire; we were all\r\nlashed with these whips, as you may see, lord--\"\r\n\r\n\"The Croutha had bound us two and two, with neck-yokes; these the\r\nservants of the Wizard Traders took off from us, and they chained us\r\ntogether by tens, with the chains we still wore when we came to this\r\nplace--\"\r\n\r\n\"They killed my child, my little Zhouzha!\" the woman with the horribly\r\nblistered back was wailing. \"They tore her out of my arms, and one of\r\nthe servants of the Wizard Traders--may Khokhaat devour his soul\r\nforever!--dashed out her brains. And when I struggled to save her. I\r\nwas thrown on the ground, and beaten with the fire-whips until I\r\nfainted. Then I was dragged into the forest, along with the others who\r\nwere chained with me.\" She buried her head in her arms, sobbing\r\nbitterly.\r\n\r\nDalla stepped forward, taking the flashlight from the interrogator\r\nwith one hand and lifting the woman's head with the other. She flashed\r\nthe light quickly in the woman's eyes.\r\n\r\n\"You will grieve no more for your child,\" she said. \"Already, you are\r\nforgetting what happened at the Wizard Traders' camp, and remembering\r\nonly that your child is safe from harm. Soon you will remember her\r\nonly as a dream of the child you hope to have, some day.\" She flashed\r\nthe light again, then handed it back to the psychist. \"Now, tell us\r\nwhat happened when you were taken into the forest; what did you see\r\nthere?\"\r\n\r\nThe psychist nodded approvingly, made a note on the card, and\r\nlistened while the woman spoke. She had stopped sobbing, now, and her\r\nvoice was clear and cheerful.\r\n\r\nVall went over to the long table.\r\n\r\n\"Those slaves were still chained with the Wizard Traders' chains when\r\nthey were delivered here. Where are the chains?\" he asked Skordran\r\nKirv.\r\n\r\n\"In the permanent conveyer room,\" Skordran Kirv said. \"You can look at\r\nthem there; we didn't want to bring them in here, for fear these poor\r\ndevils would think we were going to chain them again. They're very\r\nlight, very strong; some kind of alloy steel. Files and power saws\r\nonly polish them; it takes fifteen seconds to cut a link with an\r\natomic torch. One long chain, and short lengths, fifteen inches long,\r\nstaggered, every three feet, with a single hinge-shackle for the\r\nankle. The shackles were riveted with soft wrought-iron rivets,\r\nevidently made with some sort of a power riveting-machine. We cut them\r\neasily with a cold chisel.\"\r\n\r\n\"They ought to be sent to Dhergabar Equivalent, Police Terminal, for\r\nstudy of material and workmanship. Now, you mentioned some scheme you\r\nhad for capturing this conveyer that brings in the slaves for\r\nNebu-hin-Abenoz. What have you in mind?\"\r\n\r\n\"We still have Coru-hin-Irigod and all his gang, under hypno. I'd\r\nthought of giving them hypnotic conditioning, and sending them back to\r\nCareba with orders to put out some kind of signal the next time\r\nNebu-hin-Abenoz starts out on a buying trip. We could have a couple of\r\nmen posted in the hills overlooking Careba, and they could send a\r\nmessage-ball through to Police Terminal. Then, a party could be sent\r\nwith a mobile conveyer to ambush Nebu-hin-Abenoz on the way, and wipe\r\nout his party. Our people could take their horses and clothing and go\r\non to take the conveyer by surprise.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd suggest one change. Instead of relying on visual signals by the\r\nhypno-conditioned Coru-hin-Irigod, send a couple of our men to Careba\r\nwith midget radios.\"\r\n\r\nSkordran Kirv nodded. \"Sure. We can condition Coru-hin-Irigod to\r\naccept them as friends and vouch for them at Careba. Our boys can be\r\ntraders and slave buyers. Careba's a market town; traders are always\r\nwelcome. They can have firearms to sell--revolvers and repeating\r\nrifles. Any Calera'll buy any firearm that's better than the one he's\r\ncarrying; they'll always buy revolvers and repeaters. We can get what\r\nwe want from Commercial Four-Oh-Seven; we can get riding and pack\r\nhorses here.\"\r\n\r\nVall nodded. \"And the post overlooking or in radio range of Careba on\r\nthis time line, and another on PolTerm. For the ambush of\r\nNebu-hin-Abenoz's gang and the capture of the conveyer, use anything you\r\nwant to--sleep-gas, paralyzers, energy-weapons, antigrav-equipment,\r\nanything. As far as regulations about using only equipment appropriate\r\nto local culture-levels, forget them entirely. But take that conveyer\r\nintact. You can locate the base time line from the settings of the\r\ninstrument panel, and that's what we want most of all.\"\r\n\r\nDalla and the police psychist, having finished with and dismissed\r\ntheir subject, came over to the long table.\r\n\r\n\"... That poor creature,\" Dalla was saying. \"What sort of fiends are\r\nthey?\"\r\n\r\n\"If that made you sick, remember we've been listening to things like\r\nthat for the last eight hours. Some of the stories were even worse\r\nthan that one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'd like to use a heat-gun on the whole lot of them, turned\r\ndown to where it'd just fry them medium-rare,\" Dalla said. \"And for\r\nwhoever's back of this, take him to Second Level Khiftan and sell him\r\nto the priests of Fasif.\"\r\n\r\n\"Too bad you're not coming back from your vacation, instead of\r\nstarting out. Chief's Assistant Verkan,\" Skordran Kirv said. \"This is\r\ntoo big for me to handle alone, and I'd sooner work under you than\r\nanybody else Chief Tortha sends in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Vall!\" Dalla cried in indignation. \"You're not going to just report\r\non this and then walk away from it, are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"But, darling,\" Vall replied, in what he hoped was a convincing show\r\nof surprise. \"You don't want our vacation postponed again, do you? If\r\nI get mixed up in this, there's no telling when I can get away, and by\r\nthe time I'm free, something may come up at Rhogom Institute that you\r\nwon't want to drop--\"\r\n\r\n\"Vall, you know perfectly well that I wouldn't be happy for an instant\r\non the Dwarma Sector, thinking about this--\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, then; let's forget about the vacation. You want to stay on\r\nfor a while and help me with this? It'll be a lot of hard work, but\r\nwe'll be together.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, of course. I want to do something to smash those devils. Vall,\r\nif you'd heard some of the things they did to those poor people--\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll have to go back to PolTerm, as soon as I'm reasonably well\r\nfilled in on this, and report to Tortha Karf and tell him I've taken\r\ncharge. You can stay here and help with these interrogations; I'll be\r\nback in about ten hours. Then, we can go to Kholghoor East India\r\nSecReg HQ to talk to Ranthar Jard. We may be able to get something\r\nthat'll help us on that end--\"\r\n\r\n\"You may be able to have your vacation before too long, Dr. Hadron,\"\r\nSkordran Kirv told her. \"Once we capture one of their conveyers, the\r\ninstrument panel'll tell us what time line they're working from, and\r\nthen we'll have them.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's an Indo-Turanian Sector parable about a snake charmer who\r\nthought he was picking up his snake and found that he had hold of an\r\nelephant's tail,\" Vall said. \"That might be a good thing to bear in\r\nmind, till we find out just what we have picked up.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration:]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nComing down a hallway on the hundred and seventh floor of the\r\nManagement wing of the Paratime Building, Yandar Yadd paused to\r\nadmire, in the green mirror of the glassoid wall, the jaunty angle of\r\nhis silver-feathered cap, the fit of his short jacket, and the way his\r\nweapon hung at his side. This last was not instantly recognizable as a\r\nweapon; it looked more like a portable radio, which indeed it was. It\r\nwas, none the less, a potent weapon. One flick of his finger could\r\nconnect that radio with one at Tri-Planet News Service, and within the\r\nhour anything he said into it would be heard by all Terra, Mars and\r\nVenus. In consequence, there existed around the Paratime Building a\r\nmarked and understandable reluctance to antagonize Yandar Yadd.\r\n\r\nHe glanced at his watch. It was twenty minutes short of 1000, when he\r\nhad an appointment with Baltan Vrath, the comptroller general.\r\nGlancing about, he saw that he was directly in front of the doorway of\r\nthe Outtime Claims Bureau, and he strolled in, walking through the\r\nwaiting room and into the claims-presentation office. At once, he\r\nstiffened like a bird dog at point.\r\n\r\nSphabron Larv, one of his young legmen, was in altercation across the\r\ncounter-desk with Varkar Klav, the Deputy Claims Agent on duty at the\r\ntime. Varkar was trying to be icily dignified; Sphabron Larv's black\r\nhair was in disarray and his face was suffused with anger. He was\r\npounding with his fist on the plastic counter-top.\r\n\r\n\"You have to!\" he was yelling in the older man's face. \"That's a\r\npublic document, and I have a right to see it. You want me to go into\r\nTribunes' Court and get an order? If I do, there'll be a Question in\r\nCouncil about why I had to, before the day's out!\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter, Larv?\" Yandar Yadd asked lazily. \"He trying to\r\nhold something out on you?\"\r\n\r\nSphabron Larv turned; his eyes lit happily when he saw his boss, and\r\nthen his anger returned.\r\n\r\n\"I want to see a copy of an indemnity claim that was filed this\r\nmorning,\" he said. \"Varkar, here, won't show it to me. What does he\r\nthink this is, a Fourth Level dictatorship?\"\r\n\r\n\"What kind of a claim, now?\" Yandar Yadd addressed Larv, ignoring\r\nVarkar Klav.\r\n\r\n\"Consolidated Outtime Foodstuffs--one of the Thalvan Interests\r\ncompanies--just claimed forty thousand P.E.U. for a hundred slaves\r\nbought by one of their plantation managers on Third Level Esaron from\r\na local slave dealer. The Paratime Police impounded the slaves for\r\nnarco-hypnotic interrogation, and then transposed the lot of them to\r\nPolice Terminal.\"\r\n\r\nYandar Yadd still held his affectation of sleepy indolence.\r\n\r\n\"Now why would the Paracops do that, I wonder? Slavery's an\r\nestablished local practice on Esaron Sector; our people have to buy\r\nslaves if they want to run a plantation.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know that.\" Sphabron Larv replied. \"That's what I want to find out.\r\nThere must be something wrong, either with the slaves, or the\r\ntreatment our people were giving them, or the Paratime Police, and I\r\nwant to find out which.\"\r\n\r\n\"To tell the truth, Larv, so do I.\" Yandar Yadd said. He turned to the\r\nman behind the counter. \"Varkar, do we see that claim, or do I make a\r\nstory out of your refusal to show it?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"The Paratime Police asked me to keep this confidential,\" Varkar Klav\r\nsaid. \"Publicity would seriously hamper an important police\r\ninvestigation.\"\r\n\r\nYandar Yadd made an impolite noise. \"How do I know that all it would\r\ndo would be to reveal police incompetence?\" he retorted. \"Look,\r\nVarkar; you and the Paratime Police and the Paratime Commission and\r\nthe Home Time Line Management are all hired employees of the Home Time\r\nLine public. The public has a right to know what its employees are\r\ndoing, and it's my business to see that they're informed. Now, for the\r\nlast time--will you show us a copy of that claim?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, let me explain, off the record--\" the official begged.\r\n\r\n\"Huh-uh! Huh-uh! I had that off-the-record gag worked on me when I was\r\nabout Larv's age, fifty years ago. Anything I get, I put on the air or\r\nnot at my own discretion.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" Varkar Klav surrendered, pointing to a reading screen and\r\ntwiddling a knob. \"But when you read it, I hope you have enough\r\ndiscretion to keep quiet about it.\"\r\n\r\nThe screen lit, and Yandar Yadd automatically pressed a button for a\r\nphoto-copy. The two newsmen stared for a moment, and then even Yandar\r\nYadd's shell of drowsy negligence cracked and fell from him. His hand\r\nbrushed the switch as he snatched the hand-phone from his belt.\r\n\r\n\"Marva!\" he barked, before the girl at the news office could more than\r\nacknowledge. \"Get this recorded for immediate telecast!... Ready?\r\nBeginning: The existence of a huge paratemporal slave trade came to\r\nlight on the afternoon of One-Five-Nine Day, on a time line of the\r\nThird Level Esaron Sector, when Field Agent Skordran Kirv, Paratime\r\nPolice, discovered, at an orange plantation of Consolidated Outtime\r\nFoodstuffs--\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSalgath Trod sat alone in his private office, his half-finished lunch\r\ngrowing cold on the desk in front of him as he watched the teleview\r\nscreen across the room, tuned to a pickup behind the Speaker's chair\r\nin the Executive Council Chamber ten stories below. The two thousand\r\nseats had been almost all empty at 1000, when Council had convened.\r\nFifteen minutes later, the news had broken; now, at 1430, a good three\r\nquarters of the seats were occupied. He could see, in the aisles, the\r\ngold-plated robot pages gliding back and forth, receiving and\r\ndelivering messages. One had just slid up to the seat of Councilman\r\nHasthor Flan, and Hasthor was speaking urgently into the recorder\r\nmouthpiece. Another message for him, he supposed; he'd gotten at least\r\na score such calls since the crisis had developed.\r\n\r\nPeople were going to start wondering, he thought. This situation should\r\nhave been perfect for his purposes; as leader of the Opposition he could\r\neasily make himself the next General Manager, if he exploited this\r\nscandal properly. He listened for a while to the Centrist-Management\r\nmember who was speaking; he could rip that fellow's arguments to shreds\r\nin a hundred words--but he didn't dare. The Management was taking\r\nexactly the line Salgath Trod wanted the whole Council to take: treat\r\nthis affair as an isolated and extraordinary occurrence, find a couple\r\nof convenient scapegoats, cobble up some explanation acceptable to the\r\npublic, and forget it. He wondered what had happened to the imbecile who\r\nhad transposed those Kholghoor Sector slaves onto an exploited time\r\nline. Ought to be shanghaied to the Khiftan Sector and sold to the\r\npriests of Fasif!\r\n\r\nA buzzer sounded, and for an instant he thought it would be the\r\nmessage he had seen Hasthor Fan recording. Then he realized that it\r\nwas the buzzer for the private door, which could only be operated by\r\nsomeone with a special identity sign. He pressed a button and unlocked\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\nThe young man in the loose wrap-around tunic who entered was a\r\nstranger. At least, his face and his voice were strange, but voices\r\ncould be mechanically altered, and a skilled cosmetician could render\r\nany face unrecognizable. He looked like a student, or a minor\r\ncommercial executive, or an engineer, or something like that. Of\r\ncourse, his tunic bulged slightly under the left armpit, but even the\r\nmost respectable tunics showed occasional weapon-bulges.\r\n\r\n\"Good afternoon, councilman,\" the newcomer said, sitting down across\r\nthe desk from Salgath Trod. \"I was just talking to ... somebody we\r\nboth know.\"\r\n\r\nSalgath Trod offered cigarettes, lighted his visitor's and then his\r\nown.\r\n\r\n\"What does Our Mutual Friend think about all this?\" he asked,\r\ngesturing toward the screen.\r\n\r\n\"Our Mutual Friend isn't at all happy about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think, perhaps, that I'm bursting into wild huzzas?\" Salgath Trod\r\nasked. \"If I were to act as everybody expects me to, I'd be down there\r\non the floor, now, clawing into the Management tooth and nail. All my\r\nadherents are wondering why I'm not. So are all my opponents, and\r\nbefore long one of them is going to guess the reason.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, why not go down?\" the stranger asked. \"Our Mutual Friend thinks\r\nit would be an excellent idea. The leak couldn't be stopped, and it's\r\ngone so far already that the Management will never be able to play it\r\ndown. So the next best thing is to try to exploit it.\"\r\n\r\nSalgath Trod smiled mirthlessly. \"So I am to get in front of it, and\r\nlead it in the right direction? Fine ... as long as I don't stumble\r\nover something. If I do, it'll go over me like a Fifth Level\r\nbison-herd.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry about that,\" the stranger laughed reassuringly. \"There\r\nare others on the floor who are also friends of Our Mutual Friend.\r\nHere: what you'd better do is attack the Paratime Police, especially\r\nTortha Karf and Verkan Vall. Accuse them of negligence and\r\nincompetence, and, by implication, of collusion, and demand a special\r\ncommittee to investigate. And try to get a motion for a confidence\r\nvote passed. A motion to censure the Management, say--\"\r\n\r\nSalgath Trod nodded. \"It would delay things, at least. And if Our\r\nMutual Friend can keep properly covered, I might be able to overturn\r\nthe Management.\" He looked at the screen again. \"That old fool of a\r\nNanthav is just getting started; it'll be an hour before I could get\r\nrecognized. Plenty of time to get a speech together. Something short\r\nand vicious--\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll have to be careful. It won't do, with your political record,\r\nto try to play down these stories of a gigantic criminal conspiracy.\r\nThat's too close to the Management line. And at the same time, you\r\nwant to avoid saying anything that would get Verkan Vall and Tortha\r\nKarf started off on any new lines of investigation.\"\r\n\r\nSalgath Trod nodded. \"Just depend on me; I'll handle it.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the stranger had gone, he shut off the sound reception, relying\r\non visual dumb-show to keep him informed of what was going on on the\r\nCouncil floor. He didn't like the situation. It was too easy to say\r\nthe wrong thing. If only he knew more about the shadowy figures whose\r\nmessengers used his private door--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCoru-hin-Irigod held his aching head in both hands, as though he were\r\nafraid it would fall apart, and blinked in the sunlight from the\r\nwindow. Lord Safar, how much of that sweet brandy had he drunk, last\r\nnight? He sat on the edge of the bed for a moment, trying to think.\r\nThen, suddenly apprehensive, he thrust his hand under his pillow. The\r\nheavy four-barreled pistols were there, all right, but--_The money!_\r\n\r\nHe rummaged frantically among the bedding, and among his clothes,\r\npiled on the floor, but the leather bag was nowhere to be found. Two\r\nthousand gold _obus_, the price of a hundred slaves. He snatched up\r\none of the pistols, his headache forgotten. Then he laughed and tossed\r\nthe pistol down again. Of course! He'd given the bag to the plantation\r\nmanager, what was his outlandish name, Dosu Golan, to keep for him\r\nbefore the drinking bout had begun. It was safely waiting for him in\r\nthe plantation strong box. Well, nothing like a good scare to make a\r\nman forget a brandy head, anyhow. And there was something else,\r\nsomething very nice--\r\n\r\nOh, yes, there it was, beside the bed. He picked up the beautiful\r\ngleaming repeater, pulled down the lever far enough to draw the\r\ncartridge halfway out of the chamber, and closed it again, lowering\r\nthe hammer. Those two Jeseru traders from the North, what were their\r\nnames? Ganadara and Atarazola. That was a stroke of luck, meeting them\r\nhere. They'd given him this lovely rifle, and they were going to\r\naccompany him and his men back to Careba; they had a hundred such\r\nrifles, and two hundred six-shot revolvers, and they wanted to trade\r\nfor slaves. The Lord Safar bless them both, wouldn't they be welcome\r\nat Careba!\r\n\r\nHe looked at the sunlight falling through the window on the still\r\nrecumbent form of his companion, Faru-hin-Obaran. Outside, he could\r\nhear the sounds of the plantation coming to life--an ax thudding on\r\nwood, the clatter of pans from the kitchens. Crossing to\r\nFaru-hin-Obaran's bed, he grasped the sleeper by the ankle, tugging.\r\n\r\n\"Waken, Faru!\" he shouted. \"Get up and clear the fumes from your head!\r\nWe start back to Careba today!\"\r\n\r\nFaru swore groggily and pushed himself into a sitting position,\r\nfumbling on the floor for his trousers.\r\n\r\n\"What day's this?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"The day after we went to bed, ninny!\" Then Coru-hin-Irigod wrinkled\r\nhis brow. He could remember, clearly enough, the sale of the slaves,\r\nbut after that--Oh, well, he'd been drinking; it would all come back\r\nto him, after a while.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVerkan Vall rubbed his hand over his face wearily, started to light\r\nanother cigarette, and threw it across the room in disgust. What he\r\nneeded was a drink--a long drink of cool, tart white wine, laced with\r\nbrandy--and then he needed to sleep.\r\n\r\n\"We're absolutely nowhere!\" Ranthar Jard said. \"Of course they're\r\noperating on time lines we've never penetrated. The fact that they're\r\nsupplying the Croutha with guns proves that; there isn't a firearm on\r\nany of the time lines our people are legitimately exploiting. And\r\nthere are only about three billion time lines on this belt of the\r\nCroutha invasion--\"\r\n\r\n\"If we could think of a way to reduce it to some specific area of\r\nparatime--\" one of Ranthar Jard's deputies began.\r\n\r\n\"That's precisely what we've been trying to do, Klav,\" Vall said. \"We\r\nhaven't done it.\"\r\n\r\nDalla, who had withdrawn from the discussion and was on a couch at the\r\nside of the room, surrounded by reports and abstracts and summaries,\r\nlooked up.\r\n\r\n\"I took hours and hours of hypno-mech on Kholghoor Sector religions,\r\nbefore I went out on that wild-goose chase for psychokinesis and\r\nprecognition data,\" she said. \"About six or eight hundred years ago,\r\nthere were religious wars and heresies and religious schisms all over\r\nthe Kharanda country. No matter how uniform the Kholghoor Sector may\r\nbe otherwise, there are dozens and dozens of small belts and\r\nsub-sectors of different religions or sects or god-cults.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right,\" Ranthar Jard agreed, brightening. \"We have\r\nhagiologists who know all that stuff; we'll have a couple of them\r\ninterrogate those slaves. I don't know how much they can get out of\r\nthem--lot of peasants, won't be up on the theological niceties--but a\r\nsynthesis of what we get from the lot of them--\"\r\n\r\n\"That's an idea,\" Vall agreed. \"About the first idea we've had,\r\nhere--Oh, how about politics, too? Check on who's the king, what the\r\nstories about the royal family are, that sort of thing.\"\r\n\r\nRanthar Jard looked at the map on the wall. \"The Croutha have only\r\ngotten halfway to Nharkan, here. Say we transpose detectives in at\r\nnight on some of these time lines we think are promising, and check\r\nup at the tax-collection offices on a big landowner north of Jhirda\r\nnamed Ghromdour? That might get us something.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't want you to think we're trying to get out of work,\r\nChief's Assistant,\" one of the deputies said, \"but is there any real\r\nnecessity for our trying to locate the Wizard Trader time lines? If\r\nyou can get them from the Esaron Sector, it'll be the same, won't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Marv, in this business you never depend on just one lead,\" Ranthar\r\nJard told him. \"And beside, when Skordran Kirv's gang hits the base of\r\noperations in North America, there's no guarantee that they may not\r\nhave time to send off a radio warning to the crowd at the base here in\r\nIndia. We have to hit both places at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that, too,\" Vall said. \"But the main thing is to get these\r\nWizard Trader camps on the Kholghoor Sector cleaned out. How are you\r\nfixed for men and equipment, for a big raid, Jard?\"\r\n\r\nRanthar Jard shrugged. \"I can get about five hundred men with\r\nconveyers, including a couple of two-hundred-footers to carry\r\nairboats,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Not enough. Skordran Kirv has one complete armored brigade, one\r\nairborne infantry brigade, and an air cavalry regiment, with\r\nGhaldron-Hesthor equipment for a simultaneous transposition,\" Vall\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"Where in blazes did he get them all?\" Ranthar Jard demanded.\r\n\r\n\"They're guard troops, from Service Sector and Industrial Sector.\r\nWe'll get you the same sort of a force. I only hope we don't have\r\nanother Prole insurrection while they're away--\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, don't think I'm trying to argue policy with you,\" Ranthar Jard\r\nsaid, \"but that could raise a dreadful stink on Home Time Line.\r\nEspecially on top of this news-break about the slave trade.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll have to take a chance on that,\" Vall said. \"If you're worried\r\nabout what the book says, forget it. We're throwing the book away, on\r\nthis operation. Do you realize that this thing is a threat to the\r\nwhole Paratime Civilization?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I do,\" Ranthar Jard said. \"I know the doctrine of Paratime\r\nSecurity as well as you or anybody else. The question is, does the\r\npublic realize it?\"\r\n\r\nA buzzer sounded. Ranthar Jard pressed a switch on the intercom-box in\r\nfront of him and said: \"Ranthar here. Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Visiphone call, top urgency, just came in for Chief's Assistant\r\nVerkan, from Novilan Equivalent. Where can I put it through, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Here; booth seven.\" Ranthar Jard pointed across the room, nodding to\r\nVall. \"In just a moment.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGathon Dard and Antrath Alv--temporary local aliases, Ganadara and\r\nAtarazola--sat relaxed in their saddles, swaying to the motion of\r\ntheir horses. They wore the rust-brown hooded cloaks of the northern\r\nJeseru people, in sober contrast to the red and yellow and blue\r\nstriped robes and sun-bonnets of the Caleras in whose company they\r\nrode. They carried short repeating carbines in saddle scabbards, and\r\nheavy revolvers and long knives on their belts, and each led six\r\nheavily-laden pack-horses.\r\n\r\nCoru-hin-Irigod, riding beside Ganadara, pointed up the trail ahead.\r\n\r\n\"From up there,\" he said, speaking in Acalan, the lingua franca of the\r\nNorth American West Coast on that sector, \"we can see across the\r\nvalley to Careba. It will be an hour, as we ride, with the\r\npack-horses. Then we will rest, and drink wine, and feast.\"\r\n\r\nGanadara nodded. \"It was the guidance of our gods--and yours,\r\nCoru-hin-Irigod--that we met. Such slaves as you sold at the\r\noutlanders' plantation would bring a fine price in the North. The men\r\nare strong, and have the look of good field-workers; the women are\r\ncomely and well-formed. Though I fear that my wife would little relish\r\nit did I bring home such handmaidens.\"\r\n\r\nCoru-hin-Irigod laughed. \"For your wife, I will give you one of our\r\nriding whips.\" He leaned to the side, slashing at a cactus with his\r\nquirt. \"We in Careba have no trouble with our wives, about handmaidens\r\nor anything else.\"\r\n\r\n\"By Safar, if you doubt your welcome at Careba, wait till you show\r\nyour wares,\" another Calera said. \"Rifles and revolvers like those\r\ncome to our country seldom, and then old and battered, sold or stolen\r\nmany times before we see them. Rifles that fire seven times without\r\ntaking butt from shoulder!\" He invoked the name of the Great Lord\r\nSafar again.\r\n\r\nThe trail widened and leveled; they all came up abreast, with the\r\npack-horses strung out behind, and sat looking across the valley to\r\nthe adobe walls of the town that perched on the opposite ridge. After\r\na while, riders began dismounting and checking and tightening\r\nsaddle-girths; a couple of Caleras helped Ganadara and Atarazola\r\ninspect their pack-horses. When they remounted, Atarazola bowed his\r\nhead, lifting his left sleeve to cover his mouth, and muttered into it\r\nat some length. The Caleras looked at him curiously, and\r\nCoru-hin-Irigod inquired of Ganadara what he did.\r\n\r\n\"He prays,\" Ganadara said. \"He thanks our gods that we have lived to\r\nsee your town, and asks that we be spared to bring many more trains of\r\nrifles and ammunition up this trail.\"\r\n\r\nThe slaver nodded understandingly. The Caleras were a pious people,\r\ntoo, who believed in keeping on friendly terms with the gods.\r\n\r\n\"May Safar's hand work with the hands of your gods for it,\" he said,\r\nmaking what, to a non-Calera, would have been an extremely ribald\r\nsign.\r\n\r\n\"The gods watch over us,\" Atarazola said, lifting his head. \"They are\r\nnear us even now; they have spoken words of comfort in my ear.\"'\r\n\r\nGanadara nodded. The gods to whom his partner prayed were a couple of\r\nparatime policemen, crouching over a radio a mile or so down the\r\nridge.\r\n\r\n\"My brother,\" he told Coru-hin-Irigod, \"is much favored by our gods.\r\nMany people come to him to pray for them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. So you told me, now that I think on it.\" That detail had been\r\nincluded in the pseudo-memories he had been given under hypnosis. \"I\r\nserve Safar, as do all Caleras, but I have heard that the Jeserus'\r\ngods are good gods, dealing honestly with their servants.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn hour later, under the walls of the town, Coru-hin-Irigod drew one\r\nof his pistols and fired all four barrels in rapid succession into the\r\nair, shouting, \"Open! Open for Coru-hin-Irigod, and for the Jeseru\r\ntraders, Ganadara and Atarazola, who are with him!\"\r\n\r\nA head, black-bearded and sun-bonneted, appeared between the brick\r\nmerlons of the wall above the gate, shouted down a welcome, and then\r\nturned away to bawl orders. The gate slid aside, and, after the\r\ncaravan had passed through, naked slaves pushed the massive thing shut\r\nagain. Although they were familiar with the interior of the town, from\r\nphotographs taken with boomerang-balls--automatic-return transposition\r\nspheres like message-balls--they looked around curiously. The central\r\nsquare was thronged--Caleras in striped robes, people from the south\r\nand east in baggy trousers and embroidered shirts, mountaineers in\r\ndeerskins. A slave market was in progress, and some hundred-odd items\r\nof human merchandise were assembled in little groups, guarded by their\r\nowners and inspected by prospective buyers. They seemed to be all\r\nnatives of that geographic and paratemporal area.\r\n\r\n\"Don't even look at those,\" Coru-hin-Irigod advised. \"They are but\r\nculls; the market is almost over. We'll go to the house of\r\nNebu-hin-Abenoz, where all the considerable men gather, and you will\r\nfind those who will be able to trade slaves worthy of the goods you\r\nhave with you. Meanwhile, let my people take your horses and packs to\r\nmy house; you shall be my guests while you stay in Careba.\"\r\n\r\nIt was perfectly safe to trust Coru-hin-Irigod. He was a murderer and\r\na brigand and a slaver, but he would never incur the scorn of men and\r\nthe curse of the gods by dealing foully with a guest. The horses and\r\npacks were led away by his retainers; Ganadara and Atarazola pushed\r\ntheir horses after his and Faru-hin-Obaran's through the crowd.\r\n\r\nThe house of Nebu-hin-Abenoz, like every other building in Careba, was\r\nflat-roofed, adobe-walled and window-less except for narrow\r\nrifle-slits. The wide double-gate stood open, and five or six heavily\r\narmed Caleras lounged just inside. They greeted Coru and Faru by name,\r\nand the strangers by their assumed nationality. The four rode through,\r\ninto what appeared to be the stables, turning their horses over to\r\nslaves, who took them away. There were between fifty and sixty other\r\nhorses in the place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:]\r\n\r\nDivesting themselves of their weapons in an anteroom at the head of a\r\nflight of steps, they passed under an arch and into a wide, shady\r\npatio, where thirty or forty men stood about or squatted on piles of\r\ncushions, smoking cheroots, drinking from silver cups, talking in a\r\ncontinuous babel. Most of them were in Calera dress, though there were\r\nmen of other communities and nations, in other garb. As they moved\r\nacross the patio, Gathon Dard caught snatches of conversations about\r\ndeals in slaves, and horse trades, about bandit raids and blood feuds,\r\nabout women and horses and weapons.\r\n\r\nAn old man with a white beard and an unusually clean robe came over to\r\nintercept them.\r\n\r\n\"Ha, lord of my daughter, you're back at last. We had begun to fear\r\nfor you,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing to fear, father of my wife,\" Coru-hin-Irigod replied. \"We\r\nsold the slaves for a good price, and tarried the night feasting in\r\ngood company. Such good company that we brought some of it with\r\nus--Atarazola and Ganadara, men of the Jeseru; Cavu-hin-Avoran, whose\r\ndaughter mothered my sons.\" He took his father-in-law by the sleeve\r\nand pulled him aside, motioning Gathon Dard and Antrath Alv to follow.\r\n\r\n\"They brought weapons; they want outland slaves, of the sort I took to\r\nsell in the Big Valley country,\" he whispered. \"The weapons are\r\nrepeating rifles from across the ocean, and six-shot revolvers. They\r\nalso have much ammunition.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Safar bless you!\" the white-beard cried, his eyes brightening.\r\n\"Name your own price; satisfy yourselves that we have dealt fairly\r\nwith you; go, and return often again! Come, lord of my daughter; let\r\nus make them known to Nebu-hin-Abenoz. But not a word about the kind\r\nof weapons you have, strangers, until we can speak privately. Say only\r\nthat you have rifles to trade.\"\r\n\r\nGathon Dard nodded. Evidently there was some sort of power-struggle\r\ngoing on in Careba; Coru-hin-Irigod and his wife's father were of the\r\nparty of Nebu-hin-Abenoz, and wanted the repeaters and six-shooters\r\nfor themselves.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNebu-hin-Abenoz, swarthy, hook-nosed, with a square-cut graying beard,\r\nlounged in a low chair across the patio; near him four or five other\r\nCaleras sat or squatted or reclined, all smoking the rank black\r\ntobacco of the country and drinking wine or brandy. Their conversation\r\nceased as Cavu-hin-Avoran and the others approached. The chief of\r\nCareba listened to the introduction, then heaved himself to his feet\r\nand clapped the newcomers on the shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"Good, good!\" he said. \"We know you Jeseru people; you're honest\r\ntraders. You come this far into our mountains too seldom. We can trade\r\nwith you. We need weapons. As for the sort of slaves you want, we have\r\nnone too many now, but in eight days we will have plenty. If you stay\r\nwith us that long--\"\r\n\r\n\"Careba is a pleasant place to be,\" Ganadara said. \"We can wait.\"\r\n\r\n\"What sort of weapons have you?\" the chief asked.\r\n\r\n\"Pistols and rifles, lord of my father's sister,\" Coru-hin-Irigod\r\nanswered for them. \"The packs have been taken to my house, where our\r\nfriends will stay. We can bring a few to show you, the hour after\r\nevening prayers.\"\r\n\r\nNebu-hin-Abenoz shot a keen glance at his brother-in-law's son and\r\nnodded. \"Or, better, I will come to your house then; thus I can see\r\nthe whole load. How will that be?\"\r\n\r\n\"Better; I will be there, too,\" Cavu-hin-Avoran said, then turned to\r\nGathon Dard and Antrath Alv. \"You have been long on the road; come,\r\nlet us drink cool wine, and then we will eat,\" he said. \"Until this\r\nevening, Nebu-hin-Abenoz.\"\r\n\r\nHe led his son-in-law and the traders to one side, where several kegs\r\nstood on trestles with cups and flagons beside them. They filled a\r\nflagon, took a cup apiece, and went over to a pile of cushions at one\r\nside.\r\n\r\nAs they did, three men came pushing through the crowd toward\r\nNebu-hin-Abenoz's seat. They wore a costume unfamiliar to Gathon\r\nDard--little round caps with red and green streamers behind, and long,\r\nwide-sleeved white gowns--and one of them had gold rings in his ears.\r\n\r\n\"Nebu-hin-Abenoz?\" one of them said, bowing. \"We are three men of the\r\nUsasu cities. We have gold _obus_ to spend; we seek a beautiful girl,\r\nto be first concubine to our king's son, who is now come to the estate\r\nof manhood.\"\r\n\r\nNebu-hin-Abenoz picked up the silver-mounted pipe he had laid aside,\r\nand re-lighted it, frowning.\r\n\r\n\"Men of the Usasu, you have a heavy responsibility,\" he said. \"You\r\nhave the responsibility for the future of your kingdom, for a boy's\r\ncharacter is more shaped by his first concubine than by his teachers.\r\nHow old is the boy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sixteen, Nebu-hin-Abenoz; the age of manhood among us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you want a girl older, but not much older. She should be versed\r\nin the arts of love, but innocent of heart. She should be wise, but\r\nteachable; gentle and loving, but with a will of her own--\"\r\n\r\nThe three men in white gowns were fidgeting. Then, suddenly, like three\r\nmarionettes on a single string, they put their right hands to their\r\nmouths and then plunged them into the left sleeves of their gowns,\r\nwhipping out knives and then sprang as one upon Nebu-hin-Abenoz,\r\nslashing and stabbing.\r\n\r\nGathon Dard was on his feet at once; he hurled the wine flagon at the\r\nthree murderers and leaped across the room. Antrath Alv went bounding\r\nafter him, and by this time three or four of the group around\r\nNebu-hin-Abenoz's chair had recovered their wits and jumped to their\r\nfeet. One of the three assailants turned and slashed with his knife,\r\nalmost disemboweling a Calera who had tried to grapple with him.\r\nBefore he could free the blade, another Calera brought a brandy bottle\r\ndown on his head. Gathon Dard sprang upon the back of a second\r\nassassin, hooking his left elbow under the fellow's chin and grabbing\r\nthe wrist of his knife-hand with his right; the man struggled for an\r\ninstant, then went limp and fell forward. The third of the trio of\r\nmurderers was still slashing at the fallen chieftain when Antrath Alv\r\nchopped him along the side of the neck with the edge of his hand; he\r\nsimply dropped and lay still.\r\n\r\nNebu-hin-Abenoz was dead. He had been slashed and cut and stabbed in\r\ntwenty places; his throat had been cut at least three times, and he\r\nhad almost been decapitated. The wounded Calera wasn't dead yet;\r\nhowever, even if he had been at the moment on the operating table of a\r\nFirst Level Home Time Line hospital, it was doubtful if he could have\r\nbeen saved, and under the circumstances, his life-expectancy could be\r\nmeasured in seconds. Some cushions were placed under his head, and\r\nwomen called to attend him, but he died before they arrived.\r\n\r\nThe three assassins were also dead. Except for a few cuts on the scalp\r\nof the one who had been felled with the bottle, there was not a mark\r\non any of them. Cavu-hin-Avoran kicked one of them in the face and\r\ncursed.\r\n\r\n\"We killed the skunks too quickly!\" he cried. \"We should have overcome\r\nthem alive, and then taken our time about dealing with them as they\r\ndeserved.\" He went on to specify the nature of their deserts. \"Such\r\ninfamy!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll swear I didn't think a little tap like I gave that one\r\nwould kill him,\" the bottle-wielder excused himself. \"Of course, I was\r\nthinking only of Nebu-hin-Abenoz, Safar receive him--\"\r\n\r\nAntrath Alv bent over the one he had hand-chopped.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't kill this one,\" he said. \"The way I hit him, if I had, his\r\nneck would be broken, and it's not. See?\" He twisted at the dead man's\r\nneck. \"I think they took poison before they drew their knives.\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw all of them put their hands to their mouths!\" a Calera\r\nexclaimed. \"And look; see how their jaws are clenched.\" He picked up\r\none of the knives and used it to pry the dead man's jaws apart,\r\nsniffing at his lips and looking into his mouth. \"Look, his teeth and\r\nhis tongue are discolored; there is a strange smell, too.\"\r\n\r\nAntrath Alv sniffed, then turned to his partner. \"Halatane,\" he\r\nwhispered. Gathon Dard nodded. That was a First Level poison;\r\nparatimers often carried halatane capsules on the more barbaric\r\ntime-lines, as a last insurance against torture.\r\n\r\n\"But, Holy Name of Safar, what manner of men were these?\"\r\nCoru-hin-Irigod demanded. \"There are those I would risk my life to\r\nkill, but I would not throw it away thus.\"\r\n\r\n\"They came knowing that we would kill them, and took the poison that\r\nthey might die quickly and without pain,\" a Calera said.\r\n\r\n\"Or that your tortures would not wring from them the names and nation\r\nof those who sent them,\" an elderly man in the dress of a rancher from\r\nthe southeast added. \"If I were you, I would try to find out who these\r\nenemies are, and the sooner the better.\"\r\n\r\nGathon Dard was examining one of the knives--a folding knife with a\r\nbroad single-edged blade, locked open with a spring; the handle was of\r\ntortoise shell, bolstered with brass.\r\n\r\n\"In all my travels,\" he said, \"I never saw a knife of this workmanship\r\nbefore. Tell me, Coru-hin-Irigod, do you know from what country these\r\noutland slaves of Nebu-hin-Abenoz's come?\"\r\n\r\n\"You think that might have something to do with it?\" the Calera asked.\r\n\r\n\"It could. I think that these people might not have been born slaves,\r\nbut people taken captive. Suppose, at some time, there had been sold\r\nto Nebu-hin-Abenoz, and sold elsewhere by him, one who was a person of\r\nconsequence--the son of a king, or the priest of some god,\" Gathon\r\nDard suggested.\r\n\r\n\"By Safar, yes! And now that nation, wherever it is, is at blood-feud\r\nwith us,\" Cavu-hin-Avoran said. \"This must be thought about; it is an\r\nill thing to have unknown enemies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look!\" a Calera who had begun to strip the three dead men cried.\r\n\"These are not of the Usasu cities, or any other people of this land.\r\nSee, they are uncircumcised!\"\r\n\r\n\"Many of the slaves whom Nebu-hin-Abenoz brought to Careba from the\r\nhills have been uncircumcised,\" Coru-hin-Irigod said. \"Jeseru, I think\r\nyou have your sights on the heart of it.\" He frowned. \"Now, think you,\r\nwill those who had this done be satisfied, or will they carry on their\r\nhatred against all of us?\"\r\n\r\n\"A hard question,\" Antrath Alv said. \"You Caleras do not serve our\r\ngods, but you are our friends. Suffer me to go apart and pray; I would\r\ntake counsel with the gods, that they may aid us all in this.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration:]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 2\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was full daylight, but the sun was hidden; a thin rain fell on the\r\nlanding around at Police Terminal Dhergabar Equivalent when Vall and\r\nDalla left the rocket. Across the black lavalike pavement, they could\r\nsee the bulky form of Tortha Karf, hunched under a long cloak, with\r\nhis flat cap pulled down over his brow. He shook hands with Vall and\r\nkissed cheeks with Dalla when they joined him.\r\n\r\n\"Car's over here,\" he said, nodding toward the waiting vehicle.\r\n\"Yesterday wasn't one of our better days, was it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. It wasn't.\" Vall agreed. They climbed into the car, and the\r\ndriver lifted straight up to two thousand feet and turned, soaring\r\ndown to land on the Chief's Headquarters Building, a mile away. \"We're\r\nnot completely stopped, sir. Ranthar Jard is working on a few ideas\r\nthat may lead him to the Kholghoor time lines where the Wizard Traders\r\nare operating. If we can't get them through their output, we may nail\r\nthem at the intake.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unless they've gotten the wind up and closed down all their\r\noperations,\" Tortha Karf said.\r\n\r\n\"I doubt if they've done that, Chief,\" Vall replied. \"We don't know\r\nwho these people are, of course, and it's hard to judge their\r\nreactions, but they're willing to take chances for big gains. I\r\nbelieve they think they're safe, now that they've closed out the\r\ncompromised time line and killed the only witness against them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what's Ranthar Jard doing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Trying to locate the sub-sector and probability belt from what the\r\nslaves can tell him about their religious beliefs, about the local\r\nking, and the prince of Jhirda, and the noble families of the\r\nneighborhood,\" Vall said. \"When he has it localized as closely as he\r\ncan, he's going to start pelting the whole paratemporal area with\r\nphotographic auto-return balls dropped from aircars on Police Terminal\r\nover the spatial equivalents of a couple of Croutha-conquered cities.\r\nAs soon as he gets a photo that shows Croutha with firearms, he'll\r\nhave a Wizard Trader time line.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sounds simple,\" the Chief said. The car landed, and he helped Dalla\r\nout. \"I suppose both you and he know how many chances against one he\r\nhas of finding anything.\" They went over to an antigrav-shaft and\r\nfloated down to the floor on which Tortha Karf had a duplicate of the\r\noffice in the Paratime Building on Home Time Line. \"It's the only\r\nchance we have, though.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's one thing that bothers me,\" Dalla said, as they entered the\r\noffice and went back behind the horseshoe-shaped desk. \"I understand\r\nthat the news about this didn't break on Home Time Line till the late\r\nmorning of One-Six-One Day. Nebu-hin-Abenoz was murdered at about 1700\r\nlocal time, which would be 0100 this morning Dhergabar time. That\r\nwould give this gang fourteen hours to hear the news, transmit it to\r\ntheir base, and get these three men hypno-conditioned, disguised,\r\ntransposed to this Esaron Sector time line, and into Careba.\" She\r\nshook her head. \"That's pretty fast work.\"\r\n\r\nTortha Karf looked sidewise at Verkan Vall. \"Your girl has the makings\r\nof a cop, Vall,\" he commented.\r\n\r\n\"She's been a big help, on Esaron and Kholghoor Sectors,\" Vall said.\r\n\"She wants to stay with it and help me; I'll be very glad to have her\r\nwith me.\"\r\n\r\nTortha Karf nodded. He knew, too, that Dalla wouldn't want to have to\r\ngo back to Home Time Line and wait the long investigation out.\r\n\r\n\"Of course; we can use all the help we can get. I think we can get a\r\nlot from Dalla. Fix her up with some kind of a title and police\r\nstatus--technical-expert, assistant, or something like that.\" He\r\nclasped hands, man-fashion, with her. \"Glad to have you on the cops\r\nwith us, Dalla,\" he said. Then he turned to Vall. \"There was almost\r\ntwenty-four hours between the time I heard about this and when this\r\nblasted Yandar Yadd got hold of the story. Of all the infernal,\r\nirresponsible--\" He almost choked with indignation. \"And it was\r\nanother fourteen hours between the time Skordran sent in his report\r\nand I heard about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Golzan Doth sent in a report to his company about the same time\r\nSkordran Kirv made his first report to his Sector-Regional Subchief.\"\r\nVall mentioned.\r\n\r\n\"That might be it,\" Tortha Karf considered. \"I wish there were another\r\nexplanation, because that implies a very extensive intelligence\r\nnetwork, which means a big organization. But I'm afraid that's it. I\r\nwish I could pull in everybody in Consolidated Outtime Foodstuffs who\r\nhandled that report, and narco-hypnotize them. Of course, we can't do\r\nthings like that on Home Time Line, and with the political situation\r\nwhat it is now--\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, what's been happening, Chief?\"\r\n\r\nTortha Karf swore with weary bitterness. \"Salgath Trod's what's been\r\nhappening. At first, after Yandar Yadd broke the story on the air,\r\nthere was just a lot of unorganized Opposition sniping in Council;\r\nSalgath waited till the middle of the afternoon, when the Management\r\nmembers were beginning to rally, and took the floor. The Centrists and\r\nRight Moderates were trying the appeal-to-reason approach; that did as\r\nmuch good as trying to put out a Fifth Level forest fire with a\r\nhand-extinguisher. Finally. Salgath got a motion of censure against\r\nthe Management recognized. That means a confidence vote in ten days.\r\nSalgath has a rabble of Leftists and dissident Centrists with him; I\r\ndoubt if he can muster enough votes to overturn the Management, but\r\nit's going to make things rough for us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which may be just the reason Salgath started this uproar,\" Vall\r\nsuggested.\r\n\r\n\"That,\" Tortha Karf said, \"is being considered; there is a discreet\r\ninquiry being made into Salgath Trod's associates, his sources of\r\nincome, and so on. Nothing has turned up as yet, but we have hopes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe,\" Vall said, \"that we have a better chance right on Home\r\nTime Line than outtime.\"\r\n\r\nTortha Karf looked up sharply. \"So?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nVall was stuffing tobacco into a pipe. \"Yes. Chief. We have a big\r\ncriminal organization--let's call it the Slave Trust, for a\r\nconvenience-label. The people who run it aren't stupid. The fact that\r\nthey've been shipping slaves to the Esaron Sector for ten years before\r\nwe found out about it proves that. So does the speed with which they\r\ngot rid of this Nebu-hin-Abenoz, right in front of a pair of our\r\ndetectives. For that matter, so does the speed with which they moved\r\nin to exploit this Croutha invasion of Kholghoor Sector India.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I've studied illegal and subversive organizations all over\r\nparatime, and among the really successful ones, there are a few\r\nuniform principles. One is cellular organization--small groups, acting\r\nin isolation from one another, coöperating with other cells but\r\nignorant of their composition. Another is the principle of no upward\r\ncontact--leaders contacting their subordinates through contact-blocks\r\nand ignorant intermediaries. And another is a willingness to kill off\r\nanybody who looks like a potential betrayer or forced witness. The\r\nlate Nebu-hin-Abenoz, for instance.\r\n\r\n\"I'll be willing to bet that if we pick up some of these Wizard\r\nTraders, say, or a gang that's selling slaves to some Nebu-hin-Abenoz\r\npersonality on some other time line, and narco-hypnotize them, all\r\nthey'll be able to do will be name a few immediate associates, and the\r\ngroup leader will know that he's contacted from time to time by some\r\nstranger with orders, and that he can make emergency contacts only\r\nthrough some blind accommodation-address. The men who are running this\r\nare right on Home Time Line, many of them in positions of prominence,\r\nand if we can catch one of them and narco-hyp him, we can start a\r\nchain-reaction of disclosures all through this Slave Trust.\"\r\n\r\n\"How are we going to get at these top men?\" Tortha Karf wanted to\r\nknow. \"Advertise for them on telecast?\"\r\n\r\n\"They'll leave traces; they won't be able to avoid it. I think, right\r\nnow, that Salgath Trod is one of them. I think there are other\r\nprominent politicians, and business people. Look for irregularities\r\nand peculiarities in outtime currency-exchange transactions. For\r\ninstance, to sections in Esaron Sector _obus_. Or big gold bullion\r\ntransactions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. And if they have any really elaborate outtime bases, they'll\r\nneed equipment that can only be gotten on Home Time Line,\" Tortha Karf\r\nadded. \"Paratemporal conveyer parts, and field-conductor mesh. You\r\ncan't just walk into a hardware store and buy that sort of thing.\"\r\n\r\nDalla leaned forward to drop her cigarette ash into a tray.\r\n\r\n\"Try looking into the Bureau of Psychological Hygiene,\" she suggested.\r\n\"That's where you'll really strike it rich.\"\r\n\r\nVall and Tortha Karf both turned abruptly and looked at her for an\r\ninstant.\r\n\r\n\"Go on,\" Tortha Karf encouraged. \"This sounds interesting.\"\r\n\r\n\"The people back of this,\" Dalla said, \"are definitely classifiable as\r\ncriminals. They may never perform a criminal act themselves, but they\r\ngive orders for and profit from such acts, and they must possess the\r\nmotivation and psychology of criminals. We define people as criminals\r\nwhen they suffer from psychological aberrations of an antisocial\r\ncharacter, usually paranoid--excessive egoism, disregard for the\r\nrights of others, inability to recognize the social necessity for\r\nmutual coöperation and confidence. On Home Time Line, we have\r\nuniversal psychological testing, for the purpose of detecting and\r\neliminating such characteristics.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems to have failed in this case,\" Tortha Karf began, then\r\nsnapped his fingers. \"Of course! How blasted silly can I get, when I'm\r\nnot trying?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, of course,\" Verkan Vall agreed. \"Find out how these people\r\nmissed being spotted by psychotesting; that'll lead us to _who_ missed\r\nbeing tested adequately, and also who got into the Bureau of\r\nPsychological Hygiene who didn't belong there.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you ought to give an investigation of the whole BuPsychHyg\r\nsetup very high priority,\" Dalla said. \"A psychotest is only as good\r\nas the people who give it, and if we have criminals administering\r\nthese tests--\"\r\n\r\n\"We have our friends on Executive Council,\" Tortha Karf said. \"I'll\r\nsee that that point is raised when Council re-convenes.\" He looked at\r\nthe clock. \"That'll be in three hours, by the way. If it doesn't\r\naccomplish another thing, it'll put Salgath Trod in the middle. He\r\ncan't demand an investigation of the Paratime Police out of one side\r\nof his mouth and oppose an investigation of Psychological Hygiene out\r\nof the other. Now what else have we to talk about?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration:]\r\n\r\n\"Those hundred slaves we got off the Esaron Sector,\" Vall said. \"What\r\nare we going to do with them? And if we locate the time line the\r\nslavers have their bases on, we'll have hundreds, probably thousands,\r\nmore.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can't sort them out and send them back to their own time lines,\r\neven if that would be desirable,\" Tortha Karf decided. \"Why, settle\r\nthem somewhere on the Service Sector. I know, the Paratime\r\nTransposition Code limits the Service Sector to natives of time lines\r\nbelow second-order barbarism, but the Paratime Transposition Code has\r\nbeen so badly battered by this business that a few more minor literal\r\ninfractions here and there won't make any difference. Where are they\r\nnow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Police Terminal, Nharkan Equivalent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Better hold them there, for the time being. We may have to open a new\r\nServSec time line to take care of all the slaves we find, if we can\r\nlocate the outtime base line these people are using--Vall, this\r\nthing's too big to handle as a routine operation, along with our other\r\nwork. You take charge of it. Set up your headquarters here, and help\r\nyourself to anything in the way of personnel and equipment you need.\r\nAnd bear in mind that this confidence vote is coming up in ten\r\ndays--on the morning of One-Seven-Two Day. I'm not asking for any\r\nmiracles, but if we don't get this thing cleared up by then, we're in\r\nfor trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"I realize that, sir. Dalla, you'd better go back to Home Time Line,\r\nwith the Chief,\" he said. \"There's nothing you can do to help me,\r\nhere, at present. Get some rest, and then try to wangle an invitation\r\nfor the two of us to dinner at Thalvan Dras' apartments this evening.\"\r\nHe turned back to Tortha Karf. \"Even if he never pays any attention to\r\nbusiness, Dras still owns Consolidated Outtime Foodstuffs,\" he said.\r\n\"He might be able to find out, or help us find out, how the story\r\nabout those slaves leaked out of his company.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that won't take much doing,\" Dalla said. \"If there's as much\r\nexcitement on Home Time Line as I think, Dras would turn somersaults\r\nand jump through hoops to get us to one of his dinners, right now.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSalgath Trod pushed the litter of papers and record-tape spools to one\r\nside impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what else did you expect?\" he demanded. \"This was the logical\r\nnext move. BuPsychHyg is supposed to detect anybody who believes in\r\nlooking out for his own interests first, and condition him into a\r\npious law-abiding sucker. Well, the sacred Bureau of Sucker-Makers\r\nslipped up on a lot of us. It's a natural alibi for Tortha Karf.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's also a lot of grief for all of us,\" the young man in the\r\nwrap-around tunic added. \"I don't want my psychotests reviewed by some\r\nduty-struck bigot who can't be reasoned with, and neither do you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm getting something organized to counter that,\" Salgath Trod said.\r\n\"I'm going to attack the whole scientific basis of psychotesting.\r\nThere's Dr. Frasthor Klav; he's always contended that what are called\r\ncriminal tendencies are the result of the individual's total\r\nenvironment, and that psychotesting and personality-analysis are\r\nvalueless, because the total environment changes from day to day, even\r\nfrom hour to hour--\"\r\n\r\n\"That won't do,\" the nameless young man who was the messenger of\r\nsomebody equally nameless retorted. \"Frasthor's a crackpot; no\r\nreputable psychologist or psychist gives his opinions a moment's\r\nconsideration. And besides, we don't want to attack Psychological\r\nHygiene. The people in it with whom we can do business are our\r\nsafeguard; they've given all of us a clean bill of mental health, and\r\nwe have papers to prove it. What we have to do is to make it appear\r\nthat that incident on the Esaron Sector is all there is to this, and\r\nalso involve the Paratime Police themselves. The slavers are all\r\nparacops. It isn't the fault of BuPsychHyg, because the Paratime\r\nPolice have their own psychotesting staff. That's where the trouble\r\nis; the paracops haven't been adequately testing their own personnel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now how are you going to do that?\" Salgath Trod asked disdainfully.\r\n\r\n\"You'll take the floor, the first thing tomorrow, and utilize these\r\nnew revelations about the Wizard Traders. You'll accuse the Paratime\r\nPolice of being the Wizard Traders themselves. Why not? They have\r\ntheir own paratemporal transposition equipment shops on Police\r\nTerminal, they have facilities for manufacturing duplicates of any\r\nkind of outtime items, like the firearms, for instance, and they know\r\nwhich time lines on which sectors are being exploited by legitimate\r\nparatime traders and which aren't. What's to prevent a gang of\r\nunscrupulous paracops from moving in on a few unexploited Kholghoor\r\ntime lines, buying captives from the Croutha, and shipping them to the\r\nEsaron Sector?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why would they let a thing like this get out?\" Salgath Trod\r\ninquired.\r\n\r\n\"Somebody slipped up and moved a lot of slaves onto an exploited\r\nEsaron time line. Or, rather, Consolidated Outtime Foodstuffs\r\nestablished a plantation on a time line they were shipping slaves to.\r\nParenthetically, that's what really did happen; the mistake our people\r\nmade was in not closing out that time line as soon as Consolidated\r\nFoodstuffs moved in,\" the young man said.\r\n\r\n\"So, this Skordran Kirv, who is a dumb boy who doesn't know what the\r\nscore is, found these slaves and blatted about it to this Golzan Doth,\r\nand Golzan reported it to his company, and it couldn't be hushed up,\r\nso now Tortha Karf is trying to scare the public with ghost stories\r\nabout a gigantic paratemporal conspiracy, to get more appropriations\r\nand more power.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long do you think I'd get away with that?\" Salgath Trod demanded.\r\n\"I can only stretch parliamentary immunity so far. Sooner or later,\r\nI'd have to make formal charges to a special judicial committee, and\r\nthat would mean narco-hypnosis, and then it would all come out.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll have proof,\" the young man said. \"We'll produce a couple of\r\nthese Kharandas whom Verkan Vall didn't get hold of. Under\r\nnarco-hypnosis, they'll testify that they saw a couple of Wizard\r\nTraders take their robes off. Under the robes were Paratime Police\r\nuniforms. Do you follow me?\"\r\n\r\nSalgath Trod made a noise of angry disgust.\r\n\r\n\"That's ridiculous! I suppose these Kharandas will be given what is\r\ndeludedly known as memory obliteration, and a set of pseudo-memories;\r\nhow long do you think that would last? About three ten-days. There is\r\nno such thing as memory obliteration; there's memory-suppression, and\r\npseudo-memory overlay. You can't get behind that with any quickie\r\nnarco-hypnosis in the back room of any police post, I'll admit that,\"\r\nhe said. \"But a skilled psychist can discover, inside of five minutes,\r\nwhen a narco-hypnotized subject is carrying a load of false memories,\r\nand in time, and not too much time, all that top layer of false\r\nmemories and blockages can be peeled off. And then where would we be?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now wait a minute, Councilman. This isn't just something I dreamed\r\nup,\" the visitor said. \"This was decided upon at the top. At the very\r\ntop.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't care whose idea it was,\" Salgath Trod snapped. \"The whole\r\nthing is idiotic, and I won't have anything to do with it.\"\r\n\r\nThe visitor's face froze. All the respect vanished from his manner and\r\ntone; his voice was like ice cakes grating together in a winter river.\r\n\r\n\"Look, Salgath; this is an Organization order,\" he said. \"You don't\r\nrefuse to obey Organization orders, and you don't quit the\r\nOrganization. Now get smart, big boy; do what you're told to.\" He took\r\na spool of record tape from his pocket and laid it on the desk.\r\n\"Outline for your speech; put it in your own words, but follow it\r\nexactly.\" He stood watching Salgath Trod for a moment. \"I won't bother\r\ntelling you what'll happen to you if you don't,\" he added. \"You can\r\nfigure that out for yourself.\"\r\n\r\nWith that, he turned and went out the private door. For a while,\r\nSalgath Trod sat staring after him. Once he put his hand out toward\r\nthe spool, then jerked it back as though the thing were radioactive.\r\nOnce he looked at the clock; it was just 1600.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe green aircar settled onto the landing stage; Verkan Vall, on the\r\nfront seat beside the driver, opened the door.\r\n\r\n\"Want me to call for you later, Assistant Verkan?\" the driver asked.\r\n\r\n\"No thank you, Drenth. My wife and I are going to a dinner-party, and\r\nwe'll probably go night-clubbing afterward. Tomorrow morning, all the\r\nanti-Management commentators will be yakking about my carousing around\r\nwhen I ought to be battling the Slave Trust. No use advertising myself\r\nwith an official car, and giving them a chance to add, 'at public\r\nexpense.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, have some fun while you can,\" the driver advised, reaching for\r\nthe car-radio phone. \"Want me to check you in here, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, if you will. Thank you. Drenth.\"\r\n\r\nKandagro, his human servant, admitted him to the apartment six floors\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n\"Mistress Dalla is dressing,\" he said. \"She asked me to tell you that\r\nyou are invited to dinner, this evening, with Thalvan Dras at his\r\napartment.\"\r\n\r\nVall nodded. \"Ill talk to her about it now,\" he said. \"Lay out my\r\ndress uniform: short jacket, boots and breeches, and needler.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, master: I'll go lay out your things and get your bath ready.\"\r\n\r\nThe servant turned and went into the alcove which gave access to the\r\ndressing rooms, turning right into Vall's. Vall followed him, turning\r\nleft into his wife's.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Dalla!\" he called.\r\n\r\n\"In here!\" her voice came out of her bathroom.\r\n\r\nHe passed through the dressing room, to find her stretched on a\r\nplastic-sheeted couch, while her maid, Rendarra, was rubbing her body\r\nvigorously with some pungent-smelling stuff about the consistency of\r\nmachine-grease. Her face was masked in the stuff, and her hair was\r\ncovered with an elastic cap. He had always suspected that beauty was\r\nthe real feminine religion, from the willingness of its devotees to\r\nsubmit to martyrdom for it. She wiggled a hand at him in greeting.\r\n\r\n\"How did it go?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"So-so. I organized myself a sort of miniature police force within a\r\npolice force and I have liaison officers in every organization down to\r\nSector Regional so that I can be informed promptly in case anything\r\nnew turns up anywhere. What's been happening on Home Time Line? I\r\npicked up a news-summary at Paratime Police Headquarters; it seems\r\nthat a lot more stuff has leaked out. Kholghoor Sector, Wizard Traders\r\nand all. How'd it happen?\"\r\n\r\nDalla rolled over to allow Rendarra to rub the blue-green grease on\r\nher back.\r\n\r\n\"Consolidated Outtime Foodstuffs let a gang of reporters in, today. I\r\nthink they're afraid somebody will accuse them of complicity, and they\r\nwant to get their side of it before the public. All our crowd are off\r\nthat Time line except a couple of detectives at the plantation.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know.\" He smiled; Dalla was thinking of the Paratime Police as \"our\r\ncrowd\" now. \"How about this dinner at Dras' place?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that was easy.\" She shifted position again. \"I just called Dras\r\nup and told him that our vacation was off, and he invited us before I\r\ncould begin hinting. What are you going to wear?\"\r\n\r\n\"Short-jacket greens; I can carry a needler with that uniform, even\r\nwear it at the table. I don't think it's smart for me to run around\r\nunarmed, even on Home Time Line. Especially on Home Time Line,\" he\r\namended. \"When's this affair going to start, and how long will\r\nRendarra take to get that goo off you?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSalgath Trod left his aircar at the top landing stage of his apartment\r\nbuilding and sent it away to the hangars under robot control; he\r\nglanced about him as he went toward the antigrav shaft. There were a\r\ndozen vehicles in the air above; any of them might have followed him\r\nfrom the Paratime Building. He had no doubt that he had been under\r\nconstant surveillance from the moment the nameless messenger had\r\ndelivered the Organization's ultimatum. Until he delivered that\r\nspeech, the next morning, or manifested an intention of refusing to do\r\nso, however, he would be safe. After that--\r\n\r\nAlone in his office, he had reviewed the situation point by point, and\r\nthen gone back and reviewed it again; the conclusion was inescapable.\r\nThe Organization had ordered him to make an accusation which he\r\nhimself knew to be false; that was the first premise. The conclusion\r\nwas that he would be killed as soon as he had made it. That was the\r\ntrouble with being mixed up with that kind of people--you were\r\nexpendable, and sooner or later, they would decide that they would\r\nhave to expend you. And what could you do?\r\n\r\nTo begin with, an accusation of criminal malfeasance made against a\r\nManagement or Paratime Commission agency on the floor of Executive\r\nCouncil was tantamount to an accusation made in court; automatically,\r\nthe accuser became a criminal prosecutor, and would have to repeat his\r\naccusation under narco-hypnosis. Then the whole story would come out,\r\nbit by bit, back to its beginning in that first illegal deal in\r\nIndo-Turanian opium, diverted from trade with the Khiftan Sector and\r\nsold on Second Level Luvarian Empire Sector, and the deals in\r\nradioactive poisons, and the slave trade. He would be able to name few\r\nnames--the Organization kept its activities too well compartmented for\r\nthat--but he could talk of things that had happened, and when, and\r\nwhere, and on what paratemporal areas.\r\n\r\nNo. The Organization wouldn't let that happen, and the only way it\r\ncould be prevented would be by the death of Salgath Trod, as soon as\r\nhe had made his speech. All the talk of providing him with\r\ncorroborative evidence was silly; it had been intended to lead him\r\nmore trustingly to the slaughter. They'd kill him, of course, in some\r\nway that would be calculated to substantiate the story he would no\r\nlonger be able to repudiate. The killer, who would be promptly rayed\r\ndead by somebody else, would wear a Paratime Police uniform, or\r\nsomething like that. That was of no importance, however; by then, he'd\r\nbe beyond caring.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne of his three ServSec Prole servants--the slim brown girl who was\r\nhis housekeeper and hostess, and also his mistress--admitted him to\r\nthe apartment. He kissed her perfunctorily and closed the door behind\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"You're tired,\" she said. \"Let me call Nindrandigro and have him bring\r\nyou chilled wine; lie down and rest until dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no; I want brandy.\" He went to a cellaret and got out a decanter\r\nand goblet, pouring himself a drink. \"How soon will dinner be ready?\"\r\n\r\nThe brown girl squeezed a little golden globe that hung on a chain\r\naround her neck; a tiny voice, inside it, repeated: \"Eighteen\r\ntwenty-three ten, eighteen twenty-three eleven, eighteen twenty-three\r\ntwelve--\"\r\n\r\n\"In half an hour. It's still in the robo-chef,\" she told him.\r\n\r\nHe downed half the goblet-full, set it down, and went to a painting, a\r\nbrutal scarlet and apple-green abstraction, that hung on the wall.\r\nSwinging it aside and revealing the safe behind it, he used his\r\nidentity-sigil, took out a wad of Paratemporal Exchange Bank notes and\r\ngave them to the girl.\r\n\r\n\"Here, Zinganna; take these, and take Nindrandigro and Calilla out for\r\nthe evening. Go where you can all have a good time, and don't come\r\nback till after midnight. There will be some business transacted here,\r\nand I want them out of this. Get them out of here as soon as you can;\r\nI'll see to the dinner myself. Spend all of that you want to.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl riffled through the wad of banknotes. \"Why, _thank_ you,\r\nTrod!\" She threw her arms around his neck and kissed him\r\nenthusiastically. \"I'll go tell them at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"And have a good time, Zinganna; have the best time you possibly can,\"\r\nhe told her, embracing and kissing her. \"Now, get out of here; I have\r\nto keep my mind on business.\"\r\n\r\nWhen she had gone, he finished his drink and poured another. He drew\r\nand checked his needler. Then, after checking the window-shielding and\r\nactivating the outside viewscreens, he lit a cheroot and sat down at\r\nthe desk, his goblet and his needler in front of him, to wait until\r\nthe servants were gone.\r\n\r\nThere was only one way out alive. He knew that, and yet he needed\r\nbrandy, and a great deal of mental effort, to steel himself for it.\r\nPsycho-rehabilitation was a dreadful thing to face. There would be\r\nalmost a year of unremitting agony, physical and mental, worse than a\r\nKhiftan torture rack. There would be the shame of having his innermost\r\nsecrets poured out of him by the psychotherapists, and, at the end,\r\nthere would emerge someone who would not be Salgath Trod, or anybody\r\nlike Salgath Trod, and he would have to learn to know this stranger,\r\nand build a new life for him.\r\n\r\nIn one of the viewscreens, he saw the door to the service hallway\r\nopen. Zinganna, in a black evening gown and a black velvet cloak, and\r\nCalilla, the housemaid, in what she believed to be a reasonable\r\nfacsimile of fashionable First Level dress, and Nindrandigro, in one\r\nof his master's evening suits, emerged. Salgath Trod waited until they\r\nhad gone down the hall to the antigrav shaft, and then he turned on\r\nthe visiphone, checked the security, set it for sealed beam\r\ncommunication, and punched out a combination.\r\n\r\nA girl in a green tunic looked out of the screen.\r\n\r\n\"Paratime Police,\" she said. \"Office of Chief Tortha.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am Executive Councilman Salgath Trod,\" he told her. \"I am, and for\r\nthe past fifteen years have been, criminally involved with the\r\norganization responsible for the slave trade which recently came to\r\nlight on Third Level Esaron. I give myself up unconditionally; I am\r\nwilling to make full confession under narco-hypnosis, and will accept\r\nwhatever disposition of my case is lawfully judged fit. You'll have to\r\nsend an escort for me; I might start from my apartment alone, but I'd\r\nbe killed before I got to your headquarters--\"\r\n\r\nThe girl, who had begun to listen in the bored manner of public\r\nservants phone girls, was staring wide-eyed.\r\n\r\n\"Just a moment, Councilman Salgath; I'll put you through to Chief\r\nTortha.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe dinner lacked a half hour of being served; Thalvan Dras' guests\r\nloitered about the drawing room, sampling appetizers and chilled\r\ndrinks and chatting in groups. It wasn't the artistic crowd usual at\r\nThalvan Dras' dinners; most of the guests seemed to be business or\r\npolitical people. Thalvan Dras had gotten Vall and Dalla into the\r\nsmall group around him, along with pudgy, infantile-faced Brogoth\r\nZaln, his confidential secretary, and Javrath Brend, his financial\r\nattorney.\r\n\r\n\"I don't see why they're making such a fuss about it,\" one of the\r\nBanking Cartel people was saying. \"Causing a lot of public excitement\r\nall out of proportion to the importance of the affair. After all,\r\nthose people were slaves on their own time line, and if anything,\r\nthey're much better off on the Esaron Sector than they would be as\r\ncaptives of the Croutha. As far as that goes, what's the difference\r\nbetween that and the way we drag these Fourth Level Primitive\r\nSector-Complex people off to Fifth Level Service Sector to work for\r\nus?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, there's a big difference, Farn,\" Javrath Brend said. \"We recruit\r\nthose Fourth Level Primitives out of probability worlds of Stone Age\r\nsavagery, and transpose them to our own Fifth Level time lines,\r\npractically outtime extensions of the Home Time Line. There's\r\nabsolutely no question of the Paratime Secret being compromised.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration:]\r\n\r\n\"Beside, we need a certain amount of human labor, for tasks requiring\r\noriginal thought and decision that are beyond the ability of robots,\r\nand most of it is work our Citizens simply wouldn't perform,\" Thalvan\r\nDras added.\r\n\r\n\"Well, from a moral standpoint, wouldn't these Esaron Sector people\r\nwho buy the slaves justify slavery in the same terms?\" a woman whom\r\nVall had identified as a Left Moderate Council Member asked.\r\n\r\n\"There's still a big difference,\" Dalla told her. \"The ServSec Proles\r\naren't beaten or tortured or chained; we don't break up families or\r\nseparate friends. When we recruit Fourth Level Primitives, we take\r\nwhole tribes, and they come willingly. And--\"\r\n\r\nOne of Thalvan Dras' black-liveried human servants, of the class under\r\ndiscussion, approached Vall.\r\n\r\n\"A visiphone call for your lordship,\" he whispered. \"Chief Tortha Karf\r\ncalling. If your lordship will come this way--\"\r\n\r\nIn a screen-booth outside, Vall found Tortha Karf looking out of the\r\nscreen; he was seated at his desk, fiddling with a gold multicolor\r\npen.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Vall; something interesting has just come up.\" He spoke in a\r\nvoice of forced calmness. \"I can't go into it now, but you'll want to\r\nhear about it. I'm sending a car for you. Better bring Dalla along;\r\nshe'll want in on it, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right; we'll be on the top south-west landing stage in a few\r\nminutes.\"\r\n\r\nDalla was still heatedly repudiating any resemblance between the\r\nnormal First Level methods of labor-recruitment and the activities of\r\nthe Wizard Traders; she had just finished the story of the woman whose\r\nchild had been brained when Vall rejoined the group.\r\n\r\n\"Dras, I'm awfully sorry,\" he said. \"This is the second time in\r\nsuccession that Dalla and I have had to bolt away from here, but\r\npolicemen are like doctors--always on call, and consequently\r\nunreliable guests. While you're feasting, think commiseratingly of\r\nDalla and me; we'll probably be having a sandwich and a cup of coffee\r\nsomewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm terribly sorry.\" Thalvan Dras replied. \"We had all been looking\r\nforward--Well! Brogoth, have a car called for Vall and Dalla.\"\r\n\r\n\"Police car coming for us; it's probably on the landing stage now,\"\r\nVall said. \"Well, good-by, everybody. Coming, Dalla?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey had a few minutes to wait, under the marquee, before the green\r\npolice aircar landed and came rolling across the rain-wet surface of\r\nthe landing stage. Crossing to it and opening the rear door, he put\r\nDalla in and climbed in after her, slamming the door. It was only then\r\nthat he saw Tortha Karf hunched down in the rear seat. He motioned\r\nthem to silence, and did not speak until the car was rising above the\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\n\"I wanted to fill you in on this, as soon as possible,\" he said. \"Your\r\nhunch about Salgath Trod was good; just a few minutes before I called\r\nyou, he called me. He says this slave trade is the work of something\r\nhe calls the Organization; says he's been taking orders from them for\r\nyears. His attack on the Management and motion for a censure-vote\r\nwere dictated from Organization top echelon. Now he's convinced that\r\nthey're going to force him to make false accusations against the\r\nParatime Police and then kill him before he's compelled to repeat his\r\ncharges under narco-hypnosis. So he's offered to surrender and trade\r\ninformation for protection.\"\r\n\r\n\"How much does he know?\" Vall asked.\r\n\r\nTortha Karf shook his head. \"Not as much as he claims to, I suppose;\r\nhe wouldn't want to reduce his own trade-in value. But he's been\r\ninvolved in this thing for the last fifteen years, and with his\r\npolitical prominence, he'd know quite a lot.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can protect him from his own gang; can we protect him from\r\npsycho-rehabilitation?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, and he knows it. He's willing to accept that. He seems to think\r\nthat death at the hands of his own associates is the only other\r\nalternative. Probably right, too.\"\r\n\r\nThe floodlighted green towers of the Paratime Building were wheeling\r\nunder them as they circled down.\r\n\r\n\"Why would they sacrifice a valuable accomplice like Salgath Trod, in\r\norder to make a transparently false accusation against us?\" Vall\r\nwondered.\r\n\r\n\"Ha, that's our new rookie cop's idea!\" Tortha Karf chuckled, nodding\r\ntoward Dalla. \"We got Zortan Harn to introduce an urgent-business\r\nmotion to appoint a committee to investigate BuPsychHyg, this morning.\r\nThe motion passed, and this is the reaction to it. The Organization's\r\nscared. Just as Dalla predicted, they don't want us finding out how\r\npeople with potentially criminal characteristics missed being spotted\r\nby psychotesting. Salgath Trod is being sacrificed to block or delay\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\nVall nodded as the wheels bumped on the landing stage and the antigrav\r\nfield went off. That was the sort of thing that happened when you\r\nstarted on a really fruitful line of investigation. They got out and\r\nhurried over under the marquee, the car lifting and moving off toward\r\nthe hangars. This was the real break; no matter how this Organization\r\nmight be compartmented, a man like Salgath Trod would know a great\r\ndeal. He would name names, and the bearers of those names, arrested\r\nand narco-hypnotized, would name other names, in a perfect chain\r\nreaction of confessions and betrayals.\r\n\r\nAnother police car had landed just ahead of them, and three men were\r\nclimbing out; two were in Paratime Police green, and the third,\r\nhand-cuffed, was in Service Sector Proletarian garb. At first, Vall\r\nthough that Salgath Trod had been brought in disguised as a Prole\r\nprisoner, and then he saw that the prisoner was short and stocky, not\r\nat all like the slender and elegant politician. The two officers who\r\nhad brought him in were talking to a lieutenant, Sothran Barth,\r\noutside the antigrav shaft kiosk. As Vall and Tortha Karf and Dalla\r\nwalked over, the car which had brought them lifted out.\r\n\r\n\"Something that just came in from Industrial Twenty-four, Chief,\"\r\nLieutenant Sothran said in answer to Tortha Karf's question. \"May be\r\nfor Assistant Verkan's desk.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's a Prole named Yandragno, sir,\" one of the policemen said.\r\n\"Industrial Sector Constabulary grabbed him peddling Martian hellweed\r\ncigarettes to the girls in a textile mill at Kangabar Equivalent.\r\nCaptain Jamzar thinks he may have gotten them from somebody in the\r\nOrganization.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA little warning bell began ringing in the back of Verkan Vall's mind,\r\nbut at first he could not consciously identify the cause of his\r\nsuspicions. He looked the two policemen and their prisoner over\r\ncarefully, but could see nothing visibly wrong with them. Then another\r\ncar came in for a landing and rolled over under the marquee; the door\r\nopened, and a police officer got out, followed by an elegantly dressed\r\ncivilian whom he recognized at once as Salgath Trod. A second\r\npoliceman was emerging from the car when Vall suddenly realized what\r\nit was that had disturbed him.\r\n\r\nIt had been Salgath Trod, himself, less than half an hour ago, who had\r\nintroduced the term, \"the Organization,\" to the Paratime Police. At\r\nthat time, if these people were what they claimed to be, they would\r\nhave been in transposition from Industrial Twenty-four, on the Fifth\r\nLevel. Immediately, he reached for his needler. He was clearing it of\r\nthe holster when things began happening.\r\n\r\nThe handcuffs fell from the \"prisoner's\" wrists; he jerked a\r\nneutron-disruption blaster from under his jacket. Vall, his needler\r\nalready drawn, rayed the fellow dead before he could aim it, then saw\r\nthat the two pseudo-policemen had drawn their needlers and were aiming\r\nin the direction of Salgath Trod. There were no flashes or reports;\r\nonly the spot of light that had winked on and off under Vall's rear\r\nsight had told him that his weapon had been activated. He saw it\r\nappear again as the sights centered on one of the \"policemen.\" Then he\r\nsaw the other imposter's needler aimed at himself. That was the last\r\nthing he expected ever to see, in that life; he tried to shift his own\r\nweapon, and time seemed frozen, with his arm barely moving. Then there\r\nwas a white blur as Dalla's cloak moved in front of him, and the\r\nneedler dropped from the fingers of the disguised murderer. Time went\r\nback to normal for him; he safetied his own weapon and dropped it,\r\njumping forward.\r\n\r\nHe grabbed the fellow in the green uniform by the nose with his left\r\nhand, and punched him hard in the pit of the stomach with his right\r\nfist. The man's mouth flew open, and a green capsule, the size and\r\nshape of a small bean, flew out. Pushing Dalla aside before she would\r\nstep on it, he kicked the murderer in the stomach, doubling him over,\r\nand chopped him on the base of the skull with the edge of his hand.\r\nThe pseudo-policeman dropped senseless.\r\n\r\nWith a handful of handkerchief-tissue from his pocket, he picked up\r\nthe disgorged capsule, wrapping it carefully after making sure that it\r\nwas unbroken. Then he looked around. The other two assassins were\r\ndead. Tortha Karf, who had been looking at the man in Proletarian\r\ndress whom Vall had killed first, turned, looked in another direction,\r\nand then cursed. Vall followed his eyes, and cursed also. One of the\r\ntwo policemen who had gotten out of the aircar was dead, too, and so\r\nwas the all-important witness, Salgath Trod--as dead as\r\nNebu-hin-Abenoz, a hundred thousand parayears away.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe whole thing had ended within thirty seconds; for about half as\r\nlong, everybody waited, poised in a sort of action-vacuum, for\r\nsomething else to happen. Dalla had dropped the shoulder-bag with\r\nwhich she had clubbed the prisoner's needler out of his hand, and\r\ncaught up the fallen weapon. When she saw that the man was down and\r\nmotionless, she laid it aside and began picking up the glittering or\r\nsilken trifles that had spilled from the burst bag. Vall retrieved his\r\nown weapon, glanced over it, and holstered it. Sothran Barth, the\r\nlieutenant in charge of the landing stage, was bawling orders, and men\r\nwere coming out of the ready-room and piling into vehicles to pursue\r\nthe aircar which had brought the assassins.\r\n\r\n\"Barth!\" Vall called. \"Have you a hypodermic and a sleep-drug ampoule?\r\nWell, give this boy a shot; he's only impact-stunned. Be careful of\r\nhim; he's important.\" He glanced around the landing-stage. \"Fact is,\r\nhe's all we have to show for this business.\"\r\n\r\nThen he stooped to help Dalla gather her things, picking up a few of\r\nthem--a lighter, a tiny crystal perfume flask, miraculously unbroken,\r\na face-powder box which had sprung open and spilled half its contents.\r\nHe handed them to her, while Sothran Barth bent over the prisoner and\r\ngave him an injection, then went to the body of the other\r\npseudo-policeman, forcing open his mouth. In his cheek, still\r\nunbroken, was a second capsule, which he added to the first. Tortha\r\nKarf was watching him.\r\n\r\n\"Same gang that killed that Carera slaver on Esaron Sector?\" he asked.\r\n\"Of course, exactly the same general procedure. Let's have a look at\r\nthe other one.\"\r\n\r\nThe man in Proletarian dress must have had his capsule between his\r\nmolars when he had been killed; it was broken, and there was a\r\nbrownish discoloration and chemical odor in his mouth.\r\n\r\n\"Second time we've had a witness killed off under our noses,\" Tortha\r\nKarf said. \"We're going to have to smarten up in a hurry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here's one of us who doesn't have to, much,\" Vall said, nodding\r\ntoward Dalla. \"She knocked a needler out of one man's hand, and we\r\ntook him alive. The Force owes her a new shoulder-bag: she spoiled\r\nthat one using it for a club.\"\r\n\r\n\"Best shoulder-bag we can find you, Dalla,\" Tortha Karf promised.\r\n\"You're promoted, herewith, to Special Chief's Assistant's Special\r\nAssistant--You know, this Organization murder-section is good; they\r\ncould kill anybody. It won't be long before they assign a squad to us.\r\nBlast it, I don't want to have to go around bodyguarded like a Fourth\r\nLevel dictator, but--\"\r\n\r\nA detective came out of the control room and approached.\r\n\r\n\"Screen call for you, sir,\" he told Tortha Karf. \"One of the news\r\nservices wants a comment on a story they've just picked up that we've\r\nillegally arrested Councilman Salgath and are holding him\r\nincommunicado and searching his apartment.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the Organization,\" Vall said. \"They don't know how their boys\r\nmade out; they're hoping we'll tell them.\"\r\n\r\n\"No comment,\" Tortha Karf said. \"Call the girl on my switchboard and\r\ntell her to answer any other news-service calls. We have nothing to\r\nsay at this time, but there will be a public statement at ... at\r\n2330,\" he decided after a glance at his watch. \"That'll give us time\r\nto agree on a publicity line to adopt. Lieutenant Sothran! Take charge\r\nup here. Get all these bodies out of sight somewhere, including those\r\nof Councilman Salgath and Detective Malthor. Don't let anybody talk\r\nabout this; put a blackout on the whole story. Vall, you and Dalla and\r\n... oh, you, over there; take the prisoner down to my office. Sothran,\r\nany reports from any of the cars that were chasing that fake police\r\ncar?\"\r\n\r\nVerkan Vall and Dalla were sitting behind Tortha Karf's desk; Vall was\r\nissuing orders over the intercom and talking to the detectives who had\r\nremained at Salgath Trod's apartment by visiscreen; Dalla was sorting\r\nover the things she had spilled when her bag had burst. They both\r\nlooked up as Tortha Karf came in and joined them.\r\n\r\n\"The prisoner's still under the drug,\" the Chief said. \"He'll be out\r\nfor a couple of hours; the psych-techs want to let him come out of it\r\nnaturally and sleep naturally for a while before they give him a\r\nhypno. He's not a ServSec Prole; uncircumcised, never had any\r\nsyntho-enzyme shots or immunizations, and none of the longevity\r\noperations or grafts. Same thing for the two stiffs. And no identity\r\nrecords on any of the three.\"\r\n\r\n\"The men at Salgath's apartment say that his housekeeper and his two\r\nservants checked out through the house conveyer for ServSec\r\nOne-Six-Five, at about 1830,\" Vall said. \"There's a Prole\r\nentertainment center on that time line. I suppose Salgath gave them\r\nthe evening off before he called you.\"\r\n\r\nTortha Karf nodded. \"I suppose you ordered them picked up. The news\r\nservices are going wild about this. I had to make a preliminary\r\nstatement, to the effect that Salgath Trod was not arrested, came to\r\nHeadquarters of his own volition, and is under no restraint whatever.\"\r\n\r\n\"Except, of course, a slight case of rigor mortis,\" Dalla added. \"Did\r\nyou mention that, Chief?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I didn't.\" Tortha Karf looked as though he had quinine in his\r\nmouth. \"Vall, how in blazes are we going to handle this?\"\r\n\r\n\"We ought to keep Salgath's death hushed up, as long as we can,\" Vall\r\nsaid. \"The Organization doesn't know positively what happened here;\r\nthat's why they're handing out tips to the news services. Let's try to\r\nmake them believe he's still alive and talking.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can we do it?\"\r\n\r\n\"There ought to be somebody on the Force close enough to Salgath\r\nTrod's anthropometric specifications that our cosmeticians could work\r\nhim over into a passable impersonation. Our story is that Salgath is\r\non PolTerm, undergoing narco-hypnosis. We will produce an audio-visual\r\nof him as soon as he is out of narco-hyp. That will give us time to\r\nfix up an impersonator; We'll need a lot of sound-recordings of\r\nSalgath Trod's voice, of course--\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll take care of the Home Time Line end of it; as soon as we get you\r\nan impersonator, you go to work with him. Now, let's see whom we can\r\ndepend on to help us with this. Lovranth Rolk, of course; Home Time\r\nLine section of the Paratime Code Enforcement Division. And--\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVerkan Vall and Dalla and Tortha Karf and four or five others looked\r\nacross the desk and to the end of the room as the telecast screen\r\nbroke into a shifting light-pattern and then cleared. The face of the\r\nannouncer appeared; a young woman.\r\n\r\n\"And now, we bring you the statement which Chief Tortha of the\r\nParatime Police has promised for this time. This portion of the\r\nprogram was audio-visually recorded at Paratime Police Headquarters\r\nearlier this evening.\"\r\n\r\nTortha Karf's face appeared on the screen. His voice began an\r\nannouncement of how Executive Councilman Salgath Trod had called him\r\nby visiphone, admitting to complicity in the recently-discovered\r\nparatemporal slave-trade.\r\n\r\n\"Here is a recording of Councilman Salgath's call to me from his\r\napartment to my office at 1945 this evening.\"\r\n\r\nThe screen-image shattered into light-shards and rebuilt itself:\r\nSalgath Trod, at his desk in the library of his apartment, the\r\nbrandy-goblet and the needler within reach, appeared. He began to\r\nspeak: from time to time the voice of Tortha Karf interrupted,\r\nquestioning or prompting him.\r\n\r\n\"You understand that this confession renders you liable to\r\npsycho-rehabilitation?\" Tortha Karf asked.\r\n\r\nYes, Councilman Salgath understood that.\r\n\r\n\"And you agree to come voluntarily to Paratime Police Headquarters,\r\nand you will voluntarily undergo narco-hypnotic interrogation?\"\r\n\r\nYes, Salgath Trod agreed to that.\r\n\r\n\"I am now terminating the playback of Councilman Salgath's call to\r\nme,\" Tortha Karf said, re-appearing on the screen. \"At this point\r\nCouncilman Salgath began making a statement about his criminal\r\nactivities, which we have on record. Because he named a number of his\r\ncriminal associates, whom we have no intention of warning, this\r\nportion of Councilman Salgath's call cannot at this time be made\r\npublic. We have no intention of having any of these suspects escape,\r\nor of giving their associates an opportunity to murder them to prevent\r\ntheir furnishing us with additional information. Incidentally, there\r\nwas an attempt, made on the landing stage of Paratime Police\r\nHeadquarters, to murder Councilman Salgath, when he was brought here\r\nguarded by Paratime Police officers--\"\r\n\r\nHe went on to give a colorful and, as far as possible, truthful,\r\naccount of the attack by the two pseudo-policemen and their\r\npseudo-prisoner. As he told it, however, all three had been killed\r\nbefore they could accomplish their purpose, one of them by Salgath\r\nTrod himself.\r\n\r\nThe image of Tortha Karf was replaced by a view of the three assassins\r\nlying on the landing stage. They all looked dead, even the one who\r\nwasn't; there was nothing to indicate that he was merely drugged.\r\nThen, one after another, their faces were shown in closeup, while\r\nTortha Karf asked for close attention and memorization.\r\n\r\n\"We believe that these men were Fifth Level Proles; we think that they\r\nwere under hypnotic influence or obeying posthypnotic commands when\r\nthey made their suicidal attack. If any of you have ever seen any of\r\nthese men before, it is your duty to inform the Paratime Police.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat ended it. Tortha Karf pressed a button in front of him and the\r\nscreen went dark. The spectators relaxed.\r\n\r\n\"Well! Nothing like being sincere with the public, is there?\" Della\r\ncommented. \"I'll remember this the next time I tune in a Management\r\npublic statement.\"\r\n\r\n\"In about five minutes,\" one of the bureau-chiefs, said, \"all hell is\r\ngoing to break loose. I think the whole thing is crazy!\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope you have somebody who can give a convincing impersonation,\"\r\nLovranth Rolk said.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. A field agent named Kostran Galth,\" Tortha Karf said. \"We ran\r\nthe personal description cards for the whole Force through the\r\nmachine; Kostran checked to within one-twentieth of one per cent; he's\r\non Police Terminal, now, coming by rocket from Ravvanan Equivalent. We\r\nought to have the whole thing ready for telecast by 1730 tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"He can't learn to imitate Salgath's voice convincingly in that time,\r\nwith all the work the cosmeticians'll have to be doing on him,\" Dalla\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"Make up a tape of Salgath's own voice, out of that pile of recordings\r\nwe got at his apartment, and what we can get out of the news file.\"\r\nVall said. \"We have phoneticists who can split syllables and splice\r\nthem together. Kostran will deliver his speech in dumb-show, and we'll\r\ndub the sound in and telecast them as one. I've messaged PolTerm to\r\nget to work on that; they can start as soon as we have the speech\r\nwritten.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration:]\r\n\r\n\"The more it succeeds now, the worse the blow-up will be when we\r\nfinally have to admit that Salgath was killed here tonight,\" the Chief\r\nInter-officer Coördinator, Zostha Olv said. \"We'd better have\r\nsomething to show the public to justify that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we had,\" Tortha Karf agreed. \"Vall, how about the Kholghoor\r\nSector operation. How far's Ranthar Jard gotten toward locating one of\r\nthose Wizard Trader time lines?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not very far,\" Vall admitted. \"He has it pinned down to the\r\nsub-sector, but the belt seems to be one we haven't any information at\r\nall for. Never been any legitimate penetration by paratimers. He has\r\nhis own hagiologists, and a couple borrowed from Outtime Religious\r\nInstitute; they've gotten everything the slaves can give them on that.\r\nAbout the only thing to do is start random observation with\r\nboomerang-balls.\"\r\n\r\n\"Over about a hundred thousand time lines,\" Zostha Olv scoffed. He was\r\nan old man, even for his long-lived race; he had a thin nose and a\r\nnarrow, bitter, mouth. \"And what will he look for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Croutha with guns.\" Tortha Karf told him, then turned to Vall. \"Can't\r\nhe narrow it more than that? What have his experts been getting out of\r\nthose slaves?\"\r\n\r\n\"That I don't know, to date.\" Vall looked at the clock. \"I'll find\r\nout, though; I'll transpose to Police Terminal and call him up. And\r\nSkordran Kirv. No. Vulthor Tharn; it'd hurt the old fellow's feelings\r\nif I by-passed him and went to one of his subordinates. Half an hour\r\neach way, and at most another hour talking to Ranthar and Vulthor;\r\nthere won't be anything doing here for two hours.\" He rose. \"See you\r\nwhen I get back.\"\r\n\r\nDalla had turned on the telescreen again; after tuning out a dance\r\norchestra and a comedy show, she got the image of an angry-faced man\r\nin evening clothes.\r\n\r\n\"... And I'm going to demand a full investigation, as soon as Council\r\nconvenes tomorrow morning!\" he was shouting. \"This whole story is a\r\npreposterous insult to the integrity of the entire Executive Council,\r\nyour elected representatives, and it shows the criminal lengths to\r\nwhich this would-be dictator, Tortha Karf, and his jackal Verkan Vall\r\nwill go--\"\r\n\r\n\"So long, jackal.\" Dalla called to him as he went out.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe spent the half-hour transposition to Police Terminal sleeping.\r\nParatime-transpositions and rocket-flights seemed to be his only\r\nchance to get any sleep. He was still sleepy when he sat down in front\r\nof the radio telescreen behind his duplicate of Tortha Karf's desk and\r\nput through a call to Nharkan Equivalent. It was 0600 in India; the\r\nSector Regional Deputy Subchief who was holding down Ranthar Jard's\r\ndesk looked equally sleepy; he had a mug of coffee in front of him,\r\nand a brown-paper cigarette in his mouth.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, hello, Assistant Verkan. Want me to call Subchief Ranthar?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he sleeping? Then for mercy's sake don't. What's the present\r\nstatus of the investigation?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we were dropping boomerang balls yesterday, while we had sun to\r\nmask the return-flashes. Nothing. The Croutha have taken the city of\r\nSohram, just below the big bend of the river. Tomorrow, when we have\r\nsunlight, we're going to start boomerang-balling the central square.\r\nWe may get something.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Wizard Traders'll be moving in near there, about now,\" Vall said.\r\n\"The Croutha ought to have plenty of merchandise for them. Have you\r\ngotten anything more done on narrowing down the possible area?\"\r\n\r\nThe deputy bit back a yawn and reached for his coffee mug.\r\n\r\n\"The experts have just about pumped these slaves empty,\" he said. \"The\r\nlocal religion is a mess. Seems to have started out as a Great Mother\r\ncult; then it picked up a lot of gods borrowed from other peoples;\r\nthen it turned into a dualistic monotheism; then it picked up a lot of\r\nminor gods and devils--new devils usually gods of the older pantheon.\r\nAnd we got a lot of gossip about the feudal wars and faction-fights\r\namong the nobility, and so on, all garbled, because these people are\r\npeasants who only knew what went on on the estate of their own lord.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did go on there?\" Vall asked. \"Ask them about recent\r\nimprovements, new buildings, new fields cleared, new paddies flooded,\r\nthat sort of thing. And pick out a few of the highest IQ's from both\r\ntime lines, and have them locate this estate on a large-scale map, and\r\ndraw plans showing the location of buildings, fields and other visible\r\nfeatures. If you have to, teach them mapping and sketching by\r\nhypno-mech. And then drop about five hundred to a thousand boomerang\r\nballs, at regular intervals, over the whole paratemporal area. When\r\nyou locate a time line that gives you a picture to correspond to their\r\ndescription, boomerang the main square in Sohram over the whole belt\r\naround it, to find Croutha with firearms.\"\r\n\r\nThe deputy looked at him for a moment then gulped more coffee.\r\n\r\n\"Can do, Assistant Verkan. I think I'll send somebody to wake up\r\nSubchief Ranthar, right now. Want to talk to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Won't be necessary. You're recording this call, of course? Then play\r\nit back to him. And get cracking with the slaves; you want enough\r\ninformation out of them to enable you to start boomerang balling as\r\nsoon as the sun's high enough.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe broke off the connection and sent out for coffee for himself. Then\r\nhe put through a call to Novilan Equivalent, in western North America.\r\n\r\nIt was 1530, there, when he got Vulthor Tharn on the screen.\r\n\r\n\"Good afternoon. Assistant Verkan. I suppose you're calling about the\r\nslave business. I've turned the entire matter over to Field Agent\r\nSkordran; gave him a temporary rank of Deputy Subchief. That's subject\r\nto your approval and Chief Tortha's, of course--\"\r\n\r\n\"Make the appointment permanent,\" Vall said. \"I'll have a confirmation\r\nalong from Chief Tortha directly. And let me talk to him now, if you\r\nplease. Subchief Vulthor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. Switching you over now.\" The screen went into a beautiful\r\nburst of abstract art, and cleared, after a while, with Skordran Kirv\r\nlooking out of it.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Deputy Skordran, and congratulations. What's come up since we\r\nhad Nebu-hin-Abenoz cut out from under us?\"\r\n\r\n\"We went in on that time line, that same night, with an airboat and\r\nmade a recon in the hills back of Careba. Scared the fear of Safar\r\ninto a party of Caleras while we were working at low altitude, by the\r\nway. We found the conveyer-head site: hundred-foot circle with all the\r\ngrass and loose dirt transposed off it and a pole pen, very unsanitary\r\nwhere about two-three hundred slaves would be kept at a time. No\r\nindications of use in the last ten days. We did some pretty thorough\r\nboomeranging on that spatial equivalent over a couple of thousand time\r\nlines and found thirty more of them. I believe the slavers have closed\r\nout the whole Esaron Sector operation, at least temporarily.\"\r\n\r\nThat was what he'd been afraid of; he hoped they wouldn't do the same\r\nthing on the Kholghoor Sector.\r\n\r\n\"Let me have the designations of the time lines on which you found\r\nconveyer heads,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Just a moment, Chief's Assistant; I'll photoprint them to you. Set\r\nfor reception?\"\r\n\r\nVall opened a slide under the screen and saw that the photoprint film\r\nwas in place, then closed it again, nodding. Skordran Kirv fed a sheet\r\nof paper into his screen cabinet and his arm moved forward out of the\r\npicture.\r\n\r\n\"On, sir,\" he said. He and Vall counted ten seconds together, and then\r\nSkordran Kirv said: \"Through to you.\" Vall pressed a lever under his\r\nscreen, and a rectangle of microcopy print popped out.\r\n\r\n\"That's about all I have, sir. Want me to keep my troops ready here,\r\nor shall I send them somewhere else?\"\r\n\r\n\"Keep them ready, Kirv,\" Vall told him. \"You may need them before\r\nlong. Call you later.\"\r\n\r\nHe put the microcopy in an enlarger, and carried the enlarged print\r\nwith him to the conveyer room. There was something odd about the list\r\nof time line designations. They were expressed numerically, in First\r\nLevel notation; extremely short groups of symbols capable of exact\r\nexpression of almost inconceivably enormous numbers. Vall had only a\r\ngeneral-education smattering of mathematics--enough to qualify him for\r\nthe chair of Higher Mathematics at any university on, say, the Fourth\r\nLevel Europo-American Sector--and he could not identify the\r\npeculiarity, but he could recognize that there existed some sort of\r\npattern. Shoving in the starting lever, he relaxed in one of the\r\nchairs, waiting for the transposition field to build up around him,\r\nand fell asleep before the mesh dome of the conveyer had vanished. He\r\nwoke, the list of time line designations in his hand, when the\r\nconveyor rematerialized on Home Time Line. Putting it in his pocket,\r\nhe hurried to an antigrav shaft and floated up to the floor on which\r\nTortha Karf's office was.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTortha Karf was asleep in his chair; Dalla was eating a dinner that\r\nhad been brought in to her--something better than the sandwich and mug\r\nof coffee Vall had mentioned to Thalvan Dras. Several of the bureau\r\nchiefs who had been there when he had gone out had left, and the\r\npsychist who had taken charge of the prisoner was there.\r\n\r\n\"I think he's coming out of the drug, now,\" he reported. \"Still\r\nasleep, though. We want him to waken naturally before we start on him.\r\nThey'll call me as soon as he shows signs of stirring.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Opposition's claiming, now, that we drugged and hypnotized\r\nSalgath into making that visiscreen confession,\" Dalla said. \"Can you\r\nthink of any way you could do that without making the subject\r\nincapable of lying?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pseudo-memories,\" the psychist said. \"It would take about three times\r\nas long as the time between Salgath Trod's departure from his\r\napartment and the time of the telecast, though--\"\r\n\r\n\"You know much higher math?\" Vall asked the psychist.\r\n\r\n\"Well, enough to handle my job. Neuron-synapse inter-relations,\r\nmemory-and-association patterns, that kind of thing, all have to be\r\nexpressed mathematically.\"\r\n\r\nVall nodded and handed him the time-line designation list.\r\n\r\n\"See any kind of a pattern there?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nThe psychist looked at the paper and blanked his face as he drew on\r\nhypnotically-acquired information.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I'd say that all the numbers are related in some kind of a\r\nseries to some other number. Simplified down to kindergarten level,\r\nsay the difference between A and B is, maybe, one-decillionth of the\r\ndifference between X and A, and the difference between B and C is\r\none-decillionth of the difference between X and B, and so on--\"\r\n\r\nA voice came out of one of the communication boxes:\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Nentrov; the patient's out of the drug, and he's beginning to\r\nstir about.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's it,\" the psychist said. \"I have to run.\" He handed the sheet\r\nback to Vall, took a last drink from his coffee cup, and bolted out of\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nDalla picked up the sheet of paper and looked at it. Vall told her\r\nwhat it was.\r\n\r\n\"If those time lines are in regular series, they relate to the base\r\nline of operations,\" she said. \"Maybe you can have that worked out. I\r\ncan see how it would be; a stated interval between the Esaron Sector\r\nlines, to simplify transposition control settings.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was what I was thinking. It's not quite as simple as Dr. Nentrov\r\nexpressed it, but that could be the general idea. We might be able to\r\nwork out the location of the base line from that. There seems to be a\r\nbreak in the number sequence in here; that would be the time line\r\nSkordran Kirv found those slaves on.\" He reached for the pipe he had\r\nleft on the desk when he had gone to Police Terminal and began filling\r\nit.\r\n\r\nA little later, a buzzer sounded and a light came on on one of the\r\ncommunication boxes. He flipped the switch and said, \"Verkan Vall\r\nhere.\" Sothran Barth's voice came cut of the box.\r\n\r\n\"They've just brought in Salgath Trod's servants. Picked them up as\r\nthey came out of the house conveyer at the apartment building. I don't\r\nbelieve they know what's happened.\"\r\n\r\nVall flipped a switch and twiddled a dial; a viewscreen lit up,\r\nshowing the landing stage. The police car had just landed: one\r\ndetective had gotten out, and was helping the girl, Zinganna, who had\r\nbeen Salgath Trod's housekeeper and mistress, to descend. She was\r\nreally beautiful. Vall thought: rather tall, slender, with dark eyes\r\nand a creamy light-brown skin. She wore a black cloak, and, under it,\r\na black and silver evening gown. A single jewel twinkled in her black\r\nhair. She could have very easily passed for a woman of his own race.\r\n\r\nThe housemaid and the butler were a couple of entirely different\r\narticles. Both were about four or five generations from Fourth Level\r\nPrimitive savagery. The maid, in garishly cheap finery, was big-boned\r\nand heavy-bodied, with red-brown hair; she looked like a member of one\r\nof the northern European reindeer-herding peoples who had barely\r\nmanaged to progress as far as the bow and arrow. The butler was\r\nprobably a mixture of half a dozen primitive races; he was wearing one\r\nof his late master's evening suits, a bright mellow-pink, which was\r\ndistinctly unflattering to his complexion.\r\n\r\nThe sound-pickup was too far away to give him what they were saying,\r\nbut the butler and maid were waving their arms and protesting\r\nvehemently. One of the detectives took the woman by the arm; she\r\njerked it loose and aimed a backhand slap at him. He blocked it on his\r\nforearm. Immediately, the girl in black turned and said something to\r\nher, and she subsided. Vall said, into the box:\r\n\r\n\"Barth, have the girl in the black cloak brought down to Number Four\r\nInterview Room. Put the other two in separate detention cubicles;\r\nwe'll talk to them later.\" He broke the connection and got to his\r\nfeet. \"Come on, Dalla. I want you to help me with the girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just try and stop me,\" Dalla told him. \"Any interviews you have with\r\nthat little item, I want to sit in on.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Proletarian girl, still guarded by a detective, had already been\r\nplaced in the interview room. The detective nodded to Vall, tried to\r\nsuppress a grin when he saw Dalla behind him, and went out. Vall saw\r\nhis wife and the prisoner seated, and produced his cigarette case,\r\nhanding it around.\r\n\r\n\"You're Zinganna; you're of the household of Councilman Salgath Trod,\r\naren't you?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Housekeeper and hostess,\" the girl replied. \"I am also his mistress.\"\r\n\r\nVall nodded, smiling. \"Which confirms my long-standing respect for\r\nCouncilman Salgath's exquisite taste.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, thank you,\" she said. \"But I doubt if I was brought here to\r\nreceive compliments. Or was I?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I'm afraid not. Have you heard the newscasts of the past few\r\nhours concerning Councilman Salgath?\"\r\n\r\nShe straightened in her seat, looking at him seriously.\r\n\r\n\"No. I and Nindrandigro and Calilla spent the evening on ServSec\r\nOne-Six-Five. Councilman Salgath told me that he had some business and\r\nwanted them out of the apartment, and wanted me to keep an eye on\r\nthem. We didn't hear any news at all.\" She hesitated. \"Has anything\r\n... serious ... happened?\"\r\n\r\nVall studied her for a moment, then glanced at Dalla. There existed\r\nbetween himself and his wife a sort of vague, semitelepathic, rapport;\r\nthey had never been able to transmit definite and exact thoughts, but\r\nthey could clearly prehend one another's feelings and emotions. He was\r\nconscious, now, of Dalla's sympathy for the Proletarian girl.\r\n\r\n\"Zinganna, I'm going to tell you something that is being kept from the\r\npublic,\" he said. \"By doing so, I will make it necessary for us to\r\ndetain you, at least for a few days. I hope you will forgive me, but I\r\nthink you would forgive me less if I didn't tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Something's happened to him,\" she said, her eyes widening and her\r\nbody tensing.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Zinganna. At about 2010, this evening,\" he said, \"Councilman\r\nSalgath was murdered.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" She leaned back in the chair, closing her eyes. \"He's dead?\"\r\nThen, again, statement instead of question: \"He's dead!\"\r\n\r\nFor a long moment, she lay back in the chair, as though trying to\r\nreorient her mind to the fact of Salgath Trod's death, while Vall and\r\nDalla sat watching her. Then she stirred, opened her eyes, looked at\r\nthe cigarette in her fingers as though she had never seen it before,\r\nand leaned forward to stuff it into an ash receiver.\r\n\r\n\"Who did it?\" she asked, the Stone Age savage who had been her\r\nancestor not ten generations ago peeping out of her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"The men who actually used the needlers are dead,\" Vall told her. \"I\r\nkilled a couple of them myself. We still have to find the men who\r\nplanned it. I'd hoped you'd want to help us do that, Zinganna.\"\r\n\r\nHe side-glanced to Dalla again; she nodded. The relationship between\r\nZinganna and Salgath Trod hadn't been purely business with her; there\r\nhad been some real affection. He told her what had happened, and when\r\nhe reached the point at which Salgath Trod had called Tortha Karf to\r\nconfess complicity in the slave trade, her lips tightened and she\r\nnodded.\r\n\r\n\"I was afraid it was something like that,\" she said. \"For the last few\r\ndays, well, ever since the news about the slave trade got out, he's\r\nbeen worried about something. I've always thought somebody had some\r\nkind of a hold over him. Different times in the past, he's done things\r\nso far against his own political best interests that I've had to\r\nbelieve he was being forced into them. Well, this time they tried to\r\nforce him too far. What then?\"\r\n\r\nVall continued the story. \"So we're keeping this hushed up, for a\r\nwhile. The way we're letting it out, Salgath Trod is still alive, on\r\nPolice Terminal, talking under narco-hypnosis.\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled savagely. \"And they'll get frightened, and frightened men\r\ndo foolish things,\" she finished. She hadn't been a politician's\r\nmistress for nothing. \"What can I do to help?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell us everything you can,\" he said. \"Maybe we can be able to take\r\nsuch actions as we would have taken if Salgath Trod had lived to talk\r\nto us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, of course.\" She got another cigarette from the case Vall had\r\nlaid on the table. \"I think, though, that you'd better give me a\r\nnarco-hypnosis. You want to be able to depend on what I'm going to\r\ntell you, and I want to be able to remember things exactly.\"\r\n\r\nVall nodded approvingly and turned to Dalla.\r\n\r\n\"Can you handle this, yourself?\" he asked. \"There's an audio-visual\r\nrecorder on now; here's everything you need.\" He opened the drawers in\r\nthe table to show her the narco-hypnotic equipment. \"And the phone has\r\na whisper mouthpiece; you can call out without worrying about your\r\nmessage getting into Zinganna's subconscious. Well, I'll see you when\r\nyou're through; you bring Zinganna to Police Terminal; I'll probably\r\nbe there.\"\r\n\r\nHe went out, closing the door behind him, and went down the hall,\r\nmeeting the officer who had taken charge of the butler and housemaid.\r\n\r\n\"We're having trouble with them, sir,\" he said. \"Hostile. Yelling\r\nabout their rights, and demanding to see a representative of\r\nProletarian Protective League.\"\r\n\r\nVall mentioned the Proletarian Protective League with unflattering\r\nvulgarity.\r\n\r\n\"If they don't coöperate, drag them out and inject them and question\r\nthem anyhow,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThe detective-lieutenant looked worried. \"We've been taking a pretty\r\nhigh hand with them as it is,\" he protested. \"It's safer to kill a\r\nCitizen than bloody a Prole's nose; they have all sorts of laws to\r\nprotect them.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are all sorts of laws to protect the Paratime Secret,\" Vall\r\nreplied. \"And I think there are one or two laws against murdering\r\nmembers of the Executive Council. In case P.P.L. makes any trouble,\r\nthey aren't here; they have faithfully joined their beloved master in\r\nhis refuge on PolTerm. But one or both of them work for the\r\nOrganization.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're sure of that?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Organization is too thorough not to have had a spy in Salgath's\r\nhousehold. It wasn't Zinganna, because she's volunteered to talk to us\r\nunder narco-hyp. So who does that leave?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's different; that makes them suspects.\" The lieutenant\r\nseemed relieved. \"We'll pump that pair out right away.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he got back to Tortha Karf's office, the Chief was awake, and\r\ndoodling on his notepad with his multicolor pen. Vall looked at the\r\npad and winced; the Chief was doodling bugs again--red ants with black\r\nlegs, and blue-and-green beetles. Then he saw that the psychist,\r\nNentrov Dard, was drinking straight 150-proof palm-rum.\r\n\r\n\"Well, tell me the worst,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Our boy's memory-obliterated,\" Nentrov Dard said, draining his glass\r\nand filling it again. \"And he's plastered with pseudo-memories a foot\r\nthick. It'll be five or six ten-days before we can get all that stuff\r\npeeled off and get him unblocked. I put him to sleep and had him\r\ntransposed to Police Terminal. I'm going there, myself, tomorrow\r\nmorning, after I've had some sleep, and get to work on him. If you're\r\nhoping to get anything useful out of him in time to head off this\r\nCouncil crisis that's building up, just forget it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that leaves us right back with our old friends, the Wizard\r\nTraders,\" Tortha Karf added. \"And if they've decided to suspend\r\nactivities on the Kholghoor Sector, too--\" He began drawing a big blue\r\nand black spider in the middle of the pad.\r\n\r\nNentrov Dard crushed out his cigar, drank his rum, and got to his\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n\"Well, good night, Chief; Vall. If you decide to wake me up before\r\n1000, send somebody you want to get rid of in a hurry.\" He walked\r\naround the deck and out the side door.\r\n\r\n\"I hope they don't,\" Vall said to Tortha Karf. \"Really, though, I\r\ndoubt if they do. This is their chance to pick up a lot of slaves\r\ncheaply; the Croutha are too busy to bother haggling. I'm going\r\nthrough to PolTerm, now; when Dalla and Zinganna get through, tell\r\nthem to join me there.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn Police Terminal, he found Kostran Galth, the agent who had been\r\nselected to impersonate Salgath Trod. After calling Zulthran Torv, the\r\nmathematician in charge of the Computer Office and giving him the\r\nEsaron time-line designations and Nentrov Dard's ideas about them, he\r\nspent about an hour briefing Kostran Galth on the role he was to play.\r\nFinally, he undressed and went to bed on a couch in the rest room\r\nbehind the office.\r\n\r\nIt was noon when he woke. After showering, shaving and dressing\r\nhastily, he went out to the desk for breakfast, which arrived while he\r\nwas putting a call through to Ranthar Jard, at Nharkan Equivalent.\r\n\r\n\"Your idea paid off, Chief's Assistant,\" the Kholghoor SecReg Subchief\r\ntold him. \"The slaves gave us a lot of physical description data on\r\nthe estate, and told us about new fields that had been cleared, and a\r\ndam this Lord Ghromdour was building to flood some new rice-paddies.\r\nWe located a belt of about five parayears where these improvements had\r\nbeen made: we started boomeranging the whole belt, time line by time\r\nline. So far, we have ten or fifteen pictures of the main square at\r\nSohram showing Croutha with firearms, and pictures of Wizard Trader\r\ncamps and conveyer heads on the same time lines. Here, let me show\r\nyou; this is from an airboat over the forest outside the equivalent of\r\nSohram.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no jungle visible when the view changed; nothing but\r\nclusters of steel towers and platforms and buildings that marked\r\nconveyer heads, and a large rectangle of red-and-white antigrav-buoys\r\nmoored to warn air traffic out of the area being boomeranged. The\r\npickup seemed to be pointed downward from the bow of an airboat\r\ncircling at about ten thousand feet.\r\n\r\n\"Balls ready to go,\" a voice called, and then repeated a string of\r\ntime-line designations. \"Estimated return, 1820, give or take four\r\nminutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Varth,\" Ranthar Jard said, evidently out of the boat's radio. \"Your\r\ntelecast is being beamed on Dhergabar Equivalent; Chief's Assistant\r\nVerkan is watching. When do you estimate your next return?\"\r\n\r\n\"Any moment, now, sir; we're holding this drop till they\r\nrematerialize.\"\r\n\r\nVall watched unblinkingly, his fork poised halfway to his mouth.\r\nSuddenly, about a thousand feet below the eye of the pickup, there was\r\na series of blue flashes, and, an instant later, a blossoming of\r\nred-and-white parachutes, ejected from the photo-reconnaissance balls\r\nthat had returned from the Kholghoor Sector.\r\n\r\n\"All right; drop away,\" the boat captain called. There was a gush,\r\nfrom underneath, of eight-inch spheres, their conductor-mesh twinkling\r\ngolden-bright in the sunlight. They dropped in a tight cluster for a\r\nthousand or so feet and then flashed and vanished. From the ground,\r\nsix or eight aircars rose to meet the descending parachutes and catch\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe screen went cubist for a moment, and then Ranthar Jard's swarthy,\r\nwide-jawed face looked out of it again. He took his pipe from his\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\n\"We'll probably get a positive out of the batch you just saw coming\r\nin,\" he said. \"We get one out of about every two drops.\"\r\n\r\n\"Message a list of the time-line designations you've gotten so far to\r\nZulthran Torv, at Computer Office here,\" Vall said. \"He's working on\r\nthe Esaron Sector dope; we think a pattern can be established. I'll be\r\nseeing you in about five hours; I'm rocketing out of here as soon as I\r\nget a few more things cleared up here.\"\r\n\r\nZulthran Torv, normally cautious to the degree of pessimism, was\r\njubilant when Vall called him.\r\n\r\n\"We have something, Vall,\" he said. \"It is, roughly, what Dr. Nentrov\r\nsuggested--each of the intervals between the designations is a very\r\nminute but very exact fraction of the difference between lesser\r\ndesignation and the base-line designation.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have the base-line designation?\" Vall demanded.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes. That's what I was telling you. We worked that out from the\r\ndesignations you gave me.\" He recited it. \"All the designations you\r\ngave me are--\"\r\n\r\nVall wasn't listening to him. He frowned in puzzlement.\r\n\r\n\"That's not a Fifth Level designation,\" he said. \"That's First Level!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's correct. First Level Abzar Sector.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now why in blazes didn't anybody think of that before?\" he marveled,\r\nand as he did, he knew the answer. Nobody ever thought of the Abzar\r\nsector.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:]\r\n\r\nTwelve millennia ago, the world of the First Level had been\r\nexhausted; having used up the resources of their home planet, Mars, a\r\nhundred thousand years before, the descendants of the population that\r\nhad migrated across space had repeated on the third planet the\r\ndevastation of the fourth. The ancestors of Verkan Vall's people had\r\ndiscovered the principle of paratime transposition and had begun to\r\nexploit an infinity of worlds on other lines of probability. The\r\npeople of the First Level Dwarma Sector, reduced by sheer starvation\r\nto a tiny handful, had abandoned their cities and renounced their\r\ntechnologies and created for themselves a farm-and-village culture\r\nwithout progress or change or curiosity or struggle or ambition, and a\r\nway of life in which every day was like every other day that had been\r\nor that would come.\r\n\r\nThe Abzar people had done neither. They had wasted their resources to\r\nthe last, fighting bitterly over the ultimate crumbs, with fission\r\nbombs, and with muskets, and with swords, and with spears and clubs,\r\nand finally they had died out, leaving a planet of almost uniform\r\ndesert dotted with vast empty cities which even twelve thousand years\r\nhad hardly begun to obliterate.\r\n\r\nSo nobody on the Paratime Sector went to the Abzar Sector. There was\r\nnothing there--except a hiding-place.\r\n\r\n\"Well, message that to Subchief Ranthar Jard, Kholghoor Sector at\r\nNharkan Equivalent, and to Subchief Vulthor, Esaron Sector, Novilan\r\nEquivalent,\" Vall said. \"And be sure to mark what you send Vulthor,\r\n'Immediate attention Deputy Subchief Skordran.'\"\r\n\r\nThat reminded him of something; as soon as he was through with\r\nZulthran, he got out an order in the name of Tortha Karf authorizing\r\nSkordran Kirv's promotion on a permanent basis and messaged it out.\r\nSomething was going to have to be done with Vulthor Tharn, too. A\r\npromotion of course--say Deputy Bureau Chief. Hypno-Mech Tape Library\r\nat Dhergabar Home Time Line; there Vulthor's passion for procedure and\r\nhis caution would be assets instead of liabilities. He called Vlasthor\r\nArph, the Chief's Deputy assigned to him as adjutant.\r\n\r\n\"I want more troops from ServSec and IndSec,\" he said. \"Go over the\r\nTO's and see what can be spared from where; don't strip any time line,\r\nbut get a force of the order of about three divisions. And locate all\r\nthe big antigrav-equipped ship transposition docks on Commercial and\r\nPassenger Sectors, and a list of freighters and passenger ships that\r\ncan be commandeered in a hurry. We think we've spotted the time line\r\nthe Organization's using as a base. As soon as we raid a couple of\r\nplaces near Nharkan and Novilan Equivalents, we're going to move in\r\nfor a planet-wide cleanup.\"\r\n\r\n\"I get it, Chief's Assistant. I do everything I can to get ready for a\r\nbig move, without letting anything leak out. After you strike the\r\nfirst blow, there won't be any security problem, and the lid will be\r\noff. In the meantime, I make up a general plan, and alert all our own\r\npeople. Right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Right. And for your information, the base isn't Fifth Level; it's\r\nFirst Level Abzar.\" He gave the designation.\r\n\r\nVlasthor Arph chuckled. \"Well, think of that! I'd even forgotten there\r\nwas an Abzar Sector. Shall I tell the reporters that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fangs of Fasif, no!\" Vall fairly howled. Then, curiously: \"What\r\nreporters? How'd they get onto PolTerm?\"\r\n\r\n\"About fifty or sixty news-service people Chief Tortha sent down here,\r\nthis morning, with orders to prevent them from filing any stories from\r\nhere but to let them cover the raids, when they come off. We were\r\ninstructed to furnish them weapons and audio-visual equipment and\r\nvocowriters and anything else they needed, and--\"\r\n\r\nVall grinned. \"That was one I'd never thought of,\" he admitted. \"The\r\nold fox is still the old fox. No, tell them nothing; we'll just take\r\nthem along and show them. Oh, and where are Dr. Hadron Dalla and that\r\ngirl of Salgath Trod's?\"\r\n\r\n\"They're sleeping, now. Rest Room Eighteen.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDalla and Zinganna were asleep on a big mound of silk cushions in one\r\ncorner, their glossy black heads close together and Zinganna's brown\r\narm around Dalla's white shoulder. Their faces were calmly beautiful\r\nin repose, and they smiled slightly, as though they were wandering\r\nthrough a happy dream. For a little while, Vall stood looking at them,\r\nthen he began whistling softly. On the third or fourth bar, Dalla\r\nwoke and sat up, waking Zinganna, and blinked at him perplexedly.\r\n\r\n\"What time is it?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"About 1245,\" he told her.\r\n\r\n\"Ohhh! We just got to sleep,\" she said. \"We're both bushed!\"\r\n\r\n\"You had a hard time. Feel all right after your narco-hyp, Zinganna?\"\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't so bad, and I had a nice sleep. And Dalla ... Dr. Hadron, I\r\nmean--\"\r\n\r\n\"Dalla,\" Vall's wife corrected. \"Remember what I told you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dalla, then,\" Zinganna smiled. \"Dalla gave me some hypno-treatment,\r\ntoo. I don't feel so badly about Trod, any more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, look, Zinganna. We're going to have a man impersonate\r\nCouncilman Salgath on a telecast. The cosmeticians are making him over\r\nnow. Would you find it too painful to meet him, and talk to him?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I wouldn't mind. I can criticize the impersonation; remember, I\r\nknew Trod very well. You know, I was his hostess, too. I met many of\r\nthe people with whom he was associated, and they know me. Would things\r\nlook more convincing if I appeared on the telecast with your man?\"\r\n\r\n\"It certainly would; it would be a great help!\" he told her\r\nenthusiastically. \"Maybe you girls ought to get up, now. The telecast\r\nisn't till 1930, but there's a lot to be done getting ready.\"\r\n\r\nDalla yawned. \"What I get, trying to be a cop,\" she said, then caught\r\nthe other girl's hands and rose, pulling her up. \"Come on, Zinna; we\r\nhave to get to work!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVall rose from behind the reading-screen in Ranthar Jard's office,\r\nstretching his arms over his head. For almost an hour, he had sat there\r\npushing buttons and twiddling selector and magnification-adjustment\r\nknobs, looking at the pictures the Kholghoor-Nharkan cops had taken with\r\nauto-return balls dropped over the spatial equivalent of Sohram. One set\r\nof pictures, taken at two thousand feet, showed the central square of\r\nthe city. The effects of the Croutha sack were plainly visible; so were\r\nthe captives herded together under guard like cattle. By increasing\r\nmagnification, he looked at groups of the barbarian conquerors, big men\r\nwith blond or reddish-brown hair, in loose shirts and baggy trousers and\r\nrough cowhide buskins. Many of them wore bowl-shaped helmets, some had\r\nshirts of ring-mail, all of them carried long straight swords with\r\ncross-hilts, and about half of them had pistols thrust through their\r\nbelts or muskets slung from their shoulders.\r\n\r\nThe other set of pictures showed the Wizard Trader camps and conveyer\r\nheads. In each case, a wide oval had been burned out in the jungle,\r\nprobably with heavy-duty heat guns. The camps were surrounded with\r\nstout wire-mesh fence: in each there were a number of metal\r\nprefab-huts, and an inner fenced slave-pen. A trail had been cut from\r\neach to a similarly cleared circle farther back in the forest, and in\r\nthe centers of one or two of these circles he saw the actual conveyer\r\ndomes. There was a great deal of activity in all of them, and he\r\nscrewed the magnification-adjustment to the limit to scrutinize each\r\nhuman figure in turn. A few of the men, he was sure, were First Level\r\nCitizens; more were either Proles or outtimers. Quite a few of them\r\nwere of a dark, heavy-featured, black-bearded type.\r\n\r\n\"Some of these fellows look like Second Level Khiftans,\" he said.\r\n\"Rush an individual picture of each one, maximum magnification\r\nconsistent with clarity, to Dhergabar Equivalent to be transposed to\r\nHome Time Line. You get all the dope from Zulthran Torv?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; Abzar Sector,\" Ranthar Jard said. \"I'd never have thought of\r\nthat. Wonder why they used that series system, though. I'd have tried\r\nto spot my operations as completely at random as possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only thing they could have done,\" Vall said. \"When we get hold of one\r\nof their conveyers, we're going to find the control panel's just a\r\nmess of arbitrary symbols, and there'll be something like a\r\ncomputer-machine built into the control cabinet, to select the right\r\ntime line whenever a dial's set or a button pushed, and the only way\r\nthat could be done would be by establishing some kind of a numerical\r\nseries. And we were trustingly expecting to locate their base from one\r\nof their conveyers! Why, if we give all those people in the pictures\r\nnarco-hyps, we won't learn the base-line designation; none of them\r\nwill know it. They just go where the conveyers take them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we're all set now,\" Ranthar Jard said. \"I have a plan of attack\r\nworked out; subject to your approval, I'm ready to start implementing\r\nit now.\" He glanced at his watch. \"The Salgath telecast is over, on\r\nHome Time Line, and in a little while, a transcript will be on this\r\ntime line. Want to watch it here, sir?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe telecast screen in the living room of Tortha Karf's town apartment\r\nwas still on; in it, a girl with bright red hair danced slowly to soft\r\nmusic against a background of shifting color. The four men who sat in\r\na semicircle facing it sipped their drinks and watched idly.\r\n\r\n\"Ought to be getting some sort of public reaction soon,\" Tortha Karf\r\nsaid, glancing at his watch.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll have to admit, it was done convincingly,\" Zostha Olv, the\r\nChief Interoffice Coördinator, admitted grudgingly. \"I'd have believed\r\nit, if I hadn't known the real facts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shooting it against the background of those wide windows was smart,\"\r\nLovranth Rolk said. \"Every schoolchild would recognize that view of\r\nthe rocketport as being on Police Terminal. And including that girl\r\nZinganna; that was a real masterpiece!\"\r\n\r\n\"I've met her, a few times,\" Elbraz Vark, the Political Liaison\r\nAssistant, said. \"Isn't she lovely!\"\r\n\r\n\"Good actress, too,\" Tortha Karf said. \"It's not easy to impersonate\r\nyourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Kostran Galth did a fine job of acting, too,\" Lovranth Rolk\r\nsaid. \"That was done to perfection--the distinguished politician,\r\nsupported by his loyal mistress, bravely facing the disgraceful end of\r\nhis public career.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know, I believe I could get that girl a booking with one of the\r\nbig theatrical companies. Now that Salgath's dead, she'll need\r\nsomebody to look after her.\"\r\n\r\n\"What sharp, furry ears you have, Mr. Elbraz!\" Zostha Olv grunted.\r\n\r\nThe music stopped as though cut off with a knife, and the slim girl\r\nwith the red hair vanished in a shatter of many colors. When the\r\nscreen cleared, one of the announcers was looking out of it.\r\n\r\n\"We interrupt the program for an important newscast of a sensational\r\ndevelopment in the Salgath affair,\" he said. \"Your next speaker will\r\nbe Yandar Yadd--\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought you'd managed to get that blabbermouth transposed to\r\nPolTerm,\" Zostha said.\r\n\r\n\"He wouldn't go.\" Tortha Karf replied. \"Said it was just a trick to\r\nget him off Home Time Line during the Council crisis.\"\r\n\r\nYandar Yadd had appeared on the screen as the pickup swung about.\r\n\r\n\"... Recording ostensibly made by Councilman Salgath on Police\r\nTerminal Time Line, and telecast on Home Time Line an hour ago. Well,\r\nI don't know who he was, but I now have positive proof that he\r\ndefinitely was not Salgath Trod!\"\r\n\r\n\"We're sunk!\" Zostha Olv grunted. \"He'd never make a statement like\r\nthat unless he could prove it.\"\r\n\r\n\"... Something suspicious about the whole thing, from the beginning,\"\r\nthe newsman was saying. \"So I checked. If you recall, the actor\r\nimpersonating Salgath gestured rather freely with his hands, in\r\nimitation of a well-known mannerism of the real Salgath Trod; at one\r\npoint, the ball of his right thumb was presented directly to the\r\npickup. Here's a still of that scene.\"\r\n\r\nHe stepped aside, revealing a viewscreen behind him; when he pressed a\r\nbutton, the screen lighted; on it was a stationary picture of Kostran\r\nGalth as Salgath Trod, his right hand raised in front of him.\r\n\r\n\"Now watch this. I'm going to step up the magnification, slowly, so\r\nthat you can be sure there's no substitution. Camera a little closer,\r\nTrath!\"\r\n\r\nThe screen in the background seemed to advance, until it filled the\r\nentire screen. Yandar Yadd was still talking, out of the picture; a\r\nmetal-tipped pointer came into the picture, touching the right thumb,\r\nwhich grew larger and larger until it was the only thing visible.\r\n\r\n\"Now here,\" Yandar Yadd's voice continued. \"Any of you who are\r\nfamiliar with the ancient science of dactyloscopy will recognize this\r\nthumb as having the ridge-pattern known as a 'twin loop.' Even with\r\nthe high degree of magnification possible with the microgrid screen,\r\nwe can't bring out the individual ridges, but the pattern is\r\nunmistakable. I ask you to memorize that image, while I show you\r\nanother right thumb print, this time a certified photo-copy of the\r\nthumb print of the real Salgath Trod.\" The magnification was reduced a\r\nlittle, a card was moved into the picture, and it was stepped up\r\nagain. \"See, this thumb print is of the type known as a 'tented arch.'\r\nObserve the difference.\"\r\n\r\n\"That does it!\" Zostha Olv cried. \"Karf, for the first and last time,\r\nlet me remind you that I opposed this lunacy from the beginning. Now,\r\nwhat are we going to do next?\"\r\n\r\n\"I suggest that we get to Headquarters as soon as we can,\" Tortha Karf\r\nsaid. \"If we wait too long, we may not be able to get in.\"\r\n\r\nYandar Yadd was back on the screen, denouncing Tortha Karf\r\npassionately. Tortha went over and snapped it off.\r\n\r\n\"I suggest we transpose to PolTerm,\" Lovranth Rolk said. \"It won't be\r\nso easy for them to serve a summons on us there.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can go to PolTerm if you want to,\" Tortha Karf retorted. \"I'm\r\ngoing to stay here and fight back, and if they try to serve me with a\r\nsummons, they'd better send a robot for a process server.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fight back!\" Zostha Olv echoed. \"You can't fight the Council and the\r\nwhole Management! They'll tear you into inch bits!\"\r\n\r\n\"I can hold them off till Vall's able to raid those Abzar Sector\r\nbases,\" Tortha Karf said. He thought for a moment. \"Maybe this is all\r\nfor the best, after all. If it distracts the Organization's\r\nattention--\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"I wish we could have made a boomerang-ball reconnaissance,\" Ranthar\r\nJard was saying, watching one of the viewscreens, in which a film,\r\ntaken from an airboat transposed to an adjoining Abzar sector time\r\nline, was being shown. The boat had circled over the Ganges, a mere\r\ntrickle between wide, deeply cut banks, and was crossing a gullied\r\nplain, sparsely grown with thornbush. \"The base ought to be about\r\nthere, but we have no idea what sort of changes this gang has made.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we couldn't: we didn't dare take the chance of it being\r\nspotted. This has to be a complete surprise. It'll be about like the\r\nother place, the one the slaves described. There won't be any\r\npermanent buildings. This operation only started a few months ago,\r\nwith the Croutha invasion; it may go on for four or five months, till\r\nthe Croutha have all their surplus captives sold off. That country,\"\r\nhe added, gesturing at the screen, \"will be flooded out when the rains\r\ncome. See how it's suffered from flood-erosion. There won't be a thing\r\nthere that can't be knocked down and transposed out in a day or so.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish you'd let me go along,\" Ranthar Jard worried.\r\n\r\n\"We can't do that, either,\" Vall said. \"Somebody's got to be in charge\r\nhere, and you know your own people better than I do. Beside, this\r\nwon't be the last operation like this. Next time, I'll have to stay on\r\nPolice Terminal and command from a desk; I want first-hand experience\r\nwith the outtime end of the job, and this is the only way I can get\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nHe watched the four police-girls who were working at the big terrain\r\nboard showing the area of the Police Terminal time line around them.\r\nThey had covered the miniature buildings and platforms and towers with\r\na fine mesh, at a scale-equivalent of fifty feet; each intersection\r\nmarked the location of a three-foot conveyer ball, loaded with a\r\nsleep-gas bomb and rigged with an automatic detonator which would\r\nexplode it and release the gas as soon as it rematerialized on the\r\nAbzar Sector. Higher, on stiff wires that raised them to what\r\nrepresented three thousand feet, were the disks that stood for ten\r\nhundred-foot conveyers; they would carry squads of Paratime Police in\r\naircars and thirty-foot air boats. There was a ring of big\r\ntwo-hundred-foot conveyers a mile out; they would carry the armor and\r\nthe airborne infantry and the little two-man scooters of the\r\nair-cavalry, from the Service and Industrial Sectors. Directly over\r\nthe spatial equivalent of the Kholghoor Sector Wizard Traders'\r\nconveyers was the single disk of Verkan Vall's command conveyer, at a\r\nrepresented five thousand feet, and in a half-mile circle around it\r\nwere the five news service conveyers.\r\n\r\n\"Where's the ship-conveyer?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Actually it's on antigrav about five miles north of here,\" one of the\r\ngirls said. \"Representationally, about where Subchief Ranthar's\r\nstanding.\"\r\n\r\nAnother girl added a few more bits to the network that represented the\r\nsleep-gas bombs and stepped back, taking off her earphones.\r\n\r\n\"Everything's in place, now, Assistant Verkan,\" she told him.\r\n\r\n\"Good. I'm going aboard, now,\" he said. \"You can have it, Jard.\"\r\n\r\nHe shook hands with Ranthar Jard, who moved to the switch which would\r\nactivate all the conveyers simultaneously, and accepted the good\r\nwishes of the girls at the terrain board. Then he walked to the\r\nmesh-covered dome of the hundred-foot conveyer, with the five news\r\nservice conveyers surrounding it in as regular a circle as the\r\nbuildings and towers of the regular conveyer heads would permit. The\r\nmembers of his own detail, smoking and chatting outside, saw him and\r\nstarted moving inside; so did the news people. A public-address\r\nspeaker began yelping, in a hundred voices all over the area, warning\r\nthose who were going with the conveyers to get aboard. He went in\r\nthrough a door, between two aircars, and on to the central\r\ncontrol-desks, going up to a visiscreen over which somebody had\r\ncrayoned \"Novilan EQ.\" It gave him a view, over the shoulder of a man\r\nin the uniform of a field agent third class, of the interior of a\r\nconveyer like his own.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Assistant Verkan,\" a voice came out of the speaker under the\r\nscreen, as the man moved his lips. \"Deputy Skordran! Here's Chief's\r\nAssistant Verkan, now!\"\r\n\r\nSkordran Kirv moved in front of the screen as the operator got up from\r\nhis stool.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Vall; we're all set to move out as soon as you give the word,\"\r\nhe said. \"We're all in position on antigrav.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's smart work. We've just finished our gas-bomb net,\" Vall said.\r\n\"Going on antigrav now,\" he added, as he felt the dome lift. \"I hope\r\nyou won't be too disappointed if you draw a blank on your end.\"\r\n\r\n\"We realize that they've closed out the whole Esaron Sector,\" Skordran\r\nKirv, eight thousand odd miles away, replied. \"We're taking in a\r\ncouple of ships; we're going to make a survey all up the coast. There\r\nare a lot of other sectors where slaves can be sold in this area.\"\r\n\r\nIn the outside viewscreen, tuned to a slowly rotating pickup on the\r\ntop of a tower spatially equivalent with a room in a tall building on\r\nSecond Level Triplanetary Empire Sector, he could see his own conveyer\r\nrising vertically, with the news conveyers following, and the troop\r\nconveyers, several miles away, coming into position. Finally, they\r\nwere all placed; he reported the fact to Skordran Kirv and then picked\r\nup a hand-phone.\r\n\r\n\"Everybody ready for transposition?\" he called. \"On my count. Thirty\r\nseconds ... Twenty seconds ... Fifteen seconds ... Five seconds ...\r\nFour seconds ... Three seconds ... Two seconds ... One second, _out!_\"\r\n\r\nAll the screens went gray. The inside of the dome passed into another\r\nspace-time continuum, even into another kind of space-time. The\r\ntransposition would take half an hour; that seemed to be the time\r\nneeded to build up and collapse the transposition field, regardless of\r\nthe paratemporal distance covered. The dome above and around them\r\nvanished; the bare, tower-forested, building-dotted world of Police\r\nTerminal vanished, too, into the uniform green of the uninhabited\r\nFifth Level. A planet could take pretty good care of itself, he\r\nthought, if people would only leave it alone. Then he began to see the\r\nfields and villages of Fourth Level. Cities appeared and vanished,\r\ngrowing higher and vaster as they went across the more civilized Third\r\nLevel. One was under air attack--there was almost never a paratemporal\r\ntransposition which did not run through some scene of battle.\r\n\r\nHe unbuckled his belt and took off his boots and tunic; all around\r\nhim, the others were doing the same. Sleep-gas didn't have to be\r\nbreathed; it could enter the nervous system by any orifice or lesion,\r\neven a pore or a scratch. A spacesuit was the only protection. One of\r\nthe detectives helped him on with his metal and plastic armor; before\r\nsealing his gauntlets, he reciprocated the assistance, then checked\r\nthe needler and blaster and the long batonlike ultrasonic paralyzer on\r\nhis belt and made sure that the radio and sound-phones in his helmet\r\nwere working. He hoped that the frantic efforts to gather several\r\nthousand spacesuits onto Police Terminal from the Industrial and\r\nCommercial and Interplanetary Sectors hadn't started rumors which had\r\ngotten to the ears of some of the Organization's ubiquitous agents.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe country below was already turning to the parched browns and\r\nyellows of the Abzar Sector. There was not another of the conveyers in\r\nsight, but electronic and mechanical lag in the individual controls\r\nand even the distance-difference between them and the central radio\r\ncontrol would have prevented them from going into transposition at the\r\nsame fractional microsecond. The recon-details began piling into their\r\ncars. Then the red light overhead winked to green, and the dome\r\nflickered and solidified into cold, inert metal. The screens lighted\r\nup again, and Vall could see Skordran Kirv, across Asia and the\r\nPacific, getting into his helmet. A dot of light in the center of the\r\nunderview screen widened as the mesh under the conveyer irised open\r\naround the pickup.\r\n\r\nBelow, the Organization base--big rectangles of fenced slave pens,\r\nwith metal barracks inside; the huge circle of the Kholghoor Sector\r\nconveyer-head building, and a smaller structure that must house\r\nconveyers to other Abzar Sector time lines; the work-shops and living\r\nquarters and hangars and warehouses and docks--was wreathed in\r\nwhite-green mist. The ring of conveyers at three thousand feet were\r\nopening and spewing out aircars and airboats, farther away, the\r\ngreater ring of heavy conveyers were unloading armored and shielded\r\ncombat-craft. An aircar which must have been above the reach of the\r\ngas was streaking away toward the west, with three police cars after\r\nit. As he watched, the air around it fairly sizzled blue with the rays\r\nof neutron disruption blasters, and then it blew apart. The three\r\npolice cars turned and came back more slowly. The three-thousand-ton\r\npassenger ship which had been hastily fitted with armament was\r\ncircling about; the great dock conveyer which had brought it was gone,\r\ntransposed back to Police Terminal to pick up another ship.\r\n\r\nHe recorded a message announcing the arrival of the task-force, pulled\r\nout the tape and sealed it in a capsule, and put the capsule in a mesh\r\nmessage ball, attaching it to a couple of wires and flipping a switch.\r\nThe ball flashed and vanished, leaving the wires cleanly sheared off.\r\nWhen it got back to Police Terminal, half an hour later, it would\r\nrematerialize, eject a parachute, and turn on a whistle to call\r\nattention to itself. Then he sealed on his helmet, climbed into an\r\naircar, and turned on his helmet-radio to speak to the driver. The car\r\nlifted a few inches, floated out an open port, and dived downward.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration:]\r\n\r\nHe landed at the big conveyer-head building. There were spaces for\r\nfifty conveyers around it, and all but eight of them were in place.\r\nOne must have arrived since the gas bombs burst; it was crammed with\r\nsenseless Kharanda slaves. A couple of Paratime Police officers were\r\ntowing a tank of sleep-gas around on an antigrav-lifter, maintaining\r\nthe proper concentration in case any more came in. At the smaller\r\nconveyer building, there were no conveyers, only a number of red-lined\r\nfifty-foot circles around a central two-hundred-foot circle. The\r\nOrganization personnel there had been dragged outside, and a group of\r\nparacops were sealing it up, installing robot watchmen, and preparing\r\nto flood it with gas. At the slave pens, a string of two-hundred-foot\r\nconveyers, having unloaded soldiers and fighting-gear, were coming in\r\nto take on unconscious slaves for transposition to Police Terminal.\r\nAircars and airboats were bringing in gassed slavers; they were being\r\nshackled and dumped into the slave barracks; as soon as the gas\r\ncleared and they could be brought back to consciousness, they would be\r\nnarco-hypnotized and questioned.\r\n\r\nHe had finished a tour of the warehouses, looking at the kegs of\r\ngunpowder and the casks of brandy, the piles of pig lead, the stacks\r\nof cases containing muskets. These must have all come from some\r\nlow-order handcraft time line. Then there were swords and hatchets\r\nand knives that had been made on Industrial Sector--the Organization\r\nmust be getting them through some legitimate trading company--and\r\nmirrors and perfumes and synthetic fiber textiles and cheap jewelry,\r\nof similar provenance. It looked as though this stuff had been brought\r\nin by ship from somewhere else on this time line; the warehouses were\r\ntoo far from the conveyers and right beside the ship dock--\r\n\r\nThere was a tremendous explosion somewhere. Vall and the men with him\r\nran outside, looking about, the sound-phones of their helmets giving\r\nthem no idea of the source of the sound. One of the policemen pointed,\r\nand Vall's eyes followed his arm. The ship that had been transposed in\r\nin the big conveyer was falling, blown in half; as he looked, both\r\nsections hit the ground several miles away. A strange ship, a\r\nfreighter, was coming in fast, and as he watched, a blue spark winked\r\nfrom her bow as a heavy-duty blaster was activated. There was another\r\nexplosion, overhead; they all ran for shelter as Vall's\r\ncommand-conveyer disintegrated into falling scrap-metal. At once, all\r\nthe other conveyers which were on antigrav began flashing and\r\nvanishing. That was the right, the only, thing to do, he knew. But it\r\nwas leaving him and his men isolated and under attack.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"So that was it,\" Dalgroth Sorn, the Paratime Commissioner for\r\nSecurity said, relieved when Tortha Karf had finished.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and I'll repeat it under narco-hyp, too,\" Tortha Karf added.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't talk that way, Karf,\" Dalgroth Sorn scolded. He was at\r\nleast a century Tortha Karf's senior; he had the face of an elderly\r\nand sore-toothed lion. \"You wanted to keep this prisoner under wraps\r\ntill you could mind-pump him, and you wanted the Organization to think\r\nSalgath was alive and talking. I approve both. But--\"\r\n\r\nHe gestured to the viewscreen across the room, tuned to a pickup back\r\nof the Speaker's chair in the Council Chamber. Tortha Karf turned a\r\nknob to bring the sound volume up.\r\n\r\n\"Well. I'm raising this point,\" a member from the Management seats in\r\nthe center was saying, \"because these earlier charges of illegal\r\narrest and illegal detention are part and parcel with the charges\r\ngrowing out of the telecast last evening.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that telecast was a fake; that's been established,\" somebody on\r\nthe left heckled.\r\n\r\n\"Councilman Salgath's confession on the evening of One-Six-Two Day\r\nwasn't a fake, the Management supporter, Nanthav Skov, retorted.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then why was it necessary to fake the second one?\"\r\n\r\nA light began winking on the big panel in front of the Speaker, Asthar\r\nVarn.\r\n\r\n\"I recognize Councilman Hasthor Flan,\" Asthar said.\r\n\r\n\"I believe I can construct a theory that will explain that,\" Hasthor\r\nFlan said. \"I suggest that when the Paratime Police were questioning\r\nCouncilman Salgath under narco-hypnosis, he made statements\r\nincriminating either the Paratime Police as a whole or some member of\r\nthe Paratime Police whom Tortha Karf had to protect--say somebody like\r\nAssistant Verkan. So they just killed him, and made up this\r\nimpostor--\"\r\n\r\nTortha Karf began, alphabetically, to blaspheme every god he had ever\r\nheard of. He had only gotten as far as a Fourth Level deity named\r\nAllah when a red light began flashing in front of Asthar Varn, and the\r\nvoice of a page-robot, amplified, roared:\r\n\r\n\"Point of special urgency! Point of special urgency! It has been\r\nrequested that the news telecast screen be activated at once, with\r\nplayback to 1107. An important bulletin has just come in from\r\nNagorabar, Home Time Line, on the Indian subcontinent--\"\r\n\r\n\"You can stop swearing, now, Karf,\" Dalgroth Sorn grinned. \"I think\r\nthis is it.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKostran Galth sat on the edge of the couch, with one arm around\r\nZinganna's waist; on the other side of him, Hadron Dalla lay at full\r\nlength, her elbows propped and her chin in her hands. The screen in\r\nfront of them showed a fading sunset, although it was only a little\r\npast noon at Dhergabar Equivalent. A dark ship was coming slowly in\r\nagainst the red sky; in the center of a wire-fenced compound a\r\nhundred-foot conveyer hung on antigrav twenty feet from the ground,\r\nand beyond, a long metal prefab-shed was spilling light from open\r\ndoors and windows.\r\n\r\n\"That crowd that was just taken in won't be finished for a couple of\r\nhours,\" a voice was saying. \"I don't know how much they'll be able to\r\ntell; the psychists say they're all telling about the same stories.\r\nWhat those stories are, of course, I'm not able to repeat. After the\r\ntrouble caused by a certain news commentator who shall be\r\nnameless--he's not connected with this news service, I'm happy to\r\nsay--we're all leaning over backward to keep from breaking Paratime\r\nPolice security.\r\n\r\n\"One thing; shortly after the arrival of the second ship from Police\r\nTerminal--and believe me, that ship came in just in the nick of\r\ntime!--the dead Abzar city which the criminals were using as their\r\nmain base for this time line, and from which they launched the air\r\nattack against us, was located, and now word has come in that it is\r\nentirely in the hands of the Paratime Police. Personally, I doubt if a\r\ngreat deal of information has been gotten from any prisoners taken\r\nthere. The lengths to which this Organization went to keep their own\r\npeople in ignorance is simply unbelievable.\"\r\n\r\nA man appeared for a moment in the lighted doorway of the shed, then\r\nstepped outside.\r\n\r\n\"Look!\" Dalla cried. \"There's Vall!\"\r\n\r\n\"There's Assistant Verkan, now,\" the commentator agreed. \"Chief's\r\nAssistant, would you mind saying a few words, here? I know you're a\r\nbusy man, sir, but you are also the public hero of Home Time Line, and\r\neverybody will be glad if you say something to them--\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTortha Karf sealed the door of the apartment behind them, then\r\nactivated one of the robot servants and sent it gliding out of the\r\nroom for drinks. Verkan Vall took off his belt and holster and laid\r\nthem aside, then dropped into a deep chair with a sigh of relief.\r\nDalla advanced to the middle of the room and stood looking about in\r\nsurprised delight.\r\n\r\n\"Didn't expect this, from the mess outside?\" Vall asked. \"You know,\r\nyou really are on the paracops, now. Nobody off the Force knows about\r\nthis hideout of the Chief's.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd better find a place like this, too,\" Tortha Karf advised. \"From\r\nnow on, you'll have about as much privacy at that apartment in\r\nTurquoise Towers as you'd enjoy on the stage of Dhergabar Opera\r\nHouse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just what is my new position?\" Vall asked, hunting his cigarette case\r\nout of his tunic. \"Duplicate Chief of Paratime Police?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe robot came back with three tall glasses and a refrigerated\r\ndecanter on its top. It stopped in front of Tortha Karf and slewed\r\naround on its treads; he filled a glass and sent it to the chair where\r\nDalla had seated herself; when she got a drink, she sent it to Vall.\r\nVall sent if back to Tortha Karf, who turned it off.\r\n\r\n\"No; you have the modifier in the wrong place. You're Chief of\r\nDuplicate Paratime Police. You take the setup you have now, and expand\r\nit; continue the present lines of investigation, and be ready to\r\nexploit anything new that comes up. You won't bother with any of this\r\nroutine flying-saucer-scare stuff; just handle the Organization\r\nbusiness. That'll keep you busy for a long time, I'm afraid.\"\r\n\r\n\"I notice you slammed down on the first Council member who began\r\nshouting about how you'd wiped out the Great Paratemporal Crime-Ring,\"\r\nVall said.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. It isn't wiped out, and it won't be wiped out for a long time. I\r\nshall be unspeakably delighted if, when I turn my job over to you, you\r\nhave it wiped out. And even then, there'll be a loose end to pick up\r\nevery now and then till you retire.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have Council and the Management with us, now,\" Vall said. \"This\r\nwas the first secret session of Executive Council in over two thousand\r\nyears. And I thought I'd drop dead when they passed that motion to\r\nsubmit themselves to narco-hypnosis.\"\r\n\r\n\"A few Councilmen are going to drop dead before they can be\r\nnarco-hypped,\" Dalla prophesied over the rim of her glass.\r\n\r\n\"A few have already. I have a list of about a dozen of them who have\r\nhad fatal accidents or committed suicide, or just died or vanished\r\nsince the news of your raid broke. Four of them I saw, in the screen,\r\njump up and run out as soon as the news came in, on One-Six-Five Day.\r\nAnd a lot of other people; our friend Yandar Yadd's dropped out of\r\nsight, for one. You heard what we got out of those servants of Salgath\r\nTrod's?\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't,\" Dalla said. \"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"Both spies for the Organization. They reported to a woman named\r\nFarilla, who ran a fortune-telling parlor in the Prole district. Her\r\noccult powers didn't warn her before we sent a squad of plain-clothes\r\nmen for her. That was an entirely illegal arrest, by the way, but it\r\nnetted us a list of about three hundred prominent political, business\r\nand social persons whose servants have been reporting to her. She\r\nthought she was working for a telecast gossipist.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's why we have a new butler, darling,\" Vall interrupted.\r\n\"Kandagro was reporting on us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who did she pass the reports on to?\" Dalla asked.\r\n\r\nTortha Karf beamed. \"She thinks more like a cop every time I talk to\r\nher,\" he told Vall. \"You better appoint her your Special Assistant.\r\nWhy, about 1800 every day, some Prole would come in, give the\r\nrecognition sign, and get the day's accumulation. We only got one of\r\nthem, a fourteen-year-old girl. We're having some trouble getting her\r\ndeconditioned to a point where she can be hypnotized into talking; by\r\nthe time we do, they'll have everything closed out, I suppose. What's\r\nthe latest from Abzar Sector? I missed the last report in the rush to\r\nget to this Council session.\"\r\n\r\n\"All stalled. We're still boomeranging the sector, but it's about five\r\nbillion time-lines deep, and the pattern for the Kholghoor and Esaron\r\nSectors doesn't seem to apply. I think they have a lot of these Abzar\r\ntime lines close together, and they get from one to another via some\r\nterminal on Fifth Level.\"\r\n\r\nTortha Karf nodded. It was impossible to make a transposition of less\r\nthan ten parayears--a hundred thousand time lines. It was impossible\r\nthat the field could build and collapse that soon.\r\n\r\n\"We also think that this Abzar time line was only used for the\r\nCroutha-Wizard Trader operation. Nothing we found there was more than\r\na couple of months old; nothing since the last rainy season in India,\r\nfor instance. Everything was cleaned out on Skordran Kirv's end.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell him to try the Mississippi, Missouri and Ohio Valleys,\" Tortha\r\nKarf said. \"A lot of those slaves are sure to have been sold to Second\r\nLevel Khiftan Sector.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it looks as though our vacation's out the window for a long\r\ntime,\" Dalla said resignedly.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you and Vall go to my farm, on Fifth Level Sicily,\" Tortha\r\nKarf suggested. \"I own the whole island, on that time line, and you\r\ncan always be reached in a hurry if anything comes up.\"\r\n\r\n\"We could have as much fun there as on the Dwarma Sector,\" Dalla\r\nsaid. \"Chief, could we take a couple of friends along?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, who?\"\r\n\r\n\"Zinganna and Kostran Galth,\" she replied. \"They've gotten interested\r\nin one another; they're talking about a tentative marriage.\"\r\n\r\n\"It'll have to be mighty tentative,\" Vall said. \"Kostran Galth can't\r\nmarry a Prole.\"\r\n\r\n\"She won't be a Prole very long. I'm going to adopt her as my sister.\"\r\n\r\nTortha Karf looked at her sharply. \"You sure you know what you're\r\ndoing, Dalla?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Of course I'm sure. I know that girl better than she knows herself. I\r\nnarco-hypped her, remember. Zinna's the kind of a sister I've always\r\nwished I'd had.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's all right then. But about this marriage. She was in love\r\nwith Salgath Trod,\" Tortha Karf said. \"Now, she's identifying Agent\r\nKostran with him--\"\r\n\r\n\"She was in love with the kind of man Salgath could have been if he\r\nhadn't gotten into this Organization filth,\" Dalla replied. \"Galth is\r\nthat kind of a man. They'll get along all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, she'll qualify on IQ and general psych rating for Citizenship.\r\nI'll say that. And she's the kind of girl I like to see my boys take\r\nup with. Like you, Dalla. Yes, of course; take them along with you.\r\nSicily's big enough that two couples won't get in each others' way.\"\r\n\r\nA phone-robot, its slender metal stem topped by a metal globe, slid\r\ninto the room on its ball-rollers, moving falteringly, like a blind\r\nman. It could sense Tortha Karf's electro-encephalic wave-patterns,\r\nbut it was having trouble locating the source. They all sat\r\nmotionless, waiting; finally it came over to Tortha Karf's chair and\r\nstopped. He unhooked the phone and held a lengthy whispered\r\nconversation with somebody before replacing it.\r\n\r\n\"Now, there,\" he explained to Dalla. \"That's a sample of why we have\r\nto set up this duplicate organization. Revolution just broke out at\r\nFtanna, on Third Level Tsorshay Sector; a lot of our people, mostly\r\ntourists and students, are cut off from their conveyers by street\r\nfighting. Going to be a pretty bloody business getting them out.\" He\r\nfinished his drink and got to his feet. \"Sit still; I just have to\r\nmake a few screen-calls. Send the robot for something to eat, Vall.\r\nI'll be right back.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END",
