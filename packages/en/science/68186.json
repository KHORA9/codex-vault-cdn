Human Reason is confounded by Instinct thus raised to\r\n    the highest pitch of which Nature can offer an example, and the\r\n    perturbation of intelligence increases on observing, patiently and\r\n    minutely, the details of the life of those creatures most highly\r\n    endowed with instinct.\r\n\r\n                                                          E.

Reprinted 1913\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThis little volume introduces the work of a great French naturalist to\r\nthe reader of English. Réaumur, another Frenchman, is the greatest\r\nnaturalist devoting himself to the observation of insects the world has\r\nyet seen. His six quarto volumes—Mémoires pour servir à l’histoire des\r\ninsectes—were published between 1734 and 1742. J.-H. Fabre, who happily\r\nis still with us, is second only to Réaumur in this part of the great\r\nfield of Natural History.\r\n\r\nThough compatriots the two men are remarkably different in the nature\r\nof their genius. Réaumur, stately and slow, both discursive and\r\ndiffuse. Fabre,—styled by Charles Darwin the immortal Fabre,—a most\r\npatient, indefatigable observer, ready to sacrifice everything to the\r\ncarrying on of his work, but making deductions too rapidly from his\r\nobservations, and taking a philosophical position from which he refuses\r\nto budge, even though he stand alone among the naturalists of this\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\nFabre’s great merit is his graphic portraiture of the living insect as\r\nit really is. This proves to be very different from insect life as it\r\nis usually supposed to be by the uninstructed, and as it is only too\r\nfrequently represented to be in books. In the volume now offered to the\r\nreader he is almost entirely concerned with the instinct of\r\nHymenoptera, the highest of the insect world in this respect. His\r\nstudies of this subject have been continued in several other volumes,\r\nand he has also included in the series the results of many years of\r\nobservation of the habits of other and very different insects.\r\n\r\nHis philosophical position may be briefly stated to be a determined\r\nrefusal to recognise evolution as a legitimate idea. In this we may\r\nthink him wrong; but it must be admitted that his views form a valuable\r\nantithesis to those of the many evolutionists who take the position\r\nthat all that remains for the naturalist to do is to repeat the words\r\nNatural Selection and variation, and declare that thereby we understand\r\nthe Cosmos.\r\n\r\nFabre is a difficult writer to translate. Probably no one has ever\r\nwritten on this subject with equal brilliancy and vivacity. But he is\r\nthe most Gallic of Frenchmen. If his words are literally translated,\r\nthey scarcely make English; if freely translated, the charm of his\r\ndiction is too easily missed.\r\n\r\nWe hope that this volume may induce the student to read Fabre’s\r\nsubsequent volumes. [1] Taken altogether they are, if not superior, at\r\nleast not inferior to this one—preferred simply because it is the first\r\nof the series.\r\n\r\nIn his works there is a good deal of delightful autobiography. Starting\r\nas a child amidst the direst poverty, he has become a highly\r\naccomplished man, a great naturalist, a brilliant writer; and he has\r\ndone this with a complete contempt for money, and a great indifference\r\nto the other rewards that Society is ready to bestow for such work.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                              D.

We were five or six, I the oldest and their\r\nprofessor, still more their comrade and friend; they, young fellows\r\nwith warm hearts and lively imaginations, overflowing with that\r\nyouthful vitality which makes one so open to impressions and so eager\r\nfor knowledge.\r\n\r\nTalking of one thing and another we followed a path bordered with elder\r\nand hawthorn, where already the Rose Beetle was revelling in the\r\noverwhelming scent of the clustering blossoms. We were going to see if\r\nthe Sacred Scarabæus had yet appeared on the sandy plateau of Les\r\nAngles, rolling the ball of dung which ancient Egypt looked on as\r\nemblematic of the world; we wanted to discover whether the running\r\nstream at the bottom of the hill might not hide young newts under the\r\nnet of water weeds—newts whose branchiæ look like tiny sprays of coral;\r\nto see if that elegant little fish of the rivulet, the stickleback, had\r\ndonned his wedding cravat of azure and purple; if the new-come swallows\r\nwere dipping on pointed wings over the meadows chasing the midges which\r\nscatter their eggs in their airy dance; to see if the Eyed Lizard was\r\nsunning his blue-spotted body at the mouth of a hole made in the\r\nsandstone; or if the flocks of Laughing Gulls, come up from the sea\r\nafter the legions of fish which ascend the Rhône to spawn, were\r\nhovering over the river, and now and again uttering their cry like the\r\nlaugh of a maniac. But enough; suffice it to say that, like simple folk\r\nwho find much pleasure in living with the brute creation, we were\r\nintending to spend a morning in enjoying the ineffable awakening of\r\nlife in springtime.\r\n\r\nWe were not disappointed. The stickleback was in full dress, his scales\r\nwould have made silver look dim; his throat was of the brightest\r\nvermilion. On the approach of a great horse-leech with no good\r\nintentions, up rose the spines on back and side as if moved by a\r\nspring. Thus bravely encountered, the bandit beat an ignominious\r\nretreat down among the water-plants. The dull race of molluscs,\r\nPlanorbinæ, and water-snails were sucking in air on the surface of the\r\nwater, and the great Water Beetle, with its hideous larva, went by\r\nwringing the neck now of one, now of another, without the stupid band\r\nseeming to notice it. But let us leave the waters of the plain and\r\nclimb the steep cliff dividing us from the tableland where sheep are\r\nfeeding and horses are being exercised for the approaching races, one\r\nand all bestowing largesse on the rejoicing dung beetles.\r\n\r\nFor here at work are the scavenger beetles to whom is entrusted the\r\nhigh office of clearing the ground of impurities. It is impossible to\r\nadmire sufficiently the variety of tools with which they are furnished,\r\nboth to stir the dung with, to divide and shape it, and to hollow the\r\ndeep retreats into which they shut themselves with their booty. These\r\ntools form a kind of technological museum, where there is a specimen of\r\nevery kind of digging instrument. Some might be copied from those\r\ndevised by human industry, others are of an original type, and might\r\nserve as models for new tools for man. Copris hispanica wears a strong\r\nhorn on its head, forked and bent back, like the long spike of a\r\npickaxe. To a similar horn C. lunaris adds two strong points, shaped\r\nliked a ploughshare, projecting from the thorax, and between them a\r\nsharp-edged protuberance, serving as a wide rake. Bubas bubalus and B.\r\nbison, both exclusively Mediterranean species, have foreheads armed\r\nwith two stout, diverging horns, between which projects a horizontal\r\nshare from the corslet. Geotrupes typhæus carries three points on the\r\nfront of its thorax, parallel and standing straight out, the middle one\r\nshorter than the others. Onthophagus taurus owns as implements two long\r\ncurving appendages like the horns of a bull, while the furcate\r\nOnthophagus has a two-pronged fork on its flat head. Even those least\r\nwell off have on one part or other hard tubercules—tools blunt indeed,\r\nbut which the patient insect knows very well how to utilise. All are\r\nfurnished with a shovel, i.e. a large, flat, sharp-edged head; all use\r\na rake—in other words, they collect materials with their toothed front\r\nlegs.\r\n\r\nAs compensation for their unpleasant work, more than one gives out a\r\nstrong scent of musk, and its ventral parts gleam like polished metal.\r\nGeotrupes hypocrita has the under part of its body bright with metallic\r\nlights of copper and gold, and G. stercorarius with amethystine violet.\r\nBut the usual colour is black. It is in tropical regions that we find\r\ndung beetles in gorgeous array—absolutely living jewels. Under camel\r\ndroppings in Upper Egypt is found a beetle rivalling the dazzling green\r\nof an emerald; Guiana, Brazil, Senegal, can show Copridæ of a metallic\r\nred, rich as the red of copper, bright as that of a ruby. If such a\r\njewelled race be wanting to our country, still its dung beetles are not\r\nless remarkable for their habits.\r\n\r\nWhat eagerness is displayed around a dropping! Never did adventurers\r\nfrom the four corners of the world show such eagerness in working a\r\nCalifornian claim! Before the sun grows too hot there they are by\r\nhundreds, large and small, pell-mell, of every kind and form and shape,\r\nhastening to secure a slice of the cake! Some work in the open air and\r\nrake the surface, some open galleries in the thickest part, seeking\r\nchoice morsels, others toil in the under part and bury their treasure\r\nas soon as possible in the adjacent ground, and the smallest crumble\r\nsome scrap fallen from the excavations of their strong fellow-workers.\r\nSome again—newcomers, and doubtless the hungriest—eat then and there,\r\nbut the aim of the greater number is to lay up a store which will allow\r\nthem to pass long days of plenty down in some sure retreat. A fresh\r\ndropping is not to be found just when wanted in a plain where no thyme\r\ngrows; such a gift is indeed a piece of good fortune, and only comes to\r\nthe lucky. So when found, the wealth is prudently stored. The smell has\r\ncarried the good news a couple of miles round, and all have rushed to\r\ngather up provender. Some laggards are still coming in on the wing or\r\non foot.\r\n\r\nWhat is the one now trotting towards the heap, fearing to arrive too\r\nlate? His long legs work with a brusque, awkward action, as if moved by\r\nsome machine inside him; his little red antennæ spread their fans—sure\r\nsign of anxious greediness. He is coming, has arrived, not without\r\nupsetting some of the guests. It is the Sacred Beetle, all in black,\r\nthe largest and most celebrated of our dung beetles.\r\n\r\nHere he is at table, beside his fellow-guests, who are giving last\r\ntouches to their balls with the flat of their large front legs, or\r\nenriching them with a last layer before retiring to enjoy the fruit of\r\ntheir labours in peace. Let us follow this famous ball in each stage of\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\nThe edge of the beetle’s head is large and flat, and armed with six\r\nangular teeth arranged in a semicircle. It is the tool for digging and\r\ndividing, the rake to lift or reject such vegetable fibres as are not\r\nnutritious, to seek out what is best and rake it together. A choice is\r\nthus made, for these keen connoisseurs like one thing better than\r\nanother—a somewhat careless choice, indeed, if the beetle alone be\r\nconcerned, but one which is rigorously scrupulous if the maternal ball\r\nbe in question, with its central hollow where the egg will hatch. Then\r\nevery scrap of fibre is rejected, and only the quintessence of the\r\nstercorous matter is used to build the inner layer of the cell. Then,\r\nas soon as it is hatched, the young larva finds in the walls of its\r\ndwelling a dainty food which strengthens digestion and enables it later\r\nto attack the coarse outer layers. For its own needs the beetle is less\r\nfastidious, contenting itself with a general selection. The toothed\r\nhead hollows and seeks, rejects and gathers, somewhat at haphazard. The\r\nforelegs aid mightily. They are flattened, bent into the arc of a\r\ncircle, are furnished with strong nerves and armed with five stout\r\nteeth. If an effort has to be made, an obstacle overthrown, a path\r\nforced through the thickest part of the heap, the dung beetle elbows\r\nits way; in other words, throws its toothed legs right and left, and\r\nclears a half circle with a vigorous sweep of its rake. Room being\r\nmade, these same feet have a new task; they collect bundles of the\r\nmaterial raked up by the head, and pass it under the insect to the four\r\nhind-feet. These are planned for the turner’s trade. The legs,\r\nespecially the last pair, are long and slender, slightly bent in an\r\narc, and ending in a very sharp spur or talon. A glance shows that they\r\nform a spherical compass, capable of holding a globe in the bent legs\r\nto verify and correct its shape. In fact, their mission is to shape the\r\nball. Bundle after bundle the material accumulates under the insect,\r\nheld between the four legs which by a slight pressure lend it their own\r\ncurve and something of shape. Then from time to time the rough hewn\r\nball is set in motion between the legs of the double spherical compass,\r\nturned underneath the beetle, and rolled into a perfect sphere. Should\r\nthe outer layer fail in plasticity and threaten to scale off, or if\r\nsome part be too fibrous, and refuse to be shaped by rotation, the\r\nfaulty part is retouched by the forefeet; little taps of their broad\r\nsurface give consistency to the new layer and imbed the recalcitrant\r\nfibre in the general mass. When the sun shines and work is urgent, one\r\nis amazed by the feverish activity with which the turner labours. Work\r\ngoes on fast; first there was a pellet, now it is as large as a nut, by\r\nand by it will be of the size of an apple. I have seen some greedy\r\nbeetles make up a ball as large as an apple. Assuredly there is food in\r\nthe larder for some days to come!\r\n\r\nProvender being gathered, the next thing is to retire from the mêlée,\r\nand carry it to a fitting place. Now we see some of the most\r\ncharacteristic habits of the Scarabæus. He sets out at once, embracing\r\nthe ball with the long hind legs, whose talons, planted in the mass,\r\nserve as pivots—leans on the intermediary legs as pivots, and using as\r\nlevers the flat of the toothed forefeet, which press the ground\r\nalternately, journeys backward with his load, the body bent, the head\r\nlow, and the hinder part upraised. The hind feet, which are the chief\r\norgans in the mechanism, move continually, going and coming and\r\nchanging the place where the talons are stuck in, to alter the axis of\r\nrotation, to keep the load balanced and advance by an alternate push\r\nright and left. Thus the ball comes in contact with the ground in every\r\npart of it, which gives it a perfect shape and lends consistency to the\r\nouter layer by a uniform pressure. Courage! it moves, it rolls, and the\r\njourney’s end will be reached, though not without trouble. Here is a\r\nfirst difficulty. The beetle has to cross a slope, and the heavy ball\r\nwould naturally follow the incline, but for reasons best known to\r\nitself, the insect prefers to cross this natural slope—an audacious\r\nplan, which one false step or a grain of sand to upset the balance will\r\ndefeat. The false step is made, the ball rolls to the bottom of the\r\nvalley, and the insect, upset by the impetus of its load, staggers,\r\ngets again on its legs, and hastens to harness itself afresh. The\r\nmechanism works capitally. But look out, scatterbrain! follow the\r\nhollow of the valley, it will spare labour and misadventure. The road\r\nis good and quite level, and your ball will roll along with no\r\nexertion. Not a bit of it. The insect has made up its mind to remount\r\nthe slope already so fatal to it. Perhaps it suits it to return to the\r\nheights. Against that I have nothing to say, the Scarabæus knows better\r\nthan I do whether it be advisable to dwell in lofty regions. At all\r\nevents, take this path which will lead you up by a gentle incline. Not\r\nat all. If there be near at hand some very stiff slope impossible to\r\nclimb, then that slope this wrong-headed insect prefers. Then begins\r\nthe labour of Sisyphus. With endless precautions the monstrous load is\r\npainfully hoisted, step by step to a certain height, the beetle always\r\ngoing tail first. One asks one’s self by what miracle of statics such a\r\nmass can be kept on the slope. Ah! a clumsy movement brings all this\r\ntoil to naught. Down goes the ball, dragging the beetle with it. The\r\nescalade is repeated, soon followed by a fresh fall. The attempt is\r\nrenewed, and better managed at the difficult points; a nasty\r\ngrass-root, which occasioned the previous tumbles, is prudently turned;\r\nwe have almost got to the top. But gently! gently! the ascent is\r\nperilous, and a mere nothing may ruin all. A leg slips on a bit of\r\nsmooth gravel, and ball and scavenger roll down together. The beetle\r\nbegins all over again, with tireless obstinacy. Ten times, twenty\r\ntimes, will it attempt that further ascent, until persistency\r\nvanquishes all obstacles, or until, better advised, it takes the level\r\nroad.\r\n\r\nThe scavenger does not always roll his ball single-handed, but\r\nfrequently takes a partner, or rather, a partner takes him. The affair\r\nis usually managed thus: the ball being prepared, a beetle comes out of\r\nthe throng, pushing it backwards. One of the newcomers, whose own work\r\nis hardly begun, leaves its task and runs to the ball, now in motion,\r\nto lend a hand to the lucky proprietor, who appears to accept the\r\nproffered aid in an amiable spirit. The two work as partners, each\r\ndoing its best to convey the ball to a place of safety. Was a treaty\r\nmade in the workshop, a tacit agreement to share the cake? While one\r\nkneaded and shaped, was the other tapping rich veins whence to extract\r\nchoice material for their common use? I have never observed such\r\ncollaboration, but have always seen every beetle exclusively occupied\r\nby his own affairs on the field of labour, so that the last comer has\r\nno acquired rights.\r\n\r\nIs it, then, an association of the two sexes, a couple about to set up\r\nhouse? For a time I thought so. The two scavengers pushing a ball, one\r\nbefore and one behind, with equal zeal, used to remind me of certain\r\ncouplets once on a time popular on barrel-organs—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Pour monter notre ménage, hélas comment ferons-nous?\r\n    Toi devant, moi derrière, nous pousserons le tonneau.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the evidence of the scalpel forces me to give up this family idyll.\r\nThere is no outward sign of sex in the Scarabæus, but on dissecting a\r\ncouple employed on one and the same ball they often turned out to be of\r\nthe same sex. In fact, there is neither community of family nor\r\ncommunity of labour. What, then, is the reason of the apparent\r\npartnership? Merely an attempt at filching. The eager fellow-worker,\r\nunder pretence of giving a helping hand, cherishes the project of\r\ncarrying off the ball at the earliest opportunity. To make one for\r\nitself at the heap demands labour and patience; to abstract a\r\nready-made one, or at least to foist one’s self in as a sharer of the\r\nfeast, is much more convenient. If the owner’s watchfulness should\r\nslacken, one will flee with the treasure; if too closely looked after,\r\none can at least sit down at table on the pretext of services rendered.\r\nWith such tactics all turns to profit, so that pillage is carried on as\r\none of the most lucrative of trades. Some, as I have just said, play an\r\nunderhand game, hastening to the aid of some comrade who has not the\r\nleast need of them, and under the cloak of charitable assistance\r\nconceal a highly indelicate greed. Others, bolder or more confident in\r\ntheir strength, go straight to the goal and rob by main force. Every\r\nmoment some such scene as this will take place. A beetle departs alone,\r\nrolling his ball, his own property, acquired by conscientious labour;\r\nanother comes flying, whence I know not, drops heavily, folds his smoky\r\nwings under their elytra, and with the back of his toothed feet\r\noversets the proprietor, which, being hindside before, cannot defend\r\nitself. While the latter struggles to its feet the aggressor stations\r\nitself on the top of the ball, as a point of vantage whence to repel\r\nattack, folds its feet under its breast, ready for action, and awaits\r\nevents. The bereaved owner moves round the ball, seeking a favourable\r\npoint whence to attempt an assault; the thief revolves on the top of\r\nthe citadel, constantly facing him. If the former raises itself for an\r\nescalade, the latter gives it a cuff which stretches it flat on its\r\nback. Secure on the top of the fortress, the besieged would bring to\r\nnought for all time the efforts of its adversary to recover its lost\r\nproperty if the besieger did not alter his tactics. Sapping threatens\r\nto bring down both citadel and garrison. The ball being undermined,\r\nstaggers and rolls, carrying with it the robber, struggling his hardest\r\nto keep at the top, which he generally succeeds in doing, thanks to the\r\nhurried gymnastics that enable him to regain the altitude lost by the\r\nrotation of his standing place. If a false movement should bring him to\r\nthe ground, the chances become equal, and the contest turns to a\r\nwrestling match. Robber and robbed grapple body to body, breast to\r\nbreast. Their feet twist and untwist, their joints intertwine, their\r\nhorny armour clashes and grinds with the harsh sound of filed metal.\r\nThen one will succeed in throwing its adversary on the back, and,\r\nfreeing itself, hastily takes up a position on the top of the ball, and\r\nthe siege is recommenced, now by the robber, now by the robbed, as the\r\nchances of the fight may have decided. The former, no doubt a hardy\r\nbrigand and adventurer, often gets the best of it. After two or three\r\ndefeats the ex-owner wearies of the contest and returns philosophically\r\nto the heap and makes a new ball. As for the other, when all fear of a\r\nsurprise is over, he harnesses himself to the conquered ball and pushes\r\nit whither it seems good to him. I have occasionally seen a third thief\r\nrob the robber. And upon my word I was not sorry.\r\n\r\nVainly do I ask myself what Prudhon introduced into Scarabæus-morality\r\nthe audacious paradox that “Property spells theft,” or what diplomatist\r\ntaught the dung-beetle that “they may take who have the power, and they\r\nmay keep who can.” I have not the evidence required to lead me to the\r\norigin of these spoliations which have become a habit, or of this abuse\r\nof strength in order to seize a ball of dirt. All that I can affirm is\r\nthat among beetles theft is universal. These dung rollers pillage one\r\nanother with a cool effrontery really matchless. I leave it to future\r\nobservers to elucidate this curious problem in the psychology of\r\nanimals, and return to the couple rolling their balls in partnership.\r\n\r\nBut first let us dissipate an error current in books. In the\r\nmagnificent work of M. Emile Blanchard, Metamorphoses, Habits, and\r\nInstincts of Animals, I find the following passage: “Sometimes our\r\ninsect is stopped by an insurmountable obstacle: the ball has fallen\r\ninto a hole. At such a time the Ateuchus [2] displays a really\r\nastonishing grasp of the situation, and a yet more astonishing power of\r\ncommunication between individuals of the same species. Recognising the\r\nimpossibility of getting the ball over the obstacle, the Ateuchus\r\nseemingly abandons it, and flies away. If you are sufficiently endowed\r\nwith that great and noble virtue called Patience, remain near this\r\nforsaken ball. After a while the Ateuchus will return, and not alone;\r\nit will be followed by two, three, or four companions who, alighting at\r\nthe appointed spot, will join in trying to lift up the load. The\r\nAteuchus has been to seek reinforcements, and this explains why several\r\nbeetles uniting to transport a single ball is such a common sight in\r\ndry fields.” I also read in Illiger’s Entomological Magazine: “A\r\nGymnopleurus pilularius, [3] while constructing the ball of dung\r\ndestined to contain its eggs, let it roll into a hole, whence the\r\ninsect tried long and vainly to extract it. Finding this only waste of\r\ntime, he hastened to a neighbouring heap of manure to seek three of his\r\nkind, which, uniting their efforts to his, succeeded in getting out the\r\nball, and then went back to their own work.”\r\n\r\nI humbly beg pardon of my illustrious master, M. Blanchard, but\r\nassuredly things do not happen thus. First, the two accounts are so\r\nmuch alike that they must have had a common origin. After observations\r\nnot followed up closely enough to merit blind confidence, Illiger put\r\nforward the story of his Gymnopleurus, and the same fact has been\r\nattributed to the Scarabæus because it really is a common thing to find\r\ntwo of these insects busy rolling a ball, or getting it out of some\r\ndifficult position. But the partnership does not at all prove that one\r\nwent to ask help from the other in some difficulty. I have had a large\r\nmeasure of the patience recommended by M. Blanchard; I may claim to\r\nhave spent long days in the intimacy of Scarabæus sacer; I have tried\r\nevery means to comprehend its manners and customs, and to study them\r\nfrom life, and never did I see anything which suggested that one had\r\ncalled its companions to its aid. As I shall presently relate, I have\r\nput the dung-beetle to proofs far more serious than that of a ball\r\nfallen into a hole, and into far graver difficulties than having to\r\nclimb a slope—a thing which is mere sport for the obstinate Sisyphus,\r\nwho seems to enjoy the rough gymnastics required by steep places, as if\r\nthe ball grew thereby firmer, and therefore more valuable. I have\r\ninvented situations where the insect had extreme need of help, and\r\nnever could I detect any proof of good offices between comrades. I have\r\nseen pillaged and pillagers, and nothing else. If a number of beetles\r\nsurrounded the same ball, it meant battle. My humble opinion is that\r\nseveral Scarabæi gathered round a pellet with intent to thieve was what\r\ngave rise to these stories of comrades called in to give a helping\r\nhand. Incomplete observations have turned an audacious robber into a\r\nserviceable companion who put his own work aside to do a friendly turn.\r\nIt is no slight thing to admit that an insect has a truly surprising\r\ngrasp of the situation and a facility of communication between\r\nindividuals more surprising still; therefore I insist on this point,\r\nAre we to suppose that a Scarabæus in distress conceives the idea of\r\nbegging for help?—flies off, explores the country round to find\r\ncomrades at work on a dropping, and having found them, by some\r\npantomime, especially by movements of the antennæ, addresses them more\r\nor less thus: “Hullo, you there! My load is upset in a hole yonder;\r\ncome and help me to get it out. I will do as much for you another\r\ntime.” And are we to suppose too that his colleagues understand him?\r\nAnd, more wonderful still, that they leave their work, their ball newly\r\nbegun, their beloved ball, exposed to the greed of others, and certain\r\nto be filched during their absence, in order to help the supplicant! I\r\nam profoundly incredulous of so much self-sacrifice, and my incredulity\r\nis borne out by all which I have seen during many long years, not in\r\ncollection boxes, but on the spots where the Scarabæi work. Outside of\r\nthe cares of maternity—cares in which it almost always shows itself\r\nadmirable, the Insect—unless, indeed, it lives in society like bees and\r\nants and some others—thinks and cares for nothing but itself.\r\n\r\nLet us drop this discussion, excused by the importance of the subject.\r\nI have already said that a Scarabæus, owner of a ball which it is\r\npushing backwards, is often joined by another which hastens to its aid\r\nwith interested views, ready to rob if it gets the chance. Let us call\r\nthe pair associates, though that is hardly the name for them, since one\r\nforces itself on the other, who perhaps only accepts help for fear of\r\nworse. The meeting is, however, perfectly peaceable. The arrival of the\r\nassistant does not distract the proprietor for an instant from his\r\nlabours; the newcomer seems animated by the best intentions, and\r\ninstantly sets to work. The way they harness themselves is different\r\nfor each. The owner of the ball occupies the chief position, the place\r\nof honour; he pushes behind the load, his hind feet upraised, his head\r\ndownward. The helper is in front, in a reverse position, head raised,\r\ntoothed arms on the ball, long hind legs on the ground. Between the two\r\nmoves the ball, pushed before it by the one, dragged towards it by the\r\nother. The efforts of the couple are not always harmonious, especially\r\nas the assistant turns his back to the road to be traversed, and the\r\nview of the owner is bounded by his load. Hence repeated accidents and\r\nludicrous tumbles, taken cheerfully, each hastening to pick himself up\r\nand resume his former position. On level ground this style of draught\r\ndoes not answer to the expenditure of energy, for want of precision in\r\ncombined movements; the Scarabæus behind would do as well or better\r\nalone, and the assistant, having proved his goodwill at the risk of\r\ndisturbing the mechanism, decides to keep quiet of course without\r\nabandoning the precious globe, which he looks on as already his. A ball\r\ntouched is a ball acquired. He will not be so imprudent as to let go;\r\nthe other would instantly take advantage of it. So he folds his legs\r\nunder him, flattens himself, incrusts himself, as it were, on the ball,\r\nand becomes part of it. Ball and beetle roll together, pushed along by\r\nthe lawful owner. Whether it should go over the body of the other,\r\nwhether he be above, below, or on one side of the rolling load, matters\r\nnot—the intruder lies low. A singular helper this, who lets himself be\r\nrun over for the sake of a share in the provender! But let them come to\r\na steep incline, and he gets a chance of displaying his usefulness. On\r\nthe steep slope he takes the lead, holding up the heavy load with his\r\ntoothed feet while his comrade steadies himself to hoist the load a\r\nlittle higher. Thus, by a combination of judicious efforts, I have seen\r\nthem mount ascents, the one above holding up, the lower one pushing,\r\nwhere all the obstinate efforts of a single beetle must have failed.\r\nAll, however, have not the same zeal in difficult moments; some, just\r\nwhen their assistance is most wanted on a slope, do not appear in the\r\nleast aware that there is anything to overcome. While the unhappy\r\nSisyphus is exhausting himself in efforts to surmount his difficulties,\r\nthe other remains passive, incrusted on the ball, rolling down with it,\r\nand forthwith hoisted up again.\r\n\r\nI have often tried the following experiment on two associates in order\r\nto judge of their inventive faculties in a serious predicament. Let us\r\nsuppose them on level ground, the assistant firmly seated on the ball,\r\nthe other pushing. Without disturbing the latter, I nail the ball to\r\nthe ground with a long, strong pin; it comes to a sudden stop. The\r\nbeetle, unaware of my treachery, doubtless believes in some rut, some\r\ndandelion root or pebble stopping the way. He redoubles his efforts,\r\nstruggles his hardest, but nothing moves. What has happened? Let us go\r\nand see. Twice or thrice he walks round his pellet. Discovering nothing\r\nwhich can explain its immovableness, he goes behind and pushes again.\r\nThe ball remains motionless. Let us look above. He climbs up to find\r\nnothing but his motionless colleague, for I have taken care to drive\r\nthe head of the pin in deep enough to hide the head in the mass of the\r\nball. He examines the summit and again descends; fresh thrusts are\r\nvigorously applied in front and on either side with the same want of\r\nsuccess. Certainly no scavenger beetle ever yet found himself\r\nconfronted by such a problem of inertia. It is the very moment for\r\nclaiming assistance, a thing all the more easy that the colleague is\r\nclose at hand, squatted on the top of the dome. Will the Scarabæus give\r\nhim a shake, or address him somewhat thus: What are you about, lazy\r\nbones? Come and look here; something has broken down. Nothing proves\r\nthat he does so, for the beetle long persists in trying to move the\r\nimmovable, examining now on this side, now on that, now above, now\r\nbelow, while his friend still remains quiescent. In the end, however,\r\nthe latter becomes aware that something unusual is going on; it is\r\nbrought home to him by the uneasy comings and goings of his companion\r\nand by the immobility of the ball, so in his turn he comes down to look\r\ninto the matter. Double harness does not prove more effectual than\r\nsingle, and matters grow complicated. The little fans of their antennæ\r\nopen and shut, open again, quiver and betray their lively anxiety. Then\r\na stroke of genius ends their perplexities. Who knows what may be\r\nunderneath? They explore below the ball, and a slight excavation\r\nreveals the pin. They recognise at once that the crux is there. Had I a\r\nvoice in the matter I should have said, “An excavation must be made,\r\nand the stake which holds the ball must be got out.” This very\r\nelementary proceeding, and one so easy to such expert excavators, was\r\nnot adopted nor even attempted. The scavenger beetle was cleverer than\r\nthe man. The two colleagues, one on this side, one on that, insinuated\r\nthemselves under the ball, which slipped up along the pin in proportion\r\nas the living wedges raised it, the softness of the material allowing\r\nof this clever manœuvre. Soon the ball was suspended at a height equal\r\nto that of the beetles’ bodies. What remained to do was more difficult.\r\nFrom lying flat they gradually got on their legs and pushed upward with\r\ntheir backs. It was hard to accomplish, the feet losing strength the\r\nmore they stretched upward, but they did it. Then came a moment when\r\nthey could no longer use their backs to push, the highest point\r\npossible being reached. There was a last resource, but one much less\r\nfavourable to the development of strength. Now in one of the postures\r\nin which it drags a ball, now in the other,—that is to say, either head\r\ndownward or the reverse,—the insect pushes with hind or fore feet.\r\nFinally, unless the pin be too long, the ball drops to the ground. The\r\nperforation is repaired as best it can be, and the ball is at once\r\ndragged onward.\r\n\r\nBut if the pin should be too long, the ball remains suspended at a\r\nheight which the insect cannot increase by rearing itself up. In this\r\ncase, after vain evolutions around the inaccessible maypole, the\r\nbeetles give up the struggle, unless you are kind-hearted enough to\r\ncomplete the work yourself, and restore their treasure, or unless you\r\naid them by raising the floor with a little flat stone, a pedestal from\r\nwhence the insect can continue its work. Its use does not seem to be\r\nimmediately understood, for neither beetle shows any readiness to\r\nprofit by it. However, by chance or otherwise, one gets on the stone.\r\nOh, joy! as it passed it felt the ball touch its back. Thereupon\r\ncourage returns, and the struggle begins again. Standing on its\r\nplatform the beetle stretches its joints, rounds its back, and hoists\r\nthe pellet. When that no longer avails, it manœuvres with its feet, now\r\nupright, now head downward. There is a new pause and new signs of\r\nuneasiness when the limit of extension is reached. Without disturbing\r\nthe creature let us put another little stone on the first. By the help\r\nof the new step, which gives a support for its levers, the insect\r\npursues its task. Adding one step to another as required, I have seen\r\nthe Scarabæus, perched on a shaky pile of three or four fingers’\r\nbreadth, persisting in its labour until the ball was completely freed.\r\n\r\nHad it some vague consciousness of the services rendered by the\r\nelevation of its point of leverage? I cannot believe it, although the\r\nbeetle profited very cleverly by my platform of little stones, for if\r\nthe very elementary idea of using a higher base to reach something too\r\nelevated was not beyond it, how was it that neither beetle bethought\r\nhim of offering his back to the other, thus rendering the task\r\npossible? One assisting the other, they might have doubled the height\r\nattained. They are far indeed from any such combinations. Here, each\r\npushes the ball with all its might, but pushes as if alone, without\r\nseeming to suspect the happy result which would be brought about by a\r\ncombined effort. When the ball is fastened to the ground by a pin, they\r\nbehave as they would when the ball is stopped by a loop of dandelion,\r\nor held by some slender bit of stalk which has got into the soft,\r\nrolling mass. My artifice brought about a stoppage not unlike those\r\nwhich occur when the ball is rolling amid the many inequalities of the\r\nground, and the insect acts as it would have acted in some\r\ncircumstances where I had not interfered. It uses its back as a wedge\r\nand lever and pushes with its feet without at all varying its means of\r\naction, even when it might call a comrade to its help.\r\n\r\nIf it has to face the difficulties of a ball nailed to the ground with\r\nno assistant, its dynamic manœuvres are exactly the same, and it\r\nsucceeds, so long as we give the indispensable help of a platform\r\ngradually built up. Should this help be refused, the Scarabæus, no\r\nlonger stimulated by the touch of its beloved ball, loses hope, and\r\nsooner or later, no doubt with bitter regret, flies off, whither I know\r\nnot. What I do know is, that it does not return with a squadron of\r\ncompanions whom it has implored to help it. What could it do with them,\r\nsince it cannot utilise even the single comrade when one shares the\r\nball? Perhaps, however, an experiment which suspends the pellet at a\r\nheight inaccessible to the insect when its means of action are\r\nexhausted may be too much outside of ordinary conditions. Let us try a\r\nminiature ditch, deep enough and steep enough to prevent a beetle when\r\nplaced at the bottom with its load from rolling it up. These are the\r\nexact conditions named by Blanchard and Illiger. What happens? When\r\npersistent yet fruitless efforts show the beetle that it can do\r\nnothing, it spreads its wings and flies off. Long, very long have I\r\nwaited, on the faith of what these learned men say, expecting it to\r\nreturn with its friends, but I have always waited in vain. Often, too,\r\nmany days later I have found the ball just where I tried the\r\nexperiment, either at the top of the pin or at the bottom of the hole,\r\nproving that nothing fresh had happened. A pellet abandoned from\r\nnecessity is abandoned for good and all, without salvage by the help of\r\nother beetles. Dexterous use of wedge and lever to move the arrested\r\nball is the highest intellectual effort I have ever seen in the\r\nScarabæus sacer. As a counterpoise to what experiment refutes, namely,\r\nan appeal for help to brother beetles, I very willingly chronicle this\r\nfeat of mechanics for the glorification of the Scarabæus. Straying over\r\nsandy plains thickset with thyme, ruts, and slopes, the ball is rolled\r\nfor a while by the two partners, the material thus acquiring a firmness\r\nwhich they probably find palatable. By and by a favourable spot is\r\nselected. The proprietor, who has always kept the place of honour\r\nbehind the ball and is the one who performs almost the whole work of\r\ndraught, begins to hollow out the dining-room. Beside him is the ball,\r\nto which his associate clings, motionless. Head and toothed legs attack\r\nthe sand, flinging quantities backward, and the excavation advances\r\nrapidly. Soon the insect disappears therein. Each time that he brings a\r\nload to upper air he never fails to glance at the ball to make sure\r\nthat all is going on well. Now and again he brings it nearer to the\r\nedge of the cavity, feels it, and seems to gain new zeal from its\r\ncontact. The other beetle, hypocrite that he is, continues to inspire\r\nconfidence by his motionless attitude on the ball. Meanwhile, the\r\nunderground hall grows larger and deeper, and the excavator appears\r\nmore rarely, hindered by the extent of his labours. The moment is\r\nfavourable, the sleeper rouses up. The crafty partner decamps with the\r\nball, dragging it behind him with the haste of a thief fearing to be\r\ncaught in the act. This abuse of trust rouses my ire, but I let it pass\r\nin the interest of the story—time enough to interfere on behalf of\r\nmorality if the upshot threaten to turn out ill.\r\n\r\nAlready the thief is some yards away. The robbed beetle comes up from\r\nhis hole, looks, and finds nothing. No doubt he has himself had a hand\r\nin like proceedings. Scent and sight soon put him on the track and he\r\nhurriedly comes up with the robber, whereupon this sly dog promptly\r\nchanges his position, gets on his hind legs and clasps the ball with\r\nhis toothed arms as he does when acting helper. Ah, you rascal! I see\r\nthrough you! you would excuse yourself by declaring that the ball\r\nrolled down the slope, and that you are trying to stop it and take it\r\nhome. I, however, who am an impartial witness, assert that the ball,\r\nbeing well balanced at the mouth of the hole, did not move of its own\r\naccord. Besides, the ground is level. I affirm that I saw you set it in\r\nmotion and make off with unequivocal intentions. It was an attempt at\r\nlarceny or I know nothing about it. My evidence not being taken into\r\nconsideration, the owner listens mildly to his companion’s excuses, and\r\nthe two roll the ball back as if nothing had happened.\r\n\r\nBut if the thief can get far enough away, or can conceal his track by\r\nadroitly doubling back, the loss is irreparable. To have collected\r\nprovisions under a fiery sun, to have conveyed them a weary way, to\r\nhave hollowed out a comfortable banqueting hall in the sand, and then,\r\njust when all is ready, and appetite whetted by toil lends charms to\r\nthe prospect of the approaching feast, to find one’s self suddenly\r\nrobbed by a companion is certainly a reverse of fortune that would try\r\nmost people’s courage. But the dung beetle does not allow itself to be\r\ncast down by this malicious blow of fate; it rubs its cheeks, spreads\r\nits antennæ, sniffs the air, and flies to the nearest heap to begin\r\nagain. This is a trait of character which I admire and envy.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose the Scarabæus lucky enough to have met with a reliable\r\npartner, or, better still, that he has no self-invited associate. The\r\nhole is ready, made in friable earth, usually in sand, rather shallow,\r\nabout the size of one’s fist, communicating with the outer air by a\r\nshort passage, just wide enough to let the ball pass. As soon as the\r\nprovender is introduced, the Scarabæus shuts itself in, stopping up the\r\nmouth of the passage with fragments kept in reserve in a corner. Once\r\nthe door is closed, nothing outside betrays the banqueting hall. And\r\nnow hurrah! all is for the best, in the best of all possible worlds.\r\nThe table is sumptuously laid, the ceiling tempers the heat of the sun,\r\nonly allowing a gentle moist heat to penetrate; the calm, the darkness,\r\nthe concert given by the field-cricket overhead, all favour digestion.\r\nCarried away by my interest, I have caught myself listening at the\r\ndoor, believing that I heard sung at table the famous\r\n\r\n\r\n        Ah! how sweet ’tis nought to do\r\n        When all around is endless stir.\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom the opera of Galathea.\r\n\r\nWho would dare disturb the beatitude of such a banquet? Alas! the\r\ndesire for knowledge makes one capable of anything, and I have not\r\nshrunk from even this. I now give the result of thus violating the\r\nsanctity of home-life. The ball filled almost the whole space, the\r\nmagnificent store of victuals rising from floor to ceiling, a narrow\r\npassage separated it from the walls. In this sat the banqueters, two at\r\nmost, often but one, their faces to the table, their backs to the wall.\r\nWhen once they have taken their places nobody stirs, all their vital\r\npowers are absorbed by the digestive faculties. No little movement\r\nwhich might cause the loss of a mouthful, no daintiness which might\r\nwaste the food—everything must be done decently and in order. To see\r\nthem thus absorbed round a lump of dung, one would say that they were\r\naware of their rôle as earth-cleansers, and consciously devoted\r\nthemselves to that marvellous chemistry which out of impurity brings\r\nthe flower that gladdens the eye, and the wing-cases of the Scarabæus\r\nwhich adorn the turf in springtime. To fit it for this all-important\r\nwork, which turns into living matter the residue that horse and sheep\r\ncannot utilise, in spite of the perfection of their digestive organs,\r\nthe dung beetle needs special tools. Accordingly anatomy shows the\r\nimmense length of its intestine, which, folded repeatedly on itself,\r\nslowly deals with the material in its manifold circuits, and exhausts\r\nthe very last atom capable of being used. Where the stomach of the\r\nherbivorous animal can extract nothing, this powerful alembic draws\r\nriches which under its influence become the ebony mail of the Scarabæus\r\nsacer, and a cuirass of gold and rubies for other species. Sanitary\r\nprinciples require that this marvellous change be made as rapidly as\r\npossible; therefore the Scarabæus is endowed with a matchless power of\r\ndigestion. Once shut up with food, it never ceases to eat and digest\r\nuntil the whole store is devoured. Proof of this is easily come by.\r\nOpen the cell where it has retired from the world at any hour and you\r\nfind the insect eating, and behind it, still attached to the creature,\r\nis a continuous cord, rolled carelessly like a bundle of cables.\r\nWithout going into particulars, we can guess what this cord represents.\r\nMouthful by mouthful the great ball passes into the digestive organs,\r\nyielding up its nutritive principle, and reappearing spun into a rope.\r\nNow this unbroken cord, often without a joint and always hanging from\r\nthe orifice, proves, with absolute certainty, how continuous is the\r\naction of digestion. By the time that the food is nearly eaten, the\r\nrope is astonishingly long. Where else could one find another stomach,\r\nthat, to avoid any loss in the debit and credit ledger of life, can\r\nfeast for a week or a fortnight on such miserable cheer? When the whole\r\nmass has been digested, the hermit returns to daylight, seeks, finds,\r\nand shapes a new ball, and begins all over again. This royal life lasts\r\none or two months, from June to July; then, with the coming of the\r\nfierce heat, which the grasshoppers love, the Scarabæi take up summer\r\nquarters and bury themselves in the cool earth. With the first rains\r\nthey reappear, less numerous and less active than in spring, but\r\napparently taken up by the all-important task of continuing their race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE ENCLOSURE\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you seek among writers for information as to the habits of Scarabæus\r\nsacer in particular, and on the dung robbers in general, you find that\r\nscience has not got beyond some of the beliefs current in the time of\r\nthe Pharaohs. We are told that the ball which is dragged along contains\r\nan egg, and is a cradle where the larva will find board and lodging.\r\nThe parents roll it over rough ground to make it round, and when shocks\r\nand shakes and tumbles all along the slopes have shaped it properly,\r\nthey bury it and abandon it to mother earth.\r\n\r\nSo rough a start in life always seemed to me unlikely. How could a\r\nbeetle’s egg, so tender and fragile as it is, endure the rocking of its\r\nrolling cradle? There exists in the germ a spark of life which the\r\nslightest touch, the merest trifle, can extinguish, and is it likely\r\nthat the parents should take it into their heads to lug it about over\r\nhill and dale for hours? Not they; maternal tenderness does not subject\r\nits progeny to the martyrdom of Regulus.\r\n\r\nHowever, something more than logical reasoning was required to sweep\r\naway received opinions. I therefore opened hundreds of balls rolled by\r\nthe dung beetles and others out of holes dug under my eyes, and never,\r\nnever did I find either a central niche or an egg in the pellets. They\r\nare invariably rough heaps of food, hastily shaped, with no particular\r\nstructure inside them, merely provender with which the beetles shut\r\nthemselves up to enjoy an orgy in peace for some days. They covet and\r\nsteal them with an energy which they certainly would not show if it\r\nimplied new family cares. It would be absurd for one Scarabæus to steal\r\nthe eggs of another, each having enough to do in securing the future of\r\nits own. So on that point no more doubt can exist; the balls rolled by\r\nbeetles never contain eggs.\r\n\r\nMy first attempt to resolve the thorny question as to the bringing up\r\nof the larva was by constructing an ample enclosure with an artificial\r\nsoil of sand and soil constantly renewed. Some twenty Scarabæus sacer\r\nwere introduced, together with Copris, Gymnopleurus, and Onthophagus,\r\nand never did entomological experiment cost me so many mortifications.\r\nThe main difficulty was to renew the food. My landlord owned a stable\r\nand a horse. I gained the confidence of his servant, who first laughed\r\nat my plans, and then allowed himself to be gained over by a silver\r\ncoin. Every breakfast for my beetles cost twopence halfpenny; never\r\nbefore did the budget of a scavenger beetle amount to such a sum, I can\r\nstill see and shall always see Joseph, as, when after grooming his\r\nhorse of a morning, he would raise his head a little above the wall\r\nbetween the two gardens and call “Heigh! heigh!” on which I would hurry\r\nto receive a pot of manure. Discretion on both sides was necessary, as\r\nwill be seen. One day his master appeared at the moment of transfer,\r\nand made up his mind that all his manure went over the wall, and that\r\nwhat he wanted for his cabbages went to grow my verbenas and narcissus.\r\nVainly did I try to explain; my explanations seemed to him mere jests.\r\nJoseph got a sound scolding, was called this and that, and threatened\r\nwith dismissal if it happened again. It did not.\r\n\r\nI still had the resource of going bashfully along the road with a twist\r\nof paper to gather up stealthily provisions for my pupils. I did so,\r\nand do not blush for it. Sometimes fate was kind. A donkey carrying the\r\nproduce of the market-gardens of Château-Renard and Barbentane to\r\nAvignon would depose an offering as he passed my door. Such a gift,\r\ninstantly collected, enriched me for several days. In short, by hook or\r\nby crook, by watching for a dropping, or turning diplomatist to get\r\none, I succeeded in feeding my captives. If success is earned by an\r\nexperiment conducted with a fervour that nothing can discourage, my\r\nexperiment deserved to prosper. It did not. After some time my\r\nScarabæi, consumed by home-sickness in a space which deprived them of\r\ntheir wider movements, let themselves die miserably without revealing\r\ntheir secret. Gymnopleurus and Onthophagus responded better to my\r\nexpectations. In due time I shall use the information furnished by\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAlong with my attempts at education in an enclosed space, I carried on\r\ndirect researches, the results of which were far from what I desired. I\r\nfelt that I must have assistants. Just then a joyous band of children\r\nwere crossing the high land. It was a Thursday, and oblivious of school\r\nand hated lessons, an apple in one hand and a piece of bread in the\r\nother, they were coming from the neighbouring village of Les Angles and\r\nwending their way to search on the bare hill where the bullets drop\r\nwhen the garrison is shooting at a mark. A few bits of lead, worth\r\nabout a halfpenny, were the object of this early morning expedition.\r\n\r\nThe tiny rosy flowers of wild geranium enamelled the turf which for a\r\nbrief moment beautified this Arabia Petrea; the water wagtail, half\r\nblack, half white, uttered its scornful cry as it fluttered from one\r\npoint of rock to another; on the threshold of burrows, dug at the foot\r\nof tufts of thyme, the field-crickets filled the air with their\r\nmonotonous symphony. And the children were happy in this festival of\r\nspring—happier still at their prospective riches—that halfpenny which\r\nthey would get in return for the bullets they would find, that\r\nhalfpenny which would enable them next Sunday to buy at the stall set\r\nup before the church two peppermint bull’s-eyes—two great bull’s-eyes\r\nat a farthing apiece!\r\n\r\nI accosted the tallest, whose wide-awake air gave me hopes of him; the\r\nlittle ones formed a circle, each munching his apple; I explained the\r\nmatter and showed them Scarabæus sacer rolling his ball, and told them\r\nthat in a like ball, buried somewhere, I knew not where, a hollow is\r\nsometimes found, and in this hollow a grub. The thing to be done was to\r\nsearch about and watch the beetles in order to find such a ball. Those\r\nwith no maggot would not count. To stimulate the children by a fabulous\r\nsum which would henceforward secure to me the time hitherto devoted to\r\nsome farthing’s worth of lead, I promised a franc, a lovely new coin\r\nworth twenty halfpennies, for each inhabited ball. At the mention of\r\nthis sum eyes opened wide with delightful naïveté. I had quite upset\r\ntheir ideas on the subject of money by naming this exorbitant price as\r\nthe value of a piece of dirt. Then, to show I was in good earnest, I\r\ndistributed some halfpence to clinch the bargain. The following week at\r\nthe same day and hour I was to appear at the same place and faithfully\r\nperform the conditions of our compact towards all who should have made\r\nthe precious discovery. Having thoroughly posted up all the party, I\r\ndismissed the children. “He really means it!” they said as they went\r\naway; “he really means it! If we could only get one apiece!” and with\r\nhearts swelling with sweet hope, they clinked their pence in the hollow\r\nof the hand. The flattened bullets were forgotten. I saw the children\r\nscatter over the plain and hunt about.\r\n\r\nOn the appointed day the week after I returned to the tableland\r\nconfident of success. My young helpers would no doubt have mentioned\r\nthis lucrative trade in beetle-balls to their comrades and shown their\r\nhandsels to convince the incredulous. Accordingly I found a larger\r\nparty assembled than the first time. On seeing me they ran up, but\r\nthere was no eagerness, no shout of joy. I saw that things had gone\r\nill. Many times on coming out of school had they sought for what I had\r\ndescribed, but in vain. Some balls, found underground with the\r\nScarabæus, were brought, but they were mere heaps of food, and there\r\nwas no grub. Fresh explanations were given and a new appointment was\r\nmade for the following Thursday. Again the same want of success. The\r\nseekers, discouraged, were now few. I made a last appeal, but nothing\r\ncame of it. Finally, I paid the most zealous, those who had been\r\nfaithful to the last, and we dissolved partnership. I could count on no\r\none but myself for researches, which seemed simple enough, but really\r\nwere exceedingly difficult. Even up to the present time, after many\r\nyears, excavations made in favourable spots and hopeful opportunities\r\nhave not yet given any clear, consistent result. I am reduced to\r\ncombining incomplete observations and to filling up gaps by analogy.\r\n[4] The little which I have seen, together with observations on other\r\ndung beetles—Gymnopleurus, Copris, and Onthophagus—in my enclosure is\r\nsummed up in the following statement.\r\n\r\nThe ball destined for the egg is not fashioned in public, in the\r\nhurry-scurry of the general workshop. It is a work of art and much\r\npatience, demanding minute care impossible amid a crowd. One must\r\nretire to meditate one’s plans and set to work, so the mother makes a\r\nhollow from four to eight inches deep in the sand. It is a rather\r\nspacious hall, communicating with the outside by a much narrower\r\ngallery. The insect carries down choice materials, no doubt first\r\nrolled into pellets. She must make many journeys, for the contents of\r\nthe hole are out of all proportion with the door, and could not be\r\ncarried in at once. I recollect a Spanish Copris which, at the moment I\r\ncame upon it, was finishing a ball as large as an orange at the bottom\r\nof a burrow only communicating with the outside world by means of a\r\ngallery where I could but just insert my finger. It is true that the\r\nCopris do not roll balls or make long journeys to fetch food. They dig\r\na hole immediately under the dung, and crawl backward with successive\r\nloads to the bottom of their cavity. The facility for provisioning and\r\nthe security offered by working under the manure favour a taste for\r\nluxury not to be expected in the same degree among beetles belonging to\r\nthe rude trade of ball-rollers; but should it return two or three\r\ntimes, Scarabæus sacer can amass wealth of which Copris hispanica might\r\nwell be jealous.\r\n\r\nSo far the insect has only raw material, put together anyhow. The first\r\nthing to do is to select very carefully, taking what is most delicate\r\nfor the inner layers, upon which the larva will feed, and the coarser\r\nfor the outer ones which merely serve as a protecting shell. Then\r\naround a central hollow which receives the egg the materials must be\r\narranged layer after layer, according to their decreasing fineness and\r\nnutritive value; the strata must be made consistent and adhere one to\r\nanother; and finally, the bits of fibre in the outside crust, which has\r\nto protect the whole thing, must be felted together. How can the\r\nScarabæus, clumsy and stiff as it seems, accomplish such a work in\r\ncomplete darkness, at the bottom of a hole so full of provisions that\r\nthere is barely room to move? When I think how delicate is the work\r\ndone and how rude the tools of the workman,—of the angular feet fitted\r\nto hollow the ground, and, if need be, even tufa,—I am reminded of an\r\nelephant trying to make lace. Explain who can this miracle of maternal\r\nindustry; I give it up, especially as it has not been my good fortune\r\nto see the artist at work. Let us restrict ourselves to describing this\r\nmasterpiece.\r\n\r\nThe ball which contains the egg is generally as large as a middle-sized\r\napple. In the midst is an oval cavity about a centimetre in diameter.\r\nAt the bottom is the egg, fixed vertically; it is cylindrical, rounded\r\nat each end, yellowish-white, about as large as a grain of wheat, but\r\nshorter. The wall of the hollow is washed over with a greenish-brown,\r\nsemi-fluid matter, manure cream, destined as the first food of the\r\nlarva. Does the mother collect the quintessence of the dung to make\r\nthis delicate food? The look of it tells me that it is a pap prepared\r\nin the maternal stomach. The pigeon softens grain in its crop, and\r\nturns it into a kind of milk food which it disgorges for its nestlings.\r\nIt would seem that the beetle shows the same tender care. It half\r\ndigests the choice food, and disgorges it in the shape of a delicate\r\nfilm to line the walls of the cavity where the egg is laid. Thus, when\r\nfirst hatched, the larva finds food easy of digestion, which rapidly\r\nstrengthens its stomach and allows it to attack the under layers which\r\nlack the same refinement of preparation. Under the semi-fluid paste is\r\na choice pulp, compact and homogeneous, whence every particle of fibre\r\nis banished. Beyond are the coarser strata where vegetable fibres\r\nabound, and finally the outside of the ball is composed of the coarsest\r\nmaterials felted together into a resistant shell. Manifestly there is a\r\nprogressive change of diet. On issuing from the egg the feeble grub\r\nlicks the fine paste on the walls of its dwelling. There is but little\r\nof it, still it is strengthening and of high nutritious value. To the\r\nbottle of early infancy succeeds the pap of the weanling, intermediate\r\nbetween the dainty fare of the start and the coarse nourishment at the\r\nend. This layer is thick enough and abundant enough to make the maggot\r\ninto a robust grub. Then, strong food for the strong, barley bread with\r\nits husks, raw dung full of sharp bits of hay. The larva is\r\nsuperabundantly provisioned with it, and, having attained its growth,\r\ncomes to the imprisoning outer layer. The capacity of the dwelling has\r\nincreased with that of its inhabitant. The small original cavity with\r\nits excessively thick walls is now a large cell with sides only a few\r\nlines thick. The inner layers have turned into larva, nymph, or\r\nScarabæus, as the case may be. In short, the ball is now a shell,\r\nhiding within its spacious interior the mysteries of metamorphosis.\r\n\r\nMy observations go no further; my certificates of the birth and\r\ncondition of the Scarabæus do not go beyond the egg; I have not\r\nactually seen the larva which, however, is known and described by\r\nvarious authors. Neither have I seen the perfect insect while yet\r\nenclosed in the cell, previous to exercising its functions as\r\nball-roller and excavator, and that is exactly what I should most have\r\ndesired to see. I should have liked to find the creature in its\r\nbirthplace, recently transformed, new to all labour, so that I might\r\nhave examined the worker’s hand before it set to its tasks, and for the\r\nfollowing reason.\r\n\r\nInsects have each foot terminated by a kind of finger or tarsus,\r\ncomposed of a series of delicate portions which may be compared to the\r\njoints of our fingers. They end in a crooked nail. One claw to each\r\nfoot is the rule, and this claw, at least in the case of the superior\r\nColeoptera, especially the scavenger beetles, contains five joints. Now\r\nby a strange exception, the Scarabæus has no tarsi on its forefeet,\r\nwhile possessing well-shaped ones with five joints on the two other\r\npairs. They are imperfect, maimed, wanting in their front limbs in that\r\nwhich represents, roughly indeed, our hand in an insect. A like anomaly\r\nis found in the Onitis and Bubas, also of the scavenger family.\r\nEntomology has long noted this curious fact without being able to give\r\na satisfactory explanation. Is it a birth imperfection? Does the beetle\r\ncome into the world without fingers on its front limbs, or does it lose\r\nthem as soon as it enters on its toilsome labours?\r\n\r\nOne might easily suppose such mutilation a consequence of the insect’s\r\nhard work. To grope, to excavate, to rake, to divide now among the\r\ngravel in the soil, now in the fibrous mass of manure, is not a work in\r\nwhich organs so delicate as the tarsi can be used without danger. Yet\r\ngraver is it that when the insect is rolling its ball backward, head\r\ndownward, it is with the end of the forefeet that it grips the ground.\r\nWhat becomes of the weak feet, no thicker than a thread, in this\r\nperpetual contact with all the inequalities of the soil? They are\r\nuseless—merely in the way, and sooner or later they are bound to\r\ndisappear, crushed, torn off, worn out. Our workmen, alas! are too\r\noften maimed by handling heavy tools, and lifting great weights, and\r\nthe same may be the case with the Scarabæus which rolls a ball that to\r\nit is a huge load. In that case the maimed arms would be a noble\r\ncertificate of a life of toil.\r\n\r\nBut serious doubts at once suggest themselves. If these mutilations be\r\naccidental, and the result of laborious work, they should be the\r\nexception, not the rule. Because a workman or several workmen have had\r\na hand crushed in machinery, it does not follow that all others should\r\nbe maimed. If the Scarabæus often, or even very often, loses the\r\nfore-claws in its trade of ball-roller, there must be some which,\r\ncleverer or more fortunate, have preserved their tarsi. Let us then\r\nconsult facts. I have observed a very large number of the species of\r\nScarabæus which inhabit France, the S. sacer, common in Provence; S.\r\nsemipunctatus, which is seldom found far from the sea, and frequents\r\nthe sandy shores of Cette, Palavas, and of the Gulf of Juan; also S.\r\nlongicollis, which is much more widely spread than the two others, and\r\nfound at least as far up the Rhône Valley as Lyons. Finally, I have\r\nobserved an African kind, S. cicatricosus, found in the environs of\r\nConstantine, and the want of tarsi on the forefeet has proved\r\ninvariable in all four species, at all events as far as my observations\r\ngo. Therefore the Scarabæus is maimed from birth, and it must be no\r\naccident but a natural peculiarity.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we have further proof in another reason. Were the absence of\r\nfore-claws accidental, and the consequence of rough labour, there are\r\nother insects, especially among the scavenger beetles, which undertake\r\nexcavations yet more difficult than those of the Scarabæus, and which\r\nought therefore to be still more liable to lose their front claws, as\r\nthese are useless and in the way when the foot has to serve as a strong\r\ntool for excavation. For instance, the Geotrupes, who deserve their\r\nname of Earth-piercer so well, make hollows in the hard and beaten soil\r\nof paths among pebbles cemented by clay—vertical pits so deep that to\r\nreach the lowest cell one has to use powerful digging tools, and even\r\nthen one does not always succeed. Now these miners par excellence, who\r\neasily open long galleries in surroundings whose surface the Scarabæus\r\nsacer could hardly disturb, have their front tarsi intact, as if to\r\nperforate tufa were a work calling for delicacy rather than strength.\r\nEverything then points to the belief that, if observed in its natal\r\ncell, the baby Scarabæus would be found mutilated like the veteran who\r\nhas travelled the world and grown worn with labour.\r\n\r\nOn this absence of fingers might be based an argument in favour of the\r\ntheories now in fashion—the struggle for life and the evolution of the\r\nspecies. One might say that the Scarabæus had originally tarsi on all\r\nits feet in conformity with the general laws of insect organisation.\r\nOne way or another, some have lost these embarrassing appendages on\r\ntheir forefeet, they being hurtful rather than useful. Finding\r\nthemselves the better for this mutilation, which proved favourable to\r\ntheir work, little by little they gained a superiority over the less\r\nfavoured ones, founded a race by transmitting their fingerless stumps\r\nto their descendants, and finally, the primitively fingered insect\r\nbecame the fingerless Scarabæus of our time. I am willing to agree to\r\nthis reasoning if it could first be demonstrated why, with like\r\nlabours,—labours even far harder,—the Geotrupes has preserved his\r\ntarsi. Meantime let us continue to believe that the first Scarabæus who\r\nrolled a ball, perhaps on the shores of some lake where bathed the\r\nPalæotherium, was as much without tarsi as him of our own day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nCERCERIS BUPRESTICIDA\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery one has met with books which, according to his turn of mind, have\r\nbeen epoch-making, opening to him horizons whose very existence he had\r\nnever guessed. They throw wide open the gates of a new world where\r\nhenceforward he will use his mental powers; they are the spark which,\r\nfalling on a hearth, kindles into flame materials otherwise never\r\nutilised. And very often it is mere chance which puts into our hands\r\nsome book which makes a new starting-point in the evolution of our\r\nideas. The most casual circumstance, a few lines which happen to come\r\nunder our eye, decide our future and impel us into the path which\r\nthenceforward we shall follow. One winter evening, beside a stove where\r\nthe ashes were yet warm, while my family slept, I was forgetting, while\r\nI read, all the cares of the morrow—the black cares of the professor of\r\nphysics, who, after having piled one university diploma on another and\r\nrendered for a quarter of a century services whose merit was not\r\ndenied, earns for himself and family 1600 francs—less than a groom in a\r\nwell-to-do household. Such was the shameful parsimony of that day in\r\neducational matters; thus did Red tape will it. I was a free-lance, son\r\nof my solitary studies. Thus, amid my books I was putting aside acute\r\nprofessorial worries when I chanced to light on an entomological\r\npamphlet which had come into my hands I forget how. It was by the\r\npatriarch of entomology of that day, the venerable savant Léon Dufour,\r\non the habits of a Hymenopteron whose prey was the Buprestis. Certainly\r\nlong ere this I had felt a great interest in insects; from childhood I\r\nhad delighted in beetles, bees, and butterflies; as far back as I can\r\nrecollect I see myself enraptured by the splendours of a beetle’s\r\nelytra, or the wings of the great Swallowtail butterfly. The materials\r\nlay ready on the hearth, but the spark to kindle them had been lacking.\r\nThe accidental perusal of Léon Dufour’s pamphlet was that spark. I had\r\na mental revelation. So then to arrange lovely beetles in a cork box,\r\nto name and classify was not the whole of science; there was something\r\nfar superior, namely, the close study of the structure, and still more\r\nof the faculties of insects. Thrilled by emotion I read of a grand\r\ninstance of this. A little later, aided by those fortunate\r\ncircumstances which always befriend the ardent seeker, I published my\r\nfirst entomological work, the complement of Léon Dufour’s. It gained\r\nthe honours of the Institute of France, a prize for experimental\r\nphysiology being adjudged to it, and—far sweeter reward!—shortly after\r\nI received a most flattering and encouraging letter from the very man\r\nwho had inspired me. From far away in the Landes the venerated master\r\nsent me the cordial expression of his enthusiasm, and urged me to\r\ncontinue my studies. At that recollection my old eyes still grow wet\r\nwith a holy emotion. Oh, bright days of illusion, of faith in the\r\nfuture, what has become of you!\r\n\r\nI hope that the reader will not be sorry to meet with an extract from\r\nthe pamphlet which was the starting-point of my own researches, the\r\nmore so that it is necessary for the understanding of what follows. So\r\nI will let my Master speak, only abridging slightly:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    In all insect history I know of no fact more curious and\r\n    extraordinary than that which I am about to relate. It concerns a\r\n    species of Cerceris which feeds its progeny on the most splendid\r\n    kinds of Buprestis. Let me share with you, my friend, the vivid\r\n    impressions gained by studying the habits of this Hymenopteron. In\r\n    July 1839 a friend, who lives in the country, sent me two Buprestis\r\n    bifasciata, an insect new to my collection, telling me that a kind\r\n    of wasp which was carrying one of these pretty beetles had dropped\r\n    it on his coat, and that a few minutes later a similar wasp had let\r\n    fall another on the ground. In July 1840, having been called in as\r\n    physician by my friend, I reminded him of his capture of the\r\n    preceding year, and asked about the circumstances. Season and place\r\n    corresponding with it, I hoped to do as much myself, but that\r\n    particular day was dark and chilly, unfavourable therefore to the\r\n    flight of Hymenoptera. Nevertheless, we made a tour of inspection\r\n    in the garden walks, and seeing no insects I bethought myself of\r\n    seeking in the ground for the homes of burrowing Hymenoptera. A\r\n    tiny heap of sand recently thrown up, like a miniature mole-hill,\r\n    attracted my attention. Scratching it away, I saw that it masked\r\n    the orifice of a gallery descending far down. We carefully dug up\r\n    the ground with a spade, and soon caught sight of the shining\r\n    elytra of the coveted Buprestis. Soon I not only found wing-cases\r\n    but a whole Buprestis, nay, three and four displayed their gold and\r\n    emerald. I could not believe my eyes. But that was only the prelude\r\n    to my feast. In the chaos caused by my own exhumations a\r\n    Hymenopteron appeared and was taken by me; it was the captor of the\r\n    Buprestis, trying to escape from amid her victims. I recognised an\r\n    old acquaintance, a Cerceris which I have found some two hundred\r\n    times in Spain and around Saint Sever.\r\n\r\n    But my ambition was far from satisfied. It was not enough to know\r\n    ravisher and prey: I wanted the larva for which all this rich store\r\n    was laid up. After exhausting the first vein of Buprestis I\r\n    hastened to make new excavations. Digging down more carefully I\r\n    finally discovered two larvæ, which completed the good fortune of\r\n    this campaign. In less than an hour I turned over three haunts of\r\n    the Cerceris, and my booty was some fifteen whole Buprestids with\r\n    fragments of a yet greater number. I calculated, and I believe it\r\n    fell far short of the truth, that there were twenty-five nests in\r\n    this garden, a fact representing an immense number of buried\r\n    Buprestids. What must it be, I said to myself, in localities where\r\n    in a few hours I have caught as many as sixty Cerceris on\r\n    blossoming garlic, with nests most probably near, and no doubt\r\n    provisioned quite as abundantly! Imagination, backed by\r\n    probability, showed me underground, within a small space, B.\r\n    bifasciata by thousands, although I who have observed the\r\n    entomology of our parts for over thirty years have never noticed a\r\n    single one. Once only, perhaps twenty years ago, did I see,\r\n    sticking in a hole of an ancient oak, the abdomen and elytra of\r\n    this insect. This fact was a ray of light, for it told me that the\r\n    larva of B. bifasciata must live in the wood of the oak, and\r\n    entirely explained the abundance of this beetle in a district where\r\n    the forests consist chiefly of that tree. As Cerceris bupresticida\r\n    is rare on the clayey hills of the latter stretch of country\r\n    compared to the sandy plains where grows Pinus maritima, it became\r\n    an interesting question whether this Hymenopteron when it inhabits\r\n    the pine region provisions its nest as it does in the oak district.\r\n    I had good reason to believe that it did not, and you will soon see\r\n    with some surprise how exquisite is the entomological tact of our\r\n    Cerceris in her choice of the numerous kind of Buprestids.\r\n\r\n    Let us hasten to the pine region to taste new pleasures. The spot\r\n    to be explored is a garden belonging to a property in the midst of\r\n    forests of the maritime pines. The haunts of the Cerceris were soon\r\n    recognised; they were exclusively found in the main paths, where\r\n    the beaten and compact soil offered the burrowing Hymenoptera\r\n    sufficient solidity for the construction of their subterranean\r\n    dwellings. I visited some twenty, and I did it, I may say, by the\r\n    sweat of my brow. It is a very laborious kind of exploration, for\r\n    the nests and provisions are only found at the depth of one foot,\r\n    so that it is necessary to invest the place by a line of square\r\n    trenches seven or eight inches from the mouth of the hole, first\r\n    inserting a stalk of grass in the gallery by way of clue. One must\r\n    sap with a garden spade, so that the central clod, thoroughly\r\n    detached all round, may be raised in one piece, then reversed on\r\n    the ground and broken up carefully. Such is the manœuvre which I\r\n    found successful. You would have shared our enthusiasm at the sight\r\n    of the beautiful species of Buprestis which this new style of\r\n    research revealed to our eager gaze. You ought to have heard our\r\n    exclamations as each time the clod was reversed, new treasures were\r\n    revealed rendered yet more brilliant by the hot sun, or when we\r\n    discovered the larvæ of every age attached to their prey, or the\r\n    cocoons of these larvæ incrusted with copper, bronze, and emerald.\r\n    I who had been for three or four times ten years, alas! a practical\r\n    entomologist had never beheld such an enchanting sight or had had\r\n    such good fortune. We only wanted you to double our enjoyment. With\r\n    ever increasing admiration we dwelt now on the brilliant Coleoptera\r\n    and now on the marvellous sagacity of the Cerceris which had buried\r\n    and laid them up for food. Can you believe it? Out of more than 400\r\n    beetles dug up, there was not one which did not belong to the old\r\n    genus Buprestis! Our Hymenopteron had not committed the smallest\r\n    error. How much there is to learn from this intelligent industry in\r\n    so small an insect! What value Latreille would have attached to the\r\n    vote of this Cerceris in favour of the natural system! [5]\r\n\r\n    Let us pass on to the various contrivances of the Cerceris in\r\n    making and provisioning her nest. I have already said that she\r\n    chooses ground whose surface is beaten, compact, and solid. I\r\n    should add that this ground must be dry and in full sunshine. This\r\n    choice shows an intelligence, or, if you like, an instinct, which\r\n    one is tempted to believe is the result of experience. Crumbly\r\n    earth or mere sand would of course be easier to work, but then how\r\n    construct an orifice which will remain wide open for ingress and\r\n    exit, and a gallery whose walls will not constantly fall in, yield,\r\n    and become blocked by the least rain? The choice is therefore both\r\n    reasonable and perfectly well calculated.\r\n\r\n    Our burrowing Hymenopteron hollows her gallery with her mandibles\r\n    and front tarsi, which accordingly are furnished with stiff points\r\n    to act as rakes. The orifice must not only have the diameter of the\r\n    miner’s body, but be able to admit a prey of larger bulk. This\r\n    shows admirable forethought. As the Cerceris digs deeper she brings\r\n    out the rubbish, and this makes the heap which I compared to a tiny\r\n    molehill. The gallery is not vertical, as this would have exposed\r\n    it to be filled up by wind or other causes. Not far from the\r\n    starting-point it makes an angle; its length is from seven to eight\r\n    inches. At the far end the industrious mother establishes the\r\n    cradle of her progeny. Five cells, separate and independent of one\r\n    another, are hollowed in the shape and nearly of the size of an\r\n    olive; within they are solid and polished. Each can contain three\r\n    Buprestids, the ordinary allowance for a larva. The Cerceris lays\r\n    an egg amid the three victims, and then stops up the gallery with\r\n    earth, so that when once the provisions for the brood are laid in,\r\n    the cells have no communication with the outside.\r\n\r\n    Cerceris bupresticida must be an indefatigable, daring, and skilful\r\n    huntress. The cleanness, the freshness of the beetles which she\r\n    buries in her den testify that they are seized just as they emerge\r\n    from the wooden galleries where their final metamorphosis takes\r\n    place. But what inconceivable instinct urges a creature that lives\r\n    solely on the nectar of flowers to seek amid a thousand\r\n    difficulties animal food for carnivorous offspring, which it will\r\n    never see, and to post itself on trees quite unlike one another,\r\n    which hide deep in their trunks the insects which are to fall her\r\n    victims? What entomological tact, yet more inconceivable, makes her\r\n    lay down a strict law to select them in a single generic group, and\r\n    to catch species differing very considerably in size, shape, and\r\n    colour? You observe how unlike are Buprestis biguttata, with its\r\n    slender long body and dark colour; B. octoguttata, oval-oblong,\r\n    with great stains of a beautiful yellow on a blue or green ground;\r\n    and B. micans, three or four times the size of B. biguttata, with a\r\n    splendid metallic greeny gold.\r\n\r\n    There is another very singular fact in the manœuvres of our\r\n    assassin of Buprestids. The buried ones, like those which I have\r\n    seized in the grasp of their murderers, give no sign of life, and\r\n    are unquestionably quite dead, yet, as I observed with surprise, no\r\n    matter when they are dug up, not only do they keep all their\r\n    freshness of colour, but every bit of them—feet, antennæ, palpi,\r\n    and the membranes which unite the various parts of their bodies—is\r\n    perfectly supple and flexible. At first one supposes the\r\n    explanation, as far as concerns the buried ones, to be in the\r\n    coolness of the ground, and absence of air and light, and for those\r\n    taken from their murderers, in the very recent date of death. But\r\n    observe that after my explorations, having isolated in cones of\r\n    paper the numerous Buprestids dug up, I have often left them over\r\n    thirty-six hours before pinning them out. And yet, notwithstanding\r\n    the dryness and great heat of July, I have always found the same\r\n    flexibility in the joints. More than this, after that lapse of\r\n    time, I have dissected several, and their visceræ were as perfectly\r\n    preserved as if I had used my scalpel on the live insect. Now, long\r\n    experience has taught me that even in a beetle of this size, when\r\n    twelve hours have passed in summer after its death, the interior\r\n    organs are either dried up or corrupted so that it is impossible to\r\n    be sure of form or structure. There is some peculiarity about\r\n    Buprestids put to death by the Cerceris which prevents corruption\r\n    or desiccation for a week, or perhaps two. But what is this\r\n    peculiarity?\r\n\r\n\r\nTo explain this wonderful preservation which makes an insect dead for\r\nseveral weeks into a piece of game not even high, but, on the contrary,\r\nas fresh as when first caught, and that during the greatest heat of\r\nsummer, the skilful historian of Cerceris bupresticida supposes that\r\nthere must be an antiseptic liquid acting as do the preparations used\r\nin preserving anatomical specimens. This liquid can only be the poison\r\ninjected by the Hymenopteron into the body of the victim. A minute\r\nglobule of the venomous humour accompanying the dart or lancet,\r\ndestined for this purpose, acts as a kind of pickle or antiseptic fluid\r\nto preserve the flesh on which the larva is to feed. But then how\r\nsuperior to our processes are those of the Cerceris with regard to\r\npreserved food! We salt or smoke or enclose in tins hermetically sealed\r\nprovisions which remain eatable, to be sure, but which are far, very\r\nfar from having the qualities of fresh meat. Sardines drowned in oil,\r\nDutch smoked herrings, cod hardened into slabs by salt and sun,—can any\r\nof these sustain comparison with the same fish brought alive to the\r\nkitchen? For meat properly so-called it is still worse. Beyond salting\r\nand drying we have nothing which even for a short period can keep meat\r\neatable. At the present time, after innumerable fruitless attempts of\r\nthe most varied kind, special ships are equipped at great cost, which,\r\nfurnished with powerful freezing apparatus, convey to us the flesh of\r\nsheep and oxen slaughtered in the Pampas of South America, frozen and\r\nkept from corruption by intense cold. How far superior is the method of\r\nthe Cerceris, so rapid, so cheap, so expeditious! What lessons we\r\nshould have to learn from such transcendental chemistry when an\r\nimperceptible drop of liquid poison renders in an instant the prey\r\nincorruptible! What am I saying?—incorruptible?—that is far from being\r\nall; the game is put into a condition which prevents desiccation,\r\nleaves their suppleness to the limbs, and maintains all the organs in\r\npristine freshness, both the internal and external. In short, the\r\nCerceris puts the insect into a state differing only from life by a\r\ncorpse-like immobility.\r\n\r\nSuch is the conclusion arrived at by Léon Dufour before this\r\nincomprehensible marvel of the dead Buprestis untouched by corruption.\r\nAn antiseptic fluid, incomparably superior to anything that human\r\nscience could produce, would explain the mystery. He, the Master,\r\nskilful of the skilful, thoroughly used to most delicate anatomy; he\r\nwho with magnifying glass and scalpel has scrutinised the whole circuit\r\nof entomology, leaving no corner unexplored; he, in short, for whom the\r\norganisation of insects has no secrets,—can advance no better\r\nconjecture than an antiseptic liquid to give at least a kind of\r\nexplanation of a fact which leaves him confounded. Let me insist on\r\nthis comparison between the instinct of the animal and the reason of\r\nthe sage in order the better to demonstrate in due time the\r\noverwhelming superiority of the former.\r\n\r\nI will add but a few words to the history of the C. bupresticida. This\r\nHymenopteron, common in the Landes, as we have heard, seems to be rare\r\nin the department of Vaucluse. It is only at long intervals that I have\r\nmet with it, in autumn, and always isolated specimens, on the spiny\r\nheads of Eryngium campestre, in the environs of Avignon or round Orange\r\nand Carpentras. In the latter spot, so favourable to burrowing\r\nhymenoptera, from its sandy soil of Mollasse, I had the good fortune,\r\nnot indeed of being present at the exhumation of such entomological\r\nriches as Léon Dufour describes, but of finding some old nests which I\r\nfeel certain belonged to Cerceris bupresticida, from the shape of the\r\ncocoons, the kind of provender stored up, and the existence of the\r\nHymenopteron in the neighbourhood. These nests, hollowed in a very\r\nfriable sandstone, called safre in those parts, were filled with\r\nremains of beetles, easily recognised, and consisting of detached\r\nwing-cases, empty corslets, and whole feet. Now these remains of the\r\nlarva’s feast all belonged to one species, and this was a Buprestis,\r\nSphænoptera geminata. Thus from the west to the east of France, from\r\nthe department of the Landes to Vaucluse, the Cerceris remains faithful\r\nto its favourite prey; longitude does not affect its predilections, a\r\nhunter of Buprestids among the maritime pines of the ocean sand-hills,\r\nit is equally so amid the evergreen oaks and olives of Provence. The\r\nspecies is changed according to place, climate, and vegetation—causes\r\ninfluencing greatly the insect population, but the Cerceris keeps to\r\nits chosen genus, the Buprestis. For what strange reason? That is what\r\nI shall try to demonstrate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nCERCERIS TUBERCULATA\r\n\r\n\r\nWith my mind full of the great deeds of the Buprestis hunter, I watched\r\nfor an opportunity of observing in my turn the labours of the Cerceris,\r\nand I watched so closely that finally I got my chance. True, it was not\r\nthe Hymenopteron celebrated by Dufour, with such sumptuous provisions\r\nthat when dug up they made one think of the powder from a nugget broken\r\nby the miner’s pickaxe in some gold field: it was a closely related\r\nspecies, a giant brigand which contents itself with more modest prey—in\r\nshort, Cerceris tuberculata or C. major, the largest and strongest of\r\nthe genus.\r\n\r\nThe last fortnight in September is the time when our Hymenopteron makes\r\nits burrows, and buries in the depths the prey destined for its brood.\r\nThe position of the domicile, always sagaciously chosen, is governed by\r\nthose mysterious laws varying with the species, but unchangeable for\r\nany one of them. The Cerceris of Léon Dufour requires a horizontal,\r\nbeaten, compact soil, like that of a path, to avoid landslips and\r\nchanges which would ruin its gallery with the first rain. Ours, on the\r\ncontrary, selects vertical ground. By this slight architectural\r\nmodification she avoids most of the dangers which might threaten her\r\ntunnel; therefore she is not particular as to the nature of the soil,\r\nand hollows her gallery either in friable earth with a little clay, or\r\nin the crumbling soil of the Mollasse, which makes the labour of\r\nexcavation much easier. The only indispensable condition seems to be\r\nthat the soil should be dry, and exposed to the sun for the greater\r\npart of the day. It is therefore in the steep bank along a road, and in\r\nthe sides of hollows made by rain in the sandy Mollasse, that our\r\nHymenopteron makes its abode. Such conditions are frequent near\r\nCarpentras in what is known as the hollow way, and it is there that I\r\nhave found C. tuberculata in the greatest abundance, and have collected\r\nmost of the facts relating to its history.\r\n\r\nIt is not enough to choose this vertical situation; other precautions\r\nare taken to guard against the already advanced season. If some bit of\r\nhard sandstone project like a shelf, or if a hole the size of one’s\r\nfist should have been hollowed naturally in the ground, it will be\r\nunder this shelter or in this cavity that the gallery is made, a\r\nnatural vestibule being thus added by the Cerceris to its own edifice.\r\nAlthough there is no kind of community among them, these insects like\r\nto associate in small parties, and I have always found their nests in\r\ngroups of about ten, with orifices, though usually far apart, sometimes\r\ntouching.\r\n\r\nWhen the sun shines it is wonderful to see the ways of these\r\nhard-working miners. Some patiently extract bits of gravel from the\r\nbottom of a hole with their mandibles, and push out the heavy mass;\r\nothers scratch the walls of their tunnel with the sharp rakes of their\r\ntarsi, forming a heap of rubbish which they sweep out backward, and\r\nsend sliding down the steep incline in long dusty streams. It was these\r\nperiodical sand waves thrown out of galleries in process of\r\nconstruction which betrayed my first Cerceris, and led to the discovery\r\nof the nests. Others, either weary, or having completed their hard\r\ntask, rested and polished their antennæ and wings under the natural\r\ncaves which usually protect their dwelling, or else sat motionless at\r\nthe mouth of their holes, only displaying their wide, square faces,\r\nbarred with yellow and black. Others again were flying with a deep hum\r\non the bushes near the cochineal oak, where the males, always on the\r\nwatch near the burrows in process of construction, speedily join them.\r\nCouples form, often troubled by the arrival of a second male, which\r\ntries to supplant the happy possessor. The humming grows menacing,\r\nquarrels begin, and often both males roll in the dust until one\r\nacknowledges the superiority of his rival. Not far off the female waits\r\nwith indifference the upshot of the struggle, accepting finally the\r\nmale bestowed on her by the chances of the fight, and the pair fly out\r\nof sight to seek peace in some distant thicket. Here the part of the\r\nmale ends. One half smaller than the females, they prowl about the\r\nburrows but never enter, and never take any part in the hard work of\r\nexcavation, or that perhaps yet harder of provisioning the cells.\r\n\r\nIn a few days the galleries are ready, especially as after some repairs\r\nthose of the preceding year are used again. Other Cerceris, as far as I\r\nknow, have no fixed home, transmitted from one generation to another.\r\nTrue Bohemians, they establish themselves wherever the chances of their\r\nvagabond life may lead them, so long as the soil suits them. But C.\r\ntuberculata is faithful to her penates. The projecting shelf of\r\nsandstone used by its predecessors is used again; it hollows out the\r\nsame layer of sand hollowed by its forbears, and, adding its own labour\r\nto theirs, obtains deep-seated retreats sometimes only visited with\r\ndifficulty. The diameter of the galleries would admit a thumb, and the\r\ninsect can move about easily, even when laden with the prey which we\r\nshall see it capture. Their direction is horizontal, from four to eight\r\ninches, then makes a sudden turn downward more or less obliquely, now\r\nin one direction, now in another. Except the horizontal part, and the\r\nangle of the tunnel, the direction seems to depend on the difficulties\r\nof the ground, as is proved by the windings and changes in the farthest\r\npart of this kind of canal, which is half a yard in length. At the far\r\nend are the cells, not numerous, and provisioned with five or six dead\r\nbeetles. But let us leave the details of how a Cerceris builds, and\r\nturn to more wonderful facts.\r\n\r\nThe victim chosen to feed the larvæ is a large weevil (Cleonus\r\nophthalmicus). One sees the captor arrive, carrying the victim between\r\nits feet, body to body, head to head. It alights heavily some way from\r\nthe hole to complete the journey without the aid of wings, and drags\r\nthe prey laboriously with its jaws, on ground if not vertical, at least\r\nvery steeply inclined, which often results in sending captor and\r\ncaptive headlong to the bottom, but the indefatigable mother finally\r\ndarts into her burrow, covered with dust, but with the prey of which\r\nshe has never let go. If she does not find walking with such a burden\r\neasy, it is otherwise with her flight, which is surprisingly powerful,\r\nif one considers that the strong little creature is carrying a prey\r\nnearly as large as and heavier than herself. I have had the curiosity\r\nto weigh the Cerceris and her prey separately, and the first weighed\r\n150 milligrammes, and the second about 250, almost double.\r\n\r\nThese weights speak eloquently for the vigorous huntress, and I never\r\nwearied of watching how swiftly and easily she resumed her flight, and\r\nrose out of sight with the game between her feet when approached too\r\nclosely. But she did not always fly away, and then, though it was\r\ndifficult to do so, and yet avoid hurting her, I would make her drop\r\nthe prey by worrying and upsetting her with a straw. Then I would take\r\npossession of the victim, and the Cerceris, thus despoiled, would hunt\r\nabout, go into her hole for a moment, come out, and resume the chase.\r\nIn less than ten minutes the sharp-sighted insect would find a new\r\nvictim, murder it and carry it off, not seldom to my profit. Eight\r\ntimes running have I stolen from the same individual; eight times did\r\nthe indefatigable Cerceris resume her fruitless journey. Her\r\nperseverance tired out mine, and I let her keep the ninth capture.\r\n\r\nBy this means, and by breaking open cells already filled with\r\nprovisions, I got nearly a hundred weevils, and in spite of what I had\r\na right to expect from what Léon Dufour has told us of the habits of\r\nthe Cerceris bupresticida, I could not repress my astonishment at the\r\nsight of the singular collection which I had made. His Cerceris, though\r\nit limits itself to one genus, yet takes any species within that limit,\r\nbut the more exclusive C. tuberculata preys exclusively on Cleonus\r\nophthalmicus. On looking through my booty I met with but one single\r\nexception, and that belonged to a closely allied species, C.\r\nalternans—one which I never met with again in my frequent visits to the\r\nCerceris. Later researches furnished me with a second exception,\r\nBothynoderes albidus, and these are all. Can a specially succulent and\r\nsavoury prey explain this predilection for a single species? Do the\r\nlarvæ find in this unvaried diet juices which suit them peculiarly, and\r\nwhich they would not find elsewhere? I do not think so, and if Léon\r\nDufour’s Cerceris hunted all the kinds of Buprestids, no doubt it was\r\nbecause they all have the same nutritive properties. But this must\r\ngenerally be the case with all the Curculionidæ; their alimentary\r\nproperties must be identical, and in that case this amazing choice can\r\nonly be one of size, and therefore of economy of labour and time. Our\r\nCerceris, the giant of its race, chooses C. ophthalmicus as the largest\r\nin our district, and perhaps the commonest. But if this favourite prey\r\nfail, it must fall back upon other species, even if smaller, as is\r\nproved by the two exceptions above mentioned.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it is by no means the only one to hunt the long-nosed class\r\nof weevils. Many other Cerceris, according to their size, strength, and\r\nthe chances of the chase, capture Curculionidæ most various in genus,\r\nspecies, shape, and size. It has long been known that Cerceris arenaria\r\nfeeds her young with similar food. I myself have found in its burrows\r\nSitona lineata, S. tibialis, Cneorhinus hispidus, Brachyderes gracilis,\r\nGeonemus flabellipes, Otiorhynchus maleficus. Cerceris aurita is known\r\nto prey on Otiorhynchus raucus and Phytonomus punctatus. In the larder\r\nof Cerceris ferreri I saw Phytonomus murinus, P. punctatus, Sitona\r\nlineata, Cneorhinus hispidus, Rhynchites betuleti. This weevil, which\r\nrolls up vine leaves into the shape of cigars, is sometimes of a superb\r\nmetallic blue, but more usually of a splendid golden copper. I have\r\nfound as many as seven of these brilliant insects laid up in one cell,\r\nand the gorgeous colours of the little heap might almost bear\r\ncomparison with the jewels buried by the huntress of the Buprestids.\r\nOther species, especially the weaker, hunt smaller game, the lesser\r\nsize being compensated by numbers. Thus, Cerceris quadricincta heaps in\r\neach cell some thirty Apion gravidum, but does not disdain on occasion\r\nbigger weevils, such as Sitona lineata, Phytonomus murinus. Cerceris\r\nlabiata also lays up small species. Finally, the smallest Cerceris in\r\nmy part of France, C. julii, hunts the least weevils, Apion gravidum\r\nand Bruchus granarius, game proportioned to its own size. To end this\r\nlist of provender, let us add that some Cerceris follow other\r\ngastronomic laws, and bring up their families on Hymenoptera. Such is\r\nC. ornata. These tastes being alien to our subject, let us pass on.\r\n\r\nWe see that out of eight species of Cerceris which lay up Coleoptera as\r\nfood, seven hunt weevils and one Buprestids. What singular reason\r\nconfines the chase of these Hymenoptera within such narrow limits? What\r\nare the motives of such an exclusive selection? What internal likeness\r\nis there between the Buprestids and the weevils, outwardly quite\r\ndissimilar, that both should become food for carnivorous and nearly\r\nrelated larvæ? No doubt between such and such a victim there are\r\ndifferences as to taste and nutritive qualities which the larvæ\r\nthoroughly appreciate, but there must be a far graver reason than these\r\ngastronomic considerations to explain these strange predilections.\r\n\r\nAfter all that has been so admirably said by Léon Dufour on the long\r\nand marvellous preservation of the insects destined as food for the\r\ncarnivorous larvæ, it is needless to say that the weevils which I dug\r\nup, as well as those taken from between the feet of their murderer,\r\nwere perfectly fresh, though permanently motionless. Freshness of\r\ncolour, suppleness of the membranes and smallest articulations, normal\r\ncondition of the viscera, all combine to make one doubt whether the\r\ninert body under one’s eyes can really be a corpse, all the more that\r\neven under the magnifying glass it is impossible to perceive the\r\nsmallest wound; and in spite of one’s self one expects every moment to\r\nsee the insect move and walk. Yet more, in weather so hot that insects\r\nwhich had died naturally would in a few hours have become dried up and\r\ncrumbly, or again in damp weather which would with equal rapidity have\r\nmade them decay and grow mouldy. I have kept specimens in glass tubes\r\nor cones of paper over a month with no precautions, and wonderful to\r\nsay, after all this length of time, the intestines were as fresh as\r\never, and I found dissection as easy as if the creatures were alive.\r\nNo, in presence of such facts one cannot talk of an antiseptic, and\r\nbelieve in real death; life is still there—life latent and\r\npassive—vegetative life. It alone, struggling successfully for a time\r\nagainst the destructive invasion of chemical forces, can thus preserve\r\nthe organism from decomposition. Life is still there, but without\r\nmotion, and we have under our eyes such a marvel as chloroform or ether\r\nmight produce—a marvel caused by the mysterious laws of the nervous\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nThe functions of this vegetative life are slackened and troubled no\r\ndoubt, but still they are feebly exercised. I have the proof of this in\r\nthat action of the viscera which takes place normally and at intervals\r\nin the weevils during the first week of that deep slumber, which will\r\nnever be broken, and yet which is not death. It only ceases when the\r\nintestine is empty, as is shown by autopsy. But the faint rays of life\r\nwhich the creature manifests do not stop there; and though sensation\r\nappears annihilated for ever, I have succeeded in reawakening some\r\nvestige of them. Having placed weevils, recently exhumed and absolutely\r\nmotionless, in a bottle with sawdust moistened with benzine, I was not\r\na little surprised to see a quarter of an hour later moving antennæ and\r\nfeet. For a moment I thought I could recall them to life. Vain hope!\r\nthese movements, last trace of a sensitiveness about to cease, soon\r\nstopped, and could not be excited a second time. I have repeated this\r\nexperiment from some hours to several days after the murder, and always\r\nwith the same success; only movement is tardy in appearing in\r\nproportion as the date of the victim’s death is distant. The movements\r\nare always from the forepart backward. First, the antennæ move, then\r\nthe front tarsi tremble and share in the oscillations; next, the second\r\npair do the same; and finally, the third. Once movement is excited, all\r\nthese members oscillate without any order until all become again\r\nmotionless, as they do sooner or later. Unless death has been quite\r\nrecent, movement does not go beyond the tarsi, and the legs remain\r\nmotionless.\r\n\r\nTen days after the murder I could not obtain the least sign of\r\nirritability by the proceeding described, and I had recourse to the\r\nVoltaic battery. This is more effective, and provokes muscular\r\ncontractions where the vapour of benzine fails. One or two elements of\r\nBunsen suffice, which are armed with the rheophores of slender needles.\r\nPlunging the point of the one under the furthest ring of the abdomen,\r\nand the point of the other under the neck, you obtain each time that\r\nthe current is established, not only the quivering of the tarsi, but a\r\nstrong flexion of the feet, which fold themselves under the body, and\r\nrelax when the current is interrupted. These movements, very energetic\r\nduring the first days, gradually lose intensity, and after a certain\r\ntime appear no more. On the tenth day I have still been able to obtain\r\nvisible motions, but on the fifteenth the pile was unable to provoke\r\nthem, notwithstanding the suppleness of the limbs and freshness of the\r\nviscera. I have submitted also to the action of the pile Coleoptera\r\nreally dead, Blaps, Saperda, Lamia, asphyxiated by benzine or\r\nsulphureous gas, and two hours later it was impossible to provoke the\r\nmovements obtained so easily from weevils lying already for several\r\ndays in the singular state, intermediate between life and death, into\r\nwhich their redoubtable enemy plunges them.\r\n\r\nAll these facts contradict the supposition of an animal completely\r\ndead, and the hypothesis of a real corpse rendered incorruptible by\r\nsome antiseptic liquid. One can only explain them by admitting that the\r\nanimal is struck in the principle of its movements, and that\r\nsensitiveness, suddenly benumbed, dies slowly out, while the more\r\ntenacious, vegetative functions die yet more slowly and preserve the\r\nintestines during the time necessary for the larva.\r\n\r\nThe most important detail to show was how the murder is committed.\r\nEvidently, the chief part must be played by the poisoned dart of the\r\nCerceris. But where and how does it penetrate the body of the weevil,\r\ncovered with a hard cuirass, with pieces so closely joined? Even under\r\nthe magnifying glass nothing told where the sting entered. Direct\r\nexamination, therefore, was required to discover the murderous ways of\r\nthe Cerceris—a problem before whose difficulties Léon Dufour had\r\nalready recoiled, and the solution of which seemed to me for a time\r\nimpossible. I tried, however, and had the satisfaction of succeeding,\r\nthough not without some groping about.\r\n\r\nWhen they fly from their holes to the chase, the Cerceris go here and\r\nthere, sometimes on one side, sometimes on the other, and return from\r\nall directions, loaded with prey, so that they must seek it on all\r\nsides; but as they barely take ten minutes between going and returning,\r\nthe space worked over could not be very great, especially considering\r\nthe time necessary to discover the prey, to attack and render it an\r\ninert mass. I, therefore, set myself to examine all the adjacent ground\r\nwith close attention, hoping to discover some Cerceris on the hunt. One\r\nafternoon devoted to this weary work convinced me of the uselessness of\r\nmy researches, and of the little chance I had of surprising any of the\r\nfew Cerceris, scattered here and there, and soon lost to view by their\r\nrapid flight; above all, in difficult ground, planted with olives, I\r\ngave up the attempt. But by carrying live weevils to the neighbourhood\r\nof the nests might I not tempt the Cerceris by a prey found without\r\ntrouble, and so observe the drama? The notion seemed good, and the very\r\nnext day I set out to find live Cleonus ophthalmicus. Vineyards,\r\nwheat-fields, and crops of lucerne, and heaps of stones did I visit and\r\nexamine one and all, and after two days of close search I\r\npossessed—dare I own it?—three weevils! bare, dusty, maimed of antennæ\r\nor tarsi, shabby old creatures which, perhaps, the Cerceris would not\r\ntouch! Since the day of that fevered search, when, for a weevil’s sake,\r\nI bathed myself in perspiration during my wild expedition, many a year\r\nhas passed, and yet, in spite of almost daily entomological researches,\r\nI am still ignorant of the life and habits of this Cleonus, which I met\r\nhere and there, straying on the edge of paths. Wonderful powers of\r\ninstinct! in the same spots, and in a fraction of time, one\r\nHymenopteron would have found hundreds of these insects which man\r\ncannot find, and found them fresh and shining, no doubt just emerged\r\nfrom the cocoon!\r\n\r\nNo matter; let us experiment with my wretched victim. A Cerceris has\r\njust gone into her gallery with her prey; before she comes out for a\r\nnew expedition I place a weevil a few inches from her hole. The weevil\r\nmoves about; when it strays too far I bring it back to its place. At\r\nlast the Cerceris shows her wide face at the mouth of her hole; my\r\nheart beats fast. She walks for a few minutes near her dwelling, sees\r\nthe weevil, brushes against it, turns, passes several times over its\r\nback, and flies off without even honouring my captive with a bite—my\r\ncaptive which cost me so much labour! I was confounded—knocked over.\r\nNew attempts at other holes, new disappointments. Decidedly these\r\ndainty hunters will have none of the game which I offer them. Perhaps\r\nthey find it too old, too tasteless; perhaps, in handling it, I\r\ncommunicated some smell to it which displeases them. Foreign contact\r\ndisgusts these connoisseurs.\r\n\r\nShould I be more fortunate if I obliged the Cerceris to defend herself?\r\nI enclosed one with a Cleonus in a bottle, irritating them by shaking\r\nit. The Hymenopteron, sensitive by nature, was more impressed than the\r\nother prisoner, with its dull, heavy organisation; she thought of\r\nescape, not attack. Their parts were exchanged; the weevil became the\r\naggressor, sometimes seizing with the end of its trunk a foot of its\r\nmortal foe, who made no attempt at defence, so terrified was she. I\r\ncould devise nothing more; my desire to be present at the dénoûment had\r\nonly added to former difficulties. Well, let us try again.\r\n\r\nA luminous idea flashed upon me, bringing hope, so naturally did it\r\ntouch the very heart of the question. Of course, it was the right thing\r\nand must succeed. My disdained game must be offered to the Cerceris in\r\nthe heat of the chase—then, absorbed and preoccupied, she will not\r\ndiscover its imperfections. I have already said that on returning from\r\nthe chase the Cerceris alights at the foot of the incline at some\r\ndistance from the hole, whither she laboriously drags the prey. What I\r\nthen had to do was to deprive her of her victim, drawing it away by one\r\nfoot with pincers, and instantly throwing her the living weevil in\r\nexchange. This manœuvre succeeded perfectly. As soon as the Cerceris\r\nfelt the prey slip under her body and escape her, she stamped with\r\nimpatience, turned round, and perceiving the weevil which had replaced\r\nhers, flung herself upon it and clasped it in order to carry it away.\r\nBut she promptly perceived that this prey was alive, and then the drama\r\nbegan and ended with inconceivable rapidity. The Cerceris faced her\r\nvictim, seized its proboscis with her powerful jaws and grasped it\r\nvigorously, and while the weevil reared itself up, pressed her forefeet\r\nhard on its back as if to force open some ventral articulation. Then\r\nthe tail of the murderess slid under the Cleonus, curved and darted its\r\npoisoned lancet swiftly two or three times at the joining of the\r\nprothorax, between the first and second pair of feet. In a twinkling\r\nall was over. Without one convulsive movement, with no motion of the\r\nlimbs such as accompany the death of an animal, the victim fell\r\nmotionless for ever, as if annihilated. It was at once wonderful and\r\nterrible in its rapidity. Then the assassin turned the Weevil on its\r\nback, placing herself body to body with it, her legs on either side of\r\nit, and flew off. Three times I renewed the experiment with my three\r\nWeevils, and the same scene was always enacted.\r\n\r\nOf course, each time I gave the Cerceris back her first prey and\r\nwithdrew my Cleonus to examine it at greater leisure. This examination\r\nonly confirmed my opinion of the terrible skill of the assassin. It is\r\nimpossible to find the slightest trace of a wound, or the smallest flow\r\nof vital liquids from the point which was struck. But the most striking\r\nthing is the rapid, complete annihilation of all movement. Vainly did I\r\nseek even immediately after the murder for any trace of sensibility in\r\nthe three Weevils done to death under my eyes—neither pinching nor\r\npricking provoked it; to do so required the artificial means already\r\nmentioned. Thus these robust Cleonus, which, pierced alive with a pin\r\nand fixed by a collector on his fatal sheet of cork, would have\r\nstruggled for days, weeks, nay, whole months, instantly lose all power\r\nof motion from the effect of a little prick which inoculates them with\r\na minute drop of poison. Chemistry knows none so active in so small a\r\ndose; scarcely could prussic acid produce such an effect, if, indeed,\r\nit could do so at all. It is not then to toxology, but to physiology\r\nand anatomy that we must turn to find the cause of such instantaneous\r\ncatalepsy; it is not so much the great virulence of the poison\r\ninjected, as the importance of the organ injured by it which we must\r\nconsider in order to explain these marvels. What, then, is found at the\r\npoint where the sting penetrates?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nONE SKILFUL TO SLAY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hymenopteron has partly revealed her secret by showing us where the\r\nsting strikes. But does that explain the question? Not yet, by any\r\nmeans. Let us retrace our steps, forget for a moment what the insect\r\nhas taught us, and consider the problem set before the Cerceris. The\r\nproblem is this: to lay up in an underground cell a certain number of\r\nheads of game which may suffice to nourish the larva hatched from the\r\negg laid upon the heap of provender.\r\n\r\nAt first sight this storing of food appears simple enough, but\r\nreflexion soon discovers graver difficulties. Our own game is brought\r\ndown by a shot and killed with horrible wounds. The Hymenopteron has\r\nrefinements unknown to us; she chooses to have her prey intact, with\r\nall its elegance of form and colour. No broken limbs, no gaping wounds,\r\nno hideous disembowelment. Her prey has all the freshness of the living\r\ninsect; she does not destroy an atom of the fine-coloured powder which\r\nthe mere contact of our fingers deflowers. If the insect were really\r\ndead, really a corpse, how difficult it would be for us to obtain such\r\na result! Any one can slay an insect by stamping brutally on it, but to\r\nkill it neatly leaving no sign is no easy operation, within every one’s\r\npower. How many of us would be at our wits’ end if we had to kill on\r\nthe spot, without crushing it, a little creature so tenacious of life\r\nthat even beheaded it still goes on struggling! One must have been a\r\npractical entomologist before thinking of asphyxiation, and here,\r\nagain, success would be doubtful with the primitive methods of vapour\r\nof benzine or burnt sulphur. In this deleterious atmosphere the insect\r\nstruggles too long, and tarnishes its brightness. One must have\r\nrecourse to more heroic methods—for instance, to the terrible\r\nexhalations of prussic acid slowly disengaging themselves from strips\r\nof paper impregnated with cyanide of potassium, or better still, as\r\nbeing without danger to the collector, to the thunderbolt of vapour of\r\nbisulphide of carbon. It requires a real art, an art calling to its aid\r\nthe redoubtable arsenal of chemistry, to kill an insect neatly; to do\r\nthat is what the elegant method of the Cerceris brings about so\r\nquickly, if we admit the stupid supposition that her prey really\r\nbecomes a dead body.\r\n\r\nA dead body! But that is by no means the diet of the larvæ, little\r\nogres greedy for fresh meat, to whom game ever so slightly tainted\r\nwould inspire insurmountable disgust. They must have fresh meat with no\r\nhigh taste—that first sign of decay. Yet the prey cannot be laid up\r\nalive in the cell like animals destined to furnish fresh meat to the\r\ncrew and passengers of a vessel. What would become of a delicate egg\r\nlaid among living food? What would become of the feeble larva, a worm\r\nbruised by the slightest thing among vigorous Coleoptera moving their\r\nlong spurred legs for whole weeks? It is absolutely necessary—and here\r\nwe seem caught in a blind alley—to obtain deathly immobility with the\r\nfreshness of life for the interior organs. Before such an alimentary\r\nproblem the best instructed man of the world would stand helpless—even\r\nthe practised entomologist would own himself at a loss. The larder of\r\nthe Cerceris would defy their reasoning powers.\r\n\r\nLet us then imagine an academy of entomologists and physiologists, a\r\ncongress where the question should be discussed by Flourens, Majendies,\r\nClaude Bernards. To obtain at once complete immobility and long\r\npreservation of food, the first and most natural and simple idea would\r\nbe that of preserved meats. One would invoke some antiseptic liquid, as\r\nthe illustrious savant of the Landes did with regard to his Buprestids,\r\nand attribute such virtue to the poisonous fluid of the Cerceris, but\r\nthis strange quality has yet to be proved. Gratuitous hypothesis\r\nreplacing the unknown quantity of the preserving liquid may perhaps be\r\nthe final verdict of the learned assembly, as it was that of the\r\nnaturalist of the Landes.\r\n\r\nShould one insist and explain that the larvæ require not preserved food\r\nwhich could never have the properties of flesh still palpitating, but\r\nprey yet alive, so to say, in spite of complete absence of motion, the\r\nlearned Congress, after ripe consideration, will fall back upon\r\nparalysis: “Yes, of course; the creature has to be paralysed without\r\nbeing killed.” There is but one means of arriving at this result,\r\nnamely, to injure, cut, and destroy the nervous system of the insect in\r\none or more skilfully chosen points.\r\n\r\nIf the question be thus left in hands unfamiliar with the secrets of a\r\ndelicate anatomy it will not have advanced far. What is the arrangement\r\nof this nervous system which must be paralysed without killing the\r\ninsect? First, where is it? In the head no doubt and along the back,\r\nlike the brain and spinal marrow in the superior animals. “A grave\r\nmistake!” our congress would reply; the insect is so to say an animal\r\nreversed, which walks on its back—that is, it has the spinal marrow\r\nbelow instead of above, all along breast and stomach; therefore on the\r\nlower surface alone can the operation to paralyse the insect be\r\nperformed.\r\n\r\nThis difficulty removed, a far graver one presents itself. Armed with\r\nhis scalpel, the anatomist can direct its point where he will in spite\r\nof obstacles which he may have to set aside. The Hymenopteron has no\r\nchoice. Its victim is a solidly cuirassed beetle, its lancet a dart,\r\nextremely delicate, which the horny mail would certainly turn aside.\r\nOnly certain points are vulnerable to the frail tool, namely, the\r\njoints, protected simply by a membrane with no power of resistance. But\r\nthe joints of the limbs, although vulnerable, do not in the least\r\nfulfil the necessary conditions, for through these the utmost that\r\ncould be obtained is local paralysis, not one affecting the whole\r\norganism of motion. Without any prolonged struggle, without repeated\r\noperations, which, if too numerous, might endanger the victim’s life,\r\nthe Hymenopteron has, if possible, to abolish all motive power at one\r\nblow. Therefore she must direct her dart at the nervous centres, the\r\nsource of the power of motion whence radiate the nerves running up to\r\nthe various organs of movement. Now these sources of locomotion, these\r\nnervous centres, consist of a certain number of ganglia, more numerous\r\nin the larva, less so in the perfect insect, and arranged on the median\r\nline of the under surface in a string of beads more or less distant and\r\nconnected by a double ribbon of nervous tissue. In all insects which\r\nhave reached the perfect state the ganglia called thoracic, i.e. those\r\nfurnishing nerves to wings and feet and governing their movements, are\r\nthree in number. Here are the points to be struck: if their action can\r\nbe in any way destroyed, the possibility of movement is destroyed also.\r\n\r\nTwo ways of reaching these motive centres offer themselves to the\r\nfeeble dart of the Hymenopteron; one, the joint between neck and\r\ncorslet; the other the spot where the latter joins the continuation of\r\nthe thorax, between the first and second pair of feet. The way through\r\nthe neck does not answer; it is too far from the ganglia, which lie\r\nnear the base of the feet which they animate. The blow must be dealt at\r\nthe other spot, and through that only. Thus would an academy decide\r\nwhere Claude Bernards illuminated the question by their profound\r\nscience. And it is precisely there, between the first and second pairs\r\nof feet on the median line of the under surface, that the Cerceris\r\nplunges her lancet. By what learned intelligence must she be inspired!\r\n\r\nTo choose as the spot in which to plant her sting the one vulnerable\r\npoint, the point which only a physiologist versed in the anatomy of\r\ninsects could determine beforehand is by no means enough; the\r\nHymenopteron has a far greater difficulty to overcome, and she\r\novercomes it with a mastery which fills one with amazement. We said\r\nthat the nervous centres controlling the organs of motion in an insect\r\nare three. These are more or less distant from each other, but\r\nsometimes, though rarely, near together. They possess a certain\r\nindependence of action, so that an injury to one does not cause, at all\r\nevents immediately, more than paralysis of members connected with it,\r\nwhile the other ganglia and their corresponding members are not\r\naffected by it. To reach these three sources of motion one after the\r\nother, the second farther off than the first, and the last farther\r\nstill, and by a single way, between the first and second pairs of feet,\r\nseems impossible for the sting, which is too short, and besides, so\r\ndifficult to aim well in such conditions. True, certain Coleoptera have\r\nthe three ganglia of the thorax almost touching, and others have the\r\ntwo last completely united, soldered, smelted together. It is also\r\nrecognised that in proportion as the different nervous centres combine\r\nand centralise, the characteristic functions of animality become more\r\nperfect, and also, alas, more vulnerable. Those Coleoptera with centres\r\nof motion so near that they touch or even gather into one mass, and so\r\nare made part of each other, would be instantly paralysed by one sting;\r\nor if several were needed, at all events the ganglia to be paralysed\r\nare all collected under the point of the dart.\r\n\r\nNow which are the Coleoptera so specially easy to paralyse? That is the\r\nquestion. The lofty science of a Claude Bernard, floating in the\r\nfundamental generalities of organisation and life, is no longer enough\r\nfor us; it is unable to inform and guide us in this entomological\r\nselection. I appeal to every physiologist under whose eye these lines\r\nmay fall. Without having recourse to his book-shelves, could he name\r\nthe Coleoptera where such a nervous centralisation is found, and even\r\nwith the help of his library, could he instantly lay his hand on the\r\ninformation wanted? The truth is, we are entering on the minute details\r\nof the specialist; the highway is quitted for a path known to few.\r\n\r\nI find the necessary documents in the fine work of M. E. Blanchard\r\n(Annales des Sciences Naturelles, 3me série, tome v.) on the nervous\r\nsystem of Coleoptera. There I find that this centralisation of nerve\r\npower belongs especially to the Scarabæus, but most of these are too\r\nlarge; the Cerceris could neither attack nor carry them away; besides,\r\nmany live in filth, where the cleanly Hymenopteron could not go to seek\r\nthem. Motive centres very close together are also found among the\r\nHisters, which live on impurity, amid the smell of decay, and again\r\nthat will not do; also in the Scolytus, which is too small, and finally\r\nin Buprestids and Weevils.\r\n\r\nWhat unexpected light amid the pristine obscurities of the problem!\r\nAmid the immense number of the Coleoptera which the Cerceris seem able\r\nto prey upon, two groups alone, Weevils and Buprestids, fulfil the\r\nindispensable conditions. They live far from decay and dung, which\r\nperhaps cause invincible repugnance in this dainty Cerceris; they are\r\nof most varied size, proportioned to that of their different captors,\r\nwhich may thus choose according to their convenience. They are far more\r\nvulnerable than all the others at the one point where the sting of the\r\nHymenopteron can penetrate successfully, for at that point, all easily\r\naccessible to the dart, crowd the motor centres of feet and wings. At\r\nthis point the three thoracic ganglia of Weevils lie very close, the\r\nhind two are contiguous. At that same spot in the Buprestids the second\r\nand third are welded in one large mass a little distance from the\r\nfirst. And as it is precisely Buprestids and Weevils which are hunted,\r\nto the absolute exclusion of all other game, by the eight species of\r\nCerceris, whose food stores of Coleoptera have been ascertained, a\r\ncertain internal likeness, namely, in centralisation of the nervous\r\nsystem must be the explanation why there are heaped in the dens of\r\nvarious Cerceris victims, outwardly so unlike.\r\n\r\nIn this choice, upon which even transcendent knowledge could not\r\nimprove, such an assembly of difficulties is splendidly resolved, that\r\none asks if one be not the dupe of some involuntary illusion, and if\r\npreconceived theories have not obscured the reality of facts, in short,\r\nwhether the pen has not described imaginary marvels. A scientific\r\nresult is only solidly established when confirmed by experiments\r\nrepeated in every possible way. Now let us submit to experimental proof\r\nthe physiological operation taught us by Cerceris tuberculata. If it be\r\npossible to obtain artificially what the Hymenopteron obtained by her\r\nsting, i.e. abolition of movement, and long preservation of the victim\r\nin a state of perfect freshness; if it be possible to bring about this\r\nwonder with the Coleoptera hunted by the Cerceris, or with those\r\npossessing a like nervous centralisation, while one fails with those\r\nwhose ganglia are far apart, one must admit, however exacting one may\r\nbe in the matter of proof, that the Hymenopteron possesses in the\r\nunconscious inspirations of instinct the resources of sublime science.\r\nLet us see then what experiment shows. The manner of operation is very\r\nsimple. With a needle, or, better still, with the point of a fine steel\r\npen, we must introduce a tiny drop of some corrosive liquid into the\r\nthoracic motive centres, pricking the insect slightly at the jointing\r\nof the prothorax behind the first pair of feet. The liquid which I use\r\nis ammonia, but it is evident that any other liquid whose action is\r\nequally strong would produce the same results. The metal pen being\r\ncharged with ammonia as it might be with a droplet of ink, I give the\r\nprick. The effects thus obtained differ enormously, according to\r\nwhether the experiment be made upon species with thoracic ganglia near\r\ntogether or upon those where these same ganglia are far apart. With\r\nregard to the first category, my experiments were made on Scarabæus, S.\r\nsacer and S. longicollis; on a bronze Buprestis; and on weevils,\r\nespecially that Cleonus hunted by the heroine of these observations. In\r\nthe second category I have experimented on Caraboidea, Carabus,\r\nProcrustes, Chlœnius, Sphodrus, Nebria; Longicornia, Saperda, and\r\nLamia; on Melasomes; Blaps, Scaurus, and Asida.\r\n\r\nAmong the Scarabæus class, the Buprestids, and the Weevils, the effect\r\nis instantaneous. Every movement stops suddenly, without any\r\nconvulsion, as soon as the fatal drop has touched the nerve centres.\r\nThe sting of the Cerceris does not produce prompter extinction. Nothing\r\ncan be more striking than this sudden immobility in a vigorous\r\nScarabæus sacer, but the likeness between the effects produced by the\r\ndart of the Cerceris and the steel pen charged with ammonia does not\r\nstop here. Scarabæids, Buprestids, and Weevils artificially stung, in\r\nspite of their complete immobility, preserve for three weeks, one\r\nmonth, or even two, the perfect flexibility of every joint and the\r\nnormal freshness of the interior organs. With them defecation takes\r\nplace on the first days as in the normal condition, and movement can be\r\nexcited by the Voltaic current. In a word, they behave exactly as do\r\nColeoptera sacrificed by the Cerceris. There is complete identity\r\nbetween the state into which she plunges her victims and that produced\r\nat will by injecting ammonia into the nerve centres of the thorax. Now,\r\nas it is impossible to attribute the perfect preservation of the insect\r\nduring so long a time to the drop injected, one must altogether reject\r\nthe notion of an antiseptic fluid, and grant that in spite of utter\r\nimmobility the creature is not really dead. A spark of life exists,\r\nkeeping the organs for some time in normal freshness, but dying out by\r\ndegrees and leaving them at last subject to corruption. Moreover, the\r\nammonia in some cases produces extinction of movement in the feet only,\r\nand then the deleterious action of the fluid having doubtless not\r\nextended far enough, the antennæ preserve some mobility, and one sees\r\nthat the creature, even a month after inoculation, draws them back\r\nquickly at the least touch—an evident proof that life has not\r\ncompletely abandoned the inert body. This movement is not rare with\r\nWeevils wounded by the Cerceris.\r\n\r\nInjection of ammonia always stops motion at once in Buprestids,\r\nWeevils, and Scarabæus, but it is not always possible to put the\r\ncreature into the state just described. If the wound be too deep, or\r\nthe little drop instilled be too strong, at the end of two or three\r\ndays the victim really dies, and after two or three days there is but a\r\ndecaying body. If, on the contrary, the prick be too slight, it\r\nrecovers the power of motion, at least partially, after being inanimate\r\nfor more or less time. The Cerceris herself may operate clumsily, just\r\nlike man, for I have seen this kind of resurrection in a victim struck\r\nby the dart of a Hymenopteron. Sphex flavipennis, whose history will\r\npresently occupy us, heaps in her dens young crickets struck by her\r\nvenomed lancet. From one of her holes I have taken three poor crickets\r\nwhose extreme flabbiness would, in any other circumstances, have\r\ndenoted death. But here, again, death was only apparent. Placed in a\r\nbottle, these crickets kept quite fresh but motionless for nearly three\r\nweeks, after which two grew mouldy, while the third came partly to\r\nlife—that is to say, it regained motion of the antennæ, mouth-parts,\r\nand, which is more remarkable, of the first two pairs of feet. If even\r\nthe skill of the Hymenopteron sometimes fails to benumb a victim for\r\ngood and all, can one expect constant success with the rough\r\nexperiments of man?\r\n\r\nIn Coleoptera of the second category—those where the ganglia of the\r\nthorax are distant one from another—the effect of ammonia is quite\r\ndifferent. Those which show themselves least vulnerable are the\r\nCaraboidea. A puncture which would instantly have annihilated motion in\r\nthe large Scarabæus sacer, in the middle size Caraboidea only causes\r\nviolent, disordered convulsions. By degrees the creature quiets down,\r\nand after some hours’ rest resumes its habitual movements as if nothing\r\nhad happened to it. If the experiment be repeated on it twice, thrice,\r\neven four times, the results are the same, until the wound becomes too\r\nserious, and it dies outright, as is proved by the drying up and\r\nputrefaction which soon follow.\r\n\r\nThe Melasomes and the Longicorns are more sensitive to the action of\r\nammonia. The injection of a small corrosive drop quickly renders them\r\nmotionless, and after some twitching they seem dead. But the paralysis\r\nwhich would have persisted in Weevils, Scarabids, and Buprestids is but\r\nmomentary. Before long motion reappears as energetic as before. It is\r\nonly when the dose of ammonia is of a certain strength that movement\r\ndoes not reappear. But then the creature is really dead, and\r\nputrefaction rapidly comes on. It is then impossible to cause complete\r\nand persistent paralysis in Coleoptera with ganglia far apart by the\r\nmeans so efficacious in those with ganglia near together. At the utmost\r\none can only obtain momentary paralysis, which passes quickly away. The\r\ndemonstration is decisive. Cerceris which prey on Coleoptera conform in\r\ntheir choice to what the most learned physiology and finest anatomy\r\nalone can teach. It would be vain to endeavour to see nothing here but\r\nchance agreement; it is not chance which explains such harmony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nTHE YELLOW-WINGED SPHEX\r\n\r\n\r\nIn their impenetrable coat of mail the Coleoptera offer but one\r\nvulnerable point to their dart-bearing foe. This defect in the cuirass\r\nis known to the assassin, and the poisoned sting is there inserted,\r\nstriking at one blow the three centres of motion, the Weevil and\r\nBuprestid, which alone have a nervous organisation sufficiently\r\ncentralised, being selected. But what happens when the insect wears no\r\narmour and is soft-skinned, so that the Hymenopteron can pierce it\r\nanywhere that the chances of the struggle may direct? Is there then a\r\nchoice as to where the blow is given? Like the assassin who strikes at\r\nthe heart to shorten the dangerous struggles of his victim, does the\r\nSphex follow the tactics of the Cerceris, and strike by preference at\r\nthe motor ganglia? If so, what happens when these are distant from one\r\nanother, acting so independently that paralysis of one does not affect\r\nthe others? These questions will be answered by the history of an\r\ninsect which hunts field crickets, Sphex flavipennis.\r\n\r\nIt is towards the end of July that this Sphex tears open the cocoon\r\nwhich until then has protected it, and flies away from its subterranean\r\ncradle. During the whole of August one constantly sees it seeking drops\r\nof honey on the spiny heads of Eryngium campestre, the commonest of\r\nsuch robust plants as brave the dog days. But this careless life is\r\nbrief, for in the earliest days of September the Sphex has begun the\r\nhard existence of miner and hunter. It is usually on some small flat\r\nspot on banks along a road that the dwelling is established, only there\r\nmust be two indispensable conditions—a sandy soil easy to work, and\r\nsun. Beyond this no precaution is taken to shelter the domicile against\r\nautumn rain and winter frost. A horizontal position, unsheltered,\r\nbeaten by rain and wind, suit the Sphex perfectly, so long as it is\r\nexposed to the sun. But when the work is half-way through, if heavy\r\nrain should come, it is sad to see next day galleries in course of\r\nconstruction choked with sand and finally abandoned.\r\n\r\nRarely does the Sphex work in solitude; it is in small bands of ten,\r\ntwenty, or more excavators that the claim selected is worked. One must\r\nhave spent some days watching one of these colonies in order to form\r\nany idea of the restless activity, the feverish haste, the abrupt\r\nmovements, of these hard-working miners. They rapidly attack the ground\r\nwith the rakes of their forefeet, canis instar, as Linnæus says. A\r\npuppy does not show more energy in scratching up the ground in play. At\r\nthe same time each labourer hums a joyous song—shrill, high-pitched,\r\ninterrupted at short intervals, and modulated by vibrations of wings\r\nand thorax. One would think they were a troop of merry comrades,\r\nstimulating one another to work by a cadenced rhythm. Meanwhile, the\r\nsand flies, falling in fine dust on their quivering wings, and the\r\nheavier gravel, pulled out bit by bit, rolls far away. If a bit resist\r\ntoo much, the insect goes at it with a high note, reminding one of the\r\ncry with which a woodcutter accompanies the stroke of his axe. Under\r\nthe redoubled efforts of tarsi and mandibles the cavity is already\r\nsketched out, and the Sphex can already dart into it. Then comes a\r\nlively interchange of forward movements to detach material, and of\r\nbackward to brush out fragments. In this hurried coming and going the\r\nSphex does not so much walk as dart forward, as though impelled by a\r\nspring. With panting abdomen, antennæ vibrating, the whole body moved\r\nby a strong thrill, she springs forward and is out of sight. You still\r\nhear the unwearied hum underground, and one sees from time to time hind\r\nlegs pushing backward a wave of sand to the mouth of the burrow. From\r\ntime to time labour underground is interrupted either that the Sphex\r\nmay dust herself in the sunlight, and get rid of grains of dust which\r\ninsinuate themselves into delicate joints and hamper the liberty of her\r\nmovements, or that she make a reconnaissance in the neighbourhood.\r\nNotwithstanding these short interruptions, in a few hours the gallery\r\nis hollowed out and the Sphex appears on her threshold, to voice her\r\ntriumph, and give the last touch to her labours by effacing some\r\ninequality, or carrying away some particles of earth, the objection to\r\nwhich only the eye of a Sphex could perceive.\r\n\r\nOf the many tribes of Sphegidæ visited by me, there is one of which I\r\nretain a specially lively recollection, on account of its singular\r\ninstallation upon the edge of a high road, where were little heaps of\r\nmud thrown up from side ditches by the cantonnier’s shovel. One, well\r\nsun-dried, had a conical shape like a sugar-loaf over fifteen inches\r\nhigh. The situation pleased the Sphegidæ, who had established a more\r\npopulous community than I have ever again met with. From base to summit\r\nthe cone of dried mud was pierced with burrows, giving it the\r\nappearance of a huge sponge. In every story was feverish animation, and\r\na busy coming and going which brought to mind the scene in some great\r\nworkshop when orders are pressing. Crickets were being dragged by the\r\nantennæ up the slopes of the conical city; there was storing of\r\nprovisions in the larders of the cells; dust was pouring from galleries\r\nin process of construction; at intervals the grimy faces of the miners\r\nappeared at mouths of passages—there was a constant going and coming.\r\nNow and then, in a short interval of leisure, a Sphex ascended the top\r\nof the cone, perhaps to take a general and well-satisfied view from\r\nthis belvedere. What a tempting sight!—one to make me long to carry\r\naway the entire city with its inhabitants. It was useless to try; the\r\nmass was too heavy. One cannot take up a village by the roots to plant\r\nit elsewhere.\r\n\r\nLet us look at the Sphex at work in flat ground, as is much more\r\nfrequently the case. As soon as the burrow is hollowed out, the chase\r\nbegins. Let us profit by the absence of the Hymenopteron in search of\r\ngame, and take a look at her dwelling. The spot chosen by a Sphex\r\ncolony is generally horizontal, though the ground is not so level but\r\nthat there are little mounds crowned by a tuft of grass or thrift, or\r\ninequalities consolidated by the slender roots of the vegetation which\r\ncovers them. It is on the sides of such furrows that the Sphex places\r\nher den. For two or three inches in depth the gallery is horizontal,\r\nserving as an approach to the hidden shelter for the provender and the\r\nlarvæ. In this vestibule the Sphex takes refuge in bad weather, rests\r\nthere at night, and occasionally by day for a few instants, showing\r\nonly her expressive face and impudent eyes. Beyond the vestibule an\r\nabrupt turn descends more or less obliquely to a depth of two or three\r\ninches more, ending in an oval cell rather larger in diameter, whose\r\naxis lies parallel with the horizontal gallery. The cell walls are not\r\ncovered with any particular cement, but in spite of their bareness they\r\nhave evidently been the object of most careful labour. The sand is\r\nheaped and levelled on the floor, on the ceiling, and sides, so as to\r\ndo away with the risk of landslips, or any roughness which might injure\r\nthe delicate skin of the larva. This cell communicates with the passage\r\nby a narrow entrance, just wide enough to allow the Sphex, burdened\r\nwith prey, to enter. When this first cell is furnished with an egg and\r\nnecessary provisions, the Sphex walls up the entrance, but does not yet\r\nabandon her burrow. A second cell is hollowed beside the first, and\r\nprovisioned in the same manner; there is then a third made, and\r\nsometimes a fourth. Only then does the Sphex cast back into the burrow\r\nthe rubbish heaped at the entrance, completely effacing all outward\r\ntrace of her work. Three cells are usually found in each burrow, rarely\r\ntwo, and yet more rarely four. As one learns by dissecting the insect,\r\none may estimate the number of eggs laid at about thirty, which would\r\nmake the number of burrows needed ten. Now these are hardly begun\r\nbefore September, and are finished before the end of the month.\r\nConsequently the Sphex cannot devote more than two or three days at\r\nmost to each burrow and its stores. Evidently the active little\r\ncreature has not a minute to lose, when in so short a time she has to\r\nhollow out the lair, procure a dozen crickets, sometimes brought from a\r\ndistance through endless difficulties, to store them, and finally to\r\nstop up the burrow. Moreover, there are days when wind makes hunting\r\nimpossible; rainy days or overcast ones suspending all work. The Sphex\r\ncannot give to her building the enduring solidity that Cerceris\r\ntuberculata gives to its deep galleries. This species transmit their\r\nsolid abodes from one generation to another, each year hollowed more\r\ndeeply, so that I was often bathed in perspiration when I tried to\r\nreach them, and frequently my efforts and my implements proved useless.\r\nThe Sphex inherits nothing, and must herself do everything, and that\r\nrapidly. Her dwelling is but a tent, hastily erected and moved on the\r\nmorrow. In compensation the larvæ, covered but by a thin layer of sand,\r\nknow how to supply the shelter which their mother has not given them;\r\nthey can clothe themselves with a double and triple waterproof\r\ncovering, far superior to the thin cocoon of the Cerceris.\r\n\r\nBut here comes a Sphex with noisy hum, returning from the chase. She\r\npauses on a neighbouring bush, holding in her mandibles one of the\r\nantennæ of a big cricket, weighing far more than herself. Tired out by\r\nthe weight, she rests a moment, then grasps her captive between her\r\nfeet, and with a supreme effort flies right across the ravine between\r\nher and her abode. She alights heavily on the flat ground where I am\r\nwatching, in the very middle of a Sphex village. The rest of the\r\njourney is made on foot, the Sphex, not in the least intimidated by my\r\npresence, comes astride her victim, holding her head proudly aloft\r\nwhile she drags along the cricket between her feet by one of its\r\nantennæ held in her jaws. If the soil be bare there is no difficulty,\r\nbut should a network of grass spread its runners across the way, it is\r\ncurious to see the astonishment of the Sphex at finding her efforts\r\nbaffled by this little obstacle—curious to witness her marches and\r\ncountermarches and repeated attempts until the difficulty is surmounted\r\neither by the aid of her wings or a well-planned détour. The cricket is\r\nat last conveyed to its destination and placed so that its antennæ come\r\nexactly to the mouth of the burrow. Then the Sphex abandons it and\r\ndescends in haste to the bottom of the cave. A few seconds later she\r\nputs her head out with a little cry of joy. The antennæ of the cricket\r\nare within reach; she seizes them and promptly conveys it down to her\r\nden.\r\n\r\nI still ask myself in vain why these complicated manœuvres at the\r\nmoment of conveying the cricket into the burrow. Why, instead of going\r\ndown alone and returning to resume the prey left on the threshold, does\r\nnot the Sphex drag it into the gallery, as she did in the open air,\r\nsince the space is wide enough, or take it with her while she enters\r\nbackwards? The various predatory Hymenoptera which I have been able to\r\nobserve all drag their prey at once to the bottom of their cells,\r\nholding it underneath them by their mandibles and intermediary feet.\r\nLéon Dufour’s Cerceris does indeed somewhat complicate her movements,\r\nsince after putting down her Buprestis for a moment at the door of her\r\nunderground abode, she instantly goes backward into the gallery, seizes\r\nher victim with her mandibles and drags it down; but that is very\r\nunlike the tactics adopted in a like case by the Sphex. Why this\r\ndomiciliary visit, which invariably precedes the introduction of the\r\nprey? May it not be that before descending hampered by a load, the\r\nSphex thinks it prudent to give a look round the bottom of her dwelling\r\nto make sure that all is in order and to drive out, if necessary, some\r\nimpertinent parasite which may have slipped in during her absence?\r\nSeveral Diptera, predatory flies, especially Tachinidæ, watch at the\r\ndoors of all the hunting Hymenoptera, spying out the favourable moment\r\nto lay their eggs on other people’s game, but none penetrate into the\r\ndwelling, nor venture into the dark passages, where, if by ill-luck the\r\nowner caught them, they might have to pay dearly for their audacity.\r\nThe Sphex, like others, pays her tribute to the predatory Tachinidæ,\r\nbut they never enter her burrow to commit their misdeeds. Besides, have\r\nthey not all the time they need to lay their eggs on the cricket? If\r\nthey look sharp, they may very well profit by the Sphex’s momentary\r\nabsence from her victim to confide their posterity to it. What yet\r\ngreater danger menaces the Sphex which renders this preliminary descent\r\nto the bottom of the burrow such an imperious necessity?\r\n\r\nThe one observed fact which can throw any light on the problem is this.\r\nAmid a colony of Sphegidæ in full activity, whence all other\r\nHymenoptera are habitually excluded, I one day surprised a sportsman of\r\na different kind, Tachytes nigra, carrying one by one, without any\r\nhaste and with the greatest composure, amid the crowd where he was but\r\nan intruder, grains of sand, little bits of dry stalk, and other small\r\nmaterials, to stop up a burrow of the same shape and size as the\r\nneighbouring ones of the Sphegidæ. This labour was pursued too\r\nconscientiously to admit of any doubt as to the presence of the\r\nworker’s egg in the underground dwelling. A Sphex with anxious\r\nmovements, apparently the legitimate owner of the burrow, never failed\r\neach time that the Tachytes entered the gallery to dart in pursuit, but\r\nemerged swiftly, as if frightened, followed by the other, who continued\r\nher task unmoved. I visited this burrow, the evident cause of strife\r\nbetween them, and found a cell provisioned with four crickets.\r\nSuspicion almost gave place to certainty, for this allowance far\r\nexceeded the needs of a Tachytes’ larva, which is at least one-half\r\nsmaller than the Sphex. The calm insect whose care to stop up the\r\nburrow at first suggested that it was the owner was really a usurper.\r\nHow comes it that the Sphex, larger and more robust than her adversary,\r\nallows herself to be robbed with impunity, limiting herself to a\r\nfruitless pursuit, and flying like a coward when the intruder, who\r\nseems not even to perceive her, turns round to come out of the burrow?\r\nIs it with insects as with men, the first quality needed for success is\r\naudacity—audacity—audacity? Certainly the usurper had no lack of it. I\r\ncan still see that Tachytes, imperturbably calm, going and coming\r\nbefore the meek Sphex, which stamped with impatience, but did not\r\nventure to fall upon the thief.\r\n\r\nLet us add that in other circumstances I have repeatedly found this\r\nHymenopteron, I suppose to be a parasite—this Tachytes nigra, dragging\r\na cricket by one of its antennæ. Was it a prey lawfully acquired? I\r\nwould fain think so, but the indecision of the insect which strayed\r\nabout the ruts in the paths as if seeking a convenient burrow always\r\nleft me suspicious. I have never been present when it burrowed, if\r\nindeed it ever does undertake that labour, and what is more, I have\r\nseen it abandon its game to decay, perhaps not knowing what to do with\r\nit for want of a hole where to put it. Such wastefulness seems to\r\nindicate goods ill-gotten, and I ask myself if the cricket were not\r\nstolen when the Sphex left it on her threshold? I also suspect Tachytes\r\nobsoleta, banded with white round the abdomen like Sphex albisecta,\r\nwhich nourishes its larvæ with crickets such as are hunted by the\r\nlatter. I have never seen it digging galleries, but I have caught it\r\ndragging crickets that the Sphex would not have disdained. This\r\nsimilarity of food in species of different genera makes me doubtful\r\nwhether the booty were lawfully come by. Let me add, however, to atone\r\nin some measure for the injury which my suspicions may do to the\r\ncharacter of the genus, that I have seen the perfectly lawful capture\r\nof a little cricket yet wingless by Tachytes tarsina, and have also\r\nseen it hollow cells and store them with prey bravely acquired. Thus I\r\nhave only suspicions to offer as to why the Sphex persists in\r\ndescending to the bottom of her hole before carrying in prey. Is there\r\nsome other end besides that of dislodging a parasite which may have got\r\nin during the owner’s absence? I despair of finding out; who can\r\ninterpret the thousand manœuvres of instinct? Poor human reason which\r\ncannot even explain the wisdom of a Sphex!\r\n\r\nAt all events, it is proved that these manœuvres are singularly\r\ninvariable, àpropos of which I will mention an experiment which greatly\r\ninterested me. At the moment when the Sphex makes her domiciliary\r\nvisit, I take the cricket and put it some way off. The Sphex comes up,\r\nutters her usual cry, looks round with astonishment, and seeing the\r\ngame too far off, comes out to seize and put it in the right position.\r\nThen she goes down again without the cricket. Same manœuvre on my part,\r\nsame disappointment when she reappears. Again the prey is brought to\r\nthe mouth of the hole, and again the Sphex goes down alone, and so on\r\nas long as my patience holds out. Forty times on end have I tried the\r\nexperiment on the same individual; her persistence vanquished mine, and\r\nher tactics never varied.\r\n\r\nHaving proved the inflexible pertinacity of all the Sphegidæ in one\r\ncolony on whom I cared to experiment, I could not but perplex myself\r\nover it. “Does then the insect obey a fixed tendency which\r\ncircumstances cannot modify?” I asked myself. “Are its actions all done\r\nby rule, and is it unable to acquire the least experience from its own\r\nproceedings?” Later observations modified this too absolute judgment.\r\n\r\nThe following year, at the proper time, I visited the same spot. The\r\nnew generation had inherited for their burrows the place chosen by the\r\npreceding ones; it had also faithfully inherited their tactics, for the\r\ncricket experiment gave the same results. Such as were the Sphegidæ of\r\nthe past year such are those of the present one, equally persistent in\r\na fruitless attempt. My error grew confirmed until good luck brought me\r\nto another colony in a different place. I renewed my experiments. After\r\ntwo or three trials with the old, well-known result, the Sphex got\r\nastride of the cricket, seized its antennæ with her mandibles, and\r\ndragged it at once into the burrow. Who looked a fool then? The\r\nexperimenter baffled by the clever Hymenopteron. At the other holes her\r\nneighbours, some sooner, some later, found me out, and went down with\r\ntheir prey instead of persisting in leaving it on the threshold to\r\nseize it later. What is the meaning of this? This colony, descended\r\nfrom another stock, for sons return to the spot selected by their\r\nforefathers, is cleverer than the one observed last year. Craft is\r\ninherited; there are sharper-witted tribes and duller ones, apparently\r\naccording to the faculties of their forefathers. With Sphegidæ, as with\r\nus, the kind of intellect changes with the province. Next day I tried\r\nthe cricket experiment in another locality, and it invariably\r\nsucceeded. I had come upon a dense-minded tribe, a true colony of\r\nBœotians, as in my earlier observations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nTHREE STROKES OF A DAGGER\r\n\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the Sphex uses her greatest skill when\r\nimmolating a cricket; it is therefore very important to explain the\r\nmethod by which the victim is sacrificed. Taught by my numerous\r\nattempts to observe the war tactics of the Cerceris, I immediately used\r\non the Sphex the plan already successful with the former, i.e. taking\r\naway the prey and replacing it by a living specimen. This exchange is\r\nall the easier because, as we have seen, the Sphex leaves her victim\r\nwhile she goes down her burrow, and the audacious tameness, which\r\nactually allows her to take from your fingertips, or even off your\r\nhand, the cricket stolen from her and now offered, conduces most\r\nhappily to a successful result of the experiment by allowing the\r\ndetails of the drama to be closely observed.\r\n\r\nIt is easy enough to find living crickets; one has only to lift the\r\nfirst stone, and you find them, crouched and sheltering from the sun.\r\nThese are the young ones of the current year, with only rudimentary\r\nwings, and which, not having the industry of the perfect insect, do not\r\nyet know how to dig deep retreats where they would be beyond the\r\ninvestigations of the Sphex. In a few moments I find as many crickets\r\nas I could wish, and all my preparations are made. I ascend to the top\r\nof my observatory, establish myself on the flat ground in the midst of\r\nthe Sphex colony and wait.\r\n\r\nA huntress comes, conveys her cricket to the mouth of her hole and goes\r\ndown alone. The cricket is speedily replaced by one of mine, but placed\r\nat some distance from the hole. The Sphex returns, looks round, and\r\nhurries to seize her too distant prey. I am all attention. Nothing on\r\nearth would induce me to give up my part in the drama which I am about\r\nto witness. The frightened cricket springs away. The Sphex follows\r\nclosely, reaches it, darts upon it. Then there is a struggle in the\r\ndust when sometimes conqueror, sometimes conquered is uppermost or\r\nundermost. Success, equal for a moment, finally crowns the aggressor.\r\nIn spite of vigorous kicks, in spite of bites from its pincer-like\r\njaws, the cricket is felled and stretched on its back.\r\n\r\nThe murderess soon makes her arrangements. She places herself body to\r\nbody with her adversary, but in a reverse position, seizes one of the\r\nbands at the end of the cricket’s abdomen and masters with her forefeet\r\nthe convulsive efforts of its great hind-thighs. At the same moment her\r\nintermediate feet squeeze the panting sides of the vanquished cricket,\r\nand her hind ones press like two levers on its face, causing the\r\narticulation of the neck to gape open. The Sphex then curves her\r\nabdomen vertically, so as to offer a convex surface impossible for the\r\nmandibles of the cricket to seize, and one beholds, not without\r\nemotion, the poisoned lancet plunge once into the victim’s neck, next\r\ninto the jointing of the two front segments of the thorax, and then\r\nagain towards the abdomen. In less time than it takes to tell, the\r\nmurder is committed, and the Sphex, after setting her disordered\r\ntoilette to rights, prepares to carry off her victim, its limbs still\r\nquivering in the death-throes. Let us reflect a moment on the admirable\r\ntactics of which I have given a faint sketch. The Cerceris attacks a\r\npassive adversary, incapable of flight, whose sole chance of safety is\r\nfound in a solid cuirass whose weak points the murderers know. But here\r\nwhat a difference! The prey is armed with redoubtable mandibles,\r\ncapable of disembowelling the aggressor if they can seize her, and a\r\npair of strong feet, actual clubs, furnished with a double row of sharp\r\nspines, which can be used alternatively to enable the cricket to bound\r\nfar away from an enemy or to overturn one by brutal kicks. Accordingly,\r\nnote what precautions on the part of the Sphex before using her dart.\r\nThe victim, lying on its back, cannot escape by using its hind levers,\r\nfor want of anything to spring from, as of course it would were it\r\nattacked in its normal position, as are the big Weevils by Cerceris\r\ntuberculata. Its spiny legs, mastered by the forefeet of the Sphex,\r\ncannot be used as offensive weapons, and its mandibles, held at a\r\ndistance by the hind-feet of the Hymenopteron, open threateningly but\r\ncan seize nothing. But it is not enough for the Sphex to render it\r\nimpossible for her victim to hurt her: she must hold it so firmly\r\ngarrotted that no movement can turn the sting from the points where the\r\ndrop of poison must be instilled, and probably it is in order to hinder\r\nany motion of the abdomen that one of the end segments is grasped. If a\r\nfertile imagination had had free play to invent a plan of attack it\r\ncould not have devised anything better, and it is questionable whether\r\nthe athletes of the classic palestra when grappling an adversary would\r\nhave assumed attitudes more scientifically calculated.\r\n\r\nI have just said that the dart is plunged several times into the\r\nvictim’s body, once under the neck, then behind the prothorax, lastly\r\nnear the top of the abdomen. It is in this triple blow that the\r\ninfallibility, the infused science of instinct, appear in all their\r\nmagnificence. First let us recall the chief conclusions to which the\r\npreceding study of the Cerceris have led us. The victims of Hymenoptera\r\nwhose larva live on prey are not corpses, in spite of entire\r\nimmobility. There is merely total or partial paralysis, and more or\r\nless annihilation of animal life, but vegetative life—that of the\r\nnutritive organs—lasts a long while yet, and preserves from\r\ndecomposition the prey which the larvæ are not to devour for a\r\nconsiderable time. To produce this paralysis the predatory Hymenoptera\r\nuse just those methods which the advanced science of our day might\r\nsuggest to the experimental physiologist—namely, wounding, by means of\r\na poisoned dart, those nervous centres which animate the organs of\r\nlocomotion. We know too that the various centres or ganglia of the\r\nnervous chain in articulate animals act to a certain degree\r\nindependently, so that injury to one only causes, at all events\r\nimmediately, paralysis of the corresponding segment, and this in\r\nproportion as the ganglia are more widely separated and distant from\r\neach other. If, on the contrary, they are soldered together, injury to\r\nthe common centre causes paralysis of all the segments where its\r\nramifications spread. This is the case with Buprestids and Weevils,\r\nwhich the Cerceris paralyses by a single sting, directed at the common\r\nmass of the nerve centres in the thorax. But open a cricket, and what\r\ndo we find to animate the three pairs of feet? We find what the Sphex\r\nknew long before the anatomist, three nerve centres far apart. Thence\r\nthe fine logic of the three stabs. Proud science! humble thyself.\r\n\r\nCrickets sacrificed by Sphex flavipennis are no more dead, in spite of\r\nall appearances, than are Weevils struck by a Cerceris. The flexibility\r\nof the integuments displays the slightest internal movement, and thus\r\nmakes useless the artificial means used by me to show some remains of\r\nlife in the Cleonus of Cerceris tuberculata. If one closely observes a\r\ncricket stretched on its back a week or even a fortnight or more after\r\nthe murder, one sees the abdomen heave strongly at long intervals. Very\r\noften one can notice a quiver of the palpi and marked movements in the\r\nantennæ and the bands of the abdomen, which separate and then come\r\nsuddenly together. By putting such crickets into glass tubes I have\r\nkept them perfectly fresh for six weeks. Consequently, the Sphex larvæ,\r\nwhich live less than a fortnight before enclosing themselves in their\r\ncocoons, are sure of fresh food as long as they care to feast.\r\n\r\nThe chase is over; the three or four crickets needed to store a cell\r\nare heaped methodically on their backs, their heads at the far end,\r\ntheir feet toward the entrance. An egg is laid on each. Then the burrow\r\nhas to be closed. The sand from the excavation lying heaped before the\r\ncell door is promptly swept out backward into the passage. From time to\r\ntime fair-sized bits of gravel are chosen singly, the Sphex scratching\r\nin the fragments with her forefeet, and carrying them in her jaws to\r\nconsolidate the pulverised mass. If none suitable are at hand, she goes\r\nto look for them in the neighbourhood, apparently choosing with such\r\nscrupulous care as a mason would show in selecting the best stones for\r\na building. Vegetable remains and tiny bits of dead leaf are also\r\nemployed. In a moment every outward sign of the subterranean dwelling\r\nis gone, and if one has not been careful to mark its position, it is\r\nimpossible for the most attentive eye to find it again. This done, a\r\nnew burrow is made, provisioned and walled up as soon as the Sphex has\r\neggs to house. Having finished laying, she returns to a careless and\r\nvagabond life until the first cold weather ends her well-filled\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nThe Sphex’s task is accomplished. I will finish mine by an examination\r\nof her weapon. The organ destined for the elaboration of her poison is\r\ncomposed of two elegantly branched tubes communicating separately with\r\na common reservoir or pear-shaped vial, whence proceeds a slender\r\nchannel leading to the axis of the sting and conducting to its end the\r\nlittle poisoned drop. The dart is extremely small, and not such as one\r\nwould expect from the size of the Sphex, especially from the effect\r\nwhich her sting produces on crickets. The point is quite smooth,\r\nwithout the barbs found in the sting of the hive bee. The reason of\r\nthis is evident. The bee uses her sting to avenge an injury only at the\r\ncost of life, the barbs preventing its withdrawal from the wound, and\r\nthus causing mortal ruptures in the viscera at the end of the abdomen.\r\nWhat could the Sphex have done with a weapon which would have been\r\nfatal the first time it was used? Even supposing that the barbed dart\r\ncould have been withdrawn, I doubt if any Hymenopteron using its\r\nweapon, especially to wound game destined for its progeny, would be\r\nprovided with one. For here the dart is not a fine gentleman’s weapon,\r\nunsheathed for vengeance, which is said to be the pleasure of the gods,\r\nbut a very costly one, since the vindictive bee sometimes pays for it\r\nwith life. It is a worker’s tool, on which depends the future of the\r\nlarvæ, thus it should be one easily used in a struggle with captured\r\nprey, plunging into and coming out of the flesh without any delay—a\r\ncondition much better fulfilled by a smooth blade than by a barbed one.\r\n\r\nI wished to ascertain at my own expense if the Sphex’s sting be very\r\npainful—that sting which knocks over robust victims with frightful\r\nrapidity. Well, I own with great admiration that it is slight and\r\ncannot be at all compared as to pain with those of the bee and the\r\nirascible wasp. It hurts so little that, instead of using pincers, I\r\nnever hesitated to catch with my fingers any Sphegidæ which I wanted\r\nfor my researches. I may say the same of the various Cerceris,\r\nPhilanthides, Palares, and even of the huge Scoliides, whose very look\r\nis terrifying, and in general of all predatory Hymenoptera which I have\r\nbeen able to observe. I except, however, those that hunt spiders, the\r\nPompili, and even their sting is far less severe than that of a bee.\r\n\r\nOne last remark. We know how furiously Hymenoptera armed with a sting\r\nused only for defence rush at the bold man who disturbs their nest, and\r\npunish his temerity. Those on the contrary whose sting is used only for\r\nhunting are very pacific, as if they guessed how important for their\r\nfamily is the little poison drop in their vase. That droplet is the\r\nsafeguard of their race—I might really say their means of subsistence;\r\ntherefore they use it economically, in the serious business of the\r\nchase, with no parade of vengeful courage. I was not once punished by a\r\nsting when I established myself amid colonies of our various predatory\r\nHymenoptera, whose nests I overturned, carrying off larvæ and\r\nprovisions. To induce the creature to use its weapon, one must lay hold\r\nof it, and even then the skin is not always pierced, unless one puts\r\nwithin reach a part more delicate than the fingers, such as the wrist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nLARVA AND NYMPH\r\n\r\n\r\nThe egg of Sphex flavipennis is white, elongated, and cylindrical,\r\nslightly curved, and measuring three to four millimetres in length.\r\nInstead of being laid fortuitously on any part of the victim, it is\r\ninvariably placed on one spot, across the cricket’s breast—a little on\r\none side, between the first and second pairs of feet. The eggs of the\r\nwhite bordered, and of the Languedocian Sphex occupy a like\r\nposition—the first on the breast of a cricket, the second on that of an\r\nephippiger. This chosen spot must possess some highly important\r\npeculiarity for the security of the young larva, as I have never known\r\nit vary.\r\n\r\nHatching takes place at the end of two or three days. A most delicate\r\ncovering splits, and one sees a feeble maggot, transparent as crystal,\r\nsomewhat attenuated and even compressed in front, slightly swelled out\r\nbehind, and adorned on either side by a narrow white band formed by the\r\nchief trachea. The feeble creature occupies the same position as the\r\negg; its head is, as it were, engrafted on the same spot where the\r\nfront end of the egg was fixed, and the remainder of its body rests on\r\nthe victim without adhering to it. Its transparency allows us readily\r\nto perceive rapid fluctuations within its body, undulations following\r\none another with mathematical regularity, and which, beginning in the\r\nmiddle of the body, are impelled, some forward and some backward. These\r\nare due to the digestive canal, which imbibes long draughts of the\r\njuices drawn from the sides of the victim.\r\n\r\nLet us pause a moment before a spectacle so calculated to arrest\r\nattention. The prey is laid on its back, motionless. In the cell of\r\nSphex flavipennis it is a cricket, or three or four, piled up; in that\r\nof the Languedocian Sphex there is a single victim, but proportionately\r\nlarge, a plump-bodied ephippiger. The grub is a lost grub if torn from\r\nthe spot whence it draws nourishment. Should it fall, all is over, for\r\nweak as it is, and without means of locomotion, how would it again find\r\nthe spot where it should quench its thirst? The merest trifle would\r\nenable the victim to get rid of the animalcule gnawing at its entrails,\r\nyet the gigantic prey gives itself up without the least sign of\r\nprotestation. I am well aware that it is paralysed, and has lost the\r\nuse of its feet from the sting of its assassin, but at this early stage\r\nit preserves more or less power of movement and sensation in parts\r\nunaffected by the dart. The abdomen palpitates, the mandibles open and\r\nshut, the abdominal styles and the antennæ oscillate. What would happen\r\nif the grub fixed on one of the spots yet sensitive near the mandibles,\r\nor even on the stomach, which, being tenderer and more succulent, would\r\nnaturally suggest itself as fittest for the first mouthfuls of the\r\nfeeble grub? Bitten on the quick parts, cicada, cricket, and ephippiger\r\nwould display at least some shuddering of the skin, which would detach\r\nand throw off the minute larva, for which probably all would be over,\r\nsince it would risk falling into the formidable, pincer-like jaws.\r\n\r\nBut there is a part of the body where no such peril is to be feared—the\r\nthorax wounded by the sting. There and there only can the experimenter\r\non a recent victim dig down the point of a needle—nay, pierce through\r\nand through without evoking any sign of pain. And there the egg is\r\ninvariably laid—there the young larva always attacks its prey. Gnawed\r\nwhere pain is no longer felt, the cricket does not stir. Later, when\r\nthe wound has reached a sensitive spot, it will move of course as much\r\nas it can; but then it is too late—its torpor will be too deep, and\r\nbesides, its enemy will have gained strength. That is why the egg is\r\nalways laid on the same spot, near the wounds caused by the sting on\r\nthe thorax, not in the middle, where the skin might be too thick for\r\nthe new-born grub, but on one side—toward the junction of the feet,\r\nwhere the skin is much thinner. What a judicious choice! what reasoning\r\non the part of the mother when, underground, in complete darkness, she\r\nperceives and utilises the one suitable spot for her egg!\r\n\r\nI have brought up Sphex larvæ by giving them successively crickets\r\ntaken from cells, and have thus been able, day by day, to follow the\r\nrapid progress of my nurslings. The first cricket—that on which the egg\r\nis laid—is attacked, as I have already said, toward the point where the\r\ndart first struck—between the first and second pairs of legs. At the\r\nend of a few days the young larva has hollowed a hole big enough for\r\nhalf its body in the victim’s breast. One may then sometimes see the\r\ncricket, bitten to the quick, vainly move its antennæ and abdominal\r\nstyles, open and close its empty jaws, and even move a foot, but the\r\nlarva is safe and searches its vitals with impunity. What an awful\r\nnightmare for the paralysed cricket! This first ration is consumed in\r\nsix or seven days; nothing is left but the outer integument, whose\r\nevery portion remains in place. The larva, whose length is then twelve\r\nmillimetres, comes out of the body of the cricket through the hole it\r\nhad made in the thorax. During this operation it moults, and the skin\r\nremains caught in the opening. It rests, and then begins on a second\r\nration. Being stronger it has nothing to fear from the feeble movements\r\nof the cricket, whose daily increasing torpor has extinguished the last\r\nshred of resistance, more than a week having passed since it was\r\nwounded; so it is attacked with no precautions, and usually at the\r\nstomach, where the juices are richest. Soon comes the turn of the third\r\ncricket, then that of the fourth, which is consumed in ten hours. Of\r\nthese three victims there remains only the horny integument, whose\r\nvarious portions are dismembered one by one and carefully emptied. If a\r\nfifth ration be offered, the larva disdains or hardly touches it, not\r\nfrom moderation, but from an imperious necessity.\r\n\r\nIt should be observed that up to now the larva has ejected no\r\nexcrement, and that its intestine, in which four crickets have been\r\nengulfed, is distended to bursting. Thus, a new ration cannot tempt its\r\ngluttony, and henceforward it only thinks about making a silken\r\ndwelling. Its repast has lasted from ten to twelve days without a\r\npause. Its length now measures from twenty-five to thirty millimetres,\r\nand its greatest width from five to six. Its usual shape, somewhat\r\nenlarged behind and narrowed in front, agrees with that general in\r\nlarvæ of Hymenoptera. It has fourteen segments, including the head,\r\nwhich is very small, with weak mandibles seemingly incapable of the\r\npart just played by them. Of these fourteen segments the intermediary\r\nones are provided with stigmata. Its livery is yellowish-white, with\r\ncountless chalky white dots.\r\n\r\nWe saw that the larva began on the stomach of the second cricket, this\r\nbeing the most juicy and fattest part. Like a child who first licks off\r\nthe jam on his bread, and then bites the slice with contemptuous tooth,\r\nit goes straight to what is best, the abdominal intestines, leaving the\r\nflesh, which must be extracted from its horny sheath, until it can be\r\ndigested deliberately. But when first hatched it is not thus dainty: it\r\nmust take the bread first and the jam later, and it has no choice but\r\nto bite its first mouthful from the middle of the victim’s chest,\r\nexactly where its mother placed the egg. It is rather tougher, but the\r\nspot is a secure one, on account of the deep inertia into which three\r\nstabs have thrown the thorax. Elsewhere, there would be, generally, if\r\nnot always, spasmodic convulsions which would detach the feeble thing\r\nand expose it to terrible risks amid a heap of victims whose hind legs,\r\ntoothed like a saw, might occasionally kick, and whose jaws could still\r\ngrip. Thus it is motives of security, and not the habits of the grub,\r\nwhich determine the mother where to place its egg.\r\n\r\nA suspicion suggests itself to me as to this. The first cricket, the\r\nration on which the egg is laid, exposes the grub to more risks than do\r\nthe others. First, the larva is still a weakly creature; next, the\r\nvictim was only recently stung, and therefore in the likeliest state\r\nfor displaying some remains of life. This first cricket has to be as\r\nthoroughly paralysed as possible, and therefore it is stabbed three\r\ntimes. But the others, whose torpor deepens as time passes,—the others\r\nwhich the larvæ only attack when grown strong,—have they to be treated\r\nas carefully? Might not a single stab, or two, suffice to bring on a\r\ngradual paralysis while the grub devours its first allowance? The\r\npoison is too precious to be squandered; it is powder and shot for the\r\nSphex, only to be used economically. At all events, if at one time I\r\nhave been able to see a victim stabbed thrice, at another I have only\r\nseen two wounds given. It is true that the quivering point of the\r\nSphex’s abdomen seemed seeking a favourable spot for a third wound; but\r\nif really given, it escaped my observation. I incline to believe that\r\nthe victim destined to be eaten first always is stabbed three times,\r\nbut that economy causes the others only to be struck twice. The study\r\nof the caterpillar-hunting Ammophila will later confirm this suspicion.\r\n\r\nThe last cricket being finished, the larva sets to work to spin a\r\ncocoon. In less than forty-eight hours the work is completed, and\r\nhenceforward the skilful worker may yield within an impenetrable\r\nshelter to the overpowering lethargy which is stealing over it—a state\r\nof being which is neither sleeping nor waking, death nor life, whence\r\nit will issue transfigured ten months later. Few cocoons are so complex\r\nas is this one. Besides a coarse outer network, there are three\r\ndistinct layers, forming three cocoons, one within another. Let us\r\nexamine in detail these various courses of the silken edifice. First\r\ncomes an open network, coarse and cobwebby, on which the larva places\r\nitself and hangs as in a hammock to work more easily at the cocoon\r\nproperly so called. This incomplete net, hastily spun to serve as a\r\nscaffolding, is made with threads carelessly placed and holding grains\r\nof sand, bits of earth, and remains from the larva’s banquet—cricket’s\r\nthighs, still banded with red, feet, and skull. The next covering,\r\nwhich is the first of the real cocoon, is a felted wrapper, light red,\r\nvery fine, very supple, and somewhat crumpled. A few threads cast here\r\nand there connect it with the preceding scaffolding and the following\r\ncovering. It forms a cylindrical purse, with no opening and too large\r\nfor what it contains, thus causing the surface to wrinkle. Then comes\r\nan elastic case, markedly smaller than the purse which contains it,\r\nalmost cylindrical, and rounded at the upper end, toward which is\r\nturned the head of the larva, while at the lower it makes a blunt cone.\r\nIts colour is light red, except towards the lower end, where the shade\r\nis darker. It is fairly firm, though it yields to a moderate pressure,\r\nexcept in the conical part, which resists and seems to contain a hard\r\nsubstance. On opening this sheath it is seen to be formed of two layers\r\nclosely pressed together, but easily separable. The outer is a silken\r\nfelt precisely like that of the preceding purse, the inner one, the\r\nthird of the cocoon, is a kind of lacquer—a brilliant violet-brown\r\nvarnish, fragile, very soft to the touch, and of quite a different\r\nnature to the rest of the cocoon. The microscope shows that instead of\r\nbeing a felt of silky filaments like the other coverings, it is a\r\nhomogeneous covering of a peculiar varnish, whose origin is, as we\r\nshall see, sufficiently strange. As for the resistance of the conical\r\nend of the cocoon, one finds it caused by a load of friable matter,\r\ndark violet, and shining with numerous black particles. This load is\r\nthe dry mass of excrement, ejected once for all by the larva, inside\r\nits cocoon, and to it is due the darker colour of the conical end. The\r\naverage length of this complex dwelling is twenty-seven millimetres,\r\nand its greatest width nine.\r\n\r\nLet us return to the purple varnish which covers the interior of the\r\ncocoon. At first, I thought it should be attributed to the silk glands,\r\nwhich, after serving to spin the double wrapper of silk and the\r\nscaffolding, must finally have secreted it. To convince myself, I\r\nopened larvæ which had just completed their task of weaving, and had\r\nnot yet begun to lay on the lacquer. At that period I found no trace of\r\nviolet fluid in their glands. It is only seen in the digestive canal,\r\nwhich is swelled with a purple pulp, and later in the stercorous load\r\nsent down to the lower end of the cocoon. Elsewhere all is white, or\r\nfaintly tinged with yellow. I am far from suggesting that the larva\r\nplasters its cocoon with excrement, yet I am convinced that this wash\r\nis produced by the digestive organs, and I suspect—though I cannot\r\npositively assert it, having several times missed the moment to\r\nascertain it—that the larva disgorges and applies with its mouth the\r\nquintessence of the purple pulp in its stomach to make the wash of\r\nlacquer. Only after this last piece of work would it eject the remains\r\nof digestion in a single mass, and thus is explained the disgusting\r\nnecessity of storing the excrement within the larva’s habitation.\r\n\r\nAt all events the usefulness of this layer is clear; its absolute\r\nimpermeability protects the larva from the damp which would certainly\r\npenetrate the poor shelter hollowed for it by its mother. Recollect\r\nthat it is buried but a few inches deep in sandy, open ground. To judge\r\nhow far cocoons thus varnished are capable of resisting damp, I have\r\nplunged them in water for several days, yet never found any trace of\r\nmoisture within them. Let us compare the Sphex cocoon, with manifold\r\ncoverings to protect the larva in a burrow itself unprotected, with\r\nthat of Cerceris tuberculata, sheltered by a layer of sandstone, more\r\nthan half a yard down in the ground. This cocoon has the form of a very\r\nlong pear, with the small end cut off. It is composed of a single\r\nsilken wrap, so fine that the larva is seen through it. In my many\r\nentomological researches I have always found the labour of larva and\r\nmother supplement each other. In a deep well-sheltered dwelling the\r\ncocoon is of light materials; for a surface abode, exposed to wind and\r\nweather, it is strongly constructed.\r\n\r\nNine months pass, during which a work is done which is quite hidden. I\r\npass over this period, occupied by the unknown mystery of\r\ntransformation, and to come to the nymph, go from the end of September\r\nto the first days of the following July. The larva has thrown aside its\r\nfaded vestment, and the chrysalis, a transitory organisation, or\r\nrather, a perfect insect in swaddling bands, awaits motionless the\r\nawakening which is still a month off. Feet, antennæ, the visible\r\nportions of the mouth, and the undeveloped wings, look like clearest\r\ncrystal, and are regularly spread out under the thorax and abdomen. The\r\nrest of the body is of an opaque white, slightly tinged with yellow;\r\nthe four intermediary segments of the abdomen show on either side a\r\nnarrow, blunt prolongation; the last segment has above a blade-like\r\ntermination, shaped like the section of a circle, furnished below with\r\ntwo conical protuberances, side by side, thus making in all eleven\r\nappendages starring the contour of the abdomen. Such is the delicate\r\ncreature which, to become a Sphex, must assume a particoloured livery\r\nof black and red, and throw off the fine skin which swaddles it so\r\nclosely.\r\n\r\nI have been curious to follow day by day the progress and coloration of\r\nthe chrysalid, and to experiment whether sunlight—that rich palette\r\nwhence Nature draws her colours—could influence their progress. With\r\nthis aim I have taken chrysalids out of their cocoon and kept them in\r\nglass tubes, where some, in complete darkness, realised natural\r\nconditions, while others, hung up against a white wall, were all day\r\nlong in a strong light. These diametrically opposed conditions did not\r\naffect the colouring, or if there were some slight difference, it was\r\nto the disadvantage of those exposed to light. Quite unlike to what\r\noccurs with plants, light does not influence insect-colouring, nor even\r\nquicken it. It must be so, since in the species most gifted with\r\nsplendid colour—Buprestids and Carabids for instance—the wonderful hues\r\nthat would seem stolen from a sunbeam are really elaborated in\r\ndarkness, deep in the ground, or in the decayed trunk of some aged\r\ntree.\r\n\r\nThe first indication of colour is in the eyes, whose horny facets pass\r\nsuccessively from white to tawny, then to a slaty hue, and lastly to\r\nblack. The simple ones at the top of the forehead share in their turn\r\nin this coloration before the rest of the body has at all lost its\r\nwhitish tint. It should be noted that this precocity in the most\r\ndelicate of organs, the eye, is general in animals. Later a smoky line\r\nappears in the furrow separating the mesothorax from the metathorax,\r\nand four-and-twenty hours later the whole back of the mesothorax is\r\nblack. At the same time the division of the prothorax grows shaded, a\r\nblack dot appears in the central and upper part of the metathorax, and\r\nthe mandibles are covered with a rusty tint. Gradually a deeper and\r\ndeeper shade spreads over the last segments of the thorax, and finally\r\nreaches the head and sides. One day suffices to turn the smoky tint of\r\nthe head and the furthest segments of the thorax into deep black. Then\r\nthe abdomen shares in the rapidly increasing coloration. The edge of\r\nthe anterior segments is tinted with daffodil, while the posterior\r\nsegments acquire a band of ashy black. Then the antennæ and feet take a\r\ndarker and darker tint, till they become black, all the base of the\r\nabdomen turns orange-red, and the tip black. The livery would then be\r\ncomplete, but that the tarsi and mouthpieces are transparent red and\r\nthe stumps of wings ashy black. Four-and-twenty hours later the\r\nchrysalis will burst its bonds. It only takes six or seven days to\r\nacquire its permanent tints; the eyes have done so a fortnight before\r\nthe rest of the body. From this sketch the law of chromatic evolution\r\nis easily apprehended. We see that, omitting the eyes and ocelli, whose\r\nearly perfection recalls what takes place in the higher animals, the\r\nstarting-point of coloration is a central one, the mesothorax, whence\r\nit invades progressively by centrifugal progression—first the rest of\r\nthe thorax, then the head and abdomen, and finally the various\r\nappendages, antennæ, and feet. The tarsi and mouthpieces take colour\r\nlater still, and the wings only on coming out of their cases.\r\n\r\nNow we have the Sphex in full costume, but she still has to free\r\nherself from the chrysalis case. This is a very fine wrap, enfolding\r\nevery smallest detail of structure, and hardly veiling the shape and\r\ncolours of the perfect insect. As prelude to the last act of\r\nmetamorphosis, the Sphex, rousing suddenly from her torpor, begins to\r\nshake herself violently, as if to call life into her long-benumbed\r\nlimbs. The abdomen is alternately lengthened and contracted, the feet\r\nare suddenly spread, then bent, then spread again, and their various\r\njoints are stiffened with effort. The creature, curved backwards on its\r\nhead and the point of the abdomen, with ventral surface upward,\r\ndistends by vigorous shakes the jointing of its neck and of the petiole\r\nattaching the abdomen to the thorax. At last its efforts are crowned\r\nwith success, and after half an hour of these rough gymnastics the\r\nsheath, pulled in every direction, ruptures at the neck, at the\r\ninsertion of the feet and petiole, and, in short, wherever the body has\r\nbeen movable enough to allow of sufficiently violent displacement.\r\n\r\nAll these tears leave several irregular strips, the chief of which\r\nenvelops the abdomen and comes up the back of the thorax. To it belong\r\nthe wing sheaths. A second strip covers the head. Lastly, each foot has\r\nits own sheath, more or less dilapidated toward the base. The biggest,\r\nwhich forms the chief part of the whole covering, is got off by\r\nalternate dilatations and contractions of the abdomen, which gradually\r\npush it back into a little ball connected for some time with the animal\r\nby tracheal filaments. Then the Sphex again becomes motionless, and the\r\noperation is over, though head, antennæ, and feet are still more or\r\nless covered. It is clear that the feet cannot be freed in one piece on\r\naccount of the roughnesses and thorns with which they are armed. These\r\nrags of skin dry up and are got rid of later by rubbing the feet\r\ntogether, and by brushing, smoothing, and combing the whole body with\r\nthe tarsi when the Sphex has acquired full vigour.\r\n\r\nThe way in which the wings come out of their sheaths is the most\r\nremarkable feature in this casting of the skin. In their undeveloped\r\nstate they are folded lengthways and much contracted. A little while\r\nbefore they acquire their normal appearance one can easily draw them\r\nout of their sheaths; but then they do not expand, remaining always\r\ncrumpled, while, when the large piece of which the sheaths are a part\r\nis pushed back by the movements of the abdomen, they may be seen\r\nissuing gradually from the sheaths, and immediately they gain freedom,\r\nassuming dimensions out of all proportion to the narrow prison from\r\nwhich they emerge. They are then the seat of an abundant influx of\r\nvital juices which swell and spread them out, and the turgescence thus\r\ninduced must be the chief cause of their coming out of their sheaths.\r\nWhen freshly expanded the wings are heavy, full of moisture, and of a\r\nvery light straw colour. If the influx should take place in an\r\nirregular manner, the point of the wing is seen to be weighed down by a\r\nyellow droplet contained between its under and upper surface.\r\n\r\nAfter denuding itself of the abdominal sheath, which draws away with it\r\nthe wing-cases, the Sphex again is motionless for about three days.\r\nDuring this interval the wings assume their normal colouring, the tarsi\r\ntake colour also, and the mouth-parts, at first spread out, assume\r\ntheir normal position. After twenty-four days as a nymph the insect\r\nattains its perfect state, tears its imprisoning cocoon, opens a way\r\nthrough the sand, and appears one fine morning in the light as yet\r\nunknown to it. Bathed in sunshine, it brushes wings and antennæ, passes\r\nits feet again and again over its abdomen, washes its eyes with its\r\nforefeet moistened with saliva, like a cat, and, its toilette made,\r\nflies joyfully away. Two months of life are before it.\r\n\r\nBeauteous Sphegidæ, hatched under my eyes and brought up by my hand,\r\nration by ration, on a bed of sand, at the bottom of an old feather\r\nbox,—you whose transformations I have followed step by step, waking up\r\nwith a start at night for fear of missing the moment when the nymph\r\nbreaks through her swaddling bands and the wings issue from their\r\ncases. You have taught me so many things, learning nothing yourselves,\r\nknowing without teachers all that you need to know. Oh, my beautiful\r\nSphegidæ! fly away without fear of my tubes, my phials, and all my\r\nboxes and cages, and all my prisons for you; fly through the warm\r\nsunshine, beloved by the cicadas! Go, and beware of the Praying Mantis,\r\nwho meditates your destruction on the purple thistles; beware of the\r\nlizard watching for you on the sunny slopes. Depart in peace, hollow\r\nout your burrows, stab your crickets scientifically, and continue your\r\nrace, so as to afford to others what you have afforded to me—some of\r\nthe few moments of happiness in my life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nADVANCED THEORIES\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are many species of Sphex, but for the most part strangers to our\r\ncountry. As far as I know, the French fauna contains but three—all\r\nlovers of the hot sun in the olive region—namely, Sphex flavipennis, S.\r\nalbisecta, and S. occitanica. It is not without keen interest that an\r\nobserver notices in all three of these predatory insects a choice of\r\nprovender in conformity with the strict laws of entomological\r\nclassification. To nourish their larvæ each confines itself to\r\nOrthoptera. The first hunts grasshoppers, the second crickets, and the\r\nthird ephippigers.\r\n\r\nThese prey are so different outwardly that to associate them and seize\r\ntheir analogies, either the practised eye of the entomologist, or the\r\nnot less expert one of the Sphex is needed. Compare the grasshopper\r\nwith the cricket: the former has a round, stumpy head; it is short and\r\nthickset, quite black, with red stripes on its hind thighs; the latter\r\nis grayish and slim, with a small conical head, springing suddenly by\r\nunbending its long hind legs, and carrying on this spring with fanlike\r\nwings. Now compare both with the ephippiger, who carries his musical\r\ninstrument on his back, two harshly toned cymbals, shaped like hollow\r\nscales, and who drags his obese body heavily along, ringed with pale\r\ngreen and butter colour, and ending in a long dagger. Place these three\r\nspecies side by side, and own with me that to be able to choose\r\ncreatures so unlike, and yet keep to the same entomological order, the\r\nSphex must have such an eye as not only a fairly observant person, but\r\na practised entomologist would not be ashamed of.\r\n\r\nIn the presence of these singular predilections, which seem to have\r\nlimits laid down by some master of classification,—a Latreille for\r\ninstance—it becomes interesting to inquire if foreign Sphegidæ hunt\r\ngame of the same order. Unfortunately information as to this is scanty\r\nor absolutely nil as regards most species. This regrettable lack is\r\nchiefly caused by the superficial method generally adopted. An insect\r\nis caught, transfixed with a long pin, fastened in a box with a cork\r\nbottom; a ticket with a Latin name is put under its feet, and all is\r\nsaid. This way of looking at entomological history does not satisfy me.\r\nIt is useless to tell me that such a species has so many joints in its\r\nantennæ, so many nerves in its wings, so many hairs on a part of the\r\nabdomen or thorax; I do not really know the creature until I have\r\nlearned its manner of life, its instincts and habits. And observe what\r\na luminous superiority has a description of the latter kind, given in\r\ntwo or three words over long descriptions, sometimes so hard to\r\nunderstand. Let us suppose that you want to introduce Sphex occitanica\r\nto me; you describe the number and arrangement of the wing nerves, and\r\nyou speak of cubital and recurrent nerves; next follows the written\r\ndescription of the insect. Here it is black, there rusty red, smoky\r\nbrown at the wing tips, at such a spot it is black velvet, at another\r\nsilvery down, and at a third smooth. It is all very precise, very\r\nminute—one must grant that much justice to the clear-sighted patience\r\nof him who describes; but it is very long, and besides, not always easy\r\nto follow, to such a degree that one may be excused for being sometimes\r\na little bewildered, even when not altogether a novice. But add to the\r\ntedious description just this—hunts ephippigers, and with these two\r\nwords light shines at once; there can be no mistake about my Sphex,\r\nnone other selecting that prey. And to illuminate the subject thus,\r\nwhat was needed? Real observation, and not to let entomology consist in\r\nrows of impaled insects. But let us pass on and consider such little as\r\nis known as to the manner in which foreign Sphegidæ hunt. I open\r\nLepeletier de St. Fargeau’s History of Hymenoptera, and find that on\r\nthe other side of the Mediterranean, in our Algerian provinces, S.\r\nflavipennis and S. albisecta have the same tastes that characterise\r\nthem here. In the land of palms they catch Orthoptera just as they do\r\nin the land of olives. Although separated by the width of the sea,\r\nthese sporting fellow citizens of the Kabyle and the Berber hunt the\r\nsame game as their relatives in Provence. I see mentioned a fourth\r\nspecies, S. afra, as hunting crickets round Oran. Moreover, I have a\r\nrecollection of having read—I know not where—of a fifth species, which\r\nmakes war on crickets upon the steppes in the neighbourhood of the\r\nCaspian Sea. Thus in the lands bordering the Mediterranean we have five\r\ndifferent species whose larvæ all live on Orthoptera.\r\n\r\nNow let us cross the equator, and descend in the other hemisphere to\r\nthe Mauritius and Réunion Islands, and we shall find, not a Sphex but a\r\nHymenopteron, nearly allied, of the same tribe, Chlorion or Ampulex,\r\nchasing the horrid kakerlacs, the curse of merchandise in ships and\r\ncolonial ports. These kakerlacs are none other than cockroaches, one\r\nspecies of which haunts our houses. Who does not know this stinking\r\ninsect, which, thanks to its flat shape, like that of an enormous bug,\r\ninsinuates itself into gaps in furniture and partitions, and swarms\r\neverywhere that there is food to devour. Such is the cockroach of our\r\nhouses—a disgusting likeness of the not less disgusting prey beloved by\r\nthe Chlorion. Why does a near relation of our Sphex select the kakerlac\r\nas prey. The reason is simple: With its buglike form the kakerlac is an\r\nOrthopteron by the same rights as the grasshopper, ephippiger, and\r\ncricket. From these six examples, the only ones known to me, and from\r\nsuch widely distant localities, may we not conclude that all Sphegidæ\r\nhunt Orthoptera? Without adopting so sweeping a conclusion, one at\r\nleast sees what the usual food of their larvæ must be.\r\n\r\nThere is a reason for this surprising choice. What is it? What motives\r\nfix a diet which in the strict limits of one and the same entomological\r\norder is now composed of ill-smelling kakerlacs, now of dry, but\r\nwell-flavoured crickets, and in yet another of plump grasshoppers, or\r\ncorpulent ephippigers? I confess that to me it is incomprehensible, and\r\nI leave the problem to others. Observe, however, that the Orthoptera\r\nrank among insects as the ruminants do among mammalia. Endowed with a\r\nmighty paunch and a placid character, they feed on herbage, and easily\r\nget corpulent. They are numerous and met with everywhere, slow of gait,\r\nand thus easy to catch, and, moreover, of a size just right for prey.\r\nWho can say if the Sphegidæ—vigorous hunters which require a large\r\nprey—do not find in these ruminants among insects what we find in our\r\ndomestic ruminants—the sheep and ox, peaceful victims rich in flesh?\r\nThis is, however, a mere supposition.\r\n\r\nI have more than a supposition in another case, equally important. Do\r\nthe consumers of Orthoptera ever vary their diet? Should their\r\nfavourite game fail, can they do with another? Does S. occitanica think\r\nthat except a fat ephippiger, there is nothing in the wide world worth\r\neating. Does S. albisecta admit nothing but crickets to her table, and\r\nS. flavipennis only grasshoppers? Or according to time, place, and\r\ncircumstance, does each replace the favourite food by some equivalent?\r\nIt would be of the highest importance to bring forward such facts if\r\nthey exist, as they would tell us whether the suggestions of instinct\r\nare absolute and immutable, or if they vary, and within what limits. It\r\nis true that in the cell of a Cerceris are buried most varied species\r\nof Buprestids or of the Weevil group, which shows that she has a great\r\nlatitude of choice; but such an extension of hunting ground cannot be\r\nsupposed for the Sphex, which I have found so faithful to one exclusive\r\nprey, invariable for each species, and which, moreover, finds among the\r\nOrthoptera kinds of very different shapes. I have, however, had the\r\ngood fortune to meet with one case—only one—of complete change in the\r\nlarva’s food, and I mention it the more willingly in the archives of\r\nthe Sphegidæ because such facts, scrupulously observed, will one day be\r\ncorner-stones for him who may desire to build the psychology of\r\ninstinct on solid foundations.\r\n\r\nThis is my fact. The scene is on a jetty by the Rhône. On one side is\r\nthe great river, with its thunder of waters, on the other, a dense\r\nthicket of osiers, willows, and reeds, and between the two a narrow\r\npath with a bed of fine sand. A yellow-winged Sphex appears, hopping\r\nand dragging its prey along. What do I see! It is no grasshopper, but a\r\ncommon Acridian! And yet the Hymenopteron really is the Sphex so well\r\nknown to me (S. flavipennis), the energetic huntress of grasshoppers! I\r\ncan hardly believe my eyes. The burrow is not far off; she enters and\r\nstores her booty. I seat myself, determined to await a new\r\nexpedition—wait hours if need be to see if so extraordinary a capture\r\nis repeated. Seated there I occupy the whole width of the path. Two\r\nsimple conscripts come up, new-clipped, with that incomparable,\r\nautomaton-look conferred by the first days of barrack life. They are\r\nchattering together—no doubt talking of their homes and the girls they\r\nleft behind them; each is peeling a willow switch with a knife. A fear\r\nseizes me; ah! it is not easy to try an experiment on the public way,\r\nwhere, when some fact watched for during long years does present\r\nitself, a passer-by may disturb or annihilate chances which may never\r\noccur again! I rise anxiously to make way for the conscripts; I\r\nwithdraw into the osier bed, and leave the narrow way free. To do more\r\nwas not prudent; to say, “My good fellows, do not go that way,” would\r\nhave made bad worse. They would have supposed some snare hidden in the\r\nsand, and questions would have arisen to which no reply that would\r\nsatisfy them could have been given. My request, moreover, would have\r\nturned these idlers into lookers-on, very embarrassing company in such\r\nstudies, so I resolved to say nothing, and trust to my luck. Alas!\r\nalas! my star betrayed me. The heavy regulation boot was planted\r\nexactly on the Sphex’s roof. A shudder ran through me as though I had\r\nmyself received the impress of the iron heel.\r\n\r\nThe conscripts gone I proceeded to the salvage of the contents of the\r\nruined burrow. There was the Sphex mutilated by the pressure, and there\r\nwere not only the cricket which I saw carried down, but two\r\nothers—three crickets in all instead of the usual grasshoppers. What\r\nwas the reason of this strange variation? Were there no grasshoppers\r\nnear the burrow, and did the distressed Hymenopteron do the best she\r\ncould with Acridians—contenting herself as it were with blackbirds for\r\nwant of thrushes, as the proverb says? I hesitate to believe it, for\r\nthere was nothing in the neighbourhood to denote absence of her\r\nfavourite game. Some happier means may unriddle this new problem. In\r\nany case S. flavipennis, either from imperious necessity, or from\r\nmotives unknown to me, sometimes replaces her favourite prey, the\r\ngrasshopper, by another, the Acridian, altogether unlike outwardly to\r\nthe former, but still an Orthopteron.\r\n\r\nThe observer on whose authority Lepeletier de St. Fargeau speaks of\r\nthis Sphex’s habits witnessed in Africa, near Oran, a similar storing\r\nof Acridians. S. flavipennis was surprised by him dragging along an\r\nAcridian. Was it an accidental case, like the one seen by me on the\r\nbanks of the Rhône? Was it the exception, or was it the rule? Were\r\ngrasshoppers wanting around Oran, and did the Hymenopteron replace them\r\nby Acridians? Circumstances compel me to ask the question without\r\nfinding a reply.\r\n\r\nHere should be interpolated a certain passage from Lacordaire’s\r\nIntroduction to Entomology, [6] against which I long to raise my voice\r\nin protest. Here it is: “Darwin, who has written a book on purpose to\r\nprove the identity of the intellectual principle which produces action\r\nin man and animals, walking one day in his garden noticed on the ground\r\nin a shady walk a Sphex which had just caught a fly nearly as big as\r\nitself. He saw it cut off with its mandibles the victim’s head and\r\nabdomen, keeping only the thorax, to which the wings remained attached.\r\nIt then flew away, but a breath of wind striking the fly’s wings\r\ntwirled the Sphex round, and hindered its progress. Thereupon it lit\r\nagain on the walk, cut off first one wing and then the other from the\r\nfly, and having thus removed the cause of its difficulties, flew off\r\nwith the remainder of its prey. This fact indicates manifest signs of\r\nreasoning. Instinct might have induced the Sphex to cut off the wings\r\nof its victim before transporting it to the nest, as do some species of\r\nthe same genus, but here were consecutive ideas and results of those\r\nideas quite inexplicable, unless one admits the intervention of\r\nreason.”\r\n\r\nThis little story, which so lightly bestows reason on an insect, is\r\nwanting not only in truth but in mere probability—not in the act\r\nitself, which I do not question at all, but in its motives. Darwin saw\r\nwhat he relates, but he was mistaken as to the hero of the drama; as to\r\nthe drama itself, and as to its meaning—profoundly mistaken, and I can\r\nprove it.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost the old English savant ought to have known enough\r\nabout the creatures which he so freely ennobles to call things by their\r\nright name. Let us therefore take the word Sphex in its strictly\r\nscientific sense. Then by what strange aberration does this English\r\nSphex, if English ones there are, choose a fly as its prey when its\r\nfellows hunt such different game—namely, Orthoptera? And even if we\r\ngrant, what I consider inadmissible, a Sphex catching flies, other\r\ndifficulties crowd in. It is now proved on evidence that the burrowing\r\nHymenoptera do not carry dead bodies to their larvæ, but merely prey\r\nbenumbed and paralysed. What, then, is the meaning of this prey whose\r\nhead, abdomen, and wings are cut off? The torso carried away is but a\r\nportion of a corpse that would infect the cell and be useless to the\r\nlarva, not yet to be hatched for several days. It is perfectly clear\r\nthat Darwin’s insect was not a Sphex, strictly speaking. What, then,\r\ndid he see? The word fly, by which the captured prey is designated, is\r\na very vague term which might be applied to the greater part of the\r\nimmense order of Diptera, and therefore leaves us uncertain among\r\nthousands of species. Probably the name of Sphex is used equally\r\nvaguely. When Darwin’s book appeared, not only the real Sphegidæ were\r\nso called, but also the Crabronides. Now among these last some provide\r\ntheir larvæ with Diptera, the prey required for the unknown\r\nHymenopteron of the English naturalist. Was then Darwin’s Sphex a\r\nCrabro? No, for these hunters of Diptera, like the hunters of any other\r\ngame, require prey which will keep fresh and motionless, but half alive\r\nfor the fortnight or three weeks needed before the eggs hatch, and for\r\nthe complete development of the larvæ. These little ogres require meat\r\nnot decayed, nor even high, but fresh. I know no exception to this\r\nrule, and therefore the name Sphex cannot have been used in its old\r\nmeaning.\r\n\r\nInstead of dealing with a precise fact, really worthy of science, we\r\nhave an enigma to find out. Let us continue to examine it. Several of\r\nthe Crabronides are so like wasps in figure and form and shape and\r\ntheir yellow and black livery, that they might deceive any eye\r\nunpractised in the delicate distinctions of entomology. In the eyes of\r\nevery one who has not made a special study of the subject, a Crabro is\r\na wasp. Is it not possible that the English observer, regarding things\r\nfrom a lofty height, and considering unworthy of close examination the\r\npetty fact, which, however, was to serve to corroborate his\r\ntranscendent views and grant reason to animals, may have in his turn\r\ncommitted an error, conversely and very excusably, by taking a wasp for\r\none of the Crabronides? I could almost declare it is so, and for the\r\nfollowing reasons. Wasps, if not always at any rate frequently, bring\r\nup their family on animal food, but instead of provisioning each cell\r\nthey distribute nourishment singly to the larvæ, and several times in\r\nthe day; feeding them from their mouths with soft pap, as the father\r\nand mother do young birds. This pap consists of mashed insects, ground\r\ndown in the jaws of the nursing wasp; the insects preferred for it are\r\nDiptera, especially the common fly; if fresh meat offers itself it is\r\nlargely used. Who has not seen wasps penetrate into our kitchens, or\r\ndart on the joints in a butcher’s shop, cut off some scrap of flesh\r\nwhich suits them, and carry away a tiny spoil for the use of their\r\nlarvæ? When half-closed shutters allow a ray of light to fall on the\r\nfloor of a room where the house-fly is taking a comfortable nap, or\r\nbrushing its wings, who has not seen a wasp suddenly enter, pounce upon\r\nit, crush it in its jaws, and flee with the booty? This again is a\r\ndainty meal for the carnivorous nurslings. Sometimes the prey is at\r\nonce dismembered, sometimes on the way, sometimes at the nest. The\r\nwings, in which there is no nourishment, are cut off and rejected; the\r\nfeet, poor in juices, are also sometimes disdained. There remains a\r\nmutilated corpse, head, thorax, abdomen, or part thereof, which the\r\nwasp chews repeatedly to reduce into a pap for the larvæ to feast on. I\r\nhave tried to bring up larvæ  myself on fly-paste. The experiment was\r\ntried on a nest of Polistes gallica, the wasp which fixes her little\r\nrose-shaped nest of gray paper cells on the bough of some shrub. My\r\nkitchen apparatus was a piece of marble slab, on which I crushed up the\r\nfly-paste after cleaning my game—in other words, having taken away the\r\nparts which were too tough—wings and feet; and the feeding-spoon was a\r\nslender straw, at the end of which, going from cell to cell, I handed\r\nthe food to larvæ, which opened their mouths just like young birds in a\r\nnest. I did just the same and succeeded just as well in the days when I\r\nused to bring up broods of sparrows—that joy of childhood! All went on\r\nas well as heart could wish as long as my patience held out against the\r\ntrials of a bringing up so absorbing and full of small cares.\r\n\r\nThe obscurity of the enigma is replaced by the full light of truth,\r\nthanks to the following observation, made with all the leisure that a\r\nstrict precision demands. In the first days of October two great clumps\r\nof blossoming asters at the door of my study became the rendezvous of a\r\nquantity of insects, among which the hive bee and Eristalis tenax were\r\nthe most numerous. A gentle murmur arose from them, like that of which\r\nVirgil wrote, “Sæpe levi somnum suadebit inire susurro.” But if the\r\npoet finds in it only an invitation to slumber, the naturalist finds a\r\nsubject for study; these small folk luxuriating on the last flowers of\r\nthe year may perhaps afford him some new information. So I am on the\r\nwatch before the two clumps with their countless lilac corollas.\r\n\r\nThe air is perfectly still; the sun burns, the air is heavy—all signs\r\nof a coming storm; but these are conditions eminently favourable to the\r\nlabours of the Hymenoptera, which seem to foresee to-morrow’s rain, and\r\nredouble their activity in turning the present hour to profit. The bees\r\nwork ardently; the Eristalis fly clumsily from flower to flower. Now\r\nand then, into the midst of the peaceable throng who are swilling\r\nnectar, bursts a wasp, insect of rapine, attracted there by prey, not\r\nhoney.\r\n\r\nEqually ardent in carnage, but unequal in strength, two species divide\r\nthe chase; the common wasp, Vespa vulgaris, which catches Eristalis,\r\nand the hornet, V. crabro, which hunts hive bees. Both carry on the\r\nchase in the same way. They fly fast backwards and forwards over the\r\nflowers, and suddenly throw themselves on the prey which is on its\r\nguard and flies off, while their impulse carries them headfirst against\r\nthe deserted flower. Then the chase is continued in the air, just as a\r\nsparrowhawk hunts a lark. But bee and Eristalis foil the wasp by their\r\nsudden turns, and it goes back to fly above the blossoms. By and by\r\nsome insect less swift to escape gets captured. The common wasp\r\ninstantly drops on the turf with its Eristalis, and I drop down too at\r\nthe same moment, putting aside with both hands the dead leaves and bits\r\nof grass which might hinder my seeing clearly, and this is the drama\r\nwhich I behold, if proper precautions be taken not to scare the wasp.\r\n\r\nFirst there is a wild struggle among the blades of grass between the\r\nwasp and an Eristalis bigger than itself. The Dipteron is unarmed but\r\nstrong, and a shrill hum tells of desperate resistance. The wasp\r\ncarries a poignard, but does not know how to use it methodically, and\r\nis ignorant of the vulnerable points so well known to the hunters which\r\nneed flesh that must keep good for a considerable time. What its\r\nnurslings want is a paste made of flies newly crushed, so that it\r\nmatters little how the game is killed. The sting is used\r\nblindly—anywhere, pointed at the head, sides, thorax, or under part of\r\nthe victim, as chance directs while the two wrestle. The Hymenopteron,\r\nparalysing its victim, acts like the surgeon, who directs his scalpel\r\nwith a skilled hand; the wasp when slaying acts like a common assassin\r\nstabbing blindly in a struggle. Thus the resistance of the Eristalis is\r\nlong, and its death rather the result of being cut up by a pair of\r\nscissors than of stabs with a dagger. These scissors are the wasp’s\r\nmandibles, cutting, disembowelling, and dividing. When the game has\r\nbeen garroted and is motionless between the feet of its captor, a bite\r\nof the mandibles severs the head from the body; then the wings are\r\nshorn off at the junction with the shoulder; the feet follow, cut off\r\none by one; then the abdomen is rejected, but emptied of its interior,\r\nwhich the wasp appears to preserve with her favourite part, the thorax,\r\nwhich is richer in muscle than the rest of the Eristalis. Without\r\nfurther delay she flies off, carrying it between her feet. Having\r\nreached the nest she will mash it up and distribute it to the larvæ.\r\n\r\nThe hornet having seized a bee acts almost in the same way, but it is a\r\ngiant of a robber, and the fight cannot last long, despite the sting of\r\nthe victim. Upon the very flower where the capture was made, or oftener\r\non some twig of a neighbouring shrub, the hornet prepares its dish.\r\nFirst of all the bag of the bee is torn open, and the honey lapped up.\r\nThe prize is thus twofold—that of a drop of honey, and the bee itself\r\nfor the larvæ  to feast on. Sometimes the wings are detached, as well\r\nas the abdomen, but generally the hornet is contented with making a\r\nshapeless mass of the bee which is carried off whole. It is at the nest\r\nthat the parts valueless for food are rejected, especially the wings.\r\nOr the paste may be prepared on the spot, the bee being crushed at once\r\nbetween the hornet’s mandibles, after wings, feet, and sometimes the\r\nabdomen are cut off.\r\n\r\nHere, then, in all its details is the fact observed by Darwin. A wasp,\r\nVespa vulgaris, seizes Eristalis tenax; with her mandibles she cuts off\r\nhead, wings, and abdomen of the victim, keeping only the thorax, with\r\nwhich she flies away. But we need no breath of air to explain why they\r\nwere cut off; the scene takes place in perfect shelter, in the grass.\r\nThe captor rejects such parts as are useless for the larvæ, and that is\r\nall.\r\n\r\nIn short, a wasp is certainly the heroine of Darwin’s story. What,\r\nthen, becomes of that reasoning which made the creature, in order\r\nbetter to contend with the wind, deprive its prey of abdomen, head, and\r\nwings, leaving only a thorax? It becomes a very simple fact, whence\r\nflow none of the great consequences that were drawn from it,—the very\r\ntrivial fact that a wasp began at once to cut up her prey, and only\r\nconsidered the trunk worthy of her larvæ. Far from discovering the\r\nleast indication of reasoning, I see only an act of instinct so\r\nelementary that it is really not worth consideration.\r\n\r\nTo abase man and exalt animals in order to establish a point of\r\ncontact, then a point of fusion,—such has been the usual system of the\r\nadvanced theories now in fashion. Ah! how often do we not find in these\r\nsublime theories that are a sickly craze of our day, proofs\r\nperemptorily asserted, which under the light of experiment would appear\r\nas absurd as the Sphex of the learned Erasmus Darwin!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nTHE SPHEX OF LANGUEDOC\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the chemist has ripely considered his plan of research, he mixes\r\nhis reactives at whatever moment suits him best, and sets his retorts\r\non the fire. He is master of time, place, and circumstance, chooses his\r\nown hour, isolates himself in his laboratory, where he will be\r\nundisturbed, and brings about such or such conditions as reflexion may\r\nsuggest. He is searching out the secrets of brute nature, whose\r\nchemical activities science can arouse at will.\r\n\r\nThe secrets of living nature—not those of anatomy, but those of life in\r\naction, especially of instinct—offer conditions far more difficult and\r\ndelicate to the observer. Far from being able to take his own time, he\r\nis the slave of season, day, or hour, even of the moment. If an\r\nopportunity offer, it must be seized at once—it may be very long ere it\r\ncomes again. And as it usually comes just when one is thinking least\r\nabout it, nothing is ready whereby to turn it to account. One must\r\nimprovise there and then one’s little means of experiment, combine\r\none’s plan, devise one’s wiles, imagine one’s tactics, and feel only\r\ntoo fortunate if inspiration come quickly enough to allow one to profit\r\nby the chance offered. Moreover, such chances come only to one who\r\nlooks out for them, watches for days and days,—here on sandy slopes\r\nexposed to the burning sun, there in the cauldron of some path enclosed\r\nby high banks, or on some shelf of sandstone, the solidity of which is\r\nnot always such as to inspire confidence. If it be granted you to set\r\nup your observatory under the scanty shade of an olive that you may\r\nthink will shelter you from a pitiless sun, then bless the fate which\r\nis treating you like a sybarite; your lot is in Eden. Above all—keep a\r\nsharp lookout. The spot is promising, and who knows? Any moment the\r\nchance may come.\r\n\r\nIt has come! tardily, it is true, but it has come. Ah! could one but\r\nobserve now, in the peace of one’s study, isolated, absorbed, thinking\r\nonly of what one is studying, far from the profane passer-by who will\r\nstop, seeing you so preoccupied where he sees nothing, will overwhelm\r\nyou with questions and take you for a diviner of springs with the magic\r\nhazel wand, or worse, as a doubtful character, seeking by incantations\r\nold pots full of money hidden underground. Even if you seem to him to\r\nhave the look of a Christian, he will come near, look at what you are\r\nlooking at, and smile in a fashion which leaves no possible doubt as to\r\nhis humble opinion of people who spend their time in watching flies.\r\nYou would only be too happy if this annoying visitor would depart,\r\nlaughing in his sleeve, but without disturbing everything and repeating\r\nthe disaster caused by the soles of my two conscripts.\r\n\r\nOr if it is not the passer-by who is perplexed by your unaccountable\r\nproceedings, it will be the garde-champêtre, that inexorable\r\nrepresentative of the law amid the fallow fields. Long has he had his\r\neye upon you. He has so often seen you wandering like a troubled ghost\r\nfor no reason that he can perceive; has so often caught you seeking\r\nsomething in the ground, or knocking down some bit of wall in some\r\nhollow way with infinite precaution that he begins to look on you as a\r\nsuspicious character, a vagabond, a gipsy, a tramp, or, at all events,\r\na maniac. If you have a botanical tin, to him it is the ferret-cage of\r\nthe poacher, and it will be impossible to convince him that you are not\r\ndestroying all the rabbits in the neighbouring warrens, regardless of\r\nthe laws of the chase and the rights of the owner. Beware! However\r\nthirsty you may be, lay no finger on a cluster in the vineyard hard by;\r\nthe man of the municipal livery would be there, delighted to bear\r\nwitness and get at last an explanation of your exasperatingly\r\nperplexing conduct.\r\n\r\nI must do myself the justice to say that I have never committed such a\r\nmisdeed, and yet one day when I was lying on the sand, absorbed in the\r\ndomestic affairs of a Bembex, I heard beside me, “In the name of the\r\nlaw, I summon you to follow me!” It was the garde-champêtre of Les\r\nAngles, who having vainly watched for an opportunity of catching me in\r\nsome offence, and being daily more desirous of an answer to the riddle\r\nwhich tormented him, had finally decided on a summons. An explanation\r\nbecame necessary. The poor man did not appear in the least convinced.\r\n“Bah! bah!” said he, “you’ll never get me to believe that you come and\r\nroast yourself in the sun just to watch flies. I keep my eye on you,\r\nyou know, and the first time.... Well, that’s enough.” He departed. I\r\nhave always believed that my red ribbon had a good deal to do with this\r\ndeparture, and I ascribe to that ribbon other similar services during\r\nmy botanical or entomological rambles. It seemed to me—was it an\r\nillusion?—it did seem to me that during my botanical expeditions on\r\nMont Ventoux, the guide was more manageable than usual and the donkey\r\nless obstinate.\r\n\r\nThe little dark red ribbon has not always protected me from the\r\ntribulations the entomologist must expect when carrying on experiments\r\nupon the highway. Since dawn I had been lying in ambush at the bottom\r\nof a ravine; Sphex occitanica was the object of my early visit. A party\r\nof three women vintagers passed on their way to work. A glance was cast\r\non the seated figure apparently lost in thought. “Good day” was\r\npolitely offered and politely answered. At sunset the women returned\r\nwith full baskets. The man was still there, seated on the same stone,\r\nhis eyes fixed on the same spot. My motionless figure, my persistent\r\nstay in that lonely place, must have struck them greatly. As they\r\npassed I saw one tap her forehead, and heard her whisper, “A poor\r\ninnocent, pe’caïre! a poor innocent!” and all three made the sign of\r\nthe cross.\r\n\r\nAn innocent, an idiot, a poor inoffensive creature who is deficient;\r\nand all three crossed themselves—an idiot being one to them marked by\r\nGod’s seal. “How?” said I. “What cruel mockery of fate! You who are\r\nlabouring to discover what is instinct and what reason in the animal;\r\nyou yourself are a half-wit in the eyes of these women! What\r\nhumiliation! However, pe’caïre, that term of supreme commiseration in\r\nProvençal, uttered from the bottom of the heart, made me quickly forget\r\nthe Innocent.”\r\n\r\nIt is to that same ravine that I invite my reader, if he is not\r\nrepelled by the small annoyances of which I have given him a foretaste.\r\nS. occitanica haunts these parts, not in numbers giving one another\r\nrendezvous when nidification is going on, but solitary individuals far\r\napart, wherever their vagabond peregrinations have led them. Just as\r\ntheir relative S. flavipennis seeks the society of relations and the\r\nanimation of a work-yard and company, so, on the other hand, does the\r\nLanguedocian Sphex prefer calm, isolation, and solitude. Graver in\r\nbehaviour, more formal in manner, more elegant of figure, and in more\r\nsombre attire, she always lives apart, careless of what others are\r\ndoing, disdaining companionship, a very misanthrope among Sphegidæ. S.\r\nflavipennis is sociable; S. occitanica is unsociable—a profound\r\ndifference, alone sufficient to characterise them.\r\n\r\nThis suggests how greatly the difficulty of observing the latter is\r\nincreased. No long meditated experiment is possible, nor can one\r\nattempt to repeat it a second time if the first has failed. If you make\r\npreparations beforehand,—for instance, if you put in reserve a piece of\r\ngame to substitute for that of the Sphex,—it is to be feared, indeed it\r\nis almost certain, that she will not appear, or if she comes, your\r\npreparations turn out useless. Everything must be improvised at\r\nonce—conditions which I have not always been able to realise as I could\r\nhave wished.\r\n\r\nLet us take courage; the position is good. Many a time I have here\r\nsurprised the Sphex reposing on a vine-leaf, exposed to the full rays\r\nof the sun. The insect, lying flat and spread out, is voluptuously\r\nenjoying the delights of warmth and light. From time to time a kind of\r\nfrenzy of pleasure bursts forth in her; she thrills with well-being,\r\ndrums rapidly on her resting-place with the points of her feet, and\r\nproduces a sound somewhat like the roll of a drum, or heavy rain\r\nfalling on foliage perpendicularly. You may hear this joyous drumming\r\nseveral paces off. Then again comes perfect stillness, followed by a\r\nfresh nervous commotion, and that waving of tarsi which is a sign of\r\nsupreme happiness. I have known some of these ardent sun-worshippers\r\nsuddenly leave a half-finished burrow to settle on a neighbouring vine\r\nand take a bath of sun and light, returning reluctantly to give a\r\ncareless sweep to the hole, and finally abandon the workshop, unable\r\nlonger to resist the temptation of luxuriating on a vine leaf. Perhaps\r\nthis voluptuous resting-place is also an observatory whence to inspect\r\nthe neighbourhood, and espy and choose prey. This Sphex catches only\r\nthe ephippiger of the vine, scattered here and there on the leaves or\r\non any convenient bush. The game is succulent—all the more that only\r\nfemales full of eggs are selected.\r\n\r\nLet us pass over numerous expeditions, fruitless researches, and the\r\ntedium of long waiting, and present the Sphex to the reader just as she\r\nshows herself to the observer. Here she is, at the bottom of a hollow\r\nway with high sandy banks. She comes on foot, but aids herself with her\r\nwings in dragging along her heavy captive. The ephippiger’s antennæ,\r\nlike long fine threads, are the harness ropes. With her mandibles and\r\nholding her head high, she grasps one of them, passing it between her\r\nfeet, and the prey is dragged on its back. If some unevenness of ground\r\nshould oppose itself to this style of haulage, she stops, clasps the\r\nample provender, and transports it by very short flights, going on foot\r\nbetween whiles whenever this is possible. One never sees her undertake\r\nsustained flights for long distances carrying prey, as do those strong\r\ncruisers, the Bembex and Cerceris, which will carry perhaps for a good\r\nhalf mile through the air, the former their Diptera, the latter their\r\nweevils—very light prey compared with the huge ephippiger. The\r\noverwhelming size of its captive forces S. occitanica to convey it\r\nalong the ground—a means of transit both slow and difficult. The same\r\nreason—namely, the great size and weight of the prey—entirely upsets\r\nthe usual order followed by the Hymenoptera, in their labours,—an order\r\nwell known, and consisting in first hollowing a burrow and then\r\nvictualling it. The prey not being disproportioned to the size of the\r\nspoiler, facility of transport by flight allows the Hymenopteron a\r\nchoice as to the position of her domicile. What matter if she has to\r\nhunt at considerable distances? Having made a capture, she returns home\r\nwith rapid flight; it is indifferent to her whether she is near or far.\r\nTherefore she prefers the spot where she was born, and where her\r\npredecessors have lived; there she inherits deep galleries, the\r\naccumulated labour of former generations; with a little repair they can\r\nbe used as avenues to new chambers, better defended than would be a\r\nsingle excavation a little below the surface made annually. Such is the\r\ncase with Cerceris tuberculata and Philanthus apivorus, and even if the\r\ninherited dwelling should not be solid enough to resist wind and\r\nweather from one year’s end to another, and to be handed down to the\r\nnext generation, at all events the Hymenopteron finds conditions of\r\ngreater safety in spots consecrated by ancestral experience. There she\r\nhollows out galleries, each serving as corridors to a group of cells,\r\nthus economising the labour to be expended on the entire egg-laying.\r\n\r\nIn this way are formed, not true societies, there being no concerted\r\neffort to a common end, but at least gatherings where the sight of\r\nother Sphegidæ no doubt animates the labour of each. In fact, one can\r\nnotice between these small tribes, sprung from one and the same stock,\r\nand the solitary miners, a difference in activity, recalling in one\r\ncase the emulation of a populous workshop, and in the other the dulness\r\nof labourers in the tedium of isolation. For the animal as well as man\r\nactivity is contagious, and excited by its own example. Let us sum up.\r\nWhere there is a moderate weight for the spoiler, it is possible to\r\ncarry it on the wing for a great distance, and then the Hymenopteron\r\ncan arrange the burrows at pleasure, choosing by preference its\r\nbirthplace. From this preference of the birthplace results an\r\nagglomeration—a coming together of insects of the same species, whence\r\narises emulation in their work. This first step towards social life is\r\nthe result of easy journeys. Is it not so with man? excuse the\r\ncomparison! Men, where ways are bad, build solitary cottages, while\r\nwhere there are good roads, they collect in populous cities, served by\r\nrailroads, which, so to say, annihilate distance; they assemble in\r\nimmense human hives called London or Paris.\r\n\r\nThe Languedocian Sphex has quite another lot. Its prey is a heavy\r\nephippiger—a single morsel representing the whole sum of provender\r\namassed by the other predatory insects bit by bit. What the Cerceris\r\nand other strong-flying insects do by dividing their labour is\r\naccomplished by a single effort. The weight of the prey rendering\r\nflight impossible, it must be brought home with all the delays and\r\nfatigue of dragging it along the ground. This one fact obliges her to\r\naccommodate the position of her burrow to the chances of the chase:\r\nfirst the prey and then the dwelling. Hence no rendezvous at a general\r\nmeeting-place; no living among neighbours, no tribes stimulating\r\nthemselves by mutual example—only isolation where chance has led the\r\nSphex—solitary labour, unenthusiastic, though always conscientious.\r\nFirst of all prey is sought, attacked, and paralysed. Then comes making\r\nthe burrow. A favourable spot is chosen as near as possible to that\r\nwhere lies the victim, so as to abridge the toil of transport, and the\r\ncell of the future larva is rapidly hollowed to receive an egg and food\r\nas soon as possible. Such is the very different method shown by all my\r\nobservations. I will mention the chief of them.\r\n\r\nIf surprised in its mining, one always finds this Sphex alone—sometimes\r\nat the bottom of some dusty niche a fallen stone has left in an old\r\nwall—sometimes in a shelter formed by a projecting bit of sandstone,\r\nsuch as is sought by the fierce-eyed lizard as a vestibule to its\r\nretreat. The sun falls full upon it; the place is a furnace. The soil\r\nis extremely easy to hollow, formed as it is by ancient dust which has\r\ndropped little by little from the roof. The mandibles, which act as\r\npincers to dig with, and the tarsi, as rakes to clear away, soon hollow\r\nthe cavity. Then the Sphex flies off, but in a leisurely way, and\r\nwithout any great expenditure of wing power, a manifest sign that the\r\nexpedition is not a long one. One’s eye can easily follow the insect\r\nand discover where it alights, usually some ten yards off. Sometimes it\r\ndecides to go on foot. It sets out, hurrying to a spot where we will be\r\nindiscreet enough to follow, our presence noways troubling it. Having\r\narrived on foot or on the wing it hunts about for a while, as one may\r\nconclude from its indecision and short excursions on all sides. It\r\nseeks and at last finds, or rather finds anew. The object found is an\r\nephippiger, half-paralysed, but still moving antennæ, tarsi, and\r\novipositor—a victim which the Sphex certainly poignarded a little while\r\nbefore with several stings, and then left her prey, an embarrassing\r\nburden, while she still hesitated as to the choice of a domicile.\r\nPerhaps she abandoned it on the very spot of the capture, leaving it\r\nrather obvious on a grass tuft the better to find it later, and\r\ntrusting to her good memory to return where lies the booty, set to work\r\nto explore the neighbourhood and find a suitable spot to burrow. This\r\ndone she came back for the game which was found without much\r\nhesitation, and now she prepares to convey it home. She bestrides the\r\ninsect, seizes one or both antennæ and sets off, pulling and dragging\r\nwith all the strength of loins and jaws.\r\n\r\nSometimes the journey is accomplished at one trial; more frequently she\r\nleaves her load and hurries home. Perhaps it occurs to her that the\r\nentrance door is not wide enough for this ample morsel, perhaps she\r\nbethinks her of some defect of detail that might interfere with\r\nprovisioning the cell. Yes, she retouches her work, enlarges the\r\ndoorway, levels the threshold, consolidates the arch, all with a few\r\nsweeps of the tarsi. Then she returns to the ephippiger, lying on its\r\nback a few paces distant, and drags it on again. But a new idea seems\r\nto flash across her lively mind. She had visited the gateway but had\r\nnot looked within; who knows if all be well there? She hastens back,\r\nleaving the ephippiger midway. The interior is visited, and apparently\r\nsome touches as with a trowel are given by the tarsi, to lend a last\r\nfinish to the walls. Without lingering over these final touches the\r\nSphex returns to her prey, and harnesses herself to the antennæ.\r\nForward! Will the journey be accomplished this time? I would not answer\r\nfor it. I have known a Sphex, perhaps more suspicious than others, or\r\nmore forgetful of the minor details of architecture, set her omissions\r\nright or allay her suspicions by abandoning her prey five or six times\r\nsuccessively, and hurrying to the burrow, which each time was touched\r\nup a little or simply entered. It is true that others go straight home,\r\nwithout even stopping to rest. I must add that when the Sphex comes\r\nhome to perfect her dwelling, she does not fail to give an occasional,\r\ndistant glance at the ephippiger left on the way, to make sure that\r\nnothing touches it. This prudence recalls that of the Scarabæus sacer\r\nissuing from the hole which it is digging to feel its dear ball, and\r\nbring it a little nearer.\r\n\r\nThe deduction to be drawn from the facts just stated is evident. Since\r\nevery Sphex occitanica we surprise while it burrows—be it at the very\r\nbeginning, at the first stroke of her tarsi in the dust, or later, the\r\ndwelling being ready—makes a short expedition on foot or on the wing,\r\nand always finds a victim already stabbed, already paralysed, one may\r\nconclude with certainty that she first makes her capture, and later\r\nburrows, so that the place of capture decides that of the domicile.\r\n\r\nThis reversal of method which prepares the food before the larder,\r\nwhile previously we saw the larder precede the food, I attribute to the\r\nweight of the prey being too great to carry on the wing. It is not that\r\nS. occitanica is ill-organised for flight; on the contrary, she can\r\nsoar splendidly, but her prey would overwhelm her if she depended only\r\non her wings. She needs the support of the ground and must drag her\r\nprey, and displays wonderful vigour in doing this. Loaded with prey she\r\nalways goes on foot, or takes very short flights when these spare time\r\nand toil. Let me quote an instance taken from my latest observations on\r\nthis curious Hymenopteron.\r\n\r\nA Sphex appeared suddenly, whence I know not, dragging an ephippiger\r\napparently just caught hard by. As things were she had to burrow, but\r\nthe position was as bad as possible—a highway, hard as stone. There was\r\nno time for difficult mining, since the prey must be stored as soon as\r\npossible; she needed light soil where the cell could be quickly made. I\r\nhave already described her favourite soil—dust deposed by years at the\r\nbottom of some hole in a wall, or in some little hollow of a rock. The\r\nSphex which I was observing stopped at the foot of a country house with\r\na newly whitewashed façade, and measuring from six to eight metres in\r\nheight. Instinct told her that under the roof tiles she would find\r\nhollows rich in ancient dust. Leaving her prey at the foot of the\r\nfaçade, she flew on to the roof. For some time I saw her seek vainly\r\nabout. Then, having found a suitable position, she set to work under\r\nthe hollow of a tile. In ten minutes or a quarter of an hour at most\r\nthe domicile was ready; she flew down, promptly found the ephippiger,\r\nand then had to carry up her prey. Would it be on the wing, as\r\ncircumstances suggest? Not at all; the Sphex adopted the difficult\r\nmethod of escalading a vertical wall with a surface smoothed by the\r\nmason’s trowel and from six to eight metres high. Seeing her take this\r\nroad, dragging her game between her feet, I thought at first that it\r\nwas impossible, but was soon reassured as to the outcome of this\r\naudacious attempt. Supporting herself by the little roughnesses of the\r\nmortar, the vigorous insect, in spite of the embarrassment of her heavy\r\nload, made her way up this vertical plane with the same security, the\r\nsame speed, as on horizontal ground. The top is reached without any\r\nhindrance, and the prey provisionally deposited at the edge of the roof\r\non the rounded bark of a tile. While the Sphex was retouching her\r\nburrow the ill-balanced prey slipped and fell to the foot of the wall.\r\nShe must begin again, and again by means of an escalade. The same\r\nimprudence is repeated; once more left on the curved tile the prey\r\nslips and falls to the ground. With a calm which such accidents cannot\r\ndisturb, the Sphex for the third time hoists the ephippiger by climbing\r\nthe wall, and, better advised, drags it straight to the bottom of the\r\nhole.\r\n\r\nIf carrying the prey on the wing has not been attempted even in such\r\nconditions as the above, it is clear that the Sphex is incapable of\r\nflight with so heavy a load. To this impotence we owe the few details\r\nof habits which are the subject of this chapter. A prey not too heavy\r\nto be carried on the wing makes a semi-sociable species of S.\r\nflavipennis—that is to say, one seeking the company of its fellows; a\r\nheavy prey impossible to carry through the air renders S. occitanica a\r\nspecies devoted to solitary labour—a kind of savage, disdainful of the\r\nsolace derived from neighbourhood of one’s fellows. The greater or\r\nlesser weight of their prey decides the fundamental character.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nTHE SCIENCE OF INSTINCT\r\n\r\n\r\nI have no doubt that in order to paralyse her prey, Sphex occitanica\r\nfollows the method of the one that hunts grasshoppers, plunging her\r\nsting repeatedly into the breast of the ephippiger in order to reach\r\nthe thoracic ganglia. She must be familiar with the operation of\r\ninjuring the nerve centres, and I am assured beforehand of her\r\nconsummate skill in the learned operation. It is an art familiar to all\r\nthe predatory Hymenoptera who bear a poisoned dagger, and it is not\r\ngiven them for nothing. But I must own that I have never yet beheld the\r\ndeadly manœuvre, thanks to the solitary life of this Sphex.\r\n\r\nWhen a number of burrows are made and then provisioned on some common\r\nground, one has only to wait there to see now one insect return from\r\nthe chase, now another, with her prey, and it is easy to substitute a\r\nlive victim for the one sacrificed, renewing the experiment at will.\r\nBesides, the certainty that the subjects for experiment will not fail\r\nwhen wanted allows everything to be prepared beforehand, while with S.\r\noccitanica these conditions of success do not exist. To set out and\r\nlook for her with one’s preparations made is all but useless, so\r\nsparsely are these solitary insects scattered. Moreover, if you do meet\r\nwith one, it will probably be during her idle hour when nothing is to\r\nbe learned. I repeat that it is almost always unexpectedly, when you\r\nare not thinking about it, that the Sphex appears with her ephippiger.\r\nThis is the moment—the one propitious moment—to attempt a substitution\r\nof prey and to induce her to let you witness those dagger thrusts. Let\r\nus hasten; time presses; in a few moments the burrow will have enclosed\r\nthe provender, and the grand chance will be lost.\r\n\r\nNeed I speak of my mortification in these promising moments—a mocking\r\nlure offered by fortune! Under my eyes is matter for curious\r\nobservations, and I cannot profit by it! I cannot steal the Sphex’s\r\nsecret, for I have no equivalent to offer for her prey. Just try, if\r\nyou like, to go about looking for an ephippiger when there are but a\r\nfew minutes to find it in! Why, it took me three days of wild search\r\nbefore I could find weevils for my Cerceris! Yet twice did I make that\r\ndesperate attempt. Ah! if the garde-champêtre had caught me then\r\nrushing about the vineyards, what a chance he would have had to believe\r\nme guilty of theft, and of reporting me! Vines and grapes—nothing was\r\nrespected by my hurried steps, fettered by the vine garlands. I must\r\nand would have an ephippiger, and have it then and there. And once I\r\ndid find one during one of these rapid expeditions. I beamed with joy,\r\nlittle foreseeing the bitter disappointment awaiting me.\r\n\r\nIf only I can come in time! if only the Sphex is still dragging her\r\nvictim! Thank heaven! all favours me. She is still at some distance\r\nfrom her hole, and is bringing along her prey. With my pincers I gently\r\ndraw it back. She resists, clutches the antennæ and will not let go. I\r\npull harder, even making her go backwards; it is in vain, she holds on.\r\nI had with me a pair of delicate little scissors, part of my\r\nentomological outfit, and I rapidly cut the harness, otherwise the long\r\nantennæ of the ephippiger. The Sphex still advanced, but soon paused,\r\nsurprised by the sudden lightening of her load, which now indeed only\r\nconsisted of the antennæ detached by my malicious artifice. The real\r\nburden, the heavy-bodied insect, remained behind, instantly replaced by\r\nmy living one. The Sphex turned, let go the ropes, which now drew\r\nnothing, and retraced her steps. Now she is face to face with the prey\r\nsubstituted for her own. She examines it, walks round it with\r\nsuspicious caution, stops, wets her foot with saliva and washes her\r\neyes. While thus meditating does she say to herself something of this\r\nkind: “Well, am I awake or am I asleep? Do I see clearly or not? This\r\nthing is not mine. Of what or whom am I the dupe?” At all events she is\r\nin no haste to bite my prey. She holds aloof, and shows not the\r\nsmallest wish to seize it. To excite her I offered the insect with the\r\ntips of my fingers, putting the antennæ almost in her jaws, well aware\r\nof her audacious tameness, and that she will take from your fingers\r\nprey withdrawn and then offered. What is this? She draws back,\r\ndisdaining my offers and the prey put within her reach. I put down the\r\nephippiger, which, unconscious of danger, goes straight to its\r\nassassin. Now for it. Alas! no; the Sphex continues to draw back,\r\nbehaves like a veritable coward, and finally takes wing. I never saw\r\nher again. Thus ended to my confusion an experiment which had so\r\nexcited my enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nLater, and gradually, as I visited more burrows I came to understand my\r\nwant of success and the obstinate refusal of the Sphex. I always,\r\nwithout exception, found stored a female ephippiger with an abundant\r\nand succulent store of eggs inside her. This, it would seem, is the\r\nfavourite food of the larvæ. In my rush among the vines I had laid\r\nhands on one of the other sex. It was a male which I offered to the\r\nSphex! More clear-sighted than I in the great victualling question, she\r\nwould have nothing to say to my game. “A male! Is that the kind of\r\ndinner for my larvæ? And, pray, for whom do you take them?” How\r\nsensitive must be these dainty eaters who appreciate the difference\r\nbetween the tender flesh of the female and the comparatively dry body\r\nof the male! What a penetrating glance which can distinguish instantly\r\nthe one sex from the other, though alike in form and colour! The female\r\nhas an ovipositor to bury her eggs with, and this is almost the only\r\noutward difference between her and the male. This difference never\r\nescapes the keen-sighted Sphex, and that is why my experiment made her\r\nrub her eyes, immensely puzzled by a prey without an ovipositor, which\r\nshe was perfectly sure had one when it was caught. At such a\r\ntransformation what must have passed in her little Sphex brain?\r\n\r\nNow let us follow her when, the burrow being ready, she returns to find\r\nher victim, deserted not far from the place of capture, and after the\r\noperation which paralysed it. The ephippiger is in a state like that of\r\nthe cricket slain by S. flavipennis—a certain proof that stings have\r\nbeen darted into the ganglia of the thorax. Nevertheless, many\r\nmovements continue, but disconnected, though endowed with a certain\r\nvigour. Unable to stand, the insect lies on one side or on its back,\r\nmoving its long antennæ and palpi rapidly, opening and closing its\r\nmandibles, and biting as hard as in its normal condition. The abdomen\r\npants fast and deeply; the ovipositor is suddenly brought under the\r\nstomach, which it almost touches. The feet move, but languidly and\r\nirregularly, the middle ones seemingly more benumbed than the others.\r\nIf touched with a needle, the whole body starts wildly; efforts are\r\nmade to rise and walk without success. In short, the creature would be\r\nfull of life but for the impossibility of locomotion and even of\r\ngetting on its feet. There is then a paralysis altogether\r\nlocal—paralysis of the feet, or rather partial abolition and ataxy of\r\nmovement in them. Is this very incomplete inertia caused by some\r\nspecial disposition of the victim’s nervous system, or is it that only\r\na single stab is given, instead of wounding each ganglion of the\r\nthorax, as does the huntress of grasshoppers? I cannot say.\r\n\r\nHowever, for all its starts, its convulsions, its irregular movements,\r\nthe victim is none the less unable to harm the larvæ  destined to\r\ndevour it. I have taken from the Sphex’s burrow ephippigers struggling\r\njust as much as in the first moments of their semi-paralysis, and yet\r\nthe feeble grub, born but a few hours earlier, was biting the gigantic\r\nvictim with entire immunity. This striking result is caused by the\r\nmother laying her egg in one particular spot. I have already told how\r\nS. flavipennis glues her egg on the cricket’s breast, rather on one\r\nside, between the first and second pairs of feet. S. albisecta chooses\r\nthe same place, and S. occitanica an analogous one, rather further back\r\ntoward the base of one of the large hind thighs, all three thus\r\nevincing admirable knowledge as to where the egg will be safe.\r\n\r\nFor consider the ephippiger shut in the burrow. It is on its back,\r\nabsolutely incapable of turning over. Vainly does it struggle; the\r\nirregular movements of its feet are useless, the cell being too wide\r\nfor them to gain support from the walls. What do the victim’s\r\nconvulsions matter to the larva? It is on a spot where it cannot be\r\nreached by tarsi, mandibles, ovipositor, or antennæ—a point absolutely\r\nmotionless, where there is not even a shudder of the skin. There is\r\nentire security unless the ephippiger can move, turn, and get on its\r\nfeet, and that one condition is admirably guarded against.\r\n\r\nBut with several, all in the same degree of paralysis, there would be\r\ngreat risk for the larva. Though there would be nothing to fear from\r\nthe first insect attacked, as the larva is out of its reach, there\r\nwould be peril from the neighbourhood of the others, which in\r\nstretching out their legs hither and thither might strike it and tear\r\nit up with their spurs. Perhaps this is why S. flavipennis, which heaps\r\nthree or four grasshoppers in one cell, almost entirely paralyses them,\r\nwhile S. occitanica, providing each burrow with a single victim, leaves\r\ngreat power of motion to the ephippiger, simply preventing change of\r\nplace or rising to its feet, thus—though I cannot affirm it—economising\r\ndagger thrusts.\r\n\r\nIf the half-paralysed ephippiger be harmless for the larva established\r\non a point of its body where defence is impossible, things are\r\notherwise for the Sphex itself, which has to get it home. First, the\r\nprey clutches bits of grass with its tarsi as it is dragged along,\r\nbeing still able to use them pretty freely, causing considerable\r\ndifficulty in getting it onward. The Sphex, heavily weighted by her\r\nload, is exposed to exhaustion by her efforts to make her prey let go\r\nits desperate hold on grassy places. But that is the least of the\r\ndifficulties; it has full use of its mandibles, which snap and bite\r\nwith their old vigour. Just in front of these terrible pincers is the\r\nslender body of the spoiler, as the latter draws the victim along. The\r\nantennæ are grasped not far from their root, so that the ephippiger,\r\nlying on its back, has its mouth now opposite the abdomen, and now the\r\nthorax of the Sphex, who, standing high on her long legs, watches, I am\r\nconvinced, in order not to be seized by the mandibles gaping beneath. A\r\nmoment of forgetfulness, a slip, a mere nothing, might bring her within\r\nreach of a pair of strong nippers which would not let slip the chance\r\nof a pitiless vengeance. In certain specially difficult cases, if not\r\nalways, the movement of these redoubtable pincers must be stopped, and\r\nthe harpoon-like tarsi prevented from adding to the difficulties of\r\ntransport.\r\n\r\nWhat will the Sphex do to obtain this result? Man, and even a learned\r\nman, would hesitate, bewilder himself with vain attempts, and perhaps\r\ndespair of success. Let him come and take a lesson from the Sphex, who,\r\nwithout having learned, without ever seeing any one else at work, is\r\nthoroughly up in her profession of operator. She knows that under her\r\nvictim’s skull lies a circlet of nerve-knots, somewhat analogous to the\r\nbrain of higher animals. She knows too that this chief nerve centre\r\ndirects the action of the mouth-parts, and, moreover, is the seat of\r\nwill, without whose command no muscle acts; finally, she is aware that\r\nif this kind of brain be injured, all resistance will cease, the insect\r\nno longer possessing will-power. As for the method of operation, it is\r\nthe easiest thing possible for her, and when we have studied at her\r\nschool we may try in our turn. The sting is no longer employed; in her\r\nwisdom the Sphex decides compression to be preferable to the poisoned\r\nsting. Let us bow to her decision, for we shall presently see how\r\nprudent it is to be convinced of our ignorance compared with the\r\nanimal’s knowledge. Lest by re-writing my account I fail to do justice\r\nto the sublime talent of this masterly operation, I transcribe my notes\r\nwritten on the spot directly after witnessing the exciting spectacle.\r\n\r\nThe Sphex, finding that her prey resists too much, hooking itself here\r\nand there to blades of grass, pauses to perform the singular operation\r\nabout to be described—a kind of coup de grâce. The Hymenopteron, still\r\nastride her victim, makes the articulation in the upper part of the\r\nneck, at the nape, to open wide. Then she seizes the neck with her\r\nmandibles, groping as far forward as possible under the skull, but\r\nmaking no outward wound, grasps and chews repeatedly the nerve-centres\r\nof the head. This renders her victim quite motionless, and incapable of\r\nthe least resistance, whereas previously the feet, though unable to\r\nmove in the manner necessary for walking, vigorously resisted being\r\ndragged along. This is the fact in all its eloquence. While leaving\r\nintact the thin, supple membrane of the neck, the insect finds a way\r\ninto the skull with the point of its mandibles, and bruises the brain.\r\nThere is neither effusion of blood nor wound, but merely external\r\ncompression. Of course I kept the paralysed ephippiger under inspection\r\nin order to watch the consequences of the operation at my leisure, and\r\nequally of course I hastened to repeat on living specimens what the\r\nSphex had taught me. I will now compare my results with hers.\r\n\r\nTwo ephippigers, whose cervical ganglia I compressed with pincers, fell\r\nquickly into a state like that of her victims, only they sounded their\r\nharsh cymbals if irritated by the point of a needle, and their feet\r\nmade some irregular languid movements. The difference in the results\r\nobtained doubtless arises from the fact that my victim had not been\r\npreviously stung in the thoracic ganglia, as those had been which the\r\nSphex had struck in the breast. Allowing for this important point, it\r\nwill be seen that I made no bad pupil, and imitated my teacher in\r\nphysiology, the Sphex, not ill. I own that it was not without a certain\r\nsatisfaction that I found I had done almost as well as the insect does.\r\n\r\nAs well! What have I just said? Wait a little, and it will be seen that\r\nI had to attend the Sphex’s school for many another day. For my two\r\nephippigers speedily died—died outright, and after three or four days I\r\nhad only decaying bodies under my eyes. But the ephippiger of the\r\nSphex? Need I say that ten days after the operation this was perfectly\r\nfresh, as it has to be for the larva whose destined prey it is. Yet\r\nmore, a few hours after the operation under the skull, there reappeared\r\nas if nothing had happened movements of an irregular kind in feet,\r\nantennæ, palpi, ovipositor, and mandibles—in short, the creature was\r\nagain in the same state as before the Sphex bit its brain. And the\r\nmovements went on, only feebler each day. The Sphex had only benumbed\r\nher victim for a period amply sufficient to enable her to get it home\r\nwithout resistance, while I, who thought myself her rival, was but a\r\nclumsy, barbarous butcher, and killed mine. She, with her inimitable\r\ndexterity, compressed the brain scientifically to cause a lethargy of a\r\nfew hours; I, brutal through ignorance, perhaps crushed this delicate\r\norgan, primal source of life, with my pincers. If anything could\r\nprevent my blushing at my defeat, it would be that few if any could\r\nrival the Sphex in skill.\r\n\r\nAh! now I comprehend why she did not use her sting to injure the\r\nganglia of the neck. A drop of poison instilled here, at the centre of\r\nvital force, would annihilate all nerve power, and death would soon\r\nfollow. But the Sphex does not at all desire death. Dead food by no\r\nmeans suits the larvæ, and still less a body smelling of decay. All\r\nthat is needed is lethargy, a passing torpor, hindering resistance\r\nwhile the victim is carted along—resistance difficult to overcome and\r\ndangerous to the Sphex. This torpor is obtained by the proceeding known\r\nin laboratories of experimental science as compression of the brain.\r\nThe Sphex acts like a Flourens who, baring an animal’s brain and\r\npressing on the cerebrum, abolishes at once sensibility, will,\r\nintelligence, and motion. The pressure ceases and all reappears. So\r\nreappear the remains of life in the ephippiger as the lethargic effects\r\nof a skilful pressure go off. The ganglia of the skull, squeezed by the\r\nmandibles, but without mortal contusions, gradually recover activity,\r\nand put an end to the general torpor. It is alarmingly scientific!\r\n\r\nFortune has her entomological caprices; you run after her and do not\r\ncome up with her; you forget her, and lo, here she is tapping at your\r\ndoor! How many useless excursions, how many fruitless plans, you made\r\nto try to see Sphex occitanica sacrifice her victim! Twenty years go\r\nby; these pages are already in the printer’s hands, when, in the first\r\ndays of this month (August 8, 1878), my son Emile darts into my study.\r\n“Quick! quick!” he cries, “a Sphex is dragging along her prey under the\r\nplane trees, before the door of the court!” Emile, initiated into the\r\naffair by what I had told him, and, better still, by like facts seen in\r\nour out-of-door life, was quite right. I hurried away, and saw a\r\nsplendid S. occitanica dragging a paralysed ephippiger by the antennæ.\r\nShe moved toward the poultry yard, seemingly desirous of scaling the\r\nwall, to make her burrow under some roof tile. Some years before I had\r\nseen a similar Sphex accomplish the ascent with her game, and choose\r\nher domicile under the arch of an ill-joined tile. Perhaps this new one\r\nwas descended from her whose difficult ascent I have chronicled. A like\r\nfeat is probably about to be repeated, and this time before numerous\r\nwitnesses, for all the household working under the shade of the plane\r\ntrees formed a circle round the Sphex. They wonder at the audacious\r\ntameness of the insect, noways disturbed by the gallery of interested\r\nspectators. All are struck by her proud and robust bearing, as, with\r\nraised head and the victim’s antennæ well grasped by her mandibles, she\r\ndrags after her the enormous burden. I alone among the spectators feel\r\nsome regret. “Ah, had I but some live ephippigers!” I could not help\r\nsaying, without the least hope of seeing my wish realised. “Live\r\nephippigers!” replied Emile; “why, I have some quite fresh, caught this\r\nmorning.” Four steps at a time he flew upstairs to his little study,\r\nwhere barricades of dictionaries enclosed a park wherein was brought up\r\na fine caterpillar of Sphinx euphorbiæ. He brought back three\r\nephippigers as good as heart could wish—two females and one male. How\r\ncame these insects at hand just at the right moment for an experiment\r\nvainly tried twenty years before? This is another story. A southern\r\nshrike had nested on one of the tall plane trees in the avenue. Some\r\ndays before the Mistral, the rude wind of our parts, had blown so\r\nviolently that branches bent as well as reeds, and the nest overturned\r\nby the undulations of its branch let fall the four nestlings it\r\ncontained. The next day I found the brood on the ground—three killed by\r\nthe fall, the fourth still alive. The survivor was entrusted to Emile,\r\nwho thrice a day went cricket-hunting on the turf in the neighbourhood\r\nto feed his charge. But crickets are not very large, while the\r\nnestling’s appetite was. Something else was preferred—ephippigers,\r\ncollected from time to time on the dry stalks and prickly leaves of the\r\nEryngium. The three insects brought me by Emile came from the shrike’s\r\nlarder. My pity for the fallen nestlings had brought me this\r\nunhoped-for good luck.\r\n\r\nHaving made the circle of spectators draw back and leave free passage\r\nfor the Sphex, I took away her prey with my pincers, giving her\r\nimmediately in exchange one of my ephippigers with an ovipositor like\r\nthat of the one abstracted. Stamping was the only sign of impatience\r\nshown by the bereaved Hymenopteron. She ran at the new prey, too\r\ncorpulent to try to avoid pursuit, seized it with her mandibles by the\r\nsaddle-shaped corslet, got astride, and curving her abdomen, passed its\r\nend under the ephippiger’s thorax. There doubtless the stings are\r\ngiven, but the difficulty of observation prevents me from telling how\r\nmany. The ephippiger—gentle victim—lets itself be operated on\r\nunresistingly, like the dull sheep of our slaughter-houses. The Sphex\r\ntakes her time and manœuvres her lancet with a deliberation favourable\r\nto the observer; but the prey touches the ground with the whole lower\r\npart of its body, and what happens there cannot be seen. As for\r\ninterfering and lifting the ephippiger a little so as to see better, it\r\nis not to be thought of; the murderess would sheath her weapon and\r\nretire. The next act is easy to observe. After having stabbed the\r\nthorax, the end of the abdomen appears under the neck, which she forces\r\nwidely open by pressing the nape. Here the sting enters with marked\r\npersistence, as if more effective than elsewhere. One might suppose\r\nthat the nerve centre struck was the lower part of the œsophagean\r\ncollar, but the persistence of movement in the mouthpieces, mandibles,\r\njaws, and palpi, animated by this source of nerve power, shows that\r\nthis is not so. Through the neck the Sphex simply reaches the thoracic\r\nganglia, or at least the first, more easily attainable through the thin\r\nskin of the neck than through the integuments of the chest.\r\n\r\nAll is over. Without one convulsion or sign of pain the ephippiger is\r\nrendered henceforward an inert mass. For the second time I deprived the\r\nSphex of the subject operated on, replacing it by the second female at\r\nmy disposal. The same manœuvres were followed by the same result. Three\r\ntimes, almost without a pause, the Sphex repeated her skilled surgery,\r\nfirst on her own capture, then on those exchanged by me. Will she do so\r\na fourth time on the male which I still have? It is doubtful, not that\r\nshe is weary, but because the game does not suit her. I have never seen\r\na Sphex with any but female prey, which, filled as they are with eggs,\r\nare the favourite food of the larvæ. My suspicion was well founded.\r\nDeprived of her third capture, she obstinately refused the male which I\r\noffered her. She ran hither and thither with hurried steps, seeking her\r\nlost prey. Three or four times she approached the ephippiger, walked\r\nround it, cast a disdainful glance at it, and finally flew away. This\r\nwas not what her larvæ  wanted. Experiment reiterated it after twenty\r\nyears’ interval.\r\n\r\nThe three females, two stabbed under my eyes, remained mine. All the\r\nfeet were quite paralysed, Whether in its natural position or on its\r\nback or side, the creature retains whichever is given it. Constant\r\noscillations of the antennæ, and, at intervals, some pulsations of the\r\nstomach and movements of the mouthpieces, are the only sign of life.\r\nMotion is destroyed but not feeling, for at the least prick where the\r\nskin is thin, the whole body shudders faintly. Perhaps one day\r\nphysiology will discover in these victims a subject for fine studies on\r\nthe functions of the nervous system. The Hymenopteron’s sting,\r\nincomparably skilful in reaching a given point and inflicting a wound\r\nto affect it alone, will replace, with immense advantage, the brutal\r\nscalpel of the experimenter, which disembowels where it should lightly\r\ntouch. Meanwhile, here are the results obtained from the three victims,\r\nbut from another point of view.\r\n\r\nOnly movement of the feet being destroyed, there being no injury save\r\nthat to the nerve centres, the source of motion, the creature perishes,\r\nnot from its wound, but from inanition. The experiment was tried thus:\r\n\r\nTwo uninjured ephippigers found in the fields were imprisoned without\r\nfood, one in the dark, the other in the light. In four days the latter\r\ndied of hunger, in five the former. This difference of a day is easily\r\nexplained. In the light the creature is more eager to recover liberty,\r\nand as every movement of the animal machine causes a corresponding\r\nexpenditure of energy, greater activity used up sooner the reserves of\r\nthe organisation. With light, more agitation and shorter life; in\r\ndarkness, less movement and longer life; both insects fasted equally.\r\nOne of the three stabbed was kept in the dark and foodless. In this\r\ncase there was not only darkness and want of food, but the serious\r\nwounds inflicted by the Sphex, and yet for seventeen days it\r\nperpetually moved its antennæ. As long as this kind of pendulum\r\noscillates, the clock of life has not stopped. On the eighteenth day\r\nthe creature ceased to wave its antennæ and died. Thus the seriously\r\nwounded insect lived in the same conditions as the uninjured one four\r\ntimes as long. What seems as if it should be a cause of death is really\r\nthe cause of life.\r\n\r\nHowever paradoxical it may at first appear, this result is perfectly\r\nsimple. Intact, the creature agitates and spends itself; paralysed, it\r\nmakes only those feeble, internal movements, inseparable from all\r\norganised life, and the waste of substance is in proportion to the\r\namount of action employed. In the first case the animal machine works\r\nand spends itself; in the second it is at rest and saves itself up.\r\nNourishment no longer repairing loss, the insect in motion spends in\r\nfour days its food reserves and dies; the motionless one does not spend\r\nthem, and lives eighteen. Physiology tells us that life is continual\r\ndestruction, and the Sphex’s victims are a most elegant demonstration\r\nof this fact.\r\n\r\nOne more remark. Fresh food is absolutely necessary to larvæ  of the\r\nHymenopteron. If the prey were stored intact, in four or five days it\r\nwould be a dead body, given up to decay, and the newly hatched grubs\r\nwould find no food but a corrupted mass. Touched by the sting it can\r\nlive two or three weeks—a period more than sufficient for the egg to\r\nhatch and the grub to develop. The paralysis has thus a double\r\nresult—immobility, so as not to endanger the life of the delicate\r\nlarvæ, and long preservation of the flesh to assure wholesome\r\nnourishment for them. Even when enlightened by science human logic\r\ncould find nothing better.\r\n\r\nMy two other ephippigers, stung by the Sphex, were kept in darkness\r\nwith food. To feed inert creatures, differing only from dead bodies by\r\nthe perpetual oscillation of their long antennæ, seems at first an\r\nimpossibility; however, the play of the mouth organs gave me some hope,\r\nand I made the attempt. My success surpassed my expectations. There was\r\nno question, of course, of offering them a lettuce leaf or any other\r\ngreen thing on which they might have browsed in their normal condition;\r\nthey were feeble invalids, to be nourished with a feeding-cup, so to\r\nsay, and broth. I used sugar and water.\r\n\r\nThe insect being laid on its back, I put a drop of sugared liquid on\r\nits mouth with a straw. Instantly the palpi stirred, mandibles and jaws\r\nmoved; the drop was consumed with evident satisfaction, especially if\r\nthe fast had been somewhat prolonged. I renewed the dose till it was\r\nrefused. The repast took place once or twice a day at irregular\r\nintervals, as I could not devote myself very much to a hospital of this\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nWell, with this meagre diet one of the ephippigers lived twenty-one\r\ndays. This was little longer than the life of the one which I allowed\r\nto die of inanition. It is true that twice the insect had had a bad\r\nfall, having dropped from the experiment table to the floor through\r\nsome awkwardness of mine. The bruises consequent may have hastened its\r\nend. As for the other, exempt from accidents, it lived six weeks. As\r\nthe nourishment offered, sugar and water, could not indefinitely\r\nreplace the natural food, it is very probable that it would have lived\r\nlonger still had its customary diet been available. Thus the point\r\nwhich I had in view is demonstrated: victims pierced by the sting of\r\nthe Hymenopteron die from inanition and not of their wound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nTHE IGNORANCE OF INSTINCT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sphex has just shown us with what infallible, transcendent art she\r\nacts, guided by the unconscious inspiration of instinct: she will now\r\nshow how poor she is in resources, how limited in intelligence, and\r\neven illogical in cases somewhat out of her usual line. By a strange\r\ncontradiction, characteristic of the instinctive faculties, with deep\r\nscience is associated ignorance not less deep. Nothing is impossible to\r\ninstinct, however great be the difficulty. In constructing her\r\nhexagonal cells with their floor of three lozenge-shaped pieces, the\r\nbee resolves, with absolute precision, the arduous problems of maximum\r\nand minimum, to solve which man would need a powerful, mathematical\r\nmind. Hymenoptera, whose larvæ  live on prey, have methods in their\r\nmurderous art hardly equalled by those of a man versed in the most\r\ndelicate mysteries of anatomy and physiology. Nothing is difficult to\r\ninstinct so long as the action moves in the unchanging groove allotted\r\nto the animal, but, again, nothing is easy to instinct if the action\r\ndeviates from it. The very insect which amazes us and alarms us by its\r\nhigh intelligence will, a moment later, astonish us by its stupidity\r\nbefore some fact extremely simple, but strange to its usual habits. The\r\nSphex will offer an example.\r\n\r\nLet us follow her dragging home an ephippiger. If fortune favour us, we\r\nmay be present at a little scene which I will describe. On entering the\r\nshelter under a rock where the burrow is made, the Sphex finds, perched\r\non a blade of grass, a carnivorous insect which, under a most\r\nsanctimonious aspect, hides the morals of a cannibal. The danger\r\nthreatened by this bandit in ambush on her path must be known to the\r\nSphex, for she leaves her game and runs bravely at the Mantis to\r\nadminister some sharp blows and dislodge, or at all events, alarm and\r\ninspire it with respect. It does not move, but closes its deadly\r\nweapons—the two terrible saws of the arm and forearm. The Sphex returns\r\nto her prey, harnesses herself to the antennæ, and passes audaciously\r\nunder the blade of grass where the Mantis sits. From the direction of\r\nher head one can see that she is on her guard, and is holding the enemy\r\nmotionless under her threatening eyes. Such courage is duly rewarded;\r\nthe prey is stored without further misadventure.\r\n\r\nA word more of the Praying Mantis, the Prégo Diéou as it is called in\r\nProvence, i.e. the Pray-to-God. And, indeed, its long, pale green\r\nwings, like ample veils, its head upraised to heaven, its arms folded\r\nand crossed on its breast, give it a false resemblance to a nun in\r\necstatic devotion. All the same, it is a ferocious creature, bent on\r\ncarnage. Although not especially favourite hunting-grounds, the\r\nworkshops of various burrowing Hymenoptera are often visited by it.\r\nPosted on some bush near the burrows, it waits until chance brings some\r\nSphex returning home within reach, thus achieving a double capture,\r\ncatching together Sphex and prey. Its patience is long tried; the Sphex\r\nis suspicious and on her guard, but from time to time a rash one lets\r\nherself be caught. By a sudden rustle of half-spread wings, as by a\r\nconvulsive movement, the Mantis terrifies the approaching Sphex, which\r\nhesitates for a moment, and then with the suddenness of a spring the\r\ntoothed forearm folds back on an arm also toothed, and the insect is\r\nseized between the blades of the double saw, as though the jaws of a\r\nwolf trap were closing on the beast as it takes the bait. Then, without\r\nunclosing the cruel machine, the Mantis gnaws little mouthfuls of its\r\nvictim. Such are the ecstasies, the prayers, and the mystic meditations\r\nof the Prégo Diéou.\r\n\r\nAmong the scenes of carnage which the Mantis has left in my memory, let\r\nme describe the following. It passes before a working-place of\r\nPhilanthus apivorus. These miners nourish their larvæ with hive-bees,\r\nwhich they seize on flowers while collecting pollen and honey. If the\r\nPhilanthus feels that the bee is full of honey, it does not fail to\r\nsqueeze it before storing it, either on the way, or at the entrance of\r\nthe hole, to make it disgorge the delicious liquid; this it drinks by\r\nlicking the tongue of the unfortunate bee, which, dying, extends it at\r\nfull length. This profanation of a dying creature, squeezed by its\r\nmurderer to empty its body and enjoy the contents, has something so\r\nhideous that I should call it a crime if a Philanthus could be held\r\nresponsible. In the midst of this horrible banquet I have seen both\r\nmurderer and prey seized by the Mantis; the robber was plundered by a\r\nsecond robber. Horrible to relate, while the Mantis held it\r\ntranspierced by the points of the double saw, and was already gnawing\r\nthe under parts, the Philanthus went on licking the honey, unable to\r\nabandon the delicious food even in the throes of death. Let us cast a\r\nveil over these horrors.\r\n\r\nWe return to the Sphex, with whose burrow we must make acquaintance\r\nbefore going further. It is made of fine sand, or rather in the fine\r\ndust at the bottom of a natural shelter. Its passage is very short—an\r\ninch or two without a turn, leading into a single spacious oval\r\nchamber, and all is a rude, hastily made den, rather than a dwelling\r\nhollowed with art and leisure. I have already said that the captured\r\nprey, left for a brief moment or two where it was hunted, is the cause\r\nof the simplicity of this abode and of there being but one chamber or\r\ncell to each hollow. For who can say whither the chances of the day’s\r\nhunt may lead? The dwelling must be near the heavy prey, and to-day’s\r\nabode, too far off to admit of carrying the second ephippiger there,\r\ncannot be used to-morrow. Thus each time prey is caught there must be\r\nnew digging out—a new burrow with its one cell, now here, now there.\r\nNow let us try some experiments to see how the insect behaves amid\r\ncircumstances new to it.\r\n\r\nFirst experiment.—A Sphex, dragging her prey, is at a few inches from\r\nher burrow. Without disturbing her I cut the antennæ of the ephippiger,\r\nwhich we already know serve as harness. Having recovered from her\r\nastonishment at the sudden lightening of her load, the Sphex returns\r\nand unhesitatingly seizes the base of the antennæ, the short stumps not\r\ncut off. Very short they are—hardly a millimetre long; no matter, they\r\nsuffice for the Sphex, who grips what remains of her ropes and drags\r\nanew. With many precautions not to hurt her, I cut off the two stumps,\r\nnow level with the skull. Finding nothing to seize at the parts\r\nfamiliar to her, she takes hold on one side of one of the long palpi of\r\nher victim, and drags it, not at all put out by this modification in\r\nher style of harnessing herself. I leave her alone. The prey is got\r\nhome and placed with its head to the mouth of the burrow. The Sphex\r\nenters to make a short inspection of the interior before proceeding to\r\nstore provisions. Her tactics recall those of S. flavipennis in like\r\ncircumstances. I profit by this brief moment to take the abandoned\r\nprey, deprive it of all its palpi, and place it a little farther off—a\r\npace from the burrow. The Sphex reappears and goes straight to her\r\ngame, which she saw from her threshold. She seeks above the head, she\r\nseeks below, on one side, and finds nothing to seize. A desperate\r\nattempt is made; opening wide her mandibles she tries to grasp the\r\nephippiger by the head, but her pincers cannot surround anything so\r\nlarge, and slip off the round, polished skull. She tries several times\r\nin vain; at length, convinced of the futility of her efforts, draws\r\nback, and seems to renounce further attempts. She appears\r\ndiscouraged—at least she smooths her wings with her hind feet, while\r\nwith her front tarsi, first passing them through her mouth, she washes\r\nher eyes, a sign among Hymenoptera, as I believe, that they give a\r\nthing up.\r\n\r\nYet there were points by which the ephippiger might be seized and\r\ndragged as easily as by the antennæ and palpi. There are the six feet,\r\nthere is the ovipositor—all organs slender enough to be thoroughly\r\ngrasped and used as traction ropes. I own that the easiest way of\r\ngetting the prey into the storehouse is to introduce it head first by\r\nthe antennæ; yet, drawn by one foot, especially a front one, it would\r\nenter almost as easily, for the orifice is wide and the passage short,\r\neven if there be one. How came it then that the Sphex never once tried\r\nto seize one of the six tarsi or the point of the ovipositor, while she\r\ndid make the impossible, absurd attempt to grip with mandibles far too\r\nshort the huge head of her prey? Perhaps the idea did not occur to her.\r\nLet us try to suggest it. I place under her mandibles first a foot,\r\nthen the end of the abdominal sabre. She refuses obstinately to bite;\r\nmy repeated solicitations come to nothing. A very odd kind of hunter\r\nthis to be so embarrassed by her game and unable to think of seizing it\r\nby a foot if it cannot be taken by the horns! Perhaps my presence and\r\nall these unusual events may have troubled her faculties; let us leave\r\nher to herself, with her burrow and ephippiger, and give her time to\r\nconsider and to imagine in the calm of solitude some means of managing\r\nthe business. I walked away and returned in a couple of hours to find\r\nthe Sphex gone, the burrow open, and the ephippiger where I had laid\r\nit. The conclusion is that the Sphex tried nothing, but departed,\r\nabandoning home, game—everything, when to utilise them all that was\r\nneeded would have been to take the prey by one foot. Thus this rival of\r\nFlourens, who just now startled us by her science when pressing the\r\nbrain to induce lethargy, is invariably dull when the least unusual\r\nevent occurs. The Sphex, which knows so well how to reach the thoracic\r\nganglia of a victim with her sting, and those of the brain with her\r\nmandibles, and which makes such a judicious difference between a\r\npoisoned sting that would destroy the vital influence of the nerves,\r\nand compression causing only momentary torpor, cannot seize her prey in\r\na new way. To understand that a foot may be taken instead of the\r\nantennæ is impossible; nothing will do but the antennæ or another\r\nfilament of the head or one of the palpi. For want of these ropes her\r\nwhole race would perish, unable to surmount this trifling difficulty.\r\n\r\nSecond experiment.—The Sphex is busy closing her burrow where the prey\r\nis stored and the egg laid. With her fore tarsi she sweeps backward\r\nbefore her door, and launches from the entrance a spurt of dust, which\r\npasses beneath her, and springs up behind in a parabolic curve as\r\ncontinuous as if it were a slender stream of some liquid, so rapidly\r\ndoes she sweep. From time to time she chooses some sand grains with her\r\nmandibles, strengthening materials inserted singly in the dusty mass.\r\nTo consolidate this she beats it with her head, and heaps it with her\r\nmandibles. Walled up by this masonry, the entrance rapidly disappears.\r\nIn the midst of the work I intervene. Having put the Sphex aside I\r\nclear out the short gallery carefully with the blade of a knife, take\r\naway the materials which block it, and entirely restore the\r\ncommunication of the cell with the outer air. Then, without injuring\r\nthe edifice, I draw the ephippiger out of the cell where it is lying\r\nwith its head to the far end, and its ovipositor to the entrance. The\r\negg is as usual on its breast, near the base of one of the hind legs—a\r\nproof that the Sphex had given her last touch to the burrow, and would\r\nnever return. These dispositions made, and the ephippiger placed safely\r\nin a box, I gave up my place to the Sphex, who had been watching while\r\nher domicile was rifled. Finding the entrance open, she entered and\r\nremained some moments, then came forth and took up her work where I\r\ninterrupted it, beginning to stop the entrance conscientiously,\r\nsweeping the dust backward, and transporting sand grains to build them\r\nwith minute care, as if doing a useful work. The orifice being again\r\nthoroughly blocked, she brushed herself, seemed to give a glance of\r\nsatisfaction at her work, and finally flew off.\r\n\r\nYet she must have known that the burrow was empty, since she had gone\r\ninside, and made prolonged stay, but yet after this visit to the\r\nplundered dwelling, she set to work to close it with as much care as if\r\nnothing had happened. Did she propose to turn it later to account,\r\nreturning with a fresh prey, and laying a new egg? In that case the\r\nburrow was closed to defend it from indiscreet visitors while the Sphex\r\nwas away. Or it was a measure of prudence against other miners who\r\nmight covet a ready-made chamber, or a wise precaution against internal\r\nwear and tear, and, in fact, some predatory Hymenoptera are careful\r\nwhen obliged to suspend work to defend the mouth of their burrow by\r\nclosing it up temporarily. I have seen certain Ammophilæ, whose burrow\r\nis a vertical well, close the entrance with a little flat stone when\r\nthe insect goes a-hunting, or stops mining when the hour to leave off\r\nwork comes at sunset. But in that case the stoppage is slight—a mere\r\nslab set on the top of the well. It takes but a moment when the insect\r\ncomes to displace the little flat stone, and the door is open. But what\r\nwe have just seen the Sphex construct is a solid barrier—strong\r\nmasonry, where layers of alternate dust and gravel occupy the whole\r\npassage. It is definitive, and no temporary work, as is sufficiently\r\nshown by the careful way in which it is constructed. Besides, as I\r\nthink I have already proved, it is very doubtful, considering the\r\nmanner in which she acted, whether the Sphex would return to use the\r\ndwelling which she had prepared. A new ephippiger will be caught\r\nelsewhere, and elsewhere too will the storehouse destined for it be\r\nhollowed. As, however, these are but conclusions drawn by reasoning,\r\nlet us consult experiment, more conclusive here than logic. I let\r\nnearly a week pass in order to allow the Sphex to return to the burrow\r\nso methodically closed, and use it if she liked for her nest-laying.\r\nEvents answered to the logical deduction; the burrow was just as I had\r\nleft it, well closed, but without food, egg, or larva. The\r\ndemonstration was decisive; the Sphex had not returned.\r\n\r\nThus we see the plundered Sphex go into her house, pay a leisurely\r\nvisit to the empty chamber, and the next moment behave as if she had\r\nnot perceived the absence of the big prey which a little while before\r\nhad encumbered the cell. Did she not realise the absence of food and\r\negg? Was she really so dull—she, so clear-sighted when playing the\r\nmurderer—that the cell was empty? I dare not accuse her of such\r\nstupidity. She did perceive it. But why then that other piece of\r\nstupidity which made her close, and very conscientiously too, an empty\r\nchamber which she did not mean to store? It was useless—downright\r\nabsurd—to do this, and yet she worked with as much zeal as if the\r\nfuture of the larva depended on it. The various instinctive actions of\r\ninsects are then necessarily connected; since one thing has been done,\r\nsuch another must inevitably follow to complete the first, or prepare\r\nthe way for the next, and the two acts are so necessarily linked that\r\nthe first must cause the second, even when by some chance this last has\r\nbecome not only superfluous, but sometimes contrary to the creature’s\r\ninterest. What object could there be in stopping a burrow now useless,\r\nsince it no longer contained prey and egg, and which will remain\r\nuseless, since the Sphex will not return to it? One can only explain\r\nthis irrational proceeding by regarding it as the necessary consequence\r\nof preceding actions. In the normal state of things the Sphex hunts her\r\nprey, lays an egg, and closes the hole. The prey has been caught, the\r\negg laid, and now comes the closing of the burrow, and the insect\r\ncloses it without reflecting at all, or guessing the fruitlessness of\r\nher labour.\r\n\r\nThird experiment.—To know all and nothing, according as the conditions\r\nare normal or otherwise, is the strange antithesis presented by the\r\ninsect. Other examples drawn from the Sphegidæ will confirm us in this\r\nproposition. Sphex albisecta attacks middle-sized Acridians, the\r\nvarious species scattered in the neighbourhood of her burrow all\r\nfurnishing a tribute. From the abundance of these Acrididæ the chase is\r\ncarried on near at hand. When the vertical well-like burrow is ready,\r\nthe Sphex merely flies over the ground near, and espies an Acridian\r\nfeeding in the sunshine. To pounce and sting while it struggles is done\r\nin a moment. After some fluttering of the wings, which unfold like\r\ncarmine or azure fans, some moving of feet up and down, the victim\r\nbecomes motionless. Next it must be got home by the Sphex on foot. She\r\nperforms this toilsome operation as do her kindred, dragging her game\r\nbetween her feet, and holding one of the antennæ in her mandibles. If a\r\ngrass thicket has to be traversed, she hops and flutters from blade to\r\nblade, keeping firm hold of her prey. When within a few feet of her\r\ndwelling she executes the same manœuvre as does S. occitanica, but\r\nwithout attaching the same importance to it, for sometimes she neglects\r\nit. The game is left on the road, and though no apparent danger\r\nthreatens the dwelling, she hurries toward its mouth, and puts in her\r\nhead repeatedly, or even partly enters, then returns to the Acridian,\r\nbrings it nearer, and again leaves it to revisit her burrow, and so on\r\nseveral times, always with eager haste.\r\n\r\nThese repeated visits have sometimes annoying results. The victim,\r\nrashly abandoned on a slope, rolls to the bottom, and when the Sphex\r\nreturns and does not find it where she left it, she must hunt for it,\r\nsometimes in vain. If found, there will be a difficult climb, which,\r\nhowever, does not prevent her leaving it once more on the perilous\r\nslope. The first of these repeated visits to her cell is easily\r\nexplained. Before bringing her heavy load she is anxious to make sure\r\nthat the entrance is clear, and that nothing will hinder her carrying\r\nin the prey. But what is the use of her other visits, repeated so\r\nspeedily one after another? Are the Sphex’s ideas so unstable that she\r\nforgets the one just made, and hurries back a moment later, only to\r\nforget that she has done so, and so on? It would indeed be a slippery\r\nmemory where impressions vanished as soon as made. Let us leave this\r\ntoo obscure question.\r\n\r\nAt length the game is brought to the edge of the well, its antennæ\r\nhanging into the mouth, and there is an exact repetition of the method\r\nused by S. flavipennis, and, though in less striking conditions, by S.\r\noccitanica. She enters alone, reappears at the entrance, seizes the\r\nantennæ, and drags in the Acridian. While she was within I have pushed\r\nthe prey rather farther off, and have always obtained precisely the\r\nsame result as in the case of the huntress of crickets. In both\r\nSphegidæ there was the same persistence in plunging into their burrows\r\nbefore dragging down their prey. We must recollect that S. flavipennis\r\ndoes not always allow herself to be duped by my trick of withdrawing\r\nthe insect. There are elect tribes among them,—strong-minded\r\nfamilies,—who after a while find out the tricks of the experimenter,\r\nand know how to baffle them. But these revolutionaries capable of\r\nprogress are the few; the rest, rigid conservatives in manners and\r\ncustoms, are the majority, the crowd. I cannot say whether the hunters\r\nof Acrididæ show more or less cunning in different districts.\r\n\r\nBut the most remarkable thing, and the one to which I want specially to\r\ncome, is this. After withdrawing the prey of S. albisecta several times\r\nfrom the mouth of the hole, and obliging her to fetch it back, I\r\nprofited by her descent to the bottom of her den to seize and put the\r\nprey where she could not find it. She came up, sought about for a long\r\ntime, and, when quite convinced that it was not to be found, went down\r\nagain. A few moments later she reappeared. Was it to return to the\r\nchase? Not the least in the world; she began to close the hole, and\r\nwith no temporary cover, such as a small flat stone to mark the\r\norifice, but with a solid mass of carefully collected dust and gravel\r\nswept into the passage until it was quite filled. S. albisecta only\r\nmakes a single cell at the bottom of her well, and puts in but one\r\nvictim. This one specimen had been caught and dragged to the edge of\r\nthe hole, and if it was not stored, that was my fault, not her’s. The\r\nSphex worked by an inflexible rule, and according to that rule she\r\ncompleted the work by stopping up the hole even if empty. Here we have\r\nan exact repetition of the useless labour of S. occitanica whose\r\ndwelling I rifled.\r\n\r\nFourth experiment.—It is almost impossible to be certain whether S.\r\nflavipennis, which makes several calls at the bottom of the same\r\npassage, and heaps several grasshoppers in each, commits the same\r\nirrational mistakes when accidentally disturbed. A cell may be closed,\r\nalthough empty or imperfectly stored, and yet the Sphex will return to\r\nthe same burrow to make others. Yet I have reason to believe that this\r\nSphex is subject to the same aberrations as her two relations. The\r\nfacts on which I base my belief are these. When the work is completed,\r\nthere are generally four grasshoppers in each cell, but it is not\r\nuncommon to find three or only two. Four appears to me the usual\r\nnumber—first, because it is the most frequent, and secondly, when I\r\nhave brought up young larvæ dug up when eating their first grasshopper,\r\nI found that all, even those only provided with two or three, easily\r\nfinished those offered, up to four, but after that they hardly touched\r\nthe fifth ration. If four grasshoppers are required by the larva to\r\ndevelop fully, why is it sometimes only provided with three or even\r\nonly two? Why this immense difference in the amount of food? It cannot\r\nbe from any difference in the joints served up, since all are\r\nunmistakably of the same size, but must come from losing prey on the\r\nroad. In fact, one finds at the foot of the slopes whose upper parts\r\nare occupied by Sphegidæ, grasshoppers killed, and then lost down the\r\nincline, when, for some reason or other, the Sphex has momentarily left\r\nthem. These grasshoppers become the prey of ants and flies, and the\r\nSphex who finds them takes good care not to pick them up, as they would\r\ntake enemies into the burrow.\r\n\r\nThese facts seem to demonstrate that if S. flavipennis can compute\r\nexactly how many victims to catch, she cannot attain to counting how\r\nmany reach their destination, as if the creature had no other guide as\r\nto number than an irresistible impulse leading her to seek game a fixed\r\nnumber of times. When this number of journeys has been made,—when the\r\nSphex has done all that is possible to store the captured prey,—her\r\nwork is done, and the cell is closed, whether completely provisioned or\r\nnot. Nature has endowed her with only those faculties called for under\r\nordinary circumstances by the interests of the larva, and these blind\r\nfaculties, unmodified by experience, being sufficient for the\r\npreservation of the race, the animal cannot go farther.\r\n\r\nI end then as I began: instinct knows everything in the unchanging\r\npaths laid out for it; beyond them it is entirely ignorant. The sublime\r\ninspirations of science, the astonishing inconsistencies of stupidity,\r\nare both its portion, according as the creature acts under normal\r\nconditions or under accidental ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nAN ASCENT OF MONT VENTOUX\r\n\r\n\r\nBy its isolation, which leaves it freely exposed on every side to the\r\ninfluence of atmospheric agencies, and from the height which makes it\r\nthe culminating point of France on this side of the frontiers of Alps\r\nor Pyrenees, the bare Provençal mountain, Mont Ventoux, lends itself\r\nremarkably to studies of plant species according to climate. At the\r\nbase flourish the tender olive and that crowd of small semi-woody\r\nplants whose aromatic scent requires the sun of southern regions. On\r\nthe summit, where snow lies at least half the year, the ground is\r\ncovered with a northern flora, partly borrowed from the arctic regions.\r\nHalf a day’s journey in a vertical line brings before one’s eyes a\r\nsuccession of the chief vegetable types met with in the same meridian\r\nin long travels from south to north. When you start your feet crush the\r\nperfumed thyme which forms a continuous carpet on the lower slopes;\r\nsome hours later they tread the dusky cushions of Saxifraga\r\noppositifolia, the first plant seen by a botanist who lands in July on\r\nthe shores of Spitzbergen. In the hedges below you had gathered the\r\nscarlet blossoms of the pomegranate, which loves an African sky; up\r\nabove you find a hairy little poppy sheltering its stalks under a\r\ncovering of small stony fragments, and which opens its large yellow\r\ncorolla in the icy solitudes of Greenland and the North Cape, just as\r\nit does on the highest slopes of Ventoux.\r\n\r\nSuch contrasts have always a new charm, and twenty-five ascents have\r\nnot yet brought me satiety. In August 1865 I undertook the\r\ntwenty-third. We were eight persons—three who came to botanise, five\r\nattracted by a mountain expedition and the panorama of the heights.\r\nNone of those who were not botanists have ever again desired to\r\naccompany me. In truth, the expedition is a rough one, and a sunrise\r\ndoes not atone for the fatigue endured.\r\n\r\nThe best comparison for Mont Ventoux is that of a heap of stones broken\r\nup to mend the roads. Raise this heap steeply up to two kilometres, and\r\ngive it a base in proportion, cast on the white of its limestone the\r\nblackness of forests, and you get a clear idea of the general look of\r\nthe mountain. This heap of débris—sometimes little chips, sometimes\r\nhuge masses of rock—rises from the plain without preliminary slopes or\r\nsuccessive terraces to render ascent less trying by dividing it into\r\nstages. The climb begins at once, by rocky paths, the best of which is\r\nnot as good as a road newly laid with stones, and rising ever rougher\r\nand rougher to the summit, a height of 1912 metres. Fresh lawns, glad\r\nrivulets, the ample shade of ancient trees—all that gives such a charm\r\nto other mountains is here unknown, replaced by an endless bed of\r\ncalcareous rock broken into scales which yield under one’s feet with a\r\nsharp, almost metallic sound. For cascades Mont Ventoux has streams of\r\nstones, the sound of which, as they roll downward, replaces the murmur\r\nof falling water.\r\n\r\nWe have reached Bedoin, at the foot of the mountain, arrangements with\r\nthe guide are completed, the hour of departure is settled, provisions\r\nchosen and prepared. Let us try to sleep, for the next night will be a\r\nsleepless one on the mountain. But to fall asleep was the difficulty; I\r\nhave never achieved it, and this is the chief cause of fatigue. I would\r\ntherefore advise any readers who propose to botanise on Mont Ventoux\r\nnot to arrive at Bedoin on a Sunday night. They will thus avoid the\r\nbustle of a country inn, endless conversations at the top of the\r\nspeakers’ voices, the echo of billiard balls, the clinking of glasses,\r\nwith the drinking-songs, the nocturnal couplets of passers-by, the\r\nbellowing of wind instruments at the neighbouring ball, and the other\r\ntribulations inseparable from this holy day of rest and enjoyment.\r\nCould one sleep there on other nights? I hope so, but cannot answer for\r\nit. I never closed an eye. All night long the rusty spit, labouring for\r\nour benefit, groaned under my bedroom; only a thin plank separated me\r\nfrom that diabolical machine.\r\n\r\nBut already the sky was growing light; a donkey brayed under the\r\nwindows; the hour had come to rise, and we might as well not have gone\r\nto bed at all. Provisions and baggage were loaded, our guide cried “Ja!\r\nhi!” and we set off. At the head of the caravan walked Triboulet with\r\nhis mule and ass—Triboulet, the eldest and chief of the Ventoux guides.\r\nMy botanical colleagues scrutinised the vegetation on either side of\r\nthe road by the early light; the others talked. I followed the party, a\r\nbarometer slung over my shoulder, a note-book and pencil in my hand.\r\n\r\nMy barometer, intended for ascertaining the height of the chief\r\nbotanical stations, soon became a pretext for attacks on the gourd of\r\nrum. “Quick, the barometer!” some one would exclaim every time that a\r\nremarkable plant was pointed out, and we would all press round the\r\ngourd, the barometer coming later. The freshness of the morning and our\r\nwalk made us appreciate these references to the barometer so much that\r\nthe level of the tonic liquid lowered even faster than that of the\r\ncolumn of mercury. For the future it would be wise to consult\r\nTorricelli’s tube less frequently.\r\n\r\nThe temperature grew colder; olive and ilex disappear, next vine and\r\nalmond, then mulberry, walnut, and white oak; box grows plentiful. We\r\nenter on a monotonous region, stretching from the limit of cultivation\r\nto the lower edge of the beech woods, where the chief plant is Satureia\r\nmontana, known here as pébré d’asé,—asses’ pepper,—from the acrid smell\r\nof its small leaves, impregnated with essential oil. Certain little\r\ncheeses which form part of our provisions are powdered with this strong\r\nspice, and more than one of us casts a famishing glance at the\r\nprovision bags carried by the mule. Our rough, early expedition had\r\nbrought an appetite, nay, better still, a devouring hunger, “latrantem\r\nstomachum,” as Horace wrote. I showed my companions how to still this\r\nhunger until we came to our next halt, pointing out a little sorrel\r\nwith arrow-shaped leaves, springing among the loose stones, and to set\r\nan example I gathered a mouthful. There was a laugh at the notion. I\r\nlet them laugh, and soon saw one busier than another gathering the\r\nprecious sorrel.\r\n\r\nWhile chewing the acid leaves we came to the beeches, first large\r\nsolitary bushes, sweeping the ground, then dwarf trees, close together,\r\nthen strong trunks, forming a thick dark forest whose soil is a chaos\r\nof limestone blocks. Overloaded in winter by snow, beaten all the year\r\nround by fierce gusts of the Mistral, many are branchless, twisted into\r\nstrange shapes, or even prostrate. An hour or more was passed in\r\ntraversing the wooded zone, which, seen from a distance, looked like a\r\nblack girdle on the sides of the mountain. Now again the beeches became\r\nstunted and scattered; we had reached their upper limit, and, despite\r\nthe sorrel, all were right glad to come to the spot chosen for our halt\r\nand breakfast.\r\n\r\nWe were at the fountain of La Grave, a slender thread of water caught,\r\nas it issues from the ground, in a line of long troughs made of beech\r\ntrunks, where the mountain shepherds water their flocks. The\r\ntemperature of the spring was 7 degrees Cent.—a freshness inestimable\r\nfor us who came up from the sultry heat of the plain. The cloth was\r\nspread over a charming carpet of Alpine plants, among which glittered\r\nthe thyme-leaved Paronychia, whose large thin bracts are like silver\r\nscales. The provisions are taken out of their bags, the bottles out of\r\ntheir bed of hay. On this side are the solid dishes, legs of mutton\r\nstuffed with garlic, and piles of bread; there the insipid chickens,\r\ngood to amuse one’s grinders when serious hunger has been appeased. Not\r\nfar off, in a place of honour, are the Ventoux cheeses sprinkled with\r\nasses’ pepper, and hard by Arles sausages, whose pink flesh is marbled\r\nwith squares of bacon and whole pepper. In this corner are green olives\r\nstill dripping with pickle, and black ones seasoned with oil. In\r\nanother are melons from Cavaillon, some white, some orange, to suit all\r\ntastes, and there a pot of anchovies which make a man drink hard and be\r\ntireless on the march, and finally the bottles, cooling in the icy\r\nwater of a trough. Is nothing forgotten? Yes, we have not mentioned the\r\ncrown of the feast, raw onions eaten with salt. Our two Parisians, for\r\nthere are two among us, my fellow botanists, are at first taken\r\nsomewhat aback by this decidedly bracing bill of fare. They will be the\r\nfirst, a little later, to break forth in its praise. All is ready. Let\r\nus to table! Then began one of those homeric meals which make an epoch\r\nin one’s life. The first mouthfuls have a touch of frenzy. Slices of\r\nleg of mutton and bread succeed one another with alarming rapidity.\r\nEach of us, without communicating his apprehensions, casts an anxious\r\nlook on the provender, and says inwardly, “If we go on at this rate,\r\nwill there be enough for this evening and to-morrow?” However, the\r\ncraving abated: first we devoured silently, then we ate and talked;\r\nfears for the next day abated too; we did justice to him who ordered\r\nthe bill of fare, and who, foreseeing our voracity, arranged to meet it\r\nworthily. Now came the time to appreciate the provisions as\r\nconnoisseurs; one praises the olives, stabbing them singly with the\r\npoint of his knife; another lauds the anchovies as he cuts up the\r\nlittle yellow-ochre fish on his bread; a third speaks enthusiastically\r\nof the sausages; and one and all agree in praising the asses’-pepper\r\ncheeses, no bigger than the palm of one’s hand. Pipes and cigars are\r\nlighted, and we lie on our backs in the sun upon the grass.\r\n\r\nAfter an hour’s rest it is, “Up! time presses; we must go on!” The\r\nguide and luggage were to go westward, along the wood, where there is a\r\nmule path. He will wait for us at Jas or Bâtiment, at the upper limit\r\nof the beeches, some 1550 metres above the sea. The Jas is a large\r\nstone, but capable of sheltering man and beast at night. We were to go\r\nupward to the crest which we should follow so as to reach the highest\r\npart more easily. After sunset we would go down to the Jas, where the\r\nguide would have long arrived; such was the plan proposed and adopted.\r\n\r\nWe have reached the crest. Southward extend, as far as eye can see, the\r\ncomparatively easy slopes by which we ascended on the north. The scene\r\nis savagely grand, the mountain sometimes perpendicular, sometimes\r\nfalling in frightfully steep terraces, little less than a precipice of\r\n1500 metres. Throw a stone, and it never stops till, bound after bound,\r\nit reaches the valley where one can see the bed of the Toulourenc wind\r\nlike a ribbon. While my companions moved masses of rock and sent them\r\nrolling into the gulf that they might watch the terrible descent, I\r\ndiscovered under a big stone an old acquaintance in the entomological\r\nworld—Ammophila hirsuta, which I had always found isolated on banks\r\nalong roads in the plain, while here, on the top of Mont Ventoux, were\r\nseveral hundreds heaped under the same shelter. I was trying to find\r\nthe cause of this agglomeration, when the southern breeze, which had\r\nalready made us anxious in the course of the morning, suddenly brought\r\nup a bevy of clouds melting into rain. Before we had noticed them a\r\nthick rain-fog wrapped us round, and we could not see a couple of paces\r\nbefore us. Most unluckily one of us, my excellent friend, Th. Delacour,\r\nhad wandered away looking for Euphorbia saxatilis, one of the botanical\r\ncuriosities of these heights. Making a speaking trumpet of our hands we\r\nall shouted together. No one replied. Our voices were lost in the dense\r\nfog and dull sound of the wind in the whirling mass of cloud. Well,\r\nsince the wanderer cannot hear us we must seek him. In the darkness of\r\nthe mist it was impossible to see one another two or three paces off,\r\nand I alone of the seven knew the locality. In order to leave no one\r\nbehind, we took each other’s hands, I placing myself at the head of the\r\nline. For some minutes we played a game of blindman’s buff, which led\r\nto nothing. Doubtless, on seeing the clouds coming up, Delacour, well\r\nused to Ventoux, had taken advantage of the last gleams of light to\r\nhurry to the shelter of Jas. We also must hurry there, for already the\r\nrain was running down inside our clothes as well as outside, and our\r\nthin white trousers clung like a second skin. A grave difficulty met\r\nus: our turnings and goings and comings while we searched had reduced\r\nme to the condition of one whose eyes have been bandaged, and has then\r\nbeen made to pirouette on his heels. I had lost the points of the\r\ncompass, and no longer knew in the very least which was the southern\r\nside. I questioned one and another; opinions were divided and very\r\nuncertain. The conclusion was that not one of us could say which was\r\nthe north and which the south. Never—no, never have I realised the\r\nvalue of the points of the compass as at that moment. All around was\r\nthe unknown of gray cloudland; below we could just make out the\r\nbeginning of a slope here or there, but which was the right one? We\r\nmust make up our minds to descend, trusting to good fortune. If by ill\r\nluck we took the northern slope we risked breaking our necks over those\r\nprecipices the very look of which had so inspired us with fear. Perhaps\r\nnot one of us would survive. I went through some moments of acute\r\nperplexity.\r\n\r\n“Let us stay here,” said the majority, and wait till the rain stops.\r\n“Bad advice,” said the others, and I was of the number; “bad advice.\r\nThe rain may last a long while, and drenched as we are, at the first\r\nchill of night we shall freeze on the spot.” My worthy friend, Bernard\r\nVerlot, come from the Jardin des Plantes at Paris on purpose to ascend\r\nMont Ventoux with me, showed an imperturbable calm, trusting to my\r\nprudence to get out of the scrape. I drew him a little on one side so\r\nas not to increase the panic of the others, and told him my terrible\r\napprehensions. We held a council of two, and tried to supply the place\r\nof the magnetic needle by reasoning. “When the clouds came up,” said I,\r\n“was it not from the south?” “Certainly from the south.” “And though\r\nthe wind was hardly perceptible, the rain slanted slightly from south\r\nto north?” “Yes, I noticed that until I got bewildered. Is not that\r\nsomething to guide us? Let us descend on the side whence the rain\r\ncomes.” “I had thought of that, but felt doubtful; the wind was too\r\nlight to have a clearly defined direction. It might be a revolving\r\ncurrent such as are produced on a mountain top surrounded by cloud.\r\nNothing assures me that the first direction has been continuous, and\r\nthat the current of air does not come from the north.” “And in that\r\ncase?” “Ah! there is the crux! I have an idea! If the wind has not\r\nchanged, we ought to be wettest on the left side, since the rain came\r\non that side till we lost our bearings. If it has changed we must be\r\npretty equally wet all round. We must feel and decide. Will that do?”\r\n“It will.” “And if I am mistaken?” “You will not be mistaken.”\r\n\r\nIn two words the matter was explained to our friends. Each felt\r\nhimself, not outside, which would not have been sufficient, but under\r\nhis innermost garment, and it was with unspeakable relief that I heard\r\none and all announce the left side much wetter than the right. The wind\r\nhad not changed. Very good, let us turn toward the rainy quarter. The\r\nchain was formed again, Verlot as rearguard, to leave no straggler\r\nbehind. Before starting, I said once more to my friend, “Shall we risk\r\nit?” “Risk it; I follow you,” and we plunged into the awful unknown.\r\n\r\nTwenty of those strides which one cannot moderate on a steep slope, and\r\nall fear was over. Under our feet was not empty space but the\r\nlonged-for ground covered with stones which gave way and rolled down\r\nbehind us in streams. To one and all this rattle denoting terra firma\r\nwas heavenly music. In a few minutes we reached the upper fringe of\r\nbeeches. Here the gloom was yet deeper than on the mountain top; one\r\nhad to stoop to the ground to see where one was setting foot. How in\r\nthe midst of this darkness were we to find the Jas, buried in the depth\r\nof the wood? Two plants which always follow man, Good King Henry\r\n(Chenopodium Bonus Henricus) and the nettle, served me as a clue. I\r\nswept my free hand through the air as I walked, and at each sting I\r\nknew there was a nettle and an indication. Verlot, our rearguard, made\r\nsimilar lunges, and supplied the want of sight by the burning stings.\r\nOur companions showed no faith in this style of research. They talked\r\nof continuing the wild descent and of returning if necessary to Bedoin.\r\nMore confident in the botanical instinct so keen in himself also,\r\nVerlot joined with me in persisting in our search, reassuring the most\r\ndemoralised, and showing that it was possible by questioning plants\r\nwith our hands to reach our destination in the darkness. They yielded\r\nto our reasoning, and shortly after, from one clump of nettles to\r\nanother, the party arrived at the Jas.\r\n\r\nDelacour was there, as well as the guide with the baggage, sheltered in\r\ngood time from the rain. A blazing fire and change of garments soon\r\nrestored our usual cheerfulness. A block of snow, brought from the\r\nneighbouring valley, was hung in a bag before the hearth. A bottle\r\ncaught the melted water. This would be our fountain for the evening\r\nmeal. The night was spent on a bed of beech leaves, well crushed by our\r\npredecessors, and they were many. Who knows for how many years the\r\nmattress had never been renewed? Now it was a hard-beaten mass. The\r\nmission of those who could not sleep was to keep up the fire. Hands\r\nwere not wanting to stir it, for the smoke, with no other exit than a\r\nlarge hole made by the partial falling in of the roof, filled the hut\r\nwith an atmosphere made to smoke herrings. To get a mouthful of\r\nbreathable air one must seek it with one’s nose nearly level with the\r\nground. There was coughing; there was strong language, and stirring of\r\nthe fire; but vain was every attempt to sleep. By 2 a.m. we were all on\r\nfoot to climb the highest cone and behold the sunrise. The rain was\r\nover, the sky splendid, auguring a radiant day.\r\n\r\nDuring the ascent some of us felt a kind of sea-sickness, caused partly\r\nby fatigue and partly by the rarefaction of the air. The barometer sank\r\n140 millimetres; the air we breathed had lost one-fifth of its density,\r\nand was consequently one-fifth poorer in oxygen. By those in good\r\ncondition this slight modification would pass unnoticed, but, added to\r\nthe fatigue of the previous day and to want of sleep, it increased our\r\ndiscomfort. We mounted slowly, our legs aching, our breathing\r\ndifficult. Every twenty steps or so one had to halt. At last the summit\r\nwas gained. We took refuge in the rustic chapel of St. Croix to take\r\nbreath and counteract the biting cold by a pull at the gourd, which\r\nthis time we emptied. Soon the sun rose. To the farthest limit of the\r\nhorizon Mont Ventoux projected its triangular shadow, tinted violet\r\nfrom the effect of the diffracted rays. Southward and westward\r\nstretched misty plains, where, when the sun rose higher, one would\r\ndistinguish the Rhône as a silver thread. On the north and east an\r\nenormous cloud-bed spreads under our feet like a sea of cotton wool,\r\nwhence the dark tops of the lower mountains rise as if they were islets\r\nof scoriæ, while others with their glaciers shine glorious on the side\r\nwhere the Alps uplift their chain of mountains.\r\n\r\nBut botany calls, and we must tear ourselves from this magic spectacle.\r\nAugust, the month when we made our ascent, is somewhat late; many\r\nplants were out of blossom. Those who really want to be successful\r\nshould come up here in the first fortnight of July, and, above all,\r\nshould forestall the arrival of the herds and flocks on these heights.\r\nWhere a sheep has browsed one finds but poor remains. As yet spared by\r\nthe grazing flocks, the stony screes on the top of Mont Ventoux are in\r\nJuly literally a bed of flowers. Memory calls up the lovely dew-bathed\r\ntufts of Androsace villosa, with white flowers and rosy centres; Viola\r\ncenisia, opening great blue corollas on the shattered heaps of\r\nlimestone; Valeriana saliunca, with perfumed blossoms, but roots that\r\nsmell like dung; Globularia cordifolia, forming close carpets of a\r\ncrude green, starred with little blue heads; Alpine forget-me-not, blue\r\nas the sky above it; the iberis of Candolle, whose slender stalk bears\r\na dense head of tiny white flowers and creeps down among the loose\r\nstones; Saxifraga oppositifolia and S. muscoides, both making dark\r\nthick little cushions, the former with purple blossoms, the latter with\r\nwhite, washed with yellow. When the sun is hotter one sees a splendid\r\nbutterfly flutter from one blossomed tuft to another, its white wings\r\nmarked by four patches of vivid rose-carmine encircled with black. It\r\nis Parnassius apollo, the graceful dweller in Alpine solitudes, near\r\nthe eternal snows. Its caterpillar lives on saxifrages. With the Apollo\r\nlet us end this sketch of the joys which await the naturalist on the\r\ntop of Mont Ventoux and return to the Ammophila hirsuta, crouching in\r\ngreat numbers under a sheltering stone, when the rain came up and\r\nsurrounded us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nTHE EMIGRANTS\r\n\r\n\r\nI have already told how on the top of Mont Ventoux, some 6000 feet\r\nabove the sea, I had one of those pieces of entomological good luck,\r\nwhich would be fruitful indeed did they but occur often enough to allow\r\nof continuous study. Unhappily mine is a unique observation, and I\r\ndespair of repeating it. Future observers must replace my probabilities\r\nby certainties. I can only found conjectures on it.\r\n\r\nUnder the shelter of a large flat stone I discovered some hundreds of\r\nAmmophila hirsuta, heaped in a mass almost as compact as a swarm of\r\nbees. As soon as the stone was lifted all the small people began to\r\nmove about, but without any attempt to take wing. I moved whole\r\nhandfuls, but not one seemed inclined to leave the heap. Common\r\ninterests appeared to unite them indissolubly. Not one would go unless\r\nall went. With all possible care I examined the flat stone which\r\nsheltered them, as well as the soil and immediate neighbourhood, but\r\ncould discover no explanation of this strange assemblage. Finding\r\nnothing better to do, I tried to count them, and then came the clouds\r\nto end my observations and plunge us into that perplexing darkness I\r\nhave already described. At the first drops of rain I hastened to put\r\nback the stone and replace the Ammophila people under shelter. I give\r\nmyself a good mark, as I hope the reader also will, for having taken\r\nthe precaution of not leaving the poor things, disturbed by my\r\ncuriosity, exposed to the downpour.\r\n\r\nAmmophila hirsuta is not rare in the plain, but is always found singly\r\non the edge of a road or on sandy slopes, now digging a well, now\r\ndragging a heavy prey. It is solitary, like Sphex occitanica, and I was\r\ngreatly surprised by finding such a number gathered under one stone at\r\nthe top of Mont Ventoux. Instead of my solitary acquaintance, here was\r\na great assembly. Let us try to educe the probable causes of this\r\nagglomeration. By an exception very rare among mining Hymenoptera,\r\nAmmophila hirsuta builds in the first days of spring. Toward the end of\r\nMarch, if the season be mild, or at least in the first fortnight of\r\nApril, when the grasshoppers take their adult form, and painfully cast\r\noff their first skin on their thresholds,—when Narcissus poeticus\r\nexpands its first flowers, and the bunting utters its long-drawn note\r\nfrom the top of the poplars in the meadow,—Ammophila hirsuta sets to\r\nwork to hollow and provision a home for her larvæ, whereas other\r\nspecies and the predatory Hymenoptera in general undertake this labour\r\nonly in autumn, during September and October. This very early\r\nnidification, preceding by six months the date adopted by the immense\r\nmajority, at once suggests certain considerations. One asks if those\r\nfound burrowing so early in April are really insects of that year—i.e.\r\nwhether these spring workers completed their metamorphosis and came out\r\nof their cocoons during the preceding three months. The general rule is\r\nthat the Fossor becomes a perfect insect, leaves its burrow, and\r\noccupies itself with its larvæ all in one season. It is in June and\r\nJuly that the greater part of the hunting Hymenoptera come from the\r\ngalleries where they lived as larvæ, and in August, September, and\r\nOctober they follow their occupations as burrowers and hunters.\r\n\r\nDoes a similar law apply to Ammophila hirsuta? Does the same season\r\nwitness the final transformation and the labours of the insect? It is\r\nvery doubtful, for the Hymenoptera, occupied with mining at the end of\r\nMarch, would have to complete their metamorphosis and break forth from\r\nthe cocoon in winter, or at latest in February. The severity of the\r\nclimate at that date forbids any such conclusion. It is not when the\r\nbitter Mistral howls for a fortnight at a time and freezes the ground,\r\nnor when snow-storms follow its icy breath, that the delicate\r\ntransformations of the nymph state can take place, and the perfect\r\ninsect venture to quit the shelter of its cocoon. It needs the soft\r\ndampness of earth under a summer sun before it can leave its cell.\r\n\r\nIf I did but know the exact date at which Ammophila hirsuta leaves the\r\ncocoon it would greatly help me; but, to my deep regret, I do not. My\r\nnotes, gathered day by day, show the confusion inseparable from\r\nresearches that are generally dealing with points that cannot be\r\nforeseen, and are silent on this point, whose importance I fully\r\nrealise now that I want to arrange my materials in order to write these\r\nlines. I find mention of the Ammophila of the sands coming out of the\r\negg on June 5, and A. argentata on the 20th; but I have nothing in my\r\narchives regarding the hatching of A. hirsuta. It is a detail left\r\nunnoticed through forgetfulness. The dates for the two other species\r\naccord with the general law, the perfect insect appearing at the hot\r\ntime of year. By analogy I fix the same date for the coming forth of A.\r\nhirsuta from the cocoon.\r\n\r\nWhence, then, come those which one sees at work on their burrows at the\r\nend of March and April? We must conclude that they were hatched in the\r\nprevious year and emerged from their cells at the usual time in June\r\nand July, lived through the winter, and began to build as soon as\r\nspring came. In a word, they are insects that hibernate. Experience\r\nfully confirms this conclusion.\r\n\r\nDo but search patiently in a vertical bank of earth or sand well\r\nexposed to the sun, especially where generations of the various\r\nhoney-gathering Hymenoptera have followed one another year after year,\r\nriddling the ground with a labyrinth of passages till it looks like a\r\nhuge sponge, you are nearly sure to see in the heart of winter A.\r\nhirsuta either alone or in little parties of three or four, crouched in\r\nsome warm retreat, waiting inactive till summer shall come. This\r\ncheering little meeting, amid the gloom and cold of winter, with the\r\ngraceful insect which at the first notes of the bunting and the cricket\r\nenlivens the grassy paths, is one that I have been able to enjoy at\r\nwill. If the weather be calm and the sun has a little power, the chilly\r\ninsect comes out to bask on its threshold, luxuriating in the hottest\r\nbeams, or it will venture timidly outside and walk slowly over the\r\nspongy bank, brushing its wings. So, too, does the little gray lizard,\r\nwhen the sun begins to warm the old wall which is its home.\r\n\r\nBut vainly would one seek in winter, even in the most sheltered spots,\r\nfor a Cerceris, Sphex, Philanthus, Bembex, and other Hymenoptera with\r\ncarnivorous larvæ. All died after their autumn labours, and their race\r\nis only represented by the larvæ benumbed down in their cells. Thus, by\r\na very rare exception, Ammophila hirsuta, hatched in the hot season,\r\npasses the following winter in some warm refuge, and this is why it\r\nappears so early in the year.\r\n\r\nWith these data let us try to explain the Ammophila swarm on the crest\r\nof Mont Ventoux. What could these numerous Hymenoptera under their\r\nsheltering stone have been about? Were they meaning to take up winter\r\nquarters there and await under their flat stone, benumbed, the season\r\npropitious to their labours? Everything points to the improbability of\r\nthis. It is not in August, at the time of the greatest heat, that an\r\nanimal is overcome with winter sleep. Want of their food—the honey\r\njuice sucked from flowers—cannot be suggested. September showers will\r\nsoon come, and vegetation, suspended for a while by the heat of the dog\r\ndays, will assume new vigour and cover the fields with a flowery carpet\r\nalmost as varied as that of spring. This period—one of enjoyment for\r\nmost of the Hymenoptera—cannot possibly be one of torpor for A.\r\nhirsuta. Again, can one suppose that the heights of Ventoux, swept by\r\nthe gusty Mistral, uprooting beech and pine,—summits where the bise\r\nwhirls about the snow for six months of the year,—crests wrapped for\r\nthe greater part of the year by cold clouds and mist,—can be adopted as\r\na winter refuge by such a sun-loving insect? One might as well make it\r\nhibernate among the ice fields of the North Cape! No, it is not there\r\nthat A. hirsuta must pass the cold season. The group observed there\r\nwere making a temporary halt. At the first indication of rain, which,\r\nthough it escaped us, could not escape the insect so eminently\r\nsensitive to the variations of the atmosphere, the wayfarers had taken\r\nrefuge under a stone, and were waiting for the rain to pass before they\r\nresumed their flight. Whence came they? Where were they going?\r\n\r\nIn this same month of August, and especially in September, there come\r\nto the warm olive region flocks of little migratory birds; descending\r\nby stages from the lands where they have loved,—fresher, more wooded,\r\nmore peaceful lands than ours,—where they have brought up their broods.\r\nThey come almost to a day in an invariable order, as if guided by the\r\ndates of an almanac known only to themselves. They sojourn for a while\r\nin our plains, where abound the insects which are the chief food of\r\nmost of them; they visit every clod in our fields where the ploughshare\r\nhas turned up innumerable worms in the furrows, and feast on them, and\r\nwith this diet they speedily lay on fat,—a storehouse and reserve to\r\nserve as nutrition against toils to come, and thus well provided for\r\nthe journey they go on southward, to reach winterless lands where\r\ninsects are always to be found, such as Spain and Southern Italy, the\r\nisles of the Mediterranean and Africa. This is the season for the\r\npleasure of shooting and for succulent roasts of small birds.\r\n\r\nThe Calandrelle, or Crèou, as Provence calls it, is the first to\r\narrive. As soon as August has begun it may be seen exploring the stony\r\nfields, seeking the seeds of the Setaria, an ill weed affecting\r\ncultivated ground. At the least alarm it flies off, making a harsh\r\nguttural sound sufficiently expressed by its Provençal name. It is soon\r\nfollowed by the whinchat, which preys quietly on small weevils,\r\ncrickets, and ants in old fields of luzern. With the whinchat begins\r\nthe long line of small birds suitable for the spit. It is continued in\r\nSeptember by the most celebrated of them—the common wheat-ear,\r\nglorified by all who are capable of appreciating its high qualities.\r\nNever did the Beccafico of the Roman gourmet, immortalised in Martial’s\r\nepigrams, rival the delicious, perfumed ball of fat the wheat-ear makes\r\nwhen it has grown scandalously obese on an immoderate diet. It consumes\r\nevery kind of insect voraciously. My archives as a sportsman-naturalist\r\ngive a list of the contents of its gizzard. All the small people of the\r\nfallows are in it,—larvæ and weevils of every kind, crickets,\r\nchrysomelides, grasshoppers, cassidides, earwigs, ants, spiders,\r\nhundred-legs, snails, wire-worms, and ever so many more. And as a\r\nchange from this spicy diet there are grapes, blackberries, and\r\ncornel-berries. Such is the bill of fare sought incessantly by the\r\nwheat-ear as it flutters from clod to clod, the white feathers of its\r\noutspread tail giving it the look of a butterfly on the wing. Heaven\r\nonly knows to what amount of fat it can attain.\r\n\r\nOnly one other bird surpasses it in the art of fattening itself, and\r\nthat is its fellow emigrant,—another voracious devourer of insects,—the\r\nbush pipit as it is absurdly styled by those who name birds, while the\r\ndullest of our shepherds never hesitate to call it Le Grasset, i.e. the\r\nfattest of the fat. The name is sufficient to point out its leading\r\ncharacteristic. Never another bird attains such a degree of obesity. A\r\nmoment arrives when, loaded all over with fat, it becomes like a small\r\npat of butter. The unfortunate bird can hardly flutter from one\r\nmulberry tree to another, panting in the thick foliage, half choked\r\nwith melting fat, a victim to his love of weevil.\r\n\r\nOctober brings the slender gray wagtail, pied ash colour and white,\r\nwith a large black velvet gorget. The charming bird, running and\r\nwagging its tail, follows the ploughman almost under the horses’ feet,\r\npicking up insects in the newly turned furrow. About the same time\r\ncomes the lark,—first in little companies thrown out as scouts, then in\r\ncountless bands which take possession of cornfield and fallow, where\r\nabounds their usual food, the seeds of the Setaria. Then on the plain,\r\namid the sparkle of dewdrops and frost crystals suspended to each blade\r\nof grass, a mirror shoots intermittent flashes under the morning sun.\r\nThen the little owl, driven from shelter by the sportsman, makes its\r\nshort flight, alights, stands upright with sudden starts and rolling of\r\nalarmed eyes, and the lark comes with a dipping flight, anxious for a\r\nclose inspection of the bright thing or the odd bird. There it is, some\r\nfifteen paces away—its feet hanging, its wings outspread like a\r\nsaint-esprit. The moment has come; aim and fire. I hope that my readers\r\nmay experience the emotions of this delightful sport.\r\n\r\nWith the lark, and often in the same flocks, comes the titlark—the\r\nsisi—another word giving the bird’s little call. None rushes more\r\nvehemently upon the owl, round and round which it circles and hovers\r\nincessantly. This may suffice as a review of the birds which visit us.\r\nMost of them make it only a halting-place, staying for a few weeks,\r\nattracted by the abundance of food, especially of insects; then,\r\nstrengthened and plump, off they go. A few take up winter quarters in\r\nour plains, where snow is very rare, and there are countless little\r\nseeds to be picked up even in the heart of the cold season. The lark\r\nwhich searches wheat fields and fallows is one; another is the titlark,\r\nwhich prefers fields of luzern and meadows.\r\n\r\nThe skylark, so common in almost every part of France, does not nest in\r\nthe plains of Vaucluse, where it is replaced by the crested lark—friend\r\nof the highway and of the road-mender. But it is not necessary to go\r\nfar north to find the favourite places for its broods; the next\r\ndepartment, the Drôme, is rich in its nests. Very probably, therefore,\r\namong the flocks of larks which take possession of our plains for all\r\nautumn and winter many come from no farther than the Drôme. They need\r\nonly migrate into the next department to find plains that know not\r\nsnow, and a certainty of little seeds.\r\n\r\nA like migration to a short distance seems to me to have caused the\r\nassemblage of Ammophila on the top of Mont Ventoux. I have proved that\r\nthis insect spends the winter in the perfect state, sheltering\r\nsomewhere and awaiting April to build its nest. Like the lark it must\r\ntake precautions against the cold season; though capable of fasting\r\ntill flowers return, the chilly thing must find protection against the\r\ndeadly attacks of the cold. It must flee snowy districts, where the\r\nsoil is deeply frozen, and, gathering in troops like migrant birds,\r\ncross hill and dale to seek a home in old walls and banks warmed by a\r\nsouthern sun. When the cold is gone, all or part of the band will\r\nreturn whence they came. This would explain the assemblage on Mont\r\nVentoux. It was a migrant tribe, which, on its way from the cold land\r\nof the Drôme to descend into the warm plains of the olive, had to cross\r\nthe deep, wide valley of the Toulourenc, and, surprised by the rain,\r\nhalted on the mountain top. Apparently A. hirsuta has to migrate to\r\nescape winter cold. When the small migratory birds set out in flocks,\r\nit too must journey from a cold district to a neighbouring one which is\r\nwarmer. Some valleys crossed, some mountains overpassed, and it finds\r\nthe climate sought.\r\n\r\nI have two other instances of extraordinary insect gatherings at great\r\nheights. I have seen the chapel on Mont Ventoux covered with\r\nseven-spotted ladybirds, as they are popularly called. These insects\r\nclung to the stone of walls and pavement so close together that the\r\nrude building looked, at a few paces off, like an object made of coral\r\nbeads. I should not dare to say how many myriads were assembled there.\r\nCertainly it was not food which had attracted these eaters of Aphidæ to\r\nthe top of Mont Ventoux, some 6000 feet high. Vegetation is too\r\nscanty—never Aphis ventured up there.\r\n\r\nAnother time, in June, on the tableland of St. Amand, at a height of\r\n734 mètres, I saw a similar gathering, only less numerous. At the most\r\nprojecting part of the tableland, on the edge of an escarpment of\r\nperpendicular rocks, rises a cross with a pedestal of hewn stone. On\r\nevery side of this pedestal, and on the rocks serving as its base, the\r\nvery same beetle, the seven-spotted ladybird of Mont Ventoux, was\r\ngathered in legions. They were mostly quite still, but wherever the\r\nsunbeams struck there was a continuous exchange of place between the\r\nnewcomers, who wanted to find room, and those resting, who took wing\r\nonly to return after a short flight. Neither here any more than on the\r\ntop of Mont Ventoux was there anything to explain the cause of these\r\nstrange assemblages on arid spots without Aphidæ and noways attractive\r\nto Coccinellidæ,—nothing which could suggest the secret of these\r\npopulous gatherings upon masonry standing at so great an elevation.\r\n\r\nHave we here two examples of insect migration? Can there be a general\r\nmeeting such as swallows hold before the day of their common departure?\r\nWere these rendezvous whence the cloud of ladybirds were to seek some\r\ndistrict richer in food? It may be so, but it is very extraordinary.\r\nThe ladybird has never been talked of for her love of travel. She seems\r\na home-loving creature enough when we see her slaying the green-fly on\r\nrose trees, and black-fly on beans, and yet with her short wings she\r\nmounts to the top of Ventoux and holds a general assembly where the\r\nswallow herself only ascends in her wildest flights. Why these\r\ngatherings at such heights? Why this liking for blocks of masonry?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nTHE AMMOPHILA\r\n\r\n\r\nA slender waist, a slim shape, an abdomen much compressed at the upper\r\npart, and seemingly attached to the body by a mere thread, a black robe\r\nwith a red scarf on its under parts,—such is the description of these\r\nFossors; like Sphegidæ in form and colouring, but very different in\r\nhabits. The Sphegidæ hunt Orthoptera, crickets, ephippigers, and\r\ngrasshoppers, while the Ammophila chases caterpillars. This difference\r\nof prey at once suggests new methods in the murderous tactics of\r\ninstinct.\r\n\r\nDid not the name sound pleasant to the ear, I should be inclined to\r\nquarrel with Ammophila, which means sand-lover, as being too exclusive\r\nand often erroneous. The true lovers of sand—dry, powdery, and slippery\r\nsand—are the Bembex, which prey on flies: but the caterpillar-hunters,\r\nwhose history I am about to tell, have no liking for pure, loose sand,\r\nand even avoid it as being too subject to landslips which may be caused\r\nby a mere trifle. Their vertical pits, which must remain open until the\r\ncell is stored with food and an egg, require more solid materials if\r\nthey are not to be blocked prematurely. What they want is a light soil,\r\neasy to mine, where the sandy element is cemented by a little clay and\r\nlime. The edges of paths—slopes of thin grass exposed to the sun,—such\r\nare the places they favour. In spring, from the first days of April,\r\none sees Ammophila hirsuta there; in September and October there are A.\r\nsabulosa, A. argentata, and A. holosericea. I will make an abstract of\r\nthe notes furnished by these four species.\r\n\r\nFor all four the burrow is a vertical shaft, a kind of well, with at\r\nmost the dimension of a large goose quill, and about two inches deep.\r\nAt the bottom is a single cell, formed by a simple widening of the\r\nshaft. To sum up, it is a poor dwelling, obtained at small expense, at\r\none sitting, affording no protection if the larva had not four wrappers\r\nin its cocoon, like the Sphex. The Ammophila excavates alone,\r\ndeliberately, with no joyous ardour. As usual, the anterior tarsi do\r\nduty as rakes and the mandibles as mining tools. If some grain of sand\r\noffer too much resistance, you may hear rising from the bottom of the\r\nwell a kind of shrill grinding sound, produced by the vibration of the\r\nwings and entire body as if to express the insect’s struggles.\r\nFrequently the Hymenopteron comes up with a load of refuse in its jaws,\r\nsome bit of gravel which it drops as it flies some little way off, in\r\norder not to block up the place. Some appear to merit special attention\r\nby their form and size,—at least the Ammophila does not treat them like\r\nthe rest, for instead of carrying them away on the wing, she goes on\r\nfoot and drops them near the shaft. They are choice material—blocks\r\nready prepared to stop up the dwelling by and by.\r\n\r\nThis outside work is done with a self-contained air and great\r\ndiligence. High on its legs, its abdomen outstretched at the end of its\r\nlong petiole, it turns round and moves its whole body at once with the\r\ngeometrical stiffness of a line revolving on itself. If it has to throw\r\naway to a distance the rubbish it decides to be only encumbrances, it\r\ndoes this with little silent flights, often backwards, as if, having\r\ncome out of the shaft tail first, it thought to save time by not\r\nturning round. Species with long-stalked bodies, like A. sabulosa and\r\nA. argentata, are those that chiefly display this automaton-like\r\nrigidity. Their abdomen, enlarged to a pear-shape at the end of a\r\nthread, is very troublesome to manage; a sudden movement might injure\r\nthe fine stalk, and the insect has to walk with a kind of geometrical\r\nprecision, and if it flies, it goes backward to avoid tacking too\r\noften. On the other hand, A. hirsuta, which has an abdomen with a short\r\npetiole, works at its burrow with swift easy movements such as one\r\nadmires in most of the miners. It can move more freely, not being\r\nembarrassed by its abdomen.\r\n\r\nThe dwelling is hollowed out. Later on, when the sun has passed from\r\nthe spot where the hole is bored, the Ammophila is sure to visit the\r\nlittle heap of stones set aside during her burrowing, intent to choose\r\nsome bit which suits her. If she can find nothing that will do she\r\nexplores round about, and soon discovers what she wants—namely, a small\r\nflat stone rather larger than the mouth of her well. She carries it off\r\nin her mandibles, and for the time being closes the shaft with it. Next\r\nday, when it is hot again, and when the sun bathes the slopes and\r\nfavours the chase, she will know perfectly well how to find her home\r\nagain, secured by the massive door, and she will return with a\r\nparalysed caterpillar, seized by the nape of its neck and dragged\r\nbetween its captor’s feet; she will lift the stone, which is just like\r\nall the others near, and the secret of which is known only to her, will\r\ncarry down the prey, lay an egg, and then stop the burrow once for all\r\nby sweeping into the shaft all the rubbish kept near at hand.\r\n\r\nSeveral times I have seen this temporary closing of the hole by A.\r\nsabulosa and A. argentata when the sun grew low and the late hour\r\nobliged them to wait until the next day to go out hunting. When they\r\nhad put the seals on their dwellings I too waited for the morrow to\r\ncontinue my observations, but first I made sure of the spot by taking\r\nmy bearings and sticking in some bits of wood in order to rediscover\r\nthe well when closed, and always, unless I came too early, if I let the\r\nHymenopteron profit by full sunshine, I found the burrow stored and\r\nclosed for good and all.\r\n\r\nThe fidelity of memory shown here is striking. The insect, belated at\r\nits work, puts off completing it until the morrow. It passes neither\r\nevening nor night in the new-made abode, but departs after marking the\r\nentrance with a small stone. The spot is no more familiar to it than\r\nany other, for like Sphex occitanica the Ammophila lodges her family\r\nhere and there as she may chance to wander. The creature came here by\r\nchance, like the soil, and dug the burrow, and now departs. Whither?\r\nWho knows? Perhaps to the flowers near, to lick up by the last gleam of\r\nday a drop of sugary liquid at the bottom of their cups, just as a\r\nminer after labouring in his dark gallery seeks the consolation of his\r\nbottle when evening comes. The Ammophila may be enticed farther and\r\nfarther by the inviting blossoms. Evening, night, and morning pass, and\r\nnow she must return to her burrow and complete her task,—return after\r\nall her windings and wanderings in the chase that morning, and the\r\nflight from flower to flower, and the libations of the previous\r\nevening. That a wasp should return to the nest and a bee to the hive\r\ndoes not surprise me; these are permanent abodes, and the ways back are\r\nknown by long practice, but the Ammophila, who has to return after so\r\nlong an absence, has no aid from acquaintance with the locality. Her\r\nshaft is in a place which she visited yesterday, perhaps for the first\r\ntime, and must find again to-day when quite beyond her bearings, and,\r\nmoreover, when she is encumbered by heavy prey. Yet this exploit of\r\ntopographical memory is accomplished, and sometimes with a precision\r\nwhich left me amazed. The insect made straight for the burrow as if\r\nlong used to every path in the neighbourhood; but at other times there\r\nwould be long visitation and repeated searches.\r\n\r\nIf the difficulty become serious, the prey, which is an embarrassing\r\nload in a hurried exploration, is laid in some obvious place, on a tuft\r\nof thyme or grass, where it can be easily seen when wanted. Freed from\r\nthis burden the Ammophila resumes an active search. As she hunted about\r\nI have traced with a pencil the track made by her. The result was a\r\nlabyrinth of lines, with curves and sudden angles, now returning inward\r\nand now branching outward—knots and meshes and repeated intersections—a\r\nmaze, showing how perplexed and astray was the insect.\r\n\r\nThe shaft found and the stone lifted, she must return to the prey, not\r\nwithout some uncertainty when comings and goings have been too many.\r\nAlthough it was left in a place obvious enough, the Ammophila often\r\nseems at a loss when the time comes to drag it home; at least, if there\r\nbe a very long search for the burrow, one sees her suddenly stop and go\r\nback to the caterpillar, feel it and give it a little bite, as if to\r\nmake sure that it is her very own game and property, hurrying back to\r\nseek for the burrow, but returning a second time if needful, or even a\r\nthird, to visit her prey. I incline to believe that these repeated\r\nvisits are made to refresh her memory as to where she left it.\r\n\r\nThis is what happens in very complex cases, but generally the insect\r\nreturns without difficulty to the spot whither its vagrant life may\r\nhave led it. For guide it has that local memory whose marvellous feats\r\nI shall later have occasion to relate. As for me, in order to return\r\nnext day to the burrow hidden under the little flat stone, I dared not\r\ntrust to my memory, but had to use notes, sketches, to take my\r\nbearings, and stick in pegs—in short, a whole array of geometry.\r\n\r\nThe temporary closing of the burrow with a flat stone as practised by\r\nA. sabulosa and A. holosericea appears unknown to the two other\r\nspecies; at least I never saw their homes protected by a covering. This\r\nis natural in the case of A. hirsuta, for, I believe, this species\r\nhunts the prey first and then burrows near the place of capture. As\r\nprovender can therefore be at once stored it is useless to take any\r\ntrouble about a cover. As for A. holosericea, I suspect there is\r\nanother reason for not using any temporary door. While the two others\r\nonly put one caterpillar in each cell, she puts as many as five, but\r\nmuch smaller ones. Just as we ourselves neglect to shut a door where\r\nsome one is constantly passing to and fro, perhaps this Ammophila\r\nneglects to place a stone on a well which she will go down at least\r\nfive times within a short space of time. All four lay up caterpillars\r\nof moths for their larvæ. A. holosericea chooses, though not\r\nexclusively, those slender, long caterpillars known as Loopers. They\r\nmove as a compass might by opening and closing alternately, whence\r\ntheir expressive French name of Measurers. The same burrow includes\r\nprovisions of varied colours—a proof that this Ammophila hunts all\r\nkinds of Loopers so long as they are small, for she herself is but\r\nfeeble and the larva cannot eat much, in spite of the five heads of\r\ngame set before it. If Loopers fail, the Hymenopteron falls back on\r\nother caterpillars equally small. Rolled up from the effect of the\r\nsting which paralysed them, all five are heaped in the cell; the top\r\none bears the egg for which the provender is destined.\r\n\r\nThe three other Ammophilæ give but one caterpillar to each cell.\r\nTrue—size makes up for this; the game selected is corpulent, plump,\r\namply sufficing the grub’s appetite. For instance, I have taken out of\r\nthe mandibles of A. holosericea a caterpillar fifteen times her own\r\nweight—fifteen times!—an enormous sum if you consider what an\r\nexpenditure of strength it implies to drag such game by the nape of its\r\nneck over the endless difficulties of the ground. No other Hymenopteron\r\ntried in the scales with its prey has shown me a like disproportion\r\nbetween spoiler and capture. The almost endless variety of colouring in\r\nthe provender exhumed from the burrows or recognised in the grasp of\r\nthe various species also proves that the three have no preference, but\r\nseize the first caterpillar met with, provided it be neither too large\r\nnor too small, and belongs to the moths. The commonest prey are those\r\ngray caterpillars which infest the plant at the junction of a root and\r\nstem just below the soil.\r\n\r\nThat which governs the whole history of the Ammophila, and more\r\nespecially attracted my attention, was the way in which the insect\r\nmasters its prey and plunges it into the harmless state required for\r\nthe safety of the larva. The prey, a caterpillar, is very differently\r\norganised from the victims which we have hitherto seen\r\nsacrificed—Buprestids, Weevils, Grasshoppers, and Ephippigers. It is\r\ncomposed of a series of segments or rings set end to end, the three\r\nfirst bearing the true feet which will be those of the future\r\nbutterfly; others bear membranous or false feet special to the\r\ncaterpillar and not represented in the butterfly; others again are\r\nwithout limbs. Each ring has its ganglion, the source of feeling and\r\nmovement, so that the nerve system comprehends twelve distinct centres\r\nwell separated from each other, without counting the œsophageal\r\nganglion placed under the skull, and which may be compared to the\r\nbrain.\r\n\r\nWe are here a long way from the nerve centralisation of the Weevil and\r\nBuprestis that lends itself so readily to general paralysis by a single\r\nstab; very far too from the thoracic ganglia which the Sphex wounds\r\nsuccessively to put a stop to the movements of her crickets. Instead of\r\na single centralised point—instead of three nerve centres—the\r\ncaterpillar has twelve, separated one from another by the length of a\r\nsegment and arranged in a ventral chain along the median line of the\r\nbody. Moreover, as is the rule among lower animals, where the same\r\norgan is very often repeated and loses power by diffusion, these\r\nvarious nervous centres are largely independent of each other, each\r\nanimating its own segment, and are but slightly disturbed by disorder\r\nin neighbouring ones. Let one segment lose motion and feeling, yet\r\nthose uninjured will none the less remain long capable of both. These\r\nfacts suffice to show the high interest attaching to the murderous\r\nproceedings of the Hymenopteron with regard to its prey.\r\n\r\nBut if the interest be great, the difficulty of observation is not\r\nsmall. The solitary habits of the Ammophila,—their being scattered\r\nsingly over wide spaces, and their being almost always met with by mere\r\nchance,—almost forbid, as in the case of Sphex occitanica, any\r\nexperiment being prepared beforehand. Long must a chance be watched for\r\nand awaited with unalterable patience, and one must know how instantly\r\nto profit by it when at last it comes just when least expected. I have\r\nwaited for such a chance for years and years, and then, all at once, I\r\ngot the opportunity with a facility for observation and clearness of\r\ndetail which made up for the long waiting.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of my observations I succeeded twice in watching the\r\nmurder of the caterpillar, and saw, as far as the rapidity of the\r\noperation allowed, that the sting of the Hymenopteron struck once for\r\nall at the fifth or sixth segment of the victim. To confirm this I\r\nbethought myself of making sure which ring was stabbed by examining\r\ncaterpillars which I had not seen sacrificed, but had carried off from\r\ntheir captors while they were being dragged to the burrow; but it was\r\nvain to use a microscope,—no microscope can show any trace of such a\r\nwound. This was the plan adopted. The caterpillar being quite still, I\r\ntried each segment with the point of a fine needle, measuring the\r\namount of sensibility by the greater or less pain given. Should the\r\nneedle entirely transpierce the fifth segment or the sixth, there is no\r\nmovement. But prick even slightly one in front or behind, the\r\ncaterpillar struggles with a violence proportioned to the distance from\r\nthe poisoned segment. Especially does the least touch on the hinder\r\nones produce frantic contorsions. So there was but one stab, and it was\r\ngiven in the fifth or sixth segment.\r\n\r\nWhat special reason is there that one or other of these two should be\r\nthe spot chosen by the assassin? None in their organisation, but their\r\nposition is another thing. Omitting the Loopers of Ammophila\r\nholosericea, I find that the prey of the others has the following\r\norganisation, counting the head as the first segment:—Three pairs of\r\ntrue feet on rings two, three, and four; four pairs of membranous feet\r\non rings seven, eight, nine, and ten, and a last similar pair set on\r\nthe thirteenth and final ring; in all eight pairs of feet, the seven\r\nfirst making two marked groups—one of three, the other of four pairs.\r\nThese two groups are divided by two segments without feet, which are\r\nthe fifth and sixth.\r\n\r\nNow, to deprive the caterpillar of means of escape, and to render it\r\nmotionless, will the Hymenopteron dart its sting into each of the eight\r\nrings provided with feet? Especially will it do so when the prey is\r\nsmall and weak? Certainly not: a single stab will suffice if given in a\r\ncentral spot, whence the torpor produced by the venomous droplet can\r\nspread gradually with as little delay as possible into the midst of\r\nthose segments which bear feet. There can be no doubt which to choose\r\nfor this single inoculation; it must be the fifth or sixth, which\r\nseparate the two groups of locomotive rings. The point indicated by\r\nrational deduction is also the one adopted by instinct. Finally, let us\r\nadd that the egg of the Ammophila is invariably laid on the paralysed\r\nring. There, and there alone, can the young larva bite without inducing\r\ndangerous contorsions; where a needle prick has no effect, the bite of\r\na grub will have none either, and the prey will remain immovable until\r\nthe nursling has gained strength and can bite farther on without\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nWith further researches doubts assailed me, not as to my deductions,\r\nbut as to how widely I might extend them. That many feeble Loopers and\r\nother small caterpillars are disabled by a single stab, especially when\r\nstruck at so favourable a point as the one just named, is very probable\r\nin itself, and, moreover, is shown both by direct observation and by\r\nexperiments on their sensibility with the point of a needle. But\r\nAmmophila sabulosa and hirsuta catch huge prey, whose weight, as\r\nalready said, is fifteen times that of the captor. Can such giant prey\r\nbe treated like a poor Looper? Can a single stab subdue the monster and\r\nrender it incapable of harm? If the fearsome gray worm strike the cell\r\nwalls with its strong body, will it not endanger the egg or the little\r\nlarva? One dares not imagine a tête-à-tête in the small cell at the\r\nbottom of the burrow between the frail, newly-hatched creature and this\r\nkind of dragon:—still able to coil and uncoil its lithe folds.\r\n\r\nMy suspicions were heightened by examination as to the sensitiveness of\r\nthe caterpillar. While the small game of Ammophila holosericea and\r\nhirsuta struggle violently if pricked elsewhere than in the part\r\nstabbed, the large caterpillars of A. sabulosa, and above all of A.\r\nhirsuta, remain motionless, no matter which segment be stimulated. They\r\nshow no contortions or sudden twisting of the body, the steel point\r\nonly producing as a sign faint shudderings of the skin. As the safety\r\nof a larva provided with such huge prey requires, motion and feeling\r\nare almost quite destroyed. Before introducing it into the burrow, the\r\nHymenopteron turns it into a mass—inert indeed, yet not dead.\r\n\r\nI have been able to watch the Ammophila use her instrument on the\r\nrobust caterpillar, and never did the infused science of instinct show\r\nme anything more striking. With a friend—alas! soon after snatched from\r\nme by death—I was returning from the tableland of Les Angles after\r\npreparing snares to put the cleverness of Scarabæus sacer to the proof,\r\nwhen we caught sight of an Ammophila hirsuta very busy at the foot of a\r\ntuft of thyme. We instantly lay down very close by. Our presence noways\r\nalarmed the insect, which alighted for a moment on my sleeve, decided\r\nthat since her visitors did not move they must be harmless, and\r\nreturned to her tuft of thyme. Well used to the ways of Ammophila, I\r\nknew what this audacious tameness meant—she was occupied by some\r\nserious affair. We would wait and see. The Ammophila scratched in the\r\nground round the collar of the plant, pulling up thin little grass\r\nroots, and poked her head under the tiny clods which she raised up, ran\r\nhurriedly, now here, now there, round the thyme, visiting every crack\r\nwhich gave access under it; yet she was not digging a burrow, but\r\nhunting something hidden underground, as was shown by manœuvres like\r\nthose of a dog trying to get a rabbit out of its hole. And presently,\r\ndisturbed by what was going on overhead and closely tracked by the\r\nAmmophila, a big gray worm made up his mind to quit his abode and come\r\nup to daylight. It is all over with him; the hunter is instantly on the\r\nspot, gripping the nape of his neck and holding on in spite of his\r\ncontortions. Settled on the monster’s back the Ammophila bends her\r\nabdomen, and methodically, deliberately—like a surgeon thoroughly\r\nfamiliar with the anatomy of his subject—plunges a lancet into the\r\nventral surface of every segment, from the first to the last. Not one\r\nring is omitted; with or without feet each is stabbed in due order from\r\nthe front to the back.\r\n\r\nThis is what I saw with all the leisure and ease required for an\r\nirreproachable observation. The Hymenopteron acts with a precision of\r\nwhich science might be jealous; it knows what man but rarely knows; it\r\nis acquainted with the complex nervous system of its victim, and keeps\r\nrepeated stabs for those with numerous ganglia. I said “It knows; is\r\nacquainted”: what I ought to say is, “It acts as if it did.” What it\r\ndoes is suggested to it; the creature obeys, impelled by instinct,\r\nwithout reasoning on what it does. But whence comes this sublime\r\ninstinct? Can theories of atavism, of selection, of the struggle for\r\nlife, interpret it reasonably? For my friend and myself it was and is\r\none of the most eloquent revelations of the ineffable logic which rules\r\nthe world and guides the unconscious by the laws which it inspires.\r\nStirred to the heart by this flash of truth, both of us felt a tear of\r\nemotion rise to our eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nTHE BEMBEX\r\n\r\n\r\nNot far from Avignon, on the right bank of the Rhône opposite the mouth\r\nof the Durance, is one of my favourite points for the observations\r\nabout to be recorded. It is the Bois des Issarts. Let no one deceive\r\nhimself as to the value of the word “bois”—wood, which usually gives\r\nthe idea of a soil carpeted with fresh moss and the shade of lofty\r\ntrees, through whose foliage filters a subdued light. Scorching plains,\r\nwhere the cicada grinds out its song under pale olives, know nothing of\r\nsuch delicious retreats full of shade and coolness.\r\n\r\nThe Bois des Issarts is composed of thin and scattered groups of ilex,\r\nwhich hardly lessen the force of the sun’s rays. When I established\r\nmyself during the dog days in July and August, I used to settle myself\r\nat some spot in the wood favourable for observations. I took refuge\r\nunder a great umbrella, which later lent me most unexpected aid of\r\nanother kind, very valuable too, as my story will show in good time. If\r\nI had neglected to equip myself with this article, embarrassing enough\r\nin a long walk, the only way to avoid sunstroke was to lie at full\r\nlength behind some heap of sand, and when my temporal arteries beat\r\nintolerably, the last resource was to shelter my head at the mouth of a\r\nrabbit hole. Such are the means of getting cool in the Bois des\r\nIssarts.\r\n\r\nThe soil, unoccupied by any woody vegetation, is almost bare and\r\ncomposed of a fine, arid, very light sand, heaped by the wind in little\r\nhillocks where the stems and roots of the ilex hinder its blowing\r\nabout. The slope of such hillocks is generally very smooth, from the\r\nextreme lightness of the material, which runs down into the least\r\ndepression, thus restoring the regularity of the surface. It is enough\r\nto thrust a finger into the sand, and then to withdraw it in order\r\nimmediately to cause a downfall, which fills up the cavity and\r\nre-establishes the former state of things without leaving any trace.\r\nBut at a certain depth, varying according to the more or less recent\r\ndate of the last rains, the sand retains a dampness which keeps it\r\nstable, and lends a consistency allowing of slight excavations without\r\nroof and walls falling in. A burning sun, a radiant blue sky, sand\r\nslopes yielding without the least difficulty to the strokes of the\r\nHymenopteron’s rake, abundant game for the larvæ, a peaceful site\r\nrarely troubled by the foot of the passer-by,—all unite here in this\r\nparadise of the Bembex. Let us see the industrious insect at work.\r\n\r\nIf the reader will come under my umbrella, or profit by my rabbit\r\nburrow, this is the sight which will meet him towards the end of July.\r\nA Bembex (B. rostrata) arrives of a sudden and alights without\r\nhesitation or investigation at a spot which, as far as I see, differs\r\nin nothing from the rest of the sandy surface. With her front tarsi,\r\nwhich, armed with stiff rows of hairs, suggest at once broom, brush,\r\nand rake, she begins to dig a subterranean dwelling, standing on her\r\nfour hind feet, the two last slightly apart, while the front ones\r\nalternately scratch and sweep the loose sand. The precision and\r\nrapidity of the action could not be greater were the circular movement\r\nof the tarsi worked by a spring. The sand, shot backward under the\r\ncreature, clears the arch of its hind legs, trickling like a liquid in\r\na continuous thread, describing a parabola and falling some eight\r\ninches away. This dusty jet, constantly fed for five or ten minutes, is\r\nenough to show with what dizzy rapidity the tools are used. I could\r\nquote no second example of equal swiftness, which yet in no way\r\ndetracts from the elegance and free movements of the insect as it\r\nadvances and retires, now on one side, now on another, without allowing\r\nthe parabola of sand to stop.\r\n\r\nThe soil hollowed is of the lightest kind. As the Hymenopteron\r\nexcavates, the sand near falls and fills the cavity. In the landslip\r\nare mingled little bits of wood, decayed leaf-stalks, and grains of\r\ngravel larger than the rest. The Bembex picks these up in her\r\nmandibles, and, moving backward, carries them to a distance, returning\r\nto sweep again, but always lightly, without attempting to penetrate\r\ninto the earth. What is the object in this surface labour? It would be\r\nimpossible to learn from a first glance, but after spending many days\r\nwith my dear Hymenoptera, and grouping together the scattered results\r\nof my observations, I think I divine the motive of these proceedings.\r\n\r\nThe nest is certainly there—underground, at the depth of a few inches:\r\nin a little cell, dug in cool firm sand, is an egg, perhaps a larva,\r\nwhich the mother feeds daily with flies, the invariable food of Bembex\r\nlarvæ. She must be able at any moment to penetrate to this nest,\r\ncarrying on the wing, between her feet, the nursling’s daily ration,\r\njust as a bird of prey arrives at its eyrie carrying game for its brood\r\nin its claw. But while the bird returns to a nest on some inaccessible\r\nshelf of rock, without any difficulty beyond the weight of its prey,\r\nthe Bembex must undertake each time the hard work of mining, opening\r\nafresh a gallery blocked and closed by ever-sliding sand in proportion\r\nas she proceeds. The only stable part of this underground abode is the\r\nspacious cell inhabited by the larva amid the remains of a fortnight’s\r\nfeast; the narrow vestibule entered by the mother to go down to the\r\ncell, or come forth for the chase, gives way each time, at all events\r\nat the upper end, built in dry sand, rendered even looser by her\r\nconstant goings and comings. Thus at each entrance or exit the\r\nHymenopteron must clear out a passage. The exit offers no difficulties,\r\neven should the sand have the same consistency as when first stirred;\r\nthe insect’s movements are free; it is safe under cover, can take its\r\ntime and use tarsi and mandibles at its leisure. Going in is another\r\nmatter. The Bembex is embarrassed by her prey, pressed to her body by\r\nher feet, so that there is no free use of the mining tools. What is\r\nmore serious is that impudent parasites—veritable bandits in ambush—are\r\ncrouching here and there about the burrow watching her difficult\r\nentrance to hurriedly drop their egg on the game just as it disappears\r\ninto the gallery. If they succeed, the son of the house, the\r\nHymenopteron’s nursling, will perish, starved by greedy guests.\r\n\r\nThe Bembex seems aware of this danger, and arranges so as to enter\r\nquickly, without serious obstacles, so that the sand blocking the door\r\nshould yield to a mere push from her head, aided by a rapid sweep of\r\nthe forelegs. To this end she, so to say, sifts the materials round her\r\nabode. In leisure moments, when the sun shines and the larva has its\r\nfood, and does not need her care, the mother rakes before her door, and\r\nputs on one side all the tiny bits of wood, of over-large gravel or\r\nleaves, which might get on her path and bar the passage at the perilous\r\nmoment of return. The Bembex which we saw so hard at work was busy\r\nsifting so as to make access to her abode easier; the materials of the\r\nvestibule are examined, minutely sorted, and cleared of every\r\nencumbrance. Who can tell whether the rapid labour and joyous activity\r\nof the insect do not express in their own way her maternal satisfaction\r\nand happiness in caring for the roof of the cell which has received the\r\nprecious trust of the egg? As the Bembex confines herself to exterior\r\nhousehold cares without seeking to penetrate the sand, everything must\r\nbe in order within, and there is nothing pressing to do. We may wait,\r\nbut for the time the insect will teach us nothing more. Let us\r\ntherefore examine the underground dwelling.\r\n\r\nBy lightly scratching the bank with the blade of a knife just where the\r\nBembex was oftenest seen, one soon discovers the entrance hall, which,\r\nblocked as it is for part of its length, is none the less recognisable\r\nby the special look of the materials moved about. This passage, a\r\nfinger’s-breadth in size, rectilinear or winding, longer or shorter,\r\naccording to the nature of the ground, measures eight to twelve inches.\r\nIt leads to a single chamber, hollowed in damp sand, with walls\r\nundaubed with mortar, which might prevent landslips and lend polish to\r\nthe rough surface. Enough if the ceiling lasts while the larva is being\r\nfed up. Future falling-in matters little when the larva is enclosed in\r\nits stout cocoon—a kind of strong box, which we shall see in process of\r\nconstruction. In workmanship the cell is as rustic as possible, being\r\nmerely a rude excavation with no well-determined form, low roofed, and\r\nof a size which might hold two or three nests.\r\n\r\nWithin lies one head of game—one only—quite small and quite\r\ninsufficient for the voracious nursling for whom it is destined. It is\r\na golden green-fly, Lucilia Cæsar, a dweller in tainted meat, and is\r\nquite motionless. Is it really dead or only paralysed? This will be\r\ncleared up later. Just now let us observe the cylindrical egg upon its\r\nside, white, slightly curved, and a couple of millimetres in length. It\r\nis a Bembex egg. As we have foreseen from the mother’s behaviour, there\r\nis no pressing household business; the egg is laid and a first ration\r\nprovided for the needs of the feeble larva, which ought to hatch in\r\ntwenty-four hours. For some time the Bembex need not re-enter her hole,\r\nconfining herself to keeping a good lookout in the neighbourhood, or\r\npossibly making new burrows and laying there egg after egg, always in a\r\nseparate cell.\r\n\r\nThis peculiarity of beginning to lay in food by a single small piece of\r\ngame is not peculiar to Bembex rostrata; all the other species do the\r\nsame. Open any cell after the egg is laid, and you always find it glued\r\nto the side of a Dipteron—all the food there is; moreover, this first\r\nration is invariably small, as if the mother had sought some specially\r\ntender mouthful for her frail nursling. Another motive, the freshness\r\nof the food, may also have guided her choice. Later we will look\r\nfurther into the matter. This first ration—always a moderate one—varies\r\nmuch, according to the frequency of such or such a kind of game in the\r\nneighbourhood. It is sometimes a Lucilia Cæsar, sometimes a Stomoxys,\r\nor some small Eristalis, or a delicate Bombylius clad in black velvet,\r\nbut the commonest is a Sphærophoria with a slender abdomen. This fact\r\n(and it has no exception) of storing the nest with but a single\r\nDipteron,—a ration far too meagre for a larva with a voracious\r\nappetite,—at once puts us on the track of the most remarkable habit of\r\nthe Bembecidæ. Hymenoptera whose larvæ live on prey heap into each cell\r\nthe whole number of victims needed by the grub, which is hatched and\r\nlives alone,—an egg having been laid on one fly and the dwelling closed\r\nup. The larva has before it its whole store of food. But the Bembex is\r\nan exception to this rule. First a head of game is brought to the cell\r\nand an egg dropped on it. Then the mother leaves the burrow, which\r\ncloses of its own accord; besides which she takes care to rake the\r\nsurface smooth, and hide the entrance from every eye but her own.\r\n\r\nTwo or three days pass: the egg hatches and the small larva eats up its\r\nchoice ration. Meanwhile, the mother remains near: one may see her\r\nlicking the sugary exudations on the flower-heads of Eryngium campestre\r\nfor nourishment, then settling with enjoyment on the burning sand,\r\nwhence she doubtless surveys the exterior of her dwelling, or she sifts\r\nthe sand at its entrance, then flies off and vanishes—perhaps to\r\nexcavate other cells to be stored in a like manner. But however\r\nprolonged her absence, she does not forget the young larva so scantily\r\nprovided for; maternal instinct teaches her the hour when the grub has\r\nfinished its food and needs new sustenance. Then she comes back to the\r\nnest whose invisible entrance she knows right well how to find, and\r\npenetrates the hollow—this time laden with a larger prey. This\r\ndeposited, she goes out again, and awaits outside the time for a second\r\nexpedition. It soon comes, for the larva shows a devouring appetite.\r\nAgain the mother arrives with fresh provender.\r\n\r\nDuring almost a fortnight, while the larva is growing, the meals follow\r\neach other thus, one by one, as it needs them, and so much the nearer\r\ntogether as the nursling grows stronger. Toward the end of the\r\nfortnight the mother requires all her activity to supply the glutton’s\r\nappetite as it crawls heavily amid the remains of its repasts—wings,\r\nfeet, and horny rings of abdomens. Each moment she returns with a new\r\ncapture or comes forth for the chase. In short, the Bembex brings up\r\nher family from hand to mouth without storing provisions, like the bird\r\nwhich brings a beakful of food to the little ones still in the nest.\r\nAmong the numerous proofs of this method of upbringing—one very\r\nsingular in a Hymenopteron which feeds its family on prey—I have\r\nalready mentioned the presence of the egg in a cell where but one\r\nlittle fly is found as provender—always one—never more. Another proof\r\nis the following one, which does not require any special moment for its\r\nascertainment.\r\n\r\nLet us examine the burrow of a Hymenopteron, which provides beforehand\r\nfor its larvæ. If we choose the moment when the insect enters with a\r\ncaptive, we shall find in the cell a certain number of victims already\r\nstored, but never a larva—not even an egg, for this is only laid when\r\nthe provisions are complete. The egg deposited, the cell is closed, and\r\nthe mother returns no more. It is, therefore, only in burrows where the\r\nmother’s visits are no longer needed that one can find larvæ amid the\r\nlarger or smaller heap of food. Visit, on the other hand, the dwelling\r\nof a Bembex as she enters with the produce of her chase, and you are\r\nsure to find a larva, larger or smaller, amid the remains of food\r\nalready devoured. The ration now brought is to continue a repast which\r\nhas been going on for several days, and is to be prolonged upon the\r\nproduce of future expeditions. If we can make this examination towards\r\nthe end of the larva’s upbringing,—an advantage which I have enjoyed at\r\npleasure,—we shall find upon a great heap of fragments a portly larva,\r\nto which the mother is still bringing food. The Bembex only ceases to\r\ndo so and to leave the cell definitely when the larva, distended by a\r\nwine-coloured pap, refuses to eat, and reclines, thoroughly stuffed, on\r\nthe remains of wings and feet of the game which it has devoured.\r\n\r\nEach time that she penetrates into the burrow on returning from the\r\nchase, the mother brings but a single fly. Were it possible by means of\r\nthe remains contained in a cell where the larva is full grown to count\r\nthe victims served up, one would at least know how often the\r\nHymenopteron visited its burrow after the egg is laid. Unfortunately,\r\nthese broken meats—munched and munched again in moments of scarcity—are\r\nfor the most part unrecognisable. But on opening a cell with a less\r\nadvanced nursling, one can examine the provisions, some of the prey\r\nbeing yet whole or nearly so, and others, more numerous, being trunks\r\nin sufficiently good preservation to be distinguishable. Incomplete as\r\nit is, the enumeration thus obtained strikes one with surprise, as\r\nshowing what activity the Hymenopteron must display to satisfy the\r\ndemands of such a table. Here is one of the bills of fare observed.\r\n\r\nAt the end of July around the larva of Bembex Julia, which had almost\r\nreached the third of its full size, I found the prey of which the\r\nfollowing is the list:—Six Echinomyia rubescens—two whole and four in\r\npieces; four Syrphus corollæ—two whole, two in fragments; three Gonia\r\natra—all intact, and one just brought by the mother, which had enabled\r\nme to discover the burrow; two Pollenia ruficollis—one whole, one\r\nattacked; a Bombylius reduced to pulp; two Echinomyia intermedia in\r\nbits; and finally two Pollenia floralis, also in bits—total, twenty.\r\nCertainly we have here a bill of fare as abundant as varied, but as the\r\nlarva had only attained to a third of its complete size, the entire\r\nbill of fare might well amount to sixty articles.\r\n\r\nThe verification of this magnificent sum-total is easily obtained. I\r\nmyself will undertake the maternal cares of the Bembex, and feed the\r\nlarva until it is thoroughly satisfied. I place the cell in a little\r\ncardboard box furnished with a layer of sand. On this bed is placed the\r\nlarva with due regard to its delicate epidermis. Around it, without\r\nomitting a single fragment, I arrange the provender with which it was\r\nsupplied, and return home with the box still in my hand, to avoid any\r\nshake which might turn it topsy-turvy and endanger my charge during a\r\njourney of several miles. Any one who had seen me on the dusty road to\r\nNîmes, exhausted with fatigue and bearing religiously in my hand, as\r\nthe only result of my painful journey, a wretched grub, distending\r\nitself with a heap of flies, would assuredly have smiled at my\r\nsimplicity. The journey was achieved without hindrance; when I got home\r\nthe larva was peacefully consuming its flies as if nothing had\r\nhappened. On the third day the provisions taken from the burrow were\r\nfinished, and the grub with its pointed mouth was searching in the heap\r\nof remains without finding anything to its taste. The dry, horny,\r\njuiceless pieces which it got hold of were rejected with disgust. The\r\nmoment had come for me to continue the food supply. The first Diptera\r\nwithin reach must content my prisoner; I slew them by squeezing them\r\nbetween my fingers, but did not crush them. Three Eristalis tenax\r\ncomposed the first ration, together with a Sarcophaga. In twenty-four\r\nhours all were devoured. The next day I provided two Eristalis and four\r\nhouse-flies. This sufficed for that day, but nothing was left over. I\r\nwent on thus for a week, giving the grub each morning a larger ration.\r\nOn the ninth day it refused to eat and began to spin its cocoon. The\r\nbill of fare for the week’s high feeding amounted to sixty-two items,\r\nchiefly Eristalis and house-flies, which, added to the twenty items\r\nfound entire or in fragments in the cell, formed a total of eighty-two.\r\n\r\nPossibly I may not have brought up my larva with the wholesome\r\nfrugality which the mother would have shown; there may have been some\r\nwaste in the daily rations, provided all at once and left entirely to\r\nthe discretion of the grub. I fancied that in some particulars things\r\ndid not go on exactly as in the cell, for my notes have such details\r\nas: “In the alluvial sands of the Durance I discovered a burrow into\r\nwhich Bembex oculata had taken a Sarcophaga agricola. At the bottom of\r\nthe gallery was a larva, numerous fragments, and some Diptera\r\nentire—namely, four Sphærophoria scripta, one Onesia viarum, and two\r\nSarcophaga agricola, counting that which the Bembex had brought under\r\nmy very eyes.” Now it must be remarked that one half of this game, the\r\nSphærophoria, was quite at the bottom of the cell—under the very jaws\r\nof the larva, while the other half was still in the gallery—on the\r\nthreshold of the cell—consequently out of the grub’s reach, as it could\r\nnot leave its place. It would seem that when game abounds, the mother\r\ndisposes provisionally of her captures on the threshold of the cell,\r\nand forms a reserve on which she draws as need arises, especially on\r\nrainy days, when all labour is at a standstill. This economy in\r\ndistributing food would prevent the waste unavoidable with my larva\r\nperhaps too sumptuously treated. I subtract then from the sum obtained,\r\nand reduce it to sixty pieces of medium size, between that of the\r\nhouse-fly and Eristalis tenax. This would be about the number of\r\nDiptera given by the mother to the larva when the prey is middle-sized,\r\nas is the case with all the Bembecids of my district except B. rostrata\r\nand B. bidentata, which especially favour the gadfly. For these the\r\nnumber of slain would be from one to two dozen, according to the size\r\nof the Dipteron, which varies greatly in the gadfly species.\r\n\r\nIn order not to return to the kind of provisions, I give a list of the\r\nDiptera observed in the burrows of the six kinds of Bembex, which are\r\nthe subject of this essay.\r\n\r\n(1) B. olivacea, Rossi. Once only have I seen this species, at\r\nCavaillon, preying on Lucilia Cæsar. The five next are common round\r\nAvignon.\r\n\r\n(2) B. oculata, Jur. The Dipteron upon which the egg is laid is\r\ngenerally a Sphærophoria, especially S. scripta; sometimes it is a\r\nGeron gibbosus. Further provender consisted in Stomoxys calcitrans,\r\nPollenia ruficollis, P. rudis, Pipiza nigripes, Syrphus corollæ, Onesia\r\nviarum, Calliphora vomitoria, Echinomyia intermedia, Sarcophaga\r\nagricola, Musca domestica. The usual food was Stomoxys calcitrans, of\r\nwhich I have found fifty or sixty in a single burrow.\r\n\r\n(3) Bembex tarsata, Lat. It, too, lays its egg on Sphærophoria scripta;\r\nbut it also hunts Anthrax flava, Bombylius nitidulus, Eristalis æneus,\r\nE. sepulchralis, Merodon spinipes, Syrphus corollæ, Helophilus\r\ntrivittatus, Zodion notatum. Its favourite prey consists in Bombylius\r\nand Anthrax.\r\n\r\n(4) Bembex Julii (a new species). The egg hatches either on a\r\nSphærophoria or a Pollenia floralis, and the provender is a mixture of\r\nSyrphus corollæ, Echinomyia rubescens, Gonia atra, Pollenia floralis,\r\nP. ruficollis, Clytia pellucens, Lucilia Cæsar, Dexia rustica,\r\nBombylius.\r\n\r\n(5) Bembex rostrata. This is above all a captor of gadflies. It lays\r\nits egg on a Syrphus corollæ, or a Lucilia Cæsar, but then only brings\r\nto the larva large game belonging to the various kinds of Tabanus.\r\n\r\n(6) Bembex bidentata. Another ardent hunter of gadflies. I have never\r\nseen it with other game, and do not know on what the egg is laid.\r\n\r\nThis variety of provisions shows that the Bembecids have no exclusive\r\ntastes, and attack one and all of the species of Diptera which are\r\noffered by the chances of the chase. They seem, however, to have some\r\nfavourites—one species especially choosing Bombylius, another Stomoxys,\r\nand a third and fourth, Gadflies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nHUNTING DIPTERA\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter this bill of fare for Bembecids in the larva state, we must seek\r\nthe motive which causes these Hymenoptera to adopt a mode of storage\r\nexceptional among Fossors. Why, instead of laying up sufficient food\r\nand dropping an egg on it, which would allow the cell to be closed at\r\nonce without need of returning, does the Hymenopteron oblige itself to\r\ncome and go perpetually for a fortnight from the fields to the burrow\r\nand back again, toiling every time through the sand to issue forth and\r\nhunt, or bring back prey? The explanation is that the food must be\r\nfresh—an all-important matter, for the grub absolutely refuses game\r\nwhich is at all high, with a hint of decay; like the larvæ of all\r\nFossors, it must have fresh provisions—always fresh provisions.\r\n\r\nWe have seen in the case of the Cerceris, Sphex, and Ammophila how the\r\nmother resolves the feeding problem, by placing beforehand in the cell\r\na sufficient quantity of game, and also that of keeping it for weeks\r\nperfectly fresh—nay, almost alive, though motionless—in order to secure\r\nthe safety of the grub which feeds on the prey. This marvel is brought\r\nabout by the most skilful means known to physiology. The poisoned sting\r\nis sent into the nerve centres once or oftener, according to the\r\nconstruction of the nervous system, and the victim retains all which we\r\ncall life, except power of motion.\r\n\r\nLet us see if the Bembex practises this deep science of murder. Diptera\r\ntaken from between the feet of their captor as the latter enters the\r\nburrow mostly seem quite dead. They are motionless; only in rare cases\r\nare there some slight convulsions of the tarsi—the last vestiges of\r\nlife soon to be extinct. The same appearance of complete death is\r\nfound, as a rule, in insects not really killed but paralysed by the\r\nskilful stab of a Cerceris or a Sphex. The question as to life or death\r\ncan, therefore, only be decided by the manner in which the victims keep\r\nfresh.\r\n\r\nPlaced in little paper twists or glass tubes, the Orthoptera of the\r\nSphex, the caterpillars of the Ammophila, the Coleoptera of the\r\nCerceris, preserve flexibility of limb and freshness of colour, and the\r\nnormal state of their intestines, for weeks and months. They are not\r\ncorpses, but bodies plunged in a lethargy from which there will be no\r\nawakening. The Diptera of the Bembex behave quite otherwise. Eristalis,\r\nSyrphus,—in short, all which are brightly coloured,—soon lose their\r\nbrilliance; the eyes of certain gadflies, magnificently gilded, and\r\nwith three purple bands, soon grow pale and dim, like the gaze of a\r\ndying man. All these Diptera, great and small, placed in paper twists\r\nwhere air circulates, dry up and grow brittle in two or three days,\r\nwhile all kept from evaporation in glass tubes, where the air is\r\nstagnant, grow mouldy and decay. So they are dead—really dead—when\r\ncarried to the larva. If some few preserve a little life, a few days, a\r\nfew hours ends all. Not being clever enough to use its sting, or for\r\nsome other reason, the assassin kills its victims outright.\r\n\r\nKnowing this complete death of the prey at the moment when it is\r\nseized, who would not admire the logic of the Bembecid’s manœuvres? How\r\nmethodical all is, and how one thing brings about another in all which\r\nthe wary Hymenopteron does! As the food could not be stored without its\r\ndecaying at the end of two or three days, it cannot be laid in\r\nwholesale at the beginning of a phase of life destined to last at least\r\na fortnight, and there must be a hunt and distribution of provisions\r\nday by day, in proportion to the larva’s growth. The first ration—that\r\non which the egg is laid—will last longer than the others, and must be\r\nsmall, for the little grub will take several days to eat it, and if too\r\nbig it would go bad before it was finished. Therefore it will not be a\r\nhuge gadfly or a corpulent Bombylius, but a small Sphærophoria, or\r\nsomething of that kind, as a tender meal for a still frail larva.\r\nLater, and gradually larger, will come the bigger joints.\r\n\r\nIn the mother’s absence the burrow must be closed to prevent awkward\r\nintrusions, but the entrance must be one opened quickly, without\r\nserious difficulty, when the Hymenopteron returns loaded with prey, and\r\nlaid in wait for by audacious parasites. These conditions would be\r\nwanting in a tenacious soil, such as that in which the mining\r\nHymenoptera habitually establish themselves. The wide-open entrance\r\nwould each time require long and painful labour, whether to close it\r\nwith earth or gravel, or to clear it. The domicile, therefore, must be\r\nhollowed in earth with a very light surface, in dry, fine sand,\r\nyielding at once to the least effort of the mother, and which slips and\r\ncloses the entrance like floating tapestry, which, pushed back by the\r\nhand, allows entrance and then drops back. Such is the sequence of\r\nacts, deduced by human reason, and put into practice by the wisdom of\r\nthe Bembex.\r\n\r\nWhy does the spoiler kill the prey instead of paralysing it? Is it want\r\nof skill with the sting? Is it a difficulty arising from the\r\norganisation of the Diptera or from the manœuvres of the chase? I must\r\nown, at once, that I have failed to put a Dipteron, without killing it,\r\ninto that state of complete immobility into which it is so easy to\r\nplunge a Buprestis, a Weevil, or a Scarabæus, by injecting a little\r\ndrop of ammonia, on the point of a needle, into the thoracic ganglia.\r\nIt is difficult to render your subject motionless; when it no longer\r\nmoves, actual death has occurred, as is proved by its speedy decay or\r\ndesiccation. But I have too much confidence in the resources of\r\ninstinct,—I have seen the ingenious solution of too many problems,—to\r\nbelieve that a difficulty, though insurmountable for the experimenter,\r\ncan baffle an insect; therefore, without casting doubt on the Bembex’s\r\ncapacity for murder, I should be inclined to seek other motives.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the Dipteron, so thinly cuirassed, of so little substance,—so\r\nlean, in short,—could not, when paralysed by a sting, resist\r\nevaporation, and would dry up in two or three weeks. Consider the\r\nslender Sphærophoria—the larva’s first mouthful. What is there in this\r\nbody to evaporate? An atom—a mere nothing. The body is a thin strip—its\r\ntwo walls touch. Could such prey form a basis for preserved food when a\r\nfew hours would evaporate its juices, unrenewed by nutrition? To say\r\nthe least, it is doubtful.\r\n\r\nLet us proceed to consider the manner of hunting, by way of throwing a\r\nfinal light on the subject. In prey withdrawn from the clasp of a\r\nBembex, one may not infrequently observe indications of a capture made\r\nin haste, as best might be, in the chances of a wild struggle.\r\nSometimes the Dipteron has its head turned backward, as if its neck had\r\nbeen twisted, its wings are crumpled, and its hairs, if it have any,\r\nare ruffled. I have seen one with the body ripped open by a bite from\r\nthe mandibles, and legs lost in the battle. Usually, however, the prey\r\nis intact.\r\n\r\nNo matter. Considering that the game has wings prompt in flight, the\r\ncapture must be made with a suddenness which it seems to me hardly\r\nallows of obtaining paralysis without death. A Cerceris with its heavy\r\nweevil, a Sphex engaged with a corpulent grasshopper or a paunched\r\nephippiger, an Ammophila holding its caterpillar by the nape of its\r\nneck, have all three the advantage over a prey too slow to avoid\r\nattack. They may take their time, choose at leisure the exact spot\r\nwhere the sting shall penetrate, and, in short, can act with the\r\nprecision of a physiologist who uses his scalpel on a patient laid upon\r\nthe operating table; but for the Bembex it is another matter. At the\r\nleast alarm the prey is off, and its power of wing defies that of the\r\npursuer. The Hymenopteron must pounce on its prey, without measuring\r\nits attack or calculating its blow, like a hawk hunting over the\r\nfallows. Mandibles, claws, sting—all weapons—must be used at the same\r\nmoment in the hot battle, to end as fast as possible a struggle in\r\nwhich the least indecision would give the prey time to escape. If these\r\nconjectures agree with facts, the Bembex can only secure a dead body,\r\nor, at all events, a prey wounded to death.\r\n\r\nWell, my calculations are right. The Bembex attacks with an energy\r\nwhich would do honour to a bird of prey. To surprise one on the chase\r\nis no easy matter, and it would be useless to lay in a stock of\r\npatience and watch near the burrow, for the insect flies to a distance,\r\nand it is impossible to follow its rapid evolutions, and doubtless its\r\nmanœuvres would be still unknown to me but for the help of an article\r\nfrom which I should assuredly never have expected a like\r\nservice—namely, the umbrella which served me as a tent amid the sands\r\nof Issarts.\r\n\r\nI was not the only one to profit by its shade; my companions were\r\nusually numerous. Gadflies of different kinds would take refuge under\r\nthe silken canopy, and roost peacefully here and there on the outspread\r\nsilk, rarely failing to appear when the heat was overpowering. To pass\r\nthe hours when I was unemployed, I used to observe with pleasure their\r\ngreat gilded eyes shining like carbuncles under my canopy, or their\r\ngrave movements when some spot of their ceiling became too much heated,\r\nand they were forced to move a little way.\r\n\r\nOne day—ping! ping! the tense silk was resounding like the parchment of\r\na drum. Perhaps an acorn has fallen on my umbrella. Soon after, close\r\ntogether, came ping! ping! Has some idle jester come to disturb my\r\nsolitude, and fling acorns or little pebbles on my umbrella? I came out\r\nof my tent and inspected the neighbourhood. Nothing! The blow was\r\nrepeated. I looked upward, and the mystery was explained. The Bembecids\r\nof the neighbourhood, which prey on gadflies, had found out the rich\r\nstore of food which was keeping me company, and were darting\r\naudaciously under my shelter to seize the gadflies on the ceiling.\r\nNothing could have been better. I had only to keep quiet and observe.\r\n\r\nEvery moment a Bembex entered like a sudden flash, and darted up to the\r\nsilken ceiling, which resounded with a dull thud. A tumult went on\r\naloft, in which one could not distinguish attacker from attacked, so\r\nlively was the mêlée. The struggle was very brief; almost at once the\r\nHymenopteron retired with a captive between its feet. The dull band of\r\ngadflies drew a little back all round on this sudden irruption, which\r\ndecimated them, but without leaving the treacherous shelter. It was so\r\nhot outside; wherefore move? Plainly, such swift attack and prompt\r\ndeparture with the prey does not allow the Bembex to use a poignard\r\naccording to rules. The sting no doubt fulfils its office, but is\r\ndirected with no precision towards such spots as are exposed by the\r\nchances of the combat. To slay outright the half-murdered gadfly, still\r\nstruggling between the feet of its assassin, I have seen the Bembex\r\nchew the head and thorax of her victim. This habit, peculiar to the\r\nBembecids, shows that the Bembex desires death, not paralysis, since\r\nshe ends the life of the Diptera with so little ceremony. Everything\r\nconsidered, I think that on the one side the nature of the prey, so\r\nquickly dried up, and on the other, the difficulties of so vehement an\r\nattack, are the reasons why the Bembecids serve up dead prey to their\r\nlarvæ, and consequently provide it daily.\r\n\r\nLet us follow the Hymenopteron when it returns with its captive closely\r\nclasped to the burrow. Here is one—B. tarsata—coming loaded with a\r\nBombylius. The nest is placed at the sandy foot of a vertical slope,\r\nand the approach of the Bembex is announced by a sharp humming,\r\nsomewhat plaintive, and only ceasing when the insect has alighted. One\r\nsees her hover above the bank, then descend, following the vertical\r\nline slowly and cautiously, still emitting the sharp hum. If her keen\r\ngaze should discover anything unusual, she delays her descent, hovers a\r\nmoment, ascends again, redescends, then flies away, swift as an arrow.\r\nIn a few moments she returns. Hovering at a certain height she appears\r\nto inspect the locality, as if from the top of an observatory. The\r\nvertical descent is resumed with most circumspect deliberation;\r\nfinally, she alights without hesitation at a spot which to my eye has\r\nnothing to distinguish it from the rest of the sandy surface. The\r\nplaintive note ceases at once. She must have alighted somewhat by\r\nchance, since the most practised eye could not distinguish one spot\r\nfrom another on the sandy tract. She will have dropped down somewhere\r\nnear her hole, whose entrance she will now seek, marked since her last\r\nexit not only by the natural falling in of materials, but by her\r\nscrupulous sweeping. No! she does not hesitate in the least—does not\r\nfeel about—does not seek. All have agreed that the organs fitted to\r\ndirect insects in their researches reside in the antennæ. At the moment\r\nof returning to the nest I see nothing special in their play. Without\r\nonce losing hold of the prey the Bembex scratches a little in front of\r\nher just where she alighted, pushes with her head, and straightway\r\nenters clasping the Dipteron to her body. The sand falls in, the door\r\ncloses, and the Hymenopteron is at home.\r\n\r\nI have watched the Bembex return home a hundred times, yet it is always\r\nwith fresh astonishment that I see the keen-sighted insect at once\r\ndetect an entrance which nothing indicates, and which indeed is\r\njealously hidden—not indeed when she has entered (for the sand, more or\r\nless fallen in, does not become level, and now leaves a slight\r\ndepression, now a porch incompletely obstructed), but always after she\r\ncomes out, for when going on an expedition she never neglects to efface\r\nthe traces of the sliding sand. Let us await her departure, and we\r\nshall see that she sweeps before her door and levels everything\r\nscrupulously. When she is gone, I defy the keenest eye to rediscover\r\nthe entrance. To find it when the sandy tract was of some extent I was\r\nforced to have recourse to a kind of triangulation, and how often did\r\nmy triangle and efforts of memory prove vain after a few hours’\r\nabsence! I was obliged to have recourse to a stake—in other words, a\r\ngrass stalk planted before the entrance—a means not always effectual,\r\nfor it often disappeared during the frequent settings to rights of the\r\noutside of the Bembex’s nest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\nA PARASITE—THE COCOON\r\n\r\n\r\nI have just described the Bembex hovering, loaded with her prey, above\r\nthe nest, and descending with a vertical flight—very slow, and\r\naccompanied by a plaintive hum. This cautious, hesitating mode of\r\narrival might suggest that the insect was examining from above in order\r\nto find her door, and trying to recall the locality before alighting.\r\nBut I shall show that there is another motive. In ordinary conditions,\r\nwhen nothing alarms her, she comes suddenly, without hovering or\r\nplaintive hum or hesitation, and alights at her threshold, or close by.\r\nSo faithful is her memory that she has no need to search about. Let us\r\nfind out the cause of the hesitating arrival just described.\r\n\r\nThe insect hovers, descends slowly, mounts again, flies off and\r\nreturns, because serious danger threatens. That plaintive hum is a sign\r\nof anxiety, and is never produced unless there is peril. But who is the\r\nenemy? Is it I, sitting by and watching? Not in the least; I am quite\r\nunimportant—a block unworthy of notice. The dreaded enemy—the foe who\r\nmust be avoided at any price—is on the ground, perfectly still upon the\r\nsand, near the nest. It is a small Dipteron—nothing at all to look\r\nat—of inoffensive aspect. This petty fly is the terror of the Bembex.\r\nThat bold assassin of Diptera, who so promptly twists the neck of\r\ncolossal gadflies, full fed on blood from an ox’s back, dares not enter\r\nher home because she sees herself watched by another Dipteron—a mere\r\npigmy, which would scarce make one mouthful for her larva.\r\n\r\nWhy not pounce on it and get rid of it? The Bembex flies fast enough to\r\novertake it, and, small as it is, the larvæ would not disdain it, since\r\nthey eat all and every Diptera. Yet the Bembex flies in terror before\r\nan enemy which one bite would hew in pieces. I really feel as though I\r\nsaw a cat wild with terror before a mouse. The ardent pursuer of\r\nDiptera is driven away by a Dipteron, and that one of the smallest! I\r\nbow before the facts without any hope of ever comprehending this\r\nreversal of parts. To be able to get rid easily of a mortal enemy, who\r\nis meditating the ruin of your family, and who might make a feast for\r\nthem—to be able, I say, to do this, and not to do it when the foe is\r\nthere, within reach, watching you, defying you,—is the height of folly\r\nin an animal. Folly, however, is not rightly the word: let us rather\r\ntalk of the harmony of creatures, for since this wretched little\r\nDipteron has its small part to play in the great whole of things, the\r\nBembex must needs respect it and basely flee before it,—otherwise long\r\nago there would have been no more Dipteron of this species in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nLet us trace the history of this parasite. Among Bembex nests there are\r\nfound, and that frequently, some which are occupied at the same time by\r\nthe larvæ of the Hymenoptera and by other larvæ—strangers to the family\r\nand greedily sharing their food. These strangers are smaller than the\r\nnursling of the Bembex—shaped like a tear, and of the colour of wine,\r\nfrom the food paste which can be seen through their transparent bodies.\r\nTheir number varies from six to ten or more. They belong to a kind of\r\nDipteron, as may be perceived from their form and from the pupæ which\r\none afterwards finds in their place. The demonstration is completed by\r\nbringing them up one’s self in a box, where, fed daily with flies, and\r\nlaid on sand, they turn into pupæ, whence issue the following year\r\nlittle Diptera—Tachinids of the genus Miltogramma.\r\n\r\nThis is the Dipteron which, when lying in wait near the burrow, awakens\r\nsuch alarm in the Bembex. Her terror is only too well founded. This is\r\nwhat happens in the dwelling. Around the heap of food which the mother\r\nwears herself out in providing in sufficient quantity, sit in company\r\nwith the legitimate nursling from six to ten hungry guests, who put\r\ntheir sharp mouths into the general heap as unceremoniously as if they\r\nwere at home. Concord seems to reign at table. I have never seen the\r\nlegitimate larva take offence at the indiscretion of the strangers, nor\r\nobserved these attempt to trouble its repast. All keep themselves\r\ntogether, and eat peaceably without annoying their neighbours.\r\n\r\nSo far all would be well, were it not that a grave difficulty arises.\r\nHowever active may be the mother-nurse, it is clear that she cannot\r\nmeet such a consumption of food. She has to be incessantly on the wing\r\nto feed one larva: what must happen if there are a dozen gluttons to\r\nprovide for? The result of this enormous increase of family can only be\r\nwant, or even famine, not for the larvæ of the Dipteron (which develop\r\nmore rapidly than that of the Bembex, profiting by the days when\r\nabundance still reigns, their host being yet in early youth), but for\r\nthe latter, who reaches the moment of metamorphosis without being able\r\nto make up for lost time. Besides, when the first guests become pupæ\r\nand leave the table free to it, others come, as long as the mother\r\nvisits the nest, and complete its starvation.\r\n\r\nIn burrows invaded by numerous parasites the Bembex larva is\r\nundoubtedly much smaller than one would expect from the heap of food\r\nconsumed, the remains of which encumber the cell. Limp, emaciated,—only\r\nhalf or a third of its proper size,—it vainly tries to spin a cocoon,\r\nthe silk for which it has not got, and it perishes in a corner of the\r\ncell, amid the pupæ of guests more fortunate than itself. Or its end\r\nmay be yet more tragic. Should provender fail, or the mother delay too\r\nlong in returning with food, the Diptera devour it. I ascertained this\r\nblack deed by bringing up the brood myself. All went well as long as\r\nfood was plentiful, but if through neglect, or on purpose, the daily\r\nsupply failed, next day or the day after I was sure to find the Diptera\r\nlarvæ greedily rending that of the Bembex. Thus, when the nest is\r\ninvaded by parasites, the legitimate larva is fated to perish either by\r\nhunger or a violent death, and this it is which makes the sight of\r\nMiltogramma prowling round the nest so odious to the Bembex.\r\n\r\nThe Bembex is not the only victim of these parasites: the burrows of\r\none and all of the mining Hymenoptera are invaded by Tachinids,\r\nespecially by the Miltogramma. Various observers—notably Lepeletier de\r\nSaint Fargeau—have spoken of the manœuvres of these impudent Diptera;\r\nbut as far as I know none have perceived the very curious case of\r\nparasitism at the expense of the Bembex—very curious, because the\r\nconditions are quite different. Nests of other Fossors are stored\r\nbeforehand, and the Miltogramma drops an egg on the prey just as it is\r\nbeing carried in. The provender stored and her egg laid, the\r\nHymenopteron closes up the cell where thenceforward live the legitimate\r\nlarva and the strangers, unvisited in their prison. Thus, the robbery\r\ncommitted by the parasite is unknown to the mother, and must\r\nconsequently remain unpunished.\r\n\r\nWith the Bembex it is quite otherwise. The mother constantly returns\r\nduring the fortnight that she is bringing up the larva; she knows that\r\nher offspring is living among numerous intruders, who appropriate the\r\ngreater part of the food; every time that she brings provender she\r\ntouches and feels at the bottom of her den these detestable guests,\r\nwho, far from contenting themselves with remains, seize what is best.\r\nShe must perceive, however small her powers of arithmetic may be, that\r\ntwelve are more than one; besides, she would discover this from the\r\ndisproportion between the consumption of food and her means of hunting,\r\nand yet, instead of seizing these bold intruders and bundling them out,\r\nshe serenely tolerates them. Tolerates! Why, she feeds them and brings\r\nthem their rations, and perhaps feels as much tenderness for them as\r\nfor her own larva. It is a new version of the cuckoo story in yet more\r\nsingular circumstances. The theory that the cuckoo, almost as big as a\r\nsparrowhawk and coloured like it, should look imposing enough to\r\nintroduce an egg unresisted into the nest of the weak hedge-sparrow,\r\nand that the latter, overawed perhaps by the alarming look of her\r\ntoad-faced nursling, should accept and care for the stranger, has\r\nsomething in its favour. But what shall we say of a sparrow which,\r\nturning parasite, should go with splendid audacity and intrust her eggs\r\nto the eyrie of a bird of prey—the nest of the sparrowhawk itself—the\r\nsanguinary devourer of sparrows? What should we say of the bird of prey\r\nwho should accept the charge and bring up the brood tenderly? It is\r\nprecisely thus that the Bembex acts,—she, a captor of Diptera who yet\r\nbrings up other Diptera—a huntress who distributes food to a prey whose\r\nlast repast will be her own disembowelled offspring! I leave to\r\ncleverer people the task of explaining these amazing relations.\r\n\r\nLet us observe the tactics employed by the Tachinid, whose object is to\r\nconfide her egg to the nest of the miner. It is an invariable rule that\r\nthe fly should never penetrate into the burrow, even if left open and\r\nthe owner absent. The crafty parasite would take good care not to\r\nentangle itself in a passage, where, having no possibility of flight,\r\nit might pay dearly for its effrontery. The only moment for its\r\ndesigns—a moment watched for with the greatest patience—is that when\r\nthe Hymenopteron enters the gallery, clasping her prey. At that\r\ninstant, brief as it is, when the Bembex or any other miner has half\r\nher body within the entrance, and is about to disappear underground,\r\nthe Miltogramma arrives on the wing, perches on the prey slightly,\r\nprojecting beyond the hinder end of the Bembex, and while she is\r\ndelayed by the difficulties of entering, the Miltogramma, with\r\nunparalleled promptitude, lays an egg on the prey, or two, or even\r\nthree eggs, successively. The hesitation of the Bembex, embarrassed by\r\nher load, lasts but the twinkling of an eye; but that matters not—it is\r\nlong enough for the fly to accomplish its misdeed without being dragged\r\nbeyond the threshold. What must not be the suppleness of organs to\r\nachieve this instantaneous laying of the egg! The Bembex disappears,\r\nherself introducing the enemy, and the Tachinid goes and crouches in\r\nthe sun, close to the burrow, and meditates fresh crimes. If one would\r\nmake sure that the Dipteron’s eggs have really been deposited during\r\nthis rapid manœuvre, it suffices to open the burrow and follow the\r\nBembex to the bottom of her abode. The prey which one takes from her\r\nbears underneath at least one egg—sometimes more, according to the\r\nlength of the delay at the entrance. These very minute eggs could only\r\nbelong to a parasite, and if any doubt remained, you can bring up the\r\nbrood in a box, and the result will be Diptera larvæ—later pupæ, and\r\nfinally Miltogramma.\r\n\r\nThe fly shows wonderful sagacity in the moment selected by it—the only\r\none which could permit of her carrying out her purpose with neither\r\nperil nor vain efforts. The Bembex, half-way through the entrance,\r\ncannot see her enemy audaciously perched on the hind quarters of the\r\nprey, or, if she suspects the bandit’s presence, cannot drive it away,\r\nhaving no freedom of movement in the strait passage, and in spite of\r\nall precautions to facilitate speedy entrance, cannot always vanish\r\nunderground with the celerity required, so quick is the parasite. In\r\nfact, this is the only propitious moment, since prudence forbids the\r\nDipteron to penetrate into the den, where other Diptera, far stronger\r\nthan itself, are served up as food for the larvæ. Outside, in the open\r\nair, the difficulty is insurmountable, so great is the vigilance of the\r\nBembex. Let us give a moment to the arrival of the mother, when the\r\nnest is being watched by the Miltogramma.\r\n\r\nSome of these flies—more or fewer, generally three or four—have settled\r\non the sand and are quite motionless, all gazing at the burrow, the\r\nentrance of which they know very well, carefully hid though it be.\r\nTheir dull-brown colour, their large crimson-red eyes, their intense\r\nstillness, have often made me think of bandits who, dressed in a dark\r\nmaterial, with a red kerchief over their heads, are lying in wait to do\r\nsome evil deed. The Hymenopteron comes, loaded with prey. Had she no\r\nanxieties she would alight straightway at her door. Instead, she hovers\r\nat a certain height, descends slowly and circumspectly, hesitates, and\r\nvibrates her wings, producing a plaintive hum denoting apprehension.\r\nShe must have seen the malefactors. They too have seen the Bembex. The\r\nmovement of their red heads shows that they are following her with\r\ntheir eyes; every gaze is fixed on the coveted booty. Then come marches\r\nand counter-marches of cunning versus prudence.\r\n\r\nThe Bembex drops straight down with an imperceptible flight, as if she\r\nlet herself sink gently, making a parachute of her wings. Now she is\r\nhovering just above the ground; the flies take wing, placing themselves\r\none and all behind her,—some nearer, some farther,—in a geometrical\r\nline. If she turns round to disconcert them, they turn too, with a\r\nprecision which keeps them all in the same straight line; if she\r\nadvances, so do they; if she draws back, they draw back too, measuring\r\ntheir flight, now slow, now stationary, on that of the Bembex at the\r\nhead of the file. They do not attempt to fling themselves on the\r\ndesired object, their tactics being merely to hold themselves in\r\nreadiness in the position of rearguard, so as to avoid any hesitation\r\nwhen the rapid final manœuvre shall come.\r\n\r\nSometimes, wearied out by their obstinate pursuit, the Bembex alights,\r\nand the flies instantly settle on the sand, still behind her, and keep\r\nquite still. She rises again, with a sharper hum—the sign no doubt of\r\nincreasing indignation; the flies follow her. One last means remains to\r\nthrow the tenacious Diptera off the track; the Bembex flies far\r\naway—perhaps hoping to mislead the parasites by rapid evolutions over\r\nthe fields. But the crafty flies are not taken in; they let her go, and\r\nsettle down again on the sand round the burrow. When the Bembex returns\r\nthe same manœuvres begin again until the obstinacy of the parasites has\r\nexhausted her prudence. At a moment when her vigilance fails, the flies\r\nare instantly there. Whichever is at the most favourable point drops\r\nupon the vanishing prey, and the thing is done—the egg is laid.\r\n\r\nThere is ample evidence that the Bembex is conscious of danger, and\r\nknows how disastrous for the future of her nest is the presence of the\r\nhated fly; her long efforts to throw the parasites off her track, her\r\nhesitation and flights, leave not a doubt on the subject. How is it\r\nthen, I ask myself once more, that the enemy of Diptera should allow\r\nherself to be annoyed by another Dipteron—a tiny robber, incapable of\r\nthe least resistance, which, if she chose, she could destroy instantly?\r\nWhy, when once free from the prey which hampers her, does she not\r\npounce on these ill-doers? What is needed to exterminate the evil brood\r\naround her burrow? Merely a battle which would take but a few instants.\r\nBut the harmony of those laws which govern the preservation of species\r\nwill not have it so, and the Bembex will always allow herself to be\r\nharassed without ever learning from the famous “struggle for life” the\r\nradical means of extermination. I have seen some which, pressed too\r\nclosely, let fall their prey and flew off wildly, but without any\r\nhostile demonstration, although dropping their game left them full\r\nliberty of action. The prey, so ardently desired a moment earlier by\r\nthe Tachinidæ, lay on the ground at the mercy of them all, and not one\r\ncared about it. It had no value for the flies, whose larvæ need the\r\nshelter of a burrow. It was valueless also to the Bembex, who came\r\nback, felt it for an instant and left it disdainfully. The little break\r\nin her custody of it had rendered her suspicious of it.\r\n\r\nLet us end this chapter by the history of the larva. Its monotonous\r\nlife offers nothing remarkable during the two weeks while it eats and\r\ngrows. Then comes making a cocoon. The slight development of\r\nsilk-producing organs does not allow of a dwelling of pure silk, like\r\nthose of the Ammophila and Sphegidæ—made of several wrappers which\r\nprotect the larva, and later the nymph, from damp in the ill-protected,\r\nshallow burrow during autumn rains and winter snows. Yet this Bembex\r\nburrow is in worse conditions than those of the Sphex, being made at a\r\ndepth of only a few inches in very permeable soil. To fashion a\r\nsufficient shelter the larva supplements by its industry the small\r\namount of silk at its disposal. With grains of sand artistically put\r\ntogether and connected by silky matter, it constructs a most solid\r\ncocoon—impenetrable to damp.\r\n\r\nThree general methods are employed by fossorial Hymenoptera to\r\nconstruct the dwelling in which metamorphosis is to take place. Some\r\nhollow burrows at a great depth under a shelter, and then the cocoon\r\nconsists of a single wrapper, so thin as to be transparent. Such is the\r\ncase with Philanthidæ and Cerceris. Others are content with a shallow\r\nburrow in open ground; but in that case they have silk enough for\r\nmanifold wrappings of the cocoon, as with Sphegidæ, Ammophila, and\r\nScolia; or if the quantity be insufficient, they use agglutinated\r\nsand—as, for instance, the Bembex and Palarus. One might take a Bembex\r\ncocoon for a solid kernel, so compact and resistant is it. The form is\r\ncylindrical—one end rounded, the other pointed. The length is about two\r\ncentimetres. Outside it is slightly wrinkled and coarse, but within the\r\nwalls are smoothed by a fine varnish.\r\n\r\nRearing at home has enabled me to follow every detail of the\r\nconstruction of this curious piece of architecture—a real strong box\r\nwhich can brave all the severity of the weather. First of all the larva\r\npushes away the remains of its feast into a corner of the cell, or the\r\ncompartment arranged for it in a box with paper partitions. Having\r\ncleared a space, it affixes to the walls of its abode threads of a\r\nbeautiful white silk, forming a spidery web which keeps the heap of\r\nfood-remains at a distance, and serves as scaffolding for the work to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nThis work consists of a hammock, suspended far from anything that can\r\ndefile it, in the centre of threads stretched from wall to wall. Fine,\r\nbeautiful white silk is the only material used. The shape is that of a\r\nsack open at one end, with a wide circular orifice, closed at the other\r\nand ending in a point; a fisherman’s basket gives a very fair idea of\r\nit. Then the edges of the aperture are permanently kept apart by\r\nnumerous threads fastened to the neighbouring walls. The tissue of the\r\nbag is extremely fine, allowing all that the grub does to be seen.\r\n\r\nThings had been in this state since the previous evening, when I heard\r\nthe larva scratching in the box. On opening, I found my captive busy\r\nscratching the cardboard walls with the tips of its mandibles, its body\r\nhalf out of the bag. Already it had made considerable progress, and a\r\nheap of little fragments were piled before the opening of the hammock,\r\nto be utilised later. For lack of other materials it would doubtless\r\nhave used these scrapings for its constructions, but I thought it\r\nbetter to provide according to its tastes and give it sand. Never did\r\nBembex larva build with such sumptuous material. I poured out for my\r\nprisoner sand for drying writing,—sand well sprinkled with gilded\r\ngrains of mica,—before the opening of the bag, which was in a\r\nhorizontal position, suitable to the work which would follow. The\r\nlarva, half out of its hammock, chose its sand almost grain by grain,\r\nrouting in the heap with its mandibles, and, if one too bulky presented\r\nitself, it was seized and cast aside. The sand being sorted, the larva\r\nintroduced a certain quantity with its mouth into the silken fabric,\r\nthen retired into its sack and began spreading the materials in a\r\nuniform layer on the inner surface, then glued together various grains\r\nand inlaid them in the fabric, with silk for cement. The outer surface\r\nwas constructed more slowly. These grains were carried singly and fixed\r\non with silk gum.\r\n\r\nThis first deposit of sand only concerns the anterior part of the\r\ncocoon—that half which ends in the opening. Before turning round to\r\nwork at the back part, the larva renews its store of materials and\r\ntakes certain precautions, so as not to be embarrassed in its masonry.\r\nThe sand heaped before the entrance might slip inside and hinder the\r\nbuilder in so narrow a space. The grub foresees this, and glues some\r\ngrains together, making a coarse curtain of sand, which stops up the\r\norifice, imperfectly indeed, but enough for the purpose. These\r\nprecautions taken, the grub labours at the back part of the cocoon.\r\nFrom time to time it turns round to get fresh materials from outside,\r\ntearing away a corner of the protecting curtain, and through this\r\nwindow grasping the materials needed. The cocoon is still\r\nincomplete—wide open at the upper end and without the spherical cap\r\nneeded to close it. For this final bit of work the grub provides itself\r\nabundantly with sand, and then pushes away the heap before the\r\nentrance. A silken cap is now woven and fitted close to the mouth of\r\nthis primitive basket. On this silken foundation are deposited, one by\r\none, the sand grains kept in the interior and cemented with\r\nsilk-spittle. This lid completed, the larva has only to give the last\r\nfinish to the interior of the dwelling and glaze the walls with\r\nvarnish, to protect its tender skin from the roughness of the sand.\r\n\r\nThe hammock of pure silk and the cap which later closes it are\r\nevidently only scaffolding intended to support the masonry of sand and\r\nto give it a regular curve. One might compare them to the constructions\r\nused by builders when making an arch or vault. The work being\r\ncompleted, the silken support disappears, partly lost in the masonry,\r\nand partly destroyed by contact with rough earth, and no trace remains\r\nof the ingenious method employed to put together a construction\r\nperfectly regular, yet made of a material so little coherent as is\r\nsand. The spherical cap which closes the original basket is a separate\r\nwork, adjusted to the main body of the cocoon. However well the two\r\npieces are fitted and soldered, the solidity is not such as the larva\r\nwould obtain had it built the whole dwelling continuously. Thus, on the\r\ncircumference of the cover there is a circular line less capable of\r\nresistance, but this is not a fault of construction. On the contrary it\r\nis a fresh perfection. The insect would experience grave difficulty in\r\nissuing from its strong box, so thick are the walls, did not the line\r\nof junction, weaker than the rest, apparently save much effort, as it\r\nis usually along this line that the cover is detached when the perfect\r\nBembex emerges.\r\n\r\nI have called the cocoon a strong box. It is indeed a solid article,\r\nboth from its shape and the nature of its materials. Landslips or\r\nfalling sand cannot alter its form, since the strongest pressure of\r\none’s fingers cannot always crush it. Thus it matters little to the\r\nlarva if the ceiling of its burrow, dug in loose soil, should sooner or\r\nlater fall in, and it need not fear, even should a passing foot press\r\ndown the thin covering of sand; it runs no risks when once enclosed in\r\nits stout shelter. Nor does damp endanger it. I have immersed Bembex\r\ncocoons for a fortnight in water without finding any trace of damp\r\ninside them. Ah! why cannot we have such waterproof for our dwellings?\r\nTo sum up: the cocoon, of graceful oval shape, appears rather the\r\nproduct of patient art than the work of a grub. For any one not behind\r\nthe scenes, the cocoons which I saw in process of construction with the\r\nsand from my inkstand might well have been precious articles of some\r\nunknown industry—great beads starred with golden dots on a ground of\r\nlapis lazuli, destined for the necklace of some Polynesian belle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\nTHE RETURN TO THE NEST\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ammophila digging her well late in the day leaves her work after\r\nstopping the entrance with a stone, flits away from one flower to\r\nanother, goes into a new neighbourhood, and yet next day can return\r\nwith a caterpillar to the abode hollowed out the evening before,\r\nnotwithstanding her want of acquaintance with the locality—often new to\r\nher; the Bembex, loaded with prey, alights with almost mathematical\r\nprecision on the threshold of a dwelling blocked by sand and rendered\r\nuniform with the rest of the sandy surface. Where my sight and memory\r\nare at fault, theirs have a certainty verging on infallibility. One\r\nwould say that the insect possessed something more subtle than mere\r\nrecollection—a kind of intuition of locality with which nothing in us\r\ncorresponds—in short, an indefinable faculty which I call memory for\r\nlack of any other expression by which to designate it. The unknown\r\ncannot be named. In order to throw if possible a little light on this\r\npoint in the psychology of animals I instituted a series of\r\nexperiments, which I will now describe.\r\n\r\nThe first had for its subject Cerceris tuberculata, which hunts the\r\nCleonus. About 10 a.m. I took a dozen females busy at the same bank and\r\nof the same colony, either hollowing or storing burrows. Each was\r\nenclosed in a twist of paper, and all were put into a box. About two\r\nkilometres from the nests I freed my captives, first marking them with\r\na white dot in the middle of the thorax by means of a straw dipped in\r\nan indelible colour, in order to recognise them later. They flew on\r\nevery side—some here, some there, but only a few paces, alighting on\r\nblades of grass and passing their forelegs over their eyes for a\r\nmoment, as if dazzled by the bright sunshine to which they were\r\nsuddenly restored. Then they took flight—some earlier, some later; and\r\none and all took unhesitatingly a straight line south, i.e. in the\r\ndirection of their home. Five hours later I returned to the common\r\nterritory of the nests. Almost directly I saw two of my white-dotted\r\nCerceris working at their burrows. Soon a third came in, with a weevil\r\nbetween her feet. A fourth soon followed—four out of twelve in a\r\nquarter of an hour was enough for conviction; I judged it useless to\r\nwait longer; what four could do, the others could, if indeed they had\r\nnot already done it, and one may very well suppose that the eight\r\nabsentees were out hunting, or perhaps had retired into the depths of\r\ntheir burrows. Thus, carried to a distance of two kilometres, in a\r\ndirection and by a way which they could not possibly perceive from the\r\ndepths of their paper prison, the Cerceris—at all events part of\r\nthem—had returned home.\r\n\r\nI do not know to what distance they go hunting; possibly they know the\r\ncountry round for some two kilometres. In that case they would not have\r\nbeen far enough away, and came home by their local knowledge. The\r\nexperiment had to be tried again at a greater distance, and from a\r\npoint which the Cerceris could not possibly know.\r\n\r\nI therefore took nine females from the colony whence I had got them in\r\nthe morning; three of these had been already experimented upon. Again\r\nthey were conveyed in a dark box—each imprisoned in a paper twist. The\r\nstarting-place was to be the neighbouring town of Carpentras, about\r\nthree kilometres from the burrows. I meant to release them not amid\r\nfields as before, but in a street in the midst of a populous quarter,\r\nwhere the Cerceris, with their rustic habits, had assuredly never\r\npenetrated. As the hour was late I put off the experiment, and my\r\ncaptives spent the night in their prison cells.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, towards eight o’clock, I marked them with a double\r\nwhite spot on the thorax to distinguish them from those of the evening\r\nbefore, which had only one, and set them free successively in the\r\nmiddle of the street. Each mounted vertically, as if to get as soon as\r\npossible from between the houses and gain a wide horizon, then rising\r\nabove the roofs, instantly and energetically turned its flight south.\r\nAnd it was from the south that I brought them into the town, and their\r\nburrows are south. Nine times with my nine prisoners did I obtain this\r\nstriking result—that an insect quite beyond its bearings should not\r\nhesitate a moment what direction to take to regain its nest.\r\n\r\nSome hours later I too was at the burrows. I saw several of my\r\nyesterday’s Cerceris with a white dot, but none of the last set free.\r\nHad they been unable to find the way back? Were they out hunting, or in\r\ntheir galleries recovering from the excitement of such a trial? I do\r\nnot know. The next morning I came again, and had the satisfaction of\r\nfinding at work, as active as if nothing extraordinary had happened to\r\nthem, five Cerceris with two white dots. Three kilometres of\r\ndistance,—the town with its houses, roofs, and smoky chimneys—all so\r\nnovel to my rustic Cerceris,—had proved no obstacle to their return\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nTaken from its brood and carried an enormous distance, the pigeon\r\nreturns promptly to its dovecote. If one were to consider the length of\r\njourney in proportion to the size of the animal, how superior to the\r\npigeon is the Cerceris carried away three kilometres and returning to\r\nits burrow! The size of the insect does not equal a cubic centimetre,\r\nwhile that of the pigeon must quite equal the cube of a decimetre, if\r\nit does not exceed it. The bird, a thousand times larger than the\r\nHymenopteron, ought, in order to rival it, to find its dovecote at a\r\ndistance of 3000 kilometres—thrice the greatest length of France from\r\nnorth to south. I do not know if a carrier-pigeon has ever shown such\r\nprowess, but wing-power and yet more lucidity of instinct cannot be\r\nmeasured by yards. Nor can we here consider the question of size, and\r\none can only see in the insect a worthy rival to the bird without\r\ndeciding which has the advantage.\r\n\r\nAre the two guided by memory when placed by man beyond their bearings\r\nand carried to great distances—into regions with which they are\r\nunacquainted and in unknown directions? Is memory as quick when, having\r\nreached a certain height at which they can in some sort take their\r\nbearings, they launch themselves with all their power of wing towards\r\nthat part of the horizon where are their nests? Is it memory which\r\ntraces their aerial way across regions seen for the first time?\r\nEvidently not. It is not possible to recollect the unknown. The\r\nHymenopteron and the bird know nothing of their surroundings; nothing\r\ncan have taught them the general direction which they followed when\r\ncarried thither, for it was in the darkness of a closed box that the\r\njourney was made. Locality, orientation,—all is unknown, and yet they\r\nfind their way. They have then as guide something better than simple\r\nmemory—a special faculty, a kind of topographic consciousness of which\r\nwe can form no idea, possessing nothing analogous to it.\r\n\r\nI am now about to establish experimentally how subtle and precise is\r\nthis faculty in the narrow cycle where it is applied, and also how\r\nlimited and obtuse when it has to move out of habitual conditions. Such\r\nis the invariable antithesis of instinct.\r\n\r\nA Bembex, actively engaged in feeding her larva, has left her burrow.\r\nShe will return immediately with the product of the chase. The entrance\r\nis carefully stopped with sand—swept backward by the insect before\r\ndeparting. Nothing distinguishes it from the rest of the sandy surface.\r\nBut this offers no difficulty to the Hymenopteron, who finds her\r\ndoorway again with a sagacity which I have already described. Let us\r\nplan some treachery; let us perplex her by altering the state of the\r\nplace. I cover the entrance with a flat stone as large as my hand. She\r\nsoon returns. The complete change made upon her threshold during her\r\nabsence does not seem to cause her the slightest hesitation; at all\r\nevents she alights immediately upon the stone, and tries for an instant\r\nto hollow it, not at a chance spot, but exactly over the opening of her\r\nburrow. Quickly turned aside from this attempt by the hardness of the\r\nobstacle, she traverses the stone in every direction, goes round it,\r\nslips underneath, and begins to dig in the precise direction of her\r\ndwelling.\r\n\r\nThe flat stone is too trifling an obstacle to disconcert the clever\r\nfly; let us find something better. I did not allow the Bembex to\r\ncontinue her excavation, which I saw would soon prove successful, and\r\ndrove her far off with my handkerchief. The absence of the frightened\r\ninsect for a considerable time allowed me to prepare my snares\r\nleisurely. What materials must now be employed? In these improvised\r\nexperiments one must know how to turn all things to profit. Not far off\r\non the high road is the fresh dropping of a beast of burden; here is\r\nwood for our arrow. The dropping was collected, crushed, and spread in\r\na layer at least an inch thick on the threshold of the burrow and its\r\nsurroundings over more than a quarter of a yard. Assuredly here was\r\nsuch a façade as never Bembex knew. Colour, the nature of the material,\r\nthe effluvium,—all combined to deceive the Hymenopteron. Can she take\r\nthis stretch of manure—this dung—for the front of the dwelling? She\r\ndoes! Here she comes; studying from above the unusual condition of the\r\nplace, and settling in the middle of the layer, just opposite the\r\nentrance, routing about, making a way through the fibrous mass, and\r\npenetrating to the sand, she promptly discovers the mouth of the\r\npassage. I stop and drive her away a second time.\r\n\r\nIs not the precision with which the Bembex settles before her dwelling,\r\nthough masked in a way so novel, a proof that sight and memory are not\r\nin such a case the only guides? What further can there be? Smell,\r\nperhaps. That is very doubtful, for the emanations from the dung could\r\nnot baffle the perspicacity of the insect. Nevertheless, let us try\r\nanother odour. I happen to have with me, as part of my entomological\r\noutfit, a little phial of ether. The covering of manure is swept off\r\nand replaced by a cushion of moss, not very thick, but covering a wide\r\nsurface, on which I pour the contents of my phial the moment I see the\r\nBembex coming. The over-strong emanations keep her off, but only for an\r\ninstant. She alights on the moss, still reeking of ether, traverses the\r\nobstacle and penetrates to her dwelling. The etherised effluvia did not\r\ndisturb her any more than did those of the manure; something surer than\r\nsmell tells where her nest is.\r\n\r\nThe antennæ have been often suggested as the seat of a special sense to\r\nguide insects. I have already shown how the suppression of these organs\r\nappears to offer no obstacle to the researches of the Hymenoptera. Let\r\nus try once more in wider conditions. The Bembex is caught, its antennæ\r\namputated to the roots, and is then released. Stung by the pain—wild\r\nwith terror at being held between my fingers—the insect flies off\r\nswifter than an arrow. I had to wait a whole hour, uncertain as to its\r\nreturn. However, it came, and with its invariable precision alighted\r\nquite close to its doorway, whose look I had changed for the fourth\r\ntime, having covered the site with a large mosaic of pebbles the size\r\nof a nut. My work, which, compared to the Bembex, surpassed what for us\r\nare the Megalithic monuments of Brittany, or the lines of Menhirs at\r\nCarnac, was powerless to deceive the mutilated insect. Though deprived\r\nof antennæ it found the entrance in the midst of my mosaic as easily as\r\nwould have done an insect under other conditions. This time I let the\r\nfaithful mother go home in peace.\r\n\r\nThe site transformed four times over, the outworks of the abode changed\r\nin colour, scent, and material, the pain of a double wound,—all failed\r\nto disconcert the Hymenopteron or even to make her doubtful as to the\r\nprecise locality of her doorway. I had exhausted my stratagems, and\r\nunderstood less than ever how the insect, if it have no special guide\r\nin some faculty unknown to us, can find its way when sight and smell\r\nare baffled by the artifices of which I have spoken. Some days later an\r\nexperience gave me the opportunity to take up the problem from a new\r\npoint of view. The Bembex burrow had to be bared in its whole extent,\r\nwithout quite destroying it, to which operation its shallowness and\r\nalmost horizontal direction, and the light soil in which it was made,\r\nlent themselves readily. The sand was gradually scraped off with the\r\nblade of a knife, and thus, deprived of roof from end to end, the\r\nunderground abode became a semi-canal or conduit, straight or curved,\r\nsome eight inches long, open where was the entrance, and ending in a\r\ncul-de-sac where lay the larva amid its food.\r\n\r\nThe dwelling was uncovered in full sunshine; how would the mother\r\nbehave on her return? Let us consider the question scientifically. The\r\nobserver may be greatly embarrassed: what I have already seen leads me\r\nto expect it. The mother’s impulse is to bring food to her larva, but\r\nto reach this larva she must first find the door. Grub and entrance are\r\nthe points which appear to deserve being separately examined; therefore\r\nI take away grub and food, and the end of the passage is cleared. There\r\nis nothing more to do but arm one’s self with patience.\r\n\r\nAt last the Bembex arrives and makes straight for her absent door, only\r\nthe threshold of which remains. There for a good hour did I see her\r\ndig, sweep the surface, send the sand flying, and persist, not in\r\nmaking a new gallery, but in seeking the loose sand barrier which\r\nshould yield to the mere pressure of her head and let her pass easily.\r\nInstead of loose materials she finds firm soil not yet disturbed.\r\nWarned by this resistance she limits her efforts to exploring the\r\nsurface, always close to where the door should be, only allowing\r\nherself to deviate a few inches. She returns to sound and sweep places\r\nalready sounded and swept some twenty times, unable to leave her narrow\r\ncircle, so obstinately convinced is she that the door must be there and\r\nnowhere else. With a straw I pushed her gently and repeatedly to\r\nanother point. She would have none of it, and came back at once to\r\nwhere the door ought to have been. Now and then the gallery, turned\r\ninto a semi-canal, appeared to attract her attention, but very faintly.\r\nShe would go a few steps along it, still raking, and then return to the\r\nentrance. Two or three times I saw her go the whole length of the\r\ngallery and reach the cul-de-sac where the larva should be, do a little\r\ncareless raking, and hurry back where the entrance used to be, and\r\ncontinue searching with a patience which exhausted mine. More than an\r\nhour had passed, and still she sought on the site whence the door had\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nWhat would happen in the presence of the larva? That was the second\r\npart of the question. To continue the experiment with the same Bembex\r\nwould not have offered sufficient guarantee, as the creature, rendered\r\nmore obstinate by her vain search, seemed possessed by a fixed idea,\r\nand this would have interfered with the facts which I wanted to prove.\r\nI required a new subject, concerned solely with the impulses of the\r\nactual moment. An opportunity soon came. The burrow was uncovered, as I\r\nhave just said; but I did not touch the contents; larva and food were\r\nleft in their places,—all was in order inside, the roof only was\r\nwanting. Well, with this open dwelling, whose every detail the eye\r\ncould embrace,—vestibule, gallery, cell at the far end, with the grub\r\nand its heap of provender,—this dwelling turned into a roofless gallery\r\nat the end of which the larva was moving restlessly, under the hot sun,\r\nits mother continued the manœuvres already described. She alighted just\r\nwhere the entrance had been, and there it was that she hunted about and\r\nswept the sand—there that she always returned after some hasty attempt\r\nelsewhere in a circuit of a few inches. No exploration of the\r\ngallery—no anxiety for the distressed larva; though the grub, whose\r\ndelicate skin has just exchanged the gentle moisture of a cave for\r\nburning sunshine, is writhing on its heap of chewed Diptera, the mother\r\ntakes no notice of it. For her it is no more than any one of the\r\nobjects strewn on the sand,—a little pebble, a clod, a scrap of dried\r\nmud,—nothing more. It is undeserving of attention. This tender,\r\nfaithful mother, who wears herself out in efforts to reach her\r\nnursling’s cradle, cares nothing just now but for her entrance door—the\r\ndoor she is used to. That which goes to her maternal heart is the\r\nlonging to find the well-known passage. Yet the way is open; nothing\r\nholds her back, and under her eyes wriggles the grub, the final object\r\nof her anxiety. With one spring she would be at the side of the unhappy\r\nlarva who so needs help. Why does she not rush to her beloved nursling?\r\nShe could dig a new habitation and get it swiftly underground. But\r\nno—she persists in seeking a way which no longer exists, while her son\r\nis grilled under her eyes. I was boundlessly surprised by this obtuse\r\nmaternity, since maternity is the most powerful and most fertile in\r\nresource of all feelings which move the animal. Hardly could I have\r\nbelieved my eyes but for endless experiments on the Cerceris and\r\nPhilanthidæ, as well as on Bembecidæ of different species. Stranger\r\nstill, the mother, after long hesitation, at length entered the\r\nunroofed passage—all that was left of the corridor. She advanced, drew\r\nback, and gave a few careless sweeps without stopping. Guided by vague\r\nrecollections, and perhaps by the smell of venison exhaled from the\r\nheap of Diptera, she came occasionally as far as the end of the\r\ngallery, the very spot where lay the larva. Mother and son had met. At\r\nthis moment of reunion after long anxiety, were there earnest\r\nsolicitude, sign of tenderness, or of maternal joy? Whoever thinks so\r\nhas only to repeat my experiment to convince himself of the contrary.\r\nThe Bembex did not recognise her larva at all; it was a worthless\r\nthing, in her way,—nothing but an embarrassment. She walked over it and\r\ntrampled it unheeding, as she hurried backwards and forwards. If she\r\nwanted to dig at the bottom of the cell, she rudely kicked it behind\r\nher,—pushed, upset, expelled it, as she might have treated a large bit\r\nof gravel which got in her way while at work. Thus maltreated, the\r\nlarva bethought itself of defence. I have seen it seize her by one\r\ntarsus with no more ceremony than she would have shown in biting the\r\nfoot of a Dipteron caught by her. The struggle was sharp, but at last\r\nthe fierce mandibles let go, and the mother flew wildly away with her\r\nsharpest hum. This unnatural scene of the son biting the mother, and\r\nperhaps even trying to eat her, is unusual, and brought about by\r\ncircumstances which the observer is not always able to conjure up. What\r\none can always witness is the profound indifference of the Hymenopteron\r\nfor its offspring, and the brutal disdain with which that inconvenient\r\nheap, the grub, is treated. Once she has raked out the far end of the\r\npassage, which is done in a moment, the Bembex returns to her favourite\r\npoint, the threshold, to resume her useless researches. As for the\r\ngrub, it continues to struggle and wriggle wherever the maternal kicks\r\nmay have landed it. It will perish unaided by its mother, who could not\r\nrecognise it because she was unable to find the passage she was used\r\nto. If we return to-morrow, we shall find it in the gallery,\r\nhalf-broiled by the sun, and already a prey to the flies—once its own\r\nprey.\r\n\r\nSuch is the connection in acts of instinct; one leading to the next in\r\nan order that the most serious circumstances have no power to alter.\r\nAfter all, what was the Bembex seeking? Her larva, evidently. But to\r\nreach this larva she had to enter the burrow, and to enter the burrow\r\nshe had to find the door, and the mother persists in seeking this door\r\nwhile the gallery lay open with provender and larva all before her. The\r\nruined abode, the endangered family, were for the moment unimportant;\r\nall she could think of was the familiar passage reached through loose\r\nsand. Let all go—habitation and inhabitant—if this passage be not\r\nfound! Her actions are like a series of echoes, awaking one another in\r\na fixed order, the following one only sounding when the preceding has\r\nsounded. Not because there was any obstacle; the burrow was all open,\r\nbut for want of the usual entrance the first action could not take\r\nplace. That decides everything; the first echo is mute, and so all the\r\nrest are silent. What a gulf between intelligence and instinct! Through\r\nthe ruins of the shattered dwelling a mother guided by intelligence\r\nrushes straight to her son; guided by instinct she stops obstinately\r\nwhere once was the door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\nMASON BEES\r\n\r\n\r\nRéaumur has dedicated one of his studies to the Chalicodoma of walls,\r\nwhich he calls the Mason Bee. I propose to resume this study, to\r\ncomplete it, and especially to consider it from a point of view\r\nentirely neglected by that illustrious observer. And first of all I am\r\ntempted to state how I made acquaintance with this Hymenopteron. It was\r\nwhen I first began to teach—towards A.D. 1843. On leaving the Normal\r\nSchool of Vaucluse a few months previously, with my certificate, and\r\nthe naïve enthusiasm of eighteen, I was sent to Carpentras to manage\r\nthe primary school belonging to the college. A singular school it was,\r\nupon my word, notwithstanding its fine title of “Upper”!—a kind of vast\r\ncellar breathing out the damp engendered by a fountain backing on it in\r\nthe street. Light came in through a door opening outward when the\r\nweather allowed of it, and a narrow prison-window, with iron-bars, and\r\nlittle diamond panes set in lead. For seats there was a plank fastened\r\nto the walls all round the room; in the middle was a chair guiltless of\r\nstraw, a blackboard, and a bit of chalk.\r\n\r\nMorning and evening, at the sound of a bell, there tumbled in some\r\nfifty young rascals, who, having failed to master De viris and the\r\nEpitome, were devoting themselves, as one said then, to “some good\r\nyears of French.” The failures at “Rosa, a Rose,” came to me to learn a\r\nlittle spelling. Children were mingled with tall lads at various stages\r\nof education, and all distressingly agreed in playing tricks on the\r\nmaster—no older, even younger, than some of themselves.\r\n\r\nI taught the little ones to read syllables, the middle ones to hold a\r\npen in the right way while writing a few words of dictation on their\r\nknees; for the eldest I unveiled the secrets of fractions, and even the\r\nmysteries of the hypotenuse. And the only means I had to keep this\r\nrestless crowd in order, give each mind appropriate food, arouse\r\nattention, expel dulness from the gloomy room whose very walls dripped\r\nmelancholy, were my tongue and a bit of chalk.\r\n\r\nFor that matter there was equal disdain in the other classes for all\r\nwhich was not Latin or Greek. One instance will suffice to show the\r\nstyle in which physical science was treated, now so large a part of\r\neducation. The principal of this college was an excellent man—the\r\nworthy Abbé X, who, not anxious himself to grow green peas and bacon,\r\nturned over such matters to some relation of his, and undertook to\r\nteach physical science.\r\n\r\nLet us attend one of his lessons, which happens to be on the barometer.\r\nBy good luck the college owned one. It was an old article, very dusty,\r\nhung high out of reach of profane hands, and bearing on its face in\r\nlarge letters the words, Storm, Rain, Fine. “The barometer,” began the\r\ngood abbé, addressing himself to his disciples—he used a fatherly\r\nsecond person singular to each,—“the barometer gives notice of good or\r\nbad weather. Thou seest the words written here—Storm, Rain—thou seest,\r\nBastien?” “I see,” replies Bastien, the most mischievous of the troop.\r\nHe has run through his book, and knows more about the barometer than\r\ndoes his professor. “It is composed,” the abbé goes on, “of a curved\r\nglass tube full of mercury which rises and falls according to the\r\nweather. The small branch of this tube is open; the other—the other—we\r\nshall see as to the other. Bastien—Get on this chair, and just feel\r\nwith the tip of thy finger if the long branch is open or closed. I do\r\nnot quite remember.” Bastien goes to the chair, stands as high as he\r\ncan on tip-toe, and feels the top of the long column with a finger tip.\r\nThen, with a slight smile under the down of his dawning moustache, he\r\nreplies, “Yes, exactly; yes, the long branch is open at the top. I can\r\nfeel the hollow.” And to corroborate his mendacious statement he went\r\non moving his forefinger on the top of the tube, while his\r\nco-disciples, accomplices in mischief, stifled their laughter as best\r\nthey could. The abbé said calmly, “That will do. Come down, Bastien.\r\nGentlemen, write in your notes that the long branch of the barometer is\r\nopen. You might forget it. I had forgotten it myself.”\r\n\r\nThus were physics taught. Things mended, however; a master came, and\r\ncame to stay,—one who knew that the long branch of a barometer is\r\nclosed. I obtained tables on which my pupils could write instead of\r\nscrawling on their knees, and as my class grew daily larger, it ended\r\nby being divided. As soon as I had an assistant to look after the\r\nyounger ones, things changed for the better.\r\n\r\nAmong the subjects taught, one pleased master and pupils equally. This\r\nwas out-of-door geometry, practical surveying. The college had none of\r\nthe necessary outfit, but with my large emoluments—700 francs, if you\r\nplease!—I could not hesitate as to making the outlay. A measuring chain\r\nand stakes, a level, square, and compass were bought at my expense. A\r\ntiny graphometer, hardly bigger than one’s palm, and worth about 4s.\r\n2d., was furnished by the college. We had no tripod, and I had one\r\nmade. In short, my outfit was complete. When May came, once a week the\r\ngloomy class-room was exchanged for the fields, and we all felt it as a\r\nholiday. There were disputes as to the honour of carrying the stakes,\r\ndivided into packets of three, and more than one shoulder as we went\r\nthrough the town felt glorified in the sight of all by the learned\r\nburden. I myself—why conceal it?—was not without a certain satisfaction\r\nat carrying tenderly the most precious part of the apparatus, the\r\nfamous four-and-twopenny graphometer. The scene of operations was an\r\nuncultivated pebbly plain—a harmas, as we call it in these parts. No\r\ncurtain of live hedge, no bushes, hindered me from keeping an eye upon\r\nmy followers; here—an all important condition—I need not fear\r\ntemptation from green apricots for my scholars. There was free scope\r\nfor all imaginable polygons; trapezes and triangles might be joined at\r\nwill. Wide distances suggested plenty of elbow room, and there was even\r\nan ancient building, once a dovecote, which lent its vertical lines to\r\nthe service of the graphometer.\r\n\r\nNow from the very first a suspicious something caught my attention. If\r\na scholar were sent to plant a distant stake I saw him frequently\r\npause, stoop, rise, seek about, and stoop again, forgetful of straight\r\nline and of signals. Another, whose work it was to pick up pegs, forgot\r\nthe iron spike and took a pebble instead; and a third, deaf to the\r\nmeasurements of the angle, crumbled up a clod. The greater number were\r\ncaught licking a bit of straw, and polygons stood still, and diagonals\r\ncame to grief. What could be the mystery? I inquired, and all was\r\nexplained. Searcher and observer born, the scholar was well aware of\r\nwhat the master was ignorant of—namely, that a great black bee makes\r\nearthen nests on the pebbles of the harmas, and that in these nests\r\nthere is honey. My surveyors were opening and emptying the cells with a\r\nstraw. I was instructed in the proper method. The honey, though\r\nsomewhat strong-flavoured, is very acceptable; I in turn acquired a\r\ntaste for it, and joined the nest-hunters. Later, the polygon was\r\nresumed. Thus it was that for the first time I saw Réaumur’s Mason Bee,\r\nknowing neither its history nor its historian.\r\n\r\nThis splendid Hymenopteron, with its dark violet wings and costume of\r\nblack velvet, its rustic constructions on the sun-warmed pebbles among\r\nthe thyme, its honey, which brought diversion from the severities of\r\ncompass and square, made a strong impression on my mind, and I wished\r\nto know more about it than my pupils had taught me—namely, how to rob\r\nthe cells of their honey with a straw. Just then my bookseller had for\r\nsale a magnificent work on insects, The Natural History of Articulated\r\nAnimals, by de Castelnau, E. Blanchard, and Lucas. It was enriched with\r\nmany engravings which caught the eye. But alas, it had a price—such a\r\nprice! What did that matter? My 700 francs ought surely to suffice for\r\neverything—food for the mind as well as for the body. That which I\r\nbestowed on the one I retrenched from the other—a balance of accounts\r\nto which whoever takes science for a livelihood must needs resign\r\nhimself. The purchase was made. That day I bled my university stipend\r\nabundantly; I paid away a whole month of it. It took a miracle of\r\nparsimony to fill up the enormous deficit.\r\n\r\nThe book was devoured—I can use no other word. There I learned the name\r\nof my black bee, and there I read for the first time details of the\r\nhabits of insects, and found, with what seemed to my eyes an aureole\r\nround them, the venerated names of Réaumur, Huber, Léon Dufour; and\r\nwhile I turned the pages for the hundredth time, a voice whispered\r\nvaguely, “Thou too shalt be a historian of animals!” Naïve illusions!\r\nwhere are you? But let us banish these recollections, both sweet and\r\nsad, and come to the doings of our black bee.\r\n\r\nChalicodoma, house of pebbles, rough-cast mortar, a name which would be\r\nperfect did it not look odd to any one not well up in Greek. It is a\r\nname applied to those Hymenoptera that build cells with materials such\r\nas we use for our dwellings. It is masonry, but made by a rustic\r\nworkman, better used to dried clay than to hewn stone. A stranger to\r\nscientific classification (and this causes great obscurity in some of\r\nhis memoirs), Réaumur called the worker after the work, and named our\r\nbuilders in dried clay Mason Bees, which paints them exactly. We have\r\ntwo kinds, C. muraria, whose history is admirably given by Réaumur, and\r\nC. sicula, which is not special to the land of Etna, as the name\r\nsuggests, but is found in Greece, Algeria, and the Mediterranean region\r\nof France, especially in the department of Vaucluse, where in May it is\r\none of the most common Hymenoptera. The two sexes of C. muraria are so\r\nunlike in colouring that a novice observing both coming out of the same\r\nnest would take them for strangers to one another. The female is of a\r\nsplendid velvet black, with dark violet wings; in the male the black\r\nvelvet is replaced by a bright iron-red fleece. The second species—a\r\nmuch smaller one—has not this difference of colour, both sexes wearing\r\nthe same costume—a general mixture of brown, red, and ashy tints. Both\r\nbegin to build in the beginning of May. The wing-tips, washed with\r\nviolet on a bronze ground, faintly recall the rich purple of the first\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nAs Réaumur tells us, C. muraria in the northern provinces chooses as\r\nthe place to fix her nest a wall well exposed to the sun and not\r\nplastered, as the plaster might come off and endanger her cells. She\r\nonly entrusts her constructions to a solid foundation, such as a bare\r\nstone. I see that she is equally prudent in the south, but, for some\r\nreason unknown to me, she generally chooses some other base than the\r\nstone of a wall. A rolled pebble, often hardly larger than one’s\r\nfist,—one of those with which the waters of the glacial period covered\r\nthe terraces of the Rhône valley,—is her favourite support. The great\r\nease with which such a one is found may influence her; all our slightly\r\nraised plateaux, all our arid thyme-clad ground, are but heaped pebbles\r\ncemented with red earth. In the valleys the bee can also use the stones\r\ngathered in torrent beds; near Orange, for instance, her favourite\r\nspots are the alluviums of the Aygues, with their stretches of rolled\r\nboulders no longer visited by water. Or if a pebble be wanting, she\r\nwill establish her nest on a boundary stone or an enclosing wall.\r\n\r\nChalicodoma sicula has a yet greater variety of choice. Her favourite\r\nposition is under a tile projecting from the edge of a roof. There is\r\nscarcely a little dwelling in the fields that does not thus shelter her\r\nnests. There, every spring, she establishes populous colonies, whose\r\nmasonry, transmitted from one generation to another, and yearly\r\nenlarged, finally covers a very considerable surface. I have seen such\r\na one under the tiles of a shed, which spread over five or six square\r\nyards. When the colony were hard at work, their number and humming\r\nfairly made one dizzy. The underpart of a balcony pleases them equally,\r\nor the frame of an unused window,—above all, if closed by a\r\nsun-shutter, which offers a free passage. But these are great\r\nmeeting-places, where labour, each for herself, hundreds and thousands\r\nof workers. If alone, which not seldom occurs, Chalicodoma sicula\r\nestablishes herself in the first little spot she can find, so long as\r\nit has a solid basis and heat. As for the nature of this basis it\r\nmatters little. I have seen nests built on bare stones and brick, on a\r\nshutter, and even on the glass panes in a shed. One thing only does not\r\nsuit the bee—namely, the stucco of our houses. Prudent, like her\r\nretainer C. muraria, she would fear ruin to her cells did she entrust\r\nthem to a support which might fall.\r\n\r\nFinally, for reasons which I cannot yet satisfactorily explain, C.\r\nsicula often entirely changes her manner of building, turning her heavy\r\nmortar dwelling, which seems to require a rock to support it, into an\r\naerial one, hung to a bough. A bush in a hedge,—no matter\r\nwhat—hawthorn, pomegranate, or Paliurus,—offers a support, usually\r\nabout the height of a man, Ilex and elm give a greater height. The bee\r\nchooses in some thicket a bough about as thick as a straw, and\r\nconstructs her edifice on this narrow base with the same mortar which\r\nwould be used under a balcony or the projecting edge of a roof. When\r\nfinished, the nest is a ball of earth, traversed literally by the\r\nbough. If made by a single insect it is the size of an apricot, and of\r\na fist if several have worked at it; but this seldom occurs.\r\n\r\nBoth species use the same materials, a calcareous clay, mixed with a\r\nlittle sand and kneaded with the mason’s own saliva. Damp spots which\r\nwould facilitate labour and spare saliva to mix mortar are disdained by\r\nthe Chalicodoma, which refuses fresh earth for building, just as our\r\nbuilders refuse old plaster and lime. Such materials when soaked with\r\nhumidity would not hold properly. What is needed is a dry powder, which\r\nreadily absorbs the disgorged saliva, and forms with the albuminous\r\nprinciples of this liquid a kind of Roman cement, hardening\r\nquickly,—something like what we obtain with quicklime and white of egg.\r\n\r\nA beaten road, formed of calcareous boulders crushed by passing wheels\r\ninto a smooth surface like paving stones, is the quarry whence\r\nChalicodoma sicula prefers to get mortar; whether she builds on a\r\nbranch, in a hedge, or under the jutting roof of some rural habitation,\r\nit is always from a neighbouring path, or a road, or the highway, that\r\nshe seeks materials—indifferent to the constant passing of beasts and\r\ntravellers. You should see the active bee at work when the road is\r\ndazzling white in the hot sunshine. Between the neighbouring farm where\r\nshe is building and the road where the mortar is prepared, there is the\r\ndeep hum of the bees perpetually crossing each other as they come and\r\ngo. The air seems traversed by constant trails of smoke, so rapid and\r\ndirect is their flight. Those who go carry away a pellet of mortar as\r\nbig as small shot; those who come settle on the hardest and driest\r\nspots. Their whole body vibrates as they scratch with the tips of their\r\nmandibles, and rake with their forefeet to extract atoms of earth and\r\ngrains of sand, which, being rolled between their teeth, become moist\r\nwith saliva and unite. They work with such ardour that they will let\r\nthemselves be crushed under the foot of a passer-by rather than move.\r\nChalicodoma muraria, however, which seeks solitude, far from human\r\nhabitation, is rarely seen on beaten paths; perhaps they are too\r\ndistant from the places where she builds. If she can find dry earth,\r\nrich in small gravel, near the boulder chosen as the basis of her nest,\r\nshe is contented. She may either make quite a new nest in a spot\r\nhitherto unoccupied, or over the cells of an old one, after repairing\r\nthem. Let us consider the first case.\r\n\r\nAfter choosing a boulder, she comes with a pellet of mortar in her\r\nmandibles, and arranges it in a ring on the surface of the pebble. The\r\nforefeet, and above all the mandibles, which are her most important\r\ntools, work the material, which is kept plastic by the gradually\r\ndisgorged saliva. To consolidate the unbaked clay, angular pieces of\r\ngravel, as large as a small bean, are worked in singly on the outside\r\nof the still soft mass. This is the foundation of the edifice. Other\r\nlayers are added until the cell has the required height of three or\r\nfour centimetres. The masonry is formed by stones laid on one another\r\nand cemented with lime, and can stand comparison with our own. True, to\r\neconomise labour and mortar, the bee uses coarse materials,—large bits\r\nof gravel, which in her case answer to hewn blocks. They are chosen\r\nsingly—very hard ones, almost always with angles which, fitted\r\ntogether, give mutual support, and add solidity to the whole. Layers of\r\nmortar, sparingly used, hold them together. The outside of the cell\r\nthus assumes the look of a piece of rustic architecture, in which\r\nstones project with their natural inequalities; but over the inside,\r\nwhich requires a smoother surface in order not to wound the tender skin\r\nof the larva, is spread a wash of pure mortar—artlessly, however, as if\r\nby broad sweeps of a trowel; and when it has eaten up its honey paste,\r\nthe grub takes care to make a cocoon and hang the rude wall of its\r\nabode with silk. The Anthophora and Halictus, whose larvæ spin no\r\ncocoon, varnish the inside of their earthen cells delicately, giving\r\nthem the polish of worked ivory.\r\n\r\nThe construction, the axis of which is always nearly vertical, with an\r\norifice opening upward, so that the fluid honey may not run out,\r\ndiffers a little in form, according to its basis. On a horizontal\r\nsurface it rises like a little oval tower; on a vertical or slanting\r\none it resembles half a thimble cut down its length. In this case the\r\nsupport—the pebble itself—completes the surrounding wall. The cell\r\ncompleted, the bee sets to work at once to store it. The neighbouring\r\nflowers, especially those of Genista scorpius, which in May turn the\r\nalluviums of the torrents golden, furnish sugared liquid and pollen.\r\nShe comes with her crop swelled with honey, and all yellow underneath\r\nwith pollen dust, and plunges head first into the cell, where for some\r\nmoments one may see her work her body in a way which tells that she is\r\ndisgorging honey. Her crop emptied, she comes out, but only to go in\r\nagain at once—this time backwards. With her two hind feet she now frees\r\nherself from her load, of pollen by brushing herself underneath. Again\r\nshe goes out, and returns head first. She must stir the materials with\r\nher mandibles for a spoon, and mix all thoroughly together. This labour\r\nof mixing is not repeated after every journey, but only from time to\r\ntime, when a considerable quantity has been collected. When the cell is\r\nhalf full, it is stored; an egg must be laid on the honey paste, and\r\nthe door has to be closed. This is all done without delay. The orifice\r\nis closed by a cover of undiluted mortar, worked from the circumference\r\nto the centre. Two days at most seem required for the whole work,\r\nunless bad weather or a cloudy day should interrupt it. Then, backing\r\non the first cell, a second is built and stored in the same way, and a\r\nthird and fourth, etc., follow, each one with honey and an egg, and\r\nclosed before another is begun. Work once begun is continued until it\r\nis completed, the bee never building a new cell until the four acts\r\nrequired to perfect the preceding one are performed—namely,\r\nconstruction, provisioning, an egg, and sealing the cell.\r\n\r\nAs Chalicodoma muraria always works alone on her chosen boulder, and\r\nshows great jealousy if her neighbours alight there, the number of\r\ncells clustered on one pebble is not great—usually six to ten. Are some\r\neight larvæ her whole progeny, or will she establish a more numerous\r\nfamily on other boulders? The surface of the stone would allow of more\r\ncells if she had eggs for them, and the bee might build there very\r\ncomfortably without hunting for another, or leaving the one to which\r\nshe is attached by habit and long acquaintance. I think, therefore,\r\nthat most probably all her scanty family are settled on the same\r\nstone—at all events when she builds a new abode.\r\n\r\nThe six or ten cells composing the group are certainly a solid\r\ndwelling, with their rustic covering of gravel, but the thickness of\r\ntheir walls and lids—two millimetres at most—hardly seems sufficient\r\nagainst rough weather. Set on its stone in the open air, quite\r\nunsheltered, the nest will undergo the heat of summer suns which will\r\nturn every cell into an oven; then will come the autumn rains which\r\nwill slowly eat away the masonry, and then winter frosts which will\r\ncrumble what the rain may have respected. However hard the cement may\r\nbe, can it resist all these attacks, and if it can, will not the larvæ,\r\nsheltered by so thin a wall, suffer from over-heat in summer and too\r\nkeen cold in winter?\r\n\r\nWithout having gone through all these arguments, the bee acts wisely.\r\nWhen all the cells are completed she builds a thick cover over the\r\nwhole group, which, being of a material impermeable to water and almost\r\na non-conductor, is at once a defence against heat and cold and damp.\r\nThis material is the usual mortar, made of earth and saliva, only with\r\nno small stones in it. The bee lays it on,—one pellet after another,\r\none trowelful and then a second,—till there is a layer a centimetre\r\nthick over all the cells, which disappear entirely under it. The nest\r\nis now a rude dome, about as big as half an orange; one would take it\r\nfor a clod of mud, half crushed by being flung against a stone where it\r\nhad dried. Nothing outside betrays its contents—no suggestion of\r\ncells—none of labour. To the ordinary eye it is only a chance splash of\r\nmud.\r\n\r\nThis general cover dries as rapidly as do our hydraulic cements, and\r\nthe nest is almost as hard as a stone. A knife with a strong blade is\r\nneeded to cut it. In its final shape the nest recalls in no degree the\r\noriginal work; one would suppose the elegant turrets adorned with\r\npebble work, and the final dome, looking like a bit of mud, to be the\r\nwork of two different species. But scratch away the cover of cement and\r\nwe recognise the cells and their layers of tiny pebbles. Instead of\r\nbuilding on a boulder yet unoccupied, Chalicodoma muraria likes to\r\nutilise old nests which have lasted through the year without notable\r\ninjury. The mortared dome has remained much as it was at the beginning,\r\nso solid was the masonry; only it is pierced by a number of round holes\r\ncorresponding to the chambers inhabited by the larvæ of the past\r\ngeneration. Such dwellings, only needing a little repair to put them in\r\ngood condition, economise much time and toil; so Mason Bees seek them,\r\nand only undertake new constructions when old nests fail them.\r\n\r\nFrom the same dome come forth brothers and sisters—reddish males and\r\nblack females—all descendants of the same bee. The males lead a\r\ncareless life, avoiding all labour, and only returning to their clay\r\ndwellings for a brief courtship of their ladies; and they care nothing\r\nfor the deserted dwelling. What they want is nectar from flower-cups,\r\nnot mortar between their mandibles. But there are the young mothers,\r\nwho have sole charge of the future of the family—to which of them will\r\nfall the inheritance of the old nest? As sisters they have an equal\r\nright to it—so would human justice decide, now that it has made the\r\nenormous progress of freeing itself from the old savage right of\r\nprimogeniture; but Mason Bees have not got beyond the primitive basis\r\nof property—the right of the first comer.\r\n\r\nSo when the time to lay has come, a bee takes the first free nest which\r\nsuits her and establishes herself there, and woe to any sister or\r\nneighbour who thenceforward disputes possession of it. A hot reception\r\nand fierce pursuit would soon put the new-comer to flight; only one\r\ncell is wanted at the moment out of all which gape like little wells\r\naround the dome, but the bee calculates that by and by the rest will be\r\nuseful, and she keeps a jealous watch on them all and drives away every\r\nvisitor. I cannot remember having seen two Mason Bees working on the\r\nsame pebble.\r\n\r\nThe work is now very simple. The bee examines the inside of the old\r\ncell to see where repairs are needed, tears down the rags of cocoon\r\nhanging on the walls, carries out the bits of earth fallen from the\r\nvault pierced by the inhabitant in order to get out, mortars any places\r\nout of repair, mends the orifice a little, and that is all. Then comes\r\nstorage, laying an egg, and stopping up the cell. When these are\r\nsuccessively completed, the general cover, the mortar dome, is repaired\r\nif necessary, and all is finished.\r\n\r\nChalicodoma sicula prefers a sociable life to a solitary one, and\r\nhundreds—nay, several thousands—will establish themselves on the under\r\nsurface of the tiles on a hovel, or the edge of a roof. It is not a\r\nreal society with common interests, dear to all, but merely a gathering\r\nwhere each works for herself and is not concerned for the rest—a throng\r\nrecalling the swarm of a hive only by their number and industry. They\r\nuse the same mortar as Chalicodoma muraria, equally resistant and\r\nwaterproof, but finer and without pebbles. First the old nests are\r\nutilised. Every free cell is repaired, stored, and shut up. But the old\r\nones are far from sufficing to the population, which increases rapidly\r\nyear by year, and on the surface of the nest, where the cells are\r\nhidden below the old general mortar covering, new ones are built as\r\nrequired. They are placed more or less horizontally, one beside\r\nanother, with no kind of order. Every constructor builds as the fancy\r\ntakes her, where and as she wills; only she must not interfere with her\r\nneighbour’s work, or rough treatment will soon call her to order. The\r\ncells accumulate in chance fashion in this workyard, where there is no\r\ngeneral plan whatever. Their form is that of a thimble divided down the\r\naxis, and their enclosure is completed either by adjacent cells, or the\r\nsurface of the old nest. Outside they are rough, and look like layers\r\nof knotted cords corresponding to the layers of mortar. Inside the\r\nwalls are level but not smooth; a cocoon will replace the absent\r\npolish.\r\n\r\nAs soon as a cell is built it is stored and walled up, as we have seen\r\nwith Chalicodoma muraria. This work goes on through the whole of May.\r\nAt length all the eggs are laid, and the bees, without any distinction\r\nas to what does or does not belong to them, all set to work on a common\r\nshelter of the colony—a thick bed of mortar, filling up spaces and\r\ncovering all the cells. In the end the nests look like a large mass of\r\ndry mud—very irregular, arched, thickest in the middle, the primitive\r\nkernel of the establishment, thinnest at the edges, where there are\r\nfewest cells, and very variable in extent, according to the number of\r\nworkers, and consequently to the time when the nest was begun. Some are\r\nnot much larger than one’s hand, while others will occupy the greater\r\npart of the edge of a roof, and be measured by square yards.\r\n\r\nIf Chalicodoma sicula works alone, as she often does, on the shutter of\r\nan unused window or on a stone or a branch, she behaves in just the\r\nsame way. For instance, if the nest is on a bough, she begins by\r\nsolidly fixing the basis of her cell on the slender twig. Then the\r\nbuilding rises into a little vertical tower. This cell being stored and\r\nceiled, another follows, supported both by the bough and the first\r\ncell, until six to ten cells are grouped one beside the other, and\r\nfinally a general cover of mortar encloses them all together with the\r\nbough, which gives them a firm foundation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilt on small pebbles which one can carry whither one will, remove, or\r\ninterchange, without disturbing either the work of the constructor or\r\nthe quiet of the inhabitants of the cells, the nests of Chalicodoma\r\nmuraria lend themselves readily to experiment—the only method capable\r\nof throwing a little light on the nature of instinct. Profitably to\r\nstudy the physical faculties of the animal it is not enough to know how\r\nto turn to account such circumstances as a happy chance may offer to\r\nthe observer: one must be capable of originating others, and vary them\r\nas much as possible and submit them to mutual control; in short, to\r\ngive science a solid basis of fact one must experiment. Then some day\r\nwill vanish before the evidence of exact documents the fantastic\r\nlegends which cumber our books, such as the Scarabæus inviting his\r\ncomrades to help in dragging his ball out of a rut, or a Sphex cutting\r\nup a fly to carry it in spite of the wind, and much more which is\r\nmisused by those who desire to see in the animal world that which is\r\nnot there. Thus, too, will materials be prepared which, used sooner or\r\nlater by a learned hand, will cast premature and baseless theories back\r\ninto oblivion.\r\n\r\nRéaumur generally confines himself to stating facts as they offered\r\nthemselves to him in the normal course of things, and does not attempt\r\nto penetrate further into the powers of the insect by means of\r\nconditions brought about artificially. In his day there was everything\r\nto do, and the harvest was so great that the illustrious reaper hurried\r\non to what was most urgent,—the gathering of it in, leading his\r\nsuccessors to examine grain and ear in detail. Nevertheless, he\r\nmentions an experiment made on Chalicodoma muraria by his friend Du\r\nHamel. The nest was placed in a glass funnel, the mouth of which was\r\nclosed by a piece of gauze. Three males were hatched, which, though\r\nthey had penetrated mortar hard as a stone, either did not attempt to\r\npierce the thin gauze, or thought it beyond their power to do so. All\r\nthree died under the glass. Insects generally only know how to execute\r\nthat which they need to do in the common order of nature, adds Réaumur.\r\n\r\nFor two reasons the experiment does not satisfy me. First of all, to\r\ngive gauze to be pierced by insects with tools made to pierce lumps as\r\nhard as tufa does not seem a happy idea; you cannot expect a navvy’s\r\npickaxe to do the same work as the scissors of a seamstress. Secondly,\r\nthe transparent glass prison seems ill chosen. As soon as it had opened\r\na way through the thickness of its earthen dome, the insect found\r\nitself in daylight, and to it daylight means final deliverance and\r\nfreedom. It strikes against an invisible obstacle—the glass, and glass\r\ndoes not suggest an obstacle to it. Beyond, it sees a free space bathed\r\nin sunshine. It exhausts itself in efforts to fly there, unable to\r\ncomprehend the uselessness of struggling against this strange,\r\ninvisible barrier, and perishes, obstinate and exhausted, without a\r\nglance at the gauze which closes the conical tube. The experiment must\r\nbe repeated under better conditions.\r\n\r\nThe obstacle I selected was common gray paper—opaque enough to keep the\r\ninsect in the dark—thin enough not to offer serious resistance to the\r\nprisoner’s efforts. As there is a vast difference by way of obstacle\r\nbetween a paper partition and a vault of unbaked clay, let us see first\r\nif Chalicodoma muraria knows how, or rather if it is able, to pierce\r\nsuch a barrier. The two mandibles—pickaxes adapted to pierce hard\r\nmortar—are they also scissors capable of cutting thin material? That is\r\nthe point to be ascertained.\r\n\r\nIn February, when the insect is already in the perfect state, I\r\nwithdrew a certain number of cocoons uninjured from their cells, and\r\nplaced each separately in a piece of reed, closed at one end naturally,\r\nopen at the other. The pieces of reed represented the nest-cells. The\r\ncocoons were introduced so that the head of the insect should turn to\r\nthe opening. Finally, my artificial cells were closed in various ways.\r\nSome had a stopper of kneaded earth, which, when dry, answered in\r\nthickness and consistency to the mortar of the nest; others were shut\r\nby a cylinder of Sorghum vulgare at least a centimetre thick, and\r\nothers with a stopper of gray paper, solidly fixed by its edges. All\r\nthese bits of cane were arranged side by side, vertically, in a box,\r\nwith the artificial roof at the top, so that the insects were in the\r\nexact position they had in a nest. To open them they must do as they\r\nwould had I not intervened—break through the wall overhead. I protected\r\nall with a large bell glass, and awaited the month of May when they\r\nwould emerge.\r\n\r\nThe result greatly surpassed my expectations. The earthen stopper made\r\nby me was pierced with a round hole, noways differing from that made by\r\nthe mason bee through its mortar dome. The vegetable barrier, so new to\r\nmy prisoner,—namely, the Sorghum cylinder,—was likewise opened by a\r\nhole, apparently made by a single effort, and the gray paper allowed\r\nthe insect to pass, not by bursting through, but once more by a neat\r\nround hole. So my bees were capable of work for which they were not\r\ncreated. To issue from their reed cells they did what probably none of\r\ntheir race ever did before; they perforated the Sorghum pith and made a\r\nhole in the paper just as they would have done with their natural clay\r\nceiling. When the moment came to free themselves, the nature of the\r\nobstacle was no hindrance so long as it was not too strong for them,\r\nand thenceforward the plea of incapacity could not be evoked where a\r\nmere paper barrier was in question.\r\n\r\nAt the same time as the reed cells, two intact nests on their pebbles\r\nwere placed under the glass bell. On one I pressed closely a sheet of\r\ngray paper over the mortar dome, so that to come forth the insect must\r\nfirst pierce the dome and then the paper, no space being left between\r\nthem; while a little cone of gray paper was gummed on the stone round\r\nthe other nest, so that, as in the first case, there was a double\r\nbarrier, an earthen and a paper one, with, however, this\r\ndifference—that the two barriers were not close together, there being a\r\nspace between them of about a centimetre at the base, and increasing as\r\nthe cone rises. The results of these two experiments were quite unlike.\r\nThe Hymenoptera from the nest where paper had been applied to the dome\r\ncame forth by piercing the double barrier, the outer one being pierced\r\nby a clean round hole, as in the reed cells closed in the same way. For\r\nthe second time it is shown that if the bee is stopped by a paper\r\nbarrier, the cause is not incapacity to deal with such an obstacle. On\r\nthe other hand, after they had pierced their earthen vault, the\r\ndwellers in the second nest who found the sheet of paper a little way\r\noff, made no attempt to overcome the obstacle over which they would so\r\neasily have triumphed had it been attached to the nest. They died under\r\nthe cover without an effort for freedom. So had perished Réaumur’s bees\r\nunder his glass tube when there was but a bit of gauze between them and\r\nfreedom. This fact appears to me rich in consequences. What! Here are\r\nstrong insects which find penetrating tufa mere play, and a stopper of\r\nthin wood or a sheet of paper quite easy to pierce, new as these are to\r\nthem, and yet these vigorous insects let themselves stupidly perish\r\nimprisoned in a cone of paper which they might have torn to bits with\r\none bite of their mandibles. They might—but they never dreamed of doing\r\nso. The motive of their dull inertness can be only this—the insect is\r\nexcellently endowed with tools and instinctive faculties, in order to\r\naccomplish the final act of its metamorphosis, i.e. issuing from the\r\ncocoon or cell. Its mandibles furnish it with scissors, file, pick, and\r\nlever to cut, gnaw, and pull down not only its cocoon and wall of\r\nmortar, but any other barrier not too tenacious which may be\r\nsubstituted for the natural wall of its nest. Moreover,—and this is a\r\nchief condition, without which its outfit would be useless,—there is, I\r\nwill not say the will to use these tools, but an inward stimulus\r\ninviting it to employ them. The hour to come forth having arrived, this\r\nstimulus awakens, and the insect sets to work to bore a passage.\r\n\r\nIn that case it matters little whether the material to be pierced is\r\nnatural mortar, Sorghum pith, or paper. The imprisoning cover will not\r\nresist long. It even matters little if the obstacle be thickened and a\r\npaper barrier be added to the earthen one. Both count as one if there\r\nbe no interval between them, and the insect passes through them because\r\nthis coming forth seems to it a single action. With the paper cone,\r\nwhose wall is at a short distance, the conditions are changed, although\r\nthe total thickness of barrier is really the same. The insect has done\r\nall that it was destined to do in order to free itself. To move freely\r\non the mortar dome means to it that deliverance is achieved. It has\r\nbored its way out; the work is accomplished. But round the nest another\r\nbarrier presents itself—the paper wall. To pierce through, the action\r\nalready accomplished must be repeated—that action which the insect has\r\nto perform but once in its life. It must double that which naturally is\r\nbut single; and it cannot, simply because it has not the will to do it.\r\nIt perishes for lack of the smallest ray of intelligence. Yet in this\r\nsingular intellect it is the fashion nowadays to see a rudiment of\r\nhuman reason! The fashion will pass and the facts remain, bringing us\r\nback to the good old ideas of the soul and its immortal destinies.\r\n\r\nRéaumur relates, too, how his friend Du Hamel, having seized a mason\r\nbee with his pincers when it had entered half-way into its cell, head\r\nfirst, to fill it with bee-bread, carried it into a room at a\r\nconsiderable distance from the spot where he caught it. The bee escaped\r\nand flew through the window. Du Hamel immediately returned to the nest.\r\nThe mason bee reached it almost at the same time, and resumed work. It\r\nonly seemed a little wilder, says the narrator.\r\n\r\nWhy were you not with me, venerated master, on the banks of the Aygues,\r\nwith their stretches of pebbles, dry for three parts of the year, and\r\nan enormous torrent when it rains? I would have shown you something far\r\nbetter than the fugitive escaped from your pincers. You should have\r\nseen, and shared my surprise thereat, not the short flight of a mason\r\nbee, which, carried into a room near at hand, escapes and returns\r\nstraight home in a neighbourhood familiar to her, but long journeys by\r\nunknown ways. You would have seen the bee, carried away by me to a long\r\ndistance, return with a geographical precision which the swallow would\r\nnot disown, or the martin, or the carrier-pigeon, and you would have\r\nasked yourself, as I did, what inexplicable knowledge of the map of the\r\ncountry guides this mother in seeking her nest. Let us come to the\r\nfacts. We must repeat on the mason bee my earlier experiments with the\r\nCerceris—namely, carrying the insect in darkness far from the nest,\r\nmarking and setting it free. In case any one should wish to repeat the\r\nexperiment, I will explain my method of operation, which may make it\r\neasier for a beginner. The insect destined for a long journey must of\r\ncourse be captured with certain precautions. No nippers, no pincers\r\nwhich might maim a wing, strain it, and endanger power of flight. While\r\nthe bee is absorbed in work within her cell, I cover the latter with a\r\nlittle glass tube. As she flies out she goes into this, and thus,\r\nwithout touching her, I can transfer her to a twist of paper and close\r\nit quickly. A botanical tin serves as a means of transporting the\r\ncaptives, each in its paper prison.\r\n\r\nIt is on the spots chosen as starting-places that the most delicate\r\noperation takes place—namely, marking each captive before freeing her.\r\nI use chalk powdered fine and moistened with a strong solution of gum\r\narabic. Dropped somewhere on the insect with a straw, it leaves a white\r\nmark, which dries quickly and adheres to the bee’s fleece. If a mason\r\nbee has to be marked, so as to distinguish her from another in an\r\nexperiment of short duration, such as I shall presently describe, I\r\nonly touch the tip of the abdomen with a straw charged with colour\r\nwhile the insect is half inside the cell, head down-wards. The bee does\r\nnot notice the slight touch and works on undisturbed; but the mark is\r\nnot very durable, nor at a spot favourable for its preservation, since\r\nthe bee frequently brushes her body to detach pollen, and sooner or\r\nlater effaces it. It is therefore in the very middle of the\r\nthorax—between the wings—that I drop the gummed chalk.\r\n\r\nIn such work it is hardly possible to wear gloves. The fingers require\r\nall their dexterity to seize the mason bee with sufficient delicacy,\r\nand to master her struggles without rough pressure. It is evident that\r\nif nothing else be gained, one is sure of stings; with a little address\r\nthey can generally be avoided, but not always; one must take them with\r\nresignation. Besides, a mason bee’s sting is by no means so painful as\r\nthat of a hive bee. The white spot dropped on the thorax—off goes the\r\nmason bee, and the mark dries as she goes.\r\n\r\nThe first time I tried the experiment I took two mason bees busy at\r\ntheir nests on the boulders covering the alluvial lands along the\r\nAygues, not far from Serignan, and carried them to my home at Orange,\r\nwhere I freed them after marking each. According to the Ordnance map\r\nthe distance between the two places is about four kilometres in a right\r\nline. The captives were freed in the evening at an hour when bees begin\r\nto leave off work, so it was likely that my two would spend the night\r\nsomewhere near.\r\n\r\nThe next morning I returned to the nests. It was still too cold, and\r\nwork was suspended. When the dew was dried the masons set to work. I\r\nsaw a bee, but without the white spot, taking pollen to one of the two\r\nnests whence had come the travellers whom I expected. A stranger,\r\nhaving found the cell unoccupied, and having expatriated the owner, had\r\nestablished herself there, unaware that it was the property of another.\r\nPerhaps she had been storing it since the previous evening. Towards ten\r\no’clock, at the hottest time, suddenly the proprietor arrived. Her\r\nrights as first occupier were inscribed as far as I was concerned in\r\nirrefutable characters in white chalk on her thorax. Here was one of my\r\ntravellers come back.\r\n\r\nOver waves of corn, over fields of red sainfoin, she had accomplished\r\nthe four kilometres, and returned to her nest after collecting booty on\r\nthe way, for she came,—worthy creature that she was!—all yellow\r\nunderneath with pollen. To return from the verge of the horizon was a\r\nmarvel, but to do so with a well-furnished pollen brush was really\r\nsublime economy! A journey, even if compulsory, is always for a bee an\r\nopportunity of collecting food. She found the stranger in her nest.\r\n“What’s all this? You just wait!” and fell furiously on the other, who\r\nperhaps had thought no wrong. Then there were hot pursuits through the\r\nair. From time to time the two hovered almost motionless, facing one\r\nanother with a couple of inches between them, doubtless measuring each\r\nother with their eyes, and humming abuse at one another. Sometimes one,\r\nsometimes the other alighted on the nest in question. I expected to see\r\na wrestle, and stings used; but I was mistaken. The duties of maternity\r\nspoke too imperiously to allow them to risk life, and wipe out the\r\ninjury in a mortal duel. All was limited to hostile demonstrations and\r\na few tussles leading to nothing.\r\n\r\nHowever, the proprietor seemed to draw redoubled courage and strength\r\nfrom consciousness of her rights. She encamped permanently on the nest\r\nand received the other bee each time that she ventured to approach with\r\nan irritated quiver of the wings in token of just indignation. The\r\nstranger finally withdrew discouraged, and instantly the mason resumed\r\nwork as actively as if she had not undergone the chances and changes of\r\na long journey.\r\n\r\nYet another word as to rights of property. While a mason bee is absent\r\nit is not unusual for some homeless vagabond to visit the nest, take a\r\nliking to it, and set to work, sometimes at the same cell, sometimes at\r\nthe next, if there are several free, as often happens with old nests.\r\nWhen the first occupant returns she does not fail to drive away the\r\nintruder, who always ends by getting the worst of it, so lively and\r\ninvincible is the real owner’s sense of property. Reversing the savage\r\nPrussian maxim, “Strength before right,” here right comes before\r\nstrength; otherwise the constant retreat of the intruder would be quite\r\ninexplicable, since the latter’s strength is in no way inferior to that\r\nof the real owner. If she has less audacity it must come from not\r\nfeeling braced by the sovereign strength of being right, which decides\r\namong equals, even in the brute creation.\r\n\r\nThe second of my two travellers did not appear, either on the day when\r\nthe first came, nor later. I decided to make another experiment—this\r\ntime with five subjects. Place of starting and arrival, distance and\r\nhours, were the same. I found three at the nests on the following day;\r\ntwo were missing.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore quite clear that Chalicodoma muraria carried away four\r\nkilometres, and, set free where she certainly could never have been\r\nbefore, can return home. But why did one out of two, and two out of\r\nfive, fail to do so? What one could do, why not another? Are they not\r\nequally gifted with the faculty which guides them through the unknown?\r\nIs it not rather inequality in the power of flight? I recollected that\r\nmy Hymenoptera did not all fly off with the same energy; hardly were\r\nsome out of my fingers, launching themselves impetuously into the air,\r\nthan I lost sight of them, while others let themselves drop a few paces\r\noff after a short flight. It seems certain that these had suffered\r\nduring the journey—perhaps from the concentrated heat in the furnace of\r\nmy box, or I may have harmed the jointure of the wings while marking\r\nthem—an operation difficult to perform when one has to avoid being\r\nstung. These are maimed, weak creatures—unable to go on with all sail\r\nspread, as they ought, for this journey. The experiment must be tried\r\nagain, only counting those bees which instantly leave my fingers with a\r\nswift, strong flight. We shall omit those which hesitate or linger\r\nclose by on some bush. Moreover, I will do my best to compute the time\r\nemployed in returning to the nest.\r\n\r\nSuch an experiment requires a considerable number of subjects, as the\r\nweak and maimed, who may be many, must be rejected. Chalicodoma muraria\r\ncannot furnish the quantity needed; it is not common enough, and I am\r\nanxious not to disturb the small people by the Aigues whom I want for\r\nother observations later. Fortunately I have near my house, under the\r\nprojecting edge of the roof of a shed, a magnificent colony of\r\nChalicodoma sicula in full activity. I can draw at pleasure on the\r\npopulous city. The insect is small—less than half the size of C.\r\nmuraria; no matter—all the more merit if it can traverse the four\r\nkilometres which I have in reserve for it, and find its nest. I took\r\nforty, isolating them as usual in paper cones.\r\n\r\nA ladder was placed against the wall in order to reach the nest; it was\r\nto be used by my daughter Aglaë, to allow her to mark the exact instant\r\nwhen the first one returned. I set the clock on the mantelpiece and my\r\nwatch together, that I might compare the moment of departure and\r\narrival. Then I carried off my forty captives to the spot where\r\nChalicodoma muraria works beside the Aygues. The expedition had a\r\ndouble scope—to observe Réaumur’s mason bee and set the Sicilian one\r\nfree. The latter would have to fly back four kilometres.\r\n\r\nAt length my prisoners were released—all marked with a large white dot\r\nin the middle of the thorax. It is not for nothing that one\r\nsuccessively handles forty wrathful Hymenoptera which forthwith\r\nunsheath and make play with their poisoned stings. Before the mark\r\ncould be made, too often the stab was given, and my burning fingers\r\nmoved in self-defence sometimes against my will; I handled them with\r\nmore consideration for myself than for the insect, and sometimes\r\nsqueezed my bees too hard. To experiment in order to lift a small\r\ncorner of the veil that covers a truth is a beautiful and noble thing,\r\nwhich can enable one to brave many perils, yet surely one may show a\r\nlittle impatience if in a brief space of time one’s finger tips get\r\nstung forty times. If any one should reproach me for my clumsy\r\nhandling, I would suggest that he make the experiment, and then judge\r\nhow far the situation was pleasant.\r\n\r\nIn short, either from the fatigue of the journey, or because I pressed\r\ntoo hard and injured some articulations, out of my forty Hymenoptera\r\nonly twenty flew off strongly and unhesitatingly; the rest strayed over\r\nthe herbage near at hand, unable to keep their balance, or remained on\r\nthe willows where I had put them, refusing to fly even when excited by\r\na straw. These faint-hearted ones, these maimed ones, these incapables\r\nhurt by my fingers, must be struck off the list. Twenty started with an\r\nunhesitating flight. That was amply sufficient.\r\n\r\nAt the moment of departure there was nothing special in the direction\r\ntaken—nothing of that straight line to the nest which the Cerceris took\r\nin a like case. As soon as they were free the Chalicodoma fled\r\nscared—one in this direction, one to a completely opposite point; but,\r\nas far as their fiery flight allowed, I think I saw a rapid return of\r\nthose bees which had flown in the wrong direction for their nests, and\r\nmost seemed to go to that side of the horizon. I leave this point with\r\nthe doubts unavoidable with regard to insects lost sight of at some\r\ntwenty metres distance. So far the experiment had been favoured by calm\r\nweather, but now things grew complicated. The heat was stifling, and\r\nthe sky grew stormy. Rather a strong wind rose, blowing from the\r\nsouth—the very direction which my bees should take to return home.\r\nCould they overcome this contrary current and cleave this aerial\r\ntorrent with their wings? If they try it they must keep close to the\r\nground, as I saw those Hymenoptera doing which continued to work, but\r\nit appeared out of the question to soar into the high regions where\r\nthey might obtain a clear acquaintance with the surrounding country. It\r\nwas therefore with great apprehension as to the success of my\r\nexperiment that I returned to Orange after again trying to learn some\r\nsecret from the bees on the Aygues pebbles.\r\n\r\nHardly had I entered my house when I saw Aglaë, flushed with\r\nexcitement. “Two,” she cried—“two came at twenty minutes to three, all\r\nladen with pollen!” A friend chanced to have come in—a grave legal\r\npersonage, who, hearing what was on hand, forgot the Code and stamped\r\npaper, and insisted on also watching for the arrival of my homing\r\npigeons. The result interested him more than did the lawsuit about the\r\npartition wall. In a Senegalian sun and furnace heat reflected from the\r\nwall, every five minutes did he mount the ladder bareheaded, with no\r\nother protection against sunstroke than his thick, gray locks. Instead\r\nof the single watcher whom I had posted I found two good pairs of eyes\r\nwatching the bees’ return. I had freed them about two o’clock, and the\r\nfirst two returned to the nest at twenty minutes to three, so that\r\nthree-quarters of an hour had sufficed for travelling four\r\nkilometres,—a very striking result, especially if we remember that the\r\nbees worked on the road, as was proved by the pollen on their bodies,\r\nand besides they must have been hindered by having the wind against\r\nthem. Two more came back under my eyes, and they had signs of having\r\nworked on the way by their load of pollen. As it was growing late,\r\nobservations could not be continued. When the sun goes down the mason\r\nbees leave the nest and take refuge I know not where—here and\r\nthere—perhaps under roof tiles and in little shelters in walls. I could\r\nnot count on the arrival of the others until work was resumed in full\r\nsunshine.\r\n\r\nThe next day, when sunshine recalled the scattered workers, I again\r\ncounted the bees with white dots on their thorax. My success surpassed\r\nall my hopes; I counted fifteen—fifteen of the deported bees storing or\r\nbuilding as if nothing had happened! Then the storm, which had\r\nthreatened more and more, burst, and a succession of rainy days stopped\r\nall further observations.\r\n\r\nSuch as it was, the experiment sufficed. Out of twenty bees which\r\nseemed fit for the journey when released, fifteen at least had come\r\nback—two in the first hour, and three in the course of the evening, and\r\nthe rest next morning. They had come back in spite of having the wind\r\nagainst them, and—a yet greater difficulty—in spite of their\r\nunfamiliarity with the place whither I had transported them. There\r\ncould be no question that it was for the first time that they saw the\r\nosier beds of the Aygues which I had chosen as the starting-place.\r\nNever on their own account had they gone so far afield, for they find\r\nall they want by way of building material and food close to my shed.\r\nThe road at the foot of the wall furnishes mortar; the meadows round my\r\nhouse offer nectar and pollen. Economical of time as they are, they\r\nwould not fly four kilometres to procure what abounds close to the\r\nnests. I see them daily taking material from the road, and making a\r\nharvest on the meadow flowers, especially on Salvia. According to all\r\nappearance they do not fly beyond a circle of a hundred metres. How\r\nthen did my exiles return? What guided them? Not memory, certainly, but\r\nsome special faculty, which we can only recognise by its astonishing\r\neffects without pretending to explain it, so far outside our own\r\npsychology is it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII\r\n\r\nAN EXCHANGE OF NESTS\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us continue our series of experiments on Chalicodoma muraria. From\r\nits position on a stone which one can move at will, its nest lends\r\nitself to very interesting trials. This is the first of them. I change\r\nthe place of a nest by carrying the pebble it is placed on some couple\r\nof yards away. Edifice and base forming but one, the move was made\r\nwithout at all disturbing the cells. I set the pebble in an open place\r\nwell in sight, as it was before. When the bee returned, she could not\r\nfail to see it.\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes the owner arrived and went straight where the nest\r\nused to be. She hovered gently just above the vacant spot, looked, and\r\nalighted just where the stone used to lie. There she walked about,\r\nsearching pertinaciously, then soared up and flew away. Her absence was\r\nshort; she came back speedily and resumed her search on foot or on the\r\nwing—always on the spot formerly occupied by the nest. A new fit of\r\nirritation expressed by a sudden flight through the osier bed, then as\r\nsudden a return and resumption of the vain search—always over the\r\nimpression left by the pebble which I had carried away. These sudden\r\nflights, prompt returns, and obstinate examinations of the empty place,\r\nwere repeated very many times before the mason bee could believe her\r\nnest was gone. She certainly must have seen it in its new position, for\r\nsometimes she flew only a few inches above it, but she did not care\r\nabout it. For her it only represented the nest of another bee.\r\n\r\nOften the experiment ends without so much as a visit to the stone\r\ncarried three or four yards away; the bee departs and does not return.\r\nIf the distance be less—say a yard—sooner or later she alights on the\r\npebble on which her nest is built. She will visit the cell which she\r\nwas making or storing a little while earlier, plunge in her head\r\nseveral times, examine the surface of the stone narrowly, and after\r\nmuch hesitation return to search over the original spot. The nest,\r\nwhich is no longer in its right place, is altogether abandoned, though\r\nit be but a yard away. Vainly does the bee alight on it; she cannot\r\nrecognise it as hers. I convinced myself of this by finding it several\r\ndays later in just the same state as when I moved it. The cell, half\r\nfilled with honey, was still open, allowing the ants to pillage it; the\r\ncell in process of construction was unfinished, without a single new\r\ncourse of mortar. Of course the bee may have returned, but she had not\r\nresumed her work. The displaced abode was abandoned for ever.\r\n\r\nI shall not deduce the strange paradox that a bee, capable of returning\r\nhome from a great distance, is yet incapable of finding it a yard off;\r\nthe interpretation of the facts does not involve this. The conclusion\r\nappears to be that she retains a tenacious impression of the spot\r\noccupied by the nest, returning there with an indefatigable obstinacy\r\nwhen the nest is gone. But of the nest itself she has a very vague\r\nnotion—does not recognise her own masonry kneaded with her own saliva,\r\nnor the honey paste she had collected. Vainly does she visit her work,\r\nthe cell; she abandons it, not acknowledging it any more, since the\r\nplace where lies the pebble is no longer the same.\r\n\r\nWe must own that insect memory is a strange one, so lucid in general\r\nknowledge of locality, so limited as to its home. I should be disposed\r\nto name it topographical instinct; the creature knows the localities,\r\nbut not the dear nest—the dwelling. The Bembex led us to a like\r\nconclusion. The nest being laid open, she cared nothing for the\r\nfamily—for the larva writhing distressfully in the sun unrecognised.\r\nWhat they do recognise, what they seek, and find with marvellous\r\nprecision, is the place where no longer exists anything of the entrance\r\ndoor—not even a threshold.\r\n\r\nIf any doubt remain as to the powerlessness of Chalicodoma muraria to\r\nknow her nest except by the place which the pebble occupies on the\r\nground, this may set it at rest. I substituted a nest of one mason bee\r\nfor that of another, as alike as might be, both in masonry and storage.\r\nOf course this exchange and those of which I shall speak later were\r\nmade during the absence of the owner. In the nest not hers, but placed\r\nwhere her own had been, she established herself without hesitation. If\r\nshe had been building, I offered her a cell in process of construction,\r\nand she worked on with the same care and zeal as if the work already\r\ndone had been her own. If she were bringing honey and pollen, I offered\r\na cell partly stored. Her journeys continued, with honey in her crop\r\nand pollen underneath her body to complete filling the store of another\r\nbee.\r\n\r\nThus the bee does not suspect the exchange, nor distinguish what is and\r\nis not hers. She thinks she is continuing to work at a cell really her\r\nown.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving her for a time in possession of the exchanged nest, I\r\nrestored her own. The fresh change passed unobserved; her labour was\r\ncontinued in the cell restored to her, at the point at which it had\r\narrived in the substituted one. Then I once more substituted the\r\nstrange nest, and still she persisted in her labour. Thus alternating\r\nnests at the same spot, I thoroughly convinced myself that the insect\r\ncannot perceive the difference between that which is her own and that\r\nwhich is not. Whether the cell be hers or not, she works with equal\r\nfervour, provided that the basis for the edifice—the stone—remains in\r\nits original position.\r\n\r\nOne may lend a livelier interest to the experiment by using two\r\nneighbouring nests—work at which is about equally advanced. I transpose\r\nthem, placing one where the other was; the distance is hardly a cubit.\r\nDespite this close neighbourhood, which allows the bees to see both\r\nnests at once and choose between them, the two bees on arriving each\r\nimmediately alighted on the substituted nest and went on working at it.\r\nWe may change the two nests at pleasure; we shall still see the two\r\nmason bees keep to the spot chosen by them and work in turn—now at\r\ntheir own cell, now at that of the other.\r\n\r\nIt may be thought that the confusion was caused by a close resemblance\r\nbetween the two nests, since, at first little expecting the results\r\nobtained, I began by choosing those as much alike as possible, lest the\r\nbees should be repelled. My caution presupposed a clear-sightedness the\r\ninsect did not possess. I now took two nests exceedingly unlike, except\r\nthat in each the bee found a cell advanced in its work to the same\r\npoint. The first was an old nest, with the dome pierced with eight\r\nholes, the orifices of cells of a preceding generation; one of these\r\nhad been restored, and the bee was storing it. The second was a new\r\nnest, with no dome, and composed of a single cell with little stones on\r\nthe outside. Here too the bee was storing her paste. Certainly no two\r\nnests could differ more: the one with its eight vacant rooms, and its\r\nample dome of clay, the other with a single cell—bare, and at most the\r\nsize of an acorn.\r\n\r\nWell, the two mason bees did not hesitate long before the two exchanged\r\nnests—hardly a yard apart. Each went to the site of its former abode.\r\nThe owner of the old nest found but a single cell. She rapidly\r\ninspected the stone, and without further ceremony first plunged her\r\nhead into the cell to disgorge honey, and then her hind-quarters to\r\ndrop pollen. And this was no action performed to rid herself as soon as\r\npossible of a trying burden, for she flew away and quickly returned\r\nwith fresh stores to be laid up. This bringing provisions to another’s\r\nlarder was repeated as often as I would allow. The other bee, finding,\r\ninstead of one cell a spacious building with eight chambers, was at\r\nfirst considerably embarrassed. Which of the eight was the right\r\none?—in which was her heap of bee bread? She plunged down into each\r\nroom, and at length found what she was seeking—a condition like that\r\nwhich she had left when she took her last journey, the beginning of a\r\nstore of food. From that moment she behaved like her neighbour, and\r\ncarried honey and pollen to a cell not made by her.\r\n\r\nLet us restore the nests to their natural places, exchanging them\r\nafresh. Each bee, after a little hesitation, sufficiently explained by\r\nthe very great difference between the two nests, will work alternately\r\nin her own cell and the strange one. At length the egg is laid and the\r\ncell closed, whichever the nest may be that she is occupied with at the\r\nmoment when the provisions are sufficient. Such facts show clearly why\r\nI hesitate to give the name of memory to the singular faculty that\r\nbrings back the insect so accurately to the site of her nest, yet does\r\nnot allow her to distinguish her work from that of another, however\r\ngreat may be the difference of appearance between them.\r\n\r\nNow let us experiment on Chalicodoma muraria from another psychological\r\npoint of view. Here is a mason bee at work on the first course of her\r\ncell; in exchange I give her one not only completed, but half full of\r\nhoney, which I stole from an owner who would speedily have laid an egg\r\nthere. What will the mason do with this munificent gift which spares\r\nher the labour of building and storage? Leave her mortar, of course,\r\nlay an egg, and close all up. Not at all! the animal finds our logic\r\nillogical. The insect obeys an inevitable, unconscious impulse. It has\r\nno choice as to what it shall do,—no discernment as to what is and is\r\nnot desirable,—but glides, as it were, down an irresistible slope\r\nprepared for it beforehand to bring it to a determined end. The facts\r\nstill to be stated affirm this strongly.\r\n\r\nThe bee, which is building, and to which I offer a cell ready made and\r\nfull of honey, will not give up building for that; she is following her\r\ntrade as mason, and once on that tack, led on by unconscious impulse,\r\nshe must needs build, even if her labour be superfluous and contrary to\r\nher interests. The cell I give her is certainly quite complete in the\r\nopinion of its own constructor, since the bee from whom I subtracted it\r\nwas finishing the store of honey. To touch it up, and, above all, to\r\nadd to it is useless and absurd. All the same the bee which is building\r\nwill build. On the orifice of the honey store she lays another layer of\r\nmortar, then another and another, until the cell is actually a third\r\nbeyond its usual height. Now the task is done—not as well indeed as if\r\nthe bee had continued the cell whose foundations she was laying when\r\nthe nests were exchanged, but certainly in a way more than enough to\r\ndemonstrate the irresistible impulse which drove the builder on. Then\r\ncame the storing, likewise abridged, for otherwise the honey would\r\noverflow by the union of the stores of two bees. Thus the mason bee,\r\nwhich is beginning to build, and to which one gives a cell completed\r\nand filled with honey, alters nothing in the order of her work. First\r\nshe builds and then she stores; only she shortens her labours—instinct\r\nwarning her that the height of the cell and quantity of honey are\r\nbeginning to assume proportions too great.\r\n\r\nThe reverse of this is not less conclusive. To a mason bee which was\r\nlaying up food I would give a cell only just sketched out and unable to\r\nreceive the honey paste. This cell, still damp from the constructor’s\r\nsaliva, might or might not be accompanied by other cells, recently\r\nclosed and containing an egg and honey. The bee, whose half-filled cell\r\nis thus replaced, seems greatly puzzled on arriving with her load at\r\nthis shallow hollow offering no place for the honey. She will examine\r\nit, measure it with her eye, try it with her antennæ, and recognise its\r\ninsufficient depth. For a time she hesitates, departs, returns, flies\r\noff again, and comes back in haste to dispose of her load. Her\r\nembarrassment is visible; I could not help saying inwardly: “Take some\r\nmortar—take some mortar, and finish your storehouse. It will only\r\nrequire a few moments to make it deep enough.” The bee was of a\r\ndifferent opinion. She was laying in food, and food she must lay up,\r\nhappen what might. She could not decide to lay aside the pollen brush\r\nfor the mason’s trowel, and nothing could induce her to delay the\r\nharvest which occupied her in order to take up that work of building\r\nfor which it is not the due moment. Rather would she seek another cell,\r\nin the desired condition, and will penetrate there to store the honey,\r\neven if received with fury by the owner. In fact, this happened. I\r\nwished her success, knowing myself to be the cause of this desperate\r\nact. My curiosity had turned an honest worker into a thief.\r\n\r\nMatters may take a yet more serious turn, so obstinate and imperious is\r\nthe desire to harvest the store securely. The unfinished cell that the\r\nbee refuses to accept instead of her own complete one, with its honey,\r\nis sometimes, as I have said, among several containing paste and egg,\r\nand newly closed. In this case I have seen, though not always, the\r\nfollowing sight. Having ascertained unmistakably that the unfinished\r\ncell will not do, the bee begins to gnaw the cover of a neighbouring\r\none. With her saliva she softens a spot in the mortar, and patiently\r\ndigs away atom by atom in the hard covering. A long half hour passes\r\nbefore the tiny dimple excavated is big enough to receive a pin’s head.\r\nI waited. Then I got out of patience, and, feeling sure that she wanted\r\nto open the storehouse, I decided to help her and shorten the labour.\r\nWith the point of my knife I knocked off the top; but the crown of the\r\ncell came off too, and its edge was a good deal broken. In my\r\nclumsiness I had made a graceful vase into a wretched, shattered pot. I\r\nwas right; the bee wanted to break open the door, and without troubling\r\nherself as to the fragmentary state of the orifice, she immediately\r\nestablished herself in the cell opened to her. Many times did she bring\r\nhoney and pollen, though the store was already complete. Finally, in\r\nthis cell containing an egg not hers she laid her own egg, and then\r\nclosed, as best she could, the shattered mouth. Thus this bee, who was\r\nengaged in bringing food, neither could nor would be baffled by the\r\nimpossibility brought about by me of continuing her work unless she\r\ncompleted the cell which replaced hers. What she was doing she\r\npersisted in doing in spite of obstacles. She accomplished her task\r\nthoroughly, but in the most absurd way,—by breaking into another bee’s\r\ncell, continuing to store in a cell already overflowing, placing an egg\r\nwhere the real owner had already laid one, and finally, closing an\r\norifice which needed serious repairs. Could one desire a better proof\r\nof the irresistible impulse obeyed by the insect?\r\n\r\nFinally, there are other rapid and consecutive actions so closely\r\nconnected that the execution of the second implies necessarily the\r\nrepetition of the first, even when this has become useless. I have\r\nalready said how Sphex flavipennis persists in going down into her\r\nburrow alone, having brought near it the cricket which I cruelly\r\nremoved immediately. Her repeated discomfitures did not make her give\r\nup the preliminary domiciliary visit, useless as it is when repeated\r\nten or twenty times. Chalicodoma muraria exhibits under another form a\r\nlike repetition of an act useless itself, but a necessary prelude to\r\nthe next one. Arrived with her booty, she goes through a double act of\r\nstorage. First she plunges head first into the cell to disgorge the\r\ncontents of her crop; then she comes out, returning at once backward to\r\nbrush off her load of pollen. At the moment when she is about to enter,\r\ntail first, I gently put her aside with a straw, thus hindering her\r\nsecond action. She begins all over again, going head first into the\r\ncell, although her crop is empty. Then comes the turn of going in\r\nbackward. I instantly put her aside again, and again she goes in head\r\nfirst. Once more I use my straw. And this goes on as long as the\r\nobserver pleases. Put aside just as she is about to introduce her\r\nhinder parts into the cell, she returns to the orifice and persists in\r\ndescending head first. Sometimes she goes quite down—sometimes only\r\nhalf-way, or perhaps there is a mere pretence at descending, and she\r\nonly stoops her head in the opening, but at any rate this quite useless\r\naction—for the honey is already disgorged—invariably precedes the\r\nentrance backward to deposit pollen. It is almost the movement of a\r\nmachine, not a wheel of which moves till the main one begins to turn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTIVE NOTES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following Hymenoptera appear new to me in the French fauna. I\r\nappend their description:—\r\n\r\n\r\n                Cerceris antoniæ, H. Fab.\r\n\r\nLength—16–18 millimetres. Black, closely and strongly punctured;\r\nclypeus raised like a nose, i.e. forming a convex projection, large at\r\nthe base, pointed at the end—like half a cone cut down its length;\r\ncrest between the antennæ projecting; a line above crest, cheeks, and a\r\nlarge dot behind each eye, yellow; hood—yellow with black point;\r\nmandibles, rusty yellow; tips, black. The 4th and 5th joints of\r\nantennæ, rusty yellow, the rest brown. Two dots on prothorax, wing\r\nscales and postscutellum, yellow; first segment of abdomen with two\r\ndot-like spots; four next on posterior edge having a yellow band\r\nsharply hollowed in triangle form, or even broken, and this the more as\r\nthe segment is a less distant one.\r\n\r\nUnder part of the body, black; feet entirely of rusty yellow colour;\r\nwings slightly bronzed at tip. Female. Male unknown to me.\r\n\r\nIn colouring this species approaches Cerceris labiata, from which,\r\nhowever, it differs remarkably in the form of the clypeus and the much\r\nlarger size of the insect. Observed round Avignon in July. I dedicate\r\nthis species to my daughter Antonia, whose help has often been valuable\r\nto me in my entomological researches.\r\n\r\n\r\n                Cerceris julii, H. Fab.\r\n\r\nLength—7–9 millimetres. Black, closely and strongly punctured; clypeus\r\nflat; face covered with a fine silvery pubescence; a narrow yellow band\r\non each side, on the inner edge of the eyes; mandibles—yellow with\r\nbrown tips; antennæ—black above, pale red below; lower face of their\r\nbasal joint, yellow. Two small distant points on the prothorax; scales\r\nof wings and postscutellum, yellow. A yellow band on third segment of\r\nthe abdomen, and another on the fifth; these two are deeply hollowed on\r\nthe anterior edge—the first in a semicircle, the second in a triangle.\r\n\r\nUnder part of the body all black; coxæ black; thighs of the hinder pair\r\nof legs quite black; those of the two anterior pairs, black at base,\r\nyellow at the ends; legs and tarsi, yellow; wings rather\r\nsmoke-coloured. Female.—Var. (1) Prothorax without yellow dots; (2) two\r\nsmall yellow dots on second segment of abdomen; (3) wider yellow band\r\non inner side of the eyes; (4) front of clypeus edged with yellow.\r\n\r\nMale unknown to me. This Cerceris, the smallest of my part of France,\r\nfeeds its larvæ on the smallest kinds of weevils (Bruchus granarius and\r\nApion gravidum). Observed round Carpentras, where it builds in\r\nSeptember in soft sandstone—locally called safre.\r\n\r\n\r\n                Bembex julii, H. Fab.\r\n\r\nLength—18–20 millimetres. Black, with bristling whitish hairs on head,\r\nthorax, and base of first segment of the abdomen; labrum lengthened,\r\nyellow; clypeus, with a sloping ridge, forming as it were an angle of\r\nthree sides—one face—that of the outer edge—is all yellow, while each\r\nof the two others is marked with a large rectangular black patch\r\nbordering on its neighbour, and thus forming a stripe; both marks, as\r\nwell as the cheeks, are covered with a fine silvery down; cheeks on\r\nline between the antennæ, yellow; posterior edge of eyes with a long\r\nyellow border; mandibles—yellow, with brown tips; two first joints of\r\nantennæ yellow beneath, black above, the rest black; prothorax—black;\r\nsides and dorsal division, yellow; mesothorax—black; the callous point,\r\nand a small one on each side above the base of the intermediate feet,\r\nyellow; metathorax—black, with two yellow dots behind, and a larger one\r\non each side above the base of the hind feet. The two first dots are\r\nsometimes wanting.\r\n\r\nAbdomen—bright black above and without hairs, except at the base of the\r\nfirst segment, which bristles with whitish ones. All the segments have\r\na wavy transverse band, wider on the sides than in the middle, and\r\napproaching the posterior edge in proportion as the segment is further\r\nback. On the fifth segment the yellow band reaches the posterior edge.\r\nAnal segment—yellow, black at the base, bristling all over the dorsal\r\nsurface with papillæ of a rusty red, which serve as base to the hairs.\r\nA row of like hair-bearing tubercules occupies also the posterior edge\r\nof the fifth segment. Below, the abdomen is a brilliant black, with a\r\ntriangular yellow mark on each side of the four intermediate segments.\r\n\r\nCoxæ—black; thighs yellow in front, black behind; legs and\r\ntarsi—yellow; wings transparent.\r\n\r\nMale.—The zig-zag mark on the clypeus is narrower, or even absent; face\r\nthen entirely yellow; abdominal bands very pale yellow, almost white.\r\nThe sixth segment has a band like the preceding ones, but shorter and\r\noften reduced to two dots. The second segment has underneath it a\r\nlongitudinal keel, raised and spine-shaped behind. The anal one has\r\nbelow it an angular, rather thick projection. Otherwise like the\r\nfemale.\r\n\r\nThis Hymenopteron much resembles Bembex rostrata in size, shape, and\r\narrangement of the black and yellow colouring, but differs markedly in\r\nthe following characteristics:—The clypeus makes a triangle of three\r\nsides, while in other Bembecids it is rounded and convex. Also at the\r\nbase is a large zig-zag band, formed by two rectangular marks joined\r\ntogether and softened by a silvery down, very brilliant under certain\r\nlights. The upper surface of the anal segment bristles with papillæ and\r\nreddish hairs—likewise the further edge of the fifth segment. The\r\nmandibles are only black at the tips, while in Bembex rostrata the base\r\nis also black. Their habits are equally unlike; B. rostrata especially\r\nhunts gadflies, while B. julii never catches large Diptera, but takes\r\nsmaller kinds of very varying size. It is frequent in the sandy land of\r\nthe Angles, round Avignon, and on the hill of Orange.\r\n\r\n\r\n                Ammophila julii, H. Fab.\r\n\r\nLength—from 16–22 millimetres. Stalk of abdomen composed of the first\r\nsegment and half the second; third cubital narrowed towards the radial;\r\nhead—black, with silvery down on the face; antennæ—black; thorax—black,\r\nwith transverse stripes on its three segments, darker on prothorax and\r\nmesothorax. Two marks on the sides and one behind either side of the\r\nmetathorax, covered with silvery down; abdomen bare, shining. First\r\nsegment—black; second—red in the part narrowing to the petiole and in\r\nthe widened part; third segment all red; the rest of a beautiful\r\nmetallic blue. Legs—black, with silvery down on the coxæ; wings\r\nslightly reddish. Builds in October, and lays up two smallish\r\ncaterpillars in each cell. Nearly related to A. holosericea, having the\r\nsame shape, but differing markedly in the colour of the legs, which are\r\nall black, by the much less downy head and thorax, and by the\r\ntransverse stripes on the three segments of the thorax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI wish these three Hymenoptera to bear the name of my son Jules, to\r\nwhom I dedicate them.\r\n\r\nDear child! snatched so early from thy passionate love of flowers and\r\ninsects! Thou wert my fellow-worker; nothing escaped thy clear-sighted\r\nglance; it was for thee that I was to write this book—for thee, to whom\r\nits recital gave such delight, and thou wert one day to have continued\r\nit. Alas! thou didst leave us for a better home, having heard but the\r\nfirst few lines of the book. But at least let thy name appear in\r\nit—borne by some of these industrious and beauteous Hymenoptera so dear\r\nto thee!\r\n\r\n                                                               J. H. F.\r\n\r\n    Orange, 3rd April 1879.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Souvenirs Entomologiques (Ch. Delagrave, 15 Rue Soufflot, Paris),\r\nof which there are now seven series, this volume being a translation of\r\nthe first.\r\n\r\n[2] The Scarabæus is also called Ateuchus.\r\n\r\n[3] G. pilularius is a scavenger beetle nearly related to the\r\nScarabæus. As its name suggests, it too rolls balls of dung. It is\r\nfound very generally, even in the north, whereas S. sacer scarcely\r\nleaves the shores of the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n[4] Fabre subsequently completed the whole life-history and published\r\nit in the fifth series of his Souvenirs (1897).\r\n\r\n[5] The beetles dug up belonged to the following species:—Buprestis\r\noctoguttata, B. bifasciata, B. pruni, B. tarda, B. biguttata, B.\r\nmicans, B. flavomaculata, B. chrysostigma, B. novem-maculata.\r\n\r\n[6] In a later essay, Fragments on Psychology, M. Fabre withdraws these\r\nstrictures on (Erasmus) Darwin, explaining that they are based on a\r\nmisquotation by Lacordaire, who writes “Sphex” where Darwin had said\r\n“wasp.”",
