II._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nMETEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY.\r\n\r\n_By HUGH ROBERT MILL, D.SC, LL.D., F.R.S.E., Formerly President\r\nRoyal Meteorological Society, and Director of the British Rainfall\r\nOrganization._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe nature of the meteorological observations made by a traveller or by\r\na resident in regions where there is no organised meteorological service\r\nwill necessarily depend on the object which he has in view, the time he\r\nis able to devote to meteorological work, his knowledge of meteorology as\r\na science, and his interest in it.\r\n\r\nOf the many ways in which a traveller may add to the knowledge of\r\natmospheric conditions, five may be specially mentioned:—\r\n\r\n    1. _A record of the weather, observed day by day with regard\r\n    both to non-instrumental observations and the readings of\r\n    instruments._ This may be taken as the minimum incumbent on all\r\n    travellers.\r\n\r\n    2. _Observations for forecasting the weather and obtaining\r\n    warning of storms._ This is sometimes of vital importance; it\r\n    is always valuable at the time, and occasionally the results\r\n    are worth recording. It may, however be looked upon as a\r\n    practical application of the systematic observations.\r\n\r\n    3. _Observations with a view to determining the character of\r\n    the local climate._ The traveller passing through a country can\r\n    do little in this way, as long continued uniform observations\r\n    in one place are necessary to fix the annual variations.\r\n    Still, the recording of such data as may be obtained is always\r\n    important in a little-known region, and the work of several\r\n    travellers at different seasons will allow some fair deductions\r\n    to be drawn. When a day is spent in camp, much importance\r\n    attaches to regular observations made every two hours, from\r\n    which the diurnal changes of climate may be ascertained.\r\n\r\n    4. _Special meteorological researches._ These usually demand\r\n    special instruments and skilled observers. Observations in the\r\n    upper air by kites or balloons in particular, must be an end in\r\n    themselves. Exact measures of radiation in deserts, of rainfall\r\n    in forests and on adjacent open ground, of temperature during\r\n    land and sea breezes, or of fogs, thunderstorms, tornadoes,\r\n    etc., in places subject to those visitations, are always of\r\n    value. As a rule, however, the traveller cannot devote much\r\n    time to these matters, unless the study of physical geography\r\n    is the object of his journey.\r\n\r\n    5. _The collection of existing meteorological records._ It\r\n    sometimes happens that at outlying stations meteorological\r\n    observations have been taken and recorded for a considerable\r\n    time. If they have not been already communicated to some\r\n    meteorological centre, the traveller should obtain a copy of\r\n    them, and also compare the instruments in use with his own.\r\n    He might in some cases aid in securing a knowledge of local\r\n    climate by inducing residents at outlying stations to start\r\n    regular observations.\r\n\r\nThe first two ways of advancing meteorology need alone be considered in\r\ndetail; but with regard to all, it must be clearly understood that the\r\nvalue of the work is greater the more carefully the observations are made\r\nand recorded, and the more remote and less known the region.\r\n\r\n1. A RECORD OF WEATHER.—The traveller who makes his journey for any\r\nother purpose than the study of physical geography would be wise to\r\nburden himself as little as possible with instruments, but to understand\r\nthoroughly and use faithfully the few he carries. In a rapid march many\r\ndifferent climates may be traversed in a few weeks, and the records of\r\nvariation of weather so obtained could not have much value; but when a\r\nhalt of a few days or of a week or two is made, systematic observations\r\nbecome valuable.\r\n\r\n\r\nNON-INSTRUMENTAL OBSERVATIONS.\r\n\r\nThe first place must be given to non-instrumental observations, which may\r\nbe made at any time on the march or in camp, and should always be noted\r\nat the time they are made in the rough note-book, and copied carefully\r\ninto the journal each evening. These observations in the rough note-book\r\nwill necessarily be mixed up with others on various subjects; but the\r\nmeteorological facts should have a place reserved for themselves in the\r\njournal, say at the end of each day’s work.\r\n\r\n_Wind._—Observations of the direction and force of the wind at several\r\nfixed hours in the day are advisable for comparison with instrumental\r\nreadings; but on the march every decided change should be recorded if\r\nthe nature of the country permits. In the depths of a forest, or in a\r\nnarrow valley, the wind, if felt at all by the traveller, gives scarcely\r\nany clue to the movement of the air over the open country, but in most\r\ncases the movements of low clouds, when any are in sight, may be taken\r\nas a fairly satisfactory test. The direction is to be observed by means\r\nof the compass, and it will be sufficient to estimate it by the eight\r\nprincipal points—North, North-east, East, South-east, South, South-west,\r\nWest, and North-west. Any sudden changes in direction so pronounced as\r\nto be noticeable should be recorded, for, taken in conjunction with the\r\nbarometer readings, if the journey is along a route of nearly constant\r\nlevel, they are valuable aids in predicting the weather. In some places\r\nthe direction of the wind undergoes a well-marked regular diurnal change\r\nin perfectly settled weather.\r\n\r\nWind is always named by the direction from which it blows. The force of\r\nthe wind is best estimated on the scale Calm, Light, Moderate, Fresh,\r\nStrong, and Gale. It is impossible, without long experience and the\r\ntuition of a trained observer, to assign relative numbers to these\r\nforces which should have any permanent value for comparison with the\r\nobservations of others. Travelling on foot in a strong wind is always\r\nuncomfortable, and in a gale very difficult. If it is impossible to\r\nmake way against the wind at all, or to pitch tents, the force may be\r\nput down as Hurricane after it has passed, the traveller bearing in\r\nmind that if he can write in his note-book at all, while unsheltered,\r\na hurricane is not blowing. If a lake or a river without appreciable\r\ncurrent is in sight, wind just sufficient to produce white crests on the\r\nwaves may be called fresh, and that sufficient to blow away spray from\r\nthe crests deserves to be termed strong. At sea, in a sailing-vessel,\r\nit is possible to acquire great skill in estimating wind-force; hence\r\nBeaufort’s scale, originally devised with reference to the amount of sail\r\na well-equipped frigate could carry, has come into extensive use, and it\r\nis as well to know it. By comparison with anemometers, the approximate\r\nvelocity in miles per hour corresponding to the numbers on the scale has\r\nbeen estimated:—\r\n\r\n  BEAUFORT’S SCALE OF WIND FORCE.[1]\r\n\r\n  -----+-----------------+------------------\r\n       |                 | Mean Velocity in\r\n   No. |      Name.      |  miles per hour.\r\n  -----+-----------------+------------------\r\n    0  | Calm            |         0\r\n    1  | Light air       |         1\r\n    2  | Light breeze    |         4\r\n    3  | Gentle breeze   |         9\r\n    4  | Moderate breeze |        14\r\n    5  | Fresh breeze    |        20\r\n    6  | Strong breeze   |        26\r\n    7  | Moderate gale   |        33\r\n    8  | Fresh gale      |        42\r\n    9  | Strong gale     |        51\r\n   10  | Whole gale      |        62\r\n   11  | Storm           |        75\r\n   12  | Hurricane       |        92\r\n  -----+-----------------+-----------------\r\n\r\nThe duration of strong wind should be noted, as well as the time of any\r\nmarked change of strength. The land and sea winds of tropical coasts show\r\na well-marked relation to the position of the sun and the hour of sunset,\r\nand in places where these winds blow the hours of calm and change should\r\nbe noted. On mountain slopes a similar diurnal effect may be noticed;\r\nthe wind usually blows uphill during the day and downhill at night,\r\nwhile in valleys it usually blows either with or against the direction of\r\nthe river. Local winds of peculiar character are sometimes met with in\r\nassociation with mountains such as the Föhn of the Alps, the Chinook wind\r\nof the Rocky Mountains, and the Helm wind of the Eden Valley in England\r\nand Adam’s Peak in Ceylon.\r\n\r\nWhirlwinds and tornadoes are rare phenomena, but if met with, it is worth\r\nwhile to take some trouble to put on record at least the hour of their\r\nappearance (local time), the direction in which the whirl moves onward,\r\nand the breadth of the path of destruction it leaves behind. When a storm\r\nof wind has passed over a wooded region and blown down many trees, the\r\ndirection in which most of the trunks lie is worth observing. The top of\r\nthe tree usually falls in the direction in which the wind was blowing,\r\nhence the root usually points to the direction of the wind. Waterspouts\r\nare closely allied to whirlwinds, and in any of those phenomena of\r\nrevolving columns of air it is of much theoretical importance to\r\ndetermine the direction of the whirl about the axis, _i.e._, whether the\r\nrotation is in the direction of the hands of a watch or the opposite.\r\nThe prevailing wind of a district may often be discovered by the slope\r\nof trees growing on open ground, or still better, by the difference in\r\nthe degree of wave erosion on small lakes. If the banks are of the same\r\nmaterial all round, the side against which the prevailing wind drives the\r\nwaves will always be the most worn away.\r\n\r\n_Cloud and Sunshine._—It would be impossible to keep a record of the\r\ncountless changes in the cloud-covering of an English sky, but in many\r\nparts of the world the absence or presence of cloud is a function of\r\nlatitude, altitude, and season, of great stability, and worthy of being\r\nattentively studied. The amount of cloud is usually estimated as the\r\nnumber of tenths of the sky covered; but it is a very difficult thing\r\nindeed to compare a tenth of the visible sky near the horizon with a\r\ntenth near the zenith. There is no difficulty, however, in observing when\r\nthe sky is completely overcast or quite free of cloud, and as a matter of\r\nconvenience the belt round the horizon to the height of thirty degrees\r\nmay be neglected, _i.e._, the lower third of the distance from the\r\nhorizon to the zenith. Very often it will be found that clouds form and\r\ndisappear at certain hours of the morning or evening, and it is useful to\r\nget exact information on the subject.\r\n\r\nOf more importance than the amount of cloud is its nature, elevation,\r\nand movement. Distinct species of cloud have been recognised for a long\r\ntime, and from more recent studies it would appear that they owe their\r\ndistinctive appearance to the altitude at which they float in the air.\r\nMeteorologists distinguish a number of classes and transitional forms of\r\ncloud; it is enough for the traveller to be able to recognise the most\r\ndefinite types, viz., Cirrus, Cumulus, Stratus, and Nimbus. _Cirrus_\r\nclouds are the small tufts or wisps of cloud which float very high in the\r\natmosphere, and to which the popular name of “mare’s tails” is applied.\r\nThe transitional form, _Cirro-Cumulus_, popularly known as “mackerel\r\nscales” or “mackerel sky,” is equally easy to identify. _Cumulus_ clouds\r\nare great woolly-looking heaps of cloud, the lower surface of which\r\nis often nearly horizontal, while above they well into an exuberant\r\nvariety of rounded forms. They represent the condensation of moisture\r\nin ascending columns of heated air. _Stratus_ clouds are low-lying\r\nsheets of condensed moisture, which, being usually seen at a low angle,\r\nappear like thin layers parallel to the horizon. The transitional type\r\n_Cirro-Stratus_ is usually seen in the form of great feather-like clouds\r\nstretching across nearly the whole sky. _Nimbus_ is a rather low-lying\r\ncloud from which rain is falling even if the rain is re-evaporated\r\nbefore reaching the ground. The lowest clouds of all, those resting\r\non the surface of the ground and enveloping the observer, are called\r\n_mist_ and _fog_. The two are distinguished by the fact that a mist wets\r\nobjects immersed in it, while a fog does not. All clouds, except Cirrus,\r\nare physically the same, consisting of minute globules of liquid water\r\nfalling through a portion of air saturated with moisture. The globules\r\nbeing small offer a relatively great surface to friction, and so fall\r\nvery slowly, and in the higher clouds they evaporate on the lower surface\r\nbefore they have time to agglomerate into raindrops. In the highest of\r\nall clouds, the cirrus type, the particles are spicules of ice and not\r\nglobules of water. It is a common error to suppose that black clouds\r\ndiffer from white clouds. All clouds are white when they reflect the\r\nlight of the sun, and all are black when they come between the eye and\r\nthe sun in sufficient thickness to cut off a considerable portion of its\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nThe sudden appearance of a particular kind of cloud is important as\r\na weather sign. It shows that changes are going on in the vertical\r\ncirculation of the atmosphere. Hence if cirrus or cumulus cloud should be\r\nobserved to be increasing the fact should be noted, and the direction in\r\nwhich the clouds are moving should be noted also.\r\n\r\nIn observing cloud-motion attention should be given only to the sky\r\noverhead; at any lower angle the parallax due to viewing the clouds\r\nobliquely deprives the observation of value. It is also necessary to\r\ndistinguish between the movement of the upper and of the lower clouds,\r\nas these are floating in very different parts of the atmosphere. It is\r\ncomparatively rarely that the motion, say of nimbus and cirrus, is in the\r\nsame direction. On a lofty mountain, strata of cloud which from below\r\nwere seen to be cumulus may be passed through as layers of mist, and on\r\nemerging from them their upper surface may be seen below one. In many\r\nmountains the cloud-belt is as sharply defined as the snow-line, and its\r\nvariations should be carefully observed.\r\n\r\nClouds should occasionally be photographed as a record. This should\r\nbe done especially when a type of cloud comes to be recognised as a\r\nusual one, for while exceptional forms may prove interesting, a record\r\nof the usual forms is certain to be valuable. In this connection a\r\nprotest may be made against the horrible custom of some amateur and of\r\nmany professional photographers of printing in clouds from some stock\r\nnegative in their pictures of scenery. The cloud is an essential part of\r\na picture, and it is better to leave an over-exposed sky of natural cloud\r\nthan to insert a beautiful representation of a cloud-form which may be\r\none never visible in the particular place or at the particular season.\r\n\r\n_Mist, Fog and Haze._—Mist or fog at low levels will of course be\r\nrecorded whenever observed, and its density and duration noted. A good\r\nway to define the density of thick fog is to measure the number of yards\r\nat which an object becomes indistinguishable, and the most convenient\r\nobject for the purpose is a person. Light mists lie over water or marshes\r\nat certain hours in particular seasons, and their behaviour should always\r\nbe observed. It often happens that the distant view from a height is\r\nobscured by a haze not due to moisture, and this appearance should be\r\nnoticed with a view to discovering its cause. The smoke from forest or\r\nprairie fires in Canada sometimes produces so thick a haze as to put a\r\nstop to surveying operations for weeks at a time. Haze is often due to\r\ndust blown from deserts, or ejected from volcanoes, and sometimes to\r\nswarms of insects.\r\n\r\n_Rain and Dew._—The journals of most travellers fail to give a clear\r\nidea of the prevalence of rain during their journeys, and it is much to\r\nbe desired that something more explicit than “a showery day” or “fairly\r\ndry” should be recorded. The hour of commencement and cessation of rain\r\nduring a march should be noted, and some indication given as to whether\r\nthe rain fell heavily or lightly. In this way any tendency to a diurnal\r\nperiodicity of rain would be detected, and some definite meaning would be\r\ngiven to the terms rainy season and dry season. If rain occurs during the\r\nnight it should also be recorded, and the amount of night rains should\r\nalways be measured by means of a rain gauge in the manner to be described\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nThe general condition of a country with regard to rain may often be\r\njudged from the appearance of vegetation or the marks of former levels\r\nof high-water in lakes or rivers. Thus on mountain slopes or the sides\r\nof a valley any difference in the luxuriance of vegetation according to\r\nexposure probably indicates the influence of rainfall as guided by the\r\nprevailing wind. So, too, the appearance of lines of drifted débris on\r\nthe banks some distance from the edge of a lake or river may be taken\r\nas indications of the height to which the waters sometimes rise; and\r\nconversely the appearance of rows of trees in the middle of a wide\r\nshallow lake may indicate the line of a river which has temporarily\r\nflooded the surrounding meadows. Such observations have an important\r\nbearing on climate.\r\n\r\nThe appearance and amount of dew are also to be recorded. The most\r\nimportant points to notice are the hour in the evening when the deposit\r\ncommences, and the hour in the morning when the dew disappears. It should\r\nbe noted also whether the deposit of dew is in the form of small globules\r\nstanding apart on exposed surfaces, or if it is heavy enough to run\r\ntogether into drops and drip from vegetation to the ground.\r\n\r\n_Thunderstorms and Hail._—The occurrence of thunderstorms should of\r\ncourse be noted, and here the hour of occurrence is of very great\r\nimportance, for thunderstorms frequently show a marked diurnal period.\r\nThe appearance of lightning without thunder should be recorded when it\r\nis observed, but this will naturally be almost always after sunset.\r\nHailstorms usually accompany thunderstorms, and sometimes take the place\r\nof them. The occurrence of hail is most frequent in summer, and records\r\nof the size of hailstones are important. If possible they should, when\r\nvery large, be photographed along with some object of known size, and\r\ntheir structure described. It might at least be noticed whether they are\r\nhard and clear, like pure ice, or opaque like compacted snow, or made up\r\nof concentric layers of clear and opaque ice alternately.\r\n\r\n_Snow._—Snow falls in all parts of the world, although in tropical or\r\nsub-tropical latitudes only at great elevations above sea-level. The\r\nactual limits of snowfall at sea-level are as yet imperfectly known, and\r\nany observations of snow showers in the neighbourhood of the tropics\r\nare of importance. It is essential in such a case to record also the\r\napproximate elevation of the land. On mountains in all latitudes the\r\nposition of the snow-line should be noted at every opportunity. This is\r\nthe line above which snow lies permanently all the year round, or below\r\nwhich snow completely melts in summer; and it is a climatic factor of\r\nsome importance. It may be remarked, for instance, that if the traveller\r\nfinds snow lying on grass, moss, or other vegetation, he is certainly\r\nnot above the snow-line. It is necessary also to notice that glaciers\r\nmay descend unmelted a long distance below the level of perpetual snow.\r\nWhile the conditions of snow lying on the ground in the Arctic regions\r\nand above the snow-line in any part of the world are matters pertaining\r\nmore to geology and mountaineering than to meteorology, the duration of\r\nsnow-showers, the character of the snow, and the depth to which it lies\r\non ground below the snow-line are too important from their bearing on\r\nclimatology to be overlooked.\r\n\r\nThe character of the snow as it falls varies from the sleety, half-melted\r\ndrops common in warm air to the fine dust of hard, separate ice-crystals\r\nfound in the intense cold of a Polar or Continental winter. The feathery\r\nappearance of lightly-felted flakes is an intermediate type between the\r\ntwo extremes. In measuring the depth of snow as it lies, care should be\r\ntaken to select open ground where there is no drifting, and when the\r\nsnow is not too deep the measurement can usually be best made with a\r\nwalking-stick on which a scale of feet and inches (or of centimetres)\r\nhas been cut. Such a stick is useful for measuring the depth of shallow\r\nstreams, and for many other purposes. The result should be entered as\r\n“depth of fallen snow,” so that there may be no risk of confusing the\r\nfigures with the amount of snowfall estimated as rain. Speaking roughly,\r\na foot of snow is usually held to represent an inch of rain. A violent\r\nstorm of wind, accompanied with falling or driving snow, is termed a\r\n_blizzard_ in the western United States, and a _buran_ in Siberia. The\r\nname blizzard has been naturalized in the Antarctic, but it is not known\r\nthat this phenomenon is identical with the American storm.\r\n\r\n_Frost._—The appearance of frost in the form of hoar-frost (the way\r\nin which atmospheric water-vapour is deposited in air below the\r\nfreezing-point), or of thin ice formed on exposed water, should always\r\nbe carefully looked for and noted. In hot, dry countries the intense\r\nradiation from the ground at night often reduces the temperature below\r\nthe freezing-point, although, during the day, the ground may be very hot.\r\nThe appearance of frost at sunrise is a valuable check on the readings\r\nof a minimum thermometer, and in most cases is a more trustworthy datum.\r\nSimilarly in cold countries, where snow is lying on the ground or ice\r\ncovering the rivers, the appearance of thaw, especially in cloudy\r\nweather, is a delicate test of the rise of the air temperature to the\r\nfreezing-point. The traveller should never fail to record cases of\r\nmelting and solidifying of any substances due to changes of temperature.\r\nThe softening of candles and the freezing of mercury or of spirits give\r\ninformation regarding temperature at least as valuable as the readings of\r\nthermometers.\r\n\r\n_Other Observations._—Any peculiar atmospheric phenomena, such as the\r\nappearance of the zodiacal light after sunset, the aurora, the electrical\r\nlights seen on pointed objects, and known as St. Elmo’s fire, rainbows,\r\nespecially lunar rainbows, haloes, the appearance of mock-suns or moons,\r\nmeteors or shooting stars, should be noted on their occurrence, as many\r\nof them are valuable weather prognostics. Attention should also be given\r\nto any appearances of mirage, or other effects of irregular distribution\r\nof atmospheric density. A mirage is only rarely so perfect as to show\r\nships inverted in the air, palm-grown islands in the sea, or distant\r\noases in the desert. The common form is an unusual intensification of\r\nrefraction, raising land below the horizon into sight, or apparently\r\ncutting off the edges of headlands or islands at sea or on large lakes.\r\nIt is worth while observing the temperature of the air and of the water\r\nor ground when an unusually clear mirage effect is visible.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting series of observations may be made on the colours of\r\nthe sky and clouds at sunrise and sunset. A phenomenon often observed at\r\nsunset, but the existence of which is still sometimes denied, should be\r\nlooked for. This is the appearance of a gleam of coloured light at the\r\nmoment when the upper edge of the sun dips below a cloudless horizon. A\r\nnote should be made of the nature of the horizon, whether land or sea,\r\nand of the colour of the light if it should be observed. When opportunity\r\noffers, the first ray of the rising sun might be similarly observed.\r\n\r\nThe traveller should, at the end of each day, give his opinion of the\r\nnature of the weather, saying whether he felt it hot or cold, relaxing\r\nor bracing, close or fresh. Such observations have no necessary relation\r\nto degree of temperature or humidity as recorded by instruments; but\r\nthe human body is the most important of all instruments, and everything\r\nwhich affects it should be studied. By paying attention to the foregoing\r\ninstructions, an observant traveller will bring home a far better\r\nmeteorological log without instruments than a more careless person\r\ncould produce by the diligent reading of many scales. Yet, in enforcing\r\nthe importance of non-instrumental observations, we must not leave the\r\nimpression that the readings of instruments are of little value. It is,\r\nin ordinary circumstances, only by the readings of instruments that the\r\nclimate of one place can be compared with that of another, and only the\r\nbest results of instrumental work are precise enough to form a basis for\r\nclimatological maps.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTRUMENTAL OBSERVATIONS.\r\n\r\nThe minimum requirement of instrumental observations by a traveller is\r\nthe reading twice daily of the barometer and of the dry and wet bulb\r\nthermometers, to ascertain the temperature and humidity of the air,\r\nalso the reading once daily, in the morning, of the minimum thermometer\r\nwhich has been exposed all night, and on days in camp of the maximum\r\nthermometer also. It is very desirable to expose a rain gauge whenever\r\nit is practicable to do so. Unless special meteorological researches are\r\nto be carried out, nothing farther in the way of observations need be\r\nattempted. A very useful supplement to the necessary observations is the\r\nuse of a self-recording barograph or thermograph; but these are delicate\r\ninstruments, liable to get out of order unless very carefully handled,\r\nand it will not always be possible to make use of them.\r\n\r\nThe observer must understand what his instruments are intended to\r\nmeasure, how they act, and how they should be exposed, read, and the\r\nreading recorded. He must know enough about all these things to be\r\nable to dispense with unnecessary precautions only possible at fixed\r\nobservatories, and, at the same time, to neglect nothing that is\r\nnecessary to secure accuracy in the results.\r\n\r\n_Thermometer Corrections._—All thermometers, without exception, should\r\nhave the degree marks engraved on the stem, or on a slip of enamel within\r\nthe outer tube, and be supplied with a certificate from the National\r\nPhysical Laboratory showing the error of the scale at different points.\r\nThis certificate should be in duplicate, and a copy ought to be left\r\nin a safe place at home. After a long journey the thermometers which\r\nhave been in use should be sent to have their errors re-determined. The\r\ncorrections are not, however, to be applied by the observer unless he is\r\nworking out his observations for some special purpose. No thermometer is\r\npassed at the National Physical Laboratory if its error approaches one\r\ndegree, so that for all ordinary purposes of description a certificated\r\nthermometer may be looked on as correct. But when the readings are being\r\ncritically discussed and compared with the observations of other people,\r\nthe correction is of the greatest importance. _It cannot be too strongly\r\nimpressed upon an observer that, in reading meteorological instruments,\r\nhe must read exactly what they mark, and record that figure in his\r\nobservation-book on the spot._ The corrections can be applied afterwards\r\nby the specialist who discusses the work. For subsequent reference it is\r\nnecessary to note in the observation-book the registered N.P.L. number\r\nof the thermometer in use, and if a thermometer should get broken and\r\nanother be used instead, the number of the new instrument must be noted\r\nat the date where it is first employed. Care should be taken to use the\r\nsame thermometer for one purpose all the time if possible, and only an\r\naccident to the instrument should necessitate a change being made.\r\n\r\nThermometers are either direct-reading or self-registering. The former\r\nare used for obtaining the temperature at any given moment, the latter\r\nfor ascertaining the highest or the lowest temperature in a certain\r\ninterval of time. They are filled either with mercury, or a light fluid\r\nwhich freezes less readily, such as alcohol or creosote.\r\n\r\n_Thermometer Scales._—The particular system on which the thermometers are\r\ngraduated is of no importance, but merely a matter of convenience. The\r\nFahrenheit scale is used for meteorological purposes in English-speaking\r\ncountries; but for all other scientific purposes the Centigrade scale\r\nis used everywhere. One can be translated into the other very simply\r\nby calculation[2]; but it is convenient for a traveller to have all his\r\nthermometers graduated in accordance with one scale only.\r\n\r\nThe graduation, as marked on the stem of the thermometer, is usually to\r\nsingle degrees, but anyone can learn to read to tenths of a degree by\r\na little practice. Care must be taken to have the eye opposite the top\r\nof the mercury column. Suppose it to be between 50 and 51, the exact\r\nnumber of tenths above 50 is to be estimated thus: If the mercury is just\r\nvisible above the degree mark it is 50°.1, if distinctly above the mark\r\n50°.2, if nearly one-third of the way to the next mark 50°.3, if almost\r\nhalf-way 50°.4, exactly half-way 50°.5, a little more than half-way\r\n50°.6, about two-thirds of the way 50°.7, if nearly up to the next mark\r\n50°.8, and if just lower than the mark of 51° it is 50°.9. The eye soon\r\nbecomes accustomed to estimating these distances.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.—_Reading Thermometer Scale above and below Zero._]\r\n\r\nIn using a thermometer below zero, the observer must pay attention to\r\nthe change in the direction of reading the scale, the fractions of a\r\ndegree counting downward from the degree mark instead of upward from\r\nit, as in readings above zero. Readings below the zero of the scale are\r\ndistinguished in recording them by prefixing the minus sign. The annexed\r\nfigure shows the reading of two thermometers graduated to fifths of\r\na degree, one showing a temperature of 1°.4, the other of -1°.4. The\r\nBritish Meteorological Office now recommends the use of the Centigrade\r\nthermometer graduated from the absolute zero, _i.e._, the freezing point\r\nis shown by 273°, the boiling point as 373°.\r\n\r\n_Care of Thermometers._—Mercurial thermometers will always be employed\r\nfor ordinary purposes in places where the temperature is not likely\r\nto fall to -40°: _i.e._, everywhere except in the polar regions and\r\nthe interior of continents north of 50° N. These thermometers are very\r\nstrong and are not easily broken except by violence. The one vulnerable\r\npart is the bulb, which is of thin glass and filled with heavy mercury.\r\nHence, in carrying thermometers, care has to be taken to protect the bulb\r\nfrom coming in contact with any hard object. The best way to carry an\r\nunmounted thermometer is in a closed brass or vulcanite tube with a screw\r\ntop, the inside of the tube being lined with india-rubber and provided\r\nwith a cushion of cotton-wool for the bulb to rest on. If the thermometer\r\nis mounted in a wooden frame it should be secured in a box so that the\r\nframe is firmly held and the bulb projects into a vacant part of the box,\r\nwhich may be lightly filled with cotton-wool or provided with a deep and\r\nwell-padded recess. Every thermometer which is not graduated above 120°\r\nshould have an expansion at the top of the tube which the mercury that\r\nmay be driven beyond the scale by over-heating will not fill; otherwise\r\nany accidental over-heating will break the bulb.\r\n\r\nThe unavoidable shaking or any sudden shock during travelling is apt\r\nto cause the mercury column to separate, and a portion of it may be\r\ndriven to the top of the tube, where it may remain unless looked for and\r\nbrought back. Hence it is important to see that the top of the bore of\r\nthe tube is visible, and not covered by any attachment holding the tube\r\nto a wooden frame. Thermometer readings are absolutely valueless unless\r\nthe whole of the mercury fills the bulb and forms a continuous column in\r\nthe stem. To bring a broken column together the best plan is to invert\r\nthe thermometer, if necessary shaking it gently, until the mercury flows\r\nfrom the bulb and entirely fills the tube, leaving a little vacant dimple\r\nin the mass of mercury in the bulb. When this is done, the thermometer\r\nshould be brought into its normal position bulb downwards, and the column\r\nwill usually be found to have united. If this method does not succeed the\r\nthermometer may be held in the hand by the upper end, raised to the full\r\nstretch of the arm, and swung downwards through a wide arc with a steady\r\nsweep. I have never known this method to fail.\r\n\r\n_Thermometer Screens._—It is usual at fixed stations to expose the\r\nthermometer to the air by hanging it in a screen made of louvre-boards\r\nso arranged that the air penetrates it freely while the direct rays of\r\nthe sun are cut off. The Stevenson screen, constructed on this plan with\r\na door opening on the side away from the sun, is well adapted for use\r\nin temperate countries; but it is too cumbrous to carry on a journey and\r\ndoes not afford sufficient ventilation for use in tropical countries.\r\nAn excellent substitute is the canvas screen devised by the late Mr. H.\r\nF. Blanford, which consists of a bamboo frame carrying the thermometers\r\n(with their bulbs four feet from the ground). The whole structure is five\r\nfeet high, and is sufficient for any places where the wind is moderate.\r\nIt is constructed of bamboos or rods of light wood, cords, and canvas,\r\nwhich may readily be made up before starting, and it is easily renewed\r\nor repaired. The canvas roof should be triple or quadruple according\r\nto the thickness of the material. Such a screen will afford sufficient\r\nprotection at night, or even in the day, if set up in the shade, and it\r\nwill throw off rain; but in the sun it will require a thick mat as an\r\nadditional protection on or preferably stretched above the roof.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.—_Mr. H. F. Blanford’s Portable Thermometer\r\nScreen._]\r\n\r\nFor a more permanent station the form of exposure recommended by a\r\ncommittee of the British Association for use in tropical Africa will be\r\nfound very suitable in hot countries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.—_Hut for Sheltering Thermometers._]\r\n\r\nThe thermometers are placed in a galvanised iron cage, which is kept\r\nlocked for safety. This cage is suspended under a thatched shelter,\r\nwhich should be situated in an open spot at some distance from buildings.\r\nIt must be well ventilated, and protect the instruments from being\r\nexposed to sunshine or rain, or to radiation from the ground. A simple\r\nhut, made of materials available on the spot, would answer this purpose.\r\nSuch a hut is shown in the drawing (Fig. 2). A gabled roof with broad\r\neaves, the ridge of which runs from north to south, is fixed upon four\r\nposts, standing four feet apart. Two additional posts may be introduced\r\nto support the ends of the ridge beam. The roof at each end projects\r\nabout eighteen inches; in it are two ventilating holes. The tops of the\r\nposts are connected by bars or rails, and on a cross bar is suspended the\r\ncage with the instruments. These will then be at a height of six feet\r\nabove the ground. The gable-ends may be permanently covered in with mats\r\nor louvre-work, not interfering with the free circulation of the air, or\r\nthe hut may be circular. The roof may be covered with palm-fronds, grass,\r\nor any other material locally used by the natives for building. The floor\r\nshould not be bare but covered with grass or low shrubs.\r\n\r\nThe great object of these precautions is to obtain the true temperature\r\nof the air, and avoid the excessive heating due to the direct rays or\r\nreflected heat of the sun falling on the thermometers, and the excessive\r\ncooling due to the radiation of heat from the thermometers to a clear\r\nsky at night. Such a shelter is absolutely necessary when maximum and\r\nminimum thermometers are used; but can be dispensed with for the simple\r\nobservation of the temperature of the air at a given time. This may be\r\neffected by securing a rapid flow of air over the thermometer, either by\r\ncausing the air to flow past the instrument or by causing the instrument\r\nto move rapidly through the air. It has been found by experiment that\r\nthe true temperature of the air is obtainable in this way whether the\r\noperation is performed in sunshine or in shade; but it is preferable to\r\ndo so in the shade.\r\n\r\n_Sling Thermometer._—The sling thermometer is the most simple and\r\nconvenient of all instruments for ascertaining the temperature of the\r\nair. It is an unmounted thermometer with a cylindrical bulb, and the\r\ndegree-marks engraved on the glass stem. The upper end terminates in\r\na ring to which a silk cord about two feet long is attached. As a\r\nprecaution it is as well to secure the cord by a couple of clove hitches\r\nround the top of the thermometer stem as well as to the ring, as the\r\nthermometer would then be held securely even if the ring broke. The\r\nthermometer is used by whirling it in a vertical circle about a dozen\r\ntimes, the observer taking care, by having a loop of the string round the\r\nwrist or finger, that it is not allowed to fly off. Then the thermometer\r\nis read, swung once more, and read again. This process is repeated\r\nuntil two consecutive readings are identical; when this is the case the\r\ninstrument shows the true temperature of the air. It is sufficient to\r\nnote the final temperature in the observing book.\r\n\r\nThe risk of breaking a sling thermometer is the only drawback to its use.\r\nOnly a silk cord should be used, and it should be examined frequently\r\nto see that it has not got chafed. In swinging the thermometer, an open\r\nplace must be selected where it is not likely to come in contact with a\r\nbranch or any other object.\r\n\r\n_Hygrometers._—As the humidity or degree of moisture in the atmosphere\r\nis a very important climatic factor it is necessary to measure it as\r\ncarefully and as frequently as the temperature of the air. There are many\r\ninstruments, called psychrometers or hygrometers, for doing this; but few\r\nof them are simple enough for the use of a traveller. The proportion of\r\nwater-vapour in air is a little difficult to understand at first, because\r\nit is not a constant quantity as in the case of the other constituents of\r\nair, but varies according to the amount of water-surface exposed to the\r\nair and according to the temperature. The maximum amount of water-vapour\r\nwhich can be present in air varies with the temperature, being greater\r\nas the temperature is higher and less as the temperature is lower. Thus,\r\nif air at 50° F. contains the maximum amount of water-vapour which it\r\ncan contain at that temperature, it is said to be _saturated_, for it\r\nwill take up no more and evaporation stops; and if the temperature were\r\nto fall ever so little there would be more water-vapour present in the\r\nair than it could hold and some would separate out and condense into dew\r\nor rain, hence the temperature of saturation is called the dew-point.\r\nBut if air saturated at 50° is warmed up say to 60° it can then contain\r\nmore water-vapour than it has, and the temperature would require to\r\nfall 10° before dew or rain could form. When the air is not saturated\r\nwater exposed to it evaporates rapidly until the maximum quantity of\r\nwater-vapour is again present, a larger quantity corresponding to the\r\nhigher temperature. At any given temperature the essential thing to know\r\nabout the humidity of the air is the additional amount of water-vapour it\r\ncould take up before becoming saturated, or in other words the humidity\r\nrelative to the maximum humidity possible at the existing temperature.\r\nThe relative humidity is expressed in percentages of the maximum humidity\r\npossible (saturation) at the actual temperature of observation. It may\r\nbe measured by two methods, (1) finding the dew-point or temperature at\r\nwhich the amount of vapour present saturates the air; (2) by finding the\r\nrate at which the air allows evaporation to proceed; the farther the air\r\nis from saturation the more rapid is the rate.\r\n\r\nThe dew-point may be found directly by means of an instrument by\r\nwhich the air is cooled down until it begins to deposit moisture on a\r\npolished surface, but such an instrument is inconvenient to handle when\r\ntravelling. It may also be found indirectly by calculation from the\r\nrelative humidity.\r\n\r\nThe relative humidity is most easily calculated from the rate of\r\nevaporation. It is one of the laws of evaporation that heat is required\r\nto change liquid into vapour, and when evaporation is going on heat is\r\nbeing abstracted from surrounding bodies, and they are growing colder.\r\nBy allowing evaporation to take place from the bulb of a thermometer the\r\nrate of evaporation may be measured by the fall of temperature produced,\r\nand tables have been constructed to convert the differences between the\r\nwet and dry bulb readings into relative humidities.\r\n\r\nThe wet-bulb thermometer consists of an ordinary thermometer, the bulb of\r\nwhich is covered with clean muslin and kept moist by means of a piece of\r\ncotton lamp-wick dipping into a small vessel of pure water. Care must be\r\ntaken to have the water quite pure and free from salt, otherwise the true\r\nreduction of temperature will not be observed. Hence special precautions\r\nare necessary when observing at sea or in an arid country where the\r\nground is covered with incrustations of salt.\r\n\r\nIn any form of wet bulb thermometer when the air is much below the\r\nfreezing point, it will usually be found most satisfactory to remove the\r\nmuslin covering and allow the bulb to become covered with a coating of\r\nice, by dipping it into water and allowing the water to freeze upon it.\r\nEvaporation takes place from solid ice sufficiently rapidly to give the\r\ntrue wet-bulb readings at least with a sling thermometer.\r\n\r\nWhen the air is saturated, _i.e._, relative humidity = 100 per\r\ncent., there is no difference in the reading of the wet and dry bulb\r\nthermometers, and the greater the difference between the readings at a\r\ngiven air temperature the smaller is the relative humidity of the air.\r\n\r\nThe wet-bulb thermometer has to be exposed to the air with the same\r\nprecautions as are taken in the case of the dry bulb. The two may\r\nbe hung side by side—but at least six inches apart—in the screen or\r\ncage described on p. 15; or the wet bulb may be employed as a sling\r\nthermometer. One way to do this is to tie a muslin cap on the bulb of the\r\nsling thermometer with a piece of wet lamp-wick coiled round the upper\r\npart of the bulb, and then whirl it until the reading becomes constant,\r\ntaking care to moisten the bulb again if it should become dry. Another\r\nway is simply to twist a piece of filter-paper or blotting-paper round\r\nthe bulb, and dip it in water before swinging.\r\n\r\n_Aspiration Psychrometer._—Perhaps the most convenient form of wet and\r\ndry bulb thermometer for use by a traveller is that known as Assmann’s\r\nAspiration Psychrometer. It requires no protecting screen, is not subject\r\nto the risk attending the use of the sling thermometer, and gives an\r\nextremely close approximation to the true temperature and humidity.\r\nThe principle of the instrument is very simple. The wet and dry bulb\r\nthermometers are enclosed separately each in an open tube (see Fig. 4)\r\nthrough which a current of air is drawn by means of a fan, actuated by\r\nclockwork in the upper part of the case. In making an observation, all\r\nthat is required is to see that the water vessel for the wet bulb is\r\nfilled and the bulb properly moist, and that the dry bulb is free from\r\nany condensed moisture. The instrument is then hung to a branch or other\r\nsupport placed in the open air (or even held in the hand), preferably in\r\nthe shade, although this is not essential, and the clockwork wound up.\r\nAir will then be drawn over the bulbs for five minutes or more, and if\r\nthe temperature of each thermometer has not become steady by the time the\r\nclockwork has run down, it must be wound up again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.—_Section of Assmann’s Aspiration Psychrometer._]\r\n\r\nThe thermometers in Assmann’s Psychrometer are graduated according to the\r\nCentigrade scale, and each degree is subdivided into fifths on a slip of\r\nporcelain enclosed in the outer tube of the thermometer (see p. 13).\r\n\r\n_Minimum Thermometer._—The minimum temperature of the night can usually\r\nbe ascertained by a traveller exposing a minimum thermometer when the\r\ncamp is set up and reading it in the morning before starting on his way.\r\nThere are several forms of minimum thermometer, but the only one likely\r\nto be used is that known as Rutherford’s. It is very delicate and liable\r\nto go out of order. The instrument should be of full size, as used in\r\nmeteorological stations at home; it must be packed so as to be as free as\r\npossible from shock or vibration, and ought to be carried in a horizontal\r\nposition. The bulb is filled with alcohol or some similar clear fluid,\r\nand within the column of spirit in the stem there is included a little\r\npiece of dark glass shaped like a double-headed pin. This is the index\r\nwhich continues pointing to the lowest temperature until the instrument\r\nis disturbed or re-set. The thermometer has to be hung in a horizontal\r\nposition. When the temperature rises, the column of spirit moves along\r\nthe tube, flowing past the index without disturbing it. When the\r\ntemperature falls, the spirit returns towards the bulb, flowing past the\r\nindex _until the end of the column touches the end of the index_. The\r\nphenomenon known as surface-tension gives to the free surface of any\r\nliquid the properties of a tough film, and the smaller the area of a\r\nfree surface is, the greater is this effect of surface-tension. Hence it\r\nis that the inner surface of the column of alcohol is not penetrated by\r\nthe glass index, but draws the index with it backwards towards the bulb.\r\nAs soon as the temperature begins to rise, the alcohol once more flows\r\npast the index towards the farther end of the tube. The end of the index\r\nfarthest from the bulb remains opposite the mark on the stem indicating\r\nthe lowest temperature which had occurred since it was last set, and this\r\nreading must be taken without touching the thermometer.\r\n\r\nTo set the index it is only necessary to tilt the bulb end of the tube\r\nupwards, when the index will slide down by its own weight until it comes\r\nin contact with the inner surface of the end of the column of alcohol.\r\n\r\n_Care of a Minimum Thermometer._—The chief dangers to which a minimum\r\nthermometer are liable are three—(1) the index being shaken into the\r\nbulb, (2) the index being shaken partly or wholly out of the column of\r\nspirit, and sticking in the tube, and (3) the column of spirit becoming\r\nseparated or a portion of the spirit evaporating into the upper end of\r\nthe tube.\r\n\r\nThe thermometer should be so constructed as to make it impossible for the\r\nindex to get into the bulb, or with an index so long as not wholly to\r\nleave the tube, and this should be seen to before purchasing. When any of\r\nthe other derangements occurs the natural instinct of an observer is to\r\nimmerse the thermometer in warm water until the spirit entirely fills the\r\ntube, and then allow it to cool. The only drawback to this simple method\r\nis the almost inevitable bursting of the bulb and destruction of the\r\nthermometer. This method should never be attempted; but if the warning\r\nwere not given, the idea would be sure to occur to the observer some time\r\nor other, and he would proceed to destroy his thermometer with all the\r\nfervour of a discoverer. The only satisfactory way to rectify a deranged\r\nminimum thermometer is as follows:\r\n\r\nIf the column is separated, but the index remains in the spirit, grasp\r\nthe instrument firmly by the upper end and swing it downwards with a\r\njerk (as in the case of the mercurial thermometer mentioned on p. 23).\r\nIf the index has been shaken out of the spirit and remains sticking in\r\nthe upper part of the tube, or if a little spirit has volatilised into\r\nthe top of the tube and cannot be shaken down by the first method, a\r\nquantity of spirit should be passed into the upper end of the tube by\r\ngrasping the thermometer by the bulb end of the frame and swinging in the\r\nsame way. When the index is immersed or the drop of volatilised spirit\r\njoined on to the column, the first process of swinging by grasping the\r\nupper end of the tube will bring the instrument into working order.\r\nAfter any operation of this kind the thermometer should be kept in a\r\nvertical position bulb downwards, to allow the spirit adhering to the\r\nsides of the tube to drain back completely. Then the thermometer should\r\nbe brought into the horizontal position and set by allowing the index to\r\nslide down to the end of the column of spirit. The end of the column of\r\nspirit farther from the bulb should always show the same temperature as\r\nthe dry-bulb thermometer. If it should be observed to read a degree or\r\ntwo lower, it will be found that some of the spirit has volatilized and\r\ncondensed at the end of the tube.\r\n\r\nThe minimum thermometer should be exposed to the air four or six feet\r\nfrom the ground under a screen or roof, like that described on p. 15, so\r\nthat it is not exposed to the open sky, and the ground under the shelter\r\nshould be covered with grass or leaves, not on any account left bare. The\r\nloss of heat by radiation of the ground to the open sky will produce a\r\nnight temperature much lower than that of the air a few feet above the\r\nground, and a radiation thermometer is often employed, laid on the grass\r\nand exposed to the sky to measure this effect. Travellers, however, can\r\nrarely be expected to make observations of such a kind, as the instrument\r\nis one of extreme delicacy.\r\n\r\n_Maximum Thermometers._—Maximum registering thermometers are\r\nfilled with mercury, and are less liable to get out of order than\r\nspirit-thermometers. The simplest and best form for use by travellers is\r\nNegretti and Zambra’s. Its principle is very simple. When the temperature\r\nrises and the mercury in the bulb expands, it forces its way along the\r\nstem in the usual manner; but there is a little constriction in the\r\ntube just outside the bulb which breaks the column as the temperature\r\nbegins to fall, and so prevents the mercury in the bulb from drawing\r\nback the thread of mercury from the tube. The thermometer is hung\r\nhorizontally, and the end of the mercury farthest from the bulb always\r\nshows the highest temperature since it was last set. Before reading the\r\nthermometer, it is well to take the precaution of seeing that the inner\r\nend of the thread of mercury is in contact with the constriction in the\r\ntube, and if, by the shaking of the instrument or otherwise, the mercury\r\nhas slipped away from this position, it should be brought back to it by\r\ntilting the thermometer bulb downwards very gently, then returning it to\r\nthe horizontal position and reading.\r\n\r\nTo set this thermometer, it is only necessary to hold it vertically bulb\r\ndownwards and shake it slightly, if necessary striking the lower end of\r\nthe frame carrying the instrument, gently against the palm of the hand.\r\nThis causes the mercury to pass the constriction and re-enter the bulb.\r\nWhen set, the end of the column farther from the bulb should indicate the\r\nsame temperature as the ordinary dry-bulb thermometer.\r\n\r\nAnother form of maximum thermometer is known as Phillips’. It is an\r\nordinary mercurial thermometer, but a short length of the upper part of\r\nthe column in the tube is separated from the rest by a little bubble of\r\nair. It is used in the horizontal position, and as the temperature rises\r\nthe whole column moves forward, while, when the temperature falls, only\r\nthat portion behind the air-bubble retires towards the bulb. The tip of\r\nthe column thus remains to mark the maximum temperature to which its\r\nfarther end points. The instrument is set by gently tilting the bulb end\r\ndownwards, when the detached portion of the column at once runs back\r\nuntil stopped by the air-bubble. This is the most convenient instrument\r\nto use at a fixed station; but in travelling it is apt to get out of\r\norder as shaking may have the effect of allowing the air-bubble to escape\r\ninto the upper part of the tube, or into the bulb, and the instrument\r\ncannot easily be brought into working order again.\r\n\r\n_Rain-Gauge._—While measurements of rainfall can possess no\r\nclimatological value unless they are carried on continuously at a\r\nfixed station, some very interesting observations may be made by the\r\ntraveller both during the night when in camp, and during heavy showers\r\nwhen compelled to stop on the march. The rain-gauge is in itself the\r\nmost simple of all scientific instruments, for it consists essentially\r\nof a copper funnel to collect the rain as it falls, and a bottle to\r\ncontain what has been collected. A graduated measuring glass is the only\r\naccessory required. Rain is measured by the depth to which the water\r\nwould lie on level ground if none soaked in, evaporated or flowed away.\r\nOn an emergency, a rain-gauge can be improvised out of a biscuit tin,\r\nor any vessel with vertical sides and an unobstructed mouth. Such a\r\nvessel standing level would collect the rain, the depth of which might be\r\nmeasured by an ordinary inch-rule. It is rare, however, to find rain so\r\nheavy as to give any appreciable depth when collected in a vessel freely\r\nopen to evaporation, and in order to estimate the amount of rainfall\r\nto small fractions of an inch, the device is employed of measuring the\r\nwater collected in the receiver of the gauge in a glass jar of much\r\nsmaller diameter than the mouth of the collecting funnel. Thus, if the\r\nfunnel exposes a surface of fifty square inches, and the measuring glass\r\nhas a cross-section of one square inch, the fall of 1/50 of an inch of\r\nrain on the funnel will give a quantity of water sufficient to fill the\r\nmeasuring glass to the depth of an inch. In this way the actual rainfall\r\nmay be read to the thousandth part of an inch without trouble. The\r\nsmallest diameter for a serviceable rain-gauge is five inches, and this\r\nsize is well adapted for the traveller. A three-inch rain-gauge might\r\nbe employed, but the results obtained with it are not so satisfactory.\r\nThe rain-gauge should be placed in an open situation, so that it is not\r\nsheltered by any surrounding trees or buildings, and it ought to be\r\nfirmly fixed by placing it between three wooden pegs driven securely\r\ninto the ground. The mouth of the gauge should be level, and when the\r\ninstrument is fixed, the rim of the funnel ought to be one foot above\r\nthe ground. A spare measuring glass should be carried, but as there is\r\nalways a considerable risk of breaking such fragile objects, it is well\r\nto carry also one or two small brass measures of the capacity of half\r\nan inch, two-tenths of an inch, and one-tenth of an inch of measured\r\nrainfall. In this way, although no satisfactory record could be kept\r\nof light rainfall, a very fair estimate may be made of any torrential\r\nshowers, the half-inch measure being used first, and then the smaller\r\nmeasures, finally estimating by eye the fraction of the tenth of an inch\r\nthat remains over. It must, however, be distinctly borne in mind that an\r\nestimate formed in this way is not an accurate measurement, and the fact\r\nof using the rough method must be stated in the note-book.\r\n\r\nWhen snow falls along with rain, the melted snow is measured as\r\nequivalent to rainfall, and if the funnel of the rain-gauge should\r\ncontain some unmelted snow at the time of observation, it should be\r\nwarmed until the snow melts before a measurement is taken. When snow\r\nfalls in a strong wind the drift that occurs makes it almost impossible\r\nto measure the amount accurately, but an effort should be made to\r\nestimate the average depth of the snow over a considerable area.\r\n\r\nIf the receiving bottle of the rain-gauge should be broken by frost or\r\naccident, any other bottle may be used, or in default of a bottle, the\r\ncopper case itself will act as a receiver, although the risk of loss by\r\nevaporation, and by the wetting of a large surface in pouring out the\r\nwater, is considerably increased.\r\n\r\nAt a fixed station the rain-gauge should be read every morning. The\r\ntraveller who only exposes his rain-gauge during a halt should be careful\r\nto state the hours when it was exposed and when it was read.\r\n\r\n_Barometers._—The barometer is the most delicate, and at the same time\r\nthe most important, instrument which a meteorologist has to employ. It\r\nrequires particular care in transport, and must be very carefully mounted\r\nand read, while several accessory observations have to be made at each\r\nreading in order to ascertain the corrections required for the subsequent\r\ncalculation of the results. The function of the barometer is to measure\r\nthe pressure of the air at the time of observation, and this purpose may\r\nbe carried out by the use of two different principles. The oldest and\r\nbest method is to measure the height at which a column of heavy fluid is\r\nmaintained in a tube entirely free from air. The weight of this column is\r\nequal to the weight of a column of the atmosphere of the same sectional\r\narea. Mercury being the densest fluid is the only one usually employed,\r\nbecause the column balancing a column of the atmosphere of equal\r\nsectional area is the shortest that can be obtained, and, consequently,\r\na mercurial barometer is the most portable that can be constructed on\r\nthis principle. The mercurial barometer has come to be recognised as the\r\nstandard in all parts of the world.\r\n\r\nThe average height of the column of mercury in a barometer is about\r\nthirty inches, and, consequently, the whole instrument cannot well be\r\nmade less than three feet long, so that when account is taken of the\r\nglass tube, and the amount of mercury it contains, it is long, fragile\r\nand heavy. To avoid the disadvantages inherent in such an instrument,\r\nthe method of measuring the pressure of the air by the compression of a\r\nspring holding apart the sides of an air-free flexible metallic box was\r\ndevised, and the aneroid barometer invented. The aneroid is graduated\r\non the dial in “inches,” _i.e._, divisions each of which corresponds to\r\na change of atmospheric pressure, equal to that measured by one inch of\r\nmercury in a standard barometer. Although a carefully constructed aneroid\r\nis a very useful instrument indeed, it is not to be trusted like a\r\nmercurial barometer kept in a proper place. But a good aneroid is likely\r\nto be much more serviceable to the ordinary traveller on the march than\r\na standard mercurial barometer, every packing and unpacking of which\r\nexposes it to the risk of breakage, or to the equally fatal risk of air\r\nobtaining access to the vacuous space at the top of the tube. The scale\r\nof a barometer may be divided into millimetres, or, as now recommended\r\nby the British Meteorological Office, into millibars or thousandths of\r\na hypothetical “atmosphere.” We shall describe the Fortin barometer,\r\nwhich is best adapted for use at a fixed station, and one devised by\r\nProf. Collie and Capt. Deasy, which is portable enough for the use of\r\ntravellers.\r\n\r\n_The Fortin Barometer._—The barometer must be kept in a room with as\r\nequable a temperature as possible; the instrument must be absolutely\r\nvertical—hence it should be hung freely and not touched while it is being\r\nread; it must be in a good light, and yet be sheltered from the direct\r\nrays of the sun. The measurement of the height of any mercurial barometer\r\nis that of the difference of level between the surface of the mercury in\r\nthe tube and the surface of the mercury in the cistern. When the mercury\r\nrises in the tube it falls in the cistern, and _vice versâ_, although\r\nwhen the cistern is much wider than the tube the changes of level there\r\nare much less than those in the tube. In most barometers an arbitrary\r\ncorrection is made to allow for this change, the “inches” engraved on\r\nthe scale not being true inches. In the Fortin barometer, however, the\r\nlower end of the measuring rod is brought in contact with the mercury in\r\nthe cistern before every reading, and then the scale of inches engraved\r\non the upper part of the measuring rod gives the true height of the\r\ncolumn of mercury. In calculating the barometric pressure for purposes\r\nof comparison, five corrections have to be applied: (1) for temperature,\r\nwhich requires the temperature of the barometer at the time of reading to\r\nbe observed, (2) for altitude, which necessitates knowing the elevation\r\nof the place of observation above sea-level, (3) for the force of gravity\r\nat sea-level, which requires the latitude to be known, (4) for the\r\ncapillary attraction between the mercury and the glass tube, which is a\r\nconstant for each barometer, (5) for the slight imperfection in engraving\r\nthe scale (index error), which is also a constant for each instrument.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.—_Two Readings of the Barometer Vernier._]\r\n\r\nIt is enough for the observer at a fixed station, and to such alone can\r\nthe use of a Fortin barometer be recommended, to read the temperature on\r\nthe thermometer attached to the barometer and to read the height of the\r\nmercury in the barometer tube. These two figures he is to enter in his\r\nnote-book, and unless he is himself discussing the results, he should\r\napply no correction whatever to them. The rules for observing, then, are:—\r\n\r\n1. Read the attached thermometer and note the reading.\r\n\r\n2. Bring the surface of the mercury in the cistern into contact with the\r\nivory point which forms the extremity of the measuring rod by turning the\r\nscrew at the bottom of the cistern. The ivory point and its reflected\r\nimage in the mercury should appear just to touch each other and form a\r\ndouble cone.\r\n\r\n3. Adjust the vernier scale so that its two lower edges shall form a\r\ntangent to the _convex_ surface of the mercury. The front and back edges\r\nof the vernier, the _top_ of the mercury, and the eye of the observer are\r\nthen in the same straight line.\r\n\r\n4. Take the reading, and _enter the observation as read_ without either\r\ncorrecting it to freezing point or reducing it to the sea-level.\r\n\r\nThe scale fixed to the barometer is divided into inches, tenths, and\r\nhalf-tenths, so that each division on this scale is equal to 0.050 inch.\r\n\r\nThe small movable scale or vernier attached to the instrument enables\r\nthe observer to take more accurate readings; it is moved by a rack and\r\npinion. Twenty-four spaces on the fixed scale correspond to twenty-five\r\nspaces on the vernier; hence each space on the fixed scale is larger than\r\na space on the vernier by the twenty-fifth part of 0.050 inch, which is\r\n0.002. Every long line on the vernier (marked 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) thus\r\ncorresponds to 0.010 inch. If the lower edge of the vernier coincides\r\nwith a line on the fixed scale, and the upper edge with the twenty-fourth\r\ndivision of the latter higher up, the reading is at once supplied by\r\nthe fixed scale as in A (Fig. 5), where it is 29.500 inches. If this\r\ncoincidence does not take place, then read off the division on the fixed\r\nscale, above which the lower edge of the vernier stands. In B (Fig. 5)\r\nthis is 29.750 inches. Next look along the vernier until one of its lines\r\nis found to coincide with a line on the fixed scale. In B this will be\r\nfound to be the case with the second line above the figure “2.” The\r\nreading of the barometer is therefore:—\r\n\r\n  On fixed scale          29.750\r\n  On vernier (12 × .002)    .024\r\n                          ------\r\n  Correct reading         29.774\r\n\r\nShould two lines on the vernier be in equally near agreement with two on\r\nthe fixed scale, then the intermediate value should be adopted.\r\n\r\n5. Lower the mercury in the cistern by turning the screw at the bottom\r\nuntil the surface is well below the ivory point; this is done to prevent\r\nthe collection of impurities on the surface about the point.\r\n\r\nThe transport of barometers requires very great care in order to prevent\r\nthe introduction of air into the tube or the fracture of the tube by\r\nthe impact of the mercury against the top. To reduce the risk of these\r\naccidents, the barometer must be carried with the tube quite _full of\r\nmercury_, and in an inverted position, at least with the cistern end kept\r\nhigher than the top of the tube. The flexible cistern of the Fortin type\r\nof barometer allows of it being screwed up tight so as to fill the tube\r\nand close the lower end of it. In case of breakage, the operation of\r\nfitting a new tube is not very difficult, but unless the tube has been\r\ncarried out ready filled with mercury, this cannot well be attempted. In\r\norder to drive out the film of air adhering to the glass on the inside,\r\nit is necessary, after filling the tube, to raise its temperature to\r\nthe boiling-point of mercury. No one should attempt either to fill or\r\nto change a barometer tube unless he has had practice in doing so under\r\nexpert supervision beforehand.\r\n\r\n_The Collie Portable Mercurial Barometer._—This instrument is not likely\r\nto be broken in travelling. It is quickly set up, and from such tests\r\nas have been applied, it appears to give excellent results. The cistern\r\nand vacuum tube at the top are of equal diameter, and are connected by a\r\nflexible tube, and the difference in level of the mercury may be measured\r\ndirectly by means of a graduated rod, or as in Deasy’s mounting by means\r\nof a vernier. There is no attached thermometer, but if the instrument be\r\nused in the open air, and is exposed for ten minutes or a quarter of an\r\nhour before using, it will be sufficient to note the temperature of the\r\nair in the usual way.\r\n\r\nThe upper end (Fig. 7) is about 2.5 inches long, and contains an\r\nair-trap, into which all the air that may accidentally enter the\r\nbarometer, either by the tap leaking, through the rubber tubing, or\r\nthrough either of the joints, must find its way. The lower or reservoir\r\nend (Fig. 8) is about 4.5 inches long, and has an air-tight glass tap\r\nabout an inch below the broad part. These ends are forced into the rubber\r\ntubing, and, as an additional precaution against leakage, copper wire is\r\nbound round the joints. The scale is cut on an aluminium bar, along which\r\ntwo carriages, to which the barometer is attached, move up and down, and\r\nthey can be clamped to the bar at any place (Fig. 6). By means of the\r\nverniers attached to the carriages, which are divided to 0.002 of an\r\ninch, it is easy to estimate the height of the mercury to 0.001.\r\n\r\nTo use the barometer, the carriages are put on the scale bar; the lower\r\none is clamped at the bottom of the bar, and the upper one some inches\r\nhigher up; the barometer is attached to the carriages by clamps which fit\r\nover the joints; the rubber cap is removed from the reservoir end, the\r\ntap opened, the verniers put in the middle of their runs, and the upper\r\ncarriage moved up the bar until there is a vacuum. By means of the screws\r\non the right of the carriages the verniers are moved up or down until the\r\ntop of the mercury at each end is in line with the edges of the rings\r\nattached to the verniers, which fit round the glass ends. Both verniers\r\nare then read, and the difference gives the height of the barometer. The\r\nrubber cap on the reservoir end is merely to prevent the small quantity\r\nof mercury, which should be left above the tap when it is closed, from\r\nbeing shaken out when travelling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6. THE COLLIE BAROMETER, WITH THE DEASY MOUNTING, IN\r\nITS NORMAL WORKING POSITION.\r\n\r\nFIG. 7. THE UPPER CARRIAGE AND VERNIER ON A LARGER SCALE, WITH BAROMETER\r\nATTACHED.\r\n\r\nFIG. 8. THE LOWER CARRIAGE AND VERNIER, WITH RESERVOIR END OF BAROMETER\r\nATTACHED. (Same scale as Fig. 7.)]\r\n\r\nTo pack up the barometer, lower the upper carriage _very slowly_ until\r\nthe mercury has touched the top of the glass; then detach the barometer\r\nfrom this carriage, and either let the upper end hang vertically below\r\nthe reservoir, or detach the reservoir end from its carriage and raise\r\nit till the barometer hangs vertically. By this means the barometer is\r\ncompletely filled with mercury, and then the tap must be closed. The tube\r\nis then to be coiled away in its padded box. When too much air is found\r\nin the trap, it must be extracted by means of the air-pump.\r\n\r\n_The Aneroid Barometer._—The aneroid barometer is so convenient on\r\naccount of its portability that, although much less trustworthy than a\r\nmercurial barometer, it is much more likely to be used by a traveller.\r\nCare should be taken in using it to see that the pointer has come to a\r\nposition of equilibrium, and it should be tapped gently before reading.\r\nThe eye must be brought directly over the end of the pointer, and the\r\nreading made to one-hundredth of an inch, the barometer being held in\r\na horizontal position. Every opportunity of comparing the aneroid with\r\na standard mercurial barometer should be taken, and a note made of the\r\nreadings of both. The mercurial barometer will require to be corrected\r\nfor temperature before its indications can be used for correcting the\r\naneroid, as all good aneroids are compensated for changes of temperature.\r\nThe readings of an aneroid give a very fair idea of the changes of\r\natmospheric pressure, and are very much better than none at all, although\r\nthey cannot in any case be accepted as of the highest order of accuracy.\r\n\r\nThe Watkin mountain aneroid, which is so constructed as to be thrown into\r\ngear at the moment when it is read, appears to be free from the worst\r\nerrors of the ordinary aneroid.\r\n\r\nFor climatological purposes, it is impossible to make barometric\r\nobservations of value while travelling unless the altitude of each\r\ncamping-place is accurately known. This is practically never the case\r\nexcept when travelling along the sea-shore or the margin of a great lake\r\nthe elevation of which has been determined. But, meteorology apart,\r\nbarometric readings in any little known country are of value, because by\r\ncomparing them with simultaneous readings taken at a neighbouring fixed\r\nstation, new data as to the altitude of the country may be obtained.\r\nWhile in camp, it would be an extremely useful thing to make barometer\r\nreadings, even with an aneroid, every two hours, in order to get some\r\ninformation as to the normal daily range of atmospheric pressure.\r\n\r\n_The Boiling-point Thermometer._—The temperature at which water\r\nboils depends on the pressure of the atmosphere, so that an accurate\r\nobservation of the boiling-point of water enables the pressure of the\r\natmosphere at the moment of observation to be determined with the utmost\r\naccuracy. This method of determining atmospheric pressure having been\r\nused hitherto almost solely for the purpose of measuring altitudes, the\r\nboiling-point thermometer is usually known as the Hypsometer, but its\r\nrecords are quite as valuable for use at fixed stations as in mountain\r\nclimbing. Mr. J. Y. Buchanan recommends the use of a boiling-point\r\nthermometer with a very open scale graduated to fiftieths of a degree\r\nCentigrade and entirely enclosed in a wide glass tube through which\r\nsteam from water boiling in a copper vessel is passing. On a thermometer\r\nof this kind change of pressure can be measured by the change of\r\nboiling-point more accurately than with the aid of a mercurial barometer.\r\nSee Table, Vol. I., p. 293.\r\n\r\n2. OBSERVATIONS FOR FORECASTING THE WEATHER.—The familiar name of\r\n“weather-glass” is appropriately applied to the barometer, for in most\r\nparts of the world it is the surest indicator of any approaching storm.\r\n\r\nThe scientific prediction of the weather by means of the barometer\r\ninvolves the comparison of the simultaneous readings of barometers over\r\nas wide an area as possible, and can only be carried out where there is\r\na complete telegraph system and a public department charged with the\r\nwork. The storms of wind and rain which break the more usual steady\r\nweather are usually associated with the formation of centres of low\r\natmospheric pressure towards which wind blows in from every side. These\r\natmospheric depressions move, as a rule, in fairly regular tracks, the\r\nrate of movement of the centre of the depression having no relation to\r\nthe rate at which the wind blows or to the direction of the wind. The\r\nterm _cyclone_ is usually applied to such a moving depression, because of\r\nthe rotating winds round the centre; but the size of a cyclone may vary\r\nfrom a vast atmospheric eddy extending across the whole breadth of the\r\nAtlantic to one only a few miles in diameter. The strength of the wind in\r\na cyclone depends on the barometric gradient; in other words, the greater\r\nthe difference in atmospheric pressure between two neighbouring points\r\nthe stronger is the wind that blows between them. Or, when a cyclone is\r\npassing over an observer, the more rapidly the barometer falls _or rises_\r\nthe stronger may the wind be expected to blow.\r\n\r\nIn direct contrast to the cyclone or depression is the system of high\r\npressure rising to a centre from which the wind blows out on every\r\nside. This is called an anticyclone, and is a condition which, once\r\nestablished, may last for many days, or even weeks, without change. It is\r\nthe typical condition for dry calm weather in all parts of the world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.—CYCLONE PATHS AND CIRCULATION OF WINDS IN CYCLONES\r\nIN THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN HEMISPHERES.]\r\n\r\nThe direction of movement of the centres of cyclones in the northern\r\nhemisphere is usually westward and northward near the equator, the\r\npath of the centre bending to the right as it proceeds, and becoming\r\nultimately eastward and southward. In the southern hemisphere the\r\ndirection of the centre near the equator is westward and southward,\r\nturning towards the left as it proceeds. The rotation of the wind about\r\nthe centre of a cyclone in the northern hemisphere is inwards towards\r\nthe centre in the direction opposite to the hands of a watch, and in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere it is in the direction in which the hands of a watch\r\nmove (Fig. 9). In the centre of a cyclone there is a calm, a well-known\r\ndanger to sailing ships caught in such a storm at sea, because there is\r\nno wind to move the vessel, but a tremendous sea driven in from the gale\r\nwhich rages all round from every point of the compass. The law of storms\r\nhas been very fully studied, and rules have been drawn up to enable\r\nsailors to ascertain the direction in which the centre of an approaching\r\ncyclone lies and the direction in which it is moving. In a work intended\r\nmainly for travellers on land it is not necessary to give these rules;\r\nall that is required is to tell how the approach of dangerous storms may\r\nbe ascertained some time in advance. The fact that the barometer is high\r\nor low is in itself of no value for prediction. The important thing to\r\nknow is the distribution of atmospheric pressure at a given moment over a\r\nconsiderable area. To the isolated observer this is impossible, and he\r\ncan only judge of the state of the atmosphere by observing the _rate_ at\r\nwhich the barometer is falling or rising. Thus, if for several days the\r\nbarometer has been steadily and slowly rising, he will probably be right\r\nin believing that an anticyclonic condition is establishing itself, and\r\nthat the weather may be expected to continue fine for many days to come,\r\neven after a gradual fall of the barometer begins. A sudden fall of the\r\nbarometer, on the other hand, is always a sign of wind, and usually of\r\nwet weather as well. This is a particularly valuable sign of approaching\r\nstorm in those parts of the world where, as in the tropics, the normal\r\nweather is very uniform and steady. In such places a very sudden fall,\r\nsay one-tenth of an inch in an hour, is a sure precursor of a violent\r\nstorm. As the barometer continues to fall, the wind will probably\r\ncontinue to increase in force, and when the barometer reaches its lowest\r\npoint it will either fall calm (if the centre of the cyclone is passing\r\nover the observer) or suddenly change in direction. The rapid rise of the\r\nbarometer after a great depression is also always accompanied by strong\r\nwind, though not so frequently by rain.\r\n\r\nIt must be clearly understood that these remarks refer only to\r\nobservations at a fixed station. If a fall of barometer is observed\r\nin travelling, it may be due either to a change in the state of the\r\natmosphere or to a change in the traveller’s height above sea-level.\r\nThis is the reason why it is absolutely essential, in making barometric\r\nestimates of height (or boiling-point determinations), to have\r\nsimultaneous observations going on at a base-station, or preferably at a\r\nseries of intermediate stations.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary prognostics of the approach of rain or bad weather differ\r\nin different localities, and require a considerable amount of local\r\nknowledge before they can be utilised. The peculiar absorption band in\r\nthe solar spectrum due to the water vapour of the Earth’s atmosphere,\r\nand called the rain-band, is a valuable guide to an experienced observer\r\nwith a spectroscope in predicting rain. The only instrument, however,\r\nlikely to be useful to the ordinary traveller is the wet and dry bulb\r\nthermometer. When the two thermometers have the same reading, indicating\r\nsaturation of water vapour, or when they approach at temperatures above\r\n60° F. within two degrees or so, rain may be expected, or possibly mist.\r\nThe appearance of low clouds clinging to the hillsides is an indication\r\nthat the temperature at the place where they are is below the dew-point.\r\nThe appearance of the upper clouds, taken in conjunction with the\r\nreadings of the barometer, is a valuable indication of forthcoming\r\nweather changes. The increase of cirrus clouds in a clear sky with a\r\nfalling barometer, or the appearance of a solar or lunar halo, may be\r\ntaken as a sure sign of an approaching cyclone, the intensity of which\r\nmay be foreseen by the _rate_ at which the barometer is falling.\r\n\r\nWhile the weather of places on the west coasts of temperate continents\r\nexposed to the prevailing sea-wind is usually made up of a succession\r\nof cyclones of different degrees of intensity, and of the anticyclonic\r\nintervals between them, over the greater part of the Earth’s surface the\r\nclimate is much more uniform, and the seasonal changes are the principal\r\ncause of changes of weather. To understand these general conditions it is\r\nnecessary to consider the elements of climatology.\r\n\r\n3. OUTLINES OF CLIMATOLOGY.—The air is in constant movement on account\r\nof the unequal way in which the heat of the sun falls on different\r\nparts of the Earth’s surface, and at different seasons of the year. All\r\nthe conditions of the atmosphere show a certain diurnal periodicity\r\nwhich is most marked in the regions of steady climate between and\r\nnear the tropics. Thus, as a rule, the minimum temperature of the air\r\noccurs just before sunrise, the maximum temperature from two to three\r\nhours after noon. The amount of difference between the maximum and\r\nminimum temperature of the day (daily range) is least near the sea or\r\nin wet regions (a maritime climate) and greatest in the interior of\r\nthe continents, especially where the rainfall is slight (a continental\r\nclimate). Over the sea itself the daily range of air temperature averages\r\nonly 3 Fahrenheit degrees; but in the heart of a continent, especially in\r\na desert, it may exceed 60 Fahrenheit degrees.\r\n\r\nDiurnal changes of pressure are proportionally much smaller in amount\r\nthan changes of temperature, and are to be observed as a regular\r\nphenomenon only in the tropics, or elsewhere during very settled weather.\r\nThere are usually two maxima daily, about 10 A.M. and 10 P.M., and two\r\nminima occurring about 4 A.M. and 4 P.M. It is only in rare cases that\r\nthe total barometric range exceeds 0.10 inch, very frequently it is not\r\ngreater than 0.04 inch. Still it is convenient to remember in the tropics\r\nthat a fall of the barometer not greater than 0.10 inch between 10 A.M.\r\nand 4 P.M. is to be expected, and does not indicate either the approach\r\nof a storm (if the observer is at rest) or the ascent of 100 feet (if he\r\nis on the march).\r\n\r\nAssociated with the diurnal changes of temperature in settled weather are\r\nchanges of wind due to local configuration of the ground. The wind, for\r\nexample, usually blows up a mountain side, or up a steep valley, during\r\nthe day, and down a mountain, or down a steep valley, during the night.\r\nSo, too, the regular land and sea breezes found on the borders of the sea\r\nor of great lakes blow from water to land in the day time and from land\r\nto water at night. Here the determining cause is the fact that land is\r\nwarmed and cooled by radiation, and in turn heats or chills the air much\r\nmore than water does. In the settled climates of high tropical plateaus\r\na regular diurnal change of wind direction has been observed, the wind\r\nblowing successively from all points of the compass.\r\n\r\nA similar diurnal periodicity occurs in the amount of cloud, in the\r\nmoisture of the air, the fall of rain, the occurrence of thunderstorms,\r\netc. It is also to be noticed in the flow of rivers in mountainous\r\nregions where the streams take their rise from glaciers or snow, the\r\nrapid melting of which by the heat of the sun causes the volume of water\r\nto increase greatly in the afternoon, while the cessation or reduction of\r\nthe rate of melting at night diminishes the volume of the river in the\r\nmorning and forenoon.\r\n\r\nPeriodic changes of greater amount but similar in kind are produced by\r\nthe alternation of the seasons, the difference between the mean values\r\nof the months in which the phenomena are at a maximum and minimum\r\nrespectively being termed the annual range. With regard to temperature,\r\nvery moderate changes occur in the tropical zones where the altitude\r\nof the noon-day sun is always great, and the length of day and night\r\nvaries little with the season (for the most part less than 5 Fahrenheit\r\ndegrees); but in the temperate and frigid zones there are strongly marked\r\nannual changes. As in the case of daily range, proximity to the sea is\r\na controlling factor in the annual range of temperature. To take a very\r\ncharacteristic instance, the annual range between the mean temperature of\r\nJuly and January is about 23 Fahrenheit degrees in the Lofoten islands\r\non the margin of the Atlantic, while it is 120 Fahrenheit degrees at\r\nVerkhoyansk in the same latitude, but in the centre of the Asiatic\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nThe extreme months for air temperature are January and July in almost\r\nevery part of the world, the maximum occurring north of the equatorial\r\nbelt in July and south of it in January.\r\n\r\nThe annual changes in barometric pressure and wind are equally marked.\r\nThe belt of low pressure which lies nearly under the vertical sun moves\r\nnorthward over the surface of the globe in the northern summer, coming\r\nto its most northerly position in July: returning southward after the\r\nsun, it reaches its most southerly position in January. This belt of\r\nlow pressure is also a belt of calms, known by sailors as the Doldrums,\r\nand it is a belt of frequent rains, so that as it approaches and passes\r\nover a place there is a rainy season, followed by a dry season when it\r\nretires. Near the mean position of the belt of low pressure, where it\r\npasses over a place twice in the year, there are two rainy seasons.\r\nThe low pressure belt is bordered to north and south by belts of high\r\natmospheric pressure, from which the trade-winds blow towards the\r\nequator, and the westerly anti-trades blow towards the poles. These are\r\nalso subject to the annual change; but the different action of land and\r\nsea on the distribution of pressure exercises a greater influence than\r\ndoes the difference of latitude. As the greater heating and cooling of\r\nthe land each day causes the phenomena of daily land and sea breezes,\r\nso the greater heating and cooling of the land between summer and\r\nwinter causes seasonal land and sea winds, blowing from land to sea in\r\nwinter, from sea to land in summer. Generally speaking, the pressure is\r\ngreater—in the same latitude—where the air is cooler, so that outside the\r\nfrigid zones cold areas are usually areas of high pressure, from which\r\nwind blows out in every direction, while warm areas are areas of low\r\npressure towards which wind blows in on every side.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of rainfall on the land is dependent on the direction\r\nof the rain-bringing wind and the configuration of the surface. Thus\r\nwhen the rain-bringing wind meets a mountain range, it deposits a great\r\nrainfall on the exposed slopes, but passes over as a dry wind which\r\nyields little rain to the region beyond. In places where the wind changes\r\nwith the season, as in southern Asia, the distribution of rainfall is\r\nentirely different during the continuance of the different monsoons.\r\n\r\nAll these questions of normal climate can be more easily illustrated on\r\nmaps than explained by words. But the reader must be cautioned against\r\ntaking the condensed and generalised representations of small-scale maps\r\nas showing all that is known on the subject. Even the magnificent plates\r\nin the ‘Atlas of Meteorology,’ which forms part of Bartholomew’s Physical\r\nAtlas, cannot show everything that is known; and in many parts of the\r\nworld so little has yet been ascertained as to the climatic conditions\r\nthat generations of observers will be required to make it possible for\r\nmeteorologists to draw a uniform trustworthy map of the whole world\r\nshowing the distribution of any one element of climate.\r\n\r\n_Isothermal maps._—The principle of an isothermal map is that of\r\nrepresenting the distribution of temperature by drawing lines through\r\nall the places where the temperature is the same at a given time. It is\r\nusual to take this time as an average month in an average year. Thus in\r\na map of isotherms for January (see p. 50), what is shown is not the\r\ntemperature of any particular day in any particular January, but that\r\nof an average day in a long series of Januaries. Hence it is not likely\r\nthat the _exact_ distribution of temperature shown in the map will\r\never be found on any January day; but it is to be expected that most\r\ndays in every January will have a distribution of temperature which is\r\nvery similar to that shown. The same is of course true of maps showing\r\npressure, or rainfall, or any other average condition.\r\n\r\nAgain, the isotherm is necessarily constructed from average temperatures\r\nwhich have been corrected so as to be applicable to the same level. On\r\nthe equator, for instance, the summit of a lofty mountain is seen by\r\nthe snow on it to have a temperature not exceeding 32° F., while at\r\nsea-level the temperature may be 90°. But observations have been made\r\nshowing the rate at which the temperature of the air diminishes as the\r\nheight increases, and although the rate varies in different places and\r\nat different seasons, it may be taken roughly as one Fahrenheit degree\r\nin 300 feet. Now if the mountain top with a temperature of say 30° F.\r\nis known to be 18,000 feet above the sea, the addition of 1° for every\r\n300 feet, or 60° altogether, would give the temperature of 90° as that\r\ncorresponding to sea-level. By applying such corrections, the isothermal\r\nmaps have been constructed to show the distribution of temperature at the\r\nlevel of the sea. In order to compare the temperature he has observed\r\nwith that on the map the observer must calculate the average of his daily\r\nobservations for the month in question, and then make the correction for\r\nthe altitude of his station.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, in ascertaining from an isothermal map the mean temperature\r\nof a particular place, care must be taken to subtract from the number\r\nof degrees of the isotherm passing through the place one degree for\r\nevery 300 feet of elevation. Of course it will usually happen that no\r\nisotherm as shown on the map runs through the point the mean temperature\r\nof which it is desired to obtain. In that case the temperature at the\r\npoint will be found by considering its relative position between the two\r\nnearest isotherms. Thus, if it lie half-way between the lines of 60°\r\nand 70°—measured perpendicularly to the isotherms—the temperature of\r\n65° may be assumed; if it lies one-tenth of the distance from 60° and\r\nnine-tenths from 70°, it is safe to assume 61°; if three-tenths from 70°\r\nand seven-tenths from 60°, then assume 67°. If the point lie in a loop\r\nof a single isotherm, _e.g._, Cape St. Roque, the eastern point of South\r\nAmerica in the map for January, lying within the 80° isotherm, one can\r\nonly guess that the temperature is above 80° and it may be assumed to be\r\nbelow 85°. The method of representation is unsatisfactory in such a case.\r\n\r\nThese facts being borne in mind, the study of isotherm maps will be found\r\nto give an excellent general idea of the distribution of climate at\r\nsea-level, and if the contour lines of 600 and 6000 feet are traced on\r\nthe maps the areas within which corrections of over -2° and -20° have to\r\nbe applied to the isothermal values to get the temperature at the place\r\nwill be easily recognised.\r\n\r\n_Isobaric Maps._—Isobars are drawn from the data of the height of the\r\nbarometer corrected to sea-level values and to the temperature of 32°\r\nF., exactly in the same way as isotherms are drawn from the data of\r\nthermometer readings or contour lines from data of altitude measurements.\r\nThe practical value of the study of isobars is very great, because of the\r\nimportance of assuming a probable value of sea-level pressure in reducing\r\nthe barometric or boiling-point thermometer readings for determining\r\nelevation, and also because of the intimate relation between the form and\r\nproximity of isobars and the direction and force of the winds.\r\n\r\nBarometric gradient is measured by the difference between the isobars per\r\nunit of length. For instance, gradient is frequently expressed in the\r\nnumber of hundredths of an inch difference between barometers fifteen\r\nnautical miles apart. The greater the gradient of pressure is, the more\r\nclosely together must the isobars be drawn in order to represent it. For\r\nexample, in the isobaric map for January (p. 50) a very steep gradient is\r\nshown on the east coast of Asia, north of Japan, and a remarkably gentle\r\ngradient in the interior of Asia from the Black Sea eastward. The steeper\r\nthe gradient the stronger is the wind.\r\n\r\nThe arrows in the isobaric maps (which are represented flying with the\r\nwind) show the average directions of the wind over the world for the\r\nmonths in question. The relation they bear to the isobars becomes clear\r\non inspection, although, on account of the greater number of observations\r\navailable for some parts of the world than for others, all the arrows are\r\nnot drawn with the same amount of certainty, and the direction of a few\r\ncontradicts that of most. As a general rule, the following facts may be\r\ntaken as absolutely established: (1) Wherever there is a region of high\r\npressure the wind blows out from it in all directions. (2) Wherever there\r\nis a region of low pressure the wind blows in towards it from every side.\r\n(3) The wind never blows perpendicularly to the isobars or directly from\r\nhigher to lower pressure, but always in a curved or spiral path inclined\r\nto the isobars. (4) In the northern hemisphere the wind blows out from\r\na high pressure area in the same direction as the hands of a watch\r\nmove, but in the southern hemisphere in the opposite direction. Also in\r\nthe northern hemisphere the wind blows into a low-pressure area in the\r\ndirection opposite to that of the hands of a watch and in the southern\r\nhemisphere in the same direction as the hands of a watch move. (5)\r\nRecognising that the wind blows nearly parallel to the direction of the\r\nisobars, the following statement (known as Buys Ballot’s Law) expresses\r\nits direction both for high-pressure and for low-pressure areas: If you\r\nstand with the lower pressure on your left hand, and the higher pressure\r\non your right hand, in the northern hemisphere the wind will be blowing\r\non your back, but in the southern hemisphere in your face.\r\n\r\n_Rainfall Maps._—Rainfall is represented on maps by lines of equal\r\nprecipitation termed Isohyets. These represent actual figures without\r\nreduction for elevation or other local conditions, and a rainfall map\r\ncan consequently be studied as a direct record of observed facts. The\r\nmap (p. 50) of mean annual rainfall brings out clearly the equatorial\r\nzone of heavy rains crossing the Amazon valley, the Congo valley, the\r\nsoutheastern peninsulas of Asia and the Malay archipelago. North and\r\nsouth of this belt are the nearly rainless regions of the tropical\r\ndeserts, extended northward and southward over the continents, and\r\nmerging nearer the poles into the fairly-watered temperate zones. The\r\nrainfall maps for separate months show the intimate relation between\r\nrainfall and the direction of the wind taken in conjunction with the\r\nconfiguration of the land. Even on the coast, when the prevailing wind\r\nis off shore, there may be scarcely any rain, as on the west coast of\r\ntropical South America. In the very heart of a continent the rainfall\r\nmay be very heavy where the sea-wind blows across a great plain before\r\nstriking the mountains, as is illustrated by the eastern slope of the\r\nAndes. Rainfall is, however, one of the most inconstant elements of\r\nmeteorology, and the actual rainfall of any year may differ very widely\r\nfrom the average. The practical value of exact statistics of rainfall\r\nis, however, greater than that of any other climatological condition; for\r\nthe water supply and the fertility of the land depend in every case on\r\nthe rain that falls either locally or on the heights of the water-sheds.\r\n\r\nIn order to pursue the subject further the chapters on the atmosphere in\r\nthe writer’s ‘Realm of Nature’ (London, Murray; New York, Scribner) and\r\nMr. L. C. W. Bonacina’s ‘Climatic Control’ (London, A. and C. Black) may\r\nbe useful. The most systematic treatment of climatology will be found in\r\nHann’s ‘Handbuch der Klimatologie,’ 3 vols. (Stuttgart), which contains\r\nnumerous references to special works; the essential part of this treatise\r\nis translated by Professor R. de C. Ward, under the title of ‘Handbook of\r\nClimatology,’ Part I. (Macmillan). The most important work of all is the\r\ngreat ‘Atlas of Meteorology’ by Dr. A. Buchan and Dr. A. J. Herbertson,\r\nforming Vol. III. of Bartholomew’s ‘Atlas of Physical Geography’ (London,\r\nConstable), which gives an unrivalled series of climate and weather-maps\r\nwith explanatory letterpress.\r\n\r\nThe recent great advances in meteorology have rendered the old textbooks\r\nobsolete, while the new data, especially those regarding the upper\r\nregions of the atmosphere, have not yet been built into a coherent\r\nsystem. Sir Napier Shaw’s ‘Forecasting Weather’ (London, Constable &\r\nCo.) is a pioneer discussion, and the numerous publications of the\r\nMeteorological Office, South Kensington, London, S.W.7, may be consulted\r\nwith much advantage.\r\n\r\nDaily synoptical weather-maps are published by the Weather Service of\r\nalmost every civilised country. Those for the United Kingdom may be\r\nobtained from the Meteorological Office of the Air Ministry. The only\r\nweather-maps of large areas produced regularly are the Pilot Charts\r\nof the North Atlantic and the North Pacific, published monthly by the\r\nHydrographic Office at Washington, and those of the North Atlantic and\r\nMediterranean published monthly by the Meteorological Office in London.\r\nThese show the tracks of cyclones, and give a great deal of information\r\nas to the meteorology and currents of the oceans. They are intended\r\nprimarily for the use of sailors.\r\n\r\nThe following list gives the name of the official weather service of\r\nall countries outside Europe and the town in which the head office\r\nis situated. Application might be made to any of these offices for\r\ninformation as to the stations where standard instruments are established\r\nin the country in question.\r\n\r\n  EXTRA-EUROPEAN WEATHER SERVICES.\r\n\r\n  ===================+====================================+================\r\n  Country.           |                 Name.              |  Place.\r\n  ===================+====================================+================\r\n  _America_:—        |                                    |\r\n                     |                                    |\r\n  Canada             | Meteorological Service of the      |\r\n                     |   Dominion of Canada               | Toronto.\r\n  United States and  |                                    |\r\n    West Indies      | Weather Bureau                     | Washington.\r\n  Mexico             | Observatorio meteorologico         |\r\n                     |   magnetico central                | Mexico.\r\n  Salvador           | Observatorio Astronomico y         | San Salvador.\r\n                     |   Meteorologico                    |\r\n  Guatemala          | Instituto fisico-geografico        | San José.\r\n  Cuba               | Real Colegio de Belen de la        |\r\n                     |   compania de Jesus                | Havana.\r\n  Brazil             | Central Meteorological Department  |\r\n                     |   of the Navy                      | Rio de Janeiro.\r\n  Uruguay            | Observatorio meteorologico del     |\r\n                     |   colegio pio de Villa Colon       | Montevideo.\r\n  Argentina          | Oficina meteorologica Argentina    | Buenos Aires.\r\n  Chile              | Oficina meteorologica              | Santiago.\r\n  Peru               | Harvard College Observatory        | Arequipa.\r\n                     |                                    |\r\n  _Africa_:—         |                                    |\r\n                     |                                    |\r\n  Algeria            | Service météorologique             | Algiers.\r\n  British Central    |                                    |\r\n    Africa           |                                    | Zomba.\r\n  Egypt              | Observatory                        | Helwan.\r\n  Madagascar         | Observatoire                       | Tananarive.\r\n  Mauritius          | Royal Alfred Observatory           | Pamplemousses.\r\n  Union of South     | Meteorological Branch, Irrigation  |\r\n    Africa           |   Department                       | Johannesburg.\r\n                     |                                    |\r\n  _Asia_:—           |                                    |\r\n                     |                                    |\r\n  India              | Meteorological Department          | Calcutta.\r\n  Japan              | Central Meteorological Observatory | Tokyo.\r\n  Ceylon             | Surveyor-General’s Office          | Colombo.\r\n  Hongkong           | Observatory                        | Hongkong.\r\n  China              | Imperial Maritime Customs          | Peking.\r\n    ”                | Observatoire de Zi-ka-wei          | Shanghai.\r\n  Philippine Islands | Weather Bureau                     | Manila.\r\n  Dutch East Indies  | Magnetic and Meteorological        | Batavia.\r\n                     |   Observatory                      |\r\n                     |                                    |\r\n  _Australasia and   |                                    |\r\n    Pacific_:—       |                                    |\r\n                     |                                    |\r\n  Australia          | Commonwealth Meteorological Service| Melbourne.\r\n  New Zealand        | Meteorological Office              | Wellington.\r\n  Hawaii             | Weather Bureau                     | Honolulu.\r\n  ===================+====================================+================\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above, which are regular government services specially\r\norganised for publishing and utilising the data from numerous observing\r\nstations, there are many isolated stations in all parts of the world.\r\nThere are no colonies which do not possess some meteorological stations,\r\nand at many mission stations meteorological observations are made. It\r\nwould always be well for a traveller to try to ascertain where in the\r\nvicinity of his route meteorological stations have been established and\r\nover what period of time their records extend.\r\n\r\nIn the Table (pp. 44-49), taken from Marriott’s “Hints to Meteorological\r\nObservers,” is given the relative humidity for every 2° of temperature\r\nfrom 20° to 80°, and for every two-tenths of a degree of difference\r\nbetween the dry and wet-bulb readings from 0°·2 to 18°·0.\r\n\r\nTo use the Table: Look in the column on the left or right for the nearest\r\ndegree to the dry-bulb reading; then carry the eye horizontally along\r\nuntil the column is reached corresponding to the difference between the\r\nreadings of the dry and wet-bulb thermometers, when the relative humidity\r\nwill be found. Intermediate readings can be interpolated in the usual way.\r\n\r\n_Example:_ Dry-bulb 58°·5, wet-bulb 52°·7, the difference is 5°·8. Having\r\nfound 58° in the column on the left or right, run the eye along this line\r\nuntil the column under 5°·8 is reached, when the relative humidity will\r\nbe found, viz., 67.\r\n\r\n  TABLE OF

The camera and materials\r\nnecessary for a journey may be readily obtained, so designed as to\r\nminimise space and weight, and in every way so perfectly adapted to\r\nthe traveller’s needs as to ensure successful results in every variety\r\nof climate, and render the operation of taking a photograph extremely\r\nsimple. It is necessary, however, that the traveller should make himself\r\nmaster of the principles involved in the production of a successful\r\nphotograph, as he will have to depend on his personal effort in exposing\r\nand developing the plate, etc. He should also acquire a knowledge of the\r\nconstruction of the camera, to enable him to effect slight repairs when\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nIn selecting an outfit he must first decide upon the size of plate to be\r\ncarried, and that need not exceed what is termed “half-plate,” 6½ × 4¾\r\ninches; which is large enough for the best work. The smallest effective\r\nsize for scientific work may be “quarter-plate,” 4¾ × 3¼ inches; in\r\nuse in many hand-cameras. Negatives on this scale, if perfect, may\r\nbe enlarged for book illustration, or printed as lantern slides. The\r\ntwo sizes given form a very complete outfit when extra weight may be\r\nconveniently carried.\r\n\r\n_Selecting a Camera._—The cameras should have bellows bodies of Russian\r\nleather which folds into small space, the woodwork must be well seasoned\r\nto prevent warping, or cracking under a hot sun. The framework should be\r\nmetal-bound at the corners, and the camera fitted with a rising front and\r\nswing back, although the swing back is not indispensable. A reversible\r\nback (now universal) is of advantage, as it enables the operator to\r\ntake vertical or horizontal views without turning the camera on its\r\nside. If the camera is fitted with a swing-front, the swing-back becomes\r\nunnecessary. The swing-front is in all ways preferable to the swing-back.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BELLOWS CAMERA.]\r\n\r\n_The Hand-camera._—Hand-cameras are designed to carry a dozen or more\r\nplates or films in flat sheets or in spools, so arranged inside the\r\ncamera as to be changed after each exposure by simply turning a milled\r\nhead, or moving a lever. Rolled films are not recommended for travellers’\r\nuse in hot and humid climates. Sir Martin Conway says: “A traveller who\r\ncarries glass plates and flat films will probably bring home a larger\r\npercentage of good negatives from a long mountain journey than one who\r\nrelies upon spools of films.” There can be no question about the force\r\nand accuracy of this statement. My own experience goes to prove that a\r\ncamera arranged for glass plates and flat films is best.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TWIN-LENS CAMERA (OPEN).]\r\n\r\nThe twin-lens hand-camera made by Ross, of New Bond Street, London,\r\noffers several advantages in its design. It is fitted with a focal-plain\r\nshutter which is in every way simple and effective. The twin lenses are\r\nof equal focal length, enabling the object to be photographed to be seen\r\non the same scale as it will appear in the finished negative, so that\r\njust what is required may be embraced in the field. It consists of a\r\nstout body of thoroughly seasoned hardwood, not easily damaged by rough\r\nusage. The principal fittings required for adjusting the instrument are\r\ninside, protected by the outer case. The exception to this arrangement\r\nis the milled head by means of which the two lenses are focussed at the\r\nsame time. The lenses are of uniform focal length, so that the image\r\ntransmitted by the “finder” is a counterpart of the image which falls\r\nupon the sensitive plate. The advantage of this is that the object to be\r\ntaken is seen on the finder-screen to scale exactly as it will appear\r\nin the finished photograph. By this means the operator has it in his\r\npower to place the object in the required position on the screen at the\r\nmoment of exposure. This is of signal importance if the object is moving\r\nabout. It must also be noted that this form of camera may be used when\r\nthe operator is facing at right angles to the object to be photographed.\r\nI have frequently found that natives of foreign countries resent the\r\nliberty taken of pointing a camera at them, and fly as if they expected\r\nto be shot. The slides are each made to hold two plates, or flat films.\r\nThey are strong, serviceable, and easily managed, while the body of the\r\ncamera is so arranged as to carry a roll holder. The camera can also be\r\nadapted to stereoscopic work, and fitted for the use of glass plates,\r\nflat films, or rolled films.\r\n\r\nA light tripod stand should be taken for supporting the camera when\r\nlonger exposures are required than can be given in the hand. A very\r\nsatisfactory compromise has been adopted by Sir W. Abney between using\r\nthe camera in the hand and on a tripod. He rests the camera on top of\r\na walking-stick when making hand exposures, with the result that he\r\novercomes all tremor caused by pulsation, and so secures photographs full\r\nof sharp detail.\r\n\r\nThe same object is obtained by the reflex type of camera in which the\r\nimage formed by the lens is thrown upon a silver-faced mirror and\r\nreflected upward to the focussing screen. Focussing can be carried out,\r\nand a moving object followed till the moment when the exposure is made.\r\nThe reflex type of camera is a trifle less bulky than the twin-lens, and,\r\nof course, only one high class and expensive lens is required.\r\n\r\n_A Focussing-cloth._—This is used for keeping out the light while\r\nfocussing, being thrown over the camera and the head of the operator.\r\nIt is generally made of black velvet, but waterproof sheeting is much\r\nbetter. It should have rings sewn on to one edge, or some arrangement by\r\nwhich it may be attached to the camera so as not to be blown away.\r\n\r\n_Camera-stand._—There are many varieties of tripod stands, with legs\r\neither folding or sliding into a small compass. For mountainous country\r\nit is of great advantage to have a stand with telescopic legs, as they\r\ncan be readily altered in length so as to stand firmly on slopes or rocky\r\nground. The smallest size, weighing about 3 lbs., and measuring 33 in.\r\nlong when closed, and standing about 4 ft. 6 in. high, is steady enough\r\nto support a 6½ × 4¾ camera without perceptible vibration in a moderate\r\nwind.\r\n\r\n_A Small Circular Cup Level_, let into the wood of the camera, for\r\nlevelling the camera on the tripod, is a useful addition.\r\n\r\n_Lenses._—There are many lenses in the market, and as it is impossible\r\nto do good work with an inferior lens, it is necessary to exercise great\r\ncare in selecting this part of a photographic outfit. Lenses known as\r\nrectilinear or symmetrical are useful to a scientific explorer, and are\r\nwell fitted for producing pictorial effect in his work.\r\n\r\nOrdinary portrait lenses are designed specially for rapid work, and\r\nthis is attained at the cost of qualities in a lens most useful to an\r\nexplorer. The so-called portrait combination should therefore be avoided.\r\n\r\nRectilinear and symmetrical lenses give true images of objects to be\r\nphotographed free from distortion, so that straight lines are reproduced\r\nas straight lines. In this way they are invaluable where accurate\r\nmeasurements have to be taken from photographs produced by them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOMOCENTRIC LENS.]\r\n\r\nRoss’s homocentric lens is one of the most useful lenses. It has a flat\r\nfield, is free from what is called “coma” and astigmatism, and is so\r\nperfectly corrected as to fit it for interior and exterior work alike. It\r\nis also a rapid hand-camera lens. The homocentric are made in series to\r\nsuit all cameras. Other lenses may also be noted, viz.: _c._ Dallmeyer’s\r\nrapid rectilinear, including about 37°. _d._ Zeiss’s anastigmat, made\r\nby Ross, consists of a double front lens and a triple back lens. It\r\nis intended for portraits, groups, copying, and general outdoor work.\r\nThe combinations being brought closely together, gives them great\r\nilluminating power. They have an angular aperture of from 858 to 908, and\r\ncan therefore be used as wide-angle lenses when desired. In consequence\r\nof the peculiar system of correction for oblique pencils adopted in these\r\nlenses, they behave somewhat differently from the usual types with regard\r\nto the mode of compensating the effect of the resulting aberrations\r\nbetween centre and margin of the field. This is, of course, only possible\r\nin the case of perfectly plane objects. In all other cases—landscape,\r\ninstantaneous work, or interiors—the centre should be focussed rather\r\nthan objects at a distance or foreground.\r\n\r\n_Focus._—It will be sufficient to say that focal length means the\r\ndistance between the diaphragm of a lens, and the ground-glass screen\r\nwhen the image of a distant object is seen most distinctly on the screen.\r\n\r\n_Exposure Tables._—Exposure tables are based on the focal length of a\r\nlens, in relation to the diameter of the diaphragm of a lens. Thus,\r\nif the focus is eight inches and diameter of diaphragm one inch, the\r\nrelationship will be expressed by _f_/8 or by the uniform standard\r\nnumber 4, and so on, as in table. The diaphragms are so arranged for\r\nsize of opening that each succeeding number requires double the exposure\r\nnecessary with the one preceding it. _f_/11.3, for example, requires\r\ndouble the exposure wanted with _f_/8.\r\n\r\n  U. S. Nos.       4     8     16    32   64    128   256\r\n                  _f_   _f_    _f_   _f_  _f_    _f_   _f_\r\n  Ratio of Stops. ---   ----  ---   ----  ---   ---   ---\r\n                   8    11.3   16   22.6  32   45.2    64\r\n\r\nSuch tables are useful guides to the relative duration of exposure with\r\ndiaphragms of different sizes applied to the same lens. They afford no\r\nclue, however, to time of exposure to be given with any particular lens\r\nor diaphragm. This can be best ascertained by experience, as duration of\r\nexposure of a plate or film in the camera depends on the sensitiveness\r\nof the plate, the time of day, the sun, the state of the atmosphere,\r\nthe nearness or distance of the object to be photographed, etc. To take\r\nan extreme case of the difference of time required to impress the plate\r\nwith the image of an exterior view and that of an interior, a landscape\r\nopen and well lighted may be taken in the fraction of a second, while a\r\ndimly-lighted interior with the same lens would require an hour, both\r\nbeing taken with plates coated with the same emulsion. The duration of\r\nexposure may be approximately estimated by using an exposure meter such\r\nas may be obtained from any photographic dealer’s. It is useful to keep\r\nan exposure record; a handy book for this purpose is published by Messrs.\r\nBurroughs & Welcome. In this book rules are set down for exposure during\r\ndifferent months of the year and for different latitudes. These are apt\r\nto prove misleading to the amateur. The simplest method of measuring\r\nthe actinic power of light in any latitude, and at any moment, is by\r\nactinometer, giving plate-speeds, focus of lens, etc. Watkins “Bee\r\nMeters” are excellent for this purpose.\r\n\r\n_Sensitive Plates or Films._—Gelatine plates are now made commercially by\r\na large number of firms and of great excellence; they keep indefinitely\r\nbefore exposure, and for a long time afterwards and before development\r\nand under some circumstances (as for instantaneous pictures, portraits,\r\nand dimly-lighted interiors) will give results which could hardly be\r\nobtained at all on collodion plates. Gelatine plates are made of various\r\ndegrees of sensitiveness; the slowest are best for ordinary landscape\r\nwork. They are generally supplied in parcels of a dozen each, packed face\r\nto face with strips of folded paper between opposite edges. The card\r\nboxes in which they are usually packed are an insufficient protection\r\nagainst injury and damp. In all cases it is advisable, and for sea\r\nvoyages and damp climates essential, to have each package of a dozen\r\nplates soldered down in a tin case, and afterwards packed in a light\r\nwooden box with tow or cotton wool, and the box screwed (not nailed)\r\ndown. In packing them up again after exposure or after development, a\r\ngood plan (due to Sir W. Abney) is to provide oneself with a number of\r\ncardboard frames exactly the size of the plates, made of strips of card\r\nabout ¼ in. wide, one of which is inserted between every two plates film\r\nto film. The packages thus made up should be soldered down again, and\r\ntreated with at least as much care as the original plates in packing.\r\nShould there be no available means of resoldering the boxes, it will be\r\nbetter to have tin boxes with the lid turned well down, the joinings to\r\nbe closed by strong well-gummed paper or medical rubber strapping. It\r\nwill also be well to be provided with a supply of waterproof paper, or\r\ncloth, as an additional precaution in packing and in case of emergencies.\r\n\r\nSensitive films in rolls or spools are made by the Kodak and other\r\ncompanies, and may be used successfully in their proper roll-holders\r\nwhen they can be kept perfectly dry in temperate climates. Flat films\r\nmade by Kodak, Ltd., and others have many advantages for travellers. The\r\ncelluloid of which they are made is very much lighter than glass, and\r\nin exposure and development may be treated in the same way as a glass\r\nplate. When plates can be carried, the extra weight is compensated for by\r\ngreater certainty of success, and general excellence in the photographs.\r\n\r\n_How to Keep Plates and Films Dry._—When the traveller has a long journey\r\nbefore him, and the prospect of storing his plates and films for months\r\nboth before and after exposure, it is of the greatest importance that\r\nprecautions should be taken against the inroads of damp. This applies\r\nwith full force when the country to be explored has a hot, humid climate.\r\nPlates and films that have absorbed moisture, causing decomposition in\r\nthe sensitive gelatine coating, are frequently brought back to this\r\ncountry to be developed, and are the most fruitful cause of failure. The\r\nremedy is simple, but can only be applied when packing and repacking\r\nthe plates. Some guarantee should be sought from makers of plates and\r\nfilms that they are packed perfectly dry, and that the packing used is\r\nalso dry. Assuming that work has to be done in a damp climate and that\r\nthe plates have been exposed in the camera and require to be repacked,\r\nthey should be dried in a box containing a small quantity of chloride\r\nof calcium. The box used for drying may be also designed to carry the\r\ncamera and outfit. It should have a lid with a rim of rubber padding, so\r\nthat by putting the lid on and a weight on it, the box would be fairly\r\nair-tight. Stack the exposed plates, or films, in the bottom of box, so\r\nseparated as to permit the passage of air between. Place a cup or saucer\r\non the bottom of box containing chloride of calcium. (The chloride should\r\nbe first dried on a piece of iron over a fire.) Put on the lid and allow\r\nthe plates to remain for an hour or more. Dry all the packing materials,\r\nremove the plates from the box and repack. The chloride will have\r\nabsorbed the moisture in the plates, and rendered them quite dry and safe\r\nfor preserving for an indefinite length of time.\r\n\r\n_Apparatus and chemicals for development._—The development of the plates\r\nor films after exposure in the camera requires practice and experience\r\nin order to secure the best results. Instructions for development\r\nare sent out with all commercial plates or papers, but many failures\r\nwould certainly result from attempting to work by these without some\r\npreliminary practice at home. As plates, &c., will keep after exposure\r\n(if well protected from damp) for 18 months, or longer if properly\r\npacked, it is not, of course, necessary to develop them _en route_,\r\nalthough if the traveller possess sufficient skill, and if ample\r\nwater-supply and other facilities can be secured, it will be advantageous\r\nfor many reasons to do so. On a long journey, when the temperature is\r\nnot too high, use of convenient resting-places may be made to develop\r\nfrom time to time a few plates selected from the whole, both as tests\r\nfor exposure and as proof that all the apparatus is in order. The\r\nfollowing list comprises all that is absolutely required for developing\r\n8 or 10 dozen gelatine plates:—Three papier-mâché dishes, two 3-ounce\r\nglass measures, three 6-ounce bottles, containing strong solutions of\r\npyrogallic acid preserved with potassium meta-bisulphite, potassium\r\nbromide, and sodium carbonate respectively, 1 lb. hyposulphite of soda,\r\nand ¼ lb. alum, both in crystals, 4 or 5 feet of india-rubber tubing and\r\na spring clip, to make a syphon for a water supply from a jug or can, a\r\nbasin or tub to serve as a sink, a folding rack for draining the plates.\r\n\r\nThere are several convenient new developing agents in the market:\r\nHydro-Kinone, Eikonogen, Glycin, Metol, Rodinal, and Amidol. Some of\r\nthese were made and named in Germany, they are no longer procurable under\r\ntheir German names. English manufacturers are however making substitutes\r\nquite as good under new names, and these can be obtained from the\r\ndealers. Many of them can be obtained in compressed form.\r\n\r\nThe traveller is recommended for advanced study of photography, such\r\nworks as Instructions in Photography by Sir Wm. Abney, The Science and\r\nArt of Photography by Chapman Jones, and The Manual of Photographic\r\nExposure and Development by Alfred Watkins, which may be had from any\r\nphotographic dealer’s.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the traveller-photographer should be the production of good\r\n_negatives_. It often requires years of study on the part of professional\r\noperators (with advantages impossible to the traveller) before thoroughly\r\ngood negatives are habitually produced; and it must not be supposed that\r\na person taking up photography for the first time, in a few hurried\r\nmoments before departure on a journey, will attain other than very\r\nunsatisfactory results.\r\n\r\nThe operations necessary for taking a picture are briefly as\r\nfollows:—Having selected the position from which the view is to be\r\ntaken (for valuable hints as to the _artistic_ production of pictures\r\nsee Robinson’s ‘Pictorial Effect in Photography’), the tripod stand is\r\nfirst set up, and the head approximately levelled by means of the pocket\r\nlevel, altering the position or length of the legs as may be necessary.\r\nThe camera is next screwed on to the stand, and the lens selected which\r\non trial is found to include the required amount of subject. For groups\r\nor portraits a long focus lens with wide aperture, such as Dallmeyer’s\r\n“Rapid rectilinear,” 11 in. focus, should be used. The next operation\r\nis to focus the picture accurately on the ground-glass screen of the\r\ncamera. The focussing-cloth is thrown over the head and the camera,\r\nso as to exclude the light as much as possible, and while looking at\r\nthe inverted image on the ground glass, the milled head of the rack\r\nadjustment is turned till the image appears as sharp as possible. The\r\ncamera is now turned about on its vertical axis till it exactly includes\r\nthe view intended to be taken, and the screw is tightened. It may be\r\nnecessary to raise or lower the front of the camera carrying the lens\r\nin order to include objects at a high or low elevation; if the vertical\r\nrange of this sliding front is insufficient, the camera must be tilted;\r\nbut, if this is done, care must be taken to set the focussing-screen\r\nvertical again by means of the swing back, and to readjust the focus.\r\nThe full aperture of the lens should always be used for focussing,\r\nand if the image is not sharp all over the plate it will be necessary\r\nto insert a diaphragm in the lens, using the largest that will effect\r\nthe required object. Having then put the cap on the lens, the hinged\r\nframe carrying the focussing-glass is turned over, and one of the\r\nslides carrying the sensitive plates is inserted in its place. The\r\nslides should be exposed as little as possible to the light, especially\r\navoiding direct sunlight; however carefully constructed, it is difficult\r\nto make them absolutely light-tight. The shutter of the slide is then\r\nwithdrawn, and the exposure made by removing the cap from the lens for\r\ntime exposure, and by a spring shutter for instantaneous work. The time\r\nof exposure must be estimated according to circumstances, and it requires\r\nconsiderable experience to judge of it accurately. A record should be\r\nkept in a note-book of every plate exposed, giving the number, date,\r\ntime, exposure, subject, &c. If the plates cannot be developed the same\r\nevening, and the slides are wanted for fresh plates, they must be packed\r\nup again, and should be numbered. This is best done by marking the number\r\non the back with a bit of dry soap, or in the film with a lead pencil.\r\nThe image on the plate after exposure is latent and invisible, and has\r\nto be developed. This is effected by pouring on the plate, laid in one\r\nof the flat dishes, a dilute solution containing pyrogallic acid, soda,\r\nand potassium bromide. The excellence of the result largely depends on\r\nthe due proportion between these constituents, and here more experience\r\nis perhaps necessary than in any other part of the process. The image\r\nhaving been fully developed, the plate is well washed, and then immersed\r\nin a solution of alum, which hardens the film. After another thorough\r\nwashing it is “fixed” by immersion in a solution of sodium hyposulphite,\r\nwhich dissolves out the unchanged bromide of silver, and, being once\r\nmore well washed, it is finished, and must be set up in the rack to dry\r\nspontaneously. On no account must heat be applied, not even the warmth\r\nof sunlight, or the wet film will melt. When dry it must be varnished\r\nto protect the film. The printing operations are best deferred till\r\nthe return home, as they would involve the carriage of a large amount\r\nof extra apparatus. It is generally best to get the printing done by a\r\nprofessional printer; but if the traveller prefers to print from his own\r\nnegatives he will find full instructions in each packet of paper which he\r\nbuys.\r\n\r\nColour sensitive plates are now much used and, when a yellow glass filter\r\nis placed immediately in front of, or behind, the lens, will give in\r\nthe print the same variations in depth of tint which the eye sees in\r\nthe landscape, or other object. The nearest to perfection among these\r\nplates are those known as Panchromatic, but they must be developed in\r\ntotal darkness. The subject is a large one and should be studied in the\r\npamphlets on ‘orthochromation’ published by Kodak (Wratten Division), and\r\nIlford, Ltd.\r\n\r\nAs regards the expense of a photographic outfit, at the present time\r\nthe manufacturing trade is still very unsettled, some goods cannot be\r\nsupplied, and all have been greatly increased in price. Quarter plates\r\nwhich used to be sold at a shilling per dozen are now about 3_s._ 6_d._\r\nApplication should be made to the dealers for current prices.\r\n\r\nThe camera, slides and lenses may be arranged to pack into a solid\r\nleather case, conveniently in the form of a knapsack, measuring about\r\n16 in. wide, 12 in. high, and 5 in. deep. This can easily be carried on\r\nthe back of one man, and is of a more convenient shape than the cases\r\ngenerally sold for the purpose.\r\n\r\nThe plates and other apparatus, with the exception of the knapsack and\r\nits contents, and the tripod stand, are best packed for travelling in a\r\nstrong basket, which is much better than a box, being more elastic and\r\nlighter. It will weigh, when packed with the apparatus, and a gross of 7½\r\n× 5 plates, about 60 lbs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Photography in Natural Colours._\r\n\r\nIt is now possible for the traveller to bring home records of what he has\r\nseen in natural colours. There are two or three known methods by which\r\nthis may be done, but few are available for the work of exploration. The\r\npicture obtained by the method patented by Mr. Ives and named Krōmskōp\r\nPhotography is produced by three monochrome images. These have however\r\nbeen taken through three tinted glasses in a camera of a special kind.\r\nThe images may be thrown upon a screen by means of a special lantern; the\r\nlight passes through tinted glasses of colours complementary to those\r\nemployed in making the negatives with the result that the picture on the\r\nscreen exhibits all the varied hues of nature. The devices however are\r\nexceedingly expensive and can be satisfactorily employed only by those\r\nwho thoroughly understand the apparatus and the problems which have to be\r\nsolved.\r\n\r\nSimpler processes are the Autochromic and The Paget Colour Plate process.\r\nIn the Autochromic process the manufacturers coat a sheet of glass\r\nwith minute specks of three colours, blue, violet green and orange,\r\nirregularly spread, and lay a coat of panchromatic emulsion on top. The\r\nphotographer exposes through the glass, thus obtaining a negative. The\r\ndeveloped silver, the negative image, is dissolved away and the silver\r\nbromide remaining is developed giving a positive image in natural colours.\r\n\r\nIn the Paget process the glass is coated with points of colour laid in\r\na regular pattern. This is called the screen plate and is placed in the\r\ndark slide face to face with a colour-sensitive plate, and the expression\r\nis made through the screen plate. From the negative so obtained a\r\nmonochrome positive plate is made, and this is bound up in contact with\r\none of the screen plates. Some little experience is necessary to obtain\r\ncorrect register.\r\n\r\nEach process has its difficulties. Most photographers consider that the\r\nAutochrome plate gives the nearest approach to natural colours, but the\r\nslides are very dense and require an intense light to show them well. The\r\nPaget plate is much more transparent and possesses the advantage that any\r\nnumber of positives may be made from the negative, whereas the Autochrome\r\nplate having been converted into a positive cannot be multiplied,\r\nresembling in that particular the earliest form of photography, the\r\nDaguerrotype.\r\n\r\nNone of these colour processes are suitable for photographing objects in\r\nmotion. The exposures may be reckoned as from fifteen to twenty times as\r\nlong as with an ordinary slow plate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nGEOLOGY.\r\n\r\n_By THE LATE W. T. BLANDFORD, F.R.S._\r\n\r\n_Revised by PROF. E. J. GARWOOD, F.R.S._\r\n\r\n\r\nA traveller who has not devoted some time to studying geology in the\r\nfield must not be surprised or disappointed if the rocks of any country\r\nwhich he may happen to traverse appear to him a hopeless puzzle. If he\r\ndesires to investigate the geological structure of an unknown region, he\r\nshould previously devote some time to mastering, with the aid of a good\r\ngeological map and description, the details of some well-known tract.\r\n\r\nUnder the term “Geological Observations,” two very distinct types of\r\ninquiry are commonly confounded. The first of these, to which the name\r\nof Geological Investigation ought properly to be restricted, consists\r\nin an examination of the rocks of a country as a whole, so as to\r\nenable a geological map, or, at all events, geological sections, to\r\nbe constructed. This demands a knowledge of rocks (petrology), some\r\nacquaintance with the details of geological surveying, and, usually,\r\nwith the elements of palæontology—a science that, in its turn, requires\r\na preliminary study of biology, and especially of zoology. Despite all\r\nthese hard terms, any intending traveller who has a taste for geology—if\r\nhe has none he had better not waste time upon the subject—will find that\r\na few months’ study in any good museum, a course of geological lectures,\r\nand, above all, a few days in the field with a good geologist, will start\r\nhim very fairly equipped with the great requisite to all successful\r\nscientific investigation, a knowledge of how to observe, and what to\r\nobserve.\r\n\r\nThe term “Geological Observations” is, however, often, but incorrectly,\r\nused in a second sense, which implies a restriction of the observations\r\nto the useful minerals found in any country, or to what is termed\r\neconomic geology. Here also a preliminary knowledge of the elements of\r\ngeological science will be found very useful, and will frequently enable\r\nthe traveller to form much more trustworthy conclusions as to the nature\r\nand value of mineral deposits than he could without such a guide. But the\r\nessential point is to recognise a valuable mineral when seen, and for\r\nthis some knowledge of mineralogy is requisite.\r\n\r\n_Outfit._—The essential articles of a geologist’s outfit are neither\r\nnumerous nor cumbrous. A very large proportion of the known geology of\r\nthe world has been made out with no more elaborate appliances than a\r\nhammer, a pocket compass with a small index to serve as a clinometer,\r\na pocket-lens, a note-book and a pencil. No scientific observer has to\r\ndepend more on his own knowledge and faculty for observation, and less on\r\ninstrumental appliances, than a geologist.\r\n\r\nThe best hammer for general purposes should weigh from 12 to 24 oz. and\r\nshould have a square flat end, and a straight cutting end—the latter\r\nshould be horizontal, and the inner face of the hammer a continuous plane\r\nsurface. The ends should be of steel, not too highly tempered. The hole\r\nfor the handle should be as large as possible (with a small hole the\r\nhandles are so weak as to be liable to break), and the handle should be\r\nsecured in the hole by a wooden wedge, and an iron one driven into and\r\nacross the wooden one. It is advisable to take a few spare ash handles\r\nand iron wedges. Cut a foot-measure in notches on the handle—this is very\r\nuseful for measuring thickness of beds, &c. It is as well to have more\r\nthan one hammer in case of loss, and if fossil-collecting is anticipated,\r\nat least one heavy hammer, with one end fashioned to serve as a pick,\r\nthree or four cold chisels of various sizes, and a short crow-bar will\r\nbe found useful. In London, hammers, chisels, &c., may be procured of\r\nMessrs. Buck, 242, Tottenham Court Road.\r\n\r\nA very good pocket compass, the shape and size of a watch, with a\r\nclinometer arm, is made by Troughton and Simms, 138, Fleet Street. The\r\nuse of the clinometer is for measuring the angle of dip in rocks. If more\r\naccuracy of measurement is required than is afforded by looking at a bed,\r\na section, or a hill-side, and holding the straight-edge attached to the\r\ncompass parallel to the dip, and if a surface can be found that affords\r\nthe exact inclination, it is usually practicable, by means of a note-book\r\nlaid on the rock surface, or, better still, a folding two-foot rule\r\nwith a slot for sliding in the compass-clinometer, to obtain a plane\r\nsufficiently close to that at which the beds dip to enable the angle to\r\nbe determined with a very short straight-edge. As a rule, except with\r\nvery low angles of dip, the variation in the inclination of the rocks\r\nthemselves exceeds the limits of error of the instrument. A little care,\r\nhowever, is necessary in taking dips; for the apparent dip seen in a\r\nsection, such as is often exposed in a cliff, may differ widely from the\r\ntrue dip, which will only be shown _if the section runs at right angles\r\nto the strike of the beds_. Dips seen on the sides of hills at a distance\r\nare but rarely correct for the same reason.\r\n\r\nA prismatic compass and an aneroid are frequently of great service: the\r\nformer to determine the position on the map, if one exists, and to aid in\r\nmaking a rough map, if there is none; and the latter to estimate roughly\r\nthe heights on the road travelled, especially in mountainous countries,\r\nand also to measure the thickness of horizontal beds. Both form a part of\r\nthe outfit of most modern travellers. A good aneroid gives sufficiently\r\naccurate determinations of height for a rough but adequate geological\r\nsection across any country, if the distances are known. The Watkin\r\nmountain aneroid of Hicks and Co., Hatton Garden, is the most accurate\r\nfor considerable heights.\r\n\r\n_Collections._—Geological specimens require little more than paper and\r\nboxes, or biscuit tins, for packing. Occasionally fossils or minerals are\r\nfragile, and need tow or grass to protect them from injury; but there is\r\nno risk from the animal and vegetable enemies of zoological or botanical\r\ncollections. The only important point to be borne in mind is that _every\r\nspecimen should be labelled on the spot_, or, at all events, in the\r\ncourse of the day on which it is collected. Strong paper is best for\r\nlabels, and these should not be put up in contact with the rock-fragments\r\nthemselves, or they will be worn by sharp edges and become illegible,\r\nif not rubbed to fragments. Always wrap each specimen in paper, or\r\nsome substitute, then add the label, and then an outer covering. The\r\nlabel,[3] if nothing else is written, should always record the locality\r\ndistinctly written.\r\n\r\nA collection of rock specimens may show what kinds of rock occur in a\r\ncountry, but the information afforded is very meagre, and, in general, of\r\nvery small value. Such collections, indeed, unless made by a geologist,\r\nand accompanied by notes, are scarcely worth the carriage. If such\r\nspecimens are taken, care should be used to select them from the rocks\r\nin place, _not from loose blocks_ that may have been transported from a\r\ndistance. In certain cases, however, where the traveller does not intend\r\nto penetrate beyond the low ground, pebbles brought down by streams give\r\nsome indication of the strata which occur higher in the drainage basin,\r\nand the information may be useful to future explorers, but they should\r\nalways be labelled as such. No fragments of spar or crystals should be\r\ncollected merely because they are pretty.\r\n\r\nIn taking specimens of useful minerals, such as coal or metallic ores,\r\nthe traveller should always endeavour to procure them himself from\r\nthe place of occurrence, and if such are brought to him by natives,\r\nhe should, if practicable, visit the locality whence the samples were\r\nprocured. The value of all useful minerals depends both on quality and\r\nquantity; the former can to some extent be ascertained from a sample,\r\nbut the amount available can only be estimated after a visit to the\r\nlocality. Most metallic ores occur in veins or lodes. These were\r\noriginally cracks in the rock, and have been irregularly filled with\r\nminerals, different from those in the neighbourhood. It is, however, very\r\ndifficult, and often impossible, to estimate from surface examination\r\nwhether the quantity of ore occurring in veins is likely to prove large;\r\nsome idea may possibly be obtained if underground workings exist. Many\r\nof the ores of iron and manganese, some of those of other metals, and\r\nall coal and salt occur in beds, and here it is important to see what\r\nis the thickness, and to ascertain whether the mineral is equally pure\r\nthroughout. Iron ores occur in most countries, and unless very pure\r\nand within easy reach of water-carriage, are not likely to be worth\r\ntransport. The value of salt also depends on facilities for carriage.\r\nCoal, however, may be of value anywhere; but it is improbable that seams\r\nof less thickness than four or five feet can be of much use, except in\r\ncountries where there is a skilled mining population and a considerable\r\ndemand for the mineral. It does not follow because much thinner seams\r\nare sufficiently valuable to be worked in Western Europe, that they\r\nwould pay for extraction in a country where the mechanical arts are less\r\nadvanced. Still the occurrence of thin seams is worthy of record, as\r\nthicker deposits may exist in the neighbourhood. It must not be inferred,\r\nhowever, that a seam of small thickness at the surface will become\r\nthicker below. The reverse is equally probable.\r\n\r\nA blow-pipe is extremely useful for ascertaining the nature of ores, and\r\nfor determining minerals generally, and a small blow-pipe case might be\r\nadded to a traveller’s kit, if he thinks it probable that he may meet\r\nwith minerals in any quantity. But in general they are not to be found\r\nin such profusion as to render it difficult to carry away specimens\r\nsufficient for determination at leisure. A blow-pipe, too, is of no use\r\nto any one unacquainted with the method of employing it, though this is\r\neasy to acquire.[4]\r\n\r\nTo form a rough idea of the value of iron ore, see whether it is\r\nheavy; to form some notion of the quality of coal, pile up a heap and\r\nset fire to it. If it does not burn freely, the prospects of the coal\r\nbeing useful are small. It may be anthracitic, and very valuable with\r\nproper appliances; but anthracite is not of the same general utility as\r\nbituminous coal. Good coal should burn freely, with more or less flame,\r\nand should leave but little ash, and it is preferable that the ash should\r\nbe white, not red, as the latter colour is often due to the presence of\r\npyrites, a deleterious ingredient.\r\n\r\nGold and gems have, as is well known, been procured in considerable\r\nquantities from the sands of rivers and alluvial deposits. The deposits\r\nknown to the natives of any country are often of small value, and the\r\nrude methods of washing prevalent in so many lands suffice to afford a\r\nfair idea of the wealth or poverty of the sand washed. Gold and, wherever\r\nit is found, platinum occur in grains and nuggets, easily recognised by\r\ntheir colour and their being malleable; but gems, such as diamond, ruby,\r\nsapphire, are not so easy to tell from less valuable minerals. They\r\nmay be recognised by their crystalline form and hardness. A diamond is\r\nusually found in some modification of an octahedron, and the crystalline\r\nfacets are often curved; rubies and sapphires are really differently\r\ncoloured varieties of corundum or emery, and occur, when crystalline,\r\nin six-sided pyramids or some modification. A diamond is the hardest of\r\nknown substances; nothing will scratch it, and it will scratch all other\r\nminerals. Sapphire will scratch everything except diamond. Topaz will\r\nscratch quartz.\r\n\r\nIn collecting fossils, it is useless to take many specimens of one kind\r\nunless carriage is exceptionally plentiful. Two or three good examples of\r\neach kind are usually sufficient, but as many kinds as possible should\r\nbe collected. Great care is necessary that all specimens from one bed be\r\nkept distinct from those from another stratum, even if the bed be thin\r\nand the fossils in the two beds chiefly the same species. If there is\r\na series of beds, one above the other, all containing fossils, measure\r\nthe thickness roughly, draw a sketch-section in your note-book, apply a\r\nletter or a number to each bed in succession on the sketch, and label the\r\nfossils from that bed with the same number or letter.\r\n\r\nRemains of Vertebrata, especially of mammals, birds and reptiles, are of\r\ngreat interest; but it is useless to collect fragments of bones without\r\nterminations. Skulls are much more important than other bones, and even\r\nsingle teeth are well worth collecting. After skulls, vertebræ are the\r\nmost useful parts of the skeleton, then limb bones. If complete skeletons\r\nare found, they are usually well worth some trouble in transporting. If\r\nfossil bones are found abundantly in any locality, and the traveller has\r\nno sufficient means of transport, he will do well to carry away a few\r\nskulls, or even teeth, and carefully note the locality for the benefit\r\nof future geologists and explorers. The soil of limestone caverns, and\r\nespecially the more or less consolidated loam, rubble, clay, or sand\r\nbeneath the flooring of stalagmite, if it can be examined, should always\r\nbe searched for bones, and also for indications of man or his works.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing remarks are intended for all travellers, especially for\r\nthose who have paid little or no attention to geology. It would be far\r\nbeyond the object of the present notes to attempt to give instruction\r\nin the methods of geological observation; all who wish to know more\r\nfully what questions are especially worthy of attention, should consult\r\nthe article on Geology by the late Dr. Charles Darwin and Professor.\r\nJ. Phillips in the ‘Admiralty Manual of Scientific Enquiry.’ But a\r\nfew hints may be usefully added here for those who have already some\r\nknowledge of geology, who do not require to have such terms as dip,\r\nstrike, fault, or denudation explained to them, and who are sufficiently\r\nconversant with geological phenomena to be able to distinguish\r\nsedimentary from volcanic, and metamorphic from unaltered rocks, and to\r\nrecognise granite, gneiss, schist, basalt, trachyte, slate, limestone,\r\nsandstone, shale, &c., in the field. Assuming then that a traveller with\r\nsome knowledge of field geology is making a journey through a tract of\r\nthe earth’s surface, the geology of which is unknown, what will be the\r\nbest method of procedure and the principal points to which he should\r\ndirect his attention?\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the most useful record of a journey, whether intended\r\nfor publication or merely as a memorandum, is a sketch geological map\r\nof the route followed, with the dips and strikes of the rocks and\r\napproximate boundaries to the formations, supplemented by notes and\r\nsketch-sections. Where, as is commonly the case in mountain-chains, and\r\nfrequently in less elevated portions of the country, the rocks are much\r\ndisturbed, and especially if the number of systems exposed is large and\r\nthe changes frequent, no traveller can expect to do more than gain a\r\nvery rough and general idea of the succession of beds in detail, and of\r\nthe structure; but by making excursions in various directions, whenever\r\na halt is practicable, by searching for fossils as a guide to the age\r\nand for the identification of beds with each other, and by carefully\r\nnoting the general dip and strike of the more conspicuous beds, it is\r\noften possible, especially if an opportunity occurs of retracing the road\r\nfollowed, or of traversing a parallel route, to make out the structure\r\nof a country that at first appears hopelessly intricate. Dense forest is\r\nperhaps the worst obstacle to geological exploration; snow is another,\r\nthough not quite so serious a disadvantage. It is always a good plan to\r\nclimb commanding peaks; the general direction of beds, obscure from the\r\nlower ground, not unfrequently becomes much clearer when they are seen\r\nfrom above.\r\n\r\nIn level and undulating regions, on the other hand, it frequently happens\r\nthat enormous tracts of country are occupied by the same formation,\r\nand if the rocks are soft, and especially if they are horizontal, or\r\nnearly so, little, if any, rock is to be seen in place. In this case\r\nwater-courses should be searched for sections, and the pebbles found in\r\nthe stream-beds examined, care being taken not to mistake transported\r\npebbles derived from overlying alluvium or drift for fragments of the\r\nunderlying rock. Where the same formation prevails over large tracts, it\r\nis usually easy, by examining the stones brought down by a stream, to\r\nlearn whether any other beds occur. It is astonishing how even a small\r\noutcrop of hard rock at a remote spot in the area drained by a stream\r\nwill almost always yield a few fragments that can be detected by walking\r\ntwo or three hundred yards up the stream-bed and carefully examining the\r\npebbles.\r\n\r\nNot infrequently different rocks support different vegetation, and by\r\nnoting the forms that are peculiar, the constitution of hills at a\r\nconsiderable distance may be recognised. Thus some kinds of rock will be\r\nfound to support evergreen, others deciduous trees, others grass, whilst\r\na fourth kind may be distinguished by the poverty or want of vegetation.\r\nIt is not well to trust too much to such indications, but they may show\r\nwhich hills require examination and which do not. The form assumed by the\r\noutcrop of some hard beds is often characteristic, and may be recognised\r\nat a considerable distance.\r\n\r\nOne most important fact should never be forgotten; mineral character,\r\nwhether of sedimentary or volcanic rocks, is absolutely worthless as a\r\nguide to the age of beds occurring in distant countries. The traveller\r\nshould never be led to suppose, because a formation, whether sedimentary\r\nor volcanic, in a remote part of the world, is mineralogically and\r\nstructurally identical with another in Europe, or some country of which\r\nthe geology is well known, that the two are of contemporaneous origin.\r\nThe blunders that have been made from want of knowledge of this important\r\ncaution are innumerable.\r\n\r\nThere are a few points of geological interest well worthy of the\r\ninvestigation of those who traverse unexplored, or partially explored,\r\ntracts of the earth’s surface. Amongst these are the following:—\r\n\r\n_Mountain-Chains._—Few, if any, geologists now believe that mountains\r\nwere simply thrust up from below; all admit that, at least in the\r\nmajority of cases, where great crumpling of the strata has taken place,\r\nthere has been lateral movement of the earth’s crust. But the causes,\r\nextent and date, of the lateral movements are still, to a great degree,\r\nmatters of conjecture, and every additional series of observations\r\nbearing on the question is of importance. There are many mountain-chains\r\nof which very little is yet known. In every case good sections are\r\nrequired, drawn as nearly to scale as practicable, through the range\r\nfrom side to side, and including the rocks at each base. The nature and\r\ndistribution of all volcanic and crystalline rocks, both in the range and\r\nthroughout the neighbouring areas, are especially noteworthy, and also\r\nthe relations of the later beds, if any, on the flanks of the mountains,\r\nto those constituting the range itself. The derivation of the materials\r\nof the former from the latter, and the relative amount of disturbance\r\nshown by the two, and by the different members of each, will afford a\r\nclue to the date of upheaval; and two or more periods of movement may\r\nthus be determined, where intrusive igneous rocks, such as granite,\r\noccur, their relations to the surrounding rocks should be carefully\r\nnoted, and specimens at the contact of the two rocks collected. If\r\naltered sedimentary rocks are found these should be traced, if possible,\r\naway from the igneous rock until some indication of their age is obtained\r\nfrom included fossils.\r\n\r\nThe distinction between a contemporaneous lava flow and an intrusive\r\nsheet of igneous rock is not always at first sight apparent; if the\r\nlatter, it may pass from one bed to another or send tongues upwards\r\ninto the overlying strata. Search should be made in the beds overlying\r\nthe igneous rock for signs of alteration by heat. Thus limestone may be\r\nre-crystallised into marble, or shales altered into flinty hornstone.\r\n\r\n_Volcanoes and Volcanic Rocks._—It is almost needless to say that any\r\nadditional information on the distribution of volcanic vents, recent or\r\nextinct, is of interest. In the case of extinct vents, the geological\r\ndate of the last eruptions should be ascertained if practicable. This may\r\nsometimes be determined by finding organic remains or sedimentary beds of\r\nknown age interstratified with the ashes or lava-streams near the base of\r\nthe volcano.\r\n\r\n_Coasts._—The subject of the erosion of coasts is now fairly understood,\r\nand there is no doubt that the relative importance of this form of\r\ndenudation was greatly overrated by many geological writers, who took\r\ntheir ideas of geological denudation generally from the phenomena\r\nobserved in the islands, and on some of the coasts of Western Europe.\r\nStill, wherever cliffs occur, they afford good sections, and deserve\r\nexamination. One question will usually present itself to almost every\r\ngeological observer, and that is, whether any coast he may be landing\r\nupon affords evidence of elevation or depression. In the former case,\r\nbeds of rolled pebbles or of marine shells, similar to those now living\r\non the shore, may be found at some elevation above high-water mark.\r\nVery often the commonest molluscs in raised beds are the kinds occurring\r\nin estuaries, which are different from those inhabiting an open coast.\r\nCaution is necessary, however, that heaps of shells made by man, or\r\nisolated specimens transported by animals (birds or hermit-crabs), or\r\nby the wind, be not mistaken for evidence of raised beds.[5] If the\r\nshore is steep, terraces on the hillsides may mark the levels at which\r\nthe sea remained in past times, but some care is necessary not to\r\nmistake outcrops of hard beds for terraces. If dead shells of species\r\nof mollusca, only living in salt-water estuaries, are found in places\r\nnow beyond the influence of the tide, it is a reasonable inference that\r\nelevation has taken place.\r\n\r\nThe evidence of depression, on the other hand, unless there are buildings\r\nor trees partly sunk in the water, is much less readily obtained, and\r\nneither trees nor buildings are available as evidence, unless the\r\ndepression is of comparatively recent date. The best proof is the form\r\nof the coast. If deep inlets of moderate breadth occur, with numerous\r\nbranches, a little examination will frequently show whether such inlets\r\nare valleys of subaërial erosion, as they not unfrequently are, that\r\nhave been depressed below the sea. A good and familiar example of such\r\na depressed valley is to be found at Milford Haven in South Wales. In\r\nhigher latitudes, the coast should be examined for signs of the action of\r\nsea ice, and stones should be collected from icebergs which have drifted\r\nfrom outside the accessible area; the shape of these stones and the\r\nproportion of those having only one smoothed side should be noted.\r\n\r\n_Rivers and River-Plains._—At the present time a question of much\r\ninterest is the antiquity of existing land-areas, and some light may be\r\nthrown upon this, if the relations of existing river-basins to those of\r\npast times can be determined. If a stream cuts its way through a high\r\nrange, it is probable that the stream is of greater antiquity than the\r\nrange, and either once ran at an elevation higher than the crest of the\r\nridge now traversed, or else has cut its way through the range gradually\r\nduring the slow elevation of the latter. Where a river traverses a great\r\nalluvial plain, it may fairly be inferred that a long time has been\r\noccupied in the accumulation of the deposits to form the plain; but\r\nit remains to be seen whether those deposits are not partly marine or\r\nlacustrine. If upheaval has taken place over any portion of the plain, or\r\nif the river has cut its bed deeper, sections may be exposed, and these\r\nshould always be examined for fossil remains. Bones of extinct animals\r\nare not unfrequently found in such deposits.[6]\r\n\r\n_Lakes and Tarns._—The mode of origin of lakes is always a subject of\r\nconsiderable geological interest, and any evidence which bears on the\r\norigin of a particular lake should be carefully noted. Lakes may be\r\ndivided broadly into two classes: (1) Rock basins, (2) impounded hollows.\r\nLakes of the latter class may, as a rule, be readily recognised and\r\naccounted for. The material forming the barrier may be due to a moraine,\r\nscrees, or a landslip, or may result from the presence of a glacier\r\nin the main valley damming back the drainage of a lateral tributary.\r\nWhen lakes occur near the summit of a pass, they may often be traced to\r\ndeposition of delta material on the floor of the valley brought down by\r\na tributary stream. In this case, the inability of the stream to remove\r\nthe material may often be traced to the abstraction of the head waters\r\nof the valley by the encroachment of the stream on the other side of the\r\nwatershed. Rock basins, on the other hand, are frequently difficult to\r\naccount for. They may occupy volcanic craters, or lie in areas of special\r\ndepression (earthquake districts), or synclinal folds. They may be due\r\nto upheaval of old valley systems, causing reversal of drainage, or to\r\nsubsidence at the upper end of a valley.\r\n\r\nIn special cases they may be due to the solution of soluble rock\r\n(rock-salt, gypsum, limestone, or dolomite). Many not otherwise\r\nexplicable have been attributed to ice erosion during glacial periods,\r\nand it is still a moot point how far these lakes are due to partial\r\nchanges in the elevation of the country, some observers having adopted,\r\nwhile many others dispute, the views of the late Sir A. Ramsay, who\r\nbelieved all these hollows to have been scooped out by ice moving over\r\nthe surface in the form of a glacier or an ice-sheet. The origin of any\r\nlake met with should, if possible, be investigated and assigned to one of\r\nthese causes.\r\n\r\n_Evidence of Glacial Action._—Closely connected with the subject of lakes\r\nis that of glacial evidence generally. There is probably no geological\r\nquestion which has produced more speculation of late years than the\r\ninquiry into the traces of a comparatively recent cold period in the\r\nearth’s history, and the former occurrence of similar glacial epochs at\r\nregular or irregular intervals of geological time.\r\n\r\nThe evidence of the last glacial epoch may be traced in two ways—by the\r\nform of the surface, which has been modified by the action of ice, and\r\nby changes that have taken place in the fauna and flora of the country\r\nin consequence of the alteration in the climate. The effects of an\r\nice-sheet, like that now occurring in Greenland, if such formerly existed\r\nin comparatively low latitudes, must have been to round off, score and\r\npolish the rocks of the country in a peculiar manner, easily recognised\r\nby those familiar with glaciated areas. Care should be taken that the\r\npeculiar scoring and grooving of rock surfaces produced by the action of\r\nsand transported by the wind be not mistaken for glacial evidence. Cases\r\nalso occur where movement among a mass of unconsolidated conglomerate\r\nor scree material has produced striation of the pebbles; in this case,\r\nhowever, careful observation will disclose a similar striation in the\r\nmaterial of the matrix as well. Glaciers, properly so called, are\r\nconfined to hilly or mountainous countries, and the valleys formerly\r\noccupied by them retain more or less the form of the letter U instead of\r\ntaking the shape of the letter V, as they do when they have been cut out\r\nby running water. The sides of the valley, when modified by a glacier,\r\nhave a tendency to assume the form of slopes unbroken by ravines, and\r\nwith all ridges planed away or rounded, whilst in ordinary valleys of\r\nerosion by water, the sides consist of a series of side valleys or\r\nravines, divided from each other by sharp ridges running down to the\r\nmain valley. Large and small masses of rock, preserving to a considerable\r\nextent an angular form, but frequently polished and grooved by being\r\nground against the sides or bottom of the valley, are carried down by the\r\nice, and either left behind, perched up high on the slopes of the valley,\r\nor accumulated in a vast heap or bank, known as a terminal moraine, at\r\nthe spot where the ice has terminated, or as lateral moraines on the\r\nsides of the valley. The nature of the rock will usually show whether the\r\nfragments on the side of a hill or at the bottom of a valley are derived\r\nfrom the higher parts of the drainage area, or whether they have merely\r\nfallen down from the neighbouring slopes. In the latter case, they may be\r\ndue to landslips; in the former, their shape and the erosion they have\r\nundergone will aid in showing whether they have been transported by water\r\nor ice.\r\n\r\nThe surfaces that have been modified by earlier glacial epochs must in\r\ngeneral have been long since removed by other denuding agencies. The\r\nmost important evidence of former ice action consists in the occurrence,\r\nembedded in fine sediment, of large boulders, occasionally preserving\r\nmarks of polish and striation, and usually, though not always, angular.\r\nAccumulations of this kind afford evidence of transport by two different\r\nagencies, water, which has brought the silt, and ice, which has carried\r\nthe boulders. If the water had been in rapid movement, and thus capable\r\nof moving the boulders, it would have carried away fine silt or sand,\r\ninstead of depositing it. Evidence of ice action has thus been traced\r\nequally in the boulder clay of North-Western Europe, and in the Palæozoic\r\nboulder beds of India, South Africa, and Australia, and probably of South\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nIt is well to search in all mountain ranges for traces of glacial action.\r\nIn many mountain chains, even in comparatively low latitudes, proofs have\r\nbeen found of the existence of glaciers, at a much lower level than at\r\npresent, dating from a comparatively recent geological period, whilst\r\nin other mountain regions none have been recognised. The question also\r\nwhether glacial action has been contemporaneous in the two hemispheres\r\nis of the greatest importance, and the evidence hitherto adduced is of a\r\nvery conflicting character.\r\n\r\n_Deserts._—The great sandy or salt plains, with a more or less barren\r\nsurface, that occupy a large area in the interior of several continents,\r\nhave only of late years received due attention from geologists. A great\r\nthickness of deposits must occur in many of these vast, nearly level,\r\ntracts, for the underlying rocks are often completely concealed over\r\nimmense areas. The investigation of the deposits is frequently a matter\r\nof great difficulty for want of sections; but, where practicable, a\r\ncareful examination should be made, and exact descriptions of the\r\nformations exposed recorded. Some, at all events, of these beds appear\r\nto be entirely deposited from the air, and consist of the decomposed\r\nsurfaces of rocks and the sand and silt from stream deposits, carried up\r\nby wind and then redeposited on the surface of the country. Such deposits\r\nare very fine, formed of well-rounded grains, and, as a rule, destitute\r\nof stratification. The geologist who has especially described these\r\nformations, Baron F. von Richthofen, in his work on China, attributes\r\nto the loess of the Rhine and Danube valleys a similar origin. It is\r\nusual to find beds due to water-action, rain-wash and stream-deposits,\r\ninterstratified with the subaërial accumulations. Further observations on\r\nthese formations are desirable. The occurrence of blown sands, the origin\r\nof these accumulations, and the peculiar ridges they assume, usually at\r\nright angles, but in some remarkable cases parallel to the prevailing\r\nwinds, are questions deserving of additional elucidation.\r\n\r\n_Early History of Man in Tropical Climates._—Very little has been\r\ndiscovered as to the races of men formerly inhabiting tropical regions.\r\nIt is evident that a race unacquainted with fire could only have existed\r\nin a country where suitable food was procurable throughout the year, and\r\nthis must have been in a region possessing a climate like that found\r\nin parts of the tropics at the present day. It is possible that an\r\ninvestigation of the cave deposits in the tropics may throw some light\r\non this subject. “Kitchen middens,” as they are termed—the mounds that\r\nhave once been the refuse heaps of human habitations—are also worthy of\r\ncareful examination.\r\n\r\n_Permanence of Ocean-Basins._—Within the last few years some geologists\r\nhave adopted the theory that all the deep-sea area has been the same\r\nfrom the earliest geological times, and that the distinction between the\r\ndepressions occupied by the oceans and the remaining undepressed portion\r\nof the earth’s crust, constituting the continents and the shallow seas\r\naround their coasts, is permanent. This view is very far from being\r\nuniversally or even generally accepted amongst geologists, although\r\nmany who hesitate to accept the theory as a whole admit that parts of\r\nthe oceans may have been depressions since the earth’s crust was first\r\nconsolidated.\r\n\r\nThe argument on both sides depends upon theories to which travellers can\r\ncontribute but little except by observations on the geology, fauna, and\r\nflora of oceanic islands, and by the investigation of coral-reefs and\r\nespecially of atolls. In ranges of hills or mountains near the coast\r\nboth of continents and islands and in all tracts where evidence of\r\nrecent elevation exists, search should be made for deep-sea deposits.\r\nThese are fine calcareous or argillaceous beds, often containing small\r\nForaminifera or Radiolaria, which, however, are generally extremely\r\nminute, and require microscopical examination for detection. If any beds\r\nof consolidated calcareous or siliceous ooze or especially if red or\r\ngray clay (in older rocks, slate, or even quartzite) be found associated\r\nwith pelagic deposits, such as coral limestone, a few small fragments of\r\nthe beds should always be brought away for examination, and any distinct\r\nfossil remains found in such beds, for instance echinoderms (sea-urchins\r\nor star-fishes) or sharks’ teeth, should be carefully preserved with some\r\nof the matrix. Deep-sea deposits have recently been discovered in several\r\nparts of the world, for instance, the West Indies, the Solomon Islands,\r\nthe islands of Torres Straits and Southern Australia, as well as in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n_Atolls or Coral-Islands._—Each of the remarkable coral-islands of the\r\nPacific and Indian oceans consists usually of an irregular ring, part or\r\nthe whole of which is a few feet above the sea, and which encircles an\r\ninner lagoon of no great depth. The outer margin of the reef around each\r\nisland slopes rapidly, sometimes precipitately, to a depth of, usually,\r\nseveral hundred fathoms. Darwin, taking these facts into consideration,\r\ntogether with the circumstance that no coral-reefs are known to be formed\r\nat a greater depth than about 15 to 20 fathoms (90 to 120 feet), showed\r\nthat all the facts of the case could be explained by the theory that\r\ncoral-islands were formed in areas of subsidence. This view was generally\r\naccepted until Prof. A. Agassiz, Sir John Murray, and other writers\r\nbrought forward evidence in favour of coral-islands being founded on\r\nshoals that may be areas of elevation.\r\n\r\nMuch light has been thrown on this subject by recent exploration. Two\r\ninstances in especial may be mentioned. The examination of Christmas\r\nIsland in the Indian Ocean, South of Sumatra, by Mr. Andrews, has shown\r\nit to be a raised atoll, founded on a volcanic base, whilst, on the other\r\nhand, borings on the atoll of Funafuti, one of the Marshall Islands in\r\nthe Western Pacific, carried to a depth of over 1000 feet on the ring\r\nitself, and to 245 feet below sea-level in the middle of the lagoon, have\r\nyielded results which, in the opinion of the geologists engaged, Prof.\r\nSollas and Prof. Edgeworth David, completely confirm Darwin’s theory.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that atolls originate in more than one way, some being\r\nformed in rising or stationary tracts, others in areas of depression.\r\nThe important question, from a geographical point of view, is not so\r\nmuch how isolated atolls were formed as whether the great tracts in the\r\nPacific and Indian oceans in which no islands occur except atolls, for\r\ninstance, the Marshall, Gilbert and Low archipelagoes in the former, and\r\nthe Laccadives and Maldives in the latter, have been areas of extensive\r\nsubsidence during the later geological periods. Further evidence on this\r\nquestion may perhaps in time be furnished by additional borings, for\r\none of which an island of the Maldive group would furnish an excellent\r\nlocality, since there is in this case independent evidence to indicate\r\nthat the archipelago occupies part of a sunken tract. Meantime any\r\nadditional details would be useful, such as careful soundings around\r\nthose atolls which have not been fully surveyed, so as to give an\r\naccurate profile of the sea-bottom in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORANDUM ON GLACIER OBSERVATIONS.\r\n\r\nRevised by ALAN G. OGILVIE.\r\n\r\nThe recent movements of glaciers may be noted by the following signs:—\r\n\r\nWhen the ice is advancing, the glaciers generally have a more convex\r\noutline, the icefalls are more broken into towers and spires, and piles\r\nof fresh rubbish are found shot over the grass of the lower moraines.\r\nMoraines which have been comparatively recently deposited by advancing\r\nice are disturbed, show cracks, and are obviously being pushed forward or\r\naside by the glacier. There is a tendency for the glacier to terminate in\r\na vertical front, or “Chinese wall,” as distinguished from the sloping\r\nsnout of a stationary or retreating glacier, owing to the more rapid\r\nadvance of the upper layers. If the advance is rapid the overhanging\r\nlayers will fall, and an ice talus will collect in front. An inspection\r\nof the ice will often disclose horizontal lines of sheering which in a\r\nside view are seen to rise towards the terminal wall. Search should be\r\nmade along these sheer planes for included moraine material, and any\r\nproofs of elevation of this material noted.\r\n\r\nWhen the ice is in retreat it terminates in a gently sloping snout. The\r\nmarks of its further recent extension are seen fringing the glacier both\r\nat the end and sides in their lower portions, the glacier fails to fill\r\nits former bed, and bare stony tracts, often interspersed with pools or\r\nlakelets, lie between the end of the glacier and the mounds of recent\r\nterminal moraines.\r\n\r\nWhere a glacier has retreated to any considerable extent, careful\r\nobservations of the form of its bed are of value. What is the nature of\r\nthe rock surfaces exposed—convex or concave; are they rubbed smooth on\r\ntheir leesides; how far have the contours of the cliffs or slopes, or\r\nthe sides of any gorge, been modified where they have been subjected to\r\nice-friction? Is there any evidence that the ice has flowed over large\r\nboulders, or loose soils, such as gravel, without disturbing them? How\r\nhas it affected rocks of different hardness, for instance, veins of\r\nquartz in a less hard rock? Generally, do the appearances indicate that\r\nthe glacier has excavated, or only abraded and polished its bed; that\r\nit has scooped out new rock-basins, or only cleaned out, scratched, and\r\npreserved from filling-up by alluvial deposits or earthslips, existing\r\nbasins? What is the general character of the valley bottom and the slopes\r\nabove and below the most conspicuous ancient moraines?\r\n\r\nWith a view to ascertaining the oscillations in length of a glacier,\r\nthe traveller or surveyor should, if possible, mark on the ground the\r\nposition of the end of the glacier at the time of his visit, so that\r\nthe next visitor will be able to measure the movement that has taken\r\nplace since his predecessor’s visit. Leaving out of question elaborate\r\ntrigonometrical methods, such, for instance, as have been carried out on\r\nthe Rhone Glacier in Switzerland, the following means may be adopted for\r\nrecording the position of the glacier front with considerable accuracy.\r\nPaint some signs on large boulders, not too far from the end of the\r\nglacier, and measure their distance from it by a tape (Richter’s system),\r\nor build a low wall of stones of a few yards in length, and, say 15 to\r\n20 inches in height, some distance from the ice-end, and measure this\r\ndistance (Gosset’s system). It is to be recommended that the stones of\r\nthese walls should also be painted. In either case the date and distance\r\nshould be painted on the stones. If the traveller himself returns after\r\nsome interval—even after only two or three weeks—he will be able to\r\njudge of the movement of the glacier, and he will have laid down a basis\r\nfor further observations by future travellers. A plane-table sketch on\r\na fairly large scale with contours or form lines of the ice front and\r\nits immediate vicinity is of the greatest value, as it records not only\r\nthe position but also the form of the glacier. The sketch should, of\r\ncourse, show the position of the painted boulders or other fixed points\r\nnear the ice. To ascertain the recent retreat of a glacier, measure the\r\ndistance from the ice front to the most advanced terminal moraine, where\r\nvegetation first shows itself. The bare ground recently left by glaciers\r\nis easily recognisable. The diminution of volume is best measured by\r\nascertaining the height of bare soil left on the sides of the lateral\r\nmoraines in the portion of the glacier within the zone of vegetation. All\r\nphotographic representations of the glacier end, and of the ground which\r\nhas been freed from the glacier ice, are of great value. Those will be of\r\nmost service that show the position of the glacier-snout with relation\r\nto some conspicuous rock or other feature in the local scenery. Each\r\nphotograph should be dated, and the bearings and distance of the camera\r\nwith reference to any such feature accurately noted.\r\n\r\nNeighbouring glaciers often furnish very different results as regards\r\nadvance or retreat, owing to the fact that steep glaciers anticipate in\r\ntheir oscillations those the beds of which are less inclined.\r\n\r\nOne of the results most to be desired is an exact knowledge of the dates:\r\n\r\n    I. Of the maximum extension of the ice.\r\n   II. Of the commencement of retreat.\r\n  III. Of the minimum.\r\n   IV. Of the commencement of fresh increase.\r\n\r\nand even information giving approximate dates—say, to within a decade,\r\nmay prove to be of value.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with a mountain group, therefore, the traveller should note\r\nwhere he can get the information as to the past, the date of the\r\ncommencement of the actual movement of _each glacier_, and in all cases\r\nwhether the ice is in advance, or retreat, or stationary. Of course the\r\nrate of forward movement, or velocity of the ice, and the oscillations in\r\nthe extension of the ice must be kept carefully distinct. Observations\r\nshould also be made on the presence of blue bands, and their relation to\r\nthe lines of stratification in the névé noted.\r\n\r\nShould time and circumstances permit, a series of observations of the\r\nvelocity of the ice is of value. These may be made after Tyndall’s\r\nmethod, by planting a line of sticks across the glacier, or by painting\r\nmarks on boulders, the position of which relatively to ascertained points\r\non the mountain-side has been accurately fixed. The size of the glacier\r\nthat is, the area of its basin and its length, also the slope of its\r\nbed above, as well as at the point measured, should be noted. The rate\r\nof movement of the ice appears to be connected both with the volume of\r\nthe glacier and the inclination of its bed, and is considerably affected\r\nby temperature. Thus a rise in temperature may even be accompanied by a\r\ntemporary advance, but in this case a sagging will take place higher in\r\nthe névé, producing a concave cross-section, showing that the advance is\r\nnot due to increased snowfall, but to a decrease in the viscosity of the\r\nice.\r\n\r\nThe advance or retreat of a glacier are not the only factors to take into\r\naccount in estimating the decrease or diminution of the volume of ice.\r\nThe highest level of the transverse convexity of the glacier at various\r\npoints in its course should also be noted. If the glacier is bounded\r\nlaterally by rocky walls, marks may conveniently be painted on these,\r\nopposite one another. The vertical height of the marks above the ice at\r\nthe sides should be noted, and the date of the observation recorded.\r\n\r\nA society, entitled the Commission Internationale des Glaciers, has\r\nbeen formed to promote the study of glacial movements and other points\r\nof interest and importance. Their reports from their inception to 1905\r\nwere published in the ‘Archives des Sciences,’ Geneva, the journal of\r\nthe Swiss Alpine Club, and from 1906 to 1913 in the ‘Zeitschrift für\r\nGletscherkunde,’ Berlin. A summary of the reports in English appeared\r\nthroughout these years in the ‘Journal of Geology,’ Washington. The\r\nEuropean War has disorganised this international society, but steps are\r\nbeing taken to establish some organisation to replace it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nNATURAL HISTORY.[7]\r\n\r\n_By the late H. W. BATES, F.R.S._\r\n\r\nRevised by W. R. OGILVIE-GRANT, _British Museum (Natural History)_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the present state of Biological Science, travellers who intend to\r\ndevote themselves specially to the zoological or botanical investigation\r\nof new or little-known countries, require to be trained for the work\r\nbeforehand, and are consequently well-informed as to methods and\r\nappliances. It is not for them that these ‘Hints’ are drawn up, but for\r\ngeneral travellers and explorers, who, whilst engaged chiefly in survey,\r\nwish to know how best to profit by their opportunities of benefiting\r\nscience by collecting examples of new or rare species, and how to\r\npreserve and safely transmit their specimens. The observations refer only\r\nto explorations by land.\r\n\r\n_Outfit_[8]—\r\n\r\n    A magazine sporting rifle, either Mannlicher ·256, or\r\n    Lee-Enfield ·303, and ammunition (solid and soft-nosed, split\r\n    or hollow-point bullets).\r\n\r\n    Double-barrel 12-bore gun—for choice a Keeper’s hammerless\r\n    non-ejector gun and ammunition (Nos. 3 and 5 shot).[9]\r\n\r\n    Double-barrel ·410 hammer-gun and ammunition (Nos. 8, 10 and 12\r\n    shot).\r\n\r\n    Cartridges with a full charge of powder and No. 8 shot will\r\n    kill larger birds at a considerable distance; those with Nos.\r\n    10 and 12 shot are specially loaded for collecting smaller\r\n    birds at closer quarters, and may be used at distances of from\r\n    fifteen to twenty-five yards without damaging the specimens.\r\n    The loads are: ⅜ oz. No. 12 shot, ¾ dr. black powder, or 9\r\n    grains Schultz; ½ oz. No. 10 shot, ¾ dr. black powder, or 9\r\n    grains Schultz. In damp climates black powder will be found\r\n    more reliable. If shot larger than No. 8 is used with this\r\n    gun, the pattern is erratic and the result uncertain. Messrs.\r\n    Cogswell and Harrison, 226 Strand, W.C., have had considerable\r\n    experience in loading cartridges for these guns, and their Nos.\r\n    10 and 12 shot is even and carefully screened.\r\n\r\n    No. 1 saloon pistol and ammunition (turned-over caps with dust\r\n    shot). This pistol will be found of great value for collecting\r\n    small birds at very close quarters in thick cover, or the more\r\n    active lizards. It can be easily carried in a holster on a\r\n    belt, to which is also attached a small pouch for ammunition.\r\n    Small brass turned-over caps, loaded with a pinch of dust-shot,\r\n    can be had of Messrs.

Pitfall-traps made by sinking earthenware jars\r\n    flush with the ground are also useful.\r\n\r\n    Several air-tight zinc-lined collecting boxes, fitted with\r\n    light wooden trays. These are made by Messrs.

Price 1s. 6d._\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn humid tropical countries, where the ubiquitous ants are likely to\r\ndestroy specimens before they are ready to be packed away, drying-cages,\r\nsuspended from the roof of a hut or tent, are absolutely necessary.\r\nThese can be readily made from old packing-cases, but a few square feet\r\nof wire gauze must be provided for the back and front of the cages, and\r\nthe cord by which they are suspended must be threaded through a small\r\ncalibash containing oil, or, better still, naphthaline, to prevent ants\r\nfrom descending from the roof. The cages may be so arranged as to be\r\ntaken to pieces and put together again readily; one, for birds, should\r\nbe about 2 feet 6 inches long by 1 foot 6 inches high and 1 foot broad;\r\nthe other, for insects and other small specimens, may be about one-third\r\nless. They should have folding doors in front, with panels of wire gauze,\r\nand the backs wholly of the latter material; the sides fitted with racks\r\nto hold six or eight plain shelves, which in the smaller cage should be\r\ncovered with cork, or any soft wood that can be obtained in tropical\r\ncountries. A strong ring fixed in the top of the cage, with a cord having\r\na hook attached at the end by which to hang it in an airy place, will\r\nkeep the contained specimens out of harm’s way until they are quite dry,\r\nwhen they may be stowed away in suitable close-fitting boxes. An even\r\nsimpler and perfectly effective plan is to take a number of pieces of\r\nstout wire each about 18 inches long, bend each end into a loop, and\r\nround the middle solder a funnel-shaped piece of tin to contain powdered\r\ncandle-naphthaline. The upper loop of each wire can be secured with\r\nstring to a rafter, and between the lower loops flat boards, or a series\r\nof boards, can be suspended on which skins may be placed to dry. This\r\nmethod has been proved to be safe, no ants ever venturing to cross the\r\nnaphthaline.\r\n\r\nA few yards of india-rubber waterproof sheeting may be found useful as a\r\ntemporary covering to collections in wet weather or in crossing rivers.\r\n\r\nTo those who have had little or no experience in field-collecting it may\r\nbe useful to give some idea of the impedimenta considered absolutely\r\nessential for an ordinary day’s work when it is desired to collect, as\r\nfar as possible, in all branches of zoology, and the most convenient\r\nmeans of disposing of such. The collector should be accompanied, if\r\npossible, by two intelligent natives to act as bearers, who may, with\r\npatience, be developed into useful assistant-collectors.\r\n\r\nA 12-bore gun or rifle, according to circumstances, with ammunition, to\r\nbe carried by the first bearer.\r\n\r\nA ·410 collecting gun and twenty-five cartridges, including a few\r\ncartridges with full loads of 8 shot: the cartridges to be carried by\r\nself, the gun, when not in use, to be carried by the second bearer. The\r\n10 shot and 12 shot ·410 cartridges should be carried in the two lower\r\nwaistcoat pockets, where they are easily accessible, and the few 8 shot\r\ncartridges in some other pocket.\r\n\r\nSaloon pistol in holster with pouch for carrying ammunition on belt,\r\nstrapped round the waist, so that it can be easily and quickly made use\r\nof.\r\n\r\nA butterfly-net carried by self, or by the second bearer if not in use.\r\n\r\nLarge oval zinc pocket-box lined with cork carpet, containing a stock of\r\npins, both large and small, stuck in one side of the cork carpet ready\r\nfor use; to be carried in the right-hand side-pocket of the coat.\r\n\r\nEntomological forceps, pointed forceps, and larger forceps for picking up\r\nscorpions, large spiders, etc., and entomological killing-bottle; to be\r\ncarried in the left-hand side-pocket of the coat.\r\n\r\nTwo larger-sized corked glass tubes half-full of spirits and\r\na camel’s-hair brush to be carried in the right and left top\r\nwaistcoat-pockets, for collecting small spiders, etc. It is difficult to\r\npick up the swift-running ground-haunting species without injury, but,\r\nby dipping the brush in spirits and placing it on them, they are at once\r\nstupefied, and may then be easily transferred to the tube.\r\n\r\nThe spirit is also required for saturating the small plug of cotton-wool\r\nto be pushed down the throat of each bird as soon as it has been killed;\r\nthe gape should then be plugged with dry cotton. Specimens thus prepared\r\nmay be carried, even in a hot climate, for several hours without\r\ndeteriorating.\r\n\r\nA game bag carried by the second bearer, with a large supply of paper for\r\nwrapping up birds when shot.\r\n\r\nSeveral sets of glass-top pill-boxes carried in the ‘hare’-pocket, or in\r\none of the pockets of the game-bag, to which they can be transferred when\r\nfilled.\r\n\r\nA pickle pot in Willesden canvas or basket-work cover with handle,\r\nhalf filled with spirits, for collecting small snakes, lizards, frogs,\r\nscorpions, etc.; to be carried by the first bearer, who should be\r\ninstructed how to hunt for reptiles, etc.\r\n\r\nIf possible, a beetle-killing bottle should be added to the above\r\nimpedimenta, and may be carried in the left-hand breast-pocket of the\r\ncoat.\r\n\r\nA Norfolk coat is a most useful article of clothing, and should be\r\nprovided with a deep ‘hare’ pocket running round the skirt and divided in\r\nthe middle.\r\n\r\nAfter a very short time the collector will be able to find any article he\r\nmay require by instinct, and without loss of time. To have a pocket for\r\neach article, and to know where it is, saves an infinity of trouble.\r\n\r\nAt daylight the traps should be visited, and any specimens to be\r\npreserved should at once be sent back into camp.\r\n\r\nCollecting should always, if possible, be vigorously prosecuted during\r\nthe early morning hours, when birds, etc., are feeding, and are much more\r\neasily procured.\r\n\r\nWhen butterflies and thick-bodied moths are placed in the killing-bottle,\r\ncare should be taken to see that they die with their wings turned the\r\n‘right way,’ _i.e._, with the underside outermost. Those which die with\r\nthe upper side outermost should be at once reversed with the aid of a\r\npin or the sharp-pointed forceps, and then replaced in the bottle. If\r\nnot attended to at once they become rigid, and the wings get rubbed and\r\nspoilt before they are quite dead.\r\n\r\n_Where and what to collect._—The countries which are now the least known\r\nwith regard to their natural history are New Guinea and some of the large\r\nislands to the east of it, East Sumatra, the highlands of Mindanao and\r\nother Philippine Islands, Formosa, Tibet, Indo-China, and other parts of\r\nCentral Asia, Equatorial Africa, and Central South America. A special\r\ninterest attaches to the indigenous products of oceanic islands, _i.e._,\r\nislands separated by a deep sea from any large tract of land. Those who\r\nhave opportunities could not fail to make interesting discoveries by\r\ncollecting specimens of the smaller animals (insects, molluscs, etc.,)\r\nand plants in these isolated localities. Both in continental countries\r\nand on islands the truly indigenous species will have to be sought for\r\non hills and in the remote parts, where they are more likely to have\r\nescaped extermination by settlers and the domestic animals introduced by\r\nthem. In most of the better-known countries the botany has been better\r\ninvestigated than the zoology, and in all these there still remains\r\nmuch to be done in ascertaining the exact station, and the range, both\r\nvertical and horizontal, of known species of animals and plants. This\r\nleads us to one point which cannot be too strongly insisted on, namely,\r\nthat some effective means should be adopted by the traveller to record\r\nthe _exact locality_ and _date_ of every specimen he collects.[12]\r\n\r\nA traveller may be puzzled, in the midst of the profusion of animal\r\nand vegetable forms which he sees around him, to know what to collect\r\nand what to leave. Books can be of little service to him on a journey,\r\nand he had better at once abandon all idea of encumbering himself with\r\nthem. A few days study at the principal museums before he starts on his\r\nvoyage may teach him a great deal, and the cultivation of a habit of\r\nclose observation and minute comparison of the specimens he obtains will\r\nteach him a great deal more. As a general rule all specimens which he\r\nmay meet with for the first time far in the interior should be preferred\r\nto those common near the civilised parts, and he should bear in mind\r\nthat the few handsome kinds which attract the attention of the natives,\r\nand are offered for sale to strangers, are almost sure to be of species\r\nwell known in European museums. He should strive to obtain as much\r\nvariety as possible, and not fill his boxes and jars with quantities of\r\nspecimens of one or a few species, but as some of the rarest and most\r\ninteresting species closely resemble others which may be more common, he\r\nshould avail himself of every opportunity of comparing the objects side\r\nby side. In most countries, as already remarked, the truly indigenous,\r\nand often the rarest, species are to be found only in the mountains\r\nat considerable elevations and in the primitive forests, the products\r\nof cultivated districts being nearly all widely distributed and well\r\nknown. In Botany a traveller, if obliged to restrict his collecting,\r\nmight confine himself to those plants which are remarkable for their\r\neconomic uses; always taking care to identify the flowers of the tree\r\nor shrub whose root, bark, leaves, wood, etc., are used by the natives,\r\nand to preserve a few specimens of them. But if he has the good fortune\r\nto ascend any high mountain not previously explored, he should make as\r\ncomplete a collection of the flowering plants as possible, at the higher\r\nelevations. The same may be said of insects found on mountains, where\r\nthey occur in great diversity—on the shady and cold sides rather than on\r\nthe sunny slopes—under stones, and about the roots of herbage, especially\r\nnear springs, on shrubs and low trees, and so forth; for upon a knowledge\r\nof the plants and insects of mountain ranges depend the solution of many\r\ncurious questions regarding the geographical distribution of forms over\r\nthe earth. In Reptiles, the smaller Batrachians (Frogs, Salamanders,\r\netc.) should not be neglected, especially the extremely numerous family\r\nof tree-frogs; the arboreal, or rock-haunting species of Lizards seen out\r\nof reach, and the swift-running forms that inhabit sandy plains may be\r\nsecured with a charge of dust-shot, the saloon pistol being especially\r\nhandy for this purpose. Snakes should be taken without injuring the head,\r\nwhich is the most important part of the body: a cleft stick may be used\r\nin securing them by the neck, or they may be shot, and on reaching camp\r\nplaced in the jars of spirits. As large a collection as possible should\r\nbe made of the smaller Fishes and Tortoises of lakes and rivers.\r\n\r\n_Mammals and Birds._[13]—An ordinary geographical expedition will hardly\r\nhave the means at its disposal for bringing home many specimens of the\r\nlarger animals, but many species in regions visited only by adventurous\r\nexplorers are still desiderata in the large museums of Europe; and\r\nadditional specimens of all genera of which there are numerous closely\r\nallied species (_e.g._, Rodents, Antelope, Deer, etc.), and of all the\r\nsmall nocturnal mammals would be welcome to zoologists. If only portions\r\ncan be obtained, skulls with horns attached are to be preferred. The\r\nsmaller birds shot on an excursion should be carried to camp in the game\r\nbag, folded in paper, the mouth, anus and any wounds being first plugged\r\nwith cotton-wool. In a hot climate when the birds have to be carried for\r\nsome distance before they are skinned, a plug of cotton-wool dipped in a\r\nweak solution of formaline or in spirits should be pushed down the gullet\r\ninto the stomach, before the mouth is plugged with dry cotton-wool. This\r\nprecaution will insure specimens remaining fresh for many hours.\r\n\r\nSmall dull-coloured birds are most likely to be new or interesting.\r\nImmediately after killing a small mammal or bird, make a note of the\r\ncolour of its eyes and soft parts, and, if time admits, of the dimensions\r\nof its trunk and limbs. Full directions for skinning will be found in the\r\nBritish Museum ‘Handbook,’ pp. 15-29. It should however be mentioned that\r\nin large-headed Parrots, Woodpeckers, Ducks, and some other birds, in\r\nwhich the skin of the head cannot be turned back, an incision has to be\r\nmade in the nape, through which the skull can be pushed and cleansed, the\r\nincision being afterwards closed by two or three stitches. In finishing\r\nthe skin of a bird the feet should be placed side by side, with the claws\r\nfolded and fastened together by means of a pin run transversely through\r\nthe soles. The protruding ends of the pin can afterwards be cut off close\r\nto the feet. This is Mr. W. Foster’s plan, and is by far the best and\r\nneatest method. When the skin is dry, it should be laid on its back in\r\none of the trays fitted into the zinc-lined collecting boxes, and secured\r\nby means of a couple of stout pins passed through the head at the base of\r\nthe lower mandible and through the root of the tail. By dovetailing the\r\nspecimens into one another, they can thus be packed with the least loss\r\nof space, and need not again be moved. They require no wrapping or paper,\r\nand are much more easily looked over to see that no insects have attacked\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n_Preserving Mammals, etc., in Alcohol._—When Mammals cannot be prepared\r\nas skins with skulls, according to the British Museum directions, they\r\nmay prove of service if preserved in spirits. Indeed, when a series of\r\nskins has been made, additional specimens may well be placed in spirits,\r\nwhile in the case of Bats half the individuals taken of any species\r\nshould be skinned and half put in spirits.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of the preservation of such spirit specimens, the late Dr.\r\nG. E. Dobson has published the following ‘Hints’:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL COLLECTING-CASE.]\r\n\r\nThe general collecting case should be made of strong block tin, or,\r\nbetter still, of copper, rectangular in form, about 2 feet × 1 foot ×\r\n1 foot 8 inches in height, having in the top a circular aperture from\r\n6 to 8 inches in diameter, closed by a well-fitting brass screw-cap,\r\nthe flange of which is made air-tight by a well-greased leather collar.\r\nThis should fit accurately into a similarly shaped box of inch boards,\r\nhaving a simple flat lid (not projecting beyond the sides), secured by\r\neight long screws, and provided with a strong iron handle. This case\r\nshould be filled with the strongest methylated spirits procurable (in\r\nforeign countries over-proof rum, brandy, or arrack will suit equally\r\nwell). If circumstances admit, two or more such cases should be taken,\r\nor four wide-mouthed earthenware jars placed in a square wooden case,\r\nseparated by light wooden partitions, and having their mouths closed by\r\nwell-fitting bungs tied down with bladder and string. On arrival at the\r\ncollecting station one of the jars should be half filled with spirits\r\nfrom the tin case. Into this each specimen, as it is obtained, having\r\nbeen slit along the side of the abdomen, should be put, and allowed to\r\nremain 24 hours before being transferred to the general collecting case.\r\nWhen the latter can hold no more the specimens should be removed one by\r\none and packed in the moist state in the other wide-mouthed jars, one\r\nabove the other, like herrings in a cask, each rolled in a piece of thin\r\ncotton cloth, in which a label, having the locality and date written\r\nin pencil, should be placed. When the jar has been thus filled to the\r\nmouth a glass or two of the strong spirits (kept in reserve) should be\r\npoured in so as to fill up the interstices, but not to appear on the\r\nsurface, which should be covered with a thick layer of cotton-wool. A\r\nfew drops of carbolic acid, if the spirit be weak, will greatly aid its\r\npreserving powers. The bung should then be replaced, secured round the\r\nmargin outside with a mixture of tallow and wax, and tied down securely\r\nwith bladder or skin, and the name of the collector and district written\r\nlegibly outside. The jar is now ready for transmission to any distance,\r\nfor specimens thus treated will keep good in the vapour alone of strong\r\nspirits for months. Other jars may be filled in like manner, and finally,\r\nthe general collecting case. Incisions should invariably be made in the\r\n_sides_ (not in the centre line) of all animals, so as to allow the\r\nspirits to enter, and no part of the intestines should be removed. In the\r\ncase of _Tortoises_ the opening may be made in the soft parts round the\r\nthighs; if this be not done, the body soon becomes distended with gases.\r\n_Frogs_ should always be first placed in weak spirits, and after being\r\nsoaked for one or two days, be removed to strong alcohol. _Crabs_ should\r\nbe rolled up alive in thin cotton-cloths, secured by thread tied round,\r\nand may then be readily killed by immersion in alcohol; if this be not\r\ndone they lose many of their limbs in their dying struggles.\r\n\r\n_Preparation of Skeletons of Animals._—In many cases it will be found\r\nimpossible to preserve the whole animal, especially if of large size, but\r\nit may advantageously be converted into a skeleton by attention to the\r\nfollowing directions of the late Sir W. H. Flower, F.R.S.\r\n\r\nIf the animal is of small size—say not larger than a Fox—take off the\r\nskin except from the feet below the wrist and ankle joints. If it is\r\nintended to preserve the skin as a zoological specimen as well as the\r\nskeleton, the bones of the feet should all be left in the skin; they can\r\nbe easily extracted afterwards, and will be preserved much more safely\r\nin their natural covering. Remove all the contents of the abdominal\r\nand thoracic cavities; also the larynx, gullet, and tongue. In doing\r\nthis be careful to leave attached to the base of the skull the chain of\r\nbones which supports the root of the tongue. These may either be left\r\nin connection with the skull, or cleaned separately and tied to the\r\nskeleton. Then clear away, with the aid of a knife, as much as possible\r\nof the flesh from the head, body, and limbs, without cutting or scraping\r\nthe bones, or separating them from each other. At any intervals that may\r\nbe necessary during this process it will be desirable, if practicable,\r\nto leave the body in water, so as to wash away as much of the blood as\r\npossible from the bones, and a few days’ soaking in water frequently\r\nchanged will be an advantage.\r\n\r\nThe body, with all the bones held in connection by their ligaments,\r\nshould then be hung up to dry in a place where there is a free current\r\nof air, and out of the way of attacks from animals of prey. Before they\r\nget hard the limbs may be folded by the side of the body in the most\r\nconvenient position, or they may be detached and placed inside the trunk.\r\n\r\nWhen thoroughly dry the skeletons may be packed in boxes with any\r\nconvenient light packing material between them. Each should be well\r\nwrapped in a separate piece of paper or canvas, as sometimes insects will\r\nattack the ligamentary structures and allow the bones to come apart.\r\n\r\nIf it can be avoided, skeletons should never be packed up so long as any\r\nmoisture remains in them, as otherwise decomposition will go on in the\r\nstill adhering soft parts, and cause an unpleasant smell.\r\n\r\nIf the animal is of larger size it will be most convenient to take it\r\npartially to pieces before or during the cleaning. The head may be\r\nseparated from the neck, the vertebral column divided into two or more\r\npieces, and the limbs detached from the trunk; but in no case should the\r\nsmall bones of the feet be separated from one another. The parts should\r\nthen be treated as above described, and all packed together in a canvas\r\nbag.\r\n\r\nIn the cetacea (porpoises, etc.), look for two small bones suspended in\r\nthe flesh, just below the vertebral column, at the junction of the lumbar\r\nand caudal regions (marked externally by the anal aperture). They are the\r\nonly rudiments of the pelvis, and should always be preserved with the\r\nskeleton.\r\n\r\nIf there is no opportunity of preserving and transporting entire\r\nskeletons, the skulls alone may be kept. They should be treated as above\r\ndescribed, picked nearly clean, the brain being scooped out through the\r\n_foramen magnum_, soaked for a few days in water, and dried.\r\n\r\nEvery specimen should be carefully labelled with the popular name of the\r\nanimal, if known, and at all events, with the sex, the _exact locality_\r\nat which it was procured, and the _date_.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of making entire skeletons, select, if possible, adult\r\nanimals; but the skulls of animals of all ages may be advantageously\r\ncollected.\r\n\r\nCollectors of skins should always leave the skull intact. It should be\r\ntaken out, labelled with a corresponding number to that on the skin, and\r\ndried with as much flesh on it as possible.\r\n\r\n_Reptiles and Fishes._—Full directions for preserving these will be\r\nfound in the British Museum ‘Handbook,’ pp. 33-47. The following ‘hints’\r\nwere prepared by the late Mr. Osbert Salvin, F.R.S., who collected these\r\nanimals most successfully in Guatemala:—\r\n\r\nAlmost any spirit will answer for this purpose, its fitness consisting\r\nin the amount of alcohol contained in it. In all cases it is best to\r\nprocure the strongest possible, as it is less bulky, and water can\r\nalways be obtained to reduce the strength to the requisite amount. When\r\nthe spirit sold retail by the natives is not sufficiently strong, by\r\nvisiting the distillery the traveller can often obtain the first runnings\r\n(the strongest) of the still, which will be stronger than he requires\r\nundiluted. The spirit used should be reduced to about 20° over proof, and\r\nthe traveller should always be provided with an alcoholometer. If this is\r\nnot at hand, a little practice will enable him to ascertain the strength\r\nof the spirit from the rapidity with which the bubbles break when rising\r\nto the surface of a small quantity shaken in a bottle. When the spirit\r\nhas been used this test is of no value. When reptiles or fish are first\r\nimmersed, it will be found that the spirit becomes rapidly weaker. Large\r\nspecimens absorb the alcohol very speedily. The rapidity with which this\r\nabsorption takes place should be carefully watched, and in warm climates\r\nthe liquid tested at least every twelve hours, and fresh spirit added\r\nto restore it to its original strength. In colder climates it is not\r\nrequisite to watch so closely, but practice will show what attention is\r\nnecessary. It will be found that absorption of alcohol will be about\r\nproportionate to the rate of decomposition. Spirit should not be used\r\ntoo strong, as its effect is to contract the outer surface, and close\r\nthe pores, thus preventing the alcohol from penetrating through to the\r\ninner parts of the specimen. _The principal point, then, is to watch that\r\nthe strength of the spirit does not get below a certain point while the\r\nspecimen is absorbing alcohol when first put in._ It will be found that\r\nafter a few days the spirit retains its strength: when this is the case,\r\nthe specimen will be perfectly preserved. Spirit should not be thrown\r\naway, no matter how often used, so long as the traveller has a reserve of\r\nsufficient strength to bring it back to its requisite strength.\r\n\r\nIn selecting specimens for immersion, regard must be paid to the means\r\nat the traveller’s disposal. Fishes up to 9 inches long may be placed\r\nin spirit, after a slit has been cut in the side of the belly to allow\r\nthe spirit to enter to the entrails. With larger specimens, it is better\r\nto pass a long knife outside the ribs, so as to separate the muscles on\r\neach side of the vertebræ. It is also as well to remove as much food from\r\nthe entrails as possible, taking care to leave all these in. The larger\r\nspecimens can be skinned, leaving, however, the intestines in, and simply\r\nremoving the flesh. Very large specimens preserved in this way absorb\r\nvery little spirit. All half-digested food should be removed from snakes\r\nand animals. In spite of these precautions, specimens will often appear\r\nto be decomposing; but, by more constant attention to restrengthening the\r\nspirit, they can, in most cases, be preserved.\r\n\r\nA case (copper is the best), with a top that can be unscrewed and\r\nrefixed easily, should always be carried as a receptacle. The opening\r\nshould be large enough to allow the hand to be inserted; this is to hold\r\nfreshly-caught specimens. When they have become preserved, they can all\r\nbe removed and soldered up in tin or zinc boxes. Zinc is best, as it does\r\nnot corrode so easily. The traveller will find it very convenient to\r\ntake lessons in soldering, and to be able to make his own boxes. If he\r\ntakes them ready-made, they had best be arranged so as to fit one into\r\nanother before they are filled. When moving about, all specimens should\r\nbe wrapped in calico or linen or other rags to prevent their rubbing\r\none against the other. This should also be done to the specimens in the\r\ncopper case when a move is necessary, as well as to those finally packed\r\nfor transmission to Europe. These last should have all the interstices\r\nbetween the specimens filled in with cotton-wool or rags. If a leak\r\nshould occur in a case, specimens thus packed will still be maintained\r\nmoist, and will keep some time without much injury. Proof spirit should\r\nbe used when the specimens are finally packed, but it is not necessary\r\nthat it should be fresh.\r\n\r\n_Land and Freshwater Mollusca._[14] Full instructions for collecting\r\nthese will be found in the ‘British Museum Handbook,’ pp. 113-115.\r\nLieut.-Col. H. H. Godwin-Austen, F.R.S., has contributed the following\r\nnotes on collecting these animals: Mollusca are always most abundant on\r\nlimestone rocks, and should be searched for under the larger stones\r\nlying about the ground, and under fallen trees and logs in the woods\r\nand forests. They may generally be found adhering to the surface of the\r\nstone or wood. Many species are often only 0.05 inch in length, so that\r\nvery close examination is necessary. In damp spots, generally in ravines\r\nwith a northerly aspect, the dead leaves when damp with dew in the early\r\nmorning may be turned over one by one, and the under surface examined\r\nfor minute species; larger species will be found very frequently on the\r\nsurface of the ground below the layer of decaying vegetable matter. Many\r\nmay also be secured by tearing off the bark of decaying trees. In the\r\ndrier parts of the country some species are only to be found among the\r\nroots of shrubs, at considerable depth; by digging these up and shaking\r\nthe earth on to paper, small shells may be found on close examination.\r\nAt a dry place like Aden, I should expect to find most of the living\r\nland-shells in such a habitat. Look well in limestone caves on the damp\r\nsurface of the rock; some forms hide themselves under a coating of earthy\r\nmatter. Search also on damp moss and rocks near waterfalls.\r\n\r\nSome species will be found high up on the bushes and trees. This is\r\nthe habit of certain African forms especially; not so in India. A very\r\ngood idea of the land-shells of a country may at first be obtained by\r\nthe examination of the beds of the streams, either along the highest\r\nflood-line, or in the fine sand and mud collected in the bed. Land-shells\r\nfound in such situations are usually old and bleached, but the living\r\nspecimens will not be far off.\r\n\r\nThe leaves and stems of water plants should be examined, and Confervæ\r\ntaken out of the water and well washed in a basin; in these, and in the\r\nmud of ponds and still rivers, many minute shells may be found.\r\n\r\nThe best way of preserving minute shells is to put them into glass tubes\r\nplugged with wool; it is better than cork. Capital collecting tubes can\r\nbe made out of the smaller sorts of bamboo and the large grasses. A\r\ncertain number of every species (at least a dozen) should be preserved\r\nin spirits for the sake of the anatomy. It is best to kill them first in\r\nwater and then put them into spirits; if this is not done they contract,\r\nso that it is impossible to form any idea of the form of the mantle and\r\nother parts, and they become so hard they are difficult to cut up.\r\n\r\nA good method of keeping the small shells and slugs, especially in\r\nspirits, is to put them with labels into small tubes plugged with wool,\r\nand then place the tubes in a large jar, capable of holding three or four\r\ndozen.\r\n\r\nOther small shells, ½ to ¾ of an inch in diameter, may be put into\r\npill-boxes at once, for in a dry climate they very soon dry up. The very\r\nlarge animals may be removed by boiling them in water, but when time does\r\nnot admit of attending to the cleaning of the shells, species, such as\r\nUnios, may be put into empty soup-tins and then filled up with dry sand.\r\n\r\nIt is very important to make a few notes on the colour of the animal,\r\nattaching a number for reference on the box or in the tube, and the\r\noperculum, when present, should always be preserved.\r\n\r\nWith respect to slugs, note the surface of the mantle, and always the\r\nform of the extremity of the foot, whether pointed or provided with a\r\nmucous pore; and again the lobes of the mantle. Preserve them in spirits\r\nas above. Drawings from the living animal are invaluable, and should be\r\nmade if possible. Very little is known of the Asiatic forms; they are of\r\nmuch interest, and have been very little collected.\r\n\r\n_Insects._—For the best means of preserving the various orders of insects\r\nthe traveller should consult the ‘British Museum Handbook,’ pp. 48-89.\r\n\r\n_Botanical Collecting._—Full instructions will be found in the ‘British\r\nMuseum Handbook,’ pp. 116-125.\r\n\r\nThe following instructions have been prepared by the late Mr. J. Ball,\r\nF.R.S.:—\r\n\r\nTo obtain good specimens of dried plants in a condition serviceable to\r\nscientific men, the following are the chief points to be observed:—\r\n\r\n1. _Selection of Specimens._—The object is to give as much information\r\nas possible respecting the plant which it is intended to collect. Small\r\nplants not exceeding 16 inches in height should be collected _entire with\r\nthe roots_. Slender plants of greater dimensions may be folded to the\r\nsame length, and may often be collected entire. Of larger plants, shrubs\r\nand trees, the object is to show as much as possible of the plant within\r\nthe limit of the size of your drying paper. As an universal rule, both\r\nthe flower and fruit (seed-vessel) should, if possible, be preserved.\r\nOf those plants whereon the male and female flowers grow separately,\r\nspecimens of both should, if possible, be collected.\r\n\r\n2. _Conveyance of Specimens to Camp or Station._—Tin boxes made for the\r\npurpose are generally used in Europe for carrying botanical specimens\r\nuntil they can be placed in the drying press. They answer sufficiently\r\nwell in cool weather, but in hot countries specimens are often partly\r\nwithered before they can be laid out; and a rough portfolio, into which\r\nthe plants can be put when (or soon after) they are gathered, is much to\r\nbe preferred.\r\n\r\nSuch a portfolio is easily prepared with two sheets of millboard\r\nconnected by an endless tape, so as to be easily slung over the shoulder;\r\nbetween these about thirty or forty sheets (60 to 80 folds) of thin soft\r\n(more or less bibulous) paper may be carried and kept in place by a strap\r\nor piece of twine. With two such portfolios a traveller can carry as many\r\nplants as it is possible to collect with advantage in a day. As soon\r\nas possible after being gathered, the specimens should be laid roughly\r\nbetween the sheets of paper: except in the case of delicate flowers,\r\nno special care is needed, and no harm comes of two or three being put\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n3. _The Drying Press._—The great object, both to secure good specimens\r\nand to save labour and weight of paper, is to get the plants dried\r\nquickly, and for this one of the first conditions is to lose as little\r\ntime as possible. When practicable, the specimens should always be put in\r\nthe press on the same day on which they are gathered. The press should\r\nbe made with two outer gratings of iron wire; the outer frame of strong\r\nwire, about a quarter of an inch in diameter—the size being that of the\r\npaper used. Between these the paper is laid. As to the choice of drying\r\npaper, the general rule is, that the coarser it is the better, provided\r\nit be quite or nearly quite free from size.\r\n\r\nTo enable the plants to dry quickly, the traveller should be provided\r\nwith light wooden gratings of the same size as the drying paper. I think\r\nthe size 18 inches × 12 inches is quite large enough. The iron wire outer\r\ngratings may with advantage be a quarter of an inch longer and broader to\r\nsave the edges of the wooden gratings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRATING SEEN FROM THE EDGE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRATING SEEN FROM ABOVE.]\r\n\r\nThese should be made of light laths fastened with a few nails (all the\r\nbetter if these are of copper), the interstices should be rather less\r\nthan three-quarters of an inch, at all events not more. Their use is\r\nto allow the air to circulate through the pile of plants that are being\r\ndried. One should be inserted at each interval of about two inches\r\n(counting the drying paper and the plants laid out for drying), and\r\nwhen this is done the parcel may with advantage be exposed to the sun\r\nor placed near a fire, as the case may be. In dry warm climates, the\r\nmajority of plants may be dried in the course of a few days, and will be\r\nfit to pack up, without any need of changing the drying paper in which\r\nthey were originally placed; but in damp weather, and in regard to plants\r\nof thick fleshy foliage, it is usually necessary to change the paper more\r\nthan once before the specimens are thoroughly dry.\r\n\r\nThe pile of paper, with plants between each five or six thicknesses of\r\npaper, and gratings at intervals of about two inches, should be squeezed\r\nbetween the outer (iron) gratings by means of two strong straps. Too much\r\npressure is not desirable. For a pile ten or twelve inches thick, the\r\nparcel may be pulled nearly as tight as a moderate man can do it; but in\r\nproportion as the thickness is less, the pressure should be moderated.\r\n\r\nPlants with fleshy leaves are very difficult to dry well. The best way\r\nis to dip them in quite boiling water for a minute or less, then to lay\r\nthem between a few sheets of drying paper with slight pressure, merely\r\nto remove the exterior moisture, and then place them (when externally\r\ndry) in the drying press. Plants collected in rain should be treated in a\r\nsimilar way to remove outer moisture before it is attempted to dry them.\r\n\r\n4. When once dry, plants may be packed away between paper of almost any\r\nkind. Old newspapers answer very well. The only precaution needed is to\r\npreserve them from insects.\r\n\r\nThe chief trouble in collecting plants is to get the paper already used\r\nthoroughly dry before it is again employed. The best resource in dry\r\nclimates is to stretch cords and hang these papers exposed to sun and\r\nair. Artificial heat must be resorted to in wet seasons, but the process\r\nis then slow and troublesome.\r\n\r\nFor a traveller wishing to make large collections, the time consumed in\r\nchanging the paper in which the plants are dried becomes an important\r\nconsideration. I have adopted with advantage a suggestion of the late\r\nProfessor A. Gray to use, instead of ordinary drying paper, sheets cut\r\nto the proper size, of the paper-felt which is used for laying under\r\ncarpets. The specimens when originally laid out for drying are placed\r\nwithin sheets of thin paper without size, such as filtering paper, and\r\nas a rule these do not need to be changed. One sheet of felt-paper is\r\ngenerally sufficient between each layer of plants, and the operation of\r\nchanging the paper is very quickly effected.\r\n\r\nIt is an important rule to note _the locality_ where the specimens have\r\nbeen collected, _with the date_. If proper care be taken to keep together\r\nall the specimens collected at the same time, it is not necessary to\r\nplace a separate scrap of paper within each sheet; but it is advisable to\r\ndo this when the dried specimens are packed for transmission home.\r\n\r\n5. _Seeds._—Travellers may easily make valuable contributions to our\r\nknowledge of the vegetation of distant countries by preserving seeds\r\nof remarkable and unusual plants. The only precautions necessary are,\r\nto select seeds that are fully ripe; if enclosed in a seed vessel, or\r\ncovering of a succulent character, to take care that this is thoroughly\r\ndried before they are packed; and that they are preserved from moisture\r\nduring the homeward voyage. Small seeds may be enclosed in paper, the\r\nlarger kinds in canvas bags, and the whole wrapped in a piece of oiled\r\ncloth. It is very desirable to keep each description of seed separate,\r\nand to note the place where it was gathered, with indications of\r\naltitude, soil, and climate.\r\n\r\n6. _Bulbs._—These are easily obtained, but as a rule, they should be\r\ntaken only at the end of the growing season, and kept until the leaves\r\nare quite withered. They should be packed dry in a small box with\r\nshavings, or other elastic stuffing. The same treatment will suit the\r\npseudo-bulbs of some orchids.\r\n\r\n7. _Fleshy Tubers._—Fleshy and thick tubers are best sent in boxes,\r\nwrapped in slightly moist materials, such as cocoa-nut fibre, peat, or\r\nleaf mould.\r\n\r\n8. _Living Plants._—As a general rule, these require to be established in\r\npots or boxes for some time before being packed for transmission. They\r\ntravel best in what are called Wardian cases; but an ordinary wooden box\r\ncovered with a glass top, and with sufficient moisture in the soil and\r\nair to prevent excessive evaporation, is found to answer the purpose. The\r\ncases should be kept on deck under some protection from the direct heat\r\nof the sun. Tropical plants should be despatched so as to reach England\r\nduring the summer months. At other seasons they are liable to perish from\r\ncold.\r\n\r\n9. _Succulent Plants_, such as cacti, aloe, houseleeks, &c., survive\r\nfor a long time if packed without earth in a perfectly dry box, with\r\nsufficient openings for ventilation.\r\n\r\n10. Small plants with woody roots and cuttings of larger species of\r\nplants from the north or south temperate zones often travel successfully\r\nwhen merely packed with a little soil, slightly moist, about the roots,\r\nand a wrapping of damp moss, or similar substance, tied up in thick paper\r\nor canvas. There is, however, much risk of failure in these cases where,\r\non the homeward voyage, it is necessary to pass through the tropics.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, plants are more often injured by excess of moisture\r\nthan by being sent too dry.\r\n\r\nIt is desirable to make use of every favourable opportunity for sending\r\nbotanical collections of all kinds to England, as in hot countries they\r\nare always exposed to risk of injury.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to mention that living plants, as well as seeds,\r\nand bulbs, should be placed in the hands of skilful gardeners after\r\nreaching this country. The chance of preserving interesting specimens\r\nis commonly much greater when they are sent to botanic gardens than when\r\nentrusted to private cultivators. In all cases information as to the\r\nsoil and climate of the native home of the plant is a necessary guide to\r\nproper treatment.\r\n\r\n_Fossils._—The collection of fossils and minerals (except in the case\r\nof the discovery of new localities for valuable metals) is not to be\r\nrecommended to the traveller, if he is not a geologist. Fossils from\r\nan unexplored country are of little use unless the nature and order of\r\nsuperposition of the strata in which they are found can be at the same\r\ntime investigated. In the cases, however, of recent alluvial strata or\r\nthe supposed beds of ancient lakes, or deposits in caves, or raised\r\nsea-beaches containing shells or bones of vertebrate animals, the\r\ntraveller will do well to bring away specimens if a good opportunity\r\noffers. If the plan of the expedition includes the collection of fossil\r\nremains, the traveller will, of course, provide himself with a proper\r\ngeological outfit, and obtain the necessary instructions before leaving\r\nEurope. (_See_ Section III.) For suggestions as to the collecting and\r\npreserving fossils and minerals, cf. British Museum ‘Handbook,’ pp.\r\n126-135.\r\n\r\n_General Remarks._—All collections made in tropical countries should\r\nbe sent to Europe with the least possible delay, as they soon become\r\ndeteriorated and spoilt unless great care be bestowed upon them.\r\n\r\n_Observations of Habits, etc._—Travellers have excellent opportunities\r\nof observing the habits of animals in a state of nature, and these\r\n‘Hints’ would be very deficient were not a few remarks made upon this\r\nsubject. To know what to observe in the economy of animals is in\r\nitself an accomplishment which it would be unreasonable to expect the\r\ngeneral traveller to possess, and without this he may bring home only\r\ninsignificant details, contributing but little to our stock of real\r\nknowledge. One general rule, however, may be kept always present to the\r\nmind, and this is, that anything concerning animals which bears upon the\r\nrelations of species to their conditions of life is well worth observing\r\nand recording. Thus, it is important to note the various enemies which\r\neach species has to contend with, not only at one epoch in its life,\r\nbut at every stage from birth to death, and at different seasons and in\r\ndifferent localities. The way in which the existence of enemies limits\r\nthe range of a species should also be noticed. The inorganic influences\r\nwhich inimically affect species, especially intermittently (such as the\r\noccurrence of disastrous seasons), and which are likely to operate\r\nin limiting their ranges, are also important subjects of inquiry. The\r\nmigrations of animals, and especially any facts about the irruption of\r\nspecies into districts previously uninhabited by them, are well worth\r\nrecording. The food of each species should be noticed, and if any change\r\nof customary food is observed, owing to the failure of the supply, it\r\nshould be carefully recorded. The use in nature of any peculiar physical\r\nconformation of animals, the object of ornamentation, and so forth,\r\nshould also be investigated whenever opportunity occurs. Any facts\r\nrelating to the interbreeding in a state of nature of allied varieties,\r\nor the converse—that is, the antipathy to intercrossing of allied\r\nvarieties—would be extremely interesting. In short, the traveller should\r\nbear in mind that facts having a philosophical bearing are much more\r\nimportant than mere anecdotes about animals.\r\n\r\nTo observe the actions of the larger animals, a telescope or field-glass\r\nwill be necessary. The traveller should bear in mind, if a microscope\r\nis needed in his journey, that by unscrewing the tubes of the telescope\r\nin which all the small glasses are contained, a compound microscope of\r\nconsiderable power may be produced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nANTHROPOLOGY.\r\n\r\n_By the late SIR E. B. TYLOR, D.C.L., F.R.S._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe characters of men’s bodies and minds being matters of common\r\nobservation, Europeans not specially trained in anthropology, who have\r\nhappened to be thrown among little-known tribes, often bring home\r\nvaluable anthropological information. Though explorers, traders, and\r\ncolonists have made their way into almost every corner of the earth, it\r\nis surprising to find how many new facts may still be noted down by any\r\ncareful observer. If familiar with anthropological methods, he will, of\r\ncourse, observe more and better. The hints here given will serve to draw\r\nattention to interesting points which might otherwise be overlooked.\r\nDirections for such investigation, drawn up in much greater detail, will\r\nbe found in the small British Association manual entitled: ‘Notes and\r\nQueries on Anthropology’ (Royal Anthropological Institute, 50, Great\r\nRussell Street, W., 4th edition (1912), price 5_s._) For fuller details\r\nsee the international agreement for the Unification of Anthropometric\r\nMeasurements to be made on the living subject. English translation of the\r\nofficial version, W. L. H. Duckworth.\r\n\r\n_Physical Characters._—On first coming among an unfamiliar race, such\r\nas the Negroes, the traveller is apt to think them almost alike, till\r\nafter a few days he learns to distinguish individuals more sharply. This\r\nfirst impression, however, has a value of its own, for what he vaguely\r\nperceived was the general type of the race, which he may afterwards\r\ngain a more perfect idea of by careful comparison. Among tribes who for\r\nmany generations have led a simple uniform life and mixed little with\r\nstrangers, the general likeness of build and feature is very close, as\r\nmay be seen in a photograph of a party of Caribs or Andamaners, whose\r\nuniformity contrasts instructively with the individualised faces of a\r\nparty of Europeans. The consequence is that a traveller among a rude\r\npeople, if he has something of the artist’s faculty of judging form, may\r\nselect groups for photography which will fairly represent the type of\r\na whole tribe or nation. While such portrait-groups are admirable for\r\ngiving the general idea of a race, characteristic features belonging\r\nto it should be treated separately. For instance, to do justice to the\r\nTartar eye or the Australian forehead, the individual feature must be\r\ncarefully sketched or photographed large.\r\n\r\nHow deceptive mere unmeasured impressions of size may be is shown by\r\nthe well-known example of the Patagonians, who, though really only tall\r\nmen (averaging 5 feet 11 inches), long had the reputation of a race of\r\ngiants. Such measurements as any traveller can take with a measuring-tape\r\nand a three-foot rule with sliding square are good if taken with proper\r\nprecautions. As the object of the anthropologist is to get a general\r\nidea of a race, it may be in some respects misleading to measure at\r\nrandom one or two individuals who are perhaps not fair specimens. If\r\nonly a few can be measured, they should be selected of ordinary average\r\nbuild, full-grown but not aged. What is much better is to measure a\r\nlarge number (never less than thirty) of persons taken indiscriminately\r\nas they come, and to record the measurements of each with sex, age,\r\nname, locality, etc. Such a table can afterwards be so classified as to\r\nshow not only the average or mean size, but the proportion of persons\r\nwho vary more or less from that mean size; in fact, it represents on\r\na small scale the distribution of stature, etc., in the whole people.\r\nGigantic or dwarfish individuals, if not deformed, are interesting, as\r\nshowing to what extremes the race may run. The most ordinary measurements\r\nare height, girth round chest, fathom or length of outstretched arms,\r\nlength of arm from shoulder and leg from hip, length of hand and foot.\r\nThe traveller may find that such measuring of another race shows very\r\ndifferent stature and girth from that of his own companions, who, if\r\nthey are well-grown Europeans, may stand 5 feet 8 inches to 6 feet,\r\nand measure 34 to 36 inches round the chest. Beyond this, he will find\r\nthat the relative proportions of parts of the body differ from those\r\nhe is accustomed to. An example of this is seen by placing Europeans\r\nand negroes side by side, and noticing how much nearer the knee the\r\nnegro’s finger-tips will reach. It will be found that body measurement\r\nneeds skill in taking the corresponding points, and in fact all but the\r\nsimplest measures require some knowledge of anatomy. This is especially\r\nthe case with skull measurements. There are instruments for taking the\r\ndimensions of the living head, and with care and practice the untrained\r\nobserver may get at some of the more conspicuous, such as the relative\r\nlength and width of the skull as taken by hatters. This roughly indicates\r\nthe marked difference between dolichocephalic or long-headed peoples,\r\nlike the African negro, and brachycephalic or short-headed peoples, like\r\nthe Kalmuks and other Tartars. Attention should be paid also to the\r\ndegree of prognathism or projection of jaw, which in some races, as the\r\nAustralian, gives a “muzzle” unlike the English type. Where practicable,\r\nnative skeletons, and especially skulls, should be sent home for accurate\r\nexamination. How far this can be done depends much on the feeling of the\r\npeople; for while some tribes do not object to the removal of bones,\r\nespecially if not of their own kinsfolk, in other districts it is hardly\r\nsafe to risk the displeasure of the natives at the removal of the dead—a\r\nfeeling which is not only due to affection or respect, but even more to\r\nterror of the vengeance of the ghosts whose relics have been disturbed.\r\n\r\nIn describing complexion, such terms as “brown” or “olive,” so often\r\nused without further definition in books of travel, are too inexact\r\nto be of use. Broca’s scale of colours (_see_ Final Report of British\r\nAssociation Committee on Anthropometric Method. R. Anthrop. Institute,\r\n1909) gives means of matching the tints of skin, hair and eyes; if\r\nthis is not forthcoming, the paint-box should be used to record them.\r\nAmong rude tribes, the colour of the skin is often so masked by paint\r\nand dirt that the subject must be washed to see the real complexion.\r\nHair is also an important race-mark, varying as it does in colour from\r\nflaxen to black, and also in form and size of the hairs; for instance\r\nthe American Indian’s coarse straight hair seems almost like a horse’s\r\ntail in comparison with the Bushman’s hair with its natural frizz of tiny\r\nspirals. Locks of hair should therefore be collected. The traveller,\r\nhowever, will often find some difficulty in getting such specimens, from\r\nthe objection prevalent in the uncivilised world of letting any part of\r\nthe body, such as hair and nail-clippings, pass into strangers’ hands\r\nlest they should be used to bewitch their former owner. Even in such\r\ncountries as Italy, to ask for a lock of a peasant-girl’s hair may lead\r\nto the anthropologist being suspected of wishing to practise love-charms\r\non her.\r\n\r\nDifferences of temperament between nations are commonly to be noticed;\r\nfor instance, in comparing the shy and grave Malays with the boisterous\r\nAfricans. It is an interesting but difficult problem how far such\r\ndifferences are due to inherited race-character, and how far to such\r\nsocial influences as education and custom, and to the conditions of\r\nlife being cheerful or depressing. Nor has it yet been determined how\r\nfar emotions are differently expressed by different races, so that\r\nit is worth while to notice particularly if their smiling, laughing,\r\nfrowning, weeping, blushing, etc., differ perceptibly from ours. The\r\nacuteness of the senses of sight, hearing and smell, among wild peoples\r\nis often remarkable, but this subject is one on which many accounts have\r\nbeen given which require sifting. The skill of savages in path-finding\r\nand tracking depends in great measure on this being one of their most\r\nnecessary arts of life to which they are trained from childhood, as, in\r\nan inferior degree, gipsies are with us. The native hunter or guide’s\r\nmethods of following the track of an animal, or finding his own way\r\nhome by slight signs, such as bent twigs, and keeping general direction\r\nthrough the forest by the sky and the sheltered sides of the trees, are\r\nvery interesting, though when learnt they lose much of their marvellous\r\nappearance. The testing of the mental powers of various races is an\r\ninteresting research, for which good opportunities now and then occur.\r\nIt is established that some races are inferior to others in volume and\r\ncomplexity of brain, Australians and Africans being in this respect\r\nbelow Europeans, and the question is to determine what differences\r\nof mind may correspond. Setting aside the contemptuous notions of\r\nuneducated Europeans as to the minds of “black-fellows” or “niggers,”\r\nwhat is required is, to compare the capacity of two races under similar\r\ncircumstances. This is made difficult by the fact of different training.\r\nFor instance, it would not be fair to compare the European sportsman’s\r\nskill in woodcraft and hunting with that of the native hunter, who\r\nhas done nothing else since childhood; while, on the other hand, the\r\nEuropean, who has always lived among civilised people, owes to his\r\neducation so much of his superior reasoning powers, that it is mostly\r\nimpossible to get his mind into comparison with a savage’s. One of the\r\nbest tests is the progress made by native and European children in\r\ncolonial or missionary schools, as to which it is commonly stated that\r\nchildren of African or American tribes learn as fast as or faster than\r\nEuropean children up to about twelve, but then fall behind. Even here it\r\nis evident that other causes besides mental power may be at work, among\r\nthem the discouragement of the native children when they become aware of\r\ntheir social inferiority. The subject is one of great importance, both\r\nscientifically and as bearing on practical government.\r\n\r\nBoth as a matter of anthropology and of practical politics the\r\nsuitability of particular races to particular climates is of great\r\ninterest; sometimes this depends on one race being free from a disease\r\nfrom which another suffers, as in the well-known immunity of negroes from\r\nyellow fever. Or it may be evident that tribes have become acclimatised,\r\nso as to resist influences which are deadly to strangers; for instance,\r\nthe Khonds flourish in the hills of Orissa, where not only Europeans but\r\nthe Hindus of the plains sicken of the malaria in the unhealthy season.\r\nThat such peculiarities of constitution are inherited and pass into the\r\nnature of the race, is one of the keys to the obscure problem of the\r\norigins of the various races of man as connected with their spread over\r\nthe globe. As yet this problem has not passed much beyond the stage of\r\ncollecting information, and no pains should be spared to get at facts\r\nthus bearing on the history and development of the human species.\r\nEuropean medical men in districts inhabited by uncivilised races have\r\noften made important observations of this kind, which they are glad to\r\ncommunicate, though being occupied with professional work they do not\r\nfollow them up. In all races there occur abnormal varieties, which should\r\nbe observed with reference to their being hereditary, such as Albinos,\r\nwhose dead-whiteness is due to absence of pigment from the skin. Even\r\nsuch tendencies as that to the occurrence of red hair where the ordinary\r\nhue is black, or to melanism or diseased darkening of the skin, are worth\r\nremark. It is essential to discover how far these descend from parents\r\nto children, which is not the case with such alterations as that of the\r\nChinese feet, which, in spite of generations of cramping, continue of the\r\nnatural shape in the children.\r\n\r\n_Language._—Before coming to actual language, remark may be made on the\r\nnatural communication of all races carried on by pantomimic signs without\r\nspoken words. This is the “gesture language” to which we are accustomed\r\namong the deaf-and-dumb, and which sometimes also comes into practical\r\nuse between tribes ignorant of one another’s languages, as on the\r\nAmerican prairies. It is so far the same in principle everywhere, that\r\nthe explorer visiting a new tribe, having to make frequent use of signs\r\nto supplement his interpreter, or to eke out his own scanty knowledge\r\nof the native language, soon adapts himself to the particular signs in\r\nvogue. He will observe that, as to most common signs, such as asking for\r\nfood or drink, or beckoning or warning off a stranger, he understands\r\nand is understood quite naturally. Signs which are puzzling at first\r\nsight will prove on examination to be intelligible. Some are imitative\r\ngestures cut short to save trouble, or they may have a meaning which was\r\nonce evident, like the American Indian sign for dog, made by trailing\r\ntwo forked fingers, which does not show its meaning now, but did so in\r\npast times, when one of the principal occupations of the dog was to trail\r\na pair of tent-poles attached to his back. Besides its practical use,\r\nthe gesture-language has much scientific interest from the perfect way\r\nin which it exposes the working of the human mind, expressing itself by\r\na series of steps which are all intelligible. It will be particularly\r\nobserved that it has a strict syntax; for instance, that the quality or\r\nadjective must always follow the subject or substantive it is applied to.\r\nThus, “the white box” may be expressed by imitating the shape and opening\r\nof a box, and then touching a piece of linen or paper to show its colour;\r\nbut if the signs be put in the contrary order, as in the English words,\r\nthe native will be perplexed. It is worth while, in countries where\r\ngesture-language is regularly used, to note down the usual signs and\r\ntheir exact order.\r\n\r\nIn recording a vocabulary of a language not yet reduced to form in a\r\ngrammar and dictionary, the traveller may seek for equivalents of the\r\nprincipal classes of words in his own grammar: verbs, substantives,\r\nadjectives, pronouns, prepositions, etc. But the structure of the\r\nlanguage he is examining will probably differ from any he is familiar\r\nwith, the words actually used not coming precisely into these classes.\r\nThe best method is for the traveller to learn a simple sentence, such as\r\n“the men are coming,” and to ascertain what changes will convert them\r\ninto “the men are going,” “the women are coming.” He thus arrives at the\r\nreal elements of the language and the method of combining them. Having\r\narrived at this point, he will be able to collect and classify current\r\nideas, such as the following:—\r\n\r\n    _Actions_—as stand, walk, sleep, eat, see, make, etc.\r\n\r\n    _Natural Objects and Elements_—as sun, moon, star, mountain,\r\n    river, fire, water, etc.\r\n\r\n    _Man and other Animals_—as man, woman, boy, girl, deer, buck,\r\n    doe, eagle, eagles, etc.\r\n\r\n    _Parts of Body_—as head, arm, leg, skin, bone, blood, etc.\r\n\r\n    _Trees and Plants._\r\n\r\n    _Numerals_ (noticing how far they extend, and whether referring\r\n    to fingers).\r\n\r\n    _Instruments and Appliances_—as spear, bow, hatchet, needle,\r\n    pot, boat, cord, house, roof, &c.\r\n\r\n    _Arts and Pastimes_—as picture, paint, carving, statue, song,\r\n    dance, toy, game, riddle, &c.\r\n\r\n    _Family Relationships_ (as defined by native custom).\r\n\r\n    _Social and Legal Terms_—as chief, freeman, slave, witness,\r\n    punishment, fine, &c.\r\n\r\n    _Religious Terms_—as soul, spirit, dream, vision, sacrifice,\r\n    penance, &c.\r\n\r\n    _Moral Terms_—as truth, falsehood, kindness, treachery, love,\r\n    &c.\r\n\r\n    _Abstract Terms_, relating to time, space, colour, shape,\r\n    power, cause, &c.\r\n\r\nThe interjections used in any language can be noted, whether they are\r\norganic expressions of emotion, like _oh!_ _ugh!_ _ur-r-r!_ or sounds\r\nthe nature of which is not so evident. Also imitative words which name\r\nanimals from their cries, or express sounding objects or actions by their\r\nsounds, are common in all languages, and strike the stranger. Examples\r\nof such are _kah-kah_ for a crow, _twonk_ for a frog, _pututu_ for a\r\nshell-trumpet, _haitschu_ for to sneeze. When such imitative words are\r\nnoticed passing into other meanings where the connection with sound\r\nis not obvious, they become interesting facts in the development of\r\nlanguage; as, to take a familiar example from English, the imitative verb\r\nto _puff_ becomes a term for light pastry and metaphorically blown-up\r\npraise.\r\n\r\nIt is only when the traveller has a long or close acquaintance with a\r\ntribe, that he is able to deal satisfactorily with the vocabulary and\r\nstructure of their language. To be able to carry on a conversation in\r\nbroken sentences is not enough, for an actual grammar and dictionary is\r\nrequired to enable philologists to make out the structure and affinities\r\nwith other languages. It used to be customary to send out English lists\r\nof thirty or forty ordinary words to have equivalents put to them in\r\nnative languages. As every detail of this kind is worth having, these\r\nlists cannot be said to be quite worthless, but they go hardly any way\r\ntoward what is really wanted. They are liable to frequent mistakes, as\r\nwhen the barbarian, from whom the white man is trying to get the term\r\n“foot,” answers with a word meaning “my leg,” which is carefully taken\r\ndown and printed. Such poor vocabularies cannot even be relied on to\r\nshow whether a language belongs to a particular family, for the very\r\nword which seems to prove this may be borrowed. Thus, in various African\r\nvocabularies, there appears the word _sapun_ (or something similar) with\r\nthe meaning of _soap_; but this is a Latin word which has spread far\r\nand wide from one country to another, and proves nothing as to original\r\nconnection between languages which have adopted it. While it is best\r\nnot to under-rate the difficulty of collecting such information as to\r\na little-known dialect as will be really of service to philology, it\r\nmust be remembered that travellers still often have opportunities of\r\npreserving relics of languages, or at any rate special dialects, which\r\nare on the point of dying out unrecorded. Where no proper grammar and\r\ndictionary has been compiled, it is often possible to find some European\r\nor some interpreter fairly conversant with the language, with whose aid\r\na vocabulary may be written out and sentences analysed grammatically,\r\nwhich, when read over to intelligent natives and criticised by them,\r\nmay be worked into good linguistic material. It is worth while to pay\r\nattention to native names of plants, minerals, &c., as well as of places\r\nand persons, for these are often terms carrying significant meaning. Thus\r\n_ipecacuanha_ is stated by Martius to be _i-pe-caa-guéne_, which in the\r\nTupi language of Brazil, signifies “the little wayside plant which makes\r\nvomit.”\r\n\r\n_Arts and Sciences._—The less civilised a nation is, the ruder are its\r\ntools and contrivances; but these are often worked with curious skill\r\nin getting excellent results with the roughest means. Stone implements\r\nhave now been so supplanted by iron that they are not easily found in\r\nactual use. If a chance of seeing them occurs, as, for instance, among\r\nsome Californian tribe, who still chip out arrow-heads of obsidian, it is\r\nwell to get a lesson in the curious and difficult art of stone-implement\r\nmaking. In general, tools and implements differing from those of the\r\ncivilised world, even down to the pointed stick for root-digging and\r\nplanting, are worth collecting, and to learn their use from a skilled\r\nhand often brings into view remarkable peculiarities. This is the case\r\nwith many cudgel or boomerang-like weapons thrown at game, slings or\r\nspear-throwers for hurling darts to greater distances than they can be\r\nsent by hand, blow-tubes for killing birds, and even the bow-and-arrow,\r\nwhich in northern Asia and America shows the ancient Scythian or Tartar\r\nform, having to be bent inside out to string it. Though fire is now\r\npractically made almost everywhere with flint and steel or lucifers,\r\nin some districts, as South Africa or Polynesia, people still know the\r\nprimitive method of fire-making by rubbing or drilling a pointed stick\r\ninto another piece of wood. Europeans find difficulty in learning this\r\nold art, which requires some knack. As is well known to sportsmen,\r\ndifferent districts have their special devices for netting, trapping\r\nand other ways of taking game and fish, some of which are well worth\r\nnotice, such as spearing or shooting fish under water, artificial decoys,\r\nand the spring-traps set with bent boughs, which are supposed to have\r\nfirst suggested the idea of the bow. While the use of dogs in hunting\r\nis found in most parts of the world, there is the utmost variety of\r\nbreeds and training. Agriculture in its lower stages is carried on by\r\nsimple processes; but interesting questions arise as to the origin of\r\nits grain and fruits, and the alterations in them by transplanting into\r\na new climate and by ages of cultivation. Thus in Chili there is found\r\nwild what botanists consider the original potato; but while maize was a\r\nstaple of both Americas at the time of Columbus, its original form has no\r\nmore been identified than that of wheat in the Old World. The cookery of\r\nall nations is in principle known to the civilised European; but there\r\nare special preparations to notice, such as bucaning or drying meat on\r\na hurdle above a slow fire, broiling kebabs or morsels of meat on the\r\nskewer in the East, etc. Many peoples have something peculiar in the way\r\nof beverages, such as the chewed Polynesian _kava_, or the South American\r\n_maté_ sucked through a tube. Especially fermented liquors have great\r\nvariety, such as the _kumiss_ from mares’ milk in Tartary, the _pombe_ or\r\nmillet-beer of Africa, and the _kvass_ or rye-beer of Russia. The rudest\r\npottery made by hand, not thrown on the wheel, is less and less often met\r\nwith, but ornamentation traceable to its being moulded on baskets is to\r\nbe seen; and calabashes, joints of bamboo, and close-plaited baskets are\r\nused for water-vessels, and even to boil in. Among the curious processes\r\nof metal-working, contrasting with those of modern Europe, though\r\noften showing skill of their own, may be mentioned the simple African\r\nsmelting-forge by which iron-ore is reduced with charcoal in a hole in\r\nthe ground, the draught being supplied by a pair of skins for bellows.\r\nIn the far East a kind of air-pump is used, of which the barrels are\r\nhollowed logs. The Chinese art of patching cast-iron with melted metal\r\nsurprises a European, and the Hindu manufacture of native steel (_wootz_)\r\nis a remarkable process. No nation now exists absolutely in the Bronze\r\nAge, but this alloy still occupies something of its old place in Oriental\r\nindustry. As an example of the methods still to be seen, may be mentioned\r\nthe Burmese bell-founding, which is done, not in a hollow mould of sand,\r\nbut by what in Europe is called the _cire perdue_ process, the model of\r\nthe bell being made in beeswax and imbedded in the sand-mould, the wax\r\nbeing melted and the hot metal taking its place. The whole history of\r\nmachinery is open to the traveller, who still meets with every stage\r\nof its development, from savagery upward. He sees, for instance, every\r\ntilling implement from the stake with fire-hardened point, and the hoe\r\nof crooked branch, up to the modern forms of plough. In like manner he\r\ncan trace the line from the rudest stone-crushers or rubbers for grinding\r\nseed or grain up to the rotating hand-mills or querns still common in\r\nthe East, and surviving even in Scotland. From time to time some special\r\ncontrivance may be seen near its original home, as in South America\r\nthe curious plaited tube for wringing out the juice from cassava, or\r\nthe net hammock which still retains its native Haitian name _hamaca_.\r\nArchitecture still preserves in different regions interesting early\r\nstages of development, from the rudest breakwinds, or beehive huts of\r\nwattled boughs, up to houses of logs and hewn timber, structures of mud\r\nand adobes, and masonry of rough or hewn stone. Even the construction\r\nof the bough-hut or the log-house often has its peculiarities in the\r\narrangements of posts and rafters. Among the modes of construction\r\nwhich interest the student of architectural history is building with\r\nrough unhewn stones. Many examples of “rude stone monuments” are to be\r\nseen on our own moors and hills. The most familiar kinds are _dolmens_\r\n(_i.e._, “table-stones”), formed by upright stones bearing a cap-stone;\r\nthey were burial-places, and analogous to the cists or chambers of rough\r\nslabs within burial-mounds. Less clearly explicable are the single\r\nstanding-stones or _menhirs_ (_i.e._, “long-stones”), and the circles of\r\nstones or _cromlechs_. Ancient and obscure in meaning as such monuments\r\nare in Europe, there are regions where their construction or use comes\r\ndown to modern times, especially in India, where among certain tribes\r\nthe deposit of ashes of the dead in dolmens, the erection of menhirs\r\nin memory of great men, and even sacrifice in stone circles, are\r\nwell-known customs. The traveller may also sometimes have opportunities\r\nof observing the ancient architectural construction by fitting together\r\nmany-sided stones into what are sometimes called Cyclopean walls, a\r\nkind of building which seems to have preceded the use of squared blocks,\r\nfastened together with clamps or with mortar. Vaulting or roofing by\r\nmeans of courses of stones projecting inwards one course above the other\r\n(much as children build with their wooden bricks), so as to form what\r\narchitects call a “false arch,” is an ancient mode of construction found\r\nin various parts of the world where the “true arch” with its keystone\r\nhas not superseded it. It often appears that rude nations have copied\r\nthe more artistic buildings of higher neighbours, or inherited ancient\r\narchitectural traditions. Thus traces of Indian architecture have found\r\ntheir way into the islands of the Eastern Archipelago, and hollow squares\r\nof mud-built houses round a courtyard in northern Africa have their plan\r\nfrom the Asiatic caravanserai. In boat-building some primitive forms, as\r\nthe “dug-out,” hollowed by the aid of fire from a tree-trunk, and the\r\nbark-canoe, are found in such distant regions that we cannot guess where\r\nthey had their origin. When, however, it comes to the outrigger-canoe,\r\nthis belongs to a district which, though very large, is still limited, so\r\nthat we may at least guess whereabouts it first came into use, and it is\r\nimportant to note every island to which it has since travelled. So there\r\nis much in the peculiar build and rig of Malay prahus, Chinese junks,\r\netc., which is worth noting as part of the history of ship-building.\r\nThis may suffice to give a general idea of the kind of information as to\r\nthe local arts which it is worth while to collect, and to illustrate by\r\ndrawings and photographs of objects too large to bring away.\r\n\r\nNaturally, nations below the upper levels of culture have little or no\r\nscience to teach us, but many of their ideas are interesting as marking\r\nstages in the history of the human mind. Thus, in the art of counting,\r\nwhich is one of the foundations of science, it is common to find the\r\nprimitive method of counting by fingers and toes still in practical use,\r\nwhile in many languages the numeral words have evidently grown up out\r\nof such a state of things. Thus _lima_, the well-known Polynesian word\r\nfor five, meant “hand,” before it passed into a numeral. All devices for\r\ncounting are worth notice, from the African little sticks for units and\r\nlarger sticks for tens, up to the ball-frames with which the Chinese and\r\nRussian traders reckon so rapidly and correctly. It is a sign of lowness\r\nin a tribe not to use measures and weights, and where these appear in\r\na rough way, it is interesting to discover whether vague lengths, such\r\nas finger, foot, pace, are used, or whether standard measures and\r\nweights have come in. If so, these should be estimated according to\r\nour standards with as much accuracy as possible, as it may thus become\r\npossible to ascertain their history. In connection with this comes the\r\nquestion of money, as to whether commerce is still in the rudimentary\r\nstage of exchanging gifts, or has passed into regular barter, or risen to\r\nregular trade, with some sort of money to represent value, even if the\r\ncirculating medium be only cowries, or bits of iron, or cakes of salt,\r\nall which are current money to this day in parts of Africa. Outside the\r\npresent higher civilisation, more or less primitive ideas of astronomy\r\nand geography will be found to prevail. Among tribes like the American\r\nIndians the obvious view suggested by the senses still prevails, that\r\nthe earth is a flat round disc (or sometimes square, with four quarters\r\nor winds) overarched by a solid dome or firmament, on which the sun and\r\nmoon travel—in inland countries going in and out at holes or doors on\r\nthe horizon, or, if the sea bounds the view, rising from and plunging\r\ninto its waves at sunrise and sunset. These early notions are to us\r\nvery instructive, as they enable us to realise the conceptions of the\r\nuniverse which have come down to us in the ancient books of the world,\r\nbut which scientific education has uprooted from our own minds. With\r\nthese cosmic ideas are found among the lowest races the two natural\r\nperiods of time, namely, the lunar month and the solar year, determined\r\nby recurring winters, summers, or rainy seasons. Such tribes divide the\r\nday roughly by the sun’s height in the sky, but among peoples civilised\r\nenough to have time-measures and the sun-dial, there is a tolerably\r\naccurate knowledge of the sun’s place at the longest and shortest days,\r\nand indeed, throughout the year. The astronomy of such countries as India\r\nhas been of course described by professional astronomers; but among ruder\r\nnations there is still a great deal unrecorded—for instance, as to the\r\nconstellations into which they map out the heavens. This likening stars\r\nand star-groups to animals and other objects is almost universal among\r\nmankind. Savages like the Australians still make fanciful stories about\r\nthem, as that Castor and Pollux are two native hunters, who pursue the\r\nkangaroo (Capella) and kill him at the beginning of the hot season. Such\r\nstories enable us to understand the myths of the Classical Dictionary,\r\nwhile modern astronomers keep up the old constellations as a convenient\r\nmode of mapping out the sky. As to maps of the earth, even low tribes\r\nhave some notion of their principle, and can roughly draw the chart\r\nof their own district, which they should be encouraged to do. Native\r\nknowledge of natural history differs from much of their rude science in\r\nits quality, often being of great positive value. The savage or barbarian\r\nhunter knows the animals of his own region and their habits with\r\nremarkable accuracy, and inherited experience has taught him that certain\r\nplants have industrial and medicinal uses. Thus, in South America the\r\nEuropeans learnt the use of India-rubber or caoutchouc, which the native\r\ntribes were accustomed to make into vessels and playing-balls, and of the\r\nPeruvian bark or cinchona, which was already given to patients in fever.\r\n\r\nHere a few words may be said of magic, which, though so utterly futile\r\nin practice, is a sort of early and unsuccessful attempt at science. It\r\nis easy, on looking into the proceedings of the magician, to see that\r\nmany of them are merely attempts to work by false analogy or deceptive\r\nassociation of ideas. The attempt to hurt or kill a person by cutting\r\nor piercing a rude picture or image representing him, which is met with\r\nin all the four quarters of the globe, is a perfect example of the way\r\nin which sorcerers mistake mere association of ideas for real cause\r\nand effect. Examined from this point of view, it will be found that a\r\nlarge proportion of the magic rites of the world will explain their own\r\nmeaning. It is true that this is not the only principle at work in the\r\nmagician’s mind; for instance, he seems to reason in a loose way that any\r\nextraordinary thing will produce any extraordinary effect, so that the\r\npeculiar stones and bits of wood which we should call curiosities become\r\nto the African sorcerer powerful fetishes. It will often be noticed that\r\narts belonging to the systematic magic of the civilised world, which has\r\nits source in Babylon and Egypt, have found their way into distant lands\r\nmore readily indeed than useful knowledge, so that they may even be met\r\nwith among barbaric tribes. Thus it has lately been pointed out that the\r\nsystem of lucky and unlucky days, which led the natives in Madagascar to\r\nkill many infants as of inauspicious birth, is adopted from Arabic magic,\r\nand it is to be expected that many other magical arts, if their formulas\r\nare accurately described, may in like manner be traced to their origin.\r\n\r\n_Society._—One of the most interesting features of savage and barbaric\r\nlife is the existence of an unwritten code of moral conduct, by which\r\nfamilies and tribes are practically held together. There may be no\r\nlaws to punish crime, and the local religion may no more concern\r\nitself directly with men’s behaviour to one another than it did in\r\nthe South Sea Islands. But among the roughest people there is family\r\naffection, and some degree of mutual help and trust, without which,\r\nindeed, it is obvious that society would break up, perhaps in general\r\nslaughter. Considering the importance of this primitive morality in the\r\nhistory of mankind, it is unfortunate that the attention of travellers\r\nhas been so little drawn to it, that our information is most meagre\r\nas to how far family affection among rude tribes may be taken to be\r\ninstinctive, like that of the lower animals, or how far morality is\r\nproduced by public opinion favouring such conduct as is for the public\r\ngood, but blaming acts which do harm to the tribe. It is desirable to\r\ninquire what conduct is sanctioned by custom among any people, whether,\r\nfor instance, infanticide is thought right or wrong, what freedom\r\nof behaviour is approved in youths and girls, and so on. For though\r\nbreaches of custom may not be actually punishable, experience will soon\r\nconvince any explorer among any rude tribe that custom acts in regulating\r\ntheir life even more strictly than among ourselves. The notion of even\r\nsavages leading a free and unrestrained life is contradicted by those\r\nwho know them best; in fact, they are bound in every act by ancestral\r\ncustom. While each tribe thus has its moral standard of right and wrong,\r\nthis differs much in different tribes, and one must become intimately\r\nacquainted with any people to ascertain what are really their ruling\r\nprinciples of life. Accounts have been often given of the natural virtue\r\nand happiness of rude tribes, as in the forests of Guiana or the hills of\r\nBengal, where the simple native life is marked by truthfulness, honesty,\r\ncheerfulness, and kindness, which contrast in a striking way with the\r\nhabits of low-class Europeans. There are few phenomena in the world more\r\ninstructive than morality thus existing in practical independence either\r\nof law or religion. It may still be possible to observe it for a few\r\nyears before it is altered by contact with civilisation, which, whether\r\nit raises or lowers on the whole the native level, must supersede in\r\ngreat measure this simple family morality.\r\n\r\nThe unit of social life is the family, and the family is based on a\r\nmarriage-law. Travellers who have not looked carefully into the social\r\nrules of tribes they were describing, or whose experience has been of\r\ntribes in a state of decay, have sometimes reported that marriage hardly\r\nexisted. But this state of things is not confirmed as descriptive of any\r\nhealthy human society, however rude; in fact, the absence of definite\r\nmarriage appears incompatible with the continued existence of a tribe.\r\nTherefore statements of this kind made by former visitors should be\r\ncarefully sifted, and marriage-laws in general deserve careful study.\r\nThe explorer will hardly meet with marriage at so low a stage that\r\nthe union can be described as little beyond annual pairing; but where\r\ndivorce is almost unrestricted, as in some African tribes, there is more\r\nor less approach to this condition, which is possible, though unusual,\r\nunder such laws as that of Islam. Polygamy, which exists over a large\r\npart of the globe, is a well-understood system, but information is less\r\ncomplete as to the reasons which have here and there led to its opposite\r\npolyandry, as among the Toda hill-tribes and the Nairs in South India.\r\nAmong customs deserving inquiry are match-making festivals at spring-tide\r\nor harvest, when a great part of the year’s marriages are arranged. This\r\nis not only often done among the lower races, but traces of it remain in\r\nGreece, where the dances at Megara on Easter Tuesday are renowned for\r\nwife-choosing, and till lately in Brittany, where on Michaelmas Day the\r\ngirls sate in a row decked in all their finery on the bridge of Penzé,\r\nnear Morlaix. The custom of bride-capture, where the bridegroom and his\r\nfriends make show of carrying off the bride by violence, is known in\r\nEurope as a relic of antiquity, as in ancient Rome, Wales within the\r\nlast century or two, or Tyrol at the present day; but in more barbaric\r\nregions, as on the Malay peninsula or among the Kalmuks of North Asia,\r\nit may be often met with, practised as a ceremony, or even done in\r\nearnest. On the other hand, restrictions on marriage between kinsfolk or\r\nclansfolk are more prominent among the lower races than in the civilised\r\nworld, but their motive is even now imperfectly understood. Partly these\r\nrestrictions take the form we are accustomed to of prohibiting marriage\r\nbetween relatives more or less near in our sense, but among nations\r\nat a lower level they are apt to involve also what is called exogamy\r\nor “marrying-out.” A tribe or people—for instance, the Kamilaroi of\r\nAustralia, or the Iroquois of North America—is divided into hereditary\r\nclans, members of which may not marry in their own clan. In various parts\r\nof the world these clans are named from some animal, plant, or other\r\nobject, and anthropologists often call such names “totems,” this word\r\nbeing taken from the native name among Algonquin tribes of North America.\r\nFor an instance of the working of this custom among the Iroquois tribes\r\na Wolf was considered brother to a Wolf of any other tribe, and might\r\nnot marry a Wolf girl, who was considered as his sister, but he might\r\nmarry a Deer or a Heron. In contrast with such rules is the practice of\r\nendogamy, or “marrying-in,” as among some Arab tribes, who habitually\r\nmarry cousins. But it will be found that the two rules often go together,\r\nas where a Hindu must practically marry within his own caste, but at\r\nthe same time is prohibited from marrying in his own gotra or clan.\r\nResearches into totem-laws are apt to bring the traveller into contact\r\nwith other relics of the ancient social institutions in which these laws\r\nare rooted, especially the practice of reckoning descent not on the\r\nfather’s side, as with us, but on the mother’s side, after the manner of\r\nthe Lycians, whose custom seemed extraordinary to the Greeks in the time\r\nof Herodotus, but may be still seen in existence among native tribes of\r\nAmerica or in the Malay islands. Even the system of relationship familiar\r\nto Europeans is far different from those of regions where forms of the\r\n“classificatory system” prevail, in which father’s brothers and mother’s\r\nsisters are called fathers and mothers. In inquiring into native laws of\r\nmarriage and descent, precautions must be taken to ensure accuracy, and\r\nespecially such ambiguous English words as “uncle” or “cousin” should be\r\nkept clear of.\r\n\r\nAnother point on which travellers have great opportunity of seeing with\r\ntheir own eyes the working of primitive society is the holding and\r\ninheritance of property, especially land. Notions derived from our modern\r\nlaw of landlord and tenant give place in the traveller’s mind to older\r\nconceptions, among which individual property in land is hardly found.\r\nIn rude society it is very generally the tribe which owns a district as\r\ncommon land, where all may hunt and pasture and cut fire-wood; while,\r\nwhen a family have built a hut, and tilled a patch of land round it, this\r\nis held in common by the family while they live there, but falls back\r\ninto tribe-land if they cease to occupy it. This is further organised in\r\nwhat are now often called “village communities,” which may be seen in\r\noperation in Russia and India, where the village fields are portioned out\r\namong the villagers. Those who have seen them can understand the many\r\ntraces in England of the former prevalence of this system in “common\r\nfields,” etc. There is the more practical interest in studying the\r\nworking of this old-world system from the light it throws on projects of\r\ncommunistic division of land, which in such villages may be studied, and\r\nits merits and defects balanced. On the one hand it assures a maintenance\r\nfor all, while on the other it limits the population of a district, the\r\nmore so from the obstinate resistance which the counsel of “old men”\r\nwho manage a village always oppose to any improved method of tillage.\r\nNot less perfectly do the tenures existing in many countries show the\r\nvarious stages of landholding which arise out of military conquest. The\r\nabsolute ownership of all the land by a barbaric chief or king, which\r\nmay be seen in such a country as Dahome, whose subjects hold their lands\r\non royal sufferance, is an extreme case. In the East, feudal tenures of\r\nland granted for military service still have much the same results as in\r\nmediæval Europe.\r\n\r\nAt low levels of civilisation the first dawning of criminal law may be\r\nseen in the rule of vengeance or retaliation. The person aggrieved, or\r\nhis kinsfolk if he has been killed, are at once judges and executioners,\r\nand the vengeance they inflict stands in some reasonable relation to\r\nthe offence committed. Not only is such vengeance the great means of\r\nkeeping order among such rude tribes as the Australians, but even among\r\nhalf-civilised nations like Abyssinians and Afghans the primitive law may\r\nstill be studied in force, carried out in strict legal order as a _lex\r\ntalionis_, not degraded to mere illegal survival in outlying districts\r\nlike the “vendetta” of modern Europe, carried on even now, in spite of\r\ncriminal jurisprudence, which for ages has striven to transfer punishment\r\nfrom private hands to the State. Whether among savages, barbarians, or\r\nthe lower civilised nations, the traveller will find everywhere matter\r\nof interesting observation in the law and its administration. The law\r\nmay be still in the state of unwritten custom, and the senate or council\r\nof old men may be the judges, or the power at once of lawgiver and judge\r\nmay have passed into the hands of the chief, who, as among the modern\r\nKaffirs, may make a handsome revenue by the cattle given him as fees\r\nby both sides, a fact interesting as illustrating the times when an\r\nEuropean judge took gifts as a matter of course. Among the nations at\r\nhigher levels of culture in the East, for instance, most of the stages\r\nmay still be seen through which the administration of law, criminal and\r\ncivil, was given over to a trained legal class. One important stage in\r\nhistory is marked by religion taking to itself legal control over the\r\nconduct of a nation. The working of this is seen among Oriental nations,\r\nwhether Mohammedan, Brahman, or Buddhist, whose codes of law are of an\r\necclesiastical type, and the lawyers theologians. There is much to\r\nbe learnt from the manner in which such law is administered, and the\r\ndevices are interesting by which codes framed under past conditions of\r\nsociety are practically accommodated to a new order of things, without\r\nprofessedly violating laws held to be sacred, and therefore unchangeable.\r\nOrdeals, which have now disappeared from legal procedure among European\r\nnations, are often to be met with elsewhere. Thus in Arabia the ordeal by\r\ntouching or licking hot iron is still known (the latter is an easy and\r\nharmless trick, if the iron is quite white-hot). In Burma, under native\r\nrule, the ancient trial of witches by “swimming” went on till lately. In\r\nmany countries also symbolic oaths invoking evils on the perjurer are\r\nto be met with, as when the Ostyaks in Siberia swear in court by laying\r\ntheir hand on a bear’s head, meaning that a bear will kill them if they\r\nlie. It shows the carelessness with which Europeans are apt to regard the\r\ncustoms of other nations, that in English courts a Chinese is called upon\r\nto swear by breaking a saucer, under the entirely erroneous belief that\r\nthis symbolic curse is a Chinese judicial oath.\r\n\r\nThe most undeveloped forms of government are only to be met with in a few\r\noutlying regions, as among some of the lower Esquimaux or Rocky Mountain\r\ntribes, where life goes on with hardly any rule beyond such control as\r\nthe strong man may have over his own household. Much oftener travellers\r\nhave opportunity of studying, in a more or less crude state, the types of\r\ngovernment which prevail in higher culture. It is of especial interest to\r\nsee men of the whole tribe gathered in assembly (the primitive _agora_)\r\nto decide some question of war or migration. Not less instructive are\r\nthe proceedings of the council of old men (the primitive _senate_), who,\r\namong American tribes or the hill tribes of India, transact the business\r\nof the tribe; they are represented at a later social stage by the\r\nvillage-elders of the Hindus or the Russians. Among the problems which\r\npresent themselves among nations below the civilised level is that of the\r\nworking of the patriarchal system, still prevailing among such tribes as\r\nthe Bedaween, while often the balance of power is seen adjusting itself\r\nbetween the patriarchal heads of families and the leaders who obtain\r\nauthority by success in war. The struggle between the hereditary chief\r\nor king and the military despot, who not only usurps his place but seeks\r\nto establish hereditary monarchy in his own line, is one met with from\r\nlow to high levels of national life. The traveller’s attention may be\r\ncalled to the social forces which do their work independently of men in\r\nauthority, and make society possible, even when there is little visible\r\nauthority at all. The machinery of government described in books is often\r\nmuch less really powerful than public opinion, which controls men’s\r\nconduct in ways which are so much less conspicuous that they have hardly\r\nyet been investigated with the care they deserve.\r\n\r\n_Religion and Mythology._—While great religions, like Mohammedanism and\r\nBuddhism, have been so carefully examined that European students often\r\nknow more about their sacred books than the believers themselves, yet the\r\ngeneral investigation of the religions of the world is very imperfect,\r\nand every effort should be made to save the details from being lost\r\nas one tribe after another disappears, or passes into a new belief.\r\nMissionaries have done much in recording particulars of native religions,\r\nand some have had the skill to describe them scientifically; but the\r\npoint of view of the missionary engaged in conversion to another faith\r\nis unfavourable for seeing the reasons of the beliefs and practices he\r\nis striving to upset. The object of the anthropologist is neither to\r\nattack nor defend the doctrines of the religion he is examining, but to\r\ntrace their rational origin and development. It is not only among the\r\nrudest tribes that religious ideas which seem of a primitive order may be\r\nmet with, but these hold their place also among the higher nations who\r\nprofess a “book-religion.” Thus the English or German peasant retains\r\nmany ideas belonging to the ancestral religion of Thor and Woden, and the\r\nmodern Burmese, though a Buddhist, carries on much of the old worship of\r\nthe spirits of the house and the forest, which belong to a far earlier\r\nreligious stratum than Buddhism. It is in many districts possible for\r\nthe traveller to obtain at first hand interesting information as to the\r\nphilosophical ideas which underlie all religions. All over the world,\r\npeople may be met with whose conception of soul or spirit is that\r\nbelonging to primitive animism, namely, that the life or soul of men,\r\nbeasts, or things, resides in the phantoms of them seen in dreams and\r\nvisions. A traveller in British Guiana had serious trouble with one of\r\nhis Arawaks, who, having dreamt that another had spoken impudently to\r\nhim, on waking up went quite naturally to his master to get the offender\r\npunished. So it is reported that our officials in Burma have considered\r\nthemselves disrespectfully treated when the wife or servant of the person\r\nthey have come to see has refused to wake him, the Englishman not\r\nunderstanding that these people hold early animistic ideas, believing\r\nthe soul to be away from the sleeper’s body in a dream, so that it\r\nmight not find its way back if he were disturbed. As scientific ideas\r\nof the nature of life and dreams are rapidly destroying these primitive\r\nconceptions, it is desirable to collect all information about them for\r\nits important bearing on the history of philosophy and religion. The same\r\nmay be said as to the ancient theory of diseases as caused by demons, and\r\nthe expulsion and exorcism of them as a means of cure, which may still\r\nbe studied everywhere outside the scientific nations. Information as to\r\nreligious rites is of course valuable, even when the foreign observer\r\ndoes not understand them, but if possible their exact meaning should be\r\nmade out by some one acquainted with the language, otherwise acts may\r\nbe confused which have really different senses, as where a morsel of\r\nfood offered as a pious offering to an ancestral ghost may be taken for\r\na sacrifice to appease an angry wood-demon. A people’s idea as to the\r\nmeaning of their own rites may often be very wrong, but it is always\r\nworth while to hear what they think of the purpose of their prayers,\r\nsacrifices, purifications, fasts, feasts, and other religious ordinances,\r\nwhich even among savage tribes have been long since stereotyped into\r\ntraditional systems.\r\n\r\nMythology is intimately mixed up with religion, which not only ascribes\r\nthe events of the world to the action of spirits, demons, or gods, but\r\neverywhere individualises many of these beings under personal names,\r\nand receives as sacred tradition wonder-tales about them. Thus, to\r\nunderstand the religion of some tribes, we have not only to consider the\r\nrude philosophy under which such objects as heaven and earth or sun and\r\nmoon are regarded as personal beings, whose souls (so to speak) are the\r\nheaven-god and earth-god, the sun-god and moon-god; but we have to go\r\non further and collect the religious myths which have grown on to these\r\nsuperhuman beings. The tales which such a people tell of their origin and\r\npast history may to some extent include traditions of real events, but\r\nmostly they consist of myths, which are also worth collecting, as they\r\noften on examination disclose their origin, or part of it. This is seen,\r\nfor instance, in the South Sea Island tale of the god Maui, whose death,\r\nwhen he plunged into the body of his great ancestress the Night, is an\r\nobvious myth of the sunset. The best advice as to native mythology is to\r\nwrite down all promising native stories, leaving it to future examination\r\nto decide which are worth publishing. The native names of personages\r\noccurring in such stories should be inquired into, as they sometimes\r\ncarry in themselves the explanation of the story itself, like the name of\r\nGreat-Woman-Night in the Polynesian myth just referred to. Riddles are\r\nsometimes interesting, as being myths with an explanation attached, like\r\nthe Greek riddle of the twelve black and twelve white horses that draw\r\nthe chariot of the day. It is not too much to say that everything which a\r\npeople thinks worth remembering as a popular tradition, and all the more\r\nif it is fixed in rhyme or verse, is worth notice, as likely to contain\r\nsomething of historical value. That it may not be historically true is\r\nbeside the question, for the poetic fictions of a tribe often throw more\r\nlight on their history than their recollections of petty chiefs who\r\nquarrelled fifty years ago. The myths may record some old custom or keep\r\nup some old word that has died out of ordinary talk, or the very fact of\r\ntheir containing a story known elsewhere in the world may give a clue to\r\nforgotten intercourse by which it was learnt.\r\n\r\n_Customs._—It remains to say a few words as to the multifarious customs\r\nwhich will come under the traveller’s observation. It does not follow\r\nthat because these may be mentioned or described in books they need\r\nnot be further looked into. The fact is that accurate examination in\r\nsuch matters is so new, that something always remains to be made out,\r\nespecially as the motives of so many customs are still obscure. The\r\npractice of artificially deforming the infant’s skull into a desired\r\nshape, which is not quite forgotten even in Europe, may be noticed with\r\nrespect to the question whether the form to which the child’s head is\r\nbulged or flattened is the exaggeration of the natural form of an admired\r\ncaste or race. If not, what can, for instance, have induced two British\r\nColumbian tribes, one to flatten their foreheads and the other to mould\r\nthem up to a peak? In tattooing, an even more widespread practice, it\r\nis well to ascertain whether the pattern on the skin seems to have been\r\noriginally tribe-marks or other signs or records, or whether the purpose\r\nis ornament. In South-East Asia the two motives are present at once, when\r\na man has ornamental designs and magical charm-figures together on his\r\nbody. With regard to ornaments and costumes, the keeping-up of ancient\r\npatterns for ceremonial purposes often affords curious historical hints.\r\nThus in the Eastern Archipelago, the old-fashioned garments of bark-cloth\r\nare used in mourning by people who have long discarded them in ordinary\r\nwear, and another case is found among some natives of South India, whose\r\nwomen, though they no longer put on an apron of leaves as their real\r\nordinary garment, wear it over a cotton skirt on festival-days. Among\r\nthe amusements of a people, songs are often interesting musically, and\r\nit is well to take them down, not only for the tunes, but also for the\r\nwords, which sometimes throw light on old traditions and beliefs. Dancing\r\nvaries from spontaneous expression of emotion to complex figures handed\r\ndown by tradition and forming part of social and religious ceremony. The\r\nnumber of popular games in the world is smaller than would be supposed.\r\nWhen really attractive they may be adopted from one people to another\r\ntill they make their way round the world. Any special variety, as of ball\r\nor draughts, should therefore be noticed, as it may furnish evidence of\r\nintercourse by which it may have come from some distant nation.\r\n\r\nThough the subjects of anthropological interest are not even fully\r\nenumerated in the present chapter, some idea may have been given of\r\nthe field of observation still open to travellers, not only in remote\r\ncountries, but even in Europe. In taking notes, the explorer may be\r\nrecommended not to be afraid of tedious minuteness, whereas the lively\r\nsuperficiality of popular books of travel makes them almost worthless for\r\nanthropology.[15]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn looking through the above remarks, written some years since,\r\nalteration has seemed hardly needful. The writer thinks, however, that\r\nit may be useful to call attention to the increased opportunities of\r\ntravellers to study and obtain implements of the rudest and most ancient\r\nStone Age. Up to a few years ago they could only have expected to\r\nfind proof of the recent use among savages of stone hatchets, knives,\r\narrow-heads, etc., such as in Europe are relics of ancient tribes. These,\r\nindeed, have been known for more than a generation not to be the oldest\r\nrelics of the kind, but have been called neolithic or of the New-Stone\r\nAge, to distinguish them from the far older and lower types of the\r\nmammoth period, called palæolithic or of the Old-Stone Age. Implements\r\nof this class, after their discovery in Europe, were soon noticed in\r\nIndia, and are now especially recognised as found over a great part\r\nof Africa. Of later years, in the islands of the South Pacific, stone\r\nimplements of an even lower class have not only been found in the ground,\r\nbut there is evidence that they had remained in use into modern times.\r\nIn Tasmania it is on record from European eye-witnesses that tools made\r\nfrom chips of hard stone by trimming to an edge on one side, and which\r\nwere grasped in the hand without any handle, were the cutting and hacking\r\ninstruments of the natives into the last century, almost up to the time\r\nof their extinction. Thus apparently the oldest known phase of human\r\nlife endured in this region untouched by civilisation, and travellers\r\nhave the opportunity of studying its recent relics in Tasmania, while\r\nsimilar traces of rude Stone Age life, though not reaching up to so\r\nlate a time, are making their appearance both in West Australia and New\r\nZealand. Travellers should be careful to consider whether chipping is\r\nreally artificial, and not due to natural action of water or wind-blown\r\nsand. There is no doubt that many “implements” in our museums are freaks\r\nof nature, _e.g._, those found in such quantities in the desert plateaux\r\nabove the lower Nile.\r\n\r\nTravellers of the present day have still opportunities of observation in\r\nthe history of culture which will have disappeared in another generation.\r\nInquiry in outlying countries should be made for the vanishing survivals\r\nof arts and customs, stories, and even languages. In Europe there is much\r\nof this kind to be met with by the inquirer, especially off the beaten\r\ntrack. Thus the dug-out canoe, the monoxyle of Hippokrates, need not be\r\nsought on African lakes, for it is still the fisherman’s craft of Hungary\r\nand Bosnia; and in the same region the apparatus for producing the\r\nceremonial need-fire by friction of wood, which disappeared from Scotland\r\ntowards the beginning of last century, and the “whithorn” of coiled bark,\r\nthe rustic musical instrument just vanishing from English peasant life,\r\nare still in ceremonial use. As for savage tribes which come within\r\nthe traveller’s ken, though their stone implements have been mostly\r\nsuperseded by the white man’s cutlery, many arts of the remote past may\r\nstill be seen. The yet simpler means of producing fire by drilling a\r\nstick with the hands without further mechanical adaptation may still be\r\nseen among savages who have not lost their old arts, and the twisting of\r\nthread with the hands, which preceded the use of even the spindle, is\r\nnot everywhere forgotten. Though the study of the religion and folk-lore\r\nof the savage and barbaric world must be left to those who are residents\r\nrather than visitors, the passer-by who inquires may see primitive rites\r\nof religion or magic. Thus in many an Indian house in Arizona or New\r\nMexico the traveller is reminded of his classic recollections when he\r\nsees the first morsel of the meal thrown into the fire as an offering to\r\nthe ancestral spirits.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE BY PROFESSOR R. R. MARETT.\r\n\r\n‘Although Sir Edward Tylor’s summary account of the task of the field\r\nanthropologist was written many years ago, and is now reproduced in a\r\nsubstantially unaltered form, one can confidently recommend it as still\r\nadequate to the needs of a rapidly progressing science. The general plan\r\nof campaign, so brilliantly sketched here, remains much the same. On the\r\nother hand, the traveller in these latter days, instead of opening up\r\nfresh fields, must for the most part be content to work over old ground\r\nmore carefully than his predecessors. Unless, therefore, he is prepared\r\nto discard superficial modes of observation and devote himself to a\r\ncritical and intensive study of the available facts, he had much better\r\nleave the subject alone. It will help greatly if he has been through a\r\ncourse of special training, such as several of the leading Universities\r\ncan nowadays provide.’—R. R.

DUCKWORTH, M.D., SC.D., M.A._\r\n\r\nThe following notes deal in the briefest possible manner with the more\r\nimportant observations to be made on human bones; and it is conceivable\r\nthat some such records might be obtained under circumstances precluding\r\nthe observer from securing or removing the actual specimens, and even\r\nin instances where only a very brief period is available for inspecting\r\nthem. It is convenient to arrange the observations under the following\r\nseparate headings:—\r\n\r\n1. The circumstances attending the death of the individual should be\r\nfirst investigated, and observations concerning the mode and locality\r\nof interment should be recorded (cf. Professor Tylor’s Schedule, under\r\n‘Funeral Rites’).\r\n\r\n2. The general condition of the specimen next demands attention. This is\r\nto some extent dependent upon circumstances referred to in the preceding\r\nsection. From the texture and preservation of the actual bony substance,\r\na rough estimate may be formed as to the lapse of time since the death\r\nof the individual. The occurrence of the skull alone, or at a distance\r\nfrom the remainder of the skeleton, should be noted.\r\n\r\n3. The greater weight and size, as well as the greater prominence of the\r\nbrow-ridges and ridges at the back of the skull, serve to distinguish\r\nthe male _sex_, but in many cases the determination of sex is almost\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nAs regards _age_, skulls are conveniently described as immature, adult or\r\nsenile. Immature skulls lack the full complement of teeth or of sockets\r\nfor these, and a deep cleft is seen to cross the base of the skull about\r\nan inch in front of the large hole (foramen magnum) for the spinal cord.\r\nUpon the attainment of maturity this cleft is obliterated, by the fusion\r\nof its margins. In senile crania, the sutural lines on the surface are\r\nalmost entirely obliterated, and the jaws are toothless and much reduced\r\nin size and prominence.\r\n\r\n4. The skull may be deformed. It is important to attempt to distinguish\r\n_deformation_ produced during life (either artificially or otherwise)\r\nfrom that determined by the weight of superincumbent soil after\r\ninterment. Artificial deformation is manifested in most cases by\r\nflattening of the forehead, or of the back of the skull, or of both. But\r\nposthumous deformation is quite irregular, the face is often involved as\r\nwell as the brain-case, there is often extreme flattening from side to\r\nside, and the bones are usually fragile and tend to fall apart.\r\n\r\n5. _Trephine-holes_, indicative of enterprise in operative surgery,\r\nshould be noted. The regularity of contour and the size of the hole\r\noften gives the clue to its real nature. It must be remembered\r\nthat, in the process of exhumation, injuries closely resembling the\r\nforegoing operative wounds may be received by skulls, and therefore\r\nthe circumstances of exhumation demand enquiry in this connection.\r\nSome skulls are found to have been incised or engraved with decorative\r\npatterns after death.\r\n\r\n6. _Craniological descriptions_ deal with the appearances presented by\r\nskulls in each of the five normal positions or aspects depicted in Fig. 1.\r\n\r\nIn the first view or aspect (Fig. 1, B) the general form of the skull\r\nis shewn, and in proportions the cranial case may be either elongated\r\nor rotund; or again, if elongated, it may be elliptical (with no great\r\ndifference in form between front and back), ovoid (when the hinder end is\r\nthe broader), or rhomboid (lozenge or diamond-shaped).\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 1, C, the profile line, and its modification by prominent\r\nbrow-ridges or jaws, claims attention. In Fig. 1, D, the general form\r\nof the eye (orbital aperture) and nose (nasal aperture), as well as\r\nthe relative breadth of the face, are considered. Fig. 1, E, shows the\r\npalate, and the number and forms of the teeth are studied from this\r\npoint of view. In Fig. 1, A, the form of the transverse cranial arc, and\r\nany irregularities, such as flattening or the production of a keeled\r\n(scaphoid) appearance, should be noted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.\r\n\r\nThe five normæ, or aspects of the human skull, viz.:—(B) Norma\r\nverticalis, the vertex view; (C) Norma lateralis; (D) Norma facialis; (E)\r\nNorma basilaris; (A) Norma occipitalis.]\r\n\r\n7. The _lower jaw_ is studied independently. The prominence of the chin,\r\nthe squareness of the angle, the stoutness of the whole bone, and\r\nthe number and characters of the teeth are the chief points to which\r\nattention is directed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.—Measurement of the length of the skull with\r\ncallipers (Flower’s Craniometer as modified by Dr. Duckworth).\r\n\r\nFIG. 3.—Measurement of the length of the skull with another form of\r\ncallipers.]\r\n\r\n8. _Cranial measurements_ are made with callipers and a flexible steel or\r\ntape measure. These objects, as well as a graduated two-meter rod used\r\nfor measuring stature or long bones, are supplied in a travelling case\r\nby Messrs. Hermann of Zürich, who have made them to Professor Martin’s\r\ndesigns. The whole outfit costs about £4, but the instruments can be\r\nobtained separately. Messrs. Hermann also make a modified form of the\r\ncallipers, known as Flower’s Craniometer (cf. Fig. 2). Measurements\r\nare recorded in millimeters, in which the various callipers, etc., are\r\ngraduated. The latter instruments may have the forms represented in\r\nFig. 2 (Flower’s Craniometer) or Fig. 3, in which are shown the exact\r\npositions of the instruments in measuring the length of the skull.\r\n\r\nThe chief measurements may be now enumerated in order of importance:—\r\n\r\n    i. The _extreme length_ of the brain-case, measured as shown in\r\n    Figs. 2 and 3.\r\n\r\n    ii. The _maximum breadth_ of the skull is measured on the\r\n    brain-case.\r\n\r\n    iii. The _circumference_ of the brain-case (as distinct from\r\n    the face) is measured with the flexible tape passed round the\r\n    brow-ridges and the back of the skull. The measurement is that\r\n    of the greatest circumference of the brain-case obtainable in\r\n    this way.\r\n\r\n    iv. Measurements illustrative of the degree of prominence\r\n    of the upper jaw are two in number, and are made with the\r\n    callipers. The two measurements start from the same point\r\n    behind; this point is the middle of the front edge, or margin,\r\n    of the hole for the spinal cord (foramen magnum), shown in\r\n    Fig. 1, E. From this common point, the upper or _basi-nasal\r\n    measurement_ passes to the upper border of the nasal bones in\r\n    the middle line of the face, and the lower or _basi-alveolar\r\n    measurement_ passes to the extreme front edge of the upper jaw\r\n    in the middle line, just above and between the upper incisor\r\n    teeth.\r\n\r\n9. _Measurements of the long bones_ of the limbs. These are best made\r\nby means of a graduated rod with fixed and movable limbs, resembling a\r\nlarge pair of callipers. Such a rod is supplied (as indicated above) by\r\nMessrs. Hermann. The bones to be measured are six in number for each side\r\nof the body, viz.:—those of the upper arm and thigh (humerus and femur);\r\nthen two for the forearm (called radius and ulna, the former being the\r\nshorter); and two for the leg (called tibia and fibula, the former, or\r\nshin-bone, being the larger). The extreme or maximum length is measured\r\nin each case, excepting those of the femur and tibia.\r\n\r\n    i. The femur is measured obliquely, that is, from its ball-like\r\n    head to a line touching _both_ prominences at the lower end, as\r\n    shown at B in Fig. 4. This represents the position of the bone\r\n    in a person standing erect.\r\n\r\n    ii. The spiny processes on the upper end of the tibia are not\r\n    included in the measurement of its length.\r\n\r\nImmature limb-bones are recognised by the line which demarcates the\r\nextreme ends, or epiphyses, from the shaft (or diaphysis). Sexual\r\ndifferences are chiefly indicated by greater length, stoutness, and also\r\nby the development of osseous ridges in male bones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.—Position of the thigh-bone for measurement of its\r\nlength.]\r\n\r\n10. The measurements of the long bones are used in estimating the\r\n_stature_. Special notice is to be paid to individuals of giant or of\r\ndwarf stature. In this connection particular mention should be made in\r\nthe following instances:—\r\n\r\n    (_a_) Where the thigh bone measures more than 52 cm., or less\r\n    than 36 cm.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) Where the shin bone measures more than 42 cm., or less\r\n    than 28 cm.\r\n\r\n    (_c_) Where the fibula measures more than 41 cm., or less than\r\n    28 cm.\r\n\r\n    (_d_) Where the upper arm bone measures more than 37 cm., or\r\n    less than 26 cm.\r\n\r\n    (_e_) Where the ulna measures more than 29 cm., or less than 20\r\n    cm.\r\n\r\n    (_f_) Where the radius measures more than 27 cm., or less than\r\n    19 cm. (only adult bones being considered, and the sex, where\r\n    known, recorded).\r\n\r\n11. Adult skulls will also excite attention when the horizontal\r\ncircumference (measured in accordance with the directions provided above)\r\nis greater than 56 cm., or less than 47 cm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nINDUSTRY AND COMMERCE.[16]\r\n\r\n_By SIR JOHN SCOTT KELTIE, LL.D., formerly Secretary, R.G.S._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe kind of information desired under this heading may be summed up in\r\nthe three following questions, so far as uncivilised or semi-civilised\r\ncountries are concerned:—\r\n\r\n    (1.) What are the available resources of the country that may\r\n    be turned to industrial or commercial account?\r\n\r\n    (2.) What commercial products can find an available market in\r\n    the country?\r\n\r\n    (3.) What are the facilities for or hindrances to intercourse\r\n    between the country and the rest of the world?\r\n\r\n    Or, briefly, (1) Resources; (2) Wants; (3) Accessibility.\r\n\r\nThese include the questions of suitability for immigration and\r\ncolonisation.\r\n\r\nWhat is known as commercial geography is one of several special\r\napplications of geographical knowledge. From this practical point of\r\nview, therefore, the observations collected under other heads in this\r\nbook will be of service, especially if the requirements of commerce\r\nare kept in view at the same time as the _desiderata_ of science. From\r\nthis standpoint, the sections on Meteorology, Geology, Natural History,\r\nand Anthropology should be consulted. Even general geographical and\r\ntopographical observations will be of practical service—the general lie\r\nof the country, its altitudes, and its character at certain altitudes,\r\nits mountains, hills, valleys, plains, rivers—if regarded from the\r\nspecial standpoint of habitability and possibilities of development.\r\n\r\nThe suggestions contained in this, as in the other sections of this\r\nmanual, are meant both for the ordinary explorer or traveller who may\r\nhave to pass rapidly through a country and for those who may have\r\nmore opportunity for making leisurely observations. To the former the\r\nfollowing brief hints may prove serviceable:—\r\n\r\nObserve and note—\r\n\r\n    1. As regards RESOURCES:—\r\n\r\n    The extent or quantity, quality, facilities for raising or\r\n    collecting, for transport and shipment, etc., of\r\n\r\n    (_a_) The natural products, such as minerals and metals,\r\n    especially gold, silver, coal, iron, copper, tin, nitre,\r\n    guano, phosphates, etc.; timber useful for various purposes;\r\n    vegetable products, useful for food, fibres, dye-stuffs, or\r\n    medicine—gums, resins, etc.; animal products useful for food,\r\n    skins, fur, feathers; riverine or lacustrine products, useful\r\n    for food, oil, or other purposes.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) Substances cultivated for food or for manufacturing\r\n    purposes.\r\n\r\n    (_c_) Articles manufactured for clothing, for domestic,\r\n    warlike, or other purposes.\r\n\r\n    (_d_) Native methods of developing resources, of carrying on\r\n    manufactures, and of transport.\r\n\r\n    (_e_) Practicability of developing the resources of the country\r\n    by European methods.\r\n\r\n    2. As to WANTS:—\r\n\r\n    (_a_) What particular things used by the natives could be\r\n    profitably supplied from the outside?\r\n\r\n    (_b_) What do the natives lack that might be introduced and\r\n    supplied from the outside?\r\n\r\n    (_c_) In all cases be particular to note favourite materials,\r\n    shapes, colours, or other peculiarities, as of cloths,\r\n    implements, ornaments, such as beads, anklets, etc.\r\n\r\n    3. As to ACCESSIBILITY:—\r\n\r\n    Note the nearest ports and railways; the character and\r\n    connections of native roads, if any; the navigability of\r\n    rivers, inlets and lakes for various kinds of craft at various\r\n    seasons of the year; heights of passes, whether suitable for\r\n    animals or only for porters, whether blocked at any season of\r\n    year; routes likely to be suitable for railways.\r\n\r\nIn all cases where practicable, specimens of products should be obtained,\r\nin order that specialists at home may judge of their industrial or\r\ncommercial value.\r\n\r\nFor those who may have more leisure for observation, some or all of the\r\nfollowing detailed hints may be useful:—\r\n\r\nMINERALS AND METALS.—It is not necessary to add much here to what has\r\nbeen said under Geology. If the traveller is not himself competent, or\r\nhas no opportunity to test the value of these products, he should bring\r\nhome specimens; this, if possible, should be done in any case. Under this\r\nsection a look-out should be kept for any indication of naphtha, asphalt,\r\nor mineral oils. From the commercial point of view the important points\r\nare—\r\n\r\n_Quality._—To what extent are minerals or metals, as gold, copper, iron,\r\nphosphates, mixed up with other matter? What is the yield per ton of ore?\r\nIn the case of coal, how does it burn, and what is the percentage of ash?\r\nNext—\r\n\r\n_Quantity._—Does the substance occur in sufficient quantity to make it\r\nworth expenditure of capital and labour? The information must be obtained\r\nby personal inspection. Finally—\r\n\r\n_Locality._—Is the situation of the deposits easily accessible? How are\r\nthey situated with reference to routes, existing or practicable? and how\r\nwith reference to ports of embarkation? Could they be worked with the\r\nresources available in the country, or would labour and machinery require\r\nto be introduced? If worked in the country, is there any neighbouring\r\nmarket for the manufactured products? What are the native processes (if\r\nany) of obtaining and working minerals?\r\n\r\nWe must again refer to the section on Geology for further details, and\r\nthe intending traveller would do well to take a few lessons before he\r\nleaves, so as to be able to recognise the most common and useful minerals\r\nand the conditions under which they usually occur; he will thus save much\r\ntime and trouble.\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE PRODUCTS.—The directions for observation and collection given\r\nunder the Botanical section should be attended to; and it is important\r\nthat the traveller should be able to recognise the chief classes of\r\nplants, so that specialists may be able to pronounce generally on their\r\nutility.\r\n\r\n_Character of Surface._—The general character of the surface of a\r\ncountry, so far as its vegetation is concerned, should be clearly\r\ngrasped. What proportion, or, if possible, what area is under forest?\r\nwhat under grass? what desert, or mountain, or marsh, or uncultivable?\r\nwhat under cultivation?\r\n\r\n_Forests._—If of a generally forest or thickly-wooded character, are\r\nthe forests extensive and dense, with much undergrowth, as in tropical\r\nSouth America? or easily penetrable, as the forests of Europe and North\r\nAmerica? Or are the trees scattered, either in clumps, or singly, as in a\r\ngreat part of Central Africa? Do they prevail over the country generally,\r\nor are the river-banks only lined with dense tree vegetation? Are the\r\nforests only found in the low country, or do they cover the hills and\r\nextend up the mountains?\r\n\r\n_Timber._—Ascertain the leading characteristics of the trees of the\r\nforests. What are the prevailing families, and, if possible, genera and\r\nspecies? What uses, if any, do the natives make of the woods? Which\r\ndo they use for their houses, their furniture, their canoes, their\r\nweapons, their ornaments? How do the woods seem to stand tear and wear,\r\nthe climate, the attack of destructive insects, immersion in water? Are\r\nthere any woods that would do for such purposes as railway-sleepers or\r\ntelegraph-poles in the conditions which prevail in the country? Any\r\nornamental woods suitable for cabinet purposes?\r\n\r\n_Fibres, Fruits, Chemicals, etc._—Are there any plants the fibres\r\nof which could be turned to account? Any fruits adapted to human\r\nconsumption, and are they found in any quantity, or could they be\r\ncultivated?\r\n\r\nAre there any trees or other plants suitable for drugs or chemicals—bark,\r\nleaves, juices, roots? What medicines, narcotics, or stimulants are used\r\nby the natives? how are they obtained and how prepared?\r\n\r\nAre there any species of useful plants growing wild—coffee, sugar,\r\ncotton, vanilla, spices, etc.? Any trees producing gums that might be\r\nof commercial value, like gum arabic, gutta-percha, or caoutchouc? Or\r\nany whose fruits yield oil, like the cocoa-nut and the olive? Do the\r\nnatives make use of these juices? What are the processes of extraction\r\nand preparation?\r\n\r\n_Other Vegetation._—When there is an undergrowth, its character should be\r\nnoticed, and the diseases, if any, to which trees are subject.\r\n\r\nNote what other vegetation exists besides that of trees. Are there any\r\nplants like the turnip, the potato, the batata, which are useful as\r\nfoods, or for other purposes? Specimens of any herbs likely to be useful\r\nshould be obtained, especially if they are used by the natives for\r\nmedicine, for dyeing, for poison, or other useful purposes.\r\n\r\nSometimes, as in Central and Western Australia, what arboraceous\r\nvegetation exists consists mainly of shrubs, the character of which\r\nshould be noted. Do they hinder locomotion? Are their shoots useful for\r\nforage? Are they injurious to horses and cattle?\r\n\r\nWhen there is herbaceous vegetation of any extent, what is its character?\r\nIs it tall and coarse and reedy, like much of the African grass? Or such\r\nas is found on the prairies and pampas? Or of a troublesome spinifex\r\ncharacter, as in Australia? Or of a turf-like character, like the grasses\r\nof Europe? What are the components of this kind of vegetation, and how\r\nfar is it likely to prove useful as fodder? What uses do the natives put\r\nit to, either for their animals or for manufactures? Do they use it for\r\nmaking mats or cloth? Are there any plants mixed with it injurious to\r\nanimals? What is the condition of the grass at different seasons of the\r\nyear? When is it at its best, its strongest, its densest? Is it liable\r\nto be parched up at any season? To what extent is its condition affected\r\nby the climate, by rainfall, by irrigation, natural or artificial? Is it\r\neasily removed, in order to make way for other cultures? Does it spread\r\ninto the forest region, and has it any special characteristics there? How\r\ndoes it, as well as other useful vegetation, vary with altitude or other\r\nlocal conditions? Do the products change under different agricultural\r\nconditions? e.g., some are poisonous under certain conditions, not others?\r\n\r\n_Marshes, Deserts, Irrigation._—Note if marshes or peat-bogs, or other\r\nspecial features of the surface exist to any extent, and whether the\r\ndrainage of marshes is practicable.\r\n\r\nWhere deserts exist, note their character. Are they sandy, gravelly,\r\nrocky, salt? What is the prevailing rock? If the desert character of the\r\nland (as is generally the case) seems due to want of water, is there any\r\nartificial means likely to be available for supplying that want? Is there\r\nany storage of water and irrigation among the natives? and, if so, how is\r\nit accomplished? and what are the results? Are there any sources within\r\nreach, either above or underground, from whence a supply of water for\r\nirrigation purposes could be obtained? Indicate any exceptional defects\r\nof quality in the supply of water.\r\n\r\nNote if any part of the country is liable to periodical inundations.\r\nAt what periods of the year do they occur? Are these inundations\r\ndestructive, or are they utilised for agricultural purposes? Would it be\r\npossible to regulate these inundations?\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURE.—The general outcome of all these observations is the\r\nsuitability of a country for agricultural development. What articles\r\ndo the natives cultivate, if any? Has the cultivated land any special\r\ncharacter, or is it simply the ordinary land cleared of trees or grass,\r\nor other wild growth? Note the methods and implements of culture used by\r\nthe natives; the seasons of sowing and reaping, and preparing the crops\r\nfor use. Do they depend for water on rainfall or irrigation? To what\r\naltitudes is cultivation carried, and what are the crops that prosper at\r\nthese altitudes?\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of colonisation and agriculture, precise\r\ninformation as to the nature of the soil is desirable. The proportion or\r\nextent of a country suitable for agriculture might be noted. Observe,\r\nas precisely as practicable, the nature and depth of the upper layer\r\nof soil. The depth—it may be a few inches, or it may be two or three\r\nfeet—can easily be ascertained. A general idea may also be given of its\r\nnature. Is it mostly vegetable mould, as it is likely to be in old forest\r\nor grass countries? or peaty? or marshy? If possible, also, ascertain the\r\ndepth of the subsoil down to the rock or clay, or other permanent basis\r\non which it rests. In a general way it might be observed whether the soil\r\nis sandy, gravelly, stony, calcareous, marly, clayey. Also is it compact,\r\ntenacious, or loose, and, above all, is it permeable or impermeable to\r\nwater? Is the soil very dry or very moist? or what is its intermediate\r\nstage?\r\n\r\nIf the natives carry on cultivation, ascertain, if possible, the yield\r\nper acre of what they cultivate. Do they cultivate only for their own\r\nwants? If not, where and what is the nature of the market to which they\r\nsend the surplus?\r\n\r\nDoes the country seem suitable for other cultures besides those carried\r\non by the natives?\r\n\r\nANIMAL PRODUCTS.—If there are wild animals in the country, observe\r\nwhether the natives hunt them for what they yield in the way of food or\r\nother useful products. Are there any ivory-yielding animals, or animals\r\nwhose skins can be turned to profitable account? Could a sufficient\r\nsupply for mercantile purposes be obtained by means of native hunters,\r\nif properly encouraged; or how would it be best to work such resources?\r\nAre there any laws or customs enforced by the natives in hunting wild\r\nanimals? Are there any noxious wild animals, and to what extent do they\r\naffect human comfort and human life?\r\n\r\n_Domestic Animals._—It is important to know what domestic animals the\r\nnatives possess, how they are reared and fed, and what uses they are\r\nput to. Also whether the country is good for horses, cattle, sheep,\r\nand poultry, and approximately what is the extent, situation, and\r\naccessibility of the grazing-lands. Are the pastures perennial? To what\r\nextent do they depend on rainfall, or irrigation, or on intermittent\r\nstreams? During what months of the year are they available? Are there any\r\nplants among the pastures injurious to animals? Are there any insects\r\n(like the _tsetse_) or other animals injurious to cattle or horses? Do\r\nhorses or asses exist among the natives, and what uses are they put to?\r\nIf not, would they be likely to flourish, if introduced?\r\n\r\n_Fisheries._—Information concerning fish and fisheries is desirable;\r\nand among fish, from the practical standpoint, are included shell-fish\r\n(especially pearl shells), sponges, corals, and animals of the whale and\r\nseal kind. If the natives practise fishing, either in lakes, rivers, or\r\nthe sea, ascertain the kinds of fish they capture, their methods and\r\nimplements, and the particular seasons at which fishing is practised.\r\nAre the fisheries, whether worked by the natives or not, likely to be of\r\ncommercial value?\r\n\r\nTRADE.—Much of the information suggested above will be of service\r\nfrom the special commercial point of view, especially with\r\nreference to export. Information should be obtained concerning any\r\nmanufactures carried on by the natives besides what has been suggested\r\nabove—manufactures in metal, in wood, in clay, or stone; in materials\r\nderived from the vegetable and animal kingdoms, what they are, what\r\nuses they are put to, what processes are used, and to what extent, if\r\nany, they form articles of trade. With regard to the import market,\r\nwhat generally are the wants of the natives and what new wants might\r\nbe created. If possible, some approximate estimate of the value of the\r\nleading classes of imports, if there are any, should be obtained.\r\n\r\nAscertain if any goods are brought into the country from the outside;\r\nif so, what they are, where they come from, and as accurate an estimate\r\nas possible of quantity, or value, or both. In the case of imports from\r\ncivilised countries, are those of any particular country preferred, and,\r\nif so, why? Is it owing to anything special in quality, or pattern, or\r\ncost, means of communication, or in quantity available? Is there any\r\nspecial tribe of middlemen who prevent the inland people from coming\r\ninto direct relation with traders? Probably a market could be created\r\nfor outside manufactures which have not as yet been introduced into the\r\ncountry; or such manufactures might easily obtain a market in preference\r\nto those of native make. Note especially the patterns of articles of\r\nnative make, as these are probably adapted to the conditions of the\r\ncountry, and should therefore be imitated or improved upon in the case\r\nof imported goods, the quality of the latter being better, and the cost,\r\nif possible, lower. British traders, especially, often incur serious\r\nlosses by not ascertaining in advance what particular articles and what\r\nspecial patterns are in demand among natives. Note also whether European\r\nmethods might not be introduced with advantage for the manufacture of\r\nnative goods. Native usages as to credit ought to be ascertained, what\r\nsafeguards are binding, what is the medium of exchange, etc. It would be\r\nuseful to discover beforehand whether the importation of machinery and\r\nexplosives is likely to be unimpeded.\r\n\r\nCLIMATE.—This is an essential item, so far as the exploitation of\r\ntropical and semi-tropical countries by Europeans is concerned. Its\r\nmain elements are determined by temperature, latitude, altitude, and\r\nrainfall; the character of the surface should also be taken into account.\r\nUnder Meteorology, the main directions on the subject are given. The\r\ntemperature at different seasons and at different times of the day (say\r\n9 A.M., 3 P.M., and 9 P.M.) should be ascertained, and that at various\r\naltitudes. Rainfall observations are not of much service unless they can\r\nbe obtained over a continuous series of years. Ascertain the distribution\r\nof rainfall over the year, and the limits of the rainy period of the\r\nyear, when such period exists, and, if possible, the quantity which\r\nfalls in the different months of the period; how does the rainfall differ\r\nwith altitude and other topographical variations? If a country is subject\r\nto droughts, it is important to ascertain if there is any periodicity\r\nin these droughts, and how they affect the resources and prospects of\r\nthe country, and the condition of the rivers. Would it be possible, by\r\nstorage of water or other means, to counteract to any extent the bad\r\neffects of drought?\r\n\r\nWhat effect has the rainy period and the drought period on the native\r\ninhabitants, and especially on Europeans? As far as possible, ascertain\r\nthe birth and death rate per annum.\r\n\r\nFACILITIES AND HINDRANCES TO COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT.—Under this head\r\nthe first consideration is Accessibility or Means of Communication.\r\nGenerally, the quickest, cheapest, and safest routes to a satisfactory\r\nmarket should be ascertained.\r\n\r\n_Water Communication._—Observe what natural means of communication exist,\r\nwhat is the nature of communication between the country and the outside\r\nworld. If communication by sea is of importance, how is the interior to\r\nbe reached from the sea? Are there any deep inlets? Is there practicable\r\nriver communication? For what sort of vessels is it adapted? Are there\r\nany obstructions in the river, and, if so, what is their nature, and how\r\ncould they be surmounted? What is the width of the river, the depth of\r\nthe water, and the force of the current, at various distances from the\r\nmouth, and at the periods of the year when the river is at its lowest and\r\nhighest? Are there any lakes that could be utilised for communication?\r\n\r\n_Roads._—If there are native roads, state precisely what is their\r\nnature under various conditions of weather; their width; what sort of\r\nvehicles, if any, they are suited for, and where they lead to. If the\r\ncountry is mountainous, ascertain the principal passes, what places they\r\nconnect, their exact heights at the highest point (not the heights of\r\nthe mountains), for what animals or vehicles they are practicable, or if\r\nonly for porters, and what is their condition at various seasons of the\r\nyear. If the natives have any vehicles, or vessels, or other means of\r\ntransport, describe them.\r\n\r\n_Railway Routes._—Observe, as far as possible, suitable routes for\r\nrailway or canal communication, as well as for good roads, and whether\r\nany materials for railway construction are obtainable in the country.\r\nPossibly the country, if an inland one, could be connected by road or\r\nrail with some existing railway system. What are the nearest telegraph\r\nstations?\r\n\r\n_Labour._—Another important consideration under this head is that of\r\nlabour—labour for the varied enterprises connected with the development\r\nof a country’s resources. Is labour obtainable within the country itself?\r\nIf so, to what extent, and on what terms? Are the natives industrious,\r\nand are they likely to labour under foreign superintendence? Does slavery\r\nor forced labour in any form exist? If not obtainable in the country, how\r\nmay labour be most easily and cheaply obtained? Is the country suited to\r\nmanual labour by whites? If there are only certain kinds of labour in\r\nwhich whites may engage, state what they are.\r\n\r\nTo what extent could machinery be used with advantage? Is there any water\r\npower available? or any animal power?\r\n\r\n_Currency, Tariffs, etc._—Under this head also questions relating to\r\ncurrency should be included, or whatever other medium of exchange exists.\r\n\r\nAnother important consideration here is the question of tariffs,\r\nwhich, in one shape or another, exist in nearly all uncivilised and\r\nsemi-civilised countries, from the hongo of Central Africa to the Customs\r\nduties of Eastern countries. Precise information concerning these, both\r\nas to exports and imports, is important.\r\n\r\nNote, also, as precisely as practicable, the cost of living for Europeans\r\nsettling down for a time, and the expenses involved in travelling through\r\na country.\r\n\r\n_Inhabitants._—Is there anything in the character of the\r\nnatives—physical, mental, or moral—likely to affect commercial\r\nintercourse or the industrial development of the country? Any prejudices\r\nor superstitions that should be attended to? Anything in the attitude\r\nof natives to traders and settlers deserving consideration? Is the\r\npopulation nomadic or settled? What material, if any, do they use\r\nfor smoking, and what is the nature of their intoxicating drinks, if\r\nthey have any? Estimate, as nearly as possible, the population, the\r\ndensity per square mile, both for the country as a whole and for the\r\nchief centres of population. Ascertain the nature of any political or\r\nsocial organisation which exists. What are the terms on which land can\r\nbe acquired? What are the prevalent crimes? Under the Anthropological\r\nsection directions are given for ascertaining the leading racial\r\ncharacteristics of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nARCHÆOLOGY.\r\n\r\n_By D. G. HOGARTH, C.M.G., M.A., D.LITT._\r\n\r\n\r\nThis section is intended, not for experts, but for those travellers\r\nwithout special interest or experience in archæological work, who,\r\nfinding themselves in districts where unpublished antiquities exist, feel\r\nit incumbent to record or rescue them. General hints, therefore, are\r\nsubjoined on methods of recording, cleaning, temporarily conserving, and\r\nconveying monuments and objects of antiquity.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.—RECORDING.\r\n\r\nThere are three ways of obtaining a record of a monument, all of which\r\nshould be used if possible in cases of importance:—\r\n\r\n1. Mechanical reproduction by photography, moulding, or rubbing.\r\n\r\n2. Reproduction by planning, drawing, or otherwise copying.\r\n\r\n3. Literary memoranda of characteristics, _e.g._, dimensions, subject,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Mechanical Reproduction._\r\n\r\n_(a) Photography._—This subject has already been dealt with in Part II.,\r\nand it is only necessary here to add a few hints, peculiarly applicable\r\nto the photography of objects of antiquity.\r\n\r\n_Of inscriptions_ photography does not, as a rule, supply a useful\r\nreproduction, and unless time or other opportunity be wanting, it should\r\nnot be the only mechanical process applied. If an inscription is at\r\nall worn, or the material on which it is engraved contains superficial\r\nfaults, do not rely on a photograph; but if one is taken, try to dispose\r\nthe object so that light falls on it from one side, with a slight\r\nobliquity from above. In the case of rock inscriptions or others still\r\nin their place on walls, etc., a photograph should be secured to show\r\nrelative position and surroundings. An inscription on dark material will\r\noften need preparation with white chalk before being photographed to any\r\ngood purpose; but the traveller who has opportunity to do that, will\r\nprobably have equal opportunity to employ the better process of moulding.\r\n\r\nFor _sculpture_, photography will often be the only method of\r\nreproduction possible to the traveller. When that is the case he may be\r\nadvised (1) to take his photographs on the largest possible scale; (2)\r\nto take the object from all possible points of view; (3) to do what he\r\ncan to improve the light and relief of the subject. Small objects gain\r\nenormously by reflected lights carefully arranged to bring out their\r\ncontours; if sufficient mirrors are not obtainable, strips of tin or\r\neven white paper will serve as reflectors. Backgrounds may be chalked or\r\nblacked as the case may be, but in the case of a relief this should only\r\nbe done when the outlines are very clear. If a sculpture on rock or other\r\nmaterial is much broken or worn, a good mechanical method of improving\r\nrelief, which Professor Petrie recommends, can be used; this consists in\r\ndusting the face with powdery sand and then fanning it. The result, if\r\ncarefully done, is to leave hollows and background in strong contrast to\r\nthe surface of the relief. Highly polished or lucent surfaces should be\r\ndulled before photographing. Metal objects do not, as a rule, photograph\r\nvery satisfactorily; and of coins it is much better to take a cast and\r\nphotograph that. Perhaps it is not superfluous to remind the photographer\r\nto make notes of all colouring before leaving his subject. On preparing\r\nsculpture, etc., for photography there are valuable practical hints in\r\nProfessor Petrie’s ‘_Methods and Aims in Archæology_,’ Chapter VII.\r\n\r\nFor _small objects of antiquity_, photography is not of much service\r\nunless a camera with very long extension can be used. If it be possible,\r\nthe best way is to lay the objects on a sheet of glass raised about a\r\nfoot from the ground on a frame, and arrange the camera above, so as\r\nto photograph downwards. This process obviates all ground shadows, and\r\nall pins or other supports for the objects, which appear sharply on the\r\nnegative as if suspended in air.\r\n\r\nFor _buildings_ photography is, of course, the only method of mechanical\r\nreproduction possible.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Moulding._—This in almost all cases will have to be done by\r\nimpressing _paper_. Only in the case of small objects will a traveller\r\nordinarily be able to use either _plaster of Paris_ (if he can procure\r\nit) or _sealing wax_. As to the latter he may be reminded never to heat\r\nhis wax by putting it in direct contact with a flame, or the impression\r\nwill come out so parti-coloured or black as to be of little use; a card\r\nshould be held over a candle or lamp, or, better, a spirit burner, and\r\nthe wax rubbed upon the gradually heating upper surface till enough\r\nhas melted on to the card without boiling. A useful impression may be\r\nobtained of coins, gems, etc., by pressing ordinary tin foil upon the\r\nsurface; but great care must be taken afterwards that the impression\r\ndoes not get flattened out in transport. Mr. Petrie recommends floating\r\nimpressed foil on water face downwards, and dropping hot wax upon it, as\r\na solidifying agent.\r\n\r\nAs to the use of plaster of Paris it may be remembered that (1) the\r\nproper mixture is just as much plaster as will absorb the water, leaving\r\nnone standing on the top; (2) the object must be well cleaned and soaped\r\nbefore being moulded; (3) the plaster must be applied _very rapidly_, in\r\na thin coating all over the object at once: it can be backed with more\r\nplaster afterwards; (4) a surface of any size should either be moulded in\r\nsections, or, if done all at once, the plaster will probably have to be\r\ncut into sections afterwards for transport. To cut it, it is best to lay\r\nstrings upon the object before moulding, which, later, can be pulled up\r\nthrough the plaster while still viscous.\r\n\r\n_Paper moulding_ or ‘_squeezing_’ is, however, the ordinary process\r\nemployed. Any fairly strong _unsized_ paper will serve more or less\r\nwell, but a special ‘squeeze’ paper is procurable in most large cities\r\nwhere there are archæological museums (_e.g._, in London, from Nutt’s,\r\n57 to 59, Long Acre, W.C.; in Paris, from Moreau’s, 11, Passage du Pont\r\nNeuf; in Berlin, from Ebers Brothers. It can also be got direct from\r\nthe maker, Papierhändler Dorr, Spiesgasse, Strassburg.) Mr. Maudslay\r\nrecommended in a previous edition a hand-made paper, used for packing\r\noranges in Spain, and to be obtained of Messrs. Batalla, of Cacagente,\r\nnear Valencia, through the agency of Messrs. H. King & Co., Cornhill.\r\nFailing these, the paper on which the commoner news-sheets are printed\r\nwill do. The other implements needed are a sponge, and close-bristled,\r\nnot very hard, brushes of two or three sizes, _e.g._, an ordinary\r\nclothes-brush, a nail-brush, and a tooth-brush, if no others are at hand,\r\nbut special brushes with hand-straps on the back, or curved handles to\r\nkeep the knuckles of the beater away from the stone, are preferable. In\r\nthe case of an ordinary inscription, of not specially rough or uneven\r\nsurface, brush and clean the stone thoroughly, and pick all accumulation\r\nout of the letters; then wet it thoroughly all over; lay the dry paper,\r\ncut to size, as flat on the surface as possible, and dab it down with a\r\nvery wet sponge till thoroughly soaked; take the largest brush and pound\r\nthe paper rather gently all over, till it partially adheres; then take\r\nsmaller brushes and work the paper into all depressions with the maximum\r\npressure you can exert; finally, hammer it with the large brush again,\r\nworking systematically from top to bottom or side to side, not minding\r\nthe surface becoming mashed, and driving the air-bubbles, which collect\r\nunder the paper, before you and out at the farthest point. If the stone\r\nwas thoroughly wetted before the paper was laid on, these ought not\r\nto be numerous or troublesome. Then, if the surface of the stone has\r\npenetrated through the paper at any point, lay a second sheet and, if\r\nnecessary, a third, or more, and treat as the first was treated. Leave\r\nthe sheets, if possible, to dry on the stone, and all will come off as\r\none with a perfect reverse impression of the stone’s surface. Some soak\r\nthe paper before laying on the stone, but if that is done and there be\r\nany wind, the paper, become very tender, will be apt to tear with its own\r\nweight while being laid on, and will be difficult to lay flat. If for\r\nany reason, _e.g._, overhanging of the stone’s face, it is difficult to\r\nmake the paper adhere, the task will prove easier with small pieces. But\r\nwhenever a surface is squeezed by sections, the operator must be careful\r\nto make the edges of his sheets overlap, so that later all can be gummed\r\ntogether as one sheet; to number the sheets according to a key-plan,\r\nrecorded in his note-book, and to mark on the sheets themselves the lines\r\nof junction. All superfluous edges should be peeled off, as they are apt\r\nto lift in the wind and cause all or a part of the impression to become\r\ndetached before it is well set, and weights should, if possible, be laid\r\non the drying paper. If for any reason the paper cannot be left to dry in\r\nposition, peel off carefully and lay out to dry reverse side uppermost.\r\nThe impression, so taken, will be hardly less good. When dry, roll the\r\nsqueeze inside a tin cylinder, and only very rough usage will harm it.\r\n\r\nSqueezing sculptures is a more difficult matter. Mr. A. P. Maudslay gave\r\nvery full directions in an earlier edition of these “Hints” which may be\r\nrepeated here. After stating that all moulds of sculpture have to be made\r\nof many thicknesses of paper, with a good coating of paste between every\r\nfew sheets (not only because of the great inequalities of surface, which\r\nbreak through the paper, but also in order that the mould, when dry, may\r\nbe stout enough to keep its shape), he said:—\r\n\r\n‘Paper can only properly be applied for the purpose of moulding when\r\nthe carving is free from large contours and deep undercutting; but it\r\nis wonderful what accurate results can be obtained even when large\r\ncurves and some undercutting have to be contended against. Where worn\r\nor splintered parts of a wood-carving, or fissures in a stone, or deep\r\nundercutting which is not essential to the design, occur, it is often of\r\nadvantage to fill them up with clay or paper, to which a smooth surface\r\ncan be given, so that the mould will come away free from them when it is\r\ndry; and careful notes and measurements will often enable one to restore\r\nthe contour to a mould which has suffered some pressure in transport. In\r\na properly-made mould the detail of carving is never lost, unless the\r\npaper itself is destroyed.\r\n\r\n‘A shallow tin bath (or two made to fit inside one another), large enough\r\nto hold an open sheet of paper, is useful for soaking the paper in.[17]\r\nTwenty sheets or more may be placed in the water at once, and left there\r\nwithout harm for an hour or more; but a few minutes’ soaking is quite\r\nenough.\r\n\r\n‘I have several times had to mould, in America, the whole of a monolithic\r\nmonument—one as much as 25 feet in height—covered with carving and\r\nhieroglyphic inscription, and have been perfectly successful in\r\nreproducing it in plaster in England. Each face would be marked out into\r\nthree or more sections, and each section would be moulded separately,\r\ngreat care being taken that each mould should considerably overlap the\r\nmargin of the other, so that when each section is cast in plaster the\r\nedges of the cast can be cut away until the joint is perfect. And each\r\nsection should also overlap at the top and sides in No. 1, and at the\r\nsides in No. 2, &c., for the same reason; and it is necessary to pay\r\ncareful attention to the beating in of the paper near the sides and\r\nedges, as it is there that the layers are most likely to come apart when\r\ndry. These edges can be trimmed down afterwards, if found too bulky in\r\npacking.\r\n\r\n‘The first sheets of paper should always be put on singly, and well\r\nbeaten in. If the carving presents many sharp angles, the paper will\r\nagain and again be broken away over them, and small scraps of paper may\r\nbe used for covering them up, until the whole section is covered at least\r\nthree papers deep in the thinnest place. The coat of paste should then\r\nbe given. If the paste is laid on when the mould is too thin, it will\r\npenetrate to the stone, and prevent the mould coming off when dry. The\r\npaste may be put on warm, but if too hot it draws the paper from the\r\nstone (if it is a stone sculpture); air gets underneath the paper, and it\r\nis very difficult to get rid of it again. Avoid, in putting on the first\r\npapers, doubled edges or creases, and beat in well, so that the paper may\r\nwork into the grain of the stone or wood. It is easy to spoil a mould by\r\nscamping the work in it, but not easy to spoil it by overbeating. After\r\ngiving a coat of paste with a brush, it is advisable to work in the paste\r\nwith the fingers, so as to be sure, from the smooth feeling, that it\r\npenetrates the paper over the whole surface.\r\n\r\n‘After the first coat of paste has been applied, a good deal of time\r\nmay be saved by employing an assistant to beat out the paper for the\r\nfurther thickening of the mould, for when thus beaten out, two or three\r\nthicknesses of paper can be laid on at the same time. Take about six\r\nsheets together from the water, fold them, and then double them twice,\r\nand slightly tear the wet doubled edges, so that when the sheets are laid\r\nopen again there are a number of small slits in the paper; then lay them\r\nout together on any flat surface, and beat them out with a brush for a\r\nfew minutes. It is easy to separate them again into the required number\r\nof sheets in thickness.\r\n\r\n‘Another method which is equally good, if not better than the last, is,\r\nafter making the tears in the doubled sheets as before, to unfold them,\r\nand then to roll them together and twist them up like a rope, and rub\r\nthem well between the hands; then unroll them and beat them out for\r\na moment, separating as many sheets as are required. Either of these\r\nprocesses loosens the fibre of the paper, whilst the slits prevent it\r\nstretching unevenly. After this treatment it feels to the touch more like\r\nwet leather than paper.\r\n\r\n‘As the mould grows thicker the pulpy paper will, from the continual\r\nbeating, find its way into, and fill up, the deeper cutting; but it\r\nshould be most carefully watched that the mould is not left too thin over\r\nthe more prominent parts of the surface, and, with a little practice,\r\nthe thickness is easily judged by the touch. It is always well to use the\r\nfingers frequently both in pressing the paper into its place and working\r\nin the paste.\r\n\r\n‘It is difficult to lay down any rule as to the thickness of a mould and\r\nthe number of coatings of paste necessary. If the mould is of large size,\r\nand the carving presents prominent angles or large curves, it may need an\r\naverage of thirty sheets in thickness to preserve its shape, and three\r\nor four coatings of paste; but if the carving is in low-relief on a flat\r\nsurface, less than half the thickness will suffice.\r\n\r\n‘In hot weather, out of doors, a mould will take about twenty-four hours\r\nto dry; but it should be covered up at night from the dew. In damp\r\nforests or in bad weather I have dried most of my moulds by building up\r\nlarge wood fires at the distance of a few feet from the sculpture.\r\n\r\n‘It is best to take off a mould when it is cool—in the morning or\r\nevening. _Don’t be in a hurry about it._\r\n\r\n‘If the mould is torn or broken in taking it off the carving, mend it\r\nwith paste _at once_.\r\n\r\n‘When a mould is taken off, lay it to dry in the sun on a flat surface,\r\nas there is usually some moisture left in it. If the mould is not flat in\r\nshape, support it carefully, so as to preserve the contours.\r\n\r\n‘When the mould is quite dry, it is advisable, but not necessary, to\r\ngive it, both back and front, one or more coats of boiled linseed oil.\r\nHeat this oil before applying it, and it will then soak in well, and\r\nuse either a soft brush, and be careful, in oiling the surface of the\r\nmould, not to rub too hard. As the paper easily absorbs moisture, the\r\nmoulds need to be carefully packed.’ Plaster casts can be taken very\r\nsuccessfully from paper moulds. See directions for casting above.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Rubbing_ can only be practised on a fairly smooth surface, and has\r\nnothing to recommend it except the ease and celerity with which it can be\r\ndone. The traveller may as well carry a little heel-ball in his kit. Any\r\nthin, tough paper will do.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Other Reproductions._\r\n\r\n_Planning_ and _drawing_ are dealt with in Vol. I. of these ‘Hints.’\r\n_Copying_, as distinct from either, applies to inscriptions. A hand-copy\r\nof an inscription as well as a mechanical reproduction should always be\r\nmade, partly because it has the better chance of surviving the accidents\r\nof travel, partly because, if a stone surface is at all perished, anyone\r\nwith a keen eye and power of concentration ought to see more lettering\r\non its worn parts than will appear on a photograph or ‘squeeze.’ The\r\ncopy should be as near a facsimile on a reduced scale as time and other\r\nconsiderations will allow. It should be made on ruled paper, if possible\r\non paper ruled in squares (_en quadrille_), and the relative position\r\nof the letters to one another must be kept as far as possible. All\r\nbroken parts of letters are to be scrupulously copied (they can often be\r\ndistinguished from stone-flaws by feeling along the bottom of the groove\r\nwith a knife-blade; if that finds an even line, the groove is probably\r\npart of a letter), and all intervals where letters have perished beyond\r\nthe copyist’s power to recover them should be measured, and by comparison\r\nof equal intervals containing decipherable letters in other parts of\r\nthe inscription, the number of lost letters can be estimated. These\r\nshould be indicated by dots in a shaded patch. Letters, about which the\r\ncopyist is not quite certain, must be dotted or drawn in faint line. If\r\na stone be imperfect at the sides, and there be any means of estimating\r\nits original breadth, the line of its true centre should be marked on\r\nthe copy. Such an observation will be invaluable to the restorer of the\r\ntext. All letters that have peculiar forms should be carefully drawn at\r\nleast once, as specimens. If the text is grouped about, among, or in any\r\nrelation to, sculptures, such relation should be indicated, even if the\r\nwhole sculpture be not drawn. Marks of punctuation or division, ligatures\r\nof one letter with another, and ornate initials and finials, should be\r\nlooked out for and noted. On beginning a copy it is well to transcribe\r\nfirst the most obviously easy parts of the inscription: they will give an\r\ninkling of the character of the text, teach the forms of lettering used,\r\nand accustom the eye to the inscribed surface. On finishing a copy, if\r\nthere be time, read it over, try to translate it, and in the light of the\r\nprobable translation, attack again the harder parts of the inscription.\r\nIn the case of stones with two or more texts inscribed one over the other\r\n(as frequently happens on Roman milestones, which may be geographical\r\ndocuments of great importance), a ‘squeeze’ must be got at all costs, for\r\nan untrained copyist will make little or nothing of them, and find it\r\nvery difficult to draw an accurate hand facsimile.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Literary Memoranda._\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to make too many notes of a monument, and quite easy\r\nto make too few. The nature of the great majority of such notes must be\r\nleft to the discretion of the traveller; but concerning all antiquities,\r\nfrom buildings to beads, it may be said that, at any rate, material,\r\ncolour, dimensions, condition of preservation, arrangement of parts and\r\ncharacter of ornament must be jotted down in the ever ready note-book.\r\nIn the case of buildings, notes giving all dimensions are especially\r\nimportant, since the camera can seldom be brought to bear on all parts\r\nand details, and there is often not opportunity to draw out a plan on\r\nthe spot. Of inscriptions certain facts must be recorded, viz., form of\r\nthe stone; condition of its surface; the material and colour; on what\r\nsides complete, and on what not; actual dimensions; height of lettering;\r\ngeneral character of lettering; whether well or ill cut, plain or ornate.\r\nEpigraphists’ notebooks are procurable in Germany and Austria containing\r\ndivisions for the notes on all these points, together with a ruled\r\nspace for the actual inscription. In the case of coins, the material,\r\nthe ancient value, the weight (if possible), the state of preservation,\r\nand the images and superscriptions should be noted; of sculpture, the\r\nmaterial, the dimensions, the degree of finish, and a minute analysis\r\nof the subject, the dress of the figure or figures, their gestures,\r\nattributes, and so forth.\r\n\r\n\r\nB.—CLEANING AND CONSERVATION.\r\n\r\nThe traveller will not have occasion to render more than ‘First Aid’\r\nto objects of antiquity, _i.e._ to clean them so that their true\r\ncharacter may appear, and to consolidate them with a view to safe\r\ntransport. He should do the least that is absolutely necessary, leaving\r\nall elaborate treatment to experts at home. The hints here given are\r\ntherefore elementary, and concerned mainly with portable objects. In this\r\nconnection these are best classified by the materials of which they are\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Gold._—Gold requires no immediate treatment, unless it be laid\r\nover a core of other metal, _e.g._ copper or bronze, which has oxidised\r\nout through cracks. This oxide can usually be removed by picking or by\r\nsharp scaling blows with a small hammer and chisel. If it is obstinate,\r\nuse dilute hydrochloric acid laid on with a brush. The proportion of pure\r\nacid should not be more than one part to ten of water.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Silver._—If in very much corroded condition, technically known as\r\n‘dead,’ silver should be left alone. If there is only slight superficial\r\ncorrosion, soak in a solution of common salt or lemon juice, or strong\r\nammonia, and polish after a few hours. If there is a good deal of\r\nchloride on the surface, but the body of the metal seems sound, put zinc\r\nor iron in the solvent and the chlorine will pass over, leaving a powdery\r\nsurface which can be brushed clean. Silver should never be packed in a\r\ntin box, even if wrapped up, or it will be found on arrival at home to\r\nbe stained with a brown rust, very difficult to remove. Pack in wood or\r\ncardboard.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Copper and Bronze._—Both copper and bronze objects are best\r\ncleaned, if possible, with hammer and burin. Bronze, however, which\r\nthe traveller will meet with most often, is frequently covered with\r\na corrosion which cannot be scaled off at once, and calls for an\r\nacid solvent. Diluted hydrochloric (1:10) will act most quickly and\r\neffectually, but it leaves a white oxy-chloride coat, not easily got\r\nrid of either from the metal or the fingers of the operator, which it\r\nstains deeply. On the whole, we recommend that (1) if the bronze be badly\r\ncracked it be left alone; (2) if not cracked, but covered with very hard\r\ncorrosion, soaking in a weak solvent like lemon-juice be tried; and (3)\r\nafter that (or before, if the corrosion will yield to a tool at all)\r\nevery effort be made to pick or flake off the corrosion, after which the\r\nobject should be rubbed well with oil in the palms of the hands.\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Lead and Iron_, after oiling, are both best left alone by the\r\ntraveller.\r\n\r\n(_e_) _Stone._—The traveller will seldom or never be under the necessity\r\nto treat stone surfaces, except in the case of inscribed marbles on\r\nwhich carbonate of lime has formed, or small objects attacked by salt.\r\nThe former can be cleaned with strong acid; the latter must be soaked\r\nin water for long periods, and when drying laid with the most important\r\nsurface downwards, so that evaporation into the air may take place\r\nthrough the less important surfaces.\r\n\r\n(_f_) _Pottery and Terra-cotta._—The same enemies, carbonate of lime and\r\nsalt, attack pottery and terra-cotta, and are met in the same way as in\r\nthe case of stone; but the hydrochloric or other acid solvent should be\r\nweaker, and where there is colour be very cautiously used, if at all.\r\nIn packing vases, it should be remembered that if many are put into one\r\ncase without partitions, and one collapses, this will probably entail the\r\nbreaking of the lot. Large vases should be filled with tightly rammed\r\npacking. Nothing of heavier or more solid material, _e.g._, stone, should\r\nbe put in a case with pottery.\r\n\r\n(_g_) _Wood, Ivory, and Bone._—These materials are generally found\r\nflaked, split, or scaly, and need consolidation before packing. The\r\nmethods most likely to be open to the traveller are: (1) if the objects\r\nare not excessively tender, to dip them in melted vaseline, let this\r\nset, wrap in tissue paper and pack carefully in cotton wool; (2) if the\r\nobjects are very tender or rotten with salt, to make a stiff jelly, drop\r\nthem in before it sets, and convey them home in aspic. On the way the\r\njelly will absorb the salt. In addition to either process, it is often\r\nwell to bind the object in every direction and part with fine thread\r\nto keep it from splitting, or prevent the sections, if already split,\r\nfalling apart and splintering or warping in different directions. If\r\nthere is crystalline carbonate of lime on the surface of bone or ivory,\r\nit had better not be touched except by experts.\r\n\r\n(_h_) _Papyrus._—Papyrus needs damping and flattening out as far as\r\npossible without breaking its fibre. Lay it between two damp towels,\r\nand after flattening, pack it between sheets of paper in close tin\r\nboxes, filling each box up tightly. But the traveller will be wise not\r\nto try too much. As soon as the edges of his roll or fragment cease to\r\nbe brittle to the touch he had best leave the papyrus as it is without\r\nfurther unrolling, and pack very carefully away.\r\n\r\n(_j_) _Glass, Glazed Objects, Pastes, Amber, Various Compositions._—None\r\nof these should the traveller try to treat. Glass must be left wholly\r\nalone if in a flaking state; other objects, if flaky or powdery, will, at\r\nleast, be no worse for having been dipped in melted vaseline than they\r\nwould be in any case, after transport.\r\n\r\nNo general hints can be usefully given about either the methods of\r\ndiscovering antiquities or those of detecting forgeries. It is not\r\nsupposed that the travellers here addressed will undertake regular\r\nexcavations. Should they propose to do so, they will need special\r\ntraining and much more elaborate instruction. Mr. Petrie’s ‘Methods and\r\nAims’ will supply much of the latter, but the tyro excavator will not\r\nhave Mr. Petrie’s success without serving a long apprenticeship.\r\n\r\nThe above hints will serve for the traveller who takes antiquities by the\r\nway and in the day’s work, having other objects more in view. For him the\r\nfollowing list of necessities will suffice:—\r\n\r\n1. Long extension camera and all photographic requisites, including, if\r\npossible, a stand and frame for overhead photography (_v._ p. 52).\r\n\r\n2. ‘Squeeze’ paper, brushes with hand-straps or curved handles, and tin\r\ncylinders for carrying the paper and moulds; heel-ball, sealing-wax,\r\ntin-foil, beeswax.\r\n\r\n3. Planning and drawing outfit.\r\n\r\n4. Notebooks ruled _en quadrille_, magnifying-glass and hand-mirror.\r\n\r\n5. Small hammer and chisels for metal work, hydrochloric acid, ammonia,\r\nemery-paper, tissue paper, burin, plate brushes, sheet zinc, vaseline,\r\ncotton-wool (_not_ raw cotton-waste with hard seeds in it).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nMEDICAL HINTS.\r\n\r\n_By the late WILLIAM HENRY CROSSE, M.D._\r\n\r\nRevised and brought up to date by ANDREW BALFOUR, C.B., C.M.G., M.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following hints, which were compiled by the late Dr. W. H. Crosse,\r\nformerly the experienced medical adviser of the Royal Niger Company,\r\nbased upon previous editions of this work, have been edited so as to\r\nbring them up to date. A good deal remains as Dr. Crosse wrote it, but\r\nseveral sections have been almost entirely re-written, in order to bring\r\nthem into line with modern views. New sections have been introduced and\r\nthere have been numerous additions and corrections.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\nIn the following pages the chief emphasis has been laid upon the care of\r\nthe health in the tropics; but it must be remembered, that whilst by far\r\nthe greater proportion of travellers go to the tropics, most of these\r\nhints for the preservation of health apply equally well for all climates.\r\n\r\nThough many subjects have been briefly dealt with, certain matters have\r\nbeen rather more fully written up, such as the treatment of wounds. It\r\nis, in the author’s opinion, so important that the traveller should\r\nthoroughly understand what is meant by ‘surgical cleanliness’ that the\r\nusual methods observed by surgeons to ensure it have been plainly set\r\nforth. The author, of course, understands that in many cases it would be\r\nquite impossible to carry out the instructions in every detail, but it is\r\nhoped that a thorough knowledge of the principles underlying the correct\r\ntreatment of wounds will assist the traveller in doing the best possible\r\nfor his patient in any emergency, and under even the most unfavourable\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to observe that travellers in remote regions, and\r\nespecially in tropical climates, are much more exposed to physical ills\r\nand diseases than most residents at home, and that they are more likely\r\nto be placed beyond the reach of skilled medical and surgical aid when\r\nit is most required. It is chiefly for the use of the non-professional\r\ntraveller that the following pages have been written, and with this aim\r\nin view the symptoms and general treatment of the diseases and injuries\r\nwith which he is most likely to be brought in contact are dealt with in\r\nsimple, non-technical language.\r\n\r\nEvery traveller should supply himself with either Bernard Myer’s ‘Atlas\r\nof First Aid Treatment’ or Hastings Young’s ‘First Aid to the Sick,’\r\nbooks of general utility. Travellers visiting countries with hot\r\nclimates will find Garry’s ‘Some Factors Influencing Health in Tropical\r\nand Sub-tropical Climates’ a useful book, despite a few errors, while\r\nthe small ‘Primer of Tropical Hygiene’ by Colonel R. J. Blackham, is a\r\nvaluable guide to things hygienic as is Professor Simpson’s ‘Maintenance\r\nof Health in the Tropics.’\r\n\r\nA few books may be mentioned as specially suitable for those travelling\r\nin the countries with which they deal, such as ‘Hints for Residents and\r\nTravellers in Persia’ by A. R. Neligan, ‘Health Preservation in West\r\nAfrica’ by J. C. Ryan, ‘Hygiene and Disease in Palestine’ by Masterman,\r\nand ‘The Epidemics of Mauritius’ by Anderson.\r\n\r\nThose who read German will find the ‘Gesundheitlicher Ratgeber für\r\nAuswanderer,’ issued under the auspices of the Institut für Schiffs- und\r\nTropenkrankheiten in Hamburg, of considerable service, and if they intend\r\nvisiting South America it is worth noting that from the same source a\r\nseries of small books to guide the traveller in different parts of that\r\ncontinent will soon be forthcoming. This series will also include works\r\non Mexico, Angola and Siberia. These German guides are obtainable from L.\r\nFriederichsen & Co., Hamburg.\r\n\r\nPersons who intend to travel should undergo a thorough medical\r\nexamination, in order to ascertain if they are likely to be able to stand\r\nthe fatigues, exposures and privations to which they will probably be\r\nsubjected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.—DIAGRAM SHOWING SOME OF THE PRINCIPAL ORGANS OF\r\nTHE BODY, AND THE COURSE OF THE MAIN BLOOD-VESSELS.]\r\n\r\nMost people of good constitutions and regular temperate habits can, with\r\ncare, maintain a good state of health in the tropics, and many of those\r\nwho have been by no means strong at home are able with some extra caution\r\nto do well even in the hottest climates.\r\n\r\nThe intending traveller should attend a course of ambulance lectures in\r\norder to prepare himself for the responsibilities which he will have to\r\nundertake. As much time as possible should be devoted to discussing with\r\nsome professional friend the uses, correct doses, and proper methods of\r\nprescribing and combining the drugs which are to be taken on the journey,\r\nand in becoming familiar with the position of the principal bones,\r\nvessels and other important structures of the human body.\r\n\r\nA traveller should understand how to use the clinical thermometer, how to\r\ntwist or tie a bleeding vessel, how to use the hypodermic syringe and the\r\nsyphon stomach tube. He should learn how to cleanse a wound, how to treat\r\na case of snake-bite, and should know the best way in which to set a\r\nbroken limb. Such things are not easily learnt from books, and experience\r\nalone will give the necessary skill and confidence. Many valuable lives\r\nhave been saved by travellers who have fairly mastered the rudiments of\r\nmedical and surgical treatment, and who have been able in an emergency\r\nto give the necessary drugs, administer an antidote, or to stop severe\r\nbleeding.\r\n\r\nThe ideal traveller is a temperate man, with a sound constitution, a\r\ndigestion like an ostrich, a good temper, and no race prejudices. He is\r\ncapable of looking after details, _e.g._, seeing that drinking water has\r\n_really_ been boiled, and is willing to take advice from those who have\r\nmade journeys in countries similar to the one in which he is about to\r\ntravel.\r\n\r\nA traveller should be supplied with suitable housing, food and clothing,\r\nand should have a proper supply of medicines, dressings, and medical\r\ncomforts.\r\n\r\nIn selecting the drugs with which the traveller should be provided before\r\nleaving home care should be taken to see that only reliable products be\r\npurchased. In the tropics, and in exploration generally, the medical\r\noutfit is subjected to very severe tests, and it is a mistaken policy to\r\neconomise on medicines. The latter should be as portable as possible and\r\nbe properly packed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Risks to Health in a Tropical Climate._\r\n\r\nSeeing that these hints will be chiefly required by travellers in\r\ntropical or sub-tropical climates, it may be well to indicate some of\r\nthe chief risks which are to be met with in warm climates, and the best\r\nmethods of meeting them.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that any detailed reference to questions of outfit, such\r\nas the supply of proper food or clothing, is omitted, as these matters\r\nhave been fully dealt with in ‘Hints on Outfit,’ published by the Royal\r\nGeographical Society uniformly with this ‘Hints to Travellers,’ and it is\r\nunderstood that this work will be consulted by all who read these hints.\r\n\r\n_Chill._—The most prominent feature of a tropical climate is undoubtedly\r\nheat, and yet the greatest risk arises not so much from excessive\r\nhigh temperature as from a risk of chill, which is due mainly to the\r\nexcessive perspiration which takes place. This must be guarded against\r\nby the use of proper clothing, the most important point being that\r\nthe underclothing should be partly of absorbent material. For general\r\nuse cotton is best, and the vest or undershirt should in the tropics\r\nbe of the Aertex Cellular type. It is a mistake to wear wool next the\r\nskin in hot countries, for it soon gets sodden with perspiration and\r\nis irritating. A light flannel shirt worn over the open cotton mesh is\r\nprobably the best arrangement though a mixture of wool and cotton may be\r\nemployed for the shirting. This question is fully dealt with in ‘Hints\r\non Outfit.’ It is particularly important to avoid sudden changes of\r\ntemperature, and if exposed to the cooling sea breeze, special care must\r\nbe taken as to proper clothing. Parke laid great stress on the importance\r\nof avoiding chills, draughts, or wettings. He remarked “In crossing\r\nEquatorial Africa the Relief Expedition found that every wetting meant\r\nan attack of fever.” The sea breeze, which is so refreshing and cool, by\r\nchecking the perspiration, frequently acts as the exciting cause of an\r\nattack of fever. There is special liability to chill and subsequent fever\r\nwhen ascending an eminence, as the exertion causes profuse perspiration,\r\nand the cool breeze encountered on arrival at the top is very likely to\r\nproduce ill effects.\r\n\r\nOn completing a day’s journey, the underclothing, at least, should be\r\nchanged without delay, and the skin should be well dried by the free use\r\nof a rough towel. If at all possible a warm bath should be taken.\r\n\r\nThe cummerbund is a useful article of clothing, especially for men in the\r\nevening. It does away with the need for a waistcoat, which often proves\r\nhot and uncomfortable, and yet provides the necessary safeguard against\r\nchill to the abdominal organs.\r\n\r\nA word as to the use of a flannel cholera belt, about which opinions\r\ndiffer. Experience in many tropical countries leads the writer to\r\nrecommend its use at night, and at night only. Even so, it is unnecessary\r\nand uncomfortable in places where the nights are invariably hot and\r\nsteamy, and is chiefly of value in dry, desert climates where there is a\r\ngreat difference between the day and night temperatures.\r\n\r\n_Effects of the Sun._—It is difficult to overestimate the importance of\r\nthe protection of the head from the direct rays of the sun. It is best,\r\nwhere possible, to avoid going out in the heat of the day, but where this\r\nis necessary the head should be protected by a suitable helmet, which\r\nshould be light in weight and colour, which should be ventilated, and\r\nwhich should have a good protection for the back of the head. A large\r\ngreen leaf inside the helmet might be an additional protection, and a\r\nsun umbrella should also be used wherever practicable. A helmet should\r\nas a rule be worn when going out during the day-time in the tropics.\r\nSometimes, however, the helmet is found very troublesome, as, for\r\nexample, by the sportsman in the bush. He may then have recourse to a\r\ndouble Terai hat, or even to an ordinary wide-brimmed felt hat provided\r\nhe inserts a crumpled-up handkerchief in its crown. This will usually\r\nafford a reasonable protection.\r\n\r\n_Errors of Diet._—The lassitude which is often so much felt by Europeans\r\nresident in the tropics too frequently tempts them to the abuse of\r\nalcoholic stimulants and highly-spiced foods. The habit is a most\r\npernicious one, for such indulgence is one of the most fruitful causes\r\nof the permanent ill-health so often wrongly attributed to the mere\r\nresidence in a hot climate. There is no doubt that food should be taken\r\nwith greater moderation in hot than in cold climates; heat-producing\r\narticles of diet, such as fat, should be taken in far smaller quantity,\r\nbut an ample supply of vegetables is essential. The meals should never be\r\nheavy, especially during the heat of the day, and intervals of about four\r\nhours should always separate consecutive meals.\r\n\r\nCooking should always be conducted with great care in the tropics, for\r\nthe stomach and liver are less able to bear any extra strain, such as\r\nwould be induced by the attempt to digest imperfectly-cooked food.\r\nParasites are often introduced into the system by insufficiently cooked\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nNatural milk must be boiled; condensed milk should be mixed with boiled\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nExcess in the use of alcoholic stimulants is one of the most fatal errors\r\ninto which the tropical resident can fall, and their habitual use as\r\nbeverages is totally unnecessary, tea, coffee and cocoa being the best\r\nbeverages for ordinary use. A small supply of brandy, champagne, and port\r\nwine may be of service in certain cases of illness, but they are better\r\nregarded as belonging strictly to the medical equipment.\r\n\r\nAvoid native drinks, as they will probably have been diluted with dirty\r\nwater, or prepared in unclean vessels.\r\n\r\nGreat moderation in the use of alcohol is quite as necessary in arctic as\r\nin tropical climates. In the latter no alcohol should be taken till the\r\nsun has set, and even then the quantity should be strictly limited. There\r\nis no reason why a glass of light beer, a whisky and soda, or a little\r\nlight wine should not be drunk with the evening meal. Alcohol taken at\r\nthis time often promotes appetite and aids digestion, but alcohol between\r\nmeals is bad, chiefly perhaps because the habit of exceeding the daily\r\nallowance is thereby apt to be engendered. It is largely a question of\r\nself-control, and it must be remembered that in the tropics self-control,\r\nso far as drinks are concerned, is very apt to weaken. Apart from the\r\nquestion of its habitual use alcohol is often of great service as a\r\nrestorative, as, for example, after a fatiguing march, and especially if\r\none has got wet and chilled. Champagne is possibly the best form to take\r\non such occasions and it should be used as an apéritif or drunk along\r\nwith food.\r\n\r\n_Risks due to Drinking Water._—The use of water for drinking purposes\r\nmust be attended with great care in all tropical climates. As the water\r\nof the lakes, streams and pools of these countries usually contains\r\na large proportion of impurities, and the germs or parasites of many\r\ndiseases, it should be strained and subsequently boiled before being used.\r\n\r\nAs, however, it is not always possible or convenient to incur the delay\r\nof boiling the drinking water and allowing it to cool, it is advisable\r\nthat a _reliable_ filter should be taken.\r\n\r\nMost filters—charcoal or otherwise—are merely death-traps, as the\r\naccumulation of germs and injurious matter within the filtering substance\r\nsoon renders the water more dangerous than if unfiltered. There are,\r\nhowever, a few filters which, with ordinary care in cleansing, are in\r\nthemselves efficient safeguards. The most highly recommended of these\r\nare the Pasteur Chamberland and the Doulton filters. In any case, spare\r\nfiltering candles should be taken, and these should be cleaned and boiled\r\nat least every three days. It is recommended that the filter-makers\r\nshould be consulted immediately the probable requirements of any\r\nexpedition are known. It should be remembered that no filter combines\r\nrapid delivery of water with efficient sterilization. A mistake commonly\r\nmade is to boil water and then filter it. This should never be done.\r\n\r\nThe drinking of very cold water, to which there is great temptation when\r\none is exhausted by prolonged heat and copious perspiration, should\r\nbe carefully avoided; thirst often induces tropical residents to have\r\nrecourse to iced water, which is always apt to be dangerous if taken\r\nwhen one is heated. The drinking of copious draughts of water is also a\r\nhabit to be deprecated; it certainly weakens the muscular energy, and as\r\nthe water is rapidly lost by perspiration, the feeling of exhaustion is\r\nincreased. Hot or cold weak tea, without milk or sugar, is one of the\r\nleast injurious of all beverages.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Precautions on the Voyage._\r\n\r\nThe traveller should endeavour to land in a perfectly healthy condition,\r\nand to this end he should on the voyage out take plenty of exercise,\r\ndrink little or no alcohol, be moderate as to diet, and avoid much meat\r\nand rich dishes. Neglect of these obvious rules frequently ends in the\r\ntraveller arriving in a flabby, bilious condition, in which state he is\r\npredisposed to attacks of malaria, dysentery, and other diseases.\r\n\r\nConstipation is frequent at sea, and a seidlitz powder, a dose of fruit\r\nsalt, or one or two cascara tabloids may be necessary. If constipation is\r\nsevere, then one or two four-grain blue pills should be taken at bedtime,\r\nfollowed in the early morning by a seidlitz powder or some other saline\r\naperient.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid chill the traveller should be properly clothed during\r\nthe evening or when there is a cool breeze, and should not stand in\r\ndraughty doorways and passages on board. If he is proceeding to a country\r\nwhere there is endemic malaria he should begin his course of prophylactic\r\nquinine on ship-board, because even a single night spent ashore in\r\na malarious locality may result in his acquiring infection. It is\r\ntherefore advisable to begin taking quinine in the manner described on p.\r\n207 at least two days before arrival at the place of disembarkation.\r\n\r\nWhat is true of the journey out is of even greater importance on the\r\nvoyage home. There is a serious danger of illness owing to chills\r\ncontracted on board ship when leaving a hot climate. Quinine should be\r\nsystematically taken as recommended on p. 208.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL HINTS.\r\n\r\n_Never take a cold bath in the Tropics unless ordered to do so by a\r\ndoctor._—In the case of persons who have already suffered from many\r\nattacks of fever, dysentery, or any disease of the liver or other\r\nimportant organs, warm bathing should alone be used. Bathing should\r\nnever be resorted to during the period of digestion, _i.e._, three to\r\nfour hours after meals. Wear warm clothes at night. Avoid the direct\r\nrays of the sun. Do not take too much animal food. Never begin work on\r\nan empty stomach. Never neglect a slight attack of fever or diarrhœa.\r\nKeep the bowels gently opened—once a day is quite enough—but avoid strong\r\npurgatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Vaccination._\r\n\r\nIt is essential that all the members of an expedition should be\r\nre-vaccinated if they have not suffered from small-pox or been vaccinated\r\nwithin two years. A proper supply of vaccine should be carried on the\r\njourney. Heat and bright sunlight are very detrimental to vaccine lymph.\r\nHence the proper transport of such lymph in hot climates is a matter of\r\ngreat importance and by no means always easy to arrange. Where a thermos\r\nflask is available it may be used for storing and carrying the capillary\r\ntubes, or they may be wrapped up in green leaves and inserted into a\r\nhollow bamboo, the ends of which are closed with cotton wool.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Inoculation._\r\n\r\nOwing to the prevalence of typhoid and paratyphoid fevers in hot\r\ncountries it is essential that all persons, and more especially young\r\nadults, proceeding to tropical countries should undergo preventive\r\ninoculation. Two injections of the so-called triple vaccine, at ten days’\r\ninterval, are necessary, and both should be given shortly before leaving\r\nor, if arrangements can be made, one or both may be given on ship-board.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Isolation._\r\n\r\nOn the outbreak of an infectious complaint, such as small-pox (which is\r\nvery common amongst negro carriers), the sufferer should be promptly\r\nisolated, and one or more attendants should take charge of the case and\r\nnot be allowed to come to camp. It is wise to select as attendants those\r\nwho have either had the disease, or who are protected (as by vaccination)\r\nagainst it.\r\n\r\nIn Nigeria it was found most convenient to build grass huts, which were\r\nburnt to the ground, together with the clothing and bedding of the\r\npatient and attendants, on the termination of the outbreak.\r\n\r\nAll vessels which are not destroyed must be boiled thoroughly. The\r\nmotions, etc., of patients suffering from typhoid fever, cholera and\r\ndysentery should be disinfected, preferably by boiling, or, better still,\r\ndestroyed by fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Transmission of Infection._\r\n\r\nThe traveller should remember that of late years the rôle of the healthy\r\nhuman “carrier” in the transmission of many communicable diseases has\r\nbeen established. This is true of such diseases as enteric fever and\r\ncholera, and when engaging servants, porters, and camp followers it is\r\nimportant to inquire into their previous history and, if necessary, to\r\nmake certain that they do not harbour the specific organisms of such\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES AND THEIR PREVENTION AND TREATMENT.\r\n\r\nIn the tropics, as elsewhere, the diseases to which the traveller is\r\nliable are due to widely differing causes, but in hot countries climatic\r\nconditions and parasites play a predominant part. Insects are very\r\nfrequently to blame for the transference of the latter from the sick\r\nto the sound, both insects which are not themselves parasitic on man,\r\n_e.g._, the mosquito and the tsetse fly, and those which make man their\r\nhost, _e.g._, lice and fleas.\r\n\r\nIt is useful for the traveller to bear diseases in mind from the\r\nstandpoint of their etiology, as in this way he can more readily grasp\r\nthe measures necessary for their prevention.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the following classification is given, merely as a guide,\r\ntogether with a few examples. The diseases themselves, for the sake\r\nof convenience of reference, are grouped alphabetically and are not\r\nclassified in any way.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Table of Diseases Classed according to Etiology._\r\n\r\n\r\nA.—_Parasitic._\r\n\r\n(i.) Due to “contact” either direct or through the agency of clothes,\r\nbedding, etc. Also due to direct inoculation through the skin or mucous\r\nmembrane.\r\n\r\n_Examples_: Many skin diseases, venereal diseases, small-pox, tetanus,\r\nand blood-poisoning (septicæmia).\r\n\r\n(ii.) Due to “mouth to mouth” infection, through the agency of so-called\r\n“droplet” infection, expectoration, coughing, sneezing, etc.\r\n\r\n_Examples_: Influenza, pneumonia, and pneumonic plague.\r\n\r\n(iii.) Due to “droplet” infection, as above, or to infected scales from\r\nthe skin, or to infected discharges from the nose, throat, or ear.\r\n\r\n_Examples_: Measles, scarlet fever, small-pox, chicken-pox, diphtheria.\r\n\r\n(iv.) Due to excremental infection through the agency of water, food,\r\nflies, fingers, dust, and soil.\r\n\r\n_Examples_: Enteric (typhoid) fever, dysentery, diarrhœa, cholera, worm\r\ninfections of many kinds.\r\n\r\n(v.) Due to inoculation through the bites of insects, or the entry\r\nthrough skin abrasions of the infected excreta or infected crushed\r\ntissues of insects rubbed or scratched into these lesions.\r\n\r\n_Examples_: Malaria, yellow fever, tick fever, sleeping sickness,\r\nfilariasis, relapsing fever, typhus fever, bubonic plague.\r\n\r\n(vi.) Due to invasion of the body by insects in their adult or larval\r\nstages.\r\n\r\n_Examples_: Chigger, myiasis of various kinds.\r\n\r\n\r\nB.—_Non-Parasitic._\r\n\r\n(i.) Due to climatic conditions.\r\n\r\n_Examples_: Heat stroke, diarrhœa in some instances, constipation in many\r\ncases, rheumatism, prickly heat, chilblains.\r\n\r\n(ii.) Due to errors in diet.\r\n\r\n_Examples_: Diarrhœa, beri-beri, scurvy, sprue(?).\r\n\r\n(iii.) Due to poisons.\r\n\r\n_Examples_: Scorpion sting, snake-bite, vegetable poisons.\r\n\r\n(iv.) Miscellaneous.\r\n\r\n_Examples_: Bed-sores, epilepsy, apoplexy, concussion of the brain, hay\r\nfever, and other conditions into the cause of which a mechanical element\r\nfrequently enters.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that some of these diseases, such as small-pox and\r\ndiarrhœa, come under more than one heading, but this does not detract\r\nfrom the general utility of the above classification.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bed-sore._\r\n\r\nWhen a patient is confined to his bed for a long time it is necessary\r\nto support the lower part of the back on something soft, such as a pad\r\nof wool, or an extra pillow, in order to prevent the formation of a\r\nbed-sore; pillows should also be placed under the hips and heels.\r\n\r\nTo harden the skin it is well to rub it with alcohol or to treat it with\r\noil or white of an egg three parts, and spirits one part; zinc ointment\r\nis also useful for this purpose.\r\n\r\nBesides pressure, the most frequent cause of bed-sores is constant\r\nmoisture from the passage of urine and motions and consequent damping of\r\nthe sheets. Great care must be taken to thoroughly dry the back after any\r\nevacuation; the lower part of the back should be dusted with a powder of\r\nboric acid and zinc oxide.\r\n\r\nIf a bed-sore is present the patient should lie on a circular pad with a\r\nhole in the middle, to take pressure off the bed-sore. The sore should\r\nbe thoroughly cleaned twice a day with some antiseptic lotion, such as\r\nchinosol or permanganate, and subsequently dressed with zinc ointment or\r\nvaseline.\r\n\r\nIf the bed-sore is on the back, the patient should lie if possible on\r\neach side alternately, to relieve the pressure.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Beri-beri._\r\n\r\nIn most cases this is a disease due to some deficiency in the dietary,\r\nwhich leads to a form of what is called peripheral neuritis. The name is\r\npossibly derived from a Cingalese word signifying “I cannot.”\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._—Weakness of the legs and digestive troubles, abnormal\r\nsensations in the legs, frequently associated with swelling. The gait\r\nalters, and the arms and fingers may be affected. The condition is one of\r\nspreading paralysis, and in bad cases the heart is affected. In so-called\r\nwet beri-beri the patient becomes bloated as in dropsy, while in dry\r\nberi-beri he wastes away until he is little better than a skeleton. There\r\nis a “squatting test” which may enable one to recognize the disease at\r\nan early stage. The patient, with his hands on the top of his head, is\r\nunable to assume a squatting position and to rise from it unaided. If he\r\nis squatting and has to rise he accomplishes the act by climbing, as it\r\nwere, up his own legs.\r\n\r\n_Prophylaxis._—Avoid overcrowding, as this seems in some cases to\r\npredispose to the disease. Give the yeast extract known as “Marmite,”\r\nwhich is supplied in small cubes one-quarter ounce in weight. One\r\nshould be taken twice a week, either alone or with bread or biscuit, or\r\ndissolved in warm water in the form of a soup. Lentils, other legumes,\r\nand oatmeal are useful. Eggs and fresh meat, when obtainable, are very\r\nvaluable.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—This is chiefly dietetic. Give yeast, two ounces daily,\r\nalong with milk and sugar, or marmite in one-cube doses twice a day. Eggs\r\nare specially useful, while fresh milk, legumes, and nourishing soups are\r\nall indicated. Only small quantities of food should be given at a time.\r\nRest in bed is very important, and the patient must be careful when he\r\nis allowed to get up owing to the danger of heart failure. Tonics are\r\nrequired during convalescence.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Blackwater Fever._\r\n\r\nBlackwater fever is probably a pernicious complication of malarial\r\nfever, and derives its name from the colour of the urine. It must be\r\nremembered that dark-coloured urine is usual in all fevers; it is scanty\r\nduring the height of the fever, especially if there is much sweating.\r\nIf, however, it is obviously “bloody,” the case is more grave, but as a\r\nrule it is only men broken down in health, and those who have resided in\r\nblackwater countries, _e.g._, Tropical Africa, parts of India, the West\r\nIndies, etc., for at least a year, especially those who have taken their\r\nprophylactic quinine irregularly, who suffer from this complication.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the occurrence of this condition is not fully known. Some\r\nhave ascribed the symptoms entirely to the taking of quinine, but as the\r\nfever often occurs where no quinine has been given this is impossible. At\r\nthe same time it appears likely that in certain cases of malaria, owing\r\nperhaps to some idiosyncrasy, quinine may help to bring on the symptoms.\r\nIt is possible that chill occurring during the course of a fever may lead\r\nto the production of blackwater fever. Those who have had one attack are\r\nparticularly liable to a recurrence, and after two consecutive attacks\r\nreturn to a temperate climate is required.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._—In addition to the ordinary symptoms of malarial fever, the\r\nurine is dark, blood-like, and eventually porter-coloured; it is often\r\nscanty, and may become entirely suppressed. The skin is yellow, often\r\na bright orange, there is frequent vomiting, often hiccough, and the\r\nvomited matter is usually of a green colour.\r\n\r\n_Prophylaxis._—With our present knowledge all that can be said is that\r\nmalaria prophylaxis is also the method to prevent blackwater. Such\r\nprophylaxis, so far as quinine is concerned, must be properly carried\r\nout. Those who take quinine regularly, and in sufficient doses, do not\r\ncontract blackwater fever. Chill and excesses of all kinds must be\r\navoided.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Much the same treatment should be adopted as that fully\r\ndescribed later for malaria. It is especially important to give an\r\naperient at the beginning, and perhaps five grains of calomel is the best\r\nform. In every case, no matter how slight, it is essential to ensure,\r\nwherever possible, absolute rest in bed and skilled and careful nursing.\r\nIf it can possibly be avoided a blackwater patient should never be moved\r\nfrom the place where he is taken ill. So long as he has a bed to lie on,\r\na roof to cover him, and some sensible person to look after him who will\r\ncarry out the doctor’s orders, he should be treated on the spot. It is\r\nbetter, when it can be arranged, for the nurse to go to the patient than\r\nfor the patient to come to the nurse.\r\n\r\nThe chief aim should be to support the strength by fluid nourishment, and\r\nto secure free action of the kidneys. The former should be maintained\r\nby fluid nourishment given in small quantities at frequent intervals,\r\nsuch as milk, Plasmon, Benger’s food, Allenbury’s foods, invalid Bovril,\r\nBrand’s fever food, or Brand’s essence, Maggi’s consommé. A little\r\nPlasmon added to any of the meat preparations would be useful, while\r\nraisin tea is a valuable preparation.\r\n\r\nIn order to maintain free action of the kidneys, plenty of fluid should\r\nbe given, such as barley-water made from Robinson’s prepared barley,\r\nflavoured slightly with lime-juice or lemons. Weak tea is useful.\r\n\r\nDiuretics which stimulate the kidneys must be avoided. The most effective\r\nmethod of flushing the kidneys is by giving saline injections by the\r\nbowel, but these, as a rule, can be administered only by a medical man\r\nor by a trained nurse under a doctor’s supervision. It may, however, be\r\nstated that the amount usually given is six ounces of physiological salt\r\nsolution (seven and a half grains of sodium chloride to the ounce of warm\r\nwater). This is administered every hour, or even oftener, if necessary,\r\nin bad cases. In mild cases enemata every four or six hours will suffice.\r\nOther measures are the application of poultices or hot fomentations to\r\nthe loins when suppression threatens, or when there is severe lumbar\r\npain. Diaphoretics, so long as they do not depress the heart, are useful,\r\nand so is frequent sponging. Cold applications to the head and especially\r\nbehind the ears alleviate headache.\r\n\r\nThe question of giving or of withholding quinine is an important one, but\r\nrecent work on the subject indicates that in the absence of a medical man\r\nwho can carry out blood examinations, it is advisable to give quinine as\r\nin the case of malaria.\r\n\r\nVomiting is often a serious complication, and the directions for its\r\ntreatment, given under the head of malaria, should be carefully followed.\r\nIf it cannot be speedily checked, feeding by the bowel must be carried\r\nout. _See_ Nutrient Enema, p. 259.\r\n\r\nSo long as plenty of urine is passed and sufficient nourishment is taken\r\nthere is little cause for anxiety, though wherever possible skilled\r\nassistance should be obtained at the earliest opportunity.\r\n\r\nAfter an attack the patient is very weak and anæmic. He requires careful\r\nfeeding and tonics, especially iron and arsenic. It is advisable that he\r\nshould be invalided out of the endemic area, and he should be specially\r\nwarned as to the danger of getting chilled or wet.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bronchitis, or Inflammation of the Branches of the Windpipe._\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._—When bronchitis exists, there is a good deal of coughing—at\r\nfirst dry, but afterwards accompanied by frothy expectoration—with a\r\nsensation of rawness and tenderness at the upper part of the breastbone.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—In the early stages of this condition, opium in some form or\r\nother will be found beneficial, and will often cut short an attack; for\r\nthis purpose, ten grains of Dover’s powder, or fifteen to twenty minims\r\nof chlorodyne, may be given every eight hours for twenty-four hours, and\r\nthen be gradually diminished.\r\n\r\nIf the breathing is difficult, poultices should be applied to the chest\r\nand ipecacuanha, half to two grains, and ammonia, should be given three\r\ntimes a day. Later, stimulating expectorants, such as ammonium carbonate,\r\nshould be administered.\r\n\r\nInhalation of steam often gives great relief; and the effect is much\r\nimproved if thirty drops of Friar’s balsam are added to a pint of hot\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nIn tropical climates even an ordinary feverish cold very often tends to\r\nbecome malarial in character, therefore the use of quinine, in addition\r\nto the other treatment, is usually desirable, and five grains may be\r\ngiven thrice a day.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Burns and Scalds._\r\n\r\nWhere an extensive burn or scald has occurred, the clothing of the\r\ninjured part should be removed by cutting, so as to cause as little\r\nirritation as possible. If the burn is only slight, the surface may be\r\ncovered over with lint smeared with zinc or boric ointment, or oil. If\r\nthere is much blistering, or the surface is charred, the skin should\r\nbe cleaned up as well as possible with boric acid lotion, and hot\r\nfomentations of the same applied for twenty-four hours. After this, the\r\nburn may be dressed twice a day with boric ointment spread on lint. Great\r\ncleanliness is an important factor in the successful treatment of burns.\r\nIn a severe burn, stimulants must be given, and the patient put to bed\r\nwith hot-water bottles, and active treatment of the burn should be left\r\ntill the patient has somewhat recovered from the shock.\r\n\r\nWhen there is great pain, chlorodyne or laudanum in full doses will be\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cerebro-Spinal Fever._\r\n\r\nThis disease, also known as “spotted fever,” is of special importance at\r\nthe present time to the traveller in Central Africa, where it is very\r\nprevalent amongst the natives, especially in Uganda. It may, however,\r\nbe encountered in all parts of the world, and in the tropics is very\r\nfrequently a malady of the dusty months.\r\n\r\n_Causes._—The disease is very often transmitted from some carrier of\r\nthe causative organism, which occurs in the throat and nose, and is\r\ndistributed by coughing, spitting, or sneezing. Infected material, such\r\nas handkerchiefs, may play a part, and the spread of the disease is\r\ngreatly favoured by overcrowding, especially of sleeping quarters.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._—In very acute cases the onset may be very sudden, the patient\r\nrapidly losing consciousness. As a rule the disease begins with headache,\r\nstiffness of the neck and chilly sensations. There may be vomiting, and\r\nthe temperature is raised. The mind is often confused, and the patient\r\nmay be delirious. The skin eruption, which occurs especially on the back\r\nand about the joints, and which is responsible for the name “spotted\r\nfever,” is not very frequently seen, and can hardly ever be detected\r\non a dark skin. In very bad cases there is violent delirium, laboured\r\nbreathing, and a purulent discharge from the nostrils. One of the most\r\ncharacteristic features is retraction of the head, while a dislike to\r\nlight is common.\r\n\r\n_Prophylaxis._—Avoid unnecessary fatigue and guard against overcrowding,\r\nfaulty conditions of ventilation and those which tend to cause\r\nnaso-pharyngeal catarrh. Persons who have been in contact with cases of\r\nthe disease are probably well advised to wash out their noses with a\r\ndilute solution of permanganate of potash 1 in 1,000.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—In the absence of a medical man this can merely be\r\nsymptomatic. Hot baths relieve pain and restlessness. Ice to the head,\r\nantipyrin, caffeine or aspirin relieve headache, and sedatives may be\r\ngiven for the insomnia and delirium. The patient’s mouth is foul, and\r\nshould be carefully swabbed and kept clean.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chicken-Pox._\r\n\r\nIn the tropics this disease is very largely one of adults.\r\n\r\nIncubation period, a fortnight to three weeks. Rash appears first day.\r\n\r\n_Rash._—Pink spots, upon which blebs form after twelve to twenty-four\r\nhours. The blebs are at first transparent, but subsequently become\r\nyellowish, and after two to three days shrivel and separate, leaving a\r\npink scar.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms are usually very mild, perhaps only slight fever, and\r\npossibly headache. The appearance of the rash is often the first symptom.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Isolation, and light diet. Bed may not be necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chilblains and Frostbite._\r\n\r\nChilblains are usually found on the fingers or toes—after exposure\r\nto severe cold—especially when tight gloves or boots have been worn.\r\nCertainly the best way to promote the formation of chilblains is to\r\ntoast the semi-frozen fingers or toes at a fire or stove, before the\r\ncirculation has been re-established.\r\n\r\nWhen chilblains are threatened, the part should be well rubbed with snow,\r\nor with camphorated spirit. Sponging with hot vinegar is very effective.\r\nChilblains are checked in the early stages by painting with tincture\r\nof iodine. Once they have developed a preparation containing carbolic\r\nacid is useful in allaying pain and causing them to disappear. Ulcerated\r\nchilblains should be dressed with boric ointment spread on lint.\r\n\r\nProlonged exposure to intense cold leads to development of frostbite. If\r\nthe case is a bad one, or injudiciously treated, gangrene or death of the\r\npart always follows; if this is extensive, amputation may be necessary.\r\n\r\nFrostbite should be treated first by vigorous friction with snow or\r\npounded ice. The affected parts should then be well wrapped with cloths\r\nwet with cold water. It is extremely dangerous to bring them near a fire.\r\nAfterwards, the part should be wrapped in cotton-wool.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cholera._\r\n\r\nCholera is a serious acute disease, characterised by frequent watery\r\nmotions, vomiting, cramp and collapse.\r\n\r\n_Cause._—It is often contracted by drinking contaminated water.\r\n\r\nResearch has shown the importance of the cholera “carrier,” that is to\r\nsay the person, usually a native, who harbours in his bowel the specific\r\norganism of the disease. He may be perfectly healthy and yet be able to\r\ntransmit cholera to other people by infecting water or food. The rôle of\r\nflies, infected clothes and rags, and faulty conservancy methods must be\r\nkept in mind.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._—Giddiness, faintness, persistent vomiting and diarrhœa, great\r\nprostration, feeble pulse, cold perspiration, colic, intense thirst, and\r\nconstant desire to pass urine. The vomit and motions rapidly become like\r\nrice-water in appearance, and the urine is more or less suppressed. There\r\nare severe cramps in the legs, belly, and other parts of the body. If\r\nthen the pulse becomes weak, the temperature low, and the countenance\r\ndusky, the patient will probably sink. On the other hand, reaction may\r\nset in, all the symptoms abating, and the pulse, temperature, and colour\r\nbecoming natural; the water is passed more freely, vomiting is less\r\nfrequent, and the motions become more natural in colour.\r\n\r\n_Prophylaxis._—Anti-choleraic inoculations are now practised. They not\r\nonly afford a considerable degree of protection but lessen the risk of\r\na fatal issue in the inoculated. Hence it is advisable to be vaccinated\r\nagainst cholera whenever there is risk of infection. The inoculation\r\nmust be repeated after the lapse of four months if the epidemic still\r\npersists, as the protection afforded is only temporary. Persons\r\ntravelling in regions where cholera is present in an endemic form should\r\ntake a little lactic acid in tea, or add a little vinegar or thirty drops\r\nof dilute hydrochloric acid to every ounce of drinking water.\r\n\r\nAt times of epidemic prevalence it is essential that all water should be\r\nboiled. The practice of hand-shaking should be discouraged, indigestible\r\ndiet should be avoided, and raw fruit, raw vegetables, and meat jellies\r\nshould not be eaten. Lettuces and celery, being moist and eaten uncooked,\r\nare specially dangerous. Patients and contact cases must be isolated,\r\nand the former should be protected from flies. It is very necessary to\r\nmaintain a strict supervision of cooks and cooking arrangements. All\r\nkitchen cloths should be washed in permanganate solution or boiled. Milk\r\nshould always be boiled.\r\n\r\nCholera stools may be disinfected by adding a five per cent. cresol\r\nsolution to them and allowing it to remain in contact with the stool for\r\nat least one hour. Quicklime is excellent as a disinfectant. Add together\r\nequal parts of fresh quicklime and water, dilute with three times as much\r\nwater as previously used, add a quantity of this slaked lime equal to the\r\namount of stool to be disinfected and allow it to remain in contact with\r\nthe stool for one hour. When the ground has been fouled by dejecta or\r\nvomit, disinfect with cresol, or rake hot ashes over it or pour kerosene\r\noil upon it and set the latter alight. Cholera-soiled clothing, bed\r\nlinen and blankets should be soaked in a two and a half per cent. cresol\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Isolate the patient, keep him warm, and give ice to suck.\r\nApply hot bottle to the feet, and mustard leaves to the pit of the\r\nstomach.\r\n\r\nIt is advisable to clear the bowel of irritating material at the outset\r\nby giving half an ounce of castor oil with a teaspoonful of brandy. Drugs\r\nare of little use in cholera, but some like to give one drop of carbolic\r\nacid, together with twenty drops of spirit of camphor (or peppermint,\r\nor a little brandy), five grains of bismuth, and ten grains of soda,\r\nsuspended in one ounce of gum water, every four hours. Chlorodyne may be\r\ngiven to allay severe pain.\r\n\r\nEven in the mildest cases absolute rest in bed is essential, and a warm\r\nbed-pan should be provided.\r\n\r\nIn the early stages no food at all should be given, but plenty of\r\nfluid should be allowed, though it must be administered only in sips.\r\nStimulants may be necessary. Later on fluid food such as milk should be\r\ngiven carefully, and the quantity gradually increased.\r\n\r\nThe special treatment for cholera can only be carried out by a medical\r\nman, and recourse should be had to his help at the earliest possible\r\nmoment, as everything depends upon immediate treatment. If, after the\r\nacute symptoms subside, diarrhœa continues a dose of bismuth is often\r\nuseful.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Colic._\r\n\r\nThis is the name given to the well-known severe twisting or griping pains\r\nin the belly, usually due to excessive flatulence, and resulting from\r\nconstipation, or some error of diet.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Hot fomentations should be applied to the belly, or better\r\nstill, the Instra, which is the best means of applying continuous heat\r\nto any part of the body. A turpentine enema (a tablespoonful to a pint\r\nof warm water) will nearly always cut short the symptoms; in the absence\r\nof turpentine, give warm water alone. A full dose of opium (20 minims)\r\nshould also be given if the pain is severe, preferably in a tablespoonful\r\nof castor oil.\r\n\r\nBicarbonate of soda, carbonate of ammonia and ginger should be freely\r\ngiven in full doses, and the bowels should be well opened as soon as the\r\nsevere pain has passed off.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Concussion of the Brain._\r\n\r\nThis term is applied to the partial suspension of the functions of the\r\nbrain, produced by the severe shaking of its substance by a fall or blow.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._—At first the patient lies in an unconscious condition,\r\nskin cold and clammy, pulse and breathing very feeble, and temperature\r\nextremely low; he can be slightly roused by shouting; he cries out if he\r\nis moved, or when painful applications are made, but quickly relapses\r\ninto insensibility. The stage of unconsciousness may pass off almost at\r\nonce, it may be prolonged for hours or days, or the patient may never\r\nrecover from it. The second stage—that of reaction—is marked by returning\r\nconsciousness and frequently by vomiting, the skin becomes warm, and\r\ngradually the patient recovers; on the other hand, inflammation of the\r\nbrain may set in, or he may again become unconscious and die.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Keep the patient perfectly quiet in bed, in a darkened\r\nroom, give a milk diet, and if he is much excited, apply cold cloths or\r\nan ice-bag to the head. If there is much prostration apply a hot-water\r\nbottle, and restore the circulation by rubbing the limbs. When reaction\r\nsets in, give five grains of calomel.\r\n\r\nStimulants should be avoided in cases of concussion of the brain,\r\nunless the collapse is very alarming (when ammonia should be given),\r\nas they tend to cause too violent reaction, which might be followed by\r\ninflammation of the brain and its coverings.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Constipation._\r\n\r\nThis condition is very frequent in tropical climates, where it is\r\nassociated with sluggishness of the liver. One of the best remedies is\r\nthe two-grain tablet of cascara, of which one may be taken three times\r\na day. Rhubarb is also a very useful drug. In addition to this, an\r\noccasional dose of a saline purge should be used, or a large enema of\r\nsoap and water may be given. Five grains of blue pill or three grains of\r\ncalomel will be found to act as a very efficient aperient, especially if\r\nfollowed in about six hours by a saline such as fruit salt. Castor oil\r\nis a valuable remedy, but it must be remembered that in the tropics its\r\neffects are sometimes rather severely felt, and hence it is well to give\r\nit in somewhat smaller doses than those usually employed in temperate\r\nclimates. Three-quarters of an ounce may be given where an ounce would\r\notherwise be employed.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the general health of people suffering from simple\r\nconstipation is not seriously affected.\r\n\r\nIn cases of chronic constipation one of the anti-constipation products,\r\notherwise known as the Aloin Co., given three times a day and gradually\r\nreduced, will be found useful.\r\n\r\nIn most acute diseases, such as malaria, pneumonia, etc., if constipation\r\nis present, it should be treated at once by means of suitable aperients.\r\n\r\n_Note._—In peritonitis, _i.e._, inflammation of the bowels, hernia, and\r\nin some cases of typhoid, constipation is a leading symptom, and is\r\naccompanied by severe pain in the belly. On no account should an aperient\r\nbe given by the mouth in these cases. If it is necessary to clear the\r\nbowels, this should be done by means of an enema.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coryza, or Cold in the Head._\r\n\r\nWhen a cold is confined to the head it can usually be cut short by\r\nretiring to bed early, taking a ten-grain dose of Dover’s powder,\r\nfollowed by hot drinks to encourage the perspiration which the action\r\nof this drug produces, together with the use of as many additional\r\nbed-clothes as can be borne. Care must be taken to avoid chill on the\r\nfollowing morning. Once it is established the condition is difficult to\r\ncure, but marked relief will often be afforded by washing out the nose\r\nwith a solution made from naso-pharyngeal products. In fact, a simple\r\nnasal glass douche should form part of the traveller’s outfit, at least,\r\nif he is liable to bad colds in the head. In tropical regions five grains\r\nof quinine should be added to the dose of Dover’s powder. When there\r\nis a liability to colds in the head the use of preventive vaccines is\r\nrecommended, but these should not be employed without the advice of a\r\nmedical man.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cystitis, or Inflammation of the Bladder._\r\n\r\n_Causes._—Injury or the result of operations, extension of inflammations\r\nsuch as gonorrhœa, retention and decomposition of urine; debilitated or\r\ngouty persons are especially liable to this affection.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._—Intense pain in the lower part of the belly, and in the\r\ncrutch, continual desire to pass water, with frequent passage of small\r\nquantities. The urine is scanty, high-coloured, foul-smelling, and\r\noccasionally blood-stained, and there may be some fever.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Hot baths, leeches, or fomentations to the crutch, and\r\na sedative, such as opium (preferably given by the bowel), will be\r\nrequired. If the disease continues the bladder should be washed out\r\nthrough a catheter with weak boric acid solution, five grains to the\r\nounce, or chinosol (1 in 2000), twice a day. Urotropin, ten grains, and\r\ncopaiba or sandal-wood oil in ten-drop doses.\r\n\r\nThe diet should be restricted to milk.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dengue._\r\n\r\nThis disease, also known as dandy fever and break-bone fever, occurs in\r\nmany parts of the world, and it is most common along littorals, probably\r\nbecause the Stegomyia mosquito which carries the infection is usually\r\nnumerous in sea-coast places.\r\n\r\n_Cause._—The organism of dengue fever is unknown, but the infection has\r\nbeen proved to be carried by at least one species of mosquito.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._—The incubation period varies from about five to ten days. The\r\nonset is very sudden, the temperature rising rapidly. Within an hour or\r\ntwo an initial rash appears, which varies in appearance and is transient.\r\nThe patient suffers from severe headache and pain in the joints and back.\r\nIndeed, the condition closely resembles a sharp attack of influenza, but,\r\nas a rule, there are no signs of coryza. The eyes are very painful and\r\ninsomnia is present. The high temperature lasts for three or four days,\r\nthen drops, continues low from twelve hours to three days and rises again\r\nsharply. During the interval the patient feels better but the symptoms\r\nstart again when the temperature rises for the second time. In the second\r\nstage the true rash of dengue appears, which is rather like that of\r\nmeasles, and it is followed by desquamation of the skin. The disease,\r\nthough often causing great weakness, is very rarely fatal.\r\n\r\n_Prophylaxis._—Protect against mosquito bites by using a proper mosquito\r\nnet or by employing mosquito repellents such as “sketofax.”\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Light diet, rest in bed, phenacetin and aspirin for the\r\nrelief of pain and headache. Cold sponging helps the febrile condition\r\nand the insomnia. During convalescence there is often much depression,\r\nand the patient benefits by being ordered tonics and a sound wine.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Diarrhœa._\r\n\r\nDiarrhœa, or looseness of the bowels, is one of the most common and\r\none of the most serious ailments of the tropics, and should never be\r\nneglected. In many cases it is a sign of enteric fever, dysentery,\r\ncholera, or sprue, the symptoms of which are given below. Ordinary\r\nattacks are usually due to the presence of some irritant in the bowels,\r\nsuch as irritating sand, bad food, unripe fruit, or other poisonous\r\nmaterial. Amongst African and other natives diarrhœa is often due to a\r\nfaulty or ill-cooked dietary. The importance of flies in fouling food\r\nshould not be overlooked.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Begin the treatment by administering castor oil, fruit salt,\r\ncascara, or other mild aperient, to clear out the cause of the diarrhœa.\r\nIf castor oil is used the following note as to its administration is\r\nlikely to be of service. Place an ounce of brandy in a glass or cup.\r\nCarefully pour the oil into the centre of the brandy and then add one\r\nounce of water. The mass of oil will then resemble the yolk of an\r\negg enclosed in the white. Lime juice may be used instead of brandy.\r\nFailing these, black coffee helps to cover the taste and “feel” of the\r\noil. Sometimes three grains of calomel with fifteen grains of sodium\r\nbicarbonate act better than castor oil. A warm-water enema of about a\r\npint is useful.\r\n\r\nIf the diarrhœa continues, give chlorodyne (20 minims) and tincture of\r\nginger (10 minims) in an ounce of water two or three times a day.\r\n\r\nThis treatment should not be persisted in for more than two days.\r\n\r\nIf the diarrhœa is persistent, an astringent is needed: five grains of\r\ntannin, or two or three grains of sulphate of iron may be given three\r\ntimes a day. Ten grains of quinine should be given each day.\r\n\r\nAll food should be semi-solid and tepid; milk diet, as recommended below\r\nfor enteric fever, is the safest food, but soup thickened with rice or\r\narrowroot is good. The patient should keep in bed and wear a flannel band\r\nround the belly. Sometimes in the tropics, as the result of excessive\r\npurgation, diarrhœa is very acute and may be alarming. In such cases a\r\nhot bath, stimulants and the administration of astringents are indicated.\r\n\r\nIf the trouble continues for more than a few days it is probably due to\r\ndysentery, or typhoid.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Diphtheria._\r\n\r\nDiphtheria is an acute infectious disease, the essential feature of which\r\nis a peculiar inflammation of the lining membrane of the mouth, nose,\r\nthroat, and windpipe, characterised by the formation of a membrane upon\r\nthe inflamed surface. Diphtheria occurs in the tropics but happily does\r\nnot spread much in hot countries.\r\n\r\n_Causes._—It may be contracted from some person suffering from the\r\ndisease, from a healthy “carrier” harbouring the specific micro-organism\r\n(_Bacillus diphtheriæ_) in his throat or nose, or from infected milk, etc.\r\n\r\nAs the disease is a very grave one, and skilled treatment is often an\r\nabsolute necessity, measures should be immediately taken to summon\r\nmedical assistance on the first appearance of diphtheria, or the patient\r\nshould be sent as speedily as possible to a place where medical aid is\r\nlikely to be obtained; for if the breathing becomes so difficult that the\r\npatient gets blue in the face, an operation for opening the windpipe will\r\nbe necessary.\r\n\r\nIncubation period, two to six days or even longer.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._—Headache, discomfort, loss of appetite, sore throat, and\r\nsickness, with swelling of the glands at the angle of the jaw. On\r\nexamination the palate and tonsils are seen to be swollen, with a white\r\ndeposit of membrane upon the surface. The membrane may be thick and\r\ntough, and if stripped off will leave numerous small bleeding points.\r\n\r\nThe temperature may run up, and is irregular in type. The pulse is rapid\r\nand feeble, and the bodily strength is quickly lost.\r\n\r\nIf the nose be affected there is copious discharge from the nostrils,\r\nwith difficulty of breathing and much discomfort. If the windpipe is\r\naffected the voice will become hoarse or absent, and there will be\r\ngreater difficulty in breathing, accompanied by a loud crowing noise.\r\n\r\nDiphtheria may be accompanied by cough and pneumonia.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Isolation. Bed. If diphtheria anti-toxin is obtainable, it\r\nshould be administered at the earliest opportunity, but this should only\r\nbe carried out by a doctor.\r\n\r\nNourishing foods and stimulants should be given frequently in small\r\nquantities. The throat should be thoroughly and frequently washed out\r\nwith chinosol (1 in 1000) or other antiseptic lotion. If the difficulty\r\nin breathing is marked, warm baths should be given at intervals of about\r\nfour hours. A steam kettle should be placed near the bed. The expulsion\r\nof the membrane may often be aided and great relief afforded by the\r\nadministration of emetics, such as ipecacuanha, but these must be given\r\nwith care owing to the risk of heart failure.\r\n\r\n_Complications._—Diphtheria may be followed by paralysis of the windpipe\r\nwith loss of voice, or paralysis of other parts of the body, therefore\r\ngreat care should be taken not to allow convalescents to get up too soon,\r\nno matter how well they may appear.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dysentery._\r\n\r\nThis disease, which is due to an inflammatory condition limited as a rule\r\nto the lower or large bowel, may be the result of a variety of causes,\r\nbut there are two chief types which must be clearly distinguished: (1)\r\nAmœbic dysentery, due to a protozoon or animal organism, (2) Bacillary\r\ndysentery, caused by certain micro-organisms belonging to the vegetable\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nAmœbic dysentery is much more of a tropical complaint than is bacillary\r\ndysentery, but the latter is also common both in tropical and temperate\r\nclimates. Both forms are transmitted in much the same way and their\r\nsymptoms are very similar. Hence from the layman’s point of view no good\r\npurpose is served by considering them separately, at least so far as\r\nmethods of transmission and symptoms go. The treatment of the two forms,\r\nhowever, differs, and to carry out such treatment effectively medical\r\nskill is required.\r\n\r\n_Causes._—Dysentery is conveyed by impure drinking water, contaminated\r\nfood, infected flies, and possibly also by infected dust. In both forms,\r\nbut especially in the amœbic variety, the so-called “carrier” plays an\r\nimportant part, because in the latter case the organism produces cysts\r\nwhich are passed by the bowel, and these cysts are frequently found in\r\nthe dejecta of persons who have suffered from amœbic dysentery and who\r\nare either convalescent or possibly in quite good health. If these cysts\r\nfind their way into food or water and are then swallowed they are capable\r\nof developing in the human intestine and producing dysentery. Carriers\r\nare also met with in the bacillary form of the disease. Dysentery may be\r\nprovoked by chills, general debility and exhausting conditions, such as\r\nchronic malaria.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._—Diarrhœa with pains in the belly, straining and frequent\r\ndesire to go to stool. The motions soon become small in amount, slimy,\r\nlose their natural colour, and contain more or less blood; when there\r\nis ulceration of the coats of the bowel, the motions are extremely\r\noffensive, and bleeding may be very free. There is heat, tenderness, and\r\nbearing down about the outlet of the bowel, with considerable prostration\r\nand probably some fever; there is frequently a constant desire to pass\r\nwater. All these symptoms may be due to severe ordinary diarrhœa; but\r\nin the tropics it is best to treat them as if they were dysenteric.\r\nSome guide may be obtained as to the form of dysentery from which the\r\npatient is suffering by taking his temperature. As a rule there is little\r\nor no fever associated with the amœbic form, while in the case of the\r\nbacillary type the temperature is always raised and in severe cases may\r\nbe considerably elevated. It is in this form that the small intestine is\r\napt to become involved and then the condition is more serious.\r\n\r\nOne help in diagnosis, though not a very reliable one, is the character\r\nof the stool. In amœbic dysentery the blood is apt to be mixed with the\r\ndejecta and to be dark in colour, while the whole mass looks brown or\r\ngreyish green. The stool of bacillary dysentery, on the other hand, has\r\na whitish appearance, the blood in it is bright coloured and is often in\r\nthe form of streaks or spots. The amœbic form is apt, if not promptly and\r\nefficiently treated, to be followed by inflammation of the liver, which\r\nmay go on to liver abscess.\r\n\r\n_Prophylaxis._—Avoid chill and debilitating causes of all kinds. In\r\ncountries where there is a great difference between the day and the night\r\ntemperature wear a cholera belt. Carefully protect food and water from\r\ncontamination of any kind, and especially from flies. Doubtful water\r\nshould be boiled or rendered sterile by some chemical method. All milk\r\nshould be boiled. Care should be taken not to employ as cooks natives who\r\nhave recently suffered from dysentery, and scrupulous cleanliness should\r\nbe observed in the preparation of food. Unripe fruit and other materials\r\napt to cause diarrhœa should be avoided. Camp conservancy methods\r\nshould be carried out on approved sanitary principles which prevent the\r\naccess of flies to human excrement and prevent the latter from being\r\ndisseminated by wind or in any other way. All dysenteric stools should be\r\ncarefully disinfected or burnt.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—The general treatment is common to both forms, the\r\nessentials being rest, warmth and suitable food. Put the patient to bed,\r\napply a cholera belt and get the bowels open by an initial dose of castor\r\noil. If there is much pain ten drops of tincture of opium may be added\r\nto the oil. The usual dose of the oil is an ounce, but if the patient is\r\nfeeble or exhausted half an ounce will be sufficient.\r\n\r\nAs regards diet do not give any milk at first, and indeed if the case is\r\nrecognized as being one of bacillary dysentery milk should not be given\r\nat all as it tends to favour putrefaction. Albumin water, rice water,\r\nchicken broth are required during the first twenty-four hours. Thereafter\r\nin the amœbic form milk diluted with barley water or with citrate of\r\nsoda (three grains to the ounce) can be given. Soups are often useful,\r\nand at a later period custard, arrowroot and jellies are indicated. In\r\nthe bacillary type arrowroot, meat and fruit jellies and beef-tea can be\r\ngiven from the outset. In both types the food should be given in small\r\nquantities frequently, and it should be neither too hot nor too cold.\r\nAlcohol is deleterious.\r\n\r\nFortunately we now have a specific drug for treating amœbic dysentery\r\nand that is emetine, which is the active principle of ipecacuanha. It is\r\nbest given in the form of emetine bismuthous iodide, which is supplied\r\nin capsules and the dose of which is three grains per day for twelve\r\nconsecutive days. The dose is best given in the evening along with a cup\r\nof hot tea on a full stomach when the patient is in bed. If it causes\r\nmuch vomiting it is well to give ten or fifteen drops of tincture of\r\nopium before administering the emetine. The latter can also be given\r\nby subcutaneous injection, but this method of treatment should only be\r\ncarried out by a physician. Where emetine is not available ipecacuanha\r\nitself may be used and is given as follows:—\r\n\r\n_Treatment by Ipecacuanha._—When the bowels have been opened, give twenty\r\ngrains of ipecacuanha, either solid or mixed with a wineglass of water,\r\nor less; arrowroot, starch, or gum-water, which will help to suspend the\r\ndrug. Of course, ipecacuanha will act more quickly if it can be taken\r\nsuspended in a liquid, instead of in the solid form. To prevent vomiting,\r\nput a mustard leaf to the pit of the stomach. Absolute quiet must now\r\nbe observed; darken the room, and allow no moving in bed or talking.\r\nWithhold food and liquid for at least two hours if possible, but if there\r\nis much thirst, teaspoonful doses of water may be given.\r\n\r\nIf there is no vomiting for an hour, probably a good part of the\r\nipecacuanha has been digested; if it has been vomited, wait for\r\nhalf-an-hour, and then give another full dose. If vomited again, wait for\r\ntwo hours, and give twenty drops of chlorodyne, followed by twenty grains\r\nof ipecacuanha; the chlorodyne is to quiet the stomach, enabling it to\r\nretain the ipecacuanha. In about twelve hours from the first dose, repeat\r\nit in exactly the same way. If thirty grains are too much at a time,\r\ngive twenty, three times a day, for not less than sixty grains should be\r\ngiven in twenty-four hours. The drug is not a dangerous one, and, if the\r\npatient can take it, too much can hardly be given. Between the doses feed\r\nthe patient, giving but little at a time. If the ipecacuanha is going\r\nto do good, marked improvement should be apparent in four or five days;\r\nfailure of the drug is often due to its not being given or retained in\r\nsufficiently large quantities.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the emetine or ipecacuanha treatment it is well, save in\r\nmild or trivial cases, to give a saline mixture once a day, for example\r\none ounce of sodium or magnesium sulphate. Other methods which are\r\nhelpful are enemata of warm water, hot hip baths, or a soothing injection\r\nmade by soaking an ounce of linseed for several hours in two pints of\r\nwarm water. Sedatives, such as laudanum or chlorodyne, should be used\r\nonly in cases where there is severe pain, sickness and great distress.\r\nThe full dose in ordinary cases is twenty drops three times a day, but if\r\nless is sufficient so much the better, and it is advisable to avoid these\r\nremedies wherever possible.\r\n\r\nThe object of treatment is not to block up the bowel—as might be done by\r\ngiving large doses of opium or tannin—it is to cure the disease of which\r\nthe looseness is only one symptom. The most favourable sign during an\r\nattack is a return of the colouring matter to the motions; this shows\r\nthat the liver is again acting, and that the treatment is doing good.\r\nWith the return of colour (which at first may be intermittent), the other\r\nsymptoms, such as pain and bloody discharge, will abate, and the motions\r\nwill become more solid and healthy.\r\n\r\nIn dysentery, as in severe diarrhœa, the patient should _not_ be allowed\r\nto get up to stool. A box cut across obliquely will make a rough slipper\r\nbed-pan; put sand in it, and pad the edges.\r\n\r\nIn bacillary dysentery emetine is nearly or quite useless, and recourse\r\nshould be had to a saline treatment. A mixture containing sixty grains\r\nof sodium or magnesium sulphate, fifteen drops of dilute sulphuric acid,\r\nand five drops of tincture of ginger can be given in half an ounce of\r\npeppermint water, if necessary, every two hours at first, and then every\r\nfour or six hours, until the stools are watery and bile-stained. An\r\nalternative method of treatment, but one which is not so satisfactory, is\r\nto give half-grain doses of calomel every hour for twelve hours on three\r\nsuccessive days. The patient must, however, be watched for such symptoms\r\nas tenderness of the gums, salivation (_i.e._, great increase of the\r\nsaliva), and a metallic taste in the mouth. Should such symptoms arise\r\nthe doses must be reduced or the drug discontinued.\r\n\r\nThe general treatment is the same as that for amœbic dysentery. As colic\r\nis often very severe, turpentine stupes or poultices to the abdomen are\r\noften indicated.\r\n\r\nA specific anti-dysenteric serum is now employed in cases of bacillary\r\ndysentery, but its administration requires medical skill.\r\n\r\nWhen the acute dysenteric attack is over, bismuth may be given, and\r\nvarious astringent enemata may be tried, but these should not be\r\nadministered in the absence of a physician. A simple form of enema,\r\nhowever, is one containing a teaspoonful of alum or ten grains of\r\nsulphate of iron to the pint.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Enteric or Typhoid Fever, including the Paratyphoid Fevers._\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to give a full account of the enteric fevers here, and\r\nmoreover the presence of a medical man, still more of a good nurse,\r\nis absolutely necessary for their proper treatment. The chief early\r\nsymptoms, however, will be given, and a few hints as to their treatment.\r\nFor all practical purposes paratyphoid fever may be considered as a mild\r\nvariety of typhoid.\r\n\r\nThe disease is characterised by ulceration of the small bowel, with\r\ncontinued high fever, and is usually accompanied by diarrhœa.\r\n\r\n_Causes._—It is generally caused by the drinking of impure water, but\r\nmay also be transmitted by all the causes operative in the case of\r\ndysentery (_see_ p. 185).\r\n\r\nThe incubation period is from ten to fifteen days.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._—The early symptoms of the disease are often so slight that\r\nthe patient will not believe he is really ill; he may just feel out of\r\nsorts, or complain of headache, but still go about his work. There may\r\nbe diarrhœa, or occasionally constipation. After five or six days the\r\npatient is generally compelled to give up and go to bed, headache or\r\ndiarrhœa, or both, being the chief complaint. The temperature goes up\r\nin a characteristic manner, rising a little more every evening till it\r\neventually reaches 103° or 104° F. There may be some cough, and often\r\nthis symptom is a very troublesome one.\r\n\r\nThe belly is usually distended and slightly tender, and there may or may\r\nnot be the characteristic typhoid rash, consisting of rose-pink circular,\r\nslightly raised spots, about the size of a large pin’s head. They occur\r\nchiefly on the chest and abdomen, and come out on successive days, often\r\nonly three or four at a time. These spots are frequently absent, and then\r\none must be guided by the presence of other symptoms. They are difficult\r\nto be seen upon a dark skin.\r\n\r\n_The possibility of enteric fever should always be remembered in cases\r\nwhere there is constant fever, unaccompanied by any definite symptoms,\r\nsuch as the recurrent shiverings of malaria, or the spitting of blood in\r\npneumonia._\r\n\r\n_Prophylaxis._—As for dysentery (_see_ p. 186). Preventive inoculation\r\nis very important and confers immunity for a considerable period (_see_\r\n“Inoculation,” p. 168).\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Absolute quiet in bed. If constipated, bowels should be kept\r\nopen by soap and water enema only.\r\n\r\nMilk only (three to four pints daily) should be given during the whole\r\ncourse of the illness and till ten days after the temperature has\r\ndescended to, and remained, normal. Stimulants, if pulse is feeble and\r\nrapid; opium only if there is much pain. If bleeding occurs from the\r\nbowel, an ice poultice or cold-water cloths should be applied to the\r\nbelly; ice may be given to suck; opium and an astringent, such as tannin,\r\nadministered by the mouth, or an opium enema be given. Milk should be\r\ngiven in small quantities only, and to each half-pint five grains of\r\nbicarbonate of soda should be added.\r\n\r\nThe motions must be burned, or carefully disinfected.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Epilepsy._\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._—This is the most common form of fits. There are three stages.\r\n_1st stage_—The patient falls down completely unconscious and without\r\nwarning, the face is pale, the limbs become stiff and rigid, and the\r\nbreathing ceases. _2nd stage_—Convulsive movements take place, the\r\ntongue being often bitten, the breathing becomes heavy and laboured, and\r\nthe motions may be passed unconsciously. _3rd stage_—A confused mental\r\ncondition, sometimes acute mania, usually sleepy for some time. In some\r\ncases the fit may only last a few minutes. They almost always recur.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—During the attack nothing can be done beyond loosening all\r\ntight clothing, and gently preventing the sufferer from injuring himself\r\nin his struggles. It is especially important to keep the teeth apart with\r\na piece of cork or rubber to prevent the tongue from being bitten.\r\n\r\nBromide of potassium (ten to twenty grains) may be given three times a\r\nday as a preventive.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Faintness._\r\n\r\nBending the head firmly down between the knees is the best and most rapid\r\nway of dealing with an attack. Another method is to lay the patient on\r\na couch, loosen any clothing which is round the neck, bathe his face\r\nand arms with cold water, and fan him vigorously. Give three grains of\r\ncarbonate of ammonia in an ounce of water. Alcohol may be given if the\r\npulse is very weak, but sal volatile or carbonate of ammonia is more\r\nefficacious.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Filariasis._\r\n\r\nThis term connotes several pathogenic conditions, but the most important\r\nform of filariasis in man is that due to a small blood-worm which is\r\nconveyed by the bite of one or other species of mosquito. The most\r\nimportant symptom of filariasis is the condition known as elephantiasis,\r\nbut the presence of filaria in the blood also causes a febrile state and\r\nvarious other symptoms which need not be detailed.\r\n\r\n_Prophylaxis._—Protect from the bites of mosquitoes, especially those\r\nwhich breed in the vicinity of human habitations. The most effective\r\nmethod of doing this is the careful use of a mosquito net.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gonorrhœa._\r\n\r\nGonorrhœa, or clap, is an acute inflammation of the urethra or pipe,\r\nattended with a discharge of more or less matter. It is nearly always due\r\nto direct contagion.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._—At first there is some itching about the end of the pipe,\r\nwhich is followed by a yellowish-white discharge. This lasts from three\r\nto five days. Then great pain is noticed on passing water, and the\r\ndischarge becomes thick and yellowish-green in colour, with redness and\r\nswelling about the lips of the opening of the pipe. After a time the pain\r\non making water disappears, and the discharge becomes thin and watery, a\r\ncondition known as “gleet.”\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Forbid alcohol in any form. Give large quantities of\r\nliquid—water, weak tea, or milk—to thoroughly flush the system. Light\r\ndiet and as complete rest as possible. Keep bowels well open with saline\r\nand other purges. Give sandal-wood oil or copaiba, twenty drops three\r\ntimes a day, and urotropin, ten grains twice a day.\r\n\r\nIf there is much pain in the acute stage, a mixture containing fifteen\r\ngrains of bicarbonate of soda, and five drops of chlorodyne or laudanum,\r\nin an ounce of water, may be given twice a day. Except in very acute\r\ncases the pipe should be syringed out with a very weak solution of\r\npermanganate of potash, or better, a solution of protargol (quarter to\r\ntwo per cent.); later on, a lotion containing four grains of sulphate of\r\nzinc to one ounce of water may be used as an injection.\r\n\r\nIf the glands in the groin become tender and inflamed, they should be\r\npainted with tincture of iodine. If, in spite of this, the pain and\r\nswelling increase, they should be poulticed frequently, and treated as\r\nordinary abscesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hay Fever._\r\n\r\nThis is a very severe catarrh which attacks certain individuals yearly,\r\nwhen grasses and other plants are flowering. It is most probably due to\r\nthe irritation of the nose by pollen grains in the air.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Exposure to the irritating substances which are known to\r\nprovoke an attack should be avoided.\r\n\r\nThe nose may be syringed out with a lotion containing boric acid and\r\nbicarbonate of soda (five grains of each in four ounces of water), or\r\none containing bicarbonate of soda and salt (five grains of each in four\r\nounces of water), to which has been added two to four drops of carbolic\r\nacid. The interior of the nostrils may be anointed with vaseline. Menthol\r\nsnuff is of great value. A substance called “Pollantin” has a specific\r\naction in many cases, but it should be employed only under medical\r\nsupervision.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Influenza._\r\n\r\nInfluenza has been introduced into many tropical countries, in which it\r\nhas spread rapidly and caused in many instances a very heavy mortality.\r\nThe actual cause of the disease is still a matter of dispute, but there\r\ncan be no doubt that it is chiefly spread by personal contact.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._—What may be called the respiratory type is pretty well known\r\nto everyone, but it should not be forgotten that sometimes the main\r\nstress of the disease falls either on the alimentary or the nervous\r\nsystem, while there is also a type of what is known as febrile influenza\r\nin which the heat-regulating centre is greatly upset. In this latter form\r\nthe temperature may be intermittent and it is then apt to be mistaken for\r\nmalaria.\r\n\r\nThe respiratory type is the most important. Its incubation period is\r\nshort, one or two days. The onset is sudden and is characterized by\r\nshivering, pains in the back and limbs, severe headache and a feeling\r\nof malaise. The patient may be giddy and suddenly collapse, his throat\r\nis often dry and sore and he has an irritating cough. His temperature\r\nrises and runs up to 102° to 104° F. His face becomes flushed, his eyes\r\nreddened and his tongue is furred. Constipation is common. Uncomplicated\r\ninfluenza, if promptly attended to, is not a very serious disease,\r\nand improvement usually sets in about the third day. The most serious\r\ncomplication of influenza is bronchial pneumonia, and in some forms of\r\nthe disease the heart is very apt to be affected.\r\n\r\n_Prophylaxis._—Isolation of cases; free ventilation; treat patients\r\nas much as possible in the open air. Nurses and those attending the\r\nsick should be careful about contracting infection from the patient’s\r\ninvisible mouth spray. Indeed in some epidemics the use of face masks has\r\nbeen recommended.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Rest in bed as soon as possible; free purgation at the\r\noutset; an early dose of twenty to thirty drops of laudanum (Tinct.\r\nopii) is often very beneficial but the drug must be administered with\r\ncare. Aspirin in ten-grain doses thrice daily frequently relieves the\r\nmore urgent symptoms. In cases where there is vomiting and collapse with\r\nhigh temperature a dose of fifteen grains of aspirin with half to one\r\nounce of brandy and three drachms of liquor ammon. acetat. may act like\r\na charm. According to our present knowledge, however, it would seem that\r\ndrugs are of little use in influenza, and that the important thing is to\r\nensure good nursing and to keep up the patient’s strength. Quinine in\r\neffervescing form is very useful for convalescent cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Insect Pests._\r\n\r\n(_See also Myiasis and Skin Diseases._)\r\n\r\nThese are best divided into the Winged and Wingless forms. Of the winged\r\npests _Mosquitoes_ are undoubtedly the most important in the tropics, as\r\nthey are known to transmit such diseases as malaria, yellow fever, dengue\r\nfever and filariasis. The anopheline mosquitoes are those responsible for\r\ntransmitting malaria, and they can easily be recognized by the facts that\r\ntheir wings are usually spotted and that they appear as it were to stand\r\non their heads when resting on any flat surface. The culicine mosquitoes,\r\nwhich include _Stegomyia fasciata_, the carrier of yellow fever, do not\r\nas a rule have spotted wings and they rest parallel to the surface on\r\nwhich they alight. There are also marked differences in the water stages\r\nof these insects which cannot, however, be here considered.\r\n\r\nThe best way of protecting oneself against mosquitoes is the proper use\r\nof an effective mosquito net, the mesh of which should contain at least\r\nsixteen holes to the linear inch. Mosquito boots or buskins are also\r\nuseful, and in certain places hoods for the face and neck, such as the\r\n“Mosquinette” variety, will be found of value.\r\n\r\nRepellent substances applied to the skin may also be employed. Cassia\r\noil, with brown oil of camphor in vaseline, is useful. Vermijelli,\r\ncontaining a little citronella oil, is fairly effective but is not\r\nso pleasant to use. The irritating effect of mosquito bites may be\r\ndiminished by the application of tincture of iodine. The same measures\r\nare effective in the case of some of the biting midges.\r\n\r\nThe insects generally known as _Sand-flies_ are really owl midges or\r\nmoth flies, tiny and hairy insects which have been proved to transmit\r\nsand-fly fever (_see_ page 221). These flies breed in damp places where\r\nthere is rotting vegetation, dark and damp cellars, cracks and fissures\r\nin the soil, tunnels, etc., and they are often very troublesome. The\r\nrepellents mentioned above may be used to drive them away, as may\r\neucalyptus oil, camphor and tobacco smoke. The ordinary mosquito net is\r\nuseless against their attacks, and one containing twenty-two holes to the\r\nlinear inch is required.\r\n\r\n_Buffalo gnats_, which are often called sand-flies, are insects which\r\nbreed in running water and amongst cataracts and rapids. They are\r\nformidable biters although they are not known to cause any disease. The\r\nsame protective measures are indicated in their case as in that of owl\r\nmidges.\r\n\r\n_House Flies._—There are several species of these. They are definitely\r\nknown to distribute certain harmful bacteria and protozoa and to\r\ncontaminate food by carrying the organisms on their bodies, wings and\r\nlegs, or depositing them by regurgitation or in their droppings. Hence it\r\nis very important to protect all food and drink from flies and to destroy\r\nthese insects wherever possible. The subject of their destruction is too\r\nlarge a question to be dealt with here, so all that need be said is that\r\nthe traveller should provide himself with wire mesh fly covers to screen\r\nfood and also with pieces of mesh or calico weighted with beads, which\r\ncan be utilized for covering vessels containing milk or other liquids. It\r\nis worth noting that ordinary fish netting hung over a tent door or used\r\nto screen the windows or doors of a house will effectively exclude flies,\r\ndespite its large mesh.\r\n\r\n_Tsetse Flies._—These are considered under Sleeping Sickness (_see_ page\r\n234).\r\n\r\n_The Congo Floor-maggot Fly._—It is the maggot or larva of this fly which\r\nis important, as in many parts of Africa it infests the floors of native\r\nhuts and it is a blood-sucker feeding at night. So far as is known it\r\ndoes not convey any disease but it is an unpleasant visitor, and if its\r\nnumbers are great they may extract comparatively large quantities of\r\nblood from their unconscious victims.\r\n\r\n_Prophylaxis._—General cleanliness and enforcement of sanitary measures,\r\nthe use of high beds, the scrutiny of sleeping mats and blankets in which\r\neggs or larvæ may be concealed. Infected huts can be rendered habitable\r\nby firing the ground or by removing the surface soil, which can then be\r\ndisinfected.\r\n\r\n_Wingless Pests._—_Lice._—These are known to transmit typhus fever.\r\nFurther, they often cause great cutaneous irritation and are loathsome\r\ncompanions. It is no easy matter to get rid of lice when infection is on\r\na large scale, but very often this is not the case and it is possible\r\nto detect their presence only by careful examination. There is no real\r\ndifference between head lice and body lice; they are simply varieties\r\nof the same insect. The presence of head lice may be recognized by\r\nthe discovery of their eggs, which are known as nits and are minute,\r\nyellowish-white, goblet-shaped bodies about the size of a full-stop on\r\nthis page. Examination for head lice is much facilitated by the use of\r\na fine tooth comb. Persons suspected of harbouring body lice should be\r\nexamined first for the actual bites of the insect on the skin. Their\r\nclothes, and especially their under-garments, should then be carefully\r\nexamined, attention being more particularly directed to the seams and\r\nfolds where the eggs, if present, are most likely to be found.\r\n\r\nThe best preventive measure against lice is strict personal cleanliness.\r\nClothes should be frequently changed, and as frequently washed. The hair\r\nshould be kept cropped short, especially at the sides and back of the\r\nhead, and in the tropics it is very advisable to shave all hairy parts of\r\nthe body.\r\n\r\nSpace does not permit a full account of how to deal with verminous\r\npersons and verminous clothing, but it may be said that the only reliable\r\nmethods of destroying lice are by hot air, steam, boiling water, or\r\nhydrocyanic acid gas. At the same time it should be noted that the heads\r\nof those infested with head lice should be thoroughly combed and treated\r\nwith paraffin, petrol, or white precipitate ointment, and then well\r\nwashed with carbolic soap. The nits may be loosened by treatment with\r\nwarm vinegar or acetic acid. In the case of body lice possibly the most\r\nsatisfactory grease for application to the underclothing is one composed\r\nof crude unwhizzed naphthalene from the coke oven, four parts, and soft\r\nsoap, one part. It is important that the proper type of naphthalene be\r\nused.\r\n\r\nA useful palliative method is the ironing of clothing, especially along\r\nthe seams, with heavy hot irons.\r\n\r\n_Fleas._—Bubonic plague is known to be transmitted by fleas, and it is\r\npossible that they play a part in the transmission of that form of\r\nleishmaniasis which is known as kala-azar (_see_ p. 202). Fleas dislike\r\npowdered naphthalene and pyrethrum powder, and either of these may be\r\napplied to the clothes to ward them off.\r\n\r\nA note on the troublesome _Chigger flea_ or _Jigger_ will be found under\r\n“Skin Diseases” (_see_ p. 228).\r\n\r\n_Bed-Bugs._—The traveller sleeping in hotels or inns abroad is very apt\r\nto be attacked by bed-bugs, which harbour in wooden beds and bedding,\r\ncrevices in walls, floors and ceilings, and other places which are dark\r\nand sheltered. Fortunately, so far as is known, the bed-bug does not\r\ncarry any disease, but its bites are annoying, and its presence is a sign\r\nof insanitary conditions. It is difficult to protect oneself against\r\nbed-bugs without instituting a campaign against their hiding-places and\r\nbreeding-places, but a skin ointment like vermijelli is useful, and\r\npowdered naphthalene or Keating’s powder may deter the insects to some\r\nextent.\r\n\r\n_Note._—Keating’s powder, which contains pyrethrum, is slow in its\r\neffects, and therefore, if possible, should be shaken over the sleeping\r\nbag or blankets some hours before bedtime. If not, the pests will\r\nstruggle through it and find renewed vigour on the sleeper. It is best\r\nin very bad quarters to rub the powder on the skin as well as to dust it\r\nover the bed. It will not kill a full-grown bug under an hour, but it is\r\nextraordinarily effective with fleas. It is important to obtain a good\r\npyrethrum powder, as such preparations are frequently adulterated.\r\n\r\nThe _Itch Insect_ is the cause of the skin disease known as scabies. It\r\nis a mite, the female of which burrows under the skin to lay her eggs.\r\nThe favourite site for her operations is between the fingers, but other\r\nparts of the body may be affected, and the rash produced may assume\r\nvarious forms, so that it is well in the case of any skin eruption in the\r\ntropics to remember the possibility of scabies.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Its effective treatment is by no means easy, and would take\r\nmuch too long to detail here. All that can be said is that the skin\r\nshould be washed well with soap and hot water, and that thereafter a\r\nliberal quantity of sulphur ointment should be thoroughly rubbed into the\r\nskin twice daily for three days. On the fourth day recourse should be\r\nhad again to soap and hot water, if possible in the form of a hot bath.\r\nMeanwhile, clothing and bedding should be boiled or destroyed.\r\n\r\n_Ticks._—The most important tick from the traveller’s point of view,\r\nat least, in Africa, is the species responsible for the transmission\r\nof tick fever (_see_ p. 242). It would seem that the fowl tick may\r\noccasionally attack man, and some believe that it may spread the\r\ninfection of certain kinds of relapsing fever (_see_ p. 218). The larval\r\nstages of certain ticks are often very troublesome in many parts of the\r\nworld, owing to their habit of burrowing into the skin of persons coming\r\ninto contact with them.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—When a larval tick is found half buried in the skin, force\r\nshould not be used in an attempt to remove it, because either the\r\nsurrounding skin is unnecessarily damaged or, as is most probable, the\r\nhead of the tick is ruptured, its rostrum or beak remaining buried in the\r\nskin. The result is severe irritation which may lead to septic infection.\r\nThe best way, therefore, of dealing with a tick larva lodged in the skin\r\nis to dip a small camel’s hair brush in turpentine, benzene, petrol or\r\nparaffin, and apply it between the skin and the under surface of the\r\ntick. In a short time the tick will let go its hold and may be swept from\r\nthe skin with the brush. Vaseline is also effective if smeared over the\r\ntick. To remove a rostrum which remains in the skin after a tick has been\r\nforcibly ejected, cocaine should be applied to the spot, and the rostrum\r\nextracted with needle forceps, iodine being thereafter applied. A special\r\nform of tick-case devised for dealing with this condition is upon the\r\nmarket, and is a useful addition to the traveller’s outfit.\r\n\r\n_Ants._—These are often very troublesome owing to their depredations on\r\nfoodstuffs, and it must be remembered that experimentally ants have been\r\nshown capable of carrying the organisms of typhoid fever and cholera,\r\nthough under ordinary conditions they are not likely to be very dangerous\r\nin this respect. Some form of pyrethrum powder, such as Keating’s, will\r\nbe found useful in checking the depredations of ants, or they can be\r\nprevented from getting at food on tables by tying paraffin-soaked rags\r\nround the legs of the latter. Powdered borax or paraffin are useful in\r\ndealing with so-called “ant-routes” into tents or houses.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Iritis, or Inflammation of the Eyeball Itself._\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._—In this there is pain, the vision is dimmed, and the\r\ntransparent part of the eye is found to be cloudy. Skilled assistance is\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Apply hot fomentations and boric acid lotion; leeches\r\nor a blister to the temples are of service, and the pupil, which is\r\ncontracted, should be dilated by dropping two or three drops of a one\r\nper cent. solution of atropine on to the eye twice a day or oftener\r\ntill it is well dilated; only enough drops should be applied afterwards\r\nto prevent the pupil from contracting. Dark glasses may be worn with\r\nadvantage. The bowels should be kept well open, and one grain of calomel\r\nmay be given three times a day for a week, or longer if it does not cause\r\na coppery taste in the mouth, with tenderness of the gums and excessive\r\nflow of the saliva. As the inflammation subsides a shade may be adopted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\n_Night blindness and snow blindness_ are due to exposure to the glare\r\neither of the sun or of the snow. To avoid these complaints tinted\r\nglasses should be worn. Travellers in snowy regions should be provided\r\nwith smoked glasses; if these get broken or lost, some opaque substance\r\nmay be smeared over the surface of an ordinary pair, leaving a narrow\r\nhorizontal slit of clear glass—in the Esquimaux fashion, as shown in\r\nthe accompanying illustration. On snow it must be remembered that the\r\nperforated wire gauze sides are essential for protection from the\r\nreflected rays of the sun. Elastic may be substituted with advantage for\r\nthe ordinary metallic attachments, between the glasses as well as around\r\nthe head.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Jaundice._\r\n\r\nJaundice, which is a condition in which the skin and mucous membranes\r\nassume a yellow colour, may be due to various causes. One of the\r\ncommonest forms is that known as catarrhal jaundice, which is induced\r\nby chill, exposure, dietetic disturbances, etc. It should be treated\r\nby calomel and salines. Violent purges are to be avoided. Bismuth and\r\nbicarbonate of soda should be given, and the diet should be regulated\r\nand should consist of simple and bland articles of food, free, as far as\r\npossible, from fats.\r\n\r\nThere is a form of jaundice associated with infective conditions, such as\r\nthe enteric fevers, dysentery, malaria, relapsing fever and yellow fever.\r\nIn these cases the jaundice is to be treated like the catarrhal form, and\r\nthe accompanying condition requires attention.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above there is a camp or infectious jaundice, the\r\nnature of which is somewhat obscure, but which is associated with a\r\nconsiderable degree of illness.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._—The condition commonly begins with shivering, a rise of\r\ntemperature, headache, giddiness, general malaise, sleeplessness, loss of\r\nappetite, nausea, and it may be vomiting. The tongue is coated, and there\r\nmay be pains in the back and legs. The jaundice usually lasts from seven\r\nto nine days, and about the fifth day the temperature falls, though there\r\nmay be a secondary fever.\r\n\r\n_Prophylaxis._—So far as we know at present this is a question of\r\nenforcing good sanitary surroundings, and paying special attention to the\r\nhygiene of food and drinks, which should be guarded from the access of\r\nflies.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—This is entirely symptomatic and should be that of any\r\nordinary febrile attack, together with the measures employed in catarrhal\r\njaundice. There is a severe form of jaundice of an infective nature\r\nwhich is associated with the presence of a parasite in the blood, very\r\nlike that of yellow fever, and which apparently is derived from infected\r\nrats. This form of jaundice is, however, not very common and need not be\r\nfurther considered, especially as it requires skilled medical attendance.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Laryngitis, or Inflammation of the Upper Part of the Windpipe._\r\n\r\nThe organ of the voice is called the “larynx.”\r\n\r\nWhen the windpipe is affected it is somewhat tender on pressure, there is\r\nhoarseness, cough, and pain in swallowing. Treatment similar to that for\r\ncold in the head may be adopted; in addition, the upper part of the front\r\nof the throat should be kept well poulticed for a day or two, and then\r\nwrapped up in cotton wool for some days longer. A piece of mustard leaf\r\ncovered with six layers of a handkerchief and secured by a bandage, can\r\nusually be borne for a considerable time, and is often more efficacious\r\nthan the poultice; when the smarting is great the mustard leaf should be\r\nremoved and the tender part smeared with oil or vaseline.\r\n\r\nInhalations of steam are of use in promoting expectoration. Carbonate of\r\nammonia, three grains, or bicarbonate of potash, five grains, with half\r\nto two grains of ipecacuanha, will help to promote secretion from the\r\naffected part. A teaspoonful of Friar’s balsam in a pint of hot water\r\nmakes a good inhalation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Leeches._\r\n\r\nPersons travelling in India, Ceylon, the Far East generally, and the\r\nPhilippine Islands, are likely to make the acquaintance of the Asiatic\r\nleech, which is a very troublesome and indeed dangerous species of\r\nvermin. It is very small, only about an inch long, and of the thickness\r\nof a knitting-needle. It is able to penetrate through the interstices in\r\nclothing, and when in vast numbers it is a foe difficult to combat. The\r\nbites of these leeches are painless and much blood may be lost before\r\ntheir presence is discovered. It is very difficult to obtain any kind of\r\nboot or puttee which will keep these creatures at bay, and the traveller\r\nin these countries should be provided with a solution of salt or weak\r\nacid which, on application, causes the leeches to loose their hold.\r\nIt is a mistake to try and drag them off the skin, as parts of their\r\nbiting apparatus are apt to be left behind and set up inflammation and\r\nsuppuration. Tincture of iodine should be applied to the site of a leech\r\nbite. In forest regions where these leeches abound protective measures\r\nmust be taken at night, the best being the use of a properly adjusted\r\nmosquito net of very fine mesh.\r\n\r\nThe tropical water leech is found in the Azores, the Canary Islands,\r\nAfrica, Palestine, Syria, Armenia and Turkestan. It may reach a length of\r\nfour inches, and if swallowed with drinking water usually fastens on the\r\nmucous membrane of the mouth or throat. As a preventive measure drinking\r\nwater should be passed through a piece of muslin or similar form of\r\nsieve.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Leishmaniasis._\r\n\r\nThis condition is named after Sir William Leishman, who discovered the\r\nparasite producing it. There is a general and febrile form of the disease\r\nand also a form attacking the skin and mucous membrane of the mouth and\r\nnose, which is considered under Skin Diseases.\r\n\r\nThe systemic form of the disease is commonly known as kala-azar, which\r\nsignifies “black sickness.” It is common in certain parts of India,\r\nnotably Assam, but is found also throughout the Far East, and it occurs\r\nin Arabia, in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan and in the Mediterranean area. A\r\ncase has also been described in South America, in parts of which it is\r\npossibly more common than is generally supposed.\r\n\r\n_Cause._—The parasite, which lives in the blood and tissues, is known,\r\nbut its exact method of transmission to man is still in the realm of\r\nuncertainty.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._—The disease begins in an indefinite manner and then assumes\r\nthe form of a continued fever, associated with enlargement of the spleen\r\nand liver and progressive emaciation. Bleeding from the nose is not\r\nuncommon, and in Europeans the peculiar earthy-grey colour of the skin is\r\nvery striking. The disease lasts for months and even years and is very\r\nfrequently fatal.\r\n\r\n_Prophylaxis._—As we do not know how the disease is spread it is not\r\neasy to recommend preventive measures, and all that can be said is that\r\nevery care should be taken to isolate the sick, to live under healthy\r\nconditions and to avoid contact with vermin of all kinds. As dogs may\r\npossibly be carriers of the disease they should be destroyed if proved\r\ninfected.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Antimony is the best and indeed the sole remedy, but it can\r\nbe given only by a medical man, so that nothing further need be said here\r\nregarding it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Liver, Congestion of_:—\r\n\r\nThe _Liver_, which is mainly on the right side, lies below the right\r\nlung, and is protected by the lower ribs. In health it extends vertically\r\nfrom one-and-a-half inches below the right nipple to the lower edge of\r\nthe ribs; in certain diseases it is enlarged, and its edge can be felt\r\nwell below the ribs.\r\n\r\nCongestion of the liver is frequent in the tropics, and is often due to\r\nmalaria or dysentery. Very frequently it is caused by abuse of alcohol,\r\nover-indulgence in food, and the excessive use of hot condiments, or\r\nby constipation and want of exercise. In the tropics the liver is more\r\neasily affected by excesses than in temperate climates.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._—A furred tongue, sallowness of the face, headache, lassitude,\r\ndisinclination for work, loss of appetite, tendency to vomit, occasional\r\nslight jaundice, and a sense of oppression about the region of the liver.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Light diet, abstinence from alcohol and spices, and the\r\nuse of calomel or other aperient will usually effect a cure. Ammonium\r\nchloride, five to ten grains, three times a day, should be given.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Liver, Acute Inflammation of_:—\r\n\r\nIn this complaint there is severe pain, some fever, and frequently\r\njaundice. The complaint is serious, as abscess of the liver frequently\r\nfollows it, at least if it is due to amœbic dysentery.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—The patient should be put to bed, hot fomentations applied\r\nto the seat of pain, and the bowels well relieved. Emetine should be at\r\nonce administered as for dysentery, or ten grains of ipecacuanha should\r\nbe given three times a day. Ammonium chloride in full doses (twenty\r\ngrains three times a day) often does good, and can be retained when\r\nipecacuanha cannot, but it is unpleasant to take, so the dose should\r\nbe given in one or two ounces of water. The wisest course for one who\r\nhas had a severe inflammation of the liver is to get away to a healthy\r\nclimate.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Liver Abscess._\r\n\r\nIt is extremely difficult for the traveller to decide if abscess of\r\nthe liver is present; it may be suspected if a patient, convalescent\r\nfrom dysentery, still remains feeble and ill, or if he has an irregular\r\ntemperature, a muddy complexion, night sweats, wasting, and pain or\r\nuneasiness in the right shoulder. Sometimes a definite swelling can be\r\nmade out. A dry cough is not uncommon.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Emetine is the specific treatment for the prevention of\r\nliver abscess, and it would seem in some cases actually able to bring\r\nabout a cure even when the abscess has formed. It should be given as\r\nfor amœbic dysentery (p. 187), and it is essential that a patient with\r\nliver abscess should as soon as possible come under medical control, as\r\nit may be necessary to give emetine by the needle subcutaneously or even\r\nto inject it into the abscess cavity. Ammonium chloride may be given;\r\nthe patient’s strength must be supported, and he should be as quickly as\r\npossible placed under the care of a surgeon, who will probably decide\r\nto operate. If this cannot be done, then the patient should not be\r\ninterfered with surgically, for he will have a better chance of recovery\r\nif the abscess is allowed to burst naturally than he would if the\r\ntraveller attempted to operate.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Malaria._\r\n\r\nOf all diseases in the tropics malaria is the one which is most likely\r\nto trouble the traveller. Hence it is essential that he should be well\r\nposted regarding it. In addition to the books which have already been\r\nindicated he will find the recently published ‘Malaria at Home and\r\nAbroad,’ by Colonel S. P. James, a work of much value and interest.\r\nIt is true it is more especially intended for the medical man, but\r\nany intelligent layman can study it with interest and profit, and the\r\nchapters dealing with prophylaxis and treatment are specially valuable\r\nand well up to date. Here it is possible to give only a mere outline of\r\nthe chief facts concerning the disease.\r\n\r\n1. Malarial fever is caused by a small animal parasite which lives\r\nchiefly in the blood of patients attacked by it. 2. Under ordinary\r\nconditions in nature it can be conveyed only from one person to another\r\nby the bite of a mosquito which has previously sucked the blood of an\r\ninfected person. 3. The parasite undergoes a series of changes in the\r\nmosquito’s body and eventually finds its way to the salivary glands\r\nof the insect whence it is injected through the mosquito’s proboscis\r\ninto another victim. 4. There are only certain species of mosquitoes,\r\nbelonging to the family Anophelinæ (from a Greek word signifying\r\n“harmful”), which can carry malaria, and it is only the females of these\r\nspecies which are affected as the males are not blood-suckers. Anopheline\r\nmosquitoes breed in shallow puddles and in almost all collections of\r\nstagnant or gently flowing water. It is therefore very dangerous to pitch\r\ncamps close to stagnant pools, sluggish reed-grown streams or marshy\r\nplaces. 5. In the tropics one of the chief reservoirs of infection is the\r\nnative, and more especially the native child, who frequently harbours the\r\nmalarial parasite in the form which is adapted for life and reproduction\r\nin the mosquito and hence is a distinct source of danger. It is therefore\r\ninadvisable to camp in the vicinity of native villages or to spend a\r\nnight in the neighbourhood of native habitations unless efficiently\r\nprotected from the bites of mosquitoes.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._—Malarial fever presents itself under two chief forms,\r\nthough it should be noted that malaria is one of the most protean of\r\nall diseases and may simulate any malady. (1) _Intermittent_ fever. In\r\nthis disease the temperature may rise high, but returns each day to\r\nnormal or lower; hence there is, after each attack, a period of complete\r\nfreedom from fever. An intermittent fever or ague is usually less serious\r\nthan a remittent fever, but it is harder to cure in the long run. (2)\r\n_Remittent_ fever. In this the temperature, though it varies, keeps\r\nconstantly above the normal, and the higher the fever, and the slighter\r\nthe difference between the extremes of temperature, the more serious\r\nis the condition of the patient. Where the temperature is remittent,\r\nand appears to be unaffected by quinine, the disease is probably not\r\nmalarial, but may be a case of enteric fever, and should be treated as\r\nadvised below under that heading.\r\n\r\nThe attack may be sudden, but it is usually preceded by a feeling of\r\nlanguor, yawning, and general discomfort; this is followed by the _cold\r\nstage_, which, in the tropics, is usually short, and in the more ordinary\r\nattacks is ushered in by a violent shivering fit or rigor, though this\r\nis not common in Central Africa. The sensation of cold is entirely\r\nsubjective, for though the patient feels chilly and piles clothes upon\r\nhimself his temperature will be found elevated. At this period violent\r\nvomiting is not infrequent. Then comes the _hot stage_, often of long\r\nduration, followed by the _sweating stage_, during which the perspiration\r\npours from the patient and soaks everything on and about him. After this\r\nthere is a period of remission, or intermission of the feverish symptoms\r\nwith corresponding relief to the patient. Usually, after some hours, the\r\nattack comes on again, beginning with the cold stage, but if the fever is\r\ntreated very early, the disease may now pass off. The whole attack lasts\r\nas a rule from six to ten hours, say one hour for the cold stage, three\r\nor four for the hot period, and two to four for that of defervescence.\r\nThere is sometimes a feeling of pain and discomfort in the right side\r\nowing to the congestion of the spleen, which enlarges during the rigor.\r\n\r\nThere are three distinct species of malarial parasite, and each causes\r\na different type of fever. According to the type with which the patient\r\nhas become infected, the fever recurs after one, two, or three days. At\r\nthe same time all kinds of febrile irregularities are met with, so that\r\nit is often impossible to diagnose the disease in the absence of blood\r\nexamination for the detection of the parasite.\r\n\r\nAnæmia is a constant feature of the malarial attack, as is but natural,\r\nconsidering the great destruction of red blood cells brought about by the\r\nparasites which have infected them.\r\n\r\n_Prophylaxis._—Only those preventive measures which can be put into\r\noperation by the individual will be here considered. This may be called\r\n_personal prophylaxis_. By far the most important means of avoiding\r\nmalaria is the proper use of an efficient mosquito net. The oblong\r\ntype is best, and it should contain sixteen meshes to the linear inch.\r\nRound the foot of it should be sewn a stout layer of calico 2 feet in\r\ndepth. This will permit of a foot of the material being tucked under the\r\nmattress while the upper foot remains in the form of a belt or zone round\r\nthe bed. It is necessary, because in its absence the sleeper is very\r\nliable to be bitten through the mosquito-net mesh, with which his arms\r\nor legs are apt to come in contact. Care must be taken to see that the\r\nnet is kept in good repair—a most important matter—and in very malarious\r\ncountries it is advisable to provide every member of an expedition,\r\nnative or otherwise, with a good mosquito net. In what may be called the\r\ndry tropics, the top of the net may be of mesh; in the moist tropics, it\r\nis best made of calico in order to keep off the heavy dews. The traveller\r\noften sleeps out on the deck of river steamers, and then it is certainly\r\nadvantageous to have the roof of the net composed of stout calico, as\r\nsparks from the funnel are very apt to alight upon it, and naturally\r\nholes will be burnt much more readily in mesh than in thick cotton. It is\r\nfoolish to sleep even for one night in a malarious locality unprotected\r\nby a net.\r\n\r\nThe net is for use during the period of sleep, but one is very apt to be\r\nbitten by infected mosquitoes just after sunset, and hence it is well to\r\nmake use of some form of mosquito canopy. A good type is the so-called\r\nmosquito umbrella tent. Such a canopy may be arranged so that the evening\r\nmeal can be taken in it. One servant will be inside the canopy and\r\nreceive the dishes through a guarded opening from the attendant outside.\r\n\r\nOther methods of protection exist in the shape of mosquito boots or\r\nbuskins. The best type of mosquito boot is the form which reaches right\r\nup the thigh. They may be made of untanned leather or of stout khaki\r\ncloth. All mosquito boots and buskins should be provided with soles to\r\nprotect the feet from wet and damp. In the absence of boots it is well to\r\nknow that a mosquito will not bite through two pairs of stockings, one\r\nsuper-imposed over the other. This is a way in which women can protect\r\ntheir legs and ankles, or they can employ the buskin, leggings, gaiters,\r\nor puttees.\r\n\r\nMosquito veils have been mentioned, the best type being the “Mosquinette”\r\nhood.\r\n\r\nMosquitoes are apt to bite through chairs with cane seats or with\r\nperforated seats, and these should be guarded by a layer of brown paper,\r\nnewspaper, or a cushion.\r\n\r\nRepellent substances may be used, smeared on the skin. They contain\r\nessential oils, such as oil of cassia or eucalyptus oil. These repellents\r\nare effective only for a short time, but lessen in some degree the\r\nliability to infection.\r\n\r\nThe prophylactic use of quinine has recently fallen somewhat into\r\ndisrepute, owing to its comparative failure in many of the war areas,\r\nbut there can be no doubt that under conditions of civil life it is a\r\nvaluable auxiliary method, if properly employed. One of the troubles\r\nabout it is that quinine is rapidly excreted from the body, and hence\r\nafter a dose it remains in the blood only a comparatively short time; for\r\nexample, if the dose be taken at 6 p.m. it is very doubtful if enough\r\nquinine will be left in the blood at 2 o’clock in the morning to kill any\r\nmalarial spores which may be introduced into it by an infected mosquito.\r\nThe ideal method of taking quinine prophylactically would be to take a\r\ndose of 5 or 6 grains with the evening meal shortly before sunset. This\r\nwill protect until it is time to get under the mosquito net. If for any\r\nreason it is impossible to employ the latter, then a second dose of\r\nquinine should be taken at midnight. This is difficult to accomplish,\r\nand hence something may be gained by taking a larger dose of quinine\r\nat night on the chance that some of it may remain in the blood for a\r\nlonger period than would the smaller quantity. As much as 10 grains may\r\ntherefore be taken under these conditions. Some persons, however, cannot\r\nstand 10 grains of quinine daily for a long period of time.\r\n\r\nIt is clear from what has been said that prophylactic quinine should\r\nnever be taken in the morning, and also that it is merely an auxiliary\r\nmethod, and does not do away with the necessity of using the mosquito\r\nnet. Sugar-coated tablets should be avoided, and care must be taken to\r\nsee that the products or tablets which may be used are readily soluble.\r\nIt is a good plan to crack the products before swallowing them. A good\r\nsalt of quinine is the bisulphate, which is soluble and comparatively\r\ncheap. When the drug is given in powder, tablet, or pill form, it should\r\nbe followed by a wine-glassful of water, and it is advisable to acidify\r\nthe latter by a few drops of hydrochloric acid. There is no doubt that\r\nas a general rule quinine is best taken in solution, but in the case\r\nof persons travelling about this is not always easy to arrange, and if\r\nthe above precautions be taken the solid form will generally be found\r\neffective. It is better to take prophylactic quinine in daily doses,\r\nbecause if an interval is allowed to elapse between doses one is apt to\r\nforget to take the drug at the proper time. Hence it is well to make it\r\na kind of ritual to take the quinine along with the evening meal, for\r\nit is certainly an advantage to do so on a full stomach. It should be\r\nremembered that persons who take their quinine regularly do not suffer\r\nfrom blackwater fever, while the irregular taking of quinine certainly\r\nappears to favour the occurrence of the latter. It is better not to take\r\nprophylactic quinine at all than to take it in a haphazard and irregular\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—The three great principles of treatment are: (1) To open\r\nthe bowels; (2) to produce perspiration; (3) to give quinine. The\r\nroutine to be adopted is as follows. Put the patient to bed in flannel\r\npyjamas, and covered up well with blankets; in all cases, save where\r\nthere is diarrhœa, give an aperient, such as four grains of calomel, or\r\ntwo tabloids of Cathartic Co, or two Livingstone’s Rousers, and if this\r\ndoes not act, repeat the dose in about four hours. If free evacuation\r\nis not produced, a warm-water enema should be given. A hot-water bottle\r\nin bed is useful. Sponging with warm water often gives relief at the\r\nbeginning of a fever, and tends to shorten the cold stage. At the same\r\ntime hot drinks should be given, such as weak tea, in order to promote\r\nperspiration and cut short the hot stage, and at this stage, _i.e._,\r\nat the outset of the fever, 10 grains of Antipyrin, or 10 grains of\r\nPhenacetin, may be found useful for inducing perspiration, or four\r\ntablets of Warburg’s Tincture, which contains some quinine, may be\r\nsubstituted for them. Antipyrin and Phenacetin should not be given except\r\nin the earliest stages of the fever.\r\n\r\nDuring the hot stage cold applications, such as cloths wrung out of cold\r\nor iced water and sprinkled with eau de cologne, vinegar or spirit may\r\nbe applied to the forehead and behind the ears. The bed-clothes should\r\nbe lightened and drink freely supplied, unless it seems to promote\r\nvomiting. If the temperature shows signs of getting above 105° F.\r\nsponge the patient with warm water or cradle the bed-clothes, as it is\r\ncalled—that is, remove them from contact with the body by some simple\r\nmeans. In the sweating stage strip off the soaked pyjamas and sheets and\r\nget the patient into warm, well-aired night-clothes and bed-clothes. If\r\nthere is any tendency to collapse a little stimulant may be given—say, a\r\ndessertspoonful of brandy. In most cases alcohol is better avoided. If\r\nvomiting is bad withhold all food, and give bits of ice to suck if it can\r\nbe obtained.\r\n\r\nWhilst the above methods of treatment are important, it should be clearly\r\nrecognised that the one drug which can alone counteract the malarial\r\naffection is quinine, and it is upon the proper administration of quinine\r\nthat successful treatment largely depends.\r\n\r\nThis proper administration necessitates at the outset rest in bed,\r\nand it also necessitates a continuance of the drug for a sufficient\r\nlength of time. For ordinary cases the best way is to give quinine by\r\nthe mouth, and here again it is best given in solution, though it can\r\nbe administered in solid form if the precautions above indicated are\r\nduly observed. Various doses have been advocated, but probably the best\r\nquantity to administer is 30 grains every twenty-four hours. This is\r\nusually given in three doses of 10 grains each, but there would appear to\r\nbe an advantage in giving four doses instead of three, and Colonel James\r\nadvocates the following times for administration, _i.e._ 12 midnight, 6\r\na.m., 12 noon, 6 p.m. He does so, because such a method of administration\r\nis likely to ensure that there shall be a sufficient concentration of\r\nquinine in the blood at the time when the youngest forms of the parasite\r\nare present. The patient should remain in bed, if possible, for ten\r\ndays, or, if this is impossible, for at least half that period; and it is\r\nessential that the quinine should be given as soon as possible, and quite\r\nirrespective of the stage of the attack or the height of the fever. If\r\nits administration is followed by vomiting, give a small teaspoonful of\r\nbicarbonate of soda in warm water. If this is rejected repeat the dose,\r\nand then give some form of stomach sedative, such as bismuth, and dilute\r\nhydrocyanic acid or 20 drops of chlorodyne. A mustard leaf applied to the\r\npit of the stomach is often helpful. Sometimes drop doses of tincture\r\nof iodine, well diluted, will check these troublesome symptoms. Under\r\nordinary conditions this 30-grain quinine treatment should be steadily\r\ncontinued for at least five days, but in troublesome cases it may be\r\nnecessary to carry on with it for as long as three weeks. Thereafter what\r\nis called the “after treatment” is begun and must be continued for a\r\nperiod of three months, in order to ensure, if possible, an eradication\r\nof the infection.\r\n\r\nThere are several ways of carrying out this after treatment, but one of\r\nthe simplest and most effective is to administer 10 grains of quinine\r\nevery day, the dose being taken an hour or two before the time at which\r\nthe fever was apt to come on during the attack.\r\n\r\nIf, despite quinine treatment, relapses occur, the patient must go to\r\nbed and be treated as for the first attack, and the after treatment must\r\nagain be carefully carried out.\r\n\r\nUnder certain conditions quinine has to be injected by the needle, either\r\ninto the muscles or into a vein; but, as a rule, this should not be done\r\nsave by the medical attendant. It should, however, be remembered that\r\nthe drug may be given by the bowel, in which case twice the quantity of\r\nquinine which would be administered by the mouth should be given. It is\r\nonly exceptionally that this procedure will have to be followed, but it\r\nis sometimes useful in the case of children.\r\n\r\nThe feeding of the malaria patient is important. Between the attacks of\r\nfever, or during the sweating stage, he should be given food in fluid\r\nform, such as chicken broth, eggs beaten up with milk, raisin tea, etc.;\r\nand as soon as his stomach will stand it, the diet should be increased.\r\nTonics, such as iron and arsenic, are required during convalescence.\r\n\r\nIn cases where there is acute malarial poisoning, with temperature 106°\r\nF., or even higher, do not wait to undress the patient or get a bath; but\r\nempty gallons of water over him, one boy keeping the head constantly\r\nsoused; while this is being done a bath can be procured and the patient\r\nthen undressed, or, better still, have his clothes cut off, because it\r\nis dangerous to lift such a patient about too much. Remember that when a\r\npatient is very ill and weak, he should not be allowed to stand or sit up\r\nsuddenly, as he may faint.\r\n\r\nDelirium with high temperature, say 106° F. or over, is a certain sign\r\nthat the fever is doing harm, and must be reduced.\r\n\r\nThe temperature and pulse should be carefully watched when the cold water\r\ntreatment is employed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Malta Fever._ (See _Undulant Fever._)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Measles._\r\n\r\nIncubation period, ten days. Rash occurs on the fourth day.\r\n\r\n_Rash._—Pink spots, round or irregular, slightly raised above the\r\nsurface, tending to run together in patches over the body, leaving the\r\nunaffected skin between them clear. In the early stages often best marked\r\non the face and behind the ears.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._—Fever, catarrh, congested eyes, running from the nose,\r\nsickness and cough.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Similar to that of scarlet fever (_see_ p. 222). It is very\r\nimportant to guard against chill; to ensure plenty of fresh air.\r\n\r\n_Complications._—Measles may be followed by pneumonia.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mumps._\r\n\r\nThis is an infectious disease, characterised by swelling of the salivary\r\nglands. Its chief importance to the traveller is that if once it makes\r\nits appearance it may spread rapidly through his native attendants, and\r\nthat it is apt to be followed by inflammation of the testicle.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._—The invasion is accompanied by fever, which is usually\r\nslight, but is sometimes severe. There is pain just below the ear on one\r\nside, followed by a swelling which gradually increases, causing great\r\nenlargement of the neck and side of the cheek. In a day or two the other\r\nside of the face is usually affected, and sometimes the condition spreads\r\nunder the lower jaw. It persists from seven to ten days, then gradually\r\nsubsides. Inflammation of the testicle may be troublesome. It is usually\r\none-sided.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Rest in bed during the height of the disease. Get the\r\nbowels freely open and keep the patient on a light diet. No medicine is\r\nrequired unless the fever is high. Either cold or hot applications may be\r\nmade to the swelling. If the testicle is involved it should be treated by\r\nrest and protection with cotton wool.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Myiasis._\r\n\r\nThis is the name applied to the condition in which the larvæ of flies are\r\nfound parasitic in the body. It may be cutaneous, nasal or intestinal.\r\nThe last named is not of great importance. Different species of flies may\r\nbe concerned; thus in Africa, one of the best known flies producing this\r\ncondition is called on the West Coast the _Tumbu fly_. The fly itself is\r\nabout the size of a small blue-bottle, and is yellowish-grey in colour.\r\nIt has a fat white larva, which burrows under the skin and produces a\r\nsmall boil or wheal, in the centre of which there is an opening which,\r\nunless blocked up by discharge, looks black owing to the presence of\r\nexcrement from the posterior end of the larva. The skin round the hole\r\nbecomes inflamed and very itchy. The commonest site is the forearm, but\r\nin Europeans various parts of the body may be attacked.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—When small the larvæ can easily be squeezed out. They are,\r\nhowever, best extracted with forceps, and this is more readily done if a\r\nlittle chloroform is injected into the maggot before it is removed. Apply\r\nlocal sedatives, such as lead and opium and, after removal of the maggot,\r\npaint the skin with iodine. Indeed, if there is some delay in getting the\r\nmaggot removed, it is well to apply tincture of iodine to the skin to\r\nprevent the occurrence of suppuration.\r\n\r\nIn Central and South America we meet with the so-called _Ver macaque_,\r\nwhich is the larva of another species of fly, and which gets under the\r\nskin in much the same way as does that of the Tumbu fly. It causes a\r\ngreat deal of pain, especially when it is moving about. It should be\r\ntreated on the same lines as above.\r\n\r\nThe _Screw-worm_ is also met with in America, and is the maggot of a fly\r\nwhich lays its eggs on the surface of wounds and in the ears and nose of\r\npersons sleeping in the open air. The maggots burrow into the tissues and\r\nmay bring about a very serious condition if not detected at an early date\r\nand removed.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Injections of chloroform are one of the best ways of getting\r\nrid of maggots in the ear or nose, but medical attention is required.\r\nWounds should be protected and kept clean. If infected they may be\r\ntreated with turpentine, a painful but effective method.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ophthalmia, Simple._\r\n\r\nSimple ophthalmia, conjunctivitis, or inflammation of the membrane\r\ncovering the eye and the inner side of the eyelids, is usually due to\r\ncold or dust.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._—The affected eye is bloodshot and painful, waters freely, and\r\ncannot bear a bright light; there is a feeling of grittiness, as if the\r\ntrouble were due to something between the eye and eyelid.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—The eye should be carefully washed, the eyelids being\r\nopened and clean, cold water allowed to run over them and over the eye;\r\nany particles of dust must be removed—for this purpose a small clean\r\ncamel-hair brush will be found useful. A lotion should be made consisting\r\nof six grains of boric acid, or two grains of sulphate of zinc, to an\r\nounce of water, and ten drops or more of this should be dropped on to the\r\neyeball six or eight times a day. To prevent the lids sticking together\r\nduring the night, they should be smeared with vaseline or a salve\r\ncontaining 4 grains of calomel to an ounce of vaseline. Sometimes hot\r\nfomentations give relief.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ophthalmia, Purulent._\r\n\r\nThis is a more serious inflammation, and is caused by some poison,\r\n_e.g._, germs carried by flies, or by the fingers from unhealthy sores\r\nand discharges. It may also result from injury, such as a septic wound.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._—The symptoms of simple ophthalmia are present, but are all\r\nintensified, the eyelids are swollen and the eyeballs red, there is a\r\ndischarge of yellow matter or pus, and the patient feels ill. There is\r\ngreat danger of the affected eye infecting the sound one, therefore warn\r\nthe patient not to touch the sound eye for fear of infecting it. There is\r\nalso great danger lest the attendant’s own eyes should become infected.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—The patient should be kept in bed and the eyes should be\r\nshielded from bright light. Protect the sound eye (especially when the\r\naffected one is being washed) by placing a pad of wool or lint over it,\r\nkept in its place by strips of strapping so as effectually to close the\r\neye and prevent infection. Thoroughly wash out the space between the\r\neyelids and the eye, and remove any matter or foreign body which may be\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nWhen the inflamed surfaces are clean, wash them very thoroughly with a\r\nsolution of corrosive sublimate, 1 in 5000, and finally smear a little\r\nvaseline along the edges of the lids, to prevent them sticking together.\r\nThis treatment must be repeated as frequently as possible. Once a day\r\nthe inflamed surfaces may be brushed over with a solution of nitrate\r\nof silver, 10 grains to the ounce, applied with a camel’s-hair brush,\r\nfollowed immediately by the application of a few drops of common salt\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\nHot fomentations may give relief. When this is so, the eye should be\r\nkept covered with a pad of moist lint, which must be changed frequently.\r\nBenefit has followed the administration of very large doses of salicylate\r\nof soda.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Piles._\r\n\r\nPiles are very common in the tropics, and are often due to want of\r\nexercise, chronic constipation, dysentery, too free use of alcohol, and\r\nover-eating. No one who suffers from piles should become a traveller till\r\nskilled advice has been obtained.\r\n\r\n_Internal Piles_, though not usually painful, are by their frequent\r\nbleeding a cause of anæmia and debility; they lie inside the orifice of\r\nthe bowel, but sometimes they come down on straining, and are then nipped\r\nby the muscle surrounding the opening, and may swell up, become very\r\npainful, and bleed profusely.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Keep the bowels freely but gently opened by taking\r\ncascara regularly; if the piles come down they should be returned,\r\nand an ointment of galls and opium or an injection of hazeline (one\r\ntablespoonful mixed with seven of water) used. Tannin, five grains to the\r\nounce, or sulphate of iron, three to five grains to the ounce, may be\r\nused instead of hazeline. Hazeline suppositories are often of great use\r\nfor internal piles, but ordinary suppositories do not keep well in very\r\nhot countries; if they are taken to the tropics they should therefore be\r\nspecially made and packed. If the piles bleed profusely or cause great\r\npain, an operation will be necessary.\r\n\r\n_External piles_ do not bleed, but from time to time they become inflamed\r\nand swollen, causing great agony.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—The bowels should be kept well opened; the sufferer should\r\nlie with his hips raised; hot fomentations should be frequently applied,\r\nand the piles should be well greased. Glycerine of belladonna, smeared on\r\na pad of lint, is a valuable application, as is dry calomel powder.\r\n\r\nSome sedative, such as Dover’s powder, may be necessary to procure rest\r\nand sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Plague._\r\n\r\nThere are two chief varieties of plague, the bubonic and the pneumonic.\r\n\r\n_Causes._—Bubonic plague, which is due to a small vegetable organism,\r\nthe _Bacillus pestis_, exists primarily as a disease in rats and other\r\nrodents, such as the Manchurian marmot and the Californian brown\r\nsquirrel, and is transmitted from these animals to man by means of the\r\nflea. It is the rat flea that is chiefly concerned in the spread of\r\nplague. Both the brown and the black rat are affected and, speaking\r\ngenerally, the black rat is the more dangerous, as it lives in closer\r\nassociation with man. It is now known that certain forms of merchandise,\r\nespecially grain and, to a lesser extent, raw cotton, are more to be\r\ndreaded as vehicles of the bubonic plague infection than the infected\r\nhuman being.\r\n\r\nThe flea does not inoculate the bacillus by its bite. It sucks up blood\r\ncontaining plague bacilli. The latter multiply in the insect to such an\r\nextent that they block the entrance of the flea’s stomach and prevent it\r\nfrom feeding. The starved flea makes violent efforts to obtain more blood\r\nand, as a result, the contents of its gullet are discharged, together\r\nwith the plague bacilli, upon the skin of the healthy person on whom it\r\nis trying to feed. If there is any little wound in this skin the bacilli\r\ngain an entrance and they set up the disease. Infection may also occur\r\nfrom the bacilli-containing excreta of the flea being voided on the skin\r\nand rubbed into wounds. When rats become ill or die the fleas leave them\r\nand attack man. It should be noted that the rat flea may remain infective\r\nfor 43 days.\r\n\r\nPneumonic plague, although due to the same bacillus, is quite a\r\ndifferent kind of disease, and is transmitted from the sick to the sound\r\nby droplets of sputum expelled in coughing, and probably also by the\r\ninvisible spray which pneumonia patients discharge from the mouth. When\r\nthe disease is epidemic domestic animals may suffer from it and become\r\nsources of infection.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._—Both forms of plague are characterised by sudden onset, sharp\r\nfever, giddiness, great weakness, a drunken gait, appearance and speech,\r\nand a tendency to heart failure.\r\n\r\nIn bubonic plague there is lassitude, headache and shivering, and the\r\nface is pale and anxious. The patient looks haggard, his eyes are often\r\nbloodshot, and his expression is frequently one of fear or horror. His\r\ntemperature runs up to 102°, 104° F., or even higher, and his face\r\ngets hot and flushed. There is intense thirst, the tongue becomes dry\r\nand brown, the urine is scanty, and there may be delirium. About the\r\nsecond or third day the glandular swellings known as buboes make their\r\nappearance, usually in the groin, but they may occur in the armpits,\r\nthe neck, and elsewhere. As a rule there is only one bubo, which varies\r\nin size. There may be a good deal of pain associated with the swelling,\r\nand sometimes it is very severe. The bubo, if not dealt with surgically,\r\neventually softens and bursts, discharging matter and sloughs. In cases\r\nwhich are going to recover, improvement is noted about the fourth or\r\nfifth day, and is heralded by a profuse perspiration. In fatal cases,\r\ndeath usually takes place between the third and fifth days.\r\n\r\nPneumonic plague usually begins with shivering and vomiting. There is a\r\ncough, accompanied by breathlessness and blueness of the face, the sputum\r\nis profuse, watery and blood-stained, and as it is full of plague bacilli\r\nit is exceedingly dangerous. Very few cases of pneumonic plague recover.\r\n\r\n_Prophylaxis._—Ward off attacks of fleas. A substance called pesterine\r\nis good for this purpose, and consists of kerosene 20 parts, soft soap\r\n1 part, and water 5 parts. Powdered naphthalene and tricresol powder\r\nare useful. Attendants on plague patients should be protected from\r\ninfection. They should wear puttees or gum-boots, gloves, and overalls,\r\nand those looking after pneumonic cases must wear masks, goggles, and\r\noveralls. There is a protective vaccine for plague, and those travelling\r\nin districts where plague is epidemic should avail themselves of its\r\nprotective power.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—The only treatment which is of any value, and this only in\r\nbubonic plague and when given early, is the administration of plague\r\nanti-toxin, which should only be given by a medical man. The symptoms\r\nshould be treated in order to relieve the patient’s distress. Belladonna\r\nand glycerine may be applied to the buboes, and they should be opened\r\nand carefully dressed once suppuration is established. Morphia is often\r\nrequired for the restlessness and insomnia, and cardiac stimulants are\r\nindicated in nearly every case.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pleurisy, or Inflammation of the Membrane Covering the Lung._\r\n\r\nThis is more a disease of cold climates, and is usually the result of\r\nchill following severe exertion.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._—Pleurisy is accompanied by less fever and general sickness\r\nthan pneumonia; its characteristic symptom is the “stitch in the side”,\r\nwhich always accompanies it. There is also a short, dry cough, without\r\nexpectoration, which the patient tries to restrain, as it “catches” in\r\nthe side, and causes acute pain. For the same reason the breathing is\r\nshallow, as any attempt to draw a deep breath causes extreme suffering.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—The patient suffers greatly, therefore in the early stages\r\ntreatment must be directed to the pain. If leeches are procurable,\r\nthe application of half-a-dozen to the painful region of the chest is\r\nadvisable. Mustard leaves or poultices should be applied over the part,\r\nor it may be painted with tincture of iodine; opium may be given to\r\nrelieve the acute pain, in the form of Dover’s powder, fifteen grains\r\nthree times a day. Five grains of quinine may be given twice a day.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pneumonia, or Inflammation of the Lungs._\r\n\r\nIt has been definitely proved that the black races are specially\r\nsusceptible to the organism which is the cause of pneumonia, and it is a\r\nfrequent source of invaliding amongst the native attendants of travellers\r\nin Africa and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n_Causes._—As predisposing factors may be noted change of climate, chill,\r\ninsanitary conditions of life, fatigue, and overwork. Malaria, syphilis,\r\nalcoholism, and excessive tobacco-smoking also play a part. The disease\r\nis believed to be spread by personal contact, but this has not been\r\ndefinitely established.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._—These usually begin with a severe attack of shivering; the\r\ntemperature rises rapidly, the pulse and breathing are greatly quickened,\r\nand the patient is completely prostrated. The face is flushed, the\r\nskin feels hot and dry, and there is a short cough, dry at first, but\r\nafterwards accompanied by expectoration of a moderate quantity of slimy,\r\nrust-coloured, blood-stained, and almost frothless matter. Usually there\r\nis pain on the affected side, which in most eases is the right side of\r\nthe chest, above the liver. In African natives heart failure is very\r\ncommon.\r\n\r\n_Prophylaxis._—In order to prevent the occurrence of pneumonia amongst\r\nnative followers good food should be provided, properly cooked; and it is\r\nimportant to see that they are supplied with sufficient blankets at night\r\nif travelling through cold regions. If it can possibly be avoided natives\r\nfrom hot, humid localities should not be taken to chilly, elevated and\r\nwind-swept places, as under such conditions they are very apt to contract\r\npneumonia. Overcrowding in huts or tents should be avoided, and any sore\r\nthroats which develop should be promptly treated.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—A patient attacked with pneumonia should take to bed at\r\nonce. The affected side should be surrounded with a _large_ poultice.\r\nFive grains of quinine should be given every eight hours. If the heart’s\r\naction is weak, give some preparation of ammonia, as a stimulant, and\r\nadminister alcohol, up to half an ounce, every two hours. Opium should\r\nonly be given to calm the patient, as large doses do harm by checking\r\nfree expectoration; if there is much distress, then ten or fifteen grains\r\nof Dover’s powder may be given.\r\n\r\nAn ice poultice applied to the chest will give great relief by lowering\r\nthe temperature and diminishing the pain (_see_ page 274).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Quinsy, or Inflammation of the Tonsils._\r\n\r\nApply poultices to the neck. Gargle with a hot, weak solution of\r\npermanganate of potash, or a solution of chinosol (1 in 2000), at least\r\nevery hour. Administer quinine and iron as a tonic. Keep the bowels well\r\nopen. Surgical aid is sometimes required in bad cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Relapsing Fever._\r\n\r\nThis is the old “famine fever,” and it occurs in various parts of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n_Causes._—It is due to a corkscrew-shaped blood parasite, which is\r\nconveyed from the sick to the healthy by means of lice. Some hold that\r\ncertain forms of this fever in Palestine, Cilicia, and Persia are\r\ntransmitted by means of the common fowl tick, which often harbours in\r\nthe cracks in native bedsteads and in crevices in the walls of huts and\r\nother dwelling places.\r\n\r\nThe true tick fever of Africa, which is also a relapsing fever, is\r\nconsidered separately. (See _Tick Fever_, p. 241.)\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._—These differ a little in different parts of the world.\r\nThe incubation period is usually from five to ten days. The onset is\r\nremarkably sudden. The patient has a chill or shivering fit, becomes\r\ngiddy, develops a bad frontal headache, feels as if he had been beaten\r\nall over, and frequently vomits. He has often a difficulty in walking,\r\nand soon becomes seriously ill. Delirium is not infrequent. The tongue,\r\nunlike that in typhus fever, remains moist throughout the illness.\r\nThirst, restlessness, and vomiting are very characteristic of the\r\ncondition, and the urine is scanty. As a general rule recovery takes\r\nplace, but sometimes the patient grows gradually worse and dies. As a\r\nrule, however, the temperature falls very suddenly, and the patient is\r\nbetter. After a week or so a relapse occurs. The temperature again shoots\r\nup, and remains up for several days. Then there is a second crisis,\r\nanother relapse, and so on for perhaps three or four times. Most cases\r\nrecover, and once convalescence is established the patient soon gets well.\r\n\r\n_Prophylaxis._—The disease being lice-borne, it is necessary to take all\r\nsteps to prevent contact with these insects (see _Lice_, p. 196). The\r\norganism has been shown to be capable of passing through intact mucous\r\nmembranes and unbroken skin. Hence it is advisable to be careful when\r\nattending a case, for the organism has been found in sweat and tears,\r\nwhile the patient’s blood is, of course, infectious.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Careful nursing and a light diet. Attend to the state of\r\nthe mouth and of the bowels. The arsenic preparation, known as salvarsan\r\n(kharsivan), is a specific remedy, and can cut the disease short; but\r\nit can be administered only by a medical man. Otherwise there is no\r\ntreatment save the symptomatic.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rheumatism._\r\n\r\nThis is a disease which frequently follows exposure to damp and cold, and\r\nis on that account not uncommon in the tropics. It is often hereditary.\r\nAfter one attack, rheumatism is always liable to recur in the same\r\nindividual, and on this account it is necessary that persons liable to\r\nthe disease should use special precautions.\r\n\r\n_Acute rheumatism or Rheumatic Fever._—This is really an infectious\r\ndisease due to a specific organism, and is quite different from the\r\nordinary rheumatism of everyday life.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._—It begins by a shivering fit, with rise of temperature and\r\ngeneral sickness, and the joints, usually wrists, ankles, or knees,\r\nbecome painful, tender, and afterwards swollen. It resembles other\r\nfeverish conditions in the rapid pulse and breathing, the constipation,\r\nscanty and high-coloured urine, etc., but it differs from most of them in\r\nthe presence of a profuse and sour-smelling perspiration, resembling the\r\nodour of butter-milk.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—The best remedy for acute rheumatism is salicylate of soda,\r\nof which fifteen grains should be given every six hours. The joints\r\nshould, at the same time, be kept wrapped up in cotton wool, covered\r\nwith oiled silk and a flannel bandage. This treatment will nearly always\r\ncorrect the acute symptoms in two or three days. If the symptoms subside\r\nsooner, the quantity of the salicylate should be diminished; if there is\r\ndelirium, the dose must be lessened at once, for many people are very\r\nsusceptible to salicylates and are easily affected by them, the delirium\r\nbeing characteristic. Dover’s powder may be given to relieve pain and to\r\nsecure sleep.\r\n\r\n_Chronic rheumatism._—In this disease there is chronic pain and\r\ntenderness of the joints, without fever.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Bicarbonate of potash and salicylate of soda, each in\r\nfive-grain doses, should be given every eight hours. Painful joints may\r\nbe painted with tincture of iodine, rubbed with turpentine liniment, or\r\nbathed with hot water. The bowels should be kept well open, and alcohol\r\nand much meat avoided.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rupture or Hernia._\r\n\r\nA rupture or hernia is a protrusion of some portion of the bowels under\r\nthe skin, and is usually found in the groin. It is generally reducible,\r\n_i.e._, it can be pushed back into the belly. It reappears when the\r\npressure is removed, especially if the patient coughs or strains. When\r\nreduced, a properly-fitting truss should be applied and worn during\r\nthe day. It can be taken off at night, after lying down, but should\r\nbe re-adjusted in the morning, whilst the patient is still in bed. No\r\npatient should go abroad without having an operation for the cure of the\r\nhernia.\r\n\r\nThe great danger of any rupture is that it may become irreducible—a\r\ncondition which is very likely to be followed by constriction or\r\n“strangulation” and subsequent death of the ruptured part of the bowel.\r\nIf unrelieved, this constricted condition is always fatal. The existence\r\nof strangulation is known by local pain and tenderness, development of\r\nsevere colicky pains in the belly (especially about the navel), absolute\r\nconstipation, vomiting, hiccough, and symptoms of collapse. When this\r\ncondition is observed, the patient’s hips should be raised by supporting\r\nthem with pillows, and the tumour should be only very gently kneaded\r\nwith the view of getting back the protruded bowel. The treatment is\r\nconsiderably aided by immersing the patient in a warm bath, and giving\r\nabout twenty drops of laudanum or chlorodyne. Ice placed round the\r\nswelling for half an hour or so is often very effective. If these means\r\nfail, surgical aid is absolutely necessary. _Purgatives should not be\r\ngiven._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sand-Fly Fever._\r\n\r\nThis disease, also known as phlebotomus fever, is very widespread and\r\nprobably occurs in most parts of the world where sand-flies are found.\r\n\r\n_Cause._—The organism is unknown, presumably being too small to be\r\nseen by the highest powers of the microscope, but it is known to be\r\ntransmitted by what are called sand-flies or pappataci flies, tiny and\r\nvery hairy midges which breed in such places as heaps of damp stones,\r\nbricks, and tiles, cracks in surface soil, the walls of old cellars,\r\ncracks and fissures in embankments. These little flies, which sally forth\r\nupon the blood quest towards evening, are voracious blood-suckers, and\r\nfeed principally in the gloaming and at dawn. They chiefly attack the\r\nwrists and ankles, and can easily bite through thin socks or light cotton\r\nor linen clothing. It has been proved that the bite of one infected\r\nfly can convey fever. During the day they hide in dark places, and may\r\nbe found in the dark corners of rooms. Their bites are painful, and\r\nwhen numerous the bitten part may swell badly. An attack by many flies\r\neffectually banishes sleep.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._—The fever is short and sharp—indeed, it is often called the\r\nthree-day fever. The incubation period is four to seven days, and the\r\nattack is sudden, beginning with chilly sensations and a tired feeling.\r\nThere may be rigors, but these are never so severe as the shivering fits\r\nof malaria. The patient becomes giddy, has a severe frontal headache\r\nwith pain at the back of the eyes and pains in the back and legs. The\r\ncondition, indeed, is very like an influenzal attack except that there\r\nis, as a rule, no coryza. The face is flushed and the eyes may be\r\ninjected. When the latter is the case one can understand how the disease\r\nwas originally given the name of the “dog disease,” as the appearance\r\nof the injected conjunctivæ resembles that sometimes seen in mastiffs\r\nand bloodhounds. There may be some sore throat, and sometimes there is a\r\nlittle eruption on the throat or palate. The temperature rises rapidly\r\nand may attain 103° F. It remains up for about twenty-four hours and\r\nthen begins to fall, usually becoming normal on the third or fourth\r\nday. Sometimes there is a secondary rise of temperature. The patient\r\nmay speedily recover or convalescence may be tedious, and the condition\r\nis sometimes followed by mental depression and the digestion may be\r\nupset. The fever is apparently never fatal but it is troublesome and\r\ndebilitating.\r\n\r\n_Prophylaxis._—Protect from the bites of sand-flies. This is best done\r\nby the use of a fine-mesh net containing twenty-two holes to the linear\r\ninch. It should be of the same general pattern as the net recommended\r\nunder malaria (_see_ p. 206). Tobacco smoke keeps the flies away to some\r\nextent and repellents are useful, especially vermijelli, containing some\r\noil of citronella, the preparation known as Sketofax, oil of cassia and\r\noil of eucalyptus. A lump of camphor as a bed-fellow is also useful as\r\nthe flies dislike its odour. The patient should always be placed under a\r\nfine-mesh net to prevent his being a source of infection to others.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Rest in bed, light diet, and one full dose of laudanum,\r\n_i.e._, thirty drops, given as early as possible. Chlorodyne in the same\r\ndose may also be used. Quinine is useless and may aggravate the symptoms,\r\nbut aspirin and the salicylates are helpful. If there is much pain in the\r\nmuscles the application of hot sand-bags may afford relief.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Scarlet Fever, or Scarlatina._\r\n\r\nThis fever is very uncommon in hot climates.\r\n\r\nIncubation period, three to eight days. Rash appears second day.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._—The rash consists of numerous minute red spots, evenly\r\ndistributed all over the surface of the body, upon a general rose-red\r\nblush. The area immediately surrounding the mouth is not affected.\r\nShivering fits, sickness, high temperature, sore throat, headache, pains\r\nin the back. The sickness is very characteristic in children. After the\r\nrash has subsided, _peeling_ of the skin takes place, beginning on the\r\nface as a very fine powdery deposit. The process then spreads to other\r\nparts of the body, the last places to peel being the palms of the hands,\r\nthe soles of the feet, and between the fingers and toes. The peeling\r\nprocess takes from four to six weeks, and the patient is infectious\r\nduring the whole of this period.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Isolation. Bed in an airy room. Light food. If the fever\r\nis high (104° F.), the body may be sponged with tepid water. If the\r\nthroat is very inflamed, an antiseptic gargle should be used. As the\r\ncourse of infectious fevers cannot be cut short, the chief aim of\r\ntreatment should be to avert complications and the return of distressing\r\nsymptoms—over-treatment with drugs must be guarded against.\r\n\r\nTo prevent the spread of infection from the peeling surface, the body\r\nshould be rubbed over with boracic ointment, or carbolic or olive oil.\r\n\r\n_Complications._—As scarlet fever may be followed by heart, kidney, or\r\near trouble, the patient should not be allowed to get up until at least\r\nten days after the temperature has become normal.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Scorpion Sting and Spider Bite._\r\n\r\n_Scorpion sting_ is not infrequent in hot countries, but is very rarely\r\nfatal in the case of the adult European unless several stings have been\r\nreceived at one time.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._—The usual symptoms in the adult are a brawny swelling in the\r\nregion of the sting and more or less collapse. There is often severe pain\r\nof a throbbing nature, and there may be sickness and vomiting.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Apply a tourniquet above the sting and incise the affected\r\narea; then apply an opium lotion. This is usually sufficient to afford\r\nrelief and prevent extension of the swelling. A serum suitable for use in\r\nEgypt and the Sudan only, has been prepared for treating scorpion stings,\r\nand when it is available it should be used as soon as possible, as very\r\nfavourable results have been reported from its employment. It can be\r\nobtained in Cairo or in this country from Messrs. Allen and Hanbury.\r\n\r\n_Spider bite_ is not so important as scorpion sting, though poisonous\r\nspiders do exist in various parts of the world and belong to a genus\r\nfound in Southern Europe, New Zealand, and various parts of North and\r\nSouth America. Many of these poisonous spiders are brightly coloured,\r\ntheir abdomens being spotted with vermilion. In Peru there is a so-called\r\n“pruning-spider,” which belongs to another genus and is also poisonous.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._—Locally a reddish papule appears, and there is sharp stinging\r\npain. The papule is followed by a spreading inflammation which sometimes\r\ngoes on to gangrene, though this is rare. The general symptoms are\r\nthose of nervous exhaustion and there is high fever, rapid pulse, rapid\r\nbreathing, and sometimes blood in the urine.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Apply a ligature and suck the wound. Use permanganate of\r\npotash locally as in the case of snake-bite. The permanganate should also\r\nbe given internally, one-quarter to one per cent. solution being given\r\nevery hour or every two hours. Diffusible stimulants such as ammonia,\r\ncaffeine, or camphor are useful as diuretics. A strict milk diet should\r\nbe enforced during treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Scurvy._\r\n\r\nThis is one of the deficiency diseases. This is not to say that mere\r\ngeneral starvation will produce it, but that it is due to the lack of\r\ncertain substances in the diet. These substances are known to exist in\r\nfresh fruit and vegetables, and also to a lesser extent in fresh meat and\r\nraw milk, but their exact nature has not yet been determined. Travellers\r\nshould remember that, apart from the actual disease, there is a scorbutic\r\nstate in which the symptoms are indefinite, and which, if not recognized\r\nand promptly treated, will pass on to true scurvy.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._—Scurvy begins insidiously with progressive weakness, pallor,\r\nloss of weight, and stiffness in the leg muscles. Later the gums become\r\naffected, soft swellings sprouting up between the teeth. As the disease\r\nprogresses the gums become swollen and spongy, ulcerate and bleed,\r\nwhile in bad cases the mouth becomes very offensive and contains large\r\nfungating masses. Other signs of scurvy are hæmorrhages under the skin\r\nand mucous membrane and in the muscles. Any injury is apt to be followed\r\nby hæmorrhage. Swelling of the legs is an important symptom, especially\r\nin the region of the ankles. If untreated, the condition becomes\r\nworse, the appetite is impaired, mental depression sets in, there is\r\nbreathlessness on exertion, and night and day blindness. Death results\r\nfrom heart failure or some complication.\r\n\r\n_Prophylaxis._—Ensure a good dietary containing sufficient anti-scorbutic\r\nelements. Wherever possible, fresh meat, fresh vegetables, and fresh\r\nfruit should be supplied. Lemon juice is valuable. It should be noted\r\nthat it is four times as efficient as the lime juice which used formerly\r\nto be employed. The ration should be one ounce daily served with sugar.\r\nGerminating peas, beans, and other pulses contain the anti-scorbutic\r\nelements in large quantity. It is a simple matter to carry a supply\r\nof these pulses and to germinate them when required. The dry seeds\r\nmust be whole, retaining their original seed-coat. In order to make\r\nthem germinate they are placed in a clean sack and steeped in a vessel\r\ncontaining clean water, which should be occasionally stirred. Sack and\r\ntrough should be large enough to allow for the swelling of the pulses to\r\nabout three times their original size. In a hot climate six to twelve\r\nhours is sufficient for this soaking. Thereafter, lift the seeds out\r\nof the water and spread them out to a depth not exceeding two or three\r\ninches in some vessel which allows free access of air to them. Keep\r\nthem moist by covering with sacking, which is wetted at intervals. The\r\ngermination should reach the stage necessary within twenty-four hours\r\nin a hot climate, and the pulses should be cooked and eaten as soon as\r\npossible after germination. Care should be taken not to overcook them.\r\nAt a pinch germination may be effected by placing the seeds between wet\r\nblankets, but this is a rough-and-ready method not to be recommended.\r\n\r\nIt is important to attend to oral hygiene, especially the regular use\r\nof the tooth-brush. Vegetables should never be overcooked. In the case\r\nof African native followers Kaffir beer made from germinated grain is\r\nof great value; one pint should be given daily per head. Potatoes and\r\nroot vegetables are useful, and the onion is a valuable food in this\r\nconnexion. Fresh meat is not so effective as either fresh fruit or\r\nvegetables.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—This is chiefly dietetic, and the same foods and substances\r\nas are mentioned under prophylaxis are used also for the cure of scurvy.\r\nIn addition, scurvy patients should be kept in bed, given plenty of\r\nfresh air, and have the affected parts massaged. Tonics and mouth-washes\r\nare indicated, and a liberal diet with plenty of fat in it should be\r\nprovided. Where fresh fruit cannot be obtained raw meat and raw fresh\r\neggs in milk form a good substitute.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sea-Sickness._\r\n\r\nTake a saline aperient on the day before embarking, and a light plain\r\nmeal at least three hours before going on board. A cup of good tea or\r\nblack coffee soon after starting is often of use.\r\n\r\nThose liable to sea-sickness should go to bed directly they get on board:\r\nthe head should be kept low and the room darkened. A mustard leaf applied\r\nto the pit of the stomach is of value in diminishing the tendency to\r\nvomit. An abdominal belt is useful from the gentle support it gives. A\r\nhot-water bottle may be applied to the feet.\r\n\r\nA mixture containing fifteen grains of bromide of soda and five grains of\r\nantipyrine to one ounce of water is often of great value. The first dose\r\nshould be given immediately the patient is in bed, and may be repeated\r\nevery six hours if required.\r\n\r\nWhitla states that the best of all remedies is bromide of ammonium. It\r\nshould be given in twenty-grain doses for a day or two before embarking.\r\nMorphia may be found necessary: a third of a grain may be injected under\r\nthe skin of adults, but it should on no account be given to children.\r\n\r\nI have found that three or four drops of chloroform, dropped on to loaf\r\nsugar and sucked, often prevents vomiting.\r\n\r\nThose who are vomiting severely should take plenty of hot water or milk,\r\nso as to prevent them from straining on an empty stomach.\r\n\r\nVery often raisins or raisin tea can be taken when other nourishment is\r\nrejected. A recent method of treatment which has sometimes been found\r\neffective is to plug the ears firmly with cotton-wool, but this should\r\nonly be done by a medical man. It is, however, worth trying.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Skin Diseases._\r\n\r\n_Boils._—Boils are very common in the tropics and occur especially in\r\npeople who have been run down. They are most frequent during or after\r\nthe rains and especially in the course of hot, damp summers. In Egypt the\r\nso-called Nile boil is quite a feature of the country. In the tropics\r\nboils are often multiple and a very favourite site is the buttocks. Any\r\npart, however, which is apt to be bathed in sweat is liable to infection.\r\nA boil on the face may apparently result from the bite of a mosquito or\r\nother blood-sucking insect.\r\n\r\n_Prophylaxis._—Protect from insect bites and treat even the most trivial\r\nof skin lesions with tincture of iodine. Keep the skin clean and change\r\nthe underclothing frequently. If a boil occurs cover it with a small\r\ndressing so that other parts of the skin may not be affected. A change of\r\nclimate is often the only thing that will do good in the case of a person\r\nafflicted with crops of boils.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—It is sometimes possible to abort a boil by dipping a\r\nsharpened wooden match or a toothpick into pure carbolic acid and\r\nthrusting it repeatedly into the heart of the swelling. If the boil has\r\nsomewhat developed hot fomentations and moist dressings should be applied\r\nand iodine should be painted on the skin round the boil. As a rule it\r\nis wiser not to open a boil, even when it has suppurated. It is best\r\nto let it burst and then to dress it carefully with a boric poultice,\r\nwhich should be frequently changed. Treatment with vaccines has come\r\ninto vogue and is sometimes very helpful. Sulphide of calcium pills, one\r\ngrain in each, three times a day, are often given and are said to have\r\na prophylactic effect, but a preparation known as stannoxyl and used in\r\nthe form of tablets is to be preferred. The usual dose is four tablets\r\nthe first day, six the second, and eight on subsequent days. The drug\r\nis somewhat constipating. A remedy more easily obtained and which is\r\nsaid to be distinctly beneficial is dilute sulphuric acid. It should be\r\ntaken in doses of twenty to thirty drops, well diluted, every four hours.\r\nThe general health requires attention and lemon juice, plenty of green\r\nvegetables and tonics should be taken.\r\n\r\n_Carbuncles._—A carbuncle is of the same nature as a boil, but is a more\r\nserious complaint, and it is distinguished from a boil by the fact that\r\nit opens by several mouths.\r\n\r\nTo promote ripening of the carbuncle and the separation of the core or\r\ndead piece of tissue, poultices and hot fomentations should be freely\r\napplied, and if the core can be seen it should be removed, if possible,\r\nby a pair of forceps.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate removal of the core it is sometimes advisable to cut\r\nthrough the skin separating the openings; there may be some slight\r\nbleeding, but it will cease after a short time.\r\n\r\nOpium may be given to relieve acute suffering. The bowels should be kept\r\nwell open. A generous diet must be given; tonics of iron, quinine and\r\narsenic are needed, and alcohol may prove necessary.\r\n\r\nCarbuncles rarely appear except in people much broken down in health, and\r\ntheir presence is an indication that the sufferer should return to his\r\nown country and seek skilled advice.\r\n\r\n_Chigger._—The chigger is not itself a disease but is a sand-flea\r\nproducing a condition known by the long name of dermatophiliasis. It is\r\na veritable pest in parts of South America and all over tropical Africa.\r\nThe insect is like the common flea but smaller, lives in dry sandy soil\r\nand sucks the blood of mammals, especially pigs. After impregnation the\r\nfemale burrows into the skin of a mammal or bird, and, nourished by\r\nblood, proceeds to ovulation. Her abdomen becomes filled with ripe eggs\r\nand enormously distended till it looks like a small pea. Eventually the\r\neggs escape through the opening of the skin and hatch into larvæ which in\r\ndue time become adult fleas.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._—In man the feet are the part most frequently affected, the\r\nchiggers being found between the toes and under the toe nails. When\r\npeople sleep on the ground other parts of the body may become affected\r\nand large numbers of chiggers may be present at one time. There is\r\nitching and irritation at the place of invasion, and when the latter is\r\nexamined a little dark dot will be seen. This is the posterior end of the\r\nfemale flea, which is lying head downwards in her burrow. If not removed\r\nsuppuration occurs round her distended abdomen and the skin gets much\r\ninflamed and swollen. When the eggs have been discharged ulceration takes\r\nplace and the flea is expelled. A small sore, however, is left which is\r\nvery liable to get contaminated, and, if neglected, may lead to very\r\nsevere complications.\r\n\r\n_Prophylaxis._—Do not camp in the neighbourhood of native villages. Clean\r\nthe camping ground thoroughly and, if necessary, fire it. As insecticides\r\nflaked naphthalene or a strong infusion of native tobacco are useful.\r\nThe latter may be used inside boots or shoes. Walking bare-foot should\r\nbe avoided, as should sleeping unprotected on the ground. In the case\r\nof native carriers or porters a daily foot-parade should be instituted.\r\nSome protection is afforded by smearing the feet, especially the spaces\r\nbetween and under the toes, with a preparation like phenofax or with a\r\nmixture of five drops of lysol or cresol and an ounce of vaseline.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—It is usually better to get a native to remove a chigger\r\nas long practice makes them very expert in the little operation. The\r\nlatter consists in widening the skin orifice with a sharp clean needle,\r\nand freeing the flea from the surrounding tissues in order to get it out\r\nwhole. If it ruptures forceps must be employed, and this is much more\r\npainful and difficult than extracting the entire insect. The infected\r\nparts should be carefully treated antiseptically.\r\n\r\n_Fungus Diseases._—There is a great number of tropical diseases due to\r\nfungi but only a few can be considered here, and these only very briefly.\r\n(1) _Dhobie Itch_ is one of the best known and is so called because it\r\nwas thought to be derived from clothes infected by the persons (dhobies)\r\nwho washed them. The parts usually attacked are the groins, the upper\r\npart of the thighs and the armpits. The condition is due to a fungus like\r\nthat of ringworm and the skin becomes red and raised and somewhat scurfy.\r\nDhobie itch causes great irritation and is sometimes associated with\r\nconsiderable pain.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Mild cases are best treated by using an ointment containing\r\nresorcin two drachms, salicylic acid ten grains, and vaseline and\r\nlanoline, of each four drachms. The parts may be painted with iodine but\r\nthis is somewhat irritating. An ointment of ammoniated mercury, two to\r\nfive per cent., is often effective. Bad cases require the application\r\nof araroba (chrysarobin) ointment, but it should not be used unless\r\nrecommended by a doctor. Goulard water or Wright’s liquor carbonis\r\ndetergens (one tablespoonful to two pints of water) are soothing\r\napplications.\r\n\r\n(2) There is a fungus disease of the hairs, especially of the armpits\r\nand the pubis, which occurs in tropical climates and is often very\r\ntroublesome. The hairs assume a coated, beaded or nodular appearance and\r\nthe deposit on them varies in colour and may be black, yellow or red.\r\nThe underclothing in contact with the affected parts becomes stained\r\nand when the disease spreads to the skin, as it often does, the latter\r\nbecomes inflamed, thickened and painful.\r\n\r\n_Prophylaxis._—Keep the axillae shaved. It is always well to do so in a\r\ntropical climate. Failing this, dust with a mixture of powdered sulphur\r\nand fuller’s earth, equal parts. Change the underclothing frequently and\r\nbathe the parts liable to infection.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Apply twice daily a lotion containing one drachm of formalin\r\nin six ounces of rectified spirit, and at night rub in a two per cent.\r\nsulphur ointment. If these measures fail apply tincture of iodine, except\r\nin cases where the skin is involved. In such cases bathe with cold water\r\nand employ a dusting powder or a soothing lotion.\r\n\r\n(3) _Ringworm_ of the head is a disease due to a fungus. The part for\r\nsome distance round the affected area should be shaved, and any stumps\r\nof hairs pulled out. The skin should be lightly painted with tincture\r\nof iodine or strong solution of carbolic acid (one in ten of water); or\r\nsulphur, white precipitate, or mercurial ointment may be gently rubbed in.\r\n\r\n_Kraw-Kraw._—This is a term commonly employed by natives of the West\r\nCoast of Africa to indicate almost any kind of itchy, papular, or\r\npustular eruption. Many of these appear to be contagious, and most of\r\nthem are best treated by opening up any pustules which may be present,\r\nremoving crusts by boric poultices, and scraping ulcers. Then scrub\r\nthoroughly with sublimate lotion 1 in 1,000, dust with boric powder and\r\napply a dressing of medicated vaseline. The application should not be\r\ndisturbed for a week when, as a rule, the skin will be found to have\r\nhealed up. Clothing and any other articles which have been in contact\r\nwith the affected parts should be destroyed or thoroughly disinfected.\r\n\r\n_Prickly Heat._—This condition is very frequent, especially in the moist\r\ntropics. It is due to free sweating, and is accompanied by intense heat\r\nand itching. The parts closely covered by clothing are specially apt to\r\nbe affected. The skin becomes covered with numerous slightly inflamed\r\npapules, set close together, and the eruption may remain for months at a\r\ntime, varying in intensity according to circumstances.\r\n\r\n_Prophylaxis._—Avoid long drinks, warm clothing, too much exercise, and\r\nall conditions producing excessive perspiration. Sea-bathing should\r\nbe avoided, and soap should not be used in the bath. One should sleep\r\nunder as hygienic conditions as possible, with a well-ventilated bed and\r\nwithout unnecessary clothing. A dusting powder of equal parts of boric\r\nacid, oxide of zinc, and starch is useful.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Ryan strongly recommends the so-called “Sulphaqua” bath\r\ncharge, which is sold in packets ready for use. The above-mentioned\r\ndusting powder is helpful, as is the application of a lotion containing\r\nsalicylic acid and spirit. Some prefer oily applications. Whatever is\r\nused, care should be taken to see that the bowels are well opened at the\r\nbeginning of an attack, preferably by a saline purge.\r\n\r\n_Ulcers._—Ulcers are often very troublesome to the traveller, as the\r\nhealing process is frequently retarded by exposure, dirt and dust, and\r\nthe chafing of clothes. Want of sufficient animal food greatly favours\r\nthe spread of large ulcers.\r\n\r\nA simple dressing of iodoform ointment, or ointment of boric acid, is\r\neffective when the ulcer can be protected, and rest can be given to the\r\naffected part. When the ulcer is deep and large it may be stimulated to\r\nheal by the application of lint or cotton-wool, moistened with carbolic\r\noil, carbolic lotion, or other antiseptics.\r\n\r\nLarge, unhealthy ulcers should be well bathed with some antiseptic such\r\nas carbolic acid, one in sixty of water, or a solution of chinosol (1 in\r\n600); and after the sore has been cleansed it may be lightly dusted with\r\niodoform and then covered with a piece of lint moistened with carbolic\r\noil or smeared with iodoform ointment and supported by an evenly applied\r\nbandage. Boric ointment, lano-creoline, izal ointment or other antiseptic\r\ndressing may take the place of iodoform ointment.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above general account, certain conditions leading to\r\nulceration require consideration.\r\n\r\n_Oriental Sore._—This condition is commonly known as Baghdad Boil, Aleppo\r\nButton, Frontier Sore, etc. It occurs in various hot countries, such\r\nas Egypt, Syria, Asia Minor, Arabia, and Mesopotamia, and has been met\r\nwith in Europe and Greece. A special form affecting both skin and mucous\r\nmembranes is widely distributed in South America.\r\n\r\n_Cause._—The cause is an organism to all appearance identical with that\r\nwhich produces leishmaniasis or kala-azar. Indeed, Oriental sore is a\r\nform of cutaneous leishmaniasis. In all probability infection is conveyed\r\nby sand-flies, but our knowledge is still defective on this point.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._—The incubation period varies from a fortnight to a year. The\r\nsore may occur on any exposed part of the body, but is most common on the\r\nforearm, hands, and face. Multiple sores are frequent. The first sign is\r\na small red, scaly papule, which increases in size and eventually breaks\r\ndown, forming a painless ulcer, with a hard, dry edge. Non-ulcerating\r\nforms occur, but are not common. The condition is very chronic, but\r\nhealing usually sets in after six to twelve months. When the ulcer heals\r\na white or pink scar is left, which is disfiguring.\r\n\r\n_Prophylaxis._—Sleep under a sand-fly net, containing 22 holes to the\r\nlinear inch. Warn against the danger of infection by personal contact and\r\nthe risk of re-infecting oneself by scratching. It is advisable to paint\r\nthe sites of all fly and insect bites with iodine as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—The best treatment at present known is intravenous injection\r\nof tartar emetic. This, of course, can be carried out only by a medical\r\nman. Good results have, however, been obtained by applying a 2 per cent.\r\nointment of tartarate of antimony, and this method can be carried out by\r\nthe patient himself. Local injections of emetine have been recommended,\r\nand there are various other ways of treating Oriental sore, but they need\r\nnot be here considered.\r\n\r\n_Tropical Ulcer._—This is a special and serious form of ulcer found in\r\nall parts of the world, and especially amongst East African natives. It\r\nis found chiefly in the lower third of the leg and in the region of the\r\nfoot and ankle.\r\n\r\n_Cause._—This is somewhat obscure, but it is believed to be due to\r\ncertain organisms possibly acting in association with one another.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._—The condition starts as a small, tender, and often itchy\r\npapular bleb, surrounded by a dense inflammatory zone. An ulcer results,\r\nwhich is more or less painless, and one of the characteristics of which\r\nis the way it spreads and destroys all the tissues with which it comes\r\nin contact. It is often mistaken for a syphilitic ulcer, but it does not\r\nusually yield to anti-syphilitic remedies.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—The best remedy would appear to be formalin, though the\r\niodoform ointment mentioned under ulcers may aid the condition. It can be\r\neffectually treated only by a medical man.\r\n\r\n_Veldt Sore._—This condition, which is also known as Barcoo Rot, is\r\nfrequently in evidence in countries with hot, dry climates, as, for\r\nexample, Egypt, Palestine, South Africa, Mesopotamia, etc.\r\n\r\n_Cause._—It is due to certain bacteriological organisms, and is apt to\r\noccur in persons who are debilitated, who are not receiving proper food,\r\nor who are living under conditions where it is not easy to keep clean.\r\nSome think the sores are commonest in men who have to deal with horses.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._—Veldt sores are most common on the hands and forearms. They\r\nbegin as itchy papules, which become blebs, then pustules, and finally\r\nulcers. They are usually multiple, and when they heal they leave areas of\r\nthin, glossy skin.\r\n\r\n_Prophylaxis._—As for boils.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—The spread of ulcers can be checked by removing the hairs\r\nfrom their bases and round their margins. Very often the ulcer can\r\nbe started on its healing process by employing dressings soaked in a\r\nsolution of 1.5 per cent. sodium citrate and 20 per cent. common salt.\r\nVaccines are often successfully used in this condition, and the stannoxyl\r\nmentioned under boils may be employed, as may a salicylic acid ointment,\r\n20 grains to the ounce.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sleeping Sickness._\r\n\r\nThis is the old “Negro lethargy,” and must not be confounded with what is\r\nnow called sleeping sickness in the British Isles and on the Continent,\r\nwhich is quite a different disease. True sleeping sickness is limited to\r\nAfrica, and there are two chief types: that occurring in parts of the\r\nWest Coast and the French and Belgian Congos, in Angola, in portions\r\nof the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, in Uganda, and in parts of the Tanganyika\r\nterritory; and that which occurs in Northern Rhodesia, Nyasaland,\r\nPortuguese West Africa, and the region of the Rovuma River.\r\n\r\n_Cause._—The cause is a tiny animal blood parasite conveyed from the sick\r\nto the healthy by certain species of tsetse flies. In the tsetse fly the\r\nparasite, which is called a trypanosome, undergoes a definite development.\r\n\r\nThe two species of tsetse fly meriting special consideration here are\r\n_Glossina morsitans_ and _Glossina palpalis_. The former, as a rule,\r\noccurs in thin, deciduous bush, or low, comparatively open forest, while\r\nthe latter haunts the neighbourhood of streams and lakes, and is rarely\r\nfound any great distance from the water edge. These flies are about the\r\nsize of a small blue-bottle, but are not so stoutly built and, when\r\nclosed, their wings overlap and project beyond the end of the abdomen.\r\n_Glossina morsitans_ is brownish coloured, with bands on its abdomen.\r\n_Glossina palpalis_ is much darker, indeed almost black-looking. They\r\nhave a quick and darting flight, and are attracted by rapidly-moving\r\nobjects, like motor-bicycles and motor-cars. Once they alight they do not\r\nmove about. As a rule they bite only during the day, but they may attack\r\nman on bright moonlight nights.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._—The incubation period is probably about three weeks. The\r\nfly bite may be painful; and causes a slight local irritation. The\r\ndisease begins insidiously, with an irregular fever, and there may be\r\na skin eruption. The fever comes and goes, and the patient gets weaker\r\nand suffers from headache. The glands in his neck and possibly in other\r\nparts of his body become enlarged and may be tender. The first stage\r\nof the disease is called trypanosome fever, and may end in recovery.\r\nMore usually the central nervous system becomes affected, and then the\r\nsymptoms of true sleeping sickness develop, slowly or with considerable\r\nrapidity. The patient becomes dull and drowsy. Both his speech and\r\nmovements are affected. His face gets puffy, and he shuffles when he\r\nwalks. He still has fever, continues to lose flesh, and gradually passes\r\ninto a sleepy condition, which may be associated with convulsions. Saliva\r\ndribbles from the lips, and half-masticated food may remain in the\r\nmouth. The patient becomes helpless and indifferent to his surroundings,\r\nand either dies from coma or from some intercurrent disease, such as\r\npneumonia or dysentery.\r\n\r\n_Prophylaxis._—Personal prophylaxis consists in avoiding being bitten by\r\ntsetse flies. When passing through fly belts in affected areas veils and\r\ngloves may be worn.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—If taken in time sleeping sickness can be readily cured by\r\nthe use of the arsenical preparation atoxyl, combined with antimony. The\r\ncourse of treatment, however, extends over a considerable period, and it\r\nmust be carried out under the supervision of a medical man.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sleeplessness._\r\n\r\nThis is common in those broken down by malaria, dysentery or debilitating\r\ndiseases; it is also induced by the irritation caused by mosquitoes and\r\nother pests, such as the itch parasite. It is at times due to errors of\r\ndiet, prickly heat, mental worry and exhaustion, abuse of tea and coffee,\r\ncoldness of the feet and indigestion, and as most acute diseases are\r\nworse at night, sleeplessness is very common amongst sick people.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—As far as possible remove the cause; kneading the feet and\r\nlegs, or the application of a hot-water bottle to the feet, will often\r\nbe of service. A cup of hot milk or soup should be taken at bedtime, and\r\nagain on waking in the night. The bowels must be regulated and alcohol\r\ntaken very sparingly.\r\n\r\nThe taking of sedative drugs should be avoided as much as possible. The\r\nleast harmful of these is sulphonal in doses of from twenty to thirty\r\ngrains, given several hours before bedtime, or bromide of potassium in\r\ntwenty or thirty-grain doses given at bedtime. A warm bath at night often\r\nacts more satisfactorily than any other remedy. Only very rarely should\r\nchloral, chlorodyne, or opium be resorted to.\r\n\r\nRegular habits and plenty of work are potent factors in the production of\r\nthat healthy condition which predisposes to natural refreshing sleep.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate man who has no hard work to do, who is without even a\r\nhobby to occupy him, and has no interest in life but the torpid condition\r\nof his liver, is a constant sufferer from insomnia. He should be purged\r\nand put on a light plain diet. Alcohol must be forbidden and plenty of\r\nexercise must be taken. A tumblerful of hot water is to be taken the\r\nfirst thing in the morning and the last thing at night.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Small-pox._\r\n\r\nVery prevalent in the tropics, hence the importance of revaccination\r\nbefore going abroad.\r\n\r\nIncubation period, twelve days. Rash appears third day.\r\n\r\n_Rash._—Before the appearance of the typical rash there are occasionally\r\nearlier rashes, viz., a diffuse blush covering the whole body, resembling\r\nscarlet fever, or a dark purple rash of effused blood beneath the skin of\r\nthe lower part of the belly, or occasionally in the armpit. The small-pox\r\nrash proper consists of small red raised spots which first appear on\r\nthe face, forehead, and scalp, subsequently coming out over the rest\r\nof the body, commencing at the top and working downwards. These spots\r\nbecome prominent, and have a characteristic “shotty” feeling under the\r\nfinger. On the third day after their appearance a small bleb forms in\r\nthe centre of each spot; it is transparent at first, but subsequently\r\nbecomes yellowish, from the formation of matter in its interior. The\r\ncentre becomes depressed on the sixth day, then the bleb breaks down,\r\nand discharges matter. Two or three days later the spot begins to dry\r\nup, and ultimately heals under a scab. During the period of most active\r\ninflammation the face may be very swollen and sodden.\r\n\r\nThe spots and pustules are not confined to the skin, but may occur on the\r\nroof of the mouth and in the throat.\r\n\r\n_Prophylaxis._—This consists in efficient vaccination, and as travellers\r\nmay themselves have to carry out the technique of vaccination, it is\r\nimportant they should know something about it. The usual faults in\r\ntechnique are a lack of cleanliness, resulting in sepsis, the use of\r\ntoo strong an antiseptic when cleaning the skin, over-heating of the\r\nlancet, needle or scarifier when purifying it, drawing too much blood,\r\nwhich washes away the lymph, exposure of the recently vaccinated area\r\nto the hot sun, and charring of the lymph in the capillary tube when\r\nsealing. All that is necessary is to clean the part to be vaccinated with\r\nsoap and water, using a nail-brush, then rub the skin with alcohol, and\r\nwhen the latter dries proceed with the little operation. There should\r\nbe four incisions, and the total area which will eventually be occupied\r\nby the vaccine vesicles should not be less than half a square inch. It\r\nmay be noted that the vesicle is fully ripe on the seventh day after\r\nvaccination.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Isolation, similar to that of scarlet fever. The body may be\r\nsponged and vaseline applied if there is much itching. The eyelids and\r\neyes should be frequently washed with weak boric acid solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Snake Bite_ (_see_ p. 281).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sprue._\r\n\r\nThis is a chronic form of tropical diarrhœa, often called “white\r\ndiarrhœa,” the leading symptom of which is the frequent passage of large,\r\nfrothy, and pale-coloured motions; dyspepsia, and soreness of the tongue\r\nand mouth, are also present, and there is marked anæmia and advancing\r\ndebility. The disease may follow attacks of diarrhœa or dysentery.\r\n\r\n_Cause._—The actual cause of sprue is unknown, but the disease usually\r\ndevelops in persons who have been for some considerable time in the\r\ntropics, and it is commoner in India, Ceylon, and the Far East than\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Put the patient to bed, give a simple aperient such as\r\ncastor-oil, to clear out the bowels; allow only a milk diet, to which, as\r\nthe symptoms begin to abate, meat juices and jellies should be cautiously\r\nadded. If any other disease, such as scurvy, is present, it must be\r\ntreated. Drugs are not usually of much service; however, a mixture\r\ncontaining bismuth, soda, and one drop of carbolic acid in an ounce of\r\ngum-water may be given three times a day for a week. The soreness of\r\nthe mouth and tongue may be treated by the application of borax and\r\nglycerine, or mild antiseptic mouth washes, such as a weak solution of\r\npermanganate of potash, or a lotion of boric acid. Special symptoms,\r\nsuch as pain and collapse, must be treated as they arise. As soon as the\r\npatient is strong enough, he should be removed to a temperate climate.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Stroke, or Apoplexy._\r\n\r\nThis disease is caused by the rupture or blocking up of one of the\r\nblood-vessels in the brain.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._—The person attacked falls down suddenly, and is unable to\r\nmove one or more of his limbs. He may be quite insensible, or soon become\r\nso, or perhaps he is unable to talk. The mouth may be drawn to one side,\r\nand the tongue, when protruded, be pushed to the right or left. The\r\ncondition is serious.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Tight clothing must be removed. Six grains of calomel powder\r\nshould be placed on the back of the tongue, and the patient kept lying\r\non his back with the head slightly raised. Cold should be applied to the\r\nhead and a hot-water bottle to the feet, the room darkened, and absolute\r\nquiet observed. An enema of hot water may be given, and while the patient\r\nis insensible the lips should be moistened only with water. Food may be\r\ngiven by the bowel on the second or third day. Stimulants are absolutely\r\nforbidden. If the patient gets over the attack he ought to be sent home.\r\n\r\n_Note._—It must not be forgotten that many of the above symptoms might be\r\ncaused by injury or poison.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sun-Stroke and Heat-Stroke._\r\n\r\nThese conditions are distinct. Sun-stroke, which is comparatively rare,\r\nis due to the direct action of the sun on the brain and spinal cord.\r\nHeat-stroke, on the other hand, would appear to be due to the lack of\r\nescape of heat from the body, owing to insufficient evaporation from\r\nthe skin, and to the effect of muscular fatigue. As a result, poisonous\r\nsubstances accumulate and act detrimentally upon the nerve cells. There\r\nis also a deficient supply of oxygen to the blood. High relative humidity\r\nplays a very important part in producing attacks of heat-stroke. The\r\nmilder forms are known as Heat exhaustion and Heat prostration; the\r\nsevere form is often associated with true sun-stroke.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._—Heat exhaustion is really a form of faintness, and recovery\r\nsoon takes place after a rest. The symptoms of heat prostration are\r\ngiddiness, often associated with nausea. The patient is bathed in a\r\nclammy sweat, his pulse is thready, his breathing shallow, and, it\r\nmay be, sighing. The condition may pass into unconsciousness, but the\r\ntemperature is not raised, and death rarely results.\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of true Heat-stroke; one a form with high\r\ntemperature, the other what is called Heat cramp, which is common amongst\r\nships’ firemen in the tropics. An early warning sign of heat-stroke is\r\na desire for frequent micturition, and other premonitory symptoms are\r\na dry skin, giddiness, drowsiness, headache, and intolerance of light.\r\nThe pulse becomes quick and irregular, the skin is hot and dry, and\r\nthe temperature elevated. The patient may become comatose, or exhibit\r\ndelirium or convulsions. There is an asphyxial type, in which the face\r\nbecomes cyanosed and the breathing is in abeyance.\r\n\r\n_Prophylaxis._—Avoid severe exercise in a hot sun. Wear suitable\r\nclothing, which should be loose and easy, and protect the head, and\r\nespecially the nape of the neck, from the sun’s rays. Dark or tinted\r\nglasses are useful. Water should be taken freely, and the bowels kept\r\nopen; but alcohol must be avoided. Sniffing a mixture of water and\r\nvinegar and damping the face are helpful measures.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—In the case of Heat prostration the patient should be laid\r\nin the shade on his back, his clothes should be loosened, his limbs\r\nmassaged, and, if he is collapsed, stimulants in the form of ammonia\r\nor camphor should be administered. The asphyxial type of heat-stroke\r\ncan only be treated by means of artificial respiration, which may have\r\nto be continued for as long as a couple of hours. The ordinary form,\r\nwhich has been called the paralytic type, must be treated promptly and\r\nvigorously. One must aim at reducing the temperature, getting rid of the\r\ntoxic material in the body and preventing heart failure. Probably the\r\nbest way of treating the condition as an emergency is to lay the patient\r\nnaked on an inclined plane and drench him with cold water. When doing\r\nso it is well to take the rectal temperature, and to stop this chilling\r\nprocess when the thermometer registers 102° F. After the drenching wrap\r\nthe patient in blankets and apply hot bottles to the trunk and limbs. An\r\nice bag, if available, should be applied to the head, which in any case\r\nshould be swathed in cold cloths. It should be noted that in the absence\r\nof ice, a sheet soaked in cold water or dilute alcohol, over which a\r\ndraught of air plays, is a useful substitute. A fan may be used to create\r\nthe air draught. Auxiliary methods of treatment can be efficiently\r\ncarried out only under medical supervision. As soon as the patient has\r\nrecovered somewhat, a dose of calomel should be given, followed by\r\nsalines.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Syphilis._\r\n\r\nSyphilis, or the Pox, is an infectious venereal disease, nearly always\r\ncommunicated by direct contagion. The course of the disease is marked by\r\na primary sore, the chancre; early constitutional (secondary) symptoms,\r\nand late constitutional (tertiary) symptoms.\r\n\r\nIn primary syphilis the disease is limited to the part or organ\r\noriginally infected, and the glands connected with that spot. After an\r\nincubation period of from three to six weeks a small painless pimple\r\nappears at the seat of infection; it breaks down, and forms a small ulcer\r\nfrom which oozes a little watery fluid. The base of the ulcer and the\r\nskin surrounding it are hard like gristle. The nearest glands, usually\r\nthose of the groin, enlarge and occasionally become tender. Unless badly\r\nneglected, the original sore gradually heals and the glands resume their\r\nnormal size. Secondary symptoms now make their appearance. These are\r\nfairly definite, and comprises (_a_) A skin rash, consisting of numerous\r\nirregularly shaped copper-coloured spots, spread over the face, upper\r\npart of the chest, the loins and the back of the arms. They do not itch.\r\n(_b_) Moist lumps and warts form in the crutch, around the scrotum\r\n(purse) and the outlet of the bowel. (_c_) Ulcerated sore throat. Large\r\ndeep ulcers form on each tonsil, having ragged undermined edges. (_d_)\r\nIritis or inflammation of the eye may also occur. These symptoms, even\r\nif untreated, tend to heal, but always leave more or less marked traces\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\nThe discharge from either primary or secondary sores is infectious and\r\nmay convey the disease, so that great care needs to be taken in handling\r\nsuch sores.\r\n\r\nAfter an interval of apparent health, lasting perhaps only a few months,\r\nbut often for a year or two, the tertiary symptoms or “reminders” make\r\ntheir appearance. These take the form of localised swellings, which soon\r\nbreak down, forming deep ulcers, and if untreated, produce extensive\r\ndestruction of the part involved, with much deformity.\r\n\r\n_Prophylaxis._—The methods available are now so well known that they\r\nneed not be discussed in a work of this kind. Mention need merely be\r\nmade of the fact that in some foreign countries, owing to unhygienic\r\nconditions, there is a greater liability to contract the disease by what\r\nmay be called unusual methods, and therefore every care should be taken\r\nto prevent such sources of infection, as, for example, the contaminated\r\nseats of closets, etc.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—As soon as the disease is recognised, the treatment must be\r\ncommenced.\r\n\r\nLocal treatment.—Keep the sore perfectly clean by washing it with an\r\nantiseptic solution such as chinosol (1 in 1000). Between the washings,\r\ndress it with a piece of lint soaked in “black wash,” or dust it with\r\niodoform powder and cover it with a piece of lint smeared with boric\r\nointment.\r\n\r\nFor the sore throat, use an antiseptic gargle (_see_ Ulceration of\r\nThroat, p. 244).\r\n\r\nGeneral treatment.—The patient must be put on a course of mercury at\r\nonce. Calomel, one grain twice a day, or grey powder, one grain three\r\ntimes a day, must be administered, and continued until skilled advice\r\ncan be obtained. The effect of the mercury must be carefully watched,\r\nand if the patient complains of soreness of the gums, a coppery taste in\r\nthe mouth and excessive flow of saliva, the dose must be reduced or the\r\nadministration of the drug stopped until these symptoms have disappeared.\r\nIf the calomel or grey powder causes looseness of the bowels, five grains\r\nof Dover’s powder may be added to each dose.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, the addition of three grains of the iodide of potash to\r\neach grain of calomel does good from the very first.\r\n\r\nFor the later symptoms, continue the mercurial treatment, and give at\r\nleast five grains of the iodide of potassium three times a day.\r\n\r\nSince the above was written the whole treatment of syphilis has been\r\nrevolutionized by the introduction of certain organic arsenic compounds\r\nas therapeutic agents. Of these the best known is the German salvarsan,\r\nrepresented in this country by kharsivan, the so-called “606.” Treatment\r\nwith arsenic has now largely replaced the old method with mercury; but it\r\ncannot be carried out except by one having medical training, and so need\r\nnot be further considered.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tick Fever._\r\n\r\nOne of the diseases which may be produced by the bites of insects is a\r\nform of fever, conveyed by the bite of a tick, which is common in many\r\nparts of Africa. This produces a series of symptoms which are similar to\r\nthose found in the disease known as relapsing fever, which has been known\r\nto occur even in the United Kingdom, and which used to be called “famine\r\nfever” (_see_ p. 218).\r\n\r\n_Cause._—The cause is a corkscrew-shaped organism found in the blood,\r\nand its vector is the tick above mentioned, which in its adult state and\r\nunfed is roughly about the length of a finger-nail, that is, four-tenths\r\nof an inch. It is of a greenish brown colour, and is covered by a\r\nleathery integument, which looks as if it was spotted all over and which\r\nis grooved in several places. When the tick is gorged, these grooves\r\ndisappear. A gorged female tick may be well over half an inch in length,\r\nand very nearly of an equal breadth.\r\n\r\nThe tick lives in native houses and in rest houses, especially along\r\ncaravan routes. At night it sallies forth in search of blood, but during\r\nthe day it conceals itself in cracks and corners in the walls and floors,\r\nand sometimes in cracks in native wooden bedsteads. Its bite is painful,\r\nbut the infection takes place not through the bite, but as a result of\r\nthe infected excreta of the tick contaminating the tick bite. One tick is\r\nsufficient to cause infection.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._—The chief symptoms are those of a severe attack of fever,\r\nushered in by a shivering fit and acute symptoms such as are usually\r\nfound in cases of fever, for example, pains in the back and limbs, rapid\r\npulse, and sometimes severe vomiting and diarrhœa, frontal headache, and\r\npainful bloodshot eyes are rather characteristic. The fever, which is\r\nof the relapsing type, generally keeps up for about a week, after which\r\nthere may be an interval without fever for a few days, to be followed\r\nlater on by another attack of fever. There are usually several relapses.\r\nAs many as eleven have been noted.\r\n\r\n_Prophylaxis._—Avoid sleeping in native huts and rest houses which have\r\nbeen occupied by natives. Do not sleep on the ground or on wooden native\r\nbedsteads. If the latter have to be used, their legs should be smoothed\r\nto prevent ticks from climbing up them. In badly infested places, it is\r\nwell to employ a hammock. A mosquito-net is useful, as it excludes the\r\nticks; and it is well to make use of a night-light, which also keeps\r\nthem away. Packs and blankets should be periodically inspected to see\r\nthat they do not harbour ticks. If one has to camp on an infected area,\r\nthe ground should be fired and the floors of huts dug up and thereafter\r\nremoved and buried or treated with fire, care being taken that the ticks\r\ndo not escape during the process. Wandering ticks can be kept away from a\r\ntent to some extent by digging round it a trench and filling it with wood\r\nashes.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—This is mainly symptomatic. Careful nursing is required\r\ntogether with a light diet. In some cases the arsenic preparation known\r\nas salvarsan (kharsivan) is found of value, but the specific treatment\r\nof this malady can only be carried out by a medical man. In many cases\r\ndigitalis or strophanthus is required, owing to the risk of heart failure.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Typhus Fever._\r\n\r\nThis disease is not so common in the tropics, but in certain sub-tropical\r\ncountries, such as Egypt, it frequently occurs, and it is of course\r\nclosely associated with military operations in the field.\r\n\r\n_Cause._—The exact nature of the infection is as yet unknown, but the\r\ndisease is transmitted by lice, both the head and the body louse having\r\nbeen proved to be carriers of the virus.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._—Incubation period 5 to 14 days, as a rule 12 days. Symptoms\r\nvary, but at first somewhat resemble those of an influenzal attack\r\nwithout the cold in the head. The patient is feverish and uncomfortable,\r\nbut not until the third day do the typical symptoms of typhus make\r\ntheir appearance. Then the patient’s face becomes flushed and his eyes\r\ncongested, his pulse rate increases, and very soon his temperature rises\r\nand runs up to 103 or 104° F. The rash, which varies in type, generally\r\nappears on the fifth day, being found first on the upper part of the\r\nabdomen. It does not occur upon the face, but is usually very profuse on\r\nthe back. If the rash develops the patient becomes seriously ill, and all\r\nhis symptoms are intensified. He becomes dull and lethargic, his mouth is\r\nfoul, and his general aspect is somewhat like that of a drunken man. His\r\nvoice becomes husky, his hands are tremulous, and his breathing is rapid.\r\nIn the second week, in most cases, he becomes delirious or comatose, and\r\nlies in bed more or less like a log. In cases that recover, improvement\r\nsets in about the fourteenth day, and is usually rapid and complete.\r\nIn cases which die the temperature remains high or rises, the general\r\ncondition becomes worse, and death usually takes place from heart failure.\r\n\r\n_Prophylaxis._—Get rid of lice according to the methods detailed on\r\npage 196. Those attending typhus patients should be protected from lice\r\nby wearing overalls, etc. Patients suffering from typhus should be\r\nthoroughly cleansed, their hair cut or shaved, and completely cleared of\r\nlice. Bedding and clothing must be disinfected.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Good nursing is of more importance in this disease than the\r\nadministration of drugs. The mouth must be kept in a good condition,\r\nand the food must be strengthening, nourishing soups being indicated.\r\nIt is important to give the patient as much fresh air as possible, and\r\nas a rule he will require stimulants, especially heart tonics such as\r\ndigitalis or strophanthus. Other measures can be carried out only under\r\nmedical supervision.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ulceration of the Throat._\r\n\r\nGargle with a weak antiseptic solution such as permanganate of potash or\r\nchinosol. An astringent gargle may be made by dissolving five grains or\r\nmore of tannin in two ounces of hot water. Sulphate of iron can be used\r\nfor the same purpose, two grains or more to an ounce of water. If there\r\nis much pain, apply poultices to throat.\r\n\r\nIf due to syphilis give one grain of calomel and three grains of iodide\r\nof potassium, twice a day, in addition to the local treatment. Kharsivan,\r\nor similar treatment, is also indicated (_see_ p. 240).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Undulant (Malta) Fever._\r\n\r\nThe term Undulant Fever is applied to Malta Fever partly because the\r\nlatter is not a good name, as the disease occurs in various parts of the\r\nworld, and partly because the term Undulant affords a good description of\r\nthe type of the temperature curve.\r\n\r\n_Cause._—The organism is a small bacterium, which is found in the blood\r\nand tissues. Although theoretically the disease can be spread like\r\nenteric fever or dysentery, in practice it is found that it is nearly\r\nalways conveyed by infected goats’ milk. Goats are apt to harbour the\r\norganism and excrete it in their milk. It is also found in certain milk\r\nproducts, such as cream and cheeses which are not allowed to ripen. In\r\naddition to man and goats, cows, sheep, horses, mules and dogs, are all\r\nliable to natural infection.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._—Incubation period 5 to 15 days. The disease begins with\r\nheadache, malaise, anorexia, and sleeplessness. The patient is usually\r\nconstipated, and there is tenderness in the splenic region, the spleen\r\nbeing enlarged at an early date. The temperature rises gradually for\r\nthree or four days in a step-like manner, and then falls by a similar\r\ndescent, reaching the normal on or about the tenth day. At this early\r\nstage bleeding from the nose may occur, and profuse night sweats are not\r\nuncommon. The tongue is flabby and coated. When the temperature falls\r\nthe patient feels better for a few days, but is still apt to suffer\r\nfrom night sweats, and continues to lose flesh. A relapse occurs, and\r\nis usually accompanied by joint troubles and sometimes neuralgic pains.\r\nA series of febrile waves continues to follow each other at short\r\nintervals, and the illness is a very wearisome one, running an average\r\ncourse of 60 to 70 days. It may, however, extend for nearly a year,\r\nand in some cases terminates fatally. The long course of the illness\r\nresults in the patient becoming anæmic, and he often suffers from mental\r\ndepression. There are irregular forms of the fever which are apt to be\r\npuzzling, and it is always well to remember that any cases of prolonged\r\npyrexia from tropical or sub-tropical regions may be Malta fever.\r\n\r\n_Prophylaxis._—Avoid drinking goats’ milk and eating the local products\r\nof such milk. If goats’ milk must be drunk it should be boiled. General\r\nhygienic measures are also important, and it should not be forgotten that\r\nthe organism of the disease is found in urine, which should therefore be\r\ndisinfected.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—This is for the most part entirely symptomatic. Medical\r\nattention and good nursing are essential. A vaccine has been introduced\r\nand is worth trying, but vaccine treatment is best left to an expert.\r\nIt is sometimes necessary to give morphia for the joint pains and the\r\nneuralgia, but there is a distinct risk of the patient’s acquiring the\r\nmorphia habit. Sleeplessness, which is often troublesome, should be\r\ntreated as indicated on page 235.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Urine, Retention of._\r\n\r\nRetention of, or inability to pass the water may be caused by stricture,\r\ninjury, shock, spasm, inflammation of some part of the passage, the\r\neffects of drinking, or by chill.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._—The bladder is unable to expel its contents and it gets\r\nfuller and fuller; it can be felt in its distended condition as a\r\npainful, soft swelling in the lower part of the belly, below the navel,\r\nunderneath the skin and muscles. There may be fever, great pain and\r\nconstant desire to pass water, with inability to do so. When the bladder\r\nbecomes greatly distended, there is usually slight dribbling of water,\r\nwhich is somewhat misleading, as the case may be considered, not one of\r\nretention but rather of too frequent passing of urine.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Give a saline purge such as Epsom salts, three or four\r\nteaspoonfuls, and let the patient sit in a bath of hot water. If not\r\nrelieved very quickly, then pass a _clean_ catheter into the bladder, and\r\nallow it to empty itself (_see_ Catheters, p. 272). After the bladder has\r\nbeen emptied put the patient to bed and give a dose of opium or bromide\r\nof potassium to procure rest. When he desires to pass water again let him\r\nhave another bath, and if this is not effectual, again withdraw the water\r\nthrough a catheter. Patient should be careful to ward off further attacks\r\nby avoiding chills, over-drinking, and other exciting causes. If there is\r\ninflammation of the bladder, copaiba or sandal-wood capsules should be\r\nused; if the urine is irritating, bicarbonate of soda must be given.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Urine, Suppression of._\r\n\r\nIn this serious condition no urine is secreted by the kidneys, so that on\r\npassing a catheter the bladder will be found to be empty.\r\n\r\n_Causes._—Shock from injury, inflammation and blocking up of the kidneys.\r\nSuppression of the urine is a common complication of severe cases of\r\nblackwater fever.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Hot baths, hot poultices to the loins, free use of\r\naperients, especially Epsom salts and other saline purges. Bicarbonate of\r\nsoda in full doses. Keep the skin acting freely by means of sweet nitre,\r\nor Warburg’s tincture, or five-grain doses of antipyrine. Injections of\r\nhot water into the lower bowel.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Worms._\r\n\r\nWorms are introduced into the system chiefly by means of dirty water or\r\nimperfectly cooked food.\r\n\r\nIn the case of hook worms (ankylostomes), contaminated soil is the chief\r\nmedium of infection.\r\n\r\nOf the worms which live in the bowels the most important are the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n_Tape Worms._—These worms may measure many feet in length; and their\r\npresence in the body can only be certainly known by the appearance of\r\nsome of the segments or portions of the worm in the motions although\r\nhunger and dyspepsia may be complained of.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Administer a good aperient overnight so as to empty the\r\nbowels; after the aperient nothing should be given by the mouth for eight\r\nhours, then give sixty to one hundred and twenty drops of the liquid\r\nextract of male fern in one ounce of thin gruel, milk, or gum water, and\r\nfollow this up in four hours by a good meal, and an aperient to remove\r\nthe worm, which should now be dead.\r\n\r\nWhen the extract of male fern is not available, one tablespoonful of the\r\noil of turpentine may be used in its place.\r\n\r\nIf later on fresh segments appear in the motions, then the treatment must\r\nbe repeated.\r\n\r\n_Round Worm._—The round worm resembles the garden worm and is several\r\ninches in length; it may be observed in the vomit but more commonly is\r\nseen in the motions. The symptoms are similar to those caused by the tape\r\nworm and the treatment is the same, except that, instead of the male\r\nfern, two to five grains of santonin should be given in a little milk;\r\nand the treatment repeated every other day for a week.\r\n\r\n_Threadworm._—The threadworm is a small round worm usually measuring less\r\nthan half an inch in length; it inhabits the lower end of the bowel and\r\ncauses great heat and itching about the outlet, especially at night.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Wash out the lower bowel and inject into it about a third of\r\na pint of tea, or a similar quantity of water containing one teaspoonful\r\nof salt, tannin, or alum; then apply a little mercurial ointment around\r\nthe outlet to diminish irritation. This should be done every third day\r\ntill the worms have disappeared from the motions.\r\n\r\n_The Guinea Worm._—The guinea worm often measures several feet in length;\r\nit chiefly causes trouble in the feet, ankles, and legs, where in order\r\nto obtain an exit from the body it penetrates the skin, causing a small\r\nulcer at its point of exit.\r\n\r\nUsually the presence of the guinea worm is attended with inflammation and\r\nthe formation of matter.\r\n\r\n_Prophylaxis._—Infected persons should be kept away from water supplies,\r\nand such sources of water supply as wells and water holes should be\r\nprotected. In areas where guinea worm occurs, all water should be\r\nboiled. If this cannot be managed, it should be filtered through a piece\r\nof clean cotton cloth, as this will remove from it the small crustacean\r\nin which the larva of the guinea worm develops. Another method of\r\ntreating infected water is by means of permanganate of potash, one ounce\r\nto every 2,000 gallons of well water. Caustic potash and quicklime are\r\nalso effective.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—When the worm can be seen at the base of the little ulcer,\r\nit may be secured to a piece of match and a small portion may be wound on\r\nto the match daily. If attempts are made to forcibly draw it out, it will\r\nprobably break and violent inflammation will result. During the time that\r\nthe worm is being wound out, the part should be kept very clean and an\r\nantiseptic ointment applied.\r\n\r\nThere are other methods of treatment, but these can only be carried out\r\nunder medical supervision.\r\n\r\n_The Hook Worm._—This is the American name for one or other of the\r\nspecies of ankylostomes which infect man. The disease they cause is\r\nknown as ankylostomiasis, and it is common in many parts of the world,\r\nespecially in the tropics. It chiefly affects natives, owing to their\r\nhabits; but it occurs also in Europeans.\r\n\r\n_Cause._—Hook worms are small, almost cylindrical worms, which inhabit\r\nthe human small intestine, to the wall of which they attach themselves\r\nby means of their mouths, which are furnished with formidable hooks and\r\nlancets. They suck blood, and the symptoms they produce are due in part\r\nto loss of blood, in part to the destruction of the lining membrane of\r\nthe bowel, and possibly also in part to the effects of a poison which\r\nthey are believed to excrete. Their eggs are passed in the excrement, and\r\ndevelop in the infected soil into larvæ, which are able to penetrate the\r\nunbroken skin if they come in contact with it. This is the most important\r\nroute of infection, but it may occur also by means of infected drinking\r\nwater and from contaminated food.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._—The most marked feature of the disease is anæmia, which is\r\noften associated with digestive troubles. Palpitation of the heart and\r\nshortness of breath are frequently met with. In bad cases the appetite\r\nis disordered or depraved. The patient becomes pot-bellied, and there\r\nis swelling, chiefly about the face and ankles. The face is frequently\r\npuffy, and the skin assumes a peculiar earthy hue. It should be noted\r\nthat a very early symptom is what is called ground itch. This is a skin\r\neruption, usually on the feet and legs, due to the irritation caused by\r\nthe larvæ penetrating the epidermis.\r\n\r\n_Prophylaxis._—The chief measure consists in preventing contamination of\r\nthe soil by infected excrement. It is therefore important when camping to\r\nmake proper provision in the way of latrines. Care must also be taken to\r\nprevent the fouling of water and food stuffs, such as vegetables, which\r\nare eaten uncooked. It is very dangerous to go about bare-foot in regions\r\nwhere the disease occurs, and camping sites should always be thoroughly\r\ncleansed.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Efficient treatment can only be carried out in association\r\nwith microscopic examination of the stools, and hence all that need\r\nhere be said is that various worm medicines are employed, of which\r\nthe most effectual are thymol and oil of chenopodium. These should be\r\nadministered only under careful medical supervision. The anæmia has to\r\nbe treated, and in the case of natives a nutritious and easily-digested\r\ndiet is indicated; for example, for native coolies the following has been\r\nrecommended: bread 1 pound, milk 2 pints, sugar 2 ounces, 2 eggs, and 4\r\nbananas daily. Ground itch should be treated by an ointment containing\r\nzinc oxide and salicylic acid.\r\n\r\n_The Bilharzia Worm._—This worm, of which there are two species, produces\r\nthe disease known as Bilharziasis or Schistosomiasis, which occurs in one\r\nor other, or both forms, in various parts of the world, but is specially\r\nprevalent in Egypt.\r\n\r\n_Cause._—The worms, which produce either urinary or rectal bilharziasis,\r\nlive in parts of the human vascular system, where they produce their\r\neggs. These eggs are furnished with spines, and hence cause irritation\r\nwhen lodged in the tissues. In the urinary form the eggs have a terminal\r\nspine, in the intestinal form the spine is lateral. These eggs are passed\r\neither in the urine or in the excreta and reach water, where they develop\r\ninto larvæ. The larvæ enter special species of water snails, in which\r\nthey develop, producing eventually tiny forms known as cercariæ. These\r\ncercariæ escape into the water and can penetrate the unbroken skin or\r\nintact mucous membrane. They thus get access to the bodies of persons who\r\nare bathing in the infected water, or who may drink it. Once in the human\r\nbody, the blood carries them to the place where they develop into the\r\nadult worms, which eventually unite, and then the females begin producing\r\nthe spined eggs.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._—In the urinary form the chief symptom is the passage of\r\nbloody urine, which usually shows itself about three months after\r\ninfection, and is often associated with a good deal of irritation of the\r\nbladder and the pipe. The intestinal form may produce various symptoms.\r\nSometimes a condition resembling enteric fever occurs, sometimes one\r\nlike dysentery. Diarrhœa is common. The condition is chronic and, if\r\nuntreated, sets up all kinds of secondary effects, which need not be\r\ndiscussed.\r\n\r\n_Prophylaxis._—Carefully avoid any kind of personal contact with water\r\nwhich may by any possibility be infected from urine or fæces. Bathing,\r\nwading, washing in, or drinking any such waters, are all dangerous.\r\nWherever possible, water which may be infected should be boiled. If\r\nthis cannot be done, sodium bisulphate tablets may be used; two of the\r\n16-grain water-purifying tablets in a quart water-bottle full of water\r\nare efficient. Filtration through a Pasteur-Chamberland or Doulton candle\r\nis efficient, as it excludes the cercariæ. Bathing water can be rendered\r\nsafe for immediate use by the addition of undiluted Army cresol in a\r\ndilution of 1 in 10,000. If the water is kept overnight, 1 in 90,000 is\r\nsufficient, as the storage of water tends to diminish infection.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Certain forms of antimony have been found to cure the\r\ncondition, but can only be administered by a medical man. Indeed,\r\neither form of bilharziasis can be properly treated only under medical\r\nsupervision. If this is not obtainable, some relief can be afforded by\r\nthe use of urotropin and sedative drugs.\r\n\r\nThere are many other worm diseases which afflict man, but no good object\r\nwould be served by mentioning them in detail. Most of them can be\r\ndiagnosed with certainty only by a medical man using the microscope, and\r\nthey all require scientific treatment which is beyond the scope of the\r\nordinary traveller.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Yellow Fever._\r\n\r\nThis disease, the “Yellow Jack” of naval historians, occurs, so far as is\r\nknown, only in parts of the New World and on the West Coast of Africa.\r\nOne attack usually protects permanently against a second.\r\n\r\n_Cause._—Quite recently the organism has apparently been discovered. It\r\nis a corkscrew-shaped parasite which exists in the blood, and which is\r\nallied to, though not identical with, the parasites of relapsing fever\r\nand tick fever. The infection is conveyed from one patient to another by\r\nthe mosquito _Stegomyia fasciata_, which is a black and white insect,\r\ncommonly known from its striped legs as the tiger mosquito. Incubation\r\nperiod two to five days.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._—The onset of the disease is very sudden, the highest\r\ntemperature being reached almost at once; then follows a period of\r\nremission or calm, the pulse becomes abnormally slow, and this stage is\r\nusually either succeeded by convalescence, or the symptoms become worse\r\nand the patient dies. Some of the symptoms much resemble malaria, but the\r\nrapidity of the onset, severe pain in the forehead, eyes, and loins, the\r\nearly scantiness of the urine, the marked jaundice, the bright eyes, the\r\nnarrow red tongue, and the absence of pain about the spleen are fairly\r\ncharacteristic.\r\n\r\nThere is considerable thirst and vomiting, and in bad cases the vomit\r\nbecomes black, the colour being due to the presence of blood. (In\r\nordinary malaria the vomit is yellow, or in severe cases, such as\r\nblackwater fever, it may be of a bright or dark-green colour.) In yellow\r\nfever, jaundice is developed about the third day, and tends to increase,\r\nwhilst in blackwater fever it comes on very early and soon begins to\r\nabate.\r\n\r\nAn important diagnostic sign in yellow fever is found in the fact that\r\nthe pulse does not increase in rapidity as the temperature rises.\r\n\r\n_Prophylaxis._—Avoid being bitten by mosquitoes, employing the methods\r\nmentioned on pages 206, 207. It must be remembered that _Stegomyia\r\nfasciata_, unlike the anopheline mosquitoes, bites during the day, and\r\ntherefore it is more difficult to avoid its unwelcome attentions. It\r\nusually breeds in the neighbourhood of houses, being what may be called\r\na domestic mosquito; and it is of the greatest importance to abolish\r\nall potential breeding places or to protect them from the mosquito.\r\nPractically any vessel holding water may become a nursery for Stegomyia,\r\nand it is remarkable in what small quantities of water this mosquito will\r\nlay her eggs. Patients suffering from the disease must be isolated and\r\nkept under a mosquito net or in a mosquito-proof chamber, in order to\r\nprevent them from infecting mosquitoes, which they are capable of doing\r\nin the early part of the disease.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Open the bowels well by means of calomel, six grains,\r\nfollowed by a saline purge and hot-water enema. Some prefer castor oil\r\nin large doses. Give ten grains of bicarbonate of soda three times a day.\r\nGive cooling drinks, such as fruit salt. Make the skin act. Apply hot\r\nfomentations to the back and mustard leaves to the pit of the stomach.\r\n\r\nThe question of feeding is very important. During the first two or three\r\ndays of the fever the patient is better without any food at all. As he\r\nrecovers his appetite returns, and great care must be exercised about\r\ngratifying it. Only the plainest foods in very small quantities should be\r\npermitted, the amounts being gradually increased, as otherwise relapses\r\nmay occur. Stimulants are usually required in the later stages of the\r\nfever, but they must be carefully employed as they may tend to increase\r\nthe vomiting. It is possible that the discovery of the parasite may lead\r\nto new and more efficient methods of treating the disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDICINES, MEDICAL APPLIANCES, ETC.\r\n\r\nWEIGHTS AND MEASURES.\r\n\r\n_Solids._\r\n\r\n                 A Grain                  Symbol  Gr.\r\n  20 Grains      1 Scruple { weights now    ”      ℈\r\n  60 Grains      1 Drachm  { rarely used    ”      ℨ\r\n  437.5 Grains   1 Ounce                    ”      ℥\r\n  16 Ounces      1 Pound                    ”      ℔\r\n\r\n_Note._—An ounce weighs not 8 but rather under 7½ drachms.\r\n\r\n  1 Gramme          about 15½ grains.\r\n  1 Kilogramme        ”   2 lbs. 3¼ ozs.\r\n\r\n_Liquids._\r\n\r\n  1  Minim                       About 1 drop, or 0.06 c.c.

Poisons should be kept in bottles of a special shape.\r\n\r\nDrugs in a liquid state are inconvenient for travellers. They are bulky,\r\nand require very careful packing and handling.\r\n\r\nAs far as possible, therefore, compressed drugs should be selected. These\r\nmust be of good quality.\r\n\r\nTablets are often taken in the solid form, but they will act more quickly\r\nand certainly if dissolved or suspended in about an ounce of water.\r\n\r\nSome preparations, chiefly those used for preparing lotions, etc.,\r\n_e.g._, of chinosol, are also made in compressed form.\r\n\r\nIn regard to drugs, I have kept well within the maximum dose, so that\r\nthere may be no trouble on that account. For instance, in certain cases a\r\nmedical man would give sixty drops of laudanum for a dose, but I advise\r\ntravellers rarely to give more than sixty drops in twenty-four hours. The\r\nurgency of the case must be the guide as to the quantity of the drug to\r\nbe given. The smallest dose which is effective is the best.\r\n\r\nA supply of antiseptic gauze, wool and lint is necessary. The compressed\r\nforms are very convenient.\r\n\r\nAll antiseptic gauzes and other dressings should be very carefully\r\nprotected from the air in order that their properties may be preserved.\r\nThey should be wrapped in oiled paper or india-rubber tissue, and kept in\r\na tin box.\r\n\r\nA supply of bandages will also be needed. Each bandage should be two\r\ninches in width by six feet in length.\r\n\r\n_Dressing case._—The traveller should provide himself with a surgical\r\ndressing case. A suitable one should contain 1 pair of scissors, 1 pair\r\nof Spencer Wells’ artery forceps, 1 probe, 1 scoop and grooved director,\r\n1 knife with two blades, 1 small saw with a detachable handle, and a\r\npacket containing silk, wire, needles, and pins.\r\n\r\nAll active poisons mentioned in the following pages are marked with an\r\nasterisk (*).\r\n\r\n_Aloin Co. tablets._—One taken three times a day after meals, in chronic\r\nconstipation, gradually reduced as bowels become regular.\r\n\r\n_Alum._—Dose, five to ten grains. Is occasionally used as an internal\r\nastringent in the treatment of diarrhœa.\r\n\r\nA solution containing five grains to the ounce of water may be used as\r\na mouth wash for bleeding or inflamed gums, as a gargle for relaxed and\r\nsore throats, or as a lotion for inflamed eyes.\r\n\r\nTen to twenty ounces of a solution containing five grains to the ounce is\r\nsometimes used as an enema to check the diarrhœa in chronic dysentery.\r\n\r\nThe tablet of alum weighs ten grains.\r\n\r\n_Ammonia._—Three preparations of ammonia, viz., Sal volatile, Carbonate\r\nof ammonia, and Liquor ammoniæ, are extremely valuable as stimulants,\r\nand in this respect they are to be preferred to alcohol. All three are\r\nsimilar in their action, and are useful on account of their stimulating\r\neffect upon the heart in cases of fainting, or collapse caused by\r\nsnake-bite, bullet-wound, or other injury; they relieve spasm, and\r\npromote sweating in feverish states. They also cause free expectoration,\r\nand are therefore useful in the later stages of bronchitis.\r\n\r\nThe chief objection to these drugs is that their strength is rapidly\r\nlost, unless they are kept in well-stoppered bottles, and in the dark.\r\n\r\nAll preparations of ammonia should be administered in about one ounce of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n_Sal volatile, or aromatic spirit of ammonia._—Dose, twenty to sixty\r\ndrops for a single administration, or up to thirty drops if repeated\r\nfrequently. This is the most convenient and pleasant preparation of\r\nammonia, but is bulky. As a local application, it is of service in\r\nrelieving the pain caused by the bites of certain insects, _e.g._,\r\nmosquitoes and fleas.\r\n\r\n_Carbonate of ammonia._—Dose, three to ten grains.\r\n\r\n_Liquor ammoniæ, or solution of ammonia._—Dose, five to twenty drops.\r\n\r\n(_Note._—This is not the strong solution, which is always labelled “Liq.\r\nAmmon. Fort.,” and which is three times stronger than liquor ammoniæ.)\r\n\r\n_Ammonium chloride._—Dose, five to twenty grains. This drug is chiefly\r\nused in congestion of the liver, especially where acute inflammation or\r\nabscess is threatened; at times it is useful in neuralgia and chronic\r\nbronchitis. It is also used for inflamed and relaxed sore throat, in the\r\nform of a gargle, five to ten grains to the ounce of water.\r\n\r\n_Antipyrine._—Dose, five to ten grains. (Uses as Phenacetin.)\r\n\r\n* _Araroba, Chrysarobin, or Goa powder._—Is not for internal use. One\r\npart of the powder mixed with one of acetic acid and fourteen of lard\r\nmakes what is known as araroba ointment.\r\n\r\n_Araroba ointment_ is useful in many skin diseases, such as psoriasis;\r\nit easily destroys the parasites in ringworm, dhobie itch, or kraw kraw.\r\nIt is a powerful drug, and should be used only in small amounts, for if\r\napplied too freely it will cause some inflammation and pain. Care must be\r\ntaken that it is not rubbed into the eyes.\r\n\r\n* _Aromatic chalk with opium tablets._—Ten grains three times a day in\r\nsevere cases of diarrhœa.\r\n\r\n* _Arsenic._—Dose, one-sixtieth to one-fifteenth of a grain. Is a\r\npowerful and poisonous drug, and should be taken with caution. It is\r\nuseful in chronic malaria, and in anæmia and debility, especially that\r\nfollowing an attack of fever.\r\n\r\nIt is best combined with iron in tablet form—iron and arsenic tablet—two\r\nof which may be taken twice a day, after food, for a week. This is a good\r\ngeneral tonic.\r\n\r\n_Aspirin._—Dose 5 to 15 grains. Should be taken with a drink of water.\r\nUseful in rheumatic and febrile conditions; often relieves headache\r\nand the feeling of discomfort associated with chill. It is apt to be\r\ndepressing in large doses, and some persons do not tolerate it well.\r\nSpeaking generally it may be used in those conditions in which salicylate\r\nof soda is indicated.\r\n\r\n_Bismuth carbonate._—Dose, five to twenty grains. Useful in dyspepsia,\r\npain in the stomach, vomiting and diarrhœa. The drug is heavy, and\r\ntherefore gum or starch water should be used to suspend it.\r\n\r\nIt is often combined with opium and bicarbonate of soda to check vomiting\r\nand diarrhœa.\r\n\r\nBismuth may also be used as a dusting powder.\r\n\r\n_Boric acid, or boracic acid._—Chiefly used in solution, for its mild\r\nantiseptic properties, as a gargle, injection, eye lotion, or mouth wash.\r\nOn the same account, it is used for washing wounds, or syringing out\r\nulcers, or sore and inflamed ears. It is practically non-poisonous.\r\n\r\nLotions should contain from five to ten grains to the ounce. Boric\r\nointment is a useful dressing for sores, burns, or wounds; it may be made\r\nby adding one part of powdered boric acid to nine of vaseline or fat.\r\n\r\nEqual parts of finely-powdered boric acid, zinc oxide and starch makes a\r\ngood dusting powder for moist eczema, bed-sores, chafes, and perspiring\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nBoric lint (lint impregnated with boric acid) is useful as a dressing for\r\nwounds, ulcers, and abrasions.\r\n\r\nBoric wool is absorbent cotton-wool impregnated with boric acid, and is\r\nthe most generally useful antiseptic wool.\r\n\r\n_Bromides._—The bromides generally used are those of potassium, or\r\nammonium. Dose in either case, five to twenty-five grains. They are\r\nsedatives, and are used in convulsions, epilepsy, and delirium; they\r\nrelieve headache, especially if taken with sal volatile, and may be\r\ncombined with chloral (_see_ Chloral). The bromide of ammonium is less\r\ndepressing than the bromide of potassium.\r\n\r\n_Calcium sulphide, i.e., sulphurated lime._—Dose, a quarter to one grain\r\nthree times a day. Useful for those who are suffering from boils or\r\ncarbuncles.\r\n\r\n* _Calomel, or subchloride of mercury._—Dose, two to five grains. Calomel\r\nmay be used in almost all cases requiring an aperient; its action will be\r\nassisted by giving fruit salt, or citrate of magnesia, four hours later.\r\nIn cases of insensibility or delirium it is specially useful, for the\r\npowder may be placed on the back of the tongue, and it will be swallowed\r\nunconsciously.\r\n\r\nFour grains of calomel may usually be given with advantage, at the\r\nbeginning of a malarial attack.\r\n\r\nIn syphilis, one grain may be given two or three times a day; but its\r\naction should be watched, and if it causes salivation, tenderness of the\r\ngums, and a coppery taste in the mouth, it should be discontinued until\r\nthese symptoms disappear.\r\n\r\n_Camphor._—Dose, two to five grains. Is a stimulant, and an\r\nantispasmodic; it helps to calm the nervous system. It is used in cholera\r\nand in fevers, and is taken for colds in the head.\r\n\r\nCamphor is slightly soluble in water, and this solution makes a cooling\r\nlotion, which is useful for inflamed or painful parts. A lump of camphor\r\nis a good repellent for sand-flies.\r\n\r\n_Spirit of camphor_ consists of one part of camphor in ten of alcohol;\r\nthe dose is ten to twenty drops.\r\n\r\n_Camphorated oil_ consists of one ounce of camphor in four ounces of\r\nolive oil, and makes a stimulating liniment for stiff and painful parts.\r\nA stronger liniment may be made by adding to this an ounce of spirit, and\r\nhalf to one ounce of solution of ammonia or oil of turpentine.\r\n\r\n* _Carbolic acid, or phenol._—Dose, one or two grains may be given\r\ninternally, well diluted, for acute diarrhœa, dysentery, and cholera. Is\r\nmostly used as an external application. Carbolic acid acts as a caustic,\r\nand may be applied on the end of a match in the case of boils (p. 227). A\r\ndrop on a piece of cotton-wool applied to a hollow tooth quickly relieves\r\npain.\r\n\r\nIt is much used as an antiseptic lotion for wounds and foul sores, and\r\nfor cleansing hands and instruments before operation.\r\n\r\nOne part in twenty of water makes a strong solution for cleansing\r\ninstruments and disinfecting dysenteric and other stools.\r\n\r\nOne part in sixty may be used for sponging or syringing sores and wounds.\r\n\r\nOne part added to nineteen of olive, or other oil, makes carbolic oil,\r\nwhich is a handy dressing for all kinds of wounds.\r\n\r\nOne part to nineteen parts of vaseline, or fresh lard, makes carbolic\r\nointment.\r\n\r\n_Cascara sagrada, extract of._—Dose, two to six grains. Is a valuable\r\naperient, especially in chronic constipation. Cascara tablets, two grains\r\neach, are convenient, and one or two should be taken at night.\r\n\r\n_Cathartic Co. Tablets._—A useful purge in cases of fever or liver\r\nderangement. Two or three for a dose when required.\r\n\r\n_Castor oil._—Dose, one to three tablespoonfuls. It is a good aperient,\r\nbut is not very convenient for the traveller, as it takes up much space,\r\nwhich could be better used for aperients which are not so bulky, _e.g._,\r\ncalomel or cascara. The usual dose of castor oil should be somewhat\r\nreduced in the tropics, where it is often not so well borne as in\r\ntemperate climates.\r\n\r\n_Note._—The seeds of the castor oil plant should not be eaten, as they\r\nare poisonous.\r\n\r\n_Chinosol_ is a drug which has many of the advantages of carbolic acid\r\nwithout its poisonous or caustic properties. It is so generally useful\r\nthat, at any rate for explorers, it will largely replace carbolic acid.\r\nIt is antiseptic and disinfectant in its action, can be used as a\r\nmouth wash or gargle, for sore gums and ulcerated throats; it makes a\r\ngood lotion for washing the hands, instruments, or wounds, and may be\r\nsyringed into fresh wounds or into chronic ulcers.\r\n\r\nIt is put up in the compressed form, each tablet weighing eight and\r\nthree-quarter grains, and the strength of the solutions here given are\r\ncalculated strictly from this weight.\r\n\r\nOne tablet dissolved in a pint of water makes a solution of 1 in 1000\r\n(equal to about 1 in 40, carbolic lotion), which is the most useful\r\nfor general purposes, such as an antiseptic wash for the hands or for\r\ndisinfecting surgical instruments.\r\n\r\nA tablet in two pints of water makes a solution of 1 in 2000. This may be\r\nused for washing fresh wounds, burns, and suppurating surfaces, or as a\r\ngargle for sore throat.\r\n\r\nAs a healing dusting powder, one part of chinosol may be mixed with ten\r\nof boric acid, and used in the same manner as iodoform powder.\r\n\r\nTo disinfect typhoid or dysenteric stools, dissolve four tablets in one\r\npint of water and add the mixture to the vessel containing the motions.\r\n\r\n* _Chloral._—Dose, five to twenty grains. Relieves restlessness and\r\ndelirium, and produces sleep. Larger doses than twenty grains should\r\nnot be given. In severe convulsions, due to certain poisons, _e.g._,\r\nstrychnine, twenty grains or more of bromide of potassium may be added to\r\nthe full dose of chloral, and given either by the mouth or bowel.\r\n\r\n* _Chloroform._—Dose, one to five drops. Two to four drops can be given\r\nwith advantage with almost any drug, as a flavouring agent, and on\r\naccount of its antispasmodic action.\r\n\r\nFrom two to four drops put on a piece of loaf sugar and sucked will often\r\nstop sea-sickness or other vomiting.\r\n\r\n_Spirits of Chloroform, or Chloric Ether_, consisting of one part of\r\nchloroform in twenty parts of alcohol, is a convenient form in which to\r\nadminister the drug. It is useful in sea-sickness, cramps and colic, and\r\nshould be given in doses of twenty drops added to a teaspoonful of water\r\nevery quarter of an hour, until six such doses have been given.\r\n\r\n* _Cocaine._—A one per cent. solution may be used to diminish pain in\r\nthe eye caused by injury or a piece of grit lodging under the lids. Two\r\ndrops should be applied to the eyeball, and in about two minutes the\r\napplication may be repeated; in another minute the sensibility of the\r\npart will be diminished, and a careful examination may be made for dust\r\nor other foreign bodies, which should of course be cautiously removed.\r\n\r\n_Creosote._—Dose, one to two drops; is best given in a capsule. In many\r\ncases of indigestion it gives great relief if administered immediately\r\nafter food. Creosote applied to a hollow tooth, upon a piece of\r\ncotton-wool, will usually relieve the pain.\r\n\r\n_Cresol._—This is a valuable disinfectant which is found on the market\r\nunder several names.\r\n\r\n* _Croton Oil._—Dose, half to one or two drops, mixed with bread crumb or\r\nin a pill.\r\n\r\nIs a powerful purgative not usually given to Europeans. Native carriers\r\nlike it. Useful in the case of unconscious patients, given in butter.\r\n\r\n_Copaiba, Balsam of._—Dose, five to twenty drops three times a day. Is\r\nbest taken in capsules. It increases the expectoration, and is therefore\r\nuseful in bronchitis; is a stimulating disinfectant to the urine, bladder\r\nand pipe, and is used in gonorrhœa and inflammation of the bladder.\r\nIt may produce an irritating rash on the skin if taken in too large\r\nquantities.\r\n\r\n_Emetics._—The following are the usual emetics:—\r\n\r\n  Common salt, two tablespoonfuls in half a pint of water.\r\n  Mustard, one tablespoonful           ”            ”\r\n  Ipecacuanha, thirty grains           ”            ”\r\n  Zinc sulphate, thirty grains         ”            ”\r\n\r\nIn the absence of any of the above, give copious draughts of tepid water,\r\nfollowed by tickling the back of the throat with the finger or a feather.\r\n\r\n_Emetine._—The active principle of ipecacuanha. Of great value in amœbic\r\ndysentery (p. 187).\r\n\r\n_Enema._—_Nutrient enema_:\r\n\r\n  Two eggs,\r\n  Half teaspoonful of salt,\r\n  A wine-glassful of milk.\r\n\r\nBeat up the eggs, then add the salt and milk, and mix well. Raise the\r\nhips and inject slowly through the long tube well up into the bowel.\r\n\r\n_Nutrient enema_:\r\n\r\n  Benger’s beef jelly, two tablespoonfuls,\r\n  Milk, about three ounces.\r\n\r\n_Warm-water enema._ To relieve uneasiness of lower bowel, as in\r\ndysentery, piles, etc., half a pint or more of warm water, by the short\r\ntube.\r\n\r\n_Soothing enema._ Laudanum, thirty drops; warm water about two ounces. A\r\nlittle thin starch water or gum may be added. Inject through the short\r\ntube, and repeat the injection in three hours if patient is not easier.\r\n\r\n_Quinine enema._ Quinine, twenty grains or more; warm water, about two\r\nounces. If the patient does not retain the injection, give a second one\r\nwithin an hour. Select a soluble preparation of quinine, such as the\r\nbisulphate or the hydrobromide.\r\n\r\n_Aperient enema._ Lather soap in thirty ounces of warm water, using\r\nplenty of soap to make a good solution; or use plain warm water or weak\r\ngruel; the addition of one or two tablespoonfuls of oil is of advantage.\r\nInject slowly into the bowel with short tube; if it does not cause\r\nuneasiness, inject the whole amount. The injection should be retained as\r\nlong as possible.\r\n\r\n_Epsom salts, or sulphate of magnesia._ Dose, two teaspoonfuls or\r\nmore. Is a saline purgative, giving a copious watery motion, rapid in\r\nits action, and useful in fevers or congestion of the liver. It also\r\nincreases the flow of urine.\r\n\r\nRecently has been much used in dysentery (p. 189).\r\n\r\n_Friar’s Balsam._—(Tinct. Benzoin Co.) Dose, thirty drops or more.\r\n\r\nInternally is useful as an expectorant in bronchitis. Can also be\r\nemployed as an inhalation.\r\n\r\nExternally, lint soaked with it is an efficient dressing for wounds and\r\nsores. When first applied it causes a good deal of smarting, but this\r\nsoon passes off.\r\n\r\n_Gall and opium ointment_ is a useful application for piles.\r\n\r\n_Gauze, antiseptic._ The best dressing for wounds is some form of\r\nantiseptic gauze. Cyanide gauze, which is impregnated with cyanide of\r\nmercury, is the most generally used.\r\n\r\n_Ginger, essence of._—Dose, five to twenty drops. It is useful in cases\r\nof cramp, colic, and indigestion, especially if combined with five or ten\r\ngrains of bicarbonate of soda and two or three drops of chloroform.\r\n\r\nIf there is much pain, ten drops or more of chlorodyne or laudanum may be\r\nadded.\r\n\r\n* _Goa powder._—_See_ Araroba.\r\n\r\n* _Goulard water._—For external use only. Is astringent, and may be used\r\nas a lotion for inflamed joints. Is also useful as an injection in\r\ngonorrhœa and gleet, as a soothing lotion in herpes, shingles, eczema,\r\ndischarge from the ear, and itching and chafes of all kinds. _It should\r\nnot be used as an eye lotion._\r\n\r\nGoulard water is made by adding one part of Liquor Plumbi Subacetatis\r\nFortis, or Goulard _Extract_, and one of alcohol to seventy-eight of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nOne of the tablets of the subacetate of lead added to a quarter of a pint\r\nof water (distilled when convenient) makes a solution similar to Goulard\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n_Gum acacia_ is used for forming a mucilage with which to suspend such\r\ndrugs as carbonate of bismuth. One part of gum to three of water should\r\nbe made and strained before use. Starch may be used for the same purpose.\r\n\r\n_Hazeline._—Dose, thirty to one hundred and twenty drops. It is a\r\npowerful astringent. May be applied freely to bleeding parts, such as the\r\nnose, gums, piles, or small wounds. One tablespoonful of hazeline to five\r\nof water may be injected into the bowel for bleeding piles. Hazeline snow\r\nis an elegant preparation for sunburn and other skin affections.\r\n\r\n_Ichthyol._—An ointment containing twenty per cent. of ichthyol is\r\nvery soothing in most skin diseases, such as eczema and psoriasis. The\r\nointment is of service in reducing the pain and swelling of mosquito\r\nbites.\r\n\r\n_Iodide of potassium._—Dose, five to ten grains in the later stages of\r\nsyphilis.\r\n\r\n* _Iodine, tincture of._—Dose, two drops in a teaspoonful of water; given\r\nevery hour, is most valuable for obstinate vomiting.\r\n\r\nUsed externally, it acts as a counter-irritant, and should not be painted\r\non too freely as it may cause blistering. Does good if painted over\r\nswollen joints or enlarged glands, but should not be applied if the skin\r\nthere is broken. Tincture of iodine may be painted on the chest or over\r\nthe liver or spleen if there is pain. It is a valuable application for\r\nall open, recent wounds, and may be painted freely over and round the raw\r\nsurface. It relieves the irritation of mosquito bites.\r\n\r\nIs very useful in certain diseases of the skin, such as ringworm, kraw\r\nkraw, and dhobie itch.\r\n\r\n_Iodoform powder_ is a valuable antiseptic, and is used for all kinds\r\nof sores, or wounds, in which it rapidly promotes healing. One part of\r\niodoform to eight parts of vaseline makes a good healing ointment.\r\n\r\n  _Ipecacuanha._—Dose, expectorant, half to two grains.\r\n                 ”    emetic, fifteen to thirty grains.\r\n                 ”    for dysentery, twenty to forty grains or more.\r\n\r\nIn small doses, _e.g._, a quarter to half a grain, is a stomachic and may\r\ncheck vomiting.\r\n\r\nWas formerly much used in amœbic dysentery (p. 187). Its active\r\nprinciple, emetine, is now employed.\r\n\r\nBy causing free expectoration, it is very useful in bronchitis, and is\r\nthen usually combined with ammonia.\r\n\r\nIs contained in Dover’s powder, and in this form is useful in coughs and\r\ncolds, as it helps to cause sweating.\r\n\r\n_Iron._—Iron is much used on account of its tonic and blood-forming\r\nproperties. It is especially useful in anæmia following fevers and other\r\nexhausting diseases, and it also gives tone to the nervous system.\r\n\r\nMost preparations of iron are astringent in their action, some such\r\nas the sulphate and perchloride being more so than others; these are,\r\ntherefore, useful in diarrhœa and in bleeding from the gums and bowel.\r\nIron by its astringent action may cause constipation, and it may be\r\nnecessary to add a small amount of an aperient, such as Epsom salts, to\r\neach dose.\r\n\r\nThe following preparations are those generally used:—\r\n\r\n_Tincture or perchloride of iron, or tincture of steel._—Dose, five to\r\nfifteen drops in at least an ounce of water. Good blood tonic. Is very\r\nastringent, and is therefore useful in internal bleeding and looseness of\r\nthe bowels. It is of value in erysipelas.\r\n\r\n_Sulphate of iron._—Dose, one to three grains. Is a powerful astringent\r\nand blood tonic, and often does good in checking the looseness of the\r\nbowels which remains after an attack of dysentery.\r\n\r\n_Iron pill or Blaud’s pill._—Dose, five to fifteen grains. Is one of the\r\nbest tonic preparations of iron, as it is not very astringent. It is put\r\nup in tablet form.\r\n\r\n_Solution of dialysed iron._—Dose, ten to thirty drops. Is a good blood\r\ntonic, and, unlike most preparations, is not astringent.\r\n\r\n_Parrish’s food._—Dose, thirty to a hundred and twenty drops in water. Is\r\na good preparation of iron for children.\r\n\r\n_Iron and arsenic compound tablets._—A useful tonic in convalescence from\r\nmalaria, one taken three times a day after meals.\r\n\r\n_Mercurial ointment_ forms a useful application in certain skin diseases.\r\nAs it is rather strong, it should be diluted with two parts of vaseline.\r\n\r\n_White precipitate, or ammoniated mercurial ointment._—Useful in the case\r\nof head lice and several parasitic skin diseases.\r\n\r\n_Naso-pharyngeal Tablets._—Useful in nasal catarrh and pharyngitis.\r\n\r\n* _Opium._—Is a valuable drug, but it is also a poison, and great care\r\nshould be observed in using it. Opium is narcotic and sedative in its\r\naction; it relieves pain of all kinds. Useful in diarrhœa, dysentery,\r\ncramp and colic. Promotes perspiration and checks vomiting. Sometimes it\r\nwill cut short a cold or mitigate an attack of malaria.\r\n\r\n_No preparation containing opium should be given to children without\r\nmedical advice, and the same is true as regards persons suffering from\r\nkidney disease._\r\n\r\nThe chief preparations containing opium are:—\r\n\r\n* _Chlorodyne._—The ordinary dose is ten to fifteen drops, but if there\r\nis great pain, then even thirty or forty drops may be given, but a second\r\ndose should not be administered for three or four hours; if two full\r\ndoses have been given, do not give a third within at least twelve hours\r\nof the second dose, and do not give it at all if the patient is drowsy.\r\n\r\nIt is best not to give more than forty to sixty drops in twenty-four\r\nhours, unless there are very special reasons for giving a larger\r\nquantity. Is to be preferred to laudanum, as it is more palatable and\r\nmore readily stops vomiting.\r\n\r\n* _Laudanum, or tincture of opium._—The doses and uses are precisely\r\nsimilar to those of chlorodyne. Laudanum has been put up in the\r\ncompressed form, and is very convenient for transport.\r\n\r\n* _Dover’s powder, or compound ipecacuanha powder._—Dose five to fifteen\r\ngrains. It contains opium and a small amount of ipecacuanha. Ten grains\r\nof Dover’s powder are equal to about fifteen drops of chlorodyne or\r\nlaudanum. The tablet is an extremely handy preparation. Dover’s powder\r\nis especially useful in coughs and colds, the ipecacuanha it contains\r\nassisting the action of the opium. If a patient who is chilled is put to\r\nbed at once, kept warm with blankets and hot-water bottles, and is given\r\nten or fifteen grains with a hot drink, he will perspire, and possibly\r\nthe cold will be cut short.\r\n\r\n_Peppermint, spirits of._—Dose, five to twenty drops. Is a valuable\r\ndrug in cases of flatulence and dyspepsia, especially if combined with\r\nbicarbonate of soda; it also masks the taste of unpleasant medicines. For\r\nchildren, one drop of the spirit and one grain of bicarbonate of soda may\r\nbe added to one teaspoonful of water, and this dose may be frequently\r\nrepeated.\r\n\r\n_Pepsin tablets_, a useful digestive product, taken with food when\r\ndigestion is weak, or may be used to predigest it.\r\n\r\n* _Perchloride of mercury tablets_, for making lotions for disinfecting\r\nwounds, etc.\r\n\r\n_Phenacetin._—Dose, three to eight grains. Phenacetin is used for\r\nheadaches, or for reducing the temperature in malaria and other febrile\r\ndiseases, and to cause sweating. As it is very insoluble, it is best\r\ntaken in the form of a powder, or in alcohol and hot water.\r\n\r\n_Potassium, bromide of. See_ Bromides.\r\n\r\n* _Potassium permanganate_ in solid form is a mild caustic, and is the\r\nactive principle of Condy’s fluid, which contains about eight grains of\r\nthe drug in one ounce.\r\n\r\nIt is disinfectant, deodorant, and antiseptic.\r\n\r\nOne part of this drug is soluble in about twenty parts of water.\r\n\r\nOne grain gives a purple colour to a gallon of water. Impure water turns\r\nthe purple rapidly to a brown colour, therefore the permanganate is a\r\nrough test for the presence of organic matter in water.\r\n\r\nA pale purple solution is useful as a gargle or mouth wash, also as an\r\ninjection in gonorrhœa; wounds may be cleansed with a similar solution.\r\n\r\nIt is especially useful in poisoned wounds, such as snake-bites, and\r\nshould in these cases be injected hypodermically (p. 281).\r\n\r\nIs an antidote to poisoning by opium.\r\n\r\nOf late years it has been extensively used in the treatment and\r\nprevention of cholera. The two-grain tablet is a convenient form for\r\nmedication.\r\n\r\n_Purgatives_ may be divided into the following classes:—\r\n\r\n1. Laxatives.\r\n\r\n2. Simple purgatives.\r\n\r\n3. Drastic purgatives or cathartics.\r\n\r\n4. Saline purges.\r\n\r\n1. Laxatives slightly stimulate the movements of the bowel, but cause\r\npractically no increase of the intestinal secretion. Examples of this\r\nclass are fruit, wholemeal bread, small doses of castor oil, figs,\r\nprunes, etc. These may be given regularly in slight cases of chronic\r\nconstipation.\r\n\r\n2. Simple purges are more powerful than laxatives, and in addition to\r\nstimulating the movements of the bowel increase the secretion. The result\r\nis a soft, easy motion. Examples: rhubarb, senna, cascara sagrada.\r\n\r\n3. Drastic purgatives or cathartics. The drugs cause a profuse flow of\r\nthe intestinal secretions, and, occasionally, of the bile, with greatly\r\nincreased bowel movements. They cause a copious watery evacuation,\r\naccompanied by a good deal of griping. Examples: calomel, colocynth,\r\naloes, podophyllin, croton oil, jalap and oil of turpentine; of these,\r\npodophyllin and aloes cause an increase in the flow of bile, with\r\nincreased intestinal movements, so they may be said to act directly upon\r\nthe liver. The result is a profuse, watery, bile-stained motion.\r\n\r\nCalomel does not act directly upon the liver, but stimulates the upper\r\npart of the bowel, so that its contents are hurried along before the bile\r\ncan be reabsorbed, and a loose, watery, bile-stained motion ensues.\r\n\r\nThe most useful purgative of this class is the pill containing colocynth,\r\ncalomel, and hyoscyamus, of which five to ten grains should be given when\r\nthere is a furred tongue, constipation, heaviness or weight over the\r\nliver, and dyspepsia and loss of appetite.\r\n\r\n4. Saline purgatives. These cause a free secretion of the intestinal\r\njuices, and a copious motion, proportionate to the size of the dose, is\r\nthe result. The principal saline purges are Epsom salts (_i.e._, sulphate\r\nof magnesia), Glauber’s salts (_i.e._, sulphate of soda), seidlitz\r\npowder, the various forms of fruit salts, and the aperient mineral\r\nwaters, such as Rubinat, Hunyadi Janos, etc.\r\n\r\nA saline purgative may be given in the morning, to assist the action of\r\nan aperient pill administered the previous night.\r\n\r\nSaline purgatives are useful, too, in many cases of habitual\r\nconstipation, and, if necessary, a small dose may be given every morning\r\nin a tumbler of warm water.\r\n\r\n_Quinine._—Quinine is chiefly used for malarial fever, and the urgency\r\nof the case must be the guide as to the amount to be administered. It is\r\nseldom necessary to give more than ten grains three times a day; at times\r\nenormous doses, such as thirty grains three times a day, have been given\r\nwith advantage, but such doses are rarely necessary, and in the absence\r\nof a medical man should never be given.\r\n\r\nThe administration of quinine sometimes causes headache, deafness,\r\ndelirium, and partial or even complete blindness. In such cases the\r\ndose should be reduced or the drug withheld until these symptoms have\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\n_It has been stated that quinine causes blackwater fever; this, I\r\nbelieve, is absolutely untrue._ I have seen cases of blackwater fever,\r\napparently resulting from the neglect of malarious attacks, which date\r\nthe commencement of their recovery from the first administration of\r\nquinine.\r\n\r\nQuinine is best given in solution; the nauseous taste can be somewhat\r\ndisguised by adding chloroform water or essence of ginger or lime juice\r\nto the solution. Many men take the drug in a little beer or spirit for\r\nthe same purpose.\r\n\r\nQuinine pills are, as a rule, very insoluble, therefore they are not\r\nsuitable for explorers. Quinine in the form of a tablet, or in a capsule,\r\nor wrapped in tissue paper, acts well, but even tablets should be cracked\r\nor crushed. Sugar-coated products are inadmissible in the tropics.\r\n\r\nSometimes, owing to frequent vomiting or other cause, the quinine\r\nadministered by the mouth cannot be retained. It must then be given by\r\nmeans of an enema or by injection into the muscles.\r\n\r\nIf the traveller decides to give an intra-muscular injection of quinine,\r\nhe should only give five grains at a time. The dose should be added to\r\nabout a teaspoonful of water which should then be boiled and allowed to\r\ncool. The amount of water is of little importance so long as enough is\r\nused to dissolve the drug, and keep it in solution when the water is cool\r\nenough to be injected. The less fluid, however, injected the better.\r\n\r\nInjections are best made deeply into the muscles of the buttock. This is\r\na method best left to a medical man, as there is danger of injuring the\r\nsciatic nerve.\r\n\r\n_The preparations of quinine._—Many preparations of quinine are made;\r\nthey are all popularly known as quinine, their uses are similar, and the\r\ndoses are as follows:—\r\n\r\n  Dose, one to five grains, as a tonic.\r\n    ”   five or more grains as a preventive of malaria.\r\n    ”   five to twenty grains, in fevers.\r\n\r\n_Sulphate of quinine._—This is the preparation most commonly used; but\r\nit is very insoluble in water, and should be given along with a little\r\ndilute acid.\r\n\r\n_Acid sulphate of quinine_, sometimes called bisulphate, soluble or\r\nneutral sulphate of quinine.\r\n\r\nThe acid sulphate is much more soluble than the sulphate, and is a more\r\nsuitable preparation for administration by the mouth or for injection\r\ninto the bowel.\r\n\r\n_Hydrochloride of quinine._—Is a very soluble preparation, and contains a\r\nlarge percentage of quinine.\r\n\r\n_Quinine hydrobromide._—Is more soluble than the sulphate, and less\r\nliable to cause headache and other quinine symptoms.\r\n\r\n_Acid quinine hydrobromide._—Very soluble and non-irritating. Solubility,\r\none in six of water.\r\n\r\n_Tannate of quinine._—Is a weak preparation, but suitable for children.\r\nSolubility, one in ten of water.\r\n\r\n_Acid quinine hydrochloride, or quinine bihydrochloride._—Is a very\r\nsoluble preparation, and is suitable for hypodermic injection, but is\r\nsomewhat expensive.\r\n\r\nIt is soluble in less than its own weight of water.\r\n\r\nFor administration by the mouth or bowel, the traveller is advised to\r\ntake either the hydrochloride or the bisulphate of quinine.\r\n\r\nFor intra-muscular administration the acid quinine hydrochloride is\r\ngenerally used.\r\n\r\n_Rhubarb_, either in form of compound rhubarb pill, one of the most\r\nuseful of ordinary aperients, two to four for a dose.\r\n\r\n_Compound Rhubarb Powder_, otherwise known as Gregory’s Powder.\r\n\r\n_Sandal-wood oil._—Uses and doses as for balsam of copaiba.\r\n\r\n_Soda, bicarbonate of._—Dose, five to ten grains or more. Five to\r\nten grains dissolved in water may be given twice a day for acidity,\r\nflatulence, heartburn. Useful in dysentery to allay irritation of\r\nstomach; for this purpose five or ten grains may be given an hour before\r\neach dose of ipecacuanha.\r\n\r\nIf the urine is acid and scalding, give twenty grains three times a day.\r\nBicarbonate of soda is given in cases of blackwater fever when the urine\r\nis not sufficient in quantity; in such cases at least twenty grains\r\nshould be given every six hours.\r\n\r\n_Soda mint tablets_, useful for relieving flatulence, one or two being\r\ntaken after meals.\r\n\r\n_Sodium salicylate._—Dose, ten to twenty grains. Relieves pain in\r\nrheumatic fever. Lowers temperature. Its action must be carefully\r\nwatched, as too large doses may cause headache, buzzing in the ears, and\r\neven delirium.\r\n\r\n_Sulphur._—An ointment containing one part of sulphur to nine of lard,\r\ngrease, or vaseline, makes a useful application for itch and other skin\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\n_Tannin._—Tannin is a powerful astringent, and may be used internally or\r\nexternally.\r\n\r\nIn five to ten grain doses it helps to stop diarrhœa, bleeding from\r\nstomach, bowel, piles, and bladder. If there is continued bleeding,\r\nincrease the dose to twenty grains, and repeat it as often as necessary.\r\n\r\n_Voice tablets_, consisting of chlorate of potash, borax and cocaine are\r\nuseful in cases of sore throat.\r\n\r\n_Warburg’s tincture._—One tablet is equal to thirty drops of the ordinary\r\ntincture. Stronger tablets are also available.\r\n\r\nTo produce sweating, first open the bowels, then give four to eight of\r\nthe tablets with a little hot spirit and water. If necessary, repeat\r\nthe dose in three hours, and in either case withhold if possible food\r\nor drink till after this period has elapsed, but if the patient is very\r\nthirsty give hot drinks of weak tea or spirit and water. Keep him covered\r\nup and put a hot-water bottle in the bed.\r\n\r\nUrgency of the case is a guide as to how many tablets ought to be given.\r\n\r\n_Zinc oxide_ alone or mixed with an equal quantity of boric acid or\r\nstarch makes a useful drying dusting powder.\r\n\r\n_Zinc ointment_ contains three parts of zinc oxide to seventeen parts of\r\nlard or vaseline. This is a most useful application for burns, eczema,\r\nchafes and sores.\r\n\r\n_Sulphate of zinc._—As a prompt emetic, give twenty to thirty grains in\r\nhalf a pint of warm water. If patient does not vomit give a pint or more\r\nof warm water and tickle the back of the throat. A second dose of the\r\ndrug may be given.\r\n\r\nTwo grains to an ounce of water makes a valuable astringent lotion for\r\ngonorrhœa, raw surfaces, ulcers, and inflamed eyes and ears. The strength\r\nof this solution may be gradually increased to six grains to the ounce of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEMPERATURE TAKING, HYPODERMIC INJECTION, BATHS, CATHETERS, STOMACH\r\nTUBES, ENEMAS, AND POULTICES.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pulse, Respiration and Temperature._\r\n\r\nNormal pulse rate (adult) about 72 per minute.\r\n\r\nNormal respiration rate (adult), 15 to 18 per minute.\r\n\r\nNormal temperature, 98.4° F., but varying in health between 97.5° and 99°.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Temperature Taking._\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the body may be taken in the armpit, the mouth, or the\r\nlower part of the bowel.\r\n\r\n_In the Armpit._—Dry armpit well, put the bulb of the thermometer into\r\nit, and press the arm tightly against the body, so that the thermometer\r\nwill be in close contact with the skin on either side for at least five\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n_In the Mouth._—Wash the thermometer in an antiseptic solution, dry it\r\nand place the bulb well under the tongue and close the lips on the stem;\r\nat least three minutes should be allowed. This is a more reliable way of\r\ntaking the temperature than in the armpit.\r\n\r\n_In the Bowel._—If the patient is very ill and light-headed, it is not\r\nadvisable to place the thermometer in the mouth, and when a patient is\r\nhaving a cool bath to reduce his temperature a reading will be needed at\r\nleast every quarter of an hour; in these cases it is best to pass the end\r\nof the thermometer, which has been previously greased, about two inches\r\nup the bowel, and to leave it there for at least two and a half minutes.\r\n\r\nDo not trust in half-minute or minute thermometers, always allow the\r\nfull time given above. Before taking a patient’s temperature see that\r\nthe mercury in the thermometer is shaken down at least as low as 97° F.\r\nAfter the temperature has been taken, note it down carefully, wash the\r\nthermometer, and shake the mercury down to 97° F. If the thermometer is\r\nwashed in hot water, the expanding mercury may break it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hypodermic Injection._\r\n\r\nThe best place to inject is under the skin of the back or chest. The\r\nforearm is usually selected, but there are many objections to it. If the\r\ninjection is made into the leg or arm, the point of the needle should be\r\ndirected towards the body.\r\n\r\n1. Surgical cleanliness must be observed. The hands of the operator and\r\nthe skin of the patient at the spot chosen for injection must be properly\r\ncleaned with an antiseptic lotion, _e.g._, chinosol (1 in 1000) or\r\ncarbolic acid (1 in 60). The site of injection may, as an alternative, be\r\npainted with iodine which, indeed, is the preferable method.\r\n\r\n2. The hypodermic syringe and needle must be perfectly cleaned; if\r\npossible they should be boiled, or an antiseptic lotion, or alcohol\r\n(brandy or whisky) may be syringed through them.\r\n\r\n3. The solution to be injected should be made in a clean, _i.e._, boiled,\r\nspoon, by adding the drug to boiled water.\r\n\r\n4. Draw solution into the syringe, hold the syringe with the needle end\r\npointing upwards, so as to allow any air to rise above the fluid, and\r\npush the piston up till all air has been driven out and the solution\r\nbegins to come through the needle.\r\n\r\n5. Pinch up the skin where the injection is to be made, push the needle\r\nwell through and then under it, keeping the point slightly away from the\r\nskin until the needle is almost entirely covered. The point of the needle\r\nwill now lie in the loose tissue—between the skin and the muscle—into\r\nwhich the fluid is to be injected.\r\n\r\n6. Holding the needle firmly, slowly press the piston until the required\r\namount has been injected; withdraw the needle slowly, keep the finger\r\nover the minute opening in the skin, so as to close it at once, and with\r\nanother finger rub for a few seconds, where the fluid has been injected,\r\nin a direction away from the opening, to assist its absorption.\r\n\r\nAfter giving an injection, wash out the syringe as before, dry needle\r\nwell, and pass a piece of thin wire through it to keep it open. The\r\nneedles are sent out with wire in them to keep the fine channel open;\r\nof course the wire must be removed before the needle is put on to the\r\nsyringe.\r\n\r\nAs strong solutions of permanganate of potash attack the plunger of the\r\npiston, when this drug has been injected, the syringe should be well\r\nwashed with water directly after its use.\r\n\r\n_Hypodermic tablets._—Solutions for injection are best made from tablets\r\nwhich are specially prepared for the purpose. A hypodermic tablet should\r\nbe dissolved in about ten drops of hot water, but as each contains a\r\ndefinite amount of the drug, it does not matter in exactly how much water\r\nthe dose is dissolved. In injecting certain preparations of quinine,\r\nwhich are not easily soluble, so much water may be required that two or\r\nthree separate injections are necessary; there is no objection to this,\r\nthe important thing is to have the quinine really dissolved.\r\n\r\nUsually only medical men should administer hypodermic injections.\r\nFrequently it is not necessary to give a hypodermic injection, for the\r\nhypodermic tablet will be absorbed, and act almost as quickly if placed\r\nunder the tongue.\r\n\r\nThe traveller may be called upon to use one of the following hypodermic\r\ninjections:—\r\n\r\nPermanganate of potassium. _See_ Snake-bite, p. 281.\r\n\r\nMorphia. An injection of a quarter of a grain of morphia may be necessary\r\nwhen there is much pain. The soothing action of opium and chlorodyne is\r\ndue to this substance.\r\n\r\nStrychnine. _See_ Snake-bite, p. 282.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Baths, etc._\r\n\r\n_Cool Bath._—Lift the patient gently in a blanket into a long bath\r\ncontaining water at about 90° F., add water as cold as can be obtained,\r\nkeep the water circulating and running out; one boy must pour water on to\r\nthe head all the time.\r\n\r\nIf a long bath is not at hand, put a blanket over a waterproof sheet, and\r\nlet the patient lie on it; get six or eight boys to hold up the edges,\r\nand give patient his bath in that way.\r\n\r\nA good plan is to dig a shallow trench in the sand and to spread a\r\nwaterproof in it; it is less difficult then to keep the edges of\r\nwaterproof up as the patient is lying in a groove. It is not necessary to\r\nmake the bath really cold if the cool water can be kept running. I have\r\nhardly ever been able, in Africa, to get the water below 80° F.\r\n\r\nNote the bowel temperature, and as soon as it falls to 101° F., remove\r\nthe patient from the bath and put him between warm blankets, and feed\r\nwith some hot soup. If there are any signs of faintness, ammonia, or\r\nequal parts of strong spirit and water, must be given. Weak spirit and\r\nwater has little or no stimulating effect on the heart, therefore, in\r\ncases of fainting, shock, exhaustion, or collapse from any cause, give a\r\nlittle spirit, and give it strong.\r\n\r\n_Wet Pack._—Slip a waterproof under patient, wring a sheet out of cold\r\nwater and pass it under him and wrap him in it, cover with three or four\r\nblankets, and tuck him in. At first he will feel cold and chilly, but\r\nsoon the surface vessels will dilate, and he will begin to feel hot,\r\nand very likely will sweat; keep him in the wet pack with the clothes\r\ncarefully tucked in round the neck, feet and sides for about half an\r\nhour. Then partially dry the patient, and put him into bed between warm\r\nblankets and with hot-water bottles, and give hot drinks to encourage\r\nperspiration.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Catheters._\r\n\r\nAt least six silk-webbed catheters should be taken as part of the\r\nequipment. The most suitable sizes are, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10. They should be\r\npacked in a separate box, and should be kept dry with French chalk or any\r\nother dusting powder.\r\n\r\nBefore use the catheter should lie for at least a quarter of an hour in\r\nan antiseptic solution such as chinosol (1 in 1000), and the solution\r\nshould be frequently syringed through it. The catheter should then be\r\nlubricated with eucalyptus, vaseline, or carbolic oil, or, better, with\r\nboric acid ointment.\r\n\r\nLet the patient lie down, and thoroughly wash the genitals, especially\r\nthe opening of the pipe, with an antiseptic solution, the operator having\r\ncarefully cleaned his own hands. Then pass the catheter gently down the\r\npipe and into the bladder. The silk-web catheters are so flexible that\r\nunless force is used they can do no harm; begin with a No. 8 size, and if\r\nthis cannot be passed, try a No. 4.\r\n\r\nAfter use, wash the catheter as before, dry with a soft handkerchief,\r\nand dust it with powder. On no account should the catheters be greased\r\nwhen they are being put away. Neglect of cleanly precautions in passing\r\ncatheters may lead to inflammation of the bladder and even more serious\r\nmischief.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Stomach Tube._\r\n\r\nThe stomach tube consists of a piece of india-rubber tubing about three\r\nfeet long, with a funnel at one end. The method of passing it is as\r\nfollows:—The patient’s jaws should be kept apart by a gag such as a piece\r\nof stick wrapped in lint placed between the back teeth on either side.\r\nThe left forefinger should be passed into the patient’s mouth as far as\r\npossible and the tongue drawn forward; the rubber tube, oiled or smeared\r\nwith vaseline or glycerine, should then be passed by the side of the\r\nfinger and down the throat for about twenty inches, taking care to use no\r\ngreat force. The funnel is then raised and slowly filled with water; when\r\nall the water has run down, the funnel is lowered and the liquid in the\r\nstomach is drawn out by the syphon action of the tube. The process should\r\nbe repeated till the water returning from the stomach is clear.\r\n\r\nIf the patient is unconscious the tube should not be passed except by a\r\ndoctor.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Enemas._\r\n\r\n_Enema Syringe._—This is fitted with long and short tube. To use the\r\nlong tube, slip it over the short one, which will hold it firmly. After\r\nuse hang it up to drain, dry it well, but do not oil it; carry it loose\r\nrather than coiled up, so as to avoid risk of the rubber kinking at the\r\nflexed portions of the tube.\r\n\r\nTo give an enema, the patient should be placed on his left side, and\r\nbrought close to the edge of the bed, with his knees slightly drawn up\r\ntowards the belly. The pipe or nozzle of the syringe should be well oiled\r\nor smeared with vaseline, and then carefully introduced into the outlet\r\nof the bowel, and passed gently upwards for about three inches, great\r\ncare being taken not to exert any force.\r\n\r\nThe higher up into the bowel a nutrient or medicinal injection is passed,\r\nthe more rapidly will it be absorbed; therefore the long tube is to be\r\npreferred, and the hips should be raised on a pillow, to assist the\r\npatient in retaining the injection.\r\n\r\nA nutrient or medicinal enema is usually small in quantity, about two to\r\nfour ounces, in order to prevent its being rejected by the bowel, and\r\nis administered by means of a small ball syringe provided with a long\r\nnozzle.\r\n\r\nBefore giving a medicinal or nutrient enema, it is best to wash the lower\r\nbowel with warm water, and always see that the mixture to be injected is\r\nwarmed to “blood heat.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Poultices._\r\n\r\n_Linseed-meal poultice._—Mix four ounces of linseed meal into about\r\nhalf a pint of boiling water, constantly stirring until the mixture is\r\nsmooth and even. A piece of tow, teased out to the required size, or a\r\npiece of linen or thin cloth, is placed upon a table, and the poultice\r\nturned out upon it; then spread evenly in a layer about three-quarters of\r\nan inch thick, leaving a margin of tow or linen about an inch wide all\r\nround. This margin should be folded over, and the poultice applied to the\r\naffected part—with the meal next the body.\r\n\r\nAn _Ice poultice_ is made by mixing pounded ice and sawdust, and\r\nenclosing the mixture in a waterproof material such as a mackintosh or\r\ngutta-percha.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF WOUNDS AND INJURIES.\r\n\r\n_By the late WILLIAM HENRY CROSSE, M.D._\r\n\r\nIn treating wounds, whether large or small, the great essential is\r\nabsolute cleanliness, not simple cleanliness in the ordinary acceptance\r\nof the word, but absolute surgical cleanliness.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it is as well to lay down the axiom that all\r\ninflammation and other complications of wounds, as suppuration and\r\nblood-poisoning, are due to germs, and germs alone. All cleansing\r\noperations and antiseptic processes are instituted with the sole idea of\r\npreventing the entrance of germs into the wound, either from the hands of\r\nthe operator, the dressings, instruments, or the skin of the patient.\r\n\r\nAntiseptics are chemical substances which have the power of killing germs\r\noutright, or so checking their growth that the cells in the blood can\r\neasily cope with them. The antiseptics that are mentioned in these notes\r\nare carbolic acid, chinosol, permanganate of potash, and boric acid.\r\n\r\nGiven the antiseptic properties of the substance, it seems a simple\r\nthing, by its application, to prevent germs either entering a wound or\r\nmultiplying there, but in actual practice the germ-free cleanliness of a\r\nwound is a difficult thing to procure. The germs are everywhere—on the\r\ninstruments which cause the wounds, on the skin of the patient, in the\r\nsweat glands of the skin, at the roots of the hairs, and on the hands\r\nof the operator, especially under the nails. Again, a great obstacle to\r\nthe free action of antiseptics is grease or oil of all kinds. A fine\r\ncoating of grease enveloping a germ offers great resistance to the action\r\nof antiseptics, and the object of the process of cleansing a wound\r\ndescribed below is, first, to remove all the grease, and then to apply\r\nthe antiseptic to destroy the germs. With care, a clean-cut wound should\r\nheal kindly, without the formation of matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To clean and dress a Wound._\r\n\r\nFirst cover the wound itself with a small piece of cotton-wool or\r\nlint, wrung out in an antiseptic solution; then thoroughly scrub the\r\nsurrounding skin with warm water and soap (soft soap for preference),\r\nusing a nail brush which has been previously boiled.\r\n\r\nShave the skin in every case, whether thickly covered with hair or not.\r\nThis shaving is most important, as it removes all fine grease-coated\r\nhairs which might favour the growth of germs, and also scrapes off the\r\nsurface dirt and dead scales of skin.\r\n\r\nAfter shaving, again scrub with soap and water, and wash the skin with an\r\nantiseptic lotion, such as carbolic (1 in 60), or chinosol (1 in 1000).\r\n\r\nHaving cleansed the skin, now clean up the wound itself. Thoroughly wash\r\nthe wound with an antiseptic lotion, either rubbed in with lint or wool,\r\nor injected with a _glass_ syringe.\r\n\r\nAll instruments, ligatures and needles should be boiled for at least\r\nfive minutes in water (to which a little washing-soda may be added with\r\nadvantage), and should then be dropped into an antiseptic solution. When\r\nboiling is not possible, they should be soaked in carbolic lotion, 1 in\r\n30, for ten minutes, and then transferred to 1 in 60.\r\n\r\nThe hands of the operator must be scrubbed for some minutes with soap\r\nand warm water, and then in an antiseptic solution, particular attention\r\nbeing paid to the nails, which should have been cut quite short.\r\nCleanliness of the operator’s hands is the first essential of successful\r\ntreatment of wounds.\r\n\r\nThe edges of small, clean-cut wounds may be brought together with\r\nadhesive plaster, but larger wounds will need antiseptic silk or gut\r\nligatures to keep the edges applied evenly.\r\n\r\nLarge ragged wounds, with much bruising; wounds containing dirt, sand,\r\netc., or deep wounds such as those caused by bullets or spears, should\r\nnot be completely closed. They should be cleansed, as above, dusted with\r\niodoform powder, and a strip of antiseptic gauze arranged so as to reach\r\nfrom the surface of the skin to the deepest part of the wound. This,\r\nwhich serves as a drain for the discharges, should be renewed every day\r\nuntil healing is fairly established. If necessary, a few stitches may be\r\ninserted in the more superficial parts of the wound to bring the edges of\r\nthe skin into contact.\r\n\r\nThe wound should be dressed with strips of antiseptic gauze, slightly\r\nmoistened with whichever antiseptic solution is used, and over this\r\nshould be placed a pad of antiseptic wool, which should be kept firmly\r\nand evenly in place by a well-applied bandage.\r\n\r\nA wounded limb should be kept at rest, as far as possible, either by\r\nsand-bags or a splint.\r\n\r\n(In the absence of other antiseptics, the wound, after thorough washing,\r\nmay be dressed with carbolic oil or Friar’s balsam, or boric or iodoform\r\nointment applied on lint.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bleeding or Hæmorrhage._\r\n\r\nGeneral oozing from small vessels may be stopped by means of a pad made\r\nof a piece of antiseptic wool or gauze, firmly bandaged over the bleeding\r\narea.\r\n\r\nWhen a large vessel, whether an artery or a vein, is cut across,\r\nprofuse bleeding will take place, and immediate steps must be taken to\r\nstop this whilst suitable instruments are being obtained. (In bleeding\r\nfrom an artery, the blood spurts out in quick jerking jets; if coming\r\nfrom a vein, the blood flows in a steady continuous stream.) Pressure\r\nshould therefore be applied, by means of the thumb or thumbs, or a\r\ntourniquet,[18] in the course of the vessel, either above or below the\r\ninjury—nearer to the body than the wound if the bleeding is from an\r\nartery (Fig. 3), and beyond the wound if the bleeding is from a vein.\r\n\r\nIt will be found that the bleeding can be controlled more effectually,\r\nand with greater ease, if the vessel is compressed against a neighbouring\r\nbone.\r\n\r\nNo more pressure should be exerted than is just sufficient to stop the\r\nflow of blood.\r\n\r\nWhilst pressure is being applied, the wound should be cleansed with some\r\nantiseptic lotion, and a wedge-shaped pad of antiseptic gauze applied and\r\nfirmly held in position by a bandage.\r\n\r\nBleeding from the hand or forearm can generally be immediately arrested\r\nby forcibly bending up the forearm at the elbow-joint.\r\n\r\nIf these measures effectually control the bleeding, the pressure should\r\nbe kept up for an hour or two, after which time it may be cautiously\r\nrelaxed. If, after the removal of the pressure, the hæmorrhage seems to\r\nhave ceased (as judged by the pad which has been kept in position not\r\ntrickling with blood), apply a large pad of wool _over_ the original\r\ndressing, and bandage this firmly. Dress the wound very carefully on the\r\nthird day.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, in spite of the treatment, the bleeding continues,\r\nthe pressure must be re-applied, and the cut ends of the bleeding vessel\r\nlooked for in the wound itself, and either twisted or tied with a silk\r\nligature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.—METHOD OF COMPRESSING THE MAIN ARTERY OF THE\r\nTHIGH.]\r\n\r\nTo twist a vessel, seize the bleeding point between the blades of the\r\nartery forceps, then, by twisting the instrument round three or four\r\ntimes, the vessel will become blocked or closed, and the forceps may\r\nbe taken off in the course of ten minutes. The other method is to tie\r\nthe vessel with a silk ligature (previously boiled), making a reef or\r\nsailor’s knot, to cut short the ends of the ligature, remove the forceps,\r\nand let the vessel fall back into the wound. In any case cleanse the\r\nwound, and dress in the manner previously described.\r\n\r\nThe traveller who has taken the trouble to learn something about the\r\ntreatment of wounds and severe hæmorrhage will, before his journeys are\r\nended, probably have opportunities of saving the life of a comrade by\r\nhis skill. Nothing can be more distressing than to see a man die from\r\na hæmorrhage which anyone who has studied the subject a little would\r\nbe able to control in nine cases out of ten without much difficulty. I\r\ntherefore earnestly urge all travellers to gain as practical a knowledge\r\nof this subject as is possible, before leaving a civilised country.\r\n\r\n\r\n_After-Treatment of Wounds._\r\n\r\nA clean-cut wound, which has been completely closed and properly dressed,\r\nneed not be dressed again until the fourth day; and the stitches need not\r\nbe removed for seven days.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a ragged or dirty wound, or one in which it has been\r\nnecessary to insert a piece of gauze for the purpose of drainage, should\r\nbe syringed out and dressed daily from the first.\r\n\r\nThe important index to the state of a wound is the patient’s temperature.\r\nIf, on the third day after the wound was first dressed, the temperature\r\nis normal, and subsequently remains so, the wound is probably healing\r\nwell; but if the patient’s temperature is up to or beyond 100° F., and\r\nthe part is painful, there is probably some inflammatory change going on\r\nin the wound. The dressings should be taken off, and the wound examined.\r\nIf the surrounding skin is red and shiny, and the limb swollen and\r\ntender, some of the stitches should be taken out, and the wound well\r\nsyringed with an antiseptic lotion. This, with a good purge, such as\r\ncalomel or Epsom salts, will probably remove all signs of inflammation;\r\nbut still the wound must be dressed daily. If, however, the temperature\r\nstill remains high, 100° to 101° F., or more, and the patient is restless\r\nand light-headed, all the stitches should be taken out, the wound opened\r\nup, and hot fomentations, prepared with an antiseptic lotion, applied\r\nevery four hours till the temperature comes down. Tonics of quinine and\r\niron should be given.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Erysipelas._\r\n\r\nErysipelas is a diffusely-spreading inflammation of the skin, caused\r\nby the presence and activity of germs, which enter through a wounded\r\nsurface. It is most frequently due to want of cleanliness in the\r\ntreatment of wounds. Bright’s disease and gout predispose to this\r\ncomplaint.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._—The disease begins with a vivid red blush, usually starting\r\nfrom a wound, and which has a great tendency to spread or to move from\r\none part of the limb to another. The edge of the blush is sharply\r\ndefined, and slightly raised above the surrounding skin; there is\r\nstiffness and heat in the part, with fever 103°-104° F., not varying\r\nmuch; rapid pulse, headache, loss of appetite, furred tongue and\r\nconstipation.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Isolate the patient and administer a good purgative. Give\r\ntwenty drops of tincture of steel, with five grains of quinine in\r\ntwo ounces of water. Light diet. Stimulants will be necessary. Local\r\ntreatment: flour, starch, or zinc oxide may be used to dust over the\r\npart, or zinc ointment applied on lint. The healthy skin just beyond the\r\nadvancing edge may be painted with tincture of iodine.\r\n\r\n_Cellulitis._—Occasionally the infection of the skin by the germs spreads\r\nto the tissue beneath, and is then called cellulitis, or phlegmonous\r\nerysipelas. In this condition there is more swelling than in simple\r\nerysipelas, and the skin is very boggy or doughy, and retains the imprint\r\nof a finger pressed upon it. The red blush is not so vivid, being darker\r\nand more purple, and there is no well-defined edge. If left untreated,\r\nthe skin will break down and die, causing extensive destruction of the\r\npart.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—General treatment the same as for erysipelas. Locally,\r\nseveral incisions, each at least one inch in length, should be made into\r\nthe swollen tissue where it is most boggy, and right through the skin,\r\ncare being taken to avoid the larger blood-vessels; then hot fomentations\r\nof boric acid (five grains to the ounce) or other antiseptic should be\r\napplied, every two or three hours, till the swelling has subsided. The\r\nimportant point in the treatment of swollen and inflamed parts following\r\nwounds, when accompanied by continued or rising high temperature, is to\r\nrelieve tension by making free incisions. Some knowledge of the anatomy\r\nof the parts is essential before using the knife. In any case, incisions\r\nin the arm or leg should be made parallel to and not across the limb.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Blood-Poisoning._\r\n\r\nIf a poisoned wound is left without thorough local treatment, the poisons\r\nand germs contained in the tissues are taken up by the blood, and cause\r\n_blood-poisoning_. The symptoms of this condition are high temperature,\r\ndelirium, headache, loss of appetite, vomiting, and occasionally\r\nbronchitis and pneumonia. Severe forms of blood-poisoning may lead to the\r\nformation of abscesses all over the body, with fatal result.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—The general treatment is the same as that described for\r\nerysipelas. The local treatment is to thoroughly open up and disinfect\r\nthe poisoned part.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bruises._\r\n\r\nA bruise should be treated by bathing with cold water, or the frequent\r\napplication of wet cloths. The addition of Goulard water, gin, methylated\r\nspirits, eau de cologne, or vinegar, to the water, is beneficial.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sprains._\r\n\r\nThe affected joint should be raised on pillows, and treated in the\r\nmanner advised for bruises, but if seen immediately after the injury,\r\nfirm strapping with adhesive plaster and bandaging of the part is often\r\nequally serviceable. If inflammation develops, warm fomentations will be\r\nfound soothing, leeching may be necessary, and free purgation always has\r\na good effect.\r\n\r\nThe troublesome stiffness which often remains is relieved by friction\r\nand kneading with the hand. To regain the use of the joint, it should be\r\ngently moved each day; this movement is less painful if it is performed\r\nwith the joint in hot water.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Poisoned Wounds from Snakes, Animals, and Arrows, etc._\r\n\r\nIn cases of poisonous snake-bite, the marks of two fangs will usually be\r\nfound.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Tie a piece of tape, bandage, or cord a couple of inches\r\nabove the wound, _i.e._, between the wound and the body; tie another\r\npiece still nearer the body, say three inches from the first. Cut across\r\nthe wound or wounds to encourage free bleeding.\r\n\r\n(If a medical man is present, he may think fit to inject anti-venomous\r\nserum as an antidote to snake poison.)\r\n\r\nDissolve as much permanganate of potash as possible in about a\r\nteaspoonful of water, stirring well to hasten its solution. Inject about\r\nfive drops of this underneath the skin, on either side of the cut, by\r\nmeans of a hypodermic syringe. Some of the solution may be injected into\r\nthe wound itself, or even a crystal of the drug may be pressed into the\r\ncut, or part of a crushed tablet of the drug.\r\n\r\nIt is best to keep a small bottle of the strong solution of permanganate\r\nalways ready.\r\n\r\nGive spirits strong, that is, one tablespoonful to one of water; at least\r\nfour such doses in the first hour. Ammonia may also be given.\r\n\r\nIf the patient is heavy and stupid, give two tablets of strychnine\r\n(one-hundredth of a grain in each) in half a wine-glassful of water, by\r\nthe mouth; or dissolve two in twenty drops of water, and inject well\r\nbeneath the skin into the muscles of the back. If there is no improvement\r\nwithin an hour, give two more tablets; and if necessary, one or two more\r\nin another hour.\r\n\r\nAfter tying up a limb for a poisonous bite, there will be great pain if\r\nthe ligatures have been applied tightly; the parts will swell, become\r\nvery dusky, and if the ligatures are left on too long, the blood supply\r\nwill be cut off, and the parts will die. Therefore, when the ligatures\r\nbegin to cause much pain, loosen the one next the injured part for ten\r\nseconds, then tie again at or near the same place, and loosen the other\r\none for a similar period, and then re-tie; repeat this about every\r\nfifteen minutes. In the course of two hours, both tapes may be taken off.\r\nThe object of tying up is to prevent much of the poison getting into the\r\nsystem at once.\r\n\r\n_The first thing is to tie up tightly; next cut freely, and suck or\r\nsqueeze out as much blood as possible, then treat with drugs._\r\n\r\n(It is usually safe to suck a poisoned wound unless there are any\r\nabrasions or cracks in the mouth, tongue, gums, or lips, taking care\r\nto spit out the poison at once; but the mouth should be washed out\r\nimmediately afterwards with a light purple solution of permanganate of\r\npotash.)\r\n\r\nIf the wounds are on the face, neck, or other spot which cannot be tied\r\nup, then it is best to cut out the part at once and wipe the wound well\r\nwith the strong solution of permanganate.\r\n\r\nIn the treatment of snake-bite, pure carbolic acid, ordinary caustic, a\r\nred-hot wire, or even a burning stick may be applied to the wounds when\r\npermanganate of potash cannot be obtained. In some cases, where no other\r\ntreatment is available, it is advisable to explode a pinch of gun-powder\r\nover the place of injury, or even to blow the parts away with one’s gun.\r\n\r\nIf a finger or toe is bitten by a snake which is certainly poisonous, and\r\nneither drugs nor fire are at hand, it would be best to amputate at once.\r\n\r\nWounds inflicted by poisoned arrows or other weapons, mad dogs, jackals,\r\netc., should be treated in a similar manner to those caused by poisonous\r\nsnakes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Drowning._\r\n\r\nDeath from drowning usually occurs in from two to three minutes after\r\nsubmersion, although people have been revived after a period of five or\r\nsix minutes under water.\r\n\r\nIn treating cases of apparent death from drowning, the points to be aimed\r\nat are:—\r\n\r\nFirst and immediately, the restoration of the breathing.\r\n\r\nSecondly, and _after breathing is restored_, the promotion of warmth and\r\ncirculation.\r\n\r\n1. _To restore the breathing._\r\n\r\nRoll the patient on to his face for a few seconds, placing one of his\r\narms under the forehead; wipe away all weeds, mud, etc., from the mouth.\r\n(In this position water will more easily escape from the mouth, whilst at\r\nthe same time the tongue will fall forward, and leave the entrance to the\r\nwindpipe clear.)\r\n\r\nTurn the patient on his back, on a flat surface, with the head a little\r\nhigher than the feet.\r\n\r\nPlace a small hard pillow (or a rolled-up coat) _under the\r\nshoulder-blades_.\r\n\r\nDraw the patient’s tongue forward, and keep it projecting beyond the lips.\r\n\r\nRemove all tight clothing from about the patient’s neck and chest; also\r\nbraces, belt, etc.\r\n\r\nKneel at the patient’s head, grasp his arms just above the elbows, draw\r\nthem gently and steadily upwards above his head, and keep them stretched\r\nin that position for two seconds (Fig. 4). (By this means air is drawn\r\ninto the lungs.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\nReverse the movement, and press the patient’s arms gently but firmly\r\nagainst the sides of the chest, keeping them in this position for two\r\nseconds (Fig. 5). (By this means air is pressed out of the lungs.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.]\r\n\r\nRepeat these movements alternately and regularly, about fifteen times a\r\nminute, until natural breathing takes place, or as long as there is any\r\nhope of saving the patient. It may be necessary to continue the movements\r\nfor as long as an hour.\r\n\r\nWhile these movements are being carried out the wet clothing may be\r\nremoved, the body gently dried, and the patient wrapped up in dry\r\nblankets.\r\n\r\n2. _To promote warmth and circulation._\r\n\r\nRub the limbs and body vigorously with dry towels and flannels, always\r\nrubbing from the extremities towards the heart.\r\n\r\nApply hot-water bottles, hot flannels, or hot bricks to the feet,\r\narmpits, the pit of the stomach, and between the thighs.\r\n\r\nImmediately the power of swallowing returns, administer hot coffee,\r\nspirits and warm water, etc.\r\n\r\nPut the patient to bed between hot blankets as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fractures._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.—DIAGRAM OF THE HUMAN SKELETON, GIVING THE NAMES\r\nAND POSITIONS OF THE CHIEF BONES.]\r\n\r\nA _simple fracture_ is one in which, though the bone or bones are broken,\r\nthe protecting skin is _not_ broken.\r\n\r\nA _compound fracture_ is one in which the skin, etc., is broken or cut\r\nacross, so that the fracture is more or less exposed to the air. The end\r\nof either fragment of the broken bone may protrude through the skin.\r\n\r\nA _comminuted fracture_ is one in which the bone is broken into several\r\npieces; such a fracture may be either simple or compound.\r\n\r\nIn a simple fracture great gentleness should be used in handling the\r\nparts, so as not to convert it into a compound fracture; therefore, do\r\nnot undress the part; rather cut away the clothing.\r\n\r\nA fracture which is compound is usually serious, for dirt and germs are\r\nliable to be carried into the wound and cause great mischief; in gunshot\r\nwounds, dirt or pieces of clothing may be carried into the wound.\r\n\r\nThe signs of a fracture are, firstly, the patient’s own feelings, _e.g._,\r\nthe pain which is caused on handling the part, sudden loss of power, and\r\nthe sensation of grating. Secondly, on examination, most if not all of\r\nthe following signs will be observed: inability of patient to move the\r\npart below the injury, swelling, unnatural movement below the site of\r\nfracture, alteration in appearance of the limb.\r\n\r\nIn fractures of the upper or lower limb there is usually shortening, the\r\nspasmodic action of the muscles causing the broken ends to ride over each\r\nother, and the greater the obliquity of the line of fracture the greater\r\nwill be the shortening and alteration in appearance.\r\n\r\nA sensation of grating is usually conveyed to the operator when he\r\nattempts to move the parts; sometimes this grating can be heard, as well\r\nas felt. Comparison of the injured with the sound limb is of the greatest\r\nimportance in detecting fractures.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Treatment of Simple Fractures._\r\n\r\nDirectly a fracture of a limb is made out, a splint or splints of\r\nsome kind should be applied to keep the parts fairly in position, and\r\nto prevent a broken end from being pushed through the skin. Cloths\r\nand bandages may be applied firmly round the injured part, and then\r\nextemporised splints, such as boards, straight sticks, umbrellas, or\r\nbayonets, should be applied and kept in position till the patient is in\r\nbed.\r\n\r\nSplints suitable to the injury should be now made and well covered with\r\nwool, lint, or cloth, special care being taken to pad them well where\r\nthey are likely to press upon bony prominences, such as the inner or\r\nouter ankle. The limb must next be straightened, and any deformity caused\r\nby overriding of the fragments must be remedied by steady pulling upon\r\nthe parts above and below the fracture, in opposite directions, and the\r\nparts brought into good position by manipulating the bones at the seat\r\nof fracture. The prepared splints, extending well below and above the\r\nfracture, are then fitted to the limb with cotton-wool or lint, and\r\nsecured by bandages.\r\n\r\nIf there is great swelling and tenderness of a limb, then it is advisable\r\nnot to apply splints at once. Sand pillows should be made, or stockings\r\nnearly filled with sand and their mouths tied, and applied one on either\r\nside of the limb, to keep it absolutely still; the painful swelling may\r\nbe reduced by applying ice or evaporating lotions. When the swelling is\r\nsomewhat reduced, splints may be applied after proper manipulation.\r\n\r\nWhilst the bandages should be firmly applied so as to keep the splints\r\nin position, they must not be bound too tightly, otherwise swelling and\r\nulceration may be caused. If there is much pain and swelling after a\r\nfracture has been set, it will be necessary to loosen the bandages.\r\n\r\nUnion of the fractured bones is generally completed in about six weeks.\r\n\r\n_Collar-bones._—Fracture of the collar-bone should be treated by placing\r\na large wedge-shaped pad (about six inches long, by three in thickness at\r\nthe upper end) in the armpit, and securing it with tapes tied over the\r\nopposite shoulder. The elbow should then be brought forward, and raised\r\nand well supported by a broad triangular bandage or handkerchief, used as\r\na sling, and with the ends tied over the opposite shoulder. A flannel or\r\nother bandage should then be wound round the chest, so as to secure the\r\narm from accidental movements.\r\n\r\n_Ribs._—Fracture of the ribs may be treated by wrapping a flannel\r\nbandage round the chest pretty tightly, so as to limit the movements\r\nof breathing, which are very painful. The flannel should be secured by\r\nstitching, and the upper turns should be fixed by broad tapes passed\r\nover the shoulders and firmly stitched. Firm strapping of the side with\r\nadhesive plaster is still better. For this purpose about six strips\r\nof plaster one to two inches wide and eighteen inches long should be\r\napplied evenly round the side of the chest; each piece should be overlaid\r\nby the next piece above it for about half an inch. To secure rest for\r\nthe affected side of the chest, the strapping should not only cover the\r\nbroken bone, but should extend to about three inches above and below it,\r\nand should reach well beyond the middle line both in front and behind.\r\n\r\n_Upper Arm._—Fracture of the upper arm may be treated by the application\r\nof several narrow splints reaching from the armpit to the elbow, well\r\npadded, and supported in position by a bandage carried from the fingers\r\nto the armpit. Care must be taken that the splints on the inner side do\r\nnot chafe the folds of the armpit. The hand and wrist should then be\r\nsupported in a sling, but the elbow must be allowed to hang free.\r\n\r\n_Forearm._—Fractures of the forearm must be treated by two splints,\r\neach wider than the limb. The injured limb is allowed to hang down by\r\nthe side, palm forwards. One splint reaching from the elbow to the\r\nfinger-tips is applied to the back of the limb; the other is placed on\r\nthe front, and only reaches from the bend of the elbow to the level of\r\nthe ball of the thumb. The splints are secured temporarily by a couple\r\nof slip knots. Now bend the arm to a right angle, thumb uppermost, and\r\nbandage securely from the tips of the fingers up to the elbow.\r\n\r\n_Thigh._—Fractures of the thigh are serious; they require the patient to\r\nbe kept in bed till union has been effected, and they are more likely to\r\nlead to shortening and permanent lameness if not very carefully treated,\r\nand the assistance of a skilled surgeon is urgently needed. A long splint\r\nis applied to the outside of the limb, reaching from the armpit to beyond\r\nthe foot, and secured above by a bandage passing round the body, whilst\r\nthe foot and leg are firmly bandaged to it below.\r\n\r\n_Leg._—Fractures of the leg should be treated by applying a splint on\r\neach side, long enough to reach from the knee to a little below the sole\r\nof the foot. They should be carefully applied with bandages, keeping\r\nthe great toe in a line with the inner border of the knee-cap. When the\r\naccident occurs in the open air, the injured limb should be tied to the\r\nsound one, till the patient is brought to a place of security, the toes\r\nbeing prevented from pointing inwards.\r\n\r\n_Lower Jaw._—Manipulate the parts into their normal position and mould\r\na splint of gutta percha, or other material, as accurately as possible\r\nto the lower jaw. If a tooth is loose and prevents the two jaws meeting\r\nproperly it should be taken out.\r\n\r\nApply the splint and keep it in position by a bandage, which should be\r\nsplit at the chin so as to encircle the point of the jaw; the ends of\r\nthe bandage are also split as far forward as the angle of the jaw; two\r\nends are tied behind the neck and two over the top of the head, as in the\r\ndiagram, and these tied ends should be united by a bandage or tapes to\r\nkeep them in position (Fig. 8).\r\n\r\nIn the absence of suitable material for making a splint, this bandage\r\nalone will have to suffice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.\r\n\r\nFIG. 8.]\r\n\r\nThe patient must be fed on slops through a tube passed behind the teeth,\r\nor through a passage resulting from the loss of a tooth.\r\n\r\n_Compound Fractures._—Clean up thoroughly as described in the treatment\r\nof wounds. Wash out with an antiseptic solution, dust with iodoform,\r\napply an antiseptic pad. Set the limb in such a manner that the wound can\r\nbe dressed daily without interfering with the splints.\r\n\r\nIf the bone is protruding through the wound, it must, if possible, be got\r\nback into position. If this cannot be done it may be necessary to saw off\r\nthe end of the bone to enable the wound to be closed.\r\n\r\nIf the wound is large, deep, or dirty, it should be stuffed with\r\nantiseptic gauze so that free drainage may be allowed, and the gauze\r\nshould be changed each day.\r\n\r\n_After-treatment of Fractures._—Gentle movements may be cautiously\r\nbegun, in the joints above and below the injury, in about three weeks.\r\nWhile these are being carried out, the limb must be firmly supported to\r\navoid interfering with the healing processes going on between the ends of\r\nthe bones.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dislocations._\r\n\r\nDislocations nearly always require skilled aid to reduce them.\r\n\r\n_Shoulder-joint._—Patient cannot raise the arm to his head or perform any\r\nother shoulder movements freely. The shoulder is flattened, the elbow\r\nsticks out, and the limb is usually lengthened.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—The patient should lie down. The operator removes his own\r\nboot on the same side as that of the patient’s dislocation, inserts his\r\nheel into the patient’s armpit and draws the arm steadily down, at the\r\nsame time pressing the heel in an outward direction; the dislocated\r\nbone should slip back into its proper position. Put a pad in the armpit\r\nand bandage the arm to the side for a week; support arm in a sling for\r\nanother week or two.\r\n\r\n_Elbow-joint._—Dislocation of the bones of the forearm backwards at the\r\nelbow-joint is fairly common.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—This dislocation can usually be reduced by placing the\r\nknee in front of the patient’s elbow, and making firm traction on the\r\nforearm—which is at the same time bent a little around the operator’s\r\nknee. The patient can be kept sitting in a chair while this is done, and\r\nthe operator can get his knee into the required position by placing his\r\nfoot on the side of the chair.\r\n\r\n_Hip-joint._—Is the most common form of dislocation. The limb is\r\nshortened, bent at the knee and twisted inwards, the great toe of the\r\ninjured limb resting on the instep of foot of the opposite limb. The\r\nouter side of the hip is swollen and distorted.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Grasp the ankle with one hand and the knee with the other.\r\nLift up the leg and bend it at the hip, then carry it as a whole away\r\nfrom the other limb as far as possible, rotate the toes and foot firmly\r\noutwards, and in that position bring the limb back parallel to the sound\r\none.\r\n\r\n_After-treatment of Dislocations._—After dislocations, gentle movement of\r\nthe joints should be begun in two weeks, so as to prevent them becoming\r\nfixed.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOISONS.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible, in the small space available, to give anything like a\r\ndetailed scheme of the treatment of the various poisons, but a few hints\r\non the essential points must not be omitted.\r\n\r\nI have therefore arranged a list of the commoner poisons, together with\r\nthe special treatment appropriate to each. Following this are a few hints\r\nmore especially adapted to the requirements of travellers.\r\n\r\nPoison should be suspected (_a_) when severe and alarming symptoms of\r\nillness suddenly attack a person apparently in good health; (_b_) if the\r\nsymptoms closely follow the taking of food, drink, or medicines; (_c_)\r\nif several people are attacked after having partaken of the same food or\r\ndrink.\r\n\r\nThe points to be attended to in the treatment of cases of poisoning are:—\r\n\r\n_a._ Remove as much of the poison as possible from the stomach. To do\r\nthis, it is usual to give an emetic, such as mustard and water, or zinc\r\nsulphate, thirty grains; or to pass the soft rubber tube down the gullet,\r\nand wash out the stomach with water.\r\n\r\n_b._ Counteract the effect of the poison by an antidote.\r\n\r\n_c._ Keep up the patient’s strength till the poison is removed from the\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n_d._ Relieve pain.\r\n\r\nTravellers may be poisoned in the following ways:—\r\n\r\n1. By poisonous bites, arrow wounds, etc.\r\n\r\n2. By eating food poisoned by natives.\r\n\r\n3. By eating poisonous plants, etc.\r\n\r\n4. By eating bad meat or fish.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of _snake-bites and arrow wounds_ has already been dealt\r\nwith.\r\n\r\n_Poisoned food and poisonous plants._—Food is occasionally poisoned by\r\nnatives, either by adding strophanthus leaves or other poisons. The\r\neating of such articles may be followed by severe pain, colic, vomiting,\r\ndiarrhœa or other symptoms. The general line of treatment should consist\r\nin giving emetics promptly, washing out the stomach by means of the\r\nstomach tube, and administering large quantities of water, milk, or\r\ngruel. Distressing symptoms should be treated as they arise; thus, if\r\nconvulsions occur, large doses of chloral or potassium bromide should be\r\ngiven; if stupor or drowsiness comes on, the patient should be forced to\r\ntake hot coffee, stimulants, etc., and made to walk about. If collapse\r\nsupervenes, stimulants should be freely given, the patient wrapped in\r\nblankets, and hot bottles applied to the feet.\r\n\r\n_Poisoning by bad meat, fish, etc._—The symptoms of poisoning by bad\r\nmeat, etc., are severe pains in the belly, cramps, and shivering fits,\r\nfollowed by vomiting and diarrhœa coming on soon after its consumption,\r\noccasionally within an hour or two. The vomiting and diarrhœa are usually\r\nalarming and very severe, causing great collapse, and unless urgent\r\nremedies are applied, death may occur. The bodies of patients may be\r\ncovered all over with irritating blotches, red rashes or with nettle rash.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Give an emetic at once. Administer a sharp purge to clear\r\nout the bowels. Use stimulants freely. Apply hot-water bottles and\r\nblankets. Give opium or chlorodyne, fifteen drops every four hours until\r\nthe pain is relieved. Milk and gruel or arrowroot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANOEING AND BOATING.\r\n\r\n_By J. COLES._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Canoeing._\r\n\r\n_Choice of a Canoe._—In making choice of a canoe the traveller must bear\r\nin mind that, in all probability, there will be rapids in the river,\r\nwhich will necessitate a portage being made, and that the canoe may have\r\nto be carried over rough ground for a considerable distance. For this\r\nreason, it is far better to take two canoes of moderate size than one\r\nlarge one, besides which, a small canoe is much more easily handled in\r\nbad water, and even should it become necessary to carry a large load,\r\nthis can easily be done by lashing two small canoes together, at about\r\none yard apart, and laying a platform across them, on which to place the\r\nstores, &c. This, however, should not be done in dangerous and rapid\r\nrivers. The following remarks do not, therefore, apply to large canoes,\r\nwhich, having nearly the stability of a boat, may be handled in the same\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n_Paddles._—It will generally be found that the native paddles will be\r\nbest suited for the work. The double-bladed paddle, such as is used with\r\nthe Rob Roy canoe, is quite useless on a rapid and dangerous river.\r\n\r\n_Sail._—The sail should be made of duck, or some such light material,\r\nfastened to a light yard at each end, and its hoist should be about\r\ntwice its breadth; its size must be in proportion to the canoe, the\r\nhoist being about one-fourth of the canoe’s length. The mast should be\r\nas light as possible, with a hole at the top for the halliards to pass\r\nthrough freely. The end should be stepped in a chock in the bottom of\r\nthe canoe (when in use), and it should be lashed to one of the stays, or\r\ncross-pieces of the canoe. The sail should never be used unless the wind\r\nis steady and abaft the beam, and the halliards should be taken to the\r\nafter part of the canoe in order to stay the mast, and secured in such a\r\nmanner that it can be instantly let go, when the sail will at once fall,\r\nand undue pressure on the canoe relieved.\r\n\r\n_The Tow-line._—Too much attention cannot be paid to this important\r\narticle. It should be light, but of the best material (such as the rope\r\nused by the Alpine Club), as its giving way at a critical moment in a\r\nrapid is sure to be attended with most serious results.\r\n\r\n_Loading the Canoe._—The packages should not exceed 50 lbs. in weight, as\r\nthey may have to be carried long distances over portages, and care must\r\nbe taken not to overload the canoe. Natives, who are all good swimmers,\r\nand have nothing to lose by a capsize, are very apt to put more into a\r\ncanoe than is safe, so that it is a matter in which the traveller should\r\nuse his own discretion.\r\n\r\nIn ascending a rapid river, keep close to one of its banks, and endeavour\r\nto take advantage of eddies. It will often happen that, owing to the\r\nstrength of the stream, no headway can be made with the paddles, in\r\nwhich case recourse must be had to poling or tracking. In the event of\r\nthe former, the poles should be straight and tough, and as long as can\r\nbe conveniently carried in the canoe. Natives generally stand up to\r\npole, but this the traveller should not attempt to do, or he will in\r\nall probability either fall overboard, or capsize the canoe, or both.\r\nIn tracking, as great a length of line as possible should be used, as a\r\nsheer of the canoe in a rapid, with a short line, will often end in a\r\ncapsize. Only two men should remain in the canoe, one in the bow with a\r\npole, and the other in the stern with a paddle to steer; this man should\r\nalso have his pole handy. The line should be made fast to one of the\r\nstays in the bow of the canoe, and _never to a towing mast_, as in a\r\nboat; as in passing round bad corners, or places where there are snags,\r\nand where it is necessary to give the canoe a wide sheer, the leverage\r\nof the mast, if the line were fastened to the top of it, would pull the\r\ncanoe over. The man in the bow, however, should always have his knife\r\nhandy to cut the tow-line, should necessity arise for his doing so. In\r\ntracking, when a river passes through sandy soil, the men on the line\r\nshould keep at some little distance from the edge of the bank, as it is\r\nlikely to give way under their weight, and precipitate them into the\r\nriver. Several men lost their lives in Fraser River, in the early days of\r\nthe gold discovery, by neglecting this precaution.\r\n\r\nIn crossing from one bank of a river to the other above a rapid, be\r\ncareful to ascend the river for a considerable distance before attempting\r\nto do so; and then make the crew paddle as hard as they can, keeping the\r\nhead of the canoe, if anything, rather down the stream, as in the case of\r\na rapid river you would only lose ground by trying to fight against it.\r\n\r\nIn descending a river, the traveller should keep a look-out ahead for\r\nsnags and places where the river is narrowed in between hills, as in\r\nsuch places there is nearly sure to be a rapid which may be so bad as to\r\nrender navigation impossible. In all cases before descending an unknown\r\nrapid, he should land and inspect it throughout _its entire length_\r\nbefore attempting to run it in the canoe. When descending a rapid, care\r\nmust be taken to keep steerage way on the canoe, as this will be needed\r\nto avoid rocks, or whirlpools. These latter are very serious dangers, as\r\nthey generally do not remain fixed in one spot, but move about within a\r\ncertain distance of a centre. There are, however, in most cases, short\r\nintervals when they break up, and that is the time to make a dash past\r\nthem. To attempt this when they are in full swing could only end in the\r\nloss of the canoe and its occupants.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boating._\r\n\r\nWhen a traveller has to proceed for some distance overland before\r\nreaching a river or lake he purposes to navigate, he must of necessity\r\nprovide himself with a boat constructed in such a manner as to be easily\r\ntransported, either by being built in sections, that can be put together\r\nand taken to pieces at pleasure, or by taking one of the collapsible\r\nboats, such as Berthon’s. If the former, he cannot do better than to\r\nhave one built of Spanish cedar, on the same plan as that which was\r\nconstructed for Sir H. M. Stanley, by Mr. James Messenger, of Teddington,\r\nwith such modifications as may be necessary, when the means of transport,\r\nand the nature of his journey, have been duly considered. Collapsible\r\nboats, though very useful for ferrying across lakes or rivers, cannot,\r\nwhere a boat of other construction is available, be recommended for a\r\ncontinued exploration.\r\n\r\nIf the exploration is to be commenced at the mouth of the river, a\r\nwhale-boat will be found to be the best form of boat for the following\r\nreasons. Being steered by an oar, it is more easily handled in surf or\r\na rapid; it is generally faster than boats of the same size of ordinary\r\nbuild; it will carry a good cargo, sail well off the wind, and is the\r\nbest boat built for crossing the bars of rivers, or landing through a\r\nsurf. Such a boat can generally be purchased at foreign ports, with oars\r\nand sail, and should be well overhauled before starting.\r\n\r\nBoat-sailing cannot be taught by any book, and certainly not by a few\r\nshort notes of this description. The traveller, therefore, who intends\r\nusing a boat for exploration, should gather some experience before\r\nstarting, which can be done at any fishing village on the coast. This\r\nwill be the more necessary if he intends to use his boat on a lake, or\r\nfor sailing along the coast, from the mouth of one river to another, and\r\nthe following hints may, it is hoped, be useful to those who have had but\r\nsmall experience in boat-sailing.\r\n\r\n_When under sail_, never, _under any circumstances_, allow the sheet to\r\nbe made fast; a turn should be taken round a cleat, and it should be\r\nheld by one of the crew ready to let go at any moment. Do not let the\r\ncrew stand up, or sit on the gunwale. When about to round-to, remember\r\nthat you cannot carry the same canvas on a wind that you can before it.\r\nIf caught in a squall, put down the helm at once, ease the sheet, and if\r\nthe squall is a bad one, lower the sail while it is still shaking. When\r\napproaching a danger, such as a rock, do not stand on if you are in doubt\r\nabout weathering it, but go about in time, and have an oar ready to help\r\nthe boat round if she appears likely to miss stays. Never carry too much\r\nsail, as there is considerable danger in doing so, and a boat will often\r\nsail faster with a reef taken in, than she will when unduly pressed. If\r\nnecessary to take in a reef when sailing _on a wind_, do not luff, but\r\ncheck the sheet, lower the sail sufficiently to shift the tack, gather\r\nthe sheet aft so that the men may take in the reef without leaning over\r\nthe gunwale, shift the sheet, hoist the sail, while the sheet is slack,\r\nand do not haul the sheet aft until the men are again in their places.\r\n\r\n_Rowing._—This can only be acquired by practice, and though the traveller\r\nwill seldom be called on to take an oar himself, circumstances may\r\narise when he may have to do so, and we would, therefore, advise him\r\nto learn how to handle an oar before leaving England. Under ordinary\r\ncircumstances, rowing on a river is sufficiently simple, and calls for\r\nno special instructions. The case, however, is very different when a\r\nriver bar has to be crossed, or a landing made on a beach where a surf is\r\nbreaking, and in either case it will be well to remember the following\r\nhints. On approaching the shore, a surf when seen from seaward never\r\nlooks so bad as it really is. Where possible, a landing should not be\r\nattempted until opposite a village where the natives will be ready to\r\nassist the moment the boat touches the beach. When the surf is heavy,\r\nthe boat should be backed in, pulling a few strokes to meet each heavy\r\nsea, and then backing in again until the shore is reached. The great\r\nthing to avoid is, letting the boat get broadside to the sea, as she will\r\nthen capsize; a steer-oar should always be used, as a rudder is of little\r\nuse in a surf, when backing in.\r\n\r\n_In crossing a bar_, if there is a good, strong, fair wind, it will\r\ngenerally be best to cross under sail; but if the wind is light or\r\nvariable, this should never be attempted. When rowing, the crew should be\r\ncautioned to keep their oars out of the water when the sea breaks round\r\nthe boat, and to commence rowing again as quickly as possible afterwards.\r\nAs even in the most experienced hands a boat will often be swamped on a\r\nbad bar, it will be well, before attempting to cross it, to prepare for a\r\nswim by removing all superfluous clothing, and see that everything that\r\nwill float in the boat should be left free to float, while things that\r\nwill sink, such as fire-arms, &c., should be securely fastened to the\r\nthwarts.\r\n\r\nThe remarks given on canoeing with regard to loading, to ascending and\r\ndescending rapid rivers, are equally applicable to boating under similar\r\ncircumstances, with the following exceptions. In towing, a short mast\r\nshould be used to which the line is made fast; this is stepped in the\r\nsame place as the mast, and should be stayed, so as to resist the strain\r\nof the tow-line. Paddles will often be found useful in reedy rivers\r\nwhere the oars get entangled. As a whale-boat empty will weigh about\r\nfive hundredweight, more care must be taken at portages than in the\r\ncase of a canoe, which can be lifted bodily over obstacles. The stems\r\nof small trees, or the oars should be laid down under the boat, and,\r\nwhere possible, sharp rocks must be avoided or moved out of the way. In\r\na rapid, two men should be in the bow with poles ready to fend off from\r\nrocks, and the most experienced man of the crew should be in the stern\r\nwith the steer-oar.\r\n\r\nAlthough in the foregoing remarks special reference has been made to\r\nwhale-boats, the hints given are equally applicable to boats of other\r\nconstruction, which should, however, for river work, crossing a bar, or\r\nlanding through a surf, be fitted with a steer-oar in addition to the\r\nrudder. Awnings should be taken, but in rapid rivers, and when under\r\nsail, they cannot be used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORTHOGRAPHY OF GEOGRAPHICAL NAMES.\r\n\r\n_By MAJ.-GEN. LORD EDWARD GLEICHEN, K.C.V.O., C.B., C.M.G., D.S.O.\r\nChairman of the Permanent Committee on Geographical Names._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1878 the Council of the R.G.S., impressed with the necessity of\r\nendeavouring to reduce the confusion existing in British maps with regard\r\nto the spelling of geographical names, in consequence of the variety of\r\nsystems of orthography used by travellers and others to represent the\r\nsound of native place-names in different parts of the world, formally\r\nadopted the general principle which had been long used by many, and\r\nthe recognition of which had been steadily gaining ground, viz., that\r\nin writing geographical native names vowels should have their Italian\r\nsignificance, and consonants that which they have in the English language.\r\n\r\nThis broad principle required elucidation in its details, and a\r\nsystem based upon it was consequently drawn up with the intention of\r\nrepresenting the principal syllabic sounds: this has long been known as\r\nthe R.G.S. system.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe system thus drawn up was largely adopted by the War Office, the\r\nAdmiralty, and other Government Departments and private societies. But it\r\nwas never officially sanctioned, for India, China,[19] Egypt, and many\r\nof our Colonies had already their own system (or want of system) for\r\nspelling foreign words; added to this, the private firms of map-makers\r\nhad their own views on the subject, and still spelt their names in a\r\nbewildering variety of ways.\r\n\r\nThe matter came to a head in 1919, when the Admiralty approached the\r\nRoyal Geographical Society with a request for the authoritative spelling\r\nof names. A committee was accordingly formed, with representatives from\r\nall Government Departments, each of which bound itself to adopt the\r\nspelling recommended.\r\n\r\nThis “Permanent Committee on Geographical Names,” under the chairmanship\r\nof a Member of Council, R.G.S., at once got to work and proceeded to draw\r\nup:\r\n\r\n1. A revised system of Rules and Alphabet, termed the R.G.S. II system,\r\namplifying and improving on the old R.G.S. system of 1878. (This is given\r\nin the succeeding pages.)\r\n\r\n2. Lists of doubtful names, with their correct spelling and other\r\ndetails concerned. (These will be published periodically, in the form of\r\nleaflets, in the ‘Geographical Journal.’)\r\n\r\n3. Tables of Foreign Alphabets transcribed into the R.G.S. II system.\r\n(These will be published shortly in the R.G.S. Technical Series.)\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that the above procedure will gradually result in the correct\r\nand uniform spelling of foreign Place-Names throughout the Empire.\r\n\r\nIt must also be noted that the Government of the United States of\r\nAmerica, after an exhaustive enquiry, has adopted a system in close\r\nconformity with that of the R.G.S., and has directed that the spelling\r\nof all names in their vast territories should, in cases where the\r\northography is at present doubtful, be settled authoritatively by a Board\r\nappointed for the purpose. The two great English-speaking nations are\r\nthus working in harmony.\r\n\r\n\r\nRULES FOR THE SPELLING OF GEOGRAPHICAL NAMES FOR BRITISH OFFICIAL USE.\r\n\r\n(_Termed the R.G.S. II system._)\r\n\r\n1. The spelling of every place-name in an independent country or\r\nself-governing dominion using the Latin alphabet[20] shall be that\r\nadopted by the country or dominion, except in the case in which certain\r\nimportant localities have also, in addition to the official name, another\r\ncustomary name, notably different, in which case the name customary in\r\nBritish use (_i.e._, “conventional”) may be adopted (_e.g._, Geneva,\r\nWarsaw, etc., for Genève, Warszawa, etc.).\r\n\r\n2. The spelling of such place-names in colonial possessions as belong to\r\nlanguages coming under Rule (1) will be spelt in accordance with that\r\nrule.\r\n\r\n3. The accents and diacritical marks in official use by the above\r\ncountries will be retained. Wherever it appears desirable, the\r\npronunciation will be shown by giving the name as transliterated on the\r\nsystem below.\r\n\r\n4. All other place-names throughout the world will (with the exception of\r\n“Conventional” names and some others) be spelled in general accordance\r\nwith the following system, which is based upon, and differs only slightly\r\nfrom, the system long used by the Royal Geographical Society, from which\r\nare derived the War Office system, 1906,[21] and the system of the\r\nIntelligence Division, Naval Staff, 1917.[22]\r\n\r\nThe broad features of this system are—\r\n\r\n    (_a_) That vowels are pronounced as in Italian and consonants\r\n    as in English;\r\n\r\n    (_b_) That every letter is pronounced, and no redundant letters\r\n    are used.\r\n\r\nThe system aims at giving a close approximation to the _local_\r\npronunciation; but it is recognised that in some languages, notably\r\nRussian, Greek, and Arabic, the necessity for letter-for-letter\r\ntransliteration often renders this impossible.\r\n\r\n  TABLE OF SPELLING AND PRONUNCIATION R.G.S.

The apostrophe\r\n’ in foreign words indicates a liquid sound. (See below.)\r\n\r\n_Liquid Sounds._—The occasional “liquid” or “palatalised” sound of _d_,\r\n_l_, _n_, _r_, _t_, etc. (as in _d’you_, _lure_, _new_, _clarion_,\r\n_tune_), is as a rule sufficiently represented by a following _y_; where,\r\nhowever, owing to a following consonant, or to the letter in question\r\ncoming at the end of a word, the _y_ is inapplicable, the liquid sound\r\nwill be represented by an apostrophe, thus: _d’_, _l’_, _n’_, _r’_, _t’_,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n_The “Neutral Vowel”._—The “indeterminate” or “neutral” vowel sound\r\n(_er_), i.e. the sound of _a_ in _marine_, _e_ in _often_, _i_ in\r\n_stir_, _io_ in _nation_, _o_ in _connect_, _ou_ in _curious_, _u_ in\r\n_difficult_, etc., _e_ in French _je_, or the often unwritten vowel (َ\r\n_Fat-ha_) in Arabic, etc., is represented as a rule by _a_: as in Basra,\r\nHawiya; but sometimes by _e_, when the sound approximates more to _e_\r\nthan to _a_: as Meshed, El Gezira.\r\n\r\n(In any guide to pronunciation issued by the Permanent Committee on\r\nGeographical Names, the “neutral vowel” is represented generally by the\r\nitalic _e_: occasionally also by italic _a_ or _u_.)\r\n\r\nThis sound must not be confused with _e-mute_, where the _e_ is not\r\nsounded at all: as in Abbeville.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE GIVING OF NAMES TO NEWLY-DISCOVERED PLACES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Council of the Royal Geographical Society would urge upon all\r\ntravellers that in giving names to any new discoveries which they may\r\nmake they should be guided by the following restrictions, which, until\r\ncomparatively recent years, were commonly observed:—\r\n\r\n    1. That before putting forward any personal or fanciful name\r\n    the traveller should do his best to ascertain that no local\r\n    name exists, and where none is forthcoming should further\r\n    consider whether one might not conveniently be derived from\r\n    the vicinity, _e.g._, from an adjacent stream, or pasture, or\r\n    glacier, or from some characteristic of the natural object\r\n    itself.\r\n\r\n    2. That no one should commemorate himself in this manner.\r\n\r\n    3. That any new nomenclature which a traveller may desire to\r\n    suggest should be put forward tentatively and subject to the\r\n    approval (1) of the Administration of the region or country, if\r\n    there is one; (2) of the Official Cartographer of the country,\r\n    if it possesses a Survey Department, or of the State to which\r\n    the region may belong; or (3) of the Council of the Royal\r\n    Geographical Society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Equivalents obtained by Mr. R.

Washing with a very weak solution of corrosive sublimate is an\r\nefficient plan. A large number of labels, with the collector’s name\r\nprinted on them, may be taken, and if made of strong thin paper they\r\nwill not occupy much space. Bank-note paper is well adapted for the\r\npurpose. Any writing should be, if possible, in ink; if not, a very hard\r\nblack pencil should be used. Some tie labels should be added, as paper\r\ncoverings soon run short.\r\n\r\n[4] There are plenty of good works on the use of the blow-pipe.

The problem\r\nis complicated by the fact that the upper end of the main valley is\r\nfrequently a ‘hanging’ valley. Any evidence bearing on the formation of\r\nthese ‘hanging’ valleys should be carefully noted.\r\n\r\n[7] Travellers who intend to make collections of zoological specimens are\r\nadvised to call on the Secretary of the British Museum (Natural History),\r\nCromwell Road, S.W.
