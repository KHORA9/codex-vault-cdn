R. Matoon and C. B. Webster in 1928. The sections,\r\n“Trees as Mankind’s Friends”, “Studying a Tree”, “Other Texas Trees”,\r\ndrawings of twigs, leaves and fruits, and the glossary were incorporated\r\ninto the fourth and fifth editions by S. L. Frost and D. A. Anderson.\r\nThe sixth and seventh editions were edited by H. E. Weaver and W. A.\r\nSmith, respectively. Some of the drawings used in this publication were\r\nmade available by the United States Forest Service.\r\n\r\nThe eighth edition was revised and edited by John A. Haislet to conform\r\nwith the nomenclature in _Check List of Native and Naturalized Trees of\r\nthe United States (Including Alaska)_, Agriculture Handbook No. 41,\r\nprepared under the direction of the United States Forest Service Tree\r\nand Range Plant Committee. D. A. Anderson’s “A Guide to the\r\nIdentification of the Principal Trees and Shrubs of Texas” was revised\r\nand incorporated in the eighth edition to give it greater utility to the\r\nnon-technical student of trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      TREES ... MANKIND’S FRIENDS\r\n\r\n\r\nTrees have held an important place in man’s way of life since he has\r\nbeen on the earth. Trees provided early man with weapons to defend\r\nhimself and helped provide him with food, shelter and fuel.\r\n\r\nTrees have played an important role in the history of the United States.\r\nTimber was our nation’s first export. The forest also provided our\r\nforefathers with their homes, farm implements, rifle stocks and wagons.\r\nThe forest, by furnishing ties and utility poles, made possible the\r\nexpansion of railroad systems, electric power and telephone networks.\r\nEvery industry depends upon forest products in one way or another.\r\n\r\nTrees are more important today than ever before. More than 10,000\r\nproducts are reportedly made from trees. Through chemistry, the humble\r\nwoodpile is yielding chemicals, plastics and fabrics that were beyond\r\ncomprehension when an axe first felled a Texas tree.\r\n\r\nThe American standard of living depends to no small extent on the care\r\nwith which we use our forest resource. Fortunately, trees are a\r\nrenewable resource. They can be grown as a crop and harvested in such a\r\nway that the stand is kept productive, and a steady supply of forest\r\nproducts is assured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              TEXAS TREES\r\n\r\n\r\nA tree is generally defined as a woody plant having one well-defined\r\nstem and a more or less definitely formed crown, usually attaining a\r\nheight of at least eight feet. Using water and minerals from the soil,\r\ngases from the air and energy from the sun, a tree manufactures the food\r\nit needs for growth and reproduction. Trees, like man, grow rapidly when\r\nthey are young but gradually their growth decreases; they begin to\r\ndeteriorate and eventually die. Nature then reduces them to the elements\r\nfrom which they were derived.\r\n\r\nThe terms “hardwood,” “softwood,” “deciduous” and “non-deciduous” are\r\noften encountered in tree literature. These terms are confusing and\r\noften misleading. Needle-bearing or cone-bearing trees are designated as\r\nsoftwoods even though the wood may be dense. Hardwoods are the\r\nbroad-leaved (unlike needles or scales) trees, the wood of which may be\r\ndense or soft.\r\n\r\nThe conifers, or softwoods, generally retain their leaves more than one\r\ngrowing season and produce seed in cones; however, there are exceptions.\r\nBaldcypress, a conifer, is deciduous since it sheds its leaves in\r\nautumn. Cedar and juniper produce berry-like cones that scarcely\r\nresemble cones.\r\n\r\nThe hardwoods, or broad-leaved trees, are generally deciduous; i.e.,\r\nthey shed their leaves in autumn. Texas has many exceptions, for\r\nexample: southern magnolia, live oak and American holly which retain\r\ngreen leaves through the winter.\r\n\r\nMore than half of the 1,100 species of native trees in the United States\r\nare found in the South. Of these, more than 200 species and varieties\r\nare native to Texas. In addition, many exotic species have been\r\nintroduced and now grow in many parts of the state.\r\n\r\nThe four main forest regions of Texas include: the Southern pine forest\r\nin East Texas; the central hardwoods, the post oak and cross timbers of\r\nNorth-central Texas; the semi-tropical forest in the Rio Grande Valley\r\nregion of Texas; and the mountain forest, the timbered areas of West\r\nTexas which are a continuation of the timber types of the Southern Rocky\r\nMountains. In Texas, trees are the principal vegetative cover on an\r\nestimated area of 28,805,617 acres.\r\n\r\n                      [Illustration: TREE REGIONS]\r\n\r\n  PINE-HARDWOOD\r\n  CEDAR BREAKS\r\n  POST OAK\r\n  WEST CROSS TIMBERS\r\n  EAST CROSS TIMBERS\r\n  MOUNTAIN FORESTS\r\n\r\nTexas also has minor tree areas which are almost restricted to Texas;\r\nthe cedar breaks and the oak shinneries. Some of the shinnery trees are\r\namong the smallest in America. In places, fully matured trees are not\r\nover knee-high and resemble pigmy forests. In other areas, the same\r\nspecies grows 20 to 30 feet tall to form almost impenetrable thickets.\r\n\r\nThe pine-hardwood forests of East Texas, comprise 12,525,417 acres in\r\nall or part of 42 counties. Lumber, paper, baskets, boxes, ties, poles,\r\npiling, posts, handles and shingles constitute the main forest products\r\nmanufactured in the Piney Woods of East Texas.\r\n\r\nFarther west, in East Central Texas, the post oak forests cover\r\napproximately 5,030,200 acres in all or part of 39 counties.\r\n\r\nThe east and west “cross timbers”, occur on an area of approximately 3\r\nmillion acres. The term “cross timbers” originated with the early\r\nsettlers who, in their travels from east to west, crossed alternating\r\npatches of forests and prairies and so affixed the name “cross timbers”\r\nto these forests.\r\n\r\nFarther south in the Edwards Plateau region, are the cedar breaks which\r\nextend over 3¾ million acres. Cedar grows on the steep slopes and\r\nrolling hills common to this region, in association with live oak and\r\nmesquite.\r\n\r\nOther tree areas of the state include an estimated 500,000 acres of\r\nmountain forests in the Trans-Pecos Region and the live oak area along\r\nthe Gulf Coast.\r\n\r\nTwo of Texas’ trees, guaiacum and ebony, produce the hardest woods in\r\nthe United States. Both species are found in the Rio Grande Valley. The\r\ntree with the lightest wood in the United States, corkwood, grows near\r\nthe mouth of the Brazos River. Drooping or weeping juniper, so named for\r\nthe drooping characteristic of its branches, grows in the Big Bend area\r\nbut has not been reported to be native elsewhere in this country.\r\n\r\nCatclaw, huisache, mimosa, baretta, pistache, black persimmon, Mexican\r\nash, anaqua, flatwoods plum (sloe) and guajillo are other trees common\r\nonly in Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          TEXAS FOREST SERVICE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1915, the 34th Texas Legislature created by law the State Department\r\nof Forestry and made it a part of the Agricultural and Mechanical\r\nCollege of Texas. In 1925, the department became the Texas Forest\r\nService. As it grew, its service to Texas increased. It now helps\r\nprotect Texas’ forest resources against fire, insects and disease;\r\nassists woodland owners in the proper management of their lands; makes\r\navailable seedlings for reforestation and windbreak purposes; conducts\r\nresearch in forest tree improvement, management and utilization; and\r\nconducts an educational program to acquaint Texans as to the\r\ndesirability of practicing forestry.\r\n\r\nThe Texas Forest Service, with more than 300 employees, has four\r\ndepartments: Forest Fire Control, Forest Management, Forest Products,\r\nand Information and Education. The offices of the Director, and of the\r\nForest Management and the Information and Education Departments are in\r\nCollege Station. Forest Fire Control and Forest Products Department\r\nheadquarters are in Lufkin.\r\n\r\nSeven administrative districts, each headed by a district forester, are\r\nresponsible for the activities of the Texas Forest Service in the areas\r\nof intensive and extensive forest fire protection. District headquarters\r\nare located at Linden, Henderson, Lufkin, Woodville, Kirbyville, Conroe\r\nand College Station.\r\n\r\nMore than 10 million acres of state and privately owned timberland in\r\nthe Piney Woods are now under intensive protection against fire, insects\r\nand diseases. An additional area of 5 million acres, commonly referred\r\nto as the post oak region, west of and adjacent to the pine-hardwood\r\narea, has been under extensive protection beginning with 1962.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       TEXAS FORESTRY ASSOCIATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Texas Forestry Association is a statewide, nonprofit agency\r\nconcerned primarily with the educational phase of forest conservation.\r\nOrganized in 1914, the Association was largely responsible for the\r\npassage of the law which created the Department of Forestry at the\r\nAgricultural and Mechanical College of Texas, and from which the Texas\r\nForest Service emerged.\r\n\r\nFor more than 48 years, this organization has cooperated with the Texas\r\nForest Service and other interested agencies in promoting the forest\r\neconomy of Texas. Membership in the Texas Forestry Association is open\r\nto all conservation-minded citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               ARBOR DAY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe growing dependency of man upon forest resources for raw materials,\r\nproducts, watershed protection, conservation of certain wildlife and\r\nrecreation gives added significance to Arbor Day which is set aside\r\nannually to pay tribute to trees.\r\n\r\nArbor Day originated in Nebraska in 1872. It was first celebrated in\r\nTexas in 1889 on George Washington’s birthday, February 22. In 1949, the\r\nTexas State Legislature adopted the following resolution:\r\n\r\n  _Resolved, by the House of Representatives of the State of Texas, the\r\n  Senate concurring, That the third Friday in January of each year be\r\n  designated as “Arbor Day”, to be devoted to the planting and\r\n  cultivation of forest, shade and ornamental trees throughout the State\r\n  and to be observed for that purpose in such manner as may seem best to\r\n  the people of each community; and be it further_\r\n\r\n  _Resolved, That the Governor of Texas be requested to issue an\r\n  appropriate proclamation annually to encourage the proper observance\r\n  of such “Arbor Day”._\r\n\r\nArbor Day can best be celebrated by planting one or more suitable trees\r\naround a school or club area or by establishing a school plantation. In\r\naddition to paying tribute to the beauty of trees, one can call\r\nattention to the importance of trees to man’s welfare. The Texas Forest\r\nService continues to assist clubs and schools in organizing Arbor Day\r\nprograms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               STATE TREE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pecan, _Carya illinoensis_, (Wangenh.) K. Koch, was officially\r\ndesignated as the state tree of Texas by an act of the legislature in\r\nJune 1919.\r\n\r\nBy an amendment in 1927, certain state agencies were requested to give\r\ndue consideration to the pecan tree when beautifying state parks and\r\nother public property belonging to the state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             STUDYING TREES\r\n\r\n\r\nTrees, like people, become friends only when we have become well\r\nacquainted with them and have a knowledge of the characteristics that\r\nmake them something special to us. This bulletin about the trees of\r\nTexas may be used as a handy reference for identifying trees you do not\r\nknow, or it may be used as the basis for developing tree friends. The\r\nfollowing is a guide or lesson plan that will help make a friend of each\r\ntree studied.\r\n\r\n  I. Object of Study\r\n      Each kind of tree has certain identifying characteristics which\r\n      mark it as being different from other kinds of species of trees.\r\n      By careful observation and examination these identifying points\r\n      may be learned and you can feel that you know the tree.\r\n  II. Source of Study Material\r\n    1. The locality in which you live probably has some trees you know.\r\n          Why do you know them? Start by studying these trees and make\r\n          them fast friends.\r\n    2. You also will find some trees you are not sure about or do not\r\n          know; next, study these one by one until you are sure you will\r\n          always know them.\r\n    3. Wherever you may be or whenever you see a tree you do not know,\r\n          observe it carefully, collect enough facts and sample material\r\n          to study until you learn to know it.\r\n    4. Books, articles, pictures and references will help to learn some\r\n          trees you cannot actually see but which are of interest to\r\n          you.\r\n  III. Approach to Tree Study\r\n    1. One tree should be studied at a time as a general rule although\r\n          it may be an advantage to select somewhat similar trees and\r\n          study them by comparisons.\r\n    2. Field study of the growing tree is the most satisfactory. Observe\r\n          a number of the same kind of trees as there are individual\r\n          variations in some characteristics.\r\n    3. If possible collect for reference and further study samples of\r\n          leaves, twigs, bark, wood, flowers and fruit. BE CAREFUL in\r\n          collecting samples. It is better not to have samples than to\r\n          deface or injure the tree. No one will object to your studying\r\n          their trees if you do no damage.\r\n  IV. Procedure\r\n    1. General\r\n      (a) First observe the tree as a whole taking into consideration\r\n          all the points that attract your attention. Very often there\r\n          will be some one thing that either alone or in relation to\r\n          other points attracts your attention. That feature when\r\n          studied may be the key to your really learning to know the\r\n          tree.\r\n      (b) The suggestions that follow as to observations of various\r\n          parts of the tree do not limit the study of those points for\r\n          perhaps you will learn to know the tree from some feature not\r\n          listed.\r\n    2. Form of tree\r\n          Note the size, shape and branching habit; observe its location\r\n          in relation to other trees that might affect its form.\r\n    3. Bark\r\n          Observe thickness, roughness, type of fissures and color of\r\n          bark. Studying the bark as a means of winter identification is\r\n          particularly worthwhile.\r\n    4. Leaves\r\n          Study type, size, shape and variations on the same tree; note\r\n          arrangement on twigs; describe by the blade, stalk, margin,\r\n          venation, base and tip; know their texture and color.\r\n    5. Twigs\r\n          Note lateral arrangement on branches; observe whether flexible\r\n          or stocky and whether rough or smooth; study differences\r\n          between new growth and old; learn any distinctive color,\r\n          smell, or taste; cut a cross-section and note size, shape,\r\n          color and size of pith; note presence or absence of lenticels.\r\n    6. Buds\r\n          Like bark, the buds are helpful in winter identification. Note\r\n          size, scale coverings, and shape. Observe arrangement and\r\n          position on twigs; compare terminal and lateral buds.\r\n    7. Leaf-scars\r\n          Study scars left by falling leaves as to size, form, position\r\n          and occurrence; note bundle-scars (appear as marks in scar) as\r\n          to number, shape, size, and arrangement.\r\n    8. Flowers\r\n          Study promptly at proper season; trees vary widely in\r\n          flowering habits; observe as to size, form, shape of parts,\r\n          color and arrangement; and learn whether the tree has one or\r\n          two kinds of flowers—if two, whether male and female flowers\r\n          are on same tree.\r\n    9. Fruit\r\n          Study of fruit also is seasonal. When it is available, observe\r\n          type, form, structure and method of distribution.\r\n    10. Wood\r\n          Identification of trees by wood forms a separate study but\r\n          often field identification of trees can be aided by\r\n          observation of distinctive points about the wood such as\r\n          color, taste and general structure.\r\n    11. Habitat\r\n          An interesting and often useful help in tree identification is\r\n          to note the growing habits of trees, whether in dry or moist\r\n          places, what other species same type sites, whether it grows\r\n          better in open places or in more sheltered locations and the\r\n          like.\r\n  V. Summary\r\n      If you have followed through on your study of a tree, covering the\r\n      eleven points listed, you will really know the tree for all time.\r\n      However, even if you cannot or do not make your study as\r\n      thoroughly as is suggested, you should at least select enough\r\n      distinctive characteristics about the tree to study that you will\r\n      be able to identify it both in the summer and the winter seasons.\r\n  VI. References\r\n      Your school and public library should have one or more books on\r\n      trees. You will find books on southern trees most helpful. While\r\n      it is impractical to provide a complete list of books on trees,\r\n      the partial list below is furnished for your information, with the\r\n      understanding that no discrimination is intended:\r\n      Fernald, M.

In Texas, limber pine may be found in the\r\nGuadalupe and Davis Mountains of West Texas.\r\n\r\nAs the name indicates, the branches and twigs are especially flexible\r\nand tough, often light purple in color. The branches form a rounded tree\r\ntop or head. The trunk is stout and noticeably tapered.\r\n\r\nThe needle-like LEAVES are in clusters of five. They are stiff and\r\nstout, about 2 to 3 inches long, and arranged in clusters or tufts near\r\nthe ends of the branches. They stay on the twig for five or six years.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: LIMBER PINE (Fruit and leaves, one-third natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe “FRUIT”, a cone, is relatively short or stocky, mostly from 3 to 6\r\ninches long, made up of rounded rather thick scales, some turned forward\r\nand some backward. The cone is short-stalked. As with all the pines, the\r\nseeds mature at the end of the second season of growth.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is relatively soft, close-grained, slightly yellowish or\r\nreddish. It is not cut in quantity and the trees are usually rather\r\nlimby and short-bodied, which largely accounts for the small commercial\r\nuse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           PINYON (Nut Pine)\r\n                          Pinus edulis Engelm.\r\n\r\n\r\nPinyon is found as scattered trees or in small groves over the mountains\r\nand canyons in the western part of the state to elevations of 8,000\r\nfeet. It is a small tree, grows on warm slopes or in sheltered\r\nlocations, and forms a bushy top with orange-colored branchlets.\r\n\r\nThe needle-like LEAVES grow in bundles of two (rarely 3); whereas in\r\nPinus cembroides Zucc., the Mexican Pinyon, there are usually three\r\nneedles per cluster. The dark green needles are approximately one inch\r\nlong, stiff, stout, and curved. They remain on the tree from 5 to 8\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n                 [Illustration: PINYON (Natural size)]\r\n\r\nLike all the pines, it has male and female “FLOWERS” separate on the\r\nsame tree. The “FRUIT”, a cone, is rounded, about 1 to 2 inches across,\r\nand produces large seeds or “nuts”, from ½ to ¾ inch long. The seeds are\r\nrich in food value and form an important article of diet for the\r\nIndians. The seeds are gathered and sold widely as fancy “nuts” in many\r\nlarger towns and cities.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is light, soft, close-grained, and pale brown, used for fuel\r\nand sometimes as fencing. A close relative P. cembroides is found\r\nscattered in the Texas cedar breaks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  PONDEROSA PINE (Western Yellow Pine)\r\n                         Pinus ponderosa Laws.\r\n\r\n\r\nPonderosa pine is the most important commercial pine of the Southwest\r\nand many parts of the Rocky Mountain region. It reaches the southeastern\r\nlimit of its range in the Guadalupe and Davis Mountains of West Texas\r\nwhere it is scattered and of little commercial value. It is favored as\r\nan ornamental in the Texas Panhandle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PONDEROSA PINE (Fruit and leaves, one-half natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe needle-like LEAVES are in bundles of three and are mostly 5 to 8\r\ninches long. The needles, massed toward the ends of naked branches,\r\nremain on the tree about 3 years.\r\n\r\nThe “FRUIT”, a short-stalked cone, is oval-shaped, reddish-brown, and\r\narmed with stout recurved prickles.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD of this species, from trees in the commercial part of its\r\nrange, is of excellent quality for lumber. The wood is hard, strong, and\r\nrather fine grained. The heartwood is light reddish-white and the\r\nsapwood nearly white. Lumber from this tree is widely used for house\r\nconstruction and furniture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             LOBLOLLY PINE\r\n                             Pinus taeda L.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis fast-growing yellow pine is the most abundant and valuable species\r\nin Southeast Texas from Orange County west to Walker and Waller\r\nCounties. The species is also abundant northward to the Oklahoma line.\r\nLoblolly pine also constitutes the pine of the “Lost Pine Region” in the\r\nvicinity of Bastrop.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOBLOLLY PINE (Fruit and leaves, one-half natural size)]\r\n\r\nLoblolly invades abandoned fields rapidly. For this reason it is often\r\ncalled old field pine. In the virgin forest of Texas, loblolly pine was\r\nmost common along banks of streams. It is still the dominant pine on\r\nmoist sites, but may also be found in relatively dry sites.\r\n\r\nThe dark-colored BARK is deeply furrowed and often attains a thickness\r\nof as much as 2 inches on large-sized trees. The needle-like LEAVES, 6\r\nto 9 inches long, are borne three (occasionally two) in a cluster. In\r\nthe spring bright green clumps of needles grow at the end of branches\r\nand give the tree a luxuriant appearance. The “FRUIT”, a cone, ripens in\r\nthe autumn of the second year and is 3 to 5 inches long. Many seeds with\r\nwings an inch long are shed during the fall and early winter.\r\n\r\nThe resinous WOOD is coarse-grained. There is marked contrast, as in\r\nother yellow pines, between the bands of springwood and summerwood. The\r\nwood of second-growth trees has a wide range of uses such as building\r\nmaterial, box shooks, barrel staves, basket veneers, pulpwood, lath,\r\nmine props, piling, and fuel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SHORTLEAF PINE (Yellow Pine)\r\n                          Pinus echinata Mill.\r\n\r\n\r\nShortleaf pine is an important pine over a wide area in Northeast Texas,\r\nand is common in other parts of the “Piney Woods.” Essentially a tree of\r\nthe hilly section, growing in pure stands and in mixture with hardwoods,\r\nthe mature tree has a tall straight stem and an oval crown, reaching a\r\nheight of about 100 feet and a diameter of about 2½ feet. Unlike other\r\nsouthern pines, young shortleaf pine trees may reproduce by sprouts when\r\ncut or burned back.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: SHORTLEAF PINE (Fruit, natural size; leaves, two-thirds\r\n                             natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe BARK is brownish-red, broken into rectangular plates; it is thinner\r\nand lighter-colored than that of loblolly pine.\r\n\r\nThe needle-like LEAVES are in clusters of two or three (3 to 5 inches\r\nlong), slender, flexible, and dark blue-green. The “FRUIT”, a cone, or\r\nbur, the smallest of the Texas pines, are 1½ to 2½ inches long, oblong,\r\nwith small sharp prickles; are generally clustered, and often hold to\r\nthe twigs for 3 or 4 years. The small mottled seeds have a wing which is\r\nbroadest near the center.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD of old trees is rather heavy and hard, yellow-brown or orange,\r\nfine-grained, and less resinous than that of the other important\r\nSouthern pines. It is used for finishing, general construction, veneers,\r\npaper pulp, excelsior, cooperage, mine props, and other purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             LONGLEAF PINE\r\n                         Pinus palustris Mill.\r\n\r\n\r\nYoung longleaf pine with its single upright stem, candle-like silvery\r\nbuds, and long, shiny leaves form a handsome tree. In later youth the\r\nstalwart, sparingly-branched sapling, with heavy twigs and gray bark,\r\nattracts immediate attention. Mature trees have tall, straight trunks,\r\n1-3 feet in diameter and open irregular crowns.\r\n\r\nLongleaf pine grows in sandy soils from Orange County, north to Sabine\r\nCounty and west to Trinity County. A hybrid cross between longleaf and\r\nloblolly pine is often found in this range and is known as Sonderegger\r\npine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LONGLEAF PINE (Fruit and leaves, one-third natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe needle-like LEAVES are grey-green, from 10 to 15 inches long, in\r\nclusters of three, and gathered toward the ends of the thick, scaly,\r\ntwigs. The “FLOWERS”, appearing in early spring before the new leaves,\r\nare a deep rose-purple, the male in prominent, short, dense clusters and\r\nthe female in inconspicuous groups of two to four. Unlike other Southern\r\npines, common to Texas, this species grows in a “grass” stage for 2 to 5\r\nyears during which time it resembles a clump of grass. Once longleaf\r\npine starts its height growth, it grows rapidly.\r\n\r\nThe “FRUIT”, a cone bur, is 6 to 10 inches long, and slightly curved,\r\nthe thick scales armed with small curved prickles. The cones usually\r\nfall soon after the seed ripens, leaving their bases attached to the\r\ntwigs.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is heavy, hard, strong, tough and durable. It is used for\r\nconstruction. Naval stores such as turpentine and rosin are obtained\r\nfrom the tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               SLASH PINE\r\n                     Pinus elliottii var. elliottii\r\n\r\n\r\nSlash pine is not a native of Texas, its natural range in the United\r\nStates being along the coast from South Carolina to eastern Louisiana.\r\nThe initial planting of slash pine in East Texas was made on the E. O.\r\nSiecke State Forest near Kirbyville in 1926. It has been widely planted\r\nin East Texas, and has been so successful in its growth and adaptability\r\nto the region that it is now accepted as a forest tree of the State. It\r\nis much favored for reforestation by planting because of its exceedingly\r\nrapid height growth, good survival, and comparative freedom from\r\ntip-moth damage.\r\n\r\n           [Illustration: SLASH PINE (One-half natural size)]\r\n\r\nIn its native habitat a mature tree ranges to 100 feet high, with a\r\nroundtopped head and a trunk 1 to 3 feet in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe BARK ranges in thickness from ¾ to 1 inch, separating freely on the\r\nsurface into large thin scales.\r\n\r\nThe needle-like LEAVES occur in clusters of 2 and 3, are from 8 to 12\r\ninches long, and lustrous. The “FLOWERS” appear in late winter, the male\r\ndark purple, the female pink, the “FRUIT”, a cone usually 4 to 6 inches\r\nlong, is brown and glossy, the thin scales armed with fine prickles.\r\n\r\nSlash pine WOOD is exceedingly hard, very strong, durable, coarse\r\ngrained, rich, dark orange color, with thick, nearly white sapwood. In\r\nthis respect it is similar to longleaf, being sold as such, and used for\r\nthe same purpose. Naval stores, lumber, pulpwood and other products can\r\nbe produced from this tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              DOUGLAS-FIR\r\n           Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca (Belssn.) Franco\r\n\r\n\r\nThis valuable timber tree of the western United States reaches its\r\nextreme southeastern limit in the mountains of West Texas. It is a small\r\ntree locally but in the Pacific Northwest Douglas-fir reaches a height\r\nof 250 feet and a diameter of 10 to 12 feet.\r\n\r\nThe needle-like LEAVES are linear, more or less flattened, about an inch\r\nin length, bluish green, and arranged closely in spirals around the\r\nstem. They remain on the twigs for many years. The buds are a rich\r\nreddish-brown and pointed.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: DOUGLAS-FIR (Fruit and leaves, one-half natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe “FRUIT”, a cone, unlike that of true firs, hangs downward and is\r\neasily identified by the protruding bracts, or “straws.” The mature\r\ncones are 2 to 4 inches long, and brownish-red.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is moderately light, reddish tinted and surrounded by nearly\r\nwhite sapwood. It varies widely in respect to density, quality and width\r\nof sapwood. Much high grade plywood is made from this species. Young\r\nDouglas-firs are sold as Christmas trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              BALDCYPRESS\r\n                     Taxodium distichum (L.) Rich.\r\n\r\n\r\nBaldcypress grows in swamps which are flooded for prolonged periods, and\r\non wet stream banks and bottomlands. It occurs in East Texas west to the\r\nNueces River. The straight trunk has numerous ascending branches, and\r\nnarrow conical outline. In old age the tree generally has a broad\r\nfluted, or buttressed base, a smooth slowly tapering trunk and a broad,\r\nopen, flat top of a few heavy branches and numerous small branchlets.\r\nVirgin-growth timber attains heights up to 130 feet and diameters up to\r\n10 feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BALDCYPRESS (Cone and leaves, seven-eighths natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe BARK is silvery to cinnamon-red, finely divided by numerous\r\nlongitudinal fissures. The light green LEAVES about ½ to ¾ inch long,\r\nare arranged in feather-like fashion along two sides of small branchlets\r\nwhich fall in the autumn with the leaves still attached.\r\n\r\nThe “FRUIT”, a rounded cone, is about one inch in diameter, with thick\r\nirregular scales.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is light, soft, easily worked, with a light sap wood and\r\ndark-brown heartwood. It is particularly durable in contact with the\r\nsoil. Cypress is in demand for exterior trim of buildings, greenhouse\r\nplanking, boat and ship building, shingles, posts, poles, and crossties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             ASHE JUNIPER (Mexican Juniper--Mountain Cedar)\r\n                        Juniperus ashei Buchholz\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Central and West Texas are found no less than nine species of cedars\r\nor junipers, including one eastern, one southern, and seven western\r\nspecies. Of these, the most abundant and important is the Mexican\r\njuniper. This tree often forms extensive low forests or dense breaks on\r\nthe limestone hills and slopes of the Edwards Plateau and Grand Prairie.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: ASHE JUNIPER (Berry-like fruit and leaves, two-thirds\r\n                             natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe trunk is covered with shreddy, brown or reddish-brown BARK. The\r\nLEAVES are dark blue-green, small, opposite or arranged in 3’s, scale\r\nlike, blunt pointed, and fringed with minute teeth. On vigorous young\r\nplants the leaves are sharp pointed and longer, up to ½ inch long.\r\n\r\nThe “FRUIT”, a nearly round, dark blue, berry-like cone is covered with\r\nglaucous bloom; has a thin, pleasant-scented, sweet flesh, enclosing 1\r\nor 2 seeds; and ripens in one season.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is light, hard, light brown, close-grained but weak. It is\r\nextensively used for fence posts and fuel. The tree is sometimes planted\r\nas an ornamental.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            EASTERN REDCEDAR\r\n                        Juniperus virginiana L.\r\n\r\n\r\nRedcedar is scattered through East Texas, usually on gravelly ridges and\r\nrocky hillsides of the uplands.\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of LEAVES, usually both on the same tree. The most\r\ncommon is dark green, minute, and scale-like, clasping the twig in four\r\nranks, so that the twig appears square. The other kind, usually\r\nappearing on young growth, or vigorous shoots, is awl-shaped, quite\r\nsharp-pointed, spreading, and whitened.\r\n\r\nThe BARK is thin, reddish-brown, turning ashy-gray on exposed surfaces,\r\nand peels off in long shred-like strips. The trunk is usually more or\r\nless grooved.\r\n\r\nThe male and female FLOWERS blooming in February or March, are at the\r\nend of minute twigs on separate trees.\r\n\r\nThe “FRUIT” which matures in one season is pale blue, ¼ inch in\r\ndiameter, and berry-like, the sweet flesh enclosing one or two seeds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EASTERN REDCEDAR (Fruit and leaves, three-fourths natural\r\n                                 size)]\r\n\r\nThe HEARTWOOD is distinctly red, and the sapwood white, this color\r\ncombination making very striking effects when finished as cedar chests,\r\nclosets, and interior woodwork. The wood is aromatic, soft, strong, and\r\nof even texture, very durable in contact with the soil, and in great\r\ndemand for posts, poles, and rustic work.\r\n\r\nSince redcedar spreads the cedar-rust of apples, it is inadvisable to\r\nplant this tree in or near orchards, or anywhere in regions devoted to\r\ncommercial apple production.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              BLACK WALNUT\r\n                            Juglans nigra L.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis valuable forest tree occurs on rich bottomlands and moist fertile\r\nhillsides as far west as the San Antonio River. It may attain a height\r\nof nearly 100 feet with a straight stem, clear of branches for half of\r\nits height.\r\n\r\nThe BARK is thick, dark brown in color, and divided by rather deep\r\nfissures into rounded ridges.\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are alternate, compound, 1 to 2 feet long, consisting of from\r\n15 to 23 leaflets of a yellowish-green color. The leaflets are about 3\r\ninches long, extremely tapering at the end, and toothed along the\r\nmargin.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: BLACK WALNUT (Leaf, one-fifth natural size; fruit,\r\n          one-fourth natural size; twig, about natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe FRUIT is a nut, borne singly or in pairs, and enclosed in a solid\r\ngreen husk which does not split open, even after the nut is ripe. The\r\nnut itself is black with a very hard, thick, finely ridged shell,\r\nenclosing a rich, oily, edible kernel.\r\n\r\nThe HEARTWOOD is heavy, hard and strong. Its rich chocolate-brown color,\r\nfreedom from warping, and checking, susceptibility to a high polish, and\r\ndurability make it highly prized for furniture and cabinet work and\r\ngunstocks. Walnut is easily propagated from the nuts, and should be more\r\nwidely planted and grown for timber and nuts.\r\n\r\nLITTLE WALNUT or TEXAS WALNUT (Juglans microcarpa Berlandier) is found\r\non limestone banks of streams in western Texas. The stumps supply a\r\nbeautiful veneer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 PECAN\r\n                  Carya illinoensis (Wangenh.) K. Koch\r\n\r\n\r\nPecan, the “State tree” of Texas, is found native in the state from the\r\nPiney Woods west throughout Central Texas, centering in the watershed of\r\nthe Colorado River. It makes an excellent shade tree and is very\r\nvaluable for the nut crop it bears. Many varieties are planted in\r\norchards. The pecan is a tall-growing tree, attaining heights of over\r\n100 feet. When grown in the open it forms a large, rounded, symmetrical\r\ntop.\r\n\r\nThe outer BARK is rough, hard, tight, but broken into scales; on the\r\nlimbs it is smooth at first but later tends to scale or divide as the\r\nbark grows old.\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES resemble those of the other hickories and the black walnut.\r\nThey are made up of 9 to 17 leaflets, each oblong, toothed and\r\nlong-pointed, and 4 to 8 inches long by about 2 inches wide.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PECAN (Leaf, one-sixth natural size; fruit, one-third\r\n                             natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe FLOWERS appear in early spring and hang in tassels from 2 to 3\r\ninches long. The FRUIT is a nut 1 to 2 inches long, and ½ to 1 inch in\r\ndiameter, in a thin husk which opens along its grooved seams when the\r\nfruit ripens in the fall. The nuts vary in size and thickness of shell.\r\nCultivated varieties are sold on the market in large quantities.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is heavy, hard, brittle, not strong, and of little value except\r\nfor fuel and wagon stock. Some wood is satisfactory for making softball\r\nbats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       BITTERNUT HICKORY (Pignut)\r\n                  Carya cordiformis (Wangenh.) K. Koch\r\n\r\n\r\nBitternut, the only hickory with bright yellow buds, is a tall slender\r\ntree with a broad pyramidal crown, attaining a height of 100 feet and a\r\ndiameter of 2 to 3 feet. It is found in the eastern part of the state on\r\nmoist rich soils, and is not abundant.\r\n\r\nThe BARK on the trunk is granite-gray, faintly tinged with yellow, less\r\nrough than in most hickories, yet broken into thin, plate-like scales.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BITTERNUT HICKORY (Twig, one-half natural size; leaf and\r\n                    fruit, one-third natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe bright yellow winter BUDS are compressed and scurfy. The LEAVES are\r\nalternate, compound, from 6 to 10 inches long, and composed of 5 to 11\r\nleaflets. The individual leaflets are smaller and more slender than\r\nthose of the other hickories.\r\n\r\nThe male and female FLOWERS are on the same tree. The FRUIT is about 1\r\ninch long and thin-husked, while the nut has a thin, smoothish, gray,\r\nbrittle shell. The kernel is bitter.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is hard, strong, and heavy; reddish-brown in color, and often\r\ncalled red hickory. It has the same uses as the other hickories but is\r\nsaid to be inferior.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             WATER HICKORY\r\n                    Carya aquatica (Michx. f.) Nutt.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis tree, as its name indicates, grows in bottomlands and rich, wet\r\nwoods. It is found throughout the eastern portion of the state. It is\r\nnot a large hickory, seldom attaining a height of 100 feet or a diameter\r\nof 2 feet. It is slender, with upright branches forming a narrow head.\r\nIt is easily distinguished from other hickories by its reddish-brown\r\nwinter buds which are covered with yellow glands that fall off easily.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: WATER HICKORY (Fruit and twig, two-thirds natural size;\r\n                    leaf, one-fourth natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe light brown BARK separates freely into long, loose, thick,\r\nplate-like scales.\r\n\r\nLEAVES are alternate, compound, 9 to 15 inches long, with 7 to 13\r\nslender leaflets. The FLOWERS are like those of other hickories. The\r\nFRUIT, often borne in clusters of 3 or 4, is a rather oblong nut,\r\nconspicuously four-angled, with a thin, red-brown hull that splits\r\ntardily. The nut itself is nearly as broad as long, four-angled and\r\nridged, with a thin shell and bitter kernel.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is heavy, strong, close grained, brown, and rather brittle.\r\nProbably used only for fuel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            SHAGBARK HICKORY\r\n                      Carya ovata (Mill.) K. Koch\r\n\r\n\r\nShagbark hickory is found from eastern Texas to Florida and north to the\r\nSt. Lawrence River and Minnesota. It is a large tree of commercial\r\nimportance reaching 100 feet in height and 2 to 3 feet in diameter. It\r\nthrives best on rich, damp soil.\r\n\r\nThe BARK of the trunk is rougher than on other hickories, light gray and\r\nseparating into thick plates which are only slightly attached to the\r\ntree. The large terminal winter buds are egg-shaped, the persistent\r\nouter bud-scales having narrow tips.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: SHAGBARK HICKORY (Leaf, one-third natural size; twig,\r\n        one-half natural size; fruit, one-fourth natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are alternate, compound, from 8 to 15 inches long and\r\ncomposed of 5, rarely 7, obovate to ovate leaflets. The twigs are smooth\r\nor clothed with short hairs.\r\n\r\nThe male and female FLOWERS open after the leaves have attained nearly\r\nfull size.\r\n\r\nThe FRUIT is borne singly or in pairs and is globular. The husk is thick\r\nand deeply grooved at the seams. The nut is pale, the shell thin, and\r\nthe kernel sweet. It is sold in commercial quantities.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is heavy, hard, tough, and strong. It is used in the\r\nmanufacture of agricultural implements, tool handles, wagons, and sports\r\nequipment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           MOCKERNUT HICKORY\r\n                         Carya tomentosa Nutt.\r\n\r\n\r\nMockernut, white, or bigbud hickory, is common on well-drained soils in\r\nthe eastern part of the state. It is a short-limbed tree up to 60 feet\r\nhigh and 1 to 2 feet in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe BARK is dark gray, hard, closely and deeply furrowed, often\r\napparently cross-furrowed or netted. The winter BUDS are large, round or\r\nbroadly egg-shaped, and covered with downy, hard scales. The outer, dark\r\nscales fall off readily in the autumn. The recent shoots are short,\r\nstout and more or less covered with a downy growth.\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are large, strong-scented, and hairy; composed of 7 to 9\r\nobovate to oblong, pointed leaflets pale to orange-brown on the lower\r\nsurface. The leaves turn a beautiful yellow in the fall.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: MOCKERNUT HICKORY (Leaf, one-fifth natural size; twig,\r\n        two-thirds natural size; fruit, one-third natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe FLOWERS are of two kinds on the same tree; the male in\r\nthree-branched catkins, the female in clusters of 2 to 5. The FRUIT is\r\noval, nearly round or slightly pear-shaped with a very thick,\r\nstrong-scented husk which splits nearly to the base when ripe. The nut\r\nsometimes has 4 to 6 ridges; is reddish-brown, thick shelled, and has a\r\nsmall, sweet kernel.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is heavy, hard, tough, and strong. It is white except for the\r\ncomparatively small, dark-brown heart, hence the name white hickory. It\r\nis used for the same purpose as shagbark hickory and makes an excellent\r\nfuel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             BLACK HICKORY\r\n                          Carya texana Buckl.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a common hickory in northern and eastern Texas, growing on\r\nhillsides and sandy uplands with post and black jack oaks. It is\r\ndistinguished by its rusty brown hairs found on the young leaves and\r\nbranches. It forms a tree 60 to 75 feet high, with a trunk 2 feet in\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: BLACK HICKORY (Leaf, one-fourth natural size; fruit,\r\n       one-third natural size; twig, three-fourths natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe BARK is dark gray or nearly black, deeply divided into rough ridges,\r\nor it may be irregularly fissured and separated into thin scales. The\r\nwinter buds are ovoid and covered with rusty hairs mixed with silvery\r\nscales.\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES, 8 to 12 inches long with 5 to 7, usually 7, leaflets and\r\nrusty-hairy slender petioles, are dark green, lustrous above; much paler\r\nbeneath. The FLOWERS are similar to other hickories.\r\n\r\nThe FRUIT is obovoid, narrow, or abruptly contracted into a short stalk\r\nat the base, with a husk ¹/₁₂ to ⅙ inch thick, splitting to the middle\r\nor nearly to the base. The sweet-seeded nut is nearly obovoid to oblong,\r\nrounded at the ends, compressed and slightly four-angled, with a shell ⅙\r\nto ⅕ inch thick.\r\n\r\nThe hard, brittle WOOD is used chiefly for fuel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CORKWOOD\r\n                       Leitneria floridana Chapm.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis lightest of all native woods in the United States grows in river\r\nswamps near the Gulf, about the mouth of the Brazos River. It is a small\r\ntree reaching a height of 20 feet, or a shrub, depending upon the\r\nlocation and natural conditions. The base is usually swollen. The\r\nstraight, gradually tapering trunk is crowned with a loose, open-topped\r\nhead. The young branchlets are coated with hairs which later drop,\r\nleaving a smooth, dark, red-brown stem.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: CORKWOOD (Leaf, one-half natural size; fruit and winter\r\n                          twig, natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe simple, alternate LEAVES are from 4 to 6 inches long and about 2\r\ninches wide, borne on petioles 1 or 2 inches long. The leaves are shiny\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nThe FLOWERS are in catkins of two kinds or sexes, the male about 1½\r\ninches long, the female about ¾ inch long. Both kinds are borne on the\r\nsame tree and appear about the first of March. The FRUIT is solitary or\r\nin clusters of 2 to 4, each about ½ to ¾ inch long, and ripens when the\r\nleaves are about one-half grown. The WOOD is soft, exceedingly light,\r\ngenerally uniform in texture and of a pale yellow color. It is used as a\r\nsubstitute for cork for floats on fishing nets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           EASTERN COTTONWOOD\r\n                       Populus deltoides (Bartr.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis cottonwood is found along streams throughout the state. The tree is\r\neasily propagated by cutting and grows rapidly, hence it has been widely\r\nplanted to get shade quickly. The tree is often unsatisfactory for shade\r\nbecause it begins to shed its leaves by midsummer. The cotton-bearing\r\nseeds from the pistillate tree are often a nuisance. The soft wood is\r\neasily broken by winds; and the rank growth of the roots often results\r\nin stopping drain pipes and cracking and lifting sidewalks.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: EASTERN COTTONWOOD (Leaf, one-half natural size; twig,\r\n                        one-third natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are simple, alternate, broadly ovate or triangular, pointed,\r\nsquare at the base, and coarsely toothed on the edges, 3 to 5 inches\r\nacross each way, covered with soft white hairs on the under side,\r\nsupported by flattened slender petioles, 2 to 3 inches long. The winter\r\nbuds are covered with chestnut-brown, resinous scales. The male and\r\nfemale FLOWERS are in catkins on separate trees and appear before the\r\nleaves. The FRUIT, a capsule, contains a number of seed with white silky\r\nhairs which permit the winds to carry the seed for long distances.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is soft, light-weight, warps easily upon drying, but is used\r\nfor many purposes, sometimes as a substitute for yellow poplar and\r\nlinden.\r\n\r\nThree other species of Southern cottonwood occur in western Texas. One\r\nspecies, P. sargentii Dode, which has long pointed leaves, is found in\r\nthe Panhandle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              BLACK WILLOW\r\n                           Salix nigra Marsh.\r\n\r\n\r\nBlack willow is found along streams throughout the state. It rarely\r\ngrows taller than 50 feet and is frequently found growing singly or in\r\nclumps along the water courses. In winter the easily separable bright\r\nreddish-brown or golden, naked twigs are quite conspicuous.\r\n\r\nThe BARK is deeply divided into broad, flat ridges which separate into\r\nthick plate-like scales. On old trees it becomes shaggy. In color it\r\nvaries from light brown tinged with orange, to nearly black.\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are from 3 to 6 inches long, and less than ½ inch wide; the\r\ntips are greatly tapered and the entire margin finely toothed. The\r\nleaves are bright green on both sides, turning pale yellow in the early\r\nautumn.\r\n\r\nThe FLOWERS are in catkins, the male and female on separate trees.\r\n\r\nThe FRUIT is a capsule containing numerous minute seeds with long silky\r\nhairs which enable them to be blown long distances.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: BLACK WILLOW (Leaf, two-thirds natural size; fruit and\r\n                          twig, natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is soft, light, and not strong. A high grade of charcoal, used\r\nin the manufacture of gunpowder, is obtained from willow wood, and it is\r\nthe chief wood used in manufacture of artificial limbs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     AMERICAN HORNBEAM (Blue Beech)\r\n                       Carpinus caroliniana Walt.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmerican hornbeam or blue beech, also known as ironwood and water beech,\r\nis a small slow-growing, bushy tree with a spreading top of slender,\r\ncrooked or drooping branches. It is found along streams and in low\r\nground, usually in the shade of other trees. Its height is usually from\r\n20 to 30 feet and its diameter 4 to 8 inches, although it sometimes\r\ngrows larger.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AMERICAN HORNBEAM (Leaf and fruit, one-half natural size;\r\n                          twig, natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe TRUNK is fluted with irregular ridges or “muscles” extending up and\r\ndown the tree. The BARK is smooth, light brownish-gray to dark\r\nbluish-gray in color, sometimes marked with dark bands extending\r\nhorizontally on the trunk.\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are simple, alternate, oval, long-pointed, doubly toothed\r\nalong the margin, and 1 to 3 inches long. They resemble those of the\r\nblack or sweet birch, but are smaller.\r\n\r\nThe FLOWERS are borne in catkins separately on the same tree; the male\r\ncatkin about 1½ inches long, the female, about ¾ of an inch, with small,\r\nleaf-like, three-lobed green scales. The FRUIT is a nutlet about ⅓ inch\r\nlong. It falls, attached to the leaf-like scale which acts as a wing\r\naiding its distribution by the wind.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is tough, close-grained, heavy, and strong. It is sometimes\r\nselected for use for levers, tool handles, wooden cogs, mallets, wedges,\r\netc. The tree is of little commercial importance and often occupies\r\nspace in the woods that should be utilized by more valuable species.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     EASTERN HOPHORNBEAM (Ironwood)\r\n                   Ostrya virginiana (Mill.) K. Koch\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tree gets its common names from the qualities of its wood and the\r\nhop-like fruit. It is a small, slender, generally round-topped tree,\r\nfrom 20 to 30 feet high and 7 to 10 inches in diameter. The top consists\r\nof long slender branches, commonly drooping toward the ends. It is found\r\nmostly on rather dry soils throughout the uplands of the eastern part of\r\nthe state.\r\n\r\nThe BARK is mostly light, gray-brown, or reddish-brown, and finely\r\ndivided into thin scales.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: EASTERN HOPHORNBEAM (Twig, three-fifths natural size;\r\n                leaf and fruit, one-half natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are simple, alternate, generally oblong with narrow tips,\r\nsharply doubly toothed along the margin, and from 2 to 3 inches long.\r\n\r\nThe FLOWERS are of two kinds on the same tree; the male, in drooping\r\ncatkins which form the previous summer, the female, in erect catkins on\r\nthe newly formed twigs. The FRUIT, which resembles that of the common\r\nhop vines, consists of a branch of leafy bracts 1 to 2 inches long\r\ncontaining a number of flattened ribbed nutlets.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD, strong, hard, durable, light brown to white, with thick, pale\r\nsapwood, is often used for handles of tools, mallets, and other small\r\narticles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        RIVER BIRCH (Red Birch)\r\n                            Betula nigra L.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the only native birch found at low elevations in the South. It\r\noccurs in East Texas and, as the name implies, in the deep, rich soils\r\nalong the borders of streams, ponds, lakes, and swamps.\r\n\r\nThe BARK provides a ready means of identifying this tree. It varies from\r\nreddish-brown to cinnamon-red in color, and peels back in tough papery\r\nlayers. These layers persist on the trunk, presenting a very ragged and\r\nquite distinctive appearance. Unlike the bark of other birches the thin\r\npaper layers are usually covered with a gray powder. On older trees, the\r\nbark on the main trunk becomes thick, deeply furrowed, and a\r\nreddish-brown color.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: RIVER BIRCH (Twig, natural size; leaf and fruit,\r\n      one-half natural size; male flower, one third natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are simple, alternate, 2 to 3 inches long, more or less oval\r\nin shape, with double-toothed edge. The upper surface is dark green and\r\nthe lower a pale yellowish green.\r\n\r\nThe FLOWERS are in catkins, the two kinds growing on the same tree. The\r\nFRUIT is cone-shaped about one inch long, and densely crowded with\r\nlittle winged nutlets that ripen from May to June.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is strong and fairly close-grained. It has been used to some\r\nextent in the manufacture of wooden-ware, in turnery, and for wagon\r\nhubs. However, this tree is scattered in its distribution and is not of\r\ncommercial importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             AMERICAN BEECH\r\n                        Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeech is found in East Texas to the Trinity River on the bottomland of\r\nstreams and the margins of swamps. It is one of the most beautiful of\r\nall trees, in summer or winter.\r\n\r\nThe simple, alternate, oblong-ovate LEAVES are 3 to 4 inches long,\r\npointed at the tip, and coarsely toothed and hairy along the margin.\r\nWhen mature, they are almost leathery in texture. The beech produces a\r\ndense shade. The light brown winter buds are long, slender, and pointed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AMERICAN BEECH (Fruit, leaves, and twig, one-half natural\r\n                                 size)]\r\n\r\nThe BARK is, perhaps, the most distinctive characteristic, as it\r\nmaintains an unbroken, light gray surface throughout its life.\r\n\r\nThe little, brown, three-sided FRUITS or beechnuts are almost as well\r\nknown as chestnuts. The nuts are in pairs in a prickly involucre. The\r\nkernel is sweet and edible. The fallen fruit, known as mast, is a\r\nfavorite food of wildlife.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD of the beech is hard, strong, and tough, though it will not\r\nlast long on exposure to weather or in the soil. The tree is of economic\r\nimportance as a lumber tree, the wood being used for furniture,\r\nflooring, carpenters’ tools, and novelty wares.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          ALLEGHENY CHINKAPIN\r\n                         Castanea pumila Mill.\r\n\r\n\r\nChinkapins may grow as trees or form shrubby thickets; consequently\r\ntheir identification is at times confusing.\r\n\r\nSome taxonomists credit East Texas with one species and a variety.\r\nOthers list four species. Further study is needed.\r\n\r\nC. pumila grows in dry woods, sandy ridges, and on borders of swamps\r\nfrom Florida to East Texas north to Ark., Tenn., Pa., and N. J. It may\r\ngrow into a small tree 10 to 30 feet high and may reach 50 feet. If\r\nburned back by fires, it may send out stolons or sprouts and form dense\r\nshrubby growths. BRANCHLETS pubescent, gradually changing to a lustrous\r\nolive-green or orange-brown, then darker. The LEAVES are 4 to 6 inches\r\nlong, 1½ to 2 inches wide, oblong to ovate and acute, the margin\r\ncoarsely toothed with slender, rigid, spreading or incurved teeth. Base\r\nof leaf unequal, either rounded or wedge-shaped. Leaf at first tomentose\r\nabove and below, later yellow-green above and whitish-downy below.\r\nPetiole short, stout, and flattened on the upper side. FRUIT a single\r\nbrown, ovoid, pointed, plump, sweet, edible nut, ¾ to 1 inch long,\r\nencased in a bur covered with erect, crowded spines approximately ¾ inch\r\nlong. WOOD light, hard, strong, coarse-grained; used for fence posts and\r\nrailway ties. Of little economic importance because of its relative\r\nscarcity.

It forms a tall, wide-spreading, rather open\r\nhead. The BARK is dark, rough, divided into ridges, and usually from 1\r\nto 1½ inches thick. It seldom comprises the principal species of any\r\nforest stands, but more often occurs as individual trees. It attains a\r\ndiameter of more than 3 feet and a height of more than 100 feet, but is\r\nusually smaller.\r\n\r\nWinter BUDS covered with gray, smooth scales, while the buds of Texas\r\noak (page 44) are covered with red, densely pubescent scales.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHUMARD OAK (Twig and leaf, one-half natural size; fruit,\r\n                             natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are deciduous, simple, alternate 6 to 8 inches long by 4 to 5\r\ninches wide; 7-lobed, rarely 5, and each lobe 2 or 3-lobed or deeply\r\ntoothed. The lobes are frequently thicker than is shown in the drawing.\r\nThe leaves are smaller and more deeply lobed than those of the black\r\noak. Leaves smooth except for dense tufts of pale hairs at the axils of\r\nthe veins below.\r\n\r\nThe FRUIT is a small acorn, about ⅔ inch in diameter and ¾ to 1¼ inches\r\nlong, set in a shallow saucer-like cup.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is heavy, hard, strong, close-grained, and light reddish-brown\r\nin color, and commercially important for lumber and cross ties.\r\n\r\nThe variety shumardii has leaves with narrow lobes, a rougher, dark\r\ngrayish bark, and deeper cups to the acorns.

It is rarely over 30 feet tall or 10 inches in\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: TEXAS OAK (Leaf, two-thirds natural size; fruit, and\r\n                          twig, natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe BARK is light brown, red-tinged, deeply ridged, and broken into\r\nplate-like scales.\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are deciduous 2½ to 3 inches wide, 3 to 3½ inches long;\r\nwidest above the middle; divided into 5 to 7 lobes, with the terminal\r\nlobe 3-lobed; dark green and shiny above, pale-shiny below; petiole\r\nslender, about 1 inch long.\r\n\r\nThe FRUIT is short-stemmed, usually single, ¼ to ¾ inch long and broad,\r\nvarying to nearly 1 inch long and ⅓ inch broad, set in a cup that covers\r\none-third or less of the fruit, reddish-brown and often streaked with\r\ndark lines.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is most useful for fuel.\r\n\r\nGRAVES OAK (Q. gravesii Sudw.) is found in the Davis and Chisos\r\nMountains of southwestern Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               BLACK OAK\r\n                         Quercus velutina Lam.\r\n\r\n\r\nBlack oak, also called yellow oak, reaches 80 feet in height and 1 to 3\r\nfeet in diameter. It grows in East Texas, and in the hills and canyons\r\nnear the mouth of the Pecos River. The crown is irregularly shaped and\r\nwide, with a clear trunk for 20 feet or more on large trees. The BARK on\r\nthe very young trunks is smooth and dark brown, but soon becomes thick\r\nand black with deep furrows and rough broken edges. The bright yellow\r\ncolor and bitter taste of the inner bark are distinguishing\r\ncharacteristics.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: BLACK OAK (Twig and fruit, one-half natural size; leaf,\r\n                        one-third natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are deciduous, alternate, simple, 5 to 10 inches long and 3\r\nto 8 inches wide, shallow or deeply lobed, the shape varying greatly.\r\nWhen mature, the leaves are dark green and shiny on the upper surface,\r\npale on the lower, more or less covered with a scurfy yellow or orange\r\ndown, and with conspicuous rusty brown hairs in the forks of the veins.\r\n\r\nThe FRUIT matures the second season. The light brown nut is from ½ to 1\r\ninch long, more or less hemispherical in shape, and from one-half to\r\nthree-fourths enclosed in the thin, dark brown, scaly cup. The yellow\r\nkernel is bitter.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD, used and marketed as red oak, is hard, heavy, strong,\r\ncoarse-grained, and checks easily. It is a bright red-brown with a thin\r\nouter edge of paler sapwood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            SOUTHERN RED OAK\r\n                         Quercus falcata Michx.\r\n\r\n\r\nSouthern red oak, commonly known as red oak and formerly as Spanish oak,\r\nusually reaches a height of 80 feet and diameter of 3 feet, although\r\nlarger trees are found. It grows on dry hills in the eastern part of the\r\nstate to the Brazos River, while three varieties are found in richer,\r\nmore moist locations. Its large spreading branches form a broad, round,\r\nopen top. The BARK is rough, not deeply furrowed, and varies from light\r\ngray on younger trees to dark gray or almost black on older ones.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: SOUTHERN RED OAK (Leaf and fruit, one-third natural\r\n                  size; twig, one-half natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are deciduous, with pear-shaped or irregular, rounded or\r\nnarrow bristle-tipped lobes, the central lobe often longest. Variety\r\npagodaefolia Ell., (Cherrybark Oak) has more numerous lobes. All leaves\r\nhave brown or gray down beneath.\r\n\r\nThe staminate FLOWERS appear as catkins 3-5 inches long in April while\r\nthe leaves unfold. The FRUIT ripens the second year. The small, rounded,\r\n½ inch long acorn is set in a thin saucer-shaped cup that tapers to a\r\nshort stalk.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is heavy, hard, strong, coarse-grained, and valuable for\r\nlumber. The bark is rich in tannin. The tree is also desirable for shade\r\nand ornamental use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             BLACKJACK OAK\r\n                      Quercus marilandica Muenchh.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of blackjack oak is said to indicate poor soil since it\r\noften occurs on dry or poorly drained, gravelly, clay, or sandy upland\r\nsoils where few other forest trees thrive. This perhaps accounts chiefly\r\nfor its slow rate of growth. It is found in those parts of the state\r\nthat support a natural tree growth, as far west as Callahan County. The\r\ntree sometimes reaches a height of 50 or 60 feet and a diameter of 16\r\ninches, but it is usually much smaller. Its hard, stiff, drooping\r\nbranches form a dense crown which usually contains many persistent dead\r\ntwigs.\r\n\r\nThe BARK is rough, very dark, often nearly black, and “blocky”; inner\r\nbark bright orange or yellow.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: BLACKJACK OAK (Twig, two-thirds natural size; leaf and\r\n                    fruit, one-third natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are deciduous, tawny-pubescent, of leathery texture, dark\r\ngreen on the upper surface, lighter underneath, broadly wedge-shaped,\r\nand variable in shape, 4 to 10 inches long and about the same in width.\r\nThe FRUIT is an acorn about ¾ inch long, yellow-brown and often striped,\r\nenclosed for half its length or more in a thick, light-brown cup. The\r\nacorns mature at the end of the second season; flesh of cotyledons\r\nyellow.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is heavy, hard and strong. It is used for firewood and is made\r\ninto charcoal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               WATER OAK\r\n                            Quercus nigra L.\r\n\r\n\r\nWater oak is native along the borders of swamps and streams and on rich\r\nbottomlands in Texas as far west as the Colorado River. It has been\r\nwidely planted along streets and in parks as a shade tree. When fully\r\ngrown this tree reaches a height of about 80 feet and a diameter\r\nexceeding 1 to 3 feet. The BARK is smooth, light brown tinged with red,\r\nand has many smooth, thin scales over the surface. Water oak can be best\r\ndistinguished from the willow oak—a close associate, but longer-lived—by\r\nthe differences in the general shape and size of leaves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WATER OAK (Leaf, one-third natural size; twig and fruit,\r\n                        one-half natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are simple, quite variable in shape, mostly oblong, broader\r\nnear the point, and more narrow at the base, giving a wedge-shaped\r\neffect, often slightly three-lobed at the outer end, thin, and of a dull\r\nbluish-green color, paler below than above; mostly smooth, and usually 2\r\nor 3 inches long and 1 to 2 inches wide; remain green for some time,\r\nthen turn yellow and gradually fall from the tree during the winter.\r\n\r\nThe FLOWERS appear in April when the leaves begin to unfold. The FRUIT,\r\nan acorn, matures at the end of the second season. The acorn is from ½\r\nto ⅔ inch long and nearly as broad, light brown or yellowish-brown and\r\noften striped, enclosed at the base only in a thin saucer-shaped cup.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is heavy, hard, and strong, light brown in color, with\r\nlighter-colored sapwood. The wood is utilized chiefly for crossties and\r\nfuel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          WILLOW OAK (Pin Oak)\r\n                           Quercus phellos L.\r\n\r\n\r\nWillow oak, also called water oak, and pin oak, occurs in the eastern\r\npart of the state to the Brazos River. It is frequently found in\r\nlowlands and along the borders of rivers and swamps, but often also on\r\nrich sandy uplands. It is a beautiful and long-lived tree, and desirable\r\nfor roadsides, lawns and parks.\r\n\r\nThe BARK is generally smooth and of a reddish-brown color; with age, the\r\nbark becomes slightly roughened and divided by narrow ridges.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLOW OAK (Twig, one-half natural size; leaf and fruit,\r\n                        one-third natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe slender willow-like LEAVES on a tree whose habit of growth is\r\nmanifestly that of an oak, make the tree easy to identify in the forest.\r\nThe deciduous leaves are 2 to 5 inches long and ½ to 1 inch wide,\r\nsmooth, light green and shiny above, but dull and usually smooth below;\r\nalternate in arrangement on the twig and borne on a short stout petiole.\r\n\r\nThe FRUIT, small acorns, closely set along the stem, matures at the end\r\nof the second year. The nut is a light yellow-brown hemisphere, about ½\r\ninch in diameter, its base scarcely enclosed in the shallow, pale\r\ngreenish-red or reddish-brown cup. The nuts are eaten as food by\r\nbluejays, grackles (blackbirds), several other species of birds, and by\r\nrodents.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is not separated commercially from other species in the red oak\r\ngroup. It is heavy, strong, rather coarse-grained, light brown tinged\r\nwith red, and not durable when exposed to the weather. It is used\r\nlocally for crossties, bridge planks, barn sills, and general\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      BLUEJACK OAK (Sandjack Oak)\r\n                         Quercus incana Bartr.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis species, which grows on dry sand hills, is usually no more than 25\r\nfeet in height and 5 or 6 inches in diameter; ranging mainly through\r\nEast Texas extending as far west as the Brazos River and scattering in\r\nCentral and Northwest Texas.\r\n\r\nThe BARK is similar to that of blackjack, being divided into thick\r\nnearly square blocks 1 to 2 inches in length and covered with small dark\r\nbrown or nearly black scales slightly tinged with red.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: BLUEJACK OAK (Leaves, twigs, and fruit about two-thirds\r\n                             natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES of this tree are oblong-lanceolate, pale blue-green above,\r\nalmost white beneath; 2 to 5 inches in length and 1 to l½ inches in\r\nwidth with a stout yellow midrib. The tree is most attractive in early\r\nspring when it is covered with the light red flowers and young leaves.\r\n\r\nACORNS are produced in great profusion, sessile, or on a short stock.\r\nThey are rounded at the ends, striate, and about ½ inch in length, and\r\nmature at the end of the second year.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is hard, strong, close-grained, light brown, tinged with red.\r\nIt has a dark colored sapwood. The wood is of no value except for fuel.\r\n\r\nThere are several hybrids of this species reported in Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               EMORY OAK\r\n                          Quercus emoryi Torr.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the canyons and on the southern slopes of the Davis and Chisos\r\nMountains occurs this interesting oak with glossy, spiny, “holly-like”\r\nleaves, and sweet, edible acorns. A small round-topped tree up to 30 or\r\n40 feet in height, the emory oak has drooping branches and slender,\r\ndecidedly reddish branchlets.\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are mostly persistent, oblong, pointed, smooth or sharply\r\ntoothed along the margin, thick, very glossy green, about 2 inches long\r\nand less than 1 inch wide.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: EMORY OAK (Leaf three-fourths natural size; fruit and\r\n                   twig, three-fourths natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe acorn, or FRUIT, is borne close to the branchlet and matures in one\r\nseason. It is oblong in shape, ½ inch or more in length, with a dark\r\nbrown or nearly black nut enclosed for about one-third its length in a\r\nnarrow cup. The latter is lined with dense gray fuzz or “tomentum.”\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is heavy, strong, somewhat brittle, close-grained, dark brown,\r\nwith light brown sapwood tinged with red. The acorns are an important\r\narticle of food for Mexicans and Indians.\r\n\r\nMEXICAN BLUE OAK (Q. oblongifolia Torr.), closely resembling emory oak,\r\nis a smaller tree and does not occur at the higher elevations (over\r\n6,000 ft.) where emory oak may be found.\r\n\r\nGRAY OAK (Quercus grisea Liebm.) occurs in the Trans-Pecos area in\r\nTexas. This species is a scrub or small tree 20 to 30 feet high, but\r\nsometimes reaching a height of 65 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                LIVE OAK\r\n                        Quercus virginiana Mill.\r\n\r\n\r\nLive oak range extends from southeastern Virginia through the lower\r\nCoastal Plain of the Atlantic and Gulf States; in Texas, from the mouth\r\nof the Rio Grande north to the Red River and west to the Guadalupe\r\nMountains, also in southern Mexico and Cuba. It is a tree of striking\r\ncharacter from its wide-spreading habit; sometimes reaching more than\r\n100 feet in spread; with a short stout trunk, 3 to 4 feet in diameter,\r\ndividing in several large limbs with nearly horizontal branches, forming\r\na low, dense, round-topped head. Its height is commonly from 40 to 50\r\nfeet. The BARK on the trunk and large branches is dark brown tinged with\r\nred, and slightly furrowed. It grows to largest size on the rich\r\nhammocks and low ridges near the coast and only a few feet above the\r\nwater level. Slow-growing and long-lived, it is one of the most\r\ndesirable trees for roadside and ornamental planting throughout most of\r\nits range. It is one of the very few trees that is apparently immune to\r\ncotton root-rot.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: LIVE OAK (Leaf, natural size; fruit and twig, one-half\r\n                             natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are simple, persistent, thick, leathery, oblong, smooth\r\nabove, pale and silvery white beneath; from 2 to 4 inches in length and\r\n1 to 2 inches in breadth.\r\n\r\nThe FRUIT is an acorn about 1 inch long and ⅓ inch wide, borne on a long\r\nstem or peduncle; it is oblong, dark brown and lustrous, and set in a\r\ntop-shaped, downy cup of a light reddish-brown color. The acorn matures\r\nat the end of the first season.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is very heavy, hard, strong and tough, light brown or yellow,\r\nwith nearly white, thin sapwood. It was formerly largely used in ship\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          MOHRS OAK (Shin Oak)\r\n                        Quercus mohriana Buckl.\r\n\r\n\r\nOver a wide section of Central Texas, on inferior soils, are found four\r\nor more species of “shin” oaks, so called from their low-growing bushy\r\nhabit. Mature trees vary from 3 to 18 feet high. These are considerably\r\nalike in foliage and fruit. The “oak shinneries” form a forest cover in\r\nCentral Texas that affords watershed protection on the head waters of\r\nsome of the state’s main rivers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOHRS OAK (Fruit, natural size; leaf, two-thirds natural\r\n                                 size)]\r\n\r\nThe tree has a thin, pale-colored BARK, rough, with deep furrows running\r\nup and down the tree.\r\n\r\nThe deciduous LEAVES of the above small-tree species of shin oak are\r\nelliptical, pointed or rounded at the end, smooth or wavy or sometimes\r\nlobed or slightly toothed along the margin. They are thick, gray-green,\r\ndense hairy beneath, about 3 inches long by 1 inch wide.\r\n\r\nThe acorns, or FRUIT, occur solitarily or in pairs, on very short\r\npeduncles, and mature in one season. They are small, deeply enclosed in\r\na relatively heavy cup, thin toward the outer end.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD of Mohrs oak is not of economic importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     DURAND OAK (Durand White Oak)\r\n                        Quercus durandii Buckl.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis oak is found on the well-drained soil of river bottoms from the\r\ncoast region of East Texas to the bottoms of the Guadalupe River\r\n(Victoria County) and inland to San Saba County, and the Dallas area.\r\n\r\nIt forms a tree 60 to 90 feet high with a tall trunk 2 to 3 feet in\r\ndiameter; comparatively small branches, the lower horizontal, the upper\r\nascending, forming a dense, round-topped, handsome head.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: DURAND OAK (Leaves and fruit, one-half natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe BARK is thin, light gray or nearly white and broken into loose\r\nappressed scales.\r\n\r\nThe deciduous LEAVES are 2½ to 7 inches long, yellow-green, thin, smooth\r\non the edges, three-lobed toward the tip, or irregularly lobed, the\r\nthree forms appearing on different branches of the same tree.\r\n\r\nThe FRUIT, an acorn, solitary or in pairs on a very short peduncle, is\r\nnearly egg-shaped, pale chestnut-brown, shinning, ½ to ¾ inch long, and\r\nbarely enclosed at the base in the thin saucer-shaped cup. The acorn\r\nmatures in one season.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is hard and heavy and is used largely as fuel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               WHITE OAK\r\n                            Quercus alba L.\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin its natural range, which includes practically the entire eastern\r\nhalf of the United States, the white oak is one of the most important\r\ntimber trees. Found in East Texas to the Brazos River, it commonly\r\nreaches a height of 80 feet and a diameter of 3 feet. It is found on\r\nhigh quality soils. Grown in a dense stand it has a long, straight\r\ntrunk, free of side branches for over half of its height. In the open,\r\nit develops a short trunk and broad crown with far-reaching limbs.\r\n\r\nThe BARK is thin, light ashy gray and covered with loose scales or broad\r\nplates.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: WHITE OAK (Twig, one-half natural size; leaf and fruit,\r\n                        one-third natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe deciduous LEAVES are alternate, simple, 5 to 9 inches long and about\r\nhalf as broad. They are deeply divided into 5 to 9 rounded, finger-like\r\nlobes. The young leaves are a soft silvery-gray or yellow or red while\r\nunfolding, later becoming bright green and lustrous or dull above and\r\nmuch paler and glaucous below. The FRUIT, an acorn maturing in one\r\nseason, is ¾ to 1 inch long, light brown, and about one-fourth enclosed\r\nin a warty cup. The acorn is relished by hogs and other livestock.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is heavy, strong, hard, tough, close-grained, durable, and\r\nlight brown in color. The uses are many, including construction,\r\nwatertight barrels, furniture, wagons, implements, interior finish,\r\nflooring, and fuel. Although white oak is slow growing, it is valuable\r\nfor forest, highway and ornamental planting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                POST OAK\r\n                       Quercus stellata Wangenh.\r\n\r\n\r\nPost oak of Texas is usually a medium-sized tree, with a rounded crown,\r\ncommonly reaching a height of 50 feet and a diameter of 1 foot, but\r\nsometimes considerably larger. It is the common oak in Central Texas and\r\noccurs frequently in East Texas. It occurs most abundantly on the poorer\r\nupland soils that have poor drainage.\r\n\r\nThe deciduous LEAVES are usually 4 to 5 inches long and nearly as broad,\r\ndeeply five-lobed with broad rounded divisions, the lobes broadest at\r\nthe ends. They are thick and somewhat leathery, dark green and shiny on\r\nthe upper surface, lighter green and rough hairy beneath.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: POST OAK (Leaf and twig, one-third natural size; fruit,\r\n                       one-fourth natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe FLOWERS, like those of the other oaks, are of two kinds on the same\r\ntree, the male in drooping clustered catkins, the female inconspicuous.\r\nThe FRUIT, an oval acorn ½ to 1 inch long, is set in a rather small cup\r\nwhich has thin scales and may or may not be stalked. The fruit matures\r\nin one season.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is heavy, hard, close-grained, light to dark brown, and durable\r\nin contact with the soil. It is used for crossties and fence posts, and\r\noccasionally for furniture and lumber.\r\n\r\nAside from the typical form, two varieties are found in the state. The\r\nvariety margaretta (Ashe) Sarg. is the common post oak of eastern Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        BUR OAK (Mossy-Cup Oak)\r\n                       Quercus macrocarpa Michx.\r\n\r\n\r\nBur oak occurs throughout the eastern part of the state and as far west\r\nas Callahan and Menard Counties, in rich bottomlands along streams, or\r\non rich hillsides along spring-fed rivers. The name alludes to the\r\nfringe around the cup of the acorn, which is sometimes large. The tree\r\nusually has a broad top of heavy spreading branches and a relatively\r\nshort body. In maturity it attains a diameter of 5 feet or more and a\r\nheight of over 80 feet.\r\n\r\nThe branches frequently have conspicuous corky ridges after the second\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: BUR OAK (Illustrations, one-third natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe BARK is light gray and is usually broken up into small narrow\r\nflakes. The deciduous LEAVES resemble somewhat those of the common white\r\noak, but are much larger and have a pair of deep indentations on their\r\nborder near the base, and wavy notches on the broad, middle and upper\r\nportions of the leaf. They range from 6 to 12 inches long and 3 to 6\r\ninches wide. The FRUIT, or acorn, is set deeply in the fringed cup. The\r\nfruit is usually 1 inch or more in diameter but varies widely in respect\r\nto size and the degree to which the nut is enclosed in the mossy-fringed\r\ncup. The fruit matures in one season.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is heavy, hard, strong, tough and durable. It is used for much\r\nthe same purposes as the other white oaks—for lumber, crossties, and\r\nfuel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              OVERCUP OAK\r\n                          Quercus lyrata Walt.\r\n\r\n\r\nOvercup oak, sometimes known as the swamp post oak or water white oak,\r\nbecomes a large tree with small, often pendulous branches. It is found\r\nin moist, rich bottomlands in East Texas to the Navasota River Valley.\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are deciduous, 7 to 9 inches long, 1 to 4 inches broad,\r\noblong, wider toward the point, narrowed at the base, dark green above,\r\noften whitish beneath, with 7 to 9 distinct pointed lobes. They\r\nfrequently turn to a bright scarlet or to scarlet and orange in the\r\nfall. The BARK is rough, flaky, and gray tinged with red.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: OVERCUP OAK (Leaf and fruit, one-third natural size;\r\n                    twig, two-thirds natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe FLOWERS open with the unfolding of the leaves. The FRUIT, an acorn,\r\nripens in one season. The large rounded or somewhat flattened acorn, an\r\ninch or more across and ½ to 1 inch high, is nearly covered by the ovate\r\nor nearly spherical cup, which is thickened at the base but gradually\r\ngrows thinner, often irregularly split at the margin of the cup.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is heavy, hard, strong, and durable and is used for the same\r\npurposes as that of white oak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           SWAMP CHESTNUT OAK\r\n                        Quercus michauxii Nutt.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis species, also called basket oak and cow oak, is distinguished by\r\nhaving a wavy leaf-margin, a large fruit which is sessile or very short\r\nstalked, and by the fact that it occurs in its greatest abundance in\r\nbottomlands. It is confined chiefly to the eastern part of the state as\r\nfar west as the Trinity River.\r\n\r\nIn the appearance of its bark and branches it closely resembles the\r\nordinary white oak, but the leaf lacks deep indentations and the acorn\r\nis usually larger. The tree attains heights of about 100 feet and\r\ndiameters of about 4 feet.\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are deciduous, obovate or oblong ovate, notched on the edge\r\nsomewhat like the chinkapin oak, but the lobes are rounded instead of\r\npointed. They vary from 4 to 8 inches in length, are downy beneath and\r\nturn a rich crimson in the fall. The BARK is very light gray, and on old\r\ntrees is broken into broad flakes or divided into strips.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: SWAMP CHESTNUT OAK (Twig, one-half natural size; fruit\r\n                   and leaf, one-third natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe acorn, or FRUIT, matures in one season and attains a diameter of\r\nmore than an inch and a length of 1½ inches. The acorn is a bright,\r\nshiny brown and set in a rather shallow cup. The acorn is frequently\r\neaten by cows and this fact gives the tree one of its common names.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is heavy, hard, tough, strong, and takes an excellent polish.\r\nIt is used in manufacturing lumber, veneer, boards (shakes), water-tight\r\nbarrels, fuel, fence posts, and baskets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHINKAPIN OAK\r\n                      Quercus muhlenbergii Engelm.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis oak, also known as chestnut oak, occurs over the eastern part of\r\nthe state and west to the Guadalupe River; also on the Guadalupe\r\nMountains. It grows on most classes of soils, except in swamps, and is\r\ntenacious on shallow, dry, limestone soil. The BARK is light gray, and\r\nbreaks up in the short narrow flakes on the main trunk and old limbs.\r\n\r\nIt reaches a height of 20 to 50 feet. The straight, shapely trunk bears\r\na round-topped head composed of small branches, which makes it an\r\nattractive shade tree.\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are deciduous, oblong, 3 to 6 inches in length, 1½ to 3\r\ninches wide, equally toothed or notched on the edges, resembling the\r\nleaves of chestnut oak. The FRUIT, which ripens in the fall of the first\r\nseason, is light to dark brown when ripe, and edible if roasted. This\r\nacorn is ½ to nearly 1 inch long, usually less than 1 inch in diameter,\r\nand set in a shallow cup.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is heavy, hard, strong, durable, and takes an excellent polish.\r\nIt is used for barrels, fencing, crossties, fuel, and occasionally for\r\nfurniture.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: CHINKAPIN OAK (Leaf, one-half natural size; twig and\r\n                    fruit, one-third natural size)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        AMERICAN ELM (White Elm)\r\n                           Ulmus americana L.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe range of this famous American shade tree extends west to the Dakotas\r\nand southward to Coke County, Texas. Within this vast area, it is\r\ngenerally common except in the high mountains and wet bottomlands. It\r\nreaches an average height of 60 feet and a diameter of 3 feet. The BARK\r\nis dark gray, divided into irregular flat-topped, thick ridges, and is\r\ngenerally firm. An incision into an outer ridge of bark will show\r\nalternate brown and cream colored layers. A cross section of slippery\r\nelm bark is uniformly cream or tan colored.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: AMERICAN ELM (Twig, one-half natural size; leaf and\r\n                    fruit, one-third natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are alternate, simple, 4 to 6 inches long, rather thick,\r\nsomewhat lopsided, double toothed on the margin, and either smooth or\r\nscabrous above and soft pubescent or glabrate below. The leaf veins are\r\nvery pronounced and run in parallel lines from the midrib to the leaf\r\nmargin.\r\n\r\nThe FLOWERS are small, perfect, greenish, on slender pedicels, soon\r\npendulous, and appear before the leaves. The FRUIT ripens in the spring\r\nand is a light green, oval-shaped samara (winged fruit) with the seed\r\nportion in the center and surrounded entirely by a wing. A deep notch in\r\nthe end of the wing is distinctive of the species.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is heavy, hard, strong, tough, and difficult to split. It is\r\nused for hubs of wheels, saddle trees, veneer for baskets and crates,\r\nand slack cooperage.\r\n\r\nAmerican elm is rapidly being destroyed in the East and Midwest by the\r\nDutch elm disease and by phloem necrosis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               WINGED ELM\r\n                           Ulmus alata Michx.\r\n\r\n\r\nWinged elm gets its common name from the thin corky growth or “wings”,\r\nusually found on smaller branches. These “wings” generally end abruptly\r\nat the leaf nodes as contrasted by the cedar elm (p. 63) whose “wings”\r\nare generally continuous. On large rapidly growing trees the wings are\r\noften absent. It occurs in eastern Texas south to the valley of the\r\nGuadalupe River, on dry uplands, and in moist soils along streams and\r\nswamps. It grows rapidly in moist situations, and may also be planted\r\nalong roadsides in relatively dry, poor locations. It is comparatively\r\nfree from disease, though not long-lived. Winged elm is a medium-sized\r\ntree 40 to 50 feet in height and rarely as large as 2 feet in diameter.\r\nIt forms a rather open, round-topped head.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: WINGED ELM (Leaf and fruit, one-third natural size;\r\n                     twig, one-half natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe BARK is light brown tinged with red, and divided by irregular\r\nshallow fissures into flat ridges.\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are simple alternate, 2 to 4 inches long and 1 to 2 inches\r\nbroad, coarsely double-toothed, thick, dark green and smooth above, and\r\npale and pale-pubescent or glabrous below with auxiliary hairs and\r\nprominent veins. The leaves are small and pointed at the tip, which\r\ndistinguishes them from the small blunt leaves of the cedar elm.\r\n\r\nThe FLOWERS appear in early spring, long before the leaves unfold. The\r\nFRUIT ripens in the spring about the time the leaves appear; it is\r\nwinged, tipped with two, small, incurved arms or beaks; oblong,\r\nreddish-brown; about ⅓ inch long, with a long, slender pedicel at the\r\nbase, and covered with white hairs.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is very similar to that of the other elms—heavy, hard, and\r\ndifficult to split. It is occasionally used for hubs and mauls.\r\nFormerly, rope made of the inner bark was used for binding the covers to\r\ncotton bales.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CEDAR ELM\r\n                        Ulmus crassifolia Nutt.\r\n\r\n\r\nCedar elm is distributed widely over the state, near streams, in deep\r\nrich soil, and on dry, limestone hills. It is the most common elm tree\r\nof Texas, extending to the Pecos River. It forms a tree up to 75 feet\r\nhigh with a tall straight trunk 2 to 3 feet in diameter, and with an\r\ninversely conic round-topped head and drooping branches. It reaches its\r\nlargest size on the bottomlands of the Guadalupe and Trinity Rivers.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: CEDAR ELM (Illustrations, three-fourths natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe BARK is light-brown tinged with red, deeply fissured, with\r\nflattened, scaly ridges. The young twigs are finely velvet and reddish,\r\nsometimes developing thin corky wings which continue around the leaf\r\nnodes.\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are small, the largest less than 2 inches long, often double\r\ntoothed and usually rather blunt at the tip. Their upper surface is dark\r\ngreen and rough, while the lower surface and petiole are hairy.\r\n\r\nThe FLOWERS, which appear in the autumn, are in small short-pedicelled\r\nclusters at the axils of the leaves. The FRUIT, an oval-shaped samara\r\nslightly more than ¼ inch long, is hairy all over, especially on the\r\nedges and is deeply notched at the tip.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is reddish-brown, brittle, and with a thick layer of lighter\r\ncolored sapwood. The wood is sometimes used in the manufacture of hubs,\r\nfurniture, and fencing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SLIPPERY ELM (Red Elm)\r\n                           Ulmus rubra Muhl.\r\n\r\n\r\nSlippery elm, or red elm, is found in the eastern and southern parts of\r\nthe state as far as the upper Guadalupe and Leon Rivers in Kerr and\r\nComal Counties. It is found principally on the banks of streams and on\r\nlow hillsides in rich soil. It is a tree of small to moderate size, but\r\nnoticeably wide-spreading. It is usually less than 40 feet in height and\r\n6 inches in diameter, although trees of larger dimensions are\r\noccasionally found.\r\n\r\nThe BARK on the trunk is frequently 1 inch thick, dark grayish-brown on\r\nthe surface, uniformly tan or cream colored in cross section, and broken\r\nby shallow fissures into flat ridges. The inner bark is used to some\r\nextent for medicinal purposes and, when chewed, affords a slippery\r\nmucilaginous substance, whence the tree gets its name.\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are simple, alternate on the stem, 4 to 6 inches in length,\r\nsharp-pointed, their bases unsymmetrical, doubly toothed on the edges,\r\nthick, dark green, and very rough above, pubescent below.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: SLIPPERY ELM (Leaf and fruit, one-third natural size;\r\n                     twig, one-half natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe FLOWERS appear in early spring and are nearly sessile. The FRUIT, a\r\nsamara, ¾ inch long and ½ inch in diameter, consists of a seed\r\nsurrounded by a thin, broad, greenish wing. The fruit ripens when the\r\nleaves are about half grown. The margin of the fruit is not ciliate.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is close-grained, tough, strong, heavy, hard, and moderately\r\ndurable in contact with the soil. Slippery elm and American elm are sold\r\ncommercially as “soft elm,” and have similar uses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        PLANER TREE (Water Elm)\r\n                     Planera aquatica (Walt.) Gmel.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlaner tree or water elm is found on low wet lands along the streams of\r\nthe eastern part of the state as far west as Brazos and Matagorda\r\nCounties. It forms a small spreading tree with a low broad head 30 to 40\r\nfeet in height and with a maximum trunk diameter of 20 inches.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PLANER TREE (Illustrations, nearly natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe BARK is light brown or gray, about ¼ inch thick, and separates into\r\nlarge scales.\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES resemble those of the small-leaved elms. They are 2 to 2½\r\ninches long, ¾ to 1 inch wide on a short petiole, dark dull green above\r\nand paler on the lower surface, and have yellowish veins.\r\n\r\nThe FLOWERS appear with the leaves in March or early April. The small\r\nflowers are sometimes perfect; occasionally the male and female flowers\r\nare borne separately on the same tree. The FRUIT is a peculiar, rounded,\r\nshaggy-appearing structure, about ⅜ inch long. It consists of a nut-like\r\ncenter covered with soft and irregular wing-like outgrowths which extend\r\nout on all sides from the center.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is light brown, coarse-grained and soft, very light in weight,\r\nand has a broad zone of nearly white sapwood. The wood has little\r\neconomic value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               HACKBERRY\r\n                         Celtis occidentalis L.\r\n\r\n\r\nHackberry is found over eastern Texas on various types of soil. It is\r\nusually a medium-sized to large tree, becoming 60 to 100 feet or more\r\nhigh and 10 to 20 inches in diameter. Its limbs are often crooked and\r\nangular and bear a head made of slender, pendant branches or short,\r\nbristly, stubby twigs. In the open, the crown is generally symmetrical.\r\nIt makes an excellent shade tree.\r\n\r\nThe BARK is brownish-gray, one inch or more thick, and generally very\r\nrough with many scale-like or warty projections of dead bark.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: HACKBERRY (Leaf and fruit, two-thirds natural size;\r\n                     twig, one-half natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are simple, ovate, alternate, one-sided, 2 to 4 inches long,\r\nthick, very rough above, green on both surfaces, and the edges toothed\r\ntoward the long point. The FLOWERS are inconspicuous, and the two kinds\r\nare borne on the same tree. They appear in April or May, and are of a\r\ncreamy greenish color. The FRUIT is a round, somewhat oblong, drupe or\r\nberry, dark purple, ⅓ inch in diameter, ripening in September. The\r\npeduncle (fruit stem) is much longer than the petiole of the leaf. It\r\nhas a thin, purplish skin, and sweet yellowish flesh. The berries\r\nfrequently hang on the tree most of the winter.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is heavy, rather soft, weak, and decays readily when exposed.\r\nIt is used chiefly for fuel, and occasionally for lumber.\r\n\r\nThe range of this hackberry extends far into the northern and\r\nnortheastern parts of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SUGARBERRY (Sugar Hackberry)\r\n                        Celtis laevigata Willd.\r\n\r\n\r\nSugarberry is distributed widely over the eastern half of the state. It\r\noccurs most abundantly and attains greatest size in rich alluvial soil,\r\nbut thrives on various soil types. The species may grow 30 to 50 feet\r\nhigh and 10 to 20 inches in diameter, though sometimes much larger. Its\r\nlimbs are spreading or pendulous, forming a broad head. Its branchlets\r\nare slender, light green, glabrous or pubescent when young, and bright\r\nreddish-brown during their first winter.\r\n\r\nThe BARK is pale gray and covered with prominent excrescences.\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are simple, oblong-lanceolate, one-sided, 2½ to 5 inches\r\nlong, thin, smooth, with the edges entire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUGARBERRY (Leaf, fruit, and twig, three-fourths natural\r\n                                 size)]\r\n\r\nThe FLOWERS, not conspicuous, are borne on slender, smooth peduncles in\r\nApril or May, and are of a creamy-greenish color. The FRUIT is\r\nshort-oblong to pear shaped, orange-red or yellow, ¼ inch in diameter,\r\nand ripens in September. The peduncle of the fruit is shorter or\r\nslightly longer than the petiole of the leaf.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is soft, weak, close-grained, and light yellow, and is used\r\noccasionally for flooring and furniture, but chiefly for fuel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RED MULBERRY\r\n                             Morus rubra L.\r\n\r\n\r\nRed mulberry occurs in eastern Texas and west to the canyon of Devils\r\nRiver, Valverde County. It prefers rich moist soils. It is a small tree,\r\nrarely 50 feet high and 2 feet in diameter, often growing in the shade\r\nof larger trees.\r\n\r\nThe BARK is rather thin, dark grayish-brown, and peels off in long\r\nnarrow flakes.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: RED MULBERRY (Twig, two-thirds natural size; leaves and\r\n                    fruit, one-third natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are alternate, thin, rounded or somewhat heart-shaped,\r\ntoothed, pointed, 3 to 5 inches long, rough hairy above and soft hairy\r\nbeneath. Some of the leaves are mitten-shaped or lobed.\r\n\r\nThe FLOWERS are of two kinds, on the same or different trees, in long\r\ndrooping catkins, the female catkins shorter, appearing with the leaves.\r\n\r\nThe multiple FRUIT is edible, dark purple or black when ripe, and ¾ to 1\r\ninch long.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is rather light, soft, not strong, light orange-yellow, and the\r\nheartwood is durable in contact with the soil. It is chiefly used for\r\nfence posts.\r\n\r\nThe TEXAS MULBERRY (Morus microphylla Buckl.) is found in West Texas and\r\nsouth from the Colorado River. Its leaves are rarely longer than 1½\r\ninches.\r\n\r\nThe WHITE MULBERRY (Morus alba L.) a native of China, has become\r\nnaturalized in the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       OSAGE-ORANGE (Bois-d’arc)\r\n                    Maclura pomifera (Raf.) Schneid.\r\n\r\n\r\nOsage-orange, “bodark”, hedge apple, or mock orange is native to eastern\r\nand Central Texas; attaining its largest size in the valley of the Red\r\nRiver in the northeast part of the state. It commonly reaches a height\r\nof 20 to 40 feet and a diameter of 4 to 12 inches. The BARK is thin,\r\ngray, sometimes tinged with yellow; on old trees it is divided into\r\nstrips or flakes. It contains tannin and has been used for tanning\r\nleather. The twigs are armed with stout, straight thorns ⅜ to 1 inch\r\nlong.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: OSAGE-ORANGE (Leaf and fruit, one-fourth natural size;\r\n             leaf and twig, nearly one-half natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are simple, alternate, oval-pointed and lustrous green on the\r\nupper surface, 3 to 5 inches long and 2 to 3 inches wide, and entire.\r\nThe leaves turn bright yellow in the autumn.\r\n\r\nThe yellowish FLOWERS appear in May; two kinds on the same tree—the male\r\nflowers in a linear cluster and the female flowers a rounded ball. The\r\nFRUIT is globular, from 2 to 5 inches in diameter, resembling a rough,\r\ngreen orange.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is heavy, exceedingly hard, very strong, and very durable in\r\ncontact with the soil. The heartwood is bright orange in color, turning\r\nbrown upon exposure. It is largely used for posts. The Indians prized\r\nthe wood for bows and war clubs. The tree is planted for windbreaks and\r\nhedges. The bark of the roots supply a yellow dye.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 SOUTHERN MAGNOLIA (Evergreen Magnolia)\r\n                        Magnolia grandiflora L.\r\n\r\n\r\nMagnolia is one of the best-known trees in the eastern part of the\r\nstate. No other tree excels it in the combined beauty of leaves and\r\nflowers. Occurring naturally in rich moist soil on the borders of river\r\nswamps and nearby uplands in the Coastal Plain to the valley of the\r\nBrazos River, it has been widely cultivated for its ornamental value. In\r\nits natural habitat, it attains heights generally of 60 to 80 feet and\r\ntrunk diameters up to 4 feet. The dense pyramidal head, or crown, is\r\nmade up of numerous small spreading branches and branchlets.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: SOUTHERN MAGNOLIA (Leaf and flower, one-fourth natural\r\n                  size; twig, one-half natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are evergreen, thick, leathery, elliptical or oval, dark\r\ngreen and shiny above, rusty or silvery beneath, and mostly from 5 to 8\r\ninches long, and 2 to 3 inches wide, with prominent midribs. They remain\r\non the tree for approximately 2 years.\r\n\r\nThe large FLOWERS are 6 to 8 inches broad, with pure white petals\r\nsurrounding a splash of bright purple in the center, and have a pleasing\r\nfragrance.\r\n\r\nThe FRUIT is a rounded or oval aggregate 3 to 4 inches long containing\r\nmany seeds, each enclosed in a follicle. These open in the fall and\r\ndisplay the bright red seeds dangling on slender threads.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is moderately heavy, hard, and of a creamy color. It is used\r\nchiefly for furniture, Venetian blinds, and fuel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SWEETBAY (Sweetbay Magnolia)\r\n                         Magnolia virginiana L.\r\n\r\n\r\nSweetbay, better known locally as white or swampbay, is found in the\r\nsouthern part of the Texas pine belt to western Montgomery County, in\r\nswamps and rich, moist soils.

It is found near streams in the extreme east portion\r\nof the state and in greater abundance in Harrison and Grayson Counties.\r\nIt is seldom over 30 feet high with a trunk 8 or 10 inches in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe BARK on young trees and branches is a smooth, clean brown; on older\r\ntrees becoming blotched with gray, and bearing a few small wart-like\r\nexcrescences.\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are obovate—lanceolate, 8 to 12 inches long, light, bright\r\ngreen above and paler below.\r\n\r\nThe FLOWERS are strikingly characteristic. The three light green, hairy\r\nsepals are early deciduous. The outer three petals are a rich\r\nbrownish-purple and deeply veined. The inner three petals are pointed,\r\nglandular, and erect.\r\n\r\nThe FRUIT is an oblong berry 3 to 6 inches long, and contains a number\r\nof large, brown seeds. When ripe it falls to the ground, turning dark\r\nbrown. The deep yellow flesh is palatable, though some people do not\r\ncare for its unique flavor. The tree blooms and bears as a shrub or\r\ntree.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is light, weak, and spongy, yellow in color, and is of no known\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: PAWPAW (Leaf, one-fourth natural size; twig, two-thirds\r\n                             natural size)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 REDBAY\r\n                      Persea borbonia (L.)

It is common in Texas west to the\r\nBrazos River on the drier soils, and is one of the first broad-leaved\r\ntrees to grow on abandoned fields, where the seeds are dropped by birds.\r\nThe species is closely related to the camphor tree of Japan. The BARK is\r\nred-brown and deeply furrowed while the bark of the twigs is bright\r\ngreen.\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are unusual in that they vary widely in shape on the same\r\ntree, or even on the same twig. Some are oval and entire, 4 to 6 inches\r\nlong; others have one lobe, resembling a mitten; while still others are\r\ndivided at the outer end into 3 distinct lobes.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: SASSAFRAS (Twig, one-half natural size; leaf and fruit,\r\n                        one-third natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe FLOWERS are clustered, greenish-yellow, and open with the first\r\nunfolding of the leaves. The male and female flowers are usually on\r\ndifferent trees. The FRUIT is an oblong, dark blue or black lustrous\r\ndrupe surrounded at the base by what appears to be a small orange-red or\r\nscarlet cup at the end of the scarlet peduncle.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is light, soft, weak, brittle, and durable in the soil; the\r\nheartwood is dull orange-brown. It is used for posts and crossties. The\r\nbark of the roots yields the very aromatic oil of sassafras much used\r\nfor flavoring candies and various commercial products. The bark of the\r\nroot is sold in small bundles for making sassafras tea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              WITCH-HAZEL\r\n                        Hamamelis virginiana L.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis tall-growing shrub which has the peculiar habit of blooming in the\r\nlate fall and ripening its fruit in early spring is native to the\r\nextreme eastern portion of Texas, being found on rich soils of streams\r\nor along the borders of the forest.\r\n\r\nThe BARK is smooth, white, gray, and mottled with light brown.\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are usually obovate, 3 to 5 inches long, prominently veined,\r\nwith a wavy margin, very irregular at the base, bright green above and\r\nslightly paler below. They are generally smooth.\r\n\r\nThe odd, yellow FLOWERS are borne in clusters along the branch, with\r\nlong, very narrow twisted petals. They develop during November,\r\nDecember, and January, the time depending somewhat on the weather, and\r\npossess a refreshing fragrance. The FRUIT is a hard, tough, two-celled\r\ncapsule, with two beaks. It divides in half, each half containing a\r\nshiny black seed. In the late summer or early autumn the capsules pop\r\nopen, discharging the seeds.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: WITCH-HAZEL (Leaf, one-half natural size; flower and\r\n                         fruit, natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is hard and close-grained. The trees do not grow large enough\r\nto be of commercial value.\r\n\r\nAn analgesic extract used in lotions and balms is obtained from the\r\ninner bark by distillation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           SWEETGUM (Redgum)\r\n                       Liquidambar styraciflua L.\r\n\r\n\r\nSweetgum is a valuable and sometimes troublesome forest tree in East\r\nTexas. It occurs on rich river bottoms and in swamps subject to frequent\r\noverflow, as well as on the dried uplands, as far west as the San\r\nJacinto River Basin. The BARK is a light gray, roughened by corky\r\nscales, later becoming deeply furrowed. After the second year the twigs\r\noften develop corky projections of bark, which give them a winged\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nThe simple, alternate star-shaped LEAF with its 5 to 7 points or lobes,\r\nis 5 to 7 inches across and aromatic. In the fall its coloring ranges\r\nfrom pale yellow through orange and red to a deep bronze.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: SWEETGUM (Leaf and fruit, one-third natural size; twig,\r\n                       two-thirds natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe FLOWERS of both sexes appear on the same tree and open with the\r\nleaves. The FRUIT, a head an inch or more in diameter, is made up of\r\nmany capsules with projecting spines. It hangs on the tree late into the\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is moderately hard, close-grained, and not durable on exposure.\r\nThe reddish-brown heartwood, which suggests the name red gum, is not\r\npresent to any appreciable extent in logs under 16 inches in diameter.\r\nThe wood is extensively used for flooring, interior finish, paper pulp,\r\nand veneers for baskets of all kinds.\r\n\r\nIn the uplands, this species competes aggressively with the more\r\nvaluable Southern pines. The control of sweetgum is, therefore, a\r\nproblem. This attractive species should be more widely planted for\r\nornamental use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           AMERICAN SYCAMORE\r\n                       Plantanus occidentalis L.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmerican sycamore, also called planetree and buttonwood, is considered\r\nthe largest hardwood tree in North America. It occurs throughout eastern\r\nTexas to Zavalla County. It is most abundant and reaches its largest\r\nsize along streams and on rich bottomlands. It grows rapidly and\r\noccasionally attains a height of 140 to 170 feet and a diameter of 10 to\r\n11 feet.\r\n\r\nThe BARK of the sycamore is a characteristic feature; on the younger\r\ntrunk and large limbs it is smooth, greenish-gray in color. The outer\r\nbark of limbs and upper trunk flakes off in large patches and exposes\r\nthe nearly white younger bark. Near the base of old trees, the bark\r\nbecomes thick, dark brown and divided by deep furrows.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: AMERICAN SYCAMORE (Fruit and leaf, one-third natural\r\n                                 size)]\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are simple, alternate, 4 to 7 inches long and about as broad;\r\nlight green and smooth above, and paler below. The base of the petiole\r\nis hollow and in falling off exposes the winter bud. The multiple FRUIT\r\nforms a ball about 1 inch in diameter, which hangs on its flexible\r\npeduncle—3 to 5 inches long. During early spring the fruit ball breaks\r\nup, and the small nutlets are scattered widely by the wind.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is hard and moderately strong, but decays rapidly in the\r\nground. It is used for butchers’ blocks, tobacco boxes, furniture, and\r\ninterior finish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             HAWTHORN (Haw)\r\n                              Crataegus L.\r\n\r\n\r\nHawthorn, as treated here, represents about 30 different species and\r\nvarieties distributed throughout the state. Members of the group occur\r\non the poorest and richest soils, on the shallowest and deepest, and on\r\nthe limestone hills as well as on the rich bottom and swamp lands. Most\r\nof the forms have a common likeness in possessing thorns and bearing\r\nwhite blossoms and red or yellow fruit. Some species are planted as\r\nornamental trees, but otherwise the group is of little commercial value.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HAWTHORN (Leaf and twig, two-thirds natural size; fruit,\r\n                        one-half natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe BARK is generally thin, gray in color, and on the old stems broken\r\nup into thin, narrow scales.\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are simple, alternate, mostly oval or wedge-shaped, notched\r\non the edges, and usually from 2 to 3 inches long.\r\n\r\nThe FLOWERS are white, some fragrant and others with a slightly\r\nunpleasant odor; they appear in early spring. The FRUIT varies from\r\nglobular to oblong, from ¼ to ¾ inch in diameter; some when ripe have a\r\npulpy, sweet, edible flesh, surrounding from 1 to 5 bony seeds.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is strong, tough, heavy, hard, but rarely used for any purpose.\r\n\r\nMany species of birds are attracted to these trees and bushes by the\r\nfruit and for the protection offered for nesting. Blueberry hawthorn, C.\r\nbrachyacanthu, fruit ripens in the late summer and is valuable for deer\r\nfood. The fruit of most species ripens in the fall, and one or two\r\nvarieties yield a fruit highly prized for making jelly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      RIVERFLAT HAWTHORN (Mayhew)\r\n                     Crataegus opaca Hook. and Arn.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis species is a native of East Texas, being found as far west as the\r\nTrinity River. It grows along rivers at the edges of swamps and ponds,\r\nwhere water stands a part of the year. These trees often form extensive\r\nthickets. The FRUIT of this haw, unlike other Texas haws, matures in\r\nlate April or May. After the fruit is gone, it is more difficult to\r\ndistinguish it from other haws. It is of low, spreading habit, sometimes\r\nbecoming a tree 20 to 30 feet high and about a foot in diameter. It\r\nusually bears a few thorns about 1 inch long on branches two years old.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RIVERFLAT HAWTHORN (Leaves, flowers, and fruit, one-half\r\n                             natural size)]\r\n\r\nOn old trees the BARK is deeply fissured and divided into dark brown,\r\npersistent scales. The wood has no commercial value.\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are about 2 inches long, pointed, narrowing toward the stem,\r\nfinely toothed from the middle of the tip, sometimes slightly lobed,\r\ndull green, and rather downy beneath.\r\n\r\nThe FLOWERS appearing in March are the largest of Crataegus, 1 inch in\r\ndiameter, white, and borne in clusters of only 2 or 3. The FRUIT, an\r\nunusually large haw, is sometimes nearly an inch in diameter. When fully\r\nripe, these haws are scarlet, lustrous, mellow, and pleasantly acid. The\r\nfruit is gathered in large quantities for making mayhaw jelly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              MEXICAN PLUM\r\n                        Prunus mexicana S. Wats.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis common wild plum is a small tree reaching 20 to 25 feet in height\r\nand 8 to 10 inches in diameter. Uncommonly it attains only large shrub\r\nsize.\r\n\r\nThe BARK is dark, varying from gray to nearly black. There are curling\r\nscales on young branches but on old trunks the bark becomes rough and\r\ndeeply furrowed.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: MEXICAN PLUM (Leaf, three-fourths natural size; flowers\r\n                   and fruit, one-half natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES, when mature, are alternate, oval, abruptly pointed, finely\r\nand doubly toothed along the margin, dark yellow-green, smooth and\r\nshiny, thick and firm, 2 to 3 inches long by 1 to 2 inches wide,\r\nnarrowed or rounded at the base and prominently veined on both surfaces.\r\n\r\nThe white FLOWERS appear in numerous small clusters in March before the\r\nleaves. With a profusion of flowers, this tree is one of the delights of\r\nearly spring in the woods. The FRUIT, or plum, which ripens in late\r\nsummer, is dark purple-red color with a bluish “bloom”, about 1¼ inches\r\nin diameter, and varies widely in its palatability. The stone is about ¾\r\ninch long, and smooth. The dorsal edge is ridged; the ventral edge\r\ngrooved.\r\n\r\nThis species of plum does not sucker to form thickets, is drought\r\nresistant, and has been used for grafting stock for the production of\r\ncommercial plums.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      FLATWOODS PLUM (Black Sloe)\r\n                         Prunus umbellata Ell.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis shrub or small tree with a short, often crooked, or inclining trunk\r\nand a flat-topped head and slender branches is rarely over 20 feet high.\r\nBranchlets at first covered with a dense, pale pubescence, soon become\r\nsmooth and bright red during the first year and dull dark brown the\r\nsecond year. It occurs throughout the eastern portion of the state.\r\n\r\n        [Illustration: FLATWOODS PLUM (Two-thirds natural size)]\r\n\r\nBARK ¼ inch thick, dark brown, almost black, and broken diagonally into\r\nsmall, hard, appressed, persistent scales. LEAVES bright bronze-green\r\nwith red margins and petiole when they unfold; at maturity, usually less\r\nthan 2½ inches long, ovate-lanceolate to oblong with a rounded or\r\nslightly cordate base; leaf thin, dark green above, paler below; usually\r\nfurnished with two large dark glands at the base; margins finely and\r\nsharply serrate with incurved teeth.\r\n\r\nSmall white FLOWERS appearing in umbels of 3 or 4 flowers before the\r\nleaves. Flowers ⅔ inch in diameter. FRUIT a drupe on a stem ½ to 1 inch\r\nlong, round, ½ inch in diameter, and with a tough, black, yellow, or\r\nbright red skin covered with a glaucous bloom, and with thick, acid\r\nflesh. Stone flattened, brittle-walled, and wrinkled. Dorsal edge\r\ngrooved; ventral edge with conspicuous ridge. The fruit is relished by\r\ndeer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              BLACK CHERRY\r\n                         Prunus serotina Ehrh.\r\n\r\n\r\nA medium-sized tree, up to about 70 feet high and 1 to 3 feet in\r\ndiameter, black cherry is found in eastern Texas and in the mountains of\r\nWest Texas. The forest-grown trees have long clear trunks with little\r\ntaper. Open-grown trees have short trunks with many branches and\r\nirregular spreading crowns. The BARK on branches and young trunks is\r\nsmooth and bright reddish-brown, marked by conspicuous, narrow, white,\r\nhorizontal lines, and has a bitter almond taste. On the older trunks the\r\nbark becomes rough and broken into thick, irregular plates.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: BLACK CHERRY (Leaf and fruit, one-third natural size;\r\n                    twig, two-thirds natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are alternate, simple, oval to lance-like in shape, 2 to 6\r\ninches long and 1-1½ inches wide, with fine, incurved serrations, shiny\r\nabove, and paler beneath. Cattle eating wilted leaves may be fatally\r\npoisoned.\r\n\r\nThe FRUIT is a dull purplish-black drupe, about as large as a pea, and\r\nis borne in long hanging panicles. The fruit ripens in late summer, is\r\nedible though slightly bitter, and is relished by wildlife.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is reddish-brown with yellowish sapwood, moderately heavy,\r\nhard, strong, fine-grained, and does not warp or split in seasoning.\r\nWith the exception of black walnut, cherry lumber has a greater unit\r\nvalue than any other hardwood of the eastern United States. Cherry is\r\nprized for furniture.\r\n\r\nThe SOUTHWESTERN BLACK CHERRY, Prunus serotina var. rufula (Woot. and\r\nStandl.) McVaugh is found in the Guadalupe Mountains of West Texas. At\r\nleast five other cherry species are native to Texas. All have shrubby\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         CAROLINA LAURELCHERRY\r\n                    Prunus caroliniana (Mill.) Ait.\r\n\r\n\r\nCalled by many local names such as cherry laurel, wild peach, and mock\r\norange, this species is native to the eastern portion of the state to\r\nthe valley of the Guadalupe River, where it is found on deep rich moist\r\nbottomlands. It is apparently free from disease and quite adaptable for\r\nlandscape planting. It is usually a small tree but sometimes reaches a\r\nheight of 50 to 60 feet and 18 inches in diameter when cultivated. The\r\npartially withered leaves and young branches can be fatal to animals\r\nbrowsing upon them, owing to presence of poisonous hydrocyanic acid.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: CAROLINA LAURELCHERRY (Two-thirds natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe BARK is rather smooth, gray, and marked by almost black blotches.\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are persistent, oblong-lanceolate, with a few tiny sharp\r\nteeth along the margins, dark lustrous green above, paler below. They\r\ncling until the second year.\r\n\r\nThe small white FLOWERS come in clusters, in early spring. The FRUIT, a\r\nlustrous black drupe, ripens in autumn, and clings until the following\r\nspring. The fruit is eaten by some birds.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is heavy, hard, strong, close-grained, rich brown in color,\r\nwith a thick, lighter colored sapwood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     EBONY BLACKBEAD (Texas Ebony)\r\n               Pithecellobium flexicaule (Benth.) Coult.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis beautiful evergreen occurs as a small tree or shrub in South Texas\r\nfrom Matagorda Bay and south into Mexico. Its short spreading branches,\r\nforming a wide, round head, carry stout zigzag brachlets, dark\r\nreddish-brown or light gray, armed with persistent stipular spines ¼ to\r\n½ inch long.\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES, about 2 inches long, are feather-like (twice pinnate) with\r\nsessile, leathery leaflets that are dark green and shiny on the upper\r\nsurface, paler on the lower surface, and ¼ to ⅓ inch long.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EBONY BLACKBEAD (Leaf and fruit, two-thirds natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe FLOWERS are light yellow or cream colored, fragrant, and bloom from\r\nJune to August in dense cylindric or interrupted spikes 1½ inches long.\r\n\r\nThe FRUIT ripens in the fall and remains on the branches until after the\r\nflowering season the following year. It is a flattened, curved, hairy\r\npod, 4 to 6 inches long, and about 1 inch wide.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is very heavy, hard, close-grained, dark red-brown tinged with\r\npurple, almost indestructible when used for fence posts, and valued for\r\ncabinet work.\r\n\r\nThe tree is considered the most valuable species in the lower Rio Grande\r\nValley. Mexicans use the seed as a substitute for coffee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      CATCLAW ACACIA (Una de Gato)\r\n                         Acacia greggii A. Gray\r\n\r\n\r\nFound on dry gravelly mesas, the sides of low canyons and the banks of\r\nmountain streams in the Rio Grande Valley and westward, this small tree\r\nrarely reaches a height of 30 feet, and has a trunk up to 12 inches in\r\ndiameter. The top or head consists of numerous spreading branches and\r\nsmooth pale brown or red branchlets, armed with stout curved spines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CATCLAW ACACIA (Fruit and leaves, one-half natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe small, bipinnately compound LEAVES with 1 to 3 pinnae, the leaflets\r\nof which are about ¼ inch long.\r\n\r\nThe fragrant yellow FLOWERS appear during the summer in dense, oblong,\r\npubescent spikes, usually 2 to 3 in a cluster at the end of a branch.\r\n\r\nThe FRUIT matures by midsummer into a twisted or distorted pod, 2 to 4\r\ninches long by about ¾ inch wide. The pod is smaller between each of the\r\n6 to 8 seeds, which are nearly round, flattened, dark brown and shiny.\r\nThe pods hang unopened on the branches until the winter or the following\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is heavy, hard, strong, close-grained, durable, and clear brown\r\nor red in color.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             GREGG LEADTREE\r\n                       Leucaena greggii S. Wats.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis small, beautiful tree grows wild in western Texas from the upper\r\nSan Saba River to Devil’s River. It grows along the banks of streams and\r\nin moist ravines, and reaches a size of 15 to 20 feet in height and 4 to\r\n5 inches in diameter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GREGG LEADTREE (Leaf and fruit, two-thirds natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are finely and doubly compound; with 10 to 14 feather-like\r\npinnae, each containing from 30 to 60 small leaflets, arranged along\r\nopposite sides of the rachis. Each leaflet is elliptical, grayish-green\r\nor bluish-green, smooth, and about ⅓ inch long.\r\n\r\nThe white FLOWERS are clustered in dense round heads, about 1 inch in\r\ndiameter, borne on a long peduncle. Each tiny flower has protruding\r\nhairs which give the head a fuzzy appearance.\r\n\r\nThe pods, or FRUIT, are 6 to 8 inches long and about ½ inch wide, flat,\r\nand with narrow wing-like edges.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is heavy, hard, close-grained, clear brown streaked with red,\r\nwith thin, clear sapwood.\r\n\r\nTwo other species of mimosa are found in Texas: L. pulverulenta\r\n(Schlect.)

Cockerell\r\n\r\n\r\nThis well-known small tree is found in the central and western part of\r\nthe state. The short trunk, usually only 6 to 8 inches in diameter,\r\ndivides into many branches forming a loose, open top or crown.\r\n\r\nThe root system is very large, consisting of a thick taproot sometimes\r\nextending downward to a depth of 30 to 40 feet, with many radiating\r\nroots.\r\n\r\n        [Illustration: HONEY MESQUITE (One-fourth natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are pinnately compound, consisting of 12 to 20 leaflets\r\nattached along a central rachis, or “stem”, 8 to 10 inches long. The\r\nleaflets are often 2 inches long, smooth, dark green, and pointed. Near\r\ntheir bases are small spines.\r\n\r\nThe fragrant FLOWERS are tiny and in clusters (spikes) from 2 to 4\r\ninches long. The FRUIT is a pod about 4 to 9 inches, narrowed between\r\neach of the 10 to 20 seeds enclosed in a thick sweet pulp, used by the\r\nnatives as food and eagerly sought by wildlife and livestock.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is heavy, hard, and dark reddish-brown in color. It is much\r\nused for fuel and, because it is durable in the ground, for fence posts.\r\n\r\nMesquite has long been designated as P. juliflora (Sw.) D.C., with the\r\nvarieties glandulosa (Torr.) Cockerell and velutina (Woot.) Sarg. found\r\nin Texas.\r\n\r\nWESTERN HONEY MESQUITE (P. juliflora var. torreyana L. Benson) occurs in\r\nsouthern and Trans-Pecos regions of Texas. This species is usually a\r\nshrub or sometimes a small tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             EASTERN REDBUD\r\n                          Cercis canadensis L.\r\n\r\n\r\nEastern Redbud, sometimes called Judas-tree from its oriental relative\r\nof that name, is a small tree scattered through the woods of East Texas\r\nto the Brazos River. It attains a height of 25 to 50 feet and a diameter\r\nof 6 to 12 inches. Its stout branches usually form a wide flat head.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EASTERN REDBUD (Twig, two-thirds natural size; fruit and\r\n                     leaf, one-third natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe BARK of the trunk is divided into long narrow plates, the bright\r\nred-brown surface separating into thin scales.\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are alternate, heart-shaped, entire, 3 to 5 inches long and\r\nwide, glossy green, turning a bright clear yellow in autumn.\r\n\r\nThe conspicuous, bright purplish-red FLOWERS are in clusters along the\r\ntwigs and small branches, and appear before or with the leaves in early\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nThe FRUIT is an oblong, flattened, many-seeded pod, 2 to 4 inches long,\r\nreddish during the summer and often hanging on the tree through the\r\nfollowing summer.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is heavy, hard, not strong, rich dark brown in color, and of\r\nlittle commercial importance. The redbud is cultivated as an ornamental\r\ntree and for that purpose might be more generally planted in this state.\r\n\r\nSeveral varieties of Cercis canadensis have been described in Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              HONEYLOCUST\r\n                        Gleditsia triacanthos L.\r\n\r\n\r\nHoneylocust occurs naturally in the eastern part of the state to the\r\nBrazos River. It grows under a wide variety of soil and moisture\r\nconditions and is a popular tree for planting in the drier portions of\r\nTexas. It reaches a diameter of 30 inches and a height of 75 feet. The\r\nBARK on old trees is dark gray and is divided into thin, tight scales.\r\nThe strong, straight or branched, brown, sharp and shiny thorns, which\r\ngrow on the 1-year-old wood and remain for many years, are sufficient to\r\nidentify the honeylocust.\r\n\r\nThe LEAF is pinnate or feather-like, with 18 to 28 leaflets; or it is\r\nbi-pinnate, consisting of 4 to 7 pairs of pinnae, each 6 to 8 inches\r\nlong.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: HONEYLOCUST (Twig, three-quarters natural size; leaves\r\n                 and fruit, one-quarter natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe FRUIT, a 10 to 18 inch pod, is often twisted, 1 to 1½ inches wide,\r\nflat, dark brown or black when ripe, and contains a yellow sweetish pulp\r\nand dark brown seeds. The seeds are hard and separated by pulp. The pods\r\nare eaten by many animals, and as the seeds are hard to digest, many are\r\nwidely scattered from the parent tree.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is coarse-grained, hard, strong, and moderately durable in\r\ncontact with the ground.\r\n\r\nHoneylocust is a good tree to substitute for the black locust which has\r\nbeen almost exterminated in West Texas by the locust borer.\r\n\r\nTEXAS HONEYLOCUST (G. texana Sarg.), found in the Brazos River\r\nbottomlands, is reported to be a hybrid between G. triacanthos and G.\r\naquatica.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              WATERLOCUST\r\n                       Gleditsia aquatica Marsh.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn river bottoms and swamps along the Gulf Coast to the Brazos River and\r\nnorth to Arkansas is found the waterlocust, a close relative of the\r\nwell-known black locust. It can be distinguished by the small pod having\r\none seed, rarely two or three.\r\n\r\n          [Illustration: WATERLOCUST (One-half natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe waterlocust reaches a height of 60 feet and diameter up to 3 feet.\r\nThe trunk is usually short, dividing into several spreading, and often\r\ndistorted, branches. The branchlets have sharp spines from 3 to 5 inches\r\nin length, dark red and shiny.\r\n\r\nThe pinnately compound LEAVES are 5 to 8 inches long with 12 to 20\r\nleaflets arranged on opposite sides of the leaf rachis. Each leaflet is\r\nan inch or so in length, oblong, sometimes slightly toothed on the edge,\r\ndull green or yellow-green above and dark green on the lower surface.\r\n\r\nThe FLOWERS appear in small clusters of green flowers on purple pedicels\r\nin a raceme 3 to 4 inches long, and grow from the axil of the leaf\r\nrachis and twig. The flowers bloom well after the leaves are out. The\r\nFRUIT pods hang in graceful racemes. The pods are 1 inch wide and 1 to 2\r\ninches long, thin walled, tough, papery, chestnut brown, and shiny. The\r\nSEEDS are flattened, nearly round, about ½ inch wide, and orange-brown.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is heavy, hard, strong, light reddish-brown, and surrounded by\r\na wide band of clear yellow sapwood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      BLACK LOCUST (Yellow Locust)\r\n                        Robinia pseudoacacia L.\r\n\r\n\r\nBlack locust is not native to Texas, so far as known, but has been\r\nwidely planted here and has escaped from cultivation. Black locust\r\nrequires deep, well-drained, moist soil for good growth. It grows\r\nindifferently to poorly on well-drained, dry sites. Of late years it has\r\nbeen severely damaged by the locust borer and is no longer recommended\r\nfor planting in pure stands.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: BLACK LOCUST (Leaf and fruit, one-third natural size;\r\n                    twig, two-thirds natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe twigs and branchlets are armed with paired, straight or slightly\r\ncurved, sharp, strong spines, sometimes as much as 1 inch in length,\r\nwhich remain attached to the outer bark for many years.\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are pinnate, or feather-like, from 6 to 10 inches long, with\r\n7 to 19 oblong, thin leaflets.\r\n\r\nThe FLOWERS are fragrant, white or cream-colored, and appear in graceful\r\npendant racemes.\r\n\r\nThe FRUIT is a pod from 3 to 5 inches long containing 4 to 8 small hard\r\nseeds which ripen late in the fall. The pod splits open during the\r\nwinter, discharging most of the seeds. Some seeds usually remain\r\nattached to each half of the pod.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is yellow, coarse-grained, heavy, very hard, strong, and\r\ndurable in contact with the soil. It is used extensively for fence\r\nposts, poles, tree nails, insulator pins, and occasionally for lumber\r\nand fuel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      HERCULES-CLUB (Prickly-Ash)\r\n                     Zanthoxylum clava-herculis L.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis tree is a native of East Texas and ranges westerly to the valley of\r\nthe Colorado River and northward to Dallas and Tarrant Counties, and to\r\nsome extent to the Rio Grande Valley. It is a small tree, seldom over 30\r\nfeet in height, with a short trunk usually under 1 foot in diameter. It\r\nseems to prefer a well-drained, light, sandy soil, and is often found\r\ngrowing on bluffs near rivers.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: HERCULES-CLUB (Leaf and fruit, one-half natural size;\r\n                         spines natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe BARK is the most characteristic feature of this tree. It is gray,\r\nand with numerous corky tubercles. The aromatic inner bark, with its\r\nstrong pungent juice, has given this tree a number of local names, such\r\nas “tingle-tongue”, and “toothache tree.” The inner bark was a favorite\r\nin old-time home remedies for the relief of toothache.\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are compound, 5 to 8 inches long, with 7 to 17 ovate,\r\ntoothed, bright green leaflets.\r\n\r\nThe small, pale green FLOWERS, borne in loose, wide-branched cymes, 4 to\r\n5 inches long and 2 to 3 inches wide, bloom in early spring when the\r\nleaves are almost half grown. The small FRUIT, a one-seeded carpel,\r\nripens in early summer. The seeds hang outside the carpels and are eaten\r\nby birds.\r\n\r\nThe soft, light brown WOOD has no special known value.\r\n\r\nA variety, fruiticosum (A. Gray) S. Wats., is a shrubby form found in\r\nWest Texas. It has short, often 3-foliate, pubescent leaves and blunt,\r\nleathery leaflets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       COMMON HOPTREE (Wafer-Ash)\r\n                          Ptelea trifoliata L.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis small tree or large shrub is found scattered over the eastern\r\nportion of the state. The bark and leaves are bitter and strong-scented\r\nand possess tonic qualities.\r\n\r\nThe hoptree has a straight, slender trunk 6 to 8 inches in diameter and\r\nseldom reaches a height of more than 20 feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMON HOPTREE (Fruit, three-fourths natural size; leaf,\r\n                        one-third natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are composed of 3 leaflets, sometimes 5, each of which is\r\noval or pear-shaped and pointed, about 4 to 6 inches long and 2 to 3\r\ninches wide, and dark green on the upper surface. The central leaflet is\r\nthe largest.\r\n\r\nThe FRUIT consists of a small, round, 2-seeded, winged “key” or\r\n“samara”, resembling somewhat the familiar paper caps for toy pistols.\r\nThe seeds occur in dense drooping clusters and hang on the tree over\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is heavy, hard, yellowish-brown, and close-grained. The shrub\r\nis often planted as an ornamental.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                SHINING SUMAC (Dwarf or Flameleaf Sumac)\r\n                           Rhus copallina L.\r\n\r\n\r\nShining sumac is found growing naturally west to the San Antonio River.\r\nIt is more commonly a shrub than a tree and grows in clumps and thickets\r\naround the edges of the fields and in other open places. The leaves turn\r\ncrimson in the fall and add a vivid note to the autumn coloring. The\r\ntree spreads by means of shallow root-runners.\r\n\r\nThe BARK is almost smooth, with horizontal splashes of light and dark\r\ngray, and many small excrescences. This papery outer bark cracks at\r\nirregular intervals, exposing spots of reddish-brown beneath.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: SHINING SUMAC (Leaf and fruit one-half natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe compound LEAVES are alternate, 6 to 8 inches long, with 9 to 21\r\nsmall ovate-lanceolate leaflets, glossy green above, downy beneath. This\r\nsumac is easily distinguished from others by the fact that the leaf\r\nrachis is winged. The leaves are rich in tannin, and are used in large\r\nquantities for curing leather, and for the manufacture of dyes.\r\n\r\nThe tiny, pale green FLOWERS are borne in compact conical, panicles in\r\nJuly. Male and female flowers are borne on separate trees. The small\r\nFRUIT is red, covered with short hairs, and has an acid taste. The\r\nfruits cling, and are eaten by birds in late winter.\r\n\r\nThe reddish-brown WOOD is soft, light, and coarse-grained.\r\n\r\nPRAIRIE SUMAC (R. lanceolata [A. Gray] Britton) is found on the prairies\r\nof eastern Texas to the valley of the Rio Grande, often forming thickets\r\non the banks of small streams. This species is distinguished by its\r\nnarrow, acute leaflets and its larger flowers and fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              POISON-SUMAC\r\n                   Toxicodendron vernix (L.) Kountze\r\n\r\n\r\nAll parts of this beautiful plant give off toxic oils that may irritate\r\nand blister the skin like the oils of poison ivy. Poison-sumac may grow\r\nas a shrub with several clustered stems, or as a tree occasionally 25\r\nfeet high with a trunk 5 to 6 inches in diameter. The slender, smooth\r\nbranchlets are at first reddish-brown with orange-colored lenticels,\r\nlater becoming light gray and marked with elevated and conspicuous\r\nleaf-scars.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: POISON-SUMAC (Leaf, one-half natural size; fruit often\r\n                                larger)]\r\n\r\nThe compound, alternate LEAVES are quite different from those of other\r\nsumacs, shaped more like those of ash, for which reason it is often\r\ncalled “poison ash.” The leaf-stems are always reddish, and usually\r\nquite conspicuous. The leaves are 7 to 14 inches long, with 7 to 13\r\novate-oblong leaflets, 3 to 4 inches long. The leaflets are bright green\r\nabove, paler beneath, usually with a red midrib.\r\n\r\nThe small FLOWERS are borne in panicles much less compact than those of\r\nother sumacs. The FRUIT is a lustrous white drupe, born in slender,\r\ndrooping panicles. The fruit matures in September and is eaten by birds\r\nand rabbits. The sap can be used to make a black, durable varnish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             AMERICAN HOLLY\r\n                            Ilex opaca Ait.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmerican holly is found on rich, moist soils of bottomlands in East\r\nTexas and westward to Wilson County. A tree often 50 feet high,\r\nfrequently attains heights of 80 to 100 feet and diameters up to 4 feet.\r\nA large specimen may be seen at the Texas Forest Service’s Indian Mound\r\nNursery near Alto.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AMERICAN HOLLY (Leaf and fruit, two-thirds natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe BARK is light gray and roughened by wart-like growths. The numerous,\r\nshort, slender branches form a dense pyramidal head of striking dark\r\ngreen color which is more pronounced when the conspicuous red drupes are\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are simple, alternate, rather oval, thick and leathery, 2 to\r\n4 inches long and usually armed with spiny teeth. They remain on the\r\nbranches three years, dropping off in the spring.\r\n\r\nThe FLOWERS are small and whitish; male and female flowers are usually\r\nborne on separate trees. The FRUIT, ripening late in the fall on the\r\ntrees bearing female flowers, is dull red or sometimes yellow, round or\r\nsomewhat oval-shaped berry-like drupe about ¼ inch in diameter and with\r\n4 to 6 grooved, ribbed nutlets.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is light, tough, not strong, white when cut, turning brown when\r\naged. Valued and much used for cabinet making, interior finish, and\r\nturnery. Many of the largest and best holly trees have been cut and\r\nmarketed.\r\n\r\nHolly is a highly desirable Christmas decoration and a desirable\r\nornamental tree for yards. Wild holly is becoming scarce. Excessive\r\ncuttings should be avoided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 YAUPON\r\n                          Ilex vomitoria Ait.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis close relative of the American holly is found in East Texas to\r\nMatagorda Bay, Rio Blanco and the Guadalupe River, and north to southern\r\nArkansas. On the rich bottomlands of eastern Texas, yaupon is a small\r\ntree, 20 to 25 feet high with a trunk rarely over 6 inches in diameter;\r\nelsewhere it is a shrub.\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are 1 to 2 inches long, ¼ to 1 inch wide, thick, glossy green\r\nabove, paler below, and persistent for 2 or 3 years.\r\n\r\n            [Illustration: YAUPON (Two-thirds natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe FLOWERS, male and female, are borne on separate plants. The FRUIT, a\r\nscarlet berry-like drupe, is produced in great abundance by the female\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is of little value except for fuel.\r\n\r\nYaupon is used in the South as a hedge plant, and is much prized for\r\nChristmas decorations. A tea made from leaves was once popular with the\r\nIndians. The plant is now grown on the Atlantic Coast for the commercial\r\nproduction of yaupon tea for medicinal purposes.\r\n\r\nI. decidua Walt. known as POSSUM HAW (WINTER BERRY) is similar to\r\nyaupon, but the leaves shed in the fall; the fruits, which remain over\r\nwinter, are orange to orange-scarlet in color.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SILVER MAPLE\r\n                          Acer saccharinum L.\r\n\r\n\r\nSilver, or soft, maple is found on moist land and along streams in the\r\nextreme eastern part of the state. In its best region of growth, the\r\nvalley of the lower Ohio River, it attains heights of 100 feet or more\r\nand diameters of 3 feet or over.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: SILVER MAPLE (Twig and fruit, one-half natural size;\r\n                     leaf, one-third natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe BARK on old trunks is dark gray and broken into long flakes or\r\nscales. The twigs are slender, brittle, reddish-brown, and shiny.\r\n\r\nThe buds are rounded, red or reddish-brown, blunt-pointed, generally\r\nlike those of red maple.\r\n\r\nThe simple, opposite LEAVES have from 3 to 5 lobes ending in long points\r\nwith toothed margins and separated by deep angular sinuses or openings;\r\nthe leaves are pale green on the upper surface, silvery-white\r\nunderneath, and have a red petiole.\r\n\r\nThe FLOWERS arising from the large prominent flower buds are a\r\ngreenish-yellow color and appear in clusters in the spring before the\r\nleaves. The FRUIT ripens in the spring and consists of a pair of wing\r\nsamaras or “keys” with wings 1 to 2 inches long on a slender, flexible,\r\nthread-like peduncle about an inch long.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is soft, weak, even-textured, rather brittle, easily worked,\r\nand decays readily when exposed. It is occasionally used for flooring,\r\nfurniture and fuel.\r\n\r\nThe silver maple grows rapidly and has been planted in Texas as a shade\r\ntree. It is somewhat undesirable because of its brittleness and\r\nsusceptibility to insects and fungus diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               RED MAPLE\r\n                             Acer rubrum L.\r\n\r\n\r\nRed maple is abundant in low moist areas in the eastern part of the\r\nstate. It is usually a medium-sized tree, quick-growing, and relatively\r\nshort-lived. It is used as a shade tree, though of inferior quality for\r\nthis purpose. The BARK is smooth and light gray on young limbs and\r\ntrunks, and dark gray and rough on old limbs and trunks.\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are 2 to 5 inches long and have from 3 to 5 pointed,\r\nsaw-toothed lobes separated by sharp angular sinuses or openings. The\r\nupper leaf surface when mature is light green, the lower surface whitish\r\nand partly covered with pale down. In autumn the leaves turn to\r\nbrilliant shades of red, orange, and yellow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RED MAPLE (Leaf and fruit, one-third natural size; twig,\r\n                        one-half natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe red FLOWERS appear in dense clusters in early spring before the\r\nleaves, the buds turning a deep red sometimes before they open. The\r\nwinter buds are small, red, and round or blunt-pointed. The FRUIT ripens\r\nin the late spring or early summer. It consists of pairs of winged\r\nsamaras, or keys, ½ to 1 inch in length, on a long drooping peduncle\r\n(fruit stem), red, reddish-brown, or yellow in color.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD, known commercially as soft maple, is heavy, close-grained,\r\nrather weak, and of a light brown color. It is used in the manufacture\r\nof furniture, and for turnery, woodenware, and fuel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                BOXELDER\r\n                            Acer negundo L.\r\n\r\n\r\nBoxelder, the only Texas maple with compound leaves, is a native of\r\neastern and southern Texas to the lower Rio Blanco River. It is\r\ngenerally found on the banks of streams and lakes and the borders of\r\nswamps. It grows rapidly, making a quick shade, and is quite shapely.\r\nThe branches are brittle and break easily. The tree is short-lived and\r\nrather subject to disease. It sometimes attains a height of 50 to 60\r\nfeet, with a trunk 2 feet in diameter, but is usually smaller.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: BOXELDER (Leaf and fruit, one-third natural size; twig,\r\n                       two-thirds natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe BARK of the twigs is green; of the trunk grayish-brown, divided into\r\nbroad, rounded ridges, and separating on the surface into short, thick\r\nscales.\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are opposite, compound, usually with 5 leaflets, occasionally\r\n3 or 7. The leaflets are 2 to 4 inches long, coarsely and irregularly\r\ntoothed, light green above, paler beneath.\r\n\r\nThe tiny FLOWERS are borne in drooping clusters. The FRUIT is like that\r\nof the other maples, green, turning light tan when mature. Unlike the\r\nseeds of other maples, they cling until after the leaves are shed.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is creamy-white, light, and soft and weak but close-grained. It\r\nis sometimes used in other states for the manufacture of low grade\r\nfurniture and interior finish; it is also used for woodenware,\r\ncooperage, and paper pulp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              OHIO BUCKEYE\r\n                         Aesculus glabra Willd.\r\n\r\n\r\nOhio buckeye occurs as far west as eastern Texas along streams in rich\r\nsoils. Though often only a shrub, it becomes a medium-sized tree in rich\r\nalluvial bottoms. Its leaves and fruit are poisonous to stock.\r\n\r\nThe BARK is white and, on old trees, divided or broken into light brown\r\nflat scales, which make the stems of the tree rough; the bark is\r\nill-smelling when bruised.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: OHIO BUCKEYE (Twig, two-thirds natural size; nut,\r\n        one-third natural size; leaf, one-fourth natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are opposite, palmately compounded, with 5 to 7 smooth, pale\r\ngreen leaflets, ill-smelling when bruised. The leaves usually turn\r\nyellow during the summer.\r\n\r\nThe FLOWERS are cream-colored and appear in clusters, 5 to 8 inches\r\nlong, in April or May.\r\n\r\nThe FRUIT is generally rounded, pale brown, generally thin-walled,\r\nroughened with blunt prickles or warts, and breaking into 2 to 3 valves,\r\ndisclosing the bright shiny seeds 1 to 1½ inches wide.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is light, soft and weak, and decays rapidly when exposed. It is\r\nused for woodenware, artificial limbs, paper pulp, lumber, and fuel.\r\n\r\nAesculus pavia L., the RED BUCKEYE, is found as a shrub in Comal and\r\nWilson Counties and is common through eastern Texas to Bexar and Kendall\r\nCounties, as a shrub 9 to 12 inches high.

It ranges through eastern Texas to New\r\nMexico and the Rio Grande, becoming a tree 40 to 50 feet high and 1 to 2\r\nfeet in diameter, with usually erect branches, and branchlets at first\r\nslightly many-angled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WESTERN SOAPBERRY (Leaf, two-fifths natural size; fruit,\r\n                        one-third natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe BARK is broken by deep fissures into long narrow plates which in\r\nturn are broken on the surface into small red-brown scales.\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES appearing in March or April, bear 4 to 9 pairs of alternate,\r\nopposite or both, lance-shaped leaflets which are pale, yellow-green,\r\nabout 2½ inches long and ½ to ⅔ inch wide. The leaves fall in autumn or\r\nearly winter.\r\n\r\nThe FLOWERS are whitish, in large, dense panicles.\r\n\r\nThe FRUIT, round yellow berries, ½ inch in diameter, and containing dark\r\nbrown seeds, ripen in September and October and fall in the spring.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is heavy, strong, close-grained, light brown tinged with\r\nyellow. It splits easily into thin strips and is used for cotton basket\r\nand the frames of pack saddles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  AMERICAN BASSWOOD (American Linden)\r\n                           Tilia americana L.\r\n\r\n\r\nThree species of basswood are reported to grow in Texas from the\r\nArkansas line to the Brazos River and westward to Uvalde, Kerr and\r\nBandera Counties, usually on rich, moist soils. They are rarely over 50\r\nfeet tall and 12 inches in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe BARK is light brown and deeply furrowed.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: AMERICAN BASSWOOD (Leaf and fruit, one-third natural\r\n                  size; twig, one-half natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are more or less heart-shaped, 3 to 6 inches long, thin,\r\nsaw-toothed, smooth on both sides in some species, but woolly on the\r\nunder surface of others.\r\n\r\nThe fragrant FLOWERS, a favorite of bees, are yellowish-white, in\r\ndrooping clusters opening in early summer, and the flower-stem is united\r\nto the middle of a long, narrow, leaf-like bract.\r\n\r\nThe FRUIT, a dry, 1 to 2-seeded nut-like drupe, ¼ to ½ inch in diameter,\r\nis covered with short, thick, gray-brown wool. It remains attached in\r\nclusters to the leafy bract, which later acts as a wing to bear the\r\nfruit away in the wind.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is light, soft, tough, not durable, and light brown in color.\r\nIt is used in states where the growth is better for the manufacture of\r\npulp, woodenware, furniture, trunks, excelsior, and many other articles.\r\nThe principal use of basswoods in Texas is for shade and ornament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  DEVILS-WALKINGSTICK (Hercules-Club)\r\n                           Aralia spinosa L.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis tree, a native of Northeast Texas, is armed from the ground up with\r\nmany sharp spines, a characteristic that has given the tree many names\r\nsuch as Hercules-club, prickly-elder, and prickly-ash. The last name\r\nproperly belongs to another tree. Devils-walkingstick possesses\r\nsufficient beauty to compensate for its spitefulness. The tree is\r\nusually small, but occasionally attains a height of 30 feet, the leaves\r\nforming a flat-topped, spreading crown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DEVILS-WALKINGSTICK (Branch, one-half natural size; leaf\r\n                      and fruit greatly reduced)]\r\n\r\nThe brown BARK is divided by broad shallow fissures into circular,\r\nhorizontal ridges. The sharp spines along its trunk best identify this\r\ntree.\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are doubly compounded, or bi-pinnate, the main rachis\r\n(leaf-stem) 3 or 4 feet long, clasping the stem with an enlarged base,\r\nand leaving conspicuous scars when they fall. The oval leaflets are\r\ntoothed, pointed, dark green above and paler beneath. They turn yellow\r\nin autumn.\r\n\r\nIn mid-summer each plant bears one immense panicle of small, white\r\nFLOWERS, which rises well above the leaves. The tree presents its most\r\nstriking appearance in autumn when the small black FRUIT ripens, for the\r\nfruit-stems turn a rich wine-red. Birds eat the juicy drupes. The WOOD\r\nis of no commercial importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        BLACK TUPELO (Blackgum)\r\n                         Nyssa sylvatica Marsh.\r\n\r\n\r\nBlack gum, often called sour gum, is found in eastern Texas to the\r\nvalley of the Brazos River; usually in swampy wet soil, but sometimes on\r\ndry slopes with the oaks.\r\n\r\nThe BARK on younger trees is furrowed between flat ridges, and gradually\r\ndevelops into quadrangular blocks that are dense, hard, and nearly\r\nblack.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: BLACK TUPELO (Twig, leaf, and fruit one-half natural\r\n                                 size)]\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are simple, 2 to 3 inches long, entire, obovate to elliptic,\r\nshiny, and dark green in color. In the fall the leaves turn brilliant\r\nred.\r\n\r\nThe greenish FLOWERS on long, slender peduncles appear in early spring\r\nwhen the leaves are about one-third grown. They are usually of two\r\nkinds, the male in many-flowered heads, and the female in two or\r\nseveral-flowered clusters on different trees. The FRUIT is drupe-like,\r\ndark blue ⅔ inch long, containing a single hard-shelled stone, and is\r\nborne 2 to 3 in a cluster on 1 to 2½-inch peduncles.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is very tough, cross-grained, not durable in contact with the\r\nsoil, hard to work, and warps easily. Once considered a weed tree, the\r\nspecies is now valuable for basket veneer, box boards, and paper pulp.\r\nIn the old days, the hollow trunks were used for “bee-gums.”\r\n\r\nSwamp tupelo (N. s. var. biflora [Walt.] Sarg.), found mainly on the\r\nCoastal Plain, has narrowly obovate to narrowly oblanceolate leaves and\r\nfruiting peduncles ⅜ to 1⅜ inches long. The base of the trunk is swollen\r\nwhen submerged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                WATER TUPELO (Cotton-Gum or Tupelo-Gum)\r\n                           Nyssa aquatica L.\r\n\r\n\r\nWater tupelo is found only in deep river swamps or coastal swamps which\r\nare often flooded. The commonly enlarged base, large-sized fruit,\r\nhanging on a long peduncle (stem), and the brittleness of the twigs,\r\nserve to distinguish this species from the black gum. It forms a tall,\r\noften slowly tapering somewhat crooked trunk 50 to 75 feet in height and\r\n2 to 3 feet in diameter. The spreading small branches form a narrow,\r\noblong or pyramidal head. The branches are generally smooth and light\r\nbrown in color. The BARK of the trunk is thin, dark brown and furrowed\r\nup and down the trunk.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: WATER TUPELO (Leaf and fruit, one-third natural size;\r\n                    twig, two-thirds natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are simple, ovate or oblong in shape, acute and often\r\nlong-pointed. When mature they are thick, dark green and lustrous on the\r\nupper side, pale and somewhat downy on the lower side, 5 to 7 inches\r\nlong and 2 to 4 inches wide, wedge-shaped at the base, and entire or\r\nirregularly toothed on the margin. The petiole is stout, 1 to 2 inches\r\nlong, grooved, and enlarged at the base.\r\n\r\nThe FLOWERS, which appear in March or April are of two kinds, usually\r\nborne on separate trees, the male flowers in dense round clusters, and\r\nthe female flowers solitary.\r\n\r\nThe FRUIT, ripening in early fall, is a dark purple drupe, oblong or\r\nobovate in shape, about 1 inch long, with a thick, tough skin enclosing\r\na flattened stone, and borne on a slender peduncle 3 to 4 inches long.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is light, soft, and not strong. It is used for woodenware,\r\nbroom handles, fruit and vegetable baskets, marketed as tupelo or bay\r\npoplar lumber, and paper pulp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           FLOWERING DOGWOOD\r\n                           Cornus florida L.\r\n\r\n\r\nDogwood grows in the forests of eastern Texas, usually under the larger\r\nforest trees. It is a small tree, up to 30 feet high and 12 inches in\r\ndiameter, occasionally larger, with a rather flat and spreading crown\r\nand short, often crooked trunk.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FLOWERING DOGWOOD (Leaf and fruit, one-half natural\r\n                 size; twig, two-thirds natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe BARK is reddish-brown to black and broken up into small 4-sided,\r\nscaly blocks.\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are opposite, ovate, 3 to 5 inches long, 2 to 3 inches wide,\r\npointed, entire or wavy on the margin, prominently veined, bright green\r\nabove, pale green or grayish beneath.\r\n\r\nThe FLOWERS, which unfold from the conspicuous, round, grayish, winter\r\nflower buds before the leaves come out, are small, greenish-yellow,\r\narranged in dense heads surrounded by large white or pinkish petal-like\r\nbracts, which appear like large spreading flowers 2 to 4 inches across.\r\n\r\nThe FRUIT is a bright scarlet drupe one-half an inch long and containing\r\na hard, two-celled nutlet containing 1 or 2 seeds. Usually several\r\nfruits are contained in one head, and are relished by birds, squirrels,\r\nand other animals.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is hard, heavy, strong, close-grained, and brown to red in\r\ncolor. It is in demand for cotton-mill machinery, turnery, handles, and\r\nforms.\r\n\r\nWith its masses of early spring flowers, its dark red autumn foliage,\r\nand bright red berries, dogwood is probably our most ornamental native\r\ntree. It should be used more extensively in eastern Texas for ornamental\r\nplanting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    TREE SPARKLEBERRY (Farkleberry)\r\n                       Vaccinium arboreum Marsh.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the coastal belt of eastern Texas as far as Matagorda Bay,\r\nfarkleberry, or tree huckleberry, grows in moist sandy soil along the\r\nbanks of ponds and streams. Although it is found from Virginia to\r\nMissouri and southward, it reaches its largest size, 20 to 30 feet, near\r\nthe Gulf Coast of Texas. The crooked trunk may attain a diameter of 8 to\r\n10 inches. Further inland it is a large shrub.\r\n\r\n        [Illustration: TREE SPARKLEBERRY (Nearly natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are oval and glossy green, varying up to 2 inches in length\r\nand 1 inch in width. They are mostly evergreen, or at least persist on\r\nthe twigs during the winter.\r\n\r\nThe FLOWERS are small, white, and bell-shaped, and appear in long open\r\nclusters on racemes.\r\n\r\nThe FRUIT consist of small, round, shiny, nearly black berries which\r\nripen in the fall and, unless eaten by birds or animals, remain until\r\nspring. They have a slightly puckering but pleasing flavor.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is heavy, hard, close-grained, and light reddish-brown. It is\r\nsometimes used for tool handles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               GUM BUMELIA (Woolly Buckthorn—Gum-Elastic)\r\n                   Bumelia lanuginosa (Michx.) Pers.\r\n\r\n\r\nGum bumelia, often called false buckthorn or chittamwood, occurs along\r\nstreams in sandy woods in eastern Texas to the San Antonio River and\r\nover the Edwards Plateau to Palo Pinto County. It reaches its largest\r\ndevelopment probably in Central Texas where it occasionally grows as a\r\ntree 80 feet high and 3 feet in diameter.\r\n\r\n        [Illustration: GUM BUMELIA (Three-fourths natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe branches are short, stout, and stiff, and often armed with straight\r\nor curved spines.\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are oblong, more or less grouped near the ends of short\r\nspurs; rounded at the apex, narrowed at the base; thick, firm, dark\r\ngreen and shiny above, and rusty-woolly beneath. They are from 1 to more\r\nthan 2 inches long and up to ¾ inch wide.\r\n\r\nThe FLOWERS are small and open in summer, each borne on a hairy\r\nflower-stem (pedicel) about ⅛ inch long. They are borne in fascicles of\r\n15 to 18, near the axils of the new leaves or near the leaf-scars of old\r\nleaves. The petals are white and lobed. The fruit is fleshy, black,\r\noblong, about ½ inch in length, borne singly or in a cluster of 2 or 3,\r\nand usually dry and firm on the outside and contain a light brown, firm\r\nrounded seed. The ripe fruit falls from the tree in autumn.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is light brown streaked with white and surrounded by a band of\r\nlighter colored sapwood. It is heavy, hard, and close-grained.\r\n\r\nB. lanuginosa var. Rigida A. Gray, is found in western and southern\r\nTexas, while B. lycioides L. Pers., is found in eastern Texas to Milam\r\nCounty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            COMMON PERSIMMON\r\n                        Diospyros virginiana L.\r\n\r\n\r\nPersimmon is a well known tree throughout its range. It is small, rarely\r\nexceeding 50 feet in height and 18 inches in diameter, occurring in the\r\nstate as far west as the Colorado River. It prefers dry, open\r\nsituations, and is most abundant in old fields, though it occurs on rich\r\nbottomlands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMON PERSIMMON (Leaf and fruit, one-half natural size;\r\n                   twig, three-fourths natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe BARK of old trees is almost black and separated into thick, nearly\r\nsquare blocks.\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are alternate, oval, entire, 4 to 6 inches long, dark green\r\nand shining above, paler beneath.\r\n\r\nThe small FLOWERS, which appear in May, are yellowish or cream-white,\r\nsomewhat bell-shaped, the male and female flowers occurring on separate\r\ntrees; the male in clusters of 2 or 3, the female solitary. They are\r\nvisited by many insects.\r\n\r\nThe FRUIT is a pulpy, round, orange-colored or brown berry, an inch or\r\nmore in diameter and containing several flattened, hard, smooth seeds.\r\nThe fruit is strongly astringent while green, but often quite sweet and\r\ndelicious when thoroughly ripe. It is relished by both man and animals,\r\nespecially after a few frosty nights.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is hard, dense, strong, the heartwood brown or black, the wide\r\nsapwood white or yellowish. It is particularly valued for shuttles, golf\r\nclub heads, and similar special uses, but is not of sufficient\r\ncommercial use to warrant its growth as a timber tree.\r\n\r\nThe TEXAS or BLACK PERSIMMON (D. texana Scheele) is described on page\r\n127.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     COMMON SWEETLEAF (Horse-Sugar)\r\n                    Symplocos tinctoria (L.) L’Hér.\r\n\r\n\r\nSweetleaf is usually found along the borders of streams and swamps,\r\nchiefly in East Texas. It seldom grows to a height of more than 30 feet\r\nor a diameter of more than 8 inches. The slender upright branches,\r\nforming an open head, are bluish or grayish, and decidedly roughened by\r\nelevated leaf-scars, or places of attachment of the last crop of leaves.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: COMMON SWEETLEAF (Fruit and flowers about natural size;\r\n                     leaf, one-half natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe thick, shiny, dark green LEAVES, arranged alternately along the\r\nstem, vary from 5 to 6 inches in length and 1 to 2 inches in width. They\r\nremain on the twigs until spring. The leaves are sweet and eagerly\r\nsought for food by livestock.\r\n\r\nThe tiny, pale yellow fragrant FLOWERS are produced in close clusters at\r\nintervals along the branchlets. The FRUIT, a small, one-seeded drupe,\r\nhas a thin dark orange or brown skin. The fruit is eaten to some extent\r\nby deer.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is light, soft and pale red or brown, and has no commercial\r\nvalue. Both leaves and bark yield a yellow dye. The bitter aromatic\r\nroots have been used as a tonic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  TWO-WING SILVERBELL (Snowdrop Tree)\r\n                         Halesia diptera Ellis\r\n\r\n\r\nThis attractive tree or shrub, may grow as a small tree, sometimes as\r\nmuch as 30 feet high, with a trunk 6 to 10 inches in diameter. It occurs\r\nin rich, wet woods and on the borders of swamps and streams, but is\r\nadaptable to many sites. It is found in the southeastern portion of\r\nTexas, being a native of the Gulf Region.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: TWO-WING SILVERBELL (Twig, leaf, and flower one-half\r\n           natural size; fruit about one-sixth natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe BARK of the trunk is brown, divided by irregular longitudinal\r\nfissures, and separating on the surface into thin scales. The bark on\r\nthe twigs forms long, loose, brown fibers, which makes it easy to\r\nidentify during the winter.\r\n\r\nThe alternate, ovate to obovate LEAVES are bright green above, paler and\r\ndowny underneath, 3 to 4 inches long, and 2 to 2½ inches wide. They are\r\nmuch larger on young shoots. The leaves have minute callous teeth.\r\n\r\nThe white FLOWERS, usually about 1 inch long, come before the leaves and\r\nare borne in clusters of 3 to 5. The tree is charming when thickly hung\r\nwith its “silver bells.” The FRUIT is about 2 inches long with two wide,\r\nthin wings, and two (rarely three) narrow wings in between.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is light, soft, strong, close-grained, and light brown, with\r\nthick, lighter-colored sapwood. It is not of commercial importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        CAROLINA ASH (Water Ash)\r\n                       Fraxinus caroliniana Mill.\r\n\r\n\r\nWater ash is common in shaded swamps, westward to the valley of the\r\nNeches River. It forms a tree, rarely more than 40 feet high, with a\r\ntrunk sometimes 12 inches in diameter, and has small branches, making a\r\nnarrow, often round-topped head.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: CAROLINA ASH (Leaflet and fruit, three-fourths natural\r\n                 size; leaf, one-fourth natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe BARK is thin, light gray, and marked by large irregularly shaped\r\nround patches which separate into small, thin, close scales.\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are compounded, 7 to 12 inches long, thick and firm when\r\nmature, with 5 to 7, ovate to oblong, finely to coarsely toothed\r\nleaflets, 3 to 6 inches long, 2 to 3 inches wide, dark green above, and\r\npaler below.\r\n\r\nThe small male and female FLOWERS appear on separate trees, in February\r\nor March. The FRUIT is elliptic to oblong-ovate, frequently\r\nthree-winged, 2 inches long, ⅓ to ¾ inch wide. The wing extends below\r\nthe body of the fruit and narrows into a stipitate (stalk-like) base.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is light, soft, weak, close-grained, nearly white, sometimes\r\nyellowish, with thick, lighter-colored sapwood. It is used chiefly for\r\nfuel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               WHITE ASH\r\n                         Fraxinus americana L.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhite ash is found in East Texas to the valley of the Trinity River. It\r\ngrows best in the rich moist soils of upper bottomlands. The bark is\r\ngray and furrowed, the branchlets smooth and gray with rust-colored\r\nwinter buds.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: WHITE ASH (Twig and fruit, one-half natural size; leaf,\r\n                        one-third natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe compound opposite LEAVES are generally straight, 8 to 12 inches\r\nlong, with 5 to 9 (usually 7) sharp pointed leaflets, dark green above\r\nand paler and whitish beneath.\r\n\r\nThe male and female FLOWERS appear on separate trees, the male in dense\r\nreddish-purple clusters and the female in more open branches. The FRUIT\r\nis a samara, 1 to 1½ inches long, resembling the blade of a canoe paddle\r\nin outline, with the smooth, terete body at the handle end. The fruit\r\nmatures in late summer and is distributed effectively by the winds.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD of white ash is extremely valuable because of its toughness and\r\nelasticity. It is preferred for small tool handles, athletic equipment,\r\nand agricultural implements, and is used extensively for furniture and\r\ninterior finish.\r\n\r\nThe ashes comprise the only group of trees in eastern America that have\r\nopposite, pinnately compound leaves with 5 or more leaflets. This fact\r\nprovides a ready means of identifying the group. There are at least\r\nseven other species of ash in Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               GREEN ASH\r\n                     Fraxinus pennsylvanica Marsh.\r\n\r\n\r\nGreen ash is a common tree along streams as far west as the Guadalupe\r\nRiver. It attains a height of 50 feet or more, has spreading branches\r\nand a trunk ranging up to 2 feet in diameter. The TWIGS are smooth,\r\nround, and ashy gray, marked by pale lenticels and rusty bud-scales.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: GREEN ASH (Fruit, two-thirds natural size; leaf,\r\n       one-third natural size; twig, three-fourths natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe BARK is ½ inch or more thick; brown, tinged with red, and slightly\r\nfurrowed or ridged. The LEAVES are opposite compound, 10 to 12 inches\r\nlong, with 5 to 9 pointed leaflets slightly toothed on the margin. They\r\ndiffer from those of white ash in being lustrous green on both sides or\r\nslightly paler beneath. The terminal leaflet is frequently askew from\r\nthe main axis of the rachis.\r\n\r\nThe small, male and female FLOWERS occur on separate trees.\r\n\r\nThe FRUIT is flat, winged, 1 to 1½ inches long, ¼ to ⅓ inch wide, the\r\nwing portion extending well down past the middle of the terete,\r\nmany-rayed body. The wing is sometimes square or slightly notched at the\r\nouter end.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is heavy, hard, rather strong, brittle, and coarse-grained. It\r\nis used for the same purposes as white ash but is not as desirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SWAMP PRIVET (Common Adelia)\r\n                  Forestiera acuminata (Michx.) Poir.\r\n\r\n\r\nSwamp privet or forestiera is found along river banks, lakes, and\r\nstanding water over eastern Texas to the Colorado River. It is usually a\r\nlarge shrub but often becomes a small tree, less than 30 feet high, with\r\na short trunk usually less than 8 inches in diameter. Its youngest\r\nbranches are slender, somewhat hairy, slightly angular, and vary in\r\ncolor from yellowish-green to brown. They become darker and more rounded\r\nthe second season.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: SWAMP PRIVET (Leaves, one-fifth natural size; fruit,\r\n                        one-half natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe BARK is thin, dark brown to brownish-gray, close, and slightly\r\nridged.\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are thin, simple, opposite, 2½ to 4 inches long, 1 to 1½\r\ninches wide, pointed at both ends, yellowish-green on the upper surface,\r\npaler on the lower surface, and slightly toothed above the middle.\r\n\r\nThe FLOWERS appear in April before the leaves. They are of two kinds,\r\nborne separately on the same tree, rather small and in clusters.\r\n\r\nThe FRUIT, a drupe, falls when ripe in May or June. It is about 1 inch\r\nlong and ¼ inch wide, oblong, and tipped with a point. The ripe fruit is\r\ndeep purple, and contains a tough, dry pulp and a one-seeded stone.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is close-grained, yellowish-brown, weak, and rather soft. It\r\nhas no economic use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     FRINGETREE (White Fringetree)\r\n                       Chionanthus virginicus L.\r\n\r\n\r\nChildren give this tree, with its drooping, fringy, white flowers, such\r\nnames as “grancy-gray beard” and “old-man’s beard.” Beautiful both in\r\nflower and fruit, it is a desirable tree for ornamental planting. It\r\noccurs naturally in loamy soil over the eastern part of the state to the\r\nvalley of the Brazos River and generally grows in the shade of other\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRINGETREE (Flower, three-fourths natural size; leaf and\r\n                     fruit, one-half natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe BARK is similar to that of a young ash, but is rougher and whiter.\r\nIt has tonic properties, and is used in domestic remedies.\r\n\r\nThe rather large, ovate LEAVES are 4 to 8 inches long, and ½ to 4 inches\r\nwide, dark green on the upper surface, paler underneath, and turning a\r\nclear bright yellow in autumn. The leaves are opposite, and leave\r\nconspicuous scars when they fall.\r\n\r\nThe odd white FLOWERS, which appear with the very young leaves, are\r\nborne in long, loose drooping panicles. The petals are very narrow and\r\nlong, giving the effect of fringe.\r\n\r\nThe FRUIT is a dark blue-purple drupe, sometimes as much as an inch\r\nlong, with a glaucous bloom, and borne in loose, drooping panicles. It\r\nis an excellent deer and bird food.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   NORTHERN CATALPA (Western Catalpa)\r\n                        Catalpa speciosa Warder\r\n\r\n\r\nCatalpa, often miscalled “catawba”, is found naturalized in eastern\r\nTexas and occurs on various qualities of soil, most frequently on rich,\r\nmoist bottoms. It is a medium-sized tree, rarely exceeding 50 feet in\r\nheight and 15 inches in diameter. The trunk is usually short and the\r\nhead broad with spreading branches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NORTHERN CATALPA (Leaf, one-third natural size; twig and\r\n     seed, two-thirds natural size; pod, one-fourth natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe BARK varies from dark gray to brown, and is slightly rough, being\r\ndivided into narrow, shallow strips or flakes.\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are simple, opposite, cordate-based, long-pointed, 6 to 10\r\ninches long, and softly pubescent beneath.\r\n\r\nThe FLOWERS appear in clusters or panicles in April or May, and are 1 to\r\n2 inches long, trumpet-shaped, the wavy and spreading corolla irregular,\r\ntwo-lobed, and with a narrow notch on the margin; corolla white with\r\npurple and yellow markings.\r\n\r\nThe FRUIT consists of a bean-like capsule 8 to 16 inches long and from ⅜\r\nto ½ inch in diameter. It hangs on the tree over winter and gradually\r\nsplits into two parts, or valves. The seeds are about 1 inch long and\r\nterminate in wings that are rounded and short-fringed at the ends.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD is rather soft, light, coarse-grained, and durable, in contact\r\nwith the soil. It is used for fence posts, poles and fuel, and\r\noccasionally for railroad ties. It is a mistake to attempt to grow\r\ncatalpa for fence posts or other uses except on good agricultural soil.\r\n\r\nSOUTHERN CATALPA (C. bignonioides Walt.) has a thin, scaly bark,\r\nabruptly short-acuminate leaf, fetid when crushed. Margin of lower lobe\r\nof flower entire. The valves of the capsule flatten after dehiscence.\r\nThe terminal tuft on the seed forms a point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              DESERTWILLOW\r\n                    Chilopsis linearis (Cav.) Sweet\r\n\r\n\r\nThis interesting tree, so named because of its willow-like leaves, is\r\nclosely related to the catalpa. Often reaching a height of 25 feet and a\r\ndiameter of 10 to 12 inches, it is found usually in dry, gravelly,\r\nporous soils in the valley of the lower Rio Grande and through West\r\nTexas.\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are less than ½ inch wide and from 6 to 12 inches long, light\r\ngreen, and pointed. Their arrangement on the twig is either opposite or\r\nalternate.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: DESERTWILLOW (Leaf, one-third natural size; fruit and\r\n                    flowers, one-half natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe white FLOWERS shade into pale purple and are blotched in their\r\n“throats” with pale purple. They occur in an elongated cluster, or\r\nraceme, opening successively toward the end of the flower stalk.\r\n\r\nThe FRUIT “pods” are capsules 7 to 12 inches long, hard or woody, very\r\nslender, and contain numerous small seeds.\r\n\r\nThe soft, weak, close-grained WOOD is brown streaked with yellow. The\r\nsapwood turns to heartwood in 2 or 3 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           COMMON BUTTONBUSH\r\n                      Cephalanthus occidentalis L.\r\n\r\n\r\nButtonbush of Texas is a small tree or large shrub up to 18 feet high,\r\nwith a straight, tapering trunk up to 12 inches in diameter. Attaining\r\nits largest size in moist rich soil of eastern Texas, it is also found\r\nto the valley of the Rio Grande. The branches are generally upright, the\r\nspreading branchlets with pithy in the centers, often occurring in\r\nwhorls of three from one place on the stem.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: COMMON BUTTONBUSH (Leaf, one-third natural size; fruit\r\n                 and flowers, two-thirds natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES occur in pairs or whorls of 3 (occasionally more) each oval\r\nor elliptical, pointed, rounded at the base, from 2 to 7 inches long by\r\n1 to 3 inches wide. They are thin, dark green above, with a large\r\ncentral midrib, and somewhat hairy beneath. They fall in autumn or\r\nremain on branchlets over winter.\r\n\r\nThe FLOWERS form a creamy white or yellow round head about 1 inch in\r\ndiameter and are borne in clusters. The many small flowers in the head\r\nare fragrant and nectar-bearing. The long thread-like projecting styles\r\nare conspicuous on the flowering heads.\r\n\r\nThe FRUIT consists of a mass of nuts in a globular head forming an\r\naggregate fruit ¾ inch in diameter. The red-brown nutlets have 2 to 4\r\nclosed, 1-seeded portions. The WOOD is of little value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       RUSTY BLACKHAW (Viburnum)\r\n                        Viburnum rufidulum Raf.\r\n\r\n\r\nRusty blackhaw is found in woods and thickets over East Texas. It forms\r\na tree, sometimes 35 feet high, with a trunk over a foot in diameter,\r\nbut is usually much smaller, often flowering as a shrub. The twigs are\r\nashy-gray, becoming dark dull reddish-brown after one to several years.\r\nThe winter buds are densely covered with rusty brown hairs which persist\r\nfor some weeks at the base of the leaf-stalks.\r\n\r\nThe BARK is ¼ to ½ inch thick, becoming roughened into small plate-like,\r\ndark brown scales tinged with red.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: RUSTY BLACKHAW (Fruit and twig, three-quarters natural\r\n                 size; leaf, two-thirds natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe simple LEAVES are opposite or whorled, elliptic to obovate or oval,\r\npointed or blunt at the apex, wedge-shaped or rounded at the base, and\r\nwith fine teeth on the margin. They are leathery in texture, lustrous\r\ndark green above, pale and dull below, about 3 inches long, and 1 to 1½\r\ninches wide.\r\n\r\nThe FLOWERS are small and white; each has five petals and five stamens,\r\nand appear in the spring in dense clusters at the tips of branches.\r\n\r\nThe FRUIT ripens in the fall. It is a bright blue, oval drupe, over ½\r\ninch long, covered with a glaucous bloom, and containing a stony seed ¼\r\ninch long and ⅓ inch wide.\r\n\r\nThe bad smelling WOOD has no economic use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Other Texas Trees\r\n\r\n\r\n                            ARIZONA CYPRESS\r\n                      (Cupressus arizonica Greene)\r\n\r\nis an evergreen native to the mountains of the south Trans-Pecos Region.\r\nIt grows from a height of 30 to 70 feet and 18 to 24 inches in diameter.\r\nThe needles are blue-green. Fruit a cone as large as 1¼ inches in\r\ndiameter. The wood is heavy and used to some extent for fence posts.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ALLIGATOR JUNIPER\r\n                      (Juniperus deppeana Steud.)\r\n\r\ngrows in the mountains of southwestern Texas, normally as a small tree,\r\nor even as a sprawling shrub under adverse conditions. Its name derives\r\nfrom the fact that the bark on older trees somewhat resembles alligator\r\nhide, being broken up into square plates 1 to 2 inches across. The\r\nleaves are about ⅛ inch long, and blue-green in color. The fruit is\r\nberry-like, nearly round, reddish-brown, and matures in two seasons.\r\nSeeds 3-4.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   DROOPING JUNIPER (Weeping Juniper)\r\n                     (Juniperus flaccida Schlect.)\r\n\r\noccurs in this country only on the slopes of the Chisos Mountains in\r\nBrewster County, Texas. It has graceful spreading branches with long\r\nslender, drooping branchlets. After the leaves fall, the thin bright\r\ncinnamon-brown bark separating into thin loose papery scales is\r\ncharacteristic.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            ONE-SEED JUNIPER\r\n                 (Juniperus monosperma [Engelm.] Sarg.)\r\n\r\noccurs throughout western Texas, usually as a spreading shrub or small,\r\nmuch branched tree. The bark is ashy gray, ridged and shreddy. The\r\nleaves resemble those of the alligator juniper, but are gray-green in\r\ncolor, and fringed with minute teeth. The fruit is smaller, usually\r\ncopper colored or occasionally blue, usually one-seeded, and matures in\r\none season.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ROCKY MOUNTAIN JUNIPER\r\n                      (Juniperus scopulorum Sarg.)\r\n\r\noccurs in western Texas where it is often the largest of the junipers\r\nfound there. The bark is reddish-brown or grayish-brown, thin, fibrous,\r\nand divided into flat, interlacing ridges. The leaves are similar to\r\nthose of the alligator juniper, but pale to dark green in color. The\r\nfruit is nearly round, blue, and matures in two seasons. Seeds 1 to 3,\r\nusually 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             TEXAS PALMETTO\r\n                   (Sabal texana [O. F. Cook] Becc.)\r\n\r\nsometimes called palm, but not to be confused with the dwarf palmetto\r\n(Sabal minor [Jacq.] Pers.) found in East Texas, reaches to heights of\r\n30 to 50 feet and often 2 feet in diameter. It is a native of the rich\r\nbottomlands on the Bernando River in Cameron County, Texas, but has been\r\nwidely cultivated and is found along the Gulf Coast, where the trunks\r\nare sometimes used for wharf piles. On the lower Rio Grande the leaves\r\nare used for the thatch of houses.\r\n\r\n\r\n             SOUTHERN BAYBERRY (Sweet Myrtle or Wax Myrtle)\r\n                          (Myrica cerifera L.)\r\n\r\nsweet myrtle is found in East Texas, usually in swamp lands. Its small\r\nyellow-green leaves are fragrant with a balsam-like resinous odor. Light\r\ngreen berries, about ⅛ inch in diameter remain on the trees during the\r\nwinter months and are coated with a thick, pale blue wax. Bay berry\r\ncandles are made from the wax.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         RIO GRANDE COTTONWOOD\r\n              (Populus fremontii var. wislizenii S. Watts)\r\n\r\nis one of several cottonwoods growing in West Texas. Five other\r\ncottonwoods are native to the western part of the state. Wood is used\r\nfor fuel and rafters of Mexican houses. It is not durable in the ground,\r\nbut is fast growing on most areas. Populus tremuloides Michx., called\r\nquaking aspen or aspen popple, is a small-leafed, white-barked tree of\r\nthe Trans-Pecos Region.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SPECKLED ALDER (Hazel Alder)\r\n                    (Alnus rugosa [Du Roi] Spreng.)\r\n\r\noccurs in East Texas west to approximately the 97th meridian. It is a\r\nthicket-forming shrub with thick foliage and is one of the first plants\r\nto leaf out in the spring. Birds feed upon the numerous nutlets produced\r\nby the woody, cone-like structure.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SWEET ACACIA (Huisache)\r\n                    (Acacia farnesiana [L.] Willd.)\r\n\r\nfound mainly in South Texas, is a small, spiny shrub, with bright yellow\r\nflowers. Fruit a turgid, woody pod. The wood is heavy, hard, and a rich,\r\nreddish-brown.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                GUAJILLO\r\n                      (Acacia berlandieri Benth.)\r\n\r\npronounced “wa-he-o”, is the famous honey plant of the Lone Star State.\r\nFrom its white flowers bees produce a water-white honey, highly valued\r\nfor its flavor and purity. Guajillo occurs in South Texas, and resembles\r\nthe other trees in the acacia group. The wood is used locally for fuel.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   GREAT LEADTREE (Mexican Leadtree)\r\n               (Leucaena pulverulenta [Schlecht] Benth.)\r\n\r\nsometimes called “tepehuaje” or mimosa, is found on the rich moist soil\r\nof river banks and small streams only a few miles from the mouth of the\r\nRio Grande River. It grows 50 to 60 feet high and 18 inches in diameter.\r\nThe finely divided leaves give the tree the appearance of a huge fern.\r\nSeed pods are 10 to 12 inches long. The wood is heavy, hard, very\r\nclose-grained, rich dark brown with a clear yellow sapwood. It is\r\nconsidered valuable and is sometimes manufactured into lumber. Two other\r\nspecies, (L. greggii S. Wats.) and (L. retusa Benth.), are found in West\r\nTexas but are smaller.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       TEXAS SOPHORA (Coral Bean)\r\n                    (Sophora affinis Torr. and Gray)\r\n\r\nalso called “bear berry”, and pink or beaded locust, is a native to most\r\nall of Texas. It occurs as a small sized tree, 18 to 20 feet tall and 8\r\nto 10 inches in diameter. The branches are slightly zigzag, bright green\r\nwhen young turning to orange-brown. The leaves are 6 to 9 inches long,\r\nmade up of from 13 to 19 leaflets. In the fall, it is loaded with\r\nclusters of black bean pods. The pods are peculiar in shape in that they\r\nare pinched in at each seed giving it the appearance of a string of\r\nbeads. In fact, it is often called the “necklace tree” for that reason.\r\nThe wood is very hard, light red in color, with a thick bright clear\r\nyellow sapwood.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       TEXAS PORLIERIA (Guayacan)\r\n               (Porlieria angustifolia [Engelm.] A. Gray)\r\n\r\nor soap bush, an evergreen of southern and western Texas, is usually a\r\nshrub, but occasionally reaches 8 inches in diameter and 30 feet in\r\nheight. It is a source of early spring honey in the Rio Grande Valley.\r\nIts wood is heavy, hard, and exceptionally durable. Guayacan, sometimes\r\ncalled guaiacum, is the hardest wood in Texas and the United States. The\r\nlignum-vitae of commerce is produced from another species.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                BARETTA\r\n                 (Helietta parvifolia [A. Gray] Benth.)\r\n\r\na native of the Rio Grande Valley and abundant in Starr County where it\r\nmay form considerable thickets, this small, slender evergreen is seldom\r\nmore than 5 or 6 feet tall. On limestone ridges of the Sierra Madre of\r\nNuevo Leon it reaches 20 to 25 feet high. Its leaves are trifoliate, 1½\r\nto 2 inches long, and conspicuously marked with black glandular dots.\r\nThe branches are brownish-red, but with bright yellow, new growth. The\r\nspecies is not native to any other section of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             TREE OF HEAVEN\r\n                 (Ailanthus altissima [Mill.] Swingle)\r\n\r\nis native to the Orient but has been introduced to this country where it\r\nhas grown wild and occurs generally throughout Texas. The long,\r\npinnately compound leaves, 24 to 48 inches long, with 11 to 41 leaflets,\r\nare glandular toothed at the base. The flowers and bruised leaves have a\r\ndisagreeable odor. The tree is fast growing and spreads by suckers as\r\nwell as by seed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHINABERRY\r\n                          (Melia azedarach L.)\r\n\r\nalthough a native of Asia, is so widely grown in Texas as an ornamental\r\nthat it can be seen almost anywhere. It is a member of the mahogany\r\nfamily. The bark is furrowed, with the ridges flat-topped. The alternate\r\nleaves are twice-compound and 10 to 32 inches long. The leaflets are\r\nalternate, ovate to elliptic, sharply toothed or lobed, ¾ to 2 inches\r\nlong, light green and usually smooth. The flowers are showy,\r\nlilac-colored, fragrant, nearly an inch across, and arranged in loose\r\nclusters which appear in April. The fruit is nearly round, ½ to ¾ inch\r\nin diameter, fleshy, and yellow when mature. The wood is moderately\r\nheavy and moderately hard, light reddish-brown in color, with a rather\r\nnarrow, yellowish sapwood. Formerly it was much used for cabinet-work.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    AMERICAN SMOKETREE (Chittamwood)\r\n                        (Cotinus obovatus Raf.)\r\n\r\na member of the sumac family, it grows along the Medina and Guadalupe\r\nRivers and in Kendall County, Texas. Occasionally it reaches a height of\r\n30 feet and 12 inches in diameter, but usually grows as a shrub or small\r\ntree, its trunk dividing into several stems 10 feet or so above the\r\nground. The wood is bright, clear, rich orange color, and yields the\r\nsame color dye. Sometimes it is used for fence posts. C. coggygria, the\r\nsmoketree of gardens, is cultivated in the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             TEXAS PISTACHE\r\n                       (Pistacia texana Swingle)\r\n\r\na less common member of the sumac family, is found native on limestone\r\ncliffs and the rocky bottoms of canyons along the lower Pecos River in\r\nValverde County, Texas. It reaches a height of 15 to 20 feet and\r\nproduces a fruit resembling the pistachio nut of commerce, except that\r\nit is smaller in size.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             EASTERN WAHOO\r\n                     (Euonymus atropurpureus Jacq.)\r\n\r\nalso called arrow-wood and burning bush in some localities is a small\r\ntree rarely over 20 feet high and 4 to 6 inches in diameter. The bark is\r\nthin and covered with thin, tiny scales. The wood is heavy, hard, white,\r\ntinged with orange. The leaves are opposite, thin, and finely serrate.\r\nIn the fall and winter the tree is characterized by bright red berries\r\nin lighter red, 4-lobed capsules. It is a native of East Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  FLORIDA MAPLE (Southern Sugar Maple)\r\n                         (Acer barbatum Michx.)\r\n\r\ngrows in East Texas and resembles the sugar maple (A. saccharum Marsh.)\r\nwith which it blends in Northeast Texas, except that the tips of the\r\nleaves of A. barbatum Michx. are more rounded and the young leaves are\r\nhairy on the underside when they first unfold.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             BIGTOOTH MAPLE\r\n                      (Acer grandidentatum Nutt.)\r\n\r\na maple native to the mountains and canyons of the Trans-Pecos Region of\r\nTexas, grows to 30 and 40 feet high and occasionally 8 to 10 inches in\r\ndiameter. Its bright red branchlets are nearly encircled by the narrow\r\nleaf-scars. Leaf lobes few toothed or nearly entire. When accessible,\r\nthe wood is valuable for fuel and building material.\r\n\r\n\r\n            UVALDE BIGTOOTH MAPLE (Sugar or Mountain Maple)\r\n           (Acer grandidentatum var. sinuosum [Rend.] Little)\r\n\r\nresembles the above two maples but is confined to the Balcones\r\nEscarpment in western Texas along creek bottoms in parts of Kendall,\r\nBandera, and Uvalde Counties. It is a rare tree, seldom more than 20\r\nfeet high. Branchlets pale red-brown and marked by pale lenticels during\r\ntheir first season, ultimately turning dull gray-brown.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            FLORIDA BASSWOOD\r\n                        (Tilia floridana Small)\r\n\r\ngrows from East Texas to the Edwards Plateau. The leaves are coarsely\r\nserrate with sharp-pointed tips, dark green and glaucous above, and pale\r\nor covered with a silvery-white bloom and often axillary hairs below.\r\nThe tree may reach 40 to 50 feet high and 12 to 15 inches in diameter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CAROLINA BASSWOOD\r\n                       (Tilia caroliniana Mill.)\r\n\r\nlocated in East Texas to the Edwards Plateau, Kendall County. Underside\r\nof the ovate leaves covered with soft, short, brownish-white hairs;\r\nsmooth on upper surface and coarse-veined. Leaves usually obliquely\r\ntruncate at the base.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                TAMARISK\r\n                           (Tamarix species)\r\n\r\nall of the many species of Tamarix are native to the Mediterranean\r\nRegion or to East Asia and India. However, three of them (T. araiculata\r\nVahl, T. gallica L., and T. pentandra Pall.), are widely planted in the\r\nSouth. All are shrubby in nature, or they may attain the stature of\r\nsmall trees. When of tree size, the trunk normally is short, with main\r\nbranches quite close to the ground. This gives rise to a wide-spreading\r\nbushy crown. The leaves are sparse, delicate, evergreen, alternate,\r\nsimple, small, scale-like, pale green to dull or bluish-green, ovate or\r\nrhombic, sharp pointed, sometimes with thin, dry margins, and without\r\npetioles. The foliage presents a leathery appearance. The wood is hard,\r\nheavy, white to light straw colored, shows a prominent mottled wavy\r\npattern when quarter-sawn, and takes a high polish.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     BUCKTHORN BUMELIA (Buckthorn)\r\n                     (Bumelia lycioides [L.] Pers.)\r\n\r\nalso called ironwood, is found along the Southeast Coastal Region of\r\nTexas. In contrast to B. lanuginosa, the leaves are smooth instead of\r\nhairy on the underside. They are also thin. Sometimes grows 25 to 30\r\nfeet in height with a short trunk rarely more than 6 inches in diameter.\r\nIt has stout, flexible branches, usually unarmed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             TEXAS BUMELIA\r\n                (Bumelia lanuginosa var. rigida A. Gray)\r\n\r\noccurs in Texas from the upper Brazos River to the Rio Grande and upper\r\nGuadalupe River. It has thick, leathery-like leaves smooth on the\r\nunderside. The lateral branches are spiny and occasionally end in stout\r\npines; branchlets slender, often zigzag, and lustrous. The fresh-cut\r\nwood of the bumelias in Texas usually produces considerable quantities\r\nof clear viscid gum. Mexicans have given some species of this small tree\r\nthe name “chickle” for that reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   TEXAS PERSIMMON (Black Persimmon)\r\n                       (Diospyros texana Scheele)\r\n\r\nalso called Mexican persimmon, is native to southern and southwestern\r\nTexas, from the Colorado River. It is characterized by 1 to 2 inch\r\nleaves and small edible black fruits, about ¾ inch in diameter. They\r\nwill stain the skin black. Mexicans make a hair dye from the ripe fruit,\r\nwhich has given the plant the local name of “capote”. The wood is heavy\r\nwith a black heartwood often streaked with yellow, and with a bright\r\nyellow sapwood. The wood is used in turnery and for the handles of\r\ntools.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               TEXAS ASH\r\n                  (Fraxinus texensis [A.

Leaves 5 to 8 inches long with usually five,\r\nlong-stalked leaflets. Fruit in short, compact clusters.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      BERLANDIER ASH (Mexican Ash)\r\n                    (Fraxinus berlandieriana A. DC.)\r\n\r\ngrows along the banks of streams and canyons in the San Antonio and\r\nNeuces River watersheds and over the Edwards Plateau. It is rarely more\r\nthan 30 feet tall. The three to five leaflets are smooth. The wood is\r\nlight brown and soft.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     ANACAHUITA (Texas Wild-Olive)\r\n                        (Cordia boisseri A. DC.)\r\n\r\noccurs along the lower Rio Grande Valley, is said to be almost extinct.\r\nIt is a small tree, sometimes 20 feet tall and 6 to 8 inches in\r\ndiameter, noted for its large velvety leaves (4 to 5 inches long and 3\r\nto 4 inches wide), clusters of yellow and white flowers and delicate\r\nivory-white coated fruit. The bark is thin, gray, tinged with red.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 ANAQUA\r\n              (Ehretia anacua [Mier and Berland.] Johnst.)\r\n\r\nalso called knackaway, anama, and yara, occurs in West Texas from the\r\nupper San Marcos River to the Rio Grande River. It is a tree of the\r\ntropics and of about 40 species in its family, is the only one found in\r\nthe United States, and here only in Texas. It is valued as a shade tree\r\nin some communities of South Texas and is noted for its growth and\r\nbeauty. Occasionally it grows to a height of 40 to 50 feet with a trunk\r\n3 feet in diameter, attaining its largest size on the Guadalupe and\r\nNueces Rivers. Anaqua has slender branchlets, without terminal buds, and\r\nleathery, very rough leaves which are almost evergreen. It blooms with\r\nwhite flowers in March and April and has large groups of edible red\r\nberries in June and July. The wood is heavy, close-grained, light brown\r\nand of little value.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             TEXAS MADRONE\r\n                        (Arbutus texana Buckl.)\r\n\r\nalso called Texas Madroño is a small poorly shaped tree found on dry\r\nlimestone hills, and in the valley of the Rio Blanco, and among the\r\nEagle Mountains. The trunk is seldom over one foot in diameter and is\r\nusually divided into several branches near the ground. The leaves are\r\noval to oblong and persistent until the new leaves are formed. The bark\r\nof young stems and branches is smooth, thin, and yellowish-green in\r\ncolor tinged with red. At the base of old trunks the bark, sometimes ¼\r\ninch thick, is dark reddish-brown in color.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             AUSTRIAN PINE\r\n                          (Pinus nigra Arnold)\r\n\r\nis similar in appearance to red pine (P. resinosa Ait.) but needles are\r\nmore rigid. Bark is black to dark brown and the cones are 1½ to 2 inches\r\nlong. The tree is a native of central and southern Europe and Asia\r\nMinor. It has been planted extensively in the U. S. as an ornamental but\r\nis apparently not yet naturalized. It is planted in Texas in windbreak\r\nplantings.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             RUSSIAN-OLIVE\r\n                      (Elaeagnus angustifolia L.)\r\n\r\nis a small tree, not more than 25 feet tall, usually with thorny\r\nbranches. Leaves are simple, alternate, narrow and 2 to 3 inches long,\r\nbright green on the upper surface and silvery underneath. It is a native\r\nof Europe and Asia and is used as an ornamental and in windbreak\r\nplantings in the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   BUFFALOBERRY (Silver Buffaloberry)\r\n                  (Shepherdia argentea [Pursh] Nutt.)\r\n\r\nis a small silver gray-green tree with edible scarlet colored fruit\r\nwhich is useful for making jelly, which may reach 18 to 23 feet in\r\nheight. It generally has narrow oblong leaves ¾ to 2 inches long and\r\ntwigs are often thorny. Its native range is from the northern Great\r\nPlains to Kansas. Useful for windbreak plantings and erosion control.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       SIBERIAN ELM (Chinese Elm)\r\n                           (Ulmus pumila L.)\r\n\r\nis more commonly known in the Plains area as Chinese elm. It is\r\ndrought-resistant and tolerant of a variety of sites but cannot stand\r\ntoo much water. A small tree with slender drooping branches. Clusters of\r\nshort pedicelled winged fruit appear in April or May. The leaves are\r\nsimple, alternate, oval to elliptical, 1 to 2 inches long and leaf edges\r\nare doubly serrate. Widely used for shade and windbreak plantings.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          WINTERBERRY EUONYMUS\r\n                      (Euonymus bungeanus Maxim.)\r\n\r\nwas introduced from China and has adapted well to the southern Great\r\nPlains area centered around the Texas Panhandle. The small tree is very\r\nhardy and drought-resistant. Its very light green leaves are 2 to 4\r\ninches long, pointed and borne on slender petioles. The heavy leaves\r\ncause the petioles to bend giving the foliage a limp or drooping\r\nappearance. Young stems and branches are green, older ones are gray. The\r\nfruit is a four-lobed capsule which, before ripening in the fall, has a\r\npinkish cast. The ripened seeds are bright red.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Tree Identification Guide\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following guide has been included in the Eighth edition to assist\r\nschool children and interested adults in the identification of Texas\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nThe guide is non-technical and should be treated as such. More detailed\r\nkeys are available in most public libraries.\r\n\r\nIn the guide, trees are grouped according to their outstanding\r\ncharacteristics which include leaves, leaf arrangement, flowers, fruit\r\nand site.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE SOFTWOODS\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Needles                          Cones\r\n  Shortleaf[1] (page 21)  2 to 3 in a bundle (usually      1½″-2½″ long\r\n                          2); 3″-5″ long\r\n  Loblolly (page 20)      3 in a bundle; 6″-9″ long        3″-5″ long\r\n  Longleaf (page 22)      3 in a bundle; 10″-15″ long      6″-10″ long\r\n  Slash (page 23)         2 to 3 in a bundle (usually      4″-6″ long\r\n                          2); 8″-12″ long\r\n\r\nNote: Not included above but commonly found in the longleaf pine range\r\nis a cross between loblolly and longleaf pine.
